These descriptions do not\r\nnecessarily exactly match the title of the sections verbatim, and the\r\nsame section occasionally appears twice, with different descriptions.\r\nThere is a more detailed index at the end of the volume, with page\r\nreferences.\r\n\r\nMinor errors, attributable to the printer, have been corrected. Please\r\nsee the transcriber’s note at the end of this text for details regarding\r\nthe handling of any issues encountered during its preparation.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PENNSYLVANIA STATE CAPITOL BUILDING]\r\n\r\n                             DAILY STORIES\r\n                                   OF\r\n                              PENNSYLVANIA\r\n\r\n\r\n             Prepared for publication in the leading daily\r\n                       newspapers of the State by\r\n\r\n                         FREDERIC A.

In this\r\narrangement they can be more readily found when desired for quick\r\nreference or study.\r\n\r\nThese stories have been prepared from many different sources, not a few\r\nfrom original manuscripts, or from writings which have not been\r\nheretofore used; many are rewritten from familiar publications, but too\r\nfrequent reference to such sources has been omitted as these would\r\nencumber the foot of so many pages that the stories would require a much\r\nlarger book or a second volume, either of which would be objectionable\r\nand unnecessary.\r\n\r\nIt is a hopeless task to acknowledge the many courtesies received, but\r\nin some slight manner the author must recognize the friendship of Prof.\r\nHiram H. Shenk, custodian of records in the State Library, who so\r\ngenerously placed him in touch with many valuable papers, books and\r\nmanuscripts, and in many ways assisted in much of the historical data.\r\nThe names of Dr. Thomas L. Montgomery, Librarian Historical Society of\r\nPennsylvania; Dr. George P. Donehoo, former State Librarian; the late\r\nJulius Sachse; the late Dr. Hugh Hamilton; former Governor Hon. Edwin S.\r\nStuart and Colonel Henry W. Shoemaker, each of whom contributed such\r\nassistance as was requested. The valuable help extended by officers and\r\nassistants in the State Library, The Historical Society of Pennsylvania,\r\nThe Wyoming Historical and Geological Society, The Historical Society of\r\nDauphin County, The Lycoming County Historical Society and other similar\r\norganizations deserves particular mention and gratitude.\r\n\r\nIt is also a matter of intense satisfaction that the author acknowledges\r\nthe following progressive newspapers which carried the stories, and the\r\neditors of which so materially assisted by their personal attention in\r\nmaking his work such an unusual success: Allentown Chronicle and News,\r\nAltoona Mirror, Berwick Enterprise, Bethlehem Globe, Bloomsburg Morning\r\nPress, Carlisle Sentinel, Chester Times, Coatesville Record, Danville\r\nMorning News, Doylestown Democrat, Du Bois Courier, Easton Free Press,\r\nEllwood City Ledger, Erie Dispatch-Herald, Farrell News, Greensburg\r\nRecord, Greenville Advance Argus, Harrisburg Evening News, Hazleton\r\nStandard-Sentinel, Indiana Gazette, Johnstown Tribune, Lancaster\r\nIntelligencer, Lansford Evening Record, Mauch Chunk Daily News,\r\nMeadville Tribune-Republican, Milton Evening Standard, Mount Carmel\r\nItem, Norristown Times-Herald, Philadelphia Public Ledger, Pittsburgh\r\nChronicle-Telegraph, Pittston Gazette, Pottsville Republican, Reading\r\nHerald-Telegram, Ridgway Record, Scranton Republican, Shamokin Dispatch,\r\nSharon Herald, Shenandoah Herald, Stroudsburg Times-Democrat, Sunbury\r\nDaily Item, Tamaqua Courier, Titusville Herald, Uniontown Herald,\r\nWaynesboro Record-Herald, Wilkes Barre Times-Leader, Williamsport Sun,\r\nand York Gazette.\r\n\r\n                                             FREDERIC A.

Out in Pennsylvania Line,\r\n                            January 1, 1781\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the year 1780 drew to a close there were warm disputes in the\r\nPennsylvania regiments as to the terms on which the men had been\r\nenlisted. This led to such a condition by New Year’s Day, 1781, that\r\nthere broke out in the encampment at Morristown, N. J., a mutiny among\r\nthe soldiers that required the best efforts of Congress, the Government\r\nof Pennsylvania and the officers of the army to subdue.\r\n\r\nNew Year’s Day being a day of customary festivity, an extra proportion\r\nof rum was served to the soldiers. This, together with what they were\r\nable to purchase, was sufficient to influence the minds of the men,\r\nalready predisposed by a mixture of real and imaginary injuries, to\r\nbreak forth into outrage and disorder.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania Line comprised 2500 troops, almost two-thirds of the\r\nContinental Army, the soldiers from the other colonies having, in the\r\nmain, gone home. The officers maintained that at least a quarter part of\r\nthe soldiers had enlisted for three years and the war. This seems to\r\nhave been the fact, but the soldiers, distressed and disgusted for want\r\nof pay and clothing, and seeing the large bounties paid to those who\r\nre-enlisted, declared that the enlistment was for three years or the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nAs the three years had now expired, they demanded their discharges. They\r\nwere refused, and on January 1, 1781, the whole line, 1300 in number,\r\nbroke out into open revolt. An officer attempting to restrain them was\r\nkilled and several others were wounded.\r\n\r\nUnder the leadership of a board of sergeants, the men marched toward\r\nPrinceton, with the avowed purpose of going to Philadelphia to demand of\r\nCongress a fulfillment of their many promises.\r\n\r\nGeneral “Mad” Anthony Wayne was in command of these troops, and was much\r\nbeloved by them. By threats and persuasions he tried to bring them back\r\nto duty until their real grievances could be redressed. They would not\r\nlisten to him; and when he cocked his pistol, in a menacing manner, they\r\npresented their bayonets to his breast, saying:\r\n\r\n“We respect and love you; you have often led us into the line of battle;\r\nbut we are no longer under your command. We warn you to be on your\r\nguard. If you fire your pistol or attempt to enforce your commands, we\r\nshall put you instantly to death.”\r\n\r\nGeneral Wayne appealed to their patriotism. They pointed to the broken\r\npromises of Congress. He reminded them of the effect their conduct would\r\nhave on the enemy. They pointed to their tattered garments and emaciated\r\nforms. They avowed their willingness to support the cause of\r\nindependence if adequate provision could be made for their comfort and\r\nthey boldly reiterated their determination to march to Philadelphia, at\r\nall hazards, to demand from Congress a redress of their grievances.\r\n\r\nGeneral Wayne determined to accompany them to Philadelphia. When they\r\nreached Princeton the soldiers presented the general with a written list\r\nof their demands. These demands appeared so reasonable that he had them\r\nlaid before Congress. They consisted of six general items of complaint\r\nand were signed by William Bearnell and the other sergeants of the\r\ncommittee, William Bouzar, acting as secretary.\r\n\r\nJoseph Reed, President of Pennsylvania, who had been authorized by\r\nCongress to make propositions to the mutineers, advanced near Princeton\r\non January 6, when he wrote to General Wayne in which he expressed some\r\ndoubts as to going into the camp of the insurgents. The general showed\r\nthis letter to the sergeants and they immediately wrote the President:\r\n\r\n“Your Excellency need not be in the least afraid or apprehensive of any\r\nirregularities or ill treatment.”\r\n\r\nPresident Reed went into Princeton. His entry was greeted with the whole\r\nline drawn up for his reception, and every mark of military honor and\r\nrespect was shown him.\r\n\r\nArticles of agreement were finally assented to and confirmed on both\r\nsides, January 7, 1781. These articles consisted of five sections and\r\nrelated to the time of their enlistment, terms of payment, arrearages\r\nand clothes. It was also agreed that the State of Pennsylvania should\r\ncarry out its part of their contract.\r\n\r\nThe agreement was signed by Joseph Reed and General James Potter.\r\n\r\nGeneral Arthur St. Clair, the distinguished Pennsylvanian, and General\r\nLafayette went voluntarily to Princeton and offered their services in\r\nthe settlement of the difficulty, especially as they had learned of the\r\nattempt of the British to win the malcontents to their cause.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Henry Clinton heard of the revolt of the Pennsylvania Line he\r\nmisunderstood the spirit of the mutineers and dispatched two\r\nemissaries—a British sergeant named John Mason and a New Jersey Tory\r\nnamed James Ogden—to the insurgents, with a written offer that, on\r\nlaying down their arms and marching to New York, they should receive\r\ntheir arrearages; be furnished with good clothes, have a free pardon for\r\nall past offenses and be taken under the protection of the British\r\nGovernment and that no military service should be required of them\r\nunless voluntarily offered.\r\n\r\nSir Henry entirely misapprehended the temper of the Pennsylvanians. They\r\nfelt justified in using their power to obtain a redress of grievances,\r\nbut they looked with horror upon the armed oppressors of their country;\r\nand they regarded the act and stain of treason under the circumstances\r\nas worse than the infliction of death.\r\n\r\nClinton’s proposals were rejected with disdain. “See, comrades,” said\r\none of them, “he takes us for traitors. Let us show him that the\r\nAmerican army can furnish but one Arnold, and that America has no truer\r\nfriends than we.”\r\n\r\nThey seized the two emissaries, and delivered them, with Clinton’s\r\npapers, into the hands of General Wayne.\r\n\r\nThe court of inquiry sat January 10, 1781, at Somerset, N. J., with the\r\ncourt composed of General Wayne, president, and General William Irvine,\r\nColonel Richard Butler, Colonel Walter Stewart and Major Benjamin\r\nFishbourne. The court found John Mason and James Ogden guilty and\r\ncondemned them to be hanged.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Colonel Harmar, Inspector General of the Pennsylvania Line,\r\nwas directed to carry the execution into effect. The prisoners were\r\ntaken to “cross roads from the upper ferry from Trenton to Philadelphia\r\nat four lanes’ ends,” and executed.\r\n\r\nThe reward which had been offered for the apprehension of the offenders\r\nwas tendered to the mutineers who seized them. They sealed the pledge of\r\npatriotism by nobly refusing it, saying: “Necessity wrung from us the\r\nact of demanding justice from Congress, but we desire no reward for\r\ndoing our duty to our bleeding country.”\r\n\r\nThe whole movement, when all the circumstances are taken into account,\r\nshould not be execrated as a military rebellion, for, if ever there was\r\na just cause for men to lift up their strength against authority, these\r\nmutineers of the Pennsylvania Line possessed it. It must be acknowledged\r\nthat they conducted themselves in the business, culpable as it was, with\r\nunexpected order and regularity.\r\n\r\nA great part of the Pennsylvania Line was disbanded for the winter, but\r\nwas promptly filled by new recruits in the spring and many of the old\r\nsoldiers re-enlisted.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  General Assembly Occupies New State\r\n                        Capitol, January 2, 1822\r\n\r\n\r\nThe General Assembly of Pennsylvania met in the Dauphin County\r\ncourthouse for the last time December 21, 1821, and then a joint\r\nresolution was adopted:\r\n\r\n“Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives, That when the\r\nLegislature meets at the new State Capitol, on Wednesday, the 2d of\r\nJanuary next, that it is highly proper, before either house proceeds to\r\nbusiness, they unite in prayer to the Almighty God, imploring His\r\nblessing on their future deliberations, and that the joint committee\r\nalready appointed be authorized to make the necessary arrangements for\r\nthat purpose.”\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, January 2, 1822, on motion of Mr. Lehman and Mr. Todd, the\r\nHouse proceeded to the building lately occupied by the Legislature.\r\nThere they joined the procession to the Capitol and attended to the\r\nsolemnities directed by the resolution of December 21, relative to the\r\nceremonies to be observed by the Legislature upon taking possession of\r\nthe State Capitol.\r\n\r\nThe Harrisburg _Chronicle_ of January 3, 1822, printed an account of the\r\nproceedings from which the following is taken:\r\n\r\n“The members of both branches of the Legislature met in the morning at\r\n10 o’clock, at the old State House (court house) whence they moved to\r\nthe Capitol in the following\r\n\r\n                          ORDER OF PROCESSION\r\n              The Architect and his Workmen, two and two.\r\n                                Clergy.\r\n                   Governor and Heads of Departments.\r\n                        Officers of the Senate.\r\n                         Speaker of the Senate.\r\n                  Members of the Senate, two and two.\r\n               Officers of the House of Representatives.\r\n                Speaker of the House of Representatives.\r\n                         Members, two and two.\r\n                                Judges.\r\n                    Civil Authorities of Harrisburg.\r\n                               Citizens.\r\n\r\n“In front of the Capitol the architect and his workmen opened into two\r\nlines and admitted the procession to pass between them and the Capitol.\r\n\r\n“The service was opened by a pertinent and impressive prayer, by Rev.\r\nDr. A. Lochman, of Harrisburg. The prayer was followed by an appropriate\r\ndiscourse, by Rev. D. Mason, principal of Dickinson College, Carlisle,\r\nPa., which concluded as follows:\r\n\r\n“Sixty years have not elapsed since the sound of the first axe was heard\r\nin the woods of Harrisburg. The wild beasts and wilder men occupied the\r\nbanks of the Susquehanna. Since that time, with the mildness which has\r\ncharacterized the descendants of William Penn, and that industry which\r\nhas marked all the generations of Pennsylvania, the forests have been\r\nsubdued, the wild beasts driven away to parts more congenial to their\r\nnature, and the wilder men have withdrawn to regions where they hunt the\r\ndeer and entrap the fish according to the mode practiced by their\r\nancestors.\r\n\r\n“In the room of all these there has started up, in the course of a few\r\nyears, a town respectable for the number of its inhabitants, for its\r\nprogressive industry, for the seat of legislation in this powerful\r\nState.\r\n\r\n“What remains to be accomplished of all our temporal wishes? What more\r\nhave we to say? What more can be said, but go on and prosper, carry the\r\nspirit of your improvements through till the sound of the hammer, the\r\nwhip of the wagoner, the busy hum of man, the voices of innumerable\r\nchildren issuing from the places of instruction, the lofty spires of\r\nworship, till richly endowed colleges of education, till all those arts\r\nwhich embellish man shall gladden the banks of the Susquehanna and the\r\nDelaware, and exact from admiring strangers that cheerful and grateful\r\ntribute, this is the work of a Pennsylvania Legislature!”\r\n\r\nThe act to erect the State Capitol was passed March 18, 1816, and\r\ncarried an appropriation of $50,000. A supplement to this act was\r\napproved February 27, 1819, when there was appropriated $70,000, with\r\nthe provision that the said Capitol should not cost more than $120,000.\r\n\r\nBut a further supplement was approved March 28, 1820, for “the purpose\r\nof constructing columns and capitols there of hewn stone, and to cover\r\nthe roof of the dome, etc.,” there was appropriated $15,000.\r\n\r\nAt this time the total cost of all the public buildings was $275,000,\r\nand consisted of the new Capitol, $135,000; executive offices on both\r\nsides of the Capitol building, $93,000; Arsenal, $12,000, and public\r\ngrounds, its enclosure and embellishment, $35,000.\r\n\r\nThe cornerstone of this new Capitol was laid at 12 o’clock on Monday,\r\nMay 31, 1819, by Governor William Findlay, assisted by Stephen Hills,\r\nthe architect and contractor for the execution of the work; William\r\nSmith, stone cutter, and Valentine Kergan and Samuel White, masons, in\r\nthe presence of the Commissioners and a large concourse of citizens. The\r\nceremony was followed by the firing of three volleys from the public\r\ncannon.\r\n\r\nThe newspaper account of the event states that the above-mentioned\r\ncitizens then partook of a cold collation, provided on the public ground\r\nby Mr. Rahn.\r\n\r\nThe Building Commissioners deposited in the cornerstone the following\r\ndocuments:\r\n\r\nCharter of Charles II to William Penn.\r\n\r\nDeclaration of Independence.\r\n\r\nConstitution of Pennsylvania, 1776.\r\n\r\nArticles of Confederation and perpetual union between the several\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nCopy of so much of an act of the General Assembly of Pennsylvania, by\r\nwhich indemnity was made to the heirs of William Penn for their interest\r\nin Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nTreaty of peace and acknowledgment by Great Britain of the independence\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nConstitution of the United States, 1787.\r\n\r\nConstitution of Pennsylvania, 1790.\r\n\r\nActs of the Legislature of Pennsylvania, by which the seat of government\r\nwas removed from Philadelphia to Lancaster and Harrisburg, and the\r\nbuilding of a State Capitol at the latter place authorized.\r\n\r\nA list of the names of the Commissioners, architects, stonecutter and\r\nchief masons; likewise, a list of the then officers of the Government of\r\nPennsylvania, embracing the Speakers of the two Houses of the\r\nLegislature, the Governor, the heads of departments, the Judges of the\r\nSupreme Court and Attorney General, with the names of the President and\r\nVice President of the United States.\r\n\r\nIt was a singular oversight that this cornerstone was not marked as\r\nsuch, and in after years it was not known at which corner of the\r\nbuilding the stone was situated.\r\n\r\nAn act providing for the furnishing of the State Capitol was approved\r\nMarch 30, 1821: Section 1. The Governor, Auditor General, State\r\nTreasurer, William Graydon, Jacob Bucher, Francis R. Shunk and Joseph A.\r\nMcGinsey were appointed Commissioners to superintend the furnishing of\r\nthe State Capitol. This able commission expended the $15,000\r\nappropriated, and the new Capitol was a credit to the Commonwealth of\r\nPennsylvania when the General Assembly formally occupied it January 2,\r\n1822.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Lucretia Mott, Celebrated Advocate of\r\n                   Anti-Slavery, Born January 3, 1793\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest settlement at Germantown, and especially in the period\r\nfollowing the Revolutionary War, there were many thoughtful people in\r\nall walks of life who considered slavery to be an evil which should be\r\nstopped. But the question of actually freeing the slaves was first\r\nseriously brought forward in 1831, by William Lloyd Garrison, in his\r\nexcellent paper, “The Liberator,” published in Boston.\r\n\r\nSeventy-five delegates met in Philadelphia in 1833 to form a National\r\nAnti-Slavery Society. It was unpopular in those stirring days to be an\r\nabolitionist. John Greenleaf Whittier acted as one of the secretaries,\r\nand four women, all Quakers, attended the convention.\r\n\r\nWhen the platform of this new society was being discussed, one of the\r\nfour women rose to speak. A gentleman present afterward said: “I had\r\nnever before heard a woman speak at a public meeting. She said only a\r\nfew words, but these were spoken so modestly, in such sweet tones and\r\nyet so decisively, that no one could fail to be pleased.” The woman who\r\nspoke was Lucretia Mott.\r\n\r\nLucretia Coffin was born in Nantucket January 3, 1793. In 1804 her\r\nparents, who were Quakers, removed to Boston. She was soon afterward\r\nsent to the Nine Partners’ Boarding School in Duchess County, N. Y.,\r\nwhere her teacher (Deborah Willetts) lived until 1879. Thence she went\r\nto Philadelphia, where her parents were residing.\r\n\r\nAt the age of eighteen years she married James Mott. In 1818 she became\r\na preacher among Friends, and all her long life she labored for the good\r\nof her fellow creatures, especially for those who were in bonds of any\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nShe was ever a most earnest advocate of temperance, pleaded for the\r\nfreedom of the slaves, and was one of the active founders of the\r\n“American Anti-Slavery Society” in Philadelphia in 1833.\r\n\r\nShe was appointed a delegate to the World’s Anti-Slavery convention,\r\nheld in London in 1840, but was denied a seat in it on account of her\r\nsex. She also was a very prominent advocate of the emancipation of her\r\nsex from the disabilities to which law and custom subjected them.\r\n\r\nWhen the Female Anti-Slavery Society was organized Lucretia Mott was its\r\nfirst president and served in that office for many years.\r\n\r\nThe anti-slavery enthusiasts dedicated a building, Pennsylvania Hall, in\r\nPhiladelphia, May 14, 1838, which excited the rage of their enemies and\r\nthe mob burned the building three days later. The excited crowd marched\r\nthrough the streets, threatening also to burn the houses of the\r\nabolitionists.\r\n\r\nThe home of Mr. and Mrs. James Mott stood on Ninth Street above Race.\r\nLucretia Mott and her husband were warned of their danger, but refused\r\nto leave their home. Their son ran in from the street, crying, “They’re\r\ncoming!”\r\n\r\nThe mob intended to burn the house, but a young man friendly to the\r\nfamily assumed leadership and with the cry “On to Motts!” led them past\r\nthe place and the mob satisfied its thirst by burning a home for colored\r\norphans, and did not return.\r\n\r\nSuch incidents failed to daunt the spirit of Lucretia Mott, and her\r\nhusband, who approved the part she took.\r\n\r\nA meeting of the Anti-Slavery Society in New York City was broken up by\r\nroughs, and several of the speakers, as they left the hall, were beaten\r\nby the mob. Lucretia Mott was being escorted from the hall by a\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\nWhen she noticed some of the other ladies were frightened, she asked her\r\nfriend to leave her and take care of the others. “Who will look after\r\nyou?” he asked. Lucretia laid her hand on the arm of one of the roughest\r\nin the mob, saying: “This man will see me safely through the crowd.”\r\nPleased by the mark of confidence, the rioter did as she asked and took\r\nher to safety.\r\n\r\nThe home of the Motts was always open for the relief of poor colored\r\npersons, and they helped in sending fugitive slaves to places of refuge.\r\nOn one occasion the Motts heard the noise of an approaching mob. Mr.\r\nMott rushed to the door and found a poor colored man, pursued by the\r\nmob, rushing toward the friendly Mott house. He entered and escaped by\r\nthe rear door. A brick hurled at Mr. Mott fortunately missed him, but\r\nbroke the door directly over his head.\r\n\r\nA sequel to the riot at Christiana, Lancaster County, September 11,\r\n1851, which occurred on the farm then owned by Levi Powell, was the\r\narrest of Castner Hanway and Elijah Lewis, two Quakers of the\r\nneighborhood, and nearly fifty others, mostly Negroes, on the charge of\r\nhigh treason for levying war against the Government of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe trial began in the United States Court at Philadelphia, before\r\nJudges Green and Kane, November 24. It was one of the most exciting ever\r\nheld in the State. Thaddeus Stevens, John M. Read, Theodore C. Cuyler,\r\nand Joseph J. Lewis, conducted the defense, while District Attorney John\r\nW. Ashmead was assisted by the Attorney General of Maryland, and by\r\nJames Cooper, then a Whig United States Senator from Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nLucretia Mott attended the trial personally every day, and after the\r\nelaborate argument of counsel, Judge Green delivered his charge. The\r\njury returned a verdict, in ten minutes, of “not guilty.”\r\n\r\nA colored man named Dangerfield was seized on a farm near Harrisburg on\r\na charge of being a fugitive slave. He was manacled and taken to\r\nPhiladelphia for trial.\r\n\r\nThe abolitionists engaged a lawyer to defend the Negro. Lucretia Mott\r\nsat by the side of the prisoner during the trial. Largely through her\r\npresence and influence Dangerfield was released. The mob outside the\r\ncourt awaited Dangerfield to deliver him over to his former master, but\r\na band of young Quakers deceived the crowd by accompanying another Negro\r\nto a carriage and Dangerfield walked off in another direction.\r\n\r\nLucretia Mott and her friends were rejoiced to see the Negroes all free.\r\nThere was still much to be done after the Civil War. This noble woman\r\nremained a hard worker for their cause all through her life.\r\n\r\nLucretia Mott died in Philadelphia, November 21, 1881, at the age of\r\nnearly ninety years. Thousands attended her funeral, the proceedings\r\nwere mostly in silence. At last some one said, “Will no one speak?” The\r\nanswer came back: “Who can speak now? The preacher is dead.” Her motto\r\nin life had been “Truth for authority, not authority for truth.”\r\n\r\nLucretia Mott’s influence still lives. Tuskegee Institute in Alabama,\r\nHampton Institute in Virginia, and Lincoln University in Chester County,\r\nPennsylvania, are institutions made possible by such as she, and in them\r\nyoung colored persons are taught occupations and professions in which\r\nthey can render the best service to themselves and to their country.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Samuel Maclay Resigned From United\r\n                     States Senate January 4, 1809\r\n\r\n\r\nA monument was unveiled in memory of Samuel Maclay, a great\r\nPennsylvanian, October 16, 1908. The scene of these impressive\r\nceremonies was a beautiful little cemetery close by the old Dreisbach\r\nChurch, a few miles west of Lewisburg in the picturesque Buffalo Valley,\r\nUnion County.\r\n\r\nSamuel Maclay was the eighth United States Senator from Pennsylvania and\r\nhad the proud distinction of being the brother of William Maclay, one of\r\nthe first United States Senators from Pennsylvania. The Maclays are the\r\nonly brothers to ever sit in the highest legislative body of this\r\ncountry. The third brother, John, was also prominent and served in the\r\nSenate of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe imposing shaft was erected by Pennsylvania at a cost of only $1000,\r\nwhich included the contract for the marble shaft and the reinterment of\r\nthe Senator’s body.\r\n\r\nMiss Helen Argyl Maclay, of Belleville, a great-great-granddaughter of\r\nSamuel Maclay, unveiled the monument assisted by her two brothers, Ralph\r\nand Robert Maclay. Rev. A. A. Stapleton, D. D., delivered the principal\r\naddress. Other speakers included Frank L. Dersham, then the\r\nRepresentative in the General Assembly from Union County, who introduced\r\nthe bill for this memorial; Alfred Hayes, now deceased, also a former\r\nmember of the Assembly, who represented the Union County Historical\r\nSociety; Captain Samuel R. Maclay, of Mineral Point, Mo., a grandson of\r\nSenator Samuel Maclay.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Governor Robert Murphy attended the ceremony, as did many\r\ndistinguished citizens from this and other States, school children and\r\nmilitary, civic, historical and patriotic societies. There were\r\nthirty-five representatives of the Maclay family in attendance.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the strangest emotion during the preparation of this shaft and\r\nits unveiling was caused by the seeming lack of knowledge of this\r\nstatesman, farmer, frontiersman, soldier, surveyor, citizen, who was an\r\nofficer in the Continental Army during the Revolution, who was a\r\nforemost actor in the actual development of the interior of the State to\r\ncommerce, one who sat in the highest legislative councils of this\r\nCommonwealth and presided over its Senate, who represented his State in\r\nCongress and later in the United States Senate, and so serving was the\r\ncompeer of men whose names are radiant with luster on the pages of\r\nAmerican history.\r\n\r\nYet, strange to say, the memory of this man had so completely faded from\r\npublic view that college professors, members of the General Assembly and\r\nmen who held some claim to be styled historians asked in wonder, when\r\nthe bill was before the Legislature, “Who was this man?”\r\n\r\nThe ancestors of Senator Maclay came from Scotland, where the clan\r\nMaclay inhabited the mountains of County Boss in the northlands.\r\n\r\nWhen the darkest chapter of Scotch-Irish history was written in tears\r\nand blood, emigration was the only alternative to starvation, and among\r\nthe 30,000 exiles who left for these shores were two Maclays.\r\n\r\nThese two exiles were sons of Charles Maclay, of County Antrim and\r\ntitular Baron of Finga. Their names were Charles, born in 1703, and\r\nJohn, born in 1707. They set sail for America May 30, 1734.\r\n\r\nUpon arrival they first settled in Chester County, Pennsylvania, where\r\nthey remained nearly seven years, when they removed to what is now\r\nLurgan Township, Franklin County, on an estate, which is still in\r\npossession of their descendants.\r\n\r\nHere John, son of Charles, the immigrant, built a mill in 1755, which,\r\nwith modern improvements and alterations, is still operated by the third\r\nsucceeding generation. This mill was stockaded during the French and\r\nIndian War, as it was located on the well-traveled highway leading from\r\nMcAllister’s Gap to Shippensburg.\r\n\r\nDuring the Revolution every male member of the Maclay family, of\r\nmilitary age, was in the service, and every one an officer.\r\n\r\nJohn Maclay, the younger of the immigrant brothers, married Jane\r\nMacDonald in 1747. To this union were born three sons and one daughter;\r\nJohn born 1748, a soldier of the Revolution, died 1800; Charles, born\r\n1750, a captain in the Continental Army, who fell in the action at\r\nCrooked Billet, 1778; Samuel, born 1751, also an officer, fell at Bunker\r\nHill; Elizabeth, wife of Colonel Samuel Culbertson, of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nCharles Maclay, the elder immigrant brother, died in 1753. His wife,\r\nEleanore, whom he had married in Ireland, died in 1789. To them were\r\nborn four sons and one daughter: John, born in Ireland, 1734, for many\r\nyears a magistrate, and in 1776 he was a delegate to convention in\r\nCarpenters’ Hall, Philadelphia. He also served in the General Assembly,\r\n1790–1792 and 1794; William, born in Chester County, July 20, 1737,\r\nwhose sketch appears in another story; Charles, also born in Chester\r\nCounty, in 1739, was a soldier of the Revolution, died in 1834 at\r\nMaclays Mills; Samuel, the subject of our sketch, was born June 17,\r\n1741.\r\n\r\nSamuel Maclay was educated in the classical school conducted by Dr. J.\r\nAllison, of Middle Spring. He also mastered the science of surveying,\r\nwhich he followed for years. In 1769 he was engaged with his brother\r\nWilliam and Surveyor General Lukens in surveying the officers’ tracts on\r\nthe West Branch of the Susquehanna, which had been awarded to the\r\nofficers of First Battalion in Bouquet’s expedition.\r\n\r\nA coincident fact is that the remains of this distinguished patriot lie\r\nburied on the allotment awarded Captain John Brady, who drew the third\r\nchoice, and which was surveyed for him by Maclay.\r\n\r\nSamuel Maclay, November 10, 1773, married Elizabeth, daughter of Colonel\r\nWilliam Plunket, then President Judge of Northumberland County, and\r\ncommandant of the garrison at Fort Augusta. They took up their residence\r\non the Brady tract in Buffalo Valley. To this union six sons and three\r\ndaughters were born.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment Samuel Maclay became a resident of what is now Union\r\nCounty until his death he was identified with the important history of\r\nthe valley.\r\n\r\nSamuel Maclay was one of the commissioners to survey the headwaters of\r\nthe Schuylkill, Susquehanna and Allegheny Rivers. The others were\r\nTimothy Matlack, of Philadelphia, and John Adlum, of York. They were\r\ncommissioned April 9, 1789. These eminent men were skilled\r\nhydrographical and topographical engineers and completed the first great\r\nsurvey of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe journal kept by Maclay is interesting and valuable and relates many\r\nthrilling experiences quite foreign to those of present-day surveyors.\r\n\r\nHe was lieutenant colonel of the First Battalion, Northumberland County\r\nMilitia, organized at Derr’s Mills, now Lewisburg, September 12, 1775.\r\n\r\nIn 1787 Samuel Maclay was elected to Pennsylvania Assembly and served\r\nuntil 1791, when he became Associate Justice of Northumberland County.\r\nIn 1794 he was elected to Congress. Three years later he was elected to\r\nPennsylvania Senate, where he served six years. He was elected Speaker\r\nin 1802 and he served in this capacity until March 16, 1802, when he\r\ntook his seat in the United States Senate, where he continued until\r\nJanuary 4, 1809, resigning on account of broken health.\r\n\r\nHe died October 5, 1811, at the age of seventy years. His wife,\r\nElizabeth Plunket Maclay, survived her distinguished husband until 1835.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Amusing and Memorable “Battle of the\r\n                         Kegs,” January 5, 1778\r\n\r\n\r\nIn January, 1778, while the British were in possession of Philadelphia,\r\nsome Americans had formed a project of sending down by the ebb tide a\r\nnumber of kegs, or machines that resembled kegs as they were floating,\r\ncharged with gunpowder and furnished with machinery, so constructed that\r\non the least touch of anything obstructing their free passage they would\r\nimmediately explode with great force.\r\n\r\nThe plan was to injure the British shipping, which lay at anchor\r\nopposite the city in such great numbers that the kegs could not pass\r\nwithout encountering some of them. But on January 4, the very evening in\r\nwhich these kegs were sent down, the first hard frost came on and the\r\nvessels were hauled into the docks to avoid the ice which was forming,\r\nand the entire scheme failed.\r\n\r\nOne of the kegs, however, happened to explode near the town. This gave a\r\ngeneral alarm in the city, and soon the wharves were filled with troops,\r\nand the greater part of the following day was spent in firing at every\r\nchip or stick that was seen floating in the river. The kegs were under\r\nwater, nothing appearing on the surface but a small buoy.\r\n\r\nThis circumstance gave occasion for many stories of this incident to be\r\npublished in the papers of that day. The following account is taken from\r\na letter dated Philadelphia, January 9, 1778:\r\n\r\n“This city hath lately been entertained with a most astonishing instance\r\nof activity, bravery and military skill of the royal army and navy of\r\nGreat Britain. The affair is somewhat particular and deserves your\r\nnotice. Some time last week a keg of singular construction was observed\r\nfloating in the river. The crew of a barge attempting to take it up, it\r\nsuddenly exploded, killed four of the hands and wounded the rest.\r\n\r\n“On Monday last some of the kegs of a singular construction made their\r\nappearance. The alarm was immediately given. Various reports prevailed\r\nin the city, filling the royal troops with unspeakable consternation.\r\nSome asserted that these kegs were filled with rebels, who were to issue\r\nforth in the dead of night, as the Grecians did of old from the wooden\r\nhorse at the siege of Troy, and take the city by surprise. Some declared\r\nthey had seen the points of bayonets sticking out of the bung-holes of\r\nthe kegs. Others said they were filled with inflammable combustibles\r\nwhich would set the Delaware in flames and consume all the shipping in\r\nthe harbor. Others conjectured that they were machines constructed by\r\nart magic and expected to see them mount the wharves and roll, all\r\nflaming with infernal fire, through the streets of the city.\r\n\r\n“I say nothing as to these reports and apprehensions, but certain it is,\r\nthe ships of war were immediately manned and the wharves crowded with\r\nchosen men. Hostilities were commenced without much ceremony and it was\r\nsurprising to behold the incessant firing that was poured upon the\r\nenemy’s kegs. Both officers and men exhibited unparalleled skill and\r\nprowess on the occasion, whilst the citizens stood gaping as solemn\r\nwitnesses of this dreadful scene.\r\n\r\n“In truth, not a chip, stick or drift log passed by without experiencing\r\nthe vigor of the British arms. The action began about sunrise and would\r\nhave terminated in favor of the British by noon had not an old market\r\nwoman, in crossing the river with provisions, unfortunately let a keg of\r\nbutter fall overboard, which as it was then ebb tide, floated down to\r\nthe scene of battle. At sight of this unexpected re-enforcement of the\r\nenemy the attack was renewed with fresh forces, and the firing from the\r\nmarine and land troops was beyond imagination and so continued until\r\nnight closed the conflict.\r\n\r\n“The rebel kegs were either totally demolished or obliged to fly, as\r\nnone of them have shown their heads since. It is said that His\r\nExcellency, Lord Howe, has dispatched a swift sailing packet with an\r\naccount of this signal victory to the Court of London. In short, Monday,\r\nJanuary 5, 1778, will be memorable in history for the renowned battle of\r\nthe kegs.”\r\n\r\nThe entire transaction was laughable in the extreme and furnished the\r\ntheme for unnumbered sallies of wit from the Whig press, while the\r\ndistinguished author of “Hail Columbia,” Joseph H. Hopkinson,\r\nparaphrased it in a ballad which was immensely popular at the time.\r\n\r\nThis ballad is worthy of reproduction and is given almost in full:\r\n\r\n                         THE BATTLE OF THE KEGS\r\n                         By JOSEPH H.

They were also accompanied on\r\nthe voyage by the Reverend John Martin Mack and the Reverend David\r\nZeisberger, the latter also an interpreter, and each of these figured\r\nvery prominently in the early history among the Indians of the great\r\nSusquehanna Valleys.\r\n\r\nCammerhoff was born near Magdeburg, Germany, July 28, 1721; died at\r\nBethlehem, Pa., April 28, 1751. He was educated at Jena and at the age\r\nof twenty-five was consecrated Bishop in London and came to America.\r\n\r\nHis greatest success was among the Indians of Pennsylvania and New York.\r\nThe Iroquois adopted him into the Turtle Tribe of the Oneida Nation, and\r\ngave him the name of Gallichwio or “A Good Message.”\r\n\r\nAccompanied only by Joseph Powell, he set out from Bethlehem for\r\nShamokin on the afternoon of January 6, 1748, and reached Macungy, now\r\nEmaus, by night. The next day they traveled through deep snow, sleeping\r\nthat night at the home of Moses Starr, a Quaker. Early next morning the\r\nSchuylkill was reached, which was partly frozen over. A crossing was\r\neffected with great risk over the thin ice, leading their horses, which\r\nbroke through and nearly drowned. They passed through Heidelberg, Berks\r\nCounty, and reached Tulpehocken, where they slept at Michael\r\nSchaeffer’s.\r\n\r\nNext morning they arrived at George Loesch’s and here determined to\r\nleave the mountain road via the Great Swatara Gap and Mahanoy Mountains,\r\nand to travel along the Indian path leading from Harris’ Ferry, which\r\nthey were to meet at the river.\r\n\r\nThey got as far as Henry Zender’s, where they spent the night, and next\r\nmorning set out for Harris’ Ferry, a long day’s journey along the Great\r\nSwatara, which they reached at noon. Seven miles from Harris’ they got\r\nlost in the woods, but the missionaries arrived at Harris’ at 7 o’clock\r\nand found there a great company of traders.\r\n\r\nNext morning, January 11, they proceeded toward Shamokin, following the\r\npath made by some Indians who the previous day had traveled from\r\nShamokin to Harris’ Ferry. They passed by Chambers’ Mill, at the mouth\r\nof Fishing Creek, seven miles above the ferry. They proceeded, after a\r\nsumptuous noonday meal, and in a few hours struck the base of the\r\nmountain, which marked the northern limit of Proprietaries’ land. They\r\npassed over Peter’s Mountain, then forded Powell’s Creek, and,\r\ncompletely exhausted, arrived at Armstrong’s house, which was at the\r\nmouth of the present Armstrong Creek, above Halifax.\r\n\r\nIn spite of a hard storm during the night they pressed on the next day\r\nand nearly lost their lives crossing Manhantango Creek, which was very\r\nhigh, reached the house of Captain Thomas McKee and passed the night.\r\n\r\nAt 3 o’clock next day they reached Mahanoy Creek, which they forded at a\r\nplace McKee had advised, and night overtook them five miles from their\r\ndestination, but in the moonlight they pressed on, and descending the\r\nsteep hills they encountered a miraculous escape, and again at Shamokin\r\nCreek were carried nearly 100 yards down stream by the raging current.\r\nHere Missionary Mack and others, anticipating their approach, met them\r\nat 9 o’clock at night and cheered them on the last two miles of their\r\nlong and tedious trip. They arrived at Shamokin (now Sunbury) at\r\ndaybreak on Sunday, January 14.\r\n\r\nShikellamy went to see Cammerhoff and expressed his regret that he had\r\nsuch a fatiguing journey, and during his stay at that great Indian\r\ncapital showed him every attention.\r\n\r\nFollowing the great conference at Philadelphia, in August, 1749, it\r\nbecame necessary the next spring for the Moravian missionaries to visit\r\nthe Great Council of the Six Nations at Onondaga.\r\n\r\nIt was arranged that the Rev. David Zeisberger, who was then at\r\nShamokin, should join Bishop Cammerhoff at Wyoming and accompany him on\r\nthis journey. The latter, having obtained a passport from Governor\r\nHamilton, set out from Bethlehem on May 14, accompanied by John Martin\r\nMark, Timothy Horsfield and Gottlieb Bezold. They journeyed on foot up\r\nthe Lehigh to Gnadenhutten, then over the mountains to Wyoming, where\r\nthey arrived May 20, 1750, and “at once went to Nanticoke town; there\r\nthey were kindly welcomed, and where they awaited the Indian who was to\r\nguide them.”\r\n\r\nWhen the Cayuga chief arrived, accompanied by his wife, his son, aged\r\nfourteen, and his daughter, aged four years, they departed in canoes on\r\nthe afternoon of May 28. “David and I, with the boy and girl, set out in\r\nour canoe and the Cayuga and his wife in their hunting skiff,” records\r\nCammerhoff.\r\n\r\nOn June 6, they passed Wyalusing Falls, and then came to Gahontoto, the\r\nsite of an ancient Indian city where a peculiar nation once lived.\r\nTraces of their former Indian city were discernible in the old ruined\r\ncorn fields. The Cayuga chief told the Bishop that the Five Nations had\r\nfought and exterminated the inhabitants of this city long before they\r\nfought with guns.\r\n\r\nThey proceeded up the Susquehanna and then into the Tioga or Chemung\r\nRiver, and disembarked at Gandtscherat, a Cayuga village near Waverly,\r\nN. Y. Thence they traveled overland by way of Cayuga to Onondaga, where\r\nthey arrived June 21, the very day the big council was to convene, but\r\nits actual assembly was delayed because a majority of the Indians got\r\ndrunk.\r\n\r\nWhen the council finally met at Onondaga, the design of the proposed\r\nnegotiations, as made known to the visitors, was that emissaries of the\r\nFrench were endeavoring to entice the Six Nations from their compact\r\nwith the English.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the conference, Cammerhoff presented to the Council\r\na petition from the Nanticoke Indians at Wyoming, to the effect that\r\nthey might have a blacksmith shop, under Moravian auspices, set up in\r\ntheir village. This request was denied by the Council, and the\r\nNanticokes informed that they could avail themselves of the services of\r\nthe blacksmith at Shamokin. This smith was Anthony Schmidt, who was sent\r\nto Shamokin from the Moravian Mission at Bethlehem. He arrived there\r\nAugust 3, 1747, accompanied by his wife. He remained there many years\r\nand performed his task to the general satisfaction of the Indians who\r\ntraveled 100 or more miles to have a gun barrel straightened or the\r\nfirelock repaired.\r\n\r\nTheir business at Onondaga being finished, Cammerhoff and Zeisberger\r\njourneyed overland to the Susquehanna, where they embarked in a canoe\r\nand floated down the river as far as the village of the Nanticoke, which\r\nthey reached Sunday, August 2, 1750. They tarried only a day and then\r\nproceeded to Shamokin, where they arrived August 6, having traveled more\r\nthan 600 miles on horseback, afoot and in canoes.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Bank of North America, First Incorporated\r\n                  Bank in the United States, Commenced\r\n                        Business January 7, 1782\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first incorporated bank in America was the Bank of North America,\r\nand its operations commenced January 7, 1782, in the commodious store\r\nbelonging to its cashier, Tench Francis, on the north side of Chestnut\r\nStreet, west of Third.\r\n\r\nIn 1780 the Assembly of Pennsylvania made a strong effort to relieve the\r\npeople from the withering blight of the Continental money. It tried to\r\nredeem it by taxation at the rate of 1 to 40. But neither this nor any\r\nother measure prevented the coinage of the phrase, “It is not worth a\r\nContinental.”\r\n\r\nTo assist Congress in providing for the army, Robert Morris and other\r\nfinanciers of the State established the Bank of Pennsylvania, the first\r\nbank in America. The last attempt to prolong the life of the\r\n“Continentals” was made by the Supreme Executive Council in May, 1781;\r\nbut the remedy proved fatal. Pelatiah Webster said of the proceedings:\r\n“Thus fell, ended and died the Continental currency, aged six years.”\r\n\r\nDuring the Revolutionary War the country was extremely poor, with few\r\nindustries but agriculture, and was quite denuded of the precious\r\nmetals, owing to a heavy and long continued adverse foreign trade, so\r\nthat the Congress of the United States experienced great difficulties in\r\nproviding the requisite means for carrying on the hostilities.\r\n\r\nOn May 10, 1775, soon after the battle of Lexington, Congress made\r\npreparation to issue Continental paper, $2,000,000 of which were put in\r\ncirculation on June 22 following.\r\n\r\nFrom month to month these issues, which in the aggregate reached three\r\nhundred millions, depreciated, until eventually they became entirely\r\nvalueless, notwithstanding the passage of laws making them a legal\r\ntender for the payment of debts.\r\n\r\nOn May 17, 1781, a plan for a National Bank was submitted to Congress by\r\nRobert Morris, of Pennsylvania, the principal provisions of which were\r\nas follows: The capital to be $400,000, in shares of $400 each; that\r\neach share be entitled to a vote for directors; that there be twelve\r\ndirectors chosen from those entitled to vote, who at their first meeting\r\nshall choose one as president; that the directors meet quarterly; that\r\nthe board be empowered from time to time to open new subscriptions for\r\nthe purpose of increasing the capital of the bank; statements to be made\r\nto the Superintendent of the Finances of America; that the bank notes\r\npayable on demand shall by law be made receivable for duties and taxes\r\nin any state, and from the respective states by the treasury of the\r\nUnited States; that the Superintendent of Finances of America shall have\r\na right at all times to examine into the affairs of the bank.\r\n\r\nOn May 26, 1781, Congress adopted the following: “Resolved, that\r\nCongress do approve of the plan for the establishment of a National Bank\r\nin these United States, submitted for their consideration by Mr. R.\r\nMorris, May 17, 1781, and that they will promote and support the same by\r\nsuch ways and means, from time to time, as may appear necessary for the\r\ninstitution and consistent with the public good; that the subscribers to\r\nthe said bank shall be incorporated agreeably to the principles and\r\nterms of the plan, under the name of ‘The President, Directors, and\r\nCompany of the Bank of North America,’ so soon as the subscription shall\r\nbe filled, the directors and president chosen, and application for that\r\npurpose made to Congress by the president and directors elected.”\r\n\r\nOn December 31 following Congress adopted “an ordinance to incorporate\r\nthe subscribers to the Bank of North America.”\r\n\r\nThe first president was Thomas Willing, and the cashier was Tench\r\nFrancis. The bank became at once a most important auxiliary in aid of\r\nthe finances of the government, and so continued to the end of the war.\r\n\r\nThis institution was also incorporated by the State of Pennsylvania, on\r\nApril 18, 1782.\r\n\r\nRobert Morris subscribed for 633 shares of the bank on account of the\r\nUnited States, paying therefore $254,000, but, owing to the necessities\r\nof the government, he was almost immediately compelled to borrow a like\r\namount from the bank, so that the institution derived but little benefit\r\nfrom the government subscription.\r\n\r\nThe deposits gradually assumed large proportions. Some of the States\r\ngave to the bank the assistance of their recognition. Connecticut made\r\nthe notes receivable in payment of taxes, Rhode Island provided\r\npunishment for counterfeiting its issue, and Massachusetts created it a\r\ncorporation according to the laws of that Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the bank were almost immediately attended with the\r\nrestoration of confidence and credit. The State of Pennsylvania being\r\nunable to pay the officers of its army, relief was found in the bank,\r\nwhich advanced the money for the state, and received its reimbursement\r\nwhen the revenue was collected.\r\n\r\nThe public enemy infested the Delaware River and Bay, and seized vessels\r\nin the port of Philadelphia. The bank advanced $22,500, which enabled\r\nthe merchants to fit out a ship of war, which not only cleared the river\r\nof the enemy, but captured a cruiser of twenty guns belonging to the\r\nBritish fleet.\r\n\r\nThe defense of the Western frontier was promoted by the advance of £5000\r\nby the bank in 1782.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1785, when an ill feeling had arisen between the government\r\nof the State of Pennsylvania and the bank, the former repealed the\r\ncharter which it had granted in 1782. The bank, however, continued its\r\noperations under the charter granted by the Federal Government till\r\n1787, when it was rechartered by Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe charter of the Bank of North America has been renewed from time to\r\ntime, and was made a National Bank, December, 1864, and is still one of\r\nthe leading financial institutions of the State and Nation.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the only three banks in existence at the time of the\r\nadoption of the Federal Constitution, the others being the Bank of New\r\nYork, at New York City, and the Bank of Massachusetts, at Boston.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Matthias Baldwin Completed First Successful\r\n                       Locomotive January 8, 1831\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first successful American locomotive was made in Philadelphia by\r\nMatthias William Baldwin, and completed January 8, 1831.\r\n\r\nThe story of the man and his wonderful achievement is the story of one\r\nof the greatest industrial plans in the world and is full of human\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nMatthias Baldwin was born December 10, 1795, the son of an Elizabeth, N.\r\nJ., carriage-maker, who was in affluent circumstances at the time of his\r\ndeath, but the mismanagement of his property caused the loss of nearly\r\nall. Matthias was the youngest of five children and but four years old\r\nwhen his father died. He inherited his father’s skill with tools and\r\nearly began to construct labor-saving devices to assist his mother in\r\nher housework.\r\n\r\nAt the age of sixteen he was apprenticed to a firm of jewelers in\r\nFrankford, now a part of Philadelphia. His habits were sober,\r\nindustrious and earnest. He devoted much of his spare time to singing in\r\nthe little Presbyterian Church.\r\n\r\nAt twenty-one he became an apprentice in the firm of Fletcher & Gardner,\r\nsilversmiths and jewelers, of Chestnut Street, Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nIn 1825 he formed a partnership with David Mason, a machinist, for the\r\nmanufacture of bookbinder tools and cylinders for calico printing. Their\r\nfirst shop was in a small alley running north from Walnut Street above\r\nFourth. Afterwards they moved into a shop on Minor Street, where they\r\nalso began to manufacture machines of Mr. Baldwin’s invention.\r\n\r\nThe first such invention was a small upright engine adapted to the\r\nmotive power of a small factory. From this success the manufacture of\r\nstationary steam engines took a prominent place in the establishment.\r\n\r\nThe plant now employed a number of young men. Baldwin felt that these\r\nneeded some place where they could get instruction in science and\r\nmechanical art, so that they might become more intelligent and\r\ninventive. He talked over the matter with many other employers, and the\r\nresult was the founding of Franklin Institute, the cornerstone of which\r\nwas laid with Masonic ceremonies, June 8, 1824. This is still one of the\r\nactive and valuable institutions of the country.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Mr. Mason withdrew from the firm, Mr. Baldwin continuing\r\nthe manufacture of engines.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1829–30 that steam, as a motive power on railroads, began to\r\nattract the attention of American engineers. George Stephenson had\r\nproduced a successful locomotive in England. In 1830 the Camden and\r\nAmboy Railroad Company brought across the ocean a locomotive, which was\r\nkept hidden from the public eye until it should be used.\r\n\r\nFranklin Peale, who owned the Philadelphia Museum, where up-to-date\r\nnovelties were shown, wished to have a small working model of a\r\nlocomotive to exhibit, and he turned to Matthias Baldwin.\r\n\r\nThe two men found out where the locomotive was kept, and visited the\r\nplace. Baldwin was already familiar with the published description and\r\nsketches of engines which had taken part in the Rainhill competitions in\r\nEngland, but he now had an opportunity to see and measure for himself an\r\nactual engine.\r\n\r\nBaldwin made the model, completing it January 8, 1831. It was taken to\r\nthe museum and on April 25 was put in motion on a circular track made of\r\npine boards, covered with hoop-iron. It drew two small cars, each\r\nholding four persons, and attracted great attention from the crowds who\r\nsaw it. Both anthracite and pine-knot coal were used as fuel, and the\r\nsteam was discharged through the smokestack to increase the draught.\r\n\r\nThe success of the model obtained for Mr. Baldwin an order for a\r\nlocomotive for the Philadelphia, Germantown and Norristown Railroad\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\nThis engine when completed was called “Old Ironsides” and left the shop\r\nNovember 23, 1832. It stood on the rails like a “thing of life.” Its\r\nlight weight, between four and five tons, did not give it that tractive\r\npower necessary to draw a loaded train on wet and slippery rails, hence\r\nthe newspapers of that day termed it a “fair weather” locomotive,\r\nbecause the notices specified that “the locomotive built by Mr. M. W.\r\nBaldwin, of this city, will depart daily, when the weather is fair, with\r\na train of passenger cars. On rainy days horses will be attached.”\r\n\r\nThe “Old Ironsides” was a four-wheeled engine, modeled essentially on\r\nthe English fashion of that day. The wheels were made with heavy\r\ncast-iron hubs, wooden spokes and rims, and wrought-iron tires. The\r\nprice of this engine was $4,000, but the company claimed that it did not\r\nperform according to contract, and after correction had been made as far\r\nas possible, a compromise was effected and Mr. Baldwin received $3,500\r\nfor his work.\r\n\r\n“Old Ironsides” on subsequent trials attained a speed of thirty miles an\r\nhour with the usual train.\r\n\r\nOnly one man in Baldwin’s shop, besides the inventor himself, could\r\nproperly run “Old Ironsides.” This man fell sick, and others who tried,\r\ncould not get it to run satisfactorily. The president of the road was\r\nabout to throw it back on Baldwin’s hands when the engineer recovered\r\nand the locomotive gave satisfaction. But Baldwin was so thoroughly\r\ndisgusted with all the complaints, and such was his first locomotive\r\nthat he said with much decision, “That is our last locomotive.” But\r\nother great men have been known to change their minds, and when Matthias\r\nBaldwin died, his works had built more than 1500 locomotives.\r\n\r\n“The Miller,” for the Charleston and Hamburg, S. C., Railroad Company\r\nwas the next engine built by Mr. Baldwin. During 1834 he completed five\r\nlocomotives, and his business was now fairly established. It was during\r\nthis year that larger quarters were necessary, and Mr. Baldwin removed\r\nhis shops to the location on Broad and Hamilton Streets, where, in 1835,\r\nthe present Baldwin Locomotive Works had their origin, and where they\r\nhave since developed into their immense proportions.\r\n\r\nThe financial difficulties of 1836–37 did not leave Mr. Baldwin\r\nunscathed. Great as his embarrassments were a full consultation with his\r\ncreditors resulted in the wise determination to leave him in full and\r\ncomplete possession of the plant and business, under an agreement to pay\r\nfull amount of indebtedness, principal and interest. In five years\r\nBaldwin discharged every dollar of debt.\r\n\r\nAugust 25, 1842, Mr. Baldwin obtained a patent for a six-wheel connected\r\nengine, which revived the business. In 1840 Baldwin built a locomotive\r\nfor Austria and in 1845 he built three for Wurtemburg.\r\n\r\nMr. Baldwin died September 7, 1865, after he had virtually perfected the\r\nlocomotive and witnessed the rise and wonderful increase of the most\r\nimportant material interest of the age, to the completion of which he\r\nhad contributed more than any other individual. His name was familiar\r\nwhere the locomotive was known and his personal character as a Christian\r\nand a philanthropist was as highly esteemed by his associates and\r\nacquaintances as his scientific achievements were valued by the\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Fort Hunter, an Important Defense,\r\n                       Garrisoned January 9, 1756\r\n\r\n\r\nA motorist touring north along the Susquehanna Trail, when six miles\r\nabove Harrisburg, just at the point in the roadway where one would turn\r\noff sharply to the right, if going to the beautiful Country Club of\r\nHarrisburg, can see a boulder which marks the site of Fort Hunter, one\r\nof the busy places during the stirring period immediately following\r\nhostilities which inaugurated the French and Indian War.\r\n\r\nThis fort stood on the south bank of Fishing Creek, at its junction with\r\nthe Susquehanna River, on property now occupied by John W. Reily near\r\nthe village known as Rockville.\r\n\r\nThe date of its erection is uncertain, but it is probable that it was\r\nbuilt by the settlers about October, 1755, immediately after the two\r\nterrible Indian massacres at Penn’s Creek and Mahanoy Creek. It was\r\ncompleted by the Provincial Government in January, 1756.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Chambers was the first white man to settle in that vicinity,\r\nwhere he built a mill in 1720. He was the senior of four brothers, all\r\nsturdy Presbyterians from the County of Antrim in the north of Ireland.\r\nHe was subsequently joined by his three brothers, and in 1735 all but\r\nThomas removed to the Cumberland Valley.\r\n\r\nBenjamin erected Fort Chambers and became a most influential citizen.\r\nThomas remained on Fishing Creek and operated a mill. His son-in-law,\r\nRobert Hunter, subsequently fell heir to the improvements and henceforth\r\nthe stockade was known as the fort at Hunter’s Mill, or Fort Hunter.\r\n\r\nThe first orders on record relating to Fort Hunter were issued January\r\n9, 1756, by Governor Morris to Adam Read, of Hanover Township, Lancaster\r\nCounty, and were as follows:\r\n\r\n“The Commissioner thinking that a company of fifty men under your\r\ncommand are sufficient to guard the frontier along the Kittektiny Hills,\r\nfrom your own house to Hunter’s Mill, have refused for the present to\r\ntake any other men in that quarter into the pay of the Government, and\r\nrequested me to order, and I do hereby order you to detach twenty-five\r\nof the men now at your house, to the fort at Hunter’s Mill, upon\r\nSusquehanna, under the command of your lieutenant, or officer next under\r\nyourself, or in case there be none such appointed by the Government,\r\nthen under the command of such person as you shall appoint for that\r\nservice; and you are to give orders to the commander of such detachment\r\nto keep his men in order and fit for duty, and to cause a party of them,\r\nfrom time to time, to range the woods along and near the mountains\r\ntoward your house; and you are in like manner to keep the men with you\r\nin good order, and to cause a party of them from time to time, to range\r\nthe woods on or near the mountains toward Hunter’s Mill, and you and\r\nthey are to continue upon this service till further order.\r\n\r\n“You are to add ten men to your company out of the township of Paxton,\r\nand to make the detachment at Hunter’s Mill of twenty more men, which\r\nwith those ten, are to complete thirty for service, and keep an account\r\nof the time when these ten enter themselves, that you may be enabled to\r\nmake up your muster roll upon oath.”\r\n\r\nHardly had the above order been executed and the men recruited until\r\nadditional orders were dispatched by the Governor to Captain Read: “I\r\nhave also appointed Thomas McKee to take post at or near Hunter’s Mill\r\nwith thirty men.”\r\n\r\nAn interesting sentence in his letter revealed the hardships of a\r\nProvincial soldier: “But as the Province is at present in want of arms\r\nand blankets, if any of the men you shall enlist will find themselves\r\nwith those articles, they shall receive half a dollar for the use of\r\ntheir gun, and half a dollar for the use of a blanket.”\r\n\r\nAt the same time Governor Morris wrote to James Galbraith, Esq., a\r\nProvincial Commissioner, rehearsing the sundry orders given to Captains\r\nRead and McKee, to which he added:\r\n\r\n“I have also instructed Capt. McKee to advise with you whether to finish\r\nthe fort already begun at Hunter’s Mill, or to build a new one, and as\r\nto the place where it would be best to erect such new one. I therefore\r\ndesire you will assist him in those matters, or in anything else that\r\nthe King’s service and the safety of the inhabitants may require.”\r\n\r\nOn December 9, 1755, Thomas Foster and Thomas McKee were furnished with\r\n“12½ pounds powder and 25 pounds swan shot.” It is therefore more than\r\nprobable the soldiers ordered there in January, 1756, by Governor Morris\r\nwere the first Provincial soldiers put on duty at Fort Hunter.\r\n\r\nThe activity of the French, in their efforts to enlist the Indians of\r\nthe Province to take up the hatchet against the English, was felt at\r\nthis post, as letters written by Captain McKee to Edward Shippen and\r\nothers reveal.\r\n\r\nAt this time the Province had decided to erect a great fortress at the\r\nforks of the Susquehanna, which was subsequently built and named Fort\r\nAugusta. Colonel William Clapham was commissioned early in April, 1756,\r\nto recruit a regiment of 400 men for this purpose.\r\n\r\nGovernor Morris advised Colonel Clapham, April 7, that he had directed a\r\nrendezvous to be established at Fort Hunter and advised the colonel to\r\nuse it for the safe storage of supplies and stocks which he would\r\nrequire in his expedition farther up the river.\r\n\r\nJune 11, 1756, Colonel Clapham stationed twenty-four troops there, under\r\ncommand of a Mr. Johnson, and directed him to “escort provisions, from\r\nthere to McKee’s store.” November 3 the garrison consisted of “2\r\nsargants and 34 Private Men.”\r\n\r\nMarch 14, 1757, at a conference on the defense of the Province, held at\r\nPhiladelphia, it was decided that 400 men should be kept at Fort\r\nAugusta; 100 should constitute the garrison at Fort Halifax, and that\r\nFort Hunter should be demolished, only fifty being retained there\r\ntemporarily until the removal of the magazine which was to take place as\r\nsoon as possible.\r\n\r\nThe long frontier of the Blue Mountain, between the Susquehanna and\r\nDelaware was to be defended by Colonel Conrad Weiser’s battalion, and\r\nthe forts reduced to three in number.\r\n\r\nThis caused consternation among the settlers near Fort Hunter and they\r\nappealed to the Provincial authorities.\r\n\r\nCommissary Young, the Reverend John Elder and others appeared in person\r\nAugust 25 in Philadelphia, and strongly urged the retention of the\r\ngarrison at this important place. Their appeal was effective. Fort\r\nHunter was not demolished but strengthened.\r\n\r\nIndians appeared within twenty rods of Fort Hunter, October, 1757.\r\nWilliam Martin was killed and scalped while picking chestnuts.\r\n\r\nColonel James Patterson was in command of the garrison in January, 1758.\r\nFrom that time until the Pontiac Conspiracy in 1763, there was not much\r\nactivity about Fort Hunter, when it again became the rendezvous of\r\nProvincial troops. After peace was declared Fort Hunter slowly but\r\nsurely passed out of existence until the last log was rotted and\r\ndisappeared and the old fort only existed as an historical memory.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Founder of Stumpstown Murdered Ten\r\n                       Indians, January 10, 1768\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout a dozen years ago the members of the Lebanon County Historical\r\nSociety enjoyed three evenings of entertainment when that able and\r\nclever historian, Dr. E. Grumbine, of Mt. Zion, gave a history of\r\ninteresting events, traditions and anecdotes of early Fredericksburg,\r\nknown for many years as Stumpstown.\r\n\r\nThe village was laid out in 1761 by Frederick Stump, who for years\r\nafterwards led a most unusual and exciting life. The town was then in\r\nLancaster County, later in Dauphin, then after 1813 in Lebanon County.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1826 a postoffice was established in the place, which with\r\neminent propriety received the name Stumpstown. In 1843 the name of the\r\npostoffice became Fredericksburg.\r\n\r\nIn 1828 two enterprising citizens, named Henry and Martin Meily, built a\r\ncanal boat, as the Union Canal had recently been opened and the canal\r\nwas the talk of the day. While Stumpstown was distant from the canal,\r\nthe Meilys did not seem to care for this handicap, but using a vacant\r\ncorner of the only graveyard in the village, they constructed their boat\r\nand when finished they loaded it on heavy wagons and conveyed it four\r\nmiles overland to Jonestown, where they christened it “Columbus” and\r\nlaunched it on the raging canal. It carried freight to and from\r\nPhiladelphia for many years.\r\n\r\nIn 1767 the German Lutherans erected a church of logs, which served its\r\npurpose for sixty years.\r\n\r\nLike many places, Stumpstown had a big fire which destroyed nearly\r\none-fourth of the village. That was in 1827, and was caused by a boy\r\nshooting at a crow perched on the thatched roof of a stable. His old\r\nflint-rock was wadded with tow, which being inflammable, set fire to the\r\nstraw thatch, and soon the barn was in flames, and fanned by a strong\r\nnorthwest breeze, a total of twenty buildings including a tannery,\r\nsheds, dwelling of owner, blacksmith shop, the only school house, and\r\nother houses were consumed.\r\n\r\nFrederick Stump, the founder, was a notorious character. He was born in\r\n1735 in the neighborhood of Stumpstown, and in 1768 was living near the\r\nmouth of Middle Creek in what is now Snyder County.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday morning, January 10, 1768, six Indians went to the house of\r\nFrederick Stump. They were White Mingo, Cornelius, John Campbell, Jones\r\nand two squaws. They were in a drunken condition and behaved in a\r\nsuspicious manner. Stump endeavored to get them to leave, but without\r\nsuccess. Fearing injury to himself, he and his servant, John Ironcutter,\r\nkilled them all, dragging their bodies to the creek, where they cut a\r\nhole in the ice and pushed their bodies into the stream.\r\n\r\nFearing the news might be carried to the other Indians, Stump went the\r\nnext day to their cabins, fourteen miles up the creek, where he found\r\none squaw, two girls and one child. These he killed and threw their\r\nbodies in the cabin and burned it.\r\n\r\nThe details of these murders were told by Stump to William Blythe, who\r\nfound the charred remains of the four in the cabin ruins. Blythe\r\ntestified to these acts before the Provincial authorities in\r\nPhiladelphia, January 19, 1768.\r\n\r\nOne of the bodies which Stump pushed through the hole in the ice floated\r\ndown the Susquehanna until it finally lodged against the shore on the\r\nCumberland County side, opposite Harrisburg, below the site of the\r\npresent bridge at Market Street.\r\n\r\nThe Indian had been killed by being struck on the forehead with some\r\nblunt instrument, which crushed in his skull. His entire scalp,\r\nincluding his ears, was torn from his head. An inquest was held February\r\n28, 1768, at the spot where his body was found.\r\n\r\nJohn Blair Linn, in his “Annals of Buffalo Valley,” places the scene of\r\nthis crime on the run that enters the creek at Middleburgh, known by the\r\nname of Stump’s Run to this day.\r\n\r\nThis crime caused the greatest consternation throughout the Province, as\r\nthe authorities had just cause to fear a repetition of the Indian\r\noutrages unless Stump was apprehended and punished for his crime.\r\n\r\nA few Indians who escaped the wrath of Stump chased him toward Fort\r\nAugusta. Stump did not enter the fort, but rushed into a house occupied\r\nby two women. He claimed their protection, alleging he was pursued by\r\nIndians. They did not believe him, and feared the Indians, if his story\r\nbe true, but he begged piteously they hide him between two beds.\r\n\r\nThe Indians were but a moment behind Stump, but the women insisted they\r\nknew nothing of him. Before the Indians left the house they seized a\r\ncat, plucked out its hair and tore it to pieces, illustrating the\r\nreception which awaited Stump, had they found him.\r\n\r\nCaptain William Patterson led a score of his neighbors to assist in\r\narresting Stump and Ironcutter.\r\n\r\nOn their approach Stump fled to the woods, but Patterson pretended that\r\nhe wanted Stump to accompany him to Great Island to kill Indians. This\r\nappealed to Stump, who returned to the house, when Patterson arrested\r\nand bound him and took him and his servant to Carlisle, where they were\r\nlodged in jail, Saturday evening, March 23, 1768.\r\n\r\nBut justice was to be cheated. The magistrates fought over the place of\r\nStump’s trial, and it was decided to try him in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nOn Monday morning following his arrest, the Sheriff proceeded to do his\r\nduty, but was restrained by the magistrates. On Wednesday, forty of the\r\ncountry people assembled on the outskirts of Carlisle, and sent two\r\nmessengers to the jail. When they learned Stump was not to be sent to\r\nPhiladelphia for trial, they dispersed.\r\n\r\nOn Friday a company from Sherman’s Valley, where Stump had lived,\r\nmarched toward Carlisle, about eight entering the town. Two of them went\r\nto the jail and asked the jailor for liquor. As he was serving them the\r\nothers entered with drawn cutlasses and pistols and demanded he make no\r\noutcry. Sixty others now surrounded the jail. Stump was taken from the\r\ndungeon, the handcuffs removed and he was released.\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff, Colonel John Armstrong and others attempted to restrain the\r\nmob, but in the struggle which ensued Stump escaped, as did his servant,\r\nIroncutter.\r\n\r\nThe Governor was angered at this escape and issued instructions for his\r\nrearrest and then a formal proclamation offering a reward of £200 for\r\nStump and £100 for Ironcutter.\r\n\r\nAfter their rescue from the Carlisle jail both Stump and Ironcutter\r\nreturned to the neighborhood of their bloody crime, but as their\r\npresence was not longer agreeable to the inhabitants, Stump soon left\r\nand went to the residence of his father at Tulpehocken and Ironcutter\r\nwas spirited away by friends.\r\n\r\nThey were never again arrested, for the settlers generally sympathized\r\nwith them, but Stump and his servant both went to Virginia, where it is\r\nknown that Stump died at an advanced age.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               First Records of Courts in State Preserved\r\n                            January 11, 1682\r\n\r\n\r\nNearly a month after the signing of the charter, March 4, 1681, King\r\nCharles II, April 2, issued a declaration informing the inhabitants and\r\nplanters of the Province that William Penn, their absolute Proprietary,\r\nwas clothed with all the powers and pre-eminences necessary for the\r\nGovernment. A few days later, April 8, the Proprietary addressed a\r\nproclamation to the inhabitants of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nCaptain William Markham, a cousin of William Penn, was appointed Deputy\r\nGovernor and his commission contained five items of instructions, the\r\nfourth being “to erect courts, appoint sheriffs, justices of the peace,\r\netc.” These courts were established and the new Government was soon\r\nfunctioning.\r\n\r\nThe records of these early courts are interesting to both the lawyer and\r\nthose who care for the history of our State.\r\n\r\nMost of our citizens are but little attracted by the tedious accounts of\r\nroutine practice, or the fine distinction between one jurisdiction and\r\nanother, yet they find gratification in contemplating the manners,\r\ncustoms and modes of thought once prevalent in our courts of justice.\r\n\r\nA review of the practice of the courts of Pennsylvania in the\r\nseventeenth century and as late as the eighteenth present many\r\ninteresting subjects.\r\n\r\nThe power to erect courts of justice and to appoint all judicial\r\nofficers in and for the Province of Pennsylvania was by the express\r\nterms of the charter conferred upon the Proprietary. But, in deference\r\nto the wishes of the people, Penn was willing to forego to some degree\r\nthe exercise of this extraordinary right and the concurrence of the\r\nAssembly was invariably required to the bill for the erection of a\r\ncourt. The judges during the early years of the Province were also\r\nselected by the Provincial Council, the members of which were elected\r\nannually by the people in accordance with provisions of the Frame of\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe County Courts of the Province had their origin in 1673, under the\r\nGovernment of James, Duke of York, and were established in every county,\r\n“to decide all matters under twenty pounds without appeal,” and to have\r\nexclusive jurisdiction in the administration of criminal justice, with\r\nan appeal, however, in cases extending to “Life, Limbo and Banishment,”\r\nto the Court of Assizes in New York. These courts usually consisted of\r\nfive or six justices, which met quarterly. No one learned in the law\r\npresided on the bench, no attorney was allowed to practice for pay.\r\nJuries were only allowed to consist of six or seven men, except in cases\r\nof life and death, and in all save those instances, the conclusions of\r\nthe majority were allowed to prevail.\r\n\r\nThe first court held in the Province, the records of which are\r\npreserved, was held in Philadelphia January 11, 1682. There were six\r\nbills presented to the Grand Jury, all but one having to do with the\r\nhighway. That one exception was a petition for a court house.\r\n\r\nThese tribunals lacked almost every element of distinctly English\r\nprocedure, but were continued by Penn. Justices of the Peace were from\r\ntime to time commissioned, some for the whole Province and some for a\r\nparticular county. Their attendance at court was secured by the penalty\r\nof a fine.\r\n\r\nTwelve jurymen were subsequently provided whose unanimous opinion was\r\nrequired to bring in a verdict. The panel of jurymen was drawn in a\r\nhighly primitive manner. “The names of the freemen were writ on small\r\npieces of paper and put into a hat and shaken, forty-eight of whom were\r\ndrawn by a child, and those so drawn stood for the Sheriff’s return.”\r\n\r\nThe civil jurisdiction of the County Courts was first distinctly defined\r\nin 1683, when all actions of debt, account or slander and all actions of\r\ntrespass were by Act of Assembly declared to be originally cognizable\r\nsolely by them. Other jurisdiction was given them by subsequent action\r\nof the Legislature.\r\n\r\nThe justices interfered to promote and defend the popular interests in\r\nall matters that were of public concern. In very early times they\r\ngranted letters of administration. They superintended the laying out of\r\nroads, apportioned the town lots to responsible applicants, took\r\nacknowledgments of deeds and registered the private brands and marks of\r\nconsiderable owners of cattle.\r\n\r\nThey exercised, too, a supervision over all bond servants, regulated the\r\nsale of their time, afforded summary relief if they were abused by their\r\nmasters, punished them with stripes or the pillory if they attempted to\r\nescape, and took care that they were at liberty to purchase their\r\nfreedom on reasonable terms.\r\n\r\nJuly 8, 1683, “Philip England made complaint against Sea Captain James\r\nKilner, who denieth all alleged against him, only the kicking of the\r\nmaid, and that was for spilling a chamber vessel upon the deck;\r\notherwise he was very kind to them.”\r\n\r\nThey were also intrusted with other duties. The minutes of the\r\nProvincial Council for February 12, 1687–8, show that the County Court\r\nof Philadelphia was ordered to cause “stocks and a cage to be provided,”\r\nand was required “to suppress the noise and drunkenness of Indians,\r\nespecially in the night, and to cause the crier to go to the extent of\r\neach street when he has anything to cry, and to put a check to horse\r\nracing.”\r\n\r\nIn 1702 the Grand Jury found true bills for the following offenses:\r\n\r\n“John Simes, ordinary, and others, for keeping a disorderly house to\r\ndebauch the youth. John was disguised in women’s clothes walking the\r\nstreets openly, and going from house to house against the laws of God\r\nand this Province, to the staining of the holy profession, and against\r\nthe law of nature. Edward James, a like offender, at an unreasonable\r\nhour of night.\r\n\r\n“Dorothy, wife of Richard Conterill, is indicted also for being masked\r\nin men’s clothes, walking and dancing in the house of said John Simes at\r\n10 o’clock at night. Sarah Stiver, wife of John Stiver, was also at the\r\nsame house, dressed in men’s clothes, and walked the streets.”\r\n\r\nIt is quite probable that these indictments stopped any further attempts\r\nto hold “masquerade balls” in Philadelphia for some years.\r\n\r\nIn 1703 three barbers were indicted for “trimming on the First day”;\r\nthree persons were brought before the Court for playing cards; a butcher\r\nwas in court for “killing meat in the street and leaving their blood and\r\noffals there,” another for “setting up a great reed stack on Mulberry\r\nStreet, and making a close fence about the same.” Many runaways were\r\npublicly whipped.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1708 “Solomon Cresson, a constable of the City of\r\nPhiladelphia, going his rounds at 1 o’clock at night and discovering a\r\nvery riotous assembly in a tavern, immediately ordered them to disperse,\r\nwhen John Evans, Esq., Governor of the Province, happened to be one of\r\nthem, and called Solomon in the house and flogged him very severely, and\r\nhad him imprisoned for two days.”\r\n\r\nIn 1731, at New Castle, “Catherine Bevan is ordered to be burned alive,\r\nfor the murder of her husband; and Peter Murphy, the servant who\r\nassisted her, to be hanged.”\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Pious Henry Antes Organized First\r\n                    Moravian Synod January 12, 1742\r\n\r\n\r\nPious Henry Antes assembled at his home in Germantown on January 12,\r\n1742, thirty-five persons, representing eight distinct denominations of\r\nthe Christian religion, and formed the first Moravian Synod.\r\n\r\nHeinrich Antes (Von Blume) of a noble family in the Palatinate, was born\r\nabout 1620. He left a son, Philip Frederick, born about 1670.\r\n\r\nWhen Philip Frederick and his wife came to America they brought only the\r\noldest, Johann Heinrich, born in 1701, and the youngest, Mary Elizabeth,\r\nalong.\r\n\r\nIt is not known exactly when the Antes family arrived in America. The\r\nlast time we find the name of Philip Frederick Antes in the Freinsheim\r\nChurch book of baptisms is in September, 1716. The first time we find\r\nhis name in America is in the Deed Book of Philadelphia County, in\r\nFebruary, 1723, when there was recorded a deed conveying to Antes a\r\ntract of 154 acres along the Swamp Creek. In the deed Antes is described\r\nas a resident of Germantown. On April 9, 1742, he married Elizabeth\r\nWayman. In 1725, Philip Frederick Antes lived in Frederick Township,\r\nwhere he died November 28, 1746.\r\n\r\nHenry Antes, the son, was taught the trade of carpenter and mill-wright\r\nbefore coming to America. He was tall in stature, of a large frame,\r\nstrong physique and enjoyed robust health.\r\n\r\nAfter his father moved to New Hanover Township, Henry stayed in\r\nGermantown, where he engaged in partnership with William Dewees in the\r\nconstruction of a paper mill and grist mill, both at Crefeld along the\r\nWissahickon.\r\n\r\nOn February 2, 1726, Henry Antes was married to his partner’s daughter,\r\nChristina Elizabeth Dewees, who was born in Pennsylvania in 1702. She\r\ndied October 5, 1782. The ceremony was celebrated by John Philip Boehm,\r\npastor of the German Reformed congregations of Falkner Swamp, Skippack\r\nand Whitemarsh.\r\n\r\nHis trade took him to various parts of the settled portion of\r\nPennsylvania. His services were in constant demand. Antes became known\r\nto many people. He was thoroughly familiar with the streams, water\r\npower, forest and soil of many localities.\r\n\r\nOn September 2, 1735, he bought 175 acres in Frederick Township, near\r\nhis father’s farm. In partnership with George Heebner he at once began\r\nthe erection of a grist mill upon his own property, which for many years\r\nwas known far and wide as Antes’ Mill.\r\n\r\nAntes lived the rest of his life on his Frederick Township farm, except\r\nwhen temporarily called away, and during his short residence in\r\nBethlehem among the Moravians.\r\n\r\nIn 1736 Antes had a quarrel with the Reverend Mr. Boehm, the cause of\r\nwhich is not known. Boehm said he had occasion to speak to Antes several\r\ntimes on necessary matters. A statement friendly to Antes said it was\r\ncaused by Antes rebuking Boehm for unbecoming behavior. It was probably\r\ncaused by Boehm speaking to Antes in protest at his close association\r\nwith Bishop Spangenberg. At any rate Antes left Boehm’s church and\r\nbecame a Moravian.\r\n\r\nIn religious matters Henry Antes displayed much zeal and activity. He\r\nbecame known as the “Pious Layman of Fredericktown.” He taught the\r\nproper way of life to his countrymen, frequently calling them together\r\nin their homes for prayers, reading of the scriptures and exhortation.\r\nHe was thus employed in Oley as early as 1736.\r\n\r\nIn 1740 a great religious revival occurred in Falkner Swamp. George\r\nWhitefield, the great revivalist, preached at the house of Christopher\r\nWiegner at Skippack, then later in the day he preached at the house of\r\nHenry Antes. About two thousand persons, mostly Germans, with some\r\nQuakers, Dunkards, Swedes, Huguenots and other church people were in\r\nattendance.\r\n\r\nAntes yearned for the unity of the followers of the Christian religion.\r\n\r\nOn November 24, 1741, Count Zinzindorf came to Philadelphia to unite the\r\nleading men of the several denominations in Pennsylvania for evangelical\r\nwork. John Bechtel indorsed the movement, and Henry Antes issued a call\r\nfor the first meeting in furtherance of this object to be held in\r\nGermantown. In order to command the confidence of German colonists it\r\nwas necessary that the movement be recommended by one well known to the\r\npeople, so Antes issued the call.\r\n\r\nBecause the movement did not meet with success in the way anticipated\r\nHenry Antes really died of a broken heart. The Moravian Church, however,\r\nwas one of the results.\r\n\r\nDuring the session of the Moravian Synod, March, 1745, at the home of\r\nHenry Antes, he offered the use of his farm and buildings and his mill\r\nfor the brethren to be used as boarding school for boys.\r\n\r\nOn June 3, 1745, the school was started with thirty-four scholars.\r\nChristina Francke Christopher, of Bethlehem, was superintendent, and\r\nJohn C. Heyne, a teacher. The Moravians named it Mount Frederick School,\r\nand it was the first nonsectarian school in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nAntes and his family, excepting two sons, John and Henry, who remained\r\nas pupils, moved to Bethlehem. Here he gave his whole time to the\r\ntemporal affairs of the Moravians. He planned and superintended the\r\nbuilding of the first mills, dams, bridges and houses at the different\r\nMoravian settlements.\r\n\r\nOn December 15, 1745, he was appointed by King George of England, to be\r\nJustice of the Peace for Bucks County, in which Bethlehem was then a\r\npart. October 27, 1748, Henry Antes was appointed business manager of\r\nthe Moravians.\r\n\r\nIn 1750 Antes withdrew from the Moravians, because he did not approve of\r\nthe introduction of the wearing of a white surplice by the minister at\r\nthe celebration of the Eucharist.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of that year the white scholars were transferred to\r\nthe schools at Oley and Macgungie and the Indians and Negroes to\r\nBethlehem, and in September, 1750, Mount Frederick School was closed and\r\nHenry Antes moved back to his farm.\r\n\r\nIn 1752 Antes was appointed justice of the peace for Philadelphia\r\nCounty, but at this time his health was broken, caused by an injury\r\nreceived during the construction of the Friedenstal Mill, near Nazareth.\r\n\r\nOn August 25, 1752, Antes accompanied Bishop Spangenberg to North\r\nCarolina. Antes was in miserable health and returned home in the spring\r\nof 1753. He was an invalid until he died July 20, 1755.\r\n\r\nHe was buried by the Moravians in the family graveyard beside his\r\nfather. Bishop Spangenberg preached the funeral sermon. Ten pall-bearers\r\nfrom Bethlehem carried his body to its final resting place.\r\n\r\nAntes left four distinguished sons: Frederick, a delegate to the\r\nProvincial Convention in Carpenters’ Hall, a colonel of the Sixth\r\nBattalion of Philadelphia County Militia, which participated in the\r\nBattle of Brandywine, etc. He removed to Northumberland where he held\r\nmany important positions of honor and trust, and was president judge of\r\nthe county. He was the father-in-law of Governor Simon Snyder; William,\r\na lieutenant colonel in the Revolution; John, a Moravian who suffered\r\nuntold agonies in a mission field in Egypt; and John Henry, Lieutenant\r\nColonel in Revolution, sheriff of Northumberland County and the pioneer\r\nsettler of what is Nippenose Valley in Lycoming County. Five daughters\r\nalso survived Pious Henry Antes.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 General Simon Cameron Defeated Colonel\r\n                    Forney for United States Senate,\r\n                            January 13, 1857\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat excitement prevailed all over the State of Pennsylvania, and the\r\nDemocracy of the great Commonwealth were thrown into intense\r\nperturbation and indignation, January 13, 1857, by dispatches from\r\nHarrisburg announcing that Representatives Samuel Manear, of York\r\nCounty, William H. Lebo, and G. Wagenseller, of Schuylkill County,\r\nDemocratic members of the Legislature, had not only refused to support\r\nJohn W. Forney, the caucus nominee of their party for United States\r\nSenator, but had given their votes to the opposition candidate, Simon\r\nCameron.\r\n\r\nForney was one of the favorites of the Philadelphia Democracy at this\r\ntime, and they were moved to the warmest feelings of resentment by the\r\nbase treachery which had removed from his grasp the cherished object of\r\nhis ambition.\r\n\r\nMeetings were held by various clubs and organizations, denouncing the\r\ntraitors in unmeasured terms. The names of Manear, Lebo and Wagonseller\r\nremained for many years synonymous with corruption.\r\n\r\nAt Harrisburg the hotels long refused to receive them, and in\r\nPhiladelphia and other places there yet remain some who have not\r\nforgotten to regard them with contempt.\r\n\r\nThe result of this unforeseen defeat of Colonel Forney was the loss of\r\nan accomplished publicist and statesman, and to give Philadelphia, in\r\nthe career which opened before him a few months later, its most eminent\r\njournalist.\r\n\r\nThe story of this political event is interesting to students of the\r\nhistory of our state.\r\n\r\nWhen Hon. James Buchanan was appointed Secretary of State, by President\r\nPolk, in 1845, he resigned from the United States Senate to accept the\r\ncabinet portfolio.\r\n\r\nThis vacancy brought into the political limelight Simon Cameron, then\r\none of the leaders of the Democratic Party in the State.\r\n\r\nCameron had arisen from his printer’s case in his native county of\r\nLancaster, and had attained prominence as a newspaper publisher in\r\nDoylestown and Harrisburg, and had been appointed to the office of\r\nAdjutant General by Governor Shulze, when he was but thirty years of\r\nage. He had extensive banking and large iron interests for that day. He\r\nhad become a wealthy and influential man.\r\n\r\nOn account of his business interests he did not give enthusiastic\r\nsupport to Polk, yet held his grip on the management of the party in\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThere were a number of prominent candidates for the senatorship to\r\nsucceed Buchanan, one of whom was the able George W. Woodward, who\r\nfinally received the nomination of his party, and there did not seem to\r\nbe a ripple on the political surface.\r\n\r\nBut Cameron saw his opportunity, and with the power of the canal board,\r\nwhich he controlled, together with a combination of Protection or\r\nCameron Democrats with the Whigs, Cameron defeated Woodward, and served\r\nfrom 1845 to 1849. His election was a keen disappointment to President\r\nPolk and Secretary of State Buchanan.\r\n\r\nThe new Republican Party became a national organization in 1856.\r\n\r\nFormer Senator Simon Cameron was in the Know Nothing organization but\r\nwas smarting under his long and bitter contest for Senator in 1855, when\r\nhe was defeated by former Governor William Bigler.\r\n\r\nColonel John W. Forney was chairman of Democratic State Committee and\r\nhad absolute charge of the battle that was fought for the election of\r\nJames Buchanan, to whom he was romantically attached.\r\n\r\nIn the event of Buchanan’s election Forney was assured the editorship of\r\nthe Washington Union, the organ of the administration, and the Senate\r\nprinting. There were subsequent developments which led the President to\r\nassent to the sacrifice of Forney, and when tendered a cabinet position,\r\nthe President was forced to recall it.\r\n\r\nPresident Buchanan then turned to the Legislature of Pennsylvania, which\r\nwas still Democratic, and asked that Colonel Forney be elected United\r\nStates Senator.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic Party was demoralized in 1856, when many of its most\r\ndistinguished members supported Fremont, and in this condition, the\r\nparty lines were rather closely drawn. The Senate stood fifteen\r\nDemocrats to eighteen opposition, and the House had fifty-three\r\nDemocrats to forty-seven opposition, giving the Democrats three majority\r\non joint ballot.\r\n\r\nThe nomination of Forney was not cordially supported by those who were\r\nsmarting under the defeat he had given them in October, but there were\r\nvery few who were favorable to Cameron, and certainly not one-fourth of\r\nthe members would have preferred him as a candidate.\r\n\r\nBut Cameron, with his exceptional shrewdness as a political manager, saw\r\nthat he could depend upon the resentments against Forney among the\r\nopposition members to support him if he could assure them of his ability\r\nto defeat Forney.\r\n\r\nCameron was most fortunate in having in the Senate as one of his earnest\r\nfriends Charles B. Penrose, of Philadelphia, a former Senator, and a man\r\nof ripe experience and great political sagacity. He was quite as earnest\r\nin his desire to punish Forney as he was to promote his friend, General\r\nCameron.\r\n\r\nCameron was not nominated in the caucus, but had the assurance from\r\nRepresentatives Lebo, Manear and Wagonseller, all Democrats, that they\r\nwould vote for him if their votes could elect him.\r\n\r\nThis information was communicated to Senator Penrose, who very shrewdly\r\nstated to the Republican caucus that the defection of these three votes\r\nwould elect General Cameron, if they would unite in their support. The\r\nRepublicans refused to take any action until the members could have\r\nabsolute information as to the Democratic defection.\r\n\r\nPenrose had the caucus name three members who could be trusted and he\r\nwould arrange for an interview. This was held at Omit’s Hotel, and Lebo,\r\nManear and Wagonseller gave the assurance required, and the committee\r\nreported the fact to the caucus, but they were pledged not to divulge\r\nthe names of the three persons.\r\n\r\nThe caucus was somewhat distrustful, but agreed to vote once for\r\nCameron.\r\n\r\nThe voting took place only in joint convention, and when the House and\r\nSenate met, the compact was carried out to the letter, and Cameron was\r\nelected over Forney for a full term senatorship.\r\n\r\nThe whole arrangement was conducted with such secrecy that not one of\r\nthe opposition legislators had any idea as to what Democrats had bolted,\r\nand the Democrats themselves did not doubt the fidelity of any of their\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Railroads Fight to Enter Pittsburgh. Great\r\n                   State Convention January 14, 1846\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was but natural that the great undeveloped wealth of the Mississippi\r\nValley should attract those who had any vision as to the future of this\r\nvast country. This enormous wealth must be dumped into the great cities\r\nplanted along the Atlantic seaboard.\r\n\r\nGeneral Washington, skilled surveyor that he was, early trained his eyes\r\nwestward, and he spent much time in outlining plans for connecting the\r\nPotomac and Ohio Rivers by means of a canal. Twenty-five years after his\r\ndeath the Erie Canal was opened, when the merchants of Philadelphia and\r\nBaltimore realized they must awaken or succumb.\r\n\r\nBaltimore believed a railroad should be built to the West. The Baltimore\r\nand Ohio, first of all great railroads, shows by its name the purpose\r\nfor which it was incorporated. Pennsylvania, however, undertook to\r\nconnect the West by a system of combined railroads and canals.\r\n\r\nFrom the first both cities looked to Pittsburgh as the logical terminus\r\nof their improvements. Then began a struggle of Philadelphia-Baltimore\r\nrivalry, which lasted for forty-three years, from 1828 to 1871.\r\n\r\nIn 1828 Pennsylvania had given a charter to the Baltimore and Ohio, by\r\nwhich it could construct its line through Southwestern Pennsylvania to\r\nPittsburgh. The members of the Legislature at that time did not consider\r\nfuture competition, for the State works had not been built.\r\n\r\nThe charter was granted for fifteen years, and, in 1839, another act\r\nextended its provisions until 1847. This act, among other onerous\r\nconditions, was discriminating in favor of traffic to Philadelphia; it\r\nalso contained a heavy State tax on freight, and the company could not\r\naccept it.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania State works from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh were\r\ncompleted in 1834. When the charter of the Baltimore and Ohio expired in\r\n1843, the road was completed only as far as Cumberland.\r\n\r\nThe company tried to obtain better terms from Pennsylvania. The\r\nresidents of the western part of the State were all eager for an\r\nadditional outlet to the coast, but the Philadelphia politicians were\r\nunwilling to yield any concession to their Baltimore rivals.\r\n\r\nSeveral years later it was admitted that the State works would never\r\nprovide adequate transportation facilities to the West, even though in\r\nexcess of $10,000,000 had already been expended and the State seriously\r\ninvolved. Pennsylvanians were made to realize that railroads were\r\nsuperior to canals and that the commercial solution of Philadelphia lay\r\nin a central railroad to Pittsburgh.\r\n\r\nThe feeling in all three cities reached fever heat. The legislative hall\r\nwas the battleground and all interests were well represented. The battle\r\ncentered on the bill granting right of way through Pennsylvania to the\r\nBaltimore and Ohio Railroad.\r\n\r\nPublic meetings were held in Philadelphia and elsewhere. A State\r\nrailroad convention was held at Harrisburg, January 14, 1846, where\r\nresolutions were adopted favoring the Central Railroad scheme and\r\nagainst the Baltimore and Ohio right of way grant.\r\n\r\nThe people of Pennsylvania believed since a railroad must be built it\r\nwould be better for it to be run entirely through Pennsylvania and be a\r\nPennsylvania institution. They also felt that if the Baltimore and Ohio\r\nRailroad was given the franchise, it would be next to impossible to\r\nraise money to build the Pennsylvania Railroad.\r\n\r\nPittsburgh business interests were fearful if the Baltimore and Ohio\r\nRailroad was refused admission to Pennsylvania that road would extend\r\nits rails farther down the Ohio to Wheeling, perhaps, and thus control\r\nriver trade, which had been long enjoyed at Pittsburgh. Many meetings\r\nwere held in Pittsburgh urging the support of the Baltimore bill. It\r\nmust also be understood that State prejudice held back railroads from\r\nentering other States. In 1846 States rights theories were more\r\npotential than they are today.\r\n\r\nIn this connection the position of the Baltimore and Ohio was\r\nunfortunate and interesting. Either Pennsylvania or Virginia must\r\ncharter the company before a road of great importance could be built.\r\nNeither State was willing to do so.\r\n\r\nThe Baltimore and Ohio bill was defeated in the Senate February 23,\r\n1846, by a single vote. Philadelphia rejoiced and Pittsburgh was sad.\r\nThe Senate reversed itself February 26, and Philadelphia was maddened\r\nbeyond reason.\r\n\r\nOn April 10 the Baltimore bill passed the House, with an amendment\r\nproviding that the grant to the Baltimore and Ohio should be null and\r\nvoid if the Pennsylvania Railroad obtained subscriptions of $3,000,000\r\nin capital stock, of which $900,000 must be paid in cash by July 31. The\r\nbill passed the Senate and was signed by Governor Shunk, April 21.\r\n\r\nEvery effort was exerted to procure the subscriptions, a house-to-house\r\ncanvass resulting in 2600 subscriptions. Nearly all of which were for\r\nfive shares or less.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia won the struggle and the conditions were met in time.\r\nGovernor Shunk issued a proclamation announcing the grant to Baltimore\r\nand Ohio Railroad to be null and void.\r\n\r\nIn 1837 a group of Pittsburgh men obtained a charter for the Pittsburgh\r\nand Connellsville Railroad. This with the design to get into Baltimore,\r\nas it would build fifty-eight miles of the route to that city.\r\n\r\nThat scheme fell through, but in 1843 the charter was renewed and the\r\ninterest of the Baltimore crowd was obtained. But they did not seem to\r\nappreciate the advantage secured for them by the astute Pittsburgh\r\nbusiness men, and the Pittsburgh and Connellsville relapsed into\r\nslumberland until 1853.\r\n\r\nThe Baltimore and Ohio had completed its line to Wheeling and the\r\nPennsylvania was about to finish its line into Pittsburgh. The\r\nPittsburgh and Connellsville obtained authority to make connection with\r\nthe Baltimore and Ohio at Cumberland. But new troubles arose. The\r\npresident of the company embezzled the funds and the City of Baltimore\r\nfailed to give as liberally as promised.\r\n\r\nIn spite of those obstacles the road was opened from Pittsburgh to\r\nConnellsville January, 1857. Then came the panic of 1857 and the\r\ndepression by the prospect of the Civil War.\r\n\r\nIn 1864 the stretch of ninety miles between Uniontown and Cumberland\r\nagain became a political matter. Thomas A. Scott, president of the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad, determined this link should not be built, as the\r\nlast thing he wanted was a competing line in Pittsburgh.\r\n\r\nOn April 11, 1864, two bills were introduced into the Legislature. One\r\nclaimed the Pittsburgh and Connellsville Railroad had misused its\r\ncharter; the other incorporated a new railroad from Connellsville. The\r\nbills passed and became laws without the approval of Governor Curtin.\r\n\r\nJudge Grier in United States Court June 20, 1865, held the repeal of the\r\nPittsburgh and Connellsville to be unconstitutional. This case now\r\nbecame a legal battle for years and eventually got into Congress and\r\nback into the Pennsylvania Legislature. On January 29, 1868, the Supreme\r\nCourt of Pennsylvania unanimously decided in favor of the Pittsburgh and\r\nConnellsville Railroad. The next day the Legislature repealed the Act of\r\n1864.\r\n\r\nThe happy ending was in spite of all litigation. Pittsburgh and the\r\ngreat mineral and lumber wealth along the Monongahela and Youghiogheny\r\nValleys was opened up, and on June 26, 1871, the Pittsburgh, Washington\r\nand Baltimore Railroad was formally opened and the long struggle for\r\nPittsburgh ended.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Governor Andrew G. Curtin Inaugurated\r\n                     War Governor January 15, 1861\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrew Gregg Curtin, of Bellefonte, was inaugurated Governor of\r\nPennsylvania January 15, 1861, and assumed the office at a time when the\r\ngravest problems ever presented to American statesmanship were to be\r\nsolved. The mutterings of the coming storm were approaching nearer and\r\nnearer, and the year opened up gloomily.\r\n\r\nIn his inaugural he took occasion “to declare that Pennsylvania would,\r\nunder any circumstances, render a full and determined support of the\r\nfree institutions of the Union,” and pledged himself to stand between\r\nthe Constitution and all encroachments instigated by hatred, ambition,\r\nfanaticism and folly.\r\n\r\nHe spoke with words of deliberation, decision and wisdom, and made a\r\nrecord of statesmanship that stood the severe test of years of bloody\r\nand lasting war. The conflict obliterated old and sacred landmarks in\r\npolitical teaching.\r\n\r\nOn February 17, the House adopted resolutions pledging to Maryland the\r\nfellowship and support of Pennsylvania. On January 24, the House had\r\nadopted resolutions taking high ground in favor of sustaining the\r\nConstitution of the Union.\r\n\r\nThreatening as was the danger, while the Legislature was in session and\r\nmeetings were being held in Philadelphia and throughout the State, no\r\none anticipated that the strife would actually break forth so suddenly,\r\nnor that it would grow to such fearful proportions at the very\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\nIt is true, that the soldiers of the South, who had long secretly been\r\npreparing to dissolve the Union unmasked their design when the guns of\r\nFort Moultrie were trained on Fort Sumter, in Charleston harbor, South\r\nCarolina, April 12, 1861. No State in the Union was less prepared, so\r\nfar as munitions of war were concerned, to take its part in the conflict\r\nthan Pennsylvania. Her volunteer soldiery system had fallen in decay.\r\n\r\nThere were fewer volunteer companies of militia in Pennsylvania at that\r\nmoment than ever before on the rolls of the Adjutant General’s office.\r\nBut when the first overt act was committed, and the news was flashed\r\nover the Northland, it created no fiercer feeling of resentment anywhere\r\nthan it did throughout the Keystone State.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of April 12, 1861, a message was handed to Governor\r\nCurtin in Harrisburg which read as follows:\r\n\r\n“The war is commenced. The batteries began firing at 4 o’clock this\r\nmorning. Major Anderson replied, and a brisk cannonading commenced. This\r\nis reliable and has just come by Associated Press. The vessels were not\r\nin sight.”\r\n\r\nLater in the day, in response to the Governor’s suggestion, the\r\nLegislature passed an act reorganizing the military department of the\r\nState and appropriated $500,000 for the purpose.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln issued a proclamation, April 15, calling out 75,000\r\nmilitia from the different States to serve for three months. A\r\nrequisition was at once made on Pennsylvania for fourteen regiments. The\r\nalacrity with which these regiments were furnished demonstrated not so\r\nmuch the military ardor as it did the patriotic spirit of the people.\r\nSufficient men were rushed to Harrisburg not only to fill up the State\r\nquota of fourteen regiments, but enough to organize twenty-five.\r\n\r\nThere were two distinguished patriotic Pennsylvanians who comprehended\r\nthe seriousness of the situation from the outset. General Simon Cameron,\r\nwho had resigned his seat in the United States Senate to become the\r\nSecretary of War in President Lincoln’s Cabinet, advised the\r\norganization of the most powerful army the North could raise, so that at\r\none blow armed rebellion might be effectually crushed. Governor Curtin\r\ntook advantage of the excess men offering their services and began at\r\nonce, after the complement of the three months’ men had been furnished\r\nto the Federal Government, to organize the famous Reserve Corps.\r\n\r\nHe discovered the approaching tornado in the distance, and thus\r\ncommenced to prepare for its fury, the Reserves being the only troops\r\nwell organized and disciplined in the North ready for the services of\r\nthe Union at the moment of the disaster of the first battle of Bull Run.\r\n\r\nDuring the second year of the Civil War, Governor Curtin broke down his\r\nhealth through overwork and anxiety, and was compelled to give himself,\r\nfor weeks at a time, to the exclusive care of eminent physicians.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln, appreciating Curtin’s faithful services, and\r\nrecognizing the necessity for a change of climate and employment,\r\nformally tendered him a first-class Foreign Mission, which the Governor\r\nsignified his willingness to accept when his term should expire. But in\r\nthe meantime he was nominated for re-election, and again entered upon\r\nthe canvass, and was elected by more than 15,000 majority.\r\n\r\nAs is well known, the early part of the war went against the Union\r\nforces. All through the North there were many persons, the “peace at any\r\nprice” men, who thought war was wrong, or a failure, and tried to have\r\nit end. Governor Curtin, in order to check this feeling, issued an\r\ninvitation to the Northern Governors to hold a meeting, for the purpose\r\nof considering how the Government might be more strongly supported and\r\nhow the loyalty of the people might be increased.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1862, just after the battle of Antietam, which stopped\r\nLee’s invasion of the north, eleven Governors met at Altoona. They\r\nadopted an address to President Lincoln, warmly commending his\r\nEmancipation Proclamation. The Governors then went to Washington,\r\npresented the address, and asked Lincoln to keep on hand in the various\r\nstates a reserve army of 100,000, and pledged “Loyal and cordial\r\nsupport, hereafter as heretofore.” It gave Lincoln renewed courage for\r\nhis heavy task.\r\n\r\nIn 1866, his health was such that his life was despaired of and in\r\nNovember his physicians ordered him to Cuba to recuperate. President\r\nJohnson offered him a foreign post but he again declined to leave his\r\nexecutive duties in the state and completed his term.\r\n\r\nIn 1867 he was a strong candidate for the United States Senate and a\r\nyear later received a large vote for vice president in the Republican\r\nConvention which nominated General Grant for President. Soon after Grant\r\nbecame President, he nominated former Governor Curtin for Minister to\r\nRussia, and he was promptly confirmed by the Senate.\r\n\r\nBefore embarking for his new post of duty Governor Curtin was the\r\nrecipient of a marked evidence of devotion. The Councils of Philadelphia\r\nunanimously invited him to a public reception in Independence Hall and\r\nin addition, the leading citizens, without distinction of party, united\r\nin giving him a banquet at the Academy of Music, that has seldom been\r\nequalled for elegance and every manifestation of popular affection and\r\napplause.\r\n\r\nHe sailed June, 1869, and in the discharge of his diplomatic duties\r\nproved himself one of the most popular representatives ever sent abroad\r\nby our nation. He was again supported for the vice presidential\r\nnomination in 1872.\r\n\r\nGovernor Curtin died October 7, 1894, in fullness of years, and\r\nBellefonte mourned as it had never done before, and there was given to\r\nthe great War Governor the biggest soldier’s funeral that the Bald Eagle\r\nValley ever saw.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Simon Girty, Outlaw and Renegade,\r\n                         Born January 16, 1744\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch of the ride along the Susquehanna trail on the western side of the\r\nSusquehanna River is at the base of majestic hills along the old\r\nPennsylvania Canal bed, and more beautiful scenery it is not possible to\r\nfind anywhere. Especially is this true as the motorist nears the quaint\r\ntown of Liverpool. A few miles before reaching this place there is a gap\r\nin the mountains long known as Girty’s Gap, named in memory of one of\r\nthe most despised outlaws in the provincial history of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe rocks on the face of the precipitous hills at this point have formed\r\nan almost perfect Indian head; indeed, it seems to be smiling down upon\r\nthe thousands who pause to view this wonderful natural likeness of the\r\nprimitive American race.\r\n\r\nSo important is this rock-face that when the new State highway was being\r\nbuilt at this point summer of 1922, the engineers intended that the\r\nrocks should be blasted out and the road straightened at this bend, but\r\non account of the sentiment connected with this really wonderful image\r\nthe roadway was finally laid around the rocks and so the Indian face at\r\nGirty’s Notch is still to be seen.\r\n\r\nSimon Girty, Senior, was a licensed Indian trader on the frontiers of\r\nPennsylvania as early as 1740, and about that period he located on\r\nSherman’s Creek, in what is now Perry County. Here his son, Simon, who\r\nfigures so conspicuously in the annals of border life, was born January\r\n16, 1744. There were three other sons, Thomas, George and James.\r\n\r\nIn 1750, the father and sundry other “squatters” on Sherman’s Creek,\r\nwere dispossessed of their settlements by the Sheriff of Cumberland\r\nCounty and his posses, under orders of the Provincial authorities.\r\n\r\nGirty removed his family to the east side of the Susquehanna River, near\r\nwhere the town of Halifax is now situated. Afterward he moved to the\r\nConococheague settlement, where it is related he was killed in a drunken\r\nbrawl. In 1756, his widow was killed by the savages, and Simon, George\r\nand James were taken captives by the Indians. Thomas, the eldest\r\nbrother, being absent at his uncle’s at Antietam, was the only one who\r\nescaped.\r\n\r\nSimon Girty was adopted by the Seneca and given the Indian name of\r\nKatepacomen. He became an expert hunter, and in dress, language and\r\nhabits became a thorough Indian. The author of “Crawford’s Campaign”\r\nsays that “it must be passed to his credit that his early training as a\r\nsavage was compulsory, not voluntary as has generally been supposed.”\r\n\r\nGeorge Girty was adopted by the Delaware and became a fierce and\r\nferocious savage, while James, who was adopted into the Shawnee nation,\r\nbecame no less infamous as a cruel and bloodthirsty raider of the\r\nKentucky border, “sparing not even women and children from horrid\r\ntortures.”\r\n\r\nSimon Girty and his tribe roamed the wilderness northwest of the Ohio,\r\nand when the expedition under Colonel Henry Bouquet, at the close of the\r\nPontiac War, in 1764, dictated peace to the Indian tribe on the\r\nMuskingum, one of the hostages given up by the Ohio Indians was Simon\r\nGirty. Preferring the wild life of the savage, Girty soon escaped and\r\nreturned to his home among the Seneca.\r\n\r\nOne of the conditions of the treaty referred to, was the yielding up by\r\nthe Ohio Indians of all their captives, willing or unwilling. This being\r\nthe case, Girty was again returned to the settlements and took up his\r\nhome near Fort Pitt, on the little run emptying into the Allegheny and\r\nsince known as Girty’s Run.\r\n\r\nIn the unprovoked war of Lord Dunmore, in company with Simon Kenton,\r\nGirty served as a hunter and scout. He subsequently acted as an Indian\r\nagent, and became intimately acquainted with Colonel William Crawford,\r\nat whose cabin on the Youghiogheny he was a frequent and welcome guest,\r\nand it is stated by some writers, although without any worthwhile\r\nevidence to substantiate it, was a suitor for the hand of one of his\r\ndaughters, but was rejected.\r\n\r\nAt the outset of the Revolution, Simon Girty was a commissioned officer\r\nof militia at Fort Pitt, took the test oath as required by the Committee\r\nof Safety, but March 28, 1778, deserted to the enemy, in company with\r\nthe notorious Alexander McKee and Matthew Elliott.\r\n\r\nSimon Girty began his wild career by sudden forays against the\r\nborderers, and in his fierceness and cruelty outdid the Indians\r\nthemselves. Hence the sobriquet of “Girty the White Savage.”\r\n\r\nMany atrocious crimes were attributed to the notorious renegade, but the\r\ncampaign against the Sandusky Indian towns in 1782, under the command of\r\nColonel William Crawford, proved to be the one in which Girty displayed\r\nthe most hardened nature and showed him to be a relentless foe of the\r\nColonies.\r\n\r\nGirty’s brutality reached its climax when he refused any request, even\r\nto discuss terms of easier punishment for his former friend and brother\r\nofficer, but viewed with apparent satisfaction the most horrible and\r\nexcruciating tortures which that ill-fated but brave and gallant\r\nCrawford was doomed to suffer. This episode in his career has placed his\r\nname among the most infamous whose long list of crimes causes a shudder\r\nas the details are told, even after a lapse of a century and a half.\r\n\r\nDuring the next seven years but little is recorded of this renegade and\r\ndesperado, except that a year after Crawford’s defeat, he married\r\nCatharine Malott, a captive among the Shawnee. They had several children\r\nand she survived her husband many years, dying at an advanced age.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding Girty’s brutality and depravity he never lost the\r\nconfidence of the Indians; the advice of Simon Girty was always\r\nconclusive.\r\n\r\nGirty acted as interpreter when the United States attempted to negotiate\r\nwith the Confederated Nations, for an adjustment of the difficulties\r\nduring which his conduct was insolent, and he was false in his duty as\r\ninterpreter.\r\n\r\nIn the defeat of General St. Clair, Girty saw and knew General Richard\r\nButler, who was writhing in agony with his wounds. The traitor told a\r\nsavage warrior he was a high officer, whereupon the Indian buried his\r\ntomahawk in General Butler’s head, scalped him, took his heart out and\r\ndivided it into as many pieces as there were tribes engaged in the\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nWhen General Anthony Wayne in 1795 forever destroyed the power of the\r\nIndians of the Northwest, Girty sold his trading post and removed to\r\nCanada, where he settled upon a farm near Malden, on the Detroit River,\r\nthe recipient of a British pension. Here he resided until the War of\r\n1812 undisturbed, but almost blind.\r\n\r\nAfter the capture of the British fleet on Lake Erie, Girty followed the\r\nBritish in retreat and remained away from his home until the treaty of\r\npeace was signed, when he returned to his farm, where he died in the\r\nfall of 1819, aged seventy-four years.\r\n\r\nThere have been efforts to make a hero of Girty, but without success. He\r\nwas without one redeeming quality. He reveled in the very excess of\r\nmalignity and above all in his hatred for his own countrymen. Such was\r\nthe life and career of Simon Girty, the outlaw and renegade.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Benjamin Franklin, Youngest Son of Seventeen\r\n                    Children, Born January 17, 1706\r\n\r\n\r\nBenjamin Franklin, American statesman, philosopher and printer, was born\r\nin Boston January 17, 1706, youngest son of the seventeen children of\r\nJosiah and Abiah Folger Franklin.\r\n\r\nBorn a subject of Queen Anne of England and on the same day receiving\r\nthe baptismal name of Benjamin in the Old South Church, he continued for\r\nmore than seventy of the eighty-four years of his life a subject of four\r\nsuccessive British monarchs. During that period, neither Anne nor the\r\nthree Georges, who succeeded her, had a subject of whom they had more\r\nreason to be proud nor one whom at his death their people generally\r\nsupposed they had more reason to detest.\r\n\r\nFranklin learned the art of printing with his brother, but they\r\ndisagreeing, Benjamin left Boston when seventeen years old, sought\r\nemployment in New York, but, not succeeding, went to Philadelphia and\r\nthere found success, and for much more than half a century was the\r\ngreatest man in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nFranklin soon attracted the attention of Governor Keith, who, making him\r\na promise of the Government printing, induced young Franklin to go to\r\nEngland to purchase printing materials. He was deceived and remained\r\nthere eighteen months, working as a journeyman printer in London. He\r\nreturned to Philadelphia late in 1726, an accomplished printer and a man\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nIn 1730 he had a printing establishment and newspaper, the Pennsylvania\r\nGazette, and stationers’ shop of his own. Was married to Deborah Read, a\r\nyoung woman whose husband had absconded, and was already pressing upon\r\npublic opinion with a powerful leverage.\r\n\r\nFor many years he published an almanac under the assumed name of Richard\r\nSaunders. It became widely known as “Poor Richard’s Almanac,” and is\r\nstill one of the marvels of modern literature.\r\n\r\nAs a practical printer Franklin was reported to have had no superiors.\r\nAs a journalist he exerted an influence not only unrivaled in his day,\r\nbut more potent, on this continent at least, than either of his\r\nsovereigns or their parliaments.\r\n\r\nFranklin was the chief founder of the Philadelphia Library in 1731. The\r\norganization of a police and later of the militia for Philadelphia; of\r\ncompanies for extinguishing fires; making the sweeping and paving of the\r\nstreets a municipal function, and establishment of an academy which has\r\nmatured into the now famous University of Pennsylvania, were among the\r\nconspicuous reforms which he planted and watered in the columns of the\r\nGazette.\r\n\r\nIn 1736 he became clerk of the Provincial Assembly, and the following\r\nyear was postmaster of Philadelphia. He was the founder of the\r\nPhilosophical Society of Philadelphia in 1744, and six years later was\r\nelected to the Provincial Assembly.\r\n\r\nIn 1753 Franklin was appointed deputy postmaster for the\r\nEnglish-American colonies. In 1754 he was a delegate to the Colonial\r\nCongress at Albany, in which he prepared a plan of union for the\r\ncolonies, which was the basis of the Articles of Confederation adopted\r\nby Congress more than twenty years afterward.\r\n\r\nFranklin graduated from journalism into diplomacy as naturally as winter\r\nglides into spring.\r\n\r\nThe question of taxing the Penn Proprietary estates for the defense of\r\nthe Province from the French and Indians had assumed such an acute stage\r\nin 1757 that the Assembly decided to petition the King upon the subject,\r\nand selected Franklin to visit London and present their petition. The\r\nnext forty-one years of his life were virtually spent in the diplomatic\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nFranklin was five years absent on this first mission. Every interest in\r\nLondon was against him. He finally obtained a compromise, and for his\r\nsuccess the Penns and their partisans never forgave him, and his fellow\r\nColonists never forgot him.\r\n\r\nFranklin returned to Philadelphia in 1762, but not to remain. The\r\nquestion of taxing the Colonies without representation was soon thrust\r\nupon them in the shape of a stamp duty, and Franklin was sent out again\r\nto urge its repeal. He reached London in November, 1764, where he\r\nremained the next eleven years, until it became apparent that there\r\nwould never be a change during the reign of George III.\r\n\r\nSatisfied that his usefulness was at an end, he sailed for Philadelphia\r\nMarch 21, 1775, and on the morning of his arrival was elected by the\r\nAssembly of Pennsylvania a delegate to Continental Congress.\r\n\r\nFranklin served on ten committees in this Congress. He was one of five\r\nwho drew up the Declaration of Independence, July, 1776, and in\r\nSeptember following was chosen unanimously as one of the three\r\ncommissioners to be sent to solicit for the infant Republic the aid of\r\nFrance and the sympathies of Continental Europe.\r\n\r\nFranklin had begun his investigations and experiments in electricity, by\r\nwhich he demonstrated its identity with lightning, as early as 1746. The\r\npublication of his account of these experiments procured his election as\r\nan honorary member of the Royal Society of London and his undisputed\r\nrank among the most eminent natural philosophers of his time.\r\n\r\nHe received the Copley gold medal and the degree of LL.D. from Oxford\r\nand Edinburgh in 1762. Harvard and Yale had previously conferred upon\r\nhim the degree of master of arts.\r\n\r\nWhen Franklin arrived in Paris, therefore, he was already a member of\r\nevery important learned society in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe history of his mission and how Franklin succeeded in procuring\r\nfinancial aid from the French King, and finally a treaty of peace more\r\nfavorable to his country than either England or France wished to\r\nconcede, has been often told.\r\n\r\nFranklin’s reputation grew with his success. More was published about\r\nhim in the newspapers of the world than of any other man that ever\r\nlived.\r\n\r\nFranklin landed in Philadelphia on September 13, 1785, on the same wharf\r\non which sixty-two years before he had stepped, a friendless and\r\nvirtually penniless runaway apprentice of seventeen.\r\n\r\nThough now in his seventy-ninth year and a victim of infirmities, he had\r\nhardly unpacked his trunks when he was chosen a member of the Municipal\r\nCouncil of Philadelphia and its chairman. Shortly after he was elected\r\nPresident of Pennsylvania, his own vote only lacking to make the vote\r\nunanimous.\r\n\r\nHe was unanimously elected for two succeeding years, and while holding\r\nthat office was chosen a member of the convention which met in May,\r\n1787, to frame the Constitution under which the people of the United\r\nStates are still living. With the adoption of that instrument, to which\r\nhe contributed as much as any other individual, he retired from official\r\nlife, though not from the service of the public.\r\n\r\nHis last public act was the signing of a memorial to Congress on the\r\nsubject of human slavery by the Abolition Society, of which he was the\r\nfounder and president.\r\n\r\nHe died in Philadelphia April 17, 1790, and four days later his body was\r\ninterred in Christ Church burying ground. His funeral was such as the\r\ngreatest philosopher and statesman had deserved.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Long Reign of Terror by Mollie Maguires\r\n                    Brought to End January 18, 1876\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary 18, 1876, was an eventful day in Mauch Chunk, the county seat of\r\nCarbon County, and, in fact, for the State of Pennsylvania and the\r\nentire country.\r\n\r\nOn that day Michael J. Doyle, of Mount Laffee, Schuylkill County, and\r\nEdward Kelly were arraigned charged with the crime of the murder of John\r\nP. Jones, of Lansford.\r\n\r\nFor years preceding this murder the coal regions of Pennsylvania had\r\nbeen infested by a most desperate class of men, banded together for the\r\nworst purposes—called by some the Buckshots, by others the Mollie\r\nMaguires. They made such sad havoc of the country that life was no\r\nlonger secure and the regions suffered in many ways.\r\n\r\nThe unusual circumstance of this trial was the fact that it was the\r\nfirst indictment of a “Mollie Maguire” in this country which had a\r\npossible chance for ultimate conviction.\r\n\r\nJohn P. Jones was a mine boss who had incurred the illwill of some of\r\nthe Irish connected with the organization of Mollie Maguires, masking\r\nunder the Ancient Order of Hibernians, and on the morning of September\r\n3, 1875, he left his home in Lansford, in which were his wife and seven\r\nchildren, and traveled toward the breaker where he was employed. The\r\nthree assassins, James Kerrigan, Mike Doyle and Edward Kelly, were lying\r\nin wait for him and cruelly shot him down, killing him on the spot.\r\n\r\nThis crime was no more revolting or cruel than the many others committed\r\nby this murderous organization, but it was the one in which the\r\nPinkerton detective, James McParlan, had been able to connect all the\r\nfacts in the case, and with the additional assistance of James Kerrigan\r\nturning State’s witness the civil authorities were able to conduct such\r\na trial that the two other murderers were convicted.\r\n\r\nMichael Doyle was found guilty January 22, 1876, and sentenced to death.\r\nThis was the first conviction of a Mollie Maguire in this country.\r\nEdward Kelly was subsequently placed on trial for the same crime and on\r\nMarch 29 was found guilty. Doyle and Kelly both were hanged at Mauch\r\nChunk, June 21, 1876, and the Mollie Maguires ceased to be the terror of\r\ncivilized people.\r\n\r\nTo form some idea of the operations of these desperadoes it must be\r\nknown that the Mollie Maguires were more than bloodthirsty and active in\r\n1865. On August 25, that year, David Muir, superintendent of a colliery,\r\nwas shot and killed in broad daylight. On January 10, 1866, Henry H.\r\nDunne, a well known citizen of Pottsville, and superintendent of a large\r\ncolliery, was murdered on the highway near the city limits, while riding\r\nhome in his carriage. On Saturday, October 17, 1868, Alexander Rea,\r\nanother mining superintendent, was killed on the wagon road, near\r\nCentralia, Columbia County. Several arrests were made but no\r\nconvictions.\r\n\r\nOn March 15, 1869, William H. Littlehales, superintendent of the Glen\r\nCarbon Company, was killed on the highway enroute to his home in\r\nPottsville. F. W. S. Langdon, George K. Smith and Graham Powell, all\r\nmine officials, met death at the hands of assassins.\r\n\r\nOn December 2, 1871, Morgan Powell, assistant superintendent of the\r\nLehigh and Wilkes-Barre Coal and Iron Company, at Summitt Hill, Carbon\r\nCounty, was shot down on the street.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1873, F. B. Gowen, president of the Philadelphia and Reading\r\nRailway Company and the Philadelphia and Reading Coal and Iron Company,\r\nemployed Allan Pinkerton, the noted detective, to take charge of a\r\nthorough investigation of this organization.\r\n\r\nPinkerton accepted the commission and selected James McParlan, a young\r\nIrish street-car conductor of Chicago, to be his chief operative in this\r\nhazardous enterprise. On the evening of October 27, 1873, there arrived\r\nat Port Carbon a tramp who gave his name as one James McKenna, who was\r\nseeking work in the mines. This McKenna was none other than Detective\r\nMcParlan and well did he perform his task.\r\n\r\nMcParlan cleverly assumed the role of an old member of the order, and as\r\none who had committed such atrocious crimes in other parts of this\r\ncountry that he must be careful of undue publicity. He could sing and\r\ndance, and was an all around good fellow, but only feigned the drunken\r\nstupor in which he was so constantly being found by his associates.\r\n\r\nThe crowning event in his three years’ work was his initiation into the\r\nAncient Order of Hibernians, at Shenandoah, April 14, 1874. He was soon\r\nappointed secretary on account of his better education. In fact, he was\r\na leader and supposedly the most hardened criminal of the coal regions.\r\n\r\nOctober 31, 1874, George Major, Chief Burgess of Mahanoy City, was shot\r\nand killed by Mollie Maguires. On April 6, 1875, a despicable plot to\r\ndestroy the great bridge on the Catawissa Railroad only failed because\r\nthe Mollies in charge of the work failed to make the fire burn the\r\nstructure. McParlan was in on this crime, but had much to do with its\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\nConditions were so serious by June 1, 1875, that Governor Hartranft sent\r\nmilitia to Shenandoah and in their very faces 700 Mollies attempted to\r\ncapture and destroy a breaker, June 3. August 11 there was a great riot\r\nin Shenandoah. Edward Cosgrove and Gomer James were murdered and a\r\nbystander was killed during the riot.\r\n\r\nAugust 14, 1875, has since been known as “Bloody Saturday” in the coal\r\nregions. On that day Thomas Gwyther, a justice of the peace, of\r\nGirardville, was murdered. Miners rioted in many places.\r\n\r\nSeptember 1, Thomas Sanger, boss at Heaton & Co., colliery, near\r\nAshland, and William Uren were murdered. On September 3, John J. Jones,\r\nalready mentioned, was killed.\r\n\r\nAt the great trial the Commonwealth was represented by E. R. Siewers,\r\nthe able district attorney; F. W. Hughes, of Pottsville; General Charles\r\nAlbright, of Mauch Chunk, and Allen Craig. For the defense appeared Linn\r\nBartholomew, J. B. Reilly and John W. Ryon, of Pottsville; Daniel\r\nKalbfus and Edward Mulhearn of Mauch Chunk. James Kerrigan gave State’s\r\ntestimony, which left no doubt of the guilt of the prisoner, and this\r\nalso was the death knell to the Mollies. Arrests rapidly followed for\r\nthe other murders.\r\n\r\nWhen the Mollies learned of McParlan’s true character, they planned his\r\ndestruction, March 5, 1876, but now it was too late. Their nefarious\r\nwork was at an end.\r\n\r\nWhat might be said to be the closing climax of this reign of terror was\r\nthe trial in Bloomsburg, February 24, 1877, when Pat Hester, Pat Tully\r\nand Peter McHugh were arraigned for the murder of Alexander Rea. The\r\nfirst trial February 2, 1869, had resulted in acquittal for Thomas\r\nDonahue, and the other cases were dropped, but this time the three\r\nprisoners were found “guilty” and were hanged in Columbia County jail,\r\nMarch 25, 1878, nine years after the murder of Rea.\r\n\r\nOn May 21, 1877, Governor Hartranft signed the death warrants for eight\r\nother Mollies and on June 21 they were hanged. These, with the three\r\nhanged at Bloomsburg, brought to a close the business of the Mollie\r\nMaguires.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Prophetic Letter to President Buchanan by\r\n                  Governor Packer, Who Was Inaugurated\r\n                            January 19, 1858\r\n\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1857 was unusually active, as there were three prominent\r\ncandidates in the contest. The Democrats nominated State Senator William\r\nF. Packer, of Williamsport, one of the most widely known of the\r\nrepresentative men of the State; the Republicans named the Hon. David\r\nWilmot, of Towanda, author of the “Wilmot Proviso,” who enjoyed a\r\nwide-spread reputation as a public speaker and a politician; and the\r\nHon. Isaac Hazlehurst, was the choice of the Native American Party,\r\nstill quite a factor in Pennsylvania politics. After a spirited campaign\r\nSenator Packer was elected by a majority of fourteen thousand votes over\r\nboth the other candidates. He was inaugurated January 19, 1858.\r\n\r\nThe political question which overshadowed all others at this period was,\r\nwhether Kansas should be admitted into the union with or without a\r\nconstitutional recognition of slavery.\r\n\r\nGovernor Packer was an ardent friend of James Buchanan, and labored\r\nzealously to secure his nomination for the Presidency. Mr. Buchanan was\r\ninaugurated about the time of Packer’s nomination for Governor. The\r\nclouds were rapidly forming in Kansas where a state of hostility existed\r\nbetween the inhabitants and the general Government, and the agents of\r\nthe latter, for their safety, had been compelled to flee from the\r\nterritory. The slave-holders were making a desperate effort to control\r\nthe state and thus extend their sway.\r\n\r\nBuchanan had been in Washington only a few days when he received a\r\nletter from Mr. Packer, which in view of his prophetic utterances,\r\nhonest advice and the further fact that it was written by a\r\nPennsylvanian, so soon to become Governor, to a Pennsylvania President\r\nof the United States, that the following paragraphs should prove of\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nThe letter was dated Harrisburg, March 24, 1857.\r\n\r\n“Our people confidently expect that your administration will see that\r\nequal and exact justice shall be done to all parties—the free-state as\r\nwell as the pro-slavery men—and they will be satisfied with nothing\r\nshort of that. We approve of the Kansas bill; but in God’s name let its\r\nprovisions be honestly carried out; let the law be faithfully executed.\r\nLet the conduct of the public agents in Kansas not only be right, but\r\nlet it _appear to be right_. If slavery should be instituted by, or\r\nunder a slave-holding executive; and Kansas should claim admission as a\r\nslave state, it does not require a prophet to foretell the consequences\r\nnorth of Mason and Dixon’s line.\r\n\r\n“The Democratic party, which has stood by the Constitution and the\r\nrights of the South with such unflinching fidelity, would be stricken\r\ndown in the few remaining States where it is yet in the ascendancy; the\r\nbalance of power would be lost; and Black Republicans would rule this\r\nnation, or civil war, and disunion would inevitably follow.\r\n\r\n“What, then, is to be done? Will you permit me to make a suggestion? The\r\npost of honor and renown, if successfully and satisfactorily filled, at\r\nthis moment in the gift of the President, is the Governorship of Kansas.\r\nSend one of the first men of the nation there—some gentleman who enjoys\r\nthe confidence of the North and the South—and let him cover himself with\r\nglory by a fearless and a faithful discharge of the duties of his\r\nstation. Sustain him, then, with the whole power of the Government, and\r\nfollow with swift vengeance any party that dares to raise a hand against\r\nthe law or its prompt and faithful execution.\r\n\r\n“The time for trifling is past. Bold, efficient action is required. To\r\nwaver or to vacillate, is to fail. Who, then, should be appointed? If\r\nGeneral Scott would accept of the position, and if the duties are\r\ncompatible with those of the military station he now holds, I answer,\r\nappoint General Winfield Scott. He has the confidence of the nation. He\r\nis acceptable to the South, having been born and reared in Virginia; and\r\nhe is not unacceptable to the North, inasmuch as he now resides there.\r\nIf requested by the President, in view of the importance of the Mission,\r\nI do not think that he would decline. However, let some such man be\r\nappointed—some man well known to the American people, and in whom they\r\nconfide, and the result will be the same. All will be well. Otherwise I\r\ntremble for the result.”\r\n\r\nIt was during Governor Packer’s administration in 1858, that the office\r\nof superintendent of public schools was separated from that of secretary\r\nof the Commonwealth. The first state normal school was located at\r\nMillersville, Lancaster County.\r\n\r\nIn 1859 the celebrated raid into Virginia by John Brown occurred, by\r\nwhich the public property of the United States at Harper’s Ferry was\r\nseized, and the lives of citizens of that State sacrificed by that band\r\nof fanatics, who, in their mad zeal, attempted to excite the slave\r\npopulation to insurrection. The plans for this raid were perfected in\r\nChambersburg, where John Brown and his associates lived for a time,\r\nunder assumed names.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent trial and conviction of John Brown, and his followers, by\r\nno means quenched the fire of disunion which was then kindling.\r\n\r\nGovernor Packer, in his last message to the Legislature, expressed in\r\nplain terms the fearful position in which South Carolina, and the other\r\nstates preparing for similar rebellious action, had placed themselves.\r\n\r\nMutterings of the coming storm were approaching nearer and nearer and\r\nthe year 1861 opened up with a gloomy aspect. In the midst of this\r\nportentous overshadowing, Andrew G. Curtin took charge of the helm of\r\nState.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Albert Gallatin, Soldier, Statesman and\r\n                    Financier, Born January 20, 1761\r\n\r\n\r\nAlbert Gallatin was born in Geneva, Switzerland, January 20, 1761. Both\r\nof his parents were of distinguished families and died while he was an\r\ninfant. He graduated from the University of Geneva in 1779.\r\n\r\nFeeling a great sympathy for the American colonists in their struggle\r\nfor liberty, he came to Massachusetts in 1780, entered the military\r\nservice, and for a few months commanded the post at Passamaquoddy.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the war he taught French at Harvard University, where he\r\nremained until 1784, when he received his patrimonial estate. He\r\ninvested it in land in West Virginia and Western Pennsylvania, and, in\r\n1786, he settled on land on the banks of the Monongahela River, in\r\nFayette County, Pennsylvania. Here he lived and became naturalized.\r\n\r\nThe town was named New Geneva from his native place in Switzerland. Here\r\nhe built a log house, which subsequently gave place to a stone structure\r\nyet standing. He was a partner in establishing the first glass house in\r\nthat section of the State. He became one of the foremost citizens of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nHe served in the General Assembly of Pennsylvania for several terms and\r\nin 1793 was chosen a United States Senator for Pennsylvania, but was\r\ndeclared ineligible on the ground that he had not been a citizen of the\r\nUnited States the required nine years.\r\n\r\nDuring the Whisky Insurrection in Western Pennsylvania, 1794, Albert\r\nGallatin played a conspicuous role.\r\n\r\nIn the meeting of the malcontents, August 14, 1794, at Parkinson’s\r\nFerry, where 260 delegates, elected by the several counties, organized\r\nand adopted some intemperate resolutions, Colonel Edward Cook was\r\nappointed chairman, and Albert Gallatin, secretary. The organic force of\r\nthe insurrection was condensed into a committee of sixty and that\r\ncommittee was again represented by a Standing Committee of twelve.\r\n\r\nGallatin was energetic in working with his friends to gain time and\r\nrestore quietness. He presented with great force the folly of resistance\r\nand the ruinous consequences to the country of the continuance of the\r\ninsurrection. He urged that the Government was bound to vindicate the\r\nlaws and that it would surely send an overwhelming force against them.\r\nHe placed the subject in a new light and showed the insurrection to be a\r\nmuch more serious affair than it had before appeared.\r\n\r\nAfter the Pennsylvania commissioners had reached Pittsburgh and met with\r\nthose of the National Government and the committee appointed at the\r\nmeeting at Parkinson’s Ferry, a conference of the committee of sixty was\r\nheld at Redstone Old Fort, now Brownsville.\r\n\r\nThis meeting was opened by a long, sensible and eloquent speech by\r\nAlbert Gallatin in favor of law and order. Backed by Judge Hugh H.\r\nBrackenridge, Gallatin won the day, and the insurrection was happily\r\nended before the army was called into action.\r\n\r\nGallatin was censured for the part he had taken, but no man stood higher\r\nin the opinion, not only of President Washington, but of the\r\nPennsylvania authorities. In the General Assembly December, 1794, in an\r\nable speech Gallatin admitted his “political sin” in the course he had\r\ntaken in the insurrectionary movement.\r\n\r\nHe was elected to Congress in 1795, and in a debate on Jay’s Treaty in\r\n1796 he charged Washington and Jay with having pusillanimously\r\nsurrendered the honor of their country. This, from the lips of a young\r\nforeigner, exasperated the Federalists. He was a leader of the Democrats\r\nand directed his attention particularly to financial matters.\r\n\r\nGallatin remained in Congress until 1801, when President Thomas\r\nJefferson appointed him Secretary of the Treasury, which office he held\r\nuntil 1813, and obtained the credit of being one of the best financiers\r\nof the age.\r\n\r\nThe opponents of Jefferson’s Administration complained vehemently in\r\n1808 that the country was threatened with direct taxation at a time when\r\nthe sources of its wealth, by the orders and decrees of Great Britain\r\nand France, were drying up. Gallatin replied to these complaints, as\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, by reproducing a flattering but delusive\r\nsuggestion contained in his annual report the preceding year.\r\n\r\nHe suggested that as the United States was not likely to be involved in\r\nfrequent wars, a revenue derived solely from duties on imports, even\r\nthough liable to diminution during war, would yet amply suffice to pay\r\noff, during long intervals of peace, the expenses of such wars as might\r\nbe undertaken.\r\n\r\nShould the United States become involved in war with both France and\r\nGreat Britain, no internal taxes would be necessary to carry it on, nor\r\nany other financial expedient, beyond borrowing money and doubling the\r\nduties on import. The scheme, afterwards tried, bore bitter fruit.\r\n\r\nHis influence was felt in other departments of Government and in the\r\npolitics of the country. Opposed to going to war against Great Britain\r\nin 1812, he exerted all his influence to avert it.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1813, he was appointed one of the envoys to Russia to\r\nnegotiate for the mediation of the Czar between the United States and\r\nGreat Britain. He sailed for St. Petersburg, but the Senate in special\r\nsessions, refused to ratify his appointment because he was Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury. The attempt at mediation was unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nWhen, in January, 1814, Great Britain proposed a direct negotiation for\r\npeace, Gallatin, who was still abroad, was appointed one of the United\r\nStates Commissioners. He resigned his secretaryship. He was one of the\r\nsigners of the Treaty of Ghent.\r\n\r\nIn 1815 he was appointed Minister to France, where he remained until\r\n1823. He refused a seat in the Cabinet of President Monroe on his return\r\nand also declined to be a candidate for Vice President to which the\r\ndominant Democratic Party nominated him.\r\n\r\nPresident Adams appointed him Minister to Great Britain, where he\r\nnegotiated several important commercial conventions.\r\n\r\nReturning to America in 1827, he took up his residence in New York City.\r\nThere he was engaged in public service in various ways until 1839, when\r\nhe withdrew from public duties and directed the remainder of his life to\r\nliterary pursuits.\r\n\r\nAlthough strictly in private life, Gallatin took special interest in the\r\nprogress of the country, and wrote much on the subject. His published\r\nworks include such subjects as finance, politics and ethnology.\r\n\r\nMr. Gallatin was chief founder, in 1842, and the first president of the\r\nAmerican Ethnological Society, and was president of the New York\r\nHistorical Society from 1843 until his death, August 12, 1849, at\r\nAstoria, L. I.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               General Thomas Mifflin, Soldier, Statesman\r\n                    and Several Times Governor, Died\r\n                            January 21, 1800\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the venerable Franklin was about to step aside as the President of\r\nthe Council and withdraw from public employment, the people of\r\nPennsylvania became concerned in the successor to so brilliant a man.\r\nThe choice fell upon Thomas Mifflin, and he occupied the enviable\r\nposition of Chief Executive of the Commonwealth longer than any other\r\nPennsylvanian, two years as President of the Council and three times\r\nGovernor, an aggregate of eleven years.\r\n\r\nThomas Mifflin was the son of Quaker parents, and was born in\r\nPhiladelphia in 1744. He was educated in the Philadelphia College, and\r\nhis parents intended that Thomas should follow a mercantile profession.\r\nUpon the completion of his college course he entered the counting house\r\nof William Coleman. At the age of twenty-one he made a tour of Europe\r\nand then entered into a business partnership with his brother in\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\nIn 1772 he was elected one of the two members of the Legislature from\r\nthe City of Philadelphia, and was re-elected the following year, when he\r\nwas the colleague of Franklin, then just returned from his mission to\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nSo conspicuous were his services in the Assembly, that when the\r\nappointment of delegates to the first Continental Congress came to be\r\nmade, Mifflin was selected as one, and he occupied a position of\r\ncommanding influence.\r\n\r\n“When the news,” says Dr. Rawle, his biographer, “of the battle of\r\nLexington reached Philadelphia, a town meeting was called and the fellow\r\ncitizens of Mifflin were delighted by his animated oratory.” None did\r\nmore than he to arouse the populace to a sense of the danger which\r\nthreatened. He did not only exhort, but he put in practice his pleading.\r\nWhen the troops were to be enlisted and drilled, Mifflin was among the\r\nforemost to train them, and was selected as a major in one of the\r\nearliest formed regiments.\r\n\r\nThe patriot blood spilled at Lexington and Concord fired a martial\r\nspirit throughout America by which the bold leaders in every State were\r\nnerved to resist and resent those unprovoked assaults, and when\r\nWashington appeared at the camp in Boston as the Commander-in-Chief of\r\nthe American armies, Mifflin was by his side.\r\n\r\nRecognizing his great personal popularity, the ease and dignity of his\r\nmanners, breadth and soundness of his views, Washington placed Mifflin\r\nat the head of his military family. In the absence of, or at the\r\nretirement from the table of the chief it fell upon Mifflin to occupy\r\nhis place and do the honors; and for this duty, by his social position\r\nat home and his foreign travel he was admirably fitted. Colonel Mifflin\r\nwas the first person in America who officiated as aide-de-camp.\r\n\r\nWhen Washington, July, 1775, organized the entire army, the difficult\r\nposition of quartermaster general was assigned to Mifflin. The duties\r\nwere new and arduous. Everything was in chaos. Order had to be\r\nestablished and system inaugurated.\r\n\r\nOn May 19, 1776, Congress appointed and commissioned Mifflin to be a\r\nbrigadier general and he was given command of Pennsylvania troops. An\r\nassignment to the active field was much more to his liking than one at\r\nheadquarters.\r\n\r\nUpon taking the field Mifflin was relieved as quartermaster general by\r\nGeneral Stephen Moylan, who was ill suited to the difficult task of\r\nproviding for an army where the authority for calling in supplies was\r\nlittle respected and the means of paying for them was rarely in hand;\r\nand not long after accepting the position he abandoned it.\r\n\r\nCongress called upon Mifflin to again assume the duties of quartermaster\r\ngeneral and he reluctantly responded to the call of his country, deeming\r\nit a matter of duty.\r\n\r\nThe reverses of the American Army during the summer and fall of 1776\r\nculminated in its withdrawal into New Jersey, hotly pursued by the\r\nBritish troops. Pennsylvania was threatened and especially Philadelphia,\r\nwhere Congress was sitting. At this dark hour Mifflin was sent with\r\ndispatches from Washington to Congress, calling on that body loudly for\r\nhelp.\r\n\r\nMifflin, at the request of Congress, made a stirring address, setting\r\nforth the perilous situation, and appealing for the means to oppose the\r\nfurther advance of the defiant enemy. That body was greatly exercised\r\nand ordered that General Mifflin should remain near Congress for\r\nconsultation and advice.\r\n\r\nAs the enemy pressed toward Philadelphia, General Putnam was sent to\r\ntake command in the city and General Mifflin was placed in charge of the\r\nwar material and stores.\r\n\r\nThe victory at Trenton produced a gleam of hope and Congress dispatched\r\nMifflin throughout the State of Pennsylvania in order that, by his\r\npersonal appeals, volunteers might be drawn to the support of\r\nWashington’s decimated ranks. He caused large numbers to enlist.\r\n\r\nMifflin was mixed up in the “Conway Cabal,” but in after years he\r\nexplained his position, and it would seem to prove the intensity of his\r\ndevotion to the struggle in which he had staked fortune and life itself.\r\n\r\nIn 1783 General Mifflin was elected a member of Congress, and had the\r\nsatisfaction of being President of that body, when General Washington,\r\nDecember 23, 1783, resigned his commission into its hands. Mifflin made\r\nan eloquent reply.\r\n\r\nGeneral Mifflin was a member of the Assembly of Pennsylvania which met\r\nin 1785; also of the convention which sat in 1787 and framed the\r\nConstitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn 1788 he was chosen a member of the Supreme Executive Council, and\r\nupon the retirement of Franklin, he was elected President.\r\n\r\nGeneral Mifflin was the president of the convention that framed the\r\nState Constitution of 1790, and he and General Arthur St. Clair were the\r\ntwo candidates for Governor. Mifflin triumphed and was continued in\r\noffice for that and the two succeeding terms.\r\n\r\nGovernor Mifflin was very efficient in quelling the Whisky Insurrection\r\nof 1794, and personally commanded the troops from Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nHis last official communication as Governor was made December 7, 1799.\r\nIt contained his farewell sentiments on taking leave of office and was\r\nreceived with every manifestation of respect by the Assembly.\r\n\r\nHe was elected to the Assembly and took his seat, but did not long\r\nsurvive. He died during a session of the House, then sitting in\r\nLancaster, on January 21, 1800. His decease was noticed with becoming\r\nceremonies, resolutions being adopted expressive of the high sense\r\nentertained for him as a soldier and statesman, authorizing his\r\ninterment at the public expense and providing for the erection of a\r\nmonument to his memory.\r\n\r\n“Thus ended,” says Dr. Rawle, “the checkered life of Thomas\r\nMifflin—brilliant in its outset—troubled and perplexed at a period more\r\nadvanced—again distinguished, prosperous and happy—finally clouded by\r\npoverty and oppressed by creditors. In patriotic principle never\r\nchanging—in public action never faltering—in personal friendship\r\nsincerely warm—in relieving the distressed always active and humane—in\r\nhis own affairs improvident—in the business of others scrupulously\r\njust.”\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Story of the Old Log College and the\r\n                     Reverend Charles Beatty, Born\r\n                            January 22, 1715\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pioneer seminary for aspirants to the Presbyterian ministry nearly\r\ntwo hundred years ago, was long known as “The Old Log College.” It stood\r\nat Neshaminy in Warwick Township, Bucks County.\r\n\r\nWhen the celebrated evangelist George Whitefield came to America in\r\n1739, he preached here to three thousand persons.\r\n\r\nThe deed for the land upon which this early educational institution was\r\nbuilt, was dated 1728, and was given by Hon. James Logan, the secretary\r\nof the Province and one of the most illustrious of the early officials\r\nof Pennsylvania, to his cousin, Reverend William Tennent, an Irish\r\nemigrant, who shortly after his arrival in America renounced his\r\nallegiance to the Church of England and united with the Philadelphia\r\nPresbytery.\r\n\r\nThe gift consisted of fifty acres of land and the part of it on which\r\nthe college stood is believed to have been an ancient Indian burying\r\nground. The log college, twenty feet by thirty feet in size, was for\r\nmany years the only institute south of New England where young men could\r\nbe prepared for the ministry.\r\n\r\nThe Log College flourished under Mr. Tennent for twenty years, when its\r\nplace was eminently supplied by kindred institutions thereabouts. From\r\nits walls came many noted preachers of Scotch-Irish descent, among them\r\nfour of his own sons. One of the latter, Gilbert Tennent, preached most\r\neloquently to stir up patriotism during the French and Indian War.\r\n\r\nIt is said that a carload of these sermons were very opportunely\r\ndiscovered in an old lumber room of Dr. Benjamin Franklin’s when the\r\nAmerican patriots were hunting for paper to make cartridges, after the\r\nBritish evacuated Philadelphia, June 17, 1778. The sermons were utilized\r\nas cases for cartridges, and told effectively afterwards on the\r\nretreating British in the battle of Monmouth. Thus these eloquent\r\nsermons served the country in two great wars, more than is usually the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Charles Beatty, an Irish Presbyterian, who was chaplain\r\nwith Colonel Benjamin Franklin in his army on the Lehigh and later with\r\nColonel William Clapham in his regiment which marched to Fort Augusta at\r\nthe Forks of the Susquehanna, was a student here.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Mr. Beatty was the son of an officer in the British Army, and\r\nwas born in Ireland, January 22, 1715. He obtained a fairly accurate\r\nclassical education in his own country and when he emigrated to America\r\nin 1740, his circumstances being meager, he employed several of the\r\nfirst years of his residence as a peddler.\r\n\r\nHe halted one day at the Log College, where he addressed the Reverend\r\nWilliam Tennent familiarly in correct and classical Latin. After some\r\nconversation in which the peddler manifested much piety and considerable\r\nreligious zeal, Tennent said, “Go and sell the contents of your pack,\r\nand return immediately and study with me. It will be a sin for you to\r\ncontinue a peddler, when you can be so much more useful in another\r\nprofession.”\r\n\r\nBeatty accepted Tennent’s offer, became an eminent preacher, and\r\nsucceeded his preceptor, as head of the Log College. He was ordained in\r\nthe Presbyterian Ministry, December 1, 1743, and passed most of his life\r\nin charge of “ye congregation of Warwick, in ye forks of the Neshaminy.”\r\n\r\nAn interesting incident is related of his military service. The soldiers\r\nwere issued a gill of rum each day in addition to their regular\r\nstipulation, one-half being dealt out in the morning and the balance in\r\nthe evening.\r\n\r\nChaplain Beatty complained to Colonel Franklin that the soldiers were\r\nnot punctual in attending divine service, when Franklin suggested, “It\r\nis, perhaps, below the dignity of your profession to act as a steward of\r\nthe rum, but if you were to distribute it out only just after prayers,\r\nyou would have them all about you.”\r\n\r\nMr. Beatty profited by the advice and in the future had no reason to\r\ncomplain of non-attendance. A few hands regularly measured out the\r\nliquor after prayers.\r\n\r\nWhen Colonel William Clapham was detached from Franklin’s command and\r\nordered to recruit a regiment to build Fort Augusta, he selected Beatty\r\nas the chaplain of the regiment. He kept an interesting journal of this\r\ntour of duty, of which the following is the first paragraph:\r\n\r\n“Having received his honor, the Governor’s commission to be chaplain to\r\nthe regiment of foot in the provincial service under the command of\r\nColonel William Clapham, and having the advice and concurrence of the\r\nCommission of the Synod, who appointed supplies for the congregation in\r\nmy absence—set out from home in order to join the regiment at Harris’\r\nFerry, Monday, May 3, 1756. I was accompanied as far as Schuylkill by my\r\nelders and some other friends, and having stopped at a friend’s house,\r\nnot far from the road to refresh myself, reached as far as the Sign of\r\nthe Ship on the Lancaster road, at which I lodged. Felt my need of the\r\nDivine Presence to be with me in my dangerous or at least difficult\r\nundertaking.”\r\n\r\nHe reached Lancaster the following afternoon, where he was met by\r\nColonel Clapham and Captain Thomas Lloyd, who advised him that Governor\r\nMorris was in town. They called on His Excellency, who received them\r\nvery kindly.\r\n\r\nThey all set out the following morning for Harris’ Ferry, arrived at\r\nBarney Hughes’ hotel in time for dinner and reached Harris’ Ferry in the\r\nevening, when the soldiers were ordered to assemble for prayer and to\r\nmeet their distinguished guests.\r\n\r\nJust as the assembly call sounded, a fire broke out in John Harris’\r\nhouse and there were no prayers.\r\n\r\nHe frequently lamented in his well-kept journal, that some trifling\r\nincident prevented officers or men, or both, from attending prayer.\r\n“Just as service began in the afternoon, had an alarm, but few, alas,\r\nseemed to regret the disappointment. Wickedness seems to increase in the\r\ncamp, which gives me a great deal of uneasiness.”\r\n\r\nThe following Sunday, “One of the bateaux which had on it a cannon was\r\nupset, which occasioned a great deal of labor, and what profane swearing\r\nthere was. If I stay in the camp my ears are greeted with profane oaths,\r\nand if I go out to shun it, I am in danger of the enemy—what a dilemma\r\nis this? But my eyes would be toward the Lord.”\r\n\r\nIn 1766 he was appointed, with the Rev. George Duffield, missionary to\r\nthe frontier settlements in the new purchase and to the Indians of the\r\nOhio River. He died August 12, 1772, at Barbados whither he had gone to\r\ncollect money for the New Jersey College, which is now Princeton\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Philip Fithian, who traveled through Central Pennsylvania in\r\n1775, and who kept such an interesting journal of his experiences, was a\r\nson-in-law of the Rev. Charles Beatty.[1]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  Reverend Charles Beatty had four sons, all officers in the Continental\r\n  Army; John, who rose to the rank of colonel, and after the Revolution\r\n  became a brigadier-general in the militia; Charles Clinton, a\r\n  lieutenant, who was accidentally killed when another soldier of his\r\n  command shot him while carelessly handling a pistol; Reading, a\r\n  surgeon; and Eukuries, a lieutenant and paymaster, who continued long\r\n  in the military service of his country after the Revolution, and was a\r\n  major during the Indian campaign of 1788–1792.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                -------\r\n\r\n                Militia Organized at Provincial Council\r\n                        Meeting January 23, 1775\r\n\r\n\r\nA Provincial Convention was held in Philadelphia, January 23, 1775,\r\nwhich lasted six days. At the organization of the convention, General\r\nJoseph Reed was chosen chairman.\r\n\r\nStrong resolutions were adopted, heartily approving the conduct and\r\nproceedings of the Continental Congress; opposing future importation of\r\nslaves into this Province; protecting members of committees of Congress\r\nfrom embarrassment on account of this service, and one, “That in case\r\nthe trade of the city and liberties of Philadelphia shall be suspended\r\nin consequence of the present struggle, it is the opinion of this\r\nconvention that the several counties should, and that the members of\r\nthis convention will exert themselves to afford the necessary relief and\r\nassistance to the inhabitants of the said city and liberties; who will\r\nbe more immediately affected by such an event.”\r\n\r\nThis convention also adopted a lengthy resolution which tended toward\r\nthe regulation of the supply and consumption of foodstuffs, and the\r\nnecessities of life, especially such as had been regulated by laws of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThe crisis to which the convention looked forward when framing these\r\nresolutions had arrived. The battle of Lexington had been fought and\r\nsubmission to the arbitrary acts of Parliament was attempted to be\r\nenforced by the bayonet. Soon as the news of this battle spread\r\nmultitudes of men, at the suggestion of the county committees of\r\nobservation, entered into an association for defense.\r\n\r\nThe officers of these organizations were generally men of unusual\r\nmilitary skill, men who were veterans of several campaigns and some of\r\ninnumerable Indian incursions. This was not as generally true of the\r\nolder portion of the Province. This had been peaceable, and remote from\r\nthe frontiers, so the chief officers in these countries were frequently\r\nwithout military experience, who owed their preferment to political\r\nactivity, or social prominence.\r\n\r\nDickinson accepted the colonelcy of the first battalion, while the\r\nothers raised in the City of Philadelphia were commanded by Daniel\r\nRoderdeau, merchant and politician; John Cadwallader, a shopkeeper, son\r\nof one of the Governor’s Council; Thomas McKean, lawyer and lately\r\nSpeaker of the Delaware Assembly, and Timothy Matlack, politician.\r\n\r\nThe colonels of the six battalions raised in Philadelphia County, which\r\nthen included what is now Montgomery County were: William Hamilton,\r\nRobert Lewis, Thomas Potts, Samuel Miles, a veteran of French and Indian\r\nWar, and Hill Tench Francis, brother of Colonel Turbutt Francis, also a\r\nhero of the French and Indian War, sons of the deceased Attorney General\r\nTench Francis. The colonels from the other counties were:\r\n\r\nBucks County—Joseph Kirkbride, Joseph Hart, Andrew Kachlein and Arthur\r\nErwin.\r\n\r\nChester County—James Moore, Thomas Hockley, Hugh Lloyd, William\r\nMontgomery and Richard Thomas.\r\n\r\nLancaster—George Ross, Matthias Slough, Curtis Grubb, Thomas Porter,\r\nJohn Ferree, James Burd, hero of the French and Indian War and of many\r\nother campaigns; Peter Grubb and Bartram Galbraith.\r\n\r\nYork County—Robert Callender, William Thompson, John Montgomery and\r\nJames Wilson.\r\n\r\nBerks County—Edward Biddle, Mark Bird, Daniel Brodhead, veteran of the\r\nFrench and Indian War; Balzer Geehr and Christian Louer.\r\n\r\nNorthampton County—George Taylor, Henry Geiger, Yost Dreisbach and Jacob\r\nStroud.\r\n\r\nBedford County—Bernard Dougherty and Samuel Davidson.\r\n\r\nNorthumberland County—Samuel Hunter, James Potter and William Plunket,\r\neach a hero of the French and Indian War and thoroughly trained as\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nWestmoreland County—John Proctor and John Cornahan.\r\n\r\nTo assist in carrying into effect the many measures passed for the\r\ndefense of the province, the Assembly on June 30, appointed a Committee\r\nof Safety, consisting of ten from City of Philadelphia, four from the\r\ncounty and one from each of the other counties excepting Chester, which\r\nhad two members.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Franklin was chosen president of the committee at its first\r\nmeeting, July 3, 1775; William Garrett was named clerk and Michael\r\nHillegas treasurer.\r\n\r\nThe several County Commissioners were asked to purchase a specified\r\nnumber of guns with bayonets, cartridge boxes with twenty-three rounds\r\nof cartridges and knapsacks.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly offered £20 for every hundredweight of saltpeter\r\nmanufactured in the province within the next three months.\r\n\r\nAmong the first labors of the Committee of Safety was that of preparing\r\narticles for the government of the military organizations known as\r\nAssociators. A set of resolutions to that effect were adopted August 19,\r\nwhich included every possible phase of a soldier’s life, including his\r\npersonal appearance, conduct, sobriety, loyalty, demeanor as an officer,\r\nnoncommissioned officer or private, etc.\r\n\r\nMany of the citizens refused to subscribe to the regulations, alleging\r\nthat numerous persons, rich and able to perform military duty claimed\r\nexemption under pretense of conscientious scruples and asserting that\r\nwhere liberty of all was at stake, all should aid in its defense, and\r\nthat where the cause was common to all, it was inconsistent with justice\r\nand equity that the burden should be partial.\r\n\r\nThe Friends addressed the Legislature, setting forth their religious\r\nfaith and practice with respect to bearing arms, and claiming exemption\r\nfrom military service by virtue of laws agreed upon in England and the\r\nCharter of William Penn. The Mennonites and German Baptists also\r\nremonstrated, praying exemption, but willing to contribute pecuniary\r\naid.\r\n\r\nAssembly resolved that “all persons between the ages of sixteen and\r\nfifty capable of bearing arms, who do not associate for the defense of\r\nthe Province, ought to contribute an equivalent for the time spent by\r\nthe associators in acquiring military discipline; ministers of the\r\ngospel of all denominations and servants purchased bona fide for\r\nvaluable consideration only excepted.”\r\n\r\nReturns were required from the assessors of all persons within military\r\nage, and the captains of the companies of the Associators were directed\r\nto furnish to their colonels and the colonels to the County\r\nCommissioners lists of such persons as had joined the Associators. The\r\ncommissioners were empowered to assess those not associated £2 10s\r\nannually, in addition to the ordinary tax.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly also adopted rules and regulations for the better\r\ngovernment of the military association, the thirty-fifth article of\r\nwhich provided “that if any associator called into actual service should\r\nleave a family not of ability to maintain themselves in his absence, the\r\njustices of the peace of the proper city or county, with the overseer of\r\nthe poor, should make provisions for their maintenance.”\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Captain Thomas McKee, Indian Trader,\r\n                    Makes Deposition Before Governor\r\n                            January 24, 1743\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas McKee was the most noted of the later Shamokin Traders, and we\r\nhave records of his trading expeditions as far west as the Ohio.\r\n\r\nHis career was highly romantic, and a consideration of the same will\r\nenable us to understand his son, Captain Alexander McKee, who afterwards\r\nbecame well-known at Fort Pitt, and rendered himself notorious in border\r\nhistory by deserting to the British during the time of the Revolutionary\r\nWar, carrying over to that interest a great many Indians whom he had\r\nbefriended during his service as Deputy Indian Agent under the Crown. We\r\nwill then know better why he should seek more congenial company among\r\nthe Ohio Indians and in the service of the King, than he had found among\r\nthe American forces at Fort Pitt, who were enemies of both.\r\n\r\nDr. W. H. Egle has stated that Thomas McKee was a son of Patrick, but it\r\nis quite possible that he was the son of one Alexander McKee who died in\r\nDonegal Township, Lancaster County, in May, 1740, leaving a son, Thomas,\r\nwho was the executor of his will.\r\n\r\nA contributor to Dr. Egle’s “Notes and Queries” relates a traditionary\r\naccount of Thomas McKee’s marriage, which had been told to him in his\r\nboyhood days by his father, a native of the Susquehanna Valley. This\r\nstory was to the effect that Thomas McKee, in his early manhood began\r\ntrading with the Indians, and after learning the language of the\r\nDelaware, established a trading post among them, in the vicinity of\r\nShamokin (now Sunbury), at or near the Forks of the Susquehanna.\r\n\r\nIn the performance of this enterprise while he was on a trading\r\nexpedition farther up the West Branch, he ventured into the camp of\r\nstrange Indians, who stole his goods, drank his rum, and then becoming\r\nincensed at the resistance he made to their proceedings, bound him as a\r\ncaptive, and decided to burn him at the stake the following day.\r\n\r\nDuring the night, an Indian maiden came to the wigwam where he lay bound\r\nto a log. She released him, and they fled together, making their escape.\r\nMcKee from gratitude, made the girl his squaw and they lived together\r\nduring the remainder of their lives as husband and wife.\r\n\r\nEdward Shippen, of Lancaster, wrote to Governor Morris April 19, 1756,\r\nafter a visit to Captain McKee’s fort, where he found ten Indians, among\r\nthem John Shikellamy. He adds; “Shikellamy let me know that he wished\r\nthe Indians would be moved down to Barney Hughes, where Captain McKee’s\r\nwoman and children live.”\r\n\r\nIn a conference between Sir William Johnson and Canaghquiesa, an Oneida\r\nchief, the latter reported on his mission to the hostile Shawnee of\r\nNorthern Pennsylvania. He advised Sir William that one who lived near\r\nthose Indians had applied to the Delaware to accompany them to the\r\nproposed meeting at Onondaga, which they refused to do, saying that “One\r\nThomas McGee, who lives on the Susquehanna and is married to a Shawnese\r\nsquaw, had told them that in ten days’ time an army of the English would\r\ncome and destroy them.”\r\n\r\nThe Moravian Bishop, Cammerhoff, visited Captain Thomas McKee’s trading\r\npost in 1748. In his journal he writes under date of January 13:\r\n\r\n“We have before us twenty long miles to Shamokin, also two bad creeks\r\nand the narrowest passes along the river to pass. At 9 o’clock we\r\nreached Thomas McKee’s, the last white settlement on the river, below\r\nShamokin.”\r\n\r\nThis trading post was at the site of the present village of Dalmatia,\r\nNorthumberland County. His other post at this time was below the mouth\r\nof the Juniata, not far distant from Big (now Haldeman’s) Island. Both\r\nthese trading posts are shown on Scull’s map of 1759.\r\n\r\nThe bishop further wrote in his journal: “McKee holds a captain’s\r\ncommission under the Government, is an extensive Indian trader, bears a\r\ngood name among them and drives a brisk trade with the Allegheny\r\ncountry. His wife, who was brought up among the Indians, speaks but\r\nlittle English. They received us with much kindness and hospitality.”\r\n\r\nThomas McKee’s “woman,” “squaw” or “wife” as referred to by Edward\r\nShippen, Chief Canaghquiesa and Bishop Cammerhoff, respectively, may\r\nhave been the same who assisted him to escape from the unfriendly party\r\nof Indians in the early winter of 1743. The details of that adventure\r\nare set forth in an affidavit which McKee made before Governor Thomas in\r\nPhiladelphia, January 24, 1743.\r\n\r\nIn this deposition McKee states he had a store near the Big Island, and\r\nthat “on the 12th or 13th of this instant, January, about 7 o’clock in\r\nthe morning, the Indians of the town came to the deponent’s store and\r\ntold him they had heard the Dead Halloa and were much surprised at it.\r\nWhereupon he, with a servant of his, took a canoe and went over to the\r\nisland, and in his passage heard the Indians belonging to the town call\r\nover to those on the island. To which they answered that the white men\r\nhad killed some of their men. A council was called, and this deponent\r\nattended at the Council House and was admitted.”\r\n\r\nAt the council the leader of the Iroquois war band informed the Shawnee\r\nof an attack made upon their war expedition in Virginia, in which four\r\nIndians were killed.\r\n\r\nMcKee addressed the council, reminding them that these disorders had not\r\nhappened in Pennsylvania, and urged them to press in their council a\r\ntreaty of peace with Pennsylvania. The Shawnee did not receive the\r\nsuggestion kindly. A short time after McKee was informed by a white\r\nwoman, who had been taken prisoner, that it was left with the Shawnee to\r\ndeal with him as they pleased and that they were going to hold a council\r\nconcerning him at some distance from the town, and that if he did not\r\nescape he would certainly be cut off.\r\n\r\nMcKee realized the advice was timely and, with his servant, they\r\ndeparted, leaving all his goods behind. The two traveled three days and\r\nthree nights before they believed themselves out of danger.\r\n\r\nCaptain Thomas McKee was in command at Fort Hunter in 1756. He died near\r\nMcKee’s Half Falls, on the eastern side of the Susquehanna, in 1772,\r\nleaving two sons, Alexander and James. The former was then at Fort Pitt\r\nas an assistant to George Croghan, the deputy Indian agent for the\r\nCrown, and where he owned a large tract of land at the mouth of the\r\nChartiers Creek, including McKee’s Rock, still a noted landmark on the\r\nOhio River, just below Pittsburgh. When he deserted from the garrison at\r\nFort Pitt and joined the British in 1777 his possessions in Pennsylvania\r\npassed to his brother, whose descendants are still living in Allegheny\r\nCounty.\r\n\r\nIf the woman Captain Thomas McKee had made his wife was the white\r\ncaptive of the Shawnee, who had been adopted into their tribe, it is not\r\nhard to understand why her son, Alexander the renegade, should have\r\ninherited a half-savage nature. This would be even more true if his\r\nmother was a Shawnee squaw. His adherence to the British Government when\r\nthe Revolution came, a government which had so long been his paymaster,\r\nis less to be wondered at than his temporary defection therefrom during\r\nthe first two years of the struggle.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Work Commenced on Erection of Fort\r\n                         Henry January 25, 1756\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Provincial authorities in 1755 sent Colonel Benjamin Franklin and\r\nothers to erect a chain of forts, about ten or twelve miles apart,\r\nstretching in a line from the Delaware to the Susquehanna River.\r\n\r\nThe principal fort on the Lehigh River was Fort Allen, where the town of\r\nWeissport, Carbon County, now stands. Fort Swatara was the principal\r\nfort on the end of the chain as it approached the Susquehanna, although\r\nFort Hunter was situated on the east bank of that river, about six miles\r\nabove the present City of Harrisburg.\r\n\r\nFourteen miles east of Fort Swatara was erected Fort Henry, and it soon\r\nbecame the most important place of defense between the two great rivers\r\nin this chain of forts.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes referred to as Busse’s Fort, in honor of Captain\r\nChristian Busse, who commanded the garrison there during its most active\r\nperiod. It was frequently referred to as the “Fort at Deitrick Six’s,”\r\nbecause of the Indian atrocities which occurred there and which had much\r\nto do with the decision to erect the fort on part of Six’s farm.\r\n\r\nFort Henry was situated on the main road to Shamokin (now Sunbury),\r\nwhere Fort Augusta commanded the forks of the Susquehanna, and protected\r\nthe settlers resident on both the north and west branches of that river.\r\n\r\nThere was no town in the vicinity of Fort Henry, nor did it guard any\r\nmountain pass or prominent stream, but it did command the connecting\r\nhighways between the Swatara Creek and the settlements near that stream.\r\nThe Indians were obliged to pass through Talihaio Gap to reach any of\r\nthe white settlements in that region.\r\n\r\nThe history of Fort Henry really begins with the attack from ambush made\r\non a company of six settlers traveling to Deitrick Six’s, Saturday\r\nafternoon, November 15, 1755.\r\n\r\nNone was killed in the first attack, but as the terrified settlers\r\nhastened toward a watch-house, a half mile distant, they were overtaken\r\nby the savages and three of them killed and scalped, and one Indian was\r\nkilled. During the late afternoon three other settlers were killed and\r\nthree wounded.\r\n\r\nThe Indians remained in the neighborhood and the following night killed\r\na servant of Thomas Bower and set fire to his house and barn.\r\n\r\nConrad Weiser informed Governor Morris of this tragic affair in a long\r\nletter and related this and many other incursions made by the Indians in\r\nthe region now embraced by Berks, Lebanon, Dauphin, and part of\r\nNorthumberland Counties. Weiser concluded his letter as follows:\r\n\r\n“The Fire alarmed a neighbor, who came with two or three more Men; they\r\nfired by the way and made a great noise, scared the Indians away from\r\nBower’s House, after they had set fire to it, but by Thomas Bower’s\r\nDiligence and Conduct was timely put out again. So, Thos. Bower, with\r\nhis Family, went off that night to his Neighbor Daniel Schneider, who\r\ncame to his assistance. By 8 of ye Clock Parties came up from\r\nTulpenhacon & Heidleberg.\r\n\r\n“The first Party saw four Indians running off. They had some prisoners,\r\nwhom they scalped immediately; three children lay scalped, yet alive,\r\none died since, the other two are like to do well. Another Party found a\r\nwoman just expired, with a Male Child by her side, both killed and\r\nScalped. The Woman lay upon her Face, my son Frederick turned her about\r\nto see who she might have been and to his and his companions Surprize\r\nthey found a Babe of about 14 Days old under her, and life was yet in\r\nit, and recovered again.\r\n\r\n“Upon the whole, there is about 15 killed of our People, Including Men,\r\nWomen and Children, and the Enemy not beat but scared off. Several\r\nHouses and Barns are Burned; I have no true account how many. We are in\r\na dismal Situation, some of this Murder has been committed in\r\nTulpenhacon Township. The People left their Plantation to within 6 or 7\r\nmiles of my house (which was located at the present town of Womelsdorf)\r\nagainst another attack.\r\n\r\n“Guns and Ammunition is very much wanted here. My Sons have been obliged\r\nto part with most of what was sent for the use of the Indians. I pray\r\nyour Honour will be pleased, if it lies in your Power, to send us up a\r\nQuantity upon any Condition. I must stand my Ground or my Neighbours\r\nwill all go away, and leave their Habitations to be destroyed by the\r\nEnemy or our own People. This enough of such melancholy Account for\r\nthis.”\r\n\r\nConrad Weiser had been on a mission to the seat of government, to which\r\nplace he had escorted a band of friendly Indians, and it was on his\r\nreturn that he learned of the terrible murders. In fact, the trusted\r\nchief Scarouady, also known as the Half-King, and a company of Delaware\r\nwere still with him at his home when his sons recited the melancholy\r\nnews.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be wondered that many of the settlers did not fully\r\nunderstand the exact position which Colonel Weiser held, both toward the\r\nProvincial Government and towards the Indians. Both had implicit faith\r\nand confidence in him. The angry settlers were so incensed at Weiser\r\nthat had not the smoke of fire along the mountain scared them off he\r\nmight have paid the price of his friendship toward the Indians with his\r\nown life.\r\n\r\nThese atrocities decided the position of Fort Henry, and January 25,\r\n1756, Captain Christian Busse, with a company of fifty provincial\r\nsoldiers, reported there and began the erection of a fort. Governor\r\nMorris advised Governor Dinwiddie, of Virginia, and Colonel George\r\nWashington that he had ordered Fort Henry built at this important place.\r\n\r\nIt was at Fort Henry where Colonel Weiser held his councils with the\r\nofficers of the other forts and planned the protection of the farmers\r\nduring harvest, etc.\r\n\r\nDuring June, 1756, Fort Henry was honored by a visit from Governor\r\nMorris, which was occasioned by a threatened attack by the French on\r\nFort Augusta, and at a time when the terms of enlistment of many men had\r\nexpired.\r\n\r\nThe Governor directed the movement of troops to the larger fortresses.\r\nMore than fifty of the inhabitants called at Fort Henry and laid their\r\ngrievances before the Governor in person.\r\n\r\nSoon after this visit the Indians committed many murders. Five children\r\nwere carried off in one day and a sick man was slain in his bed. His\r\ndaughter, hidden under a bed in the adjoining room, saw her father\r\nkilled. Two other families were destroyed.\r\n\r\nA French deserter was captured and held at Fort Henry. He was taken to\r\nWeiser’s home, and put through the third degree. He proved to be quite\r\nclever and nothing of value was learned. He was a lad of seventeen and\r\nhad been sent from Fort Machault, on the Allegheny River, on a marauding\r\nexpedition in command of thirty-three Indians, when he accidentally got\r\nlost in the mountains and he approached the sentry at Fort Henry, as he\r\nhad been seven days without food.\r\n\r\nJune 19, 1757, the Indians carried away the wife of John Frantz and\r\nthree of their children, who lived only six miles from Fort Henry.\r\n\r\nThe actual history of Fort Henry, except for the incidents recorded\r\nhere, was one of routine military work, but it remained a garrisoned\r\nfortification for some years, surely until the summer of 1763, for at\r\nthat time Governor Hamilton wrote to Colonel John Armstrong about\r\ndisposition of troops for Lancaster, Berks and Northampton Counties, and\r\nmentioned Fort Henry as one of the chain of forts then occupied by\r\nprovincial troops.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              James Trimble, First Deputy Secretary of the\r\n                Commonwealth, Public Servant Sixty-seven\r\n                      Years, Died January 26, 1837\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen James Trimble died at his home in Harrisburg, January 26, 1837, he\r\nclosed a record of sixty-seven years service as an official of\r\nPennsylvania, a record which none other has ever approached.\r\n\r\nAnother unusual feature of this record is the fact that Mr. Trimble was\r\nthe first Deputy Secretary of the Commonwealth, beginning his service as\r\nsuch March 6, 1777, and being the only occupant of that important office\r\nuntil his death, nearly sixty years afterwards.\r\n\r\nJames Trimble was born in Philadelphia, July 19, 1755. His father,\r\nAlexander Trimble, emigrated from the North of Ireland; was a\r\nProtestant, and soon became a member of the Second Presbyterian Church\r\nof Philadelphia, then under the care of Reverend Gilbert Tennent, of\r\nwhom it is believed he was a relative.\r\n\r\nAlexander Trimble was married to Eleanor Rogers, of Abington, June 20,\r\n1754. Alexander died about 1769.\r\n\r\nJames was the eldest of several children, and though only a lad at the\r\ntime of his father’s death, he manifested all those qualities of mind\r\nand heart for which he was so justly noted throughout a long life\r\ndevoted to the service of his country.\r\n\r\nWhen his mother was left a widow with a store, James assisted her in the\r\nconduct of the business.\r\n\r\nOne day James Tilghman, Secretary of the Land Office under the\r\nProprietaries, called at the Trimble store and made some purchases.\r\nYoung Trimble, who waited upon him, also made out his bill, and the\r\ngreat gentleman was so much pleased with his writing and business style\r\nthat he at once took measures to secure his services in his department.\r\nThus James Trimble at the age of fifteen years became an apprenticed\r\nclerk in the Land Office.\r\n\r\nThe endorsement upon the archives of the Board of War and the Council of\r\nSafety indicates that James Trimble was subordinate clerk in the State\r\nCouncil as early as 1775, and when Colonel Timothy Matlack became the\r\nfirst Secretary of the Commonwealth, March 6, 1777, James Trimble became\r\nDeputy Secretary, and so continued down to Thursday, January 14, 1837.\r\n\r\nPending some difficulties with the Supreme Executive Council in regard\r\nto his accounts of his money trust, Colonel Matlack resigned his\r\nposition as Secretary, and March 25, 1783, General John Armstrong, Jr.,\r\nwas commissioned in his stead.\r\n\r\nGeneral Armstrong was elected a member of Congress in 1787, and November\r\n7 of that year Charles Biddle became Secretary. He served in that office\r\nuntil January 19, 1791, when Alexander James Dallas, Esq., was\r\ncommissioned by Governor Thomas Mifflin the first secretary of the\r\nCommonwealth, under the Constitution of 1790.\r\n\r\nOn March 12, 1791, the very day the Governor approved the Act of\r\nAssembly providing for a Deputy Secretary, Mr. Dallas appointed James\r\nTrimble, who had served continuously under his several predecessors, to\r\nbe Deputy Secretary, and the appointment was approved by the Governor.\r\n\r\nSecretary Dallas resigned his commission December 2, 1801, when Thomas\r\nMcKean Thompson succeeded him. Nathaniel B. Boileau became Secretary of\r\nthe Commonwealth, December 20, 1808, and remained through the three\r\nterms of Governor Simon Snyder, when he was succeeded by Thomas\r\nSergeant, December 16, 1817; he resigned July 6, 1819, when Samuel B.\r\nIngham was commissioned; Andrew Gregg took up the reins of office\r\nDecember 19, 1820, serving three years, when Molton C. Rogers became\r\nSecretary; he resigned January 2, 1826, to be succeeded by Isaac G.\r\nBarnhard, who served less than two years, when Calvin Blythe was\r\ncommissioned November 28, 1827; Samuel McKean was commissioned December\r\n16, 1829, and was succeeded by James Findley who served until December\r\n15, 1835, when Thomas H. Burrowes became Secretary of the Commonwealth,\r\nand in all this time, and with these fifteen changes in the office of\r\nSecretary, a commission and dedimus issued regularly every three years\r\nto James Trimble as Deputy Secretary of the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nHis records are models of neatness, his papers elaborately endorsed, and\r\nfiled with great care, so that in those days of tallow candles, when he\r\nwas wont to enter his office at night, he could, without striking a\r\nlight, lay his hands on any paper he wished.\r\n\r\nJames Trimble was of slight stature, dignified, brisk in his movements\r\nand carefully dressed in solemn black knee pants, queue, long hose, and\r\nbuckle shoes.\r\n\r\nWhen he died, Harrisburg lost its last gentleman of the old school for\r\nAlexander Graydon, his peer in dress and address, had gone before.\r\n\r\nIn the judgment of his contemporaries James Trimble was a faithful\r\npublic servant, a man of unimpeachable integrity, and obliging manners,\r\nand respected by the community at large.\r\n\r\nOn April 22, 1782, he married Clarissa, widow of John Hastings; her\r\nmaiden name was Claypoole. She was a descendant of James Claypoole, an\r\nintimate of William Penn, and brother to John Claypoole who married\r\nElizabeth, daughter of Oliver Cromwell. Mrs. Trimble died at Lancaster,\r\nFebruary 6, 1810. Of their eleven children two only survived them—Dr.\r\nJames Trimble, who died in Huntingdon County, in 1838, and Thomas R.,\r\nwho died in Chester County in 1868.\r\n\r\nJames Trimble helped pack and remove the State papers at the time the\r\nBritish occupied Philadelphia, and again when the seat of government was\r\nremoved to Lancaster in 1799, and from Lancaster to Harrisburg in 1812.\r\n\r\nAfter he removed to Harrisburg he was chosen trustee and treasurer of\r\nthe Presbyterian Church there, in which capacity he served until his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThat he survived his removal from office only eleven days many believed\r\nhe died of a broken heart. Truly if such be the case, party spirit must\r\nhave been at fever heat to cause the removal of such a public servant,\r\nwithout some other position for him.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Great Indian Conference Began in Easton\r\n                          on January 27, 1777\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 1777 opened for the colonists with much brighter prospects, as\r\nGeneral Washington had defeated the Hessians at Trenton, and close upon\r\nthis victory followed the action at Princeton, in which many\r\nPennsylvania organizations displayed such valor, but in which General\r\nHugh Mercer and a number of other officers and men fell.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, January 20, Brigadier General Philemon Dickinson, with about\r\n400 militia, composed of the two Westmoreland independent companies, of\r\nWyoming, Pa., and New Jersey militia, defeated a foraging party of the\r\nenemy of an equal number, near a bridge at Millstone River, two miles\r\nfrom Somerset Court House, New Jersey, and took forty wagons and one\r\nhundred horses, a large number of sheep and cattle, and some prisoners.\r\nGeneral Dickinson lost but five men.\r\n\r\nTo return to internal affairs: early in January, 1777, Continental\r\nCongress received information “that certain tribes of Indians living in\r\nthe back parts of the country, near the waters of the Susquehanna within\r\nthe Confederacy and under the protection of the Six Nations, the friends\r\nand allies of the United States,” were on their way to Easton for the\r\npurpose of holding a conference or treaty with the General Government.\r\n\r\nCongress thereupon appointed a commission, consisting of George Taylor,\r\nof Easton; George Walton and others to purchase suitable presents for\r\nthe Indians and conduct a treaty with them. The Assembly of Pennsylvania\r\nnamed Colonels Lowrey and Cunningham, while the Council of Safety sent\r\nColonels Dean and Bull. Thomas Paine was appointed secretary to the\r\ncommission.\r\n\r\nOn January 7, a company of Indians arrived at Wilkes-Barre to announce\r\nthe coming of the larger body en route to Easton. About January 15 the\r\nmain delegation reached Wilkes-Barre. There were seventy men and one\r\nhundred women and children in the party.\r\n\r\nAmong the chiefs were the following: Taasquah, or “King Charles,” of the\r\nCayuga; Tawanah, or “The Big Tree,” of the Seneca; Mytakawha, or\r\n“Walking on Foot,” and Kaknah, or “Standing by a Tree,” of the Munsee;\r\nAmatincka, or “Raising Anything” of the Nanticoke; Wilakinko, or “King\r\nLast Night” of the Conoy, and Thomas Green, whose wife was a Mohawk, as\r\ninterpreter.\r\n\r\nThe Indians held an informal conference there and received food from the\r\nWyoming authorities.\r\n\r\nThe conference was formally opened at Easton, January 27, in the new\r\nFirst (German) Reformed Church, on North Third street. It is said that\r\nwhile the organ played the members of the commission and the Indians\r\nshook hands with each other and drank rum to the health of the Congress\r\nand the Six Nations and their allies before proceeding to business.\r\n\r\nIt was soon learned that the English, through the influence of Colonel\r\nJohn Butler, in the King’s service at Niagara, were making a great\r\neffort to turn the Indians against the Americans.\r\n\r\nIn an official report of the treaty, subsequently made to the Supreme\r\nExecutive Council of Pennsylvania, it was stated: “The Indians seem to\r\nbe inclined to act the wise part with respect to the present dispute. If\r\nthey are to be relied upon, they mean to be neuter. We have already\r\nlearnt their good intentions.”\r\n\r\nThe members of the Supreme Executive Council, chosen under the\r\nConstitution of the State, met for the first time March 4, 1777, and\r\nproceeded to form an organization and the Council of Safety was\r\ndissolved. In joint convention with the Assembly, Thomas Wharton, Jr.,\r\nwas elected president, and George Bryan, vice president. To give new\r\ndignity to the executive of the new Government, the inauguration took\r\nplace on the following day, March 5.\r\n\r\nThomas Wharton, Jr., was born in Philadelphia in 1735. He was descended\r\nfrom an ancient English family and was the grandson of Richard Wharton,\r\nwho emigrated to Pennsylvania in 1683. His father, Joseph Wharton, of\r\nWalnut Grove, was an aristocrat of the day. Thomas Wharton was twice\r\nmarried, first to Susan, daughter of Thomas Lloyd, and subsequently to\r\nElizabeth, daughter of William Fishbourne. He was a warm supporter of\r\nthe principles of the Revolution, and on the change of government was\r\nelected to the highest office in the State.\r\n\r\nPresident Wharton died suddenly May 25 of the following year of an\r\nattack of quinsy, at Lancaster. His funeral on the day following was\r\nconducted by the State authorities, and as commander-in-chief of the\r\nforces of the State he was buried with military honors, and at the\r\nrequest of the vestry was interred within the walls of Trinity Church in\r\nLancaster. By his decease, the Vice President, George Bryan, assumed the\r\nexecutive functions.\r\n\r\nOn March 13 the Supreme Executive Council appointed a navy board,\r\nconsisting of Andrew Caldwell, Joseph Blewer, Joseph Marsh, Emmanuel\r\nEyre, Robert Ritchie, Paul Cox, Samuel Massey, William Bradford, Thomas\r\nFitzsimmons, Samuel Morris, Jr., and J. Thomas Barclay, to which board\r\nwas committed all powers necessary for that service. The board entered\r\nvery promptly upon its duties, meeting with many difficulties, boats out\r\nof repair and inefficiently manned, difficulties about rank in the\r\nfleet, all of which it succeeded in overcoming.\r\n\r\nThe same day a Board of War was appointed consisting of David\r\nRittenhouse, Owen Biddle, William Moore, Joseph Dean, Samuel Morris,\r\nSr., Samuel Cadwallader Morris, John Bayard, George Gray and Colonel\r\nJohn Bull. This board served most capably in assisting to carry out the\r\nprovisions of the new militia law.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker of the House being seriously ill, John Bayard was chosen\r\nSpeaker March 17. On the 20th Joseph Reed was appointed Chief Justice of\r\nPennsylvania, but he declined on account of military engagements and on\r\nJuly 28 Thomas McKean was named for that office.\r\n\r\nOn June 13, the Assembly required all white male inhabitants over\r\neighteen years of age, except in Bedford, Northumberland, and\r\nWestmoreland Counties to take an oath of allegiance before July 1, and\r\nthose in said counties before August 1, excepting, however, delegates in\r\nCongress, prisoners of war, officers and soldiers in the Continental\r\narmy and merchants and marines in port trading from foreign powers and\r\nnot becoming subjects. Any person refusing should be incapable of\r\nholding office, serving on juries, electing or being elected or even\r\nbringing lawsuits, or buying or selling lands and as was perfectly\r\nreasonable, should be disarmed.\r\n\r\nEarly in June, General Howe, commander of the British forces at New\r\nYork, showed a disposition to advance by land across New Jersey, and to\r\ntake possession of Philadelphia. On the 14th of that month he actually\r\nmade an advance by two columns, which led General Washington to believe\r\nthat this was his real intention. General Mifflin again came to\r\nPhiladelphia with messages to Congress and the Assembly, and there was\r\nintrusted to him and De Coudray the arrangements of the defense of the\r\nDelaware River.\r\n\r\nThe same day General Morris appeared before Congress to say that\r\nPhiladelphia was in danger.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Massacre of Settlers Along the Juniata River\r\n                         Began January 28, 1756\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Delaware Indians, especially those who lived west of the Susquehanna\r\nRiver, were exceedingly angry because of the sale of the lands along the\r\nSusquehanna and Juniata to the whites, and declared that those coveted\r\nhunting grounds had been given to them (the Delaware) by the Six\r\nNations, and that therefore the latter had no right to sell them.\r\n\r\nThe Six Nations admitted that they had given the region to their\r\ncousins, the Delaware, as a hunting ground, yet they did not hesitate to\r\nmake the sale to the English in 1754, and to confirm it in 1758.\r\n\r\nThe Delaware received none of the 400 pounds which had been paid to the\r\nSix Nations, and it is little wonder that they sought an opportunity and\r\npretext for that revenge against the English which they dared not show\r\nagainst their ancient conquerors, the Six Nations.\r\n\r\nSuch an opportunity was presented by General Braddock’s disaster on the\r\nMonongahela, July 9, 1755, immediately after which they, with the\r\nShawnee, became the active allies of the French.\r\n\r\nWithin three months their war parties had crossed the Alleghanies\r\neastward, and had committed atrocities among the frontier settlements.\r\n\r\nOn October 16 occurred the massacre on Penn’s Creek, in what is now\r\nSnyder County, and on the 25th, John Harris’ party was ambushed at\r\nMahanoy Creek.\r\n\r\nOn January 27, 1756, a party of Indians from Shamokin (now Sunbury) made\r\na foray in the Juniata Valley, first attacking the house of Hugh\r\nMitcheltree, who was absent at Carlisle, having left his house in the\r\ncare of his wife and a young man named Edward Nicholas. Both of these\r\nwere killed by the Indians, who then went up the river to the house of\r\nEdward Nicholas, Sr., whom they killed, also his wife, and took seven\r\nprisoners, namely, Joseph, Thomas and Catherine Nicholas, John Wilcox\r\nand the wife and two children of James Armstrong.\r\n\r\nThe scene of the first of these incursions was on the farm of James\r\nMitcheltree, who was a warrantee in Delaware Township in 1755, and where\r\nhe died in the early part of 1803. This farm then passed into the hands\r\nof John Thompson, and it is still in the hands of his descendants. Hugh\r\nMitcheltree, who escaped death or capture in this foray, was carried off\r\nby the Indians two months later, March 29, 1756. The Mitcheltree family\r\nlived near the present Thompsontown, Juniata County.\r\n\r\nWhile the Indians were committing the murders at the Mitcheltree and\r\nNicholas homes, an Indian named James Cotties, who wished to be captain\r\nof the party, but could not be so chosen, took with him a young brave\r\nand went to Sherman’s Creek, where they killed William Sheridan and his\r\nfamily, thirteen in number. They then went down the creek to the home of\r\ntwo old men and an elderly woman, named French, whom they killed.\r\nCotties often boasted afterward that he and the boy took more scalps\r\nthan all the others of the party.\r\n\r\nJames Cotties, in 1757, went to Fort Hunter and killed a young man named\r\nWilliam Martin, while he was busy picking chestnuts. After the war was\r\nover, the same Cotties being again at the same fort was reproached by\r\nanother Indian, named Hambus, for the death of young Martin, and a\r\nquarrel ensued in which Hambus killed Cotties.\r\n\r\nThere are letters extant which give an account of the massacre by the\r\nIndians, on the river between Thompsontown and Mexico. They reveal the\r\nfact that this was the largest butchery of the whites that ever took\r\nplace in the east end of Juniata County.\r\n\r\nA letter of January 28 proves that Captain James Patterson was with his\r\ncompany at his fort, on the Juniata, the day of the massacres.\r\n\r\nExtract from a letter dated Carlisle January 29, 1756, says:\r\n\r\n“This afternoon came to town a man that lived on Juniata, who in his\r\njourney this way called at the house where the woolcombers lived, about\r\nten miles from this place, and saw at his door a bed-tick, and going\r\ninto the house found a child lying dead and scalped. This alarmed us\r\nmuch and while we were consulting what to do, we received the enclosed,\r\nwhich puts it past all doubt that the enemy intend to attack Sherman’s\r\nValley or this place. We thought it necessary to acquaint you as soon as\r\npossible, not only to hurry you home, but, if thought needful, that the\r\npeople of York might send over some aid.”\r\n\r\nThe “enclosed” referred to in the above, was a long letter written by a\r\nsoldier in the garrison at “Patterson’s Fort, of Juniata,” dated January\r\n28, 1756, in which the fifteen murders of the Wilcox, Nicholas and\r\nArmstrong families were explained in all their horrible details, the\r\nwriter having visited the several places and witnessed for himself the\r\nbodies of the victims.\r\n\r\nThe letter continues:\r\n\r\n“The party that went to bury the dead, found one Sheridan and his wife,\r\nthree children and a man-servant, all murdered; also two others in\r\nanother house: these within a few miles of Carlisle.\r\n\r\n“I am heartily sorry that I must grieve you with an account of a most\r\ninhuman murder committed by the Indians at Juniata and Sherman’s Creek\r\non the 27th of last month. Within three miles of Patterson’s Fort was\r\nfound Adam Nicholson and his wife dead and scalped and his two sons and\r\na daughter carried off; William Wilcock and his wife dead and scalped;\r\nMrs. Hugh Micheltree and son of said Nicholson dead and scalped, with\r\nmany children, in all about seventeen. The same day one Sheridan, a\r\nQuaker, his wife and three children, and a servant were killed and\r\nscalped, together with one William Hamilton and his wife and daughter\r\nand one French, within ten miles of Carlisle, a little beyond Stephen’s\r\nGap.”\r\n\r\nOn March 24, Captain James Patterson with his scouting party of\r\nborderers fell in with a party of Indians on Middle Creek, now Snyder\r\nCounty, attacked them, killed and scalped one and put the rest to\r\nflight. On their return, Patterson reported that the country from the\r\nforks of the Susquehanna to the Juniata was “swarming with Indians,\r\nlooking for scalps and plunder, and burning all the houses and\r\ndestroying all the grain which the fugitive settlers had left in the\r\nregion.”\r\n\r\nThe Indians who committed these depredations were of the Delaware\r\nNation; there were no Shawnee among them. They had their headquarters on\r\nthe North Branch at Nescopeck and Wyoming, and were so incited by the\r\ncraftiness of the French that they threatened “to break the heads of any\r\nof their own race who advised peace with the English.”\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             John Penn, “The American,” Born in Slate-Roof\r\n                         House January 29, 1700\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen William Penn crossed the ocean in the Canterbury to visit his\r\nprovince in 1699, he came up to Chester, December 1. Two days later Penn\r\nreached Philadelphia, and made a formal call upon his deputy, Governor\r\nWilliam Markham, and other dignitaries of the town and province.\r\n\r\nFrom Markham’s house Penn proceeded to the Friends’ meeting house at\r\nSecond and High Streets, and took part in the afternoon meeting,\r\noffering a prayer and delivering one of those short incisive addresses\r\nin which he was so happy.\r\n\r\nPenn was very well received by all classes, says James Logan, who had\r\ncome out with the Governor and was in constant attendance upon him.\r\n\r\nAfter the meeting was over and the Friends had dispersed to their homes,\r\nPenn and his suite went to the house of Edward Shippen, and lived there\r\nfor a month. About January 14 he took up his residence in the\r\n“Slate-Roof House,” which was his home during his sojourn in his\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\nOn January 29, his son John, known as “The American,” was born. John was\r\nthe only one of William Penn’s children born in his province.\r\n\r\nThis old mansion when first built was the largest house in Philadelphia,\r\nand better known than any other, not excepting the “Letitia House,” of\r\nany place of historic interest connected with William Penn and the city\r\nhe founded.\r\n\r\nThe Slate-Roof House was built on the southeast corner of Second Street\r\nand Norris Alley, the site for many years of the Chamber of Commerce.\r\nThe house was built by Samuel Carpenter, and it stood until 1867.\r\n\r\nBesides being the residence of Penn in 1699, James Logan entertained\r\nLord Cornbury there in 1702 and Governor James Hamilton, Mrs. Howell and\r\nMrs. Graydon were successively its occupants, the ladies using it for a\r\nboarding house.\r\n\r\nAlexander Graydon, who lived there and whose mother was the Desdemona of\r\nthe pert British officers of the day and kept the place as a boarding\r\nhouse just before the Revolution, describes the old house, “as a\r\nsingular old-fashioned structure, laid out in the style of a\r\nfortification, with abundance of angles, both salient and re-entering.\r\nIts two wings projected to the street in the manner of bastions, to\r\nwhich the main building, retreating from sixteen to eighteen feet,\r\nserved for a curtain. Within it was cut up into a number of apartments\r\nand on that account was exceedingly well adapted to the purpose of a\r\nlodging house, to which it had long been appropriated.”\r\n\r\nThe yard or garden was graced with a row of venerable pine trees, and\r\nthe association of the place gave it a substantial historic interest. It\r\nbore much less the look of a fortress than Captain Graydon’s military\r\neye conceived.\r\n\r\nThe back building was as peaceful looking as the culinary offices should\r\nbe and the neat little chambers in the so-called bastions were cozy\r\nnooks, with chimney places in the corners. The kitchen had a giant pile\r\nof chimney, with a great fireplace and the garrets were high and roomy.\r\n\r\nThis house was built for Samuel Carpenter by James Portens. It was\r\nerected about 1698, and William Penn was probably its first occupant.\r\n\r\nSamuel Carpenter had built in 1684–85 a house on Front Street, near his\r\nwharf and warehouses, and it is likely he lived there after the\r\nSlate-Roof House was completed.\r\n\r\nCarpenter was a man of great ability and enterprise, accumulating wealth\r\nrapidly and doing much to build up the city of his adoption. He married\r\nHannah Hardiman, a Welsh Quakeress and preacher, in 1684, and held many\r\nimportant positions, member of the Assembly, treasurer of the province,\r\netc. He bought large tracts of land, owned numerous vessels, mines,\r\nquarries and mill seats, so much property, in fact, that it impoverished\r\nhim and threw him into serious pecuniary embarrassment, though he was\r\nranked as the richest man in the province.\r\n\r\nSamuel Carpenter died in his house on King Street (now Water Street)\r\nbetween Chestnut and Walnut Streets, April 10, 1714, and the Friends\r\nMeeting, after his death, said of him that “he was a pattern of\r\nhumility, patience and self-denial; a man fearing God and hating\r\ncovetousness; much given to hospitality and good works. He was a loving,\r\naffectionate husband, tender father, and a faithful friend and brother.”\r\n\r\nWhen Carpenter leased his Slate-Roof House to Penn it was furnished and\r\nso occupied until his departure for England, when James Logan moved into\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe Slate-Roof House was sold in the latter part of 1703 to William\r\nTrent, the Iverness miller, who founded and gave his name to Trenton, N.\r\nJ.\r\n\r\nTrent paid £850 for the property. In 1709 he sold it for £900\r\nPennsylvania currency to Isaac Norris, who occupied it until his removal\r\nto Fairhill in 1717.\r\n\r\nLogan was very desirous that Penn should buy the house when Trent\r\noffered it for sale, and said that it was hard that the Governor did not\r\nhave the money to spare. “I would give twenty to thirty pounds out of my\r\nown pocket, that it were thine, nobody’s but thine,” said honest James.\r\n\r\nThe Slate-Roof House remained in possession of the Norris family until\r\n1807, when it was bought by the Chamber of Commerce and torn down.\r\n\r\nFrom 1717 onward it seems to have been used as a boarding and lodging\r\nhouse, being in the hands of Mrs. Howell and then of Mrs. Graydon.\r\n\r\nGeneral John Forbes, successor to General Edward Braddock, died in the\r\nSlate-Roof House in 1759, at which time the house was kept by Mrs.\r\nHowell. Baron de Kalb lodged there in 1768–69, when he was the secret\r\nagent of France. Sir William Draper, the target of Junius’ sarcasm,\r\nlodged there during his visit to the colonies. James Rivington, the Tory\r\nprinter and publisher, ate and slept there.\r\n\r\nIt is also reported that John Hancock and George Washington lodged there\r\nduring the first sessions of the Continental Congress. Baron Steuben,\r\nPeter S. Duponceau and others lodged there after the British evacuated\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\nThe Slate-Roof House then became the seat of a boarding school, kept by\r\nMadame Berdeau, reputed to be the widow of Dr. Dodd, hanged in London\r\nfor forgery in 1777.\r\n\r\nThen this historic old mansion became a workshop, a general place of\r\nbusiness, a tenement house, with shops on the ground floor, which were\r\noccupied by tailors, engravers, watch-makers, silversmiths, etc. Under\r\none of the “bastions,” a notable oyster cellar was opened, the resort of\r\nthe merchants and bankers doing business in that vicinity.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Betsy Ross, Who Made First American Flag,\r\n                         Died January 30, 1836\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Elizabeth Claypoole died at her home in Arch Street, Philadelphia,\r\nJanuary 30, 1836, aged eighty-four years, her body was borne to Mount\r\nMoriah Cemetery and interred by the side of her husband, who had\r\npreceded her in death nearly twenty years. A simple monument records the\r\nabove facts, but does not tell those of the present generation that this\r\nheroine was none other than Betsy Ross.\r\n\r\nThe school children of today are learning more of the history of our\r\ncountry and its flag, but the story of the woman who made the first\r\nAmerican flag is always interesting.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the flag of our country had its birth in the City of\r\nPhiladelphia; that it was a patriotic woman of Philadelphia who made the\r\nfirst flag; that it first waved over the United States Congress then in\r\nsession in Independence Hall, is sufficient incentive for every boy and\r\ngirl in Pennsylvania to be justly proud.\r\n\r\nThe story of the flag is told on another day, but the story of how Betsy\r\nRoss became associated with it is to be today’s story.\r\n\r\nEver since the Revolution began there was real necessity for an American\r\nflag, but there was, however, no national flag authorized by an act of\r\nthe Continental Congress until June 14, 1777.\r\n\r\nThe committee appointed by Congress to prepare a design for the new flag\r\nconsisted of General George Washington, Robert Morris and Colonel George\r\nRoss.\r\n\r\nColonel Ross had a relative, Betsy Ross, who lived at 239 Arch Street,\r\nand who had previously made flags for the American Army and Navy.\r\n\r\nThe committee called upon Mrs. Ross, stated their mission, and asked her\r\nif she would make a flag such as was ordered by Congress.\r\n\r\n“I do not know whether I can, but I’ll try,” was her reply.\r\n\r\nThe act of Congress did not specify the number of points of the stars,\r\nor their arrangement, simply stating: “That the flag of the thirteen\r\nUnited States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the\r\nunion be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new\r\nconstellation.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Ross suggested that a star of five points would be more distinct,\r\npleasing and appropriative than the six-pointed star which the committee\r\nhad designed. Folding a piece of white paper, she cut, with a single\r\nclip of her scissors, a five-pointed star, and placing it on a blue\r\nfield, delighted the committee with her taste, ingenuity and judgment.\r\n\r\nThe committee decided that the stars, thirteen in number, should be\r\narranged in a circle in a blue field, as the circle is typical of\r\neternity.\r\n\r\nSo well pleased were the committee with the flag which Betsy Ross made\r\nthat they authorized her, in the name of Congress, to make the United\r\nStates flags. Betsy Ross employed many hands to aid her, and made flags\r\nfor the army, navy and public buildings.\r\n\r\nThe maiden name of Betsy Ross was Elizabeth Griscom. She was born in\r\nPhiladelphia in 1752, of Quaker parents. At an early age she married\r\nJohn Ross, son of an English clergyman, an upholsterer. He was a nephew\r\nof Colonel George Ross, of Lancaster, one of the signers of the\r\nDeclaration and one of the leaders of the young republic. Betsy never\r\nwent back to “Friends’ Meeting,” and was “read out” of meeting for this\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nJohn Ross died soon after his marriage and Mrs. Ross continued the\r\nupholstering business at 239 Arch Street, which had once been number 89.\r\nThis house is still standing, and is one of the most valued of the many\r\nhistoric places in old Philadelphia. It was in this little house, where\r\nBetsy Ross, a widow at twenty-five years of age, made the first United\r\nStates flag.\r\n\r\nBetsy Ross was not only noted for her skill with the needle, but quite\r\nas well for her piety and patriotism. So widely was her extraordinary\r\nskill recognized that she adorned the parlors of the wealthy with\r\ndraperies, the theatres with curtains, hotels with quilts and even\r\nstate-rooms of the finest packet boats were fitted up by her. It is also\r\nsaid that she made the handsome ruffled shirt bosoms worn by General\r\nWashington, and not a few for other patriots who held high office in the\r\nyoung nation.\r\n\r\nAt an early date, and before she made United States flags, she made\r\nColonial flags for the army and navy and there is a minute dated May 29,\r\n1777, “an order on William Webb to Elizabeth Ross for fourteen pounds\r\ntwelve shillings and two pence, for making ships’ colors,” etc.\r\n\r\nIn time Mrs. Ross married Joseph Ashburn, who was captured on the\r\nprivateer Luzerene and died a prisoner of war in Mill Prison, England.\r\nBy this marriage she had two children, Zillah, who died in infancy, and\r\nEliza, who married a Mr. Sullivan. Ashburn sent a farewell message to\r\nhis wife by a fellow-prisoner, John Claypoole, who later was exchanged\r\nfor a British prisoner. On reaching Philadelphia he delivered his\r\nmessage and personal effects, and about a year later married Mrs.\r\nElizabeth Ashburn.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1783, the Stars and Stripes were put to their first national\r\nuse in the demonstration for peace throughout the new nation. The Flag\r\nof Peace was the name given to it in this widespread employment of the\r\nensign.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks after this occasion Betsy Ross (Ashburn) and John Claypoole\r\nwere married.\r\n\r\nBy this marriage five children were born. One, Clarissa by name, the\r\nfirst child of this marriage, married a Mr. Wilson and succeeded to the\r\nbusiness of upholstering and making American flags. Subsequently Mrs.\r\nWilson became a member of the Society of Friends, and relinquished the\r\nbusiness of making flags for the United States Army and Navy, and thus\r\nafter many years, the making of the American flags passed from the house\r\nand family of Betsy Ross.\r\n\r\nClarissa was thirty-one years old when her father died from\r\nwar-inflicted diseases.\r\n\r\nAfter about eighty years of making American flags for the United States\r\nGovernment, the contracts passed from the Ross family, when Clarissa\r\nClaypoole Wilson made the following public declarations: “From\r\nconscientious motives ceased to furnish flags for military and naval\r\npurposes,” and “retired from the business on account of conscientious\r\nscruples.”\r\n\r\nThus the Ross family discontinued to fill Government contracts a quarter\r\nof a century after the death of Betsy Ross.\r\n\r\nDuring all the eighty years women and girls were exclusively employed in\r\nmaking flags, mostly daughters and granddaughters of Betsy Ross and her\r\nneighbors, as the work grew in volume.\r\n\r\nSo the tradition of Betsy Ross, as the maker of the first American flag,\r\nknown as the Stars and Stripes, has quite as interesting a sequel in the\r\naction of her daughter.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Robert Morris, Financier of the Revolution,\r\n                         Born January 31, 1734\r\n\r\n\r\nRobert Morris was born in Liverpool, England, January 31, 1734, son of\r\nRobert Morris, a nail maker, and grandson of Andrew Morris, who was a\r\nseafearing man of the British Isles.\r\n\r\nRobert Morris, Sr., was the Maryland agent of a London tobacco firm.\r\nWhen Robert, Jr., was thirteen years old, his mother having died, he\r\ncame to America, rejoined his father and was for a time under the\r\ntuition of a clergyman and then entered the mercantile firm of Charles\r\nand Thomas Willing.\r\n\r\nIn 1750, Morris, the father, died leaving a small estate. When Robert,\r\nthe son, reached the age of twenty-one, Charles Willing made him a\r\npartner in the business and turned over his own share to his son,\r\nThomas. The firm of Willing & Morris became famous, and soon their trade\r\nwas extended to Europe and the West Indies. Long before the battle drums\r\nof the Revolution were heard the two partners became wealthy men and\r\nwere regarded as among the foremost people of the city.\r\n\r\nWilling and Morris were among the merchants who protested against the\r\nStamp Act, and in 1766 Robert Morris was one of the Board of Port\r\nWardens.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the news of Lexington reached Philadelphia, the Assembly\r\nappointed a Committee of Safety. Robert Morris was a member and helped\r\ngreatly to get powder and firearms, to organize troops and to fortify\r\nthe Delaware.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly elected him a member of the Continental Congress and his\r\npractical knowledge of ships made him a member of the Naval Committee\r\nand the first American Navy was soon launched.\r\n\r\nApril, 1776, he was specially commissioned to suggest methods and\r\nprovide plans for procuring money to prosecute the war. No other man in\r\nCongress, probably, could have succeeded so well, and he was not\r\nrelieved from this task while the war lasted.\r\n\r\nHowever reluctantly he subscribed to the Declaration of Independence,\r\nwhen the crucial moment came he risked his fortune and faced beggary for\r\nhis family and he looked at the gallows for himself as bravely as any of\r\nhis contemporaries. Other Pennsylvanians who voted against it lost their\r\nplaces, but neither Pennsylvania nor the Colonies could spare Robert\r\nMorris.\r\n\r\nWhen Congress in a fright fled from Philadelphia to Baltimore, Morris,\r\nwith two other men, was left in charge of its affairs and the defense of\r\nthe capital of the infant republic. The two men who were to assist\r\nMorris failed to appear, but Morris stuck faithfully to his post, and he\r\nbecame really the ruler of the city.\r\n\r\nWhen Washington defeated the British at Trenton, the English were\r\nsurprised but not troubled. They expected Washington’s unpaid army to\r\ndisband and Morris thought so too. He promised $10 extra pay to each\r\nsoldier if he would remain six weeks longer, then went to his Quaker\r\nfriends and on his personal credit borrowed the money and turned the\r\ncash over to Washington on New Year’s Day. Hope sprang up again in\r\npatriotic hearts.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Brandywine there remained no hope of saving\r\nPhiladelphia. Congress fled once more, this time to Lancaster, then to\r\nYork. The Liberty Bell was hauled away to Allentown, where it was hidden\r\nunder the floor of the Zion Reformed Church. The State officials went to\r\nLancaster, and Morris traveled there also.\r\n\r\nMorris was not eligible for re-election in 1778, but he worked to supply\r\nthe army. He turned over a cargo of ninety tons of lead for cartridges\r\nat a time when the troops sorely needed them. In 1780 he was again\r\nchosen to the Assembly, and a year later was chosen by Congress to be\r\nSuperintendent of Finance.\r\n\r\nSome persons had wished Alexander Hamilton to take this post, but\r\nHamilton himself proposed Morris. Until the end of the war Morris had\r\npower to appoint and dismiss all employes in his own department and\r\ncould even fix their salaries. No one else connected with the Government\r\npossessed such extensive powers.\r\n\r\nMorris counseled with Washington the project of transferring his army\r\nsouthward to block Cornwallis. When the troops appeared in Philadelphia,\r\nWashington, Count de Rochambeau and other generals dined with Morris and\r\nused his house on Market Street as their headquarters.\r\n\r\nDuring this visit Morris borrowed money which the Count de Rochambeau\r\nhad brought to pay his own soldiers and gave it to the Americans. He\r\nadvanced every shilling of his own money and borrowed all he could\r\nobtain from his friends.\r\n\r\nRobert Morris realized that a national bank was necessary, but few had\r\nsufficient confidence to invest in the shares, but just at this time\r\nFrance sent over some hard money, which was landed at Boston. Morris\r\nsent two trustworthy men to bring the coins to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThe treasure amounted to half a million dollars. The coins were packed\r\nin great oak boxes, which when filled weighed a ton. These chests were\r\nset on the axle of a cart and driven by oxen, through country which\r\ncontained many English troops. After a drive of two months, the coins\r\nwere safely dragged into Philadelphia. Half the money was used to start\r\nthe bank, which was chartered December 31, 1781, as the “Bank of North\r\nAmerica.”\r\n\r\nAt the same time the bank opened its doors, Morris reported to Congress\r\nthat a mint should be established, in which money could be coined of one\r\nkind and one standard. The mint was established and has been making\r\ncoins to this day.\r\n\r\nRobert Morris was a member of the convention which framed the Federal\r\nConstitution, and he had the pleasure of nominating his friend, General\r\nWashington, for presiding officer.\r\n\r\nAfter this Constitution was ratified by the States, Pennsylvania chose\r\nRobert Morris and William Maclay as her first two Senators.\r\n\r\nMorris owned several magnificent homes, and much desirable real estate,\r\nand was regarded as the richest man in America. But he had been too\r\nhopeful. Land values did not rise quickly and he and his partners could\r\nnot sell their properties, nor were they able to pay their debts.\r\n\r\nAt last the crash came and Morris was sent to prison for debt, February\r\n15, 1798. Close to the prison sat the Congress which, on April 4, 1800,\r\npassed the Bankrupt Act, though it was not until August 26, 1801, that\r\nMorris regained his liberty. He came out with three millions of debt to\r\nbe a pensioner on his family.\r\n\r\nOn May 7, 1806, Robert Morris died and was buried in Christ Churchyard.\r\nHis widow, who survived him twenty-one years, in 1824 received the first\r\nprivate call made by Lafayette in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nIt is sad to think that a man who did so much for his country should at\r\nlast have done so badly for himself. If we had had no Robert Morris\r\nthere would probably have been no United States. All he had was at the\r\nservice of America. There was no truer patriot. It was his confidence in\r\nthe quick growth of the young nation that ruined him. Our country owes a\r\ngreat debt to Robert Morris, the Financier of the Revolution.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                First Division of Province Into Counties\r\n                         Begun February 1, 1685\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter William Penn had spent nearly two years in his new province and\r\nhad made a trip of investigation as far interior as the Susquehanna\r\nRiver, held many interviews with Lord Baltimore over the vexed question\r\nof boundary, made several treaties with the Indians and placed the\r\ngovernment of his province in competent hands, he returned to England,\r\nwhere he arrived during August, 1684.\r\n\r\nCharles II died December 12 following, and was succeeded by James, Duke\r\nof York, whose accession was greatly dreaded by the Protestants, who\r\napprehended a revival of the persecutions during the reign of Mary. Penn\r\nmight have taken advantage of these apprehensions to induce more\r\nemigrants to settle in Pennsylvania, but he was disinterested and used\r\nhis influence with the King to grant liberty of conscience to all\r\nreligionists, and more especially to the Quakers.\r\n\r\nPenn stood in high favor with King James long before he ascended the\r\nthrone, on account of friendship which James had for his father, who had\r\nbravely fought under his flag, and this was increased by the son, who by\r\nthat means succeeded in obtaining from the King’s Council a favorable\r\ndecree in his dispute with Lord Baltimore over the boundaries of his\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\nThe lines of separation between the County of Philadelphia and those of\r\nBucks and Chester were confirmed by the Provincial Assembly February 1,\r\n1685.\r\n\r\nThis was a peculiar situation. Bucks and Chester were laid out with\r\nspecified boundaries adjoining Philadelphia, and, as a consequence, the\r\nCounty of Philadelphia embraced the whole province between Chester and\r\nBucks and north-northwest and northeast to an indefinite extent. This,\r\nof course, meant as far as Penn had purchased the land from the Indians.\r\n\r\nDuring his absence from the province all was not well with William Penn\r\nin England or with his followers in the beloved Pennsylvania.\r\nDissensions sprang up between the Legislature and the Executive, and\r\nbetween the members from the territories and those from the province\r\nproper, which threatened the loss of all his possessions. Troubles of\r\nPenn in America were not all confined to civil affairs, for his\r\nreligious society was torn with dissension.\r\n\r\nIn 1685, the Proprietary appointed Nicholas More, a London lawyer,\r\npresident of the “Free Traders” and a member of the Assembly, to the\r\noffice of Chief Justice. The Assembly was jealous of its prerogatives\r\nand disregarded the fundamental laws of the province in enacting\r\nstatutes without previously publishing them as required to do by the\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nChief Justice More opposed some of the laws of the Assembly, and\r\nparticularly those which attempted to alter the organization of the\r\ncourts, and he incurred the enmity of the House, which proceeded to\r\nimpeach him. He was charged with violence, partiality and negligence, in\r\na cause in which the society of Free Traders was interested. Ten\r\narticles were preferred against him, which he refused to answer, though\r\nfrequently summoned by the Council.\r\n\r\nMore was saved from conviction by a technicality, but was not protected\r\nfrom punishment. He was expelled from the Assembly, and was interdicted\r\nall places of trust by the Council until he should be tried upon the\r\narticles of impeachment or give satisfaction to the board. His\r\npunishment was not severe because he retained the confidence of the\r\nProprietary.\r\n\r\nThe anger of the House was extended to Patrick Robinson, clerk of the\r\nProvincial Court, who refused to produce the minutes of that court. They\r\nvoted him to be a public enemy and ordered him into the custody of the\r\nSheriff.\r\n\r\nWhen brought before the House Robinson refused to answer questions and\r\nthrew himself at full length upon the floor. He was disqualified from\r\nholding any office in the province or territories, but this sentence\r\ndoes not seem to have been enforced, for he afterward held the clerkship\r\nin the Council and other offices.\r\n\r\nNeither More nor Robinson were Quakers. They were charged with enmity to\r\nthat sect, or, in the language of Penn, “were esteemed the most unquiet\r\nand cross to Friends.”\r\n\r\nThere were other disturbances at this time in the province. John Curtis\r\nwas charged with “uttering troublesome and dangerous words against the\r\nKing.”\r\n\r\nCharges were made against several officers of the Government for\r\nextortion, and gross immoralities were practiced among the lower class\r\nof people inhabiting the caves on the banks of the Delaware. These and\r\nother things were reported with great exaggeration in England by the\r\nenemies of Penn and the Quakers. They prevented emigration and greatly\r\naffected the reputation of the Society of Friends and the Proprietary.\r\n\r\nIn 1686 Penn changed the form of executive government to a board of five\r\ncommissioners, any three of whom were empowered to act. The board\r\nconsisted of Thomas Lloyd, Nicholas More, James Claypoole, Robert Turner\r\nand John Eckley.\r\n\r\nIn 1688 the actions of the Assembly were marked by the usual want of\r\nunanimity and the objectionable act of laying on its members a solemn\r\ninjunction of secrecy. This measure was not without an exhibition of\r\nundignified violence. Lloyd requested to be relieved from his office,\r\nand his request was reluctantly granted, and on his recommendation the\r\nProprietary changed the plural executive into a single deputy, and named\r\nCaptain John Blackwell, formerly an officer of Cromwell, under whom he\r\nhad earned a distinguished reputation in England and Ireland. He was in\r\nNew England when he received his commission, dated July 25, 1688.\r\n\r\nGovernor Blackwell met the Assembly in March, 1689, but through some\r\nmisunderstanding between him and some of the Council the public affairs\r\nwere not managed with harmony, and but little was done during his\r\nadministration, which terminated in December when he returned to\r\nEngland, and the government of the province, according to charter, again\r\ndevolved upon the Council, with Thomas Lloyd as president.\r\n\r\nThe revolution in England during 1688, which drove James from the\r\nthrone, also lost for the Proprietary all his influence at the English\r\ncourt. He was now an object of suspicion. His religious and political\r\nprinciples were misrepresented. He was denounced as a Catholic, a Jesuit\r\nof St. Omers, and a self-devoted slave of despotism, and was even\r\ncharged with conspiracy to restore James. He was freed of all these\r\ncharges and arranged to again visit his Province of Pennsylvania, and\r\nwas about to set sail when he was detained by another persecution.\r\n\r\nHe was charged with being engaged in a conspiracy of the Papists to\r\nraise a rebellion, and restore James to the throne. He narrowly escaped\r\narrest on his return from the funeral of George Fox, the celebrated\r\nfounder of the Society of Friends. Rather than suffer the ordeal of\r\nanother trial he retired to privacy and his contemplated colony failed\r\nand the expense of the outfit was lost.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             Governor Pattison’s Administration to Burning\r\n                      of Capitol, February 2, 1897\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the campaign of 1890 the political conditions in Pennsylvania were\r\nsomewhat similar to those of the preceding gubernatorial campaign.\r\n\r\nFour candidates were again in the field. The Republicans named as their\r\nstandard bearer George W. Delamater, who defeated Daniel H. Hastings in\r\nthe convention by eleven votes; former Governor Robert E. Pattison was\r\nnow eligible to again become a candidate and was promptly nominated by\r\nthe Democrats, and the Prohibition and Labor parties named John D. Gill\r\nand T. P. Rynder as their candidates.\r\n\r\nThe campaign again revealed great dissatisfaction in the majority party\r\nand Pattison was elected for a second time. He was inaugurated on\r\nJanuary 20, 1891.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of May, 1891, there occurred great excitement by\r\nfailure of the Keystone and Spring Garden National Banks of\r\nPhiladelphia. John Bardsley, familiarly known as “Honest John,” was City\r\nTreasurer, and a depositor not only of moneys belonging to that city,\r\nbut also of taxes collected for the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nA few days after the failure of these banks it was found that Bardsley’s\r\nlosses would make him a defaulter to the city and the State to a large\r\namount. He at once resigned his office, and was as promptly prosecuted\r\nfor embezzling public funds. On trial, he pleaded guilty and was\r\nsentenced to fifteen years’ imprisonment and to pay a fine of $237,000.\r\n\r\nBallot reform became one of the leading questions before the Legislature\r\nand on June 19, 1891, a reform act was passed, which was known as the\r\n“Australian” ballot system, which provided for secrecy in voting.\r\n\r\nThere were several serious labor disputes during Governor Pattison’s\r\nAdministration, in the suppression of which it was necessary to use the\r\nstrong arm of State authority. April 2, 1891, a riot occurred in\r\nWestmoreland County in which seven persons were killed and twenty-one\r\nwounded. Two regiments of the National Guard were sent to assist the\r\nsheriff in restoring peace.\r\n\r\nThe great labor riots at Homestead occurred early in July, 1892, and on\r\nthe sixth the sheriff of Allegheny County asked the Governor for militia\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the trouble here was a reduction of wages in the Carnegie\r\nSteel Company, and the officials of the corporation employed armed men\r\nto patrol the property and protect the men who accepted the cut in wages\r\nand remained at their jobs. A large force of Pinkerton detectives was\r\nalso employed to assist in this protection. The striking miners attacked\r\nthose detectives and in the riots a dozen lives were lost.\r\n\r\nThe militia was not sent on first call for aid, but on July 10, after\r\nother riots, Governor Pattison ordered two brigades of the National\r\nGuard to Homestead. They arrived there on the morning of July 12. The\r\npresence of the troopers overawed the malcontents and peace was\r\nimmediately restored.\r\n\r\nAnother riot occurred January 27, 1893, at Mansfield, Allegheny County,\r\nwhich resulted in loss of life and property. In June, 1894, it was\r\nnecessary to send two regiments of militia into Jefferson County to\r\npreserve life and property on account of rioting among foreign miners.\r\nThere were fifty-three strikes in 1893, and twenty-seven in 1894, all\r\nfailing in their purpose save three.\r\n\r\nThe interest in forestry had increased to such an extent that in 1893 a\r\ncommission on forestry was created by Act of Legislature. William F.\r\nShunk was appointed engineer and Dr. J. F. Rothrock, botanist of the\r\ncommission.\r\n\r\nIn 1893, the Legislature appropriated half a million dollars for the\r\nerection of a fireproof building on the east side of the Capitol\r\ngrounds, to be occupied by the State Library and various executive\r\noffices.\r\n\r\nIn the campaign of 1894, five candidates contested the election for\r\nGovernor. General Daniel H. Hastings, of Bellefonte, was nominated by\r\nthe Republicans, William M. Singerly, of Philadelphia, was the\r\nDemocratic standard bearer, while Charles I. Hawley, Jerome T. Allman\r\nand Thomas H. Grundy, represented the Prohibition, People’s and\r\nSocialist-Labor parties respectively. The Republicans presented a united\r\nfront and easily elected General Hastings, who assumed office on January\r\n15, 1895.\r\n\r\nThe first important change in the Government was the creation of the\r\nSuperior Court, which was done by an act passed June 24, 1895.\r\n\r\nGovernor Hastings, June 28, appointed Ex-Governor James A. Beaver,\r\nEdward N. Willard, John J. Wickham, Charles E. Rice, Howard J. Reeder,\r\nGeorge B. Orlady and Henry J. McCarthy as the original members of the\r\nCourt, with Charles E. Rice as President Judge. At the ensuing election\r\nthe six first named and Peter P. Smith were elected for the full term of\r\nten years.\r\n\r\nThe first vacancy was occasioned by the resignation of Justice Willard,\r\nSeptember 1, 1897, and William W. Porter was commissioned September 14;\r\nnext was the death of Justice John J. Wickham, June 18, 1898, and he was\r\nsucceeded by William D. Porter, July 6; then Justice Reeder died\r\nDecember 28, 1898, to be succeeded by Dimner Beeber, January 2, 1899,\r\nwho served only until his successor was elected.\r\n\r\nJames I. Mitchell was commissioned December 6, 1899, and resigned\r\nNovember 28, 1902, his place being filled by Thomas A. Morrison,\r\nDecember 30, 1902; Justice William W. Porter resigned January 27, 1903,\r\nhis place being filled by John J. Henderson. John B. Head was elected\r\n1905, and resigned April 12, 1922. John W. Kephart was elected 1913, and\r\nresigned January 6, 1919, to become a member of the Supreme Court, his\r\nplace being filled by the commission of William H. Keller.\r\n\r\nFormer Governor James A. Beaver died January 31, 1914, and Frank M.\r\nTrexler was commissioned February 6. J. Henry Williams succeeded Justice\r\nMorrison December 9, 1915; he died October 24, 1919, and was succeeded\r\nby William B. Linn, November 5. President Charles E. Rice retired at the\r\nend of his term, December, 1915. Justice Head resigned April 12, 1922,\r\nand Robert S. Gawthrop was commissioned.\r\n\r\nThe present court is composed of President Judge George B. Orlady, the\r\nonly survivor of the original court; William D. Porter, who has served\r\nsince July 6, 1898; John J. Henderson, who was commissioned March 11,\r\n1903; Frank M. Trexler, William H. Keller, William B. Linn and Robert S.\r\nGawthrop.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture was created by act of March 13, 1895, and\r\nThomas J. Edge was commissioned the first Secretary. His successors have\r\nbeen John Hamilton, N. B. Critchfield, Charles E. Patton, Frederic\r\nRasmussen and Frank P. Willits, the incumbent.\r\n\r\nJuly 3, 1895, the Legislature authorized the erection of a monument to\r\neach Pennsylvania regiment engaged in battles of Chickamauga and\r\nChattanooga. These were all placed in the proper positions by 1898, and\r\nreflect much credit to the State and those who had this patriotic work\r\nin charge.\r\n\r\nThe old Capitol Building was destroyed by fire February 2, 1897. The\r\nGovernor took immediate steps for the erection of a new Capitol Building\r\nand the Legislature promptly authorized a commission to supervise the\r\nerection of the same.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Benedict Arnold Arrested for Conduct in\r\n                     Philadelphia February 3, 1779\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen our troops took possession of Philadelphia the day following the\r\nevacuation of the British, June 18, 1778, General Benedict Arnold, then\r\nflushed with the recent capture of Burgoyne, was sent by General\r\nWashington to assume command of the city, and his headquarters were\r\nestablished at Henry Gurney’s.\r\n\r\nThe autocratic demeanor of Arnold would make it appear as if\r\nPhiladelphia, appalled at the circumstances, deemed it provident to make\r\nno resistance. Arnold, however, to their agreeable surprise, was polite\r\nand clever, as were his able aides, Major Franks and Captain Clarkson.\r\n\r\nIt was here that Arnold entered upon a style of living but ill according\r\nwith republican simplicity. He issued a proclamation, among other\r\nthings, to prevent the removal, transfer, or sale of goods or\r\nmerchandise in possession of the inhabitants belonging to the King of\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\nArnold prevented even army officers from purchasing while he made\r\npurchases on his own account, and then through agents sold them at\r\nexorbitant prices.\r\n\r\nThe first incident in Arnold’s administration which attracted attention\r\nto his conduct was his questionable handling of the award of prize money\r\nobtained in the capture of the British sloop “Active.”\r\n\r\nHaving succeeded in ingratiating himself into the good will of the\r\nShippen family, Arnold won the affections of Margaret (“Peggy”) Shippen,\r\nthe young and accomplished daughter of Edward Shippen, afterward Chief\r\nJustice of the State, who became his second wife.\r\n\r\nOwing to a recent wound received under circumstances which would alone\r\nhave established a claim to grateful remembrances, had not his\r\nsubsequent extraordinary defection obliterated his name from the roll of\r\nhis country’s heroes, Arnold during his marriage ceremony was supported\r\nby a soldier and when seated his disabled limb was propped upon a camp\r\nstool. These wounds may perhaps have made him more interesting to the\r\nlovely but unfortunate bride.\r\n\r\nAt all events, her “hero,” except for his character for extravagance,\r\nwas at that moment regarded with a share of public favor, if not with\r\nany feeling of popular affection. He had rendered “some service to the\r\nState,” and was distinguished for gallantry among the bravest of the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nIt is as unjust as vain to urge, as some have done, in palliation of his\r\nstupendous crime, the fashionable and expensive propensities of his\r\nbeautiful and accomplished wife. That she was addicted to displays of\r\nwealth inconsistent with the spirit of her time and the condition of\r\npublic affairs may not with propriety be questioned; but no external\r\ninfluence can move a truly great and honorable mind and heart from a\r\nfixed purpose of patriotic or social duty.\r\n\r\nWhen a mob was formed which gave out an intention to assault the house\r\nof Hon. James Wilson, which became known as “Fort Wilson,” and assault\r\nhis person, it was a day of great excitement in Philadelphia. Wilson’s\r\nfriends gathered around him and prepared to defend him as best they\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the mob and militia assembled on the commons, while a\r\nmeeting of the principal citizens took place at the Coffee House. The\r\nmob began its march from Arch above Fifth Street. General Arnold came to\r\nrepress the mob, but he was so unpopular they stoned him.\r\n\r\nArnold’s conduct had given great offense to many of the active\r\nsupporters of the American cause, which involved him in a quarrel with\r\nthe authorities of Pennsylvania, and February 3, 1779, the Supreme\r\nExecutive Council ordered the Attorney General of the State to prosecute\r\nGeneral Arnold for illegal and oppressive conduct while in command of\r\nthe military in Philadelphia. Active among those who urged an\r\ninvestigation of the charges was General Joseph Reed, President of the\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\nA copy of the charges was presented to General Arnold, but he did not\r\ncare to meet them, and under pretense of attending to his duty, “fled\r\nfrom the inquiry.”\r\n\r\nFrom the camp on the Raritan, whence he had gone, he addressed a letter\r\n“To the Publick,” expressing his willingness that Congress should direct\r\na court-martial to inquire into his conduct. The accusations of the\r\nSupreme Executive Council were laid before that body, but the trial was\r\ndelayed and not until January, 1780, was the court-martial held.\r\n\r\nArnold was “convicted of using the public wagons for his own benefit,”\r\nbut he was acquitted of any corrupt intent and sentenced to be\r\nreprimanded by General Washington.\r\n\r\nThe verdict exasperated Arnold, who was still further humiliated by the\r\naction of Congress on claims preferred by him growing out of the\r\nCanadian expedition. His estimate was materially reduced by the Treasury\r\nofficers, and when Arnold appealed to Congress a committee reported that\r\na larger sum had been allowed him than was really due. Having failed to\r\nsecure a loan from the French Ambassador, he determined to betray his\r\ncountry for British gold.\r\n\r\nThe extravagance of Arnold produced the want of money and probably the\r\npredilections of the wife for what was splendid in the British army\r\ninfluenced them both to forfeit home and country for a splendid but\r\nelusive hope.\r\n\r\nIt must be remarked of “Peggy” Shippen that she had been the belle of\r\nPhiladelphia and the standing toast of the British officers while their\r\narmy was in Philadelphia. She had been brought up in British affections.\r\nHer father, Chief Justice Edward Shippen, was biased on that side. Major\r\nAndre was intimate in the family, which led to a friendly correspondence\r\nbetween Miss Shippen and him.\r\n\r\nAfter Arnold married her he, of course, became acquainted with that\r\nfact, and encouraged its continuance. It was continued, until at last\r\nArnold and Andre opened it more directly between themselves, under the\r\nnames of Gustavus for the former and John Anderson for the latter.\r\n\r\nThe failure of Arnold’s scheme to surrender West Point, his flight, the\r\nexecution of Andre, and the unhappy life of “Peggy” Shippen Arnold are\r\nfamiliar facts of history.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1780, the populace of the city of Philadelphia were drawn\r\ntogether in great excitement to witness the degradation and burning of\r\nArnold, the traitor, in effigy. His figure, in regimental uniform, was\r\nplaced on a cart and drawn through the city, to be burned on High Street\r\nHill.\r\n\r\nThe effigy had two faces and a mask in his left hand. Near him was the\r\ndevil, in black robes, holding out to him a purse of money. Near them\r\nwere transparencies of pictures and letters describing his treachery and\r\ntreason.\r\n\r\nThe procession began from the rear of St. George’s Methodist Church, in\r\nFourth Street, and was in the following order: Gentlemen on horseback, a\r\nline of Continental officers, sundry gentlemen in a line, a guard of the\r\nCity Infantry. Just before the cart, drums and fifes playing all the way\r\nthe “Rogues’ March.” Guards on each side of the cart.\r\n\r\nThe procession was attended with a numerous concourse of people who\r\nafter expressing their abhorrence of the treason and traitor, committed\r\nhim to the flames, and left both the effigy and the original to sink\r\ninto ashes and oblivion.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             John Penn, Last Proprietary Governor, Succeeds\r\n                         Richard Penn, Who Died\r\n                            February 4, 1771\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard Penn, one of the Proprietors, died February 4, 1771, and under\r\nthe terms of the family settlement, and his own will, Lieutenant\r\nGovernor John Penn succeeded to Richard Penn’s one-fourth interest in\r\nPennsylvania, and to the legal title of Governor.\r\n\r\nOn May 4, Governor John Penn embarked for England, when Mr. James\r\nHamilton administered the executive powers of the government as\r\npresident of council.\r\n\r\nRichard Penn, second son of the deceased Proprietary, and previously a\r\nmember of the Governor’s Council, was appointed by his uncle and brother\r\nto be Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania and the Lower Counties.\r\n\r\nHe arrived a second time in Pennsylvania on October 6, 1771.\r\n\r\nThe following May he married Miss Mary Masters, of Philadelphia. She was\r\na lady possessed of sufficient property to make her distinguished\r\nhusband somewhat independent.\r\n\r\nRichard Penn was blessed with a pleasing personality and most charming\r\nmanners, which, with his genuine desire to keep on intimate and friendly\r\nterms with the people, contributed much toward making him the most\r\npopular member of the founder’s family.\r\n\r\nHe had a dispute with his brother, John, concerning his father’s will.\r\nHe claimed that the manors were not appurtenant to the Proprietorship,\r\nbut were included in the private real estate directed to be sold for the\r\nbenefit of the residuary legatees.\r\n\r\nThomas Penn took the side of John, and the two found fault with\r\nRichard’s conduct in the government, but the latter defended himself,\r\nand spoke of his father’s promise to try to have the family agreement of\r\n1732 dissolved as unfair to his younger children in its stipulation that\r\nthe Proprietaryship should go to the eldest son, charged only with\r\npayments to the widows and younger children of certain sums which had\r\nsince become entirely disproportionate to the estates.\r\n\r\nGovernor Richard Penn was superseded in office by his brother, John, who\r\narrived back in the Province in August, 1773.\r\n\r\nFor a long time Richard did not go near him, and maintained that he had\r\nbeen greatly injured. John offered, as long as he should be governor, to\r\nallow him £500 a year, but Richard declared he would not be his\r\nbrother’s pensioner.\r\n\r\nThere is a story told that the brothers attended a banquet, sitting\r\nopposite to each other, on the right and left hand of the head of the\r\nfeast, but they did not speak to each other during the whole\r\nentertainment.\r\n\r\nRichard was, in May, 1774, induced to execute a release of his claim,\r\nand a reconciliation took place, when John appointed him naval officer,\r\nand Richard, accepting the position, called to thank him.\r\n\r\nDuring the administration of John Penn the counties of Northumberland,\r\nMarch 21, 1772, and Westmoreland, February 26, 1773, were erected.\r\n\r\nThe Connecticut claimants were unusually active at this time and\r\nextended their settlements, not only in the Wyoming Valley, but built\r\nforts and houses as far east as Shoholy and Lackawaxen, on the Delaware,\r\nwhere the Proprietary had manors, and on the west they seated themselves\r\non the West Branch of the Susquehanna.\r\n\r\nHe made strenuous efforts to eject the Pennsylvania claimants, but the\r\nProvincial authorities succeeded in holding the Yankees in check.\r\n\r\nThe colony of Connecticut endeavored to have Governor John Penn define a\r\nboundary, who would not accede to their demands, but advised the\r\nclaimants that they should take their dispute before the King and\r\nCouncil, where the Proprietaries of Pennsylvania would appear, and use\r\ntheir best offices toward a final decision.\r\n\r\nBut this was not the only trouble Governor Penn had to contend with\r\nusurpers, for at this very moment the boundary dispute with Virginia\r\nclaimed his best effort.\r\n\r\nThis contest was over the western limit of the province, where many\r\nsettlers, west of the Allegheny Mountains, believed they were the\r\nsubjects of the government of Virginia. Even George Croghan maintained\r\nthat the limits of Pennsylvania ended at the Laurel Hill Range. He\r\nunderstood that a degree of longitude meant forty-eight miles only.\r\n\r\nBut other and darker clouds were appearing above the horizon than those\r\nof boundary strips.\r\n\r\nThe importation of tea had been forbidden by the determined colonists,\r\nand but a small quantity had been brought into the country.\r\n\r\nLarge accumulations had to be disposed of and the owners were determined\r\nto unload it on the American market.\r\n\r\nOn the approach of tea ships pilots refused to conduct them into the\r\nharbor. A large cargo landed in Charleston, S. C., was stored in damp\r\ncellars, and rotted.\r\n\r\nShips designed for Boston entered that port, but before the tea could be\r\nlanded, a number of colonists boarded the vessels and emptied the cargo\r\ninto the sea.\r\n\r\nThe King and Parliament closed the port of Boston, and the colonists\r\nbelieved that their civil rights were destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe terms “Whigs” and “Tories” were introduced at this time—the former\r\nto describe those in sympathy with the cause of Boston, and arrayed on\r\nthe side of the colonies against Parliament; the latter to designate\r\nthose whose sympathies were with Great Britain against the colonies.\r\n\r\nThroughout the Province of Pennsylvania the warmest interest and most\r\ncordial sympathy were manifested for the people of Boston.\r\n\r\nGovernor Penn declined to convene the Assembly. The Committee of\r\nCorrespondence for Philadelphia sought the sentiments of the\r\ninhabitants, and in a meeting held in the State House, resolutions were\r\nadopted which resulted in the great meeting of Provincial deputies in\r\nPhiladelphia, July 15, 1774, which called upon the colonies to organize\r\na Continental Congress.\r\n\r\nSuch was the determined stand taken by the people of Pennsylvania, says\r\nSherman Day, who, with loyalty upon their lips, but the spirit of\r\nresistance in their hearts, pushed forward the Revolution.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Ole Bull, Founder of Colony in Potter\r\n\r\nCounty, Born February 5, 1810\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago more than one thousand persons from every section of\r\nPennsylvania, and not a few from Southern New York State, journeyed to a\r\nmost out-of-the-way place up in the wilds of Potter County to do homage\r\nto the memory of a great man, and to view the scene of one of the\r\nsaddest failures in the history of the settlement of our great\r\nCommonwealth.\r\n\r\nThis pilgrimage was to the land of Ole Bull, the great Norwegian\r\nviolinist, who during his lifetime played before the royal families of\r\nEurope and distinguished personages all over the world.\r\n\r\nOle Bornemann Bull was born in Bergen, Norway, February 5, 1810, and in\r\nhis earliest childhood developed a fondness for music, especially that\r\nof a violin.\r\n\r\nOle was destined for the church but failed to pass the necessary\r\nexamination, and at once decided that he would make music his vocation\r\nin life. He became a pupil of Paulsen for a short time, about the only\r\ninstruction he ever received from a master.\r\n\r\nIt was upon a visit to Paris that Paganini heard of the youthful genius\r\nand saw in him the latent possibility of a great musician. He encouraged\r\nhim to become a violin virtuoso. His first appearance on the concert\r\nstage was with Ernst and Chopin, and he was received with such approval\r\nthat it was not long before his fame had spread over the entire\r\ncontinent of Europe.\r\n\r\nAt a time before his talent was appreciated he had become so despondent\r\nthat he attempted suicide by drowning in the river Seine, but was\r\nrescued by a young French woman, Alexandriene Felice Villeminot, whom he\r\nmarried in 1836, and with whom he lived happily until her death in 1863.\r\n\r\nHe married a second time in 1870, taking as his bride Sara C. Thorpe, of\r\nWisconsin. Ole Bull died on the island of Lyso, near his native Bergen,\r\nin Norway, August 17, 1880.\r\n\r\nOle Bull first visited the United States in the winter of 1843–44. He\r\nhad grave doubts of the success of an American tour but was persuaded by\r\nfriends to come here. His success was instantaneous. He was received\r\nwith wild acclaim and the financial returns were far beyond his fondest\r\ndreams.\r\n\r\nHe again returned to America in 1852, and it was during this concert\r\ntour that he went to Williamsport and played before a vast audience,\r\nwhen the newspapers of that time wrote of him as “an attractive figure\r\nwith gold snuff box, diamond-studded buttons in his shirt and his\r\nfingers almost covered with rings.”\r\n\r\nCertainly a fastidious personage and one with such talent could not fail\r\nhis audiences. The bow with which he produced such perfect melody\r\ncontained a large diamond setting which sparkled as he drew it across\r\nthe strings.\r\n\r\nDuring his trip to Williamsport Ole Bull was entertained in the home of\r\nJohn F. Cowan, and the attention of the great violinist was called to\r\ncertain tracts of land owned by Cowan situated in Abbott and Stewardson\r\nTownships, Potter County, and the great advantages of this location for\r\ncolonization purposes, which so impressed Bull that he visited the site\r\nand noting a striking resemblance to his native Norway, decided at once\r\nto found a colony of his countrymen at this spot on the headwaters of\r\nKettle Creek.\r\n\r\nThe following year about thirty of his countrymen, forming the advance\r\nguard, arrived in this country and proceeded to their new home in the\r\nwilderness. These adventurers were not of the ordinary immigrant class,\r\nbut persons of culture and refinement, many being musicians of repute.\r\n\r\nTen days following the arrival of the first settlers, 105 other\r\ncolonists joined them and settled in one of the four villages. These\r\nbrought a minister and religious services were begun the first Sunday\r\nfollowing.\r\n\r\nThe first difficulty encountered by these new arrivals was the\r\ntransportation of their personal effects, which could only be hauled by\r\nwagon and then under the worst conditions imaginable.\r\n\r\nOle Bull’s colonization scheme attracted much attention, and friends and\r\nadmirers of his contributed stock, machinery and farming implements.\r\nAmong those who thus offered encouragement was Henry Clay, of Kentucky,\r\nwho gave blooded horses and cattle, descendants of which are still among\r\nthose in use in Potter County.\r\n\r\nFour villages were laid out: Oleona, named in honor of Ole Bull; New\r\nNorway, New Bergen and Walhalla. Sixteen houses were soon under\r\nconstruction at Oleona, all finished within a year.\r\n\r\nOle Bull soon after his arrival selected a site for his castle and\r\ngarden. Soon as the spot was determined upon, a flag pole of beautiful\r\nstraight pine was cut, trimmed and placed. By arrangement the name by\r\nwhich the town was to be known was to be pronounced as the flag was\r\nunfurled to the mountain breeze; “Oleona” was the name of the home of\r\nthe Norwegians. Thirty-one cheers, one for each State, were given and\r\nthree long ones for Ole Bull.\r\n\r\nThe evening was one of rejoicing and celebration. Bonfires were burning\r\neverywhere. Ole Bull made an address and then, taking his violin, played\r\nan anthem suitable to the occasion. At the conclusion of the hymn of\r\nliberty of old Norway, a gentleman representing the State of\r\nPennsylvania, stepped forward and welcomed Ole Bull and the Norwegians\r\nto the United States of America, and to the Commonwealth of\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\nOld Bull turned his attention to the erection of his castle, which was\r\nbuilt on a high eminence, about 200 feet above the valley below. From\r\nthis site he could view every part of his colony. A great retaining wall\r\nwas built at its base, extending one hundred and twenty feet in length\r\nand rising to a height of sixteen feet. This wall gave to the place the\r\nappearance of a large fortress and resembled some ancient castle of the\r\nold world.\r\n\r\nA broad road was constructed leading up to the castle, which was broad\r\nenough to drive three teams abreast.\r\n\r\nAny one familiar with the conditions these colonists had to face, in an\r\nalmost unbroken wilderness, far from any base of supplies with little\r\nmoney and less business sagacity, can realize that the colony was doomed\r\nto failure the very day it started. Bull was compelled to abandon his\r\nproject with the loss of his wealth, and again play in concert to recoup\r\nhis fortune.\r\n\r\nOle Bull was a musical genius, but building five cities in the wilds of\r\nPotter County was a different thing than playing Beethoven’s Eighth\r\nSonata on a violin. He could move audiences but not mountains.\r\n\r\nThe title of the lands he bought was defective, and, while it has been\r\ncharged that he was defrauded by Cowan, there is no evidence to\r\nsubstantiate that. Cowan took back the property and refunded Bull the\r\npurchase money.\r\n\r\nThe castle was never fully completed and never occupied by Bull. The\r\ndoors and windows were never put in place, and soon after this breaking\r\nup of the colony the building began to fall into decay until all that\r\nnow remains are the cellar and retaining wall.\r\n\r\nOle Bull never again visited the scene of his visionary paradise, but\r\nhis name is still perpetuated in the town of Oleona.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Dr. Joseph Priestley, Discoverer of Oxygen,\r\n                Died at Northumberland February 6, 1804\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Joseph Priestley was born near Leeds in Yorkshire, England, March\r\n13, 1733. He died at Northumberland, Pennsylvania, February 6, 1804.\r\n\r\nJoseph was the youngest of nine children. His father and grandfather\r\nwere prosperous cloth makers, employing, for that age, a large force of\r\nworkmen. From his parents, who were strict Calvinists, Joseph inherited\r\na deeply religious nature. He attended the school of the neighborhood\r\nand at eleven had read most of the Latin authors, and in a few years had\r\nmade considerable progress in Greek and Hebrew, with some knowledge of\r\nChaldee, Syrian and Arabic.\r\n\r\nHe began to experiment at the age of eleven, when he selected spiders\r\nand insects and placed them in bottles to ascertain how long they could\r\nlive without fresh air.\r\n\r\nA few years later he made “electrifying machines,” and a kite of fine\r\nsilk, six feet wide, which he could take apart and carry in his pocket.\r\nThe string was composed of thirty-six threads and a wire, similar to\r\nthat used by Dr. Franklin, in Philadelphia, to “bring electric fire from\r\nthe clouds.”\r\n\r\nAt nineteen, Priestley was sent to Daventry, where he embraced the\r\nheterodox side of almost every question, as he afterwards wrote of his\r\nthree years at Daventry: “In my time the academy was in a state\r\npeculiarly favorable to the serious pursuits of truth, and the students\r\nwere about equally divided upon every question of much importance, such\r\nas ‘Liberty and Necessity,’ the ‘Sleep of the Soul’ and all the articles\r\nof theological orthodoxy and heresy.”\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Daventry, he preached for three years to a dissenting\r\ncongregation at Needham. In 1761 he was a professor at Warrington\r\nAcademy. While here he published several of his books and made such\r\nexperiments in electricity and “fixed air,” that the results began to be\r\nnoised abroad. He married, while at Warrington, a daughter of a wealthy\r\niron manufacturer, a Mr. Wilkinson.\r\n\r\nIn one of his visits to London he met Benjamin Franklin. He became a\r\nmember of a famous club which met at the London Coffee House, and here\r\nhe interested Franklin in his experiments, and they became the closest\r\nfriends. Both became members of the Royal Society and both in turn\r\nreceived its highest honor, the Copley medal. Each obtained from\r\nEdinburgh University the degree LL. D. Oxford conferred a like degree\r\nupon Franklin, while for a space of a century it ignored his heretical\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nIn 1860 a statue of Dr. Priestley was erected at Oxford by Prince\r\nAlbert, afterward King Edward.\r\n\r\nFranklin wrote to Priestley, in 1777: “I rejoice to hear of your\r\ncontinual progress in those useful discoveries. I find you have set all\r\nthe philosophers of Europe at work upon fixed air (carbonic acid gas);\r\nand it is with great pleasure I observe how high you stand in their\r\nopinion, for I enjoy my friend’s fame as my own.”\r\n\r\nWhen Franklin was in France during the closing days of the Revolution,\r\nPriestley was there pursuing literary work. He was afterward made a\r\ncitizen and offered a seat in the National Assembly.\r\n\r\nShortly before the American Revolution, Priestley wrote anonymously\r\nthree pamphlets in defense of the colonies. His influence was potent.\r\n\r\nDr. Priestley announced his discovery of “dephlogisticated air” (oxygen)\r\nin 1774, to a large assemblage of philosophers who were dining at the\r\nhouse of M. Lavoisier in Paris. This was man’s first introduction to the\r\nmighty element that makes one-fifth of the atmosphere in volume and\r\neight-ninths of the ocean by weight, besides forming one-half of the\r\nearth’s solid crust and supporting all fire and all life.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that Dr. Priestley did not have a biographer worthy\r\nthe name, for his life is full of dramatic incidents, scientific\r\nattainment, learning and human interest.\r\n\r\nWe find him the central figure in the great gatherings of that day,\r\nreceiving the highest honors of his own and other Governments, and, when\r\nthe tide turned, denounced, persecuted, the victim of the mob, home and\r\nlibrary burned and pillaged. Through all the changes of this eventful\r\nlife we find him the same able, earnest, fearless and cheerful spirit to\r\nthe end.\r\n\r\nDr. Priestley, disregarding the warning of David Hume, and against the\r\nwishes of his philosophic friends, took up the cause of liberty in\r\nreligion. In his letters he makes a strong appeal for Christianity. His\r\ndesire was to revive in France and England the simple spiritual\r\ncommunion of the early church.\r\n\r\nHe published many works upon his religious views which made him the most\r\nhated man in England. He was everywhere detested. The streets of London\r\nwere strewn with scurrilous handbills and caricatures of him. Even his\r\nfellow associates in the Royal Society turned their backs upon him.\r\n\r\nBut it must be remembered that the men, at home and abroad, who opposed\r\nPriestley’s doctrines, were the very men who honored him as a man.\r\n\r\nAt Birmingham, in 1791, the last great religious riot in England\r\noccurred. It is often spoken of today as “Priestley’s Riots,” for the\r\ndoctor was the chief object of the mobs.\r\n\r\nIt was during a celebration on the anniversary of the fall of the\r\nBastille, at which Dr. Priestley was not present, that the cry of the\r\nmob was “Church and King.” Dr. Priestley had favored the agitation, then\r\nrife in Birmingham, for the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts. The\r\nmob suddenly marched toward his home and Dr. and Mrs. Priestley, who\r\nwere playing a game of backgammon, barely succeeded in escaping. The\r\ndoctor was pursued for several days and his life threatened.\r\n\r\nThe mob vented its rage by pillaging Priestley’s house and tearing it to\r\npieces. The rioters made a pyre of his furniture, manuscripts, priceless\r\napparatus, a library of 30,000 volumes, his private correspondence, and\r\nhis diaries, and all were destroyed by fire.\r\n\r\nIn 1794 Dr. Priestley came to America and settled at Northumberland, Pa.\r\nHere he erected a fine house and laboratory, and resumed his\r\nexperiments, which resulted in the discovery of three new gases. Here he\r\nwrote many books.\r\n\r\nDr. Priestley made trips to Philadelphia, where he lectured on\r\nhistorical and religious subjects, founding, in 1796, the first\r\nUnitarian Church in that city.\r\n\r\nThe University of Pennsylvania offered him the chair of chemistry, and\r\nafterward its presidency, but he preferred the quiet of his home at the\r\n“Forks of the Susquehanna.”\r\n\r\nIn 1874 the chemists of America met at Northumberland to celebrate at\r\nthe grave of Dr. Priestley the centennial of his great discovery.\r\nMessages were flashed across the Atlantic to chemists who met the same\r\nday at Birmingham to unveil a colossal statue of the man whom that city\r\nhad, eighty years before, driven from the streets, and burned his home\r\nand possessions.\r\n\r\nDr. Joseph Priestley was one of the most distinguished adopted citizens\r\nof our great State.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWestern Boundary in Dispute—Jail at| Hannastown Stormed February 7, 1775\r\n\r\nVirginia, by virtue of her “sea-to-sea” charter, made an indefinite\r\nclaim to all lands west and northwest of her coast line. She therefore\r\nheld that the region about the forks of the Ohio belonged to her.\r\nAccordingly, in 1749, the Ohio Land Company obtained from King George II\r\na grant of half a million acres on the branches of the Ohio. The object\r\nwas to form a barrier against the French and to establish trade with the\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nChristopher Gist was sent to explore the country, and, with eleven other\r\nfamilies, he settled within the present limits of Fayette County.\r\n\r\nA fort was begun in 1754 on the present site of Pittsburgh, but the\r\nFrench captured the Virginians, finished the fort and named it Fort\r\nDuquesne. In November, 1758, General John Forbes captured the fort from\r\nthe French. It was rebuilt and named Fort Pitt.\r\n\r\nBefore 1758 the western part of Pennsylvania could be approached from\r\nthe east only by the route of the Juniata and the Kiskiminitas. In that\r\nyear Forbes finished as far as Loyalhanna the road previously begun from\r\nFort Loudon by way of Bedford. Many Scotch-Irish settlers seated\r\nthemselves in the Ligonier Valley at Hannastown, and about the forks of\r\nthe Ohio, and, with settlers from Maryland and Virginia, they possessed\r\nthe land in comparative quiet until Pontiac’s War.\r\n\r\nPittsburgh, begun in 1760, was cut off from communication during\r\nPontiac’s conspiracy, and had it not have been for Colonel Bouquet’s\r\nvictory over the savages at Busby Run in 1764 it might have been\r\nentirely destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe growth of Pittsburgh was slow. England after the French and Indian\r\nWar had forbidden colonists to settle west of the headwaters of the\r\nrivers in the Atlantic basin, and the settlers on Redstone Creek and the\r\nCheat River were at one time driven off by the same British\r\nproclamation. A law was passed by the Assembly of Pennsylvania which\r\nimposed a death penalty, without benefit of clergy, for trespassing upon\r\nlands not purchased from the Indians.\r\n\r\nBut the continued accession of emigrants into this region made it\r\nnecessary to erect a new county, and the General Assembly, February 26,\r\n1773, established Westmoreland County, which included all of the\r\nsouthwestern portion of the province west of Laurel Hill. Robert Hanna’s\r\nsettlement, on the old Forbes road near the present site of Greensburg,\r\nwas made the county seat and named Hannastown.\r\n\r\nWhen Virginia saw that Pennsylvania was extending jurisdiction over the\r\nforks of the Ohio she renewed her claims to that country.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Dunmore, Governor of Virginia, asserted that Pittsburgh was\r\noutside the limits of Pennsylvania. In this contention he was supported\r\nby Colonel George Croghan and many others, who believed that the five\r\ndegrees of longitude which were to be the extent westward of\r\nPennsylvania placed the Monongahela beyond the limits of that province.\r\nCroghan maintained that the limits were at the Alleghenies or Laurel\r\nHill Range, “having heard, among other things, that a degree of\r\nlongitude at the time of the charter of William Penn meant forty-eight\r\nmiles.”\r\n\r\nAt the close of 1773 Governor Dunmore appointed Dr. John Connelly, a\r\nPennsylvanian, as commandant of the militia of Pittsburgh. He took\r\npossession of Fort Pitt and changed its name to Fort Dunmore.\r\n\r\nConnelly defied Pennsylvania authority and commanded all the people to\r\nappear as a militia under the authority of Lord Dunmore.\r\n\r\nArthur St. Clair, Prothonotary, Clerk, and Recorder of Westmoreland\r\nCounty, had Connelly arrested and bound over to keep the peace. St.\r\nClair reported his actions to Governor Penn, who sent to Lord Dunmore a\r\ndraught of the lines of Pennsylvania as surveyed by David Rittenhouse,\r\nWilliam Smith and Surveyor General John Lukens, showing that Pittsburgh\r\nwas east of the westernmost limit of the grant to the Proprietaries.\r\n\r\nDunmore demanded better evidence and that St. Clair should be dismissed\r\nfrom office for committing Dr. Connelly to jail.\r\n\r\nA large company paraded in arms through the streets of Pittsburgh, and\r\nopened a cask of rum. St. Clair issued an order for them to disperse.\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff allowed Connelly to go to Pittsburgh under promise to\r\nreturn. He traveled about collecting adherents, and on the day he was to\r\nreturn he appeared before the Hannastown court house at the head of 200\r\nmen, all armed and colors flying. He placed sentinels at the door and\r\nkept the magistrates from entering unless they agreed to act under\r\nVirginia authority, and he demanded their decision in writing.\r\n\r\nThe magistrates declared they would continue to act under authority of\r\nPennsylvania, when Connelly, a few days later, had them arrested and\r\nbrought before him in Pittsburgh. When they refused to give bail, he\r\nsent them to the court of Augusta County, at Staunton, Va.\r\n\r\nGovernor Penn advised the three magistrates to get bail, but sent the\r\nAttorney General of Pennsylvania and James Tilghman, as commissioners to\r\ninduce Lord Dunmore to join with the Proprietaries in a petition to the\r\nKing to have the boundary line run and marked, and in the meantime to\r\nagree to a temporary line of jurisdiction, suggesting that the\r\nMonongahela River would answer for a line.\r\n\r\nThe application to the King was consented to, but the boundary was not\r\nagreed upon.\r\n\r\nThe adherents of Virginia increased in strength at Pittsburgh, and it\r\nbecame impossible to collect taxes imposed by Pennsylvania. How these\r\ntroubles would have ended is unforeseen, for during the latter part of\r\n1774, the attention of all the western frontier was turned to the Indian\r\ninvasion, since known as Dunmore’s War.\r\n\r\nWhile this war was confined to the western border of Virginia, the\r\ninhabitants of Westmoreland County organized, under command of St.\r\nClair, assisted by Colonels Proctor and Lochrey and Captain James Smith,\r\nand put the frontier in a state of defense.\r\n\r\nOn February 7, 1775, by order of a Virginia magistrate, a man named\r\nBenjamin Harrison with an armed party broke open the jail at Hannastown\r\nand set free the prisoners. Robert Hanna, who was a magistrate, read to\r\nthem the riot act, but Harrison said he did not regard that act, or\r\nthose who read it, or those who made it. Two weeks later Hanna and\r\nanother magistrate, James Cavett, were arrested and confined in Fort\r\nDunmore, where they remained for months.\r\n\r\nThe controversy got into Congress, but the Revolution brought about a\r\nmore amicable feeling, and by 1779 the Virginians and Pennsylvanians\r\nagreed to a settlement.\r\n\r\nA commission surveyed the boundary by extending the Mason and Dixon’s\r\nline to its western limit of five degrees. There a meridian was drawn as\r\nfar north as the Ohio.\r\n\r\nCeding her western lands, north of the Ohio to Congress in 1784,\r\nVirginia had no further interest in the boundary and the next year\r\nPennsylvania alone extended the meridian to Lake Erie.\r\n\r\nAfter the Revolution, affairs in Western Pennsylvania were generally\r\npeaceful.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  First Members of Susquehanna Company\r\n                  Settle in Wyoming, February 8, 1769\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Proprietaries of Pennsylvania, determined to hold possession of\r\nlands in the Wyoming Valley, which were claimed by the Connecticut\r\nsettlers, sent Captain Amos Ogden, John Anderson, Charles Stewart,\r\nAlexander Patterson, John Jennings and several other Pennsylvanians and\r\nNew Jerseymen into that section with the intention of becoming lessees\r\nor purchasers of the proprietary lands at Wyoming.\r\n\r\nThey established themselves on Mill Creek, December, 1768, where they\r\nerected a small fort or blockhouse, this settlement being within the\r\nManor of Stoke, which had been located and surveyed for the\r\nProprietaries December 9 of that year.\r\n\r\nThe Susquehanna Company, which had been organized at Windham, Conn.,\r\nJuly 18, 1753, determined to take possession formally of the lands\r\nlocated at Wyoming, purchased by them from the Indians at Albany. The\r\nfirst forty settlers under this company arrived at Wyoming February 8,\r\n1769. A large body, led by Major John Durkee, with authority from the\r\nSusquehanna Company, arrived at Wyoming from Connecticut and New York\r\nMay 12, 1769. They immediately began the erection of about twenty\r\nsubstantial and commodious one-story log cabins. A few days later 150\r\nadditional settlers arrived.\r\n\r\nThe Connecticut settlers finished the erection of their first\r\ntwenty-five cabins by May 20 and a week later began the erection of the\r\nstockade to surround them, which, when completed, they named “Fort\r\nDurkee,” in honor of their leader, Major John Durkee.\r\n\r\nGovernor John Penn was immediately advised of the arrival of the\r\nConnecticut settlers, and he at once planned to discourage their\r\npermanent location and directed letters to Colonel Turbutt Francis, then\r\nin command of the small garrison of provincial troops stationed at Fort\r\nAugusta, and to John Jennings, of Bethlehem, Sheriff of Northampton\r\nCounty. These letters urged them to discourage unlawful settlements, but\r\nto use force, if necessary, to drive them off.\r\n\r\nMay 24 Sheriff Jennings arrived at Wyoming and read the Governor’s\r\nproclamation to the “intruders.”\r\n\r\nAn exciting occurrence took place when “Colonel Turbut Francis,\r\ncommanding a fine company from the city (Philadelphia), in full military\r\narray, with colors streaming and martial music, descended into the plain\r\nand sat down before Fort Durkee about the 20th of June, but finding the\r\nYankees too strongly fortified, returned to await re-enforcements below\r\nthe mountains.”\r\n\r\nAnother version of the affair is: “June 22 Colonel Francis, with sixty\r\nmen, in a hostile manner demanded a surrender of our houses and\r\npossessions. He embodied his forces within thirty or forty rods of their\r\n(the settlers) dwelling, threatened to fire their houses and kill our\r\npeople unless they surrendered and quitted their possessions, which they\r\nrefused to do; and after many terrible threatenings by him he withdrew.”\r\n\r\nSoon as Major Durkee, who had been in Easton on court business, returned\r\nto Wyoming and learned of the hostile demonstration of Colonel Francis\r\nand his small force he set about to strengthen the defenses of Fort\r\nDurkee. It was at this time, July 1, 1769, that the major compounded and\r\noriginated the almost unique name “Wilkes-Barre” and bestowed it upon\r\nthe settlement and territory at and immediately adjacent to Fort Durkee.\r\n\r\nGovernor Penn was fully aware that the Yankees were determined to keep\r\npossession of the lands upon which they were settled, and on August 24,\r\n1769, wrote to Colonel Francis at Fort Augusta, directing him to raise\r\nan expedition to assist the Sheriff of Northampton County in executing\r\nthe King’s writ, and concluded as follows: “It is hoped you will be able\r\nto procure the people to go without pay, as they have already manifested\r\na very good disposition to bring the intruders to justice.”\r\n\r\nThe attempt to serve these writs in September, 1769, precipitated the\r\nfirst of the so-called Pennamite-Yankee Wars. The Sheriff approached a\r\nnumber of the settlers at work, and they were attacked by men of his\r\nposse under the command of Amos and Nathan Ogden, and “several of the\r\nsettlers were beat and wounded.” This action and its results may be\r\nunderstood from a letter written to Governor Trumbull, of Connecticut:\r\n\r\n“In September Amos and Nathan Ogden, with twenty-six others armed with\r\npistols and clubs, assaulted and wounded sundry of our people, whereby\r\ntheir lives were endangered. The same month thirteen of our people in\r\nthree canoes loaded with wheat and flour, about sixty miles below\r\nWyoming, were met and robbed of their canoes and loading by thirty armed\r\nmen who came from Fort Augusta, about one-half mile away.\r\n\r\n“In the same month came the trial of many of our men at Easton; the\r\ncharge against them was riot. * * * In the course of the trial challenge\r\nwas made to a juryman for having some time before expressed an opinion\r\nopenly against our people; but neither that nor any other exception\r\nwould prevail. The jury were treated with wine by the King’s attorney\r\nbefore verdict, which verdict was brought in against the prisoners, and\r\nthey condemned them to pay a fine of £10 each, with large costs, in\r\nwhich was included the cost of the wine the jury were treated with.”\r\n\r\nSome paid the fine, others were imprisoned. These later escaped from\r\njail at Easton September 24, and a reward of £60 was offered by the\r\nsheriff for their apprehension. None of the twelve was captured, for\r\nthey all fled to Connecticut.\r\n\r\nAnother skirmish took place in November, 1769, between the Yankee\r\nsettlers at Fort Durkee and a small party of Pennsylvanians under the\r\ncommand of the Ogdens.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of November 11 Captain Ogden, apprised of the approach\r\nof Sheriff Jennings and his “posse comitatus,” gathered together his\r\nwhole force of Pennamites, numbering about forty, and dashed rapidly and\r\nunexpectedly on a small party of Yankees, among whom was Major Durkee,\r\nand captured them.\r\n\r\nCaptain Ogden, also a justice of the peace, prepared legal papers for\r\nthe commitment of Major Durkee in the city jail at Philadelphia,\r\nshackled him with irons and sent him under heavy escort to Philadelphia,\r\nwhere he was imprisoned. Emboldened by their success, Ogden and his men\r\nthat night surrounded Fort Durkee and fired upon the men within.\r\n\r\nSheriff Jennings and his posse arrived upon the scene the next morning\r\n(Sunday) and paraded the whole body of Pennamites, about 200 in number,\r\nbefore Fort Durkee. While Jennings was carrying on a parley with the\r\nYankee garrison, Ogden and a party drove off all the horses and cattle\r\nbelonging to the Yankees.\r\n\r\nThe following day the Pennamites assembled in front of Fort Durkee,\r\nwhere they threw up breastworks, upon which they mounted a four-pounder\r\nbrought from Fort Augusta. They demanded the surrender of the fort, or\r\nits destruction. Deprived of their commander and having nothing but\r\nrifles, the Yankees agreed to sign articles of capitulation.\r\n\r\nBy the terms of this agreement all but fourteen of the settlers were to\r\nleave the region within three days; the others were allowed to remain\r\nand live at Fort Durkee until His Majesty’s decree should determine who\r\nhad proper title to the lands at Wyoming.\r\n\r\nOgden and his men, however, starved out the fourteen settlers who\r\nremained, and in a short time they were compelled to follow their\r\ncompanions in exile.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               John Penn, Last of Proprietary Governors,\r\n                         Died February 9, 1795\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Penn, son of Richard, and grandson of William Penn, the founder,\r\narrived in Philadelphia October 30, 1763, and assumed the duties of\r\nDeputy Governor.\r\n\r\nJohn was the eldest son of Richard, and was born in England in 1728. At\r\nthe age of twenty-five, he first visited the Province of Pennsylvania,\r\nand ten years later, he came bearing the commission of Deputy Governor.\r\nThe day he arrived to assume his office was on Sunday, and was marked by\r\nthe shock of an earthquake, which the superstitious interpreted as an\r\nevil omen to his administration.\r\n\r\nAt the time of his appointment as Governor, his father was proprietor of\r\none-third of the Province, and his uncle, Thomas, of two-thirds, the\r\nlatter having inherited the share of John, the oldest of the three\r\noriginal proprietors, upon the occasion of his death in 1746.\r\n\r\nWhen John Penn arrived as Deputy Governor he was received with great\r\ndemonstrations of respect, and many entertainments were given in his\r\nhonor, one of which was a civic feast which cost £203 17s.\r\n\r\nThe administration of John Penn began when the Province was in the\r\nthroes of the terrible Pontiac War, and the condition along the frontier\r\nwas deplorable. The “Paxtang Boys” soon thereafter murdered the Moravian\r\nIndians in the work house at Conestoga, and Governor Penn issued several\r\nproclamations, offering rewards for the chief actors in that affair.\r\n\r\nOn July 7, 1765, Governor Penn again declared war against the Shawnee\r\nand Delaware Indians, and sent Colonel Bouquet to Fort Pitt, who subdued\r\nthe savages.\r\n\r\nOn March 22, 1765, the obnoxious Stamp Act was passed by the British\r\nParliament, and the real troubles for Governor Penn began in earnest.\r\nThis in addition to the long controversy with the Government of\r\nConnecticut over the claims of the Susquehanna Company for lands in the\r\nSusquehanna Valley.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1771 Governor Penn was called to England by the death of his\r\nfather, leaving the government of the Province in the hands of the\r\nCouncil, of which James Hamilton was President, who thus for the third\r\ntime became in effect Governor.\r\n\r\nOn October 17, 1771, Richard Penn, second son of the late Richard,\r\narrived in the Province, bearing the commission of Lieutenant Governor.\r\nHis administration was marked by the troubles with the Connecticut\r\nsettlers, which extended throughout his administration, a little less\r\nthan two years.\r\n\r\nHe was well fitted by nature and education to serve as Governor and when\r\nhis commission was unexpectedly revoked August 30, 1773, there was much\r\ngenuine regret among the people of the Province.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1772, he married Miss Mary Masters, of Philadelphia, and on\r\nbeing superseded as Governor, he became a member of Council.\r\n\r\nA few months later the merchants presented him with an address and\r\ninvited him to dine with them. He had acted with prudence and manliness\r\nin difficult times, and the people believed in him.\r\n\r\nGovernor John Penn was present at the dinner. Robert Morris, who\r\npresided, placed one on his right and the other on his left, but the\r\nbrothers did not speak. Richard had been deprived of his office without\r\ncause and he resented it. However, Richard was induced to execute in\r\nMay, 1774, a release of his claim, and a reconciliation took place when\r\nJohn appointed him naval officer, and Richard, accepting the position,\r\ncalled to thank him.\r\n\r\nRichard was intimate with members of the Continental Congress and when,\r\nin 1775, he returned to England, he was intrusted with the last petition\r\nfrom the Colonies ever presented to the King. He was examined respecting\r\nAmerican affairs at the bar of the House of Lords and gave testimony so\r\nfavorable to the Colonial cause that he incurred the displeasure of the\r\nPeers.\r\n\r\nUpon the death of his father, February 4, 1771, Governor John Penn\r\ninherited the one-third of the Proprietary interest.\r\n\r\nSoon after John Penn again assumed the gubernatorial powers his\r\nattention was directed to Indian hostilities on the western border of\r\nthe Province. Then soon came the harsh measures adopted by Parliament\r\ntoward the Massachusetts Colony, especially toward the town of Boston.\r\n\r\nA public meeting was held in Philadelphia, but the Governor refused to\r\nconvene the Assembly, and another meeting was held, at which nearly 8000\r\npersons were present and John Dickinson and Thomas Willing presided.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of these meetings was a movement to urge the convening of a\r\nContinental Congress and committees to that end were appointed. The\r\nfirst Continental Congress met in Philadelphia, September 4, 1774.\r\n\r\nWithout manifesting partisan zeal, Governor Penn was believed to\r\nsympathize with the Colonies, though he mildly remonstrated against the\r\nsystem of congressional rather than Colonial action.\r\n\r\nDuring the stirring times of the early days of the Revolution, Governor\r\nPenn was only a witness to the proceedings in the province he claimed as\r\nhis own.\r\n\r\nOn September 28, 1776, the Assembly, which had existed for nearly a\r\ncentury under the organic law of William Penn, ceased to exist, and John\r\nPenn was shorn of his power as Proprietary Governor of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nAfter he was superseded in authority by the Supreme Executive Council,\r\nhe seems to have submitted gracefully to the progress of events, which\r\nhe found himself unable to control, and remained during the Revolution a\r\nquiet spectator of the long struggle without manifesting any particular\r\ninterest in its result.\r\n\r\nHe married Anne Allen, daughter of William Allen, Chief Justice of the\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\nIn person he is described as of middle size, reserved in manners and\r\nvery nearsighted.\r\n\r\nWhen Howe sailed with his army from New York to make a mighty effort to\r\nend the Revolution by capturing Philadelphia, the Continental Congress,\r\nJuly 31, 1777, recommended to the Government of Pennsylvania to make\r\nprisoners of such of the Crown and proprietary officers as were\r\ndisaffected.\r\n\r\nAccordingly a warrant was made out for the apprehension of the former\r\nGovernor, John Penn, and his Chief Justice, Benjamin Chew. Some of the\r\nCity Troop made the arrest.\r\n\r\nBoth Penn and Chew refused to sign any parole, and they were taken to\r\nFredericksburg, Va., under care of an officer and six of the troopers.\r\nThey were soon paroled and resided at the Union Iron Works until May 15,\r\n1778, when Congress discharged them from their parole.\r\n\r\nPenn continued to reside in Bucks County, where he died February 9,\r\n1795. He was buried in the aisle of Christ Church in front of the\r\nchancel, nineteen feet from the north wall. He was sixty-seven years\r\nold.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Munley and McAllister, Mollie Maguires,\r\n                  Arrested for Murder of Thomas Sanger\r\n                       and William Uren, February\r\n\r\n10, 1876\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas Munley and Charles McAllister were arrested February 10, 1876,\r\ncharged with the murder of Thomas Sanger and William Uren, at Raven’s\r\nRun, near Ashland, Wednesday, September 1, 1875.\r\n\r\nThese two Mollie Maguires were brought to trial in June 1876, at\r\nPottsville. Munley was tried first, before Judge D. B. Green, and a\r\nverdict of guilty of murder in the first degree was returned July 12.\r\n\r\nIt was in this case that Hon. Franklin B. Gowen, assisting the\r\nprosecution, made his memorable address against the Mollie Maguires.\r\n\r\nTo return to the crime, which followed in two weeks the murders of Gomer\r\nJames and Squire Gwyther.\r\n\r\nFacts brought to light by James McParlan, the Pinkerton detective, who\r\njoined the Mollies under the name of James McKenna and lived among them\r\nuntil he collected sufficient evidence to send so many to the gallows\r\nthat they ceased to function as an organization, are as follows:\r\n\r\nOn the eventful morning, Hiram Beninger, a carpenter connected with the\r\ncolliery owned by Heaton & Company, near Ashland, was on his way to\r\nwork, when he noticed two strangers sitting on some lumber near the\r\ncarpenter shop, but such being a common occurrence he passed by, but\r\nremembered their personal appearance. John Nicolls noticed three\r\nstrangers resting on some idle trucks as he passed by to enter the\r\ncolliery, one of whom addressed him, when he returned the salutation and\r\nalmost immediately noticed the two others, where the carpenter found\r\nthem. He also remembered how they were dressed, and the fact that they\r\nspoke to him, he could recall many details in their clothing and\r\npersonal appearance.\r\n\r\nAbout fifteen minutes afterward Thomas Sanger, a boss in Heaton &\r\nCompany’s colliery, accompanied by William Uren, a miner, who boarded in\r\nhis family and who was employed in the same mine, came along the road,\r\ncarrying their dinner pails in their hands.\r\n\r\nSanger was a man greatly respected by his employes and neighbors, about\r\nthirty-three years of age, and while he had long been in the employ of\r\nthe firm, he had failed to make any enemies, excepting among the\r\nMollies. He had been several times threatened, but more recently\r\nbelieved the anger of his organized enemies was buried, forgotten, or\r\nappeased. This proved to be a great mistake.\r\n\r\nSanger and his companion had not gone far from the Sanger home, when\r\nthey were both fired upon and both mortally wounded, by the same strange\r\nmen noticed by the carpenter and Nicolls.\r\n\r\nBeninger heard the shots, and rushed out of the shop, and saw Mr. Robert\r\nHeaton, one of the proprietors of the colliery, firing his pistol at and\r\nrunning after two of the murderers.\r\n\r\nTwo of the five assassins at this moment stopped in the flight, turned\r\nand fired their revolvers at Heaton, but without hitting him. Mr. Heaton\r\nboldly stood his ground and continued to empty his revolver at the\r\nstrangers.\r\n\r\nThe five men then quickly turned and ran up the mountains. Heaton\r\nfollowed and when opportunity offered he continued to fire at them, but\r\napparently none was wounded.\r\n\r\nIt was this dogged and determined courage of Mr. Heaton which made him a\r\nmarked man for the nefarious organization of murderers, and which\r\neventually drove him from the coal regions to reside elsewhere.\r\n\r\nHad any of the others who witnessed the exchange of shots between Mr.\r\nHeaton and the Mollies been armed and helped in the uneven chase, some\r\nof them might have been killed or captured.\r\n\r\nThe assassins made good their escape in the timber and bushes of the\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nBoth Sanger and Uren were removed to the home of a neighbor named\r\nWheevil, where every attention was given them. Mrs. Sanger soon arrived\r\nand almost immediately that a physician came into the house Sanger\r\nexpired. Uren, who had been shot in the right groin, about same place as\r\nSanger had been hit, lingered until next day, when he died. Neither man\r\nretained consciousness long enough to give any coherent description of\r\nthe manner in which they had been attacked.\r\n\r\nMr. Heaton was eating his breakfast when he heard the firing, and at\r\nonce his mind reverted to the men he had seen sitting by the carpenter\r\nshop. He seized his pistol and ran out of the house. He first saw\r\nSanger, groaning on the ground, who said: “Don’t stop for me, Bob, but\r\ngive it to them!”\r\n\r\nHeaton then gave the chase, as before related.\r\n\r\nA young Williams, who wanted to join Heaton in pursuit, was prevented by\r\nhis mother, but they both saw the men attack Sanger and were able to\r\nrelate the manner in which the cold-blooded murder was committed.\r\n\r\nThe careful description of the story of this murder as related in the\r\nShenandoah Herald, gave McParlan the clue which he pursued in running\r\ndown the murderers. It was at this time that he was believed to be the\r\nworst Mollie in the world and was in constant danger of being killed by\r\npeople who did not know his true character.\r\n\r\nOn February 10, 1875, Captain R. J. Linden, a fellow Pinkerton operative\r\nwith McParlan, captured Thomas Munley at his home in Gilberton. Charles\r\nMcAllister was apprehended at the same time.\r\n\r\nMcAllister demanded a separate trial and George Kaercher, Esq., the\r\nDistrict Attorney, elected to try Munley first.\r\n\r\nMcParlan voluntarily testified in the case, and his evidence was so\r\naccurate and convincing that no other verdict could be possible.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful address of Mr. Gowen, and those of General Charles\r\nAlbright, Hon. F. W. Hughes, and Guy E. Farquhar, Esq., added just the\r\nargument which the jury required to find a just verdict of “guilty of\r\nmurder in the first degree.”\r\n\r\nIn November McAllister was convicted.\r\n\r\nMunley was hanged in the Pottsville jail August 16, 1876, and McAllister\r\nwas hanged later.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                First Anthracite Coal Burned in Grate by\r\n\r\nJudge Jesse Fell, February 11, 1808\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first knowledge of anthracite in America dates back to about 1750 or\r\n1755, when an Indian brought a supply of it to a gunsmith at Nazareth\r\nfor repairing his rifle, the smith’s supply of charcoal having become\r\nexhausted.\r\n\r\nStone coal was used by the garrison at Fort Augusta, mention of which\r\nfact is made by Colonel William Plunket, who was one of the original\r\nsoldiers sent to build this important provincial fortress. The records\r\nin the British War Office also contain references to its use there.\r\n\r\nA certain Ensign Holler, of the fort’s garrison, wrote that in the\r\nwinter of 1758 the house was heated by stone coal brought down the river\r\nfrom near Nanticoke and that a wagon load had been brought from a place\r\nsix leagues from Fort Augusta, which point must have been at or near\r\neither the present Shamokin or Mount Carmel.\r\n\r\nAnthracite had been used in the Wyoming Valley before 1755, and during\r\nthe Revolutionary War it was shipped down the Susquehanna for the use of\r\nthe arsenal at Carlisle.\r\n\r\nOn November 25, 1780, the Congress “Resolved, That all the artificers in\r\nthe department of military stores in Pennsylvania be removed to Carlisle\r\nand that in the future only an issuing store and an elaboratory fixing\r\nammunition be kept in Philadelphia.”\r\n\r\nImmediately thereafter Colonel Blaine was directed to prepare stores,\r\netc., for the troops, and during the month of December of 1780 nearly\r\nall the artificers were sent to Carlisle.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that coal from Wyoming was there used in the casting\r\nof cannon, as it could have been more readily brought down the\r\nSusquehanna in bateaux than hauled from the seaports for that purpose.\r\nIt is also well known that provisions were taken up the Susquehanna, and\r\nas coal was then known and probably mined, the bateaux in returning\r\nevidently conveyed the fuel to Kelso’s ferry, opposite Harrisburg.\r\n\r\nThe barracks erected by the Hessian soldiers captured by General\r\nWashington at the battle of Trenton, and sent to Carlisle as prisoners\r\nof war, later became one of the historic buildings of Pennsylvania. The\r\nbuilding was one long used by the Carlisle Indian School and is still\r\nstanding on the Government reservation there.\r\n\r\nPittsburgh, too, had used fuel dug from a high bluff before the town.\r\nCoal was known to have existed near the present City of Pottsville as\r\nearly as 1790, when Nicho Allen is said to have discovered some of the\r\nblack stones and tested their burning qualities.\r\n\r\nAn act approved by the Legislature of Pennsylvania, March 15, 1784, was\r\n“for the purpose of improving the navigation of the Schuylkill so as to\r\nmake it passable at all times, enabling the inhabitants to bring their\r\nproduce to market, furnishing the county adjoining the same and the City\r\nof Philadelphia with coal, masts, boards,” etc.\r\n\r\nIn 1766 a company of Nanticoke and Mohican Indians visited Philadelphia\r\nand reported to the Governor that there were mines in Wyoming. A survey\r\nof Wyoming in 1768 notes “stone coal” near the mouth of Toby’s Creek.\r\nOne of General Sullivan’s officers in 1779 records the presence of “vast\r\nmines of coal, pewter, lead and copperas.”\r\n\r\nObadiah Gore used coal in his blacksmith forge as early as 1769. He also\r\nused it in nailing in 1788.\r\n\r\nThe Conestoga wagons might have transported the products of the farm to\r\nmarket for many years more had not Philip Ginter, the hunter, in 1791\r\ndiscovered “stone coals” under the roots of a fallen tree nine miles\r\nwest of Mauch Chunk.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time that Ginter made his discovery coal was discovered\r\nby Isaac Tomlinson at what is now Shamokin. He had recently removed on a\r\nfarm between there and Mount Carmel and found the coals lying in the bed\r\nof Quaker Run, a stream running through his farm and so called because\r\nhe was a member of the Society of Friends.\r\n\r\nThus we see that the three discoverers of anthracite were Allen, Ginter\r\nand Tomlinson, and what is more remarkable, all these discoveries were\r\nmade about the same time, and yet it is a fact that coal was mined at\r\nWyoming nearly a quarter century before these “discoveries.”\r\n\r\nPhilip Ginter did not exactly “discover anthracite.” He knew all about\r\nthe existence of coal at Wyoming and something of its use. But his\r\ndiscovery of coal in 1791 while hunting on the mountains where is now\r\nSummit Hill is the date from which the great business of the Lehigh Coal\r\nand Navigation Company originated, though it was twenty-nine years\r\nbefore the coal trade really began.\r\n\r\nThe date is usually accepted as 1820, the time that the Lehigh schemes\r\ngot into action.\r\n\r\nGinter made known his discovery to Colonel Jacob Weiss, residing at what\r\nis now known as Weissport, who took a sample in his saddlebags to\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\nBut the coal trade was active in Wyoming Valley as early as 1807, when\r\nthe Smiths shipped a boat load to Columbia. George H. Hollenback shipped\r\ntwo loads down the river in 1813, and sent coal by wagon to\r\nPhiladelphia. Lord Butler and Crandall Wilcox both shipped coal in 1814.\r\n\r\nThe use of anthracite for domestic purposes seems to have been\r\ndiscovered by Judge Jesse Fell, of Wilkes-Barre. The following\r\nmemorandum was made at the time on the fly-leaf of one of his books:\r\n\r\n“February 11, 1808, made the experiment of burning the common stone coal\r\nof the valley in a grate, in a common fireplace in my house, and found\r\nit will answer the purpose of fuel, making a clearer and better fire, at\r\nless expense, than burning wood in the common way. Jesse Fell.”\r\n\r\nNews of this successful experiment soon spread through the town and\r\ncountry, and people flocked to witness the discovery. Similar grates\r\nwere soon constructed by Judge Fell’s neighbors, and in a short time\r\nwere in general use throughout the valley.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of that year, John and Abijah Smith loaded two arks with\r\ncoal at Ransoms Creek, in Plymouth, and took it down the river to\r\nColumbia; but on offering it for sale, no person could be induced to\r\npurchase. They were compelled to leave the black stones behind them\r\nunsold, when they returned to their homes.\r\n\r\nThe next year the Smiths, not in the least discouraged, took two arks of\r\ncoal and a grate, and again proceeded to Columbia. The grate was put up,\r\nand the coals were burned in it, thus proving the practicability of\r\nusing coal as a fuel. The result was a sale of the coal, and thus began\r\nthe initiative of the immense coal trade of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Quakers Make Protest Against Slavery to\r\n                       Congress February 12, 1790\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is unmistakable evidence of Negro slavery among the Dutch on the\r\nSouth (now Delaware) River as early as the year 1639. In that year a\r\nconvict from Manhattan was sentenced to serve with the blacks on that\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nIn September and October, 1664, the English defeated the Dutch, and some\r\nof the Dutch soldiers were sold in Virginia as slaves. The Negro slaves\r\nwere also confiscated by the victors and sold. A cargo of three hundred\r\nof those unhappy beings having just landed, failed to escape capture.\r\n\r\nIn 1688 Pastorius, the Op den Graffs (now Updegraffs), and Gerhardt\r\nHendricks sent to the Friends’ meeting house the first public protest\r\never made on this continent against the holding of slaves, or as they\r\nuncompromisingly styled it, “the traffick of men’s body.”\r\n\r\nThese early residents of Germantown compared Negro slavery to slavery\r\nunder Turkish pirates, and failed to note that one was better than the\r\nother. Their protest said:\r\n\r\n“There is a saying that we shall doe to all men licke as we will be done\r\nourselves; making no difference of what generation, descent, or colour\r\nthey are. And those who steal or robb men, and those who buy or purchase\r\nthem, are they not all alicke? Here is liberty of Conscience, which is\r\nright and reasonable; here ought to be likewise liberty of ye body,\r\nexcept of evil doers, which is another case. In Europe there are many\r\noppressed for Conscience sake; and here there are those oppressed which\r\nare of a black colour.”\r\n\r\nThis memorial is believed to be in the handwriting of Francis Daniel\r\nPastorius, and at the date it was written New England was doing a large\r\nbusiness in the Guinea trade, the slave depots being located chiefly at\r\nNewport, where the gangs for the Southern market were arranged.\r\n\r\nAll honor is due these honest first settlers of Germantown, who asked\r\ncategorically: “Have these Negers not as much right to fight for their\r\nfreedom as you have to keep them slaves?”\r\n\r\nThey asked, further, to be informed what right Christians have to\r\nmaintain slavery, “to the end we shall be satisfied on this point and\r\nsatisfy likewise our good friends and acquaintances in our natif\r\ncountry, to whom it is a fairfull thing that men should be handled so in\r\nPennsilvania.”\r\n\r\nThe Quakers were embarrassed by the memorial and its blunt style of\r\ninterrogatory. It was submitted to the Monthly Meeting at Dublin\r\nTownship, “inspected” and found so “weighty” that it was passed on to\r\nthe Philadelphia Quarterly Meeting, which “recommended” it to the Yearly\r\nMeeting at Burlington, where it was adjudged “not to be so proper for\r\nthis meeting to give a positive judgment in the case, it having so\r\ngeneral a relation to many other parts, and, therefore, at present they\r\nforebore it.” So the matter slept.\r\n\r\nVery soon thereafter slavery in Philadelphia was not very different from\r\nwhat it was in the South at a later period. The white mechanics and\r\nlaborers complained to the authorities that their wages were reduced by\r\nthe competition of Negroes hired out by their owners, and the owners\r\nobjected to the capital punishment of slaves for crime, as thereby their\r\nproperty would be destroyed.\r\n\r\nIn 1708 two slaves, Tony and Quashy, were sentenced to death for\r\nburglary, but their owners were allowed to sell them out of the province\r\nafter a severe flogging had been given them upon the streets on three\r\nsuccessive market days.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly of Pennsylvania soon viewed with much concern and\r\napprehension the introduction of so many slaves into the province, but\r\nthe House would not consider any proposition to free Negroes, deciding\r\nthat to attempt to do so would be “neither just nor convenient,” but it\r\ndid resolve to discourage the introduction of Negroes from Africa and\r\nthe West Indies. It laid a tax of £20 a head upon all such importations.\r\nThe Queen and Royal Council failed to approve the act, for the British\r\nGovernment was set like flint against any provincial attempt to arrest\r\nthe African slave trade or tax it out of existence—that trade was a\r\nroyal perquisite.\r\n\r\nThe year 1780 is memorable in the annals of Pennsylvania for the passage\r\nof an act for the gradual abolition of slavery in this State. On\r\nFebruary 5, 1780, the Supreme Executive Council in its message to the\r\nAssembly, called the attention of that body to this subject, and\r\nalthough it was forcibly presented, the matter was dismissed, “as the\r\nConstitution would not allow them to receive the law from the Council.”\r\n\r\nOn March 1, 1780, by a vote of thirty-four to twenty-one, an abolition\r\nact passed the Assembly. It provided for the registration of every Negro\r\nor mulatto slave or servant for life, or till the age of thirty-one\r\nyears, before the first of November following, and also provided “that\r\nno man or woman of any nation or color except the Negroes or mulattoes\r\nwho shall be registered as aforesaid, shall at any time hereafter be\r\ndeemed, or adjudged, or holden within the territory of this\r\nCommonwealth, as slaves or servants for life, but as free men and free\r\nwomen.”\r\n\r\nThe Quakers partly forgot their woes on hearing of an act which they so\r\nmuch approved, as in 1774 the Pennsylvania Yearly Meeting had taken a\r\ndefinite and decided stand against slavery.\r\n\r\nThey proceeded without delay to urge war on the system.\r\n\r\nOn February 12, 1790, the Quakers made their first formal protest to\r\nCongress for the abolition of slavery in every form.\r\n\r\nThe movement against slavery had been making quiet progress during all\r\nthese years, and on January 1, 1794, a convention was held in\r\nPhiladelphia by invitation of the Pennsylvania Abolition Society, of\r\ndelegates from all societies throughout the United States.\r\n\r\nAt this convention two memorials were adopted, one to the Legislature of\r\nPennsylvania, and the other to Congress, asking for suitable laws to\r\nsuppress the slave trade.\r\n\r\nThe petition to Congress was referred to a committee, which made a\r\nreport recommending the passage of a law against the fitting out of any\r\nship or vessel in any port of the United States, or by foreigners, for\r\nthe purpose of procuring from any part of the coast of Africa the\r\ninhabitants of the said country, to be transshipped into any foreign\r\nports or places of the world to be sold or disposed of as slaves. The\r\nlaw was finally passed on March 22, 1794, and vessels were thereafter\r\nliable to heavy fine and forfeiture, and the freedom of the slaves on\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nThus after the taunt of the early German settlers, the Quakers cleared\r\ntheir own skirts and then led in the movement which abolished slaves\r\nfrom Pennsylvania and were the first to lay this great question before\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 First Magazine in America Published in\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, February 13, 1741\r\n\r\n\r\nThere has been recent controversy, especially among New York newspapers,\r\nregarding the oldest magazine in America, one such newspaper concluding\r\nthat the oldest such publication was Oliver Oldschool’s “Portfolio,”\r\npublished by Bradford and Inskeep, of Philadelphia, and Inskeep and\r\nBradford, in New York, 1809–1810.\r\n\r\nThat is not the fact and Pennsylvania cannot be denied the honor of\r\nbeing the home of the earliest magazine published on this continent.\r\n\r\nOn November 6, 1740, Andrew Bradford’s “Mercury,” published in\r\nPhiladelphia, contained a two page editorial which must surely have\r\ncaused some sensation, heralding as it did a genuine innovation.\r\n\r\n“’Tis not in mortals to command success,” and if the innovator in this\r\ncase failed, he was at least the first to make the attempt, not alone in\r\nPhiladelphia, but throughout America.\r\n\r\nThe editorial plunged headlong into the business at hand as follows:\r\n\r\n“The PLAN of an intended MAGAZINE.”\r\n\r\n“The Success and Approbation which the Magazines, published in Great\r\nBritain, have met with for many years past among all Ranks and Degrees\r\nof People, Encouraged us to Attempt a Work of the like Nature in\r\nAmerica. But the Plan on which we intend to proceed, being in many\r\nrespects different from the British Models, it therefore becomes\r\nnecessary, in the first Place, to lay before the Reader a general\r\nProspect of the present Design.\r\n\r\n“It is proposed to publish Monthly, ‘An Account of the Publick Affairs\r\ntransacted in His Majesty’s Colonies, as well on the Continent of\r\nAmerica, as well as in the West India Islands,’ and at the end of each\r\nsession, ‘an Extract of the Laws therein passed, with the Reasons on\r\nwhich they were founded, the Grievances intended to be Remedied by them,\r\nand the Benefits expected from them.”\r\n\r\nThe prospectus then proceeds to apologize beforehand for “the mistakes\r\nwhich will probably be committed in handling so great a Variety of\r\nMatter.” It sketches the general lines of the future magazine in regard\r\nto “remarkable Trials as well Civil as Criminal,” also the “Course of\r\nExchange, Party-Disputes, Free Inquiry into all sorts of Subjects, its\r\nviews of the Liberty and Licentiousness of the Press, its contempt for\r\nthe rude Clamours of envious Ignorance,’ and the ‘base suggestions of\r\nthe Malevolence’,” and then terminates as follows:\r\n\r\n“To conclude, the Reader is desired to consider the Undertaking as an\r\nattempt to Erect on Neutral Principles A PUBLIC THEATRE in the Center of\r\nthe British Empire in America, on which the most remarkable Transactions\r\nof each Government may be impartially represented, and fairly exhibited\r\nto the View of all His Majesty’s Subjects, whether at Home or abroad,\r\nwho are disposed to be Spectators.\r\n\r\n           “This is TRUE Liberty, when freeborn Men,\r\n           Having to advise the Publick, may speak free,\r\n           Which he who can, and will, deserves high Praise;\r\n           Who neither can, nor will, may hold his Peace;\r\n           What can be juster in a State than this?\r\n\r\n“From Euripides, by Milton, for a motto to his Vindication of the\r\nSubject’s Right to the Liberty of the Press.”\r\n\r\nThe first number of this, The American Magazine, was to be published “in\r\nMarch next, if by that Time there are a Sufficient Number of\r\nSubscriptions.”\r\n\r\nBut something went wrong with the plans. The very week following this\r\nannouncement, out came Benjamin Franklin with the charge that this\r\nscheme now put forth by John Webbe and Bradford was really his own,\r\n“Communicated in Confidence,” to the said Webbe, who was to be the\r\neditor of his magazine.\r\n\r\nWebbe was not slow to indignantly repudiate the charge, and an unseemly\r\ncontroversy followed between the two rival printing houses, which, no\r\ndoubt, interfered considerably with the ultimate result or their\r\nrespective ventures.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, “The American Magazine, or a monthly view of the\r\nPolitical State of the British Colonies,” 8vo size, price eight pence\r\nsterling, made its appearance, not in March as advertised and expected,\r\nbut on February 13, 1741.\r\n\r\nThus the first magazine in America made its initial bow to the public,\r\nand only three days later, Franklin’s press brought out “The General\r\nMagazine and Historical Chronicle, for All the British Plantations in\r\nAmerica.”\r\n\r\nBoth of these periodicals were advertised as monthly publications, and\r\nthe Mercury carried a small advertisement March 19, which announced the\r\nissuance of “The American Magazine” for February; but alas! that is the\r\nlast we read of Andrew Bradford’s pioneer magazine publication.\r\n\r\nFranklin’s “General Magazine” reached its sixth month of existence,\r\nafter which it simply ceased, no explanation of its discontinuance, not\r\na semblance of a valedictory appeared in “The Gazette,” where its\r\nmonthly advent had been so well heralded and advertised.\r\n\r\nThe name of these original “magazines” naturally suggests to the\r\npresent-day reader a very incorrect idea of their general appearance and\r\ncontents, thanks to the luxurious works of art that American enterprise\r\nhas put into publications now classed as magazines.\r\n\r\nFranklin’s magazine, for example, had but one illustration, and a poor\r\none at that, a representation of the Prince of Wales’ feathers and the\r\nmotto “Ich dien” on its front page.\r\n\r\nIt was only a 12mo; yet under existing conditions the labor of filling\r\nseventy-six pages with small print month after month and the neat manner\r\nin which the work was performed reflect the highest credit upon the\r\npublisher and was deserving of more favorable circumstances. The\r\ncontents of each number bear a favorable comparison with the best\r\nmagazines of today.\r\n\r\nDr. William Smith, provost of the University of Pennsylvania, soon\r\nmanifested a practical interest in intellectual affairs in the province\r\nin an effort to found a literary review called “The American Magazine\r\nand Monthly Chronicle for the British Colonies.”\r\n\r\nThe first number appeared October, 1757, and was printed by William\r\nBradford, presumably for “a society of gentlemen,” which in truth\r\nconsisted of Dr. Smith and several of his pupils in the college. This\r\nperiodical was principally devoted to political matters, literary\r\ndiscussions and poetry. It was discontinued November 14, 1758, and\r\nPennsylvania had not yet had a successful magazine.\r\n\r\nBetween 1741 and the close of the century nearly fifty magazines were\r\nborn in America, only deservedly to die. Philadelphia and Boston\r\nstruggled for literary supremacy, yet the four magazines of today which\r\nmay be called the veterans of the field are the North American Review,\r\nHarper’s, and Scribner’s, each published in New York, and the Atlantic,\r\npublished in Boston.\r\n\r\nBut Philadelphia was long the home of three widely circulated\r\nmagazines—Graham’s, Peterson’s and Godey’s Lady’s Book. The last named\r\nwas perhaps the most famous, established in July, 1830, by Louis A.\r\nGodey, and it reached the enormous circulation of 150,000 a month in the\r\nheyday of its prosperity.\r\n\r\nIf the Saturday Evening Post is regarded as a magazine, Philadelphia is\r\ntoday the home of the oldest and largest in the world.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             Christopher L. Sholes, Inventor of Typewriter,\r\n                      Born in Mooresburg, February\r\n                                14, 1819\r\n\r\n\r\nMore than a score of attempts, both in this country and abroad, were\r\nmade to perfect a typewriter after the birth of the idea in the mind of\r\nHenry Mill, an English engineer, who obtained a patent from Queen Ann of\r\nEngland, January 1, 1714, but none was successful.\r\n\r\nIt remained for an humble country boy, a printer, by the name of\r\nChristopher Latham Sholes, who was born in the little village of\r\nMooresburg, Montour County, Pennsylvania, February 14, 1819, to perfect\r\na model in the winter of 1866–67, which, after later improvements, was\r\nthe basis for the typewriting machines which are now so much a part of\r\ncommercial life throughout the world.\r\n\r\nThe patent granted to Henry Mill by Queen Ann never availed the\r\nimaginative engineer anything, because he lacked the essential ability\r\nto perfect a model which might be manufactured on a commercial basis. It\r\nis true, nevertheless, that he had the idea for a “writing machine for\r\nthe impressing or transcribing of letters singly or progressively one\r\nafter the other,” but this was not sufficient to be practical in any\r\nsense of the term.\r\n\r\nThe same difficulty that beset Mill prevented others from attaining\r\nsuccess, and it was a century and a half before the actual birth of a\r\ncommercial typewriter.\r\n\r\nThis interesting event was enacted in a small machine shop in the\r\noutskirts of Milwaukee. An interesting history was published recently by\r\nthe Herkimer County (New York) Historical Society in commemoration of\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the manufacture of the first typewriter for\r\ncommercial use. According to this story the principals were Carlos\r\nGliden, the son of a successful iron monger of Ohio, who was engaged in\r\ndeveloping a mechanical plow; Samuel W. Soule and Christopher Latham\r\nSholes, both printers, who were engaged in developing a machine for\r\nnumbering serially the pages of blank books, etc.\r\n\r\nSholes was the central figure in the association subsequently formed\r\namong the three. Sholes began his active life as an apprentice in the\r\noffice of the Danville, Pa., Intelligencer.\r\n\r\nThe Intelligencer was then the oldest paper in Montour County, founded\r\nin 1828 by Valentine Best. At the time of Sholes’ apprenticeship the\r\nnewspaper was a leading Democratic organ. The Intelligencer office was\r\nan excellent school for a boy when Christopher Sholes became the “devil”\r\nand began the career which was to stamp him as one of the great\r\ninventors of the country.\r\n\r\nThomas Chalfant purchased the property July 15, 1861. He was a prominent\r\nDemocratic politician, serving as member of the Legislature and as State\r\nSenator. He was a Civil War veteran and many years postmaster at\r\nDanville. Through all his various offices Chalfant devoted much time to\r\nhis newspaper.\r\n\r\nSholes was diligent and progressed in his chosen profession, becoming in\r\nturn, editor of several newspapers and ultimately an owner. In 1866 he\r\nwas collector of the port of Milwaukee and had held other public\r\noffices, including State Senator and Assemblyman.\r\n\r\nSholes’ subsequent invention of the typewriter is ascribed to\r\ninspiration he and Glidden obtained from a description of a machine\r\ninvented by John Pratt, of Alabama, which, however, was very crude and\r\nimpracticable.\r\n\r\nThe three friends engaged the services of skilled mechanics to help them\r\nin the construction of their typewriter, the first working model of\r\nwhich was completed in that small Milwaukee shop in the fall of 1866,\r\nbut it was not until the following June that a patent was obtained for\r\nthe invention.\r\n\r\nThis original machine had innumerable defects and was a crude and\r\ncumbersome affair, but it wrote accurately and rapidly, and after all\r\nthat was their objective.\r\n\r\nSholes was the one of the trio who did most to produce this machine, and\r\nwhile he was not satisfied, he soon scored a notable triumph and made\r\nthe machine its own best advertiser. A number of letters were written\r\nwith it, among them one to James Densmore, then a resident of Meadville,\r\nPa. Densmore was immediately interested. Like Sholes and Soule, he had\r\nbeen both printer and editor, and could realize the importance of such a\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nThe relationship between Sholes and Densmore was a strange meeting of\r\nopposites, the former was a dreamer and an idealist, the latter was\r\nbold, aggressive and arrogant and by some considered a plain “crank.”\r\n\r\nDensmore was not impressed with the machine more than to regard the idea\r\nas feasible, but he determined to make an attempt at selling it to some\r\nfirm with the facility and financial resources to manufacture it.\r\n\r\nDensmore paid all the debts incurred by Sholes whereby he obtained an\r\ninterest in the invention. He then engaged the services of a Mr. Yost,\r\nwith whom he had been associated in a Pennsylvania oil business, and\r\ntogether they presented the proposition to the old firm of gun makers,\r\nE. Remington & Son, of Ilion, N. Y.\r\n\r\nA tentative agreement was effected between the Remingtons and Sholes and\r\nhis new partners, and the first contract signed for the manufacture of a\r\ntypewriter for commercial use, the one built by Sholes was made in\r\nMarch, 1873.\r\n\r\nThe original contract was for the manufacture only, but in time the\r\nRemingtons acquired complete ownership.\r\n\r\nSholes, soon thereafter, sold out his royalty right to Densmore for\r\n$12,000, which was a goodly sum in those days, but was the only reward\r\nthat he ever received for his priceless invention and the years of\r\nearnest labor and expense he had bestowed upon it.\r\n\r\nDensmore did not part with his royalty rights and was subsequently\r\nenriched.\r\n\r\nFurther improvements were made on Sholes’ invention when the skilled\r\nmechanics of the Remington factory were brought into service, but the\r\nfact remains that the Montour County printer was the inventor of the\r\nalmost universally used typewriter and Densmore, another Pennsylvanian,\r\nwas the medium by which the invention was saved from the scrap heap and\r\ncommercially developed to the almost perfect machine of today. Thus\r\nPennsylvania has given to the world the typewriter.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  German Christians Organized Harmony\r\n                  Society in Butler, February 15, 1805\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Harmony Society, as it was organized by George Rapp in Wurtemberg\r\nand established in America, was an outgrowth of a Separatistic movement\r\nin Germany and an attempt to put into practice, under favorable\r\ncircumstances, Separatistic principles.\r\n\r\nThe members of the society had constituted a congregation of\r\nSeparatists, where they listened to the teachings of their pastor,\r\nGeorge Rapp. According to his instructions, they left their homes in\r\nWurtemberg and followed him to America. They settled at Harmony, Butler\r\nCounty, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nWithout election, by common consent George Rapp had maintained himself\r\nas their leader.\r\n\r\nIn order to put their society on a firm basis, and to prevent\r\nmisunderstanding, articles of association were drawn up and signed by\r\nthe members February 15, 1805. This was the date recognized as the\r\nbirthday of the society, and in after years its anniversary was\r\ncelebrated as the “Harmoniefest.”\r\n\r\nThe agreement contains five articles to which the subscribers pledged\r\nthemselves:\r\n\r\n(1) To give absolutely all their property to George Rapp and his\r\nassociates.\r\n\r\n(2) To obey the rules and regulations of the community and to work for\r\nits welfare.\r\n\r\n(3) If they desired to withdraw from the society, not to demand any\r\nreward for labor or services.\r\n\r\nIn return, George Rapp and his associates pledged themselves:\r\n\r\n(1) To supply the subscribers with all the necessities of life, both in\r\nhealth and sickness, and after death, to provide for their families.\r\n\r\n(2) In case of withdrawal to return them the value of property\r\ncontributed without interest and to give a donation in moneys to such as\r\ncontributed nothing.\r\n\r\nThe original of this agreement was in German, which was the language\r\nused by the society.\r\n\r\nGeorge Rapp was born November 1, 1757, in Iptingen, Wurtemberg, the son\r\nof Adam Rapp, a peasant. He learned the trade of weaving. Like many of\r\nhis neighbors he also engaged in wine growing.\r\n\r\nEarly in life he became deeply interested in religion. He identified\r\nhimself with the Separatists of Wurtemberg, who believed that the true\r\nChristian must live a life of self-denial and that he must suffer\r\nridicule and persecution on account of the purity of his life. They\r\nregarded the established clergy as hypocrites.\r\n\r\nThe Government interfered with their plans for living in the manner of\r\nthe early Christians with community of goods, and their religious\r\nmeetings were prohibited at the instigation of the clergy. George Rapp\r\ndecided to lead his congregation to America.\r\n\r\nIn this great undertaking, as in others of a similar nature in later\r\nyears, he displayed rare judgment in making his plans and great ability\r\nin executing them. He did not underestimate the difficulties of such an\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nHe advised his people of the hardships to be expected. He directed those\r\nwho were determined to follow him to sell their property and prepare\r\nthemselves for the journey.\r\n\r\nHe came to America in 1803, with money of his own amounting to 2000\r\ngulden, to choose a site for the proposed settlement. He left behind him\r\nin charge of his congregation a young man of high character, Frederick\r\nReickert, who in Pennsylvania was adopted by him as his son and is known\r\nin the history of the society as Frederick Rapp.\r\n\r\nGeorge Rapp landed at Baltimore and early in September, 1803, was in\r\nLancaster, Pa., considering offers of land for his settlement.\r\n\r\nAfter inspecting several tracts of land, Rapp purchased 5000 acres in\r\nButler County, on the Connoquenessing Creek, about twelve miles from the\r\nOhio River at Beaver. He then sent for his people.\r\n\r\nThey came in several companies. The ship “Aurora” brought about 300\r\npersons to Baltimore, July 4, 1804.\r\n\r\nAnother party of 260 persons, headed by Frederick Rapp, arrived on the\r\nship “Atlantic” at Philadelphia in August.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the people came in a third ship, the “Margaretta,” but\r\nthese settled in Lycoming County, under the direction of Mr. Haller, who\r\nhad assisted George Rapp in exploration for a site.\r\n\r\nThe settlers who went to the new settlement worked hard to build their\r\ntown, Harmony. They were sustained in their labors by religious\r\nenthusiasm. After a few months they were joined by their friends and on\r\nFebruary 15, 1805, the Harmony Society was formally organized.\r\n\r\nDuring the first year fifty log houses were erected, nearly 200 acres\r\ncleared and a house of worship, grist mill, barn and shops were built.\r\nThe following year 400 acres more were cleared, a saw mill, tannery,\r\ndistillery and brick store house were erected and a vineyard planted.\r\n\r\nThey raised 600 bushels of wheat more than their requirements and had\r\n3000 gallons of whisky to sell.\r\n\r\nThey soon made woolen cloth, spinning the yarn by hand. In 1809 they\r\nerected a woolen factory for manufacturing of broadcloth from the wool\r\nof merino sheep, which they were among the first to introduce in this\r\ncountry. They had their own mechanics and tradesmen.\r\n\r\nThe society was always a religious community and George Rapp, in\r\ntemporal affairs was extremely practical, but he was an enthusiast only\r\nin religion. He would not allow his authority to be questioned.\r\n\r\nWhile the settlers were prosperous, they were disappointed in their\r\nsettlement in some respects. In Germany they had raised grapes and made\r\nwine, and had hoped to engage in that industry here, but the land was\r\npoorly adapted to the culture of the vine. As their manufactures\r\nincreased their transportation troubles also increased, as they were\r\ntwelve miles distant from the Ohio River.\r\n\r\nThey accordingly decided to move, and in 1814 George Rapp, John L. Baker\r\nand Lewis Shriver explored the Western country in search of a new site\r\nfor settlement. They found a suitable place on the Wabash, in Posey\r\nCounty, Indiana, and in 1815 the whole society moved there.\r\n\r\nThey had lived in Harmony ten years, during which time 100 members had\r\ndied. They were buried in a small plot, and, as was their custom, the\r\ngraves were not marked, but only numbered.\r\n\r\nThis little graveyard, together with the substantial brick buildings of\r\nthe village, is all the memorial the Harmonists have left of their first\r\nhome in America.\r\n\r\nThe society again removed, in 1825, to Economy, Beaver County,\r\nPennsylvania, where they arrived May 17, 1825, making the trip by boat,\r\ntheir new home being located on the Ohio River twenty miles from the\r\nfirst home of the society, at Harmony, and eighteen miles from\r\nPittsburgh.\r\n\r\nGeorge Rapp died August 7, 1847, aged ninety years. The society remained\r\nintact, although reduced in membership, until May 12, 1903, when there\r\nwere but four members.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Johan Printz Arrives as Governor of New\r\n                       Sweden, February 16, 1643\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Swedes followed the Dutch in settling along the Delaware River,\r\nwhich they called the Zuydt or South River. The Swedes formed several\r\ncompanies for the purpose of trade with the New World, as America was\r\nthen called.\r\n\r\nThe first expedition came under Peter Minuit, a Hollander, in March,\r\n1638, and settled on Christiana Creek, near the present Wilmington, Del.\r\nHere they built Fort Christiana and gave the country the name New\r\nSweden. Two other expeditions came from Sweden and with them came\r\ncolonists whose names are still borne by families in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nIn 1642, Johan Printz, who had been kept busy capturing delinquent\r\nFinns, who were committing all sorts of depredations in Sweden, and\r\nrefusing to either desist or return to their own Finland, was knighted\r\nby the Swedish Government and appointed Governor of New Sweden.\r\n\r\nHe had been a lieutenant colonel of a regiment of cavalry in the Thirty\r\nYears’ War, and had been dismissed from the service because of what was\r\nheld to be a too feeble defense of a city in which he had command.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by his wife, daughter Armegot, and a minister, the Rev. John\r\nCampanius, and two vessels, the Fawn and the Swan, loaded with wine,\r\nmalt, grain, peas, nets, muskets, shoes, stockings, wearing apparel,\r\nwriting paper, sealing wax, oranges, lemons and hay, and having on board\r\na number of poachers, deserters and culprit Finns, he arrived at Fort\r\nChristiana, February 16, 1643, after a stormy voyage of five months.\r\n\r\nThis was an unusual expedition in that it was the most important of all\r\nthose sent out by Sweden and in the further fact that Printz was, next\r\nto Minuit, the most conspicuous figure connected with New Sweden.\r\n\r\nIn the instructions he received with his commission, he was to deal with\r\nthe English at Varkens Kill, near the present Salem, New Jersey, and the\r\nDutch at Fort Nassau; to treat with the Indians with humanity, protect\r\nthem, and “civilize” them—especially to sell them goods at lower prices\r\nthan the English or Dutch.\r\n\r\nHe was allowed to choose his residence at Cape Henlopen, Christiana, or\r\nJacques Island; but he was ordered to see that his fort commanded the\r\nriver, and that a good winter harbor for vessels was close at hand.\r\n\r\nPrintz lost no time in carrying out his instructions. Proceeding up the\r\nriver from Christiana, he decided to make the seat of government at\r\nJacques Island, the place called by the Indians Tenacong and since\r\nTinicum. Here he built a fort of green logs, mounted on it four brass\r\ncannon, and called it Nye (New) Gottenburg.\r\n\r\nThus Printz made the first settlement by white men in what is now\r\nPennsylvania which was destined to survive. Kling was sent to make a\r\nsettlement on the Schuylkill, and he built a fort near its mouth, called\r\nNew Korsholm.\r\n\r\nPrintz, however, was not content with the forts already erected, but a\r\nthird was built, in 1643, on the east side of the river below Mill\r\nCreek, called Fort Elfborg, which was mounted with eight cannon and a\r\nmortar, and garrisoned with thirteen soldiers, under Swen Skute. The\r\nstory is that later the men were driven out by mosquitoes. This fort was\r\nintended to shut up the river, a matter which greatly exasperated the\r\nDutch, whose ships, when passing, had to lower their colors and were\r\nboarded by the Swedes.\r\n\r\nIn 1645 these Swedes started what was undoubtedly the first industrial\r\nplant in Pennsylvania. That was a small grist mill, which they built on\r\nthe waters of Cobbs Creek, and when its wheels began to turn the\r\nindustry of the greatest industrial State in the world began its\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nAt Tinicum the Swedish settlements now centered. In three or four years\r\nfollowing Printz’s arrival, Tinicum gradually assumed the character of a\r\nhamlet.\r\n\r\nIn 1645, he built a mansion on Tinicum Island, and it long bore the name\r\nof Printzhof.\r\n\r\nA church was also built at this time, which the Reverend Mr. Campanius\r\ndedicated September 4, 1646. This was the first house of Christian\r\nworship within the present limits of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nIndian troubles threatened during 1644. The shocking and unpardonable\r\ncruelties of Kieft, the Governor of Manhattan, in which hundreds of\r\nIndians, along the Hudson, were slain, caused the belief among the\r\nnatives that the newcomers were cruel.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1644, two white soldiers and a laborer were killed on\r\nthe Delaware, below Christiana, and later a Swedish woman and her\r\nEnglish husband were killed between Tinicum and Upland. This event was\r\nthe first tragedy in which white blood was shed in Pennsylvania by the\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nPrintz assembled his people for defense at Upland, but the Indian chiefs\r\nof the region came in, disowned the act, and effected a treaty.\r\n\r\nThere was a long period during which no ships from Sweden came, and the\r\ncolonists were destitute for necessities which they depended on\r\nreceiving from the homeland. There was no vessel from March, 1644, until\r\nthe “Golden Shark” arrived October 1, 1646.\r\n\r\nThe settlement of the country, however, proceeded very slowly under\r\nSwedish enterprise, while trade was pushed to an extent never before\r\nknown upon the river. This greatly annoyed the Dutch, and in consequence\r\nof having lost this trade to the Swedes, the Dutch Governor, Kieft, sent\r\nHudde to keep watch on the proceedings of Governor Printz and to resist\r\nhis supposed innovation. These two soon got into angry controversy, but\r\nthrough the negotiation of the Reverend Mr. Campanius, an amicable\r\narrangement was entered into regarding the trade of the Schuylkill.\r\n\r\nBut the real object of the Dutch was to plant a settlement on the\r\nwestern shore of the Delaware, and to this Governor Printz entered a\r\nsharp protest.\r\n\r\nGovernor Kieft was recalled about this time, and he was succeeded by\r\nPeter Stuyvesant, whose Administration commenced May 27, 1647, and\r\ncontinued until 1664, when the American interests of the Dutch passed\r\ninto the hands of the English.\r\n\r\nThe disagreement between the Dutch and Swedes continued, giving rise to\r\nmutual hatred and jealousy. The Dutch “arms” were set up on the west\r\nbank and as promptly taken down by the Swedes.\r\n\r\nPrintz had requested to be relieved, but he was ordered to remain when\r\nnew grants of land were made to him, and he remained at his post until\r\nOctober, 1653, when he transferred the charge of the Government to his\r\nson-in-law, John Papegoja, and sailed for Sweden.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Captain William Trent Leads First English\r\n                     Armed Force to Forks of Ohio,\r\n                           February 17, 1754\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevious to the French and Indian War, and in fact until the Revolution,\r\nVirginia held that the upper Ohio Valley, in what is now Pennsylvania,\r\nwas a part of their Dominion.\r\n\r\nGovernor Dinwiddie feared the aggressions of the French in that region\r\nand commenced preparations for raising a force to be sent to the “Forks\r\nof the Ohio” (Pittsburgh), to occupy that strategic point, and build a\r\ndefensive work that would enable him to resist the French.\r\n\r\nThis force, a company of Colonial Militiamen under command of Captain\r\nWilliam Trent, marched from Virginia, in January, 1754, and reached the\r\nForks February 17, following.\r\n\r\nWork was begun, but proceeded slowly on account of the severity of the\r\nweather, and Captain Trent returning to Will’s Creek, left in charge a\r\nyoung commissioned officer, an ensign, named Edward Ward.\r\n\r\nThis was not, however, the first aggressive action on the part of\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania authorities believed that the limits of the State were\r\nabout what they are today, but they had so many internal jealousies and\r\nquarrels on their hands at the time the French became active intruders\r\nalong the French Creek, Allegheny and Ohio Rivers, that they delayed\r\nmaking any action against them.\r\n\r\nWhile Virginia was experiencing almost similar difficulties as\r\nPennsylvania, she did, in 1753, take steps to put a stop to the farther\r\nadvance of the French.\r\n\r\nGovernor Dinwiddie dispatched Captain William Trent to ascertain the\r\nactivities of the French, but he neglected his duty, and went no farther\r\nthan Logstown. In a letter to the Lords of Trade, Dinwiddie said of\r\nthem: “He reports the French were then one hundred and fifty miles up\r\nthe river, and, I believe, was afraid to go to them.”\r\n\r\nThe home government advised Dinwiddie to obtain information and for this\r\npurpose to dispatch a messenger. Acting under these instructions,\r\nDinwiddie sent a young man who was destined to become finally the most\r\nillustrious figure in American history. This was George Washington.\r\n\r\nFollowing out his instructions, young Washington proceeded to Logstown,\r\nand thence with Tanacharison or the Half-King, Jeskakake, White Thunder,\r\nand Guyasutha or the Hunter, he set out November 30, and on December 11,\r\nreached Fort Le Boeuf, which was on the site of the present Waterford,\r\nErie County, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nHaving accomplished the purpose of his mission, and obtained full\r\ninformation of the strength and plans of the French, and an answer to\r\nthe letter which he had carried from Governor Dinwiddie to the French\r\ncommandant, he returned with much hardship to Virginia, reaching\r\nWilliamsburg, January 16, 1754, where he made his report to the\r\nGovernor.\r\n\r\nThis information led at once to military measures for the defense of the\r\nOhio, and the command of Captain Trent pushed forward.\r\n\r\nThe French were promptly warned of the arrival of Trent’s troops, and\r\nwere not long idle.\r\n\r\nOn April 17, when the fort was still uncompleted, Ensign Ward suddenly\r\nfound himself surrounded by a force of one thousand men, French and\r\nIndians, under the command of Captain Contrecoeur, with eighteen pieces\r\nof artillery.\r\n\r\nBy Chevalier Le Mercier, captain of the artillery of Canada, Contrecoeur\r\nsent a summons to the commanding officer of the English to surrender,\r\ninforming him that he, Contrecoeur, “was come out into this place,\r\ncharged with orders from his General to request him (the English\r\ncommander) to retreat peaceably, with his troops from off the lands of\r\nthe French king, and not to return, or else he would find himself\r\nobliged to fulfill his duty, and compel him to it.” “I hope,” continued\r\nContrecoeur, in his summons, “that you will not defer one instant, and\r\nthat you will not force me to the last extremity. In that case, sir, you\r\nmay be persuaded that I will give orders that there shall be no damage\r\ndone by my detachment.”\r\n\r\nThe friendly Half King, who was present, advised Ward to reply that he\r\nwas not an officer of rank with power to answer the demand, and to\r\nrequest delay until he could send for his superior officer.\r\n\r\nContrecoeur refused to parley, and demanded immediate surrender.\r\n\r\nHaving less than forty men in a half finished stockade, Ward was unable\r\nto resist the force opposed to him, and therefore prudently yielded to\r\nthe demand without further hesitation.\r\n\r\nHe was allowed to withdraw his men and take his tools with him, and on\r\nthe morning of April 18, he left the position and started on his return\r\nto Virginia.\r\n\r\nThis affair was one of the initial events of the French and Indian War,\r\nan epoch-making struggle.\r\n\r\nThe French took possession of the half-finished fort and completed it,\r\nnaming it Fort Duquesne, in honor of Marquis Du Quesne, then Governor\r\nGeneral of Canada.\r\n\r\nCaptain William Trent who led the first English armed force into the\r\nOhio Valley, February 17, 1754, was a native of Chester County,\r\nPennsylvania. His name is given to Trenton, N. J.\r\n\r\nIn 1746, Governor Thomas appointed him captain of one of the four\r\ncompanies raised in Pennsylvania, for an intended expedition against\r\nCanada. In 1749, Governor Hamilton appointed him a justice for\r\nCumberland County, where in the following year he formed a partnership\r\nwith George Croghan to engage in the Indian trade, and he went to\r\nLogstown.\r\n\r\nIn 1753, the Governor of Virginia directed him to build a fort at the\r\n“Forks of the Ohio,” which seems to be the first time he recognized the\r\nauthority of Virginia.\r\n\r\nCaptain Trent again entered the service of Pennsylvania, in 1755, as a\r\nmember of the Council, but two years later he again entered the employ\r\nof Virginia.\r\n\r\nIn 1763, his large trading house near Fort Pitt was destroyed by the\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nDuring the Revolution Congress gave him a commission as major.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               William Rittenhouse, Who Built First Paper\r\n\r\nMill in America, Died February 18,1708\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first paper mill on the American continent was established in 1690\r\nby the Reverend William Rittenhouse, upon a branch of Wissahickon Creek,\r\nand from that date until 1710 there was no other paper mill in the\r\nAmerican Colonies.\r\n\r\nThis mill was situated on a meadow along the bank of a stream known as\r\nPaper-Mill Run, which empties into the Wissahickon Creek, about two\r\nmiles above its confluence with the Schuylkill.\r\n\r\nThe founder emigrated from Holland, where he was born in the\r\nPrincipality of Broich, in the year 1644. He spelled his name then\r\nRyttinhuisen, which is anglicized into Rittenhouse.\r\n\r\nHis ancestors had been engaged for generations in paper-making, and he\r\nhad learned the same business. It has been stated that he had a brother\r\nwho originally came to New York while it was a Dutch Colony; that the\r\nbrother settled in New Jersey, but William, with his two sons, Claus or\r\nNicholas, and Garrett or Gerhard, came to Pennsylvania prior to or\r\nduring the year 1690. The Rittenhouses were among “sixty-four of the\r\nfirst Germantown inhabitants,” as they were styled, who were granted\r\nnaturalization by Thomas Lloyd, Deputy Governor, on May 7, 1691.\r\n\r\nAt the time Rittenhouse arrived in Germantown there was a printer,\r\nWilliam Bradford, already established in an office in Philadelphia, and\r\nit may be that he induced the paper-makers to locate there. Anyway they\r\nno sooner settled at Germantown than they began the erection of a paper\r\nmill, on property purchased from Samuel Carpenter, of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the original deed that William Bradford, Robert Turner\r\nand Thomas Tresse were interested with William Rittenhouse in the\r\nenterprise. They were deeded twenty acres.\r\n\r\nThe mill was built, but soon thereafter Robert Turner died, and Bradford\r\nand Tresse assigned their rights to William Rittenhouse, who became the\r\nsole owner. Their deed for this property was acknowledged December 6,\r\n1693. The term of the lease was for 975 years from the 29th of\r\nSeptember, 1705, and the rent reserved was five shillings sterling per\r\nannum.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that there was at first a company regularly organized to\r\nestablish a paper mill. Samuel Carpenter and Robert Turner were\r\nextensive land owners and were advisers and coadjutors of William Penn.\r\nThomas Tresse was a rich iron monger and William Bradford was the famous\r\nprinter who established the first printing press in the middle colonies\r\nof America, in 1685.\r\n\r\nThe chief and most important member of this company was William\r\nRittenhouse, who became the sole proprietor prior to 1705, unless the\r\ninterest of Tresse was purchased by Claus Rittenhouse, about 1701. It\r\nalso seems that the son bought Bradford’s interest in 1704. Father and\r\nson were practical papermakers and the owners.\r\n\r\nBradford got himself into trouble when he printed the charter without\r\nleave of the ruling powers, and then for printing a pamphlet of George\r\nKeith, a seceding Scotch Quaker. He was arraigned in court, and in 1693\r\nleft Philadelphia and established himself in New York, where he\r\nintroduced the first printing plant in that province.\r\n\r\nWhen Bradford left Philadelphia he was to receive for his share of the\r\nmill paper of the value of six pounds, two shillings, and the assurance\r\nthat he had a monopoly of the entire printing paper that was made in\r\nAmerica from September 1, 1697, until September 1, 1707. The quantity is\r\nnot stated, neither is there anything by which we can determine, at this\r\nlate day, the capacity of the mill.\r\n\r\nAll paper was then manufactured by hand, each sheet being made\r\nseparately. At that early day and long afterward the rags were pounded\r\ninto pulp in stone and iron mortars by the aid of trip-hammers, and\r\nseveral days were required to furnish a sample sheet of dry-finished\r\npaper. At that time a day’s production per man was one and a half reams\r\nof newspaper of the size of 20 by 30 inches. Small as was this mill, its\r\nimportance can hardly be understood, for the greatest commercial\r\nmetropolis of America drew its supply of printing paper from this mill.\r\n\r\nThere, in this secluded spot, away from any except the hermits who lived\r\nin the caves along the Wissahickon, and with no access to Philadelphia\r\nexcept by Germantown, William Rittenhouse, and his son devoted\r\nthemselves with untiring industry to their useful and honorable art.\r\nThey soon acquired a wide reputation as producers of “good paper,” and\r\nto this they usually affixed a water-mark.\r\n\r\nIn 1701 a great misfortune overtook the honest craftsmen. The little\r\nstream on which they depended for their water-power experienced a\r\nfreshet of such fury that the mill was swept away and entirely\r\ndestroyed, and all machinery, stock, tools and much personal property\r\ncarried away in the flood.\r\n\r\nNothing daunted they resolved to begin anew. They chose another site a\r\nshort distance below the first mill and in 1702 a mill, better than the\r\noriginal, was erected.\r\n\r\nIn the new mill Bradford still retained an interest but Claus\r\nRittenhouse would not renew his monopoly on the mill’s supply. On June\r\n30, 1704, Bradford sold his share in the mill, and from that day the\r\npaper mill became a Rittenhouse concern and so continued for\r\ngenerations, until the mill had been rebuilt a fourth time, when it was\r\nconverted into a cotton factory.\r\n\r\nWilliam Rittenhouse died February 18, 1708, and was succeeded in the\r\nbusiness by his son, Claus. Both father and son were also Mennonite\r\npreachers.\r\n\r\nClaus continued to supply not only Bradford in New York, but the home\r\nmarket in Germantown and Philadelphia. Bradford paid partly in fine rags\r\nfor his paper.\r\n\r\nA second paper mill was erected in 1710, in Germantown, by William De\r\nWees, a brother-in-law of Claus Rittenhouse, under whom he learned the\r\ntrade of papermaking. Claus Rittenhouse obtained possession of this mill\r\nin 1713, and it was operated for many years.\r\n\r\nWhen Andrew Bradford established The American Mercury, in Philadelphia,\r\nDecember 22, 1719, the first newspaper ever printed in the British\r\nMiddle Colonies, the paper for his Mercury was made at the Rittenhouse\r\nmill.\r\n\r\nClaus Rittenhouse, the second papermaker in America, died in May, 1734,\r\naged sixty-eight. He was born in Holland, June 15, 1666. He was the\r\ngrandfather of David Rittenhouse, the American astronomer, who was also\r\ntreasurer of Pennsylvania during the Revolution.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Canal System Started with Committee Report\r\n                          of February 19, 1791\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the earliest days, before railroads and steam power were developed,\r\nwater communication was the popular mode of commercial transportation.\r\nThe spirit of the early settlers in Pennsylvania was alive with the idea\r\nof internal improvement, and very early they were anxious to reach out\r\ntoward the western empire that was to become the promised land and\r\nfurnish food for the world. The ultimate result of this vision was the\r\nconstruction of the grand system of canals connecting the navigable\r\nrivers, Delaware and Ohio, by which products of the States and\r\nTerritories to the westward could be carried to Philadelphia, the\r\nmetropolitan seaport city of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nWilliam Penn fostered the idea and recommended a scheme to connect the\r\nSusquehanna at what is now Middletown with Philadelphia by uniting the\r\nwaters of the Schuylkill River at Reading with those of Tulpehocken\r\nCreek and the Quittapahilla, which flowed into the Swatara ten miles\r\nwestward and thence into the Susquehanna at Middletown.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1761 Commissioners were appointed by the Proprietaries to\r\nclear, scour and make the Schuylkill navigable for boats, flats, rafts,\r\ncanoes and other small vessels, from the ridge of mountains commonly\r\ncalled the Blue Mountains to the river Delaware. This action was the\r\ninitial step in the formation of the Schuylkill Navigation Company.\r\n\r\nThe broad river itself in many portions was concentrated into pools\r\nforming slack water navigation and these pools were connected by\r\nsections of canals with a depth of six feet of water, passing boats with\r\na capacity of 200 tons.\r\n\r\nThe committee appointed in January, 1791, to examine the report of the\r\nCommissioners who explored the Delaware and western waters of the\r\nSusquehanna, reported February 19. They considered the Delaware toward\r\nNew York State and to Lake Ontario; the Lehigh and Schuylkill, the\r\nlatter with the object of reaching Harrisburg; the Juniata and the north\r\nand west branches of the Susquehanna.\r\n\r\nThe several principal canals of the State in the order of the dates in\r\nwhich they were created by acts of Assembly, and from which all others\r\nwere either extensions or feeders, were as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Schuylkill and Susquehanna Navigation Company, created September 29,\r\n1791, passed through the counties of Dauphin, Lebanon and Berks. It\r\nbegan at Columbia on the Susquehanna and extended to the mouth of the\r\nJuniata, then later on up along that river to Hollidaysburg at the\r\neastern base of the Allegheny Mountains—a total length of 171 miles.\r\n\r\n2. Delaware and Schuylkill, April 10, 1792, in Berks, Montgomery and\r\nPhiladelphia Counties.\r\n\r\n3. Conewago Canal in York County, April 10, 1793.\r\n\r\n4. Brandywine Canal and Lock Navigation, April 10, 1793.\r\n\r\n5. Lehigh Navigation, February 27, 1798, in Northampton and Luzerne\r\nCounties. A total of forty-six miles.\r\n\r\n6. Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, February 19, 1801.\r\n\r\n7. Concocheague Navigation, February 7, 1803; connected Chambersburg\r\nwith the Potomac.\r\n\r\n8. Conestoga Lock and Dam Navigation, March 17, 1806, in Lancaster\r\nCounty, was an improvement of Conestoga Creek by locks and dams from its\r\nmouth to the city of Lancaster, a distance of fourteen miles.\r\n\r\n9. Union Canal Company, April 2, 1811, connected the Susquehanna at\r\nMiddletown to the Schuylkill two miles below Reading; length eighty-two\r\nmiles. There was also a branch canal and feeder twenty-two miles in\r\nlength with a railroad of four miles to Pine Grove coal mines.\r\n\r\n10. Neshaminy Lock Navigation, March 26, 1814.\r\n\r\n11. Schuylkill Navigation, March 8, 1815, in Schuylkill, Berks,\r\nMontgomery, Chester and Philadelphia Counties. This began at Port Carbon\r\non Schuylkill, and ran to Philadelphia, a distance of 108 miles.\r\n\r\n12. Lackawanna Navigation, February 5, 1817, a part of the Delaware and\r\nHudson Canal, from Honesdale on the Lackawaxen to the mouth of that\r\nstream, a distance of twenty miles.\r\n\r\n13. Monongahela Navigation, March 24, 1817, in Fayette, Greene,\r\nWestmoreland, Washington and Allegheny Counties. From Johnstown on the\r\nConemaugh, at the western base of the Allegheny down the Conemaugh,\r\nKiskiminetas and Allegheny to Pittsburgh—distance, 105 miles.\r\n\r\n14. Octoraro Navigation, March 29, 1819.\r\n\r\n15. Conewago Canal, east side, March 29, 1814.\r\n\r\nIn the report of Canal Commissioners made in 1827 was this paragraph:\r\n\r\n“In the latter end of May the location of a line from the mouth of the\r\nJuniata to Northumberland was commenced, beginning at Duncan Island, and\r\nextending up the west side to a point opposite Northumberland.” This\r\ncanal was thirty-seven miles in length.\r\n\r\nThe North Branch began at Northumberland and extended to two miles below\r\nWilkes-Barre, and later extended to New York State line.\r\n\r\nThe West Branch began at Northumberland and ran to Muncy Dam, a distance\r\nof twenty-six miles, but later was extended to Bald Eagle, where it\r\nunited with the Erie Canal.\r\n\r\nAfter extensive surveys made in 1824 and 1825, the Commonwealth entered,\r\nin the year 1826, into the actual construction of an extended system of\r\ninternal improvements and continued the annual expenditure of large sums\r\nof money for canals and railroads for fifteen years, or until 1841.\r\n\r\nGround was broken at Harrisburg for the building of the Pennsylvania\r\nCanal, on July 4, 1826. By the year 1834 a total of 673 miles of public\r\nworks had been completed, at a time when the credit of the State was\r\ngood. But unfortunately too extensive a system was undertaken and the\r\nworks were not constructed or managed with economy. The debt of 1834 had\r\nmounted to twenty-three millions. By 1841 it reached forty-two millions,\r\nand the State defaulted even the interest on these bonds and all work\r\nceased.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              French and Indian War Started by Arrival of\r\n\r\nBraddock’s Troops February 20, 1755\r\n\r\n\r\nThe French and Indian War opened April 17, 1754, when Ensign Ward was\r\nsurprised by the appearance of a large French force, under Contrecoeur,\r\nwhile he was engaged in completing a stockade at the forks of the Ohio.\r\nThe Ensign was obliged to surrender his position to the superior forces\r\nand retreat.\r\n\r\nGovernor Hamilton strongly urged the Pennsylvania Assembly to organize\r\nthe militia and aid the Virginians, but they questioned the right of\r\nGovernor Dinwiddie of Virginia to invade the Province of Pennsylvania\r\nand charged his action as impudent.\r\n\r\nVirginia raised a force of 300 men, under command of Colonel Fry and\r\nLieutenant Colonel George Washington, and near the Great Meadows, in\r\nPennsylvania, a detachment of the French forces, under Jumonville, which\r\nhad been sent to intercept the Virginians, was defeated and Jumonville\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\nColonel Washington erected Fort Necessity near this point, and upon the\r\ndeath of Colonel Fry was promoted to the command.\r\n\r\nWashington led the small column against Fort Duquesne, but a large\r\nFrench force compelled the Virginians to fall back upon their stockade.\r\nThe French, under M. de Villier, attacked them and, after a desperate\r\ndefense, Washington was obliged to capitulate.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1754, Governor Hamilton was succeeded by Robert Hunter\r\nMorris, who assumed his duties at the same time that a new Assembly was\r\nelected. At the session in December the Governor laid before it the\r\nroyal order for a concert of action with the other colonies, commanding\r\nthem to act vigorously in defense of their own province and to aid the\r\nother colonies to repel every hostile invasion.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly appropriated £40,000 of which £20,000 was for the King’s\r\nuse, redeemable by the excise in twelve years, the balance to supplant\r\nthe torn and defaced bills of former issues.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain determined to oppose the growing power of France in\r\nAmerica, and ordered two regiments of foot from Ireland, under command\r\nof Colonels Dunbar and Halkett, to Virginia, to be there reinforced;\r\nother troops were ordered to be raised in America, 2000 in New England,\r\n3000 in Pennsylvania, which were to be placed at the disposal of a\r\ncommander-in-chief, who would be sent over for that purpose.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania was, in addition, required to supply the foreign troops on\r\ntheir arrival with provisions and all necessaries for the soldiers\r\nlanded or raised in the Province; also to provide the officers with\r\nmeans for traveling; and to impress carriages and quarter troops. All\r\nthe expense of this program was to be borne by the Province; whilst\r\narticles of more general concern would be charged upon a common fund to\r\nbe raised from all the colonies of North America, of which the Province\r\nof Pennsylvania would be required to bear its proportionate share. The\r\nGovernor of Pennsylvania was also directed to urge the Assembly to\r\ncontribute liberally, until a union of the northern colonies for general\r\ndefense could be effected. At this late day it would appear that the\r\nmother country depended more on Pennsylvania and Virginia than on all\r\nher other possessions in North America; and more on Pennsylvania than on\r\nVirginia for men and provisions.\r\n\r\nGovernor Morris and the Assembly fenced for position on the proposition\r\nof a grant of an enormous sum for the King’s use. Neither side would\r\nyield. Finally the Assembly borrowed, on the credit of the House, £5000,\r\nto be expended in the purchase of fresh provisions, for the use of the\r\nKing’s troops on their arrival, and appointed a committee to negotiate\r\nthe loan. This action was unquestionably arrived at in an effort to\r\nprove to the Crown that their disposition was to assist the mother\r\ngovernment, if treated by the Proprietary as they had a right to expect.\r\n\r\nOn January 14, 1755, Major General Edward Braddock, Sir John St. Clair,\r\nAdjutant General, and the regiments of Colonels Dunbar and Halkett\r\nsailed from Cork. They arrived at Alexandria, Va., February 20, whence\r\nthey marched to Fredericktown, Md.\r\n\r\nThe place of debarkation was selected with that ignorance and want of\r\njudgment which distinguished the British Ministry. Neither the country\r\nof Maryland nor Virginia could furnish provisions or carriages for the\r\narmy, while Pennsylvania, rich in grain and well stocked with wagons and\r\nstock, could readily supply food and the means of transportation\r\nrequired by officers and men in moving an army to any point.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly could hardly feel otherwise at such a move, than that\r\neither the British ministry or Major-General Braddock was prejudiced\r\nagainst the government of this Province, so Dr. Franklin was sent to\r\nGeneral Braddock, to undeceive him.\r\n\r\nWhile Franklin was yet with the army the return of the wagons obtainable\r\nwas made to the general, from which it appeared that there were not more\r\nthan twenty-five, and not all these serviceable.\r\n\r\nBraddock was so thoroughly disgusted with this condition of affairs that\r\nhe declared the expedition at an end and exclaimed against the Ministers\r\nwho would send him into a country destitute of the means of\r\ntransportation. Franklin expressed his regret that the army had not been\r\nlanded in Pennsylvania, where such means abounded. Braddock seized his\r\nwords and at once commissioned him on liberal terms to procure 150\r\nwagons and 1500 pack horses.\r\n\r\nFranklin immediately returned to Philadelphia and circulated\r\nadvertisements through the counties of Lancaster, York and Cumberland,\r\nand by a clever address obtained in two weeks all the wagons, 250 pack\r\nhorses and much popularity for himself.\r\n\r\nFranklin stated in his address that he found General Braddock incensed\r\nat the delay of the horses and carriages he had expected from\r\nPhiladelphia, and was disposed to send an armed force to seize\r\ncarriages, horses and drivers necessary to the service. But that he,\r\napprehending the visit of British soldiers in their present temper would\r\nbe very inconvenient to the inhabitants and that he was desirous to try\r\nwhat might be done by fair and equitable means; and that now an\r\nopportunity was presented of obtaining £30,000 in silver and gold, which\r\nwould supply the deficiency of the Provincial currency. He expended £800\r\nreceived from the general, advanced £200 from his own purse and gave his\r\npersonal bond for the payment of the value of such horses as should be\r\nlost in the service. The claims made upon him in consequence of this\r\nengagement amounted to £20,000, and were not settled by the Government\r\nuntil after much trouble and delay.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               State Capital Removed to Harrisburg by Act\r\n\r\nof February 21, 1810\r\n\r\n\r\nVery soon after the close of the Revolution there began an agitation\r\nabout the removal of the seat of the State Government from Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1787, the Assembly, then a single branch, resolved that\r\nPhiladelphia was “an unfortunate location” and expressed by their votes\r\nits determination to build a State house at Harrisburg on a plot of\r\nground the property of the Commonwealth, etc., being four and a half\r\nacres, conveyed by John Harris in 1785. Harrisburg was then a town of\r\nnearly 600 inhabitants.\r\n\r\nAction was not taken, but again in subsequent sessions, as in 1795, the\r\nHouse voted thirty-six to thirty-four in favor of moving the seat of\r\nGovernment to Carlisle. The Senate did not concur.\r\n\r\nIn 1798 the House agreed to remove to Wrightsville, York County,\r\n“without delay.” Again the Senate refused to concur.\r\n\r\nBut in 1799 the effort in favor of removal was crowned with success.\r\nBoth branches voted this time to remove to Lancaster, then a town of\r\ngreat importance, by far the most considerable in the interior.\r\nAccordingly, in December, 1799, the Legislature met in Lancaster,\r\ncontinuing to do so until the spring of 1812, when the seat of\r\nGovernment was removed to its present location in Harrisburg.\r\n\r\nThe provisions of the Constitution now require that no removal can\r\nhereafter be made without the consent of the people at a general\r\nelection, and, although there have been many attempts made to relocate\r\nat Philadelphia and elsewhere since 1812, it is hardly probable that any\r\nother city or section will ever be acceptable to the citizens.\r\n\r\nIt appears the choice of Lancaster was not as satisfactory as expected\r\nas agitation for another removal was almost immediately commenced. On\r\nDecember 9, 1801, a motion was made by Stacy Potts, of Dauphin County,\r\nseconded by Mr. Lord Butler, of Luzerne County, calling for the\r\nappointment of a committee to consider and report on “the most eligible\r\nplace to fix the permanent seat of government of this State.” The House\r\nvoted to consider the report, January 13, 1802, but nothing further was\r\ndone during that session, except an attempt to introduce the measure\r\nunder a fresh dress. A measure was introduced for the erection of a\r\nstructure for the “safe preservation” of the State papers. Under this\r\nthin disguise, the subject of removal was very skillfully avoided by\r\nthose opposed to removal in a debate extending through December, 1802,\r\nand ending latter part of the following January.\r\n\r\nSenator Laird, January 4, 1809, presented the petition of sundry\r\ninhabitants of the town of Northumberland, at the forks of the\r\nSusquehanna, setting forth the central situation of that growing town,\r\nand showing the advantages of fixing the State government there,\r\noffering accommodations for the officers of the State and members of the\r\nLegislature, and praying a removal of the seat of government thither.\r\n\r\nThis petition was referred to a committee consisting of Senators Laird,\r\nHeston, Doty, Hiester and Laycock.\r\n\r\nThe committee shortly after submitted a report recommending the removal\r\nof the seat of government to the town of Northumberland. The Senate,\r\nhowever, when the report was under consideration, struck out the word\r\n“Northumberland,” and from that moment onward the subject was constantly\r\nagitated.\r\n\r\nOn February 17, 1809, the Senate, in Committee of the Whole, endeavored\r\nto have the words “City of Philadelphia,” inserted as the place for the\r\nseat of government, but, on vote, the motion was lost when only eight\r\nSenators supported the motion. Then another effort to insert the name of\r\nNorthumberland was made, also Middletown, and Harrisburg. Northumberland\r\nreceived only seven votes, but when Harrisburg was voted upon the Senate\r\nsupported it by a vote of fourteen to ten, but the House refused to\r\nconsider the bill during that session. No further action was taken until\r\nFebruary, 1810, when a bill passed both branches of the Legislature and\r\nbecame a law, February 21, 1810.\r\n\r\nThis act consisted of ten sections and provided “that within the month\r\nof October, 1812, all the offices attached to the seat of government of\r\nthis State shall be removed to the Borough of Harrisburg,” etc.\r\n\r\nRobert Harris, George Hoyer and George Ziegler were named in the act as\r\ncommissioners to superintend and direct the removal of books, records,\r\npapers and other documents, etc., and to provide good and suitable rooms\r\nand apartments for the accommodation of the Legislature and the State\r\ndepartments.\r\n\r\nThe Governor was directed to accept “on behalf and in the name of the\r\nCommonwealth the offer of ten acres of land in or adjoining the said\r\nBorough of Harrisburg, at $100 per acre, made by William Maclay,\r\nadjoining to the four-acre lot formerly appropriated by John Harris for\r\nthe use of the State,” etc.\r\n\r\nAppropriations were made for the payment of this land and for the\r\nerection of office buildings. The Governor was authorized to appoint\r\nthree commissioners to fix upon a site, procure plans for and\r\nsuperintend the erection of the buildings.\r\n\r\nGovernor Simon Snyder appointed William Findlay, Richard M. Crain,\r\nGeorge Bryan, John B. Gibson and William Gibbons as commissioners and\r\nthey selected Stephen Mills as architect.\r\n\r\nA supplement to the act passed February 7, 1812, provided that all the\r\noffices should be removed to Harrisburg during the month of April. A\r\nsecond supplement passed March 10, 1812, directed “the clerks of the two\r\nhouses, on or before the 1st of June next (1812), to remove or cause to\r\nbe removed all the papers, records, books and documents belonging to\r\neach house aforesaid, together with whatever furniture may be thought\r\nfit for removal.”\r\n\r\nFrom these records it is ascertained that the Government of the State\r\nwas removed in all its departments, in the year 1812, from Lancaster to\r\nHarrisburg, and that the first organization at the latter place was in\r\nDecember of that year.\r\n\r\nThe first sessions of the Legislature were held in the old court house.\r\n\r\nThe cornerstone of the capitol was laid Monday, May 31, 1819, by\r\nGovernor William Findlay. The construction was rapidly pushed forward,\r\nand the building made ready for occupancy in December, 1821.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature met in the new capitol, Wednesday, January 2, 1822, when\r\nproper ceremonies were held in honor of the event. This building was\r\ndestroyed by fire February 2, 1897.\r\n\r\nThe present magnificent capitol building was constructed by a Commission\r\ncomposed of Governor William A. Stone, Edward Bailey, William P. Snyder,\r\nNathan C. Schaeffer and William H. Graham. Other officers of the\r\ncommission were T. L. Erye, superintendent; Robert K. Young, general\r\ncounsel; Edgar C. Gerwig, secretary; Joseph M. Huston, architect, and\r\nGeorge F. Payne, contractor.\r\n\r\nThe capitol was dedicated, October 4, 1906, when President Roosevelt\r\ndelivered the oration, and was entertained at luncheon by Governor\r\nPennypacker.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Service and Captivity of Captain John Boyd,\r\n                         Born February 22, 1750\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the distinguished patriots of the Continental Army during the\r\nRevolution was Captain John Boyd, a frontiersman, who suffered Indian\r\ncaptivity and lived to rejoin his family and again become one of the\r\nforemost citizens of his time.\r\n\r\nThe Boyd family gained a foothold in America when John Boyd, the\r\nemigrant from the North of Ireland, landed on these shores in 1744, and\r\nsettled in Chester County. He married Sarah De Vane, and they removed to\r\nNorthumberland County, where they continued to reside until their\r\ndecease. They were the parents of three patriotic sons—John, born\r\nFebruary 22, 1750; Thomas, born in 1752, and William, born in 1755.\r\n\r\nWilliam Boyd was a lieutenant in the Twelfth Regiment of the Continental\r\nLine, under Colonel William Cooke. He fell at the Battle of Brandywine.\r\n\r\nThomas Boyd was a lieutenant in General John Sullivan’s command when he\r\nmade his successful campaign against the Six Nations in Northern\r\nPennsylvania and Southern New York in 1779. Lieutenant Boyd was in\r\ncharge of a scouting detail on the march when he was captured by the\r\nIndians and Tories under command of Colonel John Butler, near Little\r\nBeard’s Town, in the Genesee.\r\n\r\nBoyd was surrounded by a strong detachment of the enemy, who killed\r\nfourteen of his men. He and a soldier were captured and only eight\r\nescaped. When General Sullivan learned of Boyd’s fate the advance was\r\nquickened in the hope they could reach him, but on arriving at Genesee\r\nCastle his remains and those of the other prisoners were found,\r\nsurrounded by all the horrid evidences of savage barbarity. The torture\r\nfires were yet burning. Flaming pine knots had been thrust into their\r\nflesh, their fingernails pulled out, their tongues cut off and their\r\nheads severed from their bodies.\r\n\r\nJohn, the eldest brother, was commissioned as a first lieutenant in the\r\nContinental Army in May, 1777, which rank he held until February, 1781,\r\nwhen he received a captain’s commission from the State of Pennsylvania,\r\nwhich had resolved to raise and equip three companies of Rangers for the\r\ndefense of the western frontier, then sorely distressed by the hostile\r\nincursions of the savages. It was to the command of one of these\r\ncompanies, that Captain John Boyd was promoted.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1781, while marching his men across the Allegheny Mountains, he\r\nfell into an ambuscade of Indians near the headwaters of the Raystown\r\nbranch of the Juniata River, in Bedford County, and was made a prisoner\r\nwith a number of his soldiers, and led captive through the wilderness to\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nCaptain Boyd was confined during his imprisonment in Canada on an island\r\nin the St. Lawrence, near Montreal.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1782 an exchange of prisoners took place and he was\r\nreturned to Philadelphia with a number of his fellow soldiers.\r\n\r\nPrevious to his capture he had been engaged in the Battles of White\r\nPlains, Germantown, Brandywine and Stony Point. He was one of the fifty\r\nwho composed the “forlorn hope,” led by Mad Anthony Wayne at Stony\r\nPoint, who met within the fort. He was at West Point and witnessed the\r\nexecution of the unfortunate Major Andre.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the ambuscade Captain Boyd was wounded during the\r\nskirmish, but after his capture and in spite of his wounds, he made a\r\ndesperate effort to escape by running, but was pursued and received\r\nthree terrible gashes in his head with a tomahawk when he was\r\nre-captured.\r\n\r\nThe Indians immediately struck across the country, reaching the West\r\nBranch of the Susquehanna near the mouth of the Sinnemahoning Creek.\r\nThey also had another prisoner named Ross, who was wounded even more\r\nseverely than Boyd, and could travel no farther. He was fastened to a\r\nstake, with his arms tied behind his back; his body was cut with sharp\r\npoints and pitch-pine splinters stuck into the incisions; the fire was\r\nlighted and the savages danced around him in fiendish glee. His tortures\r\nwere terrible before death relieved him.\r\n\r\nDuring this tragic scene Captain Boyd, faint from the loss of blood, was\r\ntied to a small oak sapling, in such a position that he could not\r\nrefrain from being a silent spectator of the horrible scene; realizing\r\nthat he was soon to suffer the same tortures.\r\n\r\nHe summoned up all his courage and resigned himself to his fate.\r\nCertainly his thoughts must have reminded him of the sufferings of his\r\nheroic brother only two years before, almost in the same manner.\r\n\r\nWhile the incarnate fiends were making preparations to torture him to\r\ndeath by inches, he sang a pretty Masonic song, with a plaintive air\r\nwhich attracted their attention and they listened to it closely until it\r\nwas finished. At this critical moment an old squaw came up and claimed\r\nhim for her son. The Indians did not interfere and she immediately\r\ndressed his wounds and attended to his comfort, carefully guarding him\r\nduring their journey to Canada.\r\n\r\nThis old squaw accompanied Captain Boyd to Quebec, where he was placed\r\nin a hospital and attended by an English surgeon. When he recovered he\r\nwas turned out on the street without a penny or a friend.\r\n\r\nHe found a Masonic Inn and made himself known to the proprietor who\r\ncared for him until he was exchanged.\r\n\r\nThe old squaw who befriended him belonged to the Oneida tribe. Captain\r\nBoyd remembered her kindly as one of his best friends and frequently\r\nsent her presents of money and trinkets. On one occasion he made a\r\njourney north to visit her in her aboriginal home and personally thank\r\nher for saving his life.\r\n\r\nCaptain Boyd, in partnership with Colonel William Wilson, operated a\r\nmill on Chillisquaque Creek, Northumberland County, for many years.\r\n\r\nHe was one of the surviving officers who enjoyed the provisions of the\r\nact of Congress, May, 1828.\r\n\r\nHe was a delegate to the convention which ratified the Federal\r\nConstitution December 12, 1787.\r\n\r\nHe was an elector of President and Vice President in 1792, when he voted\r\nfor Washington and Adams. He was appointed by President Washington\r\nInspector of Internal Revenue for Pennsylvania. He also served as\r\nRegister and Recorder of Northumberland County.\r\n\r\nCaptain Boyd married May 13, 1794, Rebecca, daughter of Colonel John\r\nBull, famous Revolutionary officer. They were the parents of five\r\ndaughters and two sons. He died February 23, 1831.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Simon Girty, the Renegade, and Indians\r\n                    Attacked Fort Laurens, February\r\n                                23,1779\r\n\r\n\r\nBrigadier General Lachlan McIntosh, who had been sent by Congress and\r\nGeneral Washington to restore peace on the harried western frontier of\r\nPennsylvania, relieved General Edward Hand of his command at Fort Pitt.\r\n\r\nA treaty of peace with the Delaware Indians was concluded September 17,\r\n1778, and General McIntosh immediately prepared an expedition against\r\nthe British post at Detroit.\r\n\r\nOn October 1, the army, consisting of 1300 troops, of whom 500 were\r\nregulars of the Eighth Pennsylvania and Thirteenth Virginia, marched\r\nfrom Fort Pitt down the Ohio, to the mouth of the Beaver.\r\n\r\nFour weeks were occupied in building a fort within the present town of\r\nBeaver, which was named Fort McIntosh, in honor of the commanding\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\nA herd of lean cattle arrived at Fort McIntosh November 3, and on the\r\n5th the army began its march, but they did not reach the Tuscarawas\r\nRiver until November 19.\r\n\r\nIn accord with a provision in the treaty with the Delaware, General\r\nMcIntosh was pledged to erect a protection for the Indian women and\r\nchildren. During the march to the Tuscarawas a Delaware chief was shot\r\nby a Virginia militiaman, and many Indians deserted the American force.\r\n\r\nGeneral McIntosh, with great reluctance, determined not to continue the\r\ncampaign so late in the year, and to employ the troops and make a show\r\nof enterprise, he began the construction of a stockade fort at\r\nTuscarawas, where the army then encamped and from which place it would\r\nagain set out in the spring on another attempt against Detroit.\r\n\r\nThe fort was named Fort Laurens, in honor of the President of the\r\nContinental Congress.\r\n\r\nBefore this fort was finished General McIntosh realized he could not get\r\nforward a sufficient quantity of provisions to maintain his large force\r\nin the Indian country long enough even for an expedition against the\r\nSandusky towns.\r\n\r\nThe Virginians were enlisted only until the end of the year, the weather\r\nbecame intensely cold, starvation and deep snows threatened, which\r\nseemed enough to discourage any commander and the general was forced to\r\nmarch his army to the Ohio.\r\n\r\nHe left 150 men of the Thirteenth Virginia, under command of Colonel\r\nJohn Gibson, one of the stoutest-hearted of the frontiersmen. Colonel\r\nDaniel Brodhead, of Northampton County, with a detachment of the Eighth\r\nPennsylvania, formed the winter garrison at Fort McIntosh, while General\r\nMcIntosh took up his quarters at Fort Pitt much chagrined over his\r\ndisappointments.\r\n\r\nThe little garrison at Fort Laurens experienced a terrible winter. They\r\nwere short of food and clothing. The troops hunted until driven out of\r\nthe woods by the hostile Indians.\r\n\r\nThe erection of this fort in the very heart of the Indian country\r\ngreatly provoked the Wyandot, Miami and Mingo tribes, and they plotted\r\nits destruction. Early in January, 1779, they began to prowl about the\r\npost.\r\n\r\nGeneral McIntosh promised to send provisions to the post by the middle\r\nof January, and Captain John Clark, of the Eighth Pennsylvania, was sent\r\nfrom McIntosh with fifteen men to convoy the pack horses loaded with\r\nflour and meat to the relief of the post on the Tuscarawas.\r\n\r\nThis detail reached the fort January 21, and two days later set out on\r\ntheir return to the Ohio. Three miles from the fort the party was\r\nattacked from ambush by seventeen Mingo Indians, under the leadership of\r\nSimon Girty, the renegade and Tory, and two soldiers were killed, four\r\nwounded and one captured.\r\n\r\nCaptain Clark was forced back to Fort Laurens, but a few days afterward\r\nhe again started and led his little detail through without molestation.\r\nGirty led his captive soldier to Detroit, and while there raised a much\r\nlarger force and returned to the vicinity of Fort Laurens, where he\r\narrived about the middle of February.\r\n\r\nFort Laurens was now surrounded by a band of 200 Miami and Mingo Indians\r\nled by Girty and Captain Henry Bird. Colonel Gibson succeeded in sending\r\na messenger through the savage lines, who carried the distressing news\r\nto General McIntosh.\r\n\r\nOn February 23, 1779, a wagon was sent out from the fort under an escort\r\nof eighteen soldiers to haul some firewood which had been cut by the\r\ntroops. About a half a mile from the fort the little party passed an\r\nancient Indian mound behind which a band of Indians lay hidden. The\r\nIndians burst upon them, both front and rear, and every man in the\r\ndetail was killed and scalped except two, who were taken prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe Indians then planned a regular siege upon the fort and endeavored to\r\nstarve the garrison into surrender.\r\n\r\nColonel Gibson dispatched another messenger, who eluded the watchful\r\nIndians and reached Fort McCord March 3.\r\n\r\nIn the interim the condition in the garrison became desperate. A sortie\r\nin force was contemplated but the strength of the savages caused this\r\nplan to be abandoned. The Indians paraded over the crest of the hill\r\nwithin plain sight, and about 850 warriors were counted. It was\r\nafterward learned that 200 had been marched to make a show, four times\r\nthe strength.\r\n\r\nCaptain Bird after this stratagem, sent in a demand for surrender,\r\npromising safe passage for the soldiers to Fort McIntosh, but Gibson\r\nsternly refused. The Indians then promised to withdraw if Gibson would\r\nfurnish them with a barrel of flour and a barrel of meat.\r\n\r\nBird believed the garrison was reduced to its last ration and would, of\r\nnecessity, refuse the request, and therefore he felt certain that in a\r\nfew days the garrison must surrender.\r\n\r\nGibson had but a few barrels of food, and that in bad condition; but he\r\nquickly complied with the demand, sent out two barrels and said he had\r\nplenty yet inside. They enjoyed a feast on the flour and meat, and on\r\nthe following day left that vicinity and returned to their towns in\r\nNorthwestern Ohio.\r\n\r\nOn March 23, General McIntosh appeared with his relieving force of 300\r\nregulars and 200 militia escorting a train of pack horses with\r\nprovisions. For more than a week the men had subsisted on roots and soup\r\nmade by boiling raw hides.\r\n\r\nThe famished troops sallied forth, and fired a volley to express their\r\njoy. The shooting frightened the pack horses, causing them to stampede\r\nthrough the woods, scattering food in every direction. Many of the\r\nhorses were never recovered and the food lost.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of May the garrison was compelled to return to Fort\r\nMcIntosh to escape actual starvation. The fort was finally dismantled\r\nand the men returned to Fort Pitt.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               General Jacob Brown, Hero of War of 1812,\r\n                   Died February 24, 1828; Native of\r\n                              Pennsylvania\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen General Jacob Brown died in Washington, D. C., February 24, 1828, a\r\nmonument was erected over his remains in the historic Congressional\r\nburial ground, which bore the following inscription:\r\n\r\n“Sacred to the memory of General Jacob Brown. He was born in Bucks\r\nCounty, Pennsylvania, on the 9th of May, 1775, and died in the city of\r\nWashington, commanding-general of the army, on the 24th of February,\r\n1828.\r\n\r\n                  “Let him who e’er in after days\r\n                  Shall view this monument of praise,\r\n                  For honor heave the patriot sigh\r\n                  And for his country learn to die.”\r\n\r\nThen this surely was an unusual man and such is the fact.\r\n\r\nHe was born of Quaker parentage, in the house long since known as the\r\nWarner mansion, about three and a half miles below Morrisville, on the\r\nbanks of the Delaware River, where his father lived until the son Jacob\r\nwas grown, and they removed to New York toward the close of the century.\r\n\r\nFrom his eighteenth to his twenty-first year Jacob Brown taught school\r\nat Crosswicks, N. J., and passed the next two years in surveying lands\r\nin Ohio.\r\n\r\nIn 1798 he opened a select school in New York City, and at the same time\r\nstudied law.\r\n\r\nSome of his newspaper essays attracted the attention of General\r\nAlexander Hamilton, to whom he became secretary while that officer was\r\nacting General-in-Chief of the army raised in anticipation of a war with\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nWhen those war clouds disappeared Brown went to northern New York,\r\npurchased lands on the banks of the Black River, not far distant from\r\nSackett’s Harbor, and founded the flourishing settlement of Brownsville,\r\nwhere he erected the first building within thirty miles of Lake Ontario.\r\n\r\nThere Brown became county judge; colonel of the local militia in 1809;\r\nbrigadier general in 1810; and, in 1812, received the appointment of\r\ncommander of the frontier from Oswego to Lake St. Francis, a line two\r\nhundred miles in extent.\r\n\r\nDuring the War of 1812–14, he performed most conspicuous service,\r\nreceiving two severe wounds in battle.\r\n\r\nAt the second attack upon Sackett’s Harbor, May 27, 1813, when the news\r\nof the approach of the British squadron reached there Colonel Backus was\r\nin command. General Jacob Brown was at his home, a few miles distant. He\r\nwas notified and arrived before dawn of the 28th. He sent expresses in\r\nall directions to summon the militia to the field, and fired guns to\r\narouse the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nAs rapidly as the militia came in they were armed and sent to Horse\r\nIsland, where it was expected the enemy would attempt to land. On the\r\nappearance of some American gun boats the British squadron went out on\r\nthe open lake. But when the enemy discovered the real weakness of the\r\ndefenders, the squadron returned on the morning of the 29th and landed a\r\nlarge force on Horse Island.\r\n\r\nThe militia had been withdrawn from the island to the mainland, and fled\r\nat the first fire of the invaders.\r\n\r\nThis disgraceful conduct astonished General Brown, who rallied his\r\ntroops, when he discovered the store houses and a ship in flames, set on\r\nfire by Americans who believed their militia was in full retreat. This\r\ncaused General Brown to redouble his exertions to rally the militia. He\r\nsucceeded, and so turned the fortunes of the day in favor of his\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir George Prevost, mounted on a high stump, saw the rallying\r\nmilitia on his flank and rear, he believed them to be American\r\nreinforcements and sounded a retreat.\r\n\r\nFor his conduct in the defense of Sackett’s Harbor, Brown was made a\r\nbrigadier in the United States Army.\r\n\r\nGeneral Brown made the only redeeming movement in Wilkinson’s\r\ndisgraceful expedition down the St. Lawrence River against Montreal,\r\nNovember, 1813. Brown captured and held the post at the foot of the\r\nrapids, which movement permitted the union of the several armies, or the\r\ndefeat would have been even more disastrous.\r\n\r\nGeneral Brown was severely wounded at the repulse of the British at Fort\r\nErie, August 15, 1814.\r\n\r\nBoth parties prepared to renew the contest, and General Brown remained\r\nin command. On September 17, he stormed the attacking forces by a sortie\r\nfrom the fort, and won a brilliant victory. This saved Fort Erie with\r\nBuffalo, and the stores on the Niagara frontier.\r\n\r\nPublic honors were bestowed upon Generals Brown, Porter and Ripley.\r\nCongress presented each with a gold medal.\r\n\r\nTo the chief commander, General Brown, it was said, “no enterprise which\r\nhe undertook ever failed,” and the city of New York gave him the freedom\r\nof the city in a beautiful gold box. The Governor of New York presented\r\nhim with an elegant sword.\r\n\r\nAt the function in New York City, held February 4, 1815, Mayor DeWitt\r\nClinton presided, and the aldermen and principal citizens hailed him as\r\nthe hero of Chippewa and Lundy’s Lane.\r\n\r\nThe citizens of Philadelphia gave him a great public banquet at\r\nWashington Hall, Chief Justice Tilghman presiding, and Major Jackson,\r\nvice president.\r\n\r\nThe sanguinary battle near the cataract of the Niagara is known in\r\nhistory as the battle of Lundy’s Lane.\r\n\r\nThe British had just been defeated (July 5, 1814), at Chippewa, and were\r\nsmarting under the disgrace of having their veteran troops defeated by\r\nraw Americans.\r\n\r\nGeneral Brown was ably supported by General Scott in this action and\r\nboth were severely wounded. The command devolved upon General Ripley who\r\ndisobeyed General Brown’s orders, lost the advantage of a brilliant\r\nvictory, and was soon replaced by General E. P. Gaines.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the war, General Brown was retained in command of the\r\nnorthern division of the army, and was made general-in-chief, March 10,\r\n1821, which exalted position he held with honor and credit till his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Andrew McFarlane Captured by Indians at\r\n\r\nKittanning February 25, 1777\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Indian depredations along the Ohio River in the fall of 1776 began\r\nalong its eastern shore, when small parties of the Mingo tribe made\r\nincursions among the settlements, inflicting only slight damage. But in\r\nthe spring of 1777, the outrages became general and more destructive.\r\nThe first outrage was on the frontier of Westmoreland County when Andrew\r\nMcFarlane was captured at an outpost of Kittanning.\r\n\r\nMcFarlane soon after the close of the French and Indian War, made his\r\nway west to Fort Pitt, where he engaged in the Indian trade with his\r\nbrother James. When the territorial dispute with Virginia became acute,\r\nin January, 1774, Andrew McFarlane was appointed a justice of the peace\r\nby Governor Penn and he vigorously upheld the Pennsylvania authority.\r\n\r\nCaptain John Connolly, at the head of his Virginia militia, interrupted\r\nthe sessions of the Pennsylvania court at Hannastown, April, 1774, and\r\narrested three Pennsylvania justices, who resided in Pittsburgh; Andrew\r\nMcFarlane, Devereux Smith and Captain Aeneas Mackay. They were taken as\r\nprisoners to Staunton, Va., and there detained four weeks, until\r\nreleased by order of Governor Dunmore.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of his arrest in Pittsburgh, McFarlane managed to send a\r\nletter to Governor Penn, in which he said: “I am taken at a great\r\ninconvenience, as my business is suffering much on account of my\r\nabsence, but I am willing to suffer a great deal more rather than bring\r\na disgrace upon the commission which I bear under your honor.” One\r\nresult of his arrest indicates that McFarlane did not really suffer much\r\nduring his captivity at Staunton for there he met and married Margaret\r\nLynn Lewis, daughter of William Lewis, famed in the military history of\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\nAndrew and James McFarlane, to escape exactions and persecutions of\r\nVirginia military authority, removed their store, in the autumn of 1774,\r\nto Kittanning, at that time the extreme limit of white settlements\r\ntoward the North. Here they prospered.\r\n\r\nWhen the Iroquois tribe began to give concern to the settlers on the\r\nwestern frontier, after the Revolution opened, the Continental Congress\r\nin July 1776, ordered the raising of a regiment consisting of seven\r\ncompanies from Westmoreland and one from Bedford, to build and garrison\r\nforts at Kittanning, Le Boeuf and Erie and protect that region from\r\nBritish and Iroquois.\r\n\r\nThese troops were promptly raised under command of Colonel Aeneas\r\nMackay, with George Wilson, lieutenant colonel, and Richard Butler, as\r\nmajor. This regiment rendezvoused at Kittanning preparatory to an\r\nadvance up the Allegheny, to build two other forts.\r\n\r\nA call was received for the regiment to march eastward, across the\r\nState, and join the hard-pressed army of General Washington, then near\r\nthe Delaware. This regiment obeyed the call, in spite of a storm of\r\nprotest on the frontier, and became known as the Eighth Pennsylvania.\r\nThe long march began early in January, 1777.\r\n\r\nMany settlers believed the western frontier was not in imminent danger\r\nbut Andrew McFarlane was not one of these. As soon as Mackay’s regiment\r\ndeparted Justice McFarlane begged of the Westmoreland Commissioners that\r\na company of militia be sent to Kittanning. He could hardly restrain his\r\nneighbors from running away, and during the late winter many did flee,\r\nleaving McFarlane and two clerks the only men at the place.\r\n\r\nThere were many stores left at Kittanning by Colonel Mackay but no\r\nsoldiers could be spared to guard them. In this emergency Samuel\r\nMoorhead, who lived at Black Lick Creek, undertook the formation of a\r\ncompany of volunteer rangers. He chose McFarlane as his lieutenant, and\r\nthese two spent much time trying to recruit a small company from the\r\nscattered settlers.\r\n\r\nThe story of the capture of Andrew McFarlane is preserved in two forms:\r\nOne is gathered from letters written at the time, while the other is a\r\ntradition handed down in the Lewis family of Virginia. The Lewis story\r\nis now preserved in a history of Lynchburg, Va., and is in part as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n“When Margaret Lynn Lewis married Mr. McFarlane, of Pittsburgh, and left\r\nthe parental roof, she traveled through a wilderness infested with\r\nhostile Indians till she reached that place. Once, when they least\r\napprehended danger, a war whoop was heard, her husband taken prisoner,\r\nthe tomahawk raised and she averted her eyes to avoid witnessing the\r\nfatal stroke.\r\n\r\nThe river was between them and she, with her infant and maid servant, of\r\ncourse endeavored to fly, knowing the inevitable consequences of delay.\r\nAfter starting, the servant reminded Mrs. McFarlane of her husband’s\r\nmoney and valuable papers, but she desired the girl not to mention\r\nanything of that sort at such a moment; but, regardless of the commands\r\nof her mistress, the servant returned to the dwelling, bringing with her\r\nall of the money and as many of the papers as she could hold in her\r\napron, overtaking, in a short time, her mistress, as the snow was three\r\nfeet deep. On looking back she saw the house in flames, and pursuing\r\ntheir journey with incredible fatigue, reached the house of Colonel\r\nCrawford, a distance of fourteen miles.\r\n\r\nThe contemporary account of this event is found in letters from the\r\nfrontier, written to the officers of the Pennsylvania Government at\r\nPhiladelphia and made public in later years. “Two British subalterns,\r\ntwo Chippewa and two Iroquois Indians were sent by the commandant of\r\nFort Niagara, to descend to Allegheny.\r\n\r\n“On February 25, 1777, they arrived opposite the little settlement of\r\nKittanning. Standing on the shore, they shouted toward the far shore,\r\ncalling for a canoe. Thinking the Indians had come to trade or to bring\r\nimportant news McFarlane decided to venture across. The instant he\r\nstepped from his boat he was seized by the savages and told he was their\r\nprisoner. His capture was witnessed by his wife and some men at the\r\nsettlement.”\r\n\r\nAt the time Andrew McFarlane was captured, his brother James was a\r\nlieutenant in the First Pennsylvania of the Continental Line. It was\r\nthrough his personal efforts that Andrew was exchanged, in the fall of\r\n1780. The released man immediately rejoined his wife and child at\r\nStaunton, and they soon afterward returned to the vicinity of\r\nPittsburgh. Kittanning being deserted and exposed, Andrew McFarlane\r\nopened a store on Chartier’s Creek, where he lived for many years.\r\n\r\nHis eldest son, Andrew, doubtless the infant whom Mrs. McFarlane carried\r\nin her arms when she fled from Kittanning, became one of the pioneer\r\nsettlers on the Shenango, near the present New Castle, Pa., and his\r\ndescendants are numerous in Lawrence County.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Westmoreland County, Last Under Proprietary,\r\n\r\nErected February 26, 1773\r\n\r\n\r\nThe county of Westmoreland was erected by the Assembly of the Province\r\nof Pennsylvania by an act of February 26, 1773. It was the eleventh\r\ncounty in Pennsylvania and the last erected under the Proprietary\r\nGovernment. Like all the other counties, except Philadelphia, it\r\nreceived its name from a county in England.\r\n\r\nIn 1771 this wide region was included in the county of Bedford, but\r\nsettlements grew so rapidly west of the mountains during the year 1772\r\nthat a new frontier county was demanded. The evacuation of Fort Pitt by\r\nthe British troops in the fall of 1772 also led the frontiersmen to\r\ndemand a stronger civil government.\r\n\r\nWhen Westmoreland was erected it included all the Province west of\r\nLaurel Hill, being what is broadly known as Southwestern Pennsylvania\r\nand included what is now Westmoreland, Fayette, Washington, Greene, and\r\nthe parts of Allegheny and Beaver Counties south of the Ohio River and\r\nabout two-thirds of Indiana and one-third of Armstrong County, a total\r\narea of 4,700 square miles.\r\n\r\nWhile this was the area of Westmoreland County in the intent of the\r\nProvincial Government, it was restricted in fact by Virginia’s seizure\r\nand government of a large portion of the territory.\r\n\r\nA general settlement of the country west of the Allegheny Mountains did\r\nnot begin until after the land office was opened in April, 1769.\r\n\r\nThe settlers flocked into this new region from two directions. The Scots\r\nfrom the Cumberland Valley and other settled posts of the Province made\r\ntheir way westward along the Forbes military road and planted their\r\ncabins along its course. These men were loyal Pennsylvanians, and they\r\nheld their lands under the Provincial Government. Other Scots came from\r\nthe South, principally from the Old Dominion; they crossed the mountains\r\nby the Braddock road and occupied the fertile lands along the\r\nMonongahela and Youghiogheny Rivers and Chartiers Creek. These men were\r\nVirginians and believed their settlements were still within that\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nA lively contest was carried on between Pennsylvania and Virginia for\r\ncontrol of this region, and the organization of Westmoreland County had\r\nsignal influence in strengthening the Pennsylvania authority, especially\r\nwhen sixteen magistrates were commissioned to administer justice within\r\nits boundaries.\r\n\r\nThe county seat was established at Robert Hanna’s little settlement on\r\nForbes Road, about thirty-five miles east of Fort Pitt, and here at\r\nHannastown, the first Pennsylvania court, west of the mountains, was\r\nheld April 13, 1773. It was a Court of Quarter Sessions and William\r\nCrawford presided. These proceedings stirred up the Virginia\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Dunmore, Governor of Virginia, took forcible possession of\r\nthe disputed territory. He appointed John Connolly, of Pittsburgh,\r\n“captain commandant of Pittsburgh and its dependencies.”\r\n\r\nConnolly mustered the militia under the Virginia law, seized and\r\ngarrisoned Fort Pitt, intimidated the Pennsylvania magistrates, marched\r\nsome of them off to prison, and established the authority of Virginia\r\nthroughout all the region between the Monongahela and the Ohio.\r\nPennsylvania had no militia law at that time and was powerless to resist\r\nthe usurpation.\r\n\r\nBy this action upon the part of Virginia the territory of Westmoreland\r\nCounty, during the period of the Revolution, was limited to about half\r\nits actual area. It was not until the summer of 1780 that Virginia\r\nfinally agreed to accept the results of a joint survey which would\r\nextend the southern boundary line of Pennsylvania to a distance of 5\r\ndegrees of longitude west of the Delaware River.\r\n\r\nLigonier Valley, which extends along the eastern border of the county,\r\nwas well settled by 1775, the largest settlement being Ligonier, where\r\nthe British had built a fort in 1758. The principal citizen here was\r\nCaptain, afterwards General Arthur St. Clair, a Scotchman who served\r\nunder Wolfe at Quebec and afterwards became the agent of the Penn family\r\nin Western Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nSettlements also became numerous west of Chestnut Ridge, along the\r\nLoyalhanna and its tributaries, as far as Hannastown on the Forbes Road.\r\nDerry settlement was to the north of the road, between the Loyalhanna\r\nand the Conemaugh. Nearly all the settlers were Scots from Ulster, or\r\ntheir immediate descendants, with a sprinkling of Irish of Presbyterian\r\nfaith. There was another Ulster settlement at the Braddock road crossing\r\nof Big Sewickley Creek, while lower down that stream were cabins and\r\nblockhouses of German emigrants from the Rhine Palatinate.\r\n\r\nThe Virginia settlers along the Monongahela and Youghiogheny were a\r\ngeneration or more removed from the old country, but were nearly all of\r\nScotch stock. The richest of these brought their slaves with them from\r\nVirginia, who were held in bondage long after the Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe traders and principal citizens in the vicinity of Fort Pitt were\r\nmembers of the Church of England; it was from among these that the Tory\r\nsentiment developed during the Revolution. Old Westmoreland was,\r\nhowever, decidedly a Scotch and Calvinistic settlement.\r\n\r\nThe Scotch pioneers were bold, stout and industrious men, sharp at\r\nbargains, fond of religious and political controversy and not strongly\r\nattached to government either of the royal or the proprietary brand. In\r\nnearly every cabin could be found three principal articles, the Bible, a\r\nrifle and a whiskey jug. Their hatred of the treacherous Indian was a\r\nstrong characteristic.\r\n\r\nIn 1775 the most prominent representatives of the Pennsylvania\r\ninterests, in addition to General Arthur St. Clair, were Colonel John\r\nProctor and Colonel Archibald Lochry, who lived near the Forbes Road,\r\nwest of Chestnut Ridge; Robert Hanna and Michael Huffnagle, of\r\nHannastown; James Cavet and Christopher Hays, of Sewickley; John Ormsby,\r\nDevereux Smith and Aeneas Mackay, traders and storekeepers at\r\nPittsburgh; Edward Cook, near Redstone, and George Wilson, whose\r\nplantation was in the very heart of the Virginia sympathizers, on the\r\nMonongahela at the mouth of George’s Creek.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Early Days of Witchcraft in Pennsylvania—Two\r\n                    Women on Trial February 27, 1683\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous of the early provincial tribunals and by far the\r\nbest known to the present-day reader was the Provincial Council. Its\r\nduties were at once executive, legislative and judicial.\r\n\r\nThe judicial functions discharged by the members of the Council were\r\nboth interesting and important, and the volume of such business was very\r\ngreat. Its members were regarded by all classes as the supreme judges of\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\nThe trial of Margaret Mattson, which took place on February 27, 1683,\r\nbefore William Penn himself, is of great interest, both on account of\r\nthe peculiarity of the accusation and the notoriety it has acquired as\r\nillustrating the temper of our ancestors.\r\n\r\nThe records of the early Provincial Council contain this item:\r\n\r\n“1683, 7th, 12th mo., Margaret Mattson and Yethro Hendrickson were\r\nexamined and about to be proved witches; whereupon this board ordered\r\nthat Neels Mattson should enter into a recognizance of fifty pounds for\r\nhis wife’s appearance before this board on the 27th instant. Hendrick\r\nJacobson doth the same for his wife.”\r\n\r\n“27th of the 12th mo. Margaret Mattson’s indictment was read, and she\r\npleads not guilty, and will be tryed by ye country.”\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of historical interest that the Council was then composed\r\nof William Penn, Proprietor and Governor, and James Harrison, William\r\nBiles, Lasse Cock, William Haigue, Chris Taylor, William Clayton and\r\nThomas Holmes.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Jury was as follows: Robert Euer, foreman; Samuel Carpenter,\r\nAndrew Griscom, Benjamin Whiteman, John Barnes, Samuel Allen, John\r\nParsons, Richard Orne, John Day, John Fisher, John Barnes, Gunner Rambo,\r\nEnoch Flower, Henry Drystreet, Thomas Mosse, Thomas Duckett, Dennis\r\nLince, Thomas Phillips, Thomas Millard, John Yattman and Harnaby Wilcox.\r\n\r\nThe petit jury was composed of John Hastings, foreman; Robert Wade,\r\nWilliam Hewes, John Gibbons, Albortus Hendrickson, Nathaniel Evans,\r\nJeremiah Collett, Walter Martin, Robert Piles, Edward Carter, John\r\nKinsman and Edward Bezac.\r\n\r\nThe evidence adduced against the prisoner was of the most trifling\r\ncharacter, and such as now would be scouted from the witness-box of a\r\ncourt of justice.\r\n\r\n“Henry Drystreet, one of the Grand Jurors attested, saith he was tould\r\n20 years agoe that the prisoner at the Barr was a witch and that\r\nseverall cows were bewitcht by her, also that James Sunderling’s mother\r\ntould that she bewitcht her cow but afterwards said it was a mistake and\r\nthat her cow should doe well againe for it was not her cow but another\r\npersons that should dye.\r\n\r\n“Charles Ashcom attested, saith, that Anthony’s wife being asked why she\r\nsould her cattle was because his mother had bewitcht them having taken\r\nthe witchcraft off of Hendricks cattle and put on their oxen, she might\r\nkeep but noe other cattle; and also that one night the Daughter of the\r\nPrisoner called him up hastily and when he came she sayd there was a\r\ngreat Light but just before and an old woman with a knife in her hand at\r\nthe Bedd’s feet and therefore shee cryed out and desired Jno. Symcock to\r\ntake away his calves or else she would send them to Hell.\r\n\r\n“Annakey Coolin attested, saith, her husband tooke the heart of a calfe\r\nthat dyed as they thought by witchcraft and Boyled it whereupon the\r\nPrisoner at the Barr came in and asked them what they were doing, they\r\nsaid boyling of flesh, she said they had better they had boyled the\r\nbones with severall other unseemly Expressions.\r\n\r\n“Margaret Mattson saith that she values not Drystreets Evidence but if\r\nSunderlin’s mother had come she would have answered her also denyeth\r\nCharles Ashcoms attestation at her soul and saith where is my daughter\r\nlett her come and say so.\r\n\r\n“Annakey Coolin’s attestation concerning the Gees she denyeth, saying\r\nshe was never out of her conoo, and also that she never said any such\r\nthings concerning the calves heart.\r\n\r\n“The Prisoner denyeth all things and saith that ye witnesses speake only\r\nby hear say.\r\n\r\n“After which the Govr. gave the jury their charge concerning ye Prisoner\r\nat ye Barr.\r\n\r\n“The jury went forth and upon their Returne brought her in Guilty of\r\nhaving the common fame of a witch but not Guilty in the manner and forme\r\nas she stands indicted.\r\n\r\n“Neels Mattson and Anthon. Neelson Enters into Recognizance of fifty\r\npounds apiece for the good behavior of Margaret Mattson for six months.”\r\n\r\nIn 1695 Robert Roman, presented by the grand inquest of Chester County\r\nfor practicing geomancy according to Hidon, and divining by a stick. He\r\nsubmitted himself to the bench and was fined £5, and his books, Hidon’s\r\nTemple of Wisdom, Scott’s Discovery of Witchcraft, and Cornelius\r\nAgrippa’s Geomancy, were ordered to be taken from him and brought into\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\nIn 1701 a petition of Robert Guard and his wife was read before Council,\r\nsetting forth “That a certain strange woman lately arrived in this town,\r\nbeing seized with a very sudden illness after she had been in their\r\ncompany on the 17th instant, and several pins being taken out of her\r\nbreasts, one John Richards Butler and his wife Ann charged the\r\npetitioners with witchcraft and as being the authors of the said\r\nmischief.” A summons was issued accordingly, but the matter, being\r\njudged trifling, was dismissed.\r\n\r\nEven as late as 1719, the Commissions to the justices of Chester County\r\nempowered them to inquire of all “witchcrafts, enchantments, sorceries\r\nand magic arts.”\r\n\r\nGeorge Shrunk, of Germantown, known as “Old Shrunk,” was a great\r\nconjuror and many persons from Philadelphia and elsewhere went to him to\r\nlearn where stolen goods were secreted and to have him tell their\r\nfortunes. They believed he could make any thieves stand still, while\r\nthey desired to run away. They believed he could tell them where to dig\r\nfor money and hidden treasures, and this brought “Old Shrunk” much\r\nbusiness, for the idea was very prevalent that the pirates of\r\nBlackbeard’s day had deposited treasures along the Delaware and\r\nSchuylkill Rivers.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Towns Laid Out in Erie County by Act of\r\n                      Assembly, February 28, 1794\r\n\r\n\r\nThe frontiers of Pennsylvania had not been seriously harassed by the\r\nIndians since the close of the Revolution, but late in 1793 they again\r\nbecame restive and early in the following year so many depredations had\r\nbeen committed along the western frontier of the State that the Assembly\r\non February 28, 1794, passed an act for enlisting soldiers for the\r\ndefense of the Delaware River and the western frontiers. At the same\r\ntime efforts were made toward the laying out of a town at Presqu’ Isle,\r\n“in order to facilitate and promote the progress of settlement within\r\nthe Commonwealth and to afford additional security to the frontiers\r\nthereof.”\r\n\r\nGovernor Mifflin transmitted to the President of the United States a\r\ncopy of this act, apprehending the difficulties which soon manifested\r\nthemselves. Prior to this he had sent to Captain Ebenezer Denny a\r\ncommission, giving him command of the Allegheny Company, which was\r\nordered to protect William Irvine, Andrew Elliott and Albert Gallatin,\r\nwho had been appointed Commissioners to lay out the town. For the same\r\nobject a post had been established at Le Boeuf, two miles below the old\r\nFrench fort of the same name.\r\n\r\nThe three Commissioners were instructed to lay out 1,600 acres for town\r\nlots and thirty-four acres for out-lots at Erie, the town lots to\r\ncontain about one-third of an acre and the out-lots to contain five\r\nacres. In addition, sixty acres were reserved for the use of the United\r\nStates near the entrance of the harbor for forts, etc. Upon completion\r\nof the surveys the Governor was authorized to offer at auction one-third\r\nof all the lots, conditioned upon the building upon the lots within two\r\nyears of a house with a stone or brick chimney.\r\n\r\nThe troops were busily employed to protect the surveyors from the\r\nincursions of the Indians. Miss Sanford in her History of Erie County\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n“Thomas Rees, Esq., for more than half a century a citizen of Erie\r\nCounty, made a deposition in 1806 as follows: ‘Thomas Rees of Harbor\r\nCreek Township, in Erie County, farmer, being sworn according to law,\r\netc. I was appointed deputy surveyor of District No. 1 north and west of\r\nthe rivers Ohio, Allegheny and Connewango Creek, now Erie County, in\r\nMay, 1792, and opened an office in Northumberland County, which was the\r\nadjoining. The reason of this was, all the accounts of the country north\r\nand west of the rivers, Ohio, Allegheny, and the Connewango Creek,\r\nrepresented it as dangerous to go into the country. In the latter part\r\nof said year I received three hundred and ninety warrants, the property\r\nof the Penn Population company for land situated in the Triangle and\r\nentered the same year in my book of entries. In 1793 I made an attempt\r\nto go; went to the mouth of Buffalo Creek to inquire of the Indians\r\nthere whether they would permit me to go into my district to make\r\nsurveys. They refused and added that if I went into the country I would\r\nbe killed. At the same time I received information from different\r\nquarters which prevented me from going that year.\r\n\r\n“‘In 1794 I went into District No. 1, now Erie County, and made surveys\r\non the three hundred and ninety warrants, mentioned above in the\r\nTriangle, except one or two for which no lands could be found. Among the\r\nsurveys made on the warrants above mentioned, was that on the warrant in\r\nthe name of John McCullough.\r\n\r\n“‘Before I had completed I was frequently alarmed by hearing of Indians\r\nkilling persons on the Allegheny River, in consequence of which, as soon\r\nas the surveys were completed, I moved from the country and went to\r\nFranklin, where I was informed that there were a number of Indians\r\nbelonging to the Six Nations going to Le Boeuf to order the troops off\r\nthat ground. I immediately returned to Le Boeuf. The Indians had left\r\nthe place one day before I arrived there. I was told by Major Denny,\r\nthen commanding at that place, that the Indians had brought General\r\nChapin, the Indian agent, with them to Le Boeuf; that they were very\r\nmuch displeased, and told him not to build a garrison at Presqu’ Isle.\r\n\r\n“‘There were no improvements made, nor any person living on any tract of\r\nland within my district during the year 1794.\r\n\r\n“‘In 1795 I went into the country and took a number of men with me. We\r\nkept in a body, as there appeared to be great danger, and continued so\r\nfor that season. There was no work done of any consequence, nor was any\r\nperson, to my knowledge, residing on any tract within my district. In\r\nthe course of the summer the Commissioners came on to lay out the town\r\nof Erie, with a company of men to guard them.\r\n\r\n“There were two persons killed within one mile of Presqu’ Isle, and\r\nothers in different parts of the country. Such were the fears that\r\nthough some did occasionally venture out to view the lands, many would\r\nnot. We all laid under the protection of the troops. I sold, as agent of\r\nthe Penn Population Company, during that season, 79,700 acres of land,\r\nof which 7,150 acres were a gratuity. The above quantity of land was\r\napplied for and sold to 200 persons. That fall we left the country,’”\r\n\r\nCaptain Martin Strong, of Waterford, who had arrived at Presqu’ Isle the\r\nlast of July, 1795, said:\r\n\r\n“A few days previous to this a company of United States troops had\r\ncommenced felling the timber on Garrison hill, headed by General\r\nElliott, escorted by a company of Pennsylvania militia commanded by\r\nCaptain John Grubb, to lay out the town of Erie. We were in some degree\r\nunder martial law, the two Rutledges having been shot a few days before\r\n(July 26 or 27) by the Indians near the present site of the present\r\nrailway depot.\r\n\r\n“In 1795 there were but four families residing in what is now Erie\r\nCounty. These were the names of Reed, Talmadge, Miles and Baird. The\r\nfirst mill built in the Triangle was at the mouth of Walnut Creek; there\r\nwere two others built about the same time in what is now Erie County;\r\none by William Miles, on the north branch of French Creek, now Union;\r\nthe other by William Culbertson, at the inlet of Conneautte Lake, near\r\nEdinboro.”\r\n\r\nIn spite of all these preparations, the Legislature suspended the laying\r\nout of a town at Presqu’ Isle, and it was not until April 18, 1795, the\r\ndifficulties were removed and the Assembly authorized the laying out of\r\nthe towns at Le Boeuf, at the mouth of Conewango Creek, at the mouth of\r\nFrench Creek and at Presqu’ Isle.\r\n\r\nJuly 25, 1796, the Harrisburg and Presqu’ Isle Company was formed “for\r\nthe settling, improving and populating the country near and adjoining to\r\nLake Erie.”\r\n\r\nErie County was erected March 12, 1800, and Erie named as the place for\r\nholding courts of justice, but it was not organized judicially until\r\nApril, 1803, when Judge Jesse Moore held the first court near French and\r\nThird Streets.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Commissioners Appointed to Purchase Last\r\n                    Indian Lands, February 29, 1784\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Maclay, Samuel John Atlee and Francis Johnson were appointed\r\nFebruary 29, 1784, by the Supreme Executive Council to be Commissioners\r\nto treat with the Indians claiming the unpurchased territory within the\r\nacknowledged limits of the State.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the Revolution, in 1783, the ownership of a large area\r\nof the territory within the charter boundaries of Pennsylvania was still\r\nclaimed by the Indians of the several tribes that were commonly known as\r\nthe Six Nations.\r\n\r\nThe last purchase of lands from these Indians by the Proprietaries was\r\nmade at Fort Stanwix, November 5, 1768. The Indian claim, therefore,\r\nembraced all that part of the State lying to the northwest of the\r\npurchase lines of 1768.\r\n\r\nAs early as March 12, 1783, the General Assembly had passed an act\r\nsetting apart certain lands lying north and west of the Ohio and\r\nAllegheny Rivers and Conewango Creek to be sold for the purpose of\r\nredeeming the depreciation certificates given to the officers and\r\nsoldiers of the Pennsylvania Line, and for the purpose of making\r\ndonations of land to the same officers and soldiers in compliance with a\r\nresolution adopted in 1780.\r\n\r\nAt the time this resolution was adopted the Indian claim of title to\r\nthese lands was still in force, but the authorities were fully alive to\r\nthe necessity of securing the right to all the lands within the\r\nState—about five-sixteenths of its area—that remained unpurchased after\r\nthe treaty of 1768.\r\n\r\nSeptember 25, 1783, the General Assembly placed itself on record in the\r\nform of a resolution which recommended the appointment of a committee to\r\ndevise ways and means for this acquisition.\r\n\r\nThe three persons named as commissioners acknowledged their appointment\r\nto the trust May 17, and recommended that Samuel Weiser, a son of\r\nColonel Conrad Weiser, a proper person to notify the Indians of the\r\ndesire to treat with them, as he was familiar with their language and\r\ncustoms and could also act as interpreter.\r\n\r\nThe Continental Congress had likewise appointed Commissioners to meet\r\nthe Six Nations for the purpose of purchasing lands beyond the limits of\r\nPennsylvania, and these arranged for the meeting at Fort Stanwix. The\r\nCommissioners of Pennsylvania reached Fort Stanwix early in the month of\r\nOctober, where they found some of the tribes already assembled, and with\r\nthem the Commissioners of the Continental Congress.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations continued until the twenty-third of the month, and on\r\nthat day ended in an agreement by which the Indian title to all the\r\nlands within the boundaries of the State that remained after the title\r\nof 1768 was extinguished. The consideration agreed upon for this\r\nsurrender of their rights was $5,000.\r\n\r\nThis deed, dated October 23, 1784, is signed by all the chiefs of the\r\nSix Nations and by the Continental Commissioners as witnesses.\r\n\r\nThe territory thus acquired included a part of the present Bradford,\r\nTioga, Clinton, Center, Clearfield, Indiana, Armstrong, Allegheny and\r\nBeaver Counties, and all of the land within Crawford, Mercer, Lawrence,\r\nButler, Venango, Clarion, Forest, Jefferson, Elk, Warren, McKean, Potter\r\nand Cameron Counties and all of Erie County, excepting the small portion\r\nof the Erie triangle which did not become a part of Erie County until\r\n1792.\r\n\r\nAfter the Commissioners had accomplished in so satisfactory a manner the\r\nobject for which they journeyed to Fort Stanwix, it became necessary to\r\nappease the Western Indians, the Wyandot and the Delaware, who also\r\nclaimed rights to the same lands.\r\n\r\nThe same Commissioners were therefore sent to Fort Mcintosh, on the Ohio\r\nRiver, at the site of the present town of Beaver, where in January,\r\n1785, they were successful in reaching an agreement with those Indians\r\nfor the same lands. This deed, signed by the chiefs of both tribes, is\r\ndated January 21, 1785, and is in the same words (except as to the\r\nconsideration money, which is $2,000) and recites the same boundaries as\r\nthe deed signed at Fort Stanwix.\r\n\r\nThe Indian claim of right to the soil of Pennsylvania, within its\r\ncharter limits, had thus, in a period of a little more than one hundred\r\nyears ceased to exist.\r\n\r\nThis large and important division of our great Commonwealth, now teeming\r\nwith population and wealth, thriving villages, busy towns and great\r\ncities, was, in 1784, largely an uninhabited and untraversed wilderness.\r\n\r\nAfter the purchase of 1768 a disagreement arose between the Proprietary\r\nGovernment and the Indians as to whether the creek flowing into the West\r\nBranch of the Susquehanna, and called in the deed “Tyadaghton” was\r\nintended for Lycoming Creek or Pine Creek. The Indians said it was the\r\nformer, the proprietaries claimed the latter stream to be the extent of\r\nthe purchase, but in order to avoid any trouble that might arise from\r\nthe dispute, it was wisely determined that no rights should be granted\r\nfor lands west of Lycoming Creek.\r\n\r\nThis determination, however, did not deter or prevent adventurous\r\npioneers from making settlements within the disputed territory.\r\n\r\nThese settlers, being classed as outlaws, were compelled to enter into\r\nan agreement for their government and protection. This resulted in an\r\norganization known as Fair Play Men.\r\n\r\nIt is handed down as a tradition that they met when and where the\r\nexigencies arose, and on short notice, tried the case at hand.\r\n\r\nIt is related that when a squatter refused to abide by the decision of\r\nthe court, he was immediately placed in a canoe, in which was a small\r\nquantity of food, then rowed to the mouth of Lycoming Creek, the\r\nboundary line of civilization, and there sent adrift down the river.\r\n\r\nThese Fair Play courts were composed of three commissioners as they were\r\ntermed, and after hearing a case and making a decision, there was no\r\nappeal.\r\n\r\nAfter the purchase of 1784 it was discovered that the trouble was likely\r\nto arise with the original squatters and the Legislature passed an act\r\nentitling those who had made actual settlement prior to 1780, the\r\nbenefit of pre-emption to their respective possessions.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               First Law to Educate Poor Children Signed\r\n\r\nMarch 1, 1802\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same earnest solicitude for public education which made itself\r\nmanifest in the settlement of the New England Colonies in an unusual\r\ndegree does not run through the early history of Pennsylvania, yet,\r\noutside of the Puritan settlements, there was no other colony which paid\r\nso much attention as Pennsylvania to the mental training of youth.\r\n\r\nDuring the seventeenth century the general character of the province, as\r\nregards the intelligence of its people, stood deservedly high. The\r\nschool-house, with its inevitable concomitant, the printing-press, never\r\nat any time ceased to exert its wholesome influence in training up a\r\npopulation which as regards sobriety, thrift, and all the substantial\r\nqualities that flow from instructions, has never been surpassed by any\r\nother great community.\r\n\r\nWilliam Penn, who was one of the most accomplished scholars of his time,\r\nnever wearied in pointing out to the colony the advantages of public\r\neducation. The Constitution which he proposed for the infant\r\nCommonwealth contains the direction that virtue and wisdom must be\r\npropagated by educating the youth, and that after ages would have the\r\nbenefit of the care and prudence of the founders in this respect.\r\n\r\nIt was one of the provisions of the great law of April 25, 1683, that\r\n“schools should be established for the education of the young” and those\r\nin authority did not long delay in carrying it into practical effect.\r\n\r\nOn December 26, 1683, the subject of education was brought up in the\r\nProvincial Council, when it was agreed that there existed a great\r\nnecessity for a schoolmaster. Accordingly an agreement was entered into\r\nwith Enoch Flower, who promised that in conducting such an establishment\r\nas was needed he would charge only four shillings for teaching English\r\neach quarter, six shillings for reading, writing and costing accounts. A\r\nscholar who boarded with him would receive his tuition as well as his\r\nlodging, meals and washing for £10 a year.\r\n\r\nThis was the first regular English school in Pennsylvania. There had\r\nbeen schools during the ascendancy of the Swedes and the Dutch. The\r\nformer are known to have maintained schools at Chester and Tinicum as\r\nearly as 1642, and the Dutch records show that in 1657 Evert Pieterson\r\ncame over from Holland, and in the capacity of “schoolmaster, comforter\r\nof the sick and setter of Psalms,” sought twenty-five pupils.\r\n\r\nIn 1689 George Keith was engaged at a salary of £50 a year, the use of a\r\nhouse, and the profits of the school for one year, to open a grammar\r\nschool in Philadelphia. This institution was a flourishing one for many\r\nyears. Here the children of the poor were instructed free of charge, the\r\nschoolhouse being located on Fourth Street, below Chestnut, and\r\nconducted under a charter which had been procured by Edward Shippen,\r\nDavid Lloyd, John Jones, Samuel Carpenter, Anthony Morris, James Fox,\r\nWilliam Southby and others.\r\n\r\nDarby became the seat of a school in 1692. One was established in\r\nGermantown in 1701, with the learned Pastorius at its head.\r\n\r\nNo church or sect was more active in education than the Moravians, and\r\nschools were established at Germantown, Nazareth, Bethlehem and Lititz.\r\nChristopher Dock, “the pious schoolmaster of the Skippack,” taught a\r\nMoravian school in Germantown, and is the author of the first book on\r\nschool teaching published in America.\r\n\r\nDuring the sixty years following the establishment of Keith’s school\r\nthere was no attempt made to start schools that would be free to all and\r\nnot marked by the distinction between the rich and poor children. This\r\ndemocratic principle was not clearly formulated and advanced until it\r\nwas taken up by Benjamin Franklin in 1749, when he distributed gratis a\r\npamphlet which soon became productive of important results in the\r\nestablishment of the future University of Pennsylvania. Prior to that\r\ntime most of the schools in the province were conducted either under\r\nstrictly private auspices or under the patronage of religious\r\ndenominations.\r\n\r\nMarch 1, 1802, Governor Thomas McKean signed the first law for the\r\neducation of the children of the poor gratis, although both the\r\nConstitution of 1776 and that of 1790 provided for the establishment of\r\n“a school or schools in every county.” Owing to the lameness of this\r\nlaw, it remained a dead statute so far as some of the counties of the\r\nState were concerned.\r\n\r\nThe City and County of Philadelphia had been erected into “the first\r\nschool district of Pennsylvania” in 1818, and in 1822 the City and\r\nCounty of Lancaster were erected into “the second school district.”\r\nThese, termed the Lancasterian methods, were the beginnings of that\r\nglorious system of free education which has been a blessing to our great\r\nCommonwealth.\r\n\r\nUp to 1830, the great free-school system, as we now have it, was still\r\nin embryo. The people began to awaken; public meetings were held all\r\nover the State, resolutions were adopted, comparisons with other States\r\nwere made. The result was that on March 15, 1834, “An Act to Establish a\r\nGeneral System of Education by Common Schools” was passed. Only a single\r\nmember of the House and three Senators voted nay.\r\n\r\nLate in 1834 the enemies of free schools attacked the measure all over\r\nthe State, and the Senate voted to repeal the act of 1834, but Thaddeus\r\nStevens saved the measure in the House. By 1848 this school law had\r\ngrown much in favor, but it was not until 1874 that the last district in\r\nthe State accepted the law. State Superintendent Wickersham then said in\r\nhis annual report: “For the first time in our history the door of a\r\npublic school house stands open to receive every child of proper age\r\nwithin the limits of the State.”\r\n\r\nThe progress of education after 1850 was very rapid. The crowning acts\r\nto make elementary education universal were the free textbook law of\r\n1893 and the compulsory attendance law of 1895.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Pennsylvania on Paper Money Basis When\r\n                       Bills of Credit Are Issued\r\n                            March 2, 1722–23\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first bills of credit, or paper-money, issued in the English\r\nAmerican colonies were put forth by Massachusetts, in 1690, to pay the\r\ntroops who went on an expedition against Quebec, under Sir William\r\nPhipps.\r\n\r\nIt was Governor Sir William Keith who first introduced the people of\r\nPennsylvania to the pleasures and benefits of an irredeemable paper\r\ncurrency.\r\n\r\nThere had been great and long-standing complaint about the deficiency of\r\na circulating medium, for the use of wampum had ceased, and foreign coin\r\nhad never become plenty. The course of exchange ran heavily against the\r\nProvince, and those who possessed money made enormous profits by the\r\npurchase and sale of bills.\r\n\r\nThe merchants of England did not ship bank-notes or coin to the\r\nProvinces. They paid for the produce which they purchased here with\r\nEnglish goods, and settled the balances by shipments of sugar, rum,\r\netc., from Barbadoes and other places in the West Indies, and by Negroes\r\nand indentured servants.\r\n\r\nThere seems to have been more hard money in Philadelphia than in New\r\nEngland, for Franklin, a paper-money man, notes in his autobiography how\r\nhis fellow-workmen in Boston were surprised when he returned to his\r\nbrother’s place in 1724 from Philadelphia. Franklin displayed a handful\r\nof silver, which was a rare sight, for they only had paper-money in\r\nBoston.\r\n\r\nWhen Franklin first visited Philadelphia, in 1723, he noticed with\r\nsurprise the free circulation of metallic money among the people of\r\nPennsylvania. The whole of his own money then consisted of a Dutch\r\ndollar and a shilling’s worth of coppers.\r\n\r\nBut this condition soon changed for James Logan, in writing to the\r\nProprietaries late in 1724, says, “No gold or silver passes amongst us.”\r\n\r\nThe Proprietary demanded sterling money in payment of quit-rents, no\r\nmatter what the depreciation of the provincial currency. This was their\r\nright since they had nothing to do either with the emission of the\r\ncurrency or its depreciation.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1729 Logan wrote, “I dare not speak one word against it. The\r\npopular phrenzy will never stop till their credit will be as bad as they\r\nare in New England, where an ounce of silver is worth twenty shillings\r\nof this paper. They already talk of making more, and no man dares appear\r\nto stem the fury of popular rage.” Logan at that early date thought the\r\nking should arrest the delusion by proclamation.\r\n\r\nThe peltries, grain, flour, ships, cooper-stuff, and lumber of\r\nPhiladelphia were always good for hard money with a good mercantile\r\nsystem. But the people were not satisfied.\r\n\r\nIt is quite likely that wages and small debts were paid almost entirely\r\nin the way of barter instead of money, and this, by the losses it\r\noccasioned produced discontent. The capitalists opposed a change in the\r\ncurrency, the farmers, laborers, and small trades people favored it.\r\n\r\nIn the language of petitions sent to the Assembly at this time, the\r\nfriends of paper money contended that they were sensibly “aggrieved in\r\ntheir estates and dealings, to the great loss and growing ruin of\r\nthemselves, and the evident decay of the province in general, for want\r\nof a medium to buy and sell with,” and they therefore prayed a paper\r\ncurrency.\r\n\r\nThe people of Chester County, on the other hand, asked to have the value\r\nof the current money of the Province raised, the exportation of money\r\nprohibited, and produce made a legal tender, so as to obviate the\r\nnecessity for paper money. They did not want a regular State issue, but\r\nnevertheless, like men of more modern greenback times, they wanted an\r\ninconvertible paper money, a non-exportable currency, as if that were a\r\nblessing.\r\n\r\nOn March 2, 1722–23 an act was passed to issue £15,000. Governor Keith,\r\nin consenting to and promoting this experimental load, had been\r\nencouraged by the popularity of a similar measure matured by Governor\r\nBurnett of New Jersey.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania was the very last of the middle colonies to embark in the\r\npaper money manufacture; but once embarked, she plunged in rapidly and\r\ndeeply.\r\n\r\nThis first small loan of £15,000 was to be redeemed within eight years.\r\nIn 1723 £30,000 was issued; in 1740 the issue reached a total of\r\n£80,000.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Franklin, who had urged and used his personal influence for\r\nthis currency became alarmed and wrote, “I now think there are limits\r\nbeyond which the quantity may be hurtful.” He was right.\r\n\r\nIn 1755 Pennsylvania had £160,000 currency out; and in 1783 the State’s\r\nirredeemable currency had been increased by various issues until it\r\nreached $4,325,000, a sum simply ruinous to all values.\r\n\r\nThe general plan of these loans was good. No bills were loaned but on\r\ngood security. The friends of the system were many.\r\n\r\nPaper money was also issued at times by individuals. In May, 1746,\r\nJoseph Gray gave notice that Franklin had printed for him £27,100 in\r\nnotes of hand of 2 d., 3 d., and 6 d., “out of sheer necessity for want\r\nof pence for running change. Whoever takes them shall have them\r\nexchanged on demand with the best money I have.”\r\n\r\nIn 1749 the scarcity of small change was so great that the inhabitants\r\npetitioned for relief, and a committee of the Assembly was appointed to\r\nbring in a bill for the issue of £20,000, mostly in small bills.\r\n\r\nAn association was formed for issuing paper money to relieve the\r\npressure for change. Eight reputable merchants issued five-pound notes\r\nto the amount of £20,000, payable at nine months with five per cent\r\ninterest. It was soon evident that anyone might do the same thing, and\r\nthe community be flooded with valueless currency. It was also at the\r\nsame time a new way of borrowing capital. A petition signed by two\r\nhundred tradesmen was presented to the Assembly, which forbade it.\r\n\r\nIn 1763 the whole paper-money system of the colonies, including that of\r\nPennsylvania, was outlawed by act of Parliament, when Franklin wrote a\r\npamphlet, protesting against the act.\r\n\r\nThis outlawing of colonial money had much to do with prejudicing the\r\npeople of the colonies against the rule of Parliament.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                General Clark Began Draft for Troops in\r\n\r\nDrive Against Detroit, March 3, 1781\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Western frontiers of Pennsylvania were sorely distressed during the\r\nspring and summer of 1781 by the efforts of General George Rogers Clark,\r\nan officer of the Dominion of Virginia, to raise troops for an\r\nexpedition in the interest of Virginia against the British post at\r\nDetroit.\r\n\r\nClark received a commission as brigadier general and was given ample\r\nfunds with which to purchase provisions in the country west of the\r\nAllegheny Mountains. Also a small force of 140 Virginia regulars was\r\nplaced at his service and he was empowered to equip additional\r\nvolunteers in the border counties.\r\n\r\nAgents were sent in advance of General Clark into the country between\r\nthe Laurel Hill range and the Ohio River, who began to buy flour and\r\nlive cattle. This caused much uneasiness among the Pennsylvania\r\nmilitiamen stationed in that country, and Colonel Daniel Brodhead made\r\ncomplaint to the State Government.\r\n\r\nColonel Brodhead received a letter from General Washington directing him\r\nto give aid to General Clark’s undertaking and to detach from his own\r\nforce the field artillery under command of Captain Isaac Craig, and at\r\nleast a captain’s command of infantry, to assist the Virginia\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\nGeneral Clark arrived on the Pennsylvania frontier March 3 and\r\nestablished his headquarters at the house of Colonel William Crawford,\r\non the Youghiogheny, spending part of his time with Colonel Dorsey\r\nPentecost on Chartiers Creek.\r\n\r\nIt was generally known by this time that all of Virginia county of\r\nYohogania and much of the counties of Monongahela and Ohio, claimed as\r\npart of Virginia, really belonged to Pennsylvania, but the actual\r\nboundary line had not been surveyed west of the Monongahela River.\r\n\r\nAmong the settlers there were many factions, some who would only obey\r\nthe laws of Pennsylvania, and who declared that Clark was a Virginia\r\nofficer and had no business in Pennsylvania; others adhered to Virginia\r\nauthority until the line should be permanently settled. A few took\r\nadvantage of the situation and refused to obey either government saying\r\nthey did not know which had authority over them, and they had enough to\r\ndo to plant and keep their rifles in readiness for the savages.\r\n\r\nClark intended to raise a force of 2,000 men. When he arrived at Colonel\r\nCrawford’s he learned that the frontiers were being raided by bands of\r\nShawnee from the Scioto, Delaware from the Muskingum and Wyandot from\r\nthe Sandusky.\r\n\r\nAn expedition against those tribes would be more popular among the\r\nWestern Pennsylvanians than a campaign against distant Detroit, and\r\nClark very adroitly made an ostensible change in his plans. He gave it\r\nout that he was going against the Ohio savages, for the immediate\r\nbenefit of the Westmoreland frontier, but his real design to conquer\r\nDetroit was not altered.\r\n\r\nColonel Brodhead was not for one moment deceived by General Clark, but\r\nmany Pennsylvania officials were. On March 23 Clark wrote to President\r\nReed, of Pennsylvania, asking his indorsement of the enterprise, for the\r\neffect it might have on the frontiersmen who called themselves\r\nPennsylvanians.\r\n\r\nColonel Christopher Hays, the Westmoreland County member of the Supreme\r\nExecutive Council, was directed to aid Clark’s expedition, but he was at\r\nheart opposed to it.\r\n\r\nColonel Hays called a meeting of all the commissioned officers of the\r\nWestmoreland militia to arrange a plan for the frontier defense. The\r\nofficers met June 18, at the home of Captain John McClelland, on Big\r\nSewickley Creek, and, much to the chagrin of Colonel Hays, decided by a\r\nmajority vote to give aid to General Clark. It was resolved to furnish\r\n300 men out of the county militia to join Clark’s army and Colonel\r\nLochry was directed to see that this quota was raised by “volunteer or\r\ndraft.”\r\n\r\nThis was the initial effort on the Pennsylvania frontier to raise\r\nsoldiers by draft and it caused an outcry.\r\n\r\nSuch prominent citizens as Colonel Pentecost, John Canon, Gabriel Cox\r\nand Daniel Leet worked zealously to recruit men for General Clark, while\r\ncounty lieutenant Marshel and his adherents were just as active to\r\ndefeat the Virginian project. This rivalry, which grew exceedingly\r\nbitter, was fatal to Clark’s enterprise.\r\n\r\nFew assembled at the general rendezvous, and Clark began to draft men\r\nfor his army. This afforded the rougher element among the Virginians an\r\nopportunity to exploit their hatred toward Pennsylvanians. The draft\r\nproceeded amid pillage, cruelty and personal violence. Virginian raiding\r\nparties scoured the country, seizing and beating men, frightening and\r\nabusing women, breaking into houses and barns and causing a general\r\nreign of terror.\r\n\r\nCaptain John Hardin was most vigorous in denouncing the Virginia\r\nproceedings and advising against the draft. He owned a grist mill near\r\nRedstone. His eldest son, John, was a lieutenant in the Eighth\r\nPennsylvania, afterward famous as General John Hardin, of Kentucky.\r\n\r\nAt the head of forty horsemen General Clark visited Hardin’s settlement\r\nand announced his purpose of hanging the stubborn old pioneer. Hardin\r\ncould not be found, but one of his sons was caught and kept bound for\r\nseveral days. They broke open the mill, fed the grain to their horses,\r\noccupied his dwelling, killed his sheep and hogs for food and feasted\r\nthere several days.\r\n\r\nGeneral Clark declared Hardin’s estate forfeited for treason. The\r\ngeneral threatened to hang those opposed to the draft, but none were\r\nhanged.\r\n\r\nOn August 8, Clark began the descent of the Ohio with a force of 400,\r\nbut with his spirit broken. The evening of the day he left Colonel\r\nArchibald Lochry arrived with 100 volunteers from Westmoreland County.\r\nThese expert riflemen could have been used to advantage by Clark and at\r\nthe same time they would have avoided the disaster which befell Lochry\r\nduring his effort to join Clark.\r\n\r\nMost of Clark’s force deserted him before he reached Louisville, so that\r\nhe could not venture upon his march into the enemy’s country. He soon\r\nreturned with small detachments, who dispersed to their homes in\r\nVirginia and Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             William Penn Received Charter for Pennsylvania\r\n\r\nfrom King, March 4, 1681\r\n\r\n\r\nAdmiral Sir William Penn, renowned in English history by his martial\r\nvalor as an officer of the British Navy, left to his son a claim against\r\nthe Government for £16,000, consisting to a great extent of money\r\nadvanced by him in the sea service and of arrearages in his pay.\r\n\r\nSir William Penn was in command of an English warship at the age of\r\ntwenty-three, when sent to the coast of Ireland to help fight the battle\r\nof Parliament against Charles the First.\r\n\r\nWhen the war with the Dutch followed—caused by the seizure of New\r\nNetherlands—Admiral Penn commanded the English fleet, under the Duke of\r\nYork, in a fierce naval engagement off the east coast of England at\r\nLowestoft, in June, 1665. Just before this battle the admiral’s son,\r\nWilliam Penn, Jr., was sent to the King with dispatches.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Penn died in 1670, worn out at forty-nine, and his son succeeded\r\nto his estates.\r\n\r\nIn 1680 William Penn petitioned Charles II to grant him, in lieu of the\r\nsum due to his father’s estate, letter-patent, “for a tract of land in\r\nAmerica, lying north of Maryland, on the east bounded with the Delaware\r\nRiver, on the west limited as Maryland, and northward to extend as far\r\nas plantable.”\r\n\r\nKing Charles II was at once willing to grant the petition of William\r\nPenn because he could thus pay the debt owed Sir William. Some of his\r\ncounselors objected, saying, that it would be ridiculous to suppose that\r\nthe interests of the British nation were to be promoted by sending a\r\ncolony of people that would not fight, that would have nothing to do\r\nwith gin and gunpowder in dealing with the Indians. But the young Quaker\r\nstood high in the favor of the Duke of York, and of Charles II, and the\r\nKing gladly consented to this easy mode of discharging the obligation.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of York desired to retain the three lower counties, or the\r\npresent State of Delaware, as an appendage to New York, but his\r\nobjections were finally withdrawn, as were those of Lord Baltimore.\r\n\r\nAfter sundry conferences and discussions concerning the boundary lines\r\nand other matters of minor importance, the committee finally sent in a\r\nfavorable recommendation and presented a draft of charter, constituting\r\nWilliam Penn, Esq., absolute Proprietary of a tract of land in America,\r\ntherein mentioned, to the King for his approbation; and leaving to him\r\nalso the naming of the Province.\r\n\r\nThe King affixed his signature on March 4, 1681. The original charter is\r\nin the State Library. It is written on three pieces of strong parchment,\r\nin old English handwriting, with each line underscored with lines of red\r\nink. The borders are gorgeously decorated with heraldic devices, and the\r\ntop of the first page exhibits a finely executed likeness of His\r\nMajesty, in good preservation.\r\n\r\nPenn wished his province to be called New Wales, but the King insisted\r\non Pennsylvania. Penn next proposed Sylvania, on the ground that the\r\nprefix “Penn” would appear like a vanity on his part, and not as a mark\r\nof respect for his father; but no amendment was accepted.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the province was three degrees of latitude by five degrees\r\nof longitude, the eastern boundary being the Delaware River, the\r\nnorthern boundary “the beginning of the three and fortieth degree of\r\nnorthern latitude, and on the south a circle drawn at twelve miles\r\ndistant from New Castle, northward and westward into the beginning of\r\nthe fortieth degree of northern latitude, and then by a straight line\r\nwestward to the limits of longitude above mentioned.” The three lower\r\ncounties on the Delaware were not included in the charter.\r\n\r\nThe charter gave title to more than 45,000 square miles of land, and was\r\namong the largest tracts in America ever granted to a single individual.\r\nThis grant gave Penn no coast line for his colony; so, August 2, 1682,\r\nhe purchased from the Duke of York the “Three Counties Upon the\r\nDelaware,” which now form the State of Delaware. Although these were\r\nseparated from Pennsylvania in 1702, they remained a part of the domain\r\nof the Penn family until the American Revolution.\r\n\r\nThree things moved Penn to plant a colony in the New World; first, he\r\nwould get payment for the amount of £16,000 due his father; secondly, he\r\nwould find a place for his brethren, the Quakers, or Friends, where they\r\nwould not be openly insulted in the streets, or dragged from their\r\nmeeting houses to loathsome jails and robbed of the last bed or cow to\r\npay the fines for not attending the established church; and thirdly, he\r\nwould satisfy the desire which the glowing accounts of the brethren in\r\nthe present New Jersey had created in him.\r\n\r\nThe second of these motives was by far the strongest. Penn himself had\r\nbeen tried for preaching to “an unlawful, seditious and riotous\r\nassembly.” Penn and his people enjoyed neither religious nor civil\r\nliberty in England.\r\n\r\nThe charter to Penn sets forth three objects; a desire on the part of\r\nPenn to enlarge the English empire; to promote trade; and to bring the\r\nsavage natives by gentleness and justice to the love of civil society\r\nand the Christian religion.\r\n\r\nBesides the territory granted, the charter gave Penn the power to make\r\nlaws, set up courts, to trade, to erect towns, to collect customs\r\nduties; to make war, to sell lands and to impose taxes.\r\n\r\nCopies of all laws were to be sent to England, and if disapproved within\r\nsix months they became void. No war was to be made upon any State at\r\npeace with England. Any twenty of the people could request the Bishop of\r\nLondon to send them a preacher of the Church of England, who was to\r\nreside within the province without being molested.\r\n\r\nPenn offered attractive concessions to the settlers. Land was sold to\r\nthem at the rate of $10 for 100 acres and every purchaser of lands\r\nshould have a lot in the city, to be laid out along the river. In\r\nclearing the ground care was to be taken “to leave one acre of trees for\r\nevery five acres cleared.” This was the beginning of forestry in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the charter the present limits of the State were\r\ninhabited by the Indians, with some Swedes and Dutch settled along the\r\nDelaware.\r\n\r\nThe first real settlement under the new proprietor was made in 1681,\r\nwhen Penn sent William Markham, his cousin, to take possession of the\r\nprovince. The next year Penn himself arrived, bringing in his ship, the\r\nWelcome, a hundred colonists of his own faith, to found Philadelphia,\r\nthe city of “Brotherly Love.”\r\n\r\nPenn bought the land from the Indians, making a treaty of peace with\r\nthem which remained unbroken for more than fifty years. “We shall never\r\nforget the counsel he gave us,” said an Indian chief at Conestoga in\r\n1721.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Colonel Daniel Brodhead Arrives at Fort Pitt\r\n                    to Fight Indians, March 5, 1779\r\n\r\n\r\nColonel Daniel Brodhead was sent to Fort Pitt to relieve General Edward\r\nHand, and he arrived there March 5, 1779. He was a trained soldier and\r\nknew how to fight Indians.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hand turned over to him seven hundred militiamen. Some of these\r\nwere stationed at Fort McIntosh, at what is now Beaver, some at Fort\r\nHenry, now Wheeling, W. Va., a few at Fort Randolph, now Point Pleasant,\r\ndetails at Fort Hand, near Kiskimimetas, near Apollo, and another guard\r\nat Fort Crawford, now Parnassus.\r\n\r\nForts Hand and Crawford were intended to protect the northern border of\r\nWestmoreland County from the raids of the Iroquois who lived on the\r\nupper waters of the Allegheny River.\r\n\r\nWith the first mild weather of spring the incursions of the savages\r\nbegan. The Seneca and Munsee descended the Allegheny in canoes and\r\nscattered in little bands throughout the country. They burned cabins,\r\nkilled and scalped men, carried off the women and children and household\r\ngoods.\r\n\r\nColonel Brodhead put into operation a system of scouting along the\r\nborder from one fort to another. From his regulars at Fort Pitt, he\r\nselected his boldest and most experienced frontiersmen and organized\r\nranging parties and sent them on extended tours through the forests. To\r\nthe command of these important details he selected three of the bravest\r\nwoodsmen in the Eighth Pennsylvania, Captain Van Swearingen, Lieutenant\r\nSamuel Brady and Lieutenant John Hardin. It was in this service that\r\nBrady won his fame as an Indian fighter.\r\n\r\nSamuel Brady’s hatred of the savages was personal and he made it his\r\nbusiness to kill them. In this he was justified in the cruel death of\r\nhis brother, James, August 8, 1778, which was followed by the\r\ntreacherous murder of his father, the celebrated Captain John Brady,\r\nApril 11, 1779.\r\n\r\nSamuel Brady received the news of his father’s death about the time he\r\nwas chosen by Colonel Brodhead to the command of forest rangers. This\r\nincreased his hatred of the red men and moved him to execute vengeance.\r\n\r\nBrady and his scouts were clad entirely in Indian fashion. In the forest\r\nexcursions they even painted their bodies and faces and wore feathers in\r\ntheir hair, in imitation of savage warriors.\r\n\r\nAn attack was made on Ligonier settlement in April. On April 26, one\r\nhundred Indians and Tories attacked Fort Hand, in both affairs defenders\r\nwere killed and many captured, and other places were attacked and\r\nhabitations burned.\r\n\r\nDuring May, Brodhead kept his scouts out along the upper Allegheny to\r\ngive warning of the approach of hostile bands.\r\n\r\nBrodhead learned, about June 1, that a large band of Seneca and Tories,\r\nunder Colonel John Butler was preparing to descend the Allegheny, and he\r\ndispatched three scouts, in canoes as far as Venango, the present\r\nFranklin. The scouts were discovered and pursued, and narrowly escaped\r\ncapture, but brought the news which confirmed the report received by\r\nBrodhead.\r\n\r\nThe savages penetrated into Westmoreland, where they killed and scalped\r\na solitary soldier, then attacked the little settlement at James Perry’s\r\nMills, on Big Sewickley Creek, killed a woman and four children, and\r\ncarried off two children, many cattle and much plunder.\r\n\r\nTwo ranging parties were sent after these marauders. One was marched to\r\nthe Sewickley settlement and an attempt was made to follow the trail.\r\nThe other band consisted of twenty men under Brady, which ascended the\r\nAllegheny River.\r\n\r\nAs Brady’s detail advanced one evening along the beach within the mouth\r\nof the Big Mahoning where it empties into the Allegheny, they found many\r\nIndian canoes drawn up and hidden among the shrubbery. The Indians had\r\ngone into camp in the woods, on a little knoll north of the creek, and\r\nwere preparing the evening meal when discovered by Brady. They had\r\nhobbled their horses and turned them out to graze. The stream was very\r\nhigh and the scouts were compelled to ascend it two miles before they\r\ncould wade across.\r\n\r\nAfter nightfall Brady and his men hid themselves in the tall grass near\r\nthe Indian camp. Brady and Chief Nonowland, laying aside their\r\ntomahawks, knives, powder horns and bullet pouches, crept to within a\r\nfew yards of the Indian camp to count the savages and ascertain the\r\nposition of the captive children.\r\n\r\nOne of the Indians suddenly cast off his blanket, arose, stepped forth\r\nto within six feet of where Brady lay, stood there awhile, stretched\r\nhimself and then returned to his slumber.\r\n\r\nBrady and Nonowland then prepared for an attack at daybreak. The whole\r\nparty of scouts made their way through the grass and weeds to a position\r\nas near the camp as was considered safe, and lay awaiting the dawn.\r\n\r\nAs daylight appeared an Indian awoke and aroused the others. They stood\r\nabout the fire laughing and chatting when a deadly volley broke forth\r\nfrom the rifles of the scouts lying in the bushes. The chief and seven\r\nIndian warriors fell dead and the others, almost naked, fled into the\r\ndense forest, two of them severely wounded. Brady’s own rifle brought\r\ndown the chief, and with a shout of almost fiendish triumph he sprang\r\nforward and scalped him.\r\n\r\nThe traditions of the Brady family say that the chief was none other\r\nthan Bald Eagle, who had struck down and scalped Brady’s younger\r\nbrother, James, ten months before. Brodhead reported to Washington that\r\nthe chief was “a notorious warrior of the Munsee nation.”\r\n\r\nThe children captured at Sewickley were recovered unharmed and Brady and\r\nhis men returned to Fort Pitt with the stolen horses and plunder, the\r\nblankets, guns, tomahawks and knives of the savages and many scalps.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Settlers Attack Pack Trains Near Fort\r\n                         Loudoun, March 6, 1765\r\n\r\n\r\nThe period immediately following Colonel Bouquet’s successful expedition\r\nagainst the Indians at Muskingum October, 1764, was one of comparative\r\npeace, but this did not long continue.\r\n\r\nA most interesting episode occurred about this time in the Conococheague\r\nValley, from the North to the South Mountain. The people who had been\r\ndriven off had gradually returned and were now determined to make a\r\nbetter stand against the enemy. They raised a sum of money and recruited\r\na company of riflemen, of which James Smith was elected captain. They\r\ndressed in Indian fashion and painted their faces red and black like the\r\nIndian warriors.\r\n\r\nTwo of the officers had long been in Indian captivity, and they drilled\r\ntheir men in Indian discipline, and so expert did this company become\r\nthat it was recognized by the British Government and Captain Smith\r\nreceived a commission in the regular service under King George III, and\r\nthe following year was with Bouquet’s expedition against Muskingum.\r\n\r\nGeorge Croghan, the deputy agent for Indian affairs, went to Fort Pitt\r\nin February, 1765, and brought about the meeting with Sir William\r\nJohnson, whereby on May 8, 1765, a definite treaty of peace was made\r\nwith the Delaware.\r\n\r\nWhen Croghan set out from Philadelphia for Fort Pitt, March 1, 1765, he\r\ngave a pass for a large number of wagons belonging to Boynton and\r\nWharton, of Philadelphia, loaded with merchandise, which was intended as\r\npresents for the Indians at Fort Pitt.\r\n\r\nBut the people of Cumberland County took the law into their own hands to\r\nprevent warlike stores being supplied to savages recently in arms\r\nagainst them. These goods were hauled to Henry Collins, at\r\nConococheague, and there he contracted to pack them on eighty-one\r\nhorses, by which they were to be delivered into Fort Pitt.\r\n\r\nThis large transaction alarmed the country and William Duffield raised\r\nand armed about fifty of the trained men of that valley and marched to\r\nFort Loudoun, where Duffield made a request that this consignment of\r\ngoods be stored up until further orders, but this was refused, and on\r\nMarch 6 the pack train proceeded on its journey.\r\n\r\nThe same morning a large company started from the house of William\r\nSmith, one of the Justices of Cumberland County. They came up with this\r\npack train at Sideling Hill, about seventeen miles beyond Fort Loudoun,\r\nwhen sixty-three of the horse loads were burned or pillaged.\r\n\r\nA sergeant and twelve men of the Highlanders sent from the fort, went\r\nthrough the neighborhood, saved the balance of the goods, captured\r\nseveral persons, five rifles and four smooth bore guns.\r\n\r\nThe traders, after losing their caravan, went back to the fort and\r\ncomplained to the commanding officer. It was then that three hundred\r\nriflemen marched to Fort Loudoun and encamped on the hill in sight of\r\nthe fort.\r\n\r\nJames Smith, a relative of Justice Smith, and the captain who served\r\nwith Bouquet, appeared in a few days at the head of a large crowd of his\r\ninfuriated neighbors, and declared that they would suffer death to the\r\nlast man, rather than let the prisoners be put to jail at Carlisle.\r\n\r\nTwo months later another caravan of horses laden with liquors, etc., for\r\nthe troops at Fort Pitt, under a pass from the commander there, arrived\r\nat Fort Loudoun, about May 1, and were relieved of their burden in the\r\nfort. The drivers led their horses out to pasture, when about thirty\r\nmen, with their faces painted black, rushed upon them, flogged the\r\ndrivers, killed five horses and burned all the saddles. In the battle\r\nwhich ensued one of the attacking party was wounded.\r\n\r\nAgain Captain James Smith led his neighbors to the fort. He was\r\naccompanied by three Justices who demanded right to search the goods in\r\nstore there, but intended for transportation to Fort Pitt.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Charles Grant, of the Highlanders, commandant of the fort,\r\nexplained that the general had committed the goods to his care, but had\r\nordered an inventory to be taken before a justice of the peace, but this\r\ninventory could not be taken in the presence of a mob.\r\n\r\nThe vigilance men threw off the restraints of decent appearance by\r\nissuing the following:\r\n\r\n“Advertisement. These are to give notice to all our Loyal Volunteers to\r\nthose that has not yet inlisted, you are to come to our Town and come to\r\nour Tavern and fill your Belly’s with Liquor and your mouth with\r\nswearing, and you will have your pass, but if not, your Back must be\r\nwhipt and mouth gagged. * * * We will have Grant, the officer of\r\nLoudoun, whip’d or hanged. * * * The Governor will pardon our Crimes,\r\nand the Clergy will give-us absolution, and the Country will stand by\r\nus; so we may do what we please. * * * free toleration for drinking,\r\nswearing, sabbath breaking, and any outrage what we have a mind to, to\r\nlet those Strangers know their place. * * * We call it Hell’s town, in\r\nCumberland County, the 25th May, 1765. Peter’s Township.”\r\n\r\nThe crowning deed was reserved for May 28. Lieutenant Grant, while\r\nriding about a mile from the fort, was fired upon. His horse started\r\nsuddenly at the crack of the rifle and he was thrown off. Captain James\r\nSmith and others seized him, carried him six miles distant and kept him\r\na prisoner all night in the woods. He was there threatened unless he\r\nagreed to give up all the arms taken from the rioters.\r\n\r\nGovernor Penn and General Gage were humiliated by these insults to the\r\nKing’s uniform and their inability to punish the offenders, but the more\r\nserious concern was in the obstruction of the communication for traders\r\nwith their goods to reach the Illinois country, where the French across\r\nthe Mississippi, were ready to obtain an influence by commerce.\r\n\r\nWhile allegiance of the Indians was thus jeopardized, white men began to\r\ncreep over the mountains and encroach upon land not yet sold by the\r\naborigines. Red Stone settlement was thus made, at the risk of another\r\nwar. Gage sent a detachment of Highlanders to this region to compel all\r\nwhites west of the Alleghenies to return to their own provinces, but\r\nthose who left soon went back again with others.\r\n\r\nOn June 4, 1765, Governor Penn declared trade with the Indians open from\r\nJune 20 to all inhabitants of the Province who should apply for and\r\nobtain his license.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Andrew Lycans Killed in Attack by Indians\r\n                   in Wiconisco Valley, March 7,1756\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wiconisco or Lykens Valley includes that section of the “Upper End”\r\nof Dauphin County that is watered by the Wiconisco Creek and its\r\nbranches, save where local names have been given to certain portions,\r\nsuch as Williams Valley, etc.\r\n\r\nIn 1732 Andrew Lycans settled on the Swartara Creek, where he took up\r\n250 acres of land. In 1740 he removed to the west side of the\r\nSusquehanna, where he settled between Sherman’s Creek and the Juniata,\r\nin then Cumberland County.\r\n\r\nThis land had not been included in the last Indian purchase and the\r\nShawnee Indians, who had a few scattered villages on the Juniata,\r\ncomplained of the encroachments of these settlers and demanded their\r\nremoval. To pacify the Indians the provincial authorities sent, in 1748,\r\nthe Sheriff of Lancaster County, with three magistrates, accompanied by\r\nConrad Weiser, to warn the people to leave at once, but they remained,\r\ndetermined not to be driven away, at least by threats.\r\n\r\nOn May 22, 1750, a number of high dignitaries appointed by the\r\nLieutenant Governor, held a conference at the house of George Croghan,\r\nin Pennsborough Township, Cumberland County. Subsequently, accompanied\r\nby Deputy Sheriff Andrew Work, of that county, they went to the place\r\nwhere Andrew Lycans and his neighbors lived, took them all into custody\r\nand burned their cabins.\r\n\r\nSheriff Work presented his account for the “removal of trespassers at\r\nJuniata,” in which he asked for ten days’ pay for his “attendance on the\r\nSecretary Magistrates of the County of Cumberland, by his Hon’s. the\r\nGovernor’s command to remove sundry persons settled to the northward of\r\nthe Kickitania Mountains.” This and the expenses of a messenger sent\r\nfrom Lancaster amounted to three pounds and seven shillings. Then he\r\nasked for “the Under-Sheriff’s attendance in taking down Andrew Lycan to\r\nprison to Lancaster; other expenses on the journey; two pounds ten\r\nshillings.”\r\n\r\nLycans and his neighbors were subsequently released by order of Governor\r\nHamilton. Andrew Lycans removed with his family to the east side of the\r\nSusquehanna, beyond the Kittochtinny Mountains, and by permission of the\r\nauthorities “settled on a tract of about 200 acres situated on the\r\nnortherly side of Whiconesong Creek.” Here he made extensive\r\nimprovements.\r\n\r\nUntil the spring of 1756 these pioneers were not disturbed, but\r\nfollowing the defeat of General Braddock, everywhere along the frontier\r\nthe savages began their work of devastation and death.\r\n\r\nOn March 7, 1756, Andrew Lycans and John Rewalt went out early to feed\r\ntheir cattle, when they were suddenly startled by the report of two\r\nrifles. Neither of them being harmed, they were able to reach the house,\r\nwhere they prepared themselves for defense in case of an attack.\r\n\r\nThe Indians concealed themselves behind a hog-house not far from the\r\ndwelling. John Lycans, a son of Andrew; John Rewalt and Ludwig Shutt, a\r\nneighbor, crept out of the house in an effort to discover the\r\nwhereabouts of the savages and get a shot at them, but they were fired\r\nupon by five Indians and each one wounded, Shutt receiving a dangerous\r\nwound in the abdomen.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Andrew Lycans discovered one of the Indians named Joshua\r\nJames near the hog-house and also two white men running away from their\r\nhiding place. Lycans fired and killed James.\r\n\r\nLycans and his party in the house believed this a favorable opportunity\r\nfor escape and started from the dwelling, but they were observed and\r\nclosely pursued by a score of the enemy.\r\n\r\nJohn Lycans and John Rewalt were too badly wounded to put up much\r\nresistance, but with the aid of a Negro servant they escaped, leaving\r\nAndrew Lycans, Ludwig Shutt and a boy to engage the Indians.\r\n\r\nThe savages rushed in upon them, and one Indian in the act of striking\r\nthe boy with his tomahawk was shot dead by Shutt, while Lycans killed\r\nanother and wounded a third Indian.\r\n\r\nThe Indian killed by Shutt was named Bill Davis. Two others recognized\r\nby Lycans were Tom Hickman and Tom Hayes, all of the Delaware tribe, and\r\nwell known in that neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThis upset in the plan of attack caused the Indians to momentarily cease\r\ntheir pursuit and Lycans, Shutt and the lad, being exhausted from loss\r\nof blood, sat down on a log to rest themselves, believing they were no\r\nlonger in danger. The Indians stood some distance off to keep them in\r\nview, but in spite of this caution, Lycans managed to lead his little\r\nparty to a place of safe concealment and later over the mountain into\r\nHanover Township, where neighbors gave them assistance; but Andrew\r\nLycans died from his injuries and exposure.\r\n\r\nThis pioneer martyr left a wife, one son and five daughters. These\r\nreturned to their home soon as the danger was over, and on more than one\r\nsubsequent occasion were compelled to flee before the marauding savages.\r\nThe one attack in which Andrew Lycans was killed is the only occasion\r\nwhere a life was lost by the Indian incursions in the Wiconisco Valley.\r\n\r\nJohn Lycans, son of Andrew, became an officer in the provincial service,\r\ncommissioned July 12, 1762. In June, 1764, he was stationed at Manada\r\nGap. His mother, Jane Lycans, in February, 1765, had a patent issued to\r\nher for the land on which her husband had located.\r\n\r\nThe original Lycans cabin stood until about fifty years ago. It was\r\nsituated near the present site of Oakdale, a few yards north of the\r\nbridge that crosses the Wiconisco. It was built of hewn logs with\r\nwindows about nine inches square, which were also used as port holes.\r\n\r\nAndrew Lycans has given his name to the beautiful valley of the\r\nWiconisco, owing possibly to his fatal encounter with the Indians, March\r\n7, 1756.\r\n\r\nLudwig Shutt recovered from his serious wounds and lived until 1790, and\r\nleft a large family, some of his descendants being present residents of\r\nLykens Valley. John Rewalt subsequently removed to another part of the\r\nprovince as did John Lycans, following his tour of duty as an officer in\r\nthe provincial service.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Frightful Slaughter of Indians at Gnadenhuetten,\r\n                             March 8, 1782\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1781, Pennsylvania frontiersmen decided that their safety\r\nwould no longer permit the residence of the Moravian Indians on the\r\nMuskingum, which was about seventy miles from Fort McIntosh, in the\r\npresent State of Ohio. Fort McIntosh was on the right bank of the Ohio\r\nRiver at the mouth of Beaver River, now Beaver, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nColonel David Williamson, one of the battalion commanders of Washington\r\nCounty, gathered a company of 100 men and on November 5 started for the\r\nTuscarawa Indians to compel the Moravians either to migrate into the\r\nhostile country or to move in a body to Fort Pitt. They found the\r\nvillage deserted save by a few Indian men and women. Colonel Williamson\r\nconducted these Indians safely to Fort Pitt.\r\n\r\nA small settlement of Delaware had already been established near Fort\r\nPitt. After Colonel Daniel Brodhead destroyed Coshocton, in the spring\r\nof 1781, Killbuck, the chief sachem of the Delaware, with his immediate\r\nkindred and the families of Big Cat, Nonowland and other chiefs, who\r\nremained friends to the American cause took possession of a small island\r\nat the mouth of the Allegheny River, opposite Fort Pitt, where they\r\nbuilt bark wigwams, planted corn and vegetables and otherwise supported\r\nthemselves by hunting and the sale of furs. This place became known as\r\nKillbuck Island, afterwards Smoky Island.\r\n\r\nMany of this settlement accompanied military scouting parties, and were\r\nof much service in the defense of the Western frontier. Chief Killbuck,\r\nalso known as Gelemend, meaning “leader,” became a soldier and officer\r\nin the United States Army. He died in 1811.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1782, which was unusually early, came the marauding\r\nIndians. The first blow fell February 8, when John Fink was killed near\r\nBuchanan’s Fort, on the upper Monongahela. On Sunday, February 10, a\r\nlarge body of Indians visited the dwelling of Robert Wallace, on Raccoon\r\nCreek, Beaver County. The head of the family being absent at the time,\r\nthe savages killed all his cattle and hogs, plundered the house of its\r\ncontents and carried away Mrs. Wallace and her three children.\r\n\r\nAbout February 15, six Indians captured John Carpenter and two of his\r\nhorses on the Dutch Fork, of Buffalo Creek. They crossed the Ohio at\r\nMingo Bottom and made off toward the Tuscarawa villages. Four of these\r\nIndians were Wyandot. Two spoke Dutch, and told Carpenter they were\r\nMoravians. On the morning of the second day, Carpenter was sent to the\r\nwoods to get the horses. Finding them some distance from the camp fire,\r\nhe mounted one of the horses and dashed for Fort Pitt, where he told his\r\nstory to Colonel Gibson.\r\n\r\nGibson mustered 160 young men of Washington County, and placed Colonel\r\nWilliamson in command of the expedition, which moved immediately. The\r\nOhio was at flood height and they effected a crossing Monday, March 4,\r\nand hastened along the beaten trail toward Gnadenhuetten on the\r\nMuskingum. As may well be imagined Robert Wallace was an eager volunteer\r\nin this expedition.\r\n\r\nThey had not proceeded far until they found the torn corpse of Mrs.\r\nWallace, impaled on the trunk of a sapling, just off the path. The\r\nmutilated body of her infant lay nearby. The infuriated frontiersmen\r\nremounted their horses, reached the environs of Gnadenhuetten in the\r\nevening of March 6, when their scouts brought back word that the village\r\nwas now full of Indians.\r\n\r\nColonel Williamson divided his force into three parties, sending one\r\ncommand to strike the river below the town, a second to cross the stream\r\nabove and cut off retreat in that direction, the third forming the\r\ncenter to advance upon the place directly.\r\n\r\nThe attack was begun on the morning of March 7, and not a shot was fired\r\nby the center or left. The presence of women and children warned the\r\nfrontiersmen that it was not occupied simply by a war party, and Colonel\r\nWilliamson quickly learned the Indians were Moravians. No resistance was\r\nmade and soon the frontiersmen were conversing with the Indians who\r\ncould speak English. In a council the colonel told them they must go to\r\nFort Pitt, which the Indians appeared willing to do. The Indians sent\r\nmessengers down the river to Salem to tell their people to come to\r\nGnadenhuetten.\r\n\r\nThe right wing had a more thrilling experience when they found the\r\nTuscarawas was in flood and too swift for their horses to swim. A young\r\nman named Sloughter swam across to get a canoe, which proved to be a\r\nmaple sugar trough, but he paddled it across the swollen stream. The\r\nothers stripped, placed their clothing and rifles in the trough, swam\r\nacross, pushing the trough before them.\r\n\r\nAdvancing down the western shore, a solitary Indian was shot and wounded\r\nin the arm. This act was witnessed by another Indian named Jacob, who\r\nsought escape in a canoe, but was killed.\r\n\r\nThe company advancing upon the Indians working in the corn field, found\r\nthem to be Moravians and led them to the village. Soon the Indians from\r\nSalem arrived to the number of 96, all of whom were confined in a log\r\nchurch, after being disarmed.\r\n\r\nAn Indian woman was found to be wearing the dress of Mrs. Wallace. The\r\ngarment was identified by the bereaved husband. A search of the cabins\r\nwas then made which resulted in finding stolen household effects.\r\n\r\nThe volunteers could hardly be restrained longer. Colonel Williamson\r\nconsulted with his captains, some of whom favored the execution of the\r\nwhole band. But during this council many Indians were brought before it,\r\none at a time, and examined. Not one acknowledged his own guilt, but\r\nsome confessed that others had been on the war path. Some were even then\r\nin their war paint. These revelations produced such an effect upon the\r\nborderers that the Colonel could no longer resist their outcry for\r\nvengeance. He put the question to a vote and only eighteen of the entire\r\nbody of volunteers voted for mercy.\r\n\r\nFriday morning, March 8th, the decree of condemnation was executed. The\r\nIndian men were led, two by two, to the cooper shop and there beaten to\r\ndeath with mallets and hatchets. Two broke away and ran for the river,\r\nbut were shot dead. The women were led to another building and slain\r\nlike the men.\r\n\r\nOnly forty of the volunteers participated in the execution of forty men,\r\ntwenty women and thirty-four children. It is probable that even the\r\nfrontiersmen who stood aside and looked on did not consider their deed a\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\nThe volunteers then burned the Indian village at Schoenbrun, and before\r\nthey departed from Gnadenhuetten they set fire to every building. Salem\r\nwas also destroyed.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks later, on Sunday, March 24, some militiamen attacked the\r\nIndians on Killbuck Island. Several Indians were killed. Killbuck and\r\nmost of his band escaped in canoes.\r\n\r\nGeneral Irvine returned to Fort Pitt from a visit to Philadelphia and\r\nCarlisle the day after the attack and immediately put a stop to the\r\nraids.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                County of Bedford Formed from a Part of\r\n                       Cumberland, March 9, 1771\r\n\r\n\r\nThe county of Bedford was erected March 9, 1771, by an act of the\r\nGeneral Assembly of the Province of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe entire territory for the new county was cut from Cumberland County.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners appointed to “run, mark out, and distinguish the\r\nboundary lines between the said counties of Cumberland and Bedford,”\r\nwere Robert McCrea, William Miller, and Robert Moore.\r\n\r\nThe boundaries of the new county embraced the entire southwestern\r\nportion of the State, from the Tuscarora Mountains westward to the Ohio\r\nand Virginia line.\r\n\r\nMarch 21, 1772, at the time Northumberland County was erected, the\r\nlimits of Bedford County were more definitely explained. Northumberland\r\nCounty was given a part of the original territory of Bedford.\r\n\r\nThe limits of Bedford were afterward reduced by the erection of\r\nWestmoreland in 1773, Huntingdon in 1787, Somerset in 1795, Cambria in\r\n1804, Blair in 1846, and Fulton in 1850. The territory now wholly or in\r\npart of twenty of the present counties of Pennsylvania was in the\r\noriginal Bedford County.\r\n\r\nThe name was taken from the county town, which was selected when the\r\ncounty was erected. The town was so called from the fort of that name,\r\nwhich had been given to it by Governor John Penn, when, by his order the\r\nfort at Raystown was built. This was in honor of one of the dukes of the\r\nhouse of Bedford, in England, during the latter part of the reign of\r\nKing George II.\r\n\r\nThe exact date of the building of Fort Bedford is not certain, but there\r\nis no doubt that the place of defense was celebrated during the French\r\nand Indian Wars. It was one of the earliest settlements west of the\r\nAllegheny Mountains. Mr. Jones in his History of the Juniata Valley\r\nclaims that the earliest settlement on the Raystown Branch of the\r\nJuniata was made by a man named Ray in 1751, who built three cabins near\r\nwhere Bedford now stands. He further says: “In 1755 the province agreed\r\nto open a wagon road from Fort Loudon, in Cumberland County, to the\r\nforks of the Youghiogheny River. For this purpose three hundred men were\r\nsent up, but for some cause or other the project was abandoned.”\r\n\r\nThis road was completed in 1758, when the allied forces of Virginia,\r\nMaryland, and Pennsylvania marched against Fort Duquesne, under General\r\nJohn Forbes.\r\n\r\nA fort was built at this same time at Raystown, and called Fort Bedford.\r\n\r\nMr. Charles N. Hickok, of Bedford, who has written much of the history\r\nof that county, claims that Rae, as he spells the name, defended his\r\nsettlement as early as 1751, almost a decade before the soldiers of\r\nForbes’ exposition arrived there. The settlement was known as “Camp at\r\nRaystown” before General Forbes was encamped there, and his first\r\nofficial papers were so dated.\r\n\r\nEarly in April, 1757, Governor Denny ordered Colonel John Armstrong and\r\nhis battalion to encamp at Raystown, “a well chosen situation on this\r\nside of the Allegheny Hills between two Indian roads.”\r\n\r\nIn June following Captain Hance Hamilton led a scouting party from the\r\n“Fort at Carlisle to Raystown, but encountered no Indians.”\r\n\r\nOn August 16, 1758, Major Joseph Shippen wrote from the camp at\r\nRaystown: “We have a good stockade fort here, with several convenient\r\nand large store houses. Our camps are all secured with good breast works\r\nand a small ditch on the outside, and everything goes well.”\r\n\r\nThe “Old Fort House,” which is still standing, was a large and\r\ncommodious building for the period in which it was erected. It was used\r\nas the officers’ quarters, and was designated as the “King’s House.”\r\n\r\nFort Bedford was the center of much activity during the latter part of\r\nthe French and Indian and the Pontiac Wars. At times more than a\r\nthousand troops were quartered there. There are accounts of mutiny among\r\nthe troops and other exciting incidents.\r\n\r\nIn 1763, Fort Bedford was the principal depot for military stores\r\nbetween Carlisle and Fort Pitt, and in order to further strengthen it,\r\nthe small stockades at Juniata Crossing and Stony Creek were abandoned\r\nand the force concentrated at Fort Bedford.\r\n\r\nIndians never made an attack upon the fort, but killed, scalped, or took\r\nprisoner, eighteen persons, in that immediate neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThe town of Bedford was laid out by Surveyor-General John Lukens, in\r\n1766.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Pontiac War Colonel James Smith, and his celebrated band\r\nof “Black Boys,” were conspicuous for several years and kept the Indians\r\nin check and administered a lasting rebuke to the Proprietary Government\r\nwhen it attempted to furnish food and clothing to the Indians on the\r\nwestern frontier.\r\n\r\nThe history of Fort Bedford was celebrated by the visitations of such\r\ncelebrities as Generals Forbes and Washington, Colonels Armstrong,\r\nBouquet, Burd and others.\r\n\r\nThe first white child born at Raystown was William Fraser.\r\n\r\nThe county buildings, court house and prison, were arranged for in the\r\nact which erected the county. The first session of court was held April\r\n16, 1771, before “William Proctor, Jr., Robert Cluggage, Robert Hanna,\r\nGeorge Wilson, William Lochrey, and William McConnell, Esquires,\r\njustices of our Lord the King.” William Proctor was the first sheriff,\r\nand Arthur St. Clair was appointed first prothonotary, recorder, and\r\nclerk of the court.\r\n\r\nThe first attorney to be sworn was Robert Magraw.\r\n\r\nThe names recommended to the Governor for license as tavern-keepers were\r\nMargaret Fraser, Jean Woods, Frederic Naugel, George Funk, John\r\nCampbell, Joseph Irwin, John Miller, and Samuel Paxton.\r\n\r\nBedford County became an active unit in the State and when the\r\nRevolution broke out she sent her best men into the State Conventions\r\nand during all that long struggle for independence performed her full\r\nduty to Pennsylvania and the colonies.\r\n\r\nBedford County has had some illustrious sons among whom were Hon. Thomas\r\nSmith, Hon. Jonathan Walker, Hon. Charles Huston, Hon. John Tod, Hon.\r\nJeremiah S. Black, all members of the Supreme Court, and other high\r\noffices; United States Senator Hon. William Wilkins, and Hon. John S.\r\nCarlisle, who served as United States Senator from West Virginia, and\r\nothers\r\n\r\nThe medicinal springs at Bedford are widely and justly celebrated, and\r\nthe town is one of the most attractive resorts in all this country.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Organization of Sixty-seven Counties of\r\n                 Pennsylvania Began with Philadelphia,\r\n                             March 10, 1682\r\n\r\n\r\nThe three original counties of Pennsylvania were Philadelphia, Chester\r\nand Bucks. Some authorities claim Philadelphia was the original county\r\nand the others formed soon thereafter. These authorities give the date\r\nof the erection of Philadelphia County as March 10, 1682.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania historians generally agree that the three were originally\r\nerected at the same time by William Penn. Philadelphia extended toward\r\nthe northwest, bounded on either side by its neighboring counties, Bucks\r\nand Chester.\r\n\r\nBucks was called Buckingham in a letter written by William Penn to the\r\nSociety of Free Traders in 1683. At that time its northern boundary was\r\nthe Kittatinny Mountains, or as far as the land might be purchased from\r\nthe Indians—a very indeterminate line.\r\n\r\nChester County included what is now Delaware County, and all the\r\nterritory, except a small portion now in Philadelphia County southwest\r\nof the Schuykill, to the extreme limits of the Province.\r\n\r\nThe first county to be formed in addition to the three original counties\r\nwas Lancaster, which was taken from the territory of Chester County May\r\n10, 1729. Its boundaries then comprised “all the province lying to the\r\nnorthward of the Octararo Creek, and westward of a line of marked trees\r\nrunning from the north branch of the said Octararo Creek northeasterly\r\nto the Schuylkill.” This new county was first reduced in size August 19,\r\n1749, when York County was cut from its territory; and secondly on\r\nJanuary 27, 1750, when the big county of Cumberland was erected from\r\nLancaster. The limits of Cumberland then included the whole country west\r\nto the boundary of the State, or as far as the preceding Indian\r\npurchase.\r\n\r\nBucks County was reduced in size when Northampton County was erected\r\nfrom its territory, March 11, 1752, and on the same day the County of\r\nBerks was erected from Philadelphia, Bucks and Lancaster. Thus the\r\nProvince of Pennsylvania continued with the eight counties until March\r\n9, 1771, when Bedford was formed from Cumberland, the first of the many\r\ncounties taken from her territory.\r\n\r\nNorthumberland County was erected March 21, 1772, from parts of\r\nLancaster, Cumberland, Berks, Bedford and Northampton. On account of\r\nIndian purchases now reaching to the western boundaries of the State,\r\nthe limits of Northumberland reached to the western and northern\r\nboundaries of the State. Her territory was so extensive that she has\r\nbeen known as “The Mother of Counties,” and all or parts of thirty of\r\nthe present counties of Pennsylvania have been taken from the original\r\nterritory of “Old Mother Northumberland.”\r\n\r\nFebruary 26, 1773, was erected the County of Westmoreland, whose\r\nterritory was taken from Bedford County. It then included the entire\r\nsouthwestern section of the State. The next county to be erected was\r\nWashington, on March 28, 1781, and its territory was taken from\r\nWestmoreland, as was the County of Fayette, formed September 26, 1783.\r\nThus, Westmoreland was considerably reduced in size within ten years\r\nfrom its organization.\r\n\r\nFranklin County was erected September 9, 1784, and its territory taken\r\nfrom Cumberland. The following day, September 10, 1784, Montgomery\r\nCounty was formed from a part of Philadelphia County, the last territory\r\nto be taken from the original county.\r\n\r\nMarch 4, 1785, Dauphin was cut off from Lancaster; September 25, 1786,\r\nLuzerne was erected from Northumberland, and September 20, 1787,\r\nHuntingdon was formed from Bedford.\r\n\r\nAllegheny County was formed from Westmoreland and Washington Counties,\r\nSeptember 24, 1788. Mifflin was formed from Cumberland and\r\nNorthumberland Counties September 19, 1789.\r\n\r\nOld Chester County lost part of its territory when Delaware County was\r\ncut from it September 26, 1789. Thus the county which comprised the most\r\nancient settlements in Pennsylvania was now formed into the new County\r\nof Delaware, and the organization of counties in the southeastern part\r\nof the State completed.\r\n\r\nWhen the County of Lycoming was cut from Northumberland, April 13, 1795,\r\nit was for years the largest county of the State. Four days later the\r\nCounty of Somerset was formed from Bedford. Green County was cut from\r\nWashington February 9, 1796, thus completing the formation of counties\r\nin the southwest corner of the State.\r\n\r\nThe next county to be formed was that of Wayne, which was set off from\r\nNorthampton March 21, 1797, and formed the northeastern corner of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nAdams was erected from York January 22, 1800, and February 13 following\r\nCenter was formed from parts of Northumberland, Lycoming, Mifflin and\r\nHuntingdon, and March 12 eight new counties—Armstrong, Beaver, Butler,\r\nCrawford, Erie, Mercer, Venango and Warren—were formed. Thus, the\r\nremaining corner of the State was organized. The counties were taken\r\nfrom Lycoming and Allegheny, Westmoreland furnished a part of Armstrong\r\nand Washington yielded up a portion for Beaver, but Allegheny furnished\r\nthe largest amount of territory for the new counties.\r\n\r\nIndiana was cut from Westmoreland and Lycoming, March 30, 1803.\r\n\r\nSix new counties were erected on March 26, 1804, when Cambria,\r\nClearfield, Jefferson, McKean, Potter and Tioga were formed. The latter\r\nfour being taken from Lycoming, while Northumberland helped with\r\nClearfield, but Cambria was cut from parts of Huntingdon, Somerset and\r\nBedford. Bradford and Susquehanna, were formed February 21, 1810, the\r\nformer from Lycoming and Luzerne and the latter from Luzerne alone.\r\n\r\nMarch 11, 1811, Schuylkill was formed from Berks and Northampton. March\r\n6, 1812, Lehigh was taken from Northampton, and February 16, 1813,\r\nLebanon was erected from Lancaster and Dauphin. Columbia and Union were\r\nerected March 22, 1813, both being taken from Northumberland. Pike was\r\ncut from Wayne, March 26, 1814, and Perry was taken from Cumberland,\r\nMarch 22, 1820.\r\n\r\nThe State remained thus until Juniata was formed, March 2, 1831, from\r\nMifflin; Monroe was taken from Northampton and Pike, April 1, 1836;\r\nClarion was taken from Venango and Armstrong, March 11, 1839, and on\r\nJune 21 following Clinton was formed from Lycoming and Center. Wyoming\r\nwas erected from Luzerne, April 4, 1842, and Carbon was formed from\r\nNorthampton and Monroe, March 13, 1843. April 18 following, Elk was cut\r\nfrom Jefferson, Clearfield and McKean.\r\n\r\nBlair was formed February 26, 1846 from Huntingdon and Bedford; Sullivan\r\nwas taken from Lycoming, March 15, 1847; Forest was formed from\r\nJefferson and Venango, April 11, 1848; Lawrence from Beaver and Mercer,\r\nMarch 20, 1849; Fulton was cut from Bedford, April 19, 1850, and little\r\nMontour was taken from Columbia, May 3, of the same year.\r\n\r\nSnyder was formed from Union March 2, 1855, and March 29, 1860, Cameron\r\nwas cut from parts of Clinton, Elk, McKean and Potter.\r\n\r\nThe last of the sixty-seven counties of Pennsylvania is Lackawanna which\r\nwas cut from Luzerne, August 13, 1878.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Public Education Established by Governor\r\n                  George Wolf, Who Died March 11, 1840\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Wolf, the seventh Governor of Pennsylvania, was born in Allen\r\nTownship, Northampton County, August 12, 1777, and died March 11, 1840.\r\n\r\nHe attended a classical school established in the county by a society\r\nformed for the purpose, which was presided over by Robert Andrews, A.\r\nM., a graduate of Trinity College, Dublin. Here he acquired a good\r\nknowledge of the Latin and Greek languages and of the sciences usually\r\npursued in a liberal education. Leaving school he took charge of his\r\nfather’s farm and also acted as principal of the academy in his native\r\ntownship. Before his majority he acted as clerk to the prothonotary, at\r\nthe same time studying law under the direction of John Ross.\r\n\r\nHe early espoused the political principles of Thomas Jefferson, and when\r\nthe latter became President he appointed Mr. Wolf Postmaster at Easton,\r\nand shortly after Governor Thomas McKean appointed him Clerk of the\r\nOrphans’ Court of Northampton County, which office he held until 1809.\r\n\r\nIn 1814 he was elected a member of the Legislature, and in 1824 he was\r\nelected a Representative in Congress, a position he acceptably filled\r\nfor three terms.\r\n\r\nIn 1829 he was chosen Governor of Pennsylvania over Joseph Ritner.\r\n\r\nMr. Wolf was not an active aspirant for the office of Governor and\r\nreceived the nomination without knowing that any considerable strength\r\nin the convention was in his favor. He accepted the nomination,\r\nabandoned his lucrative practice and entered vigorously into the\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nAt this period there began to be a change in the political horizon of\r\nthe state. A fearful crusade was made against secret societies, which\r\nwere denounced as tending to subvert government.\r\n\r\nCommencing in the New England States, the reported abduction of a\r\ntraitor to the Freemasons in Batavia, New York, assisted to spread\r\nrapidly the contagion, and party lines were almost equally drawn in the\r\nState of Pennsylvania. The Federal party lost its identity, and the\r\nAnti-Masons sprang up like mushrooms. Their candidate, Joseph Ritner,\r\nwas defeated at the first election by seventeen thousand and at the\r\nsecond by only three thousand out of a poll of almost two hundred\r\nthousand.\r\n\r\nWhen Governor Wolf came into office the financial affairs of the\r\nCommonwealth, owing to the extensive scheme of public improvements, then\r\nprogressing at a fair rate, were in deplorable condition. There was but\r\none course to pursue which would maintain the credit of the State and\r\nthat was to push the works to rapid completion. This was done and in a\r\nfew years he with others had the proud satisfaction of beholding how far\r\nthese needed improvements went towards developing the great natural\r\nresources of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nBut the most substantial and enduring merit of Governor Wolf was evinced\r\nin his advocacy of a system of popular education.\r\n\r\nJames Buchanan, in a speech delivered at West Chester previous to the\r\nelection of the Governor, had said: “If ever the passion of envy could\r\nbe excused a man ambitious of true glory, he might almost be justified\r\nin envying the fame of the favored individual, whoever he may be, whom\r\nProvidence intends to make the instrument in establishing Common Schools\r\nthroughout the Commonwealth. His task will be arduous. He will have many\r\ndifficulties to encounter and many prejudices to overcome; but his fame\r\nwill exceed that of the great Clinton, in the same proportion that mind\r\nis superior to matter. Whilst, the one has erected a frail memorial,\r\nwhich like everything human must decay and perish, the other will raise\r\na monument which shall flourish in immortal youth, and endure whilst the\r\nhuman soul shall continue to exist. ‘Ages unborn and nations yet behind’\r\nshall bless his memory.”\r\n\r\nTo Governor George Wolf that honor was accorded.\r\n\r\nThe Governor, in his annual message, December, 1831 said in reference to\r\nthis subject: “It is cause for no ordinary measure of gratification that\r\nthe Legislature, at its last session, considered this subject worthy of\r\nits deliberations, and advancing one step toward the intellectual\r\nregeneration of the State by laying a foundation for raising a fund to\r\nbe employed hereafter in the righteous cause of a practical general\r\neducation. It is no less gratifying to know that public opinion is\r\ngiving strong indications of having undergone a favorable change in\r\nreference to this momentous measure, and by its gradual but powerful\r\nworkings is fast dispelling the groveling fallacies, but too long\r\nprevalent, that gold is preferable to knowledge and that dollars and\r\ncents are of a higher estimation than learning. I would suggest for your\r\nconsideration the propriety of appointing a commission, to consist of\r\nthree or more talented and intelligent individuals, known friends of a\r\nliberal and enlightened system of education, whose duty it should be to\r\ncollect all the information and possess themselves of all the facts and\r\nknowledge that can be obtained from any quarter having a bearing upon or\r\nconnection with the subject of education, and arrange and embody the\r\nsame in a report to the Legislature.”\r\n\r\nIn compliance with this wise recommendation, Senator Samuel Breck, of\r\nPhiladelphia, was made chairman of the committee, which reported a bill,\r\nembodying what were believed to be the best features of those systems\r\nwhich had been most successful in other States, and at the session of\r\n1834 it passed both branches of the Legislature with a unanimity rarely\r\nequaled in legislation. The bill was approved by the Governor April 1,\r\n1834.\r\n\r\nAlthough the school bill was adopted with comparative unanimity, it was\r\nat once attacked by a storm of opposition in certain sections of the\r\nState. The opposition was well crystallized when the Legislature\r\nconvened in the fall of 1834.\r\n\r\nGovernor Wolf’s message was firm, but the members had been flooded with\r\npetitions for the repeal of the measure.\r\n\r\nOn April 11, 1835, Thaddeus Stevens, by a memorable speech and a\r\nremarkable parliamentary effort, swayed the opposition, and by a vote of\r\n55 to 30 successfully defended the schools when threatened with\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nThus public education in Pennsylvania was saved; but Governor Wolf, who\r\nhad advocated it so strenuously, was defeated for a third term by Joseph\r\nRitner.\r\n\r\nRetiring from the gubernatorial chair, he was appointed by President\r\nJackson in 1836, to the office of First Comptroller of the Treasury.\r\nAfter holding this position for two years he was appointed by President\r\nVan Buren to be Collector of the Port of Philadelphia, which he held\r\nuntil his death on March 11, 1840.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Lands Set Apart for Soldiers of Revolution,\r\n                             March 12, 1783\r\n\r\n\r\nThe soldiers of the Pennsylvania Line who served in the War of the\r\nRevolution were by act of legislation entitled to wild lands of the\r\nState and a large area of the northwestern portion of the State north of\r\nthe depreciation lands and west of the Allegheny River was set apart and\r\nsurveyed to the officers and soldiers.\r\n\r\nAs early as March 7, 1780, while the war for the independence of the\r\nAmerican colonies was still in active progress, and being vigorously\r\nwaged by the hostile armies in the field, the General Assembly of\r\nPennsylvania, by resolution, made a promise of “certain donations and\r\nquantities of land” to the soldiers of the State, known as the\r\n“Pennsylvania Line,” then serving in the Continental Army.\r\n\r\nThis resolution provided that these lands should be “surveyed and\r\ndivided off” at the end of the war, and allotted to those entitled to\r\nreceive them according to their several rank. In order to comply with\r\nthe letter and intention of the resolution, an act was passed by the\r\nGeneral Assembly on March 12, 1783, by the provisions of which certain\r\nlands were set apart to be sold for the purpose of redeeming the\r\ncertificates of depreciation given to the soldiers of the Pennsylvania\r\nLine. It also provided that a certain tract of country, beginning at the\r\nmouth of Mogulbughtition Creek, now known as Mahoning Creek, in\r\nArmstrong County; then up the Allegheny River to the mouth of Cagnawaga\r\nCreek, in now Warren County; thence due north to the northern boundary\r\nof the State; thence west by the said boundary, to the northwest corner\r\nof the State, thence south, by the western boundary of the State, to the\r\nnorthwest corner of lands appropriated by the act for discharging the\r\ndepreciation certificates; and thence by the same lands east to the\r\nplace of beginning, “which said tract of country shall be reserved and\r\nset apart for the only and sole use of fulfilling and carrying into\r\nexecution the said resolve.”\r\n\r\nThe territory thus set apart comprised parts of the present counties of\r\nLawrence, Butler, Armstrong, Venango, Forest and Warren, all of the\r\ncounties of Mercer and Crawford and that portion of Erie County which\r\nlies south of the triangle.\r\n\r\nThis territory was a wild and unbroken wilderness, except at the few\r\nplaces fortified by the French and later occupied by the English and\r\nColonists during the Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the First and Second Battalions of the Province of\r\nPennsylvania in the French and Indian War petitioned for and received\r\ntwenty-four thousand acres of land along the West Branch of the\r\nSusquehanna River, and these officers and their families thus became\r\npioneer settlers in that picturesque valley, and now the veterans of the\r\nRevolution were given homes in the northwestern section of the State and\r\nthere planted the settlements which have grown into the most important\r\nindustrial centers of the Western Hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThe act of March 12, 1783, gave a clear title to the land, for under\r\nSection 6, all rights, titles, or claims to land within the described\r\nbounds, whether obtained from the Indians, the late Proprietaries, or\r\nany other person or persons, were declared to be null and void, thus\r\nreserving the entire tract from sale or settlement until after the\r\nallotments to the soldiers were duly made and their claims fully\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\nBy the following section of the act the officers and enlisted soldiers\r\nwere to be allowed two years after the declaration of peace in which to\r\nmake their applications, and in event of death occurring before any\r\nveteran made his application, an additional year was allowed his heirs,\r\nexecutors or administrators to make application. Thereafter the\r\nunlocated tracts were to be disposed of upon such terms as the\r\nLegislature might direct. This period for making applications was many\r\ntimes extended, so that no veteran was deprived of a fair opportunity to\r\nobtain his tract of the donation land.\r\n\r\nThe authorities of Pennsylvania were even more thoughtful of these\r\nRevolutionary veterans, for the General Assembly passed an act which\r\nexempted from taxation during lifetime the land which fell to lot of\r\neach veteran unless the same was transferred or assigned to another\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nThen followed the great purchase of October 23, 1784, and then the Act\r\nof March 24, 1785, which directed the manner in which the allowances of\r\nland were to be distributed to the troops, and provided for legal\r\ntitles, vesting in them the right of ownership.\r\n\r\nA section of the act described the persons who should be entitled to\r\nland, and Section 5, in order to comply with a previous resolution of\r\nthe General Assembly, included the names of Baron Steuben, the German\r\npatriot drill master of the Continental Army, who was to receive a grant\r\nequal to that of a major general of the Pennsylvania Line, and\r\nLieutenant Colonel Tilghman a grant equal to his rank.\r\n\r\nComplete lists of all soldiers entitled to land were furnished by the\r\nComptroller General to the Supreme Executive Council, and these\r\nclaimants were divided into four classes.\r\n\r\nUpon application of the officers of the Pennsylvania Line, General\r\nWilliam Irvine, the commanding officer at Fort Pitt, was appointed agent\r\nto explore the lands, as he was well acquainted with all the land\r\nappropriated for donation purposes.\r\n\r\nGeneral Irvine entered upon his duties promptly and seemed to have\r\nexercised good judgment. An interesting report of his notes and\r\nobservations was transmitted to President John Dickinson of the Supreme\r\nExecutive Council in a letter dated at Carlisle, August 17, 1785. The\r\nstreams, boundaries and other natural terrain were carefully described,\r\nand the general gave a most comprehensive narrative of his every act\r\nwhile on this important tour of duty.\r\n\r\nSection 8 provided minute directions for the distribution of the tracts\r\nby lottery.\r\n\r\nThe drawing of the lottery commenced October 1, 1786, and was to\r\ncontinue one year. The committee of the Supreme Executive Council\r\nselected to superintend the drawing consisted of Captain John Boyd,\r\nJonathan Hoge, Stephen Balliet and William Brown, to which was shortly\r\nadded Peter Muhlenberg and Samuel Dean.\r\n\r\nThe time of the drawing was subsequently extended until under various\r\nlaws the last limit of time was fixed as April 1, 1810, and from that\r\nday the offices were closed against any further applications for\r\ndonation lands.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Colonel Matthew Smith, Hero of Early Wars,\r\n                          Born March 13, 1740\r\n\r\n\r\nMatthew Smith was the eldest son of Robert Smith, and was born March 13,\r\n1740, in Paxtang, then Lancaster County, but since March 4, 1785, a part\r\nof Dauphin County. At the age of fifteen he was a soldier under Colonel\r\nHenry Bouquet, serving in the final campaign of the French and Indian\r\nWar. During the interim between that war and the Revolutionary War he\r\nwas an active leader among the early settlers in what are now Dauphin,\r\nCumberland and Northumberland Counties, a leader in the struggles\r\nagainst the Indians and a respected and brave frontiersman.\r\n\r\nLate in 1763 the Indians, especially the Conestoga, caused much\r\nsuffering in the lower Susquehanna region and the territory between\r\nHarris’ Ferry and the Schuylkill. The terrible incursions perpetrated\r\nand the many murders committed by these savages resulted in having the\r\nprovincial authorities place these Indians under their care in\r\nLancaster, Conestoga and Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThis protection so incensed the settlers, who had lost many of their kin\r\nthrough the perfidy of the so-called friendly Indians, that an appeal\r\nwas made to the authorities against this support and protection, but no\r\nattention was given the frontiersmen.\r\n\r\nThese settlers continued to suffer until their patience was sorely\r\ntried. They then took matters in their own hands and banded together as\r\nthe “Paxtang Boys,” under the leadership of Captains Matthew Smith and\r\nLazarus Stewart, and they made a clean job of their design.\r\n\r\nThe “Paxtang Boys” marched to Lancaster, December 27, 1763, broke into\r\nthe workhouse, and before their anger could be suppressed the last of\r\nthe so-called “Conestogas” had yielded up his life. After this no other\r\nmurder was committed by the Indians among the settlers in this vicinity.\r\n\r\nCaptain Matthew Smith, as one of the actual leaders, seems to have borne\r\nthe lion’s share of the blame for the act.\r\n\r\nFebruary 13, 1764, a lengthy declaration was prepared for presentation\r\nto the General Assembly, then meeting in Philadelphia, signed by two of\r\nthe citizens, Matthew Smith and James Gibson. The petition stated,\r\nhowever, that they signed it “on behalf of ourselves and by appointment\r\nof a great number of the frontier inhabitants.” This petition was one of\r\nthe most important ever presented to a Pennsylvania Legislature and\r\ncaused much heated debate.\r\n\r\nA long and exciting siege in the Assembly was enacted by the leaders. On\r\none side were Benjamin Franklin, Israel Pemberton, the Quaker leader,\r\nand Joseph Galloway, and on the popular side, or that of the people and\r\nthe “Paxtang Boys,” were the Rev. John Ewing, the Rev. Gilbert Tennent,\r\nDr. David James Dove and many others.\r\n\r\nAs a stronger act in supporting their position the “Paxtang Boys”\r\nplanned a march to Philadelphia and started in a body under Captain\r\nMatthew Smith. Great consternation was witnessed in the capital city.\r\nThe militia was called out and all business was suspended. But the\r\ndelegation was not warlike and totally unaware of the anxiety felt in\r\nPhiladelphia or of the military preparations made to receive them.\r\nProudly bearing their declaration, approved by fifteen hundred of the\r\nfrontier inhabitants, with many letters from prominent personages, they\r\nwere met by commissioners sent out by the Governor, to whom they made\r\nknown their intentions. Captain Smith presented their declarations to\r\nthe Assembly, which was termed in the minutes of that day as “The\r\ndeclaration of the rioters and the petition of the back inhabitants.”\r\nDuring the long debate the main body of the party returned home and thus\r\nended the “Paxtang Boys’ Insurrection.”\r\n\r\nAt the very outbreak of the Revolution Captain Smith organized a company\r\nof riflemen, which was assigned to Colonel Thompson’s battalion. After a\r\ntedious march overland from Dauphin County to Boston, the company joined\r\nthe Continental Army at that place and on September 5, 1775, his company\r\nwas detached to General Arnold’s command for the expedition to Canada.\r\n\r\nHe survived the hardships of the march through the Maine woods, the\r\ndisastrous assault at Quebec December 31, and the brief confinement as a\r\nprisoner of war which followed, when he joined his regiment together\r\nwith the few survivors of his company, but he soon thereafter resigned\r\nhis commission on December 5, 1776. Captain Smith’s services were,\r\nhowever, much appreciated and he was promoted to full rank of major,\r\nSeptember 27, 1777, and assigned to the Ninth Pennsylvania Regiment.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1778 he was elected by the citizens of the central part\r\nof the Province as a member of the Supreme Executive Council. October\r\n11, 1779, he was elected vice president of the Commonwealth of\r\nPennsylvania, but resigned shortly after assuming the responsible duties\r\nof his high office.\r\n\r\nWhen the intelligence of the capture and total destruction of Fort\r\nFreeland, on Warrior Run, in Northumberland County, reached Paxtang,\r\nMatthew Smith marched to Sunbury with a volunteer militia of fifty men\r\nraised by his own efforts and made a hurried march to overtake the\r\nBritish commander, Captain McDonald, and the retreating British\r\ninvaders, including their Indian allies.\r\n\r\nThis distinguished statesman-soldier-patriot established himself in a\r\nfine residence, in what is now the Fourth Ward of Milton and became its\r\nmost influential and revered citizen.\r\n\r\nThe following obituary appeared in Kennedy’s Gazette, published at\r\nNorthumberland, under date July 30, 1794:\r\n\r\n“Died, the 22d inst., about sunset at Milton, Colonel Matthew Smith,\r\naged fifty-four years, being one of the first patriots for liberty; went\r\nto Canada in the year 1775, and suffered extremities. He was once\r\nprothonotary of Northumberland County. Was interred 23d inst., attended\r\nby a large number of his friends and acquaintances, together with a\r\nvolunteer company of light infantry from Milton, conducted by Major\r\nPratt, and commanded by Captain James Boyd, who, marching about six\r\nmiles to Warrior Run burying ground and shedding a tear over the old\r\npatriot’s grave, deposited his remains with three well directed volleys\r\nand returned home in good order.”\r\n\r\nLinn’s Annals of Buffalo Valley is authority for the statement that\r\nthese soldiers actually carried the body the entire distance of six\r\nmiles to the old cemetery, where his bones now repose. The dust of this\r\npatriot, soldier and statesman lies within a few rods of the very fort\r\nhe rushed from Paxtang with his brave militiamen to protect. His grave\r\nis unmarked and few have knowledge that he is buried there.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Fries’ Rebellion or Hot-Water War Arouses\r\n                        Governor, March 14, 1799\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1798 the Federal Government enacted a direct tax law, which became\r\nknown as the “house tax,” and was unpopular in many parts of the\r\ncountry, especially in some of the counties of Pennsylvania, and it led\r\nto an insurrection known in history as “Fries’ Rebellion.”\r\n\r\nThe story of this insurrection, as told in “Pennsylvania Colonial and\r\nFederal” by Jenkins, is as follows:\r\n\r\n“The troubles between the United States and France at this time assumed\r\nthe form of active hostilities, and James McHenry, Secretary of War,\r\nbegan to organize an army. The President was given authority to borrow\r\n$5,000,000, and $2,000,000 more was to be raised by a new and odious\r\ntax. This tax was direct, and fell upon houses, lands and slaves.\r\n\r\n“For every slave between the ages of twelve and fifty years, fifty cents\r\nwas to be required of the owner. For every house valued at from $200 to\r\n$500, twenty cents per $100 was required, while the tax was thirty cents\r\nper 100 on houses valued from $500 to $1000.\r\n\r\n“There were but few slaves in Pennsylvania, and as a result the tax fell\r\nmainly on houses and lands. The value of the houses was determined by\r\ncounting the number and measuring the size of the windows. Houses with\r\nbut few and small windows were rated lower, and in order to save the tax\r\nthe farmers usually had small windows in their houses. Pennsylvania’s\r\nshare of the tax was $232,177.72.”\r\n\r\nThe assessors and collectors of the tax found very little difficulty and\r\nopposition until the eastern part of the State was reached. It was in\r\nthe counties of Bucks, Montgomery and Northampton, almost within sight\r\nof the Federal capital, that the opposition became alarming, arising\r\nfrom the fact that the German people did not understand the law. Many a\r\nfarmer knew nothing of the tax until the assessor came around. The\r\npeople remembered the old hearth tax of Germany, and they thought this\r\ntax was a revival of it.\r\n\r\nWomen set dogs on the assessors, and poured scalding water on them when\r\nthey tried to measure windows. This fact has also given the name “Hot\r\nWater War” to the affair. In a number of townships, associations of the\r\npeople were formed in order to prevent the officers from performing\r\ntheir duty.\r\n\r\nIn many places, violence was actually used and the assessors were taken\r\nand imprisoned by armed parties. The insurrection rose to such a height\r\nthat it became necessary to compel the execution of the laws, and\r\nwarrants were issued against certain persons and served upon them.\r\nHeadquarters were appointed for the prisoners at Bethlehem but a number\r\nof persons marched there and demanded the release of the prisoners. The\r\noperations of the mob were so hostile that the marshals could offer no\r\nresistance, so the prisoners were released.\r\n\r\nThe leading spirit in the opposition to the Government was John Fries, a\r\nfarmer’s son, born in Hatfield Township, Montgomery County, in 1750. He\r\nlearned the cooper trade and in 1779 married Mary Brunner, of Whitemarsh\r\nTownship. In 1775 Fries removed to Lower Milford Township, Bucks County.\r\nHe saw service in the Revolution. He also helped to put down the Whisky\r\nInsurrection in Western Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nAfter settling in Bucks County, Fries became a traveling auctioneer and\r\njourneyed from village to village in this employment. He and his dog,\r\nWhiskey, were familiar figures in every country store. He could speak\r\nGerman fluently and in his rounds had excellent opportunities to\r\ndenounce the tax.\r\n\r\nFries was present at a meeting in February, 1798, at the house of Jacob\r\nKline, near the point of union of the four counties of Montgomery,\r\nBucks, Lehigh and Berks. Fries assisted in drawing up a paper in\r\nopposition to the tax, which received fifty-five names. He also pledged\r\nhimself to raise 700 men to resist the tax. His expressions against the\r\nlaw were very violent, and he threatened to shoot one of the assessors,\r\nMr. Foulke, through the legs if he proceeded to assess the houses. Fries\r\nand his partisans followed and persecuted a number of the assessors,\r\nchasing them from township to township.\r\n\r\nFries was armed with a large horse pistol, and a man named Kuyder\r\nassisted him in command. Learning that the marshal had taken a number of\r\nprisoners, the rioters determined to rescue them. Fries drew up a paper\r\nat his own house, setting forth their design, and the next morning more\r\nthan twenty followers appeared in arms. They then set out for Bethlehem\r\nto release the prisoners. The marshal was intimidated and the imprisoned\r\nrioters were released.\r\n\r\nThe Government became greatly alarmed at these proceedings. The\r\nPresident issued a proclamation commanding rioters to disperse. He also\r\ncalled upon the Governor and militia of Pennsylvania to assist in\r\nmaintaining order. Governor Mifflin issued a proclamation March 14,\r\n1799, and on March 20 the cavalry from Philadelphia, Chester,\r\nMontgomery, Bucks and Lancaster Counties was called out and encamped at\r\nSpringhouse, Montgomery County. Here General MacPherson issued a\r\nproclamation to the rioters. Proceeding to Quakertown, the army began to\r\nmake arrests and to scour the country in search of rioters.\r\n\r\nAfter releasing the prisoners at Bethlehem, Fries returned to his old\r\nemployment, but was arrested while holding a vendue. At the cry of the\r\nsoldiers he leaped to the ground and fled to a swamp. He was arrested\r\nfor treason, and with some thirty others taken to Philadelphia for\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\nThe case of Fries was called up in Federal Court at Philadelphia on\r\nApril 30, 1799. His lawyers were Alexander J. Dallas and Messrs. Ewing\r\nand Lewis. Messrs. Rawle and Sitgrave were the counsel for the United\r\nStates. The verdict was guilty, but as it appeared after the verdict\r\nthat one of the jury, previous to being empaneled, had expressed the\r\nopinion that Fries ought to be hanged, a new trial was granted. The\r\nsecond trial was called April 29, 1800. At the former trial Fries’\r\nlawyers argued at great length that the offense was only riot and not\r\ntreason. They cited many cases in support of their view. But the Court\r\nrelied upon the definition of treason in the Constitution.\r\n\r\nFries’ counsel then refused to appear further in the case. He was again\r\ndeclared guilty, the Friday for the hanging was named and the sheriff’s\r\nposse was selected.\r\n\r\nThe cause of Fries was espoused by the old Republican Party and by a\r\nnumber of newspapers throughout the State. The Aurora denounced the\r\naction of the officers and charged that the Army lived in free quarters\r\non the inhabitants. The Adler, a German paper published in Reading also\r\ncondemned the course of the Government and claimed that the troops\r\nimposed upon the people as they marched through the country. Discussion\r\non the subject became so bitter that it entered into National and State\r\npolitics and became an important issue.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime National political affairs were so developing that\r\nPresident Adams was led to pardon Fries.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Mollie Maguires Murder Wm. H. Littlehales,\r\n                      March 15, 1869, Which Brings\r\n                       Detective McParlan to the\r\n                              Coal Regions\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bloody record of the Mollie Maguires during the decade 1865 to 1875\r\nmarks the darkest and most terrible period in the history of the\r\nanthracite coal regions of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThis was a secret organization, composed of lawless Irishmen, who\r\nresorted to murder in its most cowardly form, to attain their ends and\r\nsatisfy their revengeful feelings toward mine owners, superintendents\r\nand bosses, and also justices of the peace and borough officials who had\r\nthe integrity to administer justice, and not cringe before these\r\ncriminals, when under arrest.\r\n\r\nThe members of this organization became unusually active and\r\nbloodthirsty in 1865. On August 25 of that year David Muir, a colliery\r\nsuperintendent, was cruelly murdered in Foster Township, Schuylkill\r\nCounty; January 10, 1866, Henry H. Dunne, superintendent of a colliery\r\nand one of the leading citizens of Pottsville, was murdered on the\r\npublic road, near his home.\r\n\r\nThere were other crimes committed by the members of this organization,\r\nbut those which most aroused the indignation of the public were where\r\nprominent men were killed from ambush for no apparent reason than that\r\nthey held responsible position in a coal company.\r\n\r\nOctober 17, 1868, Alexander Rea was murdered near Centralia, Columbia\r\nCounty, and this crime was the most heinous up to this time. Arrests\r\nwere made, and a strong chain of circumstantial evidence made out by the\r\nCommonwealth against them. One of the accomplices even gave out the\r\nfacts which caused the apprehension of the others.\r\n\r\nSeparate trials were granted by the Columbia County Court, and Thomas\r\nDonahue was tried first. He was defended by Messrs. Ryon, Freeze,\r\nStrouse, Wolverton and Marr. He was acquitted February, 1869. The\r\nothers, Pat Hester, Peter McHugh, and Pat Tully, were not then placed on\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\nBut the next and most important outrage committed by the Mollie Maguires\r\nwas the murder of William H. Littlehales, superintendent of the Glen\r\nCarbon Coal Company, in Cass Township, Schuylkill County.\r\n\r\nThis crime occurred March 15, 1869, on the main highway leading from his\r\nhome to the mines. The act was witnessed by several persons, but the\r\nassassins escaped.\r\n\r\nIt was this act which caused Hon. Franklin B. Gowen, President of the\r\nPhiladelphia and Reading Railway Company, and the Philadelphia and\r\nReading Coal and Iron Company to send for Mr. Allan Pinkerton, and\r\nengage his services in dispersing this murderous crew.\r\n\r\nMr. Pinkerton accepted the employment offered him and assigned to the\r\nprincipal task a young man named James McParlan, a native of Ireland,\r\naged twenty-eight years.\r\n\r\nMcParlan set out on his mission Monday, October 27, 1873, in the\r\ndisguise of a vagabond Irishman seeking employment in the mines, and as\r\na criminal who was seeking refuge from crimes committed in the vicinity\r\nof Buffalo, N. Y.\r\n\r\nHe assumed the name of James McKenna, and as such won his way into the\r\nconfidence of the Mollies, joined their organization and became known as\r\nthe most desperate Mollie in all the anthracite region.\r\n\r\nMany others were murdered after McParlan arrived in the region. He\r\nprevented murder when it was possible to do so. He warned those who were\r\nto be victims through Mr. Franklin, superintendent of the Philadelphia\r\nand Reading Coal Company, with whom he kept in daily contact by clever\r\ncorrespondence.\r\n\r\nUp to the hour that James McParlan arrived in Schuylkill County, no\r\ninformation had been obtained concerning the identity of those who\r\nmurdered Littlehales, nor had it been possible to convict a single\r\nMollie Maguire in any court where they were brought to trial.\r\n\r\nAnother crime which McParlan was sent to investigate was the murder of\r\nMorgan Powell, at Summit Hill, Carbon County, which occurred December 2,\r\n1871. These were enough to occupy the time of a man even as clever as\r\nDetective McParlan alias James McKenna.\r\n\r\nDuring the more than two years that McParlan lived among the Mollies he\r\ndid not learn the murderers of Littlehales but succeeded in bringing to\r\njustice many other murderers.\r\n\r\nThe arrests quickly followed one another when once begun early in 1876.\r\nThe trials began in Mauch Chunk in March. While McParlan did not testify\r\nin the first case he furnished very valuable information, and greatly\r\nassisted the prosecution.\r\n\r\nThen followed the arrest and trial of others in Pottsville, Mauch Chunk\r\nand Bloomsburg with the conviction of many.\r\n\r\nMcParlan went upon the stand in the trial of James Carrol, Thomas Duffy,\r\nJames Roarty, Hugh McGehan, and James Boyle, for the murder of B. F.\r\nYost, which occurred at Tamaqua, July 6, 1875. This trial was held at\r\nPottsville, before a full bench of Hon. C. L. Pershing, D. B. Green and\r\nT. H. Walker. James Kerrigan, a Mollie, was a witness for the\r\nCommonwealth.\r\n\r\nThe trial of Thomas Munley in June, 1876, in the same court, for the\r\nmurder of Thomas Sanger and William Uren, brought Mr. F. B. Gowen into\r\nthe case and the delivery of his wonderful speech, which will ever\r\nremain one of the greatest in the history of the criminal courts of our\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThe Mollies were convicted of murder in the first degree and paid the\r\nextreme penalty on the gallows.\r\n\r\nMany other Mollies were hanged, and on May 21, 1877, Governor J. F.\r\nHartranft issued warrants for the execution of eight of the Mollie\r\nMaguires, which brought to an end the bloody record of this nefarious\r\norganization.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                David Wilmot, Author of Proviso, Died at\r\n                        Towanda, March 16, 1868\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Wilmot, of Pennsylvania, retired from Congress after six years of\r\nservice, March 4, 1851, with his name more generally involved in the\r\npolitical discussion of the country than that of any other of our\r\nstatesmen. He was born in Bethany, Wayne County, Pennsylvania, January\r\n20, 1814, and died in Towanda, March 16, 1868.\r\n\r\nAfter acquiring an academic education wholly by his own efforts he was\r\nadmitted to the bar in Wilkes-Barre in 1834. He at once located at\r\nTowanda, the county seat of Bradford, where he commenced his career and\r\nto which place he brought great and lasting honor.\r\n\r\nHe took a leading part in the support of Van Buren for the presidency in\r\n1836, and in 1844 he was elected to Congress from the Twelfth District,\r\nthen composed of the Counties of Bradford, Susquehanna and Tioga.\r\n\r\nAt that time there existed much friction with Mexico over the boundary\r\nline, also ominous signs of a determined effort to extend slavery beyond\r\nits then existing limits, tariff agitation, trouble with Great Britain\r\nin the Oregon region, and other grave questions of national import.\r\n\r\nThe admission of Texas as a State, March 1, 1845, which was favored by\r\nWilmot and his party, was followed by the war with Mexico a year later.\r\n\r\nA bill was introduced August 8, 1846, which authorized the placing of\r\n$2,000,000 at the disposal of President Polk for the purpose of\r\nnegotiating peace with Mexico and the crucial hour in our history had\r\narrived. The prospect of the erection of future slave States out of\r\nMexican territory aroused the anti-slavery sentiment of the North, and\r\namong the most pronounced of the dozen or more anti-slavery Democrats\r\nwas David Wilmot.\r\n\r\nAt a conference of anti-slavery Democrats was presented what became\r\nknown as the Wilmot proviso, of which the text was a repetition of the\r\nJefferson proviso to the ordinance of 1787, except that it was framed\r\nfor the present situation. The following is the full text: “Provided,\r\nthat as an expressed and fundamental condition to the acquisition of any\r\nterritory from the Republic of Mexico by the United States, by virtue of\r\nany treaty that may be negotiated between them, and to the use by the\r\nExecutive of the moneys herein appropriated, neither slavery nor\r\ninvoluntary servitude shall ever exist in any part of such territory,\r\nexcept for crime whereof the party shall be first duly convicted.”\r\n\r\nWhen offered by Wilmot the proviso produced the utmost consternation in\r\nthe House, as many members had become alarmed at the anti-slavery\r\nsentiment in their districts. The House was in committee of the whole,\r\nand to the surprise of both sides the proviso was adopted by a vote of\r\n83 to 64, the Democrats of the North supporting it with but three\r\nexceptions.\r\n\r\nAn effort was made in the Senate to remove the proviso, but the last day\r\nof the session the gavel fell while the proviso was being debated, the\r\nfirst instance in which a bill was defeated by speaking against time in\r\nthe Senate.\r\n\r\nWilmot was vehemently assailed by most of the leaders of his party, but\r\nthe growing anti-slavery sentiment in the North only served to inspire\r\nWilmot in his great battle, and he developed wonderful power as a public\r\ndisputant.\r\n\r\nWilmot’s contest for re-election in 1848 attracted the attention of the\r\nwhole Nation, and his triumph did much to strengthen the anti-slavery\r\nmovement throughout the North.\r\n\r\nOpposition to the Wilmot Proviso was finally forced as a cardinal\r\ndoctrine of the party. When Wilmot came up for re-election in 1850 he\r\nwas nominated at the Democratic primaries, but the newspapers opposed\r\nhim and his defeat was regarded as one of the first duties of those who\r\ndesired the success of the Democracy against him, and it appeared as if\r\na Whig was sure to be elected.\r\n\r\nConservative Democrats suggested that both the Democratic candidates\r\nwithdraw and select another upon whom all could unite. Wilmot promptly\r\nagreed on condition that the one nominated would sustain his\r\nanti-slavery faith and be personally acceptable to himself. He was asked\r\nto suggest a man, and he named Galusha A. Grow, then a young member of\r\nthe bar in Susquehanna County, who had studied law with him.\r\n\r\nGrow was found by a committee in his mountain retreat and hurried back\r\nto make his battle. He was elected and became the Speaker of Congress in\r\nthe trying days of the Civil War.\r\n\r\nThe year Wilmot retired from Congress he succeeded Hon. Horace Willston\r\non the bench of the judicial district then composed of Bradford,\r\nSusquehanna and Sullivan Counties, and ably served in that capacity\r\nuntil 1857, when he resigned to become a candidate for the governorship\r\nagainst William F. Packer, by whom he was defeated. After his defeat,\r\nWilmot, by appointment of Governor Pollock, resumed his place on the\r\nbench and served until 1861.\r\n\r\nWhen Wilmot cast his lot with the Republican Party he was recognized as\r\na leader in the first national convention in 1856. He was tendered the\r\nnomination as Vice President on the ticket with Fremont, which was\r\ndeclined. He was chairman of the Committee on Resolutions and to him\r\nbelongs the honor of drafting the first platform of the Republican\r\nParty.\r\n\r\nIn the campaign of 1860 Wilmot was a delegate at large and was honored\r\nby being selected as the temporary chairman of that historic body that\r\nnominated Abraham Lincoln.\r\n\r\nWilmot was a candidate for Senator in 1861, but Simon Cameron held the\r\nbalance of power in the contest, and gave the victory to Edgar Cowan.\r\nLater during the same session when Cameron resigned his seat in the\r\nSenate to enter the Cabinet of President Lincoln, as Secretary of War,\r\nWilmot was chosen to succeed him.\r\n\r\nAt the end of his two years’ term the Democrats had carried the\r\nLegislature by one majority and made Charles R. Buckalew, of Columbia\r\nCounty, the Senator. Soon thereafter he was appointed by President\r\nLincoln Judge of the Court of Claims, which position he held until death\r\nterminated his remarkable career.\r\n\r\nHis vigor was much impaired during the last few years of his life by\r\nsteadily failing health, and he was finally able to give but little of\r\nhis time to his judicial duties, and March 16, 1868, he quietly passed\r\naway in his home at Towanda.\r\n\r\nIn the beautiful suburbs of the town may be seen Riverside Cemetery, and\r\nnear the public road stands the simple marble headstone of the grave of\r\nDavid Wilmot, with his name and date of birth and death on the inner\r\nsurface, and on the outer surface, where it can be seen by every\r\npasserby, is inscribed the text of the Wilmot Proviso.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               First Excise Laws of Pennsylvania Enacted\r\n\r\nMarch 17, 1684\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first excise tax in Pennsylvania was imposed by the Assembly of the\r\nProvince March 17, 1684, in an act entitled “Bill for Aid and Assistance\r\nof the Government.”\r\n\r\nThis act seems to have been prompted by a record in the minutes of the\r\nAssembly for February 20, 1684: “The Govr. & Provll Councill have\r\nthought fitt. from the Exteriordinary in the Case, to place Patrick\r\nRobinson as administrator to Benj. Acrods Estate, and to have a recourse\r\nto this board from time to time.\r\n\r\n“Wheras, the Verdict of the Coroner’s Jury was, that Benj. Acrod killed\r\nhimselfe with drinke, wch might give the Province a pretence to his\r\nEstate therin. The Propor & Govr. Relinquished all his Claime thereunto\r\nin Council, and desired ye Council to take Care that some person be\r\nappoynted to take Care of ye Estate of ye sd Acrod, for ye paymt of his\r\ndebts, and the remaineder to be disposed of according to Law, &c.”\r\n\r\nAt the session held on March 26 a bill was read that it should be left\r\nto the Governor and Provincial Council to discuss with Indians matters\r\nconcerning the use of rum among them. Another bill was read which\r\nprohibited bargains being made “when People are in Drinke.” This bill\r\nwas passed.\r\n\r\nThe objectionable features of the first excise bill passed by the\r\nAssembly were soon after repealed and not again renewed until the year\r\n1738, when the Provincial Assembly, August 14, heard a bill “sent by the\r\nHouse of Representatives, entitled an Act for laying an Excise on Wine,\r\nRum, Brandy and other Spirits.” This bill was passed without amendments\r\nand signed by Lieutenant Governor George Thomas, August 25, 1738.\r\n\r\nThis bill proved to be very unpopular, and it remained in force only a\r\nfew months.\r\n\r\nIn 1744 this subject was again revived when at the session of the\r\nProvincial Council held May 25 Lieutenant Governor Thomas in a message\r\nsent to him by the Assembly was advised among other things that “We are\r\nalso of the Opinion that it will be for the Interests of Our\r\nConstituents to make further Provision concerning the Excise Act and we\r\nhave a bill before us to this Purpose; and we hope these Bills, and such\r\nothers as shall be truly useful to the Province, when offered, will meet\r\nwith the Governor’s assent. And we, on our Part, shall then Cheerfully\r\nmake Provision for his Support for the Current Year, equal to any\r\ngranted for the like Time to either of his immediate Predecessors.”\r\n\r\nThis bill proposed an excise tax as a means of providing money without\r\nresorting to a general tax, not only to be used to purchase arms and\r\nammunition for defense, but as well to answer such demands as might be\r\nmade upon the inhabitants of the Province by his Majesty for distressing\r\nthe public enemy in America. This bill, like the former ones, was not\r\nlong in operation.\r\n\r\nMarch 31, 1764, a bill was passed by the Assembly and Council and signed\r\nby Lieutenant Governor John Penn, which tended to suppress “Idleness,\r\nDrunkenness, & other Debaucheries, within this Government.”\r\n\r\nThe attention of the Assembly was once more called to the excise as a\r\nproductive source of revenue on February 24, 1772, when Lieutenant\r\nGovernor Richard Penn laid before the Council a bill sent to him by the\r\nAssembly, entitled “An Act for the support of the Government of this\r\nProvince making the Excise on Wine, Rum, Brandy, and other spirits more\r\nequal, and preventing Frauds in the Collecting and paying the said\r\nExcise.”\r\n\r\nThat a considerable portion of the money expended in the Provincial\r\nGovernment was raised by excise is evidenced from a report made by\r\nGovernor John Penn June 26, 1775, which was an account of the several\r\namounts of the excise tax collected for the years 1771, 72, 73 and 74,\r\nthe total amount of which, after deducting the commissions to the\r\nTreasurer and collectors exceeded £28,000. Together with this report was\r\nanother indorsed “State of the Bills of Credit struck on the Excise for\r\nseveral years, laid before the Governor with the bill for the support of\r\nGovernment & paymt of public debts.”\r\n\r\nIn the Act of 1722 a duty was levied on domestic and foreign spirits. At\r\nfirst, however, as to home-distilled spirits it was not executed, and,\r\nindeed, hardly any steps were taken for the purpose particularly in the\r\nolder counties. But, during the Revolutionary War, the necessities of\r\nthe State and a temporary unpopularity of distillation, owing to the\r\nimmense amount of grain consumed, when the troops so much needed it as a\r\nfood, rendered the collection of duties both necessary and practicable,\r\nand a considerable revenue was thereby obtained. Toward the end of the\r\nwar the act was repealed.\r\n\r\nIn 1780 Congress resolved that an allowance of an additional sum should\r\nbe made to the army, to compensate the troops for the depreciation in\r\ntheir pay. This was distributed among the several States for discharge.\r\nPennsylvania made several appropriations for the purpose, but the\r\nrevenues so applied turned out to be unproductive.\r\n\r\nThe depreciation fund was always favorably regarded, and upon an\r\napplication of officers of the Pennsylvania Line, another effort was\r\nmade, the revenue arising from the excise remaining uncollected was\r\nappropriated to this fund, and vigorous measures were taken for its\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\nGreat changes, however, had taken place in the disposition of the people\r\nsince the first imposition of these duties. The neighboring States were\r\nfree from the burden, and in New Jersey, where a law had been passed for\r\nthe purpose, its execution had been entirely prevented by a powerful\r\ncombination. The Pennsylvania law, therefore, met with great opposition,\r\nespecially west of the Allegheny Mountains and there is no evidence that\r\nthe excise was ever paid in that section.\r\n\r\nThe excise law of Pennsylvania, after remaining for years a dead letter,\r\nwas repealed, and the people were to submit to a similar law passed by\r\nthe Congress of the new Federal Government March 3, 1791. This laid an\r\nexcise of fourpence per gallon on all distilled spirits.\r\n\r\nThe members of Congress from Western Pennsylvania, Smilie, of Fayette,\r\nand Findley, of Westmoreland, stoutly opposed the passage of the law,\r\nand on their return among their constituents loudly and openly\r\ndisapproved of it. Albert Gallatin, then residing in Fayette County,\r\nalso opposed the law by all constitutional methods.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the people in the western counties of the State were of\r\nScotch-Irish descent. They had heard of the exaction and oppression in\r\nthe Old Country under the excise laws—that houses were entered by excise\r\nofficers, the most private apartments examined, and confiscation and\r\nimprisonment followed if the smallest quantity of whisky was discovered\r\nnot marked with the official brand. They also remembered the effective\r\nresistance to the Stamp Act, that those who forced the repeal of the\r\nodious law were the real factors in bringing about the independence of\r\nAmerica. Holding these opinions, it is not to be wondered at that the\r\nmore hot-headed resorted to threats of violence and precipitated the\r\nriotous proceedings known in Pennsylvania history as the Whisky\r\nInsurrection.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Pittsburgh Built in 1760, Incorporated April\r\n                    22, 1794, and Chartered as City\r\n                             March 18, 1816\r\n\r\n\r\nOn April 17, 1754, Ensign Ward was surprised by the appearance of\r\nFrenchmen, who landed, planted their cannon and summoned the English to\r\nsurrender. The French soon demolished an unfinished fort and built in\r\nits place a much larger and better one, calling it Fort Duquesne, in\r\nhonor of the Marquis Duquesne, the French Governor of Canada.\r\n\r\nThis was the actual beginning of what is now Pittsburgh, but there were\r\nmany stirring conflicts for permanent possession of the site at the\r\n“Forks of the Ohio.”\r\n\r\nWhen General John Forbes invested Fort Duquesne November 25, 1758, he\r\nmarched into a place which had been abandoned by the French and instead\r\nof a formidable fortress it was now nothing but a mass of blackened and\r\nsmoldering ruins. The enemy, after burning the barracks and storehouses,\r\nhad blown up the fortifications. Forbes’ first care was to provide a\r\nbetter defense and shelter for his troops, and a strong stockade was\r\nbuilt, which he named Pittsburgh, in honor of England’s great Minister\r\nWilliam Pitt.\r\n\r\nA strong fort was subsequently built, which was known as Fort Pitt, and\r\nwhich continued until after the Revolutionary War to be the western base\r\nof the military department.\r\n\r\nThe first town of Pittsburgh was built near Fort Pitt in 1760. In a very\r\ncarefully prepared list of the houses and the inhabitants outside of the\r\nfort, headed “a return of the number of houses of the names of the\r\nowners and number of the names of the owners and number of men, women\r\nand children in each house Fort Pitt, April 14, 1761,” the number of\r\ninhabitants is 233, with the addition of ninety-five officers, soldiers\r\nand their families residing in the town, making the whole number 328.\r\nThere were 104 houses. The lower town was nearer the fort, the upper on\r\nhigher ground, principally along the bank of the Monongahela, extending\r\nas far as the present Market Street.\r\n\r\nThis town enjoyed comparative quiet until the Pontiac War, in 1763, when\r\nFort Pitt was completely surrounded by the savage foe and the garrison\r\nreduced to dire straits until relieved by Colonel Bouquet.\r\n\r\nThe second town of Pittsburgh was laid out in 1765, by Colonel John\r\nCampbell, by permission of the commandant of Fort Pitt. It comprised the\r\nground bounded by present Water Street, Second and Ferry Streets.\r\nCampbell’s plan of lots was subsequently incorporated unaltered in the\r\nsurvey made by George Woods for the Penns in 1784, and is known as the\r\n“Old Military Plan.” Several of these houses built of hewn logs and\r\nweather-boarded stood until quite recently and the old redoubt of\r\nColonel Bouquet, built in 1764, north of the present Penn Street, west\r\nof Point, remains the most valued relic of the pre-Revolutionary days in\r\nWestern Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe little building is of brick, five-sided, with two floors having a\r\nsquared oak log with loop holes on each floor. There are two underground\r\npassages, one connecting it with the fort, and the other leading to the\r\nMonongahela River. This building and ground upon which it stands is\r\nowned by the Daughters of the American Revolution of Allegheny County,\r\nwho keep it in excellent repair. It was the gift of Mrs. Mary E.\r\nSchenley, April 1, 1894.\r\n\r\nDuring the Revolution the Assembly confiscated the property of the Penn\r\nfamily, excepting certain manors and other property which the\r\nProprietaries held in their private capacities by devise, purchase, or\r\ndescent. The Manor of Pittsburgh contained 5766 acres and included the\r\npresent city of Pittsburgh and the country eastward of it and south of\r\nthe Monongahela; this was surveyed March 27, 1769, and remained as the\r\nproperty of the Penns.\r\n\r\nIn 1784 Tench Francis, of Philadelphia, as agent for the Proprietaries,\r\nlaid out this Manor in town and outlots. The surveyor’s work was done by\r\nGeorge Woods, of Bedford. These lots found ready sale and by 1786 there\r\nwere 100 houses and 500 population. The fur trade was still the most\r\nimportant, although the general business was improving.\r\n\r\nThe first newspaper published west of the Alleghenies was the Pittsburgh\r\nGazette, now the Pittsburgh Gazette-Times, established July 29, 1786.\r\nPittsburgh was incorporated as a borough April 22, 1794.\r\n\r\nAnother important event occurred May 19, 1798, when the galley President\r\nAdams was launched at Pittsburgh. She was the first vessel built here\r\nwhich was competent for a sea voyage, and was constructed by the\r\nGovernment, in preparation for the threatened war with France. The\r\nSenator Ross was launched the following spring.\r\n\r\nThe first glass works were established here in 1797 by James O’Hara and\r\nIsaac Craig. William Eichbaum was brought from near Philadelphia to\r\nsuperintend this new enterprise, the first real manufacturing venture in\r\nthis place. The first paper mill west of the Alleghenies was erected\r\nthis same year in Pittsburgh.\r\n\r\nDuring the three years from 1802 to 1805 four ships, three brigs and\r\nthree schooners were built in Pittsburgh.\r\n\r\nThe first bank in the western part of the State was a branch of the Bank\r\nof Pennsylvania, which opened for business January 1, 1804, on Second\r\nStreet, between Ferry and Chancery Lane. An iron foundry was established\r\nby Joseph McClurg during 1804.\r\n\r\nOn March 24, 1811, the New Orleans, the first steamboat ever built or\r\nrun on Western waters, was launched at Pittsburgh. This boat started on\r\nits initial trip to the Crescent City, December 24 following. The second\r\nsuch boat was christened the Comet and launched in Pittsburgh in 1813. A\r\nlarge number of boats was built in this city, and the trade was immense.\r\n\r\nThe first canal boat ever built or run west of the mountains was the\r\nGeneral Abner Lacock. She was owned by Patrick Leonard, of Pittsburgh,\r\nbut was built in Apollo. This was a fine packet boat, with berths and\r\ndining service, as well as capacity for carrying freight.\r\n\r\nThe first railroad entered Pittsburgh in the fall of 1834, on the\r\ncompletion of the Philadelphia and Columbia, and the Allegheny portage\r\nrailroads.\r\n\r\nPittsburgh became a city by an Act of Assembly at the sessions of\r\n1815–1816, the date of the change in city government being March 18,\r\n1816. At the first election for municipal officers under the City\r\nCharter, Major Ebenezer Denny was chosen Mayor.\r\n\r\nThe first great consolidation was effected March 29, 1872, when the\r\nSouth side was united with Pittsburgh. This brought into the city the\r\nboroughs of Birmingham, East Birmingham, Ormsby, Allentown, St. Clair,\r\nSouth Pittsburgh, Monongahela, Mount Washington, Union, West Pittsburgh\r\nand Temperanceville.\r\n\r\nThe population of Pittsburgh according to the census of 1920 was\r\n588,343.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMargaret Junkin Preston, Poetess-Laureate,| Died March 19, 1897\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of just pride that the most brilliant and beloved poetess\r\nof yesteryear was none other than a Pennsylvania girl, Margaret Junkin\r\nPreston, who through her writings, both in prose and poetry, attained\r\nNation-wide distinction and won the title “Poetess-Laureate of the\r\nSouth.”\r\n\r\nMargaret Junkin was born in Milton, Northumberland County, Pennsylvania,\r\nMay 19, 1820, the eldest child of Rev. George and Julia Rush Miller\r\nJunkin.\r\n\r\nHer parents were of that stalwart, heroic race, the Covenanters of\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\nDr. Junkin’s life was devoted to religion and education, and at the time\r\nof his marriage he was the minister of the Presbyterian Church at\r\nMilton.\r\n\r\nWhen Margaret was ten years old her parents moved to Germantown, where\r\nher father assumed charge of the Manual Labor Academy of Pennsylvania.\r\nAfter a delightful residence of two years Dr. Junkin was called to the\r\nfirst presidency of Lafayette College, and the family moved to the\r\n“Forks of the Delaware.”\r\n\r\nIt was during the incumbency of Dr. Junkin that the college, which for\r\ntwo years was conducted on a farm south of the Lehigh, was moved to the\r\npresent site, on what has since been known as College Hill Easton, and\r\nOld South College built. President and Mrs. Junkin and their seven\r\nchildren moved into the original building, where they continued to\r\nreside until March 30, 1841, when the doctor accepted the presidency of\r\nMiami College, Oxford, O.\r\n\r\nIt was during her residence at Easton that Margaret and her sister,\r\nEleanor, became members of the First Presbyterian Church and that her\r\nfirst productions in verse appeared in the columns of a local newspaper;\r\nthey were “Childhood,” “The Forest Grave” and “Where Dwelleth the Scent\r\nof the Rose.” After her removal to Oxford, O., she wrote “Lines Written\r\non Reading Letters Bringing Sad News From Easton.”\r\n\r\nIn 1844 Dr. Junkin returned to Easton to again assume the presidency of\r\nLafayette College, in which position he capably served until 1848, when\r\nhe accepted the presidency of Washington College, now Washington and Lee\r\nUniversity, at Lexington, Va.\r\n\r\nUpon Margaret Junkin’s return to Easton, she wrote “Love’s Tribute to\r\nthe Departed,” occasioned by the death of an intimate friend, and “The\r\nFate of a Raindrop.” These were followed after removing to Lexington, by\r\n“Thoughts Suggested by Powers’ Proserpine,” “The Old Dominion,” “The\r\nSolaced Grief,” “Galileo Before the Inquisition,” and “The Polish Boy.”\r\n\r\nThe life of Margaret Junkin at Lexington differed from that which she\r\nexperienced as a young girl at Germantown, Easton and Oxford. She had\r\nreached the age of twenty-eight, and the old town in the Shenandoah\r\nValley, with its educational institutions, social atmosphere and local\r\nculture brought many interesting persons as visitors, not to speak of\r\nthe quaint life among the slaves. This all appealed to her. She entered\r\ninto the spirit of this environment to the fullest extent. Her lovely\r\ncharacter, unusual attainments, literary and social, were fully\r\nrecognized at home and abroad.\r\n\r\nThe death, in 1849, of her brother, Joseph, followed by that of her\r\nmother, in 1854, and only a few months later by that of her favorite\r\nsister, Eleanor, brought profound grief to the Junkin household.\r\n\r\nThe sister, Eleanor, survived only a year her marriage to Major Thomas\r\nJ. Jackson, a graduate of West Point, and then a professor in the\r\nVirginia Military Institute, who later achieved fame in the Civil War\r\nand gained the sobriquet of “Stonewall Jackson,” second only to his\r\ncommander-in-chief, Robert E. Lee. After the death of Mrs. Jackson, her\r\nhusband continued to be a member of Dr. Junkin’s household for four\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nMargaret Junkin married, August 3, 1857, Major T. L. Preston, professor\r\nof Latin in the Virginia Military Institute, a widower with seven\r\nchildren. To this family she proved to be an affectionate and devoted\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nTwo sons were born to Major and Margaret Junkin Preston—George Junkin\r\nPreston, for many years a successful specialist in nervous diseases at\r\nBaltimore, now deceased, and Herbert Preston, now General Solicitor for\r\nthe Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company.\r\n\r\nThe war clouds were lowering for a bitter conflict between the North and\r\nSouth, and the Junkin family became divided. The father, Rev. George\r\nJunkin, a pronounced abolitionist and opposed to secession, resigned the\r\npresidency of Washington College, and, with his widowed daughter\r\ndeparted for Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThe story told of this trip, which was made overland, is that when the\r\nMason and Dixon line was reached the team pulling the heavy load of\r\nhousehold effects, and the one attached to the carriage in which the\r\ndoctor and his daughter were riding, were halted, the goods unloaded,\r\nthe horses, harness, wagon, carriage and themselves all carefully\r\nwashed, then again loaded and driven over the boundary line into\r\nPennsylvania. As the doctor afterwards related, no Southern soil should\r\nbe brought into Pennsylvania, he wanted to leave it all where it\r\nbelonged.\r\n\r\nHis son, William, espoused the Southern cause and became a captain, but\r\nhis son, John M., served as a surgeon in the Federal Army.\r\n\r\nFollowing the close of the Civil War, Mrs. Preston devoted much time to\r\nreviewing books for various publishers, and in compiling and arranging\r\nfor publication her own compositions in prose and verse, the latter\r\nresulting in the publication, in 1866, of her “Bechenbrook,” a book of\r\npoems voicing the sorrow and patriotism of the Southern people, and of\r\n“Old Songs and New” in 1870.\r\n\r\nThese were followed by “Cartoons,” “Handful of Monographs,” “For Love’s\r\nSake,” “Colonial Ballads and Sonnets,” “Chimes for Church Children” and\r\n“Aunt Dorothy.” In addition she contributed to Century Magazine in the\r\nearly eighties some reminiscences of General Robert E. Lee, and personal\r\nreminiscences of General “Stonewall” Jackson.\r\n\r\nColonel Preston resigned his professorship in 1882, when he and his\r\ntalented wife traveled and visited among their children. The husband\r\ndied July 15, 1890, and Mrs. Preston continued to live at Lexington for\r\ntwo years, but late in December, 1892, she removed to Baltimore and made\r\nher home with her eldest son, Dr. George Junkin Preston.\r\n\r\nMargaret Junkin Preston died March 19, 1897.\r\n\r\nThere was much written about this poetess at the time, and possibly the\r\nbest known was “An Appreciation of Margaret J. Preston, a Sketch of her\r\nFifty Years of Literary Life,” by Prof. James A. Harrison, of the\r\nUniversity of Virginia.\r\n\r\nMrs. Elizabeth Randolph Preston Allan compiled and published a volume\r\nentitled “The Life and Letters of Margaret Junkin Preston,” and an\r\nexcellent sketch of her interesting life has also been written by Ethan\r\nAllen Weaver, of Germantown, from which much of this story of the\r\n“Poetess-Laureate of the South” has been taken.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Military Laws of Province Repealed by\r\n                       Import Act, March 20, 1780\r\n\r\n\r\nOn March 20, 1780, a law was passed to effect a reorganization of the\r\nwhole militia system in Pennsylvania. It provided for the appointment of\r\na lieutenant for each county, and two sub-lieutenants or more, not\r\nexceeding the number of battalions, which were to be divided into\r\nclasses as heretofore. Fines, however for non-attendance on muster days\r\nwere fixed for commissioned officers at the price of three days’ labor.\r\n\r\nWhen called out, the pay of privates was to be equal to one day’s labor.\r\nPersons called out, but neglecting or refusing to go, were liable to pay\r\nin each case the price of a day’s labor during the term of service,\r\nbeside a tax of fifteen shillings on the hundred pounds upon their\r\nestates. As a relief to this class, the hiring of substitutes was\r\nallowed. Pensions were promised the wounded in battle, and support to\r\nthe families of those militiamen who were killed, at rates to be fixed\r\nby the courts. Considerable opposition was made to this law, from the\r\nfact that by permitting the hiring of substitutes it would relieve the\r\ndisaffected and Tories.\r\n\r\nWhile this bill, undoubtedly, had many defects, it was the first real\r\neffort toward the establishment of a military system in the Commonwealth\r\nupon a practical basis.\r\n\r\nMilitia companies were provided in each county, the State being divided\r\ninto districts, and all males were required to enroll, who were between\r\neighteen and fifty-three years of age.\r\n\r\nThis act was modified in 1783, when a more specific code of discipline\r\nwas adopted. This act remained in force until 1793.\r\n\r\nThe militia act of March 20, 1780, was the outgrowth or development of\r\nthe militia system of Pennsylvania which may be considered to have begun\r\nin the year 1747. Altho in the charter given to William Penn, the\r\nGovernor was given authority to levy, muster and train men, to make war\r\nupon and pursue the enemy, even beyond the limits of the province.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1702, Lieutenant Governor Hamilton asked the Assembly to\r\nenact a bill to provide for “what may come against us by land or by\r\nsea.”\r\n\r\nSeveral years later Lieutenant Governor Evans urged a similar law, but\r\nthe idea was unpopular. Several other similar bills were subsequently\r\ndefeated, yet the Assembly occasionally appropriated funds for “the\r\nKing’s use,” for the purchase of bread, beef, pork, flour, wheat and\r\n“other grain.” Franklin later commented that “other grain” meant black\r\ngrains of gunpowder.\r\n\r\nIt was through the effort and influence of Franklin, in 1747, that a\r\nvolunteer military association was effected, consisting of about 1200 of\r\nthe most influential men in the province. This soon grew to 10,000 and\r\nthe following year the “Associated Companies,” by which name the\r\norganization became known, had enrolled 12,000 horse, foot and\r\nartillery, each armed and equipped at personal expense, and the officers\r\nchosen from the members. Franklin was one of the original colonels.\r\n\r\nThis association rendered conspicuous service in the French and Indian\r\nwars and preserved its organization. Many of the companies volunteered\r\nfor service in the Revolution and formed the backbone of the State’s\r\nmilitia.\r\n\r\nIn 1756 there were in Philadelphia three of these companies, with a\r\ntotal of seventeen officers and 260 private men, one troop of horse with\r\nfive officers and forty men and one battery of artillery with three\r\nofficers and 150 men. In Bucks County there were nine companies with\r\nthirty-nine officers and 513 men; in Chester County there were several\r\ncompanies, under command of Captain John Singleton, Samuel West, Robert\r\nBoyd and Jacob Richardson. In York County there were eight companies\r\nwith an enrollment of 642 men and in Lancaster County there were nine\r\ncompanies and 545 men.\r\n\r\nIt was not until Braddock’s defeat that the Assembly voted a substantial\r\nsum for the “King’s use,” but made no provision for an organized\r\nmilitary force. November 25, 1755, the Assembly passed “an Act for the\r\nbetter ordering and regulating such as are willing and desirous to be\r\nunited for military purposes within the province.”\r\n\r\nThis was the first act of Assembly which in any way provided for the\r\norganized defense of the province, and this was to remain in force only\r\nuntil October 30, 1756.\r\n\r\nBy March 29, 1757, the Quakers had become a minority in the Assembly and\r\nan act was passed which was more satisfactory. It also provided for the\r\ncompulsory enrollment of all male persons between the ages of seventeen\r\nand fifty-five years. It also stated the financial responsibility\r\nrequired of those who would serve as officers.\r\n\r\nOne section of this act provided “that all Quakers, Menonists, Moravians\r\nand others conscientiously scrupulous of bearing arms, who shall appear\r\non any alarm with the militia, though without arms, and obey the\r\ncommands of the officers in extinguishing fires, suppressing\r\ninsurrection of slaves or other evil-minded persons during an attack, in\r\ncaring for the wounded, conveying intelligence as expresses or\r\nmessengers, carrying refreshments to such as are on duty, and in\r\nconveying to places of safety women and children, aged and infirm, and\r\nwounded persons are free and exempt from penalties of this act.” This\r\nact remained in force until the close of the French and Indian War in\r\n1763.\r\n\r\nThere was no special control of military affairs again until June 30,\r\n1775, when the Assembly passed an act for “the defense of their lives,\r\nliberty and property.”\r\n\r\nAt this same session there was established a Committee of Safety, of\r\ntwenty-five members, which constituted the Board of War, whose powers\r\nenabled them to call into service so many of the associators as they\r\ndeemed necessary or the occasion required.\r\n\r\nThe Committee of Safety was organized July 3, 1775, with Benjamin\r\nFranklin as president.\r\n\r\nThis committee exercised supreme control of the land and naval forces of\r\nthe province until October 13, 1777, when its powers were transferred to\r\nthe body known as the Council of Safety, this comprising the Supreme\r\nExecutive Council and nine others. The Council of Safety was dissolved\r\nDecember 6, 1777, when the military authority was assumed by the Supreme\r\nExecutive Council and the Assembly.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate number of men furnished by the Associators during the\r\nRevolution was in excess of 35,000.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania furnished in all arms of the service, under the various\r\ncalls, a total of 120,514 men, which number does not include many bodies\r\nof militia and many men who were under arms for a brief period, a record\r\nof which service was not kept during the early years of the war.\r\n\r\nLaws were passed during the war relating to the military forces, but\r\nthese were all repealed by the formal act of March 20, 1780.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Old Northumberland, Mother of Counties,\r\n\r\nErected March 21, 1772\r\n\r\n\r\nThe political development of Pennsylvania followed closely in the wake\r\nof its expanding settlements. In 1682 the Counties of Philadelphia,\r\nBucks and Chester were formed, with limits intended to include not only\r\nthe populated area, but territory enough in addition to meet for a\r\nconsiderable time to come the growing necessities of the rapidly\r\nincreasing immigration.\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1729, therefore, that the extension of the settlements\r\nand the purchase of new lands from the Indians led to the erection of\r\nLancaster County. At that time the Susquehanna River marked the western\r\nlimit of the land purchased from the Indians in the province. But the\r\npurchase of October 11, 1736, opened a triangular area west of the\r\nriver, which was attached to Lancaster until the convenience of the\r\nincreasing settlements in this region in 1749 demanded the erection of\r\nYork County, and a year later for the erection of Cumberland County.\r\n\r\nThe northern extension of these counties was limited by the Indian\r\nboundary line, marked by the Kittatinny Range.\r\n\r\nAgain the extension of settlements and the treaty of August 22, 1749,\r\ndemanded new county organizations, and in 1752 Berks and Northampton\r\nwere formed to include in their jurisdiction the northern portions of\r\nthe older counties and the newly acquired territory between the Delaware\r\nand Susquehanna Rivers. Berks embraced the larger area.\r\n\r\nAdditional territory west of the Susquehanna was acquired from the\r\nIndians by the treaties of 1754 and 1758, which made the outlying county\r\nof Cumberland too large for the convenience of its inhabitants, and in\r\n1771 Bedford County was erected.\r\n\r\nA similar development was rapidly taking place east of the Susquehanna,\r\noccasioned by the activity about Fort Augusta, at the Forks of the\r\nSusquehanna, and the Pennamite-Yankee War, which was being waged for\r\npossession of the territory in the Wyoming Valley and elsewhere, claimed\r\nby the Susquehanna Company of Connecticut, and the treaty of November 5,\r\n1768, added much new territory.\r\n\r\nBy an act passed March 21, 1772, the County of Northumberland was\r\nerected out of parts of the counties of Lancaster, Cumberland, Berks,\r\nBedford and Northampton. The bounds of the new county stretched to the\r\nNew York-Pennsylvania boundary line on the north and to the Allegheny\r\nRiver on the west, including in its extensive territory the present-day\r\ncounties of Susquehanna, Lackawanna, Luzerne, Wyoming, Bradford,\r\nSullivan, Columbia, Montour, Northumberland, Snyder, Union, Lycoming,\r\nTioga, Potter, Clinton, Cameron, Elk, McKean, Forest, Jefferson, Clarion\r\nand parts of Schuylkill, Center, Mifflin, Juniata, Clearfield, Indiana,\r\nArmstrong, Venango and Warren.\r\n\r\nIt is with eminent propriety this tenth county of Pennsylvania has been\r\nfrequently styled “Old Mother Northumberland,” and each of her\r\ntwenty-nine children refer back to her for their earliest political\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nIts greatest proportions were attained in 1785, when, by the Act of\r\nApril 9, all that part of the purchase of October 22, 1784, east of the\r\nConewango Creek and Allegheny River was placed within its limits. The\r\ncounty thus extended along the northern line of the State as far west as\r\nthe Conewango Creek, which crosses the New York-Pennsylvania boundary\r\nline in Warren County, and from the Lehigh River to the Allegheny River,\r\nwith a maximum width of nearly two-thirds that of the State. The extent\r\nof this region exceeds that of several States of the Union.\r\n\r\nBy the Act of September 24, 1788, Allegheny County was created,\r\nincluding all the territory in the State north and west of the Ohio and\r\nAllegheny Rivers, and from this territory, by act of March 12, 1800, the\r\ncounties of Beaver, Butler, Mercer, Crawford, Erie, Warren, Venango and\r\nArmstrong were erected. Thus it would seem that the first five of these\r\nshould be added with the offspring of Old Northumberland, for three\r\nyears at least. If this be the case her children would number\r\nthirty-four of the sixty-seven counties of the State.\r\n\r\nThe first curtailment of this generous domain resulted from the erection\r\nof Luzerne County, September 25, 1786. West of the Susquehanna the first\r\ncounty to which Northumberland contributed was Mifflin, erected\r\nSeptember 19, 1789, but the part taken from Northumberland with\r\nadditional territory from Northumberland and other counties, was erected\r\ninto Center, February 13, 1800. The formation of Lycoming County, April\r\n13, 1795, deprived Northumberland of the large extent of territory it\r\nhad acquired under the purchase of 1784, with a considerable part of its\r\noriginal area.\r\n\r\nNorthumberland was thus reduced to the position of an interior county.\r\nWith this reduced territory the statesmen of Pennsylvania were not fully\r\nsatisfied, and March 22, 1813, the townships of Chillisquaque and Turbot\r\nwere detached to form part of the new Columbia County, but this was an\r\nunpopular move and the greater part of these townships were re-annexed\r\nto Northumberland, February 21, 1815.\r\n\r\nOn June 16, 1772, the surveyor general was directed to “lay out a town\r\nfor the county of Northumberland, to be called by the name of Sunbury,\r\nat the most commodious place between the fort (Augusta) and the mouth of\r\nShamokin Creek.”\r\n\r\nUntil the court house was built the courts were held at Fort Augusta,\r\nthe first session being held April 9, 1772.\r\n\r\nThe first jail in the county was the dungeon beneath the magazine of\r\nFort Augusta. This is the only part of the early county buildings now in\r\nexistence, and this particular dungeon and the old well which supplied\r\nwater for the garrison are now the property of the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nWhen the county was erected the Governor appointed William Plunket,\r\nTurbut Francis, Samuel Hunter, James Potter, William Maclay, Caleb\r\nGraydon, Benjamin Allison, Robert Moodie, John Lowdon, Thomas Lemon,\r\nEllis Hughes and Benjamin Weiser to be justices. William Plunket was the\r\npresident of the court and served as such four years.\r\n\r\nWilliam Maclay was the Prothonotary and Register and Recorder, and\r\nserved until March 22, 1777; George Nagel, Sheriff of Berks County,\r\nserved in a similar capacity in the new county; Edward Burd was the\r\nState’s attorney, and the Coroner was James Parr. The original County\r\nCommissioners were William Gray, Thomas Hewitt and John Weitzel.\r\nAlexander Hunter was Treasurer, and Walter Clark, Jonathan Lodge, Peter\r\nHosterman, James Harrison, Nicholas Miller, Jacob Heverling and Samuel\r\nWeiser, Assessors; Thomas Lemon, Collector of Excise; Joshua Elder,\r\nJames Potter, Jesse Lukens and William Scull were appointed to run the\r\nboundary line; Samuel Hunter was the first member of the Assembly.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Peter Pence, Indian Fighter, Captured\r\n\r\nMarch 22, 1780\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the conspicuous characters along the Susquehanna Valleys during\r\nthe period of the Revolutionary War, and afterwards, was a Pennsylvania\r\nDutchman by the name of Peter Pence. It is generally believed that his\r\nproper name was Bentz, a name which occurs frequently in Lancaster\r\nCounty, from which place he went to Shamokin. The well-known aptitude of\r\nthe Dutchman to incorrectly sound his letters is given as the reason\r\nthat his name was pronounced and spelled Pence.\r\n\r\nIn accord with the resolution adopted by Congress, June 14, 1775,\r\ndirecting the formation of six companies of expert riflemen in\r\nPennsylvania to be employed as light infantry, one of the companies was\r\nrecruited in Northumberland County, June 25, 1775, under the command of\r\nCaptain John Lowdon.\r\n\r\nCaptain Lowdon then resided on a farm called Silver Spring, adjoining\r\nthe present town of Mifflinburg, Union County, where he died in\r\nFebruary, 1798, aged sixty-eight years.\r\n\r\nThe company formed part of the battalion of riflemen commanded by\r\nColonel William Thompson, of Carlisle. This company boarded boats on the\r\nSusquehanna River and were conveyed to Harris’ Ferry, then marched\r\noverland to Reading, where they arrived July 13, and received knapsacks,\r\nblankets and other equipment. This battalion was composed of nine\r\ncompanies, two from Cumberland County, two from Lancaster, and one each\r\nfrom York and Northumberland, Berks, Bedford and Northampton.\r\n\r\nThe battalion arrived at Cambridge August 7, and soon became the\r\npicketguard of the 2000 provincials there. It also became the First\r\nRegiment of the Continental Line, Colonel Thompson being promoted to\r\nbrigadier general, March 1, 1776. He was succeeded by Colonel Edward\r\nHand, of Lancaster, who also became a brigadier, September 17, 1778.\r\n\r\nThis battalion participated in the Battle of Trenton, was at the taking\r\nof Burgoyne, was with Sullivan in his expedition against the Six Nation\r\nIndians, was at Stony Point under General Wayne and finally served in\r\nthe campaign of South Carolina during the latter days of the war.\r\n\r\nThe first record of Peter Pence is as a private soldier in Lowdon’s\r\ncompany, and the further fact that he served faithfully is sufficient\r\nintroduction to the thrilling life he led in the frontiers of\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\nOn March 22, 1780, the Indians made an attack on some settlers in the\r\nvicinity of Fort Wheeler, on the banks of Fishing Creek, about three\r\nmiles above the present town of Bloomsburg, Columbia County. The Indians\r\nkilled and scalped Cornelius Van Campen and his brother, and a son was\r\ntomahawked, scalped and thrown into the fire. Lieutenant Moses Van\r\nCampen, another son, was taken captive, as was his cousin, a young lad,\r\nand Peter Pence. Soon after this, at another place, the Indians took a\r\nlad named Jonah Rogers and a man named Abram Pike.\r\n\r\nWith their captives the Indians made their way over the mountains, into\r\nwhat is now Bradford County. The savage warriors were ten in number.\r\n\r\nOne evening, while the prisoners were being bound for the night, an\r\nIndian accidentally dropped his knife close to Van Campen’s feet, and he\r\ncovered the knife unobserved.\r\n\r\nAbout midnight, when the warriors were all asleep, Van Campen got the\r\nknife and released Peter Pence, who in turn released the others.\r\nCautiously and quickly the weapons were obtained and a plan of action\r\ndetermined. The prisoners had been placed in the midst of the warriors.\r\nVan Campen and Pike were to use the tomahawk on one group, while Peter\r\nPence opened fire on the other with the rifles.\r\n\r\nThe work was well done, Van Campen and Pike dispatched four while Pence,\r\nwith unerring aim speedily killed his group. A hand to hand fight\r\nbetween the remaining Indian, John, a Mohawk sachem, and Van Campen,\r\nresulted in the Indian making his escape.\r\n\r\nThe liberated captives scalped the Indians, picked up their plunder and\r\nhastily constructed a raft, and, after a series of adventures, reached\r\nWyoming, April 4, 1780, where Pike and young Rogers left the party.\r\nPeter Pence and the Van Campens reached Fort Jenkins on the morning of\r\nApril 6, where they found Colonel John Kelly, with 100 frontiersmen who\r\nhad hurried there from the West Branch. The following day Pence and Van\r\nCampen reached Fort Augusta, where they were received in a regular\r\nfrontier triumph.\r\n\r\nThe next exploit in which we find Pence engaged is in the year 1781,\r\nwhen one of the most atrocious murders was committed near Selinsgrove.\r\n\r\nThree brothers by the name of Stock were at work in the field when a\r\nparty of about thirty Indians appeared. They did not attack the boys,\r\nbut passed on to the house, which they entered. On the way they found\r\nanother son plowing, whom they killed. Mrs. Stock and a daughter-in-law\r\nwere found in the house. The mother defended herself with a canoe pole,\r\nas she retreated toward the field where her husband was working. She was\r\ntomahawked, however, the house plundered and the young woman carried\r\ninto the woods nearby and killed and scalped. When Stock returned and\r\nfound his wife, son and daughter-in-law inhumanly butchered he gave an\r\nalarm.\r\n\r\nThree experienced Indian fighters, Michael Grove, John Stroh and Peter\r\nPence went in pursuit of the enemy. They found them encamped on the\r\nNorth Branch, on the side of a hill covered with fern. Grove crept close\r\nenough to discover that their rifles were stacked around a tree and that\r\nall but three were asleep.\r\n\r\nOne of the Indians was narrating in high glee how Mrs. Stock defended\r\nherself with the pole. Grove lay quiet until all the Indians fell\r\nasleep. He then returned to his companions, Stroh and Pence. They\r\ndecided to attack, and crept up close to the camp, when they dashed\r\namong the sleeping savages. Grove plied his deadly tomahawk, while Stroh\r\nand Pence seized the rifles and fired among the sleepers. Several\r\nIndians were killed; the others, believing they were attacked by a large\r\nparty fled to the woods.\r\n\r\nA captive white boy was liberated and the three brave men brought home a\r\nnumber of scalps and the best rifles.\r\n\r\nMarch 10, 1810, the Legislature passed an act granting an annuity to\r\nPeter Pence, in consideration of his services, of $40 per annum. He died\r\nin the Nippenose Valley, in 1812. He left several sons and daughters.\r\nRobert Hamilton, of Pine Creek Township, Clinton County, was the\r\nexecutor of his estate. He left a will which is recorded in Lycoming\r\nCounty.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              John Bartram, First Great American Botanist\r\n                  and Founder of Bartram Gardens, Born\r\n                        at Darby, March 23, 1699\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not generally known, at least outside of Pennsylvania, that that\r\nState was the birth place of a man whom the celebrated Linnaeus\r\npronounced the greatest natural botanist in the world. This man was John\r\nBartram, a native of Delaware County.\r\n\r\nAugust 30, 1685 John Bartram bought three hundred acres of land from\r\nThomas Brassey, which land was situated along Darby Creek, in now\r\nDelaware County. Here John Bartram was born March 23, 1699.\r\n\r\nHis early attention was first directed to botanical studies by one of\r\nthose accidents which seem to shape the destinies of all great men.\r\n\r\nWhen a mere lad and helping his father with the work about the farm he\r\nplowed up a daisy. Despite everything the modest little flower kept\r\nintruding itself on his consideration, until after several days he hired\r\na man to plow while he rode to Philadelphia to procure a treatise on\r\nbotany and a Latin grammar.\r\n\r\nFortunately for himself and the world he inherited a farm from a\r\nbachelor uncle, which gave him the means to marry early, and purchase\r\nthe land where he afterwards established the noted “Botanical Gardens.”\r\nHis wife was Mary, daughter of Richard and Elizabeth Maris; they were\r\nmarried April 25, 1723. Mrs. Bartram died within a few years, and he\r\nthen married Ann Mendenhall, February 11, 1729.\r\n\r\nBartram bought his piece of ground at Gray’s Ferry in 1728. On this\r\nestate he built with his own hands a stone house, and on one of the\r\nstones in the gable was cut “John * Ann Bartram, 1731.”\r\n\r\nHere he pursued his studious habits, his reputation spreading abroad\r\nuntil correspondence was solicited by the leading botanists of the Old\r\nWorld,—Linnaeus, Dr. Fothergill, and others,—while in the colonies, all\r\nscientific men in the same line of study sought his favor, advice and\r\nopinions. Dr. Benjamin Franklin was his earnest friend, and constantly\r\nurged Bartram to authorship.\r\n\r\nHis fame had so extended that in 1765 King George III appointed him\r\nbotanist to the King.\r\n\r\nHe transmitted both his talents and tastes to his son William, and their\r\njoint labors during a period of nearly one hundred years were the most\r\nvaluable contributions that this country has made to the science in\r\nwhose behalf they were devoted.\r\n\r\nThey were pious Quakers, admired and loved by their acquaintances.\r\n\r\nJames Logan was probably the first person who directed the mind of John\r\nBartram seriously to botany as the pursuit of a lifetime.\r\n\r\nLogan was a lover of plants and flowers and enjoyed a wonderful garden\r\nat “Stenton,” and Bartram was a welcome guest.\r\n\r\nLogan, in 1729, sent to England for a copy of “Parkinson’s Herbal,”\r\nsaying he wanted to present it to John Bartram, who was a person\r\nworthier of a heavier purse than fortune had yet allowed him, and had “a\r\ngenius perfectly well turned for botany.”\r\n\r\nA subscription was started in 1742 to enable Bartram to travel in search\r\nof botanical specimens. It was proposed to raise enough for him to\r\ncontinue his travels for three years, he being described as a person who\r\n“has had a propensity to Botanicks from his infancy,” and “an accurate\r\nobserver, of great industry and temperance, and of unquestionable\r\nveracity.”\r\n\r\nThe result of these travels was the publication of two very delightful\r\nbooks by this earliest of American botanists.\r\n\r\nThe specimens he collected were sent to Europe, where they attracted\r\nKahn and many other naturalists to this country.\r\n\r\nIn 1751 he published his work, “Observations on the Inhabitants,\r\nClimate, Soil, Divers Productions, Animals, etc., made in his Travels\r\nfrom Pennsylvania to Onondaga, Oswego, and the Lake Ontario.” In 1766\r\nappeared “An Account of East Florida, by William Stork, with a Journal\r\nkept by John Bartram, of Philadelphia, upon a Journey from St.\r\nAugustine, Fla., up the River St. John’s.”\r\n\r\nHe also contributed numerous papers to the Philosophical Transactions\r\nfrom 1740 to 1763.\r\n\r\nHe was the first in this country to form a botanical garden.\r\n\r\nOn the outside of his house, over the front window of his study, was a\r\nstone with the inscription, carved by his own hand:\r\n\r\n                   “’Tis God alone, Almighty God,\r\n                   The Holy One, by me Adored.\r\n                                John Bartram, 1770;”\r\n\r\nand an inscription over the door of his greenhouse was:\r\n\r\n             “Slave to no sect, who takes no private road,\r\n             But looks through nature up to Nature’s God.”\r\n\r\nAs the British soldiers were approaching Philadelphia from the Battle of\r\nBrandywine, John Bartram greatly feared they would destroy his “beloved\r\ngarden,” the work of a lifetime. He became very much excited, and said,\r\n“I want to die!” and expired half an hour later, September 22, 1777. His\r\nremains lie buried in the Friends’ burying ground, Darby.\r\n\r\nHis son William went to Florida to study and collect botanical\r\nspecimens, returning home in 1771. In 1773, at the instance of the\r\ndistinguished Quaker physician, Dr. John Fothergill, of London, William\r\nspent five years in the study of the natural productions of the Southern\r\nStates. The results of these investigations were published by Dr.\r\nFothergill.\r\n\r\nIn 1782 he was elected Professor of Botany in the University of\r\nPennsylvania, but declined the appointment on the score of ill health.\r\n\r\nBesides his discoveries and publications on botany, he prepared the most\r\ncomplete table of American ornithology prior to Wilson’s great work, and\r\nhe was an assistant of the latter in a portion of his work.\r\n\r\nHe died suddenly, July 22, 1823, just a moment after he had completed\r\nwriting a sketch of a new specimen of a plant.\r\n\r\nThis first botanical garden in America is situated in West Philadelphia,\r\nnear Fifty-fourth Street and Woodland Avenue. There is a cider mill, and\r\nclose by the grave of an old and faithful slave.\r\n\r\nThe house is sufficient to attract any visitor, and it was here where\r\nthe illustrious visitors from various parts of the world were received\r\nby the Bartrams.\r\n\r\nThe city authorities assumed control of this property in 1891.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n           Proposal for Second Constitution for Pennsylvania\r\n                         Adopted March 24, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776 proving inadequate for the\r\nrequirements of a useful and effective Government, its revision was\r\ndemanded. On March 24, 1789, the Assembly adopted resolutions\r\nrecommending the election of delegates to form a new Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe struggle for independence had been fought and won, but with the\r\ntriumph of the Revolution even those who had been opposed to the\r\nmovement speedily acquiesced, though many years elapsed before all the\r\nbitter memories engendered by the strife could pass away. Time was\r\nhealing the wounds of war, and others were growing up who had not\r\nsuffered.\r\n\r\nThe adoption of the Federal Constitution had rendered the institution of\r\nmeasures necessary for the election of members of Congress and electors\r\nof President and Vice President of the United States. In order to avail\r\nthemselves as fully as possible of the privileges afforded, the\r\nAnti-Federalists were early at work.\r\n\r\nA few of the leading men of this party assembled in convention at\r\nHarrisburg in September, 1788, ostensibly for the purpose of\r\nrecommending revision of the new Constitution. Blair McClenachen was\r\nchosen as the chairman of this small assembly, and General John A.\r\nHanna, secretary. They resolved that it was expedient to recommend an\r\nacquiescence in the Constitution but that a revision of the instrument\r\nwas necessary. They debated among other topics, a reform in the ratio of\r\ncongressional representation, and a referendum on the term of a Senator.\r\nSeveral other changes were advocated, but the body contented itself by\r\nnominating a general ticket for Congress.\r\n\r\nThe action of this body was immediately denounced and as the nominees\r\nwere Anti-Federalists, it was said that power to enforce the new\r\nconstitutional system ought not to be granted to its opponents.\r\n\r\nA new convention was to meet at Lancaster, which selected candidates for\r\nCongress and electors for President. The election took place in\r\nNovember, and in the State six of the nominees on the Federal ticket\r\nwere elected and two (David Muhlenberg, of Montgomery, and Daniel\r\nHiester, of Berks), who, although Federalists, had with two others of\r\nthe same politics, been placed as a matter of policy with the opposition\r\nticket.\r\n\r\nThe political condition of Pennsylvania had undergone a great change,\r\nand now the three original counties had multiplied by 1790 to\r\ntwenty-one. Immigration was strongly flowing into the State. The\r\nabundance of fertile lands formed an attraction to the immigrant almost\r\nwithout parallel in the county.\r\n\r\nThen the Constitution of 1776 had been rather hastily prepared amid\r\ngreat excitement and was adopted with the determined spirit that\r\ncharacterized all public measures during the Revolutionary period.\r\n\r\nEven though the instrument had become somewhat antiquated, it might have\r\nbeen improved by regular methods, and the amended Constitution would\r\nhave been acceptable to a large number of people, but such action would\r\nnot have served the personal ambitions of the leaders.\r\n\r\nThe chief objections to the Constitution were the single legislative\r\nbody, and a Council of Censors whose functions were of such an unusual\r\ncharacter, the latter body being the real bone of contention.\r\n\r\nWhen the people had grown discontented with the old Constitution,\r\nbelieving they had suffered long enough through lack of action and\r\nauthority, they were willing to adopt another Constitution containing\r\nthe principles of enduring life.\r\n\r\nThe same movement that led to the ratification of the Federal\r\nConstitution by Pennsylvania stirred the waters in another direction. If\r\nthe Federal Constitution could be ratified by a convention, why could\r\nnot a convention be called to make and adopt another Constitution for\r\nPennsylvania?\r\n\r\nA petition was addressed to the Legislature, which adopted a resolution\r\nMarch 24, 1789, but the Supreme Executive Council refused to promulgate\r\nthis action of the Assembly.\r\n\r\nSeptember 15, 1789, the Assembly adopted another resolution calling for\r\na convention by a vote of 39 to 17.\r\n\r\nAt the election in October delegates were chosen, and on Tuesday,\r\nNovember 24, 1789, the convention assembled in Philadelphia, but a\r\nquorum not being present, the organization was effected the following\r\nday with sixty-four delegates in attendance. No returns had been\r\nreceived from the counties of Northumberland and Allegheny, and Mifflin\r\nhad sent a double delegation.\r\n\r\nThomas Mifflin was chosen president; Joseph Redman, secretary; Frederick\r\nSnyder, messenger, and Joseph Fry, doorkeeper.\r\n\r\nOn the Republican side, those in favor of a new constitution were James\r\nWilson, Thomas McKean and Thomas Mifflin, all of Philadelphia; Timothy\r\nPickering, of Luzerne; Edward Hand, of Lancaster. Among the\r\nConstitutionalists were William Findley, of Westmoreland; John Smilie\r\nand Albert Gallatin, of Fayette; Robert Whitehill and William Irvine, of\r\nCumberland.\r\n\r\nAfter a long session the convention adjourned Friday, February 26, 1790,\r\nto meet Monday, August 9.\r\n\r\nThe second session of the convention met pursuant to adjournment and got\r\ndown to business the third day, and concluded its work by the final\r\nadoption of a new instrument September 2, 1790, the final vote being\r\nsixty-one to one, Mr. George Roberts, of Philadelphia, voting against\r\nits adoption.\r\n\r\nThe most radical changes were made in the executive and legislative\r\nbranches of government. The Assembly ceased to have the sole right to\r\nmake laws, a Senate being created. The Supreme Executive Council was\r\nabolished. A Governor was directed to be elected to whom the\r\nadministration of affairs was to be entrusted.\r\n\r\nThe former judicial system was continued, excepting that the judges of\r\nthe higher courts were to be appointed during good behavior, instead of\r\nseven years. The Bill of Rights re-enacted the old Provincial provision\r\ncopied into the first Constitution, respecting freedom of worship and\r\nthe rights of conscience. The Council of Censors ceased to have\r\nauthority and Pennsylvania conformed in all important matters to the\r\nsystem upon which the new Federal Government was to be administered.\r\n\r\nThe first election held under the Constitution of the Commonwealth, that\r\nof 1790, resulted in the choice of Thomas Mifflin, the president of the\r\nconvention, which made, adopted and proclaimed the Constitution, for\r\nGovernor. He served three terms.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 David Lewis, Robber and Counterfeiter,\r\n                          Born March 25, 1790\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Lewis was the most notorious robber and counterfeiter in this\r\ncountry a little more than a century ago.\r\n\r\nHe was born at Carlisle, March 25, 1790, of poor, but respectable\r\nparents, being one of a large family of children. The father died when\r\nDavid was less than ten years old, and the widow had a hard struggle to\r\nraise her family. Be it said to the credit of David that he remained\r\nwith her and assisted in raising the family until he was seventeen years\r\nold. Then he worked at different occupations in and about Bellefonte\r\nuntil he enlisted in the army.\r\n\r\nDuring this service he was punished by a sergeant for some offense and\r\ndeserted, only to re-enlist a few months later, as a private in Captain\r\nWilliam N. Irvine’s company of light artillery, under an assumed name.\r\n\r\nBy this time he had formed vicious habits and he immediately planned to\r\ndecamp with his bounty money, but he was discovered as a former\r\ndeserter. The War of 1812 was imminent and discipline rigid, so that the\r\nsentence of his court martial was death. Through the efforts of his\r\ndistressed mother, his sentence was commuted to imprisonment in a guard\r\nhouse, secured by ball and chain.\r\n\r\nHe served only one week of this sentence, for he then made his escape\r\nand safely reached a cave on the banks of the Conodoguinet Creek, less\r\nthan two miles from Carlisle. The very night he arrived in this favorite\r\nhaunt Lewis began his long and varied career of robbery and lawlessness.\r\nThis cave and another on Little Chickies Creek near Mount Joy, Lancaster\r\nCounty, were the storehouses for the major portion of the ill-gotten\r\nloot of Lewis and his gang.\r\n\r\nThe first victims of Lewis were the country banks, but recently\r\nestablished and whose bank notes were easy to counterfeit. Lewis was\r\nquick to make the most of this condition. He journeyed to Vermont and\r\nthere made enormous quantities of spurious bank bills, purporting to\r\nhave been issued from banks in Philadelphia and various Pennsylvania\r\ntowns. These were successfully passed in New York.\r\n\r\nLewis was captured and committed to jail at Troy, from which he soon\r\nescaped, with the assistance of the jailer’s daughter, who fled with him\r\nand became his wife. His devotion to her was so genuine that it is\r\nstrange her influence did not prove sufficient for him to have become a\r\nvaluable member of society instead of one of the worst criminals on\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\nLewis was a man of unusual physical strength, handsome, and possessed a\r\nmost pleasing personality. He was conscious of that fact, and made many\r\nfriends, not in crime, but those who would aid him in making escape or\r\ngive him timely warning. The story is told of Nicholas Howard, a\r\nprominent landlord near Doubling Gap, who would display a flag from a\r\ncertain upper window when the coast was clear, and Lewis was thus\r\nadvised of the movements of the officers seeking his apprehension. Food\r\nwas often carried to him in his hiding place by those who never\r\nsuspected they were befriending an outlaw.\r\n\r\nA Mr. Black, of Cumberland, Md., related a personal adventure with Lewis\r\nin the Allegheny Mountains. Black had crossed the mountain on horseback\r\nto Brownsville, where he collected a large sum of money. He rode a\r\nspeedy black horse. While in Brownsville he won another horse in a race\r\nand the following day started home, riding the new horse, leading his\r\nown “Blacky.”\r\n\r\nIn a lonely ravine a man suddenly appeared and jumped on Blacky’s back\r\nand rode alongside Black and began to barter for the horse. The horse\r\nwas not for sale and they rode together until a spring was reached,\r\nwhere they dismounted and quenched their thirst and ate a bite and drank\r\nsome peach brandy. By the time a second spring was reached Black and his\r\nnew-found companion were on intimate terms. The stranger asked Black if\r\nhe had ever seen Lewis, about whom there was so much fear and\r\nexcitement. He replied that he had not.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” replied the stranger, jumping to his feet, “here is Lewis—I\r\nam the man.”\r\n\r\nBlack further stated that Lewis told him he had seen the race in\r\nBrownsville and knew he had collected much money there, and that he had\r\npreceded him to waylay and rob him, but that Black had treated him like\r\na gentleman and he would not harm him or take a cent from his pocket.\r\n\r\nAt another time when a large searching party in Adams County in pursuit\r\nof Lewis met a well-dressed stranger on horseback, they asked him if he\r\nhad “seen or heard anything of Lewis, the robber.” He replied that he\r\nhad not and joined in the pursuit. Later he had the audacity to send a\r\nletter stating that they had been riding with Lewis, and he was anxious\r\nto learn if they had thought him an agreeable companion.\r\n\r\nOne of the best of his exploits took place in Mifflin County. Having\r\nfailed in the execution of some plots to rob several wealthy farmers,\r\nhis ready cash uncomfortably low, he set out to replenish his finances.\r\nComing across a fine, large house that stood back from the highway, he\r\nknocked at the door, which was opened by an elderly woman of respectable\r\nappearance. Lewis, to ascertain where her money was kept, asked her to\r\nchange a five dollar note.\r\n\r\n“That I am not able to do,” replied the woman, “for I am unfortunate and\r\nhave not a dollar in the house, and what is worse,” she added\r\ndespondently, as she caught sight of a man coming through the woods\r\ntoward the house, “there comes the constable to take my cow for the last\r\nhalf-year’s rent. I don’t know what to do without her.”\r\n\r\n“How much do you owe?” inquired Lewis, hurriedly.\r\n\r\n“Twenty dollars, sir,” answered the woman.\r\n\r\n“Have you no one to help you?” inquired Lewis.\r\n\r\n“No one,” she replied.\r\n\r\n“Then I will,” said the robber, as he drew from his pocket the exact\r\nsum. “Pay that fellow his demand and be sure to take his receipt, but\r\ndon’t say anything about me.”\r\n\r\nLewis had just time to make his escape, unobserved, when the constable\r\narrived and proceeded to drive away the widow’s cow, but she rushed\r\nforward, paid him the money and took his receipt.\r\n\r\nHe immediately set out upon his return, but had not proceeded far, when\r\nLewis bounded into the road and greeted him as follows:\r\n\r\n“How d’ye do, stranger? Got any spare change about you?”\r\n\r\n“No,” answered the frightened constable.\r\n\r\n“Come, shell out, old fellow, or I’ll save you the trouble,” retorted\r\nLewis, as he presented his pistol. This argument convinced the worthy\r\nofficial that the stranger meant business and he quickly handed over his\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nLewis got back his twenty dollars and forty dollars in addition. He\r\noften afterward boasted that the loan of that twenty to the widow was\r\none of the best investments he ever made.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             More Exploits of Lewis, the Robber—Conclusion\r\n\r\nof Yesterday’s Story, March 26\r\n\r\n\r\nYesterday’s story was a brief outline of the early life of David Lewis,\r\nthe robber and counterfeiter, and in this will be told those events\r\nwhich followed and ended in his death.\r\n\r\nIn 1818, Dr. Peter Shoenberger, owner of the Huntingdon Furnace, in\r\nHuntingdon County, had made extensive shipments of iron to Harper’s\r\nFerry and prepared to cross the mountains to receive his pay. Lewis and\r\nhis band knew of this proposed trip and determined to waylay and rob\r\nhim. The sum to be collected amounted to more than $13,000, and the\r\nironmaster’s credit would be ruined if this sum was not in deposit in\r\nBellefonte by a certain date.\r\n\r\nWhile they were scheming to rob Shoenberger news reached them that their\r\nvictim was returning home by way of the Cumberland Valley and\r\nHarrisburg.\r\n\r\nWhen Lewis and his gang arrived at Harrisburg they learned that the\r\ndoctor, warned of their designs, had again changed his route, but the\r\nhighwaymen knew the country and soon got in advance of their victim. In\r\nthe early hours of the morning, a few miles east of Bellefonte, the\r\ndoctor was confronted by a large man on horseback, who, with a pistol in\r\nhand, ordered him to “stand and deliver.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor was in a dilemma; he faced financial ruin or loss of life. As\r\nhe reached for his saddlebag he heard a shout and at the same time saw\r\nthe top of a Conestoga wagon reaching the top of the hill. The wagoners\r\nwere encouraging their horses as the doctor yelled in desperation, “Men,\r\nI am being robbed. Help! Help!”\r\n\r\nLewis snapped his pistol, but it failed to discharge. Connelly, a mate\r\nof Lewis, rode up and would have killed the doctor, but for Lewis. A\r\nshot by one of the wagoners struck Connelly in the shoulder, but he and\r\nLewis escaped in the woods.\r\n\r\nDuring his operations in New York City Lewis formed a partnership with\r\nother noted crooks. Each one signed an ironclad compact with blood drawn\r\nfrom the veins of each member as they formed in a circle, while Lewis\r\nheld a basin to receive the blood of each, which was used as ink.\r\n\r\nLewis knew that Mrs. John Jacob Astor was to attend a well-advertised\r\nauction sale, where she made many purchases of rare laces and jewelry,\r\nplacing them in a reticule, which she kept on a bench close by her side.\r\nWhile she was engaged in conversation, Lewis stole the bag and made his\r\nescape. He failed to divide the plunder with the gang, but gave it all\r\nto his wife, barely escaping their wrath.\r\n\r\nLewis headed for Princeton, where, he said, he found “empty heads and\r\nfull purses.” He succeeded in fleecing many of the students of all the\r\nmoney they had or could obtain.\r\n\r\nHis next exploits were in Philadelphia, where he was the leader of a\r\nband which attempted to decoy Stephen Girard out of the city into the\r\ncountry, to keep him in confinement until forced to purchase his\r\nfreedom. They also planned to dig a tunnel from the Dock Street sewer to\r\nGirard’s banking house, where they intended to reach the bank vaults\r\nfrom below. The dangerous illness of Lewis’ daughter caused a delay in\r\nthese plans, his gang drifted apart, and the scheme was abandoned.\r\n\r\nHe then drove a team in the United States Army, where he robbed officers\r\nand men. When he received his pay for his services and for his\r\nemployer’s teams and wagons, he stole the entire proceeds and left for\r\nWestern Pennsylvania, where he was most active and successful in his\r\nnefarious pursuit.\r\n\r\nHis wife died about this time and his grief was so genuine that he\r\nalmost changed his mode of life, but soon fell in with another gang and\r\nfor some time devoted his attention to making and circulating spurious\r\nmoney. He was caught passing bad money and arrested at Bedford and\r\nsentenced to the penitentiary, from which he was pardoned by Governor\r\nFindlay.\r\n\r\nLewis and his band robbed a Mr. McClelland, who was riding from\r\nPittsburgh to Bedford. Lewis saved McClelland’s life when Connelly\r\ninsisted on shooting him, saying “Dead men tell no tales.” Lewis was\r\nagain caught and confined in the Bedford jail. He not only escaped, but\r\nhe set free all the convicts who entered in the plan with him, leaving\r\nbehind “an ordinary thief who had robbed a poor widow. Such a thief\r\nshould remain in jail and pay the price,” wrote Lewis in his confession.\r\n\r\nLewis and Connelly made a trip through York and Cumberland Counties\r\nrobbing wealthy German farmers. A well-laid plot to rob a wealthy Mr.\r\nBashore was frustrated through the presence of mind and bravery of his\r\nwife, who blew a horn to alarm the neighborhood, as Lewis confessed,\r\n“displaying as much courage as any man and more resolution than any\r\nwoman I had met with.”\r\n\r\nOn several occasions he was known to have risked capture, and even his\r\nlife, just to spend a few hours with his mother, whom he dearly loved.\r\n\r\nLewis learned that a wagon load of merchandise belonging to Hamilton and\r\nPage, of Bellefonte, was expected to pass through the Seven Mountains.\r\nHe and his gang quickly planned and successfully executed this robbery,\r\nand immediately thereafter made a rich haul from the store of General\r\nJames Potter, in Penn’s Valley near the Old Fort.\r\n\r\nLewis was a shrewd mountaineer and smart as a steel trap, but like all\r\nsuch criminals of his daring was sure to meet his fate. Even though\r\nfrequently arrested and confined in jail, none was strong enough to hold\r\nhim. He never served a sentence in a single institution.\r\n\r\nAfter the robbery of General Potter’s store, Lewis and Connelly started\r\nfor Sinnemahoning, meeting at the house of Samuel Smith, where they\r\nparticipated in shooting at a mark, and mingled in the crowd. Lewis and\r\nConnelly were recognized and their surrender demanded as rewards were\r\neverywhere offered for their arrest. Connelly opened fire, killing one\r\nof the captors.\r\n\r\nLewis, never having taken life, snapped his pistol in the air, but the\r\nfire was returned in earnest, Lewis being shot in the right arm and\r\nConnelly in the hip. The latter was found hiding in a tree top. Lewis\r\nand Connelly were loaded in canoes and taken down the river to Great\r\nIsland, now Lock Haven, where three physicians attended them. Connelly\r\ndied that night. Lewis was removed, as soon as his wounds would permit\r\nto Bellefonte jail, where he died a month later, July 13, 1820.\r\n\r\nThus a sad commentary in the life of Lewis, the Robber, that the only\r\njail from which he failed to escape was the Bellefonte bastile, and\r\nwhile there his wounds were of such a nature he could not plan nor did\r\nhe desire to escape, but he often told his jailer he could easily get\r\naway any hour he pleased.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Bethlehem Hospital Base During Revolution,\r\n                          Moved March 27, 1777\r\n\r\n\r\nBethlehem was the seat of a general hospital twice during the Revolution\r\nand during the six years from 1775 to 1781, it was a thoroughfare for\r\nContinental troops. Heavy baggage and munitions of war and General\r\nWashington’s private baggage were stored in the town and guarded by 200\r\nContinentals under command of Colonel William Polk, of North Carolina,\r\nwhile many houses were occupied by American troops and British prisoners\r\nof war. The Continental Congress found refuge there when on its flight\r\nfrom Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Bethlehem, therefore, witnessed not only the horrors\r\nand experienced the discomforts of war, but also its “pomp and\r\ncircumstance,” for at times there were sojourning among them Generals\r\nWashington, Lafayette, Greene, Knox, Sterling, Schuyler, Gates,\r\nSullivan, De Kalb, Steuben, Pulaski and Arnold, with members of their\r\nstaffs, and General Charles Lee’s division of the army in command of\r\nGeneral Sullivan was encamped opposite the town.\r\n\r\nThe population of Bethlehem in those stirring days was about 500 souls,\r\nprincipally Moravians. The “Church Store,” on Market Street, was well\r\nstocked and spacious; in its cellars were stored supplies for the\r\nhospital and in the dwelling part sick and wounded soldiers found\r\ndesirable quarters.\r\n\r\nThe dwelling of Thomas Horsfield was nearby. He was a hero of the French\r\nand Indian War, a colonel of the Provincial forces and a magistrate.\r\nMany refugees from Philadelphia and New York were provided a temporary\r\nhome by the old veteran. Beyond, to the west, resided William Boehler,\r\nwhere Captain Thomas Webb, the founder of Methodism in America, and a\r\nBritish prisoner of war with his family of seven persons, were\r\ncomfortably accommodated.\r\n\r\nOn what is now Main Street, and north of the “Brethren House,” stood the\r\n“Family House,” for married people, in which were confined more than 200\r\nBritish prisoners, whose guard of 100 Continentals were quartered in the\r\nwater works building. When they marched for Reading and Lancaster, the\r\nsurgeons of the hospital occupied the building.\r\n\r\nFarther up the thoroughfares were the farm buildings and dwelling of\r\nFrederick Boeckel, the farmer general of the Moravian estates, where\r\nLafayette, after being wounded at Brandywine, was tenderly nursed to\r\nconvalescence by Dame Barbara Boeckel and her pretty daughter, Liesel.\r\n\r\nThe last house overlooking the Valley of the Monocacy was the Sun Inn, a\r\nhostelry unsurpassed in the Colonies, and surely none other entertained\r\nand sheltered so many of the patriots of the American Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe Single Brethren’s House now the middle building of the Moravian\r\nSeminary and College for Women, which has weathered the storms of more\r\nthan 175 years, was twice during the Revolution occupied as a general\r\nhospital, the first time from December, 1776, to April, 1777, and for\r\nthe last time from September, 1777, to April, 1778. The cornerstone of\r\nthis large building was laid April 1, 1748.\r\n\r\nThe Americans were defeated at Long Island in August, 1776, when\r\nWashington withdrew his troops to New York City, which a few days later\r\nfell into the hands of the enemy. This loss was quickly followed by that\r\nof Fort Washington and Fort Lee, when Washington crossed the North River\r\ninto New Jersey, and continued his retreat to Trenton, in which he was\r\nclosely pursued by Cornwallis. It was at this crisis that the general\r\nhospital, in which more than 1,000 sick and wounded were living, was\r\nremoved from Morristown to Bethlehem.\r\n\r\nOn December 3, 1776, Dr. Cornelius Baldwin rode up to the clergy house\r\nand delivered to Reverend John Ettwein an order from General John\r\nWarren, general hospital surgeon, which stated that General Washington\r\nhad ordered the General Hospital to Bethlehem and directed the Moravian\r\nbrethren to put their buildings in condition for the reception of the\r\ninvalids and he doubted not “but you will act upon this occasion as\r\nbecomes men and Christians.”\r\n\r\nToward evening Drs. William Shippen and John Warren arrived and made\r\narrangements with Reverend Ettwein for the reception of 250 of the sick.\r\nDuring the ensuing two days the invalids, in charge of their surgeons,\r\ncommenced to arrive. Their suffering from exposure and improper\r\ntransportation made them pitiable objects to behold and two died before\r\nthey were removed from the wagons. Food was scarce and the Moravians\r\nrelieved their distress from their own supplies. Some of the sick were\r\ntaken to Easton and Allentown.\r\n\r\nOn December 7 two deaths occurred and a site for a cemetery was selected\r\non the bluff on the west bank of the Monocacy Creek.\r\n\r\nThe Moravians constantly attended the sick and Mr. Ettwein visited the\r\npatients daily. In February smallpox was brought to the hospital by some\r\nsoldiers, but an epidemic was averted. On March 27, 1777, the hospital\r\nwas transferred to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nDuring the time the hospital was in Bethlehem more than 100 died,\r\ncoffins for whom were made by the Moravian carpenters, who also dug the\r\ngraves and served at the burial of the deceased patriots.\r\n\r\nAgain when the Continental army failed to defend Philadelphia, the\r\nhospital was removed to Bethlehem. On September 13, 1777, Washington\r\nordered all military stores of the army, in 700 wagons to Bethlehem. The\r\nChurch bells of Philadelphia, with the Liberty Bell, were also\r\ntransported to Bethlehem en route to Allentown. Again the Moravians were\r\ndirected to prepare their buildings for hospital use and September 20,\r\nthe sick and wounded began to arrive, among them Lafayette and Colonel,\r\nlater General John Armstrong, of Carlisle. On the twenty-second the\r\narchives and money of Congress, under an escort, arrived.\r\n\r\nOn October 7 the wounded from the Battle of Germantown began to arrive\r\nand in a fortnight 450 patients were being treated. A rain lasting six\r\ndays set in and the suffering was indescribable. The Moravians furnished\r\nmany blankets and much clothing for the destitute soldiers. During\r\nDecember many sick soldiers were brought to Bethlehem from hospitals in\r\nNew Jersey. The loss was enormous due to lack of proper facilities with\r\nwhich to treat the patients, and the mortality during eight months and\r\nten days was 120.\r\n\r\nAmong the surgeons from Pennsylvania were William Shippen, Jr., John\r\nMorgan, Thomas Bond, Jr., William Smith, Bodo Otto, Aquila Wilmot, James\r\nHouston, S. Halling and Francis Allison, Jr.\r\n\r\nOn August 28, 1778, the remaining sixty-five patients were removed to\r\nLancaster and Yellow Springs, and Bethlehem ceased to be a hospital base\r\nduring the war.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Flight of Tory Leaders from Pittsburgh,\r\n                             March 28, 1778\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Edward Hand, the commandant at Fort Pitt, had failed in two\r\nexpeditions, and the resultant effect was disastrous to the American\r\ncause on the border, especially in the spring of 1778. During the\r\nprevious winter the British, under General Howe, had occupied\r\nPhiladelphia, the capital of the colonies; the Continental Congress had\r\nbeen driven to York, and Washington’s Army, reduced to half-naked and\r\nhalf-starved condition, had suffered in camp at Valley Forge, so there\r\nwas not much to win adherents to the cause of liberty among those\r\notherwise inclined.\r\n\r\nGovernor Hamilton, the British commander at Detroit, sent many agents,\r\nred and white, to penetrate the border settlements to organize the\r\nTories into effective military units. In February and March, 1778, a\r\ndaring and shrewd British spy visited Pittsburgh and carried on his\r\nplotting against the colonies almost under the nose of General Hand.\r\nMost of the Tories of this neighborhood were at the house of Alexander\r\nMcKee, at what is now called McKees Rocks. Another place of assembly was\r\nat Redstone, where a British flag flew nearly all of that winter.\r\n\r\nCaptain Alexander McKee, the Tory leader at Pittsburgh, was an educated\r\nman of wide influence on the frontier. He had been an Indian trader and\r\nfor twelve years prior to the Revolution had been the King’s deputy\r\nagent for Indian affairs at Fort Pitt. For a short time he had been one\r\nof the justices of the peace for Westmoreland County, and he was\r\nintimately acquainted with most of the Indian chiefs. In 1764 he\r\nreceived a grant of 1,400 acres of land from Colonel Henry Bouquet, at\r\nthe mouth of Chartier’s Creek, and he divided his time between his house\r\nin Pittsburgh and his farm at McKees Rocks.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1776, McKee was discovered to be in correspondence with\r\nthe British officers in Canada, and he was put on his parole not to give\r\naid or comfort to the enemies of American liberty, and not to leave the\r\nvicinity of Pittsburgh without the consent of the Revolutionary\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1778, General Hand had reason to suspect that McKee had\r\nresumed his relations and correspondence with the British authorities\r\nand ordered the captain to go to York and report himself to the\r\nContinental Congress. For a time McKee avoided compliance, on plea of\r\nillness, but unable to further delay, he contrived to escape to Detroit\r\nand there openly ally himself with the British cause.\r\n\r\nAbout a year before this a young trader, Matthew Elliott, who understood\r\nthe Shawnee language, had been employed by the Americans to carry\r\nmessages from Fort Pitt to the Shawnee and other Indian tribes to the\r\nwestward, in the interest of peace. On one of his missions he was\r\ncaptured by hostile savages and carried to Detroit, where, after a short\r\nimprisonment, he had been released on parole.\r\n\r\nHe returned to Pittsburgh via Quebec, New York and Philadelphia, all\r\nthen in British possession. He had been impressed by the show of British\r\npower in the East, in contrast to the miserable conditions of the\r\nAmerican forces, especially along the frontier. He became convinced that\r\nthe colonists would fail in the Revolution, and on his return to\r\nPittsburgh got into communication with Captain McKee and others of the\r\nTory party.\r\n\r\nElliott was suspected of having poured into McKee’s ears the wild tale\r\nthat he was to be waylaid and killed on his journey to York. McKee heard\r\nsuch a story and believed it, which decided him to escape from Fort Pitt\r\nand go to Detroit.\r\n\r\nThe flight of the Tories took place from Alexander McKee’s house during\r\nthe night of March 28, 1778. General Hand received a hint of this move\r\nearly in the evening and dispatched a squad of soldiers to McKee’s house\r\nSunday morning to remove McKee to Fort Pitt. The soldiers arrived too\r\nlate. The members of the little party who had fled into Indian land in\r\nthat rough season were Captain McKee, his cousin, Robert Surphlit; Simon\r\nGirty, Matthew Elliott, a man of the name of Higgins, and two Negro\r\nslaves belonging to McKee.\r\n\r\nSimon Girty was a Pennsylvanian, who had been captured by the Indians\r\nwhen eleven years old, kept in captivity for three years by the Seneca,\r\nand afterward employed at Fort Pitt as an interpreter and messenger. He\r\nhad served the American cause faithfully. He then became the most\r\nnotorious renegade and Tory in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe Tories in their flight made their way through the woods to the\r\nDelaware town Coshocton, where they tarried several days endeavoring to\r\nincite the tribe to rise against the colonists. Their efforts were\r\nthwarted by Chief White Eyes, who declared his friendship for the\r\n“buckskins” as he called the Americans, and he proved his sincerity\r\nuntil his death.\r\n\r\nChief White Eyes and Captain Pipe, an influential chief, debated in the\r\nCoshocton council on the advocacy of war, White Eyes pleading the cause\r\nof peace. The oratory of White Eyes carried the day and the seven Tories\r\ndeparted to the Shawnee towns on the Scioto, where they were welcomed.\r\nMany of the Shawnee were already on the warpath, and all were eager to\r\nhear the arguments of their friend McKee. James Girty, a brother of\r\nSimon, was then with the Shawnee tribe, having been sent from Fort Pitt\r\nby General Hand on a futile peace mission. He had been raised among the\r\nShawnee, was a natural savage and at once joined his brother and the\r\nother Tories.\r\n\r\nWhen Governor Hamilton heard of the flight of Captain McKee and his\r\ncompanions from Fort Pitt, he dispatched Edward Hazle to the Scioto to\r\nconduct the renegades safely through the several Indian tribes to\r\nDetroit. Hamilton, as would be expected, received them cordially and\r\ngave them commissions in the British service. For sixteen years McKee,\r\nElliott and the Girtys were the merciless scourges of the border. They\r\nwere the instigators and leaders of many Indian raids, and their\r\nintimate knowledge of the frontier rendered their operations especially\r\neffective. Long after the close of the Revolution they continued their\r\ndeadly enmity to the American cause and were largely responsible for the\r\ngeneral Indian war of 1790–94.\r\n\r\nMcKee and his associate renegades left behind them at Fort Pitt a band\r\nof Tories who had planned to blow up the fortress and escape in boats at\r\nnight. In some way the scheme was frustrated just in time, probably by\r\nthe confession of one of the conspirators, and the disaster averted. A\r\nscore of the traitors escaped in boats during the night, and fled down\r\nthe Ohio River. On the following day they were pursued and overtaken\r\nnear the mouth of the Muskingum. Eight of the runaways escaped to the\r\nshore and were lost in the trackless woods; some were killed in the\r\nconflict which then occurred and the others were taken back as prisoners\r\nto Fort Pitt.\r\n\r\nTwo were shot, another hanged and two were publicly whipped on the\r\nparade ground of the fort. The punishment of these men was almost the\r\nlast act performed by General Hand before he was relieved by General\r\nLachlan McIntosh, but it put an end to the machinations of the Tories at\r\nPittsburgh.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Colonel Clapham Commissioned to Build\r\n\r\nFort Augusta, March 29, 1756\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the moment Captain John Smith beheld the waters of the Susquehanna\r\nto the present, it has been the main artery for the development of\r\nCentral and Northern Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe two great branches of the Susquehanna River join at what is now\r\nNorthumberland, but opposite is a plain, where the old Indian town of\r\nShamokin was located, upon which the present city of Sunbury was laid\r\nout July 4, 1772.\r\n\r\nIt was at Shamokin where the Indians established a vice-regal government\r\nand installed the noble Shikellamy, the friend of the English and foe of\r\nintemperance and vice. This was the largest and most important Indian\r\ntown south of Tioga Point. It was visited by the Moravian missionaries\r\nand the interpreter, Conrad Weiser, tarried there in 1737 on his way to\r\na council at Onondaga. He and Shikellamy became intimate friends and\r\nremained so until the latter’s death, December 17, 1748.\r\n\r\nThe erection of a fort at Shamokin was repeatedly urged by friendly\r\nIndians, especially Andrew Montour and Monakatuatha or the Delaware Half\r\nKing, at a council at Harris’ Ferry, November 1, 1755. This request was\r\nfavorably considered by Governor Morris, but refused by the Assembly.\r\n\r\nAfter Braddock’s defeat, when the French and Indians began to attack the\r\nsettlers along the frontier, occurred the terrible massacre at Penn’s\r\nCreek, October 16. Later forty-six terrified settlers fled to Shamokin\r\nfor protection, but the attitude of the Indians caused them to leave the\r\nfollowing day, and as they traveled south they were fired upon from\r\nambush near Mahonoy Creek and four killed.\r\n\r\nThe Moravians broke up their mission at Shamokin and soon thereafter the\r\nIndians abandoned the town.\r\n\r\nOctober 31, 1755, a number of inhabitants gathered at John Harris’ and\r\nsigned a petition for a fort at Shamokin as a protection against the\r\nFrench and Indians. On the same day a like gathering at Conrad Weiser’s\r\nsent a similar petition to the provincial authorities. John Shikellamy,\r\nson of the great vicegerent, went to Philadelphia and personally\r\nsolicited the Governor to build a fort, saying “that such Indians as\r\ncontinue true to you want a place to come to and live in security\r\nagainst your and their enemies, and to Shamokin, when you erect the\r\nfort, they will come and bring their wives and children. Brethren,\r\nhasten the work; our warriors will assist you in building the fort.”\r\n\r\nAt a conference held at Carlisle January 17, 1756, this necessity was\r\nagain brought to the notice of the Governor, who replied that he would\r\nbuild a strong house at Shamokin.\r\n\r\nThe fear of delay was because the French had for some time realized the\r\nimportance of the strategic situation of Shamokin and if they could gain\r\na foothold there the places below would be easy prey.\r\n\r\nThe Governor was determined that the fort should be built and made his\r\nplans accordingly. He informed the Board of Commissioners April 15,\r\n1756, that he had on March 29 commissioned Lieutenant Colonel William\r\nClapham to recruit a battalion for the purpose. This was the third\r\nbattalion and was known as the Augusta Regiment. Major James Burd was\r\nsecond in command and Asher Clayton was commissioned adjutant of the\r\nbattalion.\r\n\r\nThe regiment rendezvoused at Harris’ Ferry, where Governor Morris\r\nattended the recruiting and training in person. On June 12 orders were\r\nreceived to march.\r\n\r\nA stockade was built at Halifax, where supplies were stored and a\r\ngarrison maintained. While at this camp Colonel Clapham had a conference\r\nwith the Iroquois chief, Oghagradisha, assuring him they were on their\r\nway to Shamokin.\r\n\r\nSufficient bateaux were built by July 1, when the regiment marched from\r\nHalifax, and by a tedious march the 400 troops reached Shamokin without\r\nmishap July 6 and immediately began the construction of the fort, which\r\nwas built from plans drawn by E. Meyer, engineer of the British\r\nGovernment. It was called Fort Augusta in honor of the daughter of King\r\nGeorge II.\r\n\r\nColonel Clapham pushed the work of construction with dispatch and\r\nSeptember 23, wrote to Governor Denny, “The fort is now almost finished,\r\nand a fine one it is.” The construction required less than seven weeks\r\nupon the main works, but much time was employed in better protecting the\r\nfortress and in adding necessary buildings.\r\n\r\nMuch difficulty was experienced in obtaining adequate supplies of\r\nprovisions and ammunition, as the only means of transportation were pack\r\nhorses over a mountainous Indian trail or by bateaux and the latter was\r\nimpossible during the severe winters.\r\n\r\nColonel Clapham was succeeded by Colonel James Burd, who left such a\r\nfascinating journal of his experiences at that frontier fort.\r\n\r\nExpeditions were sent out from the fort to the Great Island, now Lock\r\nHaven; to Chinklacamoose, now Clearfield; to Penn’s Creek, to Wyoming,\r\nand other places.\r\n\r\nThe fort faced the main river and was nearly 300 feet square, with\r\nbastions at the four corners. The total length of the fortification was\r\nmore than 600 feet. A magazine was later built in the south bastion and\r\na covered way to the river. This was strongly built with a brick arched\r\nroof and was reached by a narrow stairway descending into it. This is\r\nnow the surviving structure of that dark and gloomy period in the\r\nState’s history. It is the property of the Commonwealth and it is well\r\nmarked and well kept.\r\n\r\nFort Augusta was far in advance of any English settlement in the\r\nProvince, holding the only passage by water and blocking the pathway\r\nalong the river by land, to the settlements below.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly wanted to dismantle the fort and save the expense of the\r\ngarrison, but no Governor would agree to this plan, as it was an actual\r\nprotection for the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nDuring the Revolution Fort Augusta again became an important place, the\r\nheadquarters of the Military Department of the Susquehanna. Colonel\r\nSamuel Hunter, the county lieutenant, mustered and trained troops there\r\nfor the Continental Army. It was here where Colonel Thomas Hartley drew\r\nhis supplies for his expedition against the Indians in 1778.\r\n\r\nIt was at Fort Augusta where the terrified inhabitants found safety in\r\nthe “Great Runaway,” following the Indian incursions which culminated in\r\nthe Wyoming massacre, July 3, 1778.\r\n\r\nThe work of dismantling the fort began about 1780, as the ground then\r\npassed into private hands. Thus this old fort has crumbled into ruins,\r\nits story unsung, its heroes forgotten.\r\n\r\nBut for the wisdom of the Indians this fort would not have been built\r\nand the horrors of the French and Indian War would have been carried to\r\nthe banks of the Delaware. This fort was where the high tide of the\r\nRevolution was turned backward and the English and their Indian allies\r\nforced to turn their faces again toward Canada. It was the largest and\r\nmost important provincial fortification on the frontier of this\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Swedes Come to the Delaware—Peter Minuit\r\n                      Steps Ashore, March 30, 1638\r\n\r\n\r\nSamuel Blummaert, of Holland, who had business interests in Sweden,\r\ndirected the attention of the Swedish Chancellor, Axel Oxenstierna, to\r\nthe possibilities of the copper trade with the West Indies. At that time\r\nPeter Minuit, who had been Governor of New Netherlands, 1626 to 1632,\r\nand was dissatisfied with his treatment, having been dismissed, offered\r\nhis service to Blummaert, knowing that the latter owned lands on the\r\nSouth River, now the Delaware.\r\n\r\nThe great Gustavus died in November, 1632, and upon Oxenstierna devolved\r\nall the burdens of the American scheme. Sweden was poor; the times were\r\nunpropitious; he was forced to wait five years until practical plans\r\ncould be matured. Minuit had suggested the founding of a colony upon the\r\nSouth River to trade with the Indians. A company was formed with the\r\nexclusive right to trade on that river for twenty years and to send\r\ngoods to Sweden for a period of ten years free of duty. The ownership of\r\nthis company was half Swedish and half Dutch.\r\n\r\nAn expedition reached the South River, landing at the mouth of Mispillon\r\nCreek, which they called “Paradise Point.” Passing on upward they cast\r\nanchor at Minquas-kill, where Minuit went ashore March 30, 1638, to\r\nconfer with the Indians. He knew well the story of Swanendael and meant\r\nto avoid a recurrence. The chief with whom he talked was Mattahoorn, the\r\nprincipal sachem of that region and an Indian of worthy character, who\r\ncame often into the early history of Pennsylvania before William Penn\r\narrived. Minuit concluded an agreement, obtaining land on which to build\r\na house for “a kettle and other articles,” and for ground on which to\r\nplant, he was to give half the tobacco raised upon it. The land was\r\ndefined as “within six trees.”\r\n\r\nMinuit had instructions to set up the arms of Sweden and take possession\r\nof the country, avoiding New Netherlands, to do no harm to the Indians,\r\nto name the country New Sweden, to dispose of his cargo and then,\r\nleaving the sloop, return to Sweden.\r\n\r\nMinuit built Fort Christiana, named in honor of the girl queen at\r\nStockholm, five miles below the Dutch Fort Nassau, and left in it when\r\nhe departed twenty-four men.\r\n\r\nNearly coincident with the arrival of the Swedes at Minquas-kill, came a\r\nnew Director-General of the Dutch at Manhattan, in the person of William\r\nKieft, who sailed into that port, March 18, 1638. He was disturbed over\r\nthis Swedish intrusion, and promptly wrote to his company in Holland\r\nand, May 6 addressed a formal letter to Minuit, protesting against his\r\nsettlement, declaring that both banks of the river belonged to the\r\nDutch.\r\n\r\nThis claim by the Dutch to the west bank was based on De Vries’\r\nadventure at Swanendael. Minuit made no reply, he knew that no white man\r\nhad more than six years been living on the west side of the river. So he\r\npushed the work on his fort and built log-houses. Trade with the Indians\r\nwas firmly established. A second treaty with the Indians was made, which\r\npurchase included land down the river and bay and northward as far as\r\nthe Falls of Trenton. Minuit returned with his two vessels, July, 1638.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-four persons now comprising the colony at Christiana were\r\nunder command of Mans Kling, with Hendrik Huyghen as commissary. This\r\ncompany formed the first permanent settlement by white men on the\r\nDelaware Bay, or River, on either side.\r\n\r\nMinuit was lost at sea on his return voyage and New Sweden suffered a\r\nhard stroke of misfortune. He and De Vries were the ablest men ever sent\r\nto the South River.\r\n\r\nThe colony was in such distress in 1639 that the people thought\r\nseriously of abandoning the locality and going to Manhattan, but the\r\nfollowing year another vessel arrived from Sweden with supplies. She\r\nsailed into Christiana, April 17, 1640. On board were four mares and two\r\nhorses, a number of farming implements, thirty-one barrels of beer, and\r\ncolonists, made up to some extent of deserters from the army and people\r\naccused of offenses. This vessel soon returned laden with beaver skins\r\nand other peltry. At this time the Dutch members of the company sold\r\ntheir interest to the Swedes.\r\n\r\nPeter Hollender, who succeeded Peter Minuit as Governor of the Swedes,\r\narrived in April, 1640, and continued in authority until February, 1643.\r\n\r\nAnother effort to send colonists to New Sweden originated in Utrecht. A\r\ncharter granted to Hendrik Hooghkamer and others authorized them to\r\nstart a settlement on the west side of South River twenty miles above\r\nFort Christiana. They were to have what land was needed, provided they\r\nimproved it within ten years. They could start manufactories and carry\r\non trade. They were given religious liberty and were required to support\r\nministers of the Gospel and schoolmasters. But they were compelled to\r\nsubmit to the Swedish law and Government and pay a tax of three florins\r\na year for each family.\r\n\r\nUnder this arrangement the ship Fredenburg sailed from Holland, and\r\narrived at Christiana, November 2, 1640. This ship was armed with\r\ntwenty-five cannon and carried fifty Dutch colonists, headed by Jost de\r\nBogharat. The Fredenburg took back to Sweden 737 beaver skins, 29 bear\r\nskins and some other productions of the New World.\r\n\r\nIt was a difficult matter to find colonists. At this time there were\r\nmany Finns scattered over Sweden, who lived a somewhat nomadic life.\r\nThey roamed about, burned the forests, and shot deer and other game\r\nunlawfully. Severe laws were passed to prevent this wantonness, but the\r\nFinns paid little attention to them, and they refused to return to\r\nFinland. New Sweden seemed to be the solution and the Government of\r\nSweden ordered the capture of these law-breaking Finns.\r\n\r\nAmong those engaged in the pursuit of these Finns was Johan Printz, who\r\nwas later Governor of New Sweden. When he caught a Finn, who had cut\r\ndown six apple trees in the King’s orchard, he was given his choice\r\nbetween going to New Sweden or being hanged.\r\n\r\nTwo vessels were fitted out for the voyage to the New World; one of them\r\ncarried thirty-five colonists, mostly Finns. They set sail in November,\r\n1641, and arrived in New Sweden the following April. Among these\r\narrivals were Olaf Paullsson, Anders Hansson, Axel Stille, Henrich\r\nMattson, Olaf Stille, Mans Swensson, and Per Kock, and their names are\r\nstill borne by families in Pennsylvania. Tobacco soon became the main\r\narticle of commerce sent from New Sweden.\r\n\r\nWhen the Swedes first arrived with Peter Minuit they built inside the\r\nfort little cottages of round logs, with low doors and no windows except\r\nthe loop-holes cut between the logs. The cracks were closed with mud or\r\nclay. The fireplaces were made of stone, and a bake-oven was built\r\nwithin the house.\r\n\r\nIn 1640 lands were bought from the Indians on the west side of the South\r\nRiver from the Schuylkill as far north as the site of Trenton.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                History of Pennsylvania Railroad Begins\r\n                      with Organization of Company\r\n                             March 31, 1847\r\n\r\n\r\nPrior to 1809, Oliver Evans, of Philadelphia, urged repeatedly in public\r\naddresses the construction of a passenger railroad from Philadelphia to\r\nNew York, and in that year attempted to form a company for this purpose.\r\n\r\nIn 1829 a railroad, sixteen miles long, from Honesdale to Carbondale, to\r\ncarry coal, was completed.\r\n\r\nIn 1827 the Mauch Chunk railroad, nine miles long, was built to connect\r\ncoal mines with the Lehigh River; the gauge was three feet seven inches,\r\nand wooden rails were faced with iron.\r\n\r\nThe Baltimore and Ohio finished, in 1829, the first six miles of track\r\nupon which passengers were carried.\r\n\r\nThe Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company was incorporated by\r\nspecial act of the Legislature of Pennsylvania, approved April 4, 1833.\r\n\r\nThe charter granted to the company, December 5, 1833, authorized it to\r\nconstruct a railroad from Reading to Philadelphia. At Reading it was\r\nproposed to connect with the Little Schuylkill Navigation and Railroad,\r\nwhich had been incorporated in 1827, to build a railroad from Tamaqua to\r\nReading.\r\n\r\nThen followed the development of the rails in this country, and the\r\nfirst T-rails made in America were rolled at the Montour Mill, in\r\nDanville, Pa., in 1845. This was also an American invention. The first\r\nrails, thirty feet in length, were made at the Cambria Iron Works, at\r\nJohnstown, Pa., in 1856.\r\n\r\nThe greatest development of the locomotive was made by the great Baldwin\r\nplant in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nAmong the several great railroad groups of America is that of the\r\nPennsylvania system, and this corporation enjoys the distinction of\r\nhaving the greatest number of individual stock holders.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania Railroad Company, the most important carrier in\r\nPennsylvania and in the Eastern United States, and one of the greatest\r\nand most extensive railroad systems in the entire world, was brought\r\ninto existence by an act of Assembly of Pennsylvania, approved by\r\nGovernor Francis R. Shunk, April 13, 1846. Letters patent were issued\r\nFebruary 15, 1847, and the company organized March 20, but the election\r\nof officers was held and the actual beginning of this great corporation\r\ndates from March 31, 1847.\r\n\r\nUnder the articles of incorporation this company was authorized to\r\nconstruct, equip, and operate a line of steam railroad to connect with\r\nthe then known Harrisburg, Portsmouth, Mount Joy and Lancaster Railroad,\r\nand to run to Pittsburgh or to any point in Allegheny County, or to\r\nErie, in Erie County, as its management might deem expedient.\r\n\r\nThis charter was not obtained without opposition, as it was understood\r\nthat the operation of this new railroad would draw from the revenues\r\nupon which the State system of public works largely depended for\r\nsupport. This was undoubtedly true, but the charter was granted and the\r\nwork of construction was carried forward with such vigor that in 1850\r\nportions of the line were completed and ready for operation.\r\n\r\nThe Erie Canal, devised by DeWitt Clinton, and constructed by David\r\nThomas, a Pennsylvanian, had deflected the trade of the Great Lakes and\r\nthe West from Philadelphia to New York, and made the latter the leading\r\ncity of the nation. It was expected that a railroad over the mountains\r\nwould bring this trade back to Philadelphia and restore the supremacy of\r\nthat city.\r\n\r\nIn order to make sure that no outside influence should get control, the\r\ncharter provided that all of the directors “shall be citizens and\r\nresidents of this Commonwealth.” This part of the plan failed, but the\r\nleading capitalists of Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and elsewhere in the\r\nState, subscribed liberally to the stock of the company and from the\r\nbeginning the enterprise was well backed with ample funds and equally\r\nvaluable influence.\r\n\r\nHardly had the original road been opened for traffic before the company\r\nbegan to extend its lines and enlarge the field of its operations.\r\n\r\nThe movement which proved of the greatest benefit to the public, and to\r\nthe company itself, was in 1857, when the Legislature passed an act, May\r\n16, directing the line of public works between Philadelphia and\r\nPittsburgh to be sold, and the Pennsylvania Railroad Company became the\r\npurchaser.\r\n\r\nThe purchase price was seven and one-half millions, and ownership was\r\nobtained for the combined State canal and railroad. The State was\r\nrelieved of a burdensome property, and at the same time these public\r\nworks were placed under the control of a corporation whose methods of\r\nmanagement must result in great benefit to the people of the State.\r\n\r\nGovernor James Pollock caused the sale to be made, June 25, and on July\r\n31 following the actual transfer was consummated.\r\n\r\nThis transaction fixes the date from which the progressive history of\r\nthe Pennsylvania Railroad Company begins.\r\n\r\nThe canals on the Susquehanna and its branches above the mouth of the\r\nJuniata, together with the Delaware division, were sold the following\r\nyear to the Sunbury and Erie Railroad Company, now a part of the great\r\nPennsylvania system, and the work of extension did not cease.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania Railroad Company, in 1861, leased for 999 years the\r\nHarrisburg, Portsmouth, Mount Joy and Lancaster road and brought it\r\nunder the Pennsylvania’s management.\r\n\r\nThe work of extension has ever kept pace with the opportunity to develop\r\nthis great railroad system until it includes, in whole, or in part, more\r\nthan one hundred lesser lines of road, with its main line, branches and\r\nspurs.\r\n\r\nThe great terminal station in Philadelphia, recently damaged by fire,\r\nwill soon be replaced by one of the finest railroad stations in the\r\nworld, even comparable with the great Pennsylvania Station in New York\r\nCity.\r\n\r\nThe greatest corporation in Pennsylvania is the railroad system which so\r\ngloriously carries the name of the Keystone State into every part of the\r\nWestern Hemisphere.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Great Indian Council Opened at Harris’ Ferry, April 1, 1757\r\n\r\n\r\nSeptember 10, 1756, Governor Denny ordered a suspension of hostilities\r\nagainst the Indians on the east side of the Susquehanna. A month later\r\nMajor Parsons wrote from Easton that nine Indian men and one Indian\r\nwoman with four white prisoners had arrived at Easton. One of the\r\nprisoners was Henry Hess, who had been taken prisoner on New Year’s day\r\nfrom his father’s plantation in Lower Smithfield, Northampton (now\r\nMonroe) County. These had been sent by Tedyuskung from Wyoming.\r\n\r\nThe Governor sent Conrad Weiser to Easton, who met and greeted the\r\nIndians in his behalf. Weiser concluded his mission by inviting\r\nTedyuskung to meet the Governor in Philadelphia, but he declined and\r\ndemanded the Governor convene a council at Easton.\r\n\r\nThis attitude incensed the Governor, who refused to humor the Indians,\r\nand said no treaty should be held outside of Philadelphia. The Governor\r\nfinally yielded and under escort of a heavy guard proceeded to Easton.\r\nThis treaty was formally opened on Monday, November 8, with a great\r\ndisplay of militia and ceremonial pomp. Tedyuskung was again the\r\nprincipal speaker for the Indians and he assured the Governor that the\r\nDelaware were glad to meet again their old friends, the English. The\r\ncouncil continued nine days, during which Governor Denny appears to have\r\nconducted himself with much tact and good judgment.\r\n\r\nEarly in December accounts were received that some of the Indians who\r\nhad been at the Easton treaty had, on their way home, murdered certain\r\nwhite settlers on the frontiers—thus making it appear that Tedyuskung’s\r\nauthority over these Indians was very doubtful.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of January George Croghan, next to Sir William Johnson\r\nthe most prominent figure among British Indian agents, sent Joe Peepy,\r\nson of the deceased Shikellamy, and Lewis Montour, son of the celebrated\r\nMadame Montour, with a message to the Susquehanna Indians, inviting them\r\nto attend a council, or treaty, at Lancaster. Peepy and Montour\r\ndelivered the message to the Indians assembled in council at Tioga when\r\nthey went to the Ohio to inform the Delaware and Shawnee there of the\r\nproposed Lancaster meeting.\r\n\r\nUpon their return Peepy and Montour reported to Croghan that all the\r\nSusquehanna Indians were disposed for peace except the Munsee, or\r\nMinisink Indians, although the messengers believe that these Indians\r\nwould come down to the treaty with King Tedyuskung.\r\n\r\nOn February 18, 1757, Zaccheus, a Delaware Indian, formerly of\r\nGnadenhuetten, arrived at Fort Allen and on the following day seven\r\nIndian women and three children arrived there, all sent from Tioga by\r\nTedyuskung to announce to Governor Denny that they intended to come in\r\nMarch to Easton to hold a treaty.\r\n\r\nEarly in March Tedyuskung with two of his sons, his half-brothers,\r\nCaptain Harris and Sam Evans, squaws and children, in all numbering\r\nabout fifty, arrived at Fort Allen. Captain Arndt, commandant of the\r\nfort, advised Major Parsons that these Indians had “built cabins about\r\nsixty perches from the fort, where they live and intend to stay till the\r\nKing comes.”\r\n\r\nAbout the time these Indians had departed from Wyoming for Fort Allen\r\nall the Six Nations, Nanticoke and Delaware, who had accompanied\r\nTedyuskung there from the Council at Tioga, proceeded down the river to\r\nFort Augusta at Shamokin.\r\n\r\nMajor James Burd, then in command of the garrison, wrote, March 21,\r\nadvising Governor Denny that 150 Six Nations had arrived there. “Sent by\r\nSir William Johnson to oblige the Delawares to lay down the hatchet, and\r\nto be present at the treaty proposed between the Government and the\r\nDelawares.” These Indians did not tarry long at Fort Augusta, for they\r\narrived at John Harris’ March 29, where they were met by George Croghan,\r\nwho reported there were “about 160 of them—men, women and children—part\r\nof eight tribes.” A day later they were joined by some Conestoga\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nApril 1 a formal conference between Croghan and the Indians was begun at\r\nHarris’ Ferry. Thus this much-discussed council was opened at neither\r\nLancaster, where Croghan had suggested it be held, nor at Easton, where\r\nTedyuskung said it would be held, but at John Harris’ Ferry, now\r\nHarrisburg.\r\n\r\nAmong the white men present were the Reverend John Elder, of the Paxton\r\nPresbyterian Church, known as the “Fighting Parson,” Captain Thomas\r\nMcKee, John Harris and Hugh Crawford. Scarouady was the principal\r\nspeaker for the Indians.\r\n\r\nOn April 6 it was decided to remove the council-fire to Lancaster, and\r\nthe next day the entire company marched thither, being met on the\r\noutskirts of Lancaster by a number of the principal inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe conference at Lancaster was delayed by the failure of Governor Denny\r\nto attend. Smallpox had broken out among the Indians, and they were\r\nuneasy. At length the Governor reached Lancaster, attended by members of\r\nthe Provincial Council, the Assembly, the Indian Commissioners, Colonel\r\nStanwix of the “Royal Americans,” and a number of citizens.\r\n\r\nThree days later, May 12, 1757, the conference was formally opened in\r\nthe Lancaster Courthouse. “Little Abe” and Thomas King were the chief\r\nspeakers for the Indians. The former told of the declaration of the\r\nDelaware at a council where they denied the allegation they were women,\r\nand further said they acknowledged no authority over them among the Six\r\nNations, but would listen to the Seneca.\r\n\r\nLittle Abe then advised that the Seneca be invited to a meeting with the\r\nDelaware and Shawnee at Lancaster or elsewhere. Messengers were\r\naccordingly sent, who were also instructed to see Tedyuskung and inquire\r\nas to the reasons for his absence from the Lancaster conference, which\r\nwas that day brought to a close.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d all the Indians, in charge of Captain McKee, departed from\r\nLancaster and arrived at Fort Augusta June 1. They tarried four days,\r\nand on the 5th all, except the Delaware, left the fort “in canoes, with\r\nplenty of flour, rum, etc., sufficient to carry them home.” The Delaware\r\nstarted a few days later across the country to Bethlehem.\r\n\r\nEdward Shippen, of Lancaster, in a letter to his son-in-law, Major James\r\nBurd, at Fort Augusta, dated May 22, 1757, among other interesting\r\nthings wrote: “We have had many meetings of the Indians here, to whom\r\nvaluable presents have been given by the Governor and the Quakers; but\r\nas Tedyuskung and the Indians who were expected along with him were not\r\ncome, a very handsome part is reserved for them.\r\n\r\n“It appears to me that unless the Militia Act be passed we of this\r\nborough shall in less than a month become the frontiers.”\r\n\r\nOn June 16, 1757, Sir William Johnson held a conference with the\r\nOnondaga, Cayuga and Seneca, of the Six Nations, and made an earnest and\r\nsuccessful appeal for them to remain loyal to the English. Tedyuskung\r\nwas severely censured for his conduct, and Sir William charged the\r\nSeneca to bring him around to a sensible understanding.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             First Mint Established in Philadelphia by Act\r\n\r\nof April 2, 1792\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project of a national mint for the United States was first\r\nintroduced by Robert Morris, of Philadelphia, the patriot and financier\r\nof the Revolution.\r\n\r\nAs the head of the Finance Department, Mr. Morris was instructed by\r\nCongress to prepare a report on the foreign coins then in circulation in\r\nthe United States. On January 15, 1782, he laid before Congress an\r\nexposition of the whole subject, and accompanying this report, was a\r\nplan for American coinage.\r\n\r\nRobert Morris was assisted in his effort to establish a mint by Thomas\r\nJefferson and Alexander Hamilton.\r\n\r\nOn April 15, 1790, Congress instructed the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nAlexander Hamilton, to prepare and report a proper plan for the\r\nestablishment of a national mint. This was done at the ensuing session\r\nof Congress. The act was framed and passed finally March 26, 1792, and\r\nreceived the approval of President George Washington April 2, 1792.\r\n\r\nA lot of ground was purchased on Seventh Street near Arch, and\r\nappropriations were made for erecting the necessary buildings. An old\r\nstillhouse, which stood on the lot, had first to be removed. In an\r\naccount book of that time we find an entry on July 31, 1792, of the sale\r\nof some old material from the stillhouse for seven shillings and\r\nsixpence, which Mr. Rittenhouse directed “should be laid out for punch\r\nin laying the foundation stone.”\r\n\r\nDavid Rittenhouse was the first Director of the Mint, April 14, 1792,\r\nuntil his health compelled him to resign in June, 1795.\r\n\r\nThis building for the United States Mint in Philadelphia was the first\r\nstructure erected in America for public use under authority of the\r\nFederal Government. It was a brick building, the cornerstone of which\r\nwas laid by David Rittenhouse July 31, 1792.\r\n\r\nIn the following October operations were commenced by the coinage of the\r\nsilver half dimes. President Washington mentions this first coinage in\r\nhis address to Congress, November 6, 1792, as follows: “There has been a\r\nsmall beginning in the coinage of half dimes, the want of small coins in\r\ncirculation calling the first attention to them.”\r\n\r\nThe original purchase of metal for coinage was six pounds of old copper\r\nat one shilling and three pence per pound, which was coined and\r\ndelivered to the Treasurer in 1793. The first deposit of silver bullion\r\nwas made July 18, 1794, by the Bank of Maryland. This consisted of coins\r\nof France amounting to $80,715.73½. The first return of silver coins to\r\nthe Treasurer was made on October 15, 1794. The first deposit of gold\r\nbullion was made by Moses Brown, a Boston merchant, on February 12,\r\n1795, and paid for in silver coins. The first gold coins turned into the\r\nTreasury were 744 half eagles, on July 31, 1795. Eagles were first\r\ndelivered September 22, when 400 were delivered.\r\n\r\nThere were four different currencies or rates, in different parts of the\r\nUnion, and a consequent perplexity, until the passage of the law which\r\nregulated the coins of the United States. The present system of coins is\r\nformed upon the principles laid down in the resolution of 1786, by which\r\nCongress determined the denominations should be dollars (the dollar\r\nbeing the unit), dimes or tenths, cents or hundredths, and mills or\r\nthousandths of a dollar.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more simple or convenient than this decimal\r\nsub-division. The terms are proper because they express the proportions\r\nwhich they are intended to designate. The dollar was wisely chosen, as\r\nit corresponded with the Spanish coin, with which the colonists had long\r\nbeen familiar.\r\n\r\nThe mills were imaginary and never coined. The first cents were made of\r\ncopper, round and about an inch in diameter and one-sixth of an inch in\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting fact that silver was first coined in money 869\r\nyears before the Christian era.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the coinage of silver dollars at the Philadelphia mint, in\r\n1794, there occurred an amusing incident in Congress, when a member from\r\nthe South bitterly opposed the choice of the eagle, on the ground of its\r\nbeing the “king of birds,” and hence neither proper nor suitable to\r\nrepresent a nation whose institutions were inimical to monarchial forms\r\nof government.\r\n\r\nJudge Thatcher playfully in reply suggested that perhaps a goose might\r\nsuit the gentleman, as it was a rather humble and republican bird, and\r\nwould also be serviceable in other respects, as the goslings would\r\nanswer to place on the dimes.\r\n\r\nThis answer created considerable merriment, and the irate Southerner,\r\nconceiving the humorous rejoinder as an insult, sent a challenge to the\r\nJudge who promptly declined it. The bearer, rather astonished, asked,\r\n“Will you be branded as a coward?” “Certainly, if he pleases,” replied\r\nThatcher; “I always was one and he knew it, or he would never have\r\nrisked a challenge.”\r\n\r\nThe affair occasioned much mirth, and, in due time, former existing\r\ncordial relations were restored; the irritable Southerner concluding\r\nthere was nothing to gain fighting one who fired nothing but jokes.\r\n\r\nMarch 2, 1829, provisions were made by Congress, for extending the Mint\r\nestablishment, the supply of bullion for coinage having increased beyond\r\nthe capacity of the existing accommodations.\r\n\r\nThe Mint edifice under this provision was erected at the northwest\r\ncorner of Chestnut and Juniper Streets. The corner-stone was laid July\r\n4, 1829, by Samuel Moore, then Director of the Mint. The building was\r\noccupied in 1833.\r\n\r\nThis was among the finest of Philadelphia’s classic structures, and it\r\nwas admired by every resident and visitor. The building was of marble\r\nand of the Grecian style of architecture, the roof being covered with\r\ncopper. Each front on Chestnut Street and Penn Square was ornamented\r\nwith a portico of sixty feet, containing six Ionic columns.\r\n\r\nThe present structure on Spring Garden Street is huge and an impressive\r\nbuilding, but a disappointment when compared with the beautiful edifice\r\nthat it supplanted. It was first occupied October 1, 1901, and was about\r\nthree years in building.\r\n\r\nNearly two-thirds of our coinage comes from the mint at Philadelphia,\r\nwhich is the largest and most completely equipped mint in the world. The\r\ncoins for nearly all the South American countries are also made in this\r\nmint.\r\n\r\nA wonderful collection of coins and medals of all lands can be seen by\r\nthe public in this building.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Act for Purchase of Erie Triangle Passed\r\n\r\nApril 3, 1792\r\n\r\n\r\nFor many years after William Penn received the charter for Pennsylvania\r\nhe was engaged in controversies over the boundary line of his Province,\r\nand long after his death the several proprietaries were concerned with\r\nthe question. It was not until 1774 that the controversy with Maryland\r\nwas concluded, and it was after the Revolution that the armed conflict\r\nwith Connecticut was finally determined by Congress, and the imminent\r\nconflict with Virginia over the territory west of the Alleghenies was\r\nsatisfactorily settled.\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1786, after many difficulties between the States of\r\nPennsylvania and Virginia, that the western boundary of our State was\r\nsurveyed by extending the Mason and Dixon line to the end of the five\r\ndegrees west from the Delaware River and a meridian drawn from the\r\nwestern extremity to the northern limit.\r\n\r\nIn 1785 commissioners were appointed on the part of Pennsylvania and New\r\nYork to ascertain the northern boundary of the former from the Delaware\r\nRiver westward to the northwest corner. The commissioners were David\r\nRittenhouse on the part of Pennsylvania, and Samuel Holland on the part\r\nof New York. They proceeded to act in pursuance of that appointment, and\r\nin December, 1786, ascertained and fixed the beginning of the\r\nforty-third degree of north latitude, erected suitable monuments there\r\nand near the Delaware River, but were prevented by inclement weather\r\nfrom proceeding further in the survey.\r\n\r\nThe next year Andrew Ellicott was appointed a commissioner, on the part\r\nof Pennsylvania, and James Clinton and Simeon Dewitt on the part of New\r\nYork. In 1787 they completed the running and marking of this northern\r\nboundary 259 miles and 88 perches from its commencement at the Delaware\r\nRiver, to its termination in Lake Erie, five or six miles east of the\r\nOhio State line and marked the whole distance throughout by milestones,\r\neach one indicating the distance from the Delaware River. In 1789 an act\r\nof Assembly confirmed the acts of the commissioners.\r\n\r\nThe Indians being recognized as owners of the soil, the whole was\r\npurchased from them by different treaties. One at Fort Stanwix\r\nextinguished their title to the lands of Western Pennsylvania and New\r\nYork, excepting the Triangle or Presqu’ Isle lands, which were\r\naccidentally left out of Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts,\r\nConnecticut and Virginia and were supposed at different times to belong\r\nto each.\r\n\r\nGeneral William Irvine discovered while surveying the Donation Lands\r\nthat Pennsylvania had but a few miles of lake coast and not any harbor,\r\nand in consequence of his representations the State of Pennsylvania made\r\npropositions for its purchase from Philips and Gorham, the reputed\r\nowners, in the year 1788. Surveyor General Andrew Ellicott surveyed and\r\nestablished lines at the request of the Federal Government, but Frederic\r\nSaxton accompanied him on behalf of the owners.\r\n\r\nIt was finally determined by comparison with the charters of New York,\r\nMassachusetts and Connecticut just what was the western limit of New\r\nYork. This was found to be twenty miles east of Presqu’ Isle.\r\n\r\nOn June 6, 1788, the Board of Treasury was induced to make a contract\r\nfor the sale of this tract described as bounded “on the east by New\r\nYork, on the south by Pennsylvania and on the north and west by Lake\r\nErie.”\r\n\r\nOn September 4 it was resolved by Congress “that the United States do\r\nrelinquish and transfer to Pennsylvania all their right, title and claim\r\nto the Government and jurisdiction of the said land forever, and it is\r\ndeclared and made known that the laws and public acts of Pennsylvania\r\nshall extend over every part of said tract as if the said tract had\r\noriginally been within the charter bounds of the State.”\r\n\r\nBy an act of October 2, 1788, the sum of £1200 was appropriated to\r\npurchase the Indian title to the tract, in fulfillment of the contract\r\nto sell it to Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nAt the treaty of Fort McIntosh, January 9, 1789, Chief Cornplanter and\r\nother chiefs of the Six Nations signed a deed in consideration of the\r\nsum of £1200, ceding the Presqu’ Isle lands to the United States. It was\r\nthen, by a deed dated March 3, 1792, ceded by the United States to\r\nPennsylvania. This deed is signed by George Washington, President, and\r\nThomas Jefferson, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nIn 1790 Surveyor-General Andrew Ellicott made a survey of the triangle\r\nand found it to contain 202,287 acres. The purchase-money paid to the\r\nUnited States, at seventy-five cents an acre, was $151,640.25.\r\n\r\nThis purchase having been completed before the passage of the act of\r\nApril 3, 1792, the lands within it except the reservations were sold\r\nunder the provisions of this act. The first settlements in Erie County\r\nwere made under the provisions of that law, and many instances of\r\npersonal violence occurred between the contending claimants. The\r\nsquatters would league together to prevent the legal claimants from\r\ndepriving them of their improvements.\r\n\r\nThe settlement of the lands northwest of the Allegheny River, and\r\nespecially the Presqu’ Isle lands, was never cordially acquiesced in by\r\nthe Six Nations, and Cornplanter became very unpopular among his own\r\npeople. It was charged upon him that he and Little Billy had received\r\nthe purchase price both at Fort McIntosh and Philadelphia. Cornplanter\r\nhimself protested to the United States at Buffalo Creek in June, 1794,\r\nagainst the garrison established by General Anthony Wayne at Presqu’\r\nIsle, when he went out against the Miami Indians.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Reading Railroad Incorporated by Act\r\n                          Passed April 4, 1833\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Philadelphia and Reading Railway Company was incorporated by special\r\nact of the Legislature of Pennsylvania, approved April 4, 1833.\r\n\r\nThe charter granted to the company, December 5, 1833, authorized it to\r\nconstruct a railroad from Reading to Philadelphia. At Reading it was\r\nproposed to connect with the Little Schuylkill Navigation and Railroad,\r\nwhich had been incorporated in 1827, to build a railroad from Tamaqua to\r\nReading. By a latter statute the company was authorized to extend its\r\nroad from Reading to Port Clinton, where connection was made with the\r\nLittle Schuylkill and Navigation and Railroad.\r\n\r\nThe Philadelphia and Reading Railroad was planned primarily to transport\r\nanthracite from the Schuylkill region to Philadelphia and intermediate\r\npoints, especially where a number of blast furnaces were then operating.\r\n\r\nAnthracite was known to exist in the Schuylkill Valley as early as 1800,\r\nsince which time the iron industry had become one of much importance,\r\nthe first furnace being established on Manatawney Creek, near Pottstown,\r\nin 1716. Wood and charcoal were first used in smelting the ore, but the\r\nincreasing scarcity of these fuels led to experiments, which, in 1808,\r\nproved that anthracite could be used advantageously as furnace fuel.\r\n\r\nAnthracite was first transported by the Schuylkill Canal from the\r\nvicinity of Pottsville to Philadelphia, and the furnaces in the\r\nSchuylkill Valley. The growing need for this new fuel in domestic and\r\nfurnace use and the limitations of canal transportation led to the era\r\nof railroad construction between the anthracite regions and tidewater\r\nports.\r\n\r\nOn December 5, 1839, the railroad was opened to traffic from Reading to\r\nPhiladelphia, and on January 1, 1842, the first locomotive and train\r\npassed over the entire line between Mount Carbon in Schuylkill County,\r\nand Philadelphia. On May 17, 1842, the Richmond Branch, from the Falls\r\nof the Schuylkill to the terminal at Port Richmond, on the Delaware, was\r\nopened, from which time the Reading has been an important railroad.\r\n\r\nIn 1853 the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company began the\r\nconstruction of the Lebanon Valley Railroad, extending from Reading to\r\nHarrisburg. The line was completed in 1858, and merged into the Reading\r\nRailroad.\r\n\r\nMay 8, 1871, the parent company bought the Northern Liberties and Penn\r\nTownship Railroad, in Philadelphia, control of which had been obtained\r\nin 1857.\r\n\r\nIn the period between 1859 and 1870, the Philadelphia and Reading\r\nRailroad Company commenced the systematic extension which has resulted\r\nin the development of the present Reading System. In that period the\r\ncompany acquired through purchase or lease twenty-six railroads. Between\r\n1870 and 1880, thirteen more were acquired; in the next decade nine were\r\nadded; from 1890 to 1900 eight were acquired and since 1900, four more\r\nwere added, until, at the present time the Reading Company, with its\r\naffiliated lines operates 1619.15 miles of railroad, exclusive of the\r\nCentral Railroad of New Jersey, and 3.63 miles of road leased jointly by\r\nthe Reading Company and the Central Railroad of New Jersey.\r\n\r\nForming quite a contrast with the huge high-speed Pacific type\r\nlocomotives used today, are the locomotives used in the early days. At\r\nfirst these locomotives in appearance were somewhat grotesque. Their\r\nloud puffing was alarming, and the twenty-mile speed was terrifying.\r\n\r\nOne of these early engines, the Rocket, has been preserved for posterity\r\nand is on exhibition in the Columbia Avenue Station in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThe Rocket never ran when it rained. On clear days it was capable of\r\ntaking a train at nearly thirty miles per hour. It burned wood as fuel\r\nbut later adopted coal.\r\n\r\nThe engineer of the Rocket was also the fireman. When his steam was\r\nrunning low he reached over, grabbed a log from the pile along the\r\nplatform, thrust it into the fire box, then again became an engineer.\r\nThere was only one lever, and that was the throttle. All the way ahead\r\nthere was one speed, same in reverse. There were only four wheels and no\r\ndriving rods. There were no brakes on the Rocket. It had a kerosene\r\nbull’s eye and a pop whistle, and at night when it came crashing along\r\nat its twenty-mile clip, its bull’s-eye quivering, its stack emitting\r\nsparks, its whistle popping, it was the marvel of the countryside.\r\n\r\nOf almost equal interest are the stories of the first day coaches and\r\nthe Pullman cars. In the early days the coaches were very narrow, built\r\nto meet the conditions of the narrow-gauge tracks, as there was a row of\r\ndouble seats in one side of the aisle and a row of single seats on the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThere were first and second class coaches, designated by the figure 1\r\nand 2 on the sides of the car. Those of the first class were upholstered\r\nwith black hair cloth, while the second-class had only plain wooden\r\nseats and backs. The windows were small and placed near the roof.\r\n\r\nIn the winter the cars were heated with wood stoves. The cars were\r\nlighted with candles. When a change from one line to another was made\r\neach passenger picked out his own baggage and attended to its loading on\r\nthe new train.\r\n\r\nAt the dining stations the menu consisted of coffee and ham sandwiches\r\nand sometimes beef stew.\r\n\r\nThe first sleeping cars were the ordinary day coaches changed by adding\r\nsleeping requirements. They were usually divided into four compartments,\r\nin each of which three bunks were built against one side of the car,\r\nwhile in a corner of the rear end of the car were provided water, a\r\ntowel and a basin. No bedclothes were furnished, and the passengers,\r\nfully dressed, retired upon rough mattresses with their overcoats pulled\r\nover them for covering.\r\n\r\nContinued patronage by the public of the day coaches, parlor, sleeping\r\nand dining cars led, step by step to the facilities for comfortable and\r\nluxurious travel offered today, where there is nothing left to be\r\ndesired and modern American railroad comfort is supreme.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Mary Jemison, White Woman of Genesee,\r\n                         Captured April 5, 1758\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thrilling narrative of the life of Mary Jemison, who was captured by\r\nthe Indians April 5, 1758, when only twelve years old, and who continued\r\nto live among them during her long and eventful life, marrying two\r\nchiefs of renown, continues to this day to be a wondrous story of one of\r\nthe most remarkable captivities suffered at the hands of the Indians by\r\nthe pioneer settlers of this country.\r\n\r\nMary Jemison, who came to be known as “The White Woman of the Genesee,”\r\nrelated her own story of her capture and life among the Indians when\r\neighty years old.\r\n\r\nShe endured hardship and suffering with astonishing fortitude, and\r\namidst all the surrounding of barbaric life she preserved the\r\nsensibilities of a white woman. The story of the captivity may be\r\nbriefly told as follows: Thomas and Jane Erwin Jemison emigrated from\r\nIreland about the year 1746. Mary, the fourth child, was born on\r\nshipboard during the voyage to America.\r\n\r\nThomas Jemison removed his family to the then frontier settlements of\r\nPennsylvania on a tract of excellent land lying on Marsh Creek, in\r\nFranklin Township, Adams County. They removed to another place near the\r\nconfluence of Sharps Run and Conewago Creek, a short distance from their\r\nfirst home.\r\n\r\nA few neighbors had come to live with the Jemison family on account of\r\nthe men being with Washington’s army and their fear of the Indians.\r\n\r\nOne morning Mary returned from an errand to the mill, and a man took her\r\nhorse to his house after a bag of grain. Mary’s father was busy with the\r\nchores, her mother was getting breakfast; the two older brothers were in\r\nthe barn, and the little ones with Mary and the neighbor woman and her\r\nthree children in the house.\r\n\r\nBreakfast was not yet ready when they were alarmed by the discharge of a\r\nnumber of guns. On opening the door the man and horse lay dead. The\r\nIndians captured Mr. Jemison, then rushed into the house and made\r\nprisoners of Mrs. Jemison, Robert, Matthew, Betsey and Mary and the\r\nother woman and her three children and then plundered the house. The two\r\nbrothers in the barn escaped and afterward went to Virginia.\r\n\r\nIn the attacking party were six Indians and four Frenchmen, and after\r\nthey took everything they wanted and all the food in the house, they set\r\nout in great haste with their prisoners, keeping them in single file,\r\nusing a whip when any one lagged behind. No food or water was given them\r\nall that day, and at night, fatigued and hungry, they were compelled to\r\nlie upon the ground without fire or shelter. In the morning they were\r\ngiven breakfast from the provisions taken from the Jemison home.\r\n\r\nThey were made to march a great distance the second day and at night had\r\na meal with bread and meat.\r\n\r\nAn Indian removed Mary’s shoes and stockings and put a pair of moccasins\r\non her feet which Mrs. Jemison believed meant they intended to spare her\r\nlife and destroy the other captives. An Indian removed the shoes and\r\nstockings from the neighbor boy, and after putting moccasins on him, led\r\nhim and Mary off from the others some distance into the woods and there\r\nlaid down with them for the night.\r\n\r\nThat was the last time Mary ever saw her parents, for during the night,\r\nthe Indians murdered in most cruel manner the rest of the captives and\r\nleft their bodies in the swamps to be devoured by wild beasts.\r\n\r\nDuring the next day’s march Mary had to watch them scrape and dry the\r\nscalps of her parents, brothers and sisters and neighbors. Her mother’s\r\nhair being red, she could easily distinguish it from the others, but she\r\nknew them all, and the sight was one which remained with her during all\r\nher life.\r\n\r\nThe boy was given to the French and Mary was given to two Shawnee\r\nsquaws. They started down the Ohio in canoes, toward their home at\r\nSciota. Upon arrival at the home of the squaws, Mary was given a suit of\r\nIndian clothing and formally adopted according to Indian custom,\r\nreplacing a brother of the squaws, who had been killed in war. She was\r\ngiven the Indian name Dickewamis, which means pretty girl or good thing.\r\nShe was not allowed to speak English, so soon learned the Indian tongue.\r\n\r\nAt this time the English had taken Fort Pitt, and as soon as the corn\r\nwas harvested the Indians went to the fort to make peace with the\r\nBritish and Mary was taken along. She went with a light heart, feeling\r\nsure she was to be restored to her brothers. The English asked her many\r\nquestions about herself, and this interest so alarmed her Indian sisters\r\nthat they hurried her away in their canoe. She learned later that some\r\nwhite people had come to take her away, but could not find her.\r\n\r\nHer Indian sisters made her marry a Delaware Indian named Sheninjee.\r\nMary spoke of him as noble, large in stature, elegant in appearance,\r\ngenerous in conduct, courageous in war, a friend to peace and a great\r\nlover of justice. Truly a fine tribute for an Indian warrior.\r\n\r\nHer first child died soon after birth, but the fourth year she had a son\r\nwho she named in memory of her father, Thomas Jemison.\r\n\r\nShe had many hardships traveling with her child to the Genesee country,\r\nwhich was 600 miles through an almost pathless wilderness.\r\n\r\nHer husband died while she was en route to her new home. Several times\r\nefforts were made to restore her to the English, and on one occasion the\r\nchiefs determined she should be given up, but she fought against it\r\nherself and her Indian brother helped her in her effort to remain among\r\nthe Indians.\r\n\r\nSeveral years after the death of her husband she married Hiokatoo,\r\ncommonly called Gardow, by whom she had four daughters and two sons. Her\r\nsecond husband was the most cruel Indian known.\r\n\r\nMary Jemison continued to live in the German Flats, N. Y., and upon the\r\ndeath of Hiokatoo became possessed of much valuable land.\r\n\r\nTwo great sorrows were experienced when a feud between her sons resulted\r\nin John, a wayward fellow, killing Thomas, who was a great comfort to\r\nhis mother and a leader among the Indians, and some years later John\r\nkilled his other brother, Jesse.\r\n\r\nThis double grief was almost more than the venerable woman could endure\r\nand it was not assuaged when John was murdered in a drunken quarrel with\r\ntwo Indians.\r\n\r\nShe was naturalized April 19, 1817, by which she received a clear title\r\nto her reservation. In 1823 she disposed of the major portion of her\r\nreal estate holdings, reserving a tract two miles long and one mile\r\nwide.\r\n\r\nShe died September 19, 1833, aged ninety-one years, and was buried with\r\nChristian service in the cemetery of Seneca Mission Church, Buffalo\r\nCreek Reservation. Her body was reinterred on March 7, 1874, in the\r\nIndian Council House Grounds at Letchworth Park, where an elegant bronze\r\nstatue marks the grave of Mary Jemison, “The White Woman of the\r\nGenesee.”\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Governor Penn Makes Trip Through State,\r\n                         Starting April 6, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing the last great purchase from the Indians at Fort Stanwix,\r\nOctober 23, 1784, the State enjoyed a steady flow of immigration. There\r\nwas an abundance of fertile and cheap lands, a desirable climate and low\r\ntaxes. It was possible for a foreigner to buy and hold lands with\r\nrelinquishment of their allegiance to the country of their birth. This\r\nright had been granted for three years from 1787, and was continued for\r\na longer period after 1790.\r\n\r\nAbout this time John Penn, son of Thomas Penn, and a grandson of William\r\nPenn, and twice governor of the Province, traveled through the State to\r\nlook after some of the Proprietary estates, and during his trip from\r\nPhiladelphia to Carlisle and return he made some notes that are replete\r\nwith interest.\r\n\r\nHe set out from Philadelphia on the morning of April 6, 1788, on horse\r\nback. He passed through the Township of Roxborough, and on his way saw\r\ntwo meeting houses filled with people, another proof that the Friends\r\nwere still faithful to their old traditions.\r\n\r\nAt a tavern where he alighted he met a hoary-headed guest who invited\r\nhim within, calling him the “honorable proprietor.” That night he rested\r\nat Brooke’s tavern and very much admired the sign, which was a striking\r\nlikeness of Dr. Benjamin Franklin, painted by George Rutter (Ritter), a\r\nnoted sign painter of that period. He then called on Frederick A.\r\nMuhlenberg, Speaker of the last Assembly.\r\n\r\nAs Penn drew near Reading he was questioned by a person concerning a\r\nmanor of which he was the owner. This was Penn’s Mount, at that time on\r\nthe eastern limits of the town. Penn thought Reading was finely\r\nsituated. He dined on catfish with Abraham Whitman, the only tavern\r\nkeeper who had not voted against the confirmation of the proprietary\r\nestate. He visited a ferry, still belonging to him, and from there went\r\nto a farm “belonging to the proprietors,” which he determined to divide\r\nand sell in smaller parcels.\r\n\r\nPenn paid a visit to Angelica, the beautiful farm belonging to General\r\nThomas Mifflin, situated a few miles from Reading. A neighbor of General\r\nMifflin’s, who attracted Penn’s attention, was “one of the marrying\r\nDunkers, who live in their own houses like other countrymen, but wear\r\ntheir beards long.”\r\n\r\nPenn tarried here until the 9th, then went to Womelsdorf, passing on the\r\nway one place that was “remarkable for its European appearance.” He then\r\nrode through Lebanon, “a handsome town containing some hundred\r\ninhabitants.” The horses were “baited” at Millerstown.\r\n\r\nAbout sunset Penn caught his first glimpse of the Susquehanna “flowing\r\nbetween its wooded and cultivated banks close to the town” of\r\nHarrisburg.\r\n\r\nPenn adds: “Mr. Harris, the owner and founder of the town, informed me\r\nthat three years ago there was but one house built and seemed to possess\r\npride and pleasure in his success.\r\n\r\n“Though the courts are held here generally, Lebanon is infinitely\r\nlarger. The situation of this place is one of the finest I ever saw. One\r\ngood point of view is the tavern, almost close to the river. It is\r\ncalled the Compass, and is one of the first public houses in\r\nPennsylvania. The room I had is twenty-two feet square and high in\r\nproportion.”\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast on the morning of April 11 Penn and John Harris walked\r\nto the ferry and had a thrilling experience while ferrying across the\r\nriver, and on account of the high water and swift current they were\r\ncarried far out of their course.\r\n\r\nAbout two miles west of the river they passed the home of Robert\r\nWhitehill, the Assemblyman, and about 3 o’clock in the afternoon they\r\nreached the town of Carlisle.\r\n\r\nThe first buildings seen were three or four separate wings, intended for\r\nmagazines originally, but granted by Congress to the trustees of\r\nDickinson College for twenty years. The Reverend Charles Nisbet, D. D.,\r\nwas then at the head of the institution.\r\n\r\nIn the neighborhood of Carlisle Penn had lands in charge of General John\r\nArmstrong. Colonel Robert Magaw was also his companion during his stay\r\nin Carlisle.\r\n\r\nAfter remaining in Carlisle until the 13th Penn commenced his return to\r\nPhiladelphia by rising early in order “to see a cave near Conedoguinet\r\nCreek,” in which the water petrifies as it drops from the roof. Then he\r\nresumed his route and noted the “Yellow Breeches Creek,” reaching the\r\nSusquehanna, again crossed Harris’ Ferry and then traveled along the\r\neastern bank of the river to Middletown. He was impressed with the\r\nscenery and made many comments about both banks of the river. He wrote:\r\n\r\n“At Middletown I put up at one More’s, who was a teacher formerly at\r\nPhiladelphia of Latin and Greek. He talked very sensibly, chiefly on\r\nsubjects which discovered him to be a warm Tory and friend of passive\r\nobedience. Here the Great Swatara joins the Susquehanna, and a very fine\r\nmill is kept at their confluence by Mr. Frey, a Dutchman, to whom I\r\ncarried a letter from Mr. D. Clymer.”\r\n\r\n“April 14. Before my departure Mr. Frey showed me his excellent mill and\r\nstill more extraordinary millstream, running from one part of the\r\nSwatara for above a mile till it rejoins it at the mouth. It was cut by\r\nhimself, with great expense and trouble, and is the only work of the\r\nkind in Pennsylvania. Middletown is in a situation as beautiful as it is\r\nadapted to trade, and already of respectable size.”\r\n\r\nPenn then writes of passing through Elizabethtown, and over Creeks\r\nConewago and Chickesalunga, and adds: “As you leave Dauphin for\r\nLancaster County the lands improve.” He was told of a farm “said to be\r\nworth £15 per acre.”\r\n\r\nOn his return through Lancaster Penn learned that the country was\r\nfriendly to the new Federal Constitution, the argument being “that\r\nmatters could not be worse nor taxes higher.”\r\n\r\n“April 15. I rode alone over to Bluerock and spent a great part of the\r\nday in examining the grounds, not returning till dusk. The consequence\r\nof this ride was the resolution I made of keeping or purchasing nearly\r\n200 acres round a spot admirably calculated for a country seat.”\r\n\r\nPenn’s next stop was at the Horse and Groom, next to Nottingham Meeting\r\nHouse. To this society William Penn had given forty acres as a place of\r\nworship. The titles were in dispute, owing to the boundary lines being\r\nuncertain between Pennsylvania and Maryland, and the grandson, having\r\nhis eyes wide open to all possibilities, remarked that he could gain\r\nlittle information of his “claims to these lands.”\r\n\r\nContinuing his journey Penn reached Wilmington, and after a brief visit\r\nthere returned to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Edwin Forrest, the Great American Actor,\r\n                      Founded the Home for Actors,\r\n                             April 7, 1873\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the asylums which has attracted more attention than many others\r\nis the Edwin Forrest Home for Retired Actors.\r\n\r\nIt was founded under the direction of Edwin Forrest, the famous\r\ntragedian, who by his will, dated April 5, 1866, bequeathed to his\r\nexecutors, James Oakes of Boston, James Lawson of New York, and David\r\nDougherty of Philadelphia, all his property, with the exception of\r\nannuities to his sisters and some personal legacies, in trust for an\r\ninstitution “which they will call the Edwin Forrest Home.” He further\r\ndirected that it should be established at his country place called\r\nSpring Brook, below Holmesburg, in the city of Philadelphia, which he\r\nhad purchased some years before.\r\n\r\nMr. Forrest recommended that an application should be made to the\r\nLegislature for a charter to trustees, with authority to conduct the\r\naffairs of the institution in accordance with his plans.\r\n\r\nApplication was accordingly made, and on April 7, 1873, James Oakes of\r\nBoston, James Lawson of New York, Daniel Dougherty, John W. Forney,\r\nJames H. Castle, John H. Michener, and the mayor of Philadelphia for the\r\ntime being, were made a body politic by the name of the Edwin Forrest\r\nHome, with authority to carry out the designs of the donor.\r\n\r\nThe estate which Mr. Forrest left was largely in real property, land and\r\nhouses, some of it unproductive and waiting for a market, so that there\r\nwas no product from it. In addition there was a claim on behalf of his\r\nwife, who had been separated from him for years, which seemed to affect\r\nhis property. She had been divorced in the State of New York, where the\r\njudge had allowed her alimony, three thousand dollars per year, and this\r\nclaim was thought to be good against Mr. Forrest’s estate during the\r\nentire period of her life.\r\n\r\nThis condition embarrassed the executors, but a compromise was arrived\r\nat which released the property, upon payment of a large sum of money, by\r\nwhich the aggregate fund for the support of the home was considerably\r\ndiminished.\r\n\r\nThe executors were not able to open the home until 1876, when it\r\ncommenced with four inmates, William Lomas, George G. Spear, Mrs. Rhoda\r\nWood and Mrs. Burroughs. To these old actors and actresses was shortly\r\nadded Jacob W. Thoman, who had made his first appearance at the Chestnut\r\nStreet Theater, Philadelphia, in 1834.\r\n\r\nThe location of the home was far out in the country and the actors who\r\nspent their life in the environment of the stage, would prefer to spend\r\ntheir declining days near the theatres, so that they could frequently\r\nvisit them and renew acquaintances and friendships with old companions\r\nof the mask and wig.\r\n\r\nThe mansion was a fine house, and capable of being made comfortable. It\r\nwas of old style, three stories high, skirted by broad pillared\r\nporticos, tastefully decorated with growing plants.\r\n\r\nThe halls and rooms were hung with portraits and works of arts, and\r\nmarble busts of the great characters of earlier days were there in\r\nabundance. Many fine oil portraits of Forrest in different roles were\r\namong the collection of art. Many interesting play-bills of his early\r\nperformances, and portraits of most of the actors who had won fame\r\nbefore the footlights were on the walls.\r\n\r\nThe bedrooms were each furnished with high-post bedsteads, and old types\r\nof bureaus and dressers.\r\n\r\nThe library was unique and wonderfully furnished, and the eight thousand\r\nvolumes embraced the classics, treatises upon art, and interesting\r\nhistories of the stage. In niches of the walls were busts of the\r\nnation’s great men. Art masterpieces in oil and marble were to be found\r\nin the old home.\r\n\r\nThe farm attached to the fine mansion contains one hundred and eleven\r\nacres.\r\n\r\nEdwin Forrest was born in Philadelphia, March 9, 1806. He died there\r\nDecember 12, 1872.\r\n\r\nHis father was Scotch, his mother of German birth. He exhibited from\r\nearly age a taste for the stage, and when eleven years old participated\r\nin theatrical representations as a member of an amateur club, sometimes\r\nperforming female roles.\r\n\r\nHis first appearance on the regular stage was on November 27, 1820, in\r\nthe part of Douglas in Home’s tragedy of that name.\r\n\r\nA protracted professional tour in the west and south ensued, in which he\r\nwon considerable reputation.\r\n\r\nHis first great success was achieved May 26, 1826, in the Park Theater,\r\nNew York, as Othello. This led to a long engagement at the Bowery\r\nTheater, where he enjoyed extraordinary popularity.\r\n\r\nIn 1836 he crossed the Atlantic and first appeared as Spartacus in Drury\r\nLane Theater, London, October 17. He achieved distinguished success, and\r\nacquired the friendship of Macready, Kemble, and others.\r\n\r\nIn 1837 he married Catherine Norton Sinclair, daughter of John Sinclair\r\nthe singer, and soon afterward returned to the United States, where he\r\nwas welcomed by enthusiastic audiences.\r\n\r\nIn 1845 Mr. and Mrs. Forrest returned to London. During this visit,\r\nwhich lasted two years, a rupture occurred in the friendly relations\r\nbetween Forrest and Macready, and to the zeal with which the friends of\r\nthe former espoused his quarrel was due the disgraceful riot in New\r\nYork, May 10, 1849, during an engagement of Macready at the Astor Place\r\nTheater. This was accompanied by serious loss of life.\r\n\r\nSoon after Forrest separated from his wife, and between 1853 and 1860 he\r\nretired from professional life, but when he returned to the stage he\r\nfilled the role of Hamlet with all his former acceptance.\r\n\r\nLatterly he suffered considerably from illness, and his last engagement\r\nbegan on February 6, 1871.\r\n\r\nHe died of apoplexy, surviving the attack only half an hour.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of fine presence, well equipped for his profession,\r\nnaturally frank and engaging.\r\n\r\nA large part of his valuable library and Shakespeare collection, which\r\nhe had spent many years in gathering, was almost entirely destroyed by\r\nfire in his house in Philadelphia, January 15, 1873.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Monument Erected to Colonel Kelly, Revolutionary\r\n\r\nWar Hero, April 8, 1835\r\n\r\n\r\nA monument to the memory of Colonel John Kelly was erected with\r\nimpressive ceremonies April 8, 1835, in the Presbyterian burial-ground,\r\nin the borough of Lewisburg. A company of cavalry from Northumberland\r\nCounty, one from Union, and three infantry companies participated.\r\nGeneral Abbott Green was grand marshal, with General Robert H. Hammond,\r\nGeneral Michael Brobst, Colonel Philip Ruhl and Surgeon Major Dr. James\r\nS. Dougal as aids.\r\n\r\nThe parade was formed by the adjutant, Colonel Jackson McFadden, with\r\nthe citizen militia on the right of line, followed by the veterans of\r\nthe Revolutionary War and those of the War of 1812, and hundreds of\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting feature of the large procession was a float which\r\nwas drawn by four gray horses, upon which was placed the monument.\r\nCavalry on either side acted as a guard of honor. In the carriages were\r\nthe orator, General James Merrill, the clergy, and relatives of the old\r\nhero in whose honor the celebration was being held.\r\n\r\nUpon its arrival at the ground, after the proper military manoeuver was\r\nperformed, the monument was set by the architects, William Hubbard, F.\r\nStoughton, Samuel Hursh and Charles Penny. The orator had a subject\r\nworthy of his best efforts, for such was Colonel John Kelly.\r\n\r\nColonel Kelly was born in Lancaster County, February, 1744. Almost\r\nimmediately after the purchase from the Indians, November 5, 1768, he\r\nwent to Buffalo Valley, in what is now Union County. There he endured\r\nhardships common to all the settlers who pushed out along the frontiers.\r\nHe was in the prime of manhood, of a robust constitution, vigorous and\r\nmuscular, 6 feet 2 inches in height, and almost insensible to fatigue,\r\nand so accustomed to dangers that bodily fear was foreign to his nature.\r\n\r\nColonel Kelly served in the Revolutionary War and distinguished himself\r\nin the battles of Trenton and Princeton. In the course of one of the\r\nretreats Colonel James Potter sent an order to Major Kelly to have a\r\ncertain bridge cut down to prevent the advance of the British, who were\r\nthen in sight. Kelly sent for an ax, but represented that the enterprise\r\nwould be very hazardous. Still the British advance must be stopped and\r\nthe order was not withdrawn. He said he could not order another to do\r\nwhat some would say he was afraid to do himself—he would cut down the\r\nbridge.\r\n\r\nBefore all the logs were cut away he was within range of the British\r\nfire, and many balls struck the logs. The last log fell sooner than he\r\nexpected and he fell with it into the swollen stream. The American\r\nsoldiers moved off, not believing it possible to assist him to make his\r\nescape. He, however, reached the shore and joined the troops and managed\r\nto capture an armed British scout on the way and took him into camp a\r\nprisoner of war.\r\n\r\nHistory records the fact that our army was saved by the destruction of\r\nthat bridge, but the manner in which it was done or the person who did\r\nit is not mentioned.\r\n\r\nAfter his discharge Major Kelly returned to his farm and family, and\r\nduring the three succeeding years the Indians were troublesome to the\r\nsettlers on the West Branch. He became colonel of the regiment, and it\r\nwas his duty to guard the valley against the incursions of the savages.\r\n\r\nWhen the “Big Runaway” occurred following the Wyoming massacre, Colonel\r\nKelly was among the first to return. For at least two harvests reapers\r\ntook their rifles to the field, and some of the company watched while\r\nothers wrought.\r\n\r\nColonel Kelly had the principal command of scouting parties in the\r\nvalley, and very often he went in person. Many nights he laid on the\r\nbranches of trees without a fire, because it would have indicated his\r\nposition to the enemy. He was skilled in Indian mode of warfare and was\r\na terror to their marauding bands.\r\n\r\nSo greatly was he feared by the savages that they determined on his\r\ndestruction and, being too cowardly to attack him openly, sought his\r\nlife by stealth. One night he apprehended they were near. He rose early\r\nnext morning and, looking through the crevices of his log house, he\r\nascertained that two at least, if not more, were lying with their arms\r\nso as to shoot him when he should open his door. He fixed his own rifle\r\nand took his position so that by a string he could open the door and\r\nwatch the Indians. The moment he pulled the door open two balls came\r\ninto the house and the Indians rose to advance. He fired and wounded\r\none, when they both retreated. When safe to do so he followed them by\r\nthe blood, but they escaped.\r\n\r\nAfter the capture and destruction of Fort Freeland, Colonel Kelly with a\r\ncompany of men went to the scene of the battle and buried the dead.\r\n\r\nFor many years Colonel Kelly held the office of Justice of the Peace,\r\nand, in the administration of justice, he exhibited the same anxiety to\r\ndo right, which had characterized him in his military service. He would\r\nat any time forego his own fees, and, if the parties were poor, pay the\r\nconstable’s costs, to procure a compromise.\r\n\r\nWhile he was a devout Presbyterian he entertained an intense hatred for\r\nan Indian. When the Presbytery of Northumberland called on Colonel Kelly\r\nfor a contribution to be used to evangelize the savages, he refused to\r\ngive one cent, but said he would cheerfully subscribe any sum required\r\nto buy ropes to hang them.\r\n\r\nToward the end of a long and active life, Colonel Kelly became by\r\ndisease incapable of much motion; and seldom left his home. He died\r\nFebruary 18, 1832, aged eighty-eight years. He was greatly respected by\r\nhis neighbors and friends, and it is little wonder that a monument was\r\nunveiled to his memory three years later.\r\n\r\nThe spring of 1856 the monument, together with his remains, were removed\r\nto the new and beautiful cemetery on the western border of the Union\r\nCounty seat.\r\n\r\nThe old colonel was survived by his wife, seven sons and two daughters.\r\nOne son, James, was the father of United States Senator James K. Kelly,\r\nof Oregon.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Captain John Armstrong Murdered in Jack’s\r\n                         Narrows April 9, 1744\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Armstrong, a trader among the Indians, residing on the Susquehanna\r\nabove Peter’s Mountain, on the east bank of the river, and two of his\r\nservants, James Smith and Woodward Arnold, were barbarously murdered\r\nApril 9, 1744, by an Indian of the Delaware tribe named Musemeelin in\r\nJack’s Narrows, now Huntingdon County.\r\n\r\nThe murderer was apprehended and delivered up by his own nation and\r\nimprisoned at Lancaster, whence he was removed to Philadelphia lest he\r\nshould escape or his trial and execution, if found guilty, produce an\r\nunfavorable impression on the Indians. This was particularly important,\r\nas a large council was about to convene at Lancaster.\r\n\r\nGovernor George Thomas directed that the property of Armstrong be\r\nreturned to his family. He also invited a deputation of the Delaware\r\ntribe to attend the trial of Musemeelin and to be present at his\r\nexecution, if such was to take place.\r\n\r\nNine of Armstrong’s relatives and neighbors went in search of the\r\nremains of the murdered men and to gather such evidence as they could\r\nabout the details of the crime. They signed a deposition before James\r\nArmstrong, one of His Majesty’s justices of the peace for Lancaster\r\nCounty, dated “Paxtang, 19th day of April, 1744.”\r\n\r\nThese deponents testified that when they learned of the murder they met\r\nat the house of Joseph Chambers, in Paxtang, and determined to go to\r\nShamokin and consult with Shilkellamy, the vicegerent of the Six\r\nNations, what they should do concerning the affair.\r\n\r\nShikellamy sent eight Indians to accompany the deponents. The entire\r\nparty then went to the house of James Berry, on Mahantango Creek, which\r\nempties into the Susquehanna above the mouth of the Juniata.\r\n\r\nOn the way to Berry’s three of the Indians ran away, but on the morning\r\nafter their arrival there, the deponents, with the five Indians, set out\r\nin quest of the bodies.\r\n\r\nThey proceeded to the last known sleeping place of John Armstrong and\r\nhis men, and a short distance from this place James Berry picked up the\r\nshoulder bone of a human being. He showed his find to his companions,\r\nand the action of the Indians at this time proved to the whites that\r\nthey knew more about the crime than they had made known.\r\n\r\nThe party proceeded along a path three miles, heading to the Juniata\r\nNarrows, to a point where they suspected the crime to have been\r\ncommitted. Here the white men directed the Indians to go farther down\r\nthe creek, but they hung back, and actually followed the white men. Some\r\neagles or vultures were noticed and then the Indians disappeared.\r\n\r\nAt this place a corpse was discovered, which they believed to be that of\r\nJames Smith; three shots were heard at a short distance, and the\r\ndeponents, believing the Indians had fired them to advise the finding of\r\nanother corpse, rushed to the place, but the Indians had run away. A\r\nquarter of a mile farther down the creek the corpse of Woodward Arnold\r\nwas found lying on a rock.\r\n\r\nThe deponents examined the bodies of Arnold and Smith and found them to\r\nhave been most barbarously and inhumanely murdered by being gashed with\r\ndeep cuts on their heads with tomahawks, and other parts of their bodies\r\nmutilated. The body of Armstrong was believed to have been eaten by the\r\nsavages.\r\n\r\nThis deposition was signed by Alexander Armstrong, a brother of John,\r\nthe murdered man, who lived at the mouth of Armstrong’s Creek, above the\r\npresent town of Halifax, Dauphin County; Thomas McKee; John Foster, who\r\nalso lived on the west side of the Susquehanna; William Baskins, James\r\nBerry, who lived on the east side, near the Juniata, and John Watts,\r\nJames Armstrong and David Denny.\r\n\r\nThe atrocity of this outrage was so revolting that a Provincial Council\r\nwas held to take the matter into consideration, and it was finally\r\nresolved that Conrad Weiser should be sent to Shamokin to make demands,\r\nin the name of the Governor, for those concerned in the crime.\r\n\r\nMr. Weiser arrived at Shamokin, May, 1744, and delivered Governor\r\nThomas’ message to Allummapees, then the Delaware King, a large number\r\nof that tribe and in the presence of Shikellamy and a small number of\r\nthe Six Nations.\r\n\r\nFollowing the presentation of the affidavit, Allummapees replied,\r\nconfessing the guilt of Musemeelin. Shikellamy then arose and entered\r\ninto a full account of the unhappy affair.\r\n\r\nHe claimed that Musemeelin owed Armstrong some skins, and that Armstrong\r\nseized a horse and rifled gun belonging to the Indian in lieu of the\r\nskins. These were taken by Smith for Armstrong.\r\n\r\nWhen Musemeelin met Armstrong near the Juniata, he paid all the account\r\nbut twenty shillings and demanded his horse. Armstrong refused to give\r\nup the animal, and after a quarrel the Indian went away in great anger.\r\n\r\nSome time later Armstrong and his two servants, on their way to the Ohio\r\ncountry, passed by the cabin of Musemeelin, and his wife demanded the\r\nhorse of Armstrong, but by this time he had sold the beast to James\r\nBerry.\r\n\r\nUpon his return from a hunting trip his wife told Musemeelin of her\r\ndemand to Armstrong. This angered the Indian, who determined on revenge.\r\n\r\nMusemeelin engaged two young Indians to go on a hunting trip, but he led\r\nthem to the camp of Armstrong and his men. When they arrived at a fire\r\nJames Smith was sitting there alone. Musemeelin told Smith he wanted to\r\nspeak with him privately, and they went into the woods. Musemeelin soon\r\ncame back laughing, as he had killed Smith and shot Arnold, whom he\r\nfound coming back to the camp.\r\n\r\nThe young Indians were terrified, but too afraid of Musemeelin to leave\r\nhim. They soon came across John Armstrong sitting on an old log.\r\nMusemeelin asked: “Where is my horse?” Armstrong replied: “He will come\r\nby and by.” “I want him now,” said Musemeelin. “You shall have him. Come\r\nto the fire and let us smoke and talk together,” said Armstrong. As they\r\nproceeded, Armstrong in the advance, Musemeelin shot him in the back,\r\nthen tomahawked him.\r\n\r\nShikellamy further said that the three Indians buried John Armstrong and\r\nthat the others were thrown into the river.\r\n\r\nJacks Narrows, where this crime was committed, takes it name from\r\nCaptain John (Jack) Armstrong, the victim.\r\n\r\nMusemeelin was not convicted of the crime, but returned to his wigwam\r\nand was looked upon by his savage people as a hero.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Tories of Sinking Valley Take Oath to King\r\n                             April 10,1778\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the tragedies during the Revolutionary war, none seem more\r\nmelancholy than those connected with efforts of the disaffected to\r\nescape to the enemy. During the winter of 1777–78, British agents were\r\nbusy along the western frontier and as far east as Cumberland County,\r\nseeking to corrupt the frontier settlers, insinuating sentiments of\r\ndiscontent, assuring them that the American cause was sure to fail and\r\nmaking glittering promises of reward for those who should join the cause\r\nof the King.\r\n\r\nOne of the agents visited the valleys of the Allegheny Mountains in what\r\nis now Blair County, but then was a part of Bedford. He was successful\r\nin deluding a considerable band of ignorant frontiersmen by the most\r\ndespicable methods.\r\n\r\nThis rascal held out to these mountaineers a vision of wholesale plunder\r\nand carnage on the property of their patriot neighbors. His appeals were\r\nmade only to the vicious, who were promised if they would organize and\r\njoin a force of British and Indians coming down the Allegheny Valley in\r\nthe spring they would be permitted to participate in a general onslaught\r\non the settlements and would receive their share of the pillage and, in\r\naddition to this, they should each receive grants for the lands of the\r\nrebel neighbors to the extent of 300 acres each, wherever they should\r\nselect.\r\n\r\nOne of the men who entered into this despicable plot afterward confessed\r\nthat it was the design to slaughter the peaceable inhabitants without\r\nmercy—men, women and children—and seize their property and lands.\r\n\r\nIn the northern part of Blair County is a deep valley called Sinking\r\nSpring Valley. It is still a wild and romantic country, but 150 years\r\nago was singularly desolate and lonely and seemed a fitting place for\r\nthe meeting of such conspirators as had been enlisted in this cruel Tory\r\nplot.\r\n\r\nIn Sinking Spring Valley the tory band held its gatherings during\r\nFebruary and March, 1778. Many of the plotters were from the frontier\r\nsettlement of Frankstown, near what is now Hollidaysburg. The leader was\r\nJohn Weston, a bold, lawless man, half farmer, half hunter, half\r\ncivilized, who lived with his wife and brother, Richard, in a crude\r\nmountain cabin.\r\n\r\nThe British agent, having thoroughly enlisted Weston in the murderous\r\nenterprise, returned up the Allegheny, promising to be at Kittanning\r\nabout the middle of April, with 300 Indians and white men, there to meet\r\nhis mountain friends and with them swoop down on the other settlements,\r\nand make all of his partisans weary under the burden of their rich\r\nplunder.\r\n\r\nWeston furthered the propaganda and enlisted thirty of his neighbors in\r\nthe adventure. Alarming intelligence of the Tory plans leaked out,\r\nreached the larger settlement of Standing Stone, now Huntingdon, where\r\nit was reported that a thousand Indians and Tories were about to fall on\r\nthe frontier.\r\n\r\nA stockade had been built at Standing Stone, but its garrison never\r\nconsisted of more than a score of green militiamen, and there was a\r\ngeneral flight of the terrified people from the upper valley of the\r\nJuniata toward Carlisle and York.\r\n\r\nThe band of plotters was joined, about April 1, by a man named McKee, of\r\nCarlisle. He had been in communication with a British officer, who was\r\nconfined in Carlisle, with other prisoners of war. He gave McKee a\r\nletter addressed to all British officers, vouching for the loyalty of\r\nMcKee and his associates. This letter was to be used in securing\r\nprotection and a welcome for the Sinking Spring Valley Tories when they\r\nshould meet with the British and Indians on their flight to the\r\nAllegheny.\r\n\r\nAt the appointed time word reached the valley that a large force of\r\nIndians had gathered at Kittanning. The last meeting of the plotters was\r\nheld April 10, in the forest, and thirty-one took the oath of allegiance\r\nand pledged themselves to follow Weston.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, at the break of day they began their march\r\nover the mountains. In the afternoon of the second day they had come\r\nwithin a few miles of their intended destination, when they encountered\r\na band of about 100 Iroquois Indians. The savages burst suddenly out of\r\nthe thicket in full war paint.\r\n\r\nJohn Weston sprang forward, waving his hand and crying out, “Friends!\r\nFriends!” The Indians were not in the British conspiracy, but were bent\r\non a plundering raid on their own account and regarded Weston and his\r\narmed companions as a hostile party.\r\n\r\nThe Indian chieftain fired at Weston, and the Tory leader fell dead. His\r\nstartled and horrified followers halted in dread astonishment. Another\r\nof the savages sprang forward and, before the ignorant borderers could\r\nrecover from their surprise, tore the scalp from Weston’s head.\r\n\r\nAt this point McKee rushed out, holding aloft in one hand a white\r\nhandkerchief and in the other hand the letter from the British officer\r\nat Carlisle, and called out to the Indians: “Brothers! Brothers!” The\r\nsavages did not respond. Almost as suddenly as they appeared they\r\nvanished into the undergrowth, leaving the bewildered mountaineers alone\r\nwith their dead and scalped leader. Weston was buried where he fell.\r\n\r\nThe Tories feared to go forward and even more to return to their homes.\r\nThey held a consultation, when some declared their intention to return\r\nto Bedford County, but others feared arrest and determined they would\r\nseek safety elsewhere.\r\n\r\nHard was the fate of this company. Some of them wandered in the forests\r\nand perished from hunger. Some of them made their way to the southward,\r\nand reached British posts after great suffering. Five of them returned\r\nto their homes in Sinking Spring Valley and were seized by the aroused\r\nfrontiersmen and lodged in the log jail at Bedford.\r\n\r\nRichard Weston, brother of the slain leader, was caught near his home by\r\na party of settlers going to work in the lead mines there, and he was\r\nsent under guard to Carlisle. Weston confessed the whole plot, but\r\nclaimed he had been misled by his older brother. He escaped from prison\r\nbefore his trial, so his taint of treason was hardly to be blamed on his\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Executive Council ordered a special court to try the\r\nprisoners at Bedford. It held two sessions in the fall of 1778 and\r\nspring of 1779, with General John Armstrong, of Carlisle, as president.\r\nThe court failed to convict any of the defendants on the charge of high\r\ntreason. The leaders were either dead or out of the country, and the few\r\nmen brought before the court seemed to be sufficiently punished by their\r\nimprisonment and the contempt of their neighbors.\r\n\r\nThose who fled away were tainted with treason and their estates were\r\ndeclared forfeited.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Captain John Brady, Noted Hero, Killed by\r\n                         Indians April 11, 1779\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain John Brady was foremost in all the expeditions that went out\r\nfrom the West Branch of the Susquehanna settlements, and his untimely\r\ndeath, April 11, 1779, was the worst blow ever inflicted upon the\r\ndistressed settlers.\r\n\r\nJohn Brady, second son of Hugh and Hannah Brady was born in 1733, near\r\nNewark, Delaware. He came with his parents to Pennsylvania, married Mary\r\nQuigley, when he was twenty-two years old, and soon thereafter enlisted\r\nin the French and Indian War. On July 19, 1763, he was commissioned\r\ncaptain and assigned to the Second Battalion of the Pennsylvania\r\nRegiment, commanded by Governor John Penn and Lieutenant Colonels\r\nTurbutt Francis and Asher Clayton.\r\n\r\nThe following year his command was with Colonel Henry Bouquet on his\r\nexpedition west of the Ohio, and was actively engaged against the\r\nIndians who made terrible slaughter in Bedford and Cumberland Counties.\r\n\r\nCaptain Brady was one of the officers who received land grants from the\r\nProprietaries, and, in 1768, he removed his family to Standing Stone,\r\nnow Huntingdon. The following year he changed his residence to a site\r\nopposite the present town of Lewisburg. He was a land surveyor and his\r\nnote books furnish much valuable land data.\r\n\r\nIn 1776 Brady removed to Muncy Manor, where he built a semi-fortified\r\nlog house, known later as Fort Brady. It was in what is now the borough\r\nof Muncy, and was a private affair but was classed among the provincial\r\nfortifications.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1775, when Colonel William Plunket made his famous\r\nexpedition to the Wyoming Valley, Captain John Brady was one of his\r\nablest assistants. When the Twelfth Regiment of the Continental Line was\r\norganized under command of Colonel William Cooke, September 28, 1776,\r\nCaptain Brady was one of the original captains. Two of Captain Brady’s\r\nsons married daughters of Colonel Cooke.\r\n\r\nAt the Battle of Brandywine the Twelfth was engaged under General John\r\nSullivan and was cut to pieces in the desperate fighting near the\r\nBirmingham Meeting House. Captain John Brady was among those seriously\r\nwounded, and his son, John, a lad of only fifteen, who had come like\r\nDavid of old, with supplies for the camp and had remained for the\r\nbattle, was also wounded, and only saved from capture by the act of his\r\ncolonel in throwing the boy upon a horse when the troops retreated. So\r\nfierce was the fighting that every officer in Captain Brady’s company\r\nwas killed or wounded, together with most of his men.\r\n\r\nCaptain Brady was given a leave of absence while the army was in winter\r\nquarters at Valley Forge, and during this time was at his home at Fort\r\nBrady. When the Indians became so troublesome between the North and West\r\nBranch Valleys, he removed his family to Sunbury, and September 1, 1778\r\nreturned to the army. He served for a time with Colonel Daniel\r\nBrodhead’s regiment at Fort Pitt.\r\n\r\nJames Brady, Captain John’s second son, who was himself a militia\r\ncaptain, was mortally wounded August 8, 1778, while he was working in\r\nthe field near Fort Muncy. Young Brady survived his frightful wound for\r\nfive days and died at Sunbury in the arms of his mother, an heroic\r\npioneer woman.\r\n\r\nCaptain John Brady had taken such an active part in the efforts of the\r\nsettlers to subdue the Indian atrocities, and his daring and repeated\r\nendeavors had so intensified their hatred, that they determined his\r\ncapture above all other efforts.\r\n\r\nApril 11, 1779, Captain Brady went up the river some distance to procure\r\nsupplies for those in the fort, and he took with him a wagon, team and\r\nguard, and was in charge of the party. They secured the supplies and\r\nwere returning in the afternoon, Captain Brady astride a fine mare.\r\nWithin a short distance of the fort, where the road forked, he was\r\nriding a little distance in the rear of the team and guard, and engaged\r\nin conversation with Peter Smith, who was walking. He determined that\r\nthey would not follow the team, but would take another and shorter road\r\nto the fort. They rode and walked along together until they reached a\r\nsmall run where the same roads again joined. Brady observed, “This would\r\nbe a good place for Indians to secrete themselves.” Smith replied “yes.”\r\nThat instant three rifles cracked and Brady fell.\r\n\r\nThe mare ran toward Smith, who grabbed her and threw himself upon her\r\nback and in a few moments reached the fort.\r\n\r\nThe people in the fort heard the rifle shots and, seeing Smith on the\r\nmare coming at full speed, all rushed out to learn the fate of Captain\r\nBrady. Mrs. Brady led those of the party in reaching Smith’s side. Smith\r\ntold them, “Brady is in heaven or hell or on his way to Tioga,” meaning\r\nthat he was either killed or taken prisoner. Those in the fort ran to\r\nthe spot and soon found the captain lying on the ground, his scalp and\r\nrifle gone; but the Indians had been in too much haste to take his watch\r\nor shot-pouch.\r\n\r\nSamuel, known as “Old Sam,” Brady happened to be at the fort when\r\nCaptain John Brady was killed, and it was he who rushed out, followed by\r\nsome of the garrison, and bore his brother’s body into the fort.\r\n\r\nThus perished one of the most skilled and daring Indians fighters, on\r\nwhose sterling qualities and sound judgment the pioneers so much\r\ndepended.\r\n\r\nHis remains are interred in the old graveyard near Halls, where a heavy\r\ngranite marker was erected bearing the inscription:\r\n\r\n                           Captain John Brady\r\n                   Fell in defense of our forefathers\r\n                      at Wolf Run, April 11, 1779.\r\n                             Aged 46 years.\r\n\r\nOne hundred years after his death funds for a monument were raised by\r\npublic subscription and $1600 secured, and on October 15, 1879, the\r\nshaft was unveiled in Muncy cemetery. The oration was delivered by the\r\nHon. John Blair Linn, in the presence of an immense concourse made up of\r\nmilitary and patriotic organizations and thousands of citizens,\r\nincluding several hundred of the Brady family.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              General Abner Lacock, United States Senator\r\n                   and Distinguished Citizen, Died in\r\n                     Beaver County, April 12, 1837\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Biographical Annals of the Civil Government of the United States\r\npublished in 1876, appears the following brief notice of a once\r\nprominent citizen of Pennsylvania:\r\n\r\n“Abner Lacock, born in Virginia, in 1770. Without the advantage of much\r\nearly education, he raised himself by his talents to eminence as a\r\nlegislator, statesman and civilian. He filled various public stations\r\nfor a period of nearly forty years; was a Representative in Congress\r\nfrom Pennsylvania from 1811 to 1813, and United States Senator from 1813\r\nto 1819. He died in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, April 12, 1837.”\r\n\r\nA search for further information concerning one of whom so little is\r\nknown by the public, but who was honored with the highest offices in the\r\ngift of his neighbors and of the whole people of our State, reveals many\r\ninteresting details and important events in the life of this man.\r\n\r\nAbner Lacock was popularly known as General Lacock. He was born in Cobs\r\nRun, near Alexandria, Virginia, July 9, 1770. His father was a native of\r\nEngland, and his mother a native of France. The father emigrated to\r\nWashington County, Pennsylvania, while Abner was quite young, and\r\nsettled on a farm.\r\n\r\nIn 1796 Abner removed to the town of Beaver, then in Allegheny County,\r\nand was one of the first settlers in that neighborhood.\r\n\r\nHis public career commenced almost immediately after his settlement at\r\nBeaver. On September 19, 1796, he was commissioned by Governor Thomas\r\nMifflin a justice of the peace for Pitt Township, Allegheny County. This\r\nappointment made him the first public official within the present limits\r\nof Beaver County, which was formed out of parts of Allegheny and\r\nWashington Counties, March 12, 1800.\r\n\r\nIn his first office Lacock evinced such a natural strength of mind and\r\nsound intelligence that he was elected in 1801, the first Representative\r\nto the State Legislature from Beaver County, which post he filled until\r\n1803, when he was commissioned the first associate judge for the new\r\ncounty, but he resigned at the end of the year to again enter the\r\nLegislature. The first session of court was held in Abner Lacock’s\r\nhouse, February 6, 1804.\r\n\r\nAfter serving four successive terms in the House, in 1808, he was\r\nelected to the Senate, representing Allegheny, Beaver and Butler\r\nCounties in the upper body of the Pennsylvania Legislature with marked\r\nability.\r\n\r\nThe War of 1812 with the agitation which preceded it brought him into\r\nthe larger field of national politics. In 1810 he was elected by the\r\npeople of his district as the “War Candidate” to Congress, when he\r\nshowed such qualities of leadership that in 1813 the Legislature of his\r\nState with great unanimity elected him a Senator of the United States.\r\nHe served in the House during the Twelfth Congress and in the Senate in\r\nthe Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Congresses.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lacock was a warm friend of Madison and Monroe, and a bitter\r\nenemy of Andrew Jackson. In his later years he was an Adams and Henry\r\nClay Whig.\r\n\r\nOn December 18, 1818, a select committee of five members was appointed\r\nin the Senate of the United States, to investigate the conduct of\r\nGeneral Andrew Jackson in connection with the Seminole War. Of this\r\ncommittee Senator Lacock was chairman, and author of the report made\r\nFebruary 24, 1819, which severely arraigned Jackson with the violation\r\nof the Constitution and International Laws.\r\n\r\nThis action of the committee made Jackson and his friends furious, he\r\nthreatening members of the committee with personal violence. Lacock was\r\nunafraid and wrote frequently about Jackson’s boasting only in public,\r\nand that he should never avoid him a single inch.\r\n\r\nThe clash never came, and they left the capital on the same day, and in\r\nthe same public conveyance.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lacock was one of the most active promoters of internal\r\nimprovements in the State of Pennsylvania. Soon after his term in the\r\nUnited States Senate had ceased, he entered heartily into the scheme for\r\nuniting the waters of the Delaware and the Ohio by a State line of\r\nCanals and railroads. On April 11, 1825, he was appointed one of five\r\ncommissioners to make a complete survey of the route for the\r\ncontemplated improvements.\r\n\r\nOn February 25, 1826, the Legislature authorized the commencement of the\r\nwork on the canal. General Lacock was chosen to supervise the\r\nconstruction of the Western division of the canal from Pittsburgh to\r\nJohnstown.\r\n\r\nThe first canal boat built or run west of the Allegheny Mountains was\r\nnamed the “General Abner Lacock.” It was built at Apollo by Philip\r\nDally.\r\n\r\nLater General Lacock repeatedly served Beaver County in the State\r\nLegislature, and in 1836 was appointed to survey and construct the\r\nPennsylvania and Ohio Canal, known as the “cross-cut canal,” connecting\r\nthe Erie division of the Pennsylvania Canal with the Portsmouth and Ohio\r\nCanal, contracting in its service in that year his last illness.\r\n\r\nBesides those named, General Lacock held, or was offered many other\r\npositions of high public trust, both in this and other states.\r\n\r\nAbner Lacock obtained the title of General in the early part of his\r\npublic career while serving as an officer of the Pennsylvania militia.\r\nAs early as 1807 he was a brigadier general, commanding a brigade in the\r\ncounties of Beaver and Butler.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lacock was the friend and earnest champion of the common school\r\nsystem, which when first proposed was very unpopular in Pennsylvania.\r\nHis library was one of the largest in Western Pennsylvania, and was\r\npartially destroyed by a flood in the Ohio River in 1832.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lacock was of medium height and well proportioned. He was strong\r\nand athletic. He was the father of a large family, but there are no\r\nliving male descendants of this distinguished citizen.\r\n\r\nHe died at his residence, near Freedom, on Wednesday morning, April 12,\r\n1837, after a long and painful illness.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Family of Richard Bard Captured by Indians\r\n                             April 13, 1758\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the French and Indian War of 1755–58, the barrier of the South\r\nMountain shielded the settlers of York County, from the savage\r\nincursions that desolated the Cumberland Valley and other parts of the\r\nfrontier of Pennsylvania. Yet occasionally a party more daring than the\r\nrest would push across the mountain and murder or carry defenseless\r\nfamilies into captivity.\r\n\r\nAn affecting instance of this kind was the captivity of Richard Bard,\r\nwhich is narrated in detail by his son, the late Archibald Bard, of\r\nFranklin County.\r\n\r\nRichard Bard owned and resided near a mill, which was later known as\r\nMarshall’s Mill, on the Carroll tract, in now Adams County.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of April 13, 1758, his house was invested by a party of\r\nnineteen Delaware Indians, who were discovered by a little girl named\r\nHannah McBride. She was at the door and when they approached she\r\nscreamed and ran into the house, where were Richard Bard and his wife, a\r\nchild six months old, a bound boy, and a relative of the Bards,\r\nLieutenant Thomas Potter, a brother of General James Potter.\r\n\r\nThe Indians rushed into the house, and one of them, with a large cutlass\r\nin his grasp, made a blow at Potter, who wrested it from the savage. Mr.\r\nBard laid hold of a pistol that hung on the wall and snapped it at the\r\nbreast of one of the Indians, but there being tow in the pan it did not\r\nfire, but the Indians ran out of the house.\r\n\r\nThe savages were numerous and there was no ammunition in the Bard home,\r\nand fearing a slaughter or being burned alive, those inside surrendered,\r\nas the Indians promised no harm would befall them. The Indians went to a\r\nfield and made prisoners of Samuel Hunter, Daniel McManimy, and a lad\r\nnamed William White, who was coming to the mill.\r\n\r\nHaving secured the prisoners the Indians plundered the house and set\r\nfire to the mill. About seventy rods from the house, contrary to their\r\npromises, they put to death Thomas Potter; and having proceeded on the\r\nmountain three or four miles, one of the Indians sunk the spear of his\r\ntomahawk into the breast of the small child, and after repeated blows\r\nscalped it.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners were taken over the mountain past McCord’s fort, into the\r\nPath Valley, where they encamped for the night. The second day the\r\nIndians discovered a party of white men in pursuit, on which they\r\nhastened the pace of their prisoners, under threat of being tomahawked.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the top of the Tuscarora Mountain, they sat down to\r\nrest, when an Indian, without any previous warning, sunk a tomahawk into\r\nthe forehead of Samuel Hunter, who was seated next to Richard Bard,\r\nkilled and scalped him.\r\n\r\nPassing over Sideling Hill, and the Allegheny Mountains, by Blair’s Gap,\r\nthey encamped beyond Stony Creek. Here Bard’s head had been painted red\r\non one side only, denoting that a council has been held, and an equal\r\nnumber were for killing him, and for saving his life, and that his fate\r\nwould be determined at the next council.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. and Mrs. Bard were engaged together in plucking a turkey, the\r\nformer told his wife of his design to escape. Some of the Indians were\r\nasleep, and one was amusing the others by dressing himself in Mrs.\r\nBard’s gown. Bard was sent to the spring for water and contrived to\r\nescape, while his wife kept the Indians amused with the gown.\r\n\r\nThe Indians made an unsuccessful search for Bard, and proceeded to Fort\r\nDuquesne, then twenty miles down the Ohio River to Kuskusky, in what is\r\nnow Butler County.\r\n\r\nHere Mrs. Bard and two boys and girls were compelled to run the\r\ngauntlet, and were beaten in an unmerciful manner. It was at this place\r\nthat Daniel McManimy was put to death. The Indians formed themselves\r\ninto a circle round the prisoner, and beat him with sticks and\r\ntomahawks, then tied him to a post, and after more torturing he was\r\nscalped alive, a gun barrel was heated and passed over his body, and he\r\nwas pierced in the body until he was relieved from further torture by\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bard was taken from the other prisoners and led from place to\r\nplace, until she was finally adopted into the tribe by two Indian men,\r\nto take the place of a deceased sister.\r\n\r\nShe was next taken to the headwaters of the Susquehanna, and during this\r\njourney she suffered much from fatigue and illness. She lay two months\r\nin this doleful situation, with none to comfort or sympathize with her,\r\na blanket her only covering, and boiled corn her only food.\r\n\r\nShe met with a woman who had been in captivity several years and was\r\nmarried to an Indian. She told Mrs. Bard that soon as she could speak\r\nthe Delaware tongue she would be obliged to marry one of the Indians or\r\nbe put to death. She then resolved not to learn the language. She was\r\nkept in captivity two years and five months, during which time she was\r\ntreated with much kindness by her adopted relations.\r\n\r\nRichard Bard suffered extreme hardships in effecting his escape and\r\nreturn to his home, traveling over mountains thick with laurel and\r\nbriers and covered with snow. His feet were sore, his clothes wet and\r\nfrozen and he was often exhausted and ready to lie down and perish for\r\nwant of food. His food during a journey of nine days was a few buds and\r\nfour snakes, when he reached Fort Littleton, in now Bedford County.\r\n\r\nAfter this he did but little else than wander from place to place in\r\nquest of information respecting his wife. He made several perilous\r\njourneys to Fort Duquesne, in which he narrowly escaped capture several\r\ntimes. He at length learned she was at Fort Augusta, at Shamokin, and\r\nredeemed her.\r\n\r\nBefore the Bards departed from Shamokin, Richard Bard requested the\r\nIndian, who was the adopted brother of his wife, to visit them at their\r\nhome. Accordingly, some time afterwards the Indian paid them a visit,\r\nwhen the Bards were living about ten miles from Chambersburg.\r\n\r\nThe Indian remained there for some time and one day went to McCormack’s\r\ntavern and became intoxicated, when he fell into a brawl with a rough\r\nnamed Newgen, who stabbed the Indian in the neck. Newgen escaped the\r\nwrath of the settlers by fleeing the neighborhood. The Indian was\r\nattended by a physician and recovered, being nursed back to health by\r\nhis adopted sister, Mrs. Richard Bard.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned to his own people he was put to death on the pretext of\r\nhaving, as they said, joined the white people.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Bounties for Scalps of Indians Proclaimed\r\n                             April 14, 1756\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Braddock’s defeat, the protection of the frontiers of Pennsylvania\r\nbeing left to the inhabitants themselves, they rapidly formed companies,\r\ndesignated their own officers and received commissions from Lieutenant\r\nGovernor Morris.\r\n\r\nIt was thought that the Indians would do no mischief in Pennsylvania\r\nuntil they could draw all the others out of the province and away from\r\nthe Susquehanna. But the Delaware and Shawnee had been ravaging in the\r\nneighborhood of Fort Cumberland on both sides of the Potomac. In the\r\nmiddle of October, 1755, occurred the terrible massacres of John Penn’s\r\nCreek, at the mouth of Mahanoy Creek, and when the Great and Little\r\nCoves were destroyed. Shortly after occurred the massacres at\r\nTulpehocken and other places.\r\n\r\nWhen any Indians of the Delaware or Shawnee Nations were discovered they\r\nwere found in their war paint. These were under the command of Chief\r\nShingass.\r\n\r\nThese incursions aroused the Quakers, and November 7, 1775, an address\r\nsigned by Anthony Morris and twenty-two other Quakers was presented to\r\nthe Assembly, expressing willingness to contribute toward the exigencies\r\nof government. But the Assembly and the Executive still fought over the\r\ntax bill.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture Scarouady went to Philadelphia and demanded to know if\r\nthe people of Pennsylvania intended to fight, yes or no. The Governor\r\nexplained to the chieftain how the Assembly and he could not agree.\r\n\r\nScarouady, who had suffered defeat with Braddock and remained a firm\r\nfriend of the English, with many other Indians went to Shamokin to live,\r\nor at least hunt, during the ensuing season.\r\n\r\nGovernor Morris sent Scarouady to the Six Nations to report the conduct\r\nof the Delawares. While he was on this mission the Delaware destroyed\r\nGnadenhutten, in Northampton County, and the farm houses between that\r\nplace and Nazareth were burned January 1, 1756.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Franklin, as Commissioner, then marched with several companies\r\nand built Fort Allen.\r\n\r\nThe Delaware, forcing even John Shikellamy to go against the English,\r\nsent representatives to the Six Nations to justify their conduct, but\r\nwere condemned and ordered to desist.\r\n\r\nWhen Lieutenant Governor Morris heard this chastisement given the\r\nDelaware, and seeing that it so far had not deterred the enemy, he\r\ndetermined to meet barbarity with barbarity, and gave a hatchet to\r\nScarouady, as a declaration of war against the Delaware, and obtained an\r\noffer in writing from Commissioners Fox, Hamilton, Morgan, Mifflin and\r\nHughes to pay rewards for Indian prisoners.\r\n\r\nGovernor Morris issued a proclamation April 14, 1756, offering such\r\nbounties that he hoped would incite not only the soldiers and more\r\nventuresome of the inhabitants, but which would also alarm those Indians\r\nwho still remained friendly to the English.\r\n\r\nThe proclamation contains the following provisions:\r\n\r\n“For every male Indian enemy above twelve years old, who shall be taken\r\nprisoner and delivered at any fort, garrisoned by the troops in pay of\r\nthis Province, or at any of the county towns to the keepers of the\r\ncommon jail there, the sum of 150 Spanish dollars or pieces of eight;\r\nfor the scalp of every male enemy above the age of twelve years,\r\nproduced to evidence of their being killed the sum of 130 pieces of\r\neight; for every female Indian taken prisoner and brought in as\r\naforesaid, and for every male Indian prisoner under the age of twelve\r\nyears, taken and brought in as aforesaid, 130 pieces of eight; for the\r\nscalp of every Indian woman, produced as evidence of their being killed,\r\nthe sum of fifty pieces of eight, and for every English subject that has\r\nbeen killed and carried from this Province into captivity that shall be\r\nrecovered and brought in and delivered at the City of Philadelphia, to\r\nthe Governor of this Province, the sum of 130 pieces of eight, but\r\nnothing for their scalps; and that there shall be paid to every officer\r\nor soldier as are or shall be in the pay of the Province who shall\r\nredeem and deliver any English subject carried into captivity as\r\naforesaid, or shall take, bring in and produce any enemy prisoner, or\r\nscalp as aforesaid, one-half of the said several and respective premiums\r\nand bounties.”\r\n\r\nThis proclamation gave great offense to the Assembly, but not to the\r\npopulation, especially those who lived in the counties distant from\r\nPhiladelphia. The times were perilous, and the bounties were absolutely\r\nnecessary to secure better protection of the borders. To the credit of\r\nthe hardy and brave frontier pioneers of Pennsylvania be it said no\r\nIndian was wantonly killed for the sake of the reward.\r\n\r\nRobert Morris resigned the office of Lieutenant Governor he had held\r\nduring these stirring years, and on August 20, 1756, William Denny\r\narrived from England, and superseded him. Governor Denny was well\r\neducated and held in high favor at Court. His advent here was hailed\r\nwith joy by the Assembly, who flattered themselves that with a change of\r\nthe executives at this time there would come a change of such measures\r\nas had caused their enmity with his predecessors. Upon his assumption of\r\nthe office and making known the Proprietary instructions, to which he\r\nstated he was compelled to adhere, all friendly feeling was at an end,\r\nand there was a renewal of the old discord.\r\n\r\nBefore Governor Morris resigned as Lieutenant Governor he had concerted\r\nwith Colonel John Armstrong an expedition against the strong Indian town\r\nof Kittanning, on the Allegheny River.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Theatrical Performances Begun in State\r\n                             April 15, 1754\r\n\r\n\r\nThe amusements of the young people were for many years of the simplest\r\nand most innocent kind. Riding, swimming and skating afforded pleasant\r\noutdoor sport.\r\n\r\nYearly Meeting, in 1716, advised Friends against “going to or being in\r\nany way concerned in plays, games, lotteries, music and dancing.” In\r\n1719 advice was given “that such be dealt with as run races, either on\r\nhorseback or on foot, laying wagers, or use any gaming or needless and\r\nvain sport and pastimes, for our time passeth swiftly away, and our\r\npleasure and delight ought to be in the law of the Lord.”\r\n\r\nVarious early laws of the Province prohibited stage plays and\r\namusements, not only bull-baiting, bear-baiting and cock-fighting, but\r\nsuch as were neither immoral nor cruel, as bowls, billiards and quoits.\r\n\r\nMacauley said of the Puritans that they opposed bear-baiting “not\r\nbecause it gave pain to the bear, but because it gave pleasure to the\r\nspectators.”\r\n\r\nQuaker legislation as to games was, indeed, scarcely stricter than Henry\r\nVIII’s, but Quakerism discountenanced excitement.\r\n\r\nIn 1723 a wandering showman arrived in Philadelphia and set up a stage\r\njust below South Street, where he was outside the jurisdiction of the\r\nCity Corporation. At the desire of the Quaker Assemblymen, the Speaker,\r\nJoseph Growdon, on March 30, asked Lieutenant Governor Keith to prohibit\r\nany performance. This he declined to do, but promised that good order\r\nshould be kept.\r\n\r\nSo the actor issued his playbills and gave what is supposed to have been\r\nthe first entertainment in Pennsylvania that might be called theatrical.\r\n\r\nAs the man who entertained by his “Comical Humour” in April, 1724,\r\ncalled himself the audience’s “Old friend Pickle Herring,” he may be\r\npresumed to have been the owner of both shows. In 1724, he introduced\r\nthe “Roap-Dancing” as “newly arrived.” The rope-walkers were a lad of\r\nseven years and a woman. There was also a woman who would spin around\r\nrapidly for a quarter of an hour with seven or eight swords pointed at\r\nher eyes, mouth and breast. Governor Keith himself attended one or more\r\nof these performances.\r\n\r\nSmall shows now, from time to time, made their appearance. In 1727, “The\r\nLion, King of Beasts,” was advertised to be exhibited on Water Street.\r\n\r\nThe Quakers and rigid Presbyterians, who in the early days frowned down\r\ndancing and other “frivolous amusements,” could not be expected to\r\ncountenance the introduction of the drama in Philadelphia. So when\r\nMurray and Kean’s company of Thespians made their appearance in 1749\r\nthey were not permitted to make a long stay, but were ordered off as\r\nsoon as the worthy rulers of the city’s morals realized the fact that\r\ntheir entertainments possessed irresistible attractions. So Murray and\r\nKean went to New York and for five years the Philadelphians did not see\r\na play.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1749, mention is made of the tragedy of Cato being acted; but\r\nJanuary 8, 1750, attention being called to some persons having lately\r\ntaken upon themselves to act plays, and intending “to make a frequent\r\npractice thereof,” the City Council asked the magistrates to suppress\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1753 Lewis Hallam’s English company, after traveling a year\r\nin the Southern colonies and performing in various places in Virginia\r\nand Maryland, went to New York, where they opened their theatre in the\r\nmonth of September. The report of the great success of their talented\r\nactors awakened a desire among the more liberal-minded Philadelphians\r\nthat Hallam should visit the Quaker City.\r\n\r\nOn April 15, 1754, they gave their first performance in the large brick\r\nwarehouse of William Plumstead, situated in King or Water Street,\r\nbetween Pine and Lombard Streets. This house remained standing until\r\n1849, when it was pulled down.\r\n\r\nThe opening piece was the tragedy of “The Fair Penitent,” followed by\r\nthe farce “Miss in Her Teens.”\r\n\r\nMr. Rigby spoke a prologue and Mrs. Hallam an epilogue written for the\r\noccasion, in which, after defending the stage from the accusation of\r\nsinfulness and alluding to the effect produced by the tragedy upon the\r\naudience, she asked:\r\n\r\n             “If then the soul in Virtue’s cause we move\r\n             Why should the friends of Virtue disapprove?”\r\n\r\nThis temporary theatre was neatly fitted up and opened to a full house.\r\nThe license was for twenty-four nights but this number was extended to\r\nthirty, and the theatre closed June 24 after having had a brilliant and\r\nprofitable season. One of the performances was given for the benefit of\r\nthe charity school.\r\n\r\nHallam’s company came back to Philadelphia in 1759 to occupy a permanent\r\ntheatre erected for them in Southwark, at the corner of Cedar (or South)\r\nand Vernon Streets, on Society Hill.\r\n\r\nThis theatre was opened June 25, 1759, but either because the house was\r\ntoo small and not well equipped or because of discouraging opposition\r\nthe company only played in it one season. They remained away five years.\r\n\r\nOn their return a new house, much larger than the first one, was built\r\nat the corner of South and Apollo Streets. This new theatre was opened\r\nNovember 12, 1766.\r\n\r\nIt was in this theatre and by “The American Company” that the first play\r\nby an American author performed on any regular stage was given April 24,\r\n1767. This was “The Prince of Porthia,” by Thomas Godfrey, Jr., of\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\nThe American Company played at this theatre several seasons. The theatre\r\nremained closed from the beginning of the Revolutionary War until it was\r\nopened by the British officers during their occupancy of the city,\r\n1777–78.\r\n\r\nThese amateur performers gave regular plays, the proceeds going to\r\nwidows and orphan children of the soldiers. The ill-fated Major Andre\r\nand Captain Delancy painted the scenes and other decorations. The\r\ncurtain, representing a waterfall scene, the work of young Andre,\r\nremained in use until the theatre was destroyed by fire May 9, 1823.\r\n\r\nAfter the return of the Continental Congress the Legislature of\r\nPennsylvania legislated against theatrical performances. No plays were\r\ngiven until 1789, when a petition signed by 1900 citizens, asking the\r\nrepeal of the prohibiting provision relating to theatres, was presented\r\nto the Legislature. The religious community presented a petition signed\r\nby more than 1000 citizens as a remonstrance against the repeal.\r\n\r\nThe restrictive portion of the act was repealed and Hallam and Henry\r\nopened the Southwark Theatre January 6, 1790, with “The Rivals” and “The\r\nCritic.”\r\n\r\nThe season was unusually brilliant, and the theatre in Philadelphia and\r\nelsewhere throughout Pennsylvania has since been popular.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Tedyuskung, Indian Chieftain, Burns to\r\n                     Death in Cabin, April 16, 1763\r\n\r\n\r\nTedyuskung was made king of the Delaware nation in the spring of 1756,\r\nand from that date until his untimely death this great Indian chieftain\r\nexerted a most powerful influence throughout the entire Province of\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe name is of Munsee dialect, and signifies “the healer,” or “one who\r\ncures wounds, bruises, etc.”\r\n\r\nHe was one of the most famous and crafty of the Delaware chiefs during\r\nthe period of discussion of the Indian claims, following the sale of the\r\nlands along the Delaware and Susquehanna to the Proprietors of\r\nPennsylvania by the Iroquois.\r\n\r\nTedyuskung was born at the present site of Trenton, N.J., about 1705,\r\nand died April 16, 1763. Nothing is known of his life before the time he\r\nfirst appears as an historic character, prior to which he was known as\r\n“Honest John.”\r\n\r\nWhen about fifty years old he was chosen chief of the Delaware on the\r\nSusquehanna, and from that time wielded a potent influence, although he\r\noccupied a peculiar position.\r\n\r\nSir William Johnson, of New York, was a zealous friend of the Iroquois,\r\nwhile Conrad Weiser and George Croghan, of Pennsylvania, were strongly\r\nprejudiced against the Delaware and Shawnee. The problem which the\r\nProvincial Government of Pennsylvania had to solve was how to keep peace\r\nwith the Iroquois and at the same time prevent the Delaware and the\r\nShawnee who were then becoming independent of the Iroquois, from going\r\nover to the French.\r\n\r\nThe Delaware were conscious they had been unjustly deprived of their\r\nlands by the Pennsylvania authorities, aided by the Iroquois. They had\r\nbeen driven from the Delaware to the Susquehanna, and many had been\r\nforced even as far west as the Ohio, and now that France and England had\r\ncommenced to struggle for the possession of that region the Delaware\r\nfelt they were to be again driven from their home. They were revolting\r\nnot only against the English, but against their masters, the Iroquois.\r\n\r\nAt this critical time, when the border settlements in Western\r\nPennsylvania were being ravaged by hostile bands of Delaware and\r\nShawnee, and when the English were making preparations for an expedition\r\nto take Fort Duquesne, Tedyuskung took his stand as a friend of the\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nChristian Frederic Post had been sent on a mission to the Ohio Indians,\r\nand Conrad Weiser and others were working to retain the friendship of\r\nthese Indians. The many squatters along the Juniata River and the\r\nillegal sale of land at Wyoming made by the Mohawk to the Connecticut\r\nsettlers complicated the situation and made the work of these emissaries\r\nmuch more difficult and trying. Then the Indians who had been in\r\nconference at Albany in 1754, found when they returned home that lands\r\nhad been sold to the Proprietors which they did not comprehend.\r\n\r\nWashington suffered defeat at Fort Necessity and this was followed by\r\nthe terrible Braddock disaster; which with the evil effects of the rum\r\ntraffic among the Indians and the almost total neglect by the Province\r\nof Pennsylvania had almost entirely alienated them from the English\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nThen began the several attempts to win them back, but the passage of the\r\nScalp Act and the declaration of war against the Delaware caused this\r\ntribe to rise in rebellion against the Province and also against their\r\nhated title of “women,” given them by the Iroquois.\r\n\r\nSuch was the situation when the great council was called at Easton,\r\nJuly, 1756, at which Tedyuskung appeared as the champion of the\r\nDelaware. Governor Morris opened the council with a speech, in which he\r\nwarmly welcomed the chief. Tedyuskung replied: “The Delaware are no\r\nlonger the slaves of the Six Nations. I, Tedyuskung, have been appointed\r\nKing over the Five United Nations. What I do here will be approved by\r\nall. This is a good day. I wish the same good that possessed the good\r\nold man, William Penn, who was a friend of the Indian, may inspire the\r\npeople of the Province at this time.”\r\n\r\nThe first session was followed by a grand feast and reception, during\r\nwhich King Tedyuskung and Chief Newcastle were sent to give the “big\r\npeace halloo” to the Indians and invite them to a larger conference,\r\nwhich was held at a later time.\r\n\r\nTedyuskung left Easton, but loitered about Fort Allen, where he became\r\ndrunk and disorderly, and so incensed Lieutenant Miller that the whole\r\noutcome of the peace conference was, for a time, endangered.\r\n\r\nDuring this drunken spree Tedyuskung was blamed for having dealings with\r\nthe French, but no evidence was produced to prove the charges; yet\r\nGovernor Morris dispatched Chief Newcastle to Sir William Johnson to\r\nlearn if the Iroquois had deputized Tedyuskung to act for them. This\r\nthey denied.\r\n\r\nThen followed endless discussions in Provincial Council. Governor Morris\r\nhad been succeeded by Governor Denny, who went to the council at Easton,\r\nJuly, 1757, under a heavy guard. Tedyuskung, in his opening speech,\r\nsaid: “I am sorry for what our people have done. I have gone among our\r\npeople pleading for peace. If it cost me my life I would do it.”\r\n\r\nTedyuskung demanded a clerk at this Easton Council on threat of leaving,\r\nand he was assigned such official. While Tedyuskung was drunk each\r\nnight, he appeared at council each morning with a clear head and was the\r\nequal of any in debate.\r\n\r\nThis second Easton council determined upon a general peace and\r\nTedyuskung promised to see that their white prisoners were all returned.\r\nHe then went to Fort Allen, where he and his warriors had a drunken\r\nfrolic. Conrad Weiser says of him at this time: “Though he is a drunkard\r\nand a very irregular man, yet he is a man that can think well, and I\r\nbelieve him to be sincere in what he said.”\r\n\r\nA fourth council was held at Easton in October, 1758, when Post had\r\nreturned from his Western mission. Land disputes again became a\r\nprincipal topic, and Tedyuskung was discredited by the Iroquois, who\r\nattempted to destroy his influence with the Provincial Government. They\r\neven left the council when he spoke, but the old King won out and the\r\ncouncil finally ended in a treaty of peace.\r\n\r\nIn 1762 the Governor offered Tedyuskung £400 as a present if he would\r\nwithdraw his charges of fraud in the “Walking Purchase,” and he accepted\r\nthe bribe.\r\n\r\nAfter all the dealing with the Governors and councils of Pennsylvania,\r\nand his personal controversies with the enemy tribes, this last of the\r\nchiefs of the eastern Delaware traveled from Philadelphia to his home at\r\nWyoming, and on the night of April 16, 1763, his house was set on fire\r\nwhile he lay on his couch in a drunken debauch and he was burned to\r\ndeath in the flames. The perpetrators of this crime were either Seneca\r\nor Mohawk.\r\n\r\nHe was the most virile chief of the Delaware nation during the years of\r\ntheir subjugation to the Iroquois. His efforts for peace did much to win\r\nthe Ohio region from the French.\r\n\r\nA monument to Tedyuskung has been erected in Fairmount Park,\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Lottery for Union Canal for $400,000 Authorized\r\n                     by Legislature, April 17, 1795\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the act of April 17, 1795, the president and managers of the\r\nSchuykill and Susquehanna Navigation, and the president and managers of\r\nthe Delaware and Schuykill Canal Navigation, were authorized to raise by\r\nmeans of a lottery, a sum of $400,000 for the purpose of completing the\r\nworks cited in their acts of incorporation, under a prohibition that\r\nneither of them should form the same into capital stock, upon which to\r\ndeclare a dividend of profits.\r\n\r\nAn Act Passed March 4, 1807, authorized the said companies to raise\r\ntheir respective sums separately, subject to the prohibition as to\r\ndividends.\r\n\r\nThe two companies were consolidated by act of April 2, 1811 into a\r\ncorporation known as the Union Canal Company of Pennsylvania. The new\r\ncompany was authorized to raise money by loan to complete the canal and\r\nto use the proceeds of the lotteries already authorized, and by the\r\ntwenty-eighth section of the act authority was given to raise the\r\nresidue of the original sum equal to $340,000 by a lottery.\r\n\r\nBy the act of March 29, 1819 the proceeds of the above lottery were\r\npledged as a fund for the payment of an annual interest of 6 per cent\r\nupon the stock of the company.\r\n\r\nBy these and subsequent acts it appears that the lottery grants were\r\ngiven in the first instance, to the two companies, and afterwards\r\ncontinued to the Union Canal Company to aid and encourage the\r\nconstruction and completion of a canal and lock navigation uniting the\r\nwaters of the Susquehanna and Schuylkill.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of these lottery grants, individuals were induced to\r\ninvest their funds in the furtherance of the work, and loans to the\r\namount of $830,400 were made upon the credit of the capital stock and\r\nthe profits of the lotteries.\r\n\r\nThe Union Canal Company entered into contracts for the conduct of these\r\nlotteries, the last one, October 6, 1824, for five years, which expired\r\nDecember 31, 1829.\r\n\r\nThere was much sentiment against these lotteries and as there were laws\r\nin force for suppressing and preventing lotteries, there was objection\r\nmade when the extension of this lottery was brought to the General\r\nAssembly. The Committee on Ways and Means, February 9, 1828, reported\r\nthat it was inexpedient to resume the lottery grants to the Union Canal\r\nCompany at this time and further resolved, “that the committee be\r\ninstructed to bring in a bill to regulate lottery brokers, and to\r\nrestrain the sale of lottery tickets within this Commonwealth.”\r\n\r\nFor more than half a century after the founding of the Province,\r\nPennsylvania was dominated by the Quakers, who were constantly opposed\r\nto all games of chance. At the very first meeting of the Assembly, at\r\nChester, in 1682, an act was passed against cards, dice, lotteries, etc.\r\nThis and similar acts were annulled by the English Government.\r\n\r\nAlthough lotteries were not legally prohibited only one lottery appears\r\nto have been drawn during the next several decades. In 1720 a Mr. Reed\r\nby means of a lottery of 350 tickets, which were sold for twenty\r\nshillings each, disposed of a new brick house and several lots in\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\nIn 1730 lotteries were prohibited under a penalty of £100, half of which\r\nwas to go to the Governor, and half to the party bringing suit.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that the Provincial Assembly authorized lotteries by\r\nspecial legislation for at least two lotteries had the official sanction\r\nof the Philadelphia Council; one in 1747, for the fortification of the\r\nCity, the other a year later for street paving. From this time until the\r\npassage of the anti-lottery act of 1762, lotteries increased in number.\r\n\r\nDuring this period lotteries were drawn for the college, academy and\r\ncharitable school of Philadelphia, to complete the Episcopal Church,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThe act of 1762 proved to be effective in limiting the number and\r\npurposes for which lotteries might be established. Between 1762 and\r\n1796, there were only twenty-three lotteries in Pennsylvania. Of these\r\nsix were private, eight were for public use and nine for the erection of\r\nchurch buildings, in which twenty-one churches were concerned.\r\n\r\nWith the establishment of the Federal Government the financial condition\r\nof the country rapidly improved. With the gradual growth of population,\r\nand rapid development of business, came increased demands for new\r\nchurches, schools, public buildings and improved transportation. To meet\r\nthese public needs the regular revenue was insufficient and to avoid an\r\nabnormal increase in taxation, petitions were presented to the\r\nLegislature for the privilege of establishing public or semi-public\r\nlotteries.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature rejected all requests for lotteries, except when some\r\nimportant purpose was to be served. Only one lottery was authorized in\r\n1790, for the erection of a Jewish synagogue; none then until 1795, when\r\none was granted the Aaronsburg Town Lottery, in now Center County, and\r\nthe other was to aid in opening the canal navigation between the\r\nSchuylkill and Susquehanna Rivers.\r\n\r\nFrom 1796 to 1808 inclusive seventy-eight different lotteries were\r\nauthorized.\r\n\r\nThe lottery of 1782 for the improvement of roads west of Philadelphia\r\nwas managed as a state lottery. Others were county, city, borough and\r\ntownship schemes. Some were for erection of bridges, ferries and even\r\nimproving creeks. One was for a garden and public bath in Philadelphia,\r\none for the pay of soldiers in the French and Indian War; hospitals were\r\nalso included, as were schools.\r\n\r\nMany churches were built by means of lotteries and the newspapers of\r\nthat period carried many advertisements, both from those authorized by\r\nthe Pennsylvania Legislature and those of other States. It is estimated\r\nthat at least fifty lotteries chartered by other States had agencies in\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\nFrom 1747 to 1883 there were 176 separate lotteries. One single lottery,\r\nUnion Canal lottery, awarded in prizes more than $33,000,000 between\r\n1811 and December 31, 1833.\r\n\r\nThe State became flooded with local and foreign lottery tickets, and\r\nmany memorials were presented to the Legislature against all form of\r\nlotteries, but they continued to thrive until December 31, 1833, when\r\nthey were abolished by law, Pennsylvania taking the lead of all States\r\nin banishing lotteries.\r\n\r\nGovernor George Wolf said in a message to the General Assembly: “A more\r\npernicious, ruinous and demoralizing evil can scarcely be imagined.”\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    First Northern Camp in Civil War\r\n                       Established April 18, 1861\r\n\r\n\r\nOn April 18, 1861, Camp Curtin was regularly and formally established in\r\nthe northwestern suburbs of Harrisburg. It was the first regular camp\r\nformed north of the Susquehanna in the loyal States, and before the end\r\nof the month twenty-five regiments were sent to the front from the\r\ncounties of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe willing and prompt response to the call of President Lincoln and the\r\nappeal of Governor Curtin created immediately the necessity for a great\r\nrendezvous for the State’s troops. Harrisburg was the logical place for\r\nsuch a camp, for it had the advantage of being the seat of government\r\nand railroad lines extending in all directions.\r\n\r\nThe troops began to pour into Harrisburg so suddenly that temporary\r\nshelter was erected on all public grounds, within three days after the\r\nPresident’s call for volunteers.\r\n\r\nGovernor Curtin acted promptly in procuring accommodations for the\r\ntroops, and on April 18 requested Captain E. C. Williams to take charge\r\nof the grounds controlled by the Dauphin County Agricultural Society,\r\nnear the tracks of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company on the east and\r\nless than a quarter of a mile from the Susquehanna on the west.\r\n\r\nIt was the original intention to call this rendezvous “Camp Union,” but\r\nCaptain E. C. Williams, Captain J. P. Knipe and others very\r\nappropriately changed the name in honor of the patriotic and beloved\r\nGovernor of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nWhen the war broke out in all its suddenness, and Washington was cut off\r\nfrom the loyal States of the North by the riotous proceedings at\r\nBaltimore, there was an utter lack of military organization in\r\nPennsylvania. The military system of the State had decayed and aside\r\nfrom Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, there were very few military companies\r\nin the State fully armed and equipped. Of these only a few contained the\r\nminimum number of thirty-two men. But, as the appeal for men was\r\ndisseminated through the towns and villages of the interior counties,\r\nthe officers of such military companies as did exist very promptly\r\nrallied their men and tendered their services to the Governor.\r\n\r\nRinggold Light Artillery, Captain McKnight, of Reading; the Logan\r\nGuards, Captain Selheimer, of Lewistown; the Washington Artillery,\r\nCaptain Wren, and the National Light Infantry, Captain McDonald, both of\r\nPottsville, and the Allen Rifles, Captain Yeager, of Allentown, were the\r\nfirst to offer their services in an armed and disciplined condition for\r\nimmediate action. When the Ringgold Light Artillery, numbering one\r\nhundred and two men, reached Harrisburg and word was sent to the\r\nSecretary of War of the presence of so strong a company at the State\r\nCapital, he at once telegraphed for its immediate presence in\r\nWashington, but for prudence the order was suppressed.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 18th, the day Camp Curtin was established, a\r\ndetachment of Company H, Fourth United States Artillery, numbering\r\nfifty, arrived from the West, in command of Lieutenant Pemberton.\r\n\r\nThe five volunteer companies, first to report at Camp Curtin, were\r\npromptly mustered into the United States service by Captain, afterwards\r\nColonel Seneca G. Simmons, of the Seventh United States Infantry, and\r\nthe regulars, mentioned above, and these volunteers departed on the same\r\ntrain for Fort McHenry, to assist in the defense of Washington.\r\n\r\nThe volunteers marched through Baltimore, then filled with Southern\r\nsympathizers, ready and eager to obstruct their passage through the\r\ncity. On leaving the cars at Bolton station to march to the Camden\r\nstation, a battalion was formed. As the march began the Baltimore police\r\nappeared in large force, headed by Marshall Kane, followed by a mob, who\r\nat once attacked the volunteers and were countenanced by the police sent\r\nto give safe conduct through the city. The troops were ordered to\r\nmaintain their discipline.\r\n\r\nWhen in the center of the city, the regulars under Lieutenant Pemberton\r\nmarched off toward Fort McHenry leaving the volunteers to pursue their\r\nmarch to Camden station. This seemed to be a signal to the mob, and at\r\nonce the air was filled with flying missiles, while every species of\r\noath and imprecation were flung at the volunteers as they marched\r\nforward. Not a man made a reply, but steadily, sternly, and undauntedly\r\nthe five companies of Pennsylvanians moved over the cobble-stoned\r\nstreets of the city. At every step the mob increased, but with\r\nunblanched faces and martial step the brave men never for one moment\r\nwavered, marching like veterans as the mob gave way before and around\r\nthem as they forced their passage to the depot.\r\n\r\nThe mob believed that a portion of the Logan Guards carried loaded guns,\r\nbecause their half-cocked pieces displayed percussion caps, but in\r\nreality there was not a load of powder and ball in the entire five\r\ncompanies. Nevertheless, the feint of displaying the caps, which was\r\ndone partly as a jest on leaving the cars at Bolton Station, saved the\r\nmen from the bloody attack which was hurled the next day at the force of\r\nMassachusetts troops passing through the city. As it was, when the\r\ntroops were boarding the cars at Camden station, the infuriated rabble\r\nwho had dogged their steps, hurled bricks, stones, clubs and mud into\r\ntheir disorganized ranks, without, fortunately, injuring a single\r\nvolunteer.\r\n\r\nAttempts were made to throw the cars from the track, to detach the\r\nlocomotive, and even to break the driving mechanism of the engine, all\r\nof which failed, and the train pulled out of the station amid the\r\ndemoniac yells of the disappointed ruffians whose thirst for blood was\r\nnow aroused to a savage fury.\r\n\r\nThe solicitude of Governor Curtin for the safe transportation of these\r\ntroops through Baltimore was intense. He remained at the telegraph\r\noffice in Harrisburg receiving dispatches which depicted the stirring\r\nscenes in the streets of Baltimore. When it was finally announced that\r\nthe trains had passed out of reach of their assailants with the men\r\nsafely aboard, he emphatically declared that not another Pennsylvania\r\nsoldier should march through Baltimore unarmed, but fully prepared to\r\ndefend himself.\r\n\r\nAt 7 o’clock in the evening of the eighteenth, the five Pennsylvania\r\ncompanies reached Washington, the first troops which arrived from any\r\nState to defend the National Capital. On July 22 Congress adopted a\r\nresolution commending these Pennsylvania volunteers for the gallantry\r\ndisplayed in passing through the Baltimore mob and reaching Washington\r\nso promptly. It is of interest to note that our own Pennsylvanian,\r\nGalusha A. Grow, was then Speaker of the House of Representatives and\r\nsigned this resolution.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Training of Troops Began at Camp Curtin,\r\n                             April 19, 1861\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the First Defenders departed from Camp Curtin and were the first\r\ntroops which arrived at Washington from any State to defend the National\r\nCapital, the real activities of this famous training camp began.\r\n\r\nBeginning on the morning of April 19 every inbound train brought troops\r\nto Harrisburg, and soon Camp Curtin was a hive of activity.\r\n\r\nEli Seifer, Secretary of the Commonwealth, assumed the discharge of\r\ncertain military functions, such as replying to telegraphic offer of\r\ntroops, etc., but beginning April 19, Captain G. A. C. Seiler, the\r\ncommandant, assumed the responsibilities, and displayed great energy.\r\nHis administration was characterized by earnestness and activity, until\r\nby exposure and over-work, he contracted a disease from which he died.\r\nHe was succeeded July 31 by Colonel John H. Taggart, of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nColonel Taggart was the editor of the Sunday Times, in Philadelphia, and\r\nwhen the news of hostilities reached there, he raised a company of\r\nvolunteers called “The Wayne Guards” and marched them from Philadelphia\r\nto Harrisburg. They arrived at Camp Curtin June 7.\r\n\r\nGovernor Curtin was not over sanguine that the war was likely to be\r\nconcluded at the first contest so when the responses to the first call\r\nfor volunteers brought enough to make twenty-five regiments instead of\r\nonly the eight asked for, the Governor did not disband them, but\r\ndirected that they preserve their organizations, and immediately applied\r\nto the Legislature for authority to form a corps of thirteen regiments\r\nof infantry, one of cavalry, and one of artillery, to be organized and\r\nequipped by the State, to be subject to the call of the National\r\nGovernment if needed, and at all times to be in readiness for immediate\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nOn May 15, the Legislature passed an act authorizing the organization of\r\nthe “Reserve Volunteer Corps of the Commonwealth,” and Governor Curtin\r\nissued his call for men to compose the corps, and apportioned the number\r\nthat would be received from each county, in order that each section of\r\nthe State and every class of its people should be duly represented in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nFour camps of instruction were established; one at Easton, under command\r\nof Colonel William B. Mann, of Philadelphia; one at West Chester, under\r\nCaptain Henry M. McIntire, of West Chester; one at Pittsburgh, under\r\nColonel John W. McLean; and one at Camp Curtin, Harrisburg, under\r\nColonel G. A. C. Seiler, of Harrisburg.\r\n\r\nGeorge A. McCall, a graduate of the West Point Military Academy, of the\r\nclass of 1822, a distinguished soldier in the war with Mexico, was\r\nappointed a Major General to command the corps. General McCall\r\nimmediately organized his staff by appointing Henry J. Biddle, Assistant\r\nAdjutant General, and Henry Sheets and Eldrige McConkey, Aids-de-Camp.\r\nSubsequently, Professor Henry Coppee was attached to the staff as\r\nInspector General.\r\n\r\nOn June 22 two of the regiments were ordered to Cumberland, Md., and\r\nsoon afterward rendered excellent service at New Creek and Piedmont, in\r\nWest Virginia until ordered to the lower Potomac regions.\r\n\r\nOn July 22, the day after the disaster at Bull Run, a requisition was\r\nmade on the State for its Reserve Corps, and as quickly as the means of\r\ntransportation could be provided, eleven thousand of these troops, fully\r\narmed and equipped, were sent to the defenses of Washington, and a few\r\ndays later the regiments were mustered into the United States service\r\nfor three years, or during the war.\r\n\r\nThis was the beginning of the Pennsylvania Reserves, an organization,\r\nwhich, during the later years of the war, won fame on many battlefields,\r\nand many of whose members sleep beneath the sod in Southern States.\r\nTheir skill was everywhere recognized, and no others were more renowned\r\nfor bravery.\r\n\r\nReverend A. S. Williams who gave the historical address on the occasion\r\nof the dedication of the statue to Governor Curtin on the site of Camp\r\nCurtin, among other interesting facts said: “When General McDowell’s\r\nsoldiers were defeated at Bull’s Run, the trained Pennsylvania Reserve\r\nRegiment from Camp Curtin, steadied the Government at Washington. When\r\nGeneral Lee attempted to invade the North in 1862, Governor Curtin\r\ncalled for fifty thousand volunteers, and a strong reserve was\r\nmaintained at Camp Curtin ready to march at a moment’s notice.\r\n\r\n“During the early months of the war, on one occasion trucks were pushed\r\non the tracks of the railroad to the east of the Camp and a Brigade of\r\nSoldiers stepped on them and was carried by way of Huntingdon over the\r\nBroad Top Railroad to Hopewell; from here they marched through Bedford\r\nto Cumberland, Md. For two months these soldiers protected this\r\ncommunity from the harrassing enemy.\r\n\r\n“In June 1863 when the people of the State became apprehensive lest\r\nHarrisburg and Philadelphia fall into the hands of General Lee, again\r\nthe troops from Camp Curtin met the enemy but a few miles from\r\nHarrisburg along the Carlisle Pike.”\r\n\r\nCamp Curtin was available and often used as an Army hospital.\r\n\r\nAmong the commanders at Camp Curtin besides those above mentioned were\r\nColonel Thomas Welsh, of Lancaster; Colonel Charles J. Biddle, of\r\nPhiladelphia; and Colonel James A. Beaver, afterwards General and later\r\nGovernor of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nGovernor Curtin, after all, was the leading spirit in this greatest of\r\nArmy Camps and it is appropriate that the words on a bronze tablet on\r\nhis statue should read: “His administration of the Gubernatorial office\r\nduring the dark days of the Republic made an imperishable name for his\r\nfamily, and added historic grandeur to the annals of the Commonwealth.”\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Colonel Brodhead Destroyed Indian Town\r\n                      of Coshocton, April 20, 1781\r\n\r\n\r\nColonel Daniel Brodhead, the commandant at Fort Pitt, had not been able\r\nto execute his design to lead a force against the Wyandot and Shawnee\r\nIndian towns in Ohio. He had expected to obtain the help of the Delaware\r\nwarriors at Coshocton for this expedition, but in the spring of 1781, a\r\nchange in the situation impelled him to strike at the Delaware.\r\n\r\nUntil December, 1780, the Delaware took no part, as a nation, in the\r\nwarfare against the frontiers of Pennsylvania, and the alliance with the\r\nUnited States, made by their three principal chiefs in the autumn of\r\n1778, was outwardly observed for more than two years. The death of their\r\nnoted chief, White Eyes, which occurred from an attack of smallpox, at\r\nPittsburgh, November, 1778, was followed by the election of Killbuck, or\r\nGelelemand, the celebrated sachem, who proved himself to be an\r\nunswerving friend of the Americans. Chief Killbuck found himself the\r\nleader of the minority of his nation, but his influence was sufficient\r\nto delay the union of the Delaware with the other hostile Indian\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nThe Americans gave no presents to the Indians and had little else of\r\nvalue to offer them, while the British, especially those at the Detroit\r\npost, gave them not only alluring promises but showered many valuable\r\npresents upon them. It was then only a matter of time until the Shawnee,\r\nSeneca, Miami, Wyandot and other Indians hostile to the Americans could\r\npersuade the Delaware to join with them in war against the Colonists.\r\nCaptain Pipe was the principal Delaware chief who had long led the war\r\nparty and finally controlled their determination to take up the hatchet.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1781, a council was held at Coshocton, at which Killbuck\r\nwas not present, being then on an important mission to Fort Pitt, and\r\nthe Delaware yielded to the pressure and voted to join in warfare\r\nagainst the borders of Pennsylvania and Virginia.\r\n\r\nKillbuck was afraid to return to Coshocton, as he learned of threats\r\nagainst his life, so he made his home with the Moravians and their\r\nconverted Indians at Salem, on the western branch of the Tuscarawas\r\nRiver, fourteen miles below New Philadelphia. Here he professed\r\nChristianity and was baptized and received the Christian name William\r\nHenry, in honor of a distinguished citizen of Lancaster, Pa. He was\r\nafterward commissioned by the United States Congress and was proud to\r\ncall himself “Colonel Henry.” When he removed his family to Salem he\r\ntook also with him the family of White Eyes and other Delaware Indians,\r\nincluding the aged warriors Big Cat and Nonowland.\r\n\r\nKillbuck wrote a long letter to Colonel Brodhead informing him of the\r\nhostile action of the council at Coshocton. The missionary, the Reverend\r\nJohn Heckewelder, who penned this letter, also sent another by the same\r\nmessenger, John Montour, in which he suggested an expedition against\r\nCoshocton.\r\n\r\nColonel Brodhead at once determined to attack the place and punish the\r\nDelaware for their perfidy. The Pennsylvania Government gave him much\r\nassistance and a supply of provisions, but his force of regular troops\r\nat Fort Pitt had been reduced, from various causes, to about 200 men. He\r\nmade a call for assistance to the officers of the border counties, but\r\nno troops were furnished by them. Colonel David Shepherd, county\r\nlieutenant of Ohio County, Virginia (now Green County, Pa.) however,\r\nsent him a body of excellent volunteers consisting of 134 Virginia\r\nmilitiamen, arranged in four companies, under Captains John Ogle,\r\nBenjamin Royce, Jacob Leffler and William Crawford. These men were hardy\r\nyoung farmers from the settlements in Washington County; most of them\r\nrode their own horses, and cheerfully responded to Colonel Shepherd’s\r\ncall.\r\n\r\nThese troops rendezvoused at Fort Henry, the stockade at Wheeling, where\r\nColonel Brodhead and his command joined them. On Tuesday, April 19, the\r\nlittle army of 300 was ferried over the Ohio River and marched over the\r\nIndian trail for Muskingum River. John Montour, Nonowland and Delaware\r\nbraves joined the Americans to fight their own treacherous tribesmen.\r\n\r\nThe purpose was to march rapidly and take the village of Coshocton by\r\nsurprise; yet it required ten days to reach that place on account of\r\nsevere weather and unusually heavy rains. A short pause was made at\r\nSalem, where Colonel Brodhead held a conference with the Reverend John\r\nHeckewelder.\r\n\r\nHe learned there were no Christian Indians at Coshocton. The Moravians\r\nwere to prepare corn and cattle for the soldiers against the return\r\nmarch. The missionary then hastened back to Gnadenhuetten and Salem to\r\ncarry the news that the Americans were in the country and Killbuck and\r\nhis warriors again donned the war paint to join the Continentals against\r\nother savages.\r\n\r\nAlthough it required ten days to reach the Muskingum, the Delaware were\r\ntaken by surprise. They had no expectation that the Americans would act\r\nso promptly and, on account of stormy weather, they were careless and\r\nkept out no scouts. Then some of the principal chiefs were at Detroit,\r\nin attendance at a big council with De Peyster, the British governor.\r\n\r\nOn Friday morning, April 20, during a heavy downpour, the advance guard\r\ncame upon three Indians in the woods, not more than a mile distant from\r\nCoshocton. One of the savages was captured, but the two others escaped\r\nto the town and gave the alarm. The captured Indian said there were not\r\nmany warriors at home, that a band of forty had just returned from a\r\nborder raid, with scalps and prisoners, but had crossed to the farther\r\nside of the river, a few miles above the town, to enjoy a drunken revel.\r\n\r\nBrodhead hurried forward and dashed into the Indian capital, finding but\r\nfifteen warriors there, who made a brave resistance, but every one was\r\neither killed by rifle ball or tomahawked by an American soldier. The\r\nmounted men were first in the town and they would not accept surrender\r\nor suffer the wounded to linger long in agony. No harm was done to any\r\nof the old men, women or children, of whom more than a score were\r\ncaptured. These were removed and every building in Coshocton set on\r\nfire. A great quantity of peltry and other stores was taken and forty\r\nhead of cattle furnished good food for the hungry soldiers.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the Coshocton campaign the hostile Delaware migrated to\r\nthe headwaters of the Sandusky and other places farther westward, while\r\nthe adherents of Chief Killbuck and those friendly to the Americans\r\nmoved to Pittsburgh and erected their rude wigwams on Smoky Island,\r\nsometimes called Killbuck Island, at the northern side of the junction\r\nof the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Cornerstones Laid for Germantown\r\n                        Academy, April 21, 1760\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the year 1760, the French and Indian War had narrowed its area and\r\nwas confined chiefly to Canada. This was then a period of development in\r\nand about Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThe Germantown Academy was organized January 1, 1760, and four\r\ncornerstones were laid with appropriate ceremonies, April 21, 1760.\r\n\r\nThis ancient and honorable institution was originated in a meeting held\r\nDecember 6, 1759, at the house of Daniel Mackinet, when it was resolved\r\nto start a subscription for erecting a large and commodious building\r\nnear the center of the town for the use of an English and High Dutch\r\nSchool, with suitable dwelling houses for the teachers. Christopher\r\nMeng, Christopher Sower, Baltus Reser, Daniel Machinet, John Jones, and\r\nCharles Bensell were appointed to solicit and receive subscriptions.\r\n\r\nAt the organization meeting held by the contributors, January 1, 1760,\r\nRichard Johnson was appointed treasurer, and Christopher Sower, Thomas\r\nRosse, John Jones, Daniel Mackinet, Jacob Rizer, John Bowman, Thomas\r\nLivezey, David Dreshler, George Absentz, Joseph Galloway, Charles\r\nBensell, Jacob Naglee and Benjamin Engle were chosen trustees.\r\n\r\nThe trustees purchased a lot from George Bringhurst in Bensell’s Lane,\r\nsubsequently called Schoolhouse Lane. The institution was named\r\nGermantown Union High School House.\r\n\r\nIt was also decided that the school should be free to persons of all\r\nreligious denominations.\r\n\r\nThe buildings were completed by the following year, when the school was\r\nopened in September.\r\n\r\nThe schoolhouse was eighty feet long and forty feet wide, two stories\r\nhigh, and six schoolrooms, and wings supplying two dwelling houses for\r\nthe use of the masters.\r\n\r\nThe Academy is a long-fronted building of rough gray stone topped by a\r\nquaint little belfry tower, and with small stone houses on either side,\r\nwhich balance the pleasing effect. There is a worn stone sill, which\r\ndoubtless is the same upon which Washington stepped when he visited the\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\nHilarius Becker made his appearance as the German teacher, with seventy\r\npupils, and David James Dove as the English teacher, with sixty-one\r\npupils and Thomas Pratt was the English usher.\r\n\r\nAlthough the mass of people used the German language, these numbers show\r\nthat those of the English-speaking tongue were rapidly creeping on them.\r\n\r\nDavid James Dove was one of the most famous characters in old\r\nPhiladelphia. He had formerly taught grammar sixteen years at\r\nChichester, England. He was an excellent master and his scholars made\r\nsurprising progress. He was the first English teacher in Franklin’s\r\nAcademy, and then conducted a school of his own in Vidells Alley before\r\nhe became the first English teacher in the new academy at Germantown.\r\n\r\nHe became rather overbearing and also divided too much of his time with\r\nprivate scholars, and in 1763 the trustees tried to remove him, but he\r\nrefused to be removed, even though Pelatiah Webster had already been\r\nappointed as his successor. Dove held possession of the schoolhouse and\r\ndeclared he would not retire. Finally Joseph Galloway and Thomas Wharton\r\nwere charged with the duty of dealing with Dove.\r\n\r\nOf course, Dove made way after a time for his successor, but for many\r\nyears he continued to teach a private school in Germantown.\r\n\r\nDove’s method of reclaiming truants was to send a committee of five or\r\nsix boys in search of them with a lighted lantern and a bell and in an\r\nodd equipage in broad daylight. The bell was always tinkling as they\r\nwent about the town, and soon they would bring the culprits back filled\r\nwith shame.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the academy was most satisfactory, for in 1764 Greek,\r\nLatin and the higher mathematics were taught. In the early seventies\r\nadditional ground in the rear of the lot was obtained.\r\n\r\nThe rudiments of good manners were taught along with those of learning,\r\nbut it was expressly enjoined that youths of Quaker parentage should not\r\nbe required to take off their hats in saluting the teachers.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1761, a lottery scheme was put forth to raise £1125 for the\r\nuse of this school. Another lottery the same year was for the Germantown\r\nPublic School. The academy lottery consisted of 6667 tickets at $3 to\r\nraise $3000.\r\n\r\nAs the Revolution approached, and, at last, swept over them, the school\r\nexperienced troubled times; it was difficult even to get a quorum of the\r\ntrustees.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1777, a new teacher was appointed because Thomas Dungan, the\r\nmaster of the English school, had joined the American army.\r\n\r\nAfter the Battle of Germantown the academy was used by the British as a\r\nhospital. Some twenty feet to the east of the back part of the grounds\r\nsix British soldiers, who died of their wounds, were buried in what was\r\nDreshler’s lot.\r\n\r\nAfter the war the revival was slow. In 1784 a charter was obtained\r\nincorporating it as the “Public School at Germantown,” which was amended\r\nin 1786. The school was poor, the State could not furnish much\r\nassistance and contributions were solicited. These and the increase in\r\nthe enrollment kept the Academy forging ahead. In 1808 another lottery\r\nwas held which yielded about $500, but John Bowman, the treasurer,\r\nrefused to receive the money.\r\n\r\nIn the yellow fever epidemic of 1793 the Legislature of Pennsylvania and\r\nthe Congress of the United States made proposals for an occupation. It\r\nwas given to Congress, on the rather easy terms of the restoration of\r\n“104 panes of glass, two window shutters, two door linings, three door\r\nlocks, the steps front and back both of new wood, the hearths to be laid\r\nwith new bricks, sundry patchings and white washing for which repairs\r\nand no others, the sum of $60 will be allowed out of the rent, which is\r\nto be $300 for one session.”\r\n\r\nIn the yellow fever of 1798 the use of the lower floor and cellar was\r\ngranted to the Banks of North America and Pennsylvania, they agreeing as\r\ncompensation to paint the building and to renew its roof.\r\n\r\nThe centennial anniversary of the laying of the cornerstone was\r\ncelebrated with great enthusiasm April 21, 1860, by ringing the bell,\r\nparade, 100 guns, and in the evening an address by John S. Littell and\r\nan oration by Sidney George Foster.\r\n\r\nThese are only incidents in the career of more than 160 years, and the\r\nAcademy has long been one of the most celebrated in the country.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Eccentric John Mason’s Leaning Tower on\r\n                   Blue Hill Destroyed April 22, 1864\r\n\r\n\r\nTravelers up and down both branches of the Susquehanna River years ago\r\nwill well remember the leaning tower high up on Blue Hill, opposite\r\nNorthumberland. This peculiar building hung over a precipice and viewed\r\nfrom the river level, looked as if a breath of air would topple it to\r\nthe rocks below. It was built by John Mason, who owned a farm of ninety\r\nacres of land on the hill, and who, from his eccentricities, came to be\r\nknown as the “Hermit of Blue Hill.”\r\n\r\nThe tower, which was built as an observatory, was about sixteen by\r\neighteen feet, two stories in height and of octagonal shape. It leaned\r\nat an angle of about twenty-two degrees and for safety was clamped to\r\nthe rock upon which it was built with strong iron rods. The roof was\r\nflat, and there was a railing around it for protection of those who had\r\ncourage to go upon it and look down the frightful precipice.\r\n\r\nThe view from the roof of “John Mason’s Leaning Tower,” as it was\r\ncalled, was one of superlative grandeur. Both the North and West\r\nBranches of the Susquehanna, as well as the main stream below their\r\nconfluence, the majestic hills and pretty towns of Northumberland and\r\nSunbury could all be taken in one panoramic view. Blue Hill at this\r\npoint is 301 feet in height, as determined by the engineers who laid out\r\nthe railroad in after years.\r\n\r\nThe leaning tower was built very near the spot one now sees, in seeking\r\nthe profile of old “Shikellamy,” which would be located about where the\r\ntop of the forehead would be seen. The tower was almost destroyed by\r\nvisitors who cut their initials upon everything of wood, until it was\r\nentirely covered by these characters.\r\n\r\nJohn Mason built this odd-looking house in 1839. William Henry did the\r\ncarpenter work. It stood there until the spring of 1864—a period of\r\ntwenty-five years—when, on a Sunday afternoon, April 22, it was\r\ndestroyed by a party of railroad men in a spirit of deviltry. They\r\nloosened its moorings and the curious tower rolled down the rocky\r\nprecipice with a tremendous crash and landed on a raft of logs passing\r\ndown stream.\r\n\r\nIts destruction removed one of the oddest, as well as one of the most\r\nconspicuous, landmarks along the Susquehanna River.\r\n\r\nThere are several stories related of John Mason’s eccentricities and the\r\nmotives which induced him to erect this leaning tower.\r\n\r\nAbout the time the vandals destroyed the tower a most interesting novel\r\nwas written entitled “Eros and Antiros,” which story was woven about\r\nthis scene and its unusual builder. In fact, John Mason was the hero of\r\nthe story. The author, being a personal acquaintance, may have written\r\nfrom a knowledge of the facts.\r\n\r\nIn the story John Mason had been disappointed in a love affair and\r\nsought this manner to remove himself from the busier world and to live\r\nand die in seclusion.\r\n\r\nAnother version of the eccentric John Mason’s leaning tower is that it\r\nwas his eyrie, where he gathered together a rare collection of queer old\r\nEnglish books—they sold at 75 cents the bushel-basketful at his sale—and\r\nhere he slung his hammock and here he read his books.\r\n\r\nThat story says John Mason’s father was a Quaker, living in\r\nPhiladelphia, an old acquaintance of James Jenkins, Jr., at Turtle\r\nCreek, opposite the town of Northumberland, at the base of Blue Hill,\r\nwho said to him one day, speaking of his son John, that he was a\r\nrestless fellow and wanted to go to sea, and that it would be the death\r\nof his mother. “Can’t thee take him out with thee?” Jenkins replied that\r\nit was a wild place and not likely to suit the taste of one who wanted\r\nto go sea-faring.\r\n\r\nBut John Mason did go up into the wilderness, engaged in the mercantile\r\nbusiness for a time at Northumberland, then moved his stock of\r\nmerchandise to the western side of the river and opened a store at\r\nTurtle Creek.\r\n\r\nJohn Mason never recognized or became intimate with women. One evening\r\nat the Jenkins home, Mason came in as was his custom from the store,\r\nabout 9 o’clock, and seated himself by the ample fireplace to read a\r\nbook. There was a number of young people in the room, who were playing\r\npawns and forfeits. One pretty girl was condemned in a whisper, to kiss\r\nJohn Mason. He was apparently paying no attention to the others, but, as\r\nshe slyly approached within reaching distance, he raised the tongs\r\nbetween them, saying, “Not one step nearer.”\r\n\r\nJenkins and he went alternately to Philadelphia to buy goods. Mason\r\nalways walked there and back. He lived to an extreme age and was buried\r\non his hill-top.\r\n\r\nSo much for that story. It is generally accepted that John Mason was of\r\nEnglish origin, born in Philadelphia, December 7, 1768, and died on the\r\nfarm of Colonel Meens above the present city of Williamsport, April 25,\r\n1849.\r\n\r\nDuring his life at the Blue Hill home, it is told of him that he was a\r\nsterling athlete, and could skate to Harrisburg in half a day; that he\r\noften walked to Williamsport, always carrying an old umbrella. His\r\neccentricities were much talked about in his day.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter following his death his remains were removed by\r\nfriends, on a sled and carried to the scene of his hermit life, and\r\nburied under the wide spreading branches of a chestnut tree a few yards\r\nin the rear of his leaning tower. A neat marble tombstone, properly\r\ninscribed, was erected to mark the place of his burial.\r\n\r\nThis grave has long since been so trampled upon by curious visitors,\r\nthat it was entirely obliterated many years ago. Relic hunters so\r\ndefaced the stone that it was removed to a neighboring farm house for\r\npreservation. This is all that remains by which to remember John Mason,\r\n“The Hermit of Blue Hill,” the builder of the “Leaning Tower.”\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             James Buchanan, Pennsylvania’s Only President,\r\n                          Born April 23, 1791\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Buchanan, Pennsylvania’s only President of the United States, was\r\nborn in a little settlement which bore the odd name of Stony Batter,\r\nnear Mercersburg, Franklin County, Pa., April 23, 1791.\r\n\r\nAmong the Scotch-Irish, whose enterprise brought them to America, was\r\nJames Buchanan, a native of Donegal, Ireland. He settled in Franklin\r\nCounty in 1783, where he set up a store, married Elizabeth Speer,\r\ndaughter of a farmer of Adams County, a woman of remarkable native\r\nintellect, and distinguished for her good sense and rare literary taste.\r\n\r\nMany a man has owed his success to his mother. James Buchanan said: “My\r\nmother was a remarkable woman. The daughter of a country farmer, engaged\r\nin household employment from early life until after my father’s death,\r\nshe yet found time to read much and to reflect on it. What she read once\r\nshe remembered forever. For her sons she was a delightful and\r\ninstructive companion. I attribute any distinction which I may have\r\ngained to the blessing which God conferred upon me in granting me such a\r\nmother.”\r\n\r\nAfter he was grown a man, James might often be found sitting in the\r\nkitchen to talk with his mother while she worked.\r\n\r\nIn 1798 James Buchanan, the elder, removed to Mercersburg, where his son\r\nreceived his academical education and made such progress that his\r\nparents determined to give him the benefit of a collegiate course.\r\n\r\nHe entered Dickinson College at Carlisle at the age of fourteen. Here he\r\nfound that many of the students did very much as they pleased. “To be a\r\nsober, industrious, plodding youth,” said Buchanan afterwards, “was to\r\nincur the ridicule of the mass of students.” He imitated the majority\r\nand soon learned that he was not longer desired as a student. Knowing\r\nhis father would not help him out of his plight, he turned to the pastor\r\nof his church, and by his aid James received another chance and made\r\ngood use of it. He graduated in June, 1809.\r\n\r\nIn December, following, he commenced to study law with James Hopkins, of\r\nLancaster. He applied himself, “determined” said he, “that if severe\r\napplication would make me a good lawyer, I should not fail. I studied\r\nlaw and nothing but law.” He was admitted to practice November 17, 1812,\r\nand at once took the first rank in his profession. So successful was he,\r\nthat when but forty years old he had acquired means that enabled him to\r\nretire from the profession.\r\n\r\nWhen the British burned the Capitol at Washington and threatened\r\nBaltimore, James Buchanan displayed his patriotism by enlisting as a\r\nprivate in the company commanded by Captain Henry Shipman, which marched\r\nfrom Lancaster to the defense of Baltimore and with which he served\r\nuntil honorably discharged.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1814, he was selected a representative in the Legislature,\r\nand re-elected. His intention, however, was to return to the practice of\r\nlaw and stay out of political office. A sad event changed the current of\r\nBuchanan’s life.\r\n\r\nA young woman, to whom Buchanan was engaged in early manhood, a daughter\r\nof the wealthiest family in the county, wrote him a letter of dismissal\r\nunder the spell of jealousy which had been aroused by gossips. Pride on\r\nboth sides kept the two apart until their separation was made\r\nirrevocable by her sudden death. In grief and horror, the young lover\r\nwrote to the father of the dead girl, begging the privilege of looking\r\nupon her remains and of following them to the grave. But the letter was\r\nreturned to him unopened.\r\n\r\nFour and forty years passed, and Buchanan went to his grave without ever\r\nhaving taken any other woman to his heart.\r\n\r\nTo help him forget his grief, Buchanan accepted the nomination for\r\nCongress. He did not expect to win but did, and his career thenceforward\r\nbecame political. He served five terms and at the end of his service the\r\nDemocrats of Pennsylvania brought forward his name for the vice\r\npresidency. Then President Jackson appointed him Minister to Russia. In\r\nthis position he concluded the first commercial treaty between the\r\nUnited States and Russia, securing to our seamen important privileges in\r\nthe Baltic and Black Seas.\r\n\r\nIn 1833, on his return to the United States, he was elected United\r\nStates Senator, taking his seat December 15, 1834.\r\n\r\nPresident Van Buren offered Buchanan the place of Attorney General, but\r\nit was declined. When Polk became President, the post of Secretary of\r\nState was offered and accepted. The most pressing question Buchanan had\r\nbefore him was the northern boundary of the Oregon Territory. Buchanan\r\nclosed this transaction with Great Britain in 1846, and completed our\r\nboundary line to the Pacific.\r\n\r\nAt the close of Polk’s Administration, Buchanan retired to private life\r\nat his country home, called Wheatland, just outside of Lancaster. A\r\nniece and nephew were taken into his home and raised as his own\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nWhen Pierce became President, on March 4, 1853, Buchanan was sent as\r\nUnited States Minister to England. On his return from this mission he\r\nwas nominated and elected to the presidency, and inaugurated March 4,\r\n1857.\r\n\r\nBuchanan clung to the idea that freedom rather than slavery was to blame\r\nfor all the trouble. He believed that since this Government had\r\npermitted slavery when the Union was formed, the Nation had no right to\r\ninterfere with it in States already in the Union.\r\n\r\nWhen South Carolina seceded he was within ten weeks of the end of his\r\nterm, with a hostile Congress in front of him and behind him a country\r\nas resolute as himself.\r\n\r\nBuchanan lived quietly at Wheatland and saw the Rebellion begin and\r\ntriumphantly end.\r\n\r\nWhatever the writers of history may say concerning the wisdom of\r\nBuchanan’s political ideas, no one can deny the honesty of his\r\ncharacter. No President could have been more careful to set a good\r\nexample to others. He considered that his time belonged to the Nation.\r\nWhen presented with gifts of any value, he at once returned them to the\r\nsender.\r\n\r\nIn his travels he paid his own fare, and never used a pass even when out\r\nof office. “When I cannot afford to pay my way,” he declared, “I will\r\nstay at home.”\r\n\r\nHis niece, Harriet Lane, while “Mistress of the White House,” took a\r\ntrip to West Point on a Government vessel which had been named after\r\nher. Her uncle wrote to her that national vessels should not be employed\r\non pleasure excursions, and that he would put a stop to the practice.\r\n\r\nJames Buchanan died at Wheatland, June 1, 1868.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               News of Revolution Reached Philadelphia by\r\n                       Messenger, April 24, 1775\r\n\r\n\r\nAt 5 o’clock in the afternoon of Tuesday, April 24, 1775, an express\r\nrider came galloping into Philadelphia from Trenton, with the greatest\r\npossible haste, excitement in his looks and on his lips. The rider\r\nhurried up to the City Tavern, where the people crowded in eagerness to\r\nlearn of his mission. Members of the Committee of Correspondence were in\r\nthe crowd and to these the rider delivered his dispatch. It was a brief\r\nand hurried message, but it had come a long route and it was big with\r\nthe fate of a nation.\r\n\r\nIt was a dispatch from Watertown, dated April 19, announcing that\r\nGeneral Gage’s men had marched out of Boston the night before, crossed\r\nto Cambridge, fired on and killed the militia at Lexington, destroyed a\r\nstore at Concord, were now on the retreat and hotly pursued. Many were\r\nkilled on both sides and the country was rising.\r\n\r\nThe message had come by way of Worchester, where it was vised by the\r\ntown clerk. It then went to Brookline, Thursday, 20th, and was forwarded\r\nat 4 o’clock in the afternoon from Norwich; at 7 that evening it was\r\nexpressed from New London.\r\n\r\nThe committee at Lynn received, copied and started the rider with it at\r\n1 o’clock Friday morning. It came to Saybrook before sun-up. At\r\nbreakfast time another messenger took it up to Killingworth. At 8\r\no’clock it was at East Guilford; at 10 in Guilford, and at noon in\r\nBrandford. It was sent from New Haven with further details on Saturday,\r\nand dispatched from the New York committee rooms 4 o’clock Sunday\r\nafternoon. It reached New Brunswick at 2 o’clock Monday morning,\r\nPrinceton at 6 o’clock in the evening and Trenton at 9 o’clock Tuesday\r\nmorning. It was indorsed: “Rec’d the above p. express and forwarded the\r\nsame to the Committee of Philadelphia.”\r\n\r\nThus was the news of the actual opening battle of the Revolution carried\r\nby express riders from Watertown to Philadelphia, which had been\r\nselected as the seat of Government for the Thirteen Colonies.\r\n\r\nTwo days later another express came into Philadelphia bringing fuller\r\nparticulars of “the Battle of Lexington,” as that memorable fight has\r\nsince been called.\r\n\r\nThe news of Lexington arrived too late in the day to spread at once over\r\nthe city. But next morning every man, woman and child knew it, and,\r\nborne by intense patriotic feeling the people assembled in public\r\nmeeting, as if by common consent at the State House.\r\n\r\nThere were 8000 persons present, and all seemed to be actuated with but\r\na single purpose. The Committee of Correspondence took charge of the\r\nmeeting and its authority was recognized and accepted.\r\n\r\nOnly one resolution was proposed and adopted, to “associate together, to\r\ndefend with arms their property, liberty and lives against all attempts\r\nto deprive them of it,” and then, with impatience and eagerness, to\r\naction. The time for words was passed. The time for organization,\r\narming, drilling and marching had come.\r\n\r\nThe enrollment began at this meeting. The committee besought all who had\r\narms to let them know, so that they might be purchased and secured. The\r\nassociates availed themselves of their existing organization to turn\r\nthemselves forthwith into military companies.\r\n\r\nIt was agreed that two troops of light horse, two companies of riflemen\r\nand two companies of artillery, with brass and iron field pieces, should\r\nbe formed immediately.\r\n\r\nDrilling was started at once, and the progress was so marked that the\r\ncompanies were ready to parade by May 10, when they turned out to\r\nreceive Continental Congress, and also to honor John Hancock.\r\n\r\nThe foot company and riflemen turned out to meet the Southern delegates\r\nto Congress at Gray’s Ferry. The officers of all the companies mounted,\r\nwent out to meet the Eastern delegates and Hancock.\r\n\r\nThe associators’ organization was officered as follows: First Battalion,\r\nJohn Dickinson, colonel; John Chevalier, lieutenant colonel; Jacob\r\nMorgan and William Coates, majors. Second Battalion, Daniel Roderdeau,\r\ncolonel; Joseph Reed, lieutenant colonel; John Cox and John Bayard,\r\nmajors. Third Battalion, John Cadwallader, colonel; John Nixon,\r\nlieutenant colonel; Thomas Mifflin and Samuel Merideth, majors.\r\n\r\nPeter Markoe was captain of the light horse, Joseph Cowperthwait of the\r\nQuaker Blues, James Biddle, Benjamin Loxley, Thomas Proctor and Joseph\r\nMoulder, were officers of the artillery, and Richard Peters, Tench\r\nFrancis, William Bradford and Lambert Cadwallader were in command of the\r\nGreens. John Shee, John Wilcocks, Thomas Willing, Francis Gurney and\r\nothers were of the staff.\r\n\r\nThe battalions, mustering 1500 men, all uniformed and equipped, and 500\r\nartillerymen and troops of horse, gave a drill early in June in the\r\npresence of the “honorable members of the Continental Congress and\r\nseveral thousand spectators.”\r\n\r\nThe troops were reviewed by General Washington on June 20 and next day\r\nhe set out for Boston escorted across New Jersey by the cavalry troop.\r\n\r\nOn June 23, the associators listened to an eloquent sermon by the\r\nReverend Dr. William Smith.\r\n\r\nThey petitioned the Assembly, setting forth a full and detailed account\r\nof their organization into companies, etc., and asked that they be put\r\ninto service at once. Neither the Governor nor the Council had the power\r\nor funds to comply, and even the Congress had no direct authority as yet\r\nto raise an army.\r\n\r\nFranklin had returned from England May 5, and the next morning he was\r\nelected to Congress. But his work on the Committee of Safety is really\r\nthe history of the defense of Philadelphia during the first year of the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nIt was late in June before the Committee of Safety was given power to\r\nemploy the associators, and the city and counties were called upon to\r\nprovide arms and equipment, the House agreeing to pay for the service of\r\nthe troops.\r\n\r\nA committee was named whose duty it was to call troops into the service\r\nas necessity demanded and to provide for the defense of this Province\r\nagainst insurrections and invasion.\r\n\r\nThe Committee of Safety met July 3. Franklin was unanimously chosen\r\npresident, and William Govett, clerk. It proceeded to business with\r\nenergy and dispatch.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Frame of Government Written by William\r\n                          Penn, April 25, 1682\r\n\r\n\r\nPenn’s remarkable frame of Government, dated April 25, 1682, was so far\r\nin advance of the age that, as Bancroft says, “its essential principles\r\nremain to this day without change.” Another competent critic has said\r\nthat in it was “the germ if not the development of every valuable\r\nimprovement in Government or legislation which has been introduced into\r\nthe political systems of more modern epochs.”\r\n\r\nThe government was to consist of the Governor, a Provincial Council, and\r\na General Assembly. These bodies, which were to make laws, create\r\ncourts, choose officers and transact public affairs, were to be elected\r\nby the freemen by ballot. By freemen, were meant not only handholders,\r\nbut “every inhabitant, artificer, or other resident that pays scot or\r\nlot to the Government.” Penn believed that “any government is free to\r\nthe people under it, whatever be the frame, where the laws rule and the\r\npeople are a party to those laws, and more than this is tyranny,\r\noligarchy or confusion.”\r\n\r\nThe “Frame of Government” and the “Laws Agreed Upon in England” were the\r\nfinal products of all Penn’s best thinking and conferences, and were\r\nbrought with him to the Colony. Though changed in form many times, they\r\nshaped all future Constitutions of Pennsylvania, of other States and\r\neven the Federal Union.\r\n\r\nThis frame was published by Penn, together with certain laws agreed on\r\nbetween himself and the purchasers under him, entitled “The Frame of the\r\nGovernment of the Province of Pennsylvania, in America; together with\r\ncertain laws, agreed upon in England by the Governor and divers of the\r\nFree Men of the aforesaid Province. To be further Explained and\r\nConfirmed there, by the First Provincial Council and General Assembly\r\nthat shall be held, if they seem meet.”\r\n\r\nJames Claypoole called it in one of his letters, “the fundamentals for\r\ngovernment.” In effect it was the first Constitution of Pennsylvania. It\r\nwas the work of William Penn and reflects precisely some of the\r\nbrightest and some of the much less bright traits of his genius and\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThe “preface” or preamble to this Constitution is curious, for it is\r\nwritten as if Penn felt that the eyes of the court were upon him. The\r\nfirst two paragraphs form a simple excursus upon the doctrine of the law\r\nand the transgressor as expounded in St. Paul’s Epistle to the Romans:\r\n“For we know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold under the\r\nsin,” etc. From this Penn derives “the divine right of government,” the\r\nobject of government being two-fold, to terrify evildoers and to cherish\r\nthose who do well “which gives government a life beyond corruption (i.\r\ne., divine right), and makes it as durable in the world as good men\r\nshould be.” Hence Penn thought that government seemed like a part of\r\nreligion itself, a thing sacred in its institution and end.\r\n\r\n“They weakly err,” continues Penn, “that think there is no other use of\r\ngovernment than correction; which is the coarsest part of it. * * * Men\r\nside with their passions against their reason, and their sinister\r\ninterests have so strong a bias upon their minds that they lean to them\r\nagainst the good of the things they know.”\r\n\r\nThe form, he concludes, does not matter much after all, “Any government\r\nis free to the people under it (whatever be the frame) where the laws\r\nrule and the people are a party to these laws.” Good men are to be\r\npreferred even above good laws. The frame of laws now published, Penn\r\nadds, “has been carefully contrived to secure the people from abuse of\r\npower.”\r\n\r\nIn the Constitution which follows the preamble, Penn begins by\r\nconfirming to the freemen of the province all the liberties, franchises\r\nand properties secured to them by the patent of King Charles II.\r\n\r\nAfter stating how the government was to be organized, he directed that\r\nthe council of seventy-two members, was to be elected at once, one-third\r\nof the members to go out, and their successors elected each year, and\r\nafter the first seven years those going out each year shall not be\r\nreturned within a year. Two-thirds of the members constituted a quorum\r\non all important matters, but twenty-four would suffice on minor\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nThe Governor was to preside and to have three votes. All bills should be\r\nprepared and proposed by the Council for presentation to the General\r\nAssembly, which body, on the ninth day should pass or defeat such\r\nmeasures as presented.\r\n\r\nTo be sure the Provincial Council also was an elective body, but the\r\ndifference was in the fact that it was meant to consist of the\r\nGovernor’s friends; it was an aristocratic body, and therefore not\r\nentirely representative.\r\n\r\nAside from this fatal defect there is much to praise in Penn’s\r\nConstitution and something to wonder at, as being so far in advance of\r\nhis age.\r\n\r\nBesides carefully defining and limiting the executive functions of the\r\nGovernor and Council a wholesome and liberal provision was made for\r\neducation, public schools, inventions and useful scientific discoveries.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution could not be altered without the consent of the\r\nGovernor and six-sevenths of the Council and the General Assembly, which\r\nrule, if enforced, would have perpetuated any Constitution, however bad.\r\n\r\nOn May 15, 1682, Penn’s code of laws, passed in England, to be altered\r\nor amended in Pennsylvania, was promulgated. It consisted of forty\r\nstatutes, the first of which declared the character or Constitution,\r\nwhich has just been analyzed to be “fundamental in the Government\r\nitself.”\r\n\r\nRegulations as to taxes, trials, prisons and marriage were clearly set\r\nforth in the code. It was also arranged that every child of twelve\r\nshould be taught some useful trade. Members of the Council and General\r\nAssembly, as well as Judges, were to be professing Christians. Every one\r\nwas to be allowed to worship God according to the dictates of his own\r\nconscience and this not as a mere matter of toleration, but because it\r\nwas an inherent right.\r\n\r\nThe penalty of death was to be inflicted sparingly; some 200 offenses\r\nwhich were named as capital by English law were to be punished in a\r\nlighter manner.\r\n\r\nDuring Penn’s absence there was clashing, dissension and tumult. If he\r\ncould have kept his hand in person on the Government for a generation\r\nthere would have been a wonderful difference in the results attained.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             Indians Captured James McKnight, Assemblyman,\r\n                             April 26, 1779\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1779 conditions along the frontier became more serious\r\nthan in any time past. The Indians were more active and destroyed\r\ngrowing crops and burned the homes and outbuildings of the settlers,\r\nwhom they murdered or took away in captivity.\r\n\r\nThe condition was so alarming it was reported to the Supreme Executive\r\nCouncil. One such letter, dated “Fort Augusta 27th April, 1779” written\r\nby Colonel Samuel Hunter, was in part: “I am really sorry to inform you\r\nof our present Disturbances; not a day, but there is some of the Enemy\r\nmakes their appearances on our Frontiers. On Sunday last, there was a\r\nparty of Savages attact’d the inhabitants that lived near Fort Jenkins,\r\nand had taken two or three familys prisoners, but the Garrison being\r\nappris’d of it, about thirty men turned out of the Fort and Rescued the\r\nPrisoners; the Indians collecting Themselves in a body drove our men\r\nunder Cover of the Fort, with the loss of three men kill’d & four Badly\r\nWounded; they burned several houses near the Fort, kill’d cattle, &\r\ndrove off a number of Horses.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday there was another party of Indians, about thirty or forty,\r\nkill’d and took seven of our militia, that was stationed at a little\r\nFort near Muncy Hill, call’d Fort Freeland; there was two or three of\r\nthe inhabitants taken prisoners; among the latter is James McKnight,\r\nEsqr., one of our Assemblymen; the same day a party of thirteen of the\r\ninhabitants that went to hunt their Horses, about four or five miles\r\nfrom Fort Muncy was fired upon by a large party of Indians, and all\r\ntaken or kill’d except one man. Captain Walker, of the Continental\r\nTroops, who commands at that post turned out with thirty-four men to the\r\nplace he heard the firing, and found four men kill’d and scalped and\r\nsupposes they Captured ye Remaind’r.\r\n\r\n“This is the way our Frontiers is harrassed by a cruel Savage Enemy, so\r\nthat they cannot get any Spring crops in to induce them to stay in the\r\nCounty. I am afraid in a very short time we shall have no inhabitants\r\nabove this place unless when General Hand arrives here he may order some\r\nof the Troops at Wyoming down on our Frontiers, all Col. Hartley’s\r\nRegiment, our two month’s men, and what militia we can turn out, is very\r\ninadequate to guard our Country.\r\n\r\n“I am certain everything is doing for our relief but afraid it will be\r\ntoo late for this County, as its impossible to prevail on the\r\ninhabitants to make a stand, upon account of their Women and Childer.\r\n\r\n“Our case is Really deplorable and alarming, and our County on ye Eve of\r\nbreaking up, as I am informed at the time I am writing this by two or\r\nthree expresses that there is nothing to be seen but Desolation, fire &\r\nsmoke, as the inhabitants is collected at particular places, the Enemy\r\nburns all their Houses that they have evacuated.” The bearer of this\r\nimportant letter was James Hepburn.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of interest that the James McKnight captured at Fort\r\nFreeland had secured 300 acres of land, April 3, 1769, in what is now\r\nUnion County, where he brought his family. In 1774 they purchased three\r\ntracts of land “contiguous to and bounded on each other,” on Limestone\r\nRun, in Turbut Township, Northumberland County.\r\n\r\nIn 1776 William McKnight was chosen a member of the Committee of Safety,\r\nand was a most zealous and active patriot.\r\n\r\nBoth he and his wife perished at the hands of the Indians, when they\r\nattempted to make a trip from Fort Freeland, where they had sought\r\nrefuge from the savages. Their only son, James, carried their bodies\r\nfrom Fort Freeland to the graveyard now known as Chillisquaque, and\r\nthere buried them himself.\r\n\r\nJames McKnight had three sisters. He married Elizabeth Gillen, and was\r\nregarded as a man of great courage and rectitude. In 1778 he was elected\r\nto the General Assembly, but did not long survive to enjoy the honor.\r\n\r\nThe McKnight family had frequent and terrible experiences with the\r\nIndians. In the autumn of 1778 Mrs. James McKnight and Mrs. Margaret\r\nWilson Durham, each with an infant in her arms, started on horseback\r\nfrom Fort Freeland to go to Northumberland. Near the mouth of Warrior\r\nRun, about two miles from the fort, they were fired upon by a band of\r\nIndians, lying in ambush. Mrs. Durham’s child was killed in her arms,\r\nand she fell from her horse. An Indian rushed out of the bushes, scalped\r\nher and fled.\r\n\r\nAlexander Guffy and two companions named Peter and Ellis Williams rushed\r\nto the scene of the shooting and when they approached Mrs. Durham, whom\r\nthey supposed dead, they were greatly surprised to see her rise up and\r\npiteously call for water. With the loss of her scalp she presented a\r\nhorrible appearance. Guffy ran to the river and brought water in his\r\nhat. They then bound up her head, as best they could, and placed her in\r\na canoe and hastily paddled down stream fifteen miles to Sunbury, where\r\nColonel William Plunket, also a distinguished physician, dressed her\r\nwounded head, and she recovered. She died in 1829, aged seventy-four\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nMrs. McKnight escaped unhurt from the surprise attack. The shots\r\nfrightened the horse she was riding, it turned and ran back to the fort.\r\nMrs. McKnight came near losing her child, when the horse wheeled and the\r\nchild fell from her arms, but she caught it by the foot and held to it\r\nuntil the fort was reached.\r\n\r\nTwo sons of Mrs. McKnight, who were accompanying the party on foot,\r\nattempted to escape by hiding under the bank of the river, but were\r\ntaken by the Indians.\r\n\r\nJames Durham, husband of Margaret, was taken at the same time. The three\r\nprisoners survived their captivity in Canada, and returned to their\r\nhomes at the close of the Revolution in 1783.\r\n\r\nOn the eventful day that the little stockade was next attacked, April\r\n26, 1779, Hon. James McKnight, was captured by the Indians.\r\n\r\nWilliam McKnight and his wife and James and his wife are interred in the\r\nold Chillisquaque burying ground.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Steam Boat Susquehanna, in Effort to\r\n                   Navigate River, Starts Fatal Trip,\r\n                             April 27, 1826\r\n\r\n\r\nEven before the advent of canals or railroads the enterprising merchants\r\nof Baltimore sensed the importance of facilitating the commerce along\r\nthe great Susquehanna River.\r\n\r\nThey believed it would materially enhance their volume of business,\r\nespecially in lumber, iron, grain, and whiskey, if the river would be\r\nfreed of such obstructions as impeded or hindered navigation.\r\n\r\nLarge sums of money were expended in removing rocky channels in the\r\nriver below Columbia, so as to admit the passage of arks and rafts down\r\nstream, on their way to tide water. A canal had been constructed from\r\nPort Deposit, northward, in order that the returning craft might avoid\r\nthe shoals and dangerous reefs along the first ten miles above tide\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nYet in spite of all these improvements no satisfactory way had been\r\nfound which would return to the producers of the Susquehanna Valley such\r\narticles of commerce and merchandise as they would naturally require in\r\nreturn for the raw products of the forest, field and mine.\r\n\r\nThe authorities of Pennsylvania were also awake to the situation, as\r\nwere the citizens. Several attempts had been made to have complete\r\nsurveys of the river and estimates of the cost of the work required to\r\nmake the great river navigable.\r\n\r\nTo Baltimore, more than to Pennsylvania, belongs the credit of an actual\r\nattempt to establish steamboat navigation.\r\n\r\nIn 1825 a small steamboat, named the Susquehanna, was built in Baltimore\r\nand, when launched, was towed up to Port Deposit.\r\n\r\nThe Harrisburg Chronicle said:\r\n\r\n“The Susquehanna was expected at Columbia on Sunday night, Tuesday’s\r\nreports were, that she had not got to Columbia. Eye-witnesses to her\r\nprogress put the matter to rest on Wednesday; they had seen her a short\r\ndistance above the head of the Maryland Canal, with a posse of men\r\ntugging at the ropes, and when they had tugged nine miles gave up the\r\njob. So ended all the romance about the Susquehanna. She drew too much\r\nwater (22 inches) for the purpose and started at the wrong point.\r\nWatermen say that the crookedness of the channel, with the rapidity of\r\nthe current, makes it utterly impossible for a steamboat to ascend the\r\nfalls between the head of the canal and Columbia.”\r\n\r\nThe Chronicle article says further: “We have a report that Mr.\r\nWinchester, of Baltimore, has contracted for the building of a steamboat\r\nat York Haven. We also learn that the York Company are making great\r\nprogress with the sheet-iron steamboat, and that she will be launched\r\nabout the 4th of July.”\r\n\r\nThis sheetiron boat was called the Codorus, and early in April of the\r\nnext year ascended the river as far as Binghamton, after which she\r\nreturned to York Haven. Her captain, a Mr. Elger, reported that\r\nnavigation of the Susquehanna by steam was impracticable.\r\n\r\nEither the original Susquehanna renamed or another steamboat built by\r\nthe Baltimore promoters, and named Susquehanna and Baltimore was put on\r\nthe river and operation above Conewago Falls by Captain Cornwell, an\r\nexperienced river pilot.\r\n\r\nShe was accompanied on her trial trip on this portion of the river by a\r\nboard of Commissioners of the State of Maryland, Messrs. Patterson,\r\nEllicott and Morris, three distinguished citizens of Baltimore. Capt.\r\nCornwell had already in March made several successful trips as far up as\r\nNorthumberland and Danville on the North Branch and to Milton on the\r\nWest Branch, returning to York Haven without accident.\r\n\r\nApril 17, 1826, the boat started from York Haven, having in tow a large\r\nkeel boat capable of carrying a thousand bushels of wheat, and proceeded\r\non her fatal trip, arriving at the Nescopeck Falls at 4 o’clock on May\r\n3. At these falls there was an outer and an artificial inner channel of\r\nshallow water for the accommodation of rafts and arks. Capt. Cornwell\r\ndecided after consulting with other river men on board, to try first the\r\nmain, or deep water channel, and the captain argued that if the boat\r\nwould not stem it, that he could then drop back and try the other one.\r\nThe boat made a halt in a small eddy below the falls on the east side of\r\nthe river and some of the passengers went ashore; this was the case with\r\nthe Maryland Commissioners.\r\n\r\nThe boat was directed into the main channel, and had proceeded perhaps\r\ntwo-thirds of the distance through the falls, when she ceased to make\r\nfurther progress, the engine was stopped and she was permitted to drift\r\nback to the foot of the rapid, where she struck upon a wall dividing the\r\nartificial from the main channel, and at that instant one of her boilers\r\nexploded.\r\n\r\nThe scene was as awful as the imagination can picture. Two of the\r\npassengers on board, named John Turk and Heber Whitmarsh, raftmen from\r\nChenango, N.Y., were instantly killed; William Camp, a merchant from\r\nOwego, was fatally scalded by escaping steam. Dave Rose, of Chenango, N.\r\nY., was fatally injured. Quincy Maynard, the engineer, as stated in the\r\naccount published in the Danville Watchman, one week after the\r\noccurrence, was not expected to recover. Christian Brobst, of Catawissa\r\nand Jeremiah Miller, of Juniata, were seriously injured. Messrs.\r\nWoodside, Colt and Underwood, of Danville, were more or less injured, as\r\nwere Messrs. Barton, Hurley, Foster and Colonel Paxton, of Catawissa,\r\nand Benjamin Edwards, of Braintrim, Luzerne County.\r\n\r\nIt was said by somebody on board that at the time of the explosion, a\r\npassenger was holding down the lever of the safety valve, but why this\r\nshould be done after the boat had ceased her efforts to pull through is\r\ndifficult to conjecture. Thus ended the second attempt to navigate the\r\nSusquehanna by steam power.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Shawnee Indians Murder Conestoga Tribesmen\r\n                             April 28, 1728\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo Shawnee Indians cruelly murdered a man and a woman of the Conestoga\r\ntribe, April 28, 1728. John Wright, of Hempfield, wrote from Lancaster,\r\nMay 2, advising James Logan of this murder, and that the Conestoga have\r\ndemanded of the Shawnee the surrender of the murderers. He further wrote\r\nthat some Shawnee had brought the Shawnee murderers as far as Peter\r\nChartier’s house, but there the party engaged in a drinking bout and\r\nthrough the connivance of Chartier the two murderers escaped.\r\n\r\nChartier was an Indian trader among the Shawnee and was himself a\r\nhalf-blood Shawnee. He had traded for a time on the Pequea Creek and at\r\nPaxtang. Later he settled at the Shawnee town on the west side of the\r\nSusquehanna, at the mouth of the Yellow Breeches Creek, the present site\r\nof New Cumberland. He later removed on the Conemaugh, then to the\r\nAllegheny, about 1734.\r\n\r\nThe action upon the part of Chartier incensed the Conestoga so much that\r\nthey threatened to wipe out the whole section of the Shawnee.\r\n\r\nJohn Wright further states in his letter, “Yesterday there came\r\nseventeen or eighteen of the young men, commanded by Tilehausey, all\r\nConestoga Indians, painted for war, all armed. We inquired which way\r\nthey were going. They would not tell us, but said they or some of them\r\nwere going to war, and that there were some Canoy to go along with them.\r\nBut we hearing the above report, are apt to think that they are going\r\nagainst the Shawnee.”\r\n\r\nAlmost contemporary with this murder, the whites along the Schuylkill\r\nhad their safety threatened from another quarter. Kakowwatchy, head of\r\nthe Shawnee at Pechoquealon, claimed to have heard that the Flatheads,\r\nor Catawba from Carolina, had entered Pennsylvania to strike the Indians\r\nalong the Susquehanna. He sent eleven warriors to ascertain the truth of\r\nthis incursion of the Southern Indians, and as they approached the\r\nneighborhood of the Durham Iron Works, at Manatawny, their provisions\r\nfailing, forced the inhabitants to give them victuals and drink.\r\n\r\nThe people did not know these Indians and believing the chief of the\r\nband to be a Spanish Indian, caused great alarm.\r\n\r\nFamilies left their plantations, and the women and children were in\r\ngreat danger from exposure, as the weather was cold. About twenty white\r\nmen took arms, approached the band, and soon a battle was in progress.\r\nThe whites said that the Indians refused a parley and fired first,\r\nwounding several of the inhabitants. The red men made off into the woods\r\nand were not seen again. Their leader was wounded, but escaped.\r\n\r\nThe identity of this band was not known until ten days later, May 20,\r\nwhen the Lieutenant Governor Patrick Gordon was waited upon by John\r\nSmith and Nicholas Schonhoven, two Indian traders from Pechoquealon, who\r\ndelivered to him a verbal message from Kakowwatchy, which was an\r\nexplanation of the unfortunate affair, and for which the chief sent his\r\nregrets, and asked the Governor for a return of the gun which the\r\nwounded leader had lost.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant Governor, accompanied by many other citizens of\r\nPhiladelphia went to the troubled district, and personally pleaded with\r\nthose who had fled from their plantations to return. So excited were the\r\nwhites that they seemed ready to kill any red man or woman.\r\n\r\nOn May 20, an Indian man, two women and two girls, appeared at John\r\nRoberts, at Cucussea, then in Chester County. Their neighbors fearing\r\ndanger, rallied to their defense, and shot the man and one of the women,\r\nbeat out the brains of the other woman, and wounded the girls. Their\r\nexcuse was that the Indian had put an arrow into his bow.\r\n\r\nThe Provincial authorities were fearful that revenge upon the people\r\nmight be attempted, so the two neighbors who committed the atrocity were\r\narrested and sent to Chester for trial, and notice of the affair was\r\nsent to Sassoonan, Opekasset, and Manawhyhickon, with a request that\r\nthey bring their people to a treaty, arranged to be held at Conestoga\r\nwith Chief Civility and the Indians there.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania Government did not leave all to diplomacy. John\r\nPawling, Marcus Hulings and Mordecai Lincoln (a relative of President\r\nAbraham Lincoln) were commissioned to gather the inhabitants and to put\r\nthem in a posture to defend themselves.\r\n\r\nHaving forwarded to Kakowwatchy the watchcoats, belts and tomahawks\r\ndropped by the eleven warriors, and having sent a present, together with\r\na request that he warn his Indians to be more cautious in the future,\r\nGovernor Gordon expressed a wish to see Kakowwatchy at Durham, then went\r\nto Conestoga, and met Civility, Tawenne and other Conestoga, some\r\nDelaware and three Shawnee chiefs.\r\n\r\nGordon began by reminding the Indians of the links in the chain of\r\nfriendship and that neither the Indians nor Christians would believe ill\r\nreports of each other without investigation of the facts. The Governor\r\nthen made them presents of watchcoats, duffels, blankets, shirts,\r\ngunpowder, lead, flints and knives.\r\n\r\nThe Governor then told them of the recent murders, and of the intention\r\nto punish those who killed the Indians, if found guilty. The chiefs, in\r\nturn, declared that they had no cause of complaint.\r\n\r\nSassoonan, or Allummapees, the head of the Delaware, and his nephew,\r\nOpekasset, and some other chiefs, including the great Shikellamy,\r\nvicegerent of the Six Nations, met with Governor Gordon at Molatton, and\r\nfrom there went to Philadelphia, where a great council was held June 4,\r\n1728, which was concluded most satisfactorily for all concerned.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Christian Post, Moravian Missionary and\r\n                     Messenger, Died April 29, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nChristian Frederic Post, who has been denominated “the great Moravian\r\npeace-maker,” was a simple uneducated missionary of the Moravian Church.\r\nHe was born in Polish Prussia, in 1710, and at an early age came under\r\nthe influence of the Moravians. He emigrated to this country as a member\r\nof the “Sea Congregation,” which arrived on the Catherine, at New\r\nLondon, Conn., May 30, 1742. Post, with the other members, joined the\r\ncongregation at Bethlehem, Pa., three weeks later.\r\n\r\nFrom that time until his death, at Germantown, April 29, 1785, he\r\nperformed many hazardous missions for his church and the Provincial\r\nGovernment of Pennsylvania, and many times was in imminent peril. The\r\nfirst several years of his residence in Pennsylvania he was employed as\r\na Moravian missionary, but afterwards was almost constantly performing\r\nimportant services for the Province in its Indian dealings.\r\n\r\nSome of the journals of Post, which appear in the Archives of\r\nPennsylvania, and have been republished elsewhere, are valuable for the\r\nintimate history of the peoples and the country through which he\r\ntraveled. One of the editors who republished his journals, wrote as\r\nfollows concerning the missionary and mediator: “Antiquarians and\r\nhistorians have alike admired the sublime courage of the man and the\r\nheroic patriotism which made him capable of advancing into the heart of\r\na hostile territory, into the very hands of a cruel and treacherous foe.\r\nBut aside from Post’s supreme religious faith, he had a shrewd knowledge\r\nof Indian customs, and knew that in the character of an ambassador\r\nrequested by the Western tribes his mission would be a source of\r\nprotection. Therefore, even under the very walls of Fort Dusquesne, he\r\ntrusted not in vain to Indian good faith.”\r\n\r\nWhen Conrad Weiser visited Shikellamy at Shamokin, May, 1743, he wrote:\r\n“As I saw their old men seated on rude benches and on the ground\r\nlistening with decorous gravity and rapt attention to Post, I fancied I\r\nsaw before me a congregation of primitive Christians.”\r\n\r\nIn 1743 Post was married to a converted Indian woman, and endeared\r\nhimself to all the Indians. But all was not smooth, for the Brethren\r\nwere persecuted and humbled before their converts. Post, who had been on\r\na journey to the Iroquois country, in March, 1745, was arrested at\r\nCanajoharie and sent to New York, where he was imprisoned for weeks, on\r\na trumped-up charge of abetting Indian raids. He was released April 10.\r\n\r\nIn 1758 it became a matter of importance with Governor Denny and Sir\r\nWilliam Johnson, that a treaty of peace be secured with the Western\r\nIndians. Post was selected to convey to them the white belt of peace and\r\nreconciliation. Tedyuskung, the Delaware king, protested against his\r\ngoing, declaring he would never return alive, but the bold and confident\r\nChristian said it was a mission of peace, that God would protect him,\r\nand that he must go.\r\n\r\nOn July 15, 1758, Post departed from Philadelphia with five Indian\r\nguides. He carried with him copies of the treaties made with Tedyuskung,\r\nbelts of wampum and messages from the Governor. He made his trip by way\r\nof Bethlehem, Shamokin, Great Island, Chinclamoose, etc.\r\n\r\nIt was a perilous journey. Twice he got lost in the woods, and one of\r\nhis guides strayed away and could not be found. Without food and\r\ndrenched with rain, night after night he slept on the cold, wet ground.\r\nHe was frequently very near the French. Finally he arrived at King\r\nBeaver’s, who ruled over the Delaware in the West. These Indians\r\nremembered him when he preached the gospel at Wyoming, and were glad to\r\nsee him. They gave him a public dinner, to which they invited the\r\nsurrounding tribes.\r\n\r\nThe French sent spies to watch him and to induce him to go to Fort\r\nDuquesne. Post refused to be trapped, but instead succeeded in making\r\narrangements for kindling a great council-fire at Easton in October\r\nfollowing.\r\n\r\nPost now set out on his return and had not proceeded far when he heard\r\nthe thunder of nineteen cannon discharged at the fort. Under the very\r\nmouths of these guns he had, singly and alone, with the full knowledge\r\nof the French, laid a plan which rent asunder the alliance between them\r\nand their Indian allies.\r\n\r\nPost succeeded in his mission, and the French at the fort, finding\r\nthemselves abandoned by their allies, fired it and fled, as the invalid\r\ngeneral, John Forbes, and his army made their appearance.\r\n\r\nFrank Cowan, poet of Southwestern Pennsylvania, tells the story in one\r\nof his songs, of which the following is a verse:\r\n\r\n                “The Head of Iron from his couch,\r\n                  Gave courage and command,\r\n                Which Washington, Bouquet and Grant\r\n                  Repeated to the band;\r\n                Till Hark! the Highlanders began\r\n                  With their chieftain’s word to swell,\r\n                ‘Tonight, I shall sup and drain my cup\r\n                  In Fort Du Quense—or Hell!’\r\n                But the Man of Prayer, and not of boast,\r\n                  Had spoken first, in Frederic Post.”\r\n\r\nAgain, in 1761, he proceeded to the Muskingum and built the first white\r\nman’s house within the present State of Ohio. He had made previous trips\r\ninto this country, and always succeeded in persuading the Shawnee and\r\nDelaware to “bury the hatchet” and desert the French. He did this with a\r\nheavy reward upon his scalp, and while his every footstep was surrounded\r\nwith danger.\r\n\r\nIn 1762 the Reverend John G. B. Heckewelder, the Moravian missionary and\r\nwriter, especially among the Delaware, was an assistant to Post.\r\n\r\nToward the close of his eventful life Post retired from the Moravian\r\nsect and entered the Protestant Episcopal Church. He died at Germantown\r\non April 29, 1785, and on May 1 his remains were interred in the “Lower\r\ngraveyard of that place, the Reverend William White, then rector of\r\nChrist Church,” conducting the funeral service.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Veterans of French and Indian Wars\r\n                        Organize April 30, 1765\r\n\r\n\r\nAs early as 1764 officers of the First and Second Battalions of\r\nPennsylvania who had served under Colonel Henry Bouquet during the\r\nFrench and Indian War tarried at Bedford on their way home and formed an\r\nassociation. The purpose of this organization was that they be awarded\r\nthe land to which they were entitled for service rendered.\r\n\r\nThis association held another and more important meeting at Carlisle,\r\nApril 30, 1765, when they elected officers and renewed their application\r\nto the proprietaries and asked for 24,000 acres of land along the West\r\nBranch of the Susquehanna.\r\n\r\nIn this formal application they stated their object was “to embody\r\nthemselves on some good land at some distance from the inhabited part of\r\nthe Province, where by their industry they might procure a comfortable\r\nsubsistance for themselves and by their arms, union and increase become\r\na powerful barrier to the Province.”\r\n\r\nThese officers knew that the Proprietaries had not that much land to\r\naward them and that they had not yet purchased the West Branch lands\r\nfrom the Indians, but at this meeting they adopted a strong resolution\r\ncalling upon them to make such a purchase.\r\n\r\nFollowing the French and Indian War the lawless white men had been\r\nencroaching upon Indian lands, provoked hostilities and murdered many\r\ninnocent Indians. The situation became so acute that General Gage\r\noffered troops to assist Governor Penn in removing and punishing these\r\nintruders.\r\n\r\nGovernor Penn appealed to the Assembly for help. In the discussion of\r\nthis important matter it was learned from George Croghan, Sir William\r\nJohnson and others that the Indians designed a northern confederacy, and\r\nwere determined to avenge this intrusion and the murder of the Conestoga\r\nIndians at Lancaster.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly agreed to pass a boundary bill. They also sent a message to\r\nthe Indians promising to punish those responsible for the Conestoga\r\nmassacre, and urged a conference at which a boundary line could be\r\nestablished. They also appropriated £3000 as a present to appease the\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nDuring the following spring several conferences were held, the largest\r\nbeing at Fort Pitt, where many chiefs and warriors of the Six Nations\r\nwere present; in all 1103 men, women and children. The explanations were\r\nsatisfactory and the presents and cash joyously received.\r\n\r\nBut it is quite probable that another savage war was averted by the\r\nintervention of Sir William Johnson, who, at this critical period,\r\nsuggested a great council be held at Fort Stanwix, where this vital\r\nquestion could be definitely decided. This council was held in October,\r\n1768, with Governor Penn present in person, as well as the principal\r\nchiefs of the tribes which had grievances to air.\r\n\r\nThe council, in the treaty of November 5, 1768, settled the boundary\r\ndispute and the Indians sold to the Proprietaries of Pennsylvania most\r\nof the central and western end of the State, excepting a small strip\r\nalong Lake Erie. The consideration was $10,000.\r\n\r\nNow that the Proprietaries had purchased the land desired by the\r\nassociation, on February 3, 1769, it was ordered by the Board of\r\nProperty “that Colonel Francis and the officers of the First and Second\r\nBattalions of the Pennsylvania Regiment be allowed to take up 24,000\r\nacres, to be divided among them in district surveys on the waters of the\r\nWest Branch of the Susquehanna, to be seated with a family for each 300\r\nacres, within two years from the time of the survey, paying £5 per\r\nhundred and one penny sterling per acre.”\r\n\r\nNear the close of February many of the officers met at Fort Augusta and\r\nagreed to take the land proposed by the Proprietaries, and that one of\r\nthe tracts should be surveyed on the West Branch, adjoining Andrew\r\nMontour’s place at Chillisquaque Creek, and one in Buffalo Valley. It\r\nwas also agreed that Captains Plunket, Brady, Piper and Lieutenant Askey\r\nshould accompany William Scull to the eastern side of the river as they\r\nmade the surveys.\r\n\r\nThese surveys were promptly made and another meeting was held at Fort\r\nAugusta, when it was determined that the third tract of 8000 acres\r\nshould be surveyed on Bald Eagle Creek. Captains Hunter, Brady and Piper\r\nwere appointed to accompany Charles Lukens as he made the survey.\r\n\r\nMay 16, 1769, the officers met at Harris Ferry, where Messrs. Maclay,\r\nScull and Lukens laid before them the drafts of their respective\r\nsurveys. They agreed that Colonel Turbutt Francis should receive his\r\nshare, 2075 acres, surveyed to him in one tract. Accordingly he selected\r\nland upon which the town of Milton is now the center.\r\n\r\nLots were then drawn by the other officers for the choice of lands.\r\nCaptain William Hendricks, Captain William Plunket, Captain John Brady,\r\nCaptain John Kern, Lieutenant Dr. Thomas Wiggins, Captain Conrad Bucher,\r\nCaptain William Irvine and Lieutenants Askey, Stewart and McAllister\r\ntook land in Buffalo Valley.\r\n\r\nEnsign A. Stein, Lieutenant Daniel Hunsicker, Captain William Piper,\r\nLieutenant James Hayes, Captain Samuel Hunter, Captain Nicholas\r\nHausegger took lands above Chillisquaque Creek. Major John Philip de\r\nHaas was the principal officer to be awarded land on the Bald Eagle, and\r\nnear him were Lieutenant James Hays and Thomas Wiggans, Ensign William\r\nMcMeen, Lieutenant Hunsicker, Captain Timothy Green, Captain John Brady,\r\nCaptain James Irvine and Captain William Plunket.\r\n\r\nColonel Francis acquired by purchase land from Chillisquaque Creek to\r\nand including the present town of Northumberland, and then owned a\r\ncontinuous strip from the North Branch to a point near Watsontown, a\r\ndistance of eighteen miles along the West Branch. This made him one of\r\nthe most extensive land owners of that time.\r\n\r\nBy these awards the West Branch Valley was permanently settled by these\r\ndistinguished officers or their kin, and many of the families resident\r\nthere today are descendants of these sturdy patriots.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 British Foragers Massacre Americans at\r\n                      Crooked Billet, May 1, 1778\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the exception of occasional depredations committed by the British\r\nforaging parties during the winter of 1777–78, all was quiet on the\r\nDelaware. The vigilance of Generals James Potter and John Lacey greatly\r\nrestrained these forays. In the meantime General Washington, with the\r\naid of Baron von Steuben and other foreign officers in the Continental\r\narmy, transformed the band of American patriots into a well-disciplined,\r\nwell-drilled and confident army.\r\n\r\nGeneral Wayne’s command was encamped during the whole winter and spring\r\nat Mount Joy, in Montgomery County, and materially assisted in securing\r\nsupplies of provisions for the army at Valley Forge.\r\n\r\nWhen Washington withdrew from Whitemarsh, he was anxious that the upper\r\npart of the Delaware-Schuylkill peninsula should be well guarded. A\r\nthousand Pennsylvania militia were placed under command of General John\r\nLacey, January 9, 1778. Lacey established his headquarters at the\r\nCrooked Billet Tavern, Bucks County, now called Hatboro, about\r\ntwenty-five miles north of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThe country nearer Philadelphia, where the British were encamped, was\r\nthus open to the Queen’s Rangers and James’ and Hovenden’s Loyalists,\r\nwho foraged and ravaged as they pleased. There was intense hatred\r\nbetween these Tories and the Continentals.\r\n\r\nThe British continually employed troops to forage and plunder, and while\r\nLacey was himself in Bucks County, he could do nothing to save it from\r\ntheir ravages. But his energy and enterprise, even with his small\r\nforces, enabled him to reduce the supplies of Philadelphia so materially\r\nthat the attempt was made to destroy his command, and an expedition was\r\nsent against him.\r\n\r\nThe party was under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Abercrombie,\r\ncomprising light infantry, cavalry and Simcoe’s Rangers, and started on\r\nMay 1, 1778. Simcoe was to get in Lacey’s rear and a party was to be\r\nplaced in ambush, while the mounted infantry and cavalry advanced along\r\nthe road.\r\n\r\nLacey’s officers and patrols were negligent, and his force was\r\ncompletely surprised and surrounded on all sides. They retreated\r\nfighting, but without their baggage, and finally got away with a loss of\r\ntwenty-six killed, eight or ten wounded, and fifty-eight missing.\r\n\r\nThe British, as at Paoli, bayoneted many of the American troops after\r\nthey were so seriously wounded they could be of no further effect\r\nagainst them; others of the wounded were thrown in among some buckwheat\r\nstraw, which was then set on fire, and they were roasted to death. The\r\nbodies of many of the killed among the Americans were then thrown into\r\nthe burning straw. The famous scoundrels who committed these atrocities\r\nwere the Tory soldiers of Simcoe’s Rangers. The British loss was\r\nnominal.\r\n\r\nAmong the American slain in this massacre was Captain John Downey, who\r\nhad been a schoolmaster in Philadelphia and a gallant volunteer at\r\nTrenton and Princeton. He had surveyed the Delaware River for the\r\nCommittee of Safety, and was acting as commissary to General Lacey’s\r\nbrigade. He was bayoneted and mutilated while lying wounded and a\r\nprisoner at the Crooked Billet.\r\n\r\nA monument was erected in December, 1861, to the victims of Lacey’s\r\ncommand in this fight, on the battlefield at Hatboro. The surprise was a\r\nlegitimate act of war, but the massacre after surrender was a barbarous\r\natrocity.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Executive Council of the State, and the Assembly in session\r\nat Lancaster, and the Continental Congress at York had been principally\r\nengaged in legislating for the interests of the army, preparing for the\r\nensuing campaign. The Assembly passed the “act for the attainder of\r\ndivers traitors,” among whom were specially mentioned Joseph Galloway,\r\nAndrew Allen, Reverend Jacob Duche, John Biddle, John Allen, William\r\nAllen, James Rankin, of York County, Gilbert Hicks, of Bucks County,\r\nSamuel Shoemaker, late of Penn’s Council, John Potts, Nathaniel Vernon,\r\nex-Sheriff of Chester County, Christian Fouts, formerly\r\nlieutenant-colonel in Lancaster militia, Reynold Keen and John Biddle,\r\nlatter two of Berks County. Reverend Duche had made the prayer at the\r\nopening of the first Continental Congress and since had been chaplain to\r\nCongress, but had prayed for the King.\r\n\r\nJoseph Galloway’s estate was worth in excess of £40,000 sterling, and\r\nhis handsome home on the southeast corner of Sixth and High Streets in\r\nPhiladelphia, was appropriated by the State of Pennsylvania as a\r\nresidence for the President of the Supreme Executive Council, who was\r\nthe chief executive officer of the State. This house was afterwards sold\r\nto Robert Morris.\r\n\r\nThrough the influence and negotiations of Benjamin Franklin Silas Deane\r\nand Arthur Lee, Commissioners sent to Paris by Congress, France had now\r\nopenly espoused the American cause. The joyful news reached Congress\r\nsitting at York, May 2, 1778.\r\n\r\nOn May 7, Lord Howe was superseded by Sir Henry Clinton. Previous to the\r\nBritish commander’s departure, a magnificent fete called the\r\n“Mischianza,” was held May 18 in his honor.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, Lafayette with 2500 men and eight cannon crossed\r\nthe Schuylkill to Barren Hill. Howe, with 5700 under Clinton and\r\nKnyphausen, supported by Grant in his rear, with 5,300 troops, marched\r\nto overwhelm this important post of the American army. Lafayette escaped\r\nby Matson’s Ford. Four days later, May 24, Howe embarked for England.\r\n\r\nThe same day a council of war was held under Sir Henry Clinton, and it\r\nwas resolved to evacuate the city, which event occurred on June 19. This\r\nmovement had been delayed owing to the arrival on June 6, of three\r\nBritish Commissioners to negotiate peace and a reconciliation. It was\r\ntoo late.\r\n\r\nAmong other intrigues, it is stated, the Commissioners secretly offered\r\nto General Joseph Reed, then delegate to Congress, and afterwards\r\nPresident of the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania, £10,000\r\nsterling, with the best office in the Colonies to promote their plans.\r\nGeneral Reed promptly replied: “I am not worth purchasing, but such as I\r\nam, the King of Great Britain is not rich enough to do it.”\r\n\r\nUpon occupation of Philadelphia, General Benedict Arnold was ordered by\r\nGeneral Washington to take command of the city, and “prevent the\r\ndisorders which were expected upon the evacuation of the place and\r\nreturn of the Whigs after being so long kept out of their property.”\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                General Edward Hand Relieved of Command\r\n                        Following Squaw Campaign\r\n                              May 2, 1778\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some time General Washington had believed that the permanent safety\r\nof the western section of Pennsylvania could only be secured by carrying\r\non a successful war, in an aggressive manner, against the enemy in their\r\nown country. That determination was strengthened by the Commissioners of\r\nCongress, who met in Pittsburgh late in 1777, and learned first handed\r\nof the barbarous warfare carried on against the western frontier by the\r\nBritish under Henry Hamilton, then Governor of Detroit, with the\r\nassistance of their Indian allies.\r\n\r\nDuring October and November, 1777, while General Edward Hand, then\r\ncommandant at Fort Pitt, was trying to recruit his army for the invasion\r\nof the Indian country, many raids were made in Westmoreland County.\r\nEleven men were killed and scalped near Palmer’s Fort, in Ligonier\r\nValley, and a few days later four children were killed within sight of\r\nthe fort. Three men were killed and a woman captured within a few miles\r\nof Ligonier. A band of Indians, led by a Canadian, made a fierce attack\r\non Fort Wallace, near Blairsville, but the Canadian was killed and the\r\nsavages repulsed. These maurauders were pursued by a party of rangers\r\nled by Captain James Smith and overtaken near Kittanning, where five\r\nredskins were killed and scalped. The snows of winter prevented other\r\nravages.\r\n\r\nDuring the Christmas holidays General Hand learned that the British had\r\nbuilt a magazine where Cleveland now stands and had stored arms,\r\nammunition, clothing and provisions in it for the use of the Indians in\r\nthe spring. He immediately planned an expedition for the destruction of\r\nthe magazine. His call for troops required each man to be mounted and\r\nprovided with food for a short campaign. He promised to provide the arms\r\nand ammunition.\r\n\r\nThe general proposed, as a special inducement to enlist, that all\r\nplunder would be sold and the cash proceeds divided among the force.\r\nFebruary 15, about 500 horsemen were at Pittsburgh ready for the\r\nadventure, and this considerable force caused General Hand to be\r\nsanguine for its success.\r\n\r\nThe expedition followed the old Indian trail which descended the Ohio\r\nRiver to the Beaver and then ascended that stream and the Mahoning\r\ntoward the Cuyahoga. The snow on the ground was soon melted by heavy\r\nrains and the marching was made difficult.\r\n\r\nBy the time the Mahoning was reached that stream was almost impassable,\r\neven some of the level lands were covered with water for wide stretches.\r\nThe horsemen grumbled and Hand too was so discouraged that he was about\r\nto give up the expedition and return, when the foot-prints of some\r\nIndians were discovered on the high ground.\r\n\r\nThe tracks led to a small village, where a sudden attack was made, but\r\nthe place contained only one old man, some squaws and children. The\r\nwarriors were away on a hunt. The startled savages scattered and all\r\nescaped except the old man and one woman, who were shot and a woman\r\ntaken prisoner.\r\n\r\nThis affair took place about where Edenburg is, in Lawrence County. The\r\nIndian told her captors that ten Wolf, or Munsee, Indians were making\r\nsalt ten miles farther up the Mahoning. Hand dispatched a detachment\r\nafter these savages and he went into camp under uncomfortable\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe reported Munsee proved to be four squaws and a boy. The soldiers\r\nkilled three of the squaws and the boy, the other squaw was taken\r\nprisoner. One of the soldiers was wounded here and another drowned\r\nduring the march.\r\n\r\nThe weather conditions made further campaigns impossible and General\r\nHand led his dispirited and hungry men back to Fort Pitt. The trophies\r\nwere two Indian women. His formidable force had slain one old man, four\r\nwomen and a boy. On his arrival at Fort Pitt his work was generally\r\nderided by the frontiersmen and his expedition was dubbed the Squaw\r\nCampaign.\r\n\r\nThis finished General Hand as an Indian fighter. He asked General\r\nWashington to relieve him and May 2, 1778, Congress voted his recall and\r\ncommissioned General Lachlan McIntosh to succeed him.\r\n\r\nGeneral Edward Hand won distinction in other directions. He was born at\r\nElzduffs, Kings County, Ireland, December 31, 1744.\r\n\r\nIn 1767 he was appointed by George III surgeon of the 18th Royal Irish\r\nRegiment of foot, and sailed with the regiment from Cork on May 20 of\r\nthe same year, arriving in Philadelphia July 11.\r\n\r\nHe served with this regiment at Fort Pitt and returning to Philadelphia\r\nin 1774, resigned his commission, receiving a regular discharge from the\r\nBritish service. In the same year he went to Lancaster and began the\r\npractice of his profession.\r\n\r\nHe joined the First Battalion of Pennsylvania Riflemen as\r\nlieutenant-colonel at the outbreak of the Revolution and served in the\r\nsiege of Boston. He was promoted to colonel in 1776, and led his\r\nregiment in the Battle of Long Island, and also at Trenton. In April,\r\n1777, he was appointed brigadier-general; and in this capacity served in\r\ncommand of the Western Department until relieved May 2, 1778; in October\r\nfollowing he succeeded General Stark in command at Albany.\r\n\r\nIn the successful expedition against the Six Nations Indians in 1779,\r\nled by General John Sullivan, General Hand was an active participant.\r\n\r\nNear the close of 1780, General Hand succeeded General Scammel as\r\nadjutant-general. He was an intimate friend of General Washington and\r\nhad his full confidence during the entire struggle of the colonies. He\r\nwas one of the original members of the Order of the Cincinnati.\r\n\r\nIn 1785 General Hand was elected to the Assembly; then he was a member\r\nof Congress and assisted in the formation of the Constitution of\r\nPennsylvania in 1789, when the second Constitution of the State was\r\nwritten, and adopted the following year.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hand died at Rockford, Lancaster County, September 3, 1802.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Evangelist Whitefield Bought Site for Negro\r\n                     School at Nazareth May 3, 1740\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Reverend George Whitefield was an exceeding earnest worker for the\r\ngood of souls. He came to America and spent much of his time in Georgia,\r\nwhere he preached effectively and established an orphan house and school\r\nnear Savannah, laying the first brick himself for the building, March\r\n25, 1740. He named it “Bethesda”—a house of mercy. It afterward became\r\neminently useful.\r\n\r\nWhitefield undertook to found a school for Negroes in Pennsylvania, and\r\nwith it a settlement for persons converted in England by his preaching\r\nand subjected to annoyance on that account.\r\n\r\nAn agreement for a site was made with William Allen, May 3, 1740, when\r\n5000 acres of land were purchased, situated at the Forks of the\r\nDelaware, the consideration being £2200. The title was made to\r\nWhitefield and then assigned to his friend William Seward, who was a man\r\nof considerable wealth, as security for Seward’s advancing the purchase\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nTwo days afterward Whitefield preached in the morning at the German\r\nsettlement on the Skippack Creek to about 5000 persons, and in the\r\nevening, after riding twelve miles to Henry Antes’, he preached to about\r\n3000. The Moravian Boehler followed with an address in German.\r\n\r\nDuring this same day Whitefield offered to hire as builders the\r\nMoravians who had arrived from Savannah on the sloop with him.\r\n\r\nWhitefield and the Moravians then visited the ground, when the latter,\r\nby the cast of the lot, according to their custom, felt directed to\r\nengage in the enterprise.\r\n\r\nSeward, several days after the purchase of the site was made, sailed\r\nfrom Philadelphia for England, partly to convert some securities into\r\ncash and also to solicit further contributions. He was accidentally hit\r\non the head while at Caerleon, Wales, from the effect of which blow he\r\ndied a few days later, October 22, 1740.\r\n\r\nThe Moravians arrived in that part of Northampton County, which is now\r\nwithin the limits of Upper and Lower Nazareth and Bethlehem Townships,\r\nand there commenced to erect a large stone house which Whitefield\r\nproposed to use as the school for Negroes. This tract its proprietor\r\nnamed Nazareth.\r\n\r\nHere the Moravians worked for the remainder of the year and by their\r\nefforts had built two houses. But at this time there arose a dispute\r\nbetween Whitefield and those employed on the buildings. It is believed\r\nWhitefield disapproved of Boehler’s doctrinal opinions and, unable in an\r\nargument conducted in Latin to convince him, discharged the workmen.\r\n\r\nThe Moravians were allowed to stay on the property for some time by\r\nAllen’s agent, but the whole project failed, largely through Seward’s\r\ndeath. Whitefield again secured the title and cheerfully assigned it to\r\nthe Moravians.\r\n\r\nThe Moravian workmen were compelled to seek a new home. This they found\r\nwhen their Bishop, David Nitcshmann, secured a tract of 5000 acres at\r\nthe confluence of the Monocacy Creek and the Delaware River, on which,\r\nin March, 1741, they began to build Bethlehem. This eventually became\r\nthe principal settlement of the Moravians in the province.\r\n\r\nGeorge Whitefield was born in Gloucester, England, December 16, 1714,\r\nand entered Oxford in 1732. He was a religious enthusiast in very early\r\nlife, fasting twice a week for thirty-six hours and while an\r\nundergraduate became a member of the “Holy Club,” in which the\r\ndenomination of Methodists took its rise.\r\n\r\nWhitefield became intimately associated in religious matters with John\r\nand Charles Wesley. He was made deacon by the Bishop of Gloucester on\r\nSunday, June 20, 1736, two weeks before his graduation, and attracted\r\nattention even by his first sermon; he drew such crowds in London and\r\nBristol that people hung upon the rails of the organ loft and climbed in\r\nthe windows.\r\n\r\nThe Wesleys accompanied Oglethorpe to Georgia in 1736 and the following\r\nyear John Wesley invited Whitefield to join him in his work in America.\r\nHe came in May, 1738, and after laboring for months as a missionary in\r\nthe colony of Georgia he returned to England and was ordained priest at\r\nOxford, Sunday, January 14, 1739. On his way a second time to Georgia he\r\nfirst visited Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nWhitefield and his friend, William Seward, arrived in Philadelphia in\r\nthe evening of Friday, November 2, 1739, on horseback from Lewes, where\r\nthey had disembarked.\r\n\r\nHe read prayers and assisted at Christ Church in the services of the\r\nfollowing Sunday, and preached there in the afternoon and every day for\r\nthe rest of the week with increasing congregations. He dined at Thomas\r\nPenn’s, and was visited by the ministers of the Presbyterian and Baptist\r\nChurches and by many Quakers. He preached twice to more than three\r\nthousand persons.\r\n\r\nHe made a trip to New York, and on his return preached from the yard of\r\nthe Reverend William Tennent’s church on the Neshaminy to about three\r\nthousand, and from the porch window of the Presbyterian Church at\r\nAbington, and again several times at Christ Church.\r\n\r\nWhen Whitefield was to preach his farewell sermon in the afternoon of\r\nNovember 28, the church not being large enough for those expected he\r\nadjourned to the fields, and preached to 10,000. Twenty gentlemen on\r\nhorseback accompanied him out of town. At Chester he spoke from a\r\nbalcony to 5000, of whom one-fifth had come from Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nHe was energetically philanthropic. His main purpose in going back to\r\nGeorgia was to carry on his work among the poor orphans.\r\n\r\nOn Boston Common he preached to 20,000 at one time, and was distinctly\r\nheard.\r\n\r\nAlthough he was active in the establishment of the Methodist\r\ndenomination, he disagreed with Wesley on points of doctrine, and was\r\nfinally an evangelist without the discipline of any denomination.\r\n\r\nWhitefield crossed the ocean many times, and made tours from Georgia to\r\nNew Hampshire. In September, 1769, he started on his seventh tour there,\r\nand the day before his death he preached two hours at Exeter, N. H., and\r\nthe same evening preached in the open air at Newburyport, Mass. He died\r\nof asthma the next day, September 30, 1770, and was buried under the\r\npulpit of the Federal Street Church in that town.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Trial of Five Mollie Maguires for Murder\r\n                   of B. F. Yost Begun at Pottsville\r\n                              May 4, 1876\r\n\r\n\r\nOn May 4, 1876, James Carroll, Thomas Duffy, James Roarty, Hugh McGehan,\r\nand James Boyle, were placed on trial in Schuylkill County Court at\r\nPottsville, for the murder of Benjamin F. Yost, of Tamaqua.\r\n\r\nThe details of this revolting crime and the apprehension of the Mollie\r\nMaguires are of interest as they reveal the terrible horrors experienced\r\nin the anthracite coal fields during the reign of this lawless\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nJames McParlan, the Pinkerton detective, who joined the Mollies under\r\nthe alias of James McKenna, and successfully brought their leaders to\r\nthe gallows, was working on the Gomer James murder outrage, when he\r\nlearned that the next victim was to be an excellent and competent\r\npoliceman of Tamaqua, of the name of Benjamin F. Yost.\r\n\r\nMcParlan had been unable to learn sufficient of their designs to get a\r\nwarning to Yost, as he had so frequently done in other cases.\r\n\r\nYost had experienced considerable trouble with the Mollies, especially\r\nas he had several times arrested James Kerrigan, their local leader, for\r\ndrunkenness. Barney McCarron, the other member of the Tamaqua police\r\nforce, had also come in for his share of their ill-will, but, from his\r\nGerman parentage, Yost was the more intensely hated. Yost had been\r\nthreatened several times but was a fearless man, a veteran of the Civil\r\nWar, where he displayed conspicuous valor on many battlefields, and a\r\npoliceman who served his community with fidelity.\r\n\r\nAbout midnight of July 5, 1875, the two policemen in passing Carroll’s\r\nsaloon, noted that the place was still open, went inside and saw\r\nKerrigan and another man drinking.\r\n\r\nThe policemen proceeded with their duties, and extinguished the street\r\nlamps on their route. They arrived at Yost’s residence about two o’clock\r\nand partook of a lunch, preparatory to finishing up the night’s work.\r\n\r\nThe two officers parted at Yost’s front gate, and Mrs. Yost, looking out\r\nof her bedroom window, saw her husband place a small ladder against a\r\nlamp post a short distance from their home, and step upon the rungs, but\r\nhe never reached the light.\r\n\r\nThe woman saw two flashes from a pistol; heard the two loud reports and\r\nsaw her husband fall from the ladder. She ran down the stairs and into\r\nthe street, and met the wounded man, staggering and weak with loss of\r\nblood, clinging to the fence, looking toward his once happy home.\r\n\r\nYost lived long enough to say that his murderers were two Irishmen who\r\nhad been in Carroll’s saloon that evening. He exonerated Kerrigan of the\r\ncrime, saying one was larger and the other smaller than he. He did not\r\nsee Kerrigan.\r\n\r\nYost died at nine o’clock that morning; he was then thirty-three years\r\nof age.\r\n\r\nMcParlan was soon on the trail of the Mollies who committed this cruel\r\nmurder, and Captain Linden, another Pinkerton operative, was also active\r\non the case.\r\n\r\nMcParlan was at this time under suspicion by the Mollies of being a\r\ndetective and his work was the most dangerous any man was ever called\r\nupon to perform, but he was a hero.\r\n\r\nHe now affected the role of a drunken man and while sleeping off his\r\ndebauch listened to a conversation which gave him a clue; he then fell\r\nin with Carroll, engaged his wife in conversation and soon learned much\r\nof importance.\r\n\r\nThe next day he learned the names of two of the men who had killed Yost,\r\nHugh McGehan and James Boyle, both of Summit Hill.\r\n\r\nThe following day he went to Coaldale and visited James Roarty, head of\r\nthe Mollie branch there, ostensibly to see another person. Here they had\r\na drinking bout, and Roarty told too much, and he was Mollie number\r\nthree.\r\n\r\nTwo days later McParlan was back in Tamaqua and lounging about Carroll’s\r\nsaloon where he got more information from Roarty and Carroll. He then\r\nlearned that Thomas Duffy was an actor in the crime.\r\n\r\nSunday, July 26, McParlan and Carroll spent some time together, when the\r\nlatter related the conversation he had had with some detectives (which\r\nMcParlan had sent there), and boasted about loaning his pistol to the\r\nman who did the job. This made Carroll number four.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards Duffy bragged to McParlan of the part he had taken and\r\nthe fifth Mollie was trapped.\r\n\r\nAll that was then needed was to gather his evidence so that it could be\r\nused against these criminals, and for this purpose Captain Linden was\r\nmost valuable.\r\n\r\nKerrigan took McParlan to the scene of the murder and enacted the crime\r\nfor his friend’s benefit, and soon after this incident the detective\r\nlearned that McGehan fired the two shots which killed Yost.\r\n\r\nThis is the same James Kerrigan who turned State’s evidence in the great\r\ntrial of Mollies at Mauch Chunk, January 18, 1876, which resulted in the\r\nconviction of Kerrigan, Michael J. Doyle, and Edward Kelly for the\r\nmurder of John P. Jones. Kerrigan’s evidence was the most stunning blow\r\nthe Mollies had thus far received, but they knew not the heavier blows\r\nwhich were to fall on their villainous heads.\r\n\r\nThe great trial of Thomas Munley and Charles McAllister for the murder\r\nof Thomas Sanger and William Uren, which was held at Pottsville, June,\r\n1876, brought the great Franklin B. Gowen into the case, and the\r\ntestimony of McParlan, the Pinkerton detective. Conviction followed.\r\n\r\nThen May 4, when the five Mollies were placed on trial at Pottsville for\r\nthe murder of Yost. Judges C. L. Pershing, D. B. Green and T. H. Walker\r\npresided.\r\n\r\nA juror was taken sick and died, and the second trial was begun July 6,\r\neach of the Mollies was found guilty of murder in the first degree, and\r\neach was hanged in the Pottsville jail yard, the warrants being signed\r\nby Governor Hartranft, May 21, 1877, the executions being held June 21,\r\nthe day eight Mollies expiated their crimes.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   French and Indian Wars—Lieutenant\r\n                        Governor Thomas Resigned\r\n                              May 5, 1747\r\n\r\n\r\nCoincident with the announcement in the Assembly of the death of John\r\nPenn, one of the Proprietors, was the resignation of Lieutenant Governor\r\nSir George Thomas, May 5, 1747, on account of ill-health.\r\n\r\nOn the departure of Governor Thomas, the executive functions again\r\ndevolved on the Provincial Council, of which Anthony Palmer was\r\npresident; he served until the arrival of James Hamilton, son of Andrew\r\nHamilton, former Speaker of the Assembly, as Lieutenant Governor,\r\nNovember 23, 1749.\r\n\r\nThe harvests of the years 1750 to 1752 were so abundant that an extract\r\nof the time is interesting: “The years 1751 and 1752 have been so\r\nfruitful in wheat and other grain that men in wanton carelessness sought\r\nto waste the supply: for the precious wheat which might have supported\r\nmany poor, they used to fatten hogs, which afterward they consumed in\r\ntheir sumptuousness. Besides, distilleries were erected everywhere, and\r\nthus this great blessing was turned into strong drink, which gave rise\r\nto much disorder.\r\n\r\nThese years of plenty were followed by three years of scarcity,\r\n1753–1755, and on the heels of it came the terrible Indian hostilities.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the white population toward the West alarmed and\r\nirritated the Indians. The new settlers did not suffer the delays of the\r\nland office, nor did they pay for their lands, but in search for richer\r\nsoils sought homes in regions where the Indian title had not been\r\nextinguished. Some of these settlements were commenced prior to 1740,\r\nand rapidly increased, despite the complaints of the Indians, the laws\r\nof the Province or the several proclamations of the Governor.\r\n\r\nAn alarming crisis was now at hand. The French in the neighborhood of\r\nthe Great Lakes were sedulously applying themselves to seduce the\r\nIndians from their allegiance to the English. The Shawnee had already\r\njoined the French cause; the Delaware only waited for an opportunity to\r\navenge their wrongs; and of the Six Nations, the Onondaga, Cayuga and\r\nSeneca were wavering and listening to overtures from the agents of both\r\nthe English and French.\r\n\r\nTo keep the Indians in favor of the province required much cunning\r\ndiplomacy and many expensive presents. In the midst of this alarming\r\ncondition the old flame of civil dissension burst out with increased\r\nfury. The presents so frequently procured for the Indians, the erection\r\nof a chain of forts along the frontier and the maintenance of a military\r\nforce drew too heavily upon the provincial purse, which never was\r\nburdened with any great surplus.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly urged that the Proprietary estates be taxed, as well as\r\nthose of humble individuals. The Proprietaries, as would be expected,\r\nrefused to be taxed and pleaded prerogative, charter and law; the\r\nAssembly in turn pleaded equity, common danger, common benefit and at\r\ncommon expense.\r\n\r\nThe Proprietaries offered bounties in lands not yet acquired from the\r\nIndians by treaty or purchase, and in addition proposed the issuing of\r\nmore paper money. The Assembly was not satisfied; they wanted something\r\nmore tangible. They passed laws laying taxes and granting supplies, but\r\nthe Proprietaries opposed the conditions. They were willing to aid the\r\nAssembly in taxing the people, but not the Proprietaries. Here were sown\r\nthe germs of the Revolution, though not fully matured until twenty years\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nDuring those frivolous disputes in the Assembly the frontiers were left\r\nfully exposed. The pacific principles, too, of the Quakers, Dunkards,\r\nMennonites and Schwenckfelders came in to complicate the strife, but as\r\nthe danger increased they prudently kept aloof from public office,\r\nleaving the management of the war to sects less scrupulous. The pulpit\r\nand the press were deeply involved, and the inhabitants divided into\r\nopposing factions upon this question.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle was scarcely regarded more seriously than\r\na truce by the French in America. In their eagerness to extend their\r\nterritories and connect their northern possessions with Louisiana, they\r\nprojected a line of forts and military posts from one to the other along\r\nthe Mississippi and Ohio Rivers. They explored and occupied the land\r\nupon the latter stream, buried in many places leaden plates, by which\r\nthey claimed possession of those lands.\r\n\r\nThe French established themselves at Presqu’ Isle and extended\r\nthemselves southward; they erected a fort at Au Boeuf and another at the\r\nmouth of French Creek, which they called Fort Machault.\r\n\r\nVirginia was much interested in this foothold gained by the French along\r\nthe Ohio, for they claimed the territory of Pennsylvania west of the\r\nAllegheny Mountains as part of their dominion.\r\n\r\nThe English Government having learned that the French claimed right to\r\nthe Ohio River country by virtue of the discovery of La Salle, made\r\nsixty years previous, remonstrated with the Court of Versailles, but\r\nwithout avail, and resolved to oppose force with force.\r\n\r\nThe first move made by the English was to present a solid front by\r\ncombining the efforts of all the colonies. To this end a conference was\r\ncalled at Albany in July, 1754, to which the Six Nations were invited.\r\nGovernor Hamilton could not attend this conference, and John Penn and\r\nRichard Peters, of the Council, and Isaac Norris and Benjamin Franklin,\r\nof the Assembly, were commissioned to represent the Province of\r\nPennsylvania. They carried with them £500 as the provincial present to\r\nthe Indians.\r\n\r\nThe results of this confederated council were not satisfactory, but the\r\nPennsylvania Commissioners obtained a great part of the land in the\r\nprovince, to which the Indian title was not extinct, comprising the\r\nlands lying southwest of a line beginning one mile above the mouth of\r\nPenns Creek, in what is now Snyder County, and running northwest by west\r\n“to the western boundary of the State.”\r\n\r\nThe Shawnee, Delaware and Munsee Indians, on the Susquehanna, Juniata,\r\nAllegheny and Ohio Rivers, thus found their lands “sold from under their\r\nfeet,” which the Six Nations had guaranteed to them on their removal\r\nfrom the Eastern waters. This proved of great dissatisfaction to these\r\nIndians and had not a little part in causing their alienation from the\r\nEnglish interest.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Work Begun on Building Braddock Road\r\n\r\nOver Alleghenies May 6, 1755\r\n\r\n\r\nPreparatory to the ill-fated expedition of General Braddock, which\r\nprecipitated the forays of the French and Indians upon the unprotected\r\nfrontiers of Pennsylvania, was the letter to Governor Morris, of\r\nPennsylvania, asking to have a road cut so that there might be\r\ncommunication between Philadelphia and the Three Forks of the\r\nYoughiogheny, both for the security of retreat and to facilitate the\r\ntransport of provisions. These English officers were unacquainted with\r\nAmerican geography, and at best the maps used by them were by no means\r\naccurate.\r\n\r\nGovernor Morris in response advised Sir John St. Clair, deputy\r\nquartermaster general, that there was a very good wagon road from\r\nPhiladelphia to the mouth of the Conococheague, but only a horse path\r\nthrough the mountains by which the Indian traders carried their goods,\r\nand that there would be great difficulty in making a wagon road that\r\nway. He also gently intimated that the distance was much greater than\r\nthe English officers realized.\r\n\r\nGovernor Morris, with the sanction of the Assembly, sent George Croghan,\r\nJohn Armstrong, James Burd, William Buchanan and Adam Hoopes as\r\ncommissioners to explore the country west of the “Great Virginia Road,”\r\nas the road through the Cumberland Valley was called, and to survey and\r\nlay out such roads as were most direct and commodious. No better men\r\ncould have been chosen. They were acquainted with the country, and\r\nArmstrong was the best surveyor on the frontier.\r\n\r\nThese commissioners projected a road from McDowell’s Mill, in present\r\nFranklin County, to within eighteen miles of the Three Forks, where they\r\nfound too many French and Indians scouting and hunting to venture\r\nfarther. The length of projected road so far as it was surveyed was\r\nsixty-nine miles.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners could not effect a meeting with Sir John until April\r\n16. When they showed him the drafts he raved like a wild man, and the\r\ncommissioners, believing they had done their part well, were abashed by\r\ntheir unusual reception.\r\n\r\nSir John told them it was too late to build this road now, and instead\r\nof marching to the Ohio they would march into Cumberland County. Not a\r\nsoldier should handle an ax, but by fire and sword General Braddock\r\nwould compel the inhabitants to build it. He would kill all the cattle\r\nand drive away the horses, burn the houses, and if the French defeated\r\nthe army by the delays of the Province, he would, with his sword drawn,\r\npass through it and treat the inhabitants as a parcel of traitors to his\r\nmaster. He even avowed his purpose to “shake Mr. Penn’s Proprietaryship”\r\nby representing Pennsylvania as a disaffected province.\r\n\r\nBraddock was constantly complaining of the failure of Pennsylvania and\r\nVirginia. He spoke slightingly of the provincial contingent and scoffed\r\nat danger from the Indians. “These savages,” he said to Franklin, “may\r\nindeed be a formidable enemy to raw American militia, but upon the\r\nKing’s regular and disciplined troops, sir, it is impossible they should\r\nmake an impression.”\r\n\r\nGovernor Morris early in May sent Secretary Peters to expedite the work\r\nof the road-makers by his presence. Neither General Braddock nor Sir\r\nJohn had any distinct idea of the obstacles to road-building over the\r\nPennsylvania mountains or of the difficulties which confronted Governor\r\nMorris in a work of such magnitude, who lacked both money and men for\r\nthe undertaking.\r\n\r\nThis road, which afterward received the name of Braddock’s Road, passed\r\nbeyond McDowell’s Mill, around Parnell’s and Jordan’s Knobs into Path\r\nValley, into Cowan’s Gap, past Burnt Cabins and Sugar Cabins to Sideling\r\nHill. From the latter point the road extended to the crossing of the\r\nJuniata, thence to Raystown (now Bedford), and it then went over the\r\nAlleghenies to the Great Crossing, three miles from Turkey’s Foot.\r\n\r\nThe entire expense of making the road was to be paid by the Province.\r\nAdvertisements were broadcasted in Cumberland, York and Lancaster\r\nCounties for laborers. James Wright and John Smith contracted to supply\r\nthe workmen with provisions.\r\n\r\nGround was broken May 6, 1755, when only ten men reported for work under\r\ncommand of James Burd. By the 15th there were seventy men at work and by\r\nthe end of the month 120.\r\n\r\nMr. Burd was in sole charge of the work at the outset, the other\r\ncommissioners being too busy—Croghan with the Indian contingent ordered\r\nby Braddock, Armstrong with complications growing out of the purchase of\r\n1754 and Buchanan and Hoopes with their private affairs.\r\n\r\nThe road was built thirty feet wide for about ten miles, when it was\r\ndetermined to make it twenty feet, and parts requiring digging or\r\nquarrying only ten feet.\r\n\r\nTwenty days were required to make the road from Anthony Thompson’s to\r\nSideling Hill, a distance of nineteen miles. William Smith was\r\ncommissioned to assist Mr. Burd and reported May 28.\r\n\r\nMuch of the money required for the work was supplied by Joseph Armstrong\r\nand Samuel Smith, members of the Assembly from Cumberland County, from\r\ntheir private purse, for the Legislature held its pursestrings with a\r\ntight grip. The workmen at times suffered for the want of bread and\r\nliquor.\r\n\r\nBy June 16, Mr. Burd wrote from “Alloqueepy’s Town,” thirty-four and a\r\nhalf miles from Thompson’s, that he expected to finish the work there\r\nthe next day, and join the advance division, under Smith, at Raystown.\r\n\r\nThe Indians menaced the work at this time and Braddock, who at first\r\nrefused aid, sent 100 men, under Captain Hogg, as a guard. The soldiers\r\ncame none too soon.\r\n\r\nAs Braddock penetrated the Alleghenies, Indian ravages began in his\r\nrear. True to their character, the savages spared neither sex nor age.\r\nThe soldiers deserted and the workmen were unprotected and in constant\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nBy July 5 the road was completed to the eastern base of the Alleghenies.\r\n\r\nOn the day that Braddock’s body was buried at Great Meadows, John\r\nArmstrong wrote to him from Carlisle to say that the new road would soon\r\nbe completed. It was too late. Braddock had no further need for a road,\r\nexcept a spot for a burial place in that great highway over which he had\r\nmarched to defeat with so much military pomp.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                George Croghan, King of Traders, Sent on\r\n\r\nMission to Logstown May 7, 1751\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Croghan and Andrew Montour were sent, May 7, 1751, to Logstown to\r\ncarry a Provincial present to the Indians. While there the wily Irishman\r\nmet Joncaire, the French Indian agent, but succeeded in outwitting him\r\nin diplomacy; and the chiefs ordered the French from their lands and\r\nreasserted their friendship for the English. At this time the Indians\r\nrequested Croghan to ask Governor Hamilton to build a strong house on\r\nthe Ohio River for the protection of their wives and children in event\r\nthey should be obliged to engage in war.\r\n\r\nGeorge Croghan, next to Sir William Johnson, was the most prominent\r\nfigure among British-Indian agents during the period of the later French\r\nwars and the conspiracy of Pontiac, from 1746 until the Revolutionary\r\nWar, when he unfortunately cast his lot with the British.\r\n\r\nHe was born in Ireland and educated at Dublin, and emigrated to America\r\nin 1741. He settled in Pennsylvania near John Harris’ Ferry, now\r\nHarrisburg. He became an Indian trader in 1744, and was made a Councilor\r\nof the Six Nations at Onondaga in 1746.\r\n\r\nCroghan first appears in the official correspondence of Pennsylvania as\r\nwriting to Secretary Richard Peters, May 26, 1747, that he had just\r\nreturned from the woods, bringing a letter, a French scalp, and some\r\nwampum, for the Governor from a party of the Six Nations Indians having\r\ntheir dwelling on the borders of Lake Erie, who had formerly been in the\r\nFrench interest; and who now, thanks to Croghan’s diplomacy, had\r\ndeclared against the French.\r\n\r\nCroghan went to Logstown in April, 1748, with a message and present from\r\nPennsylvania Council to the Ohio Indians. Conrad Weiser carried a larger\r\npresent to these same Indians, and on his trip lodged in Croghan’s\r\nstorehouse in Logstown.\r\n\r\nIn 1750, Croghan accompanied Secretary Peters and other officials on a\r\ntrip among the settlers in Path, Tuscarora, Juniata and Aughwick Valleys\r\nwarning them off, burning their cabins and confining some of the\r\nintruders in prison.\r\n\r\nAt the great Shawnee Council at Logstown, he, Andrew Montour and\r\nChristopher Gist were present and Croghan boldly announced to the\r\nIndians that the French had offered a large sum of money to any one who\r\nwould bring them the bodies or scalps of Croghan or Montour. So the\r\nmission to Logstown, May 7, 1751, when the French-Indian Agent was\r\npresent, was a most unusual moment to the intrepid Croghan, and his\r\nalmost equally celebrated companion, Andrew Montour.\r\n\r\nCroghan succeeded in making a treaty between the Indians and Virginia\r\nCommissioners. He was again at Logstown, May 7, 1753, in company with\r\nWilliam Trent, Robert Callender and other traders, when a messenger\r\narrived with the news that the French were on Lake Erie in large force,\r\nwith brass cannon, on their way to the Ohio. Croghan held a conference\r\nwith Scarouady, the Half King, on May 12; and then attended an important\r\ncouncil between Pennsylvania Commissioners and chiefs of the Six\r\nNations, Shawnee, Delaware, Wyandot and Twightwee at Carlisle in\r\nOctober, 1753. About this time he was compelled, by impending bankruptcy\r\nand fear of being imprisoned for debt, to remove to the Indian country,\r\nand he built a house at Aughwick Old Town, near the Juniata.\r\n\r\nCroghan accompanied George Washington and his little army on the march\r\nfrom Fort Necessity to Redstone. When he returned to Aughwick he kept\r\nGovernor Morris informed of the movements of the French and their Indian\r\nallies.\r\n\r\nCroghan attended the important Indian conferences at Easton, Harris’\r\nFerry, Lancaster, Onondaga, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and other places,\r\nand always faithfully represented the English cause. He and Weiser were\r\nthe most active agents at Easton, June, 1762, when King Tedyuskung\r\nretracted his charges of fraud and forgery in land transactions made\r\nagainst the Proprietaries by him at Easton six years before.\r\n\r\nHe was commissioned captain and served with Braddock, when he commanded\r\na company of Indians. He resigned his commission in spring of 1756 and\r\njoined his fortunes with those of Sir William Johnson in the Mohawk\r\nValley. He was appointed a deputy in the Indian service, with the rank\r\nof colonel.\r\n\r\nDecember 1, 1763, he sailed for England to confer with the ministry\r\nabout some boundary lines, but he was shipwrecked off the coast of\r\nFrance and did not reach his destination until February, 1764.\r\n\r\nCroghan made an affidavit while in London which relates much of his\r\nearly movements. He also presented to the Lords of Trade an interesting\r\nMemorial on Indian Affairs in America.\r\n\r\nHe returned to Pennsylvania in October, 1764, and was induced to\r\ncontinue as Deputy Indian Agent in the Western Department.\r\n\r\nCroghan was sent by General Gage to Illinois for the purpose of making\r\npeace with the Indians. He embarked from Fort Pitt, May 15, 1765, and\r\nexperienced a hazardous trip during which his party was attacked by\r\nhostile Indians. He being severely wounded and taken prisoner, was\r\ncarried to what is now Lafayette, Indiana, where he was recognized by\r\nsome chiefs with whom he had previous dealings, and in spite of the fact\r\nthat the French demanded his execution, Croghan was liberated, July 18.\r\nHe set off that day for the Illinois country. On the way he met Pontiac\r\nand other chiefs, and effected the treaty he had been sent to make.\r\n\r\nColonel Croghan kept journals of all his trips and these are both\r\ninteresting and valuable. They reveal many exciting adventures and some\r\nvery harrowing experiences.\r\n\r\nCroghan mortgaged his Otsego tract of land to William Franklin, son of\r\nBenjamin, and lost it under foreclosure in 1773. This became the home of\r\nJames Fennimore Cooper, now Cooperstown, N. Y.\r\n\r\nIn the controversy between Pennsylvania and Virginia for the territory\r\nwhich lies west of the Laurel Hills, Croghan was a partisan of Virginia,\r\nand one of those who stirred up the most trouble.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the Revolution Colonel Croghan embarked in the\r\npatriot cause, being elected chairman of the Committee of Safety of\r\nAugusta County, May 16, 1775. He later became an object of suspicion.\r\n\r\nJune 15, 1778, he was declared by Pennsylvania a public enemy, and his\r\noffice of Indian Agent was conferred upon Colonel George Morgan. He\r\ncontinued, however, to reside in Pennsylvania, and died at Passyunk, in\r\nthe summer of 1782. His will is dated June 12, 1782.\r\n\r\nColonel Croghan married a Mohawk Indian, and their daughter, Catherine,\r\nbecame the third wife of Joseph Brant, the celebrated Mohawk chieftain\r\nof the Revolutionary period.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Pennsylvania Navy Meets British in Action,\r\n                              May 8, 1776\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Committee of Safety, which organized July 3, 1775, early in the\r\nfollowing year, had a survey made of the Delaware River, with a view to\r\nits more extensive fortification. Leave was obtained from New Jersey to\r\nconstruct works on that side of the river; a permanent fort was\r\ndetermined upon at Billingsport; the fort at Fort Island was hurried to\r\ncompletion; it was decided to fortify Liberty Island, and additions were\r\nmade to the chevaux-de-frise. To the naval flotilla were added the\r\nfloating battery Arnold, the ship-of-war Montgomery, the fireship Aetna\r\nand some guardboats for Philadelphia harbor. This naval force soon had a\r\nchance to show its mettle.\r\n\r\nOn May 6 news came to Philadelphia by express from Fort Penn that two\r\nwarships, a schooner and three tenders were coming up the river. The\r\nCommittee of Safety ordered the gunboat flotilla and the Montgomery and\r\nAetna, under command of Commodore Andrew Caldwell and Captain James\r\nReed, to attack the enemy. His vessels were the Roebuck, forty-eight\r\nguns, under command of Captain Hammond, and the sloop-of-war Liverpool,\r\ntwenty-eight guns, under command of Captain Bellew, and their tenders.\r\n\r\nCaptain Proctor, in command of the fort at Fort Island, volunteered for\r\nthe fight with 100 of his men and served on board the Hornet. The\r\nMontgomery, the Continental ship Reprisal, under command of Captain\r\nWickes, and the battery Arnold, under Captain Samuel Davidson, remained\r\nnear the chevaux-de-frise, in a line with the forts. The other boats\r\nwent down the river to the mouth of Christiana Creek, coming up with the\r\nenemy on the afternoon of May 8.\r\n\r\nFire was immediately opened on both sides and was maintained with much\r\nspirit until dark. The Roebuck ran ashore and careened; the Liverpool\r\ncame to anchor to protect her and the provincial boats withdrew to\r\nobtain more ammunition.\r\n\r\nDuring this engagement, the Continental schooner Wasp, with Captain\r\nAlexander, which had been previously chased into Wilmington, came out\r\nand captured an English brig belonging to the squadron. The fireship was\r\nnot brought into use, and before morning the Roebuck was again afloat.\r\n\r\nThe attack was renewed at 5 o’clock in the morning when the British\r\nships retired, being closely pursued as far as New Castle by the\r\nPhiladelphia navy.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the flotilla complained grievously of the supplies\r\nfurnished them by the Committee of Safety as being defective in quality\r\nand deficient in quantity; the powder was so bad that the men had to cut\r\nup their clothes and equipments to make the cartridges serviceable.\r\nThere were also other defects, so that the officers threw the whole\r\nblame of their failure to destroy or capture the enemy vessels upon the\r\ncommittee. The Assembly investigated, however, and exonerated the\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\nThe American loss was one killed and two wounded. The British lost one\r\nkilled and five wounded. So it was quite probable this engagement was\r\nfought at long range. Members of the Provincial Navy, however, brought\r\nup some splinters from the enemy’s ships to exhibit at the Coffee House\r\nas trophies of the fight. The Roebuck and the Liverpool returned to\r\ntheir stations at Cape May, depending upon New Jersey, instead of\r\nPennsylvania, for poultry and fresh provisions.\r\n\r\nThis engagement served a valuable purpose. Congress and the Provincial\r\nAssembly were certainly admonished to increase their navies. The\r\nCommittee of Safety added to the galleys and other vessels, sloops,\r\nschooners, guard boats and also firerafts. This added force was composed\r\nof 743 men. Samuel Davidson was appointed to succeed Commodore Caldwell,\r\nas commander of the flotilla, soon after the fight, but on account of\r\nmuch opposition from other officers, never took up the command.\r\n\r\nThe Committee of Safety organized a system of privateers and letters of\r\nmarque at this time, with the sanction of Congress. They created a Court\r\nof Admiralty, of which George Ross, of Lancaster, was judge; Matthew\r\nClarkson, marshal, and Andrew Robinson, register.\r\n\r\nBefore July there had also been commissioned the brigs Hancock and\r\nCongress, and the sloop Chance, under Captains Wingate Newman, John\r\nKaye, and James Robertson. As early as May the Congress and Chance had\r\ntaken three valuable ships from Jamaica bound for London, with large\r\ncargoes of rum, sugar and molasses, 22,420 “pieces of eight,” 187 ounces\r\nof plate and a fine turtle, intended as a present to Lord North. The\r\nPresident of the Continental Congress received and enjoyed this turtle.\r\n\r\nIt is also of interest to our Province to note that the activities of\r\nthe young navy resulted in other important prizes. The privateer\r\nCongress captured the schooner Thistle; the privateer Franklin, of\r\nPhiladelphia, took a British storeship with seventy-five tons of\r\ngunpowder and 1000 stands of arms; the ship Lexington, under Captain\r\nJohn Barry, of Philadelphia, captured the Edward; the Wasp took the\r\nschooner Betsy. In the meantime the British Roebuck and Liverpool, with\r\ntheir tenders, made many captures of vessels about the Delaware Capes,\r\nchasing others ashore. But the record of the young American Navy was\r\nglorious and certainly a fine beginning for the brilliant successes\r\nwhich were to follow.\r\n\r\nThus we find that the Committee of Safety constructed the Pennsylvania\r\nState Navy three months before Congress proposed a Continental navy.\r\n\r\nBy August, 1776, the fleet numbered twenty-seven vessels, with Captain\r\nThomas Reed as commodore, the first officer of that title in America.\r\nAnother distinguished officer was Nicholas Biddle.\r\n\r\nThree months after the State Navy was begun the Continental Congress\r\ntook action for the construction of a Continental navy, which was also\r\nfitted out in Philadelphia. When the Congress of the United States\r\nestablished the Navy Department in 1798, the first navy yard was located\r\nin Philadelphia, where ship building had been an established enterprise\r\nsince 1683. The city is today famous for the quality and quantity of\r\nships built for this and other nations of the world.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Bishop John Heyl Vincent, Founder of\r\n                      Chautauqua, Died May 9, 1920\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant once introduced Bishop J. H. Vincent to President Lincoln\r\nand said: “Dr. Vincent was my pastor at Galena (Illinois), and I do not\r\nthink I missed one of his sermons while I lived there.”\r\n\r\nThis same Bishop Vincent, of good old Pennsylvania stock and many years\r\na resident of Pennsylvania, was the founder of the Chautauqua Assembly,\r\nnext only to the public-school system in bringing to the masses of the\r\npeople some share of their inheritance in the world’s great creations in\r\nart and literature. This is the work of a man—a great teacher and\r\neducator and university preacher—who did not himself have a college\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nIn 1772 the Vincent family, consisting of John Vincent and wife, their\r\nsons, Cornelius and Peter; their sons-in-law, Timothy Williams and\r\nSamuel Gould, removed from Essex County, N. J., and settled in\r\nNorthumberland County, Pa., near the present town of Milton.\r\n\r\nWhen the Indians became hostile during the Revolutionary War the early\r\nsettlers along the West branch of the Susquehanna erected stockade forts\r\nat central points, into which the women and children of the neighborhood\r\nwere gathered for protection at the approach of danger. In one of these\r\nforts, known as Fort Freeland, situated on Warrior Run, were gathered\r\nthe Vincents, the Himrods, the Miles, the McKnights, the Boyds, the\r\nKings, the Littles and others.\r\n\r\nJune 21, 1779, a party of Indians approached stealthily and fired upon\r\nsix men hoeing corn in a field near the fort. They killed Isaac Vincent\r\nand James Miles and took Michael Freeland and Benjamin Vincent\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\nJuly 28, 1779, 200 British under Captain John McDonald and 300 Seneca\r\nIndians, under Chief Hiokatoo attacked the fort and compelled it to\r\ncapitulate, the conditions of surrender being that all the men over\r\nseventeen should become prisoners of war, and the women and children and\r\nthe aged should be set at liberty. Under this capitulation, Cornelius\r\nVincent and his sons, Daniel and Bethuel, with their neighbors, were\r\nmarched across the country to the Lakes, then to Quebec, where they\r\nremained prisoners till the close of the war.\r\n\r\nThe aged John Vincent and wife, with the wife and younger children of\r\nCornelius, wended their way back on foot to New Jersey and were\r\nscattered among their friends until the return of the captives.\r\n\r\nSoon after their return from captivity Cornelius Vincent and his wife\r\nand their sons, Daniel and Bethuel, returned to the West Branch Valley\r\nand resumed the settlement they had been obliged to abandon. Daniel\r\nbuilt and owned a large mill on Warrior Run. Bethuel built a large hotel\r\nin Milton, and became its most prominent citizen. Bethuel Vincent was\r\npostmaster at Milton, June 29, 1803 to February 22, 1822, and again July\r\n13, 1822 to June 23, 1829.\r\n\r\nCornelius Vincent died in Milton, July 16, 1812. Daniel Vincent died\r\nnear his mills, January 26, 1826, and Bethuel died at his home in\r\nMilton, April 30, 1837.\r\n\r\nBethuel Vincent, born June 3, 1762, married Martha Himrod, January 1,\r\n1788. They were the parents of nine children, of whom John Himrod, born\r\nApril 20, 1798, was the youngest of the four sons.\r\n\r\nJohn Himrod married Mary Raser, a native of Philadelphia, who died at\r\nChillisquaque, Pa., February 16, 1852. They were old-fashioned\r\nMethodists, and parents of Bishop Vincent.\r\n\r\nDuring a short residence in Tuscaloosa, Ala., John Heyl Vincent, the\r\nsubject of this sketch, was born February 23, 1832. The parents soon\r\nmoved back to their Pennsylvania home, where John H. attended the\r\nschools at Milton and Lewisburg. He began to preach at eighteen years\r\nand studied for awhile at Wesleyan Institute, Newark, N. J.\r\n\r\nReverend John Heyl Vincent joined the New Jersey Conference in 1853. Was\r\nordained deacon, 1855; elder, in 1857. Transferred to Rock River, Ill.\r\nConference, he became pastor at Galena in 1857, and General U. S. Grant\r\nwas one of his parishioners. He then preached elsewhere and in Chicago.\r\n\r\nA trip to the old world in 1862, contributed an important part to his\r\nintellectual training. He visited Egypt, Palestine, Greece, Italy and\r\nother countries.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 he was elected general agent of the Methodist Episcopal Sunday\r\nSchool Union and in 1868, corresponding secretary of the Sunday School\r\nUnion and Tract Society, with residence in New York City. A complete\r\nseries of his books forms an encyclopedia of modern Sunday School\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nThis work culminated in 1874, in the Chautauqua Sunday School Assembly,\r\nfrom which he founded, in 1878, the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific\r\nCircle and was its Chancellor until his death.\r\n\r\nHe was made resident bishop at Zurich, Switzerland, 1900, and placed in\r\ncharge of European work of the Methodist Church.\r\n\r\nBishop Vincent became preacher to Harvard, Yale, Cornell, Wellesley and\r\nother universities and colleges, and was the recipient of many honorary\r\ndegrees.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of his great work at Chautauqua he remarked: “I do not\r\nexpect to make a second Harvard and Yale out of Chautauqua, but I do\r\nwant to give the people of this generation such a taste of what it is to\r\nbe intelligent that they will see to it that their children have the\r\nbest education the country can give.”\r\n\r\nBishop Vincent died in Chicago, May 9, 1920, aged 88 years.\r\n\r\nBishop Vincent’s son, Hon. George Edgar Vincent, a distinguished\r\neducator and powerful orator, is president of the Rockefeller\r\nFoundation.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania may well be proud to claim the ancestors of Bishop Vincent,\r\nthe founder of Chautauqua, as their own.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Long Standing Boundary Line Dispute Between\r\n                Maryland and Pennsylvania Proprietaries\r\n                          Signed May 10, 1732\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the boundary dispute between Pennsylvania and Maryland Lord Baltimore\r\nhad observations taken of the latitude of New Castle, Delaware, which\r\nshowed that town to be 39° 39′ 30″, which would place the end of the\r\nfortieth degree many miles to the north, and its beginning far beyond\r\nthe reach of the radius of twelve miles as called for by Lord Chief\r\nJustice North, of England.\r\n\r\nA degree of latitude is a band about sixty-nine and a half miles wide,\r\nextending around the earth parallel to the equator.\r\n\r\nLord North, William Penn, Lord Baltimore, and others, in the absence of\r\nbetter knowledge, simply assumed that the degrees on the maps were all\r\ntoo far south, which was only a guess, but in fact they were nearly\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\nPenn obtained his charter and sent William Markham, his cousin and\r\ndeputy, to the Delaware to take an observation of the latitude, and he\r\nwas to meet Lord Baltimore, or his agents, and settle the boundaries.\r\n\r\nThis meeting was held in Upland, now Chester, in latter part of the year\r\n1681. The observation was taken, and it became manifest that an absurd\r\nmistake in latitude was revealed, and that the fortieth degree, the\r\nsouthern boundary of Pennsylvania was twelve miles farther to the North.\r\nLord Baltimore already knew that the end of the fortieth degree was many\r\nmiles north of its position on Captain John Smith’s map, and he renewed\r\nhis old claim that his province of Maryland extended to the fortieth\r\ndegree complete. Thus began the controversy which lasted twenty years.\r\n\r\nThis claim carried the northern boundary of Maryland far into Penn’s\r\nprovince, just north of Philadelphia, and if successfully defended would\r\nhave cut from the southern part of our State all the territory south of\r\na line running through Philadelphia, Dowingtown, just south of\r\nLancaster, and north of York, Bedford, Somerset, Connellsville,\r\nBrownsville, and the village of West Finley in Washington County.\r\n\r\nBut Penn had a strong case to defend his territorial limits, his charter\r\nexpressly defined the southern limit of Pennsylvania, as on the\r\nbeginning of the fortieth degree, which would make its southern limit\r\nreach nearly to the City of Washington, and would have cut off from Lord\r\nBaltimore’s province much more territory than he was trying to cut from\r\nPenn’s. Penn also possessed the later grant from the Crown, and in such\r\na dispute, where the limits overlapped, it would be taken to have\r\nannulled the older.\r\n\r\nPenn was willing to yield his stronger position and compromise, all he\r\ndemanded was that the line be placed where it was supposed to be when\r\nhis charter was granted. The mistake in latitude made Penn’s boundary on\r\nthe Delaware ridiculous, for the circle of twelve miles from New Castle\r\ncould not possibly touch the beginning of the fortieth degree, which was\r\nforty miles to the south of it.\r\n\r\nIt would have been unfortunate to obstruct the settlement of this\r\ncountry by putting claims in which both seemed to be justified, but Penn\r\ndid even more than expected. He offered to purchase from Baltimore\r\nsufficient land to give Pennsylvania a harbor at the head of the\r\nChesapeake. At another personal interview with Baltimore at West River\r\nhe suggested a compromise even more favorable to Maryland, by suggesting\r\nthat additional territory should be given Baltimore to make up the loss\r\nof the increased length of a degree, which was recently ascertained to\r\nbe 69½ instead of 60 miles. This would have placed the northern line of\r\nMaryland about seven miles north of the head of the Chesapeake.\r\n\r\nLord Baltimore refused all compromises offered by William Penn. He\r\nfancied he could obtain great acquisitions of territory, and was\r\ndetermined his province should consist of the present Maryland, Delaware\r\nand the southern strip of Pennsylvania above described.\r\n\r\nThe controversy was thrown in the privy council. The case was argued for\r\ntwo years, the council finally deciding that Baltimore’s charter did not\r\ngive him a title to Delaware, because at the time of granting the\r\ncharter that region had been in possession of the Dutch, and they\r\nordered Baltimore and Penn to divide Delaware equally between them by a\r\nnorth and south line, midway between the Chesapeake and the Delaware.\r\nThe decision of the council was confined to the controversy between\r\nDelaware and Maryland, and nothing was said about the disputed boundary\r\nof the 40° between Maryland and Pennsylvania and it remained unsettled.\r\n\r\nThis condition proved a great hardship, the inhabitants on the border,\r\nuncertain of their position, refused to pay taxes to either government,\r\nand the sheriffs of adjoining counties carried on a warfare of petty\r\nannoyance. This gave the rougher and lawless men an excuse for fighting.\r\nOne of the most notable of these was Thomas Cresap. He caused so much\r\ntrouble in the southern counties that when he was arrested and carried\r\nto Philadelphia, which he called a pretty Maryland town, his exploits\r\nwere known as the Cresap War.\r\n\r\nWilliam Penn died July 30, 1718, leaving the question as unsettled as it\r\nwas in 1682. Charles Calvert, the fifth Lord Baltimore, was now the\r\nproprietor of Maryland, and the first of the family to show much\r\ncleverness.\r\n\r\nHe went to Penn’s widow and admitted he had no just claim to the title\r\nof Delaware, and suggested that no more land should be granted near\r\neither of the disputed borders by either government for eighteen months,\r\nwithin which time they could settle all difficulties. This agreement was\r\nsigned in February, 1723, and long after the eighteen months had passed\r\ninto history, the agreement was faithfully observed by Hannah Penn, and\r\nafter her death by her children. Baltimore also observed it.\r\n\r\nWilliam Penn’s widow died in 1726, and her young sons did not\r\nimmediately mark the boundary, and Baltimore now assumed the role of an\r\ninjured person, and in 1731 petitioned the Crown to compel the\r\nProprietors of Pennsylvania to join with him in settling the boundaries.\r\nHe applied to John and Thomas Penn to meet with him and sign an\r\nagreement of settlement, which they agreed to do, and they also accepted\r\nthe terms proposed in it by Baltimore and the articles were signed May\r\n10, 1732.\r\n\r\nThe southern boundary of Pennsylvania was fixed about seven miles north\r\nof the head of Chesapeake, and the same as William Penn had offered\r\nBaltimore in their interview at West River. By this agreement Lord\r\nBaltimore received more than had ever belonged to him.\r\n\r\nA map was prepared, and attached to the agreement, on which the\r\nboundaries were plainly marked. This map was prepared by Baltimore, and\r\nthe Penns accepted it as correct.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Captain Stephen Chambers Fatally Wounded\r\n                  in Duel with Dr. Rieger May 11, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nIn May, 1789, there was a brilliant banquet given at the public house of\r\nColonel Mathias Slough, on the southeast corner of Penn Square and South\r\nQueen Street, Lancaster. This social function was attended by a large\r\nnumber of officers and soldiers who had fought in the Revolutionary War,\r\namong whom were Captain Stephen Chambers and Surgeon Jacob Rieger.\r\n\r\nCaptain Chambers was neatly dressed in his military uniform, and in\r\npersonal appearance was one of the finest-looking officers of that\r\nperiod. Dr. Rieger was quite the opposite, rather diminutive in stature,\r\nunshaven and otherwise very untidy.\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of the banquet Captain Chambers made some\r\ndisparaging remark about Dr. Rieger, which the latter overheard and\r\ndeemed insulting. The result was a challenge to a duel, which was as\r\npromptly accepted.\r\n\r\nThe parties immediately named their seconds, who fixed the following\r\nMonday evening, May 11, as the time. The parties met according to\r\narrangement on the outskirts of Lancaster, and after the necessary\r\ndetails were concluded the antagonists faced each other, and at the\r\ncommand of fire neither shot took effect. The seconds, at this point,\r\nmade an earnest effort to reconcile the principals, Captain Chambers and\r\nhis seconds being in a mood to offer such terms as they believed to be\r\nproper and satisfactory, but Dr. Rieger would not consent to any terms\r\nof reconciliation.\r\n\r\nThey took their places and on the command of fire Captain Chambers\r\nsnapped his pistol without discharging, but Dr. Rieger sent a ball\r\ncrashing through both legs of Captain Chambers. His wounds bled freely,\r\nand for two days it was thought they were not dangerous; mortification,\r\nhowever, set in and he died in great agony on Saturday morning\r\nfollowing, May 16.\r\n\r\nThus perished one of the noblest patriots and most brilliant legal minds\r\nof the bar, an event which agitated the public mind for years afterward\r\nas an unwarranted and cold-blooded murder.\r\n\r\nJudge John Joseph Henry married Chambers’ sister, Jane, and was the\r\nattorney for his executors.\r\n\r\nCaptain Chambers was a native of Ireland, being born there in 1750. He\r\ncame to Pennsylvania prior to the Revolution, and settled at Lancaster.\r\nHe studied law and as soon as he was admitted to practice in 1773, he\r\nremoved to Sunbury, where he became the first resident attorney of\r\nNorthumberland County. Fithian, in his journal under date July 20, 1775,\r\nmet him at Sunbury, “a lawyer, serious, civil and social.”\r\n\r\nAt the outset of the Revolution he entered the service. He was appointed\r\nfirst lieutenant of the Twelfth Regiment of the Continental Line,\r\nOctober 16, 1776, and promoted to captain in 1777.\r\n\r\nHe was chosen to the General Assembly from Northumberland County,\r\nOctober 2, 1778, and while in attendance thereon was admitted to the\r\nPhiladelphia bar, March 6, 1779. In 1779 he was a member of the\r\nRepublican Society of Philadelphia, whose object was the revision of the\r\nConstitution of 1776.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1780 he returned to his former home in Lancaster and soon\r\nattained a large and lucrative practice, owned several farms and also\r\nbecame interested in the iron business. He represented Lancaster County\r\nin the Council of Censors, 1783 and 1784. He also was one of the\r\noriginal members of the Pennsylvania Society of the Cincinnati.\r\n\r\nHe was a delegate to the convention November 29, 1787, which ratified,\r\non the part of Pennsylvania, the Federal Constitution. In the debate he\r\ntook a most aggressive part, frequently becoming very personal in his\r\nattack upon members of the opposite side, especially toward William\r\nFindlay. Captain Chambers voted with his comrades in arms, and on the\r\nside of the adoption of the Federal Constitution.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of interest that Captain Chambers was among the\r\ndistinguished patriots who were in the house of James Wilson, in\r\nPhiladelphia, when the mob made a disgraceful attack against it, October\r\n4, 1779. Captain Chambers appeared with James Wilson, and others, before\r\nSupreme Executive Council, October 19, 1779, and was bound over to\r\nappear at the next term of court, in the sum of £5000. George Clymer and\r\nSamuel Caldwell becoming his sureties in the sum of £2,500 each.\r\n\r\nThe evening of the day of the riot at “Fort Wilson,” Captain Chambers\r\nattended the Quarterly Communication of the Grand Lodge of Ancient York\r\nMasons and was installed Worshipful Master of Lodge No. 22, which was\r\nconstituted at Northumberland the following month.\r\n\r\nAt the constitution of Lodge No. 22, about the middle of November, 1779,\r\nChambers became its first Worshipful Master, and the warrant for that\r\nbody was produced and presented by him at “his own proper cost and\r\ncharges.”\r\n\r\nIn July, 1785, he became the warrant Worshipful Master of Lodge No. 43,\r\nat Lancaster, and both of these ancient lodges are still at labor, the\r\nformer, Lodge No. 22, now at Sunbury.\r\n\r\nDr. Joseph Rieger was the surgeon of the Pennsylvania Rifle Regiment,\r\ncommanded by Colonel Samuel Hiles. He was commissioned March 22, 1776.\r\nHe was a highly respected physician of Lancaster. He died there in 1795.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 War of 1812 Began in Pennsylvania with\r\n                       Message of Governor Snyder\r\n                              May 12, 1812\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the infant Nation believed that Great Britain had\r\nwantonly trampled on their rights, and on May 12, 1812, Governor Simon\r\nSnyder expressed the feelings of the people in his call for\r\nPennsylvania’s quota of 14,000 militia, when he stated that for thirty\r\nyears we had lived at peace with all the nations of the earth, while the\r\nstorm of war had been desolating many countries of the civilized world,\r\nand that all means which wisdom and patience could devise had been in\r\nvain resorted to in the hope of preserving peace.\r\n\r\n“The cup of patience, of humiliation and long suffering,” declared the\r\nGovernor, “had been filled to overflowing; and the indignant arm of an\r\ninjured people must be raised to dash it to the earth and grasp the\r\navenging sword. If ever a nation had justifiable cause for war, that\r\nnation is the United States. If ever a people had motives to fight, we\r\nare that people. It would give the Governor inexpressible satisfaction\r\nif Pennsylvania would volunteer her quota.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the enthusiasm of the hour that in response to the Governor’s\r\ncall three times as many troops tendered their services as were\r\nrequired. The disappointment of some was so great that money was freely\r\noffered to secure a place among those accepted by the authorities.\r\n\r\nGeneral William Reed, the Adjutant General of the State, speedily\r\norganized this force, which was formed into two divisions, four brigades\r\nand twenty-two regiments. The first, or Philadelphia division, was\r\ncommanded by Major General Isaac Morrell and the second, from Pittsburgh\r\nand vicinity, by Major General Adamson Tannehill.\r\n\r\nThe differences which had so long existed between the United States and\r\nGreat Britain finally resulted in war, which was declared by Congress\r\nJune 18, 1812. Every Representative, but two from Pennsylvania and both\r\nthe Senators, voted in favor of a declaration and the people at home\r\nproved in demonstrative terms that they approved their vote.\r\n\r\nIn July a general alarm prevailed in Erie and vicinity, in consequence\r\nof the appearance of a British-Indian force on the opposite side of the\r\nlake.\r\n\r\nOn July 15 the sixteenth division of Pennsylvania militia was organized\r\nunder General Kelso. Four thousand men called for by the President\r\nrendezvoused at Meadville and Pittsburgh looking to a movement on\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nSoon the 2000 men at Meadville were ordered to Western New York, where\r\nthey participated in the battles along the Canadian border. After the\r\nunsuccessful efforts of General Dearborn and Wilkinson, the rank of\r\nmajor general was conferred upon Jacob Brown, of Bucks County, and he\r\nwas given the command of the Northern Department.\r\n\r\nGeneral Brown at Ogdensburg, October 4, 1812, defeated the British, and\r\nwon a signal victory, May 29, when he took Sackett’s Harbor, which he\r\nretained until the close of the war. General Brown also won a brilliant\r\nvictory at Fort Erie, which is on the Canadian shore, opposite Buffalo,\r\nN. Y., on July 3, 1814.\r\n\r\nWinfield Scott, later the successful commander in the war with Mexico,\r\nwas an officer under General Brown. He won the brilliant and important\r\nengagement at Chippewa, under directions of General Brown. Captain\r\nThomas Biddle, of Philadelphia, commanded one of the three batteries of\r\nartillery engaged.\r\n\r\nGeneral Brown then won the severe battle of Lundy’s Lane, July 25, in\r\nwhich 2600 Americans defeated 7000 British, and captured one of their\r\nbatteries. In this engagement General Brown was twice wounded, Major\r\nDaniel McFarland was killed, Captain Biddle and Colonel Hugh Brady, of\r\nNorthumberland County, afterward a distinguished general of the United\r\nStates Army, were severely wounded.\r\n\r\nGeneral Brown defended Fort Erie against two attacks and at the close of\r\nthe campaign was honored by the State of New York with a gift of gold\r\nand a decorated sword, “in testimony of the high sense they entertained\r\nof his valor and skill in defeating the British forces, superior in\r\nnumber.” Congress gave him the thanks of the Nation and a gold medal,\r\nand he was made Commander-in-Chief of the armies of the United States.\r\nHe died February 24, 1828, from the effects of wounds received at\r\nLundy’s Lane.\r\n\r\nOther Pennsylvanians who were heroes in this war included General Thomas\r\nBodley and Colonel William Carroll, a native of Pittsburgh, who\r\nafterward served as Governor of Tennessee from 1821 to 1827, and again\r\nfrom 1830 to 1835.\r\n\r\nThe defense of Philadelphia was chiefly maintained by volunteers from\r\nPennsylvania. One camp was established at Shell Pot, north of\r\nWilmington, where the “Philadelphia Blues” under Captain Lewis Rush\r\nformed a part of the command. He was promoted and Lieutenant Henry Myers\r\nsucceeded him as captain of the Blues, or “Bucktails,” as they were more\r\ngenerally called.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1814, Governor Snyder ordered out troops to serve for\r\nthe defense of Delaware and the Elk River. A camp was established near\r\nWilmington, called Camp Dupont, and was under the command of General\r\nThomas Cadwalader, of Philadelphia. The infantry regiment was commanded\r\nby Colonel Clement C. Biddle, and a battalion of artillery was there\r\nunder command of Colonel Prevost. Another camp was formed near Marcus\r\nHook, called Camp Gaines. General Snyder commanded this brigade. In this\r\ncamp were Colonel William Duane and others. The First or old “City\r\nTroop,” commanded then by Captain Charles Ross, was in Camp Gaines.\r\n\r\nAnother camp of 5000 troops was established at York under Major General\r\nNathaniel Watson. When General Ross attempted the capture of Baltimore\r\nthese Pennsylvanians marched there and aided in repelling the enemy.\r\n\r\nAn important event of this war was the blockade of the Delaware River in\r\nMarch, 1813, by the British fleet under Commodore Sir John P. Beresford.\r\n\r\nThe closing scenes of the war were enacted in the regions north and\r\nsouth of Pennsylvania, and the State was not seriously threatened with\r\ninvasion.\r\n\r\nOn August 24, 1814, Washington fell into the enemy’s hands, the city\r\npillaged and the Capitol burned.\r\n\r\nJust as Robert Morris was the financier of the Revolution, so Stephen\r\nGirard also of Philadelphia, was the financier of the War of 1812. The\r\nGovernment needed $5,000,000 and offered high interest, but only\r\n$200,000 was subscribed, when Girard stepped into the scene and\r\nsubscribed the balance. He staked his whole fortune in his trust of his\r\nadopted country, which none other would do, and saved the Nation from a\r\nhumiliating defeat. He also took Treasury bills at their face value, and\r\nhis example shamed other creditors, who then accepted the money of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          Lieutenant Colonel Antes, Soldier and Frontiersman,\r\n                           Died May 13, 1820\r\n\r\n\r\nLieutenant Colonel John Henry Antes died at his stockaded home, long\r\nknown as Antes’ Fort, May 13, 1820, aged eighty-three years.\r\n\r\nThis pioneer statesman and soldier was an early settler on the frontier\r\nof Pennsylvania, a member of a distinguished family in the Province, an\r\nofficer of the Revolution, Sheriff of Northumberland County during the\r\nstirring days of the Wyoming controversy, and an ardent patriot whose\r\ninfluence, both in civic and military affairs, was most potent a century\r\nand a quarter since.\r\n\r\nThe ancestral home of Colonel Antes was in the beautiful and fertile\r\nvalley, called Falkner’s Swamp, in what is now Montgomery County, about\r\nsix miles from Pottstown.\r\n\r\nPhilip Frederick Antes, grandfather of Lieutenant Colonel John Henry\r\nAntes, of the noble family of Von Blume, of Rhenish Bavaria, Germany,\r\nowing to religious persecutions, came from Friensheim, Germany, sometime\r\nbetween 1716 and 1723, and settled for a short time in Germantown.\r\n\r\nOn February 29, 1722–23, he bought 154 acres in the Van Bebber tract in\r\nwhat has since been called Falkner’s Swamp. This was a tract of 500\r\nacres in the original patent made by William Penn, October 25, 1701, to\r\nthe Frankford Land Company, and comprised 22,337 acres of the most\r\nfertile land in the State.\r\n\r\nOn December 16, 1708, the tract was sold by the agent, Daniel Falkner,\r\nto John Henry Sprogel for £500, current money of Pennsylvania and was\r\npaid for in “Silver Coyne.” This was known as the German tract and also\r\nby other names.\r\n\r\nIn 1726 Henry Antes, the only son, married Christina, the daughter of\r\nWilliam Dewees, who built the second paper mill in America, in 1710, in\r\nthat part of Germantown known as Crefeld, near the line of the present\r\nMontgomery County. A flour mill was added to the Crefeld paper mill and\r\nhere Henry Antes worked for three years. This was the birthplace of\r\nthree of their children, Frederick, William and Elizabeth. Henry Antes\r\nserved for more than ten years as one of the Justices of the Province.\r\n\r\nSeptember 2, 1735, Henry Antes purchased more than 200 acres about two\r\nmiles away, just across the line from the German tract, in what is now\r\nFrederick Township, Montgomery County, and built a grist mill and a\r\nstone mansion, in which the rest of his distinguished family was born,\r\nand which was destined to become one of the valued historic buildings of\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nIt was in this home that Lieutenant Colonel John Henry Antes was born,\r\nOctober 5, 1736. Here Reverend George Whitefield, the great evangelist,\r\npreached from the porch, April 23, 1740, to a multitude estimated at\r\n3000 persons.\r\n\r\nIn 1745 Pious Henry Antes gave up his home to the needs of the Moravian\r\nSociety, and his house became the school for boys. He and his wife\r\nremoved to Bethlehem. Henry Antes’ home thus became the first boarding\r\nschool for boys in America.\r\n\r\nIt was in this mansion, then owned by Colonel Frederic Antes, that\r\nGeneral Washington made his headquarters, September 18 to 24, 1777,\r\nduring his stay at Camp Pottsgrove, the most westerly point ever reached\r\nby the Continental Army.\r\n\r\nWhen still quite a young man John Henry Antes, being of a romantic\r\ndisposition, went to the Susquehanna region, being induced to do so by\r\nConrad Weiser, who was a great friend of the family, and who had made\r\nfrequent trips to the West Branch in the interest of the Provincial\r\nGovernment. He settled on a farm situated on Shamokin Creek, near the\r\npresent Sunbury, and soon became one of the prominent men of that\r\nregion.\r\n\r\nOn July 29, 1775, he was appointed a Justice of Quarter Sessions. On\r\nJanuary 24, 1776, he was commissioned a captain in the Second Battalion,\r\nunder Colonel James Potter, and on March 13, following was assigned to\r\nthe command of Colonel William Plunket, when he made his expedition\r\nagainst the Connecticut settlers; then Captain Antes was assigned to the\r\nSecond Battalion of Associators.\r\n\r\nOn May 21, 1777, he was commissioned lieutenant colonel of the Fourth\r\nBattalion, of Northumberland County Militia, and in this service\r\nendeared himself to the frontier inhabitants by his active work in\r\nprotecting the settlements from the frequent incursions of the Indians.\r\n\r\nHe established his headquarters in the Nippenose Valley. Here he built\r\nthe stockade, called Antes’ Fort, which was the most exposed place on\r\nthe frontier. This stockade and the cabin home of Colonel Antes were\r\ndestroyed by the Tories and Indians at the time of the “Great Runaway,”\r\nJuly, 1778.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the Revolution, Colonel Antes was elected Sheriff\r\nof Northumberland County, October 18, 1782, and re-elected. At this time\r\nhis jurisdiction extended over what is now thirty counties of\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\nAt the close of his political and military career, he removed from his\r\nfarm to a tract of land on Nippenose Creek, which he had purchased\r\nSeptember 29, 1773. This site was near the mouth of that creek opposite\r\nthe mouth of Pine Creek, near the present Jersey Shore, and here he\r\nbuilt a mill, known as Antes’ Fort. His log mansion built at the same\r\ntime, 1785, which he stockaded, and which was later occupied by his son,\r\nHenry, until 1830, is still in use. The grist mill, now in operation, is\r\nthe fourth one erected on the original site.\r\n\r\nA gap in the mountains, a small town, and other places have taken their\r\nname from this sturdy pioneer.\r\n\r\nThe Antes Burying Ground is not far distant from the home and mill site,\r\nand in it is the grave of Colonel John Henry Antes.\r\n\r\nThe numerous descendants of Colonel Antes meet in annual reunion and\r\nrecount his many exploits and services so unselfishly rendered in time\r\nof need.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Provincial Council Hears of Border Trouble\r\n                              May 14, 1734\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas and John Penn, the Proprietaries, arrived in the Province, the\r\nformer in 1732, and his elder brother, John, two years later. They were\r\ncordially and affectionately received by the colonists as the sons of\r\nthe most illustrious founder.\r\n\r\nJohn Penn remained only one year, as he hurried back to England to\r\noppose the pretensions of Lord Baltimore, but Thomas Penn remained for\r\nsome years in the Province, spending his time generally after the manner\r\nof an English country gentleman. He was cold and distant in his\r\nintercourse with society and consequently unpopular. He returned to\r\nEngland in 1741.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1733 the Provincial Government for the first time became\r\napprehensive of the designs of the French in the Western country, where\r\nthey began to establish trading posts along the headwaters of the\r\nAllegheny and Ohio Rivers and claimed all the land on those waters by\r\nvirtue of some treaty of which the Provincial Government was not\r\napprised.\r\n\r\nWith a view to frustrate their designs, which obviously tended to\r\nalienate the Indians from the English, James Logan proposed that a\r\ntreaty should be made with the Shawnee and other tribes, and that they\r\nshould be invited to remove nearer the English settlements. In accord\r\nwith this suggestion, a treaty was held with the Six Nations at\r\nPhiladelphia, when the savages confirmed the fears of the English by\r\nadvising them of the French designs, and they promised perpetual\r\nfriendship with the English.\r\n\r\nThen trouble began on the Maryland border. At a meeting of Council held\r\nin Philadelphia May 14, 1734, Thomas Penn informed the board of some\r\nvery unneighborly proceedings of the Province of Maryland in not only\r\nharassing some of the inhabitants of this Province who lived along the\r\nborder, but that they extended their claims much farther than they had\r\never before pretended they had a right. They went so far as to carry off\r\nseveral persons, whom they imprisoned, among them being John Hendricks\r\nand Joshua Minshall, who lived on the Susquehanna in what is now York\r\nCounty. At the time of this report they were still confined in prison at\r\nAnnapolis.\r\n\r\nPenn advised Council he had engaged Andrew Hamilton, Esq., to appear for\r\nthem when they should be brought to trial at the ensuing Provincial\r\nCourt of Maryland. Penn said this action of the Marylanders made\r\nsettlements along the border insecure and he proposed that the Council\r\ndecide on measures for maintaining the peace between his Majesty’s\r\nsubjects in both Provinces.\r\n\r\nMr. Hamilton, accompanied by Mr. Georges, private secretary to Governor\r\nThomas Penn, went to Annapolis on their mission. They were also acting\r\nin capacity of commissioners for the Proprietaries, with the approval of\r\nthe Assembly, to execute articles of agreement, and to run, mark and lay\r\nout the lines, limits and boundaries between the two Provinces. They did\r\nnot meet with much success, in consequence of which, the Governor, under\r\ndate of August 19, 1734, wrote to the Justices of the Counties of\r\nChester, Lancaster on the Susquehanna, and New Castle, Kent and Sussex\r\non the Delaware as follows:\r\n\r\n“You are not, I believe, insensible how much the whole country has been\r\ndisappointed in the just hopes which had been entertained of seeing a\r\nfinal period put to those long pending disputes between this Government\r\nand that of Maryland, touching their respective boundaries, by the\r\nexecution of the solemn agreement concluded between the Proprietaries of\r\neach. It is, however, no small satisfaction to me that I can now\r\nacquaint you that this agreement, with the proceedings of the\r\ncommissioners thereon, having been laid before his Majesty’s attorney\r\nand solicitor general, we have had the pleasure of lately receiving the\r\nopinion, that the agreement still remains valid and binding, on both\r\nProprietaries, although their commissioners, by reason of difference in\r\nsentiments, have not carried into execution.\r\n\r\n“Now, as the northern bounds, formerly set by Lord Baltimore to himself,\r\ndiffer not much from those lately agreed upon, I know not how we can\r\njudge better or with more certainty of any bounds by which we limit our\r\npresent jurisdiction than near the place where it is known they will\r\nfall when the lines shall be actually run.\r\n\r\n“In the meantime, that a stop may be put to any further insults on the\r\npeople of this Government, and encroachments on lands within the bounds\r\nof the same, I am again to renew to you those pressing instances I have\r\nrepeatedly made, that agreeable to the duty of your stations, you exert\r\nyour utmost endeavors for preserving peace throughout your county, and\r\nprotecting all the inhabitants in the just and right possessions, in\r\nlegal and necessary defense of which every person ought to be encouraged\r\nto appear with boldness, and to be assured of receiving all the\r\ncountenance that lawful authority can give.\r\n\r\n“And as the late disturbances have been in a great measure owing to the\r\nunjust attempts of those who, pretending right to, or claiming disputed\r\nlands, under that pretense, have come many miles into this Province, and\r\nwith force possessed themselves of lands for which they can have no\r\nlawful grant from any other persons but our Honorable Proprietaries\r\nonly, and have likewise committed very great violences upon sundry of\r\nour inhabitants, you are to give strict orders for apprehending and\r\nsecuring all such who have been principals or accessories therein, as\r\nwell as those who hereafter shall presume to offer an injury to the\r\npersons or professions of his Majesty’s peaceable subjects or encroach\r\non any lands within the known and reputed limits of your county, that\r\nthey may be brought to condign punishment.\r\n\r\n“But as in the year 1724, it was agreed ‘that for avoiding all manner of\r\ncontention or difference between the inhabitants of the two Provinces,\r\nno person or persons should be disturbed or molested in their\r\npossessions they then held on either side,’ you are desired still to\r\nhave a particular regard to those entitled to the benefit of that\r\nagreement, while they behave themselves peaceably.”\r\n\r\nThe letters then gave implicit instructions to the sheriffs, directing\r\nthem to frequently visit the borders, particularly where the\r\ndisturbances happened, and give all assistance possible to the injured\r\nand apprehend those who caused the trouble and seize and secure them.\r\n\r\nIt was particularly fortunate that the Indians continued to live\r\namicably with the settlers at this period.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Dr. Nicholas More, First Chief Justice,\r\n                         Impeached May 15, 1685\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Penn appointed his cousin, Captain William Markham, Deputy\r\nGovernor, and he arrived in the Province in October, 1681. He then\r\nappointed commissioners to lay out the proposed great city, who came\r\nover toward the end of that year. The commissioners, as originally\r\nappointed were William Crispin, Nathaniel Allen and John Bezar.\r\n\r\nThese commissioners sailed in the ship John and Sarah, taking the\r\nsouthern passage and stopping at Barbadoes, where Crispin died. Crispin\r\nwas head of the commission, a man of mature years and Penn’s own\r\nkinsman, like Markham.\r\n\r\nIt appears by a letter from Penn to Markham, dated London, October 18,\r\n1681, that Penn intended Crispin to hold high office in the new\r\nprovince. He says:\r\n\r\n“I have sent my cosen, William Crispen, to be thy assistant, as my\r\ncommission will appear. His Skill, experience, Industry and Integrity\r\nare well known to me, and particularly in Court keeping &c., so yt is my\r\nwill and pleasure that he be as Chief Justice to keep ye Seal, ye Courts\r\nand Sessions, & he shall be accountable to me for it.”\r\n\r\nThe honor, therefore, of discharging the highest judicial office in\r\nPennsylvania is to be attributed to the man appointed by the proprietary\r\nin pursuance of the act of 1684—that man was Dr. Nicholas More.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to understand the abilities and character of More. He\r\nwas educated in medicine, but drifted away, in his mature years, from\r\nthe practice of his profession, and in 1681 became the president of the\r\nSociety of Free Traders, and a large purchaser of land in the new\r\nProvince of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nNicholas More arrived in the province with Penn in 1682, and though not\r\na member of the Society of Friends, he so far won their confidence that\r\nhe was returned a member of the first Assembly at Chester, and probably\r\nwas the speaker of that body. He continued a member for three years, and\r\nin 1684 was again elected its speaker.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1684, he was commissioned Chief Justice by the Proprietary\r\nand at once entered upon the discharge of the functions of that high\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the estimable qualities which entitled him to these honors,\r\nhis character was stained with faults, and his haughty demeanor, harsh\r\nand ungoverned temper, incensed those with whom he was brought in\r\ncontact.\r\n\r\nIn 1683 a Council and Assembly attempted to function with less members\r\nthan required by the Frame of Government. More reminded them they had\r\nbroken the Charter and their acts would amount to nothing. He further\r\nsaid: “Hundreds in England will curse you * * * and their children after\r\nthem, and you may be impeached for treason for what you do.”\r\n\r\nHe denounced them when they passed laws which he opposed, and used\r\nlanguage which was not in common usage among the pious Quakers.\r\n\r\nThese practices and his overbearing and haughty spirit made More many\r\nenemies in all classes. It is therefore with but little surprise that\r\nthe Assembly formally impeached him early in his judicial career.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of May 15, 1685, a member of the House presented a formal\r\ncomplaint. More, who was sitting as a delegate, was ordered to withdraw.\r\nThe articles of accusation were read and approved, and a committee named\r\nto conduct the impeachment. But the Council received the accusers with\r\ngrave civility and gave the Judge until 7 o’clock the following morning\r\nto answer the charges.\r\n\r\nMore was not inclined to gracefully submit himself to the judgment of\r\nthe Council and bitterly accused Abraham Mann as “a person of a\r\nseditious spirit.” He did not appear before Council and also refused to\r\nattend when warned by a committee.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly prudently resolved to collect the testimony necessary to\r\nmake good their charges. They required the records of the Provincial\r\nCourt, which were in possession of Patrick Robinson, clerk of the Court,\r\nwho happened to be present in the House. He was little in sympathy with\r\nthe impeachment and refused to produce the desired records. He even\r\nalleged that the records were “written in Latin where one word stood for\r\na sentence and in unintelligible characters which no person could read\r\nbut himself; no, not an angel from Heaven.”\r\n\r\nThe clerk held firm and then withdrew from the House. A warrant was\r\nissued by the Speaker and he was placed in the custody of the sheriff.\r\n\r\nMore all this time, secretly supported by the Governor and his friends\r\nin the Council, took no notice of the proceedings against him. He told\r\nJohn Briggs, a member of the House, “Either I myself or some of you will\r\nbe hanged and I advise you to enter your protest against it.”\r\n\r\nOn the morning of May 18 the Assembly met after a long conference with\r\nthe Council. They once more endeavored to extort the records from\r\nRobinson, who was brought into the House in the custody of the Sheriff,\r\nbut in vain. Robinson threw himself on the floor and refused to arise or\r\nanswer any questions put to him. The House, therefore, hastened to make\r\nan end of the business. They expelled More, resolved to ask that\r\nRobinson should be removed from office, hastily gathered together their\r\nevidence, and presented themselves before the Council.\r\n\r\nMore again absented himself, but the evidence against him was\r\nsufficiently serious. He was proved to have acted in a summary and\r\nunlawful way in summoning juries; to have perverted the sense of the\r\ntestimony; to have unduly harassed a jury into finding an unjust\r\nverdict, etc., and finally of having used “several contemptuous and\r\nderogatory expressions ... of the Provincial Council and of the present\r\nstate of Government by calling the members thereof fooles and\r\nloggerheads,” and by saying “it was well if all the laws had dropt and\r\nthat it never would be good times as long as ye Quakers had ye\r\nadministration.”\r\n\r\nThe speaker requested that both More and Robinson be dismissed from\r\noffice, and the Assembly withdrew.\r\n\r\nThe Governor and Council were puzzled how to act. Robinson was retained\r\nuntil he became so insolent that he was dismissed. But More had incurred\r\nthe displeasure of public opinion, yet they could not proceed against\r\nhim. The further prosecution of his case was postponed month by month by\r\ntrivial excuses, till more important matters took its place in the\r\npublic mind.\r\n\r\nIt is reasonable to conclude that Judge More must have been possessed of\r\nsome sterling qualities and considerable natural parts to warrant Penn\r\nin his appointment. His dismissal from office ended his career as a\r\npublic man.\r\n\r\nDr. More was the founder of the Manor of Moreland. He died after a\r\nlanguishing illness in 1689.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Massacre at French Jacob Groshong’s in\r\n                       Union County, May 16, 1780\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1780 occurred an Indian massacre at what was then known\r\nas French Jacob’s Mill. The site of this fatal attack is on a farm long\r\nin the possession of the Wohlheiter family, situated about one-half a\r\nmile southeast of the Forest House, at the end of Brush Valley Narrows,\r\nin what is now Union County.\r\n\r\nHere in 1776 Jacob Groshong, or French Jacob, as he was called by his\r\nneighbors, built a log mill, which was patronized by the settlers for\r\nmany miles around.\r\n\r\nOn May 16, 1780, a patrol of Continental soldiers on duty as a garrison\r\nat the mill, was attacked by a party of Indians, and four of the\r\ndefenders were killed and several wounded. Those killed were John\r\nFoster, James Chambers, George Etzweiler and Samuel McLaughlin.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers were outside the mill at the time of the attack washing\r\nthemselves. They had just returned from patroling that neighborhood and\r\nwere confident the immediate country was free of redskins.\r\n\r\nChristian Shively heard the firing as he was threshing grain in a field.\r\nHe immediately concealed his wife and two small children near the creek,\r\nthen rolled some logs into the stream and tied them into a raft, put his\r\nwife and children on, and floated down stream to safety. Henry Pontius,\r\na neighbor, also heard the shots, secured his gun, hurriedly mounted a\r\nhorse and made a circuit through the woods, and came to the mill just in\r\ntime to see the Indians fleeing with their plunder.\r\n\r\nAn appeal for assistance was sent to the seat of Government, and the\r\nfollowing day messengers set off for Philadelphia. A detail started for\r\nNew Berlin, bearing the bodies of the murdered soldiers, but when John\r\nClark’s farm was reached the party was divided. Those carrying the\r\nbodies of John Foster and James Chambers were compelled to make burial\r\nin the Lewis graveyard, as the weather was too excessively hot. The\r\nother party, bearing the body of George Etzweiler, buried it on the farm\r\nof John Brook, where his grave was suitably marked. The body of Samuel\r\nMcLaughlin was carried to New Berlin and buried in the Dry Run Cemetery.\r\n\r\nColonel Matthew Smith sent a letter to General Joseph Reed, president of\r\nthe State, dated Northumberland, May 18, 1780, in which he complained\r\nbitterly of the defenseless frontiers, and begged for immediate\r\nassistance. He said:\r\n\r\n“Sir, unless some support can be instantly afforded, the State must\r\nshortly count one county less than formerly—which God forbid. I refer\r\nyou, Dear Sir, to the bearer, General Potter, for further information,\r\nas he waits on horseback, whilst I write this imperfect, distressed\r\naccount. Provisions none; cash none, nor can it be had in this place.\r\nGeneral Potter’s account from this place to the Honorable Assembly,\r\nwhich I doubt not you will see, will fully satisfy you of the state of\r\nthis place.”\r\n\r\nThis mill, where the Indian fight occurred, was a favorite place for\r\nvisitors as long as it stood.\r\n\r\nSome time between 1776 and 1779 Jacob Groshong built a little log mill\r\non a site long afterward known as Solomon Heberling’s. He thought he had\r\na clear title to the location, but he was defeated in a law suit for\r\npossession.\r\n\r\nGroshong later moved up into the Nittany Mountain, in now Center County,\r\nand then went West. His name, or rather his nickname, is still preserved\r\nin connection with a rather large spring a little above the tavern, on\r\nthe Bush Valley road. He is the hero of many of the wild tales of Indian\r\ntroubles in that part of the valley.\r\n\r\nOn July 14, following this attack at French Jacob’s, the Indians\r\nattacked the family of Allens living at the mouth of Buffalo Creek, now\r\nLewisburg. The woman succeeded in making her escape across the creek,\r\nbut the husband and three children were killed.\r\n\r\nThe same day Baltzer Klinesmith was killed and his two daughters,\r\nElizabeth and Catherine, were carried off. This was in the vicinity of\r\nthe present Dreisbach Church, Union County.\r\n\r\nThe Indians and their prisoners arrived at a spring north of New Berlin,\r\nwhere they left the girls in charge of an old Indian and went down Dry\r\nValley. It soon began to rain and the Indian made the girls gather brush\r\nto cover a bag of flour they had stolen. He laid down under a tree with\r\nhis tomahawk under his head. The girls, passing with brush, gradually\r\nworked it from under him as he slept. Elizabeth secured it and motioned\r\nto her sister to run. She then sank it into the old Indian’s head and\r\nmade her escape.\r\n\r\nThe Indians returned about this time and pursued the girls, reaching\r\nthem when they neared the house. A rifle ball passed through Catherine’s\r\nshoulder, which maimed her for life, but the girls succeeded in reaching\r\ntheir home and the men, already alarmed and prepared, gave chase to the\r\nsavages.\r\n\r\nTwo days after these attacks Colonel John Kelly enrolled a company of\r\nNorthumberland County militia, with James Thompson as captain; Joseph\r\nPoak, lieutenant, and Alexander Ewing, ensign.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Indian War Known as Pontiac Conspiracy\r\n                          Opened May 17, 1763\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral John Forbes and his invincible army invested the ruins of Fort\r\nDuquesne, November 24, 1758. There was no attempt made to restore the\r\nold fortification, but about one year later work was begun on a new\r\nfort, under the personal direction of General John Stanwix, who\r\nsucceeded General Forbes, which has since been known as Fort Pitt.\r\n\r\nIt was built near the point where the Allegheny and Monongahela unite\r\ntheir waters, but a little farther inland than the site of Fort\r\nDuquesne. The exact date of its completion is not known, but on March\r\n21, 1760, Major General Stanwix, having finished his work, set out on\r\nhis return journey to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this stronghold was soon apparent in the return of about\r\n4000 settlers to their lands on the frontiers of Pennsylvania, Maryland\r\nand Virginia, from which they had been driven by their savage enemies,\r\nand the brisk trade which at once began to be carried on with the now,\r\nto all appearance, friendly Indians. However, this security was not of\r\nlong duration. The definite treaty of peace between England, Spain and\r\nFrance was signed February 10, 1763, but before that time, Pontiac, the\r\ngreat chief of the Ottawas, was planning his conspiracy, which carried\r\ndeath and desolation throughout the frontier.\r\n\r\nThe French had always tried to ingratiate themselves with the Indians.\r\nWhen their warriors came to the French forts they were hospitably\r\nwelcomed and liberally supplied with guns, ammunition and clothing. The\r\nEnglish, on the contrary, either gave reluctantly or did not give at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nIn a spirit of revenge and hatred a powerful confederacy was formed\r\nwhich included all the Western tribes, under the command of Pontiac,\r\nalike renowned for his warlike spirit, his wisdom and his bravery, and\r\nwhose name was a terror to the entire region of the lakes. The blow was\r\nto be struck the middle of May, 1763. The tribes were to rise\r\nsimultaneously and attack the English garrisons. Thus a sudden attack\r\nwas made May 17, on all Western posts.\r\n\r\nDetroit was saved after a long and close siege. Forts Pitt and Niagara\r\nnarrowly escaped, while Le Boeuff, Venango, Presque Isle, Miami, St.\r\nJoseph, Ouachtown, Sandusky, and Michillimackimac all fell into the\r\nhands of the savages. Their garrisons were either butchered on the spot,\r\nor carried off to be tortured for the amusement of their cruel captors.\r\n\r\nThe Indians swept over the surrounding country, carrying death and\r\ndestruction wherever they went. Hundreds of traders were slaughtered\r\nwithout mercy, while their wives and children, if not murdered, were\r\ncarried off captives. The property destroyed or stolen amounted, it is\r\nsaid, to five hundred thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nAttacks were made at Forts Bedford and Ligonier, but without success.\r\nFort Ligonier was under siege for two months. The preservation of this\r\npost was of the utmost importance, and Lieutenant Blaine, by his courage\r\nand good conduct, managed to hold out until August 2, 1763, when Colonel\r\nHenry Bouquet arrived with his little army to relieve him.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, every preparation was made at Fort Pitt for an attack.\r\nThe garrison at that post numbered 330, commanded by Captain Simeon\r\nEcuyer, a brave Swiss. The fortifications were repaired, barracks were\r\nmade shot-proof and a rude fire-engine was constructed to extinguish any\r\nflames kindled by the fire arrows of the Indians. All the houses and\r\ncabins outside the walls were leveled to the ground. The fort was\r\ncrowded with the families of the settlers.\r\n\r\nSeveral weeks elapsed before there was any determined attack from the\r\nenemy. Only July 26 some chiefs asked for a parley with Captain Ecuyer,\r\nwhich was granted. They demanded that he and all in the fort should\r\nleave it immediately or it and they would all be destroyed.\r\n\r\nOn the night succeeding this parley the Indians approached in great\r\nnumbers, crawling under the banks of the two rivers, in which they were\r\ncompletely sheltered from the fire of the fort. On the one side the\r\nentire bank was lined with the burrows, from which they shot volleys of\r\nbullets, arrows and fire-arrows into the fort. The yelling was terrific,\r\nand the women and children in the crowded barracks clung to each other\r\nin abject terror. This attack lasted for five days. On August 1, the\r\nIndians heard the rumor that Colonel Bouquet was approaching with a\r\nlarge force of troops, which caused them to give up the attack and move\r\noff, thus relieving the garrison.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of this sudden Indian uprising reached General Amherst he\r\nordered Colonel Bouquet to march with a detachment of 500 men to the\r\nrelief of the besieged forts. This force was composed of regulars and\r\nsix companies of Provincial Rangers.\r\n\r\nBouquet established his rendezvous in Carlisle, where he arrived the\r\nlatter part of June, 1763. Here he found every building, every house,\r\nevery barn, every hovel crowded with terrified refugees. He wrote to\r\nGeneral Amherst, July 13, as follows:\r\n\r\n“The list of people known to be killed increases every day. The\r\ndesolation of so many families, reduced to the last extremity of want\r\nand misery; the despair of those who have lost their parents, relations\r\nand friends, with the cries of distracted women and children who fill\r\nthe streets, form a scene painful to humanity and impossible to\r\ndescribe.”\r\n\r\nStrange as it may seem, the Province of Pennsylvania would do nothing to\r\naid the troops who gathered for its defense. Colonel Bouquet, in another\r\nletter to General Amherst, said: “I hope we shall be able to save that\r\ninfatuated people from destruction, notwithstanding all their endeavors\r\nto defeat your vigorous measures.”\r\n\r\nWhile Bouquet, harassed and exasperated, labored on at his difficult\r\ntask, the terror of the frontier people increased, until at last,\r\nfinding they could hope for but little aid from the Government, they\r\nbestirred themselves with admirable spirit in their own defense. They\r\nraised small bodies of riflemen, who scoured the woods in front of the\r\nsettlements, and succeeded in driving the enemy back. In many instances\r\nthe men dressed themselves in Indian fashion, painted their faces red\r\nand black, and adopted the savage mode of warfare.\r\n\r\nForts Pitt, Niagara and Detroit were saved. Colonel Bouquet relieved\r\nFort Pitt; Niagara was not attacked, and Detroit, after a long siege by\r\nPontiac in person, was relieved by Colonel Bradstreet in 1764.\r\n\r\nThe Indians were speedily subdued, but Pontiac remained hostile until\r\nhis death in 1769.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Meschianza, Stupendous Entertainment for\r\n                       Sir Wm. Howe, May 18, 1778\r\n\r\n\r\nThe British spent the winter of 1777–78 in Philadelphia, and while the\r\nAmericans were suffering at Valley Forge, Sir William Howe’s army\r\nenjoyed one long round of pleasure in the capital city. The officers\r\nentertained themselves with fetes, dances and theatre parties, and they\r\nplayed cricket and had cock-fights. As Franklin said: “Howe did not take\r\nPhiladelphia—Philadelphia took Howe.”\r\n\r\nHowe was criticized at home, where he was regarded as indolent in\r\ncommand and he resigned. Sir Henry Clinton superseded him.\r\n\r\nOn May 18, 1778, before Howe’s departure, a fete at the home of Thomas\r\nWharton, at Walnut Grove, was arranged for him by Major John Andre, a\r\ntalented man, attractive to the ladies, who was later hanged as a spy.\r\nIt was called the Meschianza, and comprised a regatta, tournament, feast\r\nand ball. It was a splendid folly in itself, and is notorious in\r\nAmerican history.\r\n\r\nAfter all, the performance must have been crude and some of the features\r\nof it in bad taste and incongruous. The elements of the medley would not\r\nmix. Major Andre says the cost of the entertainment was defrayed by\r\ntwenty-two officers of Howe’s staff.\r\n\r\nThe Meschianza began with a regatta, which was in fact a military\r\nprocession along the waterfront; boats, barges and galleys, filled with\r\nguests and officers, including Lord Howe, General Howe, Sir Henry\r\nClinton, Lord Rawdon and General Knyphausen, moving in three divisions\r\ndown the river, the surrounding vessels decked with flags and the\r\nwharves teaming with spectators.\r\n\r\nAs the company disembarked at the Wharton mansion they marched through\r\nfiles of grenadiers and light horse. On the lawn the bands in massed\r\nformation played favorite airs. Triumphal arches were erected on the\r\nlawn near the mansion, under which the ladies were received as at a\r\nroyal court.\r\n\r\nHere were seated seven of the principal belles dressed in Turkish habits\r\nand wearing in their turbans the favors with which they meant to reward\r\nthe several knights who were to contend in their honor. At a blast of\r\nthe trumpets, a band of knights, dressed in ancient habits and mounted\r\non gray horses, with rich trappings, dashed into the court. Each knight\r\nwas accompanied by an esquire on foot. There were heralds and others,\r\nall in robes of ceremony.\r\n\r\nLord Cathcart, superbly mounted, appeared as the chief of the White\r\nKnights. His lady was Miss Auchmuty. Then came Captain Cathcart, the\r\nfirst knight, in honor of Miss N. White; Lieutenant Bygrove and Miss\r\nJane Craig; Captain Andre and Miss Peggy Chew; Captain Horneck and Miss\r\nNancy Redman; Captain Matthews and Miss Wilhelmina Bond, Lieutenant\r\nSloper and Miss Mary Shippen.\r\n\r\nA herald then proclaimed a challenge for “The Knights of the Blended\r\nRose,” which was accepted by “The Knights of the Burning Mountain,” led\r\nby Captain Watson, of the Black Knights, whose particular lady was Miss\r\nRebecca Franks. These knights and their ladies were Lieutenant Underwood\r\nand Miss Sarah Shippen, Lieutenant Winyard and Miss Peggy Shippen,\r\nLieutenant Delaval and Miss Becky Bond, Monsier Montluissant and Miss\r\nRebecca Redman, Lieutenant Hobart and Miss Sophia Chew and Major\r\nTarleton and Miss Wilhelmina Smith.\r\n\r\nThese ladies wore costumes uniformly similar to that adopted by their\r\nknights. The ladies of the Blended Rose each wore white silk, pink sash\r\nand spangled shoes and stockings. The ladies of the Burning Mountain\r\nwore white silk gowns trimmed with black and white sashes edged with\r\nblack.\r\n\r\nThe Black Knights threw down the gauntlet to the White Knights. It was\r\npicked up. Then the knights fixed their lances and shields and,\r\ngalloping at full speed, encountered several times. The third such\r\ncharge was ended by the firing of pistols, then the sword of combat, and\r\nat last the two chiefs engaged in single combat, till the marshal, Major\r\nGwynne, rushed between them and declared that the fair damsels of the\r\nBlended Rose and the Burning Mountain were satisfied with the feats of\r\nvalor of their respective knights, and favors were then distributed, and\r\nthe knights rode off the field.\r\n\r\nThey then reappeared riding through the triumphal arch and presented\r\nthemselves to Lord Howe, which was followed by a grand procession. The\r\nentertainment then continued in the mansion, which had been transformed\r\nfor the occasion into an Egyptian palace. The ballroom contained\r\neighty-five large mirrors, and was lighted with thirty-four branches of\r\nwax-lights.\r\n\r\nThe four drawing rooms where the refreshments were served were decorated\r\nand lighted in the same style and taste as the ballroom.\r\n\r\nThe ball by the knights and their ladies, and the dancing continued\r\nuntil 10 o’clock when the windows were thrown open and a magnificent\r\nbouquet of rockets began the fireworks.\r\n\r\nThis part of the elaborate entertainment was designed by Captain\r\nMontressor, the chief engineer, and consisted of twenty different\r\nexhibitions, displayed under his direction and to the delight and\r\nsatisfaction of all present. The conclusion was the illumination of the\r\ntriumphal arch, with a display of all the trophies.\r\n\r\nAt midnight supper was announced, and large folding-doors, suddenly\r\nthrown open, disclosed a magnificent salon 210 feet by 40. Here again\r\nmany mirrors, artificial flowers and clusters of lights were made to\r\nproduce a wonderful effect. Covers were laid for 430 guests.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the supper the herald of the Blended Rose attended,\r\nentered the saloon and proclaimed the King’s health, the Queen, royal\r\nfamily, army, navy, their commanders, the knights and their ladies and\r\nthe ladies in general, each of these toasts being accompanied by a\r\nflourish of music. Dancing was then continued until 4 o’clock.\r\n\r\nWhile this revelry was at its height the sound of cannon was heard in\r\nthe North. The English officers explained to their frightened partners\r\nin the dance that it was part of the ceremony. But it was not. Captain\r\nMcLane, a dashing officer, hearing of the Meschianza, at the head of 100\r\ninfantry and Clow’s dragoons, reached the line of redoubts between the\r\nDelaware and Schuylkill, painted everything within reach with tar and,\r\nat a given signal, set it on fire. The sudden blaze took the British by\r\nsurprise, the long roll was beaten, every cannon in the redoubts was\r\nfired. The British cavalry dashed out into the night, but the daring\r\nAmericans were nowhere to be found.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Colonel Pluck Parades His Celebrated\r\n                    “Bloody Eighty-Fourth” Regiment,\r\n\r\nMay 19, 1825\r\n\r\n\r\nAn amusing sensation started in 1824 continued to attract attention in\r\nPhiladelphia during the following year.\r\n\r\nThere had been more or less laxity in the various militia organizations\r\nin the election of their officers and this was much more evident in\r\nPhiladelphia than elsewhere in the State.\r\n\r\nJohn Pluck, an ignorant hostler, was elected colonel of the\r\nEighty-fourth Regiment as a joke and to ridicule the militia system,\r\nwhich at that moment was very unpopular with the members.\r\n\r\nThis election had been resisted by many who were disinclined to treat so\r\nserious a matter jocularly, and the board of officers set aside the\r\nelection as illegal, and ordered a new election.\r\n\r\nAt the next election John Pluck received 447 votes; Benjamin Harter, 64;\r\nand John Ferdey, commonly called “Whistling Johnny,” 15.\r\n\r\nThe successful candidate treated the matter seriously and issued an\r\norder for a parade of the First Battalion on May 1, on Callowhill\r\nStreet, the right resting on Sixth Street; and the Second Battalion was\r\nordered to parade at the same place on May 19.\r\n\r\nThe order further directed that Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph Norbury was to\r\ncommand the training of the First Battalion. The colonel himself was to\r\ntake charge of the Second Battalion.\r\n\r\nThe papers of that day do not notice the parade of the First Battalion,\r\nwhich was scheduled for May 1, but they have much to say about the big\r\nparade of May 19.\r\n\r\nIt seems that by this time most of the militiamen in the regiment fully\r\nsensed the ridiculous position they were in with such an ignorant\r\ncommander, and on the occasion of this much heralded parade the members\r\nappeared in fantastic costumes.\r\n\r\nMany of the militiamen were armed with ponderous imitations of weapons,\r\nand a large number of the populace turned out in the parade, dressed in\r\nevery imaginable sort of costume, such as would even cause a ripple of\r\nlaughter at Hallowe’en; these were armed with brooms, rakes, hoes and\r\nevery conception of weapon.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia had never before witnessed such a “military” parade, and\r\nwas quite unaccustomed to such a display, and this regimental review of\r\n“horribles” attracted much attention.\r\n\r\nColonel Pluck was mounted on a fine steed, and Adjutant Roberts, also\r\nwell mounted, were the moving spirits of the parade and did not seem to\r\nfully realize the burlesque features of it.\r\n\r\nThe regiment marched out to Bush Hill, followed by thousands of people\r\non foot and hundreds on horseback.\r\n\r\nThe press was either silent or expressed dissatisfaction. It could not\r\nhave done otherwise.\r\n\r\nA few days following the parade Colonel Pluck issued new orders. He\r\nsaid: “Well, I am an honest man, anyhow. And I ain’t afraid to fight,\r\nand that’s more than most of them can say.”\r\n\r\nThe United States Gazette said, “Pluck is the head groom at the corner\r\nof Third and Callowhill Streets. Some months ago he was chosen\r\ncommander-in-chief of the ‘bloody Eighty-fourth;’ but the powers that be\r\nrefused to commission him. * * * The Militia system is a farce.\r\nDemagogues have been using commissions in the militia as stepping-stones\r\nto offices of profit and honor. A cure must be found for the evil, which\r\nis to make fun of it.”\r\n\r\nThe “Pluck Parade” rendered one other good service to Philadelphia. When\r\nthe regiment paraded to Bush Hill and wound up the day in disorderly\r\nfrivolities, the grand jury in June declared Bush Hill a public\r\nnuisance. This was a large open field on the north side of Callowhill\r\nStreet, between Schuylkill Fourth and Schuylkill Fifth.\r\n\r\nThe presentment of the grand jury states that men and women resorted\r\nthere on various days, as well as on the Sabbath, “drinking, tippling,\r\ncursing, swearing, etc.” The grand jury further said that it had\r\n“particular reference to the days on which regiments and battalions of\r\nmilitia parade, when numerous booths, tents, and gaming tables are there\r\nerected.”\r\n\r\nIt would be supposed that such a fantastic exhibition, directed against\r\nthe militia system, would soon cause a change in the existing law, but\r\nit did no such thing.\r\n\r\nThe act of Assembly of April 2, 1822, had reorganized the militia of\r\nPennsylvania, and divided the State into sixteen military divisions.\r\n\r\nBut the act did not work to the advantage of the militia system. It\r\ndeveloped a lot of merely dress parade organizations, which were usually\r\nequipped with costly and gaudy uniforms, while discipline and military\r\nregulations became at once of secondary importance.\r\n\r\nFrom 1808 to 1844, the laws were principally for designating independent\r\ncompanies with high-sounding names. Such militiamen were exempted from\r\ndrilling with regular militia, and occasionally the Legislature made\r\nappropriations to certain favored companies.\r\n\r\nThe music on days of general muster was not only made a special feature\r\nof the occasion but its cost was borne by the State.\r\n\r\nSo it is little wonder that the “Bloody Eighty-fourth,” elected “Colonel\r\nPluck,” or that the populace and papers of that day demanded a change in\r\nthe militia system of the State.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Lafayette Executes Skillful Retreat at Matson’s\r\n                           Ford, May 20, 1778\r\n\r\n\r\nAs an appropriate closing to the round of dissipation in which the\r\nBritish Army had indulged during its occupation of Philadelphia, the\r\nofficers gave a magnificent entertainment, called the Meschianza, in\r\nhonor of Sir William Howe, as commander-in-chief of the British Army in\r\nAmerica. This stupendous folly was given May 18, 1778, at the Wharton\r\nmansion.\r\n\r\nShortly after the close of the entertainment, on the following day, the\r\nBritish commander was informed that General Lafayette with 2400 men and\r\nfive cannon had crossed the Schuylkill and was then at Barren Hill,\r\nabout eleven miles from Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nIn the hope of capturing this force, and thus signalizing his retirement\r\nfrom the command by a brilliant stroke, General Howe, on the night of\r\nthe 19th, sent General Grant, with Sir William Erskine and General Grey,\r\nat the head of 5300 chosen men, to gain the rear of Lafayette’s position\r\nby a circuitous route. General Howe, accompanied by Sir Henry Clinton,\r\nGeneral Knyphausen and Admiral Howe, set out with 5700 troops on the\r\nfollowing morning, May 20, expecting to intercept the American Army in\r\nretreat at Chestnut Hill.\r\n\r\nLafayette’s position was skillfully chosen. His troops were encamped on\r\na commanding eminence west of the Wissahickon, flanked by the Schuylkill\r\nand rocky precipices on the right and by woods and several strong stone\r\nhouses on the left. His cannon were in front. A few hundred yards in\r\nadvance of his left wing, on the Ridge road, were Captain Allen McLane’s\r\ncompany of about fifty Indians and a company of Morgan’s Riflemen, under\r\nCaptain Parr. Videttes and pickets were stationed on the roads leading\r\nto Philadelphia and those toward Whitemarsh he had ordered to be watched\r\nby 600 Pennsylvania militia.\r\n\r\nThe British plan of surprise was well conceived. Grant, with the\r\ngrenadiers and light infantry, undertook to get in Lafayette’s rear by\r\nthe Whitemarsh road. Grey, with the Hessians, was to cross the river and\r\npost his men at the fords in order to prevent the Americans from making\r\ntheir escape.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning of the 20th, while Lafayette was conversing with a\r\ngirl who was preparing to go into Philadelphia for intelligence under\r\nthe pretense of visiting her relations, news came that a body of cavalry\r\nhad been seen at Whitemarsh, dressed in red. As Lafayette was expecting\r\na detachment of dragoons to join him in that direction, he at first\r\nsupposed they were his own men and felt no concern.\r\n\r\nLafayette, however, sent out an officer to reconnoiter, who soon\r\nreturned with the report that a column of the enemy was in full march\r\nalong the road from Whitemarsh to Swede’s Ford, a little more than a\r\nmile from his encampment, and that the front of the column had actually\r\ngained the road which led from Barren Hill to Valley Forge.\r\n\r\nThis was Grant’s division and as another was approaching on the\r\nPhiladelphia road, the situation of Lafayette’s force was alarming and\r\ncritical, being nearly surrounded by the enemy.\r\n\r\nNo time was to be lost. In a few minutes retreat would have been cut off\r\nand the army would have fallen an easy prey to the British. Lafayette\r\nimmediately sent forward small bodies of troops with the view of\r\ndeceiving Grant into the belief that they were the heads of a large\r\nattacking force.\r\n\r\nThis ruse succeeded. Grant halted and prepared for action to prevent his\r\nline from being attacked on its flank, and during the interval thus\r\ngained Lafayette and General Poor, with the main body, conducted a\r\nskillful retreat over the country between the Ridge road and the\r\nSchuylkill, which he crossed at Matson’s Ford.\r\n\r\nGrey, with his intercepting force, had cut off the direct retreat to\r\nValley Forge, but had failed to cover Matson’s Ford. The detachments\r\nwhich Lafayette had thrown forward as a “blind” retreated in good order,\r\nand when the two columns of the British Army united near Barren Hill\r\nChurch, General Howe discovered that his intended prize had outwitted\r\nand escaped him.\r\n\r\nWhile the artillery was crossing the river, there was a skirmish at\r\nMatson’s Ford, in which nine Americans were killed or captured and two\r\nBritish troopers killed and several wounded.\r\n\r\nLafayette drew up his force in strong position on the west bank of the\r\nriver, and, having planted his cannon, awaited the enemy’s approach. But\r\nthe British generals made no further movement in that direction, and the\r\narmy was forced to return to Philadelphia, after a long and fatiguing\r\nmarch, without having accomplished anything. Seldom has a military\r\nmaneuvre been executed with more success.\r\n\r\nHowe and the British officers were intensely mortified at this failure.\r\nSo sure were they of success that it is said that before the troops left\r\nfor Barren Hill the General invited some ladies to sup with Lafayette\r\nupon his return, while his brother, the admiral, prepared a frigate to\r\nsend the distinguished prisoner immediately to England.\r\n\r\nFortune had favored the British in so far that Lafayette would not have\r\nbeen surprised, but for the negligence of the Pennsylvania militia, who\r\nin disobedience of orders, had removed from their station at Whitemarsh\r\nwithout the General’s knowledge.\r\n\r\nAn amusing adventure occurred during the retreat. A body of British\r\nlight horse came suddenly upon the Indians, who were posted in a wood at\r\na considerable distance from the main army. The Indians fired their\r\nmuskets and set up a hideous yell, according to their custom in battle.\r\nBoth parties ran off, equally frightened at the unexpected and terrific\r\nappearance of their antagonists.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Stephen Girard, Resident of Philadelphia by\r\n                      Accident, Born May 21, 1750\r\n\r\n\r\nStephen Girard was born near Bordeaux, France, May 21, 1750, the son of\r\na sea captain. At the age of eight a little playmate threw an oyster\r\nshell into the open fire, it cracked, a piece struck Stephen and put out\r\nhis right eye. The other boys of the neighborhood made fun of the\r\none-eyed lad, which, with the sternness of his parents soured Stephen’s\r\ndisposition, and he became sullen and gloomy.\r\n\r\nHis mother died, and Stephen could no longer bear to live at home.\r\nAlthough but fourteen he sailed as cabin boy on the ship Pelerin for St.\r\nDomingo, and then for nine years sailed between Bordeaux and the French\r\nWest Indies, during which time he studied navigation, until October 4,\r\n1773, a license was issued “to Stephen Girard, of Bordeaux, full\r\nauthority to act as captain, master and patron of a merchant vessel.”\r\n\r\nHis attention now turned to commercial affairs in connection with the\r\npursuit of the sea. His journal contains records of invoices and sales\r\nof goods suited to a West Indian market. These goods, amounting in value\r\nto $3000 Federal money, were disposed of in St. Domingo, February, 1774.\r\n\r\nFrom the West Indies he sailed to New York, arrived there July, 1774.\r\nHere his business tact and shrewdness in trade attracted the notice of\r\nThomas Randall, a prosperous merchant, and for more than two years\r\nGirard traded with New York, New Orleans and Port au Prince, on his own\r\naccount and jointly with Mr. Randall.\r\n\r\nOne night in May, 1776, Stephen Girard’s vessel was overtaken by a storm\r\nand the ship was driven before the gale, until Captain Girard could hear\r\nthe waves upon the shore. He cast anchor and waited for the morning.\r\nWhen daylight dawned the fog was too heavy for him to locate his\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nGirard fired a cannon as a signal of distress, which was soon answered\r\nby the approach of a pilot. “Where are we?” asked Captain Girard. “You\r\nare in Delaware Bay,” answered the pilot. “I wish to go to New York,”\r\nsaid Girard. “It can’t be done,” was the reply, “the British ships are\r\nswarming outside. You escaped them because of the fog but as soon as it\r\ndisappears they will see and capture you. You must sail up to\r\nPhiladelphia.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Stephen Girard saw that the advice was good, went to\r\nPhiladelphia, sold his vessel and cargo, and made the city his home.\r\n\r\nHe set up a small store on Water Street, a short distance from the spot\r\nwhere he afterward located. He had no friends, and could speak English\r\nbut poorly, but his business ability was so pronounced that he succeeded\r\nfrom the very beginning.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1777, he married Mary Lumm, of Philadelphia, the daughter of a\r\nshipbuilder, but the union was unhappy. Mr. Girard applied for a\r\ndivorce, but his wife died of insanity in a hospital.\r\n\r\nThe approach of the British troops to Philadelphia drove Mr. Girard to\r\nMount Holly, N. J., where he enjoyed a profitable trade with the\r\nAmerican sailors, until the evacuation of Philadelphia, when he returned\r\nand for a few years was associated in business with his brother, John.\r\nThis connection was dissolved in 1780, by which time Stephen had gained\r\na fortune of $30,000.\r\n\r\nDuring the next ten years he acquired a number of vessels, and had\r\nsecured the lease on a range of stores at a time when rents were low,\r\nwhich he underlet at a large profit. He began to build a splendid fleet\r\nof ships, and soon every ocean saw Girard’s vessels.\r\n\r\nOnce when the United States was again troubled by the British, a ship\r\nowned by Girard, carrying a rich cargo from the East, almost in sight of\r\nDelaware Bay, was captured. Girard drove a bargain with the British\r\ncaptain and bought back his vessel for $180,000. Then he brought her to\r\nPhiladelphia and sold the cargo for $500,000. It was difficult to beat\r\nStephen Girard.\r\n\r\nHe was very frugal in private life, but generous in public affairs.\r\nDuring the yellow fever epidemic in 1793, Girard personally devoted\r\nseveral hours each day serving in the hospital. Of all his benefactions\r\nfor the poor of his adopted country, this was really his noblest work.\r\n\r\nHis mercantile business had grown so profitable and his fortune had\r\nincreased so rapidly that in June, 1812, he determined to devote his\r\nattention to banking. To this end he purchased the bank-house of the\r\nBank of the United States and opened “The Bank of Stephen Girard,” with\r\na capital of $1,200,000, which was increased afterward to $4,000,000.\r\n\r\nJust as Robert Morris was the financier of the Revolution, so Stephen\r\nGirard was the financier of the War of 1812. In 1814 it looked as though\r\nthe American cause must fail for lack of funds, and the heads of the\r\nnational Government were in despair. A loan was offered in the money\r\nmarket, but so low was the credit of the Nation that only $200,000 was\r\nsubscribed. Thereupon Stephen Girard took the whole issue of bonds,\r\namounting to $5,000,000, and saved us from defeat and a disgraceful\r\npeace with England.\r\n\r\nGirard contributed liberally to public improvements, and adorned\r\nPhiladelphia with many handsome buildings.\r\n\r\nAt the age of eighty Girard was the richest man in America. The same\r\nyear he was knocked down by a carriage and badly injured. “Go on,\r\ndoctor, I am an old sailor; I can bear a great deal,” he said to his\r\nphysician. He lived two years afterward.\r\n\r\nWhen he died, December 26, 1831, his estate was valued at $9,000,000.\r\nBesides large bequests to public institutions, he gave $500,000 to\r\nimprove the water front of Philadelphia. He gave $2,000,000 and a plot\r\nof ground for the erection and support of a college for orphans, which\r\nwas opened January 1, 1848.\r\n\r\nAt his death he was buried in the vault of the Holy Trinity Roman\r\nCatholic Church, but on the completion of Girard College his remains\r\nwere reinterred in a sarcophagus beneath the statue of the donor in the\r\nvestibule of the main building of the college.\r\n\r\nGirard College is the most richly endowed educational institution in the\r\nworld, and its founder was one of the most remarkable men who ever\r\nlived, and his accidental residence in Philadelphia was one of the most\r\nfortunate incidents in the history of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Philadelphia Paid Homage to Lady\r\n                        Washington, May 22, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nThe completion of the Federal Constitution and its adoption by ten of\r\nthe United States was celebrated on July 4, 1788, by a great procession\r\nin the City of Philadelphia. And it was truly a great affair, far\r\nsurpassing in extent and magnificence anything of the kind the young\r\nNation had yet known.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the close of the constitutional convention which this\r\npageant celebrated, General Washington, who had presided over the\r\nconvention as its president, left Philadelphia for his home at Mount\r\nVernon, again hoping that he might enjoy the freedom of life on his\r\nextensive lands on the banks of the Potomac. But this could not be so in\r\nhis case.\r\n\r\nThe first election for President of the United States was held January\r\n7, 1789, and the country called Washington to be its first President\r\nunder the Constitution which he had helped to formulate. President-elect\r\nWashington set out from Mount Vernon for New York, where Congress was in\r\nsession, in April, after having been officially notified of his\r\nelection.\r\n\r\nHis many friends in Philadelphia were reluctant to see him go to New\r\nYork, but made elaborate preparations for his reception in Philadelphia\r\nwhen he should pass through that city on the way to assume the high\r\noffice. He was met by the Hon. Thomas Mifflin, president of the State;\r\ndistinguished officers, the First City Troop of Horse and citizens. The\r\nimposing parade passed through arches formed of laurel, and along\r\nstreets crowded with people and buildings decorated with flags. A\r\nbanquet was spread, toasts were drunk and addresses delivered by the\r\nhigh officials of the State.\r\n\r\nThe next day President Washington set out for Trenton in his carriage.\r\n\r\nLess than a month later Mrs. Washington, or Lady Washington, as many\r\npersisted in calling her, followed the general to New York and like her\r\ndistinguished husband, she was delightfully entertained by her many\r\nfriends and admirers in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, May 22, the two troops of Light Horse, commanded by Captain\r\nMiles and Bingham, accompanied by General Mifflin, president of the\r\nState; Richard Peters, Speaker of the Assembly, and many ladies and\r\ngentlemen prominent in Philadelphia and the State, went to a point near\r\nDarby to meet her. Mrs. Robert Morris with a company of ladies in\r\ncarriages joined the escort there.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Washington arrived all went to Grays Ferry where a fine\r\ncollation was served at Gray’s Garden. In the party besides the\r\npresident of the State and Speaker of the Assembly, were Temple\r\nFranklin, Benjamin Crew, Jr., Robert Morris, Jr., William Morris,\r\nRichard Bache, John Ross, Robert Hare, George Harrison, Samuel Meredith,\r\nalso the gentlemen troopers, a large number of Continental officers,\r\ncitizens and about twenty ladies.\r\n\r\nThere is a record of this luncheon and bill of expenses which reveal\r\nthat the company consumed ten bottles of Madeira wine, one bottle of\r\nchampagne, two bottles of claret, forty-five bowls of punch, ten bottles\r\nof American porter, one bottle of ale, and two bottles of cider.\r\n\r\nThe honored visitor was then escorted by the troopers to the residence\r\nof Robert Morris, on High Street, amid the ringing of bells, the\r\ndischarge of salvos of artillery, and the shouts of great crowds of\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nMrs. Washington remained in Philadelphia over the week-end. There were\r\nentertainments given in her honor during these two days.\r\n\r\nOn Monday she was similarly complimented upon her departure for New\r\nYork, and accompanied by Mrs. Robert Morris, she was escorted upon her\r\nway for a considerable distance.\r\n\r\nIn New York, on May 29, at the opening levee, Mrs. Morris occupied the\r\nfirst place on the right of the hostess. This position of honor was\r\naccorded her whenever she was present at a similar function, either in\r\nNew York or Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThe glad news was soon received in Philadelphia that the capital was to\r\nbe removed from New York to the city which had been the capital of the\r\nthirteen colonies during the Revolution and where the Constitution of\r\nthe United States was born.\r\n\r\nPresident and Mrs. Washington soon became comfortably settled in the\r\nfine home of Robert Morris, the same house which Sir William Howe\r\noccupied while the British were in possession of Philadelphia and\r\nGeneral Washington was suffering with the Colonial troops at Valley\r\nForge. The Morris house was built of brick, three stories high. The\r\nstable could accommodate twelve horses. This property was purchased by\r\nMr. Morris in August, 1785, and at once he rebuilt the house, which had\r\nbeen destroyed by fire in 1780. Mr. and Mrs. Morris moved into the house\r\nwhich had been confiscated from Joseph Galloway during the Revolution.\r\nIt adjoined the other residence.\r\n\r\nThe President and Mrs. Washington reached Philadelphia November 27,\r\n1790. At the first levee given Mr. and Mrs. Morris were, as usual,\r\nhonored guests.\r\n\r\nThe home of the Washingtons became noted for its generous hospitality.\r\nThe younger people of the President’s household, as well as their\r\nelders, were fond of going to the theatre.\r\n\r\nThe family of the President and his wife included Miss Custis, a\r\ngranddaughter of Mrs. Washington, aged about sixteen, and George\r\nWashington Custis, her brother, about eighteen years old.\r\n\r\nTheir dinners were elegant and in good taste. President Washington had a\r\nstud of twelve or fourteen horses and occasionally rode out to take the\r\nair with six horses to the coach, and always two footmen behind his\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\nWhen the news reached Philadelphia that Washington had died, bells were\r\nmuffled for three days, a funeral procession was held and Major General\r\nHenry Lee delivered an oration.\r\n\r\nWith Washington gone, the removal of the capital to the new Federal City\r\ndid not bring such a wrench to the people of Philadelphia, who dearly\r\nloved the great and good man and his estimable wife.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Moravian Mission at Wyalusing Established\r\n                              May 23, 1763\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the month of May, 1760, Christian Frederic Post, the renowned\r\nMoravian, on his way with a message from James Hamilton, Lieutenant\r\nGovernor of the Province of Pennsylvania, to the Great Indian Council at\r\nOnondaga, the seat of government of the Six Nations, stopped overnight\r\nat Wyalusing in now Bradford County. At the request of Papunhank, the\r\nchief of the Munsee, and the other Indians, he preached a sermon. Among\r\nthose in the crowd on that occasion were Job Chilloway, the friendly\r\nDelaware Indian interpreter, and Tom Curtis, another Indian of much\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\nPapunhank was losing his influence among his people on account of his\r\nown dissolute life, and a movement was started to bring in white\r\nteachers. In their councils, however, they were divided in opinion, one\r\nparty favoring the Quakers and the other the Moravians, and so equal was\r\nthe strength of the two parties that neither was willing to yield to the\r\nother. Their differences were compromised by agreeing to accept the\r\nfirst teacher who came.\r\n\r\nJohn Woolman, the prominent Quaker evangelist, having made the\r\nacquaintance of some of the Wyalusing Indians at Philadelphia, probably\r\nof Papunhank himself, after much deliberation, set out in company with\r\nBenjamin Parvin, to visit the town, in May, 1763, purposing, if he\r\nshould be well received, to remain with them and teach them the gospel.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, news of the awakened interest in religion at Wyalusing\r\nreached the ears of Reverend David Zeisberger, the celebrated Moravian\r\napostle to the Indians, and he left Bethlehem May 18, 1763, meeting\r\nWoolman on the mountain below Wilkes-Barre, where they dined together.\r\nZeisberger proceeded on his way and reached Wyalusing on May 23, two\r\ndays before Woolman arrived there.\r\n\r\nWhen Zeisberger had arrived a short distance above the Lackawanna, he\r\nwas met by Job Chilloway who informed him of the conclusion of the\r\ncouncil at Onondaga, and accompanied him to Papunhank’s town. Here\r\nZeisberger was received as the divinely sent messenger, and though\r\nwearied by his long journey, at once set about preaching the gospel to\r\nhis waiting and anxious hearers.\r\n\r\nWoolman, on his arrival two days later, was received kindly, but was\r\ninformed that, according to the decisions of their council, Zeisberger\r\nmust be regarded as their accepted teacher. After remaining five days to\r\nassist in inaugurating the good work, he departed, with many prayers for\r\nthe abundant success of the mission. The opportune arrival of Zeisberger\r\nwas the occasion of founding one of the most important and successful\r\nmissions ever established among the North American Indians.\r\n\r\nZeisberger was appointed resident missionary at Wyalusing soon as it was\r\nlearned that he had been so well received. He prosecuted his labors\r\nthere and at Tawandaemenk, a village at the mouth of Towanda Creek, with\r\ngreat success.\r\n\r\nScarcely had a month elapsed from the time Zeisberger’s first visit to\r\nWyalusing, before the Pontiac War broke out, and the messengers of that\r\ncelebrated chieftain were sent to every village on the Susquehanna, to\r\nurge the Indians to again take up the hatchet which they had so recently\r\nburied. These emissaries arrived at Wyalusing and Zeisberger was soon\r\ncommanded to leave the town. All was now excitement and commotion. The\r\nintrepid missionary was compelled to suspend the work so auspiciously\r\nbegun, but not before he had baptised Papunhank, who received the name\r\nof John, and another Indian who was called Peter.\r\n\r\nThe Moravian Christian Indians, for their greater security during the\r\nPontiac War, in which they refused to take any part, were removed first\r\nto a settlement near Bethlehem, and then to Province Island, in the\r\nDelaware River, a little below Philadelphia, where they were sheltered\r\nin Government barracks. Thither Papunhank and twenty of his followers\r\nhastened. Here they lived for seventeen months, and at the first dawn of\r\npeace, emerged from their prison-like home and again sought homes in the\r\nforest. Papunhank invited the whole company to settle in his town on the\r\nSusquehanna. They accepted and marched to that place, led by their\r\nbeloved teachers, Reverend Zeisberger and Reverend John Jacob Schmick.\r\n\r\nThis company, consisting of eighty adults and ninety children, set out\r\nfrom Bethlehem and after a tedious march of thirty-six days, arrived at\r\nWyalusing May 9, 1765. They immediately set about building their town,\r\nand during the season thirty bark-covered huts, four log cabins, a\r\nmission house and church were erected.\r\n\r\nThe town was built on the east side of the river, about two miles south\r\nof the present borough of Wyalusing, and near the Sugar Run Station on\r\nthe P. and N. Y. Railroad. The church was built of logs and had a belfry\r\nin which hung a bell. The town was surrounded by a post and rail fence.\r\nThe streets were regularly cleaned by the Indian women. Adjoining the\r\ntown were 250 acres of plantations. They also maintained sugar camps on\r\nSugar Run.\r\n\r\nThe mission in 1766 received the name of Friedenshutten, meaning “Huts\r\nof Peace.” A schoolhouse was built next to the church, where adults and\r\nchildren were taught to read in both Delaware and German. Traders were\r\nnot allowed to bring spirituous liquors into the town.\r\n\r\nIn 1767 the mission entertained Tuscarora and Nanticoke Indians on their\r\nmigration northward.\r\n\r\nAnother mission was started at Sheshequanink, the present Ulster, soon\r\nafter the close of the Pontiac War, but did not prosper as much as the\r\nolder one. At the treaty of Fort Stanwix, November 5, 1768, the Six\r\nNations sold this land away from the Delaware, and the Moravians were\r\nunable to induce Governor Penn to give them the land.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1766, Zeisberger left Friedenhutten, and went to the\r\nDelaware Indians on the Ohio River, where he established a mission. He\r\nsoon induced the Indians at Wyalusing to follow him, and on June 11,\r\n1772, the Indians at Wyalusing assembled in the church for the last time\r\nand then they marched in two companies for the Big Beaver, in now\r\nLawrence County. They were led by the Reverend John Ettwein on this\r\njourney.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Peaceful Family of Chief Logan Slain by\r\n                          Whites, May 24, 1774\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the spring of the year 1774, at a time when the Indians seemed to be\r\nquiet and tranquil, a party of Virginians attacked the Mingo settlement,\r\non the Ohio River, and slaughtered the entire population, even the women\r\nwith their children in their arms, and members of the great Chief\r\nLogan’s family were among the slain.\r\n\r\nThis tragic event occurred on May 24, 1774, and according to the common\r\nbelief at the time was perpetrated by Captain Michael Cresap, and a\r\nparty who deliberately set out to kill every Indian they met, without\r\nregard to age or sex.\r\n\r\nThe first person to state that Logan’s family was murdered by Cresap was\r\nno other than Thomas Jefferson, in his “Notes in Virginia.”\r\n\r\nThe main authority for the vindication of Michael Cresap’s memory, is\r\nthe extremely rare little volume, Jacob’s “Life of Cresap,” published in\r\n1826. Jacob sets up an alibi for Cresap, but the present writer accepts\r\nthe popular story that the wanton murder was perpetrated under the\r\ndirection of Cresap.\r\n\r\nTahgahjute was the second son of Shikellamy, the great vicegerent of the\r\nSix Nations. He was born at Shamokin, about 1725, and was given his\r\nChristian name Logan in honor of James Logan, Secretary of the Province,\r\nwho was a devoted friend of the great Shikellamy.\r\n\r\nBut little is known of the early life of Logan, but he worked his way\r\nWest by degrees. He was for a time on the Juniata, where several places\r\nstill bear his name, but his final home was near the mouth of the Yellow\r\nCreek, thirty miles above Wheeling.\r\n\r\nReverend John Heckewelder, the noted Moravian missionary among the\r\nIndians, while passing down the Ohio, in April, 1773, stopped at Logan’s\r\nsettlement and in his interesting journal notes that “I received every\r\ncivility I could expect from such of the family as were at home.”\r\n\r\nCresap was on the Ohio, below Wheeling, engaged in making a settlement.\r\nSome pioneers resolved to attack an Indian town near the mouth of the\r\nSciota, and solicited Cresap to command the expedition. They attacked\r\ntwo canoes filled with Indians, chased them fifteen miles down the\r\nriver, where a skirmish ensued, and the Indians who were not killed were\r\ntaken. On the return of this party they planned an expedition against\r\nthe settlement of Logan.\r\n\r\nCresap and his party proceeded to a point near the settlement and\r\nencamped on the bank, when some Indians passed them peaceably and\r\nencamped at the mouth of Grave Creek, a little below. Cresap attacked\r\nand killed the party. One of Cresap’s men fell in this action. Among the\r\nslain of the Indians were some of Logan’s family. Smith, one of the\r\nmurderers, boasted of this fact in the presence of Logan’s friends.\r\n\r\nThis party then proceeded to Baker’s Bottom, opposite the mouth of\r\nYellow Creek, when Greathouse, a spy, crossed over and approached the\r\nIndian camp as a friend and counted them. He reported their number too\r\nlarge to attack and was then warned by an Indian woman to leave, as the\r\nIndians had learned of Cresap’s murder of their relatives at Grave Creek\r\nand were angry and that they were drinking.\r\n\r\nHe returned to Baker’s, collected a large enough force, all got drunk,\r\nand then in that condition they fell upon and massacred the whole Indian\r\ncamp except a girl, whom they kept as a prisoner. Among the slain was\r\nthe woman who had warned him of his danger. A sister of Logan was\r\ninhumanly and indecently butchered in this attack.\r\n\r\nThis commenced the war, of which Logan’s war club was the chief factor.\r\nThe first family murdered by him was the warning of what might be\r\nexpected. Logan left a note in the house of the murdered family, and,\r\ntrue to his threat, great numbers of innocent men, women and children\r\nfell victims to the tomahawk and scalping knife until the decisive\r\nbattle at Point Pleasant October 10, 1774.\r\n\r\nWhen Lord Dunmore finally conquered the Indians and the treaty was held,\r\nCornstalk was the principal speaker. He laid much stress for the cause\r\nof the war on the murder of Logan’s family. Logan disdained to meet with\r\nthe white men in council and sat sullenly in his cabin while the treaty\r\nwas in progress. Dunmore sent Captain (afterward Major General) John\r\nGibson to invite him to the council. General Gibson later became one of\r\nthe Associate Judges of Allegheny County.\r\n\r\nThe old Mingo chief took Gibson into the woods and, sitting down upon a\r\nmossy root, told him the story of the wrongs done to him and, as Gibson\r\nrelated, shedding many bitter tears. He refused to go to the council,\r\nbut, unwilling to disturb the deliberations by seeming opposition, he\r\nsent a speech by the hand of Gibson to Governor Dunmore, which has been\r\npreserved and greatly admired for its pathetic eloquence. The speech was\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n“I appeal to any white man to say, if ever he entered Logan’s cabin\r\nhungry, and he gave him not meat; if ever he came cold and naked, and he\r\nclothed him not. During the course of the last long and bloody war,\r\nLogan remained idle in his cabin, an advocate for peace. Such was my\r\nlove for the white, that my countrymen pointed as they passed and said,\r\n‘Logan is the friend of the white man.’ I had ever thought to have lived\r\nwith you, but for the injuries of one man, Colonel Cresap, the last\r\nspring, in cold blood, and unprovoked, murdered all the relations of\r\nLogan, not even sparing my women and children. There runs not a drop of\r\nmy blood in the veins of any living creature. This called on me for\r\nrevenge. I have sought it. I have killed many; I have fully glutted my\r\nvengeance. For my country, I rejoice at the beams of peace. But do not\r\nharbor a thought that mine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt fear. He\r\nwill not turn on his heel to save his life. Who is there to mourn for\r\nLogan? Not one.”\r\n\r\nLossing, in his “Field-Book of the Revolution,” says: “Logan, whose\r\nmajestic person and mental accomplishments were the theme of favorable\r\nremark, became a victim of intemperance. Earlier than the time when\r\nDunmore called him to council, he was addicted to the habit. The last\r\nthree years of his life were very melancholy. Notwithstanding the\r\nmiseries he had suffered at the hands of the white men, his benevolences\r\nmade him the prisoner’s friend, until intemperance blunted his\r\nsensibilities, and in 1780 we find him among the marauders at Ruddell’s\r\nStation.”\r\n\r\nThe manner of his death is differently related. The patient researches\r\nof Mr. Mayer lead the writer to adopt his as the correct one, as it was\r\nfrom the lips of an aged Mohawk whom he saw at Caghnawaga, twelve miles\r\nfrom Montreal, in the summer of 1848. His mother was a Shawnee woman,\r\nand when he was a boy he often saw Logan. Mayer says:\r\n\r\n“In a drunken frenzy near Detroit, in 1780, Logan struck his wife to the\r\nground. Believing her dead, he fled to the wilderness. Between Detroit\r\nand Sandusky, he was overtaken by a troop of Indian men, women and\r\nchildren. Not yet sober, he imagined that the penalty of his crime was\r\nabout to be inflicted by a relative. Being well armed, he declared that\r\nthe whole party should be destroyed. In defense, his nephew, Todkahdohs,\r\nkilled him on the spot, by a shot from his gun. His wife recovered from\r\nhis blow.” Chief Logan died November 28, 1780.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Hamilton Pleads with Governor of Maryland\r\n                     for Release of Pennsylvanians,\r\n                              May 25, 1734\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas Penn informed the Council, May 14, 1734, that the business then\r\nto be considered by them related to some very unneighborly proceedings\r\nin the province of Maryland, in not only harassing some of the\r\ninhabitants of this province who live on the border, but likewise\r\nextending their claims much farther than has heretofore been pretended\r\nto be Maryland, and carrying off several persons and imprisoning them.\r\n\r\nGovernor Penn then advised the Council that Marylanders had entered the\r\nsettlements of John Hendricks and Joshua Minshall, on the Susquehanna,\r\nin what is now York County, and carried them off to Annapolis and\r\nconfined them in jail.\r\n\r\nThe Governor arranged with Andrew Hamilton, Esq., to appear for the\r\nprisoners. He was accompanied by John Georges, his secretary.\r\n\r\nThey made their visit and on their return made a full report to Governor\r\nPenn.\r\n\r\nHamilton related that they were denied an interview with the prisoners,\r\nbut this was allowed them the following day, when the prisoners gave an\r\naccount of their arrest. They did not know what charges were lodged\r\nagainst them.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer then appealed to Governor Ogle who advised them that the\r\ncharges against the prisoners were serious. Hamilton suggested that even\r\nif this be true the men were taken into custody by Maryland officials on\r\nPennsylvania soil, and should be punished in that province.\r\n\r\nGovernor Ogle then ennumerated the many abuses the inhabitants of\r\nMaryland had suffered from those of Pennsylvania. This interview ended\r\nby appointment for a meeting before council on the following morning. At\r\nthis meeting, which was pretty much bluff and bluster, but little was\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, agreed that each party should reduce their claims to\r\nwriting and then present them to the King for settlement.\r\n\r\nHamilton prepared his instrument and ably defended the part of\r\nPennsylvania, and recited the agreements of 1724 and 1732, which were\r\nintended to quiet all disputes on the border, until actual surveys\r\nshould be concluded.\r\n\r\nHe stated that notwithstanding these agreements, “two of his Majesty’s\r\nsubjects, John Hendricks and Joshua Minshall, inhabitants of Lancaster\r\nCounty, settled upon lands legally surveyed and patented to them under\r\nthe proprietors of Pennsylvania, on the west side of the river\r\nSusquehanna, had been taken from their homes, which were at least eight\r\nmiles to the northward of Philadelphia, and about twenty-three miles to\r\nthe northward of the line agreed upon by the aforesaid articles to be\r\nthe northern bounds of Maryland, which line runs near the mouth of\r\nOctoraroe Creek, to the northward of which Maryland has never exercised\r\nany jurisdiction, except over thirteen families, that is known to\r\nPennsylvania, till within two or three years, about the time when an\r\nabsolute boundary was agreed upon by the proprietors, though\r\nPennsylvania has maintained its government as far southward as the mouth\r\nof the said creek for above these thirty years.”\r\n\r\nThe jail was too filthy to hold further conversation with the four\r\nPennsylvanians and permission was obtained for the sheriff to take them\r\nto his home, where the interview was had.\r\n\r\nThey insisted they had never done or said anything against Lord\r\nBaltimore, and that if such was charged against them Thomas Cresap is\r\nthe only man wicked enough to bring such false charges.\r\n\r\nHamilton could not get his clients into court as they were under\r\nprosecution in Provincial Court, and Governor Ogle would not interfere.\r\n\r\nSeveral interviews were held with the Governor, even in his own home,\r\nbut at each the executive insisted on reviewing a long list of\r\ntransgressions along the border and would not agree to anything Hamilton\r\nhad to propose.\r\n\r\nOn May 25 the most important session was had and Governor Ogle refused\r\neven to concur in the proposal made by Hamilton that they agree upon\r\nbounds which should be judged reasonable, upon which lands no persons\r\nshould plant new settlements under severe penalties.\r\n\r\nHamilton and Georges then said, in their report, that they saw from the\r\nfirst that the Governor was resolved to avoid doing anything that might\r\nprevent further differences upon the boundaries. The Governor finally\r\nceased to further discuss the question.\r\n\r\nWhen the four prisoners were tried in Provincial Court they were denied\r\ntheir liberty, lest it should be understood as giving up his Lordship’s\r\nright to the lands in question.\r\n\r\nHamilton then drew up a memorial, citing the unreasonable proceedings of\r\nMaryland and the absolute necessity Pennsylvania would be under for its\r\nown protection. It was a strong argument, but of no avail. They returned\r\nto Philadelphia in disgust.\r\n\r\nThe border troubles grew in intensity and especially when Cresap and his\r\nfollowers were the most active.\r\n\r\nHendricks and Minshall were released at the end of their sentence and\r\nmany of the stirring scenes along the border occurred in the vicinity of\r\ntheir settlements and with them as provincial actors in the drama.\r\n\r\nThe arrest of Cresap put a stop to the local warfare but the survey of\r\nthe Mason and Dixon Line fixed for all time the actual boundary between\r\nthe States.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              General Sullivan Arrives at Easton to Subdue\r\n                       Six Nations, May 26, 1779\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1778 Colonel Thomas Hartley made a successful\r\nexpedition against the Six Nations Indians, marching from Fort Muncy, in\r\npresent Lycoming County, to Tioga, covering 300 miles in two weeks. His\r\narmy destroyed every Indian town, defeated the Indians in each encounter\r\nand brought off much food and Indian goods.\r\n\r\nThe settlers, who had taken flight, now ventured back and harvested\r\ntheir crops, but by spring the Indians had become bolder and more\r\ntreacherous than ever before. The attention of Congress was drawn to\r\nthis distress along the frontier and General Washington was directed to\r\nrelieve the situation.\r\n\r\nThe Commander-in-chief selected Major General John Sullivan, and in\r\nApril, 1779, directed him to prepare for an expedition into the heart of\r\nthe Six Nations’ country. General Washington made no mistake in the\r\nselection of General Sullivan. He proved equal to the stupendous\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sullivan immediately began his preparations, but the real start\r\nof this expedition may properly be considered as of May 26, 1779, when\r\nhe arrived at Easton with his command. General Washington gave him his\r\ndirections in a long and interesting letter of instructions. He told him\r\nthat the expedition he was to command against the hostile tribes of the\r\nSix Nations was to discourage predatory marauds on our frontier\r\nsettlements and to retaliate for the horrible massacres at Wyoming and\r\nCherry Valley, and, “if opportunity favored, for the capture of Niagara\r\nand an invasion into Canada.”\r\n\r\nBut Washington advised him that “the immediate objects are the total\r\ndestruction and devastation of their settlements and the capture of as\r\nmany prisoners of every age and sex as possible. So soon as your\r\npreparations are in sufficient forwardness you will assemble your main\r\nbody at Wyoming and proceed thence to Tioga, taking from that place the\r\nmost direct and practicable route into the heart of the Indian\r\nsettlements.”\r\n\r\nGeneral Sullivan established a rendezvous at Easton, May 26, 1779, and\r\nthen marched to Wyoming, where he experienced a long and tedious wait,\r\ncaused by the failure of both Continental and State authorities to\r\nproperly clothe and provision the army, and the further embarrassment\r\nthat promised re-enforcements were not furnished.\r\n\r\nIn spite of these discouragements, General Sullivan determined to march,\r\nand July 31, 1779, at 1 o’clock in the afternoon, the army left Wyoming\r\non its march up the Susquehanna, accompanied by 120 boats.\r\n\r\nThe army was composed of the following: General Edward Hand’s brigade,\r\nwhich consisted of the light corps, made up of the German Regiment and\r\nthat commanded by Colonel Adam Hubley and the Independent regiments of\r\nColonels Shott and Spalding; and General Maxwell’s brigade, consisting\r\nof four regiments under Colonels Dayton, Shreeve, Ogden, and Spencer;\r\nand General Poor’s brigade, with four regiments under Colonels Cilley,\r\nReed, Scammel and Courland. The second line, or reserves were the\r\ncommands of Colonels Livingston, Dubois, Gainsworth and Olden. Colonel\r\nThomas Proctor’s artillery was also a most important part of this army.\r\n\r\nThe several encampments were made at Lackawanna, then at Quiltimunk,\r\nTunkhannock, Vanderlip’s farm, and Wyalusing, which was reached August\r\n6, when a heavy rain kept the army in camp two days.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, August 8, the army reached Standing Stone, a place which\r\nderives its name from a large stone standing erect in the river. It is\r\ntwenty feet in height, fourteen feet wide and three feet in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe army was forced to go into camp at Standing Stone on account of the\r\nindisposition of General Sullivan and inability to bring up the boats.\r\n\r\nTheir next encampment was at Sheshecununk, and on the following day,\r\nAugust 11, had extreme difficulty fording the river before reaching\r\nTioga Flats, where Queen Esther’s Town stood, until destroyed by Colonel\r\nHartley the previous year.\r\n\r\nIndians were discovered at Chemung, twelve miles distant, and an\r\nexpedition was set in motion to destroy their village. The main army\r\nmarched through the night and arrived at daylight, but the Indians,\r\naware of the advancing army, had evacuated the village, but made a\r\ndetermined stand at Newtown.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sullivan pushed on with great vigor and formed a junction with\r\nGeneral Clinton’s army August 19. On August 29, 1500 Indians, under Joe\r\nBrant and Captain John MacDonald, and the British and Tories, under\r\nColonel John Butler and the two Johnstons, attacked the Americans near\r\nthe scene of the Newtown battle.\r\n\r\nThe enemy was well entrenched, thinking to destroy our army at a narrow\r\ndefile in front of their breastworks. This situation was discovered by\r\nCaptain Parr when Colonel Proctor opened a cannon fire on the enemy, who\r\nretreated to a much stronger position, but too closely pursued by Poor’s\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\nThe Americans charged up the hill with bayonets and poured deadly fire\r\ninto their ranks, driving them from the field. Nine Indians were killed\r\nand left on the ground to be scalped by the troops.\r\n\r\nEvery Indian village was burned and the savages were made to understand\r\nthat the Americans were their masters.\r\n\r\nThe return march was made to Wyoming, where the army arrived October 8.\r\nA great feast on venison and wild turkey was had in honor of their\r\neffective service.\r\n\r\nThe army reached Easton October 15, and Congress set apart October 26,\r\nas a day for a general thanksgiving.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sullivan had shattered his constitution by years of constant\r\nexposure in the field and suffered much from an accident received in\r\nthis campaign, and he was given a leave “as long as he shall judge it\r\nexpedient for the recovery of his health.” He was thanked by Congress\r\nfor his services. During the whole campaign his conduct was\r\ndistinguished by courage, energy and skill.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sullivan could not recover his full vigor and resigned from the\r\narmy at the close of 1779, but was convalescing when elected to\r\nCongress. He went to that body with much reluctance, but his services\r\nthere were as conspicuous and patriotic as they had been on many a\r\nbloody battlefield. He died January 23, 1795.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Patriotic Women Feed Soldiers at Cooper\r\n                        Shop and Union Saloons,\r\n                              May 27, 1861\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the Civil War Philadelphia lay in the channel of the great stream\r\nof volunteers from New England, New York, New Jersey and part of\r\nPennsylvania, that commenced flowing early in May, 1861. Working in\r\ngrand harmony the national and more extended organizations for the\r\nrelief of the soldiers, were houses of refreshment and temporary\r\nhospital accommodations furnished by the citizens of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers crossing New Jersey, and the Delaware River at Camden, were\r\nlanded at the foot of Washington Avenue, where, weary and hungry, they\r\noften sought in vain for sufficient refreshments in the bakeries and\r\ngroceries in the neighborhood before entering the cars for Washington or\r\nother points of rendezvous.\r\n\r\nOne morning the wife of a mechanic living near, commiserating the\r\nsituation of some soldiers who had just arrived, went out with her\r\ncoffee-pot and a cup, and distributed its contents among them. That\r\ngenerous hint was the germ of a wonderful system of relief for the\r\npassing soldiers, which was immediately developed in this patriotic and\r\nhistoric city.\r\n\r\nSoon other benevolent women, living in the vicinity of the landing-place\r\nof the volunteers, imitated their patriotic sister, and a few of them\r\nformed themselves into a committee for the regular distribution of\r\ncoffee on the arrival of soldiers. Soon the men in the neighborhood\r\ninterested themselves in procuring other supplies.\r\n\r\nThe women who formed this original committee were Mrs. William M.\r\nCooper, Mrs. Grace Nickles, Mrs. Sarah Ewing, Mrs. Elizabeth Vansdale,\r\nMrs. Catherine Vansdale, Mrs. Jane Coward, Mrs. Susan Turner, Mrs. Sarah\r\nMellen, Mrs. Catherine Alexander, Mrs. Mary Plant, and Mrs. Captain\r\nWatson.\r\n\r\nFor a few days the refreshments were dispensed under the shade of trees\r\nin front of the cooper shop owned by William M. Cooper and Henry W.\r\nPearce, on Otsego Street near Washington Avenue. Then this shop was\r\ngenerously offered for the purpose by the proprietors, and immediately\r\nit was equipped with tables and such kitchen arrangements as were\r\nnecessary to prepare such foods as was supplied by the voluntary\r\ncontributions raised among the citizens of Philadelphia. The young\r\nwomen, wives and daughters of those resident in the neighborhood waited\r\nupon the soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe first body of troops fed at the saloon was the Eighth New York\r\nRegiment, called the German Rifles, under Colonel Blenker. There were\r\n780 men who partook of a coffee breakfast there on the morning of May\r\n27, 1861.\r\n\r\nThe cooper shop was not spacious enough to accommodate the daily\r\nincreasing number of soldiers, and another place of refreshment was\r\nopened on the corner of Washington Avenue and Swanson Street, in a\r\nbuilding formerly used as a boathouse and rigger’s loft. Two Volunteer\r\nRefreshment Saloon Committees were formed and known respectively as the\r\n“Cooper Shop” and the “Union.”\r\n\r\nBoth were in effective working order on May 27. The following were the\r\nprincipal officers of the two associations, respectively: The Cooper\r\nShop: President, William M. Cooper; vice president, C. V. Fort;\r\ntreasurer, Adam M. Simpson; secretaries, William M. Maull and E. S.\r\nHall. The Union: Chairman, Arad Barrows; secretary, J. B. Wade;\r\ntreasurer, B. S. Brown; steward, J. T. Williams.\r\n\r\nThese two organizations worked in harmony and generous rivalry all\r\nthrough the period of the war and rendered wonderful service. Both\r\nsaloons were enlarged as necessity required and both had temporary\r\nhospitals attached to them. These were used for such soldiers who were\r\nsick or wounded and who were unable to leave Philadelphia and who\r\nrequired rest or nursing and medical attendance to restore them to\r\nhealth and duty.\r\n\r\nCooper Hospital was under the charge of Dr. Andrew Nebinger, assisted by\r\nhis brother, Dr. George Nebinger, and Miss Anna M. Ross. After the death\r\nof Miss Ross, Mrs. Abigail Horner became the lady principal of the\r\n“Cooper Shop Hospital.”\r\n\r\nDr. Eliab Ward had charge of the “Union Hospital.” He gave his services\r\nthroughout the war free of charge. Nearly 11,000 sick and wounded\r\nsoldiers were nursed and received medical attention at this hospital,\r\nand nearly twice that number had their wounds dressed, and more than\r\n40,000 had a night’s lodging.\r\n\r\nAn accurate record was kept of all the operations of the “Union Saloon,”\r\nwhich show that 800,000 soldiers were received and 1,025,000 meals were\r\nfurnished, and the total amount of money expended being $98,204.34, and\r\nfor materials used there was expended $30,000, a grand total of\r\n$128,204.34, all of which was received by voluntary contributions.\r\n\r\nThe women who devoted themselves to the service of preparing the meals\r\nand waiting upon this vast host deserve the choicest blessings of their\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAt all hours of the day and night these self-sacrificing heroines, when\r\na little signal gun employed for the purpose announced the approach of a\r\ntrain bearing soldiers, would repair to their saloons and cheerfully\r\ndispense their generous bounties.\r\n\r\nThe little cannon used as a signal had a notable history. It was part of\r\nthe ordnance in the army of General Taylor on the Rio Grande in 1846,\r\nwhere it was captured, only to be recaptured by a United States cruiser.\r\n\r\nThe last regiment of soldiers fed in either of these saloons was the\r\n104th Pennsylvania, Colonel Kephart, numbering 748 men, on August 28,\r\n1865.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Colonel William Clapham and Family Murdered\r\n                        by Indians, May 28, 1763\r\n\r\n\r\nColonel William Clapham was an English officer who rendered conspicuous\r\nservice on the frontiers of Pennsylvania and who, like many others, paid\r\nthe price with his scalp in the uneven warfare waged by the Indians and\r\ntheir French allies.\r\n\r\nWilliam Clapham was born in England July 5, 1722, and after graduating\r\nfrom college, entered the army as an ensign. He was sent to America\r\nduring the French and Indian War. He subsequently resigned his\r\ncommission and took up his residence in Philadelphia, where he was\r\nliving at the time of Braddock’s defeat.\r\n\r\nThis disaster to the English arms caused Captain Clapham to again offer\r\nhis services, this time to the Province of Pennsylvania. He was\r\ncommissioned a captain and sent by Governor Morris into Bucks County to\r\nrecruit troops and to muster into the Provincial service the company\r\nrecruited by Captain Insley, who were ordered to join the regular troops\r\nthen posted at Reading and Easton.\r\n\r\nWhile Captain Clapham was on this tour of duty he journeyed to Fort\r\nAllen to make a visit with some friends. The Assembly at this moment was\r\npressing Colonel Benjamin Franklin to return to his seat in that body.\r\nThe three forts being completed, and the inhabitants willing to remain\r\non their plantations with soldiers in these garrisons, Colonel Franklin\r\nplaced Captain Clapham in full command and departed.\r\n\r\nThis was only a temporary command, but Governor Morris, March 29, 1756,\r\ncommissioned him lieutenant-colonel, and assigned him to the Third\r\nBattalion. He also ordered the Colonel to assemble his troops as soon as\r\npossible at Hunter’s Mill, preparatory to marching to Shamokin (now\r\nSunbury), where he was to build a substantial fort.\r\n\r\nColonel Clapham recruited 400 men for that purpose. He assembled his\r\nforce at Fort Hunter, where he began training them. Before they marched\r\nfrom this encampment Governor Morris paid them an official visit, the\r\nincidents of which are quite entertaining and very interesting.\r\n\r\nColonel Clapham marched his command to Armstrongs, built Fort Halifax,\r\nstationed a garrison there, and finally proceeded up the river to\r\nShamokin, where he arrived July 1, and immediately set about building\r\nFort Augusta. This formidable fortress was finished in October.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning of this frontier service Colonel Clapham\r\nexperienced no end of trouble with his officers. He seems to have been\r\noverbearing and a hard taskmaster. He bore many insults, as he termed\r\nthem, from the Assembly. These frequent disputes and misunderstandings\r\nwith his officers wore out his patience and he resigned in November,\r\n1756, being succeeded by Major James Burd of Lancaster.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the confusion and ill-feeling which prevailed among the\r\nofficers and men during the building of Fort Augusta, it seems that a\r\nsecret directing power had prevented everything from falling into chaos\r\nand much good was accomplished. Had it not been for this unseen power,\r\nthe fort would have been captured by the French and Indians and the\r\nwhole North and West Branch Valleys would have been overrun and held by\r\nthe enemy at this most critical period in the history of the Province.\r\n\r\nHe was a most conspicuous figure on the early frontiers. Even Colonel\r\nClapham’s enemies, or those who thought he was not an acceptable\r\nofficer, must have been moved to deep and sincere sympathy when they\r\nlearned the sad fate which so soon afterward befell him and his family\r\non the western frontier of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nHe did not long remain out of the service when his resignation as\r\ncommander of the garrison at Fort Augusta was accepted. In 1763 he was\r\nan active officer in the expedition of Colonel Henry Bouquet on the\r\nwestern frontier of the Province.\r\n\r\nHe was in command of a formidable scouting party when he was murdered on\r\nSewickley Creek, near where the town of West Newton now stands.\r\n\r\nThis tragedy occurred on the afternoon of May 28, 1763, and was\r\ncommitted by The Wolf, Kektuscung and two other Indians, one of whom was\r\ncalled Butler.\r\n\r\nColonel Clapham had taken his family to this frontier, and was very near\r\nhis own home when these Indians shot him from ambush, rushed into his\r\nhouse, killed and scalped his wife and three children and a woman. The\r\ntwo women were treated with brutal indecency. They left evidences of the\r\nfact that they were paying an old score with Colonel Clapham, and the\r\nscene was horrible to behold.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the murder of the Claphams, three men who were working at\r\nsome distance from the Clapham house escaped through the woods and\r\ncarried the terrible news to the garrison in Fort Pitt.\r\n\r\nTwo soldiers, who were in Colonel Clapham’s detail, and stationed at a\r\nsawmill near the fort, were killed and scalped by these same Indians.\r\n\r\nIt seems that there were others slain in this massacre for Colonel Burd\r\nentered in his journal, June 5, 1763, that “John Harris gave me an\r\naccount of Colonel Clapham and twelve men being killed near Pittsburgh,\r\nand two Royal Americans being killed at the saw mill.”\r\n\r\nColonel Bouquet in a letter to General Amherst, dated Fort Pitt, May 31,\r\n1763, says: “We have most melancholy reports here * * * the Indians have\r\nbroke out in several places, and murdered Colonel Clapham and his\r\nfamily.”\r\n\r\nJudge Jasper Yeates made a visit to Braddock’s battlefield in August,\r\n1776, and then to the site of Fort Pitt. He remarked about seeing the\r\ngrave of Colonel Clapham.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the family became extinct after the Indians\r\nperpetrated their dastardly crime, and the ashes of the famous commander\r\nand builder of Fort Augusta have long since mingled with the soil.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Free Society of Traders Organized with Aid\r\n                         of Penn, May 29, 1682\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon as William Penn received the grant of land in America which is now\r\nPennsylvania, he immediately issued advertisements in which certain\r\nconcessions were offered to settlers. Among those who made application\r\nfor large quantities of land were companies organized for colonization\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nOne such company was “The Free Society of Traders,” whose plans Penn\r\nfavored and whose constitution and charter he helped to draw.\r\n\r\nThe first general court of this society was held in London May 29, 1682,\r\nat which time the “Articles, Settlement and Offices” of the society were\r\nadopted and the actual operations begun.\r\n\r\nThe charter to the Pennsylvania Company, the Free Society of Traders,\r\nbears date March 24, 1862. The incorporators named in Penn’s deed to\r\nthem were “Nicholas More, of London, medical doctor; James Claypoole,\r\nmerchant; Philip Ford (Penn’s unworthy steward); William Sherloe, of\r\nLondon, merchant; Edward Pierce, of London, leather seller; John Symcock\r\nand Thomas Brassey, of Cheshire, yeoman; Thomas Barker, of London, wine\r\ncooper, and Edward Brookes, of London, grocer.”\r\n\r\nThe deed recites Penn’s authority under his patent, mentions the\r\nconveyance to the company of 20,000 acres in Philadelphia, erects this\r\ntract into the manor of Frank, “in free and common Socage, by such\r\nrents, customs and services, as to them and their successors shall seem\r\nmeet, so as to be consistent with said tenure.” It allowed them two\r\njustices’ courts a year and other legal privileges.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the first 20,000 acres, their appurtenant city lots “was\r\nan entire street, and one side of a street from river to river,”\r\ncomprising 100 acres, exclusive of an additional 400 acres owned in the\r\nLiberties. The location of the property was the tract between Spruce and\r\nPine streets, from the Delaware to the Schuylkill River, 366 feet in\r\nwidth. Their lands were given the name Society Hill.\r\n\r\nThe society was empowered to appoint and remove its officers and\r\nservants, to levy taxes, etc. An important privilege was the authority\r\ngiven to be represented in the Provincial Council by three\r\nrepresentatives of the society.\r\n\r\nThis society was given title to three-fifths of the products of all\r\nmines and minerals found, free privilege to fish in all waters of the\r\nProvince, and to establish fairs, markets, etc., and the books of the\r\nsociety were to be exempted from all inspection.\r\n\r\nMay 29, 1682, the general court prepared and published an address, and\r\nmapped out an ambitious program of operations.\r\n\r\nThe address, which is ingenuous, points to the fact that while it\r\nproposes to employ the principles of the association in order to conduct\r\na large business, it is no monopoly, but an absolutely free society in a\r\nfree country. “It is,” says the prospectus, “an enduring estate, and a\r\nlasting as well as certain credit; a portion and inheritance that is\r\nclear and growing, free from the mischief of frauds and false\r\nsecurities, supported by the concurrent strength and care of a great and\r\nprudent body, a kind of perpetual trustees, the friends of the widow and\r\norphan, for it takes no advantages of minority or simplicity.”\r\n\r\nIn the society votes were to be on a basis of amount of stock held, up\r\nto three votes, which was the limit. No one in England was allowed more\r\nthan a single vote, and proxies could be voted. The officers were\r\npresident, deputy, treasurer, secretary and twelve committeemen. Five,\r\nwith president or deputy a quorum. The officers were to live on the\r\nsociety’s property.\r\n\r\nAll the society’s servants were bound to secrecy, and the books were\r\nkept in the society’s house, under three locks, the keys in charge of\r\nthe president, treasurer and oldest committeeman, and not to be\r\nentrusted to any persons longer than to transcribe any part in daytime\r\nand in the house, before seven persons appointed by the committee.\r\n\r\nThe society was to send 200 servants to Pennsylvania the first year, “to\r\nbuild two or more general factories in Pennsylvania, one upon Chesapeake\r\nBay, and the other upon Delaware River, or where else the committee\r\nshall see necessary for the more speedy conveyance of goods in the\r\ncountry and Maryland, but that the government of the whole be in the\r\nCapital City of Pennsylvania.”\r\n\r\nThe society was to aid Indians in building houses, etc., and to hold\r\nNegroes for fourteen years’ service, when they were to go free “on\r\ngiving to the society two-thirds of what they can produce on land\r\nallotted to them by the society, with a stock and tools; if they agree\r\nnot to this, to be servants till they do.”\r\n\r\nThe leading object of the society at the outset seems to have been an\r\nextensive free trade with the Indians, agriculture, establishment of\r\nmanufactories, for carrying on the lumber trade and whale fishing. An\r\nagent in London was to sell the goods.\r\n\r\nNicholas More, president of the society and one of Penn’s Judges, was\r\nthe first purchaser of land in the province who had a manor granted to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe Free Society of Traders obtained land on the river front south of\r\nDock Creek. The society built a sawmill and a glasshouse, both in the\r\nsame year, 1683. They also established a tannery, which was well\r\nsupplied with bark and hides. Leather was in general use for articles of\r\nclothing, such as are now made of other goods. Penn himself wore leather\r\nstockings.\r\n\r\nIn 1695 the exportation of dressed and undressed deerskins was\r\nprohibited in order to promote their utilization at home.\r\n\r\nBut as the people arrived and settled they probably found they could do\r\nbetter by themselves than in a company and its schemes were not carried\r\nout. So the Free Society of Traders, from which much had been expected\r\nand which actually yielded so little, came to an end March 2, 1723, when\r\nan act of Assembly placed its property into the hands of trustees for\r\nsale to pay its debts.\r\n\r\nThe trustees appointed were Charles Reed, Job Goodson, Evan Owen, George\r\nFitzwater and Joseph Pigeon, merchants of Philadelphia. These soon\r\ndisposed of the property.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Davy, the Lame Indian, Surrenders at Fort\r\n                           Pitt, May 30, 1783\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the morning of May 30, 1783, an Indian was discovered sitting on\r\na porch in Pittsburgh, holding in his hand a light pole.\r\n\r\nWhen a girl of the household responded to his alarm he asked her in\r\nbroken English for milk. She told members of the family that the Indian\r\nwas a mere skeleton and they appeared on the porch and found him so thin\r\nand emaciated that they could scarcely detect any flesh upon his bones.\r\nOne of his limbs had been wounded, and the pole had been used as a sort\r\nof crutch.\r\n\r\nOn being questioned, he appeared too weak to give much of an account of\r\nhimself, but drank of the milk. Word was immediately sent to General\r\nWilliam Irvine, commandant of the garrison of Fort Pitt, who sent a\r\nguard and had him taken to the fort.\r\n\r\nWhen questioned, he said that he had been trapping along Beaver River,\r\nand had a difference with a Mingo Indian who shot him in the leg,\r\nbecause he had said he wished to come to the white people. This story\r\nwas not believed, especially by some who thought they recognized him as\r\nan Indian known as Davy. He was told to tell the truth, he would fare\r\nbetter, and he gave an account of the attack on the Walthour settlement,\r\nApril 24, in which the following facts were related:\r\n\r\nFive or six men were working in Christopher Walthour’s field, about\r\neight miles west of the present Greensburg. Among the workers was a\r\nson-in-law, named Willard, whose daughter, sixteen years old, was\r\ncarrying water to the men.\r\n\r\nThe workers were surprised by the appearance of a band of Delaware who\r\ncaptured the girl. The men reached their guns, which were a short\r\ndistance away, and made a running fight as they retired toward the fort.\r\nOld man Walthour and Willard were killed, the latter falling not far\r\nfrom the stockade. An Indian rushed out of the bushes to scalp Willard,\r\nand was just in the act of twisting his fingers in the white man’s long\r\nhair, when a well-directed rifle shot, fired from the fort, struck the\r\nsavage in the leg, who gave a horrid yell and made off toward the woods,\r\nleaving his gun beside his victim.\r\n\r\nAs soon as a band of frontiersmen could be collected they pursued the\r\nIndians, following their trail as far as the Allegheny River.\r\n\r\nAlmost two months after the attack the badly decomposed body of the\r\nWillard girl was found in the woods not far from Negley’s Run. Her head\r\nhad been crushed in with a tomahawk and her scalp was gone.\r\n\r\nThe lame Indian after relating many horrid details told that he lay\r\nthree days without moving from the first place he threw himself in the\r\nbushes fearing pursuit; then he crawled on hands and one foot until he\r\nfound the pole in a marsh, which he used to assist him, and in the\r\nmeantime lived on berries and roots. He lay all day on a hill\r\noverlooking a garrison of militiamen, thinking of giving himself up, but\r\nas they were not regulars he did not venture. Driven to desperation by\r\nhunger, he decided to make his way to Fort Pitt, and give himself up to\r\nregular soldiers.\r\n\r\nDavy was confined in the guard house in the fort, but the news of his\r\ncapture and his identity reached the settlement of Brush Creek and\r\ncaused considerable excitement there.\r\n\r\nKindred and friends of the victims were hot for revenge and the chance\r\npresented itself. Mrs. Mary Willard, the widow of the man Davy killed\r\nand mother of the girl killed and scalped by his companions, accompanied\r\nby a deputation of her neighbors, arrived at Fort Pitt and asked General\r\nIrvine to deliver up the prisoner.\r\n\r\nAt first the request was refused, but when the body of the Willard girl\r\nwas afterward found, a mass-meeting was held and a committee chosen to\r\ngo to Fort Pitt and renew negotiations with General Irvine for the\r\nsurrender of Davy.\r\n\r\nAfter much deliberation, General Irvine yielded to the pleadings of the\r\ncommittee and surrendered the prisoner. The order of General Irvine to\r\nthe frontiersmen was as follows: “You are hereby enjoined and required\r\nto take the Indian delivered into your charge by my order and carry him\r\nsafe into the settlement of Brush Creek. You will afterward warn two\r\njustices of the peace and request their attendance at such times as they\r\nshall think proper to appoint, with several other reputable inhabitants.\r\nUntil this is done and their advise and direction had in the matter you\r\nare, at your peril, not to hurt him, nor suffer any person to do it.\r\nGiven under my hand at Fort Pitt, July 21, 1782.\r\n\r\n                                                   “WILLIAM IRVINE.”\r\n\r\nThe general also sent a note to Mrs. Willard, in which he urged her to\r\ndo nothing rash in retaliating her vengeance on the prisoner, and not to\r\npermit him to be put to death until after “some form of trial.”\r\n\r\nThe intention of the frontiersmen was to summon a jury of their\r\nneighbors and try him, at least to comply with the General’s orders. But\r\nthe fact he was an Indian would be sufficient evidence to condemn him,\r\neven if the wounded leg was not added evidence. In event of conviction\r\nhe was to suffer death in regular Indian fashion, by torture and\r\nburning.\r\n\r\nOn arrival at Walthour’s, Davy was confined in a log blockhouse for two\r\ndays and three nights, while the neighbors and magistrates could\r\nassemble for the trial and execution.\r\n\r\nWhile a few were guarding the prisoner, some were in quest of the\r\nneighbors and others collected wood and materials for the burning, which\r\nit was already determined should be at the identical spot where he had\r\nreceived his wound while in the act of scalping Willard.\r\n\r\nOn the night preceding the great day the guard was somewhat careless\r\nand, realizing their prisoner was a bad cripple, they joined rather\r\nenthusiastically in the preparations for the execution.\r\n\r\nOn arising in the morning the blockhouse was empty. The guards were\r\naroused and an investigation revealed the guardhouse door securely\r\nlocked. No human being could get through the loopholes. It was found the\r\nonly possible way of escape was through the narrow space between the\r\noverjutting roof and the top of the wall, and through this he must have\r\nescaped.\r\n\r\nBitter was their disappointment, when they learned their prey had\r\nescaped. In every direction eager searching parties ranged the country,\r\nbut no trace of the wounded Delaware. The hunt continued for two days,\r\nbut Davy had made good his escape and saved himself from the warm\r\nreception which awaited him later in the day.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Thousands of Lives Lost in Johnstown\r\n                          Flood, May 31, 1889\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen an avalanche of water swept down the Conemaugh Valley destroying\r\neverything in its descent, including the thriving city of Johnstown,\r\ncontaining thirty thousand souls, many great industrial establishments\r\nwere nearly wiped from the earth, many thousands were drowned or burned\r\nto death, and property worth many millions was destroyed. This disaster\r\nwas so far beyond all experience that it is difficult for the mind to\r\ngrasp it.\r\n\r\nJohnstown was a community of seven or eight towns with a combined\r\npopulation of quite thirty thousand souls. It is situated in a deep\r\nvalley where the Little Conemaugh River and Stony Creek unite to form\r\nthe Conemaugh River.\r\n\r\nEarly on Friday, May 31, 1889, a freshet in Stony Creek broke away the\r\nboom above the town and swept down the mass of logs against the\r\ninundated houses.\r\n\r\nThis was followed in the afternoon by a far worse disaster, when the dam\r\nof the South Fork Lake broke and the mass of water swept down the\r\nvalley, carrying everything before it. The logs and wreckage piled\r\nagainst the bridge, forming a partial dam, that raised the water level\r\nstill higher, and in a short time the whole town was submerged.\r\n\r\nHundreds were drowned in their houses, others were swept along by the\r\ntorrent and perished either by water or by fire among the debris.\r\nNothing in the history of the United States in time of peace ever\r\napproached this appalling catastrophe.\r\n\r\nConemaugh Lake was a body of water about three and a half miles long,\r\none and a quarter miles in width, and in some places one hundred feet in\r\ndepth. It was located on the mountain some three or four hundred feet\r\nabove the level of Johnstown and was, of course, a menace to that city.\r\nIt was believed to hold more water than any reservoir in America. This\r\nlake was the property of some wealthy sportsmen of Pittsburgh and\r\nelsewhere, members of the South Fork Hunting and Fishing Club.\r\n\r\nEvery known precaution had been taken to insure the safety of the\r\nreservoir. An inspection was made monthly by competent engineers, and it\r\nwas believed nothing less than some extraordinary freak of nature could\r\ndestroy the barrier that held this large body of water in check. These\r\nwaters were held in bounds by a dam nearly one thousand feet wide, more\r\nthan one hundred feet high and ninety feet in thickness at the base.\r\n\r\nThe streams were already unusually swollen, when a heavy downpour of\r\nrain fell steadily for forty-eight hours which increased the volume of\r\nwater in all the mountain streams. In fact, the entire State suffered\r\nfrom floods. The regions along the West Branch of the Susquehanna, the\r\nLehigh, the Juniata and the Conemaugh Rivers were the principal scenes\r\nof desolation.\r\n\r\nThe water in the South Fork Lake rose slowly until it poured over the\r\ntop of the big dam, and then some of the old leakages became larger,\r\nthen the breast broke, and sixteen million tons of water rushed forth\r\nlike a demon.\r\n\r\nJohn Baker, the Paul Revere of the occasion, rode a race with it for a\r\nwhile and saved many people, but the death-dealing torrent laden with\r\ntrees, houses, wreckage and human beings, defied even steam whistles and\r\ntelegraph instruments.\r\n\r\nThe water plowed through South Fork, Mineral Point, Franklin, East\r\nConemaugh, Woodvale, Conemaugh, Johnstown, Kernville, Millville and\r\nCambria.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the afternoon and the night that followed was one of\r\nunutterable agony. Darkness added to the terror of the situation.\r\n\r\nThe wreckage could not pass through the big stone bridge. That caused\r\nthe water to back up and flood the city, but soon a channel was made\r\nwhich cut through the heart of Johnstown. This caused the terrible\r\ndestruction of life and property that was incurred at Cambria Iron\r\nWorks.\r\n\r\nThen came the flames to make the calamity more appalling. Hundreds of\r\nhouses had been piled up against the stone bridge, the inmates of but a\r\nfew being able to escape; these took fire and many hundreds of souls\r\nperished in them. Men, women and children, held down by timbers, watched\r\nwith indescribable agony the flames creep surely toward them, and they\r\nwere slowly roasted to death.\r\n\r\nThere were many instances of personal heroism and self-sacrifice in\r\nwhich many persons were saved from drowning or being burned to death.\r\nThere were many cases of most remarkable escapes, and not a few\r\ninstances of heroic rescue, which a moment later were rendered useless\r\nby another catastrophe in which both hero and victim lost their lives.\r\nEdward C. Will is credited with saving twenty-two lives.\r\n\r\nGovernor Beaver issued a proclamation, calling upon the people for their\r\nbenefactions. Adjutant General Hastings was promptly on the scene and\r\npersonally directed the patrol, composed of the Fourteenth Regiment and\r\none company of the Fifth Regiment of the National Guard.\r\n\r\nGovernor Beaver appointed a Flood Relief Commission to distribute a fund\r\nwhich had been raised from every section of the State and all over the\r\ncountry. The fund exceeded $3,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe State Board of Health was early on the ground to enforce the\r\nsanitary laws. The debris was removed as promptly as possible, and\r\nhealthful conditions were soon restored.\r\n\r\nTo pay the State’s expenses, generous men of means advanced the money\r\ntill the Legislature would reimburse them. There never was a more\r\nbeautiful example of public and private charity in all history.\r\n\r\nThe loss of lives was 2,235, or more, and the property loss exceeded\r\n$10,000,000 in value.\r\n\r\nThe people of Johnstown, although prostrated by their misfortune, soon\r\nrecovered, rebuilt their city and re-established their industrial\r\nplants, making it a more beautiful and more modern place than ever\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               General John Bull, Officer of Province and\r\n                       the Continental Army, Born\r\n                              June 1, 1731\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral John Bull was one of the distinguished patriots of the Province\r\nand State and a veteran of the French and Indian War, a trusted agent of\r\nthe Proprietaries to the Indians, an early adherent of the colonists, a\r\nmember of the first Constitutional Convention, an officer of troops and\r\nbuilder of forts, a member of the Board of War and of the General\r\nAssembly, a prominent citizen in every particular, yet one of whose life\r\nlittle is known.\r\n\r\nJohn Bull was born in Providence Township, now Montgomery County, June\r\n1, 1731, and spent his early life in that immediate neighborhood.\r\n\r\nHis active military life began May 12, 1758, when he was commissioned\r\ncaptain in the Provincial service, and with his command was on duty at\r\nFort Allen, now Weissport, Carbon County.\r\n\r\nLater in that year he commanded a company in the expedition led by\r\nGeneral John Forbes, for the reduction of Fort DuQuesne, and during this\r\ntour of duty he rendered most conspicuous service in negotiations with\r\nthe Indians.\r\n\r\nThis treaty was attended by Governor Bernard of New Jersey, who had come\r\nprincipally to demand of the Munsee that they keep a treaty promise by\r\nwhich they were to deliver captives taken from his province.\r\n\r\nThe treaty ended at Easton, October 24, when mutual releases were\r\nexecuted; Pisquitomen and Thomas Hickman, an Ohio Indian, were sent back\r\nto the Ohio to bear assurance of pardon, and invitations to those\r\nwestern Indians to come to Philadelphia. Captain John Bull and William\r\nHayes and Isaac Still, the interpreter, and two Indians of the Six\r\nNations, one of whom was John Shikellamy, accompanied them. The mission\r\nwas wholly successful.\r\n\r\nIn 1771 Captain Bull owned the Norris plantation and mill, and resided\r\nthere on the site of the present Norristown, then called Norriton.\r\n\r\nHe was a delegate to the Provincial Conference of January 23, 1775, and\r\nof June 18, 1775.\r\n\r\nOn July 8, 1776, the day of the reading of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, an election was held at the State House for members of the\r\nConvention to form a Constitution for the State. Those elected from\r\nPhiladelphia County were Frederic Antes, Henry Hill, Robert Loller,\r\nJoseph Blewer, John Bull, Thomas Potts, Edward Bartholomew, and William\r\nCoats.\r\n\r\nCaptain Bull was elected a member of the Board of War, March 14, 1777.\r\n\r\nCongress asked in October, 1775, that a battalion from Pennsylvania be\r\nraised to take part in the expedition against Canada. John Bull was\r\nappointed its colonel, but resigned January 20, 1776, owing to a threat\r\nof about half the officers to do so if he continued in command, so John\r\nPhilip DeHaas, of Lebanon, was appointed.\r\n\r\nColonel Bull was one of the commissioners at the Indian Treaty held at\r\nEaston January 30, 1777.\r\n\r\nAt the election held February 14, 1777, Colonel Bull was one of four\r\nelected to the Assembly.\r\n\r\nAfter the evacuation of Philadelphia by the British, Colonel Bull was\r\nsent to Mud Island, with workmen and laborers, to repair the banks and\r\nsluices and complete barracks sufficient for the garrison.\r\n\r\nOn May 2, 1777, he was appointed colonel of the First State Regiment of\r\nFoot, and on July 16 was commissioned Adjutant-General of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nIn October of this year his barns, barracks, grain, and hay were burned\r\nby the British, and his wagons, horses, cattle, sheep and Negroes\r\ncarried off, although General Howe had given his word to Mrs. Bull that\r\nthey would not be disturbed.\r\n\r\nIn December, when General James Irvine was captured, General Bull\r\nsucceeded to the command of the Second Brigade of Pennsylvania militia,\r\nunder General John Armstrong.\r\n\r\nWhile the British were in possession of Philadelphia a brigade of\r\nContinental troops under Colonel John Bull on the evening of December\r\n24, 1777, made an excursion into Fourth Street in Philadelphia, with two\r\nthousand militia, and three pieces of cannon, and alarmed the city by\r\nfiring off the heavy guns, whereby some of the balls fell about old\r\nChrist Church. Colonel Bull then made a good retreat back to his\r\nstation, without the loss of a man.\r\n\r\nDuring 1778 and 1779 he was engaged in erecting defenses for\r\nPhiladelphia and in latter year he put down the chevaux de frize in the\r\nDelaware to obstruct the approach of British ships. In 1780 he served as\r\nCommissary of Purchase at Philadelphia, and appears to have been one of\r\nthe busiest and most indefatigable of workers.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1785 he removed to Northumberland, being attracted there by\r\nthe location of the town and the belief that it would become a large\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nIn 1802 he was a candidate for the Legislature but was defeated by Simon\r\nSnyder, afterwards Governor of the State. In 1805 General Bull was\r\nelected to the General Assembly, but in 1808 he was defeated for\r\nCongress when he ran as the Federalist candidate.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mary Bull, his wife, died February 23, 1811, aged eighty years. The\r\nNorthumberland Argus says, “She was buried in the Quaker graveyard, and\r\nGeneral Bull, though much reduced by sickness and old age, previous to\r\nthe grave being closed, addressed the people as follows: 'The Lord gave\r\nand the Lord hath taken away, blessed be the name of the Lord; may we\r\nwho are soon to follow be as well prepared as she was.'”\r\n\r\nGeneral Bull died August 9, 1824, in the 94th year of his age.\r\n\r\nThis distinguished patriot and citizen lies buried beside his wife in\r\nthe Riverside Cemetery, Northumberland, where a monument should be\r\nerected in memory of this distinguished, yet eccentric, officer of the\r\nFrench and Indian and Revolutionary Wars.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Liberty Bell Hung in Old State House on\r\n                              June 2, 1753\r\n\r\n\r\nThough not the largest nor yet the oldest, but to all Americans by far\r\nthe most celebrated bell is the grand old “Liberty Bell,” whose tones on\r\nJuly 4, 1776, proclaimed the birthday of our Nation.\r\n\r\nThis historic bell was originally cast in London, in 1752, for the State\r\nHouse in Philadelphia. There it hung in the belfry of Independence Hall\r\nuntil July 8, 1835, when it cracked while tolling the news of the death\r\nof John Marshall, Chief Justice of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn the Centennial year, 1876, a new bell, modeled after the original\r\nLiberty Bell, was made by an American bell founder for the tower of the\r\nold State House, or Independence Hall.\r\n\r\nIt weighs 13,000 pounds to represent the thirteen original States, and\r\ncarries in addition to the decoration of the old Liberty Bell, a border\r\nof stars and the additional inscription: “Glory to God and on earth\r\npeace, good will toward men.”\r\n\r\nThe story of the original bell begins in the year 1749, when the tower\r\nwas erected on the south side of the main building of the State House.\r\nThe superintendents were ordered to proceed as soon as they conveniently\r\nmight, and the tower was to contain “the staircase with a suitable place\r\ntherein for hanging a bell.”\r\n\r\nA year later the House adopted a resolution directing “that the\r\nsuperintendents provide a bell of such weight and dimensions as they\r\nshall think suitable.” Isaac Norris, Thomas Leech and Edward Warner\r\naccordingly prepared a letter, which is interesting as it is the\r\ncommencement of proceedings which resulted in the casting of what was\r\nafterward known as the “Liberty Bell.” The letter follows:\r\n\r\n“To Robert Charles, of London, Nov. 1, 1751. Respected Friend.—The\r\nAssembly having ordered us (the superintendents of the State House) to\r\nprocure a bell from England, to be purchased for their use, we take the\r\nliberty to apply ourselves to thee to get us a good bell of about two\r\nthousand weight, the cost of which we presume may amount to about one\r\nhundred pounds sterling, or perhaps more with the charges, etc.\r\n\r\n“We hope and rely on thy care and assistance in this affair, and that\r\nthou will procure and forward it by the first opportunity, as our\r\nworkmen inform us it will be less trouble to hang the bell before their\r\nscaffolds are struck from the building where we intend to place it,\r\nwhich will not be done until the end of next summer or beginning of the\r\nfall. Let the bell be cast by the best workmen, and examine it carefully\r\nbefore it is shipped with the following words, well shaped, in long\r\nletters around it, viz.:\r\n\r\n“‘By order of the Assembly of the Province of Pennsylvania, for the\r\nState House in the city of Philadelphia, 1752.’\r\n\r\n“and underneath.—'Proclaim Liberty through all the land unto all the\r\ninhabitants thereof.—Levit. xxv. 10.'”\r\n\r\nThe bell was brought over in the ship Matilda, Captain Budden, and was\r\nunloaded on the wharf in Philadelphia about the end of August, 1752.\r\n\r\nIt was hung in position and when given its trial for sound “it was\r\ncracked by a stroke of the clapper, without any other violence.”\r\nNeedless to state, the superintendents were disappointed and they\r\ndetermined to ship the bell back to England to be recast. But Captain\r\nBudden had already too heavy a cargo to carry the bell.\r\n\r\nIn this emergency two Philadelphians, Pass and Stow, undertook to recast\r\nit, using the material in the original bell. The mold was opened March\r\n10, 1753. The work had been well done, even the letters being better\r\nthan those on the first bell.\r\n\r\nPass and Stow first cast several small bells to test the quality of the\r\nmaterial, and its sound, and found that there was too much copper in the\r\nmixture. It was their third mixture which was finally used.\r\n\r\nA newspaper of June 7, 1753, carried this notice: “Last week was raised\r\nand fixed in the State House steeple the new great bell cast here by\r\nPass and Stow, weighing 2080 pounds with this motto: ‘Proclaim Liberty\r\nto all the land and all the inhabitants thereof.’.” It was tested June 2\r\nand proved satisfactory.\r\n\r\nOn July 8, 1776, the Declaration of Independence was read in the State\r\nHouse yard. At the same time the King’s Arms were taken from the court\r\nroom and publicly burned, while merry chimes from the church steeples\r\nand peals from the State House bell “proclaimed liberty throughout the\r\nland.”\r\n\r\nThis was an event which made the inscription on the bell prophetic. John\r\nAdams, in writing to Samuel Chase on July 9, said, “The bells rang all\r\nday and almost all night.”\r\n\r\nThe British success on the Brandywine caused great consternation in\r\nPhiladelphia. On September 15, 1777, the Supreme Executive Council\r\nordered “the bells of Christ Church and St. Peter’s as well as the State\r\nHouse to be taken down and removed to a place of safety.” The church\r\nbells were sunk in the river or carried away, but the Liberty Bell, with\r\nten others, was loaded on wagons and hauled via Bethlehem to Allentown.\r\nIn Bethlehem the wagon bearing the State House bell broke down, and it\r\nhad to be reloaded and, when Allentown was reached, the bell was hidden\r\nunder the floor of Zion Reformed Church.\r\n\r\nAfter the evacuation of Philadelphia by the British Army these bells\r\nwere brought back, and the State House bell was placed in its old\r\nposition in the latter part of 1778.\r\n\r\nThe “Liberty Bell” became a venerated object, and it was tacitly\r\ndetermined that it should only be rung on special occasions of\r\nrejoicing, or to commemorate some event of public importance. It was\r\ntolled in 1828 upon the news of the emancipation of the Catholics by act\r\nof the British Parliament. It celebrated the centennial anniversary of\r\nthe birthday of Washington, February 22, 1832.\r\n\r\nBut an end was put to its usefulness for sound early in the morning of\r\nJuly 8, 1835. The break was at first only about eight inches in length,\r\nbut when rung February 22, 1843, it was increased so much that it\r\nhenceforth became a silent memento of the historic past.\r\n\r\nThe Liberty Bell has made several trips to great national expositions,\r\nnotably the World’s Fair at Chicago, and the great San Francisco\r\nexposition, where it always was the most popular historic relic and\r\nviewed by millions of our citizens, but the danger incident to such\r\nexposure caused public disapproval of the bell again leaving the State\r\nHouse, and it will rest in this historic spot and continue to be the\r\nmost popular relic in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Transit of Venus Observed in Yard of\r\n                        State House June 3, 1769\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 1769 was memorable in the annals of astronomy, owing to the\r\ntransit of Venus over the sun’s disc, which occurred June 3. Astronomers\r\nthroughout the entire world were anxious to make an observation of this\r\ncelestial phenomenon, which would not occur again until 1874.\r\n\r\nThe great interest centered in this observation arose from the fact that\r\nby means of it the distance between the heavenly bodies could be more\r\naccurately calculated. It was the belief that the transits of Venus\r\nafforded the best method of measuring the distance of the sun from the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThis was a period of intense interest, and many expeditions were fitted\r\nout to observe the transit at different places in both the northern and\r\nsouthern hemispheres.\r\n\r\nMason and Dixon, the English astronomers, who gained undying fame as the\r\nsurveyors of the boundary line between Pennsylvania and Maryland,\r\nstarted on a ship of war for their station on the southern hemisphere,\r\nbut they were attacked by a French frigate and were compelled to return\r\nto port after a severe battle. Other expeditions became celebrated\r\nthrough the adventures to which they gave rise.\r\n\r\nThe transit of 1769 was visible in the Atlantic States and observations\r\nupon it were made under the auspices of the American Philosophical\r\nSociety at Philadelphia. The most celebrated of all these observers was\r\nDavid Rittenhouse.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Franklin had organized the society and in 1769 became the\r\nsociety’s first president. He was annually elected to that position for\r\ntwenty-two years, being succeeded in 1791 by another Pennsylvanian,\r\nDavid Rittenhouse.\r\n\r\nIn 1768 the American Philosophical Society petitioned the Assembly of\r\nPennsylvania for assistance to observe the transit of Venus, and the\r\nproposition was treated with liberality.\r\n\r\nOne hundred pounds was granted to enable the society to procure a\r\nreflecting telescope of two and a half or three feet focus and a\r\nmicrometer of Dolland’s make, which had to be procured from England.\r\nThey were purchased there by Dr. Franklin.\r\n\r\nThe society erected a wooden building as an observatory in the State\r\nHouse yard. This was of circular shape, and about twenty feet high,\r\ntwelve to fifteen feet square and placed about sixty feet south of the\r\nState House.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of June 3 the sky was cloudless. The transit was observed\r\nfrom this building in the State House yard by Dr. John Ewing, Joseph\r\nShippen, Dr. Hugh Williamson, Thomas Prior, Charles Thomson and James\r\nPearson.\r\n\r\nWhile they were thus engaged, David Rittenhouse, Dr. William Smith, John\r\nSellers and John Lukens noticed the phenomena at Norriton, the home of\r\nthe celebrated astronomer. Owen Biddle made an observation at Henlopen\r\nlighthouse.\r\n\r\nRittenhouse was already a member of the American Philosophical Society\r\nand made his observations for that society. He used a telescope and\r\nother instruments made by his own hands.\r\n\r\nWhen he observed the contact, and the planet had fairly entered the\r\nsun’s disk, his emotions so overpowered him that he sank fainting to the\r\nground, unable to bear the intense feelings of delight which attended\r\nthe consummation of the long hoped for event. Rising from his\r\nexhaustion, he proceeded to measure the distance between the centers of\r\nthe two bodies at stated intervals during the transit.\r\n\r\nThe observations of Rittenhouse were received with interest by\r\nscientific men everywhere. Subsequently they were found to be nearly\r\naccurate and his computations placed him among the greatest of\r\nastronomers. The royal astronomer of England bore testimony to their\r\nvalue and another high authority said:\r\n\r\n“The first approximately accurate results in the measurements of the\r\nspheres were given to the world, not by schooled and salaried\r\nastronomers who watched from the magnificent royal observatories of\r\nEurope, but by unpaid amateurs and devotees to science in the youthful\r\nprovince of Pennsylvania.”\r\n\r\nOn November 9 of the same year David Rittenhouse made an observation of\r\nthe transit of Mercury, which was the fourth ever witnessed. About this\r\ntime he also determined the difference of the meridians of Norriton and\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\nDavid Rittenhouse was without doubt the first inventor of a practical\r\nplanetarium, erroneously called the “orrery,” an instrument so\r\nconstructed as to exhibit the movements of the planets around the sun.\r\nIn theory the idea was not new. Such an instrument had been made for the\r\nEarl of Orrery in 1715, but this was a mere toy and gave the movements\r\nof only two heavenly bodies.\r\n\r\nRittenhouse determined that he would make an elaborate instrument, based\r\non scientific principles and on the astronomical calculations which he\r\nhad prepared. After three years of labor, in 1779, the “Rittenhouse\r\norrery” was completed.\r\n\r\nThis orrery was purchased by Princeton University for £300. The trustees\r\nof the College of Philadelphia were offended, but Rittenhouse\r\nimmediately set to work and constructed a duplicate, which was purchased\r\nfor the college by the proceeds of a series of lectures on astronomy by\r\nDr. William Smith, provost of the college.\r\n\r\nThe second orrery was much larger than the original, but was constructed\r\non the same model. This was sold for £400.\r\n\r\nDavid Rittenhouse was elected one of the secretaries of the American\r\nPhilosophical Society in 1771. He delivered a most elaborate address\r\nbefore the society February 23, 1775, entitled “An Oration on\r\nAstronomy.” This address was inscribed and dedicated to the delegates\r\nassembled in the Continental Congress. In 1790 he became one of its vice\r\npresidents.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Dr. Franklin he succeeded to the office of president,\r\nJanuary, 1791, which office he held until his death, when he was\r\nsucceeded by Thomas Jefferson.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Indians Succeed in Destroying Presqu' Isle,\r\n                              June 4, 1763\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1763 Pontiac’s grand scheme of destroying all the English forts was\r\ncompleted, and it was determined the attack should be made\r\nsimultaneously on June 4. Henry L. Harvey, in the Erie Observer, gives\r\nthe following account of the attack on Fort Presqu' Isle.\r\n\r\n“The troops had retired to their quarters to procure their morning\r\nrepast; some had already finished, and were sauntering about the\r\nfortress or the shores of the lake. All were joyous, in holiday attire\r\nand dreaming of nought but the pleasures of the occasion. A knocking was\r\nheard at the gate, and three Indians were announced, in hunting garb,\r\ndesiring an interview with the commander. Their tale was soon told; they\r\nsaid they belonged to a hunting party which had started to Niagara with\r\na lot of furs; that their canoes were bad, and they would prefer\r\ndisposing of them here, if they could do so to advantage, and return\r\nrather than go farther; that their party was encamped by a small stream\r\nwest of the fort, about a mile, where they had landed the previous\r\nnight, and where they wished the commander to go and examine their\r\npeltries, as it was difficult to bring them as they wished to embark\r\nfrom where they were if they did not trade.\r\n\r\n“The commander, accompanied by a clerk, left the fort with the Indians,\r\ncharging his lieutenant that none should leave the fort, and none but\r\nits inmates be admitted until his return. Well would it probably have\r\nbeen had this order been obeyed. After the lapse of sufficient time for\r\nthe captain to have visited the encampment of the Indians and return, a\r\nparty of the latter—variously estimated, but probably about one hundred\r\nand fifty—advanced toward the fort, bearing upon their backs what\r\nappeared to be large packs of furs, which they informed the lieutenant\r\nthe captain had purchased and ordered deposited in the fort.\r\n\r\n“The stratagem succeeded, and when the party were all within the fort,\r\nthe work of an instant threw off the packs and the short cloaks which\r\ncovered their weapons—the whole being fastened by one loop and button at\r\nthe neck. Resistance at this time was useless or ineffectual, and the\r\nwork of death was as rapid as savage strength and weapons could make it.\r\nThe shortened rifles, which had been sawed off for the purpose of\r\nconcealing them under their cloaks and in the packs of furs, were once\r\ndischarged, and of what remained the tomahawk and knife were made to do\r\nthe execution.\r\n\r\n“The history of savage war presents not a scene of more heartless or\r\nblood-thirsty vengeance than was exhibited on this occasion, and few its\r\nequal in horror. The few who were taken prisoners in the fort were\r\ndoomed to the various tortures devised by savage ingenuity, until, save\r\ntwo individuals, all who awoke to celebrate that day at the fort had\r\npassed away to the eternal world.\r\n\r\n“Of these two, one was a soldier who had gone into the woods near the\r\nfort, and on his return, observing a body of Indians dragging away some\r\nprisoners, he escaped and immediately proceeded to Niagara. The other\r\nwas a female who had taken shelter in a small building below the hill,\r\nnear the mouth of the creek. Here she remained undiscovered until near\r\nnight of the fatal day, when she was drawn forth, but her life, for some\r\nreason, was spared, and she was made prisoner, and ultimately ransomed\r\nand restored to civilized life. She was subsequently married and settled\r\nin Canada. From her statement, and the information she obtained during\r\nher captivity, corroborated by other sources, this account of the\r\nmassacre is gathered.\r\n\r\n“Others have varied it so far as relates to the result, particularly\r\nThatcher, who, in his Life of Pontiac, says: ‘The officer who commanded\r\nat Presqu’ Isle defended himself two days during which time the savages\r\nare said to have fired his blockhouse about fifty times, but the\r\nsoldiers extinguished the flames as often. It was then undermined, and a\r\ntrain laid for an explosion, when a capitulation was proposed and agreed\r\nupon, under which a part of the garrison was carried captive to the\r\nNorthwest. The officer was afterward given up at Detroit.' He does not,\r\nhowever, give any authority for his statements, while most writers\r\nconcur that all were destroyed.\r\n\r\n“The number who escaped from Le Boeuf is variously estimated from three\r\nto seven. Their escape was effected through a secret or underground\r\npassage, having its outlet in the direction of the swamp adjoining Le\r\nBoeuf Lake. Tradition, however, says that of these only one survived to\r\nreach a civilized settlement.”\r\n\r\nSo adroitly was the whole campaign managed that nine of the garrisons\r\nreceived no notice of the design in time to guard against it, and fell\r\nan easy conquest to the assailants.\r\n\r\nNiagara, Pittsburgh, Ligonier and Bedford were strongly invested, but\r\nwithstood the attacks until relief arrived from the Eastern settlements.\r\nThe scattered settlers in their vicinity were generally murdered or\r\nforced to flee to the fort. Depredations were committed as far east as\r\nCarlisle and Reading, and the whole country was alarmed.\r\n\r\nColonel Bradstreet and Colonel Bouquet attacked the savages everywhere.\r\nGeneral Gage directed the movements against the Indians. Bradstreet\r\nfailed to comprehend the Indian character, but Bouquet conquered the\r\nsavages everywhere on his route, and so completely defeated them that he\r\nwas able to dictate terms of peace, and received a large number of\r\npersons who had been carried into captivity from Pennsylvania and\r\nVirginia. He was hailed as a deliverer by the people and received the\r\nthanks of the Governments of Pennsylvania and Virginia.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                James Pollock Nominated by Know Nothing\r\n                          Party, June 5, 1854\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernor William Bigler’s administration was universally acceptable to\r\nhis party, and even his most earnest political opponents found little\r\nground for criticism, but when he came up for re-election two entirely\r\nnew and unexpected factors confronted him and doomed him to defeat on\r\nissues which had no relation to the administration of State affairs.\r\nFirst of these was the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, and second,\r\nthe advent of the secret American, or Know Nothing Party.\r\n\r\nThe American, or Know Nothing, organization that became such an\r\nimportant political power in 1854, was the culmination of various\r\nspasmodic native American organizations beginning in New York, as early\r\nas 1835, and extending to Philadelphia and Boston. The original Native\r\nAmerican organization of New York was directed wholly against foreigners\r\nwho held positions on the police force and in other city departments. It\r\ncame into its greatest power in 1844, when it controlled the entire city\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe Native Americans carried the fall elections in Philadelphia, in\r\n1844, with material aid from the Whigs, and remained an important\r\nelement in both City and State politics in Pennsylvania for a number of\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe name Know Nothing was applied to this organization because the\r\nmembers were ordered to reply to any question in regard to the party or\r\nits purposes, “I don’t know.” In the same way “Sam” was nicknamed for\r\nthat party. This was applied frequently to persons suspected of being\r\nmembers of which it was said they had “seen Sam.”\r\n\r\nChief Justice Black said of the Know Nothings: “They’re like the bee,\r\nbiggest when it’s born; it will perish as quickly as it rose to power.”\r\nTruly a prophecy.\r\n\r\nIn 1854 the Whig candidate for the office of Mayor, Robert T. Conrad,\r\nwas supported by the Know Nothings and defeated Richard Vaux by more\r\nthan 8000 votes. After this the Know Nothing Party declined in strength,\r\nand finally what was left of it and the remnant of the Whig organization\r\nwere absorbed in the Republican Party. After 1856 the Know Nothing party\r\npractically disappeared as a general political factor.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs and Democrats held their regular State conventions early in\r\nthe year of 1854. Governor Bigler was renominated by the Democrats, and\r\nJames Pollock was nominated by the Whigs.\r\n\r\nPollock indicated Andrew G. Curtin as the man to take charge of his\r\ncampaign, and Curtin was made chairman of the Whig State Committee. He\r\nentered upon his new duties with the ardor that was always manifested in\r\nhis public efforts, and everything seemed to be going along smoothly,\r\nuntil he learned that there was a secret organization in the State that\r\nembraced a clear majority of the Whig voters and not a few of the\r\nDemocratic voters.\r\n\r\nThere were three men of low cunning who had managed to obtain possession\r\nof the machinery of the Know Nothing organization and they availed\r\nthemselves of the peculiar facilities offered by a secret organization\r\nto assume autocratic authority.\r\n\r\nThese three leaders sought out Curtin, and, proving to him that they had\r\nit in their power to compute the returns of the Know Nothing lodges and\r\ndeclare for or against any candidate for office, declared their purpose\r\nto defeat the Whig candidate for Governor if their wishes were not\r\nacceded to. Each of the three men required of Curtin a pledge that three\r\nof the most lucrative offices in the gift of the Governor, the\r\ninspectorships of Philadelphia, should be given them.\r\n\r\nThey did not conceal the fact that it made no difference how the Know\r\nNothing lodges voted, they would declare the nomination in favor of or\r\nagainst Pollock, depending upon Curtin’s agreement to their proposition.\r\nCurtin deliberated long and had several conferences before he finally\r\nacceded to their demands to the extent that he would recommend the\r\nappointments they demanded, but that he would not give an unqualified\r\npledge as to the action of the Governor, and that Pollock was to have no\r\nknowledge nor was he to be advised of it during the contest.\r\n\r\nThe entire program was then arranged that the State Council on June 5\r\nshould announce as the nominees of the Know Nothing Party James Pollock,\r\nWhig, for Governor; Henry S. Mott, Democrat, for Canal Commissioner, and\r\nThomas Bair, Know Nothing Party, for Supreme Judge.\r\n\r\nNeither Pollock nor Mott were members of the Know Nothing Party, and\r\nboth were placed in nomination without their personal knowledge of being\r\ncandidates of that organization.\r\n\r\nPollock was elected by 37,007 over Bigler; Mott was elected over Darsie\r\nby 190,743; and Jeremiah S. Black was elected by 45,535 over Bair, Know\r\nNothing, and Smyser, Whig.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the election was over and Mott realized that he had been\r\ngiven this large majority by the Know Nothing vote, he openly denounced\r\nthe organization as deliberately guilty of a fraud in making him its\r\ncandidate, and from that day was the most vindictive opponent of Know\r\nNothingism the State could furnish.\r\n\r\nThe alleged nomination of Pollock and Mott by the Know Nothing\r\norganization was a deliberate fraud upon the Know Nothing people, as was\r\nevidenced by the fact that their names were submitted to the various\r\nlodges by the State Council as candidates and as members of the order,\r\nwhen, in fact, neither of them was a member, but it mattered little\r\nwhether the lodges voted for or against Pollock and Mott, there was no\r\npower to revise the returns, and they were accepted as candidates\r\nwithout a question and their election assured.\r\n\r\nFew knew of the Know Nothing organization. Even Curtin had no conception\r\nof its strength and never dreamed of the political revolution that it\r\nwas about to work out.\r\n\r\nThe three Know Nothing traders decided that they would accept the\r\nposition of flour inspector, leather inspector and bark inspector.\r\nCurtin literally fulfilled his pledge, stating to the Governor all that\r\nhad transpired and left the Governor to solve the problem.\r\n\r\nThe Governor was first determined to appoint none of them, but\r\nreconsidered and gave one of them a minor inspectorship of the city. The\r\ndisappointed Know Nothing leaders had to accept defeat as they had no\r\nother way of visiting vengeance upon any one, and their party went to\r\npieces within a year.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 John Penn Found First Wife Dying After\r\n                     Second Marriage, June 6, 1766\r\n\r\n\r\nA sad incident in the life of John Penn has been told in the story of\r\nTulliallan.[2] While Richard and Thomas Penn, sons of the founder, were\r\nselecting plate they intended to present to the English battleship\r\nAdmiral Penn, John, the seventeen-year-old son of Richard, accompanied\r\nthem to the establishment of James Cox, the silversmith.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  The first of a delightful collection of folk lore and legends\r\n  collected and published as “Allegheny Episodes,” by Colonel Henry W.\r\n  Shoemaker, 1922.\r\n\r\nDuring this errand John Penn met for the first time Marie Cox, the\r\nsilversmith’s only daughter, and they fell desperately in love with each\r\nother. Many visits were made to the fine Quaker home of James Cox, which\r\nannoyed the elder Penn, and remonstrate as he did it proved of no avail.\r\nA trip to Gretna Green was made, and John Penn, aged nineteen, and Marie\r\nCox, aged seventeen, were duly made husband and wife.\r\n\r\nWhen Richard Penn, the father, and his brother Thomas were apprised by\r\nyoung John of what he had done, he was locked in his room, and after\r\ndark he was taken to the waterfront and placed aboard a ship sailing for\r\nthe coast of France. He was carried to Paris, and there carefully\r\nwatched, but supplied with all the money he required.\r\n\r\nTemporarily John Penn forgot about his wife, Marie, as he plunged into\r\nthe gayeties of the French capital. The pace was rapid and he soon\r\nbecame seriously ill, but he grew better and was taken to Geneva to\r\nconvalesce. There he was followed by agents of his creditors, who\r\nthreatened him with imprisonment for debt. John wrote his father in\r\nLondon, who turned a deaf ear to the prodigal; not so Uncle Thomas.\r\n\r\nThomas Penn wrote to his nephew that he would save him from a debtor’s\r\ncell provided he would divorce his wife and go to Pennsylvania for an\r\nindefinite period. John was in an attitude to promise anything, and soon\r\nhis bills were settled. While awaiting his ship to take him to\r\nPhiladelphia, the young man went to London for a day to say good-by to\r\nhis relations.\r\n\r\nThe ship was delayed several days by a severe storm and as John was\r\nstrolling up the streets in Cheapside, to his surprise he met his bride,\r\nthe deserted Marie Cox Penn. He was much in love with her and she was\r\nready to forgive. They spent the balance of that day together and during\r\ndinner in a restaurant it was arranged that Marie should follow her\r\nhusband to America; meanwhile he would provide a home for her under an\r\nassumed name, until he became of age, when he would defy his family to\r\nagain tear them apart.\r\n\r\nJohn Penn arrived in Philadelphia in November, 1752. He evinced but\r\nlittle interest in provincial affairs, except to make a trip into the\r\ninterior. He was accompanied by a bodyguard, among whom was Peter Allen.\r\nPenn took a fancy to the sturdy frontiersman, “a poor relation” of Chief\r\nJustice William Allen.\r\n\r\nAllen had built a stone house twelve miles west of Harris’ Ferry, which\r\nhe called “Tulliallan.” This was the outpost of civilization. John Penn\r\nselected this place for his bride, and as Peter Allen had three young\r\ndaughters, Penn soon arranged that Marie should be their teacher.\r\n\r\nJohn Penn dispatched his valet to London to escort Marie to America. She\r\narrived and her husband took her to Peter Allen’s, where she became a\r\ngreat favorite and found the new life agreeable. She assumed the name\r\nMaria Warren. That was in 1754.\r\n\r\nAll went well until the Penns in London learned that Marie Cox Penn had\r\ngone to America, and they traced her to “Tulliallan.”\r\n\r\nMaria Warren mysteriously disappeared. At the same time went two\r\nfriendly Indians from that neighborhood.\r\n\r\nEarly the following summer, John Penn set out for Peter Allen’s, and\r\nwhen he arrived he learned that his wife was gone a fortnight, they knew\r\nnot how or where.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by servants and settlers, Penn hunted the mountains, far and\r\nwide, and inquired of all with whom he came in contact, red or white,\r\nbut no trace of his wife could be found. He never gave up the search\r\nuntil he suffered a nervous collapse, and was sent to his home in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nIn 1763, he returned as Lieutenant Governor, and arrived in Philadelphia\r\nOctober 30. On June 6, 1766, he married Anne, daughter of William Allen,\r\nChief Justice of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nA few years later he took a trip through the interior. He stopped at\r\nPeter Allen’s and there learned that the Indians had carried his beloved\r\nMarie a captive to Canada. It was not long after returning that he again\r\nstarted on another expedition up the Susquehanna River.\r\n\r\nA stop was made at Fisher’s Stone House, at what is now known as\r\nFisher’s Ferry, below Sunbury. He was given a noisy welcome and he\r\nenjoyed these plain frontier people. While seated by the fireplace he\r\nheard coughing in an inner room, and inquired of Peter Fisher who it was\r\nwho was ill.\r\n\r\n“It’s an English woman, your Honor,” replied Fisher. “Tell me about\r\nher,” said the Governor. Then Fisher related the strange story, telling\r\nPenn that it is said he once loved this woman, that she was kidnapped\r\nand carried to Canada, that the Indians were paid for keeping her, that\r\nshe made her escape and walked all the way back, but became ill and\r\ncould not reach Peter Allen’s, and was now on her deathbed.\r\n\r\nPenn insisted on seeing her, and he went into the room. There lay his\r\nwife. They were soon in fond embrace and others left them alone in the\r\nroom. Ten minutes later Penn ran to the door and called, “Come quick, I\r\nfear she is going.” The household assembled but in a few minutes Marie\r\nCox Penn was dead. It is said she lies buried there on a hill which\r\noverlooks the Susquehanna.\r\n\r\nJohn Penn returned to Philadelphia and took no more trips through the\r\ninterior of Pennsylvania. He died childless, February 9, 1795. His wife,\r\nnee Allen, survived him until 1813.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Colonel William Clapham Began Erection\r\n                     of Fort Halifax, June 7, 1756\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in the year of 1756 Governor Morris commissioned Lieutenant\r\nColonel William Clapham to recruit the “Augusta Regiment” and build Fort\r\nAugusta, at Shamokin, now Sunbury. Clapham rendezvoused his troops at\r\nHunter’s Mills, also known as Fort Hunter and then started his march up\r\nthe river toward Shamokin.\r\n\r\nThe first camp was established at Armstrong’s, where on June 7 the\r\ncommander wrote to Governor Morris saying this was the “most convenient\r\nplace on the river between Harris’ and Shamokin for a magazine on\r\naccount of its good natural situation above the Juniata Falls, the vast\r\nplenty of pine timber at hand, its nearness to Shamokin and a saw within\r\na quarter of a mile.”\r\n\r\nThe saw was at Armstrong’s place, at the mouth of Armstrong’s Creek. The\r\nsoldiers cut and squared two hundred logs, each thirty feet in length,\r\nand erected the fortification.\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of this work an important Indian conference between\r\nColonel Clapham and the Iroquois was held. The speaker for the Indians\r\nwas Oghaghradisha, the noted chieftain of that nation. At this\r\nconference, held June 10, 1756, the Indians agreed to the building of a\r\nfort at Shamokin, but also wanted another fort built three days’ journey\r\nin a canoe farther up the North Branch in their branch, called\r\nAdjouquay, the mouth of present Lackawanna Creek. The Indians agreed to\r\nhelp build this fort.\r\n\r\nColonel Clapham wrote to Governor Morris from the “Camp at Armstrong’s”\r\non June 20, 1756:\r\n\r\n“The progress already made in this fort renders it impracticable for me\r\nto comply with the commissioner’s desire to contract it, at which I am\r\nmore surprised, as I expected every day orders to enlarge it, it being\r\nas yet, in my opinion, too small. I shall leave an officer and thirty\r\nmen, with orders to finish it, when I march from hence, which will be\r\nwith all possible expedition after the arrival of the blankets, the rum\r\nand the money for the payment of the battoe-men, for want of which I am\r\nobliged to detain them here in idleness, not thinking it prudent to\r\ntrust them on another trip for fear of their desertion, which may\r\ntotally impede the service. I could wish the commissioners would invent\r\nsome expedient to pay these men without money, or at least without the\r\ndanger of trusting me with their money, the charge of which I am not\r\nambitious of, or the much envied honor and trouble of expending it. This\r\nfar is certain, that without such expedient or money we cannot stir.\r\n\r\n“I have pursuant to your Honor’s command sent down two Indian Sachems,\r\nproperly escorted and committed particularly in the care of Mr. Shippen\r\n(Edward, of Lancaster), and hope their coming will fully answer the ends\r\nproposed by your Honor and your Council. I have found Captain McKee\r\nextremely useful, and have sent him also at the Sachem’s particular\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\n“The carpenters are still employed in building Battoes and carriages for\r\nthe canoes, and everybody seems disposed cheerfully to contribute their\r\nservices toward the public good; if there ever was any prospect or\r\nassurance of being paid for it.\r\n\r\n“I assure myself, your Honor, will omit no opportunity of extricating me\r\nfrom embarrassments arising from the want of money, both for the\r\nBattoe-men and the soldiers; twenty-six of whom being Dutch (German) are\r\nnow in confinement for mutiny on that very account. I am with all\r\nrespect your Honor’s obedient servant.\r\n\r\n                                                   ”WILLIAM CLAPHAM.\r\n\r\n“P. S.—The Fort at this place is without a name till your Honor is\r\npleased to confer one.”\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of the month the Governor wrote from Philadelphia to Colonel\r\nClapham. “The Fort at Armstrong’s I would have it called Fort Halifax.”\r\nThis was in honor of the Earl of Halifax.\r\n\r\nThe exact location of this fort is discernible today, if one will drive\r\nalong the concrete highway above the present borough of Halifax and turn\r\noff toward the river, after crossing the bridge which spans Armstrong’s\r\nRun. The covered bridge, near the mouth of the creek is the site of the\r\nold Armstrong sawmill to which Colonel Clapham referred. A short\r\ndistance below are the remains of the foundation of the Armstrong home\r\nwhich was built prior to 1755, and a few hundreds yards below will be\r\nseen a small rise in the ground which is also marked with a small square\r\nmonument. It was on this slight eminence that Fort Halifax was built.\r\n\r\nColonel Clapham, July 1, thanked the Governor for £100, which he\r\ndistributed to the bateau men, but complained that the sum sent was\r\ninsufficient. He commented upon the difficulties of conducting so\r\n“amphibious” an expedition.\r\n\r\nWhen Colonel Clapham departed from Fort Halifax he left a detail of\r\nthirty men, under command of Captain Nathaniel Miles, to whom he gave\r\nmost explicit instructions, even down to the detail of mounting guard\r\nand where the sentries should be stationed about the post, and in event\r\nof a surprise attack, just how each one should demean himself.\r\n\r\nDuring the long period in which the provincial soldiers were building\r\nthe most important Fort Augusta at Shamokin, there was much activity at\r\nFort Halifax.\r\n\r\nAmmunition, clothing, food and supplies were all stored there and\r\ncarried farther up stream in bateaux when conditions permitted such\r\ntransportation. The garrison usually consisted of thirty to fifty\r\nsoldiers, under command of a captain. Escorts were furnished from this\r\npost in either direction as the urgency of the mission required.\r\n\r\nColonel Clapham was convinced that the garrison at Fort Halifax should\r\nnever be less than 100 men, so that proper communication between the\r\ninhabitants and Fort Augusta could be maintained.\r\n\r\nThere are no positive records of an attack upon Fort Halifax. U. J.\r\nJones, in his “Story of Simon Girty, the Outlaw,” writes of an Indian\r\nattack, led by this notorious Tory, which was successfully repulsed,\r\nwith heavy loss among the besiegers. However, this is more a story of\r\nfiction than history.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1757, after the completion of Fort Augusta, a petition was\r\npresented to the Governor, praying the removal of the garrison from Fort\r\nHalifax to Hunter’s, the defense of the former being considered of\r\nlittle importance to the inhabitants south of the mountains. This\r\nremoval was soon thereafter effected, and Fort Halifax passed into\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Earliest Court Removed from Upland to\r\n                         Kingsesse June 8, 1680\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a court held at Upland, now Chester, “on ye 2d Tuesday, being ye 8th\r\nday of ye month of June in ye 32 yeare of his Majesty’s Raigne Anno Dom.\r\n1680,” with Otto Ernest Cock, Israel Helm, Henry Jones and Laurens Cock,\r\nas justices, there was a busy session and much business of importance\r\ntransacted.\r\n\r\nJames Sandelands sued Hanna Salter for the account due him of two\r\nhundred and seven gilders, and the Court ordered judgment to be entered\r\nwith costs, with stay of execution until the defendant could get in her\r\nwheat.\r\n\r\nGunla Andries brought suit against Jonas Nielsen for unlawful possession\r\nof some land at Kingsesse. “The debates of both parties being heard, &\r\nye Pattent & former orders of Court examined: The Court Doe confirme the\r\nformer orders of this Court in that Case made and doe order the Sheriffe\r\nto Put the Plt. in Possession of ye Land according to Pattent & ye sd\r\nformer orders of this Court.”\r\n\r\nThe Court granted William Clark liberty to take up two hundred acres in\r\nNieshambenies Creek; Peter Cock, Neeles Jonassen, Thomas Fairman, and\r\nHenry Jacobs, were granted each a like amount of land.\r\n\r\nMoens Staecket, who had been in trouble, was bound over so that in\r\nfuture he would behave himself.\r\n\r\nThe Court took into consideration the raising of their own salaries,\r\nwhen they ordered each person should “pay yearly one Scipple of wheat or\r\n5 gilders.” According to a former order, they also decreed that those in\r\narrears should be brought before Justice Otto Ernest at Tinicum Island,\r\nand those who failed to report there should “be fetched by ye Constable\r\nby way of restraynt.”\r\n\r\nRichard Noble, the surveyor for Upland County, made a return of surveys\r\nhaving been made for Andrew Boen, William Clayton, Christian Claess,\r\nAndrew Homman, William Woodmancy, Peter Nealson and William Orian. Which\r\nsurveys were approved by the Court and returned to the office in New\r\nYork, for confirmation by the Governor.\r\n\r\nThen came the most important event of the day’s business. It seems that\r\nthere was complaint about the location of Upland, as it was “att ye\r\nLower End of ye County. The Court therefore for ye most ease of ye\r\npeople have thought fitt for ye future to sit & meet att ye Town of\r\nKingsesse in ye Schuylkills.”\r\n\r\nThe site of Kingsesse was probably in the immediate vicinity of the\r\nSwedish mill erected by Governor Printz, near the Blue Bell tavern on\r\nthe Darby road.\r\n\r\nThen followed the last action brought before the Court at Upland, it was\r\nthe case of Gunla Andries and her husband, in a land dispute with the\r\nheirs of Peter Andries and Jonas Neelson.\r\n\r\nThe Court then moved to Kingsesse and its next session was held October\r\n13. The same justices with the addition of George Browne, who qualified\r\nat the opening of the court.\r\n\r\nSlander suits were the order of the day. That between Claes Cram and\r\nHans Peters is interesting. Cram claimed Peters called him a thief, and\r\ntwo witnesses swore that they heard Peters say that Cram had stolen\r\naboard a ship and in the same manner stole all his riches. The verdict\r\nwas that since the defendant was not able to prove “what he hath said or\r\nany part thereof the Court ordered that ye defendant openly shall\r\ndeclare himself a liar and that he shall further declare ye plaintiff to\r\nbe an honest man and pay twenty gilders to ye plaintiff for his loss of\r\ntime, together with the cost of ye suite.”\r\n\r\nHans Jurian declared that Moens Staecket, during September, assaulted\r\nand beat him at his own door, followed him into his house, calling him a\r\nrogue and a dog and a thousand more names, and moreover threatened to\r\nkill Jurian whenever he met him.\r\n\r\nOne witness swore that he saw the defendant all bloody and he told him\r\nJurian did it, that Staecket later appeared “on horseback and called for\r\nhis sword, his gun, powder and shot and then rode before Hans Jurian’s\r\ndoor and, calling him, saying you dog, you rogue, come out, I will shoot\r\nyou a bullet through your head.”\r\n\r\nThe Court bound both over to keep the peace for one year and six weeks,\r\nunder penalty of £40 of lawful money of England, to be paid by him that\r\nshall first break ye peace. Staecket was also fined 200 gilders; the\r\ncosts of the case were divided between the litigants.\r\n\r\nLater in the same day the same Staecket was defendant in another action\r\nbrought by the presiding justice, Otto Ernest Cock, complaining that\r\nStaecket maliciously defamed and slandered him by calling him a hog\r\nthief. The defendant protested that he never knew, heard or saw the\r\nplaintiff steal a hog, and that he to his knowledge never said any such\r\nthing but that he hath said it, as the witness doth affirm, that it must\r\nhave been, when he was in his drink, and he humbly desired forgiveness,\r\nsince he finds himself in a great fault. Staecket was ordered to openly\r\ndeclare that Justice Cock was not a hog thief, and he was fined 1000\r\ngilders.\r\n\r\nThere were eleven cases tried this day, one, at least, before a jury.\r\nNine petitions were disposed of and the Court issued a written direction\r\nfor the overseers of the highways. Certainly a busy day in court.\r\n\r\nThe Court adjourned until second Tuesday of ye month of March next\r\nensuing.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Last Purchase from Indians Caused by\r\n                     Boundary Dispute, June 9, 1769\r\n\r\n\r\nOne important feature of the last treaty made with the Indians at Fort\r\nStanwix, October, 1784, was the settlement of the difficulties which had\r\nexisted for sixteen years among the white settlers over the disputed\r\nboundary line embraced by Tiadaghton.\r\n\r\nIt was contended by some that Lycoming Creek was this line, and by\r\nothers that it was Pine Creek. The territory between these streams is\r\nthat which lies between the present City of Williamsport and Jersey\r\nShore, and includes nearly half of the present Lycoming County and all\r\nof Tioga.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the purchase of November 5, 1768, this part of the West\r\nBranch Valley was occupied by tribes of Shawnee and Munsee, and the way\r\nfor its settlement by whites was not opened until the “New Purchase” was\r\nmade at Fort Stanwix.\r\n\r\nOn June 9, 1769, a serious difference arose between the Provincial\r\nGovernment and the settlers whether the stream called Tiadaghton,\r\nmentioned in the treaty was Lycoming or Pine Creek when translated into\r\nEnglish. This question remained in dispute until the last treaty,\r\nOctober, 1784.\r\n\r\nThis early settlement is made clear by the reference to Smith’s Laws,\r\nwhere is the following:\r\n\r\n“There existed a great number of locations on the 3d of April, 1769, for\r\nthe choicest lands on the West Branch of Susquehanna, between the mouths\r\nof Lycoming and Pine Creeks; but the Proprietaries from extreme caution,\r\nthe result of that experience which had also produced the very penal\r\nlaws of 1768 and 1769, and the proclamation already stated, had\r\nprohibited any surveys being made beyond the Lycoming. In the meantime,\r\nin violation of all laws, a set of hardy adventurers had from time to\r\ntime seated themselves on this doubtful territory. They made\r\nimprovements, and formed a very considerable population.\r\n\r\n“It is true, so far as regarded the rights to real property, they were\r\nnot under the protection of the laws of the country, and were we to\r\nadopt the visionary theories of some philosophers, who have drawn their\r\narguments from a supposed state of nature, we might be led to believe\r\nthat the state of these people would have been a state of continual\r\nwarfare; and that in contests for property the weakest must give way to\r\nthe strongest.\r\n\r\n“To prevent the consequences, real or supposed, of this state of things,\r\nthey formed a mutual compact among themselves. They annually elected a\r\ntribunal, in rotation, of three of their settlers, whom they called\r\n_fair-play men_, who were to decide all controversies, and settle\r\ndisputed boundaries. From their decision there was no appeal. There\r\ncould be no resistance. The decree was enforced by the whole body, who\r\nstarted up in mass, at the mandate of the court, and execution and\r\neviction were as sudden and irresistible as the judgment. Every new\r\ncomer was obliged to apply to this powerful tribunal, and upon his\r\nsolemn engagement to submit in all respects to the law of the land he\r\nwas permitted to take possession of some vacant spot. Their decrees\r\nwere, however, just; and when their settlements were recognized by law,\r\nand fair play had ceased, their decisions were received in evidence, and\r\nconfirmed by judgment of courts.”\r\n\r\nIn those early days, as later, the white man was pushing the Indian\r\nback, in spite of the proclamation of Governor Penn, which warned all\r\npersons not to settle on lands not purchased of the Indians and\r\nunsurveyed, and advised those that had settled to make haste and leave.\r\nBut they did not vacate, and in the enforcement of their “fair-play”\r\ncode, it became necessary to adopt rigid measures. Any person resisting\r\nthe decrees was placed in a canoe, rowed to the mouth of Lycoming Creek,\r\nand there sent adrift. Subsequently a law was passed, allowing the\r\nsettlers from Lycoming and Pine Creeks a preemption right to not over\r\nthree hundred acres of land each, upon satisfactory proof being\r\npresented that they were actual settlers previous to 1780.\r\n\r\nFor seven years after the purchase of 1768, the pioneers swung the axe,\r\nfelled the giant trees, builded their cabins, and tilled their fields\r\nunmolested; but just when they began to enjoy the comforts of their\r\ncabin homes, and reap the rewards of their industry, the cry of the\r\nRevolution was heard, and the hardy backwoodsmen trained to the\r\nvicissitudes of war during the frontier campaigns of 1755 to 1763, with\r\ntrue patriotism, seized their rifles and went forth to battle for\r\nliberty, leaving their families scantily provided for and exposed to the\r\nraids of the Indians.\r\n\r\nAll along the West Branch, wherever there was a white settlement,\r\nstockade forts were built, garrisoned by settlers or Provincial troops.\r\n\r\nAt the treaty of October 23, 1784, the Pennsylvania Commissioners were\r\nspecially instructed to inquire of the Indians which stream was really\r\nTiadaghton, and, also the Indian name of Burnetts’ Hills, left blank in\r\ndeed of 1768. The Indians informed them Tiadaghton was what the whites\r\ncall Pine Creek, being the largest stream flowing into the Otzinachson,\r\nor West Branch. They did not know the name of the hills. The authorities\r\napprehended difficulty in settling disputes among the actual settlers.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners at this treaty secured title from the Indians for the\r\nresidue of the lands within the limits of Pennsylvania. This purchase\r\nwas confirmed by the Wyandotte and Delaware nations at Fort McIntosh,\r\nJanuary 21, 1785.\r\n\r\nThus in a period of 102 years was the whole right of the Indians to the\r\nsoil of Pennsylvania extinguished.\r\n\r\nThe land office was opened for the new purchase in 1785 and settlers\r\nrapidly flocked to the West Branch Valley.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Massacre at Lycoming Creek, Present\r\n                      Williamsport, June 10, 1778\r\n\r\n\r\nAs early as 1773 settlers had made improvements at the mouth of Lycoming\r\nCreek, where the city of Williamsport now stands. For the next three or\r\nfour years there was no protection for settlers between there and Antes\r\nFort, about thirteen miles west.\r\n\r\nSome brave spirits, among whom were William King, Robert Covenhoven, and\r\nJames Armstrong, built a stockade inclosure at the mouth of the\r\nLycoming. This was located near what is now Fourth and Cemetery Streets,\r\nWilliamsport.\r\n\r\nThe rumors of a descent by the Tories and Indians on the North Branch\r\nhad reached the settlement at Northumberland, where William King, wife\r\nand two daughters lived. They thought the new stockade on the Lycoming\r\nwould be safe and a hurried trip was made up the West Branch.\r\n\r\nThe driver of the team remarked, as they approached Loyalsock Creek:\r\n“Here is the last stream we will cross before reaching the fort, and we\r\nwill stop for water.” The horses had no sooner halted than rifles\r\ncracked and the utmost confusion at once ensued.\r\n\r\nA description of the terrible massacre that followed is given in a long\r\nletter by Colonel Hosterman to Colonel Winter from Fort Muncy, under\r\ndate June 10, 1778.\r\n\r\nColonel Hosterman began his letter with the statement that nothing\r\nmaterial had happened since he was stationed at Fort Muncy until that\r\nday. He was in command of a party, consisting of Captain Reynolds and\r\nthirteen men which set out for Antes Fort, carrying a supply of\r\nammunition for the garrisons stationed there and at the Big Island.\r\n\r\nThe same day, remarks the Colonel, Peter Smith and his wife and six\r\nchildren; William King’s wife and two daughters, Ruth and Sarah; Michael\r\nSmith, Michael Campbell and David Chambers, the latter a member of\r\nCaptain Reynolds’ company, and two men named Snodgrass and Hammond, a\r\ntotal of six men, two women and eight children, were going in wagons to\r\nLycoming. When they arrived at Loyalsock Creek, John Harris (son of\r\nSamuel Harris) met them and told them that he had heard firing up the\r\ncreek and advised that they return to Fort Muncy, that to advance\r\nfarther was dangerous.\r\n\r\nPeter Smith said that firing would not stop him. Harris proceeded to\r\nFort Muncy, and the other party continued up the river. Soon as Harris\r\nreached the fort and told his story, a detail of fifteen soldiers\r\nstarted from the fort in the direction of where the firing had been\r\nheard.\r\n\r\nWhen Smith and his party arrived within a half mile of Lycoming Creek,\r\nthe Indians, lying in ambush, fired upon them, and at the first fire\r\nSnodgrass fell dead with a bullet through his forehead. The Indians gave\r\na halloo and rushed toward the wagon. The men hurried toward trees and\r\nwith these as a shelter returned the fire. A small lad and a girl\r\nescaped into the woods.\r\n\r\nThe Indians closed in on the party in an endeavor to surround them. This\r\nmovement was discovered by the men, who fled as rapidly as possible,\r\nleaving only Campbell, who was fighting at too close quarters to join\r\nhis companions in their flight. He was killed and scalped on the spot.\r\n\r\nBefore the men were out of sight of the wagon they saw the Indians\r\nattacking the women and children with their tomahawks. Chambers stated\r\nthat he believed there were about twenty Indians in the party.\r\n\r\nThis bloody affair occurred just before sundown. The lad who escaped\r\npushed on to the stockade on Lycoming Creek and informed the men there\r\nwhat had happened. They started immediately, but mistaking the\r\nintelligence the boy gave, hastened to the river to the place where they\r\nlived, thinking it was the canoe that was attacked instead of a wagon.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Captain William Hepburn, with the detail which started\r\nfrom Fort Muncy, arrived at the scene of the massacre, and found the\r\nbodies of Snodgrass and Campbell. It was too dark to pursue the savages,\r\nbut they pressed on toward Lycoming and met the party going out from\r\nthere. They waited until the next day.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of June 11 they returned to the scene and found the\r\nbodies of Peter Smith’s wife shot through, stabbed, scalped and a knife\r\nby her side.\r\n\r\nA little girl and a boy were killed and scalped. Snodgrass was found\r\nshot through the head and scalped, and a knife left sticking in his\r\nbody. The rifles had been taken by the Indians, but nothing of value was\r\nremoved from the wagon.\r\n\r\nThe lad who made his escape insisted that Mrs. King must be somewhere in\r\nthe thicket, as he heard her scream and say she would not go along with\r\nthe Indians when they were dragging her away. They made another search\r\nand found her near the stream where she had dragged herself and rested\r\nwith her hand under her bleeding head. She had been tomahawked and\r\nscalped, but not dead. She was sitting up and greeted her husband when\r\nhe approached her, but she expired almost instantly. She did not live\r\nlong enough to speak of the affair.\r\n\r\nWilliam King was the picture of despair. He soon returned to\r\nNorthumberland, and later moved up to Vincents Island. Many years later\r\nhe learned that his daughter was still alive, and he started on foot\r\nwith knapsack on his back, accompanied by an old Indian, for Niagara. He\r\nsoon found Sarah, but had to travel far and suffered severe hardships\r\nbefore he succeeded in finding Ruth.\r\n\r\nThey reached their home on the island at Milton. They afterward lived at\r\nJaysburg, the present Williamsport. Descendants of the sturdy people are\r\nnow residents of that city.\r\n\r\nAmong those taken captive were Peter Wyckoff and son, Cornelius; Thomas\r\nCovenhoven and a Negro. The latter was burned in the presence of the\r\nother prisoners. Peter Wyckoff was fifty-four years old, and lived with\r\nthe Indians two years before he and his son were given their freedom.\r\n\r\nThis affair occurred in the present city of Williamsport, where West\r\nFourth Street crosses the stream which flows down Cemetery Street. There\r\nis a boulder erected near the spot which bears a bronze tablet telling\r\nof the event.\r\n\r\nAt the time this was a natural thicket of wild plum trees, which yielded\r\nfruit of remarkable size and flavor for nearly a century after the\r\nmassacre. The road leading to this spot was the old Indian trail and\r\nformed a safe place for the concealment of lurking savages.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Colonel William Crawford Captured by\r\n                         Indians June 11, 1782\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the spring of 1782 the Indians, who had removed the seat of their\r\ndepredations and war to the western frontiers of Pennsylvania, and\r\nEastern Ohio, assembled in large numbers at Upper Sandusky, Ohio, which\r\nthey used as place of general rendezvous and from which they went out to\r\nthe places they decided in council should be attacked and destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe principal places to which they made incursions were along the Ohio\r\nRiver, especially in Western Pennsylvania. So serious was the situation\r\nalong the frontier, and so bold had the savages become that Congress\r\ndirected a regiment of volunteers to be raised to subdue them.\r\n\r\nGeneral Washington commissioned Colonel William Crawford, of\r\nWestmoreland County, Pa., to command the regiment and David Williamson,\r\nLieutenant Colonel. These men were seasoned soldiers and unusually well\r\nqualified to lead troops against the Indians.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1782, the command marched from Fort Pitt, well armed and\r\nprovided with sufficient quantity of provisions. The command consisted\r\nof 462 officers and men. Each volunteer furnished his own horse, gun and\r\na month’s provision. They were to be exempt from two tours of military\r\nduty, and in the event they captured any Indian towns, such plunder as\r\nfell into their hands should be returned to its former owner, if he\r\ncould identify and prove his property, and all horses lost during the\r\nexpedition by unavoidable accident were to be replaced by horses taken\r\nfrom the Indians.\r\n\r\nAfter a fatiguing march of eleven days through the wilderness the\r\ncommand reached the site of Sandusky, but the inhabitants had moved\r\neighteen miles farther down the stream. The officers decided there were\r\nno Indian towns nearer than forty miles, and while refreshing their\r\nhorses the scouts advanced to search for Indian settlements. They had\r\nnot gone far when the savages were discovered in great numbers and\r\nadvancing toward them.\r\n\r\nColonel Crawford and his brave band advanced to meet the attack June 11,\r\n1782, and when they had reached a point only a short distance from the\r\ntown they were met by a white man bearing a flag of truce from the\r\nIndians, who proposed to Colonel Crawford that if he would surrender\r\nhimself and his men to the Indians, who were of overwhelming force,\r\ntheir lives would be spared, but if they persisted further in their\r\nexpedition and attacked the town they should all be massacred to the\r\nlast man.\r\n\r\nCrawford, while listening to the proposition, thought he recognized the\r\nbearer of it as one whose features were those of a former schoolmate and\r\ncompanion, one he knew by the name of Simon Girty, and with whom he had\r\nonly recently served in the same regiment in the Continental Army.\r\n\r\nCrawford sternly inquired of the traitor if his name was not Simon\r\nGirty. Answered in the affirmative, the colonel informed him that he\r\ndespised the offer he had made; that he would not surrender his army\r\nunless he was compelled to do so by a superior force.\r\n\r\nGirty returned and Colonel Crawford immediately commenced an engagement\r\nwhich lasted till darkness, without advantage to either side, when\r\nfiring ceased. The troops encamped in the woods a half mile from the\r\ntown. After refreshments they slept on their arms, so that they should\r\nnot be caught unprepared in a surprise attack.\r\n\r\nThe sentinels reported during the night that they were surrounded by\r\nIndians upon every side, except a narrow space between them and the\r\ntown. The officers consulted upon the best way of escape, for they\r\nrealized to fight was useless and to surrender meant death.\r\n\r\nColonel Crawford proposed to retreat through the ranks of the enemy in\r\nan opposite direction from the town. Lieutenant Colonel Williamson\r\nthought the better plan would be to march directly through the town,\r\nwhere there appeared to be no Indians. It was no time for debate.\r\n\r\nColonel Crawford with sixty followers retreated on the route he had\r\nproposed by attempting to rush the enemy, but every man was killed or\r\ncaptured, the colonel and his surgeon, Dr. Knight, being among the\r\nprisoners. Lieutenant Colonel Williamson, with the remainder of the\r\ncommand and the wounded of the day’s battle, set out the same moment\r\nColonel Crawford did, went through the town without losing a man, and by\r\nthe aid of experienced guides arrived at their homes in safety.\r\n\r\nThe next day the Indians paraded their prisoners and disposed of all of\r\nthem among the different tribes except Colonel Crawford and Surgeon\r\nKnight, who were reserved for a more cruel fate.\r\n\r\nAt the Indian council they were brought forward and seated in the center\r\nof the circle. The chiefs questioned Crawford on subjects relative to\r\nwar. They inquired who conducted the operations of the American Army on\r\nthe Ohio and Susquehanna Rivers the previous year; also who had led that\r\narmy against them with so much skill and such uniform success.\r\n\r\nCrawford very honestly and without suspecting any harm from his reply\r\npromptly stated that he was the man. Upon learning this, Chief Pipe, who\r\nhad lost a son in battle where Colonel Crawford commanded, left his\r\nstation in the council ring, stepped up to Crawford, blackened his face\r\nand at the same time told him he should be burned the next day.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Death of Colonel Crawford and Escape of\r\n                        Dr. Knight June 12, 1782\r\n\r\n\r\nThe terrible disaster which occurred to the Pennsylvania militiamen\r\nunder command of Colonel William Crawford, June 10, 1782, was one of the\r\nmost unfortunate which is recorded in annals of border warfare.\r\n\r\nThe Indians under Captain Pipe and Chief Wyngenim, Delaware chieftains,\r\nand that white savage Simon Girty, the renegade, had surrounded the\r\nmilitiamen and captured or killed the entire command, except a small\r\ndetachment under Lieutenant Colonel David Williamson, which made a\r\nmiraculous escape through the Indian town during the progress of the\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nThe following day Colonel Crawford, his son, Captain John Crawford;\r\nson-in-law, Major Harrison; nephews, Major Rose and William Crawford,\r\nDr. Knight and many other militiamen, who had been recruited in\r\nWestmoreland County, were being marched to the Indian towns, where they\r\nwere tortured according to Indian savagery.\r\n\r\nDr. Knight was informed he would be sent to the Shawnee town, but he and\r\nthe Colonel were to march to the place where the former was to be\r\nexecuted. During the march they saw five of their comrades in custody of\r\nthe Indians. They were all required to sit down, when a number of squaws\r\nand boys tomahawked the five prisoners. An elderly soldier among the\r\nfive, named John McKinley, from the Thirteenth Virginia, was killed, his\r\nhead cut off and kicked about upon the ground. The scalps of the other\r\nfour were slapped into the faces of Colonel Crawford and Surgeon Knight.\r\n\r\nAt this point Simon Girty came upon the scene in company with several\r\nIndians on horseback. Colonel Crawford engaged him in conversation and\r\nmade every possible offer for relief from his perilous situation,\r\noffering Girty any price to deliver him from the savages and their\r\ntorments. Girty heard his prayers with indifference.\r\n\r\nColonel Crawford was led to a post to which he was fastened. A pile of\r\nwood lay a few feet distant. The colonel was stripped naked and ordered\r\nto sit down on the fire which had been kindled, when the Indians began\r\nto beat him with sticks and their fists. They then bound the Colonel’s\r\nhands behind his back and fastened the rope with which he was tied to\r\nthis ligature.\r\n\r\nGirty stood and composedly looked on the preparations that were to be\r\nthe death of one of his former playmates; a hero by whose side he had\r\nfought. Crawford again pleaded with Girty to save him, but he refused to\r\nprocure him a moment’s respite or afford him the most trifling\r\nassistance. Crawford retorted that he would take it all patiently.\r\n\r\nThe rope was now pulled over the cross arm on the post so that the\r\nColonel’s arms were extended above his head, with his feet just standing\r\nupon the ground. The wood was placed in a circle around him at a\r\ndistance of a few feet, in order that his misery might be protracted and\r\nthe fire then applied to the wood at several places in the circle.\r\n\r\nAs the flames rose and the scorching heat became unbearable he again\r\nprayed to Girty in all the anguish of his torment to rescue him from the\r\nfire, or shoot him dead. Girty, with a demoniac smile, calmly replied\r\nthat he had no pity for his sufferings. Squaws took broad boards, heaped\r\nwith burning embers and threw them on him, so that he had nothing but\r\ncoals of fire to walk upon.\r\n\r\nDr. Knight who witnessed all of this horrible execution, related that\r\nColonel Crawford at this stage of his sufferings, prayed to the Almighty\r\nto have mercy on his soul. He bore his torments with the most manly\r\nfortitude. He suffered these extremities of pain nearly two hours, when,\r\nexhausted, he fell over. They then scalped him and repeatedly slapped\r\nthe bleeding scalp in the doctor’s face, remarking, “That was your great\r\ncaptain.” An old squaw laid a pile of coals upon his back and head where\r\nhis scalp had been removed, the Colonel raised himself upon his feet and\r\nbegan to walk around the post, but he soon expired. His body was\r\nentirely consumed.\r\n\r\nColonel Crawford was about fifty years old, was a patriot and hero. He\r\nhad been an intimate of General Washington and shared to an unusual\r\ndegree the confidence of that great man and soldier.\r\n\r\nSoon as brave Colonel Crawford had expired Girty went to Dr. Knight and\r\nbade him prepare for death. He told him he was to be burned in the\r\nShawnee town. He was led away during that night.\r\n\r\nThe Indian who had Dr. Knight in custody rode on horseback and drove his\r\ncaptive before him. During the march the doctor pleaded ignorance of the\r\nfate which was to befall him and assumed a cheerful countenance and\r\nasked him if it was true they were to live together as brothers in one\r\nhouse. This pleased the Indian, who replied yes. They traveled about\r\ntwenty-five miles that day.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak, June 12, the Indian untied Knight and began to make a fire.\r\nKnight took the heaviest dogwood stick he could find and in an unguarded\r\nmoment struck the Indian a terrible blow on the head, which so stunned\r\nhim that he fell forward into the fire. Knight seized his gun, blanket,\r\npowder horn, bullet bag and made off through the woods. He had a\r\nfatiguing tramp, many days without food or shelter. He reached the Ohio\r\nRiver, five miles below Fort McIntosh, twenty-one days after his escape,\r\nand at 7 o’clock in the morning of July 4, arrived safely at the fort.\r\n\r\nHe lived many years afterward and gave a thrilling narrative of the\r\ndefeat and cruel death of Colonel Crawford and his own miraculous\r\nescape.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Conrad Weiser and Family Arrive in\r\n                         America June 13, 1710\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the early days of the eighteenth century many Germans, or\r\n“Palatines” as they were called, came to America. Many of them settled\r\nnear Albany, New York.\r\n\r\nAmong these Germans were John Conrad Weiser and his son Conrad, who\r\narrived in New York June 13, 1710, and settled on Livingston Manor, in\r\nColumbia County, N. Y. Conrad was then a lad of fourteen, being born\r\nNovember 2, 1696, near Wurtemberg, Germany.\r\n\r\nThe company of which the Weisers were members did not prosper in their\r\nnew home; many of them starved. So in 1714 the Weisers removed to\r\nSchoharie, in the Mohawk Valley.\r\n\r\nThe removal made matters worse. The family had almost nothing to eat.\r\nThe friendly Mohawk chief, Quagnant, offered to take Conrad into his\r\nwigwam for the winter, and his father consented. The lad learned the\r\nMohawk language, but often wished himself back in his own poor home. “I\r\nendured a great deal of cold,” he said, “but by spring my hunger much\r\nsurpassed the cold.” Conrad did not then foresee how valuable his\r\nknowledge of Indian language and customs would become.\r\n\r\nConrad did not long remain at home after his return from the Mohawk\r\ncamp, but acted as an interpreter between the Dutch traders and the\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nThe son may have been headstrong and the sire harsh, at any rate the\r\nyouth left home and built himself a cabin in the neighborhood, earned a\r\ngood income by selling furs, and spent the greater part of the next\r\nfifteen years among the Indians. Evidently, however, he retained a\r\nrespect for the teachings of his ancestors, for he says: “I married my\r\nAnna Eve, and was given in marriage by Rev. John L. Haeger, Reformed\r\nclergyman, on 22d of November (1720), in my father’s house at\r\nSchoharie.” Weiser, the elder, was at that time in Europe.\r\n\r\nWhen Governor Keith, of Pennsylvania, heard of the plight of the Germans\r\nat Schoharie, he invited them to come to his colony, and promised them\r\ngood land. John Weiser, a leader of the colony, set out at the head of a\r\ncompany and cut a road through the woods to the Susquehanna. In rough\r\nboats they floated down stream to the mouth of Swatara Creek, which they\r\nfollowed up to the beautiful Lebanon Valley, where they settled along\r\nTulpehocken Creek.\r\n\r\nConrad Weiser and his young wife followed the elder Weisers, and settled\r\nnear Womelsdorf, where he continued to reside until a few years before\r\nhis death, when he removed to Reading.\r\n\r\nIt is said of Weiser that while on a hunting trip he met the great\r\nShikellamy, and that the vicegerent was well pleased with him, and\r\nparticularly so when he learned that Weiser could speak Mohawk. They\r\nbecame great friends.\r\n\r\nIn 1732 by special request of certain deputies of the Six Nations,\r\nWeiser was appointed by Lieutenant Governor Patrick Gordon, of\r\nPennsylvania, interpreter for the Iroquois Confederacy. His Indian name\r\nwas “Tharachiawakon.” From this time until his death he was identified\r\nwith the history of the Province in all its relations with the Indians.\r\nHis popularity and influence never waned, for he was honest in all his\r\ndealings.\r\n\r\nIn 1734 he was appointed a justice of the peace by the Pennsylvania\r\nGovernment and in the old French War was commissioned colonel and\r\nappointed to the command of all the forces that were raised west of the\r\nSusquehanna.\r\n\r\nWhen Shikellamy complained to the Governor of Pennsylvania that the\r\ntrade in liquor was causing the ruin of the Delaware and Shawnee, the\r\nGovernor asked him to come to Philadelphia to discuss the matter.\r\nShikellamy took with him Weiser, as interpreter, who he called “an\r\nadopted son of the Mohawk nation.”\r\n\r\nJames Logan saw the value an honest man like Weiser could render the\r\nProvince, and he was made an agent for Pennsylvania in dealing with the\r\nSix Nations. Weiser thus represented both the Indians and the whites.\r\nThe Iroquois declared that “Conrad Weiser is a good, true man, who will\r\nspeak our words and not his own.”\r\n\r\nWeiser entered also into the Indian affairs of Virginia and Maryland,\r\nand prevented those colonies from becoming involved in an Indian war.\r\nThis was done at a great Indian council at Lancaster, in 1744.\r\n\r\nWeiser was able, through his Indian friends to be kept informed of the\r\nFrench movements in the Ohio Valley. He early realized the importance of\r\nthe English country “at the forks of the Ohio.” He made a journey to the\r\nwestern tribes and concluded a most important treaty at Logstown in\r\n1748.\r\n\r\nSquatters encroached upon lands in the Juniata Valley, which incensed\r\nthe Indians so much that Conrad Weiser was sent to order them off the\r\nIndian lands. He succeeded in moving them off and then burned their\r\ncabins.\r\n\r\nFollowing Braddock’s defeat, Conrad Weiser led many delegations of\r\nIndians to Philadelphia, and they always were entertained at his home en\r\nroute. This hospitality was misunderstood by his neighbors, but his\r\nwell-known integrity saved him in the hour of his greatest peril.\r\n\r\nWhen the Indians committed so many murders in Penns Valley, at Mahanoy\r\nCreek and elsewhere, Weiser warned his neighbors at Tulpehocken, and\r\nwhen they gathered at his house for defense Weiser was made their\r\ncommander.\r\n\r\nAn ungrateful Pennsylvania Assembly failed to pay Weiser’s bills, and\r\nfor three years his accounts were unsettled. He refused to do further\r\nservice until his bills were paid, and as Weiser was in demand his\r\nexpense accounts were satisfied.\r\n\r\nAt the great Indian treaties at Easton Weiser was a prominent personage,\r\nand the final peace was due principally to his influence.\r\n\r\nWeiser was now past sixty years of age. His work was almost done. While\r\nvisiting near Womelsdorf he died July 13, 1760.\r\n\r\nWhen he died one of his associates remarked: “He has left no one to fill\r\nhis place.” An Iroquois orator declared: “We are at a great loss and sit\r\nin darkness.”\r\n\r\nIf all white men had been as just and friendly to the Indians as was\r\nthis Pennsylvania German, the history of our westward advance might have\r\nbeen spared some bloody chapters.\r\n\r\nIt is said that President Washington, standing at the grave of Weiser,\r\nin 1794, remarked that the services of the latter to the Government had\r\nbeen of great importance and had been rendered in a difficult period and\r\nposterity would not forget him.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  United States Flag Adopted by Act of\r\n                         Congress June 14, 1777\r\n\r\n\r\nOn June 14, 1777, Continental Congress resolved “that the flag of the\r\nthirteen United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white;\r\nthat the union be thirteen stars, white, in a blue field, representing a\r\nnew constellation.”\r\n\r\nThe flag was a modification of the so-called “Great Union Flag,” used\r\nsince January 2, 1776, when it was raised in the camp on Prospect Hill.\r\nBefore that time different flags had been used under authority of the\r\nseveral provinces.\r\n\r\nIn autumn, 1775, Philadelphia floating batteries used a white flag, tree\r\nin the field, motto “An Appeal to Heaven.” The “Great Union” flag had\r\nthe thirteen alternate stripes of red and white, with the union of the\r\nBritish Union Jack. The Philadelphia Light Horse, which escorted\r\nWashington on his way out of the city on the morning of June 21, 1775,\r\nto his command of the American forces at Cambridge, carried a flag of\r\nalternate stripes.\r\n\r\nThe popular idea was a flag of thirteen stripes, alternate red and\r\nwhite, emblematic of the thirteen original colonies. The field of blue\r\nwith the King’s colors acknowledged fealty to the King, but though the\r\nAmericans were in arms against the mother country, they still hoped that\r\nthe English Parliament would repeal the obnoxious laws and restore to\r\nthe colonists those English rights that were theirs by inheritance and\r\nby royal colonial charters.\r\n\r\nUp to January 1, 1776, the Americans had no red, white and blue flag.\r\nThis popular design of a flag was called “Washington’s Grand Union”\r\nflag, and it was first unfurled by Washington over the camps at\r\nCambridge, Mass., January 2, 1776, when it was saluted with thirteen\r\nguns and thirteen cheers.\r\n\r\nWhen the committee appointed by Congress to prepare a design for a new\r\nflag, consisting of General George Washington, Robert Morris and Colonel\r\nGeorge Ross, called upon Mrs. Elizabeth (Betsy) Ross, at her home, 239\r\nArch street, Philadelphia, there was not much change in the popular\r\nensign, only the displacement of the British union by thirteen white\r\nstars.\r\n\r\nAs the act of Congress did not specify the number of points of the stars\r\nor their arrangement, Mrs. Ross suggested that a star of five points\r\nwould be more distinct, pleasing and appropriate than the six-pointed\r\nstar which the committee had designed. Folding a piece of paper, she\r\ncut, with a single clip of her scissors, a five-pointed star, and,\r\nplacing it on a blue field, delighted the committee with her taste,\r\ningenuity and judgment. The committee decided the thirteen stars should\r\nbe arranged in a circle, typifying eternity.\r\n\r\nBetsy Ross had been making colonial flags for the army and navy, and was\r\nskilled in needlework. The committee was well pleased with the flag\r\nwhich she made, and authorized her, in the name of Congress, to make\r\nUnited States flags. She continued in that occupation for many years.\r\n\r\nThe first display of the “Stars and Stripes” as the flag soon became\r\nknown, was August 3, 1777, over Fort Stanwix, now Rome, N. Y.\r\n\r\nThe first time the American flag was baptized in blood was at the Battle\r\nof Brandywine, September 11, 1777, which was only eight days after it\r\nwas officially adopted by Congress, September 3, 1777.\r\n\r\nThe first appearance on a foreign stronghold was at Nassau, Bahama\r\nIslands, January 22, 1778, when the Americans captured Fort Nassau from\r\nthe British.\r\n\r\nOn April 24, 1778, John Paul Jones achieved the honor of being the first\r\nofficer of the American navy to compel a British man-of-war to strike\r\nher colors to the new flag.\r\n\r\nJohn Singleton Copley, the American-born artist, in London, claimed to\r\nbe the first to display the Stars and Stripes in Great Britain. On the\r\nday when George III acknowledged the independence of the United States,\r\nDecember 5, 1782, he painted the flag of the United States in the\r\nbackground of a portrait which he was painting in his London studio.\r\n\r\nJanuary 13, 1794, the flag was changed by act of Congress owing to the\r\nnew States of Vermont and Kentucky being admitted to the Union. The flag\r\nnow had two stars and two stripes added to it. The act went into effect\r\nMay 1, 1795. This was the “Star Spangled Banner,” and under this flag\r\nour country fought and won three wars to maintain her existence; the\r\nso-called naval war with France, in 1798; that with the Barbary States\r\nin 1801–05, and that with England in 1812–15.\r\n\r\nOn April 4, 1818, Congress by act, decreed a return to the original\r\nthirteen stripes, and a star for every State in the Union to be added to\r\nthe flag on July 4, following a State’s admission to the Union. This is\r\nthe present law.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the stars on the flag is regulated by law and\r\nexecutive order. An executive order, issued October 26, 1912, provided\r\nfor forty-eight stars to be arranged in six horizontal rows of eight\r\nstars each.\r\n\r\nStarting in the upper left hand corner and reading each row from left to\r\nright gives the stars of each State’s ratification of the Constitution\r\nand admission to the Union, as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst row—Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia, Connecticut,\r\nMassachusetts, Maryland, South Carolina.\r\n\r\nSecond row—New Hampshire, Virginia, New York, North Carolina, Rhode\r\nIsland, Vermont, Kentucky, Tennessee.\r\n\r\nThird row—Ohio, Louisiana, Indiana, Mississippi, Illinois, Alabama,\r\nMaine, Missouri.\r\n\r\nFourth row—Arkansas, Michigan, Florida, Texas, Iowa, Wisconsin,\r\nCalifornia, Minnesota.\r\n\r\nFifth row—Oregon, Kansas, West Virginia, Nevada, Nebraska, Colorado,\r\nNorth Dakota, South Dakota.\r\n\r\nSixth row—Montana, Washington, Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, Oklahoma, New\r\nMexico and Arizona.\r\n\r\nToday the flags float over nearly every school house in the land. The\r\ncustom of having a flag displayed on all public buildings in the United\r\nStates was inaugurated by President Benjamin Harrison.\r\n\r\nJune 14 is now generally observed as Flag Day wherever floats the Stars\r\nand Stripes.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  French Plant Leaden Plates to Prove\r\n                      Possession on June 15, 1749\r\n\r\n\r\nThe treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, which was concluded October 1, 1748,\r\nsecured peace between Great Britain and France, and should have put an\r\nend to all hostile encounters between their representatives on the\r\nAmerican continent.\r\n\r\nThis treaty was supposed to have settled all difficulties between the\r\ntwo courts, but the French were determined to occupy the whole territory\r\ndrained by the Mississippi, which they claimed by priority of discovery\r\nby La Salle. The British complained to the French Government about\r\nencroachments being made by the French upon English soil in America.\r\n\r\nThe French deemed it necessary, in order to establish legal claim to the\r\ncountry which they believed to be theirs, to take formal possession of\r\nit. Accordingly, the Marquis de la Galissoniere, who was at that time\r\nGovernor General of Canada, dispatched Captain Bienville de Celeron with\r\na party of two hundred and fifteen French and fifty-five Indians to\r\npublicly proclaim possession and bury at prominent points plates of\r\nlead, bearing inscriptions declaring occupation in the name of the\r\nFrench King.\r\n\r\nCeleron started on June 15, 1749, following the southern shore of Lakes\r\nOntario and Erie, until he reached a point opposite Lake Chautauqua,\r\nwhen the boats were drawn up and carried over the dividing ridge, a\r\ndistance of ten miles. They followed down the lake and the Conewago\r\nCreek, where they arrived at what is now Warren, near the confluence of\r\nthe creek with the Allegheny River. Here the first plate was buried.\r\n\r\nThese plates were eleven inches long, seven and a half wide, and\r\none-eighth of an inch thick. The inscription was in French, and in the\r\nfollowing terms, as fairly translated into English:\r\n\r\n“In the year, 1749, of the reign of Louis XIV, King of France, We\r\nCeleron, commander of a detachment sent by Monsieur the Marquis de la\r\nGalissoniere, Governor General of New France, to re-establish\r\ntranquillity in some Indian villages of these cantons, have buried this\r\nplate of lead at the confluence of the Ohio with the Chautauqua this\r\n29th day of July, near the River Ohio, otherwise Belle Riviere, as a\r\nmonument of the renewal of the possession we have taken of the said\r\nRiver Ohio, and of all those which empty into it, and of all the lands\r\non both sides as far as the sources of the said river, as enjoyed or\r\nought to have been enjoyed by the King of France preceding, and as they\r\nhave there maintained themselves by arms and by treaties, especially\r\nthose of Ryswick, Utrecht and Aix-la-Chapelle.”\r\n\r\nThe burying of this plate was attended with much form and ceremony. All\r\nthe men were drawn up in battle array, when the commander, Celeron,\r\nproclaimed in a loud voice, “Vive le Roi!” and declared that possession\r\nof the country was now taken in the name of the King. A plate on which\r\nwas inscribed the arms of France was affixed to the nearest tree.\r\n\r\nThe same formality was observed in planting each of the other plates,\r\nthe second at the rock known as “Indian God,” on which are ancient\r\ninscriptions, a few miles below the present Franklin; a third, at the\r\nmouth of the Wheeling Creek; a fourth at the mouth of the Muskingum; the\r\nfifth and sixth, at the mouths of the Great Kanawha and the Great Miami.\r\n\r\nAt the last point, the party burned their canoes, and obtained ponies\r\nfor the return trip to the portage, when they returned to Fort\r\nFrontenac, arriving on November 6.\r\n\r\nThe Indians through whose territory this expedition passed viewed this\r\nplanting with great suspicion. By some means they got possession of one\r\nof the plates, generally supposed to have been planted at the very\r\ncommencement of their journey near the mouth of the Chautauqua Creek. An\r\naccount of this stolen plate, taken from the original manuscript journal\r\nof Celeron and the diary of Father Bonnecamps in Paris secured by Mr. O.\r\nH. Marshall, is interesting:\r\n\r\n“The first of the leaden plates was brought to the attention of the\r\npublic by Governor George Clinton to the Lords of Trade in London dated\r\nNew York, December 19, 1750, in which he states that he would send to\r\ntheir Lordships in two or three weeks a plate of lead full of writing,\r\nwhich some of the upper nations of Indians stole from Jean Coeur, the\r\nFrench interpreter at Niagara, on his way to the Ohio River, which\r\nriver, and all the lands thereabouts, the French claim, as will appear\r\nby said writing. He further states that the lead plates gave the Indians\r\nso much uneasiness that they immediately dispatched some of the Cayuga\r\nchiefs to him with it, saying that their only reliance was on him, and\r\nearnestly begged he would communicate the contents to them, which he had\r\ndone, much to their satisfaction and the interests of the English. The\r\nGovernor concludes by saying that ‘the contents of the plate may be of\r\ngreat importance in clearing up the encroachment which the French have\r\nmade on the British Empire in America.’ The plate was delivered to\r\nColonel, afterwards Sir William Johnson, on December 4, 1750, at his\r\nresidence on the Mohawk, by a Cayuga sachem who accompanied it by the\r\nfollowing speech:\r\n\r\n“‘Brother Corlear and War-ragh-i-ya-ghey: I am sent here by the Five\r\nNations with a piece of writing which the Seneca, our brethren, got by\r\nsome artifice from Jean Coeur, earnestly beseeching you will let us know\r\nwhat it means and as we put all confidence in you, we hope you will\r\nexplain it ingeniously to us.’\r\n\r\n“Colonel Johnson replied to the sachem and through him to the Five\r\nNations, returning a belt of wampum, and explaining the inscription on\r\nthe plate. He told them that, ‘it was a matter of the greatest\r\nconsequence, involving the possession of their lands and hunting grounds\r\nand that Jean Coeur and the French ought immediately to be expelled from\r\nthe Ohio and Niagara.’ In reply, the sachem said that ‘he heard with\r\ngreat attention and surprise the substance of the devilish writing he\r\nhad brought, and that Colonel Johnson’s remarks were fully approved.’ He\r\npromised that belts from each of the Five Nations should be sent from\r\nthe Seneca’s castle to the Indians at the Ohio, to warn and strengthen\r\nthem against the French encroachments in that direction.”\r\n\r\nOn January 29, 1751, Governor Clinton sent a copy of this inscription to\r\nGovernor Hamilton, of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe French followed up this formal act of possession by laying out a\r\nline of military posts, on substantially the same line as that pursued\r\nby the Celeron expedition, but instead of crossing over to Lake\r\nChautauqua, they kept on down to Presqu’ Isle, now Erie, where there was\r\na good harbor, with a fort established, and then up to Le Boeuf, now\r\nWaterford, where another post was placed; thence down the Venango River,\r\nnow called French Creek, to its mouth at Franklin, establishing Fort\r\nVenango there; thence by the Allegheny to Pittsburgh, where Fort\r\nDuquesne was seated, and so on down the Ohio.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Penns Secure First Manor West of Susquehanna\r\n                             June 16, 1722\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernor Sir William Keith’s visit to the Indians at Conestoga in June,\r\n1721, produced a strong impression upon the minds of the aborigines whom\r\nhe met. The chiefs of the Six Nations who had been present at this\r\nconference, told of its success to their people.\r\n\r\nThe Conestoga and other tribes of Indians along the Susquehanna River\r\nseemed to look upon Lieutenant-Governor Keith with almost the same favor\r\nand regard which they entertained for William Penn.\r\n\r\nKeith determined to secure a right and title to the lands in\r\nPennsylvania upon which Maryland settlers had encroached. He laid his\r\nplan for this purpose before he went to attend the conference at Albany,\r\nN. Y. where he was to meet Cayuga chiefs, who had offered some objection\r\nto the conclusion of the conference he had held with the Indians at\r\nConestoga in 1721.\r\n\r\nThe trouble along the border line between Maryland and Pennsylvania had\r\nbegun in Chester County, soon after the earliest settlements. The\r\nboundary continued to be a bone of contention until a temporary line was\r\nrun in 1739, and even this did not fully settle the difficulty, for\r\nthere was dispute until Mason and Dixon’s line was run 1767–8.\r\n\r\nGovernor Keith had frequent controversies with Governor Ogle, of\r\nMaryland, concerning encroachments in the southern part of Lancaster\r\nCounty.\r\n\r\nThe Marylanders were attempting to make settlements west of the\r\nSusquehanna, in the present York County.\r\n\r\nGovernor Keith conceived the idea of obtaining permission of the Indians\r\nalong the Susquehanna to lay off a large manor, as the proprietor’s\r\none-tenth, and he proceeded to Conestoga, early in June, 1722, for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nHere he called together the Conestoga, Shawnee, who lived farther up the\r\nriver, and the Ganawese, afterwards known as the Canoy, who lived at the\r\npresent site of Columbia.\r\n\r\nKeith had authority from the heirs of William Penn to lay off a manor\r\nwest of the river for the benefit of Springett Penn, the favorite\r\ngrandson of the founder of Pennsylvania and son of Richard Penn.\r\n\r\nThis conference was first assembled June 15. Here Governor Keith, with\r\npersuasive eloquence, commended the Indians for their virtues, praised\r\nthem for what they had already done for William Penn and his heirs, and\r\nobtained their consent to cross the river and make a survey of 70,000\r\nacres.\r\n\r\nGovernor Keith spoke at great length and earnestness. He began by\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n“Friends and Brothers: You say you love me because I come from your\r\nfather, William Penn. You call me William Penn, and I am very proud of\r\nthe name you give me; but if we have a true love for the memory of\r\nWilliam Penn, we must show it to his family and his children that are\r\ngrown to be men in England, and will soon come over to represent him\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\nHe then referred to the previous treaty where they showed him the\r\nparchment received from William Penn, and he then told the Indians of\r\nthe encroachments of the Marylanders.\r\n\r\nKeith then said he came to consult with them how they could prevent such\r\nsettlements and suggested the plan to take up a large tract of land on\r\nthe other side of the Susquehanna River for Springett Penn.\r\n\r\nHe told the Indians that Penn’s grandson was now a man as tall as he;\r\nthat the land should be marked with Springett’s name upon the trees, so\r\nthat the Marylanders would then keep off and it would also warn every\r\nother person from settling near enough to the Indians to disturb them.\r\nHe added that the grandson bore the same kind of a heart as his\r\ngrandfather did, and he would be glad to give the Indians part of the\r\nland for their use and convenience. With these and similar phrases Keith\r\nwon his point.\r\n\r\nAt a council held June 16, 1722, with Governor Keith, Colonel John\r\nFrench, Francis Worley, Esq., the chief of several tribes, and Smith and\r\nLe Tort, as interpreters, present, the Indians made reply through Chief\r\nTawena, and agreed to give up the land, but suggested that the Governor\r\ntake up the matter further with the Cayuga when he attended a treaty at\r\nAlbany.\r\n\r\nThe Indians requested that the surveyor begin his work immediately and\r\nnot wait until the Governor was absent at Albany.\r\n\r\nThe warrant was made out, and the surveyors, John French, Francis Worley\r\nand James Mitchell made a report of their survey, June 21.\r\n\r\nThis tract contained 75,500 acres and began opposite the mouth of\r\nConestoga Creek, at Lockport Run and ran south by west ten miles, thence\r\nnorthwest twelve miles to a point north of the present city of York.\r\nThence northeast eight miles to the Susquehanna River again, and from\r\nthence along the river to the place of beginning.\r\n\r\nThe exact positions and boundary lines of the original Springettsbury\r\nManor were never thoroughly understood, and there resulted much\r\ncontroversy about the survey.\r\n\r\nThe warrant and survey were not returned into the land office, but the\r\nentire transaction appeared to have been done under the private seal of\r\nGovernor Keith, and no actual purchase was ever made from the Indians,\r\nJune 15 or 16.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the Penn Manors began with the charter to William Penn,\r\nwhich contained several powers to erect manors.\r\n\r\nOn July 11, 1681, Penn agreed with the purchasers in England, who were\r\ninterested in his grant on certain conditions and concessions. The ninth\r\nof these was, that “in every one hundred thousand acres, the Governor\r\nand Proprietary, by lot, reserveth ten to himself which shall lie but in\r\none place.” The name of “Manor” was given to these portions of reserved\r\nland in its genuine legal sense.\r\n\r\nThere were eighty-two Proprietary manors set apart, fourteen in\r\nNorthumberland, twelve in Northampton, nine in Chester, seven each in\r\nPhiladelphia, Bucks, Lancaster, and Bedford, six in Westmoreland, four\r\nin Cumberland, and three each in York and Berks Counties. Three of the\r\nmanors were not located.\r\n\r\nThe largest in territory was Springettsbury, with Manor of Maske, in\r\nYork (now Adams) County, next in size with 43,500 acres. Fagg Manor in\r\nChester County, contained 39,250 acres. The smallest was Lake\r\nPaupunauming Manor, in Northampton County, which contained only 215\r\nacres.\r\n\r\nWhen the Revolution changed the form of government for Pennsylvania all\r\nthe confiscations by which lesser men were punished are cast into the\r\nshade by the great Divesting Act. The Proprietary family were deprived\r\nof their lordship of the soil of Pennsylvania, their unlocated and\r\nunappropriated lands and the quit rents which had been reserved outside\r\nof their manors. This was the destruction of the greatest private estate\r\nin the world, but it was necessary.\r\n\r\nThere were saved to the Penns all manors which had been surveyed for\r\nthem prior to July 4, 1776.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   British and Tory Refugees Evacuate\r\n                       Philadelphia June 17, 1778\r\n\r\n\r\nSir William Howe had found the occupation of Philadelphia a barren\r\nconquest, and the evacuation of the city was felt by General Washington\r\nto be so certain only a question of time that as early as March, 1778,\r\nhe began to collect wagons and organize teams for the transportation\r\nservice of his army, when it should be required to march after the\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nHowe’s proper point for operations was New York, and Washington felt\r\nsure he would return thither. Instead of that, however, Howe yielded to\r\nthe complaints at his supineness in England and, being desirous to\r\nreturn home, resigned.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Clinton, successor to General Howe, arrived in Philadelphia\r\nMay 8, and took formal command of the British Army May 11. Before Howe’s\r\ndeparture a fete was arranged May 18 in his honor called the Meschianza,\r\nand it comprised a regatta, tournament, feast and ball.\r\n\r\nLord Howe embarked for England May 24, and the same day Clinton held a\r\ncouncil of war. They were fearful that the French fleet would cut off\r\ntheir communication with England, also the knowledge that the American\r\ncapital was not of much importance to them after all, the fact that\r\nCongress had fled on wheels, and that Pennsylvania had remained loyal,\r\nthey resolved to evacuate Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nNot the least fear was for Washington’s army, now thoroughly drilled by\r\nBaron Steuben, a Prussian officer, who had come to Valley Forge in\r\nFebruary. This army now became a source of real danger to the British.\r\n\r\nBut the movement of the British troops was delayed, as on June 6 three\r\ncommissioners to effect peace, the Earl of Carlisle, William Eden and\r\nGeorge Johnston, arrived in Philadelphia. They were willing to gratify\r\nevery wish that America had expressed. But it was too late. Franklin and\r\nhis associates had secured an alliance with France and the American\r\nCongress refused to entertain such propositions.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Joseph Reed, one of Pennsylvania’s delegates in\r\nCongress, was offered £10,000 and the best office in the colonies if he\r\nwould promote the plans for peace; but he promptly replied: “I am not\r\nworth purchasing; but such as I am, the King of Great Britain is not\r\nrich enough to do it.”\r\n\r\nClinton’s army, accompanied by Tory refugees, evacuated Philadelphia\r\nJune 17, crossed the Delaware at Camden and Gloucester in great haste,\r\nwhile the fleet floated slowly down the bay.\r\n\r\nWashington learned of the retreat of the enemy and moved his army out of\r\nValley Forge, followed Clinton, and on Sunday, June 28, fought the\r\nBattle of Monmouth, which resulted in the precipitate flight of Clinton,\r\nwith the wreck of his army, to New York. About 800 of Clinton’s men\r\ndeserted, of whom seventy came to Philadelphia in one day.\r\n\r\nAn incident occurred following the Battle of Monmouth which exerted a\r\ngreater effect upon the American Army than many a skirmish between\r\nbrigades, for it ended the unfortunate “Conway’s Cabal.” Certain remarks\r\nupon General Conway’s behavior at the Battle of Germantown brought a\r\nchallenge from General Conway to General Cadwallader, who of all the\r\nAmerican high officers remained the most loyal friend, supporter and\r\nadmirer of General Washington.\r\n\r\nA duel was fought, in which Conway was severely wounded, and, believing\r\nhimself to be dying, repented and expressed to General Washington his\r\ngrief, adding, “My career will soon be over, therefore justice and truth\r\nprompt me to declare my last sentiments—May you long enjoy the love,\r\nveneration and esteem of these States whose liberties you have asserted\r\nby your virtues.”\r\n\r\nUpon the re-occupation of Philadelphia by the Continental Army, Major\r\nGeneral Benedict Arnold was ordered by General Washington to take\r\ncommand of the city and “prevent the disorders which were expected upon\r\nthe evacuation of the place and the return of the Whigs, after being so\r\nlong kept out of their property.”\r\n\r\nArnold occupied, during part of his stay, a handsome country estate,\r\nwhich is now in Fairmount Park, lived most extravagantly and married\r\nMargaret, popularly known as “Peggy” Shippen, daughter of one of\r\nGovernor Penn’s councillors, afterward Chief Justice of the State.\r\n\r\nOn June 25 the Supreme Executive Council took into consideration the\r\ncase of John Gilfray, boatswain of the ship Montgomery, found guilty of\r\ndeserting to the enemy and under sentence of death. It being the first\r\nconviction of an offense of this kind in the State fleet, he was\r\npardoned, and Commodore Hazelwood was authorized to offer full pardon to\r\nall deserters who returned before September 1.\r\n\r\nBeginning of this month, however, Lieutenant Lyon, of the “Dickinson,”\r\nand Lieutenant Ford, of the “Effingham,” who deserted during the attack\r\nupon Fort Mifflin, were executed on board of one of the guard boats on\r\nthe Delaware. Lieutenant Wilson, of the Rangers, and John Lawrence, one\r\nof the gunners of the fleet, who deserted at the same time and were\r\nunder sentence of death, were reprieved.\r\n\r\nActive measures were taken for the speedy trial of all persons accused\r\nof high treason, and the conviction of quite a number excited an intense\r\nsensation and much alarm among the Tories and Quakers. Several were\r\nexecuted, notwithstanding every exertion to save them. The Whigs had\r\nsuffered too severely at the hands of the disaffected, and some victims\r\nwere necessary to mollify the animosities.\r\n\r\nCongress closed its business at York and went back to Philadelphia, June\r\n25, and the State government left Lancaster the following day and again\r\nresumed their duties at Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nPresident Wharton died suddenly at Lancaster, May 23, and George Bryan\r\nwas made President of the Supreme Executive Council.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs now began to punish the Tories. The Assembly passed an “act\r\nfor the attainder of divers traitors,” among whom were Joseph Galloway,\r\nReverend Jacob Duché and the Allens. The Quakers and the German sects\r\nwere special objects of suspicion, because they thought it wrong to take\r\nup arms.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Provincial Conference Meets at Carpenters’\r\n                           Hall June 18, 1776\r\n\r\n\r\nIn April, 1776, the Assembly renewed its instructions to the\r\nPennsylvania delegates in Congress not to give their consent to a\r\nseparation or a change of the Proprietary Government. But Congress, May\r\n15, recommended State governments in the colonies, and declared that all\r\nauthority under the Crown should be totally suppressed.\r\n\r\nOn June 8, the day after Richard Henry Lee, in Congress, had proposed\r\nthe independence of the colonies, the Pennsylvania Assembly gave\r\ninstructions which neither advised nor forbade a declaration of\r\nindependence, but left the question to the “ability, prudence and\r\nintegrity” of the delegates. This doubtful action proved the end of the\r\nProprietary Assembly. Only once did it again have a quorum of its\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nInstead of allowing the State Government, as suggested by Congress, to\r\nbe formed by members of the Assembly sworn to support the King, the\r\npeople of Pennsylvania took the matter in their own hands and issued a\r\ncall for a provincial convention for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThis was the death blow to Proprietary authority. A public meeting held\r\nin Philadelphia sent a protest against the Assembly of the Province\r\nundertaking to frame a new government, as it derived its power from a\r\nroyal charter, and did not truly represent the people. The meeting\r\ncalled for a convention. Opposed to this was a remonstrance against\r\namending the constitution except by the authority provided in the\r\ncharter itself.\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of Independence had given the old State Government a\r\nmortal blow, and it soon expired without a sigh—thus ending forever the\r\nProprietary and royal authority in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the Committee of Correspondence for Philadelphia issued\r\na circular to all the county committees for a conference in that city on\r\nTuesday, June 18.\r\n\r\nOn the day appointed there was a meeting of the deputies at Carpenters’\r\nHall, which organized by electing Colonel Thomas McKean, president;\r\nColonel Joseph Hart, of Bucks County, vice president, and Jonathan B.\r\nSmith and Samuel C. Morris, both of Philadelphia, secretaries.\r\n\r\nThe conference was composed of twenty-five delegates from the city of\r\nPhiladelphia; eleven from the county of Philadelphia; five from Bucks;\r\nthirteen from Chester; nine from Lancaster; ten from Berks; five from\r\nNorthampton; nine from York; ten from Cumberland; three from Bedford;\r\nfive from Northumberland, and two from Westmoreland; a total of 107 of\r\nthe most representative and patriotic citizens to be found in the\r\nProvince.\r\n\r\nThe conference at once unanimously resolved: “That the present\r\ngovernment of this Province is not competent to the exigencies of our\r\naffairs, and\r\n\r\n“That it is necessary that a Provincial Convention be called by this\r\nConference for the purpose of forming a new government in the Province\r\non the authority of the people only.”\r\n\r\nPreparations were taken immediately to secure a proper representation in\r\nthe convention. The qualifications of an elector were defined. Every\r\nvoter was obliged to take an oath of renunciation of the authority of\r\nGeorge the Third, and one of allegiance to the State of Pennsylvania,\r\nand a religious test as prescribed for the members of the convention.\r\n\r\nThe following declaration was signed by all the deputies on June 24, and\r\npresented to Congress:\r\n\r\n“We, the deputies of the people of Pennsylvania, assembled in full\r\nProvincial Conference, for forming a plan for executing the resolve of\r\nCongress of the 15th day of May last, for suppressing all authority in\r\nthis Province derived from the Crown of Great Britain, and for\r\nestablishing a Government upon the authority of the people only, now in\r\nthis public manner, in behalf of ourselves, and with the approbation,\r\nconsent and authority of our constituents, unanimously declare our\r\nwillingness to concur in a vote of the Congress, declaring the United\r\nColonies free and independent States:\r\n\r\n“Provided, The forming the government and the regulation of internal\r\npolice of this Colony be always reserved to the people of the said\r\nColony; and we further call upon the nations of Europe, and appeal to\r\nthe Great Arbiter and Governor of the empires of the world, to witness\r\nfor us, that this declaration did not originate in ambition or in an\r\nimpatience of lawful authority, but that we were driven to it in\r\nobedience to the first principle of nature by the oppressions and\r\ncruelties of the aforesaid King and Parliament of Great Britain, as the\r\nonly possible measure that was left us to preserve and establish our\r\nliberties, and to transmit them inviolate to posterity.”\r\n\r\nThe Conference prepared an address to the Associators of Pennsylvania,\r\nwhich was adopted unanimously. This address issued particular\r\ninstructions to associators to exercise great care in the election of\r\ndelegates, charging them to select only the best men and to eschew all\r\nsuch as were in the proprietary interest.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the adoption of the Declaration of Independence was\r\nassumed as a fixed fact, for they expressed much greater anxiety in\r\nregard to the complexion of the Constitutional Convention of\r\nPennsylvania, which was to meet in Philadelphia July 15.\r\n\r\nAfter the adjournment of the Conference, on June 25, a dinner was given\r\nto the members at the Indian Queen Tavern, on Fourth Street. The toasts\r\nwere drunk to “The Congress,” “The Free and Independent States of\r\nAmerica,” “Washington,” “The Army and Navy,” “A Wise and Patriotic\r\nConvention to Pennsylvania on the 15th of July,” “Lasting dependence to\r\nthe enemies of independence,” etc.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania was truly on the brink of a crisis, and Congress was face\r\nto face with the question of independence and the expediency of an\r\nimmediate declaration of it and the instant severing of all ties binding\r\nthe united colonies to the mother country.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Massacre at Indian Town of Standing Stone\r\n                            on June 19, 1777\r\n\r\n\r\nAs an Indian post of ancient date, few are better known than Standing\r\nStone, the present site of the beautiful borough of Huntingdon, on the\r\nJuniata. It was here where two of the great Indian paths crossed, one\r\nleading on to Kittanning and the west, the other to Bedford and the\r\nPotomac. The earliest maps of which we have any record indicate that an\r\nimportant Indian village was situated at this point.\r\n\r\nStanding Stone was known to the Indians by the name of Achsinnink,\r\nmeaning original stone. The word alludes to a large rock, standing\r\nseparate and where there is no other rock.\r\n\r\nConrad Weiser has left us the oldest record of Standing Stone, August\r\n18, 1748, then seemingly already a well-known name of the place.\r\n\r\nJohn Harris, in 1753, wrote of Standing Stone as “about fourteen feet\r\nhigh and six inches square.” It stood on the right bank of Stone Creek,\r\nnear its mouth, and in such a position as to enable persons to see it at\r\nconsiderable distance, either up or down the river.\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Philip Fithian, in 1755, says it was “a tall stone column\r\nor pillar nearly square and seven feet above the ground.”\r\n\r\nThere have been conflicting opinions whether any of this original\r\nStanding Stone still exists or not, some holding to the belief that it\r\nwas used not only as a finger board at the crossing of the great Indian\r\npaths, but also contained the official record of the tribe.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the stone was carved with names and Indian\r\ncharacters, which depicted important epochs in the tribe’s history, its\r\nwars, mighty deeds, its prowess in battle, and, perhaps, its skill in\r\nthe chase. It also is quite possible that the stone was a sacred tablet\r\nto the memory of one or more noble chiefs who fell in battle. The stone\r\ncontained many hieroglyphics and each may have told a story in the\r\nIndian language.\r\n\r\nThis stone was once the cause of a war, when the Tuscarora tribe, living\r\nabout thirty or forty miles below on the river, declared war on the\r\ntribe at Standing Stone for some real or fancied insult, and for this\r\npurpose sent them repeated messages which the Standing Stone Indians\r\nfailed to heed. The Tuscarora awaited a time when their enemy warriors\r\nwere on a hunt, when they fell on the village with a great force,\r\ndriving away those who were at home, and carried the stone away. Upon\r\nthe return of the hunters the entire war force was immediately sent\r\nafter their enemy, who were soon overtaken, when a bloody conflict\r\nensued, and the stone was recaptured and carried back in triumph.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be an undisputed fact that the original stone was removed by\r\nthe Indians and carried away by them about 1755, at the time the Indians\r\nin that valley joined the French.\r\n\r\nA few white settlers seated themselves at Standing Stone in 1762 and\r\nbegan the erection of a stockade fort, but in the following spring were\r\nforced to abandon it, as well as their houses and other improvements,\r\nand fly to Carlisle for protection from the Indians.\r\n\r\nStanding Stone was laid out as a town in 1767 by the Reverend William\r\nSmith, D. D., the proprietor at that time and for many years afterward\r\nprovost of the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Smith called the town\r\nHuntingdon, in honor of Selina, Countess of Huntingdon, in England, a\r\nlady of remarkable liberality and piety, who, at the solicitation of Dr.\r\nSmith, had made a handsome donation to the funds of the University.\r\n\r\nThe old name Standing Stone, however, clung to the place for many years.\r\nNearly all the traders and military officers of the eighteenth century\r\nused the old name, and it is marked Standing Stone on the Lewis Evans\r\nmap of 1755 and 1770; it is “Standing Stone, Huntingdon,” on the Powell\r\nmap of 1776.\r\n\r\nOn the second stone erected at this place were found the names of John\r\nand Charles Lukens, Thomas Smith and a number of others, with dates\r\nvarying from 1768 to 1770, cut or chiseled in the stone. This stone\r\nseems to have been erected by one or other of the men whose names it\r\nbore, on the same spot where the original stone stood. This stone was\r\nsubsequently removed to a spot near the present court house in\r\nHuntingdon and forms the most valuable and interesting historic relic in\r\nthe Juniata county seat.\r\n\r\nThe only massacre to take place at Standing Stone occurred June 19,\r\n1777, at what was known as Big Spring, several miles west of the fort.\r\nThe Indians had infested the plantations and the inhabitants fled to the\r\nfort. Felix Donnelly and his son, Francis, and Bartholomew Maguire and\r\nhis daughter, residing near the mouth of Shaver’s Creek, placed their\r\neffects upon horses and, with a cow, started for the fort.\r\n\r\nJane Maguire was driving the cow ahead of the party, the Donnellys and\r\nMaguire bringing up the rear on the horses. When nearly opposite the Big\r\nSpring, an Indian fired from ambuscade and killed young Donnelly. His\r\nfather, who was close to him, caught him as he was falling from his\r\nhorse. Maguire rode to his side and the two men held the dead body of\r\nFrancis upon the horse.\r\n\r\nThe Indians rushed from their hiding place with terrific yells, and\r\nfired a volley at the party, one bullet struck Felix Donnelly, and\r\nanother grazed Maguire’s ear. Donnelly fell to the ground as did the\r\nbody of his dead son. The Indians rushed forward, scalped Francis and\r\nfollowed Jane, who succeeded in escaping, but not until she lost her\r\ndress when an Indian attempted to make her captive.\r\n\r\nSome men on the opposite bank of the stream, hearing the Indian yells\r\nand shooting, rushed to the scene. The Indians, not knowing their\r\nstrength, disappeared in the woods. Maguire and his daughter reached the\r\nfort and alarmed the garrison, which started in hot pursuit of the\r\nsavages but did not overtake them. The dead body of Francis Donnelly was\r\nburied in a vacant spot which now is a garden in the heart of the\r\nborough of Huntingdon.\r\n\r\nAmong those who figured in the thrilling drama about Standing Stone were\r\nthe Bradys, who later moved to the West Branch of the Susquehanna;\r\nColonel Fee, who gained renown in Captain Blair’s expedition against the\r\nTories, and the Cryder family, consisting of father, mother and seven\r\nsons, every one a hero.\r\n\r\nAt the organization of the new county in 1787, it took the name of\r\nHuntingdon, and Standing Stone became even more only a historic memory.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Moravians Dedicate First Church West of\r\n                       Alleghenies June 20, 1771\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first church building dedicated to the worship of God west of the\r\nAllegheny Mountains was the chapel built by Reverend David Zeisberger,\r\nat Friedenstadt, on the Big Beaver, in now Beaver County, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nIn 1743 Zeisberger was at Shamokin laboring as a Moravian missionary\r\namong the Indians, with the approbation and support of the great\r\nShikellamy. This mission was broken up in 1756, and for several years\r\nZeisberger assisted in ministering to the Christian Indians, for whom\r\nthe Provincial Government had provided a refuge in the barracks at\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\nPeace having been concluded at the end of the Pontiac War, Zeisberger\r\nled the remnant of these Indians to Wyalusing, on the North Branch of\r\nthe Susquehanna River, in Bradford County. Here Zeisberger established\r\nthe mission of Friedenschuetten, “tents of peace.” This mission\r\nprospered greatly, and much good was done among the Indians.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1767, he traversed the solitude of the forest and reached\r\nthe Munsee Indians, who were then living in what is now Forest County.\r\nThis pious missionary remained with these savages but seven days. They\r\nwere good listeners to his sermons, but every day he was in danger of\r\nbeing murdered. Of these Indians he wrote:\r\n\r\n“I have never found such heathenism in any other part of the Indian\r\ncountry. Here Satan has a stronghold. Here he sits upon his throne. Here\r\nhe is worshipped by true savages, and carries on his work in the hearts\r\nof the children of darkness.”\r\n\r\nHe returned to Friedenschuetten and labored there until the Six Nations\r\nsold the land in that part of the State, November 5, 1768.\r\n\r\nThe Six Nations had by this treaty sold the land from “under the feet”\r\nof the Wyalusing converts and the Reverend Zeisberger was compelled to\r\ntake measures for the removal of these Christian Indians, with their\r\nhorses and cattle, to some other field.\r\n\r\nThis company penetrated through the wilderness to the Allegheny River,\r\nand established a church at a Delaware town of three villages called\r\nGoschgoschunk, near the mouth of Tionesta Creek in which is now Venango\r\nCounty. Here they built a log chapel, planted corn and commenced the\r\nwork of evangelization.\r\n\r\nThey were soon rewarded by gaining a number of converts, among whom was\r\nthe blind old chief Allemewi, who was baptized with the name of Solomon.\r\n\r\nAs usual, however, their success excited opposition and their lives were\r\nthreatened by the hostile Indians, who called the converts “Sunday\r\nIndians” or “Swannocks,” a name of great opprobrium.\r\n\r\nWangomen, an Indian prophet, declared that he had a vision in which he\r\nwas shown by the Great Spirit that the white man had displeased him by\r\ncoming among the Indians; and the old squaws went about complaining that\r\nsince their arrival the corn was devoured by worms, that the game was\r\nleaving the country, and that neither chestnuts nor bilberries ripened\r\nany more.\r\n\r\nSome said, “The white men ought to be killed,” and, others agreeing,\r\nsaid, “Yes, and all the baptized Indians with them and their bodies\r\nthrown into the river.”\r\n\r\nThe name of the town, Goschgoschunk, meant “the place of the hogs,” and\r\nthe missionaries believed it was well named.\r\n\r\nIn 1769 they removed their converts to Lawunakhanna, on the opposite\r\nside of the river about three miles above Goschgoschunk. A strange thing\r\noccurred here in the friendly attitude of their old enemy, Wangomen. He\r\ncarried news of their success to Kuskuskee, a celebrated Delaware town\r\non the Beaver, in the present Lawrence County. From this place Chief\r\nPakanke sent Glikhickan, a celebrated Delaware warrior and orator, to\r\nrefute the teachings of the missionaries.\r\n\r\nGlikhickan listened to the preaching of Zeisberger, and received private\r\ninstructions in the Gospel, and was completely won by them.\r\n\r\nOn his return to Kuskuskee Glikhickan made a favorable report to\r\nPakanke, who invited the missionaries and their converts to remove to\r\nBeaver, where a tract of land was promised them for their exclusive use.\r\n\r\nZeisberger asked and received the consent of the Mission Board at\r\nBethlehem to accept the invitation, and he promptly prepared to remove\r\nthither.\r\n\r\nApril 17, 1770, the congregation at Lawunakhanna, set out in sixteen\r\ncanoes, passed down the river to Fort Pitt, and on to the mouth of the\r\nBig Beaver, where they arrived in the forenoon of April 23 and paddled\r\nup the stream to the falls. At this point a portage was necessary and it\r\ntook four days to carry their baggage and canoes around the rapids. Here\r\nthey were met by Glikhickan and others with horses, who assisted them in\r\nthis labor.\r\n\r\nFive days later Zeisberger tarried at New Kuskuskee to visit with\r\nPakanke, who received him with a genuine welcome.\r\n\r\nThe site of their new encampment was reached May 7. Corn was planted, a\r\nlarge hut for meetings of the congregation and smaller ones of bark for\r\ndwellings were put up and all were happy in their new home. This town\r\nwas called Friedenstadt, or “town of peace.”\r\n\r\nGlikhickan became a devoted friend of the Christians, and when he\r\nremoved to Friedenstadt old Pakanke attacked him publicly. Colonel\r\nGeorge Croghan used his influence to appease Pakanke and secure a fair\r\nhearing for the missionaries, and the labors of the brethren began to\r\nbear fruit.\r\n\r\nOn June 12 the wife of the blind chief Solomon was baptized. Six months\r\nlater Glikhickan and Genaskund were baptized. Glikhickan took the name\r\nof Isaac and became an assistant in the work of the Gospel.\r\n\r\nOn July 14 Zeisberger was adopted into the Munsee tribe and Pakanke was\r\npresent at the ceremony.\r\n\r\nJuly 23, Zeisberger laid out a new and larger town on the west side of\r\nthe Beaver, near the present Moravia. This was a more permanent\r\nsettlement. The houses were built of logs, with stone foundations and\r\nchimneys and the church was much larger. Here, too, they built a\r\nblacksmith shop and stockades.\r\n\r\nOther missionaries came from Bethlehem. On the one hand, they enjoyed\r\nsuccess in their work, and, on the other, they were subjected to much\r\ndisagreeable treatment by those still unfavorable to them, their lives\r\nbeing more than once seriously imperiled by visits of hostile and\r\ndrunken savages. But they continued their labors undaunted by trials and\r\npersecutions.\r\n\r\nMay 27, 1771, the foundation stone of the chapel was laid, and June 20\r\nthe house was dedicated with great rejoicings. In all probability this\r\nwas the first church building dedicated to the worship of God west of\r\nthe Allegheny Mountains.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Revolutionary Forces Threaten Executive\r\n                         Council June 21, 1783\r\n\r\n\r\nA change in the British Ministry had encouraged Dr. Benjamin Franklin to\r\nrenew his efforts for a peaceful adjustment, and after working with the\r\nutmost industry and skill throughout the summer and most of the autumn\r\nof 1782, he had the satisfaction of seeing his labors crowned with\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nA preliminary treaty of peace between the Colonies and Great Britain was\r\nsigned at Paris, November 30, 1782, but the news did not reach this\r\ncountry until March 12, 1783, when the packet George Washington, Captain\r\nJoshua Barney, arrived at Philadelphia with the joyful intelligence that\r\na treaty had been concluded, acknowledging the independence of the\r\nUnited States. This was the initial step necessary in the negotiations\r\nfor peace between all belligerents.\r\n\r\nOn March 23 the French cutter Triumph arrived at Philadelphia from\r\nCadiz, bringing the news that a preliminary treaty of peace had been\r\nsigned January 20, 1783.\r\n\r\nM. de Luzerne, the French Minister, at once issued an official\r\nnotification of the fact, directing French cruisers to cease\r\nhostilities. Intelligence of the state of affairs was also communicated\r\nto Sir Guy Carleton, who had succeeded Sir Henry Clinton as the British\r\ncommander-in-chief at New York.\r\n\r\nOn April 11, the British officers received official notice from home\r\nthat peace had been concluded, and the same day Congress issued a\r\nproclamation enjoining a cessation of hostilities.\r\n\r\nOn April 16 the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania made public\r\nannouncement of the happy event at the Court House, where the official\r\ndocument was read by the Sheriff in the presence of an immense concourse\r\nof people. The State flag was hoisted as usual on such occasions, at\r\nMarket Street wharf; church bells were rung amid general demonstrations\r\nof joy at the termination of the war. In the evening Charles Wilson\r\nPeale exhibited the patriotic transparencies which had done good service\r\non previous occasions, and one week later Thomas Paine published the\r\nlast number of the Crisis, in which he declared that “the times that\r\ntried men’s souls were over.”\r\n\r\nThe definite treaty of peace was signed at Versailles, September 3,\r\n1783, in which the United States was formally acknowledged to be\r\nsovereign, free and independent.\r\n\r\nOne of the first measures made necessary by the cessation of the war was\r\nthe exchange of prisoners. The soldiers of Burgoyne’s army were\r\nprincipally at Lancaster, and they were put in motion before the\r\nproclamation, and arrived in Philadelphia on their way to New York a day\r\nor two previous to the official announcement. The obstructions that had\r\nbeen placed in the Delaware River were removed and commerce resumed.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1783, a number of the non-commissioned officers and soldiers of\r\nthe Pennsylvania Line wearied, and exasperated by the delay in the\r\nsettlement of their claims, resolved to demand a redress of their\r\ngrievances and a prompt settlement of their accounts.\r\n\r\nA body of them accordingly marched from Lancaster toward the city of\r\nPhiladelphia, and although the Supreme Executive Council and Congress\r\nwere informed of their coming, no measures were taken to check the\r\nadvance of the malcontents.\r\n\r\nA committee of Congress requested the Executive Council to call out the\r\nmilitia in order to prevent the progress of the rioters, but the State\r\nauthorities took no action, in the belief apparently that the troops\r\ncould be conciliated.\r\n\r\nOrders were issued from the War Office that the soldiers be received\r\ninto the barracks and supplied with rations. On reaching the city they\r\nmarched to those quarters in good order and without creating any\r\ndisturbance.\r\n\r\nCongress and the Executive Council both held their sessions in the State\r\nHouse at this time.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, June 21, Congress not being in session, having adjourned\r\nfrom Friday until Monday, about thirty of the soldiers marched from the\r\nbarracks to the State House, where the Executive Council was in regular\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\nThey sent to that body a memorial in writing stating that as their\r\ngeneral officers had left them, they should have authority to appoint\r\ncommissioned officers to command them and redress their grievances. With\r\nthis demand went a threatening message that in case they refused, the\r\nsoldiers would be let in upon the Council, who must then abide by the\r\nconsequences. Only twenty minutes were given for the deliberation, but\r\nso insolent were the terms that the Council at once unanimously rejected\r\nthe proposition.\r\n\r\nThis action created a widespread alarm. Other bodies of soldiers joined\r\nthe mutineers, who now numbered 300. The president of Congress assembled\r\nthat body in special session and demanded that the militia of the State\r\nshould be immediately called forth in sufficient force to reduce the\r\nsoldiers to obedience, disarm them and put them in the power of\r\nCongress. Prior to the assembling of Congress at Carpenters’ Hall the\r\nsoldiers were at their barracks and all was quiet.\r\n\r\nA session of the Supreme Executive Council was held the following day,\r\nSunday, at the house of President Dickinson. That body did not agree on\r\nthe extreme measures of Congress. The result was that the latter,\r\ndissatisfied with the indisposition of the Council, adjourned to meet at\r\nPrinceton, N. J. This action of Congress was neither necessary nor\r\nprudent. It was prompted by pride and a disposition to construe an\r\nundesigned affront into the wanton insult, or it was in consequence of\r\nfear that was unjustifiable by the succession of events.\r\n\r\nThe promoters of this meeting escaped, but several of the ringleaders\r\nwere arrested and court-martialed. Two of the sergeants of the Third\r\nPennsylvania were sentenced to be shot, while several others were to\r\nreceive corporal punishment, but all were subsequently pardoned by\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nCongress remained during the summer at Princeton. The Assembly of\r\nPennsylvania, the Council, and prominent citizens of the State invited\r\nit to return to Philadelphia, and although Congress seemed pleased and\r\nsatisfied at the measures taken, yet they were ashamed to go back to a\r\ncity they had deserted so precipitately and carelessly, and they\r\nadjourned at Princeton to meet at Annapolis, Md.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Colonel Turbutt Francis Marches Provincial\r\n                    Troops to Wyoming June 22, 1769\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Connecticut people had gained complete possession of the Wyoming\r\nValley at the conclusion of the so-called first Pennanite-Yankee War, in\r\n1769.\r\n\r\nThese Yankees entered with enthusiasm upon their agricultural pursuit,\r\nwhile their surveyors were employed in running out the five townships\r\nwhich had been allotted to the actual settlers by the Connecticut\r\nauthorities. But no one supposed that peace and security were finally\r\nyielded them by their alert and powerful Pennsylvania opponents.\r\n\r\nCaptain Amos Ogden with the civil magistrate, Sheriff John Jennings, of\r\nNorthampton County, of which county the Wyoming Valley was then a part,\r\nappeared at the head of an armed party in the plains May 20. They found\r\nthe Yankees too strongly entrenched and returned to Easton.\r\n\r\nSheriff Jennings informed Governor John Penn that the intruders mustered\r\nthree hundred able bodied men, and it was not in his power to collect\r\nsufficient force in Northampton County to dislodge them.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that the Governor sent Sheriff Jennings to Wyoming, he\r\nsent instructions to Colonel Turbutt Francis, who was then commandant of\r\nthe garrison at Fort Augusta, to extend such aid as was necessary to\r\nsecure the Proprietary settlements at Wyoming, and to hold his troops in\r\nreadiness for any emergency or call that he might make for them.\r\n\r\nThe records of Fort Augusta, or those published in the Archives do not\r\ngive much detailed information of the instructions which Colonel Francis\r\nreceived, but in a long report of the committee of the Susquehanna\r\nCompany, written from Windham, Connecticut, and signed by four members,\r\nis this paragraph:\r\n\r\n“June 22nd, 1769, Colonel Francis, with sixty armed men in a hostile\r\nmanner demanded a surrender of our houses and possessions. He embodied\r\nhis forces within thirty or forty rods of their dwellings, threatened to\r\nfire their houses and kill our people, unless they surrendered and\r\nquitted their possessions, which they refused to do, and after many\r\nterrible threatenings by him, he withdrew. Our people went on peaceably\r\nwith their business.”\r\n\r\nMiner, in his History of Wyoming, says of this event: “Col. Turbutt\r\nFrancis, commanding a fine company from the city, in full military\r\narray, with colors streaming, and martial music, descended into the\r\nplain, and sat down before Fort Durkee about the 20th of June; but\r\nfinding the Yankees too strongly fortified, returned to await\r\nreinforcements below the mountains.”\r\n\r\nOn June 15 Major Durkee, and others of the New England adherents went to\r\nEaston to attend the Northampton County Court, but the case against the\r\nYankees was continued to the September term, and the defendants returned\r\nwith Major Durkee to Wyoming.\r\n\r\nIt was during Major Durkee’s absence that the exciting events took\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nColonel Francis was a native of Philadelphia and a distinguished officer\r\nof the French and Indian War, since which service he had spent the\r\ngreater part of his life in and about Fort Augusta. He was in command of\r\nthe garrison at that fortress when Governor Penn sent him to Wyoming,\r\nand his troops were in the provincial service.\r\n\r\nA Yankee report of this event says: “The 22d of June our spies gave\r\nfresh information, that the mob was on their way, and they judged their\r\nnumber consisted of between 60 and 70, and in the evening they came and\r\nstrung along the opposite side of the River for more than a mile,\r\njudging by their whooping, yelling and hideous noise and firing of guns.\r\n\r\n“The 23d, in the morning, one Captain Ogden, with two more, came to know\r\nif our committee could be spoke with by Colonel Francis, which was\r\nconsented to. About 8 in the morning the Colonel came, seemingly in an\r\nangry frame by his looks and behavior. He told us he had orders from the\r\nGovernor of Pennsylvania to remove us off (which he in a short time\r\ncontradicted), and demanded entrance into our town, which was refused;\r\nand continued he—'You have lost your case at Easton, and I have 300 men\r\nhere with me, and 100 more coming, and my men are so unruly and\r\nungoverned that it is hardly in my power to keep them from you; and they\r\nwill kill your cattle and horses, and destroy your corn, and block up\r\nthe way so as to cut you off from all communication for provisions, and\r\nyour Government will not own you.'\r\n\r\n“We told him that we had a good right to the land by Charter from the\r\nCrown, and Deed from the Indians, and that we could not, consistent with\r\nthe votes of the Susquehanna Company, give it up, and should not. He\r\nthen made proposals of agreement that we should possess the land on the\r\nEast Branch, except that what Ogden and some others of them improved,\r\nand they enjoy the West Branch, till decided by law; and he would give\r\nus an hour to consider, and give him an answer. We sent him word that we\r\nwould not comply with his terms, for it was not in our power.\r\n\r\n“Finally he concluded to move off with his mob to Shamokin (which is\r\nabout 60 miles) and wait there about ten days for the committee to send\r\nour proposals, which, if he liked, it was well; if not, he could come\r\nagain. And further, he desired our men might be kept in the Fort till\r\nhis men should be gone, lest they should hurt us. Towards night they\r\nmoved off, seemingly well pleased with their _Conquest_. As near as we\r\ncould learn their number did not exceed 50 men, and a considerable part\r\nof them in our favor.”\r\n\r\nColonel Francis was called to Philadelphia in July and gave a full\r\nverbal report of his expedition to the Governor and Council.\r\n\r\nIn September thirteen of the Connecticut settlers in three canoes loaded\r\nwith flour were halted at Fort Augusta. They were on their way up the\r\nriver with the cargo which they had purchased at Harris’ Ferry for the\r\nWyoming settlement.\r\n\r\nThe Yankees were detained by armed troops for three hours, but their\r\ncargoes were confiscated, even in spite of the fact they agreed to pay\r\nfor the food.\r\n\r\nThus the trouble between the Connecticut and Pennsylvania claimants\r\ncontinued for many years.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Pennsylvanian Makes First Report in Congress\r\n                         for Railway to Pacific\r\n                             June 23, 1848\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Pollock had exhibited unusual personal and political strength in\r\ncarrying at three consecutive elections his Democratic congressional\r\ndistrict. He was first chosen to fill a vacancy occasioned by the death\r\nof Congressman General Henry Frick, then again in 1844 and 1846 he won\r\nhis re-election. He was one of the younger members, but during his\r\nnearly six sessions of service he exhibited not only great efficiency,\r\nbut he was in advance of most of his older associates in heartily\r\nsustaining all progressive movements.\r\n\r\nPollock was one of the few members of Congress who took kindly to\r\nProfessor S. B. Morse, when he went to Washington and was shunned by\r\nnearly every Government official as a crank or lunatic because he\r\nproposed to utilize the lightning for the transmission of messages.\r\n\r\nPollock also was one of the earliest public men to accept Benton’s idea\r\nof the great destiny of the West after the extension of our territory to\r\nthe Pacific by Mexican annexation. He served on the Committees of\r\nClaims, Territories, and in the Thirtieth Congress he was on the\r\nimportant Committee of Ways and Means.\r\n\r\nOn June 23, 1848, Pollock offered a resolution for the appointment of a\r\nspecial committee to inquire into the necessity and practicability of\r\nconstructing a railroad to the Pacific Coast. As chairman of that\r\ncommittee he made a report to the House in favor of the construction of\r\nsuch a road which was the first favorable official act on the subject on\r\nthe part of the Congress of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe report discussed the question in its international and domestic\r\naspects, its feasibility and probable results. The opening paragraph is\r\nin these words:\r\n\r\n“The proposition at first view is a startling one. The magnitude of the\r\nwork itself, and the still greater and more magnificent results promised\r\nby its accomplishment—that of revolutionizing morally and commercially,\r\nif not politically, a greater part of the habitable globe, and making\r\nthe vast commerce of the world tributary to us—almost overwhelm the\r\nmind. But your committee, on examination, finds it a subject as simple\r\nas it is vast and magnificent, and sees no insurmountable difficulties\r\nin the way of its successful accomplishment.”\r\n\r\nA bill accompanied the report, and was referred to the Committee of the\r\nWhole, but no further action was taken on it at that time, and Pollock\r\nsoon after left Congress. In the fall of 1848, however, he delivered a\r\nlecture on the Pacific Railroad, by invitation to a crowded house at\r\nLewisburg, Union County, closing with the following remark:\r\n\r\n“At the risk of being insane, I will venture the prediction, that in\r\nless than twenty-five years from this evening a railroad will be\r\ncompleted and in operation between New York and San Francisco, Calif.;\r\nthat a line of steamships will be established between San Francisco,\r\nJapan and China; and there are now in my audience, ladies who will,\r\nbefore the expiration of the period named, drink tea brought from China\r\nand Japan by this route, to their own doors.”\r\n\r\nThat prophetic announcement was received by the audience with a smile of\r\ngood-natured incredulity, but some of those very ladies, during the year\r\n1869, were able to sip their favorite beverage in exact accordance with\r\nthe terms of the speaker’s prediction. On May 10, 1869, the last rail\r\nwas laid, the last spike driven, and the great Pacific Railway, so long\r\nin embryo, became an accomplished fact.\r\n\r\nPollock gave special interest during his Congressional service to the\r\nannexation of Texas, the Mexican War, the acquisition of California, the\r\nrepeal of the Tariff Act of 1842, and the “Wilmot Proviso,” in its\r\napplication to the newly acquired territories of the United States. In\r\nall the discussions on those exciting topics he was the leading factor.\r\nHis speeches and votes demonstrated the consistency of his views, and\r\nthe breadth and soundness of his understanding.\r\n\r\nIn 1850 he became President-Judge of the eighth judicial district, then\r\ncomposed of the counties of Northumberland, Montour, Columbia, Sullivan\r\nand Lycoming.\r\n\r\nIn 1854 he was nominated and elected by a large majority Governor of\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\nIt was during his administration, May 16, 1857, that the main line of\r\nthe public works of the State was directed to be sold. On July 25\r\nfollowing Governor Pollock caused the same to be done, and on July 31\r\nthe whole line of the public works between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh\r\nwas transferred to the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, at the price of\r\n$7,500,000.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1857 a serious financial revulsion occurred, resulting\r\nin the suspension of specie payments by the banks of Pennsylvania and\r\nother States of the Union, followed by the failure of many\r\nlong-established commercial houses, leading to the destruction of\r\nconfidence and to the general depression of trade, and threatening to\r\naffect disastrously the credit of the Commonwealth and the great\r\nindustrial interests of the people.\r\n\r\nIn order to release the banks from the penalties incurred by a\r\nsuspension of specie payments, Governor Pollock convened the Legislature\r\nin “extraordinary session” October 6.\r\n\r\nOn October 13 an act was passed “providing for the resumption of specie\r\npayments by the banks and for the relief of debtors,” to go into\r\nimmediate effect. The law had the desired result, the different branches\r\nof industry revived and the community saved from bankruptcy and ruin. He\r\ndeclined a renomination for a second term.\r\n\r\nWhile serving in Congress, Pollock became intimately acquainted with\r\nAbraham Lincoln, who was then also a member, and they boarded at the\r\nsame house.\r\n\r\nThis friendship was renewed after Lincoln became President, when he\r\ncalled Pollock to Washington to consult with him upon the grave\r\nquestions confronting the country and to consult with him regarding\r\ncertain men he was considering for his Cabinet. In 1861 President\r\nLincoln appointed his Director of the Mint at Philadelphia, and it was\r\nthrough his efforts, while so serving, that the motto, “In God We\r\nTrust,” was placed upon our coins.\r\n\r\nGovernor Pollock died at Lock Haven April 19, 1890, and his body was\r\ninterred in the cemetery at Milton.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               John Binns, English Politician and Editor,\r\n                           Died June 24, 1860\r\n\r\n\r\nEditor John Binns died in Philadelphia June 24, 1860, at the advanced\r\nage of eighty-eight years, each one of which was one of prominence,\r\neither in England or America.\r\n\r\nIn 1854 he wrote the “Recollections of the Life of John Binns;\r\nTwenty-nine Years in Europe and Fifty-three in the United States.” In\r\nthe introduction he says:\r\n\r\n“Soon after my arrival in the United States, which was on the first day\r\nof September, 1801, I was urged by the late Dr. Joseph Priestley, his\r\nson Joseph, and Thomas Cooper, Esq., to write my life. They were among\r\nmy earliest American acquaintances, and continued my zealous and\r\nfaithful friends to their death. Some few American gentlemen who have\r\nsubsequently, in Philadelphia, read the account of my arrest and\r\nexamination before the Privy Council in London, and my trials for\r\nsedition and high treason in 1797 and 1798, have also urged me to\r\npublish my Recollections. Let these facts be received as an apology for\r\nthis publication.”\r\n\r\nJohn Binns was born in Dublin, Ireland, son of John and Mary Pemberton\r\nBinns. His father’s family were Moravians; his mother’s Episcopalians.\r\nHis father was drowned at sea when John was two years old. He left a\r\ncomfortable estate, and John and his brother and sister received a\r\nliberal education. His mother married again when John was yet in school.\r\n\r\nWhen fourteen years old John Binns was apprenticed to a soap boiler, but\r\non the death of his grandfather he purchased his apprentice fee and took\r\na deep interest in politics. He left Dublin April, 1794, and went to\r\nLondon. Then his troubles began.\r\n\r\nJohn Binns was first arrested March 11, 1796, at Birmingham, and\r\nconfined in the dungeon, but his trial was postponed until August. In\r\nthe interim he returned to Dublin, but returned for his trial, when he\r\nwas acquitted.\r\n\r\nHe was soon again arrested together with two celebrated politicians at\r\nMargate and imprisoned at London. He was discharged and again rearrested\r\non a charge of high treason, then sent to the Tower of London, from\r\nwhich he was removed to Maidstone Jail. He was again tried and\r\nacquitted, following a serious riot in court, May 24, 1798. He was next\r\narrested and imprisoned in Gloucester, where he was frequently visited\r\nby many persons of distinction.\r\n\r\nDuring this imprisonment Binns determined he would go to the United\r\nStates as soon as liberated. July 1, 1801, he embarked for Baltimore,\r\narriving there September 1 after a stormy and perilous voyage.\r\n\r\nUpon his arrival he loaded his goods on three wagons and set out on foot\r\nfor Northumberland, Pa., where he purposed to reside. At Harrisburg he\r\nhired a boat to take his goods and himself as a passenger up the river\r\nto Northumberland.\r\n\r\nBinns was given a hearty welcome by Dr. Priestley and Judge Cooper, and\r\nsoon became a most prominent resident. He was invited to deliver the\r\noration on July 4, 1802, and his effort stamped him as a most learned\r\nand eloquent speaker.\r\n\r\nBinns established the Republican Argus at Northumberland, and his\r\nsuccess exceeded his fondest expectations. It soon became one of the\r\nprominent papers of the State. He was a bold and determined man and\r\nwielded a severe pen.\r\n\r\nDecember 14, 1805, Binns fought a duel with Samuel Stewart, of\r\nWilliamsport, a member of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1807, friends in Philadelphia urged him to remove to that\r\ncity and establish a Democratic newspaper. He sounded members of the\r\nQuid Party and found them willing to support Snyder, but they would not\r\ndo so under the leadership of William Duane, editor of the Aurora.\r\n\r\nBinns removed to Philadelphia and established the Democratic Press,\r\nMarch 27, 1807. This was the first paper which used the word\r\n“Democratic” in its title.\r\n\r\nMay 15 Binns delivered the “Long Talk” before the Tammany Society, which\r\ncaused him in September to be dismissed from the society. Then the fight\r\nbetween the Aurora and Democratic Press opened in all its fury, and the\r\nbattle for the leadership between Duane and Dr. Leib on one side and\r\nJohn Binns on the other was commenced.\r\n\r\nBinns came out against Dr. Leib for Assembly and Duane for the Senate.\r\nThe former was elected, but Duane was badly beaten. This was the\r\nAurora’s first defeat and it groaned aloud.\r\n\r\nBinns was powerful in the election of Snyder in 1808. He had brought\r\nback the Constitutional Republicans into the fold and was able to\r\ncontrol the party against both Duane and Leib.\r\n\r\nDr. Leib was elected to the United States Senate early in 1809, but\r\nGovernor Snyder’s course was by no means pleasing to Duane. The Press\r\ndefended him, while the Aurora criticized everything he did. The Aurora\r\nthreatened to impeach the Governor, and Binns called the Aurora and its\r\nsupporters “The Philadelphia Junto.”\r\n\r\nBinns and his party favored war with England, and here again he came\r\ninto opposition with “Leib, Duane & Co.,” as the Press called them.\r\n\r\nDuane and Leib lost all control of the Legislature. In 1811 the\r\nFederalists were successful, and Snyder was overwhelmingly re-elected.\r\nThe Aurora published nothing about the impending war, the Press\r\nsupported every movement which forwarded its progress, and this was the\r\npopular side. Governor Snyder appointed his friend Binns as\r\naide-de-camp, and he was active throughout the war.\r\n\r\nLeib was appointed Postmaster at Philadelphia in February, 1814, but\r\nBinns succeeded in having Postmaster General Granger removed, and his\r\nsuccessor immediately removed Leib, who then disappeared from the\r\npolitical field.\r\n\r\nDuane soon followed Leib into political obscurity and Binns was in the\r\nzenith of his power. Had Binns not quarreled with Findlay soon as his\r\nelection he would have held his power for many more years. It was\r\nparticularly unfortunate that he opposed the election of Andrew Jackson\r\nin 1824 and afterward.\r\n\r\nHe was appointed an alderman by Governor Hiester in 1822, a position he\r\nheld for many years.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic Press was issued for the last time on November 14, 1829,\r\nit having been absorbed by the Philadelphia Inquirer.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 Binns published “A Digest of the Laws and Judicial Decisions of\r\nPennsylvania Touching of Authority of Justices of the Peace,” which was\r\nrevised and republished under the title “Magistrate’s Manual,” a book\r\npopularly known as “Binns’ Justice.”\r\n\r\nBinns held a number of positions of honor and trust, among which was\r\ndirectorship of the Pennsylvania Bank.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               First Deed for Chester County Conveyed to\r\n                      William Penn, June 25, 1683\r\n\r\n\r\nThe territory now included in Chester County was honorably purchased of\r\nthe Indians by William Penn and conveyed in several distinct deeds. The\r\nfirst, bearing date June 25, 1683, and signed by an Indian called\r\nWingebone, conveys to William Penn all his lands on the west side of the\r\nSchuylkill, beginning at the first falls and extending along and back\r\nfrom that river, in the language of the instrument, “so far as my right\r\ngoeth.”\r\n\r\nBy another deed of July 14, 1683, two chiefs granted to the Proprietary\r\nthe land lying between the Chester and Schuylkill Rivers. From\r\nKekelappan and Machaloa, the Conestoga chiefs, he purchased half the\r\nland between the Susquehanna and the Delaware in September, and from\r\nMalchaloa all the lands from the Delaware to Chesapeake Bay up to the\r\nfalls of the Susquehanna in October.\r\n\r\nThese were all the land transactions Penn had with the Indians in 1683\r\nof which the conveyances have been recorded.\r\n\r\nBy a deed of July 30, 1684, Shakhoppoh, Secane and Malibor conveyed the\r\nland between the Chester and Pennypack Creeks. Another conveyance was\r\nmade on October 2, 1685, for the greater portion of the lands\r\nconstituting the present county of Chester. This last instrument is a\r\nquaint piece of conveyancing and shows the value attached by the natives\r\nto their lands.\r\n\r\n“This indenture witnesseth that we, Packenah, Jackham, Sikals,\r\nPortquesott, Jervis, Essepenaick, Felkstrug, Porvey, Indian kings,\r\nsachemmakers, right owners of all lands from Quing Quingus, called Duck\r\ncr., unto Upland, called Chester cr., all along said west side of\r\nDelaware River, and so between the said creeks backwards as far as man\r\ncan ride in two days with a horse, for in consideration of these\r\nfollowing goods to us in hand paid, and secured to be paid by William\r\nPenn, Proprietary of Pennsylvania and the territories thereof, viz.; 20\r\nguns, 20 fathoms match coat, 20 fathoms stroud water, 20 blankets, 20\r\nkettles, 20 pounds of powder, 100 bars of lead, 40 tomahawks, 100\r\nknives, 40 pairs of stockings, 1 barrel of beer, 20 pounds of red lead,\r\n100 fathoms of wampum, 30 glass bottles, 30 pewter spoons, 100 awl\r\nblades, 300 tobacco pipes, 100 hands tobacco, 20 tobacco tongs, 20\r\nsteels, 300 flints, 30 pair of scissors, 30 combs, 60 looking glasses,\r\n200 needles, 1 skipple of salt, 30 pounds of sugar, 5 gallons of\r\nmolasses, 20 tobacco boxes, 100 jews harps, 20 hoes, 30 gimlets, 30\r\nwooden screw boxes, 103 strings of beads—do hereby acknowledge, &c., &c.\r\nGiven under our hands and seals, at New Castle, 2d of the 8th month,\r\n1685.”\r\n\r\nThe Quing Quingus Creek referred to Duck Creek, in present Delaware\r\nCounty, or to Appoquinimink Creek, which runs some distance north of\r\nDuck Creek.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1692, Kings Tamment, Tangorus, Swampes and Hickoqueon gave a\r\nconfirmatory deed of their former conveyances of land lying between\r\nNeshaminey and Poquessing Creeks, “upon the Delaware, and extending\r\nbackwards to the utmost bounds of the Province.” Taminy, his brother,\r\nand his three sons executed a second deed in confirmation of his former\r\nones, July 5, 1697, for lands between Neshaminy and Pennypack, extending\r\nbackward from the Delaware “so far as a horse can travel in two summer\r\ndays.”\r\n\r\nIn this last deed the grantors are described as: “Taminy, sachem, and\r\nWeheelam, my brother, and Weheequeckhon (alias Andrew), who is to be\r\nking after my death; Yaqueekhon (alias Nicholas), and Quenameckquid\r\n(alias Charles), my sons.” Weheequekhon was none other than the\r\ncelebrated Sassoonan, or Allummapees, head chief of the Delaware from\r\n1715 to 1747.\r\n\r\nThe title of the particular Indian chiefs to the lands claimed by them\r\nwas not always very clear, but it was the policy of the Proprietary\r\nGovernment to quiet all claims which might be made by purchasing them.\r\nAccordingly, purchases were made from time to time of claims made by\r\nchiefs which they alleged had not been extinguished by purchase.\r\n\r\nThe Indians, after the sale of their lands, continued to occupy them\r\nuntil needed by the settlers, and gradually abandoned them as the whites\r\nadvanced and took possession.\r\n\r\nThey were an amiable race, and when they left the burial places of their\r\nfathers, in search of new homes, it was without a stain on their honor.\r\nConsiderable numbers, however, remained in Chester County, inhabiting\r\nthe woods and unoccupied places, until the breaking out of the French\r\nand Indian War in 1755; about which time they generally removed beyond\r\nthe limits of the county and took up their abode in the valley of\r\nWyoming, at the Forks of the Susquehanna, and at Wyalusing in the North\r\nBranch of the Susquehanna.\r\n\r\nAt the making of the treaty of St. Mary’s, in 1720, there were present\r\nsome chiefs of the Nanticoke, one of whom had withstood the storms of\r\nninety winters, who told the commissioners that he and his people had\r\nonce roamed through their own domains along the Brandywine.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the Revolutionary War, the number of Indians resident in\r\nthe county was reduced to four who dwelt in wigwams in Marlborough\r\nTownship. After the death of three of them, the remaining one known as\r\nIndian Hannah, took up her abode in a wigwam near the Brandywine, or as\r\nshe considered it, her own lands. During the summer she traveled through\r\ndifferent parts of the county, selling willow baskets of her own\r\nproduction and visiting those who would receive her kindly.\r\n\r\nAs she grew old she quitted her wigwam and dwelt in friendly families.\r\nThough a long time domesticated with the whites, she retained her Indian\r\ncharacter to the last. She had a proud haughty spirit, hated the blacks\r\nand did not even deign to associate with the lower order of the whites.\r\n\r\nWithout a companion of her race—without kindred—she felt her situation\r\ndesolate, and often spoke of the wrongs and misfortunes of her people.\r\nShe died in the year 1803, at the age of nearly one hundred years—the\r\nlast of the Lenni Lenape resident in Chester County.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Colonel Timothy Pickering Abducted by\r\n                    Yankees at Wyoming June 26, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nThe County of Luzerne was erected from parts of Northumberland County by\r\nact of September 26, 1786.\r\n\r\nThe act of December 27, 1786, provided, “That Timothy Pickering, Zebulon\r\nButler and John Franklin notify the electors that an election would be\r\nholden to choose a Counsellor, member of the Assembly, Sheriff, Coroner,\r\nand Commissioners on the first day of February.”\r\n\r\nColonel Pickering was one of the eminent men in the Union. He had the\r\nconfidence of Washington and Congress, having executed with fidelity the\r\noffice of Quartermaster General of the Continental Army. A native of\r\nMassachusetts, after the peace he settled in Philadelphia, becoming a\r\ncitizen of Pennsylvania. He was selected, in addition to his great\r\nabilities and weight of character, for the reason that he was a New\r\nEngland man, to organize the new county and introduce the laws of the\r\nState among the Wyoming people.\r\n\r\nColonel Zebulon Butler was a hero of the French and Indian War, a\r\ncolonel in the Revolution and an honored and respected citizen among the\r\nConnecticut people in the Wyoming Valley. He was now old and desired\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nColonel John Franklin, except in education and polish, was in no respect\r\nthe inferior of Pickering. It was a wise stroke of policy to endeavor to\r\nconciliate the great Yankee leader by naming him as one of the deputies.\r\n\r\nWhen Colonel Pickering arrived at Wyoming, January, 1787, he assured the\r\nConnecticut settlers that he had strong reasons to believe the\r\nLegislature would pass a law to quiet them in their possessions. Major\r\nJohn Jenkins, a leader of the Yankees, replied they had too often\r\nexperienced the bad faith of Pennsylvania. Colonel Franklin at that\r\nmoment was consulting with the Susquehanna Company on means of defeating\r\nthe pacific measures of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nColonel Pickering was soon brought into collision with Franklin and\r\nJenkins and their followers. Franklin became so aggressive in opposing\r\nthe jurisdiction of Pennsylvania that Chief Justice McKean ordered his\r\narrest by four resolute men. A scuffle ensued, in which Colonel\r\nPickering interfered and advised them to place Colonel Franklin on a\r\nhorse, with his legs tied together, and in this condition he was carried\r\nto Philadelphia. This act, of course, exposed Colonel Pickering to the\r\nvengeful resentment of Franklin’s adherents.\r\n\r\nColonel Pickering had taken up his abode in the Wyoming Valley, near\r\nWilkes-Barre, to show the confidence he had that quiet would soon be\r\nrestored. On June 26, 1788, at the dead of night, a party of armed men,\r\nwith their faces blackened, broke into his bedroom, where he and his\r\nwife were asleep. His arms were secured with cords, and he was led off\r\nup the Susquehanna River.\r\n\r\nImmediately on the abduction of Colonel Pickering being known, vigorous\r\nmeasures were adopted for his rescue. Four companies of militia were\r\nordered out, and a thorough search for him was pursued.\r\n\r\nIt was evident from many circumstances that their object was merely to\r\nmake reprisals for Colonel Franklin’s imprisonment and to endeavor to\r\nprocure his release. No attempt was made upon Colonel Pickering’s life;\r\neven certain instances of respect were shown for his person and rank in\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nThe party crossed Lackawannock Creek and camped in the wild glens. The\r\nColonel endured much suffering, incident to a march through a wilderness\r\nand on account of heavy rains.\r\n\r\nThe fifth day of his captivity Colonel Pickering discovered that two of\r\nhis captors were Gideon and Joseph Dudley, near neighbors of his; also\r\ntwo Earle brothers, two more by the name of Kilborn, and one Cady, all\r\nneighbors.\r\n\r\nThe next day they formed an iron band, with a chain attached to it,\r\nround the Colonel’s ankle and fastened the chain to a tree. They told\r\nhim their “great men” said that is the way Colonel Franklin is held in\r\nPhiladelphia. At night the chain was fastened to one of the party, so\r\nthe Colonel could not escape without awakening him.\r\n\r\nColonel Pickering had no thought of escape, for he expected them to\r\nweary of their enterprise, as well as to come to an understanding of the\r\nseriousness of their crime. He also realized they could easily capture\r\nhim at any time they determined.\r\n\r\nDuring breakfast one of the party, who had gone for provisions, returned\r\nin great haste and told his comrades that their militia had met in\r\nbattle and Captain William Ross had been seriously wounded. This battle\r\noccurred near Black Walnut Bottom, about sixteen miles above\r\nTunkhannock.\r\n\r\nThe next day they crossed the river and went to the home of the Kilborn\r\nboys, where they kept Colonel Pickering overnight. Then they pushed back\r\ninto the woods about four miles from the river. Here the party wearied\r\nof their enterprise and began to make overtures to the Colonel,\r\nsuggesting they would liberate him if he would intercede with the\r\nSupreme Executive Council for the discharge of Colonel Franklin. The\r\nColonel would make no promises, which enraged them, and once he feared\r\nthey might tomahawk him.\r\n\r\nColonel Pickering agreed to endeavor to obtain their pardon, if they\r\nwould name their “great men,” who had deceived them in planning his\r\nabduction. This they would not do.\r\n\r\nAfter an imprisonment of nineteen days, during ten of which he had worn\r\nthe chain, and sleeping night after night in the woods, with stones for\r\npillows, living on scanty rations of salt pork, venison, corn bread and\r\nwintergreen tea, and without change of clothing, the Colonel was\r\nreleased on his own terms—which were merely that he would write a\r\npetition for them to the Executive Council, take it in person to\r\nWilkes-Barre, and send it to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nIn 1787 Colonel Pickering represented Luzerne County in the Pennsylvania\r\nconvention to ratify the Federal constitution, but did not sign the\r\nratification. At that period he was prothonotary, for that county, and\r\nwas subsequently a member of the convention called to revise the\r\nConstitution of 1776.\r\n\r\nPresident Washington appointed him Postmaster General November 7, 1791,\r\nwhich he held until January 2, 1795, when on the resignation of General\r\nKnox he was appointed Secretary of War. December 10, 1795, Washington\r\nmade him Secretary of State, which position he held until May 12, 1800.\r\n\r\nHe was poor on leaving office, and, building a log house for his family\r\nupon some wild land that he owned in Pennsylvania, he commenced clearing\r\nit for cultivation, until discovered by some friends who enabled him to\r\nreturn to Salem, Mass., in 1801. He became Judge in 1802, and United\r\nStates Senator from 1803 to 1811, when he was made a member of the\r\nCouncil. During the War of 1812 he was a member of Board of War, and\r\nthen served as a member of Congress from 1815 to 1817. He died at Salem,\r\nMass., January 29, 1829.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Ewell’s Force of Rebels Made Raid on\r\n                         Carlisle June 27, 1863\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral A. G. Jenkins, of the Southern Confederacy, with nearly 1000\r\ncavalry, entered Chambersburg June 16, 1863. On June 23 his advance\r\nforce re-entered the town when the Union troops fell back. On June 27\r\nthis advance force moved eastward toward Carlisle.\r\n\r\nGeneral Knipe, commanding the Union troops, abandoned Carlisle on the\r\napproach of the enemy, considering it a folly to offer resistance to so\r\nformidable an invader. Accordingly, the rebels were met by Colonel W. M.\r\nPenrose and Robert Allison, assistant burgess, and informed that the\r\ntown was without troops and that no resistance would be made. The\r\ncavalrymen entered the town from the west about 10 o’clock Saturday\r\nmorning, June 27, and rode their horses at a walk, but with their\r\ncarbines in position to be used at a moment’s warning.\r\n\r\nThis force consisted of nearly 500 mounted cavalry. They passed down\r\nMain Street to the junction of the Trindle Spring and Dillsburg roads,\r\nwhere some of them proceeded to the garrison and the rest rode back and\r\nhalted in the public square. The hotels were soon filled with officers\r\nand the streets with soldiers.\r\n\r\nGeneral Jenkins made a requisition on the borough authorities for 1500\r\nrations, to be furnished in one hour and to be deposited in the market\r\nhouse. The demand was complied with, but not within the specified time.\r\nSoon as the troops were refreshed and their horses fed and watered the\r\ntroopers remounted and rode through the streets of the town, visiting\r\nthe garrison and other places of interest.\r\n\r\nAt 2 o’clock in the afternoon General Ewell’s corps marched into\r\nCarlisle, Early’s division having crossed the mountains via Fayetteville\r\nto York. The soldiers moved along shouting and laughing. The Confederate\r\narmy was at this time in high spirits. The bands played “Dixie” as they\r\nswung through the town to the garrison. The condition of the troops was\r\npitiable. The men were miserably clad, many without shoes or hats, many\r\nreally ragged and dirty.\r\n\r\nA brigade encamped upon the grounds of Dickinson College, and others at\r\nthe United States garrison; guards were immediately posted and strict\r\norders issued that no violence or outrage would be permitted. Most of\r\nthe troops behaved like gentlemen, and so well did they obey their\r\ncommander that but little trace of occupation by a hostile force was\r\nvisible after their departure.\r\n\r\nGeneral Ewell and his staff, numbering thirty officers, established\r\nheadquarters at the barracks. The General then dispatched one of his\r\naides to town, with an extravagant demand on the authorities of the\r\nborough for supplies. The general wanted 1500 barrels of flour, large\r\nsupplies of medicines and several cases of amputating instruments.\r\nEspecially urgent was his demand for a large quantity of quinine and\r\nchloroform. The authorities could not have complied with the demand,\r\nbecause the articles were not to be had in Carlisle.\r\n\r\nStrict orders were issued against the selling of intoxicating drinks to\r\nsoldiers and the pillaging of private property by them.\r\n\r\nAll communication with the outside world was cut off Sunday. Services\r\nwere conducted in the churches as usual and the army chaplains of the\r\nrebel regiments encamped on the campus and at the garrison conducted\r\nservices for their troops. All conversations with Southern officers and\r\nsoldiers led the people to believe that their movement was directed\r\ntoward Harrisburg and Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, however, the railroad bridge was destroyed. A sigh of relief\r\nwas had toward evening when rumors spread that the troops had orders to\r\nleave.\r\n\r\nEarly Tuesday morning, June 30, the trains of Rode’s division began to\r\nmove, then brigade after brigade passed until the main army had\r\ndisappeared by 9 o’clock, leaving less than 200 cavalrymen on provost\r\nduty in the town. These left toward evening.\r\n\r\nRebel pickets thronged the turnpike and the Trindle Spring road, some\r\nbeing very near Carlisle. Two o’clock in the afternoon about 400\r\ncavalrymen under Colonel Cochran, entered the town from the Dillsburg\r\nroad, and were soon dashing wildly through the streets, shouting,\r\nscreaming and acting like madmen. During the night the entire\r\nConfederate force left Carlisle and the town was clear of rebels.\r\n\r\nAt sunrise on Wednesday Captain Boyd’s efficient command of Union troops\r\nentered Carlisle, and after a hearty meal he started in pursuit of the\r\ndeparting enemy. During all of this day regiment after regiment arrived\r\nand took position along the streets and in the public square. A battery\r\nof artillery arrived toward evening.\r\n\r\nAfter 6 o’clock General Smith arrived, bringing three regiments of\r\ninfantry and about one hundred cavalry. The General posted his artillery\r\nfor action. This had hardly been done, when, at 7 o’clock, a body of\r\nrebel cavalry under command of General Fitzhugh Lee, made its appearance\r\nat the junction of the Trindle Spring and Dillsburg roads. These troops\r\nat first were supposed to be a portion of our own forces. Their boldness\r\nwas well calculated to produce such an impression.\r\n\r\nThe call to arms brought the infantry into position. Members of the\r\nlocal militia companies, commanded by Captains Low, Kuhn, Black and\r\nSmiley, each on his own account, hurried to the eastern section of the\r\ntown and, selecting secure positions, opened a very effective fire on\r\nthe invading cavalry, which compelled them to fall back.\r\n\r\nSoon the shelling of the town commenced, which was kept up nearly an\r\nhour. This was followed by raking Main Street with grape and canister\r\nuntil nearly dark, when a rebel officer came in with a flag of truce to\r\nGeneral Smith’s headquarters, demanding an unconditional surrender of\r\nthe town. General Smith refused and the officer, bearing the flag of\r\ntruce, returned to his command.\r\n\r\nThen began a second shelling of the town, more terrific than the first.\r\nTo add to the general consternation the rebels applied the torch; the\r\ngas works, barracks, dwellings, stores, etc., were fired. Again an\r\nofficer interviewed General Smith and again he refused to surrender.\r\n\r\nA third bombardment commenced, which, however, did not last long. By 3\r\no’clock Thursday morning the rebel command left by way of Boiling Spring\r\nroad, thence across South Mountain for Gettysburg, to join General\r\nRobert E. Lee’s forces in the great battle which had opened there the\r\nprevious day.\r\n\r\nDuring the bombardment of Carlisle not one citizen was killed, neither\r\nwas a Union soldier, but fifteen of the latter were wounded.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               British Flag Captured by Pennsylvanians in\r\n                    Battle of Monmouth June 28, 1778\r\n\r\n\r\nJust before dawn June 18, 1778, the British began their evacuation of\r\nPhiladelphia. They crossed the Delaware, and that evening encamped\r\naround Haddonfield, N. J.\r\n\r\nThe news of this evacuation reached Washington, at Valley Forge, before\r\nmorning. He immediately sent General Maxwell, with his brigade, to\r\nco-operate with the New Jersey militia, under General Dickinson, in\r\nretarding the march of the British.\r\n\r\nThey were 17,000 strong, marching in two divisions, one under Cornwallis\r\nand the other led by Knyphausen.\r\n\r\nGeneral Arnold, whose wounds kept him from the field, entered\r\nPhiladelphia with a detachment before the rear guard of the British had\r\nleft it. The remainder of the army, under the immediate command of\r\nWashington, crossed the Delaware above Trenton and pursued.\r\n\r\nGeneral Clinton had intended to march to New Brunswick and embark his\r\narmy for New York, but, finding Washington’s army in his path, he turned\r\ntoward Monmouth Court House. Washington followed him in a parallel line,\r\nprepared to strike him whenever an opportunity should offer. But Clinton\r\nwished to avoid a battle, for he was encumbered with baggage, wagons and\r\na host of camp followers, which made his line twelve miles in length. He\r\nencamped in Freehold on the night of June 27, and there Washington\r\nresolved to strike him if he should move the next morning.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lee was in command of the advanced corps. Washington ordered him\r\nto form a plan of attack, but he failed to do so, or to forward any\r\norders to Generals Wayne, Lafayette or Maxwell, who called upon him.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of June 28, a hot Sabbath, Washington was told Clinton\r\nwas about to move, and he ordered Lee to fall upon the British rear, but\r\nhe was so tardy that the enemy had ample time to prepare for battle.\r\nWhen Lee did move he had no plan for battle, and his orders so perplexed\r\nhis generals that they requested Washington to appear on the field with\r\nthe main army immediately.\r\n\r\nWayne attacked with vigor, with a sure prospect of victory, Lee ordered\r\nhim only to make a feint. Clinton, at that moment changed front, and\r\nsent a large force against Wayne; Lafayette sensed the situation and\r\nasked Lee for permission to gain the rear of the British. At first he\r\nrefused, then ordered him to attack Clinton’s left. At the same time he\r\nweakened Wayne’s detachment by taking three regiments from it to support\r\nthe right. While Wayne was in a desperate struggle Lee’s courage\r\nweakened and he withdrew, saying that the temerity of Wayne had brought\r\nagainst him the whole flower of the British army.\r\n\r\nWashington was pressing forward to the support of Lee, when he learned\r\nthat his division was in full retreat. Washington, angered at the\r\nactions of Lee, ordered Wayne with three Pennsylvania regiments and two\r\nothers from Virginia and Maryland to stop the British pursuit.\r\n\r\nThe British, about 7000 strong, attempted to turn the American left\r\nflank, but were repulsed and disappointed. A severe battle ensued, in\r\nwhich the Americans did great execution. For a while the result seemed\r\ndoubtful, when General Wayne came up with his troops and gave victory to\r\nthe Americans.\r\n\r\nColonel Henry Monckton tried to drive Wayne from his position, leading\r\nhis troops in a bayonet charge. So terrible was Wayne’s storm of bullets\r\nthat almost every British officer was slain, Colonel Monckton being\r\namong the killed.\r\n\r\nThe battle ended at twilight, when both armies rested on their weapons,\r\nprepared for another conflict at dawn. But Clinton withdrew his army so\r\nsilently, that he was far away when the American sentinels discovered\r\nhis flight in the morning. Washington did not pursue.\r\n\r\nThe British lost 1000 by desertion while crossing New Jersey, and they\r\nleft 245 on the field. The Americans lost 228 killed, wounded and\r\nmissing.\r\n\r\nIt was during part of this action that Molly McKolly, wife of an\r\nartilleryman in Proctor’s regiment, carried water for the thirsty\r\nsoldiers, and when her husband was wounded, an officer ordered the piece\r\nto be withdrawn.\r\n\r\nMolly dropped her pitcher, seized the rammer and, displaying great\r\ncourage and presence of mind, kept the gun in action. She performed the\r\nduty with a skill and daring that attracted the attention of all who saw\r\nher. On the following morning, covered with dirt and blood, General\r\nGreene presented her to Washington, who, admiring her bravery, conferred\r\nupon her the commission of sergeant.\r\n\r\nShe was called Captain Molly, and became a heroine, always afterward\r\nknown as “Molly Pitcher.” A monument on the battlefield at Monmouth\r\nattests to her act, and her grave in the Carlisle, Pa., cemetery is\r\nmarked by a stone and cannon.\r\n\r\nJohn Blair Linn, in his Annals of Buffalo Valley, says that the flag of\r\nthe Royal Grenadiers and the sword of Colonel Monckton were captured on\r\nthe field of Monmouth by Captain William Wilson, of Northumberland\r\nCounty.\r\n\r\nThe flag is five feet four inches by four feet eight, lemon color\r\nground, heavy corded silk; the device at upper right corner is twenty\r\ninches square, British Union, consisting of the cross of St. George and\r\nSt. Andrew’s Cross. The field of the device is blue, the central stripes\r\nred, the marginal ones white.\r\n\r\nWhen Monckton waved his sword and ordered his grenadiers to charge and\r\nWayne met them with a deadly fire, the colors were in advance, to the\r\nright, with the colonel, and they went down with him. Captain Wilson and\r\nhis company, who were on the right of the First Pennsylvania, made a\r\nrush for the colors and the body of the brave colonel.\r\n\r\nCaptain Wilson gave Monckton’s sword to General Wayne, who presented it\r\nto General Lafayette, who took it with him to Europe. When he returned\r\nto the United States in 1824, he brought the sword with him, intending\r\nto restore it in person to Captain Wilson.\r\n\r\nCaptain Wilson having died in 1813, General Lafayette handed the sword\r\nto Colonel Samuel Hunter, who turned it over to Judge A. S. Wilson, a\r\nson of Captain William Wilson.\r\n\r\nThe flag has frequently been brought into requisition in patriotic\r\ndemonstrations in subsequent years. It is still in the possession of\r\ndescendants of Captain Wilson, now residents of Bellefonte.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Duke of York Receives New Patent for His\r\n                          Grant, June 29, 1674\r\n\r\n\r\nThe English claimed the right to the country upon the South, or Delaware\r\nRiver, because of the fact that John Cabot sailed up and down the\r\nAtlantic coast.\r\n\r\nCaptain Thomas Young and his nephew, Robert Evelin, under a commission\r\nfrom King Charles “to go forth and discover lands in America,” arrived\r\nin the South River July 24, 1634. They remained at the mouth of the\r\nSchuylkill five days, and made two attempts to pass beyond the falls\r\nnear Trenton. They built a fort at a place called Eriwoneck, probably\r\nthe site of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nIn 1635 the governor of Virginia sent fifteen armed men, under command\r\nof Captain George Holmes, to the South River, and they took possession\r\nof Fort Nassau and the contiguous country. The Dutch governor of New\r\nNetherland promptly sent a force which recaptured the fort and made\r\nprisoners of Holmes and his invaders.\r\n\r\nIn 1641 New Haven merchants and planters sent George Lamberton and\r\nNathaniel Turner to make land purchases on the South River. They bought\r\nfrom the Indians and built a block house, to which place about sixty\r\npersons from Connecticut settled. The venture proved profitable, and\r\nsoon other colonists arrived, and many houses were built near the mouth\r\nof the Schuylkill.\r\n\r\nThe Swedes and Dutch both protested and in May, 1642, two sloops arrived\r\nfrom Manhattan with instructions to expel the English quietly, if\r\npossible, but by force, if necessary. The Dutch were compelled to use\r\nforce, sent the English prisoners to Manhattan and burned their\r\nimprovements.\r\n\r\nCharles II having been restored to the throne of Great Britain, he\r\ngranted to his brother, James, Duke of York, later King of England, the\r\nlands lying between the Connecticut and Delaware Rivers. The duke fitted\r\nout an expedition, sailed to the mouth of the Hudson, and demanded the\r\nsurrender, which was made August 27, 1664.\r\n\r\nThis expedition then proceeded to the Delaware and November 3 forced the\r\nsurrender of that colony. Colonel Robert Carr was appointed Deputy\r\nGovernor.\r\n\r\nThis conquest caused a war between Great Britain and Holland, which\r\nended in favor of the former. The City of New Amsterdam became City of\r\nNew York; Fort Orange became Albany; the South River became Delaware\r\nRiver, and New Amstel became New Castle.\r\n\r\nColonel Richard Nicholls governed the territory with justice and good\r\nsense until August, 1668, when he was succeeded by Colonel Francis\r\nLovelace.\r\n\r\nThe first rebellion in the country was stirred up about this time, 1669,\r\nwhen Konigsmark, known as the “Long Finn,” with another Finn, named\r\nHenry Coleman, who understood the Indian language, went about preaching\r\nsedition and creating disturbances among settlers and Indians.\r\n\r\nMadame Papegoja, daughter of former Governor Printz, and Carolus Lock,\r\nthe Swedish preacher, were said to have been adherents. Konigsmark was\r\nfinally captured, put in irons, publicly whipped, branded with the\r\nletter “R” (for Rebellion), and sold into slavery in Barbados.\r\n\r\nGeorge Fox, the founder of the sect of Quakers, arrived from England and\r\nrode through New Jersey, crossed the Delaware where is now Burlington by\r\nswimming his horse. He then rode thirty miles that day and slept on some\r\nstraw in the house of a Swede. This was in 1672, and the coming of this\r\nvisitor had great significance for the future of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe Maryland Government sent a surveyor in April, 1672, to survey lands\r\nin the Delaware Colony for Lord Baltimore. In a few months a more\r\nwarlike demonstration was made, when a detail of thirty, commanded by\r\none Jones, rode into the Horekill and “bound the magistrates and\r\ninhabitants, despitefully treated them, rifled and plundered them of\r\ntheir goods,” and when it was demanded “by what authority were these\r\nproceedings,” it was answered with a “cock’t pistol to the breast of the\r\nimpudent questioner.” Jones seized all the Indian goods and skins, drove\r\na spike into the touch-hole of the great gun, and seized all the small\r\narms and mill stones.\r\n\r\nWar again broke out between Great Britain and Holland in March, 1672,\r\nand had its consequent effect on the affairs along the Delaware.\r\n\r\nIn August Governor Lovelace declared that the war included those in\r\nAmerica. The blow fell suddenly at New York, and Lovelace was taken\r\nwhile on a visit in Connecticut.\r\n\r\nA Dutch fleet appeared before New York, July 30, 1673, of such superior\r\nstrength that effective resistance was impossible. The fort capitulated\r\nand New York again became a Dutch city.\r\n\r\nThe Delaware colony made no resistance; the English were too few in\r\nnumbers, the Dutch too willing, and the Swedes too indifferent. Peter\r\nAlricks again became the commander of the Delaware River.\r\n\r\nThe renewed Dutch Government lasted only a year, when, by the treaty of\r\nWestminster, February 19, 1674, New Netherland was finally ceded to\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\nOn June 29, 1674, King Charles gave a new grant to the Duke of York, who\r\nappointed Major Edmund Andros governor.\r\n\r\nAndros set up a court at Upland in which were settled the controversies\r\nof the settlers. He reinstated in office those who had been magistrates\r\nat the time of the Dutch conquest, Peter Alricks excepted.\r\n\r\nThe administration of Andros continued quite seven years, during which\r\nthe only courts in what is now Pennsylvania were held at Upland. Nearly\r\nalways the justices were Swedes.\r\n\r\nThe settlers above Christina Creek formed what later became the\r\nPennsylvania Community. The settlers above the creek attended court at\r\nUpland, those below obtained justice at New Castle. This marked division\r\nwas made November 12, 1678, and from that date the designation “county”\r\nbecame commonly employed.\r\n\r\nSwedes’ Mill on Cobb’s Creek set up by Printz, in 1643, continued in\r\nuse, but another was now built below New Castle. Others were built\r\nafterward.\r\n\r\nAt this time there were no roads, simply paths for man or horse, and\r\ncartways where merchandise was to be transported. Such were indicated by\r\nblazed trees. November, 1678, the court ordered “that every person\r\nshould within the space of two months, as far as his land reaches, make\r\ngood and passable ways from neighbor to neighbor, with bridges where\r\nneeded, to the end that neighbors on occasion may come together.”\r\n\r\nThe time now approached when the lands along the shores of the Delaware\r\nbecame a place of refuge for all the sect of Quakers, and March 4, 1681,\r\nWilliam Penn received a patent for the lands in America, to which the\r\nKing gave the name Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Provincial Government and Indians Open\r\n                        Conference June 30, 1742\r\n\r\n\r\nIn September, 1737, occurred the so-called “Walking Purchase,” by which\r\nthere passed from the lands of the Delaware Indians into those of the\r\nProprietaries, the upper portion of Bucks County, a large slice of\r\nCarbon County, and one-fourth each of Monroe and Pike counties, an area\r\nof 1200 square miles. The “walk” upon which the purchase was made was a\r\ndeception and as a consequence caused trouble for the Proprietaries for\r\nmany years.\r\n\r\nThe lands at the “Forks” of the Delaware were still in the occupancy of\r\nthe Delaware in 1741, although the Six Nations had ordered the Delaware\r\nto remove to the Susquehanna.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1741, a Cayuga deputation returned to their county from\r\nPhiladelphia bearing with them to the “Long House” of the Six Nations a\r\nmessage from the Lieutenant Governor urging the Six Nations “to come\r\ndown and force the Delaware to quit the 'Forks’.”\r\n\r\nIn response to this appeal 230 Indians from the Six Nations, including\r\nthe principal chiefs and sachems, arrived at Philadelphia June 30, 1742,\r\nand found awaiting them a number of Pennsylvania Indians, including\r\nShikellamy, the vicegerent of the Six Nations; Allummapees, King of the\r\nDelaware, also from Shamokin, and a large delegation from the Forks of\r\nthe Susquehanna, representing the different clans. All the tribes of the\r\nSix Nations were represented except the Mohawk.\r\n\r\nIn a message to the Provincial Assembly, Governor Thomas stated the\r\ncoming of the Six Nations at this time “was not necessary for the\r\npresent peace of the province, but for the province’s future security,\r\nlikewise, in case of a rupture with the French, who will leave no\r\nmethods unessayed to corrupt the Six Nations’ fidelity and to persuade\r\nthem to turn their arms against us.” At this time declaration of war\r\nbetween England and France was daily expected.\r\n\r\nThe conference between the Governor and the Council on the one side and\r\nthe Six Nations on the other lasted until July 12, during which time\r\neight sessions were held. The Council opened in the house of James\r\nLogan, then met at “the Great Meeting House,” where the last meeting was\r\nheld in the presence of “a great number of the inhabitants of\r\nPhiladelphia.” Conrad Weiser was present as interpreter for the\r\nGovernment and the Six Nations and Cornelius Spring and Nicholas Scull\r\nappeared for the Delaware.\r\n\r\nIn opening the conference the Governor referred to the fact that the Six\r\nNations, at the time they had released their claim to all the lands on\r\nboth sides of the Susquehanna as far north as the Kittatinny Mountains,\r\nhad declined to take their pay for the lands on the west side of the\r\nriver, preferring to receive the same at some future time. He then\r\nannounced that the goods to be given in payment for those lands were\r\nready for delivery to the Indians.\r\n\r\nIn reply to the Governor, Canassatego, chief of the Onondaga and\r\nprincipal speaker of the Indians at the conference, said, among other\r\nthings: “The Six Nations have obligated themselves to sell none of the\r\nland that falls within the province of Pennsylvania to any but our\r\nBrother Onas, and that to sell lands to any other is an high breach of\r\nthe league of friendship.”\r\n\r\nThe Governor replied that they were correct in their position.\r\n\r\nOn the seventh day the Governor referred to the trouble with the “Forks”\r\nIndians, to which Canassatego replied that the deputies would take the\r\nmatter into consideration and give an answer in a few days. Three days\r\nlater Canassatego arose and said:\r\n\r\n“The other day you informed us of the misbehavior of our Cousins the\r\nDelawares, with respect to their continuing to claim and refusing to\r\nremove from some land on the Delaware notwithstanding their ancestors\r\nhad sold it by deed upwards of fifty years ago, and notwithstanding they\r\nthemselves had about five years ago ratified that deed and given a fresh\r\none. We have concluded to remove them and oblige them to go over the\r\nriver Delaware and to quit all claim to any lands on this side for the\r\nfuture, since they have received pay for them and it has gone through\r\ntheir guts long ago.”\r\n\r\nThen turning toward the Delaware and holding a belt of wampum in his\r\nhand, Canassatego continued: “Cousins—Let this belt of wampum serve to\r\nchastise you. You ought to be taken by the hair of the head and shaked\r\nseverely till you recover your senses and become sober. You don’t know\r\nwhat ground you stand on, nor what you are doing. Our Brother Onas’ case\r\nis very just and plain * * * on the other hand your cause is bad.\r\n\r\n“But how came you to take upon you to sell land at all? We conquered\r\nyou! We made women of you! You know you are women and can no more sell\r\nland than women. Nor is it fit you should have the power of selling\r\nlands, since you would abuse it.” The old chief concluded his cutting\r\narraignment as follows:\r\n\r\n“We don’t give you the liberty to think about it. You are women. Take\r\nthe advice of a wise man and remove immediately. We therefore assign you\r\ntwo places to go—either to Wyoming or Shamokin. You may go to either of\r\nthese places and then we shall have you more under our eye and shall see\r\nhow you behave. Don’t deliberate, but remove away and take this belt of\r\nwampum.”\r\n\r\nThe old chief handed them the wampum and told the Delaware that, as\r\nthere was other business to transact, they should depart from the\r\ncouncil. There was no diplomatic mincing of words in the speech of the\r\nOnondaga chief. He spoke with the air of one having authority. This\r\nspeech scattered seed which in time caused more bloodshed in peaceful\r\nPennsylvania than the “Walking Purchase” ever did.\r\n\r\nIn 1815, John Watson, of Bucks County, wrote of this speech: “When this\r\nterrible sentence was ended, it is said that the unfeeling political\r\nphilosopher (Canassatego) walked forward, and, taking strong hold of the\r\nlong hair of King Nutimus, of the Delaware, led him to the door and\r\nforcibly sent him out of the room, and stood there while all the\r\ntrembling inferiors followed him. He then walked back to his place like\r\nanother Cato, and calmly proceeded to another subject as if nothing had\r\nhappened. The poor fellows (Nutimus and his company), in great and\r\nsilent grief, went directly home, collected their families and goods,\r\nand, burning their cabins to signify they were never to return, marched\r\nreluctantly to their new homes.”\r\n\r\nLeaving their wigwams on the banks of their favorite Delaware, the once\r\npowerful Lenni Lenape commenced their march westward. A portion went to\r\nShamokin, a few settled on the Juniata, near Lewistown, but the greater\r\npart of them, under their chief Tadame, went to Wyoming.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Decisive Battle of Gettysburg Opened\r\n                        Wednesday, July 1, 1863\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Battle of Gettysburg, July 1, 2 and 3, 1863, marked the high tide of\r\nthe Civil War. Here General Robert E. Lee hoped to win a victory which\r\nwould compel the withdrawal of Union troops from other parts of the\r\ncountry, secure recognition of the Confederacy by foreign Governments,\r\ncarry panic into the North and furnish supplies for his hungry troops.\r\n\r\nFresh from his brilliant victory at Chancellorsville, he moved north\r\nuntil his van was within sight of Harrisburg, and there, learning that\r\nGeneral George G. Meade was in close pursuit, Lee turned his army to\r\nmeet him, and Gettysburg became the scene of the decisive battle.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Gettysburg was the bloodiest of the Civil War and the most\r\nterrible battle in the world’s history previous to the World’s War, and\r\nprobably greater than any single action in that gigantic conflict.\r\n\r\nThe Union losses in the three days’ battle were 23,000, and the\r\nConfederate losses were probably as high in killed, wounded, captured\r\nand missing, as 29,000.\r\n\r\nAt Gettysburg was concentrated Lee’s magnificent and confident army of\r\nConfederate troops, which had invaded Pennsylvania through the\r\nCumberland Valley, and was then on its way to Philadelphia, and then to\r\nBaltimore and Washington. The advance of Ewell’s corps marched as far as\r\nWrightsville, seventy-five miles from Philadelphia, or only four days’\r\nmarch and had watered their horses in the Susquehanna River. There the\r\nmile-long Columbia-Wrightsville bridge was burned to prevent the rebels\r\nfrom crossing the river.\r\n\r\nThe concentration of his forces at Gettysburg was forced upon General\r\nLee by the rapid movement of General Hooker with the Federal army, who\r\nhurried northward, as soon as Washington was uncovered, to intercept the\r\ninvading host, and so to loosen the grip it had upon the fair valleys,\r\nrich with ripe grain and teeming with money, horses, cattle, clothing,\r\nshoes and provisions. Curiously, the Southern army came into Gettysburg\r\nfrom the North and the Northern army came in from the South.\r\n\r\nLee’s army was in fine condition and Hooker’s was recently reorganized\r\ninto a great machine. The two armies were well matched. Each had\r\napproximately 80,000 men, including 10,000 cavalry to each; the Union\r\nhad 327 pieces of artillery, and the Southern army only forty less\r\npieces. The main difference was in commanders, for the Federal army had\r\nat Gettysburg, a new and untried commander, General Meade, who only\r\nthree days before the battle had superseded General Hooker, and had with\r\nhim two new corps commanders, Sykes and Newton, while the Confederate\r\narmy under Lee had their able and accomplished Longstreet as well as the\r\ncompetent A. P. Hill and renowned Ewell in command of their three corps.\r\n\r\nExcluding the ground of the great cavalry fight between Gregg and Stuart\r\non the afternoon of July 3, on the Rommel farm three miles east of\r\nGettysburg, where for hours these skillful generals fought for\r\npossession of the field in the immediate rear of the Union army, the\r\narea of the battlefield was about twenty square miles.\r\n\r\nLee’s intention had been to have Stuart’s cavalry strike the Union army\r\nfrom the rear the same moment Pickett was carrying the line in the\r\nfront. The first skirmish in the great battle occurred June 27, when\r\npart of Early’s command, on their way to the Susquehanna, drove the\r\nTwenty-fifth Pennsylvania Emergency Regiment out of the borough.\r\n\r\nOn June 30, Buford’s cavalrymen, reconnoitering out on the Cashtown\r\nroad, one of the seven prominent roads which converge at Gettysburg, ran\r\ninto some of Pettigrew’s infantry and in the evening of that day,\r\nColonel Gamble stationed his pickets along Marsh Creek.\r\n\r\nEarly in the following morning, July 1, Pettigrew’s Division advanced\r\ntoward the town, and at Willoughby Run, with his whole brigade\r\ndismounted, Gamble held back the Confederates for two hours. Buford had\r\nadvised General John F. Reynolds of this expected encounter; he placed\r\nthe first division of his First Army Corps upon the road, and he then\r\nhurried forward the few miles to meet General Buford.\r\n\r\nThe two rode out the Cashtown Pike, where a conference was held at 9\r\no’clock. Reynolds then hurried back to his advancing troops to spur them\r\nforward and as he was leading the foremost regiment into the woods he\r\nwas struck in the head and instantly killed. So passed away the greatest\r\nsoldier in the Army of the Potomac.\r\n\r\nAn hour later Archer’s Brigade was captured by the Federals near\r\nWilloughby Run. Then followed two hours’ lull, during which the\r\nConfederates were preparing their lines to sweep the Union troops off\r\nSeminary Ridge. General Doubleday skillfully met this attack by throwing\r\nhis two Pennsylvania brigades (of the Third Division, First Corps) into\r\nthe front line, Biddle’s on the north of the woods and Stone’s on the\r\nsouth, both in open ground; the Second Division to the woods on the road\r\ntoward Carlisle.\r\n\r\nFor three hours these fresh troops received the assaults of the enemy\r\nten times their number, and when night came it was learned that\r\nDoubleday’s Corps had been reduced from 9403 officers and men to 2400,\r\nthe 150th Pennsylvania Volunteers out of 380 men and seventeen officers\r\nbrought back eighty men and only one officer not wounded. The 121st,\r\n142d, 143d, 149th and 151st Pennsylvania all lost quite as heavily.\r\n\r\nWhile the First Corps was thus engaged, General Howard with the Eleventh\r\nCorps came down the Emmetsburg road onto the field. Three divisions were\r\nstarted for Oak Hill, that they might hold it against Ewell’s Corps,\r\ncoming back from near Harrisburg. Unfortunately the enemy had already\r\nseized the hill and Howard was forced into the open, but his two\r\ndivisions were skillfully placed, and for two hours he sustained an\r\nunequal and hopeless fight, being forced back to Cemetery Hill, just as\r\nDoubleday had been, and at about the same time.\r\n\r\nAmong the incidents of the first day’s fight was the appearance on the\r\nfield of John Burns, citizen, who came out from town dressed in a\r\nswallow tail coat with brass buttons on it, wearing a tall hat and his\r\npockets full of powder and balls and a musket which he had used in the\r\nMexican War. He approached the firing line, where Major Thomas\r\nChamberlin, of the 150th Pennsylvania Volunteers was standing, and\r\nbegged to be allowed to fight with that regiment. While discussing the\r\nmatter, he was advised to go into the woods and fight from behind a\r\ntree, which the old man did, receiving three wounds, for which\r\nPennsylvania has erected to his memory a handsome statue, located on the\r\nground where the 150th fought.\r\n\r\nOne civilian killed was Jennie Wade, eighteen years old, who was struck\r\nby a stray shot as she was baking bread in her home.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Sickles’ Corps Holds Confederates Off Both\r\n                 Round Tops at Gettysburg July 2, 1863\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the night of July 1 the two army commanders hurried up their\r\ntroops to Gettysburg, but it was on the night of July 2 before the last\r\nof Sedgwick’s Sixth Corps and the last of Longstreet’s First Corps came\r\ninto position. Meantime, at Hanover Junction, twelve miles east of\r\nGettysburg, Kilpatrick was fighting Stuart, and, having whipped him and\r\nforced the enemy cavalry around to the left and rear of the Confederate\r\nArmy, he took his position on the west of the Emmetsburg road, a mile\r\nand a half from Peach Orchard, on the left flank of the Union Army.\r\n\r\nOn July 2 General Daniel E. Sickles, with his Third Corps, came up. He\r\nwas assigned to a position on the “left of Hancock,” and occupied the\r\nEmmetsburg road as far as the Peach Orchard, throwing his left toward\r\nRound Top. He was hardly in position before Longstreet enveloped the\r\nUnion line, where, for five hours, from 3 until 8 o’clock, the battle\r\nraged furiously, the scene changing from the Peach Orchard to the\r\nWheatfield and from there to the valley between Round Top and back again\r\nto the Devil’s Den and again back to the Wheatfield.\r\n\r\nThe interposition of Sickles’ corps between the Confederate Army and\r\nRound Top was what Longstreet least desired, for he intended to make a\r\nvigorous attack upon that strategic position, but the Union forces\r\nobtained the eminence just as the enemy was ascending the western slope.\r\n\r\nIn the desperate struggle for Little Round Top four Union generals were\r\nkilled. On the Wheatfield two colonels were killed, and near the Peach\r\nOrchard General Sickles lost his leg.\r\n\r\nIn the second day’s fight Hood was wounded, but, minus a leg and an arm,\r\nhe commanded the Western Confederate Army and fought Sherman near\r\nAtlanta.\r\n\r\nThe Confederate forces had pushed the Federal line back half a mile, but\r\nhad failed to seize either Big or Little Round Top, and each side had\r\nsuffered frightfully in killed and wounded.\r\n\r\nWhen Longstreet opened his battle behind Cemetery Hill and Culp’s Hill\r\nit was expected that Ewell would attack the Union lines in front. He did\r\nnot hear Longstreet’s guns and failed to attack until 7 o’clock in the\r\nevening, when, supported by numerous guns in a hot artillery fire, the\r\nLouisiana Tigers and North Carolina brigade of Early’s division stormed\r\nEast Cemetery Hill, carrying everything before them, even to clubbing\r\nWiedrich’s artillerymen in their hastily thrown up intrenchments. But\r\nCarroll’s brigade of infantrymen was back of the guns across the\r\nBaltimore pike, and this brigade Hancock personally led against the foe,\r\nwith the result that the Union guns and positions were saved and the\r\nLouisiana Tigers as an organization went out of existence.\r\n\r\nEwell, failing to win East Cemetery Hill, at 7 o’clock pushed Johnson’s\r\ntroops against the enemy on the east side of Culp’s Hill, and, after an\r\nhour’s fighting, gained a lodgment in part of the works of the Twelfth\r\nCorps, which had been vacated by troops called to aid in defending the\r\nline on the extreme left against the attack of Longstreet.\r\n\r\nJohnson’s troops pushed their advance by 9 o’clock as far as the\r\nBaltimore road; but on account of darkness and fearful of being led into\r\na trap, did not go farther. In this contest the Confederates secured\r\nSpangler’s Spring, but all through the long night boys of both sides\r\nfilled their canteens at the gurgling fountain.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak on the morning of July 3 General Slocum, of the Twelfth\r\nCorps, made a successful attempt to drive the Confederates from the\r\nUnion breastworks they had gained the previous night, and for six hours\r\nthe woods howled with shot and shell, as this was one of the most\r\ndesperate battles. Slowly, but surely, foot by foot, the Union troops\r\nadvanced until the breastworks were wrested from the enemy, who was\r\nforced back across Rock Creek. This ended the Battle of Gettysburg, so\r\nfar as Ewell’s and Slocum’s corps of the two sides were considered.\r\n\r\nFrom 10 until 1 there was an ominous silence over the whole field in\r\nboth armies. Then came the shot and shell from 150 Confederate guns\r\nposted along Seminary Ridge, directed upon the center of the Union line,\r\nand immediately 150 guns on the Union side responded, and for nearly two\r\nhours the earth trembled.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hunt ordered the Federal pieces to cease firing to cool off,\r\nwhile he replaced disabled guns with fresh ones and replenished his\r\nsupply of ammunition for the assault which was sure to come.\r\n\r\nLee thought the Union guns were silenced from exhaustion and promptly\r\ngave orders for 15,000 of Longstreet’s and A. P. Hill’s choicest troops\r\nto force the Federal line. Pickett was in front with his 5500 men, and\r\nbravely they marched on and on when the charge commenced. From there it\r\nwas a rush, until on and beyond the stone wall, at the Angle, both sides\r\nmingled in wildest disorder, shooting and clubbing each other in a\r\nhand-to-hand struggle that seemed to have no end. One by one the\r\nConfederates threw down their arms and sought retreat.\r\n\r\nOf Pickett’s 5500 men, 224 had been killed, 1140 wounded and 1499\r\nsurrendered. Out of fifteen Confederate flags, twelve were left with the\r\nFederals, only three with the few brave troops making their way back to\r\nthe Southland.\r\n\r\nOn this third day of the battle General Hancock was carried off the\r\nfield badly wounded.\r\n\r\nWhile Pickett was making his charge, Stuart, with the Rebel cavalry,\r\nendeavored to break the Union line in the center of the rear, but there\r\nhe met General David McMurtrie Gregg, of Berks county, in command of the\r\nUnion cavalry, and was defeated in the most important cavalry battle of\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\nAll night long after the battle, Lee pushed his trains to the river\r\nthrough Fairfield Gap, and on July 4 he commenced to move his army; by\r\nthe 14th he had carried it safely across the Potomac into Virginia.\r\n\r\nGettysburg was a drawn battle, yet, strange to state, was the decisive\r\nbattle of the war and was treated by both sides and by the world as a\r\ngreat Union victory. The Gettysburg campaign was the last of several\r\nincursions upon Northern soil. Lee was afterward on the defensive.\r\n\r\nWhile all the Northern states contributed their courage and manhood,\r\nGettysburg, in its location, its leadership, and its incidents, was\r\nessentially a Pennsylvania battle.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 British and Indians Massacre Hundreds\r\n                        at Wyoming July 3, 1778\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 1778 brought great distress and fear to the frontier generally,\r\nbut particularly to Wyoming. The defeat and surrender of Burgoyne, at\r\nSaratoga, in October, 1777, had left the British without sufficient\r\navailable force in America to carry on a regular campaign for this year,\r\nand as the war was to be continued, the only resource left to the\r\nBritish commanders was to employ the Indians and Tories almost\r\nexclusively in carrying on a war of desolation on the frontier.\r\n\r\nLate in June Colonel John Butler, with his own Tory rangers, a\r\ndetachment of Sir John Johnson’s Royal Greens, and a large body of\r\nIndians, chiefly Seneca, descended the Susquehanna. This force numbered\r\nabout 400 British and Tories, and 700 Indians.\r\n\r\nAt Fort Jenkins, the uppermost in the valley, were gathered the families\r\nof John Jenkins, Hardings, Gardners and others. This fort capitulated\r\nJuly 2, to a force under Captain Caldwell. Four defenders were killed\r\nand three taken prisoners.\r\n\r\nWintermoot’s Fort was one mile below Fort Jenkins, with a view, as\r\nafterward appeared, to aiding the Tories. Soon as the enemy appeared\r\nWintermoot’s Fort at once threw open its gates, and here the British and\r\nTories assembled.\r\n\r\nThere were several stockades at Wyoming, but no other means of defense\r\nthan small arms. No one of the forts was able to hold out an hour\r\nagainst such a force as the enemy mustered. Some of the old men formed\r\nthemselves into companies to garrison these forts and yield such\r\nprotection as they could.\r\n\r\nColonel Zebulon Butler happened to be home from the Continental Army,\r\nand assumed command of the settlers. History does not record an instance\r\nof more courage displayed or more gallant devotion. There was no\r\nalternative but to fight and conquer, or die, for to retreat with their\r\nfamilies was impossible.\r\n\r\nOn July 3 they marched out to meet the enemy. Colonel Butler commanded\r\nthe right wing, aided by Major Garrett. Colonel Dennison commanded the\r\nleft, assisted by Lieutenant Colonel George Dorrance. The field of fight\r\nwas a plain only partly cleared. Opposed to Colonel Zebulon Butler, of\r\nWyoming, was Colonel John Butler, with his Tory rangers, in their green\r\nuniforms.\r\n\r\nIt was between 4 and 5 o’clock when the engagement began, but the enemy\r\noutnumbered the defenders nearly three to one, and they were soon able\r\nto outflank them, especially on the left, where was a swamp exactly\r\nsuited for savage warfare.\r\n\r\nThe Wyoming men fell rapidly, and it became impossible to maintain the\r\nposition. Colonel Dennison gave an order to fall back, so as to present\r\na better front to the enemy, but the command was mistaken as a signal\r\nfor retreat.\r\n\r\nThe fiendish enemy sprang forward, raised horrid yells, rushed in with\r\ntomahawk and spear, and slaughtered the Americans.\r\n\r\nThere are related many instances of personal and heroic bravery on part\r\nof both officers and men. They deserved a better fate, but the battle\r\nwas lost.\r\n\r\nThen followed the most dreadful massacre in the annals of\r\nPennsylvania—the most heart-rending tortures. The brave soldiers were\r\nslaughtered without mercy, principally in the flight, and after\r\nsurrendering themselves prisoners of war.\r\n\r\nPrisoners taken under solemn promise of quarter were gathered together,\r\nand placed in circles. Sixteen men were arranged around one large stone,\r\nsince known as the bloody rock. Surrounded by a body of powerful\r\nIndians, Queen Esther Montour, a fury in the form of a woman, assumed\r\nthe office of executioner, and with the death maul or tomahawk, she\r\npassed round the circle and dashed out the brains of each prisoner.\r\n\r\nThree strong men named Hammond, Lebbens and Joseph Elliott escaped by a\r\ndesperate effort. In another similar ring nine persons were slain in the\r\nsame manner. Many were shot swimming the river and hunted out and killed\r\nin their hiding places. Only sixty of those who went into the battle\r\nsurvived. The forts were filled with widows and orphans. It is said that\r\n150 widows and six orphans were the result of the battle.[3]\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  It is believed that the Indians secured 227 scalps in this battle. The\r\n  poet, Campbell, has told this dread tale in his “Gertrude of Wyoming.”\r\n\r\nAbout two-thirds of those who went out fell. Naked, panting and bloody,\r\na few who had escaped, rushed into Wilkes-Barre Fort where they told the\r\ndreadful news that all was lost. Mr. Hollenback, who swam the river amid\r\nthe shots of the enemy, was the first to spread the appalling news. They\r\nfled to the mountains and down the river. Their sufferings were\r\nterrible, and they were almost famished for want of bread. In one party\r\nof nearly a hundred there was but a single man.\r\n\r\nIn Forty Fort they heard the firing distinctly, and their spirits were\r\nhigh, until they learned the dreadful news. The first fugitives reached\r\nthe fort in the evening, and then a few others arrived during the night.\r\nColonel Dennison also came in, and rallied the little band for defense.\r\nHe succeeded the next day in entering into a capitulation for the\r\nsettlement with Colonel John Butler, by which doubtless many lives were\r\nsaved.\r\n\r\nThe enemy marched in, six abreast, the British and Tories at the\r\nnorthern gate, the Indians at the southern. On paper the terms of\r\ncapitulation were fair, but the Indians immediately began to rob and\r\nburn, plunder and destroy. Even when appealed to, Tory Butler did not\r\nput a stop to it. But the Indians did not take life within the fort,\r\nonly confined themselves to wanton plunder and insult.\r\n\r\nWhen night fell the blaze of twenty dwellings lighted up the valley. In\r\nalmost every house and field the murderous work was performed.\r\n\r\nWhen the moon rose, the terrified survivors of the massacre fled to the\r\nPoconos and beyond to Stroudsburg. In the morasses of the dreadful\r\nwilderness many women and children perished, these places are still\r\ncalled “Shades of Death.”\r\n\r\nIn a few days Colonel Butler led the chief part of his army away, but\r\nthe Indians continued in the valley burning and plundering, until nearly\r\nevery building was consumed and it was clearly shown that the articles\r\nof capitulation afforded no security.\r\n\r\nSoon after the battle Captain Spalding, with a company from Stroudsburg,\r\ntook possession of the desolate valley, and rebuilt the fort at\r\nWilkes-Barre. Colonel Thomas Hartley marched from Fort Muncy, on the\r\nWest Branch, along the Sheshequin trail up into what is now Bradford\r\nCounty, and burned the Indian villages at Wyalusing, Sheshequin and\r\nTioga, and cut off a part of the enemy who were taking a boat-load of\r\nplunder from Wyoming.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Declaration of Independence Adopted\r\n                        by Congress July 4, 1776\r\n\r\n\r\nContinental Congress was confronted with a serious situation when it\r\nconvened in the early winter of 1775.\r\n\r\nJohn Dickinson, of Pennsylvania, continued to be one of the most\r\nimportant members. He was placed on the committee to correspond with\r\nforeign Powers and was intrusted with the framing of the Articles of\r\nConfederation.\r\n\r\nThe majority of Congress were now determined to destroy the authority of\r\nthe British King, and, although Dickinson held the Pennsylvania\r\ndelegation, with the exception of Benjamin Franklin, to his own views,\r\nthe progress of events changed the public sentiment in the province.\r\nMany were to be found who, while they regretted the cruel necessity,\r\nwere now ready to give up the name Englishmen. The Assembly sensed this\r\ngrowing feeling and at length released the delegates from former\r\ninstruction and left the matter to their own judgment.\r\n\r\nA committee with John Dickinson, the author of the Farmer’s Letters, at\r\nits head, reported:\r\n\r\n“The happiness of these Colonies has during the whole course of this\r\nfatal controversy been our first wish; their reconciliation with Great\r\nBritain our next. Ardently have we prayed for the accomplishment of\r\nboth. But if we must renounce the one or the other we humbly trust in\r\nthe mercies of the Supreme Governor of the universe that we shall not\r\nstand condemned before His throne if our choice is determined by the\r\noverruling law of self-preservation which His divine wisdom has thought\r\nproper to implant in the hearts of His creatures.”\r\n\r\nCongress now resolved itself into a committee of the whole on the\r\nquestion of independence. Many of the illustrious members of Congress\r\nadvocated it with great warmth, principally John Adams, of\r\nMassachusetts; R. R. Livingstone, of New York, and Edward Rutledge, of\r\nSouth Carolina, while James Wilson, of Pennsylvania, joined with John\r\nDickinson in opposing it.\r\n\r\nWilson avowed, that notwithstanding the recall of the instructions\r\nagainst independence by the Assembly, his own sentiments remained the\r\nsame. Dickinson declared that America could be wisely governed by the\r\nKing and Parliament, not as independent, but as subject States. He\r\nbelieved the restraining power of the King and Parliament was\r\nindispensable to protect the Colonies from disunion and civil war. The\r\ndebate was adjourned until July 1, and when Congress again took up the\r\nquestion James Wilson had turned for independence.\r\n\r\nAdams led the debate in favor, and Dickinson on the side opposing it.\r\nThe time had not come for independence; he feared disunion among the\r\nColonies. He pointed out that foreign aid would not be obtained without\r\nsuccess in battle. He believed the Colonies ought at least have agreed\r\nupon the terms of their own confederation, as had been begun, and it\r\nwould have been well to have fixed the bounds of each colony.\r\nDickinson’s argument was sound and proved he had a correct grasp on\r\npublic affairs, for even after the long war for independence the\r\nColonies were divided.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania had been maintaining a border war with Virginia for the\r\npossession of the lands west of the Allegheny Mountains, and another and\r\nmore serious war with Connecticut because of the conflicting or\r\nmisunderstood boundaries.\r\n\r\nNew York had a similar dispute with Connecticut and New Hampshire, the\r\nlatter contesting the region which has since become the State of\r\nVermont. Further trouble was also to be expected as population pushed\r\ntoward the West, the older colonies claiming under their original\r\ncharters as far as the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nIn committee, when Richard Henry Lee’s resolution declaring independence\r\nwas up for vote, Dickinson, Morris, Willing and Humphreys voted against\r\nit, making a majority of the delegation from Pennsylvania, but every\r\nother colony, excepting Delaware, voted in favor of the resolution.\r\nFranklin, Wilson and Morton voted in favor of independence.\r\n\r\nAs far-seeing a man as John Dickinson was, he could not fully comprehend\r\nthe idea of a separate existence of the Colonies from the mother\r\ncountry, and yet no purer patriot breathed the air of freedom. A zealous\r\nadvocate of liberty, it was his words that startled the Colonies and\r\nstruck the keynote which aroused the energies of the provincialists and\r\nmade them contend for independence. Notwithstanding his\r\novercautiousness, the declaration having been determined on, Dickinson\r\nentered heartily into its support and took an active part in all the\r\naffairs transpiring in the Colonies—even wielding his sword in the\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nOn July 2, 1776, the resolution being reported by the Committee of the\r\nWhole, came before the House. Dickinson and Morris made no further\r\nopposition, but by absenting themselves allowed the Keystone State,\r\nwhich Pennsylvania’s population and geographical position made her, to\r\nbe put into the national arch then being erected.\r\n\r\nJohn Morton is credited with casting the decisive vote. He felt the\r\ngreat responsibility and with it odium which he incurred in the locality\r\nwhich he lived. His health broke and he died the following year. From\r\nhis deathbed he sent this protest to the friends who had turned from\r\nhim: “Tell them they will live to see the hour when they shall\r\nacknowledge my signing of the Declaration of Independence to have been\r\nthe most glorious service that I ever rendered my country.”\r\n\r\nPending the consideration of this important question of independence, a\r\ncommittee, consisting of Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin\r\nFranklin, Roger Sherman and R. R. Livingstone, was appointed to prepare\r\na Declaration of Independence. Jefferson and Adams were named a\r\nsubcommittee, and the original draft of this eloquent manifesto was made\r\nby Jefferson. It was adopted by the committee without amendment and\r\nreported to Congress on June 28.\r\n\r\nOn July 4, having received some alterations, it was sanctioned by the\r\nvote of every Colony. Of the Pennsylvania delegation, Dickinson and\r\nMorris were absent when the vote was taken; Franklin, Wilson and Morton\r\nvoted for, and Willing and Humphreys voted against it.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Massacre at Wyoming Followed by “The\r\n                     Great Runaway” on July 5, 1778\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great massacre at Wyoming occurred on July 3, 1778, and as the news\r\npassed down the North Branch of the Susquehanna and spread over the\r\nhills and valleys leading to the West Branch Valley it caused a general\r\nstampede, a wild, precipitate flight of the settlers from the upper\r\nregion which has ever since been known as the “Great Runaway.”\r\n\r\nThe history of Pennsylvania has failed to record any flight of its\r\ninhabitants, either in numbers or the harrowing details of its movement,\r\ncomparable with this catastrophe.\r\n\r\nWithin two days following the massacre the news had penetrated the\r\nentire North Branch Valley and had reached as far up the West Branch\r\nValley as Fort Antes, now Jersey Shore.\r\n\r\nOn July 9 Colonel Samuel Hunter, the county lieutenant and commandant of\r\nthe garrison at Fort Augusta (Sunbury), wrote to the Governor:\r\n\r\n“Nothing but a firm reliance upon Divine Providence and the virtue of\r\nour neighbors induces the few to stand that remain; and if they are not\r\nspeedily re-enforced they must give way; but will have this consolation,\r\nthat they have stood in defense of their liberty and country as long as\r\nthey could. In justice to this county (Northumberland) I must bear\r\ntestimony that the States never applied to it for men in vain.\r\n\r\n“I am sure the State must know that we have reduced ourselves to our\r\npresent feeble condition by our readiness to turn out upon all occasions\r\nwhen called for in defense of the common cause. Should we now fall for\r\nwant of assistance, let the neighboring counties reconcile themselves,\r\nif they can, the breach of brotherly love, charity and every other\r\nvirtue which adorns and advances the human species above the brute\r\ncreation. I will not attempt to point out the particular cruelties or\r\nbarbarities that have been practiced on our unhappy inhabitants, but\r\nassure you that for the number history affords no instance of more\r\nheathenish cruelty or savage barbarity than has been exhibited in this\r\ncounty.”\r\n\r\nColonel Matthew Smith wrote from Paxtang July 12 that he “had just\r\narrived at Harris’ Ferry and beheld the greatest scenes of distress I\r\never saw. It was crowded with people who had come down the river,\r\nleaving everything.”\r\n\r\nIf the distress was the worst this old patriot ever beheld, it was truly\r\na sad scene, for Colonel Smith had suffered in both the French and\r\nIndian and Revolutionary Wars. He was in command of a company in the\r\nArnold expedition to Quebec, when the troops for long months experienced\r\nnothing but suffering and distress.\r\n\r\nOn the same day Peter DeHaven wrote from Hummelstown: “This day there\r\nwere twenty or thirty passed through this town from Buffalo Valley\r\n(Union County) and Sunbury, and the people inform me that there are 200\r\nwagons on the road coming down.”\r\n\r\nAnother letter, written by William Maclay, later the first United States\r\nSenator from Pennsylvania, dated Paxtang, July 12: “I left Sunbury and\r\nalmost my whole property on Wednesday last. I will not trouble you with\r\na recital of the inconveniences I suffered while I brought my family by\r\nwater to this place. I never in my life saw such scenes of distress. The\r\nriver and roads leading down it were covered with men, women and\r\nchildren flying for their lives. In short, Northumberland County is\r\nbroken up.\r\n\r\n“Colonel Hunter only remained, using his utmost endeavors to rally the\r\ninhabitants to make a stand. I left him with a few—I cannot speak\r\nconfidently as to numbers—but he had not 100 men on whom he could\r\ndepend. Mrs. Hunter came down with me. As he is now disencumbered of his\r\nfamily, I am convinced he will do everything that can be expected from a\r\nbrave and determined man. Something in the way of charity ought to be\r\ndone for the miserable objects that crowd the banks of this river,\r\nespecially those who fled from Wyoming. You know I did not use to love\r\nthem, but I now sincerely pity their distress.”\r\n\r\nColonel Hunter the same day sent a most pathetic appeal to the president\r\nof the Supreme Executive Council, dated Fort Augusta, July 12:\r\n\r\n“The calamities so long dreaded and of which you have been more than\r\nonce informed must fall upon this country, if not assisted by\r\nContinental troops or the militia of the neighboring counties. At this\r\ndate the towns of Sunbury and Northumberland are the frontiers where a\r\nfew virtuous inhabitants and fugitives seem determined to stand, though\r\ndoubtful whether tomorrow’s sun shall rise on them free men, captives or\r\nin eternity.”\r\n\r\nRobert Covenhoven wrote: “I took my own family safely to Sunbury, and\r\ncame back in a keel-boat to secure my furniture. Just as I rounded a\r\npoint above Derrstown (now Lewisburg) I met the whole convoy from all\r\nthe forts above. Such a sight I never saw in all my life. Boats, canoes,\r\nhogtroughs, rafts, hastily made of dry sticks, every sort of floating\r\narticle had been put in requisition, and was crowded with women,\r\nchildren and plunder. There were several hundred people in all.\r\n\r\n“Whenever an obstruction occurred at any shoal or ripple, the women\r\nwould leap out into the water and put their shoulders to the boat or\r\nraft, and launch it again into deep water. The men of the settlement\r\ncame down in single file, on each side of the river to guard the women\r\nand children. The whole convoy arrived safely at Sunbury, leaving the\r\nentire range of farms along the West Branch to the ravages of the\r\nIndians.”\r\n\r\nSeveral persons are known to have been killed by the Indians during the\r\n“Great Runaway,” but it remains a most remarkable fact that almost the\r\nentire population moved from the settlements and for several days were\r\nin the open along the river and yet but few were killed.\r\n\r\nIn answer to the appeal from Colonel Hunter and those who really knew\r\nthe situation, Colonel Daniel Brodhead with his Eighth Regiment, then on\r\na march to Fort Pitt, was suddenly ordered to the West Branch. He\r\narrived at Fort Muncy, July 24.\r\n\r\nColonel Thomas Hartley, with a small regiment, was ordered to the\r\nSusquehanna and arrived at Fort Augusta August 1, and marched to the\r\nrelief of Colonel Brodhead at Fort Muncy, reaching there a week later.\r\n\r\nColonel Hartley was the master of the situation and using the good\r\nadvice of General Potter, Colonel John Kelly, Colonel Samuel Hunter and\r\nothers, who knew how to fight Indians, led a successful expedition\r\nagainst them, which allowed the more venturesome of the settlers to\r\nreturn to their fields and reap their harvests.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                John Conrad Beissel, Founder of Ephrata\r\n                    Society, Died There July 6, 1768\r\n\r\n\r\nThe founder of the German religious society of Seventh Day Baptists at\r\nEphrata was Reverend John Conrad Beissel, who died there July 6, 1768.\r\n\r\nBeissel was born in Eberbach, Germany, in 1690, learned the trade of a\r\nbaker, and came to America in 1720. He embraced the religious views of\r\nAlexander Mock, lived as a recluse for several years and at different\r\npoints, and finally located on the banks of the Cocalico Creek in\r\nLancaster County, February 4, 1732. Here he continued to live as a\r\nhermit and advocated the doctrine of celibacy and the seventh day of the\r\nweek as the proper day of rest and religious worship.\r\n\r\nHe was well versed in New Testament theology; possessed a commanding\r\nappearance, a fluent talker, and in most respects was well calculated to\r\ngather around him a large class of both sexes.\r\n\r\nHe was soon joined in his new home by Martin Brener, Samuel Eckerline,\r\nand another whose religious name was “Brother Jethro.” These were soon\r\nfollowed by Anna and Maria Eicher, from the Conestoga Church, two of\r\nBeissel’s former converts, who could not endure the pangs of separation\r\nfrom their spiritual teacher.\r\n\r\nThis nucleus of a church was joined in 1733 by Israel and Gabriel\r\nEckerline, and in the following year by a large number from Oley and\r\nCoventry, in Chester County, as well as a large congregation of Germans\r\nwho came from Schoharie County, N. Y., and placed themselves under the\r\nspiritual guidance of Beissel. Soon the congregation at Falkner Swamp\r\njoined them and Beissel had suddenly become the teacher of a large\r\nsettlement named Lager, meaning an encampment, but the name of which was\r\nsubsequently changed to Ephrata, by which the place is still known.\r\n\r\nPeter Miller came to America in 1730, and soon became pastor of a small\r\nReformed congregation at Tulpehocken. He was a classical scholar and a\r\ngood theologian, and after an interview with Beissel, he became one of\r\nhis apostles, casting his lot with the Brotherhood of Ephrata.\r\n\r\nWithin five years the people of this religious community had accumulated\r\na large area of landed property which was held as common stock.\r\n\r\nSoon after the founding of this society the monastic system was\r\ninaugurated, and Beissel invested with the title of father, and assumed\r\nthe name of “Friedsam,” to which was added the suffix “Gottrecht,”\r\ntogether meaning _Peaceable_, _God-right_.\r\n\r\nThe first building erected under the monastic system, in 1735, was on\r\n“Mount Zion,” and named Kedar. It contained one principal room for\r\nreligious worship, love-feasts, and the ceremony of feet-washing.\r\nBesides this there were other rooms, very small, for the use of the\r\nbrethren and sisters, those of the latter being in the upper story.\r\nAnother building larger in dimensions, and called “Zion,” was built on\r\nthe same hill in 1738. These, as well as several buildings of a later\r\nerection, were covered with shingles on the roof and outside walls, and\r\nremain thus covered to the present time.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1740 there were in the Ephrata cloisters thirty-six single\r\nbrethren and thirty-five sisters; and at one time in later years, when\r\nthe society was at the height of its prosperity, the whole congregation,\r\nincluding those living outside the principal buildings, but in the\r\nimmediate neighborhood, numbered about three hundred.\r\n\r\nThe buildings in this cloister afforded but rude and poor accommodations\r\nto the inmates. With ceilings barely seven feet in height, passages so\r\nnarrow that two persons could not pass each other in them, with very low\r\nand narrow doors, swinging on wooden hinges and fastened by wooden\r\nlatches, with cells hardly large enough to hold a cot, and each having\r\nonly the light and ventilation afforded by a single window, eighteen by\r\ntwenty-four inches in size, and containing only the most indispensable\r\narticles of furniture, and that of the rudest description, these houses\r\nwere certainly anything else than abodes of luxury for those who\r\ninhabited them.\r\n\r\nIt is stated that the brethren slept on wooden benches, with wooden\r\nblocks for pillows. Probably the dormitories of the sisters were a\r\nlittle better furnished in that particular.\r\n\r\nIn each cell was an hour-glass, and the walls were covered with German\r\ntext passages of scripture, and verses of original poetry by Beissel.\r\n\r\nThese people wore a cowl and gown of white—linen in summer, woolen in\r\nwinter. The cowl of the sisters differed but little from that of the\r\nbrethren. The difference between monk and nun could scarcely be\r\ndiscovered at a little distance. Both sexes went barefooted, except in\r\nextreme weather. They lived on food of the plainest kind, consisting\r\nalmost entirely of bread, vegetables, and mush. No animal food was on\r\ntheir tables, and even butter, cheese, and milk were discountenanced.\r\n\r\nAll their vessels for communion and ordinary drinking purposes, also\r\ntheir trays, plates and other articles for table service, and even their\r\ncandle-sticks, were of wood, and manufactured by the brethren.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of Ephrata the plow was drawn by the brethren, ranged\r\nin a long line on each side of a rope, and even the sisters often\r\nassisted in this labor. But in a short time oxen and horses were\r\nprocured to perform this work.\r\n\r\nA paper mill was built and paper manufactured for use on their own\r\nprinting presses, which had been introduced as early as 1742, the first\r\nbook being printed for Israel Eckerline in 1744. Many very fine\r\npublications came from these presses.\r\n\r\nA saw mill, a flour mill, a fulling mill, and a mill for making oil from\r\nflaxseed were put in operation. All these served the outside community\r\nand the workmen were renowned for scrupulous honesty.\r\n\r\nSinging schools were begun in 1742 and a Sabbath school was started as\r\nearly as 1740. This was the first Sabbath School in America. The\r\nbuilding for the latter was used in the fall of 1777 as a hospital for\r\nthe wounded from the Battle of Brandywine.\r\n\r\nAfter more than forty years of spiritual leadership Beissel died in\r\n1768, and Peter Miller succeeded him, but the society steadily declined,\r\nuntil the year 1875, when disputes divided them into two factions, and\r\nconsequently into legal entanglements and the effect of the community as\r\na religious enterprise became inconsequential.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Riots in Philadelphia Brought to an\r\n                          End on July 7, 1844\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween the years 1843 and 1844 a spirit of turbulence, riot and\r\ndisorder seemed prevalent throughout the United States. Philadelphia\r\nfelt the influence, which first manifested itself in 1834.\r\n\r\nOn August 12, 1834, a riot took place which was much more serious than\r\nany occurrence of that character previously known. A meeting house, near\r\nthe Wharton Market, was torn down and many colored people assaulted and\r\nbadly beaten and their houses ransacked.\r\n\r\nIn October following occurred the Robb’s Row riot, in the Moyamensing\r\ndistrict. A row of houses on Christian Street, west of Ninth, was burned\r\nby the mob and many persons injured. This disturbance was created by\r\nheated political antagonism, and was fought between rival partisans.\r\n\r\nAnother riot in which the blacks suffered, and many of their houses\r\nburned, occurred in July, 1835.\r\n\r\nOn May 17, 1838, occurred the Pennsylvania Hall riot, during which a\r\nlarge and elegant building dedicated three days before, to the purpose\r\nof public discussion by the Pennsylvania Society for the Abolition of\r\nSlavery, was broken into, set on fire and totally destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe Kensington railroad riots took place in 1840, and were a\r\nmanifestation of opposition to an attempt by the Philadelphia and\r\nTrenton Railroad Company to lay their tracks on Front Street, in the\r\nbusiness and builtup section of the city. In this disturbance the rails\r\nwere torn up, houses burned and many persons injured.\r\n\r\nAnother riot in which Negroes were the victims, took place on August 1,\r\n1842, during which Smith’s Beneficial Hall was destroyed by fire. This\r\nbuilding was erected by Stephen Smith, a prominent colored man, to be\r\nused for the meetings of the literary and beneficial societies of\r\ncolored people.\r\n\r\nThe Negro riots ceased at midnight, but on the next day the Irish\r\nlaborers in the coal yards on the Schuylkill got mixed up with a band of\r\ncolored laborers and the ensuing riot required militia to quell it.\r\n\r\nThen came the weavers’ riots in Kensington, early in 1843. This was in\r\nconsequence of disputes in regard to wages.\r\n\r\nBut the most terrible riots known in the history of Philadelphia took\r\nplace in 1844, and resulted from political and sectarian prejudices\r\nwhich were aroused into activity by the formation of the Native American\r\nParty.\r\n\r\nThe movement for the organization of this party took place early in\r\n1844. On May 6 a meeting was called, which was intended to be held on an\r\nopen lot at the southeast corner of Second and Master Streets. Before\r\nthe proceedings were concluded some difficulty arose between the persons\r\nholding the meeting and outsiders, who had gathered on the edge of the\r\ncrowd, and assumed a rather menacing attitude.\r\n\r\nSoon there was an attack made upon those in meeting and with such force\r\nthat the participants were dispersed. They soon rallied their numbers\r\nand proceeded to a market house nearby, on Washington Street above\r\nMaster. The meeting was reorganized, but the disturbances were as\r\npromptly renewed, and at this time firearms were brought into play by\r\nthe assailants.\r\n\r\nThis unfortunate affair took place in a locality where the majority of\r\nthe inhabitants were of the Roman Catholic faith, and although there was\r\nnothing to show that the latter were combined for purposes of breaking\r\nup the meeting, the feelings of the persons assailed led them to a\r\nbitter extremity. They soon obtained firearms and an attack was made on\r\nthe buildings in the neighborhood. Seven persons were killed. The Native\r\nAmericans being victors set fire to the houses attacked.\r\n\r\nOther outrages were perpetrated and other buildings burned, including a\r\nfemale seminary under charge of the sisters of a religious order.\r\n\r\nTroops were called out and quelled the rioting.\r\n\r\nThe Native Americans celebrated July 4 with a large and showy procession\r\nand ended the day’s program of festivities with a grand display of\r\nfireworks. All dispersed in good order.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of July 6 persons were discovered carrying muskets into\r\nthe church of St. Philip de Neri, on Queen Street. Crowds soon\r\nassembled, but a Sheriff’s posse promptly appeared upon the scene.\r\n\r\nAn unfortunate arrest of a member of the posse, who was kept under\r\nmilitary guard in the church through the night, caused a mob on the\r\nmorning of July 7 to assemble determined to release the prisoner. A\r\ncannon loaded with slugs was fired against the rear of the church. Then\r\nit was brought to the front, but further trouble was prevented by the\r\ncitizens and the prisoner was released.\r\n\r\nThose in the church marched out and were chased and dispersed. The city\r\nwas thoroughly excited with these proceedings and the people gathered in\r\ngreat crowds, many intent on destroying the church.\r\n\r\nA committee, many of whom were Native Americans, organized to protect\r\nthe church property and it seemed as if the trouble was at an end. But\r\nat this moment the military marched upon the scene, followed by a crowd\r\nof Sunday idlers. The soldiers attempted to clear the streets with fixed\r\nbayonets, when some one hurled a brick, striking a soldier. The captain\r\ngave orders to fire, and two volleys were sent into the crowd of men,\r\nwomen and children. Several were killed and many wounded.\r\n\r\nThe crowd now procured artillery and small arms and the most sanguinary\r\nstreet battle ensued, which continued through the night of the 7th and\r\nthe morning of July 8. Two soldiers were killed and many wounded. Seven\r\ncitizens were killed and several wounded.\r\n\r\nThe militia were withdrawn, the trouble subsided, and the most serious\r\nriot in the history of Philadelphia brought to an end.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Widow Smith’s Mill Destroyed by Indians\r\n                            on July 8, 1779\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1774 Catherine Smith, widow of Peter Smith, commenced\r\nbuilding a large grist mill near the mouth of White Deer Creek, in the\r\npresent Union County, which she completed the following year.\r\n\r\nWhen Peter Smith died in the fall of 1773, he left his widow and ten\r\nchildren with no estate to support his family, except a location for\r\nthree hundred acres of land, including the mouth of White Deer Creek,\r\nwhereon was an excellent mill seat. His widow was of the type who did\r\nnot sit idly by and let her neighbors help support her family, but\r\nrealizing that a grist and saw mill were both much wanted in that new\r\ncountry at that time, and being urged to erect these mills, she set\r\nabout the task.\r\n\r\nThe widow Smith was able to borrow some money and by June, 1775, she had\r\nboth mills in operation. They served the inhabitants in the White Deer\r\nValley and for many miles on the east side of the West Branch of the\r\nSusquehanna.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1776, there was an urgent demand for rifles for the\r\nContinental Army and for the use of the old men and boys who remained at\r\nhome to protect the women and children from the sudden attacks of the\r\nIndians, while they were doing the work about the farm and the fireside.\r\nSo Catherine Smith installed a boring mill, and the records show that a\r\ngreat number of gun barrels were bored in this mill. She also added a\r\nhemp mill.\r\n\r\nHer eldest son went to the army and this made her work the heavier, as\r\nhe was her best help. He was killed in the service.\r\n\r\nThe Indians became active following the great Wyoming massacre, July 3,\r\n1778, and after Colonel Thomas Hartley had chastised them during his\r\nsuccessful expedition in the late autumn of 1778, they again became\r\nbolder when the soldiers were withdrawn and the year 1779 was one of the\r\nmost terrible along the frontier of the Susquehanna Valleys.\r\n\r\nNearly all the inhabitants had left during the “Great Runaway,” in July,\r\n1778, and only the most venturesome had returned. The militia were\r\nrecruited locally and were under the command of Colonel John Kelly.\r\n\r\nIn May a band of nearly a score of Indians killed John Sample and wife\r\nin White Deer. Christian Van Gundy and Henry Vandyke with four others\r\nlearned of the murder and went to the scene to bring away any who\r\nsurvived the massacre. Six more men were to follow the next day.\r\n\r\nWhen Van Gundy arrived at Sample’s he had slabs put up against the door\r\nand water carried up in the loft. After dark an Indian approached the\r\nhouse, barking like a dog, and rubbing against the door, but no\r\nattention was paid to him. The party inside lay down and slept until\r\nthree o’clock, when Van Gundy got up to light a fire. The Indians\r\nsurrounded the house, and mounting a log on their shoulders, tried to\r\nbeat in the door. Those inside fired, wounding two, whom the Indians\r\ncarried off, but not before they set fire to the house.\r\n\r\nVan Gundy mounted the roof, and knocked off enough boards to reach the\r\nfire, which he extinguished. An Indian shot him in the leg and one of\r\nthe others was shot in the face.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak they voted whether to remain and fight or attempt escape.\r\n\r\nTwo voted to stay, four to go. On opening the door they discovered the\r\nIndian chief lying dead in front of it. Van Grundy secured his rifle and\r\nVandyke his powder horn.\r\n\r\nThe Indians came from ambush and the men separated. Van Grundy, with his\r\ntwo guns, took into a ravine, and tried to get the others to follow him.\r\nThey refused. The Indians killed the old people, who were scalped.\r\n\r\nColonel Kelly pursued these Indians and came upon five of them sitting\r\non a log. He placed his men and at a signal four of the Indians were\r\nkilled at one volley, the fifth escaped.\r\n\r\nThe Widow Smith’s mills were now the frontier and the only place of\r\nrefuge, except a small stockade, named Fort Meninger, which was built\r\nabout eighty rods from the river, on the north bank of White Deer Creek,\r\ncovering Widow Smith’s mills. The fort was situated west of the mills\r\nforming an apex of an irregular triangle of which the mills formed one\r\nbase, and a small stone house, the home of Widow Smith, the other. This\r\nstone house, with a modern addition, is still standing.\r\n\r\nThe fort and mills were abandoned at the time of the Great Runaway,\r\nJuly, 1778, and the fort and mills were burned by the Indians, July 8,\r\n1779. One man was killed in the attack.\r\n\r\nWidow Smith returned to the ruins in 1783, and was urged to rebuild the\r\ngrist and saw mills, which she accomplished with much difficulty.\r\nEjectments were brought against her by Messrs. Claypoole and Morris, and\r\nshe did not have the means to support actions at law and lost her\r\nimprovements.\r\n\r\nShe petitioned the Legislature, which, of course, could grant no relief\r\nunder the circumstances and her petition was dismissed. The facts set\r\nforth in her petition were certified to by William Blythe, Charles\r\nGillespie, Colonel John Kelly, General James Potter and many prominent\r\ncitizens of Northumberland County.\r\n\r\nShe is said to have walked to Philadelphia and back thirteen times in\r\nthis business.[4]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  The distance she traveled was no less than 160 miles each way.\r\n\r\nHow long the litigation continued is not a matter of record, but in\r\n1801, Seth Iredell took possession of the premises as tenant of\r\nClaypoole & Morris.\r\n\r\nShe died there and is buried in the old settlers’ graveyard. Her bones\r\nwere disturbed when a barn was erected many years later, being\r\nidentified by a venerable neighbor, by her peculiar protruding teeth.\r\n\r\nA few years after this incident a man came to the place, having traveled\r\nfrom Ohio to see the old mill site. He said he was a son of Catherine\r\nSmith, and that if justice had been done her, they would still own the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nA part of the foundation of the second mill, built by Widow Smith,\r\nserves the same purpose in a fine modern mill of today.\r\n\r\nWhen soldiers were sent into that vicinity they used the Widow Smith’s\r\nstone house. General James Potter, under date of September 18, 1780,\r\nsays: “I marched the remainder, consisting of 170 men up the West Branch\r\nto Fort Swartz. I then went to Colonel Kelly, who lay at the mouth of\r\nWhite Deer Creek, with eighty men.” This was the Widow Smith’s Mill.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  General Braddock Defeated by French\r\n                        and Indians July 9, 1755\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Edward Braddock arrived in March, 1755, at Alexandria, Virginia,\r\nand at the head of two Irish regiments, under Colonels Dunbar and\r\nHalket, marched to Fredericksburg, Maryland.\r\n\r\nThis distinguished officer was sent to command an expedition against the\r\nFrench at Fort Duquesne. He commenced his march from Wills Creek, now\r\ncalled Cumberland, Md., June 10, 1755, with 2000 men, regulars and\r\nprovincials.\r\n\r\nBraddock was haughty and egotistical and entertained no doubt of his\r\nsuccess. He advised the Governors of Pennsylvania, Maryland and\r\nVirginia, that soon as he captured Fort Duquesne he would leave there\r\nthe guns, ammunition and stores he captured in it, but if the enemy\r\nfirst destroyed the fort, he would build another.\r\n\r\nBy forced marches he reached Little Meadows June 18, when 1200 men were\r\nchosen to continue the expedition, the balance remained in camp under\r\ncommand of Colonel Dunbar. A halt of two days was made twenty-five miles\r\nfrom their objective, to await reports of the Indian scouts. That was\r\nfatal.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of July 9 the little army forded the Monongahela River\r\nand advanced in solid platoons along the southern shore of that stream.\r\nColonel Washington saw the perilous arrangement of the troops after the\r\nfashion of European tactics, and he ventured to advise Braddock to\r\ndisperse his men in open order and employ the Indian mode of fighting in\r\nthe forests.\r\n\r\nThe haughty General angrily replied: “What! a provincial colonel teach a\r\nBritish General how to fight!”\r\n\r\nThe army moved forward, recrossing the river. Meantime the French\r\ncommander Contrecœur had decided to withdraw, but Captain Beaujeu gained\r\nhis permission to resist Braddock’s passage at the second ford.\r\nBeaujeu’s command was reinforced by several hundred savages.\r\n\r\nWhen Captain Beaujeu came in sight of the English they had already\r\ncrossed the river, and had advanced so that both flanks would be exposed\r\nabout two hundred yards to an enemy occupying the deep ravines, thick\r\nwith tangled forest growth and vines.\r\n\r\nBraddock marched directly into the worst ambuscade known in American\r\nhistory. Into these ravines the Indians glided while their white\r\ncomrades blocked the English path in front and the head of the marching\r\ncolumn went down under a storm of lead. Shaken for a moment, the\r\nvanguard moved against the concentric ring and, after another terrible\r\ndischarge, returned the fire with such deadly effect that every enemy in\r\nsight was swept before it. Beaujeu and dozens of others fell victims.\r\n\r\nThe Indians turned to flee, but rallied by other French officers, they\r\nreturned to cover and under their unerring fire the English advance\r\nbroke and retreated. Mixing with the rear in the narrow path, both\r\nbecame mingled in a mob which Braddock could not restore to order.\r\nHuddled in a twelve-foot roadway, shut in by a forest alive with yells\r\nand filled with invisible fire, they lost all sense or perception, and\r\ntwice shot down bodies of their own men who had gained slight vantage\r\npoints, mistaking their smoke for that of the enemy. Fifty Virginians\r\nwere thus slain at one blow.\r\n\r\nThe regulars refused to charge, though Braddock, with four horses\r\nsuccessively shot from under him, and other officers strove to hearten\r\nthem to invade the woods. The Provincials fought Indian fashion from\r\nbehind trees and fallen logs, but Braddock with furious threats and\r\nblows drove them back again into the ranks, where they fell in scores.\r\nWashington and Halket both pleaded to have them allowed to leave the\r\nranks and fight the Indians in their own way, but Braddock still\r\nrefused.\r\n\r\nAt this point the supply of ammunition failed; the baggage train was\r\nattacked; all Braddock’s aides excepting Washington were shot down;\r\nthree-fourths of the officers and three-fifths of the entire army were\r\nkilled or wounded, and only then would the ill-judging but heroic\r\nBraddock give the signal for retreat. Shortly afterward Braddock\r\nreceived a ball through his lungs, and not one English soldier remained\r\nto carry him off the field. He was picked up by one English and two\r\nAmerican officers and carried to a spot across the river a half mile\r\ndistant.\r\n\r\nThe dying commander tried to rally his troops, by establishing a camp to\r\ncare for the wounded. Here he waited for Washington to return from\r\nDunbar’s camp, where he had been sent by Braddock. The French and\r\nIndians did not follow Braddock across the river, yet the hundred or\r\nmore English soldiers he had induced to halt there, stole away and fled.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th the officers who remained with General Braddock marched with\r\nhim until 10 o’clock at night, when they halted and met the convoy sent\r\nby Dunbar. Braddock never ceased to give calm, skillful and humane\r\norders. He reached Dunbar’s camp on the 11th, where the news of his rout\r\nhad already reached the soldiers under Dunbar, and they were fleeing in\r\nwild panic.\r\n\r\nBraddock by this time realized that any further attempt to pursue the\r\nexpedition was futile, and he must have known his wounds were fatal, for\r\nhe ordered the stores destroyed lest they fall into the enemy’s hands,\r\nsaving only sufficient for a flying march. He then proceeded with the\r\nremnant of his army toward Great Meadows, where he died and was buried\r\nin the center of the road. The entire army marched over the spot in\r\norder that the remains of the unfortunate general might not be\r\ndesecrated by the savages. In 1802, his body was reinterred at the foot\r\nof a large white oak tree.\r\n\r\nAfter the retreat of Braddock’s army, the savages, unwilling to follow\r\nthe French in pursuit, fell upon the field and preyed on the rich\r\nplunder which lay before them. Three years later (1758) by direction of\r\nGeneral Forbes, the remains of many of the slain in Braddock’s army were\r\ngathered up and buried.\r\n\r\nOf 1460 men in the battle, 456 were killed and 421 wounded; 63 of the 89\r\ncommissioned officers, and every field officer, were killed or wounded.\r\nThe enemy’s casualties were only about sixty.\r\n\r\nThe entire borders were left defenseless and this defeat was not only a\r\nfatal termination of a campaign which had been expected would inflict a\r\ndecisive blow upon the French and their Indian allies, but it gave the\r\nsignal to the disaffected Indians to make the frontiers of the Province\r\nthe scene of a predatory warfare in which every section was severely\r\nscourged.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  “Sawdust War” in Williamsport Lumber\r\n                      Regions Began July 10, 1872\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the decade from 1870 to 1880, Williamsport was the largest lumbering\r\ncenter in the United States. Everywhere Williamsport was known as “The\r\nLumber City.”\r\n\r\nIt was customary to send gangs into the woods in winter to cut down the\r\ntrees, saw them into logs and pile them on the banks of small streams\r\nand afterward, when the water was at flood height in the spring, to roll\r\nthem into the streams whence they floated down the river to\r\nWilliamsport, where they were caught in the big boom and rafted to the\r\nvarious mills to be sawed and manufactured into lumber.\r\n\r\nAfter the men were through their work in the woods it was customary to\r\nbring them to Williamsport and place them in the mills to help saw up\r\nthe logs. As the season was short and it was important to clean up the\r\nwork of sawing before the next winter, the mills operated twelve hours a\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe “sawdust war,” as it was called, was a strike on the part of the\r\nworkmen in the mills for a ten-hour day instead of twelve. There was no\r\nquestion of wages involved, and the principal advocates for the change\r\nwere men who were not employed in the lumber industry, but were simply\r\nlabor agitators.\r\n\r\nThe move for the ten-hour day began in June, 1872, and was characterized\r\nby frequent public meetings at which the speakers urged the men to go on\r\nstrike. This finally culminated in a large number of men walking out,\r\nJuly 1, 1872, and adopting as their slogan, “ten-hour day or no\r\nsawdust.”\r\n\r\nThe strike reached to Lock Haven, where the men followed the lead of\r\ntheir Williamsport fellow-workmen.\r\n\r\nMany of the mills were compelled to shut down on account of a depleted\r\nforce until July 10, when an attempt was made to start up the mills, but\r\nwithout success. This precipitated the “Sawdust War.”\r\n\r\nParades and marches were held every day, the strikers going to the\r\nseveral mills and endeavoring to induce the workers still on the job to\r\nquit. Meetings were held every night. Thomas H. Greevy, by reason of\r\nbeing secretary of the local union and secretary of the State Labor\r\nOrganization, was a prominent figure and always addressed these\r\nmeetings.\r\n\r\nAfter the strike had been in progress for a few weeks some of the men\r\nwere induced to go back to work, but others, who were not willing to\r\nreturn, interfered, when a number of breaches of the peace took place.\r\n\r\nThe marches to the mills finally resulted in assaults being made upon\r\nthe loyal workmen, and several attacks were made on mill owners on the\r\nstreets of the city. These assaults finally became so frequent and so\r\nserious that Mayor S. W. Starkweather and Samuel Van Buskirk, sheriff of\r\nthe county, called upon Governor John W. Geary for militia to be sent to\r\nWilliamsport.\r\n\r\nThis request was complied with, and on July 22 troops were ordered to\r\nthe city. They arrived the next day, July 23, and consisted of the\r\nfollowing units: City Grays, Harrisburg, Captain Thomas Maloney; City\r\nZouaves, Harrisburg, Captain Robert V. Vaughn; Middletown Zouaves,\r\nMiddletown, Captain James Stanley; Washington Zouaves, Lebanon, Captain\r\nB. Y. Hean; Coleman Guards, Lebanon, Captain J. P. S. Gobin; City Grays,\r\nWilliamsport, Captain A. H. Stead; Taylor Guards, Williamsport, Captain\r\nJohn H. White.\r\n\r\nWilliamsport was placed under martial law. On the same day, July 23,\r\nThomas H. Greevy, James M. Birmingham, A. J. Whitten, Thomas F. Blake,\r\nHenry Crook and Alem Tate were arrested on charge of inciting to riot\r\nand at a hearing on July 25, before the City Recorder, were held in\r\n$10,000 bail for their appearance at the September term of court. Bail\r\nwas promptly furnished, but an hour later Greevy was rearrested and\r\n$15,000 additional bail demanded. As other charges were pending, the men\r\nwere taken to jail to await trial. On July 27 motion was made for a writ\r\nof habeas corpus and reduction of the amount of bail, which, on July 29,\r\nwas refused by the court.\r\n\r\nSubsequent arrests were made on the same charge and all held for the\r\nnext term of court, but those above mentioned were the principals. On\r\nJuly 31 all defendants were released on bail.\r\n\r\nOn July 25 the troops on duty in the city went into camp at Herdic Park\r\nunder command of Brigadier General Jesse Merrill, of Lock Haven. On July\r\n27 the troops were reinforced by the Packer Guards, Sunbury; Sanderson\r\nGuards, Mill Hall; Langlon Fencibles, Shamokin. On July 30 five\r\ncompanies on duty were relieved and sent home. The others were relieved\r\na few days later.\r\n\r\nAt the September term of court for Lycoming County, on September 7, all\r\nthe twenty-nine defendants were brought to trial before Judge James\r\nGamble. James M. Birmingham, Thomas H. Greevy, A. J. Whitten, Thomas H.\r\nBlake, Patrick Conlin, Jacob Wolf, Timothy Shannon, Jr., Henry Crook,\r\nPatrick Dugan, Louis Plant, Michael Eustice, John Benway, William Iam,\r\nDaniel McMullen, David Deauchamp, Thomas Hackett, Joseph Ludget, James\r\nSpulong, James Sladen, John Bezel and Joseph Shear were found guilty and\r\nsentenced to jail for periods of thirty, sixty and ninety days, pay a\r\nfine of one dollar and the costs of prosecution, except James M.\r\nBirmingham, A. J. Whitten, Thomas H. Greevy and Thomas F. Blake, who,\r\nbecause they were outsiders and in no way connected with the lumber\r\nindustry, were sentenced to one year in the penitentiary and costs of\r\nthe prosecution.\r\n\r\nThey were sentenced on September 14; and on September 16 Peter Herdic\r\nwho was then one of the leading and most influential men in the State,\r\nwent to Harrisburg and induced Governor Geary to pardon them all.\r\n\r\nThe parties soon after left Williamsport, and except for two of them,\r\nall other records are lost. James M. Birmingham became a prominent\r\ncitizen of Kansas City, Mo., as did his son. Thomas H. Greevy removed to\r\nAltoona, and became a prominent citizen of the State.\r\n\r\nGreevy was engaged in journalism and edited the Labor Reform Journal of\r\nWilliamsport. He also held important offices in the local and State\r\norganizations.\r\n\r\nThe first labor convention in Pennsylvania was held at Danville, in\r\n1871, and Greevy was elected secretary, a position he held at the time\r\nof the Sawdust War. John Siney, of Schuylkill County, was State\r\npresident.\r\n\r\nAfter taking up his residence in Altoona, Mr. Greevy studied law, was\r\nadmitted to the bar and since has become one of the leading attorneys of\r\nthe State. He is a prominent adviser of the Democratic State Committee,\r\nand was a candidate for Lieutenant Governor. In every walk of life he is\r\none of the leading citizens of the country.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Moravians Visit Indian Town of Great\r\n                         Island, July 11, 1748\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat Island, situated on the West Branch of the Susquehanna River, a\r\nshort distance east of Lock Haven and opposite the mouth of Bald Eagle\r\nCreek, was a favorite camping place and council grounds for the Indians.\r\nAn Indian village was situated on this island, which is frequently\r\nmentioned in the early records of the Province.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1745 David Brainerd, a missionary stationed at Shamokin,\r\ntells in his journal of a journey which he took up the West Branch. In\r\nthis he speaks of extending his journey to Great Island and of the\r\nsufferings he endured.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1748 David Zeisberger and John Martin Mack made a\r\nmissionary trip up the West Branch for the purpose of visiting the\r\nIndians, who were undergoing terrible hardships as a result of a famine.\r\nOn July 11, 1748, two days after their start from Shamokin, we find the\r\nfollowing entry in Mack’s journal:\r\n\r\n“July 11. Toward evening reached Great Island and found Indians at home\r\nresiding on this side of the island. They asked us whence we came and\r\nwhether we had ought to sell. When told that we were not traders, but\r\nhad only come to visit them, it was incomprehensible to them. But a few\r\nold squaws were living on the island; the men had been driven away by\r\nfamine. We consequently remained on this side of the island and asked an\r\nIndian whether we could lodge in his hut. He took us in cordially and\r\nspread a bear skin for us to sleep on, but he had nothing for us to eat.\r\nAscertained that he was a Five Nation Indian and his wife a Shawnese.\r\nWhereupon Brother Zeisberger conversed with him. His father, who is\r\nupward of seventy years, was dying of smallpox and was a most pitiful\r\nobject. His care and that of the Indians here enlisted our sympathies\r\nand silent prayers.\r\n\r\n“In the evening we were visited by a number of Indians—Shawnese and\r\nCayugas. Here dwell in three houses Shawnese, Maquas and Delaware; among\r\nthe latter an Indian from Albany, who spoke Low Dutch. In all three\r\nhouses were cases of smallpox. In one hut hung a kettle in which grass\r\nwas being stewed, which they ate with avidity.\r\n\r\n“July 12. Brother Zeisberger learned from our host that many Indians\r\npassed and repassed his hut. Today he brought out some dried venison and\r\ngave us some, and we in turn gave his child some of our bread, for which\r\nthey were very thankful.\r\n\r\n“In the afternoon told our host we desired to visit the island to see\r\nthe Indians there, and he, unasked, went with us, and led us to all the\r\nhuts.\r\n\r\n“We found some clever people here who had just returned from the woods\r\nand who shared with us grapes, green and hard, which they ate with\r\navidity. We prayed silently to the Lord to have mercy on this people.\r\n\r\n“Returned to our lodgings, and our host again asked us why we had come\r\nso far and had we not come in search of land? He said there was fine\r\nland in the neighborhood. We explained that was not our object.\r\n\r\n“July 13. We found an opportunity to speak to our host of the Saviour.\r\nHe had heard somewhat of God, and said he believed what we had told him\r\nwas good and true. He then gave us some dried venison and we in turn\r\nsome needles and thread to his wife.\r\n\r\n“Set out on our return down the Susquehanna. At night camped on a large\r\nflat by a creek, ate some mouldy bread, the last of our stock and built\r\nfour fires to keep off the vermin.”\r\n\r\nIn the year 1758 Christian Frederic Post, another Moravian missionary,\r\nwas sent by the Government of Pennsylvania to the Delaware, Shawnee and\r\nMingo Indians settled on the Ohio. In his journal under the date of July\r\n29 we find the following entry:\r\n\r\n“29th. We crossed the Susquehanna over the Big Island. My companions\r\nwere now very fearful and this night went a great way out of the road,\r\nto sleep without fire, but could not sleep on account of the mosquitoes\r\nand vermin.”\r\n\r\nOn his return from his mission under the date of September 18, he\r\nrecords:\r\n\r\n“Came to the Big Island, where having nothing to live on, we were\r\nobliged to stay and hunt.\r\n\r\n“19th. We met twenty warriors, who were returning from the habitations\r\nwith five prisoners and one scalp; six of them were Delaware and the\r\nrest Mingo. We sat down all in one ring together. I informed them where\r\nI had been and what was done; they asked me to go back a little and so I\r\ndid, and slept all night with them. I informed them of the particulars\r\nof the peace proposed; they said if they had known so much before they\r\nwould not have gone to war. They killed two deer and gave us one.”\r\n\r\nPost’s mission had been undertaken with the object of making peace with\r\nthe Indians, for, following Braddock’s disastrous campaign against Fort\r\nDuquesne, the Indians had attacked the settlements, and the entire West\r\nBranch Valley as far down as Sunbury was in complete control of the\r\nFrench and their Indian allies.\r\n\r\nIn 1755 Andrew Montour, who had been employed on various occasions as\r\ninterpreter for the province, and who at this time was captain of a\r\ncompany of Indians in the English service, following an attack upon\r\nsettlers on Penn’s Creek, in which a number of the settlers were killed,\r\nwas summoned to the Great Island by the friendly Delaware living there.\r\nHere he was informed that the French had made overtures to the Indians\r\nto go on the war path against the English settlers in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nIn November these Indians also sent word that two messengers had come\r\nfrom Ohio to Great Island; and seeing an Englishman who happened to be\r\nthere at the time, said “Kill him.” “No,” said the Indians of the Great\r\nIsland, “we will not kill him nor suffer him to be killed. We have lived\r\nin peace many years with the English; if you are so bloodthirsty go\r\nsomewhere else for blood. We will have no blood spilt here.”\r\n\r\nAt this period as well as at the time of Post’s mission, three years\r\nlater, Great Island was being visited by both French and English in\r\ntheir desires to secure the Indians as their allies. It was at this\r\nperiod also that the Governor of the Province of Pennsylvania issued a\r\nproclamation which encouraged the whites to scalp the Indians by the\r\noffer of a bounty for every Indian scalp brought in.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Riots in Philadelphia Caused by Boy\r\n                    Assaulting Master, July 12, 1835\r\n\r\n\r\nFeelings of animosity against people of color had been manifested in\r\nPhiladelphia for several years, and were again brought forth\r\nconspicuously through a most unfortunate circumstance July 12, 1835.\r\n\r\nRobert E. Stewart, a prominent citizen of Philadelphia, who had been\r\nUnited States Consul to Trinidad, resided on the east side of Sixth\r\nStreet, between Prune and Walnut.\r\n\r\nHe had in his service an African boy, called Juan, who was a native of\r\nthe Eboe nation, the representatives of which bore the character of\r\nbeing vindictive, revengeful and easily moved to anger. Juan had been\r\nbrought to the United States from the West Indies by Mr. Stewart.\r\n\r\nFor some reason not known Juan determined to take the life of his\r\nmaster. The attack was made upon Mr. Stewart while he was sleeping in\r\nthe afternoon in his chamber. The butt end of a hatchet was used in a\r\nshocking manner upon his head. He was frightfully mutilated and injured,\r\nand it was supposed that he could never recover. He died several years\r\nafterward.\r\n\r\nThe brutal attack upon Stewart was made July 12. A statement of the\r\ncircumstances in the newspapers of the next day created intense\r\nexcitement, and soon as the story was read crowds began to assemble, and\r\nby evening a large crowd had gathered in the neighborhood of Sixth and\r\nLocust Streets.\r\n\r\nBy this time the city authorities had learned something from the events\r\nof former years, when the racial hatred had caused many fatal clashes,\r\nand a large body of watchmen and police were dispatched to that section\r\nof the city.\r\n\r\nCrowds began to join those already in that neighborhood, and they were\r\nmade up of men and half-grown boys, usually in an angry mood. The\r\ncitizens soon dispersed about the neighborhood, talking together, in\r\nsmall groups.\r\n\r\nThe presence of the police rendered any outburst impossible so they\r\ncarried their destructive propensities into an adjoining district, and\r\nthere commenced an attack upon houses occupied by colored people in\r\nSmall Street between Sixth and Seventh. The inmates were beaten and put\r\nto flight, and their furniture destroyed.\r\n\r\nFrom that place their ravages were resumed upon the colored residents in\r\nSeventh and Shippen Streets. Thence the destruction was transferred to\r\n“Red Row”—a block of eight houses on Eighth Street below Shippen.\r\n\r\nThe mob here made a discrimination. All the young colored men who could\r\nbe found were brutally assaulted, because the colored youth were\r\ngenerally saucy and impudent, but the old men and women of color were\r\nnot molested or in any manner injured.\r\n\r\nDuring the proceedings “Red Row” was set on fire and all the houses\r\ndestroyed. The mob had now become so infuriated that they were\r\nunrestrained even by the presence of police, and from the burning homes\r\nin “Red Row” they proceeded to Christian and Ninth Streets, where\r\nseveral brick and frame houses occupied by colored people were attacked.\r\n\r\nSeveral of those houses were defended by the owners, and others who had\r\nsought refuge in them. Several shots were fired from behind doors and\r\nwindows, and two persons in the mob were wounded. By the time the houses\r\nwere finally entered the residents had escaped.\r\n\r\nThe houses in flames in “Red Row” had brought the firemen to the scene,\r\nbut when they set up their apparatus, they were opposed by the mob. The\r\nhose was cut and no water could be brought into play. The firemen,\r\nhowever, fought their way and succeeded in saving from total destruction\r\nall the houses, except the one in which the fire was started. The mob\r\nbecame even more determined and attacked houses which had been passed by\r\nat the beginning of the attack.\r\n\r\nBy these occurrences the colored people in the lower part of the city\r\nwere frightened to a degree of terror which had not affected them in\r\nprevious years.\r\n\r\nOn the day after this riot hundreds of families moved out of the\r\nneighborhood, or, locking up their houses, sought refuge where they\r\ncould find it. Numbers of men, women and children bivouacked in the\r\nwoods and fields, and not a few fugitives were given shelter in barns\r\nand outbuildings.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday evening, July 14, crowds again began to assemble in the\r\nvicinity of Sixth and South Streets, on the rumor that a house on St.\r\nMary Street was garrisoned by armed Negroes.\r\n\r\nThe mob proceeded to this house and upon their arrival found that the\r\nstatement was true. Fifty or sixty colored men were in the building,\r\narmed with knives, razors, bludgeons and pistols, besides a great stock\r\nof bricks and paving stones, which were stored on the third floor, where\r\nthey could be hurled with effect upon an attacking party. These men were\r\ndesperate and were rendered savage by the occurrences of the two\r\nprevious days.\r\n\r\nThe city police force was promptly upon the scene and prepared to\r\nprevent the assault intended to be made by the whites upon the house.\r\nThe police, at the same time, had the difficult task of getting the\r\ncolored men away from the building in safety. This they were able to do.\r\n\r\nWith this attack frustrated, the trouble was finally quieted and there\r\nwere no further racial disturbances.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Hannastown, Seat of Justice for Westmoreland\r\n                       County, Burned by Indians\r\n                             July 13, 1782\r\n\r\n\r\nThe county of Westmoreland was established by the Provincial Assembly,\r\nFebruary 26, 1773, and the courts directed to be held at Hannastown.\r\nThis was the first place west of the Allegheny Mountains where justice\r\nwas dispensed according to the legal forms by the white man.\r\n\r\nHannastown contained about thirty habitations and a few crude cabins.\r\nMost of the former were two stories high and built of hewn logs. There\r\nwas also a wooden court house, a jail and a stockade, both built of\r\nlogs.\r\n\r\nRobert Hanna, the first presiding Judge, was a member of the family from\r\nwhom the town derived its name. Arthur St. Clair, afterward the\r\ndistinguished general in the Continental Army, was the first\r\nprothonotary and clerk of the courts.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of July 13, 1782, a party of townsfolk went to O'Connor’s\r\nfields, about a mile north of the village, to cut wheat. The reapers had\r\ncompleted one field when one of their number reported that he had seen a\r\nnumber of Indians approaching. Every one rushed for town, each intent\r\nupon his own safety, each seeking his own wife and children, to hurry\r\nthem into the stockade.\r\n\r\nAfter a period of frightful suspense, it was agreed that some one should\r\nreconnoiter and relieve the balance from uncertainty. David Shaw, James\r\nBrison and two other young men, armed with rifles, started on foot\r\nthrough the highlands between the fort and Crabtree Creek, pursuing a\r\ndirect course toward O'Conner’s fields.\r\n\r\nAn officer who had been on duty in the town pursued a more circuitous\r\nroute on horseback, and no sooner arrived at the fields than he beheld\r\nthe whole force of the savages there assembled. He turned his horse to\r\nescape, but was followed. He met the four others who were on foot and\r\nwarned them to fly for their lives.\r\n\r\nThe four young men were hotly pursued by the Indians, who did not fire\r\nupon them, for they expected to take the inhabitants by a surprise\r\nattack. Shaw rushed into the town to learn if his kindred had gone into\r\nthe fort. As he reached his father’s threshold he saw all within\r\ndesolate and, as he turned, discovered the savages rushing toward him\r\nwith their brandished tomahawks, and yelling the fearful warwhoop. He\r\ncounted upon making one give the death halloo, and raising his rifle,\r\nthe bullet sped true, for the savage at whom he aimed bounded in the air\r\nand fell dead. Shaw then darted for the fort, which he reached in\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nThe Indians were exasperated when they found the village deserted,\r\npillaged the houses and then set them on fire.\r\n\r\nAn Indian who had donned a military coat of one of the inhabitants and\r\nparaded himself in the open was shot down. Except this one and the\r\nIndian killed by Shaw, it is not believed any others were killed.\r\n\r\nOnly fourteen or fifteen rifles were in the fort, and but few of the men\r\nof military experience, as a company had been recruited there but a\r\nshort time before and marched away with Lochry’s ill-fated campaign,\r\nleaving not more than a score of men in the village. A maiden, Janet\r\nShaw, and a child were killed in the fort.\r\n\r\nSoon after the Indians had set fire to the buildings of the village some\r\nof them were observed to break away from the main body and go towards\r\nMiller’s Station.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there had been a wedding at that place the day before and\r\nmany guests were still at the scene of the festivities. Among them was\r\nJohn Brownlee, known along the frontier for his courage in scouting\r\nagainst the savage marauder. The bridal party was in the midst of their\r\nhappy games, when, like a lightning flash, came the dreaded warwhoop.\r\n\r\nThose in the cabins and the men in the fields made their escape. In the\r\nhouse, where all was merriment, the scene was instantly changed by the\r\ncries of women and children mingled with the yell of the savage. Few\r\nescaped.\r\n\r\nAmong those who got away are two incidents of intense interest. A man\r\nwas carrying his child and assisting his aged mother in the flight, the\r\nsavages were gaining on them, the son and father put down and abandoned\r\nthe child, the better to assist his mother. The next morning the father\r\nreturned to his cabin and found his little innocent curled up in his\r\nbed, sound asleep, the only human thing left amidst the desolation.\r\n\r\nThe other incident occurred when a powerful young man grasped a child,\r\nwho stood near him and made his escape, reaching a rye field and taking\r\nadvantage of some large bushes, he mounted a fence and leaped far into\r\nthe tall rye, where he lay down with the child. He heard the quick tread\r\nof the savages as they rushed by and their slower steps as they\r\nreturned, voicing their disappointment.\r\n\r\nThe wedding party were made prisoners, including the bride and groom,\r\nand several of the Miller family.\r\n\r\nWhen the Indians were all assembled and the prisoners secured, the\r\nlatter were loaded with plunder and the march commenced. They had\r\nproceeded less than a mile when one of the Indians recognized Brownlee\r\nand communicated it to the others. As he stooped to readjust the child\r\non his back, who he carried in addition to the luggage they had put on\r\nhim, an Indian buried a tomahawk in his head. When he fell the child was\r\nkilled by the same Indian.\r\n\r\nOne woman screamed at the sight of this butchery and the same tomahawk\r\nended her agony. These bodies were found next day and decently buried.\r\n\r\nAt nightfall thirty men assembled and determined to give succor to those\r\nin the fort. They armed themselves and hastened with great caution,\r\nknowing that if the Indians intended to attack the fort at dawn that\r\nthey had retired to the low land at Crabtree Creek.\r\n\r\nFifty rifles were too few to attack 300 Indians and sixty white savages,\r\nso they put in action strategy which won. They mounted all the horses\r\nthey had and trotted back and forth across a bridge of plank, near the\r\nstockade, two drums and a fife completed the deception that\r\nre-enforcements were arriving in great numbers. The ruse had the desired\r\neffect. The cowardly Indians, fearing the retribution they deserved,\r\nstealthily fled during the night.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners were surrendered by the Indians to the British and taken\r\nto Canada. After the peace eighty-three prisoners who survived were\r\nfreed and returned to their homes.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                George Ross, Lawyer, Iron Manufacturer,\r\n                 Soldier, Statesman, Patriot, Signer of\r\n                      Declaration of Independence,\r\n                           Died July 14, 1779\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Philadelphia Packet, July 15, 1779, contained this item:\r\n\r\n“Yesterday died at his seat near this city, the Honorable George Ross,\r\nJudge of Admiralty of this State.” He was interred in the churchyard of\r\nChrist’s Church, Philadelphia, the day following his death. The Supreme\r\nExecutive Council attended the obsequies in a body.\r\n\r\nGeorge Ross, the son of Reverend George Ross, minister of the\r\nEstablished Church, and Catherine Van Gezel Ross, was born in New\r\nCastle, Lower Counties, May 10, 1730. He was of excellent Scotch stock,\r\nhis family traced their descent from the Earls of Ross.\r\n\r\nGeorge received an excellent education, with special instruction in the\r\nclassics; studied law in Philadelphia, with his half brother, John, and\r\nwas admitted to the bar at Lancaster in 1750. He rose rapidly in his\r\nprofession, and was interested in the manufacture of iron, which he\r\ncontinued to the time of his death.\r\n\r\nSoon after settling at Lancaster, in 1751, he married Miss Anne Lawlor.\r\n\r\nHe was made prosecutor for the Crown and took a deep interest in the\r\nwelfare of the growing town of Lancaster, which was soon recognized by\r\nhis neighbors and he was elected to the Assembly of Pennsylvania in\r\n1768. From this time on his short life of forty-nine years was crowded\r\nwith civic and patriotic duties; while the State and Federal Governments\r\nhonored him with many positions of trust.\r\n\r\nHe immediately became a leader in the Assembly where he was a most\r\npronounced Whig. By successive elections he was continued in that body\r\nuntil 1774, when he was a member of the Provincial Conference and then a\r\nmember of the first Continental Congress.\r\n\r\nGeorge Ross was one of a committee to whom was referred the patriotic\r\ncommunication of the House of Burgesses of Virginia, recommending a\r\nCongress of the colonies for the purpose of resisting British arbitrary\r\nenactments, and in Congress he consistently furthered those measures\r\nwhich finally led to American Independence.\r\n\r\nIn 1775, Governor John Penn having written a message disapproving any\r\nprotective measures on the part of the colonies, Mr. Ross drew up a\r\nstrong and convincing reply.\r\n\r\nHe was a true friend of the Indians, and served as one of the\r\nCommissioners to Fort Pitt in 1776.\r\n\r\nMr. Ross was made a member of the Committee of Safety for Pennsylvania;\r\nvice president of the Constitutional Convention of 1776; colonel of the\r\nFirst Battalion of Associators for Lancaster County; and as a fitting\r\nclimax, he signed the Declaration of Independence.\r\n\r\nDuring his service as a member of the Continental Congress he was named\r\non the committee with General George Washington and Robert Morris to\r\nprepare a design for a new flag. It was through his suggestion that the\r\ncommittee called on his niece, Betsy Ross, and with her help the\r\nbeautiful flag of the United States was designed and adopted.\r\n\r\nIll health forced Colonel Ross to resign from Congress and on leaving\r\noffice the citizens of Lancaster voted him a piece of silver to cost\r\n£150, which he declined to receive.\r\n\r\nAfter varied and valuable labors in the service of the colonies and of\r\nPennsylvania he was appointed a judge of the Court of Admiralty, as a\r\nminute of the Supreme Executive Council for March 1, 1779, records the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n“Resolved, That the Honorable George Ross, Esquire, be commissioned\r\nJudge of the Admiralty of this State, under the Act of Assembly; that\r\nthis Board highly approve the firmness and ability he has hitherto shown\r\nin the discharge of his said office.”\r\n\r\nDuring his incumbency, which lasted but a brief period, he was regarded\r\nas learned and prompt, a happy combination.\r\n\r\nJudge Ross probably knew the standing of every merchant in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nHis house in Lancaster stood on the site of the present Court House, and\r\nhis country home was a farm in what was then a suburb of Lancaster, now\r\na part of the city, called in his honor, Rossmere.\r\n\r\nHe was interested in several iron furnaces, the most important of which\r\nwas the Mary Ann furnace of York County. This was the first blast\r\nfurnace west of the Susquehanna. His partners were George Stephenson,\r\none of the first lawyers in York County, and William Thompson, the\r\nlatter’s brother-in-law, later distinguished as a general in the\r\nRevolution. George Ross also owned Spring Forge III, also in York\r\nCounty, and he was a partner with George Taylor, of Easton, another\r\nsigner of the Declaration of Independence, in a furnace in New Jersey\r\ncalled Bloomsbury Forge.\r\n\r\nHis half brother John Ross, was also much interested in the iron\r\nbusiness, and seems to have been a rather picturesque character. He was\r\nan officer of the King, and Graydon says of him: “Mr. John Ross, who\r\nloved ease and Madeira much better than liberty and strife, declared for\r\nneutrality, saying, that let who would be king, he well knew that he\r\nwould be a subject.”\r\n\r\nHis health seems to have been poor for some time before his death as a\r\nletter from Edward Burd to Jasper Yeates, July 16, 1779, says:\r\n\r\n“Poor Mr. Ross is gone at last. I was one of his Carriers. He said he\r\nwas going to a cooler climate, and behaved in the same cheerful way at\r\nhis exit as he did all thro the different trying scenes of life.”\r\n\r\nHe was a Churchman by inheritance, and was vestryman and warden of St.\r\nJames’ Church, Lancaster, contributing liberally to its varied\r\ninterests. Genial, kind and considerate, his sense of humor evidently\r\nlightened the cares of his strenuous life.\r\n\r\nA memorial pillar was erected in 1897, on the site of his house in\r\nLancaster.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Provincial Convention Ends Proprietary\r\n                        Government July 15, 1776\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the debate in the Continental Congress upon the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, the old Provincial Government of Pennsylvania received\r\nsuch a mortal blow, that it soon expired without a sigh, ending forever\r\nthe proprietary and royal authority in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Committee of Correspondence for Philadelphia issued\r\na circular to all the county committees calling for a conference in that\r\ncity on June 18, 1776. This conference unanimously resolved “that the\r\npresent Government of this Province is not competent to the exigencies\r\nof our affairs, and that it is necessary that a Provincial Convention be\r\ncalled by this Conference for the express purpose of forming a new\r\nGovernment in this Province on the authority of the people only.”\r\n\r\nThe delegates to this convention to frame a constitution for the\r\nproposed new Government consisted of the representative men of the\r\nProvince. It is only natural that in time of excitement the men chosen\r\nfor such important duty should be those most active in the military\r\norganizations, or local committeemen, men whose ability, patriotism and\r\npersonal popularity was unquestioned. It was to be expected that the old\r\nstatesmen would be crowded out unless they were leaders in the\r\nrevolutionary movement.\r\n\r\nAs such they met in Philadelphia, July 15, each taking without hesitancy\r\nthe prescribed test oath and then organized by the selection of Benjamin\r\nFranklin, president; George Ross, of Lancaster, vice president, and John\r\nMorris and Jacob Garrigues, secretaries.\r\n\r\nOn July 18, Owen Biddle, Colonel John Bull, the Reverend William\r\nVanhorn, John Jacobs, Colonel George Ross, Colonel James Smith, Jonathan\r\nHoge, Colonel Jacob Morgan, Colonel Jacob Stroud, Colonel Thomas Smith\r\nand Robert Martin were appointed members of a committee to “make an\r\nessay for a declaration of rights for this State.”\r\n\r\nOn July 24 the same persons were directed to draw up an essay for a\r\nframe or system of Government, and John Lesher was appointed in place of\r\nColonel Morgan, who was absent with leave.\r\n\r\nThe same day the convention established a Council of Safety to exercise\r\nauthority of the Government until the new Constitution went into effect.\r\nAt the head of the Council was Thomas Wharton, Jr.\r\n\r\nDuring the convention the delegates not only discussed and perfected the\r\nmeasures for the adoption of a Constitution, but assumed the supreme\r\nauthority of the State, and legislated upon matters foreign to the\r\nobject for which it was convened. Not only did it form the Council of\r\nSafety, but it approved of the Declaration of Independence, recently\r\nadopted by the Continental Congress, and also it appointed justices of\r\nthe peace, who were required, before assuming their functions, to each\r\ntake an oath of renunciation from the authority of King George III, and\r\none of allegiance to the State of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nJuly 25, Colonel Timothy Matlack, James Cannon, Colonel James Potter,\r\nDavid Rittenhouse, Robert Whitehall and Colonel Bertram Galbraith were\r\nadded to the Committee on the Frame of Government.\r\n\r\nThe convention completed its labors on September 28, by adopting the\r\nfirst State Constitution, which went into immediate effect, without a\r\nvote of the people.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution as finally adopted vested all legislative power in the\r\nGeneral Assembly of the Representatives of the freemen to be composed\r\nfor three years of six persons annually chosen from the City of\r\nPhiladelphia and six from each county of the State including\r\nPhiladelphia, outside the city, afterwards the representation to be\r\napportioned every seven years to the number of taxable inhabitants.\r\n\r\nLaws, except in sudden necessity, were not to be passed until the next\r\nsession after proposal. The executive power was vested in a Supreme\r\nExecutive Council of twelve elected members, one from the City of\r\nPhiladelphia, and one from each of the counties, including Philadelphia,\r\nso chosen that one-third would retire each year and no member, after\r\nserving three years, should be eligible within four years.\r\n\r\nA president and vice president were to be annually chosen from this\r\nbody, by the joint ballot of the Councillors and Assemblymen. New\r\ncounties were each to have a councillor. The president and the Council,\r\nfive of whom constituted a quorum, were to appoint all Judges, the\r\nAttorney General, etc.\r\n\r\nThe right to vote was given to all freemen over twenty-one years of age\r\nwho had resided within the State a year before the election and paid\r\ntaxes, but the sons, twenty-one years old, of Freeholders were not\r\nrequired to pay taxes. The freemen and their sons should be trained and\r\narmed for defense of the State under regulations and with exceptions\r\naccording to law, but with the right to choose their own colonels and\r\nofficers under that rank.\r\n\r\nA debtor, except for fraud, should not be kept in prison, after giving\r\nup his real and personal estate for the benefit of his creditors. A\r\nforeigner having taken the oath of allegiance could purchase and\r\ntransfer real estate and after a year’s residence have all the rights of\r\na natural-born subject, but be ineligible as a member of Assembly until\r\nafter two years’ residence.\r\n\r\nA Council of Censors of two members chosen from each city and county\r\nevery seven years beginning with 1783 should inquire into the violation\r\nof the Constitution and whether the legislative and executive branches\r\nof the Government had exercised greater powers than they were entitled\r\nto, and could impeach or, by a two-thirds vote of those elected, call a\r\nconvention to amend the Constitution.\r\n\r\nArticles to be amended were to be published six months before election,\r\nin order that the people might have opportunity of instructing their\r\ndelegates concerning them.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Gibson’s Lambs Start on Expedition for\r\n                         Powder, July 16, 1776\r\n\r\n\r\nPowder has always been an essential product in every epoch of the\r\nstirring history of our country. The situation was always serious, but\r\non the western side of the Allegheny Mountains there were many times\r\nwhen the settlers were in desperate situation on account of little or no\r\npowder.\r\n\r\nIn times of peace the powder used in these western counties was\r\npurchased with furs, and every farmer had a quantity in his home for\r\nboth hunting and defense, but when the Revolution broke out the demand\r\nwas greater than the supply, and the Indian hostilities stopped the fur\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nCompanies of rangers were organized and a patrol maintained along the\r\nAllegheny and Ohio Rivers, so that the Indian marauders could be\r\ndetected and pursued. The work of the frontiersmen was of no use without\r\ngunpowder, and in their desperation these hardy pioneers planned an\r\nexploit to New Orleans, where they could purchase a quantity from the\r\nSpanish Government.\r\n\r\nThe band of volunteers was under the leadership of Captain George Gibson\r\nand Lieutenant William Linn. The former, the son of a Lancaster tavern\r\nkeeper, was a trapper and had gone to Pittsburgh with his brother John,\r\nwhere they engaged in the fur trade. In his youth he had made several\r\nvoyages at sea and nearly all his life had traveled through the Indian\r\ncountry. William Linn was from Maryland, a farmer and skilled hunter. He\r\nhad fought under Braddock and had been used as a scout along the\r\nMonongahela River.\r\n\r\nCaptain Gibson selected fifteen of the hardiest and bravest of his\r\ncommand. These came to be known as Gibson’s Lambs, on account of their\r\nfearlessness. Flatboats were built in Pittsburgh and the expedition\r\nstarted from that place Tuesday, July 16, 1776. A trip down the Ohio was\r\nextremely dangerous, as all along the river and especially the lower\r\npart, the Indians kept a constant watch.\r\n\r\nThe “Lambs” left behind them every evidence that they were soldiers.\r\nThey retained rifles, tomahawks and knives, but were clad in coarse\r\nclothes resembling boatmen or traders. So clever was their disguise that\r\neven when in Pittsburgh their errand remained a secret. The impression\r\nwas that they were venturing on a trading trip. The expedition\r\nsuccessfully passed the British posts at Natchez and reached New Orleans\r\nin safety after five weeks on the water.\r\n\r\nLouisiana was then a Spanish province, under the governorship of Don\r\nLuis de Ungaza, to whom Captain Gibson bore letters of commendation and\r\ncredit, as well as to Oliver Pollock and other American merchants, then\r\nresident in New Orleans. Pollock was a wealthy Philadelphian and\r\nexercised great influence with the Spanish authorities. He assisted in\r\nnegotiating for the powder. Spain was at peace with Great Britain, but\r\nwilling to give secret aid to the Americans.\r\n\r\nThe British agents in New Orleans soon learned of the arrival of the\r\nGibson party and, sensing their mission, made complaint to the Spanish\r\nauthorities that rebels against the British Government were in the city.\r\n\r\nCaptain Gibson was arrested and lodged in a Spanish prison, where he was\r\ntreated with the greatest consideration. While he was confined, Oliver\r\nPollock obtained the powder and secreted it in his warehouse. The\r\npurchase amounted to 12,000 pounds and cost $1800.\r\n\r\nThe powder was divided into two portions. Three thousand pounds of it\r\nwas packed in boxes, falsely marked as merchandise of various kinds, and\r\nquietly conveyed to a sailing vessel bound for Philadelphia by way of\r\nthe gulf and ocean.\r\n\r\nThere was a coincidence in the fact that on the very night the ship\r\nsailed Captain Gibson “escaped” from prison, got on board the vessel and\r\naccompanied the precious powder to its destination.\r\n\r\nThe balance of the powder was turned over to Lieutenant Linn, as this\r\nwas to be used on the Western frontier. This was in half casks, each\r\ncontaining about sixty pounds. These were smuggled during the night to\r\nthe barges which were tied up in a secluded place above the city.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Linn hired a score of extra boatmen, mostly Americans, and on\r\nSeptember 22, 1776, the little flotilla made a fine getaway without\r\ndiscovery and began its long journey up the Mississippi. The work was\r\nhard and the trip took seven months.\r\n\r\nAt the falls of the Ohio it was necessary to unload the cargoes and\r\ncarry the heavy casks to the head of the rapids, when the barges were\r\ndragged over the shallow stream and reladen. Several times the\r\nexpedition was forced to tie up by ice and many hardships were\r\nexperienced before the return of the spring weather.\r\n\r\nMay 2, 1777, the expedition reached the little settlement of Wheeling,\r\nwhere Fort Henry had been erected. There Lieutenant Linn turned over his\r\nprecious cargo to David Shepherd, county lieutenant of the newly erected\r\nOhio County, Virginia.\r\n\r\nLinn’s responsibility ended at Wheeling. County Lieutenant Shepherd sent\r\nthe powder to Fort Pitt, under heavy guard, where it was turned over to\r\nColonel William Crawford and safely stored in the brick magazine of the\r\nfort. The safe arrival of this powder was the cause of great rejoicing\r\nand nothing was too good for Lieutenant Linn and the fearless “Lambs.”\r\n\r\nVirginia paid for the powder, but it was turned over for “the use of the\r\ncontinent.” Portions were distributed to the frontier rangers and to the\r\ntwo regiments then being mustered in Southern Pennsylvania for\r\ncontinental service. It was from this powder that Colonel George Rogers\r\nClark drew his supply, in the spring of 1778, for his famous and\r\nsuccessful expedition to the Illinois country.\r\n\r\nGeorge Gibson was promoted to rank of lieutenant colonel in the Virginia\r\nservice and Lieutenant Linn was made a captain and placed in command of\r\nthe “Lambs.” To each of these officers the Virginia Legislature made a\r\ngrant of money in addition to their regular pay.\r\n\r\nBoth these brave men performed other acts of heroism during the\r\nRevolution and both were killed by the Indians. Linn made a settlement\r\nten miles from Louisville. While riding alone, March 5, 1781, on his way\r\nto attend court, he was surprised by a small party of Indians in the\r\nforest. Next morning his mutilated body was found, with his horse\r\nstanding guard over it. Colonel Gibson was mortally wounded at St.\r\nClair’s defeat in Northwestern Ohio, November 4, 1791.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             Virginia Sends Captain John Neville to Command\r\n                        Fort Pitt, July 17, 1775\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the original charter of Virginia the northern boundary of that colony\r\nwas supposed to be at the end of the fortieth degree, which was as far\r\nnorth as Philadelphia. This charter was dissolved in 1624, and instead\r\nof narrowing the limits of Virginia it apparently increased them.\r\n\r\nVirginia became a royal province without any definite boundaries, and\r\nshe considered herself as a keeper or trustee for the King of England of\r\nall contiguous territory not lawfully granted to another colony.\r\n\r\nThe Maryland grant to Lord Baltimore was taken out of the domain of\r\nVirginia, and she acquiesced in it. But west of Maryland she insisted\r\nthat her ownership extended for an indefinite distance northward and\r\nwestward, and she had made it good by occupation as far north as\r\nPittsburgh.\r\n\r\nThis was certainly a broad claim of title, and the only remnant of it\r\nnow is that curious narrow strip of land, called the Pan-Handle, which\r\nextends northward between Pennsylvania and Ohio for some distance above\r\nthe fortieth degree.\r\n\r\nThe Indian trade at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela had\r\nalways been an object of Virginia’s desire. In 1752 Virginia determined\r\nto erect a fort there, and Pennsylvania was willing because the fort\r\nwould stop the advance of the French, their common enemy, but she\r\nreminded Virginia that the land belonged to the Penns.\r\n\r\nThe French, in 1754, had seated themselves at Logstown, and the Governor\r\nof Virginia began to construct a fort on the site of Pittsburgh, but the\r\nFrench surprised the little garrison, captured the works, finished it,\r\nand named it Fort Duquesne.\r\n\r\nThe French held the fort until English forces, under General John\r\nForbes, invested it November 25, 1758. It was abandoned in 1771.\r\n\r\nSome time prior to 1756 Virginia erected the District of West Augusta,\r\ncovering the territory of Pennsylvania west of the Laurel Hills and\r\nsouth of the Ohio and Allegheny Rivers, and in that year divided it into\r\nthree counties, viz: Monongalia, Yohogania and Ohio.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania also erected upon this disputed territory Bedford County,\r\nin 1771, and Westmoreland County, in 1773 Penn’s Manor of Pittsburgh,\r\ntoo, was surveyed for the proprietaries early in 1769, and in the\r\nbeginning of 1771 magistrates were appointed by Pennsylvania and for\r\nsome time discharged the duties of their offices without having their\r\nauthority questioned.\r\n\r\nThe new Governor of Virginia was John, Earl of Dunmore, or Lord Dunmore,\r\nof whom Bancroft says: “No royal governor ever showed more rapacity in\r\nthe use of royal power.” He at once determined on seizing control of the\r\n“Forks of the Ohio,” for Virginia and for himself. He appointed Dr. John\r\nConnolly, a man of much energy and talent, but without principle, to be\r\n“captain commandant of Pittsburgh and its dependencies.”\r\n\r\nConnolly arrived in Pittsburgh late in December, 1773, and early in\r\nJanuary, 1774, took possession of the dismantled fort, which he renamed,\r\ncalling it “Fort Dunmore,” required and commanded the people to assemble\r\nthemselves there as a militia.\r\n\r\nHe mustered the militia under Virginia law, intimidated the Pennsylvania\r\nmagistrates, marched some of them off to prison and established the\r\nauthority of Virginia throughout all the region between the Monongahela\r\nand the Ohio.\r\n\r\nWhile a large part of the inhabitants of that region were Virginians by\r\nbirth and predilection, there were some fearless and loyal Pennsylvania\r\nadherents who did all in their power to resist Connolly’s high-handed\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\nOne of these, Arthur St. Clair (afterward General St. Clair), then\r\nprothonotary of the new county of Westmoreland, issued a warrant against\r\nConnolly and had him committed to jail at Hannastown, from which he was\r\nsoon released on giving bail for court appearance there.\r\n\r\nConnolly returned to Virginia, was sworn in as a Justice of the Peace\r\nfor Augusta County, and when court met at Hannastown, he appeared with\r\nhis militia, armed and with colors flying, and refused to admit the\r\nPennsylvania magistrates. He arrested three of the magistrates and sent\r\nthem to Staunton, where they were confined in jail.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, Simon Girty led a mob to Hannastown, stormed the jail and\r\nreleased such prisoners as were Virginia partisans.\r\n\r\nThe Tory conduct of Connolly at Pittsburgh became so bold and obnoxious\r\nthat in June, 1775, he was seized by twenty men, under orders of Captain\r\nSt. Clair, and carried to Ligonier, with the intention of delivering him\r\nto the Continental Government at Philadelphia. He was released, however,\r\nand fled from Pittsburgh by night and made his way to Portsmouth,\r\nVirginia, where he joined Lord Dunmore on a man-of-war, taking refuge in\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nVirginia had revolted from Dunmore’s tyranny at home, but showed no\r\ndisposition to repudiate his aggressions in Pennsylvania nor the\r\nmachinations of Connolly.\r\n\r\nThe boundary dispute was maintained, although, in view of the troubles\r\nwith the mother country fast approaching, the Virginia and Pennsylvania\r\ndelegates in Congress, including such men as Thomas Jefferson, Patrick\r\nHenry and Benjamin Franklin, had united in a circular urging the people\r\nin the disturbed region to mutual forbearance.\r\n\r\nThis action of Congress and the constant fear of an Indian uprising\r\npersuaded the Virginia Provincial Convention, in session at\r\nWilliamsburg, July 17, 1775, to pass a resolution which sent Captain\r\nJohn Neville with one hundred men from the Shenandoah Valley to take\r\npossession of Fort Pitt.\r\n\r\nThe following year the Virginia counties in the disputed territory were\r\norganized with their loyal and administrative machinery, but the rancor\r\nof the contest had, however, somewhat diminished and there were no such\r\nacts of violence committed as during the regime of Connolly and his\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nCaptain John Neville continued to command until the Continental Congress\r\ndetermined to take Fort Pitt under its care and provide a garrison at\r\nthe continental expense. The offer was accepted by Virginia and General\r\nWashington selected Brigadier General Edward Hand to relieve Captain\r\nNeville of his command.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Susquehanna Company Organized in\r\n                       Connecticut, July 18, 1753\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly charters granted to Massachusetts, Connecticut, Virginia and the\r\nCarolinas made the Pacific Ocean the nominal western boundary of those\r\ncolonies. Prior occupancy by the Dutch and the settlement of the\r\nboundaries had created an exception in favor of New York and New Jersey,\r\nbut all the country west of the Delaware River within the same parallel\r\nof latitude with Connecticut was still claimed by that colony as part of\r\nher domain.\r\n\r\nThe southern boundary was to be a straight line beginning at the mouth\r\nof Narragansett Bay. The line extended west would have entered\r\nPennsylvania near Stroudsburg and crossed the North Branch of the\r\nSusquehanna at Bloomsburg, the West Branch at Milton, and passing\r\nthrough Clearfield and Newcastle would cut the State nearly through the\r\nmiddle. Penn’s charter fixed the northern boundary of his province at\r\nthe forty-second degree of latitude. A large strip of territory was thus\r\ngranted to both Connecticut and Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nOn July 18, 1753, about 250 men, mostly from Connecticut, met at\r\nWindham, that State, and organized “The Susquehanna Company.” Then, with\r\nthe consent of the Connecticut Assembly, application was made to the\r\nCrown for leave to plant a new colony west of the Delaware. It was\r\ngranted, and the company sent agents to the Indian treaty at Albany,\r\nJune, 1754, who succeeded in obtaining from representatives of the Six\r\nNations the cession of a tract of land on the northern branch of the\r\nSusquehanna River, where eleven years before King Tedyuskung and his\r\ntribe had built the town of Wyoming.\r\n\r\nThe Proprietaries of Pennsylvania protested against this purchase, and\r\nclaimed that this land was within the limits of their charter. They also\r\nclaimed that the purchase had not been made in open council, but had\r\nbeen effected after making the Indians drunk.\r\n\r\nAs this council at Albany had been called to form a union of the\r\nColonies with the Six Nations as their allies against the French, the\r\npurchase was not then seriously opposed. Besides, Pennsylvania bought a\r\nlarge tract of land from the Six Nations at the same treaty, and in a\r\nway not satisfactory to the Indians.\r\n\r\nThe French and Indian War prevented any attempt at settlement of the\r\nWyoming Valley until 1762, when about 200 colonists and their families\r\nentered the valley and commenced building and planting near the site of\r\nthe present Wilkes-Barre. Before winter set in, extensive fields of\r\nwheat had been sown upon lands covered with forest trees in August. But\r\nowing to the scantiness of provisions, the settlers returned to\r\nConnecticut for the winter.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time another Connecticut association, called the\r\n“Delaware Company,” had begun a settlement on the Delaware River.\r\nProclamations were issued and writs of ejectment were placed in the\r\nhands of the Sheriff of Northampton County.\r\n\r\nEarly in the month of May, 1763, the settlers returned, accompanied by\r\nmany others. Notwithstanding the remonstrances of Northampton County, to\r\nwhich the Wyoming Valley then belonged, settlements were made at\r\nWilkes-Barre, Kingston, Plymouth and Hanover.\r\n\r\nSeveral hundred acres were improved with corn and other grain, and a\r\nlarge quantity of hay cut and gathered, and everything was moving\r\nforward in a prosperous and happy manner when, without the least\r\nwarning, on October 15, the settlers were attacked while dispersed and\r\nengaged in their work, and about twenty of them slain.\r\n\r\nMen, women and children fled to the mountains, from which they saw their\r\nhomes plundered and burned and their cattle taken away. They abandoned\r\ntheir settlement and made their way back to Connecticut or to Orange\r\nCounty, New York. This is known in the history of Pennsylvania as the\r\nfirst massacre of Wyoming. It was the work of the Delaware Indians, led\r\nby Captain Bull, son of King Tedyuskung.\r\n\r\nSome believe the Iroquois convinced the Delaware that the white settlers\r\nhad murdered Tedyuskung and that this massacre was committed in\r\nretribution.\r\n\r\nFor six years after this assault no settlement was attempted. The\r\nIndians, anticipating revenge for the massacre, left the valley.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Penn family made every effort to prove that the title\r\ngiven to the Susquehanna Company was not complete and that their charter\r\nwas valid. Finally some chiefs, assisted by Sir William Johnson, openly\r\ndisclaimed the sale to the Susquehanna Company. Then the Six Nations\r\nassembled in council at Fort Stanwix and on November 5, 1768, gave a\r\ndeed of the disputed lands to the Penns.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Pennsylvanians took possession of the Wyoming Valley and built\r\na fortified trading house there. They laid out two manors, one on each\r\nside of the river, and extending over the farms abandoned by the New\r\nEnglanders.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1769, the Susquehanna Company sent forty men into the\r\nvalley, to be followed shortly by 200 more. They were given land and 200\r\npounds Connecticut currency to provide themselves with farming tools and\r\nweapons, on condition that they would stay in the valley and defend it\r\nagainst Pennsylvania. They built a blockhouse called, from their\r\nnumbers, Forty Fort. Their leader was Colonel Zebulon Butler, a hero of\r\nthe French and Indian War, a brave partisan commander.\r\n\r\nA civil war prevailed for some years known as the “Pennamite and Yankee\r\nWar.” Forts were constructed and many sieges and skirmishes followed.\r\nBoth parties led men to prison, drove women and children away and\r\ncommitted other outrages.\r\n\r\nThe Connecticut men were generally successful in this strife. They\r\norganized a separate State, but could not maintain it. So in 1774 they\r\nattached themselves to Connecticut, as the town of Westmoreland, in the\r\nCounty of Litchfield.\r\n\r\nDuring the Revolution there was a lull in the strife in Wyoming.\r\nHowever, as soon as the war ended the old feud broke out in all its\r\nformer fury.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania having, in 1779, succeeded the heirs of William Penn, now\r\nappealed to Congress to settle the dispute. A commission met at Trenton\r\nin 1782 and, after five weeks of deliberation, decided that Connecticut\r\nhad no right to the land, and that the jurisdiction of the same belonged\r\nto Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Tom Quick, the Indian Killer and Picturesque\r\n                     Character, Born July 19, 1734\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in the year 1733 a Hollander, named Thomas Quick, came to the\r\ncolony of New York, a few months later located on the Delaware River, on\r\nwhat afterward became known as Upper Smithfield, near where Milford,\r\nPike County, now stands. He appears to have been the pioneer settler on\r\nthe Pennsylvania side; here he cleared lands, erected a log cabin and\r\nbarns, and raised wheat and maize. A son was born July 19, 1734, named\r\nThomas, and he was familiarly known in after years as Tom Quick, the\r\nIndian killer.\r\n\r\nHe was the pet of the household, and even the Indians who roamed over\r\nthat region frequently visited Quick’s place and much admired the fine\r\nlooking, stout lad, and often made him presents of plumes, feathers,\r\nskins and other articles.\r\n\r\nTom grew up among these Indians, learned their language, and was taught\r\nby them how to hunt wild animals, and fish after the manner of the\r\nIndians. He grew fond of the Indian life, and became such an expert\r\nhunter, trapper and fisherman, that his father could never induce him to\r\nfollow any other occupation. He even refused to attend school with his\r\nsisters, and in fact became almost an Indian by nature.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Thomas Quick, Sr., had become the prosperous owner of a\r\ngrist and saw mill on a small stream entering the Delaware near Milford,\r\ncalled the Vandemark. But Tom, Jr., never became an employe, but did\r\nlearn much of the beautiful Minisink Valley, with its high cliffs on the\r\nPennsylvania side and receding hills on the New Jersey side, as it\r\nextends from Port Jervis to the Delaware Water Gap. The romantic water\r\nfalls and rocky glens were his hunting and fishing grounds. This\r\nknowledge afterward served his purpose in waylaying and murdering\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nThe Delaware Indians viewed with alarm the steady encroachments of the\r\nwhites, and many had already taken up arms against the English. The\r\nQuick family, however, had always lived on friendly terms with them, but\r\nthe Indians were not unmindful of the fact that this sturdy Hollander\r\nhad been the very first to push that far into their favorite hunting\r\ngrounds.\r\n\r\nThe prospect of plundering an opulent man like Quick overcame any\r\nfeelings of gratitude that might linger in the savage breast.\r\n\r\nWhen the French and Indian War commenced, the Quicks were uneasy and\r\ntheir alarm increased as the Indians grew less sociable, and finally\r\nwithdrew altogether from the Delaware River.\r\n\r\nQuiet reigned until the Quicks became careless and one day the father\r\ncrossed the river to grind grist, accompanied by Tom and his\r\nbrother-in-law, all unarmed. As they rounded a point near the river they\r\nwere fired upon from ambush, and the old man fell mortally wounded.\r\n\r\nThe young men endeavored to carry him across the frozen river but as\r\nthey stepped on the ice they were fired on and Tom was hit in the foot.\r\nThey soon got out of danger, but not before they saw the savages take\r\nTom Quick’s scalp.\r\n\r\nYoung Tom was frantic with rage and grief, and that moment swore that he\r\nwould never make peace with the Indians as long as one remained upon the\r\nbanks of the river.\r\n\r\nFrom this time forth the demon of unrelenting savage hatred entered\r\nTom’s heart and he became more like the savages he pursued than like a\r\ncivilized man. He never entered the army but took Indians at all times,\r\nwhether in peace or war, and without regard to age or sex.\r\n\r\nHe seems to have operated about the close of the Indian War, at a time\r\nwhen they began to again visit their former haunts, supposing they would\r\nbe well received.\r\n\r\nAmong the Indians who returned was a drunken vagabond named Muskwink,\r\none who had assisted in murdering Tom’s father.\r\n\r\nTom met Muskwink at Decker’s Tavern, on the Neversink, where he had\r\nbecome very bold and abusive, claiming Tom’s acquaintance and desiring\r\nhim to drink with him. Tom refused and cursed him, which caused a heated\r\nexchange of words, during which Muskwink boasted of the part he played\r\nin the murder of Tom Quick, Sr. He bragged that he scalped him with his\r\nown hands, and at the same time mimicked the grimaces of the dying man,\r\nto corroborate his assertion, exhibited the sleeve buttons worn by his\r\nvictim at the time.\r\n\r\nTom seized a musket, which was hanging in the bar room, and ordered\r\nMuskwink to leave the place. He arose slowly and departed, pursued by\r\nTom until they had gone about a mile, when Tom overtook the savage and\r\nshot him dead. Tom returned to the tavern, gave up the musket, drank a\r\nglass of rum, and left the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nHis next exploit was when he espied an Indian family in a canoe near\r\nButler’s Rift. Tom concealed himself in the tall grass and as the canoe\r\nglided nearer he recognized the Indian as one who had committed many\r\noutrages on the frontier.\r\n\r\nOnly a few words were exchanged when Quick shot the man and tomahawked\r\nthe woman and three children. He sank the bodies and destroyed the\r\ncanoe, and did not tell of this crime for years, when he was asked why\r\nhe killed the children. He replied, “Nits make lice.”\r\n\r\nThere are many stories told of Tom Quick, which have been preserved by\r\ntradition and which are firmly believed by descendants of the older\r\nfamilies of Pike County.\r\n\r\nOne story is told in which several Indians caught him splitting rails\r\nand told him to go along with them. Tom asked them to assist him split\r\nopen the last log and as they put their fingers in the crack to help\r\npull it apart Tom knocked out the wedge and caught them all. He then\r\nkilled each one at his leisure.\r\n\r\nHe went on a hunting trip with an Indian and they killed seven deer. He\r\ntook the meat but gave the Indian the skins. He threw them across his\r\nshoulder, Tom fell behind and shot the Indian and took the skins as well\r\nas the meat, saying he had shot a buck with seven skins.\r\n\r\nHe was hunting with another Indian and pushed him off of the high rocks.\r\n\r\nTradition says that on his death bed he claimed to have killed\r\nninety-nine Indians, and that he begged them to bring an old Indian, who\r\nlived near, in order that he might bring his record to an even hundred.\r\n\r\nIn his old age he was regarded as a hero by the pioneer hunters and\r\ntrappers. He died at James Rosencrantz’s in 1795, and was buried on his\r\nfarm.\r\n\r\nThe time has long since passed when such a revengeful murderer can be\r\nexalted to the rank of a hero, yet Tom Quick, the Indian slayer,\r\nweather-beaten, and with wornout accoutrements and costume in keeping,\r\npresented a picturesque and Rip Van Winkle-like appearance that would\r\nhave formed no bad subject for an artist’s pencil.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              William Maclay, First United States Senator,\r\n                     Born in Chester, July 20, 1737\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Maclay, son of Charles and Eleanor Query Maclay, was born July\r\n20, 1737, in New Garden Township, Chester County, Pa. He attended the\r\nclassical school of the Reverend John Blair, in Chester County. He\r\nstudied law and was admitted to practice at the York County bar in 1760.\r\nDuring the French and Indian War he served as a lieutenant in Colonel\r\nHugh Mercer’s battalion, and distinguished himself during General Forbes\r\nexpedition in 1758. In 1763 he participated at the Battle of Bushy Run,\r\nand during the subsequent progress of Colonel Bouquet’s campaign was\r\nstationed in command of a company at one of the stockades on the route\r\nof the expedition.\r\n\r\nOn account of this service he never practiced his profession. Much of\r\nhis time was taken up in surveying lands allotted to officers, but at a\r\nlater period Governor John Penn was instrumental in having him admitted\r\nto the Cumberland County bar, and for a short time he acted as\r\nProthonotary.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the French and Indian War he visited England and had an\r\ninterview with Thomas Penn, one of the Proprietaries, relative to\r\nsurveys in parts of the Province, and on his return became an assistant\r\nof Surveyor General Lukens on the frontier.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1769, he married Mary McClure Harris, daughter of John Harris,\r\nthe founder of Harrisburg.\r\n\r\nOn the organization of Northumberland County March 21, 1772, he was\r\nappointed Prothonotary and Clerk of the Courts.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1772, he laid out the town of Sunbury and erected for himself a\r\nfine stone house, which, with modern improvements, is still standing.[5]\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  For many years the residence of Hon. Simon P. Wolverton, and now that\r\n  of his widow.\r\n\r\nAt the outset of the Revolution, although an officer of the Proprietary\r\nGovernment, William Maclay took a prominent and active part in favor of\r\nindependence, not only assisting in equipping and forwarding troops to\r\nthe Continental Army, but marched with the associators which\r\nparticipated in the Battles of Trenton and Princeton. He held the\r\nposition of assistant commissary of purchases.\r\n\r\nDuring the “Great Runaway,” following the Wyoming massacre, July 3,\r\n1778, William Maclay fled with his family from Sunbury to Harris’ Ferry,\r\nand in a letter to the president of the Executive Council he gave a very\r\ngraphic picture of the distress. Again after the attack and destruction\r\nof Fort Freeland by the British, Tories and Indians, July 28, 1779,\r\nMaclay again wrote to the seat of government in which he described the\r\nforlorn situation of the frontiers. In a later letter he deplored the\r\nremoval of soldiers from the West Branch Valley, where the Indians had\r\ncommitted such terrible depredations.\r\n\r\nIn 1781 he was elected to the Assembly, and from that time forward he\r\nfilled the various offices of member of the Supreme Executive Council,\r\nJudge of the Court of Common Pleas, deputy surveyor, etc. After the\r\nRevolution he made a visit to England in the interest of the Penn\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1789, he was elected to the United States Senate, taking his\r\nseat there as the first Senator from Pennsylvania. He drew the short\r\nterm, and his position terminated March 3, 1791, his colleague, Robert\r\nMorris, securing the long term.\r\n\r\nMaclay’s election to this body raised him upon a higher plane of\r\npolitical activity, but contact with the Federal chiefs of the young\r\nRepublic only strengthened his political convictions, which, formed by\r\nlong intercourse with the people of Central Pennsylvania, were intensely\r\ndemocratic.\r\n\r\nMaclay differed with the opinions of President Washington; he did not\r\napprove of the state and ceremony attendant upon the intercourse of the\r\nPresident with Congress, he flatly objected to the presence of the\r\nPresident in the Senate while business was being transacted, and in that\r\nchamber boldly spoke against his policy in the immediate presence of\r\nPresident Washington.\r\n\r\nMaclay was the original promoter and later the actual founder of the\r\nDemocratic Party. Long before Thomas Jefferson’s return from Europe,\r\nWilliam Maclay assumed an independent position, and in his short career\r\nof only two years in the Senate propounded ideas and gathered about him\r\nelements to form the opposition which developed with the meeting of\r\nCongress at Philadelphia, October 24, 1791, in a division of the people\r\ninto two great parties, the Federalists and Democrats, when, for the\r\nfirst time, appeared an open and organized opposition to the\r\nAdministration.\r\n\r\nThe funding of the public debt and chartering the United States Bank\r\nwere opposed by Maclay, even at a sacrifice of personal popularity, for\r\nhe was succeeded in the Senate by James Ross, a pronounced Federalist.\r\n\r\nWhile in the Senate Maclay preserved notes of his discussions, both in\r\nopen and executive sessions, with observations upon the social customs\r\nof the statesmen of the Republic, which have since been published.\r\n\r\nOn his retirement from the Senate William Maclay resided on his farm\r\nadjoining Harrisburg, where he erected a fine stone mansion, afterward,\r\nfor many years, occupied by the Harrisburg Academy.\r\n\r\nIn 1795 he was elected a member of the Pennsylvania House of\r\nRepresentatives and was again elected in 1803. He was a presidential\r\ncandidate in 1796, and from 1801 to 1803 was one of the Associate Judges\r\nof Dauphin County.\r\n\r\nWilliam Maclay’s brother, Samuel, was almost as distinguished a citizen\r\nas his older brother. He, too, was a soldier in the Continental Army, a\r\nsurveyor and statesman. He served as Associate Judge, was in the Fourth\r\nCongress, State Senate and Speaker of that body, and December 14, 1802,\r\nhe was elected to the United States Senate. William and Samuel Maclay\r\nare the only brothers to sit in that body.\r\n\r\nWilliam Maclay was the father of nine children. He died at his home at\r\nHarrisburg April 16, 1804, and was interred in the old Paxton\r\nPresbyterian Church graveyard at Paxtang. An elegant stone marks the\r\nfinal resting place of this distinguished Pennsylvanian.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Colonel James Cameron, First Pennsylvania\r\n               Officer Killed in Civil War July 21, 1861\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may not be generally known that the first officer of his rank to be\r\nkilled in the Civil War was none other than Colonel James Cameron, who\r\ncommanded the Seventy-ninth New York Highlanders, yet was a native of\r\nLancaster County, Pa., a resident of this State, and a brother of the\r\ndistinguished General Simon Cameron.\r\n\r\nThe Cameron family in America is of fighting stock, descendants of the\r\nCamerons of Scotland, who shared their fortunes with the disastrous\r\nCharles Edward, whose star of hope went down on the bloody field of\r\nCulloden. Donald Cameron, their great-grandfather, was a participant in\r\nthat memorable battle, and having escaped the carnage made his way to\r\nAmerica, arriving here about 1746. He afterward fought under the gallant\r\nWolfe upon the heights of Abraham at Quebec.\r\n\r\nOn his mother’s side, Colonel James Cameron was descended from Conrad\r\nPfoutz, one of those sturdy German Protestants, whose faith no terrors\r\ncould conquer. An exile from his native land for conscience sake, he\r\nsought the western wilds, and was for a time the companion of that\r\nfamous Indian fighter, Captain Samuel Brady, the history of whose life\r\nis more captivating than romance.\r\n\r\nJames Cameron was born at Maytown, Lancaster County, March 1, 1801, and\r\nspent his boyhood there. He was apprenticed to his older brother, Simon,\r\nin the printing trade, and as early as 1827 he became associated with\r\nJohn Brandon in the publication of the “Lycoming Gazette,” at\r\nWilliamsport, but only for a short time, as the business was not\r\nsuccessful, and in December of that year the paper was sold to William\r\nF. Packer, who later became Governor of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nJames Cameron returned to Lancaster County and in 1829 obtained control\r\nof “The Political Sentinel,” which he published for a few years only. In\r\n1839 he was appointed superintendent of motive power on the Columbia\r\nRailroad, succeeding Andrew Mehaffy. In 1843 he was appointed Deputy\r\nAttorney General of the Mayor’s Court, at Lancaster, succeeding S. Humes\r\nPorter.\r\n\r\nThus we find he worked his way through various steps from an orphan in\r\npoverty to a position of distinction in business and society.\r\n\r\nWhen the Northern Central Railroad was constructed he held an official\r\nposition under the management with headquarters at Sunbury. It was about\r\nthis time that he purchased a magnificent farm along the beautiful\r\nSusquehanna River, just below the borough of Milton.\r\n\r\nJames Cameron was also stung with the political bee which seemed to hunt\r\nCameron victims for many years in Pennsylvania. In 1856 he sought a seat\r\nin Congress, but was defeated for the Democratic nomination.\r\n\r\nWhen the Civil War broke out he was called to the command of the\r\nSeventy-ninth New York Regiment of Volunteers, known as the\r\n“Highlanders,” and he marched at the head of his command on the\r\never-memorable advance on Bull Run.\r\n\r\nHe repeatedly rallied his men, who seemed paralyzed at the reverse, and\r\nnone of his men felt this more than the brave colonel. He dropped his\r\nsword from his hand as he stared at the retreating mass of troops. Some\r\nof his command were still firing, when one of his lieutenants rushed\r\nforward to receive orders about the wounded soldiers. The colonel turned\r\nsuddenly towards him, when at that instant a minnie bullet pierced his\r\nheart and he fell without uttering a word.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Colonel Cameron the rout became complete and the army\r\nfell back in great confusion on Washington.\r\n\r\nColonel Cameron’s body with hundreds of others, was left on the field\r\nand afterwards buried in a trench. Through the efforts of his brother,\r\nGeneral Simon Cameron, then Secretary of War in President Lincoln’s\r\nCabinet, his grave was located and his body identified by the peculiar\r\nbuckskin shirt he wore, and was removed from the place of its rude\r\nburial. The remains were taken to Lewisburg and reinterred with the\r\nmilitary honors due such a hero. Colonel Cameron left a wife, but no\r\nissue.\r\n\r\nColonel Cameron was the first soldier from Northumberland County to lose\r\nhis life in the war. He was the first officer of his rank in the Union\r\nArmy and the first officer from Pennsylvania to fall in battle in the\r\nCivil War.\r\n\r\nThe Northumberland County Soldiers’ Monument Memorial Association was\r\norganized May 25, 1872, and incorporated August 5, following.\r\n\r\nOn July 4, 1872, a site at the eastern end of Market square in Sunbury,\r\nwas marked out by Judge Alexander Jordan and General Simon Cameron, and\r\nfrom that time plans were perfected for the erection of a memorial which\r\nshould do justice to the boys from “Old Mother Northumberland” who had\r\nmade the supreme sacrifice in that greatest of all civil wars in the\r\nworld’s history.\r\n\r\nThe cornerstone was laid May 30, 1874, with a great Masonic ceremony.\r\nRobert L. Muench, of Harrisburg, district deputy grand master, acting\r\nfor the grand master, was in charge of the exercises, assisted by Maclay\r\nC. Gearhart, Henry Y. Fryling, James M. McDevitt, Jacob R. Cressinger\r\nand William Hoover, the elective officers of Lodge No. 22, Free and\r\nAccepted Masons, of Sunbury.\r\n\r\nThere were many distinguished members of the order in attendance,\r\nhundreds of veterans of the Civil War, including a large delegation of\r\nthe Seventy-ninth New York Cameronian Volunteers and thousands of\r\ncitizens from Sunbury and the nearby towns.\r\n\r\nThe monument itself is an imposing shaft, resting upon a pedestal\r\nelevated upon a mound. At the outer edge are mounted four cannon used in\r\nthe Civil War.\r\n\r\nThis shaft is surmounted by a lifesize statue in granite, of the gallant\r\nColonel Cameron. It represents him clad in his military uniform and\r\nstanding “at ease.” A tablet in one of the panels bears this\r\ninscription:\r\n\r\n“James Cameron, of Northumberland County, Colonel of the Seventy-ninth\r\nNew York Cameronian Volunteers. Fell at the head of his regiment at the\r\nBattle of Bull Run, July 21, 1861, aged sixty-one years.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Battle of Minisink Fought Opposite\r\n                        Lackawaxen July 22, 1779\r\n\r\n\r\nOn July 22, 1779, near what is now the little town of Lackawaxen, Pike\r\nCounty, Pa., was fought one of the fiercest Indian battles on record.\r\nThis massacre actually took place in the State of New York at Minisink,\r\nwhere the town of Port Jervis, Orange County, now is. Only the Delaware\r\nRiver separated the battleground from Pike County, in this State.\r\n\r\nThe Shawnee at Minisink are said to have built a town on the east side\r\nof the Delaware, three miles south of the mouth of Flat Brook, which was\r\ncalled Pechoquealin. They also had a town on the Pennsylvania side of\r\nthe river which had the same name, and probably stood near the site of\r\nthe present town of Shawnee, at the mouth of Shawnee Run, in what is now\r\nLower Smithfield Township, Monroe County.\r\n\r\nSecretary James Logan stated in a letter to Governor Clark, of New York,\r\ndated August 4, 1737, that when the Shawnee came from the South in 1692\r\none party of them “was placed at Pechoquealin, near Durham, to take care\r\nof the iron mines.” Their village was probably on the high ground back\r\nof the lower end of Rieglesville, and near the furnace, where traces of\r\nan Indian town still are to be seen.\r\n\r\nThe territory known as the Minisinks was often the scene of strife with\r\nthe red men, and almost every dell, in what is now Pike County, Pa., and\r\nOrange County, N. Y., has its local tradition.\r\n\r\nCount Pulaski and his legion of cavalry were stationed at Minisink,\r\nduring part of the winter of 1778–79. In February he was ordered to\r\nSouth Carolina to join the army under Lincoln. The settlement was thus\r\nleft wholly unprotected, which being perceived by Joseph Brant, the\r\naccomplished Indian warrior, he resolved to make a descent upon it.\r\n\r\nEarly in July, Joseph Brant, the daring and treacherous Mohawk chief,\r\nleft the Susquehanna with some 400 warriors. The settlers had received\r\ntimely warning and threw out scouts to watch the approach of the\r\ninvaders.\r\n\r\nOn the night of July 19 the Indians, with Tories disguised as savages,\r\nstole upon the little town of Minisink, where Port Jervis now stands,\r\nand before the people were aroused from their slumbers several dwellings\r\nwere set on fire. Without means of defense, the inhabitants sought\r\nsafety in flight to the mountains. Their small stockade fort, a mill and\r\ntwelve houses and barns were burned, several persons killed, some taken\r\nprisoners, cattle driven away and the booty carried to Grassy Brook,\r\nwhere Brant had left the main body of his warriors.\r\n\r\nWhile these events were being enacted a call for volunteers was\r\nresponded to and 150 men met the following morning, determined to pursue\r\nthe savages.\r\n\r\nColonel Tusten, who knew the craftiness of Brant, opposed pursuit, but\r\nwas overruled. Major Meeker, mounting his horse, shouted, “Let the brave\r\nmen follow me; the cowards may stay behind.” The line of march was\r\nformed, and they traveled seventeen miles, then encamped for the night.\r\n\r\nThe march was resumed the morning of July 22, and at Half-Way Brook came\r\nupon the Indian encampment of the previous night. The number of\r\nsmoldering fires indicated a large savage force, and the two colonels,\r\nwith the more prudent, advocated a return rather than further pursuit.\r\nThe majority determined to pursue.\r\n\r\nA scouting party was sent forward, but was discovered and the captain\r\nslain. The volunteers pressed onward, and at 9 o’clock the enemy could\r\nbe seen marching in the direction of the fording place. Brant had\r\nalready deposited a large part of his plunder in Pike County. The\r\ncommander of the volunteers determined to intercept them at the ford,\r\nbut Brant had been watching the movements of his pursuers and,\r\ncomprehending their designs, he wheeled his column and by a strategic\r\nmovement brought his whole force in the rear of the Americans. Here he\r\nformed an ambuscade and deliberately selected his battleground.\r\n\r\nThe volunteers were surprised and disappointed at not finding the enemy\r\nwhere they expected him to be, and were marching back when they\r\ndiscovered some of the Indians. One of them, mounted on a horse stolen\r\nat Minisink, was shot. This was a signal for action, and the firing soon\r\nbecame general. It was a long and bloody conflict.\r\n\r\nThe Indians greatly outnumbered the whites, and as the ammunition of the\r\nlatter was limited, they were careful not to fire at random, but to make\r\nevery shot count. The fight began at 11 o’clock and at twilight was yet\r\nundecided. The ammunition of the militia was expended and the enemy\r\nattacked and broke through their line.\r\n\r\nThe survivors attempted to retreat. Behind a ledge of rocks, Doctor\r\nTusten was dressing the wounds of seventeen who were injured. The\r\nIndians fell upon them furiously, and all, including the doctor, were\r\nslain.\r\n\r\nSome attempted escape by swimming the river; the Indians killed many,\r\nbut a few reached the wilds of Pike County. A few more escaped under the\r\ncover of darkness. Of the whole number that went forth, only thirty\r\nreturned to relate the dreadful scenes of that day.\r\n\r\nThis massacre of the wounded is one of the darkest stains upon the\r\nmemory of Brant, whose honor and humanity were often more conspicuous\r\nthan that of his Tory allies.\r\n\r\nHe made a weak defense of his conduct by asserting he had offered good\r\ntreatment if they would surrender and that his humane proposition was\r\nanswered by a bullet from an American musket, which pierced his belt.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1822, the bones of friend and foe were picked up, put in\r\nboxes, taken to Goshen, in Orange County, and given a decent burial, and\r\na beautiful monument marks the spot where the mortal remains of the\r\nheroes lay who fought what is known as the battle of Minisink.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  General Howe Sails From New York to\r\n                  Capture Philadelphia, July 23, 1777\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Howe, commander of the British forces in America, sailed with\r\nhis army from New York, July 23, 1777, to make a mighty effort to end\r\nthe Revolution by capturing Philadelphia, the seat of government of the\r\nContinental Congress. His intentions were to approach the city by the\r\nDelaware.\r\n\r\nSoon as this became known every effort was made for the defense of the\r\nriver. Howe experienced much difficulty, therefore, in navigating his\r\nimmense naval armament and meeting these obstructions in the Delaware\r\nBay, he decided to make his approach by way of the Chesapeake, where he\r\nanchored at the head of the bay, in Elk River, August 25.\r\n\r\nHowe disembarked with 18,000 troops, well equipped, except for horses.\r\nThe movement was delayed by heavy rains, but when they reached Elkton\r\nthe Philadelphia Light Horse, under Colonel Patterson retired, but\r\nannoyed the enemy by skirmishing.\r\n\r\nOn September 3, the militia and light horse with 720 Continentals, under\r\nGeneral Maxwell, kept up an attack which checked somewhat the progress\r\ntowards Philadelphia of two divisions of British, under Cornwallis and\r\nKnyphausen.\r\n\r\nWashington marched his army through Philadelphia to encourage the\r\npartisans of independence and overawe the disaffected, and took up a\r\nposition between Chester and Wilmington.\r\n\r\nOn hearing of the actual invasion of Pennsylvania the Supreme Executive\r\nCouncil issued a proclamation entreating all persons to march instantly\r\nto the assistance of General Washington, to enable him to demolish the\r\nonly British army that remained formidable in America or in the world.\r\n\r\nThose addressed were asked to consider the wanton ravages, the rapes,\r\nthe butcheries perpetrated in New Jersey, and on the frontier of New\r\nYork, and the prospect of Americans being “like the wretched inhabitants\r\nof India, stripped of their freedom, robbed of their property, degraded\r\nbeneath brutes, and left to starve amid plenty at the will of their\r\nlordly masters.”\r\n\r\nWashington had moved from White Clay Creek, leaving only the riflemen in\r\ncamp, and with the main body of his army retired behind the Red Clay\r\nCreek, occupying with his right wing the town of Newport, upon the great\r\nroad to Philadelphia; his left was at Hockhesson.\r\n\r\nWhen Howe brought the army to attack the right flank on September 9, the\r\nAmericans had slipped away and crossed the Brandywine at Chadd’s Ford in\r\nChester County, where they awaited the enemy. General Sullivan commanded\r\nthe right, General Armstrong the left. The riflemen of Maxwell scoured\r\nthe right bank of the Brandywine, in order to harass and retard the\r\nenemy. Stephen’s and Lord Sterling’s divisions were under General\r\nSullivan.\r\n\r\nThe British reached Kennett Square September 10. The next morning half\r\nthe British army, led by Howe and Cornwallis, moved up the valley road\r\nto cross at the forks of the creek. At 10 o’clock Knyphausen began a\r\ncannonade at Chadd’s Ford.\r\n\r\nSullivan crossed the creek above, while Washington with Greene’s\r\ndivision was to attack Knyphausen, but Sullivan was too late and had not\r\nmade the crossing when the attack began, for Cornwallis had made the\r\ncrossing as intended and came down upon the Americans. Sterling and\r\nStephen faced his attack southwest of the Birmingham meeting house.\r\nSullivan should have taken his division to their right, and when he\r\nstarted to change his position, he was put to flight and lost his\r\nartillery.\r\n\r\nThe story of the Battle of the Brandywine will not be repeated, except\r\nto state that after a terrible day’s battle the Americans retreated at\r\nnightfall, having lost 1000 killed and wounded, Lafayette among the\r\nlatter. Howe’s army did not pursue in the darkness, and Washington\r\nreached Chester. Thence it went to Germantown and collected provisions\r\nand ammunition. Battalions of militia joined the main body at the Falls\r\nof the Schuylkill and at Darby.\r\n\r\nThe public money of Pennsylvania was sent to Easton, the Liberty Bell\r\nand church bells at Philadelphia were sent to Bethlehem and Allentown,\r\nthe Market Street bridge was removed and the boats at the ferries of the\r\nSchuylkill brought to the city side.\r\n\r\nWashington advanced to the Lancaster road, and Howe and Cornwallis left\r\nthe vicinity of Chester and marched toward the road through what is now\r\nWest Chester and by Goshen Meeting, and the Sign of the Boot Inn, which\r\nGeneral Howe occupied and made his headquarters.\r\n\r\nThe two armies on September 16, were drawn in battle array near the\r\nWhite Horse Inn on the Lancaster Road, where a fight occurred between\r\nCount Donop and his Hessians and “Mad Anthony” Wayne without much\r\nresult. A violent and incessant rain storm prevented any general action.\r\n\r\nDuring this storm the American army suffered a heavy loss in ammunition,\r\nwhich got wet; so it turned aside until a new supply could be obtained.\r\nThe enemy moved toward Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThe day after the battle of Brandywine, toward evening, the British\r\ndispatched a detachment of light troops to Wilmington. There they took\r\nprisoner the Governor of the State of Delaware, and seized a\r\nconsiderable quantity of coined money, as well as other property, both\r\npublic and private, and some papers of importance.\r\n\r\nGeneral Mifflin was too ill to take command of the defense of\r\nPhiladelphia, and all was confusion, when at 1 o’clock in the morning of\r\nSeptember 19, the alarm was given that the British had crossed the\r\nSchuylkill.\r\n\r\nLord Cornwallis entered Philadelphia September 26, at the head of\r\nBritish and Hessian grenadiers. The rest of the army remained in camp at\r\nGermantown.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Captain John Smith Sails From Jamestown,\r\n                  July 24, 1608, to Explore Chesapeake\r\n                                  Bay\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo Indian messengers hurried to the Susquehannock Indian town situated\r\non the banks of the Susquehanna River, in what is now Lancaster County,\r\nin midsummer, 1608, and brought the tidings that there were strangers\r\narrived in the great bay who wished to see them. The Susquehanna\r\nIndians, or Susquehannocks, as they are usually called, went to meet\r\nthese white men, whom they believed to be gods worthy of worship.\r\n\r\nThe strangers were thirteen in number, and under the leadership of\r\nCaptain John Smith, who had effected a settlement at Jamestown, Va., the\r\npreceding year. They had sailed away from Jamestown, July 24, on a\r\nvoyage of discovery in an open boat of less than three tons burden.\r\n\r\nThe party had a tedious voyage. The vessel entered Chesapeake Bay, and\r\nthe party spent seven weeks exploring its shores, returning to Jamestown\r\nSeptember 7.\r\n\r\nIt was after Smith reached the head of the bay, on the Tockwogh\r\n(Sassafras) River, that he first met Indians. Here he found “many\r\nhatchets, knives and peeces of yron and brasse, which they reported to\r\nhave from the Sasquesahanockes, a mighty people, and mortal enemies with\r\nthe Massawomeckes.”\r\n\r\nSmith approached these Indians warily, for he had already heard of them\r\nas a ferocious tribe. Smith “prevailed with the Interpreter to take with\r\nhim another interpreter, to perswade the Sasquesahoncks to come to visit\r\nus, for their language are different.”\r\n\r\nSmith made a visit to the tribe on the east side of the Chesapeake the\r\nfollowing morning, and they received him in friendship.\r\n\r\nHe navigated his boats as far up the Susquehanna as was possible on\r\naccount of the rocks, and there awaited the return of the two Indian\r\nmessengers. In four days they arrived, and with them came the Indians.\r\nCaptain Smith’s own story says:\r\n\r\n“Sixty Susquehannocks came to us, with skins, bows, arrowes, targets,\r\nbeeds, swords & tobacco pipes for presents. Such great and well\r\nproportioned men are seldom seen, for they seemed like giants to the\r\nEnglish, yea, and to the neighbors, yet seemed of an honest and simple\r\ndisposition. They were with much adoe restrained from adoring us as\r\ngods.\r\n\r\n“These are the strangest people of all these countries, both in language\r\nand attire; for their language may well become their proportions;\r\nsounding from them as a voyce in the vault. Their attire is the skinnes\r\nof bears, and wolves, some have cossacks made of beares heads and\r\nskinnes, that a man’s head goes through the skinnes neck, and the eares\r\nof the beare fastened to his shoulders, the nose and teeth hanging down\r\nhis breast, another beares face split behind him, and at the end of the\r\nnose hung a paw, the half sleeves coming to the elbowes were the necks\r\nof the beares, and the arms through the mouth with the pawes hanging at\r\ntheir noses. One had the head of a wolfe hanging in a chain for a\r\njewell, his tobacco-pipe three-quarters of a yard long, prettily carved\r\nwith a bird, a deare, or some such devise at the great end, sufficient\r\nto beat out ones braines; with bowes, arrowes, and clubs, sutable to\r\ntheir greatness. Five of their chiefe warriors came aboord us and\r\ncrossed the bay in the barge. The picture of the greatest of them is\r\nsignified in the mappe.\r\n\r\n“The calf of whose leg was three quarters of a yard about, and all the\r\nrest of his limbs so answerable to that proportion that he seemed the\r\ngoodliest man we ever beheld. His hayre, the one side was long, the\r\nother shore close with a ridge over his crowne like a cocks combe. His\r\narrowes were five quarters long, headed with the splinters of a white\r\nchristall-like stone, in form of a heart, an inch broad, an inch and a\r\nhalfe or more long. These he wore in a woolves skinne at his backe for\r\nhis quiver, his bow in the one hand and his clubbe in the other, as is\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n“They can make neere 600 able and mighty men, and are pallisadoed in\r\ntheir townes to defend them from the Massawomekes, their mortal enemies\r\n* * * They are seated (on the Susquehanna River) 2 daies higher than was\r\npassage for the discoverer’s barge.”\r\n\r\nSmith further describes the Susquehannocks, and very much exaggerates\r\ntheir strength of numbers and other qualifications, but there can be no\r\ndoubt that the great adventurer was thoroughly impressed with this\r\npowerful tribe. This was the first contact of white men with the native\r\npeople of Pennsylvania. Smith almost reached Pennsylvania on this\r\nvoyage.\r\n\r\nHis map of Virginia made in 1612 also shows a number of Indian villages\r\nin the interior of Pennsylvania. Besides the town of Sasquesahanough, he\r\nlocates on the east bank of the Susquehanna, near its head, Tesinigh,\r\nand about midway between these two, Quadroque, which is also on the east\r\nbank. Near the heads of two tributaries of the same river he locates\r\nAttaock, and some distance north, Utchowig. Mr. A. L. Guss places\r\nAttaock as on the Juniata; Quadroque at or near the forks of the North\r\nand West Branches; Tesinigh on the North Branch, towards Wyoming; and\r\nUtchowig, Mr. Guss suggests might have been a town of the Erie, or Cat\r\nNation.\r\n\r\nDuring another voyage in December, 1607, Captain Smith was taken\r\nprisoner by the Indians, but afterwards released on promise to furnish a\r\nransom of two great guns and a grindstone. Tradition says that he was\r\nsaved from death during this captivity by Pocahontas.\r\n\r\nSmith made maps of his exploration and, in 1614, explored the New\r\nEngland coast and made a map of that shore from the Penobscot to Cape\r\nCod.\r\n\r\nCaptain Smith served as president of the colony of Jamestown, but he was\r\ntoo strict a disciplinarian. When his successor was elected, September\r\n29, 1609, Smith sailed for England and never returned to Jamestown.\r\n\r\nHe had achieved much for Virginia, he was a good example of Elizabethian\r\nversatility, “bookman, penman, swordsman, diplomat, sailor, courtier,\r\norator, explorer.” His works have been published.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Colonel Thompson’s Battalion of Riflemen\r\n                      Among First to Reach Boston,\r\n                             July 25, 1775\r\n\r\n\r\nColonel Thompson’s Battalion of Riflemen, so styled in General\r\nWashington’s general orders, was one of the Pennsylvania regiments in\r\nthe Revolutionary War of which every citizen has pardonable right to be\r\nproud.\r\n\r\nThis command was enlisted in the latter part of June, and in the\r\nbeginning of July, 1775, in pursuance of a resolution of Congress, dated\r\nJune 14, for raising six companies of expert riflemen in Pennsylvania,\r\ntwo in Maryland, and two in Virginia, which, as soon as completed, were\r\nto join the army near Boston.\r\n\r\nBy a resolution adopted June 22, the “Colony of Pennsylvania” was\r\ndirected to raise two more companies, which with the six, were to be\r\nformed into a battalion, and be commanded by such officers as the\r\nAssembly or Convention should recommend.\r\n\r\nThis resolution having been communicated to the Assembly of\r\nPennsylvania, it resolved, June 24, “that the members of Congress\r\ndeputed by this Assembly be a committee to consider of, and recommend\r\nproper officers of the said battalion.”\r\n\r\nThis committee performed the duty thus delegated them and William\r\nThompson, of Carlisle, was commissioned colonel; Edward Hand, of\r\nLancaster, lieutenant colonel; Robert Magaw, of Carlisle, major; and\r\nWilliam Magaw, Carlisle, surgeon.\r\n\r\nEach company in this battalion consisted of one captain, three\r\nlieutenants, four sergeants, four corporals, a drummer or trumpeter, and\r\nsixty-eight privates.\r\n\r\nOn July 11 Congress was informed that two companies had been raised in\r\nLancaster instead of one, and it resolved that both companies be taken\r\ninto the Continental service. The battalion, therefore, consisted of\r\nnine companies, enlisted as follows:\r\n\r\nJames Chambers and William Hendricks in Cumberland County; Michael\r\nDoudel in York County; James Ross and Matthew Smith in Lancaster County;\r\nJohn Lowden in Northumberland County; Robert Cluggage in Bedford County;\r\nGeorge Nagel in Berks County; and Abraham Miller in Northampton County.\r\n\r\nThe pay of the officers and privates was as follows: Captain, twenty\r\ndollars per month; a lieutenant, thirteen and one-third dollars;\r\nsergeant, eight; corporal, seven and one-third; drummer, the same;\r\nprivates, six and two-thirds, and to find their own arms and clothes.\r\n\r\nThe patriotism of Pennsylvania was still further evinced in the haste\r\nwith which these companies of Colonel Thompson’s battalion were filled\r\nto overflowing and the promptitude with which they took up their march.\r\n\r\nEight of the companies arrived at Boston by July 25, which may properly\r\nbe the date the activities of these riflemen actually began.\r\n\r\nA large number of gentlemen went along as independent volunteers. Their\r\nnames were not entered on the rolls, and they claimed the privilege of\r\npaying their own expenses and returning at their pleasure. Among them\r\nwere Edward Burd, afterwards prothonotary of the Supreme Court, Jesse\r\nLukens and Matthew Duncan.\r\n\r\nThe command got into action almost upon its arrival at Cambridge.\r\n\r\nThe Military Journal of the Revolution described this battalion as\r\n“remarkably stout and hardy men; many of them exceeding six feet in\r\nheight. They are dressed in white frocks or rifle shirts and round hats.\r\nThese men are remarkable for the accuracy of their aim; striking a mark\r\nwith great certainty at 200 yards distance. At a review, a company of\r\nthem, while on a quick advance, fired their balls into objects of seven\r\ninches diameter, at a distance of 250 yards. They are now stationed in\r\nour lines, and their shot have frequently proved fatal to British\r\nofficers and soldiers who expose themselves to view, even at more than\r\ndouble the distance of common musket shot.”\r\n\r\nThe battalion became the Second regiment (after January 1, 1776, the\r\nFirst regiment) of the army of the United Colonies.\r\n\r\nThis regiment formed the picket guard of the 2,000 provincials, who, on\r\nthe evening of August 26, took possession of and threw up intrenchments\r\non Ploughed Hill, and on the following morning met with its first loss,\r\nPrivate William Simpson, of Paxtang, a member of Captain Matthew Smith’s\r\ncompany, who was wounded in the leg in front of Boston. A cannon ball\r\nshattered his leg, which was amputated but the lad died three days\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nThe first soldier to make the supreme sacrifice was a brother of\r\nLieutenant, afterward General Michael Simpson, and of John Simpson, for\r\nyears recorder of Northumberland County.\r\n\r\nOn September 5 the companies of Captain Matthew Smith and Captain\r\nWilliam Hendricks were ordered to join the expedition against Quebec,\r\ncommanded by General Benedict Arnold.\r\n\r\nAn interesting account of the hardships and sufferings of these two\r\ncompanies was written by Judge John Joseph Henry, of Lancaster, a\r\nprivate in Smith’s company. At the attack on Quebec, December 31,\r\nCaptain Hendricks was killed, and those who did not fall were taken\r\nprisoners, and held until paroled August 7, 1776.\r\n\r\nThe balance of Colonel Thompson’s command earned the public thanks of\r\nGeneral Washington for services rendered at Lechmere’s Point, November\r\n9, 1775. In this action the men waded through the tide up to their\r\narmpits and drove the British from their cover and into their boats.\r\nColonel Thompson lost only one killed and three wounded. British loss\r\nwas seventeen killed and one wounded.\r\n\r\nJanuary 1, 1776, the new army organization was commenced and this\r\nbattalion became the First Regiment of the Continental Army. Colonel\r\nThompson was promoted to brigadier general, March 1, 1776, and Edward\r\nHand became colonel. He was later promoted to brigadier. The First\r\nPennsylvania participated with General Sullivan in New York and Long\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\nWashington wrote to Congress, on April 22, 1776:\r\n\r\n“The time for which the riflemen enlisted will expire on the 1st of July\r\nnext, and as the loss of such a valuable and brave body of men will be\r\nof great injury to the service, I would submit it to the consideration\r\nof Congress whether it would not be best to adopt some method to induce\r\nthem to continue. They are, indeed, a very useful corps; but I need not\r\nmention this, as their importance is already well known to the\r\nCongress.”\r\n\r\nOn July 1 the battalion entered upon another term of service.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n           Indians Massacre Inhabitants in the Conococheague\r\n                        Valley on July 26, 1756\r\n\r\n\r\nJuly 26 is a date which recalls to the minds of many inhabitants of the\r\npresent Franklin County two atrocities committed by Indians, either of\r\nwhich is horrible in its every detail.\r\n\r\nOn July 26, 1756, the Indians killed Joseph Martin, and took captive two\r\nbrothers, named John and James McCullough, all residents of the\r\nConococheague settlement. This was followed, August 27, with a great\r\nslaughter, wherein the Indians killed thirty-nine persons, near the\r\nmouth of the Conococheague Creek.\r\n\r\nEarly in November following, the Indians discovered some soldiers of the\r\ngarrison at Fort McDowell, a few miles distant, ambushed them and killed\r\nand scalped Privates James McDonald, William McDonald, Bartholemew\r\nMcCafferty, and Anthony McQuoid; and carried off Captain James Corken\r\nand Private William Cornwall. The following inhabitants were killed:\r\nJohn Culbertson, Samuel Perry, Hugh Kerrel, John Woods and his\r\nmother-in-law, and Elizabeth Archer; and carried off four children\r\nbelonging to John Archer; and two lads named Samuel Neily and James\r\nMcQuoid.\r\n\r\nTo return to the first atrocity. James McCullough had but a few years\r\nbefore removed from Delaware to what is now Montgomery Township,\r\nFranklin County, where he immediately began to clear the land and till\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\nThe McCullough family had been temporarily living in a cabin three miles\r\ndistant from their home, and the parents and their daughter, Mary, went\r\nhome to pull flax. A neighbor, John Allen, who had business at Fort\r\nLoudon accompanied them, and promised to come that way in the evening\r\nand go along back to the cabin.\r\n\r\nAllen had proceeded about two miles when he learned that the Indians had\r\nthat morning killed a man, a short distance from the McCullough home.\r\nAllen failed to keep his promise and returned by a circuitous route.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the McCulloughs he told the lads to hide, that Indians\r\nwere near at hand, and added, at the same time, that he supposed they\r\nhad killed their parents.\r\n\r\nJohn McCullough was eight years old and James but five. They alarmed\r\ntheir neighbors, but all hurried to make preparations to go to the fort,\r\na mile distant. None would volunteer to warn Mr. and Mrs. McCullough of\r\ntheir danger, so the lads determined to do it themselves. They left\r\ntheir little sister, Elizabeth, aged two years sleeping in bed.\r\n\r\nThe brave lads reached a point where they could see their house and\r\nbegan to halloo. They were happy to reach their parents in safety. When\r\nabout sixty yards from the house, five Indians and one Frenchman came\r\nrushing out of the thicket and took the lads captive. The Indians missed\r\ncapturing the parents by the mere accident that the father had heard the\r\nlads and left his work to meet them and thus the Indians missed him, and\r\nfailed to notice the mother and daughter in a field at work.\r\n\r\nThe lads were taken to the forks of the Ohio, whence James, the younger,\r\nwas carried into Canada and all trace of him lost. John remained with\r\nthe Indians for nine years, when he and hundreds of other captives were\r\nreleased. They eventually were able to find their way back to their\r\nhomes in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia.\r\n\r\nJohn lived in the community from which he had been taken for nearly\r\nsixty years and left a written record of what he suffered during this\r\nlong captivity.\r\n\r\nThe other Indian massacres, which inhabitants of the Conococheague\r\nValley will ever relate, began with the appearance of savages on Sunday,\r\nJuly 22, 1764, when several were discovered near Fort Loudon.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday Susan King Cunningham left her home and started through the\r\nwoods to call on a neighbor. As she did not return when expected a\r\nsearch was made, and soon her body was found lying near her home. The\r\nfiends had not been content to murder and scalp this good woman, but had\r\nperformed a Caesarian operation and had placed her child on the ground\r\nbeside her.\r\n\r\nThe next day, July 26, occurred the murder of Enoch Brown, schoolmaster,\r\nand ten of his pupils. A tragedy unique in the long story of Indian\r\natrocities.\r\n\r\nThis terrible massacre occurred about three miles north of Greencastle,\r\nFranklin County. Brown and each of the ten small children were killed\r\nand scalped, and a lad, Archibald McCullough, was scalped and left for\r\ndead among the other victims, but he recovered and lived for many years.\r\n\r\nWith few exceptions the scholars were much averse to going to school\r\nthat morning. And the account afterward given by McCullough is that two\r\nof the scholars informed Mr. Brown that on their way to school they had\r\nseen Indians. The master paid no attention to what had been told him,\r\nand ordered them to their books.\r\n\r\nSoon after school had opened three Indians rushed up to the door. The\r\nschoolmaster, seeing them, prayed the Indians only to take his life and\r\nspare the children, but they refused. The Indians stood at the door,\r\nwhilst the third entered the school room, and with a piece of wood in\r\nthe shape of a maul, killed the master and the scholars, after which all\r\nof them were scalped.\r\n\r\nYoung McCollough, left for dead, dragged himself to a spring a short\r\ndistance from the school house where he slaked his burning thirst and\r\nwashed his wound.\r\n\r\nThis Archie was a cousin of John and James McCullough, taken by the\r\nIndians in that same place exactly eight years before. John was at that\r\ntime a captive and living with the Indians. In his interesting narrative\r\nhe says that he knew the three Indians who murdered Brown and the\r\nchildren, and that he was present when they returned to their chief.\r\n\r\nThey were young Indians, not over twenty years of age. Old Night Walker,\r\nthe chief, called them cowards for having so many children’s scalps.\r\n\r\nThus it is a singular coincidence that these two crimes should be\r\ncommitted on July 26, that McCulloughs should figure in them both, and\r\nthat the only accurate details of each massacre are given by the only\r\ntwo survivors, John and Archie McCullough, yet they occurred eight years\r\napart.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Ruffians Mob Pastor and Cause Organization\r\n                 of First Moravian Church July 27, 1742\r\n\r\n\r\nAn affair occurred in Philadelphia July 27, 1742, which, disgraceful as\r\nwere the proceedings, was the means of establishing a separate Moravian\r\nChurch in that city.\r\n\r\nCount Nicholas Ludwig Zinzindorf arrived in Philadelphia, December 10,\r\n1741. He came with the hope of uniting all Protestant Christians into a\r\nconfederacy or league.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately upon his arrival Henry Antes, a pious wheel-wright\r\nand farmer in Falkner’s Swamp, now Frederick Township, Montgomery\r\nCounty, invited Zinzindorf to attend a synod or conference at\r\nGermantown, which had for its object a movement similar to that of the\r\ndistinguished visitor.\r\n\r\nZinzindorf accepted the invitation and attended the Synod, January 12,\r\n1742. Indeed he went there before that date, and preached in the German\r\nReformed Church, January 1, his first sermon in America. He got\r\nacquainted with the people and earnestly began his great work.\r\n\r\nThis Synod was the first of seven. It was held in the house of Theobold\r\nEndt, a Germantown clockmaker. Zinzindorf was made moderator.\r\n\r\nThe delegates of the different sects met and discussed the best way of\r\nbringing about a more perfect union of all Protestant denominations.\r\nThere were a number of Moravians present, but not as delegates, for no\r\nsettled congregation of that sect as yet existed.\r\n\r\nNo definite results were reached though Zinzindorf’s ideas impressed the\r\nassemblies.\r\n\r\nDuring the earlier months of 1742 Zinzindorf preached at Oley, Falkner’s\r\nSwamp, Germantown, and other places, and gathered the nuclei of\r\nsubsequent Moravian congregations.\r\n\r\nA house was rented in Germantown for Count Zinzindorf and his\r\nassistants, which was opened as a school May 4, of that year. The\r\nCountess Benigna assisted as a teacher, as did also Anna Nitschmann, who\r\nsubsequently became the second wife of Zinzindorf. The school opened\r\nwith twenty-five girls as pupils.\r\n\r\nIn Philadelphia Zinzindorf began ministrations in a barn on Arch Street\r\nbelow Fifth, then fitted up with seats and used in partnership by the\r\nGerman Reformed and the Lutherans.\r\n\r\nHis Lutheran tendencies and training fitted him to take charge of a\r\nLutheran Church, and May 30, 1742, this congregation called him to take\r\nits charge. Indeed, it is said that he claimed to be inspector-general\r\nof the Lutherans, and had for some months supplied a Lutheran Church in\r\nGermantown.\r\n\r\nZinzindorf accepted the call of the Philadelphia Lutherans, but wishing\r\nto do a certain amount of missionary work elsewhere, associated John\r\nChristopher Pyrlaeus, a Saxony Presbyter, with him as assistant, and\r\nleft matters much in his charge.\r\n\r\nReverend Henry Jacobson, in his “History of the Moravian Church in\r\nPhiladelphia,” proceeds to tell what the consequence was.\r\n\r\nPyrlaeus, though evidently a hard worker, gave offense to a strong\r\nfaction, and on July 27, 1742, while in the pulpit and officiating, a\r\ngang of his opponents dragged him down from his place, trampled upon\r\nhim, and roughly handled him, as they ejected him from the building.\r\n\r\nThe only accounts left do not enable us to identify the cowardly\r\nassailants, except that there seems to have been serious trouble between\r\nthe growing Moravian faction and the conservative Lutheran element.\r\n\r\nThe affair was the prime cause of the establishment of a separate\r\nMoravian Church as soon as Count Zinzindorf returned from his preaching\r\ntour. Without this event to crystallize the tendencies of things,\r\nseparation might have been long delayed.\r\n\r\nAnother view of this movement is that Zinzindorf built the church for\r\nthe Lutheran congregation over which he claimed authority, upon his\r\nfirst arrival in the country, but that the arrival of Henry Melchior\r\nMuhlenberg, with direct authority from the University at Halle, in the\r\nlatter part of 1742, changed the tactics of Zinzindorf, and so he made\r\narrangements to transfer the church to the Moravians.\r\n\r\nThe congregation organized by Zinzindorf consisted of thirty-four\r\npersons. They took up a lot on the east side of Bread Street and south\r\nof Sassafras (now Race) Street, which on August 20, 1742, was\r\ntransferred by William Allen and wife to Samuel Powell, Joseph Powell,\r\nEdward Evans, William Rice, John Okley, and Owen Rice, for another lot\r\non Sassafras Street.\r\n\r\nThe parties named were not all Moravians, but the deed was made to them\r\nin trust for “a certain congregation of Christian people, as well German\r\nas English, residing in the City of Philadelphia, belonging to the\r\nchurch of the Evangelical Brethren, who have caused to be erected\r\nthereon a new building for and to their use and service as a church and\r\nschool house to S. Lewis Zinzindorf, David Nitschmann, Joseph\r\nSpangenberg, Henry Antes, John Bloomfield, and Charles Brockden.”\r\n\r\nAdditional real estate was acquired and the church building was\r\ncommenced immediately. The corner stone was laid September 10, 1742, by\r\nCount Zinzindorf, and the work proceeded so rapidly that it was\r\ndedicated by him on November 25, following.\r\n\r\nThis building was set back from Sassafras Street thirty-five feet. It\r\nhad a front of forty-five feet on Bread Street, afterward called\r\nMoravian Alley.\r\n\r\nThe edifice was two stories high, the first story being used as the\r\nchurch proper. This room was twenty feet in height from the floor,\r\nwainscoted about five feet, and whitewashed above to the ceiling. The\r\nroof was of the hip-roof design. There were large windows in each side.\r\nThe congregation used this church for more than fifty years without a\r\nstove in winter.\r\n\r\nThe first Moravian congregation in Philadelphia contained those who had\r\nleft the Lutherans when the Pyrlaeus affair occurred, and a number of\r\nMoravians who had been awhile at Nazareth and Bethlehem.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of his departure from America Count Zinzindorf organized\r\nthese members into the First Moravian Church.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                British and Seneca Indian Allies Destroy\r\n                      Fort Freeland, July 28, 1779\r\n\r\n\r\nMany Pennsylvanians may not know that a definite, well-planned battle of\r\nthe Revolution was fought far up in old Northumberland County. This is a\r\nfact and until now this battle has only been known of as an ordinary\r\nIndian incursion. Such was not the case.\r\n\r\nTrue there were Indians in the battle of Fort Freeland, July 28, 1779,\r\nand they were the ferocious Seneca, 300 of them under the command of\r\nHiokatoo, the most bloodthirsty and cruel Indian of whom we have any\r\ndirect evidence.\r\n\r\nAfter Colonel Thomas Hartley led his successful expedition against the\r\nIndians in 1778, the savages did not long remain subdued, but the year\r\nfollowing again became so vicious that the settlers, who had returned\r\nafter the Great Runaway, lived in such constant fear of attack that\r\nGeneral Washington ordered General John Sullivan to rendezvous his\r\ntroops at Wyoming and wipe out every Indian town from that point to\r\nElmira in New York State.\r\n\r\nThe troops were supplied with rations and stores from Fort Augusta. This\r\nfort was defended by a line of forts, or blockhouses extending in an\r\nalmost straight line from Fort Jenkins near Berwick, on the North\r\nBranch, to Fort Wheeler, at Fishing Creek, to Fort Bostley, at\r\nWashingtonville, to Fort Montgomery, to Fort Freeland, two miles above\r\nMcEwensville, to Fort Muncy, where the line of defense touched the West\r\nBranch.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had General Sullivan started his march from Easton toward\r\nWyoming than the Indians learned of his plans and put into operation a\r\nseries of movements which were intended to defeat the design of the\r\nContinental troops.\r\n\r\nCaptain John MacDonald, of the British Army, a Tory of New York State,\r\nwas in command of a large detachment of British who had employed 300\r\nSeneca Indians as allies. They made a forced march from the vicinity of\r\nWyalusing, and arrived near Fort Muncy on the morning of July 28, 1779,\r\nand immediately started down, over what is now the Susquehanna Trail,\r\ntoward Fort Augusta. The Continental troops had unfortunately been\r\nwithdrawn from Fort Muncy.\r\n\r\nLess than six miles march brought the British and their Indian allies in\r\ncontact with the garrison at Fort Freeland, where, in addition to the\r\ntroops, all the inhabitants of the valley below Muncy Hill and as far\r\nsouth as Chillisquaque Creek, had fled for protection.\r\n\r\nWhen the battle for possession of the fort began, the firing could be\r\nheard at Fort Boone, about four miles south, a mile above the present\r\nsite of Milton. Captain Hawkins Boone, cousin of Daniel Boone, and\r\nhimself one of the bravest soldiers in the Continental army, with a\r\ndetail, consisting of thirty-two as brave men as ever fired a gun,\r\nrushed to the relief of the unfortunate defenders of Fort Freeland.\r\n\r\nBut in a few terrible hours the most advanced haven of refuge for the\r\nfrontier settlers in the West Branch Valley was a mass of ruins; its\r\ndefenders either victims of the tomahawk or prisoners of war; and the\r\nwomen and children objects of charity.\r\n\r\nThe defenders of Fort Freeland did their utmost in this trying hour.\r\nTheir resistance was so stubborn that the articles of capitulation were\r\nnot accepted until the third proposal, and not then until all their\r\nammunition was expended. The women even melted the pewter into bullets,\r\nwhile the men fired them at the besiegers. No further relief was\r\nbelieved possible.\r\n\r\nAfter Captain MacDonald had sent the third demand for surrender, the\r\ndefenders, under a flag of truce, agreed with the victors upon the terms\r\nwhich were as follows:\r\n\r\n“Articles of Capitulation Entd into Between Captain John McDonald on his\r\nMajesties part & John Little on that of the Continental Congress.\r\n\r\n“Article 1st. The Men in Garrison to March out & Ground their Arms in\r\nthe Green, in Front of the Fort which is to be taken in possession of\r\nImmediately by his Majesty’s Troops. Agreed to.\r\n\r\n“2ndly. All Men Bearing Arms are to Surrender themselves Prisoners of\r\nWar & to be Sent to Niagara. Agd. to.\r\n\r\n“3d. The Women and Children not to be Stript of their Clothing nor\r\nMolested by the Indians and to be at Liberty to move down the Country\r\nwhere they please. Agd. to.\r\n\r\n                                               John Mac Donald\r\n                                                   Capt. of Rangers.\r\n                                               John Little.”\r\n\r\nAs soon as the fort capitulated, the Indians took possession of it, and\r\ntheir squaws became mischievous and destructive. Having completed the\r\npillage of the fort, both Indians and British gathered together all the\r\nprovisions they could find and proceeded to the creek, where they made\r\npreparations for a feast, but did not long enjoy it.\r\n\r\nCaptain Boone’s party soon arrived on opposite bank of creek, within\r\nless than one hundred yards of the feast. Not knowing the fort had been\r\nsurrendered, they fired upon the British and Indians. We are advised\r\nthirty fell dead at the first volley. It was but a brief triumph,\r\nhowever, for the others rallied and surrounded the handful of\r\nContinentals, killing thirteen men, among the slain being Captain Boone\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nWhen this party found itself caught in an ambuscade, word was quickly\r\npassed for each man to save himself, thus enabling a few to escape.\r\n\r\nEvery male in the fort had been taken prisoner and started toward\r\nNiagara where the few who survived the hardship of the forced march and\r\nthe privations of the long imprisonment, remained until after the close\r\nof the war, when they rejoined the surviving members of their families.\r\n\r\nIn and about Fort Freeland, as a result of the attack 108 settlers were\r\nkilled or led away as prisoners of war, not by Indians, but by the\r\norganized militia of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nFifty-two women and children, and four old men, were permitted to depart\r\nfor Fort Augusta. Among the latter was John Vincent, who was permitted\r\nto care for his crippled wife. But Bethuel, Cornelius and Daniel Vincent\r\nwere taken prisoners. Among others taken to Canada, who also lived to\r\nreturn to their families, were Captain John Little, James Daugherty,\r\nMoses Kirk, James Durham, Samuel Gould and two of the Freelands.\r\n\r\nThe enemy ravaged the country in the vicinity of the fort and burned and\r\ndestroyed everything they could find. They advanced as far as Milton,\r\nwhere they burned Marcus Huling’s blacksmith shop, mill and dwelling\r\nhouse. The country presented a scene of desolation, and it remained in\r\nthis condition for several years, the settlers being afraid to return.\r\n\r\nThis heavy toll of human life, to which should also be added the killed\r\nand wounded among the British and their Indian allies, numbering\r\npossibly as many more, marks a definite battle of the Revolution; with\r\nthe magazines and stores at Fort Augusta and the cutting off of the rear\r\nof General Sullivan’s army, as the object of the attack.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 First Newspaper West of the Allegheny\r\n                 Mountains, the Gazette, of Pittsburgh,\r\n                       Established July 29, 1786\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first newspaper published west of the Allegheny Mountains was the\r\nPittsburgh Gazette which made its initial bow to the public, July 29,\r\n1786, and today, one hundred and thirty-eight years later, it is the\r\nlargest paper published in the world’s greatest industrial district.\r\n\r\nWhen the United States were yet very young, in fact, before the Federal\r\nConstitution was even proposed, before Washington was elected president,\r\nwhen the small cluster of log huts, protected by a stockade called Fort\r\nPitt, was all that constituted Pittsburgh, is the time this old\r\nnewspaper began its long and honorable career.\r\n\r\nEarly in the year 1786, John Scull and Joseph Hall rode into that\r\nwestern frontier post on the backs of heavy pack horses, over a long and\r\nrough trail, all the way from Philadelphia. They brought with them a\r\nsmall printing press, some type and a small supply of paper.\r\n\r\nThe pioneer printers established a printing office in a log cabin, along\r\nthe bank of the Monongahela River, at the end of Chancery Lane. This\r\nprimitive office soon attracted the attention of the more progressive\r\ncitizens, among whom was Hugh H. Brackenridge, a lawyer, and an\r\nacknowledged leader of the Federal party in that section of\r\nPennsylvania. Through his earnest solicitation and promise of patronage,\r\nScull and Hall determined to establish a weekly newspaper. Brackenridge\r\nhad agreed to edit the publication; and the first issue of the\r\nPittsburgh Gazette appeared July 29.\r\n\r\nThe original subscription price was seventeen shillings and six pence\r\nper year. Advertising was paid for at the rate of four shillings a\r\nsquare. In lieu of cash, the publishers made known the fact that they\r\nwould accept furs and skins and various kinds of country produce.\r\n\r\nThere was no postoffice in Pittsburgh at this time, nor for twenty years\r\nafter the Gazette was established. The paper found its way east by means\r\nof the weekly mail service between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. When\r\nPittsburgh was considered a place of sufficient importance to have a\r\npostoffice, John Scull, one of the publishers of the Gazette, was\r\nappointed Postmaster.\r\n\r\nIt is rather fortunate that the duties of the government position were\r\nnot too exacting, for Postmaster Scull was the practical printer and\r\nperformed the principal part of the actual publication. He even acted as\r\ncarrier and tramped about town each week with the paper.\r\n\r\nThe story is told of Scull that when the pack trains from Philadelphia\r\nfailed to arrive on time, or no white paper came when expected, that he\r\nused his close friendship for the commandant at Fort Pitt to his\r\nadvantage by borrowing sufficient quantity of cartridge paper on which\r\nto print that week’s issue of the Gazette.\r\n\r\nOn November 10, 1786, the Gazette, in three lines announced the death of\r\nJoseph Hall, aged 22 years. Hall’s interest was acquired by John Boyd,\r\nbut Scull as before, continued to be the real spirit behind the\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1789, a paper mill was built on Redstone Creek, in what is now\r\nFayette County, by Jackson and Sharpless. This mill supplied the Gazette\r\nwith cheaper paper, which enabled the owners to increase its size and\r\nreduce the subscription price to $2 a year.\r\n\r\nLawyer Brackenridge, in 1799, left the Federal party and threw all his\r\ninfluence with the Antifederalists, but Scull refused to go along with\r\nhis editor, and Morgan Neville became the editorial writer.\r\n\r\nBrackenridge and some of his adherents set up an opposition paper called\r\nthe “Tree of Life.” Soon both papers were busy with libel suits,\r\nassaults and challenges to fight duels.\r\n\r\nWhen the conflict of 1812 was precipitated the Gazette, like the other\r\nFederal organs, was adverse to war and urged a pacific settlement of\r\ndifficulties with England. But when the war broke the Gazette supported\r\nthe Federal Government with all its power. Its extra editions,\r\ncontaining the news brought in two days from Washington, were then\r\nlooked upon as “prodigious feats of journalism.”\r\n\r\nAfter full thirty years as the guiding spirit of the Gazette, August 1,\r\n1816, John Scull transferred his interest in the paper to his son, John\r\nI. Scull. The editor, Morgan Neville, also became a partner.\r\n\r\nEven with two other papers in Pittsburgh, the “Commonwealth” and the\r\n“Mercury,” the Gazette retained its leadership and now appeared\r\nsemi-weekly.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1820, Eichbaum and Johnson purchased the Gazette and changed\r\nits name to “The Gazette and Manufacturer and Mercantile Advertiser.”\r\nTwo years later David M. MacLean purchased the property and\r\nre-established the original title. In September, 1829, Neville B. Craig,\r\nbecame the owner and four years later the Gazette appeared as a daily.\r\nIt strongly supported the Anti-Masonic party. In September, 1856,\r\nRussell Errett, and D. L. Eaton became joint owners of the Gazette and\r\nunder their editorial management the paper made unusual progress.\r\n\r\nErrett was one of the organizers of the Republican party and the Gazette\r\nbecame one of the first organs of that party in the country.\r\n\r\nThere were several other changes in ownership until June 1, 1900, when\r\nthe late United States Senator George T. Oliver purchased the plant. May\r\n1, 1906, the Pittsburgh Times was absorbed and the title changed to The\r\nPittsburgh Gazette-Times.\r\n\r\nOn February 7, 1915, the Gazette-Times moved into the eight-story\r\npublication building on Gazette Square, where the paper is now\r\npublished.\r\n\r\nSince December 4, 1917, George S. Oliver has served as president and\r\nCharles W. Danziger, secretary and managing editor.\r\n\r\nEven as Pittsburgh has grown from a village of log houses when the\r\nGazette was established there, to one of the world’s most important\r\ncities, so the Gazette has evolved into one of the greatest newspapers\r\npublished in America.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             Chambersburg Sacked and Burned by McCausland’s\r\n                       Rebel Force July 30, 1864\r\n\r\n\r\nThree times during the Civil War the rebel horde rode into Pennsylvania,\r\nbut two occasions stand out as conspicuous. First when Lee, with nearly\r\n90,000 troops, in personal command, marched to his Waterloo at\r\nGettysburg, the other was when three thousand Confederates were sent by\r\nGeneral Early into Pennsylvania to burn Chambersburg in retaliation for\r\nGeneral Hunter’s disgraceful and disastrous raid into Virginia.\r\n\r\nGeneral Darius N. Couch was in command of the Union forces at\r\nChambersburg. Although a department he had but one hundred and fourteen\r\nmen under his command and they were scattered over the country as\r\nscouts.\r\n\r\nThe startling news came to General Couch’s headquarters on the evening\r\nof July 29, 1864, that a Confederate force had entered Mercersburg and\r\nwas marching toward Chambersburg. This was untimely news for less than\r\ntwenty-four hours earlier a sufficient number of troops had passed\r\nthrough Chambersburg on their way to join General Hunter, to have\r\nrepelled this rebel invasion.\r\n\r\nThe rebels reached the outskirts of Chambersburg before daylight, and\r\nemployed their time in planting two batteries in commanding positions,\r\nand getting up the whole column, fully three thousand strong.\r\n\r\nAt 6 o’clock Saturday morning they opened with their batteries and fired\r\nsix shots into the town. Immediately thereafter their skirmishers\r\nentered by almost every street and alley, and finding the way clear,\r\ntheir cavalry, to the number of 831, came in under the immediate command\r\nof General McCausland. General Bradley Johnson and the notorious Major\r\nHarry Gilmore were also with him.\r\n\r\nMcCausland and Gilmore demanded of the citizens, who were on the street,\r\nthat they collect some of the prominent inhabitants with a view of\r\nentering into negotiations; the court house bell was rung, but only a\r\nfew responded. To the few citizens who did come together, Captain\r\nFitzhugh, of McCausland’s staff, produced and read a written order,\r\nsigned by General Jubal Early, directing the command to proceed to\r\nChambersburg, to demand a tribute of $100,000 in gold or $500,000 in\r\ngreenbacks, and on failure to secure the sum, to proceed to burn the\r\ntown in retaliation of the burning of six or eight houses specified as\r\nhaving been burned in certain counties in Virginia, by General Hunter.\r\nHe was promptly answered that Chambersburg could not and would not pay\r\nthe ransom.\r\n\r\nInfuriated at the determination of the people to do nothing, Major\r\nGilmore rode up to a group of citizens, consisting of Thomas B. Kennedy,\r\nWilliam McLellan, J. McDowell Sharpe, Dr. J. C. Richards, William H.\r\nMcDowell, W. S. Everett, Edward G. Etter and M. A. Faltz, and ordered\r\nthem under arrest. He said that they would be held for the payment of\r\nthe money, and if not paid he would take them to Richmond as hostages\r\nand also burn every house in the town.\r\n\r\nWhile the officer was endeavoring to force them into an effort to raise\r\nthe money, his men commenced the work of firing, and they were liberated\r\nwhen it was found that intimidation would effect nothing.\r\n\r\nThe main part of the town was enveloped in flames in ten minutes. No\r\ntime was given to remove women or children, the aged and infirm, or\r\nsick, or even the dead. They divided into squads, beat down the doors,\r\nsmashed furniture, rifled drawers, appropriated money, jewelry, watches\r\nand valuables, then threw kerosene upon the combustible articles and\r\nplied the match. They invariably demanded ransom, before burning, but\r\neven when it was paid the property was burned. The people escaped with\r\nonly the clothes on their backs, and some even then with difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe work of demolition continued two hours, more than half the town on\r\nfire at once. Three million dollars worth of property was destroyed,\r\nthree thousand rendered homeless and many penniless, and not one of the\r\ninnocent victims had violated any accepted rule of civilized warfare.\r\n\r\nThere were many incidents of the burning but only a few can be related.\r\nThe house of James Watson, an old and feeble man past eighty, was\r\nentered, and because his wife remonstrated, they fired the room, hurled\r\nher into it and locked the door on the outside. Her daughters rescued\r\nher by bursting in the door before her clothing took fire. The widow of\r\na Union soldier, pleading on her knees, was robbed of her last ten\r\ndollars and her little home fired. An aged invalid, unable to be out of\r\nhis bed, pleaded to be spared a horrible death in the flames, but they\r\nlaughed at him as they fired his home. Father McCullom, the Catholic\r\npriest, was robbed of his watch.\r\n\r\nColonel Stumbaugh was arrested near his home early in the morning, and\r\nwith a pistol presented to his head ordered to procure some whiskey. He\r\nrefused, for he had none, and was released. But afterwards was\r\nrearrested by another squad, the officer of which referred to him by\r\nname, when he was insulted in every possible way. He informed the\r\nofficer that he had been in the service, and that if General Battles was\r\npresent, they would not dare to insult him. When asked why, he answered:\r\n“I captured him at Shiloh, and treated him like a soldier.” A rebel\r\nmajor present, who had been under Battles, upon inquiry, was satisfied\r\nthat Colonel Stumbaugh’s statement was correct, ordered his release and\r\nwithdrew the entire rebel force from that part of Second Street, and no\r\nbuildings were burned.\r\n\r\nSoon after the work of destruction had commenced, a squad was detailed\r\nto burn “Norland,” the beautiful residence of Colonel Alexander K.\r\nMcClure afterwards for many years the editor of the Philadelphia\r\n“Times.” “Norland” was a mile from the center of the town, and no other\r\nbuilding was fired within a half mile of it, although fifty houses\r\nintervened. They would not allow Mrs. McClure or any servant to save\r\nanything belonging to the Colonel.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the rebel thieves perpetrated their last pillage. Major\r\nBowen, of the 8th Virginia Cavalry, got too far ahead of the firing in\r\nhis greed for plunder and he was captured by several citizens and,\r\nslightly wounded, he took refuge in a burning cellar, where the intense\r\nheat blistered him. He begged to be spared, but he burned to death.\r\nAnother demon, caught in an atrocious act of vandalism, was shot dead. A\r\nCaptain Cochran, quartermaster of 11th Virginia Cavalry, was caught by\r\nThomas H. Doyle, of Loudon, and at the point of his pistol was given\r\njust fifteen minutes to live. Cochran begged piteously for his life, but\r\nDoyle, on the very second, shot the thief dead, and found on his person\r\n$815 in greenbacks, all stolen from citizens, and $1750 of rebel\r\ncurrency.\r\n\r\nScores of McCausland’s command were killed on the retreat by General\r\nAverill’s forces. Many of them were intoxicated and so demoralized by\r\ntheir plunder they became an easy prey to the Federal troops who passed\r\nthrough Chambersburg in pursuit of the barbarians.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Carlisle Indian School Established by\r\n                        Congress, July 31, 1882\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first non-reservation school established by the Government was at\r\nCarlisle, Pennsylvania, and was only recently discontinued.\r\n\r\nThis school had its inception in the untiring efforts of General R. H.\r\nPratt, U. S. A., when a lieutenant in charge of Indian prisoners of war\r\nat old Fort San Marco, St. Augustine, Florida, from May 11, 1875, to\r\nApril 14, 1878.\r\n\r\nWhen the release of these prisoners was ordered twenty-two of the young\r\nmen were led to ask for further education, agreeing to remain in the\r\neast three years longer if they could attend school. These were sent to\r\nHampton, Virginia, and several other places where they could attend a\r\ngovernment school.\r\n\r\nOn September 6, 1879, an order was issued transferring the Carlisle\r\nBarracks, Pennsylvania, comprising 27 acres, from the War Department to\r\nthe Department of the Interior for Indian school purposes, pending\r\naction by Congress on a bill to establish such an institution. This bill\r\nbecame a law July 31, 1882.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Pratt was, on September 6, 1879, ordered to report to the\r\nSecretary of the Interior, and by him was directed to proceed to\r\nCarlisle and there establish an Indian school. He was ordered to then\r\nproceed to Dakota and Indian territory for the purpose of obtaining\r\npupils for the new school. So successful was the young officer that by\r\nthe end of October, he had gathered together one hundred and thirty-six\r\nIndians from the Rosebud, Pine Ridge, and other agencies, and with\r\neleven of the former Florida prisoners, then at school at Hampton, the\r\nnew institution was opened at Carlisle Barracks, November 1, 1879, with\r\nan enrollment of one hundred and fifty-seven original Americans.\r\n\r\nThe school steadily progressed until more than a thousand pupils were\r\nenrolled and during its existence nearly every tribe in the United\r\nStates had representatives on its rolls and at one period one hundred\r\nAlaskan Indians were in attendance.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the school was to teach English and give a primary education;\r\nand a knowledge of some common and practical industry, and means of\r\nself-support among civilized people.\r\n\r\nTo this end regular shops and farms were provided, the principal\r\nmechanical arts and farming were taught the boys, and the girls,\r\ncooking, sewing, laundry and housework. The instruction was made\r\ninteresting so that the young Indians would not desire to return to\r\nreservation life, but would prefer to make for themselves a place among\r\nthe people of the East.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer vacation months, the young Indians would be placed in\r\nthe homes of prosperous citizens, where they could do certain work and\r\nat the same time learn by direct example and association the ways of\r\nhigher civilization. This was known as the “outing system,” and was a\r\ndistinct feature not only of the Carlisle school, but of the Indian\r\nschool service generally.\r\n\r\nThe literary curriculum of Carlisle stopped at that point where the\r\nstudent might enter the higher grades of the public schools. The pupil\r\nwas left to his own resources for any further development of his\r\nintellectual faculties.\r\n\r\nMany of the graduates of the Carlisle school are today filling\r\nresponsible positions in the business world, and especially in the\r\nIndian service, in which they are employed as teachers, clerks and all\r\nthe way to laborers.\r\n\r\nMany of the Indians are musical and the school band was one of the\r\nfeatures. The late Joel B. Ettinger, of Seattle, Wash., but formerly of\r\nChester, Pa., where he conducted the famous old Sixth Regiment Band,\r\norganized the first band from among the various tribes represented in\r\nthe school and soon developed a band which won the acclaim of the people\r\nwherever it played. Dennison and James Wheelock, Oneida Indians, became\r\ngreat leaders and succeeded Ettinger as instructors. The former was a\r\nsuccessful composer of band music.\r\n\r\nThe Carlisle school produced the first paper printed by Indian boys. The\r\nprintery was early established and became a potent factor in the\r\nindustrial development of the students. The Indian Helper, a small\r\nleaflet, was first produced, and afterwards a larger magazine, The Red\r\nMan, was published, these being merged into Red Man and Helper, and\r\ncreditably reflected the life and policies of the school.\r\n\r\nMany prominent writers and educators frequently contributed to this\r\nmagazine, thus helping the deserving wards of our government to make\r\ntheir effort a representative publication. Among those who sent valuable\r\ncontributions to this paper was Reverend George P. Donehoo, then\r\nsecretary of the Pennsylvania State Historical Society, late State\r\nLibrarian, and one of the most eminent authorities on Indian history in\r\nthe United States. The doctor is the proud possessor of a complete file\r\nof this valuable and interesting publication, which has become a very\r\nrare possession.\r\n\r\nThe physical training, both indoors and out, was a most important part\r\nof the life of the school. Indians take naturally to many of our popular\r\nsports, and many athletes of national and even international reputation\r\nhave been developed at the school. Most conspicuous of these is Jim\r\nThorpe, the world’s champion all-around athlete, winner of the\r\npentathlon event in the Olympic games; Chief Charles A. Bender, the\r\ncelebrated pitcher, a close second to Thorpe, while mention may also be\r\nmade of Hudson, the Pierce brothers, Johnson, Metoxen and many others\r\nwho have excelled above the average.\r\n\r\nGeneral Pratt remained in charge of the school from its organization\r\nuntil his retirement from the superintendency, June 30, 1904, when he\r\nwas succeeded by Major (then Captain) William A. Mercer, U. S. A.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                French and Indians Attack and Burn Fort\r\n                        Granville, August 1,1756\r\n\r\n\r\nFort Granville was about one mile west of the present town of Lewistown,\r\nimmediately on the north bank of the Juniata River and westward of the\r\nmouth of the Kishcoquillas Creek about one mile. There was a spring in\r\nthe enclosure of the fort which was destroyed when the canal was dug at\r\nthat place. No other evidences of this fort are seen today.\r\n\r\nThis was one of a chain of forts erected on the west side of the\r\nSusquehanna. Fort Shirley, at Aughwick, was fifteen miles southwest, and\r\nFort Patterson, at Mexico, was fifteen miles northeast.\r\n\r\nThe site commanded a narrow pass where the Juniata falls through the\r\nmountains; where a few men could hold it against a stronger enemy, as\r\nthe rocks were high on each bank and extended six miles, so that the\r\nenemy could be easily detected advancing from either direction.\r\n\r\nWhen the stockade was completed it was garrisoned by a company of\r\nenlisted men, under regularly commissioned officers. George Croghan, the\r\nIndian trader, was directed to build the fort as is shown by a letter\r\nwritten by Captain Elisha Salter, dated Carlisle, April 4, 1756.\r\n\r\nThe attack was made upon Fort Granville during the harvest of 1756. The\r\ngarrison at that time was commanded by Lieutenant Edward Armstrong,\r\nbrother of General John Armstrong, who destroyed Kittanning. The Indians\r\nhad been lurking about the stockade some time and knowing that the\r\ngarrison was not strong, sixty of them appeared before the fort, July\r\n22, and challenged the garrison to fight, which was declined by the\r\ncommander on account of the weakness of his force. The Indians fired at\r\none of the soldiers who was outside the stockade, but he succeeded in\r\ngetting safely inside.\r\n\r\nThe Indians divided their force into smaller parties, one attacked the\r\nBaskins plantation, near the Juniata, where they murdered Baskins,\r\nburned his house, and carried off his wife and children; another party\r\nmade Hugh Cornell and his family prisoners.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of July 30, Captain Edward Ward marched from Fort\r\nGranville, with a detachment destined for Tuscarora Valley, where they\r\nwere needed to protect the settlers while harvesting their grain. The\r\nfew remaining in defense of the post were commanded by Lieutenant\r\nArmstrong.\r\n\r\nSoon after the departure of Captain Ward’s detail, the fort was suddenly\r\nsurrounded by a hostile force of fifty French and a hundred Indians, who\r\nimmediately began a fierce attack, which they continued in their\r\nskulking Indian manner through the afternoon and night, but without\r\ninflicting much damage. About midnight the enemy got below the bank of\r\nthe river, and by a deep ravine reached to within twelve or fifteen\r\nyards of the fort, and from that secure position were able to set fire\r\nto the logs of the fort, burning out a large hole, through which the\r\nIndians fired on the defenders as they fought the flames. Lieutenant\r\nArmstrong and one private soldier were killed and three wounded.\r\n\r\nThe French commander ordered a suspension of hostilities, and demanded\r\nthe surrender of the fort and garrison, promising to spare their lives\r\nif the demands was accepted. Upon promise of quarter, a man named John\r\nTurner, previously a resident of Buffalo Valley, opened the gates and\r\nthe besiegers at once entered and took possession. There was no\r\ncommissioned officer to assume command and Turner acted on his own\r\ninitiative, as was afterwards explained by a prisoner who survived.\r\n\r\nThe French and Indians captured twenty-two men, three women and a number\r\nof children. The fort was then burned by Chief Jacobs, on the order of\r\nthe French officer in command. The prisoners were lined up and driven by\r\nthe Indians, each soldier carrying a heavy portion of the plunder\r\nsecured in the fort, and in the several raids made on the settlers’\r\nhomes.\r\n\r\nThe march to Kittanning was most terrible, the prisoners were horribly\r\nwhipped and punished when fatigue caused any to lag behind. When the\r\nparty arrived at Kittanning, all the prisoners were cruelly treated, and\r\nTurner, the man who opened the gates of the fort to the savages,\r\nsuffered the torture of being burned to death at the stake. He endured\r\nthe most horrible torment for more than three hours, during which time\r\nred hot gun barrels were forced through parts of his body, his scalp was\r\ntorn from his head and burning splinters of pine were stuck in his flesh\r\nuntil at last an Indian boy, who was held up for the purpose, sunk a\r\ntomahawk into his brain and released him from his misery.\r\n\r\nGeneral Armstrong in a letter sent to Governor Morris, dated at\r\nCarlisle, August 20, 1756, said: “Captains Armstrong and Ward, whom I\r\nordered on the march to Fort Shirley to examine everything at Fort\r\nGranville and send me a list of what remained among the ruins, assure me\r\nthat they found some parts of eight of the enemy burnt in two different\r\nplaces, and part of their shirts through which there were bullet holes.\r\nTo secrete these from the prisoners was doubtless the reason why the\r\nFrench officer marched our people some distance from the fort before he\r\ngave orders to burn the barracks, &c.\r\n\r\n“Walker says that some of the Germans flagged very much on the second\r\nday, and that the lieutenant (Armstrong) behaved with the greatest\r\nbravery to the last, despising all the terrors and threats of the enemy\r\nwhereby they often urged him to surrender. Though he had been near two\r\ndays without water, but little ammunition, the fort on fire, and the\r\nenemy situated within twelve or fourteen yards of the fort under the\r\nnatural bank, he was as far from yielding as when first attacked.\r\n\r\n“A Frenchman, in our service, fearful of being burned up, asked leave of\r\nthe lieutenant to treat with his countrymen in the French language. The\r\nLieutenant answered, 'The first word of French you speak in this\r\nengagement, I'll blow your brains out,' telling his men to hold out\r\nbravely, for the flame was falling and would soon have it extinguished,\r\nbut he soon after received the fatal ball.”\r\n\r\nThe destruction of Fort Granville spread terror among the settlers west\r\nof the Susquehanna and they abandoned their settlements and fled in\r\ngreat haste to Fort Augusta and Carlisle. This attack on Fort Granville\r\nresulted in the successful expedition of Col. John Armstrong against the\r\nIndians at Kittanning, where the English not only gained a signal\r\nvictory, but the savages were taught a lesson which they ever\r\nremembered.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Colonel Lochry Musters Westmoreland\r\n                      County Troops August 2, 1781\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1781, General George Rogers Clark, of Virginia, raised an expedition,\r\nostensibly to destroy the Indian towns of the Shawnee, Delaware, and\r\nWyandot, which were situated on the Scioto, Muskingum and Sandusky\r\nRivers, in what is now the State of Ohio, but his real and earnest\r\npurpose was the reduction of the British post at Detroit, and the\r\nwinning by conquest of another empire for the Dominion of Virginia.\r\n\r\nAt this time Virginia claimed ownership to that part of Pennsylvania,\r\nwhich laid west of the Laurel Hill range including what is now Fayette,\r\nWestmoreland, Green, Washington, Allegheny and part of Beaver Counties.\r\nIn spite of the fact that the boundary line had been settled in 1779,\r\nmany of the inhabitants and officials still acknowledged allegiance to\r\nthe Old Dominion.\r\n\r\nA force of volunteers to the number of one hundred was raised in\r\nWestmoreland County and placed under the command of that intrepid\r\nsoldier, Colonel Archibald Lochry.\r\n\r\nColonel Lochry’s command was composed of a company raised and commanded\r\nby Captain Thomas Stokely, another under Captain Samuel Shannon; a small\r\ncompany of riflemen under Captain Robert Orr, was raised in Hannastown,\r\nnow Greensburg; and Captain William Campbell commanded a squad of\r\nhorsemen.\r\n\r\nThe men recruited for this service remained on their settlements until\r\nharvest was finished in July, and on August 1, rendezvoused at\r\nCarnaghan’s blockhouse, eleven miles northwest of Hannastown. Here they\r\nmustered August 2, and on the following day Colonel Lochry began his\r\nmarch to join General Clark at Wheeling.\r\n\r\nThe determined little band crossed the Youghiogheny at the site of West\r\nNewton, then crossed the Monongahela at Devore’s Ferry, where\r\nMonongahela City now stands; went overland by the settlements on the\r\nheadwaters of Chartiers and Raccoon Creeks, and reached Fort Henry in\r\nthe evening of Wednesday, August 8.\r\n\r\nHere was a disappointment. General Clark had left by boats early that\r\nmorning, and he left a message that he would wait for Colonel Lochry at\r\nthe mouth of Little Kanawha. But no boats were provided for Lochry’s\r\ncommand, and he waited at Wheeling four days, while seven boats were\r\nbeing built, but these four days were fatal.\r\n\r\nOn August 13, Colonel Lochry embarked in the seven boats, the horses\r\nfollowing along the shores of the river. At this time the Ohio was the\r\ndividing line between the white man’s country and that of the Indians.\r\nThe boats kept near the southern shore and all encampments were made on\r\nthe left bank. Although Colonel Lochry did not know it, his men and\r\ntheir movements were watched by Indian spies who followed them through\r\nthe forests and thickets on the opposite shore of the Ohio.\r\n\r\nColonel Lochry met seventeen men at Fishing Creek, who had deserted from\r\nClark, who were making their way back to Fort Pitt. These he forced to\r\njoin his party. At the Three Islands, Lochry found Major Charles\r\nCrascraft and six men who had been left by Clark in charge of a large\r\nhouse boat, intended for Lochry’s horses, which were put aboard, and\r\nthis enabled the force to move with increased speed.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, August 16, Colonel Lochry sent Captain Shannon and\r\nseven men in a small boat to endeavor to overtake Clark and beg him to\r\nleave some provisions for his command. Lochry’s flour was about\r\nexhausted, and food could only be secured by sending out hunters, whose\r\nexcursions delayed progress. On August 17, the two men sent out for food\r\nfailed to return, and were never heard from again.\r\n\r\nThree days later two of Captain Shannon’s men, half starved, were picked\r\nup from the southern shore. They told the story of the first disaster to\r\nLochry’s command. This little detail had landed on the Kentucky shore to\r\nprepare a meal and the two survivors, with a sergeant, had gone off to\r\nhunt. When they had gone a half mile into the woods, they heard the\r\nfiring of guns in the direction of their camp. Fearing Indians had\r\nattacked the rest of Captain Shannon’s little party, these three were\r\nafraid to return to investigate and started to join Lochry. In\r\nscrambling through the thick underbrush the sergeant’s knife fell from\r\nits sheath, and, sticking point upward, the sergeant trod upon it, the\r\nblade passing through his foot, and the young man died in great agony in\r\na few hours.\r\n\r\nThe expedition suffered not only the death of Captain Shannon and his\r\nmen but the Indians captured the letter from Colonel Lochry to General\r\nClark, revealing the distressed condition of his men, through which\r\ninformation their doom was sealed.\r\n\r\nLochry now realized that his movement down the stream was being watched\r\nby the savages from both shores, and for two days and nights no landing\r\nor halt was made. The little flotilla glided swiftly down the stream,\r\nuntil necessity compelled landing, to graze the horses and seek meat for\r\nthe men.\r\n\r\nThe boats approached the mouth of a small creek, in the forenoon of\r\nAugust 24. This creek has since been called Lochry’s Run. A buffalo was\r\ndrinking at the river’s edge and a soldier brought it down, when Colonel\r\nLochry ordered a landing, for here was meat and fine grass for the\r\nhorses.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had a landing been made than a hundred rifles cracked from the\r\nwooded bank, many white men were killed and many wounded.\r\n\r\nThe men made for the boats and shoved off for the opposite shore.\r\nPainted savages then appeared, shrieking and firing, and a fleet of\r\ncanoes filled with other savages shot out from the Kentucky shore,\r\ncompletely cutting off the escape of Lochry’s men. The volunteers\r\nreturned the fire for a few moments, but were entrapped, and Colonel\r\nLochry offered to surrender. The fight ceased, the boats poled back to\r\nshore and the force again landed.\r\n\r\nThe Westmorelanders found themselves the prisoners of Joseph Brant, the\r\nmost famous Mohawk Chief, who commanded a large force of Iroquois,\r\nShawnee and Wyandot. George Girty, brother of the notorious Simon, also\r\ncommanded an Indian force. The Shawnee could not be controlled and\r\nkilled the prisoners they claimed as their share. While Colonel Lochry\r\nwas sitting on a log a Shawnee warrior slipped up behind him and sank a\r\ntomahawk into his skull, tearing off his scalp before life was extinct.\r\nIt was with great difficulty Brant was able to prevent the massacre of\r\nthe men assigned to the Mohawk and Wyandot.\r\n\r\nIn this massacre forty Westmoreland volunteers were slain, and\r\nsixty-four taken captives. Among those who escaped death were Captains\r\nStokely and Orr, the latter being severely wounded. The dead were left\r\nunburied and the prisoners hurried away to Detroit, where most of them\r\nwere turned over to the British, and afterward transferred to Montreal.\r\nOnly nineteen of the men ever returned to Westmoreland County.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Civil Government in Pennsylvania Established\r\n                         at Meeting of Council\r\n                             August 3, 1681\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen William Penn was granted the charter for Pennsylvania, he and his\r\nheirs were constituted the true and absolute Proprietary of the country.\r\nPenn was empowered to establish laws, appoint officers, and to do other\r\nacts and things necessary to govern the country, including the right to\r\nerect manors.\r\n\r\nThe first act of William Penn was to write a letter to the inhabitants\r\nof Pennsylvania, dated April 8, 1681. Two days later he appointed his\r\ncousin Captain William Markham deputy governor and commander-in-chief of\r\nthe province, whom he clothed with full powers to put the machinery of\r\nthe new government into motion.\r\n\r\nAt what time Captain Markham sailed for America is not known, but we\r\nfind him in New York, with the King’s letter in June, which, with his\r\ncommission, he laid before the council and commander in the absence of\r\nGovernor Andros.\r\n\r\nOn June 21, the authorities at New York addressed a letter to the\r\njustice and other magistrates on the Delaware notifying them of the\r\nchange of government.\r\n\r\nMarkham departed from New York a few days later and repaired to\r\nPennsylvania to enter upon his duties, bearing with him Penn’s letter to\r\nthe inhabitants, which assured them that they should be governed by laws\r\nof their own making, and would receive the most ample protection to\r\nperson and property.\r\n\r\nMarkham was authorized to call a council of nine, which met and\r\norganized August 3, from which time we may date the establishment of a\r\ncivil government in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThere was very little interference in the established order of things,\r\nand the people found a mild ruler in the deputy governor.\r\n\r\nThe seat of government was fixed at Upland, the present Chester. The old\r\ncourt closed its session September 13, and the new court opened the next\r\nday.\r\n\r\nAmong the business transacted at the opening of the new court was the\r\nappointment of William Biles and Robert Lucas, who lived at the falls,\r\njustices of the peace. Pounds, shillings, and pence were declared to be\r\nthe currency of the country. But it was difficult to get rid of the\r\nguilders after they had been so long in circulation.\r\n\r\nMarkham was instructed by William Penn to select a site, and build for\r\nhim a dwelling, and he chose the spot whereon Pennsbury house was\r\nerected, in Falls Township, Bucks County.\r\n\r\nOn September 30, William Penn appointed William Crispin, John Bezar, and\r\nChristopher Allen, commissioners, to go to Pennsylvania with power to\r\npurchase land of the Indians and to select site for, and lay out a great\r\ncity. About this same time he appointed James Harrison his “lawful\r\nagent,” to sell for him any parcel of land in Pennsylvania of not less\r\nthan 250 acres.\r\n\r\nSilas Crispen was appointed surveyor-general, and sailed with this\r\ncommission but, dying on the voyage, Captain Thomas Holme was appointed\r\nin his place and commissioned April 18, 1682.\r\n\r\nAmong the earliest acts of Markham and the commissioners was the\r\nselection of a site for a great city, which resulted in the founding of\r\nPhiladelphia. Soundings along the west side of the Delaware River were\r\nmade to ascertain “where most ships may best ride of deepest draft of\r\nwater.”\r\n\r\nThe growth of the new “city” was remarkable from its very inception.\r\nWithin a few months Philadelphia contained eighty houses, and more than\r\n300 farms were laid out and partly cleared.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1684 the city contained 357 houses, many of them large\r\nand well-built, with cellars. A year later the number of houses had\r\nincreased to 600. There were nearly 3000 souls in the city at this time.\r\n\r\nWilliam Penn sailed for Pennsylvania in the ship Welcome, of 300 tons\r\nburden, Captain Robert Greenway, September 1, 1682, accompanied by 100\r\nemigrants, mostly Friends.\r\n\r\nHe first landed at New Castle October 27, and then at Upland on the\r\n29th. On November 9, Penn visited Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nPenn was very favorably impressed with virgin Pennsylvania. Pastorius\r\nwrites that Penn found the air so perfumed that it seemed to him like an\r\norchard in full bloom; that the trees and shrubs were everywhere covered\r\nwith leaves, and filled with birds, which, by their beautiful colors and\r\ndelightful notes proclaimed the praise of their Creator.\r\n\r\nPenn’s policy from the beginning of his province was to extinguish the\r\nIndian title to his grant of Pennsylvania by purchase. This he did in\r\nfact, and the several treaty purchases made by him were executed fairly\r\nand honorably.\r\n\r\nAt the first provincial assembly held at Philadelphia, in March, 1683, a\r\nnumber of acts were passed necessary to put Penn’s government in\r\noperation. The country was divided into three counties, Philadelphia,\r\nChester, and Bucks, and their boundaries fixed. A house of correction\r\nwas ordered for each county, 24 x 16 feet, in size.\r\n\r\nThe poor, who received relief from the county, with their families, were\r\nobliged to wear the letter P made of red or blue cloth, with the first\r\nletter of the name of the place they inhabited, in a conspicuous place\r\nupon the shoulder of the right sleeve.\r\n\r\nThe county court was authorized to fix a price on linen and woolen\r\ncloth, justices were to regulate wages of servants and women; a meal of\r\nvictuals was fixed at seven pence half-penny, and beer at a penny a\r\nquart.\r\n\r\nThe products of the farms were to be received in payment of debts. Each\r\nsettler of three years was to sow a bushel of barley, and persons were\r\nto be punished who put water in rum.\r\n\r\nThe civil government as established August 3, 1681, was soon\r\nfunctioning.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Saturday Evening Post Launched from\r\n                        Gazette, August 4, 1821\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his excellent and interesting “A Man from Maine,” Edward W. Bok\r\ndevotes a chapter to the story of the purchase and development of The\r\nSaturday Evening Post by Cyrus H. K. Curtis. This chapter is styled “The\r\nStory of the 'Singed Cat.'”\r\n\r\nMr. Curtis was born in Portland, Maine, June 18, 1850. He went to\r\nPhiladelphia in 1876, and seven years later started The Ladies’ Home\r\nJournal.\r\n\r\nMr. Curtis first developed the Ladies Home Journal and then turned his\r\nenergy and wonderful organization to a magazine for men.\r\n\r\nSomehow he fixed his mind upon The Saturday Evening Post as the medium\r\nthrough which he was to realize his pet dream. Mr. Bok is authority for\r\nthe statement that Mr. Curtis himself does not remember how he came to\r\nfix up this old paper, but says that the publication had always\r\nattracted him as he met it each week in his exchanges as a legacy left\r\nto Philadelphia by Benjamin Franklin, who, in 1728, founded the paper\r\nunder the title of The Pennsylvania Gazette.\r\n\r\nFranklin edited and published this paper for a number of years, and then\r\nsold it to his grandson. Meanwhile six other papers of all sorts had\r\nbeen born in Philadelphia, all having as part of their title the word\r\nGazette. So in 1821, to avoid a constant confusion of names, the name\r\nwas changed to The Saturday Evening Post, August 4, 1821.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of enterprise of that early day must have been put into the\r\nventure, for in 1839, it had a circulation of thirty-five thousand\r\ncopies, the largest circulation of that day of any weekly in the United\r\nStates. The most famous statesmen and writers of the time were among its\r\ncontributors, and it ranked as the most important publication of the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe Saturday Evening Post, like other old newspapers, frequently passed\r\ninto various ownerships, nearly all of whom were Philadelphians, but a\r\nresident of Brooklyn, N. Y., owned it for a time, although the place of\r\npublication remained at Philadelphia, and finally it passed into the\r\npossession of Albert Smyth, of Philadelphia, whose publication it was\r\nwhen Mr. Curtis went to Philadelphia in 1876, to begin the career which\r\nhas made him the most successful and most beloved of all publishers in\r\nall the world.\r\n\r\nDuring the time that Philadelphia was in possession of the British,\r\nunder Lord Howe, the publication was suspended, but after the last\r\nBritish “Tommy” marched away, the paper was revived and from that time\r\nto this day it has never missed an issue. With this record of over a\r\ncentury Mr. Smyth was justly proud and its ownership was a matter of\r\npride, as well as the distinguished record of long service. He was fond\r\nof its history and tradition, and as he and Mr. Curtis were friends, it\r\nis not improbable that the latter’s interest in this old paper was\r\nfostered during these chats, and he began a little search on his own\r\naccount for the intimate history of the paper, and before long, Mr.\r\nCurtis knew quite as much about it as did its proud owner.\r\n\r\nYet the paper was losing out, the circulation was steadily and surely\r\ndiminishing, no one seemed to care. The editorship was entrusted to a\r\nreporter of the Philadelphia Times, who devoted his odd moments upon The\r\nSaturday Evening Post, at the elegant salary of ten dollars a week, and\r\nthe articles published were just what a ten dollar editor would be\r\nexpected to use.\r\n\r\nA man with the vision and patriotism of Mr. Curtis could not help\r\nfeeling regret that a paper with such traditions was allowed to run\r\ndown, and he began to bargain with Mr. Smyth.\r\n\r\nTrue it was only a name, but it had a long history and valuable\r\nheritage. Best of all, Benjamin Franklin had founded it, and that was an\r\nasset upon which Mr. Curtis could build.\r\n\r\nMr. Smyth went to Chicago, where he was interested in a gas project, and\r\nleft The Saturday Evening Post in charge of a friend named Brady, but in\r\n1897 Smyth died, leaving a sister as his only heir. She could not or\r\nwould not finance the publication, and Brady turned to Mr. Curtis for\r\nthe money to get out that week’s issue.\r\n\r\nTo Brady’s surprise Mr. Curtis told him that the name of the paper was\r\nnot protected with a copyright, and that if the sister did not put up\r\nthe money and an issue was missed anyone could take up the name.\r\n\r\nBrady’s lawyer confirmed the statement. Mr. Curtis said he would not do\r\nanything like that, but told Brady he had nothing to sell. “However,\r\nI'll give you one thousand dollars for the paper, type and all.”\r\n\r\nMr. Curtis became the owner of the paper, and sent a young man in his\r\nestablishment with a wagon to the printing office to bring away the\r\nbattered type, and as soon as it arrived, that week’s issue was printed,\r\nso as to save the right to the title by continuous publication.\r\n\r\nAt this time the subscription list was about two thousand and soon as\r\nMr. Curtis improved the paper these few subscribers cancelled their\r\nsubscriptions, when it was learned that the new owner had in fact\r\npurchased only the title and name of Benjamin Franklin.\r\n\r\nThe outlook for the future for this new venture was so gloomy that men\r\nin his employ called it “the singed cat.”\r\n\r\nMr. Curtis selected George Horace Lorimer, of Boston, as the editor and\r\nhe got behind him, even in the face of the most discouraging criticism,\r\nbut neither Mr. Curtis nor Mr. Lorimer ever for a single moment doubted\r\nthat the project would make good. A half million dollars were spent upon\r\nadvertising the periodical, and at one time the loss totalled nearly a\r\nmillion dollars, but during all this period there was being developed\r\njust the kind of a paper that Mr. Curtis wanted The Saturday Evening\r\nPost to be.\r\n\r\nThen the circulation grew and when it reached five hundred thousand\r\ncopies the advertisers began to use its pages, and Mr. Curtis had now\r\nput into the paper a million and a quarter dollars. Then the paper\r\nappeared with a “circulation of one million copies” printed on the\r\ncover, and the fight was won.\r\n\r\nThe circulation is now in excess of two million, and is, without a\r\ndoubt, the greatest publication in the history of journalism.\r\n\r\nThe Curtis Publishing Company publish The Ladies Home Journal, The\r\nSaturday Evening Post, The Country Gentleman, The Public Ledger and The\r\nEvening Public Ledger and the output of this plant is six hundred and\r\nfifty thousand complete magazines, each working day, and all this in\r\naddition to seventy-three million newspapers each year.\r\n\r\nMore than one hundred railroad cars each month are required to circulate\r\nthe magazines, as the Ladies Home Journal goes to one out of every ten\r\nwomen in the United States and The Saturday Evening Post goes into more\r\nthan one out of every ten homes in this country. Such is the story of\r\nnot only Pennsylvania’s oldest and best magazine, but the largest and\r\nmost successful in the world.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Patrick Gordon, Administrator of Penn’s\r\n                       Will, Died August 5, 1736\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Penn was financially involved when stricken and during the six\r\nyears he suffered until relieved by death, July 30, 1718, did not place\r\nhis affairs in more favorable condition.\r\n\r\nThe Province of Pennsylvania was encumbered by Proprietary’s mortgage\r\ngiven in 1708, and by his contract with the Crown for the sale of the\r\ngovernment. His will, which was drawn in 1712, was in contemplation of\r\nthis contract.\r\n\r\nTo his only surviving son, William, by his first marriage, he bequeathed\r\nall his estates in England and Ireland, which, producing fifteen hundred\r\npounds sterling per annum, were estimated of greater value than his\r\nAmerican possessions.\r\n\r\nBy his first wife, Gulielma Maria Springett, he had issue of three sons,\r\nWilliam, Springett and William, and four daughters, Gulielma, Margaret,\r\nGulielma and Letitia. From his American possession he made provision for\r\nthe payment of his debts, and for his widow, Hannah Callowhill and four\r\nsons, John, Thomas, Richard and Dennis. To his wife, Hannah, whom he\r\nmade the sole executrix of his estate, he gave for the equal benefit of\r\nherself and her children, all his personal estate in Pennsylvania and\r\nelsewhere, after paying all debts, and allotting ten thousand acres of\r\nland in the Province to his daughter Letitia, by his first marriage, and\r\neach of the three children of his son William, and to convey the\r\nremainder at the discretion of his widow, to her children, subject to an\r\nannuity to herself of £300 sterling per annum.\r\n\r\nDoubts having arisen as to the force of the provisions of this will, it\r\nwas finally determined to institute a suit in chancery for its\r\ndetermination. Before a decision was reached in March, 1720, William\r\nPenn, Jr., died, and while it was still pending, his son, Springett,\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nDuring the more than nine years of litigation, Hannah Penn, as executrix\r\nof the will, assumed the Proprietary power, issued instructions to her\r\nLieutenant-Governor, heard complaints and settled differences with the\r\nskill and assurance of a veteran diplomat. In 1727 a decision was\r\nreached that, upon the death of William Penn, Jr., and his son\r\nSpringett, the proprietary rights in Pennsylvania descended to the three\r\nsurviving sons, John, Thomas and Richard, issue by the second marriage.\r\n\r\nThe Province now entered upon a period of great prosperity. The almost\r\nunbounded confidence of the Province in Governor Keith enabled him, in\r\n1720, to establish two measures hitherto repugnant to the Assembly, and\r\nequity court, dependent on the Governor’s will, of which he was\r\nchancellor, and a militia organized by like authority.\r\n\r\nThe great influx of foreigners alarmed the Assembly, who feared their\r\nsettlement on the frontier. Attempts to naturalize them were treated\r\nwith coldness. Even the Governor, whose industry and utility were\r\nproverbial, could not remove the jealousy.\r\n\r\nMany Palatines, long resident in the Province, applied for\r\nnaturalization in 1721, but not until 1724 was leave granted to bring in\r\na bill, and then conditioned upon the proviso that they should\r\nindividually obtain from the justice of the peace a certificate of the\r\nvalue of their property, and nature of their religious faith. A bill to\r\nthat effect reached the Governor the following year, but he returned it\r\non the ground that in a country where English liberty and law prevailed,\r\na scrutiny into the private conversation and faith of the citizens, and\r\nparticularly into their estates, was unjust and dangerous in precedent.\r\nThe House yielded, but it was not for some time that the privilege of\r\nsubjects were granted to the Palatines.\r\n\r\nFollowing the death of Springett Penn and Mrs. Hannah Penn, the Assembly\r\nconceived that the authority of Governor Patrick Gordon was determined,\r\nand accordingly refused to act upon a message which he had sent them,\r\nand adjourned themselves to the last day of their term.\r\n\r\nA new commission, signed by John, Thomas and Richard Penn, in whom the\r\ngovernment was now vested, was received by Governor Gordon in October.\r\nWhen the King gave his approbation to this new commission he reserved as\r\nthe right of the Crown, the government of the Lower Counties on the\r\nDelaware.\r\n\r\nPatrick Gordon who served as Deputy Governor from July 26, 1726, to his\r\ndeath had been a soldier in the regular army, serving from his youth to\r\nnear the close of Queen Anne’s reign, with a high reputation. He was\r\nappointed successor of Governor Keith by the family, and formally\r\nproposed to the Crown by Springett Penn, their heir-at-law.\r\n\r\nHe arrived in the Province with his family in the summer of 1726, and\r\nmet the Assembly during the first week of August. In his first address\r\nhe alluded to the fact of his having been a soldier, that he\r\nconsequently knew nothing of the crooked ways of professed politicians\r\nand must rely upon a blunt, straightforward course in his communications\r\nwith them in his administration of the government. His whole public\r\ncareer seems to have been characterized by this same frankness and\r\nintegrity.\r\n\r\nGovernor Gordon took prompt measures to apprehend and punish worthless\r\ndrunken Indians who committed outrages. He concluded several very\r\nimportant treaties with the Six Nations, and attended these in person.\r\nHe published “Two Indians Treaties at Conestogoe,” in 1728.\r\n\r\nGovernor Gordon died August 5, 1736. His administration was in all\r\nrespects a happy one. The unanimity of the Assembly, the Council and the\r\nGovernor, gave an uninterrupted course to the prosperity of the\r\nProvince. The wisdom which guided her counsels was strongly portrayed in\r\nher internal peace, increased population, improved morals and thriving\r\ncommerce. The death of Governor Gordon was equally lamented by the\r\nProprietaries and the people.\r\n\r\nUpon the death of Governor Gordon, the administration of the government\r\nagain devolved on the Council, of which James Logan was president. He so\r\ngoverned until August, 1738, when Sir George Thomas, a wealthy planter,\r\nof the island of Antigua, was appointed by the Proprietaries. Governor\r\nThomas immediately devoted his energies toward the settlement of the\r\nboundary dispute, by which it was mutually agreed, that matters should\r\nrest along the border, until final settlement of the boundary lines.\r\n\r\nThe famous “Indian Walk” was performed by Edward Marshall, and others on\r\nSeptember 19, 1737. This walk, according to Charles Thomson, was the\r\ncause of jealousies and heart burnings among the Indians, which\r\neventually broke out in loud complaints of injustice and atrocious acts\r\nof savage vengeance. The very first murder committed by them after this\r\ndeception was on the very land from which they believed themselves\r\ncheated.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Colonel Bouquet Defeats Indians by Stratagem\r\n                      at Bushy Run, August 6, 1763\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1763 the savages, angered by the losses of the French and by finding\r\nthe English settlers pressing upon them, organized what has been called\r\na conspiracy under Pontiac. It nearly succeeded and many English forts\r\nwere captured.\r\n\r\nIn Pennsylvania there were many murders and burnings all around Forts\r\nPitt, Le Boeuf, Presque Isle and Ligonier; many were killed at Bedford\r\nand Carlisle, and even Fort Augusta, on the Susquehanna at Sunbury, was\r\nseriously threatened.\r\n\r\nColonel Henry Bouquet, an energetic and capable officer, took a\r\nbattalion of the Royal American Regiment and two companies of\r\nHighlanders and English and started from Philadelphia for Fort Pitt.\r\n\r\nUpon his arrival he found Carlisle crowded with fugitives, and learned\r\nthat Presque Isle, Le Boeuf and Venango, now English forts, had fallen.\r\nHomes were burning all through the neighboring valleys.\r\n\r\nWith five hundred men Bouquet pushed over the mountain to Bedford and\r\nFort Ligonier, which he relieved from a siege just in time. At Bedford\r\nthirty hunters with rifles joined him. He heard from Fort Pitt that the\r\ncommander and nine others had been wounded.\r\n\r\nBouquet resolved to leave behind the oxen and wagons, which formed the\r\nmost cumbersome part of the convoy. Thus relieved, the army resumed its\r\nmarch August 4, taking with them 350 pack horses and a few cattle, and\r\nat nightfall encamped at no great distance from Ligonier.\r\n\r\nWithin less than a day’s march lay the dangerous defiles of Turtle\r\nCreek. Fearing that the enemy would lay in ambuscade at this place,\r\nBouquet determined to march on the following day as far as a small\r\nstream called Bushy Run, to rest there until night and then, by a forced\r\nmarch, to cross Turtle Creek under cover of the darkness.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of August 5, the tents were struck at an early hour, and\r\nthe troops began their march through a rough country, everywhere covered\r\nwith a tall, dense forest.\r\n\r\nBy noon they had advanced to within less than a mile of Bushy Run.\r\nSuddenly the report of rifles from the front sent a thrill along the\r\nranks. The firing became terrific, while the shouts and whoops showed\r\nthat the advance guard was hotly engaged. The two foremost companies\r\nwere sent to support it, but far from abating, the fire grew so furious\r\nthat it revealed the presence of an enemy at once numerous and resolute.\r\n\r\nThe convoy was halted, the troops formed into line, and a general charge\r\nordered. Bearing down through the forest with fixed bayonets, they drove\r\nthe yelping savages before them, and swept the ground clear.\r\n\r\nAt this very moment of success, a fresh burst of whoops and firing was\r\nheard from either flank, while noise from the rear showed that the\r\nconvoy was attacked. The column fell back for its support, drove off the\r\nassailants, and formed in a circle around the terrified horses. No man\r\nlost his composure, but each displayed implicit confidence in their\r\ncommander.\r\n\r\nNow ensued a combat most discouraging. Again and again, now one side and\r\nnow on the other, a crowd of Indians rushed up, pouring in a heavy fire,\r\nin their effort to break into the circle. A well directed volley met\r\nthem, followed by a charge of the bayonet. The Indians fled behind\r\ntrees, few of them were hurt, while the English suffered severely.\r\n\r\nThus the fight went on without intermission for seven hours, until\r\napproaching night, when the Indian fire slackened, and the exhausted\r\nsoldiers found time to rest.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to change their ground in the enemy’s presence, and\r\nthe troops were obliged to encamp where the combat had taken place,\r\nthough not a drop of water was to be found there.\r\n\r\nBouquet, doubtful of surviving the battle of the morrow, wrote to Sir\r\nJeffrey Amherst, in a few, clear, concise words, an account of the day’s\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the troops was deplorable. About sixty soldiers,\r\nbesides several officers, had been killed or disabled. A space in the\r\ncenter of the camp was prepared for the care of the wounded, and\r\nsurrounded by a wall built of bags of flour. Here they lay upon the\r\nground, enduring agonies of thirst, as well as of pain.\r\n\r\nThe situation of those who hitherto escaped was not an enviable one. In\r\nevent of defeat, a fate inexpressibly horrible waited them, while even\r\nvictory did not assure their safety, since so many wounded comrades made\r\nit difficult to transport them. On the other side the enemy were\r\nexulting in the fullest confidence of success.\r\n\r\nWith the earliest dawn of day there broke out a general burst of those\r\nhorrid yells which form the prelude of an Indian battle. Instantly from\r\nevery side the fire poured in with deadly aim.\r\n\r\nAt each furious rush the savages were repulsed. The English, maddened\r\nmore by the torments of thirst than the fire of the enemy, fought\r\nfuriously. But the enemy saw their distress and pressed them closer and\r\nmore desperately.\r\n\r\nThe center of the camp was all confusion. The horses broke away a dozen\r\nat a time and stampeded through the wounded troops. At ten o’clock the\r\ncircle was yet unbroken, but there had been many killed. If the day was\r\nto be saved, the effort must be made at once and Bouquet was equal to\r\nthe emergency.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the confusion he conceived a masterly stratagem. Could\r\nthe Indians be brought together in a body and made to stand their\r\nground, there could be little doubt of the result. Bouquet instructed\r\nthe men who were in the most exposed place to give way. The Indians\r\nmistook this movement for a retreat. Confident that their victory was\r\nsure, they leaped up on all sides and rushed headlong towards the spot.\r\n\r\nHere they found themselves between two deadly fires and with the reserve\r\ntroops blocking their retreat they were utterly routed. The Highlanders,\r\nwith yells as wild as their own, fell on them with bayonet. The shock\r\nwas irresistible and they fled before the charging ranks, not a living\r\nIndian remained near the spot. Among the dead were found several\r\nprominent chiefs.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Bushy Run was the best contested battle ever fought\r\nbetween white men and Indians. It was the most serious defeat ever\r\ninflicted upon the savages down to that time.\r\n\r\nWith the loss of eight officers and 115 men, Bouquet reached Fort Pitt\r\nAugust 10. It was a joyous moment both to the troops and the garrison,\r\nwhich had been surrounded and hotly pressed by the Indians since July\r\n28.\r\n\r\nThe next year Bouquet led an expedition beyond the Ohio, but the Indians\r\nsued for peace and he compelled them to bring all their captives to Fort\r\nPitt, where their friends could identify them.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Indian Council Between Governor Denny\r\n                     and Tedyuskung Ended at Easton\r\n                             August 7, 1757\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fact that the great Delaware King Tedyuskung was not present at the\r\nimportant council at Lancaster in April, 1757, caused much more concern\r\nin the Provincial Government than is usually the case when one person of\r\nimportance fails to attend. The Delaware Indians were still chafing\r\nunder the rebuke they received at the hands of Canassetoga, the great\r\nOnondaga Chief Sachem, and the Six Nations, who ordered them from the\r\nlands at the Forks of the Delaware River to the Wyoming and Shamokin\r\nValleys.\r\n\r\nSoon as the Lancaster council was concluded, messengers were dispatched\r\nto Tedyuskung and to the Seneca and Shawnee, inviting them to hold a\r\ntreaty with the English.\r\n\r\nOn June 16, Sir Wm. Johnson held a general conference with the Onondaga,\r\nCayuga and Seneca, of the Six Nations, at his estate “Fort Johnson,” in\r\nwhich he strongly urged these tribes to come to the support of the\r\nEnglish in their warfare against the French. He severely censured\r\nTedyuskung and the Seneca for their conduct.\r\n\r\nThe Indian messengers, Nathanial and Zacharias, failed to find\r\nTedyuskung at Wyoming, and journeyed to the Seneca villages in New York\r\nwhere they found the King and delivered the Governor’s message.\r\nTedyuskung and the messengers immediately set out for Pennsylvania, and\r\non their way met Joe Peepy, Shikellamy’s son, and Tapescawen, the two\r\nmessengers sent out by the Lancaster Council in quest of Tedyuskung.\r\nNathanial and Zacharias hastened on to advise the Governor that\r\nTedyuskung and his followers would set out from Tioga for Easton the\r\nmiddle of June.\r\n\r\nTedyuskung and his retinue arrived at Fort Allen July 3, 200 strong and\r\nwaited there for the arrival of 100 Seneca. On July 8, 155 men, women\r\nand children followed Tedyuskung out of Fort Allen toward Easton, and a\r\nfew days later 117 Seneca and other Six Nations’ Indians arrived at\r\nEaston, via Wyoming; among the Seneca delegation were old King Nutimus\r\nand “French Margaret.”\r\n\r\nGovernor Denny, accompanied by members of the Council, Board of Indian\r\nCommissioners and a large number of citizens, including many Quakers,\r\narrived at Easton, July 20, and the next day the conference with the\r\nIndians was formally begun. Colonel Conrad Weiser and Colonel George\r\nCroghan were in attendance as interpreters and agents; there were more\r\nthan 300 Indians representing ten nations, and Tedyuskung claimed\r\nauthority over them all.\r\n\r\nTedyuskung demanded a clerk and refused to participate until furnished\r\none, when a long debate ensued, but the old king won his point and chose\r\nCharles Thomson. Thomson exercised great influence over Tedyuskung and\r\nwas his counsel as well as clerk.\r\n\r\nThe conference proceeded in peace. Tedyuskung declared it was time to\r\ndeclare mutual friendship and gave the Governor a belt of wampum. The\r\nGovernor rejoiced in this expression of alliance and gave the Delaware a\r\nfine belt of wampum. This was a large belt with the figures of three men\r\nworked in the wampum, representing King George, taking hold of the King\r\nof the Five Nations with one hand, and Tedyuskung with the other, and\r\nmarked “G. R., 5 N and D. K.,” for King George, Five Nations and\r\nDelaware King.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, August 6, Paxinosa, with Abraham, the Mohegan Chief,\r\narrived at Easton, with about sixty of their people. The Governor\r\npersonally welcomed the newcomers to the council.\r\n\r\nThe most important matter broached by Tedyuskung touched on the future\r\nhome of the Delaware. He then asked that persons be sent to instruct\r\nthem to build permanent houses of a better class, and that other persons\r\nbe sent “to instruct us in Christian religion, and instruct our children\r\nin reading and writing.”\r\n\r\nTedyuskung then expressed a desire that the Governor would send people\r\nto Wyoming during the coming fall or nearly next Spring, that a little\r\nfort might be built. The Indians would then move down from Tioga, about\r\nthe beginning of May.\r\n\r\nThe conference came to an end on Sunday, August 7. The Governor and his\r\nattendants left for Bethlehem, enroute to Philadelphia. The following\r\nday many Indians were escorted by Conrad Weiser and a detachment of\r\nProvincials under Captain Jacob Arndt, towards Bethlehem.\r\n\r\nThe “Memorials of the Moravian Church” says, “Some of these unwelcome\r\nvisitors halted for a few days and some proceeded as far as Fort Allen\r\nand then returned, undecided as to where to go and what to do. During\r\nthe month full 200 were counted—men, women and children—among them\r\nlawless crowds who annoyed the Brethren by depredations, molested the\r\nIndians at Manakasy, and wrangled with each other over their cup at “The\r\nCrown.”\r\n\r\nTedyuskung, Abraham and Paxinosa set out from Fort Allen for Tioga,\r\nAugust 17, the former with a new saddle and bridle, and a supply of\r\nsnuff, gingerbread, soap and other luxuries—in addition to the gifts he\r\nhad received at the treaty.\r\n\r\nWhen near Tunkhannock, this company was met by three Indian messengers,\r\nwith a Peace Belt and four-fold string of wampum, for Tedyuskung from\r\nthe two principal chiefs in the Ohio region. The King gave the Peace\r\nBelt he had received at Easton into the hands of one of his sons and\r\nmessengers, directing them to carry it with a message which he dictated\r\nto the Ohio chiefs. Then he left his companions and started back to\r\nBethlehem, where he arrived August 25. Five days later he arrived in\r\nPhiladelphia and delivered the message from the Ohio Indians to the\r\nGovernor and Council.\r\n\r\nTedyuskung urged the prompt assistance of the government in helping them\r\nlocate at Wyoming, and a week later the Governor and Council decided to\r\nsend proper persons to build a fort and houses for the Delaware. After\r\nmuch discussion it was decided to send John Hughes, one of the Indian\r\nCommissioners, Edward Shippen, prothonotary of the Lancaster County\r\ncourts, and James Galbraith, also of Lancaster, and a prominent citizen\r\nto undertake the journey to Wyoming. On October 5, 1757, they set out\r\nand satisfactorily fulfilled the mission on which they were sent.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Indians Surprise Reapers and Mortally\r\n                    Wound James Brady August 8, 1778\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the first several years of the Revolution no section of\r\nPennsylvania suffered more from the incursions of the hostile Indians\r\nthan along both branches of the Susquehanna River, where nearly every\r\nman capable of bearing arms responded to the call and left his home and\r\nfireside in the care of aged men or young men of his family.\r\n\r\nThe Indians had taken a heavy toll along the West Branch, so small\r\nnumbers of local militia and a few provincials garrisoned the several\r\nstockades erected as places of refuge for the inhabitants, when the\r\nIndians were reported by the scouts to be approaching.\r\n\r\nAugust 8, 1778, a party of Indians fell upon a number of reapers and\r\ncruelly murdered young James Brady. The circumstances of the tragic\r\naffair, and the prominence of the victim and his illustrious family make\r\nthe story one of value.\r\n\r\nColonel Thomas Hartley had been sent by General Washington to guard the\r\nWest Branch Valley, and after arriving at Fort Augusta with his command,\r\nit was determined he should proceed to Muncy, erect a stockade, and from\r\nthat place distribute his soldiers to points where they were most\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nOn the fatal day a corporal and three militiamen were ordered to go to\r\nLoyalsock and protect fourteen reapers and cradlers who were assisting\r\nPeter Smith, the unfortunate man who lost his wife and four children in\r\nthe massacre, at what is now Williamsport, June 10. Smith’s farm was on\r\nBull Run, nearly three miles east of Williamsport, and on the north side\r\nof the river.\r\n\r\nIt was the custom in those days of unusual peril, when no commissioned\r\nofficer was present, for the company to select a leader, who was called\r\n“Captain,” and to obey him accordingly. Young James Brady, on account of\r\nhis shrewdness, dash and well known bravery, was selected to take\r\ncommand of the party.\r\n\r\n“Captain” Brady stationed a few sentinels and the rest proceeded to the\r\nwork at hand on Friday, August 7. At sundown four of the party left and\r\nreturned to Fort Muncy. The balance of the detail commenced work early\r\nthe next day; the morning was foggy.\r\n\r\nNot an hour had passed before the workers were surprised by the stealthy\r\napproach of a large band of Indians, who were able to draw near under\r\nthe cover of the fog before being discovered.\r\n\r\nThe sentinels discharged their rifles at the savages and ran towards the\r\nreapers. A panic ensued and they all fled with the exception of young\r\nBrady, who ran for his rifle, closely pursued by three Indians. When\r\nalmost within reach of his gun, an Indian shot at Brady, who was\r\nprobably saved by his timely fall over a sheaf of wheat. When he grasped\r\nfor his rifle he was shot in the arm, but succeeded in killing the\r\nIndian who fired at him.\r\n\r\nBrady grabbed a second rifle and as quickly dispatched another Indian,\r\nbut the savages now closed in on him, and he fought bravely until a\r\nwarrior struck him with his tomahawk and another pierced him with a\r\nspear, which felled him to the ground. Brady had no sooner fallen than\r\nhis scalp was torn from his head, and a young Indian was called upon to\r\nstrike him with his tomahawk. The Indians then fled in great haste.\r\n\r\nBrady recovered consciousness, and succeeded by walking and creeping, in\r\nreaching the cabin of an old man, named Jerome Vanness, near the bank of\r\nthe river, who had been employed to cook for Brady and his companions\r\nwhile on this tour of duty.\r\n\r\nVanness heard the firing and had concealed himself, but on seeing Brady\r\napproach, rushed to his assistance. Brady urged the aged man to fly for\r\nhis own safety, but he refused to leave his “captain,” and dressed his\r\nterrible wounds as best he could.\r\n\r\nBrady requested to be assisted down to the river, where he drank much\r\nwater, and lay until Vanness went back for his gun.\r\n\r\nWhen the terrified reapers and militiamen reached Fort Muncy, Captain\r\nAndrew Walker hurried a detail to Smith’s farm. On approaching the spot\r\nwhere the gallant Brady lay weltering in his blood, he heard the relief\r\nparty, and supposing them to be Indians, immediately jumped to his feet,\r\ncocked his rifle, and prepared to defend himself.\r\n\r\nWhen Brady found the party to be friends, he requested to be taken to\r\nhis mother, who was visiting among relatives at Sunbury.\r\n\r\nHe was tenderly cared for, placed in a canoe, and taken rapidly down the\r\nriver. During the trip of nearly thirty miles he became delirious.\r\n\r\nWhen the party arrived at Sunbury, although it was nearly midnight, his\r\nmother met the canoe at the landing and assisted to convey her wounded\r\nson to the house.\r\n\r\nBrady presented a frightful appearance and the grief of his mother was\r\npitiable. He lived five days, dying in the arms of his devoted mother,\r\nAugust 13, 1778.\r\n\r\nOn the day of his death his reason returned and he related with much\r\ndetail the bloody scene through which he had passed.\r\n\r\nSome writers have stated that Chief Bald Eagle scalped him, and that his\r\nbrother, Captain Samuel Brady, afterwards avenged his death by shooting\r\nBald Eagle through the heart.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate young hero was buried near Fort Augusta. He was mourned\r\nby all who knew him.\r\n\r\nJames Brady was the second son of Captain John and Mary Brady, and a\r\nyounger brother of Captain Samuel Brady, the famous scout and Indian\r\nkiller. He was born in 1758, while his parents lived at Shippensburg,\r\nCumberland County, and was in his twenty-first year at the time of his\r\ntragic death.\r\n\r\nMany anecdotes of the Brady family have been handed down, and one\r\nrelating to James is interesting. The men of that time wore their hair\r\nlong, plaited and cued behind the head. James had a remarkably fine head\r\nof fiery red hair. A neighbor remarked that she feared the Indians would\r\nget this red scalp. James replied: “If they do, it will make them a\r\nbright light of a dark night.” In less than a week the noble youth fell\r\nbeneath the cruel tomahawk and the savages had his red scalp.\r\n\r\nHis father, Captain John Brady, was murdered near Muncy by the Indians,\r\nApril 11, 1779, while home on a leave of absence from the Continental\r\nArmy.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              General John Bull, Distinguished Officer of\r\n                 Revolutionary War, Died August 9, 1824\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the early patriots of the Revolution was Colonel John Bull, and he\r\nwas quite as much a distinguished citizen and statesman. John Bull was\r\nborn in 1730, in Providence Township, now Montgomery County. He was\r\nappointed captain in the Provincial service, May 12, 1758, and the\r\nfollowing month was in command of the garrison at Fort Allen.\r\n\r\nIn October the same year he accompanied General John Forbes’ expedition\r\nfor the reduction of Fort Duquesne, and rendered important service in\r\nthe negotiations with the Indians. The instructions to Captain Bull were\r\ndated Easton, October 21, 1758, and are most specific. He and William\r\nHayes had volunteered to carry important messages to the Indians on the\r\nOhio.\r\n\r\nPesquetomen and Thomas Hickman, two Delaware Indians from the Ohio,\r\naccompanied the provincial messengers, who set out in October, going by\r\nway of Reading and Fort Henry to Fort Augusta, where they were equipped\r\nand supplied with such articles as they needed. They carried belts of\r\nwampum and even the outlines of the speeches they were to make to the\r\nwestern Indians when in council. This mission was performed to the\r\nentire satisfaction of the Provincial Government and John Bull became at\r\nonce a trusted official on important occasions.\r\n\r\nIn 1771 Captain Bull owned the Norris plantation and mill, and was\r\nresiding there at the opening of the Revolution. This is on the present\r\nsite of Norristown. He was a delegate to the Provincial Conferences of\r\nJanuary 23, 1775, and of June 18, 1775, and a member of the Provincial\r\nConvention of July 15, 1776.\r\n\r\nThe First Pennsylvania Battalion was raised in pursuance of a resolution\r\nof Congress, October 12, 1775. The field officers were elected by\r\nCongress, November 25, and John Bull was commissioned a colonel.\r\n\r\nOn January 20, 1776, the Colonel resigned in a communication to Congress\r\nsetting forth that he was ill-treated by many of the officers and that\r\nnearly one-half of them threatened to resign if he continued in command.\r\nHe also stated that this circumstance would not alter his conduct or\r\nabate his zeal, and whenever called upon again to serve his country, he\r\nwould, with the greatest pleasure, obey the summons. Colonel Bull was\r\nsucceeded by Colonel John Philip DeHaas, of Lebanon, who was\r\ncommissioned two days later.\r\n\r\nColonel Bull served as one of the Commissioners at the important Indian\r\ntreaty held at Easton, January 30, 1777; in February he was in command\r\nof the works at Billingsport.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Executive Council created the Board of War, March 13, 1777,\r\nand named Colonel John Bull as one of the original members. They\r\norganized the following day.\r\n\r\nOn May 2, he was commissioned colonel of the State Regiment of Foot,\r\nwhich was organized with the residue of the battalions of Colonels\r\nSamuel Miles and Samuel J. Atlee, as a nucleus. June 2 this regiment was\r\nstationed at Fort Mercer, under command of Colonel Bull, its strength\r\nbeing four hundred and sixty-three.\r\n\r\nAs Colonel Bull was not an officer of either battalion, the other\r\nofficers claimed his appointment ruined their rank, and as the regiment\r\nwas put in the Continental service, June 10, 1777, the Supreme Executive\r\nCouncil appointed Colonel Bull adjutant general of the militia of\r\nPennsylvania, and appointed Walter Stewart to the command of the\r\nregiment, which participated at Brandywine and Germantown.\r\n\r\nHe was also colonel of the Sixth Battalion of Associators, of\r\nPhiladelphia, during 1777. During October of this year, Colonel Bull’s\r\nbarns, barracks, grain and hay were burned by the British, and his\r\nwagons, horses, sheep and Negroes carried off, although General Howe had\r\ngiven his word to Mrs. Bull that they would not be disturbed.\r\n\r\nIn December, Brigadier General James Irvine was wounded and captured in\r\nthe attempted surprise by the British at Whitemarsh, and Colonel Bull\r\nsucceeded to the command of the Second Brigade Pennsylvania Militia,\r\nunder command of General John Armstrong.\r\n\r\nDuring Christmas week, 1777, the British crossed the Delaware and made a\r\nraid into New Jersey, another detachment at the same time crossed at\r\nGray’s Ferry and took the road to Chester and Darby, with three hundred\r\nwagons. Howe and Erskine were with them; they made a demonstration\r\ntowards Chester. Several pickets and detachments skirmished on their\r\nfront and flank, under Captain Potterfield.\r\n\r\nColonel John Bull, with his brigade marched to force the foragers to\r\nretire by demonstrating against the enemy’s lines. His forces were\r\ndistributed on the Frankford, Germantown and Ridge Roads, and caused the\r\nenemy to sound a general alarm. Bull planted his cannon, on Christmas\r\nDay, and fired several shots at the heart of the city, then withdrew to\r\nFrankford.\r\n\r\nMarshall says: “Col. Bull, on the twenty-fifth instant, made an\r\nexcursion into Fourth Street, Philadelphia, with two thousand militia,\r\nand alarmed the city by firing some pieces of cannon into the air,\r\nwhereby some of the ball fell about Christ Church. He then made a good\r\nretreat back to his station, without the loss of a man.” The enemy,\r\nhowever, made no more raids.\r\n\r\nIn 1778 and 1779 he was engaged in erecting the defenses for\r\nPhiladelphia; in 1779 he put down the chevaux de frize in the Delaware,\r\nand in 1780 he was Commissary of Purchases at Philadelphia, and appears\r\nto have been one of the busiest and most indefatigable of workers.\r\n\r\nAfter the Revolution General Bull located at Northumberland, this was\r\nabout 1785. In 1802 he was a candidate for the Legislature, but was\r\ndefeated by Simon Snyder; in 1803, 1804 and 1805 he was elected to the\r\nLegislature, and three years later was defeated for Congress on the\r\nFederalist ticket.\r\n\r\nGeneral Bull died August 9, 1824, at the extreme age of ninety-four\r\nyears. His wife, Mary Phillips Bull, died February 23, 1811, aged eighty\r\nyears. The Northumberland Argus says “she was buried in the Quaker\r\ngraveyard and General Bull, though much reduced by sickness and old age,\r\nprevious to the grave being closed addressed the people as follows:\r\n\r\n“'The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away, blessed be the name of the\r\nLord; may we who are soon to follow be as well prepared as she was.'”\r\n\r\nTruly a soldier to the very end of his eventful life.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Colonel Bouquet Relieved Garrison at Fort\r\n                          Pitt August 10, 1763\r\n\r\n\r\nColonel Henry Bouquet established his rendezvous in Carlisle during the\r\nlatter part of June, 1763, where he had assembled five hundred troops,\r\nselected from his British forces and several companies of Provincial\r\nRangers. He was preparing to rush to the succor of Fort Pitt and other\r\nplaces which were being attacked by Indians under the inspiring\r\nleadership of Pontiac, the great chief of the Ottawa, who had formed a\r\nconfederation of the Indians against the English.\r\n\r\nEverywhere along the frontier of Pennsylvania was desolation, the\r\nsettlers had fled in terror and the interior settlements were crowded\r\nwith refugees. Especially is this true of Carlisle, where the brave\r\nSwiss, Colonel Bouquet, was receiving first hand intelligence of the\r\nsufferings and devastation caused by the savages.\r\n\r\nOn July 3, 1763, a courier from Fort Bedford rode into Carlisle, and as\r\nhe stopped to water his horse, he was surrounded by an anxious crowd, to\r\nwhom he told a sad tale of woe, and as he hurriedly mounted his horse to\r\nride to Colonel Bouquet’s tent, he shouted, “The Indians will soon be\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\nTerror and excitement spread everywhere, messengers were dispatched in\r\nevery direction to give the alarm, and the reports, harrowing as they\r\nhad been, were confirmed by the fugitives who were met on every road and\r\nby-path hurrying to Carlisle for refuge.\r\n\r\nA party armed themselves and went out to warn the living and bury the\r\ndead. They found death and destruction everywhere, and sickened with\r\nhorror at seeing groups of hogs tearing and devouring the bodies of the\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nAfter a delay of eighteen days, Bouquet secured enough wagons, horses\r\nand oxen, and began his perilous march towards Fort Pitt. His force was\r\nmuch smaller than General Braddock’s and he had to encounter a foe much\r\nmore formidable. But Bouquet, the man of iron will and iron hand, had\r\nserved seven years in American forests and, unlike the unfortunate\r\nBraddock, understood his work.\r\n\r\nOn July 25 Bouquet reached Fort Bedford, where he was fortunate in\r\nsecuring thirty backwoodsmen to accompany him. This little army toiled\r\nthrough the blazing heat of July over the Allegheny Mountains, and\r\nreached Fort Ligonier August 2.\r\n\r\nThe Indians who had besieged that fort for two months disappeared at the\r\napproach of the troops. Here Bouquet left his oxen and wagons and\r\nresumed his march two days later. At noon on the 5th he encountered the\r\nenemy at Bushy Run. A terrible battle raged for two days when the\r\nIndians were put to rout. The loss of the British was one hundred and\r\nfifteen men and eight officers. The little army was then twenty-five\r\nmiles distant from Fort Pitt, which place was reached August 10.\r\n\r\nThe enemy had abandoned the siege on this fort and marched their forces\r\nto unite with those engaged in combat with Colonel Bouquet at Bushy Run,\r\nso when they were compelled to retreat after that battle, they had not\r\nsufficient time, or lacked the courage to attack Fort Pitt with Colonel\r\nBouquet in hot pursuit.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that Colonel Bouquet built the little redoubt which\r\nis at the present all that remains of Fort Pitt, in fact is the only\r\nexisting monument of British occupancy in the vicinity of Pittsburgh.\r\n\r\nThe Indians abandoned all their former settlements, and retreated to the\r\nMuskingum; here they formed new settlements, and in the spring of 1764\r\nagain began to ravage the frontier. To put an end to these depredations,\r\nGeneral Gage planned a campaign into the western wilderness from two\r\npoints. General Bradstreet was ordered to advance by way of the lakes,\r\nand Colonel Bouquet was to go forward from Fort Pitt.\r\n\r\nAfter the usual delays and disappointments in securing troops from\r\nPennsylvania and Virginia to aid in this expedition Colonel Bouquet\r\nagain arrived at Fort Pitt, September 17, where he was detained until\r\nOctober 3. He led his troops from Fort Pitt following the north bank of\r\nthe Ohio until he reached the Beaver, where he turned towards central\r\nOhio.\r\n\r\nBouquet refused to listen to either threats or promises from the\r\nIndians, and declined to treat with them at all until they should\r\ndeliver up their prisoners. Although not a single blow was struck the\r\nIndians were vanquished.\r\n\r\nBouquet continued his march down the valley of the Muskingum until he\r\nreached a spot where some broad meadows offered a suitable place for\r\nencampment. Here he received a deputation of principal chiefs, listened\r\nto their offers of peace, and demanded the delivery of all the\r\nprisoners. Soon band after band of captives arrived, until more than\r\nthree hundred were brought into the encampment.\r\n\r\nThe scenes which followed the restoration of these prisoners to their\r\nfamilies and friends beggar all description; wives recovering their\r\nhusbands, husbands their wives, parents regaining children whom they\r\ncould scarcely recognize, brothers and sisters meeting after long\r\nseparation and sometimes hardly able to converse in the same language.\r\n\r\nThe story is told of a woman whose daughter had been carried off nine\r\nyears before. The mother recognized her child among the prisoners, but\r\nthe girl, who had almost forgotten her mother tongue, showed no sign of\r\nrecognition. The mother complained to Colonel Bouquet that the daughter\r\nshe had so often sung to sleep on her knee had forgotten her. “Sing the\r\nsong to her that you used to sing when she was a child,” said Colonel\r\nBouquet. She did so, and with a passionate flood of tears the long lost\r\ndaughter flung herself into her mother’s arms.\r\n\r\nEverything being settled the army broke camp November 18, and arrived\r\nagain at Fort Pitt on the 28th.\r\n\r\nEarly in January Colonel Bouquet returned to Philadelphia, receiving\r\nwherever he went every possible mark of gratitude and esteem from the\r\npeople. The Assembly of Pennsylvania and the House of Burgesses of\r\nVirginia each unanimously voted him addresses of thanks, and on the\r\narrival in England of the first account of this expedition the King\r\npromoted him to the rank of Brigadier General, to command the Southern\r\nDistrict of North America.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Colonel Brodhead Wins Thanks of Congress\r\n                    for Raid Started August 11, 1779\r\n\r\n\r\nRaids on the Pennsylvania and Virginia frontier in 1778 were made by the\r\nIndians of the Ohio country; those of 1779 by the Seneca and Munsee of\r\nthe North, from the upper tributaries of the Susquehanna and Allegheny\r\nRivers.\r\n\r\nThe Seneca tribe of Western New York was the largest of the Six Nations,\r\nand its warriors second only to the Mohawk in courage and military\r\nprowess. Under Cornplanter, Guyasuta and other war captains they\r\ndistressed a wide extent of territory in New York and Pennsylvania and\r\ndecorated their huts with the scalps of hundreds of white persons.\r\n\r\nEarly in the summer of 1779, Washington directed that General John\r\nSullivan lead a large force against the Iroquois country from the east,\r\nand in July Colonel Brodhead received permission to undertake a movement\r\nof cooperation up the Allegheny Valley.\r\n\r\nThe expedition consisting of 615 men under Colonel Brodhead left\r\nPittsburgh August 11, 1779. Small garrisons were left to guard Forts\r\nPitt, McIntosh, Crawford and Armstrong. A small band of Delaware\r\naccompanied the expedition, and acted as scouting parties under Captain\r\nSamuel Brady and Lieutenant Hardin.\r\n\r\nThe provisions were conveyed up the river by boats as far as the mouth\r\nof the Big Mahoning, where the supplies were taken from the boats,\r\nloaded on the horses, and the expedition proceeded under the most\r\nunfavorable conditions. The expedition here left the river and followed\r\nan Indian trail almost due north, through what is now Clarion county.\r\n\r\nA few miles below Brokenstraw Creek occurred a fight with savages, near\r\nwhere Thompson is now situated. Lieutenant Hardin was leading the\r\nadvance, with fifteen white scouts and eight Delaware, when they\r\ndiscovered more than thirty Seneca warriors coming down the river in\r\nseven canoes, under the famous Chief Guyasuta. Each party discovered the\r\nother at about the same time. The Seneca paddled for shore, threw off\r\ntheir shirts and prepared for battle, little aware of the number of\r\ntheir opponents.\r\n\r\nBoth sides took to trees and rocks and began a sharp fusillade, until a\r\nfew minutes another party of scouts appeared, took the Seneca on the\r\nflank and poured a hot fire upon them. At the sound of this firing\r\nColonel Brodhead formed his column so as to protect his pack train and\r\nthen hurried forward with reinforcements. He arrived just in time to\r\nwitness the retreat of the Seneca, who now realized the strength of the\r\nwhite force. Five Indians were killed and several wounded. Eight guns\r\nand seven canoes containing their blankets, shirts and provisions were\r\nprizes. Only three of Brodhead’s men were slightly wounded.\r\n\r\nThe army went into camp near the scene of the conflict and on the\r\nfollowing morning moved to Brokenstraw Creek. Here Colonel Brodhead\r\ndecided to leave his stores and baggage and march light to Conewago. A\r\nrude breastwork was constructed of fallen trees and bundles of faggots,\r\non a high bluff which commanded an extensive view up and down the river.\r\nThis post was garrisoned by an officer and forty men, while the\r\nexpedition pushed on for Conewago. Upon arrival the Colonel was\r\ndisappointed to find the Iroquois town deserted and their huts falling\r\ninto decay.\r\n\r\nAfter a hard march of twenty miles the army came again within sight of\r\nthe Allegheny River, and from a hilltop they discovered a number of\r\nIndian villages, surrounded by great fields of splendid corn and patches\r\nof beans, squashes and melons. This Iroquois settlement extended for\r\neight miles along the fertile bottom land of the Allegheny River, where\r\nthe great Cornplanter reservation was afterwards established.\r\n\r\nThe Indian spies had discovered the approach of the American forces, and\r\nthe warriors had fled so hastily with their women and children that they\r\nleft behind many deer skins and other articles of value.\r\n\r\nThe Iroquois had long before this learned to build substantial log\r\nhouses, even squaring the timbers as was the custom of the white pioneer\r\nsettlers. In this village there were about 130 houses, some of them\r\nlarge enough to accommodate three or four families.\r\n\r\nColonel Brodhead sent a report to General Washington, saying: “The\r\ntroops remained on the ground three whole days, destroying the towns and\r\ncorn fields. I never saw finer corn, although it was planted much\r\nthicker than is common with our farmers. The quantity of corn and\r\nvegetables destroyed at the several towns, from the best accounts I can\r\ncollect from the officers employed to destroy it, must certainly exceed\r\n500 acres, which is the lowest estimate and the plunder taken is\r\nestimated at $3,000. From the great quantity of corn in the ground and\r\nthe number of new houses built and building, it appears that the whole\r\nSeneca and Muncy nations intended to collect in this settlement.”\r\n\r\nOn the return march the supplies were picked up at Buckaloons and the\r\ntroops marched across country to French Creek. At Oil Creek the soldiers\r\nrubbed themselves freely with oil which they found floating on the\r\nwater, and received great relief from their rheumatic pains and\r\nstiffness. For many years this petroleum was called Seneca oil, and was\r\nsupposed to be valuable only for its medicinal qualities.\r\n\r\nThe army soon reached French Creek, at the mouth of the Conneaut Creek,\r\nwhere the Munsee town of Maghingue-chahocking was found to be deserted.\r\nIt consisted of 35 large huts, which were burned. The Munsee formed a\r\nbranch of the Wolf clan of the Delaware, and they enjoyed an unenviable\r\nreputation as thieves, murderers and general desperadoes.\r\n\r\nThe army descended French Creek almost to its mouth and thence returned\r\nto Fort Pitt by what is known as the Venango path almost due north and\r\nsouth through the heart of Butler County.\r\n\r\nThe expedition arrived at Fort Pitt on September 14 without the loss of\r\na man or a horse. Brodhead wrote: “I have a happy presage that the\r\ncounties of Westmoreland, Bedford and Northumberland, if not the whole\r\nwestern frontier, will experience the good effect of it. Too much praise\r\ncannot be given to both officers and soldiers of every corps during the\r\nwhole expedition. Their perseverance and zeal can scarcely be equaled in\r\nhistory.”\r\n\r\nThe thanks of Congress were voted to Colonel Brodhead, and in a general\r\norder, issued October 18, General Washington said: “The activity,\r\nperseverance, and firmness of all the officers and men of every\r\ndescription in this expedition, do them great honor, and their services\r\nentitle them to the thanks and to this testimonial of the General’s\r\nacknowledgement.”\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             Era of Indian Traders to Death of Allummapees,\r\n                            August 12, 1731\r\n\r\n\r\nAt what date and by whom the North and West Branch Valleys of the\r\nSusquehanna and the Juniata Valley were first traversed, and the\r\nAlleghenies first crossed by Europeans in a journey to the Ohio, is\r\nunrecorded, and must forever remain unknown.\r\n\r\nThe first white men who ventured into the unexplored forests among these\r\nmountains were not given to keeping journals of their travels for future\r\nhistorians. No one seems to have thought of immortalizing himself by\r\nbequeathing to us a good description giving minute details of the\r\ncountry and its tribes.\r\n\r\nAt first the natives brought their peltry hundreds of miles to the\r\nDelaware River; but, in course of time, these skins and furs became so\r\nvaluable in Europe that many of the worst class of men were stimulated\r\nto penetrate the depths of the forest in order to hasten and monopolize\r\nthe trade. In this way the entire Juniata and West Branch regions were\r\ntraversed many years before there was a settlement established in those\r\nfertile valleys.\r\n\r\nFrom the days of William Penn’s advent up to 1722 the Indian expenses to\r\nthe Province were inconsiderable, being limited by law to £50 per annum.\r\nIn that year the Assembly paid Governor Keith’s expenses for a trip to\r\nAlbany, where an important council with the Six Nations was held, but in\r\n1727 they refused to pay more than half the amount of an account of\r\nConrad Weiser, who was sent on a similar mission. In 1728, under an\r\nalarm, they agreed to pay without limitation the expenses of an Indian\r\nconference. After this they sometimes paid half, and sometimes all.\r\n\r\nThe appetite for presents which the Indians acquired was not easily\r\nappeased. Constant disturbances, frequently caused by rum, called for\r\nexpensive treaties, and the donations allured the Indians and made them\r\nmore insolent and exacting. The expenses soon rose above £8,000, and the\r\nquestion whether these treaties were more for the benefit of the\r\nProprietaries in buying lands than for the safety of the inhabitants\r\ngave rise to heated controversy. The result was that Indian affairs\r\nbegan to take a wider and more public range, and the records of those\r\ndays begin to throw more light upon the uninhabited interior of the\r\nProvince.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1722 we read that “William Wilkins was 150 miles up the\r\nSasquehannah trading for his master.” His master was John Cartlidge, an\r\nIndian trader living at Conestoga, and 150 miles farther up the\r\nSusquehanna was a venturesome trip at that date. There are also records\r\nof several Frenchmen engaged in the trade living among the Indians east\r\nof the mountains, extending their travels up the Susquehanna and its\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\nA great council was held in Philadelphia, July 3, 1727, with the chiefs\r\nof the Six Nations, but most of those in attendance were Cayuga,\r\nConestoga and Ganawese. Madame Montour, the celebrated interpreter, was\r\npresent at this conference and exerted her great influence toward an\r\namicable treaty.\r\n\r\nIn an address made by one of the chiefs to the Governor, he said: “They\r\ndesire that there may be no settlements made up the Sasquhannah higher\r\nthan Pextan (Harrisburg), and that none of the settlers thereabouts be\r\nsuffered to sell or keep any rum there, for that being the road by which\r\ntheir people go out to war, they are apprehensive of mischief if they\r\nmeet with liquor in these parts. They desire also, for the same reasons,\r\nthat none of the traders be allowed to carry any rum to the remoter\r\nparts where James Le Tort trades,—that is, Allegany on the branch of\r\nOhio. And this they desire may be taken notice of, as the mind of the\r\nchiefs of all the Five Nations, for it is all those nations that now\r\nspeak by them to all our people.”\r\n\r\nThe following day the Governor made this reply: “We have not hitherto\r\nallowed any settlements to be made above Pextan, but, as the young\r\npeople grow up, they will spread, of course, yet it will not be very\r\nspeedily. The Governor, however, will give orders to them all to be\r\ncivil to those of the Five Nations as they pass that way, though it\r\nwould be better if they would pass the Susquehannah above the mountains.\r\nAnd the sale of rum shall be prohibited both there and at Alegany; but\r\nthe woods are so thick and dark we cannot see what is done in them. The\r\nIndians may stave any rum they find in the Woods, but, as has been said,\r\nthey must not drink or carry any away.”\r\n\r\nThe interesting fact ascertained from these two addresses is that James\r\nLe Tort, who had settled near Carlisle, as early as 1720, and was a well\r\nknown trader, had already passed over the Allegheny Mountains and\r\nestablished his trading post on the Ohio River. As he was also known to\r\nhave lived and traded as early as 1701 on the island at the Forks of the\r\nSusquehanna, long known as Packer’s Island, between Sunbury and\r\nNorthumberland, it may be fairly inferred that Le Tort found his way to\r\nthe West through the West Branch Valley and thence by the Indian path\r\nleading from Great Island through what is now Clearfield and Kittaning\r\nto the west.\r\n\r\nThis is interesting also because it was at this time that the Shawnee\r\nbegan to pass over the mountains, followed by some Delaware, especially\r\nthose of Conestoga descent, and began to settle on the Ohio. The Shawnee\r\nhad established a large village at the mouth of Chillisquaque Creek,\r\nwhere it empties into the West Branch, a mile below Lewisburg on the\r\neast side of the stream.\r\n\r\nThe second inference is that at the date of the above conference there\r\nwere white people already seated on the Juniata and Susquehanna, farther\r\nwest than Paxtang, or there were already such decided symptoms of danger\r\nin that direction that the Iroquois deputies considered it necessary to\r\nforbid that anyone should presume to settle beyond the Kittatinny\r\nMountains. A violation of this precautionary restriction led to a series\r\nof complaints about intruders into these valleys for the next thirty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nDuring the first quarter of the eighteenth century the history of Indian\r\naffairs on the Susquehanna and Juniata, and especially the West Branch\r\nof the former river, is nearly all connected closely with the Iroquois\r\nagency on the northern border of the Province.\r\n\r\nThe principal representatives of this great Nation were Allummapees,\r\nalso called Sassoonan, the great Delaware King, and Shikellamy, the\r\ngreat Oneida vicegerent.\r\n\r\nAllummapees resided at Paxtang, as early as 1709. He removed from\r\nPaxtang to Shamokin about 1718, and there resided among the Munsee, the\r\nmost belligerent of the Lenape clans. He ruled as king from 1718 till\r\nhis death. He was a good-hearted chieftain, true to the English and an\r\nadvocate of peace. When he died he was supposed to be one hundred years\r\nof age. His death occurred August 12, 1731, when in a state of helpless\r\nintoxication he was stabbed to the heart by his nephew, Shockatawlin, of\r\nwhom Allummapees was jealous.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Indians Massacre Major John Lee and\r\n                        Family, August 13, 1782\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the evening of August 13, 1782, John Lee and his family with one or\r\ntwo neighbors were seated at the supper table in their comfortable log\r\nhome in what is now Winfield, Union County. Without a moment’s warning a\r\nband of Indians, supposed to be sixty or seventy in number, rushed in on\r\nthem, and killed Lee and his family. The events of this crime rank among\r\nthe most cruel and revolting of those along the frontier.\r\n\r\nA young woman, named Katy Stoner, hurried upstairs and concealed herself\r\nbehind the chimney, where she remained undiscovered and escaped. She\r\nrelated the details of this horrible tragedy.\r\n\r\nLee was tomahawked and scalped, and an old man named John Walker shared\r\nthe same fate. Mrs. Claudius Boatman and daughter, who were guests of\r\nthe Lees, were killed and scalped; Mrs. Lee, with her small child, and a\r\nlarger boy, named Thomas, were led away captives.\r\n\r\nThe savages fled from the scene along the Great Path, leading up that\r\nside of the West Branch Valley, over the White Deer Mountains, and then\r\ncrossed to the eastern side of the river below Muncy.\r\n\r\nOne of Lee’s sons, Robert, happened to be absent and thus escaped the\r\nfate of his parents. He was returning, however, and came in sight of the\r\nhouse just as the Indians were leaving it, but they did not observe him.\r\nHe fled to Northumberland and gave the alarm.\r\n\r\nA party of about twenty volunteers was organized by Colonel Samuel\r\nHunter, at Fort Augusta, and hastened in pursuit. On arriving at Lee’s\r\nhouse they beheld some of the victims yet alive and writhing in agony.\r\nLee was not dead, and Mrs. Boatman’s daughter also survived. Litters\r\nwere hastily constructed, and they were carried to Fort Augusta. Lee\r\nexpired in great agony soon after arrival at the fort. Miss Boatman was\r\nnursed back to health and lived many years afterwards.\r\n\r\nColonel Hunter and his party, without delaying to bury the dead, pushed\r\non after the savages as rapidly as possible with a view of overtaking\r\nthem, and releasing the captives. They came in sight of them above\r\nLycoming Creek.\r\n\r\nIn crossing White Deer Mountains Mrs. Lee was accidentally bitten on her\r\nankle by a rattlesnake, and her leg became so swollen and pained her so\r\nseverely, that she traveled with great difficulty. The Indians, finding\r\nthemselves pursued, urged her along as fast as possible, but she\r\nweakened rapidly. When near the mouth of Pine Creek, about four miles\r\nbelow the present Jersey Shore, Mrs. Lee’s strength failed her and she\r\nseated herself on the ground.\r\n\r\nThe whites were rapidly approaching and the Indians were afraid she\r\nwould fall into their hands. A warrior stealthily slipped up behind her,\r\nplaced the muzzle of his rifle close to her head and fired. The entire\r\nupper portion of her head was blown off. One of the Indians then\r\nsnatched up her young child and holding it by the feet, dashed it\r\nagainst a tree.\r\n\r\nThe Indians then fled with renewed speed, crossing the river at Smith’s\r\nfording, at Level Corner, and hurried up through Nippenose Valley.\r\n\r\nWhen Colonel Hunter and his men came up to where Mrs. Lee was murdered\r\nher body was yet warm. The sight was horrible. The child was but little\r\ninjured, but was found moaning piteously.\r\n\r\nThe pursuit was now so hot that near Antes’ Gap, the Indians separated,\r\nand ran up both sides of the mountains. Colonel Hunter concluded that\r\nfurther pursuit was imprudent, and the chase was abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe detail returned, buried the body of Mrs. Lee, and brought back the\r\nchild. At Lee’s house they halted and buried the dead there.\r\n\r\nYoung Thomas Lee who was taken prisoner, was not recovered for many\r\nyears afterwards. The son, Robert, made arrangements with the Indians to\r\nbring his brother to Tioga Point, where he was delivered to his friends.\r\nSuch was the love of Indian life, however, that he was so reluctant to\r\nreturn, they were obliged to bind him and place him in a canoe. When\r\nnear Wilkes Barre they untied him, but as soon as the canoe touched\r\nshore he darted off like a deer. It was several hours before he was\r\nretaken. On arriving at Northumberland he evinced all the sullenness of\r\na captive. Indian boys and girls, near his own age were made to play\r\nabout him for days before he showed any disposition to join with them.\r\nAt last he began to inquire the names of things, and by degrees he\r\nbecame civilized, obtained a good education, and lived a useful life.\r\n\r\nThomas lived on the home farm for many years, as is proved by a deed\r\nwhich he and his wife, Eliza, executed April 1, 1797, to William Beard\r\nand Sarah, his wife. Robert Lee and his descendants lived on part of the\r\nproperty as late as the beginning of the 19th century.\r\n\r\nThe massacre at Lee’s home resulted in the death of seven persons, and\r\nonly four of the six taken captive were returned to their kin. The\r\nothers were two sisters and a brother, liberated in 1785.\r\n\r\nSince the beginning of spring in the year 1782, there had been sixty-two\r\ninhabitants butchered by the Indians.\r\n\r\nJudge John Joseph Henry, in a letter to Secretary of War, says that when\r\nhis father was returning home from Congress, then sitting in New York\r\n(1784–85), he found Rebecca Lee on the road desolate and moneyless. He\r\ntook her to his own home in Lancaster, and, a few months later, restored\r\nher to their brother, Robert, at Northumberland. The sister was\r\nrecovered at Albany a year later, and Thomas was turned over to his\r\nbrother in 1788.\r\n\r\nLee was the assessor in the township in which he lived. The Indians\r\nhated him because they believed he had cheated them in a trade and they\r\nsought an opportunity for revenge.\r\n\r\nLee was a prominent citizen, a major in the Northumberland militia,\r\nFebruary 7, 1776, and December 26, following, when a company volunteered\r\nfor the main army, Lee was chosen captain. The company was attached to\r\nColonel James Potter’s Second Battalion and saw much active service.\r\n\r\nClaudius Boatman was a Frenchman and after the massacre of his wife, he\r\ntook the remainder of his family, in 1786, and settled far up Pine\r\nCreek. He had several daughters, one of whom married John English.\r\nClaudius died in 1802, and was buried in the village of Waterville.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Mollie Maguires Commit Murders on\r\n                    Bloody Saturday, August 14, 1875\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch a great number of outrages were committed in the anthracite coal\r\nregions by the Mollie Maguires on August 14, 1875, that the day came to\r\nbe known as “Bloody Saturday.”\r\n\r\nEarly in the month symptoms of smouldering disorder began to increase in\r\nseverity and numbers. The situation became so alarming that\r\nSuperintendent Franklin, of the Philadelphia and Reading Company\r\narranged to hold a meeting with the two great Pinkerton detectives,\r\nJames McParlan and Captain Linden, who had been working for some time\r\namong the members of this outrageous organization of criminals.\r\n\r\nThis meeting was held at Glen Onoko, in the environs of Mauch Chunk.\r\nHere the three men cleverly managed to get together, and in the quiet\r\nshadows of the great hills, in that Switzerland of America, they fully\r\ndiscussed the situation and the work being performed.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that while they were returning from this meeting\r\nMcParlan, otherwise James McKenna, as he was known to the Mollies,\r\nencountered some of the ringleaders of that organization: Alexander\r\nCampbell, Hugh McGehan, and others, all under suspicion for murder.\r\n\r\nMcParlan found himself in the position where it was necessary to\r\naccompany the Mollies to their homes, but he never was in their company\r\nvery many minutes before he learned much of value to his chief, Allan\r\nPinkerton. Captain Linden remained in Mauch Chunk, and Superintendent\r\nFranklin returned to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nB. F. Yost, a policeman of Tamaqua, had been cruelly murdered, July 6,\r\nand word had reached the detective that John P. Jones, of near Lansford,\r\nCarbon County, was marked as the next victim of the Mollies. He was\r\nmurdered by James Kerrigan, Mike Doyle and Edward Kelly, September 3,\r\nfollowing.\r\n\r\nThe Mollies sat together in the smoking car bound for the Summit.\r\nMcParlan was under suspicion by the Mollies, and Linden had slipped into\r\nthe car unobserved, ready at any moment to take the part of his brother\r\ndetective, should he find himself in trouble. Nothing occurred to\r\nrequire his services and Captain Linden feigned to sleep the time away,\r\nuntil the drunken crowd left the car. Linden continued his journey to\r\nTamaqua, and there awaited McParlan’s arrival.\r\n\r\nReaching Summit, Campbell pressed the detective to remain all night at\r\nhis house, and he thought it best not to refuse and did so.\r\n\r\nCampbell believed McParlan or McKenna as he knew him, had been in Mauch\r\nChunk that day to obtain a new stock of counterfeit money, which he was\r\nsupposed to be passing. McKenna had exchanged some money for crisp\r\nbills, but they were genuine. Campbell arranged with the detective for a\r\nsupply of the “spurious” bills, to be delivered in the near future.\r\n\r\nThis tended to restore Campbell’s confidence in McKenna, and they were\r\nsoon discussing Mollie topics with their former freedom of speech.\r\nCampbell was a candidate for the office of body master and McKenna was\r\nstrongly for his election.\r\n\r\nCampbell then told him the plans for killing Jones, and after McKenna\r\nsang “Widow Machree” for Mrs. Campbell, he retired to his apartment.\r\n\r\nThen came the Bloody Saturday events, which proved a horrible experience\r\nfor the people of Mahanoy Valley. The crimes for that day were two\r\ndastardly assassinations and one case of manslaughter, besides several\r\ncases of lesser crimes.\r\n\r\nThe most heinous crime was the murder of Thomas Gwyther, Justice of the\r\nPeace, of Girardville. He was an inoffensive man, of mild disposition\r\nand a reputable, public spirited citizen.\r\n\r\nThe miners of the Mahanoy Valley had this day received the first pay of\r\nany consequence since the long strike began and the result was that\r\nGirardville, in the evening, was crowded with drunken men.\r\n\r\nGangs of ruffians flourished revolvers, looking for some one to shoot. A\r\nfight ensued and an arrest resulted. Application was made of Squire\r\nGwyther for a warrant and as he was in the act of preparing it a man\r\nstepped up to him and shot him dead. The assassin fled and escaped.\r\n\r\nAt Shenandoah, Gomer James, a young Welsh miner, who had defended his\r\nfriend, Tom Jones, when assaulted by Mollies, August 11, 1873, and had\r\nsince been marked by them, was killed at a picnic in Hecksher’s Grove,\r\nwhile he was inside a bar, waiting upon his patrons. The assassin\r\nescaped in the darkness.\r\n\r\nMany disturbances occurred in Mahanoy City, and an innocent citizen lost\r\nhis life, when a disturbance arose between William M. Thomas and James\r\nDugan. Both drew revolvers and fired at each other. Thomas was shot in\r\nthe face, but Christian Zimmerman, who was standing across the street,\r\nwaiting for his wife to complete her shopping, received a bullet through\r\nhis lungs and died the following afternoon. Thomas was arrested for\r\nassault on Dugan, but no one was arrested for killing Zimmerman. Another\r\nman was shot through the leg during this wild duel, and a rioter was\r\nstabbed during the excitement.\r\n\r\nMcKenna hurried to Mahanoy City where he found the country in a blaze of\r\nexcitement, and as the people believed him the worst Mollie Maguire in\r\nthe regions, he remained but a short time, when he took a train for\r\nShenandoah. He was in Shenandoah four hours when he learned who had\r\nfired the shot which killed Gomer James, and Tom Hurley became a refugee\r\nfrom justice.\r\n\r\nThe result of this unexpected success, was that all the Mollies in\r\nShenandoah engaged in grand bacchanal, and to get rid of them McKenna\r\nleft the place and went to Girardville. Here Jack Kehoe, one of the\r\nnotorious Mollie leaders told him in a moment of confidence, that the\r\nmurder of Squire Gwyther was the result of a drunken spree, and that\r\nThomas Love, he was glad to say, had made his escape.\r\n\r\nThis was truly Bloody Saturday, but by no means was it the end of the\r\nreign of the Mollie Maguires in the coal regions of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Yankees Drive Pennamites from Wyoming\r\n                      Valley in Battle Which Began\r\n                            August 15, 1771\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing the first massacre at Wyoming, October 15, 1763, it was more\r\nthan five years before the first forty settlers arrived from Connecticut\r\nto reclaim their improvements. On their arrival they found Amos Ogden\r\nand a few other persons in possession of the lands, occupying them by\r\nauthority of the Proprietary Government of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nNow commenced a bitter civil war, which lasted with alternate success of\r\nthe different parties for upwards of six years. The settlements of both\r\nparties were alternately broken up—the men led off to prison, the women\r\nand children driven away, and other outrages committed. Blood was often\r\nshed in this strange and civil strife.\r\n\r\nOgden and his little band were defeated, April 29, 1770, and the Yankees\r\nbecame the masters of the situation.\r\n\r\nThe Proprietaries of Pennsylvania raised a force in September, 1770,\r\nunder Captain Ogden, to recover Wyoming. Governor Penn issued a\r\nproclamation, June 28, 1770, directing all intruders to depart from\r\nWyoming.\r\n\r\nOgden planned a surprise attack and marching by way of Fort Allen,\r\ntraveled the Warrior’s Path, then but little used. The stratagem\r\nsucceeded, for the Yankees watched for them only along the regular path.\r\nOgden again proved his shrewdness by outwitting the Yankees, and\r\ndefeated them, capturing Major John Durkee, and others.\r\n\r\nOgden also captured Fort Durkee through a deception, and marched his\r\nprisoners off to Easton, where they were confined in jail. Major John\r\nDurkee, Major Simeon Draper and Captain Zebulon Butler, were put in\r\nirons and sent to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nFort Durkee remained in possession of the Pennamites until December 18,\r\n1770, when Captain Lazerus Stewart, and the “Paxtang Boys” surprised the\r\ngarrison, and captured the fort.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania authorities determined on the arrest of Captain\r\nStewart, and a warrant was placed in the hands of Captain Ogden. He\r\ncalled upon Sheriff Peter Kechlin, of Northampton County, and a posse\r\nreached Wyoming, January 18, 1771. Stewart refused to submit to arrest\r\nand in the short fight, Nathan Ogden, brother of the Captain, was killed\r\nand three others wounded.\r\n\r\nDuring the night Captain Stewart and forty of his men stole out of the\r\nfort and fled to the woods; the twelve remaining surrendered themselves\r\nto the sheriff. The death of his brother caused Captain Amos Ogden much\r\ndistress. The coroner’s inquest found that Nathan Ogden had been\r\nhorridly and wilfully murdered by Lazerus Stewart.\r\n\r\nFort Durkee was garrisoned by thirty Pennamites, when the sheriff,\r\nCaptain Ogden, Justice Charles Stewart, with their associates, January\r\n23, set out for Easton. Five of the ten prisoners taken at the capture\r\nof the fort were sent to Philadelphia and committed to jail, where Major\r\nDurkee and Captain Butler were still languishing. Those who escaped with\r\nCaptain Lazerus Stewart scattered and returned to their homes. Thus was\r\nconsummated the fifth expulsion of the Yankees from Wyoming.\r\n\r\nThe Pennamites in the two forts at Wilkes-Barre were reinforced by other\r\nPennsylvanians and Captain Amos Ogden and Charles Stewart, Esq. Fort\r\nWyoming was enlarged and strengthened and all the Pennamite settlers\r\ndwelt therein. Fort Durkee was abandoned and dismantled.\r\n\r\nDuring the next four months peace reigned supreme, and the Proprietaries\r\nhad much land surveyed in the Manors of Stoke and Sunbury, and laid out\r\nto various persons, under warrants of the Provincial Land Office.\r\n\r\nIn the mid-summer seventy men of Connecticut, formerly owners of land at\r\nWyoming, were enlisted under Captain Zebulon Butler to go forward to the\r\nmuch-coveted valley. While preparations were going on in Connecticut for\r\nthe Wyoming expedition Lazerus Stewart was gathering together a few of\r\nthe “Paxtang Boys,” who hastened to join Captain Butler on the march to\r\nWyoming.\r\n\r\nColonel Asher Clayton was the chief man among the Pennamites, who now\r\nseemed secure and thrifty. On July 6, news reached him that armed forces\r\nof Yankees were approaching, and scouts brought him intelligence that\r\nthe Yankees were determined to secure possession of this country.\r\nClayton went forward and met Butler, but they could not come to terms,\r\nand Clayton returned to the fort. Captain Butler and his men invested\r\nthe block house at Mill Creek and awaited developments.\r\n\r\nCaptain Amos Ogden again arrived at Wyoming and almost as soon as the\r\nYankees. He found the situation so serious that he determined to be his\r\nown messenger to Philadelphia, where he arrived July 16, in three days’\r\ntravel. He appeared before Provincial Council and related the story.\r\nThey agreed to raise 100 men and immediately set about to recruit them,\r\nbut met with unexpected difficulty.\r\n\r\nCaptain Butler did not wait for these reinforcements to reach the\r\nPennamites, but, Sunday, July 21, believed the time had come for the\r\noffensive. That night he silently marched them to the vicinity of Fort\r\nWyoming, where, before daylight he had entrenched. By Monday these\r\nintrenchments were occupied by Yankees and the battle for Fort Wyoming\r\nwas begun. Other redoubts were erected by which all communication with\r\nthe outside was cut off from Fort Wyoming, but the Pennamites possessed\r\nmeans of defense so long as their provisions and ammunition would hold\r\nout.\r\n\r\nReinforcements under Captains John Dick and Joseph Morris left their\r\nrendezvous in the Blue Mountains, Sunday, July 28, and arrived before\r\ndaybreak on the 30th. Within 200 yards of the block house they were\r\nattacked by the Yankees and lost two loads of flour and nine men. The\r\nYankees continued a constant fire, day and night, until August 10, the\r\ndefenders returning the fire.\r\n\r\nEfforts to send volunteers to the relief of the Pennamites were\r\nunavailing, until Ogden, Van Campen and others, who had extensive land\r\nclaims there, induced 62 men to march under command of Dr. Andrew Leslie\r\nfrom Reemeys, they arrived August 15, at “Ten-Mile Run,” where they\r\nbivouacked, after sending a messenger to the inmates of the fort.\r\n\r\nBut before the arrival of this detail and the supplies which they\r\nbrought, the garrison was nearly starved and on the 15th Colonel Clayton\r\nsent out a flag of truce, and after several consultations accepted the\r\nbest terms he could obtain. By the Articles of Capitulation 23 men were\r\nto march out armed, the remainder unarmed, and all to return to their\r\nhomes unmolested; men who had families could remain two weeks to collect\r\ntheir effects; and the sick and wounded could be cared for until able to\r\nleave. The Indian messenger from the relief party arrived just as the\r\nfort was surrendered.\r\n\r\nThus Wyoming was again in the possession of the settlers of the\r\nSusquehanna Company and Captain Zebulon Butler the hero of the hour.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Great Land Purchase Made at Indian Council\r\n                    in Philadelphia, August 16, 1749\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in April, 1749, the Six Nations held a Grand Council at Onondaga\r\nCastle, when it was decided to send deputies from each of the nations to\r\nPhiladelphia, to shake hands with Governor James Hamilton, who had\r\nassumed the office in the previous November; to answer a proposal for\r\npeace with the Catawba, which had been made by the former Governor of\r\nPennsylvania, and to consider other matters. It was agreed that all the\r\ndeputies should meet together at Wyoming, and proceed thence in a body\r\nto Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of May the four deputies of the Seneca accompanied by\r\nother members of their nation, arrived at Wyoming, where they waited a\r\nmonth for the arrival of the deputies of the other nations, who,\r\nhowever, failed to appear. The Seneca thereupon continued their journey\r\nvia the North Branch to Shamokin, then the main river, and arrived at\r\nPhiladelphia, June 26, accompanied by some Tutelo, Nanticoke and Conoy.\r\nThese Indians were received by the Governor and Council on July 1, when\r\nOgashtash, the Seneca speaker, stated that the Grand Council at Onondaga\r\nhad heard that the white people had begun to settle on the Indians’ side\r\nof the Blue Mountains, in the present Juniata Valley.\r\n\r\nOgashtash further said that during their stay at Wyoming they had heard\r\nthings which made them believe this was true. They wanted to know if\r\nthis was done wickedly by bad people or if the new Governor had brought\r\nsome instructions from the King, or Proprietaries, which the Grand\r\nCouncil did not yet know, but would cause much hurt.\r\n\r\nGovernor Hamilton informed the Seneca that the settling of the white\r\nsquatters along the Juniata was contrary to the terms of the treaties\r\nmade by the Government with the Indians, and that a proclamation would\r\nbe issued commanding all the white people who had settled north of the\r\nBlue Mountains to remove by November 1, 1749.\r\n\r\nPresents to the value of £100 were distributed on July 4 to the Indians,\r\nand a day or two later Conrad Weiser conducted them out of the city and\r\njourneyed with them as far as his house in Heidelberg Township. Here the\r\nIndians concluded to remain for a few days to visit with their old\r\nfriend and brother, and without invitation they camped out near his\r\nhouse and made themselves very much at home. The Tutelo injured and\r\ndestroyed a large amount of Weiser’s movable property and damaged his\r\nplantation generally. Weiser tried in vain to influence them to proceed\r\non their journey. Finally, after an unpleasant experience of a week or\r\nten days with these unruly visitors, Weiser induced the Seneca to take\r\ntheir departure, and they forced the Tutelo to go along.\r\n\r\nThe Tutelo were from villages on the West Branch of the Susquehanna.\r\nZeisberger speaks of this tribe as a “degenerate remnant of thieves and\r\ndrunkards”; he says that their village near Shamokin was “the only town\r\non the continent inhabited by Tutelos.”\r\n\r\nThese Indians loafed and loitered along the way to the Susquehanna,\r\ntaking along anything which struck their fancy, and when that stream was\r\nreached they paddled their canoes up the river, stopped awhile at\r\nShamokin, then at Nescopeck, then at Wyoming, where they arrived August\r\n1.\r\n\r\nTwo days after these Indians arrived at Wyoming, a large fleet of canoes\r\ncame unexpectedly down the North Branch bearing the belated deputies of\r\nthe Onondaga, Mohawk, Oneida, Cayuga and Tuscarora nations together with\r\nmany other representatives—chiefs, warriors, squaws and children of\r\nthese several nations, and many Indians of other tribes.\r\n\r\nThis large company remained at Wyoming for a day, and then proceeded\r\ndown the river, accompanied by the Seneca deputies, and their party, who\r\nhad just returned from Philadelphia, also by Chief Paxinosa and a large\r\nnumber of his Shawnee from their new home in what is now Plymouth,\r\nLuzerne County, and by a number of Delaware, Nanticoke and Mohican from\r\nthe different villages along their route. At Nescopeck they were joined\r\nby King Nutimus and a number of his people, and then, without further\r\ndelay, they floated down the river to Shamokin.\r\n\r\nArriving at this old Indian town at the Forks of the Susquehanna, now\r\nSunbury, a messenger was sent in haste over the mountains to Conrad\r\nWeiser to announce the coming of the deputies. Soon as Weiser received\r\nthis intelligence he dispatched an express to Governor Hamilton, who\r\nimmediately directed the messenger to hurry back to Weiser, who was\r\ninstructed by the Governor and Council “to try all ways to divert the\r\nIndians from coming to Philadelphia.” This the good old interpreter\r\ntried to do, but his efforts were resented by the Indians with so much\r\nspirit that he was obliged “to turn his protestations into invitations\r\nand make the best of circumstances.”\r\n\r\nWhen this small army of deputies reached Tulpehocken, Conrad Weiser\r\njoined them and was the leader of the party from there to Philadelphia,\r\nwhere they arrived August 14, and according to the official records they\r\nnumbered 280 in all. Governor Hamilton paid a ceremonious visit to the\r\nIndians, and appointed August 16 as the date for the conference with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSeveral days time of this conference was consumed in discussing the\r\nmatters which had brought the Indians to Philadelphia. As a result of\r\nthe conference the Proprietaries obtained for £500 a deed dated August\r\n22, 1749, for a strip of land northwest and contiguous to the Blue\r\nMountains, and extending from the Susquehanna to the Delaware River, the\r\nnorthwest boundary of this strip being a straight line running in a\r\nnortheasterly direction from the north side of the mouth of the\r\n“Cantagny or Maghonoy Creek,” and now known as Mahanoy Creek, a mile\r\nbelow the present city of Sunbury, “to the north side of the south of\r\nthe creek called Lechawachsein,” now Lackawaxon, which flows into the\r\nDelaware near the northern limit of Pike County; the southern boundary\r\nwas the mountain range, beginning near Dauphin and running in a\r\nnortheasterly direction until it falls into the Delaware River at the\r\npresent Delaware Water Gap.\r\n\r\nThis new purchase included all or parts of the present counties of\r\nDauphin, Northumberland, Lebanon, Schuylkill, Columbia, Carbon, Luzerne,\r\nMonroe, Pike and Wayne.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Robert Fulton, Native of Lancaster County,\r\n               Operates First Steamboat, August 17, 1807.\r\n\r\n\r\nRobert Fulton demonstrated the first successful commercial steam vessel\r\nAugust 17, 1807, when he opened the throttle and the Clermont slowly,\r\nbut surely, moved against the swift current of the Hudson River.\r\n\r\nRobert Fulton was born on a farm in Little Britain Township, Lancaster\r\nCounty, in 1765. His father was a native of Kilkenny, Ireland, and\r\nemigrated to Lancaster County in 1735, where he soon became one of the\r\nforemost citizens, but did not make a success of farming. A year after\r\nRobert’s birth he mortgaged the farm and moved to Lancaster, where he\r\ndied in 1768.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fulton was left with three daughters and two sons, and but little\r\nmoney and less time to spare to help meet the mortgage. She managed well\r\nwith her family but the farm was lost.\r\n\r\nThe boyhood of Robert was filled with a desire to express his feelings\r\nthrough the dual medium of painting and mechanics. He seemed to love\r\nboth with equal ardor.\r\n\r\nHis first great thrill came through the acquisition of some discarded\r\npaints and brushes brought to school one day by a companion. Fulton\r\naccomplished great things with them, and quite forgot he was in school\r\nto study.\r\n\r\nWhen Robert was thirteen, the citizens of Lancaster wished to light up\r\nthe town on the evening of July 4. It was in the midst of the Revolution\r\nand candles were as scarce as money. The demonstration was given up\r\nuntil Robert thought out a plan for skyrockets and the lad made possible\r\nthe celebration.\r\n\r\nIn Lancaster lived a clever man named William Henry, who had made some\r\nexperiments with a steamboat. Robert often visited the Henry home, and\r\nthere saw some pictures painted by Benjamin West, a former Chester\r\nCounty boy, who had gained great fame as an artist. Here was a man who\r\nappealed to young Fulton.\r\n\r\nRobert placed a paddle wheel on his rowboat after the Henry plan, but\r\npropelled it by hand. It is quite possible that he dreamed of the\r\ngreater speed if steam power could be applied.\r\n\r\nWhen Robert was seventeen his mother apprenticed him to a Philadelphia\r\nsilversmith. This was a mistake. He showed his character by quitting and\r\nestablishing himself as a miniature painter—work that he loved. His\r\nplain studio was at the corner of Second and Walnut Streets. Here he\r\nsupported himself for four years. He sketched and painted portraits and\r\nlandscapes, and made drawings of machinery. So well did he work that at\r\ntwenty-one he returned to Lancaster with enough money to buy a small\r\nfarm for his mother.\r\n\r\nFollowing the advice of some friends in 1786, he went to England, where\r\nhe devoted several years to his profession, under the tuition of\r\nBenjamin West, who received him into his own home. Here he became\r\nacquainted with the Duke of Bridgewater, the founder of the great canal\r\nsystem of Great Britain, who induced Fulton to abandon art, and take up\r\nthe study of mechanical science.\r\n\r\nFulton soon invented a double-inclined plane for raising or lowering\r\nboats from one level to another. In 1794 he devised a mill for sawing\r\nmarble. In 1796 he evolved the idea of cast iron aqueducts, and a\r\nstructure of this kind was built over the River Dee. He designed several\r\nbridges; he invented machinery for spinning flax; another for making\r\nropes; one for digging ditches, and a dispatch boat.\r\n\r\nIn 1796 he published a “Treatise on the Improvement of Canal\r\nNavigation,” copies of which were sent to President Washington, and\r\nother public officials, accompanied by letters telling of the advantages\r\nto be derived by canal navigation in America.\r\n\r\nFrom 1797 to 1804 he resided in Paris with Joel Barlow, the American\r\nrepresentative at the French court. During this period Fulton invented a\r\nsubmarine or plunging boat, called a “torpedo” designed to be used in\r\nnaval warfare. Bonaparte appointed a commission to examine it. Fulton\r\ncould easily descend to any depth, or rise to the surface. On one\r\noccasion he remained below the surface for four hours.\r\n\r\nThe French Government declined to patronize the project, and Fulton\r\naccepted the invitation from the English ministry, but would not agree\r\nto sell them a secret which the United States might need.\r\n\r\nIn 1806, after an absence of nineteen years, Fulton returned to the\r\nUnited States, and devoted his thought to the perfection of a steamboat,\r\na project which he had in his mind for many years.\r\n\r\nWhen in France Fulton met Robert R. Livingston, a rich man from New\r\nYork, who was much interested in steamboats. Livingston had already\r\nbuilt one, which proved a failure. The two men now joined forces. This\r\nmade a fine association for Fulton’s knowledge of machinery was far\r\ngreater than Livingston’s, but the latter had the wealth and influence\r\nwhich could bring an invention to the public.\r\n\r\nLivingston obtained the sole right for them to navigate the waters of\r\nNew York State for twenty years, if they could produce a steam vessel\r\ncapable of a speed of four miles an hour against the current of the\r\nHudson River.\r\n\r\nFulton finished his first steamboat in the Spring of 1807. He called it\r\nthe Clermont, which was the name of Livingston’s estate near Albany. The\r\nfirst trip from New York to Albany was made on Monday, August 17, 1807—a\r\nday that will never be forgotten.\r\n\r\nCrowds assembled at the wharf to see the Clermont start. Few believed it\r\nwould move; most called it “Fulton’s Folly.” The trip was even more\r\nsuccessful than Fulton had anticipated; it excited great admiration, and\r\nsteamboats were rapidly multiplied on American waters. The Clermont made\r\nregular trips between New York and Albany, at the rate of five miles per\r\nhour, but this speed was soon increased by improvements in the\r\nmachinery.\r\n\r\nThe success of the Clermont caused Fulton to construct other and larger\r\nboats and ferry boats. He also built the world’s first steam propelled\r\nwarship, in the War of 1812.\r\n\r\nIn 1806 he married Harriet, daughter of Walter Livingston, by whom he\r\nhad four children. He possessed great personal dignity and agreeable\r\nmanners, and many noble qualities of heart.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of his triumph and in the height of his prosperity he died.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1814–15 he was building a floating steam battery\r\nand visited the works at Paulus Hook, now Jersey City. He stood three\r\nhours in the cold, and then tramped through pools of water. He became\r\nill from this exposure, but again visited the construction, and died\r\nFebruary 24, 1815. The New York Legislature wore mourning six weeks. His\r\nfuneral was the largest ever held in New York City up to that time. The\r\nbody of this distinguished Pennsylvanian rests in Trinity churchyard on\r\nBroadway, at the head of Wall Street.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Anti-Masonic Outbreak in Pennsylvania\r\n                       First Felt at New Berlin,\r\n                            August 18, 1829\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom 1826 to 1838 may be termed the Anti-Masonic period, for during\r\nthose eventful years bigotry ran wild, while superstition and\r\nfanaticism, like the demons of old, took possession of the many. They\r\nwere the halcyon days for broken-down politicians to ride into power and\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nSeizing the opportunity, these demagogues originated a political party,\r\nwhose platform denounced all secret societies, particularly the\r\nFreemasons, as destructive of every principle of religion, justice and\r\ngood government.\r\n\r\nDuring the years 1823 to 1826 there resided in Western New York one\r\nWilliam Morgan, a native of Virginia, by trade a stone mason.\r\n\r\nIt has been represented that he was a veteran of the War of 1812, but he\r\nearned his title of Captain as the owner of a fishing smack, with\r\npiratical tendencies, which plied along the gulf coast.\r\n\r\nIn 1825 “Captain” Morgan was residing in Batavia, N. Y., where a poor\r\nprinter, named Wilbur, concocted with Morgan to publish a book\r\ncontaining the revelations of Freemasonry, which was in fact the copy of\r\na volume formerly published in England in 1750, under the title “Jachin\r\nand Boaz.”\r\n\r\nAs would be expected, the announcement of the publication of the book in\r\nquestion wrought up members of the Masonic fraternity to fever heat.\r\nEfforts to suppress the work were freely discussed, and some even\r\nproposed doing so by force if it could not be done otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe respectable part of the fraternity, supposing that no book of that\r\nkind would really be published, and, like a nine days’ wonder, if it\r\nwas, would soon vanish and wholly disappear, took little or no interest\r\nin the matter. While they were folding their arms, an inconsiderate\r\nscheme was developed by individuals for suppressing by force the\r\ncontemplated work.\r\n\r\nBut at this time Morgan was arrested for debt, September 12, 1826, and\r\nplaced in a carriage and driven to Rochester. That was the last ever\r\nseen of him.\r\n\r\nMorgan’s sudden disappearance caused great excitement, and gossips gave\r\nout the statement that Freemasons had conveyed him to Fort Niagara,\r\nwhile others claimed they had drowned him in Lake Ontario.\r\n\r\nPublic meetings were held and finally a reprobate named Edward Giddings\r\nspread the sensational story that Freemasons had abducted and foully put\r\nMorgan to death.\r\n\r\nAt this time the body of a man was washed ashore on Lake Ontario, and a\r\nweek after interment the body was exhumed and a second inquest\r\ndetermined that “William Morgan had come to his death by drowning.” The\r\ncorpse did not, in any particular, resemble Morgan, but the crowd\r\ndetermined that “it was a good enough Morgan until after election.” This\r\nbody was identified as that of Timothy Monroe, who had drowned September\r\n26. The remains were buried by his widow.\r\n\r\nThis should have ended the Morgan excitement but it did no such thing.\r\n“A lie well stuck to is more convincing than the truth.” So a most\r\ninfamous deception was practiced upon the people.\r\n\r\nProsecutions were instituted against those who were supposed to have\r\nanything to do with the abduction of Morgan. Many trials resulted, but\r\nno murder was ever established.\r\n\r\nWhat had become of Morgan? Was he drowned or murdered?\r\n\r\nAs early as September 26, 1826, the “Intelligencer,” of Harrisburg, as\r\nwell as other newspapers, cautioned the Masonic fraternity against “a\r\nman calling himself Captain Morgan, as he is a swindler and a dangerous\r\nman.”\r\n\r\nIt has been authentically settled that after the night of the so-called\r\nabduction, being threatened with numerous suits for debt and other\r\nmisdemeanors, Morgan left the country of his own free will, going\r\ndirectly to Australia, the passage money being furnished him. Arriving\r\nin that far distant clime, he established a newspaper, but died ten\r\nyears later. A son, who accompanied him, continued the business, and was\r\nliving just prior to our Civil War.\r\n\r\nThe Freemasons of New York State, as a body and individually, disclaimed\r\nall knowledge of any abduction of “Captain” Morgan.\r\n\r\nBy 1828 the Anti-Masonic movement had gained such impetus in New York\r\nthat a candidate for governor was placed on their ticket. Anti-Masonic\r\ntickets were named in Massachusetts, Vermont and Ohio.\r\n\r\nIn 1829 the storm broke out in Pennsylvania, and was first felt in the\r\nlittle town of New Berlin, Union County, where Lafayette Lodge No. 194\r\nwas holding a public procession August 18. The speakers for the occasion\r\nwere Hon. Jesse Merrill, General Henry Frick, Henry C. Eyer, Reverend\r\nJust Henry Fries, Reverend John Kessler and Reverend Henry Piggott.\r\nHenry W. and George A. Snyder, distinguished sons of former Governor\r\nSimon Snyder, were officers of the lodge and had arranged the program.\r\n\r\nThe meeting was broken up by the hostile action of a mob. It was these\r\nsame people who sent Ner Middlesworth, that great exponent of\r\nAnti-Masonry to the General Assembly; it was also in New Berlin where\r\nthe first Anti-Masonic newspapers were established.\r\n\r\nJoseph Ritner was placed in nomination for the office of Governor by the\r\nAnti-Masonic convention, which met in Harrisburg in 1829, and he\r\nreceived 51,000 votes, only 30,000 less than his successful opponent,\r\nGeorge Wolf.\r\n\r\nA national convention was held in Baltimore September, 1831, which\r\nplaced a complete ticket in the field. In 1832 the Anti-Masons of\r\nPennsylvania again placed Joseph Ritner in nomination, but he was again\r\ndefeated by Governor Wolf, but two years later the Anti-Masons gained\r\ncontrol of the Legislature, and under the capable leadership of Thaddeus\r\nStevens, made political history in the Keystone State.\r\n\r\nIn the election of October, 1835, Joseph Ritner was elected, and with\r\nboth branches of the General Assembly, the Anti-Masons were determined\r\nto carry out their various unlawful measures with a high hand.\r\n\r\nThe Stevens Legislative investigation held December, 1835, proved to be\r\na fiasco, as the inquisition failed to disclose a single unlawful act\r\nupon the part of any member of the order of Freemasons or Odd Fellows.\r\n\r\nBy 1838 the clouds of ignorant oppression had cleared away, and the\r\npeople, who cared to do so, could unite with either secret organization\r\nwithout fear of social ostracism or political suicide.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              York County and Its Part in the Revolution,\r\n                        Erected August 19, 1749\r\n\r\n\r\nYork County, erected August 19, 1749, from part of Lancaster County,\r\nplayed a conspicuous part and contributed its full share of troops\r\nduring the period of the early troubles of our Republic. Indeed York\r\nCounty seems to have been in the struggle from the earliest moment to\r\nthe end of the conflict and in addition furnished men who assumed a\r\nleading role in that stirring drama.\r\n\r\nColonel Thomas Hartley, himself one of the greatest patriots of the\r\nRevolutionary times, in a letter to President Reed, of the Supreme\r\nExecutive Council of Pennsylvania, says:\r\n\r\n“They knew they had been as patriotic as any, that the York district had\r\narmed the first in Pennsylvania, and had furnished more men in it than\r\nany other district on the continent of the same number of inhabitants.”\r\n\r\nAs early as December, 1774, James Smith, who was a Provincial statesman\r\nand sensed the impending struggle with the Mother Country, employed\r\nhimself in raising and drilling a volunteer company, of which he was\r\nelected captain. This is said to be the very first body of volunteer\r\nsoldiers organized in Pennsylvania, with a view to oppose the armies of\r\nGreat Britain. The officers were James Smith, captain; Thomas Hartley,\r\nfirst lieutenant; David Grier, second lieutenant, and Henry Miller,\r\nensign. Each of these officers, thus early attached to the cause of\r\nliberty, became distinguished in the subsequent history of the country.\r\n\r\nA company of riflemen was recruited in York County under the Resolution\r\nof Congress, June 14, 1775, which was attached to Thompson’s Riflemen,\r\nthe first command to receive commissions after General Washington. This\r\ncompany reached Cambridge, Mass., July 25, 1775, and was the first\r\ncompany to arrive there from any point south of Long Island or west of\r\nthe Hudson River. It got into action July 29, before all the regiment\r\nhad arrived.\r\n\r\nAnother rifle company was recruited in York County for fifteen months’\r\nservice, which marched from York early in May, 1776, and at Philadelphia\r\nbecame a part of Colonel Samuel Miles’ rifle regiment. In July five\r\nbattalions of militia marched from York County to New Jersey. Of these\r\nfive battalions two were formed and attached to the Flying Corps;\r\nColonel Michael Swope commanded the first battalion, and Colonel Richard\r\nMcAllister the second. Colonel Swope’s battalion suffered severe losses\r\nin battles of Long Island and Fort Washington. One company in this\r\nbattalion lost all but eighteen men at Long Island. Colonel Swope and\r\nfourteen of his officers were taken prisoners when Fort Washington fell\r\ninto the hands of the enemy November 16, 1776. Ensign Jacob Barnitz, of\r\nYork, was wounded in this battle and lay fifteen months in prison.\r\n\r\nToward the close of 1777, events occurred which brought York into\r\nprominence and made it for a time the capital of the now independent\r\nStates of America. The Continental Congress sat there for nine months,\r\nand at a time when its proceedings were of the greatest importance.\r\n\r\nThe disastrous Battle of Brandywine, fought September 11, 1777, decided\r\nthe fate of Philadelphia. On the approach of the British towards the\r\nSchuylkill, Congress adjourned to meet in Lancaster on September 27, and\r\non the same day adjourned to York. The Susquehanna was regarded as a\r\nsafe barrier between them and the enemy, and they began their sessions\r\nthere September 30, where they continued until the British evacuated\r\nPhiladelphia. The Congress left York June 27, 1778.\r\n\r\nOctober 17, 1777, Congress passed a Resolve, to procure a printing press\r\nso that the intelligence which Congress would receive from time to time\r\ncould be given to the public. The press of Hall and Sellers, of\r\nPhiladelphia, was set up in York, and even Continental money printed\r\nthere. This was the first printing press erected in Pennsylvania west of\r\nthe Susquehanna.\r\n\r\nOn November 15, Congress adopted the Articles of Confederation; on\r\nNovember 27, a new Board of War was organized. On December 1, Baron\r\nSteuben landed at Portsmouth, N. H., and started for York, where he\r\narrived February 5, 1778, and remained two weeks. He was received by\r\nCongress with every mark of distinction, and was appointed Inspector\r\nGeneral of the Army.\r\n\r\nThe treaty with France was ratified by Congress May 4, 1778, which was\r\nthe occasion for a general celebration.\r\n\r\nGeneral Gates resided in York during part of the time Congress met there\r\nand when Lafayette called upon him, he was surrounded by friends, seated\r\nabout the table and it was at this dinner the conspiracy was revealed to\r\nsupplant Washington and make Gates the Commander in Chief of the Army.\r\nIt was in York that General Gates and Colonel Wilkinson planned to fight\r\na duel to settle their differences, but before the meeting, their\r\ntroubles were adjusted.\r\n\r\nGeneral Wayne arrived in York February 27, 1781, on his way to assume\r\ncommand of part of the Pennsylvania Line which was to reinforce General\r\nGreene, then in the south. On May 20, Wayne’s corps, smaller in number\r\nthan he anticipated, and by no means well equipped, but reduced to\r\ndiscipline and harmony, marched southward from York.\r\n\r\nOn April 17, 1777, Congress changed the name of the “Committee of Secret\r\nCorrespondence,” to “Committee of Foreign Affairs,” and appointed Thomas\r\nPaine, secretary of the committee. His “American Crisis,” Number V.,\r\naddressed to General Sir William Howe, commenced in the house of Hon.\r\nWilliam Henry of Lancaster, was finished and printed at York.\r\n\r\nMajor John André, afterwards executed as a spy, was in York for a short\r\ntime after he was taken prisoner at St. John’s, September, 1775, and was\r\nfrom there transferred to Carlisle.\r\n\r\nGeneral Washington visited York in 1791, when he journeyed from Mount\r\nVernon to Philadelphia. He arrived in York from Hanover at 2 o’clock in\r\nthe afternoon of Saturday, July 2, 1791, and took lodging at the tavern\r\nof Baltzer Spangler. He was met with the Independent Light Infantry,\r\ncommanded by Captain George Hay, which fired a salute of fifteen rounds.\r\nHe had dinner with Colonel Thomas Hartley, and walked through the\r\nprincipal streets, and drank tea with his distinguished host.\r\n\r\nAt night there were illuminations and every other demonstration of joy.\r\nThe next morning his excellency was waited upon by the Chief Burgess and\r\nprincipal inhabitants, and was given an address, to which the President\r\nreplied. General Washington attended divine service and then proceeded\r\non his journey, being accompanied as far as Wright’s Ferry by a number\r\nof the principal inhabitants, among the latter being his close friend\r\nColonel Thomas Hartley.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Greatest Victory Over Indians Gained by\r\n                    General Wayne at Fallen Timbers,\r\n                            August 20, 1794\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the close of the Revolution the country west of the Ohio was still\r\noccupied with Indian tribes ever ready to bring devastation,\r\ndestruction, and desolation to the homes of the border settlers, and\r\never incited and aided by the British, who held a number of posts along\r\nthe lakes. The Indians had determined the Ohio River should be the\r\npermanent boundary between them and the United States.\r\n\r\nPresident Washington sent Generals Josiah Harmar and Arthur St. Clair in\r\nsuccession to command troops selected to overawe them, and each in turn\r\nexperienced bitter defeat by the savages. Washington then sent for\r\nGeneral Anthony Wayne and in April, 1782, placed him in command of the\r\nArmy of the United States.\r\n\r\nWayne understood his mission. He organized his “Legion” in Pittsburgh,\r\nJune, 1792, consisting of only 2,631 troops recruited from Pennsylvania,\r\nMaryland, Virginia and New Jersey. Pennsylvania furnished all but 232 of\r\nthe command.\r\n\r\nWayne inaugurated strict discipline. Two soldiers were shot down for\r\nsleeping on their posts. Whiskey was forbidden in the camp and\r\ndrunkenness severely punished. He insisted upon cleanliness and\r\nregularity of diet. He taught the use of the bayonet and the sword. He\r\ndined with his officers, and carefully planned every detail of his\r\nexpedition with their full knowledge.\r\n\r\nWayne had Chief Cornplanter, ninety Choctaw and twenty-five Chicasaw\r\nIndians with him, whom he used to sow dissension among the hostile\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nThe war lasted more than two years during which time there were periods\r\nof four and five months that he was without communication with the seat\r\nof government. The Government viewed this Indian war with alarm, and not\r\nwithout cause, as two previous defeats made the outcome doubtful.\r\n\r\nWhile the hostile Indians were perfecting their combinations the\r\nGovernment sent commissioners to Fort Erie to sue for peace. The result\r\nwas that the Indians gained the time they needed, then refused to treat\r\nat all, and the burden fell upon Wayne to see that the commissioners\r\nreached their homes with their scalps on their heads, for which they\r\nformally gave him thanks.\r\n\r\nOn October 13 he had marched to a point on the Miami River, eighty miles\r\nnorth of Cincinnati, where he found a camp which he fortified and called\r\nGreenville and remained there through the winter. From this camp he sent\r\nout scouts and spies to secure intelligence and scalps. He also sent a\r\nforce to the field where St. Clair had been defeated to bury the bones\r\nof the dead and erect a stockade called Fort Recovery.\r\n\r\nIn May a lieutenant with a convoy gallantly charged and repulsed an\r\nassault. About seventeen hundred of the enemy made a desperate attempt\r\nJune 13, to capture an escort under the walls of Fort Recovery and to\r\ncarry the Fort by storm, keeping up a heavy fire and making repeated\r\nefforts for two days, but were finally repulsed. Twenty-one soldiers\r\nwere killed and twenty-nine wounded.\r\n\r\nA few days later, after receiving reinforcements of mounted men from\r\nKentucky, General Wayne marched seventy miles in the heart of the Indian\r\ncountry, built Fort Defiance, and then within sight of a British fort on\r\nthe Miami River made his preparations for the battle which was\r\ninevitable.\r\n\r\nHe had marched nearly four hundred miles through the country of an\r\nenemy, both watchful and vindictive; had cut a road through the woods\r\nthe entire way, upon a route longer, more remote and more surrounded\r\nwith dangers than that of Braddock; had overcome almost insuperable\r\ndifficulties in securing supplies; had built three forts, and now had\r\nreached a position where the issue must be decided by arms.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of August 20, 1794, the army advanced five miles, with\r\nthe Miami on the right, a brigade of mounted volunteers on the left, a\r\nlight brigade in their rear, and a selected battalion of horsemen in the\r\nlead. They came to a place where a tornado had swept through the forest,\r\nand thrown down the trees, since called Fallen Timbers, and where the\r\ntwisted trunks and uprooted trees lay in such profusion as to impede the\r\nmovements of the cavalry.\r\n\r\nHere the Indians, two thousand in number, encouraged by the proximity of\r\nthe British fort, determined to make a stand. Hidden in the woods and\r\nthe high grass, they opened fire upon the mounted men in front and\r\nsucceeded in driving them back to the main army. The enemy were formed\r\nin three lines in supporting distance of each other, extending two miles\r\nat right angles to the river and were protected and covered by the\r\nwoods.\r\n\r\nWayne formed his force in two lines. He saw the enemy was strong in\r\nnumbers and intended to turn his flank, and met this situation by\r\nordering up the rear line to support the first, by sending a force by a\r\ncircuitous route to turn the right of the enemy; by sending another\r\nforce at the same time along the river to turn their left, and by a\r\ndirect charge in the front to drive the Indians from their covert with\r\nthe bayonet.\r\n\r\nThe Indians could not stand this attack, broke in confusion, and were\r\ndriven two miles in the course of an hour through the woods with great\r\nloss. Their dead bodies and the British muskets lay scattered in all\r\ndirections. All of the village, corn fields and houses, including that\r\nof Alexander McKee, the British Indian agent, within a scope of one\r\nhundred miles were burned and destroyed.\r\n\r\nAmerican annals disclose no such other victory over the savage tribes.\r\nIt secured for civilization the territory between the Ohio and\r\nMississippi Rivers. It made possible the development of such states as\r\nOhio, Indiana and Illinois.\r\n\r\nWhen the news reached London, the British Government, recognizing that\r\nthe cause of the Indians was hopeless, ordered the evacuation of the\r\nposts at Detroit, Oswego and Niagara.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks later General Wayne was crushed to earth by a falling tree, so\r\nmuch bruised as to cause great pain and hemorrhages, and only the\r\nfortunate location of a stump, on which the tree finally rested, saved\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\nAfter the treaty of cession and peace had been executed, and after an\r\nabsence in the wilderness for three years, he returned home in 1795,\r\neverywhere hailed with loud acclaim as the hero of the time and received\r\nin Philadelphia by the City Troop and with salvos from cannon, ringing\r\nof bells and fireworks.\r\n\r\nHis last battle had been fought. His work was done. “Both body and mind\r\nwere fatigued by the contest,” were his pathetic words. Soon afterwards\r\nthe President sent him as a commissioner to Detroit and on his return he\r\ndied at Presque Isle, now Erie, December 15, 1796.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Chief Tedyuskung Annoys Moravian Brethren;\r\n                          Arrives at Bethlehem\r\n                            August 21, 1756\r\n\r\n\r\nTedyuskung, the great king of the Delaware tribe and one of the most\r\npowerful of the Indian sachems in Pennsylvania, much enjoyed the\r\nprominence he gained by frequent councils and conferences with the\r\nGovernor and other Provincial dignitaries, even at the expense of\r\ncausing a great jealousy among Indian chiefs of other nations. He was a\r\nskilled diplomat, a good speaker and a friend of the English, yet he was\r\nrather crafty in his dealings with both the whites and his own race, and\r\nwas given over to excessive intemperance.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the great treaty held at Easton, July 24–31, 1756,\r\nthe Governor and others in authority doubted the sincerity of\r\nTedyuskung, but he satisfied them on that score, and during August\r\nremained almost constantly in or about Fort Allen on a drunken debauch.\r\nFinally on August 21, he removed with his retinue to Bethlehem, where\r\nhis wife, Elizabeth, and her three young children determined to remain,\r\nwhile the King went on an expedition to the Minisinks to put a stop to\r\nsome Indian depredations.\r\n\r\nTedyuskung went from there to Wyoming and sent word to Major Parsons, at\r\nEaston, that he wanted his wife and children sent to him. Major Parsons\r\nwent immediately to Bethlehem and made known the King’s desire to his\r\nwife, but she decided to remain where she was. This then was the cause\r\nof frequent visits to Bethlehem, where Tedyuskung much annoyed the\r\nMoravian Brethren, who were not in position to control his actions when\r\nhe was their unwelcome visitor.\r\n\r\nJuly, 1757, he was for some time in and about Fort Allen and then in\r\nattendance at the second great conference at Easton, during which time\r\nhis wife and children were with him. Two days after this conference\r\nclosed Tedyuskung, his family and others went to Bethlehem. Reichel, in\r\nhis “Memorials of the Moravian Church,” says:\r\n\r\n“Some of these unwelcome visitors halted for a few days, and some\r\nproceeded as far as Fort Allen and then returned, undecided as to where\r\nto go and what to do. During the month full 200 were counted—men, women\r\nand children—among them lawless crowds who annoyed the Brethren by\r\ndepredations, molested the Indians at the Manakasy, and wrangled with\r\neach other over their cups at ‘The Crown’.”\r\n\r\nTedyuskung tarried in Bethlehem several days when he set out on a\r\nmission to Tioga, but on the way he was met by messengers from the Ohio\r\nIndians, who bore such glad tidings that the King determined he should\r\ngo to Philadelphia and appraise the Governor and Council of the good\r\nnews.\r\n\r\nAt Bethlehem Tedyuskung spent a few days with his wife and family,\r\nmeantime holding a conference with Bishop Spangenberg, Reverend Mack and\r\nother Moravian Brethren—Augustus, the christianized Delaware chief\r\nserving as interpreter. Tedyuskung inquired of the Moravians why the\r\nconverted Indians could not move to Wyoming. Bishop Spangenberg told him\r\nthey would require a town of their own, where a school and church could\r\nbe built. The king said these should be built there.\r\n\r\nHe then surprised the Brethren by telling them that reports had been\r\ncirculated among the Indians that the Moravians had decapitated the\r\nIndians among them, placed their heads in bags and sent them to\r\nPhiladelphia. These charges had so exasperated the Indians that they\r\nconspired to attack the Brethren’s settlements and cut off the\r\ninhabitants without regard to age or sex. He and Paxinoso had on one\r\noccasion persuaded 200 warriors, who had banded together for this\r\npurpose, to desist from their design.\r\n\r\nAfter his interview with the Governor and Council in Philadelphia,\r\nTedyuskung returned to Bethlehem, where he remained with his wife and\r\nchildren until October 7 when he again went to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nDuring all her sojourn in Bethlehem the King’s wife was maintained by\r\nthe Moravian Brethren at the expense of the Province. Tedyuskung was\r\nback in Bethlehem in about ten days and remained until the 27th, when\r\nthey set out for Wyoming, where the Commissioners were daily expected to\r\nbuild a fort and some houses for the Delaware.\r\n\r\nHaving previously signified to the Moravian Brethren at Bethlehem his\r\ndesire to spend the winter at Bethlehem, permission for him and his\r\nfamily to do so was reluctantly granted. Thereupon, upon his return from\r\nNew Jersey, a lodge was built for him near “The Crown” inn. There he\r\nheld court and gave audience to the wild embassies that would come from\r\nthe Indian country.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Tedyuskung and his family nearly one hundred Indians\r\nspent the winter of 1757–58 in the neighborhood of “The Crown.” Reichel\r\nsays: “Government was imposing an additional burden upon the Brethren\r\nwhen it committed this lawless crowd to their keeping * * * We are at a\r\nloss how to act. Furthermore, we are told that some of our neighbors are\r\ngrowing uneasy at our receiving such murdering Indians, as they style\r\nthem. I fear we shall be obliged to set watches to keep such of them off\r\nas are disposed to quarrel with, or may attempt to hurt any of them.”\r\n\r\nTedyuskung attended a long conference in Philadelphia in the early part\r\nof 1758, and made trips to and from Bethlehem for this purpose.\r\n\r\nHe was back in Bethlehem in April, and on the 17th sent a number of the\r\nDelaware, who had wintered in the Moravian town, to Fort Allen, there to\r\njoin Captain Jacob Arndt’s soldiers in ranging the frontiers. He also\r\nsent his sons, Captains John Jacob and Amos and three other Delaware\r\nover the Allegheny to the Indians towns of the Delaware and Shawnee.\r\n\r\nTedyuskung remained in Bethlehem, and Justice Horsfield wrote on April\r\n18: “I never before was so much convinced of Tedyuskung’s zeal for the\r\nEnglish cause.” Five days later, however, a soldier came to Bethlehem\r\nfrom Fort Allen with a letter from Captain Arndt in which he stated that\r\nhe was having trouble with the Indians sent to the fort by\r\nTedyuskung—the messengers, who were still there, as well as those who\r\nwere to range being continually drunk, having brought with them some\r\ncasks of rum from Easton.\r\n\r\nTedyuskung made another trip to Philadelphia in May to urge the Governor\r\nto again send the Commissioners to finish the fort and the houses. He\r\nreturned to Bethlehem about May 8.\r\n\r\nReichel says: “When the swelling of the maple buds and the whitening of\r\nthe shad-bush on the river’s bank betokened the advent of Spring, there\r\nwere busy preparations going on in Tedyuskung’s company over the matter\r\nof their long-expected removal to the Indian Eldorado on the flats of\r\nthe Winding River. It was the 16th of cornplanting month (May), the\r\nmonth called Tauwinipen, when the Delaware King, his Queen, his\r\ncounsellors and his warriors led by the Commissioners, took up the line\r\nof march for Fort Allen, beyond there to strike the Indian trail that\r\nled over the mountains to Wyoming Valley—and on the going out of these\r\nspirits ‘The Crown’ was swept and garnished and Ephriam Colver, the\r\npublican, had rest.”\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             Gilbert Family in Indian Captivity Twenty-nine\r\n                     Months Released August 22,1782\r\n\r\n\r\nBenjamin Gilbert and family, living on Mahoning Creek, about five miles\r\nfrom Fort Allen, now Weissport, Carbon County, were carried into a\r\nbitterly painful captivity by a party of Indians, who took them to\r\nCanada, and there separated them. At the time of this occurrence, April\r\n25, 1780, the event caused intense excitement throughout the State, and\r\nfrom an interesting narrative published shortly after their release from\r\ncaptivity, August 22, 1782, the following facts are ascertained.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Gilbert was a Quaker from Byberry, near Philadelphia, and in\r\n1775 removed with his family to a farm on Mahoning Creek, near Fort\r\nAllen. They lived comfortably in a good log dwelling house, with barn\r\nand saw and grist mill. For five years all was peace and industry.\r\n\r\nOn the eventful day, about sunrise they were surprised by a party of\r\nIndians who took the following prisoners: Benjamin Gilbert, aged 69;\r\nElizabeth, his wife, 55 years; sons, Joseph, aged 41; Jesse, 19; Abner,\r\n14; and daughters, Rebecca, 16; and Elizabeth, 12; and Sarah, wife of\r\nJesse; Thomas Peart, son of Benjamin Gilbert’s wife; Benjamin Gilbert, a\r\nnephew of the elder Gilbert; Andrew Harrigar, a German servant and\r\nAbigail Dodson, a neighbor’s daughter, the whole number taken being\r\ntwelve. The Indians then proceeded about half a mile to Benjamin Peart’s\r\nand there captured himself and his wife and their nine months’ old\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nThe last look the poor captives had of their once comfortable homes was\r\nto view the buildings in flames as they were led over Summer Hill, on\r\ntheir way over Mauch Chunk and Broad Mountains into the Nescopeck Path,\r\nand then across Quakake Creek to Mahanoy Mountain, where they passed the\r\nfirst night, fastened between notched saplings, with straps around their\r\nnecks and fastened to a tree.\r\n\r\nTheir march was resumed soon after dawn and day after day they tramped\r\nover the wild and rugged region between the Lehigh and the Chemunk\r\nbranch of the Susquehanna. Often ready to faint by the way, the cruel\r\nthreat of instant death urged them again to march. The old man, Benjamin\r\nGilbert, had begun to fail, and was already painted black, the fatal\r\nomen among the Indians; but when they were to kill him, the pitiful\r\npleadings of his wife saved him. Subsequently in Canada, Gilbert told\r\nthe chief he could say what none of the other Indians could, “that he\r\nhad brought in the oldest man and the youngest child.”\r\n\r\nOn the fifty-fourth day of their captivity, the Gilbert family had to\r\nexperience the fearful ordeal of running the gauntlet.\r\n\r\n“The prisoners,” says the narrative, “were released from the heavy loads\r\nthey had heretofore been compelled to carry, and were it not for the\r\ntreatment they expected on approaching the Indian towns, and the\r\nhardship of separation, their situation would have been tolerable; but\r\nthe horror of their minds, arising from the dreadful yells of the\r\nIndians as they approached the hamlets, is easier conceived than\r\ndescribed—for they were no strangers to the customary cruelty exercised\r\nupon the captives on entering their towns. The Indians, men, women and\r\nchildren, collect together, bringing clubs and stones in order to beat\r\nthem, which they usually do with great severity. The blows must be borne\r\nwithout complaint. The prisoners are beaten until the Indians weary with\r\nthe cruel sport.\r\n\r\n“Two of the women who were on horseback were much bruised by falling\r\nfrom their horses, which were frightened by the Indians. Elizabeth, the\r\nmother, took shelter by the side of a warrior, who sent her away, she\r\nthen received several violent blows, so that she was almost disabled.\r\nThe blood trickled from their heads in a stream. Their hair being\r\ncropped close and the clothes they had on in rags, made their situation\r\ntruly piteous. Whilst the Indians were inflicting this revenge upon the\r\ncaptives, the chief came and put a stop to any further cruelty.”\r\n\r\nSoon after this torture, a severer trial awaited them, when they were\r\nseparated. Some were given over to other Indians to be adopted, others\r\nwere hired out as servants, and the remainder were sent down the lake to\r\nMontreal. Among the latter was old Benjamin Gilbert, by this time broken\r\nin body and mind, and he there succumbed. His remains were interred near\r\nold Fort Coeur du Lac, below Ogdensburg.\r\n\r\nSome of the family met with kind treatment from the hands of British\r\nofficers, who were interested in their story, and exerted themselves to\r\nrelease them from captivity. Sarah Gilbert, wife of Jesse, became a\r\nmother, and Elizabeth Gilbert was allowed to give her daughter every\r\nnecessary attendance. One day while Elizabeth was ironing for the family\r\nof Adam Scott, a little girl told her some one wanted to see her and\r\nupon entering another room, she found six of her own children. A\r\nmessenger was sent to inform Jesse and his wife, so that Joseph Gilbert,\r\nBenjamin Peart and Elizabeth, his wife, and their young child, and Abner\r\nand Elizabeth Gilbert the younger, were with their mother on this\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Gilbert, the younger, only twelve years of age, had been\r\nadopted by an Indian family, but was permitted to live with a white\r\nfamily named Secord, by whom she was treated with endearing attention.\r\n\r\nA year later Mr. Secord took Betsy on a trip to Niagara, and there she\r\nsaw six of her relatives, most of whom had been released and were\r\npreparing to leave for Montreal, perhaps never again to see the others.\r\nThe sight of their beloved little sister roused every energy to effect\r\nher release, which desire was generously seconded by John Secord and the\r\nTory leader, Colonel John Butler, who, soon after her visit to Niagara\r\nsent for the Indian who claimed Elizabeth as his child and made\r\novertures for her ransom. At first he declared that he “would not sell\r\nhis own flesh and blood,” but, attacked through his interest, or in\r\nother words, his necessities, the negotiation succeeded and her youngest\r\nchild was among the treasures first restored to the mother at Montreal.\r\n\r\nEventually they were all released and collected at Montreal and on\r\nAugust 22, 1782, they took leave of their friends there and returned to\r\nByberry, after a captivity of two years and five months.\r\n\r\nThe premises where stood the dwelling and improvements of the Gilbert\r\nfamily were on the north side of Mahoning Creek, on an elevated bank\r\nabout forty perches from the main road leading from Lehighton and\r\nWeissport to Tamaqua, and about four miles from the former. Benjamin\r\nPeart lived about a mile farther up the creek, and about a quarter of a\r\nmile from it on the south side.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Alexander Wilson, the Great American\r\n                  Ornithologist, Died at Philadelphia,\r\n                            August 23, 1813\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexander Wilson, the great American ornithologist, was born in Paisley,\r\nScotland, July 6, 1766, and died in Philadelphia, August 23, 1813. He\r\nwas the son of a distiller, but at the age of thirteen was apprenticed\r\nto a weaver, and after seven years abandoned the loom and adopted the\r\nlife of a peddler.\r\n\r\nThree years were thus spent and in 1789, having prepared a volume of\r\npoems for publication, he offered his muslins and solicited\r\nsubscriptions for this work. It was published in 1790, but had little\r\nsuccess; and he again returned to the loom.\r\n\r\nIn 1792 he published “Watty and Meg,” which having appeared anonymously,\r\nwas ascribed to Robert Burns though the style is very different. It is\r\nsaid to have had a sale of 100,000 copies in a few weeks. He wrote a\r\nsevere satire upon a person in Paisley and was thrown into prison, and\r\nwas afterwards compelled to burn the libel with his own hand at Paisley\r\nCross. Upon his release, he resolved to emigrate, and arrived at New\r\nCastle, Delaware, July 14, 1794, with only a few borrowed shillings,\r\nwithout an acquaintance, and with no decided purpose.\r\n\r\nAfter working at various trades, sometimes as a copperplate printer\r\nunder Alexander Lawson, in which he showed both ambition and talent, he\r\nwent through New Jersey as a peddler and during this journey seems to\r\nhave first paid minute attention to the habits and appearance of birds.\r\n\r\nHe afterward taught school at various places in New Jersey and\r\nPennsylvania, finally settling in 1802 at Kingsessing on the Schuylkill.\r\n\r\nOne of the schools he taught was situated on the Darby Road, a short\r\ndistance west of the intersection with Gray’s Ferry Road. His home was\r\nnear the celebrated botanical garden of William Bartram, and he became\r\nacquainted with the famous naturalist, who, by his own love of birds,\r\ndeeply interested young Wilson in that branch of nature. It was at this\r\ntime that Alexander Wilson resolved to form a collection of all the\r\nbirds of America.\r\n\r\nHis first excursion, October, 1804, was to Niagara Falls. He walked from\r\nPhiladelphia through the unopened wilderness of western New York, and\r\nwrote a metrical description of his journey in the “Port Folio” under\r\nthe title of “The Foresters, a Poem.”\r\n\r\nElsewhere Wilson wrote:\r\n\r\n             “Sweet flows the Schuylkill’s winding tide,\r\n               By Bartram’s green emblossomed bowers,\r\n             Where nature sports in all her pride,\r\n               Of choicest plants and fruits and flowers.”\r\n\r\nWilson learned drawing, coloring, and etching from Alexander Lawson, the\r\ncelebrated engraver, whose tastes and instructions stimulated his own\r\ntalents.\r\n\r\nHe persuaded Bradford, a Philadelphia publisher, who had employed him in\r\n1806, in editing the American edition of Rees’s Cyclopedia, to furnish\r\nfunds for an American ornithology on an adequate scale. The first volume\r\nof this work appeared in September, 1808, but it was too expensive to be\r\nvery successful. The seventh volume appeared in 1813.\r\n\r\nThe interval had been passed in exploring different parts of the country\r\nfor the purpose of extending his observations, collecting specimens and\r\nwatching the habits of birds in their native haunts.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1810, the second volume appeared, but before the next was\r\nprepared Wilson sailed down the Ohio River in a small boat as far as\r\nLouisville, he set out on horseback from Nashville for New Orleans in\r\nMay, 1811, and arrived June 6. Sailing from there he arrived back in\r\nPhiladelphia in August, and began the third volume.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1812, he started on another tour of the eastern States. He\r\ncompleted the publication of seven volumes.\r\n\r\nIn 1813 the literary materials for the eighth volume of the\r\n“Ornithology” were ready, but its progress was greatly retarded for want\r\nof proper assistants to color the plates. Wilson was therefore obliged\r\nto undertake the whole of this department himself in addition to his\r\nother duties. He employed himself so unceasingly in the preparation of\r\nhis work that he impaired his already weakened condition and hastened\r\ndeath. It is said that in his eagerness to obtain a rare bird, he swam\r\nacross a river and caught cold from which he never recovered.\r\n\r\nAll the plates for the remainder of his work having been completed under\r\nWilson’s own eye the letter press work on the ninth volume was supplied\r\nby his friend, George Ord, his companion in several of his expeditions,\r\nwho also wrote a memoir of Wilson to accompany the last volume, and\r\nedited the eighth. Four supplementary volumes were afterwards added by\r\nCharles Lincoln Bonaparte.\r\n\r\nAn edition of Alexander Wilson’s poems was published at Paisley in 1816,\r\nand another at Belfast in 1857. A statue of him was erected at Paisley\r\nin October, 1874.\r\n\r\nWilson was followed by another Pennsylvanian, John James Audubon, who\r\nlived for many years on the Perkiomen near its mouth. He published an\r\nimmense work upon the “Birds of America,” which brought him lasting\r\nfame. Thus the two greatest ornithologists of America are claimed as\r\nresidents of our state.\r\n\r\nIn the quiet retreat of the churchyard of the old Swedes Church, or\r\n“Gloria Dei,” at Weccacoe, where he delighted to worship, repose the\r\nremains of Alexander Wilson. The distinguished ornithologist requested\r\nto be laid to rest there, as it was “a silent, shady place where the\r\nbirds would be apt to come and sing over his grave.”\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Governor Snyder Calls on Pennsylvania\r\n                   When British Burn National Capitol\r\n                            August 24, 1814\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1813 the shores of the Chesapeake and its tributary\r\nrivers were made a general scene of ruin and distress. The British\r\nforces assumed the character of the incendiary in retaliation for the\r\nburning of the town of York, in Upper Canada, which had been taken by\r\nthe American army under General Dearborn in April of that year. The\r\nburning of York was accidental, but its destruction served as a pretext\r\nfor the general pillage and conflagration which followed the marching of\r\nthe British army.\r\n\r\nThe enemy took possession of Washington August 24, 1814, and the\r\ncommanders of the invading force, General Ross and Admiral Blackburn,\r\nproceeded in person to direct and superintend the business of burning\r\nthe Capitol and city.\r\n\r\nOn August 26, Governor Simon Snyder issued a strong appeal for a call to\r\narms: “The landing upon our shores, by the enemy, of hordes of\r\nmarauders, for the purpose avowedly to create by plunder, burning and\r\ngeneral devastation, all possible individual and public distress, gives\r\nscope for action to the militia of Pennsylvania by repelling that foe,\r\nand with just indignation seek to avenge the unprovoked wrongs heaped on\r\nour unoffending country.\r\n\r\n“The militia generally within the counties of Dauphin, Lebannon, Berks,\r\nSchuylkill, York, Adams and Lancaster, and that part of Chester County\r\nwhich constitutes the Second Brigade of the Third Division, and those\r\ncorps particularly, who, when danger first threatened, patriotically\r\ntendered their services in the field, are earnestly invited to rise (as\r\non many occasions Pennsylvania has heretofore done) superior to local\r\nfeeling and evasives that might possibly be drawn from an imperfect\r\nmilitary system, and to repair with that alacrity which duty commands,\r\nand it is fondly hoped inclination will prompt, to the several places of\r\nbrigade or regimental rendezvous that shall respectively be designated\r\nby the proper officer, and thence to march to the place of general\r\nrendezvous.\r\n\r\n“Pennsylvanians, whose hearts must be gladdened at the recital of the\r\ndeeds of heroism achieved by their fellow citizens, soldiers now in arms\r\non the Lake frontier, and within the enemy’s country, now the occasion\r\nhas occurred, will with order seek and punish that same implacable foe,\r\nnow marauding on the Atlantic shore of two of our sister States.”\r\n\r\nCamps were established at Marcus Hook, on the Delaware, and at York. At\r\nthe latter place 5,000 men were soon under the command of Major General\r\nNathaniel Watson, and Brigadier Generals John Forster and John Adams.\r\n\r\nWhen General Ross attempted the capture of Baltimore, these Pennsylvania\r\nmilitia marched thither and had the high honor to aid in repelling the\r\nenemy. In the same year other of the State’s military forces rendered\r\nexcellent services at Chippewa and Bridgewater, and thereby won the\r\ngratitude of the people of the entire country.\r\n\r\nDuring the entire war the soil of Pennsylvania had never been trodden by\r\na hostile foot, yet it had at one time a greater number of militia and\r\nvolunteers in the service of the United States than were at any time in\r\nthe field from any other state in the Union, and as she furnished more\r\nmen, so did she furnish more money to carry on the war.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of Ghent was concluded December 24, 1814, but the closing\r\nacts in the tragedy of the war were the battle of New Orleans, January\r\n8, 1815, and the gallant capture of the British warships “Cyane” and\r\n“Levant,” by Captain Charles Stewart’s grand old frigate,\r\n“Constitution,” February 20, 1815.\r\n\r\nOn February 17, 1815, the treaty of peace between the United States and\r\nGreat Britain was ratified by the Senate.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania’s finances were in such sound condition that only one small\r\ntemporary loan was required to pay all expenditures incurred during the\r\nwar. Business did not suffer, yet during the war period a cloud was\r\ngathering which soon was to have a serious effect on the financial\r\nsituation in the State. The United States Bank, after twenty years of\r\nhonorable and useful life, came to an end in 1811, and at a time when\r\nits services were needed by the government and the people.\r\n\r\nThe State banks were envious of the power of the larger institution, and\r\nin the failure to renew its charter their officers saw the opportunity\r\nto advance their personal ends.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature chartered State banks over the Governor’s veto, and\r\nagain the State was flooded with paper money, as it had been during the\r\nRevolution, but the terrible consequences of that deluge had long since\r\nbeen forgotten. The excess of issue and lack of faith in them was soon\r\nreflected by rising prices. The banks had little or no specie for\r\nredeeming their notes. Soon many banks were without funds, hence were\r\ncompelled to close their doors, and both the promoters and their victims\r\nwere led into financial ruin.\r\n\r\nGovernor Snyder’s great friend, Editor John Binns, had the courage to\r\nmaintain that, although individuals were thus made bankrupt, the State\r\nwas benefited by the results of the banking acts, for, says he: “The\r\ntitles to lands became more clear, settled and certain; strangers were\r\ninduced to purchase and come to Pennsylvania and settle.” Quite a costly\r\nway to clear titles.\r\n\r\nThe downfall of the banking system was followed by general depression,\r\nand many men and business institutions were forced into involuntary\r\nbankruptcy. This was an unfortunate period in Pennsylvania history, and\r\nwas not a condition single to this State alone.\r\n\r\nNormal conditions were eventually restored and then followed an era of\r\nprogress which was not marred for many years.\r\n\r\nThroughout all this trying period Governor Snyder exhibited many\r\nsplendid traits of character, and met every emergency with determined\r\ncourage. He was not always able to control the Legislature, and his\r\nconduct in trying to stay the deluge of paper money was one of the most\r\nnoteworthy of his three successful administrations.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                British Destroy Moravian Indian Town on\r\n                  Order of De Peyster, August 25,1781\r\n\r\n\r\nColonel Daniel Brodhead had been sent with his Eighth Pennsylvania\r\nRegiment to the Western frontier, and as most of the soldiers in this\r\nrenowned command had been recruited in that part of the State this\r\nassignment was gladly received. The men could do double duty by serving\r\ntheir country and at the same time assist in protecting their own homes.\r\n\r\nBut all did not go well for Brodhead. He was a great soldier and knew\r\nhow to fight Indians, but was remiss in other matters and soon got into\r\ntrouble with the Supreme Executive Council, on account of becoming\r\ninvolved in quarrels with officers and civilians.\r\n\r\nCongress selected Brigadier General William Irvine, of Carlisle, to\r\nsucceed Colonel Brodhead in the command of the Western Department,\r\nSeptember 24, 1781, and he repaired to that post of duty.\r\n\r\nColonel J. W. de Peyster, the British commandant at Detroit, who\r\nbelieved the presence of the Moravian missionaries along the Tuscarawas\r\nRiver had seriously interfered with prosecution of the war, ordered\r\ntheir removal to the Sandusky Valley, where they were planted amid the\r\nvillages of the hostile Wyandot and Shawnee.\r\n\r\nOn August 25, 1781, he sent Captain Matthew Elliott, the Tory officer,\r\nwith a small party of Tories and French-Canadians, and 250 savages,\r\nincluding Wyandot under Dunquat, Delaware under Captain Pipe, and a few\r\nShawnee to carry his order into effect. Elliott performed his errand\r\nwith unnecessary brutality.\r\n\r\nThe missionaries and their converts claimed a strict neutrality, but did\r\nnot observe it. Bishop Zeisberger and Reverend Heckewelder were secretly\r\nthe friends of the Americans and conducted a regular clandestine\r\ncorrespondence with the officers at Fort Pitt, giving valuable\r\ninformation of the movements of the British and hostile savages. This\r\nwas suspected by Colonel de Peyster and he ordered the Moravians to move\r\nnearer Detroit. The hostile Indians threatened the converts with\r\ndestruction because they would not join in the war, while many borderers\r\nbelieved these Indians did occasionally participate in raids upon the\r\nsettlements. The settlers did not take much stock in the Christianity of\r\nthe Moravian Indians.\r\n\r\nTo save the Moravians from dangers on both sides, Colonel Brodhead\r\nadvised them to take up their residence near Fort Pitt, but they refused\r\nto heed his warning. These converts remained between the two fires, but\r\nZeisberger and Heckewelder were blind to their imminent peril.\r\n\r\nThe Moravian Indians numbered about one hundred families in their three\r\nvillages of Schoenbrun, Gnadenhuetten, and Salem. Their homes were log\r\ncabins, with vegetable gardens and cultivated fields, and fine herds of\r\ncattle, hogs and many horses.\r\n\r\nElliott seized and confined the missionaries and their families and\r\ngathered them and all the converted Indians at Gnadenhuetten. They were\r\nmarched from there September 11, leaving behind their great stock of\r\ncorn and many effects. The sad procession descended the Tuscarawas to\r\nits junction with the Walhonding and passed up the latter stream to its\r\nsource, thence over the dividing ridge to the Sandusky.\r\n\r\nBy the time the Moravians had reached the Sandusky they had been robbed\r\nof their best blankets and cooking vessels and their food was about\r\nexhausted. On the east side of the stream, about two miles above the\r\nsite of Upper Sandusky, they settled down in poverty and privation,\r\nbuilt rude shelters of logs and bark and spent the winter in great\r\ndistress.\r\n\r\nIn March the missionaries were again taken to Detroit and closely\r\nexamined by de Peyster, and nothing detrimental could be proved against\r\nthem, yet de Peyster would not allow them to return to the Sandusky, and\r\nthey made a new settlement on the Huron River.\r\n\r\nDuring the forcible removal of the Moravians seven Wyandot warriors left\r\nthe party and went on a raid across the Ohio River. Among the seven were\r\nthree sons of Dunquat, the half-king; the eldest son, Scotosh, was the\r\nleader of the party. They visited the farm of Philip Jackson, on\r\nHarman’s Creek, and captured Jackson, who was a carpenter about 60 years\r\nof age. This capture was witnessed by Jackson’s son, who ran nine miles\r\nto Fort Cherry, on Little Raccoon Creek, and gave the alarm, but a heavy\r\nrain that night prevented immediate pursuit.\r\n\r\nBright and early next morning seventeen stout young men, all mounted,\r\ngathered at Jackson’s farm, and John Jack, a professional scout,\r\ndeclared he knew where the Indians had hidden their canoes. But only six\r\nwould follow him, John Cherry, Andrew Poe, Adam Poe, William Castleman,\r\nWilliam Rankin and James Whitacre, and they started on a gallop for the\r\nmouth of Tomlinson’s Run. Jack’s surmise was a shrewd one, based on a\r\nthorough knowledge of the Ohio River and the habits of the Indians.\r\n\r\nAfter dismounting the borderers descended cautiously, and at the mouth\r\nof the run were five Indians, with their prisoner, ready to shove off.\r\nJohn Cherry fired and killed an Indian and was himself killed by the\r\nreturn fire. Four of the five Indians were killed, and Philip Jackson\r\nrescued unharmed, and Scotosh escaped up the river with a wound in his\r\narm.\r\n\r\nAndrew Poe in a hand to hand scuffle with two sons of the half-king,\r\nsucceeded in killing one of them, who had first wounded him. The other\r\nIndian escaped and was in the act of firing at Poe when he was shot and\r\nkilled. Andrew Poe fell into the stream and was mistaken for an Indian\r\nand shot in the shoulder by mistake.\r\n\r\nThe triumphant return of the party to Fort Cherry was saddened by the\r\ndeath of John Cherry, a great and popular leader. Scotosh was the only\r\nIndian who escaped, and he made his way back to the Upper Sandusky, with\r\na sad message for his father and the tribe.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Volunteers Fight Two Battles in Hills Along\r\n                      West Branch August 26, 1763\r\n\r\n\r\nFor boldness of attempt and depth of design the Pontiac War was perhaps\r\nunsurpassed in the annals of border warfare.\r\n\r\nSoon as the English had been able to push past the French line of forts,\r\nwhich reached from Presqu’ Isle to the Monongahela, and had gained such\r\na strong foothold in Canada, the Indians planned to destroy them at one\r\nstroke.\r\n\r\nThe renowned chiefs, Kiyasuta, of the Seneca, and Pontiac, of the\r\nOttawa, conceived the gigantic plan of uniting all the northwestern\r\ntribes in a simultaneous attack upon the whole frontier. Utter\r\nextermination was their object.\r\n\r\nThe forts were to be taken by stratagem by separate parties, all on the\r\nsame day. The border settlements were to be attacked during harvest and\r\nmen, women, children, crops, cattle and cabins, were to be destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe English traders among the Indians were the first victims; out of a\r\ntotal of 120, only a few escaped. The frontier settlements among or near\r\nthe mountains were overrun with scalping parties, marking their pathway\r\nwith blood and fire.\r\n\r\nThe forts in Pennsylvania at Presqu’ Isle, Le Boeuf and Venango were\r\ntaken with great slaughter. Those at Fort Pitt, Bedford and Ligonier\r\nwere preserved with great difficulty. Carlisle and Fort Augusta were\r\nthreatened.\r\n\r\nGeneral Amherst promptly dispatched Colonel Henry Bouquet to the relief\r\nof Fort Pitt, and he defeated the Indians and saved the garrison.\r\n\r\nIt was during this distressing period that the Indians planned to attack\r\nthe interior settlements of Pennsylvania as far as Tulpehocken, and\r\ntheir great object was the capture of Fort Augusta, which had been built\r\nat the suggestion of the Indians themselves.\r\n\r\nAlarming intelligence was everywhere received of the contemplated\r\nattacks; friendly Indians gave timely warning of each approaching\r\ndanger. Especially was the situation critical in the vicinity of Paxtang\r\nwhere the treachery of the so-called friendly Indians was several times\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nPreparations were carefully made and the utmost vigilance exercised and\r\nevery available resistance planned by the sturdy frontiersmen. The\r\ngarrison at Fort Augusta was reinforced by additional troops recruited\r\nin the countries nearer the seat of government.\r\n\r\nWith reports constantly reaching Carlisle and other places that the\r\nIndians would attack Fort Augusta in great numbers, and believing that\r\nthe Moravian Indian converts were treacherously giving information to\r\nthe enemy, it was determined to check them.\r\n\r\nColonel John Armstrong, with about three hundred volunteers from\r\nCumberland and Bedford Counties marched from Carlisle on an expedition\r\nto destroy the Indian town at Great Island, now Lock Haven,\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\nWhen Armstrong’s party arrived at Great Island the Indians had already\r\ndeserted their village a few days previous. But on his march he fell\r\nupon another village near the Big Island, now Jersey Shore. So sudden\r\nwas his advance that the Indians were scarcely able to escape; they left\r\nthe food hot upon their bark tables, which was prepared for dinner. The\r\narmy destroyed Great Island village and a large quantity of grain and\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\nA part of this little army was returning down the West Branch, Friday,\r\nAugust 26, when they encountered the enemy at Muncy Creek hill, present\r\nLycoming County, and, in a hot skirmish which ensued, four of the\r\nvolunteers were killed and four wounded. There were quite as many\r\ncasualties among the savages, but they were able to bear away their dead\r\nand wounded.\r\n\r\nCaptains William Patterson, Sharp, Bedford, Laughlin and Crawford with\r\nseventy-six of their commands, arrived at Fort Augusta, Saturday, August\r\n27, 1763. Other stragglers reached the fort during that and the\r\nfollowing day.\r\n\r\nThese soldiers reported details of the sanguinary battle and confirmed\r\nthe fears of the inhabitants about the treachery of the Moravian\r\nIndians. They reported that after the battle a party of Indians\r\nreturning to Great Island from a mission to Bethlehem, were attacked by\r\nthem on a hill north of the present borough of Northumberland, in which\r\naction the troops believed they had killed all of the Indian party of\r\ntwelve.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that these two attacks were made for there are\r\nseveral references to them from different sources, also J. F. Meginness\r\nin his “Otzinachson,” says:\r\n\r\n“It is to be regretted that so little was left on record concerning the\r\noperations of this great expedition. It was the largest that had invaded\r\nthe West Branch Valley up to that time, but instead of wiping out the\r\nsavages and rendering them powerless, it only tended to still further\r\nenrage and cause them to commit greater deeds of blood as was proved by\r\nsubsequent events.”\r\n\r\nThe first great massacre at Wyoming soon followed. A party of Six\r\nNations stealthily murdered Tedyuskung, the Delaware King, by burning\r\nhim to death in his cabin during a drunken bout. They convinced the\r\nDelaware that the crime was perpetrated by whites, who October 15, 1763,\r\nsuddenly turned on the settlers while at work in the fields, brutally\r\nmurdered ten of them, and left their scalped bodies in the fields, while\r\nthey burned their homes, destroyed their crops and drove away the\r\ncattle. None escaped but those who fled in time to reach the mountains.\r\nThis massacre was led by Captain Bull, a son of Tedyuskung.\r\n\r\nOnly the brilliant success of Colonel Henry Bouquet at Bushy Run checked\r\nthe Indians, and with this repulse they became disheartened and soon\r\nafter sued for peace.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Europeans Explore Waters of Pennsylvania,\r\n                         Delaware Bay So Named\r\n                            August 27, 1610\r\n\r\n\r\nQuite different from all other colonies was Pennsylvania in the fact\r\nthat many settlements were made within its borders and many races\r\ncontributed to her people.\r\n\r\nIn 1608, the famous Captain John Smith, of Virginia, sailed up the\r\nChesapeake Bay to its head, where he was stopped by the rocks.\r\n\r\nAt this same time the Dutch of Holland, during a lull in their war with\r\nSpain, were sending maritime expeditions over the world. They sent Henry\r\nHudson to America. He sailed up the coast, on August 28, 1609, in his\r\nship the “Half Moon,” entered the bay now called Delaware Bay, and cast\r\nanchor. Hudson was an Englishman, but in the service now of the Dutch.\r\n\r\nThe republic of the Netherlands, after a struggle never surpassed for\r\nheroism and constancy, had won a truce with King Philip of Spain, and\r\nthe Dutch merchants had sent the English captain out upon the old quest,\r\na short route to China.\r\n\r\nHudson’s appearance in Delaware Bay was before his discovery of the\r\nHudson River, and, therefore, New Netherlands had its origin on the\r\nDelaware, called by the Dutch the Zuyd Revier, or South River.\r\n\r\nHudson navigated his little ship into the bay with great caution. He\r\nspent the day in making soundings, and learned that “he who would\r\nthoroughly discover this great bay must have a small pinnace to send\r\nbefore him, that must draw but four or five feet to sound before him.”\r\n\r\nHudson then sailed up the New Jersey coast, on the third day of\r\nSeptember, anchored his ship within Sandy Hook, and the 12th he entered\r\nNew York Bay through the Narrows, and discovered the great river that\r\nsince has borne his name.\r\n\r\nSo far as the history of Pennsylvania is concerned there is much import\r\nin the exploration of Hudson in Delaware Bay. He made known to his\r\nemployers, the Dutch East India Company, and to the seafaring nations of\r\nwestern Europe, the existence of this wide bay, into which, as he\r\nperceived, a great river must discharge. His discovery laid the ground\r\nfor the claim by the Dutch to the country on the Delaware. Exploration\r\nfollowed, then trade, then occupancy, then a new State, in which the\r\npresent Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey and New York were united\r\nunder one government, called New Netherlands.\r\n\r\nOn August 27, 1610, Captain Samuel Argall, from Jamestown, Va., sailed\r\ninto the Delaware Bay, and, remaining a few hours, gave it the name of\r\nDelaware, in honor of Lord Delaware, then Governor of Virginia. Thus we\r\nnotice that neither Captain John Smith nor Henry Hudson entered\r\nPennsylvania, they approached the very doorway, but did not come inside.\r\n\r\nThe first actual visit of a white man seems to have been six years\r\nlater, when Etienne Brulé, a Frenchman, and a follower of Champlain, the\r\nfirst Governor of New France, came into Pennsylvania via the headwaters\r\nof the Susquehanna River and explored its entire length.\r\n\r\nHudson’s report of a land rich in furs attracted the attention of the\r\nDutch, and before 1614, five vessels came to Manhattan on the North\r\nRiver. One of them, the “Fortune,” commanded by Captain Cornelius\r\nJacobson Mey, sailed in the Zuyd River, and he named the cape at the\r\neast entrance of the bay Cape Mey, and the cape on the west Cape\r\nCornelius.\r\n\r\nOne of these vessels, the “Tiger,” was burned and her captain, Adrian\r\nBlock, built a yacht forty-four and a half feet long, eleven and a half\r\nfeet wide, of sixteen tons burden, to take her place. This boat, the\r\n“Onrust,” was the first built within the limits of the United States,\r\nand she was destined to fame. Cornelius Hendrickson brought the “Onrust”\r\nto the Delaware in 1616, and made the first exploration of the Delaware\r\nRiver, and discovered the mouth of the Schuylkill and first saw the site\r\nof Philadelphia. Here he ransomed from the Indians a Dutchman named\r\nKleynties and two companions, who had come down from the North River by\r\nland, and who may have been the first Europeans in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nOn June 3, 1621, the Dutch West India Company was formed. The charter by\r\nthe Dutch Government gave it the exclusive right to trade on the coast\r\nof America between Newfoundland and the Straits of Magellan. This\r\ncompany, by virtue of its charter, took possession of the country, and\r\ndispatched the ship “New Netherland,” with a number of people, under\r\ncommand of Captain Mey, to the Delaware, where, on the eastern bank,\r\nfifteen leagues from its mouth, Captain Mey erected Fort Nassau.\r\n\r\nThe site of this fort was about five miles above Wilmington, and here\r\nfour married couples and eight seamen lived. This was, probably, the\r\nfirst settlement on the Delaware River. Fort Nassau was a log structure,\r\ncapable of defense against bows and arrows, sufficient for a depot of\r\nfurs, but badly situated to command the commerce of the river. It stood\r\nfor nearly thirty years, until 1651, and in that time was the center on\r\nthis continent of Dutch authority and trade. It was to this fort that\r\nthe Indians of Pennsylvania brought their peltries to exchange for\r\narticles that served their use or pleased their fancy, or for rum that\r\nmade them drunk.\r\n\r\nAnother settlement was made farther north, on the same side of the\r\nriver, which consisted of three or four families.\r\n\r\nThe administration of the affairs of New Netherlands was confided by the\r\nDutch West Indian Company to Peter Minuit, who arrived at Manhattan, May\r\n4, 1626. He came from Wesel, and was commissioned as director-general.\r\nIt was he who soon after his arrival “purchased the island of Manhattan\r\nfrom the Indians for sixty guilders, or the sum of twenty-five dollars\r\nin real money.”\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that the Dutch West Indian Company in 1629 granted\r\nspecial privileges to all persons who should plant any colony in New\r\nNetherland, up until 1631 no white man had made a settlement on the west\r\nbank of the Delaware.\r\n\r\nOn December 30, 1630, David Pieterzoon De Vries, with thirty-two people\r\nand a large stock of cattle, sailed from the Texel, in the ship\r\n“Walrus,” and arrived at the southern cape, Cornelius, now Henlopen, and\r\nmade a settlement near the present town of Lewes, and called it\r\nSwanendael, or the Valley of the Swans. De Vries is the finest figure\r\namong the early pioneer history of the settlement of this part of our\r\ncountry. He was intelligent, energetic and humane.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              World Struggle for Oil Began at Titusville,\r\n                            August 28, 1859\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gigantic struggle for oil began in Titusville, Pennsylvania, August\r\n28, 1859, when Colonel Edwin L. Drake struck oil in the world’s first\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nThis small hole drilled through the rock so peacefully opened the way to\r\nwealth hitherto unknown. It yielded about forty barrels per day, but the\r\nprecious fuel was now produced in commercial quantities. It opened also\r\nthe most important natural production of Pennsylvania, after iron and\r\ncoal.\r\n\r\nThis first well was in Cherry Tree Township, on the Watson Flats, on the\r\nbank of Oil Creek, about two miles below the thrifty borough of\r\nTitusville.\r\n\r\nVenango County seems to have been the native home for petroleum for\r\nalthough it has been found in large quantities in neighboring counties,\r\nit was first gathered there and its presence was known from the advent\r\nof man in that vast region.\r\n\r\nThe Indians gathered oil from a stream called Oil Creek, in this\r\nvicinity, which they used for medicinal purposes. It became well known\r\nall over the country as “Seneca Oil,” “British Oil” and other names. It\r\nwas collected by digging out the place where it oozed out of the ground,\r\nand when oil and water had accumulated, blankets were thrown in, taking\r\nup the oil, when it was wrung out, and the process repeated.\r\n\r\nA century since the product of Oil Creek Valley amounted to a dozen\r\nbarrels a year. The first shipment in bulk was made by a man named Cary,\r\nwho filled two five-gallon kegs and lashed them on either side of the\r\nhorse he rode to the market at Pittsburgh. This supply stocked the\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nBy the year 1865 Venango County shipped 13,000 barrels per day about the\r\nonly oil produced in this country.\r\n\r\nPetroleum was desired as an illuminator, but the small quantity\r\nobtainable made it too expensive.\r\n\r\nAccording to the production records more than one billion barrels of oil\r\nwere produced in 1923 for a world’s record in oil production—and yet the\r\nsupply is far short of the world demand.\r\n\r\nFish oil is the earliest known illuminant and lubricant. “Coal oil,”\r\nhowever, still used erroneously as the name for kerosene, was discovered\r\nless than eighty years ago by Dr. Abraham Gesner, who, in 1846, obtained\r\noil from coal. That was enough to ruin the fish oil industry, and soon\r\nmore than fifty coal oil works were put in operation, distilling oil\r\nfrom bituminous, or soft coal.\r\n\r\nA man named Kier, at Tarentum, Pennsylvania, in 1847, bored for salt\r\nwater and pumped up oil. He put it in barrels and sold it. A professor\r\nat Dartmouth College, using some of the oil, told George H. Bissell that\r\nin his opinion it could be used for illuminating purposes. Bissell\r\ninvestigated these claims and organized the Petroleum Oil Company—which\r\nwas the first of its kind in the United States, and sent a quantity to\r\nBenjamin Silliman, Professor of Chemistry in Yale College, who reported\r\nthat nearly the whole of the raw product could be treated so as to be\r\nused for illuminating and other purposes without any waste.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1857, Colonel Edwin L. Drake, one of the stockholders of\r\nthis company, rode into Titusville on a mail coach from Erie. He carried\r\nwith him $1,000 with which to begin boring for oil. He started\r\nimmediately to his work, but met with many discouragements.\r\n\r\nWell drillers were unknown and well drilling machinery almost unheard of\r\nin 1858. He built his “pump house” and derrick, and with the assistance\r\nof “Uncle Billy” Smith, began drilling.\r\n\r\nThe beginning was made in quicksand and clay, and as soon as the hole\r\nwas made it filled up with water and caved in. Drake then hit upon the\r\nscheme of driving an iron pipe through to bedrock, and its success made\r\nthe use of this method the standard practice of today in the oil fields\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\nAfter rock was reached they bored but three feet per day, but by\r\nSaturday, August 27, 1859, the well had reached the depth of sixty-nine\r\nfeet and the drill was working in coarse sand. Smith and his sons, who\r\nwere helping him, had finished for the week. As they were quitting the\r\ndrill dropped six inches, apparently into a crevice, as was common in\r\nsalt wells. No attention was paid to this circumstance, the tools were\r\ndrawn out and all hands adjourned to Titusville.\r\n\r\nSunday morning Uncle Billy strolled out to the drill, and to his\r\nastonishment found the well filled within a few feet of the surface with\r\na dark fluid. It was oil. The news soon spread to the village, and when\r\nColonel-Drake appeared he found Uncle Billy guarding three barrels of\r\npetroleum. The pumping apparatus was adjusted, and by noon the well was\r\nproducing at the rate of twenty barrels per day. The problem of the ages\r\nhad been solved. The world’s first oil well was in production.\r\n\r\nThen began what has been called the “oil fever.” People from all parts\r\nof the country flocked to western Pennsylvania. Oil companies were\r\neverywhere organized, whose stock was sold on the market. Land which for\r\ngenerations had been regarded as almost barren sold for fabulous prices.\r\n\r\n“Coal Oil Johnnie,” an ignorant young man whose paternal acres had long\r\nbrought only poverty and were now found to be located with wealth,\r\nappeared in Philadelphia, scattering ten dollar bills in all directions,\r\nand buying teams of horses on one day, only to give them to his coachman\r\non the next. He built an opera house in Cincinnati and ended his career\r\nas its doorkeeper.\r\n\r\nIn 1860, near Rouseville, the oil flowed out of a well without the use\r\nof a pump, and other flowing wells in adjacent localities were soon\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nOil was first transported in wagons and boats. The railroads were laid\r\nout to Oil City in 1865. In 1864 Samuel Van Syckel had constructed a\r\npipe line four miles in length, and the result was a change in the\r\nentire method of transportation. A refinery was built at Corry in 1862.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania grade of crude oil is the best lubricant that man has\r\never found. And since refineries can add nothing to an oil that was not\r\npresent in its crude state, Pennsylvania grade of crude oil is still\r\nsupreme.\r\n\r\nIn recent years the Standard Oil Company has controlled to a great\r\nextent the oil production of the country.\r\n\r\nThe largest individual fortune the world has ever seen is the outcome of\r\nthe development of the business of securing and distributing coal oil.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Joseph Galloway, Loyalist Politician, and\r\n                      Member Continental Congress,\r\n                          Died August 29, 1803\r\n\r\n\r\nJoseph Galloway, the Loyalist Politician, was born in the town of West\r\nRiver, Anne Arundel County, Maryland, in the year 1731. His\r\ngreat-grandfather, Richard Galloway, of London, England, acquired\r\nconsiderable land in Lord Baltimore’s province in 1662, thus indicating\r\nthat he was a man of good fortune and respectability.\r\n\r\nPeter Galloway, father of Joseph, removed with his family in 1740 to\r\nKent, not far from Philadelphia, where he died while Joseph was yet a\r\nmere boy. Being possessed of large landed property Joseph chose the\r\nstudy of law, and was admitted to the bar and allowed to practice before\r\nthe Supreme Court of Pennsylvania as early as 1749. In the meantime he\r\nhad obtained a good social standing, and as early as 1748 had been made\r\na member of the Schuylkill Fishing Company, a club composed of the most\r\nprominent and aristocratic men of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nMr. Galloway still further enhanced his prospects by his marriage in\r\n1753 with Grace Growden, daughter of Lawrence Growden, an influential\r\ncharacter and a former Speaker of the Assembly. The Growdens were the\r\nowners of the famous iron works at Durham, Pennsylvania, and possessed\r\nlarge means.\r\n\r\nMr. Galloway rapidly acquired a large practice and became one of the\r\neminent lawyers in the province. He and John Dickinson succeeded Andrew\r\nHamilton in the leadership of the Philadelphia bar prior to the\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nGalloway became a member of the Pennsylvania Assembly in 1756, and his\r\nlegal talents proved of especial service in that body. In recognition of\r\nhis unusual attainments as a lawyer and public man, Mr. Galloway was\r\ngiven the degree LL.D., by Princeton College in 1769.\r\n\r\nMr. Galloway several times served as an Indian Commissioner and attended\r\nimportant conferences at Easton and on missions to the Indian country.\r\n\r\nHe became an opponent of the Proprietaries and fought a successful\r\nbattle with the Governor over the question of preserving to the Assembly\r\nthe disposal of the money and forbidding the Governor to assist in its\r\nexpenditure.\r\n\r\nWhen the effort was made to abolish the Proprietorship and make\r\nPennsylvania a royal province, the Assembly passed resolutions\r\nrehearsing the tyranny of the Proprietary and a bitter factional\r\nstruggle ensued among the people. In October, 1764, the Assembly passed\r\nthe resolution for a change of government by a vote of 27 to 3. Rather\r\nthan sign the document Isaac Norris resigned as speaker.\r\n\r\nIn the final debate, Joseph Galloway and John Dickinson made the leading\r\nspeeches for and against, respectively. Galloway favored the abolition\r\nof the Proprietary government, while Dickinson believed its continuance\r\nwould better serve the province. Benjamin Franklin and Galloway were so\r\nclosely associated that their leadership was hard to beat.\r\n\r\nGalloway was at the head of the committee which considered and reported\r\nupon the grievances of the Province in the “Paxtang Riot” affair\r\nfollowing the murder of the Conestoga Indians, December, 1763.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of Galloway during the excitement attending the passage of\r\nthe Stamp Act was conspicuously loyal. He feared the tyranny of mob rule\r\nmore than the tyranny of Parliament.\r\n\r\nMr. Galloway gave expression to his views in an article signed\r\n“Americanus,” printed in the Pennsylvania Journal, in which he warned\r\nhis countrymen of the evils to which their seditious conduct would lead.\r\nThis article aroused great indignation against him. He was called a Tory\r\nand went by the name of “Americanus” for some time.\r\n\r\nMr. Galloway had an extreme aversion to the Presbyterians. He associated\r\nthem with rioters, and in their support of the “Paxtang Boys” he was\r\nconvinced they were dangerous characters.\r\n\r\nAlthough he had taken a rather unpopular stand in the Stamp Act\r\ncontroversy, he was returned to the Assembly in 1766, and elected its\r\nSpeaker.\r\n\r\nMr. Galloway approved the proposal for a Continental Congress and was\r\none of the eight Pennsylvanians who composed the First Continental\r\nCongress. Although Dickinson was the leader, Galloway played a\r\nconspicuous but not very honorable part. According to Bancroft, he\r\n“acted as a volunteer spy for the British Government.”\r\n\r\nIt is a fact that he was a conservative in his views, and that his line\r\nof argument in his first debates tended towards political independence.\r\nHe proposed a plan of colonial government, which was rejected. This plan\r\ncontemplated a government with a president-general appointed by the\r\nking, and a Grand Council, chosen every three years by the colonial\r\nassemblies, who were to be authorized to act jointly with Parliament in\r\nthe regulation of affairs of the colonies.\r\n\r\nThe following year Galloway was permitted to resign and thus be relieved\r\nfrom serving on account of the radical acts against England. He\r\nabandoned the Whigs soon as the question of independence had begun to be\r\nagitated, and thence forward he was regarded as a zealous Tory.\r\n\r\nWhen the Howes issued their proclamation in 1776, granting amnesty to\r\nsuch Americans as would forsake the Revolutionary cause, Galloway’s\r\ncourage failed him and he accepted the offer.\r\n\r\n           “Galloway has fled and joined the venal Howe;\r\n           To prove his baseness, see him cringe and bow,\r\n           A traitor to his country and its laws,\r\n           A friend to tyrants and their cursed cause,” etc.\r\n\r\nGalloway accompanied Howe’s expedition against Philadelphia. When the\r\nBritish assumed control he was appointed Superintendent of the Police of\r\nthe City and Suburbs, of the Port and of the Prohibited Articles. Thus\r\nhe was for about five months the head of the civil government.\r\n\r\nHe raised and disciplined troops; and gathered a company of Bucks County\r\nrefugees, and with these two bodies he carried on military enterprises\r\nagainst Americans.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania Assembly, March 6, 1778, passed an “act for the\r\nattainder of divers traitors,” among whom was Joseph Galloway. His\r\nestate was confiscated, and according to his testimony before\r\nParliament, was worth at least £40,000 sterling. His house was\r\nappropriated by the State of Pennsylvania as a residence for the\r\nPresident of the Supreme Executive Council, but was afterwards sold to\r\nRobert Morris.\r\n\r\nForbidden the privilege of returning to Pennsylvania, Mr. Galloway\r\ndevoted his leisure time to religious studies. He died at Watford,\r\nHerts, England, August 29, 1803.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Etymology of Pennsylvania Counties Erected\r\n                  Since Penn Set Sail August 30, 1682\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Penn sailed from England in the ship “Welcome,” August 30, 1682.\r\n\r\nUpon his arrival the organization of his province was pushed with\r\ndispatch, and today that vast territory is divided into sixty-seven\r\ncounties, each one of which possesses history worth the telling.\r\n\r\nThe genealogy of the counties of Pennsylvania is both interesting and\r\nhistorical, and presents some valuable data. The three original counties\r\nwere Philadelphia, Chester and Bucks, so named by William Penn in the\r\nlatter part of the year 1682.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular coincidence that Philadelphia County should be\r\nsurrounded with counties somewhat similar to those which surround London\r\nin England; Buckingham, or Bucks, Chester and Lancashire.\r\n\r\nThe name Philadelphia means “brotherly love,” the other three were given\r\ntheir names in honor of their English importance. In fact all the\r\ncounties formed and named prior to the Revolution were named identically\r\nand relatively after the counties in England in this chronological order\r\nin the Province—Philadelphia, Chester, Bucks, Lancaster, York,\r\nCumberland, Berks, Northampton, Bedford, Northumberland and\r\nWestmoreland.\r\n\r\nFollowing the independence of the colonies only three of the counties of\r\nPennsylvania were afterwards given names of English Counties. They were\r\nHuntingdon, Somerset and Cambria.\r\n\r\nIn an interesting paper prepared by the late Dr. Hugh Hamilton, of\r\nHarrisburg and read before the Federation of Historical Societies of\r\nPennsylvania, of which he was then president, the sixty-seven counties\r\nwere grouped etymologically as follows:\r\n\r\n“Sentimental—Philadelphia, Columbia, Lebanon and Union.\r\n\r\n“Familiar—Bedford, Berks, Bucks, Cambria, Chester, Cumberland,\r\nHuntingdon, Lancaster, Northampton, Northumberland, Somerset, York and\r\nWestmoreland.\r\n\r\n“Gratitude—Armstrong, Bradford, Butler, Clinton, Crawford, Dauphin,\r\nLuzerne, Mercer, Mifflin, Montgomery, Fayette, Fulton, Greene, Lawrence,\r\nMontour, Perry, Pike, Sullivan, Warren, Washington and Wayne.\r\n\r\n“Political—Adams, Blair, Cameron, Franklin, Jefferson, McKean, Monroe\r\nand Snyder.\r\n\r\n“Aboriginal—Allegheny, Delaware, Erie, Indiana, Juniata, Lackawanna,\r\nLehigh, Lycoming, Susquehanna, Tioga, Venango and Wyoming.\r\n\r\n“Topographical—Center and Clarion.\r\n\r\n“Faunal—Beaver, Carbon, Clearfield, Elk, Forest, Schuylkill.”\r\n\r\nIt would seem as if Schuylkill should be placed with the aboriginal\r\ngroup and a new one placed in the list called possibly natural\r\ncharacteristics, when Carbon, Clearfield and Forest would be placed and\r\ntaken from the faunal group. However, the grouping is of much interest\r\nand value.\r\n\r\nMany of these counties were formed and received their names at times of\r\nsome event in history or when a distinguished person seemed entitled to\r\nbe thus honored.\r\n\r\nWashington County was named in honor of the commander-in-chief of the\r\nContinental Army in 1781, before he was even thought of as the first\r\npresident of the United States. And it is an interesting fact that\r\nWashington County was the first one erected after the Declaration of\r\nIndependence. Thus Washington became first in Pennsylvania, as well as\r\nin war, peace and the hearts of his countrymen. And it is equally\r\ninteresting that the very next county to be formed in the patriotic\r\nState of Pennsylvania should be named after General La Fayette, who\r\nrendered such conspicuous service to the colonies and was so close to\r\nWashington during the trying days of the great war for liberty. Fayette\r\nwas organized September 26, 1783.\r\n\r\nThen the statesmen paid a great tribute to Franklin, who was the great\r\nAmerican patriot and statesman. Armstrong was named in honor of Colonel\r\nJohn Armstrong of Carlisle, who led the successful expedition against\r\nthe Indian town at Kittanning and who afterwards became a general and\r\nrendered distinguished service in the Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe counties of Butler, Crawford, Mifflin, Pike, Potter and Wayne were\r\nnamed in honor of distinguished Pennsylvania officers of the Revolution;\r\nwhile Greene and Mercer were names suggested by General Washington, both\r\nas a tribute to distinguished generals of the Revolution, who were much\r\nin Pennsylvania; Sullivan and Perry were named for generals whose great\r\ntriumphs were enacted here, and Warren County was named in honor of the\r\ngeneral who made the supreme sacrifice at Bunker Hill.\r\n\r\nBradford County was originally Ontario in the bill creating it, but the\r\nname was changed in honor of former Attorney General William Bradford,\r\nof Pennsylvania. Lawrence was so named in honor of the flagship of\r\nCommodore Oliver H. Perry; Fulton in honor of Lancaster County’s native\r\nson, Robert Fulton, who first successfully ran a steamboat. Clinton was\r\nintended to be called Eagle County, but the name was changed to Clinton.\r\nMontour was so named in honor of Madame Montour and her two\r\ndistinguished sons, Henry and Andrew, Indians who were ever loyal to the\r\nProvincial Government of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nDauphin and Luzerne were so named in thankfulness to France, the former\r\nin honor of the eldest son of Louis XVI, and the latter in tribute to\r\nthe Minister of France then in the United States.\r\n\r\nIt is rather to be regretted that more of our counties, cities, boroughs\r\nand villages do not still retain their original aboriginal names such as\r\nhave been retained in Allegheny, Delaware, Erie, Indiana, Juniata,\r\nLackawanna, Lehigh, Lycoming, Susquehanna, Tioga, Venango, Wyoming and\r\nSchuylkill Counties.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Penn Obtains Deed to Province, Then\r\n                         Obtains Lower Counties\r\n                            August 31, 1682\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo motives operated in the early colonization of the American\r\nContinent; one was the desire of amassing sudden wealth without working\r\nfor it; this tempted the adventurous to seek gold here, to trade\r\nvalueless trinkets to the Indians for valuable furs and skins; the other\r\nwas the desire to escape unjust restrictions of government and the hated\r\nban of society against the worship of God according to the dictates of\r\none’s own conscience, which incited devotees of Christianity to forego\r\nthe comforts of home in the midst of civilization, and to make for\r\nthemselves a habitation on the shores of the new world.\r\n\r\nWilliam Penn, the founder of Pennsylvania, had felt the heavy hand of\r\npersecution for religious opinion’s sake. As a gentleman commoner at\r\nOxford, he had been fined and finally expelled for nonconformity to the\r\nestablished church; at home he was whipped and turned out of doors by\r\nhis father; he was sent to prison by the Mayor of Cork, where for seven\r\nmonths he languished in the Tower of London, and, finally, to complete\r\nhis disgrace, he was cast into Newgate with common felons.\r\n\r\nUpon the accession of James II to the throne of England, more than\r\nfourteen hundred persons of Quaker faith were immured in prisons for a\r\nconscientious adherence to their religious convictions. To escape this\r\npersecution Penn and his followers were moved to emigrate to the New\r\nWorld, as they called it.\r\n\r\nIn 1680 Penn made application to Charles II for a grant of land in\r\nAmerica. He based his claim upon moneys due to his father because of\r\nlosses in the public service, where he was a distinguished officer of\r\nthe British navy.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of York gave his consent and the king issued a patent to\r\nWilliam Penn, March 4, 1681.\r\n\r\nPenn was not prepared to visit his new province during the first year,\r\nbut he dispatched three shiploads of settlers, and with them sent his\r\ncousin, Captain William Markham, to take formal possession of the\r\ncountry and act as deputy governor.\r\n\r\nMarkham arrived at New York, June 21, 1681, and exhibited his\r\ncommission, bearing date April 10, 1681. He also presented the king’s\r\ncharter and proclamation.\r\n\r\nArmed with these credentials Markham proceeded to the Delaware, where he\r\nwas kindly received. He met Lord Baltimore, who happened to be in the\r\nprovince, and the Maryland proprietor discovered by observation that\r\nUpland was at least twelve miles south of the fortieth degree of\r\nlatitude, and believed his province, therefore, extended to the\r\nSchuylkill.\r\n\r\nThis claim by Baltimore induced Penn to obtain additional grants, as\r\nwithout them he feared the loss of his whole peninsula.\r\n\r\nMarkham was accompanied to Pennsylvania by four commissioners appointed\r\nby Penn, who, in conjunction with the Governor, had two chief duties\r\nassigned them; the first was to meet and preserve friendly relations\r\nwith the Indians, and acquire lands by actual purchase, and the second\r\nwas to select the site of a great city and to make the necessary\r\nsurveys.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the year following, Penn published his frame of\r\ngovernment, and certain laws, agreed on in England by himself and the\r\npurchasers under him, entitled: “The frame of the government of the\r\nProvince of Pennsylvania, in America; together with certain laws, agreed\r\nupon in England by the Governor and Divers of the Free-Men of the\r\naforesaid Province. To be further Explained and Confirmed there, by the\r\nfirst Provincial Council and General Assembly that shall be held, if\r\nthey see meet.”\r\n\r\nLest any trouble might arise in the future from claims founded on the\r\ngrant of land in America to the Duke of York, of “Long Island and\r\nadjacent territories occupied by the Dutch,” the prudent forethought of\r\nWilliam Penn prompted him to obtain a deed from the Duke, which he\r\nsucceeded in doing August 31, 1682.\r\n\r\nThe deed included the land in Pennsylvania, substantially in the terms\r\ncited in the original Royal Charter.\r\n\r\nBut Penn, even with the new deed, was not quite satisfied. He was cut\r\noff from the ocean by the uncertain navigation of some narrow stream.\r\nHe, therefore, obtained an additional deed from the Duke of York which\r\nwas for the grant of New Castle and district twelve miles in radius\r\naround it, and also a further grant from the Duke of a tract extending\r\nto Cape Henlopen, embracing the two counties of Kent and Sussex.\r\n\r\nThis new grant to Penn was thereafter termed “the territories,” or “the\r\nthree lower counties,” and for many years remained a part of\r\nPennsylvania, until finally separated, since which time it has formed\r\nthe State of Delaware.\r\n\r\nWilliam Penn was now satisfied with the limits of his province and drew\r\nup such a description of the country from his limited knowledge as he\r\nwas able to give.\r\n\r\nThis description was published in an attractive booklet, together with\r\nthe Royal Charter and proclamation; terms of settlement, and other\r\nmatters pertaining thereto, and broadcast throughout the Kingdom. He\r\ntook particular pains to have these books fall into the hands of\r\nFriends.\r\n\r\nThe terms of sale of lands were forty shillings for one hundred acres\r\nand one shilling per acre annual rental.\r\n\r\nThe question had been raised regarding the annual rental, but the terms\r\nof the grant by the Royal Charter to Penn were made absolute on the\r\n“payment therefore to us, our heirs and successors, two beaver skins, to\r\nbe delivered at our castle on Windsor, on the first day of January in\r\nevery year, and the contingent payment of one-fifth part of all gold and\r\nsilver which, from time to time, happened to be found, clear of all\r\ncharges.” William Penn, therefore, held his title only by the payments\r\nof quit-rents. He could in consequence give a valid title only by\r\nexacting the quit-rents.\r\n\r\nThese deeds for the “lower counties” were duly recorded in New York,\r\nand, by proclamation of the commander there, November 21, 1682, to the\r\nmagistrates on the west side of the Delaware, the rights of Penn under\r\nthem were publicly recognized and allegiance was cheerfully transferred\r\nto Penn’s new government.\r\n\r\nPenn then completed his arrangements for his voyage to his Province,\r\nwhere he arrived October, 1682.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Dr. John Cochran, Native of Pennsylvania,\r\n                    Director-General Hospitals, Born\r\n                           September 1, 1730\r\n\r\n\r\nA century and a half has almost elapsed since the American Revolution,\r\nand in the interim much has been written and published concerning it.\r\nBut comparatively little has ever been accessible to the public\r\nconcerning the medical department of the army of patriots.\r\n\r\nTo Pennsylvanians particularly this feature of the war should prove of\r\ninterest, for the only Directors General of Military Hospitals were none\r\nother than Dr. William Shippen and Dr. John Cochran, both of\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1570 John Cochran, of kin to the Earl of Dundonald,\r\nemigrated from Paisley in Scotland, to the North of Ireland. James, his\r\ndescendant in the sixth generation, crossed the sea to America, and in\r\nthe early part of the eighteenth century settled in Pennsylvania. His\r\nthird son, born at Sadsbury, Pennsylvania, September 1, 1730, was Doctor\r\nJohn Cochran, of the Revolution, who was educated for a surgeon by Dr.\r\nRobert Thompson of Lancaster.\r\n\r\nHaving qualified as a physician at the time of the outbreak of the\r\nFrench and Indian War, he entered the English service as surgeon’s mate,\r\nand remained on active duty until the close of hostilities. In the\r\ncampaigns of this war he acquired the medical proficiency and surgical\r\nexpertness for which he was afterward celebrated.\r\n\r\nOn December 4, 1760, he married Gertrude Schuyler, only sister of\r\nGeneral Philip Schuyler, of New York.\r\n\r\nDr. Cochran afterward removed to Brunswick, N. J., where he practiced\r\nhis profession, until the British burned his house in the early part of\r\nthe Revolutionary War.\r\n\r\nAt the close of 1776 he volunteered his services in the Continental army\r\nand General Washington, remembering his experience and usefulness in the\r\nFrench war, was prompt in recommending his name to the Continental\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nDr. Cochran and Dr. William Shippen had prepared a report on hospitals\r\nupon plans modeled after those of the British army, and submitted their\r\nefforts to Congress, after they were approved by General Washington. On\r\nApril 7, 1777, Congress adopted this report, which remained in effect\r\nuntil remodeled by Congress, September 30, 1780.\r\n\r\nOn April 11, 1777, in pursuance of General Washington’s recommendation,\r\nDoctor John Cochran received the appointment of Chief Physician and\r\nSurgeon-General of the Army.\r\n\r\nAfter nearly four years of exacting service in this position, he was, on\r\nJanuary 17, 1781, on the resignation of Dr. William Shippen, promoted to\r\nbe Director of the Military Hospitals of the United States, in which\r\ncapacity he continued until the end of the war.\r\n\r\nFortunately a letter book kept by Doctor Cochran has been preserved. The\r\nentries, memorandums and letters partake of the authority of an official\r\nrecord. They also disclose the many distressing difficulties of the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nThe Medical Department, as re-arranged October 6, 1780, consisted of a\r\nDirector, stationed at general headquarters, a Chief Physician and\r\nSurgeon, stationed with the army, three chief physicians and surgeons of\r\nthe hospitals stationed variously at the principal hospitals, and other\r\nassistants, mates, orderlies, matrons and nurses, as occasion required.\r\n\r\nWhen Doctor Cochran was promoted to be Director, Dr. James Craik was\r\ngiven the place of Chief Physician and Surgeon of the Army, and Dr.\r\nWilliam Burnet was made first of the three chief physicians, with Dr.\r\nMalichi Treat and Dr. Charles McKnight as the other two chiefs. Dr.\r\nThomas Bond was made purveyor and Dr. Andrew Cragie, the apothecary.\r\n\r\nSome estimate may be had of Doctor Cochran’s real worth, when it is\r\nknown that Dr. Craik was the life-long friend and personal physician of\r\nGeneral Washington, yet was his subordinate.\r\n\r\nPrevious to this time there had been several very important hospitals in\r\nPennsylvania, the base hospital twice being at Bethlehem; first on\r\nDecember 3, 1776, until March 27, 1777, when the hospital was removed to\r\nPhiladelphia; then after the battle of Brandywine, September 11, 1777,\r\nBethlehem again became the base hospital. The wounded from the battle of\r\nGermantown were also treated there. On August 28, 1778, the remaining\r\npatients were removed to Lancaster and Yellow Springs. Other hospitals\r\nin Pennsylvania were at Ephrata, Lititz and Reading.\r\n\r\nThe position of Director was always most exacting; not only were his\r\nduties the alleviation of the suffering, in the rigors of a Valley\r\nForge, or stimulating its convalescence in the camp at Norristown, but\r\noften the finances were expended and the medical stores entirely\r\nexhausted. At no time did the army abound in medical stores.\r\n\r\nAt times hundreds were sick and lame when there were no supplies to\r\nrelieve them, Untended wounds or languishing disease filled hospitals\r\ndestitute of medicines. Scarcely was convalescence a boon, when lack of\r\nsubsistence faced the soldier in the hospital and often compelled him to\r\nbeg in the streets for the very necessaries of life.\r\n\r\nIn this appalling crisis Doctor Cochran seemed to be the right man in\r\nthe right place. He remained almost constantly in the field and\r\npurchased supplies as they moved from place to place, and made such\r\nstrong and insistent appeals to Congress that some better support was\r\ngiven him, but not before his staff had been reduced to eight hospital\r\nphysicians out of the fifteen established by Congress, and only five of\r\nthese on actual duty.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1782 a quantity of medicine was received from France and it\r\narrived none too soon.\r\n\r\nBut the lack of medicine was not the only hardship of those in the\r\nMedical Department. A letter from Dr. Cochran to Abram Clark, President\r\nof Congress, dated February 28, 1781, says: “I hope some pay is ordered\r\nto be advanced to the officers of the department, without which it\r\ncannot much longer exist. Many of us have not received a shilling in\r\nnear two years, nor can we procure public clothing.”\r\n\r\nMany hospital physicians resigned owing to their inability to subsist\r\nthemselves longer. When Congress at length issued warrants they were as\r\nworthless as the credit of Congress, and they afforded no relief.\r\n\r\nDr. Cochran was of stately presence and most genial. He won his high\r\nplace by real merit and experience.\r\n\r\nHe pawned his personal credit for the cause; the last sheets from his\r\nbed were used on the wounded. He quieted dissensions in the department,\r\ncomposed the difficulties of individuals, presented petitions for his\r\nsubordinate officers, and performed routine work which should have been\r\ndone by others. All this various labor was performed with cheerfulness\r\nin adversity, and courage amid danger.\r\n\r\nHe was on terms of intimacy with Washington, Lafayette, Wayne, Paul\r\nJones and many more. Washington presented him with his camp furniture,\r\nLafayette gave him his watch, Wayne gave him his sword, the silver hilt\r\nof which was melted into goblets.\r\n\r\nDr. Cochran was a charter member of the Society of the Cincinnati. He\r\ndied at his country-seat at Palatine, Montgomery County, N. Y., April 6,\r\n1807. His widow survived him until March, 1813.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             Constitution of 1790, the First for the State,\r\n                       Adopted September 2, 1790\r\n\r\n\r\nThe convention to frame a Constitution for the government of\r\nPennsylvania as a State completed its labors September 2, 1790.\r\n\r\nOn that day the members signed the instrument, after which they went in\r\nprocession from the State House to the court-house, where the new\r\nConstitution was proclaimed.\r\n\r\nProvision had been made for the continuance in office, until the new\r\ngovernment went into operation, of the Supreme Executive Council and\r\nother State officers, but not of the Legislature, and the latter body\r\nbelieving its authority had ceased, did not proceed to the transaction\r\nof business on the following day.\r\n\r\nAt the election held in October, Thomas Mifflin, of Philadelphia, who\r\nhad been president of the Supreme Executive Council since November 5,\r\n1788, was elected governor over General Arthur St. Clair.\r\n\r\nThe new Legislature met in the State House December 7, and on December\r\n21 the change of government was formally effected.\r\n\r\nA procession was formed at the chamber of the Supreme Executive Council,\r\nwhich moved to the old court-house at Second and Market Streets, where\r\nthe old government yielded up its powers, and the new government was\r\nproclaimed. Governor Mifflin was inaugurated “with much ceremony.”\r\n\r\nOn January 1, 1791, the City Councils, Mayor, Recorder and a great\r\nnumber of citizens waited on Governor Mifflin and tendered him their\r\ncongratulations.\r\n\r\nThe first constitutional convention, whose most conspicuous members were\r\nBenjamin Franklin, David Rittenhouse, George Ross and James Smith, met\r\nat Philadelphia July 15, 1776, each one taking, without hesitancy, the\r\nprescribed test oath, and organized by the selection of Benjamin\r\nFranklin, president.\r\n\r\nThe labors of this convention were completed September 28, when the\r\nConstitution was adopted, and went into immediate effect without a vote\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\nThis Constitution vested executive authority in a Council of Safety,\r\npresided over by Thomas Wharton, Jr., composed of twelve members, one\r\nfrom Philadelphia and one from each of the counties. The legislative\r\npower was vested in a General Assembly of one house elected annually,\r\nand consisting of six members from Philadelphia and six from each\r\ncounty. The supreme executive power was vested in a President, chosen\r\nannually by the Assembly and Council.\r\n\r\nA Council of Censors, consisting of two persons from Philadelphia and\r\ntwo from each county, was to be elected in 1783, and in each seventh\r\nyear thereafter, whose duty was to supervise the Constitution and the\r\nbranches of government, with a power to impeach.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of 1776 also provided that, “all useful learning shall\r\nbe duly encouraged and promoted in one or more universities.” This was\r\nthe first time in America that higher education was made a part of the\r\nfundamental law.\r\n\r\nFollowing the successful termination of the Revolution the Pennsylvania\r\nConstitution of 1776 proved inadequate for the requirements of a useful\r\nand effective State Government, and its revision was demanded.\r\n\r\nOn March 24, 1789, the Assembly adopted resolutions recommending the\r\nelection of delegates to form a new Constitution. The Supreme Executive\r\nCouncil refused to promulgate this action of the Assembly, but\r\nacquiesced in September. An election was held in October, when delegates\r\nwere chosen.\r\n\r\nThe convention met November 24, 1789, and in it were the first talents\r\nthat Pennsylvania could boast. Thomas McKean, Thomas Mifflin, Albert\r\nGallatin, William Findlay, James Wilson, William Lewis, James Ross,\r\nAlexander Addison, Edward Hand, Samuel Sitgreaves, Joseph Hiester and\r\nThomas Pickering were among the members. Thomas Mifflin was elected\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nAfter a long session the members adjourned in the ensuing year to meet\r\nagain, when the subject of the Constitution was again taken up and\r\nconcluded, and the new instrument adopted September 2, 1790.\r\n\r\nThe most radical changes were made in the executive and legislative\r\nbranches of government.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Executive Council was abolished, and a single executive\r\ncalled a governor was created. The Assembly ceased to have the sole\r\nright to make laws, as the legislative body was divided into two\r\nbranches, a Senate and a House.\r\n\r\nThe former judicial system was continued, excepting that a Supreme Court\r\nwas provided, the judges of which were to be appointed during good\r\nbehavior, instead of for seven years.\r\n\r\nThe Bill of Rights re-enacted the old Provincial provision copied into\r\nthe first Constitution, respecting freedom of worship, rights of\r\nconscience, and exemptions from compulsory contributions for the support\r\nof any ministry. The recognition of God, and of a future state of\r\nrewards and punishments, was still demanded of all holding office, but a\r\nbelief in the divine inspiration of the Old and New Testaments was not\r\nincluded.\r\n\r\nThe Council of Censors ceased to have authority, and the veto power was\r\ngiven to the Governor.\r\n\r\nThis body, with Frederick A. Muhlenberg as president, had met but once,\r\nin 1783. It then got itself into such a snarl with the Assembly that it\r\nbecame very unpopular.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania conformed in all important matters to the system upon which\r\nthe New Federal Government was to be administered.\r\n\r\nGeneral Mifflin continued to discharge the duties of the chief executive\r\nwith great ability, and was re-elected twice, serving in all three\r\nterms, the limit allowed by the Constitution.\r\n\r\nGovernor Mifflin was elected to the Legislature at the end of his\r\nservice as Governor, and died at Lancaster, January 21, 1800, while\r\nserving in that body.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   General Edward Hand, Distinguished\r\n                      Officer of Revolution, Died\r\n                           September 3, 1802\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Edward Hand, M.D., a native of Clyduff, Kings County, Province\r\nof Leinster, Ireland, born December 31, 1744, became a resident of\r\nLancaster, Pennsylvania, and one of the first distinguished officers of\r\nthe Revolution. He died at his fine farm “Rockford,” near Lancaster,\r\nSeptember 3, 1802.\r\n\r\nIn 1767 he was appointed by King George III surgeon of the Eighteenth\r\nRoyal Irish Regiment of Foot, and sailed with the regiment from Cork,\r\nMay 20 of the same year, arriving at Philadelphia July 11.\r\n\r\nDr. Hand was appointed ensign in the same regiment in 1772, and\r\naccompanied the command to Fort Pitt, returning to Philadelphia in 1774,\r\nwhen he resigned his commission and was regularly discharged from the\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nIn the same year he went to Lancaster, with recommendations, in order to\r\npractice his profession in that place.\r\n\r\nThe following year he married Catherine, daughter of Captain John Ewing\r\nand Sarah Yeates, a sister of Hon. Jasper Yeates.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the American Revolution Dr. Hand gave his allegiance\r\nto the colonies, and was commissioned, June 25, 1775, lieutenant-colonel\r\nin Colonel William Thompson’s Battalion of Riflemen.\r\n\r\nThis battalion consisted of nine companies of troops enlisted in the\r\ncounties of Cumberland, York, Lancaster, Northumberland, Bedford, Berks\r\nand Northampton. After January 1, 1776, it became known as the First\r\nRegiment of the Army of the United Colonies.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Hand accompanied Colonel Thompson and the battalion\r\nto Boston, where they arrived August 17, 1775. He was on Prospect Hill,\r\nAugust 20, when the battalion distinguished itself, and participated in\r\nthe siege of Boston during the following autumn and winter.\r\n\r\nThe officers and men of the battalion were publicly thanked by General\r\nWashington in general orders the day following the skirmish at\r\nLechmere’s Point, November 9, when each man demeaned himself with\r\nunusual skill and daring. The British had landed under cover of a fire\r\nfrom their batteries on Bunker, Breed’s and Copp’s Hills, as well as\r\nfrom a frigate which lay three hundred yards off the point, which at\r\nhigh tide was an island. The regiment marched instantly, and, though the\r\nday was stormy, regarded not the tide, nor waited for boats, but took to\r\nthe water, although up to their armpits, for a quarter of a mile and,\r\nnotwithstanding the regulars’ fire, reached the island and drove the\r\nenemy from behind their cover into their boats.\r\n\r\nMarch 7, 1776, Hand was appointed colonel of the regiment he had\r\ncommanded since February 2, and, with his command, left Cambridge March\r\n15 to join General John Sullivan in New York.\r\n\r\nDuring May and June this regiment was on Long Island. It picketed the\r\nshores until August.\r\n\r\nColonel Hand took part, with his regiment, in the battle of Long Island,\r\nand assisted to successfully protect the retreat of the American army.\r\nThis was a skillful maneuver which effected the retreat of twelve\r\nthousand men, within sight of a strong enemy, possessed of a mighty\r\nfleet, without any loss of troops and saving all the baggage.\r\n\r\nColonel Hand took part in the battles of White Plains, Trenton and\r\nPrinceton. At the last of these conflicts, says General Wilkinson, “at\r\nthe time General Mercer engaged the 17th Regiment, Colonel Hand\r\nendeavored, by a rapid movement, to turn the enemy’s left flank, and had\r\nnearly succeeded when they fled in disorder ... the riflemen were\r\ntherefore the first in the pursuit, and in fact took the greatest part\r\nof the prisoners; they were accompanied by General Washington in person\r\nwith a squad of the Philadelphia Troop.”\r\n\r\nColonel Hand continued in command of his regiment until April 1, 1777,\r\nwhen he was promoted to be brigadier-general, and was soon thereafter\r\nsent to Fort Pitt in command of the western frontiers of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nA new fort was erected in Westmoreland County, named Fort Hand.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hand did not meet with the expected success in fighting Indians\r\nand asked to be relieved of his command, which Congress, May 2, 1778,\r\nresolved to do. But before leaving Fort Pitt, General Hand conducted a\r\nsuccessful treaty with the Indians June 17, 1778.\r\n\r\nIn October following he succeeded General Stark in command at Albany,\r\nand the next spring General Hand was ordered to take part in General\r\nSullivan’s campaign against the Six Nations. Although the youngest of\r\nthe generals engaged, Hand held the most important position after that\r\nof General Sullivan. His experience in fighting Indians gained on the\r\nwestern frontier was of great value in the expedition.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hand afterward joined General Washington and encamped at\r\nMorristown, N. J., during the winter.\r\n\r\nOn the formation of the light infantry corps of the army, August, 1780,\r\nGeneral Hand was given command of one of the two brigades.\r\n\r\nHe was a member of the tribunal that tried and convicted Major André.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hand was appointed Adjutant-General of the Army of the United\r\nStates January 8, 1781. He was present at the siege of Yorktown and\r\nreturned with the troops to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nSeptember 30, 1783, he was commissioned Major-General of the\r\nPennsylvania Line.\r\n\r\nUpon the close of the war he resumed his practice of medicine at\r\nLancaster.\r\n\r\nHe was a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1784 and 1785, and a\r\nmember of the General Assembly 1785, and an Elector for the first\r\nelection of a President and Vice President of the United States in 1789.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hand helped frame the Constitution of Pennsylvania of 1790, and\r\nheld other positions of honor and trust.\r\n\r\nHe was an original member of the Society of the Cincinnati, and served\r\nas President in 1799. He was the lover of fine horses and was himself an\r\nexcellent horseman.\r\n\r\nAs a citizen he was highly esteemed, and as a physician greatly sought\r\nafter and much beloved. He was a great Pennsylvanian.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                First Permanent Settlement and Earliest\r\n                  Church, Dedicated September 4, 1646\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first European settlement in what is now Pennsylvania was made on\r\nTinicum Island, now Essington, not far distant from the mouth of Darby\r\nCreek on the Delaware River. The beautiful buildings of the Corinthian\r\nYacht Club are now located on this historic spot.\r\n\r\nA monument was unveiled June 14, 1923, to mark the place where the first\r\npermanent settlement in what is now Pennsylvania was made. This shaft\r\nwas erected by the Swedish Colonial Society and was unveiled by Miss\r\nNancy J. Paxson, tenth in descent from one of the original founders of\r\nthe colony.\r\n\r\nHere it was that Colonel John Printz, a Swedish military officer of\r\nnote, who had recently been knighted by the Swedish Government for the\r\nconspicuous role he enacted in the Thirty Years’ War, accompanied by a\r\nfew adventurers of the same nationality, located in 1643, erected a fort\r\nof green logs and named the settlement he founded New Gottenberg. The\r\nfort was mounted with four cannon. Provisions were made for the planting\r\nof corn and tobacco.\r\n\r\nA short time thereafter Printz built a pretentious mansion on Tinicum\r\nIsland, “very splendid,” with an orchard and pleasure house, and it bore\r\nthe name of Printz Hof or Printz Hall. This mansion house was two\r\nstories high and built of hewn logs, while two or more fireplaces and\r\novens were made of bricks imported from Sweden for that purpose. There\r\nwere even glass windows. The utensils were of copper and tin. Their\r\nlight was candle. Printz Hall also contained a fine library and every\r\nconvenience known at that period. This great house stood 160 years, when\r\nit was accidentally destroyed by fire.\r\n\r\nPrintz planted orchards, cleared fields and firmly established himself\r\non the place he determined should be the seat of government for the\r\nSwedish colony on the South River, as the Delaware was then known.\r\n\r\nPrintz sent Maus Kling, the engineer for the colony, to make a\r\nsettlement on the Schuylkill. Log houses were built there, and Kling\r\nbuilt on the east bank of the Schuylkill, near its mouth, probably on\r\nwhat was afterward called Providence Island, a small fort which was\r\ncalled New Korsholm.\r\n\r\nThese operations of Kling, the plantation and the fort, form the first\r\nauthenticated occupancy by Europeans of the site of the City of\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\nOn April 17, 1640, the Swedish ship Kalmer Nyckel sailed into the\r\nChristiana Creek. Among the immigrants was the Reverend Reorus\r\nTorkillus, a clergyman of the Swedish Lutheran Church, who thus became\r\nthe first minister of the gospel on the Delaware River. Soon after this\r\npreacher’s arrival in the colony a meeting house was built, in which the\r\nservices of the Lutheran Church were conducted.\r\n\r\nGovernor Printz built a church on Tinicum Island, which had a bell and\r\nbelfry. It was succeeded by a more imposing and commodious edifice in\r\n1646, built of logs, with a roof of clapboards and an altar with a\r\nsilver cloth. This church was dedicated by the Reverend John Campanius\r\non September 4, 1646.\r\n\r\nPrintz reported to his home Government he had the church finished and\r\ndedicated, “adorning and decorating it according to our Swedish fashion,\r\nso far as our limited means and resources would allow.”\r\n\r\nThere was a graveyard located adjacent to the church, in which was\r\ninterred the corpse of Andrew Hanson’s daughter Catherine, who was\r\nburied October 28, 1646. This was the first burial of any European in\r\nPennsylvania, certainly the first in any regularly established cemetery.\r\n\r\nThe marriage of Governor Printz’s daughter, Armegot, to Johan Papegoja,\r\nthe commandant at Fort Christina, was solemnized in this old church at\r\nTinicum, in 1644, and it is believed to have been the first instance in\r\nwhich a matrimonial ceremony was performed between Europeans within the\r\nlimits of the present State of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe Old Swedes’ Church called the worshippers together with the sound of\r\nthe first “church-going bell” on the American Continent. But in May,\r\n1673, Armegot Papegoja was in such dire distress for funds that she sold\r\nthe bell to the congregation of the adherents of the Augsburg\r\nConfession, at Laus Deo.\r\n\r\nThe worshippers believed this bell should be nowhere but in their own\r\nSwedes’ Church and they determined to repurchase it, when the members of\r\nthe congregation gave their labor for two years at harvest time as the\r\nconsideration. The bell was brought back to Tinicum, but the facts\r\nrelating to its subsequent history are lacking.[6]\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  Colonel Henry D. Paxon says this original bell was recast, with some\r\n  additional metal, and now hangs in “Gloria Dei,” Old Swedes’ Church,\r\n  Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nIt is quite probable that this Old Swedes’ Church remained the active\r\ncenter for worship long after the Swedes were swept from power on the\r\nDelaware.\r\n\r\nPeter Stuyvesant, at the head of a large fleet and formidable\r\nexpedition, September, 1654, captured Fort Cassimer, or Trinity, as the\r\nSwedes called it, then after a siege of fourteen days compelled the\r\nsurrender of Fort Christina, which was defended by Governor Johan\r\nClaesson Rysingh.\r\n\r\nIn the articles of capitulation, which were formally drawn up and signed\r\nSeptember 25 by the two commanders on the “parade ground” outside the\r\nfort, it was agreed that the Swedish soldiers were to march out with the\r\nhonors of war.\r\n\r\nThe “guns, ammunition, implements, victuals and other effects belonging\r\nto the Crown of Sweden and to the South Company,” in the fort or its\r\nvicinity, were to remain their property. The Swedish settlers might stay\r\nor go, as they chose, and for a year and six weeks, if they stayed, need\r\nnot take the Dutch oath of allegiance. Swedes who remained should enjoy\r\nthe Lutheran faith, the “liberty of the Augsburg Confession,” and have a\r\nminister to instruct them.\r\n\r\nWhen the English came to the South River in the fall of 1664, the Swedes\r\nat Tinicum still were worshiping in their Lutheran Church.\r\n\r\nAfter the departure of Governor Rysingh, in 1653, there was only one\r\nminister among the Swedes on the river, the man who was variously called\r\nLaers, Laurentius Carolus, Lock, Lokenius, etc., was a poor fellow whose\r\nmissteps and mischances, moral lapses and legal misdemeanors are\r\nrepeatedly mentioned in the scanty chronicles of the time. He preached\r\nin the Swedes’ Church at Tinicum and at Crane Hook, between Christina\r\nand New Castle, where a log church was built about 1667. Lock died in\r\n1688.\r\n\r\nWhen Governor Andros visited the Delaware, in 1675, the New Castle Court\r\ndecreed, when designating places of meeting for worship, “that the\r\nchurch at Tinicum Island do serve for Upland and parts adjacent.”\r\n\r\nGreat Tinicum Island stands with Jamestown and Plymouth as one of the\r\nbirthplaces of America.\r\n\r\nLewis, in the history of Chester County, says that the Swedes came from\r\nNew Castle and places along the Delaware, both above and below, to\r\nworship in that building.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the settlement at Upland, now Chester, began to thrive,\r\nand it was not long before it became a more important place than\r\nTinicum.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  First Continental Congress Meets in\r\n                    Carpenters’ Hall, Philadelphia,\r\n                           September 5, 1774\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Assembly of Pennsylvania promptly responded to the “Instructions” of\r\nthe great meeting of the Provincial deputies held in the State House\r\nJuly 15, 1774, and appointed Joseph Galloway, speaker, Samuel Rhoads,\r\nThomas Mifflin, John Morton, Charles Humphreys, George Ross, Edward\r\nBiddle, and, subsequently, John Dickinson as delegates to the Congress\r\nto be held in Philadelphia in September.\r\n\r\nThis body assembled September 5 in Carpenters’ Hall and chose Peyton\r\nRandolph, of Virginia, president, and Charles Thomson, of Pennsylvania,\r\nsecretary, of what proved to be the first Continental Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of Rights was agreed upon. This claimed, first, as\r\nnatural rights, the enjoyment of life, liberty and fortune; secondly,\r\nthey claimed, as British subjects, to be bound by no law to which they\r\nhad not consented by their chosen representatives. They denied to\r\nParliament all power of taxation and vested the right of legislation in\r\ntheir own Assemblies.\r\n\r\nThe common law of England they declared to be their birthright,\r\nincluding the rights of trial by jury of the vicinage, of public\r\nmeetings and petition. They protested against the maintenance in the\r\nColonies of standing armies without their full consent, and against all\r\nlegislation by councils depending on the Crown.\r\n\r\nHaving thus proclaimed their rights, they calmly enumerated the various\r\nacts which had been passed in derogation of them. There were eleven in\r\nnumber, passed in as many years—the Sugar Act, the Stamp Act, the Tea\r\nAct, those which provided for the quartering of troops, for the\r\nsupersedure of the New York Legislature, for the trial in Great Britain\r\nof offenses committed in America, for the regulation of the government\r\nof Massachusetts, for the closing of the port of Boston, and the last\r\nstraw, known as the Quebec bill.\r\n\r\nOn October 18, articles of confederation were adopted, the signing of\r\nwhich, two days afterward, should be regarded as the commencement of the\r\nAmerican Union, based upon freedom and equality.\r\n\r\nOn October 26, an address to the people of Great Britain was adopted,\r\nalso a memorial to the inhabitants of British America, and a loyal\r\naddress to His Majesty. The Congress then adjourned to meet in\r\nPhiladelphia on the 10th of May following.\r\n\r\nDickinson was a powerful member of this first Congress, his master hand\r\nbeing first employed in the “Address to the inhabitants of Quebec,”\r\nforwarded under date of October 26. This address set forth the reasons\r\nwhy the people of that province should join with those of the Colonies\r\nin their political interests.\r\n\r\nOver the Pennsylvania delegation Galloway, with his wealth, education\r\nand political prestige, and with some claim on their gratitude as their\r\nadvocate against the Proprietaries, was both presiding officer and\r\npresiding genius. His influence was clearly seen in the selection of\r\ndelegates, for both Dickinson and Wilson were omitted in the original\r\nlist. The failure to name Mr. Dickinson was a grave error, but was\r\ncorrected when Mayor Rhoads could not serve.\r\n\r\nAs Congress assembled Galloway did the honors, but his conduct soon\r\nrevealed him acting as a volunteer spy for the British Government, and\r\nhe did everything in his power to exert a control over the first\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nHe even went so far as to hold secret meetings with the Governor of New\r\nJersey and the Lieutenant Governor of New York, when he proposed in\r\nCongress a government for America to consist of a President General\r\nappointed by the King, and holding office during his pleasure, and a\r\nGrand Council chosen once in three years by the assemblies of the\r\nvarious colonies, the members thereof to be apportioned according to\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nHis celebrated scheme was not popular, but in presenting it to Congress,\r\nsaid: “I am as much a friend to liberty as exists, and no man shall go\r\nfurther in point of fortune or in point of blood than the man who now\r\naddresses you.”\r\n\r\nThe plan was favored by New York and South Carolina and on final vote\r\nwas rejected by the close vote of six colonies against five. “With this\r\ndefeat,” says Bancroft, “Galloway lost his mischievous importance.”\r\n\r\nAt the October election Galloway was re-elected to the Assembly, but the\r\nmany changes in the membership foretold the decided advancement of the\r\nWhigs. Edward Biddle was elected Speaker. Galloway did not attend until\r\nafter the report of the preceding Congress had been made.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly of Pennsylvania, which met on December 8, 1774, was the\r\nfirst Provincial Legislature to which report of the congressional\r\nproceedings was made. The Assembly unanimously approved them December\r\n15, and recommended them to the inviolable observance of the people.\r\nThis body then appointed Messrs. Biddle, Dickinson, Mifflin, Galloway,\r\nHumphreys, Morton and Ross as delegates to the new Congress. Mr. Samuel\r\nRhoads, who was then the Mayor of Philadelphia, was too occupied with\r\nthose duties and was omitted from this delegation.\r\n\r\nUpon the return of Benjamin Franklin from London, he was immediately\r\nadded to the congressional delegation, together with Messrs. James\r\nWilson and Thomas Willing. Mr. Galloway, who had repeatedly requested to\r\nbe excused from serving, was permitted to withdraw. Galloway had become\r\ntoo much alarmed at the length to which the opposition to the mother\r\ncountry was carried.\r\n\r\nHitherto Governor John Penn had looked upon the proceedings of the\r\nAssembly without attempting to direct or control them. He was supposed\r\nto favor the efforts made in support of American principles; but now a\r\nsemblance of regard to the instructions of the Crown induced him to\r\nremonstrate in mild terms against the continental system of petition and\r\nremonstrance.\r\n\r\nIn England the proceedings of the Americans were viewed with great\r\nindignation by the King and his ministry, and the petition of Congress,\r\nalthough declared by the Secretary of State, after a day’s perusal, “to\r\nbe decent and proper and received graciously by His Majesty, did not\r\nreceive much favor at the hands of the ministry, which resolved to\r\ncompel the obedience of the Americans.”\r\n\r\nThe remonstrances of three millions of people were therefore treated,\r\nperhaps believed, as the clamors of an unruly multitude.\r\n\r\nBoth houses of Parliament joined in an address to the King, declaring\r\n“that they find a rebellion actually exists in the Province of\r\nMassachusetts.” That was followed by an act for restraining the trade\r\nand commerce of the New England Provinces and prohibiting them from\r\ncarrying on the fisheries on the banks of Newfoundland, which was\r\nsubsequently extended to New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia,\r\nSouth Carolina and the Lower Counties on the Delaware.\r\n\r\nConciliatory measures were introduced in Parliament, which provided a\r\nrelief from tax or duties for those colonies which would yield strict\r\nobedience to the laws of the mother country. This proposition was\r\nopposed as an admission of the correctness of the American views. Upon\r\nPennsylvania’s reply to the resolutions of Parliament much depended, and\r\nthe Assembly acted promptly and with unanimity.\r\n\r\nBy reason of Edward Biddle’s illness, John Morton was elected Speaker,\r\nMarch 15, 1775.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Fort Montgomery Withstands Attack of\r\n                 British and Indians, September 6, 1780\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the Revolution the settlers on the frontiers\r\nsuffered much at the hands of the Indians, and this was particularly\r\ntrue in the region of the Susquehanna valleys. A chain of forts or\r\nblockhouses was established from Fort Jenkins on the North Branch of the\r\nSusquehanna, about midway between the present towns of Berwick and\r\nBloomsburg, to Fort Reid, in the present borough of Lock Haven.\r\n\r\nEach of these forts was garrisoned by troops from large Fort Augusta at\r\nthe forks of the Susquehanna, and each in its turn was attacked by\r\nIndians or by British and Indians, during the period of the Revolution,\r\nand all but one or two of them were destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe most important attack on any of the above forts occurred July 28,\r\n1779, when the British under Captain John MacDonald and Seneca Indians,\r\nunder Chief Hiakatoo, defeated the garrison at Fort Freeland, took all\r\nthe men and boys prisoners and destroyed the fort. This story is told on\r\nJuly 28.\r\n\r\nIn 1769, William Patterson patented 700 acres of land in what is now\r\nLewis Township, Northumberland County, which he named Paradise. Two\r\nyears later he sold his Paradise farm to John Montgomery, of Paxtang,\r\nand removed to White Deer Creek, to reside with his daughter, Mrs.\r\nHunter. John Montgomery established his family at Paradise, and his\r\ndescendants still reside in that beautiful valley.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the battle at Fort Freeland, John Montgomery heard the\r\nfiring, mounted two of his young sons on horses and sent them to the top\r\nof a hill to learn the cause of the shooting. They soon discovered the\r\nfort on fire and a fight raging in the timber below them. They hurriedly\r\nreturned and reported what they had seen, when their father loaded his\r\nfamily in a wagon, with what provisions and clothing they could carry,\r\nand rapidly drove across the country to the cabin of Philip Davis, on\r\nChillisquaque Creek, near the present village of Pottsgrove. Davis\r\ngathered up his family and together they hurriedly journeyed to Fort\r\nAugusta, then down the river to Paxtang, where they remained until after\r\nthe war was closed.\r\n\r\nThe precaution of Montgomery was intuitive, for the victorious British\r\nand Indians soon reached Paradise and burned his home and buildings.\r\n\r\nWith Fort Freeland destroyed and Montgomery’s home in ruins, it was\r\nnecessary that one of these places be immediately rebuilt and fortified.\r\n\r\nA detachment of the German Regiment, then in that vicinity, was sent to\r\nParadise under command of Captain John Rice, and in the winter of\r\n1779–80 they built a stockade around a fine spring of water, which forms\r\nthe headwaters of Muddy Run. This was built permanently out of limestone\r\nfound in that locality and today is in an excellent state of\r\npreservation and used by the tenant of the farm.\r\n\r\nAfter completing this real fort they ably defended it, as an attack took\r\nplace there early in September, 1780, which is told in a letter written\r\nby Colonel Samuel Hunter, county lieutenant, dated Fort Augusta,\r\nSeptember 21, 1780, as follows:\r\n\r\n“We were alarmed by a large party of the enemy making their appearance\r\nin our county on the 6th inst. They came first to a small fort that\r\nColonel Weltner’s troops had erected on the headwaters of the\r\nChillisquaque, calling it Fort Rice, about thirteen miles from Sunbury.\r\n(Three errors: Headwaters of Muddy Run; should be Fort Montgomery, the\r\nowner and original builder, and not Fort Rice, just because such a\r\nsoldier was in charge of the detail, and the distance is seventeen miles\r\nfrom Sunbury, or about four from Milton).\r\n\r\n“When the German Regiment marched off the enemy attacked the fort about\r\nsundown, and fired very smartly. The garrison returned the fire with\r\nspirit, which made them withdraw a little off, and in the night they\r\nbegan to set fire to a number of houses and stacks of grain which they\r\nconsumed.\r\n\r\n“In the meantime our militia had collected to the number of one hundred\r\nmen under command of Colonel John Kelly, who marched to the relief of\r\nthe garrison, and arrived there next day. The people of the garrison\r\nacquainted Colonel Kelly that there must be two hundred and fifty or\r\nthree Hundred of the Enimy, which he did not think prudent to engage\r\nwithout being Reinforced. The confusion this put the inhabitants in, it\r\nwas not easy to collect a party equal to fight the savages.\r\n\r\n“I immediately sent off an express to Col. Purdy on Juniata whom I heard\r\nwas marching to the Frontiers of Cumberland County with the militia, he\r\ncame as quick as possible to our assistance with one Hundred and ten of\r\nthe militia and about Eighty Volunteers, which was no small\r\nReinforcement to us.\r\n\r\n“Genl. Potter just coming home from camp at this critical time came up\r\nto Sunbury and took command of the party that went in Quest of the\r\nEnimy. But previous to his marching, discharged the Volunteers as he\r\nconcluded by the information he had received from spyes we had out that\r\nthe enemy did not exceed one Hundred and fifty and that they had\r\nwithdrawn from the inhabitants to some Remote place.\r\n\r\n“General Potter, However, marched on to Muncy Hills, but was a little\r\nbaffled by the information to their route and did not come on their\r\ntrack till the 13th and followed on about 50 miles up Fishing Creek, the\r\nroad the enemy took, but finding they had got too far ahead returned\r\nhere the 17th inst. The enemy got but one scalp and one prisoner.\r\n(Colonel Hunter did not know of the Sugar Loaf Massacre when he wrote.)\r\n\r\n“We all concluded the enimy had got off, but on the 18th there was a\r\nsmall party made their appearance on the West Branch about fourteen\r\nmiles above this place, they killed one man and wounded another, and\r\nkilled their horses they had in the plow, which plainly shows they have\r\nscattered into small parties to Harass the inhabitants, which I am\r\nafraid will prevent the people from getting crops put in the ground this\r\nfall.\r\n\r\n“When the German Regiment marched off from here I gave orders for the\r\nFrontier’s Companys to embody and keep one-fourth of the men Constantly\r\nReconnoitering.\r\n\r\n“After garrisoning Fort Jenkins, Fort Rice and Fort Swartz with twenty\r\nmen in each of them, this was the only method I could think of\r\nencouraging the people as we were left to our own exertions. Only about\r\nthirty of Capt. McCoy’s company of Volunteers from Cumberland County,\r\nuntil the 10 inst., that two companies of militia came here from the\r\nsame county in the whole about eighty men.\r\n\r\n“When I received the intelligence of a large party of savages and tories\r\ncoming against Fort Rice, I gave orders to evacuate Fort Jenkins as I\r\ndid not look upon it to be tenable, which is since burned by the Enimy,\r\nand would have shared the same had the men staid there on act. of the\r\nBuildings, that were adjoining it, etc.”\r\n\r\nJohn Montgomery and his family returned after peace was declared.\r\nFinding the buildings of his farm destroyed and a good, strong stone\r\nhouse supplying its place, he at once occupied the fort, which, with\r\nadditions, made him a comfortable home for years.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Colonel Hartley Leads Expedition Against\r\n                        Six Nation Indians—Born\r\n                           September 7, 1746\r\n\r\n\r\nColonel Thomas Hartley, who was one of the most prominent Pennsylvanians\r\nduring the period of the Revolution, was born in Colebrookdale Township,\r\nBerks County, Pennsylvania, September 7, 1746.\r\n\r\nHe was the son of George Hartley, a well-to-do farmer, who was able to\r\ngive his son a good classical education at Reading. At the age of\r\neighteen he began to read law in the office of Samuel Johnson, at York,\r\na prominent lawyer and relative of his mother. He was admitted to\r\npractice in the courts of York County July 25, 1769, and in the courts\r\nof Philadelphia a month later. He rose rapidly in his profession, and\r\nwas enjoying a lucrative practice when the War for Independence opened.\r\n\r\nHe served on the Committee of Observation for York County in 1774–75; he\r\nrepresented York County as a deputy in the Provincial Conference held at\r\nPhiladelphia July 15, 1774, and in the Provincial Convention, January\r\n23, 1775.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1774, he was chosen first lieutenant of Captain James\r\nSmith’s company of Associators and a year later lieutenant colonel of\r\nthe First Battalion of York County. He was elected by Committee of\r\nSafety January 10, 1776, to be lieutenant colonel of the Sixth\r\nBattalion, commanded by Colonel William Irvine, of Carlisle, and served\r\nwith distinction in the Canadian campaign.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1776, Congress authorized General Washington to raise\r\nsixteen battalions of infantry additional to those in service, and the\r\ncommand of one of these was given to Colonel Hartley.\r\n\r\nIn the campaign for the defense of Philadelphia Hartley’s regiment bore\r\na conspicuous part. At the Battles of Brandywine and Germantown it was\r\nattached to the First Philadelphia Brigade, of General Wayne’s division,\r\nColonel Hartley commanding the brigade, and was also at Paoli.\r\n\r\nTo repel the inroads of the Tories and Indians from New York and for the\r\nprotection of the frontiers following the “Great Runaway,” Colonel\r\nHartley and his regiment, July 14, 1778, were ordered to Sunbury. The\r\norder continues:\r\n\r\n“A detachment of Colonel Hartley’s Regiment to march from New Jersey to\r\nEaston, there to join Colonel Kowatz, who has under his command a small\r\nnumber of horse. The remainder of Colonel Hartley’s Reg’t, now in\r\nPhilad’a, to march immediately to Sunbury and join the Two Companies\r\nlately raised at Wioming. Col. Brodhead’s Regiment, now on their march\r\nto Pittsburgh, to be ordered to the Standing Stone. But it is necessary\r\nto add to these Continental troops a considerable body of Militia.\r\nCouncil have therefore determined to order to Sunbury three hundred\r\nMilitia from the County of Northumberland, four hundred from the County\r\nof Lancaster & one hundred and fifty from the County of Berks.”\r\n\r\nThe troops at Standing Stone and Easton were also to be re-enforced by\r\nmilitia.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement for the frontier defense was intended to rendezvous at\r\nSunbury 1050 troops, as follows: Part of Hartley’s Regiment at\r\nPhiladelphia, 100; two companies recruited at Wyoming, 100; militia from\r\nLancaster County, 400; from Berks, 150, and Northumberland, 300.\r\n\r\nOn July 16 the Board of War advised Council that they learned by letters\r\nthat General McIntosh, who was at Carlisle, hearing of the Indian\r\nincursions, ordered Colonel Brodhead, then on his way to Fort Pitt, to\r\nhurry his Eighth Pennsylvania Regiment to the Susquehanna, “to stop the\r\nprogress of the enemy & encourage the militia to stand in their own\r\ndefence.”\r\n\r\nThen General J. P. DeHaas, who was stationed at Lebanon, sent an express\r\nto Colonel Samuel Hunter, at Fort Augusta, to learn the exact situation,\r\nwhen he offered his services to the Board of War.\r\n\r\nColonel Brodhead and the Eighth Pennsylvania Regiment arrived at Fort\r\nAugusta and soon as the colonel learned he could not be of assistance\r\nthere, he took up his march and arrived at Fort Muncy July 23, and\r\nimmediately sent out scouting parties in every direction.\r\n\r\nWhen Colonel Hartley and 300 of his command arrived at Fort Augusta,\r\nGeneral John P. DeHaas was already there and had assumed command.\r\n\r\nGeneral James Potter wrote from Fort Augusta August 1, 1778: “I came\r\nhere last week to station the militia. I found General DeHaas here, who\r\nsaid he commanded all the troops. The next day Colonel Hartley came and\r\nshowed me his orders to command the troops, and politely requested me to\r\ntake the command, which I declined, as I never was very fond of command,\r\nand this is a disagreeable one.”\r\n\r\nColonel Hartley wrote to Council from Fort Augusta August 1, advising\r\nthe conditions when he arrived, and that General DeHaas, who was in\r\ncommand, had given the command to him. Hartley gave a very correct\r\nstatement of the distressed situation following the great Wyoming\r\nMassacre of July 3.\r\n\r\nSoon as Colonel Hartley arrived at Fort Muncy, Colonel Brodhead led his\r\ntroops off toward Fort Pitt, via Carlisle, and Colonel Hartley settled\r\ndown to the difficult task of handling the unfortunate conditions on\r\nthat harassed frontier.\r\n\r\nColonel Hartley’s men built Fort Muncy. It was about a half a mile above\r\nthe present Hall’s Station, on the Philadelphia and Reading Railway, in\r\nLycoming County, a few hundred yards directly in front of the famous\r\nHall’s Stone House, built in 1769. It was intended to be the most\r\nimportant stronghold, next to Fort Augusta, on the West Branch of the\r\nSusquehanna.\r\n\r\nColonel Hartley immediately planned an expedition against the Indians,\r\nas he believed the way to successfully combat the savage foe was to\r\ncarry the war into his own country.\r\n\r\nHe marched from Fort Muncy, September 18, with two hundred troops and\r\ntwelve days’ rations. In his report to Congress, the Colonel says: “In\r\nour route we met with great rains and prodigious swamps, mountains,\r\ndefiles and rocks which impeded our march, we had to open and clear the\r\nway as we passed.\r\n\r\n“We waded or swam the River Lycoming upward of twenty times. In lonely\r\nwoods and groves we found where the Indians had dressed and dried scalps\r\nof the frontier victims. On the morning of the 26th, the advance party\r\nmet nineteen Indians in a skirmish. An important Indian chief was killed\r\nand scalped.” They burnt Tioga, Queen Esther’s Town and other\r\nsettlements.\r\n\r\nColonel Hartley performed the marvelous feat of marching his small army\r\n300 miles and fighting several severe battles with Indians and Tories in\r\ntwo weeks; bringing in fifty head of cattle, twenty-eight canoes and\r\nmuch plunder and above all else rendered such signal service to the\r\nfrontiers that the settlers could return to their habitations and\r\nharvest their crops in safety.\r\n\r\nBoth the Provincial Council and the Continental Congress, Nov. 14, 1778,\r\nadopted resolutions of commendation to Colonel Hartley for the success\r\nof his expedition.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Colonel John Armstrong Destroyed Indian\r\n                  Town of Kittanning September 8, 1756\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore Governor Robert Morris was superseded by William Denny he\r\nconcerted with Colonel John Armstrong an expedition against the Indian\r\ntown of Kittanning, on the Allegheny, the stronghold of Captains Jacobs\r\nand Shingas, the most active Indian chiefs, and from which place they\r\ndistributed their war parties along the frontier.\r\n\r\nWhen Governor Denny assumed the office of Governor his predecessor\r\ncommunicated to him his plans for this expedition, which were favorably\r\nreceived by the Governor and his Council.\r\n\r\nThe details of this enterprise had been perfected in great secrecy. It\r\nis quite likely that Colonel Armstrong was selected for this purpose,\r\nnot only on account of his well-known military prowess, but for the\r\nfurther fact that his beloved brother, Lieutenant Edward Armstrong, had\r\nbeen killed in the attack and destruction of Fort Granville, and for the\r\nmany other depredations which the Indians had committed in the Juniata\r\nValley.\r\n\r\nColonel Armstrong collected his forces at Fort Shirley, at Aughwick, now\r\nHuntingdon County, consisting of 300 troops, divided into seven\r\ncompanies. Among the captains were James Hamilton, Hugh Mercer, Edward\r\nNord and James Potter, all afterward distinguished officers of the\r\nRevolution and leading citizens of the State.\r\n\r\nOn September 2, 1756, he came up with the advanced party at “Beaver\r\nDams,” a few miles south of Frankstown, on the north branch of the\r\nJuniata. Here the little army struck the celebrated Kittanning path,\r\nwell trodden by Indians in their travels to the westward.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th, the evening, within six miles of Kittanning, the scouts\r\ndiscovered a fire in the road, and four Indians about it, but these\r\ncould not be attacked, as one or more might escape and alarm the town.\r\nLieutenant Hogg and twelve men were left to watch them, with orders to\r\nfall upon them at daybreak. The main body then made a circuit and\r\nproceeded to the village.\r\n\r\nGuided by the whooping of the Indians at a dance, the army approached\r\nthe place by the river, about 100 perches below the town. They arrived\r\nat 3 o’clock on the morning of the 8th near a cornfield in which some of\r\nthe enemy were lodged, sleeping in the open on account of the excessive\r\nheat of the weather.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the dawn of the new day made the town visible the troops\r\nattacked it through the cornfield, killing several of the enemy. The men\r\nwere wearied by a forced march of thirty miles and had been aroused from\r\nsound sleep to make the attack, but they fought with great eagerness.\r\n\r\nWhen the firing began Captain Jacobs immediately sounded the war whoop,\r\nand with a number of Indians, as the English prisoners afterward told\r\nColonel Armstrong, cried: “The white men are at last come, we will soon\r\nhave scalps enough,” but at the same time ordered their squaws and\r\nchildren to flee to the woods.\r\n\r\nCaptain Jacobs defended his house bravely and through loopholes in the\r\nlogs a deadly fire was poured into the provincial troops.\r\n\r\nThe Indians refused quarter, saying they were men and would not be\r\nprisoners. At this point Colonel Armstrong turned his attention to the\r\nhouses from which the Indians were making such a stand. He received a\r\nbad wound in his shoulder, but continued to direct the attack. He found\r\nthe houses must be destroyed, and ordered the contiguous buildings set\r\non fire, which was performed by his officers and soldiers with much\r\ndispatch.\r\n\r\nThe Indians fired at every moving object and as their aim was deadly\r\nmany soldiers were killed or wounded.\r\n\r\nSoon as the buildings were set on fire the Indians were given another\r\nopportunity to surrender themselves prisoners, but again they refused.\r\nOne Indian declared he did not care for death; he could kill four or\r\nfive more before he died, and some began to sing as the flames burned\r\nnear them. The few who burst from the burning buildings and ran for the\r\nriver were shot down by the soldiers.\r\n\r\nCaptain Jacobs was shot as he attempted to get out of an upper window.\r\nArmstrong’s soldiers identified the powder horn and pouch he wore as one\r\nhe had lately received from a French officer in exchange for Lieutenant\r\nEdward Armstrong’s boots, which he carried from Fort Granville, where\r\nthe lieutenant was killed.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers got the scalp of the great Indian chief, as they also did\r\nof his squaw and a young Indian, called the “King’s Son.”\r\n\r\nBefore this time Captain Hugh Mercer had been severely wounded in the\r\narm and was carried to the top of the hill above the town, where a\r\nnumber of the wounded men gathered. These soon discovered from their\r\nelevated position that Indians were passing the river and taking to the\r\nhills, they thought with the intention of surrounding and cutting off\r\nthe troops from any possible retreat. Colonel Armstrong would not\r\nbelieve this their design, but sent men in every direction to keep him\r\nposted upon the enemy’s movements. The Indians in their hasty retreat\r\nleft behind a number of English scalps and not a few white prisoners.\r\n\r\nInstead of cutting down the cornfield, the colonel immediately assembled\r\nthe wounded and loaded them upon the few Indian horses which they had\r\ncollected.\r\n\r\nThe return march was slow and tedious, made so by the many wounded and\r\nthe constant watch necessary to prevent a surprise attack from ambush.\r\nCaptain Mercer was carried by some of his men over a different road and\r\nColonel Armstrong was alarmed for his safety.\r\n\r\nColonel Armstrong in his report of the action at Kittanning said he\r\ncould not estimate the loss of the enemy, as many were burned in the\r\nbuildings, but he could account for thirty or forty killed. They brought\r\nback a dozen scalps and eleven English prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe loss sustained by the provincial forces was seventeen killed,\r\nthirteen wounded and nineteen missing. All the wounded recovered and all\r\nbut two of the missing reached their homes.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the horrible Indian massacres which followed Braddock’s\r\ndefeat, Drake in his Indian history, says:\r\n\r\n“Shingas and Captain Jacobs were supposed to have been the principal\r\ninstigators of them, and a reward of $700 was offered for their heads.“\r\n\r\nKing Shingas was the greatest Delaware warrior at that time. Heckwelder,\r\nwho knew him personally, says:\r\n\r\n“Were his war exploits all on record they would form an interesting\r\ndocument, though a shocking one.”\r\n\r\nKing Shingas happened to be at Fort Duquesne when Colonel Armstrong\r\ndestroyed Kittanning.\r\n\r\nThe Corporation of Philadelphia, on the occasion of Colonel Armstrong’s\r\nvictory, addressed a complimentary letter to him, January 5 following,\r\nthanking him and his officers for their gallant conduct and presented\r\nhim with a piece of plate.\r\n\r\nMany descendants of the gallant Colonel Armstrong are living today and\r\nwell may they be proud of such a distinguished ancestor.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Franklin County Erected from Part\r\n                          of Cumberland County\r\n                           September 9, 1784\r\n\r\n\r\nOn January 27, 1759, Lancaster County was divided by act of Assembly,\r\nand the southern division thereof erected into a new county, to which\r\nthe name of “Cumberland” was given, with the town of Carlisle as the\r\nseat of justice.\r\n\r\nFor a quarter of a century the county of Cumberland thus constituted,\r\nremained intact, when the wants of the southwestern part, known as the\r\nConocheague settlement, led them to petition the General Assembly of\r\n1784 that their territory might be set apart as a new county, with\r\nconcomitant privileges setting forth in glowing terms the hardships they\r\nwere compelled to endure traveling the long distance from their homes to\r\nthe seat of justice at Carlisle, etc.\r\n\r\nThe General Assembly complied therewith and September 9, 1784, erected\r\nthe new county to be named “Franklin,” in honor of the great\r\nPennsylvanian, Benjamin Franklin.\r\n\r\nBy 1790 some doubts arose as to the correct boundary, and March 29, in\r\nthat year, a re-adjustment of the lines was made by running a new line\r\nso as to leave the entire tract of land owned by Edward Shippen, of\r\nLancaster, and upon which Shippensburg now stands, in Cumberland County.\r\n\r\nOn March 29, 1798, a portion of the then county of Bedford, known as the\r\n“Little Cove” was detached from that county and annexed to Franklin, and\r\nthe county thus erected is the Franklin County of today.\r\n\r\nBy the terms of the act establishing the county of Franklin, James\r\nMaxwell, James McCalmont, Josiah Crawford, David Stoner, and John\r\nJohnson were appointed trustees on behalf of the county, and were\r\ndirected to procure two lots of ground in the town of Chambersburg or\r\nChamberstown, for seats of a court house and of a county gaol.\r\n\r\nThe original court house was a brick building of two stories, surmounted\r\nby a tall conical cupola and a spire. In the belfry was suspended a bell\r\nof Spanish make, which had rendered service in an old convent.\r\n\r\nThe first court in Franklin County was held September 15, 1784. As the\r\ncourt house was not yet completed this first session was convened in the\r\nstone house on the corner of the “square,” which was built by John Jack\r\nin 1770. This historic building stood until July 30, 1864, when the\r\nrebel horde burned the town during the Civil War.\r\n\r\nThe first court was held before Judges Humphrey Fullerton Thomas\r\nJohnston and James Findley. Edward Crawford, Jr., was prothonotary.\r\nJeremiah Talbot was commissioned sheriff October 20, 1784.\r\n\r\nThe following named persons sat as the first grand jury: James Poe,\r\nHenry Pawling, William Allison, William McDowell, Robert Wilkins, John\r\nMcConnell, John McCarny, John Ray, John Jack, Jr., John Dickson, D.\r\nMcClintock, Joseph Chambers, and Joseph Long.\r\n\r\nAs late as 1748 there were many Indians within the present limits of\r\nFranklin County. The first settlers of Franklin County were\r\nScotch-Irish, many of whose descendants yet remain, but the larger\r\nproportion migrated west or south, giving way before the German element\r\ncoming from the eastern counties of the state.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that Joseph and Benjamin Chambers located at the Falling\r\nSpring earlier than 1730. They had previously built at Fort Hunter,\r\nabove Harrisburg, on the Susquehanna, but an accidental fire consumed\r\ntheir mill on the Fishing Creek, and they wandered westward, finally\r\nlocated at Falling Spring, where they erected a log house, and\r\neventually a saw and grist mill.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Chambers maintained a friendly intercourse with the Indians in\r\nhis vicinity. They became attached to him; with them he traded, and had\r\nso much of their confidence and respect that they did not injure him or\r\noffer to molest him.\r\n\r\nAfter Braddock’s defeat July, 1755, the Western Indians became so\r\ntroublesome, and made so many incursions east of the mountains, that\r\nColonel Chambers, for the security of his family and his neighbors,\r\nerected a large stone dwelling house, where Chambersburg now is. This\r\nhouse was surrounded by water from Falling Spring, and, to prevent the\r\nIndians from setting it on fire, the roof was made of lead. The\r\ndwelling, buildings and mill were surrounded with a stockade.\r\n\r\nThis fort was provided with a blunderbluss and swivel, and the garrison\r\nhad an ample supply of smaller firearms. The Indians seldom assaulted\r\nthis fort and none of its defenders was killed or carried off.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Chambers reported the terrible massacre at Great Cove, Sunday\r\nmorning, November 2, 1755. He wrote: “If you intend to go to the\r\nassistance of your neighbors, you need wait no longer for the certainty\r\nof the news. The Great Cove is destroyed.”\r\n\r\nThe Great Cove was burned by the Indians and fifty-seven persons out of\r\nninety-three settlers were killed or taken captive.\r\n\r\nA record of the persons killed or taken captive by the Indians during\r\nthis period until the close of the Revolution reveals a long list of\r\nsavage cruelty.\r\n\r\nIn the war of 1812–14, Franklin County played an important part. Eight\r\ncompanies were mustered in the county; Chambersburg furnished four,\r\nGreencastle, Mercersburg, Waynesboro and Path Valley, each one.\r\n\r\nDuring the Civil War Franklin County suffered as did no other border\r\ncounty of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nFirst came the great Confederate raid in October, 1862, led by Generals\r\nJ. E. B. Stuart and Wade Hampton; then during General Lee’s invasion,\r\nJune, 1863; and finally General McCausland’s invasion when the town of\r\nChambersburg was sacked and burned July 30, 1864. The scenes presented\r\non the latter terrible occasion beggar description.\r\n\r\nWilson College is situated in Chambersburg, and Mercersburg Academy is\r\nin the borough of Mercersburg, which was also the home of Marshall\r\nCollege, now a part of Franklin and Marshall College, of Lancaster. The\r\nSoldiers’ Orphans’ Industrial School of the state is located at\r\nScotland, and the Pennsylvania State Sanitarium for Tuberculosis, No. 1,\r\nis beautifully located at Mont Alto.\r\n\r\nGreen Castle and Waynesboro are the other towns of importance in old\r\nFranklin County. James Buchanan, President of the United States, and\r\nWilliam Findlay, Governor of Pennsylvania, were both born in\r\nMercersburg.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Commodore Perry Defeats British Squadron\r\n                    on Lake Erie, September 10, 1813\r\n\r\n\r\nForeign nations, who still smiled incredulously at the pretensions of\r\nthe United States in carrying on an ocean warfare with the proud\r\n“Mistress of the Seas,” as England was everywhere acknowledged to be,\r\nwere not prepared to receive, in addition to the splendid victory of the\r\nUnited States frigate Constitution over the Guerriere, fresh and\r\ndecisive proof of the naval supremacy of the youthful Republic, in the\r\nmagnificent triumph achieved by Commodore Oliver H. Perry on the waters\r\nof Lake Erie September 10, 1813.\r\n\r\nIt was here for the first time in the history of the Western World the\r\nflag of a British squadron was struck, humiliatingly, to the Americans.\r\nGreat Britain had already been signally defeated in single naval combats\r\nduring the War of 1812; she was now beaten in squadron; every one of her\r\nships striking their colors to the Stars and Stripes.\r\n\r\nThe unexpected and disgraceful surrender of the Northern Army under\r\nGeneral Hull to the British rendered a superior force on Lake Erie\r\nnecessary for the defense of the American territory bordering on the\r\nlake, as well as for offensive operations in Canada.\r\n\r\nUnder those circumstances, Oliver H. Perry, a brave and capable young\r\nofficer, was designated to the command on Lake Erie. But at this time\r\nthe United States possessed no naval force on the lake; the only vessels\r\nbelonging to the Government had been captured at Detroit.\r\n\r\nCommodore Perry was directed to locate at Presque Isle, where a\r\npeninsula extended a considerable distance into the lake, encircling\r\na harbor, on the borders of which was the port of Erie. He was to\r\nbuild ships, and the only materials at hand were the vast\r\nforests—shipbuilders, sailors, naval stores, guns and ammunition\r\nwere all transported overland by wagons over 400 miles of bad roads\r\nfrom Albany, Buffalo and Philadelphia via Pittsburgh.\r\n\r\nIn spite of those embarrassments, by August 1, 1813, Perry had provided\r\na flotilla, consisting of the ships Lawrence and Niagara, of twenty guns\r\neach, and seven smaller vessels, to wit: One of four guns, one of three,\r\ntwo of two and three of one.\r\n\r\nThe enemy appeared off the harbor while this navy was being built, but\r\nthe shallowness of the water prevented their approach where the\r\nconstruction work could be destroyed.\r\n\r\nAfter Perry succeeded in getting his navy into the deep waters of the\r\nlake, he proceeded to Put-in Bay, near where the British fleet lay under\r\nthe guns of the fort. Here he watched the movements of the enemy and\r\nawaited a chance to offer battle.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of September 10, 1813, the enemy was discovered bearing\r\ndown upon the American force, which immediately prepared to meet them.\r\nPerry had nine vessels with fifty-three guns and two swivels. The\r\nBritish fleet consisted of six vessels, carrying sixty-three guns, four\r\nhowitzers and two swivels.\r\n\r\nPerry advised his officers he proposed to bring the enemy to close\r\nquarters. As soon, therefore, as the approach of the enemy warranted the\r\ndisplay of the signal, every vessel was under sail beating out against\r\nthe wind with the boats ahead towing the others.\r\n\r\nPerry endeavored to beat to the windward of the islands, which\r\ninterposed between them and the two approaching squadrons, hoping thus\r\nto be able to bear down upon the enemy with the wind, but that proved to\r\nbe too light and baffling, and so much time was lost by tacking that\r\nPerry suddenly changed his plans and ordered his ships to run to the\r\nleeward of the islands, when his sailing master replied: “Then we’ll\r\nhave to engage the enemy from the leeward.” “I don’t care,” replied\r\nPerry; “to windward or leeward, they will fight today.”\r\n\r\nPerry formed his line of battle and the two squadrons slowly approached\r\neach other. Realizing they would be in battle by the noon hour, grog and\r\nbread were served in advance, and in a moment every man was at quarters.\r\nPerry made a round of the deck, from gun to gun, carefully examining\r\neach and exchanging cheering words with the men.\r\n\r\nAt fifteen minutes after 11 a bugle was sounded on board the enemy’s\r\nflagship, the Detroit. Loud cheers burst from all their crews, and a\r\ntremendous fire opened upon the Lawrence from the British long guns,\r\nwhich on account of the range of the guns on the Lawrence the fire could\r\nnot be returned for nearly forty minutes.\r\n\r\nThe Lawrence kept her course in gallant and determined style, but was\r\nbadly cut up by the big guns of the Detroit. The enemy’s fire was\r\nclearly directed toward the Lawrence. She was hit in every direction and\r\nnarrowly escaped several explosions.\r\n\r\nPerry realized the seriousness of his situation and made full sail,\r\ndirecting the other vessels to follow, for the purpose of closing with\r\nthe enemy. The terrible fire, however, to which he was exposed soon cut\r\naway every brace and bowline of the Lawrence, and the boat became\r\nunmanageable. The other vessels could not close up, and in this\r\ndisastrous situation the Lawrence continued to sustain the main force of\r\nthe enemy’s fire.\r\n\r\nThroughout the ordeal order prevailed. There was no sign of fear, and as\r\nrapidly as the men at the guns were wounded they were quietly carried\r\nbelow, and others bravely stepped to their places. The dead remained\r\nwhere they fell until after the action.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture the enemy believed the battle won. The Lawrence was\r\nreduced to a mere wreck; her deck was streaming with blood and covered\r\nwith mangled limbs and bodies of the slain; nearly the whole crew were\r\neither killed or wounded; her guns, too, were dismounted, Commodore\r\nPerry and his officers working the very last one capable of firing a\r\nshot.\r\n\r\nAt 2 o’clock Captain Elliott was enabled to bring the Niagara into\r\ncloser action; and Commodore Perry, finding he could get no further use\r\nfrom the Lawrence, suddenly shifted his flag to the Niagara and boarded\r\nher, leaving the gallant Lieutenant Yarnell in command of the Lawrence.\r\n\r\nThe transfer of Perry was made in the face of a terrible fire from the\r\nenemy ships, with the commodore standing erect in the small boat and\r\ndirecting his oarsmen.\r\n\r\nThe entire squadron was soon in action and Perry alongside the British\r\nCommodore Barclay, in the Lady Prevost. Approaching within half pistol\r\nshot, Perry’s fire was so deadly that the enemy’s men were compelled to\r\nrun below.\r\n\r\nThe Caledonia opened a destructive fire upon the British, and she was\r\nclosely followed by the other American vessels, and the enemy was soon\r\nenclosed between the Niagara and the American fleet, and in that\r\nposition the British ships suffered a terrible fire on both quarters.\r\n\r\nThus, after a contest of three hours, a naval victory was achieved by\r\nthe Americans, in which every vessel of the enemy fleet was captured. If\r\nanything could enhance its brilliancy it was the modest and laconic\r\nmanner in which it was announced by the gallant victor—“We have met the\r\nenemy and they are ours!”\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Lord Cornwallis Defeats American Forces\r\n                 on the Brandywine, September 11, 1777\r\n\r\n\r\nThe objective of the British forces, early in the Revolution, was to\r\noccupy Philadelphia, which was then the largest city in the revolting\r\nprovinces. It was the seat of the Continental Congress, and the center\r\nof the colonies. Although commanding easy access to the sea, it was\r\ncapable of being readily protected from the approach of a hostile fleet,\r\nand it lay in the heart of an open, extended country, rich, populous and\r\nso far but little disturbed by war.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia was, in a sense, regarded as the capital of the new-born\r\nNation, and the moral influence resulting from its occupation by\r\nCongress was great, so that it was deemed an important point would be\r\ngained by its conquest. There was much criticism hurled at an army which\r\ncould not penetrate to the headquarters of the infant Nation.\r\n\r\nSir William Howe directed the campaign of 1777, and disposed the troops\r\nunder his command to that purpose. The British fleet under Lord Howe,\r\nbearing a land force of 18,000, left New York in July, 1777, with the\r\nintention of approaching Philadelphia by way of the Delaware River.\r\n\r\nWhen about to enter it, however, the British commander was informed that\r\nthe Americans had placed obstructions in the channel, and he, therefore,\r\nproceeded to the Chesapeake, and on August 25, landed his forces at\r\nTurkey Point.\r\n\r\nWhen the departure of the British fleet from New York was made known to\r\nGeneral Washington, he was uncertain as to its objects, but directed the\r\nconcentration of his army in Bucks County, so as to meet the enemy\r\nshould he attempt to approach Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nWashington soon learned that the fleet was off the Capes of the\r\nChesapeake, and turned his attention in that direction. The very day the\r\nBritish landed the Americans marched to Wilmington with a force of about\r\neleven thousand men.\r\n\r\nWashington made immediate preparations to oppose the enemy. A severe\r\nthough brief encounter occurred September 3 at Iron Hill, Delaware.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th the American Army took its position behind the Red Clay\r\nCreek, where a battle was anticipated. Washington saw that the object\r\nwas to turn his right, cross the Brandywine, and cut off his\r\ncommunication with Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nAfter reconnoitering the enemy, Washington withdrew to Chadd’s Ford, on\r\nthe Brandywine, where he arrived on the 9th of September, and entrenched\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nMaxwell’s Light Infantry occupied the advance posts, and during the\r\nnight of the 10th threw up defenses on the west side at the approaches\r\nto the ford. Here Washington determined to take his stand.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 9th the British Army entered Chester County in two\r\ndivisions, one of which, under General Knyphausen, encamped at New\r\nGarden and Kennet Square, and the other, under Lord Cornwallis, a short\r\ndistance below Hockesson Meeting House.\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of the 10th they united at Kennet Square, whence in\r\nthe evening the forces under Knyphausen advanced toward Welsh’s Tavern,\r\nlater known as the Anvil, and those under Cornwallis remained encamped\r\non the hills north and west of Kennet Square.\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of the 11th the army divided into two columns—one\r\ndivision, under Knyphausen, marched to Chadd’s Ford, by the Philadelphia\r\nroad; the other, under Cornwallis and accompanied by Sir William Howe,\r\ntook a circuitous route and crossed the west branch of the Brandywine at\r\nTrimble’s Ford, and approached the Birmingham Meeting House. The object\r\nof these movements was to hem in the Americans between the two British\r\nforces and thus make them easy prey.\r\n\r\nBoth British columns had moved early and through a dense fog which did\r\nnot lift until a later hour. The column under Knyphausen skirmished with\r\nthe advance parties of the American Army sent forward to harass their\r\nmarch.\r\n\r\nMaxwell’s corps, which occupied the hills west of the Brandywine, was\r\ndriven across the stream after a severe engagement, and joined the main\r\nbody of the American Army, which was already ranged in battle order,\r\nawaiting the attack of the enemy.\r\n\r\nSeveral detachments of the Continental troops subsequently recrossed the\r\ncreek and assailed the British, who were busy throwing up intrenchments\r\nand planting batteries. A footing having thus been gained on the western\r\nbank, General Maxwell returned in force, and a hot conflict ensued, the\r\nAmericans driving the enemy from the ground.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of this action soon drew upon them overwhelming numbers, and\r\nthe Americans were again repulsed.\r\n\r\nLord Cornwallis, with a larger division, under cover of the hills and\r\nforests and aided by the fog, proceeded in a circuitous route a\r\nconsiderable distance unobserved, and reached the hills south of\r\nTrimble’s Ford about the time Knyphausen moved from his position east of\r\nKennet Square.\r\n\r\nGeneral John Sullivan, who commanded the right wing of the American\r\nArmy, had received instructions to guard the fords as far up the stream\r\nas Buffingtons.\r\n\r\nAbout 9 o’clock intelligence was brought that the British left wing was\r\nabout crossing the Brandywine above its forks. Colonel Bland sent word\r\nto General Washington that a large force of the enemy was seen advancing\r\nup the road toward Trimble’s Ford.\r\n\r\nThat was confirmed by a note from Colonel Ross, who was in their rear,\r\nand who advised their strength was 5000. Those reports were in\r\ncontradiction to one that Squire Thomas Cheney gave when he rode up to\r\nGeneral Sullivan and advised him that the main body of the British had\r\ncrossed the Brandywine and was already near at hand, approaching from\r\nthe north.\r\n\r\nThe squire was not believed, and demanded to be led to General\r\nWashington, who doubted his information, but was at length convinced of\r\nits truth and immediately disposed of his troops to meet the emergency.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sullivan attacked the Hessians, who were the advance guard, who\r\nreturned the fire, and soon the action became general. The artillery of\r\nboth sides opened with terrible effect, and while the Americans held\r\ntheir position, the carnage was great.\r\n\r\nThe right wing of the American army under General Debarre gave way\r\nfirst, and the left under General Sullivan, soon followed. The latter\r\ntried to rally his troops, but fled over the fields toward the main army\r\nat Chadd’s Ford.\r\n\r\nSterling’s division in the center remained firm. General Sullivan\r\nattached himself to this division, and with Lafayette he engaged\r\npersonally in the hottest of the battle. Cornwallis used his artillery\r\nwith telling effect. Two of Sullivan’s aides were killed and Lafayette\r\nfell with a wounded leg. The troops fled into the woods, but were again\r\nrallied and after a sharp conflict again retreated.\r\n\r\nWhen Washington learned of the approach of the British, he pushed\r\nforward with Green’s division of Pennsylvanians and Virginians to the\r\nsupport of Sullivan, leaving Wayne at Chadd’s Ford to oppose Knyphausen.\r\nGreen, by a skillful movement, opened his ranks and received the fleeing\r\ntroops and closed them again.\r\n\r\nWayne was on the alert, and the moment Knyphausen moved forward he\r\nopened a heavy artillery fire upon him. Soon as he learned of Sullivan’s\r\ndefeat he retreated.\r\n\r\nThe approach of night ended the bloody conflict, but not soon enough to\r\nprevent the American army from a defeat which was most distressing to\r\nthe American cause at this critical period.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Mob Storms Mifflin County Courthouse\r\n                           September 12, 1791\r\n\r\n\r\nSeptember, 1791, an incident occurred during a term of court in Mifflin\r\nCounty, which has since been known as the Lewistown Riot.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the disturbance centered in the act of Samuel Bryson, then\r\na resident of what is now the borough of Mifflintown, who for several\r\nyears had served as county lieutenant, and while acting in that capacity\r\nrefused to commission two colonels who had been elected by their\r\nregiments, which so incensed the members and their friends that when Mr.\r\nBryson subsequently received the appointment of Associate Justice they\r\nwere indignant and determined he should not act in that capacity.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, September 12, 1791, the Hon. William Brown, Samuel Bryson and\r\nJames Armstrong, Esqs., met in the forenoon in order to open the Court\r\nand proceed to business, but Thomas Beale, Esq., one of the Associate\r\nJudges, not having arrived, the others did not attempt to convene the\r\nCourt until he appeared, which was 3 o’clock, when he was requested to\r\nproceed with them to the court house. Mr. Beale declined to go, but the\r\nothers went into the court room, where the commissions of the Judges\r\nwere read, the Court duly opened, the officers sworn in, and Court\r\nadjourned until 10 o’clock next morning.\r\n\r\nThe following morning, John Clarke, Deputy State’s Attorney, received\r\nthe intelligence that a large body of men was assembled below the Long\r\nNarrows, at David Jordan’s tavern, on the Juniata River shore.\r\n\r\nThey were armed with guns, swords and pistols, with an avowed intention\r\nto proceed to Lewistown and seize Judge Bryson on the bench and drag him\r\nfrom his seat, and march him off before them, and otherwise ill-treat\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThat information was immediately communicated to the Judges, who, acting\r\nupon the suggestion of Mr. Clarke, named Samuel Edminston, Esq., the\r\nProthonotary; Judge Thomas Beale, Mr. Stewart, William Bell, Esq., and\r\nthe Sheriff of Mifflin County, a committee to proceed to the place where\r\nthe mob had assembled and meet with the rioters.\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff was commanded to inquire of them their object and intention,\r\nand if hostile, to order them to disperse and tell them the Court was\r\nalarmed at their proceedings.\r\n\r\nTwo hours after this the Court opened. A fife was heard playing, some\r\nguns were discharged and almost immediately the mob appeared, marching\r\ntoward the court house. Three men on horseback were leading the column.\r\nThe gentlemen who had been sent to counsel with them were being marched\r\nunder a guard in the rear. When the column reached Lewistown all the\r\ncommittee were permitted to go at large except George Wilson, the\r\nSheriff, who was held by an armed guard of four men.\r\n\r\nThe Court ordered Mr. Clarke to go and meet the rioters and remonstrate\r\nagainst their proceedings and warn them of their danger, which order was\r\nobeyed, but his endeavors were in vain.\r\n\r\nThe mob cried out, “March on! March on! Draw your sword on him! Ride\r\nover him!”\r\n\r\nMr. Clarke grabbed the reins of the leader’s horse, who refused to be\r\nheld, and threatened to proceed to the bench and drag Judge Bryson off,\r\ntake him down the Narrows to his own farm and there compel him to sign a\r\nwritten paper that he would never again sit there as a Judge.\r\n\r\nThis leader was a brother of Sheriff George Wilson. The mob cried out,\r\n“March on!” He drew his sword and ordered Clarke to let go the reins.\r\nThe crowd pressed on him and one of them, a nephew of Judge Beale,\r\npressed a pistol to his breast, when Clarke let go of the horse, and the\r\nmob reached the stairs on the outside of the court house. Clarke rushed\r\nahead, and as he mounted the stairs he was met by Judge Armstrong, who\r\nsaid: “Since nothing else will do, let us defend the stairs.”\r\n\r\nAt that point several of the attorneys and citizens, who had been in the\r\ncourt, reached the stairs, where they were met by the rioters, now ably\r\nled by William Wilson, Colonel Walker and Colonel Holt. They cried:\r\n\r\n“March on, damn you; proceed and take him!”\r\n\r\nJudge Armstrong replied, “You damned rascals, come on! We will defend\r\nthe Court ourselves, and before you shall take Judge Bryson you shall\r\nkill me and many others, which seems to be your intention, and which you\r\nmay do.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment Colonel Holt seized Judge Armstrong by the arm with the\r\nintention of dragging him down the stairs, but he freed himself. Holt’s\r\nbrother rushed to him with a sword and urged him to run it through the\r\nJudge. The other leaders drew swords and pistols.\r\n\r\nClarke suggested that they name three of their most respectable persons\r\nto meet with him to settle the dispute. Wilson, the leader, agreed to\r\nthat, but it was with difficulty he was able to get the mob to move from\r\nthe court house.\r\n\r\nMr. Hamilton went with Mr. Clarke to Alexander’s tavern, and soon after\r\ntheir arrival Messrs. Wilson, Walker and Sterritt, of the rioters, came\r\nin. Sterritt acted as their chief counselor.\r\n\r\nProposals were made that they should return home, offer no insult to\r\nJudge Bryson or the Court and send to the Governor a decent petition,\r\nstating their grievances, so that they might be laid before the\r\nLegislature, and that in the meantime Judge Bryson should sit on the\r\nbench of the court.\r\n\r\nThey seemed to be agreed, when mutual honor was pledged, but Sterritt\r\nstated that too great a delay was evident, that injuries had been\r\nreceived which required immediate redress and even objected to the power\r\nof the Governor as to the points proposed.\r\n\r\nAt that juncture Colonel Holt and young Beale rushed in, the latter\r\nheavily armed, and insisted on Wilson joining them, which broke up the\r\nconference. Clarke followed them to the field where the mob was\r\nassembled. Clarke asked Wilson:\r\n\r\n“Your object is that Judge Bryson leave the bench and not sit on it this\r\nCourt?”\r\n\r\nHe and Walker replied, “Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Will you promise to disperse and go home and offer him no insult?”\r\n\r\nThey replied, “Yes.”\r\n\r\nTheir mutual honor was pledged for the performance of the agreement.\r\n\r\nMr. Hamilton then entered the Court, told Judge Bryson the agreement,\r\nwhen he left his seat and retired.\r\n\r\nHardly had Messrs. Hamilton and Clarke reached the court house when the\r\nmob again appeared in martial attitude at the foot of the stairs. Clarke\r\nreminded Wilson of his broken pledge; he acknowledged it, but said the\r\nmob would not have it that way. Clarke told him Judge Bryson had left\r\nthe bench and departed.\r\n\r\nThe next day Colonel McFarland, of the local militia, marched his\r\ncommand to the court house.\r\n\r\nThe Court adjourned until 2 o’clock, and at that hour directed the\r\nSheriff to invite Judge Bryson to march in and sit with them.\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff returned and advised them Judge Beale would not walk in or\r\nsit with Bryson. The Sheriff and Judge Bryson got into an argument, when\r\nthe Sheriff struck and kicked the Judge.\r\n\r\nJudge Armstrong seized the Sheriff, and took his rod from him, the\r\nSheriff was brought before the Court, when he was committed to jail.\r\n\r\nThat night the mob again assembled with the object of rescuing the\r\nSheriff, but before a sufficient number could be raised the Sheriff\r\napologized to the Court and was released on his own recognizance.\r\n\r\nThe mob to the number of 300 assembled at the Narrows the following day,\r\nbut when they learned the Sheriff was no longer in jail and had been\r\nforgiven by the Court they dispersed and went to their homes. The Court\r\nthen adjourned.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Inhuman Murder of Lieutenant Thomas Boyd\r\n                   by Tory Butler, September 13, 1779\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the expedition of Major General John Sullivan against the Six\r\nNations, in August and September, 1779, there occurred one of the most\r\nhorrible Indian massacres recorded in the frontier history of\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\nOn September 12, Lieutenant Thomas Boyd, of the Rifle Corps, a resident\r\nof Northumberland and older brother of the illustrious Captain John Boyd\r\nand brother of Lieutenant William Boyd, who lost his life in the Battle\r\nof Brandywine, was sent with about twenty-four soldiers to reconnoiter\r\nthe town of Genesee. They were guided by a friendly Oneida Indian named\r\nHanjost, a chief of that tribe.\r\n\r\nThis number was too few if a battle was intended and too many for a\r\nsecretive expedition. When the party reached Little Castle, on September\r\n13, they surprised, killed and scalped two Indians.\r\n\r\nThey mistook this place for Genesee, and Lieutenant Boyd intended to\r\nawait there for the advance of the main army, and sent four men to\r\nreport his intentions. This party was fired on, a corporal was killed\r\nand the others fled until the main army was reached.\r\n\r\nBoyd dispatched two more men to learn what had detained the army, when\r\nthey discovered the dead corporal and at the same time the presence of\r\nIndians. They informed Lieutenant Boyd, who immediately assembled his\r\nparty and gave chase, following the British and Tories to within less\r\nthan three miles from the main army.\r\n\r\nThere they encountered a body of four or five hundred which lay in\r\nambush, probably awaiting to surprise the main army, who immediately\r\nsurrounded Boyd’s small party. Their defense against overwhelming odds\r\nwas not less gallant than it was hopeless.\r\n\r\nIn their extremity they posted themselves in a small grove, with a\r\nconsiderable open space around it, and there they continued to fight.\r\nSome of the enemy were so near that the powder from their muskets burned\r\nthe clothing and persons of the Americans, who fought bravely until the\r\noverwhelming superiority of the enemy obliged them to attempt a retreat,\r\nwhich they did, covering their movement with a deadly fire.\r\n\r\nThis small army of British and Indians was under the command of Colonel\r\nJohn Butler and the notorious Indian chieftain, Joseph Brant.\r\n\r\nThe Indians killed and in a most inhuman manner tomahawked and scalped\r\nsix of Boyd’s soldiers, whose bodies were found the next day.\r\n\r\nNine of Boyd’s party escaped and reported the battle as soon as they had\r\nreached the main army.\r\n\r\nAs Lieutenant Boyd, the Indian guide, Chief Hanjost, Timothy Murphy and\r\nsix others had not arrived safe in camp, there was much anxiety for\r\ntheir safety.\r\n\r\nTimothy Murphy was from Northumberland, a personal friend of the Boyd\r\nbrothers and one of the most famous marksmen in the service. It was his\r\nunerring aim which killed General Frazer, the British commander at the\r\nsecond battle of Stillwater, October 7, 1777.\r\n\r\nColonel Adam Hubley, in the journal which he kept during the Sullivan\r\nexpedition, writes of him:\r\n\r\n“This Murphy is a noted marksman and a great soldier, he having killed\r\nand scalped that morning in the Town they were at an Indian, which makes\r\nthe three & thirtieth man of the Enemy he has killed (as is well known\r\nto his officers) in this War.”\r\n\r\nIt is also interesting to note that Murphy made his escape and was the\r\none to report that Lieutenant Boyd and Chief Hanjost were taken\r\nprisoners, and he told in detail of the brave resistance they made.\r\n\r\nThe army made a quick march with the hope of releasing Lieutenant Boyd,\r\nbut on arriving at Genesee Castle, or “Little Beard’s Town,” the capital\r\nsettlement of the Seneca country, Colonel Hubley writes:\r\n\r\n“At this place we found the body of the brave but unfortunate Lieutenant\r\nBoyd and one Rifleman massacred in the most cruel and barbarous manner\r\nthat the human mind can possibly conceive. The savages having put them\r\nto the most excruciating torments possible by first plucking their nails\r\nfrom hands and feet, then spearing, cutting and whipping them and\r\nmangling their bodys, then cutting off the flesh from their shoulders,\r\ntomahawking & severing their heads from their bodys and leaving them a\r\nprey to their dogs.\r\n\r\n“This evening the remains of Lieutenant Boyd and the Rifleman were\r\ninterred with military honors. Mr. Boyd’s former good character as a\r\nbrave soldier and an honest man, and his behaviour in the skirmish of\r\nyesterday (several of the Indians being found dead & some seen carried\r\noff) must indear him to all friends of mankind. May his fate await those\r\nwho have been the cause of his. O! Britain—Behold—and blush!”\r\n\r\nMiner in his “History of Wyoming” says their tongues were pulled out and\r\nflaming pine knots thrust into their flesh and that they were slowly\r\nburned to death in addition to the tortures mentioned by Colonel Hubley.\r\n\r\nMiner says that Lieutenant Boyd was taken before Colonel Butler, the\r\ndetestable Tory, who examined him, while Boyd was held by two savages,\r\nwith a third standing at his back, with a tomahawk raised.\r\n\r\nButler demanded: “How many men has Sullivan?”\r\n\r\nBoyd replied: “I cannot tell you, sir.”\r\n\r\nButler then asked: “How is the army divided and disposed?”\r\n\r\nBoyd replied: “I cannot give you any information, sir.”\r\n\r\nButler then taunted him: “Boyd, life is sweet, you had better answer\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nThe brave lieutenant replied: “Duty forbids, and I would not if life\r\ndepended on the word—but Colonel Butler, I know the issue, my doom is\r\nfixed.”\r\n\r\nThat a prisoner should be taken before Colonel John Butler for\r\nexamination is quite probable.\r\n\r\nSergeant Michael Parker was the rifleman who was murdered with\r\nLieutenant Boyd.\r\n\r\nThe remains of Lieutenant Boyd and Sergeant Parker were found on the\r\noutskirts of the town and were interred with the honors of war. In\r\nAugust, 1842, the remains of these two soldiers were exhumed and removed\r\nto Mount Hope Cemetery, Rochester, N. Y., where they were re-interred.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate Lieutenant Boyd had shared all the hardships of the\r\nill-fated expedition to Quebec under General Arnold, and had experienced\r\nmany campaigns prior to the one in which he made the supreme sacrifice.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Major Grant Meets Defeat at Fort\r\n                      Duquesne, September 14, 1758\r\n\r\n\r\nThe destruction of the Indian town at Kittanning September 8, 1755, was\r\na severe blow to the Indians. The English had never before that time\r\nassailed them in their own towns, and they were led to believe they\r\nwould not venture to approach them. While they desired to retaliate the\r\nblow, they feared another such attack upon their home, when they were\r\nabsent on war parties. Such of them as had belonged to Kittanning and\r\nmade their escape, refused to settle again east of Fort Duquesne.\r\n\r\nNothing was done to annoy the French or check the Indians, until a\r\nchange occurred in the English Ministry, and the master mind of William\r\nPitt assumed the control of the mother country. He seemed to fully\r\nrealize the situation of the English subjects in the colonies and\r\nimmediately determined to send troops in sufficient strength to maintain\r\nher power.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania, as usual, led the way and equipped 2700 men. The other\r\ncolonies contributed large quotas.\r\n\r\nThree expeditions were determined upon, and the most active measures\r\ntaken to bring them to the field. The one in which Pennsylvanians are\r\nmore properly interested was known as the Western expedition. It was\r\nplaced under the command of Major General John Forbes, an officer of\r\ngreat skill, energy and resolution. His army consisted of nearly 9000\r\nmen, embracing British regulars and provincials from Pennsylvania, and\r\nthe Lower Counties, Virginia, Maryland and North Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe troops from the other Governments rendezvoused at Winchester, while\r\nthe Pennsylvanians, under Colonel Henry Bouquet, assembled at Raystown,\r\nnow Bedford.\r\n\r\nGeneral Forbes, with his regulars, marched from Philadelphia to effect a\r\njunction with the provincials at Raystown, but the serious illness of\r\nthe general compelled him to stop at Carlisle, where he remained until\r\nthe middle of September, when he reached Bedford and the provincial\r\ntroops under Colonel George Washington.\r\n\r\nAt the suggestion of Colonel Bouquet and the Pennsylvania officers, a\r\nnew road was cut direct from Raystown to Loyalhanna, a distance of\r\nforty-five miles, where Colonel Bouquet erected Fort Ligonier.\r\n\r\nBefore the arrival of General Forbes at Loyalhanna, Colonel Bouquet had\r\ndispatched Major William Grant, of the Highland Regiment, with\r\nthirty-seven officers and 800 troops, to reconnoitre the fort and\r\nadjacent country. His instructions were to approach not too near the\r\nfort, and in no event to take the risk of an attack.\r\n\r\nGrant camped the first day on the banks of the Nine Mile Run, ten miles\r\nwest of the camp on the Loyalhanna. The second day he proceeded farther,\r\nand on the third reached to within about twelve miles of Fort Duquesne.\r\n\r\nAlthough the French and Indians were constantly watching the movements\r\nof the army, yet Grant succeeded in coming within sight of the fort,\r\nafter marching fifty miles without being discovered.\r\n\r\nThe detachment halted here until 3 o’clock in the afternoon, when the\r\ntroops quietly marched to about two miles from the fort, where they left\r\ntheir baggage under charge of Captain Bullitt, two subalterns and fifty\r\nmen. It was already dark, and later in the night Major Grant appeared\r\nwith his troops at the brow of the fatal hill, which still bears his\r\nname, between the two rivers, about a quarter of a mile from the fort.\r\n\r\nFrom the apparent stillness of the enemy’s camp and not having met with\r\neither French or Indians on the march, Major Grant supposed that the\r\nforces in the fort must be comparatively small, and at once determined\r\nto make an attack.\r\n\r\nTwo officers and fifty men were dispatched to approach the fort and fall\r\nupon the French and Indians that might be lying out, if not in too great\r\nnumber. They saw none, nor were they challenged by the sentinels, and as\r\nthey returned they set fire to a large store house, but the fire was\r\ndiscovered and extinguished.\r\n\r\nAt break of day, Major Lewis was sent with 200 men, principally American\r\nregulars and Virginia volunteers, to take post about half a mile back,\r\nand lie in ambush in the road on which they had left their baggage,\r\nunder the pretension of fears that the enemy would make a bold attempt\r\nto capture it.\r\n\r\nBut Major Grant, who was jealous of Major Lewis, wished to have the\r\nglory of capturing the enemy who had so signally repulsed General\r\nBraddock with his army.\r\n\r\nFour hundred men were posted along the hill facing the fort, to cover\r\nthe retreat of Captain McDonald’s company, who marched with drums\r\nbeating toward the enemy, in order to draw a party out of the fort, as\r\nMajor Grant believed there were not more than 200 men, including\r\nIndians, in the fortress.\r\n\r\nThe garrison was aroused from its slumber by the music of the invaders,\r\nand French and Indians sallied out in great numbers to the attack. Their\r\nwhole force was divided into three divisions. The first two were sent\r\ndirectly under cover of the banks of the river to surround the main body\r\nunder Major Grant. The remaining division was delayed while the others\r\nmaneuvred, and then displayed themselves before the fort, as if\r\nexhibiting their whole strength.\r\n\r\nThe attack then commenced, and Captain McDonald was immediately obliged\r\nto fall back upon the main body and was a moment later killed.\r\n\r\nMajor Grant received and returned a most destructive fire. At this\r\nmoment he suddenly found himself flanked on all sides by the detachments\r\nfrom the banks of the river. The struggle became desperate.\r\n\r\nThe provincials put up a good defense while concealing themselves behind\r\ntrees, but the Highlanders who stood exposed to the enemy’s fire without\r\ncover, fell in great numbers, and at last gave way and fled. Soon the\r\nprovincials, having lost all their support, and being overpowered by\r\nnumbers, were compelled to follow.\r\n\r\nMajor Grant retreated to the baggage where Captain Bullitt was posted,\r\nwhere he again endeavored to rally his flying soldiers. His earnest\r\nappeals for support were unavailing, as the French and Indians were too\r\nclose at their heels.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the enemy came up Captain Bullitt attacked them with great\r\nfury for awhile, but not being supported, and most of his men having\r\nbeen killed, he was obliged to give way.\r\n\r\nThe resistance shown by Captain Bullitt’s detail afforded many of the\r\nretreating and a few of the wounded to escape. Major Grant and Captain\r\nBullitt were the last to leave the field, but when they separated Major\r\nGrant was taken prisoner.\r\n\r\nIn this conflict, which took place September 14, 1758, 270 men were\r\nkilled, forty-two wounded and several taken prisoners.\r\n\r\n“It was,” says Colonel Washington, in a letter to the Governor of\r\nVirginia, “a very ill-concerted, or a very ill-executed plan, perhaps\r\nboth; but it seems to be generally acknowledged that Major Grant\r\nexceeded his orders and that no disposition was made for engaging.”\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Madame Montour Resents Murder of Her\r\n                      Brother, September 15, 1711\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the provincial history of Pennsylvania the name of the Montours\r\nstands out among the many Indians of note, and the intimate story of\r\nthis large family presents many interesting and contradictory\r\ncharacteristics.\r\n\r\nThe first one of this family, which has given us its name for a county,\r\ntown, river, creek and mountain range, was the celebrated Madame\r\nMontour.\r\n\r\nThere has always been a question of doubt as to her birth. She claimed\r\nto be a half-breed French-Indian, her father being a Governor of Canada.\r\nWhether this is true or not, about 1665 a French nobleman named Montour\r\nsettled in Canada, where by an Indian woman, probably a Huron, he became\r\nthe father of a son and two daughters. This son of Montour grew up among\r\nthose Indians, who were at that time in alliance with the French.\r\n\r\nIn 1685, while in the French service, he was wounded in a fight with two\r\nMohawk warriors on Lake Champlain. Subsequently he deserted the French\r\ncause and again lived among the Indians. In 1709 he was killed while\r\ninducing twelve of the Western tribes to support the English.\r\n\r\nOne of his sisters became a noted interpreter and friend of the English,\r\nand was known as Madame Montour; the other sister married a Miami Indian\r\nand her history is lost.\r\n\r\nMadame Montour was born previous to the year 1684. When about ten years\r\nold she was captured by some Iroquois warriors and adopted, probably by\r\nthe Seneca tribe, for at maturity she married a Seneca named Roland\r\nMontour, by whom she had five children: Andrew, Henry, Robert, Lewis and\r\nMargaret.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Roland, Madame Montour married the noted Oneida\r\nchief, Carondowanen, or “Big Tree,” who later took the name Robert\r\nHunter in honor of the royal governor of the province of New York.\r\n\r\nAbout 1729 Robert Hunter was killed in battle with the Catawba, against\r\nwhom he was waging war.\r\n\r\nMadame Montour first appeared as an official interpreter at the\r\nconference at Albany, September 15, 1711. At this conference the wanton\r\nmurder of her brother, Andrew, by Vaudreuil, was bitterly resented by\r\nMadame Montour, and she employed her great influence with telling effect\r\nagainst the French, who tried to induce her to remove to Canada, but she\r\nremained loyal to the English and was put in a position of great power\r\nwith lucrative return.\r\n\r\nMadame Montour was the interpreter in Philadelphia in 1727 at a\r\nconference between Deputy Governor Patrick Gordon and the Provincial\r\nCouncil on the one hand and the Six Nations, Conestoga, Ganawese and\r\nSusquehanna Indians on the other.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed that Madame Montour was a lady in manner and education,\r\nwas very attractive in mind and body, and that she was entertained by\r\nladies of the best society on her trips to Philadelphia; but as her\r\nsister married an Indian and she was twice wedded to an Indian warrior,\r\nit is probable her education and refinement were not so marked as is\r\nclaimed.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, from the testimony of those who saw and knew her, but\r\ncontrary to the statement of Lord Cornbury, who knew her brother, it\r\nseems almost certain that she was a French-Canadian without any\r\nadmixture of Indian blood, and that for some unaccountable reason she\r\npreferred the life and dress of her adopted people.\r\n\r\nMadame Montour was always uniformly friendly toward the proprietary\r\nGovernment, and such was the loyalty of her family that at least two of\r\nher sons, Henry and Andrew, received large grants of “donation land”\r\nfrom the Government. That of Henry lay upon the Chillisquaque Creek, in\r\nNorthumberland County, and that of Andrew, on the Loyalsock, where\r\nMontoursville, in Lycoming County, is now situated.\r\n\r\nMadame Montour resided at the village of Ostonwackin[7] in 1734. This\r\nwas some times known as Frenchtown. When Conrad Weiser visited there in\r\n1737, on his way to Onondaga, he wrote of Madame Montour, as “a French\r\nwoman by birth, of a good family, but now in mode of life a complete\r\nIndian.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  Village at mouth of Loyalsock Creek, present site of Montoursville,\r\n  Lycoming County, Pa.\r\n\r\nWhen she attended the great treaty at Lancaster in 1744 she was\r\naccompanied by two of her daughters, and at that time related to Witham\r\nMarshe the story of her life. He represented her as genteel and of\r\npolite address and as having been attractive in her prime.\r\n\r\nWhen Count Zinzendorf, the Moravian missionary, visited Shamokin (now\r\nSunbury) in 1742, he was welcomed by Madame Montour and her son Andrew.\r\nShe had moved to that place from Ostonwackin.\r\n\r\nUpon learning that the Count came to preach the gospel, the truths of\r\nwhich she had almost forgotten, she burst into tears. It was learned\r\nthat she believed that Bethlehem, the birthplace of Christ, was situated\r\nin France, and that it was the English who crucified him—a silly\r\nperversion of the truth that originated with French religious teachers.\r\n\r\nIt is thought she died at the home of her son, Andrew, in 1752.\r\n\r\nOf the children of Madame Montour, Andrew became the most prominent and\r\nindeed he was one of the strong men during a long period of stirring\r\ntimes in the province. His Indian name was Sattelihu, he was a son by\r\nher first husband.\r\n\r\nAndrew became an interpreter at an early age and served the Proprietary\r\nGovernment faithfully and well; he also was loved by his Indian\r\nbrethren, for he zealously guarded their interests.\r\n\r\nIn 1745 he accompanied Conrad Weiser and Shikellamy, the vicegerent of\r\nthe Six Nations on the Susquehanna, on a mission to Onondaga, the\r\nFederal capital of the confederation.\r\n\r\nHe was sent on important missions to Maryland and other places and in\r\n1753 the French authorities set a price of $500 on his head. In 1755 he\r\nwas living ten miles northwest from Carlisle, on land which had been\r\ngranted to him for his services.\r\n\r\nDuring the French and Indian War he was captain of a company of Indians\r\nin the English service, and later rose to the rank of major.\r\n\r\nIn 1762 he was King’s interpreter to the United Nations, and he served\r\nas interpreter for the Delaware Indians at Fort Augusta, at the time\r\nConrad Weiser held a conference for the purpose of bringing about peace\r\nbetween the Southern Confederation and the Six Nations.\r\n\r\nOctober 29, 1768, the Proprietary Government surveyed and granted to\r\nAndrew Montour 880 acres of land at the mouth of the Loyalsock, where\r\nthe borough of Montoursville now is. With this and other grants he was\r\nconsidered a man of great wealth.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Matthew Carey, Editor and Influential\r\n                   Writer of Philadelphia, Died There\r\n                           September 16, 1839\r\n\r\n\r\nMatthew Carey came to Philadelphia in November 1784, and spent the\r\nremainder of his eventful life there, dying September 16, 1839. He was\r\nborn in Dublin, Ireland, January 28, 1760, where he spent his early\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nHe learned the business of printer and bookseller, and at the age of\r\nseventeen he wrote and published a pamphlet on duelling. This was soon\r\nfollowed by an address to Roman Catholics in Ireland on their oppression\r\nby the penal code. This was so seditious and inflammatory that he was\r\ncompelled to fly to Paris, but returned in the course of a year, and was\r\nsoon after prosecuted for printing a libel.\r\n\r\nIn 1783, he edited the Freeman’s Journal and established the Volunteer’s\r\nJournal.\r\n\r\nIn 1784, he printed a libel on the Lord Mayor of Dublin, and was\r\nimprisoned during the session of Parliament. He escaped on board a ship\r\nin woman’s dress, and arrived in Philadelphia, November 15, 1784.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lafayette, then on a visit to the United States, heard his\r\nstory, and not only procured influence for him, but advanced $400 to\r\nCarey, who immediately started the Pennsylvania Herald, the first number\r\nof which publication appeared January 25, 1785.\r\n\r\nThe young printer, publisher, and editor attracted immediate attention\r\nand patronage by giving the best reports of the Assembly yet published.\r\nThe Herald was in fact the first newspaper in America which gave full\r\nand accurate reports of legislative proceedings.\r\n\r\nMatthew Carey was most aggressive with his pen, and burning with hate to\r\nEngland, he at once became one of the most notable of the foreign-born\r\neditors in America.\r\n\r\nBut the spirited temper of the enterprising young Irishman aroused\r\ncollisions, one of which with Colonel Oswald, had serious result.\r\nEleazer Oswald had been a colonel in the Continental army during the\r\nwar, in which he appears to have served with credit; he was a kinsman of\r\nElizabeth Holt, wife of John Holt, and aided her in conducting the\r\nJournal after the death of her husband, in 1785 and 1786. They sold the\r\nJournal in 1787 to Thomas Greenleaf.\r\n\r\nOswald had an “unpleasantness” with Francis Child, of the New York\r\nAdvertiser, and then succeeded in getting himself into a political\r\ndispute with Matthew Carey.\r\n\r\nThis latter quarrel terminated in a duel, in which Carey was shot above\r\nthe knee, a wound that confined him to the house for nearly sixteen\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nDuring the interval, Carey seems to have been able to continue his\r\neditorial labors, and, in 1786, with several partners, he started the\r\nColumbian Magazine, but withdrew from this enterprise the following\r\nDecember, and founded the American Museum, a monthly eclectic magazine,\r\nwhich he edited with marked ability for six years.\r\n\r\nAfter abandoning the Museum Carey entered into business as a bookseller\r\nand publisher, and among other works issued a quarto edition of the\r\nBible, called the standing edition—as it was kept in type.\r\n\r\nHe took an active part in charitable enterprises, and every fortnight\r\ndispensed food and other necessaries of life to hundreds of poor widows.\r\nHe was particularly active in works of benevolence during the prevalence\r\nof yellow fever in Philadelphia in 1793, and wrote and published a\r\nhistory of that epidemic.\r\n\r\nIn 1793 Carey founded the Hibernian Society and undertook with Hugh\r\nGaine a system of annual book fairs, resembling the present trade sales.\r\n\r\nHe was an associate of Bishop William White and others in the formation\r\nof the first American Sunday School Society.\r\n\r\nWhile the War of 1812–14 was kindling he wrote much on political\r\nsubjects, and in 1814 the Olive Branch appeared, in which he attempted\r\nto harmonize the contending parties in the United States. It passed\r\nthrough ten editions.\r\n\r\nIn 1818 he published “Vindicia Hibernicæ,” which was a refutation of\r\ncharges made against the Catholics of Ireland of butchering Protestants\r\nin the insurrection of 1640.\r\n\r\nIn 1820 he published “The New Olive Branch,” which was in favor of\r\nprotection to American industry; and two years later his “Essays on\r\nPolitical Economy,” were also published in favor of protection. These\r\npublications were widely circulated.\r\n\r\nIn 1830, under the title of “Miscellaneous Essays,” Carey republished\r\nselections from his writings. There are fifty-eight papers, essays, and\r\nlonger compositions, and two hundred pieces collected under the heading\r\nof “Light Reading.”\r\n\r\nCarey also advocated the system of internal improvements which led to\r\nthe construction of the great canal system in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nHe was active in promoting education, and in forming associations for\r\nthe relief of those unable to help themselves.\r\n\r\nAs Matthew Carey advanced in years, he acquired a fair amount of wealth,\r\nand in consequence of ease and comfortable environment, he became a\r\nprolific writer, but always on subjects which were solid. He gave no\r\ntime to the elegancies of literature or fiction.\r\n\r\nIn this field of literature he was succeeded by his son Henry Charles\r\nCarey, who became well known for his robust works on political economy.\r\n\r\nIn 1833–34 Matthew Carey contributed his autobiography to the New\r\nEngland Magazine.\r\n\r\nHe acquired an enviable social position as well as one of wealth. He\r\ndied much lamented at his home in Philadelphia, September 16, 1839.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              First Constitution of United States Adopted\r\n                   in Philadelphia September 17, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States, as is well known, was framed\r\nduring the summer of 1787, by a convention of Delegates from twelve\r\nStates. The convention sat in the old State House at Philadelphia, and\r\nafter a stormy session of four months ended its labors on September 17,\r\n1787.\r\n\r\nIn the preliminary movement to form a nation, only five of the thirteen\r\ncolonies were represented. Delegates from New York, New Jersey,\r\nPennsylvania, Delaware and Virginia, met at Annapolis, Md., September\r\n11, 1786, and after much discussion and consideration, they recommended\r\nthat a convention be called to meet in Philadelphia on the second Monday\r\nof May, 1787.\r\n\r\nWhen that day arrived the only delegates to appear at the State House\r\nwere those of Pennsylvania and Virginia. At the end of two weeks no\r\nothers had arrived except those from Delaware and New Jersey. This fact\r\nindicates how little they appreciated the importance of the event.\r\n\r\nFinally, twelve States were represented; the largest delegation was from\r\nPennsylvania, and consisted of Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Mifflin, Robert\r\nMorris, George Clymer, Thomas Fitzsimmons, Jared Ingersoll, James Wilson\r\nand Gouverneur Morris. General George Washington was elected president,\r\nand William Jackson, secretary. The convention sat with closed doors.\r\n\r\nFormer Governor Pennypacker, in his excellent “Pennsylvania—The\r\nKeystone,” says “Washington presided and the aged Franklin participated,\r\nbut the most learned lawyer among them was James Wilson, and, perhaps,\r\nmore than any other member, he affected the results reached.”\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the day that the convention finished its labors, the\r\nConstitution was duly signed by thirty-nine of the members. Some\r\nresolutions and a letter from Washington were ordered to be sent to\r\nCongress and to be by it transmitted to the States.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution was adopted September 17, 1787, and by this action of\r\nthe convention a new Nation was born in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nWhile these things were taking place in a lower room of the State House,\r\nthe Legislature of Pennsylvania was in session in a room above, and the\r\nConstitution was read to it on the morning of September 18.\r\n\r\nCopies were then given to the press, and the next day the people of\r\nPhiladelphia were reading the new plan in the “Packet,” the “Journal”\r\nand the “Gazetteer.” For a few days nothing but praise was heard, but\r\nbefore a week was gone, it was attacked.\r\n\r\nThe principal supporters of the plan of the Federal Convention were\r\nformer officers of the Revolution, many of whom had served throughout\r\nthe entire struggle for independence, while not one prominent soldier of\r\nthat war was included among the twenty-three Anti-Federalists who\r\nconsistently voted against ratification.\r\n\r\nAll was not satisfactory, and there was much trouble about the adoption\r\nof the Constitution, which did not go into effect until ratified by nine\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nPatrick Henry, of Virginia, and Elbridge Gerry, of Massachusetts,\r\nopposed it violently. It also had many opponents in Pennsylvania.\r\nParticularly was this true among the partisans of the State Government.\r\n\r\nA draft of the instrument was reported to the Assembly, when a motion\r\nwas made to authorize the calling of a State convention to deliberate\r\nupon its adoption.\r\n\r\nThis body met November 21, and was organized by the choice of Frederick\r\nA. Muhlenberg as president, and James Campbell, as secretary. On\r\nDecember 12, following, the final adoption of the draft of the\r\nConstitution was carried by a vote of 46 to 23 against it.\r\n\r\nThe following day the members of the convention and of the Supreme\r\nExecutive Council, with officers of the State and the City of\r\nPhiladelphia and others, went in procession from the State House to the\r\nold court house, where the ratification of the instrument was solemnly\r\nproclaimed. Twelve cannon were fired and the bells were rung.\r\n\r\nThe convention returned to the State House, where two copies of the\r\nratification of the Constitution were signed. According to Hamilton, a\r\nmotion was made that all members should sign it as an acquiescence to\r\nthe principle that the majority should govern, which was strenuously\r\nobjected to by the opponents of this instrument.\r\n\r\nDelaware ratified the Constitution December 7, 1787, making Pennsylvania\r\nthe second State to ratify. That is the reason that today in all\r\nnational processions these States are given the lead.\r\n\r\nState after State approved the Constitution, and in several of them\r\nprocessions had taken place to celebrate, but in Pennsylvania there had\r\nbeen no celebration of this kind; but it was decided, however, that as\r\nsoon as the ninth State acceded to it, measures should be taken for\r\npublic rejoicing.\r\n\r\nFollowing Delaware and Pennsylvania came New Jersey, which adopted the\r\nConstitution December 18; Georgia, January 2, 1788; Connecticut, January\r\n9; Massachusetts, February 6; Maryland, April 28; South Carolina, May\r\n23.\r\n\r\nOn June 21, when New Hampshire, the ninth State, ratified it, it was\r\ndetermined by the citizens of Philadelphia to celebrate the formation of\r\nthe new Union on the evening of the Fourth of July. By that time\r\nVirginia had also ratified the Constitution by vote of June 26.\r\n\r\nThis pageant was as imposing as it was possible for the authorities and\r\nthe people of Pennsylvania in their enthusiasm to make it, and not only\r\nin the metropolis but in every town in the State was the occasion one of\r\npatriotism and splendor.\r\n\r\nNew York ratified the Constitution July 26, 1788; North Carolina,\r\nNovember 21, 1789, and the last one of the thirteen original States to\r\nratify was Rhode Island, which did not accomplish it until May 29, 1790.\r\n\r\nThe adoption of the Constitution rendered the institution of measures\r\nnecessary for the election of members of Congress and electors of\r\nPresident and Vice President of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Anti-Federalists immediately got busy and endeavored to effect a\r\nplan to revise the new Constitution, but were defeated in their\r\npurposes. The actions of this body in Pennsylvania in their convention\r\nin Harrisburg, September, 1788, were denounced by the people.\r\n\r\nA new convention was called to meet in Lancaster, which selected\r\ncandidates for Congress and electors for President.\r\n\r\nThe election of members of Congress took place in November, and in the\r\nState six of the nominees of the Federal ticket were elected, and two,\r\nDavid Muhlenberg, of Montgomery, and Daniel Hiester, of Berks, who,\r\nalthough Federalists, had, with two others of the same politics, been\r\nplaced as a matter of policy with the opposition ticket.\r\n\r\nThe centennial of the adoption of the Federal Constitution was fittingly\r\ncelebrated in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nOn September 15, 1887, there was a large civic and industrial\r\nprocession, a military display on the 16th, and fine Memorial Day\r\nceremonies in Independence Square on the 17th.\r\n\r\nThe occasion was celebrated with great credit to Philadelphia,\r\nPennsylvania and the Nation, as it illustrated the dignity and grandeur\r\nof the Republic.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Labor Riots Follow Civil War; Jay Cooke\r\n                   Company Failed September 18, 1873\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing the suggestion of Governor John White Geary, the Legislature\r\non June 2, 1871, adopted a resolution to submit the question of calling\r\na convention to amend the Constitution to a vote of the people. The\r\ndelegates were elected October, 1872, and assembled in the Capitol\r\nNovember 12, 1872.\r\n\r\nHon. William M. Meredith was elected president and served until his\r\ndeath, August 17, 1873, when Hon. John H. Walker, of Erie County, was\r\nchosen to fill the vacancy. The convention adjourned November 27 to meet\r\nin Philadelphia on January 7, 1873.\r\n\r\nA new Constitution was drafted and adopted, after which it was submitted\r\nto the people on December 16, 1873, and approved by a vote of 263,560 to\r\n109,198.\r\n\r\nThis new Constitution contained several important changes: An increase\r\nin the number of Senators and Representatives in the General Assembly;\r\nbiennial sessions of the Legislature; the election by the people of\r\nsundry officers heretofore appointed; minority representation;\r\nmodification of the pardoning power; the term of the Governor made for\r\nfour years, and not eligible to the office for the succeeding term; the\r\noffice of Lieutenant-Governor created; changes in tenure and mode of\r\nelecting Judges of the courts. The new Constitution became effective\r\nJanuary 1, 1874.\r\n\r\nThe good times which followed the Civil War were in a few years followed\r\nby a financial depression that extended over the whole country and\r\nreduced innumerable financial establishments to ruin.\r\n\r\nThese financial troubles began in Philadelphia with the failure of the\r\nbanking house of Jay Cooke & Co., September 18, 1873. Mr. Cooke’s bank\r\nhad given such help to the United States Government during the period of\r\nthe war that he was frequently called the “Financier of the Rebellion.”\r\n\r\nWhen this banking institution collapsed there followed a run on other\r\nbanks, the effects of which soon spread throughout the United States.\r\n\r\nThe excellent “Pennsylvania Colonial and Federal,” by Howard M. Jenkins,\r\nsays: “The condition of the times was rendered more deplorable by a\r\nseries of labor difficulties, extending from 1874–1877. In 1874, there\r\nwas a conflict in Westmoreland County between Italian and resident\r\nminers, in which four of the Italians were killed. The same year there\r\nwas a railroad strike at Susquehanna on the New York and Erie Railroad.\r\nA number of trains were seized by the mob, and order was not restored\r\nuntil after the Governor had sent the State militia into that region. In\r\nJanuary, 1875, the miners of the Lehigh and Schuylkill regions began a\r\nstrike, which lasted six months. There was but little violence; yet the\r\nGovernor found it necessary to order the militia to the scene of the\r\ndisturbance.”\r\n\r\nIn 1877, the spirit of lawlessness increased, culminating in a series of\r\ndestructive riots in different parts of the State. The cause of all this\r\ntrouble was the railroad strike, which began on July 16, and soon became\r\ngeneral throughout the United States.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of July, a circular was issued from the offices of the\r\nBaltimore and Ohio Railroad, announcing a reduction of 10 per cent from\r\nthe wages which the men were then receiving. A new schedule of wages was\r\nannounced, to take effect on July 16. At all points along the railroad,\r\nthere were demonstrations against this reduction. A strike was ordered,\r\nand before midnight of the 16th the immense property of the Baltimore\r\nand Ohio was in the hands of the rioters.\r\n\r\nOn July 19 the employes of the Pennsylvania Railroad at Pittsburgh\r\ninaugurated a strike, and stopped the passage of all freight trains east\r\nand west. By the evening of the 20th, a large number of freight trains\r\nwere tied up in the city. The striking workmen resisted all efforts of\r\nthe railroad officials to remove these trains, and threatened acts of\r\nviolence. At this time Governor John F. Hartranft was on a trip across\r\nthe continent, but upon the call of the Sheriff the Adjutant General\r\nordered the Sixteenth Division of the National Guard to assist in\r\nrestoring order.\r\n\r\nAdjutant General James W. Latta arrived at Pittsburgh on July 21, to\r\ntake personal charge of all the troops ordered out. The First Division\r\nof the National Guard was also called into service, and on the forenoon\r\nof the 21st, the troops took position upon the hill overlooking the\r\ntracks at Twenty-eighth Street.\r\n\r\nAt 2 o’clock in the afternoon the troops from Philadelphia arrived, and\r\nthey at once proceeded to open the road. As they approached\r\nTwenty-eighth Street, the crowds pressed in upon them and stones were\r\nthrown by the mob.\r\n\r\nThere was considerable firing on both sides, and in the melee twenty\r\nsoldiers were wounded. In the evening the soldiers withdrew to the\r\nroundhouse and adjacent buildings. At midnight the rioters determined to\r\ndrive them out by burning the freight cars in the vicinity. The result\r\nwas a great conflagration, in which vast quantities of freight were\r\nconsumed and all the rolling stock and buildings of the Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad at Pittsburgh were destroyed.\r\n\r\nHastening from his trip, Governor Hartranft reached Pittsburgh on July\r\n24. After a consultation with the leading citizens he went to\r\nPhiladelphia to confer with Generals Hancock and Schofield, of the\r\nUnited States Army.\r\n\r\nArrangements were made to forward a detachment of the regular army to\r\nPittsburgh, there to join the State troops which the Governor collected\r\non the way.\r\n\r\nA large force was soon gathered at the scene of the disturbance, and,\r\nwith Governor Hartranft in personal command, order was restored in a few\r\ndays and railroad communications were opened with all parts of the\r\ncountry. In the meantime there were serious riots in other parts of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThe lawless spirit in Philadelphia and Harrisburg was quelled by the\r\nprompt action of the officials, but in Reading the work of destruction\r\nwas almost equal to that in Pittsburgh. The railroad bridge over the\r\nSchuylkill was burned, and the mob virtually controlled the city.\r\n\r\nAs the authorities of Berks County were unable to suppress the riot,\r\nGeneral Reeder was sent there with a division of the National Guard. On\r\nthe evening of July 23 there was a severe street fight between the mob\r\nand the soldiers, in which some of the latter were wounded, while eleven\r\nof the crowd were killed. The next day a detachment of the United States\r\ntroops arrived and the railroad was opened to traffic.\r\n\r\nThe contagion of lawlessness affected the miners of Luzerne County, and\r\non July 25 they began a general strike. All railroad traffic was\r\nsuspended in that region, and at Scranton the rioters attempted to drive\r\nthe workmen from the shops. The Sheriff with a number of aides dispersed\r\nthe crowd, but he was seriously wounded and three of the mob were\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\nAs the conditions became more threatening, it was necessary to forward a\r\ndivision of the National Guard to the coal regions. Early in August all\r\ndisorder was suppressed, and in a few weeks all the railroads in the\r\nState were running on schedule time.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Indians Defrauded by Deceptive Walking\r\n                    Land Measure, September 19, 1737\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the time of William Penn’s arrival, in 1682, while he was a lowly\r\nChristian himself, he had followers who did not have the same fear of\r\nGod in their hearts, and who did not hesitate to excite the cupidity of\r\nthe unsophisticated children of the forest, and by any and all means\r\ntake advantage of them.\r\n\r\nWilliam Penn formed many treaties with the Indians and concluded many\r\npurchases, no one of which was well and accurately defined as to its\r\nactual boundary.\r\n\r\nPenn and his agents were ignorant of the topography of the wilderness in\r\nthe interior of “Penn’s Woods,” and in their earlier purchases had been\r\nin the habit of defining the boundaries of land by well-known streams or\r\nhighlands, or well-known natural objects.\r\n\r\nThey often indicated their extension into the unknown region by such\r\nvague terms as: “To run two days’ journey with a horse up into the\r\ncountry as the river doth go,” or “Northeasterly back into the woods to\r\nmake up two full days’ journey,” or “far as a man can go in two days\r\nfrom said station,” etc.\r\n\r\nThe first purchase of land from the Indians above the Neshaminy, in\r\nBucks County, made by William Markham, the agent of William Penn, was in\r\n1682. This purchase was to be bounded by the River Delaware on the\r\nnortheast, and the Neshaminy on the northwest, and was to extend as far\r\nback as a man could walk in three days.\r\n\r\nIt is stated that Penn and the Indians began to walk out this land,\r\ncommencing at the mouth of the Neshaminy, and walking up the Delaware;\r\nin one day and a half they got to a spruce tree, near Baker’s Creek,\r\nwhen Penn concluded this would be as much land as he would want at\r\npresent. A line was drawn and marked from the spruce tree to the\r\nNeshaminy.\r\n\r\nThis was the only boundary which was ever settled by Penn in person, and\r\nPenn wrote of this trip, saying that they frequently halted to converse,\r\nsmoke and eat.\r\n\r\nLines measured in that manner would often have extended far beyond the\r\nexpectations of the contracting parties, so more definite terms were\r\nsoon employed to define limits of land grants. But about 1718 the\r\nsettlers, maintaining the authority of the original lines, pushed their\r\nimprovements beyond the designated lines, much to the dissatisfaction of\r\nthe Indians.\r\n\r\nThat act nearly precipitated war, had not wiser counsels prevailed, but\r\nencroachments continued until a general meeting of the Iroquois was held\r\nand their chiefs determined to put an end to the bickerings, and sent\r\ntheir chief sachems to Philadelphia. There they renewed old treaties, by\r\nthe signatures of twenty-three of their chiefs, and deed to Penn’s heirs\r\n“all the said river Susquehanna, with lands lying on both sides thereof,\r\nto extend eastward as far as the heads of the branch or springs which\r\nrun into the said Susquehanna, and all lands lying on the west side of\r\nthe said river, northward, up the same to the hills or mountains.”\r\n\r\nThat did not even stop the unscrupulous land seeker and much additional\r\nland was taken from the natives, which in consequence provoked trouble.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of William Penn a copy of one of those walk-deeds was\r\nfound by Thomas and John Penn, who, at a council in 1733, fifty years\r\nafter it had been executed, presented it to the Indians and received\r\nfrom them an acknowledgment of its validity, and under that an\r\narrangement was made for a walk of one day and a half to settle the\r\nboundaries.\r\n\r\nThe Penns, although strict Quakers, did not shrink from using means\r\nabout the honesty of which there could be some question, and they\r\nadvertised far and wide for the fastest walkers, offering five hundred\r\nacres of land and five pounds in money to the man who would walk the\r\ngreatest distance in the allotted time.\r\n\r\nEvery facility was furnished them, a direct line was run, underbrush was\r\ncleared away, refreshments were placed at convenient distances, all\r\narranged so that there might be little or no delay. Indeed, the\r\npreparations for a modern marathon race could hardly be more carefully\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nThe persons selected by the Governor were Edward Marshall, James Yeates\r\nand Solomon Jennings. One of the Indians was called Combush, another\r\nNeepaheilomon, also known as Joe Tuneam, and his brother-in-law, Tom.\r\n\r\nThe time appointed for the walk was the morning of September 19, 1737,\r\nwhen the days and nights were equal. The walk was to commence at a\r\nchestnut tree just above the present site of Wrightstown Meeting House,\r\nunder the supervision of Timothy Smith, sheriff of Bucks County, and\r\nBenjamin Eastburn, surveyor general.\r\n\r\nMarshall was a noted hunter, chain carrier, etc.; Yeates was a tall,\r\nslim fellow, very agile and fleet of foot; Jennings was remarkable for\r\nhis strength, but was of very stout build.\r\n\r\nA great crowd of spectators gathered at the starting point. The walkers\r\nwere accompanied by a number of persons who carried refreshments and\r\notherwise encouraged the walkers to greater efforts.\r\n\r\nThey walked moderately at first, but soon quickened their pace, so that\r\nthe Indians frequently called to them to walk and not to run. Those\r\nremonstrances produced no effect, and most of the Indians left them in\r\nanger, saying they were being cheated. A number of persons had collected\r\nabout twenty miles from the starting point to see them pass.\r\n\r\nFirst came Yeates, stepping as lightly as a feather. After him, but yet\r\nout of sight came Jennings, with a strong steady step, then far behind\r\nhim came Marshall, apparently careless, swinging a hatchet and eating a\r\nbiscuit. Bets ran in favor of Yeates.\r\n\r\nIn two and a half hours they arrived at Red Hill, in Bedminister, but\r\nthe pace by this time was too hot for Jennings and two of the Indians\r\nand they gave up the contest. The other Indian, Combush, continued with\r\nMarshall and Yeates, and when they arrived at the fork of the road, near\r\nwhat is now Bethlehem, Combush laid down to rest a moment, but on\r\nattempting to rise was unable to proceed farther.\r\n\r\nMarshall and Yeates continued alone and by sunset arrived on the north\r\nof Blue Mountain. At sunrise the next morning they started again, but\r\nwhen crossing a stream at the foot of the mountain near Lehigh Water\r\nGap, Yeates became faint and fell. Marshall turned back and supported\r\nhim until some of the attendants came up, and then continued to walk on\r\nby himself. At noon, the hour when the walk was to terminate, he had\r\nreached a spur on the Second or Broad Mountain, estimated to be\r\neighty-six miles from the starting point.\r\n\r\nHaving thus reached the fartherest possible point to the northwestward,\r\na line was drawn from the end of the “walk” to the Delaware River.\r\n\r\nNot being described in the deed of purchase, the agent of the\r\nProprietaries, instead of running by the nearest course to the river,\r\nran northeastward across the country about sixty-six miles, so as to\r\nstrike the Delaware near the mouth of the Lackawaxen, thus extending far\r\nup the river, taking in all the Minisink territory, and many thousand\r\nacres more than they should have included had the line been run by the\r\ndirect course to the Delaware.\r\n\r\nThis walk gained for the Penn’s territory which now constitutes the\r\nnorthern part of Bucks, virtually the whole of Northampton and a portion\r\nof Pike, Carbon and Monroe counties.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                British Surprise and Slaughter Americans\r\n                      at Paoli, September 20, 1777\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing the defeat of the Continental Army at Brandywine, a detachment\r\nof the British Army under Major General Grant marched to Concord Meeting\r\nHouse, where it was joined by Lord Cornwallis and moved to near Chester.\r\n\r\nThe Americans retreated toward Chester. On the arrival of Washington,\r\nabout midnight, he sent an account of the disaster to Congress. The next\r\nday the army marched by way of Darby to Philadelphia. The main body was\r\nencamped near Germantown for two or three days to rest.\r\n\r\nWashington deemed it so important to save Philadelphia from falling into\r\nthe hands of the enemy that he resolved to risk another engagement.\r\n\r\nOn September 15 he crossed the Schuykill and marched up the Lancaster\r\nroad, with the intention of meeting the enemy. The British commander\r\nlearned of Washington’s plan to attack him, and disposed his troops to\r\nmeet the attack.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 16th Washington received information that the\r\nenemy was approaching by way of the Goshen Meeting House, and was\r\nalready in that vicinity. The two armies prepared for action. Washington\r\ndispatched an advance guard to keep the enemy in check until his army\r\nwas properly arrayed.\r\n\r\nGeneral Anthony Wayne in command of the advance, was to open the battle.\r\nSkirmishing began, but suddenly a rain storm of great violence stopped\r\nits progress. A hurried consultation was had as to whether the British\r\nshould be fought on ground so soft there was danger of losing the\r\nartillery in case of defeat.\r\n\r\nWashington gave the order to reform east of the White Horse and north of\r\nthe Lancaster road.\r\n\r\nThe Americans discovered their ammunition was damaged by the rain and\r\ncontinued to Warwick Furnace. The storm continued for some time.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 18th, Cornwallis advanced to the Lancaster road,\r\nand the following day the entire army joined at the White Horse, and\r\nmoved down the Lancaster and Swedes’ Ford road, where they encamped near\r\nthe present village of Howellville.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th General Wayne’s division was sent to French Creek to annoy\r\nthe enemy and endeavor to cut off the baggage train, and by this means\r\narrest his march toward the Schuylkill until the Americans could cross\r\nthe river higher up and pass down on the east side and intercept the\r\npassage of the river by the British.\r\n\r\nGeneral Wayne proceeded to the duty assigned him, and on the eighteenth\r\nencamped in the rear of the enemy, securely concealed from the knowledge\r\nof General Howe. Wayne’s home being in the neighborhood, he was\r\nacquainted with the locality.\r\n\r\nOn the nineteenth General Wayne watched the enemy with a view of\r\nattacking him should he move. On the twentieth, he believed the British\r\nCommander intended to take up the march, and it was his intention to\r\nadvance upon the enemy’s rear and attack while in the operation of\r\nmoving.\r\n\r\nGeneral Wayne had carefully guarded himself against surprise, planted\r\npickets and sentinels, and threw forward patrols upon the roads leading\r\nto the enemy’s camp.\r\n\r\nDuring the night a neighbor visited his quarters and advised him that\r\nthe British intended to attack him during the night. Wayne took\r\nadditional precautions, and awaited General Smallwood’s arrival with\r\nre-enforcements to enable him to take the offensive.\r\n\r\nAlthough the British commander did not know where the forces of General\r\nWayne lay, there were Tories residing in the neighborhood who did, and\r\nby these he was advised of the precise locality and of the nature of the\r\napproaches to it.\r\n\r\nHowe sent General Grey to surprise and cut him off, and moved Colonel\r\nMusgrave with the Fortieth and Fifty-fifth Regiments up the Lancaster\r\nroad, near to the Paoli Tavern, to intercept any attempt to retreat over\r\nthat route. The watchword of the Americans for that night, through some\r\ntreachery was communicated to the enemy.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grey, guided by his Tory aides, marched up the Swedes’ Ford\r\nroad, and massed his troops as near Wayne’s camp as possible. General\r\nGrey cautiously moved through the woods up the ravine, and near the\r\npresent Malvern station of the Pennsylvania Railroad.\r\n\r\nGeneral Wayne received intelligence of the enemy’s advances, immediately\r\nordered the troops under arms, many were awakened by the cry, “Up, men,\r\nthe British are on you!”\r\n\r\nThe night was dark, and the surrounding woodland made it uncertain as to\r\nthe point of attack. General Wayne ascertained, however, that the enemy\r\nwas advancing upon his right, where the artillery was placed, and\r\nordered Colonel Humpton to wheel the division by sub-platoon to the\r\nright, and march off by the left, and thus gain the road leading to the\r\nsummit of the hill.\r\n\r\nThe artillery moved off, but owing to a misapprehension the troops\r\nfailed to move, although in a position to do so. In addition to this\r\nblunder, part of the force took the wrong road, which brought the men\r\nwithin the light of their fires, and thus gave the enemy an advantage\r\nwhich should have been avoided.\r\n\r\nGeneral Wayne took the light infantry and First regiment and formed them\r\non the right, to receive the enemy and cover the retreat of the\r\nartillery.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grey had gained Wayne’s left about 1 o’clock in the morning. The\r\ntroops under Wayne met the enemy with spirit, gave them several\r\nwell-directed fires, which did considerable execution. They were,\r\nhowever, soon compelled to give way before superior numbers.\r\n\r\nGeneral Wayne with the Fourth regiment received the shock of the enemy’s\r\ncharge, and covered the retreat of the rest of his line. He rallied such\r\nof Colonel Humpton’s troops as had taken the proper course in their\r\nretreat, where they were again formed to renew the conflict.\r\n\r\nBoth parties, however drew off without further contest, and General\r\nWayne retreated to the White Horse, carrying with him his artillery and\r\nammunition.\r\n\r\nThe British attack was made by twice the number of the troops commanded\r\nby Wayne. The enemy advanced with only bayonets and light horseman’s\r\nswords in a most ferocious and merciless spirit. General Grey ordered\r\nhis men to remove the flints from their guns, that not a single shot\r\nshould be fired.\r\n\r\nThe British dashed into the woods, guided by the straggling fire of the\r\npicket, and rushed into the camp yelling.\r\n\r\nThe Americans were completely surprised, some with arms, others without,\r\nrunning in all directions in the greatest confusion.\r\n\r\nThe light infantry bayoneted every man they met. The camp was soon in\r\nflames, and this with the cries of the wounded formed a scene terrible\r\nto behold.\r\n\r\nIn the slaughter even the sick and wounded were not spared. This conduct\r\nof the British commander has stigmatized it as “British barbarity” and\r\nhas given to the action the title of the Paoli Massacre.\r\n\r\nThe loss of the Americans was about 150 killed and wounded. The British\r\nreported their loss as eight killed, but this is probably an inaccurate\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the people in the neighborhood visited the scene and\r\ndecently buried fifty-three mangled dead whose bodies were found upon\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Unholy Alliance with Delaware Indians\r\n                        Concluded at Fort Pitt,\r\n                           September 21, 1778\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen General Lachlan McIntosh was sent to relieve General Edward Hand at\r\nFort Pitt it was expected that the frontiers would be made safe, as\r\nGeneral Washington ordered the Eighth Pennsylvania and the Thirteenth\r\nVirginia detached from Valley Forge and marched to the Western post.\r\n\r\nThe plan of General McIntosh was to attack Detroit, which involved a\r\nmarch of 300 miles through a wilderness inhabited by savages, most of\r\nwhom were hostile to the American cause. This army must be carried far\r\nfrom its base of supplies, and Fort Pitt was never strong. This was a\r\nstupendous enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe Delaware tribe, who had removed from the central part of\r\nPennsylvania, were now living on the Tuscarawas and the Muskingum, and\r\nwere the only Indians who had maintained neutrality between the\r\nColonists and the British.\r\n\r\nWhite Eyes, the head sachem and the greatest chieftain ever produced by\r\nthis remarkable Indian nation, was devoted to the American cause. He\r\nrevealed a spirit of intelligent sympathy with the struggle for liberty\r\nand even hoped that a Delaware Indian State might form a fourteenth star\r\nin the American Union.\r\n\r\nPreparations were made for a formal treaty of alliance, and June, 1778,\r\nCongress ordered it to be held at Fort Pitt July 23 following, and\r\nrequested Virginia to name two Commissioners and Pennsylvania one.\r\n\r\nOn account of the Continental troops being too far distant the treaty\r\nwas postponed until September.\r\n\r\nColonel Brodhead and the Eighth Pennsylvania, which had been recruited\r\nin Western Pennsylvania, reached Fort Pitt September 10, 1778. Already\r\nthe Delaware Indians were encamped near the shore of the river a short\r\ndistance above the fort. Two days later the conference began.\r\n\r\nThis was probably the most remarkable treaty ever made in the interest\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nBy this treaty, the United States entered into an offensive and\r\ndefensive alliance with a tribe of savage Indians, recognizing them as\r\nan independent nation, guaranteeing its integrity and territory. Each\r\nparty bound itself to assist the other against enemies.\r\n\r\nThe treaty even contained a provision for the admission of an Indian\r\nState into the American Union. The Commissioners certainly knew this was\r\nimpossible, yet they deliberately provided for it in solemn treaty,\r\ntaking care, however, to subject the scheme to the approval of Congress.\r\n\r\nIn present day parlance it was a “gold brick,” the white men handed to\r\ntheir red brethren.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it was a most courageous act upon the part of the\r\nDelaware tribe to form this alliance with the Americans, as all the\r\nother Indian tribes of the West were in league with the British, and had\r\nfor months been trying to persuade the Delaware to join them.\r\n\r\nIn that alliance White Eyes exposed his people to absolute destruction\r\nby the British and their red allies. He fully realized his danger, yet\r\nhe had the courage to do what he believed to be the right thing, and he\r\nfell a martyr to his convictions.\r\n\r\nThe Shawnee were invited into the alliance, but made no response. At the\r\ntreaty the Delaware deputies were White Eyes, the chief sachem;\r\nKillbuck, a famous medicine man and war chief, and Pipe, the chief\r\nwarrior of the Wolf clan. All were attired in holiday regalia, paint,\r\nfeathers and beads.\r\n\r\nOn the part of the Americans were General McIntosh and his colonels and\r\nstaff officers. The interpreter was Job Chilloway, the noted Delaware\r\nIndian, who resided on the West Branch of the Susquehanna, and who was\r\never the true friend of the whites. Soldiers patrolled the parade ground\r\nor stood about watching the unusual scene.\r\n\r\nGeneral Andrew Lewis, one of the Virginia Commissioners, opened the\r\nconference on Saturday morning by presenting a belt of white wampum, and\r\npraising the Delaware tribesmen because they alone remained faithful to\r\ntheir treaties. He then presented a broad belt which had the wampum so\r\narranged that it depicted a red man and a white man connected by a black\r\nline, denoting a road or path. He then proposed a formal alliance,\r\ngiving a third belt, showing a white man and an Indian clasping hands.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lewis stated the intention of sending an army against Detroit\r\nand asked permission of the Delaware Indians for passage through their\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nChief White Eyes gave thanks for the offer of friendship and alliance.\r\nHe told them it was to form such an alliance that he and his comrades\r\nhad come to the council. He promised a prompt consultation and an answer\r\nin the afternoon. He was the only Indian who spoke at the conference.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of another delegation of Indians consumed much time. The new\r\narrivals were led by Wingenund, the Delaware wise man, and Nimwha, chief\r\nof the small band of the Shawnee, who lived with the Delaware at\r\nCoshocton.\r\n\r\nThe conference was resumed in the morning, when White Eyes announced the\r\nreadiness of the Indians to accept the alliance. The Commissioners\r\nannounced they would submit copy of the treaty in writing.\r\n\r\nWhite Eyes then said: “Brothers, we are become one people. The enemy\r\nIndians, as soon as they hear it, will strike us. We desire that our\r\nbrethren would build some place for our old men, women and children to\r\nremain in safety whilst our warriors go with you.”\r\n\r\nOn Monday the articles of confederation between a civilized and a savage\r\nnation were interpreted and explained to the Indians. On Wednesday White\r\nEyes accepted the treaty on behalf of the Delaware and the Shawnee.\r\n\r\nOn the following day the articles of confederation were signed in\r\ntriplicate, one copy for Congress, one for the Delaware, and one for\r\nGeneral McIntosh. There were six articles:\r\n\r\nFirst, all offenses were to be mutually forgiven; second, a perpetual\r\npeace was pledged; third, the Delaware assented to passages through\r\ntheir country for American Army and agreed to sell corn, meat and horses\r\nto the army and to furnish guides, while the Americans agreed to erect a\r\ngarrison, within the Delaware country, a fort for the protection of the\r\nold men, women and children; fourth, related to punishment for offenses\r\nonly by trial by judges of both parties, etc.; fifth, the United States\r\npledged the establishment of a fair trade under the control of an honest\r\nagent.\r\n\r\nThe sixth article was the most remarkable of all. It guaranteed the\r\nintegrity of the Delaware territory so long as the nation should keep\r\npeace with the United States, promised the Delaware nation should have a\r\nrepresentative in Congress, etc. All these articles were contingent upon\r\nthe proviso that “it meets with the approval of Congress.”\r\n\r\nOn the succeeding day, September 21, presents were given to the Delaware\r\non behalf of Congress and the Indians then departed for Coshocton, to\r\nmake preparations for joining the expedition against Detroit.\r\n\r\nChief White Eyes was treacherously killed; the soldiers spent the winter\r\nin the wilderness, where many hardships were endured, and the expedition\r\nproved a failure.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Franklin Attends Conference of Indians in\r\n                      Carlisle, September 22, 1753\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1753 the Six Nations, Shawnee, Delaware and\r\nTwightwee held a great treaty in Virginia, where they were called by\r\nGovernor Dinwiddie, but who much offended them by his failure to attend\r\nthe conference in person.\r\n\r\nOn their return the Indians sent word to Governor James Hamilton, at\r\nPhiladelphia, that they desired to negotiate a new treaty at Carlisle.\r\nThe Governor learned that Dinwiddie had not met them in Virginia and he\r\nthought Carlisle too far distant to travel on such a mission, so Isaac\r\nNorris, Speaker of the Provincial Assembly, Richard Peters, the\r\nsecretary, and Dr. Benjamin Franklin were commissioned September 22,\r\n1753, to meet and treat with the Indians.\r\n\r\nThose who today wander through the streets of historic old Carlisle\r\ncannot realize that Franklin and his companions found little more than a\r\nfrontier fort. John O'Neal, in a letter to Governor Hamilton, dated May\r\n27, 1753, says there were only five houses in the town and but twelve\r\nmen in the garrison.\r\n\r\nFort Lowther, on High street, near the Public Square, was a harbor of\r\nrefuge for pioneer families so frequently exposed to Indian attack.\r\nCourt was held in a log building on the northeast corner of Center\r\nSquare.\r\n\r\nFranklin never forgot his experience at Carlisle and referred to it\r\nfrequently. His visit to help make a new treaty with the Ohio Indians\r\nwas a mission of much importance. Through daring wiles of the French,\r\nEngland’s position in the New World was being imperiled more and more.\r\n\r\nWhat attitude the Indians would take in a contest between English and\r\nFrench was of vital importance, not only to the King, but more\r\nespecially to Pennsylvania settlers, who well knew the terror of Indian\r\nmassacres and wars.\r\n\r\nThe Indians attending the Carlisle pow-wow wanted fire water as soon as\r\nthe commissioners arrived, but Franklin and the other members were\r\nshrewd enough to promise rum only when the conference had been\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\nScarouady, an Oneida chief, sometimes called Half King, who was a person\r\nof great weight in their councils, went into caucus with the\r\ncommissioners before formal sessions began.\r\n\r\nHe regretfully advised that deliberations could not proceed until belts,\r\nstrings and goods sent by the Pennsylvania Assembly as condolences\r\narrived “to cover the graves of braves killed by the French and their\r\nIndians, and were spread out on the ground” before the assembled red\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners wanted to begin work at once and offered to furnish a\r\nlist and inventory of the delayed presents. It was then agreed to confer\r\nwith the chiefs of the “Shawnee and Delaware on the state of affairs in\r\nOhio,” pending arrival of the condolences.\r\n\r\nConrad Weiser and Andrew Montour acted as interpreters between the\r\ncommissioners and Indians, while several magistrates and freeholders\r\nattended the conference, which was formally opened on the morning of\r\nOctober 1, after the gifts costing £800, which had arrived that morning,\r\nhad been laid out on the ground.\r\n\r\nDuring the three days following, when Indians and commissioners were not\r\npassing presents to one another, speeches were delivered according to\r\nthe customary procedure of such gatherings.\r\n\r\nAt the closing of the first day, as is briefly mentioned in the report,\r\n“the goods allotted for each nation as a present of condolence were\r\ntaken away by each.”\r\n\r\nThe forms of the condolences depended entirely on Indian custom and were\r\nsettled in conference with Scarouady and Cayanguileguoa, a sensible\r\nIndian of the Mohawk Nation, and accordingly the proper belts and\r\nstrings were made ready.\r\n\r\nBut the commissioners had been compelled to await until the condolences\r\nhad arrived before they were able to assuage the Indian grief.\r\n\r\nAfter the Oneida chieftain had offered the suggestion, “We dig a grave\r\nfor your warriors killed in your country and we bury their bones,\r\ndecently wrapping them in these blankets, and with these presents we\r\ncover their graves,” the Indians aired their complaints and\r\nprotestations of loyalty to the English.\r\n\r\nIn return for all the delicate niceties of Indian procedure, which the\r\nwise Franklin had been careful to observe the red men covered graves of\r\nthe English with a beaver skin blanket and offered as occasion required\r\na string or two of wampum, belts and bundles of skins.\r\n\r\nA shell, painted green on the concave side, with a string of wampum\r\nattached, was given the commissioners as evidence that the assembled\r\nIndians had but a single heart and that “green and good and sound.”\r\n\r\nThe calumet, a pipe decorated with fine feathers, was offered in proof\r\nthat the Indians cherished no resentment against the English because of\r\nFrench inroads.\r\n\r\nThey made Andrew Montour a counselor for the Six Nations, presented him\r\nwith a belt in token of their confidence and gave notice in a speech\r\nthat a horn had been set upon his head as evidence of Indian respect for\r\none of their number who served the English.\r\n\r\nFranklin thus speaks of this treaty in his autobiography: “Being\r\ncommissioned, we went to Carlisle and met the Indians accordingly. As\r\nthese people are extremely apt to get drunk, and when so are very\r\nquarrelsome and disorderly, we strictly forbade the selling of any\r\nliquor to them; and when they complained of this restriction, we told\r\nthem, if they would continue sober during the treaty, we would give them\r\nplenty of rum when the business was over. They promised this, and they\r\nkept their promise, because they could get no rum, and the treaty was\r\nconducted very orderly and concluded to mutual satisfaction. They then\r\nclaimed and received the rum; this was in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n“They were near one hundred men, women and children, some were lodged in\r\ntemporary cabins, built in the form of a square, just without the town.\r\nIn the evening, hearing a great noise among them, the commissioners\r\nwalked out to see what was the matter.\r\n\r\n“We found they had made a great bonfire in the middle of the square;\r\nthey were all drunk, men and women quarreling and fighting. Their\r\ndark-colored bodies, seen only by the gloomy light of the bonfire,\r\nrunning after and beating one another with firebrands, accompanied by\r\ntheir horrid yellings, formed a scene the most resembling our ideas of\r\nan inferno that could be well imagined.\r\n\r\n“There was no appeasing the tumult, and we retired to our lodgings. At\r\nmidnight a number of them came thundering at our door, demanding more\r\nrum, of which we took no notice. The next day, sensible they had\r\nmisbehaved themselves in giving us that disturbance, they sent three of\r\ntheir old counselors to make their apology.”\r\n\r\nHe concludes: “That if it be the design of Providence to extirpate these\r\nsavages in order to make room for the cultivators of the earth, it seems\r\nnot impossible that rum may be the appointed means. It has already\r\nannihilated all the tribes who formerly inhabited the seacoast.”\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Boundary Dispute with Virginia Ended\r\n                   When Assembly Ratified Agreement,\r\n                           September 23, 1780\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides the Connecticut claims, which took in almost the entire half of\r\nthe Province of Pennsylvania, Virginia laid claim to a large portion of\r\nthe western part. The origin of this claim dates very far back in the\r\nhistory of the country.\r\n\r\nThe charter of 1607 granted to the London Company all the territory in\r\nAmerica lying between the 34th and 38th degrees of north latitude.\r\n\r\nIn 1609 the charter was amended and enlarged, so that it comprised a\r\nregion stretching two hundred miles north and the same distance south of\r\nPoint Comfort, and extending “up into the land throughout, from sea to\r\nsea, west and northwest.”\r\n\r\nIn 1623 the London Company was dissolved, and their territory, except\r\nwhere grants had been made to private individuals, reverted to the\r\nCrown.\r\n\r\nThe Virginians never fully accepted this decision. Penn’s grant was\r\nrespected; but any other territory within the limits of their charter\r\nthey continued to claim, notwithstanding the action of the King’s Bench.\r\n\r\nTo explore and occupy his vast domain was one of the most fascinating\r\nobjects of the early Virginians.\r\n\r\nIt was to vindicate their claim to the region about the forks of the\r\nOhio that the youthful Major George Washington was sent to the French\r\nposts in 1753.\r\n\r\nThe authorities of Pennsylvania, however, now began to contend that the\r\nclaims of Virginia overlapped the charter granted to William Penn, and\r\nsome correspondence took place between Governor Dinwiddie, of Virginia,\r\nand Governor Hamilton, of Pennsylvania, in the years 1752 and 1753.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1753 the Virginians undertook to secure possession of the\r\ncountry about the Forks of the Ohio against the common enemy, the\r\nFrench, by building a fort, where Pittsburgh now stands. The French,\r\nunder Contrecœur descended the Allegheny, drove the Virginians away, and\r\nthemselves built a stronghold at the same place, which they called Fort\r\nDuquesne.\r\n\r\nThis disputed territory remained in the hands of the French until\r\nGeneral Forbes invested Fort Duquesne, November 24, 1758. The fort was\r\nrebuilt and named Fort Pitt.\r\n\r\nNo revival of the dispute took place until January, 1774, when one Dr.\r\nJohn Conolly, a native of Lancaster, and one whom Bancroft describes as\r\n“a physician, land-jobber and subservient political intriguer,” appeared\r\nwith authority from Lord Dunmore, the governor of Virginia, and took\r\npossession of Fort Pitt, and renamed it Fort Dunmore.\r\n\r\nConolly issued a call to the public to assemble as a militia, and for\r\nthis conduct he was apprehended by Arthur (afterwards General) St.\r\nClair, a magistrate of Westmoreland County, and thrown into jail at\r\nHannastown.\r\n\r\nHe was released on bail and returned to Virginia. Here he was appointed\r\na justice of Augusta County, which the Virginians contended embraced the\r\nterritory in debate, and shortly returned to Pittsburgh with a strong\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nHe captured the court at Hannastown, and at Pittsburgh, April 9, 1774,\r\nhe arrested Justices Mackey, Smith, and McFarlane, and sent them\r\nprisoners to Staunton, Virginia.\r\n\r\nConolly’s high-handed proceedings called for action by Governor John\r\nPenn, who wrote to Governor Dunmore, complaining of Conolly’s actions,\r\nand describing the boundaries of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nGovernor Penn gave a careful delineation of the several surveys and\r\nclosed his letter by suggesting a temporary line of jurisdiction until\r\nthe affair could be settled by King George III in Council.\r\n\r\nLord Dunmore replied March 3, 1774, in which he contravened the opinions\r\nof Governor Penn and refused to comply with his suggestions. He\r\nfurthermore resented the arrest of Conolly and demanded the dismissal of\r\nSt. Clair.\r\n\r\nGovernor Penn replied, March 31, when he recapitulated the history of\r\nthe claim, and declined to dismiss St. Clair from his office.\r\n\r\nOn May 7, James Tilghman and Andrew Allen were appointed commissioners\r\non the part of Pennsylvania to settle the question in dispute. They\r\nreached Williamsburg, the capital of Virginia, May 19.\r\n\r\nGovernor Dunmore demanded their proposition in writing, and they gave it\r\nto him on the 23rd.\r\n\r\nThe substance of the paper was that the Mason and Dixon’s line should be\r\ncontinued to the end of the five degrees from the Delaware River, and\r\nfrom the end of that line a line should be run corresponding in\r\ndirection to the courses of the Delaware, and drawn at every point at\r\nthe distance of five degrees of longitude from that river. This\r\nproposition would have the western boundary of Pennsylvania of the same\r\nform as the eastern.\r\n\r\nLord Dunmore replied that he did not believe the Crown intended such an\r\nirregular western boundary. He then proceeded to explain the boundary as\r\nhe understood it.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact worthy of remark that Governor Penn’s proposition gave to\r\nVirginia nearly all that she claimed, while Dunmore’s gave to\r\nPennsylvania far more than she demanded; the boundary lines as he\r\ndefined them being almost identical with those at present established.\r\n\r\nNo agreement was reached and Lord Dunmore refused to relinquish his\r\nauthority over Fort Pitt.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Conolly’s conduct was outrageous. He not only oppressed the\r\npeople, but stirred up a war with the Indians, who committed great\r\nbarbarities.\r\n\r\nGovernor Penn could not save the situation, nor could the law furnish\r\nany protection.\r\n\r\nThe war with the mother country developed and Dunmore and Conolly took\r\nsides against the colonists.\r\n\r\nOn the night of June 7, 1775, Dunmore was compelled to seek safety on\r\nboard the “Fowney,” an English man-of-war, at York, Va., and Conolly\r\nsoon joined Dunmore in his place of refuge.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1776, the legislature of Virginia proposed a line of\r\ndemarcation, which was slightly different from those already suggested,\r\nbut Pennsylvania could not accept it.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime matters remained in a chaotic condition, especially as\r\nto Westmoreland inhabitants. But the time came when it was necessary to\r\ndo something.\r\n\r\nFinally George Bryan, John Ewing, and David Rittenhouse, on the part of\r\nPennsylvania, and Dr. James Madison and Robert Andrews, on the part of\r\nVirginia, met as commissioners at Baltimore, August 31, 1779, and after\r\nthorough consideration of the subject agreed as follows:\r\n\r\n“To extend Mason and Dixon’s line due west five degrees of longitude, to\r\nbe computed from the river Delaware, for the southern boundary of\r\nPennsylvania, and that a meridian, drawn from the western extremity\r\nthereof to the northern limit of said state, be the western boundary of\r\nsaid state forever.”\r\n\r\nThis agreement was ratified and confirmed by the legislature of\r\nVirginia, June 23, 1780, and by that of Pennsylvania, September 23,\r\n1780.\r\n\r\nIn 1782 commissioners appointed by the two states ran the lines, but\r\nthese were only temporary. In 1783, David Rittenhouse, John Lukens, John\r\nEwing, and Captain Hutchins, on the part of Pennsylvania, and Dr. James\r\nMadison, Andrew Ellicott, Robert Andrews, and T. Page, on the part of\r\nVirginia, again ran the lines, and set up stone pillars at regular\r\nintervals.\r\n\r\nThis work was accomplished in 1784, and ended further dispute in the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Two Brothers of Doan Family of Outlaw\r\n                     Sons Hanged September 24, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the Revolutionary War a number of young men either to escape from\r\nserving in army or paying fines, or for the reason that they may have\r\nsympathized with the element which opposed the independence of the young\r\ncolonies, and did not choose to enlist openly with the enemy, found a\r\nmore profitable employment in secret acts of treachery and piracy among\r\ntheir neighbors.\r\n\r\nFor that service they were amply compensated by the British, especially\r\nduring their occupancy of Philadelphia and New York City.\r\n\r\nThere were not a few such outlaws, and they did not reside in any one\r\nquarter of the State, but the most notorious of them all were several\r\nbrothers by the name of Doan.\r\n\r\nThe Doans lived in Plumstead Township, near Doylestown, Bucks County.\r\nThe father, Israel Doan, was a worthy man, but his six sons as they grew\r\nto manhood abandoned all the noble principles of the religious sect with\r\nwhich they had been reared, and retaining only so much of the outward\r\nforms as suited their nefarious schemes, they became a gang of most\r\ndesperate outlaws.\r\n\r\nThe sons were professedly Tories and pursued for a time a very\r\nprofitable trade in stealing the horses and cattle of their Whig\r\nneighbors, and disposing of them to the British Army, then in\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\nThe brothers lived in the highways and hedges and waged a predatory and\r\nretaliatory war upon their persecutors. They were men of fine figures\r\nand addresses, elegant horsemen, great runners and excellent at\r\nstratagems and escapes.\r\n\r\nThe Doans were distinguished from their youth for great muscular\r\nactivity. They could run and jump beyond all competitors, and it is said\r\none of them could jump over a Conestoga wagon.\r\n\r\nThey delighted to injure public property, but did no injury to the weak,\r\nthe poor, or the peaceful.\r\n\r\nOne of the brothers, Joseph, was a school teacher in Plumstead Township.\r\nTwo of the brothers had joined the British in Philadelphia, and through\r\nthem the stolen horses were disposed of and the proceeds shared.\r\n\r\nThe Doans at school were often displaying their pockets full of guineas,\r\nwhich at first were believed to be counterfeit; but subsequent events\r\nproved their genuineness, and disclosed the source from which they had\r\nprocured so considerable an amount of gold.\r\n\r\nSuspicion had long fastened upon the family; they were closely watched\r\nand eventually, about the year 1782, the stealing of a horse belonging\r\nto John Shaw, of Plumstead, was positively traced to them. This brought\r\nupon Mr. Shaw and a few others, who were active in their detection, the\r\ncombined malignity of the whole banditti and it was not long before they\r\nobtained their revenge.\r\n\r\nThe Doans added to their band another villain of kindred spirit by the\r\nname of Robert Steele. Under the leadership of Moses Doan and Joseph,\r\nthe schoolmaster, the seven outlaws fell upon Mr. Shaw in the dead of\r\nthe night, in his own house, bruised and lacerated him most cruelly, and\r\ndecamped with all his horses and everything of value they could take\r\nfrom the house.\r\n\r\nA son of Mr. Shaw was dispatched to the nearest neighbors for assistance\r\nand to raise the hue and cry after the robbers. But these neighbors\r\nbeing Mennonites, conscientiously opposed to bearing arms and having\r\nbesides an instinctive dread of personal danger, declined interfering in\r\nthe matter. Such was the timidity and cautiousness manifested in those\r\ntimes between the nearest neighbors, when of different religions and\r\npolitical sentiments.\r\n\r\nYoung Shaw, however, soon raised a number of the inhabitants, part of\r\nwhom responded to his father’s call for assistance, and part of whom\r\narmed themselves and went in pursuit of the robbers.\r\n\r\nWhen the Doans finished with Mr. Shaw, they proceeded to the house of\r\nJoseph Grier, and robbed him, and then went to a tavern kept by Colonel\r\nRobert Robinson, a very corpulent man, whom they dragged out of bed,\r\nbound him in a most excruciating position, and placed him naked in the\r\nmidst of them; then they whipped him until their ferocity was satisfied.\r\n\r\nThey robbed and abused several other persons the same night, and then\r\nfled into Montgomery County. Here they were overtaken, somewhere on\r\nSkippack, and so hotly pursued that they were glad to abandon the five\r\nhorses on which they rode, and seek safer refuge in the thicket. Joseph\r\nwas shot through the cheeks, and captured when he fell from his horse.\r\nThe others escaped.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner was confined in jail at Newtown, then the county town of\r\nBucks, but while awaiting trial effected his escape. He fled into New\r\nJersey, where he taught school, under an assumed name, for nearly a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Government offered a reward of $800 for him or his brothers,\r\ndead or alive. While Joseph was in a saloon one evening a man was heard\r\nto say that he would shoot any one of the Doans on sight for the sake of\r\nthe reward. Joseph took the hint and made his way into Canada.\r\n\r\nMoses, the captain of the gang, with two of his brothers, had taken\r\nrefuge in a cabin occupied by a drunken man, near the mouth of Tohickon\r\nCreek. Mr. Shaw learned of the place of their concealment, rallied a\r\nparty with Colonel Hart as leader, and surrounded them.\r\n\r\nInstead of shooting them down at once, Colonel Hart opened the door, and\r\ncried out, “Ah! You’re here, are you?”\r\n\r\nThe Doans seized their guns and shot down Mr. Kennedy, one of the party.\r\nTwo of the outlaws crawled through a window unseen, and escaped in the\r\nwoods. Moses, the most respectable of all the brothers, surrendered.\r\nImmediately after he gave himself up he was shot down by one of the\r\nattacking party. It was discovered that the man who killed Moses was a\r\nformer member of his outlaw band and killed him to close his mouth\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nTwo others of the Doan brothers, Abraham and Levi, were later captured\r\nin Chester County, and afterward hanged on September 24, 1788, in\r\nPhiladelphia. Their bodies were taken back to Plumstead Township for\r\nburial.\r\n\r\nTheir valor and generosity made them respected above ordinary robbers,\r\nand many temperate people in the county expressed or felt great\r\ncommiseration for them.\r\n\r\nThe Doans made a desperate fight to obtain pardons and their case caused\r\nintense excitement throughout the entire State, but they paid the price\r\ntheir lawlessness deserved.\r\n\r\nMany years after the Shaw robbery, young Shaw became a magistrate in\r\nDoylestown. One day Joseph Doan, the robber and schoolmaster, now a\r\nrefugee from prison, entered his office. The Squire gave him a cool\r\nreception but inquired of his errand.\r\n\r\nThe old scoundrel had returned from Canada to bring suit against a\r\nQuaker for a small legacy of $40. He had the impudence to require Squire\r\nShaw’s services, although he had robbed and nearly killed his father.\r\nSquire Shaw performed his professional duties, but treated his unwelcome\r\nclient with cool disdain and hatred.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Dutch Gain Control of the Delaware River\r\n                           September 25, 1655\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the arrival of John Claudius Rysingh, as the successor of John\r\nPrintz, Governor of New Sweden, May 20, 1654, he became a very\r\naggressive officer. He began his administration by capturing the Dutch\r\nFort Casimer, thus destroying the authority of the Dutch on the Delaware\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\nOn June 17, he held a great convocation of Indians at Printz Hall, on\r\nTinicum Island, now Essington, on the Delaware River near Chester, at\r\nwhich a new treaty was successfully consummated.\r\n\r\nThe triumph of Rysingh was regarded as a reconquest of usurped territory\r\nand no other means to reclaim it by the Dutch were apprehended. That was\r\na fatal delusion, for at the close of 1654, while estimates were being\r\nmade in Sweden for the support of their colony during the ensuing year,\r\non a peace basis, an armament was being fitted out in Holland not only\r\nsufficient “to replace matters on the Delaware in their former\r\nposition,” but “to drive out the Swedes from every side of the river.”\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1655 five armed vessels, well equipped and with 600\r\nmen, were forwarded by Peter Stuyvesant, the Dutch Governor at\r\nManhattan. This expedition was commanded by Stuyvesant in person and\r\narrived in Delaware Bay Monday afternoon, September 5, 1655.\r\n\r\nBy Friday the fleet reached Fort Casimer, now in control of the Swedes,\r\nand renamed Fort Trinity. The garrison was in command of Sven Schute,\r\nwhile Governor Rysingh, in person, had charge of Christina, in what is\r\nnow Wilmington, Del.\r\n\r\nTo prevent a communication of the two forts Stuyvesant had landed fifty\r\nmen. The demand made by the Dutch was a “direct restitution of their own\r\nproperty,” to which Commander Schute, after having had an interview with\r\nStuyvesant, reluctantly yielded on the following day upon very favorable\r\nterms of capitulation.\r\n\r\nThe nine guns of the fort were to be reserved for the Swedish “crown”\r\nand removed when convenient. The Swedes were to march out, twelve fully\r\nequipped, the rest with their side-arms. Stuyvesant proclaimed that\r\nSwedes who would take the oath of allegiance to him might remain\r\nunmolested, and twenty did so.\r\n\r\nThe surrender of Schute was unknown to Governor Rysingh, and his\r\nposition was virtually untenable. He had placed some of his best men in\r\nthe captured fort, and an additional party, sent the very day of the\r\nsurrender. He prepared for resistance, collected all the people for the\r\ndefense of Fort Christina, and strengthened the ramparts.\r\n\r\nOn September 12, the Dutch appeared on the opposite side of Christina\r\nCreek, and the siege began, which was continued uninterruptedly for\r\nfourteen days.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th, Stuyvesant sent a letter “claiming the whole river.”\r\nRysingh replied asserting the rights of the Swedes on the Delaware and\r\nprotesting against the Dutch invasion. Stuyvesant renewed his demand,\r\nand Rysingh next urged that the boundaries between the Swedish and Dutch\r\ncolonies be settled by the Governments at home, or by commissioners to\r\nbe agreed upon.\r\n\r\nOnly delay resulted. Stuyvesant was cocksure of his ability to capture\r\nthe fort, and was satisfied to wait. It would have been folly in\r\nRysingh, with his thirty men to have begun to fight. During the long\r\nsiege no one was killed or wounded. September 25, Rysingh surrendered. A\r\nformal capitulation was drawn up and signed by the two commanders on the\r\nparade-ground outside the fort.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers were to march out with the honors of war. The guns and\r\neverything to remain the property of the Swedes. The Swedish settlers\r\nmight stay or go, as they chose, and for a year and six weeks, if they\r\nstayed, need not take the Dutch oath of allegiance.\r\n\r\nSwedes who remained should enjoy the Lutheran faith, and have a minister\r\nto instruct them. Rysingh and the commissary, Elswick, were to be taken\r\nto Manhattan, and thence provided with passage to Europe. Thus ended the\r\nshort but exciting career of Governor Rysingh, and with him fell the\r\nwhole Swedish Colony.\r\n\r\nSoon thereafter, Rysingh with other Swedish officials, proceeded to\r\nManhattan. Rysingh, Lindstrom, the engineer; Elswick, the commissary,\r\nand the two clergymen, Hjort and Nertunius, sailed on a Dutch merchant\r\nvessel early in November, and were landed in Plymouth, England, where a\r\nreport of the Dutch conquest was made to Lyderberg, the Swedish\r\nAmbassador to England.\r\n\r\nHad not internal troubles arisen in Sweden at this time, their claim\r\nmight have been pressed with effect, but in 1664 the whole of New\r\nNetherlands was seized by the English, and both Sweden and Holland had\r\nlost their colonies. Neither was likely to obtain much satisfaction from\r\nthe other, and the controversy faded away.\r\n\r\nMany improvements had been made by the Swedes, from Henlopen to the\r\nFalls of Alumingh. They laid the foundation of Upland, the present\r\nChester; Korsholm Fort was built at Passyunk; Manayunk Fort was placed\r\nat the mouth of the Schuylkill; they marked the sites of Nya Wasa and\r\nGripsholm, somewhere near the confluence of the Delaware and Schuylkill,\r\nStraus Mijk, Nieu Causeland, the present New Castle; and forts were\r\nerected at Kingsessing, Wicacoa, Finland and other places.\r\n\r\nThe Swedes lived at peace with the Indians. The Government of the Dutch\r\nwas established by the appointment of John Paul Jacquet as vice director\r\nand commander-in-chief, and Andreas Hudde as secretary and surveyor,\r\nkeeper of the keys of the fort, etc.\r\n\r\nThe overthrow of the Swedish authority on the Delaware was complete and\r\nfinal, and for a period of nine years the white settlements on the\r\nriver, on both sides, remained wholly under control of the Dutch. The\r\nSwedes lived together, mostly north of Christina, and the Dutch gathered\r\nabout Fort Casimer, where a little hamlet sprang up, which became known\r\nas New Amstel, the New Castle of the English and of the present.\r\n\r\nThe authority centered at New Amstel. Christina was eclipsed, and\r\nTinicum ceased to have importance except as the residence of Madam\r\nPopegoja and the location of a church. The log forts at both places\r\nrotted down and were not rebuilt.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1657, Jacob Alricks assumed the governorship of the colony for\r\nthe Dutch, when Hudde was appointed to command at Fort Christina, the\r\nname of which was changed to Altona.\r\n\r\nStuyvesant again visited the Delaware in May, 1658. At Tinicum he\r\nconferred with Sheriff Van Dyck, Magistrate Olaf Stille, Mathys Hansson,\r\nPeter Rambo and Peter Cock. These and Sven Schute and others took the\r\noath of allegiance to the Dutch authority and were granted a number of\r\nrequests.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1658, William Beekman was appointed by Stuyvesant to represent\r\nthe Dutch West India Company on the Delaware.\r\n\r\nBut Pennsylvania was soon to be wrested from the Dutch and England\r\ngained possession October 1, 1664.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               British Under General Howe Invest City of\r\n                    Philadelphia, September 26, 1777\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the defeat of the American Army in the battle of Brandywine,\r\nSeptember 11, 1777, the British did not pursue Washington’s Army, which\r\nmarched to Chester and then to Germantown. Here provisions and\r\nammunition, both much needed, were obtained.\r\n\r\nThe British advanced toward Philadelphia, which was unprepared to make\r\nan adequate defense, and General Mifflin, who was to take command, was\r\ntoo ill to do so.\r\n\r\nWhen the news reached the city, early on the morning of September 19,\r\nthat the British had crossed the Schuylkill, all was in confusion.\r\n\r\nCongress and the Supreme Executive Council of the State, which had\r\nremained in Philadelphia during the exciting events transpiring before\r\nthe city, now adjourned to meet elsewhere, the former, on the 18th, to\r\nmeet in Lancaster. After a flight to Bethlehem and then via Reading it\r\nreached Lancaster, where it convened on the 27th, but three days later\r\nremoved to York, which became the capital of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe State Government remained until the 24th, when it also went to\r\nLancaster, the archives, etc., having previously been removed to Easton.\r\nThe first meeting of Wharton and his councilors was held in Lancaster\r\nSeptember 29.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th Washington passed the Schuylkill at Parkers Ford, leaving\r\nWayne with 2000 men on the west side to fall upon any detachment of the\r\nenemy or destroy his baggage. That night occurred the Paoli massacre.\r\n\r\nThe British crossed the Schuylkill at Fatland Ford on the 22d. General\r\nHowe established headquarters at Norristown on the 23d and 24th.\r\n\r\nWashington had marched his army in the direction of Reading. On the 25th\r\nthe British began an encampment at Germantown, Howe making Stenton his\r\nheadquarters.\r\n\r\nLord Cornwallis entered Philadelphia on September 26 at the head of a\r\ndetachment of British and Hessian grenadiers.\r\n\r\nAn American flotilla held the channel of the Delaware River below the\r\ncity, but the British immediately constructed batteries which repulsed\r\nan attack the following day.\r\n\r\nThe main army of the enemy remained in camp at Germantown. Thus the\r\nrichest and most populous capital of the whole confederation fell into\r\nthe enemy’s hands, after a sanguinary battle, and a series of maneuvers\r\nno less masterly than painful to the two armies.\r\n\r\nWashington, descending along the left bank of the Schuylkill, approached\r\nto within sixteen miles of Germantown, where he encamped at Skippack\r\nCreek.\r\n\r\nGeneral Howe, having occupied Philadelphia, at once took measures to\r\nsecure the unobstructed passage of his fleet up the Delaware. Colonel\r\nSterling was sent with a detachment to attack the American fort at\r\nBillingsport, on the Jersey side of the Delaware River, as its capture\r\nwould place it in their power to make a passage through the obstructions\r\nin the channel and enable their vessels to approach within striking\r\ndistance of Fort Mifflin.\r\n\r\nColonel Sterling’s attack was successful October 2, as no resistance was\r\noffered by the small garrison under Colonel Bradford. They had taken off\r\nall the ammunition and some of the cannon, spiking those that remained\r\nand burned the barracks.\r\n\r\nWhile this action was in progress, General Washington regarded it as a\r\nfavorable opportunity for making an attack on the British force encamped\r\nat Germantown, and with between eight and nine thousand Continentals,\r\nbesides some militia marched toward that place on the night of October\r\n3.\r\n\r\nWhen Washington gave the order to retire the Americans executed their\r\nretreat in good order, followed by the British for about nine miles.\r\n\r\nThe American Army gathered at the back of Perkiomen Creek with a post\r\nformed on the hillside of the road near White Marsh Church, and\r\nWashington at Pennypacker’s mill.\r\n\r\nThe Congress expressed its approbation, both of the plan of enterprise\r\nand the courage with which it was executed, for which votes of thanks\r\nwere given to General Washington and the army.\r\n\r\nOn October 13 the Assembly at Lancaster established a Council of Safety\r\nconsisting of the members of the Supreme Executive Council and John\r\nBayard, Jonathan Dickinson Sergeant, Jonathan B. Smith, David\r\nRittenhouse, Joseph Gardner, Robert Whitehill, Christopher Marshall,\r\nJames Smith, of York; Jacob Arndt, Curtis Grubb, James Cannon and\r\nWilliam Henry with power to punish even capitally in a summary manner,\r\nand to take at their appraisement any necessaries for the army.\r\n\r\nA rule also was made against profiteers, and any person who should buy\r\nup more bar-iron, leather, salt, wheat, cattle or other merchandise, or\r\nvictuals, than proper for his own need and supply should be punished\r\nseverely.\r\n\r\nDuring the British occupation there were as many as 20,000 troops in and\r\nabout Philadelphia. General Howe lived for a time in Stenton, the home\r\nbuilt by James Logan, and later in the Samuel Morris house; he also\r\nlived for a time in the Perot mansion, which in 1793, was the residence\r\nof General Washington, while President of the United States. During the\r\ntime he stayed in Philadelphia he seized and kept for his own use Mary\r\nPemberton’s coach and horses, with which he rode about town.\r\n\r\nGeneral Knyphausen lived in General Cadwallader’s mansion, on Second\r\nStreet; Lord Cornwallis dwelt in David Lewis’ house, Second, above\r\nSpruce Street; Major André dwelt in Benjamin Franklin’s mansion. Other\r\nofficers occupied fine residences and it was a season of much social\r\ngayety.\r\n\r\nOn October 19 the main body of the British Army left Germantown and\r\nencamped behind the line of redoubts in the Northern Liberties.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia was now walled in from river to river by lines of British\r\ntroops, but yet the British men-of-war commanded by General Howe’s\r\nbrother, Lord Howe, could not freely pass the obstructions in the\r\nDelaware River.\r\n\r\nThe artillery were quartered in Chestnut Street, between Third and Sixth\r\nStreets, the State House yard being used as a park. The Forty-second\r\nHighlanders occupied Chestnut Street below Third, and the Fifteenth\r\nRegiment was quartered in Market Street, in and about Fifth Street.\r\n\r\nLater in October General Washington sent General McDougall to attack\r\n1500 British at Gray’s Ferry. Generals Sullivan and Greene were to make\r\na feint along the Germantown road. Greene got as far as Three Mile Run,\r\nwhere he united with Sullivan and waited for the signal that McDougall\r\nhad begun the attack. The enemy had called in his troops at Gray’s Ferry\r\nand the Americans were obliged to return.\r\n\r\nThe English forced the evacuation of Fort Mifflin, November 15, and Fort\r\nMercer was abandoned the 20th, but, in spite of this handicap, the\r\nAmerican fleet successfully passed Philadelphia and took refuge above\r\nBristol.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               British Open Hostilities in Long Siege on\r\n                    Fort Mifflin, September 27, 1777\r\n\r\n\r\nThe British Army was in possession of Philadelphia, but the\r\ncommunication was not open with their fleet, and General Washington in\r\nevacuating the city had placed a garrison in Fort Mifflin, not as strong\r\nas the importance and exigencies of the place required, but such as the\r\nsituation of his army could afford.\r\n\r\nFort Mifflin was nothing more than a wooden fort with an inclosure of\r\npalisades. It was situated on Mud Island, on the Pennsylvania side of\r\nthe Delaware River. The small Pennsylvania fleet was in command of\r\nCommodore John Hazlewood.\r\n\r\nThe British were not unacquainted with the miserable situation of the\r\nfort and knew its weaknesses and the best means to reduce it.\r\n\r\nOn September 27 the enemy on Providence Island opened two mortars and\r\nthree heavy guns against the southeast blockhouse. That left these\r\nbatteries unsupported, which gave an opportunity for Colonel Smith to\r\norder a sally above and below.\r\n\r\nTwo parties supported by the galleys under Commodore Hazlewood landed on\r\nthe beach of Providence Island and stormed the battery, which was\r\ndefended by two officers and sixty British, who surrendered themselves.\r\nThey were carried into the fort before the enemy’s guards could attack\r\nthe Americans, but not before the guns were spiked.\r\n\r\nFrom October 10 to the 21st a severe fire was kept up; the two west\r\nblockhouses were ruined and the north one blown up by the fall of\r\nseveral shells.\r\n\r\nThe enemy, seeing the breaches made to the palisades, hoped to gain\r\npossession of the fort, and as it was very important for their remaining\r\nin Philadelphia that the communication be open, they determined a\r\ngeneral storm on Mud Island October 22.\r\n\r\nPrevious to it, in the evening of the 21st, the Hessian brigade crossed\r\nat Cooper’s Ferry to storm Fort Mercer, on the Jersey shore about 1500\r\nyards northeast of Fort Mifflin and up the river. The attack was so rash\r\nthat even success could not justify its temerity.\r\n\r\nBefore the storm of the fort was attempted Colonel Donop sent a flag to\r\nColonel Christopher Green, who commanded the fort, threatening to put\r\nthe garrison to the sword if he did not surrender it immediately.\r\nColonel Green answered with disdain, saying he would defend it till the\r\nlast drop of his blood. About an hour before night the attack was begun\r\non the north and south side.\r\n\r\nBoth the British attacks were expected. The artillery and musketry of\r\nthe fort and the heavy guns of the galleys poured grapeshot and cannon\r\nballs upon them and made great slaughter. They advanced as far as the\r\nabattis, and being repulsed with great loss, they left their commanding\r\nofficer dying and retreated with hurry and confusion. They rallied in\r\nthe woods, and leaving their wounded and dead, about 300, in the hands\r\nof the victors, retired to Philadelphia the same night.\r\n\r\nColonel Green and the officers who had displayed so much courage in\r\nrepulsing the enemy, treated the wounded with much humanity. Colonel\r\nDonop was attended with the greatest care, but he died a few days after\r\nthe action, and was buried with the honors of war.\r\n\r\nThe morning after the attack on Fort Mercer it became Fort Mifflin’s\r\nturn. On the 22d, about 9 o’clock, the ships Eagle, Somerset, Isis,\r\nAugusta, Pearl, Liverpool and several frigates, with a galley, came up\r\nto the chevaux de frise, 500 yards from the fort. At the same time the\r\nland batteries, the fort batteries and the American galleys and the\r\nBritish squadron engaged.\r\n\r\nThe firing continued until noon with relentless fury; the fort\r\nfrequently fired red-hot balls, one of which struck the Augusta, a\r\nsixty-four-gun ship, she took fire, and in a moment was ablaze, and soon\r\nafter blew up with a thundering noise, before the enemy could take out\r\nall their hands.\r\n\r\nA moment after, the Merlin, a twenty-two-gun frigate, ran ashore below\r\nthe Augusta, and as she could not be removed before the explosion, took\r\nfire and also blew up.\r\n\r\nThe other ships, frightened by the fate of these two, retired below Hog\r\nIsland; and the land batteries, which had hoisted the bloody flag, to\r\nwarn the garrison that they were not to expect any quarter, continued\r\ntheir fighting until evening.\r\n\r\nThe weakened garrison had been re-inforced by Pennsylvania and Virginia\r\ntroops, but Colonel Smith found the garrison in great danger from\r\nfatigue and salt provisions, the water they had to wade through, the\r\ncold nights and constant firing by the enemy turned many men to the\r\nhospital.\r\n\r\nThe enemy suffered also from the inclemency of the weather, and the\r\noverflowing of the island. The water was two feet deep in their fort.\r\n\r\nThe British, believing they must evacuate Philadelphia or take the fort,\r\nmade new batteries, and on November 8 kept up an incessant fire.\r\n\r\nAll the palisades were broken down and the block houses ruined. The\r\nditch filled up with mud. Captain Treat and his lieutenant were killed.\r\nColonel Smith was wounded and the garrison nearly exhausted.\r\n\r\nMajor Thayer with some New England troops relieved the garrison. Major\r\nFleury would not be relieved and remained with the garrison.\r\n\r\nOn November 15 the enemy made a furious attack by the river and land and\r\nfloating batteries on the fort.\r\n\r\nThe ships came as near the fort as possible in the main channel, and the\r\nVigilant, carrying 24-pounders, came up under the protection of the land\r\nbatteries, behind Hog Island, and anchored forty yards from the angle of\r\nthe battery.\r\n\r\nFort Mifflin had been so much exposed on that side that on it did not\r\nremain a single gun. Major Thayer ordered the 32-pounder to be carried\r\nthere. Before the Vigilant began to fire that single gun put fourteen\r\nshots in her board. But as soon as she was at anchor and began to play\r\nall resistance became impossible.\r\n\r\nIn three or four broadsides not only the parapet and the carriages but\r\neven the irons of the guns themselves were broken, and in half an hour\r\nnot a gun in the fort was able to fire.\r\n\r\nAnother sloop of war joined the Vigilant and played against the fort all\r\nthe afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe garrison was buried in ruins, unable to retreat during the day and\r\nunwilling to do it as long as they could expect re-enforcements, had not\r\nany expectation but to sell their lives dearly as they could.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to defend the fort with so small a force, and Major\r\nThayer called for re-enforcements from Fort Mercer or he must evacuate\r\nthe fort. At that moment Major Fleury and Major Talbot were wounded and\r\nanother officer of artillery killed.\r\n\r\nAt 10 o’clock at night, as no re-enforcements had arrived from New\r\nJersey, it was impossible to defend the fort any longer.\r\n\r\nMajor Thayer evacuated the fort with a degree of firmness equal to the\r\nbravery of his defense. He set fire to the remains, and with less than\r\n200 men, having carried off all the wounded, he arrived at Fort Mercer\r\nabout 1 o’clock in the morning, being the last man to march out of the\r\nfort.\r\n\r\nThe British took possession of Fort Mifflin half an hour after the\r\nAmericans left it.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Colonel William Plunket Defeats Yankees\r\n                  in Pennamite War, September 28, 1775\r\n\r\n\r\nThere had been four years of tranquil enjoyment among the Yankee\r\nsettlers at Wyoming following the conclusion, in 1771, of the first\r\nPennamite War. The Proprietaries had been defeated and driven out, and\r\nfor four years they made no attempt to retake their property.\r\n\r\nWith the defeat of Dick and Ogden, August, 1771, the Penns were actually\r\ndriven out of Wyoming and the Yankee settlers poured into the valley in\r\nsuch numbers that it was considered advisable to erect five new\r\ntownships, each five miles square, along the West Branch of the\r\nSusquehanna River, on the lands of the Susquehanna Company.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, in 1771 the township of Charlestown was erected at the\r\nmouth of Muncy Creek, now Lycoming County; the township of Judea was\r\nerected above the mouth of Limestone Run, which is in the center of the\r\npresent borough of Milton.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1773, the township of Westminster was erected above the mouth of\r\nBuffalo Creek, in what is now Union County.\r\n\r\nIt was intended that another township, to be called New Simsburg, should\r\nbe erected on the south side of the West Branch, opposite the mouth of\r\nPine Creek. This survey was never made, but the site selected was\r\nopposite the present borough of Jersey Shore, and included the beautiful\r\nisland at that place.\r\n\r\nThe fifth town, called Salem, was erected on the North Branch, May,\r\n1773, below the mouth of Shickshinny Creek.\r\n\r\nNorthumberland County was erected March 21, 1772, and its territory,\r\nwhich embraced 462 square miles, included the entire Wyoming Valley,\r\nwhich was placed in the seventh and last township, called Wyoming.\r\n\r\nDuring that summer a number of settlers arrived in Turbot Township from\r\nthe State of New Jersey, among whom were John, Cornelius and Peter\r\nVincent and their families. John and Peter were brothers and Cornelius\r\nwas the son of John. They settled on a plantation one mile below the\r\nmouth of Warrior Run, which is two miles north of the present borough of\r\nMilton.\r\n\r\nJohn immediately became the leader of this pioneer settlement and\r\ndominant factor and partisan of the Connecticut interest. In May, 1775,\r\nthe Governor of Connecticut appointed him a justice of the peace for\r\nLitchfield County. Accompanied by his son and several others, he went to\r\nWyoming in August and requested a number of people to go to the West\r\nBranch and make settlements.\r\n\r\nMajor William Judd, Joseph Sluman, Esq., and about eighty others arrived\r\nat Vincent’s September 23, and two days later Judd and Sluman wrote a\r\njointly signed letter to Judge William Plunket, in which they\r\nacknowledged they had come with a view of settling, and stated that as\r\nthis might be a “matter of much conversation among the inhabitants, we\r\nare willing to acquaint you with the principles on which we are come. In\r\nthe first place, we intend no hostilities; we will not disturb, molest\r\nor endeavor to dispossess any person of his property, or in any ways\r\nabuse his person by threats or any action that shall tend thereto. And,\r\nas we are commissioners of the peace from the Colony of Connecticut, we\r\nmean to be governed by the laws of that colony, and shall not refuse the\r\nexercise of the law to those of the inhabitants that are now dwellers\r\nhere on their request, as the Colony of Connecticut extended last May\r\ntheir jurisdiction over the land. Finally, as we are determined to\r\ngovern ourselves as above mentioned, we expect that those who think the\r\ntitle of this land is not in this colony will give us no uneasiness or\r\ndisturbance in our proposed settlement.”\r\n\r\nIf Major Judd and his party really supposed that their movements would\r\nmeet with no opposition, they were egregiously mistaken. It is also\r\nquite evident they prepared for defense.\r\n\r\nAccording to the deposition of Peter Smith, one detachment was on guard\r\nat a schoolhouse at Freeland’s Mills, three miles above the mouth of\r\nWarrior Run, and another at John Vincent’s house.\r\n\r\nThe report reached the county seat at Sunbury that the settlers had\r\nbrought along entrenching tools, also swivels to be used in the\r\nentrenchments.\r\n\r\nA petition was immediately prepared and sent to Governor John Penn, as\r\nthe Commander-in-Chief of the Province of Pennsylvania, which was signed\r\nby William Cooke, Sheriff; James Murray, Coroner; William Plunket,\r\nPresident Judge; Samuel Hunter, County Lieutenant and Justice; Benjamin\r\nAlison, Robert Moodie, Michael Troy, Ellis Hughes and William Maclay,\r\nAssociate Justices.\r\n\r\nThe petitioners set forth that their utmost efforts had failed to halt\r\nthe “ambitious designs and enterprises of the intruders from the Colony\r\nof Connecticut. That they had been re-enforced with fresh numbers:\r\nOfficers, civil and military. Swarms of emissaries are seducing the\r\nignorant, frightening the timorous, and denouncing the utmost vengeance\r\nagainst any who may be hardy enough to oppose them—In fine, to such a\r\nsituation we are already reduced as to be under the hard necessity of\r\nkeeping constant guards, not only to prevent the destruction of our\r\njail, but for the security of our houses and persons, all of which are\r\nviolently threatened.”\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for action on the above petition the militia of\r\nNorthumberland County was called out, and September 25 a company of\r\nfifty men left Fort Augusta to join companies from other points, to\r\ndemand the reason for “this intrusion and hostile appearance.”\r\n\r\nOn September 28 the Yankees at their encampment at John Vincent’s were\r\nattacked by the Provincial forces under Colonel Plunket. Just how much\r\nresistance was offered is not a matter of record, but that there was a\r\nbattle fought is evidenced by the fact that one Yankee was killed and\r\neight wounded.\r\n\r\nPlunket’s militiamen collected all the movable property, which was then\r\nand there divided among the victors. The torch was applied and all the\r\nbuildings burned. They then marched the men, as prisoners, to Sunbury,\r\nwhere they were confined in jail. The women and children had been sent\r\nback to their friends and relatives at Wyoming.\r\n\r\nAt the hearing of the prisoners, Major Judd and Joseph Sluman, the\r\nleaders, were sent to Philadelphia, where they were confined in gaol,\r\nuntil December 20, when they were released by resolution of Congress.\r\nThree others were detained ten days in the gaol at Sunbury, and the\r\nremainder were dismissed.\r\n\r\nThis action of the county authorities and militia was approved by the\r\nProvincial Assembly in a resolution which was passed October 27, 1775:\r\n\r\n“Resolved, That the inhabitants of the County of Northumberland, settled\r\nunder the jurisdiction of this Province, were justifiable and did their\r\nduty in repelling the said intruders and preventing the further\r\nextension of the settlements.”\r\n\r\nNo doubt this expedition resulted in breaking up the Connecticut\r\nsettlements on the West Branch, and the Pennsylvania claimants remained\r\nundisturbed in full possession of the territory.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Captain John Smith Who First Meets Native\r\n                   Pennsylvanians Sailed for England,\r\n                           September 29, 1609\r\n\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no doubt but that the first European to meet the\r\nIndians who resided in what is now Pennsylvania was Captain John Smith.\r\n\r\nThis adventurer explored the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries in 1608,\r\nand made a map of his observations, which with the one he made at a\r\nlater date, of his explorations along the New England coast, were for\r\nmany years recognized as the authority for this hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch who first came to these shores formed an acquaintance with the\r\nIndians in 1615, and the Swedes first met them in 1638.\r\n\r\nIt seems, therefore, that a story about this intrepid navigator,\r\nstatesman, soldier, and writer is timely.\r\n\r\nCaptain John Smith, founder of the Virginia Colony, was an English\r\nsoldier, a native of Willoughby, in Lincolnshire, where he was born\r\nJanuary, 1579; he died in London, June 21, 1631.\r\n\r\nFrom early youth he was a soldier, enlisting in 1596, in the French Army\r\nto fight against Spain, but after the peace of 1598, he transferred his\r\nservices to the insurgents in the Netherlands, and there remained until\r\nabout 1600.\r\n\r\nReturning home he almost immediately started on a career of marvelous\r\nadventure.\r\n\r\nHe sailed from France to Italy, where he was thrown overboard because it\r\nwas learned he was a Protestant, but he was rescued by a pirate and\r\nlanded on Italian soil.\r\n\r\nHe traveled through Italy and Dalmatia to Styria and fought with the\r\nAustrian Army against the Turks, distinguished himself in Hungary and\r\nTransylvania, for which service he was ennobled and pensioned.\r\n\r\nTaken prisoner by the Turks, Smith was sent a slave to Constantinople,\r\nwhere he won the affections of his young mistress. He was sent by her to\r\nher brother in the Crimea, with a letter avowing her attachment. The\r\nindignant Turk cruelly maltreated Smith, when the latter one day slew\r\nhis taskmaster, put on the Ottoman’s clothes, mounted a horse and\r\nescaped to a Russian port.\r\n\r\nOn his return to England, in 1605, Bartholomew Gosnold persuaded Smith\r\nto engage in founding a colony in Virginia, and at the age of\r\ntwenty-seven years, already greatly renowned, he sailed from Blackwell\r\nfor America, December 16, 1606, with Captain C. Newport, who commanded\r\nthree vessels that bore one hundred and five emigrants.\r\n\r\nSmith was accompanied by men of property, and the voyage being by the\r\nsouthern route was long and tedious. They landed, May 13, 1607, about\r\nfifty miles from the mouth of the river they called the James, where\r\nthey built Jamestown, and chose that for the seat of the new empire.\r\n\r\nCaptain Smith, with Newport and twenty men, explored the James River as\r\nfar as the falls, the site of Richmond, and made the acquaintance of\r\nPowhatan, emperor of thirty Indian tribes.\r\n\r\nOn the voyage to Virginia, Smith had become boastful and arrogant,\r\ncausing him to be much disliked by Wingfield, of the London Company.\r\n\r\nOn his return from the first exploration trip Smith found Wingfield had\r\nset himself up as president, and that he was under arrest, but was\r\nacquitted at the trial and took his seat in the council, when that body\r\ndemanded that the president should pay Smith £200 for false\r\nimprisonment.\r\n\r\nAll of Wingfield’s property was seized to pay it, when Smith generously\r\nplaced it in the public store for the use of the colony.\r\n\r\nSickness prostrated the colony before the close of the summer.\r\n\r\nSmith was soon made the leader of the colony, and brought order out of\r\nchaos, made the Indians bring in stores of corn, and had the colony well\r\nsupplied with food for the ensuing winter.\r\n\r\nAfter erecting fortifications Smith began a series of excursions into\r\nthe surrounding region. He proved an excellent leader and became in fact\r\nthe principal head of the colony.\r\n\r\nHe went up the Chickahominy in an open boat. Leaving the craft, he with\r\ntwo others and two Indian guides penetrated the forest, when Smith was\r\nseized by savages under Opechancanough, King of Pumunky, an elder\r\nbrother of Powhatan, and conducted to the presence of the emperor.\r\n\r\nAt a great council presided over by Powhatan, Smith was doomed to die.\r\nMatoa, or Pocahontas, a daughter of Powhatan, begged her father to spare\r\nthe prisoner’s life, but in vain.\r\n\r\nSmith’s head was laid upon two stones, and two warriors had raised heavy\r\nclubs to crush it, when Pocahontas sprang from her father’s side,\r\nclasped Smith’s head with her arms, and laid her own on his.\r\n\r\nThe emperor yielded, and Smith was released and returned to Jamestown,\r\nwhere only forty persons were left, the little church burned to the\r\nground, and the inhabitants on the point of abandoning the settlement.\r\n\r\nOn September 10, 1608, Smith was elected president of the colony; and,\r\nupon assuming this office, he enforced discipline, strove to convert\r\ntheir unthrifty methods, had them rebuild the church, strengthen the\r\ndefenses, and make provision for agriculture and fishery.\r\n\r\nSmith made two voyages, covering hundreds of miles, about the coast of\r\nthe Chesapeake and its tributaries.\r\n\r\nWhen his successor was elected Smith refused to surrender the government\r\nand served until September 29, 1609, when he sailed for England, and\r\nnever again returned to Jamestown.\r\n\r\nThis was unfortunate for the colony, as his better leadership was\r\nnecessary at that time to save it from frequent and serious disturbance.\r\n\r\nIn 1614 he made a voyage of exploration to New England and prepared a\r\nmap of the coast from the Penobscot to Cape Cod.\r\n\r\nWhen Captain Smith sailed his barge up the Chesapeake, entered the\r\nSusquehanna River and pushed as far up that stream as was possible, he\r\nmade the first exploration of that great river from its mouth for\r\nseveral miles, and if he did not actually enter Pennsylvania, he was\r\nvery close and certainly did meet some of the Susquehanna Indians, who\r\nresided in what is now called Lancaster County.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             Washington Started March Through Pennsylvania\r\n                        During Whisky Rebellion,\r\n                           September 30, 1794\r\n\r\n\r\nVirginia claims George Washington as her native son, but most of the\r\ndeeds which made Washington famous and the greater part of both his\r\nmilitary and official life were passed in this State.\r\n\r\nWhile Philadelphia and the counties of the East have stories, legends\r\nand traditions innumerable of the great Father of His Country, while\r\nWestern Pennsylvania was the scene of his early military training,\r\nCentral Pennsylvania, and the Cumberland Valley especially, have also\r\ntheir Washington traditions.\r\n\r\nA Lancaster County almanac, published in the latter part of 1778, is\r\ncredited by many with first having called Washington “Father of His\r\nCountry,” while Lebanon, Hummelstown, Harrisburg, New Cumberland,\r\nCarlisle, Shippensburg, Chambersburg and many other valley towns and\r\nplaces have Washington traditions as part of their historic past,\r\nbecause of Washington’s trip to Bedford during the “Whisky Insurrection”\r\nof 1794.\r\n\r\nA force of 12,900 men was to be raised against the rebellion, and\r\nCarlisle was the rendezvous for the Pennsylvania contingent of 5200.\r\nCumberland County furnished 363 men, including officers. These, with\r\nsimilar quotas from York, Lancaster and Franklin Counties, were under\r\ncommand of Brigadier General James Chambers, of Franklin County.\r\n\r\nThe President set out from his home on Market Street, Philadelphia,\r\nSeptember 30, 1794, accompanied by Secretary Hamilton, his own private\r\nsecretary and a colored servant.\r\n\r\nAccounts of the trip say that Washington was much interested in the\r\ncanals and locks between Myerstown and Lebanon; that he lodged at\r\nLebanon for the night, breakfasted at Hummelstown, the next morning and\r\nreached Harrisburg in time for dinner October 3.\r\n\r\nWashington’s diary mentions the First Regiment of New Jersey, about 560\r\nstrong, which he found drawn up to receive him.\r\n\r\nHe spent the rest of that day in Harrisburg, received an address\r\ndelivered to him by the burgesses[8] in behalf of the citizens, and\r\ndeparted the morning of October 4 for Carlisle, fording the Susquehanna\r\nin his carriage, which he drove himself.\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  Conrad Bombaugh and Alexander Berryhill.\r\n\r\nWashington’s diary says: “On the Cumberland side I found a detachment of\r\nthe Philadelphia Light Horse, ready to receive and escort me to\r\nCarlisle, seventeen miles distant, where I arrived about 11 o’clock.”\r\n\r\nThe President remained seven days in Carlisle, the guest of Colonel\r\nEphraim Blaine. With him, according to one account, were “the members of\r\nhis Cabinet and Governor Mifflin, many Senators and Representatives from\r\nPennsylvania, and those, together with the New Jersey troops, formed a\r\nbrilliant and numerous assemblage.”\r\n\r\nThe day after his arrival General Washington attended public worship.\r\nBefore his departure a number of the principal inhabitants presented him\r\nwith an address.\r\n\r\nSunday morning, October 12, Washington set out from Carlisle on the\r\nWalnut Bottom road. Near what is now Jacksonville stood the residence of\r\nColonel Arthur Buchanan, relative of the later President James Buchanan,\r\na large land owner and proprietor of Pine Grove furnace.\r\n\r\nVerification of Washington having accepted Buchanan’s hospitality, for a\r\nshort time at least, is said to have been founded on the story of\r\n“Polly” Buchanan, a daughter of the host. She died in Shippensburg in\r\n1884 at the age of 104.\r\n\r\nAs Washington and his party came down Shippensburg’s one long street the\r\ncitizens were at their doors. One account says:\r\n\r\n“He was treated with great courtesy and respect by a majority of those\r\nwho came to see him. Yet there were those who sympathized with the\r\ninsurgents and did not join in the general rejoicing. This class, in\r\norder to manifest their disapproval of the employment of the military\r\nforce for suppression of the rebellion, collected secretively a few\r\nnights after the visit of Washington and erected a liberty pole on the\r\ncorner upon which the council house now stands. This was the cause of\r\nmuch ill feeling and many a black eye and bloody nose. The pole was cut\r\ndown at night.”\r\n\r\nAfter dining at Shippensburg the party set out for Chambersburg,\r\nentering that town by the Harper’s Ferry road the same evening. Many of\r\nthe citizens paid their respects to him and the night was spent at\r\nColonel William Morrow’s stone tavern.\r\n\r\nAt daylight on Monday morning, October 13, Washington left Chambersburg.\r\nThe people were at their doors and the President acknowledged their\r\nsalutations as he rode through the streets on horseback, followed by his\r\nblack servant carrying a large portmanteau.\r\n\r\nAfter ten miles’ travel they reached Greencastle. While Washington was\r\nbreakfasting at Robert McCullough’s tavern, Tom McCullough, the\r\nlandlord’s ten-year-old son, who later represented the district in\r\nCongress and became the first president of the Cumberland Valley\r\nRailroad, was discovered under the table. Washington intervened as the\r\ntavern keeper was about to send his son from the room for punishment,\r\nand patted the young fellow on the head.\r\n\r\nLeaving Greencastle, General Washington and his party went on to\r\nBedford, from which place the return journey was started on October 21.\r\n\r\nThe journey of thirty-seven miles to Burnt Cabins is said to have been\r\nthe longest of the entire trip. Leaving there the morning of October 22,\r\nWashington crossed Tuscarora Mountain, passing through Fannetsburg,\r\nwhere earlier a liberty pole had been erected.\r\n\r\nThe feeling of opposition had largely passed away by the time Washington\r\nreached the town. After a hearty welcome, he proceeded to Strasburg and\r\nthen through Pleasant Hill.\r\n\r\nOn the west side of Herron’s Branch Washington and his party halted at a\r\ntavern called the Black Horse. Here Washington inquired if dinner could\r\nbe served the retinue. “We have nothing but an old-fashioned potpie\r\nready, to which you are welcome,” replied the maid. The great general\r\npartook and thus rescued one more hostelry from oblivion.\r\n\r\nFour miles farther he reached Shippensburg again, coming back into the\r\ntown he had left ten days before.\r\n\r\nAfter spending the night at Captain William Ripley’s Black Horse tavern\r\nin Shippensburg, where much entertainment was provided, the President\r\nset out early the next morning and by evening had reached New\r\nCumberland, then called Simpson’s Ferry, in honor of Gen. Michael\r\nSimpson, who as a boy of fifteen had marched with Colonel Bouquet’s\r\nforces.\r\n\r\nWashington spent the night of October 23 with his friend, General\r\nSimpson, and the next day journeyed to York. The next afternoon, it is\r\nsaid, he rode through the rain from York to Wright’s Ferry, now\r\nColumbia, where he remained over night.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, October 26, he proceeded to Lancaster, and on Tuesday October\r\n28, it was noted in Philadelphia that the “President of the United\r\nStates with his suite arrived in Philadelphia from Bedford and resumed\r\nhis duties at the seat of government.”\r\n\r\nCommenting on his trip, Washington wrote to Alexander Hamilton from\r\nWright’s Ferry on Sunday, October 26:\r\n\r\n“Thus far I have proceeded without accident to man, horse or carriage,\r\nalthough the latter has had wherewith to try its goodness, especially in\r\nascending the North Mountain from Skinners by a wrong road, that is, by\r\nthe old road, which never was good, and is rendered next to impassable\r\nby neglect.”\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Sailors Cause of Bloody Election in\r\n                      Philadelphia October 1, 1742\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the early Mayors of Philadelphia was the distinguished Quaker,\r\nIsaac Norris, who had been a member of the Provincial Assembly and the\r\nPresident Judge of the Court of Common Pleas. He had also served as a\r\nmember of the Governor’s Council for more than thirty years, and was\r\nnamed by William Penn in his will as one of the trustees of the\r\nProvince. He died June 4, 1735, and was succeeded by his son of the same\r\nname, known in the history of Pennsylvania as “The Speaker.”\r\n\r\nIsaac Norris, “The Speaker,” married one of the daughters of James\r\nLogan, and soon retired from commercial life. He was a member of the\r\nAssembly for thirty years and for the latter half of that time its\r\nSpeaker.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding his connection with Logan, and the further fact that he\r\nwas a grandson of Hon. Thomas Lloyd, one of the Commissioners of the\r\nProvince from December, 1686, to December, 1688, and Deputy Governor\r\nfrom March, 1691, to April 26, 1693, he was a leader of the strict\r\nFriends in the Assembly who differed in politics from Logan, “who\r\nrepresented the Proprietary, or Governor’s party,” on all questions\r\nrelating to the Province.\r\n\r\nSo persistently did Speaker Norris oppose the Proprietaries in the\r\nvarious disputes between the Governor and the Quakers, or “Norris\r\nParty,” that there resulted such bitter contests for office as would be\r\nfashionable in modern times.\r\n\r\nThe re-election of Norris to the Assembly in 1741 could not be\r\nprevented, and the Quakers gained much ground with Norris in that body,\r\nand with his brother-in-law, Griffiths, and uncle, Preston, who were\r\naldermen of the city of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThe corporation was too important a political factor to submit to his\r\ninfluence and the Proprietary Party succeeded in electing four new\r\naldermen and five new members of the City Council who would further the\r\nGovernor’s plans, but it was no easy matter to defeat Norris at a\r\npopular election.\r\n\r\nIn 1742 a most important session of the Assembly had been held, the\r\nSpeaker was the head of every committee, and he worked indefatigably in\r\nsuperintending the completion of portions of the State House and in\r\npurchasing a site and devising plans for a public pest house or\r\nmunicipal hospital, and in these activities gave some reason to believe\r\nhe could be defeated. The wealthy Recorder of the City, William Allen,\r\ncontended for his seat in the Assembly.\r\n\r\nThen ensued what is since known as “The Bloody Election,” but Norris\r\nproved himself an astute politician and won the support of the German\r\nsettlers, who constituted a large part of the electorate.\r\n\r\nThe Germans had invariably voted with the Quakers, and it was charged\r\nthat the “Norris party” would take possession of the polls, crowd out\r\ntheir opponents, and thus elect their candidate with the aid of\r\nunnaturalized voters.\r\n\r\nThe Governor’s friends cried “fraud” but they were not in possession of\r\nany evidence of it.\r\n\r\nOn October 1, 1742, the day of the “Bloody Election,” a party of\r\nsailors, coopers, and others, strong enough in numbers to make havoc in\r\nthe little city, marched uptown from the wharves, armed with clubs, and,\r\nwhen they arrived at the Court House, a fight took place in which\r\nseveral were wounded, and the disciples of peace and order were driven\r\nfrom the historic building.\r\n\r\nThe affair made a great stir, and is well perpetuated in the caricatures\r\nmade at the time which were drawn with the intention to traduce and\r\nstigmatize the political leaders in those days.\r\n\r\nIn the appendix to the “Votes of the Assembly” is published the\r\ninteresting testimony relating to this “Bloody Election.”\r\n\r\nThe witnesses were “examined in a solemn manner,” and it appeared that\r\nsome fifty to seventy sailors, armed with clubs, made their appearance\r\nat the Court House, at Second and High Streets, in support of the\r\nProprietary Party.\r\n\r\nWilliam Till, Mayor of the city, was called upon to interfere against\r\nthe sailors, but he declined to do so, saying, as was testified: “They\r\nhad as much right at the election as the Dutchmen.”\r\n\r\nIt appears by the statement of the time, that a wagonload of hop-poles,\r\neasy to cut into clubs, made its appearance at a point so convenient\r\nthat the other party availed itself of the boon.\r\n\r\nAmong the witnesses, Robert Hopkins testified that, “when the sailors\r\nwere moving off, and came by William Allen one among them being a squat\r\nfull-faced, pock-fretten man, with a light wig and red breeches, as he\r\nsupposes, said, 'Let’s give Mr. Allen a whorrah! And said Allen reply’d:\r\n'Ye villians begone: I'll have nothing to do with you'.”\r\n\r\nAfter this we are not surprised at that staunch Friend, Israel\r\nPemberton, the last witness examined, being able to testify that upward\r\nof fifty sailors were arrested and secured in prison, “and then,” he\r\ngoes on to say, “the Freeholders proceeded to the choice of the\r\nRepresentatives to serve in the Assembly, and the other officers, which\r\nwas carried on very peaceably the remainder of the day.”\r\n\r\nA petition was read in the Provincial Council, November 5, 1742, which\r\nwas addressed to Lieutenant Governor George Thomas, and among other\r\nstatements the petitioners stated that the rioters attacked the\r\nconstables and broke their staves and beat them up and grievously\r\nwounded divers citizens, among whom was one of the Aldermen.\r\n\r\nThey claimed many were knocked down with stones without regard to age or\r\nstation. Sure enough a bloody election; especially must it have seemed\r\nso to the staid Quakers of the City of Brotherly Love.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1759, Speaker Isaac Norris resolved to relinquish his\r\npublic duties and declined a re-election which was sure to be in his\r\nfavor. He made his announcement in the House, and among other things\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“You were pleased to make choice of me to succeed my father in the\r\nAssembly at the election of the year, 1735. I never sought emolument for\r\nmyself or family, and I remained at disadvantage to my private interest\r\nonly to oppose the measures of unreasonable men. No man shall ever stamp\r\nhis foot on my grave and say, Curse him! or Here lies he who so basely\r\nbetrayed the liberties of his country.”\r\n\r\nA true patriot in motive surely.\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded as speaker by Benjamin Franklin.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Massacre in Vicinity of Patterson’s\r\n                         Fort, October 2, 1755\r\n\r\n\r\nOn October 2, 1755, the savages suddenly appeared in Tuscarora Valley,\r\nin the vicinity of Patterson’s Fort, on the north side of the Mahantango\r\nCreek, in Snyder County, and killed and captured forty persons.\r\n\r\nThis fort was situated immediately beyond the dividing line of Juniata\r\nand Snyder Counties, and in the vicinity of Pomfret Castle, which seems\r\nto be often mistaken for Fort Patterson.\r\n\r\nThere were two Fort Pattersons and two Captain Pattersons, which has\r\nalso caused much confusion. The two captains were father and son, and\r\ntheir places near each other, and both stockaded, although Captain\r\nWilliam Patterson’s fort was not built until 1763.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Franklin gave the following directions to George Croghan in a\r\nletter dated December 17, 1755: “You are desired to proceed to\r\nCumberland County and fix on proper places for erecting three stockades;\r\nnamely, one back of Patterson’s—each of them fifty feet square, with a\r\nblockhouse on two of the corners and a barracks within, capable of\r\nlodging fifty men.”\r\n\r\nThe one “back of Patterson’s” was to be on the Mahantango Creek, where\r\nRichfield, Snyder County, now is situated, and was to be built by\r\nColonel James Burd and Captain James Patterson.\r\n\r\nCaptain James Patterson commanded a company of rangers in Braddock’s\r\ncampaign, under Colonel James Burd, and assisted in cutting the way\r\nthrough the forests.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1751 James Patterson, with five or six other settlers,\r\nsettled in the Juniata Valley at the present town of Mexico.\r\n\r\nPatterson cleared his land, engaged in farming and erected a large and\r\nstrong log house, which afterward became known as Fort Patterson. It\r\nbecame the haven of refuge and defense for the settlers in the attack\r\nmade upon them by the Indians.\r\n\r\nPatterson was a man of daring and considered by the Indians to be a\r\ncrack marksman. Whenever Indians appeared at his plantation he delighted\r\nto shoot at a mark, when his unerring aim impressed his visitors that he\r\nwould be a dangerous foe.\r\n\r\nHis son, William, was called to Fort Augusta for the purpose of getting\r\ninstructions to settle difficulties on the path through the valley.\r\nWhile on this mission he fell in with some Indians at Middle Creek, one\r\nof whom was killed and scalped and the rest put to flight.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Patterson’s men was wounded. He advised the commander of\r\nFort Augusta that the woods were full of Indians; that they found many\r\nhouses burned, some still burning, and that he feared all the grain\r\nwould be destroyed by the savages, who are known to be Delaware.\r\n\r\nFort Patterson was attacked at this time and one Hugh Mitcheltree\r\ncarried off.\r\n\r\nOctober 5, 1755, the savages made an incursion near Fort Patterson.\r\nJennie McClain, a young girl, mounted a horse and hurriedly fled toward\r\nthe fort, when, but a short distance from it, an Indian shot the horse\r\nthrough the body, when Jennie fell off the horse and was captured. The\r\nIndians surrounded the fort, but the Pattersons defended it so bravely\r\nthat the savages were driven off.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1756 Captain Patterson marched to Shamokin (now\r\nSunbury) with Colonel Clapham’s “Augusta Regiment” and assisted in\r\nbuilding and defending that fort.\r\n\r\nIn 1757 Captain Patterson was detailed and placed in command of Fort\r\nHunter, above Harrisburg, and at this post he was constantly occupied in\r\nsending out ranging parties, and had charge of the bateau men who\r\ntransported provisions from Harris’ Ferry to Fort Augusta.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1758, Captain Patterson left Fort Augusta on the march to\r\nRaystown (Fort Bedford), where he joined in the Forbes expedition\r\nagainst Fort Duquesne. After the Indians were finally subdued Captain\r\nPatterson returned to his plantation and followed farming.\r\n\r\nWhen the Indians again became violent in Pontiac’s War in 1763, Captain\r\nPatterson and his son, William, then a lieutenant, were again on guard.\r\n\r\nCaptain James Patterson died at his fort and is buried near it.\r\n\r\nWilliam, son of Captain James, was born in Donegal Township, Lancaster\r\nCounty, in 1737, and went with his father to the Juniata in 1751. Like\r\nhis brave father, William was a keen marksman and a most daring and\r\nvaluable aid to his father. He was with his father’s company, which was\r\npart of Braddock’s army. Later he was an ensign at Fort Augusta.\r\n\r\nFor many months he and his father, with details of privates, ranged the\r\nmountains and streams in search of Indians.\r\n\r\nWilliam Patterson not only displayed great capacity as a partisan\r\nsoldier, but was equally conspicuous in civil life. He marched in\r\nadvance of General Forbes’ army to Fort Duquesne in 1758. He also served\r\nunder Colonel Burd in conveying livestock and subsistence from Fort\r\nCumberland to Fort Burd and Fort Pitt in 1759.\r\n\r\nAfter his return from the army Captain Patterson seems to have devoted\r\nhis time to land surveying. His fine presence and dashing character won\r\nthe admiration and esteem of the pioneer settlers, especially of the\r\nyoung men, who followed the chase and provided game for the large and\r\ngrowing settlements in Tuscarora Valley and around Patterson’s Fort.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Pontiac War, as late as 1767, when fort after fort were\r\ndestroyed and the feeble garrison put to the hatchet, Captain William\r\nPatterson called his young hunters and defied the Indians.\r\n\r\nPontiac had boasted that no wooden fort or stockade could escape\r\ndestruction if he desired to destroy them.\r\n\r\nWhen they could induce the garrison by cunning and lying to surrender,\r\nthey would load a wagon with straw and hay and set it on fire and back\r\nit against the timbers and let the demon fire to do the work.\r\n\r\nAlthough Patterson’s Fort was surrounded by savages repeatedly, they\r\nwere driven away and kept at a safe distance by the expert riflemen\r\nunder the command of Captain Patterson.\r\n\r\nWilliam Patterson, in 1768, arrested and safely lodged in the jail at\r\nCarlisle Frederick Stump and his accomplice John Ironcutter for\r\ncommitting an unprovoked massacre, the victims being Indians. This\r\naction required the greatest heroism.\r\n\r\nThe Governor of the Province of Pennsylvania at that period was so\r\nhighly pleased with the prompt action of Captain Patterson that he gave\r\nhim a commission as Judge of the Common Pleas Court of Cumberland\r\nCounty. He also was appointed a Commissioner to lay out Northumberland\r\nCounty in March, 1772.\r\n\r\nCaptain William Patterson is described in the Shippen papers as “a\r\ngentleman of limited education, a very good soldier and does his duty\r\nwell.” He is often mentioned in Colonel Burd’s journal.\r\n\r\nA fine bronze tablet mounted on a large boulder recently has been\r\nunveiled at the site of Fort Patterson, which will mark for this and\r\nfuture generations the spot made famous by the progenitors of this great\r\nPatterson family in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Washington Joins Troops in Whisky\r\n                      Insurrection October 3, 1794\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 1794 is distinguished in American history by a remarkable\r\nrevolt among a portion of the inhabitants of Pennsylvania, known as the\r\nWhisky Insurrection.\r\n\r\nIn 1791 Congress enacted a law laying excise duties upon spirits\r\ndistilled within the United States. This tax excited general opposition,\r\nbut nowhere else was such violence exhibited in resisting the execution\r\nof the law as in the western counties of Pennsylvania, where the crops\r\nof grain were so over-abundant that, in the absence of adequate market\r\nfor its sale, an immense quantity of the cereals was distilled into\r\nwhisky, the far-famed “Monongahela,” called from the name of the\r\nprincipal river in that region.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants insisted that an article, produced almost exclusively by\r\nan isolated people as their sole and necessary support, ought not to be\r\ntaxed for the support of the Federal Government, and to this opinion\r\nthey adhered with a tenacity worthy of a better cause.\r\n\r\nPublic meetings were held in all the chief towns, at which the action of\r\nCongress was loudly denounced as oppression to be battled against to the\r\nvery last extremity; declaring, too, that any person who had accepted or\r\nmight accept an office under the Government in order to carry the law\r\ninto effect should be regarded as an enemy of his country, to be treated\r\nwith contempt and officially and personally shunned.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Government was scoffed at, its coercive authority ridiculed,\r\nand with the motto, “Liberty and No Excise!” the ball of the rebellion\r\nrolled on.\r\n\r\nOne day preceding the assembling of an important meeting of malcontents\r\nin Pittsburgh, the tax collector for the counties of Allegheny and\r\nWashington made his appearance. Aware of his business, a party of men,\r\narmed and disguised, waylaid him at a place on Pigeon Creek, in\r\nWashington County, seized, tarred and feathered him, cut off his hair\r\nand deprived him of his horse, obliging him to decamp on foot in that\r\npainful condition.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to serve legal processes upon the perpetrators of this\r\noutrage, the marshal’s deputy was also seized, whipped, tarred and\r\nfeathered; and, after having his money taken from him, he was\r\nblindfolded and led into the depths of the forest, where he was tied to\r\na sapling and left to his fate. He was fortunately discovered and\r\nrescued by friends.\r\n\r\nAnother man was similarly handled who remarked that they could not\r\nreasonably expect protection from a Government whose laws they so\r\nstrenuously opposed. Two witnesses of this assault were seized by an\r\narmed banditti and carried off so they could not give testimony against\r\nthe perpetrators of the assault.\r\n\r\nPresident Washington feared such open defiance of the laws, and issued a\r\nproclamation condemning the lawless acts and warned all to return at\r\nonce to their allegiance. Bills of indictment were found against the\r\nleaders of some of the outrages, and, at the same time, process was also\r\nissued against a great number of noncomplying distillers.\r\n\r\nThe proclamation and warning did not produce the desired effect.\r\nWashington then ordered the seizure of the spirits distilled in the\r\ncounties opposing the law.\r\n\r\nContractors for the army were forbidden to purchase spirits on which\r\nduties had not been paid. The distillers were caught between two\r\nmillstones. They feared the wrath of the infuriated populace if they\r\npaid the excise tax or lost their best customers.\r\n\r\nThe factionists were encouraged by the leniency of the Executive. By\r\nviolent threats they kept the marshal from serving precepts, committed\r\nnumerous outrages upon the friends of the Government and perfected their\r\norganization into military bands, to resist any force that might be sent\r\nto subject them to the laws. They styled their acts, “mending the\r\nstill.”\r\n\r\nIt is not to be doubted that this inflamed state of the public mind was\r\ngreatly aggravated by the ambitious designs and intemperate speeches of\r\na few leading men. Conspicuous among the malcontents were David\r\nBradford, Colonel John Marshall, Robert Smiley, Hugh Brackenridge,\r\nWilliam Findley and Albert Gallatin. The first named was the chief\r\nagitator.\r\n\r\nHostilities broke out early in 1794, when those who paid the excise tax\r\nwere punished as well as those who attempted to collect the tax. Even\r\nthe Government officials were attacked by armed men.\r\n\r\nGeneral John Neville, inspector for the county, was compelled to defend\r\nhis home by force of arms, and Major Abraham Kirkpatrick, with a detail\r\nof eleven soldiers, was compelled to surrender to a mob, under the\r\nleadership of a desperado named John Holcroft.\r\n\r\nAfter brisk fighting continued for nearly an hour, the insurgents set\r\nfire to eight buildings, which finally compelled brave Kirkpatrick to\r\nyield.\r\n\r\nDavid Bradford assembled meetings to ascertain their secret enemies as\r\nwell as to learn their own strength. Mail was searched and the\r\nGovernment stores attacked. There was even a plan developed which had\r\nthe capture of Fort Pitt and the United States Arsenal at Pittsburgh as\r\nits objectives.\r\n\r\nThe greatest popular demonstration was at Parkinson’s Ferry, where\r\n16,000 men were pledged to follow the leadership of Bradford.\r\n\r\nPresident Washington called a cabinet meeting and had General Thomas\r\nMifflin, Governor of Pennsylvania, in attendance. Commissioners were\r\nsent to apprise the insurgents of their grave danger.\r\n\r\nA proclamation was broadcast August 7, which warned of the impending\r\nwar, if all did not quietly return to their home by September 1.\r\n\r\nThe same day of the proclamation a requisition was made on the Governor\r\nof New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania for their several\r\nquotas of militia.\r\n\r\nDuring the recruiting of this force Judge Jasper Yeates, James Ross and\r\nWilliam Bradford were sent as commissioners to the western counties to\r\nextinguish the insurrection.\r\n\r\nDavid Bradford laughed at the proclamations of the President and\r\nGovernors of New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania for the\r\nCommittee of Safety was held at Parkinson’s Ferry and appointed\r\ncommissioners to wait upon his Excellency and assure him that submission\r\nand order could be restored without the aid of military force.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the troops responded to the call, and, in response to a\r\nsecond proclamation of President Washington, they rendezvoued at\r\nBedford, Pa., and Cumberland, Md. The command of the entire army was\r\ngiven to General Henry Lee, of Virginia. Governor Mifflin took command\r\nof the Pennsylvania troops in person.\r\n\r\nThe President departed for the front in a drenching rain. He arrived at\r\nHarrisburg Friday, October 3. The same day a meeting of the Committee of\r\nSafety was held at Parkinson’s Ferry and appointed commissioners to wait\r\nupon his Excellency and assure him that submission and order could be\r\nrestored without the aid of military force.\r\n\r\nThe insurgents by this time had come to their senses, and intimidated by\r\nthe greatness of the force, fled in every direction. Those arrested were\r\npardoned. Bradford escaped to Spanish territory. The Whisky Insurrection\r\ncame to an end. As Washington said, “the contest decided that a small\r\nportion of the United States could not dictate to the whole Union.”\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Americans Defeated in Battle of Germantown,\r\n                            October 4, 1777\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Battle of Germantown was one of the most spirited actions of the\r\nRevolution. It was a contest for the possession of a widely extended and\r\nstrongly posted line, between the two armies, and at a time when the\r\nBritish had but a week earlier invested Philadelphia, driving the\r\nContinental Congress to Lancaster.\r\n\r\nHowe’s army had crossed the Schuylkill, and was encamped near\r\nGermantown.\r\n\r\nWashington was at Pennypacker’s Mill, between the Perkiomen and the\r\nSkippack Creeks, thirty miles from the city, where he awaited\r\nre-enforcements from the Northern Department. His army, which was mainly\r\ncomposed of Continental troops from Pennsylvania, Maryland and New\r\nJersey, had suffered severe punishment at Brandywine and Paoli. It was\r\npoorly equipped and poorly fed.\r\n\r\nWashington learned, through two intercepted letters, that General Howe\r\nhad detached a part of his force to reduce Billingsport and the forts on\r\nthe Delaware.\r\n\r\nHe believed that a favorable opportunity was offered to make an attack\r\nupon the troops which were encamped at Germantown, and fixed the attack\r\nfor the morning of October 4, 1777.\r\n\r\nGeneral Howe’s army was encamped upon the general line of School and\r\nChurch lanes.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d General Washington advanced his army to Worcester Township.\r\nThe British did not expect an attack as General Howe fully understood\r\nthe drubbing the Americans had recently received, but he did not know\r\nthe fighting temper of the Colonists.\r\n\r\nWashington was well informed of the enemy’s position and prepared his\r\norder of battle with great care. The divisions of Sullivan and Wayne,\r\nflanked by Conway’s Brigade, were to enter the town by way of Chestnut\r\nHill.\r\n\r\nGeneral Armstrong, with the Pennsylvania Militia, was to go down\r\nManatawny road and get in the enemy’s left and rear. The divisions of\r\nGreene and Stephen, flanked by McDougall’s Brigade, were to enter by a\r\ncircuitous route at the Market House, and attack the right wing, and the\r\nmilitia of Maryland and New Jersey, under Generals Smallwood and Forman,\r\nwere to march by the Old York road and fall upon the rear of their\r\nright. Lord Stirling, and Nash’s and Maxwell’s brigades were to form the\r\nreserve.\r\n\r\nGeneral McDougall was to attack the right wing of the enemy in front and\r\nrear; General Conway to attack the enemy’s left flank, and General\r\nArmstrong to attack their left wing in flank and rear.\r\n\r\nEach column was to move into position, two miles from the enemy’s\r\npickets by 2 o’clock, then halt until 4, and advance and attack the\r\npickets precisely at 5 o’clock, “with charge bayonets and without\r\nfiring, and the column to move to the attack as soon as possible.”\r\n\r\nOn the evening of October 3 the army left its encampment on Metuchen\r\nHills. It was a hard march through the darkness, over rough roads and in\r\na dense fog.\r\n\r\nWhen the action opened the Americans soon gained much ground and General\r\nHowe, who had hurried to the front, met his troop retreating. He quickly\r\ngalloped back to camp and prepared for the attack. Sullivan and Wayne\r\npressed forward, and Washington followed with the reserve.\r\n\r\nWhile the advance was in progress, General Greene had made the circuit\r\nof the Limekiln road, and engaged the enemy’s right. The incompetent\r\nGeneral Stephens became entangled with Wayne’s troops, which confusion\r\nended the efforts of General Sullivan’s columns upon the east side of\r\nthe town.\r\n\r\nGeneral Greene continued to advance, maintaining a line of battle as\r\nlong as practicable. McDougall was marching over ground so nearly\r\nimpassable that he was quite out of the action and failed to assist\r\nGreene, leaving his flank exposed.\r\n\r\nThe morning was well advanced when the two wings of the army had\r\napproached the central objective point, the Market House. But the lines\r\nwere broken and disordered, by the innumerable obstacles and by the\r\nimpenetrable fog, that the British had opportunity to reform their own\r\nshattered line. Howe sent strong forces to oppose each attack.\r\n\r\nWhen Sullivan’s division had pushed forward nearly to School Lane, while\r\nGreene was entering the town on the east, these generals found\r\nthemselves unsupported by other troops, their cartridges expended, the\r\nforce of the enemy on the right collecting to oppose them, and seeing\r\nmany of the American troops flying in retreat, they retired with all\r\npossible haste.\r\n\r\nWhen General Grey came from his camp at School Lane and advanced to the\r\nattack, the few Americans there could not resist him, and were soon\r\nrepulsed. Grey advanced across lots and pushed on toward the Chew house.\r\n\r\nGeneral Agnew, following in the rear of Grey, ascended the hill and\r\nreceived a sudden volley from a party of citizens who were concealed\r\nbehind the Mennonite meeting house and he fell mortally wounded.\r\n\r\nWayne’s division on the east of the town had already withdrawn when\r\nGeneral Grant moved up his Forty-ninth British regiment.\r\n\r\nGeneral Washington, who had remained at the head of the hill above\r\nChew’s house, saw the failure of his well-laid plans, and issued orders\r\nfor the retreat.\r\n\r\nThe American army had gone forward to gain full possession of the\r\nenemy’s camp, which was on fire in many places. Dead and wounded were\r\nstrewn about everywhere. The troops were in much disorder. Those in\r\nfront had been driven back by the enemy and fell upon those in the rear,\r\nwhich increased the confusion and rendered it impossible to again form\r\nand oppose an advancing foe.\r\n\r\nA general retreat was inevitably necessary to save the American army\r\nfrom a general rout.\r\n\r\nLord Cornwallis, who was in Philadelphia, learned of the attack and put\r\nin motion two battalions of British and one Hessian grenadiers, with a\r\nsquadron of dragoons, to Howe’s support.\r\n\r\nThey arrived at Germantown just as the Americans were being forced from\r\nthe village. Cornwallis joined with General Grey, and, placing himself\r\nin command, took up pursuit.\r\n\r\nGeneral Greene effected the withdrawal of his forces with considerable\r\ndifficulty and no slight loss, as Colonel Matthew’s gallant regiment, or\r\nwhat remained of it, fell into the enemy’s hands, its heroic commander\r\nand many of his officers being severely wounded by the enemy’s bayonets.\r\n\r\nGeneral Greene also had much trouble in saving his cannon, when Count\r\nPulaski’s cavalry being hard-driven by the pursuing British, rode into\r\nand scattered Greene’s division.\r\n\r\nFor two hours and forty minutes the battle waged at the very doors of\r\nthe inhabitants of Germantown, in their gardens, orchards and fields.\r\n\r\nThe entire loss sustained by two armies was never accurately determined.\r\n\r\nThe British did not gain much satisfaction in their victory for they\r\nsoon abandoned their well-earned fields, and moved within the\r\nentrenchments directly north of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Riotous Mob Attacks “Fort Wilson” in\r\n                     Philadelphia, October 5, 1779\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1779 the lives of Mr. James Wilson, the signer of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, and one of the foremost practitioners of\r\nthat day, and many of his friends, were put in extreme hazard by a band\r\nof frenzied partisans, under the pretext of his holding sentiments\r\ninimical to popular institutions.\r\n\r\nAt that time party spirit in Pennsylvania had taken definite shape, and\r\nthe politicians were divided into Constitutionalists and Republicans.\r\nThe former rallied around the Constitution of 1776, recently formed,\r\nwhich was reprobated by the Republicans, who believed it tended toward\r\nrash, precipitate and oppressive proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe term Republicans was embraced, as recognizing the principles of the\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson was among the leading men of the Republican Party who had\r\nagreed that they would not accept of any office or appointment under the\r\nConstitution, which, in that case, they would be bound by oath, to\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nThis circumstance offended and inflamed the Constitutional Party, and as\r\nMr. Wilson had become counsel for the defense of some suspected\r\ntraitors, and had succeeded in winning their acquittal, it angered the\r\nmilitiamen of Philadelphia and led to a most serious outrage.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of a rapidly depreciating currency were distressing to\r\nmany who were incapable of tracing them to their causes. For example,\r\nevery tradesman who had engaged in a piece of work felt, when paid for\r\nit, that he did not receive, except in name, the amount he had\r\ncontracted to receive.\r\n\r\nArtful and designing incendiaries persuaded many of the sufferers that\r\nthe evil was owing to the merchants, who monopolized the goods, and to\r\ncertain lawyers who rescued the tories from punishment, by pleading for\r\nthem in Court.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson had become particularly obnoxious. He was in fact a most\r\ndecided friend of the popular government. He was a native of Scotland,\r\nand a Presbyterian, which should certainly stamp him as a friend of\r\nthose opposed to the British authority.\r\n\r\nThe affair of “Fort Wilson,” as his house was thereafter known, flowed\r\nfrom this mistaken opinion, of which those who concocted the disgraceful\r\ntransaction took advantage for party purposes.\r\n\r\nSeptember 13, 1779, a committee appointed at a town meeting, regulated\r\nthe prices of rum, salt, sugar, coffee, flour, etc., a measure which was\r\nstrongly opposed by the importers.\r\n\r\nRobert Morris, Blair McClenochan and John Willcocks and a number of\r\nstanch Whigs had a quantity of these articles in their stores which they\r\nrefused to dispose of at the regulated prices.\r\n\r\nAbout the last of the month, a great number of the lower class collected\r\nand marched through the streets, threatening to break open the stores,\r\ndistribute the goods and punish those who refused to open their\r\nwarehouses.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of October 4, placards were posted menacing Robert\r\nMorris, Blair McClenochan and many other merchants.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson was proscribed by the mob for having exercised his\r\nprofessional duty as a lawyer, and the punishment decreed for his crime\r\nwas banishment to the enemy, yet in New York. But this was not the real\r\ncause which produced so lamentable an instance of popular delusion. That\r\nwas to be found in the superior talents and respectability of the\r\nRepublican Party.\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen threatened determined to defend themselves, and with a\r\ngreat number of their friends, to the amount of thirty or forty, took\r\npost at the southwest corner of Walnut and Third streets, in a house\r\nbelonging to and occupied by James Wilson. It was a large old-fashioned\r\nbrick building, with extensive gardens.\r\n\r\nIn the house were James Wilson, Robert Morris, Edward Burd, George\r\nClymer, John T. Mifflin, Allen McLane, Sharp Delaney, George Campbell,\r\nPaul Beck, Thomas Lawrence, Andrew Robinson, John Potts, Samuel C.\r\nMorris, Captain Robert Campbell, General Thomas Mifflin, General Nichols\r\nand General Thompson. They were provided with arms but their supply of\r\nammunition was very limited.\r\n\r\nWhile the mob was marching down town, General Nichols and Daniel Clymer\r\nproceeded hastily to the arsenal at Carpenters’ Hall and filled their\r\npockets with cartridges, this constituting their entire supply.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the mob and militia assembled on the commons, while a\r\nmeeting of the principal citizens took place at the coffee house. A\r\ndeputation was sent to prevail on them to disperse, but without effect.\r\n\r\nThe First Troop of City Cavalry being apprised of what was going forward\r\nand anxious for the safety of their fellow citizens, quickly assembled\r\nat their stables, a fixed place of rendezvous.\r\n\r\nFor a time a deceitful calm prevailed; at the hour of noon the members\r\nof the troop retired to their respective homes for dinner, and the\r\nrebels seized the opportunity to march into the city.\r\n\r\nThe armed men in the mob amounted to 200, and were commanded by Captain\r\nMills, a North Carolinian; one Falkner, a shipjoiner; Pickering, a\r\ntailor, and John Bonham. They marched to the home of Mr. Wilson, with\r\ndrums beating, and two pieces of cannon. They immediately commenced\r\nfiring on the house, which was warmly returned by the garrison.\r\n\r\nFinding they could make no impression, the mob procured crowbars,\r\nsledges and bars, and with them proceeded to force the door. At the\r\ncritical moment when the door yielded to their efforts, the First City\r\nTroop appeared and saved the lives of those in the house.\r\n\r\nMany of the mob were arrested and committed to prison, and as the\r\ntroopers used the sword very freely, many were severely wounded. One man\r\nand one boy were killed in the streets. In “Fort Wilson,” Captain\r\nCampbell was killed, and General Mifflin and Mr. Samuel C. Morris were\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\nThe Troop patrolled the streets the greater part of the night. The\r\ncitizens turned out in great numbers and formed a volunteer guard at the\r\npowder magazine and the arsenal.\r\n\r\nIt was some days before order was restored and the First Troop, on\r\naccount of the active part they had taken in the affair, found it\r\nnecessary to keep together in small groups, and be on the alert to\r\nsupport each other.\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen who had comprised the garrison were advised to leave the\r\ncity where their lives were endangered.\r\n\r\nGeneral Mifflin, and about thirty others, accordingly met at Mr. Gray’s\r\nhome about five miles below Gray’s Ferry, where a council was called,\r\nand it was resolved to return to town without any appearance of\r\nintimidation.\r\n\r\nBut it was deemed expedient that Mr. Wilson should absent himself for a\r\ntime. The others continued to walk as usual in public and attended the\r\nfuneral of the unfortunate Captain Campbell. For some time each of them,\r\nhowever, was in danger of his life from the sympathizers with the killed\r\nand wounded assailants.\r\n\r\nThus ended the disgraceful affair known as the “Mob of 1779” and the\r\n“Attack on Fort Wilson.”\r\n\r\nHad it not been for the spirited conduct of the First Troop, the lives\r\nof many valuable citizens, and genuine Whigs, would have been\r\nsacrificed, and an indelible disgrace entailed upon the City of\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               First German Immigrants Settle Germantown\r\n                            October 6, 1683\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Germans have played a most important part in the history of\r\nPennsylvania, much more conspicuous than has been accorded them. They\r\nare the progressive farmers, and leaders in politics, literature and\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nThe first great teacher was Pastorius; the first paper mill was\r\nestablished in 1690, on a branch of Wissahickon Creek, by William\r\nRittinghuysen; the Bible was first printed in German, by Christopher\r\nSaur, thirty-nine years before it appeared in English; the same\r\nenterprising Germans, in 1735, established the first type foundry in\r\nAmerica in Germantown and so on, but it is of the establishment of\r\nGerman Town or Germantown which this story is to relate.\r\n\r\nThe first German emigration was from Crefeld, a city of the lower Rhine.\r\nWilliam Penn conveyed 5000 acres in Pennsylvania to each of three\r\nmerchants of that city, March 10, 1682, one of whom, Jacob Telner, had\r\nmade a trip to America in 1678–81.\r\n\r\nFrancis Daniel Pastorius first heard of the Pennsylvania plan in 1682,\r\nand became a purchaser of land while in London between the 8th of May\r\nand 6th of June, 1683.\r\n\r\nEight original purchasers, November 12, 1686, formed themselves into a\r\ncompany which was called the Frankford Company. Up to June 8, 1683,\r\nthese persons had purchased 15,000 acres, and they mostly lived in\r\nFrankfort, but Pastorius was the only one of the original company who\r\never came to Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThirteen families, comprising thirty-three persons, set out for London,\r\nfrom which city, after many delays, they embarked, July 24, 1683, aboard\r\nthe Concord.\r\n\r\nOf the original purchasers three were Mennonites, and many of the\r\nremainder of the party belonged to that sect, so it must be stated that\r\nthis emigration was also the beginning of that great church in America.\r\n\r\nThe pioneers had a pleasant voyage and reached Philadelphia October 6.\r\nOn the 10th of the same month a warrant was issued to Pastorius for 6000\r\nacres “on behalf of the German and Dutch purchasers.” On the 24th,\r\nThomas Fairman measured off fourteen divisions of land, and the next\r\nday, meeting together in the cave of Pastorius they drew lots for choice\r\nof location.\r\n\r\nUnder a warrant, 5350 acres were laid out, May 2, 1684, for Pastorius,\r\nas trustee for them and future purchasers; in addition 200 acres were\r\nlaid out for Pastorius in his own right, and 150 acres to Jurian\r\nHartsfelder, a stray Dutchman, who had been a deputy sheriff under\r\nAndros in 1676 and who now cast in his lot with the settlers at\r\nGermantown.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the division in the cave of Pastorius they began to\r\ndig cellars and build the huts in which, not without much hardship, they\r\nspent the following winter. Thus commenced the settlement of Germantown.\r\n\r\nOther emigrants began to appear in the little town, and soon we catch a\r\nglimpse of the home life of the early dwellers of Germantown.\r\n\r\nPastorius had no glass, so he made windows of oiled paper.\r\n\r\nBom wrote to Rotterdam October 12, 1684: “I have here a shop of many\r\nkinds of goods and edibles. Sometimes I ride out with merchandise, and\r\nsometimes, bring something back, mostly from Indians, and deal with them\r\nin many things. I have no regular servants except one Negro, whom I\r\nbought. I have no rent or tax or excise to pay. I have a cow which gives\r\nplenty of milk, a horse to ride around, my pigs increase rapidly, so\r\nthat in the summer I had seventeen when at first I had only two. I have\r\nmany chickens and geese, and a garden, and shall next year have an\r\norchard if I remain well, so that my wife and I are in good spirits.”\r\n\r\nBom died before 1689, and his daughter, Agnes, married Anthony Morris,\r\nthe ancestor of the distinguished family of that name.\r\n\r\nThe first person to die in the new settlement was Jan Seimens. The first\r\ntime that fire caused a loss in the village was in 1686. A small church\r\nwas built that year. It is strange but true, that this was a Quaker\r\nmeeting house, and also that before 1692 all the original thirteen,\r\nexcept Jan Lensen, had in one way or another been associated with the\r\nQuakers.\r\n\r\nAn event of importance was the arrival of William Rittinghuysen, a\r\nMennonite minister, who with his two sons, Gerhard and Claus, and a\r\ndaughter, came from Holland. In 1690 he built the first paper mill in\r\nAmerica on a branch of the Wissahickon Creek.\r\n\r\nOn April 18, 1688, Gerhard Hendricks, Dirck Opden Graeff, Francis Daniel\r\nPastorius and Abraham Opden Graeff sent to the Friends’ Meeting the\r\nfirst public protest ever made on this continent against the holding of\r\nslaves. There was then started something which became the greatest\r\nquestion of all time in America.\r\n\r\nOn January 14, 1690, 2950 acres, north of Germantown, were divided into\r\nthree districts, called Krishelm, Sommerhausen and Crefeld.\r\n\r\nThe village had now become populous enough to warrant a separate\r\nexistence, and on May 31, 1691, a charter of incorporation was issued to\r\nFrancis Daniel Pastorius, bailiff, and four burgesses and six\r\ncommitteemen, with power to hold a court and a market, to admit\r\ncitizens, to impose fines, and to make ordinances.\r\n\r\nIt was ordered that “on the 19th of one month in each year the people\r\nshall be called together and the laws and ordinances read aloud to\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\nThe seal was devised by Pastorius and he honored the weavers by\r\nselecting a clover, on one of the leaves being a vine, on another a\r\nstalk of flax, and on the third a weaver’s spool.\r\n\r\nThe corporation continued until January 11, 1707. Newcomers were\r\nrequired to pay £1 for the right of citizenship.\r\n\r\nOn June 28, 1701, a tax was laid for the building of a prison, erection\r\nof a market, and other objects for the public good. The prison preceded\r\nthe school house, but the interval was not long.\r\n\r\nDecember 30, following, “it was found good to start a school here in\r\nGermantown.” Pastorius was the first pedagogue.\r\n\r\nAs early as January 25, 1694, stocks were erected for the punishment of\r\nevildoers.\r\n\r\nFebruary 10, 1702, three square perches of land were given to the\r\nMennonites for a church, which edifice was built 1708.\r\n\r\nLittle did the industrious German of that day think, as he tilled the\r\nsoil, or worked at his trade, that in after years the countrymen of Penn\r\nwould be fighting the Quakers and others in that very town, that the\r\nstreets of Germantown would be reddened by English blood, as it was on\r\nthat eventful day, October 4, 1777.\r\n\r\nThe government of Germantown lasted fifteen years. Today this old town\r\nis one of the most delightful sections of the old city of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             Colonel Richard McAllister, Soldier, Statesman\r\n                      and Citizen of York County,\r\n                          Died October 7, 1795\r\n\r\n\r\nColonel Richard McAllister, a hero of the Revolution, died at his home\r\nin Hanover, York County, October 7, 1795.\r\n\r\nDuring that great struggle for the independence of the colonies York\r\nCounty gave many of her loyal sons, and none rendered more signal\r\nservice or has been held in fonder patriotic reverence than Colonel\r\nMcAllister.\r\n\r\nHe was the son of Archibald McAllister, who came to this country from\r\nScotland in 1732. Richard was born in Scotland in 1724.\r\n\r\nAbout 1745 Richard moved from Cumberland County to the present site of\r\nHanover, where he purchased a large tract of land, and made a\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nOn February 23, 1748, he married Mary Dill, daughter of Colonel Matthew\r\nDill, who commanded a regiment in the French and Indian War, and whose\r\nson, Matthew, founded Dillsburg.\r\n\r\nIn 1750 Richard McAllister was a candidate for sheriff of York County\r\nagainst Colonel Hance Hamilton, who resided near the present site of\r\nGettysburg. The result of the vote was so close that the election was\r\ncontested and the Provincial Assembly decided in favor of Hamilton.\r\n\r\nIn 1763 Richard McAllister founded the town of Hanover and soon became\r\none of the leading citizens of York County.\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of the Revolution he was elected a member of the\r\nCommittee of Safety for York County, and in June of the same year, 1775,\r\nhe served as a delegate in the Provincial Conference, which met in\r\nCarpenters’ Hall, Philadelphia. He again served as a member of the same\r\nbody in January, 1776.\r\n\r\nWhen the Fourth Battalion of York County militia was organized, 1775,\r\nRichard McAllister was commissioned colonel. And during the fall of the\r\nsame year, he was made colonel of a battalion of Minute Men, formed out\r\nof the militia of York County.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1776, when Congress called for ten thousand troops, Colonel\r\nMcAllister marched his battalion through Lancaster and Philadelphia to\r\nPerth Amboy, N. J.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hugh Mercer organized the Flying Camp, and selected Colonel\r\nMcAllister to command the Second Pennsylvania Regiment.\r\n\r\nThis command was soon engaged in and about New York City and Staten\r\nIsland. A short time later Colonel McAllister led the regiment in the\r\ndefense of Fort Washington, where a large number of them were taken\r\nprisoners, among them being two of his captains.\r\n\r\nIn the campaign of 1776 Colonel McAllister was present with his\r\nregiment, under General James Ewing, when Washington captured the\r\nHessians in Trenton on Christmas night.\r\n\r\nAfter the expiration of his term of service in the Flying Camp, in 1777,\r\nColonel McAllister returned to his home at Hanover, and in March of this\r\nyear he was elected by the General Assembly, county lieutenant.\r\n\r\nIn the discharge of this commission he recruited six different\r\nbattalions of militia in York County, which then included the present\r\nAdams County.\r\n\r\nHe drilled and disciplined the troops and made them ready for the\r\nservice in the field when they were required to defend the State against\r\nthe invasion of the British foe.\r\n\r\nOn August 28, 1777, Colonel McAllister wrote to President Wharton that\r\nthere were dissensions among the Associators in the German townships\r\nnear Hanover. Two hundred freemen had assembled at one place for the\r\npurpose of opposing the draft of the militia for service in the field.\r\n\r\nHe continued by saying that he had lived in peace among these people for\r\ntwenty years or more, and knew well their customs and habits, but it was\r\nvery difficult to induce them to take up arms against the country to\r\nwhich they had sworn allegiance.\r\n\r\nHe said that notwithstanding the difficulties he had encountered in the\r\nprosecution of his duties as lieutenant of York County, he had marched\r\nfive companies to the front fully armed and equipped, and would soon\r\nhave three more ready to take up the march for the main army.\r\n\r\nNearly every man recruited was a substitute, which had obtained by\r\nColonel McAllister.\r\n\r\nDuring the years 1783 to 1786, Colonel McAllister was a member of the\r\nSupreme Executive Council, and also served as a member of the Council of\r\nCensors. In the latter position he was engaged in the disposition of the\r\nconfiscated estates of Pennsylvania Tories.\r\n\r\nLike such a great number of the soldiers of the Revolution, Colonel\r\nMcAllister also took a deep interest in legal affairs. He served as a\r\njustice of the peace, and then as justice of the court of common pleas\r\nin March, 1771.\r\n\r\nHe was a member of the First Constitutional Convention, in 1776, and on\r\nFebruary 17, 1784, he became the presiding justice of the York County\r\nCourts.\r\n\r\nWhen General Washington passed through Hanover, June 30, 1791, on his\r\nway to Philadelphia, he spent several hours the guest of Colonel\r\nMcAllister.\r\n\r\nHe died at his home in Hanover, October 7, 1795.\r\n\r\nHis remains were first buried in the graveyard belonging to Emanuel’s\r\nReformed Church of Hanover, of which he was a member and one of the\r\nleading supporters.\r\n\r\nAbout 1870 the remains of this distinguished patriot were removed to\r\nMount Olivet Cemetery, in the suburbs of Hanover, where they now repose.\r\n\r\nOn every succeeding Memorial Day commemoration services are held at the\r\ntomb of this hero and patriot, by the veterans of the Grand Army of the\r\nRepublic and allied organizations.\r\n\r\nColonel McAllister had eleven children. His eldest son, Abdiel,\r\ncommanded a company in Arnold’s expedition to Quebec; another son,\r\nArchibald, commanded a company in the battles of Germantown and\r\nMonmouth.\r\n\r\nA younger son, Matthew, became first United States district attorney of\r\nGeorgia, judge of the Superior Court of that State, and was Mayor of\r\nSavannah during War of 1812.\r\n\r\nA son of Matthew, named Julian McAllister, commanded a regiment in the\r\nUnion Army during the Civil War.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  King Tedyuskung Questioned at Great\r\n                      Indian Conference in Easton,\r\n                            October 8, 1758\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernor Denny informed the Assembly September 12, 1758, that a general\r\nmeeting of Indians has been agreed upon, to take place in Easton.\r\n\r\nTedyuskung and some of his retinue arrived early in Easton, and started\r\non a debauch while awaiting the important event. Whereupon Reverend\r\nRichard Peters, the Provincial secretary, was requested to go to Easton\r\nimmediately to keep the Indians in order.\r\n\r\nThis conference was opened Sunday, October 8, 1758, with 500 Indians in\r\nattendance. Governor Denny, members of Council and the Assembly,\r\nCommissioners for Indian Affairs in New Jersey, Conrad Weiser, George\r\nCroghan and a large number of Quakers from Philadelphia made up the\r\nattendance of the whites.\r\n\r\nGovernor Bernard, of New Jersey, joined the conference when it had been\r\nin session three days, and promptly demanded that the Munsee deliver up\r\ncaptives taken from that Province.\r\n\r\nAll the tribes of the Six Nations took part in the treaty; but the\r\nMohawk had only one deputy, Nikes Carigiatatie, in attendance, and the\r\nCayuga were represented by a single chief, Kandt, alias “Last Night.”\r\n\r\nUnlike the several previous conferences, Tedyuskung was not the\r\nprincipal speaker at this treaty, but that proud position was assumed by\r\nTakeghsatu, a Seneca. He early addressed the Governor and others in\r\nthese words:\r\n\r\n“Brethren—I now speak at the request of Tedyuskung and our cousins the\r\nDelawares, living at Wyoming and on the waters of the River Susquehanna.\r\nWe now remove the hatchet out of your heads that was struck into them by\r\nour cousins, the Delawares. It was a French hatchet that they\r\nunfortunately made use of, by the instigation of the French. We take it\r\nout of your heads and bury it under the ground, where it shall always\r\nrest and never be taken up again. Our cousins, the Delawares, have\r\nassured us they will never think of war against their brethren, the\r\nEnglish, any more, but will employ their thoughts about peace and\r\ncultivating friendship with them, and never suffer enmity against them\r\nto enter their minds again.”\r\n\r\nTwo days later, Nikes, the Mohawk, stood up and, addressing himself to\r\nGovernors Denny and Bernard, said:\r\n\r\n“We thought proper to meet you here to have some discourse about our\r\nnephew, Tedyuskung. You all know that he gives out that he is a great\r\nman and chief of ten nations. This is his constant discourse. Now I, on\r\nbehalf of the Mohawks, say that we do not know he is such a great man,\r\nif he is such a great man, we desire to know who made him so. Perhaps\r\nyou have; and if this be the case, tell us so. It may be the French have\r\nmade him so. We want to inquire and know whence the greatness arose.”\r\n\r\nTakeghsatu, on behalf of the Seneca, said his nation “say the same as\r\nNikes has done.”\r\n\r\nThen Assarandongnas spoke on behalf of the Onondaga and said: “I am here\r\nto represent the Onondagas, and I say for them that I never heard before\r\nnow that Tedyuskung was such a great man, and much less can I tell who\r\nmade him so. No such thing was ever said in our town as that Tedyuskung\r\nwas such a great man.”\r\n\r\nThen followed, in the same strain, Thomas King, chief of Oneida, in\r\nbehalf of the Oneida, Cayuga, Tuscarora, Nanticoke, Conoy and Tutelo.\r\n\r\nUnder this concerted attack upon his kingly pretensions Tedyuskung sat\r\nlike a stoic and never said a word in reply; but Governor Denny arose\r\nand denied that he had made Tedyuskung “a great man,” but said in\r\nexplanation that he had represented the Delaware at appointed places and\r\nhad acted for the other Six Nations only as a messenger, who were his\r\nuncles and superiors. The Governor of New Jersey indorsed Governor\r\nDenny’s speech.\r\n\r\nFive days after this discussion Tedyuskung arose in the public\r\nconference and addressing himself to the deputies of the Six Nations,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“Uncles, you may remember that you have placed us at Wyoming and\r\nShamokin—places where Indians have lived before. Now I hear that you\r\nhave since sold that land to our brethren, the English. Let the matter\r\nnow be cleared up in the presence of our brethren the English. I sit\r\nhere as a bird on a bough. I look about and do not know where to go. Let\r\nme, therefore, come down upon the ground and make that my own by a good\r\ndeed, and I shall have a home forever. For if you, my uncles, or I, die,\r\nour brethren, the English, will say they have bought it from you, and so\r\nwrong my posterity out of it.”\r\n\r\nThomas King, speaking for the Six Nations the following day, addressed\r\nhimself to the Delaware in these words:\r\n\r\n“By this belt Tedyuskung desired us to make you, the Delawares, the\r\nowners of the lands at Wyoming, Shamokin and other places on the\r\nSusquehanna River. In answer to which, we, who are present, say that we\r\nhave no power to convey lands to any one; but we will take your request\r\nto the Great Council fire for their sentiments, as we never sell or\r\nconvey lands before it is agreed upon in the Great Council of the Six\r\nNations. In the meantime, you may make use of those lands in conjunction\r\nwith our people.”\r\n\r\nLater in the open conference Thomas King presented Tedyuskung with a\r\nstring of wampum and said: “This serves to put Tedyuskung in mind of his\r\npromises to return prisoners. You ought to have performed it before. It\r\nis a shame for one who calls himself a great man to tell lies.”\r\n\r\nLast Night and Nikes, in behalf of the Six Nations, promised to satisfy\r\nthe English as to the return of captives, adding: “If any of them are\r\ngone down our throats, we will heave them up again.”\r\n\r\nThen Takeghsatu told Tedyuskung, the Six Nations having promised to\r\nreturn all captives, the Delaware and Munsee must do likewise.\r\n\r\nThus King Tedyuskung was humiliated in the conference, but never to the\r\npoint where he ceased to be a most potent factor on the frontiers of\r\nPennsylvania, and in the eyes of the English he was the king he\r\nprofessed himself to be.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important matters disposed of at this treaty related to\r\nthe lands purchased by the Pennsylvania Proprietaries at Albany, July 6,\r\n1754.\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of this conference one of the Seneca chiefs in\r\nattendance died. He was interred with public ceremony; all the Indians\r\nand many of the inhabitants attended the obsequies.\r\n\r\nOn October 26, the business of the treaty having been finished after\r\neighteen days of speech-making, “some wine and punch were ordered, and\r\nthe conferences were concluded, with great joy and mutual satisfaction.”\r\n\r\nThe Indians were supplied with hats, caps, knives, jewsharps, powder,\r\nlead paints and walking-sticks (the term by which the Indians referred\r\nto rum). In addition, Tedyuskung and other chiefs each received a\r\nmilitary hat trimmed with gold lace, a regimental coat and a ruffled\r\nshirt.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Governor William Denny Removed and\r\n                  Superseded by James Hamilton, Native\r\n                    of Pennsylvania, October 9, 1759\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing the destruction of the Indian town at Kittanning, September 8,\r\n1756, by Lieutenant Colonel John Armstrong, and the Indian incursions\r\nwhich reached to every section of the frontier, a chain of forts was\r\nbuilt the following year which extended from the Delaware River to the\r\nMaryland line. These were garrisoned by troops in the pay of the\r\nProvince.\r\n\r\nThis defense was made possible only when the Assembly finally awakened\r\nto the serious danger and distress, concerted to pass a bill for raising\r\nby tax £100,000, with the exemption of the proprietary estates. They\r\nalso sent Dr. Benjamin Franklin, as provincial agent, to London, to lay\r\ntheir grievance before the King.\r\n\r\nDespite the wartime attitude of England, nothing was done to annoy the\r\nFrench or to check the depredations of the savages, until Dr. Franklin’s\r\npresence in London, and the fortunate change in the ministry, which\r\nbrought the master mind of William Pitt, Earl of Chatham, to assume\r\ncontrol of the government.\r\n\r\nPitt was endowed with a high order of intellect, eloquent, profound and\r\npatriotic. He seemed to possess in an eminent degree the full confidence\r\nof the nation and the command of its resources.\r\n\r\nFranklin’s exertions resulted in gaining the influence of Pitt’s\r\ncomprehensive mind, and soon his attention was directed to America, when\r\nthe affairs in the colonies assumed an entirely different aspect.\r\n\r\nPitt’s plans of operation were grand, his policy bold, liberal and\r\nenlightened, all of which seemed greatly to animate the colonists and\r\ninspire them with new hopes.\r\n\r\nThe colonists resolved to make every effort and sacrifice which the\r\noccasion might require. A circular from Pitt assured the Colonial\r\ngovernments that he was determined to repair past losses, and would\r\nimmediately send to America a force sufficiently large to accomplish the\r\npurpose. He called upon the different Governments to raise as many men\r\nas possible, promising to send over all the necessary munitions of war,\r\nand pledging himself to pay liberally all soldiers who enlisted.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania equipped two thousand seven hundred men, while the\r\nneighboring provinces contributed large quotas. Three expeditions were\r\ndetermined upon, and most active measures taken to bring them to the\r\nfield of action.\r\n\r\nGeneral James Abercrombie was appointed commander-in-chief and General\r\nJeffrey Amherst second in command, aided by Brigadier Generals Wolfe and\r\nForbes.\r\n\r\nThe French were vigorously attacked on the northern frontiers of New\r\nYork. General Forbes was charged with an expedition against Fort\r\nDuquesne, to be aided by the provincial troops of Pennsylvania and\r\nVirginia, under Colonel Henry Bouquet and Colonel George Washington.\r\nThese troops rendezvoused at Raystown, now Bedford.\r\n\r\nGeneral Forbes, with regulars, marched from Philadelphia to effect a\r\njunction with the force at Raystown, but in consequence of severe\r\nindisposition he did not get farther than Carlisle, when he was\r\ncompelled to stop. He marched to Bedford about the middle of September\r\n(1758), where he met the provincial troops under Washington.\r\n\r\nThe march and investment of Fort Duquesne are told in another story and\r\nthe details will not be repeated here, except to state that Washington\r\nstrongly urged that General Forbes should use the road cut by General\r\nBraddock three years earlier, as it was the most favorable route. But\r\nthe Pennsylvanians were bent upon the policy of securing a new road\r\nexclusively through their province, and they succeeded.\r\n\r\nMany weeks were consumed in cutting this road; but at length the army,\r\nconsisting of 7859 men, penetrated the thick forest, and on reaching the\r\nOhio River found Fort Duquesne abandoned by the French after they had\r\nblown up a large magazine and burned the buildings.\r\n\r\nThe French had retreated down the river, relinquishing forever their\r\ndominion in Pennsylvania. The fort was rebuilt, and received the\r\nimmortal name of Pitt.\r\n\r\nThe posts on French Creek still remained in French possession, but it\r\nwas deemed unnecessary to proceed against them, as the character of the\r\nwar in the north left very little doubt that the contest would soon\r\ncease by complete overthrow of the French.\r\n\r\nIn 1759 Ticonderoga, Crown Point, Niagara and Quebec yielded to British\r\narms and on September 8, 1760, Montreal, Detroit and all of Canada were\r\nsurrendered by the French. The treaty of Fontainbleau, in November,\r\n1762, put an end to the war.\r\n\r\nBut in our own province, our troubles were not as easily solved as were\r\nEngland’s under the great Sir William Pitt. A second great Indian\r\nconference was convened at Easton in October, 1758.\r\n\r\nTedyuskung, the great Delaware King, at this treaty received one of\r\nthose insulting taunts from the Six Nations by which they, too often,\r\nexhibited their national superiority; taunts, however, that were deeply\r\nrevenged upon the whites in after years, when the Delaware had thrown\r\noff the galling yoke.\r\n\r\nTedyuskung again supported his station with dignity and firmness, and\r\nrefused to succumb and the different Indian tribes at length became\r\nreconciled to each other.\r\n\r\nOctober 9, 1759, Governor William Denny was superseded by James\r\nHamilton. Governor Denny was removed by the Proprietary on account of\r\nhaving yielded to the demands of the Assembly in giving his approval to\r\ntheir money bill.\r\n\r\nGovernor Hamilton, son of Andrew Hamilton, was the first native of\r\nPennsylvania to serve as Lieutenant Governor. At the death of his\r\nfather, in 1741, he was left in possession of a handsome fortune, and in\r\nthe appointment of Prothonotary, then the most lucrative office in the\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\nHe was first appointed Lieutenant Governor in 1748, serving until\r\nOctober, 1754, then again called to this executive position, which he\r\nfilled until 1763. He held several other offices of distinction in the\r\nprovince, and enjoyed the confidence and esteem of the people, but his\r\nloyal feelings to the Crown caused him to be unfriendly to the\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nThe continued victories of the English put new inspiration into the\r\npeople, who now returned in great number to the plantations from which\r\nthey had been driven by the French and their Indian allies.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 First of Three Confederate Raids into\r\n                  Pennsylvania Began October 10, 1862\r\n\r\n\r\nThe part of our great Commonwealth which lies between the South and Blue\r\nMountains, in the fertile and beautiful Cumberland Valley, since March\r\n11, 1809, known as Franklin County, was from the very earliest recorded\r\nhistory of Pennsylvania the scene of many stirring events.\r\n\r\nBeing on the southern border of the State, it shared in the land and\r\nanimated border fight between the proprietary Governments of Maryland\r\nand Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nIt was in a valley loved as the home of the Indians and on the great\r\npathway through the Tuscarora Mountains and was the scene of many\r\nterrible Indian incursions both before and after the French and Indian\r\nWar.\r\n\r\nAs the County of Franklin was not erected at the time of the\r\nRevolutionary War its activities were not written into the martial story\r\nof Pennsylvania as a division of the great State.\r\n\r\nIn the War of 1812 the county played an active role and sent to the\r\nfront eight companies organized within its limits.\r\n\r\nBut it is of a latter period that this county suffered at the hands of\r\nan invading host and on three occasions had its homes raided, stores\r\nplundered and part of Chambersburg, the county seat, destroyed by\r\nfirebrand.\r\n\r\nThe Civil War was hardly begun when it became potent to every one that\r\nthe Cumberland Valley would be the objective of any Confederate raid\r\ninto Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nEasy of access from the Potomac and with the fertile fields as fresh\r\nforaging grounds for guerilla cavalry, the people realized that they\r\nwere uncomfortably situated. This fear was well grounded from the fact\r\nthat our southern border was virtually unprotected.\r\n\r\nThe first Confederate raid into Pennsylvania was planned and\r\nsuccessfully executed October 10, 1862, by Generals J. E. B. Stuart and\r\nWade Hampton with about two thousand troops.\r\n\r\nThis force crossed the Potomac River and by hurried marches pushed into\r\nPennsylvania, reaching Chambersburg on the evening of that day. With the\r\nfall of night came a drizzling rain, in the midst of which the sound of\r\nfife and drum was heard, heralding the approach of a squad of officers\r\nand men under a flag of truce, who rode to the public square and there\r\ndemanded the surrender of the town in the name of the Confederate States\r\nof America.\r\n\r\nThere was no military authority in the town to treat with the invaders,\r\nso the civil authorities, represented by the Chief Burgess, formally\r\ndelivered up the town into their custody, and in a few moments the\r\nstreets of the borough were filled with gray-uniformed soldiers, the\r\ntramp of horses, the rattling of sabers and spurs, and the dull thud of\r\naxes busied in demolishing store doors and in felling telegraph poles,\r\nwhich made sad music for the frightened inhabitants.\r\n\r\nChambersburg could hardly have been in worse condition for a raid. No\r\nsoldiers were stationed there, and an enormous quantity of military\r\nstores was within its confines.\r\n\r\nDuring the night the business houses were ransacked and the office and\r\nshops of the Cumberland Valley Railroad and the office of the Western\r\nUnion Telegraph Company demolished.\r\n\r\nThe next morning their attention was turned to the attack on the\r\nmilitary stores in the large brick warehouse of Messrs. Wunderlich &\r\nNead, in the northern section of the town. These stores consisted of\r\nammunition, shells, signal rockets and small arms, which only a short\r\ntime previous had been captured from General Longstreet, and sufficient\r\nnew equipment added for two full companies of cavalry, then being\r\nmustered in Franklin County.\r\n\r\nSoon as every article of value to an army had been removed, the torch\r\nwas applied to the building, and when the flames reached the powder an\r\nexplosion took place which completed the entire destruction of the\r\nproperty. The rebels then beat a hasty retreat toward the Southland,\r\nleaving the inhabitants of Chambersburg in a terrified condition.\r\n\r\nThe following summer found the star of secession at its greatest height.\r\nLee’s army was never in better spirits and every soldier looked with\r\ncovetous eyes on the rich fields of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nLee succumbed to the temptation, and in the face of his better judgment,\r\nplanned his northern campaign, and by a military movement, seldom\r\nequaled, marched his entire army across the border line of Pennsylvania,\r\nonly to meet his Waterloo at Gettysburg. The approach of this great\r\ninvading horde caused a mighty panic which shook with fear the very\r\ncapital city of the old Keystone State, and every town and hamlet felt\r\nthe alarm.\r\n\r\nThe fight at Winchester on June 13, 1863, forced the retreat of General\r\nMilroy, who stood alone as a barrier to Lee’s advance. On the following\r\nday General Couch removed his headquarters from Chambersburg to\r\nCarlisle.\r\n\r\nAbout 9 o’clock on the morning of the 15th the advance of Milroy’s\r\nretreating wagon train dashed into Chambersburg, closely pursued by the\r\nrebels.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment General Jenkins with 1800 mounted rebel infantry rode\r\ninto Greencastle. After a reconnoissance the town was occupied by the\r\nrebel horde and divested of everything movable, contraband and\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\nThe rebels then pushed on toward Chambersburg, where they reached the\r\noutskirts about 11 o’clock that night.\r\n\r\nAgain the streets of Chambersburg resounded with the clatter of cavalry,\r\nand a second time the town fell their easy prey.\r\n\r\nThis visit continued three days during which time everything of value,\r\nespecially horses, were taken without pretense of compensation.\r\n\r\nGeneral Jenkins on the 18th fell back to Greencastle, and then proceeded\r\nto Mercersburg, whence a detachment crossed Cove Mountain to\r\nMcConnellsburg and down the valley. The main part of the invading force\r\nremained in the vicinity of Greencastle and Waynesboro, where plundering\r\nparties scoured that entire section.\r\n\r\nThe third terrible visitation of the Confederates in Chambersburg was\r\nthe deliberate sacking and burning of the town by Generals McCausland\r\nand Johnson, on July 30, 1864.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Colonel Matthew Smith, War Veteran,\r\n                     Elected Vice President October\r\n                                11, 1779\r\n\r\n\r\nOn October 11, 1779, Vice President George Bryan resigned his office,\r\nwhereupon Colonel Matthew Smith, a veteran officer of the French and\r\nIndian War, and one who commanded a company in Arnold’s expedition to\r\nQuebec, then a citizen of Milton, Northumberland County, was chosen to\r\nfill the vacancy, which he, too, resigned on the 29th of the month.\r\nWilliam Moore was elected to the position, November 12.\r\n\r\nOn November 27, the Assembly after careful consideration, adopted a\r\nresolution annulling the Royal Charter, and granting the Penns, as a\r\ncompensation for the rights of which they were deprived, £300,000.\r\n\r\nThey retained their manors, however, and were still the largest landed\r\nproprietors in Pennsylvania. They subsequently received from the British\r\nGovernment an annuity of £4000 for their losses by the Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe act for the gradual abolition of slavery in Pennsylvania was passed\r\nMarch 1, 1780. It provided for the registration of every Negro or\r\nmulatto slave, or servant for life, before November 1, following, and\r\nalso provided, “No man or woman of any nation or color, except the\r\nNegroes or mulattoes who shall be registered as aforesaid, shall at any\r\ntime hereafter be deemed, adjudged, or holden within the territory of\r\nthis Commonwealth, as slaves or servants for life, but as free men and\r\nfree women.”\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1780, every effort was made to keep the State up to par\r\nby passing several measures which brought but temporary relief.\r\n\r\nAn agent was sent to France and Holland to borrow £200,000, with the\r\nfaith and honor of the State pledged for its repayment, but the mission\r\nwas unfruitful.\r\n\r\nThe army was without clothing and short of provisions. Subscriptions\r\nwere solicited by the ladies to relieve this distress. The “Bank of\r\nPennsylvania” was established and still the Continental money continued\r\nto sink in value.\r\n\r\nVirginia was induced to accede to Pennsylvania’s proposition to appoint\r\ncommissioners to adjust the boundary. Pennsylvania appointed George\r\nBryan, the Rev. Dr. John Ewing and David Rittenhouse; Virginia sent\r\nJames Madison, afterward President of the United States, and Robert\r\nAndrews.\r\n\r\nThese commissioners met August 31, 1779, and agreed that Mason and\r\nDixon’s line should be extended due west five degrees of longitude from\r\nthe Delaware River for the southern boundary of Pennsylvania, and that a\r\nmeridian line drawn from the western extremity thereof to the northern\r\nlimit of the State should be the western boundary.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly of Pennsylvania ratified this on November 19, but Virginia\r\nproceeded to Fort Burd and occupied it. In March, 1780, the Assembly\r\nresolved to eject intruders under claims from other States, and\r\nauthorized Council to raise troops for internal defense of the frontier;\r\nbut Virginia afterward ratified the agreement and the southern line was\r\nrun in 1784 and the western afterward.\r\n\r\nToward the close of September, 1780, the Supreme Executive Council\r\nreceived the startling intelligence of the treason of General Benedict\r\nArnold, who had been in command of the American post at West Point.\r\nAmong the people the news of the infamy of this officer excited the\r\ngreatest indignation.\r\n\r\nIn Philadelphia a parade was held, three days after the arrival of the\r\nnews, to give expression to the popular feeling.\r\n\r\nDuring this demonstration an effigy of Arnold was carried through the\r\nstreets and finally hung upon a gallows. The Council at once confiscated\r\nArnold’s estate, and his wife was ordered deported from the State within\r\nfourteen days.\r\n\r\nThe arrest, trial and execution of Major André, and the escape of\r\nArnold, his reward and price of dishonor, the sufferings and disgrace of\r\nhis unfortunate wife Peggy are not within the scope of these stories.\r\n\r\nIf the proceedings against Tories in Pennsylvania had been fierce\r\nprevious to this time, the feeling aroused by the defection of Arnold\r\nproduced the bitterest animosity and hatred against all who were not in\r\nfull sympathy with the American Colonies.\r\n\r\nMany arrests were made, a number were tried and condemned, and one, a\r\nQuaker, of Chester County, executed for high treason. The property of\r\nprominent Tories was forfeited and sold, and, in fact, the most\r\nenergetic measures taken to crush out whatever might be inimical to the\r\ncause of independence.\r\n\r\nThe situation among the soldiers from Pennsylvania in the Continental\r\nArmy at this period was deplorable. About December 1, the division of\r\nGeneral Wayne went into winter quarters in the environs of Norristown.\r\nThe soldiers were wearied out with privations, and indignant at their\r\nofficers, whom they accused of not properly representing their situation\r\nto Congress.\r\n\r\nOn New Year’s Day, 1781, there broke out such a mutiny in the\r\nPennsylvania Line that it required the best efforts of Congress, the\r\nGovernment of Pennsylvania, and the officers of the army to subdue.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania Line comprised 2500, one-third to two-thirds of the\r\narmy, the soldiers from the other colonies having, in the main, gone\r\nhome. Their terms of service had long since expired. They had not been\r\npaid for a year, and they were almost without clothes.\r\n\r\nThen under the leadership of a brave sergeant, named William Bowser,\r\nthey arose in arms and proceeded to settle matters for themselves. Two\r\nemissaries from General Clinton seeking to corrupt them they handed over\r\nto Washington to be hanged.\r\n\r\nThe terms of service of 1250 men had expired. They were discharged and\r\nthe matter of indebtedness to them was arranged. The most of them\r\nre-enlisted.\r\n\r\nHowever unjustifiable the conduct of the Pennsylvania Line was and\r\nshould be deemed in the first instance, it must be acknowledged that\r\nthey conducted themselves in the business, culpable as it was, with\r\nunexpected order and regularity.\r\n\r\nTheir refusing to accept the large offer made by the enemy, in\r\ndelivering up the spies, and in refusing the hundred guineas they had so\r\njustly merited, exhibits an instance of true patriotism not to be found\r\namong mercenary troops who bear arms for pay and subsistence only,\r\nuninspired by their country’s rights, or the justice of the cause which\r\nthey have engaged to support.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Attempted Slaughter of Indians at Wichetunk,\r\n                    Monroe County, October 12, 1763\r\n\r\n\r\nThe expedition of Colonel Henry Bouquet, during the Pontiac Conspiracy,\r\nto Fort Pitt, in a great measure served to check the depredations of the\r\nIndians for a short time and the frontiers of Pennsylvania were quiet,\r\nand under the protection and assistance of 700 Provincial recruits the\r\nsettlers gathered their harvests.\r\n\r\nHad the Provincial Assembly acted promptly in the matter an effective\r\ndefense could have been provided. The Government was deaf to all\r\nentreaties, and General Jeffreys Amherst, commander of the British\r\nforces in America, did not hesitate to vent his feelings in emphatic\r\nexpression:\r\n\r\n“The conduct of the Pennsylvania Assembly is altogether so infatuated\r\nand stupidly obstinate that I want words to express my indignation\r\nthereat. They tamely look on while their brethren are butchered by the\r\nsavages.”\r\n\r\nThe Assembly finally authorized the raising of 800 troops and voted\r\n£24,000 to keep that force until December 1, but declared it was both\r\nunjust and impracticable for the province to defend a frontier of nearly\r\n300 miles, which covered a greater extent than that of New Jersey and\r\nMaryland, without assistance from other provinces.\r\n\r\nIn September and October outrages were committed as far east as the\r\nneighborhoods of Reading and Bethlehem, and it was believed that not\r\nonly Fort Pitt but even Fort Augusta was destined for attack.\r\n\r\nThe road to Fort Pitt was interrupted. A supply of provisions, under a\r\nconvoy of sixty men, was forwarded from Fort Bedford to Fort Pitt, but\r\non gaining the foot of the Allegheny Mountains was compelled to return.\r\nThe officers learned that the passages were occupied by the savages.\r\n\r\nSome fragments of the Delaware and Six Nations remained at their\r\nsettlements in the interior, refusing to join their brethren in arms,\r\nprofessing affection for the Colonists and avowing a determination to\r\ncontinue neutral. But the neutrality of a part, at least, of these\r\nIndians was very doubtful.\r\n\r\nThe situation of the frontiers became truly deplorable, and the Quakers,\r\nwho were in control, suffered the censure of the people. Captain Lazerus\r\nStewart, of Paxtang, expressed the views of those on the frontiers, when\r\nhe said: “The Quakers are more solicitous for the welfare of the\r\nblood-thirsty Indians than for the lives of the frontiersmen.”\r\n\r\nColonel John Armstrong led 300 men of Cumberland County to Great Island,\r\non the West Branch of the Susquehanna, the present site of the borough\r\nof Lock Haven, where certain of the marauders had their headquarters. On\r\ntheir arrival they found the place evacuated, horses, cattle and other\r\nspoils gathered in their forays being left behind.\r\n\r\nWith the main body of his men, Armstrong proceeded to another Indian\r\nvillage near Jersey Shore, where he found the late occupants had left in\r\nhaste while eating a meal. So the expedition resulted in destroying\r\ntheir houses and corn fields.\r\n\r\nMajor Asher Clayton led a party from Harris’ Ferry to remove the\r\nConnecticut settlers from Wyoming and destroy their provisions, which\r\nwere likely to be seized by the red men. When the party arrived at\r\nWyoming, it found that the savages had been there before them and had\r\nburned the town and killed more than twenty persons in horrible torture.\r\n\r\nA number of those Indians who had been converted by the Moravian\r\nmissionaries around Bethlehem were murdered, as they were found asleep\r\nin a barn, by a party of Rangers, and the surprise and slaughter in turn\r\nof the latter increased the suspicion of the frontiersmen, who were\r\nneither Moravians nor Quakers, against the entire body of Christian red\r\nmen, who professed a desire to live at peace and friendship with the\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nThe Provincial Commissioners, indeed, reported their belief that those\r\nat Nain and Wichetunk (in what is now Polk Township, Monroe County) were\r\nsecretly supplied by the Moravian brethren with arms and ammunition,\r\nwhich, in free intercourse with the hostile savages, were traded off to\r\nthe latter.\r\n\r\nAbout October 12 a number of armed men marched toward Wichetunk, but,\r\nwaiting to surprise it by night, were frustrated by a violent storm just\r\nbefore nightfall, which wet their powder.\r\n\r\nThe missionary, the Rev. Bernard Adam Grube, then led the Indians to\r\nNazareth, but the Governor suggested that to watch their behavior it\r\nwould be better to disarm them and bring them to the interior parts of\r\nthe province. The Assembly, actuated more by a desire to save them,\r\nagreed to the proposal.\r\n\r\nGovernor John Penn received the refugees from Nain and Wichetunk, but\r\ntheir arrival in the Northern Liberties of Philadelphia excited the\r\nlower classes nearly to a riot, and the soldiers refused to allow them\r\nany part of the barracks as a sheltering place, so that different\r\narrangements were necessary.\r\n\r\nFor five hours these Indians were in great peril, but escorted by\r\nQuakers, they were finally taken to Province Island.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the Assembly, in which there were twenty-one Quakers,\r\nfailed to satisfy not only the royal and proprietary officers but also\r\nthe Presbyterians, who were ready to take up arms, and particularly the\r\nScotch-Irish on the frontier, who saw large sums of money lavished in\r\nthe presents to Indians, while they themselves lay destitute from the\r\nravages of an Indian war.\r\n\r\nAs every now and then some of their kinsmen or neighbors fell by the\r\ntomahawk, they became exasperated, coupling their vengeance against the\r\nguilty savages with jealousy of the Assembly’s partiality, and also\r\nsuspicion against those Indians who were treated as friends.\r\n\r\nA cry like the Covenanters came from their descendants in Pennsylvania;\r\nloud exhortations were heard on the frontier to carry out against the\r\nheathen red men the decrees of heaven against the Canaanites.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n           Molly Pitcher, Heroine of the Battle of Monmouth,\r\n                         Born October 13, 1754\r\n\r\n\r\nThere have been many stories of “Molly Pitcher,” and they have not\r\nalways agreed even on the main facts. But on the occasion of the\r\nceremonies incident to unveiling the cannon erected over her grave in\r\nthe “Old Graveyard,” in Carlisle, by the Patriotic Orders Sons of\r\nAmerica, on June 28, 1905, an excellent short biography of the “Heroine\r\nof the Battle of Monmouth” was prepared by John B. Landis, Esq., from\r\nwhich the following story is taken.\r\n\r\nThe heroine’s name was not “Pitcher,” but Ludwig, and at the time she\r\nearned her well-known sobriquet she was the wife of an artilleryman. Her\r\nfather, John George Ludwig, came to this country from the Palatinate,\r\nand settled near Trenton, in Mercer County, New Jersey, where he engaged\r\nin the occupation of dairyman. It was here his daughter Mary was born,\r\non October 13, 1754, and here among the surroundings of her father’s\r\nhome were spent the youthful days of the future “Molly Pitcher.”\r\n\r\nThe wife of Dr. William Irvine, of Carlisle, afterward General William\r\nIrvine, and one of the greatest patriots of the Revolution, was visiting\r\nfriends in Trenton when she saw the youthful Mary Ludwig, and, being\r\npleased with her and in need of a domestic, took the young girl with her\r\non returning to Carlisle.\r\n\r\nMary had hardly become accustomed to her surroundings in the fine home\r\nof Dr. and Mrs. Irvine until she met John Casper Hays, a barber, whose\r\nshop was near the Irvine residence. Their courtship was of short\r\nduration, for a marriage was solemnized on July 24, 1769.\r\n\r\nA few years of quiet wedded life, disturbed only by the warlike\r\npreparations centered about the patriotic town of Carlisle, and John\r\nCasper Hays became a soldier. He enlisted December 1, 1775, in Colonel\r\nThomas Proctor’s First Pennsylvania Artillery, in which he served as a\r\ngunner. His term of enlistment expired December, 1776, but he\r\nre-enlisted January, 1777, in the Seventh Pennsylvania Regiment, of the\r\nContinental Line, in the company commanded by Captain John Alexander, of\r\nCarlisle.\r\n\r\nDr. Irvine also was one of the first patriots to respond to the cause of\r\nthe colonists, and January 9, 1776, was commissioned Colonel of the\r\nSixth Pennsylvania Regiment. He became Brigadier General May 2, 1779.\r\nPrevious to that time, however, on June 6, 1776, he was captured at\r\nThree Rivers, and remained a prisoner on parole until his exchange,\r\nApril 21, 1778, when he assumed command of the Seventh Pennsylvania\r\nRegiment, in which John Casper Hays was a private soldier.\r\n\r\nAfter young Hays left Carlisle with his regiment, his wife remained\r\nemployed at Colonel Irvine’s. Some time thereafter her parents, who\r\nstill resided in New Jersey, sent a message with courier for her to\r\nvisit them, and the same horseman carried a letter from her husband,\r\nbegging her to go, as he might then get an opportunity to see her, as\r\nhis regiment was then nearby. With Mrs. Irvine’s consent Mary set out on\r\nher long journey, traveling on horseback. At the time Molly Hays was a\r\nyoung woman of twenty-five years.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the movement of the British on New York, General Washington\r\nmarched his troops again into New Jersey, and the Battle of Monmouth was\r\nfought June 28, 1778.\r\n\r\nThe battle continued from 11 o’clock in the morning until dark, and the\r\nday was one of the hottest of the year. Fifty soldiers are said to have\r\ndied of thirst, and the tongues of many said to have been so greatly\r\nswollen as to protrude from the mouth.\r\n\r\nWhile the battle was in progress Molly carried water for the thirsting\r\nsoldiers from a neighboring spring, which is still pointed out on the\r\nhistoric battlefield. Back and forth she went under shelter or under\r\nfire, supplying the much-needed water. Possibly, as is stated by some,\r\nit was carried in the cannoneer’s bucket. In whatever way it was carried\r\nthe sight of Molly with her “pitcher” was a welcome sight to the weary\r\nand thirsty Continentals.\r\n\r\nMolly’s husband, having served a year in Proctor’s Artillery, and though\r\nnow an infantryman, had been detailed as a gunner in a battery that was\r\nengaged. Doubtless Molly was never out of sight of that battery. As she\r\napproached with water she saw a soldier lying at the gun, whom she\r\nthought to be her husband, and hurrying on she found her husband\r\nwounded, but the dead man was one of his comrades. Her husband\r\nrecovered, but lived only a few years after the close of the war.\r\n\r\nIt is stated that the cannon was ordered to the rear and would have been\r\ntaken off the field had not Molly bravely sprung to her husband’s place,\r\nand so kept the gun in action.\r\n\r\nFor her wonderful patriotism and self-sacrificing devotion to the\r\nsoldiers she was dubbed “Sergeant” and by some called “Major Molly.”\r\n\r\n                  “Moll Pitcher she stood by her gun,\r\n                    And rammed the charges home, sir.\r\n                  And thus on Monmouth’s bloody field\r\n                    A sergeant did become, sir.”\r\n\r\nHow long Molly stood by her gun, through the smoke and din of battle, on\r\nthat hot and terrible day, is not a matter of record, but the water she\r\ncarried to those soldiers and the service she rendered with the battery\r\nhas been testified to by many whom she helped.\r\n\r\nMolly was no imaginary heroine, but a real buxom lass, a strong, sturdy,\r\ncourageous woman. Her name belongs on the roll of the world’s heroines,\r\nand some years ago the State of New Jersey honored “Molly Pitcher” by\r\ncommemorating her heroic act on one of the five tablets surrounding the\r\nbase of the beautiful monument erected at Freehold on the historic\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nSome years after the death of her first husband, Sergeant John Casper\r\nHays, she married George McKolly, another soldier and a comrade of Hays,\r\nand she then became known as Molly McKolly. This name was also written\r\n“McAuley,” and “McCauley” while on her tombstone it was inscribed\r\n“McCauly.”\r\n\r\nAt the entrance to the grounds where until recently was the Carlisle\r\nIndian School, formerly for many years United States barracks, still\r\nstands the old stone guard house, which was built by the Hessian\r\nprisoners taken at the Battle of Trenton, and which escaped the fire\r\nwhen the barracks were burned by the Confederates in 1863.\r\n\r\nAt that post Molly lived for many years after the Revolutionary War,\r\ncooking and washing for the soldiers. Subsequently she kept a small\r\nstore in the town proper, but the latter years of her life were lived in\r\na stone house, where she died on Sunday, January 22, 1832. She attended\r\nthe Lutheran Church and was respected by her neighbors.\r\n\r\nOn July 4, 1876, a marble headstone was unveiled over her grave, which\r\nhad been erected by Peter Spohr, who knew her well and was present at\r\nher funeral. On this occasion an eloquent and interesting address was\r\ndelivered by Captain Joseph G. Vale, a veteran officer of the Civil War.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                William Penn, Born October 14, 1644—His\r\n                Youth and Early Struggles for Religious\r\n                                 Belief\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Penn, founder of Pennsylvania and one of the most distinguished\r\nmembers of the Society of Friends, or Quakers, a preacher and writer,\r\nwas born in London, October 14, 1644.\r\n\r\nHis father was Admiral Sir William Penn, of the English Royal Navy, and\r\nhis mother was Margaret Jasper, a remarkable Dutch lady, of Rotterdam.\r\n\r\nWhile the Admiral was off on the seas, his wife and little son resided\r\non one of his estates at Wanstead in Essex.\r\n\r\nWilliam Penn went to school at Chigwell, near by, where he was\r\napparently under influences largely Puritan. At the age of eleven strong\r\nreligious conviction came suddenly upon him.\r\n\r\nHis boyhood days were lived during the Protectorate. The Admiral, after\r\nreceiving honors and riches from Cromwell, had so timed his change of\r\nloyalty as to gather in a good share of the rewards distributed at the\r\ntime of the Restoration.\r\n\r\nHe was in a condition to send his son to the most aristocratic of Oxford\r\nColleges, and at the age of fifteen, William Penn became a “Gentleman\r\nCommoner of Christ Church.”\r\n\r\nThrough the preaching of Thomas Loe he became a convert to the doctrine\r\nof the Quakers. The results were not exactly Quakerly, however, for in\r\ncompany with a friend, he forcibly tore from the backs of fellow\r\nstudents the “popish rags,” as surplices were called by the zealous\r\nPuritans of the day.\r\n\r\nFor this he left college, whether by the action of the authorities or\r\nnot does not clearly appear.\r\n\r\nHe went to his home and announced himself a Quaker. His father intended\r\nhim for a high career in the state, and no news could have been more\r\nunwelcome than this. His father turned him out of the house. The mother\r\nreconciled them, and the youth was sent to France, with a hope that gay\r\nsociety in Paris might redeem him from his almost morbid soberness.\r\n\r\nPenn entered partially into the circle of fashion; thence he went to\r\nNaumur, the Protestant college, where he laid the foundation of that\r\nextensive knowledge of patristic literature so much in evidence in his\r\nfuture writings; thence to Italy, where he received a letter from his\r\nfather calling him home.\r\n\r\nOn his return, in 1664, in compliance with the wishes of his father, he\r\nbecame a student of law.\r\n\r\nThe great fire in London, in 1665, drove him from the city and deepened\r\nhis serious convictions.\r\n\r\nHe was sent by his father to manage his large Irish estates. He joined\r\nthe expedition to put down an insurrection in Carrickfergus, and\r\nprocured for himself a suit of armor, in which he seems to have been\r\npainted. His martial ardor was of short duration.\r\n\r\nThomas Loe again crossed his path in Cork and Penn became a Quaker never\r\nmore to falter. He was soon imprisoned with his fellows, and this was\r\nthe beginning of many and severe confinements which lasted at intervals\r\nthrough his life.\r\n\r\nHis father again drove him from his house. In time they were reconciled\r\nand the Admiral on his deathbed endorsed the course of his son.\r\n\r\nPenn began immediately to preach and to enter into the theological\r\ncontroversy of his time. He was soon arrested and confined in the Tower\r\nnine months, during which he wrote his principal work, entitled “No\r\nCross, No Crown.”\r\n\r\nPenn was again arrested for preaching in the streets of London, and at\r\nhis trial the jury declared him not guilty, but the court determined to\r\nconvict him, ordered the jury to bring in a verdict of guilty. They\r\nrefused and were fined and sent to Newgate Prison.\r\n\r\nOn his release from prison Penn made a trip to Holland and Germany,\r\npreaching the gospel.\r\n\r\nHe took advantage of a little surcease from jails to marry, in his 28th\r\nyear, Gulielma Maria Springett, daughter of Sir William Springett, a\r\nwoman of great beauty and sweetness.\r\n\r\nA declaration of indulgence for dissenters issued by Charles II, in\r\n1672, now made his life easier, and with an ample estate, he settled at\r\nRickmansworth, in Hertfordshire. He was active for a few years in\r\npreaching and wrote much.\r\n\r\nIn 1675 his thoughts were first seriously turned to America. Lord\r\nBerkeley and Sir George Carteret, who had received from the Duke of York\r\nthe promise of New Jersey, sold the western half to two Quakers, John\r\nFenwick and Edward Byllinge.\r\n\r\nThe new purchasers had some difficulty between themselves in the\r\nsettlement of their respective claims and asked William Penn to\r\narbitrate the matter. Penn decided in favor of Byllinge, who soon\r\nafterwards became embarrassed and transferred to Penn and two others his\r\ninterest for the benefit of his creditors.\r\n\r\nWest New Jersey was opened for sale and the persecuted Quakers found\r\nthere a haven of rest.\r\n\r\nPenn wrote to Richard Hartshorne, a settler whom he appointed his agent,\r\n“We lay a foundation for after ages to understand their liberty as men\r\nand Christians, that they may not be brought in bondage but by their own\r\nconsent; for we put the power in the people.”\r\n\r\nThe colony prospered greatly under the management of Penn and his\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nIn company with George Fox, Robert Barclay and others, in 1677, Penn\r\npaid a religious visit to Holland and Germany. Here he made a convert of\r\nthe Princess Elizabeth Palatine, granddaughter of James I, a woman of\r\ngreat intelligence, learning and spirituality, who became a devoted\r\nadherent and correspondent.\r\n\r\nMore important, historically, however, he began that acquaintance with\r\nthe Rhine Valley which resulted in a great emigration of its inhabitants\r\nto his future province of Pennsylvania, in the following century.\r\n\r\nHis journal of this trip is among his printed works.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned he found persecution breaking out anew, many of his\r\nfriends in jail and their estates confiscated.\r\n\r\nPenn published a plea for liberty, even for Papists—a sentiment which,\r\nin that day, required no small courage—and gave rise to a report, from\r\nwhich he afterward suffered greatly, that he was a Jesuit in disguise.\r\n\r\nHe enjoyed great favor at court, and his influence was exerted for the\r\naid of his suffering brethren, and his advocacy of his favorite doctrine\r\nof universal toleration.\r\n\r\nThe rest of William Penn’s life belongs largely to the history of\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               First Massacre in Wyoming Launched During\r\n                     Pontiac’s War by Captain Bull,\r\n                            October 15, 1763\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conspiracy fomented by Pontiac, the Ottawa chieftain, was unmasked\r\nat Detroit on May 6, 1763, and then began the war which continued until\r\nlate in the summer of 1764.\r\n\r\nFort Sandusky was captured by the Indians May 16, 1763; Fort Ouatanon\r\n(now Lafayette, Ind.), May 31; Fort Presqu’ Isle (now Erie County, Pa.),\r\nJune 17; Fort Le Boeuf (in Erie County), June 18; Fort Venango (in\r\nVenango County, Pa.), June 18 and the military posts at Carlisle and\r\nBedford, Pa., on the same day.\r\n\r\nOn June 22 a large body of Indians surrounded Fort Pitt and opened fire\r\non all sides, but were easily repulsed. The Seneca were the only Indians\r\nof the Six Nations in alliance with Pontiac.\r\n\r\nThe report which reached Philadelphia the second week in July, 1763,\r\nrevealed a most alarming situation on the frontier.\r\n\r\nThrough the efforts of the Reverend John Elder the able-bodied men of\r\nthe Paxtang region in Lancaster County were soon organized into a\r\nmounted military battalion of several companies, under the name of the\r\n“Paxtang Rangers” or “Paxtang Boys,” with Elder as colonel in command.\r\n\r\n“Swift on foot, excellent horsemen, good shots, skillful in pursuit or\r\nescape, dexterous as scouts and expert in maneuvering,” the “Paxtang\r\nBoys” became the terror of the Indians. And yet, during the summer and\r\nearly autumn of that year numerous depredations and murders were\r\ncommitted by Indians in the counties of Lancaster and Northampton.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, August 7, Captain Andrew Montour arrived at Fort Augusta from\r\nup the West Branch and informed Colonel James Burd that Forts Pitt and\r\nLigonier had been captured by the Indians. Later this news was learned\r\nto be false, but the loss of Presqu’ Isle, Le Boeuf and Venango was a\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nColonel John Elder wrote Governor Hamilton, requesting that his command\r\nbe allowed “to destroy the immense quantity of corn left by the New\r\nEngland men at Wyoming which, if not consumed, will be a considerable\r\nmagazine to the enemy and enable them with more ease to distress the\r\ninhabitants, etc.” The Governor in his reply stated that he had no\r\nobjection to their scouting as far as Wyoming.\r\n\r\nOn October 13 Major Asher Clayton, with a force of eighty soldiers from\r\nLancaster County, arrived at Fort Augusta, en route to Wyoming. There he\r\nwas joined by Lieutenant Samuel Hunter and twenty-four men of the\r\ngarrison, and the combined force departed Saturday the 15th for Wyoming.\r\n\r\nTwo companies of the Reverend Elder’s command set out from Fort Hunter\r\non the 11th destined for the same place, and “to intercept the murdering\r\nparty on their return to Northampton.”\r\n\r\nThis “murdering party” referred to by Colonel Elder was a band of\r\nhostile Delaware led by Tedyuskung’s son, Captain Bull, and concerning\r\nwhose depredations Governor Hamilton sent a message to the Provincial\r\nAssembly on October 15, in these words:\r\n\r\n“Within a few days past I have received well-attested accounts of many\r\nbarbarous and shocking murders and other depredations having been\r\ncommitted by Indians on inhabitants of Northampton County, in\r\nconsequence whereof great numbers of those who escaped the rage of the\r\nenemy have already deserted, and are daily deserting their habitations;\r\nso that, unless some effectual aid can be speedily granted them, to\r\ninduce them to stand their ground, it is difficult to say where these\r\ndesertions will stop, or to how small a distance from the capital our\r\nfrontier may be reduced.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Bull, who headed this war party of Western Delaware in these\r\nincursions, had spent ten years among these Indians west of the Ohio\r\nRiver. He was thoroughly familiar with their sentiments toward the\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nThe first intimation of the presence of hostile Indians was on October\r\n8, 1763, when before daybreak, Captain Bull attacked the house of John\r\nStenton, on the road from Bethlehem to Fort Allen, where Captain\r\nWetherhold and a squad of soldiers were lodging for the night.\r\nWetherhold and several others of the whites were wounded and three were\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\nA day or two later Yost’s mill, about eleven miles from Bethlehem, was\r\ndestroyed, and the people there cut off. Altogether twenty-three persons\r\nwere killed and many wounded, and these depredations committed within a\r\nfew miles of Captain Bull’s ancestral home.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, October 15, the self-same day that Major Clayton’s\r\nexpedition set out from Fort Augusta for Wyoming, the settlers of Mill\r\nCreek, in Wyoming Valley, were busily engaged in their various\r\noccupations at different places unaware of danger and unprepared for\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\nCaptain Bull and his warriors to the number of 135 swooped down on the\r\nsettlers and death, desperation and destruction quickly followed.\r\nEighteen or more were killed, including many persons of importance. The\r\nscene was terrible.\r\n\r\nThe settlers who heard the gun shots and war whoops of the Indians fled\r\nin great haste to the mountains. At night time the torch was applied and\r\nsoon the homes of the settlers were masses of ruins.\r\n\r\nThe settlers who escaped death tramped back to Connecticut, and Wyoming\r\nwas, in very truth, deserted and forsaken.\r\n\r\nMajor Clayton arrived soon after this massacre, but did not remain, and\r\nreturned to Fort Augusta. An extract from a letter written by a soldier\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n“Our party under Major Asher Clayton is returned from Wyoming, where we\r\nmet with no Indians, but found the New Englanders who had been killed\r\nand scalped a day or two before we got there. We buried the dead—nine\r\nmen and a woman—who had been most cruelly butchered.\r\n\r\n“The woman was roasted, and had two hinges in her hands—supposed to be\r\nput in red hot—and several of the men had awls thrust in their eyes, and\r\nspears, arrows, pitchforks, etc., sticking in their bodies.\r\n\r\n“They (Clayton’s troops) burnt what houses the Indians had left, and\r\ndestroyed a quantity of Indian corn. The enemy’s tracks were up the\r\nriver toward Wyalusing.”\r\n\r\nMany writers have expressed different opinions about this massacre. Some\r\nthought it to have been done by the Delaware who believed the\r\nConnecticut settlers killed their king Tedyuskung; some believe it to\r\nhave been done by Six Nations, who thought the whites had assassinated\r\nthe Delaware king; but others believe there is not sufficient ground for\r\nsupposing it to have been done by friends of Tedyuskung, even though the\r\nhostile party was led by his son, Captain Bull.\r\n\r\nWhoever was to blame, or whoever committed the bloodthirsty deed,\r\nmatters not, but the fact remains that the Delaware Indians were\r\ntreacherous and none of them more so than King Tedyuskung and his sons,\r\nespecially Captain Bull, the perpetrator of this horrible massacre.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             First Terrible Massacre of Settlers at Penn’s\r\n                        Creek, October 16, 1755\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 1755 was anything but one of promise for the English colonies\r\nin America. The French were aggressively pushing their domain from\r\nCanada southward toward the Mississippi Valley, and what was more\r\nalarming to the English was the effort of the French to gain a foothold\r\nin the region of the Allegheny Mountains, in what is now Western\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThree great rivers virtually determined the strategic situation of the\r\nterritory involved between these two great nations. The Hudson River\r\nValley was held by the English, the Susquehanna River Valley by the Six\r\nNations of the great Indian Confederation and the Allegheny River Valley\r\nby French, along the banks of which a chain of French forts had been\r\nerected. Fort Duquesne, at the forks of the Ohio and Monongahela Rivers,\r\nwhere Pittsburgh now stands, was the principal defense of that valley.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1755 the expedition was fitted out which made the\r\nill-fated march against Fort Duquesne and resulted in the defeat of\r\nGeneral Edward Braddock, July 9.\r\n\r\nThis defeat was a terrible disaster and left the frontiers of\r\nPennsylvania threatened with ruin by victorious French and their savage\r\nallies, who pressed through the passes of the Blue Mountains on the\r\nheels of the fleeing British regulars.\r\n\r\nThe main body of the French encamped on the Susquehanna River near where\r\nthe borough of Liverpool now stands, thirty miles above Harris’ Ferry,\r\nwhere they extended themselves on both sides of the main river.\r\n\r\nBraddock’s defeat was not only a fatal termination of a campaign which\r\nhad been expected would inflict a decisive blow upon the French, but it\r\ngave the signal to the disaffected Indians to make the frontiers of the\r\nprovince the scene of predatory warfare in which many sections of the\r\nSusquehanna Valley were severely scourged.\r\n\r\nThe Provincial Government did not act with the energy and promptness\r\nwhich the emergency demanded. No means were adopted for the protection\r\nof frontier settlements and the entire wilderness from the Juniata River\r\nto Shamokin, now Sunbury, was filled with parties of hostile Indians,\r\nmurdering, scalping and burning. Every post brought to the Provincial\r\nCouncil at Philadelphia heart-rending appeals for help.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly and the Governor were deadlocked, no money bills could be\r\npassed. Troops of frontiersmen rode through the city threateningly\r\nbrandishing their weapons. A party of Germans laid the corpses of the\r\ncountrymen, scalped within sixty-five miles of the capital, at the door\r\nof the State House. The Quaker peace policy was denounced in unmeasured\r\nterms from the backwoods pulpits.\r\n\r\nThe Indians had driven off the Moravian missions at Shamokin and burned\r\ntheir own town at that important place.\r\n\r\nTwo of Colonel Weiser’s sons, Frederick and Peter, had been at Shamokin\r\nseveral days previously, then stopped at the house of George Gabriel, at\r\nthe mouth of Penn’s Creek about the head of the Isle of Que, near the\r\npresent town of Selinsgrove. While there a messenger arrived from Logan,\r\none of Shikellamy’s sons and Lapacpicton, a friendly Delaware, who\r\nbrought the alarming news that a large body of French and Indians was\r\napproaching by way of the West Branch.\r\n\r\nThe Provincial Government had been warned that a band of Indians had\r\nleft the West on an expedition to the forks of the Susquehanna, but paid\r\nno heed until too late.\r\n\r\nThese Indians crossed the Allegheny Mountains, through the headwaters of\r\nthe Otzinachson, now called West Branch, near Clearfield, thence through\r\nthe “Great Plains,” now known as Penn’s Valley, Center County, through\r\nthe gaps of Penn’s Creek, in Paddy Mountains, where they struck the\r\nwhite settlements along the creek, commencing at the present town of New\r\nBerlin and down the stream for about a mile in what is now Snyder\r\nCounty.\r\n\r\nOctober 16, 1755, occurred the terrible massacre at Penn’s Creek, when\r\nfifteen persons were cruelly murdered and their bodies terribly mangled\r\nand ten others were carried away as Indian prisoners.\r\n\r\nOf the twenty-five victims, one man, who was wounded, was able to reach\r\nGabriel’s with the news of the massacre.\r\n\r\nWhen the party went out to bury the dead they found thirteen bodies of\r\nmen and elderly women, and one child, two weeks old.\r\n\r\nThe house of Jacob Le Roy, where the massacre was ended, was burned and\r\nhis body lying just by it. He lay on his back, barbarously burnt and two\r\ntomahawks sticking in his forehead.\r\n\r\nThe conditions in the immediate neighborhood of Penn’s Creek beggared\r\ndescription. Conrad Weiser wrote to Governor Morris, upon the arrival of\r\nhis sons, advising of the massacre, and gave him the news of the\r\nintended invasion. But John Harris rushed to the rescue of those in\r\ndistress, and, with a company of forty-six men from Paxtang, arrived at\r\nthe mouth of Penn’s Creek. He found the dead had been buried, and\r\nproceeded to Shamokin to learn the attitude of the Indians there.\r\n\r\nIn the Pennsylvania archives is to be found the examination of Barbara\r\nLeininger and Mary Le Roy, taken after their return from captivity. They\r\ntestified that the others carried away captives at Penn’s Creek were\r\nJacob Le Roy, Rachel Leininger, brother and sister of the testators;\r\nMarian Wheeler; Hannah, wife of Jacob Breylinger and two of their\r\nchildren, one of whom died of starvation, while they were being held at\r\nKittanning; Peter Lick and two sons, John and William.\r\n\r\nThey named the principal Indians and gave a detailed narrative of their\r\njourney and captivity.\r\n\r\nThey were carried to Kittanning, where they were held prisoners until\r\nColonel John Armstrong destroyed the town, September 8, 1756, when the\r\nIndians who had these prisoners in charge made their escape.\r\n\r\nThey were carried to Fort Duquesne and were then led twenty-five miles\r\nlower down the river to the mouth of Big Beaver Creek. In the spring of\r\n1757 they were taken to Kuskusky, twenty-five miles up Big Beaver Creek,\r\nwhere they remained until the Indians learned that the English were\r\nmarching against Fort Duquesne, when the Indians evacuated Kuskusky and\r\nhurried their prisoners on a forced march to the Muskingum, in the\r\npresent State of Ohio.\r\n\r\nMarch 16, 1759, the testators made their escape and were able to reach\r\nFort Pitt fifteen days later. They reached their relatives subsequently,\r\nand were in Philadelphia, May 6, 1759, when they gave their testimony.\r\n\r\nAnn M. LeRoy was residing in Lancaster in 1764, when she again made an\r\naffidavit in regards to the details of her capture and the visits of the\r\nsupposed friendly Conestoga Indians at Kittanning.\r\n\r\nA beautiful boulder with bronze tablet was unveiled at the site of this\r\nmassacre, October, 1915. This can be seen above the bridge over Penn’s\r\nCreek, on the Susquehanna Trail, leading from Selinsgrove to Sunbury. It\r\nmarks the scene of one of the most horrible of the Indian massacres in\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Railroad from Williamsport to Lake Erie\r\n                       Completed October 17, 1864\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the administration of Governor James Pollock the Main Line of\r\npublic works had been sold by virtue of the act of Assembly of May 16,\r\n1857. Governor Pollock had very strongly urged the sale of the public\r\nworks, as they had become a running sore of corruption, including\r\npolitical debauchery and the systematic plunder of the treasury.\r\n\r\nOn June 25 following the Governor closed the transaction by which the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad Company, July 31, assumed ownership of the whole\r\nline of public works between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, the\r\nconsideration being $7,500,000.\r\n\r\nFollowing that sale measures were taken for the disposal of the\r\nremainder of the public improvement. They had failed to be a source of\r\nrevenue to the State, and the application of the proceeds to the payment\r\nof the debt of the Commonwealth soon led to the removal of taxation by\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nWith the disposal of the Main Line of public works, there were left not\r\na few local canals, such as the North Branch, West Branch and others, to\r\nbe managed by the Board of Canal Commissioners. This was a sore point,\r\nand there was a very general desire that these should also be disposed\r\nof and the State entirely divested of its interests in transportation\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nThe Sunbury and Erie Railroad Company was chartered April 3, 1837. The\r\nroad was opened between Williamsport and Milton, December 18, 1854, and\r\nbetween Milton and Northumberland, September 24, 1855.\r\n\r\nThe railroad bridges over the North Branch at Northumberland were\r\ncompleted for traffic January 7, 1856, which opened the road from\r\nWilliamsport to Sunbury. From this time it became a long struggle to\r\ncomplete the line from Williamsport to Erie, which was to be the western\r\nterminus.\r\n\r\nBorough councils and prominent citizens subscribed for stock, and\r\nvarious attempts were made to construct the road, but each new\r\norganization only repeated the story of failure.\r\n\r\nA number of very able and experienced railway men and the directors\r\nconceived the idea of virtually borrowing the credit of the State,\r\nwithout imposing any liability upon the Commonwealth, to aid in the\r\nconstruction of this road.\r\n\r\nTheir proposition was that the various canals remaining in the ownership\r\nof the State should be sold to the Sunbury and Erie Railway Company for\r\n$3,000,000, giving the railway company the right to sell or mortgage the\r\nseveral canals as might be deemed best, the proceeds to be applied to\r\nthe construction of the Erie line, and the State to accept a mortgage\r\nupon the line for the $3,000,000 to be paid for the canals. It was\r\nbelieved this would provide sufficient funds to complete the line, and\r\nwhen this was accomplished the mortgage held by the State would be\r\nabundant security against loss to the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nA bill to enable this sale of the canals was read in place in both House\r\nand Senate and an earnest battle ensued as the members of the canal\r\nboard were not willing to be shorn of their immense powers, which would\r\nresult if the State sold the canals.\r\n\r\nThe Republicans in the House supported the bill; the personnel of the\r\ncanal board was entirely Democratic. No community in the State would\r\nbenefit more by the completion of the link from Williamsport to Erie\r\nthan would Philadelphia, and the great interests of that city soon\r\nbrought a solid support in both House and Senate in favor of the bill.\r\n\r\nMany Democrats whose districts were traversed by the proposed road also\r\nfell into line, so that in spite of desperate opposition, the bill\r\nfinally passed the House by a decided majority, and gained the narrow\r\nmargin of one vote in the Senate.\r\n\r\nGovernor William F. Packer was a resident of Williamsport, and, of\r\ncourse, was intensely interested in the measure.\r\n\r\nThe bill reached the Governor only three days before final adjournment,\r\nand when he examined it, the Governor discovered a vital error in\r\nphraseology which had been overlooked, but which would result in serious\r\nembarrassment in executing its provisions. He could not return it with\r\nhis objections, as it could not be passed over the veto; there was not\r\ntime for the passage of a new bill, and the bill could be amended in the\r\nhands of the Governor only by the adoption of a joint resolution\r\ninstructing such change.\r\n\r\nA joint resolution was required to lay over a day under the rules and it\r\nrequired two-thirds vote to suspend the rule, while the delay of a day\r\nwould be fatal.\r\n\r\nThe matter was submitted to Speaker Longnecker, who presided with\r\nability and dignity over the body, and he informed those who were\r\nconferring with him that a joint resolution could not be read and\r\nfinally passed on the same day.\r\n\r\nAmong the prominent Democratic members was George Nelson Smith, of\r\nCambria County, a thorough parliamentarian and one of the most popular\r\nmembers of the House.\r\n\r\nIt was suggested to the Speaker that he call Smith to the chair. The\r\nSpeaker consented, Smith took the gavel and the resolution to amend the\r\nbill was changed from the usual form of a joint resolution by saying,\r\n“Resolved, If the Senate concurs, etc.,” giving the appearance of a\r\nHouse resolution requiring simply the concurrence of the Senate.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was read the point was raised that it was a joint\r\nresolution and must lie over for a day, but Smith faced the emergency\r\nwith magnificent boldness, deciding that it was not a joint resolution\r\nand directing the final vote to be called.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that a majority of the House meant to save the bill;\r\ntactics for delay would be defeated by previous question and by the\r\naggressive action of Acting Speaker Smith the House was suddenly brought\r\nto a call of the yeas and nays and the bill was saved. The Senate had\r\nample time for concurrence and it was given.\r\n\r\nEven after giving the Sunbury and Erie Railway Company the benefit of\r\nthe loan of $3,000,000 the work was pushed forward under many\r\nembarrassments. It was on the verge of collapse in the general\r\nprostrations of 1860, but the Legislature came to its relief by an\r\nextension of credit.\r\n\r\nThe Civil War came with its quickening of business and large increase of\r\ncirculating medium, and the great enterprise of building a railroad\r\nthrough an almost continued wilderness from Williamsport to Lake Erie, a\r\ndistance of nearly 250 miles, was completed October 17, 1864, and the\r\nState gained not only by the sale of its canals and the abolishment of\r\nthe Canal Board, but the $3,000,000 was abundantly secured to it.\r\n\r\nThe new railroad brought multiplied wealth to the State and the people\r\nthat could never have been realized excepting by the construction of a\r\ngreat railway through the boundless riches of that great region.\r\n\r\nThe name Sunbury and Erie was changed to the Philadelphia and Erie\r\nRailroad Company by Act of Assembly March 7, 1861.\r\n\r\nOn January 1, 1862, it was leased to the Pennsylvania Railroad Company\r\nfor 999 years.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  None Escaped in Massacre at Mahanoy\r\n                        Creek, October 18, 1755\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing the defeat of General Edward Braddock, July 9, 1755, the\r\nsavages roamed at will through the frontier settlements of Pennsylvania.\r\nThey now realized the English were no longer invincible and became\r\nbolder and more terrible in their predatory warfare.\r\n\r\nThe first outbreak was at Penn’s Creek, in the present Snyder County,\r\nwhere on October 16, they swooped down upon the industrious German\r\nsettlers of that neighborhood and cruelly massacred fifteen and carried\r\naway ten others into captivity.\r\n\r\nThe news of the massacre struck terror in the hearts of the settlers and\r\nall, excepting a very few, fled down the river to the older settlements.\r\n\r\nOnly two days after the Penn’s Creek massacre another occurred only a\r\nshort distance to the eastward, at the mouth of Mahanoy Creek, about\r\nfive miles south of the present city of Sunbury.\r\n\r\nOn this eventful day, October 18, 1755, twenty-five of the inhabitants\r\nwere killed or carried away into captivity, often worse than death.\r\nEvery building of the little settlement was burned, and all the\r\nimprovements destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe difference in the two massacres lies in the fact that one escaped\r\nfrom the murderous savages at Penn’s Creek, who was able to make his way\r\nto George Gabriel’s at the mouth of the creek, where he told the awful\r\nstory in detail. It also happened that two sons of Conrad Weiser were\r\nthere at the time, and they hastened to their home in Berks County.\r\n\r\nSoon the old provincial interpreter had messengers on the way to inform\r\nGovernor Morris of the massacre and the threatened invasion of the Forks\r\nof the Susquehanna by the French and their Indian allies, who were\r\napproaching in great force.\r\n\r\nImmediately the news of the massacre at Penn’s Creek reached Harris’\r\nFerry, and without waiting for advice from the provincial authorities,\r\nJohn Harris, with forty-six inhabitants of the neighborhood, hastened to\r\nthe scene of the disaster, where they found and buried a number of the\r\nmangled bodies of the victims. From this place they proceeded to\r\nShamokin to see the Indians and prevail upon them, if possible, to\r\nremain neutral.\r\n\r\nTheir reception at the Indian village was civil but not cordial, and\r\nthey remained there only till the next morning.\r\n\r\nDuring the night they heard the Indians talking about the English in\r\nunfavorable terms, and soon after they sang a war song and four Indians\r\nwent away in the darkness in two canoes. They were well armed. One canoe\r\nwent down stream, the other across the river.\r\n\r\nIn the morning they made a few presents to the Indians. Before their\r\ndeparture they were privately warned by Andrew Montour not to take a\r\ncertain road on the western side of the river, but to continue down the\r\neastern side.\r\n\r\nThey, however, disregarded his warning, either relying on the good faith\r\nof the Indians, or suspecting that Montour intended to lead them into an\r\nambuscade, and they crossed the river and started to march along the\r\nflats on the western shore.\r\n\r\nHardly had they got started on their march until they were fired upon by\r\nsome Indians who lay in ambush, and four were killed, four drowned and\r\nthe rest put to flight.\r\n\r\nJohn Harris, under date of “Paxtang, ye 28th October, 1755,” wrote to\r\nthe Governor an account of the foregoing expedition, and how near they\r\nall came to suffer through Indian treachery. Among other things, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“This is to acquaint you, that on the 24th of October, I arrived at\r\nShamokin, in order to protect our frontiers up that way till they might\r\nmake their escape from their cruel enemies, and learn the best\r\nintelligence I could.\r\n\r\n“The Indians on the West Branch certainly killed our inhabitants on\r\nPenn’s Creek, and there are a hatchet and two English scalps sent them\r\nup to North Branch, to desire them to strike with them if they are men.”\r\n\r\nHe then described the situation and warned the Governor that the Indians\r\nentertained serious designs upon the settlers in and about the Forks of\r\nthe Susquehanna. He then wrote:\r\n\r\n“Montour knew many days ago of the enemy being on their march against us\r\nbefore he informed, for which I said as much to him as I thought\r\nprudent, considering the place I was in.\r\n\r\n“On the 25th inst., on my return with about forty men, we were attacked\r\nby about twenty or thirty Indians, received their fire, and about\r\nfifteen of our men and myself took to the trees, attacked the villains,\r\nkilled four of them on the spot and lost but three more, retreating\r\nabout half a mile through the woods, and crossing the Susquehanna, one\r\nof whom was shot off a horse riding behind myself, through the river. My\r\nhorse was wounded, and falling into the river, I was obliged to quit him\r\nand swim part of the way.\r\n\r\n“Four or five of our men were drowned crossing the river. I hope our\r\njourney, though with fatigue and loss of our substance and some of our\r\nlives, will be of service to our country by discovering our enemy, who\r\nwill be our ruin, if not timely prevented.\r\n\r\n“I just now received information that there was a French officer,\r\nsupposed captain, with a party of Shawnee, Delaware, etc., within six\r\nmiles of Shamokin, ten days ago, and no doubt intends to take possession\r\nof it which will be a dreadful consequence to us, if suffered.”\r\n\r\nHarris then told of his knowledge of the Indians who had made the attack\r\non Penn’s Creek; of an intended attack on Shamokin and other places. He\r\nconcluded his long and informative letter: “I expect Montour and\r\nMonacatootha down here this week, with the determination of their\r\nShamokin council. The inhabitants are abandoning their plantations and\r\nwe are in a dreadful situation.”\r\n\r\nThe postscript to his interesting letter was as follows: “The night\r\nensuing our attack the Indians burned all George Gabriel’s houses;\r\ndanced around them.”\r\n\r\nThe person who was shot off the horse, while riding behind John Harris\r\nin crossing the river, was a physician of Paxtang, who had accompanied\r\nthe party in his professional capacity.\r\n\r\nOn the following day John Harris wrote a letter to Edward Shippen, at\r\nLancaster, in which he expressed fear that the Indians would attack them\r\nany day. He wrote: “I have this day cut loopholes in my house, and am\r\ndetermined to hold out to the last extremity, if I can get some men to\r\nstand by me. But few can be had at present, as every one is in fear of\r\nhis own family being cut off every hour.”\r\n\r\nHarris advised the immediate building of a fort at the Forks of the\r\nSusquehanna. The situation in the Province even as close to Philadelphia\r\nas Harrisburg was truly desperate.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                General Edward Hand Starts on Expedition\r\n                  from Fort Pitt to Wheeling, October\r\n                                19,1777\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1776 and the following spring the agents of Great\r\nBritain had been very active in organizing Indian uprisings along the\r\nfrontiers as a part of the general campaign for the subjugation of the\r\nrebellious colonists.\r\n\r\nContinental Congress decided to take charge of the defense of the\r\ncolonists, especially those in the western part of the State, where the\r\nIndians had been more active and where the settlers had been afforded\r\nless protection from the State and Colonial governments.\r\n\r\nThe first move by Congress was a decision to take Fort Pitt under its\r\ncare and provide an adequate garrison at the Continental expense. The\r\noffer was accepted by Virginia, which colony then claimed the western\r\npart of Pennsylvania as its territory, and Captain John Neville was\r\ndirected to transfer the fort to the United States officer appointed to\r\nits command.\r\n\r\nGeneral Washington selected Brigadier General Edward Hand, of Lancaster,\r\nfor this important service. The brave and efficient work of this\r\ndistinguished officer led the commander-in-chief to believe that he\r\nwould be an able defender of the border, but fighting British and\r\nHessians along the seaboard and Indians in the woods are two quite\r\ndifferent propositions, as General Hand soon discovered.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hand was no stranger at Fort Pitt, but during his former service\r\nthere he had no experience in fighting Indians.\r\n\r\nHe was a native of Ireland and educated to be a physician. At the age of\r\ntwenty-three years he was commissioned as assistant surgeon in the\r\nEighteenth Regiment of Foot, known as the Royal Irish, and in the spring\r\nof 1767 he accompanied the command to America.\r\n\r\nHe was stationed for a time in the Illinois country and afterward at\r\nFort Pitt. In 1774 he resigned his commission and took up the practice\r\nof medicine in Lancaster, Pa.\r\n\r\nSoon after the news of Lexington and Concord he interested himself in\r\nraising troops for the cause of the colonists and was commissioned\r\nlieutenant-colonel of Thompson’s celebrated regiment of Pennsylvania\r\nriflemen, afterward the First Regiment of the Pennsylvania Line.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1776, Hand succeeded as colonel and under his command the\r\nregiment did gallant work in the battles of Long Island, Trenton and\r\nPrinceton.\r\n\r\nOn April 1, 1777, Hand was rewarded for his really exceptional services\r\nby promotion to the rank of brigadier general and soon thereafter\r\nGeneral Washington further evinced his appreciation and confidence by\r\nassigning General Hand, then only thirty-three years old, to the defense\r\nof the western frontier.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hand arrived at Fort Pitt Sunday, June 1, 1777, and took over\r\nthe property from Captain Neville. He led no forces across the\r\nmountains, being accompanied by only a few officers.\r\n\r\nThe garrison consisted of but two companies of the Thirteenth Virginia,\r\nrecruited in and about Pittsburgh, and they were shy of discipline. The\r\nlarger part of these soldiers had been with Washington in New Jersey.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hand, in the East, had engaged in warfare where it was never\r\ndifficult to locate the enemy, in large bodies, ready to stand up and\r\nfight. In that warfare the colonists did most of the dodging and were\r\nthe hardest to find.\r\n\r\nOn the frontier the conditions were reversed, the enemy could not be\r\nfound yet was ever present. The savages, in small bands, entered the\r\nsettlements and struck quick but terrible blows, then fled by night into\r\nthe dense forests.\r\n\r\nThe only evidence of the presence of these savages were the dead bodies\r\nof the victims and ashes of their former cabins, but they left no trail\r\nthat a white man could discover. The problem was perplexing to General\r\nHand.\r\n\r\nMany murders had been committed before General Hand’s arrival, but they\r\nbecame more numerous.\r\n\r\nThe British commandant, Colonel Henry Hamilton, at Detroit, began about\r\nJune 1 to equip and send out war parties to attack the settlements of\r\nKentucky, Virginia and Pennsylvania, which parties consisted mostly of\r\nIndians of the Wyandotte and Miami tribes of Northern Ohio and Shawnee\r\nof Southern Ohio and a few British officers.\r\n\r\nAt the same time parties of Seneca invaded the Pennsylvania settlements\r\nfrom Western New York.\r\n\r\nBeside the bodies of many victims of the raids were found copies of the\r\nproclamation by Hamilton, offering protection and reward to all settlers\r\nwho would make their way to any of the British posts and join the cause\r\nof the King.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hand soon determined that the one way to fight Indians was to\r\ninvade their own country and destroy their towns and provisions. The\r\nOhio tribes had permanent villages and grew great crops of corn, beans\r\nand pumpkins, which they stored in earth silos. If the Indians lost\r\ntheir crops they would be driven to hunt in the winter and could have no\r\ntime for the warpath.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hand decided to descend the Ohio with a large force of\r\nmilitiamen to the mouth of the Big Kanawha and to march thence overland\r\nagainst the Shawnee towns.\r\n\r\nHand appealed to all the militia commanders of Westmoreland and Bedford\r\nCounties in Pennsylvania, and of all the frontier counties of Virginia,\r\nto muster men for the expedition.\r\n\r\nHe also appealed to the governments of both States and they directed\r\ntheir officers to respond to the calls. The project was even indorsed by\r\nCongress; yet in spite of all these efforts the expedition was a\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hand expected 500 men from the two Pennsylvania counties and\r\n1500 men from Virginia. His expectations were unreasonable in that he\r\ndid not take into consideration the drained and distressed condition of\r\nthe border. Already the hardiest and most useful men had gone to fight\r\nthe British. Most of those who remained on the plantations believed they\r\nwere needed at home to protect their families from the raids of the\r\nsavages.\r\n\r\nNo men responded from Bedford County and only 100 from Westmoreland,\r\nunder command of Colonel Lochry, reached Fort Pitt.\r\n\r\nOn October 19, 1777, General Hand left Fort Pitt and went down the river\r\nto Wheeling, where he expected to meet the recruits from Virginia. After\r\na week of waiting only a few poorly equipped squads reported to him.\r\nHand gave up in disgust and returned to Fort Pitt.\r\n\r\nThe following spring he requested to be recalled from the frontier\r\nservice, and General Washington called him to his army May 26, 1778.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Great Meeting in the Interest of Inland\r\n                     Waterways Held at Harrisburg,\r\n                            October 20, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of the year 1789, the President and members of\r\nthe Supreme Executive Council appointed a commission to view the\r\nDelaware, Schuylkill and Susquehanna Rivers, in pursuance of an act of\r\nAssembly passed September 28, 1789, with the object of ascertaining data\r\nwhether or not these waters could be rendered navigable.\r\n\r\nThis commission, composed of Timothy Matlack, Reading Howell, William\r\nDean, John Adlum and Benjamin Rittenhouse, attended to the important\r\nduty assigned them and in their report strongly recommended that a\r\ncommission of experienced surveyors be named for “the purpose of\r\nascertaining the most convenient and practicable place for connecting\r\nthe waters of the three rivers, with those of the Allegheny, Lake\r\nOntario and Lake Erie. And in cases where portage by land will be\r\nnecessary, to examine the face of the country and report the most\r\nsuitable places for landings and roads.”\r\n\r\nA great meeting was held at Paxtang, October 20, 1789, which was\r\nattended by citizens of eight counties, when an organization was\r\naffected with James Ewing, of York County, as chairman. Committees were\r\nnamed for each county to solicit subscriptions for the furtherance of\r\nthese surveys, and a commission was appointed, consisting of Frederic\r\nAntes, of Northumberland County; John Brattan, of Huntingdon; Andrew\r\nGalbraith, of Cumberland, and Sebastian Graff and John Haldeman, of\r\nLancaster, to superintend the work of removing obstructions in the\r\nSusquehanna and Juniata rivers.\r\n\r\nA resolution was adopted which authorized the appointment of three\r\nsurveyors, to begin at the mouth of the Juniata and proceed up the\r\nSusquehanna to Sunbury, thence up the West Branch to Sinnemahoning\r\nCreek, thence to Canoe Place, or such place “as will connect most easily\r\nwith any practicable branch of the Allegheny, the Consua, Toby’s Creek,\r\nor any other which may discharge itself into the Allegheny nearest to\r\nthe mouth of French Creek, and thence examine French Creek up to Le\r\nBoeuf and the portage to Presqu’ Isle.”\r\n\r\nTimothy Matlack, John Adlum, Samuel Maclay, Reading Howell, Frederick\r\nAntes, and William Dean were appointed April 6, and commissioned and\r\nqualified April 9, 1790.\r\n\r\nThe three first mentioned set out on the work along the Susquehanna and\r\nthe others took up the work on the lower Susquehanna and Schuylkill.\r\n\r\nSamuel Maclay kept an interesting journal of the experiences of the\r\ncommission, from which the following is taken.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Matlack and Adlum set out from Philadelphia May 6, and met\r\nMaclay at Lebanon. They remained there nearly a week, and began their\r\nwork when they set out from the Swatara, having taken James McLaughlin,\r\nEdward Sweeney, and Matthew Gray into the pay of the State.\r\n\r\nThe party reached Herold’s, below Selinsgrove, by May 17, then proceeded\r\nto Northumberland. Here Maclay went to visit his family at now\r\nLewisburg. John Adlum visited with his friend Colonel Frederic Antes,\r\nand Timothy Matlack was the guest of Colonel William Wilson, of\r\nNorthumberland.\r\n\r\nThe party was organized during this stay at Northumberland and proceeded\r\nup the West Branch to the mouth of the Loyalsock. They next encamped on\r\nthe Great Island, then reached the Sinnemahoning, where they built\r\nseveral canoes.\r\n\r\nThe actual survey began at Canoe Place, where Adlum ran a line to the\r\nAllegheny. He writes in his journal of catching beaver, and of the large\r\nnumbers of “wolves which frequently crossed their track, in a very\r\nindifferent manner.”\r\n\r\nJune 14, they surveyed the West Branch of the Sinnemahoning as far as\r\nBoyd’s quarry, the following day reached Bennett’s.\r\n\r\nOn July 2, the party reached the Ohio River, and went down it, being\r\nguided by an Indian, named Doctor Thomas.\r\n\r\nWhen the western boundary of the State was reached, Conne Shangom, the\r\nchief, had gone to Venango, but another chief, Captain John, made the\r\ncommissioners a speech of welcome. At this place they came across a\r\nDutchman, who had been taken prisoner by the Indians in the last war,\r\nbut who chose to continue to live with them.\r\n\r\nOn July 7, the commissioners had an interesting interview with the\r\ncelebrated Indian Chieftain, Cornplanter, at Jenoshawdego.\r\n\r\nMaclay records that the Indians were very jealous of them until they\r\nwere made to fully understand their mission. Cornplanter then welcomed\r\nthem with a speech. Maclay says, “we were addressed by an orator, on\r\nbehalf of the women.” This speech of Cornplanter’s was responded to by\r\nColonel Matlack.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners then went to Cornplanter’s town and “had the honor of\r\nhis company for supper.”\r\n\r\nJuly 14, they struck the old French road to Erie. Maclay records that\r\n“the cart ruts are quite plain yet.” He further records, “Lake Erie is a\r\nfresh water sea. You can see the horizon and water meet.”\r\n\r\nThe party was here caught in a terrible storm and thoroughly drenched.\r\n\r\nThe party pushed down the Allegheny a distance of eighty miles, and\r\nSunday morning, July 18, they met Mr. Adlum and his party. Adlum\r\nfinished a survey the next day, and the entire party was again united at\r\nBuckaloon, or Brokenstraw, about five miles from the present town of\r\nWarren.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th the party arrived at Fort Franklin, where the commanding\r\nofficer, Lieutenant Jeffries, was very polite to them.\r\n\r\nTwo days later Maclay records, “we paired off and discharged an old\r\nIndian chief and a white savage.” The commissioners left Fort Franklin\r\nthis day, and reached David Meads, at present Meadville. They then went\r\nto Le Boeuf, and from there back to Fort Franklin, where they arrived\r\nAugust 1.\r\n\r\nMaclay writes about using some oil, collected from a small oil spring\r\nalong French Creek, on his lame back. The effect was beneficial.\r\n\r\nThe survey of the Allegheny River began at this point, and they also\r\nexplored the tributary streams all the way down that river to the\r\nConemaugh, then to Frankstown, on the Juniata River, where they arrived\r\nSeptember 8.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners proceeded down the Juniata to the Susquehanna. Samuel\r\nMaclay notes that he arrived at his home Friday, September 17, and found\r\nhis family all well and at dinner.\r\n\r\nThe report was made as three different surveys, and the cost £561, 27s.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Bicentennial Opened in Chester and Philadelphia,\r\n                            October 21, 1882\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the close of Governor John F. Hartranft’s second term the Republicans\r\nnominated General Henry Martyn Hoyt, of Wilkes-Barre, while the\r\nDemocrats had as their standard-bearer Honorable Andrew H. Dill, of\r\nLewisburg.\r\n\r\nThe campaign was conducted along the line of national issues, the\r\nleading discussion being the resumption of specie payments. This became\r\nthe keynote of the campaign and Hoyt was elected by a large majority.\r\n\r\nAn interesting historical event occurred before the end of Hartranft’s\r\nadministration, on December 19, 1878, when Bayard Taylor died in the\r\ncity of Berlin, Germany, while serving at his post as Minister to\r\nGermany. He was a native of Chester County and through his literary\r\nworks had done much to increase the fame of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nAfter Governor Hartranft retired from the office of Governor he removed\r\nto Philadelphia, where he served as Postmaster of the city, and\r\nafterward as Collector of the Port.\r\n\r\nHis love for the National Guard continued and he was the commanding\r\ngeneral from 1879 until his death on October 17, 1889. His memory as a\r\nsoldier is perpetuated by an equestrian statue on the plaza of the\r\nCapitol at Harrisburg and by a beautiful monument in the cemetery at\r\nNorristown.\r\n\r\nGovernor Hoyt was inaugurated on January 21, 1879, being the first such\r\nceremony held under the provisions of the new Constitution of 1874, and\r\non January 7, following, the Legislature met in biennial session for the\r\nfirst time, as provided in the new Constitution.\r\n\r\nOn May 16, 1881, the Legislature adopted a joint resolution, which had\r\nfor its purpose the reinterment of William Penn in the City of\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\nGeorge L. Harrison, Esq., of Philadelphia, at his own expense, carried\r\nthe Governor’s request to the legal representatives of William Penn, and\r\ntrustees of Jordan’s Meeting House, England, but after some deliberation\r\nthey refused to grant the request.\r\n\r\nHad this been granted the body of the founder and former Proprietor of\r\nPennsylvania would have been resting in Pennsylvania soil at the time\r\nthe bicentennial of Penn’s arrival in the Province was observed with\r\nfitting ceremonies in October, 1882.\r\n\r\nThis great celebration was held in Chester and Philadelphia, beginning\r\nwith appropriate religious services on Sunday, October 21. “Landing Day”\r\nwas observed at Chester on Monday, the following day was known as\r\n“Landing Day” in Philadelphia, when the “Welcome” arrived at the foot of\r\nDock Street, where the landing scenes of the previous day were again\r\nre-enacted, with Quakers, Swedes and Indians in the large cast.\r\n\r\nThe parade up Dock Street passed a stand, where Governor Hoyt, Alexander\r\nP. Colesberry, president Bi-Centennial Association Committee, and other\r\nmembers of the committee and distinguished guests reviewed the pageant.\r\nHere the character of William Penn made a speech, to which Tamanend,\r\nsachem of the Delaware Nation, made reply.\r\n\r\nThe great celebration ended on Friday with a grand military parade under\r\ncommand of General John F. Hartranft. This was a fitting and impressive\r\nobservance in which the 200 years of history were recalled in tableaux,\r\nstory, music, pageantry and parade.\r\n\r\nThe Republican Party received its first setback in a State campaign in\r\n1882, when Robert E. Pattison, of Philadelphia, defeated General James\r\nA. Beaver, of Bellefonte, in a spirited contest.\r\n\r\nThe campaign disclosed the fact that there were too many members of the\r\nRepublican Party dissatisfied with the conditions in their organization.\r\nThe disaffected united in an independent movement and nominated John\r\nStewart, of Chambersburg, afterward a Justice of the Supreme Court, as\r\ntheir candidate for Governor.\r\n\r\nThe Greenback-Labor Party also placed a candidate in the field in the\r\nperson of Thomas A. Armstrong. The Prohibition candidate was Alfred C.\r\nPetit. Mr. Pattison easily overcame the normal Republican majority on\r\naccount of the divided vote and was elected by more than 40,000\r\nplurality.\r\n\r\nGovernor Pattison was inaugurated January 16, 1883, at the age of\r\nthirty-two years. He was of the opinion that the State should be\r\nredistricted in congressional, senatorial and representative districts,\r\nas required by the Constitution, and when the Legislature adjourned\r\nwithout passing the necessary legislation, the Governor issued a\r\nproclamation on the day fixed for final adjournment, June 6, 1883, and\r\ncalled an extra session to convene the following day.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature continued in session until December 6, and reapportioned\r\nthe State into judicial districts, but the efforts in behalf of new\r\ndistricts for Congress and the Legislature proved unavailing.\r\n\r\nThe act creating the annual observance of Arbor Day was enacted on March\r\n17, 1885, and Governor Pattison appointed April 16 of that year as the\r\nfirst Arbor Day in Pennsylvania, a custom which has been followed to the\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\nIn 1886 four candidates were placed in the field for the office of\r\nGovernor. The Republicans again nominated General James A. Beaver and\r\nthe Democrats named Chauncey F. Black, of York. The Prohibitionists\r\nselected Charles S. Wolf, of Lewisburg, and the Greenback Party named\r\nRobert J. Houston.\r\n\r\nThe Republicans presented a solid front this time and easily elected\r\nGeneral Beaver, who was inaugurated January 18, 1887.\r\n\r\nIn the first session of the General Assembly the State was divided into\r\ntwenty-eight congressional districts and 204 legislative districts.\r\n\r\nAn amendment to the Constitution, proposing to “prohibit the\r\nmanufacture, sale or keeping for sale of any intoxicating liquor to be\r\nused as a beverage” was defeated by the vote of the people almost two to\r\none. This amendment was strongly urged by Governor Beaver.\r\n\r\nAn important movement was put into action by the Governor, himself a\r\ngallant veteran of the Civil War, when by the act of the Legislature\r\nmemorial tablets were erected on the battlefield of Gettysburg. These\r\ntablets were dedicated on Pennsylvania Day, September 11–12, 1889.\r\n\r\nAn interesting historical event was the centennial anniversary of the\r\nadoption of the Federal Constitution, which was observed in Philadelphia\r\nSeptember 15, 16 and 17, 1887. The Constitutional Centennial Commission\r\narranged a civic and industrial procession, military parade and memorial\r\nceremonies in a manner reflecting great honor and credit to all\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Daniel Boone, Pioneer Kentucky Frontiersman,\r\n                      Born in Berks County October\r\n                                22, 1733\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest of American romances is written about the character\r\nand thrilling experiences of Daniel Boone, who forsook the quiet and\r\nuneventful life of a Quaker, turned his back on the civilization of his\r\nnative State, deserted his farm in North Carolina and went in search of\r\nadventure in the wilderness of Kentucky.\r\n\r\nGeorge Boone, III, sailed from England with his wife and three of their\r\nnine children, August 17, 1717, and landed in Philadelphia, October 10.\r\nThis family resided for a short time at Abington, then for two years at\r\nNorth Wales. They belonged to the sect of Quakers and were members of\r\nthe Gwynedd Meeting.\r\n\r\nGeorge Boone, next settled at Oley, then in Philadelphia County, but\r\nlater, a part of Exeter Township, Berks County; named Exeter when Berks\r\nCounty was erected in honor of the Boone home in England. Here George\r\nBoone built a log house, in 1720, situated seven miles east of Reading.\r\nIt is still standing, and is one of the priceless relics of old Berks\r\nCounty.\r\n\r\nThe third son of George and Mary Maugridge Boone was Squire Boone, the\r\nfather of Daniel Boone, who was born on another farm in the same\r\nneighborhood, on October 22, 1733.\r\n\r\nDaniel left Berks County with his parents for North Carolina in 1750, at\r\nthe age of seventeen years. They seated themselves in Yadkin River\r\nValley, and young Boone soon became the most expert woodsman and hunter\r\nin that section of the State. In 1755 Daniel married Rebecca Bryan, the\r\nprettiest girl in the neighborhood, and they were happy in their new log\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nThe settlers became too numerous and soon the hunting was more difficult\r\nand longer trips necessary. Daniel grew restless, and about that time he\r\nwas attracted by the tales of John Finley, an experienced Indian trader\r\nand adventurer, about the country beyond the mountains, known as\r\nKentucky.\r\n\r\nBoone then gathered together five companions and set out on a hunting\r\nand exploration trip. After a long, weary march they reached the heights\r\noverlooking the plains of Central Kentucky, and observed the huge herds\r\nof buffalo and deer, and felt amply rewarded for the hardships endured\r\nin getting there.\r\n\r\nThey erected a cabin and passed a happy and busy summer hunting and\r\nexploring. A few days before Christmas the camp was broken up through\r\nthe capture of Boone and a companion while out hunting. They were\r\nsuddenly surprised by fifteen Indians and taken prisoners.\r\n\r\nBoone and his companion made their captors believe they were happy in\r\ntheir experience and promptly accepted the Indian manner of doing\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the night Boone awakened his companion, grabbed their\r\nrifles and escaped.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at their cabin it was deserted. The two men realized\r\nthey were the only white men west of the mountains, but they remained\r\nand resumed their hunting.\r\n\r\nSome days later Squire Boone, a brother of Daniel, and a friend, arrived\r\nat Daniel’s camp. The neighbor who accompanied Squire soon grew homesick\r\nand returned to North Carolina. Boone’s other companion was killed by\r\nthe Indians, and only the brothers were left alone in that wilderness of\r\nKentucky.\r\n\r\nThey hunted all winter, and in the spring Squire tramped back home for a\r\nsupply of powder leaving Daniel alone. Three months later Squire\r\nreturned with powder, lead, horses and the happy tidings that all was\r\nwell at home.\r\n\r\nThe following spring Daniel and his brother made a trip home. A year\r\nlater he sold his farm and planned to make his home in Kentucky. Several\r\nneighbors decided to join him, and soon five families, forty in all,\r\nwith cattle and household goods, were tramping toward the western\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the men driving the cattle were fired at from ambush and six of\r\nthem killed, one of whom was Daniel Boone’s eldest son. This so saddened\r\nthe emigrants that Daniel Boone led them back to the Clinch River, where\r\nthey remained until 1774.\r\n\r\nDunmore, the Royal Governor of Virginia, employed Boone to rescue a\r\nparty of surveyors, and he made a round trip of 800 miles, to the Falls\r\nof the Ohio and back to Virginia in sixty-two days, bringing the men\r\nback without a mishap.\r\n\r\nOn April 1, 1775, he began the erection of his famous fort on the\r\nKentucky River. It was finished in June and named Boonesborough.\r\n\r\nBoone then returned home, gathered up his family and took them to the\r\nnew home he had prepared. Here they were happy until the Indians began\r\nto make trouble.\r\n\r\nThe day before Christmas one of his men was killed and another wounded.\r\nThe following June, Boone’s young daughter and two girls foolishly\r\ncrossed the river in a boat and were carried away by the Indians.\r\n\r\nBoone and eight companions started in pursuit, and forty miles distant\r\ncame upon them at dinner. The Indians were taken by surprise and fled\r\nwithout their rifles, two being killed on the jump. The girls were\r\nrescued unharmed.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1778 Boone was captured at a salt springs, with\r\nabout thirty of his men. The Indians led them toward Canada, reaching\r\nDetroit in March.\r\n\r\nThe English bought the prisoners, offering a large sum for Boone, but\r\nthe Indians refused it, saying they liked him and wanted to make him one\r\nof their tribe. Boone returned with them, always conducting himself in a\r\ncheerful manner. He was adopted in the tribe as a son of Chief\r\nBlackfish.\r\n\r\nOne evening he learned the Indians planned an attack on Boonesborough.\r\nHe hid food in his shirt and at daybreak started on a hunting trip.\r\nCovering his trail, he set out for home, walking day and night, eating\r\nfew meals during the 160 miles through the woods.\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived he found his wife, believing him dead, had returned to\r\nher father’s home. He assembled his sixty men and prepared for the\r\nattack of 400 Indians.\r\n\r\nThe attack was made, British and Canadians being among the savages under\r\nChief Blackfish. A parley of two days was agreed to, but Boone used the\r\ntime to better protect the fort.\r\n\r\nAfter a fierce fight lasting nine days the Indians gave up and started\r\nhome, leaving behind thirty-seven dead and many wounded. Boone lost two\r\nmen and had four wounded.\r\n\r\nIn 1780 Squire Boone was killed and Daniel had a narrow escape from\r\ncapture.\r\n\r\nIn 1782 Boone was commissioned a lieutenant colonel. One of his sons was\r\nkilled and the other wounded.\r\n\r\nKentucky was admitted as a State February 4, 1791. Boone’s restless\r\nspirit then moved him westward and in 1795 he settled in Missouri. He\r\ndied September 26, 1820, and his body was buried beside his wife, who\r\nhad died seven years before.\r\n\r\nIn 1845 Boone’s remains were re-interred near Frankfort, Ky.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  General Sir Guy Carleton Puts End to\r\n                      Indian War October 23, 1782\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the murder of Colonel William Crawford, which occurred June, 1782,\r\nabout five miles west of Upper Sandusky, the Scots and other\r\nfrontiersmen were saddened but far from being discouraged.\r\n\r\nThe fugitives of the ill-fated expedition to the Sandusky had hardly\r\nreturned to their homes along the western frontier of Pennsylvania when\r\nthey began preparations for another expedition.\r\n\r\nThe borderers possessed a fierce determination to crush out the “red\r\nvipers” and one more trip into the Indian country soon as harvest was\r\ngathered was but an incident in their exciting life.\r\n\r\nGeneral William Irvine, the commandant at Fort Pitt, was urged to\r\ncommand, and principal men of that vicinity agreed to furnish the\r\nprovisions, not only for the volunteers but for the regular troops.\r\n\r\nThe General determined to lead the expedition if he should be satisfied\r\nwith its size and equipment. Men who were too aged for service agreed to\r\nfurnish the horses and provisions.\r\n\r\nIt was intended to start early in August, but the summer had been so dry\r\nthat the mills could not grind until the water was sufficient, so a\r\npostponement was announced until September 20.\r\n\r\nGeneral Irvine kept the State Government advised of the preparations on\r\nthe frontier and at the same time intimated that State and Congress\r\nwould materially assist in the enterprise.\r\n\r\nAfter a conference between members of Congress and the Supreme Executive\r\nCouncil a recommendation was made, September 1, 1782, to General\r\nWashington that the General Government should aid in this campaign\r\nagainst the savages. It was an opportune moment as operations in the\r\nEast were quiet and peace was soon expected with Great Britain.\r\n\r\nGeneral Washington agreed that three expeditions should penetrate the\r\nIndian country, each to be composed of regulars, militia and volunteers,\r\nand Congress voted to bear the expenses of the regular troops.\r\n\r\nBrigadier General Irvine was to command in person the expedition which\r\nwould move from Fort Pitt against the Wyandot and Delaware on the\r\nSandusky River; Major General James Potter, of Northumberland County,\r\nwas to advance from Sunbury into the Seneca land, in the Genesee Valley\r\nof New York State, and a third expedition was to be sent by the State of\r\nNew York against the Eastern Iroquois in the vicinity of Oswego.\r\n\r\nTwo companies of militia, one from York and the other from Cumberland\r\nCounty, were sent to Westmoreland to guard its settlements while its own\r\nmen were absent in the Indian country.\r\n\r\nDetachments of Colonel Moses Hazen’s “Canadian Regiment” stationed at\r\nLancaster and Carlisle were ordered to march to Fort Pitt and there join\r\nGeneral Irvine, who had at that post two companies of the Eighth\r\nPennsylvania regiment, commanded by Captains Samuel Brady and John\r\nClark.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lincoln, Secretary of War, proposed that General Irvine’s force\r\nshould aggregate 1200 men and set October 8 as the date to begin the\r\ncampaign, and assured General Irvine that the additional troops would be\r\nthere by that time.\r\n\r\nWhile preparations were being made the Indians struck a blow against the\r\nborder. Early in September, Captain Andrew Bradt and forty Canadian\r\nRangers and 238 Indians, Wyandot, Delaware and Shawnee, set out from\r\nUpper Sandusky to attack Wheeling.\r\n\r\nFort Henry, at that place, was defended by twenty-seven men, only\r\neighteen of whom were fit for duty. One swivel gun, which had been\r\ndiscarded by the French and thrown into the river when Fort Duquesne was\r\nevacuated in 1758, had been recovered by the pioneers and again set up.\r\n\r\nAll the inhabitants of that neighborhood flocked to the stockade on the\r\nnews of the approach of the enemy. Colonel Ebenezer Zane was in command\r\nof the garrison.\r\n\r\nCaptain Bradt’s force crossed the Ohio and paraded in front of Fort\r\nHenry in the evening of Wednesday, September 11. The captain displayed\r\nthe British flag and demanded a surrender, which was promptly rejected,\r\nand soon firing was opened on the fort from long range.\r\n\r\nAt midnight the savages attempted to carry the fort by storm, but were\r\nrepulsed. The French swivel gun proved to be more than a relic and\r\nrendered a good account of itself, and especially as the Indians were\r\nmuch afraid of any sort of cannon.\r\n\r\nTwo more attempts to gain by storm were made before daybreak, and both\r\nproved futile. The enemy, however, kept up a steady fire during the day.\r\nCaptain Bradt sent a Negro to the fort with a second demand for\r\nsurrender, and during Thursday night a fourth desperate attempt to take\r\nthe fort by storm was made.\r\n\r\nAgain the brave riflemen repulsed the savage horde and broke their\r\nspirit, and they retired and recrossed the Ohio. Only one defender was\r\nwounded in the foot.\r\n\r\nAfter the failure to invest Wheeling, seventy of the Indians who cut\r\nloose from the main force and went for scalps and plunder, attacked the\r\nblockhouse of Abraham Rice, on Buffalo Creek, within the present Donegal\r\nTownship, Washington County.\r\n\r\nSix men in that blockhouse successfully defended it from 2 o’clock in\r\nthe afternoon of September 13 until 2 o’clock the following morning.\r\nThey killed four Indians and lost one of their own number, George\r\nFelebaum, who was shot in the brain while looking through a loophole.\r\n\r\nThe savages killed many cattle and burned the barn. On their return\r\ntoward the Ohio they met and killed two settlers who were going to the\r\nrelief of Rice’s blockhouse. This was the last invasion of Western\r\nPennsylvania by a large body of Indians.\r\n\r\nWhile General Irvine was impatient that Hazen’s regulars did not arrive,\r\non October 23, he received word from Philadelphia that the Indian war\r\nwas at an end and that his expedition was countermanded.\r\n\r\nTo the credit of General Sir Guy Carleton is due the cessation of the\r\nIndian depredations. Soon after his appointment he was shocked by the\r\ncruel burning of Colonel William Crawford and other American prisoners,\r\nand he immediately put an end to the six years of terrible savage\r\nbutchery.\r\n\r\nGeneral Washington learned of General Carleton’s action September 23,\r\nwhen he directed the authorities in Philadelphia to stop General Potter\r\nat Sunbury from marching to Fort Pitt.\r\n\r\nOn September 27 General Lincoln ordered Generals Hazen and Irvine to\r\ncall off the expedition. The former immediately returned with his\r\ncommand to Lancaster. The letter to General Irvine was not promptly\r\ndelivered and Captain Samuel Brady found the bearer at a wayside inn,\r\nand he hurried the intelligence to General Irvine too late.\r\n\r\nBut in the autumn of 1782, the sorely harried frontiersmen were\r\nencouraged to believe their distresses were at an end, and with much joy\r\nthey were able to participate in the first general Thanksgiving Day\r\ncelebrated in the United States on the last Thursday of November.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Susquehanna River First Explored by\r\n                     Etienne Brulé in October, 1615\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo great waters south of Pennsylvania admit ships from Europe, and by\r\nthem white men came. Their first approach was up the Chesapeake.\r\n\r\nCaptain John Smith sailed from the colony of Jamestown, Va., July 24,\r\n1608, on an exploring expedition, and his little craft, bearing thirteen\r\nsouls, was propelled with sail and oar. Even with such a vessel he\r\nexperienced some danger and suffered privations, before he pushed as far\r\nup the “northwest branch” as he could. This, of course, was the\r\nSusquehanna River.\r\n\r\nCaptain Smith first saw the Susquehanna Indians, and he is the one\r\nexplorer who has given us a fine account of the country he visited and\r\nthe people he met.\r\n\r\nTwelve months after Captain Smith’s visit to the head of the Chesapeake,\r\nHenry Hudson, in the “Half Moon,” sailed along the Atlantic Coast and\r\ndiscovered the existence of the Delaware Bay, on August 28, 1609.\r\n\r\nBut neither Captain John Smith nor Henry Hudson entered Pennsylvania.\r\nThey approached or reached the open doorway, but it is not certain\r\neither came inside. The first actual visit of a white man was not made\r\nuntil six years after Hudson’s call at the Capes.\r\n\r\nThe first exploration of the Susquehanna River for its entire length was\r\nmade in the fall, winter and spring of 1615–16 by Etienne (Stephen)\r\nBrulé, a Frenchman in the employ of Samuel Champlain, the first Governor\r\nof New France. He entered Pennsylvania via the North Branch the latter\r\npart of October, 1615.\r\n\r\nA narrative of Brulé's explorations is given by John G. Shea and is to\r\nthe effect that Brulé crossed from Lake Ontario to the headwaters of the\r\nSusquehanna, descended the North Branch, and furnished the Jesuit\r\nFathers with the earliest information we have of the aborigines of that\r\nsection.\r\n\r\nThe glowing description which Brulé gave of these Neuters led Father de\r\nla Roche Daillon to visit them. Brulé must have been among these Indians\r\nas early as 1610, and perhaps earlier. He was one of the first Europeans\r\never to visit the Huron country and acquire a knowledge of their\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nBrulé was a dauntless woodsman, interpreter and guide and seems to have\r\npossessed the requisite quantity of genuine bravado to have done the\r\nthings with which he is credited.\r\n\r\nSeptember 8, 1615, when Champlain was preparing to join the Huron in\r\ntheir expedition against their ancient enemies, the Iroquois, Brulé set\r\nout with a party of twelve Huron from Upper Canada for the town of\r\nCarantouan on the Susquehanna, to obtain their co-operation against the\r\ncommon enemy. The Indians formed part of the confederacy known later as\r\nthe Andastes.\r\n\r\nBrulé, with his little band of Huron, crossed from Lake Ontario to the\r\nSusquehanna, defeated on the way a war-party of Iroquois and entered\r\nCarantouan in triumph.\r\n\r\nThis was that tribe’s principal town and was palisaded. From this town\r\nthey could send out 800 warriors, which would indicate a total\r\npopulation of 4000 souls. Brulé obtained here a force of 500 Carantouan,\r\nand they set out to join Champlain and the Huron; but as they proceeded\r\nslowly, they reached the Iroquoian town only to find that Champlain had\r\nattacked it with his force, had failed, had himself been wounded, and\r\nhad returned to Canada.\r\n\r\nBrulé and his allies returned to Carantouan, and here Brulé remained the\r\nrest of the autumn and winter, “for lack of company and escort home.”\r\n\r\nWhile thus waiting Brulé explored the country and visited tribes\r\nadjacent to that region. He explored along the river “that debouches in\r\nthe direction of Florida,” and left the neighborhood of Oneida, N. Y.,\r\nin the fall of 1615, and descended the Susquehanna River to at least the\r\npresent Pennsylvania-Maryland boundary. This is evidenced by the fact\r\nthat in the report of his journey he refers to meeting with tribes who\r\ncomplained of the harshness of the Dutch.\r\n\r\nCertainly these early settlers had not gone far from the mouth of the\r\ngreat rivers at this early date, even to explore the country. He\r\nreported many warlike nations carrying on wars against each other; the\r\nclimate as very temperate, and great numbers of animals and an abundance\r\nof small game.\r\n\r\nHe continued his course “along the river as far as the sea, and to\r\nislands and lands near them, which are inhabited by various tribes and\r\nlarge numbers of savages, who are well disposed and love the French\r\nabove all nations. But those who know the Dutch complain severely of\r\nthem, since they treat them roughly.”\r\n\r\nWhen he attempted to rejoin his countrymen, his party was attacked and\r\nscattered by the Iroquois and Brulé, losing his way, entered an Iroquois\r\nvillage. He tried to convince them that he was not of the same nation of\r\nwhites who had just been attacking them, but the savages fell upon him,\r\ntore out his nails and beard and began to burn him in different parts of\r\nthe body.\r\n\r\nHe was far from being an exemplary character, but wore an Agnus Dei, and\r\nwhen the Indians went to tear this from his neck he threatened them with\r\nthe vengeance of heaven. Just then a terrible thunderstorm came up, his\r\ntormentors fled in all directions and the chief of the tribe released\r\nBrulé.\r\n\r\nAfter this he spent some time with them. They escorted him on a four\r\ndays’ journey to visit the Huron tribe on Lake Huron.\r\n\r\nHe found Champlain in 1618, and made his report to him. It was\r\napparently on this return trip that he passed through the territory of\r\nthe Neuters, as it would be his safest course.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to record here the ultimate fate of this intrepid\r\nadventurer. In 1623 he was in Quebec, where he was sent to meet and\r\nbring down the Huron coming to trade. He returned with them, leading a\r\nvery dissolute life among the Indians.\r\n\r\nSagard, in his “History of Canada,” says when Kirk took Quebec Brulé\r\ndeserted the French and went over to the English. He was sent up to the\r\nHuron, in 1629, in the interest of the English, notwithstanding the\r\nbitter reproaches of his old commander, Champlain. Sagard further states\r\nthat the traitorous conduct of Brulé provoked the Huron, who put him to\r\ndeath and devoured him.\r\n\r\nThe Jesuits do not mention this fate, but intimate that he met his death\r\nat the town of Toanchain, about one mile from Thunder Bay.\r\n\r\nSuch was the fate of the man who was the first to cross from Lake\r\nOntario to the Susquehanna and pass from the villages of the Iroquois\r\nthrough neutral country to the shores of Lake Huron. Certainly he was\r\nthe first European to discover the picturesque beauty of the great\r\nSusquehanna River.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 John Harris, Who Laid Out Harrisburg,\r\n                  Had Narrow Escape, October 25, 1755\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Harris, Sr., built his log house on the bank of the Susquehanna\r\nRiver where the City of Harrisburg now stands in the year of 1705. This\r\nbuilding was subsequently stockaded and became known as Fort Harris.\r\n\r\nHarris was especially an Indian trader, but engaged largely in\r\nagriculture. It is said of him that he was the first person to use a\r\nplow on the Susquehanna, and moreover, that “he was as honest a man as\r\never broke bread.”\r\n\r\nThe elder Harris was born in the County of Yorkshire, England, of Welsh\r\nparents, in the year 1673, and was brought up in the trade of his\r\nfather, that of a brewer. He was of middle age when he emigrated to\r\nAmerica and located in Philadelphia, where he became a contractor for\r\ncleaning and grading the streets of the city. He married Esther Say, an\r\nEnglish lady, who possessed a remarkable personality and was noted for\r\nher extraordinary energy and learning.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1705, John Harris was given a license to “seat himself on\r\nthe Susquehanna, and to erect such buildings as are necessary for his\r\ntrade, and to enclose and improve such quantities of land as he shall\r\nthink fit.”\r\n\r\nHe tarried at Conewago awhile, but soon learned of the beauty and\r\nsuperior advantages of Paxtang, and that the best fording-place on the\r\nSusquehanna was near there, so he removed and, immediately upon his\r\narrival, commenced the erection of a home and storehouse, which were\r\nsubsequently to figure so conspicuously in the pioneer history of the\r\nyoung Province.\r\n\r\nIn connection with his farming he established a ferry which became known\r\nthroughout the entire Eastern section of the United States.\r\n\r\nMiss Wharton, in her delightful story, “In Old Pennsylvania Towns,”\r\nrefers to the elder Harris as follows:\r\n\r\n“John Harris is said to have lived on fairly good terms with the\r\nsurrounding Indians, but one thrilling experience of his is among the\r\ncherished traditions of Harrisburg.\r\n\r\n“It seems that a band of roving Indians from the Carolinas halted at his\r\ntrading post to exchange their goods probably for rum, of which the\r\nsavages already had too much. They became riotous in their drunken\r\nrevelry and, demanding more rum, were refused by Mr. Harris, who began\r\nto fear harm from his visitors.\r\n\r\n“Not to be denied they again demanded ‘Lum’ and, seizing him, they took\r\nhim to a mulberry tree near by and bound him to it, intending to burn\r\nhim after they had helped themselves to his stores.\r\n\r\n“Before the savages were able to carry out their evil designs, some\r\nfriendly Indians arrived on the scene, having been warned of the danger\r\nof his master by Hercules, a faithful colored servant of Mr. Harris. It\r\nis said that these friendly Indians had come to the rescue of Mr. Harris\r\nin consequence of some act of kindness which they had received from him.\r\n\r\n“The grave of Mr. Harris may be seen in the river bank opposite the\r\nCameron house and is now inclosed by a railing. He is buried under the\r\nmulberry tree to which he had once been bound, and at his feet rest the\r\nremains of the faithful Hercules, who had saved his master’s life.\r\n\r\n“There are men living in Harrisburg who remember the stump of the\r\nhistoric mulberry tree which residents of Harrisburg preserved for years\r\nby applying cement and plaster and later a shoot from the original tree\r\nflourished and bore fruit to which children strolling along the river\r\nbank would stop and help themselves.”\r\n\r\nHe died in 1748, and was succeeded by his son, who was born in the\r\noriginal Harris home, or Fort Harris, in 1727.\r\n\r\nHe was the first white child born in Pennsylvania west of the Conewago\r\nhills. He was carried to Philadelphia by his mother for the purpose of\r\nbeing baptized, and according to the parish register of Christ Church,\r\nin Philadelphia, this event was duly solemnized September 22, 1728, his\r\nage at that time being eleven months.\r\n\r\nWhen only a young man, John Harris, Jr., was occasionally employed by\r\nthe Province of Pennsylvania to transact important business with the\r\nIndians at critical periods.\r\n\r\nHis house was frequently visited by the aborigines, and several very\r\nimportant conferences were held there between the several tribes of\r\nIndians on the Susquehanna, Ohio, etc., and the Provincial Government of\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\nUnder the will of his father he became possessed of 700 acres of land,\r\non a part of which he later laid out the city of Harrisburg.\r\n\r\nJohn Harris, Jr., was an energetic and an extensive farmer and an Indian\r\ntrader, who enjoyed the confidence of the Indians to an unusual degree.\r\nHis ferry became the most prominent place along the frontier.\r\n\r\nPrior to 1754, he had been sent on an Indian mission to Ohio, and at the\r\nsame time to notice the practical route from his ferry to Logstown. He\r\nperformed his errand satisfactorily.\r\n\r\nHaving accepted an Indian agency he was faithful to his charge, both to\r\nthe Indians and the Provincial Government. The latter was kept\r\nconstantly advised of happenings among the frontier settlements, for at\r\nthis time many of the Ohio Indians had already taken up the hatchet\r\nagainst the English.\r\n\r\nHe frequently visited the Indians at Shamokin (now Sunbury), and when\r\nthe French and Indians had committed atrocious murders upon the frontier\r\ninhabitants he, aided by others, rushed to their rescue and often buried\r\nthe bodies of the slain.\r\n\r\nThese missions were frequently carried out under great hardship and\r\ndanger. The most serious experience in the life of John Harris occurred\r\nOctober 25, 1755, when the party he was leading from Shamokin was\r\nattacked near Mahanoy Creek by Indians lying in ambush and four of his\r\nparty were killed and four drowned. The person riding on the same horse\r\nwith Harris was shot and killed, and a moment later the horse was killed\r\nand Harris compelled to flee for safety by swimming the river.\r\n\r\nJohn Harris was a sincere patriot. When the independence of the colonies\r\nwas being agitated he thought it premature, fearing that the colonies\r\nwere unequal to the task of combating with Great Britain, but when\r\nindependence was declared, he advanced £3000 to carry on the contest.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of keen foresight. He understood the natural advantages of\r\nHarris’ Ferry, and twenty years before he laid out the town, he observed\r\nthat it would be a place of business and the seat of the government of\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\nWhen he laid out Harrisburg in 1785, he conveyed, with other property,\r\nfour acres on Capitol Hill, east of the present State buildings, for\r\npublic use.\r\n\r\nAfter a life of usefulness, he closed his eventful career, July 29,\r\n1791, and his remains rest in the old Paxton Presbyterian Church\r\ngraveyard alongside of the illustrious fellow-patriot, William Maclay,\r\nwhose daughter was his loving and devoted wife.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Fail to End Warfare Through Treaty at\r\n                        Albany, October 26, 1745\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the minority of Richard and Thomas Penn the Proprietary Land\r\nOffice had been closed from 1718 to 1732, and many immigrants seated\r\nthemselves without title on such vacant lands as suited their\r\nconvenience.\r\n\r\nThe number of such immigrants entitled them to great consideration.\r\nTheir rights accruing by priority of settlement were recognized by the\r\npublic and passed, together with their improvements, through many hands,\r\nin confidence that they would receive proprietary sanction.\r\n\r\nMuch agitation was produced when the Provincial proclamation required\r\nall who had not obtained and paid for warrants to pay to the Receiver\r\nGeneral, within four months, the sums due for their lands, under penalty\r\nof ejectment. As a consequence many and great difficulties arose. The\r\nAssembly sought to compromise the matter by postponement of payment of\r\nthe purchase money for several years.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain and Spain declared war October 23, 1739, and the old\r\ntroubles between the Governor and Assembly again appeared to disturb the\r\npeace of the Government. The Assembly refused to support England with\r\nmoney or troops and Governor Thomas was compelled to raise\r\nPennsylvania’s quota of 400 men by his own exertion. This he\r\naccomplished in three months, but many of his recruits were\r\nbond-servants willing to exchange their service and freedom dues for\r\nnominal liberty and soldier’s pay.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1744, hostilities were openly declared between Great Britain\r\nand France. The peaceful era in the Province was now at an end, and the\r\ndark cloud of the cruel savage warfare began to gather on the western\r\nfrontier.\r\n\r\nThe lands acquired by the infamous “Indian Walk,” and those of the\r\nShawnee, which were purchased without their consent, were now to be paid\r\nfor by the blood of the settlers.\r\n\r\nThe Delaware Indians refused to leave the forks of the Delaware, even\r\nthough the “walk” had determined these lands belonged to the\r\nProprietary. The Six Nations were called upon to order off the Delaware,\r\nwhich they did in an overbearing manner. The Delaware retired to Wyoming\r\nValley and the forks of the Susquehanna, at Shamokin, with this\r\nadditional wrong done them rankling in their breasts.\r\n\r\nFranklin published his “Plain Truth” in an endeavor to conciliate the\r\nAssembly and the Governor and awaken them both to the importance of\r\nmilitary preparations. Franklin was appointed a Colonel, but declined.\r\nHe preferred to wield the pen, with which he could be of far greater\r\ninfluence to the province. James Logan justified defensive war and\r\nassisted with his means.\r\n\r\nDefenses were erected below the City of Philadelphia from funds raised\r\nfor the purpose by means of a public lottery, in which many Quakers\r\nsowed a seed, trusting it would bring forth an hundredfold.\r\n\r\nThese military preparations were necessary for two purposes: to\r\nintimidate a foreign enemy and to curb the hostile disposition of the\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nThe alienation of the Indians was greatly to be dreaded, and Governor\r\nThomas called Conrad Weiser, the provincial interpreter, to the service\r\nand dispatched him on a mission to Shikellamy the great vicegerent at\r\nShamokin (now Sunbury), to renew the assurances of friendship and to\r\npropose his mediation between the Indians and the Government of\r\nVirginia, occasioned by an unpleasant encounter between some Onondaga\r\nand Oneida with the English while on an expedition against the\r\nTallapoosa, resident of that colony.\r\n\r\nWeiser was happily successful and a treaty was held the ensuing summer.\r\nThe Indians refrained from hostility in the meantime.\r\n\r\nThe treaty was convened at Lancaster, June 22, 1744, and ended July 4\r\nfollowing. It was attended by Governor Thomas in person, and by\r\ncommissioners of Maryland and Virginia.\r\n\r\nAll matters of dispute were satisfactorily settled, and the Iroquois\r\nengaged to prevent the French and their Indian allies from marching\r\nthrough their country to attack the English settlements.\r\n\r\nThis conference did not, however, remove causes for future disquiet,\r\noccasioned by the encroachments of the settlers and the unfair conduct\r\nof the Indian traders.\r\n\r\nThe Shawnee, on the Ohio, allied to the French interest, now assumed a\r\nhostile attitude. A great convention was held at Albany, October 26,\r\n1745, to which commissioners from New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut\r\nand Pennsylvania were sent.\r\n\r\nThe Six Nations were urged to take up the hatchet against the French and\r\nbecome parties in the war, but the Indians showed no disposition to\r\nenter the contest, and the result of the conference was far from being\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1746, Governor Thomas was directed by the Crown to raise forces\r\nfor a conquest of Canada. After much delay, the Assembly voted £5000,\r\nand Governor Thomas raised four companies of over one hundred men each,\r\ncommanded by Captain William Trent, John Shannon, Samuel Perry and John\r\nDeimer, who marched at once to Albany.\r\n\r\nThe attempt on Canada was postponed, but the troops were retained nearly\r\neighteen months along the Hudson to intimidate the Indians.\r\n\r\nJohn Penn died, and at a meeting of the Assembly held May 5, 1747,\r\nGovernor Thomas communicated the news of his death, and at the same\r\ntime, on account of his own ill-health, he resigned his office.\r\n\r\nOn the departure of Governor Thomas, the executive administration\r\ndevolved upon the Council, of which Anthony Palmer was president, until\r\nthe arrival of James Hamilton, son of Andrew Hamilton, former Speaker of\r\nthe Assembly, as Lieutenant Governor, November 23, 1749.\r\n\r\nThe crops were abundant in 1751 and 1752, but these years of plenty were\r\nfollowed by a season of want, covering the years 1753–1755, and on the\r\nheels of it came Indian hostilities.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the white population toward the west irritated the\r\nIndians. Especially was this true of the Scotch-Irish, who seated\r\nthemselves on the west of the Susquehanna, on the Juniata, and in the\r\nGreat and Little Coves formed by the Kittatinny and the Tuscarora hills,\r\nand at the Big and Little Connolloways.\r\n\r\nThe French applied themselves to seduce the Indians from their\r\nallegiance to the English. The Shawnee had already joined them, the\r\nDelaware awaited an opportunity to avenge their wrongs, and of the Six\r\nNations, the Onondaga, Cayuga and Seneca were wavering.\r\n\r\nTo keep the Indians in favor of the Province required much cunning\r\ndiplomacy and expensive presents. A chain of forts and the maintenance\r\nof a military force, drew heavily on the Provincial purse, and it is but\r\nlittle wonder that the Assembly and the Proprietaries early divided on\r\nquestions involving taxes and expenditures. The French and Indian War\r\nsoon broke in all its fierceness.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                William Wilson Sent on Important Mission\r\n                to Ohio Indians After Fort Pitt Treaty,\r\n                            October 27, 1775\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in the Revolution the Continental Congress opened negotiations for\r\npeace with the Indians. The frontier was divided into three Indian\r\ndepartments, of which the middle department included the tribes west of\r\nPennsylvania and Virginia.\r\n\r\nCongress named a committee, consisting of Benjamin Franklin and James\r\nWilson, of Pennsylvania, and Patrick Henry, of Virginia, to hold a\r\ntreaty with the Indians at Fort Pitt.\r\n\r\nThis treaty was assembled October 27, 1775, with the Seneca, Delaware,\r\nShawnee and Wyandot tribes, represented by their leading chiefs.\r\nGuyasuta, the principal Seneca, also represented the Iroquois, and he\r\npresumed to speak also for the Western tribes, which so aroused the ire\r\nof White Eyes, the Delaware orator, that his tribe declared their\r\nabsolute independence.\r\n\r\nThe council was neither harmonious nor entirely successful, and the\r\nEnglish soon bribed the Indians to take up the hatchet against the\r\nColonists. This they were easily able to accomplish, as they made\r\ntempting offers and made a greater display of military prowess.\r\n\r\nDuring the treaty at Fort Pitt the commission selected John Gibson as\r\nIndian agent for the Ohio tribes, but he was soon succeeded by Richard\r\nButler.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1776 Congress assumed direct control of the Indian agencies and\r\nplaced George Morgan in charge of the most important post at Fort Pitt.\r\n\r\nMorgan was a man of education, high family connections and considerable\r\nwealth. His home was in Princeton, N. J., but he owned a mercantile\r\nestablishment in Philadelphia, and as agent of his own trading house he\r\nhad traveled extensively in the Indian country, from the Allegheny to\r\nIllinois.\r\n\r\nHe arrived at Pittsburgh May 1, 1776, and immediately opened\r\nnegotiations for a better treaty with the Indians. He sent agents with\r\npacific messages among the tribes, employing in this service William\r\nWilson, Peter Long, Simon Girty and Joseph Nicholson.\r\n\r\nThe mission upon which he sent Wilson was the most important. He was an\r\nIndian trader and acquainted with the tribes between the Ohio River and\r\nDetroit. It was his duty to invite the Delaware, Shawnee and Wyandot\r\nchiefs to a council at Fort Pitt.\r\n\r\nEarly in June he departed, accompanied by Nicholson. They traveled on\r\nhorseback to the Delaware towns on the Muskingum River. There the chiefs\r\naccepted his invitation. He then journeyed to the seats of the Shawnee\r\non the Scioto, where he found many of the warriors to be in a very\r\ndoubtful humor.\r\n\r\nThe chief sachem, Hardman, and the brave war chief, Cornstalk, were\r\ninclined to peace, but advised that they had received an invitation to\r\ntake part in a great council with the British Governor at Detroit, and\r\nmust go there first.\r\n\r\nWhile Wilson was yet at the Shawnee towns, Morgan himself arrived there,\r\nand endeavored to arrange a definite date for the treaty.\r\n\r\nBefore Morgan departed for Fort Pitt, he handed to Wilson a large peace\r\nbelt of wampum and a written message to deliver to the Wyandot chief.\r\nWhen Wilson and Nicholson departed, they were accompanied by Cornstalk,\r\nbut they advanced only as far as Pluggystown, on the Upper Scioto. This\r\nplace was inhabited by renegade Indians.\r\n\r\nThe chief, Pluggy, was a Mohawk, and his followers, called Mingo, were\r\nhorse thieves and murderers. Pluggy’s warriors formed a plot to seize\r\nWilson and Nicholson and carry them to the British fort at Detroit,\r\nwhere a handsome reward would be theirs.\r\n\r\nThis plan was revealed to Cornstalk, who advised the white men to flee\r\nto the Delaware town of Coshocton. They were barely able to escape by\r\nnight and arriving at Coshocton, they placed themselves under the\r\nprotection of old King Newcomer.\r\n\r\nThat venerable sachem, believing it would not now be safe for Wilson to\r\nproceed to Sandusky, lest the Mingo should waylay the trail, sent\r\nKillbuck, a noted Delaware war captain, to bear the American message to\r\nthe Wyandot chiefs. Killbuck returned eleven days later with the message\r\nthe Wyandots wished to see Wilson in person as an evidence of his good\r\nintentions, but that they could not give a definite answer until they\r\nhad consulted their great council beyond the lake. The seat of the\r\nnation was in Canada, near Detroit.\r\n\r\nWilson determined to go to Sandusky, and the Delaware Council appointed\r\nWhite Eyes and two young warriors to accompany him. Nicholson had been\r\nsent back to Fort Pitt with a message to Morgan. Wilson was joined later\r\nby John Montour, a grandson of the famous Madam Montour, and he served\r\nWilson faithfully.\r\n\r\nBefore reaching Sandusky Wilson learned that the Wyandot chief had gone\r\nto the Detroit Council, and he therefore made up his mind to venture\r\ninto the immediate neighborhood of the British post, so that he might\r\ndeliver his message to the Wyandot chief.\r\n\r\nIt was the decision of a brave and bold man. He was received with\r\napparent friendliness by a majority of the chiefs and on September 2 he\r\naddressed them in council, presenting his peace belt and message from\r\nMorgan. He invited them to attend the council at Fort Pitt twenty-five\r\ndays from that time.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the Wyandot betrayed Wilson’s presence to the British\r\ncommander, Colonel Henry Hamilton. They returned the belt to Wilson and\r\nadvised him to explain his errand to the British official.\r\n\r\nWilson, White Eyes and John Montour were compelled to go with the\r\nWyandots to the great Council House in Detroit. Wilson frankly announced\r\nhis purpose to the Lieutenant Governor, again presented the peace belt\r\nand the written message to the Wyandot chief and handed the articles to\r\nColonel Hamilton.\r\n\r\nThe British commander addressed the Indians, saying those who bore this\r\nmessage were enemies to his King, and before he would take any of them\r\nby the hand he would suffer his right hand to be cut off.\r\n\r\nHamilton thereupon tore up the speech, cut the belt in pieces and\r\nscattered the fragments about the Council House. He then spoke to the\r\nWyandot Indians in French, which Wilson did not understand. Hamilton\r\nabused Montour for aiding the colonists and denounced White Eyes, whom\r\nhe ordered to leave Detroit in twenty-four hours if he valued his life.\r\n\r\nHamilton, notwithstanding his anger, respected Wilson’s character as an\r\nambassador and gave him safe conduct through the Indian country. The\r\ntrader returned to Fort Pitt much discouraged by the outlook and\r\nreported to Morgan that the Wyandot would go on the warpath. The Mingo\r\nwere already in the British service.\r\n\r\nIn spite of Hamilton’s opposition, Indians of four tribes attended the\r\ncouncil with the “rebels” at Fort Pitt, in the latter part of October.\r\nThe Delaware sent their ruling chiefs; the Wyandot sent Half King; the\r\nShawnee, the great Cornstalk, and the distant Ottawa sent one sachem.\r\nCostly presents were given them by the commissioners, and effusive peace\r\nspeeches were made by the savages, but only the Delaware were sincere.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               James Logan, Penn’s Secretary and Trusted\r\n                     Friend and Agent, Born October\r\n                                28, 1674\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lives of men like James Logan ennoble the pages of history and make\r\nits study an elevating pursuit and a reinforcement to the resources of\r\npublic morality. This man was worthy the compliment which the great\r\nvicegerent Shikellamy paid him, when he named his son in his honor; he\r\nwas worthy to have been the trusted friend of William Penn, and to have\r\nhad Benjamin Franklin for his printer.\r\n\r\nThe world has not produced many men, who, after forty years spent in the\r\nwhirl and muddy currents of active business and intense political\r\nstrife, can, with clean hands and unsullied reputation, calmly step\r\naside out of the turmoil and retire to the company of his books, to\r\nendow a library and make a translation of Cicero’s “De Senectute,”\r\nprinting it, as the writer himself pleasantly says, “in a large and fair\r\ncharacter so that old men may not be vexed by the defective eyesight in\r\nreading what was so appropriate to their years.”\r\n\r\nJames Logan was born in Lurgan, Ireland, October 28, 1674. His father,\r\nPatrick Logan, grandson of Sir Robert Logan of Restairig, Scotland,\r\nsprang from that stock of proud Scottish lairds, distinguished for long\r\npedigrees and barren acres, whose children have lent their genius to the\r\nservice of the world.\r\n\r\nJames Logan was a lad of precocious mind—at sixteen he knew Latin, Greek\r\nand Hebrew, and made rapid progress in mathematics. He afterwards\r\nmastered French, Italian and Spanish, and probably Dutch and German. He\r\nbecame familiar with several Indian dialects.\r\n\r\nHe went into trade as a linen-draper’s apprentice in Dublin, then in the\r\nBristol trade for himself.\r\n\r\nAt Bristol, in 1698, he met William Penn, and became his private\r\nsecretary and devoted follower ever after.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1699, he sailed with William Penn on his second visit to his\r\nprovince in America. In mid-ocean another ship came into sight, and as\r\nEngland and France were at war, all feared that the strange vessel might\r\nbe an enemy. The crew prepared for action. Penn and his friends, who did\r\nnot believe in warfare, went below. Only one of Penn’s party remained on\r\ndeck to help defend the ship, James Logan.\r\n\r\nSoon Logan went below to tell Penn that the strange vessel was English,\r\nwhen Penn reproved him for undertaking to engage in fighting, as he was\r\na Quaker. The young man replied with spirit: “Why did thee not order me\r\nto come down? Thee was willing enough that I should stay and help to\r\nfight, when thee thought there was danger!”\r\n\r\nPenn expected to stay in Pennsylvania the rest of his life, but on his\r\nvisit he was able to spend less than two years here. But during his\r\nstay, Logan had become not only a helper but also an intimate friend.\r\n\r\nPenn trusted his secretary to the utmost, and when he sailed away, left\r\nall his affairs in Pennsylvania under Logan’s direction. “I have left\r\nthee in an uncommon trust,” wrote Penn, “with a singular dependence on\r\nthy justice and care.”\r\n\r\nThere was no mistake in trusting James Logan. He kept Penn informed of\r\neverything, and scrupulously attended to all Penn’s business affairs.\r\n\r\nWilliam Penn never came back to see his province again. During the last\r\nsix years of his life his mind failed, so that his wife, Hannah, carried\r\non all business for him. Had it not been for James Logan, poverty would\r\noften have oppressed the great founder and his family.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment of Penn’s departure, in 1701, to Logan’s death, 1751, he\r\nwas always the power behind the proprietary throne, wielding what was\r\nsometimes almost absolute authority with singular propriety and\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nHe was secretary of the province, commissioner of property, and of\r\nIndian affairs, member and president of Council, acting Governor, and\r\nchief justice.\r\n\r\nAfter more than twenty-five years of residence in Philadelphia, Logan\r\ndecided to build a country home for himself. He erected a fine mansion,\r\nwhich he called Stenton, near the Old York Road. Here he lived for\r\nnearly a quarter century more.\r\n\r\nHis thigh was broken in a fall, and he was compelled to live retired,\r\nbut his love of books was so constant and sincere that the pursuit of\r\nliterature became his passion.\r\n\r\nBut even in seclusion he never neglected his public duties for his\r\nprivate tastes. Many important affairs of state were transacted at\r\nStenton, which was nearly always surrounded by deputations of Indians,\r\nwho camped about the house to seek advice and favors from their honored\r\nfriend “hid in the bushes.” As many as a hundred Iroquois once stayed at\r\nStenton for three days as Logan’s guests.\r\n\r\nThomas Godfrey’s improvements in the quadrant were made at Stenton under\r\nLogan’s eye, and Franklin and he worked together with a thorough\r\nappreciation of each other’s good qualities.\r\n\r\nThe British determined to burn Stenton, when they captured Philadelphia,\r\nbut the cleverness of an old Negro woman servant saved the historic\r\nmansion. Lord Howe afterwards made Stenton his headquarters.\r\n\r\nNow the famous house, quite two hundred years old, is owned by the\r\nPhiladelphia Society of Colonial Dames, and is kept in good condition\r\nand open for visitors. It stands near the station at Wayne Junction.\r\n\r\nLogan was an unsuccessful suitor for the hand of Ann, daughter of Edward\r\nShippen, who married Thomas Story. His wife was Sarah Read, daughter of\r\na wealthy merchant of Philadelphia, to whom he was wedded eight years\r\nafter his ill-success with Miss Shippen.\r\n\r\nHis children were not literary in their tastes and it was on this\r\naccount that he left his library to Philadelphia, endowing it for its\r\nperpetual maintenance, with the Springettsbury Manor property which he\r\nhad received from Penn’s estate.\r\n\r\nLogan was a fine type, dignified yet courteous, and his conversation was\r\nquiet and reserved.\r\n\r\nGordon says, “Never was power and trust more safely bestowed for the\r\ndonor. The secretary faithfully devoted his time and his thoughts to\r\npromote the interests of his master, and bore with firmness, if not with\r\ncheerfulness, the odium which his unlimited devotion drew upon himself.”\r\n\r\nHe died at Stenton, October 31, 1751.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Penn Lands at Upland and Changes Name to\r\n                       Chester, October 29, 1682\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter William Penn issued his frame of government for his new Province\r\nof Pennsylvania and had sent a description of his property throughout\r\nEngland, especially among the Friends, offering easy terms of sale,\r\nthere were many persons from London, Liverpool and Bristol who embarked\r\nin this enterprise and the association called “The Free Traders’ Society\r\nof Pennsylvania” purchased large tracts of land.\r\n\r\nPenn then obtained a deed for the three lower counties (now the State of\r\nDelaware), which was duly recorded in New York November 21, 1682.\r\n\r\nHaving completed all arrangements for his voyage to America, Penn wrote\r\nan affectionate letter to his wife and children and another “to all\r\nfaithful friends in England.” Accompanied by about 100 passengers,\r\nmostly Friends from Sussex, he embarked in August on the ship Welcome, a\r\nvessel of about 300 tons burden.\r\n\r\nAfter a voyage of two months they sighted the American coast about Egg\r\nHarbor, in New Jersey, on October 24, 1682, and reached New Castle,\r\nDel., on the 27th.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning Penn produced his deeds from the Duke of York\r\nand received possession by the solemn “delivery of turf, and twig, and\r\nwater, and soil of the River Delaware.”\r\n\r\nHis arrival off the coast and passage up the river was a continuous\r\ndemonstration of great joy by all classes—English, Dutch, Swedes, and\r\nespecially by his devoted followers.\r\n\r\nThe day following his landing Penn summoned the inhabitants to the\r\ncourt-house at New Castle, where, says Clarkson, “he made a speech to\r\nthe old magistrates, in which he explained to them the design of his\r\ncoming, the nature and end of government and of that more particularly\r\nwhich he came to establish.”\r\n\r\nAt this time he took formal possession of the country and renewed the\r\ncommissions of the magistrates.\r\n\r\nPenn then proceeded to Upland, where he arrived October 29, 1682. This\r\nwas a memorable event, says Clarkson, and to be distinguished by some\r\nmarked circumstances. Penn determined, therefore, to change the name of\r\nthe place, and turning toward his friend Pearson, one of his own\r\nsociety, who had accompanied him on the ship Welcome, he said:\r\n\r\n“Providence has brought us here safe. Thou hast been the companion of my\r\nperils. What wilt thou that I shall call this place?”\r\n\r\nPearson said, “Chester,” in remembrance of the place from which he came.\r\nWilliam Penn replied, that it should be called Chester, and that when he\r\ndivided the land into counties, one of them should be called by the same\r\nname.\r\n\r\nFrom Chester Penn proceeded, with some of his friends, in an open barge,\r\nin the earliest days of November, to a place about four miles above the\r\nmouth of the Schuylkill, called Coaquannock, “where there was a high\r\nbold shore, covered with lofty pines.”\r\n\r\nHere the infant city of Philadelphia had been established, and Penn’s\r\napproach was hailed with joy by the whole population.\r\n\r\nImmediately after his arrival in the “City of Brotherly Love,” Penn\r\ndispatched two persons to Lord Baltimore to ask of his health, offer\r\nkind neighborhood and agree upon a time of meeting. Penn then went to\r\nNew York to pay his respects to the Duke, returning to Philadelphia\r\nbefore the close of November.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that the “Great Treaty” took place at\r\nShackamaxon. Tradition has persisted that a great treaty took place here\r\nunder an elm tree, with William Penn, Deputy Governor Markham and\r\nothers, and the representatives of the several Indian tribes of that and\r\nother localities.\r\n\r\nEven if tradition errs in the details of this treaty, it is a fact that\r\nthe Indians themselves alluded to “the treaty of amity and peace held\r\nwith the great and good Onas” on all public occasions.\r\n\r\nOnas was the Indian name for the Governor of Pennsylvania, and it is\r\nsupposed that the “great and good Onas” referred particularly to William\r\nPenn himself.\r\n\r\nIt is also true that for a period of forty or fifty years the treaty\r\nPenn made with the Indians was not broken, and the land of Penn was\r\npreserved during all the time from the suffering of the scalping-knife,\r\nthe tomahawk or the torch.\r\n\r\nWilliam Penn convened a General Assembly at Chester, December 4, 1682,\r\nof which Nicholas More, president of the Society of Free Traders, was\r\nchosen speaker.\r\n\r\nDuring a session of four days this Assembly enacted three laws: (1) An\r\nact for the union of the Province and Territories; (2) An act of\r\nNaturalization; and (3) The great law, or code of laws, consisting of\r\nsixty-nine sections, and embracing most of the laws agreed upon in\r\nEngland and several others afterward suggested.\r\n\r\nPenn, by appointment, met Lord Baltimore at West River December 19,\r\nwhere he was received with great ceremony, but their interview led to no\r\nsolution of the vexatious question of boundary. The discussion lasted\r\ntwo days, but the weather became severely cold, precluding the\r\npossibility of taking observations or making the necessary surveys, so\r\nit was agreed to adjourn further consideration of the subject until\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nThe two Governors were taking measure of each other and gaining all\r\npossible knowledge of each other’s rights and claims preparatory to the\r\nstruggle for the possession of this disputed fortieth degree of\r\nlatitude, which case was destined to come before the home Government and\r\ngive Penn a great deal of trouble.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1683 Penn divided the province and territories each into three\r\ncounties—those of the former were called Bucks, Philadelphia and\r\nChester; those of the latter were New Castle, Kent and Sussex.\r\n\r\nSheriffs and other officers were appointed for the several counties,\r\nwrits for the election of members of Council and Assembly were issued\r\nconformable with the Constitution, and on January 10, 1683, Penn met the\r\nCouncil in Philadelphia and the Assembly two days later.\r\n\r\nThe Provincial Council was composed of eighteen members, three from each\r\ncounty, the Assembly fifty-four with nine from each county, making in\r\nall seventy-two. Thus was the Government of the province inaugurated,\r\nout of which has grown the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nPenn concluded two important treaties with the Indians during June and\r\nJuly, 1683. He also visited the interior of his province, going as far\r\nwest as the Susquehanna River.\r\n\r\nThe proprietary set sail for England June 12, 1684.\r\n\r\nPenn wrote a farewell letter to his province when on board the vessel,\r\nwhich was couched in the most endearing terms.\r\n\r\nAfter his departure the province and territories were divided into\r\ntwenty-two townships. There were then 7000 inhabitants, of whom 2500\r\nresided in Philadelphia, which already comprised 300 houses.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Frightened Settlers Build and Defend Fort\r\n                        Swatara October 30, 1755\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stockades and small forts built along the frontiers during the\r\nintense excitement which followed Braddock’s defeat in July, 1755, have\r\nalways been of great interest to local historians and the many citizens\r\nwho reside in the vicinity of these provincial defenses.\r\n\r\nOne such place, to which not a little interesting history is attached,\r\nwas built about twelve miles east of Manada Gap, near the passage\r\nthrough the Blue Mountains, by which the Swatara Creek wends its way to\r\nthe fertile acres below, and a few miles farther empties into the\r\nSusquehanna.\r\n\r\nIn the immediate vicinity of Swatara Gap was located Fort Swatara or\r\nSmith’s Fort, as it was sometimes called. An unfortunate fact was that\r\nthis fort was sometimes erroneously called Fort Henry or Busse’s Fort,\r\nand many incidents in and about this place are confused.\r\n\r\nAfter the disastrous beginning of the French and Indian War the Indians\r\nswept through the frontiers of Pennsylvania and committed terrible\r\nmassacres.\r\n\r\nThe news of the Penn’s Creek massacre soon reached the settlements on\r\nSwatara Creek and the farmers gathered together, October 30, armed with\r\nguns, swords, axes, pitchforks, whatever they happened to possess, until\r\nsome 200 rendezvoused at Benjamin Spickers, near Stoucksburg, about six\r\nmiles above Womelsdorf.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Mr. Kurtz[9] of the Lutheran faith, delivered an exhortation\r\nand offered prayer, after which Conrad Weiser divided the people into\r\ncompanies of thirty each.\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  Reverend John Nicholas Kurtz, first Lutheran Minister in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThey marched toward the Susquehanna, having first sent a company of\r\nfifty men “to Tolkeo in order to possess themselves of the Capes or\r\nNarrows of the Swahatawro, where we expected the enemy would come\r\nthrough,” wrote Colonel Conrad Weiser, to Governor Robert Hunter Morris.\r\n\r\nThe forces were augmented on the way, and by the time they arrived at\r\nSquire Adam Read’s plantation on Swatara Creek, they received the\r\nintelligence of the surprise and slaughter of members of Captain John\r\nHarris’ party at the mouth of the Mahanoy Creek.\r\n\r\nThis news dampened the ardor of the volunteers and they soon concluded\r\nthey could be of more effective service guarding their own firesides and\r\nthey hurried back. The news that 500 Indians had already made their way\r\nthrough Tolkeo Gap and had killed a number of people did not contribute\r\nto their joy on the long march home.\r\n\r\nColonel Weiser sensed the situation and fully understood he could not\r\ncount much upon this group, so he advised them to make a breastwork of\r\ntrees at Swatara Gap, promising to procure for them a quantity of bread\r\nand ammunition. They got as far as the top of the mountain; fired their\r\nguns to alarm the neighborhood, and then hurried back.\r\n\r\nSoon came the news of the murder of Henry Hartman, just over the\r\nmountain. When Mr. Parsons and a party went to bury the body, they\r\nlearned that two others had been recently killed and scalped, and some\r\nhad been captured. The roads were filled with persons fleeing from their\r\nhomes and confusion reigned.\r\n\r\nIt was clearly apparent that Swatara Gap must be occupied by troops and\r\nColonel Weiser ordered Captain Christian Busse with his company of fifty\r\nmen to “proceed to Tolihaio Gap, and there erect a stoccado fort of the\r\nform and dimensions given you, and to take posts there and range the\r\nwoods from the fort westward towards the Swatara and eastward towards a\r\nstoccado to be built by Cap. Morgan, about half way between the said\r\nfort and Fort Lebanon.”\r\n\r\nGovernor Morris writing to Governor Dinwiddie of Virginia, February 1,\r\n1756, advised him that he had arranged to build a chain of forts, about\r\nten or twelve miles apart, between the Delaware and Susquehanna. The\r\nbest is “built at an important Pass through ye Kittahteny Hills, on our\r\nNorthern Frontier and I have called it Fort Henry.” This is an error, as\r\nhe should have written Fort Swatara.\r\n\r\nThis might be proved by a letter Colonel Conrad Weiser wrote to Governor\r\nMorris, July 11, 1756, giving the assignment of his troops. He stated\r\nthat the men under Captain Smith are all placed in and about Swatara Gap\r\nand the Manada Fort; Captain Busse’s men were at Fort Henry and Captain\r\nMorgan’s at Fort Northkill and Fort Lebanon. This definitely proves that\r\nFort Swatara and Fort Henry were not one and the same place.\r\n\r\nThe first and most important of the commanders of Fort Swatara was\r\nCaptain Frederick Smith, whose company was recruited in Chester County.\r\nCaptain Smith was ordered, January 26, to proceed as soon as possible to\r\nSwatara and in some convenient place there to erect a fort.\r\n\r\nCaptain Adam Read and Captain Hendrick, who had been ranging the\r\nmountains, were ordered to dismiss their men and turn over their arms\r\nand supplies to Captain Smith, all of which was done.\r\n\r\nFurther mention of the actual building of Fort Swatara is missing, as is\r\nthe case of Manada Fort, but it is very probable that the stockade\r\nerected by the settlers was occupied by the provincial troops. This was\r\nnot a very formidable fortification, and was afterward referred to in a\r\nletter to Colonel Washington as “only a block house.” It may therefore\r\nbe presumed, at this late day, that it consisted of a single building,\r\nsurrounded by a stockade.\r\n\r\nThe many murders committed by the savages and their stealthy approach,\r\nmade it necessary to distribute the soldiers among the various\r\nfarmhouses, especially during the harvest season.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of these men was usually made under the direction of\r\nColonel Weiser, at consultations with the several commanders at Fort\r\nHenry.\r\n\r\nThis detail was not always satisfactory to the settlers, as may well be\r\nimagined. Each wanted troops to be on guard and there were never\r\nsufficient to supply the demand, but Captain Smith, at first negligent\r\nin this particular, was afterward complimented by both Colonel Weiser\r\nand Governor Morris for the faithful performance of his duty in the face\r\nof many hardships.\r\n\r\nAt the treaty held in Easton, in 1757, Conrad Weiser once more acted as\r\nagent for the Proprietaries, and interpreter. He arranged for a guard of\r\n110 men, who were to come from sundry forts, one of which was Fort\r\nSwatara.\r\n\r\nOn February 5, 1758, Adjutant Kern reported Lieutenant Allen and\r\nthirty-three men at Fort Swatara, and “its distance to Fort Hunter, on\r\nthe Susquehanna, as twenty-four miles.”\r\n\r\nThere are frequent references to be found in the Pennsylvania Archives\r\nof Paymaster Young’s visits to Fort Swatara.\r\n\r\nColonel James Burd’s tour of inspection in early spring of 1758 included\r\nFort Swatara, where he remained two days longer than desired on account\r\nof incessant rains. He reviewed the garrison Tuesday morning, February\r\n21. He did not seem very much pleased with conditions about the fort and\r\ngave orders intended to correct weaknesses. He ordered a cask of powder,\r\n100 pounds of lead and blankets for the garrison.\r\n\r\nAfter this tour of inspection there does not seem to be much more\r\nrecorded of the transaction of Fort Swatara.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Indian Ravages at McDowell’s Mill, Franklin\r\n                        County, October 31, 1755\r\n\r\n\r\nA place of much consequence in provincial Pennsylvania and frequently\r\nreferred to by public officers and agents was McDowell’s Mill. This was\r\nlocated midway between the Reverend John Steel’s Fort and Fort Loudoun,\r\neast of Kittatinny Mountains on the east bank of the Conococheague\r\nCreek, in the western part of the present Franklin County.\r\n\r\nThis defense was built in the year 1756 and was a log structure,\r\nrectangular in shape and provided with loop-holes. It stood until the\r\nyear 1840. There is at present a stone house erected on or near the site\r\nof this old fort.\r\n\r\nThis place was a private establishment, and the earliest public notice\r\nof it is in a letter written by Major General Edward Braddock to\r\nGovernor Morris, dated June 18, 1755, signifying his approbation of the\r\ndeposits being made at McDowell’s Mill instead of at Shippensburg.\r\n\r\nGovernor Morris wrote to General Braddock July 3, 1755, saying that he\r\nhad sent certain enumerated articles to Shippensburg, where “they will\r\nremain until I go up into the country, which will be on Tuesday next,\r\nand then I shall form the magazine at or near McDowell’s Mill and put\r\nsome stoccados around it to protect the magazine and the people that\r\nwill have the care of it; for without something of this kind, as we have\r\nno militia and the Assembly will maintain no men, four or five Indians\r\nmay destroy the magazine whenever they please, as the inhabitants of\r\nthat part of the Province are very much scattered.\r\n\r\n“I send you a plan of the fort or stoccado, which I shall make by\r\nsetting logs of about ten feet long in the ground, so as to inclose the\r\nstorehouses. I think to place two swivel guns in two of the opposite\r\nbastions, which will be sufficient to guard it against any attack of\r\nsmall arms.”\r\n\r\nOn October 31 began incursions which lasted for several days. Adam Hoops\r\nwrote to Governor Morris, dated Conococheague, November 3, 1755:\r\n\r\n“I am sorry I have to trouble you with this Melancholy and disagreeable\r\nnews, for on Saturday I recd. an Express from Peters Township that the\r\nInhabitants of the great Cove were all murdered or taken Captive and\r\ntheir houses and barns all in Flames. Some few fled, upon notice brought\r\nthem by a certain Patrick Burns, a Captive, that made his Escape that\r\nvery Morning before this sad tragedy was done.\r\n\r\n“Upon this information, John Potter, Esq., and Self, sent Expresses\r\nthrough our Neighborhood, which induced many of them to Meet with us at\r\nJohn McDowell’s Mill, where I with many others had the unhappy prospect\r\nto see the Smoke of two houses that was set on Fire by the Indians, viz,\r\nMatthew Patton’s and Mesheck James’s, where their cattle was shot down,\r\nthe horses standing bleeding with Indian Arrows in them, but the Indians\r\nfled.\r\n\r\n“The Rev. Mr. Steel, John Potter, Esq., and Several others with us, to\r\nthe Number of about an hundred, went in Quest of the Indians, with all\r\nthe Expedition Imaginable, but to no Success; these Indians have\r\nlikewise taken two Women Captives, belonging to said Township. I very\r\nmuch fear the Path Valley has undergone the same Fate.\r\n\r\n“We, to be sure, are in as bad Circumstances as ever any poor Christions\r\nwere in, For the Cries of the Widowers, Widows, fatherless and\r\nMotherless Children, with many others for their Relations, are enough to\r\nPierce the hardest of hearts; Likewise it’s a very sorrowful spectacle\r\nto see those that Escaped with their lives with not a Mouthful to Eat,\r\nor Bed to lie on, or Clothes to Cover their Nakedness, or keep them\r\nwarm, but all they had consumed into Ashes.\r\n\r\n“These deplorable Circumstances cries aloud for your Honours most Wise\r\nConsideration, that you would take Cognizance of and Grant what shall\r\nseem most meet, for it is really very Shocking, it must be, for the\r\nHusband to see the wife of his Bosom, her head cut off, and the\r\nChildren’s blood drank like Water by these Bloody and Cruel Savages as\r\nWe are informed has been the fate of many.”\r\n\r\nNovember 6, Hoops again wrote to Governor Morris, inclosing\r\nqualifications for two officers, and said:\r\n\r\n“Hans Hamilton is now at McDowell’s Mill with upwards of 200 men and\r\nabout 200 from this county, in all about 400 men.”\r\n\r\nSo it may be safely presumed as a fact that Governor Morris finally\r\ndetermined to establish his magazine at McDowell’s Mills and that these\r\nsoldiers stockaded the buildings according to the plans of Governor\r\nMorris.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, February 11, 1756, “two lads were taken or killed at the\r\nWidow Cox’s, just under Parnell’s Knob, and a lad who went from\r\nMcDowell’s Mills to see what fire it was never returned, the horse\r\ncoming back with reins over his neck; they burnt the House and shot down\r\nthe Cattle.”\r\n\r\nUnder date of March 25, 1756, Governor Morris sent the following to the\r\nReverend John Steele: “With these Instructions you will receive a\r\nCommission appointing you a Captain of a Company in the pay of the\r\nProvince, which is to be made up by Draughts of thirteen men out of Each\r\nof the Companys composed by James Burd, Hans Hamilton, James Patterson\r\nand Hugh Mercer, Esq., * * * also a Commission appointing James\r\nHollowday your Lieutenant * * * When you have formed your Company you\r\nare to take post at McDowell’s Mills, upon the road to Ohio, which you\r\nare to make your Head Quarters, and to detach patroling partys from time\r\nto time to scour the woods. * * * You are to apply to Mr. Adam Hoops,\r\nfor the Provincial allowance of Provisions for the men under your\r\nCommand.”\r\n\r\nGovernor Morris sent instructions to Elisha Salter, Commissary General\r\nof Musters, to proceed to McDowell’s Mill and muster the company under\r\nCaptain John Steel, and direct him to take post at McDowell’s Mill.\r\n\r\nRobert Callender wrote to Governor Denny from Carlisle, dated November\r\n4, 1756: “This day I received advice from Fort McDowell that on Monday\r\nor Tuesday last, one Samuel Perry and his two sons went from the Fort to\r\ntheir plantation, and not returning at the time they proposed, the\r\ncommanding Officer sent there a corporal and fourteen men to know the\r\ncause of their stay, who not finding them at the plantation, they\r\nmarched back toward the Fort, and on their return found the said Perry\r\nkilled and scalped and covered over with leaves; immediately after a\r\nparty of Indians, in number about thirty, appeared and attacked the\r\nsoldiers, who returned the fire, and fought for sometime until four of\r\nour people fell, the rest of them made off—six of them got into the\r\nFort, but what became of the rest is not yet known; there are two\r\nfamilies cut off, but cannot tell the number of people. It is likewise\r\nreported that the enemy in their retreat burnt a quantity of grain and\r\nsundry horses in the Cove.”\r\n\r\nThe activities of Fort McDowell ceased during December, 1756, when\r\nColonel John Armstrong removed the stores to Fort Loudoun, and increased\r\nthe capacity and strength of that place. Further references to\r\nMcDowell’s Mill are of no consequence, it being afterwards used by\r\nrangers who were scouting along that frontier.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Turmoil in Lower Counties; Penn Sails for\r\n                       England, November 1, 1701\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Constitution, which had been under consideration for eighteen\r\nmonths, was finally adopted October 28, 1701, and William Penn, pressed\r\nby many claims for his presence in England, set sail November 1 and\r\narrived there about the middle of January.\r\n\r\nHe had hardly landed before King William died, January 18, and Princess\r\nAnne of Denmark succeeded him. Penn was in great favor with her.\r\n\r\nThe new Constitution which Penn personally assisted in giving his\r\nProvince was as comprehensive on the subject of civil and religious\r\nliberty as the former ones.\r\n\r\nThere was established a Council of State, composed of ten members,\r\nchiefly Quakers and his intimate friends, of whom four made a quorum who\r\nwere empowered “to consult and assist with the best of their advice the\r\nProprietary himself or his deputies in all public affairs and matters\r\nrelating to the government.”\r\n\r\nAndrew Hamilton, a native of Scotland, one of the Proprietaries of New\r\nJersey, and formerly Governor of East and West Jersey, was appointed\r\nDeputy Governor, and James Logan Provincial Secretary and Clerk of the\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\nGovernor Hamilton’s administration was very brief, for he died while on\r\na visit to Amboy, April 20, 1703. The government then devolved upon the\r\nCouncil, of which Edward Shippen was president.\r\n\r\nAlmost the entire attention of the Government was directed to the\r\nconsummation of a union between the Province and Territories.\r\n\r\nThe Territories, or Lower Counties, persisted in the absolute refusal to\r\njoin with the Province in legislation until 1703, when it was finally\r\ndetermined and settled between them that they should compose different\r\nand distinct assemblies, entirely independent of each other, pursuant to\r\nthe liberty allowed by the clause in the charter for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe proprietary selected Mr. John Evans as the successor to Governor\r\nHamilton. He arrived in the province in February, 1704, and soon\r\nincreased the number of the council and called to that board, with\r\nothers, William Penn the younger, who had accompanied him to the\r\nprovince. Pursuant to the instruction of the proprietary, he earnestly\r\napplied himself to re-unite the province and Territories; and his lack\r\nof success in this measure produced an unfavorable disposition toward\r\nthe province, which embittered his whole Administration.\r\n\r\nGovernor Evans was but twenty-six years old when appointed, and he was\r\nzealous and active in the proprietary’s interest; he was deficient in\r\nneither wit nor talents, but lacked experience, prudence and tact, and\r\nwas offensive to the Quakers. He showed a partiality toward the lower\r\ncounties, which produced unpleasant effects in the province.\r\n\r\nEngland was at war with France and Spain, and Evans was ordered by the\r\nQueen to raise an armed force in Pennsylvania, but his efforts proved\r\nunsuccessful. He incurred even greater unpopularity among the Quakers\r\nand became odious to the people of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nHe offended the merchants of Philadelphia, when he authorized the\r\nerection of a fort near New Castle, where it could be of little use to\r\nthe province, and inward bound ships, not owned by residents, were\r\nobliged to deliver their half-pound of powder for each ton measurement.\r\nThe provincialists remonstrated against this abuse in vain.\r\n\r\nAt length Richard Hill, William Fishbourne and Samuel Preston, three\r\nspirited Quakers, resolved to remove the nuisance by a method different\r\nfrom any that had yet been attempted.\r\n\r\nHill and his companions, on board the Philadelphia, a vessel belonging\r\nto the former, dropped down the river and anchored above the fort. Two\r\nof them went ashore and informed French, the commander, that their\r\nvessel was regularly cleared, demanding to pass without interruption.\r\nThis demand was refused, when Hill, who had been bred at sea, stood at\r\nthe helm and passed the fort with no other injury than a shot through\r\nthe mainsail. French pursued in an armed boat and was taken aboard,\r\nwhile his boat, cut from the vessel, fell astern, and he was led a\r\nprisoner to the cabin.\r\n\r\nGovernor Evans was apprized of the matter and followed the Philadelphia\r\nby land to New Castle and, after she had passed the fort, pursued her in\r\na smaller but faster boat to Salem, where he boarded her in great anger,\r\nand behaved with considerable intemperance.\r\n\r\nLord Cornbury, Governor of New Jersey, who was also Vice Admiral of the\r\nDelaware, happened to be at Salem, and the prisoners were taken before\r\nhim. He gave them and Governor Evans, as well, a severe reprimand, and\r\nwhen all promised to behave in the future they were dismissed and\r\nGovernor Evans was jeered.\r\n\r\nFollowing this spirited action, the fort no longer impeded the\r\nnavigation of the Delaware.\r\n\r\nGovernor Evans made an extended trip among the Indians, which began June\r\n27, 1707. He was accompanied by several friends and servants. The\r\nConestoga and other Indians had advised him that the Nanticoke of\r\nMaryland designed war against the Five Nations. Governor Evans visited\r\nin turn: Pequehan, on the Pequea; Dekonoagah, on the Susquehanna, about\r\nnine miles distant from Pequehan; Conestogoe and Peixtang.\r\n\r\nAt the latter place he seized one Nicole, a French Indian trader,\r\nagainst whom heavy complaints had been made. His capture was attended\r\nwith difficulties, but he was finally secured and mounted upon a horse\r\nwith his legs tied together, beneath the horse’s belly.\r\n\r\nThe articles of remonstrance, subsequently addressed to the Proprietary\r\nby the Assembly, make it appear that the Governor’s conduct on this\r\noccasion and among the Indians was not free from censure, it being\r\ndescribed as “abominable, and unwarrantable.”\r\n\r\nTo add to Governor Evans’ other troubles he had a very unhappy\r\nmisunderstanding with his secretary, James Logan, which, with the\r\nantagonism of the Assembly, almost paralyzed legislative action, and led\r\nto a most lamentable exhibition of ill-temper on the part of the\r\nGovernor.\r\n\r\nRemonstrances were sent to William Penn, which tended to produce the\r\nvery steps which the Assembly desired to guard against, of provoking the\r\nGovernor to relinquish a troublesome and ungrateful Province to the\r\nCrown of England, which had long wished to possess it.\r\n\r\nGovernor Evans was removed early in the year 1709 and Captain Charles\r\nGookin appointed as his successor. Gookin was an officer in Earle’s\r\nRoyal Regiment, quite advanced in years, and in the language of Penn “a\r\nman of pure morals, mild temper and moderate disposition.”\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Indians Captured Frances Slocum, the “Lost\r\n                  Sister of Wyoming,” November 2, 1778\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the many dramatic incidents in the history of the Wyoming Valley\r\nfew, if any, are more thrilling or unusual than the carrying away into\r\ncaptivity of little Frances Slocum.\r\n\r\nJonathan Slocum, a Quaker, settled at Wyoming in 1762 and, with others\r\nwho survived the awful Indian massacre of October 15, 1763, left the\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1777 he brought his wife, six sons and three daughters\r\nfrom Rhode Island and again made his home at Wyoming.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, November 2, 1778, Jonathan Slocum and his sons, William and\r\nBenjamin, were at work completing their corn harvest. At the Slocum home\r\nwere the other members of the family, together with Mrs. Nathan Kingsley\r\nand her two sons. About noonday the Kingsley lads were sharpening a\r\nknife on a grindstone in the front yard. Suddenly the crack of a rifle\r\nwas heard, and Mrs. Slocum hastened to the front door, when she was\r\nhorrified to see the lifeless body of the elder Kingsley boy lying on\r\nthe ground. The Indian who killed him was preparing to scalp his victim\r\nwith the very knife the boys were sharpening.\r\n\r\nThe terrified mother snatched her infant from the cradle, called to the\r\nothers to run for their lives, and fled out of the rear door to a log\r\nfence beyond which lay a swamp, and there hid herself and her baby.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the younger Kingsley boy and Frances Slocum, then\r\nfive-and-a-half years old, hid themselves under a staircase; Judith\r\nSlocum, with her three-year-old brother Isaac, fled toward the swamp,\r\nwhile little Mary Slocum, less than ten years old, started on a run in\r\nthe direction of Fort Wyoming, carrying in her arms her baby brother,\r\naged one-and-a-half years. Ebenezer Slocum, then thirteen years old, was\r\na cripple and unable to get away with the others.\r\n\r\nWhile the Slocums were fleeing from their home the Indian in their\r\ndoor-yard was joined by two others, who made their way into the house\r\nand quickly ransacked it. Frances Slocum and young Kingsley were\r\ndiscovered in their hiding place, and dragged forth, while Ebenezer\r\nSlocum was seized in another part of the house.\r\n\r\nMrs. Slocum, leaving her baby behind, rushed into the presence of the\r\nIndians and implored the savages to release the children. She pointed to\r\nthe crippled feet of Ebenezer and exclaimed: “The child is lame; he can\r\ndo thee no good.”\r\n\r\nThe Indian who had him in his grasp released him to his mother. She\r\npleaded piteously for her daughter, but in vain.\r\n\r\nThe chief Indian of the three threw Frances athwart his shoulder, one of\r\nthe other Indians did likewise with young Kingsley, while the third one\r\nof the party shouldered the big bundle of plunder which had been taken\r\nfrom the house. They then dashed into the woods, and that was the last\r\nMrs. Slocum ever saw of her daughter, Frances.\r\n\r\nYears later it was learned from Frances Slocum herself that she and\r\nyoung Kingsley were carried to a cave where they stayed all night. Early\r\nthe following morning they set out and traveled for many days. When they\r\narrived at the village to which the Indians belonged, young Kingsley was\r\ntaken away and Frances never learned what became of him.\r\n\r\nThe chief took Frances to an aged couple of the Delaware nation, who\r\nadopted her. She was given the name of Weletawash, which was the name of\r\ntheir youngest child, whom they had lately buried.\r\n\r\nThey were living in Ontario when the Revolution ended. They then moved\r\nto Kekionga, the present site of the city of Fort Wayne, Ind.\r\n\r\nFrances states she was there long after she was full grown, and that she\r\ncould relate incidents of Harmar’s defeat, October, 1790. In 1790\r\nFrances married a Delaware brave named “Little Turtle.”\r\n\r\nDuring four years of war in what is Ohio and Indiana, Frances and her\r\nhusband and her foster-parents were almost constantly on the move. Her\r\nfoster-father could speak English and so could Frances, until he died,\r\nwhen she lost her mother-tongue. In 1794, “Little Turtle” left her and\r\nwent west.\r\n\r\nSometime in 1795 while on the move with her foster-parents, Frances\r\ndiscovered an Indian lying in the path suffering from wounds received in\r\nbattle with the whites. She dressed his wounds and nursed him back to\r\nhealth. He supplied them with game.\r\n\r\nWhen about to leave he was promised the adopted daughter in marriage and\r\nFrances became the wife of Shepoconah, a chief of the Miami tribe. Soon\r\nthereafter her foster-parents died and Frances and her husband removed\r\nto Fort Wayne.\r\n\r\nIn 1801 they, with their two sons and a daughter, removed to the Osage\r\nVillage, on the Mississineva River, about one mile from its confluence\r\nwith the Wabash. Here Shepoconah was made war chief, and Frances was\r\nadmitted into the Miami tribe and given the name Maconaquah, signifying\r\n“A Young Bear.” Shepoconah died in 1832.\r\n\r\nAfter the capture of Frances her father was killed, but many efforts\r\nwere made to obtain clues as to the whereabouts of Frances. After peace\r\nwas declared her brothers made a journey to Fort Niagara, where they\r\noffered a reward of 100 guineas for the recovery of their sister. These\r\nbrothers never gave up the search. They visited many Indian villages and\r\ntraveled thousands of miles, even enlisting the Government and large\r\nparties of Indians in their search. They attended every gathering of\r\nIndians where white children captives were to be given up. They believed\r\nshe still lived, and until 1797 every possible search was made, but the\r\nSlocums could get no trace of their captive sister during the life of\r\ntheir mother.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1835, Colonel George W. Ewing, an Indian trader, was\r\nquartered in the home of Maconaquah and she related the story of her\r\nlife to him. The next day he marveled at its mystery and wrote a\r\nnarrative of this woman, and addressed it to the postmaster at\r\nLancaster, Pa. No one was interested. Two years later John W. Forney\r\nbecame the publisher of the Intelligencer and ran across this letter and\r\npublished it, July, 1837.\r\n\r\nImmediately it was read by those who knew the story of the “Lost Sister\r\nof Wyoming.” Correspondence was started, and Joseph Slocum and two\r\nnephews traveled to the home of Maconaquah, where she was positively\r\nidentified and acknowledged him as her brother, but expressed no\r\ninclination to leave her wigwam to partake of the comforts of his\r\ncomfortable mansion in Wilkes-Barre.\r\n\r\nShe said in reply to their pleadings: “No, I cannot. I have always lived\r\nwith the Indians: they have always used me very kindly; I am used to\r\nthem. The Great Spirit has always allowed me to live with them, and I\r\nwish to live and die with them.”\r\n\r\nShe had indeed become an Indian even in looks. She thought, felt and\r\nreasoned like an Indian.\r\n\r\nThe Slocums had this comfort, their “Lost Sister of Wyoming” was not\r\ndegraded in her habits or character; her Anglo-Saxon blood had not been\r\ntainted by savage touch, but bore itself gloriously amid long series of\r\ntrials through which it had passed.\r\n\r\nCorrespondence was kept up between the relatives until the death of\r\nFrances, which occurred March 9, 1847.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 George Major, Chief Burgess of Mahanoy\r\n                   City, Murdered by Mollie Maguires,\r\n                            November 3, 1874\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Major, the popular chief burgess of Mahanoy City, died Tuesday,\r\nNovember 3, 1874, from the effects of pistol shot wounds received the\r\nSaturday previous, the assassins being members of the notorious Mollie\r\nMaguires.\r\n\r\nA great strike was in progress in the anthracite coal regions of\r\nPennsylvania, and during such periods of intense excitement the Mollies\r\nwere as active as a community of hornets whose nest some schoolboys had\r\ninvaded with paddles.\r\n\r\nGeorge Major had long since gained the enmity of this nefarious\r\norganization, and was a doomed man.\r\n\r\nJames McParlan, a young Irishman from Chicago, was the Pinkerton\r\ndetective who lived among the Mollies, became one of them, and who\r\nsuccessfully rid the State of the whole organization.\r\n\r\nOn the day of this murder James McKenna (as McParlan was known to the\r\nMollies), was in Shenandoah, but soon received intelligence of the\r\naffair. He was an officer of the Mollie organization and, in his\r\nofficial capacity, was detailed with Charles Hayes to go to the scene of\r\nthe shooting and gather such particulars as it was possible to obtain.\r\n\r\nThis information, of course, was for the use of the Mollies in event any\r\nof their members should be arrested for the crime, that an alibi could\r\nbe prepared for them.\r\n\r\nMcKenna and Hayes arrived on the scene early Monday morning, while the\r\nvictim was yet alive, but not expected to survive that day.\r\n\r\nMcKenna appeared particularly sad and dejected, declaring to his fellow\r\nMollies that his income from his (supposed) crooked peculations had run\r\nseveral months behind, so that he had no funds to expend in too many\r\ntreats. This was an excuse to provide him with a safe cover from which\r\nto carry on his observations, and he at once commenced hunting up the\r\nfacts connected with the shooting of Burgess Major.\r\n\r\nMajor had been shot through the left breast, two inches above the heart.\r\nThis fact was learned by McKenna as soon as he arrived at Clark’s house,\r\nthe rendezvous of the Mollies.\r\n\r\nThe proprietor, Clark, was not a member of the order, but his two sons\r\nwere Mollies. He was alone when McKenna arrived, and soon started to\r\ntalk about the shooting.\r\n\r\nAfter the usual greetings, McKenna asked Clark if he knew who fired the\r\nshot.\r\n\r\n“That I can’t, for the life of me, tell! There’s two stories about it.\r\nOne of them puts it on Dan Dougherty, but I believe him just as innocent\r\nas the babe unborn—and the other charges it on Major’s own brother,\r\nWilliam, hitting him be mischance, when firing after the Hibernian\r\ncompany’s boys—for ye must know that the whole trouble came about\r\nthrough a quarrel between the Hibernian an' the Citizen Fire Companies.\r\nOne is wholly made up of our countrymen, an' the other of\r\nModocs—English, German, Welsh an' what not! I suppose ye know that?\r\n\r\n“Yes! But who started the row?” queried McKenna.\r\n\r\nClark replied that he was sure it was not Dougherty. He told McKenna of\r\nthe fire which had called out the companies, and the fact that many\r\nfiremen were drunk. That on the way home some firemen got to fighting,\r\nwhen Chief Burgess George Major came out of his house, flourished his\r\nrevolver, and during the confusion shot a dog that was barking nearby.\r\nThis led to more shooting, when someone in the crowd took off the Chief\r\nBurgess, and his brother shot Dougherty in the neck.\r\n\r\nMcKenna then met Clark’s brother, who was a Mollie, and they went to\r\nDougherty’s home, and soon gained permission to see the wounded man.\r\n\r\nDougherty was almost delirious, and barely recognized his friends. He\r\nwas terribly wounded, the surgeons even thinking it unsafe to probe for\r\nthe bullet.\r\n\r\nMcKenna and Clark then went to McCann’s and soon gained the landlady’s\r\nconfidence and she invited them upstairs, where McCann was found in bed,\r\nalso wounded. He claimed Major had fired three shots at him.\r\n\r\nHere the scheme was hatched to swear out a warrant for the Chief Burgess\r\nbefore he should die, charging him with an assault with a deadly weapon.\r\nThat, they contended, would place McCann on the witness-stand and\r\nprevent him from being brought to the bar as a defendant. Others present\r\ndesired McCann to make his escape.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Burgess succumbed to his wounds Tuesday, November 3, and\r\nreceived burial, with suitable honors, the ensuing day.\r\n\r\nMcKenna returned to Shenandoah and reported to the Mollies the issue of\r\nhis trip. He had previously sent to Mr. Allan Pinkerton daily bulletins\r\nof his inquiries and their results.\r\n\r\nDougherty recovered, had his trial, early in May, and was acquitted.\r\n\r\nMcKenna was not ready to call his work at an end. Sufficient evidence\r\nhad not yet been obtained to bring the band of criminals to justice.\r\n\r\nBut it was only a few months later when the murderers of Alexander Rae,\r\nGomer James, William and Jesse Major, F. W. S. Langdon, Morgan Powell,\r\nThomas Sanger, William Uren, and others were brought to trial and such\r\nevidence obtained that the usual Mollie alibi was broken down and those\r\nguilty were made to suffer the penalty which they deserved.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Captain John Hambright Leads Expedition\r\n                    from Fort Augusta Against Great\r\n                        Island, November 4, 1756\r\n\r\n\r\nFort Augusta was built and garrisoned during the summer and fall of 1756\r\nunder the direction of Colonel William Clapham and 400 Provincial\r\nsoldiers recruited for that purpose. This formidable fortress was\r\nsituated at Shamokin, at the Forks of the Susquehanna, in what is now\r\nthe city of Sunbury.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers had barely landed at Shamokin until reports were brought\r\nthere that the French were coming in great force to besiege the fort.\r\n\r\nThe Indians, hostile to the English, committed such depredations that\r\nColonel Clapham sent out expeditions against the Indian towns on the\r\nJuniata, at Chincklamoose (now Clearfield); at Great Island (now Lock\r\nHaven), and up both branches of the Susquehanna River.\r\n\r\nDuring October, 1756, intelligence was received that Indian families,\r\nresident at the Great Island, were making many incursions against the\r\nsettlements. Several of them had visited Shamokin in August, when they\r\nkilled a bullock guard at the spring. And as they had formerly lived at\r\nShamokin, they were capable of very great mischief.\r\n\r\nColonel Clapham directed Captain John Hambright, of Lancaster, to lead a\r\ncompany of picked men and destroy the village.\r\n\r\nThe instructions for this perilous expedition are peculiar and of\r\nunusual interest to the present day residents along the West Branch of\r\nthe Susquehanna as far up as Lock Haven and, because they reveal the\r\ndangers such enterprises always encountered, they are given in full:\r\n\r\n“Sir:\r\n\r\n“You are to march with a Party of 2 Serjts., 2 Corporals and 38 Private\r\nmen, under your Command to attack, burn and destroy an Indian Town or\r\nTowns, with their Inhabitants, on the West Branch of the Susquehanna, to\r\nwhich Monsieur Montour will conduct you, whose advice you are directed\r\nto pursue in every Case.\r\n\r\n“You are to attack the Town agreeable to the Plan and Disposition\r\nherewith given you, observing to Intermix the men with Bayonets equally\r\namong the three Partys in the attack, and if any Indians are found there\r\nyou are to kill, Scalp, and captivate as many as you can, and if no\r\nIndians are there you are to endeavor to act in such manner, and with\r\nsuch Caution, as to prevent the Discovery of your having been there by\r\nany Party, which may arrive Shortly after you, for which Reason you are\r\nstrictly forbid to burn, take away, Destroy or Meddle with anything\r\nfound at such Places, and immediately dispatch Monsieur Montour, with\r\none or two more to me with Intelligence.\r\n\r\n“When ye come near the Place of action you are to detach Monsieur\r\nMontour, with as many men as he shall Judge necessary to reconnoiter the\r\nParts, and to wait in concealment in the mean Time with your whole Party\r\ntill his Return, then to form your measures accordingly.\r\n\r\nAfter having burnt and destroyed the Town, you are in your Retreat to\r\npost an officer and twelve men in Ambush, close to the Road side, at the\r\nmost convenient Place for such Purpose which may offer, at about Twelve\r\nmiles Distance from the Place of action, who are to surprise and cut off\r\nany Party who may attempt to pursue, or may happen to be engaged in\r\nHunting thereabouts, and at the same Time secure the Retreat of your\r\nmain Body.\r\n\r\n“'Tis very probable, that on these Moon Light Nights, you will find them\r\nengag’d in Dancing, in which case embrace that opportunity, by all\r\nmeans, of attacking them, which you are not to attempt at a greater\r\ndistance than 20 to 25 yards, and be particularly careful to prevent the\r\nEscape of the Women and Children, whose lives Humanity will direct you\r\nto preserve as much as possible.\r\n\r\n“If it does not happen that you find them Dancing, the attack is to be\r\nmade in the morning, just at a season when you have Light enough to\r\nExecute it, in which attempt your party are to march to the several\r\nhouses, and bursting open the Doors, to rush in at once. Let the Signal\r\nfor the general attack be the Discharge of one Firelock, in the Centre\r\nDivision.\r\n\r\n“If there are no Indians at the Several Towns, you are in such case to\r\nproceed with the utmost Caution and Vigilance to the Road which leads to\r\nFort Duquesne, there to lye in Ambush and to intercept any Party or\r\npartys of the Enemy on the march to or from the English Settlements, and\r\nthere to remain with the Design till the want of Provisions obliges you\r\nto return.\r\n\r\n“I wish you all imaginable Success, of which the Opinion I have of your\r\nself, the Officers and Party under your Command, leave me no Room to\r\ndoubt,\r\n\r\n                                  & am, Sir,\r\n                              “Your Humble Servant,\r\n                                                   “William Clapham.\r\n\r\n“P. S.—You will not omit to post the Sergeant with a party on the other\r\nside of the River during the attack, according to Direction, in order to\r\nprevent the Enemy from escaping that way and to reserve always one half\r\nof your Fire.\r\n\r\n“Given at Fort Augusta, Nov. 4th, 1756.”\r\n\r\nA close examination of the route of march reveals to those at all\r\nfamiliar with the topography of that part of the State that the\r\nexpedition crossed the river at Fort Augusta and marched through the\r\nravine to the lower side of Blue Hill, into what is now known as\r\nGranger’s Hollow, and continued up the country on the west side of the\r\nriver, passing through what is now Winfield, Lewisburg, West Milton, New\r\nColumbia and White Deer, where they evidently marched over the present\r\nLoganton road, following alongside White Deer Creek and then into the\r\nNippenose Valley; thence over the hills and down again into McElhattan\r\nGap, emerging at the river near Great Island.\r\n\r\nThis is the most direct route, and, as the Indians were good civil\r\nengineers and usually found the easy grades for their beaten trails,\r\nthere is little doubt but that Captain Hambright and his sturdy band of\r\nchosen men surely experienced a hard, rough march, even for that early\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nHe surely carried out his instructions, but what actually happened on\r\nthis march is unknown, as no records of his report are to be found among\r\nthe papers of that period. This is a matter of sincere regret, for the\r\nexpedition was one of great importance.\r\n\r\nIt is believed from notes made on a time-stained paper now in the State\r\nLibrary that the first village visited was situated a few miles above\r\nthe mouth of Pine Creek, opposite what is now the village of Pine,\r\nClinton County. The paper bears the following indorsement: “4th Nov.,\r\n1756. Route of Capt. Hambright’s Secret Expedition, Inclos’d in Col. W.\r\nClapham’s Ler of” (This sentence was unfinished).\r\n\r\nAntiquarians inform us that many years ago great quantities of Indian\r\nrelics were found at this site. It is only a short distance east of\r\nGreat Island, and nearly the exact distance from Fort Augusta, by\r\nfollowing the river, that is noted in Colonel Clapham’s letter.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Disputed Boundary Lines Settled at Fort\r\n                        Stanwix November 5, 1768\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the surrender to the Six Nations by the Proprietaries of\r\nPennsylvania, in September, 1758, of “all the territory lying to the\r\nnorthward and westward of the Allegheny Mountains,” the white settlers\r\ncontinued to encroach on the hunting grounds of the Indians.\r\n\r\nAt the great treaty held at Albany, the Proprietaries purchased and\r\nreceived a deed dated July 6, 1754, for the land of the Province above\r\nPenn’s Creek, in what is now Snyder County.\r\n\r\nThe Indians afterward asserted they were defrauded in this sale; that\r\nthe territory included lands they did not purpose selling and there was\r\nmuch dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\nTo settle their trouble a compromise was made at the Easton treaty,\r\nOctober, 1758, by the terms of which the Proprietaries authorized\r\nRichard Peters and Conrad Weiser to release and reconvey to the Six\r\nNations all the territory lying northward and westward of the Allegheny\r\nMountains which had been conveyed to the Proprietaries by the deed of\r\nJuly 6, 1754, “provided the Six Nations fully stipulate and settle the\r\nexact and certain bounds of the residue of the said lands included in\r\nthe before-mentioned purchase.”\r\n\r\nFollowing the successful termination of the Pontiac Conspiracy in 1764,\r\nthe whites were less fearful of the Indians and settled in the Indian\r\ncountry with much more confidence. The Indians were quick to grasp the\r\nsituation and made vigorous complaint to the Governor and all the other\r\nprovincial authorities.\r\n\r\nProclamations were issued against the settlers without effect, and\r\nfinally, February 3, 1768, the Pennsylvania Assembly passed an act on\r\nthe subject. It was enacted that if any persons, already settled or\r\nafterward moved on unpurchased lands, neglected or refused to remove\r\nfrom the same within thirty days after they were required to do so by\r\nthe Governor after notice prohibiting occupancy as aforesaid, being\r\nlegally convicted, were to be punished with death without the benefit of\r\nclergy.\r\n\r\nThree weeks after the enactment of the foregoing law Governor Penn\r\nissued a proclamation to every person to remove themselves and their\r\nfamilies off and from the said lands on or before the first day of May\r\nnext ensuing.\r\n\r\nBut proclamations, edicts and acts seemed to be of no avail, and the\r\ndisputes between the whites and Indians became most acute. At length, in\r\nthe summer of 1768, Sir William Johnson, the great English agent and\r\ntrue friend of the Six Nations Indians, determined to hold a great\r\ncouncil with the Indians “not only for the purpose of renewing the\r\nancient covenant chain between the English and the Indians, but to\r\nestablish a scientific frontier.”\r\n\r\nIn preparation for this great council twenty large bateaux, laden with\r\npresents best suited to propitiate the Indians, had been conveyed to\r\nFort Stanwix, now Rome, N. Y. Sir William Johnson ordered sixty barrels\r\nof rice and seventy barrels of provisions. When the council opened 3200\r\nIndians were present, “each of whom,” wrote Sir William, “consumes daily\r\nmore than two ordinary men amongst us, and would be extremely\r\ndissatisfied if stinted when convened for business.”\r\n\r\nThe Indians invited to the council began to assemble at Fort Stanwix\r\nearly in October, 1768, and by the middle of the month the various\r\nofficials expected to be present were on the ground. From Pennsylvania\r\ncame Governor John Penn, the Reverend Richard Peters, Benjamin Franklin\r\nand James Tilghman.\r\n\r\nGovernor Penn remained only for the preliminary negotiations, as\r\nimportant business of the Province compelled his early presence in\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\nMessrs Peters and Tilghman represented Pennsylvania as Commissioners.\r\nConnecticut, New Jersey, Virginia and New York were also represented by\r\nhigh officials.\r\n\r\nEight tribes of Indians, including the Delaware, the Shawnee and all the\r\ntribes of the Six Nations, were present in larger numbers, while many\r\nother tribes were represented by small delegations.\r\n\r\nThe Seneca went to this great conference armed as if going on the\r\nwarpath. There were also present a large number of private citizens\r\neither through curiosity or by reason of some personal interest in the\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\nThe records of this great council would indicate that Sir William\r\nJohnson and the Commissioners dined together. They formally drank\r\nvarious toasts, as was usual in those times. Frequently these toasts\r\nwere drunk to the King’s health, and on one or two occasions the\r\nlanguage used gave offense to certain of the King’s officers at the\r\ntable. Once a minister proposed a toast “not to the King of England, but\r\nto the King that hears our prayers.” The trouble with the mother country\r\nwas even then brewing.\r\n\r\nSir William opened the council by telling the Indians that “the King was\r\nresolved to terminate the grievances from which they suffered for want\r\nof a boundary, and that the King had ordered presents proportionate to\r\nthe nature and extent of the interests involved.” The Indians retired\r\nand for several days were in private council.\r\n\r\nThe new boundary had been practically agreed upon at a treaty held in\r\n1765, its course being diagonally through Pennsylvania from a point one\r\nmile above the mouth of John Penn’s Creek, Snyder County, to a point\r\nthen called Oswegy, now Oswego, N. Y. Beyond that point, the direction\r\nin which the line should be run seems to have occasioned the greatest\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nThe question was finally and satisfactorily settled, and a deed was made\r\nand signed November 5, 1768, by a representative from each tribe of the\r\nSix Nations, fixing and describing the boundary-line and granting the\r\nland east of it to the King of England. The actual sum paid for this\r\nvast territory was about $50,600.\r\n\r\nFrom a point on the Allegheny River several miles above Pittsburgh, this\r\nhistoric line of property ran in a northeasterly direction to the head\r\nof Towanda Creek, proceeding down the stream to the Susquehanna; thence\r\nit went northward along the river to Tioga Point, eastward to Owego, and\r\ncrossed the country to the Delaware, reaching it at a point a few miles\r\nbelow Hancock. From here it went up the Delaware to what is now Deposit,\r\nBroome County, N. Y. Thence the line went directly across the hills to\r\nthe Unadilla, and up that stream “to the west branch, to the head\r\nthereof.”\r\n\r\nThe “Fort Stanwix Treaty Lines” through Pennsylvania included all or\r\npart of the present counties of Pike, Wayne, Susquehanna, Lackawanna,\r\nLuzerne, Bradford, Sullivan, Wyoming, Montour, Northumberland, Lycoming,\r\nUnion, Clinton, Center, Clearfield, Cambria, Indiana, Armstrong,\r\nAllegheny, Westmoreland, Somerset, Fayette, Green, Washington and\r\nBeaver.\r\n\r\nIt was also at this treaty that the Proprietaries were actively\r\nconcerned in the purchase of the Wyoming lands then claimed by the State\r\nof Connecticut. In this object the Pennsylvanians were successful.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 First Siege of Yellow Fever Checked in\r\n                     Philadelphia November 6, 1793\r\n\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia was visited twice by the dreaded pestilence of yellow\r\nfever, first in the year 1793 and again in 1798. The general\r\nconsternation which incited many to flee from the destroyer “produced\r\nscenes of distress and misery,” wrote Matthew Carey, “of which parallels\r\nare rarely met with, and which nothing could palliate but the\r\nextraordinary public panic and the great law of self-preservation. Men\r\nof affluent fortunes, who gave daily employment and sustenance to\r\nhundreds, were abandoned to the care of a Negro after their wives,\r\nchildren, friends, clerks and servants had fled away and left them to\r\ntheir fate.\r\n\r\n“In some cases, at the commencement of the disorder, no money could\r\nprocure proper attendance. With the poor the case was, as might be\r\nexpected, infinitely worse than the rich, and many of these perished\r\nwithout a human being to hand them a drink of water, to administer\r\nmedicine or to perform any charitable office for them. Various instances\r\noccurred of dead bodies being found lying in the streets, of persons who\r\nhad no house or habitation and could procure no shelter.”\r\n\r\nThe cessation of business, in consequence of the plague, threw hundreds\r\nof poor people out of employment. Want and famine made their appearance.\r\nWhile the fatal atmosphere of contagion overspread the devoted city the\r\nmost frightful exaggerations of the real condition of things were spread\r\nthroughout the country, the consequence of which very soon became\r\nserious.\r\n\r\nIn nearly all the cities and towns, near and far, with a few humane\r\nexceptions, all intercourse with Philadelphia was prohibited. This added\r\nto the general distress.\r\n\r\nThe deadly disease swept away whole families. Eleven persons died in one\r\nhouse within a day.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia with 50,000 population in 1792 was then not only the\r\nlargest and busiest city of the Nation but its seat of government. The\r\nCongress moved from the city to Germantown; President George Washington\r\nand the members of his Cabinet and their families departed the city, and\r\nevery person who could afford it followed their example.\r\n\r\nOne out of every five who remained in Philadelphia died. Churches and\r\nschools, as well as the stores and mills closed their doors. Half the\r\nhouses stood empty. Those who ventured to walk abroad held over their\r\nnostrils handkerchiefs soaked in vinegar and avoided shaking hands with\r\nany one.\r\n\r\nGrass grew high in the main streets. Carts passed the main thoroughfares\r\nto carry the bodies of those who had perished. The drivers called out at\r\nintervals, “Bring out your dead!”\r\n\r\nThe disease itself was horrible and filthy. The sick were gathered into\r\nhospitals, but these, unlike the great hospitals of today, added to\r\ntheir misery. They were mere barns where patients lay crowded together,\r\nwithout proper care. Nurses could not be obtained even at high wages,\r\nfor to nurse the victims of yellow fever meant almost certain death.\r\n\r\nMayor Mathew Clarkson asked for volunteers to form a Committee of Safety\r\nwhich should do whatever seemed possible for the health of the city.\r\nOnly twelve men in that greatest of American cities answered the call,\r\nso serious was the situation.\r\n\r\nOne of these volunteers was none other than the greatest man of his day,\r\nCaptain Stephen Girard. Only two of these twelve volunteered to serve at\r\nthe hospital, and these heroes were Stephen Girard and Peter Helm. Both\r\npossessed great wealth and might have fled the city to live in safety\r\nand comfort far from the scene of this horrible pestilence, but they\r\nnobly chose to help their fellow men and risk their own lives.\r\n\r\nOf these two men Girard took the post of greatest danger, the interior\r\nof the hospital. There for two months he spent a large part of each day,\r\nnursing his patients. No money could pay for such services and Girard\r\nwould have accepted no return. Moreover, he went with his own carriage\r\nto the houses where the sick lay, entered them, and drove with them to\r\nthe hospital.\r\n\r\nAt last the benevolence of the inhabitants elsewhere came to their\r\nrelief, and contributions in money and provisions were poured out with a\r\nliberal hand, which relieved the physical distress. But it took the\r\nreturn of cold weather to check the fever and on November 6 the citizens\r\nwho had fled at the beginning of the plague began to return, and from\r\nthat day conditions rapidly improved.\r\n\r\nIn the plague of 1793 the mortality was 3293, as reported by the\r\n“Minutes of the Committee.”\r\n\r\nIn this scourge there were on Market Street and north thereof 1178\r\nhouses shut up and 1066 open, and 1152 deaths. Of the white inhabitants\r\n4627 fled, 7332 remained in the city, and of the colored inhabitants 64\r\nfled out of the city and 474 remained.\r\n\r\nSouth of Market Street 1009 houses were closed and 969 remained open and\r\noccupied, 1068 died, 4289 fled and 6133 remained, and 174 Negroes fled\r\nand 833 remained to face the plague.\r\n\r\nIn the Northern Liberties 302 houses were closed and 822 remained\r\noccupied; 546 died, 1751 fled and 4943 remained; 28 Negroes ran away and\r\n205 remained.\r\n\r\nIn the district of Southwark 239 houses were empty and 742 occupied; 527\r\ndied, 1239 whites fled and 4521 remained, and 24 Negroes fled and 234\r\nremained.\r\n\r\nThus in the city 2728 houses were closed on account of the occupants\r\nfleeing the city or dying and 3599 remained occupied. More than 12,000\r\ninhabitants fled the city, while 25,000 remained and came into close\r\ncontact with the fever victims.\r\n\r\nThe figures given here were taken during the month of November, when the\r\ncooler weather was beginning to check the ravages of the plague.\r\nAccording to the statisticians of that day, the average of those who\r\nfell victims to the fever amounted to more than six and one-third\r\npersons to the house.\r\n\r\nAmong those attacked were Governor Thomas Mifflin and Alexander\r\nHamilton, Secretary of the Treasury in President Washington’s Cabinet.\r\n\r\nBoth recovered and on November 14 the Governor issued a proclamation\r\nstating the pestilence had ceased and fixing a day of thanksgiving,\r\nfasting and prayer. The disease was considered to be conquered about\r\nNovember 6, and from that time confidence returned.\r\n\r\nWhen the city was again desolated by yellow fever in 1798 the deaths\r\nreached an enormous rate and much greater than in 1793.\r\n\r\nIn the month of August, 1798, the deaths in Philadelphia were 621 and in\r\nAugust, 1793, 264; in twelve days in September, 1798, 720 died, and\r\nduring the same days in 1793 there were 290 deaths reported. From August\r\n8 to October 3, 1798, there were 2778 deaths, and in this same period in\r\n1793 there were 1847 deaths, so it is safe to predict that about twice\r\nas many deaths occurred in the second plague as in the first.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Philadelphia Merchants Rebel Against\r\n                      Stamp Act in Great Meeting,\r\n                            November 7, 1765\r\n\r\n\r\nThe relations between the colonies and the mother country at end of the\r\nFrench and Indian War would doubtless have continued friendly had the\r\nlatter not seen fit to pursue a new policy toward the former with\r\nrespect to revenue and taxation. The colonies, until then, had been\r\npermitted to tax themselves.\r\n\r\nThe first act of the British Parliament aiming at the drawing of a\r\nrevenue from the colonies was passed September 29, 1764. This act\r\nimposed a duty on “clayed sugar, indigo, coffee, etc., being a produce\r\nof a colony not under the dominion of his Majesty.”\r\n\r\nIn the colonies it was contended that “taxation and representation were\r\ninseparable, and that they could not be safe if their property might be\r\ntaken from them without their consent.”\r\n\r\nThis claim of right of taxation on the one side and the denial of it on\r\nthe other was the very pivot on which the Revolution turned.\r\n\r\nEngland maintained her position in this matter, and in 1765 the famous\r\nStamp Act passed both Houses of Parliament. This ordained that\r\ninstruments of writing, such as deeds, bonds, notes, etc., among the\r\ncolonies should be null and void unless executed on stamped paper, for\r\nwhich duty should be paid to the Crown.\r\n\r\nThe efforts of the American colonists to stay the mad career of the\r\nEnglish Ministry proved unavailing. Dr. Benjamin Franklin, then in\r\nLondon as the agent of the Province of Pennsylvania, labored earnestly\r\nto avert a measure which his sagacity and extensive acquaintance with\r\nthe American people taught him was pregnant with danger to the British\r\nEmpire; but he did not entertain the thought that it would be forcibly\r\nresisted.\r\n\r\nThe opposition to the Stamp Act was so decided and universal that Lord\r\nGrenville, to conciliate the Americans, asked their agents to suggest\r\nthe person to have the sale of the stamps in their respective colonies.\r\nFranklin named his friend John Hughes, who in the Assembly had been\r\nvoting with the opponents of the Proprietaries.\r\n\r\nFranklin’s enemies tried to make much capital out of this participation\r\nin the introduction of the stamps, while Hughes and Galloway tried to\r\nlay the blame for the popular outburst upon the Proprietary Party in\r\nboth contrivance and connivance.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts Assembly suggested that the various Houses of\r\nRepresentatives or Burgesses in America send committees to a meeting in\r\nNew York City on the first Tuesday of October, 1765, to consider a\r\nunited representation to the King and Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly of Pennsylvania decided unanimously that it ought to\r\nremonstrate against the Stamp Act, and appointed as its committee\r\nSpeaker Fox and Messrs. John Dickinson, George Bryan and John Morton.\r\nNine resolutions on the subject of the “unconstitutional impositions”\r\nwere adopted unanimously.\r\n\r\nMr. Hughes feared being mobbed during the joy of celebration incident to\r\nthe change of ministry in England. He sat at his home, armed, watching\r\nfor an attack on his house, but at midnight those whom he feared\r\ndispersed, after burning a “stamp man” in effigy.\r\n\r\nHughes wrote to Governor John Penn and to Mr. Dickinson, the master of\r\nthe ship which brought the stamps, that he had received no commission to\r\ntake charge of them. The ship then lay at New Castle, afraid to proceed\r\nfarther, but on October 5 she sailed up the river to Philadelphia,\r\nescorted by a man-of-war.\r\n\r\nAll the vessels in the harbor put their flags at half-mast, the bells of\r\nthe State House and Christ Church were muffled and tolled until evening,\r\nand two Negroes with drums summoned the people to a meeting at the State\r\nHouse. This sent Robert Morris, Charles Thomson, and others to Hughes,\r\nwho was very ill at his home, asking him to resign, or at least to\r\npromise not to execute his office.\r\n\r\nThe crowd, Hughes said, was stirred up by the son of Franklin’s great\r\nenemy, Chief Justice Allen.\r\n\r\nOn the following Monday, Hughes gave assurance that neither he nor his\r\ndeputies would act until King George’s pleasure be known, or the law be\r\nput into execution in other colonies, or the Governor commanded him.\r\n\r\nHughes wrote to the Commissioners of the Stamp Office that he would\r\nperform his duties if his hands were sufficiently strengthened, but in\r\ndue time he resigned.\r\n\r\nOn November 7, 1765, the merchants of Philadelphia assembled at the\r\nCourt House, where they adopted nonimportation resolutions which were\r\nembodied in an agreement soon signed by almost everybody who could be\r\ndescribed as a merchant or trader, setting forth that the difficulties\r\nthey labored under were owing to the restrictions, prohibitions and\r\nill-advised resolutions in recent acts of Parliament.\r\n\r\nThese measures had limited the exportation of some of the produce,\r\nincreased the expense of many imported articles and cut off the means of\r\nsupplying themselves with sufficient specie even to pay the duties\r\nimposed.\r\n\r\nThe Province was heavily in debt to Great Britain for importations, and\r\nthe Stamp Act would tend to prevent remittances, and so it was hoped the\r\npeople of the Province would be frugal in the consumption of all\r\nmanufactures except those of America or of Ireland, coming directly\r\nthence, and that the merchants and manufacturers of Great Britain would\r\nfind it to their interest to befriend them.\r\n\r\nThe subscribers agreed and pledged their honor to direct all goods\r\nordered from Great Britain not to be shipped and to cancel all former\r\norders until the Stamp Act be repealed. The ships already cleared for\r\nGreat Britain owned by the merchants were allowed to bring back the\r\nusual bulky articles but no dry goods, except dye stuffs, and utensils\r\nnecessary for carrying on the manufactures, and to sell no articles sent\r\non commission after January 1, 1766.\r\n\r\nThe committee which circulated this agreement for signatures, and was\r\nappointed to see to its being carried out, was composed of Thomas\r\nWilling, Samuel Mifflin, Thomas Montgomery, Samuel Howell, Samuel\r\nWharton, John Rhea, William Fisher, Joshua Fisher, Peter Chevalier,\r\nBenjamin Fuller and Abel Jones.\r\n\r\nIn February Franklin was examined before the House of Commons, when he\r\ntold them there was not enough gold and silver in the colonies to pay\r\nthe stamp duty for one year. He gave it as his opinion that the people\r\nof America would never submit to paying the stamp duty unless compelled\r\nby force.\r\n\r\nParliament had only the alternative to compel submission or to repeal\r\nthe act. It was repealed March 18, 1766, but accompanying it was the one\r\nknown as the Declaratory Act, more hostile to the American rights than\r\nany of its predecessors. This act affirmed “that Parliament have, and of\r\nright ought to have power to bind the colonies in all cases whatsoever.”\r\n\r\nThe news of the repeal reached America in May and caused unbounded\r\ndemonstrations of joy. Though the Quakers generally would not have\r\nviolently resisted the execution of the law, they shared with others the\r\njoy produced by the tidings of the repeal.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Expeditions Against Indians—Franklin Sails\r\n                     for England, November 8, 1764\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon after John Penn assumed the office of Lieutenant Governor,\r\nNovember, 1763, he convened the Assembly and presented General Gage’s\r\nrequest for 1000 men, to be used in the proposed Indian campaign, which\r\nwas granted, together with a vote of credit for the additional force\r\nnecessary “to frustrate the further wicked designs of those lawless\r\nrioters.” This had reference to the “Paxtang Boys” and their bold attack\r\nupon the Conestoga Indians, December 14, 1763.\r\n\r\nSir William Johnson, of New York, who had charge of Indian affairs for\r\nthe Royal Government, having learned of both the above massacre and\r\nthose in the Nain and Wichetunk settlements, a short time previous, and\r\nbeing possessed of the actual facts, was particularly anxious to\r\nacquaint the Six Nations with the details, and thus remove any bad\r\nimpressions as to the faith of Pennsylvania in dealing with friendly\r\nIndians. It was most vital that there should be no alienation of the Six\r\nNations from the English interest.\r\n\r\nThe affair of the Paxtang Boys was happily settled without any unfair or\r\nunwise hardships and the attention of the authorities again turned to\r\nbigger problems and those more difficult of solution.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1764 extensive measures were resolved upon for the reduction of\r\nthe Indians. General Gage determined to attack them on two sides, and to\r\nforce them from the frontiers by carrying the war into the heart of\r\ntheir own country. One corps was sent under command of Colonel\r\nBradstreet to act against the Wyandot, Ottawa, Chippewa and other\r\nnations living upon or near the lakes. Another, under command of Colonel\r\nHenry Bouquet, was sent to attack the Delaware, Shawnee, Mingo, Mohican\r\nand other nations between the Ohio River and the lakes.\r\n\r\nThe two commands were to act in concert. Colonel Bradstreet was directed\r\nto proceed to Detroit, Michilimackinack and other places, and on his\r\nreturn to encamp and remain at Sandusky, and prevent the Western Indians\r\nfrom rendering aid to those on the Ohio, while Colonel Bouquet was to\r\nattack the latter in the midst of their settlements.\r\n\r\nPart of the Forty-second and Sixtieth Regiments were assigned to Colonel\r\nBouquet, to be joined with 200 friendly Indians, and provincial troops\r\nfrom Pennsylvania and Virginia. The Indians never came and Virginia\r\ncould not spare any men, but Pennsylvania furnished the one thousand\r\nmen, which was its quota. The Provincial Assembly also voted 50,000\r\npounds to maintain it.\r\n\r\nThis force was reduced by the desertion of 200 before leaving Carlisle,\r\nand of others at Fort Bedford. Those remaining, with a very few\r\nregulars, and less than 200 Virginians, made up the army of Colonel\r\nBouquet, which advanced from Fort Pitt in October, 1764, and marched\r\nninety-six miles to Muskingum, mostly through a wilderness which the\r\nsavages had deemed their sure defense.\r\n\r\nThis expedition appearing in such force in the heart of the enemy’s\r\ncountry overawed the Indians, who sued for peace. The Delaware, Shawnee\r\nand Seneca agreed to cease hostilities. Many white people held as\r\nprisoners were liberated.\r\n\r\nSo thoroughly is Pennsylvania entitled to the credit of this successful\r\nexpedition, which not only restored so many of her men, women and\r\nchildren to their families, but it had the chief part in securing peace\r\nto the adjoining colonies.\r\n\r\nThe Legislatures of Maryland and Virginia did not contribute a penny to\r\nthe expense, but left Colonel Bouquet personally liable for the pay of\r\nthe volunteers from those provinces. The Pennsylvania Assembly in due\r\ntime came to his relief, and also paid for this.\r\n\r\nBy the agreement of 1760 the Assembly was allowed to tax the\r\nProprietaries’ lands upon certain conditions. The Assembly tried to have\r\nthe language of the bill changed so that the Proprietaries’ land would\r\nnot be taxed “only as high as the worst lands owned by the settlers” was\r\ntaxed, but no such change was allowed.\r\n\r\nIndeed, harmony was scarcely to be expected between one of the\r\nProprietary family, as Governor on the one side, and the Assembly on the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly was compelled to yield to the necessities of the province,\r\nbut the conduct of Governor John Penn so incensed the Assembly, that it\r\nwas determined by a large majority to petition the King to purchase the\r\njurisdiction of the province from the Proprietaries, and vest the\r\nGovernment directly in the Crown.\r\n\r\nJoseph Galloway sponsored the resolutions which resulted in the petition\r\nbeing signed by three thousand five hundred persons and addressed to\r\nKing George III.\r\n\r\nThere was much opposition from leading men in the province against\r\nthrowing off the proprietary dominion, and these were not alone of the\r\nQuaker belief.\r\n\r\nIsaac Norris, the venerable Speaker; John Dickinson, afterwards\r\ndistinguished in the Revolution; the Reverend Gilbert Tennant, and the\r\nReverend Francis Allison, representing the Presbyterian interest, with\r\nWilliam Allen, Chief Justice, and afterward father-in-law of Governor\r\nJohn Penn, were strong leaders in opposition to the measure.\r\n\r\nThe Quakers, on the other hand, supported it, and were sustained by\r\nseveral successive Assemblies. The argument which lined up the\r\nPresbyterians with those who opposed the change in Government was the\r\nimportant question of defending the province, and particularly their\r\nbrethren on the frontiers. It mattered comparatively little whether the\r\nProprietaries or the richer inhabitants paid for this protection.\r\n\r\nThey also feared that under the Crown the Church of England might become\r\nthe Established Church. The majority, which wished to divest the\r\nFounder’s descendants of their authority, were the strict followers of\r\nthe Founder’s religion.\r\n\r\nDickinson was re-elected to the Assembly, as was Norris, even though he\r\ndid not desire to return to that body. Galloway and Franklin were\r\ndefeated, the latter by twenty-five majority out of 4000 votes. Only two\r\nof the ten members from Philadelphia were in favor of the change of\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nNorris was again elected Speaker, but dissensions arose which caused him\r\nto resign the speakership, when Joseph Fox was elected to succeed him.\r\nHe appointed Dr. Franklin as an additional provincial agent in London,\r\nand directed him to go with all dispatch, and urge the adoption of the\r\nmeasure before the British Ministry.\r\n\r\nFranklin sailed for England on November 8, 1764, being escorted by 300\r\nadmirers, to Chester, where he embarked.\r\n\r\nHe took with him a copy of the resolution which the Assembly, upon\r\nhearing of the proposal in England of a stamp act or some other means of\r\nrevenue had passed, acknowledged it a duty to grant aid to the Crown,\r\naccording to ability, whenever required in the usual constitutional\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nFranklin found, on his arrival at London, that he had to contend with a\r\npower far stronger and more obstinate than the Proprietaries themselves,\r\neven with the very power whose protection he had come to seek.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Governor Simon Snyder, Prey of Kidnappers,\r\n                         Died November 9, 1819\r\n\r\n\r\nSimon Snyder, three times Governor of Pennsylvania, was born in\r\nLancaster County, November 5, 1749, and died in his beautiful stone\r\nmansion in Selinsgrove November 9, 1819.\r\n\r\nSnyder had been defeated in the gubernatorial contest of 1805, but his\r\nelection was not long delayed.\r\n\r\nAlderman John Binns, editor of the Democratic Press, then the most\r\npowerful political leader in the State, was Snyder’s closest friend and\r\nadviser and soon influenced such a current of popular sentiment toward\r\nhis friend’s candidacy that William J. Duane and Dr. Michael Leib were\r\ncompelled to support Snyder even though they realized Binns would be\r\nmore potent in guiding his Administration.\r\n\r\nSnyder carried every county except six and defeated James Ross by 28,400\r\nvotes.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the election occurred than the Governor was importuned to\r\nappoint Dr. Lieb to the office of Secretary of the Commonwealth, but the\r\nastute Executive named N. B. Boileau, of Montgomery County, to that\r\nimportant place.\r\n\r\nGovernor Snyder was re-elected in 1811 and again in 1814, being the last\r\nGovernor of Pennsylvania to serve three terms.\r\n\r\nThere were many thrilling events during the nine years of his\r\nAdministration, the most important of which was the War of 1812–14.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Executive of no State in the Union performed his part more\r\npatriotically or with a firmer determination than did Governor Snyder.\r\n\r\nA month before the formal declaration of our second war with England he\r\nhad issued an order drafting 14,000 men as the quota of Pennsylvania for\r\nthe general defense. His several addresses to the Legislature were of\r\nthe most patriotic fervor and he deserved the hearty support which was\r\ngenerously given him.\r\n\r\nDuring the trying period of the war, Governor Snyder exhibited many\r\nsplendid traits of character, and met every emergency with determined\r\ncourage and the consciousness of having performed his full duty.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania has been remarkably free from crimes against officials\r\nholding high office, and yet the nearest attempt was a plot to kidnap\r\nGovernor Snyder.\r\n\r\nEarly in the year of 1816 Richard Smith, as principal in the first\r\ndegree, and Ann Carson, in the second degree, were tried in Philadelphia\r\nbefore the Hon. Jacob Rush and his associates for the murder of John\r\nCarson, her husband. The trial resulted in the conviction of Smith and\r\nthe acquittal of Ann Carson.\r\n\r\nRichard Smith was a lieutenant in the Twenty-third Infantry Regiment U.\r\nS. A. He was of Irish descent, a nephew of Daniel Clark, of New Orleans,\r\nand heir to his estate, worth in excess of $1,000,000.\r\n\r\nAnn Carson was the most captivating beauty of the underworld and the\r\nmost notorious character in the State, according to the newspapers of a\r\ncentury ago. She married a Scotchman, Captain John Carson, a dissipated\r\nex-captain of the United States Navy, who was nearly twice her age.\r\n\r\nSeveral years after this marriage Captain Carson sailed for China, in\r\ncommand of the ship Ganges, and nothing more was heard of him for four\r\nor five years, and his wife believed he had perished at sea.\r\n\r\nDuring his absence Ann Carson became infatuated with the dashing young\r\nLieutenant Smith, who occupied an apartment in her home.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1815 Captain Carson appeared at the home and his\r\nestranged wife had no welcome for him.\r\n\r\nFor the following several months the trio lived a life of continual\r\nstrife. One evening in January, 1816, the two men met in the parlor of\r\nthe Carson home on Second and Dock Streets, when Smith shot and killed\r\nCarson.\r\n\r\nThe murderer was taken before Alderman Binns, who committed him to\r\nprison on a charge of murder. As already stated, Smith was convicted and\r\nMrs. Carson acquitted.\r\n\r\nMrs. Carson immediately planned to save Smith from the scaffold. She was\r\nable to command the services of the most desperate criminals.\r\n\r\nBoth Smith and Mrs. Carson knew that the Alderman and editor had great\r\ninfluence with Governor Snyder, and their first effort was to bring\r\npressure upon him to obtain a pardon for the condemned man.\r\n\r\nBinns refused to interfere, and in addition published a caustic warning\r\nagainst any attempt to stay the course of justice. Never had there been\r\nso much feeling manifested in the desire to obtain a pardon for murder\r\nas on this occasion.\r\n\r\nAnn Carson conceived the scheme to kidnap Binns and hold him as a\r\nhostage for Smith. This plan failed. Then the desperate criminals\r\nendeavored to coerce Binns into their measures by planning to kidnap his\r\nson, who had been christened Snyder, after the then Governor. The boy\r\nwas not quite six years old, but daily went to his school.\r\n\r\nThis plot was communicated to Binns and the child was kept in his home,\r\nand that plot also failed.\r\n\r\nThen the notorious and desperate Ann Carson determined to kidnap the\r\nGovernor himself, and keep him in custody, under a threat of being put\r\nto death, if he did not grant a pardon for Smith.\r\n\r\nThe very night this scheme was determined on, it was, through a\r\nlay-cousin of Lieutenant Smith’s, communicated to John Binns, who\r\nimmediately dispatched the details of the plot to the Governor, who was\r\nthen at his home in Selinsgrove.\r\n\r\nAnn Carson, accompanied by two ruffians named “Lige” Brown and Henry\r\nWay, set out from Philadelphia on horseback to Selinsgrove. At\r\nLancaster, Way robbed a drover, but was badly beaten over the head and\r\neasily captured. The others, however, made their escape and proceeded on\r\ntheir nefarious errand.\r\n\r\nGovernor Snyder hastened to Harrisburg, where he swore out a warrant\r\nagainst the woman, and she was apprehended and held in $5000 bail, which\r\nwas furnished by her friends. She returned to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nWay escaped from jail after nearly killing his jailer and was never\r\ncaptured. Lieutenant Smith was executed.\r\n\r\nMrs. Carson’s subsequent career was merely a succession of crimes, in\r\nwhich she affected the disguise of a demure Quakeress. It was in this\r\ndisguise she was detected passing a counterfeit note on the Girard Bank.\r\nShe was sentenced to seven years in the Walnut Street prison.\r\n\r\nA writer says she was appointed matron in the women’s ward, where her\r\ncruel treatment drove the female convicts to revolt and that Mrs. Carson\r\nwas killed during one of these uprisings.\r\n\r\nJohn Binns in his “Recollections” says that while in prison she was a\r\nkind and most attentive nurse.\r\n\r\nThe latter is true. Ann Carson died in prison April 27, 1824, of typhus\r\nfever, which she contracted while nursing other victims of the plague.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  John Dickinson Writes First “Farmer”\r\n                       Letter, November 10, 1767\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1767 a bill was passed by Parliament which affirmed its right “to\r\nbind the Colonies in all cases whatsoever” and levied duties on tea,\r\npaper, glass and painters’ colors imported into the Colonies from Great\r\nBritain, payable in America. This act, with several others, rekindled\r\nthe opposition of the Colonies. Again associations were formed to\r\nprevent the importation of British goods and meetings called to resolve,\r\npetition and remonstrate.\r\n\r\nThe first of the “Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania to the\r\nInhabitants of the British Colonies,” appeared November 10, 1767, the\r\nauthorship of which gave John Dickinson, of Philadelphia, so much of his\r\ncelebrity.\r\n\r\nThey were published in every colony, also in London, and afterwards\r\ntranslated into French in Paris.\r\n\r\nDr. Benjamin Franklin, who had formerly been an enemy of Dickinson wrote\r\nthe preface to the London edition; while the people of Boston, assembled\r\nin a town meeting, voted Dickinson their thanks.\r\n\r\nLetter No. 1 began: “My Dear Countrymen: I am a farmer, settled, after a\r\nvariety of fortunes, near the banks of the Delaware, in the Province of\r\nPennsylvania. I received a liberal education, and have been engaged in\r\nbusy scenes of life; but am now convinced that a man may be as happy\r\nwithout bustle as with it.\r\n\r\n“My farm is small; my servants few and good; I have a little money at\r\ninterest; I wish for no more; my employment in my own affairs is easy;\r\nand with a contented, grateful mind, undisturbed by worldly hopes or\r\nfears, relating to myself, I am completing the number of days allotted\r\nto me by Divine goodness.”\r\n\r\nEvery man ought to espouse the sacred cause of liberty to the extent of\r\nhis powers and “The Farmer” offered some thoughts on late transactions,\r\npraying that his lines might be read with the same zeal for the\r\nhappiness of British America with which they had been written.\r\n\r\nHe had observed that little notice had been taken of the Act of\r\nParliament for suspending the legislation of New York. This was\r\npunishment for noncompliance by the Assembly of that Province with a\r\nformer act requiring certain provisions to be made for the troops. To\r\ncompel the colonies to furnish certain articles for the troops was, he\r\nproceeded to show, taxation in another form and New York was being\r\npunished for resisting such taxation.\r\n\r\nIn Letter No. 2, the “Farmer” took up the Act imposing duties on paper,\r\nglass, etc., which he deemed a most dangerous innovation upon the old\r\npractice of imposing duties merely for the regulation of trade.\r\n\r\nParliament had a right to regulate the trade of the colonies; but here\r\nit was vowing the design of raising revenues from America; a right,\r\nwhich, America felt, was inherent in her own representatives. This\r\ntaxation was attempted by the device of levying duties on certain\r\narticles imported to the colonies. The effect of this was clearly\r\npointed out.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain had prohibited certain manufactures in the colonies, and\r\nhad prohibited the purchase of such manufactured goods except from the\r\nmother country.\r\n\r\n“If you once admit that Great Britain may lay duties upon her\r\nexportations to us, for the purpose of levying money on us only,” he\r\nwrote, “she will then have nothing to do but to lay those duties on the\r\narticles, which she prohibits us to manufacture—and the tragedy of\r\nAmerican liberty is finished.”\r\n\r\nIn Letter No. 3 the “Farmer” explained there were other modes of\r\nresistance to oppression than any breach of peace and deprecated, as\r\nDickinson did ever afterward, any attempt to make the colonies\r\nindependent.\r\n\r\n“If once we are separated from our mother country,” he said, “what new\r\nform of government shall we adopt, or where shall we find another\r\nBritain to supply our loss? Torn from the body to which we are united by\r\nreligion, liberty, laws, affections, relation, language and commerce, we\r\nmust bleed at every vein.”\r\n\r\nIn the subsequent letters, the dangers to American liberty were\r\nexpiated, objections answered and the people urged to make a stand for\r\nthemselves and their posterity peaceably, prudently, firmly, jointly.\r\n“You are assigned by Divine Providence, in the appointed orders of\r\nthings the protectors of unborn ages, whose fate depends upon your\r\nvirtue,” he said. “Whether they shall arise the generous and\r\nindisputable heirs of the noblest patrimonies or the dastardly and\r\nhereditary drudges of imperious taskmasters, you must determine.”\r\n\r\nThe effect of the Farmer’s letters was tremendous. About this time a\r\nletter to Governor Penn arrived from the Earl of Hillsborough, dated\r\nApril 21, 1768, informing him that King George III considered the\r\ncircular letter from the Massachusetts Legislature, calling upon the\r\nother colonies to send commissioners to New York City to consider a\r\nunited representation to the King and Parliament to be of a most\r\ndangerous and factious tendency, and that Governor Penn should exert his\r\ninfluence to prevail upon the Assembly of Pennsylvania to take no notice\r\nof it, and to prorogue or dissolve that body.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly, September 16, resolved that the Governor had no authority\r\nto prorogue or dissolve and that it was the undoubted right of the\r\nAssembly to correspond with any of the American colonies to obtain by\r\ndecent petitions to the King and Parliament redress of any grievances.\r\n\r\nFour days later the Assembly addressed a petition to the King, the\r\nfollowing day one to the House of Lords and another to the House of\r\nCommons. Each of these paraphrased in softer language and adapted to\r\nPennsylvania the latter from Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nThe petition to the King referred to the settlement of the province when\r\nit was only a wilderness with a view of enjoying that liberty, civil and\r\nreligious, of which the petitioners’ ancestors were in a great measure\r\ndeprived in their native land, and also to extend the British empire,\r\nincrease its commerce and promote its wealth and power.\r\n\r\nWith inexpressible labor, toil and expense, and without assistance from\r\nthe mother country, that wilderness had been peopled, planted and\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\nIt was conceived that by no act had the people surrendered up or\r\nforfeited their rights and liberties as natural-born subjects of the\r\nBritish Government; but those rights had been brought over and were\r\nvested by inheritance.\r\n\r\nThe duties and taxes for the sole purpose of raising revenue imposed by\r\nparliament upon the Americans, they not being represented in that body,\r\nand being taxable only by themselves or their representatives, were\r\ndestructive of those rights and without precedent until the passage of\r\nthe Stamp Act.\r\n\r\nWhenever the King had had occasion for aid to defend and secure the\r\ncolonies, requisitions had been made upon the Pennsylvania Assemblies,\r\nwho with cheerfulness granted them, and “often so liberally as to exceed\r\nthe abilities and circumstances of the people.”\r\n\r\nIt was essential to the liberties of Englishmen that no laws be made\r\nwhich would take away their property without their consent, and even if\r\nthis taxation had been constitutional the present law was injurious to\r\nthe mother country as well as America. And lastly, the revenue was to be\r\napplied in such colonies as it should be thought proper. Thus\r\nPennsylvania would pay, without their consent, taxes which might be\r\napplied to the use of other colonies.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               In Anticipation of War with France General\r\n                  Washington Arrives in Philadelphia,\r\n                           November 11, 1798\r\n\r\n\r\nOn November 11, 1798, General George Washington, who was then\r\nlieutenant-general of the army, arrived in Philadelphia to assume charge\r\nof matters in relation to the threatened war with France, and was\r\nreceived by the troops of horse and a large number of uniformed\r\ncompanies of foot.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th President John Adams, who had left the city on account of\r\nthe recurrence of the yellow fever, returned, and was received with\r\nsalutes from the sloop-of-war “Delaware,” Captain Stephen Decatur, and\r\nCaptain Matthew Hale’s Ninth Company of Philadelphia Artillery, which\r\nwas stationed near Center Square.\r\n\r\nThe presence of John Jay, of New York, in England to make a treaty with\r\nGreat Britain aroused the French to a sense of the importance of\r\nobserving its own treaty stipulations with the United States, which had\r\nbeen utterly disregarded since the war with England began. Jay’s treaty\r\nwith England, November 19, 1794, caused such a division of the Americans\r\nthat they were all either Frenchmen or Englishmen in their politics.\r\n\r\nGenet, the French minister, received the most flattering attention from\r\nthe day he arrived until he was recalled. When Adet, his successor,\r\nordered all Frenchmen in America to wear the tri-colored French cockade,\r\neverybody in Philadelphia wore it.\r\n\r\nOn January 4, 1795, a new decree was issued, giving full force and\r\neffect to those clauses of the treaty of commerce, signed in 1778, with\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of the failure of the Americans to elect Thomas Jefferson\r\nPresident reached France, the Directory issued a decree, March 2, 1797,\r\npurporting to define the authority granted to French cruisers by a\r\nformer decree. It was intended to annihilate American commerce in\r\nEuropean waters.\r\n\r\nThe treaty with America was modified as to make American vessels liable\r\nto capture for any cause recognized as lawful ground of capture by Jay’s\r\ntreaty.\r\n\r\nThey also decreed that any Americans found serving on board hostile\r\nowned vessels should be treated as pirates; in other words, American\r\nseamen, impressed by the British, were made liable to be hanged by the\r\nFrench.\r\n\r\nOn January 18, 1798, a sweeping decree against American commerce was\r\npromulgated by the French Directory.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this insolent attitude of the French Directory and the\r\ncontinued seizures of American vessels by French cruisers, the\r\npopularity of France had declined, and it soon became evident that the\r\ncountry was slowly but surely drifting into war.\r\n\r\nOn March 5, 1798, President Adams informed Congress of the failure of\r\nthe mission of the American Envoys, and accompanying this information\r\nwas a message from the French Directory to the Council of Five Hundred\r\nurging the passage of further objectionable laws against American\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nA few days later Congress was informed that the representatives of\r\nPrince Talleyrand, one of the French ministers, had demanded a bribe of\r\n£50,000 for the members of the Directory and a loan to the Republic, in\r\nconsideration of the adoption of a satisfactory treaty.\r\n\r\nGreat excitement was caused by the publication of these facts. In every\r\nsection of the country was re-echoed the vigorous language of Charles\r\nPinckney: “Millions for defense, but not one cent for tribute.”\r\n\r\nGovernor Mifflin and his associates in the State Government openly\r\nsympathized with France, and in the Pennsylvania Senate the feeling in\r\nfavor of France was still very strong. On March 20 that body adopted\r\nresolutions declaring that the representatives of Pennsylvania bear\r\ntheir public testimony against war in any shape or with any nation\r\nunless the territories of the United States shall be invaded, but more\r\nespecially against the people with whom our hearts and hands have been\r\nlately united in friendship.\r\n\r\nIn the House, however, the resolutions were received and laid upon the\r\ntable, but never taken up for consideration.\r\n\r\nThe councils of Philadelphia passed resolutions in favor of sustaining\r\nfriendly relations with France, but strongly endorsed the Federal\r\nadministration in its conduct of the matter. A great meeting of the\r\nmerchants and traders of Philadelphia was held, April 11, when an\r\naddress to the President was adopted, which expressed regret at the\r\nfailure of the negotiations with France, and their determination to\r\nsupport the Government.\r\n\r\nPopular indignation at the conduct of France was rapidly intensifying,\r\nand the publication of a new patriotic song, “Hail Columbia,” greatly\r\nstimulated the agitation.\r\n\r\nAt the request of Gilbert Fox, a young actor, Joseph Hopkinson, of\r\nPhiladelphia, then twenty-eight years of age, wrote “Hail Columbia” to\r\naccompany the air of “The President’s March,” which had become very\r\npopular in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThis new song was first sung by Fox at his benefit in the theater, April\r\n25, 1798, and excited the wildest applause. The words were caught up and\r\nrepeated throughout the country.\r\n\r\nAmong other demonstrations in support of the Government was a meeting of\r\nyouths between eighteen and twenty-three years of age, April 28, at\r\nJames Cameron’s tavern.\r\n\r\nResolutions were passed approving the action of the Federal Government,\r\nand a committee was appointed to prepare an address to the President. On\r\nMay 7, more than twelve hundred of them each wearing a black cockade\r\nmarched in procession to the home of President Adams.\r\n\r\nOn the following night parties of men wearing the French cockades\r\nappeared on the streets and made some disorder, in consequence of which\r\nthe Citizens’ Volunteers were placed on guard at the mint and arsenal,\r\nand troops of cavalry paraded the streets at night.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers contributed not a little to the excitation of feeling.\r\nEditor William Cobbett was particularly violent and Benjamin Franklin\r\nBache, in the Aurora, was almost as vehement.\r\n\r\nThe citizen military organizations were most active and during the\r\nsummer months assembled frequently and performed various evolutions.\r\n\r\nEarly in June, Governor Mifflin addressed a circular letter to militia\r\nofficers, requesting their co-operation in preparation of measures for\r\ndefense.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for Lieutenant-General Washington and his army soon\r\npassed. The trouble with France was brought to a satisfactory result\r\nthrough diplomatic channels and President Adams issued a proclamation\r\ncalling for a day of solemn humiliation, fasting, and prayer, on April\r\n25, 1799, over the happy event.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  First Jury Drawn in Early Courts of\r\n                     Province on November 12, 1678\r\n\r\n\r\nThe early judicial history of Pennsylvania presents striking features of\r\ninterest to two classes in the community—the professional lawyer and the\r\nstudent of history.\r\n\r\nTo the former it must be a matter of curiosity and interest to study the\r\nfirst rude means devised to administer justice between man and man—to\r\ndiscern among the transactions of those early times the rise and\r\ndevelopment of institutions and practices.\r\n\r\nBut to the student of history the subject affords a different kind of\r\ninterest. He finds gratification in the manner, customs and modes of\r\nthought once prevalent in these early courts.\r\n\r\nIn them he finds traces of the past life of the Nation, learns of the\r\nmatters which then interested the people, the nature of their\r\nindustries, the extent of their commerce, the character of their\r\neducation, the attention paid to their morals, and even the depth of\r\ntheir religious convictions.\r\n\r\nThe early courts of what is now Pennsylvania had their origin in 1673,\r\nunder the government of James, Duke of York.\r\n\r\nAfter the Swedish settlements on the Delaware were conquered by the\r\nDutch, the Swedes were directed to concentrate in villages, but they\r\nnever did so. Among the places named for this purpose was Upland, now\r\nChester.\r\n\r\nThe Swedish magistrates were permitted to remain in office—a\r\nconciliatory policy which was imitated by the English when they came\r\ninto possession of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch divided the western shore of the Delaware into three counties\r\nor judicial districts, the most northern of which was called Ophlandt,\r\nits capital being Upland. This division was recognized and continued by\r\nthe English.\r\n\r\nIn 1676, under Governor Andross, the Magistrates of Upland were Peter\r\nCock (Cox), Peter Rambo, Israel Helm, Lace Andries, Oele Swen, and Otto\r\nErnest Cock, all Swedes.\r\n\r\nAt the court at Upland, November 13, 1677, Captain Hans Jargin was\r\nordered “to fit up the House of Defense for the use of the court at its\r\nnext sitting.” The court previously had been holding its sessions at the\r\nhouse of Neeles Laersen, who kept a tavern, a troublesome fellow, whose\r\ndaughter seems to have taken after her father, both having appeared\r\nseveral times in court.\r\n\r\nOn November 12, 1678, complaint was made against Laersen for building a\r\nfence which stopped the usual path of travel over the meadow. The Court\r\nordered him to remove the obstruction.\r\n\r\nAt the same session of court the case of William Orian vs. John D'haes\r\nwas called. It was an action on a book account for the sum of 167\r\nguilders, and the first jury known to have been called in Pennsylvania\r\nwas impaneled.\r\n\r\nThe names of these original jurymen were Hans Moens, Dunk Williams,\r\nXtopper Barnes, Edmund Draufton, Peter Jockum, Isaac Sanoy, Jan\r\nHendricks, Jonas Kien, Moens Cock, John Browne, Jan Boelson and Henry\r\nHastings.\r\n\r\nThe verdict was for the plaintiff for the full amount of his claim which\r\nhad been disputed.\r\n\r\nThese early county courts were vested with criminal jurisdiction in all\r\nsave cases of heinous or enormous crimes. Treason, murder and\r\nmanslaughter were outside their cognizance. Trials for larceny,\r\nswearing, laboring on the first day of the week, assault and battery,\r\nshooting or maiming the prosecutor’s hogs, unduly encouraging\r\ndrunkenness, selling rum to the Indians and offenses against the public\r\nmorality and decency constituted the great bulk of the criminal\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n“Lying in conversation” was fined half a crown, “drinking healths which\r\nmay provoke people to unnecessary and excessive drinking” was fined five\r\nshillings, while the sale of beer made of molasses at more than a penny\r\na quart was visited with a like penalty of five shillings for every\r\nquart sold.\r\n\r\nNo person could “Smoak tobacco in the streets of Philadelphia or New\r\nCastle, by day or by night,” on penalty of a fine of twelve pence, to be\r\napplied to the purchase of leather buckets and other instruments against\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nAny person “convicted at playing of cards, dice, lotteries or such-like\r\nenticing, vain and evil sports and games” was to pay five shillings or\r\nto be imprisoned five days at hard labor, while those who introduced or\r\nfrequented “such rude and riotous sports and practices as prizes, stage\r\nplays, masques, revels, bull baitings, cock fightings and the like” were\r\neither to forfeit twenty shillings or to be imprisoned at hard labor for\r\nten days.\r\n\r\nSmoking tobacco in the courtroom was an heinous offense. Luke Watson,\r\nhimself a Justice, twice offended the Court on the same day in this\r\nmanner and was fined the first time fifty pounds of tobacco, the second\r\n100 pounds. In 1687 William Bradford was fined for swearing in the\r\npresence of the Justices, and Thomas Hasellum was fined for singing and\r\nmaking a noise.\r\n\r\nThomas Jones, who was wanted in court as a witness, was a hardened\r\ncharacter and refused to appear. When two constables brought him into\r\ncourt he cursed at a horrible rate.\r\n\r\nThe records state “said Jones being brought into court, the Court told\r\nhim of his misdemeanor, and told him he should suffer for it; he told\r\nthe Court he questioned their power, so the Court ordered the Sheriff\r\nand constable to secure him and they carried and dragged him to ye Smith\r\nShop, where they put irons upon him, but he quickly got the Irons off\r\nand Escaped, he having before wounded several persons’ legs with his\r\nspurs that strived with him, and when they was goeing to put him in the\r\nStocks, before that they put him in Irons, he kicked the Sheriff on the\r\nmouth and was very unruly and abusive, and soon got out of the Stocks.”\r\n\r\nAn excellent law in the early days of the Province provided “that\r\nwhereas there was a necessity for the sake of commerce in this infancy\r\nof things, that the growth and produce of this Province should pass in\r\nlieu of money, that, therefore, all merchantable wheat, rye, Indian\r\ncorn, barley, oats, pork, beef and tobacco should pass current at the\r\nmarket price.”\r\n\r\nOf this provision the people availed themselves largely. They frequently\r\ngave bonds to each other acknowledging their debts in kinds. Judgments\r\nwere accordingly sometimes entered “for 172 pounds of pork and two\r\nbushels of wheat, being the balance of an account brought into court,”\r\nor for “32 shillings for a gun, and 150 pounds of pork for a shirt,”\r\nwhile, perhaps, the climax is reached in an entry of judgment for “One\r\nthousand of six-penny nails, and three bottles of rum.”\r\n\r\nThe early Provincial Courts were unusual peace makers and made peculiar\r\nawards.\r\n\r\nIn Chester County, in 1687, in an action of an assault and battery by\r\nSamuel Baker against Samuel Rowland was this award: “Samuel Rowland\r\nshall pay the lawful charges of this court, and give the said Samuel\r\nBaker a Hatt, and so Discharge each other of all manner of Differences\r\nfrom the Beginning of the World to this Present day.”\r\n\r\nThe sentences imposed were not unusually severe. The whipping post, the\r\npillory and the imposition of fines were usually resorted to as\r\npunishments in preference to long terms of imprisonment. The services of\r\nthe culprit were more desirable than to keep him within a prison’s\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Council of Censors First Met Under Constitution\r\n                       of 1776, November 13, 1783\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of 1776, as would be expected, was hastily prepared.\r\nGreat excitement prevailed everywhere throughout the Province and the\r\ndocument was adopted with the same determined spirit which characterized\r\nall public movements during that thrilling period of our history.\r\n\r\nNothing less than the impending war for liberty could justify the\r\nmethods that were employed to change the frame of government under which\r\nthe people had lived for nearly a century.\r\n\r\nThe most effective improvement in this instrument could have been made\r\nby amendment in the regular manner, but this method would not have\r\nserved to satisfy the determined purposes of the leaders of that day.\r\n\r\nThe chief objections to the Constitution were the existence of a single\r\nlegislative body, and a council of censors consisting of two men from\r\neach city and county in the State to hold office for seven years.\r\n\r\nThe function of the censors were of a most extraordinary character. The\r\nmembers were to meet annually, and inquire whether the Constitution had\r\nbeen kept inviolate; whether the legislative and executive branches had\r\ncarefully functioned; whether taxes had been justly levied and\r\ncollected, etc. A majority vote of their number was sufficient to\r\ndetermine every action, excepting the calling of a convention to revise\r\nthe Constitution, which alone required the consent of two-thirds of the\r\ncouncil.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that George Bryan and James Cannon were the authors of\r\nthis unusual provision. Both were ardent patriots.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution fairly reflected the political opinions of those\r\nopposed to the English Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe office of Governor was swept away, and the Constitution of 1776\r\nprovided that the Supreme Executive Council should choose one of its\r\nnumber President, whose duties were those of the Chief Executive.\r\n\r\nEvery effort to secure a revision of the Constitution proved unavailing\r\nand public opinion waited impatiently for the first seven years to pass,\r\nin the hopes that a revision would then be possible. If the enemies of\r\nthe Constitution were numerous and bitter, it had also many enthusiastic\r\nsupporters.\r\n\r\nThe Council of Censors assembled, as the Constitution required, on\r\nNovember 13, 1783, and continuing in session nearly a year, adjourned\r\nfinally September 25, 1784. Frederick A. Muhlenberg was elected\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nVarious amendments were discussed and strong difference of opinion\r\nmanifested, but in the address of the freemen of the Commonwealth of\r\nPennsylvania, at the close of their labors, they recommended a\r\ncontinuance of the frame of government.\r\n\r\nThey say, “if with heart and hand united, we will all combine to support\r\nthe Constitution, and apply its injunction to the best use of society,\r\nwe shall find it a source of the richest blessings. We would earnestly\r\nrecommend this to you. Give it a fair and honest trial; and if after\r\nall, at the end of another seven years, it shall be found necessary or\r\nproper to introduce any changes, they may then be brought in, and\r\nestablished upon a full conviction of their usefulness, with harmony and\r\ngood temper, without noise, tumult, or violence.”\r\n\r\nA majority of the members favored amending the Constitution, so that the\r\nLegislature should consist of a house of representatives of 100 members\r\nand a legislative council of twenty-nine members; that the executive\r\npower be vested in a Governor with a veto power; that the Judges should\r\nbe appointed by the Governor to serve during good behavior, with fixed\r\nsalaries and that the Council of Censors should be abolished.\r\n\r\nTwelve Councilors favored and nine opposed these amendments, a\r\ntwo-thirds vote could not be had. The majority issued an appeal, as did\r\nthe minority. Then followed a pamphlet war on the action of the\r\nconvention, lasting all summer. It was not, however, especially bitter.\r\n\r\nOn resuming its sessions the Council then assumed its rights under the\r\nConstitution, but could arrive at no definite conclusion, and finally\r\nresolved “that there does not appear to this Council an absolute\r\nnecessity to call a convention to alter or explain or amend the\r\nConstitution.” This report was adopted by a vote of 14 to 8, a marked\r\nchange in the opinion of some of the censors since their previous\r\naction.\r\n\r\nThis change was occasioned by the people. A petition signed by 18,000\r\npersons had been sent to the Council of Censors, opposing all changes in\r\nthe Constitution. Then, too, George Bryan had been elected from\r\nPhiladelphia to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of a\r\nConservative. Bryan was a radical of the radicals, and his election was\r\nsensed as an indication of the drift of public sentiment.\r\n\r\nPresident Muhlenberg admitted early in the summer that the Conservatives\r\nwere beaten, and attributed it to the “blind passion and mad party\r\nspirit of the common crowd.” General Joseph Reed thought their chief\r\nmistake was in presenting too many amendments. Bryan was severely\r\nattacked, and was characterized as the censor general of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nIn justification of their cause the censors simply issued an address to\r\nthe people and then adjourned. They admitted that there were defects in\r\nthe Constitution, but they could not agree on the changes. Even this\r\naddress lacked unanimity, for twelve voted for it and nine opposed it.\r\nThus the Constitution, which had been assailed so long, weathered the\r\nfirst storm and still remained unchanged.\r\n\r\nThe discontent with the Constitution did not die with the inaction of\r\nthe censors. The old confederation was now expiring and the chaos was\r\nbecoming darker than ever. Finally when all authority was gone, and the\r\npeople had suffered enough for the lack of it, they were willing to\r\nadopt another constitution containing the principles of enduring life.\r\n\r\nThe movement that led to the ratification of the Federal Constitution by\r\nPennsylvania gave the proponents of a new constitution the suggestion\r\nthat a convention should be called to adopt another constitution for\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe necessary steps were then taken, and the Legislature, acting upon\r\npetitions addressed to it, after many heated debates, reported the\r\nresolutions from the Committee of the Whole with favorable\r\nrecommendations.\r\n\r\nBy this time it was clearly evident the majority of the people desired\r\nthis in preference to a new Constitution made by the Council of Censors.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Bill of Rights recognized the people as possessed of\r\nall the necessary powers in the premises. The report recommended a plan\r\nfor the election of members to the proposed convention, and method of\r\nprocedure. The resolution was adopted by a vote of 39 to 17.\r\n\r\nThe learned members of the Council of Censors did not agree; indeed,\r\nthere was a strong and general feeling, especially among the most\r\ninfluential and intelligent, that the Constitution of 1776 was\r\ninadequate, and was still more so since the close of the war, when the\r\nsituation was entirely changed. On November 24, 1789, the convention met\r\nto revise the Constitution.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Indian Outrages in Berks County Began\r\n                           November 14, 1755\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first violent outbreak by the Indians in Berks County, after the\r\ndefeat of General Braddock in July, 1775, occurred in the vicinity of\r\nDeitrick Six’s plantation, near what is now the village of Millersburg,\r\nin Bethel Township. This tragedy occurred November 14, 1755.\r\n\r\nConrad Weiser, who resided in what is now Womeldsdorf, frequently\r\naccompanied bands of friendly Indians on important missions to\r\nPhiladelphia, but after many cruel murders had been committed upon the\r\nsettlers, the inhabitants turned against Weiser, believing him to be\r\nprotecting Indians who did not deserve it.\r\n\r\nThe redskins all looked alike to the sturdy settlers, who so frequently\r\nlost their own lives, or those of their dear ones, or suffered the\r\ndestruction of their homes and barns at the hands of these treacherous\r\nsavages.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt of the loyalty of Colonel Weiser and his brave sons,\r\nwho were ever on the alert to help others in distress or travel to the\r\nseat of government and plead the cause of the less fortunate.\r\n\r\nUpon his return home from a trip to Philadelphia, while the trusted\r\nChief Scarouady and his friendly Delaware Indians were still under the\r\nshelter of Weiser’s roof, his two sons, Philip and Frederic, just home\r\nfrom a scouting expedition, related the story of the terrible massacre,\r\nwhich they had received from the lips of those who felt the cruel blow,\r\nbut escaped death at the hands of the Indians.\r\n\r\nThe story they related to their father was immediately sent by him to\r\nGovernor Morris. The facts are of interest.\r\n\r\nSix of the settlers were on the road going to Deitrick Six’s plantation\r\nwhen a party of Indians fired upon them. The frightened white men\r\nhurried toward a watchhouse, a half mile distant, but were ambushed\r\nbefore reaching their haven of refuge and three of the party were killed\r\nand scalped. A man named Ury shot an Indian through the heart and his\r\nbody was dragged off by the savages, but it was found by the whites the\r\nnext day, when a dead Indian lost his scalp.\r\n\r\nAfter this attack the Indians divided themselves in two parties. The one\r\nprowling around the watchhouse overtook some settlers fleeing toward\r\nthat place, when they killed three of them, making six of the\r\ninhabitants killed by the Indians within an hour’s time.\r\n\r\nOn the following night the Indians crept up in the darkness to the home\r\nof Thomas Bower, on Swatara Creek, pushed their guns through a window\r\nand killed a cobbler, who was at work repairing a shoe. They also set\r\nfire to Bower’s house before being driven away.\r\n\r\nThe Bower family sought refuge through the night in the home of Daniel\r\nSnyder, a neighbor, and returning to their home in the morning, they saw\r\nfour skulking Indians running away, who had with them the scalps just\r\ntaken from the heads of three children, two being yet alive. They also\r\nran across the body of a woman who had just been killed, with a\r\ntwo-weeks old baby under her body, but unhurt.\r\n\r\nColonel Weiser dispatched a second letter the same day to Governor\r\nMorris in which he wrote:\r\n\r\n“That night after my arrival from Philadelphia, Emanuel Carpenter and\r\nSimon Adam Kuhn, Esqr’s., came to my House and lodged with me. They\r\nacquainted me that a meeting was appointed of the people of Tulpenhacon\r\nand Heidelberg and adjacent places in Tulpenhacon Township at Benjamin\r\nSpicker’s early next morning. I made all the haste with the Indians I\r\ncould, and gave them a letter to Thos. McKee, to furnish them with\r\nnecessaries for their journey. Scarouady had no creature to ride on. I\r\ngave him one.\r\n\r\n“Before I could get done with the Indians 3 or 4 Men came from Benja.\r\nSpickers to warn the Indians not to go that way, for the People were so\r\nenraged against all the Indians & would kill them without distinction. I\r\nwent with them; so did the Gentlemen before named.\r\n\r\n“When we came near Benjamin Spickers I saw about 400 or 500 men, and\r\nthere was loud noise, I rode before, and in riding along the road and\r\narmed men on both Sides of the Road I heard some say, why must we be\r\nkilled by the Indians and we not kill them? Why are our Hands so tied?\r\n\r\n“I got the Indians to the House with much adoe, where I treated them\r\nwith a small Dram, and so parted in Love and Friendship. Capt’n\r\nDiefenbach undertook to conduct them, with five other men, to the\r\nSusquehanna. After this a sort of a counsel of war was held by the\r\nofficers present, the before named and other Freeholders.\r\n\r\n“It was agreed that 150 men should be raised immediately to serve as out\r\nscouts, and as Guards at Certain Places under the Kittitany Hills for 40\r\ndays. That those so raised to have 2 Shillings a Day & 2 Pounds of\r\nBread, 2 Pounds of Beaff and a Jill of Rum, and Powder and lead. Arms\r\nthey must find themselves.\r\n\r\n“This Scheme was signed by a good many Freeholders and read to the\r\nPeople. They cried out that so much for an Indian Scalp would they have,\r\nbe they Friends or Enemies, from the Governor. I told them I had no such\r\nPower from the Governor nor Assembly. They began, some to Curse the\r\nGovernor; some the Assembly; called me a Traitor of the Country who held\r\nwith the Indians, and must have known this murder beforehand. I sat in\r\nthe House by a Lowe window, some of my friends came to pull me away from\r\nit, telling me some of the people threatened to shoot me.\r\n\r\n“I offered to go out to the People and either Pasefy them or make the\r\nKing’s Proclamation: But those in the House with me would not let me go\r\nout. The cry was, The Land was betrayed and sold. The Common People from\r\nLancaster (now Lebanon County) were the worst. The Wages they said was a\r\nTrifle and some Body pocketed the Rest, and they would resent it. Some\r\nBody had put it in their Head that I had it in my power to give them as\r\nmuch as I pleased. I was in Danger of being Shot to Death.\r\n\r\n“In the mean Time a great smoke arose under Tulpenhacon Mountain, with\r\nthe news following that the Indians had committed a murder on Mill Creek\r\n(a false alarm) and set fire to a Barn, most of the People Ran, and\r\nthose that had Horses Rode off without any Order or Regulation. I then\r\ntook my Horse and went Home, where I intend to stay and defend my own\r\nHouse as long as I can. The People of Tulpenhacon all fled; till about 6\r\nor 7 miles from me some few remains. Another such attack will lay all\r\nthe Country waste on the West side of Schuylkill.”\r\n\r\nThere is undoubted sarcasm in Colonel Weiser’s account of how the people\r\nfled upon the first faint rumor of an Indian attack, after they had made\r\nmob threats against him, yet the gravity of the situation cannot be\r\nquestioned.\r\n\r\nThe principal inhabitants sent a petition to the Governor, November 24,\r\nin which they recited their distress and accurately stated the lack of\r\norder and discipline among the people. They believed a reward should be\r\noffered for Indian scalps.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Indian Shoots at Major Washington While\r\n                     on Important Mission November\r\n                                15, 1753\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Washington had several very narrow escapes from tragic death a\r\nlong time before he led the Continental Army through the eight years of\r\nthe Revolution, and on one occasion was actually shot at by a\r\ntreacherous Indian guide.\r\n\r\nLate in the year of 1753 Governor Dinwiddie dispatched Major Washington\r\non an important mission to the Ohio River, in Pennsylvania, where he was\r\nto convene the Indian chiefs at Logstown, learn from them the designs\r\nand strength of the French; then proceed to the principal French post,\r\npresent his credentials and in the name of his Britannic Majesty demand\r\nthe object of their invasion.\r\n\r\nHe departed from Williamsburg, the seat of Government of Virginia, on\r\nOctober 31, 1753. The route he was to pursue was about 560 miles in\r\ngreat part over high and rugged mountains, and more than half of the way\r\nthrough the heart of the wilderness, where no traces of civilization as\r\nyet appeared.\r\n\r\nHe arrived at Wills Creek, November 15, when John Davidson, an Indian\r\ninterpreter, and Jacob Vanbraam, a Dutchman, but acquainted with the\r\nFrench language, were employed to accompany him. He was also fortunate\r\nin securing the services of Christopher Gist, a surveyor and guide, who\r\nwas always his companion on this mission.\r\n\r\nAt length they arrived at the forks of the Ohio, where Pittsburgh now\r\nstands. Washington was impressed with the advantages it afforded as a\r\nmilitary post.\r\n\r\nThey hastened to Logstown, twenty miles below the forks, where\r\nWashington held conferences with Shingas, Lawmolach and Monakatuatha,\r\nthe Half-King. The latter had been sent by several tribes to the\r\nheadquarters of French, and he related to Washington the substance of\r\nthe speech he made on that mission.\r\n\r\nWashington made a speech to the chiefs, and gave them a belt of wampum.\r\nThe Indians consulted and made a friendly reply and promised an escort\r\nas soon as their young warriors would return from hunting, but\r\nWashington could not wait and on November 30, his party set out,\r\naccompanied by four Indians only, Half-King being of the number.\r\n\r\nThe post of the French Commandant was 120 miles distant and they arrived\r\nthere December 11.\r\n\r\nM. de St. Pierre, the commandant, promised immediate attention to the\r\nletter from Governor Dinwiddie and provided for the comfort of Major\r\nWashington and his party. During the two days the French officers were\r\nframing an answer, Washington examined the fort, and made accurate\r\ndescription of its form and size.\r\n\r\nWashington and Gist clad themselves in Indian dress and set out on foot,\r\nleaving the weak and miserable horses to transport the baggage as best\r\nthey could.\r\n\r\nThe next day an adventure occurred which is well narrated by Mr. Gist in\r\nhis diary:\r\n\r\n“We rose early in the morning, and set out about two o clock, and got to\r\nthe Murdering Town on the southeast fork of Beaver Creek. Here we met\r\nwith an Indian, whom I thought I had seen at Joncaire’s, at Venango,\r\nwhen on our journey up to the French fort.\r\n\r\n“This fellow called me by an Indian name, and pretended to be glad to\r\nsee me. He asked us several questions, as, how we came to travel on\r\nfoot, when we left Venango, where we parted with our horses, and when\r\nthey would be there. Major Washington insisted on traveling by the\r\nnearest way to the Forks of the Allegheny. We asked the Indian if he\r\ncould go with us and show us the nearest way. The Indian seemed very\r\nglad, and ready to go with us; upon which we set out, and the Indian\r\ntook the Major’s pack.\r\n\r\n“We traveled very brisk for eight or ten miles, when the Major’s feet\r\ngrew very sore. The Major desired to encamp; upon which the Indian asked\r\nto carry his gun, but he refused. Then the Indian grew churlish, and\r\npressed us to keep on, telling us there were Ottawa Indians in those\r\nwoods, and they would scalp us if we lay out; but go to his cabin and we\r\nshould be safe.\r\n\r\n“I thought very ill of the fellow, but did not care to let the Major\r\nknow I mistrusted him. But he soon mistrusted him as much as I did. The\r\nIndian said he could hear a gun from his cabin and steered up more\r\nnorthwardly. We grew uneasy and then he said two whoops might be heard\r\nfrom his cabin. We went two miles farther. Then the Major said he would\r\nstay at the next water.\r\n\r\n“We desired the Indian to stop at the next water, but before we came to\r\nwater, we came to a clear meadow. It was very light and snow was on the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n“The Indian made a stop and turned about. The Major saw him point his\r\ngun towards us and he fired. Said the Major, ‘Are you shot?’ ‘No,’ said\r\nI; upon which the Indian ran forward to a big standing light oak and\r\nbegan loading his gun, but we were soon with him. I would have killed\r\nhim, but the Major would not suffer me. We let him charge his gun. We\r\nfound he put in a ball; then we took care of him. Either the Major or I\r\nalways stood by the guns. We made him make a fire for us by a little\r\nrun, as if we intended to sleep there.”\r\n\r\nThe Indian was sent ahead to his cabin and Washington and Gist traveled\r\nall night, reaching Piny Creek in the morning.\r\n\r\nWhether it was the intention of the Indian to kill either of them can\r\nonly be conjectured. The circumstances were extremely suspicious. Major\r\nWashington hints at this incident in his journal.\r\n\r\nThe next night, at dusk, the travelers came to the Allegheny River, a\r\nlittle above Shannopino, where they expected to cross over on the ice.\r\nIn that they were disappointed, the river being frozen only a few yards\r\non each side, and a great body of broken ice driving rapidly down the\r\ncurrent.\r\n\r\nThere was no way of getting over the river but on a raft, which they set\r\nabout to build with the aid of but one poor hatchet. They worked hard\r\nall day and finished the raft just after sundown. They launched their\r\nraft, got aboard and pushed off. But before they got to midstream they\r\ngot caught in an ice jam. Washington set his pole in an effort to stop\r\nthe raft, but the current threw the raft against his pole with much\r\nviolence and he was hurled out into ten feet of water. He fortunately\r\nsaved himself by grabbing hold of a raft log, and was assisted aboard by\r\nhis companions, but in spite of all their efforts they could not get the\r\nraft to either shore, but were obliged to land on a small island and\r\nencamp for the night.\r\n\r\nMr. Gist’s hands and feet were frozen and their sufferings through the\r\nnight were extreme. The ice had formed during the night of sufficient\r\nthickness to bear their weight, and they crossed over without accident,\r\nand the same day traveled about ten miles, reaching a trading post\r\nestablished by John Frazier, at Turtle Creek, near the spot where\r\neighteen months afterward was fought the memorable battle of the\r\nMonongahela.\r\n\r\nAnxious to hasten back and report to Governor Dinwiddie the result of\r\nhis mission, Major Washington and Mr. Gist recrossed the Allegheny\r\nMountains to Gist’s house on Wills Creek and thence Washington proceeded\r\nwith dispatch to Williamsburg, where he arrived on January 16, 1754,\r\nhaving been absent eleven weeks.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                John Binns, English Political Prisoner,\r\n                  American Politician and Editor, Died\r\n                           November 16, 1860\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Binns was one of the most influential citizens of the State during\r\nthe quarter century of which the War of 1812 might be considered the\r\ncentral period. He was a politician, but more than all else an editor,\r\nwho was a fearless and trenchant writer.\r\n\r\nBinns had experienced a stormy life in England before he came to\r\nAmerica. He was born December 22, 1772, in the city of Dublin, Ireland,\r\nand received a fair education at an English school.\r\n\r\nApril, 1794, he went to London and soon became a member of the London\r\nCorresponding Society, an event which gave much color to his future\r\nlife. This society was the leading opposition to the Crown and many of\r\nits members were arrested and tried for high treason. Binns was an\r\nofficer and most active member, and was soon in trouble, being arrested,\r\nMarch 11, 1796, while making an address in Birmingham, and imprisoned in\r\n“The Dungeon,” charged with “delivering seditious and inflammatory\r\nlectures.”\r\n\r\nBinns was mixed up in the movement of the United Irishmen to have France\r\nmake an invasion of Ireland. He was arrested four times for the same\r\noffense, and was sentenced to Clerkwell Prison. Soon as he was\r\nliberated, he was again arrested for high treason, and sent to the Tower\r\nof London, where he was confined under a strict watch.\r\n\r\nAfter a number of trials he was freed, only to be again arrested, and\r\nconfined in Gloucester prison, where he was ill-treated. On his\r\nliberation he embarked, July 1, 1801, for the United States and landed\r\nin Baltimore September 1.\r\n\r\nUpon his arrival at Baltimore, he hired three wagons, loaded them with\r\nhis personal effects, and set out, on foot to accompany them to\r\nNorthumberland, where he proposed to reside. At Harrisburg he hired a\r\nboat, and helped push it up the Susquehanna. At Northumberland he joined\r\nDr. Joseph Priestley and Judge Thomas Cooper, two former Englishmen, who\r\nhad sought refuge there.\r\n\r\nDr. Priestley lived an ideal life of peace and usefulness in\r\nNorthumberland, but Dr. Cooper, the most learned man of his time, a\r\nJudge, president of two different colleges, and renowned chemist, was so\r\nviolent in his politics that he was imprisoned for a libel on President\r\nJohn Adams.\r\n\r\nOn July 4, 1802, John Binns delivered an oration, which was printed in\r\nthe Northumberland Gazette, the only paper published beyond Harrisburg,\r\nin the State, at that time. The many criticisms of this oration led to a\r\nlengthy newspaper controversy, and finally resulted in John Binns\r\nestablishing at Northumberland the Republican Argus, which soon became\r\none of the best and most widely known papers in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nJohn Binns, from that date and for many years thereafter, became a\r\ndominant factor in politics. About this time he fought a duel, near\r\nMilton, with a man from Williamsport, named Samuel Stewart, which was\r\none of the last duels fought on Pennsylvania soil.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1807, he was urged by the influential Democrats to remove\r\nfrom Northumberland to Philadelphia and to establish a newspaper there.\r\nThe Aurora had lost its punch; William J. Duane was losing his grip as a\r\nleader, and Binns’ power and influence were in the ascendent.\r\n\r\nBinns yielded to these solicitations and the first number of the\r\nDemocratic Press appeared in Philadelphia March 27, 1807. He was advised\r\nagainst using the world “Democratic” in his paper’s title, and later\r\ntook much satisfaction in having started the first paper anywhere\r\npublished under the name. He claimed the title of his paper led to the\r\nchange of the party name to “Democratic.”\r\n\r\nBinns was an ardent friend and admirer of Simon Snyder, then Speaker of\r\nthe House of Representatives. Governor McKean defeated Snyder, “the\r\nPennsylvania Dutchman,” but the latter was again returned to the House\r\nand elected Speaker.\r\n\r\nSnyder was again nominated in 1808. During this campaign Binns wrote a\r\nseries of letters, over the signature of “One of the People,” addressed\r\nto Governor McKean, which were published in all the Democratic\r\nnewspapers of the State, and also in pamphlets.\r\n\r\nBinns had no sooner arrived in Philadelphia than he had a clash with Dr.\r\nMichael Leib, who had been the autocratic political leader, but for some\r\nyears with lessening power.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic Press openly opposed Dr. Leib’s candidacy for re-election\r\nto the General Assembly, claiming the doctor was the cause of the\r\ndissensions among the Republican Party. Leib was elected, but by a much\r\nreduced majority than the other Republican candidate received, and Duane\r\nwas defeated for the Senate. The Aurora groaned aloud at this “first\r\nFederal triumph” since Jefferson’s election.\r\n\r\nFrom its first issue Binn’s paper was highly successful. It soon was\r\npublished daily. Its circulation increased rapidly and in the same\r\nproportion the Aurora began to lose subscribers.\r\n\r\nThe power of Binns was increased in the election of Simon Snyder as\r\nGovernor in 1808. Duane and Leib were, at heart, opposed to Snyder, but\r\ncould not stem the tide and supported him.\r\n\r\nDr. Leib was elected to the United States Senate in 1809, but Duane was\r\nnot pleased with Governor Snyder. The Press defended him. The Aurora\r\ncriticized his conduct and was soon in opposition in all that he did. By\r\nAugust the Aurora threatened the Governor with impeachment, and in\r\nOctober announced he should never again be Governor.\r\n\r\nBinns called the Aurora and its supporters “The Philadelphia Junto,” and\r\nthey soon joined with the Federalists. Binns already was in favor of a\r\nwar with England, and he was active in pledging support to the\r\nAdministration.\r\n\r\nIn 1811, Governor Snyder was overwhelmingly re-elected, and by 1812\r\nBinns was even stronger as a leader, possibly increased by his war\r\nenthusiasm. The Democratic Press published strong articles on the war,\r\nwhile the Aurora was silent.\r\n\r\nIn fall of 1813 the Democrats were successful, but in 1814, though\r\nSnyder was elected for a third term by 20,000 votes over Wayne, and the\r\nState Legislature was strongly Democratic, yet the Federalists were\r\nlargely successful in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nLeib was appointed postmaster at Philadelphia in February, 1814, but the\r\nopposition was too strong and he was removed, and passed off the\r\npolitical stage. Duane, who was supreme for a time, antagonized large\r\nnumbers of his party, and finally yielded to Binns, who completely took\r\nfrom him his power.\r\n\r\nBinns was an aid on the staff of Governor Snyder, with rank of\r\nLieutenant Colonel and was actively engaged during the War of 1812–14.\r\n\r\nGovernor Snyder always remained a close and intimate friend of Binns,\r\nand while he was in office, Binns exercised great power, but only\r\nmaintained his sway a few years after Snyder’s last term.\r\n\r\nBinns bitterly opposed Jackson for President. He issued the famous\r\ncoffin handbills in 1828, and excited thereby such opposition that his\r\nhouse was mobbed, Binns escaping by the roof.\r\n\r\nHe was appointed an alderman by Governor Hiester in 1822, and in 1829\r\nthe publication of the Democratic Press ceased.\r\n\r\nJohn Binns died November 16, 1860.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Administration of Sir William Keith as\r\n                        Deputy-Governor. He Died\r\n                           November 17, 1749\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the administration of Sir William Keith, Deputy-Governor of the\r\nProvince, July, 1718, to July, 1726, a difficulty arose between the\r\nSouthern Indians upon the Shenandoah, and those resident upon the\r\nSusquehanna in the Province of Pennsylvania, respecting the limits of\r\ntheir hunting grounds. Hostilities between them seemed imminent. It was\r\nnecessary to settle these difficulties amicably or the peace of the\r\nProvince was seriously threatened.\r\n\r\nTo avert this, says Proud, Governor Keith paid a visit to the Governor\r\nof Virginia, with whom he framed a convention, confining the Indians on\r\nthe North and South of the Potomac to their respective side of that\r\nriver. A conference was held with the Pennsylvania Indians and the Five\r\nNations, at Conestoga, July 6, 1721, when this convention was fully\r\nratified.\r\n\r\nGovernor Keith made this visit in state. He was attended by seventy\r\nhorsemen, many of them were armed. He was welcomed upon his return at\r\nthe upper ferry on the Schuylkill, by Mayor William Fishbourne and the\r\nAldermen of Philadelphia, accompanied by two hundred of the most\r\nrespectable citizens, who conducted him through the streets after the\r\nmanner of a hero returned from a conquest.\r\n\r\nTrouble over the boundary arose when the Governor of Maryland proposed\r\nmaking a survey on the Susquehanna, within the limits of the present\r\nYork County.\r\n\r\nGovernor Keith resolved to resist this attempt by force, and ordered out\r\na militia company from New Castle. The Provincial Council discouraged\r\nthis show of violence.\r\n\r\nThe Indians became alarmed at the encroachments of the Marylanders and\r\nconveyed to Governor Keith a large tract of land, that he might have a\r\nbetter title to resist them. This land was given for the use of\r\nSpringett Penn, the grandson of William Penn, and was afterwards known\r\nby the name of Springettsbury Manor.\r\n\r\nThe fears of the Province were soon after awakened by a quarrel between\r\ntwo brothers named Cartlidge and an Indian near Conestoga, in which the\r\nIndian was killed, with many evidences of cruelty. The known principles\r\nof revenge professed by the Indians gave reason to apprehend severe\r\nretaliation. Policy and justice required a rigid inquiry and punishment\r\nof the murderers.\r\n\r\nGovernor Keith took prompt measures for their apprehension and the\r\nAssembly ordered a coroner’s inquest, though the body had been buried\r\ntwo months, and the arrest of the Cartlidge brothers.\r\n\r\nMessengers were dispatched to the Five Nations to deprecate hostilities,\r\nand, to prevent further irregularities, the prohibition of sale of\r\nspirituous liquors to the Indians was re-enacted, with additional\r\npenalties.\r\n\r\nThe Indians invited Governor Keith and the governors of Virginia, New\r\nYork, and the New England colonies, to meet with them in council at\r\nAlbany, where with great magnanimity, the Indians pardoned the offense\r\nof the Cartlidges, and requested they might be discharged without\r\nfurther punishment. The address of the Indian sachem is worth repeating:\r\n\r\n“The great King of the Five Nations is sorry for the death of the Indian\r\nthat was killed, for he was of his own flesh and blood; he believes the\r\nGovernor is also sorry; but, now that it is done, there is no help for\r\nit, and he desires that Cartlidge may not be put to death, nor that he\r\nshould be spared for a time and afterwards executed; one life is enough\r\nto be lost; there should not two die. The King’s heart is good to the\r\nGovernor, and all the English.”\r\n\r\nGovernor Keith was attended on this journey to Albany by Messrs. Hill,\r\nNorris, and Hamilton, of his Council.\r\n\r\nA considerable part of the emigration to the colonies was composed of\r\nservants, who were of two classes. The first and the larger part, were\r\npoor and oppressed in the land of their nativity, sometimes the victims\r\nof political changes or religious intolerance, who submitted to\r\ntemporary servitude, as a price of freedom, plenty and peace. The\r\nsecond, vagrants and felons, the dregs of the British populace, who were\r\ncast by the mother country upon her colonies, with the most selfish\r\ndisregard of the feelings she outraged.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1682 the Council proposed to prohibit convicts from the\r\nprovince, but as none had entered and this was only prospective, no law\r\nwas enacted. Now the Council did enact such a law, by placing a duty of\r\nfive pounds upon every convicted felon brought into the Province, and\r\nthe importer was also required to give surety for the good behavior of\r\nthe convict for one year.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1722 there were commercial embarrassments caused by the\r\ndeficiency of the circulating medium. Governor Keith proposed to\r\novercome this difficulty by the introduction of paper money. The\r\nAssembly moved with caution, for they had full knowledge of the mistakes\r\nof the colonies, and issued only £15,000 on favorable terms to keep up\r\ntheir credit. This act was passed March 2, 1723. The emission proved of\r\nadvantage but was insufficient, so towards the end of the year £30,000\r\nmore were emitted on the same terms.\r\n\r\nGovernor Keith, in espousing this popular cause, pleased the Assembly\r\nbut incurred the displeasure of the Proprietary party and its leader,\r\nJames Logan. Complications arose which eventuated in the triumph of\r\nLogan and the deposition of Keith, who was decidedly the most successful\r\nof the Proprietary Governors.\r\n\r\nFranklin said of Keith, that “he differed from the great body of the\r\npeople whom he governed, in religion and manners, yet he acquired their\r\nesteem and confidence. If he sought popularity, he promoted the public\r\nhappiness; and his courage in resisting the demands of the family may be\r\nascribed to a higher motive than private interest. The conduct of the\r\nAssembly toward him was neither honorable nor polite; for his sins\r\nagainst his principles were virtues to the people, with whom he was\r\ndeservedly a favorite; and the House should have given him substantial\r\nmarks of their gratitude as would have tempted his successors to walk in\r\nhis steps. But fear of further offence to the Proprietary family, the\r\ninfluence of Logan, and a quarrel between the Governor and Lloyd, turned\r\ntheir attention from him to his successor.”\r\n\r\nAfter his removal, Sir William Keith resided in the Province, and was\r\nelected to the Assembly, but he manifested a most unjustifiable and\r\nmalicious spirit, and caused dissensions in the administration of his\r\nsuccessor. His power and influence rapidly waned.\r\n\r\nIn 1729 he returned to England, where, it is sad to record, he died in\r\nobscurity, in London, November 17, 1749.\r\n\r\n“It may be very little known,” says Watson, “that he who moved with so\r\nmuch excitement and as our Governor in 1726, should at last fall into\r\nsuch neglect, as to leave his widow among us unnoticed and almost\r\nforgotten! She lived and died in a small wooden house on Third Street,\r\nbetween High and Mulberry. There, much pinched for subsistence, she eked\r\nout her existence with an old female, declining all intercourse with\r\nsociety or with her neighbors. The house itself was burnt in 1786.”\r\n\r\nLady Ann Keith died July 31, 1740, aged 65 years, and lies entombed at\r\nChrist Church graveyard.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Governor Joseph Hiester, Distinguished\r\n                  Revolutionary Officer and Statesman,\r\n                         Born November 18, 1872\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the early settlement of that part of Pennsylvania which is now\r\nincluded within the limits of Berks County a large portion of the\r\npopulation was drawn from those parts of Germany bordering on or near\r\nthe River Rhine.\r\n\r\nAmong these sturdy emigrants were three brothers, John, Joseph and\r\nDaniel Hiester.\r\n\r\nJohn, the eldest, emigrated in 1732, and was followed in 1737 by Joseph\r\nand Daniel, who sailed in that year in the ship St. Andrew from\r\nRotterdam.\r\n\r\nThese three brothers were sons of John and Catherine Hiester and their\r\nbirthplace was the village of Elcoff in the county of Wittgenstein, in\r\nthe province of Westphalia, Prussia. The father, John Hiester, was born\r\nin January, 1708.\r\n\r\nThe three brothers first settled in Goshenhoppen, then Philadelphia, now\r\nMontgomery County. Soon after the arrival of Joseph and Daniel, they\r\npurchased of the Proprietary Government a tract of several thousand\r\nacres in Bern Township, now Berks County.\r\n\r\nHere John and Joseph settled, and the Hiester family in America are\r\ntheir descendants. Here was born a patriot of the Revolution,\r\ndistinguished citizen and statesman, who afterwards became a governor of\r\nthe Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nJoseph Hiester, son of John Hiester, was born in Bern Township, November\r\n18, 1752.\r\n\r\nHe spent his early days on the farm and in the intervals of the routine\r\nfrom labor, Joseph received the rudiments of an English and German\r\neducation under the supervision of the pastor of Bern Reformed Church.\r\n\r\nIn 1771, in his nineteenth year, he married Elizabeth Whitman, daughter\r\nof Adam Whitman, of Reading, to which place he soon removed, and went\r\ninto the mercantile business with his father-in-law.\r\n\r\nJoseph Hiester was an ardent Whig in politics and took an aggressive\r\npart in espousing the cause of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nAs a representative of that party he was chosen a member of the\r\nPennsylvania Conference, which met in Philadelphia, June 18, 1776, and\r\nwhich in reality assumed the government of the Province, called a\r\nconvention to frame a new constitution, gave instructions for the\r\nguidance of its representatives in Congress, and authorized the calling\r\nout of troops for the Continental Army. In all these proceedings he was\r\na warm supporter of the popular cause.\r\n\r\nHe was then a captain of militia, and no sooner had the conference\r\nadjourned, than he hastened home and aroused the young men of Reading\r\nand vicinity to the importance of enlisting in the cause of American\r\nindependence, at that time but feebly supported.\r\n\r\nJoseph Hiester called together, by beat of drum, his fellow-townsmen, to\r\ntake into consideration the alarming state and gloomy prospects of their\r\ncountry. He explained to them the perilous situation of General\r\nWashington in New Jersey, and urged them to enlist and march to his\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nHe was heard with attention and respect, and his proposition was kindly\r\nreceived. He then laid forty dollars on the drum-head and said: “I will\r\ngive this sum as a bounty, and the appointment of a sergeant to the\r\nfirst man who will subscribe to the articles of association to form a\r\nvolunteer company to march forthwith and join the Commander-in-Chief;\r\nand I will also pledge myself to furnish the company with blankets and\r\nnecessary funds for their equipment, and on the march!”\r\n\r\nThis promise he honorably and faithfully fulfilled.\r\n\r\nMatthias Babb stepped forward, signed the article, and took the money\r\nfrom the drumhead. His example, and the further advancement of smaller\r\nsums of money, induced twenty men that evening to subscribe to the\r\narticles of association. In ten days Captain Joseph Hiester had enrolled\r\na company of eighty men.\r\n\r\nThe company became a part of the Flying Camp, but soon Captain Hiester\r\nwas induced to extend his efforts, and a battalion was shortly obtained.\r\nHe could have been made their colonel but declined to be even a major,\r\nso attached was he to his original company.\r\n\r\nWhen his command reached Elizabethtown, N. J., it was learned General\r\nWashington had moved to Long Island. Captain Hiester used his best\r\nendeavor to induce the men to advance, as they had enlisted only for\r\nPennsylvania service, and following his patriotic lead, they marched to\r\njoin Washington.\r\n\r\nThe gallant captain little knew the hard fate that was to be his. In the\r\nbattle of Long Island he was taken prisoner, with most of his men, and\r\nconfined in the notorious prison-ship, Jersey, where they were subjected\r\nto every indignity which refined cruelty could invent.\r\n\r\nAfter seven months’ imprisonment Captain Hiester was exchanged, and\r\nreturned in time to take part in the battle of Germantown, where he\r\nreceived a wound in the head.\r\n\r\nIn the varied fortunes of the patriot army he continued to share until\r\nthe close of the war.\r\n\r\nHe was appointed by the Supreme Executive Council one of the\r\ncommissioners of exchange, April 5, 1779, and on October 21, following,\r\none of the committee to seize the personal effects of traitors.\r\n\r\nHe was chosen to the General Assembly in 1780, and served almost\r\ncontinuously from that date until 1790.\r\n\r\nHe was a delegate to the Pennsylvania convention to ratify the Federal\r\nConstitution in 1787, and in 1789, he was a member of the convention\r\nwhich framed the State Constitution of 1790. He was chosen a\r\npresidential elector in 1792, and again in 1796.\r\n\r\nHe served in the fifth to eighth Congress, and again in the fifteenth\r\nand sixteenth Congresses, and during his last term was elected Governor\r\nof Pennsylvania by the Federalists, defeating Governor William Findlay,\r\nin a campaign which for personal vituperation has never been equalled in\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\nGovernor Hiester’s administration was most successful, but he would not\r\nallow himself to be nominated for a second term.\r\n\r\nReturning to Reading, he retired to private life, and died there June\r\n10, 1832.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n           President Lincoln Delivered Address at Dedication\r\n                      of the National Cemetery at\r\n                     Gettysburg, November 19, 1863\r\n\r\n\r\nAbraham Lincoln made many notable speeches, the most prominent of which,\r\nprobably, were those delivered in his historic debates with Stephen A.\r\nDouglas, the “Little Giant.”\r\n\r\nOn his way from his home in Springfield to Washington for his\r\ninauguration he made a number of speeches, the most notable of which was\r\ndelivered in Philadelphia in Independence Hall. But the most famous of\r\nall his addresses as President was delivered November 19, 1863, at the\r\ndedication of the Soldiers’ National Cemetery on the battlefield of\r\nGettysburg.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln left Washington at noon on Wednesday, November 18,\r\n1863. There were four passenger coaches, in which were seated the\r\nPresident, members of his Cabinet, several foreign ministers, the\r\nprivate secretaries of the President, officers of the Army and Navy, a\r\nmilitary detail serving as a guard, and newspaper correspondents. This\r\nspecial train pulled into the town of Gettysburg about dark of that day.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln passed the evening and night in the home of David Wills, who\r\nwas the special representative of Governor Andrew G. Curtin and the most\r\nactive agent in the establishment of the Soldiers’ Cemetery.\r\n\r\nArnold, in his “History of Lincoln and the Overthrow of Slavery,”\r\nasserts that the President while on his way from the White House to the\r\nbattlefield was notified that he would be expected to make some remarks,\r\nand that asking for some paper a rough sheet of foolscap was handed to\r\nhim. Retiring to a seat by himself, with a pencil be wrote the address.\r\n\r\nMrs. Andrews in her beautiful story entitled “The Perfect Tribute” says,\r\n“The President appealed to Secretary Seward for the brown paper he had\r\njust removed from a package of books: ‘May I have this to do a little\r\nwriting?’ and then with a stump of a pencil labored for hours over his\r\nspeech.”\r\n\r\nContrary to those statements, General James B. Fry, who was present in\r\nthe car as one of the escort, says:\r\n\r\n“I have no recollection of seeing him writing or even reading his speech\r\nduring the journey; in fact, there was hardly any opportunity for him to\r\nread or write.”\r\n\r\nThat opinion is shared by no less an authority than Nicolay, the senior\r\nof the President’s private secretaries, who in an interesting and highly\r\nvaluable paper on the Gettysburg address, says:\r\n\r\n“There is neither record, evidence, nor well-founded tradition that Mr.\r\nLincoln did any writing or made any notes on the journey between\r\nWashington and Gettysburg. The many interruptions incident to the\r\njourney, together with the rocking and jolting of the train, made\r\nwriting virtually impossible.”\r\n\r\nMorory in his “History of the United States for Schools,” says: “There\r\nis conclusive evidence that the words of the address were not written\r\nout until after the presidential party had arrived on the ground”; and\r\nin an appendix it is stated:\r\n\r\n“The following account of how the address was written was received\r\ndirectly from the lips of ex-Governor Curtin, of Pennsylvania, who was\r\npresent on the occasion and knew whereof he affirmed. Governor Curtin\r\nsaid that after the arrival of the party from Washington, while the\r\nPresident and his Cabinet, Edward Everett, the orator of the day,\r\nGovernor Curtin, and others were sitting in the parlor of the hotel, the\r\nPresident remarked that he understood that the committee expected him to\r\nsay something. He would, therefore, if they would excuse him, retire to\r\nthe next room and see if he could write out something.”\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Edward McPherson, of Gettysburg, for many years Clerk of the\r\nHouse of Representatives and father of the present Judge Hon. Donald P.\r\nMcPherson, of Adams County, said in 1875, that after Lincoln had retired\r\nto his room on the night of the 18th he sent for his host and “inquired\r\nthe order of exercises for the next day and begun to put in writing what\r\nhe called some stray thoughts to utter on the morrow.” Mr. Wills always\r\nbelieved the address was written in his house and said in 1893, as he\r\nhad earlier, that the President read “from the same paper on which I had\r\nseen him writing it the night before.”\r\n\r\nNoah Brooks, a newspaper correspondent at Washington during the war, who\r\nwas on terms of friendly intimacy, declared that a few days prior to\r\nNovember 19, 1863, Lincoln told him that Mr. Everett had kindly sent him\r\na copy of his oration in order that the same ground might not be gone\r\nover by both. The President added, “There is no danger that I shall; my\r\nspeech is all blocked out—it is very short.”\r\n\r\nWard H. Lamon, a personal friend and chief marshal of the ceremonies at\r\nGettysburg, in his “Recollections of Abraham Lincoln,” states that Mr,\r\nLincoln read to him, a day or two before the dedication, what he claims\r\nto have been in substance, if not in exact words, what was afterward\r\nprinted in his famous Gettysburg speech.\r\n\r\nSenator Simon Cameron, also asserted, in a newspaper interview, that he\r\nhad seen a draft of the address in the White House before the President\r\nleft Washington.\r\n\r\nSuch are the divergent testimonies concerning the preparation of the\r\nAddress. Fortunately there exists documentary evidence to substantiate\r\nthe statements of Noah Brooks, Ward H. Lamon and Senator Cameron and to\r\nestablish conclusively that the address was the outcome of deliberation\r\nand careful thought.\r\n\r\nThat is further emphasized in the wording of the formal invitation to\r\nthe President, which was written on November 2, and specifically stated\r\nthat “it is the desire that you as Chief Executive of the Nation\r\nformally set apart these grounds to their sacred use by a few\r\nappropriate remarks.”\r\n\r\nThe address has been so long and so generously accepted as the highest\r\nexpression of American oratory, that it is difficult to realize that it\r\never had less appreciation than now. The testimonies of those who heard\r\nthe address delivered differ widely as to the reception given and as to\r\nthe impression it made.\r\n\r\nBates in his “History of the Battle of Gettysburg,” in 1875, says: “Its\r\ndelivery was more solemn and impressive than is possible to conceive\r\nfrom its perusal.”\r\n\r\nArnold says: “Before the last sentence was completed, a thrill of\r\nfeeling like an electric spark pervaded the crowd. As he closed, and the\r\ntears and sobs and cheers which expressed the emotions of the people\r\nsubsided, he turned to Everett and, grasping his hand, said, ‘I\r\ncongratulate you on your success.’ The orator gratefully replied, 'Ah!\r\nMr. President, how gladly would I exchange all my hundred pages to have\r\nbeen the author of your twenty lines’.” Major Nickerson, Robert Miller\r\nand many others commented on a similar vein.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the address, published November 20, 1863, in the Public\r\nLedger, the North American, the Press, and the Bulletin, of\r\nPhiladelphia, were furnished by the Associated Press, the text is\r\nidentical in each. But many variations of this address are to be found\r\neven today.\r\n\r\nNot until the war itself had ended and the great leader had fallen did\r\nthe Nation realize that this speech had given to Gettysburg another\r\nclaim to immortality and to American eloquence its highest glory.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 The Seneca Chief Hiokatoo, “Most Cruel\r\n                      Human Being,” Died November\r\n                                20, 1811\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second husband of Mary Jemison, the celebrated Indian captive known\r\nas “The White Woman of the Genesee” was Chief Hiokatoo, who she\r\ndescribes as the most cruel human being of whom we have any authentic\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\nWhen Mary Jemison was an old woman she related the thrilling narrative\r\nof her long life among the Indians. Nothing told by the venerable\r\ncaptive was more thrilling than the life of Hiokatoo, also known as\r\nGardow.\r\n\r\nShe says: “He was an old man when I first saw him, but he was by no\r\nmeans enervated. During the nearly fifty years that I lived with him, I\r\nreceived, according to Indian customs, all the kindness and attention\r\nthat was my due as his wife. Although war was his trade from youth till\r\nold age and decrepitude stopped his career, he uniformly treated me with\r\ntenderness, and never offered an insult.\r\n\r\n“I have frequently heard him repeat the history of his life from his\r\nchildhood; and when he came to that part which related to his actions,\r\nhis bravery and his valor in war; when he spoke of the ambush, the\r\ncombat, the spoiling of his enemies and the sacrifice of the victims,\r\nhis nerves seemed strung with youthful ardor. The warmth of the able\r\nwarrior seemed to animate his frame and to produce the heated gestures\r\nhe had practiced in middle age. He was a man of tender feelings to his\r\nfriends, ready and willing to assist them in distress. Yet, as a\r\nwarrior, his cruelties to his enemies perhaps were unparalleled, and\r\nwill not admit of a word of palliation.\r\n\r\n“Hiokatoo was born in one of the tribes of the Six Nations that\r\ninhabited the banks of the West Branch of the Susquehanna, in\r\nPennsylvania. He belonged to a tribe of the Seneca nation. He was a\r\ncousin to Farmer’s Brother, a chief who has been justly celebrated for\r\nhis worth. Their mothers were sisters, and it was through the influence\r\nof Farmer’s Brother that I became the wife of Hiokatoo.\r\n\r\n“In early life Hiokatoo showed signs of thirst for blood by attending\r\nonly to the art of war, in the use of the tomahawk and scalping knife\r\nand in practicing cruelties upon everything that chanced to fall into\r\nhis hands which was susceptible of pain. In that way he learned to use\r\nhis implements of war effectually and at the same time blunted all those\r\nfine feelings and tender sympathies that are naturally excited by seeing\r\nor hearing a fellow being in distress.\r\n\r\n“He could inflict the most excruciating tortures upon his enemies and\r\nprided himself upon his fortitude in having performed the most barbarous\r\nceremonies and tortures without the least degree of pity or remorse.\r\nThus qualified, when very young he was initiated into scenes of carnage\r\nby being engaged in the wars that prevailed among the Indian tribes.”\r\n\r\nIn 1731 he was appointed a runner and assisted in collecting an army to\r\ngo against the Catawba, Cherokee and other Southern Indians. In one\r\ngreat battle of this war the Northern Indians ambushed their enemies and\r\nin two days massacred 1200 of their Southern enemies.\r\n\r\nDuring the French and Indian War Hiokatoo was in every battle that was\r\nfought along the Susquehanna and Ohio Rivers. At Braddock’s defeat he\r\ntook two white prisoners and burned them alive in a fire of his own\r\nkindling.\r\n\r\nMary Jemison says he participated in the battle at Fort Freeland, on\r\nWarrior Run, Northumberland County, July 28, 1779. She says:\r\n\r\n“Hiokatoo was in command of the 300 Seneca Indians, and that Captain\r\nJohn MacDonald commanded more than one hundred British regulars.\r\nHiokatoo, with the help of a few Indians, tomahawked every wounded\r\nAmerican while earnestly begging with uplifted hands for quarter.”\r\n\r\nIn an expedition against Cherry Valley, N. Y., Hiokatoo was second in\r\ncommand. This force of hundreds of Indians was determined upon the total\r\ndestruction of the whites.\r\n\r\nBesides these instances, he was in a number of parties during the\r\nRevolution, where he ever acted a conspicuous part.\r\n\r\nWhen Tory Colonel John Butler and Chief Joe Brant were making their\r\nterrible incursions against the settlers in lower New York and\r\nPennsylvania they frequently resided with Chief Hiokatoo and his wife,\r\nMary Jemison, at their home in the German Flats.\r\n\r\nDuring General Sullivan’s expedition against the Indians in the summer\r\nof 1779, Hiokatoo was most active in his attempt to frustrate his plans.\r\nDuring this march Lieutenant Thomas Boyd was captured by the Indians in\r\nambush. While Chief Little Beard was in command at Boyd’s cruel\r\nexecution, Hiokatoo was a close second.\r\n\r\nHiokatoo was one of the leading actors in the diabolical scene following\r\nthe capture of Colonel William Crawford, July, 1782, when he was put to\r\ndeath after the most inhuman barbarities were inflicted upon him.\r\n\r\nThe cruel Indian chief was assisted in these fiendish scenes by Simon\r\nGirty, the white savage renegade and outlaw Tory. Hiokatoo was the\r\nleading chief in the battle which destroyed Colonel Crawford’s command\r\nand personally directed the colonel’s execution. He painted Dr. Knight’s\r\nface black with his own hands and had him conducted to the place where\r\nhe was to be executed. Dr. Knight escaped during the night and was able\r\nto reach his home and give the horrid details of Crawford’s execution.\r\n\r\nChief Hiokatoo served in seventeen campaigns during the period of the\r\nRevolution, until his death, which occurred on November 20, 1811, at the\r\nadvanced age of 103 years.\r\n\r\nHiokatoo was about six feet four inches tall, large boned and rather\r\ninclined to leanness. He was very powerful and active for a man of his\r\nunusual size, and his wife said of him that he never found an Indian who\r\ncould keep up with him in a race or throw him wrestling.\r\n\r\nHis eye was quick and penetrating and his voice was so harsh and\r\npowerful that amongst the Indians it always commanded attention. His\r\nhealth was uniformly good, and he was never confined by illness until\r\nattacked with tuberculosis when quite 100 years of age.\r\n\r\nDuring his married life as the husband of the White Woman of the Genesee\r\nhe was the father of four daughters and two sons. The elder of the two\r\nsons, John, killed his half-brother, Thomas, in a family feud which had\r\nexisted between them since John was born, although Thomas was a fine\r\ncharacter and John dissolute.\r\n\r\nJohn a few years later, May, 1812, killed his own brother, Jesse, in a\r\ndrunken frenzy, inflicting no less than eighteen wounds with a knife,\r\neach so deep that it would have been fatal. Jesse was twenty-seven years\r\nold and had been more like his mother than the other children. He\r\nshunned the Indian frolics, dressed and acted more like a white man and\r\nwas sober and industrious.\r\n\r\nThus we see the cruelty of old Chief Hiokatoo inherited by his own son\r\nand inflicted upon his own blood in a most fiendish manner.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Delegates to the Constitutional Convention\r\n                        Chosen November 21, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nOn November 5, 1788, General Thomas Mifflin succeeded Dr. Benjamin\r\nFranklin as president of the Supreme Executive Council. Dr. Franklin was\r\nnow eighty-two years old and desired to be relieved of so exacting a\r\nresponsibility and declined the re-election, which was assured him. At\r\nthe same time George Ross, of Lancaster, was elected vice president.\r\n\r\nThe first election for electors of President and Vice President of the\r\nUnited States, under the new Constitution was held January 7, 1789. The\r\nFederal ticket was successful. The ten votes of Pennsylvania were given\r\nto General George Washington as President, and eight votes for John\r\nAdams, and two for John Hancock, for Vice President.\r\n\r\nThe National Government, feeble at first, had no buildings and no home.\r\nDuring seven years of Washington’s term as President the capital was at\r\nPhiladelphia. Congress met at Sixth and Chestnut Streets. The Supreme\r\nCourt met at Fifth and Chestnut Streets. The President lived on Market\r\nStreet below Sixth Street. The Government of the United States has never\r\npaid the rent for these public buildings and in its infancy and\r\nweakness, Pennsylvania gave our National Government a home without\r\ncompensation therefor.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of Pennsylvania as adopted in 1776, had long since\r\nproved inadequate for the requirements of a useful and effective\r\ngovernment, and its revision was demanded. The Assembly, March 24, 1789,\r\nadopted resolutions recommending the election of delegates to form a new\r\nConstitution. The Supreme Executive Council refused to promulgate this\r\naction of the Assembly. In September following the Assembly adopted\r\nresolutions for calling a convention.\r\n\r\nAt the election in October delegates were chosen and on November 21,\r\n1789, the convention assembled in Philadelphia, and organized with the\r\nelection of General Thomas Mifflin, Chief Executive of the State, as\r\nPresident of the convention. The sessions of the convention were long\r\nand tedious, and an adjournment was had for a time in 1790, but their\r\nlabors were concluded, and the new Constitution adopted September 2,\r\n1790.\r\n\r\nThe most radical changes were made in the executive and legislative\r\nbranches of the Government. The Assembly ceased to have the sole right\r\nto make laws, a Senate being created. The Supreme Executive Council was\r\nabolished. A Governor was directed to be elected, to whom the\r\nadministration of affairs was to be intrusted.\r\n\r\nThe former judicial system was continued, excepting that the Judges of\r\nthe higher courts were to be appointed during good behavior instead of\r\nfor seven years. The Bill of Rights re-enacted the old provincial\r\nprovision copied into the first Constitution respecting freedom of\r\nworship, rights of conscience and exemptions from compulsory\r\ncontribution for the support of any ministry.\r\n\r\nThe recognition of God and of a future state of rewards and punishments\r\nwas still demanded of all holding office, but a belief in the divine\r\ninspiration of the Old and New Testaments was not included. The Council\r\nof Censors ceased to have authority, and Pennsylvania conformed in all\r\nimportant matters to the system upon which the new Federal Government\r\nwas to be administered.\r\n\r\nThe first election held in Pennsylvania under the new Constitution of\r\nthe Commonwealth—that of 1790—resulted in the election of General Thomas\r\nMifflin, then president of the Supreme Executive Council, who had\r\npresided at the forming of the new instrument. Mifflin had little or no\r\nopposition. His election was evident from the start, for there were no\r\nreal issues. The result turned chiefly on his better-known personal\r\nqualities. Parties had not yet become crystallized with definite issues.\r\n\r\nGeneral Arthur St. Clair, his opponent, was highly esteemed as a citizen\r\nand brilliant soldier, but the popularity of Mifflin carried him in\r\ntriumph, and for three terms he was chosen to the chief magistracy of\r\nPennsylvania. His success was his own; he builded his own house.\r\n\r\nGovernor Mifflin’s chief political adviser was Alexander J. Dallas, who\r\nwas appointed to the office of Secretary of the Commonwealth. That was a\r\nwise selection. Dallas was young, but brilliant and deeply interested in\r\npolitics. He knew the leading men of the State and maintained a close\r\nrelationship with them.\r\n\r\nWith the new Constitution functioning, the course of legislation turned\r\nin various channels. The promotion of internal improvements which have\r\nsince become so important in Pennsylvania, and other enterprises of a\r\nless public character, soon demanded the attention of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\nOne of the first measures was that urged by the Society for the\r\nImprovement of Roads and Canals, and which contemplated the construction\r\nof highways and artificial waterways at the expense of the State. This\r\nsuggestion aroused such a storm of opposition that the Legislature was\r\ncompelled to reject the original proposition and to pass bills providing\r\nonly partial and doubtful encouragement for their establishment by\r\nprivate enterprise.\r\n\r\nA long and valuable report was made February 19, 1791, which embodied\r\nthe results of examinations made previously. The committee reported that\r\nthe Delaware River could be made an important channel for the trade of\r\nNew York by the construction of a portage canal of nineteen miles; that\r\na safe boat and raft navigation might be made to the northern boundary\r\nof the State for £25,000. They gave an estimate of the grain which was\r\nbrought down the Susquehanna and the Juniata and they reported on the\r\nprobable trade along the Allegheny River and how it could be increased\r\nby canals at certain places.\r\n\r\nThey recommended that the Governor should issue a proclamation inviting\r\nproposals for building canals and locks in and near the waters of the\r\nTulpehocken and Quittapahilla; for a canal from Frankstown to Poplar\r\nRun, and for clearing the Susquehanna from Wright’s Ferry to Havre de\r\nGrace. They also wanted proposals for a turnpike from Philadelphia\r\nthrough Lancaster to the Susquehanna and for other roads throughout the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nA bill was passed April 6, 1792, and in August Governor Mifflin apprised\r\nthe Legislature that he had made contracts for the improvements of\r\ncertain streams, but that “several propositions had not yet met with\r\npersons willing to undertake the specified work.”\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1793 the Bank of Pennsylvania was incorporated by the\r\nLegislature, the opinion being expressed that it would “promote the\r\nregular, permanent and successful operations of the finances of the\r\nState and be productive of great benefit to trade and industry in\r\ngeneral.”\r\n\r\nThe State subscribed for one-third of the entire stock and branches were\r\nestablished at Lancaster, Harrisburg, Reading, Easton and Pittsburgh.\r\nThese were discontinued in 1810; in 1843 the State sold its stock, and\r\nwith the great financial crisis of 1857 the Bank of Pennsylvania sank in\r\nruin.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Joe Disberry, Remarkable Thief, First\r\n                       Arrested November 22, 1783\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the close of the Revolutionary War a notorious character named\r\nDisberry lived between Selinsgrove and Sunbury. He was possessed of\r\ngreat physical strength and had few superiors in running, jumping and\r\nskating. But in thieving and lying he was considered a match for the\r\nprince of darkness himself.\r\n\r\nSo bold was he that, according to reminiscences preserved by early\r\nsettlers, he was known to enter the kitchen of a dwelling when the\r\nfamily were in bed, start up a fire, cook a meal and eat at his leisure.\r\nIf disturbed in this agreeable occupation he relied on his swiftness of\r\nfoot to escape.\r\n\r\nAt length Joe became so notorious on account of his thieving\r\npropensities that the whole settlement was up in arms against him, and\r\nhe was finally arrested November 22, 1783, and imprisoned in the jail at\r\nSunbury. But as the jail—which was the first one built in Northumberland\r\nCounty—was not secure he quickly escaped, and Sheriff Antes offered a\r\nreward for his apprehension.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion Disberry took refuge on the “Isle of Que” and\r\nconcealed himself in a thicket of bushes, where he fancied himself\r\nsecure. He might have remained undiscovered and escaped but for his\r\ninordinate love of perpetrating jokes.\r\n\r\nLying on the watch near the road cut through the thicket Joe heard the\r\nfootsteps of a horse and, slyly peeping from his covert, espied the\r\nSheriff’s wife approaching on horseback. He at once stepped into the\r\nroad and, pulling off his hat, made a polite bow, when he suddenly\r\ndisappeared in the bushes. The lady hurried to Selinsgrove and gave the\r\nalarm.\r\n\r\nA party headed by George Kremer was immediately formed and went to the\r\nisland in pursuit of Joe. Guided by the lady’s instructions, Kremer went\r\nto the spot and soon had the culprit in custody. He was taken back to\r\njail, tried and sentenced, and his sentence is one of the strangest\r\nfound in the annals of criminal history of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nIn the Quarter Sessions docket of Northumberland County the record shows\r\nthat Joe Disberry was arraigned on the charge of felony, tried and found\r\nguilty. The jury was composed as follows: Peter Hosterman, Adam Grove,\r\nGeorge Shaffer, Philip Frick, John Harrison, Michael Grove, William\r\nClark, Adam Christ, Robert Irwin, Paul Baldy, John Shaffer, Alexander\r\nMcGrady. The sentence of the Court, which still stands out boldly on the\r\nrecord, was as follows:\r\n\r\n“Judgment that the said Joseph Disberry receive thirty-nine lashes\r\nbetween the hours of 8 and 9 o’clock tomorrow; to stand in the pillory\r\none hour; to have his ears cut off and nailed to the post; to return the\r\nproperty stolen or the value thereof; remain in prison three months; pay\r\na fine of £30 to the honorable the president of this State for the\r\nsupport of the Government, and stand convicted until fine, fees, etc.,\r\nare paid.”\r\n\r\nThis remarkable sentence shows the estimate that was put on Joe as a\r\ncriminal. The whipping post and pillory stood in the public square in\r\nSunbury.\r\n\r\nColonel John Henry Antes was the Sheriff at that time and directed the\r\nwhipping, if he did not do it himself.\r\n\r\nThere is no record to show who did the ear chopping, but as the surgical\r\noperation fell to the Sheriff also, it is probable that he did it.\r\n\r\nJohn Buyers was the president of the court at that time, assisted by\r\nassociates, and the duty of imposing the sentence fell on him. The Court\r\nmet, according to the entry in the docket on the fourth Tuesday of\r\nAugust, 1784, and as the trial took place at once, the sentence was\r\ncarried out on Wednesday.\r\n\r\nAmong the jurors were several men who were prominent as Indian fighters\r\nand participants in the war for liberty.\r\n\r\nPeter Hosterman, foreman, was active as a militia officer and had\r\ncommand of a body of militia to watch and repel savage attacks.\r\n\r\nAdam and Michael Grove were famous as Indian scouts, and the latter only\r\na short time before he served on this jury, was one of a company that\r\npursued a party of marauding Indians up the Sinnemahoning. Discovering\r\ntheir camp they stealthily approached at night, rushed upon them,\r\nsurprised them, captured their arms and killed several. The balance\r\nescaped. The Grove brothers then lived in Buffalo Valley, now Union\r\nCounty.\r\n\r\nThis severe sentence, it seems, did not cure Joe Disberry of his\r\nthieving propensities, for the Quarter Sessions docket for August term,\r\n1798 (Northumberland County), shows that he was arraigned and tried on\r\nthree indictments for burglarizing the houses of Philip Bower, Peter\r\nJones and Isaiah Willits, and convicted on each.\r\n\r\nThe jurors who found him guilty on each count were John Clark, John\r\nMetzgar, John Friesbach, George Clark, John Armstrong, John Cochran,\r\nThomas Murray, Christian Gettig, John Dewart, George Bright, Peter\r\nDisher and Hamelius Lomison.\r\n\r\nJudge Jacob Rush was President Judge assisted by Captain William Wilson,\r\nJohn McPherson, Thomas Strawbridge and Colonel William Cooke as\r\nassociates. Robert Irwin was high sheriff of the county. Judge Rush, on\r\nsentencing Disberry, said:\r\n\r\n“That the prisoner, Joseph Disberry, forfeit all and singular his goods\r\nand chattels, lands and tenements, to and for the use of the\r\nCommonwealth, and undergo a servitude of seven years for the burglary\r\ncommitted in the house of Peter Bower, and be committed to the house of\r\ncorrection, pay the cost of prosecution, &c.”\r\n\r\nThe Court then sentenced him on the two other indictments, seven years\r\neach. Joe, who was listening very attentively remarked rather jocosely:\r\n“Why, Your Honor, three sevens make twenty-one!”\r\n\r\nJudge Rush then continued: “That the defendant be conveyed to the gaol\r\nand penitentiary house of the city of Philadelphia to undergo the\r\nservitude aforesaid for the term of twenty-one years. And that the said\r\nJoe Disberry be kept for the space of two years in solitary cells out of\r\nthe term of twenty-one years.”\r\n\r\nThis remarkable criminal served his long sentence and returned in 1819\r\nto his old haunts, about Sunbury and the Selinsgrove, an aged man, but\r\nas merry as a cricket. Being a natural-born thief, he could not resist\r\nthe temptation to steal everything upon which he could lay his hands.\r\n\r\nThe date of his death is unknown. But the late Dr. Robert Harris Awl, of\r\nSunbury, said that some time after his return from serving his long\r\nsentence, he went one night to a mill in Union County to steal flour and\r\nfalling through a hatchway sustained injuries which resulted in his\r\ndeath. It is said that when they came to bury him, the owner of the mill\r\ninsisted that he should be buried deep. “For,” said he, “if it is not\r\ndone he will return and steal mill, dam and all!”\r\n\r\nIt is not positively known whence this remarkable man came. Tradition\r\nsays that he was a native of Connecticut. In that event he might have\r\nbeen among the emigrants to Wyoming, but on account of his evil\r\npropensities was banished to Sunbury as a punishment to Dr. Plunket and\r\nhis people, for whom the Wyomingites bore no love. Neither is it known\r\nwhether he had any family or property. His criminal record, however,\r\nwould furnish material enough for a first-class romance.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Border Invasion by Thomas Cresap Ceased\r\n                  After His Arrest, November 23, 1736\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was great conflict between the several Lords Baltimore,\r\nProprietaries of Maryland, and the Penns, Proprietaries of Pennsylvania,\r\nover the boundary of their respective provinces, which lasted from the\r\ntime William Penn first received his grant until the Mason and Dixon\r\nboundary line was surveyed in 1763–67.\r\n\r\nConestoga Township, in what is now Lancaster County, was originally\r\norganized about 1712. Prior to 1719 it was divided into East and West\r\nConestoga. The western boundaries of the latter were not defined until\r\n1722, when Donegal Township was erected and Chicques Creek was made its\r\neastern boundary. Pequea Township seems to have been to the northeast of\r\nConestoga, with not very well defined boundaries, and was probably\r\nerected about the year 1720.\r\n\r\nLord Baltimore selected a pliant and bold adventurer for his agent in\r\nthis disputed territory named Thomas Cresap, aged twenty-six years, a\r\ncarpenter by occupation, and in religious faith a Roman Catholic, same\r\nas the Calverts of Maryland. He was to go to Conejohela Valley and\r\nsettle, where he built a cabin and established a ferry, on March 16,\r\n1730, near James Patterson’s land.\r\n\r\nIn a joint statement made by James Patterson to Justices John Wright and\r\nSamuel Blunston they issued a warrant and wrote to Governor Patrick\r\nGordon, October 30, 1732, and said:\r\n\r\n“About two years Since, Thomas Cresap, and some other people of Loose\r\nMorals and Turbulent Spirits, Came and disturbed the Indians, our\r\nfriends and Allies, who were peaceably Settled on those lands from when\r\nthe said Parnel and others had been removed, Burnt their Cabbins, and\r\ndestroyed their goods, And with much threatening and Ill-usage, drove\r\nthem away, and by pretending to be under the Maryland government, sought\r\nto Evade ours. Thus they proceeded to play booty. Disturbing the Peace\r\nof the Government, Carrying people out of the Province by Violence,\r\nTaking away the guns from our friends, the Indians, Tying and making\r\nthem Prisoners without any offence given; and threatening all who should\r\nOppose them; And by Underhand and Unfair practices, Endeavoring to\r\nAlienate the minds of the Inhabitants of this Province, and Draw them\r\nfrom Obedience to their party. Their Insolence Increasing, they killed\r\nthe horses of Such of our people whose trade with the Indians made it\r\nNecessary to Keep them on that Side of the river, for Carrying their\r\nGoods and Skins; assaulted those who were sent to look after them.”\r\n\r\nCresap’s house was a convenient refuge for runaway servants and debtors.\r\nSamuel Chance, a runaway debtor of Edward Cartlidge, an Indian trader\r\nwho lived in the Manor, took up his abode with Cresap and assisted him\r\nto row his ferryboat. A son of Cartlidge laid a plan to capture Chance\r\nby decoying him to the east side of the river.\r\n\r\nCresap and Chance got into their boat and rowed over to the Blue Rock,\r\nwhere they found Edward Beddock, Rice Morgan, and a Negro servant of Mr.\r\nCartlidge. After being taken into the boat, and rowed out into the\r\nstream a few yards, Beddock and Morgan threw Cresap into the river, and\r\ntook Chance to shore with them. Cresap made his escape to an island\r\nnearby, where he remained until after dark, when he was discovered by an\r\nIndian and rescued.\r\n\r\nCresap made complaint to the Maryland authorities, and a sharp\r\ncorrespondence between the Governors of the two Provinces resulted.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1733, Cresap came up to Wright’s Ferry and commenced to\r\nbuild boats and erect a house. Wright and Blunston had placed a number\r\nof men in the ferryhouse, who sallied forth and took Cresap’s men\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\nJohn Emerson, a lawyer, who lived in Lancaster, was appointed ranger and\r\nkeeper of the Conestoga Manor. He also owned a ferry at Blue Rock. On\r\nJanuary 29, 1734, accompanied by Knowles Daunt and five others, Emerson\r\nwent down to Cresap’s house to arrest him. Cresap shot Daunt in the leg,\r\nfrom the effects of which he died. They failed to capture Cresap and he\r\nafterward made frequent raids into Kreitz Valley with bands of armed\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1735, when John Wright was harvesting his grain, Cresap\r\nappeared with twenty men, women and lads, armed with guns, swords,\r\npistols, blunderbusses and drums beating.\r\n\r\nWright approached Cresap and demanded the reason of their military\r\ndisplay. Cresap replied that they came to fight the Pennsylvanians, drew\r\nhis sword and aimed his pistol at Wright’s breast, who, by his courage,\r\ncompletely cowed Cresap and captured his wagons. Wright and his men then\r\nmade a fort of the ferryhouse on the west side of the river.\r\n\r\nCresap reported these doings to Governor Ogle, who ordered out the\r\nMaryland militia. Wright learned of this martial movement and engaged\r\nBenjamin Chambers to ascertain their designs. Chambers was suspected as\r\na spy and arrested, but escaped to Wright’s Ferry and made a full\r\nreport. He then went to Donegal and collected a number of Scotch-Irish,\r\nand marched them to Wright’s Ferry, where they repelled two or three\r\nhundred Marylanders, under Colonel Hall.\r\n\r\nCresap built a fort from which bands of armed men went out to raid\r\nplantations, destroy houses and take the settlers prisoners to Maryland.\r\nJoshua Minshal and John Wright, Jr., were the only two men left in\r\nKreitz’s Valley.\r\n\r\nCresap had surveyed forty tracts of land, which were owned by Germans.\r\nThis state of affairs became so critical that Provincial Council\r\nconcluded to have Cresap arrested for the murder of Knowles Daunt.\r\n\r\nOn November 23, 1736, a warrant was placed in the hands of Sheriff\r\nSamuel Smith, who lived at Donegal. He called upon John Kelley, Benjamin\r\nSterratt, Arthur Buchanan, Samuel Scott, David Priest, John Sterratt,\r\nJohn Galbraith, James, John and Alexander Mitchell, James Allison and\r\nnineteen others to assist him.\r\n\r\nOn the night of November 24, 1736, they surrounded Cresap’s house, in\r\nwhich he had a number of armed men, who fired upon Sheriff Smith and his\r\nparty. Laughlin Malone, of Cresap’s party, was killed, and John Copper,\r\nof the Sheriff’s party, was wounded.\r\n\r\nFinding that Cresap would not surrender, the Sheriff set his house on\r\nfire, when Cresap attempted to escape, but was overpowered and carried\r\nin triumph to Philadelphia and placed in prison.\r\n\r\nColonel Hall and Captain Higgenbotham came to Cresap’s fort with 300\r\nmen, and at different times marched through the valley in martial array.\r\nIn January, 1737, a company attacked these Marylanders in Cresap’s fort,\r\nbut were repulsed with the loss of eight men.\r\n\r\nThe Governor of Maryland offered £100 reward for the arrest of John\r\nWright, Samuel Blunston, Sheriff Samuel Smith, John Ross, Michael\r\nTanner, Joshua Minshal and Charles Jones. The last three persons were\r\narrested and taken to Annapolis jail.\r\n\r\nThe Marylanders were finally driven back to their State, and all efforts\r\nto colonize that part of Pennsylvania with Marylanders was abandoned in\r\n1738, and the Cresap invasions into Pennsylvania ceased.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Moravians Slaughtered in Indian Village of\r\n                    Gnadenhutten, November 24, 1755\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first settlement in what is now Carbon County was made by the\r\nMoravian missionaries in the year 1746.\r\n\r\nThe converted Mohican Indians having been driven out of Shekomeko, N.\r\nY., near the border of Connecticut, and from Pochgatgach, in the latter\r\nState, found an asylum for a short time at Friedenshutten, near\r\nBethlehem.\r\n\r\nThe missionaries considered it unwise to maintain a large Indian\r\ncongregation so near Bethlehem, and they purchased two hundred acres on\r\nthe north side of Mahoning Creek, about a half mile above its junction\r\nwith the Lehigh. Here the Indian town of Gnadenhutten became a regular\r\nfixture, and in it each Indian family possessed its own lot of ground.\r\n\r\nThe paths to Wyoming and other Indian towns passed through the\r\nsettlement. A church stood in the valley, the Indian houses formed a\r\ncrescent upon the higher ground, and on the open end stood the home of\r\nthe missionary and the burying ground.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1749, Baron John de Watteville, a noted bishop of the\r\nMoravian Brethren, went to Gnadenhutten and laid the foundation of a new\r\nchurch, replacing the one built in 1746, which was too small for the\r\ngrowing congregation, which then consisted of 500 Indians.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Reverend David Brainerd and several Indian converts\r\nvisited Gnadenhutten. The congregation continued in this pleasing and\r\nregular state until 1754.\r\n\r\nThe Delaware and Shawnee on the Susquehanna began to waver in their\r\nallegiance to the English. They were preparing to take up the hatchet on\r\nthe side of the French, and it became a matter of concern to them to\r\nwithdraw their Indian brethren in the Moravian settlements beyond the\r\nreach of the whites, that the hostile savages might more freely descend\r\nupon the white settlements.\r\n\r\nThe Christian Indians for some time resolutely refused to move to\r\nWyoming or Shamokin. At length, however, a considerable part of them\r\nwere seduced by the influence of the Delaware King Tedyuskung to move.\r\n\r\nThe Mohicans who remained were joined by other Christian Delaware and\r\nsoon the land upon which they lived became so impoverished that the\r\ninhabitants of Gnadenhutten removed to the north side of the Lehigh\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\nThe dwellings were removed and a new chapel built in June, 1754. This\r\nplace was called New Gnadenhutten, and stood where the borough of\r\nWeissport now stands.\r\n\r\nIn New Gnadenhutten the Mohican lived on one side of the street, the\r\nDelaware on the opposite side. The cultivation was under the direct\r\ncharge of the Moravian missionaries.\r\n\r\nThe Indians who had gone over to the French interests became incensed\r\nthat any of the Moravian converts among their people should choose to\r\nremain at Gnadenhutten, and they determined to cut off the settlement.\r\n\r\nAfter Braddock’s defeat, July, 1755, the whole frontier was open to the\r\ninroads of the savage foe. Every day disclosed new scenes of barbarity\r\ncommitted by the Indians. The whole country was in terror; the neighbors\r\nof the brethren in Gnadenhutten forsook their dwellings and fled, but\r\nthe brethren covenanted together to remain undaunted in the place they\r\nbelieved Providence had allotted them.\r\n\r\nIn that decision they neglected no caution whatever. But it was not to\r\nbe as the Moravians had planned.\r\n\r\nLate in the evening of November 24, 1755, the mission house on the\r\nMahoning was attacked by the French Indians, the house burned to the\r\nground and eleven of the inhabitants murdered.\r\n\r\nThe attack was made while the family was at supper. The uncommon barking\r\nof the dogs was noticed, upon which Brother Senseman went out to the\r\nback door to ascertain what was the matter. The report of a gun was\r\nheard, when several of the family rushed to the open door, where they\r\nwere confronted with the Indians who stood with their firearms pointed\r\ntoward the door, who simultaneously fired upon the Moravians.\r\n\r\nMartin Nitschmann was instantly killed, his wife and several others were\r\nwounded, but were able to flee with the rest of the household upstairs\r\ninto the garret, where they barricaded the door with bedsteads. Brother\r\nPartsch escaped by jumping out of a rear window. Brother Worbass, who\r\nwas ill in bed in an adjoining house, also escaped by a window, although\r\nthe savages had placed a guard before his door.\r\n\r\nThe savages pursued those who had taken refuge in the garret and finding\r\nthe door too strongly secured, they set fire to the house. A lad, named\r\nSturgis, jumped from the blazing roof and escaped, but not before he was\r\nseverely burned by the flames and shot in the face in making his escape.\r\n\r\nSoon as Sturgis was seen to get away, Sister Partsch took courage and\r\njumped from the burning roof, and escaped unhurt. Brother Fabricius\r\nattempted to flee in the same manner, but was observed by the Indians\r\nand twice wounded and captured. He was immediately tomahawked and\r\nscalped. The rest of the household were all burnt alive.\r\n\r\nBrother Senseman witnessed his wife being consumed by the flames. The\r\nscene was terrible to behold.\r\n\r\nSoon as the house was destroyed the savages set fire to the barns and\r\nstables, by which all the corn, hay and cattle were destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe Indians then divided the spoils, soaked some bread in milk, made a\r\nhearty meal, and departed—all this being observed by Sister Partsch\r\nlooking on from her hiding place behind a tree upon a hill near the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nThis melancholy event proved to be the delivery of the Indian converts\r\nat Gnadenhutten; for upon the first crack of the guns and seeing the\r\nflames, they sensed the cause and would have rushed to the defense of\r\nthe Moravians had not a missionary advised them to the contrary. Instead\r\nthey all fled to the woods, and in a few minutes, Gnadenhutten was\r\ncleared of everything worth while.\r\n\r\nReverend David Zeisberger, who had just arrived at Gnadenhutten from\r\nBethlehem, hastened back to give notice of this terrible event to a body\r\nof English militia which had marched within five miles of the spot, but\r\nthey did not venture to pursue the savages in the dark.\r\n\r\nThe fugitive congregation arrived safely at Bethlehem. After the French\r\nand Indians had retired, the remains of those killed on the Mahoning\r\nwere carefully collected from the ruins and solemnly interred.\r\n\r\nA broad slab of marble placed there in 1788, now marks the grave, which\r\nis situated on the hill a short distance from Lehighton, and a little\r\nnorth of a small hamlet which occupies the site of the ancient\r\nmissionary village. The following is the inscription on the marble:\r\n\r\n“To the memory of Gottleib and Joanna Anders, with their child,\r\nChristiana; Martin and Susanna Nitschmann, Anna Catherine Senseman, John\r\nGattenmeyer, George Fabricius, clerk; George Schweigert and Martin\r\nPresser, who lived here at Gnadenhutten unto the Lord, and lost their\r\nlives in a surprise from Indian warriors, November the 24th, 1755.\r\n\r\n“Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints—Psalms\r\ncxvi, 15.”\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               General Forbes Invested Fort Duquesne and\r\n                     Named It Pittsburgh, November\r\n                                25, 1758\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the humiliating defeat of Major Grant, September 14, 1758, when he\r\ndisobeyed his orders and attacked the French and Indians at Fort\r\nDuquesne and was himself taken prisoner, the French, exulting over their\r\nunlooked-for victory, believed that a successful attack could now be\r\nmade upon the main army of General John Forbes in camp at Loyalhanna. By\r\nthis bold stroke, in which they would use their entire force, they\r\ncould, in the discomfiture of the English, end all hostilities, as they\r\nhad done in the fateful defeat of Braddock.\r\n\r\nGeneral Forbes was wiser than his predecessor, and better appreciated\r\nthe talents and experience of Colonel George Washington, and did not\r\nfail to seek his counsel.\r\n\r\nGeneral Forbes had joined Colonel Henry Bouquet at Loyalhanna and\r\ndetermined to advance upon Fort Duquesne. Washington drew up the plan,\r\nillustrating the proper disposition of the troops in the line of march,\r\nso the English would not again be overwhelmed by a surprise attack.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the forces of the French and their Indian allies rushed\r\nthrough the woods toward Loyalhanna, dragging some light cannon with\r\nthem. They reached their objective before the British army had moved. An\r\nattack was made and long sustained, but the English, under General\r\nForbes, repulsed the French, who returned to Fort Duquesne.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Loyalhanna has never been given its proper place in\r\nhistory for it was a noteworthy affair, important in its consequences.\r\n\r\nThe French had beaten Braddock by the aid of their Indian allies, and\r\nthey hoped to defeat Forbes in the same way, but Colonel Bouquet had\r\nadopted the provincial practice of fighting Indians, which was the means\r\nof bringing them to a realization of their inability to conquer the\r\nEnglish, and they abandoned hopes of success and quit the French.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the French garrison in Fort Duquesne in September, 1758,\r\nwas 4000 troops, but by October this number was reduced to less than\r\n2000, including the Indians. On September 22, Christian Frederic Post,\r\nthe noted Moravian missionary and friend of the English, who had visited\r\nthe garrison, reported its strength as 1400, but added he believed\r\n“there would be full 3000 French and Indians, almost all Canadians, who\r\nwould be ready to meet the army under Forbes.”\r\n\r\nThe militia of Louisiana and Illinois left the fort early in November\r\nand went home. The Indians of Detroit and the Wabash country would\r\nremain no longer, and, what was even worse, the supplies destined for\r\nPort Duquesne had been destroyed by Bradstreet at Fort Frontenac. Hence\r\nM. de Ligneris, the commandant, was compelled by prospective starvation\r\nto dismiss the greater part of his force, and await the approach of the\r\nEnglish with those that remained.\r\n\r\nThe French had always depended on the aid of the Indians to hold this\r\nfort. But it was the custom of the Indians after a battle, whether\r\nsuccessful or not, to go home.\r\n\r\nColonel James Smith, at that time a prisoner who had been adopted into\r\none of the tribes, in his very valuable narrative, says that after the\r\ndefeat of Major Grant the Indians held a council, in which their\r\nopinions were divided. Some believed General Forbes would now turn back\r\nand go home the way he came, as Dunbar had done after the Braddock\r\ndefeat; others supposed he would press forward and make the attack. The\r\nFrench urged the Indians to remain, but many returned to their squaws,\r\nchildren and hunting.\r\n\r\nThese things were unknown to the English. But when the actual condition\r\nof affairs in Fort Duquesne reached General Forbes, he concluded, late\r\nas it was, to advance.\r\n\r\nOn November 13 Colonel John Armstrong with one thousand men was sent\r\nforward to assist Colonel Washington in opening the road, and four days\r\nlater General Forbes pressed forward. He met with no opposition, but the\r\nextremely disagreeable weather impeded his progress. The wagons and all\r\nthe artillery, except a few light pieces, were left behind.\r\n\r\nThe force consisted of 2500 picked men, who marched without shelter or\r\nbaggage and burdened only with knapsack and blankets. There were in\r\naddition the pioneers, wagoners and provincials engaged to work on the\r\nroads. Friendly Indians were kept out as scouts, and the greatest\r\nvigilance was exercised to avoid surprise. Washington and Armstrong\r\nopened the way to within a day’s march of the fort.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of November 24, the army encamped among the hills of\r\nTurtle Creek. That night they were informed by an Indian scout that he\r\nhad discovered a cloud of smoke above the fort and soon after another\r\nscout came with the certain intelligence that the fort was burned and\r\nabandoned by the enemy. A troop of horse was sent forward immediately to\r\nextinguish the fire. At midnight the men on guard heard a dull and heavy\r\nbooming over the western woods.\r\n\r\nIn the morning the march was resumed, the strong advance guard leading\r\nthe column. Forbes came next, carried in his litter, as he was quite\r\nill. The troops followed in three parallel columns, the Highlanders,\r\nunder Montgomery, in the center, the Royal Americans on the right and\r\nthe provincials on the left under Colonels Bouquet and Washington. It\r\nwas dusk when they emerged upon the open plain and saw Fort Duquesne\r\nbefore them, with the background of wintry hills beyond the Monongahela\r\nand Allegheny.\r\n\r\nWhen the fort was invested on November 25 it presented a sorry\r\nappearance. It had consisted of two fortifications, about 200 yards\r\napart. One, built with immense labor, was small but strong; the other\r\nstood on the bank of the Allegheny, in form of a parallelogram, but\r\nweaker than the other. There were about thirty chimneys standing, the\r\nhouses being destroyed by fire.\r\n\r\nThe French had also blown up one of the magazines, but in the other was\r\nfound sixteen barrels of ammunition, a large quantity of iron, gun\r\nbarrels, guns and a cartload of scalping knives. It has never been made\r\nknown if they buried their cannon in the river or carried them away in\r\ntheir hasty retreat.\r\n\r\nA boy twelve years old who had been an Indian prisoner two years escaped\r\nduring the retreat and told General Forbes that the French had carried a\r\nlarge quantity of wood into the fort and that they burned five of the\r\nprisoners they took at Major Grant’s defeat on the parade and delivered\r\nthe others to the Indians, who tomahawked the men on the spot.\r\n\r\nThere were many dead bodies found within a short distance of the fort,\r\nand many evidences of French inhumanity.\r\n\r\nThe Indians remaining about the fort were only too eager to treat with\r\nGeneral Forbes.\r\n\r\nBancroft says: “Armstrong’s own hand raised the British flag on the\r\nruined bastions of the fortress. As the banner of England floated over\r\nthe waters the place, at the suggestion of Forbes, was with one voice\r\ncalled Pittsburgh.”\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Captain James Smith, of the “Black Boys,”\r\n                    Born in Chester County, November\r\n                                26, 1737\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the first captives of the French and Indian War in 1755 was James\r\nSmith, of the Conococheague frontier, in what is now Franklin County.\r\n\r\nHe survived a long captivity and afterward wrote a remarkable account of\r\nhis experiences which were published in Archibald Loudon’s “Indian\r\nNarratives.”\r\n\r\nHe was born in Chester County November 26, 1737, and spent his early\r\nyouth in that neighborhood. In 1755 he was living along the frontier in\r\nthe vicinity of McDowell’s Mill, in present Franklin County, where he\r\nwas employed by his brother William, who was a commissioner to build a\r\nroad from the above mill to the Three Forks of the Youghiogheny, over\r\nwhich it was intended to transport supplies for General Braddock.\r\n\r\nWhen the builders reached the base of the Alleghenies a storehouse for\r\nsupplies was placed in charge of Robert McCoy. The supply of meat was\r\nalmost exhausted and McCoy dispatched young Smith to meet the wagons,\r\nbringing a fresh supply, and hurry along the cattle and provisions.\r\n\r\nBefore reaching the Juniata Smith met Arnold Vigorus, who advised him\r\nthat the wagons were near at hand. Smith then started back with Vigorus,\r\nbut when the wagons arrived at McCoy’s the wagoners reported they had\r\nseen nothing of Smith or his companion.\r\n\r\nMcCoy sent out a searching party, who soon found the boy’s hat and\r\nVigorus’s gun, and a short distance away his scalped body.\r\n\r\nJames Smith was a captive for five years and experienced a most varied\r\nand severe ordeal.\r\n\r\nHe effected his escape and returned to the Conococheague in 1760. As his\r\nfamily and friends believed him dead, their surprise over his return was\r\nthe greater and even his gait and manners of the Indians did not lessen\r\ntheir joy in his return.\r\n\r\nSmith learned that the sweetheart of his boyhood, believing him long\r\nsince dead, had married only three days before his return, when his\r\nthought was to claim her.\r\n\r\nSmith had no sooner returned to his home than he organized a company of\r\nIndian fighters, who wore Indian clothes, and were trained to Indian\r\nmethods. This company soon became known as the “Black Boys,” because\r\nthey painted their faces in the Indian colors—red and black. Smith was\r\nthe captain.\r\n\r\nDuring the Pontiac War these “Black Boys” were put under regular pay,\r\nand two other Indian captives served as Captain Smith’s lieutenants.\r\nThis company rendered effective service in the Cumberland Valley.\r\n\r\nAs Smith had served with Colonel John Armstrong and Colonel Henry\r\nBouquet, he had become familiar with the attitude of the Provincial\r\nauthorities in their treatment of the Indians.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that one day he overheard an interview in the Great Cove\r\nwhich revealed the arrogance of the traders and the unfairness of those\r\nat the seat of government. He took matters in his own hands, and\r\ndetermined food, clothing and other goods should not be sent to the\r\nWestern Indians if he could prevent it.\r\n\r\nCaptain Smith assembled ten of his command. They painted their faces in\r\nthe Indian fashion and waylaid a pack train at Sideling Hill, an episode\r\nin frontier history which has been misunderstood and misrepresented in\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nThe engagement was brief and decisive. The horses fell one after the\r\nother until the drivers were compelled to surrender.\r\n\r\nThe goods were assembled on one side, and the drivers led off some\r\ndistance, under guard. The “Black Boys” examined the contents of the\r\npacks, and, as they suspected, found them to consist of blankets,\r\nshirts, vermilion, lead, beads, wampum, tomahawks, scalping-knifes, etc.\r\nThe whole lot was burned.\r\n\r\nThe English soldiers thought the “Black Boys” were rioters, but the\r\ninhabitants viewed their acts with general satisfaction.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Grant attempted to effect the arrest of Captain Smith and his\r\ncommand, but the latter soon raised a force of 300 frontiersmen and\r\npromptly captured two British soldiers of the garrison at Fort Loudoun\r\nfor every one of the “Black Boys” they held as prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe result of this action was that very few pack trains passed through\r\nthat valley carrying goods to the Indians along the Ohio.\r\n\r\nIn 1769, when the Indians became troublesome in the vicinity of Fort\r\nBedford, a new company of “Black Boys” was organized, but members were\r\narrested and confined in irons, as they were not understood.\r\n\r\nCaptain Smith determined to release the men, and by a ruse managed to\r\napprize the British of his approach and intended attack, which was to\r\noccur at midday. But at dawn his command was under the bank of the\r\nJuniata awaiting word from William Thompson who had entered the fort as\r\na spy.\r\n\r\nAt the given signal the little band rushed the fort and secured the arms\r\nwhich were stocked in the center of the parade.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners were released and the first British fort in America was\r\nthen and there captured by what they termed “American rebels.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Smith was afterward arrested in Bedford and confined in jail, on\r\na trumped up charge of murder.\r\n\r\nHis “Black Boys” would have rescued him but Smith was conscious of his\r\ninnocence and stood trial. In spite of the fact they desired it\r\notherwise he was acquitted.\r\n\r\nSmith afterwards became a valued officer in the Revolution, attaining\r\nthe rank of colonel, and was several terms in the General Assembly and a\r\nmost distinguished citizen.\r\n\r\nAfter the Revolution Colonel Smith removed to Kentucky where he again\r\nearned an enviable reputation as an able member of the Legislature of\r\nthat State.\r\n\r\nHe died there in 1812.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             Pioneer Postoffice of Pennsylvania Established\r\n                       in Philadelphia, November\r\n\r\n27, 1700\r\n\r\n\r\nIn July, 1683, a post was established from Philadelphia to Maryland by\r\nWilliam Penn. Henry Waldy, of Tacony, had authority to run the post and\r\nsupply the passengers with horses.\r\n\r\nThe rates of postage were: Letters from the Falls to Philadelphia, three\r\npence; to Chester, five pence; to New Castle, seven pence; to Maryland,\r\nnine pence; from Philadelphia to Chester, two pence; to New Castle, four\r\npence; to Maryland, six pence. It went once a week, notice having been\r\nplaced on the meeting-house door and at other public places.\r\nCommunication was frequent with Manhattan and New York, the road\r\nstarting on the eastern side of the Delaware at about Bordentown, New\r\nJersey.\r\n\r\nBut the pioneer postoffice in the Province of Pennsylvania was\r\nestablished in Philadelphia under an act of Assembly, November 27, 1700.\r\n\r\nThe act by which this postoffice was established recited that “Whereas,\r\nThe King and the late Queen Mary, by their royal letters patent under\r\nthe great seal of England, bearing date the seventeenth day of February,\r\nwhich was in the year one thousand and six hundred and ninety-one, did\r\ngrant Thomas Neal, Esquire, his executors, administrators and assigns,\r\nfull power and authority to erect, settle, establish within the King’s\r\ncolonies and plantations in America, one or more office or offices for\r\nreceiving and dispatching of letters and packets by post, and to\r\nreceive, send and deliver the same, under such rates and sums of money,\r\nas shall be agreeable to the rates established by act of Parliament in\r\nEngland, or as the planters and others should agree to give on the first\r\nsettlement, to have, hold and enjoy the same for a term of twenty-one\r\nyears, with and under such powers, limitations and conditions as in and\r\nby the said letters patent may more fully appear.\r\n\r\n“And whereas, The King’s Postmaster General of England, and at the\r\nrequest, desire and nomination of the said Thomas Neale, hath deputed\r\nAndrew Hamilton, Esquire, for such time and under such conditions as is\r\nhis deputation is for that purpose mentioned to govern and manage the\r\nsaid General Post Office for and throughout all the King’s plantations\r\nand colonies in the mainland or continent of America and the islands\r\nadjacent thereto, and in and by the said deputation may more fully\r\nappear.\r\n\r\n“And whereas, The said Andrew Hamilton hath, by and with the good liking\r\nand approbation of the Post Master General of England made application\r\nto the proprietary and Governor of this Province and Territories and\r\nfreemen thereof convened in General Assembly, that they would ascertain\r\nand establish such rates and sums of money upon letters and packets\r\ngoing by post as may be an effectual encouragement for carrying on and\r\nmaintaining a general post, and the proprietary and Governor and Freemen\r\nin General Assembly met, considering that maintaining of mutual and\r\nspeedy correspondencies is very beneficial to the King and his subjects,\r\nand a great encouragement to trade, and that the same is best carried on\r\nand managed by public post, as well as for the preventing of\r\ninconveniences which heretofore have happened for want thereof, as for a\r\ncertain, safe and speedy dispatch, carrying and recarrying of all\r\nletters and packets of letters by post to and from all parts and places\r\nwithin the continent of America and several parts of Europe, and that\r\nthe well ordering thereof is matter of general concernment and of great\r\nadvantage, and being willing to encourage such a public benefit.\r\n\r\n“Section 1. Have therefore enacted and be it enacted, etc. That there be\r\nfrom henceforth one general letter office erected and established within\r\nthe town of Philadelphia, from whence all letters and packets whatsoever\r\nmay be with speed and expedition sent into any part of the neighboring\r\nColonies and plantations on the mainland and continent of America, or\r\ninto any other of the King’s kingdoms or dominions, or unto any kingdom\r\nor country beyond the seas; at which said office all returns and answers\r\nmay likewise be received, etc.”\r\n\r\nThus Governor Andrew Hamilton, of New Jersey, first devised the\r\npostoffice scheme for America, for which he obtained a patent, and the\r\nprofits accruing. He afterwards sold it to the Crown.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly appropriated £20 yearly as a salary to Andrew Hamilton,\r\n“the postmaster of North America under the Crown.”\r\n\r\nThus was the postal system established, and the postmaster empowered to\r\ndeliver mail to every corner of the Western World.\r\n\r\nThe first list of letters advertised appeared in the Pennsylvania\r\nGazette, March 21, 1738. It contained about 150 names of all the letters\r\ncollected and uncalled for in the previous six months, mostly for\r\nnon-residents.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1762, the following advertisement appeared in Bradford’s\r\nJournal:\r\n\r\n“The lad who was lately employed at the Postoffice as penny post having\r\nrun away, the gentlemen who expect letters are requested to call for\r\nthem until a suitable person can be procured to carry them. William\r\nDunlap.”\r\n\r\nIn November, 1756, the first stage was established between New York and\r\nPhiladelphia by John Butler. The Philadelphia terminal was at the sign\r\nof the Death of the Fox in Strawberry Alley. It was to go via Trenton\r\nand Perth Amboy, and to arrive in New York in three days. Butler was\r\nstarted in business by the old Hunting Club, to which he had been\r\nhuntsman and keeper of the kennels.\r\n\r\nIn 1765 a line of stage vessels and wagons was established between\r\nPhiladelphia and Baltimore, via Christiana and Frenchtown on the Elk\r\nRiver. These trips were made weekly.\r\n\r\nIn 1773, Messrs. C. Bessonett & Co., of Bristol, started a stage coach\r\nline which made the trip to New York in two days and charged $4 fare.\r\n\r\nThe old Postoffice was afterwards the Congress Hall Hotel. It was kept\r\nby Robert Patton, postmaster from 1791 to 1814.\r\n\r\nThe first postmaster of Philadelphia who received a newspaper notice as\r\nsuch was Peter Baynton in the Pennsylvania Gazette, of November 27,\r\n1776.\r\n\r\nWhen the Government was removed from New York to Philadelphia in 1791\r\nthe departments were located in private homes, and the “General\r\nPostoffice was on the east side of Water Street, a few doors below High\r\nStreet.”\r\n\r\nAn early pioneer mail route through the wilderness, across the State was\r\nover the old State road. It was established in 1805. The mail was\r\ncarried on horseback from Bellefonte to Meadville. The first contractor\r\nwas James Randolph, of Meadville, the second was Hamilton, of\r\nBellefonte.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Conway Cabal Started in Reading by General\r\n                      Mifflin on November 28, 1777\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the British marched triumphantly into Philadelphia there was gloom\r\nover America such as to make people lose all confidence in General\r\nWashington, the commander-in-chief, and as General Gates had but\r\nrecently, on October 19, 1777, achieved such a brilliant victory over\r\nBurgoyne at Saratoga, the one event to bring joy to their hearts, it was\r\nbut natural to suggest that Gates was the more competent. Many letters\r\nappeared in the public press favoring a change of commanders and\r\nPennsylvanians were clamorous for the retaking of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nGeneral Conway had written, “Heaven has been determined to save—your\r\ncountry or a weak general and bad counselors would have ruined it.” The\r\nwords reached Washington’s ears, and he let Conway know the fact. A\r\npersonal interview ensued, but Conway refused to apologize, and he\r\nboastfully told General Mifflin of his interview with the\r\ncommander-in-chief. He was commended by Gates, Mifflin and others.\r\n\r\nThe Gates faction in Congress procured Conway’s appointment as inspector\r\ngeneral of the Army and made him independent of the chief.\r\n\r\nGeneral Thomas Mifflin at this time was head of the Board of War, but on\r\nNovember 27 Gates became its president and the following day Mifflin\r\ndeclared to Gates that Conway’s letter was a “collection of just\r\nsentiments.” This produced what has been known in history as the “Conway\r\nCabal.”\r\n\r\nThe principal events which led up to this cabal transpired in Reading,\r\nwhich during the British occupation of Philadelphia became a favorite\r\nplace of resort for Philadelphians who wished to retire a little from\r\nthe stormy political atmosphere of the city.\r\n\r\nMore than a score of fugitive families made their homes there, among\r\nthem being General Thomas Mifflin, who at that moment was out of command\r\nin the army, complaining, though not ill, considerably restive, and\r\napparently not in high favor at headquarters. He was resting at his\r\ncountry estate, “Angelica,” three miles distant from Reading.\r\n\r\nThere were other officers of the Continental Army there and many gay\r\nsocial gatherings were held.\r\n\r\nIt was in these dissipations that gossip among the high officers\r\nfrequently turned against General Washington, who, according to Mifflin,\r\nwould only counsel with General Greene.\r\n\r\nThey said Greene was not the wisest, the bravest, nor the most patriotic\r\nof counselors.\r\n\r\nIn short, they averred that the campaign in this quarter was stigmatized\r\nas a series of blunders, and those who conducted it were incapable.\r\n\r\nThe better fortune of the northern army was ascribed to the superior\r\ntalents of its leader; and it began to be whispered that General Gates\r\nwas the man who of right should have the station sustained by\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nA cabal was soon formed, in which Gates, Mifflin and Conway were already\r\nengaged, and in which the congenial spirit of General Charles Lee, on\r\nhis exchange as a prisoner of war, immediately took a share.\r\n\r\nThe well-known apostrophe of General Conway to America, imparting that\r\n“Heaven had passed a decree in her favor, or her ruin must long before\r\nhave ensued from the imbecility of her military counsels,” was at this\r\ntime familiar wherever officers congregated.\r\n\r\nOn a visit which Conway made to Reading he expressed himself to the\r\neffect that “no man was more a gentleman than General Washington, or\r\nappeared to more advantage at his table, or in the usual intercourse of\r\nlife, but as to his talents for the command of an army, they were\r\nmiserable, indeed.”\r\n\r\nThese and similar expressions repeated frequently could not fail to\r\ncreate an unfavorable sentiment against the commander-in-chief.\r\n\r\nIt is also fortunate that the general population did not yet believe any\r\nof the officers busy in the cabal against Washington to be superior to\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nWithout the knowledge of Washington, the Board of War devised a winter\r\ncampaign against Canada, and gave the command to Lafayette. It was a\r\ntrick of Gates to detach the marquis from Washington. It failed.\r\n\r\nLafayette was summoned to York to receive his commission from Congress,\r\nthen in session there. That distinguished patriot met Gates, Mifflin and\r\nothers at table. The wine flowed freely and toasts abounded.\r\n\r\nAt length the marquis, thinking it time to show his colors, said:\r\n“Gentlemen, I perceive one toast has been omitted, which I will now\r\npropose.” They filled their glasses, when he gave praise to “the\r\ncommander-in-chief of the American armies.”\r\n\r\nThe coldness with which that toast was received confirmed Lafayette’s\r\nworst opinion respecting the men around him, and he was disgusted.\r\n\r\nThe conspirators, finding they could not use the marquis, abandoned the\r\nexpedition. So, also, was the conspiracy abandoned soon afterward.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the duel which subsequently took place between\r\nGeneral Conway and General Cadwalader, though immediately proceeding\r\nfrom an unfavorable opinion expressed by the latter of the conduct of\r\nthe former at the Battle of Germantown, had, perhaps, deeper origin, and\r\nsome reference to this intrigue, for the brave and competent\r\nPhiladelphian was an ardent champion of General Washington.\r\n\r\nSome of Gates’ New England friends became tired of him. Conway, found\r\nout, was despised, left the army and returned to France.\r\n\r\nSo the cabal resulted happily, in a thorough vindication of the wisdom\r\nof Washington, and brought deserved censure on those who had not done\r\ntheir full duty.\r\n\r\nBancroft says “that those who had caviled at Washington, being unable to\r\nshake the confidence of the people, wished their words benevolently\r\ninterpreted or forgotten, and Gates and Mifflin asked to be excused from\r\nserving on the committee,” meaning the committee which had been\r\nappointed by Congress to consult with Washington upon a complete reform\r\nin his administration of the army.\r\n\r\nMifflin became a major general in the following February and General\r\nGreene was made quartermaster general a few days later. Mifflin made a\r\nrequest to join the army in the field, but Congress desired Washington\r\nto make an inquiry into his conduct, which Washington did not do, and\r\nMifflin then tendered his resignation, which Congress refused to accept,\r\nand, although Mifflin’s health was miserable, he served throughout the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nThe internment of the army at Valley Forge called forth remonstrances of\r\nthe Continental Congress, the Supreme Executive Council and the Assembly\r\nof Pennsylvania and furnished much of the subject-matter by which\r\nWashington was censured by those who were partisans of other generals\r\nwho coveted the high and important office. These discouragements weighed\r\nheavily upon the anxious commander, who had quite enough trouble without\r\nthose in authority adding thereto.\r\n\r\nThe men in camp erected huts of logs and mud, but blankets and clothing\r\nwere scantily provided. Yet amid all this suffering, day after day,\r\nsurrounded by the frosts and snows of a severe winter, patriotism was\r\nstill warm and hopeful in the hearts of the soldiers. It has often been\r\nrecorded that Washington considered his experiences at Valley Forge as\r\nthe most trying scenes of his life.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Federal Party Is Broken Up in Closing Days\r\n\r\nof November, 1823\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was during the administration of Governor John Andrew Shulze, of\r\nLebanon County, that in 1823, President Monroe made his celebrated\r\ndeclaration in favor of the cause of liberty in the Western Hemisphere\r\nand the noninterference of European Powers in the political affairs of\r\nthis continent.\r\n\r\nThe determined stand taken by President Monroe was warmly indorsed by\r\nthe people of Pennsylvania, and the Legislature of the State at the\r\nsubsequent session adopted resolutions to the effect that it afforded\r\nthem “the highest gratification to observe the President of the United\r\nStates, expressing the sentiments of millions of freemen, proclaiming to\r\nthe world that any attempt on the part of the allied sovereigns of\r\nEurope to extend their political systems to any portion of the continent\r\nof America, or in any other manner to interfere in their internal\r\nconcerns, would be considered as dangerous to the peace and safety of\r\nthe United States.”\r\n\r\nGovernor Shulze, in transmitting the resolutions to the President,\r\nexpressed his hearty indorsement of the doctrines therein set forth.\r\n\r\nSoon after the election of Shulze, in the closing days of November,\r\n1823, the old parties were broken up, none after that calling themselves\r\nFederalists. Indeed, the term Federalist became odious; but from the\r\nashes there sprang a party that became more powerful than any which\r\nbefore or since has borne sway in this country, the great Democratic\r\nParty.\r\n\r\nEvery Federal newspaper in Pennsylvania except three—the United States\r\nGazette, of Philadelphia; The Village Record, of West Chester, and the\r\nPittsburgh Gazette—joined in its support.\r\n\r\nIn the national election of 1824, parties being in a disorganized state,\r\nthere was no choice for President by the people. Crawford, Adams, Clay,\r\nCalhoun and Jackson were supported. John Quincy Adams was elected to the\r\nHouse of Representatives. But in 1828 Jackson was chosen, receiving a\r\nmajority of 50,000 in Pennsylvania. His brilliant victory at New\r\nOrleans, gained with scarcely a casualty on our side, created immense\r\nenthusiasm among the people in his favor.\r\n\r\nIn 1824 and 1825 the Nation’s early friend and benefactor, General\r\nLafayette, revisited the scenes of his former trials and final triumphs.\r\nGovernor Shulze had the satisfaction of welcoming the hero to the soil\r\nof Pennsylvania, which he did at Morrisville in a brief but eloquent and\r\nimpressive speech.\r\n\r\nThis was Lafayette’s second visit to Pennsylvania and was an event which\r\nproduced marked and spontaneous enthusiasm among the entire population.\r\nNext to the great Washington he was hailed as the deliverer of this\r\ncountry, and nowhere was he made more welcome than in Philadelphia,\r\nHarrisburg and other parts of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThis was the era when stupendous plans for the internal improvement of\r\nthe Commonwealth were adopted and put into execution. The Schuylkill\r\nnavigation canal, which had been projected almost thirty years\r\npreviously, although not commenced until 1815, was completed in 1825.\r\nThe occasion was one of great rejoicing and the success of the\r\nenterprise gave an impetus to other improvements.\r\n\r\nShortly afterward the Union Canal was also finished, and the great\r\nPennsylvania Canal was prosecuted with vigor. Governor Schulze hesitated\r\nsomewhat at this stupendous plan of internal improvements by the State\r\nand opposed the loan of $1,000,000 authorized by the Legislature. He was\r\nobliged to yield, however, to the popular will, and before the close of\r\nhis second term $6,000,000 had been borrowed.\r\n\r\nAt the session of the General Assembly in 1826 a Board of Commissioners\r\nfor internal improvements was established. The Legislature authorized\r\nthe Commissioners to contract for a canal from Middletown extending up\r\nthe Susquehanna River as far as the mouth of the Juniata, and from\r\nPittsburgh to the mouth of the Kiskiminitas, a navigable feeder of a\r\ncanal from French Creek to the summit level of Conneaut Lake, and to\r\nsurvey a canal from there to Erie. These enterprises were started with\r\nthe modest appropriation of $300,000, which was to be borrowed.\r\n\r\nThe board made two contracts, one for twenty-two and one-half miles\r\nalong the Susquehanna and twenty-four miles along the Allegheny. At the\r\nfollowing session the canals authorized were to be extended farther up\r\nthe Susquehanna, the Juniata, and up the valley of the Kiskiminetas and\r\nthe Conemaugh, another between Bristol and Easton and others of lesser\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nIn 1826 Governor Shulze was renominated and received within 1000 of all\r\nthe votes cast for Governor. This was the nearest to a unanimous\r\nelection ever known in Pennsylvania, and was an evidence of the\r\nconfidence the people had in him, his fine character and intelligence.\r\n\r\nPrevious to 1827 the only railroads in America were a short wooden\r\nrailroad constructed at Leiper’s stone quarry, in Delaware County, Pa.,\r\nand a road three miles in length opened at the Quincy granite quarries\r\nin Massachusetts in 1826.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1827, a railroad nine miles in length was constructed from Mauch\r\nChunk to the coal mines. This was, at the time, the longest and most\r\nimportant railroad in America.\r\n\r\nIn 1828 the State determined to engage in railroad building. The canal\r\nextending through the center of the State was to be connected by a\r\nrailroad crossing the Allegheny Mountains, and with Philadelphia by a\r\nrailroad extending to Columbia. Thus by railroad and canal a system of\r\nhighway improved communication would extend from the Delaware to the\r\nOhio.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures were now so rapid and enormous that the State began to\r\nsuffer. Governor Shulze convened the Assembly in November, 1828, a month\r\nbefore retiring from office, and explained the tense situation. Funds\r\nhad given out, the work was stopped and something must be done. But as\r\nhe was soon to retire, he smoothed over the situation, leaving his\r\nsuccessor to wrestle with the problem.\r\n\r\nOn December 15, 1829, George Wolf, of Northampton County, was\r\ninaugurated as Governor of Pennsylvania. He had defeated Joseph Ritner,\r\nwho attempted to seek this high office on the rising wave of the\r\nanti-Masonic era, which at this time changed the political horizon of\r\nthe State and Nation.\r\n\r\nGovernor Wolf stepped into office at the time the financial affairs were\r\nin a deplorable condition. His only remedy was to push the public works\r\nto rapid completion. This was done, and in a few years he, with others,\r\nhad the proud satisfaction of beholding how far these needed\r\nimprovements went toward developing the natural resources of\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Major George Washington Meets French\r\n                    Commander Joncaire at Logstown,\r\n                           November 30, 1753\r\n\r\n\r\nThe contention between Great Britain and France for the possession of\r\nwhat is now Western Pennsylvania began about the middle of the\r\neighteenth century. The Treaty of Aix la Chapelle, signed October 18,\r\n1748, while it nominally closed the war between those two countries,\r\nfailed to establish the boundaries between their respective colonies in\r\nAmerica, and this failure, together with the hostile and conflicting\r\nattitude of the colonists in America, was the cause of another long and\r\nbloody war.\r\n\r\nAn association was formed in Virginia about 1748, called the Ohio\r\nCompany, which was given a royal grant. The object of the company,\r\naccording to its charter, was to trade with the Indians, but its actual\r\npurpose was to settle the region about the forks of the Ohio, now\r\nPittsburgh, with English colonists from Virginia and Maryland.\r\n\r\nAll the vast territory from the Mississippi to the Alleghany Mountains,\r\nsouth of the Great Lakes, had been explored and partly occupied by the\r\nFrench. They had forts, trading posts and missions at various points and\r\nthey made every endeavor to conciliate the Indians. It was apparent they\r\nintended to extend their occupancy to the extreme tributaries of the\r\nOhio, which they claimed by virtue of prior discovery.\r\n\r\nSo it was but natural when the English sought to gain a permanent\r\noccupancy of the Ohio Valley that the French should begin actively to\r\nassert their claims to the same region.\r\n\r\nThe Governor-General of Canada, the Marquis de la Galissoniere, sent\r\nCaptain Bienville de Celeron in 1749 down the Allegheny and Ohio Rivers\r\nto take possession in the name of the King of France. His command\r\nconsisted of two hundred and fifteen French and Canadian soldiers and\r\nfifty-five Indians. The principal officers under him were Captain\r\nContrecœur, who afterwards built Fort Duquesne, Coulon de Villiers, and\r\nJoncaire-Chabet.\r\n\r\nThey planted leaden plates, properly inscribed, at different points,\r\nbeginning at the present town of Warren, and then along the Allegheny\r\nRiver, then along the Ohio, and up the Miami, and they reached Lake\r\nErie, October 19, 1749.\r\n\r\nThe French affairs were actively pushed by Joncaire-Chabet, who occupied\r\nthe house at the mouth of French Creek, or Venango, which had been built\r\nby John Frazer, a Pennsylvania trader, whom Celeron drove off when he\r\nfound him there.\r\n\r\nEarly in January, 1753, a French expedition consisting of 300 men under\r\ncommand of Monsieur Babier set out from Quebec. Traveling over land and\r\nice, they reached Fort Niagara in April, then pushed on to the\r\nsoutheastern shore of Lake Erie, at the mouth of Chautauqua Creek. In\r\nMay Monsieur Morin arrived with an additional force of 500 men, and he\r\nassumed command.\r\n\r\nIt was intended to build a fort here, but the water was found to be too\r\nshallow and the expedition moved to a place which, from the peculiar\r\nformation of the lake shore, they named Presqu’ Isle, or the Peninsula.\r\nThis is now the City of Erie.\r\n\r\nHere the first fort was built and named Fort la Presqu’ Isle. It was\r\nconstructed of square logs, was about 120 feet square and fifteen feet\r\nhigh. It was finished in June, 1753 and garrisoned by about 100 men\r\nunder command of Captain Depontency.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the forces cut a road southward about fifteen miles to\r\nLe Boeuf River, or French Creek. Here they built a second fort, which\r\nthey called Fort Le Boeuf, similar to the first, but smaller. This is\r\nthe site of the present Borough of Waterford, Erie County, Pa.\r\n\r\nIn 1752 a treaty had been entered into with the Indians which secured\r\nthe right of occupancy, and twelve families, headed by Captain\r\nChristopher Gist, established themselves on the Monongahela, and\r\nsubsequently commenced the erection of a fort where the City of\r\nPittsburgh now stands.\r\n\r\nThe activity of the French alarmed these settlers, and soon all their\r\nproceedings were reported to Governor Dinwiddie, of Virginia. He\r\ndetermined to send an official communication to the commander of the\r\nFrench, who had established his headquarters at Fort Le Boeuf,\r\nprotesting against the forcible interference with their chartered\r\nrights, granted by the Crown of Britain, pointing to the late treaties\r\nof peace entered into between the English and French, whereby it was\r\nagreed that each should respect the colonial possessions of the other.\r\n\r\nGeorge Washington, then only twenty-three years old, was selected for\r\nthis mission by Governor Dinwiddie. He performed his duty with the\r\ngreatest tact and to the satisfaction of his Government.\r\n\r\nWith a party of seven besides himself, among whom was Christopher Gist,\r\nhe set out November 15, 1753, from Wills Creek, the site of Fort\r\nCumberland, in Maryland, which was the limit of the road that had been\r\nopened by the Ohio Company.\r\n\r\nThe first place of importance was Logstown, where they arrived on\r\nNovember 30. This important Indian village was on the right bank of the\r\nOhio River, about fourteen miles below the present Pittsburgh. It was at\r\nLogstown where the Treaty of 1752 was made. Here Washington enlisted the\r\nservices of the chief Indians and proceeded on his mission.\r\n\r\nWashington writes in his journal that they set out from Logstown for\r\nVenango about 9 o’clock in the morning, with Tanacharison, the\r\nHalf-King, Jeskakake, White Thunder and the Hunter, and arrived at\r\nVenango on December 4.\r\n\r\nSoon as Captain Joncaire had finished his greetings wine was passed and\r\nafter much drinking all restraint was banished, which gave license to\r\ntheir tongues and their true sentiments were revealed.\r\n\r\nThe French officers told young Washington that it was their absolute\r\ndesign to take possession of the Ohio, to which they had undoubted right\r\nfrom a discovery made by LaSalle sixty years since. They also told him\r\nthey had raised an expedition to prevent the English from settling on\r\nthe river.\r\n\r\nJoncaire endeavored by every means to win the Half-King from the\r\nEnglish, but the chief remained true to his mission, and accompanied\r\nWashington to Le Boeuf, to which place he was referred, as the\r\ncommanding officer of the French had his headquarters there.\r\n\r\nThe party arrived at Fort Le Boeuf on December 11. Washington was\r\nreceived with courtesy by the commandant, Legardeur de Saint-Pierre.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the message of Governor Dinwiddie, Saint-Pierre replied\r\nthat he would forward it to the Governor-General of Canada, but that in\r\nthe meantime, his orders were to hold possession of the country, and\r\nthis he would do to the best of his ability.\r\n\r\nWith this answer Washington retraced his steps, enduring many hardships\r\nand passing through many perils, until he presented his report to the\r\nGovernor at Williamsburg, Va., January 16, 1754.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               William Penn and Family Arrive in Province\r\n                 on His Second Visit, December 1, 1699\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain John Blackwell, an officer and one of the heroes under Cromwell,\r\nwas commissioned Deputy Governor of the Province of Pennsylvania July\r\n25, 1688, while he was in New England, but did not present himself\r\nbefore the Council until the following March. He and the Council never\r\nacted in harmony, and nothing of importance was accomplished during his\r\nshort and stormy term, which ended the following December.\r\n\r\nThomas Lloyd again became the Chief Executive. During 1691 the six\r\nCouncilors from the Lower Counties, without Lloyd’s knowledge, formed\r\nthemselves into a separate Council, appointed Judges for those counties\r\nand made ordinances.\r\n\r\nThe President and Council of the Province immediately published a\r\nproclamation declaring all the acts of the six seceding members illegal.\r\nThe latter made counter-proposals, but they were rejected.\r\n\r\nPenn tried to restore better understanding between the two sections of\r\nhis Province and gave them the choice of three modes of executive\r\ngovernment, viz., by Joint Council, by five Commissioners or by a\r\nLieutenant Governor.\r\n\r\nThe members from Pennsylvania preferred the last, but those of the Lower\r\nCounties declared for the Commissioners, but they could not agree upon\r\nany plan, so the counties of Pennsylvania elected Thomas Lloyd for their\r\nGovernor and three lower counties rejected him.\r\n\r\nPenn confirmed the appointment of Lloyd and sent William Markham, who\r\nhad joined with the protesting members, as the head of the government in\r\nthe Lower Counties. This was done against Penn’s judgment and had the\r\nconsequences he predicted.\r\n\r\nThese dissensions served to furnish the Crown with a pretext to deprive\r\nPenn of his Province. William and Mary seized this opportunity to punish\r\nhim for this attachment to the late King, and they commissioned Benjamin\r\nFletcher, Governor General of New York, also to be the Governor of\r\nPennsylvania and the territories. The Council of the Province was\r\nofficially advised of his appointment April 19, 1693.\r\n\r\nGovernor Fletcher was empowered to summon the General Assembly, require\r\nits members to subscribe to the oaths and tests prescribed by acts of\r\nparliament, and to make laws in conjunction with the Assembly, he having\r\na vote upon their acts, etc. No mention was made of William Penn, nor of\r\nthe Provincial constitution, yet, on the arrival of Colonel Fletcher at\r\nPhiladelphia, the Government was surrendered to him without objection,\r\nbut most of the Quaker magistrates refused to accept from him the\r\nrenewal of their commissions.\r\n\r\nWilliam Penn condemned this ready abandonment of his rights, and\r\naddressed a letter to Colonel Fletcher, warning him of the illegality of\r\nhis appointment, which might have restrained the latter from exercising\r\nhis authority had it been timely received, as he was attached to Penn by\r\nmany personal favors.\r\n\r\nTrouble arose when Fletcher attempted a new form of election contrary to\r\nthe laws of the Province, and the rejection of eight of the old laws,\r\nchiefly penal. The Assembly insisted that their rights should first be\r\nredressed.\r\n\r\nFletcher claimed the right to alter laws without even the assent of\r\nAssembly, and to strengthen his position threatened to annex the\r\nProvince to New York. The moderate party, rather than submit to this,\r\npreferred receiving the confirmation of their rights and liberties as a\r\nfavor at the hands of the Governor.\r\n\r\nPrior to his departure for New York, in 1694, Fletcher appointed William\r\nMarkham, the Proprietary’s cousin, to be Lieutenant Governor. Governor\r\nFletcher attended the second session of the Assembly and insisted upon\r\nfurther appropriations for public defense. The Assembly refused to\r\ncomply with Fletcher’s demand and was dissolved.\r\n\r\nThe Proprietary was not wholly in accord with the resolute refusal of\r\nthe Assembly, nor was he unmindful of the effects which such opposition\r\nto the wishes of the Crown might have upon his particular interests.\r\n\r\nWilliam Penn was now no longer under the cloud of suspicion. He had many\r\nfriends among the nobles who surrounded the King, and his true character\r\nwas at last made known.\r\n\r\nHe succeeded in obtaining a hearing before a Privy Council and was\r\nhonorably acquitted and restored to his Proprietary rights by a patent\r\ndated August, 1694, in which the disorders in the Province were ascribed\r\nsolely to his absence. Shortly before his reinstatement, William Penn’s\r\nwife, Gulielma Maria, died.\r\n\r\nPenn appointed Markham his Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania and\r\nTerritories September 24, 1694. The restoration of the former government\r\nwas not happy, for Governor Fletcher had made himself unpopular, and it\r\nwas not an easy matter for Markham to immediately gain their confidence,\r\neven though he had called the Assembly according to the forms prescribed\r\nby the charter.\r\n\r\nThe great bone of contention was the subsidy to be granted to the King.\r\nFinally a joint committee of the two branches of the Legislature was\r\nacceded to, when it was agreed to accept the new Constitution, and a new\r\nsubsidy of £300 was granted for the support of the Royal Government and\r\nof the suffering Indians. This was raised by a tax of one penny on the\r\npound on all assessed property.\r\n\r\nThe new Constitution was more democratic. The Council consisted of two\r\nfrom each county, elected biennially. The Assembly had four members from\r\neach county, elected annually. The latter was given the right to\r\noriginate bills, to sit on its adjournments and to be indissoluble\r\nduring the term for which it was elected.\r\n\r\nThis instrument was never formally sanctioned by the Proprietary and\r\ncontinued in force only until after his second arrival, when a new and\r\nmore lasting one was substituted in its place. Under it the people were\r\ncontent.\r\n\r\nWilliam Penn, accompanied by his second wife and children, sailed from\r\nEngland in the ship Canterbury in September, 1699, and on account of\r\nadverse winds had a tedious voyage of more than three months, arriving\r\nin the Delaware, December 1, 1699. Penn was cordially welcomed, it being\r\ngenerally understood that he intended to spend the remainder of his life\r\nin the Province.\r\n\r\nThe Proprietary believed the time was ripe for an entirely new form of\r\ngovernment and labored earnestly to obtain additional legislative\r\nrestrictions upon intercourse with the Indians in order to protect them\r\nfrom the artifices of the whites. Penn conferred frequently with the\r\nseveral nations of the Province, visiting them familiarly in their\r\nforests, participating in their festivals and entertaining them with\r\nmuch hospitality and state at his mansion at Pennsbury.\r\n\r\nHe formed a new treaty with the tribes located on the Susquehanna and\r\nits tributaries and also with the Five Nations. This treaty was one of\r\npeace. In 1701, William Penn took a second trip into the interior of the\r\nProvince.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Morgan Powell Cruelly Murdered by Mollie\r\n                       Maguires, December 2, 1871\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bloody record of the Mollie Maguires began about the time the Civil\r\nWar was brought to a close and continued until James McParlan, the able\r\ndetective in the employ of the Pinkerton agency, ferreted out these\r\ncriminals and brought the guilty to trials which resulted in their\r\nexecution or long terms of imprisonment.\r\n\r\nThe anthracite coal regions were not free of this scourge until 1877.\r\n\r\nThe Mollies were unusually active and bloodthirsty in 1865. August 25 of\r\nthat year, David Muir, colliery superintendent, was killed in Foster\r\nTownship, shot to death on the public highway, in broad daylight, within\r\ntwo hundred yards of the office in which he was employed.\r\n\r\nJanuary 10, 1866, Henry H. Dunne, of Pottsville, superintendent of a\r\ncolliery, was murdered on the turnpike, while riding to his home in his\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\nOctober 17, 1868, occurred the tragic death of Alexander Rae, near\r\nCentralia, Columbia County.\r\n\r\nThe next important outrage of this character was the murder of William\r\nH. Littlehales, superintendent of the Glen Carbon Coal Mining Company,\r\nMarch 15, 1869. He was killed on the highway in Cass Township,\r\nSchuylkill County, while enroute to his home in Pottsville.\r\n\r\nThen occurred the murders of F. W. S. Langdon, George K. Smith and\r\nGraham Powell, each of whom was a mining official.\r\n\r\nBut the crowning act of the Mollie Maguires, up to the time James\r\nMcParlan was engaged by Mr. Allen Pinkerton to investigate the workings\r\nof this nefarious organization, and the one reaching the culmination of\r\nmany previous and similar events, was the murder of Morgan Powell.\r\n\r\nThis event exasperated the good people of the anthracite region to the\r\npitch where endurance ceases to be a virtue, and where only desperate\r\nmethods to put a stop to these crimes can be put in operation.\r\n\r\nThis unprovoked murder occurred December 2, 1871. Morgan Powell was\r\nassistant superintendent of the Lehigh and Wilkes Barre Coal and Iron\r\nCompany, at Summit Hill, Carbon County.\r\n\r\nThe murder was committed about seven o’clock in the evening, on the main\r\nstreet of the little town, not more than twenty feet from the store of\r\nHenry Williamson, which place Powell had but a few minutes earlier left\r\nto go to the office of Mr. Zehner, the general superintendent of the\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nIt seems that one of three men, who had been seen by different parties\r\nwaiting near the store, approached Mr. Powell from the rear, close\r\nbeside a gate leading into the stables, and fired a pistol shot into the\r\nleft breast of the victim. The assassin reached over the shoulder of\r\nPowell to accomplish his deadly purpose.\r\n\r\nThe bullet passed through Powell’s body, lodged in the back near the\r\nspinal column, producing immediate paralysis of the lower limbs, and\r\nresulting in death two days afterward.\r\n\r\nThe wounded man was carried back to the store by some of his friends and\r\nhis son, Charles Powell, the latter then but fourteen years of age, and\r\nthere remained all night. The next day he was removed to the residence\r\nof Morgan Price, where he died the following day.\r\n\r\nHardly had the smoke from the murderer’s pistol mingled with the clear\r\nair of that star-lit winter evening, when the assassins were discovered\r\nrapidly making their way from the scene of their savage deed toward the\r\ntop of Plant No. 1.\r\n\r\nThey were met by the Reverend Allan John Morton and Lewis Richards, who\r\nwere hurrying to the spot to learn what had caused the firing.\r\n\r\nMr. Morton asked, as they halted on the rigging-stand, what was the\r\ntrouble, when one of the three strangers answered: “I guess a man has\r\nbeen shot!”\r\n\r\nDescriptions of the three men were remembered by the Reverend Morgan and\r\nMr. Richards, and the trio started forward in the direction in which Mr.\r\nPowell had pointed when asked which way the attacking party had gone.\r\n\r\n“I'm shot to death! My lower limbs have no feeling in them!” exclaimed\r\nMr. Powell, when Williamson first raised his head.\r\n\r\nNo one could tell who shot him. The three suspects were strangers.\r\n\r\nPatrick Kildea, who was thought to resemble one of them, was arrested\r\nand tried, but finally acquitted, from lack of evidence to convict.\r\nThis, for the time, was the end of the matter.\r\n\r\nWhen McParlan, disguised as James McKenna, was working on the case of\r\nthe murder of B. F. Yost, of Tamaqua, in 1875, he learned first-handed\r\nfrom John Donahue, alias “Yellow Jack,” that he was the murderer of\r\nMorgan Powell.\r\n\r\nDonahue related the circumstances to his “friend” and named his two\r\nconfederates. He bragged of the affair as being a clean job.\r\n\r\nHe said the escape was easy, as they did not go ten yards from the spot\r\nwhere Powell dropped, until the excitement cooled down, when, in the\r\ndarkness, they quietly departed from the bushes, and reached their homes\r\nin safety.\r\n\r\nThe detective made mental notes of this disclosure, and his report\r\nsubsequently transmitted to his superiors was the first light upon this\r\ncrime, which had, for four years baffled the best efforts of the\r\nofficers of justice.\r\n\r\nThe time was not ripe to press Donahue for more details, but as the\r\ndetective was supposed to have recently assisted in a murder, Donahue\r\ntalked freely with him about others who were soon to be victims of the\r\nMollies.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1876, when the arrests of the Mollies were made, John\r\nDonahue, Thomas P. Fisher, Patrick McKenna, Alexander Campbell, Patrick\r\nO'Donnell, and John Malloy were taken in Carbon County, charged with the\r\nmurder of Morgan Powell, at Summit Hill, December 2, 1871.\r\n\r\nThe defendants were tried at different terms of the Carbon County Court,\r\nat Mauch Chunk. James McParlan, the detective, now in his true\r\ncharacter, frequently appeared as a witness and testified to the\r\nconfessions of the Mollies.\r\n\r\nThey were found guilty as follows: Donahue of murder in the first\r\ndegree, Fisher of murder in the first degree, McKenna of murder in the\r\nfirst degree, and O'Donnell as an accessory. McKenna served nine years\r\nand O'Donnell five years’ imprisonment.\r\n\r\nThus was the death of Morgan Powell avenged.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 General Anthony Wayne Defeats Indians;\r\n                   Congress Ratifies Treaty, December\r\n                                3, 1795\r\n\r\n\r\nCongress ratified the treaty made at Greenville by General Anthony\r\nWayne, December 3, 1795. This is one of the few such treaties the\r\nprovisions of which were respected.\r\n\r\nAnthony Wayne was a member of the convention which met in Philadelphia\r\nand adopted a paper, drawn by John Dickinson, which recommended the\r\nAssembly to appoint delegates to a Congress of the Colonies. He was one\r\nof four members of that committee who became distinguished generals in\r\nthe Revolution. His father had been an officer in the French and Indian\r\nWar and Anthony studied surveying, but his attention was more centered\r\non things military.\r\n\r\nAt the age of twenty he managed an expedition sent to Nova Scotia in the\r\ninterest of Great Britain. On the very day that the battle of Lexington\r\nwas fought he was made a member of the Pennsylvania Committee of Safety.\r\n\r\nHe was made a colonel of one of the first regiments raised by\r\nPennsylvania and soon was engaged in the perilous Canadian campaign.\r\n\r\nWayne then was given command of Fort Ticonderoga, which Ethan Allen had\r\ncaptured “in the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental\r\nCongress.” During this tour of duty he was made a brigadier general and\r\nbegged General Washington for more active service.\r\n\r\nHe was called to general headquarters at Morristown and given command of\r\neight Pennsylvania regiments. These he taught to fight.\r\n\r\nGeneral Wayne fought bravely at Brandywine, and after Howe captured\r\nPhiladelphia Washington posted him to watch the British and annoy them\r\nwhile the main army was being put in better condition to meet the enemy.\r\n\r\nThrough the betrayal of his position by a Tory, Wayne’s command was\r\nsurprised at Paoli, when more than sixty of his soldiers were stabbed to\r\ndeath by the British bayonets. It was due to no fault of General Wayne\r\nand he managed to march away most of his men in good order.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks later the Battle of Germantown was fought and Wayne’s troops\r\nhad a chance to make a bayonet attack upon the same soldiers who had\r\nrushed into their camp at Paoli. “They took ample vengeance for that\r\nnight’s work,” said Wayne. He was delighted to see his Pennsylvanians\r\nbeat the British at their own style of fighting.\r\n\r\nWayne’s troops suffered through the long winter following at Valley\r\nForge, and none worked harder to relieve their distress than did the\r\npopular general.\r\n\r\nWashington dispatched Wayne on a foraging expedition through New Jersey\r\nfor much-needed supplies, and in spite of several skirmishes with\r\nBritish troops on the same mission Wayne brought back the supplies.\r\n\r\nWhen Howe evacuated Philadelphia and Washington followed him across New\r\nJersey, it was Wayne who encouraged Washington to fight the enemy. The\r\nBattle of Monmouth resulted, and it was Wayne’s line which held back the\r\nBritish until Washington could move up the rest of his army.\r\n\r\nIn Washington’s report to Congress about this battle he mentioned only\r\none general by name, General Anthony Wayne.\r\n\r\nWayne’s most daring exploit was the capture of Stony Point, on the\r\nHudson. This was accomplished by 1300 men in a bayonet attack at night.\r\nWayne was wounded and afterward was spoken of by envious officers as\r\n“Mad Anthony.”\r\n\r\nHe performed conspicuous service at Yorktown, and was afterward sent to\r\nGeorgia, where he fought Indians as well as British. The State of\r\nGeorgia gave Wayne a rice plantation in token of gratitude.\r\n\r\nAfter Washington resigned the active command of the army, General Josiah\r\nHarmar, one of a family living along the Perkiomen, succeeded him.\r\nHarmar led an expedition against the Miami Indians in the Northwest in\r\n1790, but was defeated.\r\n\r\nGeneral Arthur St. Clair, who had been a major general of the\r\nPennsylvania Line and President of the Continental Congress, succeeded\r\nHarmar. St. Clair at the time was also Governor of the Northwestern\r\nTerritory. He, too, suffered a humiliating defeat in a serious\r\nengagement November 4, 1791, by the Miami, led by their chiefs and aided\r\nby Simon Girty, the notorious Tory and renegade, another Pennsylvanian.\r\n\r\nAfter his reverse Washington appointed Anthony Wayne a major general and\r\nput him in command of the Army of the United States. The Indians were\r\naided by the British.\r\n\r\nWithin seven years they had killed 1500 people, and their object was to\r\nprevent the settlements beyond the Ohio River.\r\n\r\nGeneral Wayne organized an army of 2631 men at Pittsburgh. A large\r\nproportion of the soldiers were Pennsylvanians.\r\n\r\nThe war lasted more than two years. Wayne moved his army down the Ohio,\r\nthence to the site of Cincinnati, to the Miami River, 400 miles into the\r\nwilderness.\r\n\r\nOn August 20, 1794, at the Fallen Timbers he encountered a force of 2000\r\nIndians and won the most important victory ever secured over the Indian\r\nfoes. Almost all the dead warriors were found with British arms.\r\n\r\nWayne laid waste their country and by the middle of September moved up\r\nto the junction of the St. Mary’s and St. Joseph’s Rivers, near the\r\npresent City of Fort Wayne, Ind., and built a strong fortification,\r\nwhich he named Fort Wayne. The little army wintered at Greenville, O.\r\nThe barbarians realized their weakness and sued for peace.\r\n\r\nWayne returned to Philadelphia to report his operations. As he\r\napproached the city the cavalry troops met him as a guard of honor. When\r\nhe crossed the ferry over the Schuylkill a salute of fifteen guns was\r\nfired, and the bells of the city pealed their acclaim. The people\r\ncrowded the sidewalks to catch a glimpse of the victorious general.\r\nCongress voted him its thanks.\r\n\r\nThe following summer 1130 sachems and warriors, representing twelve\r\ntribes or nations, met at Greenville on August 3 and concluded a treaty\r\nthe basis of which was that hostilities should permanently cease and all\r\nprisoners be restored. The boundary line between the United States and\r\nthe lands of the several tribes was fixed. It made possible the\r\nsettlement of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and the West.\r\n\r\nWhen this treaty was successfully concluded Wayne embarked in a schooner\r\nat Detroit for his home in Chester County. He was taken ill with his old\r\ncomplaint, the gout, and landed at Presqu’ Isle in great physical\r\ndistress. Before an army surgeon could reach him he died in the\r\nBlock-House there, December 15, 1796.\r\n\r\nBury me at the foot of the flagstaff, boys,” he ordered, and his command\r\nwas obeyed. Thirteen years later his son, Colonel Isaac Wayne, removed\r\nhis remains to Radnor churchyard, in Delaware County, over which the\r\nPennsylvania State Society of Cincinnati erected an elegant white marble\r\nmonument.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnti-Masonic Period Terminates in Trouble on December 4, 1838\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the campaign of 1838 Governor Joseph Ritner was renominated by the\r\nFusionist Whig-Anti-Masonic-Abolitionist Party for the office of\r\nGovernor, and David R. Porter, of Huntingdon, was the nominee of the\r\nDemocratic organization for the same office.\r\n\r\nThe campaign was one of vituperation and personal abuse of the\r\ncandidates unparalleled in the history of politics.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of the election became known it showed that Porter had\r\nbeen elected by a majority of 5540 votes.\r\n\r\nImmediately thereafter Secretary of the Commonwealth Thomas H. Burrowes,\r\nwho was also chairman of the Anti-Masonic State Committee, issued a\r\ncircular to the “Friends of Governor Ritner,” calling upon them to\r\n“treat the election held on October 9 as if it had never taken place.”\r\nThis circular had the desired effect and the defeated Anti-Masonic and\r\nweak candidates for the Legislature contested the seats of their\r\nsuccessful Democratic competitors on the slightest pretext.\r\n\r\nThaddeus Stevens said at a public meeting in the Courthouse at\r\nGettysburg that “the Anti-Masons would organize the House, and if\r\nGovernor Porter were declared elected the Legislature would elect Canal\r\nCommissioners for three years and then adjourn before date fixed by the\r\nnew Constitution for the inauguration, and that Porter would never be\r\nGovernor.”\r\n\r\nAs the time approached for the meeting of the Legislature on December 4,\r\ntrouble was anticipated and “Committees on Safety” were appointed in\r\nnearly all of the counties, while many persons, especially from the\r\ndistricts in which contests were expected, flocked to Harrisburg to\r\nwitness the result of the struggle.\r\n\r\nIt may not be generally known, but there had been a secret meeting\r\ncomposed of Burrowes, Stevens and Fenn, none of whom was born in\r\nPennsylvania, at which were suggested some strong revolutionary\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nAfter the excitement was over the Legislature settled down to business,\r\nand Governor Porter having been inaugurated, it was seriously considered\r\nwhether these men should not be tried for treason.\r\n\r\nThe House then consisted of 100 members, eight of whom were from\r\nPhiladelphia, whose seats were contested, and of the remaining number\r\nforty-eight were Democrats and forty-four anti-Masonic Whigs. The\r\nmajority of the Senate belonged to the latter party, and consequently\r\npromptly organized by the election of Charles B. Penrose as Speaker.\r\n\r\nIn the House the clerk read the names of the members as given him by the\r\nSecretary of the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nUpon reading the returns from Philadelphia County it was discovered that\r\nthe legal returns had been withheld and fraudulent ones substituted.\r\nThis had been anticipated, as the Secretary of the Commonwealth had\r\ndetermined to seat the minority members, thus compelling the majority to\r\nbe contestants and to witness the organization of the House. The\r\nDemocrats produced and read the true returns, as duly certified by the\r\nProthonotary of Philadelphia. This seated both sets of contesting\r\ndelegates and caused the wildest excitement.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Thaddeus Stevens moved that the House proceed to the\r\nelection of the Speaker. The clerk then called the roll of the Whig and\r\nAnti-Masonic members and declared Thomas S. Cunningham, of Beaver\r\nCounty, elected. He was conducted to the Speaker’s chair and took his\r\nseat.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats paid very little attention to the movements of the\r\nopposition and elected William Hopkins, of Washington County, Speaker.\r\nTwo members escorted Mr. Hopkins to the platform, where Mr. Cunningham\r\nhad already been seated.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania House of Representatives thus enjoyed a double-headed\r\norganization. The members of the House of each party were then sworn in\r\nby their respective officers—fifty-two members who had elected Mr.\r\nCunningham and fifty-six members who elected Mr. Hopkins.\r\n\r\nAfter some necessary routine the Governor and the Senate were informed\r\nthe House was ready to proceed to business; then both bodies adjourned\r\ntheir respective organizations to meet next day at 10 o’clock.\r\n\r\nThe Cunningham party did not wait until its appointed time. In the\r\nafternoon they met again in the hall, and after being called to order by\r\ntheir Speaker, he called Mr. Spackman, of Philadelphia, to act as\r\nSpeaker pro tem. Some Philadelphians who were in the lobby as\r\nspectators, feeling indignant at the proceedings of the Cunningham\r\nparty, went up to the platform and carried Spackman off and sat him down\r\nin the aisle.\r\n\r\nThis interference from outsiders could not be resented by the rump House\r\nand it immediately adjourned amid great confusion. They afterwards met\r\nin Matthew Wilson’s Hall, until recently known as the Lochiel Hotel.\r\nDuring these exciting scenes large crowds gathered outside the Capitol\r\nand became boisterous. The aspect of affairs appeared alarming.\r\n\r\nWhile the foregoing incidents were transpiring in the House, there were\r\ncontests for seats in the Senate from several districts. Upon the floor\r\nwere members of the House, among them Thaddeus Stevens and Secretary of\r\nthe Commonwealth Burrowes, of Lancaster, who had gone there with\r\nminority returns. These two individuals, who controlled the Executive,\r\nwere of the opinion that the first returns received were to have\r\nprecedence.\r\n\r\nA large crowd in the rear of the Senate Chamber was composed of excited\r\nand enraged citizens, especially toward those who were working to seat\r\nHanna and Wagner, of Philadelphia, in place of those legally entitled to\r\nthe seats. Threats of violence were heard.\r\n\r\nThe clerk had opened and read the returns, as far as Philadelphia. When\r\nthose were reached, Charles Brown, who had been elected on the majority\r\nreturn, arose and presented to the Speaker what he said was a copy of\r\nthe true return, alleging the other false. The Speaker attempted to stop\r\nhim, but the crowd insisted that Brown be heard. Brown was allowed to\r\nproceed, and during his remarks the crowds in the lobby and gallery\r\nshouted, threatening violence to Penrose, Burrowes and Stevens.\r\n\r\nThe scene was now one of fearful confusion, disorder and terror, and at\r\nlast Speaker Penrose, unable to stem the current any longer, abandoned\r\nhis post, and with Stevens and Burrowes escaped through a window in the\r\nrear of the Senate Chamber. The Senate adjourned until next day.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the first day of the session a large public meeting was\r\nheld in the Courthouse over which General Thomas Craig Miller, of Adams\r\nCounty, presided.\r\n\r\nThe Governor then issued a proclamation which stated that “a lawless,\r\ninfuriated, armed mob, from the counties of Philadelphia, Lancaster,\r\nAdams and other places, have assembled at the seat of government with\r\nthe avowed object of disturbing, interrupting and overawing the\r\nLegislature of this Commonwealth and of preventing its proper\r\norganization and the peaceful and free discharge of its duties. This mob\r\nhad entered the Senate Chamber and threatened the lives of the members\r\nand it still remained in the city in force, etc.”\r\n\r\nThe Governor called upon the civil authorities, the military force of\r\nthe Commonwealth and the citizens to hold themselves in readiness for\r\ninstant duty.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Troops Called Out in “Buck Shot War” on\r\n                            December 5, 1838\r\n\r\n\r\nAmid all the excitement of the first day of the “Buckshot” War, December\r\n4, 1837, at the moment Governor Joseph Ritner had issued his\r\nproclamation calling upon the people to disperse the lawless element and\r\nto add further excitement, the State Arsenal was seized by friends of\r\nthe Governor, where large quantities of powder and cartridges were\r\nstored. The proclamation and call for troops and the seizure of the\r\narsenal filled the city of Harrisburg with intense alarm.\r\n\r\nWilliam Cochran, Sheriff of Dauphin County, issued a proclamation in\r\nwhich he stated that at no time had there been any riotous proceedings,\r\nnor any disturbances which rendered necessary his interposition as a\r\ncivil officer to preserve peace.\r\n\r\nThe following day, December 5, the Governor made a requisition on Major\r\nGeneral Robert Patterson, commanding the First Division Pennsylvania\r\nMilitia to furnish sufficient of his command to “quell this\r\ninsurrection.”\r\n\r\nGeneral Patterson obtained from the Frankford Arsenal a supply of the\r\nregular ammunition for infantry, which was then buckshot. About a\r\nhundred of General Patterson’s command arrived in Harrisburg, on\r\nSaturday night, December 8, and the next afternoon 800 troops arrived.\r\nThey were paraded through the streets to the public grounds in front of\r\nthe State Arsenal.\r\n\r\nThe general and his staff reported to the Governor. The door was locked\r\nand barred, and the general could not gain admittance until the Governor\r\nlearned from a second-story window who was seeking an entrance.\r\n\r\nThe Governor sent for his Cabinet, and five responded. They asked the\r\nGeneral many questions, among others, if he would obey an order of the\r\nSpeaker of the Senate, to which he replied in the negative. He said he\r\nhad not come on a political mission, and anyway, would not sustain a\r\nparty clearly in the wrong.\r\n\r\nHe was asked if he would obey an order from the Speaker of the House. He\r\nreplied he would not, for two reasons: They had two Speakers, he did not\r\nknow the right one, and he would not obey the regular Speaker anyway, as\r\nhe had no right to give him an order. He said he would obey only the\r\nGovernor, and then only when the Governor gave him an order he had a\r\nright to give.\r\n\r\nGeneral Patterson refused to help seat either Speaker. He said the House\r\nalone could do that. If ordered to fire, he would refuse to issue the\r\norder. Nor would he permit a single shot to be fired except in\r\nself-defense, if assailed by the rebels, or in the protection of public\r\nproperty. The conference ended abruptly.\r\n\r\nThe Governor had called upon Captain Sumner, then in command of the\r\nCarlisle Barracks, for troops, but he refused to send them to interfere\r\nin political troubles.\r\n\r\nGovernor Ritner also wrote to President Van Buren, laying before him a\r\nfull account of the affair, requesting the President to take such\r\nmeasures as would protect the State against violence. The Governor named\r\nseveral Government officials who were active in the trouble.\r\n\r\nThe Governor’s party finding they could not get General Patterson to\r\ninstall them in power, his troops were ordered home and a requisition\r\nwas made upon Major General Alexander, of the Eleventh Division of State\r\nMilitia, a citizen of Carlisle, and an ultra-Whig in politics.\r\n\r\nOut of three companies only sixty-seven men responded. The battalion,\r\nunder the command of Colonel Willis Foulk, marched from Carlisle to\r\nHarrisburg, December 15, arriving on the following day.\r\n\r\nThere never had been occasion for soldiers and now as the Carlisle\r\ntroops arrived the disturbance in the Legislature was nearing an end.\r\nThe soldiers regarded the trip as a frolic.\r\n\r\nOn December 17 Messrs. Butler and Sturdevant, of Luzerne, and Montelius,\r\nof Union County, three legally elected Whig members, abandoned their\r\nAnti-Masonic associates and were sworn in as members of the “Hopkins\r\nHouse,” which gave it a legal quorum over and above the eight Democrats\r\nfrom Philadelphia whose rights the “Rump House” disputed.\r\n\r\nFinally on December 27, Mr. Michler, of Northampton County, submitted a\r\nresolution which recognized that the House was now legally organized,\r\nand it was adopted, by the close vote of seventeen yeas to sixteen nays.\r\n\r\nThe committee called for in the resolution was named and waited on the\r\nGovernor, informing him the Legislature was organized.\r\n\r\nWith this reconciliation the returns were opened and read; the amendment\r\nto the Constitution was declared carried and the election of David R.\r\nPorter as Governor of the Commonwealth promulgated. However, the\r\nanimosity still existed, and resulted in the appointment by both Houses\r\nof select committees to inquire into the causes of the disturbances and\r\nother matters.\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens, the ring leader, refused at first to be reconciled, and\r\nabsented himself several months from the sessions of the House. It was\r\nnot until May 8 that his colleague in the House announced that Mr.\r\nStevens was now in his seat and ready to take the requisite\r\nqualifications.\r\n\r\nObjection was made, and a resolution offered declaring that Mr. Stevens\r\nhad “forfeited that right by act in violation of the laws of the land,\r\nby contempt to the House, and by the virtual resignation of his\r\ncharacter as a representative.” Action was postponed.\r\n\r\nOn the following day Mr. Stevens again appeared, and, through his\r\ncolleague, demanded that the oath be administered. This was on motion\r\npostponed by a vote of forty-eight to thirty. Two days afterward Mr.\r\nStevens appeared a third time, but by a vote of fifty-three to\r\nthirty-three the question was postponed, and a committee appointed to\r\nexamine whether he had not forfeited his right to a seat as a member.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th this committee reported that he was “not entitled” to his\r\nseat.\r\n\r\nThe House, however, by declaring his seat vacant, caused an election,\r\nwhen Mr. Stevens was again returned and appearing, was duly qualified.\r\n\r\nMr. Penrose, the Speaker of the Senate, issued a manifesto “To the\r\nPeople of the State,” explaining his participation in the proceedings of\r\nDecember 4.\r\n\r\nSubsequently a number of pamphlets appeared, chiefly of the facetious\r\nclass, which attempted to make a farce of what might have resulted in a\r\nvery serious affair. One of these severely criticized Secretary Burrowes\r\nfor withholding the correct and legal returns; Speaker Penrose for the\r\nviolation of his duty; the six Senators who were denounced as traitors\r\nand the last paragraph was:\r\n\r\n“Finally, if the leaders of the party who claimed to be ‘all the\r\ndecency,’ and were the first to cry out mob, had behaved themselves\r\nhonorably and honestly there would have been no ‘Buckshot War,’ and\r\nperhaps they would not have so soon been compelled to witness the 'Last\r\nKick of Anti-Masonry.'”\r\n\r\nThe piper was now to pay and it took many years to heal the political\r\nsores. The Anti-Masonic crusade had come to an end, and from that date\r\nMasonry and Odd Fellowship, those “twin sisters of iniquity,” as\r\nThaddeus Stevens designated them, thrived more than ever. The term\r\n“Buckshot War,” was a thorn in the side of its leaders.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             De Vries Finds Entire Dutch Colony Destroyed,\r\n                            December 6, 1632\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dutch were the first Europeans to pursue explorations in the New\r\nWorld, and as early as 1609, sent Henry Hudson on an expedition to\r\nAmerica, where he arrived at the head of Delaware Bay, August 28 of that\r\nyear. Hudson later sailed up the New Jersey Coast and anchored off Sandy\r\nHook, September 3; nine days later entered New York Bay through the\r\nNarrows, and entered the great river that since has borne his name.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch East India Company received glowing reports from its navigator\r\nand immediately set in motion other expeditions to the New Netherlands.\r\n\r\nBefore 1614 a fleet of five vessels, under command of Captain Cornelius\r\nJacobson Mey, arrived in Delaware Bay, and two years later Cornelius\r\nHendrickson sailed up the Delaware and discovered the mouth of the\r\nSchuylkill, the present site of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nIn 1621 the Dutch West India Company was chartered and in 1623 Captain\r\nMey built Fort Nassau about five miles above Wilmington, Del., on the\r\neastern shore. Another settlement of a few families was made farther\r\nnorth upon the same side of the river, but in 1631 no white man had made\r\na settlement on the west bank of the Delaware River.\r\n\r\nIn that year there came to the southern cape, now Henlopen, a party of\r\ncolonists from Holland, under David Pieterson De Vries, of Hoorn, “a\r\nbold and skillful seaman,” and the finest personage in the settlement of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nOn December 12, 1630, a ship and a yacht for the Zuydt Revier (South\r\nRiver) were sent from the Texel “with a number of people and a large\r\nstock of cattle,” the object being, said De Vries, “as well to carry on\r\na whale fishery in that region, as to plant a colony for the cultivation\r\nof all sorts of grain, for which the country is well adapted, and of\r\ntobacco.”\r\n\r\nThese colonists made a settlement near the present town of Lewes and\r\ncalled it Swanendael, or the Valley of the Swans. They built a\r\nsubstantial house, surrounded it with palisades, and began their\r\nsettlement. A few weeks later the Walrus sailed on its return to Holland\r\nwith De Vries aboard, who left the colony in charge of Gilles Hosset,\r\nwho had come out as “commissary.” This colony was destined to be the\r\nmost unfortunate and of short duration.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1632 De Vries agreed with his associates in Holland to go out\r\nto Swanendael himself. He fitted out two vessels, and with them set sail\r\nfrom the Texel, May 24, 1632, to be in good time at his colony, for the\r\nwinter fishery. The whales, he understood, “come in the winter, and\r\nremained until March.”\r\n\r\nAs he was leaving Holland the bad news reached him that Swanendael had\r\nbeen destroyed by the Indians. The expedition proceeded, however, and it\r\nwas December 5 when they reached Cape Cornelius and found the melancholy\r\nreport only too true.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th De Vries went ashore to view the desolate place. He says:\r\n\r\n“I found lying here and there the skulls and bones of our people, and\r\nthe heads of the horses and cows which they had brought with them.”\r\n\r\nNo Indians were visible, so he went aboard the boat and let the gunner\r\nfire a shot to see if he could find any trace of them. The next day some\r\nIndians appeared.\r\n\r\nIn the conferences which followed, De Vries obtained some explanation of\r\nthe disaster. It seems to have been the result of a misunderstanding. An\r\nIndian, who was induced to remain on board all night December 8,\r\nrehearsed the story. Commissary Hosset set up a pole, upon which was\r\nfastened a piece of tin bearing the arms of The Netherlands, as an\r\nevidence of its claim and profession.\r\n\r\nAn Indian, seeing the glitter of the tin, ignorant of the object of this\r\nexhibition and unconscious of the right of exclusive property,\r\nappropriated to his own use this honored symbol “for the purpose of\r\nmaking tobacco pipes.”\r\n\r\nThe Dutch regarded the offense as an affair of state, not merely a\r\nlarceny, and Hosset urged his complaints and demands for redress with so\r\nmuch vehemence that the perplexed tribe brought him the head of the\r\noffender. This was a punishment which Hosset neither wished nor had\r\nforeseen, and he dreaded its consequences.\r\n\r\nIn vain he reprehended the severity of the Indians, and told them had\r\nthey brought the delinquent to him, he would have been dismissed with a\r\nreprimand. The love of vengeance, inseparable from the Indian character,\r\nsought a dire gratification; and, though the culprit was executed by his\r\nown tribe, still they beheld its cause in the exaction of the strangers.\r\n\r\nAvailing themselves of the season in which many of the Dutch were\r\nengaged in the cultivation of the fields, at a distance from their\r\nhouse, the Indians entered it, under the amicable pretense of trade, and\r\nmurdered the unsuspicious Hosset, also a sentinel who attended him. They\r\nproceeded to the fields, fell upon the laborers and massacred every\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\nDe Vries did not put the blame on Hosset, but the colony was ruined.\r\nNeither did he chastise the natives nor send out a punitive expedition\r\nagainst them; more bloodshed would not heal the wounds already made.\r\nWith a view to future fishing, he exchanged some goods with the Indians,\r\nand made an engagement of peace.\r\n\r\nOn January 1, 1634, he proceeded up the river and on the 6th arrived at\r\nFort Nassau. It was now deserted, except by Indians. He was suspicious\r\nof these, and traded with extreme caution. He remained in the vicinity\r\nof the fort for four days, ever on the alert. He nearly fell a victim\r\nhere to the perfidy of the natives.\r\n\r\nThey directed him to haul his yacht into the narrow Timmer-Kill, which\r\nfurnished a convenient place for an attack, but he was warned by a\r\nfemale of the tribe of their design, and told the English crew of a\r\nvessel which had been sent from Virginia to explore the river the\r\nSeptember previous had been murdered. De Vries then hastened to Fort\r\nNassau, which he found filled with savages.\r\n\r\nOn January 10 he drifted his yacht off on the ebbtide, anchored at noon\r\n“on the bar at Jacques Island” and on the 13th rejoined his ship at\r\nSwanendael.\r\n\r\nJacques Island has been identified as Little Tinicum, opposite the\r\ngreater Tinicum which is now part of Delaware County. The kill in which\r\nhe lay was therefore Ridley, or perhaps Chester Creek. In either case,\r\nit seems, De Vries was then within the State of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nIn April De Vries returned to Holland. Thus at the expiration of\r\ntwenty-five years from the discovery of the Delaware by Hudson, not a\r\nsingle European remained upon its shores.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Fires of Early Days; First Fire Fighting\r\n                   Company Organized December 7, 1736\r\n\r\n\r\nThe City of Philadelphia had not been laid out one year until it was\r\nvisited by a fire, the sufferers being some recently arrived Germans and\r\nfor whose relief a subscription was made.\r\n\r\nFrom this time until 1696 no public precautions seem to have been taken\r\nagainst fire. In the latter year the Provincial Assembly passed a law\r\nfor preventing accidents that might happen by fire in the towns of\r\nPhiladelphia and New Castle, by which persons were forbidden to fire\r\ntheir chimneys to cleanse them, or suffer them to be so foul as to take\r\nfire, under a penalty of forty shillings, and each house owner was\r\nrequired to provide and keep ready a swab twelve or fourteen feet long,\r\nand a bucket or pail, under a penalty of ten shillings.\r\n\r\nNo person should presume to smoke tobacco in the streets, either by day\r\nor night, under a penalty of twelve pence. All such fines were to be\r\nused to buy leather buckets and other instruments or engines against\r\nfires for the public use.\r\n\r\nAn act was passed in 1700, applying to Philadelphia, Bristol,\r\nGermantown, Darby and Chester, which provided for two leather buckets,\r\nand forbade more than six pounds of powder to be kept in any house or\r\nshop, unless forty perches distant from any dwelling house, under the\r\npenalty of ten pounds. A year later the magistrates were directed to\r\nprocure “six or eight good hooks for tearing down houses on fire.”\r\n\r\nAs the city grew, fires became more frequent, through faulty constructed\r\nchimneys and the general use of wood for fuel. Mayor Samuel Preston in\r\n1711 recommended the purchase of buckets, hooks and an engine. In\r\nDecember, 1718, the City Council purchased of Abraham Bickley a fire\r\nengine he had imported from England for £50. This fire engine was then\r\nin Bethlehem. It was the first fire engine purchased by the city of\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\nThe first “great fire” took place between 10 and 11 o’clock on the night\r\nof April 24, 1730. The fire started in a store along the wharf and\r\nburned several stores under one roof, two cooper shops and an immense\r\nquantity of staves on King Street, and two new tenement houses, all\r\nowned by Mr. Fishbourne; a new house of Mr. Plumstead’s; John\r\nDickinson’s fine new house, and Captain Anthony’s house. Several other\r\nbuildings were damaged and much property fell prey to thieves.\r\n\r\nThis disastrous fire made the whole population realize that new\r\nfire-fighting apparatus was needed. The City Council at once ordered\r\nthree fire engines and 400 leather buckets to be purchased in England\r\nand provided twenty ladders and twenty-five hooks and axes.\r\n\r\nA year elapsed, however, before two of the engines and 250 buckets were\r\nreceived, and Mayor Hassel directed one to be stationed in the yard of\r\nthe Friends’ Meeting House, Second and Market Streets, and the other on\r\nthe lot of Francis Jones, corner Second and Walnut Streets.\r\n\r\nThe old Bickley engine was stationed in the yard of the Baptist Church,\r\non Second near Arch Street. As late as 1771 only six fire engines\r\ncomprised the entire force of the city.\r\n\r\nA third engine was built in Philadelphia by Anthony Nichols, in 1733,\r\nand other buckets were manufactured there. This is the first fire engine\r\never built in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nAt a fire in January, 1733, this engine threw a stream higher than any\r\nother engine had been able to do, but Nichols was not given another\r\norder because his price was too high, he had “used wood instead of brass\r\nand they feared it would not last long.”\r\n\r\nIn December, 1733, there appeared in Franklin’s Pennsylvania Gazette an\r\narticle on fires and their origin, and the mode of putting them out.\r\nAnother article suggested that public pumps should be built, and gave a\r\nplan for the organization of a club or society for putting out fires,\r\nafter the manner of one in Boston.\r\n\r\nFranklin was the author of both articles, and they caused such interest\r\nthat a project of forming such a company was soon undertaken. Thirty\r\njoined the association, and every member was obliged to keep in order\r\nand fit for service a certain number of buckets. They were to meet\r\nmonthly and discuss topics which might be useful in their conduct at\r\nfires.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of the association were so apparent they became so\r\nnumerous as to include quite all the inhabitants who were men of\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nOut of this movement started by Benjamin Franklin was organized the\r\nUnion Fire Company, December 7, 1736, this being the first fire company\r\nin Philadelphia. Among the early members were Franklin, Isaac Paschal,\r\nPhilip Syng, William Rawle and Samuel Powell.\r\n\r\nThe second company was the Fellowship Fire Company, organized March 1,\r\n1738; the third the Hand-in-Hand, organized March 1, 1742; the fourth\r\nthe Heart-in-Hand, organized February 22, 1743; the fifth the\r\nFriendship, organized July 30, 1747; the sixth the Britannia, organized\r\nin 1750.\r\n\r\nRichard Mason in 1768 manufactured engines which were operated by levers\r\nat the ends instead of the side of the engine. These were successful,\r\nand he continued to produce his engines until 1801.\r\n\r\nPatrick Lyon, about 1794, became the greatest fire-engine builder, when\r\nhe invented an engine which would throw more water and with greater\r\nforce than the others. He built fire engines as late as 1824. The\r\n“Reliance” and “Old Diligent,” built by him, performed useful service\r\nuntil the introduction of steam fire engines in 1855.\r\n\r\nThe first truly great fire in Philadelphia occurred July 9, 1850, when\r\n367 houses were destroyed on Delaware Avenue, near Vine Street.\r\n\r\nOn November 12, 1851, three lives were lost in a fire which destroyed\r\nBruner’s cotton factory.\r\n\r\nThe borough of Somerset was almost totally destroyed in 1833, and again\r\non May 9, 1872. In the latter conflagration 117 buildings were\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nOn April 10, 1845, the city of Pittsburgh was visited by its first great\r\nfire, which burned over a space of fifty-six acres of the business and\r\nresidential section.\r\n\r\nDecember 15, 1850, the greater portion of the borough of Carbondale was\r\nwiped out.\r\n\r\nChambersburg suffered first in Stuart’s rebel raid, October 10, 1862,\r\nand again when General McCausland destroyed the beautiful Franklin\r\nCounty seat, July 30, 1864.\r\n\r\nSelinsgrove was visited by a terrible fire February 22, 1872, and\r\nanother fire almost wiped out the town October 30, 1874.\r\n\r\nMifflintown suffered by a great fire in 1871, again on August 23, 1873,\r\nand the borough of Milton was almost destroyed May 14, 1880, when 644\r\nhouses and business blocks were burned from noon until 4 o’clock in the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Washington’s Headquarters in Several Bucks\r\n                     County Mansions Began December\r\n\r\n8, 1776\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the Revolution General Washington established his headquarters in\r\nno less than three of the old-time dwellings of Bucks County.\r\n\r\nWhen Washington crossed the Delaware into Bucks County, Pennsylvania,\r\nwith the rear guard of his army, Sunday, December 8, 1776, he took up\r\nhis quarters in the country house of Mrs. Berkley, while the troops were\r\nstationed opposite the crossing.\r\n\r\nThis dwelling was built in 1750, in the village of Morrisville. The\r\nhouse is still in a fine state of preservation, occupies a commanding\r\nsituation, with a farm of one hundred and sixty-two acres belonging to\r\nit, and is within the site once selected by Congress for the capital of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nIn this house, George Clymer, a signer of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, lived and died. It was then owned by his son, Henry\r\nClymer, afterwards it became the property of the Waddells.\r\n\r\nLocal tradition, seldom at fault in such cases, points this house out as\r\nWashington’s quarters immediately after he crossed the river, and\r\nmementos of the troops have been found in the adjacent fields.\r\n\r\nAfter Washington had placed his troops in position to guard the fords of\r\nthe Delaware and prevent the enemy crossing, the headquarters of the\r\narmy, and the quarters of the commander-in-chief’s most trusted\r\nlieutenants, were fixed at farm houses in the same neighborhood in Upper\r\nWakefield Township, where they were always within easy communication.\r\n\r\nGeneral Washington occupied the dwelling of William Keith, on the road\r\nfrom Brownsburg to the Eagle Tavern; General Green was at Robert\r\nMerrick’s, a few hundred yards away across the fields and meadows;\r\nGeneral Sullivan was at John Hayhurst’s; and Generals Knox and Hamilton\r\nwere at Doctor Chapman’s over Jericho Hill.\r\n\r\nThe troops belonging to the headquarters were encamped in sheltered\r\nplaces along the creeks, and not far removed from the river.\r\n\r\nThis position for headquarters was selected on account of its seclusion,\r\nits nearness to the river and because of its proximity to Jericho\r\nMountain. From the top of this mountain in the winter, signals may be\r\nseen a long distance up and down the river.\r\n\r\nHere, too, Washington was near the fords, at which the enemy would\r\nattempt to cross, if pursuit was intended, and he was also within a half\r\nhour’s ride of Newtown, the depot of supplies.\r\n\r\nThe three old mansions in which Washington, Greene and Knox quartered,\r\nare still standing.\r\n\r\nThe Keith mansion was a two-story, pointed-stone house, twenty-four by\r\ntwenty-eight feet in size, built by William Keith in 1763.\r\n\r\nThe pine door, in two folds, set in a solid oaken frame, is garnished\r\nwith a wooden lock, fourteen by eighteen inches, the same which locked\r\nout intruders when Washington occupied the house. The interior is\r\nfinished in yellow pine. At the time Washington used the dwelling the\r\nyard was inclosed with a stone wall. The property, containing two\r\nhundred and forty acres, and purchased by William Keith, of the London\r\nCompany, December 3, 1761, has never been out of the family.\r\n\r\nThe Merrick house, a quarter of a mile distant to the east, on the road\r\nfrom Newtown to Neely’s Mill, is a pointed-stone dwelling, twenty by\r\ntwenty feet, and kitchen adjoining. It was bought by Samuel Merrick in\r\n1773, and was for many years owned by Edward, a descendant.\r\n\r\nWhen General Greene occupied the dwelling, the first floor was divided\r\ninto three rooms, and the family lived in the log end on the west. As\r\nthe house was not then finished, the General had the walls of the rooms\r\non the ground floor painted in a tasteful manner, with a picture of the\r\nrising sun over the fireplace.\r\n\r\nAt that time Samuel Merrick had a family of half-grown children, who\r\nwere deeply impressed with passing events, and many traditions have been\r\nhanded down to the present generations.\r\n\r\nGeneral Greene purchased the confidence of Hannah, a young daughter, by\r\nthe gift of a small tea canister, which was kept many years in the\r\nfamily. They told how the Rhode Island blacksmith lived on the fat of\r\nthe land while quartered at the house of their ancestor, devouring his\r\nflock of turkeys, and monopolizing the only fresh milk cow, besides\r\neating her calf.\r\n\r\nAt the last supper which General Washington took with General Greene at\r\nthe Merrick house, at which the daughter Hannah waited upon the table,\r\nshe kept the plate from which the commander-in-chief ate as a memento of\r\nthe occasion.\r\n\r\nThe Hayhurst house, where Sullivan quartered, was on the adjoining farm\r\nto Keith’s, where this plain member of the Wrightstown meeting lived\r\nwith his family of five small children.\r\n\r\nThe Chapman mansion, the quarters of General Knox, is on the north side\r\nof the Jericho Mountain, a mile from Brownsburg. It is still in\r\nexcellent condition.\r\n\r\nKnox occupied the first floor of the east end, then divided into two\r\nrooms. Alexander Hamilton, then a youthful captain of artillery, lay\r\nsick in the back room.\r\n\r\nA considerable portion of the Continental army found shelter in this\r\nneighborhood immediately preceding the attack on Trenton, Christmas Day,\r\n1776, and Washington had his headquarters at a quiet farm house in the\r\nshadow of Jericho Hill.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1777, the Continental Army tarried thirteen days on the\r\nNeshaminy Hills, Bucks County, on the York road from Coryell’s Ferry,\r\nnow New Hope, until it received notice of the departure of the British\r\nfleet, which had recently sailed from New York, and which was destined\r\nfor the capture of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nDuring this time Washington was quartered in the stone house not far\r\nfrom the north end of the bridge over the Neshaminy, and on the left\r\nside of the York road going south. It was long since known as the\r\nBothwell home.\r\n\r\nA whipping post was erected on the opposite side of the road.\r\n\r\nWhile Washington was quartered in this house Lafayette reported to him\r\nfor service in the Continental army; and in it was held the first\r\ncouncil of war at which Lafayette had a seat.\r\n\r\nThe army marched hence August 22, through Philadelphia, and then engaged\r\nthe enemy on the field of Brandywine.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Railroad Riots in Erie; Bridges Destroyed\r\n                            December 9, 1853\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting and irritating episodes that became\r\ninterwoven with the administration of Governor James Pollock was what\r\nwas then known as the Erie Riots.\r\n\r\nPollock was seriously handicapped at the outset of his administration by\r\nthe only Know Nothing Legislature in the history of the State. Nothing\r\nconstructive came out of this session, but a movement was begun which\r\nled to the sale of the Main Line of the public works. In this the\r\nGovernor was a strong advocate, and two years later the Legislature\r\npassed the enabling acts by which the Pennsylvania Railroad Company\r\nbecame the purchaser.\r\n\r\nThe Erie and Northwestern Railroad Company had built a short line to\r\nconnect with the New York Central at Buffalo, and with the Lake Shore\r\nLine at Erie, by which a continuous railway line was made to the West.\r\nThe several railroads at that time did not have uniform gauge, and the\r\nroad west of Erie was of a different gauge than those east of that city,\r\nwhich was the most important connecting point; and all passengers and\r\ntraffic were required to be transferred at Erie.\r\n\r\nThe necessities of the growing commerce required that the causes of this\r\ndetention in transfer should be removed, both on account of the delay\r\nand the cost of handling of the freight, and the annoyance to the\r\npassengers in changing cars, all of which was because there was a\r\ndifference of one or two inches in the gauge of the rails of the two\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nThe railroads therefore changed the gauge. This action aroused the\r\nhostility of the people of the city of Erie, whose sympathies the\r\nrailway company seemed to have generally alienated and the battle\r\nprogressed little by little until the entire community became involved\r\nin one of the most disgraceful local conflicts of the history of\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\nOn December 9, 1853, two railroad bridges and many crossings were\r\ndestroyed by a mob of women, and a great parade of the rioters was held\r\namid the shouts of their sympathizers and jeers of their opponents.\r\n\r\nThe people, however, were not all on one side. They were in fact, about\r\nequally divided.\r\n\r\nThe contending forces were popularly known as “Rippers” and “Shanghais.”\r\nThe former term was applied to those who favored the break of the gauge,\r\nas they repeatedly ripped up the tracks of the road.\r\n\r\nThis contest continued for several years and so completely inflamed the\r\nentire community that the prominent citizens became divided on the issue\r\nand ceased all social intercourse. They even carried that feeling so far\r\nthat they would not worship at the same church.\r\n\r\nErie was an important county, and although reliably Whig, all political\r\nties were disregarded and only those could be elected to the Legislature\r\nwho would work for the repeal of the charter of the Erie and\r\nNorthwestern Road.\r\n\r\nAfter a long and bitter conflict the bill transferring the custody of\r\nthe road to the State was passed and approved by Governor Pollock. The\r\ncharter powers passed to the Commonwealth and the road in consequence\r\nwas operated by State authorities.\r\n\r\nThe Governor appointed ex-Congressman Joseph Casey as State\r\nsuperintendent to operate the road. After struggling for a few months in\r\nvain efforts to harmonize the people and to maintain an open line of\r\ncommunication between the East and West, he resigned in disgust.\r\n\r\nGovernor Pollock then appointed General William F. Small, of\r\nPhiladelphia, a veteran of the Mexican War and an experienced member of\r\nthe State Senate, in the expectation that he would be able to calm down\r\nthe belligerents and operate the line. After a few weeks on the job he\r\nresigned. The Governor urged his close friend, Colonel Alexander K.\r\nMcClure, of Philadelphia, but formerly of Chambersburg, to assume the\r\nuninviting task.\r\n\r\nColonel McClure was given full authority to handle the situation as he\r\nthought best. He went to Erie and soon won the confidence of leaders of\r\nboth factions, with many of whom he already had personal acquaintance.\r\n\r\nLined up against the railroad were such men of importance as Judge James\r\nThompson, afterward Chief Justice of the State; State Senator James\r\nSkinner, Mr. Morrow B. Lowrey, later a member of the State Senate, and a\r\nlarge number of men prominent in the business circles of the city.\r\n\r\nOn the other side were men of like distinction, such as John H. Walker,\r\nformer State Senator and president of the last Constitutional\r\nConvention; Senator J. B. Johnson, who was also editor of the\r\nConstitution, one of the leading papers of the city; Milton C.\r\nCourtright, a principal stockholder of the railroad company, and many\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nEach faction entertained Colonel McClure. The city was in distress; even\r\nits population had dwindled to about 5000. Business was at a standstill.\r\nThe only question discussed in the home, shop, store, church or on the\r\nstreet was the railroad issue.\r\n\r\nColonel McClure endeavored to hold conferences with the leaders, but\r\nwhen one faction was willing to attend the other rebelled and vice\r\nversa. Finally he worked out a plan by which it appeared the road could\r\nbe operated without interference.\r\n\r\nColonel McClure started East on a vacation, but only two days later\r\nreceived a dispatch stating that rioting had again broken out afresh,\r\nthat Senator Johnson’s printing office had been destroyed and the\r\nmaterials burned in a bonfire on the street.\r\n\r\nMcClure returned and immediately got into communication with the\r\nleaders. It was learned that the mob spirit was to blame; the leaders\r\nhad endeavored to restrain them, but without avail.\r\n\r\nColonel McClure determined that no further efforts be made to harmonize\r\nthe difficulty but that he would operate the road if it required a\r\nsoldier upon every cross-tie to protect the property, whether the\r\noffenders wore trousers or petticoats.\r\n\r\nTwo leaders of each faction were invited to the Colonel’s room without\r\neither knowing the others were invited. Judge Thompson arrived on the\r\nhour, and soon ex-Senator Walker entered. Walker and Courtright on the\r\none side and Thompson and Skinner on the other had had no social,\r\nbusiness or personal intercourse for more than a year.\r\n\r\nWith unusual diplomacy Colonel McClure induced these leaders to shake\r\nhands and drink a friendly glass with him. Soon the others arrived and\r\nthen before many moments the five were enjoying the genial hospitality\r\nof the colonel and the best supper that Brown’s Hotel could furnish. A\r\ngame of cards was enjoyed until the sun appeared in the morning, when\r\nthey all shook hands, each repaired to his own home and the Erie riots\r\nbecame only a bit of the history of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Count Zinzindorf, Moravian Church\r\n                       Founder, Arrives December\r\n                                10, 1741\r\n\r\n\r\nCount Zinzindorf arrived in Philadelphia December 10, 1741. He was full\r\nof enthusiasm, eager to preach the gospel to all men. His idea was to\r\nunite all Protestant denominations into a Christian confederacy.\r\n\r\nNicholas Ludwig, Count von Zinzindorf, was born at Dresden, Germany, May\r\n26, 1700. In August, 1727, on his estate at Herrnhut (“The Lord’s\r\nKeeping”), in Saxony, he organized some three hundred persons, emigrants\r\nfrom Moravia and Bohemia, into a religious organization known\r\nindiscriminately as “The Church of the Brethren” and “Herrnhutters”—the\r\nforerunner of the United Brethren, or Moravian Church in America.\r\n\r\nIn 1733 this society had become a distinct Church and in 1737,\r\nZinzindorf was consecrated Bishop, and was the “Advocate” of the Church\r\nuntil his death.\r\n\r\nHe came to America to inspect the Moravian establishments in general\r\nhere, and especially to acquaint himself with the fruits of the\r\nBrethren’s labors among the Indians. He certainly did not come to this\r\ncountry with a view of founding Moravian congregations.\r\n\r\nThe nobleman’s activity consisted chiefly in preaching in Philadelphia\r\nand the neighborhood, and holding seven synods or free meetings of all\r\ndenominations, most of them at Germantown, each lasting two or three\r\ndays. These meetings were without practical results, but they surely\r\nserved to awaken a greater interest in religious matters.\r\n\r\nDecember 31, 1741, he appeared for the first time in an American pulpit,\r\npreaching to a large congregation in the German Reformed Church at\r\nGermantown. A few months later the Hon. James Logan wrote to a friend\r\nconcerning Zinzindorf as follows:\r\n\r\n“He speaks Latin and French, is aged I suppose between forty and fifty\r\nyears, wears his own hair and is in all other respects very plain as\r\nmaking the propagation of the gospel his whole purpose and business.”\r\n\r\nZinzindorf’s stay in this country was a period of varied and strenuous\r\nactivity. Few men could have accomplished in the same time what he did.\r\n\r\nDr. Gill, in his “Life of Zinzindorf,” says the Count gave the Indians\r\namong whom he went on his several missionary tours “a practical insight\r\ninto the religion he came to teach by simply leading a Christian life\r\namong them; and, when favorable impressions had thus been made and\r\ninquiry was excited, he preached the leading truths of the gospel,\r\ntaking care not to put more things into their heads than their hearts\r\ncould lay hold of. His mode of approaching them was carefully adapted to\r\ntheir distinctive peculiarities.”\r\n\r\nEarly in the spring of 1741 David Zeisberger and his son David, John\r\nMartin, Mack and some four or five more of the Moravian Brethren, who\r\nhad already established several missions in this country, began a new\r\nmissionary settlement near the “Forks” of the Delaware, on land derived\r\nfrom William Allen, Esq., of Philadelphia, and lying at the confluence\r\nof the Lehigh River and Monacasy Creek, in Buck’s (now Northampton)\r\nCounty.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas Eve of the same year this settlement received the name of\r\n“Bethlehem” from Count Zinzindorf, who had arrived there a few days\r\npreviously. Ever since then Bethlehem has been the headquarters in this\r\ncountry of the Moravian Church, now known as the “Church of the United\r\nBrethren in the United States of America.”\r\n\r\nFrom Bethlehem and other Moravian mission stations the Brethren went out\r\namong the Indians, making converts and establishing new missions. The\r\nIndian wars had hardened the hearts of the New England Puritans against\r\nthe aborigines, and it was left to the Moravians to preach a gentler\r\ncreed to the Indians.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1742, Zinzindorf was called by the Lutherans of Philadelphia to\r\nbe their pastor, but he declined, as he intended to journey to the\r\nIndian country.\r\n\r\nReverend John C. Pyrlaeus, a minister of the Moravian Church, was called\r\nin his stead. There was a strong faction in the Lutheran Church hostile\r\nto the Moravians, and July 9, 1742, Pyrlaeus was forcibly ejected by a\r\ngang of ruffians from the church. Some of the congregation followed him,\r\nand this event led to the erection of the First Moravian Church in\r\nPhiladelphia. Zinzindorf paid for its erection out of his own purse.\r\n\r\nAugust 3, 1742, Count Zinzindorf visited Conrad Weiser at his home, on\r\nTulpehocken, and there met the chief deputies of the Six Nations and\r\nsome other Indians, who had been at the Philadelphia conference, and on\r\ntheir way home were paying Weiser a visit. Among them were Shikellamy\r\nand Canassatego.\r\n\r\nWith those chiefs the Count ratified a covenant of friendship in behalf\r\nof the Brethren, stipulating for permission for the latter to pass to\r\nand from and sojourn within the domains of the Iroquois Confederacy; not\r\nas strangers, but as friends and without suspicion, until such times as\r\nthey should have “mutually learned each other’s peculiarities.”\r\n\r\nIn reply to the speech made by Zinzindorf, Canassatego said: “Brother,\r\nyou have journeyed a long way from beyond the sea in order to preach to\r\nthe white people and the Indians. You did not know we were here (at\r\nTulpehocken). We had no knowledge of your coming. The Great Spirit has\r\nbrought us together. Come to our people; you shall be welcome. Take this\r\nfathom of wampum; it is a token that our words are true.”\r\n\r\nThis “fathom” was composed of 186 white wampums, and was preserved by\r\nthe Brethren for a long time, and was often used in conference with\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nSeptember 24, 1742, Zinzindorf and Weiser set out on horseback for\r\nShamokin and Wyoming. They were also accompanied by the Count’s\r\ndaughter, Benigna, Anna Nitschmann, two Indians and John Martin Mack.\r\n\r\nThe Count kept a journal of his trip which is most interesting. The\r\nlittle company spent several days the guests of the great vicegerent,\r\nShikellamy at Shamokin (now Sunbury), and then proceeded along the West\r\nBranch to what is now Montoursville, where they met the celebrated\r\nMadame Montour and her son, Andrew.\r\n\r\nThe Count and his companions remained with the Montours for four days,\r\nduring which several religious services were held.\r\n\r\nThe party left October 9, under the guidance of Andrew Montour, and at\r\nthe mouth of Warrior Run they took a southeasterly direction, striking\r\nthe North Branch at what is now Bloomsburg, and thence traveled to\r\nWyoming.\r\n\r\nDuring his stay at this place they were several times seriously\r\nthreatened by Indians, and Weiser finally persuaded the missionaries to\r\ndepart, which they did on October 30. Zinzindorf returned to Bethlehem\r\nvia Shamokin, arriving there November 8.\r\n\r\nJanuary 20, 1743, Count Zinzindorf set sail from New York for Dover,\r\nEngland, and never returned to this country. He died at Herrnhut May 9,\r\n1760. He was the author of many sermons, hymns, catechisms and a number\r\nof controversial and devotional works. He published more than 100 works\r\nof prose and verse.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                General Washington Praises Lydia Darrah\r\n                     to Congress December 11, 1777\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the British army held possession of Philadelphia, September 26,\r\n1777, to June 19, 1778, General Howe’s headquarters were in Second\r\nStreet, the fourth door below Spruce, in a house which was before\r\noccupied by General John Cadwallader. Directly opposite resided William\r\nand Lydia Darrah, members of the Society of Friends.\r\n\r\nA superior officer of the British Army, believed to be the adjutant\r\ngeneral, fixed upon one of the chambers in the Darrah home, a back room,\r\nfor holding private conferences, and two or more officers, frequently\r\nmet there, by candle light, and remained long in consultation.\r\n\r\nOn December 2, 1777, the adjutant general told Lydia Darrah that they\r\nwould be in the room at seven o’clock that evening; they would remain\r\nlate, and that he wished the family to retire early to bed, adding that\r\nwhen they were going away they would call her to let them out and to\r\nextinguish their candles and fire.\r\n\r\nShe accordingly sent all the family to bed, but as the high officer had\r\nbeen so particular, her womanly curiosity was excited. She removed her\r\nshoes, and walked quietly to the door, when she placed her ear to the\r\nkeyhole and listened to the conversation of the officers, which was held\r\nin subdued tones. She overheard the reading of an order which was to\r\ncall out all the British troops on the evening of the 4th to attack\r\nGeneral Washington’s army, then encamped at White Marsh.\r\n\r\nOn hearing this news she returned in her chamber and lay down. Soon\r\nafter the officer knocked at the door, but she rose only at the third\r\nsummons, having feigned herself asleep. Her mind was so much agitated\r\nthat she could neither eat nor sleep, supposing it to be in her power to\r\nsave the lives of thousands of her fellow-countrymen, but not knowing\r\nhow she was to convey the information to General Washington, not even\r\ndaring to communicate it to her husband.\r\n\r\nThe time left, however, was short. She must act promptly. She determined\r\nto make her way quickly as possible to the American outposts. In the\r\nearly morning she informed her family that, as she was in need of flour,\r\nshe would go to Frankford for some. Her husband insisted that she take\r\nher maid servant with her, but to his surprise she politely refused.\r\n\r\nShe got access to General Howe and solicited a pass through the British\r\nline, which was readily granted. Leaving her bag at the mill, she\r\nhastened toward the American lines and encountered on her way an\r\nAmerican lieutenant colonel by the name of Craig, of the Light Horse,\r\nwho, with some of his men, was on the lookout for information.\r\n\r\nThe officer recognized Mrs. Darrah as an acquaintance, and inquired\r\nwhere she was going. She answered, in quest of her son, an officer in\r\nthe American Army, and prayed that the colonel might alight and walk\r\nwith her. He did so, ordering his troops to keep in sight.\r\n\r\nTo Colonel Craig she disclosed her secret after having obtained from him\r\na solemn promise never to betray her individually, as her life might be\r\nat stake with the British.\r\n\r\nThe colonel conducted her to a house near at hand, directed something be\r\ngiven her to eat, and he then hastened with all possible speed to\r\nheadquarters, where he immediately acquainted General Washington with\r\nwhat he had heard.\r\n\r\nWashington put in motion every possible preparation to baffle the\r\nmeditated surprise.\r\n\r\nMrs. Darrah obtained her flour and returned home; sat up alone to watch\r\nthe movement of the British troops, heard their footsteps as they\r\nsilently marched away; but when they returned a few days after, she did\r\nnot dare to ask a question, though solicitous to learn of the event.\r\n\r\nThe following evening the adjutant general came to the house and\r\nrequested Mrs. Darrah to walk up to his room, as he wished to put some\r\nquestions to her.\r\n\r\nShe followed him in terror; and when he locked the door and begged her,\r\nwith an air of mystery, to be seated, she was sure that she was either\r\nsuspected or betrayed.\r\n\r\nHe inquired earnestly whether any of her family was up the last night\r\nwhen he and the other officers met. She assured him that they all\r\nretired at 8 o’clock. He then observed:\r\n\r\n“I know you were asleep, for I knocked at your chamber door three times\r\nbefore you heard me. I am entirely at a loss to imagine who gave General\r\nWashington information of our intended attack, unless the walls of the\r\nhouse could speak. When we arrived near White Marsh we found all their\r\ncannon mounted and the troops prepared to receive us, and we have\r\nmarched back like a parcel of fools.”\r\n\r\nAmong the published correspondence of General Washington is a letter\r\nwritten by him, addressed Headquarters, Whitemarsh, 10 December, 1777,\r\nwhich is as follows:\r\n\r\n“Sir—I have the honor to inform you that in the course of last week,\r\nfrom a variety of intelligence, I had reason to expect that General Howe\r\nwas preparing to give us a general action. Accordingly, on Thursday\r\nnight he moved from the city with all his force, except a very\r\ninconsiderable part left in his lines and redoubts, and appeared the\r\nnext morning on Chestnut Hill, in front of, and about three miles\r\ndistant from, our right wing.\r\n\r\n“As soon as our position was discovered, the Pennsylvania militia were\r\nordered from our right, to skirmish with their light advanced parties;\r\nand I am sorry to mention, that Brigadier General Irvine, who led them\r\non, had the misfortune to be wounded and to be taken prisoner. Nothing\r\nmore occurred on that day.\r\n\r\n“On Friday night the enemy changed their ground, and moved to our left\r\nwithin a mile of our line, where they remained quiet and advantageously\r\nposted the whole of the next day.\r\n\r\n“On Sunday they inclined still further to our left; and, from every\r\nappearance there was reason to apprehend they were determined on an\r\naction. In this movement their advanced and flanking parties were warmly\r\nattacked by Colonel Morgan and his corps and also by the Maryland\r\nmilitia under Colonel Gist. Their loss I cannot ascertain; but I am\r\ninformed it was considerable.\r\n\r\n“On Monday afternoon they began to move again, and instead of advancing,\r\nfiled off from their right; and the first certain account that I could\r\nobtain of their intentions was, that they were in full march toward\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\n“The enemy’s loss, as I have observed, I cannot ascertain. One account\r\nfrom the city is that 500 wounded had been sent in; another is that\r\neighty-two wagons had gone in with men in this situation. These, I fear,\r\nare both exaggerated, and not to be depended upon. We lost twenty-seven\r\nmen in Morgan’s corps, killed and wounded, besides Major Morris, a brave\r\nand gallant officer, who is among the latter.”\r\n\r\nIn a second letter to Congress, dated Headquarters near the Guelph, 11,\r\nDecember, 1777, General Washington referred to the bravery of a\r\nPennsylvanian as being the means of saving the army. There is hardly a\r\ndoubt but that he had in mind the brave action of Lydia Darrah, one of\r\nthe heroines of our country.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Federal Constitution Adopted by Pennsylvania\r\n                           December 12, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nThe establishment of a free nation resulted through the close of the war\r\nof independence, yet it also brought anxious solicitude to every\r\npatriot’s mind, and this state of apprehension increased with each\r\nsucceeding year.\r\n\r\nThe State debts operated severely on all classes, to meet the payment of\r\nwhich was impossible. This and kindred troubles, financial and\r\ngovernmental, impressed the people with the gloomy conviction that the\r\ngreat work of independence was only half done. It was felt that above\r\nall things a definite and organic form of government—reflecting the will\r\nof the people—should be fixed upon, to give energy to national power and\r\nsuccess to individual and public enterprise.\r\n\r\nSo portentous a crisis as this formed another epoch for the display of\r\nthe intellectual and political attainments of American statesmen, and\r\nthe ordeal was one through which they passed with the highest honor and\r\nwith ever-enduring fame at home and abroad.\r\n\r\nA change was now to be wrought. The same hall which had resounded with\r\nwords of patriotic defiance that shook the throne of King George III and\r\nproclaimed to an astonished world the Declaration of Independence, that\r\nsame hall in which the Congress had continued to sit during the greater\r\npart of that war, the State House in Philadelphia, was soon to witness\r\nthe assembling of such a body of men as in point of intellectual talent,\r\npersonal integrity and lofty purpose had perhaps never before been\r\nbrought together.\r\n\r\nOn the proposition of uniting the water of the Ohio and Potomac Rivers\r\ndeputies from five States met at Annapolis in September, 1786. Their\r\npowers were too limited, and nothing was accomplished. This meeting was\r\nnot, however, without its beneficial effect, for there were assembled\r\nmen who deeply felt the depressed and distracted condition of the\r\ncountry, and put their sentiments into action.\r\n\r\nThey drew up a report and an address to all the States strongly\r\nrepresenting the inefficiency of the present Federal Government, and\r\nearnestly urging them to send delegates to meet in Philadelphia in May,\r\n1787. Congress responded to this proceeding in February by adopting\r\nresolutions recommending the proposed measure.\r\n\r\nOn the day appointed for the meeting, May 14, 1787, only a small number\r\nof delegates had arrived in Philadelphia. The deliberations did not\r\ncommence, therefore, until May 25, when there were present twenty-nine\r\nmembers representing nine States. Others soon arrived, until there were\r\nfifty-five to respond to their names. Never, perhaps, had any body of\r\nmen combined for so great a purpose, to form a constitution which was to\r\nrule a great people for many generations.\r\n\r\nWashington was the outstanding figure, and then the idol of the whole\r\npeople. And there was Rufus King, Gerry and Strong, of Massachusetts;\r\nLangdon, of New Hampshire; Ellsworth and Sherman, of Connecticut;\r\nHamilton, of New York; Livingston and Dickinson, of New Jersey;\r\nRandolph, Wythe and Madison, of Virginia; Martin, of Maryland; Davies,\r\nof North Carolina; Rutledge and Pickens, of South Carolina.\r\n\r\nFrom our own great Commonwealth were Franklin, one of the profoundest\r\nphilosophers in the world, and, though nearly fourscore years of age,\r\nwas able to grasp and throw light upon the complex problems relating to\r\nthe science of government; Robert Morris, the great financier, of whom\r\nit has been truthfully said, that “Americans owed, and still owe, as\r\nmuch acknowledgment to the financial operations of Robert Morris, as to\r\nthe negotiations of Benjamin Franklin, or even to the arms of George\r\nWashington.” Gouverneur Morris conspicuous for his accomplishments in\r\nlearning, his fluent conversation, and sterling abilities in debate;\r\nGeorge Clymer, distinguished among Pennsylvanians as one of the first to\r\nraise a defiant voice against the aribitrary acts of the mother country;\r\nThomas Mifflin, ardent almost beyond discretion, in zeal for his\r\ncountry’s rights and liberties; James Wilson, the most distinguished\r\nlawyer in that body, and Jared Ingersoll, another of the great lawyers\r\nof that day.\r\n\r\nWhen the convention proceeded to organize, Robert Morris nominated\r\nGeneral Washington to preside, and he was unanimously elected. Standing\r\nrules were adopted, one of which was that nothing spoken during the\r\ndeliberations be printed or otherwise published or made known in any\r\nmanner without special permission.\r\n\r\nThe delegates to the convention had been appointed merely with a view to\r\nthe revision or improvement of the old Articles of Confederation, which\r\nstill held the States together as a Nation.\r\n\r\nMr. Randolph, of Virginia, in opening the great discussion, laid bare\r\nthe defects of the Articles of Confederation, and then submitted a\r\nseries of resolutions embodying the substance of a plan of government,\r\nsimilar to that suggested in letters of Washington, Madison and\r\nJefferson a few months previous.\r\n\r\nThe plan in question proposed the formation of a general government,\r\nconstituted as follows: The national legislature to consist of two\r\nbranches, the members of the first branch to be elected by the people of\r\nthe several States, and the members of the second branch to be elected\r\nby the first branch; a national chief executive to be chosen by the\r\nnational legislature; and a national judiciary. Provision also was made\r\nfor the admission of new states into the Union.\r\n\r\nMr. Randolph’s plan had many supporters, but other projects were brought\r\nforward, which occasioned angry debates for some days, and but for the\r\ntimely and healing wisdom of Dr. Franklin, the mentor of the\r\nConstitution, might have broken up the body.\r\n\r\nThe debate closed September 17, and the result of the convention’s\r\nlabors was the formation of a constitution establishing a national\r\ngovernment on the principles that the affairs of the people of the\r\nUnited States were thenceforth to be administered not by a confederacy\r\nor mere league of friendship between the Sovereign States, but by a\r\ngovernment, distributed into three great departments—legislative,\r\njudicial and executive.\r\n\r\nThe final draft of the Constitution was signed by all members present\r\nexcept Randolph and Mason, of Virginia and Gerry, of Massachusetts.\r\nWashington signed first, and as he stood, pen in hand, said: “Should the\r\nStates reject this excellent Constitution, the probability is that an\r\nopportunity will never again be offered to cancel another in peace—the\r\nnext will be drawn in blood.” The other members solemnly signed the\r\nhistoric document.\r\n\r\nThe convention, however, was not clothed with legislative power, nor was\r\nthe Continental Congress, competent to accept or reject it. It was\r\nreferred to the several States to be the law of the Nation when ratified\r\nby nine of the States.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the summer of 1788 that ratification of the nine States\r\nwas obtained, beginning with Delaware, December 7, 1787, closely\r\nfollowed by Pennsylvania, five days later, December 12, 1787, some by\r\nlarge and some by very small majorities.\r\n\r\nIn New York the opposition resulted in serious riots. Of the thirteen\r\noriginal states, Rhode Island was the last to accept the Constitution,\r\nwhich she did in May, 1790.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Attempt to Impeach Justices Yeates, Shippen\r\n                   and Smith Fails, December 13, 1803\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas McKean became Governor of Pennsylvania December 17, 1799.\r\n\r\nWith the election of McKean there was at once a lively commotion\r\nconcerning the disposition of offices, and for the first time in the\r\nhistory of the State the Governor found himself confronted with this new\r\nand perplexing problem.\r\n\r\nThere never had been any radical change in the offices during the long\r\nperiod of the Provincial Government, while the party of the Revolution,\r\nafter the war, with the single exception of Dickinson’s term, had been\r\nin power until this time. But now the political ax was to be swung.\r\nMcKean knew how to swing it and the work suited his strong nature. His\r\ncourse was sharply criticized, and party feeling during his entire\r\nadministration was exceedingly warm and bitter.\r\n\r\nThe Federalists in the Legislature made an attack upon the Governor for\r\nholding the principles he enunciated, and the address of the Senate was\r\none of accusation instead of congratulation.\r\n\r\nGovernor McKean made a long reply, declaring that the objectionable\r\nexpressions were uttered before he assumed office, and that as regards\r\nthe removals from office he relied upon his right to make such changes\r\nas he deemed proper, without accountability to any person or party.\r\n\r\nIn the address of the Democratic nominee for 1803 is used the following\r\nlanguage: “As Pennsylvania is the keystone of the Democratic arch, every\r\nengine will be used to sever it from its place”—being probably the first\r\ninstance in which the comparison of the Commonwealth to the keystone of\r\nan arch was used, and the origin of a figure of speech since very\r\ncommon.\r\n\r\nDuring the session of the Legislature, December 13, 1803, a memorial was\r\npresented from Thomas Passmore, of Philadelphia, charging Justices\r\nJasper Yeates, Edward Shippen and Thomas Smith of the Supreme Court of\r\nPennsylvania, with oppression and false imprisonment, the complainant\r\nhaving been committed for contempt of court.\r\n\r\nThe matter was considered in General Assembly and the House recommended\r\nthat the court be impeached for high misdemeanors. Articles of complaint\r\nwere prepared and the impeachment sent to the Senate. It was not until\r\nthe subsequent session that proceedings were had when upon the final\r\nvote in the Senate, 13 voted guilty and 11 not guilty. The\r\nconstitutional majority of two-thirds not being obtained the accused\r\nwere acquitted.\r\n\r\nIn this proceeding the chief point in connection was the extent to which\r\nthe common law of England was applicable or in force in Pennsylvania;\r\nwhether the justices had exceeded their authority in construing its\r\nprovisions and harmonizing them with the statutes then in force, and\r\nalso with peculiar exigencies of the case out of which the impeachment\r\nhad grown.\r\n\r\nAs an element of State history the affair of the impeachment of the\r\njustices was of minor importance. In its relation to the jurisprudence\r\nof the Commonwealth, it was a subject of great moment, and was discussed\r\nand commented upon in all the populous States of the country, as the\r\nbeginning of a movement to set aside the strict teachings of English\r\ncommon law and to establish precedents applicable to our own necessities\r\nwithout especial regard to those which originally had been imported from\r\nthe Mother Country.\r\n\r\nThe time had come when an independent judicial system in this State was\r\nmade necessary, and this was one of the beginnings.\r\n\r\nIt can hardly be questioned but that partisan politics played some part\r\nin the impeachment proceedings, as Justices Yeates, Shippen and Smith\r\nbelonged to the Federalist Party, and their impeachment would have made\r\nthree fine places for their opponents. It was ever thus.\r\n\r\nA movement was started in 1805 by a faction of the Democratic Party for\r\nrevision of the Constitution. It grew out of the impeachment\r\nproceedings, and the advocates of the measure proposed to make the\r\nelection of Senators annual, to reduce the patronage of the Governor and\r\nto limit the tenure of the judiciary.\r\n\r\nThis new party assumed the name of “Constitutionalists,” while those\r\nopposed styled themselves “Friends of the People.” The controversy for\r\nsome reason was carried on with much bitterness.\r\n\r\nGovernor McKean strongly opposed another constitutional convention, and\r\nin a message expressed his views as follows:\r\n\r\n“The organization of the judicial power of Pennsylvania has been long\r\nand fairly condemned. But there is not a defect suggested from any\r\nquarter which the Legislature is not competent to remedy. The authority\r\nof the Judges may be restricted or enlarged. The law they dispense,\r\nwhether statute law or common law, may be annulled or modified. The\r\ndelay of justice may be obviated by increasing the number of judges in\r\nproportion to the obvious increase of judicial business or by\r\ninstituting local tribunals, where local cases demand a more constant\r\nexercise of jurisdiction.”\r\n\r\nAlthough the constitutional convention was not held, the proposition\r\nfound many supporters in all parties. Under the changed conditions\r\nMcKean’s friends knew that Editor Duane’s influence would seek to defeat\r\nhis renomination for Governor if possible. The nomination for Governor\r\nwas then made by a legislative caucus.\r\n\r\nThe legislative nominating caucus at Lancaster dissolved in confusion.\r\nSome were for McKean, while others equally enthusiastic were for Simon\r\nSnyder, the speaker of the House. The “Freeman’s Journal” characterized\r\nSnyder as a “Pennsylvania Dutchman” and intimated that even Duane in the\r\n“Aurora” did not give him a very hearty support. The campaign was\r\nspirited. Numerous societies were formed and addresses in German\r\nbroadcast.\r\n\r\nGovernor McKean was elected by 5601 majority and once more found himself\r\nsupported by those from whom he had broken away only a few years before.\r\nThe Constitutionalists soon disappeared from the political stage.\r\n\r\nThe re-election of the Governor was not without its losses, however, for\r\nsoon afterward he became involved in libel suits with Duane, Dr. Leib\r\nand others, while they in the spirit of retaliation presented the\r\nGovernor for impeachment on charges of abuse of the executive power.\r\n\r\nThe impeachment proceedings were hardly more than a revival of the old\r\npolitical troubles in which envy and jealousy played the leading roles.\r\nThe committee of the House investigated the charges and reported to the\r\nHouse, when a vote was taken which resulted in a tie. The division was\r\nstrictly on party lines, and the matter was therefore indefinitely\r\npostponed. The Governor’s reputation was in no wise injured in the\r\nunfortunate action.\r\n\r\nThe Governor, in a message to the General Assembly, reminded the members\r\nthat “libeling had become the crying sin of the Nation and the times.”\r\nHe strongly denounced a condition which permitted the prostitution of\r\nthe liberty of the press, the overwhelming torrent of political\r\ndissension, the indiscriminate demolition of public characters, and the\r\nbarbarous inroads upon the peace and happiness of individuals, etc.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                John Binns and Samuel Stewart Fight Last\r\n                     Duel in Pennsylvania December\r\n                                14, 1805\r\n\r\n\r\nDueling was prohibited by an act of Assembly in Pennsylvania March 31,\r\n1806, and it is a fact that the passage of this prohibitory measure was\r\ndue wholly, or in a great degree, to a duel which had occurred between\r\nJohn Binns and Samuel Stewart December 14, 1805.\r\n\r\nThe prominence of the antagonists had much to do with the public feeling\r\nwhich followed this affair.\r\n\r\nBinns was the owner and editor of the Republican Argus, of\r\nNorthumberland, the most influential newspaper published at that time in\r\nthe State save the Aurora, of Philadelphia, and Binns was the agency\r\nwhich, a few years later, drove that paper out of publication.\r\n\r\nSamuel Stewart was a resident of Williamsport, where he enjoyed a wide\r\npolitical influence, which made him the object of attack in the\r\nopposition newspapers.\r\n\r\nJohn Binns in his autobiography says: “On Saturday, November 2, 1805,\r\nwhile I was in the public ball alley, in Sunbury, with a yellow pine bat\r\nin my right hand, tossing a ball against a wall, waiting for Major\r\nCharles Maclay to play a game, a very tall, stout stranger came to me\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n“‘My name is Sam Stewart, of Lycoming County; your name, I understand,\r\nis John Binns, and that you are the editor of the Republican Argus.’ I\r\nanswered: ‘You have been correctly informed,’ ‘I wish,’ said he, ‘to\r\nknow who is the author of the letters published in that paper signed\r\n“One of the People.”' ‘For what purpose?’ said I. ‘Because,’ said he,\r\n‘there are some remarks in one of them which reflect upon my character,\r\nand I must know the author.’\r\n\r\n“With this demand I declined to reply, but said: ‘If there be anything\r\nin them untrue it shall be corrected.’ Stewart, who was standing at my\r\nright side, instantly threw his left arm across my breast and with it\r\nheld both my arms tight above the elbows and at the same time threw his\r\nright arm across the back of my head, violently pushing the end of his\r\nforefinger into the corner of my right eye, evidently with intent to\r\ntear it out of my head.\r\n\r\n“Upon the instant I struck him, with all the strength I could command,\r\nover the shin with the edge of the yellow pine bat, which I fortunately\r\nhad in my right hand. This severe blow made Stewart instantly snatch his\r\nfinger from my eye, and seizing me around the waist with both arms\r\nlifted me from the ground and endeavored to throw me down.\r\n\r\n“This attack and struggle took place in the ball alley of Henry\r\nSchaffer, into whose hotel I went and wrote a note, which was handed to\r\nMr. Stewart forthwith by Major Maclay, Sunbury, November 2, 1805. ‘After\r\nthreatening me like a bravo, you have attacked me like a ruffian. Some\r\nsatisfaction ought to be rendered for such conduct. If you have the\r\nspirit and the courage to meet me as a gentleman, and will appoint time\r\nand place and meet me with pistols, accompanied by a friend, what has\r\npassed shall be overlooked by John Binns.’\r\n\r\n“To this note Mr. Stewart returned a verbal answer, by Major Maclay,\r\nthat he was going to the city, but would be back in two or three weeks,\r\nwhen he would acquaint Mr. Binns of his arrival and give him time to\r\nsend to Buffalo (Union County) for Major Maclay, who, he presumed, would\r\nattend Mr. Binns as his friend on the occasion.\r\n\r\n“On the day of its date I received a note, of which the following is a\r\ncopy, from Andrew Kennedy, the printer of the Northumberland Gazette,\r\nwho informed me Mr. Stewart was at his house, and requested that any\r\nanswer I thought proper to send should be sent there.\r\n\r\n“‘Northumberland, Dec. 13, 1805.\r\n\r\n“‘When I received your challenge I was at that time on my way to the\r\ncity, and had it not in my power to meet you, but now I am here, ready\r\nto see you. You will therefore, mention the time and place, and you will\r\nhave it in your power to try my spirits that you so much doubted; it\r\nmust be immediately; let me hear from you.'\r\n\r\n“To this note I forthwith returned the following answer:\r\n\r\n“‘Yours I have just received. You are aware that my friend Major Maclay\r\nis to attend me; so soon as he arrives, I shall be ready; I shall send\r\nfor him immediately, and expect he will lose no time in coming to\r\nNorthumberland, in which case I presume every necessary arrangement can\r\nbe made between him and your friend this evening and we can meet\r\ntomorrow morning.’\r\n\r\n“Immediately after writing the above note, I wrapped a pair of pistols\r\nin my great-coat pocket and walked about half a mile to the house of\r\nWilliam Bonham, where I had directed that my horse, and any answer sent\r\nto my note, should be forwarded. While waiting at Bonham’s, Major Maclay\r\narrived. I made him a statement of all that had passed between Stewart\r\nand myself, put him in full possession of my opinion and wishes, and he\r\nwent to Northumberland to settle the time and place.\r\n\r\n“On Maclay’s return, he informed me that the meeting was to be at 7\r\no’clock the next morning behind Lawshe’s house, opposite Derrstown,\r\nwhere we agreed to sleep that night.\r\n\r\n“We were on the ground at 7 o’clock just at the gray of the morning. In\r\na few minutes, we saw Stewart and Kennedy coming down the lane. After\r\nmutual salutations, Maclay and Kennedy then retired and after some\r\nconversation, stepped eight paces and placed Stewart and myself at the\r\nextreme ends of the line. Maclay then said: ‘Gentlemen, it is agreed\r\nbetween Kennedy and myself, that if either of the parties shall leave\r\nhis ground until the affair is finally settled, such party shall be\r\nregarded as disgraced.’\r\n\r\n“The seconds then tossed up to determine which of whom should give the\r\nword. Maclay won. The pistols were presented and discharged so\r\nsimultaneously that but one report was heard. Neither of the balls took\r\neffect. Maclay then addressed Kennedy and said, ‘You had better consult\r\nyour principal, and I will do the same.’ Maclay’s first words to Binns\r\nwere, ‘Kennedy is a scoundrel. He is determined, if he can, to have you\r\nshot.’ Binns said, ‘Very well, you know the terms agreed upon and we\r\nwill carry them out.’\r\n\r\n“Mr. Maclay came between the antagonists and said, 'Gentlemen, I think\r\nthis business has gone far enough and may be amicably and honorably\r\nadjusted. To effect this I propose that Mr. Stewart shall apologize for\r\nthe attack he made upon Mr. Binns, and then Mr. Binns declare that the\r\npublication which gave offense to Mr. Stewart was not made from any wish\r\nto wound the feelings or injuriously affect the character of Mr.\r\nStewart, but because Mr. Binns believed it to be true and that it was a\r\nmatter proper for public publication.’”\r\n\r\nAfter a pause Mr. Stewart made the required apology and Binns made the\r\ndeclaration which his friend proposed.\r\n\r\nThe matter being thus satisfactorily arranged, the parties shook hands\r\nand at a tavern in the neighborhood they and their friends breakfasted\r\ntogether. Stewart and Binns continued friends.\r\n\r\nStewart was elected to the Assembly from Lycoming County by the Federal\r\nParty and every year voted for John Binns, then editor of the Democratic\r\nPress, of Philadelphia, as a director of the Pennsylvania Bank.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Pennsylvania Troops Mustered for Mexican\r\n                         War, December 15, 1846\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the second year of Governor Francis R. Shunk’s administration the\r\nwar with Mexico was begun. Pennsylvania was authorized to furnish six\r\nregiments of infantry. Two were mustered into the service, the first on\r\nDecember 15, 1846, at Pittsburgh, under command of Colonel Wynkoop, the\r\nsecond on January 5, 1847, also at Pittsburgh, under command of Colonel\r\nRoberts, who was succeeded by Colonel Geary.\r\n\r\nThe gallant services of the troops on the fields of Mexico at Vera Cruz,\r\nCerro Gordo, Chepultepec and the City of Mexico, their bravery and\r\nvalor, secured the highest commendation of their venerated chieftain.\r\n\r\nDuring Governor Shunk’s administration the economic condition of the\r\nState was greatly improved. The financial storm was passed and men were\r\nrecovering from their reverses. Banks were clamoring for charters, but\r\nthe Governor limited the number and refused to sponsor the establishment\r\nof a system of free banking, such as was in operation in several States.\r\n\r\nIt was during Governor Shunk’s term that the Legislature enacted the\r\nfirst law extending to women the rights of property. There also was a\r\nchange made in the law relating to the separation of married persons.\r\n\r\nIn 1847, Governor Shunk was re-elected for a second term. Early in the\r\nyear 1848 he was attacked with a pulmonary trouble which soon assumed a\r\nserious character. Just as the remnants of our brave and heroic troops\r\nwere returning from the battlefields of Mexico with their laurels,\r\nGovernor Shunk suffered a severe hemorrhage of the lungs, on the morning\r\nof July 9. On that day, feeling that his days were numbered, the\r\nGovernor wrote a letter of resignation to the people of Pennsylvania and\r\na few days later, July 20, 1848, died. His body was laid to rest in the\r\nold Lutheran burying ground at the Trappe.\r\n\r\nGovernor Shunk was succeeded by William Freame Johnston, the Speaker of\r\nthe Senate, according to the provisions of the Constitution, the vacancy\r\noccurring three months before the general election. The Acting Governor\r\nissued the necessary writs for the election of a Chief Magistrate, which\r\nresulted in the election of Senator Johnston. The new Governor was a\r\nnative of Greensburg, Westmoreland County.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the Legislature having been called to the neglected and\r\nsuffering condition of the insane poor of the State, in 1844, there was\r\nprovision made for the establishment of an asylum to be located within\r\nten miles of the seat of Government. The citizens of Harrisburg, with\r\nthe aid of a liberal appropriation by Dauphin County, purchased a farm\r\nadjoining that city, and in 1848, the commissioners appointed by the\r\nState began the construction of the first building erected by the\r\nCommonwealth for the reception and care of the indigent insane.\r\n\r\nThe Fugitive Slave Law was passed by Congress during Governor Johnston’s\r\nadministration, and the excitement incident to the return of fugitives\r\nunder it, soon became a subject of heated discussion. In 1851 a serious\r\nriot occurred at Christiana, Lancaster County, and in other localities\r\nthe arrest of fugitive slaves led to bloodshed.\r\n\r\nUnder the administration of Governor Johnston, the records of the\r\nProvincial and State Government, which had remained in single manuscript\r\ncopy in a very confused condition, were preserved.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the Governor’s recommendation, an act was passed\r\nauthorizing the appointment of a suitable agent to select and\r\nsuperintend their publication. Samuel Hazard, of Philadelphia, was\r\ndelegated, and under his supervision twenty-eight volumes of colonial\r\nrecords and Pennsylvania archives, containing a vast amount of original\r\npapers of incalculable value and interest were published.\r\n\r\nThey form almost complete details of the transactions of Government from\r\n1682 to 1790, invaluable in their importance to a full comprehension of\r\nthe early history of Pennsylvania. The work has been continued and only\r\nrecently the seventh series of the Archives appeared.\r\n\r\nIn 1849 considerable excitement existed in Pittsburgh and in the western\r\npart of the State, occasioned by the erection of a bridge over the Ohio\r\nRiver at Wheeling, W. Va., which obstructed the river to navigation in\r\ntime of high water. Appeals for relief were made to the Legislature, and\r\nto Congress, and finally to the Supreme Court of the United States.\r\nMeasures, however, were adopted which removed all objections.\r\n\r\nGovernor Johnston was renominated for a second term. His Democratic\r\nopponent was William Bigler, of Clearfield. The campaign was unusually\r\nspirited and was carried on vigorously from midsummer until the day of\r\nthe election in October. State questions were forgotten, the Fugitive\r\nSlave law and slavery in the Territories now demanded universal\r\nattention. Bigler was elected by a good majority, and was inaugurated\r\nJanuary 20, 1852.\r\n\r\nBy a remarkable coincidence his own election as Governor of Pennsylvania\r\nwas simultaneous with the election of his elder brother, John, also a\r\nnative of Pennsylvania, to the same dignity in the new State of\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nGovernor Bigler’s Administration is marked with stronger features than\r\nany one of his immediate predecessors. Several very important measures\r\nwere adopted by the Legislature, the principle of which were the\r\nestablishing of the office of the County Superintendent of Common\r\nSchools and the founding of the Pennsylvania Training School for\r\nFeeble-Minded Children.\r\n\r\nThe completion of the Pennsylvania Railroad from Harrisburg to\r\nPittsburgh in February, 1854, added a powerful impulse to the\r\ndevelopment of the resources of the State.\r\n\r\nThe County of Philadelphia was merged with the city February 2, 1854, a\r\nmeasure of great importance, as it enlarged the sphere of municipal\r\naction.\r\n\r\nGovernor Bigler urged the payment of the public debt, and used his great\r\ninfluence in behalf of the public schools with beneficent results.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1854, Bigler was unanimously nominated for a second term and\r\nimmediately entered upon another hard campaign for re-election. Opposed\r\nto him was James Pollock, of Milton, a man of rare culture and ability.\r\nIn the midst of the campaign Governor Bigler was stricken down with\r\nsickness, and he lay ill at his home in Clearfield during most of the\r\ncanvass, thus being unable to stir up his followers by his personal\r\npresence and earnestness. Pollock’s campaign was allied with the Native\r\nAmerican or Know-Nothing Party. He also was an active leader in the Free\r\nSoil movement. Bigler had violently opposed the Know-Nothing Party from\r\nits first organization, and his attitude toward the Kansas-Nebraska Bill\r\ncost him many votes. As a result Pollock was elected Governor by a large\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               General U. S. Grant Leaves Philadelphia on\r\n                  Trip Around World, Arriving There on\r\n                        Return December 16, 1879\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were several incidents in life of General Ulysses Simpson Grant\r\nwhich are of especial interest to Pennsylvanians.\r\n\r\nOn June 10, 1865, he was tendered a formal reception at the Union League\r\nClub house in Philadelphia, at which he was received with such\r\nenthusiasm, the general was engaged more than three hours in shaking\r\nhands with his visitors.\r\n\r\nWhen the great fair was held at the Academy of Music, commencing October\r\n23, 1865, to aid the Soldiers and Sailors’ Home, the inauguration\r\nceremonies were conducted by Lieutenant-General Grant, Major General\r\nMeade, and Admiral Farragut, and an executive committee, including the\r\nmost distinguished officers and civilians.\r\n\r\nAs these three most distinguished officers appeared together, the entire\r\naudience rose and saluted them with long continued applause. They each\r\nmade short addresses.\r\n\r\nAugust 14, 1866, General Grant accompanied President Johnson and other\r\ndistinguished citizens to Philadelphia, where they were received by a\r\ngreat procession of militia and firemen.\r\n\r\nThe burial of General George G. Meade at Laurel Hill, Philadelphia,\r\nNovember 11, 1872, was the occasion of much mourning.\r\n\r\nGeneral Meade was the one conspicuous Philadelphian who stood out above\r\nall other Pennsylvanians in the Civil War, and in the years after the\r\nRebellion he was an object of admiration to all the people. His death\r\nwas regarded as a genuine public loss, and his funeral was attended with\r\nmost impressive ceremonies.\r\n\r\nThe procession contained many of the greatest soldiers and civilians in\r\nthe country, chiefest among whom was General Grant, President of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nOn December 18, 1875, President Grant, members of his cabinet and a\r\nlarge number of senators and representatives in Congress made a trip to\r\nPhiladelphia to inspect the Centennial buildings, then nearly completed.\r\nThey were entertained at a sumptuous banquet in Horticultural Hall, at\r\nwhich President Grant delivered the principal address.\r\n\r\nPresident Grant was the guest of honor at the opening of the great\r\nexhibition, May 10, 1876, when simple but appropriate exercises were\r\nheld. Four thousand soldiers escorted the President to the grounds. One\r\nhundred and fifty thousand people acclaimed the President and the\r\nCentennial Exposition.\r\n\r\nOn May 15, 1877, ex-President Grant started on his memorable trip around\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nHe sailed from the port of Philadelphia in the ship “Indiana.” His\r\ndeparture attracted much attention, and on the day previous he had held\r\na public reception in Independence Hall.\r\n\r\nHe was accompanied down the Delaware River on the steamboat “Twilight”\r\nby a crowd of distinguished citizens, among whom were General Sherman,\r\nSenator Zachariah Chandler, Senator Simon Cameron, and others prominent\r\nin State and Nation.\r\n\r\nHe was accompanied by his wife and one son, and they made a tour of the\r\nwhole civilized world, visiting especially the great countries of Europe\r\nand Asia, and receiving, as a soldier and civilian and the first citizen\r\nof the United States, all the honor which rulers and people could\r\nbestow. As the unofficial representative of his country, his bearing was\r\nsuch as to win universal admiration and respect.\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived in the Mersey River, England, the ships of all nations\r\ngathered there displayed their flags to greet him.\r\n\r\nIn England a grand reception was accorded him in every city he visited.\r\nHe was received by Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales in London, and\r\nlater visited the Queen in Windsor Castle.\r\n\r\nAfter visiting the other countries of Europe and being entertained by\r\nall the crowned heads, the United States man-of-war “Vandalia” was\r\nplaced at his service and on board her he made a cruise of the\r\nMediterranean Sea.\r\n\r\nHe then visited Bombay and Calcutta in India, Hong Kong, Canton and\r\nPeking in China, and finally Japan.\r\n\r\nOn September 20, 1879, he arrived at San Francisco, where a magnificent\r\ndemonstration was made in his honor, and during his route East, across\r\nthe United States, he was given public receptions and greeted with every\r\nmark of honor wherever he stopped.\r\n\r\nHis circuit around the world was accomplished in two years and seven\r\nmonths, and when he arrived back in Philadelphia, December 16, 1879, on\r\nthe Pennsylvania Railroad, a great procession awaited him. All business\r\nwas suspended by general consent.\r\n\r\nThe decorations along the route of the parade were unprecedented in\r\nnumber, variety and costliness.\r\n\r\nThe procession under the marshalship of Colonel A. Loudon Snowden, took\r\nnearly half the day in passing a given point, and it is supposed that\r\nhardly less than 40,000 men were in line.\r\n\r\nFor several days and nights the ex-President and great general had\r\nhardly any time that he could call his own; receptions, entertainments,\r\nbanquets, and other methods of welcome and hospitality being kept up in\r\nrapid succession.\r\n\r\nHe was placed on the retired list of the army by a special act of\r\nCongress, March, 1884, with the rank and pay of General.\r\n\r\nDuring the last few months of his life he wrote his “Memoirs,” which was\r\npublished soon after his death, which occurred on Mount McGregor, near\r\nSaratoga, N. Y., July 23, 1885.\r\n\r\nHis body found its final resting place in a magnificent mausoleum in\r\nRiverside Park, New York City, overlooking the Hudson River.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Shikellamy, Vicegerent of Six Nations, Died\r\n                     in Shamokin, December 17, 1748\r\n\r\n\r\nShikellamy is the most picturesque and historic Indian character who\r\never lived in Pennsylvania. His early life is shrouded in mystery.\r\n\r\nIt has been claimed that he was a Susquehannock by birth, but others\r\nclaim his father was a Frenchman. John Bartram, who accompanied Conrad\r\nWeiser and Lewis Evans to Onondaga in 1743, wrote of Shikellamy in his\r\njournal: “July 10, 1743—He was of the Six Nations, or rather a Frenchman\r\nborn at Montreal, and adopted by the Oneidoes after being taken a\r\nprisoner, but his son told me that he (the son) was of the Cayuga\r\nNations.”\r\n\r\nDr. Crantz, in the “History of the Brethren,” 1768, writes of\r\nShikellamy:\r\n\r\n“When he was spoken to concerning baptism, he said he had been baptized\r\nin infancy. We were informed afterward that he was born of European\r\nparents in French Canada, taken prisoner when a child two years old and\r\nbrought up among the Indians. He was so much altered in his way of life\r\nthat he was hardly distinguished from other savages.”\r\n\r\nHis name, according to Dr. George P. Donehoo, State Librarian and an\r\neminent authority on the Indians of Pennsylvania, is a much corrupted\r\nform of the Oneida chieftain title, Ongwaternohiat-he, meaning, “It has\r\ncaused the sky to be light for us.” The other name, Swataney, is a\r\ncorrupt form of Onkhiswathe-tani, “He causes it to be light for us.”\r\n\r\nThe official spelling of the name is Skikellamy.\r\n\r\nHe was early trained in war, and for his valor was rewarded by adoption\r\ninto the Oneida tribe, of which he eventually became the chief, an\r\nexceptional distinction for one not a member of the tribe and possibly\r\nnot a full-blooded Indian by birth. It is not probable that he was\r\nappointed vicegerent before 1728. He was not present at the treaty with\r\nthe Five Nations in Philadelphia in July of the preceding year, and\r\nJames Le Tort does not mention him among the Indians of consequence whom\r\nhe met “on the upper parts of the River Susquehanna” in the winter of\r\n1727–28.\r\n\r\nThe first conference that he attended in Philadelphia was that of July\r\n4–5, 1728, but it does not appear that he took any part in the\r\nproceedings. He was present on a similar occasion in the following\r\nOctober, when, after the close of the conference, the Council considered\r\n“what present might be proper to be made to Shikellamy, of the Five\r\nNations, appointed to reside among the Shawnese, whose services had been\r\nand may yet further be of great advantage to this Government.”\r\n\r\nAt the close of a conference several years later, the Governor having\r\nrepresented that Shikellamy was “a trusty good man and a great lover of\r\nthe English,” commissioned him as a bearer of a present to the Six\r\nNations and a message inviting them to visit Philadelphia. This they\r\naccordingly accepted, arriving August 18, 1732.\r\n\r\nShikellamy was present on this occasion and he and Conrad Weiser were\r\nemployed to transact business between the Indians and the Provincial\r\nGovernment. He was a great friend of James Logan, and named one of his\r\nsons after this popular provincial officer.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1740, he went to Philadelphia to inquire against whom the\r\nBritish were making preparations for war, rumors of which had reached\r\nthe great council at Onondaga. He was also present at the conference in\r\nPhiladelphia July, 1742, at the treaty in Lancaster in June and July,\r\n1744, and at Philadelphia conference in the following August. On April,\r\n1748, accompanied by his son and Conrad Weiser, he visited Philadelphia\r\nfor the last time, but no business of a public nature was transacted.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief facts of his life as vicegerent of the Iroquois\r\nconfederation was his great friendliness to the cause of the Moravian\r\nmissionaries among the Indians. All the prominent leaders of the\r\nMoravian Church who came to the Susquehanna region, visited him at his\r\nhome at Shamokin, and were kindly received. Count Zinzindorf was among\r\nthese and none was more favorably impressed with the old Oneida\r\ndiplomat. His journal for September 22, 1742, reads:\r\n\r\n“He was truly an excellent and good man, possessed of many noble\r\nqualities of mind, that would do honor to many white men, laying claims\r\nto refinement and intelligence. He was possessed of great dignity,\r\nsobriety and prudence, and was particularly noted for his extreme\r\nkindness to the inhabitants with whom he came in contact.”\r\n\r\nLoskiel, who knew him well, thus speaks of him: “Being the first\r\nmagistrate, and head chief of all the Iroquois Indians living on the\r\nbanks of the Susquehanna, as far as Onondaga, he thought it incumbent\r\nupon him to be very circumspect in his dealings with the white people.\r\nHe assisted the missionaries in building, and defended them against the\r\ninsults of the drunken Indians; being himself never addicted to\r\ndrinking, because, as he expressed it, he never wished to become a\r\nfool.”\r\n\r\nHe had built his house upon pillars, for safety, in which he always shut\r\nhimself up when any drunken frolic was going on in the village.\r\n\r\nHe had been taken ill on a trip to Philadelphia, but so far recovered\r\nthat he had visited Conrad Weiser at Tulpehocken, April, 1748, and\r\ncompleted the trip to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nHe was again taken ill upon his return to Shamokin, and, in June,\r\nCouncil was advised he was so ill that he might lose his eyesight, but\r\nhe recovered sufficiently to make a trip to Bethlehem early in December.\r\nOn his return he became so ill that he only reached his home by the\r\nassistance of Bishop Zeisberger.\r\n\r\nHis death occurred December 17, 1748, and was extremely pathetic. His\r\ndaughter and the Reverend David Zeisberger were with him during his last\r\nillness and death.\r\n\r\nBishop Zeisberger and Henry Fry made him a coffin, and the Indians\r\npainted the body in their gayest colors, bedecked it with his choicest\r\nornaments, and placed with him his weapons, according to Indian custom.\r\nThen after Christian rites conducted by the good Bishop, he was buried\r\nin the Indian burying ground of his people, near the site of old Fort\r\nAugusta, in the present Sunbury.\r\n\r\nShikellamy left to mourn him three sons and a daughter. Another son,\r\nUnhappy Jake, was killed in the war with the Catawba in 1743. The three\r\nsons who survived were Taghneghdoarus, also known as John Shikellamy,\r\nwho succeeded his distinguished father in authority, but never gained\r\nthe confidence in which he was held by Indians or whites; Tahgahjute or\r\nSayughtowa, better known as James Logan, the most celebrated of the\r\nchildren of Shikellamy, and John Petty. His daughter was the widow of\r\nCajadies, the “best hunter among all the Indians,” who died in November,\r\n1747.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Shikellamy, Shamokin declined as a center of Indian\r\naffairs. His death was the beginning of evil days. His son\r\nTaghneghdoarus was made chief, but was unable to restrain his people.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Barbara Frietchie, Native of Pennsylvania,\r\n                         Died December 18, 1862\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere is the person who has not been thrilled with the reading or\r\nrecitation of John Greenleaf Whittier’s poem, “Barbara Frietchie?”\r\n\r\nIt is even doubtful if the Massachusetts Quaker poet realized how famous\r\nhe was going to make the venerable Barbara, and himself, when he penned\r\nhis immortal poem. But there are few persons of the present generation\r\nwho know anything about the personal side of Barbara Frietchie.\r\n\r\nThis patriot was born in Lancaster County, Pa., December 3, 1766, when\r\nGeorge Washington was a young man of thirty-four. She was the third\r\ndaughter of John Niclaus Hauer and Catherine Zeiler Hauer, who were both\r\nborn in Germany. In 1753 they emigrated to America.\r\n\r\nWhen Barbara was two years old her parents moved to Frederick, Md., then\r\na long distance away. The trip was made in old-fashioned ox carts.\r\n\r\nThis noted woman was born during patriotic times. The hated Stamp Act\r\nhad just been repealed. In fact, Frederick County, in 1765, was the\r\nfirst to officially protest against it.\r\n\r\nIt is said of Barbara that she met many of the patriots of that day, and\r\nwhen she was twenty-five years old she had the pleasure of conversing\r\nwith George Washington.\r\n\r\nThis event occurred one afternoon in 1791 at Kimball’s Tavern, now the\r\nCity Hall of Frederick.\r\n\r\nA number of ladies were participating in a quilting bee, when a\r\nmessenger leaped from his horse in front of the hotel and announced that\r\nPresident Washington would soon arrive and intended to pass the night at\r\nthe tavern.\r\n\r\nThis unusual news broke up the party, and the ladies turned in to assist\r\nin preparing for the reception to the great Washington.\r\n\r\nThe tavern did not possess a suitable coffee urn, and Barbara Hauer\r\nhurried to her home and returned with her choice Liverpool coffee pot, a\r\nprecious heirloom in the family.\r\n\r\nBarbara was the one who was specially assigned to look after the\r\npersonal comfort of the President, and her pretty face, pleasant manners\r\nand vivacious spirit greatly pleased the first President of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nAfter supper he gave Barbara a beautiful china bowl, which he was\r\ncarrying to Mount Vernon in his traveling bag. Nothing that she\r\npossessed in after life did she prize so highly as this precious gift.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the one romance of her life happened in an unusually\r\nstrange manner. When she was fourteen years old, Barbara accompanied her\r\nmother to a quilting party, where all sorts of things and events of that\r\nperiod were discussed, from parson to pig butchering, petticoats,\r\npumpkin pies, sickness, deaths and births. One old maiden lady coyly\r\nannounced that Mr. and Mrs. Casper Frietchie had that day been presented\r\nwith a fine baby boy. None present ventured the prediction that some day\r\nlittle Barbara would become the bride of this little John Casper\r\nFrietchie, but nevertheless, twenty-six years later, May 6, 1806, that\r\nis just what happened.\r\n\r\nDespite the somewhat unusual difference in their ages, they lived\r\nhappily throughout their married life. It is claimed their home was one\r\nof the most popular in Frederick.\r\n\r\nYoung Frietchie was the proud proprietor of a prosperous glove factory\r\nand he enjoyed a fair income.\r\n\r\nBesides taking much pride in her housekeeping Barbara Frietchie was a\r\ngreat reader and kept herself well informed upon subjects of that\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe Frietchies had no children of their own, but adopted Catharine\r\nStover, a niece of Mrs. Frietchie, who lived with them until she was\r\nmarried in 1825.\r\n\r\nMr. Frietchie died after a very short illness in 1849. Mrs. Frietchie\r\ncontinued to reside in their old home, where she devoted her time to her\r\nflowers, garden and the entertainment of her young relatives.\r\n\r\nAt the breaking out of the Civil War, Barbara Frietchie was one of\r\nAbraham Lincoln’s most loyal supporters.\r\n\r\nThe story of the flag-waving incident which resulted in Whittier’s poem\r\nis heard in different ways, but it is a fact that the geographical\r\nlocation of Frederick caused it to figure conspicuously in the movements\r\nof both armies.\r\n\r\nSentiment was naturally divided, there being a strong feeling both for\r\nand against the Union. It was a trying time, but the real bitterness of\r\nthe war came toward the close of the summer of 1862.\r\n\r\nThe Confederate forces had crossed the Potomac and entered Maryland on\r\nSeptember 5. The main body encamped at Frederick Junction, three miles\r\nsouth of Frederick, but a large portion of the army marched through the\r\ncity on September 6 and went into camp.\r\n\r\nThe next morning (Sunday), while his troops lay resting General\r\n“Stonewall” Jackson took advantage of the opportunity to attend divine\r\nworship.\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of the 10th the army broke camp and moved westward,\r\ngoing out West Patrick street, passing the home of Barbara Frietchie. It\r\nwas at this time the flag incident occurred.\r\n\r\nThe venerable patriot hearing the troops were approaching, took her silk\r\nflag from between the leaves of the old family Bible, and stepped out on\r\nher front porch, thinking they were Union soldiers. Immediately an\r\nofficer rode up, saying: “Granny, give me your flag.” “You can’t have\r\nit,” she said, and then she noticed the gray uniforms, but she continued\r\nto wave the flag.\r\n\r\nThe officer spoke to his men, and they turned facing her. She thought\r\nthey intended to fire on her, but, instead, the officer rode off a short\r\ndistance to Mill Alley, and returned in a moment with another officer\r\nand some soldiers.\r\n\r\nThis officer said to her: “Give me your flag, Granny, and I'll stick it\r\nin my horse’s head.” “No, you can’t have it,” she said. One of the men\r\nthen called out, “Shoot her damned head off.”\r\n\r\nThe officer turned angrily upon him, saying: “If you harm a hair of her\r\nhead, I'll shoot you down like a dog.” Then turning to the trembling old\r\nlady, he said: “Go on, Granny, wave your flag as much as you please.”\r\n\r\nThis version of the affair was related by Barbara Frietchie to her niece\r\nwho was visiting her, some time after the incident. It is also said that\r\nthis account has been certified by Confederate soldiers, who also stated\r\nthat the episode was talked about by the troops all through the lines.\r\n\r\nMcClellan’s army followed closely and none gave them a more joyous\r\nwelcome than dame Barbara, who, with her silk flag in hand, stood at her\r\nfront window. She attracted much attention, many soldiers going from the\r\nranks to speak to her.\r\n\r\nMrs. Frietchie did not live to see the victorious end of the Civil War.\r\nShortly after the celebration of her ninety-sixth birthday, on December\r\n3, 1862, she was stricken with pneumonia and died December 18, 1862. Her\r\nbody was tenderly carried to the churchyard and placed by the side of\r\nher husband.\r\n\r\nMay 30, 1913, the bodies of Barbara and her husband were reinterred in\r\nMount Olivet Cemetery at Frederick. On September 9, 1914, an artistic\r\nmonument in honor of the famous woman was unveiled upon which is a large\r\ntablet bearing the words of Whittier’s poem, “Barbara Frietchie.”\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Thaddeus Stevens Inquiry of Masonry and\r\n                     Odd Fellowship Began December\r\n                                19, 1835\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the gubernatorial election in October, 1835, owing to an unfortunate\r\ndefection in the Democratic ranks whereby there were two nominees for\r\nthat office, Governor George Wolf and Henry A. Muhlenberg, Joseph Ritner\r\nwas elected to the highest office of the State by a minority vote.\r\n\r\nIn possession of both the executive and legislative branches of the\r\nState Government, the Anti-Masons were determined to carry out various\r\nmeasures with a high hand.\r\n\r\nNo sooner did the session of the Legislature open in December following\r\nthan did Thaddeus Stevens, bring in a bill entitled: “An act to suppress\r\nsecret societies, bound together by secret and unlawful oaths,” while\r\nboth houses were deluged with petitions “praying God an investigation\r\ninto the evils of Freemasonry.”\r\n\r\nOn December 15, the oath of office was administered to Governor Ritner,\r\nafter which he addressed the members of both House and Senate. In this\r\ninaugural he used the following:\r\n\r\n“The supremacy of the laws, and the equal rights of the people, whether\r\nthreatened or assailed by individuals or by secret sworn associations, I\r\nshall, so far as may be compatible with the constitutional powers of the\r\nexecutive, endeavor to maintain, as well in compliance with the known\r\nwill of the people, as from obligations of duty to the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n“In these endeavors I shall entertain no doubt of zealous cooperation by\r\nthe enlightened and patriotic Legislature of the State. The people have\r\nwilled the destruction of all secret bodies, and that will cannot be\r\ndisregarded.”\r\n\r\nFour days later, December 19, on motion of Mr. Stevens himself, all the\r\npetitions were referred to a committee consisting of “Messrs. Stevens,\r\nCox, Huston (of Fayette) Spackman and Frew, with power to send for\r\npersons and papers.”\r\n\r\nOn the same day this committee organized and prepared a series of eleven\r\nquestions which were to be put to each person brought before the\r\ncommittee. The questions were intended to establish the fact of\r\nmembership in Free Masonry or Odd Fellowship and whether or not such\r\nwitness could repeat the several oaths of the society to which he\r\nbelonged.\r\n\r\nThis “Inquisition” held its first meeting December 23, 1835. To this\r\nstar chamber they obtained the evidence of a man named Shed, who had\r\nbeen imported for the purpose from the State of Ohio. He seems to have\r\nresided in several States, and to have arrived at Fort Niagara about the\r\ntime of Captain Morgan’s abduction, learned all about it, and was\r\nacquainted with the scoundrel Giddings, who, if his story was true, as\r\nwell as Shed’s, ought to have been hanged with him. If not true, they\r\nwere perjured villains. But the High Court of Inquisition was not after\r\nmartyrs, it was wire-pulling in other directions.\r\n\r\nA large number of prominent Masons, and citizens, were brought before\r\nthe committee, among them being ex-Governor Wolf, Francis R. Shunk,\r\nGeorge M. Dallas, Chief Justice Gibson, Josiah Randall, Samuel H.\r\nPerkins, Joseph R. Chandler, and the Reverend William T. Sproul. They\r\ninvariably declined being qualified, or answering any questions\r\npropounded by Mr. Stevens, and for their refusal to so testify, several\r\nof the gentlemen were brought to the bar of the House, but nothing more\r\nwas done to any of them.\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens was obliged to depend for witnesses upon seceding Masons,\r\nimported from Massachusetts, New York and Northern Pennsylvania. Their\r\nevidence, however, was only a rehash of Morgan and his successor,\r\nBernard, in their so-called “Revelations of the Doings of Freemasonry\r\nand Odd Fellowship.”\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens, unfortunately, could not control his temper, and in the\r\ncase of Rev. Mr. Sproul, when that gentleman, in reading his protest,\r\ncame to the expression, “Gentlemen, if you are willing to convert\r\nyourselves into a modern Juggernaut, then roll on,” “Stop,” thundered\r\nthe chairman of the “inquisition,” white with wrath and further reading\r\nwas dispensed with.\r\n\r\nGovernor Wolf, in his letter to the committee, wrote:\r\n\r\n“The Constitution is explicit and declaratory of the personal security\r\nof the people, and is the precious repository of the privileges of the\r\nfreemen of this Commonwealth which never shall have a wound inflicted\r\nupon its sacred reservations, through any person, without a solemn\r\nasseveration of its principles.\r\n\r\n“What article of the Constitution clothes the House with power to\r\ninstitute such an investigation? What article of the venerated\r\ninstrument forbids the people from associating together in pursuit of\r\ntheir own happiness? If the association is criminal, or in violation of\r\nany principle of the Constitution or laws, the mode and manner of\r\nsuppressing the unlawful combination must be in accordance with the\r\nConstitution and laws.\r\n\r\n“I have yet to learn that an inquisition at whose shrine the rights and\r\nliberties of the citizens are to be invaded, is authorized by the\r\nprinciples of our institutions; or that any power exists by which a\r\ncitizen can be coerced to give testimony before any tribunal, or for any\r\nobject other than the investigation of matters at issue, affecting the\r\nrights of persons or of things.”\r\n\r\nAn incident occurred about this period which fully exemplified to what\r\nlength the enemies of Freemasonry would go. All sorts of crimes or\r\ncollusions with crimes were imputed to the craft. Everything that was\r\nvile was blamed upon the fraternity.\r\n\r\nA murder was committed between Middletown and Hummelstown. Female\r\napparel was found which was recognized as belonging to Sophia Garman,\r\nwho was missing from her home. Search was made, and some one discovered\r\nwhere the earth had been recently disturbed in the center of which was a\r\nbranch of a spruce or cedar tree. An investigation resulted in finding\r\nthe body of the murdered girl.\r\n\r\nThe people who had been reading everything anti-Masonic at once jumped\r\nto the conclusion that this was the work of one who was a Mason. An\r\nindividual who was last seen with the unfortunate girl was arrested and\r\nit was broadcasted that he was a member of Perseverance Lodge, No. 21,\r\nFree and Accepted Masons, of Harrisburg. His name was Tom McHenry.\r\n\r\nIn the course of events, there not being the least evidence upon which\r\nto convict him, the accused was declared not guilty.\r\n\r\nThe outside conclusion then was that the jury must have been composed of\r\nMasons and the result could not be otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that McHenry was not a Mason nor was a single member of the\r\njury which tried him.\r\n\r\nThe Stevens investigation continued for nearly a month and ended in\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nThe men whom the committee tried to impanel would not testify; those who\r\ndid were pretended renouncers of Masonry. Concerning the real motive of\r\nStevens public opinion was divided.\r\n\r\nStevens would have resorted to strong measures to compel witnesses to\r\ntestify if he had not seen that the tide of public opinion was turning\r\nagainst the inquiry. To preserve appearances a lengthy report was\r\nsubmitted and adopted.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Storm Stops French Refugees in Settlement\r\n                         Work December 20, 1793\r\n\r\n\r\nFrenchtown, or Asylum, was the name of a settlement founded in\r\nNorthumberland County (now Bradford) in 1793, by French refugees as the\r\nresidence of the doomed Queen of France, Marie Antoinette. But the\r\nTerrorists prevented her ever seeing America.\r\n\r\nDuring the French Revolution, when many of the Frenchmen fled from their\r\nhomes, not a few sought refuge in San Domingo, and those jumped from the\r\nfrying pan into the fire. The Negro slaves soon heard of the success of\r\nthe Revolution in France and revolted against their masters. That bloody\r\nconflict was termed the “Horrors of San Domingo.” Many of the French\r\nexiles came to America and took up their residence in Philadelphia,\r\nwhere they were cordially welcomed.\r\n\r\nSo great was the number of refugees it was deemed necessary that some\r\nprovision should be made for their settlement as a colony.\r\n\r\nThe two most active and influential promoters of the colony scheme were\r\nViscount Louis Marie de Noailles and the Marquis Antoine Omer Talon. The\r\nformer was a distinguished military officer under Rochambeau in the\r\nsiege of Yorktown, Va., where he commanded a regiment. He was one of the\r\nCommissioners to arrange the articles of capitulation for the surrender\r\nof Cornwallis. He was a brother-in-law of Lafayette.\r\n\r\nMarquis Talon belonged to one of the most illustrious families of the\r\nFrench magistracy. He was Advocate General when the Revolution broke\r\nout. In 1790 he was compromised in the flight of the King, Louis XVII,\r\nand was arrested and imprisoned for a time. He fled to Marseilles, where\r\na wine merchant, Bartholomew Laporte, placed him in a large wine cask\r\nand carried him aboard a vessel sailing for America.\r\n\r\nLaporte sailed with Talon and they became citizens of the United States.\r\nThe borough of Laporte takes its name from Judge John Laporte, son of\r\nthe early immigrant.\r\n\r\nThe refugees organized a company, and M. Charles Felix Beu Boulogne, and\r\nAdam Hoopes were delegated to select a site. They proceeded to\r\nWilkes-Barre, where they arrived August 27, 1793. Judge Matthais\r\nHollenback accepted their letter of credit from Robert Morris.\r\n\r\nThey examined several localities, and finally selected the Schufeldt\r\nFlats, now called Frenchtown, in the Township of Asylum, nearly opposite\r\nRummerfield station, in Bradford County.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of November, M. de Noailles, who continued to reside in\r\nPhiladelphia, visited the place which took the name of Asylum, or\r\n“Azilum,” as the French pronounced it. The plan of settlement was\r\ndetermined, and the town surveyed into lots.\r\n\r\nThe tract consists of 2400 acres and, in addition, the Asylum Company\r\nhad secured title to a number of tracts of “wild land,” as it was\r\ntermed, in the present Counties of Bradford, Sullivan, Lycoming and\r\nLuzerne, which were sold on liberal terms to actual settlers. The town,\r\nas laid out, contained, besides an open square and fine wide streets,\r\n413 house lots of an acre each.\r\n\r\nM. Boulogne bent every energy to get the houses ready for the colonists\r\nin the early spring, and was favored with mild weather until five days\r\nbefore Christmas, when the weather became stormy. The work, which was\r\nsuspended December 20, was resumed in the spring. The emigrants then\r\nbegan to arrive. They traveled by land to Catawissa, thence in boats up\r\nthe river.\r\n\r\nThe houses were built of hewn logs two stories high, roofed with pine\r\nshingles, and all houses had a good cellar. To the native Americans\r\nthese houses looked like palaces.\r\n\r\nThe house built by M. Talon was the most pretentious, and is said to be\r\nthe largest log house ever built in America. It was known as “La Grande\r\nMaison,” or the great house. This house stood until 1846, when it was\r\ntorn down.\r\n\r\nM. Talon, who was general manager, planned improvements on a large\r\nscale. He built a horsepower grist mill, several stores, a tavern, for\r\nwhich a license was granted in August, 1794, to Mr. Lefevre. A small\r\nCatholic chapel was erected, and later a theatre was built. They set up\r\na bakery and built a brewery. A post was established with Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nMost of the emigrants had been wealthy, and some of them members of the\r\nroyal household, entirely ignorant of farming and unused to manual\r\nlabor, found great difficulty in adapting themselves to their new\r\nconditions. Yet they endured their privations with great fortitude.\r\n\r\nThe continuance of the Asylum settlement was less than ten years, but\r\nthe Frenchmen set their Pennsylvania neighbors the example of better\r\nhouses and roads, better gardens and orchards and courteous manners.\r\n\r\nRobespierre issued a decree commanding all emigrants to return to France\r\nunder penalty of having their estates confiscated. When the strong hand\r\nof Napoleon assumed power, all Frenchmen were invited to return. This\r\nwas joyous news at Asylum, and they returned to their beloved France as\r\nsoon as they could dispose of their property, until only two remained.\r\n\r\nIn 1796 Asylum consisted of about fifty log houses occupied by about\r\nforty families. Among the most noted, besides those already mentioned,\r\nwere M. De Blacons, a member of the French Constituent Assembly from\r\nDauphine; M. Le Montule, a captain of a troop of horse; M. Beaulieu, a\r\ncaptain of infantry in the French service, who served in the Revolution\r\nin this country under Potosky; Dr. Buzzard a planter from San Domingo,\r\nand M. Dandelot, an officer in the French Infantry.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the best known of all, at least in this country, was M.\r\nDupretit-Thouars, or as he was generally called by the Americans, the\r\nAdmiral. Wrecked while on a voyage in search of La Perouse, he reached\r\nAsylum destitute of everything but an unfaltering courage, a genial\r\ntemper and the chivalrous pride of a Frenchman.\r\n\r\nDisdaining to be a pensioner on the bounty of his countrymen he obtained\r\na grant of four hundred acres in the dense wilderness of what is now\r\nSullivan County, and went out literally single-handed, having lost an\r\narm in the French naval service, commenced a clearing, built himself a\r\nhouse, returning to Asylum once a week for necessary food and change of\r\napparel.\r\n\r\nHe returned to his native country, obtained a position in the navy,\r\nsaying he had yet another arm to give to France. He was placed in\r\ncommand of the ship Le Tonnant and was killed in the battle of the Nile.\r\n\r\nThe borough of Dushore, which includes the clearings of this indomitable\r\nFrenchman, was named in honor of him this being nearly the Anglicised\r\npronunciation of his name.\r\n\r\nDuring the continuance of the settlement, it was visited by many very\r\ndistinguished personages who since obtained a world-wide reputation.\r\n\r\nLouis Philippe, a future King of France, spent several weeks at Asylum\r\nenjoying the hospitality of M. Antoine Talon. In 1795 Talleyrand spent\r\nsome time there and Count de la Rochefoucauld de Laincourt was several\r\ndays at Asylum while on his journey through the States in 1795–6.\r\nAnother notable visitor was Mrs. Blennerhassett the charming woman who\r\nfigured in Aaron Burr’s conspiracy.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                General Thomas Mifflin Inaugurated First\r\n                   Governor of Pennsylvania December\r\n                                21, 1790\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inauguration of the first Governor of the Commonwealth of\r\nPennsylvania took place December 21, 1790, when Hon. Thomas Mifflin was\r\ninducted into office amid all the splendor of that now distant day.\r\n\r\nThe transfer of the present State of Pennsylvania from a feudal province\r\nto a sovereign State was effected by the promulgation on September 28,\r\n1776, of the first Constitution. This was so thoroughly revolutionary\r\nthat it was never fully approved of by the people of the State.\r\n\r\nThe Council of Censors, to which was delegated important duties, met for\r\nits only meeting, November 10, 1783. This body discussed various\r\namendments and strong differences of opinion were manifested. They sat\r\neight months and then recommended a continuance of the present form of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThey said: “Give it a fair and honest trial, and if after all, at the\r\nend of another seven years (the time when this Council of Censors would\r\nagain meet), it shall be found necessary or proper to cause any changes\r\nthey may then be brought in and established upon a full conviction of\r\ntheir usefulness, with harmony and good temper, without noise, tumult or\r\nviolence.”\r\n\r\nNevertheless the Constitution of 1776 proved inadequate for the\r\nrequirements of a useful and an effective government, and its revision\r\nwas imperatively demanded. The newspapers, from the close of the\r\nRevolution for a period of six years are filled with elaborate\r\ncommunications in favor of, and opposed to, any change. The adoption of\r\nthe Federal Constitution in 1787, however, and its successful working,\r\nimpressed the people that some revisions should be made in the\r\nConstitution of the State.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions of the Assembly were adopted by the electorate and the\r\nconvention called, and organized with General Thomas Mifflin as\r\npresident. After a long session, the new instrument was adopted\r\nSeptember 2, 1790, and then by the people.\r\n\r\nThe personnel of the Constitutional Convention of 1790 was one of\r\nunusual ability. Thomas Mifflin, soon to be elected the first Governor\r\nunder its provisions; James Wilson and William Lewis, two of the most\r\nnoted lawyers of that time; Thomas McKean, the second; Simon Snyder, of\r\nNorthumberland County; William Findlay, of Westmoreland County, and\r\nJoseph Heister, of Berks County, each of whom filled in their turn the\r\ngubernatorial office, were members of this body. General William Irvine,\r\nof Carlisle; General John Gibson, of Allegheny County, and Colonel Jacob\r\nCook, of Lancaster, all of Revolutionary fame, and Robert Whitehill, of\r\nDauphin County. Charles Smith, author of “Smith’s Laws,” was Simon\r\nSnyder’s colleague from Northumberland County.\r\n\r\nOf the seventy-one persons who composed this illustrious body there was\r\nnot one who had not taken a prominent part in public affairs during the\r\nstruggle for liberty. It was a body of intellectual men, such as any\r\nCommonwealth could be justly proud.\r\n\r\nAt the election in October, 1790, General Thomas Mifflin and General\r\nArthur St. Clair were the opposing candidates for Governor. The vote in\r\nthe State for Mifflin was 27,118, and for St. Clair 2819. Under the\r\nConstitution the General Assembly met on the first Tuesday in December,\r\nwhen the Senate and House promptly organized and a committee of\r\nconference was appointed by both houses to consider and report a time,\r\nplace and manner in which the election of Governor should be published,\r\nnotified and proclaimed, and the oath prescribed by the Constitution\r\nadministered to the Governor.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, December 17, the House of Representatives attended in the\r\nSenate chamber, where Richard Peters, Speaker of the House, was seated\r\non the right of William Bingham, Speaker of the Senate. The returns of\r\nthe election for Governor were opened, when Thomas Mifflin was declared\r\nduly chosen Governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of December 21, 1790, after the members of the Senate and\r\nHouse had assembled in the Senate chamber, the Speaker of the Senate\r\ninformed both houses that according to their order the certificate of\r\nthe election of the Governor was recorded in the rolls office of this\r\nCommonwealth, whereupon the committee of both houses of the Legislature,\r\nthree representing the Senate and three representing the House of\r\nRepresentatives, waited upon the Governor-elect and at the hour of 12:30\r\nintroduced Thomas Mifflin into the Senate chamber and he was seated in\r\nfront of the Speakers.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Justice, the Hon. Thomas McKean, in solemn form administered\r\nto Mr. Mifflin the oath required by the Constitution of the Commonwealth\r\nand also the oath required by the Constitution of the United States,\r\nwhich said oaths the Governor-elect took, and subscribed in the Senate\r\nchamber, and Speaker and members of the House of Representatives and the\r\nGovernor then withdrew from the Senate chamber in order to proceed to\r\nthe court house on High Street, agreeably to the following order of\r\nprocession:\r\n\r\nConstables with their staffs; sub-sheriffs with their wands; High\r\nSheriff and Coroner with their wands; Judges of the Supreme Court and\r\nJudge of the High Court of Errors and Appeals; Attorney General and\r\nProthonotary of the Supreme Court; wardens of the Port of Philadelphia;\r\nTreasurer, Comptroller and Register General; Secretary of the Land\r\nOffice; Receiver General and Surveyor General; justices of the peace;\r\nProthonotary of the Court of Common Pleas and clerk of the Court of\r\nQuarter Sessions; clerk of the Mayor’s court and the corporation; Mayor,\r\nRecorder and aldermen; Common Council, two and two; Master of the Rolls\r\nand Register of Wills; Register of German Passengers and Collector of\r\nExcise in the City and County of Philadelphia; assistant secretary of\r\nCouncil, members of Council, two and two; the Governor-elect;\r\nsergeant-at-arms of the Senate; clerk of the Senate; Speaker of the\r\nSenate; members of the Senate, two and two; doorkeeper of the Senate;\r\nsergeant-at-arms of the House of Representatives; assistant clerk;\r\nclerk; members, two and two; doorkeeper; provost and faculty of the\r\nUniversity, two and two; officers of the militia; citizens.\r\n\r\nArriving at the court house, the certificate of the election of the\r\nGovernor was read by the clerk of the Senate, when the official\r\nproclamation was thrice made by the clerk of the court declaring Thomas\r\nMifflin Governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and\r\ncommander-in-chief of the army and navy thereof. This being done, the\r\nprocession reformed, returning to the Senate chamber. The Governor then\r\ndelivered his inaugural address.\r\n\r\nOn the days following various bodies of tradesmen and society\r\norganizations waited upon the Governor and tendered their\r\ncongratulations, and upon the first day of January following, City\r\nCouncils, with the Mayor and Recorder, waited upon his Excellency and\r\nformally congratulated him on his accession to his high office.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               First Newspaper in Pennsylvania Published\r\n                           December 22, 1719\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first newspaper published in Pennsylvania was entitled the American\r\nWeekly Mercury, and was established by Andrew Bradford, at Philadelphia,\r\nand sold by John Copsom. The initial number appeared December 22, 1719.\r\n\r\nThe Mercury was published weekly, generally on Tuesday, but the day of\r\npublication varied.\r\n\r\nAndrew Bradford died November 23, 1742; and the next number of the\r\nMercury, dated December 2, appeared in mourning.\r\n\r\nThe widow, Cornelia Bradford, took into partnership Isaiah Warner in\r\nMarch, 1742, and they continued to publish the Mercury until October 18,\r\n1744, when Cornelia Bradford resumed the publication alone, and until\r\nthe end of 1746, when it was discontinued.\r\n\r\nThe second newspaper established in the Province was the Universal\r\nInstructor in All Arts and Science; and Pennsylvania Gazette, which\r\ncontinued in publication for many years, becoming the oldest newspaper\r\nin the United States a half century after its establishment.\r\n\r\nThis newspaper first appeared December 24, 1728, and was edited by\r\nSamuel Keimer, and printed on a small sheet, pot size folio, 15½ by 12½\r\ninches.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Franklin soon after he began business formed the design of\r\npublishing a newspaper, but was prevented by the sudden appearance of\r\nthis Gazette, and was so greatly disappointed that he used his endeavors\r\nto bring it into contempt. In this he was successful, and Keimer was\r\nsoon obliged to relinquish it, for a trifling consideration, and\r\nFranklin purchased the good will and fixtures.\r\n\r\nAt this time Franklin was in partnership with Hugh Meredith. The first\r\npart of the title was soon dropped and the paper was called the\r\nPennsylvania Gazette. It soon gained reputation, and when Franklin\r\nbecame postmaster the Gazette enjoyed a wide circulation and liberal\r\nadvertising patronage.\r\n\r\nThe partnership was dissolved in 1732, and Franklin in 1748 took into\r\npartnership David Hall.\r\n\r\nOn May 9, 1754, the device of a snake divided into parts, with the\r\nmotto—“Join or Die,” appeared in this paper. It accompanied an account\r\nof the French and Indians having killed and scalped many inhabitants\r\nalong the frontiers. The account was published with this device, with a\r\nview to rouse the British Colonies and cause them to unite in effectual\r\nmeasures for their defense and security against common enemy.\r\n\r\nThe snake was divided into eight parts to represent first New England;\r\nsecond, New York; third, New Jersey; fourth, Pennsylvania; fifth,\r\nMaryland; sixth, Virginia; seventh, North Carolina, and eighth, South\r\nCarolina.\r\n\r\nThe Gazette put on mourning October 31, 1765, on account of the Stamp\r\nAct, passed by the British Parliament, which was to take effect the next\r\nday. From that time until November 21 following the publication of it\r\nwas suspended.\r\n\r\nIn the interim, large handbills, as substitutes, were published. When\r\nrevived, it was published without an imprint until February 6, 1766,\r\nwhen it then appeared with the name of David Hall, only, who now became\r\nthe proprietor and the printer of it.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1766, it was published by Hall and Sellers, who continued it\r\nuntil 1777; but on the approach of the British Army, the publishers\r\nretired from Philadelphia and the publication was suspended while the\r\nBritish possessed the city.\r\n\r\nOn the evacuation of Philadelphia, the Gazette was again revived, and\r\npublished once a week until the death of Sellers in 1804. After this\r\nevent, it was printed by William and David Hall, then later by Hall and\r\nPierre. When the Gazette observed its centennial of publication, a\r\ngrandson of David and son of William Hall was the publisher.\r\n\r\nThe next newspaper to be established in Pennsylvania was the\r\nPennsylvania Journal and Weekly Advertiser, which made its initial bow\r\nto the public, Tuesday, December 2, 1742. Its publisher was William\r\nBradford.\r\n\r\nIn 1776, William and Thomas Bradford were the publishers and, like the\r\nGazette, suspended publication during the British occupancy of\r\nPhiladelphia, but it was revived soon afterward.\r\n\r\nA newspaper in the German language was published in Philadelphia as\r\nearly as May, 1743, by Joseph Crellius. It was called the “High Dutch\r\nPennsylvania Journal.”\r\n\r\nIn September, 1751, the “Dutch and English Gazette” was published in the\r\ntwo languages “at the German Printing Office,” in Arch Street, by\r\nGotthan Armbruster.\r\n\r\nDer Wochentliche Philadelphische Staatsbote was first printed in the\r\nGerman language in January, 1762, by Henry Miller. This was a successful\r\nnewspaper. It continued until 1779.\r\n\r\nTwo papers printed in German were published in Germantown, one by\r\nChristopher Sower, in 1739, called the Pennsylvania German Recorder of\r\nEvents. This was discontinued in 1744, when Christopher Sower, Jr.,\r\nbegan the publication of the Germantown Zeitung, and continued until the\r\nRevolutionary War.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania Chronicle and Universal Advertiser made its appearance\r\nMonday, January 6, 1767. It was published by William Goddard.\r\n\r\nThis was the fourth paper in the English language established in\r\nPhiladelphia and the first one with four columns to the page, printed in\r\nall the colonies. Joseph Galloway and Thomas Wharton were silent\r\npartners of Goddard. The Chronicle was published until February, 1773,\r\nwhen it was removed to Baltimore.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania Packet, or the General Advertiser, was first published\r\nin November, 1771, by John Dunlap. During the British occupancy Dunlap\r\ncontinued the publication of the Packet at Lancaster, and in July, 1778,\r\nhe published at Philadelphia, and made it a semi-weekly, and then a\r\ntri-weekly.\r\n\r\nIn 1783, Dunlap sold his paper to D. C. Claypoole, who had previously\r\nbeen a partner, and a year later the Packet was published daily. This\r\nthen became the first daily newspaper in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania Ledger, or the Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and New\r\nJersey Weekly Advertiser, was first published in Philadelphia, January\r\n28, 1775, by James Humphreys, Jr. Humphreys was deemed a Tory and his\r\npaper denounced as being under corrupt influence. Humphreys was obliged\r\nin November, 1776, to discontinue the Ledger, and leave the city.\r\n\r\nHe returned when the British occupied Philadelphia and revived the\r\npublication as a semi-weekly. The last number was published May 23,\r\n1778, a month before the British evacuated the city. He was in\r\npossession of advance information, as are some editors of today.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania Evening Post by Benjamin Towne, as a tri-weekly, was\r\nfirst published January 24, 1775, and it was the third newspaper in the\r\ncolonies which was published as an evening paper. This paper continued\r\npublication in Philadelphia during the British occupancy.\r\n\r\nTowne was proscribed by a law of Pennsylvania. He did not, however,\r\nleave the State, and continued to publish the Post until 1782, when it\r\ndied a natural death.\r\n\r\nStory and Humphrey’s Pennsylvania Mercury and Universal Advertiser first\r\ncame before the public in April, 1775.

Watson, Annalist, Historian, Antiquarian\r\n                  and Collector of Historical Objects,\r\n                         Died December 23, 1860\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Fanning Watson died December 23, 1860, at the age of eighty-two\r\nyears, and left behind him a monument to his mental powers in his\r\n“Annals of Philadelphia.”\r\n\r\nMr. Watson was a native of Burlington County, N. J., where he was born\r\nJune 13, 1779. His parents were of English origin; his grandfather,\r\nThomas Watson, came to America in 1667, settling at Salem, where William\r\nWatson, father of John F. was born.\r\n\r\nAmong his ancestors were some of the earliest settlers of our country.\r\nAll were devoted patriots, with the exception of one, a distinguished\r\nTory, General Edmund Fanning, a graduate of Yale, in 1757, of whom The\r\nGentleman’s Magazine, for 1818, says, “the world contained no better\r\nman.”\r\n\r\nAfter completing the usual course of education to qualify himself for\r\nmercantile pursuits, John Fanning Watson entered the counting-house of\r\nJames Vanuxem, an eminent merchant of Philadelphia, with whom he\r\nremained but a short time, having offended the French interests of that\r\nfirm by becoming a member of the Macpherson Blues, of which body of\r\nvolunteer militiamen, he was one of last six surviving members at the\r\ntime of his decease.\r\n\r\nHe was now nineteen years of age, and a clerkship in the War Department\r\nat Washington was offered him, which he accepted, and held until 1804,\r\nwhen he engaged himself in business with General James O'Hara, formerly\r\nQuartermaster-General to General Anthony Wayne’s Indian Army, and chief\r\nfounder of the City of Pittsburgh.\r\n\r\nDuring this business connection Watson resided at New Orleans, holding\r\nthe responsible position of Commissary of Provisions for the United\r\nStates Army at all the posts in Louisiana.\r\n\r\nAt this period there was no Protestant worship in that city, and to\r\nremedy this, together with Edward Livingston, he became the prime. mover\r\nin establishing the Protestant Episcopal Church by giving a call to the\r\nReverend Mr. Chase, since the venerable Bishop of Ohio and Illinois.\r\n\r\nAfter a residence of two years at New Orleans sudden domestic affliction\r\ncaused his return to Philadelphia to the support of his widowed mother,\r\nand to this event the public are profoundly indebted for his invaluable\r\nservices as a local historian of the olden time. As such his works will\r\never be enduring monuments of his wonderful assiduity and laborious\r\nresearch.\r\n\r\nFollowing his return to Philadelphia he made his first essay as a\r\nbookseller and publisher, establishing a business on Chestnut Street.\r\n\r\nAmong the various works he published were Dr. Adam Clark’s Commentary on\r\nthe Old and New Testament, the Select Reviews of Literature, etc.\r\n\r\nHe contributed frequently to the columns of various literary,\r\nscientific, historical, and ecclesiastical serials.\r\n\r\nBesides historical works, he left some unpublished manuscript volumes on\r\ntheology, which show great originality of thought and deep research. He\r\nalso devoted some pages to the vindication of Cromwell. To his marriage\r\nwith a lineal descendant of the Lord Protector may be attributed some of\r\nthe interest he evinced on this subject.\r\n\r\nIn 1814, Mr. Watson was elected cashier of the Bank of Germantown, which\r\nposition he held till 1847, when he was chosen treasurer and secretary\r\nof the Philadelphia, Germantown and Norristown Railroad Company.\r\n\r\nDuring his connection with the Bank of Germantown he resided in the\r\nstone bank building of which the celebrated annalist himself says, “The\r\nhouse in which I now reside was once honoured with the presence of\r\nGenerals Washington, Knox and Greene, shortly after the battle of\r\nGermantown. They slept in it one or two nights.”\r\n\r\nIn 1859, being at that time eighty years of age, he retired from all\r\nactive business.\r\n\r\nIn 1820, he began to collect antiquarian material, the first being\r\nhistory and legends of Germantown, though none of them were printed\r\nuntil about 1828, when some extracts from his manuscript books were\r\nprinted in Hazard’s “Register of Pennsylvania.”\r\n\r\nIn 1830 the first edition of the “Annals of Philadelphia,” was issued,\r\nthe same “being a Collection of Memoirs, Anecdotes, and Incidents of the\r\nCity and its Inhabitants from the days of the Pilgrim Fathers; also\r\nOlden Time Researches and Reminiscences of New York City in 1828.” It\r\nwas in one volume of eight hundred pages, and illustrated by\r\nlithographs.\r\n\r\nIn 1842 the work was republished in two volumes, revised and enlarged,\r\nand again, in 1856, he made a full and final revision, adding an\r\nappendix to the second volume. The editions subsequent to the first did\r\nnot contain the matter relative to New York.\r\n\r\nA noteworthy characteristic of Watson was his reverence for the graves\r\nof great and good men, who had been useful in their generation, as\r\nillustrated in the removal of the remains of Thomas Godfrey, the\r\ninventor of the quadrant, and family from a neglected spot on his old\r\nfarm to Laurel Hill, where a suitable monument was erected by\r\nsubscription to his memory.\r\n\r\nIn 1832, he published “Historic Tales of Olden Time” of New York City,\r\nwhich was followed the next year by “Historic Tales of Olden Time,\r\nconcerning the Early Settlement and Progress of Philadelphia and\r\nPennsylvania.”\r\n\r\nThen followed other volumes of both New York annals and works other than\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nMr. Watson’s first publisher and most active co-worker was Samuel\r\nHazard, and to them is due the awakening of that spirit of\r\nantiquarianism and historical research from which sprung the great\r\nHistorical Society of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nMr. Watson was an ardent collector of all objects of historic interest,\r\nmany of which are now deposited in the Philadelphia Library and with the\r\nHistorical Society.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Colonel Plunket Begins Action in Second\r\n                   Pennamite War on December 24, 1775\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first armed conflict between the Proprietary Government and the\r\nConnecticut settlers in the Wyoming Valley occurred when the Yankees\r\ncame down into the region in 1769 and seated themselves under the\r\nGovernment of Connecticut. The conflict lasted, with more or less\r\nintensity, until 1771, when the Penns were compelled to surrender and\r\nleave the intruders in questioned possession of that territory. This\r\nseries of attacks, assaults and real battles has since been known as the\r\nfirst Pennamite War.\r\n\r\nFor four years the Yankees lived in tranquillity, and were not even\r\nseriously disturbed by the Indians.\r\n\r\nOn September 28, 1775, Colonel William Plunket, the Provincial\r\ncommandant at Fort Augusta, at the head of a large body of troops,\r\ndefeated the Yankees at Squire John Vincent’s in Judea Township on the\r\nWest Branch, and marched all the men as prisoners to Sunbury.\r\n\r\nThe old colonel was more elated than wisdom seems to have justified. He\r\nbecame the man of the hour and, supported by a resolution of the\r\nProvincial Assembly, October 27, 1775, which justified the attack on the\r\nYankees, he set about to muster troops for an expedition against the\r\nConnecticut settlers at Wyoming, in spite of the fact that the weather\r\nwas becoming very severe. Snow had fallen early in November.\r\n\r\nThe Council of Safety of Connecticut learned of the determination to\r\nsend a large armed force against their settlement at Wyoming, and\r\nGovernor Trumbull wrote to the President of Congress, November 11, 1775,\r\ncomplaining of this invasion.\r\n\r\nCongress adopted a resolution requesting both States to prevent\r\nhostilities. But the Assembly did not welcome this interference,\r\nespecially as they had received a letter from Colonel Samuel Hunter,\r\nlieutenant for Northumberland County, dated Sunbury, November 20, 1775,\r\nacquainting the House that two of the Magistrates and Sheriff William\r\nCooke had an interview with Colonel Zebulon Butler and some of the\r\nprincipal men among the Connecticut settlers at Wyoming. They read the\r\nlate Resolves of the Pennsylvania Assembly to them, and inquired whether\r\nthey would peaceably submit themselves to the laws of Pennsylvania. They\r\nanswered that they despised the laws of that Province and never would\r\nsubmit unless compelled by force.\r\n\r\nTwo days later, November 25, Governor John Penn wrote to Judge Plunket\r\nand his associate Justices as follows:\r\n\r\n“I have just now received a message from the Assembly, founded on a\r\nletter addressed to them from the county of Northumberland, respecting\r\nthe Connecticut settlers at Wyoming, requesting me to give orders for a\r\ndue execution of the laws of this Province in the counties of\r\nNorthumberland and Northampton. In consequence thereof, I do most\r\ncheerfully order you to use your utmost diligence and activity in\r\nputting the laws of this Province in execution throughout the County of\r\nNorthumberland; and you may depend on the faith of the House, and my\r\nconcurrence with them, that every proper and necessary expense that may\r\nbe incurred on the occasion will be defrayed.”\r\n\r\nAfter the failure of the expedition to Squire Vincent’s the New\r\nEnglanders in Wyoming managed, by the aid of spies, and in other ways,\r\nto keep themselves informed as to the movements of the Pennamites.\r\n\r\nThere are letters extant which reveal the activities in and about\r\nSunbury which were written there and sent to Colonel Butler and others\r\nin authority at Wyoming. One such letter advised Colonel Butler that the\r\nPennamites were surely going to march against Wyoming, and would not be\r\nstopped even by Congress.\r\n\r\nIt was the purpose of Colonel Plunket to recruit all the troops which\r\ncould be raised along the West Branch settlements at Fort Augusta, and\r\nthen form a junction with the troops which were to be raised in\r\nNorthampton County, at Fishing Creek, about a mile and a half above the\r\npresent borough of Bloomsburg.\r\n\r\nThe Connecticut delegates in Congress presented a memorial in that body\r\non December 18, 1775, in which they complained bitterly of the\r\nthreatened invasion, and advised Congress that the troops had begun to\r\nmarch December 11. This was accompanied by depositions from inhabitants,\r\ntending to strengthen their statements about the number of the invading\r\nforces and their intentions.\r\n\r\nDuring the continuance of the first Pennamite War from 1769 to 1771,\r\nevery expedition against Wyoming was of a civil character. There were no\r\ndirect military maneuvers. The Sheriff of Northampton County, of which\r\ncounty Wyoming was then a part, was the chief officer on duty, merely\r\nsupported by the military commanders, with their several companies; the\r\nburnished musket, the glittering bayonet, the four-pounder, the whole\r\nmartial array being simply an appurtenant to a peace officer while he\r\nshould serve a civil process.\r\n\r\nThe same policy was again pursued. Colonel Plunket and his large force\r\nand fine equipment, were the mere accompaniments of the Sheriff, whose\r\nbusiness to Wyoming was to arrest two or three individuals on civil\r\nwrits.\r\n\r\nThe old colonel had mustered 600 well-armed and well-equipped men and\r\nthe march was taken up at Fort Augusta, December 15, 1775.\r\n\r\nIn order that the proposed expedition might be considered of a civil\r\nrather than a military character, this small army was denominated the\r\n“_posse comitatus_ of Northumberland.” Moreover it was to be accompanied\r\non its march by William Scull, the newly elected Sheriff of\r\nNorthumberland County, within whose jurisdiction the Wyoming lands lay,\r\nif to be considered a part of the Province of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nHe was provided with a train of boats, with two small field-pieces, one\r\nof which was mounted on the largest and leading boat, ready for action\r\non board or to be landed if necessary. There was a second field-piece\r\nmounted on one of the other boats, a large supply of ammunition for\r\ncannon, rifles and muskets, supplies and stores.\r\n\r\nAbout the time Colonel Plunket began active preparations for his\r\nexpedition Benjamin Harvey, Jr., and another Yankee settler and trader\r\nof Wyoming Valley, who were returning from Harris Ferry in bateaux laden\r\nwith supplies, and laboriously and slowly pulling their boats up the\r\nSusquehanna toward home, were seized by the Pennsylvanians as they\r\nreached Sunbury, thrown into jail, and their boats and cargoes\r\nconfiscated.\r\n\r\nWhen Plunket was ready to proceed up the river he placed Harvey in the\r\nleading boat, with orders to pilot the flotilla of the expedition to its\r\ndestination.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Pennamites Humiliatingly Defeated by\r\n                       Yankees, December 25, 1775\r\n\r\n\r\nOn December 20, the very day on which Congress adopted resolutions\r\ncalling on Pennsylvania and Connecticut to cease armed conflict during\r\nthe period of the Revolution, it was learned by the Yankee scouts that\r\nColonel William Plunket and the Pennamites had pushed their flotilla up\r\nthe North Branch of the Susquehanna River as far as the mouth of\r\nNescopeck Creek, about nineteen miles below Nanticoke Falls, but that\r\nthey were advancing slowly on account of the snow, which was then\r\nfalling, and the ice which was gathering on the river.\r\n\r\nColonel Zebulon Butler quickly mustered his available force, which\r\nnumbered about 400 men and boys, on Saturday, December 23, and marched\r\nto the left bank of Harvey’s Creek, where he encamped for the night on a\r\nlevel stretch of land near the river.\r\n\r\nThe vanguard of Colonel Plunket’s expedition arrived at “Harvey’s\r\nLanding” shortly after the Yankees had gone into camp above Harvey’s\r\nCreek.\r\n\r\nMajor John Garrett was dispatched under a flag of truce to Colonel\r\nPlunket to ascertain the meaning of his approach with armed militia. The\r\nanswer returned to Colonel Butler was that he came peaceably as an\r\nattendant to Sheriff Scull, who was authorized to arrest several persons\r\nat Wyoming for violating the laws of Pennsylvania, and he trusted there\r\nwould be no opposition to a measure so reasonable and pacific. Major\r\nGarrett reported to Colonel Butler and advised him of the strength of\r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\nColonel Butler early Sunday morning (December 24) dispatched Ensign\r\nMason F. Alden with a detail of eighteen men to remain on guard at\r\nHarvey’s Creek. Captain Lazarus Stewart, with twenty men, was detached\r\nto the east side of the river, above Nanticoke Falls, with orders to lie\r\nin ambush and prevent the landing on that shore of any boat’s crew.\r\n\r\nColonel Butler, with the remainder of his force, then retired up the\r\nriver about a mile to a point of natural defense on the plantation of\r\nBenjamin Harvey, Sr., where a precipitous ledge of rocks extends from\r\nthe Shawanese Mountains in a southerly direction almost to the bank of\r\nthe river, a distance of nearly half a mile. The Yankees took up their\r\nposition in this rocky rampart, and wherever it was defective for their\r\ndefense they erected breastworks of logs and stones.\r\n\r\nLater in the morning of Sunday about 11 o’clock, Ensign Alden, being\r\napprised at the mouth of Harvey’s Creek of the approach of the Plunket\r\nexpedition, retired with his men up the river and joined Colonel Butler.\r\n\r\nDeploying his column on the flat just abandoned by the Yankees, Plunket\r\ndirected a spirited advance in pursuit of Alden, not doubting but that\r\nthe main force of the settlers was near and that the hour of conflict\r\nhad arrived. In less than thirty minutes the advancing line was halted\r\nby Colonel Plunket, who exclaimed, “My God! What a breastwork!”\r\n\r\nScarcely had those words been uttered when there came a discharge of\r\nmusketry, crackling from end to end of the long-extended rampart, and\r\ngiving no uncertain notice that the unlooked-for barricade was\r\ngarrisoned.\r\n\r\nOne of Plunket’s men, Hugh McWilliams, was killed and three others\r\nwounded, while the whole body of Pennamites was thrown into great\r\nconfusion and without returning the fire of the Yankees immediately\r\nretreated to Harvey’s Creek.\r\n\r\nThey then brought two of their boats from Harvey’s Landing past\r\nNanticoke Falls by land and made preparations to cross the river in\r\ndetachments, in order to march by way of the eastern shore against the\r\nvillage of Wyoming, the objective point of the expedition.\r\n\r\nAfter nightfall the boats, well filled with soldiers, started across the\r\nriver some distance above the falls. In the bow of the first boat sat\r\nBenjamin Harvey, still held a prisoner by the Pennamites, and acting as\r\npilot under compulsion, while Colonel Plunket himself occupied a place\r\nin the second boat.\r\n\r\nWhen the boats nearly reached the opposite shore they were, without\r\nwarning, fired upon by Captain Lazarus Stewart and his men, who were\r\nconcealed in the thick brush on the river’s bank.\r\n\r\nTwo or three men in the first boat were wounded, one of whom, Jesse\r\nLukens, subsequently died. All the occupants of the boat would have been\r\nkilled, probably, had not Harvey made his presence known to the Yankees.\r\nThe boats were hurriedly backed astern, whereby they safely shot through\r\nthe rifles and into the pool at Harvey’s Landing. Thus ended the\r\noccurrences of Sunday.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning of Monday, which was Christmas, the Pennamites were\r\nastir. Colonel Plunket formed his men and marched them into two\r\ndivisions toward the breastworks held by the Yankees. While one division\r\nstormed the works, the other ascended the mountain on their left in an\r\nattempt to turn the right flank of Colonel Butler’s defenders.\r\n\r\nThe conflict lasted, with frequent cessations, during the greater part\r\nof the day, and on the part of the Yankees three or four men were killed\r\nand three times as many more wounded. Toward the close of the day\r\nColonel Plunket realized that the position of the Yankees was too strong\r\nto be carried by assault and he ordered a retreat down the west side of\r\nthe river.\r\n\r\nIn this movement he was closely pursued by Captain Stewart and his party\r\non the east side of the river, who determined, if possible, to capture\r\nat least one of the boats of the Pennamites. But Harvey, who was still a\r\nprisoner, called to them not to fire. So the expedition was permitted to\r\nfloat peaceably downstream toward Fort Augusta.\r\n\r\nColonel Zebulon Butler reported the battle to the Connecticut\r\nauthorities under date of December 27, 1775, and stated the losses among\r\nthe Plunket forces to have been fifty or sixty dead and wounded and that\r\ntwo were killed and three wounded of his own party and that one had\r\nsince died.\r\n\r\nThe Pennamites reported the affair quite differently. William Scull, the\r\nSheriff; Samuel Harris, Coroner; William Plunket, Samuel Hunter, Michael\r\nTroy and John Weitzel, Justices, wrote to Governor Penn under date\r\nSunbury, December 30, 1775, in which they related the expedition as one\r\nto serve legal processes. They blamed the Yankees for firing upon the\r\nSheriff’s posse without warning, and even with firing on the wounded as\r\nthey retreated down the river.\r\n\r\nThe Governor transmitted this letter to the Provincial Assembly and\r\nasked them to pay the bills.\r\n\r\nFour days after the battle the inhabitants of Westmoreland assembled in\r\ntown meeting, elected officers and appointed a committee to repair to\r\nPhiladelphia to “lay before the Honorable Continental Congress an\r\naccount of the late invasion made by the Tory Party of the Pennsylvania\r\npeople.” It was also voted to collect funds for three women whose\r\nhusbands were killed in the battle.\r\n\r\nJesse Lukens, who lost his life in this ill-fated expedition, was a\r\nyoung man of much promise, the son of John Lukens, who was the Surveyor\r\nGeneral of Pennsylvania from 1769 till his death in 1789. Jesse was born\r\nAugust 8, 1748, and had only recently arrived at Sunbury on a vacation\r\nand joined the Plunket expedition as a lark.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Pennsylvania Militia in Battle of Trenton,\r\n                           December 26, 1776\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in the Revolution Pennsylvania began to suffer severe losses. Each\r\nof the battalions organized at the request of Congress had been sent\r\nimmediately to the front, some to Canada, some to the defense of the\r\nHudson, and the balance with the main army.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1776 the necessities of the Continental service\r\nwere such that the Council of Safety of Pennsylvania placed the State\r\nbattalions under Colonels Samuel Miles, Samuel J. Atlee and Daniel\r\nBrodhead at the disposal of Congress. These were marched to Long Island,\r\nwhere, with the Continental Regiments of the Pennsylvania Line, viz:\r\nColonel Shee’s, Magaw’s and Lambert Cadwalader’s, they were engaged in\r\nbattle August 27, which resulted in the defeat of the American forces\r\nand the evacuation of Long Island. The Pennsylvanians sustained severe\r\nloss. Lieutenant Colonel Caleb Perry and other officers were killed.\r\nColonel Miles, Colonel Atlee and Lieutenant Colonel James Piper were\r\namong the many taken prisoners.\r\n\r\nFort Washington was reduced November 16 and again Pennsylvania lost\r\nheavily and the battalions of Morgan, Cadwalader, Atlee, Swope, Watts\r\nand Montgomery were taken prisoners, and, in addition to those losses,\r\nHowe was menacing Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nCongress made a precipitate adjournment in Philadelphia and removed to\r\nBaltimore. General Washington dispatched Major General Israel Putnam to\r\nPhiladelphia to direct the defense of that place. He arrived December\r\n12, and assumed military command of the city. The fort at Billingsport\r\nwas of little consequence, and works were commenced at Red Bank, N. J.\r\n\r\nGeneral Howe returned for winter quarters in New York, leaving British\r\ntroops at Trenton and Burlington, which threatened Philadelphia from the\r\neast side of the Delaware. The Americans had brigades under Lord\r\nStirling and Generals Mercer, Stephen and De Fermoy, at the several\r\nferries from Coryells (New Hope) to Yardleys. General Ewing was farther\r\nsouth with the Pennsylvania Flying Camp. Philemon Dickinson’s troops\r\nwere opposite Bordentown, Cadwalader’s were near Bristol, and Colonel\r\nNixon’s Third Pennsylvania Battalion was at Dunks Ferry.\r\n\r\nOn December 25 Colonel John Cadwalader and Colonel Samuel Miles, who was\r\nthen a prisoner of war, were appointed by Pennsylvania to be brigadier\r\ngenerals.\r\n\r\nGeneral Washington, with his army, was on the west bank of the Delaware,\r\nencamped near Taylorsville, then McConkeys Ferry, eight miles above\r\nTrenton.\r\n\r\nWhen Washington matured his plans to cross the Delaware River above the\r\nfalls at Trenton with his main army, the two smaller divisions, under\r\nGenerals Ewing and Cadwalader were ordered to cross at the same time at\r\npoints lower down the shore. Cadwalader could not pass through the ice,\r\nbut finally got across on the 27th from Bristol and remained on the\r\nJersey side, the troops from Burlington having retreated. Ewing’s\r\ncommand crossed on the 28th and 29th and took possession at Bordentown.\r\n\r\nGeneral Washington made the crossing on Christmas night, and the morning\r\nof the 26th took Trenton with more than 900 prisoners: General Rall, who\r\ncommanded the Hessians, was mortally wounded in the engagement.\r\n\r\nGeneral Washington thought it best to get back to the Pennsylvania side\r\nand before night had crossed with his forces, prisoners and other\r\ntrophies of victory. But in several days he crossed again and joined the\r\ndivisions of Cadwalader and Ewing. Mifflin brought to Bordentown 1800\r\nrecruits from Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe British were alarmed by the blow at Trenton and broke up their\r\nencampments along the Delaware, and retired to Princeton. Washington\r\nthereupon reoccupied Trenton, where he was speedily joined by\r\nPennsylvania Militia.\r\n\r\nOn January 3, 1777, Washington made an attack on Princeton. This battle\r\nwas sharp and decisive. Mercer’s forces were furiously attacked with the\r\ndeadly bayonet, and they fled in disorder. The enemy pursued until, on\r\nthe brow of a hill, they discovered the American regulars and\r\nPennsylvania Militia, under Washington, marching to the support of\r\nMercer, who, in trying to rally his men, had his horse disabled under\r\nhim, and was finally knocked down by a clubbed musket and mortally\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\nWashington checked the flight and intercepted the British who were in\r\npursuit. In this action the Pennsylvania militia bore the brunt of the\r\nattack, and but for the personal leadership of General Washington and\r\nthe timely arrival of reinforcements, would have been compelled to yield\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\nIn this short but sharp battle the British lost in killed, wounded and\r\nprisoners about 430 men. The American loss was about 100, including\r\nColonels Haslet and James Potter, Major Morris and Captains Shippen,\r\nFleming and Neal. General Hugh Mercer died nine days after the battle.\r\n\r\nHere General Cadwalader distinguished himself as an able and brave\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\nWashington in his report to the president of Congress alluded to General\r\nCadwalader as “a man of ability, a good disciplinarian and a man of good\r\nprinciple and of intrepid bravery.”\r\n\r\nChief Justice John Marshall, who was at that time an officer in the\r\narmy, in a letter speaks of General Cadwalader’s “activity, talents and\r\nzeal.”\r\n\r\nGeneral Joseph Reed in a letter to the President of Pennsylvania, dated\r\nMorristown, January 24, 1777, said: “General Cadwalader has conducted\r\nhis command with great honor to himself and the province; all the field\r\nofficers supported their character; their example was followed by the\r\ninferior officers and men; so they have returned with the thanks of\r\nevery general officer of the army.”\r\n\r\nIt was also in the Battle of Princeton that the Philadelphia City Troop,\r\nunder command of Captain Samuel Morris, and the company of marines under\r\nCaptain William Brown, belonging to the Pennsylvania ship Montgomery,\r\ndistinguished themselves by their bravery.\r\n\r\nCornwallis was about to sail for England when the Battle of Trenton took\r\nplace, and Howe detained him and rushed him to take command of the\r\ntroops at Princeton. When he arrived there Washington and his little\r\narmy and prisoners were far on their way in pursuit of two British\r\nregiments.\r\n\r\nOn account of the fatigue of his soldiers, Washington gave up this chase\r\nand moved into winter quarters at Morristown, N. J.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Frederick the Great of Prussia declared that the\r\nachievements of Washington and his little band of patriots between\r\nDecember 25, 1776, and January 4, 1777, were the most brilliant of any\r\nrecorded in military history.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Paxtang Boys Wipe Out Conestoga Indians\r\n                          on December 27, 1763\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was during the Pontiac War that Governor James Hamilton, in reply to\r\nearnest appeals for help and protection, said he could give the\r\nfrontiersmen no aid whatever. Neither the Governor nor the Assembly\r\nshowed the proper spirit. It was a time when the tomahawk, the scalping\r\nknife and the torch were desolating the frontiers of the Province.\r\n\r\nThe Indians set fire to houses, barns, corn, hay, in short, to\r\neverything that was combustible, so that the whole frontier seemed to be\r\none general blaze. Great numbers of back inhabitants were murdered in\r\nthe most shocking manner and their dead bodies inhumanly mangled.\r\n\r\nPaxtang, near what is now Harrisburg, became truly the frontier, for\r\nwest of the Susquehanna so great was the terror that scarcely an\r\ninhabitant was left. At this juncture the Reverend John Elder, the\r\nrevered pastor of the Paxton Presbyterian Church, at Paxtang, organized\r\nhis rangers under authority of the Provincial Government. They were\r\nmostly members of his own and the Hanover congregations.\r\n\r\nThese brave men were ever on the alert, watching with eagle eye the\r\nIndian marauders. The Paxtang rangers were truly the terror of the red\r\nmen, swift on foot, excellent horsemen, good shots, skillful in pursuit\r\nor in escape, dexterous as scouts, and expert in maneuvering.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1763, Colonel John Armstrong, the “hero of Kittanning,” with\r\n200 Paxtang and Hanover rangers and some soldiers from Cumberland\r\nCounty, marched to the Indian town at Great Island (now Lock Haven).\r\nSeveral skirmishes were fought, and some killed in the Muncy Hills.\r\nThese volunteers returned home enraged at learning that the Conestoga\r\nIndians had sent messengers to inform their friends of the expedition.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, on September 9, 1763, the rangers who were scouting in\r\nBerks County, were apprised by their out-scouts of the approach of\r\nIndians. The savages intended to take the rangers by surprise, and\r\nduring a short engagement, it was discovered these Indians were from the\r\nMoravian settlement in Northampton County. The “Paxtang Boys” were\r\ndetermined to ascertain the treacherous.\r\n\r\nIn October occurred the murder of the Stinson family and others; the\r\nPaxtang men solicited their colonel to make an excursion against the\r\nenemy. The first massacre at Wyoming occurred October 15. Two companies\r\nin command of Captain Lazarus Stewart and Captain Asher Clayton were\r\nsent by Colonel Elder to Wyoming. Upon their arrival they learned first\r\nhanded of the awful outrages committed by the bloodthirsty savages under\r\n“Captain Bull.”\r\n\r\nIndians had been traced by these scouts to the wigwams at Conestoga, and\r\nsome to those of the Moravian Indians at Nain and Wichetunk. The rangers\r\ninsisted on captivating the murderers but the merciful colonel dissuaded\r\nthem. It was then that Colonel Elder advised Governor Hamilton to remove\r\nthe Indians from Conestoga.\r\n\r\nColonel Timothy Green wrote to the Governor: “We live in daily fear of\r\nour lives. At the Indian town the incarnate devils are secreted, and the\r\npeople here demand that those Indians be removed from among us.”\r\n\r\nJohn Harris wrote: “I hope Your Honor will be pleased to cause these\r\nIndians to be removed to some other place, as I don’t like their\r\ncompany.”\r\n\r\nGovernor Penn replied: “The Indians of Conestoga have been\r\nmisrepresented as innocent, helpless and dependent on this Government\r\nfor support. The faith of this Government is pledged for their\r\nprotection. I cannot remove them without adequate cause.”\r\n\r\nThe rangers resolved on taking the law into their own hands. The\r\ndestruction of the Conestoga Indians was not then projected. That was\r\nthe result. Colonel Elder approved the capture of the most notorious\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nThe “Paxtang Boys” reached the Indian settlement about daybreak, when\r\nthe barking of a dog made their approach known. The Indians rushed from\r\ntheir wigwams, brandishing their tomahawks. This show of resistance was\r\nsufficient excuse for the rangers to make use of their guns.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes every Indian fell before the unerring fire of the brave\r\nfrontiersmen. Unfortunately a number of Indians were absent from\r\nConestoga, prowling about the neighboring settlement.\r\n\r\nSoon as this attack was known some Indians were placed in the Lancaster\r\nworkhouse and several, well known to Parson Elder’s scouts, were hurried\r\nto Philadelphia, where they were secreted among the Moravian Indians\r\nprotected in that city.\r\n\r\nGovernor Penn did not act with dispatch in removing the Indians from\r\nLancaster, nor did he seem to care for them.\r\n\r\nThe “Paxtang Boys” realized their work was only half done. Captain\r\nStewart proposed they capture the principal Indian outlaw, in the\r\nLancaster workhouse, and take him to Carlisle jail, where he could be\r\nheld for trial. This plan was heartily approved and fifty of the\r\n“Paxtang Boys” proceeded to Lancaster on December 27, broke into the\r\nworkhouse, and but for the show of resistance would have effected their\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nBut the rangers were so enraged at the defiance of the Indians that\r\nbefore they could be repressed the last of the so-called Conestoga\r\nIndians had yielded up his life. In a few minutes the daring rangers\r\nwere safe from pursuit.\r\n\r\nThe excitement throughout the Province was great. No language could\r\ndescribe the outcry which arose from the Quakers in Philadelphia, or the\r\nexcitement along the frontiers.\r\n\r\nFears were entertained for the safety of the Moravian Indian converts,\r\nand they were removed to Philadelphia and lodged in the city barracks.\r\n\r\nThis open and avowed protection of the Indians exasperated the\r\nfrontiersmen, and they started for Philadelphia with the avowed purpose\r\nof killing the Indians and punishing the Quakers.\r\n\r\nThe city was greatly alarmed. Military companies were organized. Even\r\nthe staid, reverent, peaceful Quakers shouldered guns and drilled. The\r\nwildest rumors were current as to the numbers and anger of the\r\nScotch-Irish.\r\n\r\nBut the “Paxtang Boys” when they learned the effective measures for\r\nprotection taken in the city, halted their march at Germantown. A\r\ndelegation of leading men composed of Benjamin Franklin, Israel\r\nPemberton and Joseph Galloway was sent by Governor Penn to meet the\r\ninsurgents and hear their grievances.\r\n\r\nThe “Paxtang Boys” presented their side, and left a committee consisting\r\nof Captain Matthew Smith, afterward vice president of the State, and\r\nJames Gibson, to accompany the Provincial Commissioners to Philadelphia,\r\nwhere they met the Governor and the Assembly, to whom they presented\r\ntheir grievances in the form of a declaration. The remaining members of\r\nthe party returned to their homes, and the inhabitants of the city to\r\ntheir peaceful avocations. And thus ended the “Paxtang Boys’\r\nInsurrection.”\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Benjamin Franklin Presents Treaty Plan to\r\n                   King of France, December 28, 1776\r\n\r\n\r\nSo soon as the idea of independence had taken the practical shape of a\r\nresolution and declaration adopted by the Continental Congress, the\r\nAmericans began to contemplate the necessity of foreign aid, material\r\nand moral. Congress appointed a Secret Committee of Correspondence for\r\nthe purpose and sent Silas Deane, of Connecticut, upon a\r\nhalf-commercial, half-diplomatic mission to France.\r\n\r\nFranklin was at first opposed to seeking foreign alliances. “A virgin\r\nstate,” he said, “should preserve the virgin character, and not go about\r\nsuitoring for alliance, but wait with decent dignity for the application\r\nof others.”\r\n\r\nBut Franklin soon became chief suitor in Europe.\r\n\r\nLater in the autumn of 1776 Dr. Franklin was sent by the Continental\r\nCongress as a diplomatic agent to France. He sailed in the ship\r\nReprisal. The passage occupied thirty days during which that vessel had\r\nbeen chased by British cruisers and had taken two British brigantines as\r\nprizes.\r\n\r\nFranklin landed at Nantes, December 7. Europe was not prepared for his\r\narrival, having had no advance notice of his coming and the event was in\r\nconsequence one of great surprise. By this time Franklin’s fame was\r\nworld-wide.\r\n\r\nThe courts were filled with conjectures, and in England the story was\r\ncurrent that Dr. Franklin was a fugitive for his own personal safety.\r\nBurke said, “I never will believe that he is going to conclude a long\r\nlife, which has brightened every hour it has continued, with so foul and\r\ndishonorable a flight.”\r\n\r\nOn the Continent it was concluded that he was in Europe on a most\r\nimportant mission. To the French he spoke frankly, saying that twenty\r\nsuccessful campaigns could not subdue the Americans, that their decision\r\nfor independence was irrevocable and that they would be forever\r\nindependent states.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of December 28, Franklin, with the other\r\ncommissioners—Silas Deane, of Connecticut, and Arthur Lee, of\r\nVirginia—waited upon Vergennes, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs,\r\nwhen he presented the plan as suggested by the Continental Congress for\r\na treaty, by which it was hoped the states might obtain their\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners were instructed to press for an immediate declaration\r\nof the French Government in favor of the Americans. Knowing the desire\r\nof the French to widen the breach and cause a dismemberment of the\r\nBritish Empire, the Commissioners were to intimate that a reunion of the\r\nColonies with Great Britain might be the consequence of delay.\r\n\r\nVergennes spoke of the attachment of the French nation to the American\r\ncause and requested a paper from Dr. Franklin upon the condition of\r\nAmerica and that in the future intercourse with the sage might be in\r\nsecret, without the intervention of a third person. Personal friendship\r\nbetween these two distinguished men became strong and abiding.\r\n\r\nThe French Minister told Franklin that as Spain and France were in\r\nperfect accord, he might communicate freely with the Spanish Minister,\r\nthe Count de Aranda.\r\n\r\nWith him Franklin, Deane and Lee held secret but barren interviews, for\r\nSpain was quite indifferent. Aranda would only promise the freedom of\r\nSpanish ports to American vessels.\r\n\r\nAs for France, she was at that time unwilling to incur the risk of war\r\nwith Great Britain, but when the defeat and surrender of Burgoyne was\r\nmade known at Versailles late in 1777, and assured thereby that the\r\nAmerican Colonies could help themselves, the French Court was ready to\r\nlisten to Franklin. To him was chiefly due the successful negotiation of\r\nthe treaty of alliance which meant so much to the American cause at that\r\ncritical period in the War for Independence.\r\n\r\nThe presence of an agent of the British Ministry in Paris, on social\r\nterms with the American Commissioners, hastened the negotiations, and\r\nFebruary, 1778, two treaties were secretly signed at Paris by the\r\nAmerican Commissioners and the Count de Vergennes on the part of France.\r\nOne was a commercial agreement, the other an alliance contingent on the\r\nbreaking out of hostilities between France and Great Britain.\r\n\r\nIt was stipulated in the treaty of alliance that peace should not be\r\nmade until the mercantile and political independence of the United\r\nStates should be secured.\r\n\r\nFranklin continued to represent the States in France until 1785, when he\r\nreturned home. He took an important part in the negotiations for peace.\r\nIn 1786 he was elected Governor of Pennsylvania; and, in 1787 he was the\r\nleading member in the convention which framed the National Constitution.\r\n\r\nDr. Franklin had deserved confidence in his ability and honesty. To\r\nSilas Deane was intrusted the receipt and expenditure of money by the\r\nCommissioners to France. The jealous, querulous Arthur Lee, who was the\r\nthird Commissioner, soon made trouble.\r\n\r\nLee wrote letters to his brother in Congress (Richard Henry Lee), in\r\nwhich he made many insinuations against both his colleagues. Ralph\r\nIzard, of South Carolina, Commissioner to the Grand Duke of Tuscany, who\r\nfelt offended because he was not consulted about the treaty with France,\r\nwhen he also was in Paris, sent home similar letters to those of Lee.\r\n\r\nWilliam Carmichael, of Maryland, a secretary of the Commissioners, who\r\nhad returned to Philadelphia, insinuated in Congress that Deane had\r\nappropriated the public money to his own use. Deane was recalled.\r\n\r\nOut of this incident sprang two violent parties. Robert Morris, of\r\nPhiladelphia, and other members of Congress, who were commercial\r\nexperts, took the side of Deane, and Richard Henry Lee, then chairman of\r\nthe Committee on Foreign Affairs, opposed him.\r\n\r\nDeane published in the Philadelphia Gazette an “Address to the People of\r\nthe United States,” in which he referred to the brothers Lee with much\r\nseverity and claiming for himself the credit of obtaining supplies from\r\nFrance through Beaumarchais. Thomas Paine replied to Deane, making use\r\nof public documents in his charge.\r\n\r\nThe statement called out loud complaints from the French Minister and\r\nPaine’s indiscretion cost him his place as secretary of the Committee on\r\nForeign Affairs.\r\n\r\nThis discussion among diplomatic agents soon led to the recall of all of\r\nthem except Franklin, who remained sole Minister at the French Court.\r\n\r\nFranklin testified to Deane’s strict honesty and private worth, but\r\nArthur Lee had the ear of Congress, and Deane had to suffer. He died in\r\nobscurity and poverty at Deal, England, August 23, 1789. He has since\r\nbeen vindicated and all unjust suspicions have been removed, thus\r\nconfirming the judgment of the wise Franklin.\r\n\r\nFrom Franklin’s advent in the French Court, December 28, 1776, until he\r\nsailed for his home in Philadelphia, in 1785, he was held in the high\r\nesteem which his talents, experience and personality entitled him.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Franklin Begins Building Chain of Forts on\r\n                           December 29, 1755\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernor Robert Hunter Morris summoned the Provincial Assembly for\r\nNovember 3, 1755, when he laid before them an account of the\r\ndepredations committed by the enemy, and demanded money and a militia\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nPetitions began to pour in from all parts of the Province; from the\r\nfrontier counties praying for arms and munitions; from the middle\r\ncounties, deprecating further resistance to the views of the Governor,\r\nand urging, if necessary, a sacrifice of property for the better defense\r\nof their lives. All wished that the religious scruples of the members of\r\nthe Assembly might no longer prevent the better defense of the Province.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of November, and while the Assembly was receiving these\r\npetitions, the Indians entered the passes of the Blue Mountains and\r\nbroke into the Counties of Lancaster, Berks and Northampton, committing\r\nmurder, devastation and every other kind of horrid mischief, and yet the\r\nAssembly debated and debated the measures for defense.\r\n\r\nThe Governor, wearied with this delay, sent a message requesting the\r\nAssembly to strengthen his hands and afford assistance to the back\r\ninhabitants, but this time they made the excuse that in so doing they\r\nmight alienate the affections of the Indians, and to a large degree\r\nrefused to grant the means necessary for the protection of the\r\nfrontiers. This was truly an unfortunate position.\r\n\r\nBut at this time the alarming news of Braddock’s defeat reached the\r\nproprietaries in England, and they came forward with a donation of £5000\r\nfor defense, to be collected from arrears in quit-rents; but they\r\nrefused to grant it on any other ground than as a free gift. The\r\nAssembly waived their rights for a time, in consideration of the\r\ndistressed state of the Province, and passed a bill to strike £30,000 in\r\nbills of credit, based upon the excise. This bill was approved by\r\nGovernor Morris.\r\n\r\nThe population of the Province was not yet satisfied with the cold\r\nindifference of the Assembly at such a crisis and throughout all the\r\ncounties there were indignant protests. Public meetings were held\r\nthroughout Lancaster and the frontier counties, at which it was resolved\r\nthat the people should “repair to Philadelphia and compel the provincial\r\nauthorities to pass proper laws to defend the country and oppose the\r\nenemy.”\r\n\r\nIn addition, the dead bodies of some of the murdered and mangled were\r\nsent to Philadelphia and hauled about the streets with placards\r\nannouncing that they were victims of the Quaker policy of nonresistance.\r\n\r\nA large and threatening mob surrounded the House of Assembly, placed the\r\ndead bodies of their neighbors in the doorway and demanded immediate\r\nrelief for the people of the frontiers. Such indeed were the desperate\r\nmeasures resorted to in their effort to obtain better defense.\r\n\r\nOne of the results of these demonstrative measures and the protests of\r\nthe people was the erection of a chain of forts and block-houses. These\r\nwere designed to guard against the Indian incursions and were erected by\r\nthe Province, at a cost of £85,000.\r\n\r\nThis chain extended from along the Kittatinny Hills, near where\r\nStroudsburg now stands, southeasterly through the Province, to the\r\nMaryland line. They were constructed at the important passes of the\r\nmountains and at important places, almost equi-distant, so that they\r\nwould the better serve as havens of refuge when attacked suddenly.\r\n\r\nThese forts were garrisoned by troops in the pay of the Province, twenty\r\nto seventy-five men always under the command of a commissioned officer.\r\nEven the Moravians at Bethlehem cheerfully fortified their town and took\r\nup arms in self-defense.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Franklin and James Hamilton were selected to repair to the\r\nforks of the Delaware and raise troops for the execution of the plan.\r\nThey arrived at Easton, December 29, and appointed William Parsons to be\r\nmajor of the troops to be raised in Northampton County.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Captain Hays, with his company from the Irish\r\nSettlement, in that county, had been ordered to New Gnadenhutten, which\r\nhad recently been the scene of an Indian raid, in which they applied the\r\ntorch, many being burned to death and others escaped to Bethlehem in\r\ntheir nightclothes in the cold winter air.\r\n\r\nThe troops erected a temporary stockade and a garrison was placed there\r\nto guard the Brethren’s mills, which were filled with grain, and to\r\nprotect the few settlers who had the hardihood to return and again\r\nsettle there.\r\n\r\nCaptain Hay’s detachment was attacked on New Year’s Day, 1756, while\r\nsome of the troops were amusing themselves skating on the ice of the\r\nriver, near the stockade. They noticed some Indians in the distance and\r\nthinking it an easy matter to capture or kill them the soldiers gave\r\nchase, and rapidly gained on these Indians, who proved to be decoys\r\nskilfully maneuvering to draw the untrained Indian fighters into an\r\nambuscade.\r\n\r\nAfter the troops had gone some distance a party of Indians rushed out\r\nbehind them, cut off their retreat and, falling upon them with great\r\nfury, as well as with the advantage of surprise and superior numbers,\r\nquickly dispatched them. Some of the soldiers, remaining in the\r\nstockade, filled with terror by the murder of their comrades, deserted,\r\nand the few remaining thinking themselves incapable of defending the\r\nplace, withdrew.\r\n\r\nThe savages then seized upon such property as they could use and set\r\nfire to the stockade, the Indians’ houses and the Brethren’s mills.\r\nSeven farm houses between Gnadenhutten and Nazareth were burned by those\r\nsame Indians, who also murdered such of the people as they discovered.\r\n\r\nThis incursion was the inception of Fort Allen. It seems that “it was\r\nthe intention to build a fort at New Gnadenhutten, and Colonel Franklin\r\nstarted to Bethlehem to carry that plan into operation.” But the\r\nsituation required him to change his plans and he marched to what is now\r\nWeissport, in Carbon County, and there erected Fort Allen. The site of\r\nthis provincial fort is now occupied by Fort Allen Hotel. The old well\r\nis still in existence.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly requested Franklin’s appearance and when he responded to\r\nthis call he turned his command over to Colonel William Clapham.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that the chain of forts began with Fort Dupui,\r\nbuilt on the property of Samuel Dupui, a Huguenot settler, in the\r\npresent town of Shawnee, on the Delaware River, five and one-half miles\r\nfrom the present town of Stroudsburg. Then Fort Hamilton was built on\r\nthe present site of Stroudsburg, where Fort Penn was also in the eastern\r\npart of the town. These forts were in the heart of the territory which\r\nthe Minsink, or Munsee, Indians occupied.\r\n\r\nFort Norris came next in the chain and was near Greensweig’s, Monroe\r\nCounty, and fifteen miles west was Fort Allen, and then Fort Franklin,\r\nin Albany Township, Berks County, and nineteen miles west was Fort\r\nLebanon, also known as Fort William, about a mile and a half from the\r\npresent town of Auburn, a short distance from Port Clinton. The next in\r\nthe chain was the small fort at Deitrick Six’s, then Fort Henry; then\r\nFort Swatara, both described in former stories, and then Fort Hunter,\r\nsix miles above Harrisburg, and Fort Halifax, both on the Susquehanna\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\nCrossing the river was Fort Patterson, in the Tuscarora Valley, opposite\r\nMexico, Juniata County; Fort Granville, near Lewistown; Fort Shirley,\r\nnear Aughwick Creek; Fort Lyttleton, at Sugar Cabins, and Fort McDowell,\r\nin Franklin County, the last of the line in the Province of\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Mason and Dixon Determined Starting Point\r\n                 for Boundary Survey, December 30, 1763\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dispute over the boundary of the province on the south began with\r\nthe acquisition of the charter and continued through the life of William\r\nPenn and his descendants, until almost the end of Proprietary Government\r\nin Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nCharles Calvert, the fifth Lord Baltimore, drew an agreement, defining\r\nthe boundaries between Maryland and Delaware and Maryland and\r\nPennsylvania. On May 10, 1732, John and Thomas Penn agreed to this and\r\nsigned the instrument. John Penn and Lord Baltimore then came to\r\nAmerica, and, Baltimore changed his mind and caused every possible delay\r\nin having a survey made of this disputed line.\r\n\r\nCommissioners had been appointed by both governments and they did\r\nnothing but wrangle for the eighteen months allowed in the agreement,\r\nand Baltimore believed this made it of no effect.\r\n\r\nThe Penn family won in court and the conduct of Baltimore was censured.\r\n\r\nFrederick, the sixth Lord Baltimore, declined to be bound by any act of\r\nhis predecessors, and again many years were wasted.\r\n\r\nIn 1760 a new agreement was made which was practically identical with\r\nthe one of 1732. Commissioners on the part of Pennsylvania were the\r\nGovernor, James Hamilton, Richard Peters, Reverend Dr. Ewing, William\r\nAllen, William Coleman, Thomas Willing, Benjamin Clew, and Edward\r\nShippen, Jr., a selection which assured good and faithful performance.\r\n\r\nThe first three years were spent by the surveyors employed in marking\r\nthe lines of Delaware. The circle around New Castle was drawn by David\r\nRittenhouse, and added much to his reputation.\r\n\r\nThis work proceeded too slowly and on August 4, 1763, Thomas and Richard\r\nPenn, and Frederick, Lord Baltimore, then being together in London,\r\nagreed with Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon, two well known English\r\nastronomers, “to mark, run out, settle, fix, and determine all such\r\nparts of the circle, marks, lines, and boundaries, as were mentioned in\r\nthe several articles or commissions, and were not yet completed.”\r\n\r\nMason and Dixon arrived in Philadelphia, November 15, 1763, and\r\nforthwith engaged in work.\r\n\r\nThey began their survey by ascertaining the latitude of the southernmost\r\npart of the City of Philadelphia, which they agreed was the north wall\r\nof the house then occupied by Thomas Plumstead and Joseph Huddle, on the\r\nsouth side of Cedar Street. They determined it was 39° 56' 37.4”. This\r\nwas ascertained December 30, 1763, and the actual survey of the boundary\r\nline properly began on this date.\r\n\r\nDuring January and February, 1764, they measured thirty-one miles\r\nwestward of the city to the forks of the Brandywine, where they planted\r\na quartzose stone, six miles west of the meridian of the court house in\r\nWest Chester.\r\n\r\nWith this stone as a fixed point they determined the point from which\r\nthey should start to run the horizontal line of five degrees longitude\r\nto fix the southern boundary. This was of course the northeast corner of\r\nthe State of Maryland.\r\n\r\nFrom this point they extended the line 230 miles, eighteen chains, and\r\ntwenty-one links, or 244 miles, thirty-eight chains, and thirty-six\r\nlinks, from the Delaware River. This was done during 1766 and 1767.\r\n\r\nThe Indians could not understand the object of an exploring expedition\r\nthat spent every clear night gazing at the stars through big guns, and\r\nthey soon stopped their progress. The Penns used their influence with\r\nthe Indians and the work proceeded.\r\n\r\nThe western extremity of Maryland was reached and passed, and the\r\nastronomers were encamped on the banks of the Monongahela, when the\r\nIndians again interposed. Their attitude was so threatening that many of\r\nthe servants and workmen of the expedition deserted. But the great\r\ndelight and satisfaction of running an astronomical line through\r\nprimeval forests raised Mason and Dixon above all fears, and they\r\npressed on to the Warrior Branch of the great Catawba Indian trail.\r\n\r\nThis was on the borders of a stream called Dunkard Creek, about the\r\nmiddle point on the southern boundary line of the present Green County.\r\nHere the Indians took such a menacing stand that Mason and Dixon were\r\nobliged to return, and their Dunkard Creek trail, or Warrior trail,\r\nremained the terminus of their line for many years.\r\n\r\nThis Mason and Dixon’s line was a great achievement in that day, and a\r\nnew thing in science. These two modest but skillful men had made\r\nthemselves immortal. Their line was not marked by river, creek or even\r\nmountain range, it was an imaginary one. At every fifth mile a stone was\r\nset up marked on the northern side with the arms of the Penns and on the\r\nsouthern side with the arms of Baltimore, each intermediate mile was\r\nmarked with stones having P. on the one side and M. on the opposite\r\nside.\r\n\r\nThis line, fixed after nearly a hundred years of conflict, is more\r\nunalterable than if nature had originally made it. It became the\r\nboundary line between the great sides of the slavery question, and\r\ndivided the armies of the North and South in the great Civil War.\r\n\r\nThe interference of the Indians having arrested further work, Messrs.\r\nMason and Dixon returned to Philadelphia, where they reported to the\r\ncommissioner, and on December 26, 1767, received an honorable discharge.\r\n\r\nThere were many minor disturbances occasioned by this line, and the\r\nactions of the rough border population were slow to become satisfied. A\r\nsurveyor’s transit or astronomy was not enough to determine the limits\r\nof their civil pride. These people had grown accustomed to the temporary\r\nlines which had been run about 1740, which was about one-quarter of a\r\nmile above the true one, and they became as much excited over that\r\nnarrow strip as they had been when they hoped to penetrate miles into\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe government of Pennsylvania determined to acquire its rightful\r\njurisdiction and in 1774, a proclamation was issued, which has generally\r\nbeen considered the final act in the boundary controversy.\r\n\r\nThe residue of the southern boundary, a little less than twenty-two\r\nmiles, was run in 1782 by Robert Andrews, Andrew Ellicott, John Ewing,\r\nDavid Rittenhouse, and John Hutchins, and completed and permanently\r\nmarked in 1784.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   First Bank in America Chartered in\r\n                    Philadelphia, December 31, 1781\r\n\r\n\r\nCongress again assembled in Philadelphia on July 2, 1778, and on the 9th\r\nthe “Articles of Confederation,” engrossed on parchment, were signed by\r\nthe delegates of eight States.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania was one of those states which immediately acceded to the\r\nConfederation. The delegation from this State consisted of Benjamin\r\nFranklin, Robert Morris, Daniel Roderdeau, Jonathan Bayard Smith, James\r\nSmith, of Yorktown; William Clingan and Joseph Reed.\r\n\r\nThe “Articles of Confederation” were submitted to the several State\r\nLegislatures. Slowly the States ratified them, some of them pointing out\r\nserious defects, and all taking time to discuss them. The first State to\r\nratify, in addition to the eight which immediately signed, was North\r\nCarolina, July 21, but Maryland steadily refused until March 1, 1781,\r\nwhen the League of States was perfected.\r\n\r\nIt was soon perceived that under this new Government the Congress had no\r\npower, independent of the several States, to enforce taxation.\r\n\r\nRobert Morris, then Superintendent of Finance (Secretary of the\r\nTreasury), proposed the establishment of a bank in Philadelphia, to\r\nsupply the Government with money, with a capital of $400,000.\r\n\r\nThe promissory notes of the bank were to be a legal tender of currency,\r\nto be received in payment of all taxes, duties and debts due the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nBut before Congress could act the patriotic citizens of Philadelphia\r\nmoved for the establishment of a bank by which means the soldiers in the\r\nContinental Army could be supplied with provisions.\r\n\r\nA plan for this bank was prepared in Philadelphia which set forth the\r\nentire scheme of subscription and operation, down to the minutest\r\ndetail, even stating that the factor (cashier) “shall provide his store\r\nwith rum, sugar, coffee, salt and other goods at the cheapest price to\r\nthose who supply him with provisions, that he may gain a preference of\r\nwhat comes to market.” The provisions were to be purchased for the army\r\nin the field.\r\n\r\nThis plan named the original board of inspectors, Robert Morris, J. M.\r\nNesbitt, Blair M'Clenachan, Samuel Miles and Cadwallader Morris. The two\r\ndirectors were John Nixon and George Clymer and the factor was Tench\r\nFrancis.\r\n\r\nThe subscription list was headed:\r\n\r\n“Whereas, in the present situation of public affairs in the United\r\nStates, the greatest and most vigorous exertions are required for the\r\nsuccessful management of the just and necessary war in which they are\r\nengaged with Great Britain; We, the subscribers, deeply impressed with\r\nthe sentiments that on such an occasion should govern us, in the\r\nprosecution of a war, in the event of which, our own freedom and that of\r\nour posterity and the freedom and independence of the United States are\r\nall involved, hereby severally pledge our property and credit for the\r\nseveral sums specified and mentioned after our names, in order to\r\nsupport the credit of a bank to be established for furnishing a supply\r\nof provisions for the armies of the United States; and we do hereby\r\nseverally promise and engage to execute to the directors of the said\r\nbank bonds of the form hereunto annexed.\r\n\r\n“Witness our hands the 17th day of June, in the year of our Lord, 1780.”\r\n\r\nThere were ninety-two original patriot subscribers, the total pledges of\r\nwhom amounted to £300,000 Pennsylvania currency, payable in gold or\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\nRobert Morris and Blair McClenachan each subscribed £10,000; Bunner,\r\nMurray & Co., £6000; Tench Francis, £5500; James Wilson, George Clymer,\r\nWilliam Bingham, J. M. Nesbitt & Co., Richard Peters, Samuel Meredith,\r\nJames Mease, Thomas Barclay, Samuel Morris, Jr., John Cox, Robert L.\r\nHooper, Jr., Hugh Shiell, Samuel Eyre, Matthew Irwin, Thomas Irwin, John\r\nPhilip De Haas, Philip Moore, John Nixon, Robert Bridges, John Benezet,\r\nHenry Hill, John Morgan, Samuel Mifflin, Thomas Mifflin, Thomas Willing\r\nand Samuel Powell, each subscribed £5000.\r\n\r\nNone of the subscribers pledged less than £1000, and it is a question if\r\never a more liberal list of patriots could be found anywhere than this\r\none.\r\n\r\nThis bank opened its doors on July 17, 1780, in Front Street,\r\nPhiladelphia, two doors above Walnut.\r\n\r\nTo show the mode of doing business an old advertisement says: “All\r\npersons who have already lent money are desired to apply for bank notes;\r\nand the directors request the favor of those who may hereafter lodge\r\ntheir cash in the bank, that they would tie it up in bundles of bills of\r\none denomination, with labels, and their names indorsed, as the business\r\nwill thereby be done with less trouble and much greater dispatch.”\r\n\r\nThe bank continued in operation till the establishment of the Bank of\r\nNorth America, December 31, 1781, and was the first banking institution\r\nin America.\r\n\r\nThe plan for the bank for the Government was approved by the Continental\r\nCongress, May 26, 1781, and this financial agent of the Government was\r\nchartered by the Congress December 31, 1781. The capital stock was\r\ndivided into shares of $400 each, in money of gold and silver, to be\r\nprocured by subscriptions.\r\n\r\nTwelve directors were appointed to manage the affairs of the bank, which\r\nwas entitled by the Congress “The President, Directors and Company of\r\nthe Bank of North America.”\r\n\r\nAlexander Hamilton, observing the prosperity and usefulness to the\r\ncommercial community and the financial operations of the Government of\r\nthe Bank of North America, in Philadelphia, and of the Bank of New York,\r\nand the Bank of Massachusetts, which were afterward established, and\r\nwhich three banks held the entire banking capital of the country before\r\n1791, recommended the establishment of a Government bank in his famous\r\nreport on the finances (1790), as Secretary of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nHamilton’s suggestion was speedily acted upon, and an act for the\r\npurpose was adopted February 8, 1791.\r\n\r\nPresident Washington asked the written opinion of his Cabinet concerning\r\nits constitutionality. They were equally divided. The President,\r\nbelieving it legal, signed the bill.\r\n\r\nThe bank was named “The United States Bank” and its charter limited to\r\ntwenty years.\r\n\r\nThis bank was soon established, with a capital of $10,000,000, of which\r\namount the Government subscribed $2,000,000 in specie and $6,000,000 in\r\nstocks of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe measure was very popular. The shares of the bank rose to 25 and 45\r\nper cent premium, and it paid an average dividend of 8½ per cent on its\r\ncapital. The shares were $400 each, same as the Bank of North America.\r\n\r\nThe United States Bank was chartered February 25, 1791, and established\r\nat Philadelphia, with branches at different points. Its charter expired\r\nwithout renewal March 4, 1811.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX\r\n\r\n          A\r\n\r\n Aaronsburg Lottery, 276\r\n Abduction of Colonel Timothy Pickering, 438\r\n Abe Little, 236\r\n Abercrombie, Lieutenant Colonel James W., 307\r\n Abington, 736\r\n Abolition Society, 46, 114\r\n Abraham, 540\r\n Abraham, Heights of, 498\r\n Absentz, George, 284\r\n Academy, 45, 882\r\n Academy, Germantown, 283\r\n Academy of Music, 41\r\n Acrods, Benjamin, 190\r\n Adams County, 181, 218, 244, 264, 288, 416, 582, 596, 698, 811, 853\r\n Adams, John, 53, 139, 191, 200, 263, 383, 459, 789, 791, 816\r\n Adams, General John, 583\r\n Addison, Alexander, 605\r\n Address, Lincoln’s Gettysburg, Story, 810\r\n Adet, 789\r\n Adjouquay, 394\r\n Adler (of Reading), The, 191\r\n Adlum, John, 11, 731, 732\r\n Agnew, General James, 691\r\n Agriculture, Department of, 88\r\n Agrippa, Cornelius, 151\r\n Alabama, 8\r\n Advocate, 866\r\n Albany, 45, 491\r\n Albany Township, 918\r\n Albright, General Charles, 49, 109\r\n Alden, Mason F., 906\r\n Alexander, Captain Charles, 324, 713\r\n Alexander, Major General, 854\r\n Alexander, Mrs. Catherine, 369\r\n Alexander’s Tavern,\r\n Allan, Mrs. Elizabeth R.

Some compound words are found\r\nboth with and without hyphens. Where the hyphen occurs on a line break,\r\nthe hyphen is removed, or not, in accordance with the most common\r\nversion.\r\n\r\nThe entry for Oct. 11, regarding the appointment of Matthew Smith to the\r\nVice Presidency of the Pennsylvania Supreme Executive Council is not\r\nreferred to in the Contents. An entry, enclosed in [ ], is added under\r\nhis name there.\r\n\r\nThe Index entries for ’Nord, Edward’ and ’Nitschmann, Martin’ lacked a\r\npage number. The correct pages (p. 619 and 825, respectively) are added\r\nhere, enclosed in [ ].\r\n\r\nThe Index entry for ’Ringgold, Arthur’ most likely should read ’Ringgold\r\nArtillery’. The founder of the unit was Maj. Sanuel Ringgold. There is\r\nno ’Arthur Ringgold’ mentioned in the text.\r\n\r\nOn p. 518, the antifederalist newspaper founded by Hugh Henry\r\nBrackenridge in 1799 was actually called the “Tree of Liberty”, not the\r\n“Tree of Life” as it appears here and in the Index. There seems to be\r\nsome confusion of “Lawyer Brackenridge” in Pittsburgh, and a later\r\nAmerican painter, Hugh Henry Breckenridge, who worked in Philadelphia\r\nand Massachusetts, and one of whose better known paintings was called\r\n“The Tree of Life”, though the latter is judged to have been created ca.\r\n1929, four years later than the publication date of 1924.\r\n\r\nOn p. 918, there is a passage that opens a quotation, (“it was the\r\nintention...) but has no closure. By context, the quotation would end\r\nwith that sentence (...carried that plan into operation.”) It is\r\npossible that the opening mark is spurious, since there’s no apparent\r\nsource for the passage.\r\n\r\nOn occasion, apparent errors appear in quoted text, in which case they\r\nstand uncorrected but are noted.\r\n\r\nSome items in the Index appear out of alphabetic order. These have been\r\nmarked with a leading ‘*’, but have not been moved.\r\n\r\nThe Index reference to ‘Fontainbleau’ on p. 704 is spelled\r\n‘Fountainbleau', and has been corrected.
