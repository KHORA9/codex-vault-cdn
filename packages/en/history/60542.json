[Illustration]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINTERS' PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBernard's _monograph on Tory was first published in_ 1857, _when M.\r\nBernard was already a recognized authority on the history of typography.\r\nIn_ 1865, _after an interval devoted largely to a search for further\r\ninformation concerning Tory_, _and for probable examples of his work as an\r\nartist_, _a second edition of the book appeared_, _enlarged by more than\r\none-half_, _arranged more systematically_, _and embellished with several\r\nadditional engravings of designs which are_, _in the author's opinion_,\r\n_attributable to Tory. The Iconography, which forms the third part of this\r\nrevised edition, did not appear as such in the first edition, although a\r\nsmall part of the material it contains may be found scattered through that\r\nedition. It now occupies more space than the Biography and Bibliography\r\ncombined. The new arrangement necessitated more or less repetition where,\r\nas in many instances, the same book is referred to by M. Bernard in more\r\nthan one section of his work; and this repetition sometimes reveals\r\ndiscrepancies between the different descriptions. Where such discrepancies\r\nhave been discovered by him the translator has endeavoured to correct\r\nthem, generally, in the absence of an opportunity to inspect the volume in\r\nquestion, assuming that the description in the bibliographical section is\r\nmore likely to be trustworthy; in a number of cases, however, inspection\r\nof title-pages themselves, or of reproductions thereof, has enabled him to\r\ncorrect numerous minor errors in transcription._\r\n\r\n_The kindness of the late Mr. Amor L. Hollingsworth, in lending his fine\r\ncopy of the first edition of 'Champ fleury,' made it possible to collate\r\ntherewith M. Bernard's numerous extracts from that rare and interesting\r\nbook, and to ensure entire accuracy with respect to them._\r\n\r\n_As M. Bernard writes certain printers' names in different ways, the\r\ntranslator has assumed that the names are printed differently in different\r\nbooks, and has not attempted to make them uniform. Such names are Dubois_\r\n(_Du Bois_), _Lecoq_ (_Le Coq_), _Galliot_ (_Galiot_). _The few notes\r\nsupplied by the translator are inserted in square brackets._\r\n\r\n_The translations of Tory's various Latin effusions, including the\r\ncomplete text of the little brochure called forth by the death of his\r\ndaughter Agnes, were made by Mr. J. W. H. Walden of Cambridge. The Latin\r\noriginals will be found at the end of the book, in Appendix X._\r\n\r\n_Since such authorities as M. Bernard and M. Renouvier differ as to the\r\nascription to Tory of many of the designs mentioned in this work, it\r\nseemed the wiser course to choose for illustration only such subjects as\r\nare described by the author, without questioning the soundness of his\r\nreasoning or the infallibility of his deductions. The only exception is\r\nthe beautiful design reproduced on the first page of the Index. This is\r\ntaken from Robert Estienne's folio New Testament_ (_in Greek_) _of_ 1550,\r\n_where_, _with two other similar decorations_, _it occurs in conjunction\r\nwith the friezes and floriated Greek letters reproduced elsewhere in this\r\nvolume_. _They are unsigned, but all are indubitably from the same hand.\r\nAlthough they are not mentioned by M. Bernard, it seems incredible that he\r\nshould never have seen them._\r\n\r\n_The printer of this volume has had more than ordinary good fortune in\r\nliterally stumbling upon most of the designs here reproduced. The pressure\r\nof other work has prohibited systematic research, and the originals of\r\nthese illustrations were nearly all discovered while he was engaged\r\nupon other matters. Many were found in the Harvard Library, some in the\r\nreference library of the Riverside Press, some in auction rooms, and some\r\nin booksellers' catalogues. The only exception is the series of borders\r\nfrom the Hours of_ 1524-25, _which were expressly photographed from the\r\ncopy in the library of the British Museum._\r\n\r\n_That so much has come to hand in so haphazard a way is but an additional\r\nproof of Tory's industry and versatility. There seems to be almost no\r\nlimit to the work which may fairly be credited to him, and M. Bernard\r\nhardly exaggerated when he said that there was scarcely an illustrated\r\nvolume of any importance issued in Paris during the first half of the_\r\nXVI _th century in which the artist of the Lorraine cross did not have\r\na hand. Hours and Classics, Bibles and Testaments, Mathematical and\r\nMedical works--all bear evidence to his prolific pen and graver, and\r\nwere time disregarded, the preparation of this volume might be almost\r\nindefinitely prolonged. Incomplete as it is, however, it is hoped that it\r\nwill measurably fulfill the desire expressed by Mr. A. W. Pollard nearly\r\nfifteen years ago, in the first issue of 'Bibliographica.' Speaking of\r\nBernard's monograph, he said_, _'It would be pleasant if some French\r\npublisher would bring out a new edition worthily illustrated_, _for in_\r\n1865 _the modern processes of reproduction were not yet invented_, _and\r\nthe few and poor woodcuts in M. Bernard's book give no just idea of the\r\nartistic powers of Tory_, _whose illustrated editions are so difficult to\r\nmeet with that M. Bernard's admirable commentary loses half its value for\r\nlack of a proper accompaniment of text.'_\r\n\r\n_A word regarding the method of reproduction of these illustrations may\r\nnot be out of place here. More was aimed at than mere photographic copies,\r\nwhich are in many ways inadequate. It was thought desirable to make the\r\ndecorations an integral part of the typographic treatment of the volume\r\nand to preserve when practicable their original relations to the type. To\r\nattain this end, more perfect printing plates were necessary than could be\r\nobtained directly from the old editions. The designs, therefore, were all\r\nredrawn with the greatest care over photographs of the originals, and from\r\nthese drawings photo-engravings made, which were afterward perfected by\r\nhand when the forms were on the press._\r\n\r\n_Notwithstanding some inevitable slight divergences of line, this\r\nmethod preserves with far greater faithfulness the spirit and effect\r\nof the original prints, and the result is more truly a facsimile than\r\na direct photographic copy would have been. Both drawing and engraving\r\nof Tory's designs were exquisite, and as a rule they were beautifully\r\nprinted, especially by Colines and Robert Estienne. Some of them,\r\nhowever, suffered at the hands of inferior printers. Imperfections and\r\nirregularities due to the carelessness or unskilfullness of the printer\r\nare readily discernible, and in the reproductions in this volume have been\r\neliminated. The preservation, by this treatment, of more of the beauty and\r\ninterest of the originals is sufficient justification for departing to\r\nthis extent from the usual methods of facsimile reproduction._\r\n\r\n_Following the French fashion, the Table of Contents and List of\r\nIllustrations are printed at the end of the volume._\r\n\r\n    G.

Typographical arrangement, appearance of\r\nthe letters and ornaments, everything, even to the cover, was changed\r\nalmost at the same time, or, at all events, within a very few years. At\r\nthat time printing gave over the servile copying of manuscripts, which\r\nhad at first served it as models, and adopted special rules, better\r\nadapted to its method of execution. For instance, it relegated notes to\r\nthe foot of the pages, calling attention to them by marks of reference,\r\ninstead of placing them at the side of the text, as had previously been\r\nthe custom, at the cost of an enormous amount of labour, without benefit\r\nto the reader. It also abandoned the use of red capitals,[1] which, by\r\nincreasing the labour twofold, made books expensive, and replaced them\r\nby floriated letters, which were quite as distinctive, but were set up\r\nand printed with the text. This style of ornament, so favourable to\r\nartistic results, developed rapidly, and soon extended from the letters\r\nto the illustrations, which began to be introduced in books in constantly\r\nincreasing numbers. Under the general impulsion of the Renaissance,\r\nengraving was transformed: instead of the coarse woodcuts, of the\r\nso-called criblé style, in which the background was black sprinkled with\r\nwhite dots,[2] and the design stamped in white, as with a punch, engraving\r\nin relief came into vogue, just as we have it to-day, identical in form,\r\nalthough the processes have been perfected. A similar revolution took\r\nplace in the matter of letters: the gothic or semi-gothic characters,\r\nwhich had hitherto been used, were replaced by roman characters of a novel\r\nshape, borrowed from the monuments of antiquity (then studied with great\r\nardour), which continued in use until the Revolution. Lastly, the covers\r\nof books also underwent a transformation brought about by the force of\r\nevents: the parchment rolls used by the ancients had been succeeded,\r\nduring the Middle Ages, by bound volumes, of a shape more convenient\r\nfor reading; these volumes, of which those who were fortunate enough to\r\nown any never owned more than a very small number, being intended to be\r\narranged on the library shelves in such wise as to present one side to\r\nthe visitor's eye, were adorned with numerous ornaments of various sorts\r\non that side, so that they could easily be distinguished. Later, these\r\nornaments were omitted and the title of the book substituted, in huge\r\nblack or gauffered letters. But the invention of printing soon caused\r\nthat device to be abandoned. As the increasing numbers of books made it\r\nimpossible to give up so much space to them, they were arranged side by\r\nside on the shelves, care being taken to print the title in gold letters\r\n(so that it might be more legible) on the back of the book, which was the\r\nonly part of it in sight. This innovation compelled the doing away with\r\nraised decorations, especially those in precious stones or in metal, which\r\nwould have torn the books that stood next them. Thereafter leather binding\r\ncame into general use; the gauffering on the sides was continued for some\r\ntime; but in the sixteenth century this in turn was replaced by gold\r\ntooling 'à filet,' and the transformation was complete.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe man who contributed most largely to the threefold evolution I have\r\ndescribed was Geofroy Tory, a man who is hardly known to-day,[3] despite\r\nall his talents, although he received in 1530, as reward of his labours,\r\nthe title of king's printer, which François I had never before bestowed\r\nupon any one. I say that Tory is hardly known to-day; in truth, it is,\r\nin his case, equivalent to being unknown, to be known, as he is, only\r\nas a publisher. Some few scholars, to be sure, are aware that he was a\r\nprinter; but the fact is so little known that his biographer has denied\r\nit.[4] As for his noblest title to fame, that of engraver, nobody is aware\r\nof it; and yet we owe to Tory the resuscitation of engraving in France.\r\nAs the historian of typography,[5] I have thought that it was for me to\r\ndescribe with special care one of the fairest jewels in his crown. Such\r\nis the purpose of the work here presented, wherein will also be found, in\r\nconnection with the honour paid to Tory by François I, some information\r\nconcerning the first royal printers, and a list of those officers from the\r\nbeginning down to the extinction of the office in 1830, three centuries,\r\nyear for year, after its creation. François I is, in truth, entitled to\r\nbe considered the creator of the office of king's printer, for prior to\r\nhis reign we find but one typographer who bore that title, while, from\r\nFrançois I down, the series of king's printers was not again interrupted.\r\nThe appointment of Pierre le Rouge, on whom the title was bestowed in\r\n1488,[6] may be creditable to Charles VIII, but it was without result. The\r\nhonour of having made of the eminently literary post of king's printer\r\na permanent office reverts of right and naturally to the prince who has\r\nbeen called the Father of Letters. In truth that prince, as we shall see\r\nhereafter, was not content with a single printer; he had several at once,\r\nwith distinct functions, and appointed successors without loss of time to\r\nsuch as retired or died during his lifetime.\r\n\r\nBut, I repeat, the principal purpose of my work is to make Tory known as\r\none of the most skilful engravers we have ever had. Of course I cannot\r\nforget that he was the learned editor of the 'Cosmographie du Pape Pie\r\nII,' the 'Itinéraire Antonin,' etc.; the publisher, of rare taste, who\r\nput forth the Hours of 1525, 1527, etc.; the accomplished printer of\r\nthe 'Sacre de la Reine Eléonore,' and the distinguished philologist of\r\n'Champ fleury,' to whom, as we shall see, we owe the invention of the\r\northographic forms peculiar to the French language.[7] But what has\r\nespecially attracted me in Tory is his work as an engraver. In that\r\nrôle he was without predecessor or rival, for those persons who may be\r\nrepresented as such may have been his pupils, nothing more. Jean Duvet\r\nalone might quarrel with this limitation; but, although he was Tory's\r\ncontemporary, he was not his teacher; for Tory had gone for his schooling\r\nin the art to the very fountain-head, to Italy, before Duvet produced\r\nanything. As for Jean Cousin, de Laulne, du Cerceau, Léonard Gauthier, and\r\nthe rest, they did not come until after Tory. The honour of revivifying\r\nthe art of engraving in France belongs to Tory alone, bestriding two\r\ncenturies, the fifteenth and sixteenth; indeed, some of his productions\r\nare pure gothic. This I propose to demonstrate in the third part of my\r\nbook, after I have, in the first part, narrated the general facts of\r\nour artist's life, in which we may observe also the development of a\r\nrevolution in the matter of philology; for Tory was a devoted partisan of\r\nthe classic tongues before he became one of the sturdiest champions of the\r\nFrench language.\r\n\r\nIn order to emphasize the importance of the orthographic reform achieved\r\nby Tory, I have usually followed the orthography of the time in my\r\nquotations from ancient works. It is an anachronism, to be sure, but it\r\nis of no consequence when the reader is forewarned. I have also felt at\r\nliberty to correct now and then, without calling attention to them, the\r\ntypographical errors found in the texts quoted.\r\n\r\nI will not conclude without thanking publicly those persons who have\r\nkindly assisted me in my researches concerning Tory. I have had occasion\r\nto mention their names in the course of my work, but that is not enough:\r\nI beg them to accept in this place the assurance of my gratitude. There\r\nare two to whom I am especially grateful, for they have considerably\r\naugmented my store of documents: they are MM. Achille Devéria[8] and\r\nOlivier Barbier, of the Bibliothèque Impériale: it is owing to their kind\r\ncommunications to me that the list of Tory's artistic works will be found\r\nnot far from complete.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This term, which is wrongfully used in printing today\r\nto denote all majuscules, was formerly employed only for the initial\r\nletters of _chapters_. It was in this sense that Schoeffer used it when\r\nhe said, in 1457, that his Psalter was _venustate capitalium distinctus_\r\n[distinguished by the beauty of its capitals]; also Chevillier, when he\r\nwrote in the _Origine de l'Imprimerie de Paris_ (page 32), that the books\r\nof the first printers of Paris had no 'capitals,' the chapter initials\r\nbeing left blank, to be made by the illuminators. M. Crapelet, taking the\r\nword in its present meaning, concluded therefrom that the books of Gering\r\nand his associates were without majuscules; and he thereupon attributes\r\nthe introduction of roman letters in Paris to Josse Bade, in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, but he is altogether wrong.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: [_Criblé_, lit. sifted.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: I retain the phraseology of the first edition of my book,\r\npublished in 1856; but the fact is that, thanks to that publication, Tory\r\nis no longer in the same plight. His books have become formidable rivals\r\nto those of Vostre, Vérard, etc. One of his Books of Hours sold recently\r\nfor more than 3000 francs.

In any case, his assumption of the title does not prove that he\r\nreceived royal letters patent, as all the other printers did, as we shall\r\nsee later.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Tory also essayed a reform in Latin orthography, but it was\r\nless happily conceived, and did not succeed.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Alas! since this preface was first printed, we have had the\r\nmisfortune to lose the eminent artist whom I have named.

BIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLess than twenty years after the introduction of printing at Paris, there\r\nwas born at Bourges a child of the people, destined to impart to French\r\ntypography a vigorous artistic impulsion, or, to speak more accurately, to\r\nwork therein a genuine revolution. Geofroy Tory[9] was born in the capital\r\nof Berry, about 1480, of obscure, middle-class parents, as he himself\r\ntells us.[10] Everything seems to indicate that he first saw the light\r\nof day in the faubourg of Saint-Privé, to this day the abode of humble\r\nvine-dressers. How, in that most lowly condition of life, he succeeded in\r\nacquiring the degree of education which he afterward exhibited, it is hard\r\nto say. However, it is proper to remember that Bourges was at that time a\r\nmetropolitan and university city, where there were several schools, both\r\necclesiastic and lay. We may well believe that, having, at an early age,\r\naroused the interest of some patron by virtue of his fortunate natural\r\nendowments and his intelligence, he was admitted to the schools attached\r\nto the chapter, where he learned the first elements of grammar. We shall\r\nsoon find him dedicating the first fruits of his labours to a canon of the\r\nmetropolitan church of Bourges, who seems to have been, at that time, his\r\nMæcenas.\r\n\r\nOnce master of the first rudiments of grammar, Tory perfected himself\r\nby following the curriculum of the university, where, as we learn from\r\nhimself, he had for his teacher a Fleming named Guillaume de Ricke,\r\notherwise called 'le Riche' in French and 'Dives' in Latin; and for a\r\nfellow disciple under this Ghent-born master, a certain Herverus de\r\nBerna, from Saint-Amand, who afterward wrote a panegyric of the Comtes de\r\nNevers.[11]\r\n\r\nTory then went, to finish his literary education, to Italy, whither he\r\nbetook himself early in the sixteenth century. He sojourned principally\r\nin Rome, where he attended most frequently the famous college called\r\nLa Sapienza,[12] and in Bologna, where he attended the lectures of the\r\ncelebrated Filippo Beroaldo, who died in 1505.[13] Tory returned to France\r\na little before that event, and established his domicile in Paris, which\r\nhe always loved henceforward as one loves one's native city,[14] and where\r\nhe began his literary career.\r\n\r\nThe first work of his of which we have any knowledge is an edition of\r\nPomponius Mela, which he prepared for the bookseller Jean Petit; it was\r\nprinted by Gilles de Gourmont because it required the use of some Greek\r\ntype.[15] This book was dedicated by Tory to his compatriot Philibert\r\nBabou, at that time valet de chambre to the king. The dedicatory epistle\r\nis dated Paris, the VI[16] of the Nones of December, 1507; but the\r\nprinting of the book was not completed until January 10, 1508 (new\r\nstyle).[17] Several articles in this volume, which were written by Tory,\r\nare signed by the word CIVIS, which he had adopted for his\r\ndevice. That patriotic designation was well suited to a descendant of\r\nthose Bituriges who strove vainly at Avaricum[18] to defend the autonomy\r\nof Gaul against Cæsar. In any event it is interesting to find, three\r\nhundred years before Jean-Jacques Rousseau, a man, justly proud of his\r\nlearning, which he owed entirely to himself, clothing himself in that\r\ntitle of citizen, which was formerly held in such honour in the provincial\r\ncities, and especially in Bourges, whose name Tory never fails to append\r\nto his own: 'Geofroy Tory de Bourges.'\r\n\r\nThis erudite production and the patronage of Philibert Babou were perhaps\r\nresponsible for Tory's appointment to the office of regent, otherwise\r\ncalled professor, of the College of Plessis, where we find him installed\r\nin 1509. It was there that he edited for the first Henri Estienne the\r\n'Cosmographie du pape Pie II.'[19]\r\n\r\nThe dedication of this book, addressed by Tory to Germain de Gannay, canon\r\nof the metropolitan church of Bourges, and recently appointed Bishop of\r\nCahors by King Louis XII,[20] was dated at the College of Plessis, on the\r\nVI of the Nones of October,[21] 1509. Tory's edition (the third according\r\nto him) contains forty-one quarto sheets of text, and is accompanied by\r\na map of the old world. The 'avis au lecteur,' also written by Tory, is\r\nsigned, according to his custom, with the word CIVIS. In the\r\nfollowing year, in collaboration with a compatriot and fellow pupil,\r\nHerverus de Berna, Tory published a short Latin poem on the Passion,\r\nwritten by his former teacher, Guillaume de Ricke. In this wise he\r\nacquitted his debt of gratitude.[22] Shortly after, Tory published for the\r\nMarnef brothers an edition of Berosus, who was then much in vogue, thanks\r\nto the fabrications of Annius of Viterbo. This book, the preface of which\r\nis dated May 9, 1510, went to no less than three editions, to say nothing\r\nof those issued by other publishers.[23]\r\n\r\nIn the same year Tory published for the same booksellers a small\r\nvolume of miscellanies, under this title: 'Valerii Probi grammatici de\r\ninterpretandis Romanorum literis opusculum, cum aliis quibusdam scitu\r\ndignissimis.' It was probably printed by Gilles de Gourmont, for we find\r\nin it his unaccented Greek type.[24] This volume, which contains twelve\r\noctavo sheets, has two engravings on wood--the mark of the booksellers on\r\nthe title-page, and a Roman portico a little farther on. There are also a\r\nfew small cuts engraved on metal in one of the articles. The dedicatory\r\nepistle, dated at the College of Plessis the VI of the Ides of May (May\r\n10), 1510, and addressed by Tory to two compatriots, who had probably\r\nbeen his fellow pupils, is signed by his device, the word CIVIS.\r\nThe dedication begins thus: 'Godofredus Torinus Bituricus ornatissimos\r\nPhilibertum Baboum et Ioannem Alemanum Iuniorem, cives Bituricos, pari\r\ninter se amicitia conjunctissimos, salutat.' Babou and Lallemant were at\r\nthis time two important personages in Bourges: the former was secretary\r\nand silversmith to the king, the other, mayor of the city. We see that\r\nTory had acquired valuable connections in his native place, despite his\r\nmodest origin. Among the extracts from ancient authors in this book he\r\ninterspersed several pieces of verse of his own composition.[25]\r\n\r\nFinally, in the same year, Tory issued an edition of Quintilian's\r\n'Institutiones,' carefully collated by him with several manuscripts.\r\nThis work was undertaken at the request of Jean Rousselet, Seigneur de\r\nLa Part-Dieu, near Lyon, and an ancestor of Château-Regnaud, Maréchal de\r\nFrance. This Rousselet, who died in 1520, belonged to one of the wealthy\r\nLombard families which had settled at Lyon long before; they made, as\r\nwe see, a noble use of their wealth. His real name was Ruccelli. He had\r\nmarried a young gentlewoman of Bourges, Jeanne Lallemant, daughter of Jean\r\nLallemant, Seigneur de Marmagne, a school friend of Tory, whom I have\r\nalready had occasion to mention. Doubtless it was this connection which\r\nbrought Tory into relations with Rousselet. The text is preceded by the\r\nfollowing dedicatory letter:\r\n\r\n    _Geofroy Tory of Bourges to Jean Rousselet, devoted lover of\r\n    letters, long life and happiness._\r\n\r\n    Never, I think, most illustrious Jean, will you omit or cease to\r\n    have the aspiration of nobly justifying, both by your character\r\n    and by your good deeds, the great hopes which your relatives and\r\n    your country have of you. That you might benefit the State by\r\n    your counsel also, you made it your interest that I should emend\r\n    Quintilian and have him printed as handsomely as might be. After\r\n    carefully collating a large number of manuscripts, I industriously\r\n    set to work and, by eliminating almost countless errors, I made a\r\n    single manuscript of considerable accuracy. This, in accordance\r\n    with your orders, I sent from Paris to Lyon. I only hope that the\r\n    printers will not introduce other, new, errors. Farewell, and love\r\n    me.\r\n\r\n    Paris, at the College of Plessis, the third of the Calends of\r\n    March.[26]\r\n\r\nThis book, which forms a large octavo volume, unpaged, printed in italic\r\ntype, and in which we find some most attractive Greek type, with accents,\r\nwas finished on the VII of the Calends of July (that is to say, June\r\n25), 1510. The printer's name does not anywhere appear, and the place of\r\nprinting (Lyon) is mentioned only in Tory's letter.[27]\r\n\r\nI know of nothing of Tory's dated in 1511[28]; but that does not prove\r\nthat he produced nothing in that year, for it is certain that about that\r\ntime he published several works which have not come down to us. In fact,\r\nhe tells us in his 'Champ fleury'[29] that he has 'caused to be printed\r\nand put before the eyes of worthy scholars divers little works in Latin,\r\nboth in verse and in prose.' Now we know of nothing of his in verse prior\r\nto 1524, except what we find at the end of the 'Valerius Probus' of 1510,\r\nand of Guillaume de Ricke's 'Passion.' Moreover, the absence of any\r\npublication by Tory in 1511 may be explained by the confusion incident\r\nto his retirement from the College of Plessis and his installation at\r\nthe College Coqueret, which seems to have taken place in that year, but\r\nconcerning which I have no other information than the imprint on two books\r\npublished by him in the following year.\r\n\r\nThe first work edited by Tory in 1512 was an architectural treatise\r\nentitled: 'Leonis Baptistæ Alberti Florentini.--Libri de re ædificatoria\r\ndecem,' etc.; a quarto volume of 14 preliminary leaves and 174 leaves of\r\ntext. This book was printed by Berthold Rembolt (whose mark it bears on\r\nthe first page), at the joint expense of that printer and the bookseller\r\nLouis Hornken, whose mark is at the end of the book. The dedication,\r\nwhich is addressed to Philibert Babou, and dated at the College Coqueret\r\non the XV of the Calends of September (August 18), 1512, informs us that\r\nTory received the manuscript of the book from his friend Robert Dure,[30]\r\nprincipal of the College of Plessis, who gave it to him four years\r\nearlier, when Tory himself was professor at the same college. As always,\r\nthis dedication is signed CIVIS. A note on the last page but one\r\ninforms us that the printing was finished on August 23, 1512.[31]\r\n\r\nThe second work put forth by Tory in 1512 was the 'Itinerarium Antonini.'\r\nIt was the second book that he prepared for Henri Estienne, in whose\r\nestablishment it has been said[32] (erroneously, I think) that he filled\r\nthe post of corrector of the press. However that may be, the dedication,\r\naddressed by Tory to Philibert Babou, is dated at the College Coqueret\r\nthe XIV of the Calends of September (August 19), 1512. Tory says to Babou\r\nthat he had dispatched a copy of the manuscript of this book to him at\r\nTours four years before (that is to say, in 1508), but that the person to\r\nwhom it was entrusted for delivery to him had given it, in his own name,\r\nto somebody else. This time, in order not to be defrauded of the fruits\r\nof his labours, he had caused the work to be printed from his own copy,\r\nhaving carefully collated it with a manuscript lent him by Christophe de\r\nLongueil.[33] The volume is a sexto-decimo, remarkable for the beauty of\r\nits execution. The copy in vellum which I have seen at the Bibliothèque\r\nNationale is still redolent of the fifteenth century. We find in it\r\ncertain verses of the Burgundian Gérard de Vercel in honour of Tory, which\r\nprove that the latter was even then in some repute as a scholar, and as\r\na printer, too; for the author contrasts him with the wretched printers\r\nof the day. The preliminary matter, by Geofroy Tory, is signed by the\r\nword CIVIS, printed in red. At the end of the volume the same\r\nword reappears in a very curious monogram composed of the letters CIVS\r\nso arranged that we can read the word CIVIS in all directions.\r\nTherein we may detect thus early Tory's taste for ciphers and devices, a\r\ntaste to which he afterward gave free rein, in his 'Champ fleury.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAt this epoch occurs a momentous event in Geofroy Tory's life. On August\r\n26, 1512, he became the father of a daughter, who was christened Agnes.\r\nI do not know the date of his marriage, but it was at least as early as\r\n1511. A document of much later date, to which we shall have occasion to\r\nrefer hereafter, informs us that his child's mother was named Perrette\r\nle Hullin. There is reason to believe that she, like her husband, was of\r\nBourges, as the name of Hullin was common there at that time. Soon after\r\nthe birth of Agnes, perhaps just at the opening of the term of 1512, Tory\r\nentered the College of Bourgogne as regent, or professor of philosophy.\r\nHis lectures, which were continued for several years, were attended by a\r\nlarge number of hearers, if we may believe a poetical epitaph composed in\r\nlaudation of him and published by La Caille.[34] Tory himself seems to\r\nrefer to this professorship in his 'Champ fleury,'[35] but I have been\r\nunable to find any record of it, because, presumably, the new direction\r\nin which he was then turning his faculties required a certain time of\r\npreparation.\r\n\r\nThis is what happened: Tory, whose activity was very great, did not\r\nconfine himself to his professorship,[36] but set about learning drawing\r\n(probably under the instruction of Jean Perreal, of whom I shall have\r\noccasion to speak again), and also engraving, for which he had a special\r\nbent. This apprenticeship, with the duties of his professor's chair,--for\r\nTory drove art and philosophy side by side, as the epitaph just quoted has\r\nit ('philosophiam simulque artem exercuit typographicam'),[37]--engrossed\r\nhim completely for three or four years; but at the end of that time,\r\nbeing far from content with his attempts at printing and engraving, or\r\ntoo enthusiastic to be satisfied with a partial result, he determined to\r\nstudy classic forms and outlines in Italy itself, of which country he\r\nhad retained such agreeable memories that he speaks of it constantly.\r\nConsequently he abandoned his professorship and started south again. It\r\nwas on this journey that he visited the Coliseum 'more than a thousand\r\ntimes,'[38] that he saw the theatre of Orange,[39] and the ancient\r\nmonuments of Languedoc[40] and of other places in France and Italy,[41]\r\nwhich he cites as his authorities on every page of his 'Champ fleury.'\r\n\r\nTory does not give the precise date of this artistic journey; but it is\r\nestablished by a passage in his book, where he informs us that he saw the\r\n'Epitaphs of Ancient Rome' printed in that city.[42] Now this book of\r\nEpitaphs can be no other than the collection published by the celebrated\r\nprinter Mazochi, under the title: 'Epigrammata sive inscriptiones antiquæ\r\nurbis,' folio, dated 1516, but preceded by a license from the Pope, of\r\n1517.[43] This hint of Tory's is doubly valuable to us, for it not only\r\ntells us the date of our artist's second journey to Italy, but reveals\r\nhis predilection for typography. As we see, he was already studying the\r\nprinting art with interest.\r\n\r\nOn his return to Paris, about 1518, Tory, who was not a wealthy man, was\r\nobliged to think about turning his talents to account, in order to earn\r\nhis living. His principal resource seems to have been the painting of\r\nmanuscripts, otherwise called miniature; but, whether because he did not\r\nfind sufficient work of that sort, or because he considered another branch\r\nof art more useful, he soon gave his entire attention to engraving on\r\nwood, in which he speedily acquired considerable celebrity. About the same\r\ntime, Tory also joined the fraternity of booksellers, following a custom\r\nthen quite general among engravers,--a custom which their predecessors,\r\nthe miniaturists, had handed down to them, and which was continued down to\r\nthe eighteenth century.[44] In truth, it was not unnatural that those who\r\ndecorated books should sell them, or, if you prefer, that those who sold\r\nthem should decorate them. It was one way of earning more money. Desiring\r\nto signalize his début in the career of a bibliopole in a noteworthy way,\r\nTory undertook to engrave for himself a series of borders 'à l'antique,'\r\nwhich he intended for a book of Hours,--a sort of book that was very\r\nprofitable at that time, because of the great amount of work which it\r\nrequired; but the task was a long one, and he was obliged to work for\r\ndifferent printers in the mean time. One of the first who employed him was\r\nSimon de Colines. Colines, who became a printer in 1520, as a result of\r\nhis marriage to Henri Estienne's widow, commissioned Tory to design marks,\r\nfloriated letters, and borders for the books that he published in his own\r\nname; he also entrusted him, I think, with the engraving of his italic\r\ntype, which he soon began to use in conjunction with the roman type that\r\nhe had from his predecessor.\r\n\r\nBut Tory's active mind could not be content with a single occupation.\r\nHe was a patriot first of all, as his device proves. And so, far from\r\nallowing himself to be engrossed by his memories of the literary and\r\nartistic treasures of Italy, he began to study with ardour the monuments\r\nof his mother tongue, not only in those books printed in French--very few\r\nas yet--which he had at hand in his shop, but also, and especially, in\r\ndivers fine manuscripts on parchment confided to him by 'his good friend\r\nand brother, René Massé, of Vendôme, chronicler to the king,' whose\r\nmerits, entirely forgotten in our day,[45] he warmly extols.[46]\r\n\r\nNow, while studying that same French tongue, so decried by the scholars\r\nof his time, Tory discovered therein beauties which required only a\r\nlittle cultivation to make of it the finest language in the world. From\r\nthat moment our Berrichon, hitherto a partisan of the classics, shook off\r\nentirely the yoke of Greek and Latin, and thought only of the means of\r\nmaking French take precedence everywhere.\r\n\r\n'I see,' he says, 'some who choose to write in Greek and in Latin, and\r\nyet cannot speak French well.... To me it seems, with submission, that\r\nit would better beseem a Frenchman to write in French than in another\r\ntongue, as well for the profit of his said French tongue, as to adorn his\r\nnation and enrich his native language, which is as fair and fine [belle\r\net bonne] as another when it is well set down in writing.... When I see\r\na Frenchman write in Greek or in Latin, I seem to see a mason clad in\r\nphilosopher's or king's garb, who would fain recite a mask on the stage of\r\nLa Baroche[47] or in the confraternity of La Trinité, and cannot pronounce\r\nwell enough, as having too thick a tongue; cannot bear himself well, nor\r\nwalk fittingly, insomuch as his legs and feet are unwonted to the gait of\r\nphilosopher or king. Who should see a Frenchman clad in the native dress\r\nof a Lombard, which is most often long and scant, of blue linen or of\r\nbuckram, methinks that Frenchman would scarce jest at his ease without\r\nsoon slashing it and taking from it its true form as a Lombard dress,\r\nwhich is but very rarely slashed, for Lombards do not often work havoc\r\nwith their belongings. However, I leave all this to the wise guidance\r\nof learned men, and will not burden myself with Greek or Latin save to\r\ncite them in due time and place, or to talk with such as cannot speak\r\nFrench.'[48]\r\n\r\nTory had found his vocation at last. He resolved to establish the\r\nsuperiority of his mother tongue in a special book, illustrated by\r\nengravings by his own hand, and intended particularly for printers and\r\nbooksellers, who were in a position to distribute it so rapidly with the\r\naid of their connections.\r\n\r\nBut while he was engaged in his studies, a terrible catastrophe fell upon\r\nhim without warning, and caused him to forget his new projects for some\r\ntime. His daughter Agnes, of whom he had conceived the most brilliant\r\nhopes, was taken from him on August 25, 1522, at the age of nine years\r\neleven months and thirty days, that is to say, ten years less one day.\r\nEntirely absorbed by his grief, Tory wrote a short Latin poem upon the sad\r\nevent. This poem, dedicated, like most of his other books, to Philibert\r\nBabou, was not published until February 15, 1523 (1524, new style). In\r\nthis little work, consisting of two quarto sheets, are contained some most\r\ninteresting details of Tory's life. We learn here, for example, that he\r\nhad grounded his daughter Agnes, young as she was, in Latin and the fine\r\narts.\r\n\r\n'Desiring to instruct me in the Ausonian tongue, and also to render me\r\naccomplished in the polite arts, he, like a most affectionate father,\r\nteaching me night and day, himself laid the foundations, sweet and ample,\r\nfor my life.'[49]\r\n\r\nFarther on, he makes his daughter speak thus, from the depths of the urn\r\nin which she is supposed to repose:--\r\n\r\n    MONITOR\r\n\r\n    Who made for you this urn set with brilliant gems?\r\n\r\n    AGNES\r\n\r\n    Who? My father, famed in this art.\r\n\r\n    MONITOR\r\n\r\n    Your father is certainly an excellent potter.\r\n\r\n    AGNES\r\n\r\n    He practises industriously every day the liberal arts.\r\n\r\n    MONITOR\r\n\r\n    Does he also write melodies and poems?\r\n\r\n    AGNES\r\n\r\n    He does. He also blesses with sweet words this lot of mine.\r\n\r\n    MONITOR\r\n\r\n    Yes, the skill of the man is wonderful.\r\n\r\n    AGNES\r\n\r\n    Hardly has any land produced so famous a man.[50]\r\n\r\nWe learn from this that Tory was not only a scholar, which we already\r\nknew, but an artist of great merit. Who knows? it may be that we had in\r\nhim the making of a Benvenuto Cellini. What more was necessary that he\r\nshould reveal himself as such? Very little--perhaps the falling in with a\r\nwealthy Mæcenas. In fact, we find these lines in another piece of verse in\r\nthe same collection:--\r\n\r\n    WAYFARER\r\n\r\n    He is certainly well deserving of some Mæcenas.\r\n\r\n    GENIUS\r\n\r\n    Few are the Mæcenases who live in the French world. No one\r\n    to-day either encourages the liberal arts by appropriate gifts\r\n    or undertakes to encourage them in any way. Uprightness and fair\r\n    virtue are in no esteem. So powerful is the sway of unhappy Avarice.\r\n    Treachery, deceit, and vice are in the ascendant. Virtues are put in\r\n    the background, and every form of wretched evil creeps abroad.\r\n\r\n    WAYFARER\r\n\r\n    What, therefore, does he who is trained by the charming Muses?\r\n\r\n    GENIUS\r\n\r\n    He takes pleasure in being able to live in his own house.\r\n\r\n    WAYFARER\r\n\r\n    He ought to go with hurried step to the courts of kings.\r\n\r\n    GENIUS\r\n\r\n    He does not care to, because he has a free heart. Your potentates\r\n    sometimes take pleasure in looking at songs, but what then? They\r\n    requite them with nods. Golden songs, drawn from the high heavens,\r\n    they should reward with jewels and with pure gold. But, frivolous as\r\n    they are, they instead foolishly give their grand gifts to fools,\r\n    spendthrifts, and rogues.[51]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlas! this depiction of the vices of society is not peculiar to the\r\nsixteenth century. The world is very old, and it changes little. If Tory\r\nwere living in our day, it may be that he would use even darker colours;\r\nfor, after all, he was appreciated in his own time, and perhaps he would\r\ndie of hunger to-day. As we see, he was not fond of cooling his heels in\r\nthe antechambers of the great, and lived peacefully in his own house; but\r\nhonour came there to seek him. Unluckily it was a little late, as will\r\nappear hereafter.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the poem is the design reproduced on the next page, wherein\r\nwe see for the first time the famous 'Pot Cassé' [broken jar] which Tory\r\nadopted thenceforth as the mark of his bookshop; together with the device\r\n'non plus,' which he used thereafter instead of the word 'civis.'\r\n\r\nTory subsequently offered, in his 'Champ fleury,' a very confused\r\nexplanation of his Pot Cassé, doing his utmost to connect it with the\r\nordinary events of life; but everything tends to prove that it owes its\r\norigin to the death of Agnes. This shattered antique vessel represents\r\nTory's daughter, whose career was shattered by destiny at the age of\r\nten. The book secured by padlocks suggests Agnes's literary studies; the\r\nlittle winged figure among the clouds is her soul flying up to heaven. The\r\ndevice 'non plus' suggests the desperate grief of Tory, who seems to say:\r\n'I no longer [non plus] care for anything'; or, more laconically: 'There\r\nis nothing more for me'; after the example of Valentine of Milan when he\r\nfound himself in a similar situation.[52]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLuckily, time, which deadens all sorrows, even those which seem likely\r\nto endure for ever, assuaged Tory's grief. Before his funeral poem saw\r\nthe light, he had returned to his beloved studies, and they had restored\r\ntranquillity to his mind. This is proved by the following passage from his\r\n'Champ fleury,' in which he tells us how, on January 6, 1523 (or 1524,\r\naccording to our method of computing time), that is to say, eighteen\r\nmonths after he lost his daughter, the idea of that curious book came\r\nto his mind. We are glad to recognize once more therein the patriotic\r\nBerrichon who had taken for his device the word 'civis.'\r\n\r\n'In the morning of the day of the feast of Kings,'[53] he says, '... which\r\nwas reckoned M. D. XXIII, the fancy came to me to muse in my bed,\r\nand to move the wheel of my memory, thinking on a thousand petty conceits,\r\nboth serious and merry, whereamong I bethought me of a letter of ancient\r\nform, which I not long since made for the house of my lord the treasurer\r\nof the wars, Maistre Jehan Groslier, counsellor and secretary to the king\r\nour sire, lover of goodly letters and of all learned persons, of whom also\r\nhe is greatly beloved and esteemed, as well on this side as the other of\r\nthe mountains. And while thinking of that said antique letter there came\r\nof a sudden to my memory a pithy sentence of the first book and eighth\r\nchapter of Cicero's \"Offices,\" where it is written: \"Non nobis solum nati\r\nsumus, ortusque nostri partem patria vendicat, partem amici.\"[54] Which is\r\nto say, in substance, that we are not born into this world for ourselves\r\nalone, but to do service and pleasure to our friends and our country.'[55]\r\n\r\nSuch was the origin of 'Champ fleury.' Here follows the composition of\r\nthat work, as the author himself gives it to us, in the form of a table of\r\ncontents, at the beginning:[56]--\r\n\r\n'This whole work is divided into three books.\r\n\r\n'In the first book is contained the exhortation to establish and ordain\r\nthe French language by fixed rule, and to speak elegantly, in good and\r\nsoundest French.\r\n\r\n'In the second is treated the invention of antique letters, and the\r\nproportionate coincidence thereof with the natural body and face of the\r\nperfect man. With several happy inventions and reflections upon the said\r\nantique letters.\r\n\r\n'In the third and last book all the said antique letters, in their\r\nalphabetical order, are drawn and proportioned in height and width\r\naccording to their proper formation and required articulation, both Latin\r\nand French, as well in the ancient as in the modern fashion.\r\n\r\n'In two sheets at the end are added thirteen different sorts of letters,\r\nto-wit: Hebrew, Greek, Latin, French,--and these latter in four sorts,\r\nwhich are: \"cadeaulx,\" \"forme,\" \"bastarde,\" and \"torneure.\" Then follow\r\nthe Persian, Arabic, African, Turkish, and Tartar letters, which have, all\r\nfive, one and the same type of alphabet. After these are the Chaldaic,\r\nthe \"goffes,\" which are otherwise called \"impériales et bullatiques,\"\r\nthe \"phantastiques\" letters, the utopian letters, which one may call\r\n\"voluntaires,\" and, lastly, the floriated letters.[57] With instructions\r\nfor making ciphers of letters for golden rings, for tapestries,\r\nstained-glass windows, paintings, and other things, as may seem best.'\r\n\r\nI will say nothing here of the first book, the excellence of which has\r\nrecently been pointed out by M. Génin,[58] who is much better versed in\r\nthe subject than I, and who has at the same stroke exculpated the French\r\nfrom the charge that has been brought against them of having allowed\r\nthemselves to be anticipated by foreigners in the careful study of their\r\nlanguage. I will simply call attention to the fact that Tory wrote shortly\r\nbefore Rabelais, who did not hesitate to borrow from him his criticism of\r\nthe 'skimmers of Latin,'[59] who were then changing the French language\r\non the pretext of perfecting it. The harangue of the Limousin orator,\r\nwhich is found in the sixth chapter of the second book of 'Pantagruel,' is\r\ncopied verbatim from Tory's epistle to the reader.[60] Rabelais has simply\r\nadded to it some obscene reflections which did not enter our author's\r\nmind. Tory ends with a pathetic appeal to those who are interested in\r\nthe mother tongue, whose excellence he is never tired of extolling. 'O\r\nye devoted lovers of goodly letters!' he cries, 'God grant that some\r\nnoble heart may give itself to the task of establishing and ordering our\r\nFrench tongue according to rule! By that means would many thousands of\r\nmen set themselves to using often goodly words. If it is not established\r\nand ordered, we shall find that the French tongue will be in great part\r\nchanged and ruined every fifty years.'[61] This patriotic prayer was soon\r\ngranted. As we know, the sixteenth century did not lack great geniuses,\r\nwho set the French language in order and brought it to a great degree of\r\nperfection. Indeed, some most expressive words, the disuse of which Tory\r\ndeplored,[63] reappeared. For instance, 'affaissé' and 'tourbillonner,'\r\nwhich in his time had been replaced by periphrases, returned into use;\r\nmany others deserve the same honour and perhaps will receive it some day.\r\n\r\nThe second book of 'Champ fleury' is, I apprehend, only a paradox; but\r\nthat paradox is maintained by arguments so ingenious, that one lacks\r\ncourage to condemn it. Tory holds that the shapes of all the roman capital\r\nletters are derived from the different parts of the human body, which he\r\nlooks upon as the type of the beautiful; and he makes a most admirable use\r\nof wood engraving to explain his idea. Moreover, if Tory was mistaken,\r\nwe must acknowledge that he did not fall into the error inconsiderately.\r\nIndeed, I believe that he had for confederate his friend Perreal, to whom\r\nwe may attribute the greater number of the designs on wood in the second\r\nbook, judging from those in the third, which are directly attributed to\r\nhim by Tory, as we shall see hereafter. However that may be, Tory seems to\r\nhave studied his subject for a long time, not only on ancient monuments,\r\nbut on modern ones as well, and in the works of contemporary authors who\r\nhad turned their attention to the shapes of letters. His judgement of\r\nthese latter is as follows:--\r\n\r\n'Frère Lucas Paciol, of Bourg Saint Sepulchre, of the order of Frères\r\nMineurs, and a theologian, who has written in popular Italian a book\r\ncalled \"Divina proportione,\"[64] and who has essayed to represent the said\r\nantique letters, does not give a true account of them nor explain them;\r\nand I am not surprised thereat, for I have heard from certain Italians\r\nthat he stole his said letters and took them from the late Messere Leonard\r\nVince [Leonardo da Vinci], who has of late died at Amboise, and was a\r\nmost excellent philosopher and admirable painter, and as it were another\r\nArchimedes. This said Frère Lucas has caused his antique letters to be\r\nprinted as his own. In sooth they may well be his, for he has not drawn\r\nthem in their due proportions, as I shall show when I speak of said\r\nletters. Nor does Sigismunde Fante, a noble of Ferrara, who teaches how\r\nto write many kinds of letters, speak truly thereof.[65] Nor does Messere\r\nLudovico Vincentino.[66] I know not whether Albert Dürer writes justly\r\nthereof,[67] but none the less he goes astray in the due proportion of\r\nthe figures of many letters, in his book on \"Perspective.\"[68]... I see\r\nno man who makes them or understands them better than Maistre Simon\r\nHayeneufve, otherwise called Maistre Simon du Mans. He makes them so well\r\nand in proper proportions, that he satisfies the eye as well and better\r\nthan any Italian master on this side or the other of the mountains. He\r\nis most excellent in the restoration of ancient architecture, as one may\r\nsee in a thousand excellent designs and portraits that he has made in the\r\nnoble city of Mans and in many a foreign city. He is worthy to be held in\r\nhonoured memory, as well for his upright life as for his noble learning.\r\nAnd to this end, let us not fail to consecrate and dedicate his name to\r\nimmortality, naming him a second Vitruvius, a holy man and good Christian.\r\nI write this with good will because of the virtues and great praise \"which\r\nI have heard said of him\" by many great and humble good men and true\r\nlovers of all goodly and honest things.'[69]\r\n\r\nThe eulogistic tone in which Tory speaks here and elsewhere[70] of Simon\r\nHaieneuve leads M. Renouvier to think[71] that our artist may have learned\r\nthe art of drawing letters from the Mans architect; but it is a mistaken\r\nsupposition; the phrase in quotation marks proves that they had never\r\nmet. Moreover Tory, a little further on, claims most reasonably the\r\nhonour of having been his own master in this matter: 'I know no Greek,\r\nLatin nor French author who gives the explanation of such letters as I\r\nhave described, wherefore I may hold it for my own, saying that I have\r\nexcogitated and found it rather by divine inspiration than by anything\r\nwritten or heard. If there be any one who has seen it written, let him say\r\nso, and he will give me pleasure.'[72]\r\n\r\nWe see that Tory does not beat about the bush concerning his theory,\r\nwhich, although it was different from those of his predecessors, was\r\nnot on that account better than theirs.[73] However, let his opinion\r\nconcerning the original design of the roman letters be what it may, it is,\r\nin my judgement, simply a sort of preface which we may pass over without\r\ninconvenience. The real substance of his work is in the third book. But\r\nhe does not leave the second without returning once more to the charge in\r\nfavour of his mother tongue.\r\n\r\n'I know,' he says, 'that there are many goodly minds who would willingly\r\nwrite many excellent things if they thought they could write them well\r\nin Greek or Latin; and yet they abstain for fear of making solecisms or\r\nsome other fault that they dread; or they choose not to write in French,\r\nthinking the French tongue not good nor elegant enough. With all respect\r\nto them, it is one of the most beauteous and graceful of all human\r\ntongues, as I have shown in the first book by the authority of noble and\r\nancient authors, poets and orators, as well Latin as Greek.'[74]\r\n\r\nTo be accurate, I will say that this idea of the 'preëxcellence of the\r\nFrench tongue,' which, a little later, was the subject of another special\r\nwork on the part of another famous printer, the second Henri Estienne,\r\nwas neither new nor original with Tory. No less than three hundred years\r\nbefore, it had been set forth in honest French by an author who cannot\r\nbe taxed with patriotic illusions, for he was an Italian. This is what\r\nBrunetto Latini wrote at the beginning of a sort of encyclopædia which he\r\nprepared in the thirteenth century, under the name of 'Trésor':--\r\n\r\n'Et se aucuns demandoit por quoi cist livres est escriz en romans selonc\r\nle langage des François, puisque nos somes Ytaliens, je diroie que ce est\r\npor deux raisons: lune, car nos somes en France, et lautre, porce que la\r\nparleure est plus delitable et plus commune a toutes gens.'[75]\r\n\r\nAs I have said, the third book is the important part of Tory's work.\r\nLaying theory aside, he there gives us the exact design of the letters\r\nof the alphabet and the method of executing them. He does not overlook,\r\nmoreover, this essential fact--that the designer of letters and the\r\nprinter ought before all else to be grammarians in the ancient meaning\r\nof the word[76]; and at the same time that he gives us the shape of\r\na letter, he instructs us as to its value and pronunciation. It is\r\nat this point that Tory's book becomes especially interesting to us:\r\nhe passes in review the pronunciation in vogue in each of the French\r\nprovinces, or nations, as they were called then. One after another they\r\nappear before us, with their special idioms, which have become mere\r\nmyths to-day,--Flemings, Burgundians, Lyonnaises, Forésiens, Manseaux,\r\nBerrichons, Normans, Bretons, Lorrainers, Gascons, Picards, and even\r\nItalians, Germans, English, Scotch, etc. His observations do not stop\r\nat the somewhat mixed idioms of the men,[77] but extend to the more\r\nindividual language of the women. For instance, he informs us that\r\n'the ladies of Lyon often gracefully pronounce A for E, as when they\r\nsay, \"Choma vous choma chat effeta,\"[78] and a thousand other like\r\nexpressions'; whereas, on the contrary, 'the ladies of Paris very often\r\npronounce E instead of A, as when they say: \"Mon mery est a la porte de\r\nPeris, ou il se faict peier\"; instead of saying, \"Mon mary est a la porte\r\nde Paris, ou il se faict paier.\"'[79]\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that in this particular the 'ladies of Paris' succeeded\r\nin perpetuating their pronunciation in part, for we do not now say\r\n'paier.' They had equal success in many other cases. For example, it\r\nseems to be due to them that the final S of the plural is not pronounced\r\nexcept under exceptional circumstances[80]: as, for instance, when it is\r\nfollowed by a word beginning with a vowel; for, speaking of the cases in\r\nwhich that letter is elided in Latin, Tory expresses himself thus: 'The\r\nladies of Paris for the most part observe this poetic figure of speech,\r\ndropping the final S in many words, as when, instead of saying: \"Nous\r\navons disne en ung iardin, & y avons menge des prunes blanches et noires,\r\ndes amendes doulces & ameres, des figues molles, des pomes, des poires &\r\ndes gruselles,\" they say and pronounce: \"Nous avon disne en ung iardin,\r\n& y avon menge des prune blanche & noire, des amende doulce & amere, des\r\nfigue molle, des pome, des poyre & des gruselle.\"' The thing that seems\r\nespecially offensive to Tory is that they make the men join them in this\r\nfaulty pronunciation. 'This fault,' he says, 'would be pardonable in them,\r\nwere it not that it passes from woman to man, and that there is entire\r\nabsence of perfect pronunciation in speaking.'[81]\r\n\r\nMoreover, if we are to credit Tory, the provincials have also, in certain\r\ncases, succeeded in establishing their pronunciation, as we may conclude\r\nfrom the following passage, relative to the letter T: 'The Italians\r\npronounce it so full and resonant that it seems that they add an E\r\nthereto, as when, for and instead of saying: \"Caput vertigine laborat,\"\r\nthey pronounce: \"Capute vertigine laborate.\" I have seen and heard it\r\npronounced so in Rome at the schools called La Sapienza, and in many\r\nanother noble place in Italy. Which pronunciation is no wise held or used\r\nby the Lionnois, who drop the said T, and do not pronounce it any wise\r\nat the end of the third person plural of verbs active and neuter, saying\r\n\"Amaverun\" and \"Araverun,\" for \"Amaverunt\" and \"Araverunt.\" In like manner\r\nsome Picards drop this T at the end of some words in French, as when\r\nthey would say: \"Comant cela, comant? monsieur, c'est une jument,\" they\r\npronounce: \"Coman chela, coman? monsieur, chest une jumen.\"'[82] We see\r\nthat the Picard pronunciation has prevailed in this instance, for we no\r\nlonger pronounce the final T at the end of the words 'comment,' 'jument,'\r\nand the like.\r\n\r\nTory did not content himself with setting forth the state of things\r\nexistent in his day: he suggested improvements, almost all of which have\r\nbeen sanctioned by usage. For instance, at the beginning of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, the pronunciation was very difficult to grasp for lack of\r\naccents; he proposed to supply them. 'In our French language,' he says,\r\n'we have no symbol of accent in writing, and it is on account of this lack\r\nthat our language is not yet established nor submitted to fixed rules,\r\nlike the Hebrew, Greek and Latin. I would like that it should be, as might\r\nwell be done.... In French,' he says farther on, 'as I have said, we do\r\nnot write the accent over O vocative, but pronounce it full, as when we\r\nsay:\r\n\r\n    'O pain du ciel angelique,\r\n    Tu es nostre salut antique.\r\n\r\n'In this lack of accent we have an imperfection, which we ought to remedy\r\nby purifying and subjecting to fixed rule and art our language, which is\r\nthe most graceful language known.'[83] Elsewhere he suggests replacing\r\nelided letters by an apostrophe, which had not then been done in French.\r\n'I say and allege these things in this place to the end that if it should\r\nhappen that one had to write in antique letters verses where the S must\r\ndisappear, one may write them honestly and purposely without using the\r\nsaid letter, ... and place a hooked point over the place where it should\r\nbe.'[84] In another place he emphasizes the necessity of the cedilla,\r\nwhich we find in French manuscripts from the thirteenth century, but which\r\ntypography had not as yet adopted. 'C before O,' he says, 'in French\r\npronunciation and language, is sometimes hard, as in saying \"coquin,\"\r\n\"coq,\" \"coquillard\"; sometimes it is soft, as in saying \"garcon,\" \"macon,\"\r\n\"françois,\" and other like words.'[85]\r\n\r\nTory could hardly overlook the matter of punctuation, that most essential,\r\nand even in our day so sadly neglected, branch of orthography; but as he\r\nhad only 'antique' letters to deal with, he presented only three sorts of\r\npunctuation marks, without going into details as to their use, which, in\r\ntruth, if we may judge by his own book, was not as yet fully settled. The\r\ncomma, for instance, which has so much to do with the clearness of the\r\nsentence, is frequently there inserted in a far from rational way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI have said above that Tory had adopted about 1523, for the mark of his\r\nbookshop, the Pot Cassé represented in the engraving placed at the end of\r\nhis poem on his daughter's death. To make it more appropriate for that\r\npurpose, he subjected it to various modifications. At first we find it\r\nalone, as in the accompanying cut, on the cover,[86] or on the back,[87]\r\nof a number of octavo books bound at his establishment. Other bindings, in\r\nquarto, exhibit the broken jar with the drill (_toret_).[88]\r\n\r\nAfterward, Tory placed the jar on a closed book, and still later he\r\nmodified the design by the introduction of other additions.[89]\r\n\r\nFinally, we have Geofroy Tory's device, or mark, definitively constituted\r\nin his 'Champ fleury,' thus:[90]--\r\n\r\n'Behold,' he says, 'my declared device and mark, drawn as I have cogitated\r\nand conceived it, imparting moral meaning thereto, to give friendly\r\nadmonition to the printers and booksellers beyond the mountains[91]\r\nto practise and employ themselves in goodly inventions and delectable\r\nexecution, to show that their wits have not been always useless, but eager\r\nto serve the public weal by labouring to that end and living uprightly.'\r\n\r\nThen follows his explanation of this mark,[92]--an explanation which does\r\nnot invalidate that suggested above.[93] In truth, all that Tory says here\r\nin general terms may be applied to his daughter Agnes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MENTI BONAE DEVS OCCVRRIT.\r\n\r\nSIC, VT. VEL, VT. NON PLVS.]\r\n\r\n'In the first place, there is herein an ancient jar, which is broken,\r\nthrough which is passed a toret. This said broken jar signifies our body,\r\nwhich is an earthen jar. The toret signifies Fate, which pierces and\r\npasses through weak and strong. Beneath this broken jar there is a book\r\nsecured by three chains and padlocks, which signifies that after our body\r\nis broken by death, its life is closed by the three fatal goddesses.[94]\r\nThis book is so firmly closed that there is no man who may come to see\r\nanything therein, except he know the secret of the padlocks, and above\r\nall of the round padlock, which is locked and signed by letters. Even so,\r\nafter the book of our life is closed, there is no man who may in any wise\r\nopen it, except it be he who knows the secrets, and he is God, who alone\r\nknows, before and after our death, what has been, what is, and what will\r\nbe our fate. The foliage and flowers in the said jar signify the virtues\r\nwhich our body may have in itself during its life. The sun-rays which are\r\nabove and beside the toret and the jar signify the inspiration that God\r\ngives us by impelling us to virtue and worthy acts. Near the said broken\r\njar it is written: \"Non plvs,\" which are two monosyllabic words, as well\r\nin French as in Latin, signifying that which Pittacus said long since in\r\nGreek: ΜΗΔΕΝΑΓΑΝ,[95] \"nihil nimis.\" Let us not say, let us\r\nnot do aught beyond measure or beyond reason, except it be in the last\r\nnecessity: \"aduersus quā nec Dij quidē pugnant.\"[96] But let us say and\r\nlet us do \"Sic. vt. vel. vt.\" That is to say, as we ought, or as little\r\nwrongly as we may. If we seek to do well, God will aid us, and therefore\r\nhave I written above: \"Menti bonæ Deus occurrit,\" that is to say, God goes\r\nout to meet the desire to do good, and gives it aid.'\r\n\r\nI believe that we should see in the toret an 'enseigne parlante,'\r\nalluding at once to Tory's name and to his various professions. The way\r\nin which the name of the instrument was pronounced, its shape, resembling\r\nthat of a T, and, lastly, its use by the engravers, were doubtless the\r\nconsiderations that led Tory to adopt it. But let us not subtilize too far.\r\n\r\nTory was not content with giving us his symbol in 'Champ fleury': he\r\nengraved on the first page of that book, that is to say, in the place\r\nof honour, what would be called to-day the blazonry of his artistic\r\nacquirements,--in other words, a collection of all the tools that he used.\r\nUnfortunately, he did not feel called upon, as in the case of his mark,\r\nto supply an explanation, deeming the matter clear enough; whereas, in\r\nour day it has become rather difficult, because of the changes that have\r\ntaken place in the customs of artists, to state the exact use of some of\r\nthe tools. The order in which they are arranged, however, may assist us,\r\nto a certain extent, in identifying them. An exact reproduction of this\r\nengraving, the initial letter of the first page of the text of 'Champ\r\nfleury,' is given at the beginning of this section.[97]\r\n\r\nThe first series of tools, suspended in the first arabesque, embraces\r\na pair of compasses, a rule, and a square: these are the fundamental\r\ninstruments of art and of geometry. In the second arabesque, if I am\r\nnot mistaken, we find an 'échoppe' and a burin, engravers' tools; in\r\nthe third, a writing-case (or 'galimart'), a pencil, and a knife, above\r\na book; these are the tools of the writer and the draughtsman. In the\r\nfourth, we find an object which I take to be a small box of colours,\r\nhanging from a case of brushes; these appertain to the painter. Tory was,\r\nin fact, draughtsman, painter and engraver.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI have already said that Tory was probably instructed in the art of\r\ndrawing by the famous Jean Perreal. He was on terms of the closest\r\nfriendship with that artist, who drew several of the vignettes in 'Champ\r\nfleury,' if we may judge by the one positively attributed to him, which\r\nis printed on the verso of folio 46. Geofroy informs us that this plate,\r\ninsignificant in itself (it represents two circles in which are the\r\nletters I and K, modelled on the human body), was engraved from the design\r\nof a friend of his, 'from that which a noble lord and good friend of mine,\r\nJehan Perreal, who is otherwise called Jehan de Paris, valet de chambre\r\nand excellent painter to King Charles VIII, Louis XII, and François, first\r\nof the name, made known and gave to me, most excellently drawn by his\r\nhand.' Now this engraving is in all respects similar to those to be found\r\nin the second book of 'Champ fleury.' Both in form and subject, it is\r\naltogether different from those in the third book, in which Tory printed\r\nit. Probably Perreal died while the work was on the press, and Tory, who\r\nhad not thought of naming him while he was alive, in connection with his\r\nfirst drawings, did so after his death, by publishing the last souvenir of\r\nthis sort which he possessed from the hand of his friend, although it did\r\nnot fit perfectly with the subject; he laid, as it were, a flower on the\r\ndead man's grave.[98]\r\n\r\nWe give this drawing also, as the only work which can be with certainty\r\nattributed to Jean Perreal, and as a specimen of the engravings which\r\nserve as a foundation for the reformation of the roman letters proposed by\r\nTory in the second book of his 'Champ fleury.'\r\n\r\nFrom what I have said it will be seen that Tory's book required several\r\nyears of labour. Nor is one surprised thereat when one considers the great\r\nnumber of engravings which it contains. But even without the engravings,\r\nit will readily be understood that a work which necessitated so much\r\nobservation required a vast expenditure of time. Begun, as we have seen,\r\nin 1523 (1524, new style), it was not finally completed until 1529, that\r\nis to say, after six years of toil. However, Tory did not propose that\r\nthose years should be lost for art. Desirous to preach by example rather\r\nthan by precept, he determined to publish, in the interim, other books\r\nwherein he might give utterance to his artistic taste. And he did in fact\r\nprint books of Hours, admirably executed, which, although in different\r\nform, may fitly be compared to the Hours of Simon Vostre, who had acquired\r\nso great a reputation in that typographical specialty. Tory received from\r\nFrançois I a 'privilége' (license) for this work, to run six years, dated\r\nat Avignon, September 23, 1524.[99] This license to print[100] informs\r\nus that Tory had 'made and caused to be made[101] certain illustrations\r\n[_histoires_] and vignettes \"a lantique\" and likewise some \"a la moderne,\"\r\nin order to have the same printed, and to serve _a plusieurs usages\r\ndheures_,' and that to that end he had 'expended an exceeding long time\r\nand incurred divers great expenses and outlays.'\r\n\r\nThe first book of this sort which he published, so far as I have learned,\r\nis an edition in quarto of the Hours of the Virgin, according to the Roman\r\nuse, in Latin. It is a superb volume, printed by Simon de Colines, with\r\nborders and illustrations 'à l'antique,' perfect in taste and execution.\r\n\r\nThe book was undoubtedly printed by Colines as a joint venture with Tory,\r\nfor there are copies in existence in the name of each. Those in the name\r\nof Colines bear on the title-page the date 1524, and, at the end, that of\r\nthe 17th of the Calends of February (January 16), 1525; those in the name\r\nof Tory (there are two varieties of these) bear but one date, 1525, and\r\nthat at the end. I shall speak of this book later, in detail.[102]\r\n\r\nTwo years later Tory published a new edition of the same Hours, in a small\r\noctavo volume, also printed by Simon de Colines, in roman type, with\r\nborders and illustrations of the same kind but much smaller.[103] The\r\nprinting was finished October 21, 1527. It is preceded by a new license\r\nfrom François I, extending Tory's rights for ten years, not for this book\r\nalone, but for the earlier one as well, 'for certain illustrations and\r\nvignettes \"a lantique\" by him heretofore printed,' and in consideration of\r\nthe great outlay which his engravings had caused him to make. This license\r\nis dated at Chenonceaux, September 5, 1526, and includes 'Champ fleury,'\r\nthe printing of which had begun, but which had not yet received its poetic\r\ntitle, for it was still referred to as 'Lart et science de la deue et\r\nvraye proportion des lettres.' In the same year Tory published an edition\r\nin quarto of these same Hours, according to the use of Paris, printed by\r\nSimon Dubois (Silvius). This book, in which we find again the license\r\nof 1526, is printed in gothic type, with borders and illustrations of a\r\nspecial style, called 'à la moderne.' The borders are arabesques formed of\r\nplants, insects, birds, animals, etc. At the foot we see the F, crowned,\r\nof François I, and the salamander; the L, crowned, of Louise of Savoy, the\r\nking's mother; and the impaled shield of France and Savoy, etc. Of this\r\nbook also I shall speak in detail hereafter.[104] Finally, a little later,\r\nat a time which I am unable to fix precisely, but prior to 1531, Tory\r\ncaused to be printed another book of Hours of the same description, that\r\nis to say, with borders of plants, insects, birds, etc., but in a smaller\r\nformat--small octavo. I shall describe it in its place.[105]\r\n\r\nThese publications did not prevent our artist from giving his attention\r\nto literature. While he was overlooking the impression of his Hours and\r\nhis 'Champ fleury,' he was preparing various works to which we shall have\r\noccasion to refer hereafter. Generally speaking, they are translations\r\nintended to enrich the French tongue; for Tory did not lose sight of his\r\npatriotic purpose. All of these works were printed subsequently, save one,\r\nperhaps--a translation of the hieroglyphs of Orus Apollo, which he gave\r\nto a 'noble lord and good friend of his.'[106] It is not known whether\r\nthis translation was ever printed. There are many editions of Orus in\r\nexistence, but no one of them bears the name of Tory.\r\n\r\n'Champ fleury' appeared at last in 1529. We have seen that this book was\r\nconceived on 'the day of the feast of Kings, which was reckoned M.\r\nD. XXIII,' that is to say, January 6, 1524, new style. The printing\r\nwas not completed until 'the XXVIII day of the month of April\r\none thousand five hundred XXIX,'[107] as we learn from the\r\nsubscription at the end; that is to say, it cost nearly six years of toil.\r\nThe following is an exact copy of the title-page as it appears in the\r\nfirst edition:--\r\n\r\n    CHAMP FLEVRY. Au quel est contenu Lart & Science de la deue & vraye\r\n    Proportiõ des Lettres Attiques, quõ dit autremēt Lettres Antiques,\r\n    & vulgairement Lettres Romaines, proportionnees selon le Corps &\r\n    Visage humain.--Ce Liure est Priuilegie pour Dix Ans Par Le Roy\r\n    nostre Sire, & est a vendre a Paris sus Petit Pont a Lenseigne du\r\n    Pot Casse par Maistre Geofroy Tory de Bourges/Libraire, & Autheur du\r\n    dict Liure. Et par Giles Gourmont aussi Libraire demourant en la Rue\r\n    sainct Iaques a Lenseigne des Trois Coronnes.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to see here the name of the first printer in Greek\r\ntype in Paris. It was Gourmont himself who printed this learned book,\r\nwherein we find some very interesting details concerning the Hebrew,\r\nGreek and Latin letters, of which he exhibits models which have not\r\nchanged since that time.[108] The workshop of Gilles de Gourmont was\r\non rue Saint-Jean-de-Latran; but we see that in 1529 he had a bookshop\r\non rue Saint-Jacques, at the sign of the Trois Couronnes,--an allusion\r\ndoubtless to the three roses which adorned the chief, or top, of his\r\nshield. This shop adjoined the church of Saint-Benoît on the north.[109]\r\nAs for Tory, he seems to have lived at this time on the Petit-Pont, 'next\r\nto Hostel-Dieu.' It was there that he wrote his book, for he dates his\r\nepistle to the reader thus: 'En Paris ce. XXVIII. Jour Dapvril\r\nsus Petit Pont, a Lenseigne du Pot Casse.' He had, however, another abode\r\non rue Saint-Jacques, opposite the 'Écu de Bâle,' the sign of Chrétien\r\nWechel.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 'Champ fleury' is printed the license of September 5,\r\n1526, already published in the two editions of the Hours of 1527, which\r\ngranted to Tory a ten years' right, not only for the Hours, but also for\r\n'Champ fleury,' which was then being printed, but, as I have already said,\r\nhad not then received that graceful title. This license makes it clear\r\nthat as early as 1526 Tory was thinking of joining the brotherhood of\r\nprinters. He became a printer in fact soon after the publication of his\r\nbook, and proceeded to print several works of his own composition. I give\r\nhere a list of these various publications, in the order of their dates.\r\n\r\n    I. La Table de lancien philosophe Cebes ... Avec trente Dialogues\r\n    moraulx de Lucian ... translate de latin en vulgaire françois par\r\n    maistre Geofroy Tory de Bourges...[110]\r\n\r\nThe license is of September 18, 1529, for ten years. The printing was\r\nfinished October 5, 1529. It is a small octavo volume, in two parts,\r\nwith roughly executed borders on each page. There are twelve preliminary\r\nleaves, containing a long list of errata, and two series of signatures,\r\nthe first running from A to T, the second from _a_ to _v_. The book was\r\nfor sale at the translator's shop, 'rue Sainct Iaques, devant lescu de\r\nBasle,[111] a lenseigne du Pot Casse,' and at Jean Petit's on 'rue Sainct\r\nIaques, a lenseigne de la Fleur de lys.' There is nothing to indicate\r\nwhere the book was printed; but as it is set in the type used for the\r\n'Epitaphs' of Louise of Savoy, I am inclined to think that it came from\r\nTory's workshop. In that case it was the first book that he printed.[112]\r\nThe long list of errata would seem, in truth, to suggest a novice, and\r\nwould explain why no printer's name is given.\r\n\r\nIn the letter 'to the readers' at the beginning of this book, Tory returns\r\nto the charge against the villains [_rufients_] who were changing the\r\nFrench language on the pretext of perfecting it. There are some tirades\r\nquite worthy of a place in 'Champ fleury.' He ends his preamble with a\r\ncurious passage which gives us an idea of his tastes. 'I believe that if\r\nthe ancient and noble painter Zeuxis of Heraclea, if Raphael of Urbino,\r\nMichel Angelo, Leonardo da Vinci or Albrecht Dürer[113] should try to\r\npaint philosophers and their various aspects, they could not paint them\r\nso well nor so to the life as our Lucian paints them herein.' Lastly, he\r\ninforms the reader that he will soon make him 'another new gift';[114] and\r\nhe kept his promise by publishing the following work.\r\n\r\n    II. Summaire de chroniques contenans les vies, gestes et cas\r\n    fortuitz de tous les empereurs Deurope, depuis Iules Cesar iusques\r\n    a Maximilien dernier decede ... par ... Iehan Baptiste Egnace,\r\n    Venicien. Et translate de ladicte langue latine en langaige francoys\r\n    par maistre Geofroy Tory de Bourges.\r\n\r\nAn octavo volume, containing 16 leaves of preface, 99 of text, and an\r\nindex containing 13 leaves--128 in all. At the end, we read: 'The printing\r\nof this book was finished at Paris the XIII day of April, M. D.\r\nXXIX, for maistre Geofroy Tory de Bourges, who sells it at said\r\nParis, at the sign of the Pot Casse.' In Tory's preface, addressed 'to all\r\nstudious and true lovers of honest letters,' he says: 'I promised you of\r\nlate in the preface to the \"Table of Cebes\" that in a short space I would\r\nmake for you another new book.' It was in fulfilment of that promise that\r\nhe published the 'Summaire de Chroniques' of Egnasio.\r\n\r\nThe date of printing given above corresponds to April 13, 1530, new style;\r\nfor Easter fell in that year on April 15. Some bibliographers mention an\r\nedition of this book of 1520; but it is an error, for the license is dated\r\n1529. La Caille[115] says that the edition of 1529 was printed by Tory;\r\nthis is possible, but not certain. It may even be that it was printed by\r\nGourmont, for it is set in the same type used in 'Champ fleury.'[116]\r\nThere are three later editions of this book, printed by Charles l'Angelier\r\nin 1541, 1543, 1544 (octavo); we shall speak of them hereafter. As for\r\nthe edition of 1529, I found it only in the library of M. Ambroise Firmin\r\nDidot, who kindly allowed me to describe it. This copy is still in the\r\noriginal binding, with the Pot Cassé.\r\n\r\nBut all these works did not cause Tory to lose sight of his great\r\npatriotic idea. He did not confine himself to simple wishes for the\r\nwelfare of the French language. In default of the other 'noble hearts'\r\nwhom he invited 'to establish and order our language by rule,'[117] he\r\nhimself undertook that work. Rich in materials as he was, and with the\r\nardor with which he entered into everything, he soon completed his task.\r\nThe license to print the 'Summaire de Chroniques' includes a book by Tory\r\nentitled: 'Les Reigles generales de lorthographe du langaige françois,'\r\nwhich he proposed soon to put on the press. Was this book ever printed?\r\nwas it ever finished? These are questions which I am unable to answer,\r\nfor I have discovered no trace of it elsewhere; but so many other books\r\nhave disappeared that I should not be surprised to learn that this one had\r\nundergone the same fate.\r\n\r\n    III. Hours (in Latin) according to the Roman use; sixteenmo, with\r\n    illustrations and borders; printed in roman type; finished February\r\n    8, 1529, which date corresponds to February 8, 1530, new style, and\r\n    proves that Tory had become a printer in 1529. Here is the exact\r\n    title of this book, which I shall describe in detail later:[118]\r\n    'Horæ in laudem beatissimæ Virginis Mariæ secundum usum romanum.' On\r\n    the last leaf are these words: 'Parrhisiis, apud Gotofredum Torinum\r\n    Biturigum. VIII. die febr. anno sal. M. D. XXIX.\r\n    Ad insigne Vasis effracti.'\r\n\r\n    IV. Ædiloquium ceu (_sic_) disticha partibus ædium urbanarum et\r\n    rusticarum suis quæque locis adscribenda. Item, epitaphia septem de\r\n    amorum aliquot passionibus, etc. Authore Gotofredo Torino Biturigico.\r\n\r\nParis, Simon de Colines, 1530;[119] italic type; 3 octavo sheets, with\r\nlicense for two years. This book has, in the second part, seven charming\r\nengravings on wood. I cannot understand why Tory did not print it, as he\r\nwas then a printer. May it have been because it was customary at that time\r\nto print poetical works in italic type, and he had none in his printing\r\noffice? Copies of the book are preserved in the Bibliothèque Nationale, at\r\nthe Arsenal [two] and at Sainte-Geneviève. The copy in the Bibliothèque\r\nNationale is still in the original binding, with the Pot Cassé.[120]\r\n\r\nAlluding to the first part of his book, Tory expresses himself thus in his\r\n'avis au lecteur': 'There are certain eminent painters in this prolific\r\nage, most gentle reader, who, by their drawings, paintings, and varied\r\ncolouring, depict the tribal gods and human beings, as also other things\r\nof different sorts, with such exactness that a voice and a soul seem\r\nthe only things wanting to them; but here, most gentle reader, I offer\r\nyou, nearly in the manner of these painters, a house, which not only is\r\nelegant and finished in its outlines and parts, but even speaks prettily\r\nand describes itself part by part in a eulogy.'[121] It will be seen that\r\nTory's thoughts were still engrossed by art.\r\n\r\n    V. Science pour senrichir honnestement et facilement, intitulée\r\n    Leconomic Xenophon, nagueres translatee de grec et latin en langaige\r\n    francoys, par maistre Geofroy Tory de Bourges.--On les vend a Paris,\r\n    en la rue Sainct Iaques, devant lescu de Basle, et devant lesglise\r\n    de la Magdalaine, a lenseigne du Pot Casse.\r\n\r\nOctavo, of 9 sheets; printing finished July 5, 1531.[122] On the back of\r\nthe title-page are these words: 'At the said sign of the Pot Casse are\r\nalso for sale Thucydides and Diodorus, with some other excellent books\r\ntranslated from Greek and Latin into French. Likewise there are fine Hours\r\nand Offices of Our Lady, large, medium and small, with illustrations and\r\nvignettes \"a l'antique.\"'\r\n\r\nWere the Thucydides and Diodorus printed by Tory, as well as the large,\r\nmedium and small Hours? Possibly, but I have found no indication of it.\r\nAs for attributing the translations to him, that is out of the question,\r\nfor he says nothing of it in the dedication, addressed to Antoine du Prat,\r\nCardinal de Sens, etc., wherein he mentions the preceding works of the\r\nsame sort:--\r\n\r\n'After the book of the Explanation of the antique letters, called\r\n\"Champ Fleury,\" which I put together in the French language, and the\r\n\"Table de Cebes,\" with thirty moral dialogues; likewise the \"Summaire\r\nde Chroniques,\" which I translated into our said language, to confer a\r\nbenefit on the studious, ... it seemed to me to be a worthy way of passing\r\nmy time to employ myself in translating the \"Economic Xenophon\" also.'\r\n\r\nTory does not mention here the 'Ædiloquium,' probably because that book\r\nwas in Latin, or, rather, because it was not printed at the time of the\r\ncomposition of this dedication, which was in all probability written in\r\nthe first three months of 1531, then reckoned in the year 1530,[123] a\r\ncircumstance which, in my opinion, explains the date of the 'Ædiloquium.'\r\nIn fact, that book cannot have been printed before 1531, for the license\r\nof the 'Economic Xenophon,' which includes the 'Ædiloquium' (to which,\r\nby the way, it gives a sub-title, 'et Erotica,' which was rejected when\r\nit was printed, as likely to give a false idea of the book), is dated\r\nJune 18, 1531, and extends Tory's rights to four years instead of the\r\ntwo mentioned on the title-page of the 'Ædiloquium.' From all of which\r\nI conclude that the last-named book was printed before the license was\r\nobtained, but only a short time before, and while the application was\r\npending.\r\n\r\nThe license first mentioned[124] also concedes to Tory an extension of\r\nfour years 'for certain other books, illustrations and vignettes, to cause\r\nto be printed the Hours and Offices of Our Lady, mentioned in two licenses\r\nheretofore granted to him,' dated September 23, 1524, and September 5,\r\n1526. Tory requested this extension of time because he was preparing to\r\nreprint the Hours, as we see by the date of the following book.\r\n\r\n    VI. Hours according to the Roman use, quarto; published October\r\n    20, 1531, in Latin. This was a new edition of the Hours printed\r\n    in 1524-1525 by Simon de Colines. We find the same borders and\r\n    illustrations as before; but several engravings which had already\r\n    appeared in some of the earlier books just described are added. I\r\n    shall describe this book later. It seems to be printed from the\r\n    'Champ fleury' type, and bears the following title: Horæ in laudem\r\n    beatiss. Virginis Mariæ. Ad usum romanum. Parrhisiis apud Gotofredum\r\n    Torinum Biturigicum, regium impressorem.[125]\r\n\r\n    VII. Politiques de Plutarque, cest a dire: Civiles Institutions et\r\n    enseignemens pour bien regir la chose pu[blique] ... translatees ...\r\n    par maistre Geofroy Tory de Bourges. Dediees ... a tresilustre ...\r\n    François de Vallois, Daulphin de France.\r\n\r\nOctavo, with 8 preliminary leaves, and 67 numbered leaves of text.\r\n\r\nOn the verso of leaf 67 we read: 'The printing of this book was finished\r\nSaturday the XV. day of June, M. D. XXXII. by maistre Geofroy Tory de\r\nBourges, bookseller and king's printer, dwelling in Paris, opposite the\r\nchurch of La Magdaleine, at the sign of the Pot Casse.'\r\n\r\nAnother edition was published at Lyon in 1534. We shall refer to it, as\r\nwell as to the earlier edition, hereafter.[126]\r\n\r\n    VIII. La Mouche de Lucian et la Maniere de parler et se taire [de\r\n    Volaterran].--Le tout [translaté] par maistre Geofroy Tory de\r\n    Bourges, imprimeur du Roy et libraire juré en luniversité de Paris.\r\n    On les vend a Paris, devant leglise de la Magdaleine, a lenseigne du\r\n    Pot Casse.\r\n\r\nOctavo, 8 leaves; without date of printing or license, but printed by\r\nGeofroy Tory himself, after February 22, 1533; for he assumes the title\r\nof 'libraire juré'[127] of the University, which did not belong to him\r\nuntil that day. Moreover he makes use in this book of the acute accent,\r\nthe apostrophe and the cedilla, which he never used, as we shall soon\r\nsee, until after the edition of Clement Marot, dated June 7, 1533. It was\r\ntherefore subsequent to that date, but prior to October of the same year,\r\nthat 'La Mouche' was published.[128]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn several of the works we have described, Tory assumes the title of\r\nprinter; in the last three he describes himself as king's printer,\r\nand in one of them as a 'libraire juré' of the University. These last\r\ntwo dignities he owed to the initiative of François I. That king, who\r\nhad never before conferred that honour upon any one, deemed it his\r\nduty to make the author of 'Champ fleury' king's printer. In truth it\r\nwas natural enough to confer that title upon him who had displayed\r\nso perfect an understanding of the art of typography, combined with\r\nsuch a store of literary knowledge, and whose book caused a veritable\r\nrevolution in printing, no less from the technical and practical than\r\nfrom the grammatical and philological standpoint; for there is one\r\nfact which I have not as yet mentioned and which I am glad to set\r\ndown here: immediately after the publication of 'Champ fleury' French\r\ntypography began to include in its fonts of type accents, apostrophes and\r\ncedillas,[129] the absence of which Tory deplored, and which he himself\r\nused soon after, and before any other printer, as we shall see.\r\n\r\nBut the most noteworthy result produced by the publication of 'Champ\r\nfleury' was the reformation of the old types. That book not only\r\ncontributed to the abandonment of gothic letters, but brought about the\r\nremodelling of the old roman letters. Robert Estienne, among others,\r\nre-cast at this time all those that had come down to him from his father,\r\nthe first Henri (or, to speak more accurately, from his father-in-law\r\nSimon de Colines), and replaced them by types of a new shape, which\r\nwere cut, I think, by Tory (for his pupil, Garamond, seems not to have\r\nbeen capable of doing it at this time), and which continued to be used,\r\nalmost without change, down to the time of the Revolution. It is in\r\nthis sense only that it can properly be said that Tory perfected the\r\ntypes of Josse Bade; for I think that he did not cut any type for that\r\ncelebrated printer, who was established in Paris long before Tory turned\r\nhis attention to engraving, and who died in 1535, a few years after the\r\npublication of 'Champ fleury,' without changing in any way his method of\r\nprinting. It was Tory too, doubtless, who cut Robert Estienne's italic\r\ntype; for it bears a strong resemblance to Simon de Colines's, which I\r\nhave already attributed to him.[130]\r\n\r\nThe sensation caused by Tory's book, in foreign countries as well as in\r\nFrance, is evidenced also by the writings of his contemporaries. In Paris,\r\nAntoine du Saix, author of the 'Esperon de discipline,' expresses himself\r\nthus in an epistle in verse dedicated to his friends,[131] among whom\r\nwe find mentioned René Massé, also a friend of Tory, and several other\r\nlittérateurs of the time:--\r\n\r\n    Geoffroy Thory, qui divine as heu main\r\n    Pour figurer dessus le corps humain\r\n    La lettre anticque, ouyant que plume ay prise\r\n    Pour te imiter, ce bourgeon ne meprise,\r\n    Raisin sera, sil a temps de meurer [mûrir].\r\n\r\nIn London, Leonard Coxe, alluding to the grammar published shortly\r\nafter by his compatriot Palsgrave, exclaims: 'Learned Geofroy, he has\r\nfulfilled the wish so often expressed in thy \"Champ fleury,\" for here\r\nwe have the French language taught thoroughly, by virtue of rules duly\r\nauthorized.'[132]\r\n\r\nTory probably received the title of king's printer in 1530, but I do\r\nnot find that he assumed it earlier than 1531, and, failing documentary\r\nevidence, I cannot accredit him with it at an earlier date. It was, I\r\nfancy, his appointment which led the authors of the 'Art de vérifier les\r\ndates' to say that 'François I established the Imprimerie Royale in Paris'\r\non his return from the Abbaye de Veyen, where he had espoused, on July 4,\r\n1530, Eleonora, sister of the Emperor Charles V.[133] It is the fact that\r\nat that time Tory was entrusted with several 'royal printings' concerning\r\nthis marriage of the king. Thus he published, March 16, 1530 (1531, new\r\nstyle), a little work of Guillaume Bochetel, entitled: 'Le Sacre et\r\ncoronnement de la Royne, imprimé par le commandement du Roy nostre sire.'\r\nIt is a thin quarto of 12 leaves, printed with a certain sumptuousness,\r\nand the license, signed 'de la Barre,'[134] is thus conceived:--\r\n\r\n'We have granted to maistre Geofroy Tory, \"marchant libraire, imprimeur,\"\r\nlicense to print the \"Coronnement de la Royne,\" and all other printers are\r\nforbidden to print it for one year,[135] upon pain of a discretionary fine\r\nand of the confiscation of said book, etc. Done at Paris the tenth day of\r\nMarch.' The consecration of the queen had taken place at Saint-Denis five\r\ndays earlier, March 5, 1530 (1531, new style).\r\n\r\nA few days later Tory published another little book by the same author:\r\n'Lentree de la Royne en sa ville et cite de Paris, imprimee par\r\ncommandement du Roy nostre sire.' Quarto, 24 leaves; same arrangement\r\nas in 'le Sacre,' etc.[136] The license, dated at Anet, April 26, 1531\r\n(Easter fell that year on April 9), gives Tory no other title than\r\n'libraire,' but the omission is evidently accidental.[137] The volume\r\ncontains three pieces in Latin verse by Geofroy Tory, two addressed to\r\nthe queen ('ad reginam Leonorem'), the other to the French people ('ad\r\ngentem gallicam'). On the verso of the last leaf are these words: 'The\r\nprinting of this book was finished Tuesday the ninth day of May M.\r\nD. XXXI.' This book exhibits specimens of three different types\r\nused by Geofroy Tory: a 'saint-augustin,' in which the text is printed,\r\na 'philosophie,'[138] and a brevier. In all these publications we find\r\nTory's borders and his broken jar, and these words at the foot of the\r\ntitle: On les vend a Paris, en la rue Sainct Jacques, devant lescu de\r\nBasle, et devant lesglise de la Magdaleine, a lenseigne du Pot Casse.'\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that Tory had left his second domicile, on\r\nthe Petit-Pont, which was too small, doubtless, for his printing\r\nestablishment, and had settled in the heart of the Cité, almost opposite\r\nthe church of La Madeleine, which then stood very near the corner of\r\nrue de la Juiverie and rue de Marmouzets. His new abode was on the site\r\nof the old and famous Halle aux Blés de Beauce, in a house to which he\r\ntransported his sign of the Pot Cassé (which it retained for several\r\nyears), and which corresponds to the present number 16 rue de la Cité,\r\naccording to the evidence courteously furnished me by M. Adolphe Berty,\r\nwhose knowledge of old Paris is so thorough.[139] However that may be,\r\nthe first work in which to my knowledge Geofroy Tory assumes the title\r\nof king's printer is a thin volume of two and a half quarto sheets, of\r\nthe same typographical arrangement as those last described, but printed\r\nin different type, which seems to me to have been cut by Tory. It was\r\npublished on the occasion of the death of Louise of Savoy, mother of\r\nFrançois I, which occurred September 22, 1531. The contents consist of\r\nLatin and French epitaphs composed in honour of the deceased, and it bears\r\non its first page the following title, bisected:--\r\n\r\n'In Lodoicæ regis matris mortem epitaphia latina et gallica.--Epitaphes\r\na la louenge de ma dame mere du Roy faictz par plusieurs recommendables\r\nautheurs.' Below this are these words: 'On les vend a Paris, devant\r\nLeglise de la Magdaleine, a Lenseigne du Pot Casse.'\r\n\r\nThe license, dated at Paris, October 15, 1531, and signed de la Barre,\r\naccords unequivocally to Tory the title of king's printer: 'We have\r\ngranted to maistre Geofroy Tory, merchant, bookseller and _imprimeur du\r\nroy_, leave,' etc. On the last page, which, like the first, is enclosed in\r\na border, are the words: 'Printed at Paris at the sign of the Pot Cassé,\r\nby maistre Geofroy Tory de Bourges, Marchant, Libraire et Imprimeur du\r\nRoy. The XVII day of October M. D. XXXI.'[140]\r\n\r\nWhat salary did Tory receive as king's printer? It is impossible for me\r\nto say positively; however, if we may judge from what happened in 1538,\r\nin the case of Conrad Néobar,[141] he probably received 100 'écus au\r\nsoleil'[142] per year, which, at the current valuation of 45 sous each,\r\nwould make 225 'livres tournois.' Indeed, that sum was paid in 1671, more\r\nthan a century later, to Pierre Le Petit, king's printer.[143]\r\n\r\nIf François I manifested his good will to Geofroy Tory in appointing him\r\nking's printer, he manifested it even more signally by causing him to\r\nbe admitted to the brotherhood of 'libraires jurés' of the University,\r\nwith all the privileges appurtenant to that office.[144] For, in the\r\nfirst instance, he simply made use of his prerogative; in the second he\r\nimposed his will on the University: the number of 'libraires jurés,' which\r\nwas fixed at twenty-four, being full, François I created a twenty-fifth\r\nmembership in Tory's favour, and the University ratified that creation at\r\nits sitting of February 22, 1532 (1533, new style), minuting, however,\r\nthat it was a gift of the King,[145] as if to imply that it was not to be\r\ntaken as a precedent. In fact, they returned to the number twenty-four on\r\nthe death of Tory, which unfortunately was not long delayed.\r\n\r\nFarther on will be found a list of the works published by Tory as king's\r\nprinter, both for the king and for private individuals.[146] I will\r\nmention here a single one, which is of some interest in connection with\r\nthe biography of our artist: the 'Adolescence Clementine' (of Clement\r\nMarot), fourth edition, published by Tory June 7, 1533. On the title-page\r\nis a note in these words: 'With certain accents noted, namely, on É\r\nmasculine different from the feminine, between words joined by synalephe,\r\nand under Ç when it is pronounced like S, the which heretofore, for lack\r\nof suggestion, has not been done in the French language, although it was\r\nand is most essential.' This was the first work in which Tory applied the\r\northographic system he had suggested in 'Champ fleury.'[147] The fact\r\nis evident from the inexperience of the compositors, who made several\r\nblunders in this very note.\r\n\r\nThis book, one of the rare copies of which is in the Bibliothèque\r\nNationale, presents still another interesting peculiarity. The\r\ntitle-page is arranged in a different way from that in vogue at the\r\ntime. In the first three editions the first two words form four lines\r\nof capitals of the same size and length, by virtue of the spacing:\r\nLADOLE--SCENCE--CLEMEN--TINE. In the fourth edition they fill two lines\r\nonly (LADOLESCENCE--CLEMENTINE), but still in type of the same size,\r\ncontrary to the practice of other printers, who would have diminished by\r\nat least one degree the size and length of the lines, without regard to\r\nlogic. They would probably have printed the title thus:\r\n\r\n    L A D O L E S\r\n    CENCE CLEMEN\r\n    tine\r\n\r\nTory's method of execution, which he borrowed from the arrangement of\r\nancient inscriptions, was less agreeable to the eye perhaps, but it was\r\nmore logical. It was a step toward the practice of the present day, in\r\nwhich the size of the letters on a title-page is varied, but is made\r\nconsistent with the importance of the respective words. As will be seen,\r\nTory was, in everything, an initiator.\r\n\r\nThis book was the last one printed by Tory, to my knowledge. He probably\r\ndied shortly after, for we find that his wife was a widow on October 14\r\n[1533], when she executed a lease for nine years of that part of the\r\nHalle de Beauce occupied by her husband's establishment. This lease,\r\ncovering the whole house, was made in consideration of 122 livres 10 sous\r\ntournois. The lessors were agents of the Chapitre Notre-Dame, and the\r\nlessees, 'Martin Féret, baker, and Perrette Le Hullin, widow of Geofroy\r\nTory, in his lifetime bookseller and king's printer, living on rue de la\r\nJuifverie in one of the wings [corps d'hostel] of the building hereinafter\r\nmentioned' (the Halle de Beauce).[148]\r\n\r\nPerrette Le Hullin continued for some time to carry on her husband's\r\nvarious enterprises. Thus, she published in 1535 a remarkable work,\r\ndoubtless begun by him, by command of François I, to whom it is dedicated.\r\nIt certainly should be placed to the credit of Tory, although it does not\r\nbear his name, but simply a mention of his sign: 'Au Pot Casse.' It is a\r\ntranslation of Diodorus Siculus, of which I shall speak later.[149]\r\n\r\nBut the burden of so considerable an undertaking--printing-office,\r\nbookshop, bindery,[150] engraving, etc.--soon compelled Perrette Le Hullin\r\nto abandon a part of it. At the end of the year 1535 she transferred the\r\nprinting-office, the bookshop, and the bindery to Olivier Mallard, who\r\nestablished himself on the same premises occupied by Tory, and under\r\nthe same sign of the Pot Cassé, as we see by a thin volume published\r\nby him on January 19, 1535 (1536, new style), entitled: 'Copie d'une\r\nlettre de Constantinople, de la victoire du grand Sophy contre le grand\r\nTurc.--Paris, Olivier Mallard, à l'enseigne du Pot Cassé, rue de la\r\nJuifverie.' Quarto, of 4 leaves; gothic type.[151]\r\n\r\nTowards the end of 1536, Mallard published the 'Copie de l'arrest du grand\r\nconseil donné à l'encontre du miserable empoisonneur de monseigneur le\r\ndauphin,' etc. An octavo sheet printed in two signatures. On the verso of\r\nthe title begins the text of the decree, promulgated at Lyon Saturday,\r\nOctober 7, 1536; then come several pieces by Jean Henon and 'a \"dizain\" by\r\nthe printer hereof in sorrow for the death of the Dauphin': ten wretched\r\nlines, ending, by way of signature, with the words 'tout par moien,' of\r\nwhich I have been unable to discover the anagrammatic significance. On the\r\nverso of the last leaf we read: 'All booksellers and printers in the city\r\nand provostry of Paris are forbidden to print or put on sale this present\r\n\"copie\" within three months, on pain of confiscation thereof, and of a\r\nfine, save only M. O. Mallard. Given at Paris this XVIII October,\r\n1536.--I. MORIN.'\r\n\r\nThus we see that, even if Mallard was not as yet king's printer, he\r\nwas at least the official printer. I cannot give the exact date of his\r\nappointment as king's printer; but he certainly held that office in 1537,\r\nsince in that year he published a little octavo volume in which he assumed\r\nthe title.[152] The book is entitled: 'De judiciis urinarum tractatus\r\nexprobatis collectus authoribus, etc.--Excudebat O. Mallardus, bibliopola\r\nac impressor regius.--Anno Domini 1537, 8 id. Martii' (March 8).[153]\r\nHe also published in that year, in the same capacity, two works of Jean\r\nGillot:[154] 'De juridictione et imperio libri duo,' and 'Isagoge in juris\r\ncivilis sanctionem' (quarto), on the title-page of which, below the Pot\r\nCassé, are the words: 'Vænit O. Mallardo, regio typographo ac librario,\r\nsub signo Vasis fracti.'[155]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that François I made no difficulty about accepting Tory's\r\nsuccessor as his printer; but he availed himself of Tory's death to\r\nremodel the institution of king's printers. He restricted Mallard's\r\nfunctions to the printing of French, and in the year 1538 appointed two\r\nother king's printers, one, Conrad Néobar, for Greek, the other, Robert\r\nEstienne, for Latin and Hebrew, as an essential complement to the 'Collége\r\ndes trois langues,' now the Collége de France, which he had recently\r\nfounded. We have not the document which conferred upon Robert Estienne\r\nthe title of king's printer; but we have proof that he held that title\r\nin 1539. Maittaire declares, upon what evidence I know not, that Robert\r\nwas appointed on June 24 of that year. I am of the opinion that his\r\nappointment was of earlier date, that is to say, that it goes back, like\r\nNéobar's, to 1538, or, to speak more accurately, to the beginning of 1539.\r\nIn fact, we find him assuming the title of king's printer ('typographus\r\nregius') in several works printed by him during that year. Furthermore,\r\nI may mention the fact that, in a most interesting edict concerning the\r\nprinters of France, dated August 31, 1539, the king already refers to the\r\nfact that he has 'of late created and ordained--in order to have a copious\r\nsupply of useful and essential books--royal printers in the Latin, Greek,\r\nand Hebrew tongues.'[156]\r\n\r\nWe have not the letters patent of Robert Estienne, but we are more\r\nfortunate in respect to Néobar, for we have the document by which he\r\nwas created king's printer for Greek.[157] This curious document, which\r\ndoes so much honour to François I, well deserves to win oblivion for his\r\nunlucky edict of proscription against printing, rendered January 13, 1535\r\n(new style), which has been invoked against his memory several times in\r\nrecent years, although it was never put in execution. On Néobar's death in\r\n1540, Robert Estienne succeeded him as king's printer for Greek, retaining\r\nthe title for Latin and Hebrew.\r\n\r\nThe king's fondness for the classics did not lead him to neglect the\r\nFrench language: in 1539 he promulgated a celebrated ordinance, to the\r\neffect that 'henceforth all decrees, etc., shall be pronounced, recorded,\r\nand delivered to the parties concerned, in the mother tongue.'\r\n\r\nIn 1541, Olivier Mallard, who had acquired all of Tory's typographic\r\nparaphernalia, published a book of Hours of the Virgin, in Latin, octavo,\r\nwith the borders 'à la moderne' to which I referred on page 25. It is\r\ncopied doubtless from the edition put forth by Tory about 1530, which I\r\nhave never been fortunate enough to see. Of the edition of 1541, I have\r\nseen one copy on vellum, and another on paper. It consists of 23 octavo\r\nsheets (signatures A to Y), and has on the title-page: 'Horæ in laudem\r\nbeatissim. Virginis Mariæ ad usum Romanum.' (Pot Cassé) 'Parisiis, apud\r\nOliverium Mallardum, sub signo Vasis effracti.--1541.'\r\n\r\nIn the following year Mallard published another edition of the Hours of\r\nthe Virgin, in quarto, like the one issued by Tory in 1531. I shall speak\r\nof it in detail in its place.[158] Here I will simply say that the book\r\nwas finished in the month of August, 1542.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-second of the same month, Mallard renewed the lease of his\r\nquarters in the Halle aux Blés de Beauce, which lease had been given\r\nnine years earlier to Tory's widow and Martin Féret, at a rental of 122\r\nlivres 10 sous, tournois. The rental was increased for Mallard, who had\r\nto pay 130 livres, plus 4 écus d'or au soleil 'for the time of the said\r\nleasing.'[159] Olivier Mallard did not long enjoy his lease, for he died\r\nthat same year. His last printing, according to La Caille, who writes\r\nthe name Maillard,[160] was a translation of the Dialogues of Plato, by\r\nSimon de Valembert, published in 1542. I have been unable to find this\r\nbook in Paris, but I have seen another, probably of later date, at the\r\nbookshop of M. Techener; it is entitled: 'Le livre de Ange Bologninus, de\r\nla curation des ulceres exterieurs, traduit de latin en francoys.--Paris,\r\nau Pot Cassé, en limprimerie de Olivier Mallard, libraire et imprimeur du\r\nroy. 1542.' It is an octavo of four signatures. As the license is dated\r\nDecember 1, this little book is probably the last one printed by Mallard,\r\nas he was succeeded in the following year, as king's printer for French\r\nworks, by Denis Janot (one of the most skilful printers in Paris), as is\r\nset forth in the letters patent, which will be found in Appendix VII.\r\nAppendix VIII contains a complete list of the king's printers who lived in\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nMallard's typographical apparatus seems to have been acquired\r\nby Jean Kerver, son of the first Thielman Kerver, living on rue\r\nSaint-Jacques,[161] at the sign of the Gril ('sub signo Cratis'), who\r\nprinted several editions of the Hours in octavo, with the borders 'à\r\nla moderne' used by Mallard in 1541. The sign of the Pot Cassé, which\r\nKerver did not need, was adopted by a bookseller of Chartres, named\r\nRichard Cotereau, who seems also to have bought some of Tory's woodcuts\r\nrepresenting that mark. In fact I have seen one, which I have never seen\r\non any of Tory's books, in a book printed in Paris for Cotereau by Nicolas\r\nChrestien; it is: 'Le Coustumier de la baronnye, chastellenie, terre et\r\nseigneurie de Chasteauneuf en Tymerays'; octavo, 1557. The title-page is\r\nan engraving of the Pot Cassé, with the design reversed,[162] like that of\r\nthe title of 'Champ fleury,' but signed with the double cross; and beneath\r\nare the words: 'Pour Richard Cotereau, libraire, demeurant à Chartres, en\r\nla grande rue, à l'enseigne du Pot Cassé.'\r\n\r\nPhilippe Cottereau, evidently the son of Richard, and king's printer at\r\nBlois, used the same mark. I have seen it on a small book printed by him\r\nin 1603: 'Reglement pour l'instruction des proces qui se conduiront au\r\nbailliage et siege presidial de Bloys.' Two octavo sheets.\r\n\r\nIt would seem, however, that the sign of the Pot Cassé, which remained\r\nfor some time longer on the Halle de Beauce, also remained on the house\r\noriginally occupied by Tory, on rue Saint-Jacques, for we find a printer\r\nnamed Michel de la Guierche living at that sign. See, among other works,\r\n'M. T. Ciceronis ad M. Brutum Orat.--Paris, apud Mich. de la Guierche, sub\r\nsigno Vasis effracti, in vico Jacobeo.' Quarto, without date, but with\r\ndocuments of 1542 and 1543.[163] But the Pot Cassé itself does not figure\r\nin his books.\r\n\r\nTory's widow seems to have retained his engraving establishment for\r\na considerable further time. Although engrossed by her numerous\r\nundertakings, she found time nevertheless to have some of her husband's\r\nbooks reprinted, and among others the 'Sommaire de Chroniques d'Egnasius,'\r\nin 1541, 1543, 1544, for the bookseller Charles L'Angelier, and 'Champ\r\nfleury,' in 1549, for the bookseller Gualtherot. I say that she had these\r\nbooks reprinted, but I ought rather to say, perhaps, that she allowed them\r\nto be reprinted, for there is nothing to suggest her coöperation in the\r\nwork. Literary property did not then exist.\r\n\r\nIn the new edition of 'Champ fleury,' which by the way no longer bears\r\nthat graceful title, the Pot Cassé does not even appear, although\r\nthe explanation of the mark is allowed to remain. It was doubtless a\r\nbookseller's speculation.[164] However that may be, this reprint forms\r\nan octavo volume of 160 leaves (the folio has 80), in addition to the\r\npreliminary matter, of which there are 16 leaves (8 in the folio); it is\r\nentitled: 'L'Art et Science de la vraye proportion des Lettres Attiques,\r\nou Antiques, autrement dictes Romaines, selon le corps et visaige humain,\r\navec l'instruction et maniere de faire chiffres et lettres pour bagues\r\nd'or, pour tapisserie, vitres et painctures. Item de treize diverses\r\nsortes et façons de lettres; d'avantage la maniere d'ordonner la langue\r\nfrançoise par certaine regle de parler elegamment en bon et plus sain\r\nlangage françois que par cy-devant, avec figures à ce convenantes, et\r\nautres choses dignes de memoire, comme on pourra veoir par la table, le\r\ntout inventé par maistre Geoffroy Tory de Bourges.'\r\n\r\nI have copied this long title at full length only to give myself an\r\nopportunity to call attention to the progress that had been made by\r\nFrench typography since the day when Geofroy Tory published his first\r\nedition, and, indeed, as a result of that same publication. We find here\r\nthe accents, the apostrophe and the cedilla, upon the absence of which\r\nthe author had commented in 1529. So that we may say that the whole\r\ngrammatical portion of his book had become useless as a direct result of\r\nthe first edition of that book. This is a fact to which the editors of the\r\nsecond edition paid no heed, as they allowed Tory's observations to stand\r\nas they were written, while introducing into their text the novel signs I\r\nhave just mentioned. For instance, they repeat that _c_ has two sounds,\r\none hard, as in 'coquin,' etc., the other soft, as in 'françois,' etc.\r\nBut by adding the cedilla in the last word they destroy the sense of the\r\ncriticism made by Tory in 1529.[165]\r\n\r\nIt does not appear by whom the book was printed; we learn only on the\r\nlast leaf that it was finished August 26, 1549, 'pour Vivant Gualtherot,\r\nlibraire juré en l'Université de Paris, en la rue Saint-Jacques, à\r\nl'enseigne de Saint Martin.'\r\n\r\nIn order to adjust Tory's woodcuts to the smaller format, they were\r\nsomewhat mutilated; indeed some of them were omitted altogether, among\r\nthe number those representing the Pot Cassé, which probably remained in\r\nthe possession of Olivier Mallard or his successors, and which it was\r\nnot deemed essential to have engraved anew for this reprint, for it was\r\nexecuted as cheaply as possible, and as if for the purpose of utilizing\r\nsuch woodcuts as remained at the disposal of Tory's widow.[166] The work\r\nwas subjected to some further modifications in this edition. For instance,\r\nall dates were suppressed in the preliminary matter, which also was\r\narranged in a different order. Even the license granted by François I was\r\nomitted as having become useless; but no change was made in the actual\r\narrangement of the work, nor was there a single addition or emendation.\r\n\r\nThus Tory, at his death, was able to flatter himself that he had\r\ncontributed materially to the improvement of his mother tongue, which he\r\nloved so well. He died, as I have said, in 1533, and not in 1550, as is\r\nerroneously stated in a poetical epitaph composed nearly a century after\r\nour printer's death, by his compatriot, Nicolas Catherinot, at the request\r\nand from the notes of Jean Toubeau, himself a printer of Bourges, and a\r\ndescendant of Tory, through his mother.\r\n\r\nHere is the epitaph, as given by La Caille:[167]--\r\n\r\n                          To Geofroy Tory,\r\n                          Born at Bourges,\r\n                          Educated at Paris,\r\n            Accomplished Scholar in both Latin and Greek,\r\n                  Most devoted Lover of Letters,\r\n                        Very expert Printer\r\n                                And\r\n                          Learned Author,\r\n    Inasmuch as he wrote elegant Distichs on the Parts of the House,\r\n      Composed some humorous Epitaphs in Latin in very ancient Style,\r\n          Translated Treatises of Xenophon, Lucian, and Plutarch\r\n                        From Greek into French,\r\n          Taught Philosophy at Paris in the College of Burgundy,\r\n        Was the first Man to discuss seriously the Art of Printing,\r\n      Described the Forms of the Letters, or Characters, of the Alphabet,\r\n                    Taught Garamond, Chief of Engravers,\r\n        Always performed the Duties of a good Man until he died\r\n                        In the Year MDL:[168]\r\n                          At the Instance\r\n                        Of Jean Toubeau,\r\n                    Likewise Printer and Author,\r\n                              Mayor,\r\n                      Alderman of Bourges,\r\n               Ambassador on very delicate State-matters\r\n                       To the King and Council,\r\n                 Great-great-grandson of the same Tory,\r\n               Heir of a famous Printing Establishment,\r\n             Nicolas Catherinot, noble Citizen of Bourges,\r\n    Counsellor of the King, and Senator, in the Metropolis of Bourges,\r\n        From his tender Years uninterruptedly to the present Day\r\n          Most closely associated with the Business of Printing,\r\n    Wrote this Epitaph, hastily and rapidly, at the End of November,\r\n                             MDCLXXXIV.[169]\r\n\r\nThe only relic that we have of Tory to-day, outside of his books and\r\nworks of art, is a volume from his library, as his signature in the\r\ngenitive case indicates. It is a manuscript on vellum, containing the\r\norations of Cicero against Verres, in Latin. This volume was acquired,\r\npresumably after Tory's death, by his patron Jean Grolier, who wrote his\r\nmotto at the end of the text: 'Joannis Grolierii Lugdunensis et amicorum.'\r\nFrom the library of this illustrious bibliophile, the manuscript passed to\r\nColbert's library, then to the king's. It is preserved to-day [1857] in\r\nthe Bibliothèque Nationale. We give below a facsimile of Tory's signature,\r\nwhich appears on the first flyleaf:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: God. Torini Biturici]\r\n\r\nTory made use of ten marks, besides the Pot Cassé that appears on his\r\nbindings. We reproduce them all, although only two (nos. 5 and 10) are\r\nsigned.[170] Some of them were used by other booksellers after him, as we\r\nhave already seen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 2]\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 1\r\n\r\nThis mark is to be found in the borders of the Hours (quarto) of 1527.\r\n(See page 37, supra.)\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 2\r\n\r\nThis form of the Pot Cassé appears in the borders of the Hours (quarto) of\r\n1524-1525, alike in the copies which bear the imprint of Tory and in those\r\nprinted by Simon de Colines.

(See\r\np. 41, supra.) The presence of the Lorraine cross is, it seems to me, a\r\nsufficient proof that it should be attributed to Tory. (Silvestre, no.\r\n929.)\r\n\r\nWe have already observed that Tory was not only a bookseller and printer,\r\nbut a binder as well. To complete the list of our artist's professional\r\nacquirements an example of the toolings that he used to decorate the\r\ncovers of some of the volumes bound by him, is reproduced [on the cover\r\nof the present volume.[173] The reproduction is from the cover of a copy\r\nof the works of Petrarch, printed at Venice in 1525, and now preserved\r\nin the Library of the British Museum.] The Pot Cassé, in its simplest\r\nform, appears among the arabesques of this binding. Tory had also had\r\nengraved a larger plate of the same, for use on the binding of quartos,\r\nor, rather, of folios. The design is almost identical. Sometimes the\r\nPot Cassé is accompanied by the drill. This design appears on a copy of\r\nMacault's translation of Diodorus Siculus, printed as late as 1536, 'au\r\nPot Cassé.' This beautiful volume, in M. Didot's magnificent library, is\r\nsufficient proof that Tory's widow continued his various industries for a\r\nconsiderable time.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to say that the same tools could, with some slight\r\nadditions, be used in binding volumes of all sizes, from the octavo up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: I write these two names as our artist himself wrote them;\r\nbut it is a well-known fact that the orthography of proper names in the\r\nsixteenth century was very uncertain. As to the family name especially,\r\nGeofroy's ancestors and descendants wrote it indifferently _Toury_,\r\n_Tory_, and _Thory_; but Geofroy never varied: he always wrote _Tory_ in\r\nFrench, _Torinus_ in Latin (which should, strictly speaking, be translated\r\n_Torin_).

There\r\nis but one little flaw in this story, namely, that the dates are against\r\nit: _Champ fleury_ antedates _Pantagruel_, by several years. This fact,\r\nto be sure, does not prove that Rabelais did not make Tory a character\r\nin his work; but what foundation is there, I ask, for attributing the\r\ncharacter of Raminagrobis to Tory? Simply the assertion of one of those\r\nseventeenth-century scribblers of marginal notes who lived on the great\r\nauthors of the sixteenth as rats live on the most valuable manuscripts--by\r\nnibbling at them. What possible connection is there between Raminagrobis,\r\ncanon and poet, whom Rabelais represents as dying about 1546, and Tory,\r\nlayman and prose writer, who died twelve years earlier? Does it not remind\r\none of the famous key to _Astrée_, of which I had occasion to prove, in\r\nmy monograph upon the d'Urfés, that not a word was true? Almost the same\r\ncourse has been pursued with reference to the _Satire Menippée_, which has\r\nin our own day been ascribed to persons who would be greatly surprised,\r\nand far from proud of their alleged work. See what I had to say on this\r\nsubject in the _Revue de la Province et de Paris_ of September 30, 1842.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: _Champ fleury_, 'Aux Lecteurs.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: It was Pasquier, I think, who first gave currency to this\r\nfable; and his opinion is the less admissible because he did not even know\r\nTory's name, but calls him 'Georges Toré.'

This work is divided into\r\nfour books and contains engravings not unlike those in _Champ fleury_.\r\nM.

Roma,\r\nper invenzione di Lodovico Vicentino_, in quarto (1523). As for the\r\nvariant spelling of the author's name, which Tory calls Vincentino, it\r\nis explainable; for we find in the Libri catalogue of 1857: _Ragola\r\nda imparare scrivere varii caratteri di lettere, di L. Vincentino_.\r\n(Venetia, Zoppino, 1533, in quarto.) I have also seen mentioned a work\r\nof the same sort entitled: _Regula occulte scribendi seu componendi\r\ncipharam itaquenemo litteras interpretari possit communes omnibus, inventa\r\net composita a domino Jacobo Silvestro sive Florentino_. (Rome, 1526,\r\nquarto.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: The doubt expressed by Tory is due to the fact that he was\r\nunable to read the text of Dürer's work, which was published in German in\r\n1525.

We\r\ncan establish the fact of his existence so late as 1522 by the documents\r\npublished by M. de Laborde in his book on the Renaissance.

['Brief instructions\r\nfor writing the French language properly.'] This curious work, which is\r\nprinted with the _Miroir de très chrestienne princesse Marguerite de\r\nFrance_, in an octavo volume, 1533, informs us among other things that\r\nthe final E which requires the acute accent was at that time called\r\n_masculine_, and that the word _feminine_ was applied to it when it did\r\nnot take the accent. These are, as we see, the terms used by Tory. Hence\r\ndoubtless the term _féminine_, which is still applied to-day, in French\r\npoetry, to silent rhymes.

(From a roll not dated, but _circa_ 1538, published by\r\nM. de Laborde, _Renaissance des Arts_, vol. i, p. 924.) These Mallards\r\nwere probably of Norman origin, for there were about the same time several\r\nbooksellers of that name at Rouen. One of them, indeed, Jean Mallard, had\r\nthe Pot Cassé for his sign in 1542. He was probably a brother of Olivier,\r\nwho had authorized him to adopt that symbol.

AUTHOR\r\n    LUCULENTISSIMUS, NUNQUAM ANTEA CITRA MONTES IMPRESSUS.[174]\r\n    (Mark of Jehan Petit.)[175]\r\n\r\nQuarto, of 45 numbered leaves, plus 11 leaves of index; in all, 56 leaves,\r\nor 14 sheets, arranged in 9 signatures of two sheets and one, alternately.\r\nSignatures _a_, _c_, _e_, _g_, and _i_ have two sheets [16 pages] each;\r\nsignatures _b_, _d_, _f_, _h_, one sheet [8 pages] each.\r\n\r\nThe whole book is printed in roman type, except the first line of the\r\ntitle-page, which is gothic, and a few Greek words here and there.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, this book was for sale by Jean Petit, but it was printed\r\nby Gilles de Gourmont, solely because of the Greek words just mentioned.\r\nSo Tory himself tells us in a note at the end of the text, folio 45:\r\n'Curavi siquidem accuratissimo impressori dare, qui etiam primus apud\r\nParisios græcis caracteribus lotissimas addidit manus.'[176]\r\n\r\nOn the verso of the first leaf is a letter of the publisher, Geofroy Tory,\r\nto his friend Babou, thus conceived:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    BACCHVS\r\n\r\n    CERES ET\r\n\r\n    VENVS\r\n\r\n    SONT ICY\r\n\r\n    MENEZ CA\r\n\r\n    PTIFZ.\r\n]\r\n\r\n    _Geofroy Tory of Bourges to Philibert Babou, citizen of Bourges,\r\n    very deserving treasurer and valet-de-chambre of the most serene\r\n    king of the French, humblest greeting._\r\n\r\nOn looking recently into Pomponius Mela, most illustrious Philibert, Mela\r\nwho is the most trustworthy of the writers on geography, I found him so\r\ncorrupt and so badly mutilated that\r\n\r\n    --Lo, before my eyes, in saddest plight,\r\n    The author seemed to stand and burst in tears.[177]\r\n\r\n    Virg. _Æn._ ii.\r\n\r\n    Lo, I say,\r\n\r\n      All black with dust and blood,--ah, sad, sad sight,--\r\n      By two-horse chariot dragged, his swollen feet\r\n      Torn through with thongs ...\r\n      How from the bottom of his heart he groaned.\r\n\r\n    _Id. Ibid._\r\n\r\nIn such words as these did he seem to complain: Am I, then, who described\r\nso elegantly all those many lands, those many peoples, those islands,\r\nrivers, straits, seas, and whirlpools, I who ventured so confidently upon\r\nthe description of the whole world, am I to remain thus maimed, thus\r\nmutilated, thus disfigured?\r\n\r\n    --Ah me, how hacked am I,\r\n    How like that Hector who erstwhile brought back\r\n    ... his squalid ... locks\r\n    All stiff with blood, and many a wound he got\r\n    About his country's walls.                         _Id. Ibid._\r\n\r\nUnless some helping hand be stretched forth, I shall soon surely die.\r\n\r\n    In time Machaon healed the loathsome limbs of Philoctetes,\r\n      And Phillyreian Chiron gave to blinded Phœnix sight;\r\n    The god of Epidaurus, at a father's fond entreaties,\r\n      By Cretan herbs Androgeos brought again to realms of light.[1]\r\n\r\nBut verily I believe that\r\n\r\n    He who'll cure this pain of mine is certain of succeeding\r\n      In giving Tantalus the fruit that cheats his eager palm.\r\n    Yea, he the piercèd pails may fill, and heavy burden lighten,\r\n      The slender Danaïds endure, with ceaseless toil opprest;\r\n    From the bleak cliff of Caucasus unchain the fettered Titan,\r\n      And scare away the bird of prey that tears his mangled breast.[178]\r\n\r\nI naturally said to myself on the spot: If I were Machaon, or Chyron, or\r\nÆsculapius, I should be glad to remedy this matter. But what if I were to\r\nmake such slight effort as I can? Might I not be able to be of service?\r\nPerhaps; at least, I should have tried, and I should have had this object\r\nin view: to make him somewhat more free from faults.\r\n\r\n    And if my powers of song should fail--to dare were surely fame:\r\n    Enough that I have had the will; no higher praise I claim.\r\n\r\n    Proper. ii, _ad Musam_ (_ad Augustum?_).\r\n\r\n    I have accordingly added a very few annotations; provided with\r\n    which, under the protection of your name (for you are a devoted\r\n    admirer of letters and lettered men), under, as the saying is,\r\n    favourable auspices, let Pomponius Mela now go forth in greater\r\n    security than before. Farewell.\r\n\r\n    Paris, vj no. Decemb. MCCCCCVII.[179]\r\n\r\nAt the end of the text, on folio xlv, we find the following:[180]--\r\n\r\nHere, then, you have, most illustrious Philibert, Pomponius Mela, purged\r\nof the many errors in which he abounded. I took the trouble to put him\r\nin the hands of a very careful printer, one who was, besides, the first\r\nParisian to give to the Greek characters a form of superior elegance. I\r\nhave been pleased to revise the text with special care and to add a very\r\nfew annotations, so that, when it should come into your hands, and later\r\non into the hands of the public, it might come in a more polished and\r\nfinished form. You, now, with Mela in hand, may, like Phiclus, who, as the\r\nstory goes, ran over the tops of the grain-fields without breaking the\r\nears, traverse and re-traverse, not only in security, but confidently and\r\nresolutely, the whole world. If you wish to lay hold of tigers, swiftest\r\nof animals, and to see from a safe vantage the catoblepas, if you wish\r\nto meet dragons and wild beasts, Satyrs, Pans, and Silvani, if you wish\r\nto see the Indians, 'the Britons, separated by a world between,' the\r\nSauromatae, the Africans, and all the peoples that lie between these,\r\nand learn of their wonderful habits, then take but this world, I mean\r\nPomponius, many times in hand, and without doubt you will there be able to\r\nsee and to know them all as in no other way. Farewell and forget not yours\r\never faithfully.\r\n\r\n    Paris, 24 December.\r\n\r\n    CIVIS.\r\n\r\n    _To Pomponius Mela._\r\n\r\n    Mela, the many errors in which you abounded have been cast forth;\r\n    few are the faults that remain with you. Better far and more perfect\r\n    in form do you stand forth now than formerly you did. This is the\r\n    accomplishment of my small hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To Philibert Babou._\r\n\r\n    That my life for many years has been due to you, these two short\r\n    verses, Philibert, now testify. Whatever 'alpha' belonged to me in\r\n    my tender years, that your happy 'omega' wished to bear.\r\n\r\n    Ω\r\n\r\n    CIVIS.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the index, on the verso of the penultimate sheet, is a list\r\nof errata beginning thus:--\r\n\r\n[181] 'Since nothing is more difficult than to be wholly free from\r\nerror, it seems quite proper that I should, with the kind consent of the\r\nreader, consider a very few of the very few mistakes of this book: thus,\r\nfor example, where \"potuit\" is found in the epistle, \"possit\" should be\r\nwritten.'\r\n\r\nThis list also is signed 'civis.' Beneath it is a short poem entitled:\r\n'Carolus Rousseus ad lectorem tetrastichon.' And on the recto of the last\r\nleaf: 'In the year of the incarnation and of our salvation, 1507, the\r\ntenth day of January,[182] this work was printed by Gilles de Gourmont,\r\nand was very carefully revised by Tory of Bourges, at Paris.' (Mark of\r\nGilles de Gourmont.)\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n    COSMOGRAPHIA PII PAPÆ IN ASIÆ ET EUROPÆ ELEGANTI\r\n    DESCRIPTIONE, etc. Paris, Henri Estienne [1509].\r\n\r\nQuarto, of 152 leaves of text, preceded by 12 unnumbered leaves and a\r\nfolio cut representing the ancient world. On the second preliminary leaf\r\nis Tory's dedicatory epistle to Germain de Gannay, thus conceived:\r\n\r\n    _To the reverend Father and Lord in Christ, Germain de Gannay,\r\n    bishop-elect of Cahors, Geofroy Tory of Bourges proffers most humble\r\n    greeting._[183]\r\n\r\n    I here present, most excellent prelate, in more accurate and emended\r\n    form than that in which he has hitherto been read, Pope Pius, an\r\n    author who, in his Description of Asia and Europe, is much to be\r\n    admired both for the dignity and for the singular worth of his\r\n    work. In looking for some one to whom he, in behalf of his book,\r\n    freshly issuing from the printing-office, might straightway most\r\n    devotedly offer his respects, some one select, devoted to letters,\r\n    and possessed of the highest virtue, I could think of no one more to\r\n    be desired, more worthy than you. That the Supreme Pontiff himself\r\n    should go to visit you, a most venerable bishop, seemed to me a\r\n    thing not without humour. That he, I say, who was a meritorious\r\n    writer of geography, and, as you will be able to see, of history\r\n    well deserving to be read, should come and embrace you, lover and\r\n    cultivator of every form of polite literature, I thought a thing\r\n    very appropriate. It was like setting the gem to the gold, or the\r\n    'encaustum,' that is picture drawn with fire, to the silver, it was\r\n    like conferring the palm upon the victor; and that most certainly\r\n    is nothing other than to join the good to the good, the glorious to\r\n    the glorious, the deserving to the deserving. But along with these\r\n    reasons there is still another reason why to you of all persons\r\n    this most illustrious work should very properly be dedicated: it\r\n    was at your instance and suggestion that I divided the work into\r\n    chapters and gave to its parts a more convenient arrangement.\r\n    That you first, and then that all other students and readers, may,\r\n    as was your wish, find and remember the parts of the earth, which\r\n    are many in number, and the things in them that are interesting\r\n    to know about, more easily and conveniently, I have divided the\r\n    book thus: the names of rivers, towns, places, rulers, and other\r\n    important matters I have put in separate chapters and marked with\r\n    marginal captions; these names are also all to be found, provided\r\n    with numbers, in the index. This little work of mine, therefore,\r\n    I dedicate to you, my lord, in deepest reverence and with sincere\r\n    feeling. It is certainly far from being what I should offer to so\r\n    reverend a father, but you, whose goodness and integrity, which are\r\n    perfectly evident to me, all praise in the highest terms, will, if\r\n    it so please you, take the book into your most pure hands and bestow\r\n    upon it the favour which you are accustomed to bestow upon works of\r\n    this kind. Farewell.\r\n\r\n    Paris, at the College of Plessis, 2 Oct., A.D. 1509.\r\n\r\nNext comes a 'table,' which fills eleven leaves, on the verso of the last\r\nof which we find the following note to the reader:--\r\n\r\n    _Geofroy Tory of Bourges to the Reader._[184]\r\n\r\n    You will find the words 'eruȩre, contendȩre, misȩre,'\r\n    and many others of the same sort, written with an _ȩ_ in the\r\n    penult: this was done in order that the perfect indicative, which\r\n    regularly has a long penult, might show its quantity (which\r\n    you are to utter in reading), as distinguished from that of\r\n    the present and past imperfect infinitive, which in the third\r\n    conjugation always shortens its penult. It is with pleasure that\r\n    I have imitated and adopted the very elegant and finished form of\r\n    writing which is used in the 'Psalterium Quincuplex,'[185] recently\r\n    published. You will also, though rarely, find this _ȩ_ used,\r\n    after the fashion of certain authors, for _æ_ in some words, and\r\n    similarly at times in the genitive and dative singular, and in the\r\n    nominative and vocative plural, of the first declension. I have\r\n    furthermore written designedly 'mistum' with an _s_ instead of an\r\n    _x_,--for 'misceo' makes its perfect 'miscui,' whence by analogy\r\n    'mistum,'--'intellego,' 'toties,' 'quoties,' 'litus,' 'opidum,'\r\n    'litera,' 'tralatum,' 'aliquando,' and other similar forms, which\r\n    are to be written according to ὀρθογραϕία, that is to\r\n    say, correct spelling. The word 'Turca' also, which many make in\r\n    the second declension, I have written in the first. I follow herein\r\n    with approval Michael Tarchaniota Marulus of Constantinople in his\r\n    lines addressed to Charles, King of France. These are his words:\r\n    'Invincible king, scion of the race of Charles the Great, whom the\r\n    holy prophecies of so many men, of so many gods, demand as the\r\n    vindicator of fallen justice and loyalty; whom here the sad Ausonian\r\n    land, there Greece with streaming locks, calls, and whate'er of Asia\r\n    and wealthy Syria the cruel Turk profanes,' etc.\r\n\r\n    In writing the accusatives 'plureis,' 'parteis,' 'omneis,'\r\n    'monteis,' in '_eis_,' I have believed that I was writing good\r\n    grammar and good Latin, following therein Priscian, book 7, the\r\n    chapter on the accusative plural of the third declension. This form\r\n    is valuable for distinguishing the accusative from the nominative,\r\n    and has been used by a thousand authors, of which great number it\r\n    is sufficient at present to cite as witnesses Sallust, Virgil,\r\n    and Plautus. Sallust, who used the first word also, says in the\r\n    Catilinarian War: 'Omneis homines qui sese,' etc. Virgil in the\r\n    first Æneid: 'Hic fessas non vincula naveis Ulla tenent....' Plautus\r\n    in the Aulularia: 'Quid est? quid ridetis novi omneis, scio fures\r\n    hic esse complureis.' I have been pleased to make this explanation,\r\n    good reader, so that you not only might know what pure speech is,\r\n    but also, both in reading and in speaking, might have pleasantly at\r\n    hand, like finger-posts, and might use, pure words. Farewell.\r\n\r\n    CIVIS.\r\n\r\nOn folio 152, after the errata, we read: 'Impressa est hæc Asiæ et\r\nEuropæ quam elegantissima historia per Henricum Stephanum, impressorem\r\ndiligentissimum, Parrhisiis, e regione scholæ decretorum, sumptibus\r\neiusdem Henrici et Ioannis Hongonti,[186] VI idus Octobris anno\r\nDomini M. D.

He\r\n    it is who introduced you to the Muses, Helicon, Phœbus' grove, and\r\n    Mercury, and from his school, as from the Trojan horse, have issued\r\n    men of education without number. His heart is in the Muses' glorious\r\n    service, and his memory, it seems to me, should be forever honoured\r\n    and kept green. He is reported, as the saying is, to have toiled\r\n    not only by the lamp of Aristophanes, but by that of Cleanthes as\r\n    well.[191] You do not doubt that he is deserving of praise for the\r\n    elegance of his song; whence it happens that there is a religious\r\n    poem of his written on the Passion of Our Lord,--a poem of such\r\n    brilliancy, such sweetness, such ornateness, that one could believe\r\n    it to be the work of the divine, rather than of a human, mind. I\r\n    do not doubt that, as a result of this fact, the same thing will\r\n    fall to his lot that usually falls to the lot of literary men:\r\n    as Claudian says, 'His presence will diminish his fame.'[192]\r\n    Not, however, without Theseus,[193] that is Tory of Bourges, my\r\n    fellow-student, a man of the old, and, as Plautus says, of the\r\n    Massilian, school,[194] one who combines sound learning with virtue,\r\n    have I wished Dives to issue forth into the world; again, I hope,\r\n    with favourable auspices, as the saying is. Farewell, with best\r\n    wishes.\r\n\r\n    From my house at Amand, 1 March.\r\n\r\nThen follows the elegy by Wilhelm de Ricke, which has 140 verses and\r\noccupies 4 leaves; on the verso of the last of the four is this dialogue\r\nin verse by Tory:--\r\n\r\n    _Dialogue by Geofroy Tory of Bourges in praise of his teacher,\r\n    Wilhelm de Ricke of Ghent._[195]\r\n\r\n    _Speakers_: MONITOR _and_ LIBER.\r\n\r\n    M. Sacred book, who in song mourn Christ's Passion, now\r\n    speak: whose holy work can you be?\r\n\r\n    L. Whose work? Behold! Rich's work am I.\r\n\r\n    M. Well done! That Rich who to the people of Bourges has\r\n    given so many rich examples?\r\n\r\n    L. You judge rightly.\r\n\r\n    M. Rich truly has a wise heart.\r\n\r\n    L. No fitter name than this can be given him.\r\n\r\n    M. He it is who taught the people of Bourges to speak with\r\n    flowery tongue and to make facile verses with the mouth.\r\n\r\n    L. He not only taught them to speak and to weave song, but\r\n    he also gave them the power to see Christ's wounded body.\r\n\r\n    M. If one wished to see the arms of God fixed to the cross,\r\n    could even Rich grant him that to the life?\r\n\r\n    L. Should you desire to carry the cross of God, his cruel\r\n    wounds, the crown, hold me in hand, you will carry all.\r\n\r\n    M. May Rich's every prayer be ever happily granted, such\r\n    good he grants to pious hearts.\r\n\r\n    L. May he live and continue on earth through Nestorian\r\n    years, and after death gain the rich kingdom of Heaven.\r\n\r\n    CIVIS.\r\n\r\nThe little book comes to an end with the poem by Lactantius mentioned on\r\nthe title-page. It fills the third and second last leaves, and the recto\r\nof the last, at the foot of which we read: 'Finis. Ex ædibus Ascensianis\r\nad v idus martias MDIX.' This date corresponds with March 11,\r\n1510, new style.\r\n\r\nM. Jules de Saint-Genois, librarian of the University of Ghent, writes me\r\nas follows concerning his fellow-townsman, the author of the verses on the\r\nPassion:--\r\n\r\n'The name of the person in whom you are interested was not le Riche, but\r\nde Rycke, in Flemish, which in the Latin rendering becomes Dives. This\r\nis what Sanderus says of him in \"Flandria Illustrata,\" 1, 386 (edition\r\nHagæ-Comitis, 1735): \"Gulielmus Dives, vulgo de Rycke, Gandavensis poeta:\r\nejus exstat 'Carmen elegiacum de Passione Dominica,' artificiosæ pietatis\r\nplenissimum, quod inter illustrium poetarum opera impressit Judocus Badius\r\nAscensius Parisiis.\"\r\n\r\n'Valère André, too, devotes a few lines to him in his \"Bibliotheca\r\nBelgica\" (Lovanii, 1623, p. 344): \"Elegiam de Passione Dominica edidit\r\nAntverpiæ cum Dominici Mancini, Phil. Beroaldi et aliorum similis\r\nargumenti libellis, 1527, Mich. Hellenii typis.\"\r\n\r\n'P. Hofmann Peerlkamp says in his \"Liber de vita, doctrina et facultate\r\nNederlandorum qui carmina latina composuerunt\" (2d edition, Harlem,\r\n1838, p. 29): \"Gulielmus Dives Gandensis floruit 1520. Scripsit 'Carmen\r\nelegiacum de Passione Dominica,' artificiosæ pietatis plenissimum....\r\nHæc sæpius prodiit, addita etiam _Quatuor virtutibus_ Dominici Mancini,\r\nAntverpiæ, a. 1562. Si vocabulum his illic excipias minus latinum, Carmen\r\nest melioris notæ quam multa ejusdem temporis de hoc argumento.\"\r\n\r\n'As for the edition which you mention, said to have been printed \"in\r\nædibus Ascensianis,\" in 1509, the library does not own it; but Gulielmus\r\nDives' little poem is printed in \"Dominici Mancini Poemata,\" Antverpiæ,\r\n1559, 12mo.'\r\n\r\nThis is all that I have been able to learn concerning Guillaume le Riche\r\nor de Rycke; we do not know how this burgess of Ghent became a professor\r\nat Bourges. And yet the fact itself is not extraordinary, for, not long\r\nafter, about 1530, another Belgian, named Hanneton, gave instruction in\r\nfeudal law there.\r\n\r\nTory published also at the end of his edition of Valerius Probus [see\r\nnumber 5, infra], the following Latin distich,--an enigma,--written by his\r\nmaster:--\r\n\r\n    Dic age, quæ volucres gignunt animalia foetæe\r\n      Et præbent natis ubera plena suis?[196]\r\n\r\nAs for Herverus de Berna, Tory's fellow-pupil, I know even less of him.\r\nAll that I have been able to learn is that he published in 1543 a short\r\npoem in praise of the dukes of Nevers, lords of Orval near Saint-Amand,\r\nwhere Herverus was born, and of which he was then curé, if I read aright\r\nhis bombastic Latin. This is the title of the book, which was for sale at\r\nthe shop of Vivant Gualtherot: 'Panegyricon illustrissimorum principum\r\ncomitum Druydarum et Aurivallensium et Nivernensium, Hervero a Berna,\r\ncurione Amandino Allifero, auctore. Parisiis, 1543.' (I fancy that the\r\nwords 'curione Amandino Allifero' mean: curé of Saint-Amand-l'Allier, now\r\nSaint-Amand-Montrond.)\r\n\r\nThe work is dedicated to a friend of the author, and perhaps of Tory as\r\nwell, named Nicolas Rocheus (La Roche?), described as 'Apollineæ artis\r\ndoctor eximius' in the dedicatory epistle, which is dated: 'Tumultuarie,\r\nex ædibus nostris Amandinis, kalendis ianuarii, 1542.'\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n    BEROSUS BABILONENSIS, DE HIS QUÆ PRÆCESSERUNT INUNDATIONEM\r\n    TERRARUM; ITEM MYRSILUS, DE ORIGINE TURRENORUM, etc.\r\n\r\nQuarto, Paris, 1510; with the small mark of the Marnefs (the\r\nPelican),[197] with the letters E. I. G.\r\n\r\nThis work, which was printed by J. Marchand, at the expense of Geofroy de\r\nMarnef, bookseller and publisher, was prepared for the press by Geofroy\r\nTory, who placed at the beginning the following letter:--\r\n\r\n    _To the most distinguished Philibert Babou, Geofroy Tory of Bourges,\r\n    heartiest greeting._[198]\r\n\r\n    Last year, when I was attending to the printing of Pope Pius's\r\n    Cosmography, the idea occurred to me of thoroughly revising and\r\n    handing to the printer at an early date the Babylonian Berosus's\r\n    work on the 'Antiquities of the Kingdoms'; but, my mind at that\r\n    time taking another turn, I determined to postpone this work, for\r\n    the reason that I had a project of almost divine character on\r\n    hand; and indeed I should have postponed it for a long time,--as\r\n    the saying is, to the Greek Calends,--had not Berosus himself, so\r\n    to speak, and, what is and always will be of no little importance\r\n    to me, a number of my friends, daily whispering in my ear, as it\r\n    were, their prayers, demanded of me most earnestly that I should\r\n    print, along with Berosus, Myrsilus 'De origine Turrenorum,' Cato's\r\n    fragments, Archilochus, Metasthenes, Philo, Xenophon 'De æquivocis,'\r\n    Sempronius, Fabius Pictor, and Antoninus Pius's fragments of the\r\n    'Itinerarium.' There is a very avaricious class of human beings,\r\n    which, if it has a book--a book that is hard to find--consisting of\r\n    three or four short lines, straightway,--like the ants of India, or\r\n    the griffins, which are fabled to carry gold to a remote spot and\r\n    there keep watch over it, threatening with dire destruction any one\r\n    who attempts to touch it,--carries it off and guards it, and loading\r\n    it with chains and fetters, keeps it imprisoned like a miserable\r\n    captive. Such people ought to display their officious greed--the\r\n    greed of possessing something unique all to one's self--in company\r\n    with the ants and griffins, which other people avoid, rather than to\r\n    continue their incivility, or perhaps I should rather say immunity,\r\n    among human beings. We are born not alone for ourselves: we owe\r\n    something also to our friends, something to our country. Therefore,\r\n    that it may not seem to be my desire to extinguish the brilliant\r\n    light of a burning lamp, I the more willingly, under your name,\r\n    Philibert, most illustrious citizen of Bourges, send forth Berosus's\r\n    'Antiquities,' together with the other authors mentioned above, for\r\n    the common study of all, and I believe that I shall therein be doing\r\n    an act that will gain the gratitude, in some small measure, of my\r\n    country. Farewell.\r\n\r\n    Paris, at the College of Plessis, 2 May, 1510.\r\n\r\n    CIVIS.\r\n\r\nTory's letter is dated May 2, 1510; but the printing of the book was not\r\nfinished until the ninth of that month, as we see by the subscription of\r\nthe first edition; for there were at least three distinct editions in\r\nTory's name, to say nothing of a multitude of others issued by different\r\npublishers. Annius of Viterbo, otherwise known as Jean Nanni, had recently\r\nbrought into fashion the fables of Berosus, which he attempted to palm off\r\nas an ancient work; and scholars were still at odds as to the authenticity\r\nof the book, the sale of which their discussions aided to maintain. Tory\r\nseems to have taken sides with Annius of Viterbo, as he himself prepared\r\nan edition of the supposititious Berosus, the preface of which we have\r\njust quoted. We have said that there were three editions in his name. They\r\nmay be described thus:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_First Edition_\r\n\r\nQuarto; 28 leaves numbered in Arabic figures, and 4 preliminary leaves.\r\n\r\nFolio 1 recto, title: 'Berosus Babilonicus, de his quæ præcesserunt\r\ninundationem terrarum; item Myrsilus, de origine Turrenorum; Cato, in\r\nfragmentis; Archilocus, in epitheto de temporibus; Metasthenes, de judicio\r\ntemporum; Philo, in breviario temporum; Xenophon, de equivocis temporum;\r\nSempronius, de divisione Italiæ; Q. Fab. Pictor, de aureo seculo et\r\norigine urbis Romæ; fragmentum itinerarii Antonini Pii; altercatio Adriani\r\nAugusti et Epictici.' Then comes the mark of the Marnefs, with the letters\r\nE. I. G., and the words 'Le Pelican' in a scroll at the left. (No. 15 of\r\nM. Silvestre's 'Marques Typographiques.')\r\n\r\nOn the verso of this leaf is Tory's letter, quoted above. Four unnumbered\r\nintercalated leaves follow, containing the table of contents and a list of\r\nerrata.\r\n\r\nFolio 2, recto: 'Berosus, de his quæ præscesserunt inundationem terrarum.'\r\n\r\nThe articles mentioned on the title-page follow, up to folio 28, where we\r\nfind these words:--\r\n\r\n'Impressum est hoc opus Parrhisiis, in Bellovisu, per Joannem\r\nMarchant, impensis Godofredi de Marnef, anno Domini 1510, septimo idus\r\nmaias.[199]--CIVIS.'\r\n\r\n\r\n_Second Edition_\r\n\r\nQuarto; 4 unnumbered preliminary leaves, and 30 leaves of text numbered in\r\nroman figures; in all, 34 printed leaves.\r\n\r\nOn the first of the unnumbered leaves is the title, 'Berosus Babilonicus,'\r\netc. (as in the first edition), but with the following additional words:\r\n'Vertumniana Propertii. Manethon.' Same mark as in the first edition, but\r\nsmaller.[200]\r\n\r\nOn the second leaf, Tory's letter. On the verso of this leaf the index\r\nbegins, and fills the two leaves following.\r\n\r\nFolio i. 'Berosus,' etc. The text corresponds with that of the first\r\nedition[201] to folio xxvii, where the additions begin.\r\n\r\n    Fol. xxvii, recto. End of the 'Altercatio.'\r\n                verso. 'Vertumniana Propertii.'\r\n        xxviii, verso. 'Manethonis, prima pars.'\r\n\r\nFol. xxx (not numbered), several pieces of verse [not mentioned on the\r\ntitle-page], perhaps by Tory, but not signed:--\r\n\r\n1. 'Ad reverendissimum ac religiosissimum Arturum Calphurnium, Sancti\r\nGeorgii de Nemore antistitem.'\r\n\r\n2. 'Ad eruditissimum Nicolaum Corbinum, Vindocinensis plage judicem.'\r\n\r\n3. 'Ad bonarum literarum vere amatorem amicum sibi fidelem Philippum\r\nMorinensem.'\r\n\r\nThis edition, which seems never to have been described by any bibliophile,\r\nis in the Bibliothèque Mazarine, and at Sainte-Geneviève. It was\r\nundoubtedly published in 1511, but it bears no indication of its date.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Third Edition_\r\n\r\nQuarto; 6 preliminary leaves, unnumbered, and 51 leaves numbered in roman\r\nfigures, divided into ten signatures (A to K), containing alternately one\r\nand a half and two leaves. In all, 57 printed leaves, and one blank.\r\n\r\nOn the first unnumbered leaf is the title: 'Berosus,' etc. (as in the\r\nfirst edition), but with the following addition: 'Cornelii Taciti\r\nde origine et situ Germanorum opusculum. C. C. de situ et moribus\r\nGermanorum.--Anno Domini 1511.' Then follows a shocking imitation of the\r\nmark of the Marnefs in the first edition. The gothic initials E and G are\r\nchanged to C and O, and the I, which in the other editions stands between\r\nthe E and the G, is omitted. The words 'Le Pelican,' in a scroll at the\r\nleft, are reduced to the three letters L, P, and A, the foreign artist\r\nhaving been either unable or unwilling to read what was printed on the\r\ncopy put before him, which, it is true, may have been imperfect. The first\r\ndecorated letter, also, has been copied, in order to deceive the reader,\r\nwho, if we may judge from appearances, was assumed to be seeking the\r\nedition prepared by Tory.\r\n\r\nOn the second leaf is the letter of the editor, from which the word\r\n'civis,' Tory's device, has been omitted, the foreign printer apparently\r\nnot knowing its meaning. The four leaves following are taken up with the\r\ntable of contents.\r\n\r\nFolio i of the text: 'Berosus,' etc. The text which follows corresponds\r\nwith that of the first edition down to folio xxxii (erroneously numbered\r\nxxxiii), which ends with the word 'finis.'\r\n\r\nOn folio xxxiii recto, the work of Tacitus mentioned above ['Germania']\r\nbegins. Next, on folio xliii verso, a work in verse by Conrad Celtès,\r\nthe title of which is given above, and on folio xlviii, another work, in\r\nprose, by the same author, with this title: 'Ex libro C. C. de situ et\r\nmoribus Norimberge, de Herciniæ silvæ magnitudine, et de eius in Europa\r\ndefinitione et populis incolis.'\r\n\r\nThere is nothing to indicate where the book was printed; but everything\r\nleads me to believe that it is a German counterfeit. My opinion is based\r\nupon, first, the stupid imitation of the printer's mark of the first\r\nedition; second, the omission of Tory's device at the end of the letter;\r\nthird, the additions, all of which relate to Germany; fourth, the fact\r\nthat two of the three known copies of this edition were recently to be\r\nfound in the same country. One belonged to Panzer, who has described it\r\nin his 'Annales Typographiques'[202]; I do not know what has become of\r\nit; a second copy was formerly in the library of M. Bunau,[203] whence it\r\npassed to the Dresden Library; the third is in Paris, in the Bibliothèque\r\nNationale, which also possesses a copy of the first edition. It was by\r\ncomparing the two editions that I discovered the fraud committed by the\r\nprinter of the edition of 1511 with respect to the typographical mark.\r\nThe description of this mark given by Panzer, with that courteously\r\nsent me from Dresden by the learned bibliographer Herr Graesse, before\r\nI was aware of the existence of the copy of the third edition in the\r\nBibliothèque Nationale, had utterly baffled such bibliographical knowledge\r\nas I possess. I sought a meaning for the letters inscribed on the mark\r\nin the third edition; of course I could not find any. M. Brunet has\r\nsince produced a facsimile of this mark, in the fifth edition of his\r\n'Manuel.'[204]\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n    VALERII PROBI GRAMMATICI DE INTERPRETANDIS ROMANORUM LITERIS\r\n    OPUSCULUM, CUM ALIIS QUIBUSDAM SCITU DIGNISSIMIS, FŒLICITER\r\n    INCIPIT.--Mark: Marnef's E. I. G. (Silvestre, no. 974.)\r\n\r\nOctavo; 6 printed sheets (signatures A to I). Paris, E. I. G. de Marnef\r\n[1510]. This book was probably printed by Gilles de Gourmont, for we find\r\nin it his unaccented Greek type. It contains two engravings on wood,--the\r\nmark on the title-page, and a Roman portico farther on. There are also\r\nsome small cuts engraved on metal in one of the pieces; but none of them\r\nhave any artistic merit, and they cannot be attributed to Tory.\r\n\r\nOn the verso of the title is the following letter, addressed by Tory to\r\ntwo of his old college friends, who were at this time personages of note:\r\nthe first, Philibert Babou, was secretary and silversmith to the king; the\r\nsecond, Jean Lallemand, was Mayor of Bourges.\r\n\r\n    _Geofroy Tory of Bourges to the most illustrious Philibert Babou and\r\n    Jean Lallemand, the younger, citizens of Bourges, united in mutual\r\n    friendship, greeting._[205]\r\n\r\n    I owe to you, most estimable of men, the fruit of whatever toil\r\n    I may undertake--even purposely for your sakes--by night or day.\r\n    Behold! Since you in no slight degree practise and admire the\r\n    old school of morals, the school, that is, of respectability\r\n    and true worth, I now, under the protection of your names, ever\r\n    to be cherished by me, commit to print Probus Valerius, a most\r\n    diligent collector and accurate interpreter of the old writings and\r\n    abbreviations which appear, elegantly drawn, on the ancient coins,\r\n    tombs, and tablets; glad am I to be of even such small service to\r\n    my country, and hopeful that the slight revision to which I have\r\n    subjected the work will prove to have been as happily, as it has\r\n    been carefully, done. Permit, I beg, an author of exceeding merit to\r\n    come first of all into your hands, which are most fitted for every\r\n    excellence, and then to go forth brightly and cheerfully into the\r\n    hands of all other students. Farewell.\r\n\r\n    Paris, at the College of Plessis, 10 May, 1510.\r\n\r\n    CIVIS.\r\n\r\nAnd at the end of the book is this other letter, which gives us to know\r\nthat the volume is a collection of fragments of ancient authors.\r\n\r\n    _Geofroy Tory of Bourges to the Reader, greeting._[206]\r\n\r\n    When I began, I believe under favourable auspices, to print Valerius\r\n    Probus, it occurred to me, not wishing a book of one or two codices\r\n    to be unsuitable as a manual, to print, along with Probus, several\r\n    articles well worth making the acquaintance of. I have added to\r\n    Probus, Priscian's treatise 'De ponderibus et mensuris'; likewise\r\n    Columella's 'Quemadmodum datæ formæ agrorum metiri debeant'; also\r\n    Georgius Valla's 'Figuras quæ sub dimensionem cadant'; and, further,\r\n    some dialogues, together with some enigmas, carefully collected,\r\n    as occasion allowed, from various authors. The enigmas I have\r\n    designedly left unexplained, so that, when you come to read them\r\n    (as Gellius says in book xii, ch. 6), you may sharpen your wits by\r\n    trying to puzzle them out.[207] Give your attention to them, I beg,\r\n    good reader, so that I may not, as Plautus enigmatically observes in\r\n    the 'Miles,' throw dust in your eyes. Farewell.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the pieces which Tory here mentions, there are many others\r\nin this volume of miscellanies.[208] It contains also several pieces of\r\nverse by Tory himself. Here is one which will give an idea of his literary\r\ntastes:--\r\n\r\n    _Dialogue by Geofroy Tory, in which the City of Bourges is described\r\n    in the rôle of a speaking character._[209]\r\n\r\n    _Speakers_: MONITOR _and_ CITY.\r\n\r\n    MON. City, what is your name?\r\n\r\n    CITY. Bourges.\r\n\r\n    MON. Now, tell me, what mean those proud buildings that I\r\n    see?\r\n\r\n    CITY. Temples, houses, towers, divine palaces you see.\r\n\r\n    MON. Ah! they overtop the heavens with their piles. What\r\n    temple is that, I pray?\r\n\r\n    CITY. The Cathedral of St. Etienne, first of martyrs; it\r\n    overtops even the lofty marbles of the goddess Trivia.\r\n\r\n    MON. What is that single house which stands distinguished\r\n    for its red hearts? Was it built by the hand of Memnon?\r\n\r\n    CITY. This was built in an earlier time by the mortal\r\n    Jacques Cœur [Heart],[210] a man of wealth; him envy took from us.\r\n\r\n    MON. Say! what tower is that that is seen standing higher\r\n    than the lighthouse of Pharos? I am filled with wonder when I see it\r\n    fully.\r\n\r\n    CITY. When the mighty Ambigatus ruled the Celtic peoples,\r\n    in an earlier time, this great tower was built.\r\n\r\n    MON. Say, oh, say, that golden palace, is it the Capitol?\r\n    Answer; why do you not speak, Bourges? You who just now talked\r\n    with easy speech say nothing. Do you wish to become to me what\r\n    Harpocrates was of yore?\r\n\r\n    CITY. No, but, see you, this palace is to be approved for\r\n    its great art, because the world has not yet produced another like\r\n    it.\r\n\r\n    MON. What is this earth that yawns with such an opening?\r\n\r\n    CITY. It is the place where a tower was to be erected for\r\n    me.\r\n\r\n    MON. Have you not another as great as that?\r\n\r\n    CITY. I have. From two towers I get my name Bourges\r\n    [Biturix].\r\n\r\n    MON. By what name is it called in this time of ours?\r\n\r\n    CITY. The people name and call it 'the fosse of sands.'\r\n\r\n    MON. What river, what river have you to mention?\r\n\r\n    CITY. The Auron.\r\n\r\n    MON. Is it the one Cæsar mentions in describing the Gallic\r\n    Wars?\r\n\r\n    CITY. It is.\r\n\r\n    MON. Are there others?\r\n\r\n    CITY. There are two: they are the Voiselle and the Yèvre\r\n    herself, swarming with numberless fishes.\r\n\r\n    MON. What privileges have you?\r\n\r\n    CITY. The all-valuable privilege have I, and the hall, that\r\n    coin money.\r\n\r\n    MON. Is there nothing else?\r\n\r\n    CITY. Aquitaine calls me capital and receives her laws from\r\n    me.\r\n\r\n    MON. What divinities are with you?\r\n\r\n    CITY. There are Juno, Jupiter, and Pan, Vesta, Diana,\r\n    Ceres, Liber, and the Father himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n    QUINTILIANUS.\r\n\r\nSuch is the complete title of an edition of Quintilian's 'Institutes,'\r\nproduced by Tory, in 1510, at the request of Jean Rousselet, of Lyon.[211]\r\n\r\nThis is a large octavo volume, printed in italic (without pagination),\r\ncomposed of 46 quarto sheets (signatures A to ZZv): there are several\r\npassages in Greek type of excellent appearance, but without accents.\r\nUndertaken at the request of Jean Rousselet, and printed at his expense,\r\nthis book probably was not put on the market. In fact it bears no\r\nbookseller's nor any printer's name. We should not even know where it was\r\nprinted, were it not for the fact that the dedication, dated the third of\r\nthe Calends of March,[212] states that the manuscript was sent by Tory\r\nfrom Paris to Lyon. At the end of the volume we find these words only:\r\n'Impressum fuit hoc opus anno Domini M. CCCCCX, septimo calend.\r\nJulii.' This date corresponds to June 25, 1510.\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\n    LEONIS BAPTISTÆ ALBERTI FLORENTINI ... LIBRI DE RE ÆDIFICATORIA\r\n    DECEM. (Mark of B. Rembolt.) Venundantur Parrhisiis, in Sole\r\n    Aureo vici Sancti Jacobi, et in intersignio Trium Coronarum, e\r\n    regione Divi Benedicti.\r\n\r\nQuarto; 14 preliminary leaves and 174 of text (signatures A to Y). On the\r\nlast page is the mark of Louis Hornken, 'aux Trois Couronnes.' On the\r\nsecond preliminary leaf is printed the following dedication:--\r\n\r\n    _Geofroy Tory of Bourges to Philibert Babou and Jean Lallemand, the\r\n    younger, most illustrious men, heartiest greeting._[213]\r\n\r\n    Everybody knows, most estimable of men, that our forefathers,\r\n    contented with their own goodness, practised in the olden times a\r\n    kind of architecture that had in it little art and little elegance.\r\n    Satisfied with mediocrity, they built and inhabited houses and\r\n    dwellings of no great cost or splendour. Matters have finally\r\n    reached the point that now, men's intelligence having somewhat\r\n    awakened, new buildings are everywhere being erected which have\r\n    considerable celebrity. In fact, beginning with the time when\r\n    the magnanimous King Charles VIII, who was the terror of all\r\n    Italy, returned, victorious and crowned with glory, from Naples,\r\n    architecture, certainly a beautiful art, began, not only in its\r\n    Doric and Ionic forms, but also in its Italian form, to be practised\r\n    with great elegance throughout this country of France. At Amiens,\r\n    at Gaillon, at Tours, at Blois, at Paris, and in a hundred other\r\n    well-known places, one may now see striking buildings, public and\r\n    private, in the ancient style of architecture. One may now, I say,\r\n    see many buildings of such beauty and so nicely carved that the\r\n    French actually seem, and are generally considered, to surpass,\r\n    not only the Italians, but also the Dorians and the Ionians, who\r\n    were the teachers of the Italians. Notwithstanding the brilliancy\r\n    of these performances and these artists, I have thought it best\r\n    to offer gratefully, and carefully to add, a contribution of some\r\n    worth. Leo Baptista Albertus, a writer on architecture who is\r\n    trustworthy and familiar with his subject, was lying stored away in\r\n    my house as if in his last sleep. It seemed to me that he thoroughly\r\n    deserved to be printed in France just at this time, for the delight\r\n    and benefit of other famous artists who are better than he. It\r\n    seemed to me, I say, that he thoroughly deserved to be printed,\r\n    and for this reason especially, that the ten books, of which\r\n    the whole work consists, have been divided into chapters. These\r\n    chapters were accurately and carefully arranged by Robertus Duræus\r\n    Fortunatus,[214] a man of education and culture, who was the Head of\r\n    his College of Plessis at Paris four years ago when I taught there,\r\n    and they were generously given to me by him to be copied. I copied\r\n    them, and I furthermore polished up the whole work and cleared it of\r\n    all the errors possible; I wrote the gist of the text on the margin,\r\n    and gave the work to the printer to be printed. Permit, I pray, most\r\n    distinguished citizens of Bourges, that this excellent work come\r\n    auspiciously into the hands of all good artists and students, and\r\n    that it be handled and read under the protection of your names ever\r\n    to be cherished by me. Farewell, you who are the support and the\r\n    most distinguished glory of your country.[215]\r\n\r\n    Paris, near the College Coqueret, 18 August, 1512.\r\n\r\n    CIVIS.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the volume (penultimate page) we read:--\r\n\r\n'This most elegant and useful work on architecture of Leo Baptista\r\nAlbertus of Florence, a man of great distinction, was printed with great\r\naccuracy at Paris at the Golden Sun in the street of St. Jacques, at the\r\nexpense of Master Berthold Rembolt and Louis Hornken, who live in the same\r\nstreet, at the sign of the Three Crowns, near St. Benedict, A.D.\r\n1512, 23rd day of August.'\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\n    ITINERARIVM PROVINCIARUM OMNIUM ANTONINI AUGUSTI, CUM FRAGMENTO\r\n    EIUSDEM, NECNON INDICE HAUD QUAQUAM ASPERNANDO.--CUM PRIVILEGIO, NE\r\n    QUIS TEMERE HOC AB HINC DUOS ANNOS IMPRIMAT.--Venale habetur\r\n    ubi impressum est, in domo Henrici Stephani, e regione Scholæ\r\n    decretorum, Parrhisiis.\r\n\r\nSixteenmo (printed as 16s.); 120 leaves (signatures A to T), plus 8\r\npreliminary leaves. [1512.] Printed in black and red.\r\n\r\nThe volume begins with this dedicatory epistle:--\r\n\r\n    _Geofroy Tory of Bourges to Philibert Babou, most modest of men,\r\n    heartiest greeting._[216]\r\n\r\n    The 'Itinerarium,' most illustrious of men, which for many years\r\n    had lain in almost entire neglect, I first received four years ago\r\n    from a friend whom I must ever cherish, Christophe de Longueil,\r\n    who is beyond question a scholar of the highest standing in all\r\n    branches of polite learning. He gave it to me that I might make\r\n    a copy of it. It had occurred to me to send to you from Paris to\r\n    Tours a copy which, though written in my own hand, was not wholly\r\n    without elegance of form. I had given it to a man to bring to you\r\n    whose name I purposely spare, but he, regardless alike of both of\r\n    us and of his trust, quite shamelessly made a present of it to some\r\n    one else. Thus cheated of the fruit of my labour, I was preparing to\r\n    make for you another copy, when Longueil himself, who had formerly\r\n    brought the original from Picardy, and, as I have said, had given\r\n    it to me, having recently come to Paris from Poictiers, urged me\r\n    to have the work printed. This I have done, having arranged the\r\n    names of the towns separately and in order, and also added in the\r\n    proper places some matter taken from another manuscript. I have also\r\n    made an index, to facilitate the finding of the name of any town\r\n    or place in the whole work. Some perhaps will wonder at the style\r\n    of the work, and also occasionally in places at the Latinity. The\r\n    style, however, will receive sufficient approval from the student,\r\n    while the Latinity, in consideration of the early time in which the\r\n    work was written, will be condoned by the well-disposed reader. I\r\n    should have been disposed to make a number of emendations, using for\r\n    the purpose Ptolemy, Strabo, Dionysius, Mela, Pliny, Solinus, and\r\n    some others who are not at all to be despised, but out of regard\r\n    for the venerable author and in the desire to keep the manuscript,\r\n    which is very old, unchanged, I determined to make no alterations.\r\n    I am waiting for my friend Longueil to subject it some day to his\r\n    scrutinizing study, or for some Hermolaus to apply his exacting\r\n    file. One thing there is here which I shall not hesitate to touch:\r\n    the author's name in the manuscript was, in my judgement, wrong,\r\n    for it is written 'Antonius Augustus.' Hermolaus, a man of culture\r\n    withal, calls it in a number of places in his Corrections to Pliny,\r\n    'Antoninus.' Those who read will see for themselves. In the text\r\n    I have followed the manuscript itself; in the title of the book I\r\n    have followed Hermolaus. The fruit of my labour, such as it is, I\r\n    dedicate, as in duty bound, to you personally, in a spirit abounding\r\n    in gratitude. Accept it, I pray, with the favour with which you are\r\n    accustomed to accept all good things, and allow the studious to\r\n    pass, under your guidance, with this Itinerary in hand, through a\r\n    thousand famous cities. Farewell, most cultured patron of my studies.\r\n\r\n    Paris, near the College Coqueret, August 19, 1512.\r\n\r\n    CIVIS.\r\n\r\nThen comes a letter from the publisher to the reader:--\r\n\r\n    _Tory to the Reader, greeting._[217]\r\n\r\n    In order, gentle reader, that you may be able to use this\r\n    'Itinerarium' to better advantage, you must be advised that whatever\r\n    you find marked with a red virgule was larger in number in the old\r\n    manuscript than in the other which is more recent. Words which had\r\n    a different reading in the recent manuscript have small red letters\r\n    printed above in the proper places. Whenever the sign (˄) occurs\r\n    between words, a word or number should be marked above or at the\r\n    side by the same sign. The sign 'mpm.,' so written, also frequently\r\n    occurs in the text, and signifies 'milia plus minus.' It was written\r\n    thus so that the reader might not be wearied by the frequent\r\n    repetition of the long form. In the index you will sometimes find\r\n    the letter _b_ alone, either following or between the page-numbers:\r\n    this signifies that the word in question is found at least twice on\r\n    the same page. Pay attention, therefore, and kindly see to it that\r\n    in case you notice any who are displeased with my work, you may\r\n    say to yourself with reference to them that Persian saying: 'that\r\n    they may see virtue, and pine away leaving it behind.' I write this\r\n    because at the time of printing there were some who, understanding\r\n    nothing of this sort, condemned the matter according to their usual\r\n    practice. Farewell and live long in happiness.\r\n\r\n    CIVIS.\r\n\r\nNext to this comes a summary of the life of Antoninus, and, lastly, some\r\nverses by the Burgundian Gérard de Vercel, in laudation of Tory and\r\nagainst poor printers. Here are the verses:--\r\n\r\n    _Hendecasyllabic Poem of the Burgundian Gérard de Vercel, on poor\r\n    printers._[218]\r\n\r\n    Therefore hence, away therefore, profane hands of the inauspicious\r\n    throng of printers; your impure works be off; that by your forbidden\r\n    coming and impious front you may not stain and soil this heavenly\r\n    thing. Let no man fail to know: this volume is sacred.\r\n\r\n    Ah! vile and wretched printers, unskilled to put in print even the\r\n    trifles of the schools or old women's tales, why do you spoil arts\r\n    that are holy, and pollute with impure hand the laborious works of\r\n    the nine[219] sisters?\r\n\r\n    What do you not put forth from your office that is worthy to be cast\r\n    forth and buried where the refuse of the stomach is placed?\r\n\r\n    Therefore hence, away therefore, oh ye profane, ye vile and wretched\r\n    printers. Be this word enough: sacred is this volume, which our\r\n    Geofroy, our famous Geofroy, he, I say, of Bourges, taking pity\r\n    on Pius, unearthed from its Lethæan rust and sleep, employing the\r\n    guidance and assistance of his friend Longueil.[220]\r\n\r\nThe book is brought to a close by an 'avis au lecteur' thus conceived:\r\n\r\n    _Tory to the Reader, happiness._[221]\r\n\r\n    These few corrections, excellent reader, I beg you not to wonder at.\r\n    I have collected them, such as differ from the readings of the old\r\n    manuscript, so that you may be able readily to emend the book for\r\n    yourself. I should lay the burden of the errors on the printers, but\r\n    the art of printing has this natural peculiarity, that the smallest\r\n    book cannot be printed from beginning to end without some mistakes.\r\n    Farewell.\r\n\r\n    _Epigram to the Student by Tory._\r\n\r\n    If, reader, you are preparing to journey in a fixed course to a\r\n    hundred towns, to a hundred cities, if you desire to travel, better\r\n    instructed and on the direct road, to a hundred seaports with their\r\n    bays, then ever gratefully and carefully hold this little book in\r\n    your right hand ready to consult.[222]\r\n\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\n    GOTOFREDI TORINI BITURICI IN FILIAM CHARISSIMAM, VIRGUNCULARUM\r\n    ELEGANTISSIMAM, EPITAPHIA ET DIALOGI.--IN EANDEM ETIAM QUATOUR ET\r\n    VIGINTI DISTICHA UNUM ET EUNDEM SENSUM COPIA VERBORUM ET INGENII\r\n    FŒCUNDITATE PULCHRE REPETENTIA.\r\n\r\nThese verses of Tory on the death of his daughter Agnes form a small\r\nvolume of two quarto sheets (or eight leaves). The book is dedicated to\r\nPhilibert Babou; it was printed February 15, 1523, old style (1524), a few\r\ndays after Tory had conceived the idea of his 'Champ fleury' (January 6,\r\n1524). The printer, who is not named, was Simon de Colines, then living\r\nnear the School of Law ('e regione scholæ decretorum').\r\n\r\nOn the last page appears a mark engraved specially for this little book,\r\nfor it includes a tiny winged figure ascending heavenward, which doubtless\r\nrepresents the soul of Tory's daughter returning to God. This mark\r\nreappears at the end of the Hours of 1524-1525, but minus the small figure\r\njust mentioned.[223]\r\n\r\nAs we learn from the text, Agnes, who died August 25, 1522, at the age\r\nof nine years eleven months and thirty days, was born August 26, 1512.\r\nSo that Tory was married at least as early as 1511. We know from another\r\ndocument that his wife's name was Perrette le Hullin.\r\n\r\nThe only known copy of this little volume, the text of which I reproduce\r\nin extenso, belonged [in 1865] to M. Joachim Gomez de la Cortina, Marquis\r\nde Morante, who was so exceedingly kind as to send it from Madrid to\r\nParis, that I might examine it at my leisure. M. de la Cortina has\r\ndescribed it in the fifth volume of the catalogue of his library (Madrid,\r\n1859; octavo). My only previous knowledge of it was derived from that\r\ncatalogue, although it was bought of M. Techener not more than ten years\r\nago, for 80 reals (20 francs).\r\n\r\n    _Tory to his Book._[224]\r\n\r\n    Go, book, to the sacred sanctuaries of pious poets; you are light,\r\n    polished, radiant, and neat. Splendidly arrayed you are, and\r\n    have nard, and roses, and saffron; the Latin goddesses, gracious\r\n    divinities, together with Phœbus. Be not afraid lest you do\r\n    not carry with you the favour of the gods; they will lift you,\r\n    laurel-scented, above the stars.\r\n\r\n    _Agnes Tory, sweetest and most modest of maidens, addresses the\r\n    wayfarer from her tomb._\r\n\r\n    Thou who passest with light foot, beloved wayfarer, stay thy step a\r\n    little; lo, I wish to say a few words to thee. Live in remembrance\r\n    of death, free from vices, and, if thou art wise, cast aside that\r\n    hope of life which thou cherishest. Thou art radiant with beauty\r\n    to-day, but, when the thread is cut, impious Fate hurries thee\r\n    straight on to nought. I know this by experience, for, lately but\r\n    a young girl of ten, I was suddenly snatched away. Like a rose I\r\n    bloomed, sharer in those virtues which are usually seen in tender\r\n    maidenhood. But yet I died, overwhelmed by the cruel fates, and now\r\n    I am food for the flesh-eating worms. Food for the flesh-eating\r\n    worms I lie, but not so wholly lifeless that I cannot speak the\r\n    truth to thee. I speak in the Latin tongue, and this is not strange,\r\n    fair friend, for I am to be named the daughter of a pious poet.\r\n    Desiring to instruct me in the Ausonian tongue, and also to render\r\n    me accomplished in the polite arts, he, like a most affectionate\r\n    father, teaching me night and day, himself laid the foundations,\r\n    sweet and ample, for my life. I should be accomplished in the\r\n    learning of the famous Muses, and I should sing beautiful songs in\r\n    pleasing measure; and then my sire would have given me fond kisses,\r\n    placing the laurel-wreath upon my head. O pitiful lot of human\r\n    beings! O hopes doomed to perish! On earth there is nothing that\r\n    can be lasting. Not only does death show herself face to face to\r\n    wretched mortals, but with silent step she steals upon them secretly\r\n    and unbeknown. Ah! beware, therefore, beware, thou who art doomed\r\n    to die, the world will certainly in a moment's time fall and crash\r\n    about thee. Thou, while thou still livest, while thou seekest great\r\n    honours, art with infirm and rapid step steadily approaching thy\r\n    doom. If thou departest satisfied with this one certain warning, and\r\n    if thou believest that I speak the truth, bestrew me with flowers,\r\n    violets and lilies, and nard. Pray for me too, if it please thee,\r\n    and weep. Me thou wilt cause by thy prayers to mount to the lofty\r\n    vault of Heaven, where is perpetual light, peace, and grateful rest.\r\n    This was the little that I wished thee to know. Live in remembrance\r\n    of death, thou who art destined soon to die. Farewell.\r\n\r\n    She died where she was born, at Paris, 25 August, A.D. 1522.\r\n\r\n    She lived nine years, eleven months, about thirty days; the hours\r\n    are known to none; God alone knows the minutes.\r\n\r\n    FATHER _and_ DAUGHTER, _Speakers_.\r\n\r\n    F. Food for the worms you lie, dearest daughter. Me you\r\n    leave in perpetual tears and weeping.\r\n\r\n    D. Dear father, spare your weeping and tears. It is all\r\n    over with me. Death carries away both young and old.\r\n\r\n    F. Nor can I refrain from terrible wailing. Alas! I should\r\n    have more rightly died before you.\r\n\r\n    D. Such was not the will of the heavenly fates. At your\r\n    death, believe me, you shall most certainly come to me.\r\n\r\n    F. In the meantime, with bended head, I will bring with\r\n    full hands violets and lilies to your tomb.\r\n\r\n    D. Add your prayers; through prayers I shall fly to the\r\n    high vault of Heaven. Pious prayers enable us to ascend to the lofty\r\n    stars.\r\n\r\n    F. It is as you say; and do you too, my daughter, pray for\r\n    your father; pray that he may rise with you to the glad Heavens.\r\n\r\n    D. To the glad Heavens you shall rise, free from bitter\r\n    cares, and with all the trouble of your mind removed.\r\n\r\n    F. You speak the truth, and so I will do. The good God\r\n    calls you to himself in Heaven? Dear daughter, farewell.\r\n\r\n    F. Alas! my sweet soul, you are dead.\r\n\r\n    D. Courage, father, no one is immortal.\r\n\r\n    _Twelve distichs to be inscribed on the twelve different sides of an\r\n    urn._\r\n\r\n                         On the first side.\r\n\r\n    You wish flowers! violets! you wish lilies! garlands! cyperus!

See,\r\n    where the laurel grows upward to the lofty sky.\r\n\r\n                       On the eighth.\r\n\r\n    Here lies in death Agnes of memory dear; she could already sing\r\n    tripping measures with tender voice.\r\n\r\n                      On the ninth.\r\n\r\n    Here lies the maiden poet ten years of age, an honour to freeborn\r\n    song and maidenhood.\r\n\r\n                       On the tenth.\r\n\r\n    If you wish to know where Agnes' ashes really lie, they are here;\r\n    hesitate not in your belief, but be assured.\r\n\r\n                     On the eleventh.\r\n\r\n    Do you wish to hear Phœbus and the Muses' selves singing in sweet\r\n    strains?

The maiden Agnes, whose ashes this earthen urn beside\r\n    me holds.\r\n\r\n    MON. Whence comes this sweet odour to my nostrils?\r\n\r\n    MA. From the urn, an odour placed there by the Graces,\r\n    beings divine.\r\n\r\n    MON. What did they place there?\r\n\r\n    MA. Roses and cinnamon, balsam and nard, flowers and\r\n    violets, lilies, garlands, and saffron.\r\n\r\n    MON. Is there marjoram also in the urn, the cyperus with\r\n    oil of myrrh?\r\n\r\n    MA. There is in it every fragrant herb and pleasant odour.\r\n\r\n    MON. Does the urn, beautifully decked, wear a green crown?\r\n\r\n    MA. As is fitting and right, it wears a laurel-wreath.\r\n\r\n    MON. What is the reason?\r\n\r\n    MA. It contains the rejoicing Muses, who celebrate with\r\n    song the rites of the tender maiden.\r\n\r\n    MON. Do they sing alone?\r\n\r\n    MA. Alone? No. Phœbus Apollo in the centre tunes his lyre\r\n    and performs the mystic rites.\r\n\r\n    MON. What, then, do you mean, sweetest maid, by this great\r\n    moaning, and why do the divinities beside you sweetly sing?\r\n\r\n    MA. I will tell you the truth. I cannot but willingly weep;\r\n    so nobly gifted was she in intellect. But ten years of age, having\r\n    followed her father's precepts, she was even then a poet who could\r\n    sing in tripping measure.\r\n\r\n    MON. A mighty miracle of nature you recount to me.\r\n\r\n    MA. Nothing on this earth can be truer.\r\n\r\n    MON. Who are these whom I see standing here?\r\n\r\n    MA. Sport, Merriment, then Gesture, Honour, Virtue, and\r\n    festive Love.\r\n\r\n    MON. And these shattered arms that lie in great numbers\r\n    around the urn?\r\n\r\n    MA. The gods themselves carried them when they were whole.\r\n\r\n    MON. What will they do now that all these arms have been\r\n    thus broken?\r\n\r\n    MA. They will lament and weep and groan for all time.\r\n\r\n    MON. Shall you too weep?\r\n\r\n    MA. I shall weep in sorrow all my days.\r\n\r\n    MON. Have you a name?\r\n\r\n    MA.

He practises industriously every day the liberal arts.\r\n\r\n    MON. Does he also write melodies and poems?\r\n\r\n    A. He does. He also blesses with sweet words this lot of\r\n    mine.\r\n\r\n    MON. Yes, the skill of the man is wonderful.\r\n\r\n    A. Hardly has any land produced so famous a man.\r\n\r\n    MON. O maiden happy in such a father!\r\n\r\n    A. I certainly am so. He also exalts my name to the skies.\r\n\r\n    MON. I hear the symphony.\r\n\r\n    A. The Clarian Muses, together with Phœbus, sing their\r\n    melodies here with me night and day.\r\n\r\n    MON. Near you I see the Graces.\r\n\r\n    A. They tender garlands to me.\r\n\r\n    MON. Whence do they pluck violets?\r\n\r\n    A. On the Elysian Hills.\r\n\r\n    MON. Are there others with you?\r\n\r\n    A. There are also three divinities.\r\n\r\n    MON. What are they?\r\n\r\n    A. Sport, and Love, fair Monitor, and Merriment.\r\n\r\n    MON. What do they?\r\n\r\n    A. They lay in place for me holy holocausts, and they fill\r\n    the accustomed hearths with tinder and with fire.\r\n\r\n    MON. Have you long been a goddess of the upper regions?\r\n\r\n    A. I am becoming a goddess of the upper regions.\r\n\r\n    MON. If you are a goddess, why do you not have your dear\r\n    parents ascend to the heavenly realms?\r\n\r\n    A. They will both ascend.\r\n\r\n    MON. But when?\r\n\r\n    A. When their fates clearly see that it is necessary. Each\r\n    man has his fixed day, appointed for him by the fates.\r\n\r\n    MON. Each man, therefore, has his fixed and immovable day?\r\n\r\n    A. To every man comes death on a certain day.\r\n\r\n    MON. Meanwhile what will your father and mother do here on\r\n    earth?\r\n\r\n    A. What? They will perform their holy, sacred duties, and\r\n    pray.\r\n\r\n    MON. Afterwards what will happen?\r\n\r\n    A. In blessedness they will ascend to the heavenly realms,\r\n    when the Heavenly Father above so wills.\r\n\r\n    MON.

And did she, well-skilled, sing poetic measures?\r\n\r\n    G. She did.\r\n\r\n    W. 'Tis a wonder that you tell me of.\r\n\r\n    G. She wrote festive songs in sweet verse, spontaneously\r\n    playing, spontaneously singing.\r\n\r\n    W. O rare grace of nature!

'Twas a song, whatever she by chance wished to utter;\r\n    whatever she desired to say, 'twas a song.\r\n\r\n    W. Whence came to her the source of such a power?\r\n\r\n    G. From the realms above, whence it is used to come.\r\n\r\n    W. As one divine, therefore, she wrote charming verses?\r\n\r\n    G. As one divine, following her own and her father's\r\n    precepts.\r\n\r\n    W. Does her father too compose melodies?\r\n\r\n    G. He does, he is a poet fair and proper. He is proper and\r\n    deft and neat, bright and decent. He is one whom the Muse blesses\r\n    with divine song.\r\n\r\n    W. He is certainly well-deserving of some Mæcenas.\r\n\r\n    G. Few are the Mæcenases that live in the French world. No\r\n    one to-day either encourages the liberal arts by appropriate gifts\r\n    or undertakes to encourage them in any way. Uprightness and fair\r\n    virtue are in no esteem. So powerful is the sway of unhappy Avarice.\r\n    Treachery, deceit, and vice are in the ascendant. Virtues are put in\r\n    the background, and every form of wretched evil creeps abroad.\r\n\r\n    W. What, therefore, does he who is trained by the charming\r\n    Muses?\r\n\r\n    G. He takes pleasure in being able to live in his own house.\r\n\r\n    W. He ought to go with hurried step to the courts of kings.\r\n\r\n    G. He does not care to, because he has a free heart. Your\r\n    potentates sometimes take pleasure in looking at songs, but what\r\n    then? They requite them with nods. Golden songs, drawn from the high\r\n    heavens, they should reward with jewels and with pure gold. But,\r\n    frivolous as they are, they foolishly give their grand gifts to\r\n    fools, spendthrifts, and rogues.\r\n\r\n    W. Did he educate his own daughter in studies befitting her\r\n    birth?\r\n\r\n    G. He did, and in the fine arts besides.\r\n\r\n    W. And was she earnest to retain her father's precepts?\r\n\r\n    G. She had no greater wish than to follow her father's\r\n    words.\r\n\r\n    W. Oh, what a great honour she would have been to her\r\n    country and her father, had she lived to undertake the duties of\r\n    life.\r\n\r\n    G. Yes, her glory would have excelled that of all other\r\n    girls in French lands. She was distinguished in appearance, her face\r\n    was beautiful in its modesty, and she was all compact of golden\r\n    words and ways. She drew to herself the hearts of men, young and\r\n    old, and made them follow her wishes with constant loyalty.\r\n\r\n    W. This is a miracle you tell me of.\r\n\r\n    G. I tell you the truth, wayfarer. She was a mirror of\r\n    true-born nobility.\r\n\r\n    W. Oh, overwhelming grief! Oh, bitter grief and pain! That\r\n    such a one could die so suddenly! What will her father do in the\r\n    meantime?\r\n\r\n    G. Bowed down with grief, he will suffer pain of heart and\r\n    shed unceasing tears.\r\n\r\n    W. He would do better to pour forth a flood of prayers to\r\n    the heavenly gods and to join to his prayers the last rites to the\r\n    dead.\r\n\r\n    G. He joins the last rites to his prayers and never ceases.\r\n    He fills the customary hearths with tinder and fire.\r\n\r\n    W. O maiden worthy of so deserving a father! O father, too,\r\n    blessed in such a daughter!\r\n\r\n    G. She now shines benign in the glad clouds, like a\r\n    radiance newly-risen, like a golden constellation.\r\n\r\n    W. May she triumph, shining in the ethereal realms, and may\r\n    the daughter graciously take her father with her.\r\n\r\n    G. Go about your affairs, if you will depart, wayfarer.\r\n    This is what I wished to say. Friend, farewell.\r\n\r\n    W. Live in happiness, guardian of the tomb and revealer of\r\n    the urn. I go about my affairs diligently and in haste.\r\n\r\n    Printed at Paris, near the Law School, A.D. 1523, 15th day\r\n    of Feb'y.\r\n\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\n    CHAMP FLEVRY AU QUEL EST CONTENU LART & SCIENCE DE LA DEUE &\r\n    VRAYE PROPORTIÕ DES LETTRES ATTIQUES, QUŌ DIT AUTREMĒT LETTRES\r\n    ANTIQUES, & VULGAIREMENT LETTRES ROMAINES PROPORTIONNEES SELON LE\r\n    CORPS & VISAGE HUMAIN.--Ce Liure est Priuilegie pour Dix Ans\r\n    Par Le Roy nostre Sire, & est a vendre a Paris sus Petit Pont\r\n    a Lenseigne du Pot Casse, par maistre Geofroy Tory de Bourges\r\n    Libraire, & Autheur du dict Liure.

I could readily do the same\r\nwith this little book; but, considering that, if I should give it to one\r\nrather than to another, there might arise envy and detraction, I have\r\nthought that it would be well and wisely done of me to make of it a gift\r\nto ye all, O ye devout lovers of goodly letters! nor to prefer the great\r\nto the humble, save in so far as he loves letters the more and is the more\r\nat home in virtue.'\r\n\r\nThen comes a table, filling eight pages, and another letter of Tory, from\r\nwhich we make a few extracts.\r\n\r\n    _To the readers of this book, humble greeting._\r\n\r\n    It is commonly said, and truly said, that there is great natural\r\n    virtue in plants, in stones, and in words. To offer examples would\r\n    be superfluous, so certainly is it true. But I would that God\r\n    might be pleased to give me grace so to prevail by my words and\r\n    entreaties that I may persuade some persons that, if they will not\r\n    do homage to our French tongue, they will at the least cease to\r\n    corrupt it. I find that there be three sorts of men who strive and\r\n    exert themselves to corrupt and debase it: they are the 'skimmers\r\n    of Latin,' the 'jesters,' and the 'jargoners.' When the skimmers\r\n    of Latin say: 'Despumon la verbocination latiale, & transfreton la\r\n    Sequane au dilucule & crepuscule, puis deãbulon par les Quadrivies\r\n    & Platees de Lutece, & comme verisimiles amorabundes captiuon la\r\n    beniuolence de lomnigene & omniforme sexe feminin,'[226] it seems\r\n    to me that they make sport not of their fellows alone, but of\r\n    themselves. When the jesters, whom I may fairly call 'slashers\r\n    [dechiqueteurs] of language,' say: 'Monsieur du Page, si vous ne me\r\n    baillez vne lesche du iour, ie me rue a Dieu, & vous dis du cas, vo⁹\r\n    aures nasarde sanguine,' they seem to me to do as great harm to our\r\n    language as they do to their coats, by slashing and destroying with\r\n    contumely that which is of more worth whole than when maliciously\r\n    torn and defaced. And in like manner when jargoners[227] make their\r\n    remarks in their malicious and wicked jargon, it seems to me not\r\n    only that they prove themselves dedicate to the gibbet, but that it\r\n    would be well if they had never been born. Although Master François\r\n    Villon was in his day mightily ingenious therein, yet would he have\r\n    done better to have essayed to do some other more goodly thing....\r\n    I consider moreover that there is another sort of men who corrupt\r\n    our language even more: they are the innovators and forgers of\r\n    new words. If such forgers are not villains, I deem them little\r\n    better. Think you that they show great refinement when they say\r\n    after drinking that they have 'le Cerueau tout encornimatibule &\r\n    emburelicoque dũg tas de mirilifiques & triquedondaines, dung tas\r\n    de gringuenauldes & guylleroches qui les fatrouillēt incessammēt?'\r\n    I would not quote such foolish words, were it not that my scorn\r\n    in thinking of them forces me to do it. 'Si natura negat, facit\r\n    indignatio versum....'\r\n\r\n    Yours in everything,\r\n    Geofroy Tory de Bourges.\r\n\r\nAfter this letter comes the text of the book, which occupies, as I have\r\nsaid, eighty numbered leaves.[228]\r\n\r\nAt the end we read: 'Here endeth this present book ... the printing of\r\nwhich was finished Wednesday the twenty-eighth day of the month of April,\r\nin the year 1529, for Maistre Geofroy Tory of Bourges, author of the\r\nsaid book, and bookseller, living in Paris, who has it for sale on the\r\nPetit Pont, at the sign of the Pot Casse, and for Giles Gourmont, also\r\na bookseller, living in said Paris, who likewise has it for sale on Rue\r\nSainct Jaques, at the sign of the Trois Couronnes.'[229]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis work was reprinted in 1549, in octavo,[230] with the same woodcuts,\r\nbut with some variations in other respects.\r\n\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\n    LA TABLE DE LANCIEN PHILOSOPHE CEBES, NATIF DE THEBES, ET\r\n    AUDITEUR DARISTOTE.

In the first volume, 10\r\npreliminary leaves and signatures A to T; in the second volume, signatures\r\n_a_ to _vij_. All the pages are embellished with narrow filleted borders,\r\non some of which the Lorraine cross appears.\r\n\r\nOn the first page is Tory's Pot Cassé (no. 6), or Jean Petit's mark,\r\naccording as the copies were issued by one or the other of those\r\npublishers, who divided the edition.\r\n\r\nOn the second leaf is an extract from the license (dated September 18,\r\n1529[231]), in so far as it concerns this book, 'the printing of which was\r\nfinished the fifth day of October, in the year above named.'\r\n\r\nOn the third leaf is the dedicatory epistle, the essential part of which\r\nis as follows:--\r\n\r\n    _Geofroy Tory of Bourges doth say and give humble greetings to all\r\n    studious and true lovers of excellent pastime in reading._\r\n\r\n    Horace, a poet of old surnamed Flaccus, hath told us in writing\r\n    in his 'Ars Poetica' that philosophers and poets are wont, under\r\n    the outer bark of deceitful words, to convey a moral meaning which\r\n    may profit us in the knowledge of virtue or give us pleasure in\r\n    the charm of their style and their pleasing invention. Wherefore,\r\n    seeing this to be true, and reading all day the Table of the ancient\r\n    philosopher Cebes, likewise the Dialogues of the very learned and\r\n    graceful Greek author Lucian, methought that it would be well done\r\n    of me to translate them into our French tongue also, and cause them\r\n    to be printed, to the end that each one of you, upon reading the\r\n    said Table, may readily recognize what pure virtue is, and may find\r\n    honest pleasure in the ingenious and moral Dialogues of the said\r\n    Lucian. I offer them with a most humble and devout heart to you,\r\n    O scholars and lovers of pure worth! giving you to know that, in\r\n    so far as it hath been possible for me so to do, I have followed\r\n    the true text, adding nothing of my own thereto, neither using nor\r\n    misusing any modification or stuffing whatsoever. I have most gladly\r\n    written them down for you in flowing language, in your domestic\r\n    mother tongue, without attempting to mix therein refinements of\r\n    phrase, strange words, or such language as Carmentes, mother of\r\n    Evander, might be unable to understand or decipher. I see some who,\r\n    if they should write but six words, four will be either out of use,\r\n    or manufactured, or stretched out longer than a spear. Like him who\r\n    said in the laments and epitaphs of a king of the Basoche:--\r\n\r\n    'Au point prefix que spondile et muscule,\r\n    Sens vernacule, cartilaige auricule,\r\n    DIsis acule, Diana crepuscule,\r\n    Et lheure acculle pour son lustre assoupir.'\r\n\r\n    And a thousand other like sayings which I leave to him. I know not\r\n    to whom such language gives pleasure; but to me it seems scarce fair\r\n    or fine. It would seem, and yet I misdoubt, as if such a battery of\r\n    behorned and overrefined words had come or been hurled down from the\r\n    Latin language to ours; for there have been, and there are to this\r\n    day many who think that they have done a wondrous thing if they have\r\n    written in Latin a strange and unduly long word, like him who said,\r\n    and ingeniously none the less: 'Conturbabuntur Constantinopolitani\r\n    innumerabilibus sollicitudinibus.' And that other, Hermes by name,\r\n    who took such delight in writing long and refined words that he\r\n    was hoist with his own petard when another ingenious man composed\r\n    against him, in manufactured words, with an armful of syllables, the\r\n    distich which follows:--\r\n\r\n    'Gaudet honorificabilitudinitatibus Hermes,\r\n      Consuetudinibus, sollicitudinibus.'\r\n\r\n    I say this in passing, that you may not expect to find unwonted\r\n    words in this your little book. I know that there was once a wise\r\n    man and philosopher who said one day to his friend: 'Loquere verbis\r\n    presentibus et utere moribus antiquis,' which is to say, 'Speak in\r\n    ordinary language and live according to the manners of the good\r\n    old days.' In this your said little book you will, I think, find\r\n    charm, for it is full of many goodly and ingenious conceits both of\r\n    Cebes and of Lucian. I have placed first herein, as I have said, the\r\n    Table of this man Cebes, to the end that you may see at the outset\r\n    that 'poesis est pictura loquens': a poetical work is a speaking\r\n    picture. Touching the Dialogues of the learned Lucian, I have not\r\n    included them all, nor translated all; but I have chosen thirty only\r\n    of those which in my opinion are the finest and most moral, which\r\n    you may readily discover to be not only pleasant to read, but most\r\n    profitable in goodly moral teaching. You will accept them then, if\r\n    it please you, with kindly face and heart, remembering that with\r\n    God's help I will shortly make you some other new gift, to the best\r\n    of my ability. And meanwhile I will pray to our Lord Jesus to have\r\n    you in his keeping according to your wishes.\r\n\r\n    From Paris; in all things your devoted servant,\r\n    Geofroy Tory.\r\n\r\nFollows a long list of errata, and a table of the Dialogues, followed\r\nby another letter, 'aux lecteurs des Dialogues de Lucian contenuz en ce\r\npresent livre.' This letter contains nothing personal to Tory, and I will\r\nquote only the closing passage, where, speaking of the Dialogues, he\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n    I believe that, if the ancient and noble painter Zeuxis of\r\n    Heracleia, if Raphael of Urbino, Michel Angelo, Leonardo da Vinci,\r\n    or Albrecht Dürer should try to paint philosophers and their various\r\n    aspects, they could not paint them so well nor so to the life as\r\n    our Lucian paints them herein. It will seem to you that you do\r\n    verily see them and hear them speak, and that Menippus, before your\r\n    wondering eyes, doth fly up to heaven to learn the truth concerning\r\n    all the falsehoods of the said philosophers. May God have you in his\r\n    keeping according to your noble and goodly desire.\r\n\r\n    From the University of Paris; in all things your devoted servant,\r\n    Geofroy Tory.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the book, after the Dialogues, Tory introduced a number of\r\nmoral apothegms and plays upon words, probably of his own invention.\r\n\r\nThis volume is printed with the type and decorative letters of 'Champ\r\nfleury.'\r\n\r\n\r\n12\r\n\r\n    SUMMAIRE DE CHRONIQUES, CONTENANS LES VIES, GESTES ET CAS\r\n    FORTUITZ DE TOUS LES EMPEREURS DEUROPE, DEPUIS IULES CESAR IUSQUES\r\n    A MAXIMILIEN, DERNIER DECEDE.--Avec maintes belles histoires\r\n    et mensions de plusieurs roys, ducs, contes, princes, capitaines et\r\n    aultres, tant chrestiens que non, tant de hault que de has estat et\r\n    condition.--Faict premierement en langue latine par venerable et\r\n    discrete personne Iehan Baptiste Egnace, Venicien.--Et translate de\r\n    ladicte langue latine en langaige francoys par maistre Geofroy Tory\r\n    de Bourges.--On les vend a Paris, a lenseigne du Pot Casse.--Avec\r\n    privilege du Roy nostre sire pour X ans.'\r\n\r\nOctavo; 16 preliminary leaves (signatures _a_ and _b_), 99 leaves of text,\r\nnumbered, and 13 leaves of index and errata, not numbered (signatures A to\r\nO); in all, 128 leaves, or 16 octavo sheets. All the pages are enclosed\r\nin threefold fillets, with compartments running into one another, such as\r\nwere still used in printing-offices until quite recently. I will remark in\r\npassing that the sheets of this book bear only two signature letters each,\r\none on the first page (for the first form), the other on the third page\r\n(for the second form), as is the general practice to-day, instead of the\r\nfour which were commonly inserted, to no useful end.\r\n\r\nOn the verso of the first leaf, the recto of which is occupied by the\r\ntitle, is printed the king's license, in these terms:--\r\n\r\n    Francoys, by the grace of God King of France, to the Provost of\r\n    Paris, Bailly of Rouen, Seneschal of Lion, and to all other our\r\n    justiciars and officials, or to their lieutenants, greeting. Our\r\n    dear and well-beloved maistre Geofroy Tory of Bourges, bookseller,\r\n    dwelling in our city of Paris, hath caused it to be said and shown\r\n    to us that he hath of late translated from the Latin into vernacular\r\n    French two books, one having been formerly translated from the\r\n    Greek into the Latin by several learned and commendable authors,\r\n    entitled: 'La Table du philosophe ancien Cebes, natif de Thebes,\r\n    et auditeur Daristote,' together with certain moral Dialogues of\r\n    Lucian; the other originally composed in the Latin tongue by Jehan\r\n    Baptiste Egnace, entitled: 'Summaire de Chroniques, contenant les\r\n    gestes et faictz de tous les empereurs Deurope, depuis Iules Cesar\r\n    jusques a Maximilian'; likewise another book, entitled: 'Les Reigles\r\n    generales de Lorthographe du langaige francoys'; the which books he\r\n    is desirous to print, were it our pleasure to permit him so to do,\r\n    and at the same time to forbid all booksellers, printers, and all\r\n    other persons whatsoever to print, cause to be printed, or expose\r\n    for sale the said books--Wherefore is it that we, having regard to\r\n    the trouble and labour which the said Tory hath had herein, have\r\n    given unto him license and permission to print, cause to be printed,\r\n    and expose for sale at a fair and reasonable price, by himself, his\r\n    servants, agents and factors, the said books above described, during\r\n    ten years following and subsequent to the printing thereof. Such is\r\n    our will, etc. Given at Paris the xxviii day of September, in the\r\n    year of grace M. D. XXIX, and of our reign the XV.\r\n\r\n    Heruoet.\r\n\r\nNext comes the following letter of Tory, by way of preface:--\r\n\r\n    _Geofroy Tory of Bourges, to all studious and true lovers of goodly\r\n    reading and profitable pastime, doth humbly bid and offer greeting._\r\n\r\n    I promised you not long since, in the preface to the Table of Cebes\r\n    and the thirty new Dialogues of Lucian, that I would ere long, by\r\n    my humble efforts, make for you another new book, which, to my\r\n    thinking, might afford you pleasing and useful pastime, by enticing\r\n    you to read and see therein things wherewith your mind might well in\r\n    due time and place be entertained and deliciously soothed. At this\r\n    present time (my most honourable lords), as your humble servant,\r\n    who is entirely devoted to you, I present to you a 'Summaire de\r\n    Chroniques,' the which I have translated for you, as I translated\r\n    the said Cebes and Dialogues, from the Latin into French, to the\r\n    best of my poor ability, forewarning you that, after the manner\r\n    of Jehan Baptiste Egnatius, the present author, I have neither\r\n    modified nor changed the meaning of the story in favour of any man\r\n    whatsoever. Nor is my translation made word for word, because that\r\n    would have been a too barren style and devoid of charm. I know\r\n    that, according to Horace ('nec verbo verbum curabit reddere fidus\r\n    interpres'), a translator should not vex his wits about rendering\r\n    each word that he translates into a word of his language; but should\r\n    retain the meaning and set it forth in the best style that shall\r\n    be possible for him. So I have done the best that I could, as well\r\n    for the love and respect that I owe you, as not to depart from the\r\n    pure truth of history, which is of such nature that it will not\r\n    brook to be in any way turned aside from its purity. Marcus Tullius\r\n    Cicero doth well enjoin it upon us, when he writes in the second\r\n    book of his 'Orator': 'Nam quis nescit primam esse historiæ legem,\r\n    ne quid falsi dicere audeat, deinde ne quid veri non audeat, ne\r\n    qua suspitio gratiæ sit in scribendo, ne qua simulatis?' 'But who\r\n    is there [he says] who does not know that the first law of history\r\n    is to dare to tell nothing that is untrue, and to tell the truth\r\n    without feigning, to the end that there may be no suspicion of\r\n    partiality or of envy in that which one writes?' Of a surety history\r\n    should be entirely true, not only for the reasons already given, but\r\n    because, as Cicero says a little before the place already quoted:\r\n    'Historia est testis temporum, lux veritatis, vita memoriæ, magistra\r\n    vitas, et nuncia vetustatis.' 'History [he says] is the testimony\r\n    of the times, the torch of truth, the nurse and life of the memory,\r\n    teacher and schoolmistress of our life, and messenger of antiquity.'\r\n    I have chosen to make you a present of a history, and a history\r\n    abridged to the limits of a summary, rather than of something else,\r\n    for the reason that while engaging yourselves, you may see therein,\r\n    as in a mirror, a thousand excellent things, wherefrom you shall\r\n    be able to hear and recognize innumerable useful suggestions which\r\n    shall do you good service on occasion in due time and place. Titus\r\n    Livius says, in the preface to the first book of his first Decade:\r\n    'Hoc illud est precipue in cognitione rerum salubre ac frugiferum,\r\n    omnis te exempli documenta in illustri posita monumento intueri,\r\n    unde tibi tuasque Reipublicæ quod imitare cupias, unde fœdum\r\n    inceptum, fœdum exitu quod vites.' 'It is [he says] peculiarly\r\n    good and useful in the knowledge of things, to see and learn in\r\n    noble history the teachings of worthy example, by the imitation and\r\n    likeness whereof you may choose for yourselves and for your country\r\n    that which you ought to imitate and follow, and that which you ought\r\n    to avoid as an abomination, at the beginning as well as at the end.'\r\n    Take therefore in good part, an it please you, this little work, and\r\n    accept it with a gracious face and expression, as of your kindliness\r\n    you are wont to do; even so you will invite me, of your courteous\r\n    and singular grace, henceforward to do better, with the aid of Our\r\n    Lord Iesus, to whom I pray that he will give to you all his love and\r\n    blessed grace, at your noble and worthy desire.\r\n\r\n    At Paris, this X day of April, M. D. XXIX.\r\n\r\nOn the last leaf of the book we find the Pot Cassé, with these words\r\nbeneath: 'The printing of this present book was finished at Paris, the\r\nXIII day of April, M. D. XXIX,[232] for maistre Geofroy\r\nTory de Bourges, who sells it in said Paris, at the sign of the Pot Casse.'\r\n\r\nThe only copy that I have seen of this edition was then owned by\r\n\r\nM. Ambroise Didot, who courteously permitted me to examine it at my\r\nleisure. It was in its original binding with the Pot Cassé. The book is\r\nprinted in the 'Champ fleury' type.\r\n\r\nThere are several other editions. I am familiar with two of them,\r\npublished by Charles L'Angelier, both in octavo, in 1543 and 1544. M.\r\nHippolyte Boyer mentions one of 1541, in his 'Histoire des Imprimeurs et\r\nLibraries de Bourges' (octavo, Bourges, 1854), page 27; but I have not\r\nseen it: whereas I have had the privilege of examining the other two.\r\nEach of them contains 112 leaves (signatures A to O), plus 4 unnumbered\r\nones. The book is illustrated with engravings of two kinds, in addition\r\nto the bookseller's mark on the title-page: the first, reproduced several\r\ntimes, represents an emperor, mounted, holding a battle-axe; it is not\r\nsigned, but is engraved with much delicacy, and embellished with the\r\nlittle cartouches so much affected by Tory. The others represent busts of\r\nemperors roughly engraved, which cannot be the work of that artist.\r\n\r\n\r\n13\r\n\r\n    LA PROCESSION DE SOISSONS DEVOTE ET MEMORABLE FAICTE A LA\r\n    LOUANGE DE DIEU, POUR LA DELIVRANCE DE NOSSEIGNEURS LES ENFANS\r\n    DE FRANCE.--On les vend a Paris, a lenseigne du Pot Casse,\r\n    rue Sainct Iaques, devant lescu[233] de Basle, et en la halle de\r\n    Beausse, a la mesme enseigne du Pot Casse, devant leglise de la\r\n    glorieuse Madalaine, avec privilege pour deux ans.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the book: 'The printing of this present book was finished\r\nthe XXIX day of August M.

Beneath Tory's\r\nmark are four Latin verses, probably of his composition, as are the six\r\nwhich bring the narrative to a close and which are entitled: 'Torinus\r\nBiturigicus ad Galliam.' On the verso of the title is the preface, dated\r\nAugust 25, 1530, and beginning thus: 'Geofroy Tory of Bourges to the\r\ndevoted lovers of good reading doth bid and offer humble greeting.'\r\n\r\nAt the top of leaf Aij we read: 'The order of the grand procession\r\nordained at Soissons by the reverend father in God Monseigneur Iehan\r\nOlivier, Abbé de Saint Mard at said Soissons, Councillor to the King our\r\nSire, and Chronicler of France, on Sunday the last day of July in the year\r\nof grace one thousand five hundred and thirty, to give thanks to our Lord\r\nfor the deliverance of our lords the Children of France.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese particulars are taken from the fifth edition of Brunet's 'Manual de\r\nLibraire.'

The title is set in an exceedingly\r\ngraceful border, borrowed from the Hours in octavo of 1527. The verso of\r\nthe title is blank, and on the second leaf is the following preface:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_Geofroy Tory of Bourges to the fair reader, greeting._[235]\r\n\r\nThere are certain eminent painters in this prolific age, most gentle\r\nreader, who, by their drawings, paintings, and varied colouring, depict\r\nthe tribal gods and human beings, as also other things of different sorts,\r\nwith such exactness that a voice and a soul seem the only things wanting\r\nto them; but here, most gentle reader, I offer you, nearly in the manner\r\nof these painters, a house, which not only is elegant and finished in\r\nits outlines and parts, but speaks prettily and describes itself part by\r\npart in a eulogy. I also offer you seven epitaphs, composed and written\r\nin the ancient style and in very ancient language. These epitaphs show,\r\nin a way that we may call comprehensible, the various affections to which\r\nunhappy mortals who are in love are subject. I am, I say, pleased to offer\r\nyou these, not that you may speak or write in obsolete words such as you\r\nhere find, but that you may have before your eyes, so bright and full of\r\ncharm, a sample of antiquity, and may know that you have been thoroughly\r\nwarned by me to be on your guard against falling into the snares and\r\nperplexities of an insane love. Farewell.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn addition to the border of the title-page, the book contains seven\r\nexquisite little engravings, corresponding to Tory's seven 'love\r\nepitaphs,'--engravings which are certainly his, in design at least,\r\nalthough unsigned. Here is a list of them:--\r\n\r\n1. Two hearts pierced by an arrow.\r\n\r\n2. Two hearts in a circle.\r\n\r\n3. Two hearts bound together by cords.\r\n\r\n4. Two hearts in a boat.\r\n\r\n5. A pig sniffing at two hearts.\r\n\r\n6. Two hearts, a distaff, etc.\r\n\r\n7. Two hearts being kicked by a horse.\r\n\r\nAs for the text of the book, it has been variously judged. Catherinot was\r\ndelighted with it; but the author of the 'Menagiana' reproves Tory for\r\nmanufacturing Latin words after the style of the author of the 'Songe du\r\nPoliphile' (see supra, page 55, note 2). We have seen that Tory himself\r\ndid not recommend such words to the reader.\r\n\r\nThe Bibliothèque Nationale has a copy of this little book, still in its\r\noriginal binding, with the Pot Cassé.\r\n\r\n\r\n15\r\n\r\n    SCIENCE POUR SENRICHIR HONNESTEMENT ET FACILEMENT, INTITULEE:\r\n    LECONOMIC XENOPHON, NAGUERES TRANSLATEE DE GREC ET LATIN EN LANGAIGE\r\n    FRANCOYS PAR MAISTRE GEOFROY TORY DE BOURGES.

As in the 'Sommaire de\r\nChroniques' of Egnasius, there are only two signature marks to the sheet\r\n(one for the first form and one for the second), and each page is enclosed\r\nin a three-line fillet. The title-page alone is set in a border of\r\narabesques of pleasing design.\r\n\r\nOn the verso of the title: 'At the aforesaid sign of the Pot Casse there\r\nbe also for sale Thucydides and Diodorus, with several other excellent\r\nbooks translated from Greek and Latin into French. Likewise there be\r\nbeautiful Hours and Offices of Our Lady, large, medium, and small,\r\nillustrated and vignetted in ancient and modern fashion.'\r\n\r\nOn the second leaf is an explanation of the words 'Economic' and\r\n'Xenophon'; and on the third a dedication, extracts from which follow.\r\n\r\n    _Geofroy Tory of Bourges to his most reverend father in God, Antoine\r\n    du Prat, Cardinal de Sens, legate in ordinary and Chancellor of\r\n    France, doth say and proffer most humble greeting._\r\n\r\n    After the book treating of the meaning of the ancient letters,\r\n    called 'Champ fleury,' the which I composed in the French tongue,\r\n    and the 'Table of Cebes,' with thirty moral dialogues, likewise\r\n    the 'Sommaire de Chroniques,' the which I translated into our said\r\n    tongue,[236] to confer a benefit on the studiously inclined, most\r\n    reverend father in God, it hath seemed to me a worthy occupation, if\r\n    I should employ myself in translating also the 'Economic Xenophon';\r\n    and beneath the shadow of your most honourable wing, first\r\n    presenting the same with humble devotion unto you, I have published\r\n    the same and placed it in the hands of all virtuous and worthy\r\n    persons, to pass the time studiously therewith and therein to find\r\n    good counsel for directing their families worthily and increasing\r\n    their wealth by honest means.\r\n\r\n    Wherefore, most reverend father in God, under your venerable favour\r\n    and blessing, the studious and veritable lovers of goodly reading\r\n    and fruitful occupation will kindly take this little book in their\r\n    condescending hands, and all will bear you good will, not for the\r\n    book alone, but for that you are he to whom all owe honour and\r\n    service, as to whom all the public welfare and all Christendom are\r\n    deeply indebted.\r\n\r\n    I shall continue to be, if it so please you, in your good favour,\r\n    and I will pray to Our Lord that he will give you his love according\r\n    to your noble and estimable desire.\r\n\r\n    From Paris this Wednesday, the fifth day of July, M. D.\r\n    XXXI.\r\n\r\nFollowing this document, which fills three leaves, comes an epistle from\r\nGeofroy Tory of Bourges to 'studious and worthy readers,' by way of\r\npreface. It fills two leaves. The eighth leaf is entirely blank. On the\r\nninth, the 'Economic Xenophon' begins, and extends from _b_ to _i_ 4; the\r\nfifth and sixth leaves of _i_ contain an 'Epistle from Seigneur Elisee\r\nCalense, native of Amphrates, which he sent to Rufinius, guardian of the\r\nEmperor Arcadius, replying to him touching the matter of managing his\r\nfamily and of keeping in order his domestic goods and chattels, translated\r\nfrom Latin into French by maistre Geofroy Tory de Bourges.'\r\n\r\nOn the last leaf but one appears a 'duplicate of the license granted to\r\nmaistre Geofroy Tory de Bourges, by the King our Sire, for this present\r\nbook and others named in this said license,' in these words:--\r\n\r\n    Francoys, by the grace of God King of France, to the Provost of\r\n    Paris, Bailly of Rouen, Seneschal of Lyon, and to all other our\r\n    justiciars and officials or their deputies, greeting. Our dear\r\n    well-beloved maistre Geofroy Tory of Bourges, bookseller, dwelling\r\n    in our city of Paris, hath caused it to be made known to us that\r\n    he hath of late made and composed in the Latin tongue a certain\r\n    book entitled; 'Ædiloquium et Erotica'[237]; likewise, that he\r\n    hath translated from Greek and Latin into French the 'Economic\r\n    Xenophon'; which books he would fain print, or cause to be\r\n    printed, if it should be our pleasure to permit him so to do, at\r\n    the same time causing all tradesmen, booksellers, printers, and\r\n    other persons whomsoever, to be forbidden to print or to expose\r\n    for sale in any manner the said books; and that, if any should be\r\n    brought hither by foreigners, other than those of the said Tory's\r\n    printing, they may not be sold within our realm during the period\r\n    of the four years reckoned from the date of the printing of said\r\n    books, with an extension for a like period for certain other books,\r\n    illustrations, and vignettes to be printed in the 'Heures et Office\r\n    de Nostre Dame' mentioned in two licenses heretofore granted to\r\n    him by our favour.[238] Wherefore, having regard and consideration\r\n    for the time and toil which it hath cost the said Tory to compile\r\n    and translate the said books, and for such expense as it shall be\r\n    his pleasure to incur in printing the same,--for these reasons we\r\n    have given and granted to him permission to print or cause to be\r\n    printed and to offer for sale the said books above mentioned for\r\n    four years following and succeeding the printing thereof. And so\r\n    we command you, that by virtue of this our present favour, warrant\r\n    and permission, you do allow the said petitioner to use and enjoy\r\n    the same, and do forbid in our name all tradesmen, printers,\r\n    booksellers, to print or cause to be printed, or to expose for\r\n    sale in any manner the said books during four years, on pain of\r\n    twenty-five silver marcs to be paid to us, and confiscation of the\r\n    books as to which they shall have been guilty; for such is our\r\n    pleasure. Given at Vannes, the XVIII day of June in the\r\n    year of grace one thousand five hundred thirty-one, and of our reign\r\n    the seventeenth.--Signed, Heruoet.\r\n\r\nOn the last page: 'The printing of this present book was finished by\r\nmaistre Geofroy Tory of Bourges Wednesday the fifth day of July in the\r\nyear M. D. XXXI. And it is for sale at Paris, opposite the \"Escu\r\nde Basle,\" Rue Sainct Iaques, and opposite the Church of La Magdeleine, at\r\nthe sign of the (\"a leeseigne [_sic_] du\") Pot Casse.'\r\n\r\nThe description we have given is that of the very complete copy owned by\r\nM. Ambroise Didot. M. Chedeau, an attorney at Saumur, owned a copy the\r\ntitle-page of which is different. It reads thus:--\r\n\r\n    ECONOMIC DE XENOPHON, CEST A DIRE: DOMESTIQUES INSTITUTIONS\r\n    ET ENSEIGNEMENS POUR BIEN REGIR SA FAMILLE ET AUGMENTER SON BIEN\r\n    PARTICULIER.

[Here the Pot Cassé.] Imprimees a Paris, a lenseigne\r\n    du Pot Casse, par ledict maistre Geofroy Tory, marchant libraire et\r\n    imprimeur du roy.--Avec privilege.\r\n\r\nThis title-page has the same border and the same form of the Pot Cassé\r\nas the other copy; but it has not on the verso the little list of other\r\npublications which we find on the latter, and which we have reproduced\r\nabove. As the first signature (A) of M. Chedeau's copy lacks four leaves,\r\nwe cannot say whether there are other differences in that signature; but\r\nas to the other signatures, B to I, they are identical in the two copies.\r\nThus we find in both the error to which we called attention above in the\r\nword 'enseigne' [printed 'eeseigne'], in the final note; better still,\r\nthis error has been corrected by hand, in the same way, in both copies,\r\nprobably by Tory himself. Which of the two is the earlier? I should not\r\nventure to say; however, it seems to me that the additional matter on the\r\nverso of the title-page of M. Didot's copy tends to prove that it is the\r\nlater of the two. In any event, the interval between the two impressions\r\ncannot have been a long one. If I interpret rightly certain circumstances,\r\nthe first signature, which had been kept in type (as is proved by a number\r\nof typographical defects which appear in both copies), was reprinted at\r\nthe same time with the last signature. Tory's dedicatory epistle, in M.\r\nDidot's copy, is dated July 5, the day when the printing of the book was\r\nfinished according to the final note. Now, to make it possible for him to\r\naffix this date to his preliminary epistle, we must concede that it had\r\nbeen kept in type until the book was finished. But may it not be that no\r\ndate was affixed on the first signature of the first impression? That is\r\na question that I am unable to answer, in view of the imperfect state of\r\nM. Chedeau's copy. It may be, too, that the first signature was reprinted\r\nin order to announce Tory's new address, he having very recently installed\r\nhis printing establishment in the famous old Halle au Blé de Beauce, on\r\nRue de la Juiverie, opposite the Church of La Madeleine. For it will\r\nbe observed that this address does not appear on the title-page of M.\r\nChedeau's copy, although we do find it in the note on the last page.\r\n\r\nThis volume is printed in the 'Champ fleury' type.\r\n\r\n\r\n16\r\n\r\n    POLITIQUES DE PLUTARCHE, CEST A DIRE: CIVILES INSTITUTIONS\r\n    ET ENSEIGNEMENS POUR BIEN REGIR LA CHOSE PU[BLIQUE], IADIS\r\n    COMPOSEES EN GREC PAR PLUTARCHE, ET DEPUIS TRANSLATEES DE GREC\r\n    EN LATIN PAR LE SEIGNEUR NICOLE SAGUNDIN, ET A PRESENT DE LANGUE\r\n    GRECQUE ET LATINE EN LANGAIGE FRANÇOIS PAR MAISTRE GEOFROY TORY\r\n    DE BOURGES.--Dediees par le dit autheur a lempereur Trajan,\r\n    et par le translateur en langaige françois a tresilustre et plain\r\n    de bon espoir en toute heureuse vertu, son seigneur, François de\r\n    Vallois, Daulphin de France.

The type and the ornamental letters are the same as in 'Champ\r\nfleury.'\r\n\r\nOn the second leaf is the following dedicatory epistle:--\r\n\r\n    _Geofroy Tory de Bourges to his most debonair lord, François de\r\n    Vallois, Daulphin de France, doth say and proffer most humble\r\n    greeting._\r\n\r\n    My lord, while translating this little book, I have oftentimes\r\n    reflected to whom of all my good friends I should the sooner\r\n    dedicate it, or whether I should dedicate it (as I have heretofore\r\n    done with certain other books which I have composed and translated\r\n    into the French tongue) to all studious and genuine lovers of\r\n    excellent reading and worthy pastime. But in fine, knowing thy\r\n    virtuous nature, likewise the mirror of all goodness and perfect\r\n    nobility wherein thou dost abundantly excel, and art ever disposed\r\n    for every blessed and goodly enterprise, I have considered that\r\n    before all other living men, of what state soever they may be, it\r\n    is to thy glorious lordship that I ought and am in duty bounden to\r\n    consecrate it, since it is thou under whom the public, not of France\r\n    alone, but of all Christendom, has its hope of living hereafter in\r\n    all felicity. I dedicate it to thee, not forgetting that thou hast\r\n    thy noble father the King, who, as Philip of Macedon did of yore to\r\n    his son Alexander, doth set before thee noble and goodly instruction\r\n    and examples of upright living; but also to the end that thou mayst\r\n    by times amuse thyself and read the excellent tales and teachings\r\n    which are marshalled herein as in a well-chosen library; and also\r\n    that, following thy noble and generous example, the studiously\r\n    inclined may, by reading the same, worthily profit thereby. Thou\r\n    mayst find herein many excellent passages, which will sometimes help\r\n    to comfort thee, and will be in some degree the means whereby thou\r\n    and thy Realm, with the grace of God, wilt ever prosper more and\r\n    more.\r\n\r\n    Paris, this XIIII day of June, M. D. XXXII.\r\n\r\nOn the verso of the last leaf: 'The printing of this present book was\r\nfinished Saturday the XV day of June, M. D. XXXII, by maistre Geofroy\r\nTory of Bourges, bookseller and king's printer, living in Paris, opposite\r\nthe church of La Magdeleine, at the sign of the Pot Casse.' [Here the Pot\r\nCassé, no. 9.]\r\n\r\nI have seen two copies of this book, one in M. Didot's library, the other\r\nin M. Alkan's.\r\n\r\nAnother edition was published at Lyon, in 1534, in 16mo, by Guillaume\r\nBoulle (or Boullé, for the name, in accordance with the custom of the\r\ntime, has no accent on the _e_). This is undoubtedly the one mentioned by\r\nDuverdier[240] as having been printed at Paris, in octavo, in 1530, by\r\nGuillaume Boullé. In this statement there are as many errors as there are\r\nwords. Guillaume Boullé's edition was not printed in Paris, it was not an\r\noctavo, and it cannot be dated 1530, as the first edition did not appear\r\nuntil 1532. Unfortunately La Caille did not take the trouble to verify\r\nDuverdier's statement, and he makes Guillaume Boullé a bookseller-printer\r\nof Paris.[241] Lottin, in his 'Catalogue des Libraries et Imprimeurs de\r\nParis,'[242] has not failed to copy La Caille, and to mention, under the\r\nyear 1530, a Guillaume Boullé, bookseller and printer in Paris, side by\r\nside with Jean Boullé, bookseller. Was this Jean, whom La Caille calls\r\nsimply Boulle, and whom he places in 1543, a kinsman of Guillaume? I\r\ncannot answer. However that may be, here is a full description of the\r\nedition of the 'Politiques' published by the latter. It is a 16mo volume\r\ncontaining 8 leaves of front matter and 104 of text. On the title-page,\r\nwhich is embellished by a roughly executed border, are these words:--\r\n\r\n'Politiques ou Civiles Institutions pour bien regir la Chose publ., iadis\r\ncomposees en grec par Plutarche, et despuys translatees en francoys par\r\nmaistre Geofroy Tory, et dediees par ledict translateur a tres illustre\r\nprince et plein de bon espoir en toute heureuse vertu, Francoys de\r\nValloys, Daulphin de France.\r\n\r\n'Disputation de Phavorin, philosophe, nouvellement y a este adioustee.\r\nItem chapitre demonstrant combien sont destatz de la Chose publ.\r\n\r\n'On les vend a Lyon, en la rue Merciere, a la boutique de Guillaume\r\nBoulle, libraire, a la fleur de lys d'or.--Avec privilege. 1534.'\r\n\r\nOn the verso of the title-page is an engraving representing Justice, with\r\nthis inscription: 'Justitia in sese virtutes continet omnes.'\r\n\r\nOn the following leaf is the dedication to the Dauphin.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the volume is the mark of Guillaume Boullé, or Boulle.\r\n\r\nThere is a copy of this little book at the Arsenal, and also one in the\r\nBibliothèque Nationale. The latter lacks the final leaf bearing the\r\nbookseller's mark, which some collector (!) has cut out, to enrich his\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\n\r\n17\r\n\r\n    LA MOUCHE DE LUCIAN, ET LA MANIERE DE PARLER ET SE TAIRE\r\n    [de Volaterran].

This pamphlet\r\nwas undoubtedly printed by Tory himself, subsequent to February 22, 1533;\r\nfor he assumes the title of bookseller to the University, which he did\r\nnot obtain until that date. Moreover, the acute accent, the apostrophe\r\nand the cedilla are used therein, and he did not make use of those marks\r\nuntil 1533. Lucian's 'La Mouche' [The Fly] fills 11 pages; the 'Maniere de\r\nParler' (an extract from the eighteenth book of Volaterran's 'Philosophy')\r\n3 pages. The first leaf has the title, and, on the verso, a note 'aux\r\nlecteurs.' The type used is the same as in 'Champ fleury.'\r\n\r\n\r\n18\r\n\r\n    LES REIGLES GENERALES DE LORTHOGRAPHE DU LANGAIGE FRANCOYS.\r\n\r\nSuch is the title of a book written by Tory, of which no trace remains. We\r\ndo not know even whether it was printed, although it is included in the\r\nlicense of the first edition of the 'Sommaire de Chroniques' of Egnasius,\r\ndated September 28, 1529. (See page 88.) Doubtless it was the complement\r\nof 'Champ fleury,' from a grammatical standpoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n19\r\n\r\n    TRANSLATION OF THE HIEROGLYPHS OF ORUS APOLLO; a manuscript\r\n    given by Tory to 'a noble and excellent friend' of his.[243]\r\n\r\nIt is not known whether this translation was printed. There are in\r\nexistence several old translations of Orus Apollo, but they do not bear\r\nTory's name.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 174: It goes without saying that in the numerous quotations\r\nwhich I shall make from these books I shall do away with abbreviations\r\nand supply punctuation.

In our day the\r\ncircumflex accent has been adopted for this purpose; but accented letters\r\ndid not exist in Tory's time, and he sought to utilise, in the interest of\r\nthe metre, the only distinctive sign at the disposal of typography, the\r\n_e_ with the cedilla, which was then generally used for _æ_, in imitation\r\nof the manuscripts of the Middle Ages. Tory also proposed to spell\r\nwith _s_, instead of _x_, certain words like _mixtum_; 'for,' he said,\r\n'_misceo_ has _miscui_ in the perfect; and so, by analogy, we must say\r\n_mistum_.'\r\n\r\nI will not comment here on some other observations of the same sort\r\nmade by Tory in this same note to the reader; I will say simply that\r\nthey all tend to prove his erudition and peremptorily contradict the\r\nextraordinary assertion of a certain Abbé Joly, who, in a huge folio,\r\nentitled _Remarques critiques sur le Dictionnaire de Bayle_, and published\r\nin 1740, observes that Tory was 'very ignorant,' without adducing a single\r\nfact in support of his opinion. In the _Menagiana_ (vol. iv, p. 84 of\r\nthe 12mo edition of 1729) Tory is rebuked, to be sure, for forging Latin\r\nwords, after the example of the author of the _Songe du Poliphile_; but\r\nthis is a less serious charge, and is not a proof of ignorance; on the\r\ncontrary it proves misuse of knowledge. Geofroy Tory, says the author,\r\nattracted by the style of the _Poliphile_, composed seven epitaphs filled\r\nwith words most worthy of a place in that work, 'such as _murmurillare_,\r\n_insatianter_, _hilaranter_, _pederaptim_, _velocipediter_,\r\n_ægrimoniosius_, _avicipes_, _conspergitare_, _venustulentissus_,\r\n_vinulentibibulus_, _apneumaticus_, and _collifrangibulum_, which he\r\nrepresented as ancient words, and which the excellent Catherinot, in his\r\nepitaph of this same Tory, did not fail to guarantee to be such.'--See\r\nwhat Catherinot has to say of Tory's _Epitaphs_ in his epitaph of Tory, p.\r\n44 supra.

In\r\nfact, the license is dated June 18, 1531, which seems to conflict with the\r\ndate of printing of the _Ædiloquium_. This circumstance also explains why\r\nthe second title of the book is different in the printed volume from that\r\ngiven in the license (_Erotica_).

BOOKS OF HOURS PUBLISHED BY TORY FOR HIMSELF.\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nHOURS OF THE VIRGIN.\r\n\r\nQuarto, in Latin.\r\n\r\nThis is a superb volume, printed by Simon de Colines, with borders and\r\nillustrations 'à l'antique,' perfect in taste and in the execution of the\r\nengravings. The book was, in all probability, printed by Tory and Colines\r\non joint account, as copies are extant in the name of each.\r\n\r\nFollowing are descriptions of three sorts of copies which I have seen,\r\nand which have been mistakenly assumed by bibliographers to be distinct\r\neditions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n    I. HORÆ, IN LAUDEM BEATISS. SEMPER VIRGINIS MARIÆ SECUNDUM\r\n    CONSUETUDINEM CURIÆ ROMANÆ. VBI ORTHOGRÁPHIA, PUNCTA & ACCENTUS SUIS\r\n    LOCIS HABENTUR.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBelow is Colines's large mark with the rabbits and the letters S. D. C.\r\nin the centre, and at the foot, S. DE COLINES. The imprint is:\r\n'Parisiis. Apud Simonem Colinæum. M.D.XXIIII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe first page is ornamented with a special border, which we shall find\r\nin others of Tory's books. The only copy of this form of the book which I\r\nhave had an opportunity to examine, namely, the one in the Bibliothèque\r\nde l'Arsenal, although it is bound in paper only, has a beautiful drawing\r\nin miniature which occupies the whole of this page. It represents two\r\nprinters working at a press, and a compositor in front of his case. None\r\nof the printing has been retained, save the five lines of the title,\r\n'Horæ,' etc., which are enclosed in a scroll hanging from the upper\r\nbranches of two trees which form the frame of the miniature. I do not\r\nknow the name of the fortunate recipient of this gift. One sees only his\r\ninitials (R. P.) in a heart above the press.\r\n\r\nOn the verso of the title we find, in accordance with custom, the table\r\nof Easter Days, etc., from 1523 to 1551. The border of the page has, in\r\nthree small reserved scrolls in the midst of the arabesques, the words:\r\nGEOFROY--TORY--SIC VT NON PLVS, which recur from time to time on\r\nthe following pages. This border is reproduced on the title-page of each\r\npart of the book.\r\n\r\nThe license occupies the whole of both sides of the second leaf, which is\r\nwithout borders, for a special reason: it is printed in gothic type of the\r\nperiod (to imitate the script of the diploma) and that style of type would\r\nhave quarrelled with the antique arabesques of Tory, whose refined taste\r\navoided incongruities of that sort.\r\n\r\nAn extract from the license follows:--\r\n\r\n'Francoys, by the grace of God King of France, to the Bailli and Provost\r\nof Paris, the Seneschal of Lyon, and all other justiciars, officials,\r\nor their deputies, and to each of them in his jurisdiction, and as to\r\nhim shall appertain, greeting. Our dear and well-beloved maistre Geofroy\r\nTory, bookseller, living at Paris, hath now caused it to be made known\r\nand shown unto us that he hath of late made and caused to be made certain\r\npictures and vignettes \"à l'antique,\" and likewise certain others \"à la\r\nmoderne,\" to the end that the same may be printed and made use of in\r\ndivers books of Hours, whereupon he hath employed himself a very long\r\ntime, and hath made divers great expenditures, and outlay. Wherefore,\r\nand to enable him to recover a part of the outlay that he hath made and\r\nundergone while employed in procuring the aforementioned drawings and\r\nvignettes to be made; and to the end that he may have the wherewithal\r\nto live with more ease, he hath most humbly caused to be laid before us\r\nhis petition and request that he alone and no other may have authority\r\nto cause the aforementioned drawings and vignettes to be printed, for\r\nthe space and term of six years, beginning on the day of the printing of\r\nsaid Hours, and that all booksellers be forbidden to make or to cause to\r\nbe made any impression thereof, whether on a white, grey, or red field,\r\nnot omitting any of the said black vignettes, or to reduce them \"a petit\r\nou grant pied\"; humbly beseeching us to that end. Wherefore we, having\r\nduly considered these matters, and generously acceding to the petition\r\nand request of the said petitioner, and likewise in recognition of his\r\nlearning, literary talent, and the excellent and praiseworthy report made\r\nto us of his person, and of his talents, competency, loyalty, wisdom, and\r\ngoodly diligence, have granted to him the privilege that he and no other\r\nmay print and cause to be printed the said vignettes and drawings, and\r\ndo forbid all booksellers and printers whomsoever within our realm, to\r\nmake or procure to be made and printed the said vignettes and drawings,\r\non pain of a fine of five and twenty silver marks to be paid to us, and\r\nconfiscation of the Hours, vignettes, and pictures by them so printed.\r\nGiven at Avignon, the XXIII day of September, in the year of\r\ngrace one thousand five hundred twenty-four, and of our reign the tenth.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe third leaf contains some details concerning the calendar, which begins\r\non the fourth leaf and ends on the ninth. The border of the lower part of\r\nleaf Avij is turned upside down. The Hours begin on the tenth leaf.\r\n\r\nThe book is a quarto, but the sheets are folded two by two, after\r\nthe style introduced by Pierre Schoiffer himself, which gives it the\r\nappearance of an octavo. The signatures run from A to T, which makes\r\neighteen folds, or one hundred and forty-four leaves.\r\n\r\nThe engravings consist of sixteen complete borders, one of which\r\nis repeated on the recto and verso of each of the first sixteen\r\nleaves, embracing thirty-two pages of text, after which the same\r\ndecorations reappear. They are composed of arabesques in which,\r\nfrom time to time, these words appear at the sides: SOLI\r\nDEO--LAVS--HONOR--GEOFROY--TORY--NON PLVS. At the foot of certain\r\npages we see a crowned F (the first letter of the king's name), a crowned\r\nC (the first letter of the name of Queen Claude, daughter of Louis XII),\r\nand a crowned dolphin (daulphin), in allusion to the title of the king's\r\neldest son. Queen Claude died before the book was finished, perhaps even\r\nbefore the printing was begun; but Tory did not choose to waste the\r\nwoodcut of her, so it was preserved and was used for more than fifteen\r\nyears, as we shall see. These three subjects are reproduced in Dibdin's\r\n'Bibliographical Decameron' (vol. i, page 99); there are two others in\r\nthe same work (vol. ii, page 65). At the foot of the other pages are\r\narabesques, among which we find the Pot Cassé, no. 2. In the text there\r\nare thirteen large drawings, which harmonize admirably with the borders.\r\nAll the illustrations, or almost all, borders and drawings alike, are\r\nsigned with the Lorraine cross.\r\n\r\nThe book ends on the recto of a leaf on the verso of which is this\r\ncolophon: EXCVDEBAT SIMON COLINÆVS PARISIIS E REGIONE SCHOLARVM\r\nDECRETORVM: ANNO A CHRISTI IESV NATIVITATE M. D. XXV. XVII. CAL. FEBR.\r\n\r\nThis date coincides with January 16, 1525. We have seen that the\r\ntitle-page bears the date 1524, that is to say, the year when the book was\r\nbegun. These two dates, cited separately, have led bibliographers astray,\r\nand have given rise to a theory that there are two different editions of\r\nthe same book.\r\n\r\nHere and there throughout the volume we find figures in the borders. These\r\nfigures are: 16, which appears on the inner side of leaves Ai verso and\r\nCvij recto and verso; 3, on the outer side of the border of leaves Aiiij\r\nrecto and verso, and Ciiij recto and verso; 10, at the foot of leaf Biij;\r\n12, on the outer side of the border of leaf Bvi. Here and elsewhere,\r\nto make my descriptions more clear, these books having no pagination,\r\nI assign signature letters to the eight sheets of each fold; but it is\r\ncommon knowledge that they actually appear on the first four only. I feel\r\njustified in concluding from these figures that at first certain numbers,\r\nrunning from 1 to 16, were engraved, and repeated on each compartment of\r\nthe same border, in order to enable the compositor to assort the pages\r\nproperly. Later these numbers were probably deemed to be of no use and\r\nwere cut off. The four that I have noticed, having inadvertently been\r\nleft, were finally removed before the printing was concluded. The scheme\r\nof repeating each border on the recto and verso of the same leaf was very\r\ningenious, for it permitted the imposition of a larger number of pages\r\nwithout calling attention to the repetition, as the two similar pages\r\nwere never seen at the same time. This required no more work, for it is\r\nvery clear that the borders were not added to the pages until the very\r\nmoment of printing, so that they might not be exposed to the accidents\r\ninherent in the preparatory handling. M. Willemin has reproduced several\r\nspecimens of these borders in his 'Monuments Français Inêdits' (folio,\r\n1839), page 296.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe book contains, as we have said, thirteen large cuts (all of which\r\nexcept the second are signed with the Lorraine cross). They are as follows:\r\n\r\n1 and 2. The Angelic Salutation, in two plates facing each other.\r\n\r\n3. The Visitation of the Virgin, with the device 'non plus' in a scroll\r\nsuspended from a tree.\r\n\r\n4. The Birth of Jesus.\r\n\r\n5. The Adoration of the Shepherds.\r\n\r\n6. The Adoration of the Magi.\r\n\r\n7. The Circumcision.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n8. The Flight into Egypt.\r\n\r\n9. The Coronation of the Virgin.\r\n\r\n10. The Crucifixion of Jesus. This design has five compartments. In\r\naddition to the Crucifixion, there are bees at work, birds building their\r\nnests, a peasant ploughing a field, and another shearing sheep. Each of\r\nthese four is accompanied by the device 'sic vos non vobis.'\r\n\r\n11. The Descent of the Holy Spirit on the Apostles, with the device 'non\r\nplus' on the pediment of a temple.\r\n\r\n12. The Penance of David, with the same device, and the word 'peccavi' in\r\na scroll suspended from a tree.\r\n\r\n13. The Triumph of Death. This last cut represents Death, armed with a\r\nspear treading on corpses. A crow on a tree above him has the words 'cras,\r\ncras,' issuing from its beak. At either side are the devices 'non plus'\r\nand 'sic ut,' on neighbouring buildings.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nII. There are two sorts of copies in Tory's name. The first are\r\nidentical in every respect with those of Colines, except as to the first\r\npage, where, after the title: 'Horæ ... habentur,' we find this imprint:\r\n'Parisiis, apud Magistrum Gotofredum Torinum Bituricum. Ad insigne vasis\r\neffracti, in via Iacobæa; gallice, Au pot casse, en la rue sainct Iaques.'\r\n\r\nHere the Pot Cassé, no. 3, with the device 'menti bonæ deus occurrit' at\r\nthe top, and 'non plus' at the foot.\r\n\r\nThere is no date on the title-page, but there is one on the last\r\npage,--the same that we find in the copies in Colines's name (see page\r\n111). I have seen a copy of this book in the collection of M. Double,\r\nwho kindly allowed me to study it in detail. It is still in its antique\r\nbinding, and on the covers, in large roman letters, is this device, which\r\nis believed to be that adopted by the unfortunate Dolet:\r\n\r\n    D[OMI]NE REDIME ME A CALVMNIIS\r\n    HOMINVM VT CVSTODIAM\r\n    MANDATA TVA.\r\n\r\n    D[OMI]NE IVSTICIA TVA IVSTICIA\r\n    IN ETERNVM ET LEX\r\n    TVA VERITAS.\r\n\r\nIII. Other copies in Tory's name have a title-page in French,\r\nwith no border. This title-page reads as follows:--\r\n\r\n'HEURES, A LA LOUANGE DE LA VIERGE MARIE, SELON LUSAGE DE ROME.\r\nESQUELLES SONT CONTENUES LES QUATRE PASSIONS, LE SERUICE COMMUN POUR LE\r\nTEMPS DAPRES PASQUES, ET POUR LE CARESME, LE SERUICE DE LADUENT, ET DUDIT\r\nADUENT JUSQUES A LA PURIFICATION NOSTRE DAME. PAREILLEMENT, LES HEURES\r\nDE LA CROIX, ET DU SAINCT ESPERIT, LES SEPT PSEAUMES, VESPRES, VIGILES,\r\nET COMMENDACES DES TRESPASSEZ, AVEC RAISONNABLE NOMBRE DORAISONS, ET\r\nSUFFRAGES DES SAINCTZ ET SAINCTES.\r\n\r\nA la fin sont les heures de la Conception nostre Dame, et le symbole de\r\nAthanase. Le tout au long, sans y rien requerir, est tres correcte, en\r\nbonne orthographie de poinctz, daccens, et diphthongues situez aux lieux a\r\nce requis. Et sont a vendre par Maistre Geofroy Tory de Bourges, libraire\r\ndemourant a Paris sus Petit pont, ioignant lhostel Dieu, a lenseigne du\r\nPot Casse.' Then follows the device 'menti bonæ devs occvrrit,' and the\r\nPot Cassé in the same form as that on the title-page of the preceding\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\nThe order of the contents of the first signature is here a little\r\ndifferent from that followed in numbers one and two. On the verso of the\r\ntitle the license begins, set in roman letters, which Tory preferred to\r\nthe gothic; it occupies two pages, as in the other copies, but those pages\r\nare supplied with the antique borders. On the verso of the second leaf\r\nis the table of Easter-Days, from 1525 to 1552. It is more conveniently\r\nplaced here than on the verso of the title, where it is separated from\r\nthe calendar by the license. Advantage was taken of the reprinting of\r\nthe first signature to remove the figure 16 from the border of the page\r\ncontaining the table of Easter-Days, and to set right the lower section of\r\nthe border of page A vij recto, which is upside down in the other copies.\r\nThe figure 3 was not removed from page A iiij, probably because the second\r\nside of that signature was not reprinted; but the 10 has disappeared from\r\npage B iij, which would seem to show that the second side of signature B\r\nwas reprinted. The first side of signature T was reprinted also, in order\r\nto change the colophon on the last page, for which this is substituted:\r\n'Ces presentes heures a lusage de ROME furent acheuees de\r\nimprimer le MARDY dixseptiesme iour de IANVIER Mil cinq\r\ncens vingtcinq: pour maistre GEOFROY TORY de BOURGES,\r\nlibraire demorant a PARIS sus PETIT PONT, ioignant\r\nlhostel DIEU, a lenseigne du POT CASSE.' (The words\r\nprinted in small capitals are printed in red in the book.) This is\r\nfollowed by the mark no. 5, with the two mottoes ('menti,' etc., and\r\n'sic,' etc.), which accompany that mark on page 43 of 'Champ fleury.' (See\r\nsupra, p. 21.)\r\n\r\nTory had several copies printed on vellum; I myself have seen one of them,\r\nbelonging to the collection of M. Sauvageot.[244]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the date affixed to these copies that they were not\r\nprinted until the day following the printing of those which bear the\r\nname of Colines; for it is worth noting that the Tuesday, January 17, is\r\nof 1525, and not of 1526 new style, as would have been the case had the\r\n'use of Paris' been followed. But Tory thought, doubtless, that he should\r\nfollow the Roman usage in a book of Hours to the use of Rome.\r\n\r\nI imagine that this reprinting of three signatures of the Hours of\r\n1524-1525 was done mainly to direct the attention of the public to\r\nTory's new establishment 'sus Petit Pont.' And this circumstance leads\r\nme to believe that it was done subsequent to January 17, 1525, for it\r\nis not conceivable that Tory would have left his former address, rue\r\nSaint-Jacques, on the copies printed as late as January 16, if he was to\r\nbe settled 'sus Petit Pont' on the 17th. He retained that date on the\r\nreissue, although it really took place later, in order to conform to\r\nthe terms of the license, which imposed upon the beneficiary the duty\r\nof specifying on the books the date when they were first published, so\r\nthat the date of its expiration might be fixed, unless the term should\r\nbe extended, as was done in the case of this very book of Hours; witness\r\nthe license of 'Champ fleury,' dated September 5, 1526. Indeed, my own\r\nopinion is that Tory did not remove to the Petit-Pont until about the\r\ndate last mentioned. We shall see that he remained there until 1530, when\r\nthe installation of his printing-office required him to take more roomy\r\nquarters. However, when he opened his shop on the Petit-Pont he did not\r\nabandon his place on rue Saint-Jacques, which he still occupied at least\r\nas late as 1531.\r\n\r\nM. Niel owns a copy of this book, in which the cuts are coloured in\r\nwater-colour, lined with gold. M. Niel thinks that the arabesques are\r\nadapted from those of Raphael in the Vatican, which had lately been\r\nreproduced; the lamented Renouvier, who agreed with M. Niel in attributing\r\nthe colouring to Tory, considered it an admirable piece of work.\r\n\r\nIt will not fail to be noticed, moreover, that Tory calls attention on\r\nthe title-page of his copies to the excellent orthography of his book: an\r\nadditional proof that this reimpression was subsequent to 1525.\r\n\r\nTory lent his borders and his engravings to several printers, who\r\nfrequently removed his mark therefrom. I will mention particularly five\r\npublications of Simon de Colines on the title-pages of which we find\r\nTory's borders.\r\n\r\nI. 'Divi Joannis Chrisostomi liber contra Gentiles,' etc.;\r\nquarto, 1528. The title-page is surrounded by one of Tory's borders,\r\nwith the crowned F at the foot, and the broad upright section with\r\nthe two scrolls containing the words 'Geofroy Tory,' which have been\r\nremoved.--There is a copy of this volume, in vellum, in the library of M.\r\nSolomon de Rothschild, who has kindly sent me this information.\r\n\r\nII. 'Rodolphi Agricolæ Phrisii de inventione dialectica libri\r\ntres, cum scholiis Joannis Matthæi Phrissemii'; quarto, 1529 and 1538.\r\nBorder composed of two broad upright sections, one of which was used in\r\nthe preceding. A crowned F at the top, and another broad section at the\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nIII. 'Laurentii Vallæ de linguæ latinæ elegantia libri III';\r\nquarto, 1535 and 1538. Same border as in the preceding.[245]\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nIn 1527 Tory published a new edition of his Hours, in one volume,\r\noctavo, printed as before by Simon de Colines, in roman type, with\r\nvignettes of the same sort, but much smaller. There is a copy on vellum\r\nat the Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal; unluckily it lacks the first and last\r\nleaves. According to M. Brunet,[246] to whom M. Tosi, of Milan, sent the\r\ndescription of a perfect copy, also on vellum, the first page reads:\r\n'Horæ in laudem Beatiss. Virg. Mariæ ad usum Romanum venales extant\r\nParrhisiis ad insigne vasis effracti.' And the last: 'Hujusmodi Horæ nuper\r\nabsoluebantur a prælo Colineo, die vicesima prima Octobris anno Domini\r\n1527, pro magistro Gotofredo Torino Biturigico Bibliopola ad insigne vasis\r\neffracti Parrhisiis commorante, ubi venales beneuolis omnibus amicabiliter\r\nextant.'\r\n\r\nWe give herewith an extract from the license of this new publication,\r\nwhich license included also 'Champ fleury' and the Hours of 1524-1525:\r\n\r\nFrançois, by the grace of God King of France, to the Provost of Paris,\r\nthe Bailli of Rouen and the Seneschal of Lyon, and to all our other\r\njusticiars and officials and their deputies, and to each of them as to him\r\nshall appertain, greeting. Our dear and well-beloved maistre Geofroy Tory\r\nde Bourges, bookseller, living at Paris, hath now caused it to be made\r\nknown and shown unto us that, in order to proclaim, exalt and embellish\r\nthe Latin and French tongues, he hath not long since made and composed\r\na book in prose and in the French language entitled: 'Lart et science\r\nde la deue et vraye proportion des lettres attiques, autrement dictes\r\nantiques et vulgairement lettres romaines, proportionnees selon le corps\r\net visaige humain'; the which book he hath caused to be placed before\r\nus, soliciting and requesting us to grant unto him leave, permission and\r\nlicense to print, or cause to be printed the said book, together with\r\ncertain drawings and vignettes 'à l'antique and à la moderne'; likewise\r\nfriezes, borders, crowns and scrolls; also to cause to be printed books\r\nof Hours, in such form and of such size as to him shall seem good, during\r\nthe time and term of ten years, beginning on the day of the printing of\r\nsaid Book and said Hours; together with an extension for the same term\r\nfor certain drawings and vignettes by him heretofore printed.--We hereby\r\ngive you to know, that we, in consideration of the foregoing, generously\r\nacceding to the petition and request of the said maistre Geofroy Tory,\r\nand having regard to the toil, labour, outlays and expense which it hath\r\nbehooved him to undergo and sustain, as well in the composition of the\r\nsaid books, as for the engraving of the said drawings, vignettes, friezes,\r\nborders, crowns and scrolls to accompany the said Hours, as hereinbefore\r\nmentioned, in divers forms and sizes,--have granted to him the privilege\r\nof printing the said books, enjoining you not to allow any other printers\r\nor booksellers within our realm, domains and seignories to print the said\r\nbooks and Hours, on pain of one hundred silver marcs to be paid to us,\r\nand of confiscation of said books. Given at Chenonceau the fifth day of\r\nSeptember, in the year of grace one thousand five hundred twenty-six, and\r\nof our reign the twelfth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn this new book of Hours there are thirty-two different borders, which\r\nreappear on every second leaf--one hundred and twenty-eight in all. The\r\ntext is embellished by sixteen large subjects, naturally smaller, however,\r\nthan those in the quarto. In the copy at the Arsenal, the only one that\r\nI have seen, these subjects are coloured. I did not discover Tory's mark\r\nanywhere; but his mottoes do appear,--'menti bonæ devs occvrrit'; 'sic\r\nvt, vel vt'; 'non plvs';--which proves that these plates were engraved for\r\nhim, if not by him.\r\n\r\nA list of the drawings follows:--\r\n\r\n    1 and 2. The Angelic Salutation; two plates on adjoining pages, as\r\n    in the quarto of 1524-1525.\r\n\r\n    3. The Visitation of the Virgin.\r\n\r\n    4. The Birth of Jesus.\r\n\r\n    5. The Annunciation to the Shepherds.\r\n\r\n    6. The Adoration of the Magi.\r\n\r\n    7. The Circumcision.\r\n\r\n    8. The Flight into Egypt.\r\n\r\n    9. The Coronation of the Virgin.\r\n\r\n    10. St. Joachim and St. Anne Embracing (this is not included in the\r\n    edition of 1524-1525).\r\n\r\n    11. The Crucifixion.\r\n\r\n    12. The Descent of the Holy Spirit on the Apostles.\r\n\r\n    13. The Penance of David.\r\n\r\n    14. The Triumph of Death.\r\n\r\n    15. The Holy Trinity.\r\n\r\n    16. The Virgin and the Child Jesus.\r\n\r\n    (The last two are not included in the edition of 1524-1525.)\r\n\r\nThe signatures run from A to Z; that is to say, there are twenty-three\r\noctavo sheets.\r\n\r\nThe copy of the octavo Hours of 1527 at the Arsenal is a lovely volume\r\nprinted on vellum, with a number of manuscript prayers in French added at\r\nthe end. The calligraphic execution of these prayers, which are surrounded\r\nby borders in imitation of those in the book, is wonderfully fine. The\r\ncolouring of the plates and the illuminating of the initial letters and\r\nof those at the ends of paragraphs make the volume of great value. It is\r\nstill in its original binding (once very sumptuous, but now sadly out of\r\nrepair), on the covers of which one can distinguish interlaced C's, barred\r\nS's, and star-shaped figures formed of two triangles turned end for end.\r\nCan it have belonged to Catherine de Médicis, who became the consort of\r\nHenri II in 1533? Unluckily it lacks two essential leaves, the first and\r\nthe last.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nIn the same year, Tory had printed by Simon Dubois ('Silvius') a quarto\r\nedition of this same book of Hours, 'suivant l'usage de Paris.'\r\n\r\nIt is dated October 22, 1527. It contains the new license, and comprises\r\nthirty-six quarto sheets, folded two by two according to custom, and\r\nforming eighteen octavo signatures, A to S. The book is printed throughout\r\nin the gothic type of that time, with the borders 'à la moderne' mentioned\r\nin the license of 1524, consisting of arabesques of flowers, insects,\r\nanimals, etc. There are twenty-six complete borders, which recur in\r\nregular order. We find again here, as in the first quarto, thirteen large\r\nsubjects interspersed through the text. But a noteworthy fact is, that\r\nalthough these subjects, with two exceptions,[247] are the same as those\r\nin the first quarto, they are of entirely different designs, appropriate\r\nto the 'modern' borders and type. It would be difficult to carry further\r\nthe love of artistic harmony. Neither the borders nor the illustrations\r\nbear Tory's mark, and I doubt whether they are his. Perhaps the design was\r\nPerreal's and the engraving by one of the artists employed by Tory, who\r\nmust then have had an organized workshop, if we may judge from the number\r\nof works which he produced about that time.\r\n\r\nDibdin speaks enthusiastically of this edition of the Hours, in his\r\n'Bibliographical Decameron'; he even reproduces four of the large cuts\r\nby which it is illustrated.[248] He says that it is the 'most beautiful\r\nwork' of that sort that he has ever seen, and expresses great surprise\r\nthat the arabesques have been cast aside. I confess that I do not share\r\nhis feeling. The book seems to me badly done, both from the artistic and\r\nfrom the typographical standpoint: the borders do not harmonize, they\r\nare out of proportion, and the engraving does not impress me as beyond\r\nreproach. But Dibdin's opinion is, as everybody knows, very unreliable;\r\nhis carelessness is proverbial. Indeed, he gives us a striking instance of\r\nit in this very passage: for he tells us that this book was published by\r\nTory of 'Bruges,' and that it has on the title, the Pot Cassé of Simon du\r\nBois[249]; two errors in one line!\r\n\r\nAmong the small cuts at the foot of the pages, we observe the shield of\r\nFrance; the crowned F; the crowned salamander; the crest of the king's\r\nmother, 'party' of France and of Savoy, with her widow's girdle; her\r\ninitial (L), crowned; the shield 'party' of Navarre and of France, with\r\nthe letters H and M intertwined (the initials of Henri d'Albert, King of\r\nNavarre, and Marguerite, sister of François I, whose marriage had been\r\ncelebrated January 24, 1526[250]); the Pot Cassé, no. 1, that is to say,\r\nin its simplest form, etc.\r\n\r\nThe exact title of this book is as follows: 'Hore in laudem beatissime\r\nVirginis MARIE: secundum consuetudinem ECCLESIE PARISIENSIS.' (Here the\r\nPot Cassé, no. 9.) 'Venales habentur PARRHISIIS, APUD MAGISTRUM GOTOFREDUM\r\nTorinum Biturigicum: SUB INSIGNE VASIS EFFRACTI: GALLICO SERMONE AU POT\r\nCASSE.'--All the words here printed in small capitals are printed in red.\r\nOn the verso of the title-page is the license, dated September 5, 1526. At\r\nthe end of the book is the following: 'Ces presentes Heures a lusage de\r\nParis, privilegiees pour dix ans commenceans a la presente date de leur\r\nimpression, furent achevees dimprimer le vingt deuxiesme iour Doctobre,\r\nMil cinq cens vingt sept, par maistre Simon du bois, imprimeur, pour\r\nmaistre Geofroy Tory de Bourges, qui les vend a Paris a lenseigne du Pot\r\nCasse.' (Here the same mark as on the first page.)\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that, although Tory felt bound to give the title of the\r\nbook in Latin, he could not forbear to print his address in French.\r\n\r\nThis is the order of the plates, all of which measure nine centimetres by\r\nsix:--\r\n\r\n    1 and 2. The Angelic Salutation, in two plates on successive pages\r\n    (fol. f 3 verso, and f 4 recto).\r\n\r\n    3. The Sibyl of Tibur (see the description on page 123, note 1),\r\n    fol. g 8 recto.\r\n\r\n    4. Jesus on the Cross, fol. h 6 recto.\r\n\r\n    5. The Descent of the Holy Spirit on the Apostles, fol. h 7 recto.\r\n\r\n    6. The Birth of Jesus, fol. i 1 recto.\r\n\r\n    7. The Annunciation to the Shepherds, fol. i 6 recto.\r\n\r\n    8. The Adoration of the Magi, fol. k 2 recto.\r\n\r\n    9. The Presentation in the Temple, fol. k 6 recto.\r\n\r\n    10. The Flight into Egypt, fol. l 2 recto.\r\n\r\n    11. The Coronation of the Virgin, fol. l 7 recto.\r\n\r\n    12. David Playing the Harp, fol. m 5 recto.\r\n\r\n    13. The Triumph of Death, fol. n 7 recto.\r\n\r\nM. Brunet[251] mentions a copy of this book on vellum. The Bibliothèque\r\nNationale owns one on paper, bound by Capé, with tooling copied from\r\nTory's.\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nHOURS OF THE VIRGIN, in roman type, with borders and arabesques\r\n'à l'antique' on each page. A small 16mo volume, printed by Tory, February\r\n8, 1529 (old style).\r\n\r\nHere is a description of this little gem, taken from the only copy that I\r\nhave seen, M. Niel's, which is on vellum.\r\n\r\nThe title reads thus:--\r\n\r\n'HORÆ IN LAUDEM BEATISSIMÆ VIRGINIS MARIÆ, SECUNDUM USUM\r\nROMANUM.' Then the Pot Cassé, and at the foot of the page: 'Menti\r\nbonæ Deus occurrit.'\r\n\r\nOn the verso of the title-page:--\r\n\r\n'Rex christianiss. statuit ne quis alius a Gotofredo Torino Biturigico,\r\nBibliopola Parrhisiis habitante, imprimat aut imprimi faciat infra\r\ndecennium in toto regno hujusmodi coronamenta et figuras, sub pœna\r\ngravissima, ut in diplomate ad hoc obtento latissime patet.'\r\n\r\nThen comes an abstract of the pontifical license, undated; and on the\r\nfollowing leaf the table of Easter-Days from 1530 to 1552.\r\n\r\nOn the last page: 'Parrhisiis, apud Gotofredum Torinum Biturigicum, viii.\r\ndie febr. anno sal. M. D. XXIX,[252] ad insigne Vasis effracti.'\r\n\r\nThe signatures run from A to Y; that is to say, the book consists of 22\r\noctavo forms, or 176 leaves. The pages, which contain 21 lines of brevier,\r\nmeasure thus:--\r\n\r\n    Height, text alone     77 millimetres.\r\n    Height, with border    96 millimetres.\r\n    Width, text alone      29 millimetres.\r\n    Width, with border     48 millimetres.\r\n\r\nThe volume contains twenty-one small cuts, unsigned, but all engraved in\r\nTory's manner. Here is a list of them:--\r\n\r\n    1. Jesus on the Cross; a very small cut with five sections, like the\r\n    Crucifixion of the quarto of 1524-1525; that is to say, there are\r\n    bees at work, birds building their nests, a peasant ploughing, and\r\n    another shearing sheep.\r\n\r\n    2 and 3. The Angelic Salutation; two cuts facing each other, as in\r\n    the Hours of 1524-1525.\r\n\r\n    4 and 5. The Visitation (idem).\r\n\r\n    6 and 7. The Birth of Jesus (idem).\r\n\r\n    8 and 9. The Annunciation to the Shepherds (idem).\r\n\r\n    10 and 11. The Adoration of the Magi (idem).\r\n\r\n    12 and 13. The Circumcision (idem).\r\n\r\n    14. The Massacre of the Innocents.\r\n\r\n    15. The Coronation of the Virgin.\r\n\r\n    16. The Crucifixion.\r\n\r\n    17. The Descent of the Holy Spirit.\r\n\r\n    18. Bathsheba at the Bath.\r\n\r\n    19. The Triumph of Death.\r\n\r\n    20. The Trinity (small cut).\r\n\r\n    21. The Virgin in a halo, with an angel on each side.[253]\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nBOOK OF HOURS, quarto; same typographical arrangement as in the\r\nquarto of 1524-1525. On the title-page, which has the border of those\r\ncopies of the earlier edition which bear the imprint of Simon de Colines,\r\nwe read:--\r\n\r\n'HORÆ IN LAUDEM BEATISS. VIRGINIS MARIÆ. AD USUM ROMANUM.--PARRHISIIS,\r\nAPUD GOTOFREDUM TORINUM BITURIGICUM, REGIUM IMPRESSOREM. (Then comes\r\nthe motto: MENTI BONÆ DEVS OCCVRRIT, and beneath it the Pot\r\nCassé.) Cum privilegio summi Pont. et Regis christianiss. ad decennium et\r\nultra, ut in calce hujus operis patet.'[254]\r\n\r\nOn the verso of the title the list of Easter-Days, from 1531 to 1560; then\r\nthe Calendar, the type in which this is set being so large that it was\r\nnecessary to omit the arabesques with figures at the foot of the border\r\nand substitute simple arabesques like those at the top.\r\n\r\nOn the recto of the last leaf is the abstract of the licenses, papal and\r\nroyal, and on the verso this colophon, set in the border of the last page\r\nof 'Champ fleury': 'Parrhisiis, ex officina Gotofredi Torini Biturigici,\r\nregii impressoris, ad insigne Vasis effracti, anno salu[tis] M. D.\r\nXXXI, die XX mensis octo[bris].' Then the Pot Cassé and at\r\nthe foot of the page:--\r\n\r\n    'Effracti, lector, subeas insignia vasis,\r\n      Egregios flores ut tibi habere queis.'\r\n\r\nThe volume consists of twenty signatures (A to V) of two sheets each,\r\nset in the roman type used in 'Champ fleury'; borders of the Hours of\r\n1524-1525; also the thirteen drawings of that edition, but with special\r\nborders in the form of porticoes, which appear in other minor works of\r\nTory published in 1531, of which we shall speak in the following section.\r\nIt is a fact worthy of remark that we no longer find the name Geofroy\r\nTory on his borders, and that even his mark has disappeared from several\r\nof the cuts, particularly the first cut of the Angelic Salutation,[255]\r\nthe Adoration of the Shepherds, the Adoration of the Magi, the Flight\r\ninto Egypt, the Coronation of the Virgin, the Penance of David, and the\r\nTriumph of Death. This circumstance leads me to believe that Tory had lent\r\nthese plates to other publishers, as he had lent his borders to Simon de\r\nColines, and that they removed the marks in order to appropriate more\r\ncompletely the publications in which the plates were used. This was what\r\nSimon de Colines did, as we have already seen (page 120).\r\n\r\nA no less interesting fact is that, in the borders, the crowned C's are\r\nretained, which refer to Claude de France, the first wife of François I,\r\nwho died in 1524 and was succeeded in 1530 by Eleonora of Austria.\r\n\r\nWe find also in this edition four unsigned cuts which do not appear in the\r\nquarto of 1524-1525:--\r\n\r\nFol. H 8. The Angelic Salutation; a special design, quarto size.\r\n\r\nFol. L 6. The Angelic Salutation; quite small, occupying only the upper\r\npart of a page.\r\n\r\nFol. R 7. The Trinity; small, with a special border.\r\n\r\nFol. V 3. The Virgin; small, with a special border.\r\n\r\nThe last two are taken from the 16mo Hours of 1529. The floriated letters\r\nare the same as in 'Champ fleury.'\r\n\r\nPapillon, who speaks of this book,[256] without giving the title, and\r\nattributes it to Woeiriot, who was not born in 1531, expresses himself\r\nthus concerning it: 'I have seen an old book in which there are some of\r\nhis engravings; it is an octavo, each page of which is surrounded by a\r\ndecorative border, in compartments, of a beautiful gothic type. They are\r\nengraved very correctly, even though it is line engraving, which is so\r\nfine, so even and so accurate, that I am at a loss to understand how it\r\ncould have been done. There are in this book fifteen or sixteen large\r\ncuts, also engraved in line; the drawing of the figures is passable. The\r\nlittle Lorraine cross, which Woeiriot used as a mark, may be seen in\r\nseveral places in the borders of this book.'\r\n\r\nM. de Rothschild's copy of this edition has one interesting peculiarity:\r\nit is enriched by a large plate, unsigned, printed on an oblong\r\nhalf-sheet, representing the Triumph of the Virgin Mary, which seems to\r\nbe an imitation of the Triumph of Apollo in 'Champ fleury.' The Virgin\r\nappears in a chariot drawn by unicorns; behind the chariot are the Captive\r\nWomen; around the chariot, Prudence, Temperance, Justice and Strength;\r\nin front of the unicorns, Hope, Faith, Charity; and farther in front the\r\nNine Muses, the Seven Liberal Arts, the handmaidens of the Virgin. In\r\nthe background, we see the Virginal Palace, the Palace of Jesse, and the\r\nTemple of Honour. Beneath the picture is an explanation in French verse,\r\nwhich begins thus:--\r\n\r\n    'Les antiques Cesars triompherent par gloire,\r\n    Mais par humilite (ainsi le faut il croire)\r\n    La noble Vierge va triomphante en bon heur\r\n    Du palais virginal jusquau temple dhonneur.'\r\n\r\nI have seen this engraving nowhere else except in a copy of the edition\r\nof the Hours published in 1542 by Olivier Mallard, of which I shall speak\r\nin the third part; but I have no doubt that it was included originally in\r\nall copies of the edition of 1531, perhaps also in that of 1524-1525. Its\r\nchances of preservation were injured by its being bound in the form of a\r\nmap. At all events this unsigned plate is in Tory's manner, and it can\r\nhardly be denied that it belongs to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nAt a time which I am unable to fix with precision, but not earlier than\r\nthe month of September, 1531, Tory printed another book, in octavo, with\r\nborders made up of plants, animals, insects, birds, etc., like those in\r\nthe quarto Hours of 1527, but, naturally, on a smaller scale. I have\r\nnever seen this book, but its existence is established to my satisfaction\r\nby the publication of a book of Hours, at a later date, by Olivier\r\nMallard, with the same borders and vignettes. I can give with certainty\r\nneither the title nor the date of printing of Tory's book; but the date\r\nof the engravings is readily determined approximately, thanks to certain\r\nornaments of Mallard's book. For instance, we find in it, as in the Hours\r\nof 1527, the crowned F and the salamander of François I, the crowned L\r\nand the biparted shield (France and Savoy) of his mother, who died in\r\n1531, and a blank shield which suggests the widowhood of François, and\r\nconsequently proves that these cuts were designed before July, 1530. As\r\nfor my ascription of these cuts to Tory, it is due to the style of the\r\nborders, which are copied from the Hours of 1527. Moreover, he has added a\r\nspecial symbol, namely, the coat-of-arms of Bourges (three sheep, placed\r\ntwo and one, and wearing collars), which appears now and again at the foot\r\nof the page, beside the symbols of François I and his mother. As I have\r\nsaid, I do not know the title of the book in which Tory first used these\r\ncuts; it seems to me, however, that we may fairly conclude from the use\r\nOlivier Mallard made of them that it was a book of Hours; Tory probably\r\ndecided to publish an octavo edition of his Hours 'à la moderne' of 1527,\r\nas he had published in 1527 an octavo edition of his Hours 'à l'antique'\r\nof 1524-1525. Indeed, it may be that the book in question is the one thus\r\ndescribed by M. Brunet: 'Horæ in laudem beatissimæ Virginis Mariæ ad usum\r\nRothomagensem.--Parisiis, ad insigne Vasis effracti. 1536.' Small octavo,\r\nroman type, line engravings.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the book is said to be printed at the sign of the Pot\r\nCassé, without mention of the printer's name. This may mean that it was\r\nprinted by Tory's widow, who published Macault's work in the same way in\r\n1535.\r\n\r\nWe shall speak elsewhere of Mallard's book, but this is the place to\r\nmention the engravings it contains, which doubtless appeared also in\r\nTory's book. In Mallard's publication of 1541 there are sixteen different\r\nborders, the same one being always placed on the recto and verso of each\r\nleaf, and nineteen of the plates of the 16mo edition of 1529. The two\r\nlacking are number 1 and number 21. [The engravings of The Visitation are\r\nreproduced below.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 244: It was bought for 3025 francs, exclusive of commissions,\r\nfor the Bibliothèque Impériale (in December, 1860).

[Paris, Geofroy Tory, 1531.]\r\n\r\nThis title is set within the charming title-page border of the Colines\r\ncopies of the Hours of 1524-1525. On the verso of the title-page: 'Il est\r\npermis,' etc., as in the preceding volume. On the second leaf the text\r\nbegins with a beautiful decorated letter (A) after the style of the L\r\nof the volume last described. This page also is set in a portico-shaped\r\nborder, with arabesques; but the latter are different from those in the\r\n'Sacre.'\r\n\r\nWe find, too, three other and different borders in the balance of the\r\nwork, which gives us in all six pages with borders in addition to that of\r\nthe title-page and that of the last page, which is identical with that of\r\nthe last page of 'Champ fleury'; some floriated letters also have been\r\nborrowed from this last-named work. Though none of these are signed, they\r\nare surely Tory's, so far as the designs are concerned, at least.\r\n\r\nThe text of this book, as of the preceding, is by Guillaume Bochetel, who\r\nsigned it. Following his text, Tory inserted a charming cut, representing\r\nthe gift presented by the city of Paris to the Queen--a magnificent\r\ncandelabrum. At the top are the words: 'Deseing du present faict a la\r\nRoyne en deux chandeliers.'[260] The license granted to Tory for printing\r\nthis book is identical with that of the preceding, except that it is dated\r\nat Anet, April 26, 1531. We learn from the last page that the printing was\r\nfinished on Tuesday, May 9, 1531.\r\n\r\nGeofroy Tory was not simply the printer of this little volume; he was also\r\nthe publisher, and he added to the text three poems in Latin, of his own\r\ncomposition. Here they are:--\r\n\r\n  _Geofroy Tory of Bourges to Queen Leonora._[261]\r\n\r\nWe are about to celebrate this triumph of yours, Leonora, which your\r\nParisians have conferred upon you. You are a queen so loving-kind to us\r\nthat we all can say that you are a real goddess. We can certainly say that\r\nyou are a benign goddess, since you at last bless us with grateful peace.\r\nWith peace you bless all who inhabit the French kingdom, so kind have\r\nbeen the fates in establishing you in power. As one upright, aye, holy,\r\ngentle, and a true bestower of blessings, you have brought our lilies back\r\nto their country. By your leave, I will speak in few words, and I will\r\nproclaim the truth: in you resides full national salvation for us all.\r\n\r\n  _The same to the same._\r\n\r\nMay the gods long continue your happy lot, Leonora. You are our Joy, our\r\nPeace, and our grateful Repose.\r\n\r\n  _The same Tory to the French People._\r\n\r\nExult and be glad, people of France; you see what happiness Leonora now\r\nbrings to you. She, sent, be sure, by the manifest will of God, enables\r\nyou at last to enjoy the blessings of peace. Strew roses, laurel, violets,\r\nnard, and saffron, and merrily revel to your hearts' content. But be\r\ncareful too that you, best of people, be not backward in rendering pious\r\nprayers to God. If you never cease to sing God's praises and to frequent\r\nhis temples, believe me, you will long enjoy the blessings of peace. You\r\nwill behold the golden ages beneath the smiling heaven, and on earth you\r\nwill reap in prosperity golden harvests. Add to this that you will in\r\nsimilar manner become a race all golden too. Continue, therefore, your\r\nholy services to the most high God.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n    IN LODOICÆ REGIS MATRIS MORTEM EPITAPHIA LATINA ET\r\n    GALLICA.--EPITAPHES A LA LOUENGE DE MA DAME MERE DU ROY FAICTZ PAR\r\n    PLUSIEURS RECOMMENDABLES AUTHEURS.

Tory, 1531.]\r\n\r\nThe license, dated Paris, October 13, 1531, and signed DE LA\r\nBARRE, like the two preceding, gives Tory at last the title of king's\r\nprinter: 'We have granted to maistre Geofroy Tory, marchant libraire et\r\n_imprimeur du Roy_, leave,' etc. On the last page, which, as well as the\r\nfirst, is set in a border,[262] are the words: 'Printed at Paris, at the\r\nsign of the Pot Cassé, by maistre Geofroy Tory de Bourges, bookseller and\r\nking's printer. The XVII day of October, M. D. XXXI.'\r\n\r\nAs the title-page indicates, this volume contains verses in Latin and in\r\nFrench by divers contemporary authors. Among the former is one by Geofroy\r\nTory himself, which I will give as a specimen.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Louise, royal mother, addresses and consoles her France: written by\r\nGeofroy Tory of Bourges._[263]\r\n\r\nFrance, why do you in deepest sorrow mourn for me? Do you not know that\r\nthe whole human race is destined to die? Revive, and consider how I by\r\nmy foresight preserved you from the bitter and ruthless enemy. I leave\r\nto you a son, king by divine will, who under my guidance cherishes you\r\nin glorious peace. Joyfully he beholds in your arms his pledges, who\r\nwill bring the whole world under your sway. You have a queen who is\r\nthe foster-daughter of virtue and peace, and who blesses your lot with\r\ngood fortune. You have also another queen, who is the sister and good\r\ncounselor of your consecrated king. With such guides as these, dear\r\nFrance, you should not complain. You are fortunate in having such leaders.\r\nMoreover, when I die, I will not desert you, for you have my immortal\r\nname. Devotedly I will ever pray for you before the mighty Thunderer,\r\nasking that you may reign victoriously and nobly. Strew laurel for me,\r\nviolets, nard, and saffron; strew also flowers, lilies, garlands, and\r\nroses. Add to these, moreover, hymns with most exalted praises, rites,\r\nmelodies, incense, myrrh, and prayers. Hesitate not to erect altars to me.\r\nFor, as a benign goddess, I now proceed to fly to Heaven. Farewell.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first two of these three opuscula exhibit three different kinds of\r\ntype: that of 'Champ fleury' and two others. In the third we find a fourth\r\nsize. It will be seen that Tory's printing-office was increasing in\r\nimportance.[264]\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n    ORDONNANCES DU ROY (François I), etc.\r\n\r\nQuarto, of four signatures (A to D). Paris, 1532.\r\n\r\nI have seen only the last signature of this collection. It has a special\r\ntitle-page, embellished by the border of the Colines copies of the Hours\r\nof 1524-1525; but the signature letter (D) and the first word of the title\r\ndemonstrate the existence of at least three others. It seems that Geofroy\r\nTory treated the legislative documents of François I in the sixteenth\r\ncentury as the Imperial printing-office treats the 'Bulletin des Lois'\r\nto-day: that is to say, each fold has a title, although it forms a part of\r\nthe same publication with that which precedes and that which follows.\r\n\r\nI transcribe the title of the signature that I have seen,[265] made up of\r\nsix leaves, that is a sheet and a half quarto[266] (_encartées_):--\r\n\r\nAUTRES ORDONNANCES NOUVELLES DU ROY NOSTRE SIRE SUR LESTAT DES\r\nTRESORIERS ET MANYMENT DES FINANCES, PUBLIEES EN LA CHAMBRE DES COMPTES\r\nET AU CONSEIL DE LA TOUR CARREE.

On the recto of the last leaf is the duplicate of\r\nthe license, in these words:--\r\n\r\n'The judges appointed by the king in the Chambre de la Tour Carree to\r\nadminister the finances, having considered the petition presented by\r\nGeofroy Tory, bookseller and king's printer, praying that he may have\r\npermission to print the ordinances of late issued by the king touching\r\nthe administration of his finances and the officers engaged therein,\r\nwhich have been published in said chamber, and that all other booksellers\r\nand printers may be forbidden to print or to cause to be printed the\r\nsaid ordinances until the expiration of three years next ensuing, on\r\npain of summary fine, the said judges have permitted and do permit the\r\nsaid Geofroy Tory to print the said ordinances, and forbid all other\r\nbooksellers and printers to print or cause to be printed the said\r\nordinances for one year,[267] on pain of summary fine.

On\r\nthe verso of the title, in the vellum copy at the Bibliothèque Nationale,\r\nis the final border of 'Champ fleury,' in which are depicted the arms of\r\nEngland, with the device, DIEV EST [_sic_] MON DROICT.\r\n\r\nThe author's exordium begins with a large letter S, decorated with an\r\nescutcheon bearing two fasces accompanied by nine besants, three by three,\r\nwith this device in Greek: MHKETI ('not at all'); these are\r\nMacault's arms, doubtless. This letter appears again on folio 148. Facing\r\nthe first page of text is a magnificent engraving representing François I\r\nsurrounded by his court, listening to Macault as he reads his book to the\r\nking. The author is represented in a clerical costume, with a calotte on\r\nhis head. Beside him are the three sons of François I: François, who died\r\na few years later, Henri, who became Henri II, and Charles, Duc d'Orléans.\r\nThis engraving is a faithful copy of the painting on Macault's original\r\nmanuscript, which was still in France in 1811, but has since crossed over\r\nto England. It is described in Part 3, section 1 (pages 166-168).\r\n\r\nThe printed book forms a quarto volume of 8 unnumbered preliminary leaves,\r\n152 numbered leaves (signatures A to Q), and 8 leaves of index: 168 leaves\r\nin all.

Then the arms of Michel\r\nde Boudet. On the verso: 'Cautum est privilegio, ne quis hoc Epicedium\r\nimprimat aut imprimi curet infra biennium subpöena in diplomate ad hoc\r\nobtento contenta.' The four following leaves contain a poem in honour of\r\nMichel de Boudet; on the sixth is the Pot Cassé, no. 6, and beneath it:\r\n'Parrhisiis, Anno salutis humanæ, M. D. XXX.' There is nothing\r\nto indicate the author of this little work, which is printed in the same\r\ntype as the Epitaphs in honour of the mother of François I.[271]\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n    APOLOGIE POUR LA FOI CHRESTIENNE CONTRE LES ERREURS CONTENUES EN\r\n    UN PETIT LIVRE DE MESSIRE GEORGES HALEVIN.\r\n\r\nParis, G.

For Pierre Roffet,\r\ncalled le Faulcheur. By maistre Geofroy Tory de Bourges, king's printer.\r\n\r\nOctavo, 1st edition. Only a single copy is known, now in the Bibliothèque\r\nNationale. The volume consists, first, of four preliminary leaves (half a\r\nfold), comprising: (1) the title which I have just transcribed; (2) on the\r\nverso, some laudatory verses, among which figures this distich of Tory,\r\nwho was not only Marot's printer, but his friend:--\r\n\r\n    'Vis lauros cypriasque comas, charitesque, iocosque,\r\n      Inde sales etiam nosse? Marotus habet';\r\n\r\n(3) Clément's letter 'to a large number of brethren,' dated August\r\n12, 1532, that is to say, on the same day that Tory finished printing\r\nthe book, and not August 12, 1530, as was erroneously printed in some\r\nsubsequent editions, which has given rise to a theory of an earlier\r\nissue[273]; (4) the table of contents; (5) a leaf entirely blank. Then\r\ncomes the text of the 'Adolescence Clementine,' extending from folio 1\r\nto folio 104, on which is the word 'finis'; and after that the 'Chant\r\nroyal,' etc., from 105 to 115. The book ends with a list of errata on an\r\nunnumbered folio (116). The table of contents, on one of the preliminary\r\nleaves, informs us that one ode had previously been published separately,\r\nbut no copy of it is known.\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n_The Same._\r\n\r\nA second edition of this book was published by the same bookseller, and\r\nthe printing finished by Tory on November 13, 1532. It differs from the\r\nfirst in this respect, that the text and preliminary leaves are joined,\r\nor, to speak more accurately, the first two of those leaves; for the table\r\nof contents is relegated to the end of the volume, in place of the errata,\r\nwhich no longer appear. The volume consists of a hundred and nineteen\r\nleaves, the last unnumbered. The word 'finis' still appears on folio\r\n104, after the 'Adolescence Clementine'; then comes the 'Chant royal,'\r\netc.; and lastly two leaves entitled: 'Autres Œuvres faictes en sa dicte\r\nmaladie,' indicated by this phrase on the title-page: 'Plus amples que les\r\npremiers imprimez de ceste, ny autre impression.' (Bibliothèque Mazarine.)\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n_The Same._\r\n\r\nA third edition was printed by Tory on February 12, 1532 (1533, new\r\nstyle), like the preceding in every respect, but having only 118 leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\n_The Same._\r\n\r\nA fourth edition appeared June 7, 1533, identical with the preceding,\r\nexcept that the words on the title-page, 'plus amples,' etc. are replaced\r\nby these: 'Avec certains accens notez, cest assavoir sur le é masculin\r\ndifferent du feminim [_sic_], sur les dictions ioinctes ensembles par\r\nsinalephes, et soubz le ç quant il tient de la prononciation de le s, ce\r\nqui par cy devant par faulte daduis n'a este faict au langaige françoys,\r\ncombien q'uil [_sic_] y fust et soit tres necessaire.'\r\n\r\nThis fourth edition of the 'Adolescence Clementine' was the last work\r\nprinted by Tory to my knowledge. In the intervals between these four\r\neditions, however, he had published the works of Clément Marot's father,\r\nedited by Clément himself, under the following title:--\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\n    IAN MAROT DE CAEN, SUR LES DEUX HEUREUX VOYAGES DE GENES &\r\n    VENISE, VICTORIEUSEMENT MYS A FIN, PAR LE TRESCHRESTIEN ROY LOYS\r\n    DOUZIESME DE CE NOM, PERE DU PEUPLE.

ICONOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I have hitherto called attention to the books that we owe to Tory\r\nwhether as publisher, as author, or as printer and bookseller, so it\r\nwill be well to notice those which he enriched with his paintings and\r\nengravings during twenty years of his life. This is a new aspect of his\r\nwhole career which it is our present purpose to bring into view; for,\r\nwhile Tory was for some time teacher, bookseller, printer, he was always a\r\ndraughtsman and engraver, from the day that he was a man grown.\r\n\r\nBut, first of all, there is a preliminary question to be decided: Was\r\nTory really a painter and engraver? In the first part of this book I\r\nsaid that he was, but I did not furnish proofs of the fact, and none of\r\nthe historians of painting or of engraving have mentioned him in that\r\nconnection. It is advisable therefore, first of all, to demonstrate the\r\naccuracy of my assertion. In order to solve this complicated question more\r\neasily, let us divide it.\r\n\r\nWas Tory a painter?\r\n\r\nThat Tory was a painter-draughtsman, there can be no doubt, for he himself\r\nmakes the assertion in express terms on each page of 'Champ fleury.' For\r\ninstance, we read on folio 3 verso of that work, apropos of the Gallic\r\nHercules:--\r\n\r\n'I saw this same fable in rich painting within the city of Rome near the\r\nSanguine tower, not far from the Church of Saint Louis, ... and the better\r\nto keep the thing in my eye, I made this drawing....'\r\n\r\nIn the collection of verses written by him on the occasion of the death of\r\nhis daughter Agnes, Tory makes her speak thus from the urn wherein she is\r\nsupposed to repose:--\r\n\r\n    MONITOR.\r\n\r\n    Who made for you this urn, set with brilliant gems?\r\n\r\n    AGNES.\r\n\r\n    Who? My father; famed in this art.\r\n\r\n    MONITOR.\r\n\r\n    Certes, your father is an excellent potter.\r\n\r\n    AGNES.\r\n\r\n    He practises industriously every day the liberal arts.\r\n\r\nThus Geofroy Tory himself informs us in 1523 that he industriously\r\npractised the arts. Now, if this were true, he could not have been\r\nignorant of drawing, which is the first of all the arts. Moreover, it\r\nis plain that in those days an engraver (and we shall prove in a moment\r\nthat Tory was one) could not fail to be a draughtsman. The artist was\r\nat that time an all-round workman, embracing all the special branches\r\nof his profession: painting, drawing, engraving, he took a hand at them\r\nall. Not until it became vulgarized, until it became a trade, was art\r\nsubdivided--and greatly to its prejudice. In truth, one cannot but realize\r\nall that there is to be desired in the work of those mercenaries of the\r\nengraver's art, who, having no knowledge of the first elements of drawing,\r\nare bidden to reproduce, with the aid of the graving tool, lines which\r\nthey do not understand.\r\n\r\nWe can therefore assert that, as a general rule, the engravings found in\r\nTory's books were drawn by him.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all: I believe that we should also attribute to him the\r\nadmirable miniatures[275] that have come down to us of the painter known\r\nby the name of 'Godefroy.' If, indeed, we compare the engravings in Tory's\r\nbooks with the designs of that painter, we readily recognize a similarity\r\nof execution which seems to establish the identity of the two men. This\r\nGodefroy, who signs his works sometimes with the full name, sometimes with\r\na simple G, but always in roman letters,--a noteworthy thing at a time\r\nwhen the gothic was in its most flourishing state,--was no other than\r\nTory, whose baptismal name, as we have seen, was in Latin Godofredus.\r\nWe know how little was thought of family names in the old days. As\r\nlate as the sixteenth century it was no uncommon thing to see persons\r\ndesignated by their baptismal names alone, or, at most, with the name of\r\ntheir native place added. We have seen[276] that the famous painter Jean\r\nPerreal, Tory's master and friend, was little known except by the name of\r\nJean de Paris. Tory himself is called Godefroy the Berrichon (Godofredus\r\nBiturix) in some verses which his friend Gérard de Vercel composed in his\r\npraise in 1512.[277] Even at the close of the sixteenth century our two\r\nleading bibliographers, Antoine du Verdier and La Croix du Maine, who\r\nalso bore geographical names, deemed it proper to adopt no other order\r\nthan that of baptismal names in arranging alphabetically the authors who\r\nare mentioned in their books entitled 'Bibliothèque Françoise.' There is\r\nnothing extraordinary therefore in Tory's signing his first works with a\r\nbaptismal name alone. It is true that that name is slightly different,\r\northographically speaking, from the one that he used later; but it is well\r\nto remember the change that took place about that time in our author's\r\ncustoms. Doubtless he signed 'Godefroy' before he had entirely shaken off\r\nthe yoke of the classical languages,[278] and had adopted the more French\r\nform 'Geofroy,' which was about the year 1523.\r\n\r\nThe dates inscribed upon some of Godefroy's paintings, 1519 and 1520,\r\ncoincide perfectly with the known facts of Tory's life: that was the\r\nperiod when, after his second return from Italy, he was fain to utilize\r\nhis talents for his livelihood. I may add that we have several engravings\r\nof that same period signed with a G alone, or with a G within which\r\nappears a small F; others signed with a G surmounted by the\r\ndouble cross, with a small S within; and others signed G. T.,\r\nwhich serve to mark the transition between Tory's use of the simple G and\r\nthe inscription in full of his two names, Geofroy Tory. These two names\r\nappear together in one of the borders of his Hours of 1524-1525 [the\r\nborder which is to be found on p. 105].\r\n\r\nWhatever the fact may be, we propose to give here, by way of memorandum,\r\nat least a brief list of the works of the painter Godefroy, referring the\r\nreader for fuller information to the interesting article which M. Léon de\r\nLaborde has published upon this subject in the 'Renaissance des Arts,'\r\nvol. i. pp. 891-913, and, later, in the 'Revue Universelle des Arts,' no.\r\n1 (1855), which article we reproduce below with the author's consent.\r\n\r\nThe only manuscripts known to contain drawings of this artist are 'Les\r\nCommentaires de César,' in three small quarto volumes; and 'Les Triomphes\r\nde Petrarque,' in one small octavo volume--all written in French and bound\r\nin vellum.\r\n\r\nThe first-named work is not, as one might suppose from its title, a\r\ntranslation of the famous work of the conqueror of Gaul, but a commentary\r\nthereon in the form of a dialogue between Cæsar and François I, to whom\r\nthe book is dedicated. The first volume is now in the British Museum at\r\nLondon, the second in the Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris, and the third\r\nin the collection of M. le Duc d'Aumale. All the miniatures in the first\r\nvolume, and there is a great number of them, are signed with a G; some\r\nbear the date 1519. The same is true of the second volume. One of the\r\nminiatures in the third volume is signed in full, 'Godefroy' (folio 52);\r\nseveral others, signed G only, are dated 1520.\r\n\r\nAs for the 'Triumphs' of Petrarch, which is in the Bibliothèque de\r\nl'Arsenal, the miniatures bear no dates, but they are all signed with a\r\nG, and one has in addition the full name, 'Godefroy.' In the two works\r\nthe drawings have the same general appearance; they are distinguished\r\nfrom those of the professional miniaturists by a very marked sobriety\r\nof colouring. They are noticeable, moreover, by reason of a delicacy\r\nof execution and, at the same time, a sharpness of outline which can\r\nhave come from no other hand than that of an engraver; now the engraver\r\ncan have been no other than Tory, whose shields and even his antique\r\narabesques we find in these designs.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these two works, of which the name and the _style_ of the\r\nartist seem to me to permit their being attributed to Tory, I will mention\r\nhere several others, of a somewhat later date, which likewise various\r\ncircumstances make it possible to attribute to him.\r\n\r\nThe first is a translation of the first three books of Diodorus Siculus,\r\nby Antoine Macault. This superb manuscript, which was in the library of\r\nM. Firmin Didot _père_ in 1810, is to-day buried in one of the private\r\nlibraries of England. A description will be found on pp. 166-168. It is\r\ntrue that there is nothing about it to suggest Tory, but the style of the\r\npainting and of the engraving (the book was printed by Tory's widow in\r\n1535) leaves no doubt as to his authorship. The second is a collection of\r\nportraits of the kings of France, by Jean du Tillet, the manuscript of\r\nwhich, presented by the author to Charles IX, is still preserved in the\r\nBibliothèque du Roi. See the description of this priceless manuscript, and\r\nof several others preserved in the same collection.[279]\r\n\r\nWe come now to the second question:--Was Tory an engraver?\r\n\r\nNeither Zani nor Papillon mentions him as such; nevertheless, there is\r\none presumption in his favour. La Croix du Maine, who was almost his\r\ncontemporary, tells us[280], without going into details, it is true,\r\nthat Tory was known by the name 'maître au Pot Cassé'; others have said\r\nthat he perfected Josse Bade's letters.[281] M. Renouvier has recently\r\nwritten[282] that Tory possessed the rare faculty of using the 'eschoppe'\r\n[graver] as well as the pen. 'Le Champ fleury,' he says, 'is a treatise\r\non æsthetics such as none but an engraver of types could conceive.' What\r\nM. Renouvier conjectured, I assert, with no fear of being contradicted\r\nby the facts. To be sure, Tory did not anywhere state categorically that\r\nhe was an engraver; but he gave it to be understood indirectly. For\r\nexample, he tells us that, among the fancies that came to his mind on the\r\n6th of January, 1523, and resulted in the composition of 'Champ fleury,'\r\nhe remembered 'a letter of ancient form,' which he had 'not long since\r\nmade for the house of my lord the treasurer of the wars, maistre Jehan\r\nGroslier, counsellor and secretary to the king our sire.'[283] What was\r\nthis ancient letter made for the famous bibliophile Grolier, if not the\r\nbasis of the beautiful roman characters which were used in that scholar's\r\nestablishment to decorate his books, and to stamp upon them, in gold, this\r\nexcellent device, among others, 'Ioannis Grolierii et Amicorum?'[284]\r\n\r\nAgain, all the authorities agree that Claude Garamond was a pupil of\r\nTory. Now, what could he have learned from his master, if not the art of\r\nengraving types,--he who did nothing else in his whole life?\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it is impossible to doubt that Tory engraved types when one\r\nruns through his 'Champ fleury.' Note especially what he says on folio 34\r\nrecto, where, having given a drawing of a capital A reversed, he explains\r\nit in the technical terms of the engraver.\r\n\r\n'This,' he says, 'is done to help and give hints to goldsmiths and\r\nengravers, who, with their burin, graver, or other tool, engrave and cut\r\nan ancient letter reversed [à l'envers], or, as we say, to the left, so\r\nthat it may appear to the right when it is printed and placed in its\r\nproper aspect. I have purposely made it white, and its background black,\r\nthe opposite of the one that is drawn to the right, so that no one may\r\nbe misled. For, as I have said, I have seen and do see many persons who\r\nare misled. Before the letter to be printed is finished, it is made twice\r\nreversed and twice to the right. In the first of the reversed there are\r\nthe punches[285] of steel, in which the letter is wholly left-handed. The\r\nmatrices have the letter to the right. The letter then cast is, as I have\r\nsaid of the punches, left-handed. Then finally on the printed paper the\r\nwhole appears to the right, and in its proper aspect to be read currently.\r\nI had forgotten to say that the broad leg of the A is one tenth of its\r\nsquare in width, and the other leg one third as wide. The transverse limb\r\nshould be three fourths as wide as the broad leg, as you may see by the\r\ndrawings herewith made and duly proportioned.'\r\n\r\nAfter this, and knowing as we do the relations between Geofroy Tory and\r\nthe Estienne family, it will not be deemed extraordinary that I attribute\r\nto our artist the italic letters of Simon de Colines, engraved about 1525,\r\nand the roman and italic letters of Robert Estienne, engraved a little\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nBut Tory not only engraved letters, that is to say, punches on steel,\r\nas some authors have stated: he signalized himself above all by his\r\nengravings on wood, and he illustrated almost all the books of his time,\r\nwhich fact is almost wholly unknown. I shall be asked, doubtless, upon\r\nwhat evidence my opinion is based. It is this: In the license to print\r\nthe book of Hours, granted to Tory by François I on September 23, 1524,\r\nwe read:[286] 'Our dear and well-beloved maistre Geofroy Tory ... hath\r\nnow caused it to be made known and shown unto us that _he hath of late\r\nmade_ and caused to be made certain pictures and vignettes \"à l'antique,\"\r\nand likewise certain others, \"à la moderne,\" to the end that the same may\r\nbe printed and made use of in divers books of Hours, whereupon he hath\r\nemployed himself a very long time, and hath made divers great expenditures\r\nand outlays.' Evidently the words 'he hath made' do not here apply to the\r\ndrawing, but to the engraving of these pictures and vignettes, which he\r\nhad previously drawn. Moreover, Tory himself betrayed his profession of\r\nengraver on wood in a charming vignette which he used as an initial in\r\n'Champ fleury,' and which is reproduced on page 1. For we see therein,\r\nbesides a compass, a square, etc., a pen and several varieties of knives\r\nused in wood-engraving; all of which justifies the remark of M. Renouvier:\r\n'Tory possessed the rare faculty of using the graver as well as the pen.'\r\n\r\nBut, I shall be told, it avails nothing to prove vaguely that Tory\r\ndabbled in wood-engraving, if we can point to no works of his in that\r\nbranch of the art,--for no one has done so hitherto. I propose to try to\r\ngratify the reader's desire, by proving that there is a way to recognize\r\nthe engravings executed by Tory.\r\n\r\nMany persons have already observed that the principal engravings in\r\nTory's books, those which are most individual, as, for example, the\r\nGallic Hercules (reproduced on page 141), and that of the Pot Cassé which\r\naccompanies the description of that emblem in 'Champ fleury' (reproduced\r\non page 21) bear a mark; but this mark they dare not attribute to him,\r\nbecause it is constantly found upon engravings, alone or accompanied by\r\ninitials, for more than a century. M. Robert-Dumesnil, in his interesting\r\nwork entitled 'Le Peintre-Graveur français,' published in the course of\r\nhis article on Woeiriot,[287] who himself used this same mark, a catalogue\r\nof engravings signed with the double cross,--which he calls the cross of\r\nLorraine or of Jerusalem,--extending from 1522 to 1632. He concludes that\r\nthis mark was 'frequently employed in France, as a fictitious signature,\r\non engravings on wood, by artists whose names will probably remain forever\r\nburied in oblivion.'\r\n\r\nTo banish this phantom, which caused M. Renouvier himself to pause on the\r\npathway of truth,[288] it is sufficient to come to close quarters with it.\r\nThis is what I propose to do; but first I must thank M. Robert-Dumesnil\r\nfor having satisfactorily cleared up one important point. Until his book\r\nappeared, almost all the engravings marked with the double cross had been\r\nattributed to Woeiriot; or, rather, the engravings of the latter had\r\nadded to the perplexity of classifiers. By identifying Woeiriot's work,\r\nM. Robert-Dumesnil has simplified the problem considerably. Only a small\r\nnumber of pieces remain to be ascribed to their authors, and as to these\r\nM. Robert-Dumesnil expresses himself thus: 'None of the works executed\r\nprior to Woeiriot's birth and the beginning of his career as an artist can\r\nbe by him; of the others we hasten to say that not one seems to us to have\r\nbeen designed or executed by him.'\r\n\r\nNothing could be clearer. Let us add, to close the discussion, that\r\nWoeiriot did not begin to engrave until long after Tory had ceased, as he\r\nwas barely two years old when Tory died; and, furthermore, that his cross\r\nis almost always accompanied by his initials; sometimes, however, he uses\r\nthe cross alone, but in that case the date prevents confusion. Take, for\r\nexample, the 'Emblesmes et devises chrestiennes composées par damoiselle\r\nGeorgette de Montenay,' the first edition of which was in 1571. It is\r\nimpossible to attribute these engravings to Tory, who died nearly forty\r\nyears earlier.\r\n\r\nThe other artists who used the cross may be divided into three classes,\r\naccording to M. Robert-Dumesnil's book. First, we find the cross alone,\r\nfrom 1522 to 1561; secondly, after a long interval, in 1599, the cross\r\nappears accompanied by the initials I, L, B; and, lastly, a little later,\r\ntwo engravers on copper, named Jean Barra and Claude Rivard, signed their\r\nworks with the cross. I do not include here the double cross discovered by\r\nM. Robert-Dumesnil on the printer's mark of a book dated 1632, because it\r\nis the mark of Gilles Corrozet, engraved a century earlier, as we shall\r\nsee further on.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, then, there are no anonymous works bearing the cross except\r\nthose produced between 1522 and 1561. The only question is whether the\r\nengravings executed between those dates, which bear the cross without\r\ninitials, belong to one or to several artists.\r\n\r\nI will, first of all, call attention to the fact that this interval\r\nembraces only forty years, and that there is no reason to attribute to\r\nseveral contemporaneous and anonymous artists a very peculiar mark which\r\na single artist might have used during an even longer time. But this is\r\nnot all: this interval can be reduced by several years; for the examples\r\nalleged to be subsequent to 1557, mentioned by M. Robert-Dumesnil, bear\r\nno date; they appear, it is true, in books printed after that year, but\r\nthey were engraved earlier, as I shall prove in due time. Blocks are not\r\nephemeral objects; like type, they can be used indefinitely, and their use\r\nat a certain date does not prove that they had been made within a short\r\ntime. We have just cited one--Gilles Corrozet's mark--which, simply by\r\nlack of use, it was possible to reproduce in books for more than a century.\r\n\r\nWhat surprises me is not that M. Robert-Dumesnil has seen engravings with\r\nthe cross printed in 1561, but that he has found none of a later date,\r\nwhich would have allowed him to fill up the gap that he has left between\r\nthe anonymous artist of the cross alone and him who accompanied it with\r\nthe letters I, L, B; he might have discovered the beautiful illustration\r\nof the Missal of 1539, which is described hereafter, in books of the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Indeed, we find wood engravings of\r\nthe sixteenth century, bearing the double cross, in a book published at\r\nTroyes in 1850!\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I am surprised that M. Robert-Dumesnil found no\r\nengravings with the cross, accompanied by initials, of a date much\r\nearlier than 1599, for I myself have seen some that were contemporaneous\r\nwith Tory. In fact, the Bibliothèque Nationale possesses a book of Hours\r\naccording to the use of Paris, printed in that city in 1548, by Jean de\r\nBrye's widow, in which all the engravings are marked with the cross and\r\nthe initials L, R. It is an octavo volume, printed in gothic type, and\r\nin red and black. An interesting fact to be noted here is that these\r\nengravings are improved copies of other unsigned engravings belonging\r\nto the printer Thielman Kerver,[289] and printed in a large number of\r\nbooks issued by him or his widow, Iolande Bonhomme, at least as early as\r\n1522,[290] and still to be seen in the Paris Missal, published by his\r\nson Jacques in 1559. I have seen also engravings of the artist with the\r\ninitials I, L, B (cited by M. Robert-Dumesnil under the date of 1599), in\r\na book of 1547.\r\n\r\nThese facts do not tend to contradict my proposition; they prove that Tory\r\nfounded a school, and that his pupils adopted his mark (which is nothing\r\nmore than his initial, or, rather, his toret, transferred from the Pot\r\nCassé, of which it was the essential feature, to his engravings), adding\r\nthereto their initials, to distinguish themselves from the master whose\r\nensign they hoisted, and to preserve their own individuality. I shall\r\nrecur to this subject later.\r\n\r\nThe principal reason which prevented M. Renouvier from attributing to\r\nTory, as he was naturally inclined to do, the engravings marked with\r\nthe double cross alone, was the impossibility, in his judgement, of\r\nattributing them all to the same artist. 'M. Robert-Dumesnil,' he says,\r\n'has noted a large number of books of 1522 to 1599, on the title-pages\r\nand plates of which the cross of Lorraine is found. This list might be\r\nincreased, and the items should be carefully compared by whoever would\r\ntry to find on them the mark of a wood-engraving establishment, or of\r\nseveral engravers on wood who worked for the booksellers Pierre Gaudoul,\r\nSimon de Colines, Robert Estienne, Grouleau, Gilles Corrozet, Vincent\r\nSertenas,[291] etc.'\r\n\r\nI have already answered the objection based upon M. Robert-Dumesnil's\r\nbook, which he himself has abandoned with great pleasure, taking a deep\r\ninterest in my discovery.[292] As for what M. Renouvier adds, it does not\r\nrun counter to my suggestion, for I have already mentioned that, after\r\nTory's death, his widow carried on his engraving establishment for several\r\nyears, retaining the same mark. This, doubtless, is the explanation of the\r\ndifferences to be noticed in the works signed with the Lorraine cross;\r\nfor Perrette le Hullin, not being an engraver herself, must have employed\r\ndifferent workmen.\r\n\r\nThis leads me to answer an objection that has been made to my theory. My\r\nattention has been called to the fact that the Lorraine cross appears on\r\nworks anterior to Tory,--such, for example, as the mark of Gauthier Lud,\r\nthe first printer of Saint-Dié in Lorraine. I have no purpose to claim the\r\nLorraine cross for Tory alone. He was not its inventor, nor did it die\r\nwith him; but there is a distinction to be made between an emblem employed\r\nin a general way, and one employed as the special mark of an artist. Not\r\nonly do I not claim for Tory the Lorraine cross surmounting a circle,\r\nwhich appears on the mark of the Lorraine printer, Gauthier Lud,[293] in\r\n1507, but I exclude the Lorraine cross surmounting a large gothic G, found\r\non the title-page of a folio Missal according to the use of the church of\r\nToul, printed at Paris by Wolfgang Hopyl, in 1508.[294] To my mind nothing\r\ncould be more natural than that the Lorraine cross should be used in\r\nLorraine; but that does not prove that an artist at Bourges may not have\r\nadopted it as the mark of his establishment.\r\n\r\nI mention hereafter as one of Tory's first engravings on wood the\r\ntitle-page of a book printed at Meaux in 1522, and I then say that the\r\npreface of that book was dated 'Meldis, anno M. D. XXI.'[295]\r\nM. Brunet makes me say,[296] I cannot imagine why, 'Metis' instead of\r\n'Meldis'; and M. Didot, misled by that statement, says that the book in\r\nquestion was published at Metz,[297] which fact seems to him to explain\r\nthe presence of the Lorraine cross on the title. This shows how an error\r\nmay be appealed to in support of a theory.\r\n\r\nNot only have I not exaggerated the part played by my hero, as authors are\r\nsomewhat in the habit of doing,--on the contrary, I have restricted it as\r\nmuch as possible. Since the publication of my first edition, an attempt\r\nhas been made to prove Tory to be the maker, or, at least, the decorator,\r\nof the beautiful Henri II porcelains, so-called, the subject of a recent\r\npublication of MM. Delange, father and son. M. Didot himself adopted this\r\nopinion,[298] which is based upon a vague similarity, but is completely\r\nrefuted by the date of Tory's death. So far as I am concerned, appearances\r\nare of no consequence, unless they are accompanied by some substantial\r\nevidence; and that is why I have excluded from the list of Tory's works\r\nsome engravings that Messrs. Renouvier and Didot do not hesitate to\r\nattribute to him because of certain similarities, but which do not bear\r\nhis mark. It is that mark which has served me as a guide in identifying\r\nTory's work. The objection is made, to be sure, that this plan requires\r\nthe attribution to Tory of engravings of very dissimilar styles. Every\r\nplan has its disadvantages; but, all things considered, I prefer one that\r\nhas something to stand upon to one that has nothing. Moreover, it is easy\r\nto explain the different styles of the artist of the Lorraine cross by\r\nreferring to what has often taken place in the careers of other artists.\r\nIn truth, how many painters have we seen change their style of painting\r\nat a certain period of their lives! But there is an even simpler way of\r\nexplaining these dissimilarities in different engravings, namely, by\r\nadmitting with me that the Lorraine cross was the mark of Tory's workshop,\r\nbut that in that workshop there were other artists of very diverse\r\nabilities. In the same way, we see to-day a multitude of engravings signed\r\n'Andrew,' 'Best,' 'Leloir,' to which those artists certainly never put\r\ntheir hands.\r\n\r\nBut let us have done with argument and come to the facts: they will prove\r\nmore conclusively than any number of dissertations the truth of our\r\nstatement concerning Tory; they will prove, in fact, that all the works\r\nsigned by the cross alone were engraved during that artist's lifetime, or\r\nin the establishment which he founded and which his widow retained until\r\nabout 1556.\r\n\r\nTo make the demonstration clearer, I will divide what I still have to\r\nsay into three sections. In the first I will include all the manuscripts\r\nthe decoration of which can be attributed to Tory; in the second I will\r\ndescribe all the engravings marked with the Lorraine cross that are known\r\nto me, arranging them in chronological order; and in the third I will\r\nmention such marks of printer-booksellers bearing the aforesaid cross, as\r\nI have been able to discover. As it is impossible for me to follow the\r\nchronological order in this last category, I have adopted the alphabetical\r\norder, which will enable one to find at once such of these marks as are\r\nmentioned in the second section.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 275: [It should be borne in mind that the word _miniature_ as\r\nused in this book has not its ordinary present-day signification; it means\r\nhere any ornamented or coloured design of small dimensions.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 276: [See supra, p. 23, and note 1.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 277: [See supra, p. 71.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 278: [See supra, p. 9.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 279: Infra, pp. 169-171.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 280: _Bibliothèque françoise_, article 'Geufroy Tory.'

MANUSCRIPTS DECORATED WITH MINIATURES BY TORY.\r\n\r\n1. COMMENTAIRES DE CÉSAR.\r\n\r\n2. TRIOMPHES DE PÉTRARQUE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a description of these two manuscripts[299] I cannot do better than\r\ntranscribe in this place the interesting work of Comte Léon de Laborde.\r\nI print this work just as it was published several years ago, having no\r\nauthority to modify it. But I think that I may venture to say that if\r\nit had been prepared since the publication of my book on Tory, it would\r\ncontain a judgement in his favour. That seems to me to be the result of\r\nmy conversations with M. de Laborde. My friend M. Jules Renouvier, whose\r\ndeath is so deeply to be deplored, and in whose company I examined the\r\nvolume of the 'Commentaires' in the Bibliothèque Nationale, was entirely\r\nof my opinion. He spoke of the manuscript in question in these terms in a\r\ncritical review of the first edition of my book on Tory, printed in the\r\n'Revue Universelle des Arts' for September, 1857 (vol. v, no. 6, p. 511):--\r\n\r\n'The point that we knew least about was Tory's début in the career of an\r\nartist. It was most brilliant if we agree with M. Bernard that he was\r\nthe author of the miniatures found in two well-known manuscripts, the\r\n\"Commentaires de César\" in three volumes and the \"Triomphes de Pétrarque,\"\r\nin which we find the signatures \"G,\" and \"Godefroy,\" and the dates 1519\r\nand 1520. M. de Laborde has recently described them with all the care that\r\nthey deserve, without discovering who this Godefroy was. He was no other\r\nthan Geofroy Tory, says M. Bernard, and this opinion is plausible; for, if\r\nthe subsequent work of the engraver on wood does not fulfil the promise\r\nof the miniaturist, the drawing is governed by identical characteristics,\r\nand the similarity of style is striking, especially when we consider\r\nthe engravings that are nearest in point of time, as those of \"Champ\r\nfleury,\" dated 1526. Considered from this point of view, Geofroy Tory is\r\nthe most precocious of the artists of the Renaissance: before the masters\r\nof Fontainebleau, he introduced the stately, graceful and individualized\r\nfigures, which aroused enthusiasm in the time of François I, to which\r\nItaly lent much of her style, and Germany a little of her force, but which\r\nwere more thoroughly French than is generally admitted. It is well known,\r\nmoreover, that these miniatures were originally, even in the \"camaieu\"\r\nprocess, heightened in effect by chatoyant tones, with subtleties of\r\ndrawing which denote a hand more apt to handle the pencil than the brush,\r\nand altogether adapted to the tools of the engraver. The draughtsman loses\r\na part of his distinction in passing from a privileged to a commonplace\r\nform of art; but so the progress of art willed.'\r\n\r\nThe work of M. Léon de Laborde follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\nGODEFROY, PAINTER TO FRANÇOIS I.\r\n\r\nGodefroy has left us, in four small volumes,--the first three entitled\r\n'Commentaires de César,' the fourth 'Triomphes de Pétrarque'--the proof of\r\na fruitful imagination, of a talent in portrait-painting no less flexible\r\nthan varied, and of a superiority original with himself, and thoroughly\r\nFrench,--a very unusual combination of the qualities peculiar to our\r\nschool prior to the formation of the school of Fontainebleau, and of the\r\nqualities--or, to speak more accurately, the defects--which that colony of\r\nforeign artists was soon to introduce in our midst.\r\n\r\nThese four volumes, after divers vicissitudes, repose at last, at the end\r\nof their journeyings and safe from the risk of destruction, the first in\r\nthe British Museum at London, the second in the Bibliothèque Nationale\r\nat Paris, the third in the collection of H. R. H. the Duc d'Aumale, and\r\nthe fourth in the Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal. I will describe first the\r\n'Commentaires de César,' a beautiful manuscript, the three volumes of\r\nwhich I have had before me one by one. There are in this work three things\r\nworthy of remark, to which I shall direct the reader's attention for a\r\nbrief space. First, the composition of the work; second, the painting of\r\nthe decorations; and lastly, the portraits.\r\n\r\nThe author, a native of Flanders or Artois, transplanted to the Court\r\nof France, displays no overplus of wit or imagination. He supposes that\r\nKing François I, in one of his excursions, or while hunting, meets\r\nJulius Cæsar, and that they converse. The subject of their dialogue is\r\nthe Gallic war; it is a sort of commentary on Cæsar's Commentaries, with\r\ntransparent allusions to the events of the reign of François I. It\r\nis in these allusions that we detect the author's predilection for the\r\nBelgæ,[300] with whose country he is familiar, and particularly for the\r\ncity of Tournay,[301] which may well have been his native place. I do\r\nnot propose to draw any inference from his hatred of the English[302];\r\nalthough more violent in our northern provinces than elsewhere, that\r\nsentiment was then universal in France. It would seem, at least so far as\r\nthe implements of war are concerned, that the painter who was employed to\r\nembellish the manuscript worked under the author's direction. We find in\r\nseveral places remarks like this: 'The tower is sufficiently described by\r\nthe engines that I have caused to be drawn herein.'\r\n\r\nFor the rest, we feel that we have to do with a conscientious author;\r\nand simply by the extracts which follow, we may recognize the man who is\r\nuncertain and hesitates, the student who leaves every one in possession of\r\nhis rights and who confides his doubts to the reader. On the eighth leaf\r\nof volume two he has instructed Godefroy, the painter, to reproduce an\r\nantique medallion; he writes in the margin: 'I fear that it is not that\r\nCassius who was a conspirator in the death of Cæsar, for his name was\r\nCaius Cassius, and I find on the medallion Quintus Cassius.' As to one of\r\nthe pictures of machines of war he makes this comment: 'Certain pictures\r\nof implements of war, as they are portrayed by Frère Jocunde in book x\r\nof Vitruvius.' Beside another, he says: 'I am not the inventor of the\r\nmachines which follow, for I found them in a book that I secured long ago\r\nat Chastellerault, at the Lyon d'or.'\r\n\r\nTo this curious piece of information let us add another,[303] which tells\r\nus that the author of the book was in relations with an artist of Blois,\r\na clock-maker and inventive genius: 'The two pictures that follow [two\r\nwarlike machines] were taken from a book that Julian, clock-maker at\r\nBloys, gave me.--Julian is a man of great wit and knows many things.'\r\n\r\nA passage on folio xxii verso of the second volume seems to prove that the\r\nmanuscript was written during the years 1519 and 1520: 'By the map [a map\r\nof Gaul] placed at the beginning of the translation of the first book made\r\nat Saint Germain en Laye in the month of April in the year one thousand\r\nfive hundred nineteen, you will see clearly who the Belgæ are.'\r\n\r\nAfter the author, it is proper to speak of the calligrapher who wrote\r\nthe manuscript; but there is nothing to be said save that it is in a\r\nfair hand. The painter Godefroy deserves more consideration and careful\r\nattention. Let us not forgot that we are dealing with a perfectly\r\nwell-fixed time, limited to the years 1519 and 1520; let us, at the same\r\ntime, recall the great national movement in art in France from 1450 to\r\n1500, the Italian campaigns, the arrival of artists and objects of art\r\nfrom Italy during the reigns of Charles VIII and Louis XII, and lastly,\r\nand above all, the sojourn in France of the two great Italian masters,\r\nLeonardo da Vinci and Andrea del Sarto, from 1515 to 1518. Born and\r\ntrained amid such influences, a French painter undertakes to decorate a\r\nmanuscript for King François I. What does he do to satisfy the prevailing\r\ntaste, the fashion, without denying his past? He divides his talent into\r\ntwo parts,[304] and devotes one, the French part, to the portraits, the\r\nother, the Italian imitation, to the decorations; in both he gives proof\r\nof abundant talent. In the one case, an exact, shrewd observer, he paints\r\nfaces by faithfully reproducing their individual traits; in the other,\r\nfertile, never the same, abounding in resources in the ensemble and the\r\ndetails of his compositions, he is the pupil of Leonardo da Vinci, with\r\nsuggestions of Mantegna and the artists of the first Italian Renaissance\r\nin the proportion of the figures, in the ungracefulness of the attitudes,\r\nand in the types of the heads.\r\n\r\nFrom this period, from these influences, and not from Primaticcio, who\r\nwas himself subjected to them, dates the Fontainebleau school. It was\r\nadapted to the figure and the type of beauty of Diana de Poitiers; she\r\nencouraged it; but, I say again, it was formed, it was current, before\r\nthe reign of the mistress of Henri II and before the painter who is its\r\nmost characteristic expression. If we seek to discover what method of\r\nexecution was adopted by Godefroy, we see that his portraits are charming\r\nminiatures, comparable with the finest examples that we have of French\r\nminiature-painting; as for the drawings,[305] there are some that are\r\nalmost grisailles, almost coloured--a mongrel and conventional scheme,\r\nof very doubtful taste. The painter drew his whole subject with the pen,\r\nwith a sureness of touch which, it must be said, has no parallel in such\r\nmicroscopical dimensions, especially with respect to the faces and the\r\nlandscapes; then he laid in the general outline, with the brush and\r\nwith sepia, in flat tones, rather lacking in life. Thus far he did not\r\ndepart from the canons of art; but he added coloured costumes, suits of\r\narmour, gilded trappings, and a multitude of details which flutter about\r\nin his grisaille and depart from nature in a most extraordinary way. I\r\nhave said that his figures are reminiscences of Italian works. We find\r\namong them Donatellesque forms, profiles perdus, and bold gestures that\r\nrecall Mantegna, Perugino-like graceful attitudes and ways of carrying\r\nthe head, and, in spite of everything, a French background, and points\r\nof resemblance to Holbein, which might be taken to signify that Godefroy\r\nhad never seen Italy. Our national Renaissance had made such progress\r\nin nearly a century that our artists needed only a few drawings, a few\r\nengravings, with the impulsion given by Leonardo da Vinci and Andrea del\r\nSarto, to enter that Italian current. It may be that our compatriot,\r\nlike Holbein, was subjected to this influence from afar, at second hand,\r\nwithout having crossed the mountains.\r\n\r\n_First volume._[306]--The book opens with a map of Gaul, and we read\r\non the verso of the first leaf the following passage, written within\r\na cartouche: 'Françoys, by the grace of God, King of France, a second\r\nCæsar, vanquisher and subduer of the Souycez [Swiss], on the last day\r\nof April, one month after the birth of his second son, in his park of\r\nSainct-Germain-en-Laye, fell in with Julius Cæsar and questioned him\r\nshrewdly concerning the contents of the first book of the Commentaries.'\r\nIn another cartouche is a passage of which we need transcribe no more\r\nthan the first words: 'Cæsar, first subjugator of the Helvecez [Helvetii,\r\nSwiss], graciously made reply to him,' etc.\r\n\r\nOn the third leaf Godefroy has painted the portrait of François I, head\r\nand shoulders alone, in a medallion. He wears his usual costume and the\r\ncap, without a feather, adorned with a banner. His features and his whole\r\ncountenance are idealized--they are a little stiff and sharp; the artist\r\nhas sought to produce an ideal antique head. The first miniature, on\r\nthe verso of the fifth leaf, bears the date 1519, with no monogram; the\r\nothers--folios 9, 13, 17, 21, 23, 31, 33, 36, 43, 53, 60, and so on to\r\nthe end--are signed with a G, and dated the same year. On the miniature\r\npainted on the recto of folio 53, the initial of the artist's name is\r\ntraced on the trunk of a tree from which hangs a small cartouche with the\r\nwords, 'Besanson, 1519.' To be sure, the corresponding passage in the text\r\nrequires that the miniature in question should represent that venerable\r\ncity, but a certain precision in the details, and a sort of predilection\r\nmanifested in the care bestowed upon the execution, lead me to believe\r\nthat the view was painted after nature, and that Godefroy was attached to\r\nthat city by some bond.\r\n\r\nI have already spoken of the special characteristics of these miniatures,\r\nand I will mention here only the one on folio 23, which represents the\r\nbuilding of a bridge over the Saône. In the foreground we see figures\r\nreminiscent of the painter Mantegna in their activity, their vigour, and\r\na certain almost antique grace. The artist has retained the long pointed\r\nshoes to mark the Frenchman; this is an ill-timed display of archæological\r\nlearning.\r\n\r\nThe volume, a large octavo, shaped like a notebook, contains 76 leaves,\r\nincluding the map. It is in its original binding of red morocco, with\r\nornaments of wreaths of fleurs-de-lis, stamped with small tools. One can\r\nsee the marks of the ribbons which were used to close it and to keep the\r\nvellum from puckering. On the recto of the first leaf, below the map of\r\nGaul, are the words: 'Bibliothecæ Christophori Justelli.' This note,\r\nwhile it establishes the antiquity of the manuscript, also explains its\r\nemigration to England. Christophe Justel, Councillor and Secretary to the\r\nKing, died at Paris in 1649, at the age of seventy, leaving to his son,\r\ntogether with the taste for study, a valuable collection of books and\r\nmanuscripts. Among the latter was this first volume of the 'Commentaires\r\nde César.' Henri Justel succeeded his father in the office of Secretary to\r\nthe King; also in his literary studies and in the liberality with which\r\nhis library and house were thrown open to scholars. The letters of all\r\nthe learned men of the time bear witness to his hospitality offered to\r\nlearning.\r\n\r\nHe published at Paris, in 1661, the 'Bibliotheca juris canonici veteris\r\nex antiquis codd. mss. bibliothecæ Christophori Justelli,' in two folio\r\nvolumes, and he seemed destined to pursue in peace his erudite career. But\r\nthe tempest called the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes was preceded,\r\nfor far-seeing Protestants, by premonitory signs which were enough for\r\nHenri Justel. He packed up his books and crossed to England, where he was\r\nappointed Librarian to the King--an office which he held until his death\r\nin 1698. The manuscript of the 'Commentaires' was probably purchased\r\nat the sale of his library by Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford. The Lord\r\nTreasurer of England (1661-1724) found consolation for the ingratitude of\r\nmen in forming that magnificent collection, which retains the name of the\r\nHarleian Collection in the British Museum.\r\n\r\nOur manuscript, however, reached that haven only with the second part of\r\nRobert Harley's books and manuscripts, in 1754.\r\n\r\n_Second Volume._[307]--The first miniature represents François I on\r\nhorseback, in hunting costume, wearing the chapeau with plumes. The King\r\nis urging his horse to the right. Above his head a crowned F in gold\r\nstands out against the blue background of a shield. This was a device for\r\ndisclosing his identity to those who were not struck by the likeness. In\r\nthe middle distance is a huntsman, galloping in the same direction as the\r\nKing and blowing his horn. Over his head floats a banderole, bearing the\r\nname 'PEROT.'[308] On a stone between the legs of the King's\r\nhorse is the initial letter of the artist's name; and beneath, in a frame\r\n(separated, however, by a running dog), the date 1519. The border is of\r\nthe utmost grace of design, and leaves room for a few words of the text,\r\nwhich begins thus:--\r\n\r\n'Françoys, by the grace of God King of France, desiring to exercise his\r\nlusty youth by violent labour, early in the month of August in the year\r\none thousand five hundred nineteen, went forth to course the stag in the\r\nforest of Byevre, and gave order that on that day those dogs should course\r\nwhich he had chosen to lead the pack, because they are surer than the\r\nothers. Gaillart was of the number, as was Gallehault, and pretty Rameau.\r\nArbault, Gerfault, and Billehault went in their company.\r\n\r\n'The King was following the stag very close and was riding at full speed\r\nwhen he fell in with the chaste Diana. The King was overcome with joy, and\r\nhaving forgotten his quarry, he was all amazed that the vision vanished\r\nand he remained all alone in deepest thought. But soon after he saw beside\r\nhim an ancient man of venerable aspect. He knew upon hearing him speak\r\nthat it was his friend Julius Cæsar, whom he had met in like manner, only\r\nthree months before, in his park at Sainte-Germain-en-Laye.'\r\n\r\nThereupon they enter into conversation upon Cæsar's campaigns.\r\n\r\nGodefroy's plates, almost all of which are signed with a G and dated 1519,\r\nare on these leaves: 2 verso, 3 verso, 4 verso, 5 verso, 7 verso, 9 verso,\r\n20 recto, 22 verso, 28 recto, 33 verso, 34 verso, 36 verso, 37 verso, 43\r\nrecto, 46 verso, 48 verso, 59 verso, 62 verso, 78 verso, 90 recto.\r\n\r\nThe medallions, which are copied from the antique, are admirably executed\r\nin gold on a blue ground, the models being delicately outlined in sepia.\r\nThey are on leaves 6 verso, 8 recto, 9 verso, 10 verso, 11 recto and\r\nverso, 12 recto and verso, 13 recto and verso.\r\n\r\nWarlike machines, copied from other drawings, and consequently lacking the\r\nlife imparted by the representation of real objects, fill leaves 39 recto\r\nand verso, 40 recto and verso, 41 recto, 91 recto and verso, 92 recto and\r\nverso, 93 recto and verso, 94 recto.\r\n\r\nLastly, the portraits may be found on the leaves which I am now about to\r\nenumerate. I will add nothing to what I have said of their perfection,\r\ngenerally speaking, reserving my comments for the points of interest\r\nsuggested by the manuscript itself. These portraits, as one might have\r\nanticipated, and as is proved by leaf 52 most directly, are copies of\r\noriginals which antedate the manuscript. They are painted in miniature,\r\nsurrounded by three circles of black and gold; the whole medallion is\r\nfifty-two millimeters in diameter, the miniature forty.\r\n\r\nLeaf 25 verso: Quintus Pedius. Such is the title given by the scribe;\r\nbut a different hand has written in the margin, in cursive characters:\r\n'Le grand maistre de Boissy, aged 41 years.' I am inclined to see in\r\nthese marginal annotations the hand of the author rather than that of the\r\nartist. This portrait is three-quarters full, turned to the left, with\r\na cap on its head, the hair in a net, a collar of some order around the\r\nneck, face tranquil, expression shrewd.\r\n\r\nLeaf 35 recto: Le Fiable Divitiacus Dautun. ('Admiral de Boissy, seigneur\r\nde Bonivet, aged 34 years.') Three-quarters full, turned to the right.\r\n\r\nLeaf 36: Quintus Titurius Sabinus. ('Odet de Foues, Sieur de Lautrec, aged\r\n41 years.') Three-quarters full, turned to the left.\r\n\r\nLeaf 42: Iccius. ('Le mareschal de Chabanes, seigneur de la Palice, aged\r\n57 years.') Three-quarters full, turned to the left, expression slightly\r\nhaughty.\r\n\r\nLeaf 52: Lucius Aruculeius Cotta. ('Anne de Montmorency, aged 22 years,\r\nafterwards connestable de France.')\r\n\r\nLeaf 73: Publius Sextius Baculus. ('Le mareschal de Fleuranges, son\r\nof Robert de la Marche, first seigneur de Sedan, aged 24 years.')\r\nThree-quarters full, turned to the left.\r\n\r\nLeaf 76 verso: Publius Crassus. ('Le sieur de Tournon who was killed at\r\nthe battle of Pavia, aged 36 years.') Three-quarters full, turned to the\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nOn the verso of leaf 89 we find these words: 'Thus Cæsar made an end of\r\nspeaking and forthwith disappeared. The radiant Diana, who knew the paths\r\nof the forest of Bièvre, and of all time was privy to and understood\r\nthe laws of the chase, remounted, and by so straight a course led the\r\nKing, who had lost the dogs, that within a few hours, near the forest of\r\nFontainebleau, he saw them hunting better than before. And he was the\r\nfirst of all at the death of the stag, but he had with him only pretty\r\nArbault and the beautiful Greffière, for Diana and Aurora had left him and\r\nhad gone their ways.'\r\n\r\nThe two dogs are represented in the miniature; they are attacking the\r\nstag, while the King makes ready to stab him.\r\n\r\nThis volume, containing 98 leaves, is bound in black morocco, which\r\nhas grown rusty; it bears these words stamped in the leather: 'Tomus\r\nSecundus.' It is catalogued in the Supplément Français, as no. 1328.\r\nIts history, as told among the habitués of the Bibliothèque Nationale,\r\nis as follows: M. Van-Praët appeared at the Conservatoire one day\r\nwith an exultant air; he had this fascinating manuscript in his hand,\r\nand announced that he had purchased it for the Bibliothèque for 1200\r\nfrancs. He expected to gladden the hearts of his comrades, to call forth\r\nexpressions of gratitude; far from it; on the contrary, they found fault\r\nboth with that method of purchasing, without authority, and with the price\r\nthat he had paid. M. Van-Praët made haste to banish the scruples of his\r\ninflexible directors, and to put an end to the unpleasant discussion that\r\nwas beginning, by declaring that the purchase had been made for himself\r\nand not for the Bibliothèque; then, when the meeting was adjourned, he\r\nhastened to his friends the brothers Debure, and, with a bursting heart,\r\ntold them of his misadventure. They appreciated Van-Praët's regrets too\r\nthoroughly to try to calm them; but they knew also that he was not rich\r\nenough to keep the manuscript, and they bought for their own little\r\ncollection, at the price that he had paid, that charming product of French\r\nart, still bleeding from the reception that it had met with at the hands\r\nof the great so-called 'national' collection. Years and years had passed\r\nsince this strange performance, when, in 1852, a small package was brought\r\nto M. Naudet, with the information that M. Debure, by his last will, had\r\nordered that this manuscript, embellished with paintings by Godefroy,\r\nwhich had been purchased for the Bibliothèque and spurned by it, should be\r\nrestored to it as its property.\r\n\r\nOne does not know which to admire more in this testamentary disposition\r\nof the famous bookseller--the keenness of his irony or the nobility\r\nof his act. Without exerting itself overmuch to decide that point the\r\nConservatoire of the Bibliothèque Impériale welcomed the prodigal child\r\nand deposited it in the Supplément Français. But, with a lingering remnant\r\nof spite, its light was hidden under the bushel of 'la réserve'; which is\r\none way of preventing people from having access to it with the facility\r\nwhich assists investigations, under the protection of that liberality\r\nwhich is one of our claims to honour among foreign nations, and which the\r\ngovernment of the Bibliothèque should have preserved, even at the price of\r\nthe inconvenience that it might have caused.\r\n\r\n_Third Volume._[309]--Original binding, with the title: 'Cæsaris liber\r\ntertius.' The text begins thus:--\r\n\r\n'On the twenty-seventh day of February, one thousand five hundred XX, the\r\nKing being in his park of Congnac, seeing that the splendour of his entry\r\nwas like to be marred by the inclemency of the weather, took shelter in\r\nthe house of the labyrinth, having with him monsieur l'Admiral and the\r\nyoung and discreet Sieur de la Rochepot. At the entrance to the lower room\r\nhe feels and hears so violent a wind that it seems to him \"quam spiritu\r\nvehementi\" the lofty trees fall to the earth as on Friday the ninth day of\r\nMarch one thousand VᶜᶜXX in divers places about Paris.'\r\n\r\nThe result of all this uproar is the appearance of Julius Cæsar. François\r\nI questions him as to what he did after pacifying Gaul. Whereupon Cæsar\r\nreplies:--\r\n\r\n'I tell you that, after divers victories won by me, so high an opinion\r\nof me and so great renown were spread among the barbarian peoples, that\r\nambassadors were sent to me by the nations beyond the Rhine, who in the\r\nname of their cities promised to give hostages to me and to obey my\r\ncommands. But, for that I was in haste to go thence, I bade them return to\r\nme in the summer season. Thereafter I led my legions to winter quarters\r\nin the land of Touraine and in the duchy of Madame your mother. And that\r\ndone, I went hence to Italy.'\r\n\r\nThis volume is supplied with two maps: one, of Aquitaine, is at the\r\nbeginning, the other, of Bretagne, at the end of the volume, which\r\ncontains also no less than twelve large miniatures. The King, in hunting\r\ncostume, figures again and again in them. The execution is as careful, and\r\nthe paintings of the same type, as in the two earlier volumes. All the\r\nminiatures and the maps are signed with a G, and some of them are dated\r\n1520. On folio 52, the painter's name is written in full: 'Godefroy.'\r\n\r\nThe former owner of this fine manuscript writes to me: 'I cannot furnish\r\nyou with any interesting information concerning the manuscript of the\r\n\"Commentaires de César.\" It was given to me, only the slightest importance\r\nbeing attached to the gift, by a resident of Tours, who owned no books,\r\nand who had kept it for forty years in his closet. To tell you how it\r\ncame into my hands would be the more difficult because that person has\r\nlong been dead. The volume was delivered to me in very bad condition. I\r\nemployed Duru to repair the back and to rebind it, leaving intact the\r\ncovers, which were of the original sixteenth-century binding. A small\r\nengraving, which resembled niello-work, but was recognized as the work of\r\nÉtienne de Laulne, an engraver of Orléans, was at the beginning of the\r\nbook.'\r\n\r\nObliged, in 1850, by circumstances which it is needless to detail,\r\nalthough they were to his honour, to part with this precious volume,\r\nits owner sent it to Paris, to M. Techener, for sale on commission. He\r\nwanted 2000 francs for it, and first of all the bookseller offered it to\r\nthe Bibliothèque Nationale. The Conservatoire of that great collection\r\ncould not find that amount in its annual credit of 80,000 francs, and it\r\nrenewed the old joke which had temporarily banished the second volume.\r\nUnfortunately one does not meet every day, to repair its errors, generous\r\nbooksellers like M. Debure, or those who have it in their power to be as\r\ngenerous as he; and M. Techener, who was richer than our rich collection\r\nof books for the purpose of purchasing this manuscript, was not rich\r\nenough to present it to that collection. He advertised it in the 'Bulletin\r\ndu Bibliophile' for 1850 (no. 1222), for 3000 francs. During a whole\r\nyear, artists and curious folk (I was among the latter) were at liberty\r\nto examine it at leisure and to lament the advent of English dealers who\r\nthreatened every moment to take it from us. At last, Monseigneur le Duc\r\nd'Aumale added it to his treasures of printed books and manuscripts,\r\nand, although in England, one may say now that it belongs to France.\r\nIndeed, it may be that M. Debure's example will be followed some day,\r\nand that this third volume will come to join the second on the shelves\r\nof our magnificent department of manuscripts, awaiting the time when the\r\nfortunate result of negotiations with the British Museum shall permit the\r\nconsummation of the work by means of exchanges.[310]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGodefroy's facile talent could not fail to be fruitful of results, and\r\nsome of his works may be found in several collections. The Bibliothèque\r\nde l'Arsenal owns one of them, the 'Triomphes de Pétrarque,' which\r\nseems, in view of the exuberance of the subjects, the exaggeration of\r\nthe artist's defects, and the laxness of execution, to be of later date\r\nthan the 'Commentaires de César'; and, whether because the artist had\r\nvisited Italy, or because, the better to interpret the poet's ideas, he\r\nsought inspiration in Italian works, it is certain that he is less French\r\nin the illustrations of this manuscript than in the others. He is more\r\nperfect, too, in the art of composition, his distances are more accurately\r\nmeasured, his groups are more in harmony with one another; in a word, he\r\ndisplays an inspiration, or resources, altogether new: such, for example,\r\nas the device of cutting off the figures in the foreground at the waist,\r\nby means of rising ground, whereby he is able to give them strongly\r\nproportioned frames without filling up his whole picture.\r\n\r\nI will describe this manuscript briefly. It is a small octavo volume of\r\nten leaves (not including the covers), written on fine parchment. It\r\nis about 10 centimetres in height by 8 in width. It was rebound in the\r\neighteenth century, in lemon-colored morocco.\r\n\r\n'Here followeth the first of the six triumphs of the most illustrious and\r\nvenerable poet Messire Francisque Petrarque: the which is the triumph of\r\nLove and containeth four chapters.'\r\n\r\nChapter I. A miniature painted on pages 2 and 3, which face each other.\r\nIt represents the triumph of Love, with a deal of disorder and somewhat\r\nlicentious details. The G can be seen in the foreground, in the centre of\r\nthe picture, on the ground.\r\n\r\nChapter II. The miniature has been removed.\r\n\r\nChapter III. The miniature occupies the verso of the title of the chapter.\r\nIn the foreground are amorous couples discoursing together, some seated,\r\nsome walking about. The men wear caps with long feathers, as in the\r\nbas-reliefs of the hôtel de Bourgtheroude. The architectural arrangement\r\nin the background is charming. Beside a triumphal arch rises the tower\r\nof love. Flames are darting from all its windows, and meanwhile a long\r\nprocession of women rushes through the door, followed by a Cupid with\r\nbandaged eyes. The artist has painted his initial on the tower.\r\n\r\nChapter IV. In this miniature, Petrarch's face, twice repeated, seems to\r\nbe a reproduction of an original portrait. The G can just be distinguished\r\non a rock in the foreground; it has been effaced.\r\n\r\n'Here followeth the second triumph of Messire Francisque Petrarque, the\r\nwhich is the triumph of Chastity.'\r\n\r\nThe miniature occupies two facing pages, but it forms two distinct\r\npictures. The buildings in the background are arranged in a quasi-Italian\r\nstyle, but are not a reproduction of any known structure. Godefroy has\r\nplaced his G on a tree, at the left, accompanied by three lizards--a\r\ndetail which should not be passed over, for it is repeated several times,\r\nas if the name of those creatures bore some relation to that of the artist.\r\n\r\n'Triumph of Death, the which is the third triumph of Petrarque.'\r\n\r\n[Chapter I.] This miniature is one of the most interesting and best\r\npreserved. Death, grasping his scythe, stands over the body of a young\r\nwoman lying dead on the triumphal chariot. It is, in fact, the Italian\r\ntriumph, as we have it represented in so many works. In this case the\r\nminiature is in duplicate, as well as the painting. The G is at the bottom.\r\n\r\nChapter II. Miniature on a single page: the death of Laura. The young\r\nwoman is lying on the bed of death. She is surrounded by her friends, with\r\npalms in their hands. Above, in the sky, is seen the form of the Virgin.\r\nIt is a very pleasing composition, nearly filling the frame, and the\r\neffect is charming.\r\n\r\nChapter III. Petrarch and Laura are seated in the shade of tall trees, on\r\nthe bank of a pond in which two swans are floating. The same two persons\r\nare seen farther back, twice repeated, and diminishing in size according\r\nto the distance. An architectural structure, decidedly Italian in type,\r\ncloses the view at the back. The G is painted on a stone at the feet of\r\nPetrarch and Laura. Evidently Godefroy had studied several portraits of\r\nthe two, and he copies them with some success in their various attitudes.\r\nThe trees are done so skilfully that one might well believe that he could\r\nrecognize the touch of a landscape artist, and a generally happy effect\r\ngives to this miniature all the value of a painting.\r\n\r\n'Here followeth the fifth triumph of Messire Francisque Petrarque, the\r\nwhich is the triumph of Time.'\r\n\r\nThe miniature occupies two pages and includes two subjects. In one, Time,\r\nrepresented by the signs of the zodiac, and by the allegorical figures of\r\nantiquity, marks his progress in the sky; mortals undergo his influence on\r\nthe earth. The artist has signed his work at the right, at the foot of the\r\npicture, this time with his full name: 'Godefroy.' In the other miniature\r\nthe triumph of Time is represented. He is passing in his chariot, drawn\r\nby four horses at a gallop, between the four Seasons. On the left, at the\r\nfoot, we see a G and two lizards.\r\n\r\n'Here followeth the sixth and last triumph of Messire Francisque\r\nPetrarque, the which is the triumph of the Deity.'\r\n\r\nThis title is followed by a double miniature. In one, we see God the\r\nFather and Jesus Christ, with the Holy Spirit soaring above their heads,\r\nseated on the globe and presiding at the last day. Flames fall from the\r\nskies upon mankind, who are divided into the good and the bad; angels\r\ntranquilly lead the former, while devils brutally pursue the others. At\r\nthe foot, on the right, is the G. On the other page, God the Father and\r\nGod the Son (the Holy Spirit hovering over them as before) are seated in\r\na triumphal chariot drawn by the ox, the lion, the eagle, and the angel,\r\nwhich are the symbols of the evangelists. They come forward, surrounded by\r\nall the dignitaries of the Church. Pagan Love, with bandaged eyes, lies\r\ndead on the ground near the chariot wheels; a long procession of saints,\r\nmale and female, concealed below the waist by an elevation, are following\r\nthe course of the chariot in the foreground. This arrangement made it\r\npossible for the artist to make his figures larger and to delineate their\r\nfeatures with care. The G is at the foot of the miniature, on the ground.\r\n\r\nAll these miniatures, painted in grisaille, with blue skies and water, and\r\nwith some few details in colour, are 86 millimetres high and 68 wide.\r\n\r\n    Comte Léon de Laborde.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nIn the catalogue of the library of M. Firmin Didot père, sold in 1811, is\r\nthe following description of a magnificent manuscript:[311]--\r\n\r\n'The first three books of Diodorus Siculus, translated from Latin into\r\nFrench by Antoine Macault. Small folio, in blue morocco, with dentelles,\r\n_lavé_, _réglé_, bound with the arms of François I, whose cipher it bears\r\non the back and on the cover.\r\n\r\n'A superb manuscript on vellum, presented to François I, containing 173\r\nleaves, 30 lines to the page. It is illustrated with miniatures and\r\nwith a large number of initial letters painted with the utmost care.\r\nThe first miniature represents François I surrounded by the nobles and\r\nscholars of his court; it is 10 inches high and 6½ wide. This painting,\r\nof the most finished workmanship, has the additional merit of presenting\r\nthe features of several great men of that time. All the pages on which\r\nchapters begin are set in fillets of gold and ultramarine. The initials\r\nare 19 lines high and 12 wide. More than fifty of these initials represent\r\nthe principal subjects of their respective chapters. The third book is\r\nespecially noteworthy, for, beginning with page 130, there is a series of\r\nsmall miniatures, admirable in execution and of the greatest exactness in\r\nrespect of forms.\r\n\r\n'This manuscript has the advantage of being in a most excellent state of\r\npreservation.'\r\n\r\nIt was sold to M. Brunet, author of the 'Manuel du Libraire,' for 1476\r\nfrancs (not including the usual expenses); he bought for William Beckford,\r\nEsq., of Fonthill Abbey in the County of Wilts, of which Salisbury is the\r\nshire town. The author of the 'Repertorium Bibliographicum,' printed at\r\nLondon in 1819, informs us that Macault's manuscript was at that time in\r\nthe library of that distinguished collector, which is described on pages\r\n203 to 230 of the 'Repertorium.'[312]\r\n\r\nThe description of the manuscript is as follows:--\r\n\r\n    DIODORE.--LES TROIS PREMIERS LIVRES DE DIODORE SICILIEN,\r\n    HISTORIOGRAPHE GREC DES ANTIQUITEZ DEGIPTE, ETHIOPIE ET AUTRES PAYS\r\n    DASIE ET DAFFRIQUE.

On one side, in a square\r\ncompartment, in gold letters: DIODORE SICILIEN. On the opposite\r\nside: AV ROY FRANCOYS PREMIER.\r\n\r\n'This fine manuscript, formerly in the possession of Francis the First,\r\nappears to have been executed by his express command. Prefixed to the\r\nhistory is a painting of the King seated under a canopy powdered with\r\nfleurs-de-lis, surrounded by his courtiers: his three sons, the Dauphin\r\nFrancis, Henry, afterwards Henry II, and Charles, Duke of Orleans, dressed\r\nin rich habits, appear in the foreground. The King seems to direct his\r\nattention to a person reading, dressed as an ecclesiastic, probably the\r\ntranslator of the History. A beautiful greyhound on the floor, and a\r\nmarmoset, sitting on the table, near the King's left hand, are prominent\r\nfigures in the groupe [_sic_]. In addition to this exquisite illumination,\r\nthe volume is enriched with numerous large initial letters, painted with\r\npeculiar delicacy, representing occurrences described in the book, manners\r\nof various nations, and portraits of their early emperors and kings.'[313]\r\n\r\nThis description is accompanied by an engraving on copper of the figure of\r\nFrançois I, after the Macault MS. The King is depicted full face, seated\r\nbefore a table on which, near his left hand, is a monkey. The background\r\nis a tapestry covered with fleurs-de-lis. This engraving is dated July 1,\r\n1817, and is the work of M. Behnes. It differs from the engraving on wood\r\nfound in Macault's printed volume, not only in that it does not include\r\nthe various persons of the original drawing, but also in the details of\r\nthe King's costume. I have every reason to believe that the wood engraving\r\nis a faithful reproduction of the original, just as the book itself is a\r\nreproduction of the manuscript, except for the other drawings, which were\r\nomitted, from economical motives, no doubt.\r\n\r\nMacault's volume is a quarto, consisting of 8 leaves of preface, 154 of\r\ntext (signatures A to Q), and 8 of index. The author's preface begins with\r\nan S from which depends a shield (probably Macault's), bearing two fasces\r\naccompanied by nine bezants arranged in threes, and having for a motto the\r\nGreek word ΜΗΚΕΤΙ (not at all). The letter is repeated\r\non folio 148. The first page has a border in the shape of a portico, like\r\nthose in the opuscula published by Tory in 1531 and described on pp.\r\n202-203. At the foot is the date 1535. On the verso we find the final\r\nborder of 'Champ fleury,' within which are drawn, in the vellum copy\r\npreserved at the Bibliothèque Nationale, the royal arms of England, with\r\nthe motto DIEV EST [_sic_] MON DROICT, below.[314]\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n    PAULI JOVII NOVOCOMENSIS VITÆ DUODECIM VICECOMITUM MEDIOLANI\r\n    PRINCIPUM.\r\n\r\nFolio manuscript of 137 leaves.

It is dated at Rome, the 4th of the\r\nKalends of April (March 29), 1547.\r\n\r\nIt is not certain that Tory did any work on this manuscript, but I mention\r\nit because of the engravings of the portraits, which appeared in the\r\nedition published in 1549.[315]\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n    RECUEIL DES ROIS DE FRANCE, LEURS COURONNE ET MAISON, etc.,\r\n    by Jean du Tillet, register in chief of the Parliament of Paris.\r\n\r\nLarge folio manuscript on vellum; Bibliothèque Nationale.

The work was still unpublished\r\nwhen the author died, in 1570; it would seem, however, that he had long\r\nbeen preparing to print, since we find in the edition of 1580 engravings\r\nsigned with the Lorraine cross.[317]\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nIn 'Les Récréations historiques,' by Dreux Duradier, on page 102 of volume\r\none, we read:\r\n\r\n'In the manuscript of the late M. Lancelot, written, it is said, by the\r\nhand of G. Tory, with the date of 1546, is found this ballad in honour of\r\nthe Virgin:--\r\n\r\n    '\"Balade de Lyon Jamet sur la Vierge:\r\n      Qui me crea je l'ai conçu,\" etc.'\r\n\r\nI have vainly sought this manuscript among all those of Lancelot owned by\r\nthe Bibliothèque, of which there is a special catalogue; but I have been\r\nunable to find it.\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\nIn order to omit nothing, I will also mention here another valuable\r\nmanuscript of the Bibliothèque Nationale, on one of the miniatures of\r\nwhich is a G, followed by a small T or F, which may fairly be attributed\r\nto Geofroy Tory. It is a translation of Livy, in two large folio volumes,\r\non vellum, acquired from the Bibliothèque de la Sorbonne, and enriched\r\nwith magnificent engravings, attributed to Jean Fouquet, which, however,\r\ncannot be his, for the book has, on the first page, the arms of François\r\nde Rochechouart and Blanche d'Aumont, who were married about 1480 and\r\ndied, both, in 1530. Evidently it was not in the early years of their\r\nmarriage that the book was written; and, as it must have occupied several\r\nyears, and, in fact, was never finished, there is nothing extraordinary in\r\nthe idea that Tory may have executed some of the miniatures about 1520.\r\nFurthermore, in order to place the reader in a position to judge for\r\nhimself, I will add that the cipher mentioned above is painted on the leg\r\nof the figures in the miniature on page 123 of volume one.[318]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 299: According to M.

M.

I should probably have made\r\nthe same mistake, had I not, even before I saw this miniature, made the\r\nacquaintance of the huntsman in question upon reading the accounts of\r\nthe expenditure of François I, the lists of his household, and the rolls\r\nof receipts given to his treasurer. I find, for example, under date of\r\nJuly 12, 1531: 'Due to Perot de Ruthie, in payment of such emoluments and\r\nprivileges as he has by virtue of his office of keeper of the park and\r\ncastle of Saincte Jame, and of the forests and four ponds of Raiz.' Five\r\nyears later, I find this entry: 'To Perot de Ruthie, to be used for the\r\nnecessary expenses of sending for and causing to be brought to him a part\r\nof the dogs, with their whippers-in, from his kennels in the forest of\r\nChenonces.'

PRINTED BOOKS ILLUSTRATED WITH ENGRAVINGS BY TORY OR HIS\r\nPUPILS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1515\r\n\r\nThere appeared for the first time, in the books of Hours published\r\nby Simon Vostre about 1515, three engravings which are clearly\r\ndistinguishable in method of execution from those previously used by the\r\nsame bookseller, to which the three new ones were thereafter added.\r\n\r\nThenceforth Vostre's Hours contained three varieties of engraving: (1) The\r\nold gothic woodcuts (among which must be reckoned the Dance of Death with\r\ndotted background), which figure in the editions issued by that bookseller\r\neven in the fifteenth century; (2) Two large drawings in the Renaissance\r\nstyle, which appear in his editions of 1507 and which may be attributed\r\nto Jean Perreal, Tory's teacher; (3) The three in question, which do not\r\nappear earlier than 1514 or 1515. These engravings are: (I) The\r\nAdoration of the Shepherds, signed with the letter G in a gothic shield;\r\n(II) The Adoration of the Magi; (III) The Circumcision;\r\nthe last two signed with this monogram: [Illustration: F]. The\r\nG is still inclined to the gothic, but the second letter is altogether\r\nroman. In my judgement, this monogram should be translated by the words,\r\n'Godofredus faciebat,' or 'fecit.' It is true that the ascription of these\r\nengravings to Tory has been contested; but Jules Renouvier, whose taste\r\nwas so unerring, and who cannot be accused of infatuation for Tory, did\r\nnot hesitate to adopt my hypothesis. 'In the last of Vostre's Hours,' he\r\nsays, in the pamphlet that he published concerning that bookseller, 'we\r\nsee, besides the plates executed in the old French manner, which have\r\nnot disappeared as yet, other plates in the Italian and German manners,\r\nsubjects treated in an altogether novel style: the Adoration of the\r\nShepherds, the Adoration of the Kings, and the Circumcision, are composed\r\nof small figures in a large ground; the design has recovered all its\r\ndelicacy, in its clearly drawn forms, and the cutting is done with no less\r\ndiversity than care. Here, luckily,' continues Renouvier, 'a monogram\r\nenables us to attribute the engravings to their author. It is a G alone,\r\nor enclosing an F, subscribed on a shield or in a cartouche\r\nhanging from a branch. They have been claimed for Geofroy Tory, and with\r\ngood reason, for the manner in which these plates are executed accords\r\nwith what we know of that excellent artist.'\r\n\r\nIt is, perhaps, to these engravings, so successfully executed, that we\r\nshould ascribe the partiality that Tory afterwards displayed for books\r\nof Hours, of which, as we have seen, he put forth several editions, in\r\ndiverse formats, and with a large number of engravings on wood done by\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\r\n1516-1518\r\n\r\nHere is to be placed Tory's second journey to Rome,[319] from which he\r\nreturned more Italian than ever, in respect to art.\r\n\r\n\r\n1519-1520\r\n\r\nUnder this date, which was when Tory was working at the manuscripts I\r\nhave described above, I shall place, albeit somewhat conjecturally, two\r\nsmall engravings on wood, signed with the letters G T, which appear in a\r\npublication of M. Varlot entitled: 'Illustration de l'ancienne imprimerie\r\ntroyenne' (4to, 1850). They are numbers 84 and 131, the first in the\r\ncriblé style, the second in the style of the Renaissance. My ascription\r\nof them to Tory is based upon the facts that they are of his time, as we\r\nmay infer from the one in the criblé style, and that the initials G T\r\nare entirely consistent with that period of the life of our artist, who\r\nsometimes signed his name in full, Geofroy Tory, as witness his Hours of\r\n1524.\r\n\r\nThe first of these engravings, number 84, represents a Descent from the\r\nCross. The letters G T are at the foot of the plate, and are some distance\r\napart.[320] In the same collection there is another engraving of the same\r\nseries, but not signed--number 78. It represents a bishop blessing a sick\r\nman who lies entirely nude before him. These two are 48 millimetres wide\r\nby 62 high.\r\n\r\nNumber 131 represents a scene from Terence. The letters G T are side by\r\nside at the foot of the plate, which is 33 millimetres high by 55 wide.\r\nIn the same collection, numbers 132 and 133, are two other woodcuts of\r\nthe same series, but not signed. Lastly, in an edition of Æsop, published\r\nrecently at Troyes, by the printer Baudot, we find a woodcut which\r\nprobably had the same origin, and found its way into this volume by\r\nchance. These four engravings are evidently from an edition of Terence in\r\na small format; I have been unable to find it.\r\n\r\n\r\n1520-1521\r\n\r\nI shall place under this date a title-page, in octavo, forming a border,\r\nengraved for Simon de Colines, and bearing his mark and his initials. This\r\nprinter, who succeeded in 1520 Henri Estienne, the first of the name,\r\nwhose widow he married, wished to mark his printings in some special way,\r\nand to that end applied to Tory, who was a friend of the family. Tory\r\nengraved the title-page in question, in the criblé style, then much in\r\nvogue; and on it are seen rabbits, or _conils_, which is believed to be\r\nan allusion to the name of Colines.[321] Tory's mark appears in white, at\r\nthe foot of the engraving, to the right. I have seen this engraving in an\r\nEpitome of the 'Adages' of Erasmus, in Latin, printed by Simon de Colines,\r\nin 1523, in octavo, under this title: 'Johannis Brucherii Trecensis\r\nAdagiorum ad studiosæ juventutis utilitatem ex Erasmicis chiliadibus\r\nexcerptorum epitome.' It was probably Tory, too, who engraved Colines's\r\nlarge mark with the rabbits (Silvestre, no. 79), which is in the same\r\nstyle, and which appears in the Hours of 1524; but it does not bear the\r\ndouble cross. Tory also engraved for Colines two other marks in a very\r\ndifferent style (Silvestre, nos. 80 and 329), and a multitude of borders\r\nand illustrations for his books.\r\n\r\nColines certainly employed Tory more than any other printer did, as we\r\nshall see in the sequel. This fact leads me to believe that Lottin is\r\nmistaken in bestowing upon Colines the title of engraver of letters,\r\nattributing to him doubtless the engraving of the graceful italics that\r\nhe used in works written in verse; I am convinced that those letters are\r\nthe work of Tory. I will call attention, however, to the fact that the\r\ncapitals that go with these italics are roman, and may belong to the roman\r\nletters which Simon de Colines had from Henri Estienne. But the font is\r\nenriched with some white two-line letters, of a charming design, which are\r\ncertainly Tory's, as are the floriated letters used by Colines and his\r\nstepson Robert Estienne.\r\n\r\n\r\n1521-1522\r\n\r\nI. Tory engraved also for Simon de Colines a magnificent\r\ntitle-page intended for a very rare work, which, for that reason, I\r\nthink that I ought to describe in detail (after one of the copies in the\r\nBibliothèque Nationale), for its existence has been doubted.[322]\r\n\r\nThe book is entitled: 'Commentarii initiatorii in quatuor Evangelia,'\r\netc., with no author's name on the title-page; but it was written by\r\nJacques Lefèvre d'Etaples, as we shall see in a moment. It is a folio, of\r\n6 unnumbered preliminary leaves, and of 377 numbered leaves, making 192\r\nsheets, divided into 50 folds of 4 sheets each, except the first, which\r\nhas only 3. The signatures go from _a_ to _ddd_ consecutively. The text\r\nof the Gospels is set in large type (great primer), the notes in smaller\r\ntype (pica), in which there are some very handsome Greek characters, with\r\naccents, which were still a novelty at that time.\r\n\r\nThe title is in a wide border, engraved on wood, decorated with the\r\nsymbols of the four evangelists, beneath which are printed passages from\r\ntheir works. This border, which is signed with the Lorraine cross at the\r\nfoot, on the right side, is .225 metre high by .166 wide.\r\n\r\nOn the second preliminary leaf the author's preface begins, under this\r\nheading: 'Jacobi Fabri Stapulensis ad Christianos lectores in sequens opus\r\nPræfatio.' It ends on the fourth preliminary leaf, with the date, 'Meldis,\r\nanno M. D. XXI.' Then follows a concordance of the four Gospels,\r\nin the form of tablets closed at top and bottom by unsigned engravings.\r\n\r\nThe Gospel according to St. Matthew, which opens the book, begins with\r\na superb ornamented L, on a criblé background, .058 metre in height by\r\n.055 in width. The Gospel according to St. Mark, which opens on leaf\r\n115 (erroneously printed 215), begins with an I of the same style and\r\ndimensions. The Gospel according to St. Luke begins on folio 175 verso,\r\nwith an F like the two preceding letters. The Gospel according to St. John\r\nbegins on folio 259, with the I that has already done duty in the Gospel\r\nof St. Mark. These letters, which are altogether in the style of those\r\nafterwards engraved by Tory for Robert Estienne, seem to me to be fairly\r\nattributable to him, although unsigned.\r\n\r\nIn the balance of the book we find a large number of other letters\r\nornamented in the criblé style, but of smaller size, which cannot be\r\nTory's.\r\n\r\nOn folios 101 verso and 102 recto are certain astronomical figures,\r\nunsigned, which I dare not attribute to Tory; but I do not hesitate to\r\nattribute to him a large engraving on folio 182 verso. It represents\r\nJesus in an aureole of flame. Below him is the sea; above him the Father\r\nEverlasting, blessing with the right hand, and holding in his left hand\r\nthe globe surmounted by a cross. He is uttering these words which we read\r\nin a scroll: 'Hic est filius meus dilectus in quo mihi bene complacui.'\r\nThis engraving, including its border, is .210 metre in height by .137 wide.\r\n\r\nOn the last page is a subscription in these words: MELDIS, IMPENSIS\r\nSIMONIS COLINAEI ANNO SALVTIS HVMANAE M. D. XXII. MENSE IVNIO.\r\n\r\nWho printed this book? Not Simon de Colines, as La Caille said, and as\r\nMaittaire and Panzer have repeated after him, for the subscription means\r\nsimply that the printing was done at his expense. One can understand,\r\nin truth, that Simon de Colines, who had at the time an extensive\r\ntypographical establishment at Paris in full blast, could not leave\r\nthat city to print a book at Meaux. Nor was it a local printer, for no\r\nother contemporary printing at Meaux is known; moreover, the mechanical\r\nexecution of this volume, and the engravings with which it is embellished,\r\nprove that it did not come from a wretched provincial workshop.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion there is but one way of explaining this typographical\r\nenigma. It is this: Guillaume Briçonnet (second of the name), having been\r\nappointed Bishop of Meaux in 1518, took with him to that town his friend\r\nLefèvre d'Etaples, to whom he entrusted the administration of his diocese.\r\nEtaples employed his leisure in writing various religious works, among\r\nothers the Commentaries on the Gospels, which were finished in 1521.\r\nWishing to have this bulky volume, which was of capital importance to him,\r\nprinted under his own eyes, and being unable to leave Meaux, where he was\r\ndetained by his duties, Lefèvre simply imported from Paris a portion of\r\nSimon de Colines's printing-office, with a small staff.[323] In this way\r\nhe could not only superintend the printing of his book, but also lend a\r\nhand at need, after the example of many another scholar of that time who\r\ndid not scorn to practise the printing art.\r\n\r\nWhat I have said is a mere hypothesis, it is true; but this hypothesis\r\nis surrounded by circumstances which give it a powerful appearance of\r\ntruth. In addition to what I have said above, I will say that the types of\r\nLefèvre d'Etaples' book are the same as those used in an octavo printed\r\nat Paris by Simon de Colines in 1523,--a book which I have already cited\r\nand which I now have before me. It is entitled: 'Joannis Brucherii\r\nTrecensis Adagiorum ... ex Erasmicis chiliadibus excerptorum Epitome.' The\r\ntitle-page has a border signed with the Lorraine cross. More than that,\r\nthe first ornamental letter in Etaples' book, which is an A on a criblé\r\nbackground, is also the first letter of the book of Johannes Brucherius;\r\nwhence we see that the typographical material sent to Meaux returned to\r\nParis immediately after Etaples' book was printed.\r\n\r\nDoubtless that is why we have only one book dated at Meaux at that period;\r\nit might be, however, that advantage was taken of the momentary existence\r\nof this printing-office at Meaux to set up some trifling work, in 1521 or\r\n1522; but that would not in any wise modify my conclusion.\r\n\r\nII. Tory engraved also, at about the same time, for a printer at\r\nTroyes named Jean Lecoq, the title-page, in the shape of a border, of a\r\n'Gradual'[324] of the Cistercian Order--a very large and handsome folio,\r\nprinted at Troyes in 1521. This engraving is in the criblé style, with the\r\ndouble cross in white at the foot, on the right. At about the same time\r\nhe engraved in the same style Jean Lecoq's mark, which appears at the end\r\nof the volume, and of which a reproduction may be seen in M. Silvestre's\r\nbook, no. 875.\r\n\r\nAs this Gradual is very rare (only one copy of it is known to exist, which\r\nI have seen in M. Tross's collection) and very beautiful, I think it well\r\nto describe it. It is almost needless to say that it is printed in gothic\r\ntype.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, above the title there is a line printed in black:--\r\n\r\n    Jesus ✥ Maria Bernard\r\n\r\n(It is well known that St. Bernard was the founder of the Cistercian\r\nOrder.) Then, in red (I complete the abbreviated words):--\r\n\r\n'Graduale ad usum Cisterciensis ordinis: secundum capituli generalis\r\nvenerabilium patrum ejusdem ordinis diffinitionem in sequenti paginas\r\ndeclarata: noviter per quendam Clarevallensem monachum ad debitam formam\r\nutiliter redactum. Et Johannis Lecoq impressoris Trecis commorantis\r\nsolertia diligenter impressum. Anno Domini Millesimo quingentesimo\r\nvicesimo primo.' (Here Lecoq's large mark: Silvestre, no. 877.) 'Cum\r\nprivilegio.'\r\n\r\nThe volume is made up of 2 preliminary leaves, for the title, etc., and\r\n252 pages of text, divided as follows: First part, without pagination,\r\nof 18 signatures (_a_ to _s_) of 4 sheets each, except the last, which\r\nhas only 2,--in all, 140 leaves. Second part, folios 1 to 112, having 14\r\nsignatures (A to O) of 4 sheets--in all, 112 leaves.\r\n\r\nThe paper is very strong and fine. It is one of the earliest books\r\nprinted with music in France, and it reflects great credit on the presses\r\nof Troyes, and especially upon Jean Lecoq, first of the name. Names of\r\nplaces and persons are consistently printed with capitals. The work is\r\nillustrated with a few engravings; but its most remarkable feature is the\r\nornamental initials and uncial letters with which it is embellished.\r\n\r\nAt the end, by way of colophon, are these words:--\r\n\r\n'Explicit Graduale secundum usum ordinis Cisterciensis, Trecis impressum\r\n\r\nPer Johannem Lecoq, Anno Domini Millesimo quingentesimo vigesimo primo Die\r\nsexta mensis Martii. Laus Deo.'\r\n\r\nHere Lecoq's mark with the Lorraine cross in white.\r\n\r\nThis volume came from the ancient monastery of Oliva, near Dantzig.\r\n\r\n\r\n1522\r\n\r\nI. We may place under this date two other frontispieces signed\r\nwith the Lorraine cross. The first is a large engraving divided into four\r\ncompartments, and representing armies in battle array, with cannon. The\r\ntwo upper compartments are connected by the shield of France, surmounted\r\nby a crown and encircled by the order of Saint-Michel, from which branches\r\nof rose-bushes depend on either side. In each compartment there is a\r\ncartouche. Tory's mark is at the foot of the lower left-hand compartment,\r\nin which the banner of France is seen waving. This engraving appears in\r\nthe 'Rozier historial de France,' a folio printed in gothic type, at\r\nParis, for François Regnault, February 10, 1522, before Easter; that is\r\nto say, 1523 new style. In the cartouches the following words are printed\r\nin red, in gothic type: 'Bataille ronde,' 'Bataille de pointe,' 'Bataille\r\nde feu,' 'Bataille de fourche.'[325] It appears in another edition of the\r\nsame book, printed in 1528 for the same bookseller; also, in a translation\r\nof Cæsar's 'Commentaries,' printed by Pierre Vidoue, in 1531, for the\r\nbooksellers Poncet Le Preux and Galiot du Pré. This translation is a folio\r\nvolume divided into two parts, the first translated by Étienne Delaigue,\r\ncalled Beauvoys, the second by Robert Gaguin. The plate in question is\r\nat the end of the first part, folio 95 verso. The whole book is printed\r\nin black, both text and engraving. I am indebted for my knowledge of the\r\nengraving to M. Robert-Dumesnil _fils_.\r\n\r\nII. The second engraving, in the form of a border (folio size),\r\nrepresenting a number of grotesque and licentious subjects, appears in an\r\nedition of the 'Histoire du saint Graal,' published by Philippe le Noir,\r\nsworn bookseller and binder to the University of Paris, on October 24,\r\n1523. The bookseller's initials are in the compartment at the top of the\r\nborder.[326]\r\n\r\nIn this book, as well as in those last described, there are other\r\nengravings; but they are not the work of Tory, to whom only the important\r\npieces were assigned. These other engravings had, doubtless, appeared\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nAs for the engraving executed by Tory (which reappears in many other\r\nworks printed by Philippe le Noir), it is a copy of a plate engraved by\r\nUrs Graf, dated 1519, and used by Pierre Vidoue, printer at Paris,[327]\r\nparticularly in a Virgil of 1529, folio, which is now in the Bibliothèque\r\nMazarine. The four principal subjects of this engraving, placed at the\r\nfour corners of the border, represent: (1) Men lighting torches at a\r\nwoman's posterior; (2) A woman carrying off a man in a basket[328]; (3)\r\nThe death of Pyramus and Thisbe; (4) The judgement of Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n1523\r\n\r\nWhile working for others, Tory busied himself with a long series of\r\nengravings intended for books of Hours to be published by himself.[329]\r\n\r\n'It is upon turning over these plates,' says M. Renouvier,[330] 'that one\r\nappreciates to the full his style--rich, diversified and immeasurably\r\nclever in ornamentation, distorted out of proportion, diabolic in the\r\ndrawing of faces, descending too often to downright awkwardness in the\r\ncarriage of the head and to a habit of bellying out draperies; and,\r\nfinally, overweighted by a sort of heaviness in the forms. The artist's\r\ngreatest facility is shown in the arrangement of his figures, and in the\r\ndecoration of his porticoes. Whatever he may say, it would seem that what\r\nhe studied at Rome with the best results were the baths of Titus and the\r\narabesques of Giovanni da Udino.'\r\n\r\n\r\n1524-1525\r\n\r\nWe have seen that Tory had been in the habit for some time of signing his\r\nengravings with a double cross; but this had not yet become an invariable\r\nsignature. For instance, about 1524 he often used a monogram in which his\r\nname and surname--or, to use the terms of the present day his Christian\r\nname [_prénom_] and his family name [_nom de famille_]--both appear. It\r\nconsists of a capital G, enclosing a smaller S, with the [Illustration]\r\ndouble cross above. This means, in my opinion, that Tory was the\r\n_engraver_ only ('Godofredus Torinus sculpsit'), in distinction from the\r\ncross alone, which means that Tory both drew and engraved the pieces\r\non which it appears. In fact, we find in most of those signed with the\r\nmonogram a roughness of aspect which is not characteristic of Tory's usual\r\nstyle.\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, here is a list of the pieces known to me on which\r\nthis monogram appears.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I. LE BLAZON DES HERETIQUES.\r\n\r\nQuarto of 14 leaves, in gothic type, printed by Philippe Le Noir, 'sworn\r\nbinder to the University of Paris,' with a privilege from the court of\r\nthe Parliament of Paris, dated December 21, 1524. This is a satirical\r\nproduction, in verse, attributed to Pierre Gringoire, otherwise called\r\nVaudemont, at the head of which appears the figure, or effigy, of the\r\n'heretic,' signed with the monogram in question. The description of the\r\neffigy is as follows:\r\n\r\n    En gibeciere on luy voit ratz avoir,\r\n    Qui sont rongeans et serpens detestables\r\n    En son giron faisant mords diffamables.\r\n    De son sian sort ung aspre feu vollant,\r\n    Qui cueur et corps et livres est bruslant.[331]\r\n\r\nThis very rare work was reprinted at Chartres, in 1832, under the auspices\r\nof M. Hérisson, the librarian of that city. The reprint contains a\r\nfacsimile of the engraving.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    II. HEURES DE NOSTRE DAME, TRANSLATEES EN FRANCOYS\r\n    ET MISES EN RITHME PAR PIERRE GRINGOIRE, DIT VAUDEMONT, PAR\r\n    LE COMMANDEMENT DE ... MADAME REGNEE DE BOURBON, DUCHESSE DE\r\n    LORRAINE, etc.\r\n\r\nA quarto, in gothic type, undated, but containing a table of Easter-Days\r\nbeginning with 1524, and a privilege dated October 10, 1525.\r\n\r\nThis book, which was published by the bookseller Jean Petit, contains 13\r\nlarge engravings, a list of which follows:--\r\n\r\n    1. The Annunciation.\r\n    2. Adam and Eve.\r\n    3. The Cross.\r\n    4. The Holy Ghost.\r\n    5. The Descent of the Holy Ghost upon the Apostles.\r\n    6. David praying for Zion, threatened with the divine thunderbolts.\r\n    7. The Virgin and the Child Jesus.\r\n    8. A Family at Table (Pentecost?).\r\n    9. Eight Naked Children Praying; the Holy Trinity in the Heavens.\r\n    10. The Manna.\r\n    11. David's Penance.\r\n    12. The Triumph of Death.\r\n    13. Jesus receiving the Crown of Thorns and the Reed.\r\n\r\nOnly the last of these bears the monogram that I have described[332]; but\r\nthe other engravings, being in the same style, should all be attributed to\r\nTory. We might perhaps also attribute to him the six analogous engravings\r\nwhich appear in the same author's 'Chants royaux' (printed at the same\r\ntime and usually bound with the Hours), but not one of which is signed.\r\nThey represent:--\r\n\r\n    1. The Synagogue: Jesus in the background, entering a pillar.\r\n    2. The Prodigal Son: Jesus in the background, curing a woman.\r\n    3. Hunters: Jesus in the background, curing one possessed of devils.\r\n    4. The Miracle of the Loaves and Fishes.\r\n    5. Entrance of Jesus into Jerusalem.\r\n    6. The Crowning with Thorns.\r\n\r\nThese two books have been reprinted several times. I know of four quarto\r\neditions of the Hours.[333] The first is the one I have just described.\r\nIt contains some other engravings, in an entirely different style from\r\nTory's, which appear also in other books of Hours of older date. The\r\nsecond has a table of Easter-Days beginning with 1528, and a privilege\r\ndated November 15, 1527. In other respects it is similar to the earlier\r\none. The third has a table of Easter-Days beginning with 1534. It is like\r\nthe last except in one point: in place of the final engraving there is a\r\ndifferent one, signed in the same way, representing Job at prayer before\r\nhis burning house, and his neighbours reviling him. This engraving proves\r\nthat Tory must have engraved a longer series from which the printer took\r\nthis one at random, being unable at the moment to find the one that he\r\nrequired. The fourth has a calendar beginning with 1540. It is like the\r\nsecond, except for the privilege, which is dated November, 1525, doubtless\r\nby mistake. These four editions are all in the Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    III. HISTOIRE ... DE LA ...

DUC DE CALABRE ..., PAR NICOLE VOLCYR\r\n    (otherwise called Volkire) DE SEROUVILLE, etc.\r\n\r\nSmall folio, in gothic type, without date of printing, but with a\r\nprivilege dated January 12, 1526 (1527 new style), issued by Jean de la\r\nBarre, 'garde de la prévôté' of Paris. The battle took place in 1525.\r\n\r\nVolcyr's work contains seven engravings, but only the last two, at\r\nthe beginning of the last two books, are signed. We may, however, I\r\nthink, attribute to Tory the one at the head of the first book also. A\r\ndescription of these engravings follows:--\r\n\r\n1. Frontispiece representing Faith: a helmeted woman trampling upon the\r\ndragon.\r\n\r\n2. The author, seated, writing his book.\r\n\r\n3. A large plate representing a warrior (the Duke of Calabria?) amidst his\r\nmen, waving his sword.\r\n\r\n4. A bishop praying.\r\n\r\n5. The author offering his book to the prince. A fine plate on which are\r\nseveral scattered letters, the meaning of which I am unable to conceive.\r\n\r\n6. A large plate representing the attack on the town of Saverne. At the\r\ntop is the word 'Saberna.'\r\n\r\n7. A large plate representing the vision of the Passion. Jesus at prayer,\r\na halo about his head; facing him, angels presenting the Cross; behind\r\nhim, other angels bearing the post to which he was bound; all about him,\r\nthe instruments of his torture. This plate is altogether in the manner of\r\nthose in the following work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    IV. THE LABOURS OF HERCULES.\r\n\r\nTwelve large plates, folio, owned by the Bibliothèque Nationale. Each of\r\nthem was formerly accompanied by a number and by a quatrain in French\r\nexplaining the subject; unfortunately these have been removed from most\r\nof the plates,[334] and it is impossible for me to-day to place them with\r\nfull assurance in the order in which they belong. However, that given\r\nbelow seems to me most natural. The three which retain their numbers are\r\nmarked by an asterisk.\r\n\r\n    1. The Nemean Lion.\r\n    2. The Lernean Hydra.\r\n    *3. Cerberus.\r\n    4. Antæus.\r\n    5. Archelaus.\r\n    6. Hippodamia.\r\n    7. Geryon.\r\n    8. The Pillars of Hercules.\r\n    *9.The Cretan Bull.\r\n    *10. The Erymanthian Boar.\r\n    11. Cacus.\r\n    12. Hercules at the Stake.\r\n\r\nAll of these engravings are signed: [Illustration: S in G]\r\n\r\nWe give here, as specimens, three of the quatrains accompanying the\r\nengravings; they are the only ones preserved at the Bibliothèque\r\nNationale. They may very well be the work of Gringoire, like the verses of\r\nthe 'Blazon des Hérétiques,' of the same date.\r\n\r\n_Number_ 3\r\n\r\n    Il braue les enffers (chose à luy tresaisee),\r\n    Et le chien Cerberus, aux trois chefz surmontant;\r\n    Il va les Infernaux main à main combattant,\r\n    Pour mettre en liberté son bon amy Thesee.\r\n\r\n_Number_ 9\r\n\r\n    Les furieux Thaureaux (choses esmerveillables)\r\n    De ses deux bras nerveux Il maitrise aisement,\r\n    Et leur faict faire Ioug desoubs luy forcement\r\n    Encor qu'on estimat qu'ils fussent indomptables.\r\n\r\n_Number_ 10\r\n\r\n    Ung sanglier escumeux à la grand' dent pointue,\r\n    Qui hommes, vignes et bleds degatoient enragé,\r\n    Et par qui l'vniuers estoit endommagé,\r\n    Seul, par sa hardiesse, Il acreuante et tue.[335]\r\n\r\nThe orthography of these verses proves that they were printed in the\r\nseventeenth century[336]; but the very appearance of the verses, and the\r\ncondition of the plates, which are already worm-eaten, are sufficient to\r\njustify one in assigning to the latter a very much earlier date than to\r\nthe former. So that I can do no better than to refer them to the year\r\n1525, when we find Tory using the same monogram.\r\n\r\nTory seems to have attempted in these plates to imitate Mantegna, whose\r\nwork he may have studied in Italy; but he had the good sense to abandon\r\nthis manner, which was not his own; or perhaps we should say that he did\r\nno more than follow designs which were supplied to him.\r\n\r\nThis is what M. Renouvier has to say on this subject:--\r\n\r\n'The plates signed with a G surmounted by the Lorraine cross are of\r\nmore importance. The Labours of Hercules, in twelve plates, are the\r\nwork of no commonplace artist. The drawing assumes a masterly, even a\r\nrough, character, seeking effects in the play of muscles and of facial\r\nexpression in imitation of Mantegna and Albrecht Dürer; the cutting\r\nfollows up the effect of the burin. Bartsch mentioned them among the old\r\nGerman masters, and the monogrammatists wavered between Jean Schoorel,\r\nGeorges Scharfenberg, Giuseppe Scolari, etc.; their French origin was\r\nnot suspected until some proofs were found on which the engravings were\r\naccompanied by French quatrains. Then, when the same mark was found\r\non a plate used as a frontispiece to Pierre Gringoire's \"Blazon des\r\nHérétiques\" (1524), and on several vignettes in the Hours _rendered into\r\nverse_, by the same poet, it was attempted to make a wood-engraver of\r\nGringoire, who was a Lorrainer, herald-at-arms to Duc René II, and likely\r\nenough to display the cross of Lorraine over his initial. This much is\r\ncertain: that the mark consisting of a G with the cross of Lorraine is\r\nfound also on the plates of a Lorraine book--\"Duc Anthoine's Victory\r\nover the Lutherans\"--published by his secretary Volcyr, who paid the\r\nexpenses of the publication, \"being unable to find any bookseller who was\r\nwilling to undertake it, as well because of the portraits and cuts of the\r\nillustrations as of the printing hereof,\" and caused it to be issued,\r\nnot in Lorraine, but in Paris, by Galliot Dupré, in 1526. It is to be\r\nnoticed that this bookseller's mark, which represents a galliot, also has\r\na Lorraine cross surmounting his cipher. Now, the attribution of these\r\nplates to Geofroy Tory is based upon some very ingenious comparisons of\r\nmarks; the style of the engravings places no insurmountable obstacle in\r\nthe way of such attribution, but it must be admitted that the engraver was\r\nled very far astray from his earlier works by his imitation of the German\r\nmanner. It is possible, because French engraving, at the beginning of the\r\nsixteenth century, was pulled in four directions at once, so to speak, by\r\nnational habit, by Flemish taste, by German mania, and by Italian charm.\r\nM. Bernard would give the fullest sanction to this second attribution if\r\nhe could find any evidence of a journey of Tory's to Alsace or Lorraine\r\nof a later date than his journey to Italy; the importation of woodcuts\r\nfrom those provinces, then a common occurrence, would indeed suffice, so\r\nfar as the common herd of our engravers is concerned, to explain this\r\nalteration in their manner. I will mention in a moment an example, also\r\nout of Lorraine, which must certainly have been known to Tory. Whatever\r\nthe fact may be, the Labours of Hercules deserve an honourable place\r\namong the first attempts on a large scale of French engraving, beside the\r\nplates of Jean Duvet. The British Museum, like our Cabinet des Estampes,\r\nhas acquired a set of them. Two of the plates in the latter set have the\r\nquatrains which are lacking in the corresponding ones in the Paris set;\r\nthese are, the fifth: \"The sly Archelaus 'gainst Hercules doth contend\";\r\nand the seventh: \"The mighty Geryon, despicable tyrant,\" etc.'\r\n\r\n\r\n1526\r\n\r\nI. I have said that the floriated letters of Simon de Colines and\r\nRobert Estienne were engraved by Geofroy Tory. I cannot furnish material\r\nproof of the fact with regard to those of Colines; but I am about to\r\nproduce incontestable evidence with regard to Estienne's. A letter in one\r\nof his alphabets is signed with the Lorraine cross, and that letter is\r\nthe G, the initial of Tory's own name, or, as we say to-day, his first\r\nname (_prénom_). It is as if he had written 'Geofroy Tory' in full. But\r\nin this case, in opposition to what we find in the preceding engravings,\r\nthe cross, instead of being above the G, is below it, and hidden as much\r\nas possible in order not to injure the design of the 'antique letter.'\r\nThis circumstance proves not only that Tory was the engraver of Robert\r\nEstienne's floriated letters, but also that the double cross was that\r\nartist's mark.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIs it not, in truth, a striking fact that Tory chose the letter G to place\r\nhis mark upon? He was not withheld by the consideration that that letter,\r\nnot being in very common use, especially at the beginning of words,\r\nappeared rather infrequently in books.[337] As always, logic prevailed\r\nwith him over every other consideration. Let us see how far it carried him.\r\n\r\nLater, he engraved a Greek alphabet, in the same style, for Robert\r\nEstienne; as he could not put his mark on the _gamma_, which bears no\r\nresemblance to the G, he put it on no letter, but on one of the friezes\r\nexecuted to accompany those beautiful floriated letters.[338] See the\r\nfrieze in question at the beginning of the second volume of the Works of\r\nEusebius, three volumes, folio, 1544.[339]\r\n\r\nII. Besides these two alphabets of capital letters, Tory engraved\r\nfor Robert Estienne about the same time, six different marks for his\r\ntypographical sign, the 'Olive-Tree,' of which a description will be found\r\nlater on, in section 3.\r\n\r\nIII. Tory also engraved, about the same time, for Simon de\r\nColines, a border in the criblé style, at the foot of which is a sun\r\nwhich certain centaurs, incited thereto by women, are trying to seize.\r\n(Silvestre, no. 523). This border is probably of 1526, when Colines turned\r\nover to Robert Estienne his father's establishment and set up for himself\r\nat the 'Soleil d'Or,' opposite the Collège de Beauvais. It appears, to my\r\nknowledge, in two octavo volumes of 1529: 'Compendium Grammaticæ græcæ\r\nJacobi Ceporini,' and 'Liber de opificio Dei.'\r\n\r\n\r\n1526-1528\r\n\r\nThis whole period was, in all probability, absorbed by the labour of\r\nengraving and editing 'Champ fleury.' For one of the first engravings\r\nin that book is dated 1526, and it was finished early in 1529. Although\r\nthe majority of these engravings are not signed, they must all belong to\r\nTory, at all events so far as the designs are concerned.[340] I cannot\r\nattempt to enumerate them all here, for there are more than five\r\nhundred, counting as one each of the letters in the various alphabets; but\r\nI propose to mention the more important ones. For historical information\r\nconcerning the book, I refer the reader back to what I have said thereon\r\nin the first and second parts of this volume.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe title-page is enclosed in a very pleasing border,[341] and it has\r\nmoreover an engraving of the Pot Cassé reversed.[342] On the verso are the\r\narms of France.[343]\r\n\r\nFolio 1 of text: the letter L, which I have already reproduced.[344]\r\n\r\nFolio 3 verso: the Gallic Hercules. This engraving, dated 1526, and\r\nsigned with the Lorraine cross, represents Hercules holding his club in\r\none hand and a bow in the other. He is followed by divers persons of all\r\nconditions, fastened by the ear to a chain that issues from the hero's\r\nmouth. This is an allusion to the power of eloquence over the French. The\r\nstrength of the Gallic Hercules lies not in his arms but in his mouth.[345]\r\n\r\nFolio 9 verso: cut of the _lisflambe_, a species of lily; it is the swamp\r\niris, called to-day the _iris flambe_.\r\n\r\nHere the first book ends.\r\n\r\nThe second contains thirty-seven geometrical figures, which it would be\r\nno less difficult than unprofitable to describe. They are, for the most\r\npart, representations of different letters. At the end of this book is the\r\n'Triumph of Apollo and the Muses,' 'to show that they who have knowledge\r\nof goodly letters have the advantage over the ignorant.' This engraving,\r\nwhich is in two parts,[346] both signed with the Lorraine cross (folios\r\n29 verso and 30 recto), represents Apollo in a chariot, escorted by the\r\nMuses, Liberal Arts, etc., and followed by Bacchus, Ceres and Venus as\r\nprisoners.[347]\r\n\r\nOn the very last page (folio 30 recto) is an engraving of the _lisflambe_\r\nsurmounted by an A made up of three I's.[348]\r\n\r\nThe third book has, in the first place, twenty-eight engravings of Roman\r\nletters. The twenty-ninth represents a gothic S (folio 42 verso). The\r\nthirtieth is a representation of the Pot Cassé, signed with the Lorraine\r\ncross (folio 43 verso).[349]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNext come thirty-eight other cuts of letters, and two curious drawings of\r\nthe letter Y (folio 63 recto and verso).[350] Then two ordinary copies of\r\nthe letter Z, and an allegory based on the shape of that letter (folio\r\n65).[351]\r\n\r\nOn folio 65 verso is a representation of various punctuation marks.\r\n\r\nFolios 68 verso and 69 recto: a Hebrew alphabet of forty letters or\r\nsymbols.\r\n\r\nFolio 71 recto: the Greek alphabet of twenty-four letters and three\r\naccents.[352]\r\n\r\nFolio 72 recto: the Latin alphabet[353] of twenty-three letters, with\r\nthree punctuation marks, and the Greek abbreviation of the name of Jesus.\r\n\r\nFolio 74 recto: the alphabet of _cadeaulx_ letters, consisting of\r\ntwenty-three letters and one mark.\r\n\r\nFolio 74 verso: the alphabet of letters _de forme_, consisting of\r\ntwenty-nine letters or symbols, with two lines of text added.\r\n\r\nFolio 75 recto: the alphabet of _bastardes_ letters, consisting of\r\ntwenty-eight letters or symbols, followed by two lines of text.\r\n\r\nFolio 75 verso: the alphabet of _tourneures_ letters, consisting of\r\ntwenty-three letters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFolio 76 recto: the alphabet of Persian, Arabic, African, Turkish and\r\nTartar letters, thirty in all.\r\n\r\nFolio 76 verso: the alphabet of Chaldæan letters, consisting of\r\ntwenty-three.\r\n\r\nFolio 77 recto: the alphabet of _goffes_ letters, otherwise called\r\n_imperiales_ and _bullatiques_, twenty-three in number.\r\n\r\nFolio 77 verso: the alphabet of _fantastic_ letters, to the number of\r\ntwenty-three.\r\n\r\nFolio 78 recto: the alphabet of _utopiques_ and _voluntaires_ letters, to\r\nthe number of twenty-three.\r\n\r\nFolio 78 verso: an alphabet of floriated letters used in the course of the\r\nbook, twenty-three in number.[354]\r\n\r\nFolio 79 recto: a series of ciphers or intertwined letters, to the number\r\nof ten.\r\n\r\nFolio 80 recto, and last: a border of graceful design,[355] in which occur\r\nTory's mottoes: 'Menti bonæ Deus occurrit'; 'Sic ut, vel ut'; 'Omnis\r\ntandem marcescit flos.' And in the centre is the Pot Cassé, unsigned,\r\nalthough it seems to be the same cut that appears on folio 43 verso, with\r\nthe cross removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n1527\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I.

ARISTOPHANES.\r\n\r\nIn 1528 Pierre Vidoue printed, at the expense of Gilles de Gourmont, nine\r\ncomedies of Aristophanes, in Greek, which were published separately, in\r\nquarto form, under the editorship of Jean Cheradam.[358] All of these have\r\na frontispiece engraved by Tory, of which a description follows. At the\r\nfoot, under the words 'Egidivs Gormontivs' in large letters, is a shield\r\nwith the Gourmont arms (three roses in chief and a crescent in point),\r\nsupported by two winged stags with ducal coronets about their necks,\r\nthe crest being a helmet above which is a St. Michael holding a naked\r\nsword.[359] At the left, a Greek inscription; at the right, an inscription\r\nin Hebrew. The two uprights represent the wise men offering their gifts to\r\nthe Child Jesus lying on his mother's knees. At the top is a shield with\r\nthree crowns in chief (this was the sign of Gilles de Gourmont, as may be\r\nseen on the title-page of 'Champ fleury'), and tears in the field. This\r\nshield has for supporters, on the right a lion, on the left a griffin,\r\nand for crest a helmet surmounted by a fan-shaped ornament. On either\r\nside is an angel with wings holding a shield; that on the left enclosing\r\nan E, that on the right a G, the initials of Gilles de Gourmont's name\r\nin Latin (Egidius Gourmontius). The Lorraine cross is at the foot of the\r\nborder, on the left.[360]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    II.

Parisiis ex officina librarie vidue\r\n    spectabilis viri Thielmanni.\r\n\r\nSmall octavo, Paris, 1528, with engravings signed with the Lorraine\r\ncross.[361] Printed in red and black, in gothic type. There are 31\r\nsignatures of 8 leaves,--_a_ to _z_, and A to G (signatures _x_ and _y_\r\nhave only four leaves each). In all there are 232 numbered leaves, plus 4\r\nleaves of index not numbered.\r\n\r\nThe volume begins with the title-page, followed by a calendar, the whole\r\noccupying 13 leaves, after which comes the text. It contains 54 engraved\r\nplates, 12 of which are in the calendar, and a large number of initial\r\nletters representing sacred subjects. Beneath each plate is a quatrain in\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nThe 12 plates in the calendar represent allegorical subjects. They are\r\nenclosed in oval borders, and are 71 millimetres by 55. Consequently they\r\nare all out of proportion to the size of the book, which is 84 millimetres\r\nby 48. It is evident therefore that they were not made for it. At the foot\r\nof each, in the border, is the name of the month. The engraving for the\r\nmonth of February represents a school; that for March, a hunt; that for\r\nApril, a gentleman and lady, walking in the country, arm in arm; that for\r\nJuly, a domestic interior. The last is the only one of these engravings\r\nthat I have seen, and that only in a copy. The Lorraine cross may be seen\r\nat the foot.\r\n\r\nHere follows a list of the other engravings of this priceless volume, of\r\nwhich only a single copy is known to exist. It is to be observed that the\r\npages on which they appear are not numbered, as the cuts occupy the whole\r\nspace.\r\n\r\n     1. The Trinity.\r\n     2. The Annunciation.\r\n     3.

ENCOMIUM TRIUM MARIARUM, etc., JOANNIS\r\n    BERTAUDI.\r\n\r\nQuarto, Paris, Josse Bade, 1529.\r\n\r\nThe Bibliothèque Mazarine has two copies of this priceless volume, one\r\non paper, the other on vellum, which differ slightly in respect to\r\nthe title-page. The one on vellum reads: 'Encomium Joannis Bertaudi\r\nPetragorici Turrisalbæ in ducatu Engolismensi alumni, de cultu trium\r\nMariarum adversus Lutheranos, cum missa solemniore et officio canonico\r\nearundem, auspiciis augustissimæ principis Joannæ, Aurelianensis,\r\nGyveriensium dominæ ac comitis de Barcq.' This is followed by a large\r\nplate signed with the Lorraine cross, and representing the three Maries,\r\netc. There is no publisher's name; nothing but Josse Bade's mark at the\r\nend of the book.\r\n\r\nThe title-page of the copy on paper reads: 'Encomium trium Mariarum\r\ncum earumdem cultus defensione adversus Lutheranos, solemnique missa\r\net officio canonico, in quibus omnibus desideres nihil, emissum opera\r\net industria Joannis Bertaudi Petragorici, utriusque juris licentiati,\r\nTurrisque Albæ in ducatu Engolismensi alumni, auspiciis augustissimæ\r\nprincipis Joannæ Aurelianensis, Gyveriensium dominæ ac comitis de Barcq.'\r\nThen follows Josse Bade's mark: 'Prelum Ascensianum,' taking the place of\r\nthe engraving of the three Maries. And below, 'Venundatur Jodoco Badio et\r\nGaleoto a Pratis.'\r\n\r\nThis difference is explained by the fact that the copies on vellum were\r\nnot intended for sale, so that no bookseller's name was placed on them,\r\nand, furthermore, they were embellished with the cut of the three Maries.\r\n\r\nThis volume contains three short productions by Jean Bertaud, all directed\r\nto the same end--the defence of the worship of the three Maries.\r\n\r\nThey are entitled:\r\n\r\n(1) Encomium trium Mariarum. (2) Officium trium filiarum beatæ Annæ. (3)\r\nDe cognatione sacerrimi Joannis Baptistæ.\r\n\r\nThere are some twenty engravings, but none of them are signed except that\r\nof the three Maries. And, as Josse Bade was an old printer, who had no\r\nknown relations with Tory, we may assume that these engravings are not by\r\nour artist. At most, we may attribute to him the shield of Orléans, at\r\npage 4 of the first work.\r\n\r\n\r\n    II. HOURS OF THE VIRGIN (sixteenmo), in Latin,\r\n    published by Tory, for himself.[363]\r\n\r\n    III.

ÆDILOQUIUM ... Item: EPITAPHIA SEPTEM DE\r\n    AMORUM ALIQUOT PASSIONIBUS, etc.\r\n\r\nOctavo, Simon de Colines, 1530.\r\n\r\nThis little book is enriched by eight engravings: a frontispiece borrowed\r\nfrom the octavo Hours of 1527, and seven small subjects corresponding to\r\nthe seven epitaphs. The latter are certainly Tory's, although not signed.\r\nThey are:--\r\n\r\n    1. Two hearts pierced by an arrow.\r\n    2. Two hearts in a circle.\r\n    3. Two hearts bound together by cords.\r\n    4. Two hearts in a boat.\r\n    5. A pig sniffing at two hearts.\r\n    6. Two hearts, a distaff, etc.\r\n    7. Two hearts being kicked by a horse.\r\n\r\nSee, for other details, what I have said of this book on pages 92 and 93.\r\n\r\n\r\n1530-1531\r\n\r\nQueen Eléonore's CORONATION and ENTRÉE, and the\r\nEPITAPHS of the Queen-Mother, Louise de Savoie:--three quarto\r\nbrochures, of which I have spoken on pages 130 to 134; a description of\r\nthe engravings follows.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I. THE CONSECRATION AND CORONATION OF THE QUEEN;\r\n    three sheets, quarto.\r\n\r\nOn the first page, a border, with the word 'Salus' at the foot; the\r\nprivilege is on the verso. The text begins on the second leaf, with the\r\nletter L reproduced on page 1. On the last page is another border, with\r\nthe word 'Salus,' and the date of printing, March 16, 1530, old style.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    II.

On page A ij recto, another border\r\nand an ornamental letter R, after the style of the L in the work last\r\ndescribed. A iiij recto, another border. B iij recto, a border, with the\r\nmotto 'non plus' at the top. B viij verso, another border, with the word\r\n'Salus' at the foot; this is identical with that of the last page of the\r\n'Coronation.' E viij recto, another border. F i verso, a lovely drawing of\r\na 'present made to the queen, of two candlesticks.' On the last page the\r\nborder of the last page of 'Champ fleury,' and the date of the printing,\r\nTuesday, May 9, 1531.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    III.

Last page, the border\r\nof the last page of 'Champ fleury' and the Pot Cassé of the first page;\r\nalso the date of printing, October 17, 1531. In all three we find the\r\ndecorated letters of 'Champ fleury.'\r\n\r\nThese three brochures, bound together in a small volume, are in the\r\nBibliothèque de l'Arsenal. The borders used in them reappear later as\r\nframes for the engravings of a book of Hours, quarto, printed in roman\r\ntype, in red and black, of which I know neither date nor place of printing\r\nnor name of printer, as I have seen nothing except a few leaves of the\r\nbook, preserved at the Bibliothèque Nationale, with the works of Tory.\r\n\r\n\r\n1531\r\n\r\n    I.

The motto is: 'Utinam novissima providerent.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    IV. CLAUDII GALENI PERGAMENI DE ANATOMICIS\r\n    ADMINISTRATIONIBUS LIBRI NOVEM, JOANNE GUNTERIO ANDERNACO, MEDICO,\r\n    INTERPRETE.--Parisiis, apud Simonem Colinæum, 1531.\r\n\r\nLarge folio, with an engraved frontispiece having the Lorraine cross at\r\nthe foot, on the left.\r\n\r\nThe frontispiece represents several different subjects. At the top is\r\nJesus healing the leper; at the foot, doctors dissecting a dead body and\r\nlecturing to a numerous audience; at the sides, full-length portraits of\r\nthe most celebrated physicians of antiquity; in the centre of the plate is\r\na scroll bearing the Latin title transcribed above. This frontispiece was,\r\ndoubtless, used with others of the works of Galen.\r\n\r\nSimon de Colines also published, in 1536, an edition of the works of\r\nGalen, under the supervision of the same editor (folio of 172 pages), and\r\nembellished with five beautiful floriated letters engraved by Tory. In it\r\nwe find also, at the head of the epistle to the reader, an ornamental S\r\nsurmounted by a coat of arms,--a charming design, but not signed.\r\n\r\n\r\n1532\r\n\r\nLATIN BIBLE of 1532; folio; Robert Estienne.\r\n\r\nThe title-page is decorated with a frieze signed with the Lorraine cross,\r\nbearing the word 'Biblia' in large letters. It is a scroll surrounded by\r\nvines, with the brazen serpent at the left, and Jesus on the Cross at the\r\nright.\r\n\r\n\r\n1533\r\n\r\nThe BON MESNAGER of Pierre des Crescens, printed by Nicolas\r\nCousteau for Galliot Dupré. Folio, 1533. The frontispiece, representing\r\nDupré presenting the book to François I, is signed with the Lorraine cross.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nInasmuch as Tory died in 1533, it will, perhaps, seem that I ought to stop\r\nhere in this enumeration. But as many engravings executed by his own hand\r\nwere not printed until later, and, moreover, as those signed with the\r\nLorraine cross alone came from his establishment, which was managed by\r\nhis wife after his death, I have thought best to pursue my investigations\r\nconcerning the engravings with the Lorraine cross to the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n1534\r\n\r\n    I. SERMONES IUDOCI CLICHTOVEI NEOPORTUEN. DOCTORIS\r\n    THEOLOGI ET CARNOTEN. CANONICI.\r\n\r\nFolio, Paris, Thielman Kerver's widow, 1534. The privilege is dated 1534.\r\n(Bibliothèque S.-Geneviève, and Bibliothèque Mazarine.)\r\n\r\nThe Latin title which I have transcribed is engraved in great gothic\r\nletters, arranged in the shape of a cul-de-lampe, and terminated by a\r\nsmall black heart-shaped ornament (not unlike those used by Simon de\r\nColines), in which is the Lorraine cross. This circumstance leads me to\r\nbelieve that Tory engraved this title-page in gothic letters; a most\r\ninteresting fact if true, for they are probably the only letters in that\r\nstyle that he ever engraved, after those on folios 42 verso, 74, etc. of\r\n'Champ fleury'; and it is all the more strange because the rest of the\r\nbook is printed in roman type. It may be that there was another edition in\r\ngothic type.\r\n\r\nHowever, this volume contains many other engravings signed with the\r\nLorraine cross, and others which, although unsigned, seem to be Tory's.\r\n\r\nFolio 1, following the title, a large T, adorned with fleurs-de-lis, on a\r\nbackground strewn with the same flowers.\r\n\r\nFolio 5 verso, a large ornamental P, representing the Eternal Father.\r\n\r\nFolio 19, the Virgin in a halo of fire, with the Child Jesus (signed).\r\n\r\nFolio 21, Jesus among the Apostles, holding a saw (signed).\r\n\r\nFolio 43, Moses receiving the Tables (signed).\r\n\r\nFolio 63 verso, the Ark in the form of a church (signed).\r\n\r\nFolio 77, the Annunciation, in an oval border (octavo).\r\n\r\nFolio 88, Birth of Jesus (small octavo).\r\n\r\nFolio 135, the Resurrection (signed).\r\n\r\nFolio 148, the Ascension (signed).\r\n\r\nFolio 154 verso, the Virgin among the Apostles (small octavo).\r\n\r\nFolio 157 verso, the Trinity (signed).\r\n\r\nFolio 161, Easter (signed).\r\n\r\nFolio 221, Birth of the Virgin. She is in her mother's womb, holding the\r\nChild Jesus (octavo).\r\n\r\nFolio 325, Jesus tempted by the Devil (octavo).\r\n\r\nThe octavo engravings appear in several other books printed by the Kervers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    II. PAULI BELMISSERI PONTREMULANI, ARTIUM ET MEDICINÆ\r\n    DOCTORIS, EQUITIS, ET POETÆ LAUREATI, OPERA POETICA.\r\n\r\nQuarto, of 108 numbered, plus 4 preliminary unnumbered leaves.\r\n\r\nPrinted in 1534, but with no name of printer or bookseller. On the\r\nfirst page is a quarto plate, representing the author crowned with\r\nlaurel, standing between François I and Clement VII. Beneath these three\r\npersonages are their respective arms, and above their heads their names:\r\nFranciscus, Paulus, Clemens. The Lorraine cross is at the foot, on the\r\nleft. The same plate appears on the last page.\r\n\r\n\r\n1535\r\n\r\n    LES TROYS PREMIERS LIVRES DE L'HISTOIRE DE DIODORE SICILIEN,\r\n    TRANSLATEZ DE LATIN EN FRANÇOYS, PAR ANT. MACAULT.... On les\r\n    vent a Paris, en la rue de la Juifverie, devant la Magdaleine, à\r\n    l'enseigne du Pot Cassé....[367]\r\n\r\nQuarto, 1535. This book is embellished with a magnificent frontispiece\r\nrepresenting Macault presenting his book to François I. Although unsigned,\r\nit is certainly Tory's.\r\n\r\n'His chef-d'œuvre,' says M. Renouvier,[368] 'is, perhaps, the frontispiece\r\nof Macault's \"Diodorus,\" in which we see François I seated in a chair\r\nwith a back carved with fleurs-de-lis, at table with his children, his\r\nmonkey, his greyhound, and his courtiers, while Macault reads his book to\r\nhim. This engraving, the authorship of which is unquestionable, does\r\nnot bear the Lorraine cross; the master published without that mark many\r\nanother work which M. Bernard, in his scrupulous exactitude, has chosen\r\nnot to mention. As some compensation for the works which I have denied\r\nto Tory, I may be allowed the pleasure of mentioning here one which M.\r\nBernard has not attributed to him: \"Les Fables d'Esopes mises en rithme\r\nfrançois,\" by Gilles Corrozet (Paris, Denys Janot, 1542). As the copy that\r\nI saw is not complete, it may be that the Lorraine cross might have been\r\nfound somewhere in the book; but, in any event, that would not change the\r\nconviction based upon examination of the plates. The small engravings,\r\nwith the first four lines of the fables, are set in borders decorated with\r\npilasters and pediments in the master's style, and illustrated at the\r\nbase with tiny drawings of amorous subjects, treated with his somewhat\r\nheavy-handed delicacy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n'There came from Tory's establishment, in the later years, many engravings\r\nof blended types which can be attributed to none but pupils, or even\r\napprentices; analysis will always be impossible; when we have cast a light\r\nupon the head of a school, we must leave the tail to languish in the\r\nshadow. I will mention here, however, one pupil of Geofroy Tory, whom M.\r\nBernard does not mention, namely, François Gryphe, brother of Sébastien\r\nGryphe of Lyon. He engraved and printed, in 1539, a New Testament which,\r\nas very rarely happens, mentions the engraver of the plates on the\r\ntitle-page as well as in the privileges from the King and the Parliament\r\nwhich stand at the beginning and end of the book respectively. \"Novum\r\ntestamentum illustratum insignium rerum simulacris, cum ad veritatem\r\nhistoriæ, tum ad venustatem, singulari artificio expressis.\" (Here the\r\nmark of the griffin.) \"Excudebat Fran. Gryphius, AN. MDXXXIX.\"\r\nAnd in the privilege: \"Francoys Gryphius, bookseller, printer and\r\ntradesman, commorant in Paris ... prayed that he be permitted to cause to\r\nbe printed and sold the New Testament, illustrated by him.\"\r\n\r\n'The volume is a small octavo; the Lorraine cross does not appear, but\r\nthere is a letter L engraved by Tory, and a series of small plates\r\nexecuted with a delicacy instinct with firmness, in accordance with types,\r\nattitudes and rules which can belong to no other school than his.'[369]\r\n\r\n\r\n1536\r\n\r\n    I.

LAZARII BAYFII ANNOTATIONES, etc.\r\n\r\nQuarto, Robert Estienne, 1536.\r\n\r\nCharles Estienne, brother of the printer, who seems to have been the\r\neditor of this book, informs us, in a brief preface, that the drawings\r\nscattered through it were taken by him from ancient monuments, and\r\nespecially from marbles still extant at Rome. Several of the plates bear\r\nthe Lorraine cross, Robert Estienne's mark, on the title-page; also the\r\nengraving on page 19 of 'De re navali' (repeated on page 168), and those\r\non pages 4, 44 and 64 of 'De re vestiaria'. All the other engravings,\r\nalthough not signed, probably came from Tory's workshop. This book was\r\nreprinted by Robert Estienne, in 1549, in the same form. Here is a\r\nsummarized list of the engravings contained in it: In the first part, 'De\r\nre navali,' are some twenty representations of antique vessels, biremes,\r\ntriremes, etc., of which one is signed; in the second part, 'De re\r\nvestiaria,' three are signed: (1) a woman; (2) a man; (3) a soldier; in\r\nthe third part, 'De vasculis,' are eight or ten representations of vases,\r\netc., not signed.\r\n\r\nAll these engravings were reproduced on copper in a reprint of Baïf's\r\nwork, published in Grævius's great collection called the 'Treasure of\r\nAntiquities,'[371] and, strangely enough, the artist has left the Lorraine\r\ncross on the first.[372] This mark appears again in column 1100 of the\r\nsame volume, in an analogous work by another author. The same engraving\r\nwas reëngraved on copper, with the cross, for the edition of Grævius's\r\n'Thesaurus,' published at Venice in 1732, after the edition of Utrecht.\r\nThis later edition was like the earlier one, and the engraving in question\r\nappears in the same volume and same column. So that we have an engraving\r\non copper, with the Lorraine cross, executed in the eighteenth century!\r\n\r\n\r\n1536-1540\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI.

The Penance of David (signed).\r\n\r\n    14. Jesus restoring Lazarus to life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAll the pages are enclosed in borders, but the latter are of two sorts:--\r\n\r\n1. Eight complete borders, that is to say, thirty-two compartments, in\r\nsimple line-engraving as in the Hours of 1524-1525. A single one of these\r\neight is signed; but they are all by the same artist. They bear the dates\r\nof 1536, 1537, 1539, in little scrolls of the sort to which Tory was so\r\nmuch addicted. These dates preclude our attributing these engravings to\r\nhimself, but they evidently came from his establishment which was then\r\nconducted by his widow. One of these borders appears in a book published\r\nin 1542: 'Rodolphi Agricolæ ... de inventione dialectica, libri III,' etc.\r\n4to, Paris, Simon de Colines.\r\n\r\n2. There are also eight complete borders, or thirty-two compartments,\r\nengraved in black in an entirely different style, alternating with those\r\nengraved in line. [Four of them are reproduced in this volume, on the\r\npages bearing the Author's Preface.] They are in niello, are neither\r\nsigned nor dated, and I doubt whether they came from Tory's workshop,\r\nalthough we shall see that he engraved some similar ones for Jean de\r\nTournes. In any event their inclusion in this book, side by side with the\r\nborders and drawings engraved in line, seems to me in wretched taste which\r\nwould have disgusted our artist.\r\n\r\nWe find also in this book some beautiful ornamental letters in the criblé\r\nstyle, which may be Tory's.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe book was reprinted in 1549, in the same form, by Renaud and Claude\r\nChaudière, successors to Simon de Colines.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nII. In the same year 1543, Simon de Colines published another\r\nbook of Hours, octavo, which seems to be a smaller edition of the one I\r\nhave just described. Like that one, it is composed of 22 signatures, A to\r\nY.\r\n\r\nThe title-page reads: HORÆ IN LAUDEM DEI AC BEATISSIMÆ VIRGINIS MARIÆ\r\nAD USUM ROMANUM, UNA CUM CALENDARIO RECENS [_sic_] EMENDATO.\r\nThis within a portico-shaped border, at the top of which is the name\r\nSimon de Colines. At the foot of the page: 'Parisiis, apud Simonem\r\nColinæum.--1543.'\r\n\r\nAs in the quarto Hours of the same date the borders of the text pages are\r\narabesques of two styles, some in line and the others in black; and the\r\ndrawings, to the number of 13, are set in a special border. Some of these\r\nborders bear the date 1537, and one of them has the name Simon de Colines\r\nin full, which proves that the engravings were executed for him. A list of\r\nthe drawings follows; only one of them is signed, but all seem to be the\r\nwork of Tory.\r\n\r\n    1. St. John writing his Gospel (signed).\r\n\r\n    2. Calvary.\r\n\r\n    3. The Salutation.\r\n\r\n    4. The Visitation.\r\n\r\n    5. The Nativity.\r\n\r\n    6. The Annunciation to the Shepherds.\r\n\r\n    7. The Adoration of the Magi.\r\n\r\n    8. The Presentation.\r\n\r\n    9. The Flight into Egypt.\r\n\r\n    10. The Coronation of the Virgin.\r\n\r\n    11. Pentecost.\r\n\r\n    12. Bathsheba at the Bath.\r\n\r\n    13. Job on the Dunghill.\r\n\r\nThe only copy of this book that I know of formerly belonged to the late\r\nM. Renouvier, of Montpellier, who showed it to me in 1858. It lacks ten\r\nleaves immediately following the title-page, which leaves undoubtedly\r\ncontained the calendar.\r\n\r\n\r\n1537\r\n\r\nI. LES ANGOISSES ET REMEDES DAMOUR DU TRAVERSEUR EN SON\r\nADOLESCENCE (Jean Bouchet).\r\n\r\nQuarto, gothic type, printed at Poitiers, January 8, 1536 (1537, new\r\nstyle), by Jean and Engilbert de Marnef. The privilege is dated November\r\n15, 1536.\r\n\r\nThere are two woodcuts signed with the Lorraine cross: the printers' mark,\r\non the first page; and, at the end of the preliminary pages, an engraving\r\nrepresenting a man in a long robe engaged in writing; facing him and below\r\nhim are four persons, also in robes, from whom he is apparently deriving\r\nhis inspiration. Near these latter, at the left, is a woman holding a\r\nlight.[373]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    II. LE JUGEMENT POETIC DE L'HONNEUR FEMININ ...

This volume,\r\nwhich is arranged like that last described, contains eleven engravings,\r\nfive of which are signed with the double cross.\r\n\r\nFolio A 5 verso. A large plate representing the author presenting his book\r\nto François I. The King is seated on his throne and surrounded by his\r\ncourt. (Signed at the left.)\r\n\r\nFolio B 1 recto.

(Not signed.)\r\n\r\nFolio L 8 verso. A winged personage, wrapped in a cloak, and having eyes\r\nin his hands and feet. (Not signed.)\r\n\r\nAt the end of the volume the mark of the Marnefs. (Signed.)\r\n\r\n\r\n1538\r\n\r\nMISSAL OF PARIS, 1539; folio. The Lorraine cross on two large\r\nfolio plates, one of which, dated 1538, represents God the Father seated\r\non his throne, his head surrounded by a halo; he is dressed like the Pope;\r\nover his head, a triangular pediment. The other, not dated, represents\r\nChrist on the Cross; the Blessed Virgin and St. John are standing at his\r\nsides, and this inscription is printed in a semicircle over the cross:\r\n'Absit michi gloriari nisi in crvce D[omi]ni n[ost]ri Jesvs Christi.'\r\n\r\nThese two subjects, which are often found in collections, sometimes on\r\npaper and sometimes on vellum, sometimes black and sometimes coloured\r\n(the mark and the date very often disappear under the colours[374]),\r\nwere first printed, so far as my knowledge goes, in the Missal of Paris,\r\npublished in 1539 by Thielman Kerver's widow. There follows a description\r\nof this priceless volume, of which I know but one copy in Paris.[375] It\r\nis entitled: 'Missale ad usum Ecclesiæ Parisiensis, noviter impressum,\r\net emendatum per deputatos a reverendissimo domino Johanne de Bellayo,\r\nParisiensi episcopo,' etc. Then comes Thielman Kerver's usual mark, and\r\nbelow: 'Prostat Parisiis in vico divi Jacobi, apud Iolandam Bonhomme,\r\nvidue spectati viri Thielmanni Kerver, ad signum Unicornis, ubi et excusum\r\nfuit, anno Domini M. D. XXXIX.'\r\n\r\nThis work makes a large folio volume, printed in red and black, in gothic\r\ntype, with a large number of unsigned engravings in the text. These\r\nengravings are of three sorts,--(1) floriated letters on a black ground;\r\n(2) small drawings of the same size, but of a very graceful renaissance\r\ntype; (3) drawings of octavo size, which were commonly used by Thielman\r\nKerver's widow in the books of Hours published by her, and of which I have\r\nalready had occasion to speak.[376]\r\n\r\nThe two large drawings signed with the Lorraine cross face each other\r\nin signature V, in the second part of the book, where the pagination is\r\ndiscontinued. They have been reprinted several times in other editions\r\nof the same book. I will mention particularly the edition, undated,\r\npublished in the name of Guillaume Merlin, bookseller, a copy of which\r\nis in the Bibliothèque Mazarine[377]; that of 1543, at the Bibliothèque\r\nSainte-Geneviève; that of 1559 (all published by Iolande Bonhomme or her\r\nson Jacques Kerver); and lastly a Missal of Cluny, of which I shall speak\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nAlthough these books are printed on paper, the plates in question are\r\nalways printed on vellum in editions of the sixteenth century; but this\r\nprecaution was neglected in later centuries.\r\n\r\n\r\n1538-1540\r\n\r\nLatin Bible in two folio volumes, bearing the dates 1538, 1539, 1540.\r\nParis, Robert Estienne. The word 'Biblia' appears on the title-page in\r\na scroll signed with the Lorraine cross, of which I have already had\r\noccasion to speak, under the date of 1532, and which appears in others of\r\nRobert Estienne's books.[378] The second title follows: 'Hebræa, chaldæa,\r\ngræca et latina nomina ... restituta cum latina interpretatione.' This\r\nhas led some bibliographers to assume, erroneously, that the book was a\r\npolyglot affair. It is printed throughout in Latin; there are simply a few\r\nHebrew words in the dissertation to which the second title in question\r\napplies, and which is printed in the second volume, with a title-page\r\nof its own, dated 1538. The New Testament, also in the second volume,\r\nis dated 1539, not 1540, as M. Renouard mistakenly says.[379] The Bible\r\nalone, that is to say, the first volume and the beginning of the second,\r\nbears the date 1540. In each part we find Robert Estienne's large mark,\r\nsigned with the Lorraine cross. The first volume contains also eighteen\r\nmagnificent engravings representing the Tabernacle of Moses, Solomon's\r\nTemple, etc., executed under the direction of François Vatable, Royal\r\nProfessor of Hebrew Literature. The Lorraine cross appears on the large\r\nplate of the camp of the Israelites, on folio 35; but I dare not upon\r\nthis evidence alone attribute all the other engravings to Tory.[380] In\r\nany event the floriated letters used in the book are certainly Tory's,\r\nfor we find the designs mentioned by him in his 'Champ fleury.' It is a\r\nfact worth noting that these letters seem to have been cast, or, at least,\r\nreproduced by stereotyping, for they are often repeated on the same page,\r\nwithout the slightest change in the design.\r\n\r\nThe Bibliothèque Nationale has a superb copy of this book on vellum, with\r\nthe arms of François I. It was reprinted in the same shape by Robert\r\nEstienne in 1546, and by his son Henri in 1565. In this last edition,\r\nprinted at Geneva, we no longer find the two small drawings which appear,\r\nwith the frieze, on the title-page of the edition of 1532. (See p. 204,\r\nsupra.) The frieze in this later form appears in other books of the\r\nEstiennes. I have seen it in a folio Xenophon printed for Fugger.\r\n\r\n\r\n1540-1548\r\n\r\nAMADIS DE GAULE, French translation by Nic. de Herberay, Seigneur\r\ndes Essarts, for the first eight books; first edition printed between 1540\r\nand 1548, by Denis Janot, for the booksellers, Vincent Sertenas, Estienne\r\nGroullau, and Jean Longis. Folio, with engravings.\r\n\r\nI have seen only two of these engravings signed with the Lorraine cross,\r\nbut several others seem to have come from the same workshop. The great\r\nmajority of them, however, are of another _make_. The two that are signed\r\nare: (1) Book II, chap. 2, a large plate representing a sort of\r\ntemple. A man armed cap-à-pie under a portico. At the right are shields\r\nhanging upon posts; at the left, a man kneeling on the ground, holding a\r\nnaked sword in the air with his right hand, and another hand grasping it.\r\nThis represents a scene from the 'Île Ferme.' (2) Book VI, chap.\r\n56, a small plate representing four persons on horseback near a château\r\nin front of which stands an armed man. This cut does not seem to have any\r\nconnection with the subject, and may well have been taken from another\r\nolder work.\r\n\r\nThere is a copy of this book on vellum in the Bibliothèque Nationale.\r\n\r\n\r\n1541\r\n\r\n    I. PRAXIS CRIMINIS PERSEQUENDI, ELEGANTIBUS ALIQUOT\r\n    FIGURIS ILLUSTRATA, JOANNE MILLÆO ... AUCTORE.\r\n\r\nFolio; Paris, Simon de Colines, 1541. Some copies have on the title-page\r\nonly the names of the brothers Arnould and Charles les Angeliers.\r\n(Bibliothèque Nationale.)\r\n\r\nThere are in this book thirteen large folio cuts, besides the\r\nfrontispiece. A single one, the seventh, is signed, but all are by the\r\nsame hand. Following is a description of them, or, rather, a brief list;\r\nfor a description would lead us into too minute details:[381]--\r\n\r\n1. Several men slain in divers ways, on a public square where there is a\r\nlarge crucifix.\r\n\r\n2. Examination of the bodies of the wounded lying in a room.\r\n\r\n3. Examination of the witnesses.\r\n\r\n4. The accused summoned by public outcry.\r\n\r\n5. Arrest of the accused.\r\n\r\n6. Examination of the accused.\r\n\r\n7. Confrontation of the witnesses with the accused (signed).\r\n\r\n8. Ratification of decree of pardon.\r\n\r\n9. Torture by water.\r\n\r\n10. Torture by the boots.\r\n\r\n11. Torture by compressing the wrists.\r\n\r\n12. Condemnation of the guilty.\r\n\r\n13. Execution of the guilty.\r\n\r\nThere is at the Bibliothèque Nationale a magnificent copy of this book\r\non vellum, with the arms of France in miniature on the verso of the\r\ntitle-page.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nII. The first volume of the CATHOLIQUES ŒUVRES ET ACTES\r\nDES APOSTRES, by Simon de Greban; followed by the MYSTERE DE\r\nL'APOCALYPSE, by Louis Choquet. Printed for Arnould and Charles les\r\nAngeliers, May 27, 1541. 'On les vend en la grand salle du Palais, par\r\nArnould et Charles les Angeliers freres.' Folio; Paris, 1541.\r\n\r\nThis work is embellished with engravings, of which only one is signed\r\nwith the Lorraine cross. This one, which is on folio I recto of\r\nthe Acts of the Apostles, represents the descent of the Holy Ghost upon\r\nthe Apostles. It is enclosed in a border, of octavo size, and belongs to\r\na series of engravings for a book of Hours published by Guillaume Merlin\r\nin 1548.[382] The engraver's mark is in a small circle at the left of the\r\nfoot of the border. Beside it is an angel holding two shields in which are\r\nthe letters G. M. (Guillaume Merlin). The frontispiece of the Acts of the\r\nApostles has a border in which is the date 1537. The same border surrounds\r\nthe frontispiece of the Mystery of the Apocalypse, but there it is without\r\nthe date. This last-named portion of the volume contains 13 engravings\r\nand a border, in Tory's style, but without the Lorraine cross. One of them\r\nbears the letters P. R. There is a copy at the Bibliothèque Nationale.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    III. HOURS OF THE VIRGIN, octavo, in roman type,\r\n    but with the borders 'à la moderne' described on page 128, supra.\r\n\r\nThis book, printed by Olivier Mallard in 1541, was copied doubtless from\r\nthe edition made by Tory about 1531, which I have been unable to examine.\r\nMallard's edition, of which I have seen a copy on vellum, belonging to\r\nM. Émilien Cabuchet, the painter, and another on paper, consists of\r\ntwenty-three octavo signatures, A to Y. The title-page reads; HORÆ\r\nIN LAUDEM BEATISSIM. VIRGINIS MARIÆ, AD USUM ROMANUM. (Here the Pot\r\nCassé.) Parisiis, apud Oliverium Mallardum, sub signo Vasis Effracti,\r\n1541. The last page, on which is printed a curious 'prescription against\r\nthe plague,' ends thus: 'Excudebat Parisiis Oliverius Mallard, bibliopola\r\nregius, sub signo Vasis Effracti.'...\r\n\r\nIn this edition there are 16 different borders; each leaf has the same\r\nborder on both recto and verso. There are also 16 of the engravings of the\r\nsixteenmo Hours of 1529, those not reproduced being nos. 1, 19 and 21 of\r\nthat edition.\r\n\r\nThe word 'Rom.' printed on the first page of each signature leads me to\r\nbelieve that Mallard published at the same time, in the same format, an\r\nedition of Hours 'ad usum Parisianum,' but I have found no trace of such\r\nan edition.\r\n\r\nAfter Olivier Mallard's death, which occurred, as I have said heretofore,\r\nin 1542, his typographical outfit seems to have been acquired by Thielman\r\nKerver II (son of the first Thielman and Iolande Bonhomme, who lived, as\r\ndid his father before him, on Rue Saint-Jacques); for he published in 1550\r\na book of Hours similar to that printed in 1541 by Mallard. It contains\r\nthe same borders and the same drawings, but in a different arrangement.\r\nThe borders have been lengthened by means of a most ungraceful addition\r\nto the side-pieces; as for the drawings in two parts, no pains has been\r\ntaken to place the parts facing each other, so that their meaning would\r\nbe uncertain if we had no other editions of the engravings. In fine, this\r\nbook is very imperfect. It consists of twenty-two and a half signatures, A\r\nto Y. The title-page reads thus:--\r\n\r\nHORÆ IN LAUDEM BEATISSIMÆ VIRGINIS MARIÆ AD USUM ROMANUM. (Here\r\nthe mark of Thielman Kerver, with the Lorraine cross.) 'Parisiis, apud\r\nThielmannum Kerver, vico sancti Jacobi, sub signo Cratis. M.D.L.' The\r\nbook closes with the curious 'prescription' found in Olivier Mallard's\r\nedition of 1541, which is in these words: 'Approbatissima medicina contra\r\npestem.--Recipe quantum potes de amaritudine mentis contra peccata\r\ncommissa, cum vera cordis contritione, potius libram quam unciam. Hæc\r\nmisceantur cum aqua lacrymarum, et facies vomitum per puram confessionem.\r\nDeinde sumas illud sacratiss. electuarium corporis Christi, et tutus eris\r\na peste.'\r\n\r\nThe book is printed in red and black. I have seen a copy on paper at\r\nM. Potier's bookshop. There is an imperfect copy at the Bibliothèque\r\nMazarine, and a perfect one at Sainte-Geneviève.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time there was published a small duodecimo volume of four\r\nsignatures, in French, with the same borders. It begins thus: 'Here\r\nfollows the method of receiving the blessed sacrament devoutly.' It is\r\nlike the book last-described except that it is printed in only one colour,\r\nand that it is a little longer and wider.[383] To lengthen the borders,\r\nsections have been added to them. It is most peculiar that a duodecimo\r\nvolume should be larger than an octavo, but the fact is unquestionable:\r\nformats were already beginning to increase in size. Near the end of the\r\nbook is a little treatise with this heading: 'Here follows a devout\r\nmeditation as to the manner in which thou shouldst ordain and arrange the\r\nwhole day,' etc. And after that: 'The life of Madame Sainte-Marguerite,\r\nwith prayer to be said for women pregnant and in travail.'\r\n\r\nThis book is in the Bibliothèque Mazarine, in the same collection as the\r\nlast. It contains four small engravings, of which only one seems to me to\r\nbelong to Tory: it is the Christ on the Cross, which appears in the quarto\r\nHours of 1542, now to be described.\r\n\r\n\r\n1542\r\n\r\nI. Hours, according to the Roman use, quarto, in Latin, published\r\nby Olivier Mallard in 1542. This rare volume, of which I know only one\r\ncopy, belonging to M. Aerts, of Metz,[384] who himself kindly brought it\r\nto me at Paris, is a reproduction of the Hours printed by Tory in 1531;\r\nthe type, however, is smaller. It consists of nineteen signatures of\r\ntwo quarto sheets _encartées_, signatures A to T. The title-page reads:\r\nHORAE IN LAUDEM BEATISS. VIRGINIS MARIÆ AD USUM ROMANUM. OFFICIUM\r\nTRIPLEX.--Parrhisiis, apud Oliverium Mallard, impressorem Regium.\r\nThe rest is as in the edition of 1531. On the last page: 'Parrhisiis, ex\r\nofficina Oliverii Mallard, Regii impressoris, Ad insigna Vasis Effracti.\r\nAnno salu. M. D. XLII. Mense Augusti.' Then come the two lines:--\r\n\r\n    'Effracti, lector, subeas insignia vasis,\r\n      Egregios flores ut tibi habere queis.'\r\n\r\nThe table of Easter-Days, on the verso of the title-page, goes from 1542\r\nto 1571; then comes the calendar, in which the order of the edition of\r\n1531 has been followed in the arrangement of the borders, although the\r\ntype, being smaller, would have permitted the more regular arrangement of\r\nthe edition of 1524-25.\r\n\r\nThe book is printed in two colours, except signatures B, C, and D, which\r\nare in black only--a most unusual state of things. The engravings are\r\nthe same as those of the edition of 1531, but the floriated letters are\r\ndifferent. The Passion, which begins on folio B 3 verso, is enriched by\r\nthe small Christ on the Cross which we find in the Hours of 1529, but\r\nwithout the four additional subjects (bees, etc.), which there accompany\r\nit.[385] It is probable that some accident happened to the plate, and that\r\nonly the Christ was saved. We find also in this volume, at the foot of the\r\nborder, the crowned C of Queen Claude of France, who had then been dead\r\nabout fifteen years.\r\n\r\nThe Lorraine cross, which had disappeared from several of the larger\r\nengravings as early as the edition of 1531, appears on almost none of them\r\nin that of 1542. For example, it has been expunged from the Birth of Jesus\r\nand the Circumcision. The only ones which retain it are the Visitation,\r\nthe Crucifixion, and the Descent of the Holy Ghost. It remains on the\r\nborders also.\r\n\r\nSignature E begins with a leaf the recto of which is blank, while on the\r\nverso is the angel of the Annunciation, as in the edition of 1531. The\r\nlarge plate, the Triumph of the Virgin Mary, is also included in this\r\nedition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    II.

It represents the Virgin standing on a\r\ncrescent, holding the child Jesus in her arms, and surrounded by a halo.\r\n(Bibliothèque Nationale.)\r\n\r\n\r\n1543-1544\r\n\r\n    SOMMAIRE DE CHRONIQUES, CONTENANS LES VIES, GESTES ET CAS\r\n    FORTUITZ DE TOUS LES EMPEREURS D'EUROPE, etc. By J. B.\r\n    Egnatius, translated by G. Tory.[386]\r\n\r\nThere were several other editions of these chronicles. M. Hippolyte\r\nBoyer mentions one of 1541, in his 'Histoire des Imprimeurs et Libraires\r\nde Bourges' (8vo, Bourges, 1854), p. 27; Antoine du Verdier, another,\r\nof 1543, in his Bibliothèque françoise. This much is certain--that M.\r\nRenouvier owned a copy, with illustrations, dated 1544. It is an octavo,\r\n'for sale by Charles l'Angelier, in the \"grand'salle du Palais.\"' It\r\ncontains 112 leaves (signatures A to O), plus 4 unnumbered leaves. The\r\nengravings are of two sorts: the first represents an emperor on horseback,\r\ncarrying a battle-axe; there is no mark, but it is engraved with much\r\ndelicacy and distinguished by the little cartouches of which Tory was so\r\nfond; this figure is reproduced several times. The others are busts of\r\nemperors, roughly engraved, which cannot be Tory's. It may be noted that\r\nthe edition published by Tory in 1530 contains no engravings.\r\n\r\n\r\n1545\r\n\r\n    DE DISSECTIONE PARTIUM CORPORIS HUMANI, etc. By Charles\r\n    Estienne. Folio, Simon de Colines, 1545.\r\n\r\nThere are in this book about sixty large anatomical plates. Five are\r\nsigned with the Lorraine cross--folios 149, 150, 151, 154, 155. The last\r\nfour bear also the name of Jollat, with the dates 1530, 1531, 1532. Here\r\nis what M. Renouvier has to say on the subject: 'Simon de Colines ...\r\nemployed another wood-engraver of some note, Mercure Jollat, to whom\r\nPapillon attributed almost all of our gothic books of Hours. He should\r\nbe reckoned only among the engravers of an altogether modernized manner.\r\nHis name is written Iollat, the first letter in the zodiacal sign of\r\nMercury, followed by the dates 1530, 1531, and 1532, and accompanied by\r\nthe Lorraine cross, on four plates of Charles Estienne's book on the\r\ndissection of the human body, representing the cadaver in its skin and\r\nthe cadaver with the skin removed. The drawing of the figures has been\r\nattributed, even by Brulliot, to Woeiriot; but it is really the work of\r\nthe surgeon Estienne Rivière, who is named on the title-page and in the\r\npreface as the painter of the bones, ligaments, and all the anatomical\r\ndetails. His initials, S. R., appear on a tablet hanging from the branches\r\nof a tree in the first plate. The engraving, which varies considerably,\r\nwould seem to be the work of different hands, or, at least, to have come\r\nfrom an establishment which practised diverse styles and which sometimes\r\nput forth work done by apprentices. The workmanship of the plates with\r\nJollat's mark seemed to me more monotonous--not unskilful although less\r\npicturesque. I am not now passing upon their scientific merit, but upon\r\ntheir picturesque interest simply.'[387]\r\n\r\nThe inscription of Jollat's name on plates marked with the Lorraine cross\r\nseems, at first glance, quite hard to explain, especially with the general\r\nopinion concerning the former of these artists, based on Papillon's\r\nstatements. But as the story of Jollat's work as an engraver still remains\r\nto be told, I think I may safely say that he simply designed the plates\r\nthat bear his name in Charles Estienne's book, and that they were engraved\r\nby Tory, or, at least, in his workshop. We have seen, in fact, that Tory\r\nwas Simon de Colines' favourite engraver. To be sure, M. Renouvier seems\r\nto be of opinion that all the plates were designed by Estienne Rivière,\r\nwhence he concludes that the engraving is by Jollat; but this is a\r\nmistaken opinion, based on a sentence in the preface. Rivière, who was a\r\nfriend of Charles Estienne, may have designed the majority of the plates\r\nin Charles Estienne's book, and yet not have designed all of them. Those\r\nsigned Jollat evidently belong to that artist, who seems to have designed\r\na number of them before the work was placed in Rivière's hands.\r\n\r\nI am confirmed in my belief that Jollat was the designer of the plates in\r\nquestion by the fact that his name is always accompanied by the dates, and\r\nthat those dates are not those of the engraving, which I propose to prove.\r\nThere are only five plates signed with Jollat's name and with the Lorraine\r\ncross in the Latin edition of Charles Estienne's book, published by Simon\r\nde Colines in 1545. In the following year the same printer issued a French\r\nedition of this work, under the title, 'La Dissection des parties du corps\r\nhumain' (folio, 1546), in which we find two additional plates so marked\r\nand dated 1532. Why did not these plates appear in the first edition, if\r\nthey were engraved by Jollat?\r\n\r\nBut here is another fact even more conclusive. In 1575 the bookseller\r\nJacques Kerver published a volume of engravings without text, entitled\r\n'Les Figures et portraicts des parties du corps humain' (folio), in which\r\nwe find not only the seven engravings with the cross, of the edition of\r\n1546, but three others, also bearing Jollat's mark and the Lorraine cross,\r\nand dated 1533. Evidently these plates appeared in some earlier edition,\r\nunknown to me,[388] for it was not Kerver who had them engraved; he simply\r\nmade use of the woodcuts of which he had become the owner. But why did\r\nthey not appear in the edition of 1546? That is a matter easily explained.\r\n\r\nCharles Estienne informs us in the preface to his book that the printing\r\nwas well advanced in 1539, but that it was interrupted by a lawsuit. We\r\ngive his own words in the French edition of 1546: 'All of which things\r\nwere well-nigh finished in the year 1539, and almost so far as the middle\r\nof the third book printed, when, by reason of a suit that was begun, we\r\nwere forced (to your great discontent, methinks) to lay aside this work\r\nand to desist from the completion thereof; for so long that in the mean\r\ntime it has been possible for many others to invent new ideas touching\r\nthis matter, and to make use at their will of many sheets filled with our\r\nwritings; for it was not possible for the printer so closely to safeguard\r\nhis book, so long suppressed, that some persons curious to learn of novel\r\nthings might not take away some sheets, still uncorrected, and send them\r\ninto Germany.'\r\n\r\nNow let us see what was the cause of this suit. Charles Estienne does not\r\ninform us, but it has been disclosed by M. Ambroise Didot, in his 'Essai\r\nsur la Gravure.' The famous Vésale had published at Venice, in 1538,\r\nthrough the printer B. Vitalis, a treatise on anatomy, embellished with\r\nnumerous plates, which was copied in several places, and notably in Paris,\r\ndespite the privilege granted by the Republic. Later, wishing to issue a\r\nnew and improved edition of his book, Vésale applied to Oporin, professor\r\nof Greek, and printer at Basle, to whom he sent his plates, which had been\r\nengraved at Venice by Calcar, a pupil of Titian. In 1543 Oporin finished\r\nprinting this new edition, for which the author had, no doubt, obtained\r\nprivileges from various sovereigns, especially from the King of France.\r\nThis seems to be proved by the suit instituted against Charles Estienne.\r\nThat is why the latter could not publish, in his edition of 1545, all the\r\nplates which he had had made, and which appeared only at intervals as the\r\ndate of Vésale's privilege was left behind. As we have seen, he gives it\r\nto be understood in his preface that it was he who was robbed in Germany.\r\n\r\nAs this is a favourable opportunity, I will say a few words concerning\r\nJacques Kerver's publication, of which I have never seen any mention,[389]\r\nbut which is of great interest to us. It is a folio volume, containing\r\n61 large plates besides a considerable number of small ones. There is\r\nno other text than the explanations printed on the plates,[390] and a\r\nbrief note to the reader, which begins thus: 'Friend reader, seeing that\r\nmedicine is not at all essential to preserve the health and to banish all\r\ndiseases, which often, on slight occasion, assail us, and that anatomy, or\r\nthe description of the parts of the human body, mainly serves us therein,\r\nI have determined not to fail to exhibit them to you here.' We give a\r\ndescription of those plates in the book which are of interest to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Plates which appear only in Kerver's volume._\r\n\r\n1. The human body in its relation to the signs of the zodiac (folio A 2\r\nverso). This bears Jollat's name, the date 1533, and the Lorraine cross.\r\n\r\n2 and 3. The human body in its relation to the seven planets (folio A 3\r\nrecto and verso). These two bear the same marks as the preceding.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Plates which appear in the edition of 1546._\r\n\r\n4. Skeleton seen from the left side (folio 11 of the edition of 1546, and\r\nA 3 verso of that of 1575). Jollat's name, the Lorraine cross, no date.\r\n\r\n5. Skeleton seen from the right side (folio 11, 1546, folio A 5 verso,\r\n1575). Jollat's name, the date 1532, and the Lorraine cross.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Plates which appear in all three editions._\r\n\r\n6. Man flayed, front view (folio 149, 1545; folio 151, 1546; folio B 2\r\nrecto, 1575). The cross alone.\r\n\r\n7. Man flayed, right side (folio 150, 1545; folio 152, 1546; folio B 2\r\nverso, 1575). Jollat's name, the date 1532, and the Lorraine cross.\r\n\r\n8. Man flayed, rear view (folio 151, 1545; folio 153, 1546; folio B 3\r\nrecto, 1575). The same marks as in the last case.\r\n\r\n9. Man in his skin, front view (folio 154, 1545; folio 160, 1546; folio B\r\n3 verso, 1575). The same marks as in the last case.\r\n\r\n10. Man in his skin, rear view (folio 155, 1545; folio 161, 1546; folio B\r\n5 recto, 1575). The same marks, with the date 1531.\r\n\r\nMany others of the plates may belong to Tory, but as they are not marked,\r\nI shall not speak of them here.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSomething analogous to what I have just described took place with\r\nreference to the engravings of Tory's Hours. Having become the property\r\nof the Kervers, as we have seen,[391] they were used by them for a long\r\nwhile. We shall mention later the octavo Hours published by Thielman II\r\nin 1550, 1552, and 1556, in which he utilized the woodcuts of the edition\r\npublished by Olivier Mallard in 1541. His son Jacques did better than\r\nthat: in 1574 he published a large octavo edition of the Hours of the\r\nVirgin, in which he used the woodcuts of the quarto editions issued by\r\nTory himself in 1524 and 1527. As the crosses were removed in almost every\r\ninstance, one might have some right to deny their source, were not the\r\nbooks published by Tory a half century before, at our hand to demonstrate\r\nit. Jacques Kerver's book being rare, and of a date subsequent to the\r\nperiod covered by my work, it seems to me that it may be well to give a\r\nbibliographical description of it, from the copy owned by M. Chedeau,\r\nwhich M. Potier, bookseller, has kindly furnished me.\r\n\r\n'Officium beatæ Mariæ Virginis nuper reformatum et Pii V, pont.\r\nmax., jussu editum.--Apud Jacobum Kerver, via Jacobea, sub insigni\r\nUnicornis.--1574.' Large octavo, with illustrations from the quarto\r\nedition published by Tory in 1524-1525, surrounded by borders taken from\r\nTory's quarto edition of 1527, but reduced in size, mutilated, transposed,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nHere is a list of the plates:--\r\n\r\n    1. The Annunciation (two plates).\r\n    2. The Salutation.\r\n    3. The Nativity.\r\n    4. The Adoration of the Shepherds.\r\n    5. The Adoration of the Magi.\r\n    6. The Circumcision.\r\n    7. The Flight into Egypt.\r\n    8. The Coronation of the Virgin.\r\n    These eight plates are repeated three times. Then come:--\r\n    9. The Triumph of Death.\r\n    10. David's Penance.\r\n    11. Jesus on the Cross.\r\n    12. Pentecost.\r\n\r\nNumber 8 is taken from the quarto Hours of 1527; but all the others are in\r\nthe Hours of 1524-1525. Numbers 2 and 12 still bear the Lorraine cross.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt in my mind that the Kervers printed also the quarto\r\nHours (1531) which I mentioned on page 201, and in which we find the\r\nborders of the Hours of 1524-1525, and the porticoes of the opuscula of\r\n1530-1531. The plates are not signed and cannot be Tory's, but as a list\r\nof them may assist in the discovery of this edition, I will mention here\r\nthose which are at the Bibliothèque Nationale:--\r\n\r\n    1. The Annunciation.\r\n    2. The Conception.\r\n    3. The Visitation.\r\n    4. The Nativity.\r\n    5. The Circumcision.\r\n    6. The Resurrection.\r\n    7. The Descent of the Holy Ghost.\r\n    8. All Saints.\r\n    9. The Trinity.\r\n\r\n\r\n1547\r\n\r\nWe place under this date three books of Hours which introduce us to\r\ncertain engravings signed with the Lorraine cross accompanied by initials.\r\n1547 is not the exact date of the engravings to which we refer, for we\r\nshall see that they are of earlier execution; but their first appearance\r\nis so uncertain that we are forced to fall back upon the definite date\r\nsupplied by the books in question.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I. HOURS ACCORDING TO THE USE OF TOUL.\r\n\r\nOctavo. On the first page: 'The present hours according to the use of Tou\r\n[_sic_], in full, _sans requerir_, newly printed at Paris.' (Here the mark\r\nof François Regnault.) 'For sale in Paris, Rue Saint Jacques, at the sign\r\nof the Elephant, opposite the Mathurins, by Françoys Regnault's widow.'\r\n\r\nOn the verso is a table of Easter-Days for thirteen years, beginning in\r\n1547. Next comes a calendar, with engravings and verses (some in Latin,\r\nsome in French), the 'Jours moralisez,' divers moral and religious axioms,\r\nin verse and in prose, and, lastly, the four Gospels of the Passion, in\r\nLatin. All these form the first part, with a special series of signatures,\r\n_aa_ to _ee_. It is more than likely that this first part, which has no\r\napplication to any particular diocese, is printed, in the same form,\r\nin the Hours which Veuve Regnault probably printed for other churches\r\nabout the same time. In signatures _cc_ and _ee_ there is an engraving\r\nrepresenting Jesus on the Cross, signed with the letters I, L, B and the\r\nLorraine cross, which appears in several other publications of the same\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe second part of the book comprises the Hours properly so-called,\r\naccording to the ritual of the church of Toul. This part is made up of\r\neight signatures, _a_ to _h_, the word _Tou_ being printed on the first\r\npage of each sheet.\r\n\r\nThe volume contains a hundred leaves in all. In addition to the\r\nbookseller's mark and the engraving signed with the Lorraine cross, there\r\nare 55 large woodcuts, most of which are signed with the initials I, M\r\n(without the cross), a few small engravings, and a large number of letters\r\nin grisaille, but no borders.\r\n\r\nWith a copy of these Hours, which I have seen, was bound the following\r\nwork:--\r\n\r\n'The fifteen effusions of the blood of our Saviour and Redeemer Jesus\r\nChrist, by Barbe Regnault, Rue Saint Jacques, at the sign of the Elephant,\r\nopposite the Mathurins.' Eight leaves in two octavo folds, enriched with\r\nfifteen pretty woodcuts, interspersed through the text, and marked, like\r\nthe one mentioned above, which is one of them, with the letters I, L, B\r\nand the Lorraine cross.\r\n\r\nThis little volume is undated, but it is known that Barbe Regnault\r\nsucceeded her mother, Madeleine Boursette, widow of François Regnault,\r\nwho was carrying on the business as late as 1555. So that the engravings\r\nwith the initials I, L, B might be of later date than that; but we have\r\nseen that one of them had already appeared in the first part of the book;\r\ntherefore they are of earlier date than 1547.\r\n\r\nHere is a list of these engravings, which are the same ones mentioned by\r\nM. Robert-Dumesnil under date of 1599:--\r\n\r\n     1. The Circumcision.\r\n     2. Jesus in the Garden of Olives.\r\n     3. The Apprehension of Jesus.\r\n     4. Jesus Beaten with Rods.\r\n     5. Jesus before Pontius Pilate.\r\n     6. Jesus King of the Jews.\r\n     7. Jesus Bearing his Cross.\r\n     8. Jesus Stripped of his Clothing.\r\n     9. Jesus on the Cross.\r\n    10. Same subject (without initials).\r\n    11. Same subject (again without initials).\r\n    12. Same subject (with initials and without the cross).\r\n    13. Erection of the Cross.\r\n    14. Jesus between the two Thieves.\r\n    15. Same subject (without cross or initials).\r\n\r\nAll of these are 4½ centimetres high and 5 wide.\r\n\r\nThe 'Fifteen Effusions' was reprinted frequently during the sixteenth\r\ncentury, in different formats and in different type, but with the same\r\nengravings, and almost always without date, because it was added to\r\nother books. I have, however, seen one copy in large type, dated 1584\r\n(Bibliothèque Nationale). These same engravings appear, with many others,\r\nin a work entitled 'Abrégé des Méditations de la vie de Jésus-Christ';\r\noctavo, Paris, Guillaume Chaudière, 1599.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    II. HORE BEATE MARIE VIRGINIS AD USUM PARISIENSEM,\r\n    TOTALITER AD LONGUM, CUM MULTIS ORATIONIBUS ET HISTORIIS, NOVITER\r\n    IMPRESSE ET EMENDATE. (Here the Triumph of the Virgin, an old\r\n    engraving with criblé background, with legends in gothic type, which\r\n    figures in all the Hours of this period.) 'On les vend a Paris, en\r\n    la rue Sainct Jacques, par la veufve Jehan de Brie, a l'enseigne de\r\n    la Lymace, pres Sainct Yves.'\r\n\r\nOn the verso of the title, 'a calendar for XI years,' beginning\r\nwith 1548. Each month has its engraving, and the usual illustration is\r\nplaced within a circle; they are not signed.\r\n\r\nPrinted in red and black, in large gothic type, the work consists of 8\r\npreliminary leaves and 16 folios of text, signatures A to Q, with the\r\nletters _Pa_ (Paris). The folios do not begin until signature B, and\r\nrun without a break to the end of signature Q. On the last page of this\r\nsignature are these words: 'These present hours according to the use of\r\nParis, with several noble eulogies of Our Lady, have been printed by\r\nVeufve Jehan de Brye [_sic_], living on rue sainct Jacques, at the sign\r\nof the Snail, near Sainct Yves.--M. D. XLVIII.'\r\n\r\nThen follow 12 leaves of appendix, ending with a figure of the Virgin,\r\nover which are the words 'Nostre Dame de Lorette,' in roman capitals. At\r\nthe foot of the page: 'Ave Sanctissima Maria,' etc. (5 lines in gothic\r\ntype).\r\n\r\nThis curious volume is preserved in the Bibliothèque Nationale.\r\n\r\nBesides the 12 small engravings of the calendar, there are several other\r\nsmall subjects, also unsigned, and 13 large ones with the letters L, R,\r\nand the double cross. These latter, which measure 10 centimetres in height\r\nand 7 in width, are as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. St. John writing his Gospel.\r\n\r\n2. The Annunciation.\r\n\r\n3. The Visitation.\r\n\r\n4. The Crucifixion.\r\n\r\n5. The Descent of the Holy Ghost upon the Apostles (with the initials, but\r\nwithout the cross).\r\n\r\n6. The Birth of Jesus.\r\n\r\n7. The Annunciation to the Shepherds.\r\n\r\n8. The Adoration of the Magi.\r\n\r\n9. The Circumcision.\r\n\r\n10. The Coronation of the Virgin.\r\n\r\n11. The Penance of David. He is saying to the Father Eternal these words,\r\nwhich are written in a scroll: 'I who have sinned.'[392]\r\n\r\n12. The Last Judgement.[393]\r\n\r\n13. Notre-Dame de Lorette.\r\n\r\nAs I have said heretofore (supra, p. 149), the first twelve of these are\r\nimproved copies of other, unsigned engravings, belonging to Thielman\r\nKerver I, which appear in many books published by him or by his widow,\r\nIolande Bonhomme, at least as early as 1522,[394] and which we find again\r\nin the Paris missal published by their son Jacques in 1559.\r\n\r\nM. Brunet[395] suggests a very plausible theory, to the effect that the\r\nengravings signed L. R. were executed by Louis Royer, who was in fact\r\nthe first to use them, in a book of Hours entitled: 'Horæ beatæ Mariæ ad\r\nusum Rom.'; duodecimo, gothic type, with the mark of Jean de Brie, and\r\nthe following words at the foot: 'Parisiis, impressum in vico Jacobi per\r\nClaudium Chevallon, impensis Ludovici Royer, librarii Parisiensis, in\r\neodem vico commorante, ad insigne vulgariter dictum la Lymace.'\r\n\r\nThe book is not dated; but we see, on the one hand, that it was printed\r\nby Claude Chevallon, who died in 1542, and, on the other hand, that Louis\r\nRoyer, at whose expense it was printed, had succeeded Jean de Brie at the\r\nsign of the Snail. Now, the latter died about 1522; so that it was between\r\n1522 and 1542 that this book saw the light, and that the engravings with\r\nthe letters L. R. first appeared.\r\n\r\nWe know nothing of this Louis Royer, whom Lottin does not mention. Nor\r\ndo we know any more of Jean de Brie's widow, who seems to have succeeded\r\nLouis Royer. And, as if everything in this matter were fated to remain\r\nobscure, we find other octavo Hours according to the use of Rome, in\r\nFrench gothic type, undated, but with a calendar from 1568 to 1578,\r\nprinted with the same woodcuts, and for sale 'at Paris, on Rue Saint\r\nJacques, at the sign of the Snail'; with no other details. In the book we\r\nhave described we find also:--\r\n\r\n1. The Virgin and the Child Jesus (signed with the letters L. R. and the\r\ncross).\r\n\r\n2. Jesus betrayed by Judas (same marks).\r\n\r\n3. Jesus bearing his Cross (same marks).\r\n\r\n4. Jesus on the Cross (same marks).\r\n\r\n5. Jesus in the Tomb (same marks).\r\n\r\n6. The Resurrection (same marks).\r\n\r\n7. The Flight into Egypt (same marks).\r\n\r\n8. Job (unsigned).\r\n\r\n9. Jesus at Emmaüs (unsigned).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    III. HEURES EN FRANÇOYS A L'USAIGE DE ROME,\r\n    NOUVELLEMENT IMPRIMÉES À PARIS POUR GUILLAUME MERLIN. M. D.\r\n    XLVIII.\r\n\r\nOctavo, gothic type; printed in red and black. This book, which I saw at\r\nthe sale of M. Chedeau's library, is illustrated with engravings, most\r\nof them signed with the Lorraine cross, to which the initials G. M. are\r\nsometimes added. They are 8 centimetres high by 55 millimetres wide. The\r\nlist follows:--\r\n\r\n1. Saint John writing his Gospel (unsigned).\r\n\r\n2. The Annunciation (unsigned).\r\n\r\n3. The Visitation (signed with the Lorraine cross and the initials G. M.).\r\n\r\n4. The Nativity (signed with the Lorraine cross only).\r\n\r\n5. The Annunciation to the Shepherds (the cross only).\r\n\r\n6. The Adoration of the Magi (the cross only).\r\n\r\n7. The Circumcision (the cross only).\r\n\r\n8. The Flight into Egypt (unsigned).\r\n\r\n9. The Coronation of the Virgin (the cross only).\r\n\r\n10. The Descent of the Holy Ghost upon the Apostles (signed with the\r\nletters G. M. and the Lorraine cross in a small circle).\r\n\r\n11. Jesus on the Cross (the cross only).\r\n\r\n12. Bathsheba (the cross only).\r\n\r\n13. Job (the cross only).\r\n\r\nWe think that we can safely attribute the designing of these engravings to\r\nGuillaume Merlin, the publisher of this book of Hours. They must, at all\r\nevents, be much earlier than 1548, for we have already seen one of them\r\n(no. 10) in a book of 1541 (supra, p. 217).\r\n\r\nGuillaume Merlin also published about 1559 a book of Hours embellished\r\nwith engravings signed with the Lorraine cross. It is entitled: 'Heures à\r\nl'usage de Romme' [_sic_], and is undated, but has a calendar from 1559\r\nto 1570. It is a small octavo, printed in gothic characters, in red and\r\nblack. At the end are the words: 'Printed by Jean Bridier.'\r\n\r\nWe find in this volume, which was in M. Chedeau's library, 12 engravings\r\nrepresenting the twelve months of the year. Three of them are signed with\r\nthe Lorraine cross, namely, January, May and December. The others have no\r\nmark. They are 10 centimetres high by 7 wide. On folio 62 verso is the\r\nVirgin holding the Child Jesus. She is within an aureole of flames, with\r\nher feet on a crescent.\r\n\r\n\r\n1548\r\n\r\n    THEODORI BEZÆ VEZELII POEMATA. Paris, Conrad Bade, 1548.\r\n\r\nOctavo of 100 pages printed in italic type. This is the first edition of\r\nthis book and contains a portrait of Théodore de Bèze signed with the\r\nLorraine cross. It is the oldest portrait that we know. Below it are the\r\nfollowing verses, alluding to a laurel wreath which Théodore has in his\r\nhand:--\r\n\r\n    Vos docti docta præcingite tempora lauro:\r\n      Mi satis est illam uel tetigisse manu.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe inscription 'An. 29,' at the top of the portrait, indicates that it\r\nwas engraved in the same year that the book was printed; for Théodore de\r\nBèze, born at Vezelay June 24, 1519, completed his twenty-ninth year in\r\n1548, the date of the dedicatory epistle of this book, which the author\r\naddressed to his teacher, Melchior Volmar. 'Vale. Lutetiæ, VII.\r\ncal. Iul. qui dies est mihi natalis.' The mark of Conrad Bade, also signed\r\nwith the Lorraine cross, is on the first page of this book, which was\r\nfinished on July 15, 1548. 'Lutetiæ, Roberto Stephano, regio typographo,\r\net sibi, Conradus Badius excudebat, idibus Julii M. D. XLVIII.'\r\nIt was shortly after, in this same year, that Théodore de Bèze, on\r\nrecovering from a severe illness, withdrew to Geneva, and abjured 'the\r\npapacy, as he had sworn to God to do at the age of sixteen.' The portrait\r\nhas been reproduced on copper; there is a copy of the reproduction in the\r\ncollection of Tory's work at the Bibliothèque Nationale.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LVCHINVS]\r\n\r\n\r\n1549\r\n\r\n    I.

XLIX.\r\n\r\nQuarto of 199 pages. Paris, 1549. This book is a faithful copy of the\r\nmanuscript of the same work, preserved in the Bibliothèque Nationale.[396]\r\nIt is embellished with beautiful letters in grisaille with criblé\r\nbackground, and with portraits of the ten dukes of Milan who figure in\r\nthe manuscript. These portraits, all marked with the Lorraine cross,\r\nare faithful reproductions of those in the manuscript, but on a smaller\r\nscale. Following is a list of the portraits, taken by Paulus Jovius from\r\noriginals which existed in his day and of which he gives, in each case,\r\nthe place where it may be found:--\r\n\r\n1.

Philippus.\r\n\r\nThere is a French translation of this book, printed in 1552 by Charles\r\nEstienne (Robert was then in exile at Geneva), with the same plates.\r\nAs for the Latin version, it was reprinted several times, in different\r\nplaces, with engravings on copper copied from those of Robert Estienne's\r\nedition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    II. ENTRÉE DE HENRI II À PARIS.\r\n\r\nQuarto; Paris, Jacques Roffet, called 'Le Faulcheur,' 1549.\r\n\r\nThis book, of 38 leaves, consists of two parts: the 'Entrée du roi,' of\r\n28 leaves, and the 'Entrée de la reine,' in which the pagination is\r\nrepeated, but with different signatures. The privilege, dated Chantilly\r\nthe last day of March, 1548 (1549 new style), grants to Roffet the sole\r\nright to have printed and to offer for sale during one year 'the treatise\r\n_which is to be written_ concerning the recent, joyful entrée,' etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThere were two editions of this book, or, at all events, there are some\r\ncopies with additions to the second part--after folio 34. There are also\r\ncopies with the imprint of Jean Dallier. A list of the engravings follows:\r\n\r\n1. A portico, above which we see Hercules holding, bound together by\r\nthe ears (by means of a chain issuing from his mouth and representing\r\neloquence), a wood-chopper, a soldier, a priest, and a noble (folio 4).\r\nI can find no mark on this piece, but it is a reproduction of the Gallic\r\nHercules of 'Champ fleury.'\r\n\r\n2. A fountain (folio 5 verso).\r\n\r\n3. A triumphal arch surmounted by the arms of France (folio 9).\r\n\r\n4. An obelisk on a rhinoceros (folio 11). The cross is under the left foot\r\nof the rhinoceros.\r\n\r\n5. A peristyle with pillars (folio 13).\r\n\r\n6. A triumphal arch surmounted by three nude men, one of whom holds a\r\nstandard (folio 15).\r\n\r\n7. A large vaulted hall, on the ceiling of which are H's and D's (folio\r\n16). The cross is in a portico at the left.\r\n\r\n8. A mounted man, armed (folio 19). The cross is in the horse's harness,\r\non the breastplate, a little below his mouth.\r\n\r\n9. A triumphal arch, with two pillars (one on each side) surmounted by a\r\nman on horseback (folio 38). The cross is on the left-hand pillar.\r\n\r\n10. A portico with two openings, separated by a pillar against which rests\r\nthe statue of a woman standing on books (folio 39 verso).\r\n\r\n11. A large plate, representing the façade of a palace with three porticos\r\n(folio 40).\r\n\r\nOf these eleven plates only four are signed; but all of them must have\r\ncome from Tory's workshop, for the style is the same. The absence of the\r\nsignature may be explained by the haste with which the engravings were\r\nexecuted in order that they might appear at the opportune moment.\r\n\r\nI cannot refrain from quoting M. Renouvier's remarks on the engravings in\r\nthis book, which, for lack of information, he attributed to Jean Cousin.\r\n\r\n'I will, however, mention in this place the \"Entrée de Henri II à Paris\"\r\nin 1549, because it is the chef-d'œuvre of French wood-engraving, and\r\nbecause I know of no one to whom it can with more reason be attributed\r\nthan to the Sénonais master.[397] If he did not work for the court, he\r\nmay very well have been employed upon works for the city. Those which\r\nwere executed to commemorate the coronation of Queen Catherine de Medici\r\nare of a manner of composition and a style that belong only to him.\r\nThe Gallic Hercules, made in the likeness of the late King François I,\r\nwith the four estates of the realm chained to his mouth; the fountain\r\nsurmounted by statues of the Seine, the Marne, and Good Fortune; the\r\ntriumphal arch bearing a Typhis, whose face strongly resembles that of the\r\n\"rex triumphans\"; and, lastly, the figure of Lutetia nova Pandora \"clad\r\nas a nymph, with her hair falling over her shoulders and drawn about her\r\nface, kneeling on one knee with wondrous grace\"; and all the other details\r\nwhich the artist painted, as happening in the streets through which the\r\nprocession passed, and which he included by way of narrative, are in the\r\nrefined manner of the French school. The drawing is pure and full of\r\ndelicacy, and the engraving so skilfully handled that one cannot believe\r\nit to be by a different hand. It would seem that none but a sculptor\r\ncould, within such narrow limits, have set in relief those interesting\r\nfaces, designed those graceful figures, and arranged those draperies; and\r\nthat sculptor--who could it have been if not the author of the mausoleum\r\nof Admiral Chabot, the French artist who best represented the two sides\r\nof art,--detail and strength, compression and grandeur, gothicism and the\r\nRenaissance?'[398]\r\n\r\nWhile agreeing with M. Renouvier that these plates were drawn by Jean\r\nCousin, we may well, it seems to me, attribute the engraving of them to\r\nTory's workshop.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    III. HORÆ IN LAUDEM BEATISSIMÆ VIRGINIS MARIÆ, AD\r\n    USUM ROMANUM. (Here a small mark of the printer Chaudière,\r\n    representing Time, with this device, printed from type, occupying\r\n    three sides of the engraving: 'Hanc aciem | sola | retvndit\r\n    virtvs.') 'Parisiis, ex officina Reginaldi Calderii et Claudii ejus\r\n    filii.' 1549.\r\n\r\nLarge quarto, divided into signatures of two sheets, _a_ to _y_ (the _k_,\r\nprobably because that letter was lacking in the font used, is represented\r\nby an _l_ and a _z_ joined together), or 22 signatures of 8 leaves, making\r\n176 leaves; printed in red and black.\r\n\r\nThis volume corresponds in all respects with the one issued by Simon de\r\nColines in 1543[399]; but the Chaudières (Simon de Colines's successors)\r\nhave removed a French inscription which appeared below the third plate\r\n(the Angelic Salutation) in the edition of 1543; and they have removed all\r\nthe dates inscribed in the borders of that edition. These dates are: 1536,\r\nwhich appeared in large figures in a cartouche at the foot of the border\r\nof folio _b_ 4 of the edition of 1543; 1537, in a cartouche at the foot\r\nof the sixth plate (the Annunciation to the Shepherds); and 1539, in two\r\nsmall cartouches at the top of the border of folio _a_ 2; so that all the\r\ncartouches are empty in this edition of 1549.\r\n\r\nI know of only two copies of this edition, one belonging to M. Kühnholtz,\r\nthe learned librarian of the Faculty of Medicine of Montpellier, the\r\nother offered for sale at Claudin's bookshop in 1860. This last copy, in\r\na state of perfect preservation, is still in its original binding, with\r\nS's _barré_, and small tortoises (_tortues_) in wreaths of olive. These\r\nare the allusive[400] arms of the Tourteron family near Attigny. There is\r\nalso, on one of the fly-leaves at the front of the book, a large tortoise\r\ncoloured from life, on a red ground, in a green olive wreath; and at the\r\nfour corners a monogram of an I and two G's, the initials of the original\r\nowner's baptismal names. The volume afterwards belonged to J.-F. Corel du\r\nClos, priest and canon, who wrote his name on the title-page and pasted\r\nhis arms, engraved on copper, in an empty space at the foot of folio _h_ 3\r\nverso. Du Clos seems to have parted with it to the Cordeliers of Rheims,\r\nin whose library it remained doubtless until the Revolution.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    IV. PREMIER VOLUME DES ANTIQUITÉS DE LA GAULE BELGIQUE,\r\n    ROYAUME DE FRANCE, AUSTRASIE ET LORRAINE ... PAR M. RICHARD DE\r\n    WASSEBOURG, ARCHIDIACRE DE L'ÉGLISE DE VERDUN ... ACHEVÉ D'IMPRIMER\r\n    LE 13 NOVEMBRE 1549.\r\n\r\nA large folio of more than 600 leaves, printed at Paris by François\r\nGirault. The privilege, in the name of Sertenas, bookseller, is dated\r\nOctober 1, 1549. It was issued evidently while the printing was in\r\nprogress, for it is impossible that the volume was made in a month and a\r\nhalf.\r\n\r\nOn the first page is the fine frontispiece of the Dream of Poliphilus,\r\nabove which is the mark of Jacques Kerver. There is but one way to explain\r\nthis fact, and that is to assume that Kerver was the printer of the book.\r\nIt may be that there are copies in his name. In that case he may have\r\nfurnished the border, which was left in all the copies.\r\n\r\nOn the second leaf is the representation of the 'Ymage de nostre Dame de\r\nVerdun,' with the Lorraine cross. The Virgin, seated, has in her right\r\nhand a flower, and in the left the Child Jesus, holding in his left hand\r\nthe globe surmounted by a cross. The Virgin's feet rest on a winged\r\ndragon. Below her is a man kneeling, with his coat-of-arms before him.\r\nPresumably it is the author of the book.\r\n\r\nAfter folio cccli, which concludes the first volume, comes the second\r\nvolume, the pagination of which follows on. The title-page of this volume,\r\nwhile it is set in the border of the Poliphilus, differs slightly from\r\nthat of the first. It reads thus: 'Second volume des antiquités de la\r\nGaule Belgique et de plusieurs principautez contenues en icelle, extraites\r\nsoubs les vies des evesques de Verdun, par M. Richard de Wassebourg.... On\r\nles vend à Paris, en la gallerie du Palais, par Vincent Sertenas, libraire\r\naudit lieu. Et aussi, se vend en la cité de Verdun.' On the verso is the\r\nengraving described above. The Lorraine cross is under the dragon's tail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    V. GERARD D'EUPHRATE.\r\n\r\nFolio, roman type, Paris, Estienne Groulleau, 1549. There are copies also\r\nwith the imprint of Longis, and others with that of Sertenas.\r\n\r\nThis volume contains numerous engravings, large and small; but only 31 of\r\nthem are different, many being repeated once, twice, or thrice. Three are\r\nsigned with the Lorraine cross, as follows:--\r\n\r\nFolios 5 verso, 64 verso, 89 verso, and 183. Vessels manned by soldiers. A\r\nwoman stands near the shield of him who seems to be in command.[401]\r\n\r\nFolio 46. A knight armed cap-à-pie standing in the recess of a portico.\r\nHis right foot is hidden by a sort of altar whereon are the names of\r\nMadanil, Bruneo, Agradiis, and Amadis.[402]\r\n\r\nFolio 48. Bird's-eye view of a château which has been besieged, at whose\r\ngate stands a warrior accompanied by a horse and a dog; he is parleying\r\nwith the keeper of the gate, who stands at the top of the entrance tower.\r\nThis last plate is a superb folio.\r\n\r\n\r\n1550\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I.

Printed in red and black.\r\nOne of the engravings, on leaf 113, representing the Sacrifice of David,\r\nis signed with the Lorraine cross. The others are not signed, but are\r\nabsolutely in the same style; they are: the Annunciation, folio 38\r\n(repeated on 105), and the Resurrection of Lazarus, folio 133.[3]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    II.

L'HISTOIRE DE PRIMALEON DE GRECE, etc.\r\n\r\nTranslated by Vernassal. Folio, Paris, 1550.\r\n\r\nThis fine volume, printed by Pasquier Letellier for the bookseller Vincent\r\nSertenas, for whom Tory had engraved a mark, contains fifty engravings\r\nin the text. A single one is signed with the Lorraine cross: it is found\r\non folio 137 verso, and represents a lion fawning upon a woman who sits\r\nbeside a fountain.\r\n\r\nThere are copies of this book in the names of other booksellers--Étienne\r\nGroulleau, Jean Longis, etc.; but the privilege is in the name of\r\nSertenas.[404] At the end of the volume is a note to the reader by\r\nLetellier. 'Dear reader,' he says, 'if you have noticed, on reading this\r\nbook, the common orthography changed in some words, even as to the double\r\nletter, which is not pronounced according to the true French method,\r\nthink not that that is of my doing, but that it accords with the earnest\r\nrecommendation of the author.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    IV.

M. CCCCC.\r\n    L.'\r\n\r\nThis missal is embellished, on the title-page, with a cut signed with the\r\nLorraine cross, and representing Saint Peter and Saint Paul, patron saints\r\nof the Abbey of Cluny. This cut appears in other parts of the book, where\r\nwe find also the two large cuts hitherto described (page 214) as included\r\nin the Missal of Paris, of 1539, published by order of Jean de Bellay. We\r\nfind also a Saint John Baptist, with the Paschal Lamb under his left arm,\r\nand pointing to it with his right hand. This cut, which is signed in two\r\ndifferent places, is on folio 49 of the second part. It is of quarto size.\r\n\r\nThe book is in two parts, paged separately. The two large engravings are\r\non folios 116 and 117 of the first part. At the end of the Missal proper,\r\nwhich is followed by a few other leaves, are these words: 'Ex officina\r\nchalcographica matrone clarissime Iolande Bonhomme, vidue industrii\r\nviri Thielmanni Kerver, Parisiis, in via Jacobea, sub Unicorni, anno D.\r\nmillesimo quingentesimo quinquagesimo, idib. septembris.'\r\n\r\nThere are several copies of this book in the Bibliothèque Nationale. In\r\ntwo of them the miniaturists have substituted for the date 1538, printed\r\non one of the large cuts, the dates on which they coloured it--1559 and\r\n1567, respectively. It is well to call attention to such details as these,\r\nwhich may give rise to mistakes.\r\n\r\nWe also find in the Cluny Missal the unsigned drawings to which I have\r\npreviously referred[405] and which are in the Paris Missals of 1539 and\r\n1559.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    V.

On the recto of folio 168 of the first part, at the foot, are\r\nthese words: 'Parisiis excudebat Stephanus Mesviere in ædibus Vindocimis,\r\nex adverso collegii Becodiani.--1550.'

This letter, dated Paris, the Ides of June, 1550,\r\nis more properly a dedication, for in it Le Duaren mentions the death of\r\nMarguerite, which took place in 1549. He tells us, further, in the title\r\nof this epistle, that it was written before his return to Bourges, which\r\nhe had been obliged to leave in 1547, as the result of a love-affair\r\n('antequam Lutetia Parisiorum Avaricum Biturigum migrasset').[408]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    II. CICERO'S WORKS (in Latin), published by\r\n    Charles Estienne, from 1551 to 1555, in four folio volumes, usually\r\n    bound in two.\r\n\r\nThis important work is embellished with a frieze engraved for Robert\r\nEstienne, and signed with the Lorraine cross,--a frieze which appears in\r\nthe second volume of the works of Eusebius of 1544.[409] We also find\r\ntherein several floriated letters signed with the Lorraine cross.[410]\r\nThese are the E, the O, and the S of the medium alphabet,--for there\r\nare three alphabets of different sizes, all three formed by Renaissance\r\narabesques. The largest is the one used in the folio Eusebius of 1544,\r\nwhich, consequently, was engraved for Robert Estienne; but it has no\r\nsignature. The medium alphabet was, doubtless, engraved for Charles\r\nEstienne in this same year 1551, in which he began to conduct a\r\nprinting-office. I cannot say whether any other letters of this medium\r\nalphabet bore the Lorraine cross, for they do not all appear in the book,\r\nbut I am sure that the G has none. Of course, after Tory died, the artists\r\nemployed in the establishment carried on by his widow had no reason to\r\nselect the G rather than another letter.\r\n\r\nI give some details concerning this valuable edition, of which M. Didot\r\nowned a copy annotated by Henri Estienne. The text of the first volume,\r\nprinted in 1551, as stated in an imprint at the end (dated the 3d of the\r\nNones of September), exhibits one of the letters mentioned above--the S\r\n(on folios 56 and 298). This volume received later a large title-page\r\ndated 1555, and a dedication, to the Cardinal de Lorraine, also dated 1555\r\n(the 6th of the Kalends of March), on which we find the frieze of the\r\nEusebius of 1544, signed, and bearing on a medallion Fame distributing\r\nwreaths.[411] The text of the second volume, also of 1551, as I discovered\r\nfrom an incomplete copy in the library at Montbrison (it has no final\r\nimprint, but on the title-page some one has added III by hand\r\nto the original numerals M. D. LI, so that it might correspond\r\nwith the other copies), contains the three floriated letters signed with\r\nthe Lorraine cross (folios 47, 122, 230, 313, 388, 398); we find also,\r\non the title-page, dated 1554, Charles Estienne's small mark described\r\nlater.[412] The text of the third volume was probably printed in 1552, but\r\nit has no final imprint. The title-page is dated 1555; it has the small\r\nmark with the Lorraine cross. The fourth bears on the title-page the date\r\n1554, but it was not finished until 1555, as is shown by the final imprint\r\n(3d of the Kalends of March, 1555); the vignette of the title-page is\r\nunlike that in the second and third volumes, although of the same size,\r\nand has not the cross. The work did not appear until 1555, as is shown by\r\nthe date on the title-page of the first volume, on which there is another\r\nlarger mark, also without the cross.[413]\r\n\r\n\r\n1552\r\n\r\n    I.

Only the first 350 are numbered; the last 10,\r\ncontaining the index, are without folios. Printed in very small roman type.\r\n\r\nThis book contains 120 engravings inserted in the text, and serving\r\nthus 'to illustrate,' as we should say to-day, or 'to express,' as the\r\npublisher says on the title-page, the Gospels and the Apocalypse. Those\r\nrelating to the Apocalypse, 22 in number, are of earlier date than the\r\nothers, and by another hand. Of those which illustrate the Gospels, many\r\nare signed with the double cross. Although several of them relate to\r\nsubjects previously treated in the octavo Hours of 1527 and the sixteenmo\r\nHours of 1529, the engravings, while they are of nearly the same size, are\r\ndifferent none the less.

LE PREMIER LIVRE DE LA CHRONIQUE DU TRES VAILLANT\r\n    ET REDOUTÉ DOM FLORES DE GRECE. Folio, Jean Longis, 1552.\r\n\r\nThere are many engravings in this book, but only one of them is signed\r\nwith the Lorraine cross. That one is on folio 90 verso, and represents\r\nsoldiers before a tower. It is reproduced in 'L'Histoire paladine,' folio,\r\nÉtienne Groulleau, 1555, on folio 56 verso.\r\n\r\n\r\n1553\r\n\r\nRonsard's 'LES AMOURS' annotated by Marc-Antoine Muret.\r\n\r\nOctavo, printed by Maurice de la Porte's widow, 1553.[416] This edition\r\nof 'Les Amours' is embellished with a portrait of Muret, signed with the\r\nLorraine cross, and bearing the inscription 'An. XXV,' which proves that\r\nit was engraved that same year, for Muret was born in 1526.[417] This\r\nportrait reappears, but without the inscription, in several other editions\r\nof Ronsard. I will mention particularly the quarto edition of his works,\r\nissued in 1567 by Gabriel Buon, successor to Maurice de la Porte's widow,\r\nand the folio issued in 1623 by Nicolas Buon, Gabriel's son.\r\n\r\n\r\n1554\r\n\r\n    LES OBSERVATIONS DE PLUSIEURS SINGULARITEZ ET CHOSES MEMORABLES\r\n    TROUVÉES EN GRECE. By Pierre Belon. Quarto, Paris, 1554.\r\n\r\nThere were two editions of this book, printed by Benoît Prevost, for\r\nGilles Corrozet and Guillaume Cavellat, respectively, in 1553 and 1554.\r\nThe copies in Corrozet's name bear his mark, signed with the Lorraine\r\ncross. There is a portrait of Belon signed with the cross at the end of\r\nthe front matter in the edition of 1554. I have not seen it in any copy\r\nof the edition of 1553, which leads me to think that it had not then been\r\nengraved. And, in effect, the fact that the portrait attributes to Belon\r\nthe age of thirty-six years seems to show that it was not drawn until\r\n1554, as Belon is supposed to have been born in 1518. However that may be,\r\nthe portrait appeared afterward in several other books by the same author,\r\nand particularly in his 'Histoire de la nature des oiseaux,' folio, 1555.\r\n\r\n\r\n1555\r\n\r\n    HISTOIRE DE LA NATURE DES OISEAUX. By Pierre Belon. Folio,\r\n    Paris, G. Corrozet, 1555.\r\n\r\nIn this book we find, in addition to the portrait of Belon, seven cuts of\r\nbirds, signed with the Lorraine cross. They are: the osprey, folio 96; the\r\nsea-gull, 169; the bustard, 238; the pullet, 252; the loriot, 295; the\r\nwoodpecker, 304; the sparrow-hawk, 376. Some of the other engravings in\r\nthe volume are signed with a white cross on a black ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n1556\r\n\r\n    I. LES SINGULARITEZ DE LA FRANCE ANTARCTIQUE, AUTREMENT\r\n    NOMMÉE AMERIQUE, ET DE PLUSIEURS TERRES ET ISLES DECOUVERTES DE\r\n    NOSTRE TEMPS. Par F. André Thevet, natif d'Angoulesme.--A\r\n    Paris, chez les héritiers de Maurice de la Porte, au clos Bruneau, à\r\n    l'enseigne S. Claude.--1558.\r\n\r\nThis rare and curious volume is a quarto of 8 preliminary leaves, 166\r\nleaves of text, and 2 of index unnumbered,--in all, 46 signatures. The\r\nprivilege, which is printed on the verso of the title-page, is dated\r\nSaint-Germain-en-Laye, December 18, 1556. In the dedication, addressed to\r\nthe Cardinal of Sens, Jean Bertrand, first Keeper of the Seals of France,\r\nThevet says that the country described by him maybe called the fourth part\r\nof the world, 'for that no one has as yet made explorations there, all\r\ngeographers thinking that the world is limited to that which the ancients\r\nhave described to us.'\r\n\r\nThere are 41 engravings in the text, not including borders, floriated\r\nletters, and Jean Bertrand's arms on the title-page. Of the 41, only seven\r\nare signed with the double cross; four of these represent scenes in the\r\nlife of the American savage,--they are on folios 6 verso, 31 recto, 47\r\nverso, and 151 recto; a fifth represents an extraordinary bird called _pa_\r\n(45 recto); and the other two, plants,--the pineapple (89 verso), and the\r\ncassava (113 verso). The last three appear in André Thevet's 'Cosmographie\r\nUniverselle,' published in 1575, in two volumes, folio.[418] The others\r\nalso appear in that work, but reëngraved on a larger scale, and without\r\nsignature.\r\n\r\nThe seven engravings signed with the double cross cannot have been\r\nexecuted prior to 1556. For Thevet set out for the New World on November\r\n4, 1555,[419] and remained there four months. So that it was not until\r\nthe early months of 1556, at the earliest, that the engravings could have\r\nbeen executed. But, as the book did not appear until the beginning of\r\n1558,[420] it may be that they were still in process of execution in 1557.\r\n\r\nIn the same year with the publication of Thevet's 'Singularités,' an\r\noctavo edition appeared at Antwerp, with the imprint of Christophe\r\nPlantin, and a privilege from the King of Spain, dated Brussels, April 20,\r\n1558. The haste with which this reprint was prepared shows the interest\r\nwith which the book was regarded. The woodcuts of the Antwerp edition\r\nare nothing more than wretched copies of those in the Paris edition. We\r\nfind among them, however, in chapters 56, 58, 67, and 74, cuts of animals\r\nbearing the cipher of Jost Amman.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    II.

It is entitled 'De\r\nSymetria partium humanorum corporum.' I am unable to say which was printed\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n\r\n1559\r\n\r\n    PSALTERIUM DAVIDICUM GRÆCOLATINUM....

Lornier, barrister, of Rouen. Opposite the\r\nfirst page of text is a small engraving, signed with the Lorraine cross,\r\nrepresenting the penance of David. David is on his knees, with a book\r\nbefore him and his harp at his right hand; he is gazing at God the Father,\r\nwho is seen in the sky blessing him. Doubtless this engraving appears in\r\nother books of earlier date. It is 73 millimetres high by 55 wide.\r\n\r\n\r\nENGRAVINGS OF UNCERTAIN DATE.\r\n\r\n    I. FIGURE DE L'ANCIENNE ET DE LA NOUVELLE ALLIANCE.\r\n\r\nA large plate, 35 centimetres in width by 27 in height, divided into two\r\nparts by a tree at the foot of which is Man, thus placed on the boundary\r\nof the two worlds. The tree bears only withered branches on the left side\r\n(the old alliance), whereas, on the right (the new alliance), it is green\r\nand flourishing.\r\n\r\nIn the compartment at the left we see Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.\r\nEve is offering Adam the apple. Beneath them is the word 'peche.'[423]\r\nLower still is a skeleton on a bier, with the words 'la mort' beneath.\r\nAbove the Garden is Mount Sinai, whereon Moses is receiving the tables of\r\nthe law; beneath, on the right, the 'terrestrial Jerusalem,' wherein are\r\ndevout persons being devoured by serpents, with the serpent of brass in\r\nthe midst, and above it the words, 'Similitvde de la ivstification.' Moses\r\nappears on the right; at the left, and a little lower, Hagar and Ishmael;\r\nlower still, the prophet pointing out to Man Jesus on the Cross at the\r\nright.\r\n\r\nIn the compartment at the right we see God standing on the terrestrial\r\nglobe, with the words, 'Iervsalem celeste'; above, 'Mont Sion,' on which\r\nstands a woman's figure, with the words 'La Grace' over her head. An angel\r\nbearing a cross descends from Heaven (where are the words, 'Emmanvel Diev\r\navec novs') amid rays of light which fall upon the woman. Lower, at the\r\nleft, is another angel announcing the birth of Christ to the shepherds.\r\nNear by, at the right, the Christ on the Cross, with the words, 'nostre\r\nivstice,' and the Paschal Lamb, with the words, 'nostre innocence'; below,\r\nJesus coming forth from the tomb, with the words, 'nostre victoire'; still\r\nlower, at the left, St. John Baptist pointing out to Man the Christ on the\r\nCross; the Forerunner is indicated by the words, 'Lenseignevr de Christ,'\r\nin a cartouche; above St. John are Sarah and Isaac.\r\n\r\nIn each of the compartments is a number of figures which apparently\r\ncorrespond to some vanished text.[424] There are eight in the one at the\r\nright and nine in the other. 'Man' is marked with a zero. I am unable to\r\ngive the origin of this plate, which is in the Cabinet des Estampes in the\r\nBibliothèque Nationale, and was for a long time attributed to Jean Cousin.\r\nIt was M. Devéria who removed it from that artist's work and placed it\r\nwith Tory's, whose double cross it bears, at the left, below the cartouche\r\ncontaining the words 'Lenseignevr de Christ.' I believe that it belongs in\r\nsome large folio Bible; for I have seen the subject treated in a more or\r\nless summary fashion[425] on the title-pages of several Bibles, in French\r\nand other languages. I will mention particularly the following, all of\r\nwhich are in the Bibliothèque Nationale. (1) A French Bible, printed at\r\nAntwerp in 1530, by Martin l'Empereur; (2) A Bible in old Saxon, printed\r\nat Lubeck in 1533 by Ludowich Dietz (the same woodcuts reappear in an\r\nedition in Danish, issued by the same printer, at Copenhagen, in 1550);\r\n(3) A Bible in Latin, from the text of Erasmus, published in 1543 or 1544,\r\nwith two engravings by Cranach; (4) A Bible in Flemish, printed at Antwerp\r\nin 1556. I will mention also Luther's Latin Commentaries ('enarrationes')\r\non the Bible, printed at Nuremberg in 1555, with an engraving on the\r\ntitle-page dated 1552.\r\n\r\nWhatever its source, this drawing was reproduced in 1562, on a large\r\nenamelled plate in tinted grisaille, attributed to Pierre Rexmond,\r\nenameller, at Limoges. The sketch for this plate was published in 1843,\r\nafter a copy in the collection of M. Baron, in the volume entitled\r\n'Meubles et Armes du moyen âge,' a large quarto, published by Hauser,\r\ndealer in prints on Boulevard des Italiens.[426] It is no. 127 in the\r\ncollection. In this drawing the groups are arranged in chronological\r\norder, the circular form of the plate making it impossible to retain\r\nthe arrangement of the engraving. But the various subjects and their\r\nrespective inscriptions are identical, save for the errors in orthography\r\nwith which the Limousin artist has besprinkled the latter. The two\r\nJerusalems are separated by two trees, which, starting at the outer border\r\nof the plate, formed of Renaissance arabesques, join their heads at the\r\ncentre, where there is a medallion containing the face of Marguerite de\r\nValois, sister of François I.[427]\r\n\r\nThis subject has been treated also in a cameo now in the Bibliothèque\r\nNationale, but in a very summary fashion because of the small size of the\r\npiece, which is only 57 millimetres in width by 72 in height. All the\r\nessential details of the engraving are reproduced. A description of this\r\ninteresting cameo will be found under no. 317, in the 'Notice du Cabinet\r\ndes médailles,' published by M. Chabouillet, one of the conservators of\r\nthat priceless collection. It has been reproduced, too, in the collection\r\nof 'Mémoires de la Société des antiquaires de Morinie,' and the curious\r\nfeature of the business is that the engraver has taken for his mark the\r\narms of the city of Saint-Omer, which are the Lorraine cross.\r\n\r\n    II. RECUEIL DES ROIS DE FRANCE, LEURS COURONNE ET\r\n    MAISON, ENSEMBLE LES RENGS DES GRANDS DE FRANCE, par Jean du\r\n    Tillet, sieur de la Bussiere, protonotaire et secretaire du roy,\r\n    greffier de son parlement.--Plus, une chronique abrégée contenant\r\n    tout ce qui est advenu ... entre les roys et princes ... estrangers,\r\n    par M. Jean du Tillet, évêque de Maux.[428]\r\n\r\nFolio; one volume in two parts, Paris, J. du Puys, 1580.\r\n\r\nThis volume is an exact reproduction of the manuscript preserved at the\r\nBibliothèque Nationale, which I have already described.[429] Although\r\ndedicated to Charles IX, the book was prepared for publication at a much\r\nearlier date. In fact, the author tells us, in the dedicatory epistle,\r\nthat he had presented a copy to Henri II; indeed, it seems that he had it\r\nprepared for printing at the insistence of the King and Queen, who had\r\npromised 'to take care of the expenses.' This fact explains why almost\r\nall the portraits of the kings of France, from Clovis to François I,\r\nare signed with the Lorraine cross. These portraits are copied from the\r\nminiatures of the manuscript, but are on a smaller scale; furthermore they\r\nare in oval instead of square borders.\r\n\r\nDu Tillet died in 1570, before he was able to carry out his project of\r\nprinting this work. On August 10, 1578,[430] his heirs obtained a license\r\nto publish their 'late father's' work, which finally appeared in 1580; in\r\nfact, one part is dated 1579. They made use of the woodcuts bearing the\r\nLorraine cross. Jean du Puys, the publisher,[431] added to the book some\r\nportraits which are not in the manuscript (among others those of Henri II\r\nand Charles IX), and which consequently do not bear Tory's mark.\r\n\r\nFollowing is a complete list of the portraits contained in this volume,\r\nwith indication of those not in the manuscript and of those signed with\r\nthe Lorraine cross.\r\n\r\n    Folio  16, Clovis (signed).\r\n           18, Childebert; added.\r\n           19, Clotaire I (signed).\r\n           23, Sigebert (signed).\r\n           24, Chilperic and Fredegonde (signed).\r\n           28, Dagobert; added.\r\n           30, Clovis, son of Dagobert; added.\r\n           31, Clotaire III.\r\n           32, Childeric II; added.\r\n           35, Dagobert II; added.\r\n           41, Carloman I; added.\r\n           42, Charlemagne.\r\n           44, Louis le Debonnaire; modified.\r\n           48, Charles le Chauve (signed).\r\n           53, Charles le Simple.\r\n           54, Raoul (signed).\r\n           56, Louis d'Outre Mer.\r\n           58, Lothaire (signed).\r\n           75, Philippe I.\r\n           76, Louis le Gros.\r\n           92, Louis le Jeune.\r\n           94, Philippe-Auguste (signed).\r\n          101, Louis, père de Saint Louis (signed).\r\n          109, Charles II; added.\r\n          112, Saint Louis.\r\n          121, Philippe III; added.\r\n          133, Philippe le Bel (signed).\r\n          134, Louis le Hutin.\r\n          136, Philippe le Long.\r\n          137, Charles le Bel (signed).\r\n          138, Philippe de Valois.\r\n          140, Jean.\r\n          157, Charles V.\r\n          160, Charles VI.\r\n          164, Louis XI.\r\n          165, Charles VIII (signed).\r\n          166, Louis XII (signed); modified.\r\n          167, François I (signed); modified.\r\n          168, Henri II and Catherine de Médicis; added.\r\n          169, François II; added.\r\n          169, Charles IX; added.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that there are, in all, 10[432] portraits added to those\r\nfound in the manuscript. For the other princes mentioned in the work,\r\nwhose features it was impossible to present, empty frames are printed.\r\nNaturally, none of the portraits added to du Tillet's book by the editor\r\nare marked with the Lorraine cross, and of the other 31, there are only\r\n15[433] on which it is found.\r\n\r\nThese cuts were reproduced in a great many later editions of du Tillet's\r\nwork, both folio and quarto. I will mention particularly those of 1586,\r\n1587, 1602, 1607, and 1608.\r\n\r\nThe volume contains also many engravings of shields and seals.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    III.

It was undoubtedly engraved long before 1598.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    V. ILLUSTRATION DE L'ANCIENNE IMPRIMERIE TROYENNE.\r\n\r\nQuarto, Troyes, 1850 and 1859. The first fascicle of this book, which\r\nconsists of a collection of old woodcuts gathered by M. Varlot in the\r\nprinting-offices of Troyes, contains two signed with the Lorraine cross.\r\nThey are nos. 50 and 188. The first represents the Coronation of the\r\nVirgin; we may join with it a piece in the same manner representing the\r\nVisitation, no. 51 in the same collection; and no. 5 (the Virgin holding\r\nthe Child Jesus) of the fascicle published in 1859. These cuts, which are\r\nin format a small folio, doubtless formed part of a series of engravings\r\nrelating to the Virgin and intended for a book of Hours.\r\n\r\nMM. Alexis Socard and Alexandre Assier, in their work entitled 'Livres\r\nliturgiques du diocèse de Troyes' (8vo, 1863), also give, on page 79,\r\nan old Troyes woodcut, small folio, signed with the double cross,\r\nrepresenting the Descent of the Holy Ghost on the Virgin and the Apostles.\r\nIt is 135 millimetres high by 60 in width.\r\n\r\nNo. 188 of M. Varlot's fascicle, which is only one inch high by two wide,\r\nrepresents a harvest. It was undoubtedly one of a series of engravings\r\nillustrative of the twelve months. MM. Socard and Assier saw it in a book\r\nof Hours printed at Troyes in 1583, by Jean du Ruan, who seems to have\r\ninherited a portion of the woodcuts of Jean Le Coq, printer, of the same\r\ncity. We find also in M. Varlot's collection two woodcuts marked with the\r\nletters G. T., which may have been Geofroy Tory's earlier mark, before he\r\nhad adopted a special symbol. These two are no. 84, in the criblé style,\r\nand no. 131, in the Renaissance style.[434]\r\n\r\nOn account of the worn state of these cuts it is impossible to say whether\r\nthey are originals or copies. It is not impossible, however, that they\r\nwere executed by Tory for the printer Nicole Paris, or rather for Jean Le\r\nCoq, whose mark he engraved also.[435]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVI. Not only at Paris and Troyes do we find woodcuts with the\r\nLorraine cross; we find them also at Orléans, at Chartres, at Poitiers,\r\nand even at Lyon, although the last-named city had a most flourishing\r\nschool of engraving of its own; witness the illustrations of the Bible\r\nafter Holbein,[436] published by Jean Frellon, in 1547, and those of\r\nSalomon Bernard, published by the de Tournes after 1553. But the works\r\nexecuted by Tory for Simon de Colines, Robert Estienne, and the rest, had\r\nso spread his name abroad, that there was not a printer of taste in France\r\nwho did not seek the honour of obtaining some work of our artist. In this\r\nway Jean de Tournes, first of the name, who was unquestionably one of\r\nthe most famous printers of Lyon, had engraved by Tory, or by his widow,\r\nborders and pictures in considerable numbers; unfortunately we find very\r\nfew of them signed, whether because Tory's mark was afterward removed from\r\nthe others, or because he omitted to place it upon them, in accordance\r\nwith the wish of Jean de Tournes; for in those days printers were very\r\ndesirous to appropriate the engravings that they ordered, especially at\r\nLyon, where, nominally at least, no other engraver was known than Salomon\r\nBernard; moreover, it is well to note that that artist, none of whose work\r\nis signed, is known only because his name was afterward published by the\r\nprinters, in the very interest of their publications.\r\n\r\nHowever, I propose to give a list of the pieces signed with the Lorraine\r\ncross which I have seen in books published by the de Tournes, that is, by\r\nJean I and Jean II, his son; for it is impossible, in default of any sort\r\nof a catalogue, for me to decide what ones are attributable to each of\r\nthem. As a matter of fact, I should be justified in confining myself to\r\nthe second, if he had not himself said that he used woodcuts belonging to\r\nhis father. And, in truth, although we know of no books published by the\r\nlatter with engravings, except his edition of Petrarch of 1545 (reprinted\r\nin 1547), and his book of Chiromancy and Physiognomy, also of 1545,\r\noctavo, everything seems to indicate that those marked with the Lorraine\r\ncross were made for Jean I, who died about 1550.\r\n\r\nThe first book that I shall mention is an octavo volume, without title,\r\ndescribed thus by M. Didot in his 'Essai sur la Gravure,' col. 235;\r\n'Pamphlet without title, printed on one side only, with this imprint on\r\npage 1: \"A Lion, Ian de Tournes, 1551.\" The border, composed of arabesques\r\nin white on a black ground, has at the foot the Lorraine cross. Twenty-two\r\nof these engravings represent scenes from the theatre of the ancients; the\r\nninth bears the Lorraine cross.' This pamphlet was reprinted in 1556, as\r\nwe shall see in a moment.\r\n\r\nThe second book that I shall mention is an octavo volume, without date,\r\nentitled: 'Thesaurus amicorum,' which is in the Bibliothèque Nationale. It\r\ncontains three series of borders: (1) Borders with arabesques in black on\r\na white ground (one of them is signed with a very small Lorraine cross);\r\n(2) Borders with arabesques in white on a black ground (one of these also\r\nis signed with a small white cross); (3) Borders with grotesque subjects,\r\nlicentious and otherwise. These last, none of which are signed, represent\r\nfigures analogous to those that are found in the 'Songes drolatiques'\r\nattributed to Rabelais, and seem to be modelled upon them.\r\n\r\nIn the first part of the book, the borders, 32 in number, are empty[437];\r\nin the second part, they enclose medallions of famous characters of\r\nancient times, with mottoes in all sorts of languages. There are\r\n96 of these portraits. They were reproduced, with many others, in a\r\nbook printed in 1559, under the title, 'Insignium aliquot virorum\r\nicones' (octavo).[438] In the dedication, to G. Tuffano, 'gymnasiarchæ\r\nNemausensi,' Jean de Tournes, second of the name, the printer of the\r\nbook, informs us that he undertook it in order to utilize the woodcuts\r\nleft by his father. 'Cum pater jamdudum haberet hasce icones inutiles ne\r\nomnino perirent, hæc pauca, quæ huic opusculo insunt, ex variis auctoribus\r\naccumulavi....' In this book the medallions number one hundred and\r\nforty-three; none are signed, but they are altogether in Tory's manner.\r\n\r\nThese same medallions, as well as the borders of the 'Thesaurus amicorum,'\r\nhave been used in a multitude of other publications, which are known to us\r\nonly through detached fragments. I will mention particularly eight leaves\r\npreserved in the Cabinet des Estampes, printed on one side only, having\r\na border with a portrait on each page.[439] Also, four leaves without\r\nborders, on each of which two portraits are printed, side by side.[440]\r\n\r\nAs for the borders, they appear again,--first, in the edition of Marot's\r\nPsalms, published by Jean de Tournes in 1557, in octavo; and second, with\r\nless impropriety, in the various editions, both in French and in Italian,\r\nof Ovid's 'Metamorphoses,' issued by the same printer.\r\n\r\nJean de Tournes published also, in 1556, a small octavo volume of\r\nspecimens of his woodcuts, printed on one side only. This volume, which\r\nis well known to collectors, and which may be found in the Cabinet\r\ndes Estampes, has on the first page these words alone: 'A Lion, Ian\r\nde Tournes, M.D.LVI.'[441] This page has a border of white\r\narabesques on a black ground, in which the Lorraine cross is perfectly\r\nvisible, at the foot. There are 22 engravings representing scenes from the\r\ntheatre of the ancients.\r\n\r\nThe ninth bears the Lorraine cross. In the midst of this series, on leaf\r\n21, is a piece which does not belong to the series; it represents a dog\r\nlying on a cushion.[442] After this series come various engravings which\r\nwe find in Maurice de Seve's 'Saulsaye' (octavo, Lyon, 1547), in Ovid's\r\n'Metamorphoses,' and the 'Hymnes du Temps' of Guillaume Gueroult, which\r\nwere printed subsequently; then 11 plates bearing two figures facing\r\neach other, taken from a work on Chiromancy and Physiognomy, by Indagine\r\n(octavo, Lyon, 1549); 5 engravings from the edition of Petrarch issued\r\nby the first Jean in 1545; and 9 small miscellaneous subjects.[443] The\r\nCabinet des Estampes also contains one leaf of a folio specimen of the\r\nwoodcuts of the de Tournes, in which we find again the plates of the\r\nPetrarch. It lacks, however, the Lac d'Amour, which is on folio 5 of the\r\ncollection we are describing, and is altogether in the manner of the seven\r\nepitaphs published by Tory in 1530.[444]\r\n\r\nI will not enumerate here the other books with engravings, of later date,\r\npublished by the second Jean de Tournes, because there is nothing to\r\njustify me in attributing them to Tory's workshop; but one may conclude\r\nfrom what I have said heretofore, that many engravings of the printers of\r\nLyon, hitherto attributed to Salomon Bernard, called Le Petit Bernard,\r\ncame from Tory's establishment. Indeed, we may well wish that Le Petit\r\nBernard might be relieved of the enormous mass of engravings which have\r\nbeen attributed to him for lack of information concerning them, but which\r\nrender uncertain the attribution of those which most certainly belong to\r\nhim.[445]\r\n\r\nOur list includes only engravings on wood; but I have no doubt that Tory\r\nengraved also on metal, and not alone letters, which we should naturally\r\nexpect from Garamond's master, but plates as well. Now that the eyes of\r\ncollectors are about to be opened, I should not be surprised if some one\r\nshould discover one marked with his cross.[446] To forward such discovery\r\nI will insert the estimate of Tory's draughtsmanship formed by M.\r\nRenouvier, who is so competent a judge of such matters.\r\n\r\n'The plates of \"Champ fleury,\" the first of which is dated 1526, have\r\nan Italian after-taste, which manifests itself by the correctness of\r\nthe figures, and by their costumes; but the delicacy of expression, the\r\nfineness of line, distinguish them clearly from the Venetian vignettes.\r\nThe vignettes of the Hours published between 1524 and 1543, varying in\r\nexecution, always delicate and with little shading, exhibit a degree of\r\ntaste which the Parmesan School sometimes achieves; but by the delicacy\r\nof their execution they deserve the praise bestowed upon them by Dibdin.\r\nEven if the figures are slightly confused in their attitudes and in their\r\ndraperies, or defective at some of the extremities, still, the spirited\r\ndrawing of the heads, and the arrangement of the scenes, amid charming\r\narchitectural designs, or in very restricted fields, show that our\r\nengravers of vignettes lost nothing of their talent in passing from gothic\r\nto italic letters, and, despite the name of the latter, it is certain that\r\nItaly never produced any like them. Simplicity took the place of Gothic\r\n_goguenarderie_; their expression is in the most refined French sentiment\r\nof the period.[447]\r\n\r\n'I seem to recognize Geofroy Tory's style in the \"Tableau de Cèbes,\"\r\npublished by Denis Janot and Gilles Corrozet in 1543, the vignettes\r\nof which are often attributed to Jean Cousin. As for Tory's drawing, I\r\nshould recognize it through several layers of wood, by the delicately\r\ndrawn heads, the slender figures, the split extremities, to say nothing\r\nof the floriated letters and the borders, in which the Italian grotesques\r\nare mingled with natural vegetations, and in which he has often engraved\r\nhis name, his Pot Cassé and his mottoes. In Tory's vignettes there are\r\ndoubtless qualities that are more subtle than great, but they are our\r\nqualities.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 319: See Part 1, Biography, supra, p. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 320: This plate was reproduced by MM.

But there is no question at all concerning the following pieces,\r\nwhich certainly belong to Salomon Bernard:--\r\n\r\nI. The figures of the Bible, to the number of 251, reprinted\r\nvery frequently after 1553. In an edition of 1680, printed by Samuel de\r\nTournes, at Geneva, whither the second Jean withdrew about 1580, because\r\nof his religion, is the following note: 'The figures that we offer you\r\nhere are from the hand of an excellent craftsman, known in his day under\r\nthe name of Salomon Bernard, called Le Petit Bernard, and have always been\r\nheld in esteem by those who are learned in works of this sort.'\r\n\r\nII. Claude Paradin's _Devises héroiques_, containing 184\r\nengravings, besides a border on the title-page. Large octavo, Jean de\r\nTournes, 1557 ( Bibliothèque Nationale). The license at the end of the\r\nvolume discloses the titles of several other volumes which Jean de Tournes\r\nwas then intending to publish, particularly the two following, which\r\nappeared the same year.\r\n\r\nIII. The Metamorphoses of Ovid; octavo, 1557; 178 engravings.\r\n\r\nIV. _L'Astronomique Discours_, by Jacques Bassentin; folio, 1557;\r\nwith a large number of astronomical plates.\r\n\r\nV. _Hymnes du temps_, by Guillaume Gueroult; quarto, 1560; 88\r\npages, with borders and drawings. In the _avis au lecteur_ we read: 'I\r\nhope that you will find some pleasure herein, for that the whole is\r\nthe work of a goodly hand; for the invention [of the engravings] is of\r\nM. Bernard Salomon, an excellent painter as there has ever been in our\r\nhemisphere.'\r\n\r\nVI. Virgil's Æneid, French translation; quarto, 1560; with 12\r\nvignettes.\r\n\r\nVII. A book of _Thermes_, in eighteen orders; printed at Lyon in\r\n1572, by Jean Marcorelle.--At the tenth _therme_ is a genie carving on a\r\nshield the letter S, the initial of Bernard's baptismal name.\r\n\r\nA large number of vignettes, and of letters in grisaille, used by the\r\nprinters of Lyon, are also attributed to this artist.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 446: See what I have had to say on this subject apropos of\r\nBaïf's _Annotations_, supra, p. 208.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 447: _Des Types et des Manières des maîtres graveurs_, etc.,\r\n16th century, pp. 167, 168.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III. MARKS OF BOOKSELLERS AND PRINTERS SIGNED WITH THE LORRAINE\r\nCROSS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRINCIPIVM EX FIDE, FINIS IN CHARITATE.]\r\n\r\nThe inventor of the Pot Cassé was chosen by his confrères, in preference\r\nto all other engravers, to engrave their private marks. They had realized\r\nthe force of his 'kindly exhortation to practice and employ themselves in\r\ngoodly inventions,'[448] and had been impressed by the perfection with\r\nwhich he executed that species of engraving, which he had completely\r\ntransformed. For, in lieu of the coarse vignettes with a black background,\r\non which the design stood out in white, as if cut with a die, Tory had\r\ngradually introduced into these woodcuts all the delicacy of the Italian\r\nengravings. The earliest ones of his of which we have any knowledge are\r\nin the criblé style, which the Middle Ages had handed down to him; but he\r\nsoon rejected that style and not only adopted a new manner of engraving,\r\nbut altered the arrangement of the designs that were entrusted to him.\r\nThis fact is especially manifest if we compare the original mark of the de\r\nMarnefs (Silvestre, 'Marques Typographiques' no. 151) with the one that\r\nbears the motto, 'Principivm ex fide, finis in charitate' (Silvestre, no.\r\n1043). Instead of the roughly drawn Pelican nourishing from its vitals\r\nits still more roughly drawn young, in a nest perched on a tree of which\r\nthe leaves are larger than the trunk, we have, in the second engraving\r\n[given above], an entirely new composition, of which both design and\r\nexecution are irreproachable. In the face of such results, we should not\r\nbe surprised by the predilection of the printer-booksellers for Tory; they\r\ndeemed it a duty to employ a confrère who poetized their profession: to\r\nthem it was a question of esprit de corps and of patriotism alike.\r\n\r\nThat is why we have so many typographical marks signed with the Lorraine\r\ncross. We propose to enumerate all of those which we have actually had\r\nbefore us. As it was impossible to arrange them chronologically, we have\r\nadopted the alphabetical order.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nALARD (GUILLAUME), bookseller at Paris in 1550.

Conrad's mark, like that of his father, Josse Bade, represents\r\na printing-press. It contains also the words 'Prelum ascensianum';\r\nbut, instead of being inscribed in a cartouche on the press, they are\r\nin two cartouches, one at the top, the other at the bottom, of the\r\nborder (Silvestre, no. 867). When Conrad betook himself to Geneva, Eloi\r\nGibier,[449] a printer of Orléans, bought the mark. It afterwards passed\r\nto Fabian Hotot, a printer in the same city, who was using it in 1609; but\r\nbefore using it he had the word 'Ascensianum' removed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBESSAULT (THIBAUT, and JEAN, his son),\r\nbooksellers at Paris.

I have seen one of these marks, the larger, in an\r\nedition of Rodolphe Agricola's book entitled: 'De Inventione dialectica\r\nlibri tres' (quarto, 1558), on the title-page of which is this imprint:\r\n'Parisiis, ex officina Simonis Calvarini, in vico Belovaco, ad Virtutis\r\ninsigne.'[450] The smaller one appears at the end of a book entitled:\r\n'Conservation de santé et prolongation de vie, etc., composé premierement\r\npar noble homme H. [Hieronime] Monteux, conseiller et medecin ordinaire\r\ndu roi François II, et nouvellement traduit en nostre langue fraçoise\r\npar maistre Claude de Valgelas, docteur medecin, etc. Paris, chez Simon\r\nCalvarin, rue Saint-Jacques, à la Rose blanche couronnée, 1572.' This\r\nis a 16mo, of which there is a copy in the Bibliothèque Nationale. This\r\nSimon was, I have no doubt, a son of Prigent Calvarin, printer at Paris\r\nfrom 1524 to 1582, whose mark is very different (Silvestre, no. 137).[451]\r\nIt represents two persons holding a shield which hangs from a vine, with\r\nthese sentences surrounding them: 'Deum time,' 'Pauperes sustine,' 'Finem\r\nrespice,' 'Prigent Calvarin.' Simon, having set up for himself during his\r\nfather's lifetime, had to adopt a different mark.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCHAUDIÈRE (REGNAULT), bookseller at Paris from 1516 to 1546, in\r\nthe latter year succeeded to the printing business of Simon de Colines,\r\nwhose marks 'au Temps' he used thereafter. He had a new one engraved in\r\nTory's establishment, with the same figure, but with a slightly different\r\nmotto: it reads: 'Virtus sola aciem retundit istam.' This mark appears in\r\nthe edition of the comedies of Terence printed in 1546. See COLINES\r\n(SIMON DE).\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOLINES (SIMON DE), printer-bookseller at Paris from 1520 to\r\n1546. Four marks at least. See the two already described in the preceding\r\nsection, under 1520-1521, as forming a part of title-pages, and numbers\r\n80 and 329 of M. Silvestre's 'Marques typographiques.' The last two\r\npassed in 1546 into the hands of Regnault Chaudière, a bookseller since\r\n1516. Chaudière had married Colines's daughter by the widow of Henri\r\nEstienne, and by virtue of the connection inherited his father-in-law's\r\nprinting-office and bookshop. He himself printed, in 1546-1547, under the\r\nLatin name Calderius, an edition of the comedies of Terence[452]; at the\r\nend is M. Silvestre's no. 329, which (like no. 80) represents Time armed\r\nwith a scythe, and this devise in a scroll: 'Hanc aciem sola retundit\r\nvirtus.' Chaudière, who had previously used another mark (Silvestre, no.\r\n96), employed thenceforth this one with the figure of Time, and handed it\r\ndown to his successors.[453] In 1548 he published an octavo catalogue of\r\nhis own books and those of Simon de Colines--'tum ab Simone Colinæi, tum\r\nab Calderio excusi.'[454] The following is, in my opinion, the order in\r\nwhich Simon de Colines's various marks were engraved by Tory: In the first\r\nplace, in 1520, the one with the rabbits, or _conils_, which it has been\r\nsaid that Colines adopted as a play upon his own name; but this conjecture\r\nseems to me the more improbable because these same rabbits had been used\r\non the sign of Henri Estienne's shop as early as 1502.[455] However that\r\nmay be, Colines seems to have retained this mark during all the time\r\nthat he occupied Henri Estienne's house. When he turned over that abode,\r\nin 1525, to Robert Estienne, who established himself in business on the\r\npaternal premises, Colines went a little farther down rue de Beauvais, and\r\ntook for his sign the 'Soleil d'or,' which appears on the second mark;\r\nfinally, in 1528, he adopted the one with the figure of Time, which was\r\nafterwards adopted by his son-in-law, Regnault Chaudière.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: S. DE COLLINES]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GILLES CORROZET]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCORROZET (GILLES), bookseller at Paris from 1538 to 1568.--One\r\nmark, representing, by way of allusion to the name of its owner, a rose\r\nupon a heart ('cor'), and with 'Gilles Corrozet' at the foot (Silvestre,\r\nno. 145). This mark, which I have seen on a book of 1539,[456] was\r\nundoubtedly the first that Corrozet used. It descended to his heirs, and\r\nhis grandson Jean was still using it a century later, on the 'Trésor des\r\nhistoires de France,' the work of another Gilles Corrozet, which Jean\r\nreprinted several times between 1622 and 1644. Jean simply removed from\r\nthe mark his grandfather's Christian name, regardless of the lack of\r\nsymmetry in the engraving caused by this subtraction. So that here was an\r\nengraving that was in use more than a hundred years; it is an interesting\r\nexample of the durability of these woodcuts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOTEREAU or COTTEREAU (RICHARD), bookseller at\r\nChartres;--(PHILIPPE), bookseller at Blois.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDAVID (MATHIEU), printer-bookseller at Paris from 1554 to 1566.\r\nThree marks (Silvestre, nos. 227, 394, and 759). They represent a warrior\r\nbearing on his shoulders a woman plunging a sword in his throat. One of\r\nthe marks has the word 'odiosa' in the border on one side, and 'veritas'\r\non the other. Another is printed in an octavo volume of 1539 (Bibliothèque\r\nNationale), Ravisius Textor's 'Epistolæ a mendis repurgata.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NOLI ALTVM SAPERE]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDUPUY (J.), printer at Paris in 1549.

Six marks at least, representing the olive-tree in different\r\nforms. Three of them are reproduced in M. Silvestre's work: nos. 162,\r\n318,[457] and 319[458]; add to these the large folio mark that appears\r\non the Bible of 1528[459] and that of 1540, previously described; a\r\nsmall mark which appears in the 16mo Virgil of 1549; and, lastly, a mark\r\nsimilar to Silvestre's no. 163 (except that the figure is bald), which\r\nappears in 'Caroli Stephani de Nutrimentis,' etc.[460] Probably most\r\nof these marks were engraved for Robert Estienne at the outset of his\r\ntypographical career, that is to say, about 1526; he carried them with him\r\nto Geneva in 1550; and his son, the second Henri, used them in his turn,\r\nafter his father's death, which occurred in 1559. It was undoubtedly the\r\nwidow of Tory who engraved the mark (in different sizes) which appears,\r\nafter 1544, on the Greek books printed with the royal types, and which\r\nrepresents a basilisk entwined about a lance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nESTIENNE (CHARLES), printer and bookseller at Paris from 1551 to\r\n1561. Three marks at least. Upon entering the typographical profession\r\nCharles adopted his brother's olive-tree; that is to say, he simply had\r\ncopies made of Robert's marks, as he succeeded to his business. I have\r\nseen the first of these marks, similar to Silvestre's no. 163, in an\r\noctavo edition of P. Bunel's 'Epîtres familières,' printed by Charles in\r\n1551; the second appears in a folio edition of Cicero, in four volumes,\r\npublished by the same printer from 1551 to 1555[461]; and the third, like\r\nSilvestre's no. 162, in the 'Petit Dictionnaire français-latin' (quarto),\r\npublished by Charles in 1559. It is probable that the second Robert used\r\nthese same marks after his uncle's retirement in 1561.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFEZANDAT (MICHEL), printer-bookseller at Paris from 1541 to 1553.\r\nOne mark (Silvestre, no. 423). This mark which, by way of allusion to the\r\nname of its owner, represents a pheasant (_faisan_) on a dolphin, with\r\nthe letters M and F at the left and right, respectively, of the pheasant,\r\nwas used without the initials in 1549, as may be seen on the title of 'Le\r\nTemple du chasteté,' printed in that year by Fezandat, in octavo.[462]\r\n\r\nIn 1550, one Guillaume Alard (Fezandat's son-in-law, it may be), who\r\nlived 'e regione collegii de la Mercy,' also used the mark in that\r\nform.[463] The appearance of this mark on Alard's book may be due solely\r\nto the fact that the book in question was printed by Fezandat. I have been\r\nunable to ascertain the facts because the fragment of the title-page on\r\nwhich I saw the mark and Alard's name does not contain the title of the\r\nbook. The only possible clue is the three Greek verses on the other side\r\nof the page, which lead one to think that it may have been a work of Jean\r\nBlaccus Danois, of whom we have a translation of Isocrates into Latin\r\nverses, printed by Regnault Chaudière, also in 1550 (quarto).[464] This G.\r\nAlard is not named by Lottin in his 'Catalogue des imprimeurs-libraires\r\nde Paris.' I find the same mark in a small volume entitled 'Le Bouquet\r\ndes fleurs de Sénèque'; octavo; Caen, 'de l'imprimerie de Jacques le\r\nBas, imprimeur du roy,' 1590.[465] I find Fezandat's mark also in a book\r\npublished by the bookseller J. Dupuy in 1549: 'Novum Testamentum,' in\r\nGreek and Latin; 16mo. Why? I have no idea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGIBIER (ELOI), printer at Orléans. One mark, representing a\r\nprinting-press. This printer, whose oldest known imprint is dated 1559,\r\nhad evidently practised his trade several years earlier. This is what\r\nwe find concerning him in the 'Bibliothèque historique des auteurs\r\norléanais,' by Dom Gerou, which is preserved in manuscript in the Public\r\nLibrary of Orléans: 'We may say that Eloy Gibier was in a certain sense\r\nthe first printer of Orléans; Mathieu Vivian and Pierre Asselin had\r\npreceded him, but we know of only a single work printed by each of them,\r\nwhereas there are a great number by Eloy Gibier. We do not know when he\r\nbegan, but the earliest book printed by him of which we have any knowledge\r\nis of 1559. At first he put no symbol on the title-pages of his works;\r\nthe place where the symbol should be was entirely unoccupied; later, he\r\nsometimes inserted one, but not always. This symbol was a printing-press,\r\nabout which were the words: \"In sudore vultus tui vesceris pane tuo.\"'\r\nI have seen this mark on the 'Coutumes générales d'Orléans,' printed by\r\nGibier in 1570, octavo.[466] But he afterward adopted the mark of Conrad\r\nBade. See that name.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGOURMONT (GILLES DE), printer-bookseller at Paris, from 1506 to\r\n1530.--Three marks. The first, in the form of a border, is found on the\r\ntitle-page of a volume containing nine comedies of Aristophanes, printed\r\nby Pierre Vidoue, at Gilles de Gourmont's expense, in 1528 (quarto)[467]:\r\na description of it will be found above.[468] The second represents Fame:\r\nit is a nude woman, winged, all over whose body are eyes, tongues, and\r\nears. At the foot, in a scroll, are the words: 'Ecqvis incvmbere famae'\r\n('poterit' understood, no doubt). The Lorraine cross appears at the left\r\non the lower edge of the engraving. I have seen this mark on a small book\r\nentitled: 'Alphabetum hebraicum,' consisting of 8 leaves, printed by\r\nPierre Vidoue (Silvestre, no. 98). Although the name of Gourmont nowhere\r\nappears in this case, I have no doubt that the mark belongs to Gilles\r\nde Gourmont, for it is accompanied by his initials, E and G (Egidius\r\nGourmontius), at the left and right respectively; and we shall see that\r\nthis same mark was afterward used by Jérôme de Gourmont, Gilles's son or\r\nnephew. It maybe that it was because of the loan of Gourmont's Hebrew\r\ntype that his mark appears on this precious pamphlet, a description of\r\nwhich follows. First leaf, beginning at the end (according to the Hebrew\r\nand Arabic custom), Gourmont's mark in a border of detached compartments.\r\nOn the verso Pierre Vidoue's epistle to the reader, dated from his\r\nworkshop August 1, 1531. Then comes the text, followed by this subscript:\r\n'Petrus Vidovæus Vernoliensis excudebat Lutetiæ' And, lastly, Vidoue's\r\nmark--Fortune, with the words: 'Audentes juvo' (Silvestre, no. 65). The\r\nthird of Gilles de Gourmont's marks signed with the Lorraine cross is\r\ngiven by M. Silvestre (no. 826). [This mark forms the lower part of the\r\nborder first described, and has evidently been cut from the border for use\r\nseparately.] It represents the Gourmont arms[469]: a shield coupé, three\r\nroses in chief and a crescent in base; for crest a St. Michael, holding\r\na bare sword, supports two winged stags with ducal coronets about their\r\nnecks. This subject, much more fully developed, appears on the first page\r\nof the 'Tableaux des Arts Libéraux de Savigny,' in-plano,[470] published\r\nin 1587, by Jean and François, sons of Gilles de Gourmont, who succeeded\r\nto his establishment on rue Saint-Jean-de-Latran.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGOURMONT (JÉRÔME DE), printer-bookseller at Paris from 1524 to\r\n1533.--One mark representing Fame, copied from the second mark of Gilles\r\nde Gourmont just described, but reversed. Beneath the inscription 'Ecqvis\r\nincvmbere famae,' in a small cartouche, are the initials H. D. G. (Hierome\r\nde Gourmont), with the Lorraine cross just above. I have seen this mark in\r\nan octavo volume published at Paris in 1534 by Jérôme de Gourmont, under\r\nthis title: 'Pauli Paradisi ... de modo legendi hebraice dialogus,'[471]\r\nand in another octavo, also published at Paris ('Dionysiæ') in 1535, under\r\na Greek title of which the Latin translation is: 'Apollonius Alexandrinus,\r\nde Constructione.'[472] Jérôme de Gourmont published at least one other\r\nbook at 'Dionysiæ' in 1535; but I do not know the title, as I have not\r\nseen the title-page. All that I can say is that Ausonius is quoted in the\r\nLatin preface printed on the verso of the first leaf, of which I have seen\r\nonly a fragment, belonging to M. Silvestre.\r\n\r\nI believe that Jérôme de Gourmont did some printing, although he is\r\nnamed only as a bookseller in the bibliographies. The books that I have\r\nmentioned show that he was a scholar who followed in the tracks of Gilles\r\nde Gourmont. Indeed, the one first described, which is in Latin, contains\r\nsome Hebrew words; the second is entirely in Greek.\r\n\r\nI have seen a little book, printed at Paris in 1539, with Jérôme de\r\nGourmont's mark: it is 'Pugna porcorum per J. Porcium,' octavo. The\r\nsubscript below the mark reads: 'Parisiis, apud Anthonium Bonnemere.' Was\r\nAnthoine Bonnemere publisher for Jérôme de Gourmont, at the same sign?\r\nThat is something that I do not know.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGOURMONT (BENOÎT DE), bookseller at Paris.--One mark,\r\nrepresenting a man standing above two precipices; above him is a scroll\r\nwith the words: 'Vndiqve praecipitivm'; and at his feet the initials B. D.\r\nG. (Silvestre, no. 838).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGRANDIN (LOUIS), printer-bookseller at Paris, from 1542 to\r\n1553.--Two marks (Silvestre, nos. 277 and 416). They represent two men,\r\none of whom is receiving a sphere from the hand of God; the other holds\r\none which is crumbling in his fingers. On the second of the two marks are\r\nthe words: 'Confidere in Domino bonum esse quam confidere in homine. Ps.\r\n117.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGUEULLARD (JEAN), printer-bookseller at Paris, from 1552 to\r\n1553.--Two marks representing the Phœnix rising from the flames,[473] in\r\nan oval border. The smaller one has, within the border, the words, 'Amor\r\nvitæ acer nimis,' with Gueullard's initials, I. G., below (Silvestre, no.\r\n790). This mark is .055 of a millimetre high by .044 wide. I have seen it\r\nin a book entitled: 'Petri Ruffi Druydæ dialectica, nuper ab eodem autore\r\nemendatur,' quarto, 1553 (3d edition).[474] The larger one has this motto\r\nwithin the border: 'Mori vivere mihi est'; it is .087 of a millimetre high\r\nby .063 wide (Silvestre, no. 882). I have seen it in a book entitled,\r\n'Hexastichorum moralium libri duo, per Nic. Querculum Tortronensem Rhemum;\r\nquarto, Paris, 1552.'[475] See HARSY (OLIVIER DE).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGUILLARD (CHARLOTTE), printer-bookseller from 1518 to 1556.--One\r\nmark representing her sign, a golden sun in a starry sky. Below, two lions\r\nerect, holding a shield on which are the initials C. G. This lady carried\r\non the printing trade for more than fifty years. She married first, in\r\n1502, Berthold Rembold, a partner of the first printer in Paris, Ulric\r\nGering. Berthold, who had established his domicile on rue Saint-Jacques,\r\n'au Soleil d'Or,' having left Charlotte a widow in 1518, she carried on\r\nthe business alone until 1520, when she married Claude Chevallon, who took\r\nup his abode on the same premises. Chevallon having departed this life, in\r\nhis turn, in 1542, Charlotte continued in the business until 1556. It was\r\nduring her second widowhood that the mark in question, which we reproduce\r\nherewith, was engraved. I have seen it on a quarto volume entitled,\r\n'Institutionum civilium libri quatuor, 1550. Parisiis, apud Carolam\r\nGuillard, viduam Claudi Chevallonii, sub Soli aureo, et Guilelmum Desbois,\r\nsub Cruce Alba, in via divi Jacobi.' Claude Chevallon had upon his mark,\r\nby way of allusion to his name, two horses standing (cheval-long). But M.\r\nSilvestre publishes as his (no. 395) a mark which has the lions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHARSY (OLIVIER DE), bookseller at Paris, from 1556 to 1584,\r\nused Gueullard's mark on several works written by Nicolas Ellain;\r\namong others, 'Elegia libri duo ad Joach.

This mark appears in a 'Graduel'\r\nof 1521, previously described.[477] We find it again in a book of Hours\r\naccording to the use of Toul, published in 1541, which contains many\r\nother engravings signed with the double cross.[478] Also in a small book\r\npublished in our own day by Aubry the bookseller[479]; that is to say,\r\nthis particular woodcut is still in existence and belongs to M. Aubry.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLE NOIR (PHILIPPE), printer-bookseller at Paris, from 1520 to\r\n1539. Three marks,[480] representing two negroes (noirs) holding a shield\r\nwith Philippe le Noir's initials.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMALLARD (OLIVIER), printer-bookseller at Paris, from 1536 to 1542.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMALLARD (JEAN), bookseller at Rouen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMARNEF, DE: Enguilbert, Jean and Geoffroy, brothers, were\r\nprinters and booksellers at Paris and Poitiers, together or separately,\r\nfrom 1510 to 1550. Their mark was a pelican, piercing his side in order\r\nto nourish his young. Tory engraved for them at least two marks: one\r\nwhich appears on a book printed by Enguilbert and Jean, in Poitiers, in\r\n1536,[481] entitled 'Les angoisses et remedes d'amour du Traverseur en son\r\nadolescence' (by Jean Bouchet), with this device: 'Eximii amoris typus';\r\nit is reproduced by Dibdin,[482] and by Silvestre (no. 152).[483] The\r\nother may be seen in the Print Section of the Bibliothèque Nationale,\r\namong Tory's work; the pelican and its young are in an oval border, around\r\nwhich is this device: 'Principium ex fide, finis in charitate' (Silvestre,\r\nno. 1044). [See also the reproduction at the beginning of this section,\r\npage 265.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMENIER (MAURICE), printer at Paris, from 1545 to 1566.--One mark\r\n(Silvestre, no. 789), representing a man closing a woman's mouth, with\r\nthis device, 'Coercenda volvptas.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMERLIN (GUILLAUME), bookseller at Paris, from 1538 to 1570.--One\r\nmark, representing a swan whose neck is twined about a cross, surrounded\r\nby the device, 'In hoc signo vinces.' The Lorraine cross is barely visible\r\nin the lowest ornament of the engraving. I have seen this mark on the\r\nfirst page of a 'Missale ecclesie Parisiensis,' in folio, without date,\r\nprinted by Iolande Bonhomme, widow of the first Thielman Kerver, as is\r\nshown by the presence of that printer's mark on the first page of the\r\ntext; it may be that there are copies in her name. This book is without\r\ndate, but should be placed between the years 1532 and 1552, which embrace\r\nthe incumbency of Jean du Bellay as Archbishop of Paris. Merlin's mark is\r\n.095 of a millimetre high by .067 wide.[484]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMOREL (GUILLAUME), printer-bookseller at Paris, from 1548 to\r\n1564.--One mark, reproduced by M. Silvestre (no. 164), who informs me\r\nthat his engraver accidentally omitted the Lorraine cross. 'This mark,'\r\nhe adds, 'was used later by Estienne Prevosteau, Morel's son-in-law, who\r\nsubsequently reëngraved it, or had it reëngraved, with his initials, E. P.\r\nin place of Tory's mark.'[485] It represents a capital theta (Θ), about\r\nwhich are twined two winged serpents, and in the centre an angel, seated\r\non the cross-piece of the Θ, with a lighted torch in her hand.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNIVELLE (SEBASTIEN), printer and bookseller, at Paris, from 1550\r\nto 1601. One mark, representing two storks in the air, one being carried\r\nand fed by the other; with this verse from Exodus (XX, 12), to\r\nexplain the drawing: 'Honora patrem tuum et matrem tuam, et sis longævus\r\nsuper terram.' I have seen this mark on an octavo edition of St. John\r\nChrysostom ('Homeliæ duæ'), printed by Sebastien Nivelle in 1554. It is\r\nreproduced by M. Silvestre (no. 201), but the Lorraine cross is barely\r\nvisible on this impression. I have seen also another mark of Nivelle's\r\nrepresenting the same subject, with analogous designs suggesting filial\r\nlove in the four corners; but it is not signed with the cross although it\r\nis absolutely in Tory's manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNYVERD (GUILLAUME), printer and bookseller at Paris, from\r\n1516.--One mark, or, to speak more precisely, a small border in the style\r\nof one of the marks of Simon de Colines. At the foot, in a scroll, are the\r\nwords, 'Nasci, laborare, mori.' This border appears in a small pamphlet,\r\nundated, in pure gothic type, entitled, 'La Reformation des tavernes et\r\ndestruction de gourmandise, en forme de dialogue'; a small octavo of 4\r\nleaves, of which M. Cigogne possesses the only known copy (1856). At the\r\nend are the words, 'Paris, by Guillaume Nyverd, printer.' So that Lottin\r\nis mistaken in saying that he was a bookseller only. He gives only one\r\ndate for his career in the trade--1516--but our engraving is certainly\r\nlater than 1520. M. Silvestre extends Nyverd's business career to 1559, on\r\nwhat grounds I do not know; but he also calls him a bookseller only. The\r\ntext of the 'Reformation des tavernes,' etc., was reprinted on page 223\r\nof the second volume of the 'Recueil des poésies françoises des XV et XVI\r\nsiècles,' collected and annotated by M. Anatole de Montaiglon.[486]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNYVERD (GUILLAUME DE), probably the son of the preceding,\r\nprinter-bookseller at Paris, from 1550 to 1580.--One mark, representing\r\nthe arms of France borne by two winged genii. Above them a head with\r\nwings; from its mouth come two garlands in the style of those on the last\r\nplate of 'Champ fleury.' At the left, at the foot of the cut, the letters\r\nG. N., and at the right the Lorraine cross. This engraving, which is 8\r\ncentimetres wide by 11 high, was undoubtedly executed when Guillaume\r\nde Nyverd was appointed king's printer, which title he held in 1561,\r\naccording to Lottin. In all probability he held it earlier than that.\r\nHowever that may be, I have seen this mark, already much worn, in an\r\nimpression of 1572: 'Prognostication touchant le mariage du tres honoré et\r\ntres aimé Henry, par la grace de Dieu roy de Navarre, et de tres illustre\r\nprincesse Marguerite de France, calculée par maistre Bernard Abbatia,\r\ndocteur medecin et astrologue du tres chrestien roy de France' [Charles\r\nIX]. There are in the Bibliothèque Nationale at least three editions of\r\nthe little pamphlet, made by the same printer at about the same time,\r\nthat is to say immediately after the marriage of the King of Navarre with\r\nMarguerite de Valois. All three have this engraving on the last page, but\r\nin every case it is accompanied by an addition of much later date, namely,\r\nthe device of Charles IX (two pillars joined by a scroll containing the\r\nwords, 'Pietate et Jvsticia'), above the arms of France. The volume\r\ncontains also numerous other engravings and letters bearing Guillaume de\r\nNyverd's initials. It is worth while to call attention to the fact that de\r\nNyverd does not assume the title of king's printer in this book, although,\r\nas we have seen above, his appointment was of much earlier date.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPALLIER (JEAN), called 'Marchand,' printer and bookseller at\r\nMetz, from 1539 to 1548.--One mark (Silvestre, no. 156), representing a\r\nfleur-de-lis held in the air by two naked children, with the letters I. P.\r\nin the field.[487] Jean Pallier, or, better, Palyer (in Latin, Palierus),\r\ndid business also in Paris, for I have seen several books of his dated\r\nfrom that city in 1541 or 1542, with the mark described above. I will\r\nmention, among others: (1) 'Epitomæ singularum distinctionum libri primi\r\nsententiarum, cum versibus memorialibus Arnoldi Vesaliensis,' etc., 16mo,\r\nParis, 1541; and (2) 'Topica Marci Tullii Ciceronis,' etc., 'ex officina\r\nJoannis Palierii, e regione Navarræ, sub signo Leonis Coronati,' 4to,\r\n1542.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPARIS (NICOLE), printer at Troyes, from 1542 to 1547.--One mark\r\n(Silvestre, no. 175), representing a child clinging to the branches of a\r\npalm-tree (?), beneath the device, 'Et Colligam.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPERIER (CHARLES), bookseller at Paris, from 1550 to 1557.--One\r\nmark, found on the title of the folio entitled, 'Les quatre livres\r\nd'Albert Durer ... de la proportion des parties et pourtraicts des corps\r\nhumains, traduits par Louys Meigret,' etc., 'chez Charles Perier ... à\r\nl'enseigne du Bellerophon, 1557.'[488] This bookseller issued two editions\r\nof Dürer's book in the same year, one in Latin and the other in French,\r\nboth illustrated with the same cuts. I am unable to say which appeared\r\nfirst. He had already published, in 1555, for Louis Meigret, a translation\r\nof 'Les XII livres de Robert Valturin, touchans la discipline militaire,'\r\nin folio, with engravings, in which his mark appears, signed with the\r\ndouble cross. The sign of Bellerophon was retained by Charles Perier's son\r\nThomas.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPETIT (OUDIN), bookseller at Paris from 1541.--One mark\r\n(Silvestre, no. 103), representing a shield bearing a fleur-de-lis, and\r\nheld by two lions; in the field the letters O. P.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPORTE (MAURICE DE LA), bookseller at Paris from 1524 to\r\n1548.--One mark used by his widow in the volume entitled, 'M. A. Mureti\r\nJuvenilia'; octavo, 1553.[489] Maurice de la Porte's widow sold his plant\r\nto Gabriel Buon, who used the marks of the deceased from 1558 to 1587.\r\nThey represent a man carrying a valise at the door (_à la porte_) of a\r\nhouse; one of them has the device, 'Omnia mea mecum _porto_.' The man\r\nis Bias,[490] according to La Caille. About the same time there was a\r\nprinter at Lyon named Hugues de la Porte, whose mark represented Samson\r\ncarrying away the gates (_portes_) of Gaza in his arms, with the device,\r\n'Libertatem meam mecum _porto_.' (He also published a folio Latin Bible in\r\n1542.)[491]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPREVOSTEAU (ESTIENNE). See MOREL (GUILLAUME).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nREGNAULT (BARBE), bookseller at Paris from 1556 to about\r\n1560.--One mark, representing an elephant carrying a tower on his back,\r\nwith the device, 'Sicut elephas sto'; height 7½ centimetres, width 5½\r\ncentimetres. Barbe was undoubtedly the daughter of François Regnault,\r\nwho died in 1552, and who had a similar mark.[492] François Regnault's\r\nmark was retained by his widow, Madeleine Boursette, who added to it\r\nher initials, M. B., and did business in her own name until 1555. Barbe\r\nRegnault's mark first appears, so far as my knowledge goes, in a small\r\noctavo, printed about 1556, entitled, 'Description de la prinse de Calais\r\net de Guynes, composée par forme de style de proces par M. G. de M.' (Here\r\nthe mark.) 'A Paris, chez Barbe Regnault, rue Sainct-Jacques, à l'enseigne\r\nde l'Elephant.'[493] La Caille informs us of other works published\r\nabout the same time by Barbe Regnault: 'Monstre d'abus contre Michel\r\nNostradamus,' 1558; J. Seve, 'Supplication aux rois,' ... 'de faire la\r\npaix entre eux,' 1559. In 1560 she published a book by Estienne Brulefer,\r\nin octavo, entitled, 'Identitatum et distinctionum ... traditarum\r\ncompendiosa contractio'; then comes the mark, and below it an imprint\r\nin which Barbe styles herself the widow of André Barthelin.[494] I am\r\nunable to say whether this is the same man whom La Caille and Lottin call\r\nAndré Berthelin, and who published in 1544 a work entitled, 'Francisci\r\nGeorgii Venali ... de Harmonia mundi totius cantica tria'; folio, Paris,\r\n'apud Andream Berthelin, via ad divum Jacobum, in domo Guilelmi Rolandi,\r\nsub insigne Aureæ Coronæ, et in vico Longobardorum in domo ejusdem\r\nRolandi.'[495] If he is the same man, we must assume that he was not yet\r\nmarried to Barbe Regnault, for we see that, while he lived, as she did,\r\non rue Saint-Jacques, he had a different sign. Indeed, I am inclined to\r\nthink that Barbe did not adopt the 'Elephant' until after the death of\r\nMadeleine Boursette, François Regnault's widow, about 1556. However that\r\nmay be, La Caille says that Barbe Regnault's mark passed into the hands\r\nof Thibault Bessault, then to his son Jean, and finally to Antoine Houic.\r\nI have seen a book published by the last-named in 1582, embellished with\r\nBarbe Regnault's 'Elephant.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nROBINOT (GILLES I), bookseller at Paris, from 1554 to 1575.--One\r\nmark (Silvestre, no. 686), representing Icarus hurled into the sea for not\r\nfollowing the advice of Dædalus, his father, not to approach too near the\r\nsun lest that luminary should melt the wax with which the wings of our\r\npresumptuous youth were fastened to his body. In a scroll are these words,\r\n'Ne quid nimis.' This mark was used as late as 1619 by Gilles Robinot the\r\nsecond, son of the first Gilles[496]; it is .05 of a millimetre high by\r\n.047 wide. See SERTENAS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nROFFET (PIERRE), called 'Le Faulchoir,' bookseller at Paris,\r\nfrom 1525 to 1537.--One mark (Silvestre, no. 150) representing a mower\r\n(_faucheur_) appears in a book printed in 1536.[497]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nROIGNY (JEAN DE), bookseller at Paris, from 1529 to 1562.--I\r\nknow two marks of de Roigny, signed with the Lorraine cross. The older is\r\nthe one that appears in a superb edition of Pliny's 'Letters,' printed\r\nby Josse Bade in 1533, in folio (Silvestre, no. 674).[498] It represents\r\na man and a woman, each holding a scroll containing a Latin motto; the\r\nman's reads thus: 'Nec me labor iste gravabit'; and the woman's, 'Spes\r\npremii solatium est laboris.' In the sky is Fortune with her wheel\r\nand the horn of plenty, and this device in a scroll beneath: 'Quod\r\ndiffertur non aufertur.' The second mark, which was adopted by Jean de\r\nRoigny after the death of his father-in-law, Josse Bade, in 1535, is the\r\n'Prelum ascensianum,' but reëngraved (Silvestre, no. 787); for Bade's\r\ntypographical plant passed into the hands of another son-in-law of his,\r\nMichel de Vascosan, who continued to use his father-in-law's old woodcuts,\r\nespecially his mark, badly worn as it was. As for Robert Estienne, Bade's\r\nthird son-in-law, his father-in-law's death caused no change in his\r\ntypographical arrangements; he still retained the 'Olive-tree' which he\r\nhas made so celebrated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSERTENAS (VINCENT), bookseller at Paris, from 1534 to 1561.--One\r\nmark, which was used on two opuscula, in octavo, of 1561; they are usually\r\nbound in the same volume, and are entitled: (1) 'Régime de vivre et\r\nconservation des corps humains,' etc.; (2) 'Recueil de plusieurs secrets\r\ntrès-utiles pour la santé,' etc. This mark represents the initials V. S.\r\ninterlaced, in a medallion above which is the sun, with a genie on each\r\nside; and below, the device, 'Vincenti non victo.' We also find Robinot's\r\nmark, described above, in certain books published by Sertenas. I will\r\nmention among others the 'Recueil des rimes et proses, by E. P.; octavo,\r\n1555.[499] Presumably, it was because Robinot was the printer that he\r\nplaced his mark on the books.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVIVIAN (THIELMAN), bookseller at Paris in 1539.--One mark\r\n(Silvestre, no. 725), which appears in the second part of the 'Grand\r\nMarial de la mère de vie,'[500] translated by Adam de Saint-Victor. This\r\nsecond part is entitled, 'A la très-pure et immaculée Conception de la\r\nVierge'; quarto, 1539. Vivian lived in Clos Bruneau; his mark bore this\r\ndevice, 'Post tenebras spero lucem' in a scroll, above a fountain guarded\r\nby two unicorns; below are the letters T. V., and still lower, 'Thielman\r\nVivian.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THIELMAN VIVIAN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 448: _Champ fleury_, folio 43 verso.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 449: Eloi Gibier used previously a similar mark, which bore\r\nthe following device: 'In sudore vultus tui vesceris pane tuo.'

[Reproduced on p. 198.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 469: The placing of these arms on the typographical mark of\r\nGilles de Gourmont proves, in contradiction of the common opinion, that\r\nthe printer's trade was not degrading. (But see what I have said on this\r\nsubject in my book on the _Origin of Printing_, vol. i, p. 210, and vol.\r\nii, p. 89.) The Gourmonts of Paris were in fact descended from a noble\r\nfamily of the Cotentin, which may still be in existence, and which bore\r\nthe same arms in the seventeenth century. Gilles de Gourmont had taken\r\nup his abode in Paris in the last years of the fifteenth century, as had\r\nseveral of his brothers, who practised the same trade. The oldest, Robert,\r\nappears in that city as early as 1498; Jean, who was younger than Gilles,\r\nnot until 1507. We hear also of a Jérôme and a Benoît as booksellers in\r\nParis in the middle of the sixteenth century. I do not know what their\r\nrelationship to the earlier men was. Perhaps they were sons of Robert.\r\n(Benoît, who married Catherine Goulard, had a son baptized by the name of\r\nGilles at the church of Sainte-Croix-en-la-Cité, on October 9, 1546.) We\r\nalso find a Jean Théobald de Gourmont at Antwerp in 1527. As for Gilles,\r\nhe was engaged in bookselling and printing from 1506 to about 1533, and\r\nleft two sons, Jean and François, who retained his establishment on rue\r\nSaint-Jean-de-Latran, and printed there, in 1587, the _Tableaux des Arts\r\nLibéraux de Christophe de Savigny_. This is an in-plano, at the beginning\r\nof which is a superb engraving representing the arms of the family [as\r\ndescribed in the text]. This remarkable work, which bears the monogram\r\nof the two brothers, was probably executed by Jean, the elder, who was a\r\npainter and engraver. The Musée du Louvre has a picture supposed to be by\r\nhim (_Notice des tableaux du Louvre_, part 3, p. 156); he is the author\r\nof a fine portrait of the Cardinal de Bourbon, mentioned by Mariette and\r\nnow in the Cabinet des Estampes; he is mentioned also by Abbé de Marolles\r\nand by Papillon for certain pictures of equestrian groups and bits of\r\ndecoration. His mark (formed of the letters I D G entwined) and the name\r\naccompanying it are found on several pieces cited by Brulliot, on the\r\nplates of a Bible of 1560, and on certain pieces of Tortorel and Perissim\r\n(Renouvier, _Maîtres Graveurs du Seizième Siècle_, p. 195 ).

The recent researches of my\r\nfriend M. Hippolyte Boyer, Deputy Archivist of the Department of the Cher,\r\nmake it possible for me to make known his grandfather, his father, and all\r\nhis brothers and sisters.\r\n\r\n'By deed of December 29, 1486, Robert Thory, husbandman, living in the\r\nparish of Saint-Germain-du-Puy, conveys to Jean Thory, his brother, for 20\r\nlivres tournois, his share in the heritage of the late Jean and Jeanne,\r\ntheir father and mother.'\r\n\r\n'By contracts of September 5 and 8, 1507, Jean Thory, of Saint-Privé,[501]\r\nand Philippe _Thoreye_, his wife, give their two daughters, Jehanne Thorye\r\nand Perron Thorye, in marriage to Thevenin and François Leconte, sons of\r\nJean Leconte.' Among the provisions of Perron's contract is one to the\r\neffect that Jean Thory and his wife settle a dowry of 40 livres tournois\r\non their daughter: 'and this in satisfaction of all claim upon father and\r\nmother, be it in respect of furniture or of inheritance, which said claim\r\nthe said future bride, with the authority of her said future husband,\r\nhath renounced and doth by these presents renounce, in favour of her\r\nfather and mother, of _maistre Geoffroye_, André, Antoine and Michell\r\nThoris, children of said Jean and Philippe, save for the power to,'\r\netc.[502]\r\n\r\nThus it appears that Geofroy was the oldest of the brothers and sisters,\r\nas he is named first in the document. Now, as two of his sisters were of\r\nmarriageable age in 1507, and as he is called _maistre_, it is probable\r\nthat he himself was more than twenty-five. That is why I have placed his\r\nbirth about 1480.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Of his Descendants._\r\n\r\nJean Toubeau, printer and bookseller at Bourges, who died at Paris in\r\n1685, while on a mission for his native place,[503] wrote the following\r\nin the preface to his 'Institutes consulaires,' printed by himself in\r\n1682, three years before his death: 'I have not been impelled to undertake\r\nand write this work by the examples of the illustrious members of my\r\nprofession. Nor is it the example of those of my own family who have given\r\ntheir works to the public: Geofroy Tory, professor in the University\r\nof Paris, and a printer and bookseller in the same city, who was so\r\nprolific that, proposing to put forth a book which should teach the scope\r\nand proportions of those beautiful roman letters which we use to-day\r\nin printing, he could not forbear to produce a book overflowing with\r\nlearning, which was followed by numerous others of instruction, which are\r\nso well known that it is needless to give a list of them here, especially\r\nas M. de la Thaumassière gives them a whole chapter in our history.'\r\n\r\nIt is evident from this passage that Toubeau was related to Tory, but it\r\nis not clear how the relationship came about; and La Thaumassière does\r\nnot mention Tory in his 'Histoire du Berry,' printed a few years later\r\nby François Toubeau, Jean's son, despite the promises which he seems to\r\nhave made to Jean, who had transferred to him the duty of making known to\r\nposterity that illustrious son of his province.\r\n\r\nThe only author able to assist us at all in our investigations is Moréri,\r\nwho, in the article on Jean Toubeau in his great historical dictionary,\r\nsays that he was the great-great-grandson of Tory, on his mother's side.\r\nThis statement should be exact, and the article appears to be written from\r\ninformation furnished by the Toubeau family; but all that we can determine\r\nfrom it is that Toubeau was a descendant of Tory in the fourth degree.\r\nWhether he descended from a son or daughter of Geofroy, I have been\r\nunable to discover. To elucidate this fact, I wrote to M. Auguste Toubeau,\r\njudge of the civil court at Bourges, and this was his reply, dated March\r\n5, 1856: 'I should have been glad to give you the information you desire\r\nabout Tory. But I have no documents or family papers which establish his\r\nrelationship to Jean and Hilaire Toubeau. I do not know what connection\r\nthere was between them and Tory, and I learned that there was such a\r\nconnection only from what Moréri says of it.'\r\n\r\nFailing family papers, I made fruitless efforts to fix the relationship\r\nbetween the Toubeaus and Tory. Finding it impossible to reach any certain\r\nresult, I have abandoned this search, which has no bearing upon the\r\nhistory of our illustrious typographer. The Toubeaus alone are interested\r\nin the solution of the question; I leave to them the task of proving their\r\nkinship.\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT.--It may be surmised that Bonaventure _Torinus_,\r\nbookseller of Bourges, who caused to be printed at that city, in 1595, by\r\nthe widow of Nicolas Levez, the 'Epitome juris civilis,' by an unknown\r\nauthor, and 'Julii Pauli receptarum sententiarum libri V,'[504] was Tory's\r\nson, for he wrote his name in Latin in the same way that Tory wrote it;\r\nbut was it from a daughter of Tory or from a daughter of this Bonaventure\r\nthat Toubeau descended? It is impossible for me to say. The lateness of\r\nthe period at which Bonaventure makes his appearance leads me to believe\r\nthat he did not see the light until Tory had reached an advanced age.\r\nIndeed, if we compare the dates, we shall find that this son of Tory\r\ncannot have come into the world before 1530, for, starting from that year,\r\nhe would have been sixty-five years old in 1595, when his 'Epitome juris'\r\nwas printed, and there is no reason to believe that he died very soon\r\nthereafter. For my own part, I believe that he was not born until after\r\nthe publication of 'Champ fleury,' and that his Christian name was an\r\nallusion to his late birth.[505] In that case, we can understand why he\r\ndid not succeed to the paternal establishment: he was only two or three\r\nyears old at Geofroy's death--too young to think of taking his place; so\r\nthat that duty fell to Geofroy's pupils, whoever they may have been. As\r\nfor Bonaventure, the family traditions naturally led him back to Bourges,\r\nand the trade that he adopted brought him still nearer to his father.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nVERSES IN HONOUR OF GEOFROY TORY, PRINTED AT THE HEAD OF PALSGRAVE'S\r\nGRAMMAR.[506]\r\n\r\n'Ejusdem [Leonardi] Coxi ad eruditum virum Gefridum TROY[507] de\r\nBurges[508] Gallum, Campi floridi authorem, quem ille sua lingua Champ\r\nfleury vocat, nomine omnium Anglorum, phaleutium.\r\n\r\n    'Campo quod toties, Gefride docte,\r\n    'In florente tuo cupisti habemus.\r\n    'Nam sub legibus hic bene approbatis\r\n    'Sermo gallicus ecce perdocetur.\r\n    'Non rem grammaticam Palæmon ante\r\n    'Tractarat melius suis latinis,\r\n    'Quotquot floruerant ve posterorum,\r\n    'Nec Græcis melius putato Gazam\r\n    'Instruxisse suos libris politis,\r\n    'Seu quotquot prætio prius fuere,\r\n    'Quam nunc gallica iste noster tradit.\r\n    'Est doctus, facilis, brevisque quantum\r\n    'Res permittit, et inde nos ovamus,\r\n    'Campo quod toties, Gefride docte,\r\n    'In florente tuo cupisti, habentes.'\r\n\r\n\r\n_Remarks on the foregoing lines._\r\n\r\nThe numerous errors of all sorts which disfigure Palsgrave's book (a very\r\ninteresting book, none the less)--errors of which the foregoing lines\r\nafford several specimens--should have humbled to some extent the national\r\nvanity of the author, who cries out incessantly, throughout his bulky\r\nvolume, against the ignorance of French printers. He should, in any event,\r\nhave remembered that English typography was the very humble daughter of\r\nFrench typography, which latter not only trained the first English artist\r\n(Caxton), but also gave him his two most illustrious successors,--Wynkyn\r\nde Worde and Pinson,--the last named of whom did in fact print a part of\r\nPalsgrave's book.\r\n\r\nA modern Englishman, David Baker, has gone even farther than Palsgrave; he\r\nsays, speaking of Palsgrave's work: 'the French nation, so proud to-day of\r\nthe universality of its language, seems to owe it to England.' To which M.\r\nGénin retorts: 'Baker reasons backward. The French language did not come\r\ninto universal use because it pleased Palsgrave to write a grammar; on\r\nthe contrary, Palsgrave composed his grammar because the French language\r\nwas already universal. This universality was a fact, admitted before\r\nPalsgrave's birth,[509] and others before him had tried to draw up rules\r\nto facilitate the study of French by foreigners. Palsgrave names three to\r\nwhom he acknowledges that his work is greatly indebted.\r\n\r\n'Leonard Coxe exults more modestly and with more propriety than David\r\nBaker, for he seems to attribute to Geofroy Tory the honour of having\r\ncalled forth Palsgrave's grammar. To be sure, a comparison of dates seems\r\nto leave little likelihood to that conjecture, for the Frenchman's work\r\nand the Englishman's are only about a year apart; but I must notice here\r\none curious fact which has not been noticed by the bibliographers. On the\r\ntitle-page of the English book we find the date 1530, and on the last\r\nleaf, \"Printing completed July 18, 1530.\" But the king's licence to print,\r\nat the beginning of the volume, is dated, \"At our Castle of Ampthill,\r\nthe second of September, in the year of our reign the XXII.\"\r\nNow, as Henry VIII succeeded to the throne in 1509, after Easter, the\r\ntwenty-second year of his reign was the year 1531,[510] and \"Champ fleury\"\r\nappeared early in 1529. So that this gives us an interval of three\r\nyears.[511] In this view Leonard Coxe's words have genuine force, and the\r\npoint of concurrence which Palsgrave congratulates himself upon finding\r\nin \"Champ fleury\" and \"Lesclaircissement\" may not be so fortuitous as he\r\nchooses to state.'\r\n\r\nHowever, as M. Génin goes on to say, 'this honour, claimed by the English,\r\nof having been the first to write upon the French language, is, all things\r\nconsidered, simply an act of homage to France; for if our neighbours had\r\nawaited from a foreign nation the first book on the English language,\r\nperhaps they would be awaiting it still.'\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTORY ADMITTED AS THE TWENTY-FIFTH BOOKSELLER TO THE UNIVERSITY.\r\n\r\nIn the 'Acta Facultatis medicinæ Parisiensis,'[512] at the end, we read as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n'Die Martis 18 febr. 1532 [1533, n. s.]....\r\n\r\n'Die sabbati sequenti, vocata est Universitas in ecclesia Mathurinorum,\r\nsuper tribus articulis: clausione rotuli, resignatione cure Sanctorum\r\nCosme et Damiani, et receptione vigesimi quinti librarii Universitatis.\r\nClausus est rotulus solito more; admissa est resignatio permutationis\r\ncausa et sine prejudicio turni, et admissus est vigesimus quintus\r\nlibrarius Gauffridus Torier [_sic_], dono regio. Ubi supplicavit magister\r\nJacobus Japhet pro pastillaria.'\r\n\r\n    (_Translation._)\r\n\r\n    'On the following Saturday [February 22, 1533], the University was\r\n    called together at the Church of the Mathurins. There were three\r\n    articles in the order of the day: Closing of the register [of\r\n    benefices]; resignation of the curé of Saint-Come and Saint-Damien;\r\n    reception of a twenty-fifth bookseller to the University. The\r\n    register was closed according to the usual form. The resignation\r\n    was accepted, by way of exchange, without prejudice to the next\r\n    in turn. Geofroy Tory was admitted as twenty-fifth bookseller, by\r\n    presentation of the king. At this same session Maître Jacques Japhet\r\n    prayed for leave to present his \"pastillary\" thesis.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe only item that interests us in this extract from the proceedings of\r\nthe Faculty of Medicine is the passage relating to Tory. We see that in\r\n1533 he was made the twenty-fifth bookseller to the University, by command\r\nof King François I. Up to that time there had been only twenty-four (see\r\nM. Didot's 'Essai,' col. 744), and they undoubtedly went back to that\r\nconsecrated number after the death of Tory, in whose behalf an exception\r\nhad been made.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nNOTE CONCERNING TORY'S VARIOUS DOMICILES IN PARIS.\r\n\r\nThe dedicatory epistle of Tory's edition of Pomponius Mela is dated Paris,\r\nDecember, 1507; but it mentions no place of abode.\r\n\r\nThe edition of the 'Cosmography' of Pope Pius II is dated at the Collège\r\ndu Plessis, October 2, 1509. Tory was at the Collège du Plessis as late as\r\nMay 10, 1510.[513]\r\n\r\nOn August 18, 1512, we find him installed at the Collège Coqueret; and a\r\nlittle later at the Collège de Bourgogne.[514]\r\n\r\nAbout 1518, having joined the fraternity of booksellers, he went to live\r\non rue Saint-Jacques, opposite the Écu de Bâle, which was then used as a\r\nsign by the famous printer Chrétien Wechel. The latter's establishment was\r\non the right going up rue Saint-Jacques, near the church of Saint-Benoît.\r\n\r\nAbout 1526 Tory established himself on the Petit-Pont, near Hôtel-Dieu,\r\nbut did not give up his shop on rue Saint-Jacques, at the sign of the Pot\r\nCassé.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1531, he changed his abode to rue de la Juiverie, the Halle aux\r\nBlés de Beauce, where he set up his printing-press and his bookstall. He\r\nretained his shop on rue Saint-Jacques for some time.[515] It was in his\r\nhouse on rue de la Juiverie that he died, in 1533.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nOF THE FIRST USE BY PRINTERS, AND IN THE FRENCH LANGUAGE, OF THE\r\nAPOSTROPHE, THE ACCENT, AND THE CEDILLA.\r\n\r\nM. Francis Wey, in a report made by him to the Philological section of the\r\nCommittee on the Language, History, and Arts of France, on June 9, 1856,\r\nand published in the 9th fascicle of volume three of that Committee's\r\n'Bulletin' (page 437), seems to attribute to Jean Salomon, otherwise\r\ncalled Montflory, or Florimond, the first philological dissertation\r\nin which there is any mention of the accent, the apostrophe and the\r\ncedilla,--signs peculiar to the French language, which, as every one\r\nknows, was for many years content with the alphabet of the Latin tongue,\r\nfrom which it descended; more than that, he attributes to that author the\r\nfirst use of these signs in a printed book. In both respects the honour\r\nis due to Geofroy Tory. In truth, in his 'Champ fleury,'--which was not\r\npublished until 1529, it is true, although begun in 1523, the license\r\nto print being dated September 5, 1526,--Tory proposed to introduce the\r\naccent, the apostrophe, and the cedilla into the French language; he\r\ndid more than that; for, having become a printer, he was the first to\r\nintroduce those signs into typography. They appeared for the first time in\r\nthe last of the four editions of the 'Adolescence Clementine' (by Clement\r\nMarot), all four of which he published. This fourth edition appeared June\r\n7, 1533, accompanied by an 'avis' in these words: 'With certain accents\r\nnoted, to wit, on the _é_ masculine, different from the feminine,[516]\r\non letters joined by synalephe, and under the _c_ when it is pronounced\r\nlike _s_, the which for lack of counsel has never been done in the French\r\nlanguage, albeit it was and is most essential.' This was the first work\r\nin which Tory applied his orthographic system, as may be seen by the\r\ninexperience of the compositors in his employ, who made several errors of\r\nomission and transposition in this very notice.\r\n\r\nThis so necessary reform spread very rapidly, thanks to the fact that the\r\nnecessity had already made itself felt, as is proved by the work of Jean\r\nSalomon, published in that same year 1533. But it is Tory's especial glory\r\nthat only those changes which were proposed by him were retained, save a\r\nfew orthographic signs which have no other purpose than to distinguish\r\nwords spelled alike but of different meanings--and these signs were\r\nintroduced later: a, à; ou, où; du, dû, etc.\r\n\r\nWith however good a will one might seek to deny Tory's precedence in the\r\nuse of orthographic signs in the French tongue, and to award it to Jean\r\nSalomon, who used them in the same year, there are two facts that decide\r\nthe question in favour of the former: these are, the publication in April,\r\n1529, of his 'Champ fleury' (the first book of which is entitled, 'An\r\nexhortation to fix and ordain the French language by certain rules for\r\nspeaking with elegance in good sound French words'), and the formulation\r\nof the 'General rules of orthography of the French language,' no copy of\r\nwhich is known to exist, it is true, but for which Tory obtained a license\r\nto print on September 28, 1529, four years before Salomon's work appeared.\r\n\r\nNor must we lose sight of the fact that Tory was from Bourges, that is to\r\nsay, from the same province as Jacques Thiboust, Seigneur de Quantilly,\r\n'friend of books, and distinguished penman,' who was Jean Salomon's\r\nMæcenas. There is nothing improbable in the supposition that Thiboust had\r\nhad his interest aroused by Tory, who is likely to have been a crony of\r\nThiboust in Paris by a two-fold claim,--as a Berrichon and as a 'friend\r\nof books.' It seems to me that the alias 'Montflory' assumed by Salomon\r\nis an allusion to 'Champ fleury.' That, in my opinion, is why he wrote\r\nit 'Montflory' or 'Florimond,' indifferently, the word being an anagram\r\nrather than a real surname.\r\n\r\nAs the opportunity offers itself, I will add to M. Francis Wey's notes a\r\nfew remarks which may some day assist in writing the biography of Jean\r\nSalomon, of whom nothing is known except the fact, told us by himself,\r\nthat he was an Angevin.\r\n\r\nWe know now of three different editions of his work. The first, dated\r\n1533, with no indication of the month, was printed in that year in three\r\npages and a half, octavo, under this title: 'Briefve doctrine pour\r\ndeuement escripre selon la propriete du langaige francoys.' We do not know\r\nwhere or by whom it was published, but it certainly was printed at Paris,\r\nwhere Salomon undoubtedly lived, and probably by Antoine Augereau, as was\r\nthe one next described, which seems to have been modelled upon it. Indeed,\r\nlike it, it is generally found between the same covers with an edition of\r\nthe 'Miroir de l'âme pécheresse' (of Marguerite of Navarre),--an edition\r\nwithout date, name of place or of printer, which, therefore, should also\r\nbe attributed to Antoine Augereau and to the year 1533. This edition,\r\nwhich M. Brunet does not mention,[517] has on the first page: 'Le Miroir\r\nde lame pecheresse, auquel elle recongnoit ses fautes et pechez, aussi\r\nles graces et benefices a elle faictz par Jesuchrist son espoux.' It\r\nconsists of nine half sheets in octavo, printed as four (signatures _a_\r\nto _i_). On the last leaf is a note to the reader wherein forgiveness is\r\nasked for the first corrector (he who is called to-day 'the corrector\r\nof first proofs'), who has inadvertently omitted three verses. 'Divers\r\nother trivial errors may peradventure be found before or after, but they\r\nmust needs be charged rather to the variety of the copies than to the\r\nnegligence of the correctors or to the haste of the printers.'--As I\r\nhave said, it is at the end of this pamphlet that we find printed, with\r\nseparate signatures of its own, from _a_ to _d_, the little book described\r\nby M. Wey after the copy in the Bibliothèque Nationale which contains the\r\n'Briefve doctrine.' But one essential point, which M. Wey has forgotten to\r\nmention, is that in the first edition not a word is said of the accent or\r\nthe cedilla; there is no mention of anything except the apostrophe.\r\n\r\nThe second edition, printed at Paris by Antoine Augereau, in December,\r\n1533, at the back of another edition of the 'Miroir de l'âme pécheresse'\r\n(called 'Miroir de tres chrestienne princesse Marguerite, reine de\r\nNavare'), is two-thirds larger. It was probably published (like the\r\npreceding one) by the Queen of Navarre's secretary, Jean Thiboust, after a\r\nmanuscript which the author had dedicated to him as his Mæcenas. Indeed,\r\nwe find at the head of this reprint the words 'ex manuscriptis authoris,'\r\nwhich seems to indicate further that the author was dead. A point worth\r\nnoting is that the 'Briefve doctrine' again forms a part of an appendix\r\ndistinguished by separate signature letters (and folios) from Marguerite's\r\npoem, and bearing the same title as in the earlier print, despite\r\nthe additions that had been made to it (presumably based upon Tory's\r\npublications), especially with respect to the cedilla and the accent,\r\nwhich, moreover, are used throughout the volume.\r\n\r\nThe third is the one which is still in manuscript at Bourges. It contains\r\nseveral passages more than the preceding; but these passages, which are\r\nof very debateable merit (as M. Wey, who reproduces them in his report,\r\ndeclares), were probably added by one Jean Milon, of Arlenc in Auvergne,\r\ncalling himself a retainer ('serviteur') of Thiboust, who revised the\r\n'Briefve doctrine' about 1542; so much at least we may infer from the\r\ndate of some other pieces in the collection containing it, which was\r\npresented, in 1555, by Jacques Thiboust to the Collège de Bourges, whence\r\nit found its way to the public library of the same city. It is exceedingly\r\ninteresting to find this document in Geofroy Tory's native place. It\r\nis as if chance had chosen thereby to remind us of the source of the\r\northographic reform proposed by Jean Salomon.\r\n\r\nTo be entirely fair, we ought to say that certain other writers had even\r\nanticipated Salomon. Thus Jacobus Silvius, otherwise called Jacques\r\nDubois, had published through Robert Estienne, on the 7th of the Ides\r\nof January, 1531 (January 7, 1532, n. s.), a French grammar in Latin,\r\nwherein he suggested a complete system of orthographic reform, including\r\nthe acute accent, the apostrophe, the cedilla, etc.; but his plan was so\r\ncomplicated that it could not be followed in its entirety. Moreover, the\r\nsigns proposed by him were, for the most part, impossible of adoption\r\nthroughout a book. For instance, the cedilla consisted of an _s_ placed\r\nabout the _c_. The merit of Tory's system, over and above its priority,\r\nwas its simplicity. So we may say that it was generally adopted after 1533.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nTRANSLATION OF THE LETTERS PATENT OF FRANÇOIS I, APPOINTING CONRAD\r\nNÉOBAR KING'S PRINTER FOR GREEK.[518]\r\n\r\n    January 17, 1539 [new style].\r\n\r\nFrançois, by the grace of God King of the French, to the French nation,\r\ngreeting.[519]\r\n\r\nWe desire that it be known to one and all that our dearest wish is, and\r\nhas ever been, to accord to letters our support and especial favour, and\r\nto do our utmost endeavours to supply the young with useful studies.\r\nWe are persuaded that such useful studies will produce in our realm\r\ntheologians who will teach the blessed doctrines of religion; magistrates\r\nwho will execute the laws, not with passion, but in a spirit of public\r\nequity; and skilful administrators, the glory of the State, who will not\r\nhesitate to sacrifice their private interests to love of the public weal.\r\n\r\nSuch are in effect the advantages which we are justified in anticipating\r\nfrom worthy studies almost alone. And that is why we did, not long since,\r\nmake liberal allotments of stipends to distinguished scholars that they\r\nmight teach the young the languages and sciences, and train them in the no\r\nless valuable practice of good morals. But we have considered that there\r\nwas still lacking, in order to hasten the onward march of literature,\r\nsomething no less essential than public instruction, namely, that a\r\ncapable person should be specially entrusted with the matter of printing\r\nin Greek, under our auspices and with due encouragement from us, in order\r\nto the correct printing of Greek authors for the use of the young people\r\nof our realm.\r\n\r\nIn truth men distinguished in letters have represented to us that the\r\narts, history, morality, philosophy, and almost all other branches of\r\nknowledge, flow from the Greek authors as streams flow from their sources.\r\nWe know likewise that, Greek being more difficult to print than French\r\nand Latin, it is indispensable for the successful administration of a\r\nprinting establishment of this sort, that the director thereof should be\r\nwell versed in the Greek tongue, extremely painstaking, and blessed with\r\nabundant means; that it may be that there is not a single person among\r\nthe printers of our realm who combines all these qualifications (that is\r\nto say, knowledge of the Greek language, painstaking energy and large\r\nwealth), but that in one the fortune is lacking, in another the necessary\r\nknowledge, and in others still different conditions. For those men who\r\npossess at once wealth and learning prefer to pursue any other occupation\r\nrather than turn their hands to typography, which demands a most toilsome\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nAccordingly we instructed several scholars whom we admit to our table or\r\nto our intimacy, to point out to us a man overflowing with zeal for the\r\nart of typography, and of proved learning and diligence, who, supported by\r\nour generosity, should be employed to print Greek books.\r\n\r\nAnd we have a two-fold motive in thus serving the cause of study. Firstly,\r\nas we hold this realm from the All-powerful God, which realm is abundantly\r\nsupplied with wealth and with all the conveniences of life, we choose that\r\nit shall yield to no other in respect to the profundity of its studies,\r\nthe favour accorded to men of letters, and the variety and extent of the\r\ninstruction provided; secondly, in order that the studious youth, knowing\r\nour good-will toward them, and the honour which it is our delight to\r\nbestow upon learning, may give themselves with the greater ardour to the\r\nstudy of letters and of the sciences, and that men of worth, incited by\r\nour example, may redouble their zeal and efforts to train our youth to\r\ngoodly and useful studies.\r\n\r\nAnd even as we sought the person to whom we could with all confidence\r\nentrust this function, Conrad Néobar presented himself most opportunely,\r\nbeing most desirous to obtain some public employment which should\r\nplace him under our protection, and confer upon him personal benefits\r\nproportioned to the importance of his service; and, acting upon the\r\ntestimony that has been laid before us of his learning and his skill, by\r\nmen of letters well known to us, it has pleased us to entrust to him the\r\nmatter of Greek typography, to the end that he may print correctly in our\r\nkingdom, supported by our munificence, those Greek manuscripts which are\r\nthe source of all learning.\r\n\r\nBut, desiring to provide at the same time for the public service, and\r\nin order to forestall any possible fraud to the prejudice of Néobar our\r\nprinter, we establish him in his said office upon the following rules and\r\nconditions:--\r\n\r\nFirstly, we understand that all works not yet printed shall not be put\r\nto press, still less published, before they have been submitted to the\r\njudgement of our professors of the Académie of Paris who are charged with\r\nthe instruction of the young; so that the examination of works in profane\r\nliterature shall be entrusted to the professors of belles-lettres, and of\r\nthose on religious subjects to the professors of theology. By this means\r\nthe purity of our most sacred religion will be preserved from superstition\r\nand heresy, and integrity of morals be removed beyond the reach of the\r\ndebasement and contagion of vice.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Conrad Néobar will deposit in our library a copy of all editions\r\nof Greek texts which he shall first put forth, to the end that, in the\r\nevent of some occurrence calamitous to letters, posterity will have this\r\nsource to draw upon to repair the loss of books.\r\n\r\nThirdly, all such books as Néobar may print shall contain an express\r\nstatement that he is our _printer for the Greek_, and that he is specially\r\nentrusted with Greek printing under our auspices; to the end that not the\r\npresent age alone, but all posterity, may learn of the zeal and good-will\r\nfor letters whereby we are moved, and that, inspired by our example, it\r\nmay, like ourselves, prove itself disposed to strengthen the cause of\r\nstudy and contribute to its progress.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, inasmuch as this office is of more benefit to the State than\r\nany other, and as it demands from the man who desires to perform its\r\nduties zealously such assiduous care and attention that he can not have\r\na single moment to devote to labours which might lead him to honours or\r\nto wealth, we have chosen to provide in three ways for the interest and\r\nsupport of our printer Néobar.\r\n\r\nFirstly, we award him an annual stipend of one hundred gold crowns, called\r\n'écus au soleil,' by way of encouragement and to indemnify him in part for\r\nhis expenses. It is our will, further, that he be exempt from all imposts\r\nand that he enjoy the other privileges which we and our predecessors have\r\naccorded the clergy and the Académie of Paris, so that he may enjoy the\r\ngreater advantage from the disposal of his books and that he may the\r\nmore easily acquire all that is essential for a printing establishment.\r\nFinally, we forbid everybody, printers and booksellers alike, to print or\r\nto sell, in our realm, for the term of five years, such books in foreign\r\ntongues, whether Latin or Greek, as Conrad Néobar shall have published\r\nfirst, and for the term of two years such books as he shall have reprinted\r\nmore correctly, from ancient manuscripts, whether by his own labours or by\r\navailing himself of the work of other scholars.\r\n\r\nWhoever violates the terms hereof shall be punishable with a fine for\r\nthe use of the treasury, and shall reimburse our printer all the cost of\r\nhis editions. Furthermore, we command the provost of our city of Paris,\r\nor his lieutenant, as well as all other magistrates now in office, or\r\nwho hold public employments from us, to see to it that Conrad Néobar,\r\nour printer, enjoys to the full all the privileges and immunities hereby\r\nconferred upon him, and to inflict severe punishment upon whoever shall\r\ncause him annoyance or hindrance in the performance of his duties: for\r\nit is our will that he be protected from the evil-disposed and from the\r\nmalice of the envious, to the end that the tranquillity and security of an\r\nunharrassed life may enable him to devote himself with the greater zeal to\r\nhis important duties.\r\n\r\nAnd that full and entire credence may be forever given to what is\r\nhereinbefore commanded, we have confirmed it with our signature and have\r\ncaused our seal to be affixed. Adieu.\r\n\r\nGiven at Paris, the seventeenth day of January, in the year of grace 1538,\r\nand of our reign the twenty-fifth.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nEXTRACT FROM THE LETTERS PATENT OF FRANÇOIS I, APPOINTING DENIS JANOT\r\nKING'S PRINTER.[520]\r\n\r\nFrançois, by the grace of God King of France, to all those who shall see\r\nthese letters, greeting. Be it known that we, having been well and duly\r\nadvised of the great skill and experience which our dear and well-beloved\r\nDenis Janot has acquired in the art of printing and in the matters which\r\ndepend thereon, whereof he has ordinarily made great profession, and even\r\nin the French language; and considering that we have already engaged and\r\nconstituted two printers of our own, one for the Latin, the other for\r\nthe Greek language; desiring to do no less honour to our own than to the\r\nsaid two other languages, and to commit the printing thereof to some\r\nperson who is able to acquit himself thereof, as we hope that the said\r\nJanot will prove himself well able to do, for these causes and others\r\nmoving us thereto, we have engaged and do by these presents engage him\r\nto be our printer in the said French language, henceforward to print\r\nwell and duly, in good type and as correctly as may be, such books as\r\nare and shall be written in said language, and such as he may be able to\r\nrecover; and to enjoy in that office the honours, authority, privileges,\r\nprecedencies, powers, liberties, and rights which may appertain thereto,\r\nso long as it shall be our good pleasure. And in order to arouse in him\r\nthe greater ardour and to afford him better means and opportunity to\r\nmaintain and support the cost and outlays, the toil and labour which it\r\nwill be incumbent on him to make and undergo, as well in the printing and\r\ncorrecting as in other matters depending thereon, we have decreed and\r\nordered, do decree and order, and it is our pleasure that the said Janot\r\nbe given permission, by these presents, to print all books composed in the\r\nsaid French language which he may be able to recover, but only after they\r\nshall have been well, duly, and sufficiently inspected and examined, and\r\nfound to be excellent and not scandalous.... Given at Paris the twelfth\r\nday of April in the year of grace one thousand five hundred forty-three,\r\nand of our reign the twenty-ninth.\r\n\r\nOn the outside are the words: 'By the King--Present, the Bishop of\r\nThulles. Signed BAYARD; and sealed _sur double cueue_[521] with\r\nthat lord's great seal.'\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nLIST OF KING'S PRINTERS WHO PERFORMED THEIR FUNCTIONS AT PARIS, FROM\r\nTHE ORIGINAL INSTITUTION OF THAT OFFICE.\r\n\r\n    GEOFROY TORY, 1530-1533.[522]\r\n\r\n    OLIVIER MALLARD, 1536-1542.\r\n\r\n    DENIS JANOT, 1543-1550.[523]\r\n\r\n    CHARLES ESTIENNE, 1551-1561.\r\n\r\n    ROBERT ESTIENNE II (nephew of CHARLES), 1561-1570.\r\n\r\n    JEAN METTAYER, 1575-1586.\r\n\r\n    JAMET METTAYER (brother of JEAN), 1586-1602.\r\n\r\n    PIERRE METTAYER (brother of JEAN and\r\n    JAMET), 1602-1639.\r\n\r\n    MAMERT PATISSON, 1578-1601.

The office became extinct in his\r\nhands in July, 1830. M. Ambroise Firmin Didot, who thus closes the list\r\nof king's printers, opened by Tory, has another bond of union with the\r\nlatter: like him he was an engraver. See what M. Firmin Didot père wrote\r\non this subject at the beginning of his tragedy, 'Annibal,' which was\r\nprinted by him in 1817, preceded by a letter from his son, who was then\r\ntravelling in Greece; the letter being printed in an 'English' type which\r\nhe tells us was engraved by his son Ambroise.[536]\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nNOTE CONCERNING THE KING'S BINDERS AND LIBRARIANS.\r\n\r\nThere had long been functionaries known as 'libraires du roi' (king's\r\nlibrarians), when François I instituted the office of king's printer.\r\nIndeed, we find that Guillaume Eustace bore the title as early as 1574,\r\nthat is, under Louis XII. He is so styled in the subscript of an edition\r\nof 'Les Chroniques de France,' in three volumes, folio. At the end of the\r\nlast volume, we read: 'Here endeth the third and last volume of the great\r\nchronicles of France, printed at Paris in the year a thousand five hundred\r\nand fourteen, the first day of October, for Guillaume Eustace, _libraire\r\ndu Roy_, and sworn binder to the University of Paris.'\r\n\r\nIn our first edition we expressed the opinion that Eustace may have been\r\nreplaced in 1522 by Jean de Sansay, who is described as king's librarian,\r\nin 1530, in the accounts published by M. de Laborde.[537] This is an\r\nerror. Eustace was still king's librarian in 1533. Jean de Sansay was not,\r\nas Eustace was, _purveyor_ to the king's library, but _keeper_ thereof, a\r\ntitle assumed in more exact terms by one of his successors, Jean Gosselin,\r\nin a book which he caused to be printed in 1583.[538]\r\n\r\nJean de Sansay's immediate successor, under François I, seems to have been\r\nClaude Chappuis, who was king's librarian before March 28, 1543, as may be\r\nseen from the following document, dated January 6, 1544, new style, the\r\noriginal of which is in the Joursauvault collection at the Bibliothèque du\r\nLouvre:--\r\n\r\n'In the presence of me, notary and secretary of the state to the King our\r\nsire, Jehan Estienne,[539] dealer in silversmithery to the queen, having\r\npower of attorney from maistre Claude Chappuys, librarian to our said\r\nlord, thereby sufficiently authorized, did by deed of the twenty-eighth\r\nday of March a thousand five hundred forty-three, after Easter last\r\npast, executed before Jehan Langlois, royal notary in the bailiwick or\r\nchatelany of Moret, aver that he had had and received from maistre Jacques\r\nBouchetel, treasurer and paymaster of the household of our said lord,\r\nthe sum of two hundred forty livres tournois on account of his office of\r\nlibrarian during the year beginning the first day of January a thousand\r\nfive hundred forty-two [1543, n. s.], and ending the last day of December\r\na thousand five hundred forty-three.

Having become\r\nlibrarian to the King, he probably used in gilding the books mentioned in\r\nthe last quotation, the irons which François I had bought in Venice, as we\r\nlearn from another account, undated, but a little earlier, preserved, like\r\nthe others, in the national archives.\r\n\r\n'To Loys Alleman, Fleurantin, for sending to Venice for irons to\r\nprint[543] certain Italian books, and for the cost of such printing, the\r\nsum of V livres.'\r\n\r\nAs for Le Faucheux, mentioned here as a binder, he is evidently Étienne\r\nRoffet, called Le Faucheux, described as binder and librarian to the King\r\non the title-page of the 'Œuvres de Hugues Salel,' which he published, and\r\nwhich was printed at Paris, in octavo, in 1540.[544] He was the son of\r\nPierre Roffet (publisher to the two Marots, father and son), who had for\r\nhis sign a 'faucheur,' mower.[545]\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nPASSAGES WRITTEN IN LATIN, IN MOST CASES BY TORY, TRANSLATIONS OF\r\nWHICH ARE INSERTED IN THE BODY OF THE BOOK.\r\n\r\n\r\n    A\r\n\r\n    _Godofredus Torinus Bituricus Joanni Rosselletto, literarum\r\n    amantissimo, S.

Boyer has kindly made known\r\nto me, dated in 1489, informs us that this Jean Thory lived on rue aux\r\nVaches, in Faubourg Saint-Privé; so that it was on that street that\r\nGeofroy was born. 'Now,' M. Boyer writes me, 'as that street contains\r\nonly two houses, I am inclined to select as the house in question the\r\none designated by the name of _maison du perron_, because of a stoop\r\n(_perron_) with a wooden roof which is still preserved, and which is\r\naccounted for by the proximity of the river.' I saw the house in 1856; it\r\nstill belongs to the Toubeau family, which tends to confirm M. Boyer's\r\nopinion.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 502: Archives of the Department of the Cher, Series C, Notarial\r\nRecords; minutes of Jean Dujat, notary, 1507.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 503: [See supra, p. 44.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 504: On the first page of both books are the words: 'Biturigis,\r\napud Bonaventuram Thorinum, sub signo Anchoræ, vico Maiore, 1595'; and\r\nat the end: 'Excusus fuit hic liber typis viduæ Nicolai Levez, Avarici\r\nBiturigum, juxta scholas utriusque juris.' (Bibliothèque Nationale.) The\r\nfirst alone contains a license to print (dated August 29, 1595). Therein\r\nthe publisher is called, in French, 'Thorin,' the natural rendering of\r\nthe Latin name that we find in the 'note to the reader,' where the form\r\n'Torinus' occurs four times, and 'Thorinus' once only; which confirms my\r\nhypothesis relative to the descent of this bookseller of Bourges. For we\r\nhave seen that Tory wrote his name Torinus in Latin. I must not omit to\r\nmention one objection suggested by a friend of mine at Bourges,--that our\r\nman is called Bonaventure _Thorin_, in a book of imposts for the year\r\n1588. But every one knows how irregular the spelling of names was in the\r\nold days.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 505: May not Tory's son have had for his godfather Bonaventure\r\ndes Périers, who committed suicide in 1544, in order to avoid a\r\nprosecution on account of his religion?]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 506: This book, which bears a French title, _Lesclaircissement\r\nde la langue françoise_, although written in English and for the English,\r\nwas printed at London shortly after the publication of Tory's _Champ\r\nfleury_. M. Génin issued a second edition in 1852, quarto, Paris,\r\nImprimerie Nationale.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 507: Read 'Tory'; letters transposed.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 508: Read 'Bourges.' The error is due to the fact that the\r\nLondon printers were much more familiar with Bruges, where Caxton, their\r\nfirst master, lived a long while before he introduced printing in England,\r\nthan with Bourges in Berry. (See my book on the _Origin of Printing_, vol.\r\nii, pp. 347 ff.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 509: See what I have myself said on this subject, supra, p. 17.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 510: In order to be fair to everybody I am bound to say that M.\r\nGénin's reckoning is at fault. Henry VIII having succeeded to the throne\r\non April 22, 1509, the twenty-second year of his reign extends from April\r\n22, 1530, to April 21, 1531, and consequently the license cited here must\r\nhave been dated September 2, 1530, that is to say, a month and a half\r\nafter the printing of Palsgrave's book was finished.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 511: Say a year and a half, in consequence of the correction\r\nsuggested in the preceding note. However, Tory had announced a year\r\nearlier the _Reigles de lorthographe du langaige françois._ See supra, p.\r\n100.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 512: Vol. iv, fol. 320 recto.

Hence the term 'feminine' still given in French poetry to mute\r\nrhymes.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 517: In the fourth edition of the _Manuel de Libraire_; he\r\ndoes mention it in the fifth edition, however, citing me. It is not\r\nmentioned either in the _Essai sur la Vie et les Ouvrages de Marguerite\r\nd'Angoulême_, by M. de Lincy, prefixed to his edition of the _Heptameron_,\r\nwhich was published by the Société des Bibliophiles Français in 1853-54. I\r\ndescribe it from a copy owned by M. Ferdinand Denis.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 518: The original text of these letters may be found in my book,\r\n_Les Estienne et les types grecs de François Iᵉʳ_; I give here only a\r\ntranslation borrowed from M. Crapelet, _Études pratiques_, p. 89.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 519: By an inexplicable blunder M. Crapelet has thought fit\r\nto render the two words 'Gallicæ reipublicæ,' _republic (of letters)_,\r\nfailing to understand that the word 'respublica' stands for the State. It\r\nis needless to say that he has been followed by many others, particularly\r\nM. Duprat in his 'Histoire de l'Imprimerie impériale,' 1861.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 520: I borrow this fragment from M. Crapelet (_Études\r\npratiques_, p. 116), for I have been unable to inspect the volume from\r\nwhich he took it, although he gives an interesting description of it.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 521: [_Lettre à_ or _sur double queue_, letters on which the\r\nseal is suspended from a strip of parchment passed through the document.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 522: See what I have to say in the Preface on the subject of\r\nPierre le Rouge, who is given the title of king's printer once, in 1488.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 523: The dates that I give are those of the holding of the\r\noffice of _king's printer_, and not of the carrying on the trade of\r\nprinter, which, as a general rule, do not coincide, at least so far as the\r\nearlier dates are concerned.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 524: Brunet, _Manuel de Libraire_, 5th edit., vol. ii, col.\r\n1672.--See infra, p. 307 _King's Printers for the Mathematics_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 525: He calls himself 'architypographus regius' in a work\r\nprinted by him in 1608.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 526: See the _Recette générale des finances_ of Paris for 1671,\r\nin the national archives, KK. 356, fol. 53.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 527: See my _Les Estienne_, p. 35.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 528: Renouard, _Annales des Estienne_, 3d edit., p. 228, col. 1.\r\nSee also my _Les Estienne_, p. 36.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 529: This appointment involved him in some difficulty with his\r\ncolleagues, as may be seen from the following letter, of which I found a\r\ncopy in the Bibliothèque du Louvre, in the Nyon collection.\r\n\r\n'When I asked and obtained the office of king's printer, of which M. Le\r\nBreton had been deprived by death, I had no idea that it could cause\r\nany heart-burning on the part of my confrères, with whom I have always\r\nearnestly desired to be on the best of terms. If I had been able to\r\nforesee such a thing, I am too much a friend of peace to have voluntarily\r\nexposed myself to it by assuming a title which was subject to dispute.\r\nBut, monsieur, when I submitted the question to you, I thought that I\r\ncould see that it did not seem to you free from doubt. For this reason I\r\ncannot hesitate to abandon claims which seem to me well-founded.\r\n\r\n'I beg you therefore, monsieur, to regard as not having been made the\r\nclaims that I put forward on this subject, and as my confrères do not\r\npretend that any one of them has the right to style himself first king's\r\nprinter, in like manner I agree to assume simply the title of ordinary\r\nprinter to his Majesty, and that we shall be placed in the _Almanack\r\nRoyal_ in the order of our reception.\r\n\r\n    'Paris, 20 November, 1779.\r\n\r\n    PIERRES.'\r\n\r\nFor this famous printer, see Lottin, _Catalogue des Imprimeurs de Paris_,\r\nvol. ii, p. 139.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 530: For this paragraph, see my _Les Estienne_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 531: He is mentioned as 'imprimeur du roi,' without other\r\ndescription, in the registers of the cemetery of Les Réformés de la\r\nTrinité, rue Saint-Denis; but I think that he was simply an engraver on\r\ncopper, like Tavernier.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 532: [Clearly a misprint; perhaps 1561.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 533: He had been in business since 1784.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 534: He had been in business since 1813.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 535: He had been in business since 1785.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 536: There were royal printers in various cities of France after\r\nthe latter part of the sixteenth century; but the office was neither\r\nregularly instituted nor general in its scope. These printers seem to have\r\nhad it specially in charge to print official documents in the provinces,\r\nwhich function conferred on them certain privileges, and sometimes caused\r\ndifficulties with the local authorities, who also had their special\r\nprinters. The first editions of the edicts, ordinances, etc., emanating\r\nfrom the central authority were afterwards placed in the hands of the\r\nroyal printing-office in Paris. See what I have to say on this subject in\r\nmy work on _Les Estienne_, p. 56.\r\n\r\nIn 1844 M. Le Roux de Lincy published in the _Journal de l'Amateur de\r\nlivres_, and also had printed separately in an octavo pamphlet of 16\r\nleaves, a compilation entitled: _Catalogue chronologique des imprimeurs et\r\nlibraires du roi, par le père Adry_; but those shapeless memoranda were\r\nnot originally intended for printing, and I have been unable to obtain the\r\nslightest particle of useful information from them.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 537: Archives, reg.
