BURTON,\r\n\r\n  AUTHOR OF\r\n  “THE LAKE REGIONS OF CENTRAL AFRICA,” ETC.\r\n\r\n  With Illustrations.\r\n\r\n  NEW YORK:\r\n  HARPER & BROTHERS, PUBLISHERS,\r\n  FRANKLIN SQUARE.\r\n\r\n  1862.\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Clear your mind of cant.”--JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n  “MONTESINOS.--America is in more danger from religious fanaticism.\r\n  The government there not thinking it necessary to provide religious\r\n  instruction for the people in any of the new states, the prevalence\r\n  of superstition, and that, perhaps, in some wild and terrible shape,\r\n  may be looked for as one likely consequence of this great and\r\n  portentous omission. An Old Man of the Mountain might find dupes and\r\n  followers as readily as the All-friend Jemima; and the next Aaron\r\n  Burr who seeks to carve a kingdom for himself out of the overgrown\r\n  territories of the Union, may discern that fanaticism is the most\r\n  effective weapon with which ambition can arm itself; that the way\r\n  for both is prepared by that immorality which the want of religion\r\n  naturally and necessarily induces, and that camp-meetings may be\r\n  very well directed to forward the designs of military prophets. Were\r\n  there another Mohammed to arise, there is no part of the world where\r\n  he would find more scope or fairer opportunity than in that part of\r\n  the Anglo-American Union into which the older states continually\r\n  discharge the restless part of their population, leaving laws and\r\n  Gospel to overtake it if they can, for in the march of modern\r\n  colonization both are left behind.”\r\n\r\n  _This remarkable prophecy appeared from the pen of Robert Southey,\r\n  the Poet-Laureate, in March, 1829_ (“_Sir Thomas More; or, Colloquies\r\n  on the Progress and Prospects of Society_,” vol. i., Part II., “_The\r\n  Reformation--Dissenters--Methodists_.”)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Dedication.\r\n\r\n  TO\r\n  RICHARD MONCKTON MILNES.\r\n\r\n  I HAVE PREFIXED YOUR NAME, DEAR MILNES, TO “THE CITY OF THE SAINTS:”\r\n  THE NAME OF A LINGUIST, TRAVELER, POET, AND, ABOVE ALL, A MAN OF\r\n  INTELLIGENT INSIGHT INTO THE THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS OF HIS BROTHER MEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnaccustomed, of late years at least, to deal with tales of twice-told\r\ntravel, I can not but feel, especially when, as in the present case,\r\nso much detail has been expended upon the trivialities of a Diary,\r\nthe want of that freshness and originality which would have helped\r\nthe reader over a little lengthiness. My best excuse is the following\r\nextract from the lexicographer’s “Journey to the Western Islands,” made\r\nin company with Mr. Boswell during the year of grace 1773, and upheld\r\neven at that late hour as somewhat a feat in the locomotive line.\r\n\r\n“These diminutive observations seem to take away something from the\r\ndignity of writing, and therefore are never communicated but with\r\nhesitation, and a little fear of abasement and contempt. But it must be\r\nremembered that life consists not of a series of illustrious actions or\r\nelegant enjoyments; the greater part of our time passes in compliance\r\nwith necessities, in the performance of daily duties, in the removal of\r\nsmall inconveniences, in the procurement of petty pleasures, and we are\r\nwell or ill at ease as the main stream of life glides on smoothly, or\r\nis ruffled by small obstacles and frequent interruptions.”\r\n\r\nTrue! and as the novelist claims his right to elaborate, in the\r\n“domestic epic,” the most trivial scenes of household routine, so the\r\ntraveler may be allowed to enlarge, when copying nature in his humbler\r\nway, upon the subject of his little drama, and, not confining himself\r\nto the great, the good, and the beautiful, nor suffering himself\r\nto be wholly engrossed by the claims of cotton, civilization, and\r\nChristianity, useful knowledge and missionary enterprise, to _desipere\r\nin loco_ by expatiating upon his bed, his meat, and his drink.\r\n\r\nThe notes forming the ground-work of this volume were written on patent\r\nimproved metallic pocket-books in sight of the objects which attracted\r\nmy attention. The old traveler is again right when he remarks: “There\r\nis yet another cause of error not always easily surmounted, though\r\nmore dangerous to the veracity of itinerary narratives than imperfect\r\nmensuration. An observer deeply impressed by any remarkable spectacle\r\ndoes not suppose that the traces will soon vanish from his mind,\r\nand, having commonly no great convenience for writing”--Penny and\r\nLetts are of a later date--“defers the description to a time of more\r\nleisure and better accommodation. He who has not made the experiment,\r\nor is not accustomed to require rigorous accuracy from himself,\r\nwill scarcely believe how much a few hours take from certainty of\r\nknowledge and distinctness of imagery; how the succession of objects\r\nwill be broken, how separate parts will be confused, and how many\r\nparticular features and discriminations will be found compressed and\r\nconglobated with one gross and general idea.” Brave words, somewhat\r\npompous and diffused, yet worthy to be written in letters of gold. But,\r\nthough of the same opinion with M. Charles Didier, the Miso-Albion\r\n(Séjour chez le Grand-Chérif de la Mekkeh, Preface, p. vi.), when\r\nhe characterizes “un voyage de fantaisie” as “le pire de tous les\r\nromans,” and with Admiral Fitzroy (Hints to Travelers, p. 3), that\r\nthe descriptions should be written with the objects in view, I would\r\navoid the other extreme, viz., that of publishing, as our realistic\r\nage is apt to do, mere photographic representations. Byron could not\r\nwrite verse when on Lake Leman, and the traveler who puts forth his\r\nnarrative without after-study and thought will produce a kind of\r\nPersian picture, pre-Raphaelitic enough, no doubt, but lacking distance\r\nand perspective--in artists’ phrase, depth and breadth--in fact, a\r\nnarrative about as pleasing to the reader’s mind as the sage and\r\nsaleratus prairies of the Far West would be to his ken.\r\n\r\nIn working up this book I have freely used authorities well known\r\nacross the water, but more or less rare in England. The books\r\nprincipally borrowed from are “The Prairie Traveler,” by Captain\r\nMarcy; “Explorations of Nebraska,” by Lieutenant G. A. Warren; and\r\nMr. Bartlett’s “Dictionary of Americanisms.” To describe these\r\nregions without the aid of their first explorers, Messrs. Frémont and\r\nStansbury, would of course have been impossible. If I have not always\r\nspecified the authority for a statement, it has been rather for the\r\npurpose of not wearying the reader by repetitions than with the view of\r\nenriching my pages at the expense of others.\r\n\r\nIn commenting upon what was seen and heard, I have endeavored to\r\nassume--whether successfully or not the public will decide--the\r\ncosmopolitan character, and to avoid the capital error, especially\r\nin treating of things American, of looking at them from the\r\nfancied vantage-ground of an English point of view. I hold the\r\nAnglo-Scandinavian[1] of the New World to be in most things equal,\r\nin many inferior, and in many superior, to his cousin in the Old;\r\nand that a gentleman, that is to say, a man of education, probity,\r\nand honor--not, as I was once told, one who must get _on onner_\r\nand _onnest_--is every where the same, though living in separate\r\nhemispheres. If, in the present transition state of the Far West, the\r\nbroad lands lying between the Missouri River and the Sierra Nevada have\r\noccasionally been handled somewhat roughly, I have done no more than\r\nI should have permitted myself to do while treating of rambles beyond\r\nrailways through the semi-civilized parts of Great Britain, with their\r\n“pleasant primitive populations”--Wales, for instance, or Cornwall.\r\n\r\n  [1] The word is proposed by Dr. Norton Shaw, Secretary to the Royal\r\n  Geographical Society, and should be generally adopted. Anglo-Saxon is\r\n  to Anglo-Scandinavian what Indo-Germanic is to Indo-European; both\r\n  serve to humor the absurd pretensions of claimants whose principal\r\n  claim to distinction is pretentiousness. The coupling England with\r\n  Saxony suggests to my memory a toast once proposed after a patriotic\r\n  and fusional political feed in the Isle of the Knights--“Malta and\r\n  England united can conquer the world.”\r\n\r\nI need hardly say that this elaborate account of the Holy City of the\r\nWest and its denizens would not have seen the light so soon after the\r\nappearance of a “Journey to Great Salt Lake City,” by M. Jules Remy,\r\nhad there not been much left to say. The French naturalist passed\r\nthrough the Mormon Settlements in 1855, and five years in the Far West\r\nare equal to fifty in less conservative lands; the results of which\r\nare, that the relation of my experiences will in no way clash with his,\r\nor prove a tiresome repetition to the reader of both.\r\n\r\nIf in parts of this volume there appear a tendency to look upon\r\nthings generally in their ludicrous or absurd aspects--from which\r\nnothing sublunary is wholly exempt--my excuse must be _sic me natura\r\nfecit_. Democritus was not, I believe, a whit the worse philosopher\r\nthan Heraclitus. The Procreation of Mirth should be a theme far more\r\nsympathetic than the Anatomy of Melancholy, and the old Roman gentleman\r\nhad a perfect right to challenge all objectors with\r\n\r\n              ridentem dicere verum\r\n    Quid vetat?\r\n\r\nFinally, I would again solicit forbearance touching certain errors of\r\nomission and commission which are to be found in these pages. Her most\r\ngracious majesty has been pleased to honor me with an appointment as\r\nConsul at Fernando Po, in the Bight of Biafra, and the necessity of an\r\nearly departure has limited me to a single revise.\r\n\r\n  14 ST.

Mingled with the wish of prospecting the City of\r\nthe Great Salt Lake in a spiritual point of view, of seeing Utah as\r\nit is, not as it is said to be, was the mundane desire of enjoying a\r\nlittle skirmishing with the savages, who in the days of Harrison and\r\nJackson had given the pale faces tough work to do, and that failing,\r\nof inspecting the line of route which Nature, according to the general\r\nconsensus of guide-books, has pointed out as the proper, indeed the\r\nonly practical direction for a railway between the Atlantic and the\r\nPacific. The commerce of the world, the Occidental Press had assured\r\nme, is undergoing its grand climacteric: the resources of India and the\r\nnearer orient are now well-nigh cleared of “loot,” and our sons, if\r\nthey would walk in the paths of their papas, must look to Cipangri and\r\nthe parts about Cathay for _their_ annexations.\r\n\r\nThe Man was ready, the Hour hardly appeared propitious for other than\r\nbelligerent purposes. Throughout the summer of 1860 an Indian war was\r\nraging in Nebraska; the Comanches, Kiowas, and Cheyennes were “out;”\r\nthe Federal government had dispatched three columns to the centres\r\nof confusion; intestine feuds among the aborigines were talked of;\r\nthe Dakotah or Sioux had threatened to “wipe out” their old foe the\r\nPawnee, both tribes being possessors of the soil over which the road\r\nran. Horrible accounts of murdered post-boys and cannibal emigrants,\r\ngreatly exaggerated, as usual, for private and public purposes,\r\nfilled the papers, and that nothing might be wanting, the following\r\npositive assertion (I afterward found it to be, as Sir Charles Napier\r\ncharacterized one of a Bombay editor’s saying, “a marked and emphatic\r\nlie”) was copied by full half the press:\r\n\r\n“Utah has a population of some fifty-two or fifty-three thousand--more\r\nor less--rascals. Governor Cumming has informed the President exactly\r\nhow matters stand in respect to them. Neither life nor property is\r\nsafe, he says, and bands of depredators roam unpunished through the\r\nterritory. The United States judges have abandoned their offices, and\r\nthe law is boldly defied every where. He requests that 500 soldiers\r\nmay be retained at Utah to afford some kind of protection to American\r\ncitizens who are obliged to remain here.”\r\n\r\n“Mormon” had in fact become a word of fear; the Gentiles looked upon\r\nthe Latter-Day Saints much as our crusading ancestors regarded the\r\n“Hashshashiyun,” whose name, indeed, was almost enough to frighten\r\nthem. Mr. Brigham Young was the Shaykh-el-Jebel, the Old Man of\r\nthe Hill redivivus, Messrs. Kimball and Wells were the chief of\r\nhis Fidawin, and “Zion on the tops of the mountains” formed a fair\r\nrepresentation of Alamut.\r\n\r\n“Going among the Mormons!” said Mr. M---- to me at New Orleans; “they\r\nare shooting and cutting one another in all directions; how can _you_\r\nexpect to escape?”\r\n\r\nAnother general assertion was that “White Indians”--those Mormons\r\nagain!--had assisted the “Washoes,” “Pah Utes,” and “Bannacks” in the\r\nfatal affair near Honey Lake, where Major Ormsby, of the militia, a\r\nmilitary frontier-lawyer, and his forty men, lost the numbers of their\r\nmess.\r\n\r\nBut sagely thus reflecting that “dangers which loom large from afar\r\ngenerally lose size as one draws near;” that rumors of wars might\r\nhave arisen, as they are wont to do, from the political necessity\r\nfor another “Indian botheration,” as editors call it; that Governor\r\nCumming’s name might have been used in vain; that even the President\r\nmight not have been a Pope, infallible; and that the Mormons might\r\nturn out somewhat less black than they were painted; moreover, having\r\nso frequently and willfully risked the chances of an “I told you so”\r\nfrom the lips of friends, those “prophets of the past;” and, finally,\r\nhaving been so much struck with the discovery by some Western man\r\nof an enlarged truth, viz., that the bugbear approached has more\r\naffinity to the bug than to the bear, I resolved to risk the chance\r\nof the “red nightcap” from the bloodthirsty Indian and the poisoned\r\nbowie-dagger--without my Eleonora or Berengaria--from the jealous\r\nLatter-Day Saints. I forthwith applied myself to the audacious task\r\nwith all the recklessness of a “party” from town precipitating himself\r\nfor the first time into “foreign parts” about Calais.\r\n\r\nAnd, first, a few words touching routes.\r\n\r\n[THE PACIFIC RAILROAD]\r\n\r\nAs all the world knows, there are three main lines proposed for a\r\n“Pacific Railroad” between the Mississippi and the Western Ocean, the\r\nNorthern, Central, and Southern.[2]\r\n\r\n  [2] The following table shows the lengths, comparative costs, etc.,\r\n  of the several routes explored for a railroad from the Mississippi\r\n  to the Pacific, as extracted from the Speech of the Hon. Jefferson\r\n  Davis, of Mississippi, on the Pacific Railway Bill in the United\r\n  States Senate, January, 1859, and quoted by the Hon. Sylvester Maury\r\n  in the “Geography and Resources of Arizona and Sonora.”\r\n\r\n  +-----------------+------+-------+-----------+-------+--------+-------+\r\n  |                 |      |       |

of slow travel. The third,\r\nor Southern, known as the Butterfield or American Express, offered\r\nto start me in an ambulance from St. Louis, and to pass me through\r\nArkansas, El Paso, Fort Yuma on the Gila River, in fact through the\r\nvilest and most desolate portion of the West. Twenty-four mortal days\r\nand nights--twenty-five being schedule time--must be spent in that\r\nambulance; passengers becoming crazy by whisky, mixed with want of\r\nsleep, are often obliged to be strapped to their seats; their meals,\r\ndispatched during the ten-minute halts, are simply abominable, the\r\nheats are excessive, the climate malarious; lamps may not be used at\r\nnight for fear of unexisting Indians: briefly, there is no end to\r\nthis Via Mala’s miseries. The line received from the United States\r\ngovernment upward of half a million of dollars per annum for carrying\r\nthe mails, and its contract had still nearly two years to run.\r\n\r\nThere remained, therefore, the central route, which has two branches.\r\nYou may start by stage to the gold regions about Denver City or Pike’s\r\nPeak, and thence, if not accidentally or purposely shot, you may\r\nproceed by an uncertain ox-train to Great Salt Lake City, which latter\r\npart can not take less than thirty-five days. On the other hand, there\r\nis “the great emigration route” from Missouri to California and Oregon,\r\nover which so many thousands have traveled within the past few years.\r\nI quote from a useful little volume, “The Prairie Traveler,”[7] by\r\nRandolph B. Marcy, Captain U. S. Army. “The track is broad, well worn,\r\nand can not be mistaken. It has received the major part of the Mormon\r\nemigration, and was traversed by the army in its march to Utah in 1857.”\r\n\r\n  [7] Printed by Messrs. Harper & Brothers, New York, 1859, and Messrs.\r\n  Sampson Low, Son, and Co., Ludgate Hill, and amply meriting the\r\n  honors of a second edition.\r\n\r\nThe mail-coach on this line was established in 1850, by Colonel Samuel\r\nH. Woodson, an eminent lawyer, afterward an M. C., and right unpopular\r\nwith Mormondom, because he sacrilegiously owned part of Temple Block,\r\nin Independence, Mo., which is the old original New Zion. The following\r\nare the rates of contract and the phases through which the line has\r\npassed.\r\n\r\n1. Colonel Woodson received for carrying a monthly mail $19,500 (or\r\n$23,000?): length of contract 4 years.\r\n\r\n2. Mr. F. McGraw, $13,500, besides certain considerable extras.\r\n\r\n3. Messrs. Heber Kimball & Co. (Mormons), $23,000.\r\n\r\n4. Messrs. Jones & Co., $30,000.\r\n\r\n5. Mr. J. M. Hockaday, weekly mail, $190,000.\r\n\r\n6. Messrs. Russell, Majors, & Waddell, army contractors; weekly mail,\r\n$190,000.[8]\r\n\r\n  [8] In the American Almanac for 1861 (p. 196), the length of routes\r\n  in Utah Territory is 1450 miles, 533 of which have no specified mode\r\n  of transportation, and the remainder, 977, in coaches; the total\r\n  transportation is thus 170,872 miles, and the total cost $144,638.\r\n\r\n[THE UTAH LINE.]\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen that in 1856 the transit was in the hands of the\r\nLatter-Day Saints: they managed it well, but they lost the contracts\r\nduring their troubles with the federal government in 1857, when it\r\nagain fell into Gentile possession. In those early days it had but\r\nthree changes of mules, at Forts Bridger, Laramie, and Kearney.\r\nIn May, 1859, it was taken up by the present firm, which expects,\r\nby securing the monopoly of the whole line between the Missouri\r\nRiver and San Francisco, and by canvassing at head-quarters for a\r\nbi-weekly--which they have now obtained--and even a daily transit,\r\nwhich shall constitutionally extinguish the Mormon community, to insert\r\nthe fine edge of that wedge which is to open an aperture for the\r\nPacific Railroad about to be. At Saint Joseph (Mo.), better known by\r\nthe somewhat irreverent abbreviation of St. Jo, I was introduced to\r\nMr. Alexander Majors, formerly one of the contractors for supplying\r\nthe army in Utah--a veteran mountaineer, familiar with life on the\r\nprairies. His meritorious efforts to reform the morals of the land\r\nhave not yet put forth even the bud of promise. He forbade his drivers\r\nand employés to drink, gamble, curse, and travel on Sundays; he\r\ndesired them to peruse Bibles distributed to them gratis; and though\r\nhe refrained from a lengthy proclamation commanding his lieges to be\r\ngood boys and girls, he did not the less expect it of them. Results:\r\nI scarcely ever saw a sober driver; as for profanity--the Western\r\nequivalent for hard swearing--they would make the blush of shame\r\ncrimson the cheek of the old Isis bargee; and, rare exceptions to\r\nthe rule of the United States, they are not to be deterred from evil\r\ntalking even by the dread presence of a “lady.” The conductors and\r\nroad-agents are of a class superior to the drivers; they do their\r\nharm by an inordinate ambition to distinguish themselves. I met one\r\ngentleman who owned to three murders, and another individual who\r\nlately attempted to ration the mules with wild sage. The company was\r\nby no means rich; already the papers had prognosticated a failure, in\r\nconsequence of the government withdrawing its supplies, and it seemed\r\nto have hit upon the happy expedient of badly entreating travelers\r\nthat good may come to it of our evils. The hours and halting-places\r\nwere equally vilely selected; for instance, at Forts Kearney, Laramie,\r\nand Bridger, the only points where supplies, comfort, society, are\r\nprocurable, a few minutes of grumbling delay were granted as a favor,\r\nand the passengers were hurried on to some distant wretched ranch,[9]\r\napparently for the sole purpose of putting a few dollars into the\r\nstation-master’s pockets. The travel was unjustifiably slow, even in\r\nthis land, where progress is mostly on paper. From St. Jo to Great Salt\r\nLake City, the mails might easily be landed during the fine weather,\r\nwithout inconvenience to man or beast, in ten days; indeed, the agents\r\nhave offered to place them at Placerville in fifteen. Yet the schedule\r\ntime being twenty-one days, passengers seldom reached their destination\r\nbefore the nineteenth; the sole reason given was, that snow makes the\r\nroad difficult in its season, and that if people were accustomed to\r\nfast travel, and if letters were received under schedule time, they\r\nwould look upon the boon as a right.\r\n\r\n  [9] “Rancho” in Mexico means primarily a rude thatched hut where\r\n  herdsmen pass the night; the “rancharia” is a sheep-walk or\r\n  cattle-run, distinguished from a “hacienda,” which must contain\r\n  cultivation. In California it is a large farm with grounds often\r\n  measured by leagues, and it applies to any dirty hovel in the\r\n  Mississippian Valley.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to our preparations for travel, it may be as well to\r\ncast a glance at the land to be traveled over.\r\n\r\nThe United States territory lying in direct line between the\r\nMississippi River and the Pacific Ocean is now about 1200 miles long\r\nfrom north to south, by 1500 of breadth, in 49° and 32° N. lat.,\r\nabout equal to Equatorial Africa, and 1800 in N. lat. 38°. The great\r\nuncultivable belt of plain and mountain region through which the\r\nPacific Railroad must run has a width of 1100 statute miles near the\r\nnorthern boundary; in the central line, 1200; and through the southern,\r\n1000. Humboldt justly ridiculed the “maddest natural philosopher”\r\nwho compared the American continent to a female figure--long, thin,\r\nwatery, and freezing at the 58th°, the degrees being symbolic of the\r\nyear at which woman grows old. Such description manifestly will not\r\napply to the 2,000,000 of square miles in this section of the Great\r\nRepublic--she is every where broader than she is long.\r\n\r\nThe meridian of 105° north longitude (G.)--Fort Laramie lies in 104°\r\n31′ 26″--divides this vast expanse into two nearly equal parts. The\r\neastern half is a basin or river valley rising gradually from the\r\nMississippi to the Black Hills, and the other outlying ranges of the\r\nRocky Mountains. The average elevation near the northern boundary\r\n(49°) is 2500 feet, in the middle latitude (38°) 6000 feet, and near\r\nthe southern extremity (32°), about 4000 feet above sea level. These\r\nfigures explain the complicated features of its water-shed. The western\r\nhalf is a mountain region whose chains extend, as far as they are\r\nknown, in a general N. and S. direction.\r\n\r\nThe 99th meridian (G.)--Fort Kearney lies in 98° 58′ 11″--divides the\r\nwestern half of the Mississippian Valley into two unequal parts.\r\n\r\nThe eastern portion, from the Missouri to Fort Kearney--400 to 500\r\nmiles in breadth--may be called the “Prairie land.” It is true that\r\npassing westward of the 97° meridian, the _mauvaises terres_, or Bad\r\nGrounds, are here and there met with, especially near the 42d parallel,\r\nin which latitude they extend farther to the east, and that upward to\r\n99° the land is rarely fit for cultivation, though fair for grazing.\r\nYet along the course of the frequent streams there is valuable soil,\r\nand often sufficient wood to support settlements. This territory is\r\nstill possessed by settled Indians, by semi-nomads, and by powerful\r\ntribes of equestrian and wandering savages, mixed with a few white men,\r\nwho, as might be expected, excel them in cunning and ferocity.\r\n\r\n[THE WESTERN GRAZING-GROUNDS.]\r\n\r\nThe western portion of the valley, from Fort Kearney to the base of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains--a breadth of 300 to 400 miles--is emphatically\r\n“the desert,” sterile and uncultivable, a dreary expanse of wild sage\r\n(artemisia) and saleratus. The surface is sandy, gravelly, and pebbly;\r\ncactus carduus and aloes abound; grass is found only in the rare river\r\nbottoms where the soils of the different strata are mixed, and the\r\nfew trees along the borders of streams--fertile lines of wadis, which\r\nlaborious irrigation and coal mining might convert into oases--are\r\nthe cotton-wood and willow, to which the mezquite[10] may be added in\r\nthe southern latitudes. The desert is mostly uninhabited, unendurable\r\neven to the wildest Indian. But the people on its eastern and western\r\nfrontiers, namely, those holding the extreme limits of the fertile\r\nprairie, and those occupying the desirable regions of the western\r\nmountains, are, to quote the words of Lieutenant Gouverneur K. Warren,\r\nU. S. Topographical Engineers, whose valuable reconnaissances and\r\nexplanations of Nebraska in 1855, ’56, and ’57 were published in the\r\nReports of the Secretary of War, “on the shore of a sea, up to which\r\npopulation and agriculture may advance and no farther. But this gives\r\nthese outposts much of the value of places along the Atlantic frontier,\r\nin view of the future settlements to be formed in the mountains,\r\nbetween which and the present frontier a most valuable trade would\r\nexist. The western frontier has always been looking to the east for\r\na market; but as soon as the wave of emigration has passed over the\r\ndesert portion of the plains, to which the discoveries of gold have\r\nalready given an impetus that will propel it to the fertile valleys\r\nof the Rocky Mountains, then will the present frontier of Kansas\r\nand Nebraska become the starting-point for all the products of the\r\nMississippi Valley which the population of the mountains will require.\r\nWe see the effects of it in the benefits which the western frontier of\r\nMissouri has received from the Santa Fé tract, and still more plainly\r\nin the impetus given to Leavenworth by the operations of the army of\r\nUtah in the interior region. This flow of products has, in the last\r\ninstance, been only in one direction; but when those mountains become\r\nsettled, as they eventually must, then there will be a reciprocal trade\r\nmaterially beneficial to both.”\r\n\r\n  [10] Often corrupted from the Spanish to muskeet (_Algarobia\r\n  glandulosa_), a locust inhabiting Texas, New Mexico, California,\r\n  etc., bearing, like the carob generally, a long pod full of sweet\r\n  beans, which, pounded and mixed with flour, are a favorite food with\r\n  the Southwestern Indians.\r\n\r\nThe mountain region westward of the sage and saleratus desert,\r\nextending between the 105th and 111th meridian (G.)--a little more\r\nthan 400 miles--will in time become sparsely peopled. Though in many\r\nparts arid and sterile, dreary and desolate, the long bunch grass\r\n(_Festuca_), the short curly buffalo grass (_Sisleria dactyloides_),\r\nthe mesquit grass (_Stipa spata_), and the Gramma, or rather, as it\r\nshould be called, “Gamma” grass (_Chondrosium fœnum_),[11] which clothe\r\nthe slopes west of Fort Laramie, will enable it to rear an abundance of\r\nstock. The fertile valleys, according to Lieutenant Warren, “furnish\r\nthe means of raising sufficient quantities of grain and vegetables\r\nfor the use of the inhabitants, and beautiful healthy and desirable\r\nlocations for their homes. The remarkable freedom here from sickness is\r\none of the attractive features of the region, and will in this respect\r\ngo far to compensate the settler from the Mississippi Valley for his\r\nloss in the smaller amount of products that can be taken from the soil.\r\nThe great want of suitable building material, which now so seriously\r\nretards the growth of the West, will not be felt there.” The heights\r\nof the Rocky Mountains rise abruptly from 1000 to 6000 feet over the\r\nlowest known passes, computed by the Pacific Railroad surveyors to vary\r\nfrom 4000 to 10,000 feet above sea-level. The two chains forming the\r\neastern and western rims of the Rocky Mountain basin have the greatest\r\nelevation, walling in, as it were, the other sub-ranges.\r\n\r\n  [11] Some of my informants derived the word from the Greek letter;\r\n  others make it Hispano-Mexican.\r\n\r\nThere is a popular idea that the western slope of the Rocky Mountains\r\nis smooth and regular; on the contrary, the land is rougher, and the\r\nground is more complicated than on the eastern declivities. From the\r\nsummit of the Wasach range to the eastern foot of the Sierra Nevada,\r\nthe whole region, with exceptions, is a howling wilderness, the sole\r\nor bed of an inland sweetwater sea, now shrunk into its remnants--the\r\nGreat Salt and the Utah Lakes. Nothing can be more monotonous than its\r\nregular succession of high grisly hills, cut perpendicularly by rough\r\nand rocky ravines, and separating bare and barren plains. From the\r\nseaward base of the Sierra Nevada to the Pacific--California--the slope\r\nis easy, and the land is pleasant, fertile, and populous.\r\n\r\nAfter this _aperçu_ of the motives which sent me forth, once more a\r\npilgrim, to young Meccah in the West, of the various routes, and of\r\nthe style of country wandered over, I plunge at once into personal\r\nnarrative.\r\n\r\n[KIT.]\r\n\r\nLieutenant Dana (U. S. Artillery), my future _compagnon de voyage_,\r\nleft St. Louis,[12] “the turning-back place of English sportsmen,” for\r\nSt. Jo on the 2d of August, preceding me by two days. Being accompanied\r\nby his wife and child, and bound on a weary voyage to Camp Floyd, Utah\r\nTerritory, he naturally wanted a certain amount of precise information\r\nconcerning the route, and one of the peculiarities of this line is that\r\nno one knows any thing about it. In the same railway car which carried\r\nme from St. Louis were five passengers, all bent upon making Utah with\r\nthe least delay--an unexpected cargo of officials: Mr. F********,\r\na federal judge with two sons; Mr. W*****, a state secretary; and\r\nMr. G****, a state marshal. As the sequel may show, Dana was doubly\r\nfortunate in securing places before the list could be filled up by the\r\nunusual throng: all we thought of at the time was our good luck in\r\nescaping a septidium at St. Jo, whence the stage started on Tuesdays\r\nonly. We hurried, therefore, to pay for our tickets--$175 each being\r\nthe moderate sum--to reduce our luggage to its minimum approach toward\r\n25 lbs., the price of transport for excess being exorbitantly fixed at\r\n$1 per lb., and to lay in a few necessaries for the way, tea and sugar,\r\ntobacco and cognac. I will not take liberties with my company’s “kit;”\r\nmy own, however, was represented as follows:\r\n\r\n  [12] St. Louis (Mo.) lies in N. lat. 28° 37′ and W. long. (G.) 90°\r\n  16′: its elevation above tide water is 461 feet: the latest frost\r\n  is in the first week of March, the earliest is in the middle of\r\n  November, giving some 115 days of cold. St. Joseph (Mo.) lies about\r\n  N. lat. 39° 40′, and W. long. (G.) 34° 54′.\r\n\r\nOne India-rubber blanket, pierced in the centre for a poncho, and\r\ngarnished along the longer side with buttons, and corresponding elastic\r\nloops with a strap at the short end, converting it into a carpet-bag--a\r\n“sine quâ non” from the equator to the pole. A buffalo robe ought to\r\nhave been added as a bed: ignorance, however, prevented, and borrowing\r\ndid the rest. With one’s coat as a pillow, a robe, and a blanket, one\r\nmay defy the dangerous “bunks” of the stations.\r\n\r\nFor weapons I carried two revolvers: from the moment of leaving St. Jo\r\nto the time of reaching Placerville or Sacramento the pistol should\r\nnever be absent from a man’s right side--remember, it is handier there\r\nthan on the other--nor the bowie-knife from his left. Contingencies\r\nwith Indians and others may happen, when the difference of a second\r\nsaves life: the revolver should therefore be carried with its butt\r\nto the fore, and when drawn it should not be leveled as in target\r\npractice, but directed toward the object by means of the right fore\r\nfinger laid flat along the cylinder while the medius draws the trigger.\r\nThe instinctive consent between eye and hand, combined with a little\r\npractice, will soon enable the beginner to shoot correctly from the\r\nhip; all he has to do is to think that he is pointing at the mark, and\r\npull. As a precaution, especially when mounted upon a kicking horse,\r\nit is wise to place the cock upon a capless nipple, rather than trust\r\nto the intermediate pins. In dangerous places the revolver should be\r\ndischarged and reloaded every morning, both for the purpose of keeping\r\nthe hand in, and to do the weapon justice. A revolver is an admirable\r\ntool when properly used; those, however, who are too idle or careless\r\nto attend to it, had better carry a pair of “Derringers.” For the\r\nbenefit of buffalo and antelope, I had invested $25 at St. Louis in a\r\n“shooting-iron” of the “Hawkins” style--that enterprising individual\r\nnow dwells in Denver City--it was a long, top-heavy rifle; it weighed\r\n12 lbs., and it carried the smallest ball--75 to the pound--a\r\ncombination highly conducive to good practice. Those, however, who can\r\nuse light weapons, should prefer the Maynard breech-loader, with an\r\nextra barrel for small shot; and if Indian fighting is in prospect,\r\nthe best tool, without any exception, is a ponderous double-barrel, 12\r\nto the pound, and loaded as fully as it can bear with slugs. The last\r\nof the battery was an air-gun to astonish the natives, and a bag of\r\nvarious ammunition.\r\n\r\nCaptain Marcy outfits his prairie traveler with a “little blue mass,\r\nquinine, opium, and some cathartic medicine put up in doses for\r\nadults.” I limited myself to the opium, which is invaluable when one\r\nexpects five consecutive days and nights in a prairie wagon, quinine,\r\nand Warburg’s drops, without which no traveler should ever face fever,\r\nand a little citric acid, which, with green tea drawn off the moment\r\nthe leaf has sunk, is perhaps the best substitute for milk and cream.\r\nThe “holy weed Nicotian” was not forgotten; cigars must be bought in\r\nextraordinary quantities, as the driver either receives or takes the\r\nlion’s share: the most satisfactory outfit is a _quantum sufficit_\r\nof Louisiana Pirique and Lynchburg gold-leaf--cavendish without its\r\nabominations of rum and honey or molasses--and two pipes, a meerschaum\r\nfor luxury, and a brier-root to fall back upon when the meerschaum\r\nshall have been stolen. The Indians will certainly pester for matches;\r\nthe best lighting apparatus, therefore, is the Spanish mechero, the\r\nOriental sukhtah--agate and cotton match--besides which, it offers a\r\npleasing exercise, like billiards, and one at which the British soldier\r\ngreatly excels, surpassed only by his exquisite skill in stuffing the\r\npipe.\r\n\r\nFor literary purposes, I had, besides the two books above quoted,\r\na few of the great guns of exploration, Frémont, Stansbury, and\r\nGunnison, with a selection of the most violent Mormon and Anti-Mormon\r\npolemicals, sketching materials--I prefer the “improved metallics”\r\nfive inches long, and serving for both diary and drawing-book--and a\r\ntourist’s writing-case of those sold by Mr. Field (Bible Warehouse,\r\nThe Quadrant), with but one alteration, a snap lock, to obviate the\r\nuse of that barbarous invention called a key. For instruments I\r\ncarried a pocket sextant with a double face, invented by Mr. George,\r\nof the Royal Geographical Society, and beautifully made by Messrs.\r\nCary, an artificial horizon of black glass, and bubble tubes to\r\nlevel it, night and day compasses, with a portable affair attached\r\nto a watch-chain--a traveler feels nervous till he can “orienter”\r\nhimself--a pocket thermometer, and a B. P. ditto. The only safe form\r\nfor the latter would be a strong neckless tube, the heavy pyriform\r\nbulbs in general use never failing to break at the first opportunity.\r\nA Stanhope lens, a railway whistle, and instead of the binocular,\r\nuseful things of earth, a very valueless telescope--(warranted by the\r\nmaker to show Jupiter’s satellites, and by utterly declining so to\r\ndo, reading a lesson touching the non-advisability of believing an\r\ninstrument-maker)--completed the outfit.\r\n\r\n[TOILET.]\r\n\r\nThe prairie traveler is not particular about toilet: the easiest dress\r\nis a dark flannel shirt, worn over the normal article; no braces--I say\r\nit, despite Mr. Galton--but broad leather belt for “six-shooter” and\r\nfor “Arkansas tooth-pick,” a long clasp-knife, or for the rapier of the\r\nWestern world, called after the hero who perished in the “red butchery\r\nof the Alamo.” The nether garments should be forked with good buckskin,\r\nor they will infallibly give out, and the lower end should be tucked\r\ninto the boots, after the sensible fashion of our grandfathers, before\r\nthose ridiculous Wellingtons were dreamed of by our sires. In warm\r\nweather, a pair of moccasins will be found easy as slippers, but they\r\nare bad for wet places; they make the feet tender, they strain the back\r\nsinews, and they form the first symptom of the savage mania. Socks keep\r\nthe feet cold; there are, however, those who should take six pair. The\r\nuse of the pocket-handkerchief is unknown in the plains; some people,\r\nhowever, are uncomfortable without it, not liking “se emungere” after\r\nthe fashion of Horace’s father.\r\n\r\nIn cold weather--and rarely are the nights warm--there is nothing\r\nbetter than the old English tweed shooting-jacket, made with pockets\r\nlike a poacher’s, and its similar waistcoat, a “stomach warmer” without\r\na roll collar, which prevents comfortable sleep, and with flaps as in\r\nthe Year of Grace 1760, when men were too wise to wear our senseless\r\nvests, whose only property seems to be that of disclosing after\r\nexertions a lucid interval of linen or longcloth. For driving and\r\nriding, a large pair of buckskin gloves, or rather gauntlets, without\r\nwhich even the teamster will not travel, and leggins--the best are\r\nmade in the country, only the straps should be passed through and sewn\r\non to the leathers--are advisable, if at least the man at all regards\r\nhis epidermis: it is almost unnecessary to bid you remember spurs,\r\nbut it may be useful to warn you that they will, like riches, make to\r\nthemselves wings. The head-covering by excellence is a brown felt,\r\nwhich, by a little ingenuity, boring, for instance, holes round the\r\nbrim to admit a ribbon, you may convert into a riding-hat or night-cap,\r\nand wear alternately after the manly slouch of Cromwell and his Martyr,\r\nthe funny three-cornered spittoon-like “shovel” of the Dutch Georges,\r\nand the ignoble cocked-hat, which completes the hideous metamorphosis.\r\n\r\nAnd, above all things, as you value your nationality--this is written\r\nfor the benefit of the home reader--let no false shame cause you\r\nto forget your hat-box and your umbrella. I purpose, when a moment\r\nof inspiration waits upon leisure and a mind at ease, to invent an\r\nelongated portmanteau, which shall be perfection--portable--solid\r\nleather of two colors, for easy distinguishment--snap lock--in length\r\nabout three feet; in fact, long enough to contain without creasing\r\n“small clothes,” a lateral compartment destined for a hat, and a\r\nlongitudinal space where the umbrella can repose: its depth--but I must\r\nreserve that part of the secret until this benefit to British humanity\r\nshall have been duly made by Messrs. Bengough Brothers, and patented by\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nThe dignitaries of the mail-coach, acting upon the principle “first\r\ncome first served,” at first decided, maugre all our attempts at “moral\r\nsuasion,” to divide the party by the interval of a week. Presently\r\nreflecting, I presume, upon the unadvisability of leaving at large five\r\ngentlemen, who, being really in no particular hurry, might purchase\r\na private conveyance and start leisurely westward, they were favored\r\nwith a revelation of “’cuteness.” On the day before departure, as,\r\ncongregated in the Planter’s House Hotel, we were lamenting over our\r\n“morning glory,” the necessity of parting--in the prairie the more\r\nthe merrier, and the fewer the worse cheer--a youth from the office\r\nwas introduced to tell, Hope-like, a flattering tale and a tremendous\r\nfalsehood. This juvenile delinquent stated with unblushing front,\r\nover the hospitable cocktail, that three coaches instead of one had\r\nbeen newly and urgently applied for by the road-agent at Great Salt\r\nLake City, and therefore that we could not only all travel together,\r\nbut also all travel with the greatest comfort. We exulted. But on the\r\nmorrow only two conveyances appeared, and not long afterward the two\r\ndwindled off to one. “The Prairie Traveler” doles out wisdom in these\r\nwords: “Information concerning the route coming from strangers living\r\nor owning property near them, from agents of steam-boats and railways,\r\nor from other persons connected with transportation companies”--how\r\ncarefully he piles up the heap of sorites--“should be received\r\nwith great caution, and never without corroboratory evidence from\r\ndisinterested sources.” The main difficulty is to find the latter--to\r\ncatch your hare--to know whom to believe.\r\n\r\nI now proceed to my Diary.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE START.\r\n\r\n  _Tuesday, 7th August, 1860._\r\n\r\nPrecisely at 8 A.M. appeared in front of the Patee House--the Fifth\r\nAvenue Hotel of St. Jo--the vehicle destined to be our home for the\r\nnext three weeks. We scrutinized it curiously.\r\n\r\n[MAIL-COACH.--MULES.]\r\n\r\nThe mail is carried by a “Concord coach,” a spring wagon, comparing\r\nadvantageously with the horrible vans which once dislocated the joints\r\nof men on the Suez route. The body is shaped somewhat like an English\r\ntax-cart considerably magnified. It is built to combine safety,\r\nstrength, and lightness, without the slightest regard to appearances.\r\nThe material is well-seasoned white oak--the Western regions, and\r\nespecially Utah, are notoriously deficient in hard woods--and the\r\nmanufacturers are the well-known coachwrights, Messrs. Abbott, of\r\nConcord, New Hampshire; the color is sometimes green, more usually red,\r\ncausing the antelopes to stand and stretch their large eyes whenever\r\nthe vehicle comes in sight. The wheels are five to six feet apart,\r\naffording security against capsising, with little “gather” and less\r\n“dish;” the larger have fourteen spokes and seven fellies; the smaller\r\ntwelve and six. The tires are of unusual thickness, and polished like\r\nsteel by the hard dry ground; and the hubs or naves and the metal\r\nnave-bands are in massive proportions. The latter not unfrequently\r\nfall off as the wood shrinks, unless the wheel is allowed to stand in\r\nwater; attention must be paid to resetting them, or in the frequent\r\nand heavy “sidlins” the spokes may snap off all round like pipe-stems.\r\nThe wagon-bed is supported by iron bands or perpendiculars abutting\r\nupon wooden rockers, which rest on strong leather thoroughbraces:\r\nthese are found to break the jolt better than the best steel springs,\r\nwhich, moreover, when injured, can not readily be repaired. The whole\r\nbed is covered with stout osnaburg supported by stiff bars of white\r\noak; there is a sun-shade or hood in front, where the driver sits, a\r\ncurtain behind which can be raised or lowered at discretion, and four\r\nflaps on each side, either folded up or fastened down with hooks and\r\neyes. In heavy frost the passengers must be half dead with cold, but\r\nthey care little for that if they can go fast. The accommodations\r\nare as follows: In front sits the driver, with usually a conductor\r\nor passenger by his side; a variety of packages, large and small, is\r\nstowed away under his leather cushion; when the brake must be put on,\r\nan operation often involving the safety of the vehicle, his right foot\r\nis planted upon an iron bar which presses by a leverage upon the rear\r\nwheels; and in hot weather a bucket for watering the animals hangs\r\nover one of the lamps, whose companion is usually found wanting. The\r\ninside has either two or three benches fronting to the fore or placed\r\n_vis-à-vis_; they are movable and reversible, with leather cushions\r\nand hinged padded backs; unstrapped and turned down, they convert\r\nthe vehicle into a tolerable bed for two persons or two and a half.\r\nAccording to Cocker, the mail-bags should be safely stowed away under\r\nthese seats, or if there be not room enough, the passengers should\r\nperch themselves upon the correspondence; the jolly driver, however, is\r\nusually induced to cram the light literature between the wagon-bed and\r\nthe platform, or running-gear beneath, and thus, when ford-waters wash\r\nthe hubs, the letters are pretty certain to endure ablution. Behind,\r\ninstead of dicky, is a kind of boot where passengers’ boxes are stored\r\nbeneath a stout canvas curtain with leather sides. The comfort of\r\ntravel depends upon packing the wagon; if heavy in front or rear, or if\r\nthe thoroughbraces be not properly “fixed,” the bumping will be likely\r\nto cause nasal hemorrhage. The description will apply to the private\r\nambulance, or, as it is called in the West, “avalanche,” only the\r\nlatter, as might be expected, is more convenient; it is the drosky in\r\nwhich the vast steppes of Central America are crossed by the government\r\nemployés.\r\n\r\nOn this line mules are preferred to horses as being more enduring.\r\nThey are all of legitimate race; the breed between the horse and the\r\nshe-ass is never heard of, and the mysterious jumard is not believed\r\nto exist. In dry lands, where winter is not severe--they inherit the\r\nsire’s impatience of cold--they are invaluable animals; in swampy\r\nground this American dromedary is the meanest of beasts, requiring,\r\nwhen stalled, to be hauled out of the mire before it will recover\r\nspirit to use its legs. For sureness of foot (during a journey of more\r\nthan 1000 miles, I saw but one fall and two severe stumbles), sagacity\r\nin finding the road, apprehension of danger, and general cleverness,\r\nmules are superior to their mothers: their main defect is an unhappy\r\nobstinacy derived from the other side of the house. They are great in\r\nhardihood, never sick nor sorry, never groomed nor shod, even where ice\r\nis on the ground; they have no grain, except five quarts per diem when\r\nsnow conceals the grass; and they have no stable save the open corral.\r\nMoreover, a horse once broken down requires a long rest; the mule, if\r\nhitched up or ridden for short distances, with frequent intervals to\r\nroll and repose, may still, though “_resté_,” get over 300 miles in\r\ntolerable time. The rate of travel on an average is five miles an hour;\r\nsix is good; between seven and eight is the maximum, which sinks in\r\nhilly countries to three or four. I have made behind a good pair, in\r\na light wagon, forty consecutive miles at the rate of nine per hour,\r\nand in California a mule is little thought of if it can not accomplish\r\n250 miles in forty-eight hours. The price varies from $100 to $130 per\r\nhead when cheap, rising to $150 or $200, and for fancy animals from\r\n$250 to $400. The value, as in the case of the Arab, depends upon size;\r\n“rats,” or small mules, especially in California, are not esteemed.\r\nThe “span”--the word used in America for beasts well matched--is of\r\ncourse much more expensive. At each station on this road, averaging\r\ntwenty-five miles apart--beyond the forks of the Platte they lengthen\r\nout by one third--are three teams of four animals, with two extra,\r\nmaking a total of fourteen, besides two ponies for the express riders.\r\nIn the East they work beautifully together, and are rarely mulish\r\nbeyond a certain ticklishness of temper, which warns you not to meddle\r\nwith their ears when in harness, or to attempt encouraging them by\r\npreceding them upon the road. In the West, where they run half wild\r\nand are lassoed for use once a week, they are fearfully handy with\r\ntheir heels; they flirt out with the hind legs, they rear like goats,\r\nbreaking the harness and casting every strap and buckle clean off\r\nthe body, and they bite their replies to the chorus of curses and\r\nblows: the wonder is that more men are not killed. Each fresh team\r\nmust be ringed half a dozen times before it will start fairly; there\r\nis always some excitement in change; some George or Harry, some Julia\r\nor Sally disposed to shirk work or to play tricks, some Brigham Young\r\nor General Harney--the Trans-Vaal Republican calls his worst animal\r\n“England”--whose stubbornness is to be corrected by stone-throwing or\r\nthe lash.\r\n\r\nBut the wagon still stands at the door. We ought to start at 8 30\r\nA.M.; we are detained an hour while last words are said, and adieu--a\r\nlong adieu--is bidden to joke and julep, to ice and idleness. Our\r\n“plunder”[13] is clapped on with little ceremony; a hat-case falls\r\nopen--it was not mine, gentle reader--collars and other small gear\r\ncumber the ground, and the owner addresses to the clumsy-handed driver\r\nthe universal G-- d--, which in these lands changes from its expletive\r\nor chrysalis form to an adjectival development. We try to stow away as\r\nmuch as possible; the minor officials, with all their little faults,\r\nare good fellows, civil and obliging; they wink at non-payment for\r\nbedding, stores, weapons, and they rather encourage than otherwise the\r\nmultiplication of whisky-kegs and cigar-boxes. We now drive through the\r\ndusty roads of St. Jo, the observed of all observers, and presently\r\nfind ourselves in the steam ferry which is to convey us from the right\r\nto the left bank of the Missouri River. The “Big Muddy,” as it is now\r\ncalled--the Yellow River of old writers--venerable sire of snag and\r\nsawyer, displays at this point the source whence it has drawn for ages\r\nthe dirty brown silt which pollutes below their junction the pellucid\r\nwaters of the “Big Drink.”[14] It runs, like the lower Indus, through\r\ndeep walls of stiff clayey earth, and, like that river, its supplies,\r\nwhen filtered (they have been calculated to contain one eighth of solid\r\nmatter), are sweet and wholesome as its brother streams. The Plata of\r\nthis region, it is the great sewer of the prairies, the main channel\r\nand common issue of the water-courses and ravines which have carried\r\non the work of denudation and degradation for days dating beyond the\r\nexistence of Egypt.\r\n\r\n  [13] In Canada they call personal luggage _butin_.\r\n\r\n  [14] A “Drink” is any river: the Big Drink is the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n[THE MISSOURI RIVER]\r\n\r\nAccording to Lieutenant Warren, who endorses the careful examinations\r\nof the parties under Governor Stevens in 1853, the Missouri is a\r\nsuperior river for navigation to any in the country, except the\r\nMississippi below their junction. It has, however, serious obstacles\r\nin wind and frost. From the Yellow Stone to its mouth, the breadth,\r\nwhen full, varies from one third to half a mile; in low water the\r\nwidth shrinks, and bars appear. Where timber does not break the force\r\nof the winds, which are most violent in October, clouds of sand are\r\nseen for miles, forming banks, which, generally situated at the edges\r\nof trees on the islands and points, often so much resemble the Indian\r\nmounds in the Mississippi Valley, that some of them--for instance,\r\nthose described by Lewis and Clarke at Bonhomme Island--have been\r\nfigured as the works of the ancient Toltecs. It would hardly be\r\nfeasible to correct the windage by foresting the land. The bluffs\r\nof the Missouri are often clothed with vegetation as far as the\r\ndebouchure of the Platte River. Above that point the timber, which is\r\nchiefly cotton-wood, is confined to ravines and bottom lands, varying\r\nin width from ten to fifteen miles above Council Bluffs, which is\r\nalmost continuous to the mouth of the James River. Every where, except\r\nbetween the mouth of the Little Cheyenne and the Cannon Ball rivers,\r\nthere is a sufficiency of fuel for navigation; but, ascending above\r\nCouncil Bluffs, the protection afforded by forest growth on the banks\r\nis constantly diminishing. The trees also are injurious; imbedded in\r\nthe channel by the “caving-in” of the banks, they form the well-known\r\nsawyers, or floating timbers, and snags, trunks standing like _chevaux\r\nde frise_ at various inclinations, pointing down the stream. From the\r\nmouth of the James River down to the Mississippi, it is a wonder how a\r\nsteamer can run: she must lose half her time by laying to at night, and\r\nis often delayed for days, as the wind prevents her passing by bends\r\nfilled with obstructions. The navigation is generally closed by ice\r\nat Sioux City on the 10th of November, and at Fort Leavenworth by the\r\n1st of December. The rainy season of the spring and summer commences\r\nin the latitude of Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, and Southern Nebraska,\r\nbetween the 15th of May and the 30th of June, and continues about two\r\nmonths. The floods produced by the melting snows in the mountains come\r\nfrom the Platte, the Big Cheyenne, the Yellow Stone, and the Upper\r\nMissouri, reaching the lower river about the 1st of July, and lasting\r\na month. Rivers like this, whose navigation depends upon temporary\r\nfloods, are greatly inferior for ascent than for descent. The length of\r\nthe inundation much depends upon the snow on the mountains: a steamer\r\nstarting from St.Louis on the first indication of the rise would not\r\ngenerally reach the Yellow Stone before low water at the latter point,\r\nand if a miscalculation is made by taking the temporary rise for the\r\nreal inundation, the boat must lay by in the middle of the river till\r\nthe water deepens.\r\n\r\nSome geographers have proposed to transfer to the Missouri, on\r\naccount of its superior length, the honor of being the real head of\r\nthe Mississippi; they neglect, however, to consider the direction\r\nand the course of the stream, an element which must enter largely in\r\ndetermining the channels of great rivers. It will, I hope, be long\r\nbefore this great ditch wins the day from the glorious Father of Waters.\r\n\r\nThe reader will find in Appendix No. I. a detailed itinerary, showing\r\nhim the distances between camping-places, the several mail stations\r\nwhere mules are changed, the hours of travel, and the facilities for\r\nobtaining wood and water--in fact, all things required for the novice,\r\nhunter, or emigrant. In these pages I shall consider the route rather\r\nin its pictorial than in its geographical aspects, and give less of\r\ndiary than of dissertation upon the subjects which each day’s route\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\n[THE PRAIRIE.]\r\n\r\nLanding in Bleeding Kansas--she still bleeds[15]--we fell at once\r\ninto “Emigration Road,” a great thoroughfare, broad and well worn as\r\na European turnpike or a Roman military route, and undoubtedly the\r\nbest and the longest natural highway in the world. For five miles the\r\nline bisected a bottom formed by a bend in the river, with about a\r\nmile’s diameter at the neck. The scene was of a luxuriant vegetation.\r\nA deep tangled wood--rather a thicket or a jungle than a forest--of\r\noaks and elms, hickory, basswood[16] and black walnut, poplar and\r\nhackberry (_Celtis crassifolia_), box elder, and the common willow\r\n(_Salix longifolia_), clad and festooned, bound and anchored by wild\r\nvines, creepers, and huge llianas, and sheltering an undergrowth of\r\nwhite alder and red sumach, whose pyramidal flowers were about to\r\nfall, rested upon a basis of deep black mire, strongly suggestive\r\nof chills--fever and ague. After an hour of burning sun and sickly\r\ndamp, the effects of the late storms, we emerged from the waste of\r\nvegetation, passed through a straggling “neck o’ the woods,” whose\r\nyellow inmates reminded me of Mississippian descriptions in the days\r\ngone by, and after spanning some very rough ground we bade adieu to\r\nthe valley of the Missouri, and emerged upon the region of the Grand\r\nPrairie,[17] which we will pronounce “perrairey.”\r\n\r\n  [15] And no wonder!\r\n\r\n  “I advise you, one and all, to enter every election district in\r\n  Kansas and vote at the point of the bowie-knife and revolver. Neither\r\n  give nor take quarter, as our case demands it.”\r\n\r\n  “I tell you, mark every scoundrel among you that is the least tainted\r\n  with Free-soilism or Abolitionism, and exterminate him. Neither give\r\n  nor take quarter from them.”\r\n\r\n  (Extracts from Speeches of General Stringfellow--happy name!--in the\r\n  Kansas Legislature.)\r\n\r\n  [16] The basswood (_Tilia Americana_) resembles our linden: the\r\n  trivial name is derived from “bast,” its inner bark being used for\r\n  mats and cordage. From the pliability of the bark and wood, the name\r\n  of the tree is made synonymous with “doughface” in the following\r\n  extract from one of Mr. Brigham Young’s sermons: “I say, as the Lord\r\n  lives, we are bound to become a sovereign state in the Union, or an\r\n  independent nation by ourselves; and let them drive us from this\r\n  place if they can--they can not do it. I do not throw this out as a\r\n  banter. You Gentiles, and hickory and _basswood_ Mormons, can write\r\n  it down, if you please; but write it as I speak it.” The above has\r\n  been extracted from a “Dictionary of Americanisms,” by John Russell\r\n  Bartlett (London, Trübner and Co., 1859), a glossary which the\r\n  author’s art has made amusing as a novel.\r\n\r\n  [17] The word is somewhat indefinite. Hunters apply it generally\r\n  to the bare lands lying westward of the timbered course of the\r\n  Mississippi; in fact, to the whole region from the southern Rio\r\n  Grande to the Great Slave Lake.\r\n\r\nDiffering from the card-table surfaces of the formation in Illinois and\r\nthe lands east of the Mississippi, the Western prairies are rarely flat\r\nground. Their elevation above sea-level varies from 1000 to 2500 feet,\r\nand the plateau’s aspect impresses the eye with an exaggerated idea\r\nof elevation, there being no object of comparison--mountain, hill, or\r\nsometimes even a tree--to give a juster measure. Another peculiarity\r\nof the prairie is, in places, its seeming horizontality, whereas it is\r\nnever level: on an open plain, apparently flat as a man’s palm, you\r\ncross a long groundswell which was not perceptible before, and on its\r\nfarther incline you come upon a chasm wide and deep enough to contain\r\na settlement. The aspect was by no means unprepossessing. Over the\r\nrolling surface, which, however, rarely breaks into hill and dale,\r\nlay a tapestry of thick grass already turning to a ruddy yellow under\r\nthe influence of approaching autumn. The uniformity was relieved by\r\nstreaks of livelier green in the rich soils of the slopes, hollows, and\r\nravines, where the water gravitates, and, in the deeper “intervales”\r\nand bottom lands on the banks of streams and courses, by the graceful\r\nundulations and the waving lines of mottes or prairie islands, thick\r\nclumps and patches simulating orchards by the side of cultivated\r\nfields. The silvery cirri and cumuli of the upper air flecked the\r\nsurface of earth with spots of dark cool shade, surrounded by a blaze\r\nof sunshine, and by their motion, as they trooped and chased one\r\nanother, gave a peculiar liveliness to the scene; while here and there\r\na bit of hazy blue distance, a swell of the sea-like land upon the far\r\nhorizon, gladdened the sight--every view is fair from afar. Nothing, I\r\nmay remark, is more monotonous, except perhaps the African and Indian\r\njungle, than those prairie tracts, where the circle of which you are\r\nthe centre has but about a mile of radius; it is an ocean in which one\r\nloses sight of land. You see, as it were, the ends of the earth, and\r\nlook around in vain for some object upon which the eye may rest: it\r\nwants the sublimity of repose so suggestive in the sandy deserts, and\r\nthe perpetual motion so pleasing in the aspect of the sea. No animals\r\nappeared in sight where, thirty years ago, a band of countless bisons\r\ndotted the plains; they will, however, like the wild aborigines, their\r\ncongeners, soon be followed by beings higher in the scale of creation.\r\nThese prairies are preparing to become the great grazing-grounds which\r\nshall supply the unpopulated East with herds of civilized kine, and\r\nperhaps with the yak of Tibet, the llama of South America, and the\r\nkoodoo and other African antelopes.\r\n\r\nAs we sped onward we soon made acquaintance with a traditionally\r\nfamiliar feature, the “pitch-holes,” or “chuck-holes”--the ugly word is\r\nnot inappropriate--which render traveling over the prairies at times\r\na sore task. They are gullies and gutters, not unlike the Canadian\r\n“cahues” of snow formation: varying from 10 to 50 feet in breadth,\r\nthey are rivulets in spring and early summer, and--few of them remain\r\nperennial--they lie dry during the rest of the year. Their banks are\r\nslightly raised, upon the principle, _in parvo_, that causes mighty\r\nrivers, like the Po and the Indus, to run along the crests of ridges,\r\nand usually there is in the sole a dry or wet cunette, steep as a\r\nstep, and not unfrequently stony; unless the break be attended to, it\r\nthreatens destruction to wheel and axle-tree, to hound and tongue. The\r\npitch-hole is more frequent where the prairies break into low hills;\r\nthe inclines along which the roads run then become a net-work of these\r\nAmerican nullahs.\r\n\r\n[SQUALOR.]\r\n\r\nPassing through a few wretched shanties[18] called Troy--last insult\r\nto the memory of hapless Pergamus--and Syracuse (here we are in the\r\nthird, or classic stage of United States nomenclature), we made, at 3\r\nP.M., Cold Springs, the junction of the Leavenworth route. Having taken\r\nthe northern road to avoid rough ground and bad bridges, we arrived\r\nabout two hours behind time. The aspect of things at Cold Springs,\r\nwhere we were allowed an hour’s halt to dine and to change mules,\r\nsomewhat dismayed our fine-weather prairie travelers. The scene was\r\nthe _rale_ “Far West.” The widow body to whom the shanty belonged lay\r\nsick with fever. The aspect of her family was a “caution to snakes:”\r\nthe ill-conditioned sons dawdled about, listless as Indians, in skin\r\ntunics and pantaloons fringed with lengthy tags such as the redoubtable\r\n“Billy Bowlegs” wears on tobacco labels; and the daughters, tall young\r\nwomen, whose sole attire was apparently a calico morning-wrapper, color\r\ninvisible, waited upon us in a protesting way. Squalor and misery were\r\nimprinted upon the wretched log hut, which ignored the duster and the\r\nbroom, and myriads of flies disputed with us a dinner consisting of\r\ndough-nuts, green and poisonous with saleratus, suspicious eggs in a\r\nmassive greasy fritter, and rusty bacon, intolerably fat. It was our\r\nfirst sight of squatter life, and, except in two cases, it was our\r\nworst. We could not grudge 50 cents a head to these unhappies; at the\r\nsame time, we thought it a dear price to pay--the sequel disabused\r\nus--for flies and bad bread, worse eggs and bacon.\r\n\r\n  [18] American authors derive the word from the Canadian _chienté_, a\r\n  dog-kennel. It is, however, I believe, originally Irish.\r\n\r\nThe next settlement, Valley Home, was reached at 6 P.M. Here the long\r\nwave of the ocean land broke into shorter seas, and for the first time\r\nthat day we saw stones, locally called rocks (a Western term embracing\r\nevery thing between a pebble and a boulder), the produce of nullahs\r\nand ravines. A well 10 to 12 feet deep supplied excellent water. The\r\nground was in places so far reclaimed as to be divided off by posts and\r\nrails; the scanty crops of corn (Indian corn), however, were wilted\r\nand withered by the drought, which this year had been unusually long.\r\nWithout changing mules we advanced to Kennekuk, where we halted for an\r\nhour’s supper under the auspices of Major Baldwin, whilom Indian agent;\r\nthe place was clean, and contained at least one charming face.\r\n\r\nKennekuk derives its name from a chief of the Kickapoos, in whose\r\nreservation we now are. This tribe, in the days of the Baron la Hontan\r\n(1689), a great traveler, but “aiblins,” as Sir Walter Scott said\r\nof his grandmither, “a prodigious story-teller,” then lived on the\r\nRivière des Puants, or Fox River, upon the brink of a little lake\r\nsupposed to be the Winnebago, near the Sakis (Osaki, Sawkis, Sauks,\r\nor Sacs),[19] and the Pouteoustamies (Potawotomies). They are still\r\nin the neighborhood of their dreaded foes, the Sacs and Foxes,[20]\r\nwho are described as stalwart and handsome bands, and they have been\r\naccompanied in their southern migration from the waters westward of\r\nthe Mississippi, through Illinois, to their present southern seats by\r\nother allies of the Winnebagoes,[21] the Iowas, Nez Percés, Ottoes,\r\nOmahas, Kansas, and Osages. Like the great nations of the Indian\r\nTerritory, the Cherokees, Creeks, Choctaws, and Chickasaws, they form\r\nintermediate social links in the chain of civilization between the\r\nouter white settlements and the wild nomadic tribes to the west, the\r\nDakotahs and Arapahoes, the Snakes and Cheyennes. They cultivate the\r\nsoil, and rarely spend the winter in hunting buffalo upon the plains.\r\nTheir reservation is twelve miles by twenty-four; as usual with land\r\nset apart for the savages, it is well watered and timbered, rich and\r\nfertile; it lies across the path and in the vicinity of civilization;\r\nconsequently, the people are greatly demoralized. The men are addicted\r\nto intoxication, and the women to unchastity; both sexes and all ages\r\nare inveterate beggars, whose principal industry is horse-stealing.\r\nThose Scottish clans were the most savage that vexed the Lowlands; it\r\nis the case here: the tribes nearest the settlers are best described\r\nby Colonel B----’s phrase, “great liars and dirty dogs.” They have\r\nwell-nigh cast off the Indian attire, and rejoice in the splendors of\r\nboiled and ruffled shirts, after the fashion of the whites. According\r\nto our host, a stalwart son of that soil which for generations has\r\nsent out her best blood westward, Kain-tuk-ee, the Land of the Cane,\r\nthe Kickapoos number about 300 souls, of whom one fifth are braves.\r\nHe quoted a specimen of their facetiousness: when they first saw\r\na crinoline, they pointed to the wearer and cried, “There walks a\r\nwigwam.” Our “vertugardin” of the 19th century has run the gauntlet of\r\nthe world’s jests, from the refined impertinence of Mr. Punch to the\r\nrude grumble of the American Indian and the Kaffir of the Cape.\r\n\r\n  [19] In the days of Major Pike, who, in 1805-6-7, explored, by order\r\n  of the government of the United States, the western territories of\r\n  North America, the Sacs numbered 700 warriors and 750 women; they\r\n  had four villages, and hunted on the Mississippi and its confluents\r\n  from the Illinois to the Iowa River, and on the western plains\r\n  that bordered on the Missouri. They were at peace with the Sioux,\r\n  Osages, Potawotomies, Menomenes or Folles Avoines, Iowas, and other\r\n  Missourian tribes, and were almost consolidated with the Foxes,\r\n  with whose aid they nearly exterminated the Illinois, Cahokias,\r\n  Kaskaskias, and Peorians. Their principal enemies were the Ojibwas.\r\n  They raised a considerable quantity of maize, beans, and melons, and\r\n  were celebrated for cunning in war rather than for courage.\r\n\r\n  [20] From the same source we learn that the Ottagamies, called by\r\n  the French Les Renards, numbered 400 warriors and 500 women: they\r\n  had three villages near the confluence of the Turkey River with the\r\n  Mississippi, hunted on both sides of the Mississippi from the Iowa\r\n  stream below the Prairie du Chien to a river of that name above\r\n  the same village, and annually sold many hundred bushels of maize.\r\n  Conjointly with the Sacs, the Foxes protected the Iowas, and the\r\n  three people, since the first treaty of the two former with the\r\n  United States, claimed the land from the entrance of the Jauflione\r\n  on the western side of the Mississippi, up the latter river to the\r\n  Iowa above the Prairie du Chien, and westward to the Missouri. In\r\n  1807 they had ceded their lands lying south of the Mississippi to the\r\n  United States, reserving to themselves, however, the privileges of\r\n  hunting and residing on them.\r\n\r\n  [21] The Winnebagoes, Winnipegs (turbid water), or Ochangras\r\n  numbered, in 1807, 450 warriors and 500 women, and had seven\r\n  villages on the Wisconsin, Rock, and Fox Rivers, and Green Bay:\r\n  their proximity enabled the tribe to muster in force within four\r\n  days. They then hunted on the Rock River, and the eastern side\r\n  of the Mississippi, from Rock River to the Prairie du Chien, on\r\n  Lake Michigan, on Black River, and in the countries between Lakes\r\n  Michigan, Huron, and Superior. Lieutenant Pike is convinced, “from a\r\n  tradition among themselves, and their speaking the same language as\r\n  the Ottoes of the Platte River,” that they are a tribe who about 150\r\n  years before his time had fled from the oppression of the Mexican\r\n  Spaniards, and had become clients of the Sioux. They have ever been\r\n  distinguished for ferocity and treachery.\r\n\r\n[“CRIK.”]\r\n\r\nBeyond Kennekuk we crossed the first Grasshopper Creek. Creek, I must\r\nwarn the English reader, is pronounced “crik,” and in these lands, as\r\nin the jargon of Australia, means not “an arm of the sea,” but a small\r\nstream of sweet water, a rivulet; the rivers of Europe, according\r\nto the Anglo-American of the West, are “criks.” On our line there\r\nare many grasshopper creeks; they anastomose with, or debouch into,\r\nthe Kansas River, and they reach the sea _viâ_ the Missouri and the\r\nMississippi. This particular Grasshopper was dry and dusty up to the\r\nankles; timber clothed the banks, and slabs of sandstone cumbered the\r\nsole. Our next obstacle was the Walnut Creek, which we found, however,\r\nprovided with a corduroy bridge; formerly it was a dangerous ford,\r\nrolling down heavy streams of melted snow, and then crossed by means\r\nof the “bouco” or coracle, two hides sewed together, distended like a\r\nleather tub with willow rods, and poled or paddled. At this point the\r\ncountry is unusually well populated; a house appears after every mile.\r\nBeyond Walnut Creek a dense nimbus, rising ghost-like from the northern\r\nhorizon, furnished us with a spectacle of those perilous prairie storms\r\nwhich make the prudent lay aside their revolvers and disembarrass\r\nthemselves of their cartridges. Gusts of raw, cold, and violent wind\r\nfrom the west whizzed overhead, thunder crashed and rattled closer and\r\ncloser, and vivid lightning, flashing out of the murky depths around,\r\nmade earth and air one blaze of living fire. Then the rain began to\r\npatter ominously upon the carriages; the canvas, however, by swelling,\r\ndid its duty in becoming water-tight, and we rode out the storm dry.\r\nThose learned in the weather predicted a succession of such outbursts,\r\nbut the prophecy was not fulfilled. The thermometer fell about 6° (F.),\r\nand a strong north wind set in, blowing dust or gravel, a fair specimen\r\nof “Kansas gales,” which are equally common in Nebraska, especially\r\nduring the month of October. It subsided on the 9th of August.\r\n\r\nArriving about 1 A.M. at Locknan’s Station, a few log and timber huts\r\nnear a creek well feathered with white oak and American elm, hickory\r\nand black walnut, we found beds and snatched an hourful of sleep.\r\n\r\n  _8th August, to Rock Creek._\r\n\r\nResuming, through air refrigerated by rain, our now weary way, we\r\nreached at 6 A.M. a favorite camping-ground, the “Big Nemehaw” Creek,\r\nwhich, like its lesser neighbor, flows after rain into the Missouri\r\nRiver, _viâ_ Turkey Creek, the Big Blue, and the Kansas. It is a fine\r\nbottom of rich black soil, whose green woods at that early hour were\r\nwet with heavy dew, and scattered over the surface lay pebbles and\r\nblocks of quartz and porphyritic granites. “Richland,” a town mentioned\r\nin guide-books, having disappeared, we drove for breakfast to Seneca, a\r\ncity consisting of a few shanties, mostly garnished with tall square\r\nlumber fronts, ineffectually, especially when the houses stand one by\r\none, masking the diminutiveness of the buildings behind them. The land,\r\nprobably in prospect of a Pacific Railroad, fetched the exaggerated\r\nprice of $20 an acre, and already a lawyer has “hung out his shingle”\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nRefreshed by breakfast and the intoxicating air, brisk as a bottle of\r\n_veuve Clicquot_--it is this that gives one the “prairie fever”--we\r\nbade glad adieu to Seneca, and prepared for another long stretch of\r\ntwenty-four hours. That day’s chief study was of wagons, those ships\r\nof the great American Sahara which, gathering in fleets at certain\r\nseasons, conduct the traffic between the eastern and the western\r\nshores of a waste which is every where like a sea, and which presently\r\nwill become salt. The white-topped wain--banished by railways from\r\nPennsylvania, where, drawn by the “Conestoga horse,” it once formed a\r\nmarked feature in the landscape--has found a home in the Far West. They\r\nare not unpicturesque from afar, these long-winding trains, in early\r\nmorning like lines of white cranes trooping slowly over the prairie, or\r\nin more mysterious evening resembling dim sails crossing a rolling sea.\r\nThe vehicles are more simple than our Cape wagons--huge beds like punts\r\nmounted on solid wheels, with logs for brakes, and contrasting strongly\r\nwith the emerald plain, white tilts of twilled cotton or osnaburg,\r\nsupported by substantial oaken or hickory bows. The wain is literally\r\na “prairie ship:” its body is often used as a ferry, and when hides\r\nare unprocurable the covering is thus converted into a “bull boat.”\r\nTwo stakes driven into the ground, to mark the length, are connected\r\nby a longitudinal keel and ribs of willow rods; cross-sticks are tied\r\nwith thongs to prevent “caving in,” and the canvas is strained over\r\nthe frame-work. In this part of the country the wagon is unnecessarily\r\nheavy; made to carry 4000 lbs., it rarely carries 3000: westward I have\r\nseen many a load of 3¹⁄₂ tons of 2000 lbs. each, and have heard of even\r\n6 tons. The wheels are of northern white oak, well seasoned under pain\r\nof perpetual repairs, the best material, “bow-dark” Osage orange-wood\r\n(_bois d’arc_ or _Maclura aurantiaca_), which shrinks but little, being\r\nrarely procurable about Concord and Troy, the great centres of wagon\r\nmanufacture. The neap or tongue (pole) is jointed where it enters the\r\nhounds, or these will be broken by the heavy jolts; and the perch is\r\noften made movable, so that after accidents a temporary conveyance\r\ncan be made out of the débris. A long covered wooden box hangs\r\nbehind: on the road it carries fuel; at the halt it becomes a trough,\r\nbeing preferred to nose-bags, which prevent the animals breathing\r\ncomfortably; and in the hut, where every part of the wagon is utilized,\r\nit acts as a chest for valuables. A bucket swings beneath the vehicle,\r\nand it is generally provided with an extra chain for “coraling.” The\r\nteams vary in number from six to thirteen yoke; they are usually oxen,\r\nan “Old Country” prejudice operating against the use of cows.[22] The\r\nyoke, of pine or other light wood, is, as every where in the States,\r\nsimple and effective, presenting a curious contrast to the uneasy\r\nand uncertain contrivances which still prevail in the antiquated\r\nCampagna and other classic parts of Europe. A heavy cross-piece, oak\r\nor cotton-wood, is beveled out in two places, and sometimes lined with\r\nsheet-lead, to fit the animals’ necks, which are held firm in bows of\r\nbent hickory passing through the yoke and pinned above. The several\r\npairs of cattle are connected by strong chains and rings projecting\r\nfrom the under part of the wood-work.\r\n\r\n  [22] According to Mormon rule, however, the full team consists of\r\n  one wagon (12 ft. long, 3 ft. 4 in. wide, and 18 in. deep), two\r\n  yoke of oxen, and two milch cows. The Saints have ever excelled in\r\n  arrangements for travel by land and sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WESTERN YOKE.]\r\n\r\n[THE “RIPPER.”]\r\n\r\nThe “ripper,” or driver, who is bound to the gold regions of Pike’s\r\nPeak, is a queer specimen of humanity. He usually hails from one of\r\nthe old Atlantic cities--in fact, from settled America--and, like\r\nthe civilized man generally, he betrays a remarkable aptitude for\r\nfacile descent into savagery. His dress is a harlequinade, typical\r\nof his disposition. Eschewing the chimney-pot or stove-pipe tile of\r\nthe bourgeois, he affects the “Kossuth,” an Anglo-American version\r\nof the sombrero, which converts felt into every shape and form, from\r\nthe jaunty little head-covering of the modern sailor to the tall\r\nsteeple-crown of the old Puritan. He disregards the trichotomy of St.\r\nPaul, and emulates St. Anthony and the American aborigines in the\r\nlength of his locks, whose ends are curled inward, with a fascinating\r\nsausage-like roll not unlike the Cockney “aggrawator.” If a young hand,\r\nhe is probably in the buckskin mania, which may pass into the squaw\r\nmania, a disease which knows no cure: the symptoms are, a leather coat\r\nand overalls to match, embroidered if possible, and finished along the\r\narms and legs with fringes cut as long as possible, while a pair of\r\ngaudy moccasins, resplendent with red and blue porcelain beads, fits\r\nhis feet tightly as silken hose. I have heard of coats worth $250,\r\nvests $100, and pants $150: indeed, the poorest of buckskin suits will\r\ncost $75, and if hard-worked it must be renewed every six months. The\r\nsuccessful miner or the gambler--in these lands the word is confined\r\nto the profession--will add $10 gold buttons to the attractions of his\r\nattire. The older hand prefers to buckskin a “wamba” or round-about, a\r\nred or rainbow-colored flannel over a check cotton shirt; his lower\r\ngarments, garnished _a tergo_ with leather, are turned into Hessians\r\nby being thrust inside his cow-hide Wellingtons; and, when in riding\r\ngear, he wraps below each knee a fold of deer, antelope, or cow skin,\r\nwith edges scalloped where they fall over the feet, and gartered\r\ntightly against thorns and stirrup thongs, thus effecting that graceful\r\nelephantine bulge of the lower leg for which “Jack ashore” is justly\r\ncelebrated. Those who suffer from sore eyes wear huge green goggles,\r\nwhich give a crab-like air to the physiognomy, and those who can not\r\nprocure them line the circumorbital region with lampblack, which is\r\nsupposed to act like the surma or kohl of the Orient. A broad leather\r\nbelt supports on the right a revolver, generally Colt’s Navy or medium\r\nsize (when Indian fighting is expected, the large dragoon pistol is\r\nuniversally preferred); and on the left, in a plain black sheath, or\r\nsometimes in the more ornamental Spanish scabbard, is a buck-horn or\r\nivory-handled bowie-knife. In the East the driver partially conceals\r\nhis tools; he has no such affectation in the Far West: moreover, a\r\nglance through the wagon-awning shows guns and rifles stowed along\r\nthe side. When driving he is armed with a mammoth fustigator, a\r\nsystem of plaited cow-hides cased with smooth leather; it is a knout\r\nor an Australian stock-whip, which, managed with both hands, makes\r\nthe sturdiest ox curve and curl its back. If he trudges along an\r\nox-team, he is a grim and grimy man, who delights to startle your\r\nanimals with a whip-crack, and disdains to return a salutation: if\r\nhis charge be a muleteer’s, you may expect more urbanity; he is then\r\nin the “upper-crust” of teamsters; he knows it, and demeans himself\r\naccordingly. He can do nothing without whisky, which he loves to call\r\ntarantula juice, strychnine, red-eye, corn juice, Jersey lightning,\r\nleg-stretcher, “tangle-leg,”[23] and many other hard and grotesque\r\nnames; he chews tobacco like a horse; he becomes heavier “_on_ the\r\nshoulder” or “_on_ the shyoot,” as, with the course of empire, he\r\nmakes his way westward; and he frequently indulges in a “spree,” which\r\nin these lands means four acts of drinking-bout, with a fifth of\r\nrough-and-tumble. Briefly, he is a post-wagon driver exaggerated.\r\n\r\n  [23] For instance, “whisky is now tested by the distance a man can\r\n  walk after tasting it. The new liquor called ‘Tangle-leg’ is said to\r\n  be made of diluted alcohol, nitric acid, pepper, and tobacco, and\r\n  will upset a man at a distance of 400 yards from the demijohn.”\r\n\r\n[THE PRAIRIE SADDLE.]\r\n\r\nEach train is accompanied by men on horse or mule back--oxen are not\r\nridden after Cape fashion in these lands.[24] The equipment of the\r\ncavalier excited my curiosity, especially the saddle, which has been\r\nrecommended by good authorities for military use. The coming days of\r\nfast warfare, when “heavies,” if not wholly banished to the limbo of\r\nthings that were, will be used as mounted “beef-eaters,” only for show,\r\ndemand a saddle with as little weight as is consistent with strength,\r\nand one equally easy to the horse and the rider. In no branch of\r\nimprovement, except in hat-making for the army, has so little been done\r\nas in saddles. The English military or hunting implement still endures\r\nwithout other merit than facility to the beast, and, in the man’s\r\ncase, faculty of falling uninjured with his horse. Unless the rider be\r\ncopper-lined and iron-limbed, it is little better in long marches than\r\na rail for riding. As far as convenience is concerned, an Arab pad is\r\npreferable to Peat’s best. But the Californian saddle can not supply\r\nthe deficiency, as will, I think, appear in the course of description.\r\n\r\n  [24] Captain Marcy, in quoting Mr. Andersson’s remarks on ox-riding\r\n  in Southwestern Africa, remarks that “a ring instead of a stick\r\n  put through the cartilage of the animal’s nose would obviate the\r\n  difficulty of managing it.” As in the case of the camel, a ring would\r\n  soon be torn out by an obstinate beast: a stick resists.\r\n\r\nThe native Indian saddle is probably the degenerate offspring of the\r\nEuropean pack-saddle: two short forks, composing the pommel and cantle,\r\nare nailed or lashed to a pair of narrow sideboards, and the rude\r\ntree is kept in shape by a green skin or hide allowed to shrink on.\r\nIt remarkably resembles the Abyssinian, the Somal, and the Circassian\r\nsaddle, which, like the “dug-out” canoe, is probably the primitive form\r\ninstinctively invented by mankind. It is the sire of the civilized\r\nsaddle, which in these lands varies with every region. The Texan is\r\nknown by its circular seat; a string passed round the tree forms a\r\nring: provided with flaps after the European style, it is considered\r\neasy and comfortable. The Californian is rather oval than circular;\r\nborrowed and improved from the Mexican, it has spread from the Pacific\r\nto the Atlantic slope of the Rocky Mountains, and the hardy and\r\nexperienced mountaineer prefers it to all others: it much resembles the\r\nHungarian, and in some points recalls to mind the old French cavalry\r\ndemipique. It is composed of a single tree of light strong wood,\r\nadmitting a freer circulation of air to the horse’s spine--an immense\r\nadvantage--and, being without iron, it can readily be taken to pieces,\r\ncleaned or mended, and refitted. The tree is strengthened by a covering\r\nof raw-hide carefully sewed on; it rests upon a “sweat-leather,” a\r\npadded sheet covering the back, and it is finished off behind with an\r\n“anchero” of the same material protecting the loins. The pommel is\r\nhigh, like the crutch of a woman’s saddle, rendering impossible, under\r\npain of barking the knuckles, that rule of good riding which directs\r\nthe cavalier to keep his hands low. It prevents the inexperienced\r\nhorseman being thrown forward, and enables him to “hold on” when\r\nlikely to be dismounted; in the case of a good rider, its only use\r\nis to attach the lariat, riata, or lasso. The great merit of this\r\n“unicorn” saddle is its girthing: with the English system, the strain\r\nof a wild bull or of a mustang “bucker” would soon dislodge the riding\r\ngear. The “sincho” is an elastic horsehair cingle, five to six inches\r\nwide, connected with “lariat straps,” strong thongs passing round the\r\npommel and cantle; it is girthed well back from the horse’s shoulder,\r\nand can be drawn till the animal suffers pain: instead of buckle,\r\nthe long terminating strap is hitched two or three times through an\r\niron ring. The whole saddle is covered with a machila, here usually\r\npronounced _macheer_, two pieces of thick leather handsomely and\r\nfancifully worked or stamped, joined by a running thong in the centre,\r\nand open to admit the pommel and cantle. If too long, it draws in the\r\nstirrup-leathers, and cramps the ankles of any but a bowlegged man.\r\nThe machila is sometimes garnished with pockets, always with straps\r\nbehind to secure a valise, and a cloak can be fastened over the pommel,\r\ngiving purchase and protection to the knees. The rider sits erect, with\r\nthe legs in a continuation of the body line, and the security of the\r\nbalance-seat enables him to use his arms freely: the _pose_ is that of\r\nthe French schools in the last century, heels up and toes down. The\r\nadvantages of this equipment are obvious; it is easier to horse and\r\nman probably than any yet invented. On the other hand, the quantity\r\nof leather renders it expensive: without silver or other ornaments,\r\nthe price would vary from $25 at San Francisco to $50 at Great Salt\r\nLake City, and the highly got-up rise to $250 = £50 for a saddle! If\r\nthe saddle-cloth slips out, and this is an accident which frequently\r\noccurs, the animal’s back will be galled. The stirrup-leathers can not\r\nbe shortened or lengthened without dismounting, and without leggins the\r\nboard-like leather _macheer_ soon makes the _mollets_ innocent of skin.\r\nThe pommel is absolutely dangerous: during my short stay in the country\r\nI heard of two accidents, one fatal, caused by the rider being thrown\r\nforward on his fork. Finally, the long seat, which is obligatory,\r\nanswers admirably with the Californian pacer or canterer, but with the\r\nhigh-trotting military horse it would inevitably lead--as has been\r\nproved before the European stirrup-leather was shortened--to hernias\r\nand other accidents.\r\n\r\nTo the stirrups I have but one serious objection--they can not be made\r\nto open in case of the horse falling; when inside the stiff leather\r\n_macheer_, they cramp the legs by bowing them inward, but habit soon\r\ncures this. Instead of the light iron contrivances which before\r\nrecovered play against the horse’s side, which freeze the feet in cold,\r\nand which toast them in hot weather, this stirrup is sensibly made of\r\nwood. In the Eastern States it is a lath bent somewhat in the shape of\r\nthe dragoon form, and has too little weight; the Californian article\r\nis cut out of a solid block of wood, mountain mahogany being the best,\r\nthen maple, and lastly the softer pine and cotton-wood. In some parts\r\nof the country it is made so narrow that only the toe fits in, and then\r\nthe instep is liable to be bruised. For riding through bush and thorns,\r\nit is provided in front with zapateros or leathern curtains, secured\r\nto the straps above, and to the wood on both sides: they are curiously\r\nmade, and the size, like that of the Turk’s lantern, denotes the\r\nowner’s fashionableness; dandies may be seen with the pointed angles\r\nof their stirrup-guards dangling almost to the ground. The article\r\nwas borrowed from Mexico--the land of character dresses. When riding\r\nthrough prickly chapparal, the leathers begin higher up, and protect\r\nthe leg from the knee downward. I would not recommend this stirrup for\r\nHyde Park, or even Brighton; but in India and other barbarous parts of\r\nthe British empire, where, on a cold morning’s march, men and officers\r\nmay be seen with wisps of straw defending their feet from the iron,\r\nand on African journeys, where the bush is more than a match for any\r\ntexture yet woven, it might, methinks, be advantageously used.\r\n\r\n[THE PRAIRIE SPUR.]\r\n\r\nThe same may be said of the spurs, which, though cruel in appearance,\r\nare really more merciful than ours. The rowels have spikes about two\r\ninches long; in fact, are the shape and size of a small starfish; but\r\nthey are never sharpened, and the tinkle near the animal’s sides serves\r\nto urge it on without a real application. The two little bell-like\r\npendants of metal on each side of the rowel-hinge serve to increase\r\nthe rattling, and when a poor rider is mounted upon a tricksy horse,\r\nthey lock the rowels, which are driven into the sincho, and thus afford\r\nanother _point d’appui_. If the rider’s legs be long enough, the spurs\r\ncan be clinched under the pony’s belly. Like the Mexican, they can be\r\nmade expensive: $25 a pair would be a common price.\r\n\r\n[BRIDLE.]\r\n\r\nThe bridle is undoubtedly the worst part of the horse’s furniture. The\r\nbit is long, clumsy, and not less cruel than a Chifney. I have seen\r\nthe Arab ring, which, with sufficient leverage, will break a horse’s\r\njaw, and another, not unlike an East Indian invention, with a sharp\r\ntriangle to press upon the animal’s palate, apparently for the purpose\r\nof causing it to rear and fall backward. It is the offspring of the\r\nMexican manége, which was derived, through Spain, from the Moors.\r\n\r\nPassing through Ash Point at 9 30 A.M., and halting for water at Uncle\r\nJohn’s Grocery, where hang-dog Indians, squatting, standing, and\r\nstalking about, showed that the forbidden luxury--essence of corn--was,\r\ndespite regulations, not unprocurable there, we spanned the prairie to\r\nGuittard’s Station. This is a clump of board houses on the far side of\r\na shady, well-wooded creek--the Vermilion, a tributary of the Big Blue\r\nRiver, so called from its red sandstone bottom, dotted with granitic\r\nand porphyritic boulders.\r\n\r\nOur conductor had sprained his ankle, and the driver, being in plain\r\nEnglish drunk, had dashed like a Phaeton over the “chuck-holes;” we\r\nwillingly, therefore, halted at 11 30 A.M. for dinner. The host was a\r\nyoung Alsatian, who, with his mother and sister, had emigrated under\r\nthe excitement of Californian fever, and had been stopped, by want of\r\nmeans, half way. The improvement upon the native was palpable: the\r\nhouse and kitchen were clean, the fences neat; the ham and eggs, the\r\nhot rolls and coffee, were fresh and good, and, although drought had\r\nkilled the salad, we had abundance of peaches and cream, an offering of\r\nFrench to American taste which, in its simplicity, luxuriates in the\r\ncurious mixture of lacteal with hydrocyanic acid.\r\n\r\nAt Guittard’s I saw, for the first time, the Pony Express rider arrive.\r\nIn March, 1860, “the great dream of news transmitted from New York to\r\nSan Francisco (more strictly speaking from St. Joseph to Placerville,\r\nCalifornia) in eight days was tested.” It appeared, in fact, under the\r\nform of an advertisement in the St. Louis “Republican,”[25] and threw\r\nat once into the shade the great Butterfield Mail, whose expedition\r\nhad been the theme of universal praise. Very meritoriously has the\r\ncontract been fulfilled. At the moment of writing (Nov., 1860), the\r\ndistance between New York and San Francisco has been farther reduced by\r\nthe advance of the electric telegraph--it proceeds at the rate of six\r\nmiles a day--to Fort Kearney from the Mississippi and to Fort Churchill\r\nfrom the Pacific side. The merchant thus receives his advices in six\r\ndays. The contract of the government with Messrs. Russell, Majors, and\r\nCo., to run the mail from St. Joseph to Great Salt Lake City, expired\r\nthe 30th of November, and it was proposed to, continue it only from\r\nJulesburg on the crossing of the South Platte, 480 miles west of St.\r\nJoseph. Mr. Russell, however, objected, and so did the Western States\r\ngenerally, to abbreviating the mail-service as contemplated by the\r\nPost-office Department. His spirit and energy met with supporters whose\r\ninterest it was not to fall back on the times when a communication\r\nbetween New York and California could not be secured short of\r\ntwenty-five or thirty days; and, aided by the newspapers, he obtained\r\na renewal of his contract. The riders are mostly youths, mounted upon\r\nactive and lithe Indian nags. They ride 100 miles at a time--about\r\neight per hour--with four changes of horses, and return to their\r\nstations the next day: of their hardships and perils we shall hear more\r\nanon. The letters are carried in leathern bags, which are thrown about\r\ncarelessly enough when the saddle is changed, and the average postage\r\nis $5 = £1 per sheet.\r\n\r\n  [25] The following is the first advertisement:\r\n\r\n  “_To San Francisco in eight days, by the Central Overland California\r\n  and Pike’s Peak Express Company._\r\n\r\n  “The first courier of the ‘Pony Express’ will leave the Missouri\r\n  River on Tuesday, April the 3d, at -- o’clock P.M., and will run\r\n  regularly weekly hereafter, carrying a letter mail only. The point\r\n  on the Missouri River will be in telegraphic communication with the\r\n  East, and will be announced in due time.\r\n\r\n  “Telegraphic messages from all parts of the United States and\r\n  Canada, in connection with the point of departure, will be received\r\n  up to 5 o’clock P.M. of the day of leaving, and transmitted over\r\n  the Placerville and St. Joseph Telegraph-wire to San Francisco and\r\n  intermediate points by the connecting Express in eight days. The\r\n  letter mail will be delivered in San Francisco in ten days from the\r\n  departure of the Express. The Express passes through Forts Kearney,\r\n  Laramie, and Bridger, Great Salt Lake City, Camp Floyd, Carson City,\r\n  the Washoe Silver Mines, Placerville, and Sacramento. And letters for\r\n  Oregon, Washington Territory, British Columbia, the Pacific Mexican\r\n  Ports, Russian Possessions, Sandwich Islands, China, Japan, and\r\n  India, will be mailed in San Francisco.\r\n\r\n  “Special messengers, bearers of letters, to connect with the Express\r\n  of the 3d April, will receive communications for the Courier of that\r\n  day at No. 481 Tenth Street, Washington City, up to 2 45 P.M. on\r\n  Friday, March 30th; and in New York, at the office of J.B. Simpson,\r\n  Room No. 8 Continental Bank Building, Nassau Street, up to 6 50 A.M.\r\n  of 31st March.\r\n\r\n  “Full particulars can be obtained on application at the above places,\r\n  and from the Agents of the Company.\r\n\r\n  W. H. RUSSELL, President.\r\n\r\n  “Leavenworth City, Kansas, March, 1860.\r\n\r\n“_Office, New York._--J. B. Simpson, Vice-President; Samuel and Allen,\r\nAgents, St. Louis, Mo.; H. J. Spaulding, Agent, Chicago.”\r\n\r\n[THE PRAIRIE FIRES.]\r\n\r\nBeyond Guittard’s the prairies bore a burnt-up aspect. Far as the eye\r\ncould see the tintage was that of the Arabian Desert, sere and tawny\r\nas a jackal’s back. It was still, however, too early; October is the\r\nmonth for those prairie fires which have so frequently exercised the\r\nWestern author’s pen. Here, however, the grass is too short for the\r\nfull development of the phenomenon, and beyond the Little Blue River\r\nthere is hardly any risk. The fire can easily be stopped, _ab initio_,\r\nby blankets, or by simply rolling a barrel; the African plan of beating\r\ndown with boughs might also be used in certain places; and when the\r\nconflagration has extended, travelers can take refuge in a little Zoar\r\nby burning the vegetation to windward. In Texas and Illinois, however,\r\nwhere the grass is tall and rank, and the roaring flames leap before\r\nthe wind with the stride of maddened horses, the danger is imminent,\r\nand the spectacle must be one of awful sublimity.\r\n\r\nIn places where the land seems broken with bluffs, like an iron-bound\r\ncoast, the skeleton of the earth becomes visible; the formation is a\r\nfriable sandstone, overlying fossiliferous lime, which is based upon\r\nbeds of shale. These undergrowths show themselves at the edges of the\r\nground-waves and in the dwarf precipices, where the soil has been\r\ndegraded by the action of water. The yellow-brown humus varies from\r\nforty to sixty feet deep in the most favored places, and erratic blocks\r\nof porphyry and various granites encumber the dry water-courses and\r\nsurface drains. In the rare spots where water then lay, the herbage was\r\nstill green, forming oases in the withering waste, and showing that\r\nirrigation is its principal, if not its only want.\r\n\r\nPassing by Marysville, in old maps Palmetto City, a county town which\r\nthrives by selling whisky to ruffians of all descriptions, we forded\r\nbefore sunset the “Big Blue,” a well-known tributary of the Kansas\r\nRiver. It is a pretty little stream, brisk and clear as crystal, about\r\nforty or fifty yards wide by 2·50 feet deep at the ford. The soil is\r\nsandy and solid, but the banks are too precipitous to be pleasant when\r\na very drunken driver hangs on by the lines of four very weary mules.\r\nWe then stretched once more over the “divide”--the ground, generally\r\nrough or rolling, between the fork or junction of two streams, in\r\nfact, the Indian Doab--separating the Big Blue from its tributary\r\nthe Little Blue. At 6 P.M. we changed our fagged animals for fresh,\r\nand the land of Kansas for Nebraska, at Cotton-wood Creek, a bottom\r\nwhere trees flourished, where the ground had been cleared for corn,\r\nand where we detected the prairie wolf watching for the poultry. The\r\nfur of our first coyote was light yellow-brown, with a tinge of red,\r\nthe snout long and sharp, the tail bushy and hanging, the gait like a\r\ndog’s, and the manner expressive of extreme timidity; it is a far more\r\ncowardly animal than the larger white buffalo-wolf and the black wolf\r\nof the woods, which are also far from fierce. At Cotton-wood Station we\r\ntook “on board” two way-passengers, “lady” and “gentleman,” who were\r\ndrafted into the wagon containing the Judiciary. A weary drive over a\r\nrough and dusty road, through chill night air and clouds of musquetoes,\r\nwhich we were warned would accompany us to the Pacific slope of the\r\nRocky Mountains, placed us about 10 P.M. at Rock, also called Turkey\r\nCreek--surely a misnomer; no turkey ever haunted so villainous a\r\nspot! Several passengers began to suffer from fever and nausea; in\r\nsuch travel the second night is usually the crisis, after which a man\r\ncan endure for an indefinite time. The “ranch” was a nice place for\r\ninvalids, especially for those of the softer sex. Upon the bedded floor\r\nof the foul “doggery” lay, in a seemingly promiscuous heap, men, women,\r\nchildren, lambs, and puppies, all fast in the arms of Morpheus, and\r\nmany under the influence of a much jollier god. The _employés_, when\r\naroused pretty roughly, blinked their eyes in the atmosphere of smoke\r\nand musquetoes, and declared that it had been “merry in hall” that\r\nnight--the effects of which merriment had not passed off. After half an\r\nhour’s dispute about who should do the work, they produced cold scraps\r\nof mutton and a kind of bread which deserves a totally distinct generic\r\nname. The strongest stomachs of the party made tea, and found some milk\r\nwhich was not more than one quarter flies. This succulent meal was\r\nfollowed by the usual douceur. On this road, however mean or wretched\r\nthe fare, the station-keeper, who is established by the proprietor of\r\nthe line, never derogates by lowering his price.\r\n\r\n[LITTLE BLUE RIVER VALLEY.]\r\n\r\n  _The Valley of the Little Blue, 9th August._\r\n\r\nA little after midnight we resumed our way, and in the state\r\nwhich Mohammed described when he made his famous night journey to\r\nheaven--_bayni ’l naumi wa ’l yakzán_--we crossed the deep shingles,\r\nthe shallow streams, and the heavy vegetation of the Little Sandy, and\r\nfive miles beyond it we forded the Big Sandy. About early dawn we found\r\nourselves at another station, better than the last only as the hour was\r\nmore propitious. The colony of Patlanders rose from their beds without\r\na dream of ablution, and clearing the while their lungs of Cork brogue,\r\nprepared a neat _déjeûner à la fourchette_ by hacking “fids” off half\r\na sheep suspended from the ceiling, and frying them in melted tallow.\r\nHad the action occurred in Central Africa, among the Esquimaux, or the\r\nAraucanians, it would not have excited my attention: mere barbarism\r\nrarely disgusts; it is the unnatural cohabitation of civilization with\r\nsavagery that makes the traveler’s gorge rise.\r\n\r\nIssuing from Big Sandy Station at 6 30 A.M., and resuming our route\r\nover the divide that still separated the valleys of the Big Blue and\r\nthe Little Blue, we presently fell into the line of the latter, and\r\nwere called upon by the conductor to admire it. It is pretty, but\r\nits beauties require the cosmetic which is said to act unfailingly\r\nin the case of fairer things--the viewer should have lately spent\r\nthree months at sea, out of sight of rivers and women. Averaging\r\ntwo miles in width, which shrinks to one quarter as you ascend, the\r\nvalley is hedged on both sides by low rolling bluffs or terraces,\r\nthe boundaries of its ancient bed and modern debordements. As the\r\nhills break off near the river, they show a diluvial formation; in\r\nplaces they are washed into a variety of forms, and being white, they\r\nstand out in bold relief. In other parts they are sand mixed with\r\nsoil enough to support a last-year’s growth of wheat-like grass,\r\nweed-stubble, and dead trees, that look like old corn-fields in new\r\nclearings. One could not have recognized at this season Colonel\r\nFrémont’s description written in the month of June--the “hills with\r\ngraceful slopes looking uncommonly green and beautiful.” Along the\r\nbluffs the road winds, crossing at times a rough projecting spur,\r\nor dipping into some gully washed out by the rains of ages. All is\r\nbarren beyond the garden-reach which runs along the stream; there is\r\nnot a tree to a square mile--in these regions the tree, like the bird\r\nin Arabia and the monkey in Africa, signifies water--and animal life\r\nseems well-nigh extinct. As the land sinks toward the river bottom,\r\nit becomes less barren. The wild sunflower (_Helianthus_)--it seldom,\r\nhowever, turns toward the sun--now becomes abundant; it was sparse\r\nnear the Missouri; it will wax even more plentiful around Great Salt\r\nLake City, till walking through the beds becomes difficult. In size\r\nit greatly varies according to the quality of the soil; six feet is\r\nperhaps the maximum. It is a growth of some value. The oleaginous seeds\r\nform the principal food of half-starved Indians, while the stalks\r\nsupply them with a scanty fuel: being of rapid growth, it has been used\r\nin the States to arrest the flow of malaria, and it serves as house\r\nand home to the rattlesnake. Conspicuous by its side is the sumach,\r\nwhose leaf, mixed with kinnikinik, the peel of the red willow, forms\r\nthe immemorial smoking material of the Wild Man of the North. Equally\r\nremarkable for their strong odor are large beds of wild onions; they\r\nare superlatively wholesome, but they effect the eater like those of\r\nTibet. The predominant colors are pink and yellow, the former a lupine,\r\nthe latter a shrub, locally called the rabbit-bush. The blue lupine\r\nalso appears with the white mallow, the eccentric putoria, and the\r\ntaraxacum (dandelion), so much used as salad in France and in the\r\nEastern States. This land appears excellently adapted for the growth\r\nof manioc or cassava. In the centre of the bottom flows the brownish\r\nstream, about twenty yards wide, between two dense lines of tall sweet\r\ncotton-wood. The tree which was fated to become familiar to us during\r\nour wanderings is a species of poplar (_P. monilifera_), called by the\r\nAmerico-Spaniards, and by the people of Texas and New Mexico, “Alamo:”\r\nresembling the European aspen, without its silver lining, the color of\r\nthe leaf, in places, appears of a dull burnished hue, in others bright\r\nand refreshingly green. Its trivial name is derived, according to some,\r\nfrom the fibrous quality of the bark, which, as in Norway, is converted\r\ninto food for cattle and even man; according to others, from the\r\ncotton-like substance surrounding the seeds. It is termed “sweet” to\r\ndistinguish it from a different tree with a bitter bark, also called a\r\ncotton-wood or narrow-leaved cotton-wood (_Populus angustifolia_), and\r\nby the Canadians _liard amère_. The timber is soft and easily cut; it\r\nis in many places the only material for building and burning, and the\r\nrecklessness of the squatters has already shortened the supply.\r\n\r\nThis valley is the Belgium of the adjoining tribes, the once terrible\r\nPawnees, who here met their enemies, the Dakotahs and the Delawares: it\r\nwas then a great buffalo ground; and even twenty years ago it was well\r\nstocked with droves of wild horses, turkeys, and herds of antelope,\r\ndeer, and elk. The animals have of late migrated westward, carrying\r\noff with them the “bones of contention.” Some details concerning\r\nthe present condition of these bands and their neighbors may not be\r\nuninteresting--these poor remnants of nations which once kept the\r\npower of North America at bay, and are now barely able to struggle for\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nIn 1853, the government of the United States, which has ever acted\r\npaternally toward the Indians, treating with them--Great Britain\r\ndid the same with the East Indians--as though they were a civilized\r\npeople, availed itself of the savages’ desire to sell lands encroached\r\nupon by the whites, and set apart for a general reservation 181,171\r\nsquare miles. Here, in the Far West, were collected into what was then\r\nbelieved to be a permanent habitation, the indigenes of the land, and\r\nthe various bands once lying east of the Mississippi. This “Indian’s\r\nhome” was bounded, in 1853, on the north by the Northwestern Territory\r\nand Minnesota; on the south by Texas and New Mexico; to the east lay\r\nIowa, Missouri, and Arkansas; and to the west, Oregon, Utah, and New\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nThe savages’ reservation was then thus distributed. The eastern\r\nportion nearest the river was stocked with tribes removed to it from\r\nthe Eastern States, namely, the Iowas, Sacs and Foxes, Kickapoos,\r\nDelawares, Potawotomies, Wyandottes, Quapaws, Senecas, Cherokees,\r\nSeminoles, Creeks, Choctaws, Chickasaws, Miamis, and Ottawas. The\r\nwest and part of the northeast--poor and barren lands--were retained\r\nby the aboriginal tribes, Ponkahs, Omahas or Mahas, Pawnees, Ottoes,\r\nKansas or Konzas, and Osages. The central and the remainder of the\r\nwestern portion--wild countries abounding in buffalo--were granted to\r\nthe Western Pawnees, the Arickarees, Arapahoes, Cheyennes, Kiowas,\r\nComanches, Utahs, Grosventres, and other nomads.\r\n\r\nIt was somewhat a confusion of races. For instance, the Pawnees form\r\nan independent family, to which some authors join the Arickaree; the\r\nSacs (Sauk) and Foxes, Winnebagoes, Ottoes, Kaws, Omahas, Cheyennes,\r\nMississippi Dakotahs, and Missouri Dakotahs, belong to the Dakotan\r\nfamily; the Choctaws, Creeks, and Seminoles are Appalachians; the\r\nWyandottes, like the Iroquois, are Hodesaunians; and the Ottawas,\r\nDelawares, Shawnees, Potawotomies, Peorians, Mohekuneuks, Kaskaskias,\r\nPiankeshaws, Weaws, Miamis, Kickapoos, and the Menomenes, are, like the\r\nOjibwas, Algonquins.\r\n\r\nThe total number of Indians on the prairies and the Rocky Mountains was\r\nestimated roughly at 63,000.\r\n\r\n[THE INDIAN TERRITORY.]\r\n\r\nStill the resistless tide of emigration swept westward: the federal\r\ngovernment was as powerless to stem it as was General Fitzroy of New\r\nSouth Wales to prevent, in 1852, his subjects flocking to the “gold\r\ndiggings.” Despite all orders, reckless whites would squat upon, and\r\nthoughtless reds, bribed by whisky, tobacco, and gunpowder, would sell\r\noff the lands. On the 20th of May, 1854, was passed the celebrated\r\n“Kansas-Nebraska Bill,” an act converting the greater portion of the\r\n“Indian Territory,” and all the “Northwestern Territory,” into two new\r\nterritories--Kansas, north of the 37th parallel, and Nebraska, north\r\nof the 40th. In the passage of this bill, the celebrated “Missouri\r\nCompromise” of 1828, prohibiting negro slavery north of 36° 30′, was\r\nrepealed, under the presidency of General Pierce.[26] It provided\r\nthat the rights and properties of the Indians, within their shrunken\r\npossessions, should be respected. By degrees the Indians sold their\r\nlands for whisky, as of old, and retired to smaller reservations.\r\nOf course, they suffered in the bargain; the savage ever parts with\r\nhis birthright for the well-known mess of pottage. The Osages, for\r\ninstance, canceled $4000, claimed by unscrupulous traders, by a\r\ncession of two million acres of arable land. The Potawotomies fared\r\neven worse; under the influence of liquor, ὡς λεγουσι, their chiefs\r\nsold 100,000 acres of the best soil on the banks of the Missouri for\r\na mere song. The tribe was removed to a bald smooth prairie, sans\r\ntimber and consequently sans game; many fled to the extreme wilds,\r\nand the others, like the Acadians of yore, were marched about till\r\nthey found homes--many of them six feet by two--in Fever Patch, on the\r\nKaw or Kansas River. Others were more fortunate. The Ottoes, Omahas,\r\nand Kansas had permanent villages near the Missouri and its two\r\ntributaries, the Platte and the Kansas. The Osages, formerly a large\r\nnation in Arkansas, after ceding 10,000,000 of acres for a stipend of\r\n$52,000 for thirty years, were settled in a district on the west bank\r\nof the Neosho or Whitewater--the Grand River. They are described as\r\nthe finest and largest men of the semi-nomad races, with well-formed\r\nheads and symmetrical figures, brave, warlike, and well disposed to\r\nthe whites. Early in June, after planting their maize, they move in\r\nmounted bands to the prairies, feast upon the buffalo for months, and\r\nbring home stores of smoked and jerked meat. When the corn is in milk\r\nthey husk and sundry it; it is then boiled, and is said to be better\r\nflavored and more nutritious than the East Indian “butah” or the\r\nAmerican hominy. After the harvest in October they return to the game\r\ncountry, and then pass the winter under huts or skin lodges. Their\r\nchief scourge is small-pox: apparently, all the tribes carry some\r\ncross. Of the settled races the best types are the Choctaws and the\r\nCherokees; the latter have shown a degree of improvability, which may\r\nstill preserve them from destruction; they have a form of government,\r\nchurches, theatres, and schools; they read and write English; and\r\nGeorge Guess, a well-known chief, like the negro inventor of the\r\nVai syllabarium in West Africa, produced an alphabet of sixty-eight\r\ncharacters, which, improved and simplified by the missionaries, is\r\nfound useful in teaching the vernacular.\r\n\r\n  [26] The “Missouri Compromise” is an important event in\r\n  Anglo-American history; it must be regarded as the great parent\r\n  of the jangles and heart-burnings which have disunited the United\r\n  States. The great Jefferson prophesied in these words: “the Missouri\r\n  question is a breaker on which we lose the Missouri country by\r\n  revolt, and what more God only knows. From the battle of Bunker’s\r\n  Hill to the treaty of Paris, we never had so ominous a question.”\r\n\r\n  The origin of the trouble was this. In 1817 the eastern half of\r\n  the Mississippi Territory became the Territory of Alabama, and--in\r\n  those days events had wings--the 14th of Dec., 1819, witnessed the\r\n  birth of Alabama as a free sovereign and independent slave state.\r\n  The South, strong in wealth and numbers, thereupon moved toward\r\n  legalizing slavery in the newly-acquired Territory of Missouri, and\r\n  when Missouri claimed to be admitted as a state, demanded that it\r\n  should be admitted as a slave state. The Free-soilers, or opposite\r\n  party, urged two reasons why Missouri should be a free state.\r\n  Firstly, since the date of the union eight new states had been\r\n  admitted, four slave and four free. Alabama, the last, was a slave\r\n  state, therefore it was the turn for a free state. Secondly--and here\r\n  was the rub--that “slavery ought not to be permitted in any state or\r\n  territory where it could be prohibited.” This very broad principle\r\n  involved, it is manifest, the ruin of the slave-ocracy. From the days\r\n  of Mr. Washington to those of Mr. Lincoln, the northern or labor\r\n  states have ever aimed at the ultimate abolition of servitude by\r\n  means of non-extension. The contest about Missouri began in 1818, and\r\n  raged for three years, complicated by a new feature, namely, Maine\r\n  separating herself from Massachusetts, and balancing the admission\r\n  of Alabama by becoming a free state. The Lower House several times\r\n  voted to exclude the “peculiar institution” from the new state, and\r\n  the conservative Senate--in which the Southern element was ever\r\n  predominant--as often restored it. Great was the war of words among\r\n  the rival legislators; at length, after repeated conferences, both\r\n  Senate and House agreed upon a bill admitting Missouri, after her\r\n  Constitution should be formed, free of restriction, but prohibiting\r\n  slavery north of 36° 30′. Missouri acknowledged the boon by adopting\r\n  a Constitution which denied the rights of citizens even to free\r\n  negroes. She was not finally admitted until the 10th of August, 1821,\r\n  when her Legislature had solemnly covenanted to guarantee the rights\r\n  of citizenship to “the citizens of either of the states.” Such is an\r\n  outline of the far-famed “Missouri Compromise.” The influence of the\r\n  Southern slaveholders caused it to be repealed, as a slip of Texas\r\n  happened to lie north of the prohibitative latitude, and the late Mr.\r\n  S. A. Douglas did it to death in 1854. The Free-soilers, of course,\r\n  fought hard against the “sad repeal,” and what they now fight about,\r\n  forty years afterward, is to run still farther south the original\r\n  line of limitation. _Hinc illæ lachrymæ!_\r\n\r\n[MISSIONARIES.]\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, however, the philanthropic schemes of the government\r\nhave not met with brilliant success. The chiefs are still bribed,\r\nand the people cheated by white traders, and poverty, disease, and\r\ndebauchery rapidly thin the tribesmen. Sensible heads have proposed\r\nmany schemes for preserving the race. Apparently the best of these\r\nprojects is to introduce the Moravian discipline. Of all missionary\r\nsystems, I may observe, none have hitherto been crowned with important\r\nresults, despite the blood and gold so profusely expended upon\r\nthem, except two--those of the Jesuits and the United Brethren. The\r\nfraternity of Jesus spread the Gospel by assimilating themselves to the\r\nheathen; the Unitas Fratrum by assimilating the heathen to themselves.\r\nThe day of Jesuitism, like that of protection, is going by. The\r\nadvance of Moravianism, it may safely be prophesied, is to come. These\r\ncivilization societies have as yet been little appreciated, because\r\nthey will not minister to that ignorant enthusiasm which extracts\r\nmoney from the pockets of the many. Their necessarily slow progress is\r\nirksome to ardent propagandists. We naturally wish to reap as well as\r\nto sow; and man rarely invests capital in schemes of which only his\r\ngrandson will see the results.\r\n\r\nThe American philanthropist proposes to wean the Indian savage\r\nfrom his nomad life by turning his lodge into a log tent, and by\r\nproviding him with cattle instead of buffalo, and the domestic fowl\r\ninstead of grasshoppers. The hunter become a herdsman would thus be\r\nstrengthened for another step--the agricultural life, which necessarily\r\nfollows the pastoral. Factors would be appointed instead of vicious\r\ntraders--_coureurs des bois_, as the Canadians call them; titles to\r\nland would be granted in fee-simple, practically teaching the value of\r\nproperty in severalty, alienation into white hands would be forbidden,\r\nand, if possible, a cordon militaire would be stretched between the\r\nraces. The agricultural would lead to the mechanical stage of society.\r\nAgents and assistant craftsmen would teach the tribes to raise mills\r\nand smithies (at present there are mills without millers, stock without\r\nbreeders, and similar attempts to make civilization run before she can\r\nwalk), and a growing appreciation for the peace, the comfort, and the\r\nluxuries of settled life would lay the nomad instinct forever.\r\n\r\nThe project labors only under one difficulty--the one common\r\nto philanthropic schemes. In many details it is somewhat\r\nvisionary--utopian. It is, like peace on earth, a “dream of the wise.”\r\nUnder the present system of Indian agencies, as will in a future page\r\nappear, it is simply impossible. It has terrible obstacles in the\r\nwestward gravitation of the white race, which, after sweeping away the\r\naborigines--as the gray rat in Europe expelled the black rat--from the\r\neast of the Mississippi in two centuries and a half, threatens, before\r\na quarter of that time shall have elapsed, to drive in its advance\r\ntoward the Pacific the few survivors of now populous tribes, either\r\ninto the inhospitable regions north of the 49th parallel, or into the\r\nanarchical countries south of the 32d. And where, I may ask, in the\r\nhistory of the world do we read of a people learning civilization from\r\nstrangers instead of working it out for themselves, through its several\r\ndegrees of barbarism, feudalism, monarchy, republicanism, despotism?\r\nStill it is a noble project; mankind would not willingly see it die.\r\n\r\n[THE PAWNEES.]\r\n\r\nThe Pawnees were called by the French and Canadian traders Les Loups,\r\nthat animal being their totem, and the sign of the tribe being an\r\nimitation of the wolf’s ears, the two fore fingers of the right\r\nhand being stuck up on the side of the head. They were in the last\r\ngeneration a large nation, containing many clans--Minnikajus, the Sans\r\nArc, the Loup Fork, and others. Their territory embraced both sides\r\nof the Platte River, especially the northern lands; and they rendered\r\nthese grounds terrible to the trapper, trader, and traveler. They were\r\nalways well mounted. Old Mexico was then, and partially is still,\r\ntheir stable, and a small band has driven off horses by hundreds.\r\nOf late years they have become powerless. The influenza acts as a\r\nplague among them, killing off 400 or 500 in a single season, and the\r\nnation now numbers little more than 300 braves, or rather warriors,\r\nthe latter, in correct parlance, being inferior to the former, as the\r\nformer are subservient to the chief. A treaty concluded between them\r\nand the United States in the winter of 1857 sent them to a reserve on\r\nthe Loup Fork, where their villages were destroyed by the Sioux. They\r\nare Ishmaelites, whose hand is against every man. They have attempted,\r\nafter the fashion of declining tribes, to strengthen themselves by\r\nalliances with their neighbors, but have always failed in consequence\r\nof their propensity to plunder developing itself even before the powwow\r\nwas concluded. They and the northern Dakotahs can never be trusted.\r\nMost Indian races, like the Bedouin Arabs, will show hospitality to the\r\nstranger who rides into their villages, though no point of honor deters\r\nthem from robbing him after he has left the lodge-shade. The Pawnees,\r\nAfrican-like, will cut the throat of a sleeping guest. They are easily\r\ndistinguished from their neighbors by the scalp-lock protruding from\r\na shaven head. After killing white men, they have insulted the corpse\r\nin a manner familiar to those who served in the Affghan war. They\r\nhave given up the practice of torturing prisoners, saying that the\r\n“Great Spirit,” or rather, as the expression should be translated,\r\nthe “Great Father” no longer wills it. The tradition is, that a few\r\nyears ago a squaw of a hostile tribe was snatched from the stake by\r\na white trader, and the action was interpreted as a decree of heaven.\r\nIt is probably a corruption of the well-known story of the rescue of\r\nthe Itean woman by Petalesharoo, the son of the “Knife Chief.” Like\r\nthe Southern and Western Indians generally, as is truly remarked by\r\nCaptain Mayne Reid,[27] “They possess more of that cold continence\r\nand chivalrous delicacy than characterize the Red Men of the forest.”\r\nThey are too treacherous to be used as soldiers. Like most pedestrian\r\nIndians, their arms and bodies are light and thin, and their legs are\r\nmuscular and well developed. They are great in endurance. I have heard\r\nof a Pawnee, who, when thoroughly “stampeded” by his enemies, “loped”\r\nfrom Fort Laramie to Kearney--300 miles--making the distance as fast as\r\nthe mail. This bad tribe is ever at war with their hereditary enemies\r\nthe Sioux. They do not extend westward of Fort Kearney. The principal\r\nsub-tribe is the Arickaree, or Ree, called Pedani by the Dakotah, who\r\nattacked and conquered them. Their large villages, near the mouth of\r\nthe Grand River, were destroyed by the expedition sent in 1825-26,\r\nunder Colonel Leavenworth, to chastise the attack upon the trading\r\nparty of General Ashley.\r\n\r\n  [27] The Scalp-hunters, chap. xlii.\r\n\r\n[THE DELAWARES.]\r\n\r\nA more interesting people than the Pawnee is the Delaware, whose oldest\r\ntradition derives him from the region west of the Mississippi. Thence\r\nthe tribe migrated to the Atlantic shores, where they took the title\r\nof Lenne Lenape, or men, and the neighboring races in respect called\r\nthem “uncle.” William Penn and his followers found this remnant of the\r\ngreat Algonquin confederacy in a depressed state: subjugated by the\r\nFive Nations, they had been compelled to take the name of “Iroquois\r\nSquaws.” In those days they felt an awe of the white man, and looked\r\nupon him as a something godlike. Since their return to the West their\r\nspirit has revived, their war-path has reached through Utah to the\r\nPacific Ocean, to Hudson’s Bay on the north, and southward to the heart\r\nof Mexico. Their present abodes are principally near Fort Leavenworth\r\nupon the Missouri, and in the Choctaw territory near Fort Arbuckle,\r\nupon the eastern Colorado or Canadian River. They are familiar with the\r\nlanguages, manners, and customs of their pale-faced neighbors; they are\r\nso feared as rifle shots that a host of enemies will fly from a few of\r\ntheir warriors, and they mostly lead a vagrant life, the wandering Jews\r\nof the West, as traders, hunters, and trappers, among the other Indian\r\ntribes. For 185 years the Shawnees have been associated with them in\r\nintermarriage, yet they are declining in numbers; here and there some\r\nare lost, one by one, in travel or battle; they have now dwindled to\r\nabout a hundred warriors, and the extinction of the tribe appears\r\nimminent. As hunters and guides, they are preferred to all others by\r\nthe whites, and it is believed that they would make as formidable\r\npartisan soldiers as any on this continent. When the government of the\r\nUnited States, after the fashion of France and England, begins to raise\r\n“Irregular Native Corps,” the loss of the Delawares will be regretted.\r\n\r\nChanging mules at Kiowa about 10 A.M., we pushed forward through the\r\nsun, which presently was mitigated by heavy nimbi, to Liberty Farm,\r\nwhere a station supplied us with the eternal eggs and bacon of these\r\n_mangeurs de lard_. It is a dish constant in the great West, as the\r\nomelet and pigeon in the vetturini days of Italy, when, prompted by the\r\ninstincts of self-preservation, the inmates of the dove-cot, unless\r\nprevented in time, are said to have fled their homes at the sight of\r\nMilordo’s traveling carriage, not to return until the portent had\r\ndisappeared. The Little Blue ran hard by, about fifty feet wide by\r\nthree or four deep, fringed with emerald-green oak groves, cotton-wood,\r\nand long-leaved willow: its waters supply catfish, suckers, and a\r\nsoft-shelled turtle, but the fish are full of bones, and taste, as\r\nmight be imagined, much like mud. The country showed vestiges of\r\nanimal life, the prairie bore signs of hare and antelope; in the\r\nvalley, coyotes, wolves, and foxes, attracted by the carcasses of\r\ncattle, stared us in the face, and near the stream, plovers, jays,\r\nthe bluebird (sialia), and a kind of starling, called the swamp or\r\nredwinged blackbird, twittered a song of satisfaction. We then resumed\r\nour journey over a desert, waterless save after rain, for twenty-three\r\nmiles; it is the divide between the Little Blue and the Platte rivers,\r\na broken table-land rising gradually toward the west, with, at this\r\nseason, a barren soil of sand and clay. As the evening approached, a\r\nsmile from above lit up into absolute beauty the homely features of\r\nthe world below. The sweet commune with nature in her fairest hours\r\ndenied to the sons of cities--who must contemplate her charms through\r\na vista of brick wall, or over a foreground of chimney-pots--consoled\r\nus amply for all the little hardships of travel. Strata upon strata of\r\ncloud-banks, burnished to golden red in the vicinity of the setting\r\nsun, and polished to dazzling silvery white above, lay piled half\r\nway from the horizon to the zenith, with a distinct strike toward a\r\nvanishing point in the west, and dipping into a gateway through which\r\nthe orb of day slowly retired. Overhead floated in a sea of amber and\r\nyellow, pink and green, heavy purple nimbi, apparently turned upside\r\ndown--their convex bulges below, and their horizontal lines high in the\r\nair--while in the east black and blue were so curiously blended that\r\nthe eye could not distinguish whether it rested upon darkening air or\r\nupon a lowering thunder-cloud. We enjoyed these beauties in silence;\r\nnot a soul said, “Look there!” or “How pretty!”\r\n\r\nAt 9 P.M., reaching “Thirty-two-mile Creek,” we were pleasantly\r\nsurprised to find an utter absence of the Irishry. The station-master\r\nwas the head of a neat-handed and thrifty family from Vermont; the\r\nrooms, such as they were, looked cosy and clean--and the chickens\r\nand peaches were plump and well “fixed.” Soldiers from Fort Kearney\r\nloitered about the adjoining store, and from them we heard past\r\nfights and rumors of future wars which were confirmed on the morrow.\r\nRemounting at 10 30 P.M., and before moonrise, we threaded the gloom\r\nwithout other accident than the loss of a mule that was being led to\r\nthe next station. The amiable animal, after breaking loose, coquetted\r\nwith its pursuers for a while, according to the fashion of its kind,\r\nand when the cerne or surround was judged complete, it dashed through\r\nthe circle and gave leg-bail, its hoofs ringing over the stones till\r\nthe sound died away in the distant shades.\r\n\r\n  _The Platte River and Fort Kearney, August 10._\r\n\r\n[LA GRANDE PLATTE.]\r\n\r\nAfter a long and chilly night--extensive evaporation making 40° F. feel\r\nexcessively cold--lengthened by the atrocity of the musquetoes, which\r\nsting even when the thermometer stands below 45°, we awoke upon the\r\nhill sands divided by two miles of level green savanna, and at 4 A.M.\r\nreached Kearney Station, in the valley of La Grande Platte, seven miles\r\nfrom the fort of that name. The first aspect of the stream was one of\r\ncalm and quiet beauty, which, however, it owed much to its accessories:\r\nsome travelers have not hesitated to characterize it as “the dreariest\r\nof rivers.” On the south is a rolling range of red sandy and clayey\r\nhillocks, sharp toward the river--the “coasts of the Nebraska.” The\r\nvalley, here two miles broad, resembles the ocean deltas of great\r\nstreams; it is level as a carpet, all short green grass without sage\r\nor bush. It can hardly be called a bottom, the rise from the water’s\r\nedge being, it is calculated, about 4 feet per 1000. Under a bank, from\r\nhalf a yard to a yard high, through its two lawns of verdure, flowed\r\nthe stream straight toward the slanting rays of the rising sun, which\r\nglittered upon its broad bosom, and shed rosy light over half the\r\nheavens. In places it shows a sea horizon, but here it was narrowed by\r\nGrand Island, which is fifty-two miles long, with an average breadth of\r\none mile and three quarters, and sufficiently elevated above the annual\r\nflood to be well timbered.\r\n\r\nWithout excepting even the Missouri, the Platte is doubtless the most\r\nimportant western influent of the Mississippi. Its valley offers\r\na route scarcely to be surpassed for natural gradients, requiring\r\nlittle beyond the superstructure for light trains; and by following\r\nup its tributary--the Sweetwater--the engineer finds a line laid down\r\nby nature to the foot of the South Pass of the Rocky Mountains, the\r\ndividing ridge between the Atlantic and the Pacific water-beds. At\r\npresent the traveler can cross the 300 or 400 miles of desert between\r\nthe settlements in the east and the populated parts of the western\r\nmountains by its broad highway, with never-failing supplies of water,\r\nand, in places, fuel. Its banks will shortly supply coal to take the\r\nplace of the timber that has thinned out.\r\n\r\nThe Canadian voyageurs first named it La Platte, the Flat River,\r\ndiscarding, or rather translating after their fashion, the musical\r\nand picturesque aboriginal term, “Nebraska,” the “shallow stream:”\r\nthe word has happily been retained for the Territory. Springing\r\nfrom the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains, it has, like all the\r\nvalley streams westward of the Mississippi, the Niobrara, or Eau qui\r\ncourt,[28] the Arkansas, and the Canadian River, a declination to\r\nthe southeast. From its mouth to the junction of its northern and\r\nsouthern forks, the river valley is mostly level, and the scenery is\r\nof remarkable sameness: its singularity in this point affects the\r\nmemory. There is not a tributary, not a ravine, in places not a tree to\r\ndistract attention from the grassy intermediate bottom, which, plain as\r\na prairie, extends from four to five and even twelve miles in width,\r\nbounded on both sides by low, rolling, sandy hills, thinly vegetated,\r\nand in few places showing dwarf bluffs. Between the forks and Fort\r\nLaramie the ground is more accented, the land near its banks often\r\nbecomes precipitous, the road must sometimes traverse the tongues and\r\nridges which project into the valley, and in parts the path is deep\r\nwith sand. The stream averages about a mile in breadth, and sometimes\r\nwidens out into the semblance of an estuary, flowing in eddies where\r\nholes are, and broken by far-reaching sand-bars and curlew shallows.\r\nIn places it is a labyrinth of islets, variously shaped and of all\r\nsizes, from the long tongue which forms a vista to the little bouquet\r\nof cool verdure, grass, young willows, and rose-bushes. The shallowness\r\nof the bed causes the water to be warm in summer; a great contrast\r\nto the clear, cool springs on its banks. The sole is treacherous in\r\nthe extreme, full of quicksands and gravel shoals, channels and cuts,\r\nwhich shift, like those of the Indus, with each year’s flood; the site\r\nbeing nearly level, the river easily swells, and the banks, here of\r\nlight, there of dark colored silt, based, like the floor, on sand,\r\nare, though vertical, rarely more than two feet high. It is a river\r\nwillfully wasted by nature. The inundation raises it to about six feet\r\nthroughout: this freshet, however, is of short duration, and the great\r\nbreadth of the river causes a want of depth which renders it unfit\r\nfor the navigation of a craft more civilized than the Indian’s birch\r\nor the Canadian fur-boat. Colonel Frémont failed to descend it in\r\nSeptember with a boat drawing only four inches. The water, like that of\r\nthe Missouri, and for the same reason, is surcharged with mud drained\r\nfrom the prairies; carried from afar, it has usually a dark tinge;\r\nit is remarkably opaque after floods; if a few inches deep, it looks\r\nbottomless, and, finally, it contains little worth fishing for. From\r\nthe mouth to Fort Kearney, beyond which point timber is rare, one bank,\r\nand one only, is fringed with narrow lines of well-grown cotton-wood,\r\nred willows, and cedars, which are disappearing before the emigrant’s\r\naxe. The cedar now becomes an important tree. It will not grow on the\r\nplains, owing to the dryness of the climate and the excessive cold;\r\neven in the sheltered ravines the wintry winds have power to blight\r\nall the tops that rise above prairie level, and where the locality is\r\nbetter adapted for plantations, firs prevail. An interesting effect of\r\nclimate upon the cedar is quoted by travelers on the Missouri River. At\r\nthe first Cedar Island (43° N. lat.) large and straight trees appear in\r\nthe bottom lands, those on the bluffs being of inferior growth; higher\r\nup the stream they diminish, seldom being seen in any number together\r\nabove the mouth of the Little Cheyenne (45° N. lat.), and there they\r\nare exceedingly crooked and twisted. In the lignite formations above\r\nthe Missouri and the Yellow Stone, the cedar, unable to support itself\r\nabove ground, spreads over the hill-sides and presents the appearance\r\nof grass or moss.\r\n\r\n  [28] For an accurate geographical description of this little-known\r\n  river, the reader is referred to Lieutenant Warren’s report,\r\n  published by the Secretary of War, United States.\r\n\r\n[THE WILD GARDEN.]\r\n\r\nBeyond the immediate banks of the Platte the soil is either sandy,\r\nquickly absorbing water, or it is a hard, cold, unwholesome clay,\r\nwhich long retains muddy pools, black with decayed vegetation, and\r\nwhich often, in the lowest levels, becomes a mere marsh. The wells\r\nderiving infiltration from the higher lands beyond are rarely more than\r\nthree feet deep; the produce is somewhat saline, and here and there\r\nsalt may be seen efflorescing from the soil around them. In the large\r\nbeds of prêle (an equisetum), scouring rush, and other aquatic plants\r\nwhich garnish the banks, myriads of musquetoes find a home. Flowers\r\nof rich, warm color appear, we remark, in the sandy parts: the common\r\nwild helianthus and a miniature sunflower like chamomile, a thistle\r\n(_Carduus leucographus_), the cactus, a peculiar milk-plant (_Asclepias\r\nsyrivea_), a spurgewort (_Asclepias tuberosa_), the amorpha, the\r\ntradescantia, the putoria, and the artemisia, or prairie sage. The\r\nricher soils and ravines produce in abundance the purple aster--violet\r\nof these regions--a green plant, locally known as “Lamb’s Quarters,” a\r\npurple flower with bulbous root, wild flax with pretty blue blossoms,\r\nbesides mallow, digitalis, anemone, streptanthis, and a honeysuckle. In\r\nparts the valley of the Platte is a perfect parterre of wild flowers.\r\n\r\nAfter satisfying hunger with vile bread and viler coffee--how far from\r\nthe little forty-berry cup of Egypt!--for which we paid 75 cents, we\r\nleft Kearney Station without delay. Hugging the right bank of our\r\nstrange river, at 8 A.M. we found ourselves at Fort Kearney, so called,\r\nas is the custom, after the gallant officer, now deceased, of that name.\r\n\r\nEvery square box or block-house in these regions is a fort; no\r\nmisnomer, however, can be more complete than the word applied to the\r\nmilitary cantonments on the frontier. In former times the traders to\r\nwhom these places mostly belonged erected quadrangles of sun-dried\r\nbrick with towers at the angles; their forts still appear in old books\r\nof travels: the War Department, however, has been sensible enough to\r\nremove them. The position usually chosen is a river bottom, where\r\nfuel, grass, and water are readily procurable. The quarters are of\r\nvarious styles; some, with their low verandas, resemble Anglo-Indian\r\nbungalows or comfortable farm-houses; others are the storied houses,\r\nwith the “stoop” or porch of the Eastern States in front; and low,\r\nlong, peat-roofed tenements are used for magazines and out-houses. The\r\nbest material is brown adobe or unburnt brick; others are of timber,\r\nwhitewashed and clean-looking, with shingle roofs, glass windows, and\r\ngay green frames--that contrast of colors which the New Englander\r\nloves. The habitations surround a cleared central space for parade and\r\ndrill; the ground is denoted by the tall flag-staff, which does not, as\r\nin English camps, distinguish the quarters of the commanding officer.\r\nOne side is occupied by the officers’ bungalows, the other, generally\r\nthat opposite, by the adjutant’s and quartermaster’s offices, and the\r\nsquare is completed by low ranges of barrack and commissariat stores,\r\nwhile various little shops, stables, corrals for cattle, a chapel,\r\nperhaps an artillery park, and surely an ice-house--in this point India\r\nis far behind the wilds of America--complete the settlement. Had these\r\ncantonments a few more trees and a far more brilliant verdure, they\r\nwould suggest the idea of an out-station in Guzerat, the Deccan, or\r\nsome similar Botany Bay for decayed gentlemen who transport themselves.\r\n\r\n[INDIAN FIGHTING.]\r\n\r\nWhile at Washington I had resolved--as has already been\r\nintimated--when the reports of war in the West were waxing loud,\r\nto enjoy a little Indian fighting. The meritorious intention--for\r\nwhich the severest “wig,” concluding with something personally\r\noffensive about volunteering in general, would have been its sole\r\nresult in the “fast-anchored isle”--was most courteously received\r\nby the Hon. John B. Floyd, Secretary of War, who provided me with\r\nintroductory letters addressed to the officers commanding various\r\n“departments”[29]--“divisions,” as they would be called by\r\nEnglishmen--in the West. The first tidings that saluted my ears on\r\narrival at Fort Kearney acted as a quietus: an Indian action had been\r\nfought, which signified that there would be no more fighting for some\r\ntime. Captain Sturgis, of the 1st Cavalry, U. S., had just attacked,\r\nnear the Republican Fork of Kansas River, a little south of the fort,\r\nwith six companies (about 350 men) and a few Delawares, a considerable\r\nbody of the enemy, Comanches, Kiowas, and Cheyennes, who apparently\r\nhad forgotten the severe lesson administered to them by Colonel--now\r\nBrigadier General--Edwin V. Sumner, 1st Cavalry, in 1857, and killed\r\ntwenty-five with only two or three of his own men wounded. According\r\nto details gathered at Fort Kearney, the Indians had advanced under\r\na black flag, lost courage, as wild men mostly will, when they heard\r\nthe _pas de charge_, and, after making a running fight, being well\r\nmounted as well as armed, had carried off their “cripples” lashed to\r\ntheir horses. I had no time to call upon Captain Sully, who remained in\r\ncommand at Kearney with two troops (here called companies) of dragoons,\r\nor heavy cavalry, and one of infantry; the mail-wagon would halt there\r\nbut a few minutes. I therefore hurriedly chose the alternative of\r\nadvancing, with the hope of seeing “independent service” on the road.\r\nIntelligence of the fight had made even the conductor look grave; fifty\r\nor sixty miles is a flea-bite to a mounted war-party, and disappointed\r\nIndians upon the war-path are especially dangerous--even the most\r\nfriendly can not be trusted when they have lost, or have not succeeded\r\nin taking, a few scalps. We subsequently heard that they had crossed\r\nour path, but whether the tale was true or not is an essentially\r\ndoubtful matter. If this chance failed, remained the excitement of the\r\nbuffalo and the Mormon; both were likely to show better sport than\r\ncould be found in riding wildly about the country after runaway braves.\r\n\r\n  [29] The following is a list of the military departments into which\r\n  the United States are divided:\r\n\r\n  MILITARY COMMANDS.\r\n\r\n  _Department of the East._--The country east of the Mississippi River;\r\n  head-quarters at Troy, N. Y.\r\n\r\n  _Department of the West._--The country west of the Mississippi River,\r\n  and east of the Rocky Mountains, except that portion included within\r\n  the limits of the departments of Texas and New Mexico; head-quarters\r\n  at St. Louis, Mo.\r\n\r\n  _Department of Texas._--The State of Texas, and the territory north\r\n  of it to the boundaries of New Mexico, Kansas, and Arkansas, and\r\n  the Arkansas River, including Fort Smith. Fort Bliss, in Texas, is\r\n  temporarily attached to the department of New Mexico; head-quarters\r\n  at San Antonio, Texas.\r\n\r\n  _Department of New Mexico._--The Territory of New Mexico;\r\n  head-quarters at Santa Fé, New Mexico.\r\n\r\n  _Department of Utah._--The Territory of Utah, except that portion of\r\n  it lying west of the 117th degree of west longitude; head-quarters,\r\n  Camp Floyd, U. T.\r\n\r\n  _Department of the Pacific._--The country west of the Rocky\r\n  Mountains, except those portions of it included within the limits of\r\n  the departments of Utah and New Mexico, and the district of Oregon;\r\n  head-quarters at San Francisco, California.\r\n\r\n  _District of Oregon._--The Territory of Washington and the State of\r\n  Oregon, excepting the Rogue River and Umpqua districts in Oregon;\r\n  head-quarters at Fort Vancouver, Washington Territory.\r\n\r\n[OUTPOST SYSTEMS.]\r\n\r\nWe all prepared for the “gravity of the situation” by discharging\r\nand reloading our weapons, and bade adieu, about 9 30 A.M., to Fort\r\nKearney. Before dismissing the subject of forts, I am disposed to make\r\nsome invidious remarks upon the army system of outposts in America.\r\n\r\nThe War Department of the United States has maintained the same\r\nsystem which the British, much to their loss--I need scarcely trouble\r\nthe reader with a list of evils done to the soldier by outpost\r\nduty--adopted and pertinaciously kept up for so long a time in India;\r\nnay, even maintain to the present day, despite the imminent danger of\r\nmutiny. With the Anglo-Scandinavian race, the hate of centralization\r\nin civil policy extends to military organization, of which it should\r\nbe the vital principle. The French, gifted with instinct for war,\r\nand being troubled with scant prejudice against concentration, civil\r\nas well as military, soon abandoned, when they found its futility,\r\nthe idea of defending their Algerian frontier by extended lines,\r\nblock-houses, and feeble intrenched posts. They wisely established, at\r\nthe centres of action, depôts, magazines, and all the requisites for\r\nsupporting large bodies of men, making them pivots for expeditionary\r\ncolumns, which by good military roads could be thrown in overwhelming\r\nnumbers, in the best health and in the highest discipline, wherever an\r\nattack or an insurrectionary movement required crushing.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of so doing has long occurred to the American government,\r\nin whose service at present “a regiment is stationed to-day on the\r\nborders of tropical Mexico; to-morrow, the war-whoop, borne on a gale\r\nfrom the northwest, compels its presence to the frozen latitudes\r\nof Puget’s Sound.” The objections to altering their present highly\r\nobjectionable system are two: the first is a civil consideration, the\r\nsecond a military one.\r\n\r\nAs I have remarked about the centralization of troops, so it is with\r\ntheir relation to civilians; the Anglo-Scandinavian blood shows\r\nsimilar manifestations in the Old and in the New Country. The French,\r\na purely military nation, pet their army, raise it to the highest\r\npitch, send it in for glory, and when it fails are to its faults a\r\nlittle blind. The English and Anglo-Americans, essentially a commercial\r\nand naval people, dislike the red coat; they look upon, and from the\r\nfirst they looked upon, a standing army as a necessary nuisance; they\r\never listen open-eared to projects for cutting and curtailing army\r\nexpenditure; and when they have weakened their forces by a manner of\r\natrophy, they expect them to do more than their duty, and if they can\r\nnot command success, abuse them. With a commissariat, transport, and\r\nhospitals--delicate pieces of machinery, which can not run smoothly\r\nwhen roughly and hurriedly put together--unaccustomed to and unprepared\r\nfor service, they land an army 3000 miles from home, and then make\r\nthe world ring with their disappointment, and their complainings\r\nanent fearful losses in men and money. The fact is that, though no\r\nsoldiers in the world fight with more bravery and determination, the\r\nAnglo-Scandinavian race, with their present institutions, are inferior\r\nto their inferiors in other points, as regards the art of military\r\norganization. Their fatal wants are order and economy, combined with\r\nthe will and the means of selecting the best men--these belong to the\r\nemperor, not to the constitutional king or the president--and most of\r\nall, the habit of implicit subjection to the commands of an absolute\r\ndictator. The end of this long preamble is that the American government\r\napparently thinks less of the efficiency of its troops than of using\r\nthem as escorts to squatters, as police of the highway. Withal they\r\nfail; emigrants will not be escorted; women and children will struggle\r\nwhen they please, even, in an Indian country, and every season has its\r\ndreadful tales of violence and starvation, massacre and cannibalism.\r\nIn France the emigrants would be ordered to collect in bodies at\r\ncertain seasons, to report their readiness for the road to the officers\r\ncommanding stations, to receive an escort, as he should deem proper,\r\nand to disobey at their peril.\r\n\r\nThe other motive of the American outpost system is military, but also\r\nof civilian origin. Concentration would necessarily be unpalatable\r\nto a number of senior officers, who now draw what in England would\r\nbe called command allowances at the several stations.[30] One of\r\nthe principles of a republic is to pay a man only while he works;\r\npensions, like sinecures, are left to governments less disinterested.\r\nThe American army--it would hardly be believed--has no pensions, sale\r\nof commissions, off-reckonings, nor retiring list. A man hopelessly\r\ninvalided, or in his second childhood, must hang on by means of\r\nfurloughs and medical certificates to the end. The colonels are\r\nmostly upon the sick-list--one died lately aged ninety-three, and\r\ndating from the days of Louis XVI.--and I heard of an officer who,\r\nthough practicing medicine for years, was still retained upon the\r\ncadre of his regiment. Of course, the necessity of changing such an\r\nanomaly has frequently been mooted by the Legislature; the scandalous\r\nfailure, however, of an attempt at introducing a pension-list into the\r\nUnited States Navy so shocked the public that no one will hear of the\r\nexperiment being renewed, even _in corpore vili_, the army.\r\n\r\n  [30] The aggregate of the little regular army of the United States in\r\n  1860 amounted to 18,093. It was dispersed into eighty military posts,\r\n  viz., thirteen in the Department of the East, nine in the West,\r\n  twenty in Texas, twelve in the Department of New Mexico, two in Utah\r\n  (Fort Bridger and Camp Floyd), eleven in Oregon, and thirteen in the\r\n  Department of California. They each would have an average of about\r\n  225 men.\r\n\r\nTo conclude the subject of outpost system. If the change be advisable\r\nin the United States, it is positively necessary to the British in\r\nIndia. The peninsula presents three main points, not to mention the\r\ndetached heights that are found in every province, as the great\r\npivots of action, the Himalayas, the Deccan, and the Nilgherry Hills,\r\nwhere, until wanted, the Sepoy and his officer, as well as the white\r\nsoldier--the latter worth £100 a head--can be kept in health, drilled,\r\ndisciplined, and taught the hundred arts which render an “old salt”\r\nthe most handy of men. A few years ago the English soldier was fond\r\nof Indian service; hardly a regiment returned home without leaving\r\nhundreds behind it. Now, long, fatiguing marches, scant fare, the worst\r\naccommodation, and the various results of similar hardships, make him\r\nlook upon the land as a Golgotha; it is with difficulty that he can be\r\nprevented from showing his disgust. Both in India and America, this\r\nwill be the great benefit of extensive railroads: they will do away\r\nwith single stations, and enable the authorities to carry out a system\r\nof concentration most beneficial to the country and to the service,\r\nwhich, after many years of sore drudgery, may at last discern the good\r\ntime coming.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, two other measures appear called for by\r\ncircumstances. The Indian race is becoming desperate, wild-beast like,\r\nhemmed in by its enemies that have flanked it on the east and west, and\r\nare gradually closing in upon it. The tribes can no longer shift ground\r\nwithout inroads into territories already occupied by neighbors, who\r\nare, of course, hostile; they are, therefore, being brought to final\r\nbay.\r\n\r\n[THE CAMEL CORPS.]\r\n\r\nThe first is a camel corps. At present, when disturbances on a\r\nlarge scale occur in the Far West--the spring of 1862 will probably\r\nsee them--a force of cavalry must be sent from the East, perhaps\r\nalso infantry. “The horses, after a march of 500 or 600 miles, are\r\nexpected to act with success”--I quote the sensible remarks of a\r\n“late captain of infantry” (Captain Patterson, U. S. Army)--“against\r\nscattered bands of mounted hunters, with the speed of a horse and the\r\nwatchfulness of a wolf or antelope, whose faculties are sharpened by\r\ntheir necessities; who, when they get short of provisions, separate and\r\nlook for something to eat, and find it in the water, in the ground,\r\nor on the surface; whose bill of fare ranges from grass-seed, nuts,\r\nroots, grasshoppers, lizards, and rattlesnakes, up to the antelope,\r\ndeer, elk, bear, and buffalo, and who, having a continent to roam over,\r\nwill neither be surprised, caught, conquered, overawed, or reduced\r\nto famine by a rumbling, bugle-blowing, drum-beating town passing\r\nthrough their country on wheels, at the speed of a loaded wagon.” But\r\nthe camel would in these latitudes easily march sixty miles per diem\r\nfor a week or ten days, amply sufficient to tire out the sturdiest\r\nIndian pony; it requires water only after every fifty hours, and the\r\nworst soil would supply it with ample forage in the shape of wild\r\nsage, rabbit-bush, and thorns. Each animal would carry two men, with\r\ntheir arms and ammunition, rations for the time required, bedding and\r\nregimental necessaries, with material to make up a _tente d’abri_ if\r\njudged necessary. The organization should be that of the Sindh Camel\r\nCorps, which, under Sir Charles Napier, was found so efficient against\r\nthe frontier Beloch. The best men for this kind of fighting would\r\nbe the Mountaineers, or Western Men, of the caste called “Pikes;”\r\nproperly speaking, Missourians, but popularly any “rough” between\r\nSt. Louis and California. After a sound flogging, for the purpose of\r\npreparing their minds to admit the fact that all men are _not_ equal,\r\nthey might be used by sea or land, whenever hard, downright fighting\r\nis required. It is understood that hitherto the camel, despite the\r\ncareful selection by Mr. De Leon, the excellent Consul General of the\r\nUnited States in Egypt, and the valuable instructions of Hekekyan Bey,\r\nhas proved a failure in the Western world. If so, want of patience has\r\nbeen the sole cause; the animal must be acclimatized by slow degrees\r\nbefore heavy loading to test its powers of strength and speed. Some\r\nmay deem this amount of delay impossible. I confess my belief that the\r\nAnglo-Americans can, within any but the extremest limits, accomplish\r\nany thing they please--except unity.\r\n\r\nThe other necessity will be the raising of native regiments. The French\r\nin Africa have their Spahis, the Russians their Cossacks, and the\r\nEnglish their Sepoys. The American government has often been compelled,\r\nas in the case of the Creek battalion, which did good service during\r\nthe Seminole campaign, indirectly to use their wild aborigines; but\r\nthe public sentiment, or rather prejudice, which fathers upon the\r\nmodern Pawnee the burning and torturing tastes of the ancient Mohawk,\r\nis strongly opposed to pitting Indian against Indian in battle. Surely\r\nthis is a false as well as a mistaken philanthropy. If war must be,\r\nit is better that Indian instead of white blood should be shed. And\r\ninvariably the effect of enlisting savages and barbarians, subjecting\r\nthem to discipline, and placing them directly under the eye of the\r\ncivilized man, has been found to diminish their ferocity. The Bashi\r\nBuzuk, left to himself, roasted the unhappy Russian; in the British\r\nservice he brought his prisoner alive into camp with a view to a\r\npresent or promotion. When talking over the subject with the officers\r\nof the United States regular army, they have invariably concurred with\r\nme in the possibility of the scheme, provided that the public animus\r\ncould be turned pro instead of con; and I have no doubt but that they\r\nwill prove as leaders of Irregulars--it would be invidious to quote\r\nnames--equal to the best of the Anglo-Indians, Skinner, Beatson, and\r\nJacob. The men would receive about ten dollars per man, and each corps\r\nnumber 300. They would be better mounted and better armed than their\r\nwild brethren, and they might be kept, when not required for active\r\nservice, in a buffalo country, their favorite quarters, and their\r\nfinest field for soldierlike exercises. The main point to be avoided is\r\nthe mistake committed by the British in India, that of appointing too\r\nmany officers to their Sepoy corps.\r\n\r\nWe left Kearney at 9 30 A.M., following the road which runs forty\r\nmiles up the valley of the Platte. It is a broad prairie, plentifully\r\nsupplied with water in wells two to four feet deep; the fluid is cool\r\nand clear, but it is said not to be wholesome. Where the soil is clayey\r\npools abound; the sandy portions are of course dry. Along the southern\r\nbank near Kearney are few elevations; on the opposite or northern side\r\nappear high and wooded bluffs. The road was rough with pitch-holes, and\r\nfor the first time I remarked a peculiar gap in the ground like an East\r\nIndian sun-crack--in these latitudes you see none of the deep fissures\r\nwhich scar the face of mother earth in tropical lands--the effect of\r\nrain-streams and snow-water acting upon the clay. Each succeeding\r\nwinter lengthens the head and deepens the sole of this deeply-gashed\r\nwater-cut till it destroys the road. A curious mirage appeared,\r\ndoubling to four the strata of river and vegetation on the banks. The\r\nsight and song of birds once more charmed us after a desert where\r\nanimal life is as rare as upon the plains of Brazil. After fifteen\r\nmiles of tossing and tumbling, we made “Seventeen-mile Station,” and\r\nhalted there to change mules. About twenty miles above the fort the\r\nsouthern bank began to rise into mounds of tenacious clay, which, worn\r\naway into perpendicular and precipitous sections, composes the columnar\r\nformation called O’Fallon’s Bluffs. At 1 15 P.M. we reached Plum Creek,\r\nafter being obliged to leave behind one of the conductors, who had\r\nbecome delirious with the “shakes.” The establishment, though new, was\r\nalready divided into three; the little landlady, though she worked so\r\nmanfully, was, as she expressed it, “enjoying bad health;” in other\r\nwords, suffering from a “dumb chill.” I may observe that the Prairie\r\nTraveler’s opinions concerning the power of encamping with impunity\r\nupon the banks of the streams in this country must not be applied\r\nto the Platte. The whole line becomes with early autumn a hotbed of\r\nfebrile disease. And generally throughout this season the stranger\r\nshould not consider himself safe on any grounds save those defended\r\nfrom the southern trade-wind, which, sweeping directly from the Gulf of\r\nMexico, bears with it noxious exhalations.\r\n\r\nAbout Plum Ranch the soil is rich, clayey, and dotted with swamps and\r\n“slews,” by which the English traveler will understand sloughs. The\r\ndryer portions were a Gulistan of bright red, blue, and white flowers,\r\nthe purple aster, and the mallow, with its parsnip-like root, eaten by\r\nthe Indians, the gaudy yellow helianthus--we remarked at least three\r\nvarieties--the snowy mimulus, the graceful flax, sometimes four feet\r\nhigh, and a delicate little euphorbia, while in the damper ground\r\nappeared the polar plant, that prairie compass, the plane of whose leaf\r\never turns toward the magnetic meridian. This is the “weed-prairie,”\r\none of the many divisions of the great natural meadows; grass prairie,\r\nrolling prairie, motte prairie, salt prairie, and soda prairie. It\r\ndeserves a more poetical name, for\r\n\r\n    “These are the gardens of the desert, these\r\n    The unshorn fields, boundless and beautiful,\r\n    For which the speech of England has no name.”\r\n\r\nBuffalo herds were behind the hills, but we were too full of sleep to\r\nfollow them. The plain was dotted with blanched skulls and bones, which\r\nwould have made a splendid bonfire. Apparently the expert voyageur has\r\nnot learned that they form good fuel; at any rate, he has preferred\r\nto them the “chips” of which it is said that a steak cooked with them\r\nrequires no pepper.[31]\r\n\r\n  [31] The chip corresponds with the bois de vache of Switzerland, the\r\n  tezek of Armenia, the arghol of Thibet, and the gobar of India. With\r\n  all its faults, it is at least superior to that used in Sindh.\r\n\r\n[BUFFALO-BEEF.]\r\n\r\nWe dined at Plum Creek on buffalo, probably bull beef, the worst and\r\ndryest meat, save elk, that I have ever tasted; indeed, without the\r\nassistance of pork fat, we found it hard to swallow. As every one\r\nknows, however, the two-year old cow is the best eating, and at this\r\nseason the herds are ever in the worst condition. The animals calve in\r\nMay and June, consequently they are in August completely out of flesh.\r\nThey are fattest about Christmas, when they find it difficult to run.\r\nAll agree in declaring that there is no better meat than that of the\r\nyoung buffalo: the assertion, however, must be taken _cum grano salis_.\r\nWild flesh was never known to be equal to tame, and that monarch did at\r\nleast one wise thing who made the loin of beef Sir Loin. The voyageurs\r\nand travelers who cry up the buffalo as so delicious, have been living\r\nfor weeks on rusty bacon and lean antelope; a rich hump with its proper\r\nmenstruum, a cup of _café noir_ as strong as possible, must truly be a\r\n“tit-bit.” They boast that the fat does not disagree with the eater;\r\nneither do three pounds of heavy pork with the English plow-boy, who\r\nhas probably taken less exercise than the Canadian hunter. Before long,\r\nbuffalo flesh will reach New York, where I predict it will be held as\r\ninferior to butcher’s meat as is the antelope to park-fed venison.\r\nWhile hunting, Indians cut off the tail to test the quality of the\r\ngame, and they have acquired by habit a power of judging on the run\r\nbetween fat and lean.\r\n\r\nResuming our weary ride, we watered at “Willow Island Ranch,” and then\r\nat “Cold Water Ranch”--drinking-shops all--five miles from Midway\r\nStation, which we reached at 8 P.M. Here, while changing mules, we\r\nattempted with sweet speech and smiles to persuade the landlady, who\r\nshowed symptoms of approaching maternity, into giving us supper. This\r\nshe sturdily refused to do, for the reason that she had not received\r\ndue warning. We had, however, the satisfaction of seeing the _employés_\r\nof the line making themselves thoroughly comfortable with bread and\r\nbuttermilk. Into the horrid wagon again, and “a rollin:” lazily enough\r\nthe cold and hungry night passed on.[32]\r\n\r\n  [32] According to Colonel Frémont, the total amount of buffalo robes\r\n  purchased by the several companies, American, Hudson’s Bay, and\r\n  others, was an annual total of 90,000 from the eight or ten years\r\n  preceding 1843. This is repeated by the Abbé Domenech, who adds\r\n  that the number does not include those slaughtered in the southern\r\n  regions by the Comanches and other tribes of the Texan frontier, nor\r\n  those killed between March and November, when the skins are unfit\r\n  for tanning. In 1847, the town of St. Louis received 110,000 buffalo\r\n  robes, stags’, deer, and other skins, and twenty-five salted tongues.\r\n\r\n  _To the Forks of the Platte. 11th August._\r\n\r\nPrecisely at 1 35 in the morning we awoke, as we came to a halt at\r\nCotton-wood Station. Cramped with a four days’ and four nights’ ride\r\nin the narrow van, we entered the foul tenement, threw ourselves upon\r\nthe mattresses, averaging three to each, and ten in a small room,\r\nevery door, window, and cranny being shut--after the fashion of these\r\nWestern folks, who make up for a day in the open air by perspiring\r\nthrough the night in unventilated log huts--and, despite musquetoes,\r\nslept.\r\n\r\nThe morning brought with it no joy. We had arrived at the westernmost\r\nlimit of the “gigantic Leicestershire” to which buffalo at this season\r\nextend, and could hope to see no trace of them between Cotton-wood\r\nStation and the Pacific. I can not, therefore, speak _ex cathedrâ_\r\nconcerning this, the noblest “venerie” of the West: almost every one\r\nwho has crossed the prairies, except myself, can. Captain Stansbury[33]\r\nwill enlighten the sportsman upon the approved method of bryttling the\r\nbeasts, and elucidate the mysteries of the “game-beef,” marrow-bone\r\nand depuis, tongue and tender-loin, bass and hump, hump-rib and\r\nliver, which latter, by-the-by, is not unfrequently eaten raw, with a\r\nsprinkling of gall,[34] by the white hunter emulating his wild rival,\r\nas does the European in Abyssinia. The Prairie Traveler has given,\r\nfrom experience, the latest observations concerning the best modes of\r\nhunting the animal. All that remains to me, therefore, is to offer to\r\nthe reader a few details collected from reliable sources, and which are\r\nnot to be found in the two works above alluded to.\r\n\r\n  [33] Exploration and Survey, etc., chap. ix.\r\n\r\n  [34] “Prairie bitters”--made of a pint of water and a quarter of\r\n  a gill of buffalo gall--are considered an _elixir vitæ_ by old\r\n  voyageurs.\r\n\r\nThe bison (_Bison Americanus_) is trivially known as the Prairie\r\nBuffalo, to distinguish it from a different and a larger animal, the\r\nBuffalo of the Woods, which haunts the Rocky Mountains. The “Monarch\r\nof the Prairies,” the “most gigantic of the indigenous mammalia of\r\nAmerica,” has, it is calculated, receded westward ten miles annually\r\nfor the last 150 years. When America was discovered, the buffalo\r\nextended down to the Atlantic shore. Thirty years ago, bands grazed\r\nupon the banks of the Missouri River. The annual destruction is\r\nvariously computed at from 200,000 to 300,000 head: the American Fur\r\nCompany receive per annum about 70,000 robes, which are all cows;\r\nand of these not more than 5000 fall by the hands of white men. At\r\npresent there are three well-known bands, which split up, at certain\r\nseasons, into herds of 2000 and 3000 each. The first family is on\r\nthe head-waters of the Mississippi; the second haunts the vast\r\ncrescent-shaped valley of the Yellow Stone; while the third occupies\r\nthe prairie country between the Platte and the Arkansas. A fourth\r\nband, westward of the Rocky Mountains, is quite extinct. Fourteen to\r\nfifteen years ago, buffalo was found in Utah Valley, and later still\r\nupon the Humboldt River: according to some, they emigrated northward,\r\nthrough Oregon and the lands of the Blackfeet. It is more probable,\r\nhowever, that they were killed off by the severe winter of 1845, their\r\nskulls being still found scattered in heaps, as if a sudden and general\r\ndestruction had come upon the doomed tribe.\r\n\r\n[THE BUFFALO.]\r\n\r\nThe buffalo is partially migratory in its habits: it appears to follow\r\nthe snow, which preserves its food from destruction. Like the antelope\r\nof the Cape, when on the “trek,” the band may be reckoned by thousands.\r\nThe grass, which takes its name from the animal, is plentiful in the\r\nvalley of the Big Blue; it loves the streams of little creeks that have\r\nno bottom-land, and shelters itself under the sage. It is a small,\r\nmoss-like gramen, with dark seed, and, when dry, it has been compared\r\nby travelers to twisted gray horsehair. Smaller herds travel in Indian\r\nfile; their huge bodies, weighing 1500 lbs., appear, from afar, like\r\npiles erected to bridge the plain. After calving, the cows, like the\r\nAfrican koodoo and other antelopes, herd separately from the males,\r\nand for the same reason, timidity and the cares of maternity. As in\r\nthe case of the elephant and the hippopotamus, the oldsters are driven\r\nby the young ones, _en charivari_, from the band, and a compulsory\r\nbachelorhood souring their temper, causes them to become “rogues.” The\r\nalbino, or white buffalo, is exceedingly rare; even veteran hunters\r\nwill confess never to have seen one. The same may be said of the glossy\r\nblack accident called the “silk robe,” supposed by Western men to be a\r\ncross between the parent and the offspring. The buffalo calf has been\r\ntamed by the Flatheads and others: I have never, however, heard of its\r\nbeing utilized.\r\n\r\nThe Dakotahs and other Prairie tribes will degenerate, if not\r\ndisappear, when the buffalo is “rubbed out.” There is a sympathy\r\nbetween them, and the beast flies not from the barbarian and his\r\nbow as it does before the face of the white man and his hot-mouthed\r\nweapon. The aborigines are unwilling to allow travelers, sportsmen,\r\nor explorers to pass through the country while they are hunting the\r\nbuffalo; that is to say, preserving the game till their furs are\r\nready for robes. At these times no one is permitted to kill any but\r\nstragglers, for fear of stampeding the band; the animal not only\r\nbeing timid, but also in the habit of hurrying away cattle and stock,\r\nwhich often are thus irretrievably lost. In due season the savages\r\nsurround one section, and destroy it, the others remaining unalarmedly\r\ngrazing within a few miles of the scene of slaughter. If another tribe\r\ninterferes, it is a _casus belli_, death being the punishment for\r\npoaching. The white man, whose careless style of _battue_ is notorious,\r\nwill be liable to the same penalty, or, that failing, to be plundered\r\nby even “good Indians;” and I have heard of an English gentleman who,\r\nfor persisting in the obnoxious practice, was very properly threatened\r\nwith prosecution by the government agent.\r\n\r\nWhat the cocoanut is to the East Indian, and the plantain and the\r\ncalabash to various tribes of Africans, such is the “bos” to the\r\ncarnivorous son of America. No part of it is allowed to waste. The\r\nhorns and hoofs make glue for various purposes, especially for\r\nfeathering arrows; the brains and part of the bowels are used for\r\ncuring skins; the hide clothes the tribes from head to foot; the\r\ncalf-skins form their apishamores, or saddle-blankets; the sinews\r\nmake their bow-strings, thread, and finer cord; every part of the\r\nflesh, including the fœtus and placenta, is used for food. The surplus\r\nhides are reserved for market. They are prepared by the squaws, who,\r\ncurious to say, will not touch a bear-skin till the age of maternity\r\nhas passed; and they prefer the spoils of the cow, as being softer\r\nthan those of the bull. The skin, after being trimmed with an iron\r\nor bone scraper--this is not done in the case of the “parflèche,”\r\nor thick sole-leather--and softened with brain or marrow, is worked\r\ntill thoroughly pliable with the hands. The fumigation, which gives\r\nthe finishing touch, is confined to buckskins intended for garments.\r\nWhen the hair is removed, the hides supply the place of canvas, which\r\nthey resemble in whiteness and facility of folding. Dressed with the\r\nhair, they are used, as their name denotes, for clothing; they serve\r\nalso for rugs and bedding. In the prairies, the price ranges from $1\r\nto $1 50 in kind; in the Eastern States, from $5 to $10. The fancy\r\nspecimens, painted inside, decorated with eyes, and otherwise adorned\r\nwith split porcupine quills dyed a gamboge-yellow, fetch from $8\r\nto $35. A “buffalo” (_subaudi_ robe) was shown to me, painted with\r\ncurious figures, which, according to my Canadian informant, were a\r\nkind of hieroglyph or _aide-mémoire_, even ruder than the Mexican\r\npicture-writing.\r\n\r\nThe Indians generally hunt the buffalo with arrows. They are so expert\r\nin riding that they will, at full speed, draw the missile from the\r\nvictim’s flank before it falls. I have met but one officer, Captain\r\nHeth, of the 10th Regiment, who ever acquired the art. The Indian\r\nhog-spear has been used to advantage. Our predecessors in Eastern\r\nconquest have killed with it the tiger and nylgau; there is, therefore,\r\nno reason why it might not be efficiently applied to the buffalo. Like\r\nthe Bos Caffre, the bison is dull, surly, and stupid, as well as timid\r\nand wary; it requires hard riding, with the chance of a collar-bone\r\nbroken by the horse falling into a prairie-dog’s home; and when headed\r\nor tired an old male rarely fails to charge.\r\n\r\n[THE MODEL VERANDA.]\r\n\r\nThe flies chasing away the musquetoes--even as Aurora routs the\r\nlingering shades of night--having sounded our _reveillée_ at\r\nCotton-wood Station, we proceeded by means of an “eye-opener,” which\r\neven the abstemious judge could not decline, and the use of the\r\n“skillet,” to prepare for a breakfast composed of various abominations,\r\nespecially cakes of flour and grease, molasses and dirt, disposed in\r\npretty equal parts. After paying the usual 50 cents, we started in the\r\nhigh wind and dust, with a heavy storm brewing in the north, along the\r\ndesert valley of the dark, silent Platte, which here spread out in\r\nbroad basins and lagoons, picturesquely garnished with broad-leafed\r\ndock and beds of _prêle_, flags and water-rushes, in which, however, we\r\nsaw nothing but traces of Monsieur Maringouin. On our left was a line\r\nof sub-conical buttes, red, sandy-clay pyramids, semi-detached from\r\nthe wall of the rock behind them, with smooth flat faces fronting the\r\nriver, toward which they slope at the natural angle of 45°. The land\r\naround, dry and sandy, bore no traces of rain; a high wind blew, and\r\nthe thermometer stood at 78° (F.), which was by no means uncomfortably\r\nwarm. Passing Junction-House Ranch and Frémont Slough--whisky-shops\r\nboth--we halted for “dinner,” about 11 A.M., at Frémont Springs, so\r\ncalled from an excellent little water behind the station. The building\r\nis of a style peculiar to the South, especially Florida--two huts\r\nconnected by a roofwork of thatched timber, which acts as the best\r\nand coolest of verandas. The station-keeper, who receives from the\r\nproprietors of the line $30 per month, had been there only three weeks;\r\nand his wife, a comely young person, uncommonly civil and smiling for\r\na “lady,” supplied us with the luxuries of pigeons, onions, and light\r\nbread, and declared her intention of establishing a poultry-yard.\r\n\r\n[HALF-WAY HOUSE.]\r\n\r\nAn excellent train of mules carried us along a smooth road at a\r\nslapping pace, over another natural garden even more flowery than that\r\npassed on the last day’s march. There were beds of lupins, a brilliant\r\npink and blue predominating, the green plant locally known as “Lamb’s\r\nQuarters” (_Chenopodium album_); the streptanthis; the milk-weed, with\r\nits small white blossoms; the anemone; the wild flax, with its pretty\r\nblue flowers, and growths which appeared to be clematis, chamomile,\r\nand digitalis. Distant black dots--dwarf cedars, which are yearly\r\ndiminishing--lined the bank of the Platte and the long line of River\r\nIsland; they elicited invidious comparisons from the Pennsylvanians of\r\nthe party. We halted at Half-way House, near O’Fallon’s Bluffs, at the\r\nquarters of Mr. M----, a _compagnon de voyage_, who had now reached his\r\nhome of twenty years, and therefore insisted upon “standing drinks.”\r\nThe business is worth $16,000 per annum; the contents of the store\r\nsomewhat like a Parsee’s shop in Western India--every thing from a\r\nneedle to a bottle of Champagne. A sign-board informed us that we were\r\nnow distant 400 miles from St. Jo, 120 from Fort Kearney, 68 from the\r\nupper, and 40 from the lower crossing of the Platte. As we advanced the\r\nvalley narrowed, the stream shrank, the vegetation dwindled, the river\r\nislands were bared of timber, and the only fuel became buffalo chip\r\nand last year’s artemisia. This hideous growth, which is to weary our\r\neyes as far as central valleys of the Sierra Nevada, will require a few\r\nwords of notice.\r\n\r\nThe artemisia, absinthe, or wild sage differs much from the panacea\r\nconcerning which the Salernitan school rhymed:\r\n\r\n    “Cur moriatur homo cui Salvia crescit in horto.”\r\n\r\nYet it fills the air with a smell that caricatures the odor of the\r\ngarden-plant, causing the traveler to look round in astonishment; and\r\nwhen used for cooking it taints the food with a taste between camphor\r\nand turpentine. It is of two kinds. The smaller or white species (_A.\r\nfilifolia_) rarely grows higher than a foot. Its fetor is less rank,\r\nand at times of scarcity it forms tolerable fodder for animals. The\r\nWestern men have made of it, as of the “red root,” a tea, which must\r\nbe pronounced decidedly inferior to corn coffee. The Indians smoke it,\r\nbut they are not particular about what they inhale: like that perverse\r\np----n of Ludlow, who smoked the bell-ropes rather than not smoke at\r\nall, or like school-boys who break themselves in upon ratan, they use\r\neven the larger sage as well as a variety of other graveolent growths.\r\nThe second kind (_A. tridentata_) is to the family of shrubs what\r\nthe prairie cedar is to the trees--a gnarled, crooked, rough-barked\r\ndeformity. It has no pretensions to beauty except in earliest youth,\r\nand in the dewy hours when the breeze turns up its leaves that glitter\r\nlike silver in the sun; and its constant presence in the worst and most\r\ndesert tracts teaches one to regard it, like the mangrove in Asia and\r\nAfrica, with aversion. In size it greatly varies; in some places it\r\nis but little larger than the white species; near the Red Buttes its\r\nwoody stem often attains the height of a man and the thickness of his\r\nwaist. As many as fifty rings have been counted in one wood, which,\r\naccording to the normal calculation, would bring its age up to half a\r\ncentury. After its first year, stock will eat it only when threatened\r\nwith starvation. It has, however, its use; the traveler, despite its\r\nugliness, hails the appearance of its stiff, wiry clumps at the evening\r\nhalt: it is easily uprooted, and by virtue of its essential oil it\r\nmakes a hot and lasting fire, and ashes over. According to Colonel\r\nFrémont, “it has a small fly accompanying it through every change of\r\nelevation and latitude.” The same eminent authority also suggests that\r\nthe respiration of air so highly impregnated with aromatic plants may\r\npartly account for the favorable effect of the climate upon consumption.\r\n\r\nAt 5 P.M., as the heat began to mitigate, we arrived at Alkali Lake\r\nStation, and discovered some “exiles from Erin,” who supplied us with\r\nantelope meat and the unusual luxury of ice taken from the Platte. We\r\nattempted to bathe in the river, but found it flowing liquid mire. The\r\nAlkali Lake was out of sight; the driver, however, consoled me with the\r\nreflection that I should “glimpse” alkali lakes till I was sick of them.\r\n\r\nYesterday and to-day we have been in a line of Indian “removes.” The\r\nwild people were shifting their quarters for grass; when it becomes a\r\nlittle colder they will seek some winter abode on the banks of a stream\r\nwhich supplies fuel and where they can find meat, so that with warmth\r\nand food, song and chat--they are fond of talking nonsense as African\r\nnegroes--and smoke and sleep, they can while away the dull and dreary\r\nwinter. Before describing the scene, which might almost serve for a\r\npicture of Bedouin or gipsy life--so similar are the customs of all\r\nsavages--I have something to say about the Red Man.\r\n\r\n[THE RED MEN.]\r\n\r\nThis is a country of misnomers. America should not, according to the\r\nschool-books, have been named America, consequently the Americans\r\nshould not be called Americans. A geographical error, pardonable in the\r\nfifteenth century, dubbed the old tenants of these lands Indians,[35]\r\nbut why we should still call them the Red Men can not be conceived. I\r\nhave now seen them in the north, south, east, and west of the United\r\nStates, yet never, except under the influence of ochre or vermilion,\r\nhave I seen the Red Man red. The real color of the skin, as may be seen\r\nunder the leggins, varies from a dead pale olive to a dark dingy brown.\r\nThe parts exposed to the sun are slightly burnished, as in a Tartar\r\nor an Affghan after a summer march. Between the two extremes above\r\nindicated there are, however, a thousand shades of color, and often the\r\nskin has been so long grimed in with pigment, grease, and dirt that it\r\nsuggests a brick-dust tinge which a little soap or soda would readily\r\nremove. Indeed, the color and the complexion, combined with the lank\r\nhair, scant beard, and similar peculiarities, renders it impossible to\r\nsee this people for the first time without the strongest impression\r\nthat they are of that Turanian breed which in prehistoric ages passed\r\ndown from above the Himalayas as far south as Cape Comorin.\r\n\r\n  [35] Columbus and Vespucius both died in the conviction that they\r\n  had only discovered portions of Asia. Indeed, as late as 1533, the\r\n  astronomer Schöner maintained that Mexico was the Quinsai of Marco\r\n  Polo. The early navigators called the aborigines of the New World\r\n  “Indians,” believing that they inhabited the eastern portion of\r\n  “India,” a term then applied to the extremity of Oriental Asia. Until\r\n  the present century the Spaniards applied the names India and Indies\r\n  to their possessions in America.\r\n\r\nAnother mistake touching the Indian is the present opinion concerning\r\nhim and his ancestors. He now suffers in public esteem from the\r\nreaction following the high-flown descriptions of Cooper and the\r\nherd of minor romancers who could not but make their heroes heroes.\r\nMoreover, men acquainted only with the degenerate Pawnees or Diggers\r\nextend their evil opinions to the noble tribes now extinct--the\r\nIroquois and Algonquins, for instance, whose remnants, the Delawares\r\nand Ojibwas, justify the high opinion of the first settlers. The\r\nexploits of King Philip, Pontiac, Gurister Sego, Tecumseh, Keokuk,\r\nIatan, Captain J. Brant, Black Hawk, Red Jacket, Osceola, and Billy\r\nBowlegs, are rapidly fading away from memory, while the failures of\r\nsuch men as Little Thunder, and those like him, stand prominently forth\r\nin modern days. Besides the injustice to the manes and memories of\r\nthe dead, this depreciation of the Indians tends to serious practical\r\nevils. Those who see the savage lying drunk about stations, or eaten\r\nup with disease, expect to beat him out of the field by merely showing\r\ntheir faces; they fail, and pay the penalty with their lives--an event\r\nwhich occurs every year in some parts of America.\r\n\r\n[PRAIRIE-INDIAN DRESS.]\r\n\r\nThe remove of the village presented an interesting sight--an animated\r\nshifting scene of bucks and braves, squaws and pappooses, ponies\r\ndwarfed by bad breeding and hard living, dogs and puppies struggling\r\nover the plains westward. In front, singly or in pairs, rode the men,\r\nnot gracefully, not according to the rules of Mexican _manège_, but\r\nlike the Abyssinian eunuch, as if born upon and bred to become part of\r\nthe animal. Some went barebacked; others rode, like the ancient chiefs\r\nof the Western Islands, upon a saddle-tree, stirrupless, or provided\r\nwith hollow blocks of wood: in some cases the saddle was adorned with\r\nbead hangings, and in all a piece of buffalo hide with the hair on was\r\nattached beneath to prevent chafing. The cruel ring-bit of the Arabs\r\nis not unknown. A few had iron curbs, probably stolen. For the most\r\npart they managed their nags with a hide thong lashed round the lower\r\njaw and attached to the neck. A whip, of various sizes and shapes,\r\nsometimes a round and tattooed ferule, more often a handle like a\r\nbutcher’s tally-stick, flat, notched, one foot long, and provided with\r\ntwo or three thongs, hung at the wrist. Their nags were not shod with\r\nparflèche, as among the horse-Indians of the South. Their long, lank,\r\nthick, brownish-black hair, ruddy from the effects of weather, was\r\nworn parted in the middle, and depended from the temples confined with\r\na long twist of otter or beaver’s skin in two queues, or pig-tails,\r\nreaching to the breast: from the poll, and distinct from the remainder\r\nof the hair, streamed the scalp-lock. This style of hair-dressing,\r\ndoubtless, aids in giving to the coronal region that appearance of\r\ndepression which characterizes the North American Indians as a race\r\nof “Flatheads,” and which, probably being considered a beauty, led to\r\nthe artificial deformities of the Peruvian and the Aztec. The parting\r\nin men, as well as in women, was generally colored with vermilion,\r\nand plates of brass or tin, with beveled edges, varying in size from\r\na shilling to half a crown, were inserted into the front hair. The\r\nscalp-lock--in fops the side-locks also--was decorated with tin or\r\nsilver plates, often twelve in number, beginning from the head and\r\ngradually diminishing in size as they approached the heels; a few had\r\neagle’s, hawk’s, and crow’s feathers stuck in the hair, and sometimes,\r\ngrotesquely enough, crownless Kossuth hats, felt broadbrims, or old\r\nmilitary casquettes, surmounted all this finery. Their scanty beard\r\nwas removed; they compare the bushy-faced European to a dog running\r\naway with a squirrel in its mouth. In their ears were rings of beads,\r\nwith pendants of tin plates or mother of pearl, or huge circles of\r\nbrass wire not unlike a Hindoo tailor’s; and their fore-arms, wrists,\r\nand fingers were, after an African fashion, adorned with the same\r\nmetals, which the savage ever prefers to gold or silver. Their other\r\ndecorations were cravats of white or white and blue, oval beads, and\r\nnecklaces of plates like those worn in the hair. The body dress was\r\na tight-sleeved waistcoat of dark drugget, over an American cotton\r\nshirt; others wore tattered flannels, and the middle was wrapped round\r\nwith a common blanket, presented by the government agent--scarlet\r\nand blue being the colors preferred, white rare: a better stuff is\r\nthe coarse broadcloth manufactured for the Indian market in the\r\nUnited States. The leggins were a pair of pantaloons without the body\r\npart--in their palmy days the Indians laughed to scorn their future\r\nconquerors for tightening the hips so as to impede activity--looped\r\nup at both haunches with straps to a leathern girdle, and all wore\r\nthe breech-cloth, which is the common Hindoo languti or T-bandage.\r\nThe cut of the leggins is a parallelogram, a little too short and\r\nmuch too broad for the limb; it is sewn so as to fit tight, and the\r\nprojecting edges, for which the light-colored list or bordering is\r\nusually preserved, answers the effect of a military stripe. When\r\nbuckskin leggins are made the outside edges are fringed, producing\r\nthat feathered appearance which distinguishes in our pictures the\r\nnether limbs of the Indian brave. The garb ends with moccasins,[36] the\r\nAmerican brogues, which are made in two ways. The simplest are of one\r\npiece, a cylinder of skin cut from above and below the hock of some\r\nlarge animal--moose, elk, or buffalo--and drawn on before shrinking,\r\nthe joint forming the heel, while the smaller end is sewn together for\r\na toe. This rough contrivance is little used but as a _pis aller_. The\r\nother kind is made of tanned hide in two pieces--a sole and an upper\r\nleather, sewn together at the junction; the last is a bit of board\r\nrounded off at the end. They are open over the instep, where also\r\nthey can be laced or tied, and they fit as closely as the Egyptian\r\nmizz or under-slipper, which they greatly resemble. They are worn by\r\nofficers in the Far West as the expatriated Anglo-Indian adopts the\r\n“Juti.” The greatest inconvenience to the novice is the want of heel;\r\nmoreover, they render the feet uncomfortably tender, and, unless soled\r\nwith parflèche or thick leather, they are scant defense against stony\r\nground; during dry weather they will last fairly, but they become,\r\nafter a single wetting, even worse than Bombay-made Wellingtons. A\r\ncommon pair will cost $2; when handsomely embroidered with bead-work by\r\nthe squaws they rise to $15.\r\n\r\n  [36] This Algonquin word is written _moccasson_ or _mocasin_, and is\r\n  pronounced _moksin_.\r\n\r\nThe braves were armed with small tomahawks or iron hatchets, which\r\nthey carried with the powder-horn, in the belt, on the right side,\r\nwhile the long tobacco-pouch of antelope skin hung by the left. Over\r\ntheir shoulders were leather targes, bows and arrows, and some few had\r\nrifles; both weapons were defended from damp in deer-skin cases, and\r\nquivers with the inevitable bead-work, and the fringes which every\r\nsavage seems to love. These articles reminded me of those in use\r\namong the Bedouins of El Hejaz. Their nags were lean and ungroomed;\r\nthey treat them as cruelly as do the Somal; yet nothing--short of\r\nwhisky--can persuade the Indian warrior, like the man of Nejd, to part\r\nwith a favorite steed. It is his all in all, his means of livelihood,\r\nhis profession, his pride; he is an excellent judge of horse-flesh,\r\nthough ignoring the mule and ass; and if he offers an animal for\r\nwhich he has once refused to trade, it is for the reason that an\r\nOriental takes to market an adult slave--it has become useless. Like\r\nthe Arab, he considers it dishonorable to sell a horse; he gives it\r\nto you, expecting a large present, and if disappointed he goes away\r\ngrumbling that you have “swallowed” his property. He is fond of short\r\nraces--spurts they are called--as we had occasion to see; there is\r\nnothing novel nor interesting in the American as there is in the\r\nArabian hippology; the former learned all its arts from Europeans, the\r\nlatter taught them.\r\n\r\nBehind the warriors and braves followed the baggage of the village.\r\nThe lodge poles, in bundles of four and five, had been lashed to pads\r\nor pack-saddles, girthed tight to the ponies’ backs, the other ends\r\nbeing allowed to trail along the ground like the shafts of a truck;\r\nthe sign easily denotes the course of travel. The wolf-like dogs were\r\nalso harnessed in the same way; more lupine than canine, they are ready\r\nwhen hungry to attack man or mule; and, sharp-nosed and prick-eared,\r\nthey not a little resemble the Indian pariah dog. Their equipments,\r\nhowever, were of course on a diminutive scale; a little pad girthed\r\nround the barrel, with a breastplate to keep it in place, enabled\r\nthem to drag two short light lodge poles tied together at the smaller\r\nextremity. One carried only a hawk on its back--yet falconry has\r\nnever, I believe, been practiced by the Indian. Behind the ponies the\r\npoles were connected by cross-sticks, upon which were lashed the lodge\r\ncovers, the buffalo robes, and other bulkier articles. Some had strong\r\nframes of withes or willow basket-work, two branches being bent into\r\nan oval, garnished below with a net-work of hide thongs for a seat,\r\ncovered with a light wicker canopy, and opening, like a cage, only on\r\none side; a blanket or a buffalo robe defends the inmate from sun and\r\nrain. These are the litters for the squaws when weary, the children,\r\nand the puppies, which are part of the family till used for feasts.\r\nIt might be supposed to be a rough conveyance; the elasticity of the\r\npoles, however, alleviates much of that inconvenience. A very ancient\r\nman, wrinkled as a last year’s walnut, and apparently crippled by old\r\nwounds, was carried, probably by his great-grandsons, in a rude sedan.\r\nThe vehicle was composed of two pliable poles, about ten feet long,\r\nseparated by three cross-bars twenty inches or so apart; a blanket had\r\nbeen secured to the foremost and hindermost, and under the centre-bit\r\nlay Senex secured against falling out. In this way the Indians often\r\nbear the wounded back to their villages; apparently they have never\r\nthought of a horse-litter, which might be made with equal facility, and\r\nwould certainly save work.\r\n\r\n[THE SQUAWS.]\r\n\r\nWhile the rich squaws rode, the poorer followed their pack-horses on\r\nfoot, eying the more fortunate as the mercer’s wife regards what she\r\nterms the “carriage lady.” The women’s dress not a little resembles\r\ntheir lords’; the unaccustomed eye often hesitates between the sexes.\r\nIn the fair, however, the waistcoat is absent, the wide-sleeved shift\r\nextends below the knees, and the leggins are of somewhat different cut.\r\nAll wore coarse shawls, or white, blue, and scarlet cloth-blankets\r\nround their bodies. Upon the Upper Platte we afterward saw them dressed\r\nin cotton gowns, after a semi-civilized fashion, and with bowie-knives\r\nby their sides. The grandmothers were fearful to look upon--horrid\r\nexcrescences of nature, teaching proud man a lesson of humility, and\r\na memento of his neighbor in creation, the “humble ape”--it is only\r\ncivilization that can save the aged woman from resembling the gorilla.\r\nThe middle-aged matrons were homely bodies, broad and squat like the\r\nAfrican dame after she has become _mère de famille_; their hands and\r\nfeet were notably larger from work than those of the men, and the\r\nburdens upon their backs caused them to stoop painfully. The young\r\nsquaws--pity it is that all our household Indian words, pappoose, for\r\ninstance, tomahawk, wigwam, and powwow, should have been naturalized\r\nout of the Abenaki and other harsh dialects of New England--deserved\r\na more euphonious appellation. The belle savage of the party had\r\nlarge and languishing eyes and dentists’ teeth that glittered, with\r\nsleek, long black hair like the ears of a Blenheim spaniel, justifying\r\na natural instinct to stroke or pat it, drawn straight over a low,\r\nbroad, Quadroon-like brow. Her figure had none of the fragility which\r\ndistinguishes the higher race, who are apparently too delicate for\r\nhuman nature’s daily food--porcelain, in fact, when pottery is wanted;\r\nnor had she the square corpulency which appears in the negro woman\r\nafter marriage. Her ears and neck were laden with tinsel ornaments,\r\nbrass-wire rings adorned her wrists and fine arms, a bead-work sash\r\nencircled her waist, and scarlet leggins, fringed and tasseled, ended\r\nin equally costly moccasins. When addressed by the driver in some\r\nterms to me unintelligible, she replied with a soft clear laugh--the\r\nprincipal charm of the Indian, as of the smooth-throated African\r\nwoman--at the same time showing him the palm of her right hand as\r\nthough it had been a looking-glass. The gesture would have had a\r\npeculiar significance in Sindh; here, however, I afterward learned,\r\nit simply conveys a refusal. The maidens of the tribe, or those under\r\nsix, were charming little creatures, with the wildest and most piquant\r\nexpression, and the prettiest doll-like features imaginable; the young\r\ncoquettes already conferred their smiles as if they had been of any\r\nearthly value. The boys once more reminded me of the East; they had\r\nblack beady eyes, like snakes, and the wide mouths of young caymans.\r\nTheir only dress, when they were not in “birth-day suit,” was the\r\nIndian languti. None of the braves carried scalps, finger-bones, or\r\nnotches on the lance, which serve like certain marks on saw-handled\r\npistols farther east, nor had any man lost a limb. They followed us for\r\nmany a mile, peering into the hinder part of our traveling wigwam, and\r\nejaculating “How! How!” the normal salutation. It is supposed to mean\r\n“good,” and the Western man, when he drinks to your health, says “Here,\r\nhow!” and expects a return in kind. The politeness of the savages\r\ndid not throw us off our guard; the Dakotah of these regions are\r\nexpert and daring kleptomaniacs; they only laughed, however, a little\r\nknowingly as we raised the rear curtain, and they left us after begging\r\npertinaciously--bakhshish is an institution here as on the banks of the\r\nNile--for tobacco, gunpowder, ball, copper caps, lucifers, and what\r\nnot. The women, except the pretty party, looked, methought, somewhat\r\nscowlingly, but one can hardly expect a smiling countenance from the\r\nhuman biped trudging ten or twenty miles under a load fit for a mule.\r\nA great contrast with these Indians was a train of “Pike’s Peakers,”\r\nwho, to judge from their grim looks, were returning disappointed from\r\nthe new gold diggings. I think that if obliged to meet one of the two\r\ntroops by moonlight alone, my choice would have fallen upon “messieurs\r\nles sauvages.”\r\n\r\nAt 6 P.M. we resumed our route, with a good but fidgety train, up the\r\nDark Valley, where musquetoes and sultry heat combined to worry us.\r\nSlowly traveling and dozing the while, we arrived about 9 15 P.M.\r\nat Diamond Springs, a bright little water much frequented by the\r\n“lightning-bug” and the big-eyed “Devil’s darning-needle,”[37] where we\r\nfound whisky and its usual accompaniment, soldiers. The host related\r\nan event which he said had taken place but a few days before. An old\r\nmountaineer, who had married two squaws, was drinking with certain\r\nCheyennes, a tribe famous for ferocity and hostility to the whites. The\r\ndiscourse turning upon topics stoical, he was asked by his wild boon\r\ncompanions if he feared death. The answer was characteristic: “You may\r\nkill me if you like!” Equally characteristic was their acknowledgment;\r\nthey hacked him to pieces, and threw the corpse under a bank. In these\r\nregions the opposite races regard each other as wild beasts; the white\r\nwill shoot an Indian as he would a coyote. He expects to go under\r\nwhenever the “all-fired, red-bellied varmints”--I speak, oh reader,\r\nOccidentally--get the upper hand, and _vice versâ_.\r\n\r\n  [37] The first is the firefly, the second is the dragon-fly, called\r\n  in country parts of England “the Devil’s needle.”\r\n\r\n[THE PLATTE RIVER.]\r\n\r\nThe Platte River divides at N. lat. 40° 05′ 05″, and W. long. (G.)\r\n101° 21′ 24″. The northern, by virtue of dimensions, claims to be\r\nthe main stream. The southern, which is also called in obsolete maps\r\nPadouca, from the Pawnee name for the Iatans, whom the Spaniards\r\nterm Comanches,[38] averages 600 yards, about 100 less than its\r\nrival in breadth, and, according to the prairie people, affords the\r\nbest drinking. Hunters often ford the river by the Lower Crossing,\r\ntwenty-eight miles above the bifurcation. Those with heavily-loaded\r\nwagons prefer this route, as by it they avoid the deep loose sands on\r\nthe way to the Upper Crossing. The mail-coach must endure the four\r\nmiles of difficulty, as the road to Denver City branches off from the\r\nwestern ford.\r\n\r\n  [38] The Kaumainsh (Comanche), a warlike and independent race, who,\r\n  with the Apaches, have long been the bane of New Spain, were in the\r\n  beginning of this century entirely erratic, without any kind of\r\n  cultivation, subsisting, in fact, wholly by the chase and plunder.\r\n  They were then bounded westward by New Mexico, where they have laid\r\n  waste many a thriving settlement; eastward by the Pawnees and Osages;\r\n  northward by the Utahs, Kiowas, and Shoshonees; and southward by the\r\n  nations on the Lower Red River.\r\n\r\nAt 10 P.M., having “caught up” the mules, we left Diamond Springs, and\r\nran along the shallow river which lay like a thin sheet of shimmer\r\nbroken by clumps and islets that simulated, under the imperfect\r\nlight of the stars, houses and towns, hulks and ships, wharves and\r\nesplanades. On the banks large bare spots, white with salt, glistened\r\nthrough the glooms; the land became so heavy that our fagged beasts\r\ngroaned; and the descents, water-cuts, and angles were so abrupt that\r\nholding on constituted a fair gymnastic exercise. The air was clear\r\nand fine. My companions snored while I remained awake enjoying a\r\nlovely aurora, and, Epicurean-like, reserving sleep for the Sybaritic\r\napparatus, which, according to report, awaited us at the grand\r\n_établissement_ of the Upper Crossing of La Grande Platte.\r\n\r\nThis was our fifth night in the mail-wagon. I could not but meditate\r\nupon the difference between travel in the pure prairie air, despite an\r\noccasional “chill,” and the perspiring miseries of an East Indian dawk,\r\nor of a trudge in the miasmatic and pestilential regions of Central\r\nAfrica. Much may be endured when, as was ever the case, the highest\r\ntemperature in the shade does not exceed 98° F.\r\n\r\n  _12th August. We cross the Platte._\r\n\r\n[AURORA.]\r\n\r\nBoreal aurora glared brighter than a sunset in Syria. The long\r\nstreamers were intercepted and mysteriously confused by a massive\r\nstratum of dark cloud, through whose narrow rifts and jagged chinks the\r\nsplendors poured in floods of magic fire. Near the horizon the tint\r\nwas an opaline white--a broad band of calm, steady light, supporting\r\na tender rose-color, which flushed to crimson as it scaled the upper\r\nfirmament. The mobility of the spectacle was its chiefest charm. The\r\nstreamers either shot out or shrank from full to half length; now they\r\nflared up, widening till they filled the space between Lucifer rising\r\nin the east and Aries setting in the west; then they narrowed to the\r\nsize of a span; now they stood like a red arch with steadfast legs and\r\noscillating summit; then, broadening at the apex, they apparently\r\nrevolved with immense rapidity; at times the stars shone undimmed\r\nthrough the veil of light, then they were immersed in its exceeding\r\nbrilliancy. After a full hour of changeful beauty, paling in one place\r\nand blushing in another, the northern lights slowly faded away with a\r\nblush which made the sunrise look colder than its wont. It is no wonder\r\nthat the imaginative Indian, looking with love upon these beauties,\r\nconnects them with the ghosts of his ancestors.\r\n\r\nCramped with cold and inaction--at 6 A.M. the thermometer showed only\r\n56° F. in the sun--hungry, thirsty, and by no means in the mildest of\r\nhumors, we hear with a gush of joy, at 3 15 A.M., the savage Yep! yep!\r\nyep! with which the driver announces our approach. The plank lodgings\r\nsoon appear; we spring out of the ambulance; a qualm comes over us;\r\nall is dark and silent as the grave; nothing is prepared for us; the\r\nwretches are all asleep. A heavy kick opens the door of the soon-found\r\nrestaurant, when a pheesy, drowsy voice from an inner room asks us, in\r\nGerman-English--so strong is the causality, the crapulousness of why\r\nand wherefore in this “divided, erudite race”--“And how ze komen in?”\r\nWithout attempting to gratify his intellectual cravings, we ordered him\r\nout of bed, and began to talk of supper, refreshment, and repose. But\r\nthe “critter” had waxed surly after securing for himself a compound\r\nepithet, of which “hunds--” is the first syllable, and his every\r\nnegative answer concluded with a faint murmur of “petampt.” I tried to\r\nget his bed for Mrs. Dana, who was suffering severely from fatigue. He\r\ngrumbled out that his “lady and bebbé” were occupying it. At length I\r\nhit upon the plan of placing the cushions and cloaks upon the table,\r\nwhen the door opened for a second dog-Teuton, who objected to that\r\narticle of furniture being used otherwise than for his morning meal.\r\n_Excédés_, and mastering with pain our desire to give these villain\r\n“sausage-eaters” “particular fits,” we sat down, stared at the fire,\r\nand awaited the vile food. For a breakfast cooked in the usual manner,\r\ncoffee boiled down to tannin (ever the first operation), meat subjected\r\nto half sod, half stew, and, lastly, bread raised with sour milk\r\ncorrected with soda, and so baked that the taste of the flour is ever\r\nprominent, we paid these German rascals 75 cents, a little dearer than\r\nat the Trois Frères.\r\n\r\nAt the Upper Crossing of the South Fork there are usually tender\r\nadieux, the wenders toward Mormonland bidding farewell to those bound\r\nfor the perilous gold regions of Denver City and Pike’s Peak. If\r\n“fresh,” they take leave of one another with sincere commiseration for\r\none another’s dooms, each deeming, of course, his own the brighter.\r\nThe wagons were unloaded, thus giving us the opportunity of procuring\r\nchanges of raiment and fresh caps--our felts had long disappeared under\r\nthe influence of sleeping on the perch. By some means we retained our\r\nold ambulance, which, after five days and nights, we had learned to\r\nlook upon as a home; the Judiciary, however, had to exchange theirs\r\nfor one much lighter and far less comfortable. Presently those bound\r\nto Denver City set out upon their journey. Conspicuous among them\r\nwas a fair woman who had made her first appearance at Cotton-wood\r\nCreek--fit place for the _lune de mélasse_--with an individual,\r\napparently a well-to-do drover, whom she called “Tom” and “husband.”\r\nShe had forgotten her “fixins,” which, according to a mischievous and\r\nscandalous driver, consisted of a reticule containing a “bishop,” a\r\ncomb, and a pomatum-pot, a pinchbeck watch, and a flask of “Bawme”--not\r\nof Meccah. Being a fine young person of Scotch descent, she had, till\r\ndire suspicions presented themselves, attracted the attentions of her\r\nfellow-travelers, who pronounced her to be “all sorts of a gal.” But\r\nvirtue is rabid in these lands, and the purity of the ermine must not\r\nbe soiled. It was fortunate for Mr. and Mrs. Mann--the names were _noms\r\nde voyage_--that they left us so soon. In a certain Southern city I\r\nheard of a high official who, during a trip upon one of the floating\r\npalaces of the Mississippi, had to repeat “deprendi miserum est;” the\r\nfond, frail pair was summarily ejected with bag and baggage to furnish\r\nitself with a down-stream passage on board a lumber raft.\r\n\r\n[THE “PADOUCA.”]\r\n\r\nWe crossed the “Padouca” at 6 30 A.M., having placed our luggage and\r\nthe mails for security in an ox cart. The South Fork is here 600 to 700\r\nyards broad; the current is swift, but the deepest water not exceeding\r\n250 feet, the teams are not compelled to cross diagonally. The channel\r\nwas broken with sand-banks and islets; the bed was dark and gravelly;\r\nthe water, though dark as hotel coffee, was clear, not, as described\r\nby Captain Stansbury, “perfectly opaque with thick yellow mud,” and\r\nthe earth-banks, which rise to five feet, are never inundated. The\r\nhalf-broken mules often halted, and seemed inclined to lie down; a\r\nyouth waded on the lower side of the team, shouting and swinging his\r\narms to keep them from turning their heads down stream; the instinct\r\nof animals to find an easy ford ended with a few desperate struggles\r\nup the black oozy mire. Having reloaded on the left bank, and cast one\r\nlast look of hatred upon the scene of our late disappointment, we set\r\nout at 7 A.M. to cross the divide separating the Northern and Southern\r\nForks of the Platte.\r\n\r\nWe had now entered upon the outskirts of the American wilderness,\r\nwhich has not one feature in common with the deserts of the Old World.\r\nIn Arabia and Africa there is majesty in its monotony: those awful\r\nwastes so brightly sunburnished that the air above them appears by\r\ncontrast black; one vast and burning floor, variegated only by the\r\nmirage-reek, with nothing below the firmament to relieve or correct\r\nthe eye. Here it is a brown smooth space, insensibly curving out of\r\nsight, wholly wanting “second distance,” and scarcely suggesting the\r\nidea of immensity; we seem, in fact, to be traveling for twenty miles\r\nover a convex, treeless hill-top. The air became sultry, white clouds\r\nshut in the sky, and presently arose the high south wind, which at this\r\nseason blows a gale between 10 A.M. and 3 P.M. The ground, bleached\r\nwhere sandy, was thinly scattered here and there with wiry grass, dun\r\nand withered, and with coarse and sunburnt shrubs, among which the\r\n“leadplant” (_Amorphe canescens_) was the characteristic. A dwarf\r\naloetic vegetation became abundant; vegetation was fast going the way\r\nof all grass; after rain, however, it is doubtless fresh and copious.\r\nThe buffalo grass sought the shade of the wild sage. A small euphorbia,\r\nthe cotton-weed, a thistle haunted by the Cynthia cardua, that\r\nbutterfly common to the eastern and western hemispheres, and a bright\r\nputoria, mingled with mushrooms like huge bulbs. The cactus was of two\r\nkinds: the flat-leaved species is used by white men to filter water,\r\nand by the savages, who peel and toast it, as provaunt:[39] there is\r\nanother globular variety (an _echinocactus_) lying stalkless, like a\r\nhalf melon, with its brilliant flowers guarded by a panoply of spines.\r\nWe pursued a sandy tract, broken by beds of nullahs and fiumaras,\r\nbetween two ridges of hillocks, draining to the right into a low bottom\r\ndenoted by a lively green, with bays and bends of lush, reed-like\r\ngrass. This is the well-known Lodge-Pole Creek or Fork, a mere ditch,\r\nthe longest and narrowest of its kind, rising from a mountain lakelet\r\nnear the “New Bayou” or “Park,” in the Black Hills, and falling\r\ninto the South Fork of the Platte, about seventy miles west of the\r\nbifurcation. By following up this water along the Cherokee trail to its\r\nhead in the Cheyenne Pass of the Rocky Mountains, instead of describing\r\nthe arc _viâ_ Fort Laramie, the mail would gain 61 miles; emigrants,\r\nindeed, often prefer the short cut. Moreover, from the Cheyenne Pass to\r\nGreat Salt Lake City, there is, according to accounts, a practicable\r\nroad south of the present line, which, as it would also save time and\r\nlabor, has been preferred for the mail line.\r\n\r\n  [39] There is another kind of cactus called by the whites\r\n  “whisky-root,” and by the Indian “peioke,” used like the intoxicating\r\n  mushroom of Siberia. “It grows in Southern Texas, in the range of\r\n  sand-hills bordering on the Rio Grande, and in gravelly, sandy\r\n  soil. The Indians eat it for its exhilarating effect on the system,\r\n  producing precisely the same excitement as alcoholic drinks. It\r\n  is sliced as you would a cucumber; the small piece is chewed and\r\n  swallowed, and in about the same time as comfortably tight cocktails\r\n  would ‘stir the divinity within’ you, this indicates itself; only\r\n  its effects are what I might term a little _k-a-v-o-r-t-i-n-g_,\r\n  giving rather a wilder scope to the imagination and actions.”--(A\r\n  Correspondent of the _New Orleans Picayune_, quoted by Mr. Bartlett.)\r\n\r\nIn the American Sahara animal life began to appear. The coyote turned\r\nand stared at us as though we were trespassing upon his property.\r\nThis is the jackal of the Western world, the small prairie-wolf, the\r\n_Canis latrans_, and the old Mexican coyotl, best depicted by the\r\nold traveler, Abbé Clavigero, in these words: “It is a wild beast,\r\nvoracious like the wolf, cunning like the fox, in form like the dog,\r\nand in some qualities like the jackal.” The animal has so often been\r\ndescribed that there is little new to say about it. The mountain men\r\nare all agreed upon one thing, namely, that the meat is by no means\r\nbad; most of them have tried “wolf-mutton” in hard times, and may\r\nexpect to do so again. The civilizee shudders at the idea of eating\r\nwolf from a food-prejudice, whose consideration forms a curious\r\nchapter in human history. It is not very easy, says Dr. Johnson, to\r\nfix the principles upon which mankind have agreed to eat some animals\r\nand reject others; and as the principle is not evident, so it is not\r\nuniform. Originally invented for hygienic purposes, dietetic laws\r\nsoon became tenets of religion, and passed far beyond their original\r\nintention: thus pork, for instance, injurious in Syria, would not be\r\neaten by a Jew in Russia. An extreme arbitrariness marks the modern\r\nsystems of civilized people: the Englishman, for instance, eats\r\noysters, periwinkles, shrimps, and frogs, while he is nauseated by the\r\nsnails, robins, and crows which the Frenchman uses; the Italian will\r\ndevour a hawk, while he considers a rabbit impure, and has refused to\r\ntouch potatoes even in a famine; and all delight in that foul feeder,\r\nthe duck, while they reject the meat of the cleanly ass. The Mosaic law\r\nseems still to influence the European world, causing men to throw away\r\nmuch valuable provision because unaccustomed to eat it or to hear of\r\nits being eaten. The systems of China and Japan are far more sensible\r\nfor densely populated countries, and the hippophagists have shown, at\r\nleast, that one animal has been greatly wasted. The terrible famines,\r\nfollowed by the equally fearful pestilences, which have scourged\r\nmankind, are mainly owing to the prevalence of these food-prejudices,\r\nwhich, as might be expected, are the most deeply rooted in the poorer\r\nclasses, who can least afford them.\r\n\r\n[THE PRAIRIE-DOG VILLAGE.]\r\n\r\nI saw to-day, for the first time, a prairie-dog village. The little\r\nbeast, hardly as large as a Guinea-pig, belongs to the family of\r\nsquirrels and the group of marmots--in point of manner it somewhat\r\nresembles the monkey. “Wish-ton-Wish”[40]--an Indian onomatoplasm--was\r\nat home, sitting posted like a sentinel upon the roof, and sunning\r\nhimself in the midday glow. It is not easy to shoot him; he is out of\r\ndoors all day; but, timid and alert, at the least suspicion of danger\r\nhe plunges with a jerking of the tail, and a somersault, quicker than\r\na shy young rabbit’s, into the nearest hole, peeping from the ground,\r\nand keeping up a feeble little cry (wish! ton! wish!), more like the\r\nnote of a bird than a bark. If not killed outright, he will manage\r\nto wriggle into his home. The villages are generally on the brow of\r\na hill, near a creek or pond, thus securing water without danger of\r\ndrowning. The earth burrowed out while making the habitations is\r\nthrown up in heaps, which serve as sitting-places in the wet season,\r\nand give a look-out upon the adjacent country; it is more dangerous\r\nto ride over them than to charge a field of East Indian “T’hur,” and\r\nmany a broken leg and collar-bone have been the result. The holes,\r\nwhich descend in a spiral form, must be deep, and they are connected\r\nby long galleries, with sharp angles, ascents and descents, to puzzle\r\nthe pursuer. Lieutenant Pike had 140 kettles of water poured into one\r\nwithout dislodging the occupant. The village is always cleared of\r\ngrass, probably by the necessities of the tenants, who, though they\r\nenjoy insects, are mainly graminivorous, and rarely venture half a\r\nmile from home. The limits are sometimes three miles square, and the\r\npopulation must be dense, as a burrow will occur every few paces. The\r\n_Cynomys Ludovicianus_ prepares for winter by stopping the mouth of\r\nits burrow, and constructing a deeper cell, in which it hibernates\r\ntill spring appears. It is a graceful little animal, dark brown above\r\nand white below, with teeth and nails, head and tail somewhat like\r\nthe gray sciurus of the States. The Indians and trappers eat this\r\nAmerican marmot, declaring its flesh to be fatter and better than\r\nthat of the squirrel. Some travelers advise exposing the meat for a\r\nnight or two to the frost, by which means the rankness of subterranean\r\nflavor is corrected. It is undoubted that the rattlesnake--both of the\r\nyellow and black species--and the small white burrowing-owl (_Strix\r\ncunicularia_) are often found in the same warren with this rodent, a\r\ncurious happy family of reptile, bird, and beast, and in some places\r\nhe has been seen to associate with tortoises, rattlesnakes, and horned\r\nfrogs (_Phrynosoma_). According to some naturalists, however, the\r\nfraternal harmony is not so perfect as it might be: the owl is accused\r\nof occasionally gratifying his carnivorous lusts by laying open the\r\nskull of Wish-ton-Wish with a smart stroke of the beak. We sighted,\r\nnot far from the prairie-dog village, an animal which I took to be a\r\nlynx; but the driver, who had often seen the beast in Minnesota and Old\r\n“Ouisconsinc,” declared that they are not to be found here.\r\n\r\n  [40] The name will recall to mind one of Mr. Fennimore Cooper’s\r\n  admirable fictions, the “Wept of Wish-ton-Wish,” which was, however,\r\n  a bird, the “Whip-poor-will,” or American night-hawk.\r\n\r\nAt 12 45 P.M., traveling over the uneven barren, and in a burning\r\nsirocco, we reached Lodge-Pole Station, where we made our “noonin.” The\r\nhovel fronting the creek was built like an Irish shanty, or a Beloch\r\nhut, against a hill side, to save one wall, and it presented a fresh\r\nphase of squalor and wretchedness. The mud walls were partly papered\r\nwith “Harper’s Magazine,” “Frank Leslie,” and the “New York Illustrated\r\nNews;” the ceiling was a fine festoon-work of soot, and the floor was\r\nmuch like the ground outside, only not nearly so clean. In a corner\r\nstood the usual “bunk,”[41] a mass of mingled rags and buffalo robes;\r\nthe centre of the room was occupied by a rickety table, and boxes,\r\nturned up on their long sides, acted as chairs. The unescapable stove\r\nwas there, filling the interior with the aroma of meat. As usual, the\r\nmaterials for ablution, a “dipper” or cup, a dingy tin skillet of\r\nscanty size, a bit of coarse gritty soap, and a public towel, like a\r\nrag of gunny bag, were deposited upon a rickety settle outside.\r\n\r\n  [41] American writers derive this word from the Anglo-Saxon _benc_,\r\n  whence the modern English “bench.” It means a wooden case used in\r\n  country taverns and in offices, and serving alike for a seat during\r\n  the day and a bed at night. In towns it is applied to the tiers of\r\n  standing bed peculiar to the lowest class of lodging-houses. In the\r\n  West, it is a frame-work, in size and shape like a berth on board\r\n  ship, sometimes single, sometimes double or treble.\r\n\r\n[THE ANTELOPE.]\r\n\r\nThere being no “lady” at the station on Lodge-Pole Creek, milk was\r\nunprocurable. Here, however, began a course of antelope venison, which\r\nsoon told upon us with damaging effect. I well knew the consequences\r\nof this heating and bilious diet in Asia and Africa; but thinking it\r\nsafe to do at Rome as the Romans do, I followed in the wake of my\r\ncompanions, and suffered with them. Like other wild meats, bear, deer,\r\nelk, and even buffalo, antelope will disagree with a stranger; it is,\r\nhowever, juicy, fat, and well-flavored, especially when compared with\r\nthe hard, dry, stringy stuff which the East affords; and the hunter and\r\ntrapper, like the Indian, are loud in its praise.\r\n\r\nThe habitat of the prong-horn antelope (_Antelocapra Americana_, called\r\n“le cabris” by the Canadian, and “the goat” by the unpoetic mountain\r\nman) extends from the plains west of the Missouri to the Pacific Ocean;\r\nit is also abundant on Minnesota and on the banks of the Red River;\r\nits southern limit is Northern Mexico, whence it ranges to 53° N. lat.\r\non the Saskatchewan. It is about the size of a small deer, the male\r\nweighing 65 lbs. in good condition. The coat is coarse and wiry, yellow\r\ndun on the back, with dull white under the belly, and the tanned skin\r\nis worth three dollars. It is at once the fleetest and the wariest\r\nanimal on the prairies, and its sense of hearing as acute as its power\r\nof smell. The best time for “still hunting” (_i.e._, stalking) is at\r\nearly dawn, when the little herds of four or five are busy grazing.\r\nThey disappear during the midday heats of summer, and in the evening,\r\nas in India and Arabia, they are wild and wary. They assemble in\r\nlarger bodies near the Rocky Mountains, where pasturage--not sage,\r\nwhich taints the meat--abounds, and the Indian savages kill them by\r\nsurrounds, especially in winter, when the flesh is fattest. White men\r\nusually stalk them. During the migration season few are seen near the\r\nroad; at other times they are often sighted. They are gifted, like\r\nthe hippopotamus, with a truly feminine curiosity; they will stand\r\nfor minutes to stare at a red wagon-bed, and, despite their extreme\r\nwariness, they will often approach, within shot, a scarlet kerchief\r\ntied to a stick, or any similar decoy. In manner they much resemble\r\nthe Eastern gazelle. When the herd is disturbed, the most timid moves\r\noff first, followed by the rest; the walk gradually increases from a\r\nslow trot to a bounding gallop. At times they halt, one by one, and\r\nturn to gaze, but they presently resume flight, till they reach some\r\nprominent place where their keen vision can command the surrounding\r\ncountry. When well roused, they are thoroughly on the alert; the hunter\r\nwill often find that, though he has moved toward them silently, up the\r\nwind and under cover, they have suspected sinister intentions and have\r\nshifted ground.\r\n\r\nBesides the antelope, there are three species of deer in the regions\r\neast of the Rocky Mountains. Perhaps the most common is the red\r\ndeer of the Eastern States (_Cervus Virginianus_; _le chevreuil_):\r\nit extends almost throughout the length of the continent, and is\r\nseemingly independent of altitude as of latitude. The venison is not\r\nconsidered equal to that of the antelope; travelers, however, kill off\r\nthe deer to save butchers’ bills, so that it is now seldom “glimpsed”\r\nfrom the line of route. The black-tailed or long-eared deer (_Cervus\r\nmacrotis_) is confined to the higher ground; it has similar habits\r\nto the red variety, and is hunted in the same way. The long-tailed,\r\nor jumping deer (_Cervus leucrurus_, vulgarly called the roebuck),\r\naffects, like the black-tailed, the Rocky Mountains. The elk (_Cervus\r\nCanadensis_) is found in parts of Utah Territory and forty miles north\r\nof the mail-road, near the Wind-River Mountains--a perfect paradise\r\nfor sportsmen. It is noble shooting, but poor eating as the Indian\r\nsambar.[42] The moose (_Cervus Alces_), the giant of the deer kind,\r\nsometimes rising seventeen hands high, and weighing 1200 lbs., is an\r\ninhabitant of higher latitudes--Nova Scotia, Canada, Maine, and other\r\nparts of New England.\r\n\r\n  [42] The elk is being domesticated in the State of New York; it is\r\n  still, however, doubtful whether the animals will fatten well or\r\n  supply milk, or serve for other than ornamental purposes.\r\n\r\nAt Lodge-Pole Station, the mules, as might be expected from animals\r\nallowed to run wild every day in the week except one, were like\r\nnewly-caught mustangs.[43] The herdsman--each station boasts of this\r\nofficial--mounted a nag barebacked, and, jingling a bell, drove the\r\ncattle into the corral, a square of twenty yards, formed by a wall\r\nof loose stones, four to five feet high. He wasted three quarters of\r\nan hour in this operation, which a well-trained shepherd’s dog would\r\nhave performed in a few minutes. Then two men entering with lassos\r\nor lariats, thongs of flexible plaited or twisted hide, and provided\r\nwith an iron ring at one end to form the noose--the best are made of\r\nhemp, Russian, not Manilla--proceeded, in a great “muss” on a small\r\nscale, to secure their victims. The lasso[44] in their hands was by no\r\nmeans the “unerring necklace” which the Mexican _vaquéro_ has taught\r\nit to be: they often missed their aim, or caught the wrong animal.\r\nThe effect, however, was magical: a single haul at the noose made the\r\nmost stiff-necked mule tame as a costermonger’s ass. The team took,\r\nas usual, a good hour to trap and hitch up: the latter was a delicate\r\noperation, for the beasts were comically clever with their hoofs.\r\n\r\n  [43] The mustang is the Spanish mesteño. The animal was introduced\r\n  by the first colonists, and allowed to run at large. Its great\r\n  variety of coat proves the mustang’s degeneracy from the tame horse;\r\n  according to travelers, cream-color, skewbald, and piebald being not\r\n  uncommon. “Sparing in diet, a stranger to grain, easily satisfied\r\n  whether on growing or dead grass, inured to all weathers, and capable\r\n  of great labor,” the mustang-pony is a treasure to the prairie-man.\r\n\r\n  [44] According to Mr. Bartlett, the lasso (Span., “lazo”) is\r\n  synonymous with “lariat” (Span. “lariata”). In common use, however,\r\n  the first word is confined to the rope with which buffaloes,\r\n  mustangs, or mules are caught; the second, which in the West is\r\n  popularly pronounced “lariet,” or “lariette,” more generally means\r\n  the article with which animals are picketed. Many authors, however,\r\n  have made “lariat” the equivalent of “lasso.” The Texans use, instead\r\n  of the hide lasso, a hair rope called “caberes,” from the Spanish\r\n  “cabestro,” a halter.\r\n\r\n[CLOUDS OF GRASSHOPPERS.]\r\n\r\nAt 3 P.M., after a preliminary ringing, intended to soothe the fears of\r\nMadame, we set out _au grand galop_, with a team that had never worked\r\ntogether before. They dashed down the cahues with a violence that\r\ntossed us as in a blanket, and nothing could induce them, while fresh,\r\nto keep the path. The yawing of the vehicle was ominous: fortunately,\r\nhowever, the road, though self-made, was excellent; the sides were\r\nsmooth, and the whole country fit to be driven over. At first the view\r\nwas sadly monotonous. It was a fair specimen of the rolling prairie,\r\nin nowise differing from any other land except in the absence of\r\ntrees. According to some travelers, there is in several places an\r\napparently progressive decay of the timber, showing that formerly it\r\nwas more extensive than it is now. Others attribute the phenomenon\r\nto the destruction of forests in a former era by fires or by the\r\naborigines. It is more satisfactory to account for it by a complication\r\nof causes--a want of proper constituents, an insufficiency of rain,\r\nthe depth of the water below the surface, the severity of the eight\r\nmonths of winter snow, the fierce winds--the hardiest growths that\r\npresent their heads above the level of the prairies have dead tops--the\r\nshortness of the summers, and last, but not least, the clouds of\r\ngrasshoppers. According to Lieutenant Warren, whose graphic description\r\nis here borrowed, these insects are “nearly the same as the locusts of\r\nEgypt; and no one who has not traveled on the prairie, and seen for\r\nhimself, can appreciate the magnitude of the swarms. Often they fill\r\nthe air for many miles of extent, so that an inexperienced eye can\r\nscarcely distinguish their appearance from that of a shower of rain or\r\nthe smoke of a prairie fire. The height of their flight may be somewhat\r\nappreciated, as Mr. E. James saw them above his head, as far as their\r\nsize would render them visible, while standing on the top of a peak of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains, 8500 feet above the plain, and an elevation of\r\n14,500 above that of the sea, in the region where the snow lies all the\r\nyear. To a person standing in one of these swarms as they pass over and\r\naround him, the air becomes sensibly darkened, and the sound produced\r\nby their wings resembles that of the passage of a train of cars on a\r\nrailroad when standing two or three hundred yards from the track. The\r\nMormon settlements have suffered more from the ravages of these insects\r\nthan probably all other causes combined. They destroyed nearly all the\r\nvegetables cultivated last year at Fort Randall, and extended their\r\nravages east as far as Iowa.”\r\n\r\nAs we advanced, the horizon, every where within musket-shot--a\r\nwearying sight!--widened out, and the face of the country notably\r\nchanged. A scrap of blue distance and high hills--the “Court-house”\r\nand others--appeared to the northwest. The long, curved lines, the\r\ngentle slopes, and the broad hollows of the divide facing the South\r\nFork changed into an abrupt and precipitous descent, “gullied” like the\r\nbroken ground of sub-ranges attached to a mountain chain. Deep ravines\r\nwere parted by long narrow ridges, sharp-crested and water-washed,\r\nexposing ribs and backbones of sandstone and silicious lime, like the\r\nvertebræ of some huge saurian: scatters of kunker, with a detritus of\r\nquartz and granite, clothed the ground, and, after passing Lodge-Pole\r\nCreek, which bears away to the west, the rocky steps required the\r\nperpetual application of the brake. Presently we saw a dwarf cliff\r\ninclosing in an elliptical sweep a green amphitheatre, the valley of\r\nour old friend the Platte. On the far bank of its northern fork lay a\r\nforty-mile stretch of sandy, barren, glaring, heat-reeking ground, not\r\nunlike that which the overland traveler looking southward from Suez\r\nsees.[45] We left far to the right a noted spot, Ash Hollow, situated\r\nat the mouth of the creek of the same prenomen. It is described as a\r\npretty bit in a barren land, about twenty acres, surrounded by high\r\nbluffs, well timbered with ash and cedar, and rich in clematis and\r\nother wild flowers. Here, in 1855, the doughty General Harney, with\r\n700 to 800 men, “gave Jessie” to a large war-party of Brûlé Sioux\r\nunder their chief Little Thunder, of whom more anon, killing 150, and\r\ncapturing 60 squaws and children, with but seven or eight casualties in\r\nhis own force.\r\n\r\n  [45] According to Lieutenant Warren, the tract called the Sand-hills\r\n  occupies an area, north of the Platte, not less than 20,000 square\r\n  miles: from between the Niobrara and White Rivers to the north,\r\n  probably beyond the Arkansas in the south.\r\n\r\n[AN IMPROMPTU BEDROOM.]\r\n\r\nDescending into the bed of a broad “arroyo,”[46] at this season bone\r\ndry, we reached, at 5 45 P.M., Mud-Spring Station, which takes its\r\nname from a little run of clear water in a black miry hollow. A kind\r\nof cress grows in it abundantly, and the banks are bright with the\r\n“morning-glory” or convolvulus. The station-house was not unlike an\r\nEgyptian fellah’s hut. The material was sod, half peat with vegetable\r\nmatter; it is taken up in large flakes after being furrowed with the\r\nplow, and is cut to proper lengths with a short-handled spade. Cedar\r\ntimber,[47] brought from the neighboring hills, formed the roof. The\r\nonly accommodation was an open shed, with a sort of doorless dormitory\r\nby its side. We dined in the shed, and amused ourselves with feeding\r\nthe little brown-speckled swamp-blackbirds that hopped about us tame\r\nand “peert” as wrens, and when night drew near we sought shelter\r\nfrom the furious southern gale, and heard tales of Mormon suffering\r\nwhich made us think lightly of our little hardships.[48] Dreading\r\nthe dormitory--if it be true that the sultan of fleas inhabits Jaffa\r\nand his vizier Grand Cairo, it is certain that his vermin officials\r\nhave settled _pro tem._ on Emigration Road--I cast about for a\r\nquieter retreat. Fortune favored me by pointing out the body of a\r\ndismantled wagon, an article--like the Tyrian keels which suggested\r\nthe magalia--often used as a habitation in the Far West, and not\r\nunfrequently honored by being converted into a bridal-chamber after the\r\nshort and sharp courtship of the “Perraries.” The host, who was a kind,\r\nintelligent, and civil man, lent me a “buffalo” by way of bedding; the\r\nwater-proof completed my outfit, provided with which I bade adieu for\r\na while to this weary world. The thermometer sank before dawn to 62°\r\n(F.). After five nights more or less in the cramping wagon, it might be\r\nsupposed that we should have enjoyed the unusual rest; on the contrary,\r\nwe had become inured to the exercise; we could have kept it up for a\r\nmonth, and we now grumbled only at the loss of time.\r\n\r\n  [46] The Arabo-Spanish “arroyo,” a word almost naturalized by the\r\n  Anglo-Americans, exactly corresponds with the Italian “fiumara” and\r\n  the Indian nullah.\r\n\r\n  [47] The word “cedar,” in the United States, is applied to various\r\n  genera of the pine family. The red cedar (_J. Virginiana_) is a\r\n  juniper. The “white cedar” of the Southern swamps is a cypress.\r\n\r\n  [48] The Mormon emigrants usually start from Council Bluffs, on\r\n  the left bank of the Missouri River, in N. lat, 41° 18′ 50″,\r\n  opposite Kanesville, otherwise called Winter Quarters. According\r\n  to the “Overland Guide,” Council Bluffs is the natural crossing of\r\n  the Missouri River, on the route destined by Nature for the great\r\n  thoroughfare to the Pacific. This was the road selected by “Nature’s\r\n  civil engineers,” the buffalo and the elk, for their western travel.\r\n  The Indians followed them in the same trail; then the travelers; next\r\n  the settlers came. After ninety-four miles’ marching, the Mormons\r\n  are ferried across Loup Fork, a stream thirteen rods wide, full of\r\n  bars, with banks and a bottom all quicksand. Another 150 miles takes\r\n  them to the Platte River, where they find good camping-places, with\r\n  plenty of water, buffalo-chips, and grass. Eighty-two miles beyond\r\n  that point (a total of 306), they arrive at “Last Timber,” a station\r\n  so called because, for the next 300 miles on the north side of the\r\n  Platte, the only sign of vegetation is “Lone Tree.” Many emigrants\r\n  avoid this dreary “spell” by crossing the Platte opposite Ash Hollow.\r\n  Others pass it at Platte-River Ferry, a short distance below the\r\n  mouth of Laramie River, while others keep the old road to the north.\r\n\r\n  _Past the Court-house and Scott’s Bluffs. August 13th._\r\n\r\nAt 8 A.M., after breaking our fast upon a tough antelope steak, and\r\ndawdling while the herdsman was riding wildly about in search of his\r\nrunaway mules--an operation now to become of daily occurrence--we\r\ndashed over the Sandy Creek with an _élan_ calculated to make timid\r\npassengers look “skeery,” and began to finish the rolling divide\r\nbetween the two forks. We crossed several arroyos and “criks” heading\r\nin the line of clay highlands to our left, a dwarf sierra which\r\nstretches from the northern to the southern branch of the Platte. The\r\nprincipal are Omaha Creek, more generally known as “Little Punkin,”[49]\r\nand Lawrence Fork.[50] The latter is a pretty bubbling stream,\r\nrunning over sand and stones washed down from the Court-house Ridge;\r\nit bifurcates above the ford, runs to the northeast through a prairie\r\nfour to five miles broad, and swells the waters of old Father Platte:\r\nit derives its name from a Frenchman slaughtered by the Indians,\r\nmurder being here, as in Central Africa, ever the principal source of\r\nnomenclature. The heads of both streams afford quantities of currants,\r\nred, black, and yellow, and cherry-sticks which are used for spears and\r\npipe-stems.\r\n\r\n  [49] Punkin (_i.e._, pumpkin) and corn (_i.e._, zea maize) are, and\r\n  were from time immemorial, the great staples of native American\r\n  agriculture.\r\n\r\n  [50] According to Webster, “forks” (in the plural)--the point where\r\n  a river divides, or rather where two rivers meet and unite in one\r\n  stream. Each branch is called a “fork.” The word might be useful to\r\n  English travelers.\r\n\r\nAfter twelve miles’ drive we fronted the Court-house, the remarkable\r\nportal of a new region, and this new region teeming with wonders\r\nwill now extend about 100 miles. It is the _mauvaises terres_, or\r\nBad lands, a tract about 60 miles wide and 150 long, stretching in a\r\ndirection from the northeast to the southwest, or from the Mankizitah\r\n(White-Earth) River, over the Niobrara (_Eau qui court_) and Loup\r\nFork to the south banks of the Platte: its eastern limit is the mouth\r\nof the Keya Paha. The term is generally applied by the trader to any\r\nsection of the prairie country where the roads are difficult, and\r\nby dint of an ill name the Bad lands have come to be spoken of as a\r\nGolgotha, white with the bones of man and beast. American travelers,\r\non the contrary, declare that near parts of the White River “some as\r\nbeautiful valleys are to be found as any where in the Far West,” and\r\nthat many places “abound in the most lovely and varied forms in endless\r\nvariety, giving the most striking and pleasing effects of light and\r\nshade.” The formation is the pliocene and miocene tertiary, uncommonly\r\nrich in vertebrate remains: the _mauvaises terres_ are composed of\r\nnearly horizontal strata, and “though diversified by the effects of\r\ndenuding agencies, and presenting in different portions striking\r\ncharacteristics, yet they are, as a whole, a great uniform surface,\r\ngradually rising toward the mountains, at the base of which they attain\r\nan elevation varying between 3000 and 5500 feet above the level of the\r\nsea.”\r\n\r\nThe Court-house, which had lately suffered from heavy rain, resembled\r\nany thing more than a court-house; that it did so in former days we\r\nmay gather from the tales of many travelers, old Canadian voyageurs,\r\nwho unanimously accounted it a fit place for Indian spooks, ghosts,\r\nand hobgoblins to meet in powwow, and to “count their coups” delivered\r\nin the flesh. The Court-house lies about eight miles from the river,\r\nand three from the road; in circumference it may be half a mile, and\r\nin height 300 feet; it is, however, gradually degrading, and the rains\r\nand snows of not many years will lay it level with the ground. The\r\nmaterial is a rough conglomerate of hard marl; the mass is apparently\r\nthe flank or shoulder of a range forming the southern buttress of the\r\nPlatte, and which, being composed of softer stuff, has gradually\r\nmelted away, leaving this remnant to rise in solitary grandeur above\r\nthe plain. In books it is described as resembling a gigantic ruin, with\r\na huge rotunda in front, windows in the sides, and remains of roofs\r\nand stages in its flanks: verily potent is the eye of imagination! To\r\nme it appeared in the shape of an irregular pyramid, whose courses\r\nwere inclined at an ascendable angle of 35°, with a detached outwork\r\ncomposed of a perpendicular mass based upon a slope of 45°; in fact,\r\nit resembled the rugged earthworks of Sakkara, only it was far more\r\nrugged. According to the driver, the summit is a plane upon which a\r\nwagon can turn. My military companion remarked that it would make a\r\nfine natural fortress against Indians, and perhaps, in the old days\r\nof romance and Colonel Bonneville, it has served as a refuge for the\r\nharried fur-hunter. I saw it when set off by weather to advantage. A\r\nblazing sun rained fire upon its cream-colored surface--at 11 A.M.\r\nthe glass showed 95° in the wagon--and it stood boldly out against\r\na purple-black nimbus which overspread the southern skies, growling\r\ndistant thunders, and flashing red threads of “chained lightning.”\r\n\r\n[THE COMPATRIOT.]\r\n\r\nI had finished a hasty sketch, when suddenly appeared to us a most\r\ninteresting sight--a neat ambulance,[51] followed by a fourgon and\r\nmounted soldiers, from which issued an officer in uniform, who\r\nadvanced to greet Lieutenant Dana. The traveler was Captain, or rather\r\nMajor Marcy, who was proceeding westward on leave of absence. After\r\nintroduction, he remembered that his vehicle contained a compatriot\r\nof mine. The compatriot, whose length of facial hair at once told his\r\nrace--for\r\n\r\n    “The larger the whisker, the greater the Tory”--\r\n\r\nwas a Mr. A----, British vice-consul at * * *’s, Minnesota. Having\r\nlately tried his maiden hand upon buffalo, he naturally concluded that\r\nI could have no other but the same object. Pleasant estimate, forsooth,\r\nof a man’s brain, that it can find nothing in America worthy of its\r\nnotice but bison-shooting! However, the supposition had a _couleur\r\nlocale_. Every week the New York papers convey to the New World the\r\ninteresting information that some distinguished Britisher has crossed\r\nthe Atlantic and half crossed the States to enjoy the society of the\r\n“monarch of our prairies.” Americans consequently have learned to look\r\nupon this Albionic eccentricity as “the thing.” That unruly member the\r\ntongue was upon the point of putting in a something about the earnest,\r\nsettled purpose of shooting a prairie-dog, when the reflection that it\r\nwas hardly fair so far from home to “chaff” a compatriot evidently big\r\nwith the paternity of a great exploit, with bit and bridle curbed it\r\nfast.\r\n\r\n  [51] The price of the strong light traveling wagon called an\r\n  ambulance in the West is about $250; in the East it is much cheaper.\r\n  With four mules it will vary from $750 to $900; when resold,\r\n  however, it rarely fetches half that sum. A journey between St.\r\n  Joseph and Great Salt Lake City can easily be accomplished in an\r\n  ambulance within forty days. Officers and sportsmen prefer it,\r\n  because they have their time to themselves, and they can carry stores\r\n  and necessaries. On the other hand, “strikers”--soldier-helps--or\r\n  Canadian _engagés_ are necessary; and the pleasure of traveling is by\r\n  no means enhanced by the nightly fear that the stock will “bolt,” not\r\n  to be recovered for a week, if then.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHIMNEY ROCK.]\r\n\r\nShortly after “liquoring up” and shaking hands, we found ourselves once\r\nmore in the valley of the Platte, where a lively green relieved eyes\r\nwhich still retained retina-pictures of the barren, Sindh-like divide.\r\nThe road, as usual along the river-side, was rough and broken, and\r\npuffs of simoom raised the sand and dust in ponderous clouds. At 12\r\n30 P.M. we nooned for an hour at a little hovel called a ranch, with\r\nthe normal corral; and I took occasion to sketch the far-famed Chimney\r\nRock. The name is not, as is that of the Court-house, a misnomer: one\r\nmight almost expect to see smoke or steam jetting from the summit. Like\r\nmost of these queer malformations, it was once the knuckle-end of the\r\nmain chain which bounded the Platte Valley; the softer adjacent strata\r\nof marl and earthy limestone were disintegrated by wind and weather,\r\nand the harder material, better resisting the action of air and water,\r\nhas gradually assumed its present form. Chimney Rock lies two and a\r\nhalf miles from the south bank of the Platte. It is composed of a\r\nfriable yellowish marl, yielding readily to the knife. The shape is a\r\nthin shaft, perpendicular and quasi conical. Viewed from the southeast\r\nit is not unlike a giant jack-boot based upon a high pyramidal mound,\r\nwhich, disposed in the natural slope, rests upon the plain. The neck of\r\nsandstone connecting it with the adjacent hills has been distributed\r\nby the floods around the base, leaving an ever-widening gap between.\r\nThis “Pharos of the prairie sea” towered in former days 150 to 200\r\nfeet above the apex of its foundation,[52] and was a landmark visible\r\nfor 40 to 50 miles: it is now barely 35 feet in height. It has often\r\nbeen struck by lightning; _imber edax_ has gnawed much away, and the\r\nbeginning of the end is already at hand. It is easy to ascend the\r\npyramid; but, while Pompey’s Pillar, Peter Botte, and Ararat have all\r\nfelt the Anglo-Scandinavian foot, no venturous scion of the race has\r\nyet trampled upon the top of Chimney Rock. Around the waist of the base\r\nruns a white band which sets off its height and relieves the uniform\r\ntint. The old sketches of this curious needle now necessarily appear\r\nexaggerated; moreover, those best known represent it as a column rising\r\nfrom a confused heap of boulders, thus conveying a completely false\r\nidea. Again the weather served us: nothing could be more picturesque\r\nthan this lone pillar of pale rock lying against a huge black cloud,\r\nwith the forked lightning playing over its devoted head.\r\n\r\n  [52] According to M. Preuss, who accompanied Colonel Frémont’s\r\n  expedition, “travelers who visited it some years since placed its\r\n  height at upward of 500 feet,” though in his day (1842) it had\r\n  diminished to 200 feet above the river.\r\n\r\n[ROBIDOUX’ FORT.]\r\n\r\nAfter a frugal dinner of biscuit and cheese we remounted and pursued\r\nour way through airy fire, which presently changed from our usual\r\npest--a light dust-laden breeze--into a Punjaubian dust-storm, up the\r\nvalley of the Platte. We passed a ranch called “Robidoux’ Fort,” from\r\nthe well-known Indian trader of that name;[53] it is now occupied by\r\na Canadian or a French Creole, who, as usual with his race in these\r\nregions, has taken to himself a wife in the shape of a Sioux squaw,\r\nand has garnished his quiver with a multitude of whitey-reds. The\r\ndriver pointed out the grave of a New Yorker who had vainly visited\r\nthe prairies in search of a cure for consumption. As we advanced the\r\nstorm increased to a tornado of north wind, blinding our cattle till\r\nit drove them off the road. The gale howled through the pass with all\r\nthe violence of a khamsin, and it was followed by lightning and a few\r\nheavy drops of rain. The threatening weather caused a large party of\r\nemigrants to “fort themselves” in a corral near the base of Scott’s\r\nBluffs.\r\n\r\nThe corral, a Spanish and Portuguese word, which, corrupted to “kraal,”\r\nhas found its way through Southern Africa, signifies primarily a square\r\nor circular pen for cattle, which may be made of tree-trunks, stones,\r\nor any other convenient material. The corral of wagons is thus formed.\r\nThe two foremost are brought near and parallel to each other, and are\r\nfollowed by the rest, disposed aslant, so that the near fore wheel of\r\nthe hinder touches the off hind wheel of that preceding it, and _vice\r\nversâ_ on the other side. The “tongues,” or poles, are turned outward,\r\nfor convenience of yoking, when an attack is not expected, otherwise\r\nthey are made to point inward, and the gaps are closed by ropes and\r\nyoke and spare chains. Thus a large oval is formed with a single\r\nopening fifteen to twenty yards across; some find it more convenient\r\nto leave an exit at both ends. In dangerous places the passages are\r\nsecured at night either by cords or by wheeling round the near wagons;\r\nthe cattle are driven in before sundown, especially when the area of\r\nthe oval is large enough to enable them to graze, and the men sleep\r\nunder their vehicles. In safer travel the tents are pitched outside the\r\ncorral with their doors outward, and in front of these the camp-fires\r\nare lighted. The favorite spots with teamsters for corraling are the\r\nre-entering angles of deep streams, especially where these have high\r\nand precipitous banks, or the crests of abrupt hills and bluffs--the\r\nposition for nighting usually chosen by the Australian traveler--where\r\none or more sides of the encampment is safe from attack, and the others\r\ncan be protected by a cross fire. As a rule Indians avoid attacking\r\nstrong places; this, however, must not always be relied upon; in 1844\r\nthe Utah Indians attacked Uintah Fort, a trading-post belonging to\r\nM. A. Robidoux, then at St. Louis, slaughtered the men, and carried\r\noff the women. The corral is especially useful for two purposes: it\r\nenables the wagoners to yoke up with ease, and it secures them from the\r\nprairie traveler’s prime dread--the stampede. The Western savages are\r\nperfectly acquainted with the habits of animals, and in their marauding\r\nexpeditions they instinctively adopt the system of the Bedouins, the\r\nGallas, and the Somal. Providing themselves with rattles and other\r\nimplements for making startling noises, they ride stealthily up close\r\nto the cattle, and then rush by like the whirlwind with a volley of\r\nhorrid whoops and screams. When the “cavallard” flies in panic fear,\r\nthe plunderers divide their party; some drive on the plunder, while the\r\nothers form a rear-guard to keep off pursuers. The prairie-men provide\r\nfor the danger by keeping their fleetest horses saddled, bridled,\r\nand ready to be mounted at a moment’s notice. When the animals have\r\nstampeded, the owners follow them, scatter the Indians, and drive,\r\nif possible, the madriña, or bell-mare, to the front of the herd,\r\ngradually turning her toward the camp, and slacking speed as the\r\nfamiliar objects come in sight. Horses and mules appear peculiarly\r\ntimorous upon the prairies. A band of buffalo, a wolf, or even a deer,\r\nwill sometimes stampede them; they run to great distances, and not\r\nunfrequently their owners fail to recover them.\r\n\r\n  [53] From the _St. Joseph_ (Mo.) _Gazette_: “Obituary.--Departed\r\n  this life, at his residence in this city, on Wednesday, the 29th\r\n  day of August, 1860, after a long illness, Antoine Robidoux, in\r\n  the sixty-sixth year of his age. Mr. Robidoux was born in the city\r\n  of St. Louis, in the year 1794. He was one of the brothers of Mr.\r\n  Joseph Robidoux, founder of the city of St. Joseph. He was possessed\r\n  of a sprightly intellect and a spirit of adventure. When not more\r\n  than twenty-two years of age he accompanied Gen. Atkinson to the\r\n  then very wild and distant region of the Yellow Stone. At the age of\r\n  twenty-eight he went to Mexico, and lived there fifteen years. He\r\n  then married a very interesting Mexican lady, who returned with him\r\n  to the States. For many years he traded extensively with the Navajoes\r\n  and Apaches. In 1840 he came to this city with his family, and has\r\n  resided here ever since. In 1845 he went out to the mountains on a\r\n  trading expedition, and was caught by the most terrible storms, which\r\n  caused the death of one or two hundred of his horses, and stopped his\r\n  progress. His brother Joseph, the respectable founder of this city,\r\n  sent to his relief and had him brought in, or he would have perished.\r\n  He was found in a most deplorable condition, and saved. In 1846 he\r\n  accompanied Gen. Kearney, as interpreter and guide, to Mexico. In\r\n  a battle with the Mexicans he was lanced severely in three places,\r\n  but he survived his wounds, and returned to St. Joseph in 1849. Soon\r\n  after that he went to California, and remained until 1854. In 1855\r\n  he removed to New Mexico with his family, and in 1856 he went to\r\n  Washington, and remained there a year, arranging some business with\r\n  the government. He then returned to St. Joseph, and has remained here\r\n  ever since. Mr. Robidoux was a very remarkable man. Tall, slender,\r\n  athletic, and agile, he possessed the most graceful and pleasing\r\n  manners, and an intellect of a superior order. In every company he\r\n  was affable, graceful, and highly pleasing. His conversation was\r\n  always interesting and instructive, and he possessed many of those\r\n  qualities which, if he remained in the States, would have raised him\r\n  to positions of distinction. He suffered for several years before\r\n  his death with a terrible soreness of the eyes, which defied the\r\n  curative skill of the doctors; and for the past ten years he has been\r\n  afflicted with dropsy. A week or two ago he was taken with a violent\r\n  hemorrhage of the lungs, which completely prostrated him, and from\r\n  the effects of which he never recovered. He was attended by the best\r\n  medical skill, and his wife and many friends were with him to the\r\n  hour of his dissolution, which occurred on Monday morning, at four\r\n  o’clock, at his residence in this city. He will be long remembered as\r\n  a courteous, cultivated, agreeable gentleman, whose life was one of\r\n  great activity and public usefulness, and whose death will be long\r\n  lamented.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCOTT’S BLUFFS.]\r\n\r\n[SCOTT’S BLUFFS.]\r\n\r\n“Scott’s Bluffs,” situated 285 miles from Fort Kearney and 51 from Fort\r\nLaramie, was the last of the great marl formations which we saw on this\r\nline, and was of all by far the most curious. In the dull uniformity\r\nof the prairies, it is a striking and attractive object, far excelling\r\nthe castled crag of Drachenfels or any of the beauties of romantic\r\nRhine. From a distance of a day’s march it appears in the shape of\r\na large blue mound, distinguished only by its dimensions from the\r\ndetached fragments of hill around. As you approach within four or five\r\nmiles, a massive medieval city gradually defines itself, clustering,\r\nwith a wonderful fullness of detail, round a colossal fortress, and\r\ncrowned with a royal castle. Buttress and barbican, bastion, demilune,\r\nand guard-house, tower, turret, and donjon-keep, all are there: in\r\none place parapets and battlements still stand upon the crumbling\r\nwall of a fortalice like the giant ruins of Château Gaillard, the\r\n“Beautiful Castle on the Rock;” and, that nothing may be wanting to the\r\nresemblance, the dashing rains and angry winds have cut the old line of\r\nroad at its base into a regular moat with a semicircular sweep, which\r\nthe mirage fills with a mimic river. Quaint figures develop themselves;\r\nguards and sentinels in dark armor keep watch and ward upon the slopes,\r\nthe lion of Bastia crouches unmistakably overlooking the road; and as\r\nthe shades of an artificial evening, caused by the dust-storm, close\r\nin, so weird is its aspect that one might almost expect to see some\r\nspectral horseman, with lance and pennant, go his rounds about the\r\ndeserted streets, ruined buildings, and broken walls. At a nearer\r\naspect again, the quaint illusion vanishes; the lines of masonry become\r\nyellow layers of boulder and pebble imbedded in a mass of stiff,\r\ntamped, bald marly clay; the curtains and angles change to the gashings\r\nof the rains of ages, and the warriors are metamorphosed into dwarf\r\ncedars and dense shrubs, scattered singly over the surface. Travelers\r\nhave compared this glory of the _mauvaises terres_ to Gibraltar, to the\r\nCapitol at Washington, to Stirling Castle. I could think of nothing in\r\nits presence but the Arabs’ “City of Brass,” that mysterious abode of\r\nbewitched infidels, which often appears at a distance to the wayfarer\r\ntoiling under the burning sun, but ever eludes his nearer search.\r\n\r\nScott’s Bluffs derive their name from an unfortunate fur-trader there\r\nput on shore in the olden time by his boat’s crew, who had a grudge\r\nagainst him: the wretch, in mortal sickness, crawled up the mound to\r\ndie. The politer guide-books call them “Capitol Hills:” methinks the\r\nfirst name, with its dark associations, must be better pleasing to\r\nthe _genius loci_. They are divided into three distinct masses. The\r\nlargest, which may be 800 feet high, is on the right, or nearest the\r\nriver. To its left lies an outwork, a huge, detached cylinder whose\r\ncapping changes aspect from every direction; and still farther to the\r\nleft is a second castle, now divided from, but once connected with the\r\nothers. The whole affair is a spur springing from the main range, and\r\nclosing upon the Platte so as to leave no room for a road.\r\n\r\n[METEOROLOGICAL PHENONMENON.]\r\n\r\nAfter gratifying our curiosity we resumed our way. The route lay\r\nbetween the right-hand fortress and the outwork, through a degraded\r\nbed of softer marl, once doubtless part of the range. The sharp,\r\nsudden torrents which pour from the heights on both sides, and the\r\ndraughty winds--Scott’s Bluffs are the permanent head-quarters of\r\nhurricanes--have cut up the ground into a labyrinth of jagged gulches\r\nsteeply walled in. We dashed down the drains and pitch-holes with\r\na violence which shook the nave-bands from our sturdy wheels.[54]\r\nAscending, the driver showed a place where the skeleton of an\r\n“elephant” had been lately discovered. On the summit he pointed out,\r\nfar over many a treeless hill and barren plain, the famous Black Hills\r\nand Laramie Peak, which has been compared to Ben Lomond, towering at\r\na distance of eighty miles. The descent was abrupt, with sudden turns\r\nround the head of earth-cracks deepened to ravines by snow and rain;\r\nand one place showed the remains of a wagon and team which had lately\r\ncome to grief. After galloping down a long slope of twelve miles, with\r\nridgelets of sand and gravel somewhat raised above the bottom, which\r\nthey cross on their way to the river, we found ourselves, at 5 30 P.M.,\r\nonce more in the valley of the Platte. I had intended to sketch the\r\nBluffs more carefully from the station, but the western view proved\r\nto be disappointingly inferior to the eastern. After the usual hour’s\r\ndelay we resumed our drive through alternate puffs of hot and cold\r\nwind, the contrast of which was not easy to explain. The sensation was\r\nas if Indians had been firing the prairies--an impossibility at this\r\nseason, when whatever herbage there is is still green. It may here be\r\nmentioned that, although the meteorology of the earlier savans, namely,\r\nthat the peculiar condition of the atmosphere known as the Indian\r\nsummer[55] might be produced by the burning of the plain-vegetation,\r\nwas not thought worthy of comment, their hypothesis is no longer\r\nconsidered trivial. The smoky canopy must produce a sensible effect\r\nupon the temperature of the season. “During a still night, when a\r\ncloud of this kind is overhead, no dew is produced; the heat which is\r\nradiated from the earth is reflected or absorbed, and radiated back\r\nagain by the particles of soot, and the coating of the earth necessary\r\nto prevent the deposition of water in the form of dew or hoar-frost is\r\nprevented.” According to Professor Henry, of Washington, “it is highly\r\nprobable that a portion of the smoke or fog-cloud produced by the\r\nburning of one of the Western prairies is carried entirely across the\r\neastern portion of the continent to the ocean.”\r\n\r\n  [54] The dry heat of the prairies in summer causes the wood to warp\r\n  by the percolation of water, which the driver restores by placing the\r\n  wheels for a night to stand in some stream. Paint or varnish is of\r\n  little use. Moisture may be drawn out even through a nail-hole, and\r\n  exhaust the whole interior of the wood-work.\r\n\r\n  [55] These remarks are borrowed from a paper by Professor Joseph\r\n  Henry, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, entitled\r\n  “Meteorology in its Connection with Agriculture.”\r\n\r\nThe Indian summer is synonymous with our St. Martin’s or Allhallows\r\nsummer, so called from the festival held on the 11th of November.\r\n“The Indians avail themselves of this delightful time for harvesting\r\ntheir corn; and the tradition is that they were accustomed to say they\r\nalways had a second summer of nine days before the winter set in. It\r\nis a bland and genial time, in which the birds, insects, and plants\r\nfeel a new creation, and enjoy a short-lived summer ere they shrink\r\nfinally from the rigor of the winter’s blast. The sky, in the mean\r\ntime, is generally filled with a haze of orange and gold, intercepting\r\nthe direct rays of the sun, yet possessing enough of light and heat to\r\nprevent sensations of gloom or chill, while the nights grow sharp and\r\nfrosty, and the necessary fires give cheerful forecast of the social\r\nwinter evenings near at hand.”--The _National Intelligencer_, Nov.\r\n26th, 1857, quoted by Mr. Bartlett.\r\n\r\nPresently we dashed over the Little Kiowa Creek, forded the Horse\r\nCreek, and, enveloped in a cloud of villainous musquetoes, entered\r\nat 8 30 P.M. the station in which we were to pass the night. It was\r\ntenanted by one Reynal, a French Creole--the son of an old soldier of\r\nthe Grand Armée, who had settled at St. Louis--a companionable man,\r\nbut an extortionate: he charged us a florin for every “drink” of his\r\nwell-watered whisky. The house boasted of the usual squaw, a wrinkled\r\nold dame, who at once began to prepare supper, when we discreetly\r\nleft the room. These hard-working but sorely ill-favored beings are\r\naccused of various horrors in cookery, such as grinding their pinole,\r\nor parched corn, in the impurest manner, kneading dough upon the\r\nfloor, using their knives for any purpose whatever, and employing\r\nthe same pot, unwashed, for boiling tea and tripe. In fact, they are\r\nabout as clean as those Eastern pariah servants who make the knowing\r\nAnglo-Indian hold it an abomination to sit at meat with a new arrival\r\nor with an officer of a “home regiment.” The daughter was an unusually\r\nfascinating half-breed, with a pale face and Franco-American features.\r\nHow comes it that here, as in Hindostan, the French half-caste is\r\npretty, graceful, amiable, coquettish, while the Anglo-Saxon is\r\nplain, coarse, gauche, and ill-tempered? The beauty was married to\r\na long, lean down-Easter, who appeared most jealously attentive to\r\nher, occasionally hinting at a return to the curtained bed, where she\r\ncould escape the admiring glances of strangers. Like her mother, she\r\nwas able to speak English, but she could not be persuaded to open her\r\nmouth. This is a truly Indian prejudice, probably arising from the\r\nsavage, childish sensitiveness which dreads to excite a laugh; even a\r\nsquaw married to a white man, after uttering a few words in a moment of\r\n_épanchement_, will hide her face under the blanket.\r\n\r\nThe half-breed has a bad name in the land. Like the negro, the Indian\r\nbelongs to a species, sub-species, or variety--whichever the reader\r\npleases--that has diverged widely enough from the Indo-European\r\ntype to cause degeneracy, physical as well as moral, and often,\r\ntoo, sterility in the offspring. These half-breeds are, therefore,\r\nlike the mulatto, quasi-mules. The men combine the features of both\r\nraces; the skin soon becomes coarse and wrinkled, and the eye is\r\nblack, snaky, and glittering like the Indian’s. The mongrels are\r\nshort-lived, peculiarly subject to infectious diseases, untrustworthy,\r\nand disposed to every villainy. The half-breed women, in early youth,\r\nare sometimes attractive enough, uniting the figure of the mother\r\nto the more delicate American face; a few years, however, deprive\r\nthem of all litheness, grace, and agility. They are often married by\r\nwhites, who hold them to be more modest and humble, less capricious\r\nand less exacting, than those of the higher type: they make good wives\r\nand affectionate mothers, and, like the Quadroons, they are more\r\n“ambitious”--that is to say, of warmer temperaments--than either of the\r\nraces from which they are derived. The so-called red is a higher ethnic\r\ntype than the black man; so, in the United States, where all admixture\r\nof African blood is deemed impure, the aboriginal American entails no\r\ndisgrace--some of the noblest of the land are descended from “Indian\r\nprincesses.” The half-breed girls resemble their mothers in point of\r\nindustry, and they barter their embroidered robes and moccasins, and\r\nmats and baskets, made of bark and bulrush, in exchange for blankets,\r\ncalicoes, glass beads--an indispensable article of dress--mirrors,\r\nneedles, rings, vermilion, and other luxuries. The children, with their\r\nlarge black eyes, wide mouths, and glittering teeth, flattened heads,\r\nand remarkable agility of motion, suggest the idea of little serpents.\r\n\r\nThe day had been fatiguing, and our eyes ached with the wind and dust.\r\nWe lost no time in spreading on the floor the buffalo robes borrowed\r\nfrom the house, and in defying the smaller tenants of the ranch. Our\r\nhost, M. Reynal, was a study, but we deferred the lesson till the next\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n  _To Fort Laramie. 14th August._\r\n\r\n[M. REYNAL.]\r\n\r\nM. Reynal had been an Indian trader in his youth. Of this race there\r\nwere in his day two varieties: the regular trader and the _coureur\r\ndes bois_, or unlicensed peddler, who was subject to certain pains\r\nand penalties. The former had some regard for his future; he had a\r\npermanent interest in the Indians, and looked to the horses, arms, and\r\naccoutrements of his _protégés_, so that hunting might not flag. The\r\n_bois brûlé_ peddler, having--like an English advertising firm--no hope\r\nof dealing twice with the same person, got all he could for what he\r\ncould. These men soon sapped the foundation of the Indian’s discipline.\r\nOne of them, for instance, would take protection with the chief, pay\r\npresents, and by increasing the wealth, enhance the importance of\r\nhis protector. Another would place himself under the charge of some\r\nambitious aspirant to power, who was thus raised to a position of\r\ndirect rivalry. A split would ensue; the weaker would secede with his\r\nfamily and friends, and declare independence; a murder or two would\r\nbe the result, and a blood-feud would be bequeathed from generation\r\nto generation. The licensed traders have ever strenuously opposed the\r\nintroduction of alcohol, a keg of which will purchase from the Indian\r\nevery thing that is his, his arms, lodge, horses, children, and wives.\r\nIn olden times, however, the Maine Liquor Law was not, as now, in force\r\nthrough the territories. The _coureur des bois_, therefore, entered\r\nthe country through various avenues, from the United States and from\r\nMexico, without other stock in trade but some kegs of whisky, which he\r\nretailed at the modest price of $36 per gallon. He usually mixed one\r\npart of fire with five of pure water, and then sold a pint-canful for\r\na buffalo robe. “Indian liquor” became a proverbial term. According\r\nto some travelers, a barrel of “pure Cincinnati,” even after running\r\nthe gauntlet of railroad and lake travel, has afforded a hundred\r\nbarrels of “good Indian liquor.” A small bucketful is poured into\r\na wash-tub of water; a large quantity of “dog-leg” tobacco and red\r\npepper is then added, next a bitter root common in the country is cut\r\nup into it, and finally it is colored with burnt sugar--a nice recipe\r\nfor a morning’s headache! The only drawback to this traffic is its\r\ndanger. The Indian, when intoxicated, is ready for any outrageous act\r\nof violence or cruelty; vinosity brings out the destructiveness and\r\nthe utter barbarity of his character; it makes him thirst tiger-like\r\nfor blood. The _coureur des bois_, therefore, who in those days was\r\nhighly respected, was placed in the Trader’s Lodge, a kind of public\r\nhouse, like the Iwanza of Central Africa, and the village chief took\r\ncare to station at the door a guard of sober youths, sometimes habited\r\nlike Europeans, ready to check the unauthorized attempts of ambitious\r\nclansmen upon the whisky-vendor’s scalp. The Western men, who will\r\nfrequently be alluded to in these pages, may be divided, like the\r\ntraders, into two classes. The first is the true mountaineer, whom the\r\nplatitude and tame monotony of civilized republican life has in early\r\nyouth driven, often from an honored and wealthy family, to the wilds\r\nand wolds, to become the forlorn hope in the march of civilization. The\r\nsecond is the offscouring and refuse of the Eastern cities, compelled\r\nby want, fatuity, or crime to exile himself from all he most loves. The\r\nformer, after passing through the preliminary stage greenhorn, is a man\r\nin every sense of the term: to more than Indian bravery and fortitude,\r\nhe unites the softness of woman, and a child-like simplicity, which is\r\nthe very essence of a chivalrous character; you can read his nature in\r\nhis clear blue eyes, his sun-tanned countenance, his merry smile, and\r\nhis frank, fearless manner. The latter is a knave or a fool; it would\r\nmake “bad blood,” as the Frenchman says, to describe him.\r\n\r\nM. Reynal’s history had to be received with many grains of salt. The\r\nWestern man has been worked by climate and its consequences, by the\r\nhuge magnificence of nature and the violent contrasts of scenery, into\r\na remarkable resemblance to the wild Indian. He hates labor--which poet\r\nand divine combine to deify in the settled states--as the dire effect\r\nof a primeval curse; “loaf” he must and will; to him one hour out of\r\nthe twenty-four spent in honest industry is _satis superque_. His\r\nimagination is inflamed by scenery and climate, difficulty and danger;\r\nhe is as superstitious as an old man-o’-war’s-man of the olden school;\r\nand he is a transcendental liar, like his prototype the aborigine, who\r\nin this point yields nothing to the African negro. I have heard of a\r\nman riding eighty miles--forty into camp and forty out--in order to\r\nenjoy the sweet delights of a lie. His yarns and stories about the land\r\nhe lives in have become a proverbial ridicule; he will tell you that\r\nthe sun rises north of what it did _se puero_; he has seen mountains\r\nof diamonds and gold nuggets scattered like rocks over the surface of\r\nour general mother. I have been gravely told of a herd of bison which\r\narrested the course of the Platte River, causing its waters, like those\r\nof the Red Sea, to stand up, wall fashion, while the animals were\r\ncrossing. Of this Western order is the well-known account of a ride on\r\na buffalo’s horns, delivered for the benefit of a gaping world by a\r\npopular author of the yellow-binding category. In this age, however,\r\nthe Western man has become sensitive to the operation of “smoking.”\r\nA popular Joe Miller anent him is this: A traveler, informed of what\r\nhe might educe by “querying,” asked an old mountaineer, who shall be\r\nnameless, what difference he observed in the country since he had first\r\nsettled in it.\r\n\r\n“Wal, stranger, not much!” was the reply; “only when I fust come here,\r\nthat ’ere mountain,” pointing to the tall Uinta range, “was a hole!”\r\n\r\nDisembarrassing M. Reynal’s recital of its mask of improbabilities and\r\nimpossibilities, remained obvious the naked fact that he had led the\r\nlife of a confirmed _coureur des bois_. The French Canadian and Creole\r\nboth, like the true Français de France, is loth to stir beyond the\r\ndevil-dispelling sound of his chapel-bell; once torn from his _chez\r\nlui_, he apparently cares little to return, and, like the Englishman,\r\nto die at home in his own land. The adventurous Canadians--in whom\r\nextremes meet--have wandered through the length and breadth of the\r\ncontinent; they have left their mark even upon the rocks in Utah\r\nTerritory. M. Reynal had quitted St. Louis at an early age as trader,\r\ntrapper, every thing in short, provided with a little outfit of powder,\r\nball, and whisky. At first he was unfortunate. In a war between the\r\nSioux and the Pawnees, he was taken prisoner by the latter, and with\r\nmuch ado preserved, by the good aid of his squaw, that useful article\r\nhis scalp. Then fickle fortune turned in his favor. He married several\r\nwives, identified himself with the braves, and became a little brother\r\nof the tribe, while his whisky brought him in an abundance of furs\r\nand peltries. After many years, waxing weary of a wandering life, he\r\nsettled down into the somewhat prosaic position in which we had the\r\npleasure of finding him. He was garrulous as a veteran soldier upon the\r\nsubject of his old friends the trappers, that gallant advance guard\r\nwho, sixty years ago, unconsciously fought the fight of civilization\r\nfor the pure love of fighting; who battled with the Indian in his own\r\nway, surpassing him in tracking, surprising, ambuscading, and shooting,\r\nand never failing to raise the enemy’s hair. They are well-nigh\r\nextinct, those old pioneers, wild, reckless, and brave as the British\r\ntar of a century past; they live but in story; their place knows them\r\nno longer; it is now filled by the “prospector.” Civilization and the\r\nsilk hat have exterminated them. How many deeds of stern fight and\r\nheroic endurance have been ignored by this world, which knows nothing\r\nof its greatest men, _carent quia vale sacro_! We talk of Thermopylæ\r\nand ignore Texas; we have all thrilled at the account of the Mameluke\r\nBey’s leap; but how many of us have heard of Major Macculloch’s spring\r\nfrom the cliff?\r\n\r\nOur breakfast was prepared in the usual prairie style. First the\r\ncoffee--three parts burnt beans, which had been duly ground to a\r\nfine powder and exposed to the air, lest the aroma should prove too\r\nstrong for us--was placed on the stove to simmer till every noxious\r\nprinciple was duly extracted from it. Then the rusty bacon, cut into\r\nthick slices, was thrown into the fry-pan: here the gridiron is\r\nunknown, and if known would be little appreciated, because it wastes\r\nthe “drippings,” which form with the staff of life a luxurious sop.\r\nThirdly, antelope steak, cut off a corpse suspended for the benefit\r\nof flies outside, was placed to stew within influence of the bacon’s\r\naroma. Lastly came the bread, which of course should have been “cooked”\r\nfirst. The meal is kneaded with water and a pinch of salt; the raising\r\nis done by means of a little sour milk, or more generally by the\r\ndeleterious yeast-powders of the trade. The carbonic acid gas evolved\r\nby the addition of water must be corrected, and the dough must be\r\nexpanded by saleratus or prepared carbonate of soda or alkali, and\r\nother vile stuff, which communicates to the food the green-yellow\r\ntinge, and suggests many of the properties of poison. A hundred-fold\r\nbetter, the unpretending chapati, flapjack, scone, or, as the Mexicans\r\nprettily called it, “tortilla!” The dough, after being sufficiently\r\nmanipulated upon a long, narrow, smooth board, is divided into\r\n“biscuits” and “dough-nuts,”[56] and finally it is placed to be half\r\ncooked under the immediate influence of the rusty bacon and graveolent\r\nantelope. “Uncle Sam’s stove,” be it said with every reverence for\r\nthe honored name it bears, is a triumph of convenience, cheapness,\r\nunwholesomeness, and nastiness--excuse the word, nice reader. This\r\ntravelers’ bane has exterminated the spit and gridiron, and makes\r\nevery thing taste like its neighbor: by virtue of it, mutton borrows\r\nthe flavor of salmon trout, tomatoes resolve themselves into greens. I\r\nshall lose my temper if the subject is not dropped.\r\n\r\n  [56] The Western “biscuit” is English roll; “cracker” is English\r\n  biscuit. The “dough-nut” is, properly speaking, a “small roundish\r\n  cake, made of flour, eggs, and sugar, moistened with milk and\r\n  boiled in lard” (Webster). On the prairies, where so many different\r\n  materials are unprocurable, it is simply a diminutive loaf, like the\r\n  hot roll of the English passenger steamer.\r\n\r\n[LARAMIE PEAK.]\r\n\r\nWe set out at 6 A.M. over a sandy bottom, from which the musquetoes\r\nrose in swarms. After a twelve-mile stretch the driver pointed out\r\non the right of the road, which here runs between high earth-banks,\r\na spot still infamous in local story. At this place, in 1854, five\r\nIndians, concealing themselves in the bed of a dwarf arroyo, fired\r\nupon the mail-wagon, killing two drivers and one passenger, and then\r\nplundered it of 20,000 dollars. “Long-chin,” the leader, and the other\r\nmurderers, when given up by the tribe, were carried to Washington,\r\nD. C., where--with the ultra-philanthropy which has of modern days\r\ndistinguished the “Great Father’s” government of his “Poor Children\r\nof the Plains”--the villains were liberally rewarded and restored to\r\ntheir homes.[57] To cut off a bend of the Platte we once more left\r\nthe valley, ascended sundry slopes of sand and clay deeply cut by dry\r\ncreeks, and from the summit enjoyed a pretty view. A little to the left\r\nrose the aerial blue cone of that noble landmark, Laramie Peak, based\r\nlike a mass of solidified air upon a dark wall, the Black Hills, and\r\nlit up with the roseate hues of the morning. The distance was about\r\nsixty miles; you would have guessed twenty. On the right lay a broad\r\nvalley, bounded by brown rocks and a plain-colored distance, with the\r\nstream winding through it like a thread of quicksilver; in places it\r\nwas hidden from sight by thickets of red willow, cypress clumps, and\r\ndense cool cotton-woods. All was not still life; close below us rose\r\nthe white lodges of the Ogalala tribe.\r\n\r\n  [57] A United States official, fresh from Columbia, informed me that\r\n  the Indians there think twice before they murder a King George’s\r\n  man (Briton), while they hardly hesitate to kill a Boston man or\r\n  American citizen. He attributed this peculiarity principally to the\r\n  over lenity of his own government, and its want of persistency in\r\n  ferreting out and punishing the criminal. Under these circumstances,\r\n  it is hardly to be wondered at if the trader and traveler in Indian\r\n  countries take the law in their own hands. This excessive clemency\r\n  has acted evilly in “either Ind.” We may hope that its day is now\r\n  gone by.\r\n\r\n[INDIAN VILLAGES.]\r\n\r\nThese Indian villages are very picturesque from afar when dimly seen\r\ndotting the verdure of the valleys, and when their tall white cones,\r\nhalf hidden by willow clumps, lie against a blue background. The river\r\nside is the savages’ favorite site; next to it the hill foot, where\r\nlittle groups of three or four tents are often seen from the road,\r\nclustering mysteriously near a spring. Almost every prairie-band has\r\nits own way of constructing lodges, encamping and building fires, and\r\nthe experienced mountaineer easily distinguishes them.\r\n\r\nThe Osages make their lodges in the shape of a wagon-tilt, somewhat\r\nlike our gipsies’ tents, with a frame-work of bent willow rods planted\r\nin the ground, and supporting their blankets, skins, or tree-basts.\r\n\r\nThe Kickapoos build dwarf hay-stack huts, like some tribes of Africans,\r\nsetting poles in the earth, binding them over and lashing them together\r\nat the top; they are generally covered with clothes or bark.\r\n\r\nThe Witchetaws, Wakoes, Towakamis, and Tonkowas are described by the\r\n“Prairie Traveler” as erecting their hunting lodges of sticks put up in\r\nthe form of the frustrum of a cone, and bushed over like “boweries.”\r\n\r\nAll these tribes leave the frame-work of their lodges standing when\r\nthey shift ground, and thus the particular band is readily recognized.\r\n\r\nThe Sacs, Foxes, Winnebagoes, and Menomenes build lodges in the form\r\nof an ellipse, some of them 30-40 feet long, by 14-15 wide, and large\r\nenough to shelter twenty people permanently, and sixty temporarily.[58]\r\nThe covering is of plaited rush-mats bound to the poles, and a small\r\naperture in the lodge acts as chimney.\r\n\r\n  [58] The wigwams, huts, or cabins of the Eastern American tribes\r\n  were like these, large, solid, and well roofed with skins. The word\r\n  “lodge” is usually applied to the smaller and less comfortable\r\n  habitations of the Prairie Indians.\r\n\r\nThe Delawares and Shawnees, Cherokees and Choctaws, prefer the Indian\r\npal, a canvas covering thrown like a _tente d’abri_ over a stick\r\nsupported by two forked poles.\r\n\r\nThe Sioux, Arapahoes, Cheyennes, Utahs, Snakes, Blackfeet, and Kiowas\r\nuse the Comanche lodge covered with bison skins, which by dressing\r\nbecome flexible as canvas. They are usually of a shining white, save\r\nwhere smoke-stained near the top; the lodges of great chiefs are\r\nsometimes decorated with horizontal stripes of alternate black and\r\nwhite, and ornamented with figures human and bestial, crosses, circles,\r\nand arabesques. The lodge is made of eight to twenty-four straight\r\npeeled poles or saplings of ash, pine, cedar, or other wood, hard and\r\nelastic if possible, about 20 feet long; the largest marquees are 30\r\nfeet in diameter by 35 feet high, and are comprised of 26-30 buffalo\r\nskins; and they are sometimes planted round a “basement” or circular\r\nexcavation two or three feet deep. When pitching, three poles lashed\r\nto one another with a long line, somewhat below the thinner points,\r\nare raised perpendicularly, and the thicker ends are spread out in\r\na tripod to the perimeter of the circle which is to form the lodge\r\nfloor; the rest of the poles are then propped against the three first,\r\nand disposed regularly and equidistantly to make a steady and secure\r\nconical frame-work. The long line attached to the tripod is then\r\nwound several times round the point where the poles touch, and the\r\nlower end is made fast to the base of the lodge, thus securing the\r\nprops in position. The covering of dressed, hairless, and water-proof\r\ncow-buffalo hide--traders prefer osnaburg--cut and sewn to fit the\r\nframe like an envelope, and sometimes pinned together with skewers,\r\nis either raised at first with the tripod, or afterward hoisted with\r\na perch and spread round the complete structure. It is pinned to the\r\nground with wooden pegs, and a narrow space forms a doorway, which\r\nmay be closed with a blanket suspended from above and spread out\r\nwith two small sticks. The apex is left open with a triangular wing\r\nor flap, like a lateen sail, and is prevented from closing by a pole\r\ninserted into a pocket at the end. The aperture points to windward\r\nwhen ventilation is required, and, drawing like a wind-sail, it keeps\r\nthe interior cool and comfortable; when smoke is to be carried off,\r\nit is turned to leeward, thus giving draught to the fire, and making\r\nthe abode warm in the severest weather; while in lodges of other\r\nforms, you must lie down on the ground to prevent being asphyxiated.\r\nBy raising the lower part so as freely to admit the breeze, it is\r\nkept perfectly free from musquetoes, which are unable to resist the\r\nstrong draught. The squaws are always the tent-pitchers, and they equal\r\nOrientals in dexterity and judgment. Before the lodge of each warrior\r\nstands his light spear, planted Bedouin-fashion in the ground, near\r\nor upon a tripod of thin, cleanly-scraped, wands, seven to eight feet\r\nlong, which support his spotless white buffalo-skin targe, sometimes\r\ndecorated with his “totem”--we translate the word “crest”--and guarded\r\nby the usual prophylactic, a buckskin sack containing medicine.\r\nReaders of “Ivanhoe”--they are now more numerous in the New than in\r\nthe Old Country--ever feel “a passing impulse to touch one of these\r\nspotless shields with the muzzle of the gun, expecting a grim warrior\r\nto start from the lodge and resent the challenge.” The fire, as in the\r\nold Hebridean huts, is built in the centre of the hard dirt floor; a\r\nstrong stick planted at the requisite angle supports the kettle, and\r\naround the walls are berths divided by matted screens; the extremest\r\nuncleanliness, however, is a feature never absent. In a quiet country\r\nthese villages have a simple and patriarchal appearance. The tents,\r\nwhich number from fifteen to fifty, are disposed round a circular\r\ncentral space, where animals can be tethered. Some have attached to\r\nthem corrals of wattled canes, and a few boast of fields where corn and\r\npumpkins are raised.\r\n\r\n[THE “SIBLEY TENT.”]\r\n\r\nThe Comanche lodge is the favorite tenement of the Canadian and\r\nCreole voyageurs, on account of its coolness or warmth when wanted,\r\nits security against violent winds, and its freedom from musquetoes.\r\nWhile traveling in an Indian country they will use no other. It has\r\nbeen simplified by Major H. H. Sibley, of the United States Army, who\r\nhas changed the pole frame-work for a single central upright, resting\r\nupon an iron tripod, with hooks for suspending cooking utensils over\r\nthe fire; when folded up, the tripod admits the upright between its\r\nlegs, thereby reducing the length to one half--a portable size. The\r\n“Sibley tent” was the only shelter of the United States Army at Fort\r\nScott, in Utah Territory, during the hard winter of 1857-8, and gave\r\nuniversal satisfaction. The officers still keep to the old wall-tent.\r\nThis will, however, eventually be superseded by the new form, which can\r\naccommodate comfortably twelve, but not seventeen, the usual number\r\nallotted to it. Captain Marcy is of opinion that of the tents used in\r\nthe different armies of Europe, “none in point of convenience, comfort,\r\nand economy will compare with the ‘Sibley tent’ for campaigning in cold\r\nweather.” In summer, however, it has, like all conical tents, many\r\ndisadvantages: there is always a loss of room; and for comfortably\r\ndisposing kit--chair, table, and camp couch--there is nothing equal to\r\nthe wall-tent. The price of a “Sibley,” when made of good material,\r\nis from $40 to $50 (£8-£10), and it can be procured from Baltimore,\r\nPhiladelphia, and New York.\r\n\r\nAt 10 20 A.M. we halted to change mules at Badeau’s Ranch, or, as it is\r\nmore grandiloquently called, “Laramie City.” The “city,” like many a\r\nWestern “town,” still appertains to the category of things about to be;\r\nit is at present represented by a single large “store,” with out-houses\r\nfull of small half-breeds. The principal articles of traffic are\r\nliquors and groceries for the whites, and ornaments for the Indians,\r\nwhich are bartered for stock (i. e., animals) and peltries. The prices\r\nasked for the skips were from $1-$1 30 for a fox or a coyote, $3 for\r\nwolf, bear, or deer, $6-$7 for an elk, $5 for a common buffalo, and\r\nfrom $8 to $35 for the same painted, pictographed, and embroidered.\r\nSome of the party purchased moccasins, for which they paid $1-$2; the\r\nbest articles are made by the Snakes, and when embroidered by white\r\nwomen rise as high as $25. I bought, for an old friend who is insane\r\nupon the subject of pipes, one of the fine marble-like sandstone bowls\r\nbrought from the celebrated Côteau (slope) des Prairies, at the head of\r\nSioux River--\r\n\r\n    “On the mountains of the Prairie,\r\n    On the Great Red Pipe-stone Quarry.”\r\n\r\nThis instrument is originally the gift of Gitchie Manitou, who,\r\nstanding on the precipice of the Red Pipe-stone Rock, broke off a\r\nfragment and moulded it into a pipe, which, finished with a reed, he\r\nsmoked over his children to the north, south, east, and west. It is\r\nof queer shape, not unlike the clay and steatite articles used by the\r\nAbyssinians and the Turi or Sinaitic Bedouins. The length of the stick\r\nis 23 inches, of the stem 9·50, and of the bowl 5 inches; the latter\r\nstands at a right angle upon the former; both are circular; but the\r\n2·75 inches of stem, which project beyond the bowl, are beveled off so\r\nas to form an edge at the end. The peculiarity of the form is in the\r\npart where the tobacco is inserted; the hole is not more than half an\r\ninch broad, and descends straight without a bulge, while the aperture\r\nin the stem is exactly similar. The red color soon mottles and the bowl\r\nclogs if smoked with tobacco; in fact, it is fit for nothing but the\r\n“kinnikinik” of the Indians. To prepare this hard material with the\r\nrude tools of a savage must be a work of time and difficulty; also the\r\nbowls are expensive and highly valued: for mine I paid $5, and farther\r\nWest I could have exchanged it for an Indian pony.\r\n\r\n[THE BRULÉS AND GENERAL HARNEY.]\r\n\r\nHaving finished our _emplettes_ at M. Badeau’s, we set out at 11\r\n30 P.M. over a barren and reeking bit of sandy soil. Close to the\r\nstation, and a little to the right of the road, we passed the barrow\r\nwhich contains the remains of Lieutenant Grattan and his thirty men.\r\nA young second lieutenant of Irish origin and fiery temper, he was\r\nmarching westward with an interpreter, a small body of men, and two\r\nhowitzers, when a dispute arose, it is said, about a cow, between his\r\nparty and the Brûlés or Burnt-Thigh Indians. The latter were encamped\r\nin a village of 450 to 500 lodges, which, reckoning five to each,\r\ngives a total of 2200 to 2500 souls. A fight took place; the whites\r\nimprudently discharged both their cannon, overshooting the tents of the\r\nenemy; their muskets, however, did more execution, killing Matriya,\r\n“the Scattering Bear,” who had been made chief of all the Sioux by\r\nColonel Mitchell of the Indian Bureau. The savages, seeing the fall of\r\nUrsa Major, set to in real earnest; about 1200 charged the soldiers\r\nbefore they could reload; the little detachment broke, and not a man\r\nsurvived to tell the tale. The whites in the neighborhood narrowly\r\npreserved their scalps--M. Badeau owned that he owed his to his Sioux\r\nsquaw--and among other acts of violence was the murder and highway\r\nrobbery which has already been recounted. Both these events occurred in\r\n1854. As has been said, in 1855, General W. S. Harney, who, whatever\r\nmay be his faults as a diplomatist, is the most dreaded “Minahaska”[59]\r\nin the Indian country, punished the Brûlés severely at Ash Hollow. They\r\nwere led by their chosen chief Little Thunder, who, not liking the\r\nprospect, wanted to palaver; the general replied by a charge, which,\r\nas usual, scattered the “chivalry of the prairies” to the four winds.\r\n“Little Thunder” was solemnly deposed, and Mato Chigukesa, “Bear’s\r\nRib,” was ordered to reign in his stead; moreover, in 1856, a treaty\r\nwas concluded, giving to whites, among other things, the privilege\r\nof making roads along the Platte and White-Earth Rivers (Mankisita\r\nWakpa--Smoking-earth Water) to Forts Pierre and Laramie, and to pass up\r\nand down the Missouri in boats. Since that time, with the exception of\r\nplundering an English sportsman, Sir G---- G----, opposing Lieutenant\r\nWarren’s expedition to the Black Hills, and slaughtering a few traders\r\nand obscure travelers, the Brûlés have behaved tolerably to their\r\npale-face rivals.\r\n\r\n  [59] “Longknife.” The whites have enjoyed this title since 1758, when\r\n  Captain Gibson cut off with his sabre the head of Little Eagle, the\r\n  great Mingo or Chief, and won the title of Big-Knife Warrior. Savages\r\n  in America as well as Africa who ignore the sword always look upon\r\n  that weapon with horror. The Sioux call the Americans Wasichi, or bad\r\n  men.\r\n\r\nAs we advanced the land became more barren; it sadly wanted rain: it\r\nsuffers from drought almost every year, and what vegetable matter the\r\nsoil will produce the grasshopper will devour. Dead cattle cumbered\r\nthe way-side; the flesh had disappeared; the bones were scattered over\r\nthe ground; but the skins, mummified, as it were, by the dry heat, lay\r\nlife-like and shapeless, as in the Libyan Desert, upon the ground. This\r\nphenomenon will last till we enter the humid regions between the Sierra\r\nNevada and the Pacific Ocean, and men tell wonderful tales of the time\r\nduring which meat can be kept. The road was a succession of steep\r\nascents and jumps down sandy ground. A Sioux “buck,” mounted upon a\r\nneat nag, and wrapped up, despite sun and glare, as if it had been the\r\ndepth of winter, passed us, sedulously averting his eyes. The driver\r\ndeclared that he recognized the horse, and grumbled certain Western\r\nfacetiæ concerning “hearty-chokes and caper sauce.”\r\n\r\nIn these lands the horse-thief is the great enemy of mankind; for him\r\nthere is no pity, no mercy; Lynch-law is held almost too good for him;\r\nto shoot him _in flagrante delicto_ is like slaying a man-eating Bengal\r\nroyal tiger--it entitles you to the respect and gratitude of your\r\nspecies. I asked our conductor whether dandiness was at the bottom of\r\nthe “buck’s” heavy dress. “’Guess,” was the reply, “what keeps cold\r\nout, keeps heat out tew!”\r\n\r\nAt 12 15 P.M., crossing Laramie’s Fork, a fine clear stream about forty\r\nyards broad, we reached Fort Laramie--another “fort” by courtesy, or\r\nrather by order--where we hoped to recruit our exhausted stores.\r\n\r\nThe straggling cantonment requires no description: it has the usual\r\nbig flag, barracks, store-houses, officers’ quarters, guard-houses,\r\nsutlers’ stores, and groceries, which doubtless make a good thing by\r\nselling deleterious “strychnine” to passing trains who can afford to\r\npay $6 per gallon.\r\n\r\nFort Laramie, called Fort John in the days of the American Fur Company,\r\nwas used by them as a store-house for the bear and buffalo skins,\r\nwhich they collected in thousands. The old adobe _enceinte_, sketched\r\nand described by Frémont and Stansbury, soon disappeared after the\r\nplace was sold to the United States government. Its former rival was\r\nFort Platte, belonging in 1842--when the pale face first opened this\r\nroad--to Messrs. Sybille, Adams, and Co., and situated immediately on\r\nthe point of land at the junction of Laramie Fort with the Platte. The\r\nclimate here is arid and parching in summer, but in winter tolerably\r\nmild, considering the altitude--4470 feet--and the proximity of the\r\nBlack Hills; yet it has seen hard frost in September. It is also well\r\ndefended from the warm, moist, and light winds, which, coming from the\r\nMexican Gulf, cause “calentures” on the lower course of the river. The\r\nsoil around the settlement is gravelly and sterile, the rocks are sand,\r\nlime, and clay, and there is a solitary, desolate look upon every thing\r\nbut the bright little stream that bubbles from the dark heights. The\r\ncourse is from S.W. to N.E.: about half way it bifurcates, with a right\r\nfork to the west and main fork east, and near Laramie it receives its\r\nmain affluent, the Chugwater.\r\n\r\nMy companion kindly introduced me to the officer commanding the fort,\r\nColonel B. Alexander, 10th Infantry, and we were at once made at home.\r\nThe amiable mistress of the house must find charitable work enough to\r\ndo in providing for the wants of way-worn friends who pass through\r\nLaramie from east to west. We rested and dined in the cool comfortable\r\nquarters, with only one qualm at heart--we were so soon to leave them.\r\nOn these occasions the driver seems to know by instinct that you are\r\nenjoying yourself, while he, as an outsider, is not. He becomes,\r\ntherefore, unusually impatient to start; perhaps, also, time runs more\r\nrapidly than it is wont. At any rate, after a short two hours, we were\r\ncompelled to shake hands with our kind and considerate hosts, and to\r\nreturn to limbo--the mail-wagon.\r\n\r\nFrom Fort Laramie westward the geological formation changes; the great\r\nlimestone deposits disappear, and are succeeded by a great variety of\r\nsandstones, some red, argillaceous, and compact; others gray or yellow,\r\nferruginous, and coarse. Pudding-stones or conglomerates also abound,\r\nand the main chain of the Laramie Mountains is supposed to be chiefly\r\ncomposed of this rock.\r\n\r\nBeyond the fort there are two roads. The longer leads to the right,\r\nnear the Platte River. It was formerly, and perhaps is still, a\r\nfavorite with emigrants. We preferred the left, which, crossing the\r\nedges of the Black Hills, is rough and uneven, but is “some shorter,”\r\nas the guide-book says, than the other. The weather began to be\r\nunusually disagreeable with heat and rain-drops from a heavy nimbus,\r\nthat forced us to curtain up the rattling vehicle; perhaps, too, we\r\nwere a little cross, contrasting the present with the past--civilized\r\nsociety, a shady bungalow, and wonderfully good butter. At 4 P.M.,\r\nfollowing the Platte Valley, after two hours’ drive we halted to change\r\nmules at Ward’s Station, _alias_ the “Central Star,” where several\r\nwhites were killed by the Sioux in 1855, among them M. Montalan, a\r\nParisian.\r\n\r\n[HORSESHOE STATION.]\r\n\r\nAgain we started for another twenty-five miles at 4 P.M. The road was\r\nrough, and the driver had a curious proclivity for losing the way. I\r\nhave often found this to be the case after passing through a station.\r\nThere was little to remark, except that the country was poor and bad,\r\nthat there was clear water in a ravine to the right, and that we were\r\nvery tired and surly. But as sorrow comes to an end as well as joy, so,\r\nat 9 30 P.M., we drove in, somewhat consoled, to Horseshoe Station--the\r\nold _Fer à Cheval_--where one of the road agents, Mr. Slade, lived, and\r\nwhere we anticipated superior comfort.\r\n\r\nWe were _entichés_ by the aspect of the buildings, which were on an\r\nextensive scale--in fact, got up regardless of expense. An ominous\r\nsilence, however, reigned around. At last, by hard knocking, we were\r\nadmitted into a house with the Floridian style of veranda previously\r\ndescribed, and by the pretensions of the room we at once divined our\r\nmisfortune--we were threatened with a “lady.” The “lady” will, alas!\r\nfollow us to the Pacific; even in hymns we read,\r\n\r\n    “Now let the Prophet’s heart rejoice,\r\n      His noble lady’s too.”\r\n\r\n[“LADIES.”]\r\n\r\nOur mishap was really worse than we expected--we were exposed to two\r\n“ladies,” and of these one was a Bloomer. It is only fair to state that\r\nit was the only hermaphrodite of the kind that ever met my eyes in the\r\nUnited States; the great founder of the order has long since subsided\r\ninto her original obscurity, and her acolytes have relapsed into the\r\nweakness of petticoats. The Bloomer was an uncouth being; her hair, cut\r\nlevel with her eyes, depended with the graceful curl of a drake’s tail\r\naround a flat Turanian countenance, whose only expression was sullen\r\ninsolence. The body-dress, glazed brown calico, fitted her somewhat\r\nlike a soldier’s tunic, developing haunches which would be admired only\r\nin venison; and--curious _inconséquence_ of woman’s nature!--all this\r\nsacrifice of appearance upon the shrine of comfort did not prevent her\r\nwearing that kind of crinoline depicted by Mr. _Punch_ upon “our Mary\r\nHanne.” The pantalettes of glazed brown calico, like the vest, tunic,\r\nblouse, shirt, or whatever they may call it, were in peg-top style,\r\nadmirably setting off a pair of thin-soled Frenchified patent-leather\r\nbottines, with elastic sides, which contained feet large, broad, and\r\nflat as a negro’s in Unyamwezi. The dear creature had a husband: it was\r\nhardly safe to look at her, and as for sketching her, I avoided it, as\r\nmen are bidden by the poet to avoid the way of Slick of Tennessee. The\r\nother “lady,” though more decently attired, was like women in this wild\r\npart of the world generally--cold and disagreeable in manner, full of\r\n“proper pride,” with a touch-me-not air, which reminded me of a certain\r\n\r\n                        “Miss Baxter,\r\n    Who refused a man before he axed her.”\r\n\r\nHer husband was the renowned Slade:\r\n\r\n    “Of gougers fierce, the eyes that pierce, the fiercest gouger he.”\r\n\r\nHis was a noted name for “deadly strife;” he had the reputation of\r\nhaving killed his three men; and a few days afterward the grave that\r\nconcealed one of his murders was pointed out to me. This pleasant\r\nindividual “for an evening party” wore the revolver and bowie-knife\r\nhere, there, and every where. He had lately, indeed, had a strong\r\nhint not to forget his weapon. One M. Jules, a French trader, after\r\na quarrel which took place at dinner, walked up to him and fired a\r\npistol, wounding him in the breast. As he rose to run away Jules\r\ndischarged a second, which took effect upon his back, and then, without\r\ngiving him time to arm, fetched a gun and favored him with a dose\r\nof slugs somewhat larger than revolver bullets. The fiery Frenchman\r\nhad two narrow escapes from Lynch-lawyers: twice he was hung between\r\nwagons, and as often he was cut down. At last he disappeared in the\r\nfarther West, and took to lodge and squaw. The avenger of blood\r\nthreatens to follow him up, but as yet he has taken no steps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INDIANS.\r\n\r\nThe Western Swell.\r\n\r\nThe Sioux.\r\n\r\nThe old Shoshonee.\r\n\r\nThe Arapaho.\r\n\r\nJake the Shoshonee.\r\n\r\nThe Crow.]\r\n\r\nIt at once became evident that the station was conducted upon the\r\nprinciple of the Western hotel-keeper of the last generation, and\r\nof Continental Europe about A.D. 1500--the innkeeper of “Anne of\r\nGeierstein”--that is to say, for his own convenience; the public there\r\nwas the last thing thought of. One of our party who had ventured\r\ninto the kitchen was fiercely ejected by the “ladies.” In asking about\r\ndormitories we were informed that “lady travelers” were admitted into\r\nthe house, but that the ruder sex must sleep where it could--or not\r\nsleep at all if it preferred. We found a barn outside: it was hardly\r\nfit for a decently brought-up pig; the floor was damp and knotty; there\r\nwas not even a door to keep out the night breeze, now becoming raw, and\r\nseveral drunken fellows lay in different parts of it. Two were in one\r\nbunk, embracing maudlingly, and freely calling for drinks of water.\r\nInto this disreputable hole we were all thrust for the night: among\r\nus, it must be remembered, was a federal judge, who had officiated for\r\nyears as minister at a European court. His position, poor man! procured\r\nhim nothing but a broken-down pallet. It was his first trip to the Far\r\nWest, and yet, so easily are Americans satisfied, and so accustomed are\r\nthey to obey the ridiculous jack-in-office who claims to be one of the\r\npowers that be, he scarcely uttered a complaint. I, for one, grumbled\r\nmyself to sleep. May gracious Heaven keep us safe from all “ladies” in\r\nfuture! better a hundred times the squaw, with her uncleanliness and\r\ncivility.\r\n\r\nWe are now about to leave the land of that great and dangerous people,\r\nthe Sioux, and before bidding adieu to them it will be advisable to\r\ndevote a few pages to their ethnology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nThe Sioux or Dakotahs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[THE SIOUX.]\r\n\r\nThe Sioux belong essentially to the savage, in opposition to\r\nthe Aztecan peoples of the New World. In the days of Major Pike\r\n(1805-1807), they were the dread of all the neighboring tribes, from\r\nthe confluence of the Mississippi and the Missouri to the Raven River\r\non the latter. According to Lieutenant Warren, they are still scattered\r\nover an immense territory extending from the Mississippi on the east\r\nto the Black Hills on the west, and from the forks of the Platte on\r\nthe south to Minsi Wakan, or the Devil’s Lake, on the north. Early in\r\nthe winter of 1837 they ceded to the United States all their lands\r\nlying east of the Mississippi, which became the Territory of Minnesota.\r\nThey are to the North American tribes what the great Anizeh race is\r\namong the Bedouins of Arabia. Their vernacular name, Dakotah, which\r\nsome pronounce Lakotah, and others Nakotah, is translated “leagued” or\r\n“allied,” and they sometimes speak of themselves as Osheti Shakowin, or\r\nthe “Seven Council Fires.” The French call them “les Coupes-gorges,”\r\nfrom their sign or symbol, and the whites generally know them as the\r\nSues or Sioux, from the plural form of Nadonaisi, which in Ojibwa\r\nmeans an enemy. The race is divided into seven principal bands, viz.:\r\n\r\n1. Mdewakantonwan (Minowa Kantongs[60] or Gens du Lac), meaning\r\n“Village of the Mdewakan”--Mille Lacs or Spirit Lake. They formerly\r\nextended from Prairie du Chien to Prairie des Français, thirty-five\r\nmiles up the St. Peter’s River. They have now moved farther west.\r\nThis tribe, which includes seven bands, is considered the bravest\r\nof the Sioux, and has even waged an internecine war with the Folles\r\nAvoines[61] or Menomenes, who are reputed the most gallant of the\r\nOjibwas (Chippewas), and who, inhabiting a country intersected by\r\nlakes, swamps, water-courses, and impenetrable morasses, long bade\r\ndefiance to all their neighbors. They have received annuities since\r\n1838, and their number enrolled in 1850 was 2000 souls.\r\n\r\n  [60] The first is the correct, the second is the old and incorrect\r\n  form of writing the name.\r\n\r\n  [61] The Folles Avoines are a small tribe esteemed by the whites\r\n  and respected by their own race; their hunting-grounds are the\r\n  same as those of the Winnebagoes. They speak a peculiar dialect.\r\n  But all understand the copious and sonorous, but difficult and\r\n  complicated Algonquin or Ojibwa--the language of some of the old New\r\n  England races, Pequots, Delawares, Mohicans, Abenaki, Narragansets,\r\n  Penobscots, and the tribes about the Lake regions and the head-waters\r\n  of the Mississippi, viz., Ottawa, Potawotomies, Menomene, Knisteneaux\r\n  or Cree, Sac, Kickapoo, Maskigo, Shawnee, Miami, Kaskaskia, etc.\r\n  The other great northeastern language is that of the Mohawk, spoken\r\n  by the Oneida, Onondaga, Seneca, Cayuga, Tuscarora, Wyandotte, and\r\n  Cherokee.\r\n\r\n  “Folles Avoines” is the Canadian French for the wild rice (_Zizania\r\n  aquatica_), a tall, tubular, reedy water-plant, plentiful on the\r\n  marshy margins of the northern lakes and in the plashy waters of\r\n  the Upper Mississippi. Its leaves and spikes, though much larger,\r\n  resemble those of oats. Millions of migrating water-fowl fatten on\r\n  it before their autumnal flights to the south, while in autumn it\r\n  furnishes the Northern savages and the Canadian traders and hunters\r\n  with their annual supply of grain. It is used for bread by most of\r\n  the tribes to the northwest.\r\n\r\n2. Wahpekute (Washpeconte, translated Gens de Feuillestirées, and by\r\nothers the “Leaf Shooters”). Their habitation lies westward of the Des\r\nMoines, Cannon, and Blue-Earth Rivers. According to Major Pike, they\r\nwere like the Bedouin Ghuzw, a band of vagabonds formed of refugees,\r\nwho for some bad deed had been expelled their tribes. The meaning of\r\ntheir name is unknown; in 1850 they numbered 500 or 600 souls.\r\n\r\n3. Sisitonwan (Sussitongs, or the Village of the Marsh). This band\r\nused to hunt over the vast prairies lying eastward of the Mississippi,\r\nand up that stream as high as Raven River. They now plant their corn\r\nabout Lake Traverse (Lac Travers) and on the Côteau des Prairies, and\r\nnumbered in 1850 about 2500 souls.\r\n\r\n4. Wahpetonwans (Washpetongs, Gens des Feuilles, because they lived in\r\nwoods), the “Village in the Leaves.” They have moved from their old\r\nhome about the Little Rapids of the Minnesota River to Lac qui Parle\r\nand Big Stone Lake. In 1850 they numbered 1000 to 1200 souls. They\r\nplant corn, have substituted the plow for the hoe, and, according to\r\nthe missionaries, have made some progress in reading and writing their\r\nown language.\r\n\r\nThe above four constitute the Mississippi and Minnesota Sioux, and are\r\ncalled by those on the Missouri “Isánti,” from Isanati or Isanyati,\r\nbecause they once lived near Isantamde, one of the Mille Lacs. They\r\nnumber, according to Major Pike, 5775 souls; according to Lieutenant\r\nWarren, about 6200; and many of those on the Mississippi have long\r\nsince become semi-civilized by contact with the white settlements, and\r\nhave learned to cultivate the soil. Others, again, follow the buffalo\r\nin their primitive wildness, and have of late years given much trouble\r\nto the settlers of Northern Iowa.\r\n\r\n5. Ihanktonwans (Yanctongs, meaning “Village at the End”), also\r\nsometimes called Wichiyela, or First Nation. They are found at the\r\nmouth of the Big Sioux, between it and the Missouri River, as high\r\nup as Fort Look-out, and on the opposite bank of the Missouri. In\r\n1851 they were set down at 240 lodges = 2400 souls; they have since\r\nincreased to 360 lodges and 2880 souls, of whom 576 are warriors.\r\nDistance from the buffalo country has rendered them poor; the proximity\r\nof the pale face has degenerated them, and the United States have\r\npurchased most of their lands.\r\n\r\n6. Ihanktonwannas (Yanctannas), one of the “End Village” bands. They\r\nrange between the James and the Missouri Rivers, as far north as\r\nDevil’s Lake. The Dakotah Mission numbered them at 400 lodges = 4000\r\nsouls; subsequent observers at 800 lodges = 6400 souls, and 1280\r\nwarriors; and, being spirited and warlike, they give much trouble to\r\nsettlers in the Dakotah Territory. A small portion live in dirt lodges\r\nduring the summer. This band suffered severely from small-pox in the\r\nwinter of 1856-7. They are divided into the Hunkpatidans (of unknown\r\nsignification), Pabakse or Cut-heads, and Kiyuksa, deriders or breakers\r\nof law. From their sub-tribe the Wazikute, or Pine Shooters, sprang, it\r\nis said, the Assiniboin tribe of the Dakotahs. Major Pike divides the\r\n“Yanctongs” into two grand divisions, the Yanctongs of the North and\r\nthe Yanctongs of the South.\r\n\r\n7. Titonwan (Teton, “Village of the Prairies”), inhabiting the\r\ntrans-Missourian prairies, and extending westward to the dividing ridge\r\nbetween the Little Missouri and Powder River, and thence south on a\r\nline near the 106° meridian. They constitute more than one half of\r\nthe whole Dakotah nation. In 1850 they were numbered at 1250 lodges =\r\n12,500 souls, but that number was supposed to be overestimated. They\r\nare allied by marriage with the Cheyennes and Arickarees, but are\r\nenemies of the Pawnees and Crows. The Titonwan, according to Major\r\nPike, are, like the Yanctongs, the most erratic and independent not\r\nonly of the Sioux, but “of all the Indians in the world.” They follow\r\nthe buffalo as chance directs, clothing themselves with the robes, and\r\nmaking their lodges, saddles, and bridles of the same material, the\r\nflesh of the animal furnishing their food. None but the few families\r\nconnected with the whites have planted corn. Possessing an innumerable\r\nstock of horses, they are here this day and five hundreds of miles\r\noff in a week, moving with a rapidity scarcely to be imagined by the\r\ninhabitants of the civilized world: they find themselves equally at\r\nhome in all places. The Titonwan are divided into seven principal\r\nbands, viz.:\r\n\r\nThe Hunkpapa, “they who camp by themselves” (?). They roam from the\r\nBig Cheyenne up to the Yellow Stone, and west to the Black Hills, and\r\nnumber 365 lodges, 2920 souls, and 584 warriors.\r\n\r\nThe Sisahapa or Blackfeet live with the Hunkpapa, and, like them, have\r\nlittle reverence for the whites: they number 165 lodges, 1321 souls,\r\nand 264 warriors.\r\n\r\nThe Itazipko, Sans Arc, or “No Bows;” a curious name--like the Sans\r\nArc Pawnees, they are good archers--perhaps given to them in olden\r\ntimes, when, like certain tribes of negroes, they used the spear to\r\nthe exclusion of other weapons: others, however, translate the word\r\n“Bow-pith.” They roam over nearly the same lands as the Hunkpapa,\r\nnumber about 170 lodges, 1360 souls, and 272 warriors.\r\n\r\nThe Minnikanye-wozhipu, “those who plant by the water,” dwell between\r\nthe Black Hills and the Platte. They number about 200 lodges, 1600\r\ninmates, and 320 warriors: they are favorably disposed toward the\r\nwhites.\r\n\r\nThe Ogalala or Okandanda are generally to be found on or about the\r\nPlatte, near Fort Laramie, and are the most friendly of all the\r\nTitonwan toward the whites. They number about 460 lodges, 3680 souls,\r\nand 736 warriors.\r\n\r\nThe Sichangu, Brûlés or Burnt-Thighs, living on the Niobrara and\r\nWhite-Earth Rivers, and ranging from the Platte to the Cheyenne, number\r\nabout 380 lodges, containing 3680 inmates.\r\n\r\nThe Oohenonpa, “Two Boilings” or “Two Kettle-band,” are much scattered\r\namong other tribes, but are generally to be found in the vicinity\r\nof Fort Pierre. They number about 100 lodges, 800 inmates, and 160\r\nwarriors.\r\n\r\nThe author of the above estimate, allotting eight to ten inmates to\r\na lodge, of whom between one fifth and one sixth are warriors, makes\r\nan ample allowance. It is usual to reckon in a population between one\r\nfourth, one fifth, and one sixth--according to the work--as capable\r\nof bearing arms, but the civilized rule will not apply to the North\r\nAmerican Indian. The grand total of the number of the Sioux nations,\r\nincluding the Isánti, would amount to 30,200 souls. Half a century\r\nago it was estimated by Major Pike at 21,675, and in 1850 the Dakotah\r\nMission set them down at 25,000. It is the opinion of many that,\r\nnotwithstanding the ravages of cholera and small-pox, the Dakotah\r\nnation, except when mingled with the frontier settlements, rather\r\nincreases than diminishes. It has been observed by missionaries that\r\nwhenever an account of births and deaths has been kept in a village the\r\nformer usually exceed the latter. The original numbers of the Prairie\r\nIndians have been greatly overestimated both by themselves and by\r\nstrangers; the only practicable form of census is the rude proceeding\r\nof counting their “tipi,” or skin tents. It is still a moot question\r\nhow far the Prairie Indians have diminished in numbers, which can not\r\nbe decided for some years.[62]\r\n\r\n  [62] At the time of the first settlement of the country by the\r\n  English no certain estimate was made; at the birth of the thirteen\r\n  original states, the Indians, according to Dr. Trumbull, did not\r\n  exceed 150,000. In 1860, the number of Indians within the limits of\r\n  the United States was estimated by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs\r\n  at 350,000.\r\n\r\nThe Dakotahs are mostly a purely hunting tribe in the lowest condition\r\nof human society: they have yet to take the first step, and to become a\r\npastoral people. The most civilized are the Mdewakantonwans, who, even\r\nat the beginning of the present century, built log huts and “stocked”\r\nland with corn, beans, and pumpkins. The majority of the bands hunt\r\nthe buffalo within their own limits throughout the summer, and in\r\nthe winter pitch their lodges in the clumps or fringes of tree and\r\nunderwood along the banks of the lakes and streams. The bark of the\r\ncotton-wood furnishes fodder for their horses during the snowy season,\r\nand to obtain it the creeks and branches have been thinned or entirely\r\ndenuded of their beautiful groves. They buy many animals from the\r\nSouthern Indians, who have stolen them from New Mexico, or trapped them\r\non the plains below the Rocky Mountains. Considerable numbers are also\r\nbred by themselves. The Dakotah nation is one of the most warlike and\r\nnumerous in the United States territory. In single combat on horseback\r\nthey are described as having no superiors; a skill acquired by constant\r\npractice enables them to spear their game at full speed, and the\r\nrapidity with which they discharge their arrows, and the accuracy\r\nof their aim, rival the shooting which may be made with a revolver.\r\nThey are not, however, formidable warriors; want of discipline and\r\nof confidence in one another render them below their mark. Like the\r\nMoroccans in their last war with Spain, they never attack when they\r\nshould, and they never fail to attack when they should not.\r\n\r\n[THE OJIBWA.]\r\n\r\nThe Dakotahs, when first visited by the whites, lived around the\r\nhead-waters of the Mississippi and the Red River of the north. They\r\nhave gradually migrated toward the west and southwest, guarded by\r\ntheir allies the Cheyennes, who have given names successively to the\r\nCheyenne of Red River, to the Big Cheyenne of the Missouri, and to the\r\nsection of the country between the Platte and the Arkansas which they\r\nnow occupy. The Dakotah first moved to the land now occupied by the\r\nOjibwa (anciently known as Chippewas, Orechipewa, or Sauteurs[63]),\r\nwhich tribe inhabited the land between Sault[64] St. Marie and Lake\r\nWinnipeg, while their allies the Crees occupied the country from Lake\r\nWinnipeg to the Kisiskadjiwan and Assiniboin Rivers. The plains lying\r\nsouthward of the latter river were the fields of many a fierce and\r\nbloody fight between the Dakotahs and the other allied two tribes,\r\nuntil a feud caused by jealousy of the women arose among the former,\r\nand made a division which ended in their becoming irreconcilable\r\nenemies, as they are indeed to the present day. The defeated party fled\r\nto the craggy precipices of the Lake of the Woods, and received from\r\nthe Ojibwa the name of Assiniboin or Dakotah of the Rocks, by which\r\nthey are now universally known to the whites. They retain, however,\r\namong themselves the term Dakotah, although their kinsmen universally,\r\nwhen speaking of them, called them “hohe” or enemies, and they still\r\nspeak the Sioux language. After this feud the Assiniboins strengthened\r\nthemselves by alliance with the Ojibwa and Cree tribes, and drove the\r\nDakotah from all the country north of the Cheyenne River, which is now\r\nregarded as the boundary-line. The three races are still friendly, and\r\nso hostile to the Dakotah that no lasting peace can be made between\r\nthem; in case of troubles with either party, the government of the\r\nUnited States might economically and effectually employ one against the\r\nother. The common war-ground is the region about Lake Minsiwakan, where\r\nthey all meet when hunting buffalo. The Assiniboin tribe now extends\r\nfrom the Red River westward along the Missouri as far as the mouth of\r\nMilk River: a large portion of their lands, like those of the Cree, is\r\nBritish territory. They suffered severely from small-pox in 1856-7,\r\nlosing about 1500 of their tribe, and now number about 450 lodges, or\r\n3600 souls. Having comparatively few horses, they rely mainly upon the\r\ndog for transportation, and they use its flesh as food.\r\n\r\n  [63] The Rev. Peter Jones (Kahkewagquody), in his history of the\r\n  Ojibwa Indians, makes “Chippewa” a corrupted word, signifying\r\n  the “Puckered-Moccasin People;” the Abbé Domenech (“Seven Years’\r\n  Residence in the Great Deserts of North America”--a mere compilation)\r\n  draws an unauthorized distinction between Chippewas and Ojibwas, but\r\n  can not say what it is. He explains Ojibwa, the form of Ojidwa, to\r\n  mean “a singularity in the voice or pronunciation.”\r\n\r\n  [64] Pronounced “Soo:” the word is old French, still commonly used in\r\n  Canada and the North, and means rapids.\r\n\r\n[THE INDIAN’S FUTURE.]\r\n\r\nThe Dakotah, according to Lieutenant Warren, are still numerous,\r\nindependent, warlike, and powerful, and have the means of prolonging\r\nan able resistance to the advance of the Western settlers. Under\r\nthe present policy of the United States government--this is written\r\nby an American--which there is no reason to believe likely to be\r\nchanged, encroachments will continue, and battle and murder will be\r\nthe result. There are many inevitable causes at work to produce war\r\nwith the Dakotah before many years.[65] The conflict will end in the\r\ndiscomfiture of the natives, who will then fast fall away. Those\r\ndispossessed of their lands can not, as many suppose, retire farther\r\nwest; the regions lying beyond one tribe are generally occupied by\r\nanother, with whom deadly animosity exists. Even when the white\r\nsettlers advance their frontier, the natives linger about till their\r\nown poverty and vice consign them to oblivion, and the present policy\r\nadopted by the government is the best that could be devised for their\r\nextermination. It is needless to say that many of the Sioux look\r\nforward to the destruction of their race with all the feelings of\r\ndespair with which the civilized man would contemplate the extinction\r\nof his nationality. How indeed, poor devils, are they to live when the\r\npale face comes with his pestilent fire-water and small-pox, followed\r\nup with paper and pen work, to be interpreted under the gentle auspices\r\nof fire and steel?\r\n\r\n  [65] Lieutenant Warren considered the greatest point of his\r\n  explorations to be the knowledge of the proper routes by which to\r\n  invade their country and to conquer them. The project may be found\r\n  in the Report of the Secretary of War. I quote Mr. Warren’s opinion\r\n  concerning the future of the Dakotahs as a contrast to that of the\r\n  Dakotah Mission. My own view will conclude the case in p. 102.\r\n\r\nThe advance of the settlements is universally acknowledged by the\r\npeople of the United States to be a political necessity in the\r\nnational development, and on that ground only is the displacement\r\nof the rightful owners of the soil justifiable. But the government,\r\ninstead of preparing the way for settlements by wise and just purchases\r\nfrom those in possession, and proper support and protection for the\r\nindigent and improvident race thus dispossessed, is sometimes behind\r\nits obligations. There are instances of Congress refusing or delaying\r\nto ratify the treaties made by its duly authorized agents. The settler\r\nand pioneer are thus precipitated into the Indian country, without the\r\nsavage having received the promised consideration, and he often, in a\r\nmanner that enlists the sympathies of mankind, takes up the tomahawk\r\nand perishes in the attempt. It frequently happens that the Western\r\nsettlers are charged with bringing about these wars; they are now,\r\nhowever, fighting the battles of civilization exactly as they were\r\nfought three centuries ago upon the Atlantic shore, under circumstances\r\nthat command equal admiration and approval. While, therefore, we\r\nsympathize with the savage, we can not but feel for the unhappy\r\nsquatter, whose life is sacrificed to the Indian’s vengeance by the\r\nerrors or dilatoriness of those whose duty it is to protect him.\r\n\r\nThe people of the United States, of course, know themselves to be\r\ninvincible by the hands of these half-naked savages. But the Indians,\r\nwho on their own ground still outnumber the whites, are by no means\r\nso convinced of the fact. Until the army of Utah moved westward, many\r\nof them had never seen a soldier. At a grand council of the Dakotah,\r\nin the summer of 1857, on the North Fork of the Platte River, they\r\nsolemnly pledged themselves to resist the encroachments of the whites,\r\nand, if necessary, to “whip” them out of the country. The appearance of\r\nthe troops has undoubtedly produced a highly beneficial effect; still,\r\nsomething more is wanted. Similarly in Hindostan, though the natives\r\nknew that the British army numbered hundreds of thousands, every petty\r\nindependent prince thought himself fit to take the field against the\r\nintruder, till the failure of the attempt suggested to him some respect\r\nfor _les gros bataillons_.\r\n\r\nThe Sioux differ greatly in their habits from the Atlantic tribes of\r\ntimes gone by. The latter lived in wigwams or villages of more stable\r\nconstruction than the lodge; they cultivated the soil, never wandered\r\nfar from home, made their expeditions on foot, having no horses, and\r\nrarely came into action unless they could “tree” themselves. They\r\ninflicted horrid tortures on their prisoners, as every English child\r\nhas read; but, Arab-like, they respected the honor of their female\r\ncaptives. The Prairie tribes are untamed and untamable savages,\r\nsuperior only to the “Arab” hordes of great cities, who appear\r\ndestined to play in the history of future ages the part of Goth and\r\nVandal, Scythian, Bedouin, and Turk. Hitherto the _rôle_ which these\r\nhunters have sustained in the economy of nature has been to prepare,\r\nby thinning off its wild animals, a noble portion of the world for\r\nthe higher race about to succeed them. Captain Mayne Reid somewhere\r\nderides the idea of the Indian’s progress toward extinction. A cloud\r\nof authorities bear witness against him. East of the Mississippi the\r\nsavage has virtually died out, and few men allow him two prospective\r\ncenturies of existence in the West, unless he be left, which he will\r\nnot be, to himself.\r\n\r\n“Wolves of women born,” the Prairie Indians despise agriculture as the\r\nBedouin does. Merciless freebooters, they delight in roaming; like\r\nall equestrian and uncivilized people, they are perfect horsemen, but\r\npoor fighters when dismounted, and they are nothing without their\r\nweapons. As a rule they rarely torture their prisoners, except when\r\nan old man or woman is handed over to the squaws and pappooses “pour\r\nles amuser,” as a Canadian expressed it. Near and west of the Rocky\r\nMountains, however, the Shoshonees and the Yutas (Utahs) are as cruel\r\nas their limited intellects allow them to be. Moreover, all the Prairie\r\ntribes never fail to subject women to an ordeal worse than death. The\r\nbest character given of late years to the Sioux was by a traveler in\r\n1845, who writes that “their freedom and power have imparted to their\r\nwarriors some gentlemanly qualities; they are cleanly, dignified and\r\ngraceful in manners, brave, proud, and independent in bearing and deed.”\r\n\r\n[THE SIOUX CHARACTER.]\r\n\r\nThe qualities of the Sioux, and of the Prairie tribes generally, are\r\nlittle prized by those who have seen much of them. They ignore the\r\nvery existence of gratitude; the benefits of years can not win their\r\naffections. After boarding and lodging with a white for any length of\r\ntime, they will steal his clothes; and, after receiving any number of\r\ngifts, they will haggle for the value of the merest trifle. They are\r\ninveterate thieves and beggars; the Western settlers often pretend\r\nnot to understand their tongue for fear of exposing themselves to\r\nperpetual pilfering and persecution; and even the squaws, who live with\r\nthe pale faces, annoy their husbands by daily applications for beads\r\nand other coveted objects; they are cruel to one another as children.\r\nThe obstinate revengefulness of their vendetta is proverbial; they\r\nhate with the “hate of Hell;” and, like the Highlanders of old, if\r\nthe author of an injury escape them, they vent their rage upon the\r\ninnocent, because he is of the same clan or color. If struck by a white\r\nman, they must either kill him or receive damages in the shape of a\r\nhorse; and after the most trivial injury they can never be trusted.\r\nTheir punishments are Draconic; for all things death, either by\r\nshooting or burning. Their religion is a low form of fetichism. They\r\nplace their women in the most degraded position. The squaw is a mere\r\nslave, living a life of utter drudgery; and when the poor creature\r\nwishes, according to the fashion of her sex, to relieve her feelings\r\nby a domestic “scene,” followed by a “good cry,” or to use her knife\r\nupon a sister squaw, as the Trasteverina mother uses her bodkin, the\r\nhusband, after squatting muffled up, in hope that the breeze will\r\nblow over, enforces silence with a cudgel. The warrior, considering\r\nthe chase an ample share of the labor-curse, is so lazy that he will\r\nnot rise to saddle or unsaddle his pony; he will sit down and ask\r\na white man to fetch him water, and only laugh if reproved. Like a\r\nwild beast, he can not be broken to work; he would rather die than\r\nemploy himself in honest industry--a mighty contrast to the negro,\r\nwhose only happiness is in serving. He invariably attributes an act\r\nof kindness, charity, or forbearance to fear. Ungenerous, he extols,\r\nlike the Bedouin, generosity to the skies. He never makes a present\r\nexcept for the purpose of receiving more than its equivalent; and an\r\n“Indian gift” has come to be a proverb, meaning any thing reclaimed\r\nafter being given away. Impulsive as the African, his mind is blown\r\nabout by storms of unaccountable contradictions. Many a white has\r\nsuddenly seen the scalping-knife restored to its sheath instead of\r\nbeing buried in his flesh, while others have been as unexpectedly\r\nassaulted and slain by those from whom they expected kindness and\r\nhospitality. The women are mostly cold and chaste. The men have vices\r\nwhich can not be named: their redeeming points are fortitude and\r\nendurance of hardship; moreover, though they care little for their\r\nwives, they are inordinately fond of their children. Of their bravery\r\nIndian fighters do not speak highly: they are notoriously deficient\r\nin the civilized quality called moral courage, and, though a brave\r\nwill fight single-handed stoutly enough, they rarely stand up long in\r\naction. They are great at surprises, ambuscades, and night attacks: as\r\nwith the Arabs and Africans, their favorite hour for onslaught is that\r\nbefore dawn, when the enemy is most easily terrified--they know that\r\nthere is nothing which tries man’s nerve so much, as an unexpected\r\nnight attack--and when the cattle can be driven off to advantage. In\r\nsome points their characters have been, it is now granted, greatly\r\nmisunderstood. Their forced gravity and calmness--purely “company\r\nmanners”--were not suspected to cloak merriment, sociability, and a\r\ngeneral fondness of feasts and fun. Their apathy and sternness, which\r\nwere meant for reserve and dignity among strangers, gave them an air of\r\nungeniality which does not belong to their mental constitutions. Their\r\nfortitude and endurance of pain is the result, as in the prize-fighter,\r\nof undeveloped brain.\r\n\r\nThe Sioux are tall men, straight, and well made: they are never\r\ndeformed, and are rarely crippled, simply because none but the\r\nable-bodied can live. The shoulders are high and somewhat straight; the\r\nfigure is the reverse of the sailor’s, that is to say, while the arms\r\nare smooth, feeble, and etiolated, the legs are tolerably muscular; the\r\nbones are often crooked or bowed in the equestrian tribes; they walk\r\nas if they wanted the ligamentum teres; there is a general looseness\r\nof limb, which promises, however, lightness, endurance, and agility,\r\nand which, contrasted with the Caucasian race, suggests the gait of a\r\nwild compared with that of a tame animal. Like all savages, they are\r\ndeficient in corporeal strength: a civilized man finds no difficulty in\r\nhandling them: on this road there is only one Indian (a Shoshonee) who\r\ncan whip a white in a “rough and tumble.” The temperament is usually\r\nbilious-nervous; the sanguine is rare, the lymphatic rarer, and I never\r\nknew or heard of an albino. The hands, especially in the higher tribes,\r\nare decidedly delicate, but this is more observable in the male than in\r\nthe female; the type is rather that of the Hindoo than of the African\r\nor the European. The feet, being more used than the other extremities,\r\nand unconfined by boot or shoe, are somewhat splay, spreading out\r\nimmediately behind the toes, while the heel is remarkably narrow.\r\nIn consequence of being carried straight to the fore--the only easy\r\nposition for walking through grass--they tread, like the ant-eater,\r\nmore heavily on the outer than on the inner edge. The sign of the\r\nIndian is readily recognized by the least experienced tracker.\r\n\r\nIt is erroneously said that he who has seen a single Indian has seen\r\nthem all. Of course there is a great similarity among savages and\r\nbarbarians of the same race and climate. The same pursuits, habits,\r\nand customs naturally produce an identity of expression which, as in\r\nthe case of husband and wife, parent and child, moulds the features\r\ninto more or less of likeness. On the other hand, a practiced eye\r\nwill distinguish the Indian individually or by bands as easily as the\r\nshepherd, by marks invisible to others, can swear to his sheep. I have\r\nlittle doubt that to the savages all white men look alike.\r\n\r\n[THE INDIAN CONSTITUTION.]\r\n\r\nThe Prairie Indian’s hair and complexion have already been described.\r\nAccording to some savages the build of the former differs materially\r\nfrom that of the European and the Asiatic. The animal development\r\nvaries in the several races: the Pawnee’s and Yuta’s scalp-lock\r\nrarely exceeds eighteen inches in length, while that of the Crow,\r\nlike the East Indian Jatawala’s, often sweeps the ground. There are\r\nsalient characteristics in the cranium which bear testimony to many\r\nphrenological theories. The transverse diameter of the rounded skull\r\nbetween the parietal bones, where destructiveness and secretiveness\r\nare placed, is enormous, sometimes exceeding the longitudinal line\r\nfrom sinciput to occiput, the direct opposite of the African negro’s\r\norganization. The region of the cerebellum is deficient and shrunken,\r\nas with the European in his second childhood: it sensibly denotes that\r\nthe subject wants “vim.” The coronal region, where the sentiments are\r\nsupposed to lie, is rather flat than arched; in extreme cases the\r\nface seems to occupy two thirds instead of half the space between\r\npoll and chin. The low conical forehead recedes, as in Robespierre’s\r\nhead, from the region of benevolence, and rises high at the apex,\r\nwhere firmness and self-esteem reside: a common formation among\r\nwild tribes, as every traveler in Asia and Africa has remarked. The\r\nfacial angle of Camper varies, according to phrenologists, between\r\n70° and 80°. The projecting lower brow is strong, broad, and massive,\r\nshowing that development of the perceptions which is produced by the\r\nconstant and minute observation of a limited number of objects. The\r\nwell-known Indian art of following the trail is one result of this\r\nproperty. The nose is at once salient and dilated--in fact, partaking\r\nof the Caucasian and African types. The nostrils are broad and deeply\r\nwhorled; the nasal orifice is wide, and, according to osteologists,\r\nthe bones that protect it are arched and expanded; the eyebrows are\r\nremoved, like the beard and mustache, by vellication, giving a dull\r\nand bald look to the face; the lashes, however, grow so thickly that\r\nthey often show a sooty black line, suggesting the presence of the\r\nOriental kohl or surma. The orbits are large and square: largeness and\r\nsquareness are, in fact, the general character of the features: it\r\ndoubtless produces that peculiar besotted look which belongs to the\r\nIndian as to the Mongolian family. The conjunctival membrane has the\r\nwhiteness and clearness of the European and the Asiatic; it is not, as\r\nin the African, brown, yellow, or red. The pupil, like the hair, is of\r\ndifferent shades between black and brown: when the organ is blue--an\r\naccident which leads to a suspicion of mixed blood--the owner generally\r\nreceives a name from the peculiarity. Travelers, for the most part,\r\ndescribe the organ as “black and piercing, snaky and venomous;” others\r\nas “dull and sleepy;” while some detect in its color a mingling of\r\nblack and gray. The only peculiarity which I observed in the pupil\r\nwas its similarity to that of the gipsy. The Indian first fixes upon\r\nyou a piercing glance, which seems to look below the surface. After a\r\nfew seconds, however, the eye glazes as though a film passed over it,\r\nand gazes, as it were, on vacancy. The look would at once convict\r\nhim of Jattatura and Molocchio in Italy, and of El Ayn, or the Evil\r\nEye, in the East. The mouth is at once full and compressed; it opens\r\nwidely; the lips are generally _bordés_ or everted--decidedly the most\r\nunpleasant fault which that feature can have--the corners are drawn\r\ndown as if by ill temper, and the two seams which spring from the alæ\r\nof the nostrils are deeply traced. This formation of the oral, combined\r\nwith the fullness of the circumoral regions, and the length and\r\nfleshiness of the naked upper lip, communicates a peculiar animality\r\nto the countenance. The cheek-bones are high and bony; they are not,\r\nhowever, expanded or spread backward, nor do they, as in the Chinese,\r\nalter the appearance of the eyes by making them oblique. The cheeks\r\nare rather lank and falling in than full or oval. The whole maxillary\r\norgan is projecting and ponderous. The wide condyles of the lower jaw\r\ngive a remarkable massiveness to the jowl, while the chin--perhaps the\r\nmost characteristic feature--is long, bony, large, and often parted in\r\nthe centre. The teeth are faultless, full-sized and white, even and\r\nregular, strong and lasting; and they are vertical, not sloping forward\r\nlike the African’s. To sum up, the evanishing of the forehead, the\r\ncompression of the lips, the breadth and squareness of the jaw, and\r\nthe massiveness of the chin, combine to produce a normal expression of\r\nharshness and cruelty, which, heightened by red and black war-paint,\r\nlocks like horsehair, plumes, and other savage decorations, form a\r\n“rouge dragon” whose _tout ensemble_ is truly revolting.\r\n\r\nThe women when in their teens have often that _beauté du diable_, which\r\nmay be found even among the African negresses; nothing, however, can be\r\nmore evanescent. When full grown the figure becomes dumpy and _trapu_;\r\nand the face, though sometimes not without a certain comeliness,\r\nhas a Turanian breadth and flatness. The best portrait of a sightly\r\nIndian woman is that of Pocahontas, the Princess, published by Mr.\r\nSchoolcraft. The drudgery of the tent and field renders the squaw cold\r\nand unimpassioned; and, like the coarsest-minded women in civilized\r\nraces, her eye and her heart mean one and the same thing. She will\r\nadminister “squaw medicine,” a love philter, to her husband, but rather\r\nfor the purpose of retaining his protection than his love. She has all\r\nthe modesty of a savage, and is not deficient in sense of honor. She\r\nhas no objection to a white man, but, Affghan-like, she usually changes\r\nher name to “John” or some other alias. Her demerits are a habit of\r\ndunning for presents, and a dislike to the virtue that ranks next to\r\ngodliness, which nothing but the fear of the rod will subdue. She has\r\nliterally no belief, not even in the rude fetichism of her husband, and\r\nconsequently she has no religious exercises. As she advances in years\r\nshe rapidly descends in _physique_ and _morale_: there is nothing on\r\nearth more fiendlike than the vengeance of a cretin-like old squaw.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Persians taught their progeny archery, riding, and\r\ntruth-telling; the Prairie Indian’s curriculum is much the same, only\r\nthe last of the trio is carefully omitted. The Indian, like other\r\nsavages, never tells the truth; verity is indeed rather an intellectual\r\nthan an instinctive virtue, which, as children prove, must be taught\r\nand made intelligible; except when “counting his coups,” in other\r\nwords, recounting his triumphs, his life is therefore one system of\r\ndeceit, the strength of the weak. Another essential part of education\r\nis to close the mouth during sleep: the Indian has a superstition\r\nthat all disease is produced by inhalation. The children, “born like\r\nthe wild ass’s colts,” are systematically spoiled with the view of\r\nfostering their audacity; the celebrated apophthegm of the Wise\r\nKing--to judge from his notable failure at home, he probably did not\r\npractice what he preached--which has caused such an expenditure of\r\nbirch and cane in higher races, would be treated with contempt by the\r\nIndians. The fond mother, when chastening her child, never goes beyond\r\ndashing a little cold water in its face--for which reason to besprinkle\r\na man is a mortal insult--a system which, perhaps, might be naturalized\r\nwith advantage in some parts of Europe. The son is taught to make his\r\nmother toil for him, and openly to disobey his sire; at seven years\r\nof age he has thrown off all parental restraint; nothing keeps him in\r\norder but the fear of the young warriors. At ten or twelve he openly\r\nrebels against all domestic rule, and does not hesitate to strike his\r\nfather; the parent then goes off rubbing his hurt, and boasting to his\r\nneighbors of the brave boy whom he has begotten.\r\n\r\n[THE INDIAN’S RELIGION.]\r\n\r\nThe religion of the North American Indians has long been a subject of\r\ndebate. Some see in it traces of Judaism, others of Sabæanism; Mr.\r\nSchoolcraft detects a degradation of Guebrism. His faith has, it is\r\ntrue, a suspicion of duality; Hormuzd and Ahriman are recognizable\r\nin Gitche Manitou and Mujhe Manitou, and the latter, the Bad god, is\r\nnaturally more worshiped, because more feared, than the Good god.\r\nMoreover, some tribes show respect for and swear by the sun, and\r\nothers for fire: there is a north god and a south god, a wood god, a\r\nprairie god, an air god, and a water god; but--they have not risen\r\nto monotheism--there is not one God. None, however, appear to have\r\nthat reverence for the elements which is the first article of the\r\nZoroastrian creed; the points of difference are many, while those\r\nof resemblance are few and feeble, and it is hard to doubt that the\r\ninstincts of mankind have been pressed by controversialists into the\r\nservice of argument as traditional tenets.\r\n\r\nTo judge from books and the conversation of those who best know the\r\nIndians, he is distinctly a Fetichist like the African negro, and,\r\nindeed, like all the child-like races of mankind.[66] The medicine-man\r\nis his mganga, angekok, sorcerer, prophet, physician, exorciser,\r\npriest, and rain-doctor; only, as he is rarely a cultivator of the\r\nsoil, instead of heavy showers and copious crops, he is promised\r\nscalps, salmon trout, and buffalo beef in plenty. He has the true\r\nFetichist’s belief--invariably found in tribes who live dependent\r\nupon the powers of Nature--in the younger brothers of the human\r\nfamily, the bestial creation: he holds to a metamorphosis like that\r\nof Abyssinia, and to speaking animals. Every warrior chooses a totem,\r\nsome quadruped, bird, or fish, to which he prays, and which he will\r\non no account kill or eat. Dr. Livingstone shows (chap. i.) that the\r\nsame custom prevails in its entirety among the Kaffir Bakwaina, and\r\nopines that it shows traces of addiction to animal worship, like the\r\nancient Egyptians; in the prophecies of Israel the tribes are compared\r\nwith animals, a true totemic practice. The word totem also signifies a\r\nsub-clan or sub-tribe; and some nations, like the African Somal, will\r\nnot allow marriage in the same totem. The medicine-men give away young\r\nchildren as an atonement when calamities impend: they go clothed, not\r\nin sackcloth and ashes, but in coats of mire, and their macerations\r\nand self-inflicted tortures rival those of the Hindoos: a fanatic has\r\nbeen known to drag about a buffalo skull with a string cut from his own\r\nskin till it is torn away. In spring-time, the braves, and even the\r\nboys, repairing to lonely places and hill-tops, their faces and bodies\r\nbeing masked, as if in mourning, with mud, fast and pray, and sing rude\r\nchants to propitiate the ghosts for days consecutively. The Fetichist\r\nis ever grossly superstitious; and the Indians, as might be expected,\r\nabound in local rites. Some tribes, as the Cheyennes, will not go\r\nto war without a medicine-man, others without sacred war-gourds[67]\r\ncontaining the tooth of the drum-head fish. Children born with teeth\r\nare looked upon as portents, and when gray at birth the phenomenon is\r\nattributed to evil ghosts.\r\n\r\n  [66] The reader who cares to consult my studies upon the subject\r\n  of Fetichism in Africa, where it is and ever has been the national\r\n  creed, is referred to “The Lake Regions of Central Africa,” chap.\r\n  xix. The modes of belief, and the manners and customs of savage and\r\n  barbarous races are so similar, that a knowledge of the African is an\r\n  excellent introduction to that of the American.\r\n\r\n  [67] This gourd or calabash is the produce of the _Cucurbita\r\n  lagenaria_, or calabash vine. In Spanish, Central, and Southern\r\n  America, Cuba and the West Indies, they use the large round fruit of\r\n  the _Crescentia cujete_.\r\n\r\nI can not but think that the two main articles of belief which have\r\nbeen set down to the credit of the Indian, namely, the Great Spirit\r\nor Creator, and the Happy Hunting-grounds in a future world, are\r\nthe results of missionary teaching, the work of Fathers Hennepin,\r\nMarquette, and their noble army of martyred Jesuit followers. In later\r\ndays they served chiefly to inspire the Anglo-American muse, _e. g._:\r\n\r\n    “By midnight moons o’er moistening dews,\r\n      In vestments for the chase arrayed,\r\n    The hunter still the deer pursues--\r\n      The hunter and the deer, a shade!\r\n\r\n    And long shall timorous fancy see\r\n      The painted chief and pointed spear,\r\n    And Reason’s self shall bow the knee\r\n      To shadows and delusions here.”\r\n\r\nMy conviction is, that the English and American’s popular ideas upon\r\nthe subject are unreliable, and that their embodiment, beautiful\r\npoetry, “Lo the poor Indian,” down to “his faithful dog shall bear\r\nhim company,” are but a splendid myth. The North American aborigine\r\nbelieved, it is true, in an unseen power, the Manitou, or, as we are\r\nobliged to translate it, “Spirit,” residing in every heavenly body,\r\nanimal, plant, or other natural object. This is the very essence of\r\nthat form of Fetichism which leads to Pantheism and Polytheism. There\r\nwas a Manitou, as he conceived, which gave the spark from the flint,\r\nlived in every blade of grass, flowed in the streams, shone in the\r\nstars, and thundered in the waterfall; but in each example--a notable\r\ninstance of the want of abstractive and generalizing power--the idea\r\nof the Deity was particular and concrete. When the Jesuit fathers\r\nsuggested the unity of the Great Spirit pervading all beings, it was\r\nvery readily recognized; but the generalization was not worked out by\r\nthe Indian mind. He was, therefore, like all savages, atheistic in\r\nthe literal sense of the word. He had not arrived at the first step,\r\nPantheism, which is so far an improvement that it opens out a grand\r\nidea, the omnipresence, and consequently the omnipotence, of the\r\nDeity. In most North American languages the Theos is known, not as the\r\n“Great Spirit,” but as the “Great Father,” a title also applied to the\r\nPresident of the United States, who is, I believe, though sometimes a\r\nstep-father, rather the more reverenced of the twain. With respect to\r\nthe happy hunting-grounds, it is a mere corollary of the monotheistic\r\ntheorem above proved. It is doubtful whether these savages ever grasped\r\nthe idea of a human soul. The Chicury of New England, indeed, and other\r\nnative words so anglicized, appear distinctly to mean the African\r\nPepo--ghost or larva.\r\n\r\nCertain missionaries have left us grotesque accounts of the simple\r\ngood sense with which the Indians of old received the Glad Tidings.\r\nThe strangers were courteously received, the calumet was passed round,\r\nand they were invited to make known their wants in a “big talk.” They\r\ndid so by producing a synopsis of their faith, beginning at Adam’s\r\napple and ending at the Savior’s cross. The patience of the Indian in\r\nenduring long speeches, sermons, and harangues has ever been exemplary\r\nand peculiar, as his fortitude in suffering lingering physical\r\ntortures. The audience listened with a solemn demeanor, not once\r\ninterrupting what must have appeared to them a very wild and curious\r\nstory. Called upon to make some remark, these antipomologists simply\r\nejaculated,\r\n\r\n“Apples are not wholesome, and those who crucified Christ were bad\r\nmen!”\r\n\r\nIn their turn, some display of oratory was required. They avoided the\r\ntedious, long-drawn style of argument, and spoke, as was their wont,\r\nbriefly to the point. “It is good of you,” said they, “to cross the\r\nbig water, and to follow the Indian’s trail, that ye may relate to us\r\nwhat ye have related. Now listen to what our mothers told us. Our first\r\nfather, after killing a beast, was roasting a rib before the fire, when\r\na spirit, descending from the skies, sat upon a neighboring bluff. She\r\nwas asked to eat. She ate fat meat. Then she arose and silently went\r\nher way. From the place where she rested her two hands grew corn and\r\npumpkin; and from the place where she sat sprang tobacco!”\r\n\r\nThe missionaries listened to the savage tradition with an excusable\r\ndisrespect, and, not unnaturally, often interrupted it. This want of\r\npatience and dignity, however, drew upon them severe remarks. “Pooh!”\r\nobserved the Indians. “When you told us what your mothers told you, we\r\ngave ear in silence like men. When we tell you what our mothers told\r\nus, ye give tongue like squaws. Go to! Ye are no medicine-men, but\r\nsilly fellows!”\r\n\r\nBesides their superstitious belief in ghosts, spirits, or familiars,\r\nand the practice of spells and charms, love-philters, dreams\r\nand visions, war-medicine, hunting-medicine, self-torture, and\r\nincantations, the Indians had, it appears to me, but three religious\r\nobservances, viz., dancing, smoking, and scalping.\r\n\r\nThe war-dances, the corn-dances, the buffalo-dances, the scalp-dances,\r\nand the other multiform and solemn saltations of these savages, have\r\nbeen minutely depicted and described by many competent observers. The\r\ntheme also is beyond the limits of an essay like this.\r\n\r\nSmoking is a boon which the Old owes to the New World. It is a heavy\r\ncall upon our gratitude, for which we have naturally been very\r\nungrateful.\r\n\r\n    “Non epulis tantum, non Bacchi pascimur usu,\r\n      Pascimur et fumis, ingeniosa gula est.”\r\n\r\n[THE SMOKING RITE.]\r\n\r\nWe began by calling our new gift the “holy herb;” it is now, like the\r\nBalm of Gilead, entitled, I believe, a weed. Among the North American\r\nIndians even the spirits smoke; the “Indian summer” is supposed to\r\narise from the puffs that proceed from the pipe of Nanabozhoo, the\r\nOjibwa Noah. The pipe may have been used in the East before the days\r\nof tobacco, but if so it was probably applied to the inhalation of\r\ncannabis and other intoxicants.[68] On the other hand, the Indian had\r\nno stimulants. He never invented the beer of Osiris, though maize\r\ngrew abundantly around him;[69] the koumiss of the Tartar was beyond\r\nhis mental reach; and though “Jimsen weed”[70] overruns the land,\r\nhe neglected its valuable intoxicating properties. His is almost the\r\nonly race that has ever existed wholly without a stimulant; the fact\r\nis a strong proof of its autochthonic origin. It is indeed incredible\r\nthat man, having once learned, should ever forget the means of getting\r\ndrunk. Instead of the social cup the Indian smoked. As tobacco does\r\nnot grow throughout the continent, he invented kinnikinik. This Indian\r\nword has many meanings. By the hunters and settlers it is applied to a\r\nmixture of half and half, or two thirds tobacco and one of red willow\r\nbark; others use it for a mixture of tobacco, sumach leaves, and willow\r\nrind; others, like Ruxton (“Life in the Far West,” p. 116), for the\r\ncortex of the willow only. This tree grows abundantly in copses near\r\nthe streams and water-courses. For smoking, the twigs are cut when the\r\nleaves begin to redden. Some tribes, like the Sioux, remove the outer\r\nand use only the highly-colored inner bark; others again, like the\r\nShoshonees, employ the external as well as the internal cuticle. It is\r\nscraped down the twig in curling ringlets, without, however, stripping\r\nit off; the stick is then planted in the ground before the fire,\r\nand, when sufficiently parched, the material is bruised, comminuted,\r\nand made ready for use. The taste is pleasant and aromatic, but the\r\neffect is that of the puerile ratan rather than the manly tobacco. The\r\nIndian, be it observed, smokes like all savages by inhaling the fumes\r\ninto the lungs, and returning them through the nostrils; he finds pure\r\ntobacco, therefore, too strong and pungent. As has been said, he is\r\ncatholic in his habits of smoking; he employs indifferently rose-bark\r\n(_Rosa blanda?_)[71] and the cuticle of a cornus, the lobelia,[72] the\r\nlarb, a vaccinium, a Daphne-like plant, and many others. The Indian\r\nsmokes incessantly, and the “calumet”[73] is an important part of his\r\nhousehold goods. He has many superstitions about the practice. It is\r\na sacred instrument, and its red color typifies the smoker’s flesh.\r\nThe Western travelers mention offerings of tobacco to, and smoking of\r\npipes in honor of, the Great Spirit. Some men will vow never to use the\r\npipe in public, others to abstain on particular days. Some will not\r\nsmoke with their moccasins on, others with steel about their persons;\r\nsome are pledged to abstain inside, others outside the wigwam, and\r\nmany scatter buffalo chip over their tobacco. When beginning to smoke\r\nthere are certain observances; some, _exempli gratiâ_, direct, after\r\nthe fashion of Gitche Manitou, the first puff upward or heavenward,\r\nthe second earthward, and the third and fourth over the right and left\r\nshoulders, probably in propitiation of the ghosts, who are being smoked\r\nfor in proxy; others, before the process of inhaling, touch the ground\r\nwith the heel of the pipe-bowl, and turn the stem upward and averted.\r\n\r\n  [68] The word tobacco (West Indian, tobago or tobacco, a peculiar\r\n  pipe), which has spread through Europe, Asia, and Africa, seems to\r\n  prove the origin of the nicotiana, and the non-mention of smoking\r\n  in the “Arabian Nights” disproves the habit of inhaling any other\r\n  succedaneum.\r\n\r\n  [69] It has long been disputed whether maize was indigenous to\r\n  America or to Asia; learned names are found on both sides of the\r\n  question. In Central Africa the cereal is now called as in English,\r\n  “Indian corn,” proving that in that continent it first was introduced\r\n  from Hindostan. The Italians have named it Gran’ Turco, showing\r\n  whence it was imported by them. The word maiz, mays, maize, or\r\n  mahiz, is a Carib word introduced by the Spaniards into Europe;\r\n  in the United States, where “corn” is universally used, maize is\r\n  intelligible only to the educated.\r\n\r\n  [70] Properly Jamestown weed, the _Datura stramonium_, the English\r\n  thorn-apple, unprettily called in the Northern States of America\r\n  “stinkweed.” It found its way into the higher latitudes from\r\n  Jamestown (Virginia), where it was first observed springing on heaps\r\n  of ballast and other rubbish discharged from vessels. According to\r\n  Beverly (“History of Virginia,” book ii., quoted by Mr. Bartlett),\r\n  it is “one of the greatest coolers in the world;” and in some young\r\n  soldiers who ate plentifully of it as a salad, to pacify the troubles\r\n  of bacon, the effect was “a very pleasant remedy, for they turned\r\n  natural fools upon it for several days.”\r\n\r\n  [71] The wild rose is every where met with growing in bouquets on the\r\n  prairies.\r\n\r\n  [72] The _Lobelia inflata_, or Indian tobacco, is corrupted by the\r\n  ignorant Western man to low belia in contradistinction to high belia,\r\n  better varieties of the plant.\r\n\r\n  [73] The calumet, a word introduced by the old French, is the red\r\n  sandstone pipe, described in a previous page, with a long tube,\r\n  generally a reed, adorned with feathers. It is the Indian symbol of\r\n  hatred or amity; there is a calumet of war as well as a calumet of\r\n  peace. To accept the calumet is to come to terms; to refuse it is\r\n  to reject them. The same is expressed by burying and digging up the\r\n  tomahawk or hatchet. The tomahawk and calumet are sometimes made of\r\n  one piece of stone; specimens, however, have become very rare since\r\n  the introduction of the iron axe. The “Song of Hiawatha” (Canto\r\n  I., The Peace Pipe) and the interesting “Letters and Notes on the\r\n  Manners, Customs, and Conditions of the North American Indians” (vol.\r\n  ii., p. 160), have made the Red Pipe-stone Quarry familiar to the\r\n  Englishman.\r\n\r\n[THE SCALPING RITE.]\r\n\r\nAccording to those who, like Pennant, derive the North American from\r\nthe Scythians, scalping is a practice that originated in High and\r\nNortheastern Asia. The words of the Father of History are as follows:\r\n“Of the first enemy a Scythian sends down, he quaffs the blood; he\r\ncarries the heads of all that he has slain in battle to the king;\r\nfor when he has brought a head, he is entitled to a share of the\r\nbooty that may be taken--not otherwise; to skin the head, he makes\r\na circular incision from ear to ear, and then, laying hold of the\r\ncrown, shakes out the skull; after scraping off the flesh with an\r\nox’s rib, he rumples it between his hands, and having thus softened\r\nthe skin, makes use of it as a napkin; he appends it to the bridle\r\nof the horse he rides, and prides himself on this, for the Scythian\r\nthat has most of these skin napkins is adjudged the best man, etc.,\r\netc. They also use the entire skins as horse-cloths, also the skulls\r\nfor drinking-cups.”--(“Melpomene,” iv., 64, Laurent’s trans.) The\r\nunderlying idea is doubtless the natural wish to preserve a memorial of\r\na foeman done to death, and at the same time to dishonor his hateful\r\ncorpse by mutilation. Fashion and tradition regulate the portions of\r\nthe human frame preferred.\r\n\r\nScalping is generally, but falsely, supposed to be a peculiarly\r\nAmerican practice. The Abbé Em. Domenech (“Seven Years’ Residence\r\nin the Great Deserts of North America,” chap. xxxix.) quotes the\r\n_decalvare_ of the ancient Germans, the _capillos et cutem detrahere_\r\nof the code of the Visigoths, and the annals of Flude, which prove that\r\nthe “Anglo-Saxons” and the Franks still scalped about A.D. 879. And as\r\nthe modern American practice is traceable to Europe and Asia, so it\r\nmay be found in Africa, where aught of ferocity is rarely wanting. “In\r\na short time after our return,” says Mr. Duncan (“Travels in Western\r\nAfrica in 1845 and 1846”), “the Apadomey regiment passed, on their\r\nreturn, in single file, each leading in a string a young male or female\r\nslave, carrying also the dried scalp of one man supposed to have been\r\nkilled in the attack. On all such occasions, when a person is killed in\r\nbattle, the skin is taken from the head and kept as a trophy of valor.\r\nIt must not be supposed that these female warriors kill according to\r\nthe number of scalps presented; the scalps are the accumulation of\r\nmany years. If six or seven men are killed during one year’s war it is\r\ndeemed a great thing; one party always run away in these slave-hunts;\r\nbut where armies meet the slaughter is great. I counted 700 scalps\r\npass in this manner.” But mutilation, like cannibalism, tattooing, and\r\nburying in barrows, is so natural under certain circumstances to man’s\r\nmind that we distinctly require no traditional derivation.\r\n\r\nScalp-taking is a solemn rite. In the good old times braves\r\nscrupulously awaited the wounded man’s death before they “raised his\r\nhair;” in the laxity of modern days, however, this humane custom is too\r\noften disregarded. Properly speaking, the trophy should be taken after\r\nfair fight with a hostile warrior; this also is now neglected. When\r\nthe Indian sees his enemy fall he draws his scalp-knife--the modern is\r\nof iron, formerly it was of flint, obsidian, or other hard stone--and\r\ntwisting the scalp-lock, which is left long for that purpose, and\r\nboastfully braided or decorated with some gaudy ribbon or with the\r\nwar-eagle’s plume, round his left hand, makes with the right two\r\nsemicircular incisions, with and against the sun, about the part to be\r\nremoved. The skin is next loosened with the knife-point, if there be\r\ntime to spare and if there be much scalp to be taken. The operator then\r\nsits on the ground, places his feet against the subject’s shoulders\r\nby way of leverage, and, holding the scalp-lock with both hands, he\r\napplies a strain which soon brings off the spoils with a sound which,\r\nI am told, is not unlike “flop.” Without the long lock it would be\r\ndifficult to remove the scalp; prudent white travelers, therefore, are\r\ncareful, before setting out through an Indian country, to “shingle\r\noff” their hair as closely as possible; the Indian, moreover, hardly\r\ncares for a half-fledged scalp. To judge from the long love-locks\r\naffected by the hunter and mountaineer, he seems to think lightly of\r\nthis precaution; to hold it, in fact, a point of honor that the savage\r\nshould have a fair chance. A few cunning men have surprised their\r\nadversaries with wigs. The operation of scalping must be exceedingly\r\npainful; the sufferer turns, wriggles, and “squirms” upon the ground\r\nlike a scotched snake. It is supposed to induce brain fever; many\r\ninstances, however, are known of men and even women recovering from\r\nit, as the former do from a more dreadful infliction in Abyssinia and\r\nGalla-land; cases are of course rare, as a disabling wound is generally\r\ninflicted before the bloodier work is done.\r\n\r\nAfter taking the scalp, the Indian warrior--proud as if he had won\r\na _médaille de sauvetage_--prepares for return to his village. He\r\nlingers outside for a few days, and then, after painting his hands and\r\nface with lampblack, appears slowly and silently before his lodge.\r\nThere he squats for a while; his relatives and friends, accompanied by\r\nthe elders of the tribe, sit with him dumb as himself. Presently the\r\nquestion is put; it is answered with truth, although these warriors at\r\nother times will lie like Cretans. The “coup” is recounted, however,\r\nwith abundant glorification; the Indians, like the Greek and Arab of\r\ntheir classical ages, are allowed to vent their self-esteem on such\r\noccasions without blame, and to enjoy a treat for which the civilized\r\nmodern hero longs ardently, but in vain. Finally the “green scalp,”\r\nafter being dried and mounted, is consecrated by the solemn dance, and\r\nbecomes then fit for public exhibition. Some tribes attach it to a long\r\npole used as a standard, and others to their horses’ bridles, others\r\nto their targes, while others ornament with its fringes the outer\r\nseams of their leggins; in fact, its uses are many. The more scalps\r\nthe more honor; the young man who can not boast of a single murder or\r\nshow the coveted trophy is held in such scant esteem as the English\r\ngentleman who contents himself with being passing rich on a hundred\r\npounds a year. Some great war-chiefs have collected a heap of these\r\nhonorable spoils. It must be remembered by “curio” hunters that only\r\none scalp can come off one head; namely, the centre lock or long tuft\r\ngrowing upon the coronal apex, with about three inches in diameter of\r\nskin. This knowledge is the more needful, as the Western men are in the\r\nhabit of manufacturing half a dozen cut from different parts of the\r\nsame head; they sell readily for $50 each, but the transaction is not\r\nconsidered reputable. The connoisseur, however, readily distinguishes\r\nthe real article from “false scalping” by the unusual thickness of\r\nthe cutis, which is more like that of a donkey than of a man. Set in\r\na plain gold circlet it makes a very pretty brooch. Moreover, each\r\ntribe has its own fashion of scalping derived from its forefathers. The\r\nSioux, for instance, when they have leisure to perform the operation,\r\nremove the whole headskin, including a portion of the ears; they then\r\nsit down and dispose the ears upon the horns of a buffalo skull, and\r\na bit of the flesh upon little heaps of earth or clay, disposed in\r\nquincunx, apparently as an offering to the manes of their ancestors,\r\nand they smoke ceremoniously, begging the manitou to send them plenty\r\nmore. The trophy is then stretched upon a willow twig bent into an\r\noval shape, and lined with two semi-ovals of black or blue and scarlet\r\ncloth. The Yutas and the Prairie tribes generally, when pressed for\r\ntime, merely take off the poll skin that grows the long tuft of hair,\r\nwhile the Chyuagara or Nez Percés prefer a long strip about two inches\r\nwide, extending from the nape to the commissure of the hair and\r\nforehead. The fingers of the slain are often reserved for sévignés\r\nand necklaces. Indians are aware of the aversion with which the pale\r\nfaces regard this barbarity. Near Alkali Lake, where there was a large\r\nDakotah “tipi” or encampment of Sioux, I tried to induce a tribesman to\r\ngo through the imitative process before me; he refused with a gesture\r\nindignantly repudiating the practice. A glass of whisky would doubtless\r\nhave changed his mind, but I was unwilling to break through the\r\nwholesome law that prohibits it.\r\n\r\nIt is not wonderful that the modern missionary should be unable to\r\ninfluence such a brain as the Prairie Indian’s. The old propagandists,\r\nJesuits and Franciscans, became medicine-men: like the great fraternity\r\nin India, they succeeded by the points of resemblance which the savages\r\nremarked in their observances, such as their images and rosaries, which\r\nwould be regarded as totems, and their fastings and prayers, which\r\nwere of course supposed to be spells and charms. Their successors\r\nhave succeeded about as well with the Indian as with the African; the\r\nsettled tribes have given ear to them, the Prairie wanderers have not;\r\nand the Europeanization of the Indian generally is hopeless as the\r\nChristianization of the Hindoo. The missionaries usually live under the\r\nshadow of the different agencies, and even they own that nothing can be\r\ndone with the children unless removed from the parental influence. I do\r\nnot believe that an Indian of the plains ever became a Christian. He\r\nmust first be humanized, then civilized, and lastly Christianized; and,\r\nas has been said before, I doubt his surviving the operation.\r\n\r\n[INDIAN NAMES.]\r\n\r\nAs might be expected of the Indian’s creed, it has few rites and\r\nceremonies; circumcision is unknown, and it ignores the complicated\r\nobservances which, in the case of the Hindoo Pantheist, and in many\r\nAfrican tribes, wait upon gestation, parturition, and allactation. The\r\nchild is seldom named.[74] There are but five words given in regular\r\norder to distinguish one from another. There are no family names. The\r\nmen, after notable exploits, are entitled by their tribes to assume\r\nthe titles of the distinguished dead, and each fresh deed brings a\r\nnew distinction. Some of the names are poetical enough: the “Black\r\nNight,” for instance, the “Breaker of Arrows,” or the “War Eagle’s\r\nWing;” others are coarse and ridiculous, such as “Squash-head,”\r\n“Bull’s-tail,” “Dirty Saddle,” and “Steam from a Cow’s Belly;” not a\r\nfew bear a whimsical likeness to those of the African negroes, as “His\r\nGreat Fire,” “The Water goes in the Path,” and “Buffalo Chips”--the\r\n“Mavi yá Gnombe” of Unyamwezi. The son of a chief succeeding his\r\nfather usually assumes his name, so that the little dynasty, like that\r\nof the Pharaohs, the Romuli, or the Numas, is perpetuated. The women\r\nare not unfrequently called after the parts and properties of some\r\nadmired or valued animal, as the White Martin, the Young Mink,[75] or\r\nthe Muskrat’s Paw. In the north there have been men with as many as\r\nseven wives, all “Martins.” The Prairie Indians form the names of the\r\nwomen like those of men, adding the feminine suffix, as Cloud-woman,\r\nRed-earth-woman, Black-day-woman. The white stranger is ever offending\r\nIndian etiquette by asking the savage “What’s your name?” The person\r\nasked looks aside for a friend to assist him; he has learned in boyhood\r\nthat some misfortune will happen to him if he discloses his name. Even\r\nhusbands and wives never mention each other’s names. The same practice\r\nprevails in many parts of Asia.\r\n\r\n  [74] The Ojibwa and other races have the ceremony of a burnt-offering\r\n  when the name is given.\r\n\r\n  [75] Putorius vison, a pretty dark-chestnut-colored animal of the\r\n  weasel kind, which burrows in the banks of streams near mills and\r\n  farm-houses, where it preys upon the poultry like the rest of the\r\n  family. It swims well, and can dive for a long time. Its food is\r\n  small fish, mussels, and insects, but it will also devour rats and\r\n  mice.\r\n\r\n[FEMALE CONDUCT.]\r\n\r\nMarriage is a simple affair with them. In some tribes the bride, as\r\namong the Australians, is carried off by force. In others the man\r\nwho wants a wife courts her with a little present, and pickets near\r\nthe father’s lodge the number of horses which he supposes to be her\r\nequivalent. As among all savage tribes, the daughter is a chattel, an\r\nitem of her father’s goods, and he will not part with her except for a\r\nconsideration. The men are of course polygamists; they prefer to marry\r\nsisters, because the tent is more quiet, and much upon the principle\r\nwith which marriage with a deceased wife’s sister is advocated in\r\nEngland. The women, like the Africans, are not a little addicted to\r\nsuicide. Before espousal the conduct of the weaker sex in many tribes\r\nis far from irreproachable. The “bundling” of Wales and of New England\r\nin a former day[76] is not unknown to them, and many think little of\r\nthat _prœgustatio matrimonii_ which, in the eastern parts of the New\r\nWorld, goes by the name of Fanny Wrightism and Free-loveism. Several\r\ntribes make trial, like the Highlanders before the reign of James the\r\nFifth, of their wives for a certain time--a kind of “hand-fasting,”\r\nwhich is to morality what fetichism is to faith. There are few nations\r\nin the world among whom this practice, originating in a natural desire\r\nnot to “make a leap in the dark,” can not be traced. Yet after marriage\r\nthey will live, like the Spartan matrons, a life of austerity in\r\nrelation to the other sex. In cases of divorce, the children, being\r\nproperty, are divided, and in most tribes the wife claims the odd one.\r\nIf the mother takes any care to preserve her daughter’s virtue, it is\r\nonly out of regard to its market value. In some tribes the injured\r\nhusband displays all the philosophy of Cato and Socrates. In others\r\nthe wife is punished, like the native of Hindostan, by cutting, or,\r\nmore generally, by biting off the nose-tip. Some slay the wife’s lover;\r\nothers accept a pecuniary compensation for their dishonor, and take\r\nas damages skins or horses. Elopement, as among the Arabs, prevails\r\nin places. The difference of conduct on the part of the women of\r\ncourse depends upon the bearing of the men. “There is no adulteress\r\nwithout an adulterer”--meaning that the husband is ever the first to\r\nbe unfaithful--is a saying as old as the days of Mohammed. Among the\r\nArapahoes, for instance, there is great looseness; the Cheyennes,\r\non the contrary, are notably correct. Truth demands one unpleasant\r\nconfession, viz., on the whole, chastity is little esteemed among those\r\nIndians who have been corrupted by intercourse with whites.\r\n\r\n  [76] Traces of this ancient practice may be found in the four\r\n  quarters of the globe. Mr.Bartlett, in his instructive volume, quotes\r\n  the Rev. Samuel Pike (“General History of Connecticut,” London,\r\n  1781), who quaintly remarks: “Notwithstanding the great modesty of\r\n  the females is such that it would be accounted the greatest rudeness\r\n  for a gentleman to speak before a lady of a garter or a leg, yet\r\n  it is thought but a piece of civility to ask her to _bundle_.” The\r\n  learned and pious historian endeavored to prove that bundling was\r\n  not only a Christian, but a very polite and prudent practice. So the\r\n  Rev. Andrew Barnaby, who traveled in New England in 1759-60, thinks\r\n  that though bundling may “at first appear the effect of grossness of\r\n  character, it will, upon deeper research, be found to proceed from\r\n  simplicity and innocence.”\r\n\r\n[CHIEFS.]\r\n\r\nThe dignity of chief denotes in the Indian language a royal title.\r\nIt is hereditary as a rule, but men of low birth sometimes attain\r\nit by winning a name as warriors or medicine-men. When there are\r\nmany sons it often happens that each takes command of a small clan.\r\nPersonal prowess is a necessity in sagamore and sachem: an old man,\r\ntherefore, often abdicates in favor of his more vigorous son, to whom\r\nhe acts as guide and counselor. There is one chief to every band,\r\nwith several sub-chiefs. The power possessed by the ruler depends\r\nupon his individual character, and the greater or lesser capacity for\r\ndiscipline in his subjects. Some are obeyed grudgingly, as the Sheikh\r\nof a Bedouin tribe. Others are absolute monarchs, who dispose of the\r\nlives and properties of their followers without exciting a murmur. The\r\ncounteracting element to despotism resides in the sub-chief and in the\r\ncouncil of warriors, who obstinately insist upon having a voice in\r\nmaking laws, raising subsidies, declaring wars, and ratifying peace.\r\n\r\n[MODE OF LIFE.]\r\n\r\nTheir life is of course simple; they have no regular hours for meals\r\nor sleep. Before eating they sometimes make a heave-offering of a\r\nbit of food toward the heavens, where their forefathers are, and a\r\nsecond toward the earth, the mother of all things: the pieces are then\r\nburned. They are not cannibals, except when a warrior, after slaying\r\na foe, eats, porcupine-like, the heart or liver, with the idea of\r\nincreasing his own courage. The women rarely sit at meals with the\r\nmen. In savage and semi-barbarous societies the separation of the\r\nsexes is the general rule, because, as they have no ideas in common,\r\neach prefers the society of its own. They are fond of adoption and\r\nof making brotherhoods, like the Africans; and so strong is the tie,\r\nthat marriage with the sister of an adopted brother is within the\r\nprohibited degrees. Gambling is a passion with them: they play at\r\ncards, an art probably learned from the Canadians, and the game is\r\nthat called in the States “matching,” on the principle of dominoes or\r\nbeggar-my-neighbor. When excited they ejaculate Will! Will!--sharp and\r\nstaccato--it is possibly a conception of the English well. But it often\r\ncomes out in the place of bad, as the Sepoy orderly in India reports\r\nto his captain, “Ramnak Jamnak dead, Joti Prasad very sick--all vell!”\r\nThe savages win and lose with the stoicism habitual to them, rarely\r\ndrawing the “navajon,” like the Mexican “lepero,” over a disputed\r\npoint; and when a man has lost his last rag, he rises in nude dignity\r\nand goes home. Their language ignores the violent and offensive abuse\r\nof parents and female relatives, which distinguishes the Asiatic and\r\nthe African from the European Billingsgate: the worst epithets that\r\ncan be applied to a man are miser, coward, dog, woman. With them good\r\ntemper is good breeding--a mark of gentle blood. A brave will stand\r\nup and harangue his enemies, exulting how he scalped their sires, and\r\nsquaws, and sons, without calling forth a grunt of irritation. Ceremony\r\nand manners, in our sense of the word, they have none, and they lack\r\nthe profusion of salutations which usually distinguishes barbarians.\r\nAn Indian appearing at your door rarely has the civility to wait till\r\nbeckoned in; he enters the house, with his quiet catlike gait and his\r\nimperturbable countenance, saying, if a Sioux, “How!” or “How! How!”\r\nmeaning Well? shakes hands, to which he expects the same reply, if he\r\nhas learned “paddling with the palms” from the whites--this, however,\r\nis only expected by the chiefs and braves--and squats upon his hams in\r\nthe Eastern way, I had almost said the natural way, but to man, unlike\r\nall other animals, every way is equally natural, the chair or the seat\r\nupon the ground. He accepts a pipe if offered to him, devours what you\r\nset before him--those best acquainted with the savage, however, avoid\r\nall unnecessary civility or generosity: Milesian-like, he considers a\r\nbenefit his due, and if withheld, he looks upon his benefactor as a\r\n“mean man”--talks or smokes as long as he pleases, and then rising,\r\nstalks off without a word. His ideas of time are primitive. The hour is\r\ndenoted by pointing out the position of the sun; the days, or rather\r\nthe nights, are reckoned by sleeps; there are no weeks; the moons,\r\nwhich are literally new, the old being nibbled away by mice, form the\r\nmonths, and suns do duty for years. He has, like the Bedouin and the\r\nEsquimaux, sufficient knowledge of the heavenly bodies to steer his\r\ncourse over the pathless sage-sea. Night-work, however, is no favorite\r\nwith him except in cases of absolute necessity. Counting is done upon\r\nman’s first abacus, the fingers, and it rarely extends beyond ten. The\r\nvalue of an article was formerly determined by beads and buffaloes;\r\ndollars, however, are now beginning to be generally known.\r\n\r\nThe only arts of the Indians are medicine and the use of arms. They are\r\ngreat in the knowledge of simples and tisanes. The leaves of the white\r\nwillow are the favorite emetic; wounds are dressed with astringent\r\nherbs, and inflammations are reduced by scarification and the actual\r\ncautery. Among some tribes, the hammam, or Turkish bath, is invariably\r\nthe appendage to a village. It is an oven sunk in the earth, with\r\nroom for about a score of persons, and a domed roof of tamped and\r\ntimber-propped earth--often mistaken for a bulge in the ground--pierced\r\nwith a little square window for ventilation when not in use. A fire is\r\nkindled in the centre, and the patient, after excluding the air, sits\r\nquietly in this rude calidarium till half roasted and stifled by the\r\nheat and smoke. Finally, like the Russian peasant, he plunges into the\r\nburn that runs hard by, and feels his ailments dropping off him with\r\nthe dead cuticle. The Indians associating with the horse have learned a\r\nrude farriery which often succeeds where politer practice would fail.\r\nI heard of one who cured the bites of rattlesnakes and copperheads by\r\nscarifying the wounded beast’s face, plastering the place with damped\r\ngunpowder paste and setting it on fire.\r\n\r\n[FIRE-ARMS.--BOWS AND ARROWS.]\r\n\r\nAmong the Prairie tribes are now to be found individuals provided\r\nnot only with the old muskets formerly supplied to them, but with\r\nyägers,[77] Sharp’s breech-loaders, alias “Beecher’s Bibles,” Colt’s\r\nrevolvers, and other really good fire-arms. Their shooting has improved\r\nwith their tools: many of them are now able to “draw a bead” with\r\ncoolness and certainty. Those who can not afford shooting-irons content\r\nthemselves with their ancient weapons, the lance and bow. The former\r\nis a poor affair, a mere iron spike from two to three inches long,\r\ninserted into the end of a staff about as thick as a Hindostanee’s\r\nbamboo lance; it is whipped round with sinew for strength, decorated\r\nwith a few bunches of gaudy feathers, and defended with the usual\r\nmedicine-bag. The bow varies in dimensions with the different tribes.\r\nOn the prairies, for convenient use on horseback, it seldom exceeds\r\nthree feet in length; among the Southern Indians its size doubles, and\r\nin parts of South America it is like that of the Andamans, a gigantic\r\nweapon with an arrow six feet long, and drawn by bringing the aid of\r\nthe feet to the hands. The best bows among the Sioux and Yutas are of\r\nhorn, hickory being unprocurable; an inferior sort is made of a reddish\r\nwood, in hue and grain not unlike that called “mountain mahogany.” A\r\nstrip of raw-hide is fitted to the back for increase of elasticity,\r\nand the string is a line of twisted sinew. When not wanted for use\r\nthe weapon is carried in a skin case slung over the shoulder. It is\r\ndrawn with the two forefingers--not with the forefinger and thumb,\r\nas in the East--and generally the third or ring-finger is extended\r\nalong the string to give additional purchase. Savage tribes do little\r\nin the way of handicraft, but that little they do patiently, slowly,\r\nand therefore well. The bow and arrow are admirably adapted to their\r\npurpose. The latter is either a reed or a bit of arrow-wood (_Viburnum\r\ndentatum_), whose long, straight, and tough stems are used by the\r\nfletcher from the Mississippi to the Pacific. The piles are triangles\r\nof iron, agate, flint, chalcedony, opal, or other hard stone: for war\r\npurposes they are barbed, and bird-bolts tipped with hard wood are used\r\nfor killing small game. Some tribes poison their shafts: the material\r\nis the juice of a buffalo’s or an antelope’s liver when it has become\r\ngreen and decomposed after the bite of a rattlesnake; at least this\r\nis the account which all the hunters and mountaineers give of it.\r\nThey have also, I believe, vegetable poisons. The feathers are three\r\nin number; those preferred are the hawk’s and the raven’s; and some\r\ntribes glue, while others whip them on with tendon-thread. The stele is\r\ninvariably indented from the feathers to the tip with a shallow spiral\r\nfurrow: this vermiculation is intended, according to the traders, to\r\nhasten death by letting air into or letting blood out of the wound. It\r\nis probably the remnant of some superstition now obsolete, for every\r\nman does it, while no man explains why or wherefore. If the Indian\r\nworks well, he does not work quickly; he will expend upon half a dozen\r\narrows as many months. Each tribe has its own mark; the Pawnees, for\r\ninstance, make a bulge below the notch. Individuals also have private\r\nsigns which enable them to claim a disputed scalp or buffalo robe. In\r\nbattle or chase the arrows are held in the left hand, and are served\r\nout to the right with such rapidity that one long string of them seems\r\nto be cleaving the air. A good Sioux archer will, it is said, discharge\r\nnine arrows upward before the first has fallen to the ground. He will\r\ntransfix a bison and find his shaft upon the earth on the other side;\r\nand he shows his dexterity by discharging the arrow up to its middle\r\nin the quarry and by withdrawing it before the animal falls. Tales are\r\ntold of a single warrior killing several soldiers; and as a rule, at\r\nshort distances, the bow is considered by the whites a more effectual\r\nweapon than the gun. It is related that when the Sioux first felt the\r\neffects of Colt’s revolver, the weapon, after two shots, happened to\r\nslip from the owner’s grasp; when he recovered it and fired a third\r\ntime all fled, declaring that a white was shooting them with buffalo\r\nchips. Wonderful tales are told of the Indians’ accuracy with the\r\nbow: they hold it no great feat to put the arrow into a keyhole at\r\nthe distance of forty paces. It is true that I never saw any thing\r\nsurprising in their performances, but the savage will not take the\r\ntrouble to waste his skill without an object.\r\n\r\n  [77] An antiquated sort of German rifle, formerly used by the federal\r\n  troops.\r\n\r\n[THE SIOUX LANGUAGE.]\r\n\r\nThe Sioux tongue, like the Pawnee, is easily learned; government\r\nofficials and settlers acquire it as the Anglo-Indian does Hindostanee.\r\nThey are assisted by the excellent grammar and dictionary of the\r\nDakotah language, collated by the members of the Dakotah Mission,\r\nedited by the Rev. S. R. Riggs, M.A., and accepted for publication by\r\nthe Smithsonian Institution, December, 1851. The Dakotah-English part\r\ncontains about 16,000 words, and the bibliography (spelling-books,\r\ntracts, and translations) numbered ten years ago eighteen small\r\nvolumes. The work is compiled in a scholar-like manner. The\r\northography, though rather complicated, is intelligible, and is a\r\ngreat improvement upon the old and unartistic way of writing the\r\npolysynthetic Indian tongues, syllable by syllable, as though they were\r\nmonosyllabic Chinese; the superfluous _h_ (as Dakota_h_ for Dakota), by\r\nwhich the broad sound of the terminal _a_ is denoted, has been justly\r\ncast out. The peculiar letters _ch_, _p_, and _t_, are denoted by a dot\r\nbeneath the simple sound; similarly the _k_ (or Arabic _kaf_), the _gh_\r\n(the Semitic _ghain_) and the _kh_ (_khá_), which, as has happened in\r\nFranco-Arabic grammars, was usually expressed by an _R_. An apostrophe\r\n(_s’a_) denotes the hiatus, which is similar to the Arab’s hamzah.\r\n\r\nVater long ago remarked that the only languages which had a character,\r\nif not similar, at any rate analogous to the American, are the\r\nBasque and the Congo, that is, the South African or Kaffir family.\r\nThis is the case in many points: in Dakotah, for instance, as in\r\nKisawahili, almost every word ends in a pure or a nasalized vowel.\r\nBut the striking novelty of the African tongues, the inflexion of\r\nwords by an initial, not, as with us, by a terminal change and the\r\ncomplex system of euphony, does not appear in the American, which in\r\nits turn possesses a dual unknown to the African. The Dakotah, like\r\nthe Kaffir, has no gender; it uses the personal and impersonal, which\r\nis an older distinction in language. It follows the primitive and\r\nnatural arrangement of speech: it says, for instance, “aguyapi maku\r\nye,” bread to me give; as in Hindostanee, to quote no other, “roti\r\nhamko do.” So in logical argument it begins with the conclusion and\r\nproceeds to the premisses, which renders it difficult for a European\r\nto think in Dakotah. Like other American tongues, it is polysynthetic,\r\nwhich appears to be the effect of arrested development. Human speech\r\nbegins with inorganic sounds, which represent symbolism by means of\r\narrows pointed in a certain direction, bent trees, crossed rods, and\r\nother similar contrivances. Its first step is monosyllabic, which\r\ncorresponds with the pictograph, the earliest attempt at writing among\r\nthe uncivilized.[78] The next advance is polysynthesis, which is\r\napparently built upon monosyllabism, as the idiograph of the Chinese\r\nupon a picture or glyph. The last step is the syllabic and inflected,\r\ncorresponding with the Phœnico-Arabian alphabet, which gave rise to\r\nthe Greek, the Latin, and their descendants. The complexity of Dakotah\r\ngrammar is another illustration of the phenomenon that man in most\r\nthings, in language especially, begins with the most difficult and\r\nworks on toward the facile. Savages, who have no mental exercise but\r\nthe cultivation of speech, and semi-barbarous people, who still retain\r\nthe habit, employ complicated and highly elaborate tongues, _e. g._,\r\nArabic, Sanscrit, Latin, Greek, Kaffir, and Anglo-Saxon. With time\r\nthese become more simple; the _modus operandi_ appears to be admixture\r\nof race.\r\n\r\n  [78] A Kaffir girl wishing to give a hint to a friend of mine drew a\r\n  setting sun, a tree, and two figures standing under it; intelligible\r\n  enough, yet the Kaffirs ignore a syllabarium.\r\n\r\nThe Dakotahs have a sacred language, used by medicine-men, and rendered\r\nunintelligible to the vulgar by words borrowed from other Indian\r\ndialects, and by synonyms, _e. g._, biped for man, quadruped for\r\nwolf. A chief, asking for an ox or cow, calls it a dog, and a horse,\r\nmoccasins: possibly, like Orientals, he superstitiously avoids direct\r\nmention, and speaks of the object wanted by a humbler name. Poetry is\r\nhardly required in a language so highly figurative: a hi-hi-hi-hi-hi,\r\noccasionally interrupted by a few words, composes their songs. The Rev.\r\nMr. Pond gives the following specimen of “Blackboy’s” Mourning Song for\r\nhis Grandson, addressed to those of Ghostland:\r\n\r\n    Friend, pause, and look this way;\r\n    Friend, pause, and look this way;\r\n    Friend, pause, and look this way;\r\n                        Say ye,\r\n    A Grandson of Blackboy is coming.\r\n\r\nTheir speech is sometimes metaphorical to an extent which conveys an\r\nopposite meaning: “Friend, thou art a fool; thou hast let the Ojibwa\r\nstrike thee,” is the highest form of eulogy to a brave who has killed\r\nand scalped a foe; possibly a Malocchio-like fear, the dread of praise,\r\nwhich, according to Pliny, kills in India, underlies the habit.\r\n\r\nThe funerals differ in every tribe; the Sioux expose their dead,\r\nwrapped in blankets or buffalo robes, upon tall poles--a custom that\r\nreminds us of the Parsee’s “Tower of Silence.” The Yutas make their\r\ngraves high up the kanyons, usually in clefts of rock. Some bury the\r\ndead at full length; others sitting or doubled up; others on horseback,\r\nwith a barrow or tumulus of earth heaped up over their remains. The\r\nabsence of grave-yards in an Indian country is as remarkable as in the\r\nAfrican interior; thinness of population and the savage’s instinctive\r\ndislike to any _memento mori_ are the causes. After deaths the\r\n“keening” is long, loud, and lasting: the women, and often the men, cut\r\ntheir hair close, not allowing it to fall below the shoulders, and not\r\nunfrequently gash themselves, and amputate one or more fingers. The\r\ndead man, especiallly a chief, is in almost all tribes provided with a\r\nviaticum, dead or alive, of squaws and boys--generally those taken from\r\nanother tribe--horses and dogs; his lodge is burned, his arms, cooking\r\nutensils, saddles, and other accoutrements are buried with him, and a\r\ngoodly store of buffalo meat or other provision is placed by his side,\r\nthat his ghost may want nothing which it enjoyed in the flesh. Like all\r\nsavages, the Indian is unable to separate the idea of man’s immaterial\r\nspirit from man’s material wants: an impalpable and invisible form of\r\nmatter--called “spirit” because it is not cognizable to the senses,\r\nwhich are the only avenues of all knowledge--is as unintelligible\r\nto them as to a Latter-Day Saint, or, indeed, as to the mind of man\r\ngenerally. Hence the Indian’s smoking and offerings over the graves of\r\nfriends. Some tribes mourn on the same day of each moon till grief is\r\nsatisfied; others for a week after the death.\r\n\r\n[THE INDIAN PANTOMIME.]\r\n\r\nA remarkable characteristic of the Prairie Indian is his habit of\r\nspeaking, like the deaf and dumb, with his fingers. The pantomime is a\r\nsystem of signs, some conventional, others instinctive or imitative,\r\nwhich enables tribes who have no acquaintance with each other’s\r\ncustoms and tongues to hold limited but sufficient communication.\r\nAn interpreter who knows all the signs, which, however, are so\r\nnumerous and complicated that to acquire them is the labor of years,\r\nis preferred by the whites even to a good speaker. Some writers, as\r\nCaptain H. Stansbury, consider the system purely arbitrary; others,\r\nCaptain Marcy, for instance, hold it to be a natural language similar\r\nto the gestures which surd-mutes use spontaneously. Both views are\r\ntrue, but not wholly true; as the following pages will, I believe,\r\nprove, the pantomimic vocabulary is neither quite conventional nor the\r\nreverse.\r\n\r\nThe sign-system doubtless arose from the necessity of a communicating\r\nmedium between races speaking many different dialects, and debarred\r\nby circumstances from social intercourse. Its area is extensive: it\r\nprevails among many of the Prairie tribes, as the Hapsaroke, or Crows,\r\nthe Dakotah, the Cheyenne, and the Shoshonee; the Pawnees, Yutas, and\r\nShoshoko, or Diggers, being vagrants and outcasts, have lost or never\r\nhad the habit. Those natives who, like the Arapahoes, possess a very\r\nscanty vocabulary, pronounced in a quasi-unintelligible way, can hardly\r\nconverse with one another in the dark: to make a stranger understand\r\nthem they must always repair to the camp fire for “powwow.” A story is\r\ntold of a man who, being sent among the Cheyennes to qualify himself\r\nfor interpreting, returned in a week, and proved his competence: all\r\nthat he did, however, was to go through the usual pantomime with a\r\nrunning accompaniment of grunts. I have attempted to describe a few\r\nof the simpler signs: the reader, however, will readily perceive that\r\nwithout diagrams the explanation is very imperfect, and that in half an\r\nhour, with an Indian or an interpreter, he would learn more than by a\r\nhundred pages of print.\r\n\r\nThe first lesson is to distinguish the signs of the different tribes,\r\nand it will be observed that the French voyageurs and traders have\r\noften named the Indian nations from their totemic or masonic gestures.\r\n\r\nThe Pawnees (Les Loups) imitate a wolf’s ears with the two\r\nforefingers--the right hand is always understood unless otherwise\r\nspecified[79]--extended together, upright, on the left side of the head.\r\n\r\n  [79] The left, as a rule, denotes inversion or contradiction.\r\n\r\nThe Arapahoes, or Dirty Noses, rub the right side of that organ with\r\nthe forefinger: some call this bad tribe the Smellers, and make their\r\nsign to consist of seizing the nose with the thumb and forefinger.\r\n\r\nThe Comanches (Les Serpents) imitate, by the waving of the hand or\r\nforefinger, the forward crawling motion of a snake.\r\n\r\nThe Cheyennes, Paikanavos, or Cut-Wrists, draw the lower edge of the\r\nhand across the left arm as if gashing it with a knife.\r\n\r\nThe Sioux (Les Coupe-gorges), by drawing the lower edge of the hand\r\nacross the throat: it is a gesture not unknown to us, but forms a truly\r\nominous salutation considering those by whom it is practiced; hence the\r\nSioux are called by the Yutas Pámpe Chyimina, or Hand-cutters.\r\n\r\nThe Hapsaroke (Les Corbeaux), by imitating the flapping of the birds’\r\nwings with the two hands--palms downward--brought close to the\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nThe Kiowas, or Prairie-men, make the signs of the prairie and of\r\ndrinking water. These will presently be described.\r\n\r\nThe Yutas, “they who live on mountains,” have a complicated sign which\r\ndenotes “living in mountains;” these will be explained under “sit” and\r\n“mountains.”\r\n\r\nThe Blackfeet, called by the Yutas Paike or Goers, pass the right hand,\r\nbent spoon-fashion, from the heel to the little toe of the right foot.\r\n\r\nThe following are a few preliminaries indispensable to the prairie\r\ntraveler:\r\n\r\n  _Halt!_--Raise the hand, with the palm in front, and push it backward\r\n  and forward several times--a gesture well known in the East.\r\n\r\n  _I don’t know you!_--Move the raised hand, with the palm in front,\r\n  slowly to the right and left.\r\n\r\n  _I am angry!_--Close the fist, place it against the forehead, and\r\n  turn it to and fro in that position.\r\n\r\n  _Are you friendly?_--Raise both hands, grasped, as if in the act of\r\n  shaking hands, or lock the two forefingers together while the hands\r\n  are raised.\r\n\r\nThese signs will be found useful upon the prairie in case of meeting a\r\nsuspected band. The Indians, like the Bedouin and N. African Moslem,\r\ndo honor to strangers and guests by putting their horses to speed,\r\ncouching their lances, and other peculiarities which would readily be\r\ndispensed with by gentlemen of peaceful pursuits and shaky nerves. If\r\nfriendly, the band will halt when the hint is given and return the\r\nsalute; if surly, they will disregard the command to stop, and probably\r\nwill make the sign of anger. Then--ware scalp!\r\n\r\n  _Come!_--Beckon with the forefinger, as in Europe, not as is done in\r\n  the East.\r\n\r\n  _Come back!_--Beckon in the European way, and draw the forefinger\r\n  toward yourself.\r\n\r\n  _Go!_--Move both hands edgeways (the palms fronting the breast)\r\n  toward the left with a rocking-horse motion.\r\n\r\n  _Sit!_--Make a motion toward the ground, as if to pound it with the\r\n  ferient of the closed hand.\r\n\r\n  _Lie down!_--Point to the ground, and make a motion as if of lying\r\n  down.\r\n\r\n  _Sleep!_--Ditto, closing the eyes.\r\n\r\n  _Look!_--Touch the right eye with the index and point it outward.\r\n\r\n  _Hear!_--Tap the right ear with the index tip.\r\n\r\nColors are expressed by a comparison with some object in sight. Many\r\nthings, as the blowing of wind, the cries of beasts and birds, and the\r\nroaring of the sea, are imitated by sound.\r\n\r\n  _See!_--Strike out the two forefingers forward from the eyes.\r\n\r\n  _Smell!_--Touch the nose-tip. A bad smell is expressed by the same\r\n  sign, ejaculating at the same time “Pooh!” and making the sign of bad.\r\n\r\n  _Taste!_--Touch the tongue-tip.\r\n\r\n  _Eat!_--Imitate the action of conveying food with the fingers to the\r\n  mouth.\r\n\r\n  _Drink!_--Scoop up with the hand imaginary water into the mouth.\r\n\r\n  _Smoke!_--With the crooked index describe a pipe in the air,\r\n  beginning at the lips; then wave the open hand from the mouth to\r\n  imitate curls of smoke.\r\n\r\n  _Speak!_--Extend the open hand from the chin.\r\n\r\n  _Fight!_--Make a motion with both fists to and fro, like a pugilist\r\n  of the eighteenth century who preferred a high guard.\r\n\r\n  _Kill!_--Smite the sinister palm earthward with the dexter fist\r\n  sharply, in sign of “going down;” or strike out with the dexter fist\r\n  toward the ground, meaning to “shut down;” or pass the dexter index\r\n  under the left forefinger, meaning to “go under.”\r\n\r\nTo show that fighting is actually taking place, make the gestures as\r\nabove described; tap the lips with the palm like an Oriental woman when\r\n“keening,” screaming the while O-a! O-a! to imitate the war-song.\r\n\r\n  _Wash!_--Rub the hand as with invisible soap in imperceptible water.\r\n\r\n  _Think!_--Pass the forefinger sharply across the breast from right to\r\n  left.\r\n\r\n  _Hide!_--Place the hand inside the clothing of the left breast. This\r\n  means also to put away or to keep secret. To express “I won’t say,”\r\n  make the signs of “I” and “no” (which see), and hide the hand as\r\n  above directed.\r\n\r\n  _Love!_--Fold the hands crosswise over the breast, as if embracing\r\n  the object, assuming at the same time a look expressing the desire\r\n  to carry out the operation. This gesture will be understood by the\r\n  dullest squaw.\r\n\r\n  _Tell truth!_--Extend the forefinger from the mouth (“one word”).\r\n\r\n  _Tell lie!_--Extend the two first fingers from the mouth (“double\r\n  tongue,” a significant gesture).\r\n\r\n  _Steal!_--Seize an imaginary object with the right hand from under\r\n  the left fist. To express horse-stealing they saw with the right\r\n  hand down upon the extended fingers of the left, thereby denoting\r\n  rope-cutting.\r\n\r\n  _Trade or exchange!_--Cross the forefingers of both hands before the\r\n  breast--“diamond cut diamond.”\r\n\r\nThis sign also denotes the Americans, and, indeed, any white men, who\r\nare generically called by the Indians west of the Rocky Mountains\r\n“Shwop,” from our swap or swop, an English Romany word for barter or\r\nexchange.\r\n\r\nThe pronouns are expressed by pointing to the person designated. For\r\n“I,” touch the nose-tip, or otherwise indicate self with the index. The\r\nsecond and third persons are similarly made known.\r\n\r\nEvery animal has its precise sign, and the choice of gesture is\r\nsometimes very ingenious. If the symbol be not known, the form may\r\nbe drawn on the ground, and the strong perceptive faculties of the\r\nsavage enable him easily to recognize even rough draughts. A cow or a\r\nsheep denotes white men, as if they were their totems. The Indian’s\r\nhigh development of locality also enables him to map the features of\r\na country readily and correctly upon the sand. Moreover, almost every\r\ngrand feature has a highly significant name, Flintwater, for instance,\r\nand nothing is easier than to combine the signs.\r\n\r\nThe _bear_ is expressed by passing the hand before the face to mean\r\nugliness, at the same time grinning and extending the fingers like\r\nclaws.\r\n\r\nThe _buffalo_ is known by raising the forefingers crooked inward, in\r\nthe semblance of horns on both sides of the head.\r\n\r\nThe _elk_ is signified by simultaneously raising both hands with the\r\nfingers extended on both sides of the head to imitate palmated horns.\r\n\r\nFor the _deer_, extend the thumbs and the two forefingers of each hand\r\non each side of the head.\r\n\r\nFor the _antelope_, extend the thumbs and forefingers along the sides\r\nof the head, to simulate ears and horns.\r\n\r\n_Mountain sheep_ are denoted by placing the hands on a level with the\r\nears, the palms facing backward and the fingers slightly reversed, to\r\nimitate the ammonite-shaped horns.\r\n\r\nFor the _beaver_, describe a parenthesis, _e. g._ ( ), with the thumb\r\nand index of both hands, and then with the dexter index imitate the\r\nwagging of the tail.\r\n\r\nThe _dog_ is shown by drawing the two forefingers slightly opened\r\nhorizontally across the breast from right to left. This is a highly,\r\nappropriate and traditional gesture: before the introduction of horses,\r\nthe dog was taught to carry the tent poles, and the motion expressed\r\nthe lodge trail.\r\n\r\nTo denote the _mule_ or _ass_, the long ears are imitated by the\r\nindices on both sides and above the head.\r\n\r\nFor the _crow_, and, indeed, any bird, the hands are flapped near\r\nthe shoulders. If specification be required, the cry is imitated or\r\nsome peculiarity is introduced. The following will show the ingenuity\r\nwith which the Indian can convey his meaning under difficulties. A\r\nYuta wishing to explain that the torpedo or gymnotus eel is found in\r\nCotton-wood Kanyon Lake, took to it thus: he made the body by extending\r\nhis sinister index to the fore, touched it with the dexter index at two\r\npoints on both sides to show legs, and finally sharply withdrew his\r\nright forefinger to convey the idea of an electric shock.\r\n\r\nSome of the symbols of relationship are highly appropriate, and not\r\nungraceful or unpicturesque. Man is denoted by a sign which will not\r\nadmit of description; woman, by passing the hand down both sides of\r\nthe head as if smoothing or stroking the long hair. A son or daughter\r\nis expressed by making with the hand a movement denoting issue from\r\nthe loins: if the child be small, a bit of the index held between the\r\nantagonized thumb and medius is shown. The same sign of issue expresses\r\nboth parents, with additional explanations: To say, for instance,\r\n“_my mother_,” you would first pantomime “_I_,” or, which is the same\r\nthing, “_my_;” then “_woman_;” and, finally, the symbol of parentage.\r\n“_My grandmother_” would be conveyed in the same way, adding to the\r\nend clasped hands, closed eyes, and like an old woman’s bent back. The\r\nsign for brother and sister is perhaps the prettiest: the two first\r\nfinger-tips are put into the mouth, denoting that they fed from the\r\nsame breast. For the wife--squaw is now becoming a word of reproach\r\namong the Indians--the dexter forefinger is passed between the extended\r\nthumb and index of the left.\r\n\r\nOf course there is a sign for every weapon. The _knife_--scalp or\r\nother--is shown by cutting the sinister palm with the dexter ferient\r\ndownward and toward one’s self: if the cuts be made upward with the\r\npalm downward, meat is understood. The _tomahawk_, hatchet, or axe is\r\ndenoted by chopping the left hand with the right; the _sword_ by the\r\nmotion of drawing it; the _bow_ by the movement of bending it; and a\r\n_spear_ or _lance_ by an imitation of darting it. For the _gun_, the\r\ndexter thumb and fingers are flashed or scattered, _i. e._, thrown\r\noutward or upward to denote fire. The same movement made lower down\r\nexpresses a _pistol_. The _arrow_ is expressed by nocking it upon\r\nan imaginary bow, and by “snapping” with the index and medius. The\r\n_shield_ is shown by pointing with the index over the left shoulder,\r\nwhere it is slung ready to be brought over the breast when required.\r\n\r\nThe following are the most useful words:\r\n\r\n  _Yes._--Wave the hands straight forward from the face.\r\n\r\n  _No._--Wave the hand from right to left, as if motioning away. This\r\n  sign also means “I’ll have nothing to do with you.” Done slowly and\r\n  insinuatingly, it informs a woman that she is _charmante_--“not to be\r\n  touched” being the idea.\r\n\r\n  _Good._--Wave the hand from the mouth, extending the thumb from the\r\n  index and closing the other three fingers. This sign means also “I\r\n  know.” “I don’t know” is expressed by waving the right hand with the\r\n  palm outward before the right breast, or by moving about the two\r\n  forefingers before the breast, meaning “two hearts.”\r\n\r\n  _Bad._--Scatter the dexter fingers outward, as if spirting away water\r\n  from them.\r\n\r\n  _Now_ (_at once_).--Clap both palms together sharply and repeatedly,\r\n  or make the sign of “to-day.”\r\n\r\n  _Day._--Make a circle with the thumb and forefinger of both, in sign\r\n  of the sun. The _hour_ is pointed out by showing the luminary’s place\r\n  in the heavens. The _moon_ is expressed by a crescent with the thumb\r\n  and forefinger: this also denotes a month. For a _year_ give the sign\r\n  of rain or snow.\r\n\r\nMany Indians ignore the quadripartite division of the seasons,\r\nwhich seems to be an invention of European latitudes; the Persians,\r\nfor instance, know it, but the Hindoos do not. They have, however,\r\ndistinct terms for the month, all of which are pretty and descriptive,\r\nappropriate and poetical; _e. g._, the moon of light nights, the moon\r\nof leaves, the moon of strawberries, for April, May, and June. The\r\nOjibwa have a queer quaternal division, called Of sap, Of abundance, Of\r\nfading, and Of freezing. The Dakotah reckon five moons to winter and\r\nfive to summer, leaving one to spring and one to autumn; the year is\r\nlunar, and as the change of season is denoted by the appearance of sore\r\neyes and of raccoons, any irregularity throws the people out.\r\n\r\n  _Night._--Make a closing movement as if of the darkness by bringing\r\n  together both hands with the dorsa upward and the fingers to the\r\n  fore: the motion is from right to left, and at the end the two\r\n  indices are alongside and close to each other. This movement must be\r\n  accompanied by bending forward with bowed head, otherwise it may be\r\n  misunderstood for the freezing over of a lake or river.\r\n\r\n  _To-day._--Touch the nose with the index tip, and motion with the\r\n  fist toward the ground.\r\n\r\n  _Yesterday._--Make with the left hand the circle which the sun\r\n  describes from sunrise to sunset, or invert the direction from sunset\r\n  to sunrise with the right hand.\r\n\r\n  _To-morrow._--Describe the motion of the sun from east to west. Any\r\n  number of days may be counted upon the fingers. The latter, I need\r\n  hardly say, are the only numerals in the pantomimic vocabulary.\r\n\r\nAmong the Dakotahs, when they have gone over the fingers and thumbs\r\nof both hands, one is temporarily turned down for one ten; at the end\r\nof another ten a second finger is turned down, and so on, as among\r\nchildren who are learning to count. “Opawinge,” one hundred, is derived\r\nfrom “pawinga,” to go round in circles, as the fingers have all been\r\ngone over again for their respective tens; “kektopawinge” is from “ake”\r\nand “opawinge”--“hundred again”--being about to recommence the circle\r\nof their fingers already completed in hundreds. For numerals above a\r\nthousand there is no method of computing. There is a sign and word for\r\none half of a thing, but none to denote any smaller aliquot part.\r\n\r\n  _Peace._--Intertwine the fingers of both hands.\r\n\r\n  _Friendship._--Clasp the left with the right hand.\r\n\r\n  _Glad_ (_pleased_).--Wave the open hand outward from the breast, to\r\n  express “good heart.”\r\n\r\n  _A Cup._--Imitate its form with both hands, and make the sign of\r\n  drinking from it. In this way any utensil can be intelligibly\r\n  described--of course, provided that the interlocutor has seen it.\r\n\r\n  _Paint._--Daub both the cheeks downward with the index.\r\n\r\n  _Looking-glass._--Place both palms before the face, and admire your\r\n  countenance in them.\r\n\r\n  _Bead._--Point to a bead, or make the sign of a necklace.\r\n\r\n  _Wire._--Show it, or where it ought to be, in the ear-lobe.\r\n\r\n  _Whisky._--Make the sign of “bad” and “drink” for “bad water.”\r\n\r\n  _Blanket or Clothes._--Put them on in pantomime.\r\n\r\n  _A Lodge._--Place the fingers of both hands ridge-fashion before the\r\n  breast.\r\n\r\n  _Fire._--Blow it, and warm the hands before it. To express the\r\n  boiling of a kettle, the sign of fire is made low down, and an\r\n  imaginary pot is eaten from.\r\n\r\n  _It is cold._--Wrap up, shudder, and look disagreeable.\r\n\r\n  _Rain._--Scatter the fingers downward. The same sign denotes snow.\r\n\r\n  _Wind._--Stretch the fingers of both hands outward, puffing violently\r\n  the while.\r\n\r\n  _A Storm._--Make the rain sign; then, if thunder and lightning are to\r\n  be expressed, move, as if in anger, the body to and fro, to show the\r\n  wrath of the elements.\r\n\r\n  _A Stone._--If light, act as if picking it up; if heavy, as if\r\n  dropping it.\r\n\r\n  _A Hill._--Close the finger-tips over the head: if a mountain is to\r\n  be expressed, raise them high. To denote an ascent on rising ground,\r\n  pass the right palm over the left hand, half doubling up the latter,\r\n  so that it looks like a ridge.\r\n\r\n  _A Plain._--Wave both the palms outward and low down.\r\n\r\n  _A River._--Make the sign of drinking, and then wave both the palms\r\n  outward. A rivulet, creek, or stream is shown by the drinking sign,\r\n  and by holding the index tip between the thumb and medius; an arroyo\r\n  (dry water-course), by covering up the tip with the thumb and middle\r\n  finger.\r\n\r\n  _A Lake._--Make the sign of drinking, and form a basin with both\r\n  hands. If a large body of water is in question, wave both palms\r\n  outward as in denoting a plain. The Prairie savages have never seen\r\n  the sea, so it would be vain to attempt explanation.\r\n\r\n  _A Book._--Place the right palm on the left palm, and then open both\r\n  before the face.\r\n\r\n  _A Letter._--Write with the thumb and dexter index on the sinister\r\n  palm.\r\n\r\n  _A Wagon._--Roll hand over hand, imitating a wheel.\r\n\r\n  _A Wagon-road._--Make the wagon sign, and then wave the hand along\r\n  the ground.\r\n\r\n  _Grass._--Point to the ground with the index, and then turn the\r\n  fingers upward to denote growth. If the grass be long, raise the hand\r\n  high; and if yellow, point out that color.\r\n\r\nThe pantomime, as may be seen, is capable of expressing detailed\r\nnarratives. For instance, supposing an Indian would tell the following\r\ntale--“Early this morning I mounted my horse, rode off at a gallop,\r\ntraversed a kanyon or ravine, then over a mountain to a plain where\r\nthere was no water, sighted bison, followed them, killed three of them,\r\nskinned them, packed the flesh upon my pony, remounted, and returned\r\nhome”--he would symbolize it thus:\r\n\r\n  Touches nose--“_I_.”\r\n\r\n  Opens out the palms of his hand--“_this morning_.”\r\n\r\n  Points to east--“_early_.”\r\n\r\n  Places two dexter forefingers astraddle over sinister\r\n  index--“_mounted my horse_.”\r\n\r\n  Moves both hands upward and rocking-horse fashion toward the\r\n  left--“_galloped_.”\r\n\r\n  Passes the dexter hand right through thumb and forefinger of the\r\n  sinister, which are widely extended--“_traversed a kanyon_.”\r\n\r\n  Closes the finger-tips high over the head, and waves both palms\r\n  outward--“_over a mountain to a plain_.”\r\n\r\n  Scoops up with the hand imaginary water into the mouth, and then\r\n  waves the hand from the face to denote “no”--“_where there was no\r\n  water_.”\r\n\r\n  Touches eye--“_sighted_.”\r\n\r\n  Raises the forefingers crooked inward on both sides of the\r\n  head--“_bison_.”\r\n\r\n  Smites the sinister palm downward with the dexter fist--“_killed_.”\r\n\r\n  Shows three fingers--“_three of them_.”\r\n\r\n  Scrapes the left palm with the edge of the right hand--“_skinned\r\n  them_.”\r\n\r\n  Places the dexter on the sinister palm, and then the dexter palm on\r\n  the sinister dorsum--“_packed the flesh upon my pony_.”\r\n\r\n  Straddles the two forefingers on the index of the\r\n  left--“_remounted_;” and, finally,\r\n\r\n  Beckons toward self--“_returned home_.”\r\n\r\nTo conclude, I can hardly flatter myself that these descriptions have\r\nbeen made quite intelligible to the reader. They may, however, serve\r\nto prepare his mind for a _vivâ voce_ lesson upon the prairies, should\r\nfate have such thing in store for him.\r\n\r\nAfter this digression I return to my prosaic Diary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nConcluding the Route to the Great Salt Lake City.\r\n\r\n\r\n[SUNRISE.]\r\n\r\n  _Along the Black Hills to Box-Elder. 15th August._\r\n\r\nI arose “between two days,” a little before 4 A.M., and watched the\r\ndawn, and found in its beauties a soothing influence, which acted upon\r\nstiff limbs and discontented spirit as if it had been a spell.\r\n\r\nThe stars of the Great Bear--the prairie night-clock--first began\r\nto pale without any seeming cause, till presently a faint streak of\r\npale light--_dum i gurg_, or the wolf’s tail, as it is called by the\r\nPersian--began to shimmer upon the eastern verge of heaven. It grew\r\nand grew through the dark blue air: one unaccustomed to the study\r\nof the “gray-eyed morn” would have expected it to usher in the day,\r\nwhen, gradually as it had struggled into existence, it faded, and a\r\ndeeper darkness than before once more invaded the infinitude above.\r\nBut now the unrisen sun is more rapidly climbing the gloomy walls of\r\nKoh i Kaf--the mountain rim which encircles the world, and through\r\nwhose lower gap the false dawn had found its way--preceded by a warm\r\nflush of light, which chases the shades till, though loth to depart,\r\nthey find neither on earth nor in the firmament a place where they\r\ncan linger. Warmer and warmer waxes the heavenly radiance, gliding\r\nup to the keystone of the vault above; fainter and fainter grows\r\nthe darkness, till the last stain disappears behind the Black Hills\r\nto the west, and the stars one by one, like glow-worms, “pale their\r\nineffectual fires”--the “Pointers” are the longest to resist--retreat\r\nbackward, as it were, and fade away into endless space. Slowly, almost\r\nimperceptibly, the marvelous hues of “glorious morn,” here truly a\r\nfresh “birth of heaven and earth,” all gold and sapphire, acquire depth\r\nand distinctness, till at last a fiery flush ushers from beneath the\r\nhorizon the source of all these splendors,\r\n\r\n    “Robed in flames and amber light;”\r\n\r\nand another day, with its little life of joys and sorrows, of hopes and\r\nfears, is born to the world.\r\n\r\nThough we all rose up early, packed, and were ready to proceed, there\r\nwas an unusual _vis inertiæ_ on the part of the driver: Indians were\r\nabout; the mules, of course, had bolted; but that did not suffice as\r\nexplanation. Presently the “wonder leaked out:” our companions were\r\ntransferred from their comfortable vehicle to a real “shandridan,” a\r\nRocky-Mountain bone-setter. They were civil enough to the exceedingly\r\ndrunken youth--a runaway New Yorker--who did us the honor of driving\r\nus; for _quand on a besoin du diable on lui dit, “Monsieur.”_ One\r\ncan not expect, however, the _diable_ to be equally civil: when we\r\nasked him to tidy our vehicle a little, he simply replied that he’d\r\nbe darned if he did. Long may be the darning-needle and sharp to him!\r\nBut tempers seriously soured must blow up or burst, and a very pretty\r\nlittle quarrel was the result: it was settled bloodlessly, because one\r\ngentleman, who, to do him justice, showed every disposition to convert\r\nhimself into a target, displayed such perfect unacquaintance with the\r\nweapons--revolvers--usually used on similar occasions, that it would\r\nhave been mere murder to have taken pistol in hand against him.\r\n\r\nAs we sat very disconsolate in the open veranda, five Indians stalked\r\nin, and the biggest and burliest of the party, a middle-aged man, with\r\nthe long, straight Indian hair, high, harsh features, and face bald\r\nof eyebrows and beard, after offering his paw to Mrs. Dana and the\r\nrest of the party, sat down with a manner of natural dignity somewhat\r\ntrenching upon the impertinent. Presently, diving his hand into his\r\nbreast, the old rat pulled out a thick fold of leather, and, after much\r\nmanipulation, disclosed a dirty brown, ragged-edged sheet of paper,\r\ncertifying him to be “Little Thunder,” and signed by “General Harney.”\r\nThis, then, was the chief who showed the white feather at Ash Hollow,\r\nand of whom some military poet sang:\r\n\r\n        “We didn’t make a blunder,\r\n        We rubbed out Little Thunder,\r\n    And we sent him to the other side of Jordan.”\r\n\r\nLittle Thunder did not look quite rubbed out; but for poesy fiction\r\nis, of course, an element far more appropriate than fact. I remember a\r\nsimilar effusion of the Anglo-Indian muse, which consigned “Akbar Khan\r\nthe Yaghi” to the tune and fate of the King of the Cannibal Isles, with\r\na contempt of actualities quite as refreshing. The Western Indians are\r\nas fond of these testimonials as the East Indians: they preserve them\r\nwith care as guarantees of their good conduct, and sometimes, as may\r\nbe expected, carry about certificates in the style of Bellerophons’\r\nletters. Little Thunder was _en route_ to Fort Laramie, where he\r\nintended to lay a complaint against the Indian agent, who embezzled, he\r\nsaid, half the rations and presents intended for his tribe. Even the\r\nwhites owned that the “Maje’s” bear got more sugar than all the Indians\r\nput together.\r\n\r\n[THE INDIAN DEPARTMENT.]\r\n\r\nNothing can be worse, if the _vox populi occidentalis_ be taken as\r\nthe _vox Dei_, than the modern management of the Indian Bureau at\r\nWashington. In former times the agencies were in the hands of the\r\nmilitary authorities, and the officer commanding the department\r\nwas responsible for malversation of office. This was found to work\r\nwell; the papers signed were signed on honor. But in the United\r\nStates, the federal army, though well paid, is never allowed to keep\r\nany appointment that can safely be taken away from it. The Indian\r\nDepartment is now divided into six superintendencies, viz., Northern,\r\nCentral, Southern, Utah, New Mexico, Washington and Oregon Territories,\r\nwho report to the Indian Office or Bureau of the Commissioners of\r\nIndian Affairs at Washington, under the charge of the Department of the\r\nInterior. The bond varies from $50,000 to $75,000, and the salary from\r\n$2000 to $2500 per annum. The northern superintendency contains four\r\nagencies, the central fourteen, the southern five, the Utah three, New\r\nMexico six, and the miscellaneous, including Washington, eight. The\r\ngrand total of agents, including two specials for Indians in Texas,\r\nis forty-two. Their bond is between $5000 and $75,000, and the salary\r\nbetween $1000 and $1550. There are also various sub-agencies, with\r\npay of $1000 each, and giving in bonds $2000. There ought to be no\r\nperquisites; an unscrupulous man, however, finds many opportunities\r\nof making free with the presents; and the reflection that his office\r\ntenure shall expire after the fourth year must make him but the more\r\nreckless. As fifty or sixty appointments = 50 or 60 votes, × 20 in\r\nPresident electioneering, fitness for the task often becomes quite\r\na subordinate consideration; the result is, necessarily, peculation\r\nproducing discontent among the Indians, and the finale, death to the\r\nwhites. To become a good Indian agent, a man requires the variety of\r\nqualifications which would fit him for the guardianship of children,\r\nexperience and ability, benevolence and philanthropy: it would be\r\ndifficult to secure such phœnix for $200 per annum, and it is found\r\neasier not to look for it. The remedy of these evils is not far from\r\nthe surface--the restoration of the office into the hands of the\r\nresponsible military servant of the state, who would keep it _quamdiu\r\nse benè gesserit_, and become better capable of serving his masters,\r\nthe American people, by the importance which the office would give him\r\nin the eyes of his _protégés_. This is the system of the French Bureau\r\nArabe, which, with its faults, I love still. But the political mind\r\nwould doubtless determine the cure to be worse than the disease. After\r\nventing his grievances, Little Thunder arose, and, accompanied by his\r\nbraves, remounted and rode off toward the east.\r\n\r\nWhile delayed by the mules and their masters, we may amuse ourselves\r\nand divert our thoughts from the battle, and, perhaps, murder and\r\nsudden death, which may happen this evening, by studying the geography\r\nof the Black Hills. The range forms nearly a right angle, the larger\r\nlimb--ninety miles--running east to west with a little southing along\r\nthe Platte, the shorter leg--sixty miles--trending from north to south\r\nwith a few degrees of easting and westing. Forming the easternmost\r\npart of the great trans-Mississippian mountain region, in the 44th\r\nparallel and between the 103d and 105th meridians, these masses cover\r\nan area of 6000 square miles. They are supposed to have received their\r\nlast violent upheaval at the close of the cretaceous period; their\r\nbases are elevated from 2500 to 3500 feet--the highest peaks attaining\r\n6700 feet--above river level, while their eastern is from 2000 to 3000\r\nfeet below the western foundation. Their materials, as determined\r\nby Lieutenant Warren’s exploration, are successively metamorphosed\r\nazoic rock, including granite, lower Silurian (Potsdam sandstone),\r\nDevonian (?), carboniferous, Permian, Jurassic, and cretaceous. Like\r\nIda, they are abundant in springs and flowing streams, which shed\r\nmainly to the northeast and the southeast, supplying the Indians with\r\ntrout and salmon trout, catfish (_Prinelodus_), and pickerel. They\r\nabound in small rich valleys, well grown with grass, and wild fruits,\r\nchoke-cherries (_P. Virginiana_), currants, sand-buttes fruit (_C.\r\npumila?_), and buffalo berries (_Shepherdia argentea_, or grains de\r\nbœuf). When irrigated, the bottoms are capable of high cultivation.\r\nThey excel in fine timber for fuel and lumber, covering an area of\r\n1500 square miles; in carboniferous rock of the true coal measures;\r\nand in other good building material. As in most of the hill ranges\r\nwhich are offsets from the Rocky Mountains, they contain gold in\r\nvaluable quantities, and doubtless a minute examination will lead\r\nto the discovery of many other useful minerals. The Black Hills are\r\nappropriately named: a cloak of gloomy forest, pine and juniper,\r\napparently springing from a rock denuded of less hardy vegetation,\r\nseems to invest them from head to foot. The Laramie Hills are\r\nsub-ranges of the higher ridge, and the well-known peak, the Pharos of\r\nthe prairie mariner, rises about 1° due west of Fort Laramie to the\r\nheight of 6500 feet above sea level. Beyond the meridian of Laramie\r\nthe country totally changes. The broad prairie lands, unencumbered by\r\ntimber, and covered with a rich pasturage, which highly adapts them\r\nfor grazing, are now left behind. We are about to enter a dry, sandy,\r\nand sterile waste of sage, and presently of salt, where rare spots are\r\nfitted for rearing stock, and this formation will continue till we\r\nreach the shadow of the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\n[LA BONTÉ.]\r\n\r\nAt length, the mules coming about 10 45 A.M., we hitched up, and,\r\nnothing loth, bade adieu to Horseshoe Creek and the “ladies.” The\r\ndriver sentimentally informed us that we were to see no more specimens\r\nof ladyhood for many days--gladdest tidings to one of the party, at\r\nleast. The road, which ran out of sight of the river, was broken and\r\njagged; a little labor would have made it tolerable, but what could the\r\ngood pastor of Oberlin do with a folk whose only thought in life is\r\ndram-drinking, tobacco-chewing, trading, and swapping?[80] The country\r\nwas cut with creeks and arroyos, which separated the several bulges of\r\nground, and the earth’s surface was of a dull brick-dust red, thinly\r\nscrubbed over with coarse grass, ragged sage, and shrublets fit only\r\nfor the fire. After a desolate drive, we sighted below us the creek\r\nLa Bonté--so called from a French _voyageur_--green and bisected by a\r\nclear mountain stream whose banks were thick with self-planted trees.\r\nIn the labyrinth of paths we chose the wrong one: presently we came\r\nto a sheer descent of four or five feet, and after deliberation as to\r\nwhether the vehicle would “take it” or not, we came to the conclusion\r\nthat we had better turn the restive mules to the right-about. Then,\r\ncheered by the sight of our consort, the other wagon, which stood\r\ntemptingly shaded by the grove of cotton-wood, willows, box elder\r\n(_Negundo aceroides_), and wild cherry, at the distance of about half\r\na mile, we sought manfully the right track, and the way in which the\r\ndriver charged the minor obstacles was “a caution to mules.” We ought\r\nto have arrived at 2 45 P.M.; we were about an hour later. The station\r\nhad yet to be built; the whole road was in a transition state at the\r\ntime of our travel; there was, however, a new corral for “forting”\r\nagainst Indians, and a kind of leafy arbor, which the officials had\r\nconverted into a “cottage near a wood.”\r\n\r\n  [80] The civilized Anglo-Americans are far more severe upon their\r\n  half-barbarous brethren than any stranger; to witness, the following:\r\n\r\n  A Hoosier (native of Indiana) was called upon the stand, away out\r\n  West, to testify to the character of a brother Hoosier. It was as\r\n  follows:\r\n\r\n  “How long have you known Bill Bushwhack?”\r\n\r\n  “Ever since he war born.”\r\n\r\n  “What is his general character?”\r\n\r\n  “Letter A, No. 1--’bove par a very great way.”\r\n\r\n  “Would you believe him on oath?”\r\n\r\n  “Yes, Sir-ee, on or off, or any other way.”\r\n\r\n  “What is your opinion on his qualifications to good conduct?”\r\n\r\n  “He’s the best shot on the prairies or in the woods; he can shave the\r\n  eye-bristles off a wolf as far as a shootin’-iron’ll carry a ball;\r\n  he can drink a quart of grog any day, and he chaws tobacker like a\r\n  horse.”\r\n\r\n  So Bill Bushwhack passed muster.--_N. Y. Spirit of the Times._\r\n\r\n[THE RED REGION.]\r\n\r\nA little after 4 P.M. we forded the creek painfully with our new\r\ncattle--three rats and a slug. The latter was pronounced by our driver,\r\nwhen he condescended to use other language than anathemata, “the\r\nmeanest cuss he ever seed.” We were careful, however, to supply him at\r\nthe shortest intervals with whisky-drams, which stimulated him, after\r\nbreaking his whip, to perform a tattoo with clods and stones, kicks and\r\nstamps, upon the recreant animals’ haunches, and by virtue of these\r\nwe accomplished our twenty-five miles in tolerable time. For want of\r\nother pleasantries to contemplate, we busied ourselves in admiring\r\nthe regularity and accuracy with which our consort wagon secured for\r\nherself all the best teams. The land was a red waste, such as travelers\r\nfind in Eastern Africa, which after rains sheds streams like blood.\r\nThe soil was a decomposition of ferruginous rock, here broken with\r\nrugged hills, precipices of ruddy sandstone 200 feet high, shaded or\r\ndotted with black-green cedars, there cumbered by huge boulders; the\r\nravine-like water-courses which cut the road showed that after heavy\r\nrains a net-work of torrents must add to the pleasures of traveling,\r\nand the vegetation was reduced to the dull green artemisia, the azalia,\r\nand the jaundiced potentilla. After six miles we saw on the left of\r\nthe path a huge natural pile or burrow of primitive boulders, about 200\r\nfeet high, and called “Brigham’s Peak,” because, according to Jehu’s\r\nwhiskyfied story, the prophet, revelator, and seer of the Latter-Day\r\nSaints had there, in 1857 (!), pronounced a 4th of July oration in the\r\npresence of 200 or 300 fair devotees.\r\n\r\nPresently we emerged from the red region into the normal brown clay,\r\ngarnished with sage as moors are with heather, over a road which might\r\nhave suggested the nursery rhyme,\r\n\r\n    “Here we go up, up, up,\r\n      There we go down, down, down.”\r\n\r\nAt last it improved, and once more, as if we never were to leave it,\r\nwe fell into the Valley of the Platte. About eight miles from our\r\ndestination we crossed the sandy bed of the La Prêle River, an arroyo\r\nof twenty feet wide, which, like its brethren, brims in spring with\r\nits freight of melted snow. In the clear shade of evening we traversed\r\nthe “timber,” or well-wooded lands lying upon Box-Elder Creek--a\r\nbeautiful little stream some eight feet broad, and at 9 P.M. arrived\r\nat the station. The master, Mr. Wheeler, was exceptionably civil and\r\ncommunicative; he lent us buffalo robes for the night, and sent us to\r\nbed after the best supper the house could afford. We were not, however,\r\nto be balked of our proper pleasure, a “good grumble,” so we hooked it\r\non to another peg. One of the road-agents had just arrived from Great\r\nSalt Lake City in a neat private ambulance after a journey of three\r\ndays, while we could hardly expect to make it under treble that time.\r\nIt was agreed on all sides that such conduct was outrageous; that\r\nMessrs. Russell and Co. amply deserved to have their contract taken\r\nfrom them, and--on these occasions your citizen looks portentous, and\r\ndeals darkly in threatenings, as if his single vote could shake the\r\nspheres--we came to a mutual understanding that _that_ firm should\r\nnever enjoy our countenance or support. We were unanimous; all, even\r\nthe mortal quarrel, was “made up” in the presence of the general foe,\r\nthe Mail Company. Briefly we retired to rest, a miserable Public, and,\r\nsoothed by the rough lullaby of the coyote, whose shrieks and screams\r\nperfectly reproduced the Indian jackal, we passed into the world of\r\ndreams.\r\n\r\n  _To Platte Bridge. August 16th._\r\n\r\n[CLIMATE.]\r\n\r\nAt 8 30 A.M. we were once more under way along the valley of Father\r\nPlatte, whose physiognomy had now notably changed for the better.\r\nInstead of the dull, dark, silent stream of the lower course, whose\r\nmuddy monotonous aspect made it a grievance to behold, we descried with\r\nastonishment a bright little river, hardly a hundred yards wide--one’s\r\nideas of potamology are enlarged with a witness by American travel! a\r\nmirrory surface, and waters clear and limpid as the ether above them.\r\nThe limestones and marls which destroy the beauty of the Lower Platte\r\ndo not extend to the upper course. The climate now became truly\r\ndelicious. The height above sea-level--5000 feet--subjects the land to\r\nthe wholesome action of gentle winds, which, about 10-11 A.M., when\r\nthe earth has had time to air, set in regularly as the sea-breezes\r\nof tropical climes, and temper the keen shine of day. These higher\r\ngrounds, where the soil is barren rather for want of water than from\r\nthe character of its constituents, are undoubtedly the healthiest part\r\nof the plains: no noxious malaria is evolved from the sparse growth of\r\ntree and shrub upon the banks of the river; and beyond them the plague\r\nof brûlés (sand-flies) and musquetoes is unknown; the narrowness of\r\nthe bed also prevents the shrinking of the stream in autumn, at which\r\nseason the Lower Platte exposes two broad margins of black infected\r\nmire. The three great elements of unhealthiness, heavy and clammy\r\ndews, moisture exhaled from the earth’s surface, and the overcrowding\r\nof population--which appears to generate as many artificial diseases\r\nas artificial wants--are here unknown: the soil is never turned up,\r\nand even if it were, it probably would not have the deleterious effect\r\nwhich climatologists have remarked in the damp hot regions near the\r\nequator. The formation of the land begins to change from the tertiary\r\nand cretaceous to the primary--granites and porphyries--warning us that\r\nwe are approaching the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\n[THE FIRST MORMONS.]\r\n\r\nOn the road we saw for the first time a train of Mormon wagons,\r\ntwenty-four in number, slowly wending their way toward the Promised\r\nLand. The “Captain”--those who fill the dignified office of guides are\r\nso designated, and once a captain always a captain is the Far Western\r\nrule--was young Brigham Young, a nephew of the Prophet; a _blondin_,\r\nwith yellow hair and beard, an intelligent countenance, a six-shooter\r\nby his right, and a bowie-knife by his left side. It was impossible\r\nto mistake, even through the veil of freckles and sun-burn with which\r\na two months’ journey had invested them, the nationality of the\r\nemigrants; “British-English” was written in capital letters upon the\r\nwhite eyelashes and tow-colored curls of the children, and upon the\r\nsandy brown hair and staring eyes, heavy bodies, and ample extremities\r\nof the adults. One young person concealed her facial attractions under\r\na manner of mask. I thought that perhaps she might be a sultana,\r\nreserved for the establishment of some very magnificent Mormon bashaw;\r\nbut the driver, when appealed to, responded with contempt, “’Guess old\r\nBriggy wont stampede many o’ that ’ere lot!” Though thus homely in\r\nappearance, few showed any symptoms of sickness or starvation; in fact,\r\ntheir condition first impressed us most favorably with the excellence\r\nof the Perpetual Emigration Funds’ traveling arrangements.\r\n\r\nThe Mormons who can afford such luxury generally purchase for the\r\ntransit of the plains an emigrant’s wagon, which in the West seldom\r\ncosts more than $185. They take a full week before well _en route_,\r\nand endeavor to leave the Mississippi in early May, when “long forage”\r\nis plentiful upon the prairies. Those prospecting parties who are bound\r\nfor California set out in March or April, feeding their animals with\r\ngrain till the new grass appears; after November the road over the\r\nSierra Nevada being almost impassable to way-worn oxen. The ground in\r\nthe low parts of the Mississippi Valley becomes heavy and muddy after\r\nthe first spring rains, and by starting in good time the worst parts of\r\nthe country will be passed before the travel becomes very laborious.\r\nMoreover, grass soon disappears from the higher and less productive\r\ntracts; between Scott’s Bluffs and Great Salt Lake City we were seldom\r\nout of sight of starved cattle, and on one spot I counted fifteen\r\nskeletons. Travelers, however, should not push forward early, unless\r\ntheir animals are in good condition and are well supplied with grain;\r\nthe last year’s grass is not quite useless, but cattle can not thrive\r\nupon it as they will upon the grammas, festucas, and buffalo clover\r\n(_Trifolium reflexum_) of Utah and New Mexico. The journey between St.\r\nJo and the Mormon capital usually occupies from two to three months.\r\nThe Latter-Day Saints march with a quasi-military organization. Other\r\nemigrants form companies of fifty to seventy armed men--a single\r\nwagon would be in imminent danger from rascals like the Pawnees,\r\nwho, though fonder of bullying than of fighting, are ever ready to\r\ncut off a straggler--elect their “Cap.,” who holds the office only\r\nduring good conduct, sign and seal themselves to certain obligations,\r\nand bind themselves to stated penalties in case of disobedience or\r\ndefection. The “Prairie Traveler” strongly recommends this systematic\r\norganization, without which, indeed, no expedition, whether emigrant,\r\ncommercial, or exploratory, ought ever or in any part of the world\r\nto begin its labors; justly observing that, without it, discords and\r\ndissensions sooner or later arise which invariably result in breaking\r\nup the company.\r\n\r\n[MORMON OUTFIT.]\r\n\r\nIn this train I looked to no purpose for the hand-carts with which the\r\npoorer Saints add to the toils of earthly travel a semi-devotional work\r\nof supererogation expected to win a proportionate reward in heaven.[81]\r\n\r\n  [81] The following estimate of outfit was given to me by a Mormon\r\n  elder, who has frequently traveled over the Utah route. He was\r\n  accompanied by his wife, and family, and help--six persons in total;\r\n  and having money to spare, he invested it in a speculation which\r\n  could hardly fail at least to quadruple his outlay at the end of\r\n  the march: the stove, for instance, bought at $28, would sell for\r\n  $80 to $120. The experienced emigrant, it may be observed, carries\r\n  with him a little of every thing that may or might be wanted, such\r\n  as provisions, clothing, furniture, drugs, lint, stationery, spices,\r\n  ammunition, and so forth; above all things, he looks to his weapons\r\n  as likely to be, at a pinch, his best friends:\r\n\r\n  2 yokes oxen                                        at $180 to $200 00\r\n  1 cow (milch)                                                    25 00\r\n  1 wagon                                                          87 30\r\n  1 double cover                                                    8 50\r\n  2 ox yokes                                                        8 00\r\n  1 ox chain                                                        1 50\r\n  1 tar-bucket                                                      1 00\r\n  1 large tent ($9 for smaller sizes)                              15 00\r\n  Camp equipment, axes, spades, shovels, triangles for fires, etc. 10 00\r\n  600 lbs. flour                                                   25 50\r\n  100 lbs. ham and bacon                                           14 00\r\n  150 lbs. crackers (sea biscuits)                                 13 13\r\n  100 lbs. sugar                                                    9 50\r\n   25 lbs. crystallized ditto                                       3 00\r\n   24 lbs. raisins                                                  4 00\r\n   20 lbs. currants                                                 3 00\r\n   25 lbs. rice                                                     2 25\r\n  1 bushel dried apples                                             6 00\r\n  1   „      „   peaches                                            4 30\r\n  1   „    beans                                                    2 00\r\n  1 stove                                                          28 00\r\n                                                                 -------\r\n             Grand total                                         $490 98\r\n\r\nAfter ten miles of the usual number of creeks, “Deep,” “Small,” “Snow,”\r\n“Muddy,” etc., and heavy descents, we reached at 10 A.M. Deer Creek,\r\na stream about thirty feet wide, said to abound in fish. The station\r\nboasts of an Indian agent, Major Twiss, a post-office, a store, and of\r\ncourse a grog-shop. M. Bissonette, the owner of the two latter and an\r\nold Indian trader, was the usual Creole, speaking a French not unlike\r\nthat of the Channel Islands, and wide awake to the advantages derivable\r\nfrom travelers: the large straggling establishment seemed to produce in\r\nabundance large squaws and little half-breeds. Fortunately stimulants\r\nare not much required on the plains: I wish my enemy no more terrible\r\nfate than to drink excessively with M. Bissonette of M. Bissonette’s\r\nliquor. The good Creole, when asked to join us, naïvely refused: he\r\nreminded me of certain wine-merchants in more civilized lands, who,\r\nwhen dining with their pratique, sensibly prefer small-beer to their\r\nown concoctions.\r\n\r\n[BUNCH-GRASS.]\r\n\r\nA delay of fifteen minutes, and then we were hurried forward. The\r\nravines deepened; we were about entering the region of kanyons.[82]\r\nAlready we began to descry bunch-grass clothing the hills. This\r\ninvaluable and anomalous provision of nature is first found, I believe,\r\nabout fifty miles westward of the meridian of Fort Laramie, and it\r\nextends to the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada. On the Pacific\r\nwater-shed it gives way to the wild oats (_Avena fatua_), which are\r\nsupposed to have been introduced into California by the Spaniards. The\r\nfestuca is a real boon to the land, which, without it, could hardly be\r\ntraversed by cattle. It grows by clumps, as its name denotes, upon the\r\nmost unlikely ground, the thirsty sand, and the stony hills; in fact,\r\nit thrives best upon the poorest soil. In autumn, about September, when\r\nall other grasses turn to hay, and their nutriment is washed out by the\r\nautumnal rains, the bunch-grass, after shedding its seed, begins to put\r\nforth a green shoot within the apparently withered sheath. It remains\r\njuicy and nutritious, like winter wheat in April, under the snows, and,\r\ncontrary to the rule of the _gramineæ_, it pays the debt of nature,\r\ndrying and dying about May; yet, even when in its corpse-like state, a\r\nlight yellow straw, it contains abundant and highly-flavored nutriment;\r\nit lasts through the summer, retiring up the mountains, again becomes\r\ngrass in January, thus feeding cattle all the year round. The small\r\ndark pyriform seed, about half the size of an oat, is greedily devoured\r\nby stock, and has been found to give an excellent flavor to beef and\r\nmutton. It is curious how little food will fatten animals upon the\r\nelevated portions of the prairies and in the valleys of the Rocky\r\nMountains. I remarked the same thing in Somaliland, where, while far as\r\nthe eye could see the country wore the semblance of one vast limestone\r\nledge, white with desolation, the sheep and bullocks were round and\r\nplump as stall-fed animals. The idea forces itself upon one’s mind\r\nthat the exceeding purity and limpidity of the air, by perfecting\r\nthe processes of digestion and assimilation, must stand in lieu of\r\nquantity. I brought back with me a small packet of the bunch-grass\r\nseed, in the hope that it may be acclimatized: the sandy lands about\r\nAldershott, for instance, would be admirably fitted for the growth.\r\n\r\n  [82] The Spanish cañon--Americanized to kanyon--signifies, primarily,\r\n  a cannon or gun-barrel; secondarily, a tube, shaft of a mine, or a\r\n  ravine of peculiar form, common in this part of America. The word\r\n  is loosely applied by the Western men, but properly it means those\r\n  gorges through a line of mountains whose walls are high and steep,\r\n  even to a tunnel-like overhanging, while their soles, which afford\r\n  passages to streams, are almost flat. In Northern Mexico the kanyon\r\n  becomes of stupendous dimensions; it is sometimes a crack in the\r\n  plains 2000 feet deep, exposing all the layers that clothe earth’s\r\n  core, with a stream at the bottom, in sight, but impossible for the\r\n  traveler dying of thirst to drink at.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at a station, called the “Little Muddy Creek,” after a hot\r\ndrive of twenty miles. It was a wretched place, built of “dry stones,”\r\nviz., slabs without mortar, and the interior was garnished with certain\r\nefforts of pictorial art, which were rather _lestes_ than otherwise.\r\nThe furniture was composed of a box and a trunk, and the negative\r\ncatalogue of its supplies was extensive--whisky forming the only\r\npositive item.\r\n\r\nWe were not sorry to resume our journey at 1 15 P.M. After eight miles\r\nwe crossed the vile bridge which spans “Snow Creek,” a deep water, and\r\nhardly six feet wide. According to the station-men, water here was once\r\nperennial, though now reduced to an occasional freshet after rain: this\r\nphenomenon, they say, is common in the country, and they attribute it\r\nto the sinking of the stream in the upper parts of the bed, which have\r\nbecome porous, or have given way. It is certain that in the Sinaitic\r\nregions many springs, which within a comparatively few years supplied\r\nwhole families of Bedouins, have unaccountably dried up; perhaps the\r\nsame thing happens in the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nAfter about two hours of hot sun, we debouched upon the bank of the\r\nPlatte at a spot where once was the Lower Ferry.[83] The river bed is\r\nhere so full of holes and quicksands, and the stream is so cold and\r\nswift, that many have been drowned when bathing, more when attempting\r\nto save time by fording it. A wooden bridge was built at this point\r\nsome years ago, at an expense of $26,000, by one Regshaw, who, if\r\nreport does not belie him, has gained and lost more fortunes than a\r\nWall Street professional “lame duck.” We halted for a few minutes at\r\nthe indispensable store--the _tête de pont_--and drank our whisky with\r\nice, which, after so long a disuse, felt unenjoyably cold. Remounting,\r\nwe passed a deserted camp, where in times gone by two companies of\r\ninfantry had been stationed: a few stumps of crumbling wall, broken\r\nfloorings, and depressions in the ground, were the only remnants which\r\nthe winds and rains had left. The banks of the Platte were stained with\r\ncoal: it has been known to exist for some years, but has only lately\r\nbeen worked. Should the supply prove sufficient for the wants of the\r\nsettlers, it will do more toward the civilization of these regions than\r\nthe discovery of gold.\r\n\r\n  [83] The first ferry, according to the old guide-books, was at Deer\r\n  Creek; the second was at this place, thirty-one miles above the\r\n  former; and the third was four miles still farther on.\r\n\r\n[COAL-BEDS.]\r\n\r\nThe lignite tertiary of Nebraska extends north and west to the British\r\nline; the beds are found throughout this formation sometimes six and\r\nseven feet thick, and the article would make good fuel. The true\r\ncoal-measures have been discovered in the southeastern portion of the\r\nNebraska prairies, and several small seams at different points of the\r\nPlatte Valley. Dr. F. V. Hayden, who accompanied Lieutenant Warren\r\nas geologist, appears to think that the limestones which contain the\r\nsupplies, though belonging to the true coal-measures, hold a position\r\nabove the workable beds of coal, and deems it improbable that mines of\r\nany importance will be found north of the southern line of Nebraska.\r\nBut, as his examination of the ground was somewhat hurried, there is\r\nroom to hope that this unfavorable verdict will be canceled. The coal\r\nas yet discovered is all, I believe, bituminous. That dug out of the\r\nPlatte bank runs in a vein about six feet thick, and is as hard as\r\ncannel coal: the texture of the rock is a white limestone. The banks\r\nof the Deer and other neighboring creeks are said also to contain the\r\nrequisites for fuel.\r\n\r\n[TOLL-BRIDGE.]\r\n\r\nOur station lay near the upper crossing or second bridge, a short\r\ndistance from the town. It was also built of timber at an expense\r\nof $40,000, about a year ago, by Louis Guenot, a Quebecquois, who\r\nhas passed the last twelve years upon the plains. He appeared very\r\ndowncast about his temporal prospects, and handed us over, with the\r\n_insouciance_ of his race, to the tender mercies of his venerable\r\nsquaw. The usual toll is 50 cents, but from trains, especially of\r\nMormons, the owner will claim $5; in fact, as much as he can get\r\nwithout driving them to the opposition lower bridge, or to the\r\nferry-boat. It was impossible to touch the squaw’s supper; the tin cans\r\nthat contained the coffee were slippery with grease, and the bacon\r\nlooked as if it had been dressed side by side with “boyaux.” I lighted\r\nmy pipe, and, air-cane in hand, sallied forth to look at the country.\r\n\r\nThe heights behind the station were our old friends the Black Hills,\r\nwhich, according to the Canadian, extend with few breaks as far as\r\nDenver City. They are covered with dark green pine; at a distance it\r\nlooks black, and the woods shelter a variety of wild beasts, the\r\ngrizzly bear among the number. In the more grassy spaces mustangs,\r\nsure-footed as mountain goats, roam uncaught; and at the foot of the\r\nhills the slopes are well stocked with antelope, deer, and hares,\r\nhere called rabbits. The principal birds are the sage-hen (_Tetrao\r\nurophasianus_) and the prairie-hen (_T. pratensis_). The former,\r\nalso called the cock of the plains, is a fine, strong-flying grouse,\r\nabout the size of a full-grown barn-door fowl, or, when younger, of\r\na European pheasant, which, indeed, the form of the tail, as the\r\nname denotes, greatly resembles, and the neck is smooth like the\r\npartridge of the Old World.[84] Birds of the year are considered good\r\neating: after their first winter the flesh is so impregnated with the\r\nintolerable odor of wild sage that none but a starving man can touch\r\nit. The prairie-hen, also called the “heath-hen” and the “pinnated\r\ngrouse,” affects the plains of Illinois and Missouri, and is rarely\r\nfound so far west as the Black Hills: it is not a migratory bird. The\r\npinnæ from which it derives its name are little wing-like tufts on both\r\nsides of the neck, small in the female, large in the male. The cock,\r\nmoreover, has a stripe of skin running down the neck, which changes its\r\nnatural color toward pairing-time, and becomes of a reddish yellow: it\r\nswells like a turkey-cock’s wattles, till the head seems buried between\r\ntwo monstrous protuberances, the owner spreading out its tail, sweeping\r\nthe ground with its wings, and booming somewhat like a bittern. Both of\r\nthese birds, which are strong on the wing, and give good sport, might\r\nprobably be naturalized in Europe, and the “Société d’Acclimatisation”\r\nwould do well to think of it.\r\n\r\n  [84] The trivial names for organic nature are as confused and\r\n  confusing in America as in India, in consequence of the Old Country\r\n  terms applied, _per fas et nefas_, to New Country growths: for\r\n  instance, the spruce grouse is the Canadian partridge; the ruffled\r\n  grouse is the partridge of New England and New York, and the pheasant\r\n  of New Jersey and the Southern States; while in the latter the common\r\n  quail (_O. Virginiana_) is called “partridge.”\r\n\r\n[THE WAR-PARTY.]\r\n\r\nReturning to the station, I found that a war-party of Arapahoes had\r\njust alighted in a thin copse hard by. They looked less like warriors\r\nthan like a band of horse-stealers; and, though they had set out with\r\nthe determination of bringing back some Yuta scalps and fingers,[85]\r\nthey had not succeeded. On these occasions the young braves are\r\ngenerally very sulky--a fact which they take care to show by short\r\nspeech and rude gestures, throwing about and roughly handling, like\r\nspoiled children, whatever comes in their way. At such times one must\r\nalways be prepared for a word and a blow; and, indeed, most Indian\r\nfighters justify themselves in taking the initiative, as, of course, it\r\nis a great thing to secure first chance. However we may yearn toward\r\nour “poor black brother,” it is hard not to sympathize with the white\r\nin many aggressions against the ferocious and capricious so-called\r\nRed Man. The war-party consisted of about a dozen warriors, with a\r\nfew limber, lither-looking lads. They had sundry lean, sore-backed\r\nnags, which were presently turned out to graze. Dirty rags formed the\r\ndress of the band; their arms were the usual light lances, garnished\r\nwith leather at the handles, with two cropped tufts and a long loose\r\nfeather dangling from them. They had bows shaped like the Grecian\r\nCupid’s, strengthened with sinews and tipped with wire, and arrows of\r\nlight wood, with three feathers--Captain Marcy says, two intersecting\r\nat right angles; but I have never seen this arrangement--and small\r\ntriangular iron piles. Their shields were plain targes--double folds\r\nof raw buffalo hide, apparently unstuffed, and quite unadorned. They\r\ncarried mangy buffalo robes; and scattered upon the ground was a\r\nvariety of belts, baldricks, and pouches, with split porcupine quills\r\ndyed a saffron yellow.\r\n\r\n  [85] The enemy’s fore or other finger, crooked and tied with two\r\n  bits of the skin which are attached to the wrist or the forehead,\r\n  is a favorite and picturesque ornament. That failing, the bear’s\r\n  (especially the grizzly’s) talons, bored at the base, and strung upon\r\n  their sinews, are considered highly honorable.\r\n\r\nThe Arapahoes, generally pronounced ’Rapahoes--called by their\r\nShoshonee neighbors Sháretikeh, or Dog-eaters, and by the French\r\nGros Ventres--are a tribe of thieves living between the South Fork\r\nof the Platte and the Arkansas Rivers. They are bounded north by the\r\nSioux, and hunt in the same grounds with the Cheyennes. This breed is\r\nconsidered fierce, treacherous, and unfriendly to the whites, who have\r\ndebauched and diseased them, while the Cheyennes are comparatively\r\nchaste and uninfected. The Arapaho is distinguished from the Dakotah\r\nby the superior gauntness of his person, and the boldness of his\r\nlook; there are also minor points of difference in the moccasins,\r\narrow-marks, and weapons. His language, like that of the Cheyennes,\r\nhas never, I am told, been thoroughly learned by a stranger: it is\r\nsaid to contain but a few hundred words, and these, being almost all\r\nexplosive growls or guttural grants, are with difficulty acquired by\r\nthe civilized ear. Like the Cheyennes, the Arapahoes have been somewhat\r\ntamed of late by the transit of the United States army in 1857.\r\n\r\nAmong the Prairie Indians, when a war-chief has matured the plans\r\nfor an expedition, he habits himself in the garb of battle. Then,\r\nmounting his steed, and carrying a lance adorned with a flag and\r\neagle’s feathers, he rides about the camp chanting his war-song. Those\r\ndisposed to volunteer join the parade, also on horseback, and, after\r\nsufficiently exhibiting themselves to the admiration of the village,\r\nreturn home. This ceremony continues till the requisite number is\r\ncollected. The war-dance, and the rites of the medicine-man, together\r\nwith perhaps private penances and propitiations, are the next step.\r\nThere are also copious powwows, in which, as in the African parlance,\r\nthe chiefs, elders, and warriors sit for hours in grim debate, solemn\r\nas if the fate of empires hung upon their words, to decide the\r\nmomentous question whether Jack shall have half a pound more meat than\r\nJim. Neither the chief nor the warriors are finally committed by the\r\nprocession to the expedition; they are all volunteers, at liberty to\r\nretire; and jealousy, disappointment, and superstition often interpose\r\nbetween themselves and glory.\r\n\r\nThe war-party, when gone, is thoroughly gone; once absent, they love to\r\nwork in mystery, and look forward mainly to the pleasure of surprising\r\ntheir friends. After an absence which may extend for months, a loud,\r\npiercing, peculiar cry suddenly announces the vanguard courier of the\r\nreturning braves. The camp is thrown at once from the depths of apathy\r\nto the height of excitement, which is also the acmé of enjoyment for\r\nthose whose lives must be spent in forced inaction. The warriors enter\r\nwith their faces painted black, and their steeds decorated in the\r\nmost fantastic style; the women scream and howl their exultation, and\r\nfeasting and merriment follow with the ceremonious scalp-dance. The\r\nbraves are received with various degrees of honor according to their\r\ndeeds. The highest merit is to ride single-handed into the enemy’s\r\ncamp, and to smite a lodge with lance or bow. The second is to take\r\na warrior prisoner. The third is to strike a dead or fallen man--an\r\nidea somewhat contrary to the Englishman’s fancies of fair play,\r\nbut intelligible enough where it is the custom, as in Hindostan, to\r\nlie upon the ground “playing ’possum,” and waiting the opportunity\r\nto hamstring or otherwise disable the opponent. The least of great\r\nachievements is to slay an enemy in hand-to-hand fight. A Pyrrhic\r\nvictory, won even at an inconsiderable loss, is treated as a defeat;\r\nthe object of the Indian guerrilla chief is to destroy the foe with as\r\nlittle risk to himself and his men as possible; this is his highest\r\nboast, and in this are all his hopes of fame. Should any of the party\r\nfall in battle, the relatives mourn by cutting off their hair and the\r\nmanes and tails of their horses, and the lugubrious lamentations of the\r\nwomen introduce an ugly element into the triumphal procession.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, as Mrs. Dana, her husband, and I were sitting outside\r\nthe station, two of the warriors came and placed themselves without\r\nceremony upon the nearest stones. They were exceedingly unprepossessing\r\nwith their small gipsy eyes, high, rugged cheek-bones, broad flat\r\nfaces, coarse sensual mouths everted as to the lips, and long heavy\r\nchins; they had removed every sign of manhood from their faces, and\r\ntheir complexions were a dull oily red, the result of vermilion, ochre,\r\nor some such pigment, of which they are as fond as Hindoos, grimed in\r\nfor years. They watched every gesture, and at times communicated their\r\nopinions to each other in undistinguishable gruntings, with curious\r\nattempts at cachinnation. It is said that the wild dog is unable to\r\nbark, and that the tame variety has acquired the faculty by attempting\r\nto imitate the human voice; it is certain that, as a rule, only the\r\ncivilized man can laugh loudly and heartily. I happened to mention to\r\nmy fellow-travelers the universal dislike of savages to any thing\r\nlike a sketch of their physiognomies; they expressed a doubt that the\r\nIndians were subject to the rule. Pencil and paper were at hand, so\r\nwe proceeded to proof. The savage at first seemed uneasy under the\r\noperation, as the Asiatic or African will do, averting his face at\r\ntimes, and shifting position to defeat my purpose. When I passed the\r\ncaricature round it excited some merriment; the subject, forthwith\r\nrising from his seat, made a sign that he also wished to see it. At\r\nthe sight, however, he screwed up his features with an expression of\r\nintense disgust, and managing to “smudge” over the sketch with his\r\ndirty thumb, he left us with a “pooh!” that told all his outraged\r\nfeelings.\r\n\r\n[SMOKING.]\r\n\r\nPresently the warriors entered the station to smoke and tacitly beg for\r\nbroken victuals. They squatted in a circle, and passed round the red\r\nsandstone calumet with great gravity, puffing like steam-tugs, inhaling\r\nslowly and lingeringly, swallowing the fumes, and with upturned faces\r\nexhaling them through the nostrils. They made no objection to being\r\njoined by us, and always before handing the pipe to a neighbor, they\r\nwiped the reed mouth-piece with the cushion of the thumb. The contents\r\nof their calumet were kinnikinik, and, though they accepted tobacco,\r\nthey preferred replenishing with their own mixture. They received a\r\nsmall present of provisions, and when the station-people went to supper\r\nthey were shut out.\r\n\r\n[MORMONLAND NEAR.]\r\n\r\nWe are now slipping into Mormonland; one of the station-keepers\r\nbelonged to the new religion. The “madam,” on entering the room, had\r\nrequested him to depose a cigar which tainted the air with a perfume\r\nlike that of greens’-water; he took the matter so coolly that I\r\ndetermined he was not an American, and, true enough, he proved to be\r\na cabinet-maker from Birmingham. I spent the evening reading poor\r\nAlbert Smith’s “Story of Mont Blanc”--Mont Blanc in sight of the\r\nRocky Mountains!--and admiring how the prince of entertainers led\r\nup the reader to what he called the crowning glory of his life, the\r\nunperilous ascent of that monarch of the Alps, much in the spirit with\r\nwhich one would have addressed the free and independent voters of some\r\nwell-bribed English borough.\r\n\r\nWe are now about to quit the region which Nature has prepared, by\r\nready-made roads and embankments, for a railway; all beyond this\r\npoint difficulties are so heaped upon difficulties--as the sequel\r\nwill prove--that we must hope against hope to see the “iron horse” (I\r\nbelieve he is so called) holding his way over the mountains.\r\n\r\n  _17th August. To the Valley of the Sweetwater._\r\n\r\nThe morning was bright and clear, cool and pleasant. The last night’s\r\nabstinence had told upon our squeamishness: we managed to secure a\r\nfowl, and with its aid we overcame our repugnance to the massive slices\r\nof eggless bacon. At 6 30 A.M. we hitched up, crossed the rickety\r\nbridge at a slow pace, and proceeded for the first time to ascend\r\nthe left bank of the Platte. The valley was grassy; the eternal sage,\r\nhowever, haunted us; the grouse ran before us, and the prairie-dogs\r\nsquatted upon their house-tops, enjoying the genial morning rays. After\r\nten miles of severe ups and downs, which, by-the-by, nearly brought our\r\nconsort, the official’s wagon, to grief, we halted for a few minutes at\r\nan old-established trading-post called “Red Buttes.”[86] The feature\r\nfrom which it derives its name lies on the right bank of, and about\r\nfive miles distant from the river, which here cuts its way through a\r\nridge. These bluffs are a fine bold formation, escarpments of ruddy\r\nargillaceous sandstones and shells, which dip toward the west: they are\r\nthe eastern wall of the mass that hems in the stream, and rear high\r\nabove it their conical heads and fantastic figures. The ranch was on\r\nthe margin of a cold, clear spring, of which we vainly attempted to\r\ndrink. The banks were white, as though by hoar-frost, with nitrate and\r\ncarbonate of soda efflorescing from the dark mould. Near Red Buttes the\r\nwater is said to have a chalybeate flavor, but of that we were unable\r\nto judge.\r\n\r\n  [86] The French word is extensively used in the Rocky Mountains and\r\n  Oregon, “where,” says Colonel Frémont (“Expedition to the Rocky\r\n  Mountains,” p. 145), “it is naturalized, and which, if desirable to\r\n  render into English, there is no word which would be its precise\r\n  equivalent. It is applied to the detached hills and ridges which rise\r\n  abruptly and reach too high to be called hills or ridges, and are not\r\n  high enough”--he might have added, are not massive enough--“to be\r\n  called mountains. _Knob_, as applied in the Western States, is their\r\n  most descriptive term in English; but no translation or periphrasis\r\n  would preserve the identity of these picturesque landmarks.”\r\n\r\nHaving allowed the squaws and half-breeds a few minutes to gaze, we\r\nresumed our way, taking off our caps in token of adieu to old Father\r\nPlatte, our companion for many a weary mile. We had traced his course\r\nupward, through its various phases and vicissitudes, from the dignity\r\nand portliness of his later career as a full-grown river to his small\r\nand humble youth as a mountain rivulet, and--interest, either in man\r\nor stream, often results from the trouble we take about them--I looked\r\nupon him for the last time with a feeling akin to regret. Moreover,\r\nwe had been warned that from the crossing of the North Platte to the\r\nSweetwater all is a dry, and dreary, and desolate waste.\r\n\r\nOn the way we met a mounted Indian, armed with a rifle, and habited\r\nin the most grotesque costume. “Jack”--he was recognized by the\r\ndriver--wore a suit of buckskin, and a fool’s cap made out of an old\r\nblanket, with a pair of ass-ear appendages that hung backward viciously\r\nlike a mule’s; his mouth grinned from ear to ear, and his eyes were\r\nprotected by glass and wire goggles, which gave them the appearance\r\nof being mounted on stalks like a crustacean’s. He followed us for\r\nsome distance, honoring us by riding close to the carriage, in hopes\r\nof a little black-mail; but we were not generous, and we afterward\r\nheard something which made us glad that we had not been tempted to\r\nliberality. He was followed by an ill-favored squaw, dressed in a kind\r\nof cotton gown, remarkable only for the shoulders being considerably\r\nnarrower than the waist. She sat her bare nag cavalierly, and eyed us\r\nas we passed with that peculiarly unpleasant glance which plain women\r\nare so fond of bestowing.\r\n\r\n[THE DEVIL’S BACKBONE.]\r\n\r\nAfter eighteen miles’ drive we descended a steep hill, and were shown\r\nthe Devil’s Backbone. It is a jagged, broken ridge of huge sandstone\r\nboulders, tilted up edgeways, and running in a line over the crest of\r\na long roll of land: the _tout ensemble_ looks like the vertebræ of\r\nsome great sea-serpent or other long crawling animal; and, on a nearer\r\nview, the several pieces resolve themselves into sphinxes, veiled\r\nnuns, Lot’s pillars, and other freakish objects. I may here remark\r\nthat the _aut Cæsar aut diabolus_ of the medieval European antiquary,\r\nwhen accounting for the architecture of strange places, is in the Far\r\nWest consigned without partnership to the genius loci, the fiend who,\r\nhere as in Europe, has monopolized all the finest features of scenery.\r\nWe shall pass successively the Devil’s Gate, the Devil’s Post-office,\r\nand the Devil’s Hole--in fact, we shall not be thoroughly rid of his\r\nSatanic majesty’s appurtenances till Monte Diablo, the highest of\r\nthe Californian coast-range, dips slowly and unwillingly behind the\r\nPacific’s tepid wave.\r\n\r\n[WILLOW SPRINGS.]\r\n\r\nWe nooned at Willow Springs, a little doggery boasting of a shed and a\r\nbunk, but no corral; and we soothed, with a drink of our whisky, the\r\nexcited feelings of the rancheros. The poor fellows had been plundered\r\nof their bread and dried meat by some petty thief, who had burrowed\r\nunder the wall, and they sorely suspected our goggled friend, Jack the\r\nArapaho. Master Jack’s hair might have found itself suspended near\r\nthe fireplace if he had then been within rifle-shot; as it was, the\r\ntwo victims could only indulge in consolatory threats about wreaking\r\ntheir vengeance upon the first “doggond red-bellied crittur” whom good\r\nfortune might send in their way. The water was unusually good at Willow\r\nSprings; unfortunately, however, there was nothing else.\r\n\r\nAt 2 30 P.M. we resumed our way through the yellow-flowered\r\nrabbit-bush--it not a little resembled wild mustard--and a thick\r\nsage-heath, which was here and there spangled with the bright blossoms\r\nof the wilderness. After about twenty miles we passed, to the west of\r\nthe road, a curious feature, to which the Mormon exodists first, _on\r\ndit_, gave the name of Saleratus Lake.[87] It lies to the west of\r\nthe road, and is only one of a chain of alkaline waters and springs\r\nwhose fetor, without exaggeration, taints the land. Cattle drinking of\r\nthe fluid are nearly sure to die; even those that eat of the _herbe\r\nsalée_, or salt grass growing upon its borders, and known by its\r\nreddish-yellow and sometimes bluish tinge, will suffer from a disease\r\ncalled the “Alkali,” which not unfrequently kills them. The appearance\r\nof the Saleratus Lake startles the traveler who, in the full blaze of\r\nmidday upon this arid waste, where mirage mocks him at every turn,\r\nsuddenly sees outstretched before his eyes a kind of Wenham Lake\r\nsolidly overfrozen. The illusion is so perfect that I was completely\r\ndeceived, nor could the loud guffaws of the driver bring me at once to\r\nthe conclusion that seeing in this case is not believing. On a near\r\ninspection, the icy surface turns out to be a dust of carbonate of\r\nsoda, concealing beneath it masses of the same material, washed out\r\nof the adjacent soil, and solidified by evaporation. The Latter-Day\r\nSaints were charmed with their _trouvaille_, and laid in stores of the\r\nfetid alkaline matter, as though it had been manna, for their bread and\r\npastry. It is still transported westward, and declared to be purer than\r\nthe saleratus of the shops. Near the lake is a deserted ranch, which\r\nonce enjoyed the title of “Sweetwater Station.”\r\n\r\n  [87] According to Dr. L. D. Gale (Appendix F. to Captain Stansbury’s\r\n  “Expedition to the Great Salt Lake”), who tested specimens of this\r\n  saleratus, “it is composed of the sesquicarbonate of soda, mixed\r\n  with the sulphate of soda and chloride of soda, and is one of the\r\n  native salts called _Trona_, found in the Northern Lakes, in Hungary,\r\n  Africa, and other countries.”\r\n\r\n  “Three grammes of this salt in dry powder, cleared of its earthy\r\n  impurities, gave carbonic acid 0·9030 of a gramme, which would\r\n  indicate 1·73239 grammes of the sesquicarbonate. The other salts were\r\n  found to be the muriate and sulphate of soda: the proportions were\r\n  not determined.”\r\n\r\n[ROCK INDEPENDENCE.]\r\n\r\nFour miles beyond this “Waterless Lake”--Bahr bila Ma as the Bedouin\r\nwould call it--we arrived at Rock Independence, and felt ourselves\r\nin a new region, totally distinct from the clay formation of the\r\nmauvaises terres over which we have traveled for the last five days.\r\nAgain I was startled by its surprising likeness to the scenery of\r\nEastern Africa: a sketch of Jiwe la Mkoa, the Round Rock in eastern\r\nUnyamwezi,[88] would be mistaken, even by those who had seen both,\r\nfor this grand _échantillon_ of the Rocky Mountains. It crops out\r\nof an open plain, not far from the river bed, in dome shape wholly\r\nisolated, about 1000 feet in length by 400-500 in breadth; it is 60 to\r\n100 feet in height,[89] and in circumference 1¹⁄₂ to 2 miles. Except\r\nupon the summit, where it has been weathered into a feldspathic soil,\r\nit is bare and bald; a scanty growth of shrubs protrudes, however,\r\nfrom its poll. The material of the stern-looking dome is granite, in\r\nenormous slabs and boulders, cracked, flaked, seared, and cloven, as\r\nif by igneous pressure from below. The prevailing tradition in the\r\nWest is, that the mass derived its name from the fact that Colonel\r\nFrémont there delivered an Independence-day oration; but read a\r\nlittle farther. It is easily ascended at the northern side and the\r\nsoutheastern corner, and many climb its rugged flanks for a peculiarly\r\nAnglo-American purpose--Smith and Brown have held high jinks here.\r\nIn Colonel Frémont’s time (1842), every where within six or eight\r\nfeet of the ground, where the surface is sufficiently smooth, and in\r\nsome places sixty or eighty feet above, the rock was inscribed with\r\nthe names of travelers. Hence the Indians have named it Timpe Nabor,\r\nor the Painted Rock, corresponding with the Sinaitic “Wady Mukattab.”\r\nIn the present day, though much of the writing has been washed away\r\nby rain, 40,000-50,000 souls are calculated to have left their dates\r\nand marks from the coping of the wall to the loose stones below this\r\nhuge sign-post. There is, however, some reason in the proceeding; it\r\ndoes not in these lands begin and end with the silly purpose, as among\r\nclimbers of the Pyramids, and _fouilleurs_ of the sarcophagi of Apis,\r\nto bequeath one’s few poor letters to a little athanasia. Prairie\r\ntravelers and emigrants expect to be followed by their friends, and\r\nleave, in their vermilion outfit, or their white house-paint, or their\r\nbrownish-black tar--a useful article for wagons--a homely but hearty\r\nword of love or direction upon any conspicuous object. Even a bull or a\r\nbuffalo’s skull, which, lying upon the road, will attract attention, is\r\nmade to do duty at this _Poste Restante_.\r\n\r\n  [88] I crave the reader’s pardon for referring him to my own\r\n  publications; but the only account of this Round Rock which has\r\n  hitherto been published is to be found in the “Lake Regions of\r\n  Central Africa,” chap. viii.\r\n\r\n  [89] Colonel Frémont gives its dimensions as 650 yards long and 40\r\n  feet high.\r\n\r\nI will here take the liberty of digressing a little, with the\r\ncharitable purpose of admiring the serious turn with which the United\r\nStates explorers perform their explorations.\r\n\r\nColonel Frémont[90] thus calls to mind the earnest deeds of a bygone\r\nday. “One George Weymouth was sent out to Maine by the Earl of\r\nSouthampton, Lord Arundel, and others, and in the narrative of their\r\ndiscoveries he says, ‘The next day we ascended in our pinnace that\r\npart of the river which lies more to the westward, carrying with us\r\na cross--a thing never omitted by any Christian traveler--which we\r\nerected at the ultimate end of our route.’ This was in the year 1605,\r\nand in 1842 I obeyed the feeling of early travelers, and left the\r\nimpressions of the cross deeply engraved on the vast rock, one thousand\r\nmiles beyond the Mississippi, to which discoverers have given the\r\nnational name of Rock Independence.”\r\n\r\n  [90] Report of the Exploring Expedition to the Rocky Mountains, p. 72.\r\n\r\nCaptain Stansbury[91] is not less scrupulous upon the subject of\r\ntraveling proprieties. One of his entries is couched as follows:\r\n“Sunday, June 10, barometer 28·82, thermometer 70°. The camp rested:\r\nit had been determined, from the commencement of the expedition, to\r\ndevote this day, whenever practicable, to its legitimate purpose, as\r\nan interval of rest for man and beast. I here beg to record, as the\r\nresult of my experience, derived not only from the present journey, but\r\nfrom the observations of many years spent in the performance of similar\r\nduties, that, as a mere matter of pecuniary consideration, apart from\r\nall higher obligations, it is wise to keep the Sabbath.”\r\n\r\n  [91] Stansbury’s Expedition, ch. i., p. 22.\r\n\r\nLieutenant W. F. Lynch, United States Navy, who in 1857 commanded the\r\nUnited States Expedition to the River Jordan and the Dead Sea,[92] and\r\npublished a narrative not deficient in interest, thus describes his\r\nproceedings at El Meshra, the bathing-place of the Christian pilgrims:\r\n\r\n  [92] Chap. iii. Authorized Edition. Sampson Low, Son, and Co., 47\r\n  Ludgate Hill, 1859.\r\n\r\n“This ground is consecrated by tradition as the place where the\r\nIsraelites passed over with the ark of the covenant, and where\r\nthe blessed Savior was baptized by John. Feeling that it would be\r\ndesecration to moor the boats at a place so sacred, we passed it, and\r\nwith some difficulty found a landing below.\r\n\r\n“My first act was to bathe in the consecrated stream, thanking God,\r\nfirst, for the precious favor of being permitted to visit such a spot;\r\nand, secondly, for his protecting care throughout our perilous passage.\r\nFor a long time after I sat upon the bank, my mind oppressed with awe,\r\nas I mused upon the great and wondrous events which had here occurred.”\r\nIn strange contrast with these passages stands the characteristic\r\nprophecy, “The time is coming--the beginning is come now--when the\r\nwhole worthless list of kings, with all their myrmidons, will be swept\r\nfrom their places, and made to bear a part in the toils and sufferings\r\nof the great human family,” etc., etc.\r\n\r\nI would not willingly make light in others of certain finer\r\nsentiments--veneration, for instance, and conscientiousness--which\r\nNature has perhaps debarred me from overenjoying; nor is it in my mind\r\nto console myself for the privation by debasing the gift in those\r\ngifted with it. But--the but, I fear, will, unlike “if,” be any thing\r\nrather than a great peacemaker in this case--there are feelings which,\r\nwhen strongly felt, when they well from the bottom of the heart, man\r\nconceals in the privacy of his own bosom; and which, if published to\r\nthe world, are apt to remind the world that it has heard of a form\r\nof speech, as well as of argument, ranking under the category of _ad\r\ncaptandum vulgus_.\r\n\r\nAbout a mile beyond Independence Rock we forded the Sweetwater. We had\r\ncrossed the divide between this stream and the Platte, and were now to\r\nascend our fourth river valley, the three others being the Missouri,\r\nthe Big Blue, and the Nebraska. The Canadian voyageurs have translated\r\nthe name Sweetwater from the Indian Pina Pa; but the term is here more\r\napplicable in a metaphorical than in a literal point of view. The water\r\nof the lower bed is rather hard than otherwise, and some travelers\r\nhave detected brackishness in it, yet the banks are free from the\r\nsaline hoar, which deters the thirstiest from touching many streams on\r\nthis line. The Sweetwater, in its calmer course, is a perfect Naiad\r\nof the mountains; presently it will be an Undine hurried by that\r\nterrible Anagké, to which Jove himself must bend his omniscient head,\r\ninto the grisly marital embrace of the gloomy old Platte. Passing\r\npleasant, after the surly ungenial silence of the Shallow River, is the\r\nmerry prattle with which she answers the whisperings of those fickle\r\nflatterers, the winds, before that wedding-day when silence shall\r\nbecome her doom. There is a something in the Sweetwater which appeals\r\nto the feelings of rugged men: even the drivers and the station-keepers\r\nspeak of “her” with a bearish affection.\r\n\r\n[THE DEVIL’S GATE.--RATTLESNAKE HILLS.]\r\n\r\nAfter fording the swift Pina Pa, at that point about seventy feet wide\r\nand deep to the axles, we ran along its valley about six miles, and\r\nreached at 9 15 P.M. the muddy station kept by M. Planté, the usual\r\nCanadian. En route we had passed by the Devil’s Gate, one of the great\r\ncuriosities of this line of travel. It is the beau ideal of a kanyon,\r\nour portal opening upon the threshold of the Rocky Mountains: I can\r\ncompare its form from afar only with the Brêche de Roland in the\r\nPyrenees. The main pass of Aden magnified twenty fold is something\r\nof the same kind, but the simile is too unsavory. The height of the\r\ngorge is from 300 to 400 feet perpendicular, and on the south side\r\nthreatening to fall: it has already done so in parts, as the masses\r\nwhich cumber the stream-bed show. The breadth varies from a minimum\r\nof 40 to a maximum of 105 feet, where the fissure yawns out, and the\r\ntotal length of the cleft is about 250 yards. The material of the\r\nwalls is a gray granite, traversed by dikes of trap; and the rock in\r\nwhich the deep narrow crevasse has been made runs right through the\r\nextreme southern shoulder of a ridge, which bears appropriately enough\r\nthe name of “Rattlesnake Hills.” Through this wild gorge the bright\r\nstream frets and forces her way, singing, unlike Liris, with a feminine\r\nuntaciturnity, that awakes the echoes of the pent-up channel--tumbling\r\nand gurgling, dashing and foaming over the snags, blocks, and boulders,\r\nwhich, fallen from the cliffs above, obstruct the way, and bedewing\r\nthe cedars and bright shrubs which fringe the ragged staples of the\r\ngate. Why she should not have promenaded gently and quietly round,\r\ninstead of through, this grisly barrier of rock, goodness only knows:\r\nhowever, willful and womanlike, she has set her heart upon an apparent\r\nimpossibility, and, as usual with her sex under the circumstances, she\r\nhas had her way. Sermons in stones--I would humbly suggest to my gender.\r\n\r\nProcrastination once more stole my chance; I had reserved myself for\r\nsketching the Devil’s Gate from the southwest, but the station proved\r\ntoo distant to convey a just idea of it. For the truest representation\r\nof the gate, the curious reader will refer to the artistic work of\r\nMr. Frederick Piercy;[93] that published in Captain Marcy’s “List of\r\nItineraries” is like any thing but the Devil’s Gate; even the rough\r\nlithograph in Colonel Frémont’s report is more truthful.\r\n\r\n  [93] Route from Liverpool to Great Salt Lake City.\r\n\r\nWe supped badly as mankind well could at the _cabaret_, where a very\r\nplain young person, and no neat-handed Phyllis withal, supplied us with\r\na cock whose toughness claimed for it the honors of grandpaternity.\r\nChickens and eggs there were none; butcher’s meat, of course, was\r\nunknown, and our hosts ignored the name of tea; their salt was a\r\nkind of saleratus, and their sugar at least half Indian-meal. When\r\nasked about fish, they said that the Sweetwater contained nothing but\r\nsuckers,[94] and that these, though good eating, can not be caught\r\nwith a hook. They are a queer lot, these French Canadians, who have\r\n“located” themselves in the Far West. Travelers who have hunted with\r\nthem speak highly of them as a patient, submissive, and obedient race,\r\ninured to privations, and gifted with the reckless _abandon_--no\r\ndespicable quality in prairie traveling--of the old Gascon adventurer;\r\narmed and ever vigilant, hardy, handy, and hearty children of Nature,\r\ncombining with the sagacity and the instinctive qualities all the\r\nsuperstitions of the Indians; enduring as mountain goats; satisfied\r\nwith a diet of wild meat, happiest when it could be followed by a\r\ncup of strong milkless coffee, a “chasse café” and a “brule-gueule;”\r\ninvariably and contagiously merry; generous as courageous; handsome,\r\nactive, and athletic; sashed, knived, and dressed in buckskin, to the\r\nenvy of every Indian “brave,” and the admiration of every Indian belle,\r\nupon whom, if the adventurer’s heart had not fallen into the snares of\r\nthe more attractive half-breed, he would spend what remained of his\r\n$10 a month, after coffee, alcohol, and tobacco had been extravagantly\r\npaid for, in presents of the gaudiest trash. Such is the voyageur of\r\nbooks: I can only speak of him as I found him, a lazy dog, somewhat shy\r\nand proud, much addicted to loafing and to keeping cabarets, because,\r\nas the old phrase is, the cabarets keep him--in idleness too. Probably\r\nhis good qualities lie below the surface: those who hide a farthing\r\nrush-light under a bushel can hardly expect us, in this railway age, to\r\ntake the trouble of finding it. I will answer, however, for the fact,\r\nthat the bad points are painfully prominent. By virtue of speaking\r\nFrench and knowing something of Canada, I obtained some buffalo robes,\r\nand after a look at the supper, which had all the effect of a copious\r\nfeed, I found a kind of out-house, and smoked till sleep weighed down\r\nmy eyelids.\r\n\r\n  [94] A common fish of the genus Labio, of which there are many\r\n  species--chub, mullet, barbel, horned dace, etc.: they are found in\r\n  almost all the lakes and rivers of North America.\r\n\r\n  _Up the Sweetwater. 19th August._\r\n\r\nWe arose at 6 A.M., before the rest of the household, who, when\r\naroused, “hifered” and sauntered about all _desœuvrés_ till their\r\nwool-gathering wits had returned. The breakfast was a little picture\r\nof the supper; for watered milk, half-baked bread, and unrecognizable\r\nbutter, we paid the somewhat “steep” sum of 75 cents; we privily\r\nhad our grumble, and set out at 7 A.M. to ascend the Valley of the\r\nSweetwater. The river-plain is bounded by two parallel lines of\r\nhills, or rather rocks, running nearly due east and west. Those to\r\nthe north are about a hundred miles in extreme length, and, rising\r\nfrom a great plateau, lie perpendicular to the direction of the real\r\nRocky Mountains toward which they lead: half the course of the Pina\r\nPa subtends their southern base. The Western men know them as the\r\nRattlesnake Hills, while the southern are called after the river. The\r\nformer--a continuation of the ridge in which the Sweetwater has burst\r\na gap--is one of those long lines of lumpy, misshapen, barren rock,\r\nthat suggested to the Canadians for the whole region the name of Les\r\nMontagnes Rocheuses. In parts they are primary, principally syenite and\r\ngranite, with a little gneiss, but they have often so regular a line of\r\ncleavage, perpendicular as well as horizontal, that they may readily be\r\nmistaken for stratifications. The stratified are slaty micaceous shale\r\nand red sandstone, dipping northward, and cut by quartz veins and trap\r\ndikes. The remarkable feature in both formations is the rounding of the\r\nridges or blocks of smooth naked granite: hardly any angles appeared;\r\nthe general effect was, that they had been water-washed immediately\r\nafter birth. The upper portions of this range shelter the bighorn, or\r\nAmerican moufflon, and the cougar,[95] the grizzly bear, and the wolf.\r\nThe southern or Sweetwater range is vulgarly known as the Green-River\r\nMountains: seen from the road, their naked, barren, and sandy flanks\r\nappear within cannon shot, but they are distant seven miles.\r\n\r\n  [95] Locally called the mountain lion. This animal (_F. unicolor_)\r\n  is the largest and fiercest feline of the New World: it is a beast\r\n  of many names--puma, cougar, American lion, panther or painter, etc.\r\n  Its habit of springing upon its prey from trees makes it feared by\r\n  hunters. It was once in the Kaatskills.\r\n\r\n[“ALKALI LAKE.”]\r\n\r\nAfter a four-miles’ drive up the pleasant valley of the little\r\nriver-nymph, to whom the grisly hills formed an effective foil, we saw\r\non the south of the road “Alkali Lake,” another of the Trona formations\r\nwith which we were about to become familiar; in the full glare of\r\nburning day it was undistinguishable as to the surface from the round\r\npond in Hyde Park. Presently ascending a little rise, we were shown for\r\nthe first time a real bit of the far-famed Rocky Mountains, which was\r\nhardly to be distinguished from, except by a shade of solidity, the\r\nfleecy sunlit clouds resting upon the horizon: it was Frémont’s Peak,\r\nthe sharp, snow-clad apex of the Wind River range. Behind us and afar\r\nrose the distant heads of black hills. The valley was charming with its\r\nbright glad green, a tapestry of flowery grass, willow copses where the\r\ngrouse ran in and out, and long lines of aspen, beech, and cotton-wood,\r\nwhile pine and cedar, cypress and scattered evergreens, crept up the\r\ncranks and crannies of the rocks. In the midst of this Firdaus--so\r\nit appeared to us after the horrid unwithering artemisia Jehennum of\r\nlast week--flowed the lovely little stream, transparent as crystal,\r\nand coquettishly changing from side to side in her bed of golden sand.\r\nTo see her tamely submit to being confined within those dwarf earthen\r\ncliffs, you would not have known her to be the same that had made that\r\nterrible breach in the rock-wall below. “Varium et mutabile semper,”\r\netc.: I will not conclude the quotation, but simply remark that the\r\nvoyageurs have called her “She.” And every where, in contrast with the\r\ndeep verdure and the bright flowers of the valley, rose the stern forms\r\nof the frowning rocks, some apparently hanging as though threatening a\r\nfall, others balanced upon the slenderest foundations, all split and\r\nbroken as though earthquake-riven, loosely piled into strange figures,\r\nthe lion couchant, sugar-loaf, tortoise, and armadillo--not a mile, in\r\nfact, was without its totem.\r\n\r\nThe road was good, especially when hardened by frost. We are now in\r\naltitudes where, as in Tibet, parts of the country for long centuries\r\nnever thaw. After passing a singular stone bluff on the left of the\r\nroad, we met a party of discharged soldiers, who were traveling\r\neastward comfortably enough in government wagons drawn by six mules.\r\nNot a man saluted Lieutenant Dana, though he was in uniform, and all\r\nlooked surly as Indians after a scalpless raid. Speeding merrily along,\r\nwe were shown on the right of the road a ranch belonging to a Canadian,\r\na “mighty mean man,” said the driver, “who onst gin me ole mare’s meat\r\nfor b’ar.” We were much shocked by this instance of the awful depravity\r\nof the unregenerate human heart, but our melancholy musings were\r\npresently interrupted by the same youth, who pointed out on the other\r\nside of the path a mass of clay (conglomerate, I presume), called the\r\nDevil’s Post-office. It has been lately washed with rains so copious\r\nthat half the edifice lies at the base of that which is standing. The\r\nstructure is not large: it is highly satisfactory--especially to a man\r\nwho in this life has suffered severely, as the Anglo-Indian ever must\r\nfrom endless official and semi-official correspondence--to remark that\r\nthe London Post-office is about double its size.\r\n\r\n[MISS MOORE AND HER HUSBAND.]\r\n\r\nBeyond the Post-office was another ranch belonging to a Portuguese\r\nnamed Luis Silva, married to an Englishwoman who had deserted the Salt\r\nLake Saints. We “staid a piece” there, but found few inducements to\r\nwaste our time. Moreover, we had heard from afar of an “ole ’ooman,”\r\nan Englishwoman, a Miss Moore--Miss is still used for Mrs. by Western\r\nmen and negroes--celebrated for cleanliness, tidiness, civility, and\r\nhousewifery in general, and we were anxious to get rid of the evil\r\nflavor of Canadians, squaws, and “ladies.”\r\n\r\nAt 11 A.M. we reached “Three Crossings,” when we found the “miss”\r\na stout, active, middle-aged matron, deserving of all the praises\r\nthat had so liberally been bestowed upon her. The little ranch was\r\nneatly swept and garnished, papered and ornamented. The skull of a\r\nfull-grown bighorn hanging over the doorway represented the spoils of\r\na stag of twelve. The table-cloth was clean, so was the cooking, so\r\nwere the children; and I was reminded of Europe by the way in which\r\nshe insisted upon washing my shirt, an operation which, after leaving\r\nthe Missouri, _ça va sans dire_, had fallen to my own lot. In fact,\r\nthis day introduced me to the third novel sensation experienced on the\r\nwestern side of the Atlantic. The first is to feel (practically) that\r\nall men are equal; that you are no man’s superior, and that no man is\r\nyours. The second--this is spoken as an African wanderer--to see one’s\r\nquondam acquaintance, the Kaffir, laying by his grass kilt and coat of\r\ngrease, invest himself in broadcloth, part his wool on one side, shave\r\nwhat pile nature has scattered upon his upper lip, chin, and cheeks\r\nbelow a line drawn from the ear to the mouth-corner after the fashion\r\nof the times when George the Third was king, and call himself, not\r\nSambo, but Mr. Scott. The third was my meeting in the Rocky Mountains\r\nwith this refreshing specimen of that far Old World, where, on the\r\nwhole, society still lies in strata, as originally deposited, distinct,\r\nsharply defined, and rarely displaced, except by some violent upheaval\r\nfrom below, which, however, never succeeds long in producing total\r\ninversion. Miss Moore’s husband, a decent appendage, had transferred\r\nhis belief from the Church of England to the Church of Utah, and the\r\ngood wife, as in duty bound, had followed in his wake whom she was\r\nbound to love, honor, and obey. But when the serpent came and whispered\r\nin Miss Moore’s modest, respectable, one-idea’d ear that the Abrahams\r\nof Great Salt Lake City are mere “sham Abrams”--that, not content with\r\nSarahs, they add to them an unlimited supply of Hagars, then did our\r\nstout Englishwoman’s power of endurance break down never to rise again.\r\n“Not an inch would she budge;” not a step toward Utah Territory would\r\nshe take. She fought pluckily against the impending misfortune, and--_à\r\nquelque chose malheur est bon!_--she succeeded in reducing her husband\r\nto that state which is typified by the wife using certain portions of\r\nthe opposite sex’s wardrobe, and in making him make a good livelihood\r\nas station-master on the wagon-line.\r\n\r\nAfter a copious breakfast, which broke the fast of the four days that\r\nhad dragged on since our civilized refection at Fort Laramie, we spread\r\nour buffalos and water-proofs under the ample eaves of the ranch,\r\nand spent the day in taking time with the sextant--every watch being\r\nwrong--in snoozing, dozing, chatting, smoking, and contemplating the\r\nnovel view. Straight before us rose the Rattlesnake Hills, a nude and\r\ngrim horizon, frowning over the soft and placid scene below, while at\r\ntheir feet flowed the little river--_splendidior vitro_--purling over\r\nits pebbly bed with graceful meanderings through clover prairillons\r\nand garden-spots full of wild currants, strawberries, gooseberries,\r\nand rattlesnakes; while, contrasting with the green River Valley and\r\nthe scorched and tawny rock-wall, patches of sand-hill, raised by the\r\nwinds, here and there cumbered the ground. The variety of the scene was\r\nmuch enhanced by the changeful skies. The fine breeze which had set\r\nin at 8 A.M. had died in the attempt to thread these heat-refracting\r\nridges, and vapory clouds, sublimated by the burning sun, floated\r\nlazily in the empyrean, casting fitful shadows that now intercepted,\r\nthen admitted, a blinding glare upon the mazy stream and its rough\r\ncradle.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we bathed in the shallow bed of the Sweetwater. It is\r\nvain to caution travelers against this imprudence. _Video meliora\r\nproboque_--it is doubtless unwise--but it is also _mera stultitia_\r\nto say to men who have not enjoyed ablutions for a week or ten days,\r\n“If you do take that delicious dip you may possibly catch fever.”\r\n_Deteriora sequor_--bathed. Miss Moore warned us strongly against the\r\nrattlesnakes, and during our walk we carefully observed the Indian\r\nrule, to tread upon the log and not to overstep it. The crotalus, I\r\nneed hardly say, like other snakes, is fond of lurking under the shade\r\nof fallen or felled trunks, and when a heel or a leg is temptingly\r\nset before it, it is not the beast to refuse a bite. Accidents are\r\nvery common, despite all precautions, upon this line, but they seldom,\r\nI believe, prove fatal. The remedies are almost endless: _e. g._,\r\nhartshorn, used externally and drunk in dilution; scarification and\r\nirrumation of the part, preceded, of course, by a ligature between the\r\nlimb and the heart; application of the incised breast of a live fowl or\r\nfrog to the wound; the dried and powdered blood of turtle, of this two\r\npinches to be swallowed and a little dropped upon the place bitten; a\r\nplaster of chewed or washed plantain-leaves--it is cooling enough, but\r\ncan do little more--bound upon the puncture, peppered with a little\r\nfinely-powdered tobacco; pulverized indigo made into a poultice with\r\nwater; cauterization by gunpowder, hot iron, or lunar caustic; cedron,\r\na nut growing on the Isthmus of Panama--of this remedy I heard, _in\r\nloco_, the most wonderful accounts, dying men being restored, as if\r\nby magic, after a bit about the size of a bean had been placed in\r\ntheir mouths. As will be seen below, the land is rich in snakeroots,\r\nbut the superstitious snakestone of Hindostan--which acts, if it\r\ndoes act, as an absorbent of the virus by capillary attraction--is\r\napparently unknown. The favorite remedy now in the United States is\r\nthe “whisky cure,” which, under the form of arrack, combined in the\r\ncase of a scorpion-sting with a poultice of chewed tobacco, was known\r\nfor the last fifty years to the British soldier in India. It has the\r\nadvantage of being a palatable medicine; it must also be taken in large\r\nquantities, a couple of bottles sometimes producing little effect. With\r\nthe lighted end of a cigar applied as moxa to the wound, a _quantum\r\nsufficit_ of ardent spirits, a couple of men to make me walk about\r\nwhen drowsy by the application of a stick, and, above all, with the\r\nserious resolution not to do any thing so mean as to “leap the twig,” I\r\nshould not be afraid of any snake yet created. The only proviso is that\r\nour old enemy must not touch an artery, and that the remedies must be\r\nat hand. Fifteen minutes lost, you are “down among the dead men.” The\r\nhistory of fatal cases always shows some delay.[96]\r\n\r\n  [96] The author of “The Quadroon” (chap. xxxii., etc.) adduces a\r\n  happy instance of a “hero” who, after a delay and an amount of\r\n  exertion which certainly would have cost him his life, was relieved\r\n  by tobacco and cured by the snakeroot (_Polygala Senega_). The\r\n  popular snakeroots quoted by Mr. Bartlett are the Seneca snakeroot\r\n  above alluded to, the black snakeroot (_Cimicifuga racemosa_), and\r\n  the Virginia snakeroot (_Aristolochia serpentaria_).\r\n\r\n[A HUBBUB.--“YES, SURR!”]\r\n\r\nWe supped in the evening merrily. It was the best coffee we had tasted\r\nsince leaving New Orleans; the cream was excellent, so was the cheese.\r\nBut an antelope had unfortunately been brought in; we had insisted upon\r\na fry of newly-killed flesh, which was repeated in the morning, and we\r\nhad bitterly to regret it. While I was amusing myself by attempting to\r\nobserve an immersion of Jupiter’s satellites with a notable failure in\r\nthe shape of that snare and delusion, a portable telescope, suddenly\r\nthere arose a terrible hubbub. For a moment it was believed that\r\nthe crotalus horridus had been taking liberties with one of Miss\r\nMoore’s progeny. The seat of pain, however, soon removed the alarming\r\nsuspicion, and--the rattlesnake seldom does damage at night--we soon\r\ncame to the conclusion that the dear little fellow who boo-hoo’d for\r\nforty had been bitten by a musqueto somewhat bigger than its fellows.\r\nThe poor mother soon was restored to her habits of happiness and hard\r\nlabor. Not contented with supporting her own family, she was doing\r\nsupererogation by feeding a little rat-eyed, snub-nosed, shark-mouthed\r\nhalf-breed girl, who was, I believe, in the market as a “chattel.” Mrs.\r\nDana pointed out to me one sign of demoralization on the part of Miss\r\nMoore. It was so microscopic that only a woman’s acute eye could detect\r\nit. Miss Moore was teaching her children to say “Yes, surr!” to every\r\ndriver.\r\n\r\n  _To the Foot of South Pass. 19th August._\r\n\r\nWith renewed spirit, despite a somewhat hard struggle with the\r\nmusquetoes, we set out at the respectable hour of 5 45 A.M. We had\r\nbreakfasted comfortably, and an interesting country lay before us.\r\nThe mules seemed to share in our gayety. Despite a long ringing,\r\nthe amiable animals kicked and bit, bucked and backed, till their\r\nrecalcitrances had almost deposited us in the first ford of the\r\nSweetwater. For this, however, we were amply consoled by the greater\r\nmisfortunes of our consort, the official wagon. After long luxuriating\r\nin the pick of the teams, they were to-day so thoroughly badly “muled”\r\nthat they were compelled to apply for our assistance.\r\n\r\nWe forded the river twice within fifty yards, and we recognized with\r\nsensible pleasure a homely-looking magpie (_Pica Hudsonica_), and a\r\nrattlesnake, not inappropriately, considering where we were, crossed\r\nthe road. Our path lay between two rocky ridges, which gradually closed\r\ninward, forming a regular kanyon, quite shutting out the view. On both\r\nsides white and micaceous granite towered to the height of 300 or 400\r\nfeet, terminating in jagged and pointed peaks, whose partial disruption\r\ncovered the angle at their base. Arrived at Ford No. 5, we began an\r\nascent, and reaching the summit, halted to enjoy the fine back view of\r\nthe split and crevassed mountains.\r\n\r\nA waterless and grassless track of fifteen to sixteen miles led us to\r\na well-known place--the Ice Springs--of which, somewhat unnecessarily,\r\na marvel is made. The ground, which lies on the right of the road, is\r\na long and swampy trough between two waves of land which permit the\r\nhumidity to drain down, and the grass is discolored, suggesting the\r\npresence of alkali. After digging about two feet, ice is found in small\r\nfragments. Its presence, even in the hottest seasons, may be readily\r\naccounted for by the fact that hereabouts water will freeze in a tent\r\nduring July, and by the depth to which the wintry frost extends. Upon\r\nthe same principle, snow gathering in mountain ravines and hollows long\r\noutlasts the shallower deposits. A little beyond Ice Springs, on the\r\nopposite side of, and about a quarter of a mile distant from the road,\r\nlie the Warm Springs, one of the many alkaline pans which lie scattered\r\nover the face of the country. From the road nothing is to be seen but a\r\ndeep cunette full of percolated water.\r\n\r\nBeyond the Warm Springs lay a hopeless-looking land, a vast slope,\r\nbarren and desolate as Nature could well make it. The loose sands and\r\nthe granite masses of the valley had disappeared; the surface was a\r\nthin coat of hard gravelly soil. Some mosses, a scanty yellow grass,\r\nand the dark gray artemisia, now stunted and shrunk, were sparsely\r\nscattered about. It had already begun to give way before an even\r\nhardier creation, the rabbit-bush and the greasewood. The former,\r\nwhich seems to thrive under the wintry snow, is a favorite food with\r\nhares, which abound in this region; the latter (_Obione_, or _Atriplex\r\ncanescens_, the chamizo of the Mexicans) derives its name from the\r\noleaginous matter abundant in its wood, and is always a sign of a\r\npoor and sterile soil. Avoiding a steep descent by a shorter road,\r\ncalled “Landers’ Cut-off,” we again came upon the Sweetwater, which\r\nwas here somewhat broader than below, and lighted upon good grass\r\nand underbrush, willow copses, and a fair halting-place. At Ford No.\r\n6--three followed one another in rapid succession--we found the cattle\r\nof a traveling trader scattered over the pasture-grounds, He proved to\r\nbe an Italian driven from the low country by a band of Sioux, who had\r\nslain his Shoshonee wife, and at one time had thought of adding his\r\nscalp to his squaw’s. After Ford No. 8, we came upon a camping-ground,\r\nusually called in guide-books “River Bank and Stream.” The Sweetwater\r\nis here twenty-five feet wide. About three miles beyond it lay\r\nthe “Foot of Ridge Station,” near a willowy creek, called from its\r\nprincipal inhabitants the Muskrat.[97] The ridge from which it derives\r\nits name is a band of stone that will cross the road during to-morrow’s\r\nascent. Being a frontier place, it is a favorite camping-ground with\r\nIndians. To-day a war party of Sioux rode in, _en route_ to provide\r\nthemselves with a few Shoshonee scalps.\r\n\r\n  [97] _Fiber zibeticus_, a beaver-like animal that inhabits the banks\r\n  of ponds and streams: it has a strong musky odor in summer only, and\r\n  is greedily eaten by the Indians.\r\n\r\n[TEMPERATURE.]\r\n\r\nWe made a decided rise to-day, and stood at least 6000 feet above the\r\nlevel of the sea. The altitude of St. Louis being in round numbers\r\n500 feet, and reckoning the diminution of temperature at 1° F. = 100\r\nyards, we are already 19° to 20° F. colder than before. The severity\r\nof the atmosphere and the rapid evaporation from the earth cause an\r\nincrease of frigidity, to which the salts and nitrates upon the surface\r\nof the soil, by absorbing the hydrogen of the atmosphere--as is shown\r\nby the dampness of the ground and the absence of dust around the\r\nSaleratus Lakes--greatly add. Another remark made by every traveler\r\nin these regions is the marked influence upon the temperature caused\r\nby the presence and the absence of the sun. The day will be sultry\r\nand oppressive, and a fire will be required at night. In the morning,\r\nabout 11 A.M., the thermometer showed 80° Fahrenheit; at 4 P.M., the\r\nsky being clouded over, it fell 25°; before dawn, affected by the cold\r\nnorth wind from the snows about the Pass, it stood at 40°.\r\n\r\n[FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED.]\r\n\r\nThe lowering firmament threatened rain, of which, however, the thirsty\r\nland was disappointed. Moreover, all were agreed that snow was to\r\nbe expected in another fortnight, if not sooner. Glacial storms\r\noccasionally occur in July and August, so that in some years the\r\nland may be said to have no summer. In winter the sharpness of the\r\ncold is such that it can be kept out only by clothes of the closest\r\ntexture; the mountain-men, like the Esquimaux, prefer to clothe\r\nthemselves cap-a-piè in the prepared skins of animals. We were all\r\nanimated with a nervous desire for travel, but there was the rub. The\r\nstation-master declared that he had no driver, no authority to forward\r\ntwo wagonsful, and no cattle; consequently, that the last comers must\r\nbe last served, and wait patiently at Rocky Ridge till they could be\r\nsent on. They would find antelopes in plenty, perhaps a grizzly, and\r\nplenty of plover, crows, and delicate little ground-squirrels[98] by\r\nthe burrowful, to “keep their hands in.” We being the first comers,\r\na title to preference rarely disputed in this law-and-rule-abiding\r\nland, prudently held ourselves aloof. The Judiciary, however, was\r\nsorely “exercised.” Being a “professor,” that is, a serious person, he\r\ncould not relieve his mind by certain little _moyens_ which naturally\r\noccurred to the rest of the party. Many and protracted were the powwows\r\nthat took place on this momentous occasion. Sometimes our quondam\r\ncompanions--we now looked upon them as friends lost to us--would\r\nmysteriously disappear as though the earth had opened and swallowed\r\nthem, and presently they would return with woe-begone step and the\r\nwrinkled brow of care, simulating an ease which they were far from\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\n  [98] I had no opportunity of observing this clean, pretty, and\r\n  vivacious little animal, whose chirruping resembles that of\r\n  a bird; but it appeared to be quite a different species from\r\n  the common striped and spotted prairie-squirrel (_Spermophilus\r\n  tredecimlineatus_), or the chipmonk or chipmuk (_S. striatus_).\r\n\r\nThe station rather added to than took from our discomfort: it was a\r\nterrible unclean hole; milk was not procurable within thirty-five\r\nmiles; one of the officials was suffering sorely from a stomach-ache;\r\nthere was no sugar, and the cooking was atrocious. With a stray\r\ntitle-pageless volume of some natural history of America, and another\r\nof agricultural reports--in those days, before reform came, these\r\nscientific and highly elaborate compositions, neatly printed and\r\nexpensively got up at the public expense, were apparently distributed\r\nto every ranch and station in the line of road--I worked through the\r\nlong and tedious afternoon. We were not sorry when the night came,\r\nbut then the floor was knobby, the musquetoes seemed rather to enjoy\r\nthe cold, and the banks swarmed with “chinches.”[99] The coyotes and\r\nwolves made night vocal with their choruses, and had nearly caused an\r\naccident. One of the station-men arose, and, having a bone to pick with\r\nthe animals for having robbed his beef-barrel, cocked his revolver, and\r\nwas upon the point of firing, when the object aimed at started up and\r\ncried out in the nick of time that he was a federal marshal, not a wolf.\r\n\r\n  [99] The chinch or chints is the Spanish _chinche_--the popular word\r\n  for the _Cimex lectularius_ in the Southern States. In other parts of\r\n  the United States the English bug is called a bed-bug: without the\r\n  prefix it is applied to beetles and a variety of Coleopters, as the\r\n  May-bug, June-bug, golden-bug, etc.\r\n\r\n  _To the South Pass. August 20th._\r\n\r\nWe rose with the daybreak; we did not start till nearly 8 A.M., the\r\ninterim having been consumed by the tenants of our late consort in a\r\nvain palaver. We bade adieu to them and mounted at last, loudly pitying\r\ntheir miseries as they disappeared from our ken. But the driver bade\r\nus reserve our sympathy and humane expressions for a more fitting\r\noccasion, and declared--it was probably a little effort of his own\r\nimagination--that those faithless friends had spent all their spare\r\ntime in persuading him to take them on and to leave us behind. I, for\r\none, will never believe that any thing of the kind had been attempted;\r\na man must be created with a total absence of the bowels of compassion\r\nwho would leave a woman and a young child for days together at the foot\r\nof Ridge Station.\r\n\r\n[WILLOW CREEK.--SOUTH-PASS CITY.]\r\n\r\nThe road at once struck away from the Sweetwater, winding up and\r\ndown rugged hills and broken hollows. From Fort Laramie the land is\r\nall a sandy and hilly desert where one can easily starve, but here\r\nit shows its worst features. During a steep descent a mule fell,\r\nand was not made to regain its footing without difficulty. Signs of\r\nwolves, coyotes, and badgers were abundant, and the _coqs de prairie_\r\n(sage-chickens), still young and toothsome at this season, were at\r\nno pains to get out of shot. After about five miles we passed by\r\n“Three Lakes,” dirty little ponds north of the road, two near it and\r\none distant, all about a quarter of a mile apart, and said by those\r\nfond of tasting strange things to have somewhat the flavor, as they\r\ncertainly have the semblance, of soapsuds. Beyond this point we crossed\r\na number of influents of the pretty Sweetwater, some dry, others full:\r\nthe most interesting was Strawberry Creek: it supplies plenty of the\r\nfragrant wild fruit, and white and red willows fringe the bed as long\r\nas it retains its individuality. To the north a mass of purple nimbus\r\nobscured the mountains--on Frémont’s Peak it is said always to rain\r\nor snow--and left no visible line between earth and sky. Quaking-Asp\r\nCreek was bone dry. At MacAchran’s Branch of the Sweetwater we found,\r\npitched upon a sward near a willow copse, a Provençal Frenchman--by\r\nwhat “hasard que les sceptiques appellent l’homme d’affaires du bon\r\nDieu” did he come here?--who begged us to stop and give him the news,\r\nespecially about the Indians: we could say little that was reassuring.\r\nAnother spell of rough, steep ground placed us at Willow Creek, a\r\npretty little prairillon, with verdure, water, and an abundance of the\r\nlarger vegetation, upon which our eyes, long accustomed to artemisia\r\nand rabbit-bush, dwelt with a compound sense of surprise and pleasure.\r\nIn a well-built ranch at this place of plenty were two Canadian\r\ntraders, apparently settled for life; they supplied us, as we found it\r\nnecessary to “liquor up,” with a whisky which did not poison us, and\r\nthat is about all that I can say for it. At Ford No. 9, we bade adieu\r\nto the Sweetwater with that natural regret which one feels when losing\r\nsight of the only pretty face and pleasant person in the neighborhood;\r\nand we heard with a melancholy satisfaction the driver’s tribute to\r\ndeparting worth, viz., that its upper course is the “healthiest water\r\nin the world.” Near this spot, since my departure, has been founded\r\n“South-Pass City,” one of the many mushroom growths which the presence\r\nof gold in the Rocky Mountains has caused to spring up.\r\n\r\nTen miles beyond Ford No. 9, hilly miles, ending in a long champaign\r\nhaving some of the characteristics of a rolling prairie, with scatters\r\nof white, rose, and smoky quartz, granite, hornblende, porphyry,\r\nmarble-like lime, sandstone, and mica slate--the two latter cropping\r\nout of the ground and forming rocky ridges--led us to the South Pass,\r\nthe great _Wassersheide_ between the Atlantic and the Pacific, and the\r\nfrontier points between the territory of Nebraska and the State of\r\nOregon. From the mouth of the Sweetwater, about 120 miles, we have been\r\nrising so gradually, almost imperceptibly, that now we unexpectedly\r\nfind ourselves upon the summit. The distance from Fort Laramie is 320\r\nmiles, from St. Louis 1580, and from the mouth of the Oregon about\r\n1400: it is therefore nearly midway between the Mississippi and the\r\nPacific. The dimensions of this memorial spot are 7490 feet above\r\nsea-level, and 20 miles in breadth. The last part of the ascent is\r\nso gentle that it is difficult to distinguish the exact point where\r\nthe versant lies: a stony band crossing the road on the ridge of the\r\ntable-land is pointed out as the place, and the position has been fixed\r\nat N. lat. 48° 19′, and W. long. 108° 40′.[100] The northern limit is\r\nthe noble chain of Les Montagnes Rocheuses, which goes by the name of\r\nthe Wind River; the southern is called Table Mountain, an insignificant\r\nmass of low hills.\r\n\r\n  [100] Some guide-books place the water-shed between two small hills,\r\n  the “Twin Peaks,” about fifty or sixty feet high; the road, however,\r\n  no longer passes between them.\r\n\r\nA pass it is not: it has some of the features of Thermopylæ or the\r\nGorge of Killiecrankie; of the European St. Bernard or Simplon; of\r\nthe Alleghany Passes or of the Mexican _Barrancas_. It is not, as\r\nit sounds, a ghaut between lofty mountains, or, as the traveler may\r\nexpect, a giant gateway, opening through Cyclopean walls of beetling\r\nrocks that rise in forbidding grandeur as he passes onward to the\r\nWestern continent. And yet the word “Pass” has its significancy. In\r\nthat New World where Nature has worked upon the largest scale, where\r\nevery feature of scenery, river and lake, swamp and forest, prairie and\r\nmountain, dwarf their congeners in the old hemisphere, this majestic\r\nlevel-topped bluff, the highest steppe of the continent, upon whose\r\niron surface there is space enough for the armies of the globe to march\r\nover, is the grandest and the most appropriate of avenues.\r\n\r\nA water-shed is always exciting to the traveler. What shall I say\r\nof this, where, on the topmost point of American travel, you drink\r\nwithin a hundred yards of the waters of the Atlantic and the Pacific\r\nOceans--that divides the “doorways of the west wind” from the “portals\r\nof the sunrise?” On the other side of yon throne of storms, within\r\nsight, did not the Sierra interpose, lie separated by a trivial space\r\nthe fountain-heads that give birth to the noblest rivers of the\r\ncontinent, the Columbia, the Colorado, and the Yellow Stone, which\r\nis to the Missouri what the Missouri is to the Mississippi, whence\r\nthe waters trend to four opposite directions: the Wind River to the\r\nnortheast; to the southeast the Sweetwater and the Platte; the various\r\nbranches of the Snake River to the northeast; and to the southwest the\r\nGreen River, that finds its way into the Californian Gulf.[101] It\r\nis a suggestive spot, this “divortia aquarum:” it compels Memory to\r\nrevive past scenes before plunging into the mysterious “Lands of the\r\nHereafter,” which lie before and beneath the feet. The Great Ferry,\r\nwhich steam has now bridged, the palisaded banks of the Hudson, the\r\nsoft and sunny scenery of the Ohio, and the kingly course of the\r\nUpper Mississippi, the terrible beauty of Niagara, and the marvels of\r\nthat chain of inland seas which winds its watery way from Ontario to\r\nSuperior; the rich pasture-lands of the North, the plantations of the\r\nsemi-tropical South, and the broad corn-fields of the West; finally,\r\nthe vast meadow-land and the gloomy desert-waste of sage and saleratus,\r\nof clay and _mauvaise terre_, of red _butte_ and tawny rock, all pass\r\nbefore the mind in rapid array ere they are thrust into oblivion by the\r\nexcitement of a new departure.\r\n\r\n  [101] As early as A.D. 1772 (Description of the Province of Carolana,\r\n  etc., etc., by Daniel Cox) it was suggested that there was a line of\r\n  water communication by means of the “northern branch of the Great\r\n  Yellow River, by the natives called the River of the Massorites”\r\n  (Missouri River), and a branch of the Columbia River, which, however,\r\n  was erroneously supposed to disembogue through the Great Salt Lake\r\n  into the Pacific. The idea has been revived in the present day. Some\r\n  assert that the upper waters of the Yellow Stone, which approach\r\n  within three hundred miles of Great Salt Lake City, are three\r\n  feet deep, and therefore navigable for flat-bottomed boats during\r\n  the annual inundation. Others believe that, as in the case of the\r\n  Platte, shallowness would be an insuperable obstacle, except for\r\n  one or two months. This point will doubtless be settled by Captain\r\n  W. F. Raynolds, of the United States Topographical Engineers, who,\r\n  accompanied by Colonel J. Bridger, was, at the time of my visit to\r\n  Great Salt Lake City, exploring the Valley of the Yellow Stone.\r\n\r\n[THE SOUTH PASS.]\r\n\r\nBut we have not yet reached our destination, which is two miles below\r\nthe South Pass. Pacific Springs is our station; it lies a little down\r\nthe hill, and we can sight it from the road. The springs are a pond of\r\npure, hard, and very cold water, surrounded by a strip of shaking bog,\r\nwhich must be boarded over before it will bear a man. The hut would be\r\na right melancholy abode were it not for the wooded ground on one hand,\r\nand the glorious snow-peaks on the other side of the “Pass.” We reached\r\nPacific Springs at 3 P.M., and dined without delay, the material being\r\nbouilli and potatoes--unusual luxuries. About an hour afterward the\r\nwest wind, here almost invariable, brought up a shower of rain, and\r\nswept a vast veil over the forms of the Wind-River Mountains. Toward\r\nsunset it cleared away, and the departing luminary poured a flood of\r\ngold upon the majestic pile--I have seldom seen a view more beautiful.\r\n\r\nFrom the south, the barren rolling table-land that forms the Pass\r\ntrends northward till it sinks apparently below a ridge of offsets from\r\nthe main body, black with timber--cedar, cypress, fir, and balsam pine.\r\nThe hand of Nature has marked, as though by line and level, the place\r\nwhere vegetation shall go and no farther. Below the waist the mountains\r\nare robed in evergreens; above it, to the shoulders, they would be\r\nentirely bare but for the atmosphere, which has thrown a thin veil\r\nof light blue over their tawny gray, while their majestic heads are\r\ncovered with ice and snow, or are hidden from sight by thunder-cloud\r\nor the morning mist. From the south, on clear days, the cold and\r\nglittering radiance may be seen at a distance of a hundred miles. The\r\nmonarch of these mountains is “Frémont’s Peak;” its height is laid down\r\nat 13,570 feet above sea level; and second to it is a hoary cone called\r\nby the station-people Snowy Peak.\r\n\r\nThat evening the Wind-River Mountains appeared in marvelous majesty.\r\nThe huge purple hangings of rain-cloud in the northern sky set off\r\ntheir huge proportions, and gave prominence, as in a stereoscope, to\r\ntheir gigantic forms, and their upper heights, hoar with the frosts\r\nof ages. The mellow radiance of the setting sun diffused a charming\r\nsoftness over their more rugged features, defining the folds and\r\nravines with a distinctness which deceived every idea of distance. And\r\nas the light sank behind the far western horizon, it traveled slowly up\r\nthe mountain side, till, reaching the summit, it mingled its splendors\r\nwith the snow--flashing and flickering for a few brief moments, then\r\nwasting them in the dark depths of the upper air. Nor was the scene\r\nless lovely in the morning hour, as the first effulgence of day fell\r\nupon the masses of dew-cloud--at this time mist always settles upon\r\ntheir brows--lit up the peaks, which gleamed like silver, and poured\r\nits streams of light and warmth over the broad skirts reposing upon the\r\nplain.\r\n\r\nThis unknown region was explored in August, 1842, by Colonel, then\r\nBrevet Captain, J. C. Frémont, of the United States Topographical\r\nEngineers; and his eloquent descriptions of the magnificent scenery\r\nthat rewarded his energy and enterprise prove how easily men write\r\nwell when they have a great subject to write upon. The concourse\r\nof small green tarns, rushing waters, and lofty cascades, with the\r\ngigantic disorder of enormous masses, the savage sublimity of the naked\r\nrock, broken, jagged cones, slender minarets, needles, and columns,\r\nand serrated walls, 2000 to 3000 feet high, all naked and destitute\r\nof vegetable earth; the vertical precipices, chasms, and fissures,\r\ninsecure icy passages, long moraines, and sloping glaciers--which had\r\nnearly proved fatal to some of the party; the stern recesses, shutting\r\nout from the world dells and ravines of exquisite beauty, smoothly\r\ncarpeted with soft grass, kept green and fresh by the moisture of the\r\natmosphere, and sown with gay groups of brilliant flowers, of which\r\nyellow was the predominant color: all this glory and grandeur seems\r\nto be placed like a picture before our eyes. The reader enjoys, like\r\nthe explorer, the fragrant odor of the pines, and the pleasure of\r\nbreathing, in the bright, clear morning, that “mountain air which\r\nmakes a constant theme of the hunter’s praise,” and which causes\r\nman to feel as if he had been inhaling some exhilarating gas. We\r\nsympathize with his joy in having hit upon “such a beautiful entrance\r\nto the mountains,” in his sorrow, caused by accidents to barometer\r\nand thermometer, and in the honest pride with which, fixing a ramrod\r\nin the crevice of “an unstable and precarious slab, which it seemed a\r\nbreath would hurl into the abyss below,” he unfurled the Stars and the\r\nStripes, to wave in the breeze where flag never waved before--over the\r\ntopmost crest of the Rocky Mountains. And every driver upon the road\r\nnow can tell how, in the profound silence and terrible stillness and\r\nsolitude that affect the mind as the great features of the scene, while\r\nsitting on a rock at the very summit, where the silence was absolute,\r\nunbroken by any sound, and the stillness and solitude were completest,\r\na solitary “humble-bee”[102] winging through the black-blue air his\r\nflight from the eastern valley, alit upon the knee of one of the men,\r\nand, helas! “found a grave in the leaves of the large book, among the\r\nflowers collected on the way.”\r\n\r\n  [102] A species of _bromus_ or _bombus_. In the United States, as\r\n  in England, the word is often pronounced bumble-bee. Johnson says\r\n  we call a bee an humble bee that wants a sting; so the States call\r\n  black cattle without horns “humble cows.” It is the general belief of\r\n  the mountaineers that the bee, the partridge, the plantain, and the\r\n  “Jamestown weed” follow the footsteps of the white pioneers westward.\r\n\r\n[GOLD.--GAME.--MUSQUETOES.--A “SMUDGE.”]\r\n\r\nThe Wind-River Range has other qualities than mere formal beauty to\r\nrecommend it. At Horseshoe Creek I was shown a quill full of large\r\ngold-grains from a new digging. Probably all the primitive masses of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains will be found to contain the precious metal. The\r\nwooded heights are said to be a very paradise of sport, full of elk and\r\nevery kind of deer; pumas; bears, brown[103] as well as grizzly; the\r\nwolverine;[104] in parts the mountain buffalo--briefly, all the noble\r\ngame of the Continent. The Indian tribes, Shoshonees and Blackfeet, are\r\nnot deadly to whites. Washiki, the chief of the former, had, during the\r\ntime of our visit, retired to hilly ground, about forty miles north of\r\nthe Foot of Ridge Station. This chief--a fine, manly fellow, equal in\r\npoint of physical strength to the higher race--had been a firm friend,\r\nfrom the beginning, to emigrant and settler; but he was complaining,\r\naccording to the road officials, that the small amount of inducement\r\nprevented his affording good conduct any longer--that he must rob, like\r\nthe rest of the tribe. Game, indeed, is not unfrequently found near\r\nthe Pacific Springs; they are visited, later in the year, by swans,\r\ngeese, and flights of ducks. At this season they seem principally to\r\nattract coyotes--five mules have lately been worried by the little\r\nvillains--huge cranes, chicken-hawks, a large species of trochilus, and\r\nclouds of musquetoes, which neither the altitude, the cold, nor the\r\neternal wind-storm that howls through the Pass can drive from their\r\nfavorite breeding-bed. Near nightfall a flock of wild geese passed\r\nover us, audibly threatening an early winter. We were obliged, before\r\nresting, to insist upon a smudge,[105] without which fumigation sleep\r\nwould have been impossible.\r\n\r\n  [103] Some authorities doubt that the European brown bear is found in\r\n  America.\r\n\r\n  [104] The wolverine (_Gulo luscus_), carcajou, or glutton, extends\r\n  throughout Utah Territory: its carnivorous propensities render it an\r\n  object of peculiar hatred to fur-hunters. The first name is loosely\r\n  used in the States: the people of Michigan are called Wolverines,\r\n  from the large number of _mischievous prairie wolves_ found there\r\n  (Bartlett).\r\n\r\n  [105] This old North of England word is used in the West for a\r\n  heap of green bush or other damp combustibles, placed inside or to\r\n  windward of a house or tent, and partially lighted, so as to produce\r\n  a thick, pungent steam.\r\n\r\nThe shanty was perhaps a trifle more uncomfortable than the average;\r\nour only seat was a kind of trestled plank, which suggested a\r\ncertain obsolete military punishment called riding on a rail. The\r\nstation-master was a _bon enfant_; but his help, a Mormon lad, still\r\nin his teens, had been trained to go in a “sorter” jibbing and\r\nsomewhat uncomfortable “argufying,” “highfalutin’” way. He had the\r\nfuror for fire-arms that characterizes the ingenuous youth of Great\r\nSalt Lake City, and his old rattletrap of a revolver, which always\r\nreposed by his side at night, was as dangerous to his friends as to\r\nhimself. His vernacular was peculiar; like Mr. Boatswain Chucks (Mr.\r\nD----s), he could begin a sentence with polished and elaborate diction,\r\nbut it always ended, like the wicked, badly. He described himself,\r\nfor instance, as having lately been “slightly inebriated;” but the\r\neuphuistic periphrasis concluded with an asseveration that he would be\r\n“Gord domned” if he did it again.\r\n\r\nThe night was, like the day, loud and windy, the log hut being somewhat\r\ncrannied and creviced, and the door had a porcelain handle, and a\r\nshocking bad fit--a characteristic combination. We had some trouble to\r\nkeep ourselves warm. At sunrise the thermometer showed 35° Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\n  _To Green River. August 21st._\r\n\r\nWe rose early, despite the cold, to enjoy once more the lovely aspect\r\nof the Wind-River Mountains, upon whose walls of snow the rays of\r\nthe unrisen sun broke with a splendid effect; breakfasted, and found\r\nourselves _en route_ at 8 A.M. The day did not begin well: Mrs. Dana\r\nwas suffering severely from fatigue, and the rapid transitions from\r\nheat to cold; Miss May, poor child! was but little better, and the team\r\nwas re-enforced by an extra mule returning to its proper station: this\r\nfour-footed Xantippe caused us, without speaking of the dust from her\r\nhoofs, an immensity of trouble.\r\n\r\nAt the Pacific Creek, two miles below the springs, we began the\r\ndescent of the Western water-shed, and the increase of temperature\r\nsoon suggested a lower level. We were at once convinced that those who\r\nexpect any change for the better on the counterslope of the mountains\r\nlabor under a vulgar error. The land was desolate, a red waste, dotted\r\nwith sage and greasebush, and in places pitted with large rain-drops.\r\nBut, looking backward, we could admire the Sweetwater’s Gap heading far\r\naway, and the glorious pile of mountains which, disposed in crescent\r\nshape, curtained the horizon; their southern and western bases wanted,\r\nhowever, one of the principal charms of the upper view: the snow\r\nhad well-nigh been melted off. Yet, according to the explorer, they\r\nsupply within the space of a few miles the Green River with a number\r\nof tributaries, which are all called the New Forks. We kept them in\r\nsight till they mingled with the upper air like immense masses of\r\nthunder-cloud gathering for a storm.\r\n\r\n[THE GLISTENING GRAVEL WATER.]\r\n\r\nFrom Pacific Creek the road is not bad, but at this season the emigrant\r\nparties are sorely tried by drought, and when water is found it is\r\noften fetid or brackish. After seventeen miles we passed the junction\r\nof the Great Salt Lake and Fort Hall roads. Near Little Sandy Creek--a\r\nfeeder of its larger namesake--which after rains is about 2·5 feet\r\ndeep, we found nothing but sand, caked clay, sage, thistles, and the\r\nscattered fragments of camp-fires, with large ravens picking at the\r\nbleaching skeletons, and other indications of a halting-ground, an eddy\r\nin the great current of mankind, which, ceaseless as the Gulf Stream,\r\never courses from east to west. After a long stage of twenty-nine miles\r\nwe made Big Sandy Creek, an important influent of the Green River; the\r\nstream, then shrunken, was in breadth not less than five rods, each =\r\n16·5 feet, running with a clear, swift current through a pretty little\r\nprairillon, bright with the blue lupine, the delicate pink malvacea,\r\nthe golden helianthus, purple aster acting daisy, the white mountain\r\nheath, and the green Asclepias tuberosa,[106] a weed common throughout\r\nUtah Territory. The Indians, in their picturesque way, term this stream\r\nWágáhongopá, or the Glistening Gravel Water.[107] We halted for an hour\r\nto rest and dine; the people of the station, man and wife, the latter\r\nvery young, were both English, and of course Mormons; they had but\r\nlately become tenants of the ranch, but already they were thinking, as\r\nthe Old Country people will, of making their surroundings “nice and\r\ntidy.”\r\n\r\n  [106] Locally called milkweed. The whites use the silky cotton of\r\n  the pods, as in Arabia, for bed-stuffings, and the Sioux Indians\r\n  of the Upper Platte boil and eat the young pods with their buffalo\r\n  flesh. Colonel Frémont asserts that he never saw this plant without\r\n  remarking “on the flower a large butterfly, so nearly resembling it\r\n  in color as to be distinguishable at a little distance only by the\r\n  motion of its wings.”\r\n\r\n  [107] Similarly the Snake River, an eastern influent of the Colorado,\r\n  is called Yampa Pa, or Sweet Root (_Anethum graveolens_) Water.\r\n\r\nBeyond the Glistening Gravel Water lies a _mauvaise terre_, sometimes\r\ncalled the First Desert, and upon the old road water is not found in\r\nthe dry season within forty-nine miles--a terrible _jornada_[108] for\r\nladen wagons with tired cattle. We prepared for drought by replenishing\r\nall our canteens--one of them especially, a tin flask, covered outside\r\nwith thick cloth, kept the fluid deliciously cold--and we amused\r\nourselves by the pleasant prospect of seeing wild mules taught to bear\r\nharness. The tricks of equine viciousness and asinine obstinacy played\r\nby the mongrels were so distinct, that we had no pains in determining\r\nwhat was inherited from the father and what from the other side of the\r\nhouse. Before they could be hitched up they were severally hustled into\r\nsomething like a parallel line with the pole, and were then forced\r\ninto their places by a rope attached to the fore wheel, and hauled at\r\nthe other end by two or three men. Each of these pleasant animals had a\r\nbell: it is sure, unless corraled, to run away, and at night sound is\r\nnecessary to guide the pursuer. At last, being “all aboord,” we made\r\na start, dashed over the Big Sandy, charged the high stiff bank with\r\nan impetus that might have carried us up an otter-slide or a Montagne\r\nRusse, and took the right side of the valley, leaving the stream at\r\nsome distance.\r\n\r\n  [108] The Spanish-Mexican term for a day’s march. It is generally\r\n  applied to a waterless march, _e. g._, “Jornada del Muerto” in New\r\n  Mexico, which, like some in the Sahara, measures ninety miles across.\r\n\r\nRain-clouds appeared from the direction of the hills: apparently they\r\nhad many centres, as the distant sheet was rent into a succession of\r\ndistinct streamers. A few drops fell upon us as we advanced. Then\r\nthe fiery sun “ate up” the clouds, or raised them so high that they\r\nbecame playthings in the hands of the strong and steady western gale.\r\nThe thermometer showed 95° in the carriage, and 111° exposed to the\r\nreflected heat upon the black leather cushions. It was observable,\r\nhowever, that the sensation was not what might have been expected from\r\nthe height of the mercury, and perspiration was unknown except during\r\nsevere exercise; this proves the purity and salubrity of the air.\r\nIn St. Jo and New Orleans the effect would have been that of India\r\nor of a Turkish steam-bath. The heat, however, brought with it one\r\nevil--a green-headed horsefly, that stung like a wasp, and from which\r\ncattle must be protected with a coating of grease and tar. Whenever\r\nwind blew, tourbillons of dust coursed over the different parts of\r\nthe plain, showing a highly electrical state of the atmosphere. When\r\nthe air was unmoved the mirage was perfect as the sarab in Sindh or\r\nSouthern Persia; earth and air were both so dry that the refraction\r\nof the sunbeams elevated the objects acted upon more than I had ever\r\nseen before. A sea lay constantly before our eyes, receding of course\r\nas we advanced, but in all other points a complete _lusus naturæ_.\r\nThe color of the water was a dull cool sky-blue, not white, as the\r\n“looming” generally is; the broad expanse had none of that tremulous\r\nupward motion which is its general concomitant; it lay placid, still,\r\nand perfectly reflecting in its azure depths--here and there broken by\r\nprojecting capes and bluff headlands--the forms of the higher grounds\r\nbordering the horizon.\r\n\r\nAfter twelve miles’ driving we passed through a depression called\r\nSimpson’s Hollow, and somewhat celebrated in local story. Two\r\nsemicircles of black still charred the ground; on a cursory view they\r\nmight have been mistaken for burnt-out lignite. Here, in 1857, the\r\nMormons fell upon a corraled train of twenty-three wagons, laden with\r\nprovisions and other necessaries for the federal troops, then halted\r\nat Camp Scott awaiting orders to advance. The wagoners, suddenly\r\nattacked, and, as usual, unarmed--their weapons being fastened inside\r\ntheir awnings--could offer no resistance, and the whole convoy was\r\nset on fire except two conveyances, which were left to carry back\r\nsupplies for the drivers till they could reach their homes. On this\r\noccasion the _dux facti_ was Lot Smith, a man of reputation for hard\r\nriding and general gallantry. The old Saint is always spoken of as a\r\ngood man who lives by “Mormon rule of wisdom.” As at Fort Sumter, no\r\nblood was spilled. So far the Mormons behaved with temper and prudence;\r\nbut this their first open act of rebellion against, or secession from,\r\nthe federal authority nearly proved fatal to them; had the helm of\r\ngovernment been held by a firmer hand than poor Mr. Buchanan’s, the\r\nscenes of Nauvoo would have been acted again at Great Salt Lake City.\r\nAs it was, all turned out _à merveille_ for the saints militant. They\r\nstill boast loudly of the achievement, and on the marked spot where it\r\nwas performed the juvenile emigrants of the creed erect dwarf graves\r\nand nameless “wooden” tomb-“stones” in derision of their enemies.\r\n\r\n[VALLEY OF THE GREEN RIVER.]\r\n\r\nAs sunset drew near we approached the banks of the Big Sandy River.\r\nThe bottom through which it flowed was several yards in breadth,\r\nbright green with grass, and thickly feathered with willows and\r\ncotton-wood. It showed no sign of cultivation; the absence of cereals\r\nmay be accounted for by its extreme cold; it freezes there every\r\nnight, and none but the hardiest grains, oats and rye, which here are\r\nlittle appreciated, could be made to grow. We are now approaching\r\nthe valley of the Green River, which, like many of the rivers in the\r\nEastern States, appears formerly to have filled a far larger channel.\r\nFlat tables and elevated terraces of horizontal strata--showing that\r\nthe deposit was made in still waters--with layers varying from a few\r\nlines to a foot in thickness, composed of hard clay, green and other\r\nsandstones, and agglutinated conglomerates, rise like islands from\r\nbarren plains, or form escarpments that buttress alternately either\r\nbank of the winding stream. Such, according to Captain Stansbury, is\r\nthe general formation of the land between the South Pass and the “Rim”\r\nof the Utah Basin.\r\n\r\nAdvancing over a soil alternately sandy and rocky--an iron flat that\r\ncould not boast of a spear of grass--we sighted a number of coyotes,\r\nfittest inhabitants of such a waste, and a long, distant line of dust,\r\nlike the smoke of a locomotive, raised by a herd of mules which were\r\nbeing driven to the corral. We were presently met by the Pony Express\r\nrider; he reined in to exchange news, which _de part et d’autre_ were\r\nsimply _nil_. As he pricked onward over the plain, the driver informed\r\nus, with a portentous rolling of the head, that Ichabod was an a’mighty\r\nfine “shyoot.” Within five or six miles of Green River we passed the\r\nboundary stone which bears Oregon on one side and Utah on the other. We\r\nhad now traversed the southeastern corner of the country of Long-eared\r\nmen,[109] and were entering Deserét, the Land of the Honey-bee.\r\n\r\n  [109] Oregon is supposed by Mr. Edward to have been named by the\r\n  Spaniards from the immensely lengthened ears (_orejones_) of the\r\n  Indians who inhabited it.\r\n\r\nAt 6 30 P.M. we debouched upon the bank of the Green River. The station\r\nwas the home of Mr. Macarthy, our driver. The son of a Scotchman\r\nwho had settled in the United States, he retained many signs of his\r\norigin, especially freckles, and hair which one might almost venture\r\nto describe as sandy; perhaps also, at times, he was rather o’er fond\r\nof draining “a cup o’ kindness yet.” He had lately taken to himself\r\nan English wife, the daughter of a Birmingham mechanic, who, before\r\nthe end of her pilgrimage to “Zion on the tops of the mountains,” had\r\nfallen considerably away from grace, and had incurred the risk of being\r\nbuffeted by Satan for a thousand years--a common form of commination\r\nin the New Faith--by marrying a Gentile husband.[110] The station had\r\nthe indescribable scent of a Hindoo village, which appears to result\r\nfrom the burning of _bois de vache_ and the presence of cattle: there\r\nwere sheep, horses, mules, and a few cows, the latter so lively that\r\nit was impossible to milk them. The ground about had the effect of an\r\noasis in the sterile waste, with grass and shrubs, willows and flowers,\r\nwild geraniums, asters, and various _cruciferæ_. A few trees, chiefly\r\nquaking asp, lingered near the station, but dead stumps were far more\r\nnumerous than live trunks. In any other country their rare and precious\r\nshade would have endeared them to the whole settlement; here they were\r\nnever safe when a log was wanted. The Western man is bred and perhaps\r\nborn--I believe devoutly in transmitted and hereditary qualities--with\r\nan instinctive dislike to timber in general. He fells a tree naturally\r\nas a bull-terrier worries a cat, and the admirable woodsman’s axe which\r\nhe has invented only serves to whet his desire to try conclusions with\r\nevery more venerable patriarch of the forest.[111] Civilized Americans,\r\nof course, lament the destructive mania, and the Latter-Day Saints\r\nhave learned by hard experience the inveterate evils that may arise in\r\nsuch a country from disforesting the ground. We supped comfortably at\r\nGreen-River Station, the stream supplying excellent salmon trout. The\r\nkichimichi, or buffalo berry,[112] makes tolerable jelly, and alongside\r\nof the station is a store where Mr. Burton (of Maine) sells “Valley\r\nTan” whisky.[113]\r\n\r\n  [110] Mr. Brigham Young, one of the most tolerant of a people whose\r\n  motto is toleration, would not, I believe, offer any but an official\r\n  objection to a Mormon member marrying a worthy Gentile; but even\r\n  he--and it could hardly be expected that he should--can not overlook\r\n  the sin of apostasy. The order of the faith runs thus: “We believe\r\n  that it is not right to prohibit members of the Church from marrying\r\n  out of the Church, if it be their determination so to do, but such\r\n  persons will be considered weak in the faith of our Lord and Savior\r\n  Jesus Christ.” The same view of the subject is taken, I need hardly\r\n  say, by the more rigid kind of Roman Catholic.\r\n\r\n  [111] Many of the blades, being made by convicts at the state\r\n  prisons, are sold cheap. The extent of the timber regions\r\n  necessitated this excellent implement, and the saving of labor on the\r\n  European article is enormous.\r\n\r\n  [112] A shrub 10-15 feet high, with a fruit about the size of a pea,\r\n  red like a wild rose-hip, and with a pleasant sub-acid flavor: the\r\n  Indians eat it with avidity, and it is cultivated in the gardens at\r\n  Great Salt Lake City.\r\n\r\n  [113] Tannery was the first technological process introduced into the\r\n  Mormon Valley; hence all home industry has obtained the sobriquet of\r\n  “Valley Tan.”\r\n\r\n[EXPLORATION YET TO BE DONE.]\r\n\r\nThe Green River is the Rio Verde of the Spaniards, who named it from\r\nits timbered shores and grassy islets: it is called by the Yuta Indians\r\nPiya Ogwe, or the Great Water; by the other tribes Sitskidiágí, or\r\n“Prairie-grouse River.” It was nearly at its lowest when we saw it; the\r\nbreadth was not more than 330 feet. In the flood-time it widens to 800\r\nfeet, and the depth increases from three to six. During the inundation\r\nseason a ferry is necessary, and when transit is certain the owner\r\nsometimes nets $500 a week, which is not unfrequently squandered in\r\na day. The banks are in places thirty feet high, and the bottom may\r\naverage three miles from side to side. It is a swift-flowing stream,\r\nrunning as if it had no time to lose, and truly it has a long way to\r\ngo. Its length, volume, and direction entitle it to the honor of being\r\ncalled the head water of the great Rio Colorado, or Colored River, a\r\nlarger and more important stream than even the Columbia. There is some\r\ngrand exploration still to be done upon the line of the Upper Colorado,\r\nespecially the divides which lie between it and its various influents,\r\nthe Grand River and the Yaquisilla, of which the wild trapper brings\r\nhome many a marvelous tale of beauty and grandeur. Captain T. A. Gove,\r\nof the 10th Regiment of Infantry, then stationed at Camp Floyd, told\r\nme that an expedition had often been projected: a party of twenty-five\r\nto thirty men, well armed and provided with inflatable boats, might\r\npass without unwarrantable risk through the sparsely populated Indian\r\ncountry: a true report concerning regions of which there are so many\r\nfalse reports, all wearing more or less the garb of fable--beautiful\r\nvalleys inclosed in inaccessible rocks, Indian cities and golden\r\ntreasures--would be equally interesting and important. I can not\r\nrecommend the undertaking to the European adventurer: the United States\r\nhave long since organized and perfected what was proposed in England\r\nduring the Crimean war, and which fell, as other projects then did,\r\nto the ground, namely, a corps of Topographical Engineers, a body of\r\nwell-trained and scientific explorers, to whose hands the task may\r\nsafely be committed.[114]\r\n\r\n  [114] The principal explorers under the United States government of\r\n  the regions lying west of the Mississippi, and who have published\r\n  works upon the subject, are the following:\r\n\r\n  1. Messrs. Lewis and Clarke, in 1804-6, first explored the Rocky\r\n  Mountains to the Columbia River.\r\n\r\n  2. Major Z. M. Pike, in 1805-7, visited the upper waters of the\r\n  Mississippi and the western regions of Louisiana.\r\n\r\n  3. Major, afterward Colonel S. H. Long, of the United States\r\n  Topographical Engineers, made two expeditions, one in 1819-20 to the\r\n  Rocky Mountains, another in 1823 to the Sources of the St. Peter and\r\n  the Lake of the Woods, whereby four volumes octavo were filled.\r\n\r\n  4. Governor Cass and Mr. Schoolcraft in 1820 explored the Sources of\r\n  the Mississippi and the regions west and south of Lake Superior.\r\n\r\n  5. Colonel H. Dodge, U. S. Army, in 1835 traveled 1600 miles from\r\n  Fort Leavenworth, and visited the regions between the Arkansas and\r\n  the Platte Rivers.\r\n\r\n  6. Captain Canfield, United States Topographical Engineers, in 1838\r\n  explored the country between Forts Leavenworth and Snelling.\r\n\r\n  7. Mr. M‘Cox, of Missouri, surveyed the boundaries of the Indian\r\n  reservations: his work was in part revised by the late Captain Hood,\r\n  United States Topographical Engineers.\r\n\r\n  8. Mr. Nicollet (French) in 1833-38 mapped the country west of the\r\n  Upper Mississippi: he was employed in 1838-9 to make a similar\r\n  scientific reconnoissance between the Mississippi and the Missouri,\r\n  on which occasion he was accompanied by Mr. Frémont. He died in 1842.\r\n\r\n  The explorations of Colonel Frémont, Captain Howard Stansbury,\r\n  Lieutenant Gunnison, and Lieutenant Warren have been frequently\r\n  alluded to in these pages.\r\n\r\n  9. Lieutenant, afterward Captain Charles Wilkes, U. S. Navy, set out\r\n  in 1838, and, after a long voyage of discovery in South America,\r\n  Oceanica, and the Antarctic continent, made San Francisco on August\r\n  11, 1841. It is remarkable that this officer’s party were actually\r\n  pitched upon the spot (New Helvetia, afterward called Sacramento\r\n  City) where Californian gold was dug by the Mormons.\r\n\r\n  10. Captain R. B. Marcy, U. S. Army, “discovered and explored,\r\n  located and marked out the wagon-road from Fort Smith, Arkansas, to\r\n  Santa Fé, New Mexico.” The road explorers, however, are too numerous\r\n  to specify.\r\n\r\n  11. Governor I. I. Stevens, of Washington Territory, surveyed in 1853\r\n  the northern land proposed for a Pacific railway near the 47°-49°\r\n  parallels, from St. Paul to Puget Sound. No portion of that line\r\n  had been visited since the days of Lewis and Clarke, except a small\r\n  portion toward the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\n  12. Captain Raynolds, United States Topographical Engineers,\r\n  accompanied by Colonel Bridger as guide and interpreter, is still\r\n  (1860) exploring the head-waters of the Yellow Stone River.\r\n\r\nWe passed a social evening at Green-River Station. It boasted of no\r\nless than three Englishwomen, two married, and one, the help, still\r\nsingle. Not having the Mormonite _retenue_, the dames were by no means\r\nsorry to talk about Birmingham and Yorkshire, their birthplaces. At 9\r\nP.M. arrived one of the road-agents, Mr. Cloete, from whom I gathered\r\nthat the mail-wagon which once ran from Great Salt Lake City had lately\r\nbeen taken off the road. The intelligence was by no means consolatory,\r\nbut a course of meditation upon the saying of the sage, “in for a\r\npenny, in for a pound,” followed by another visit to my namesake’s\r\ngrog-shop, induced a highly philosophical turn, which enabled me--with\r\nthe aid of a buffalo--to pass a comfortable night in the store.\r\n\r\n  _22d August. To Ham’s Fork and Millersville._\r\n\r\nWe were not under way before 8 A.M. Macarthy was again to take the\r\nlines, and a _Giovinetto_ returning after a temporary absence to a\r\nyoung wife is not usually rejoiced to run his course. Indeed, he felt\r\nthe inconveniences of a semi-bachelor life so severely, that he often\r\nthreatened in my private ear, _chemin faisant_, to throw up the whole\r\nconcern.\r\n\r\n[MICHAEL MARTIN’S STORE.--AN ORIGINAL.]\r\n\r\nAfter the preliminary squabble with the mules, we forded the pebbly\r\nand gravelly bed of the river--in parts it looks like a lake exhausted\r\nby drainage--whose swift surging waters wetted the upper spokes of the\r\nwheels, and gurgled pleasantly around the bags which contained the mail\r\nfor Great Salt Lake City.[115] We then ran down the river valley,\r\nwhich was here about one mile in breadth, in a smooth flooring of clay,\r\nsprinkled with water-rolled pebbles, overgrown in parts with willow,\r\nwild cherry, buffalo berries, and quaking asp. Macarthy pointed out in\r\nthe road-side a rough grave, furnished with the normal tomb-stone, two\r\npieces of wagon-board: it was occupied by one Farren, who had fallen by\r\nthe revolver of the redoubtable Slade. Presently we came to the store\r\nof Michael Martin, an honest Creole, who vended the staple of prairie\r\ngoods, Champagne, bottled cocktail, “eye-opener,” and other liquors,\r\ndry goods--linen drapery--a few fancy goods, ribbons, and finery;\r\nbrandied fruits, jams and jellies, potted provisions, buckskins,\r\nmoccasins, and so forth. Hearing that Lieutenant Dana was _en route_\r\nfor Camp Floyd, he requested him to take charge of $500, to be paid to\r\nMr. Livingston, the sutler, and my companion, with the obligingness\r\nthat marked his every action, agreed to deliver the dollars, _sauve_\r\nthe judgment of God in the shape of Indians, or “White Indians.”[116]\r\nAt the store we noticed a paralytic man. This original lived under the\r\ndelusion that it was impossible to pass the Devil’s Gate: his sister\r\nhad sent for him to St. Louis, and his friends tried to transport\r\nhim eastward in chairs; the only result was that he ran away before\r\nreaching the Gate, and after some time was brought back by Indians.\r\n\r\n  [115] Sticklers for strict democracy in the United States maintain,\r\n  on the principle that the least possible power should be delegated\r\n  to the federal government, that the transmission of correspondence\r\n  is no more a national concern than the construction of railways and\r\n  telegraphs, or the transit of passengers and goods. The present\r\n  system was borrowed from the monopolies of Europe, and was introduced\r\n  into America at a time when individual enterprise was inadequate\r\n  to the task; in the year one of the Republic it became, under the\r\n  direction of Benjamin Franklin, a state department, and, though men\r\n  argue in the abstract, few care to propose a private mail system,\r\n  which would undertake the management of some 27,000 scattered offices\r\n  and 40,000 poorly paid clerks.\r\n\r\n  On this line we saw all the evils of the contract system. The\r\n  requisite regularity and quickness was neglected, letters and papers\r\n  were often lost, the mail-bags were wetted or thrown carelessly\r\n  upon the ground, and those intrusted to the conductors were perhaps\r\n  destroyed. Both parties complain--the postmaster that the contractors\r\n  seek to drive too hard a bargain with the department, and the\r\n  contractors that they are carrying the mails at a loss. Since the\r\n  restoration (in 1858) of the postal communication with the United\r\n  States which was interrupted in 1857, the Mormons attempt to secure\r\n  good service by advertising their grievances, and with tolerable\r\n  success. Postmaster Morrill--a Gentile--complained energetically of\r\n  the mail service during the last year, that letters were wetted and\r\n  jumbled together, two of one month perhaps and one of another; that\r\n  magazines often arrived four months after date, and that thirty sacks\r\n  left at Rocky Ridge were lost. The consequence was that during my\r\n  stay at Great Salt Lake City the contractors did their duty.\r\n\r\n  When salaries are small and families large, post-office robberies\r\n  must at times be expected. The postal department have long adopted\r\n  the system of registered letters: upon payment of five cents instead\r\n  of three, the letter is placed in a separate bag, entered separately\r\n  in the office books, forwarded with certain precautions, and\r\n  delivered to the address only after a receipt from the recipient.\r\n  But the department disclaims all responsibility in case of loss or\r\n  theft, and the only value of the higher stamp is a somewhat superior\r\n  facility of tracking the document that bears it.\r\n\r\n  [116] A cant term for white thieves disguised as savages, which has a\r\n  terrible significancy a little farther West.\r\n\r\nResuming our journey, we passed two places where trains of fifty-one\r\nwagons were burned in 1857 by the Mormon Rangers: the black stains\r\nhad bitten into the ground like the blood-marks in the palace of\r\nHolyrood--a neat foundation for a structure of superstition. Not far\r\nfrom it was a deep hole, in which the plunderers had “cached” the\r\niron-work which they were unable to carry away. Emerging from the\r\nriver plain we entered upon another _mauvaise terre_, with knobs and\r\nelevations of clay and green gault, striped and banded with lines of\r\nstone and pebbles: it was a barren, desolate spot, the divide between\r\nthe Green River and its western influent, the shallow and somewhat\r\nsluggish Black’s Fork. The name is derived from an old trader: it is\r\ncalled by the Snakes Ongo Ogwe Pa, or “Pine-tree Stream;” it rises in\r\nthe Bear-River Mountains, drains the swamps and lakelets on the way,\r\nand bifurcates in its upper bed, forming two principal branches, Ham’s\r\nFork and Muddy Fork.\r\n\r\nNear the Pine-tree Stream we met a horse-thief driving four bullocks:\r\nhe was known to Macarthy, and did not look over comfortable. We had\r\nnow fallen into the regular track of Mormon emigration, and saw the\r\nwayfarers in their worst plight, near the end of the journey. We passed\r\nseveral families, and parties of women and children trudging wearily\r\nalong: most of the children were in rags or half nude, and all showed\r\ngratitude when we threw them provisions. The greater part of the men\r\nwere armed, but their weapons were far more dangerous to themselves\r\nand their fellows than to the enemy. There is not on earth a race of\r\nmen more ignorant of arms as a rule than the lower grades of English;\r\nbecoming an emigrant, the mechanic hears that it may be necessary\r\nto beat off Indians, so he buys the first old fire-arm he sees, and\r\nprobably does damage with it. Only last night a father crossed Green\r\nRiver to beg for a piece of cloth; it was intended to shroud the body\r\nof his child, which during the evening had been accidentally shot, and\r\nthe station people seemed to think nothing of the accident, as if it\r\nwere of daily recurrence. I was told of three, more or less severe,\r\nthat happened in the course of a month. The Western Americans, who are\r\nmostly accustomed to the use of weapons, look upon these awkwardnesses\r\nwith a profound contempt. We were now in a region of graves, and their\r\npresence in this wild was not a little suggestive.\r\n\r\nPresently we entered a valley in which green grass, low and dense\r\nwillows, and small but shady trees, an unusually vigorous vegetation,\r\nrefreshed, as though with living water, our eyes, parched and dazed by\r\nthe burning glare. Stock strayed over the pasture, and a few Indian\r\ntents rose at the farther side; the view was probably _pas grand’\r\nchose_, but we thought it splendidly beautiful. At midday we reached\r\nHam’s Fork, the northwestern influent of Green River, and there we\r\nfound a station. The pleasant little stream is called by the Indians\r\nTurugempa, the “Blackfoot Water.”\r\n\r\n[THE DIRTY HOUSE.]\r\n\r\nThe station was kept by an Irishman and a Scotchman--“Dawvid Lewis:”\r\nit was a disgrace; the squalor and filth were worse almost than\r\nthe two--Cold Springs and Rock Creek--which we called our horrors,\r\nand which had always seemed to be the _ne plus ultra_ of Western\r\ndiscomfort. The shanty was made of dry stone piled up against a\r\ndwarf cliff to save back wall, and ignored doors and windows. The\r\nflies--unequivocal sign of unclean living!--darkened the table and\r\ncovered every thing put upon it; the furniture, which mainly consisted\r\nof the different parts of wagons, was broken, and all in disorder; the\r\nwalls were impure, the floor filthy. The reason was at once apparent.\r\nTwo Irishwomen, sisters,[117] were married to Mr. Dawvid, and the house\r\nwas full of “childer,” the noisiest and most rampageous of their kind.\r\nI could hardly look upon the scene without disgust. The fair ones had\r\nthe porcine Irish face--I need hardly tell the reader that there are\r\nthree orders of physiognomy in that branch of the Keltic family, viz.,\r\nporcine, equine, and simian--the pig-faced, the horse-faced, and the\r\nmonkey-faced. Describing one I describe both sisters; her nose was\r\n“pugged,” apparently by gnawing hard potatoes before that member had\r\nacquired firmness and consistency; her face was powdered with freckles;\r\nher hair, and, indeed, her general costume, looked, to quote Mr. Dow’s\r\nsermon, as though she had been rammed through a bush fence into a world\r\nof wretchedness and woe. Her dress was unwashed and in tatters, and her\r\nfeet were bare; she would not even take the trouble to make for herself\r\nmoccasins. Moreover, I could not but notice that, though the house\r\ncontained two wives, it boasted only of one cubile, and had only one\r\ncubiculum. Such things would excite no surprise in London or Naples, or\r\neven in many of the country parts of Europe; but here, where ground is\r\nworthless, where building material is abundant, and where a few hours\r\nof daily labor would have made the house look at least respectable,\r\nI could not but wonder at it. My first impulse was to attribute the\r\nevil, uncharitably enough, to Mormonism; to renew, in fact, the\r\nstock-complaint of nineteen centuries’ standing--\r\n\r\n    “Fœcunda culpæ secula nuptias\r\n    Primùm inquinavere, et genus et domus.”\r\n\r\n  [117] A man (Mormon) may even marry a mother and her daughters:\r\n  usually the relationship with the former is Platonic; the tie,\r\n  however, is irregular, and has been contracted in ignorance of the\r\n  prohibited degrees.\r\n\r\n[A SCOTCH IDLER.]\r\n\r\nA more extended acquaintance with the regions west of the Wasach taught\r\nme that the dirt and discomfort were the growth of the land. To give\r\nthe poor devils their due, Dawvid was civil and intelligent, though a\r\nnoted dawdler, as that rare phenomenon, a Scotch idler, generally is.\r\nMoreover, his wives were not deficient in charity; several Indians came\r\nto the door, and none went away without a “bit” and a “sup.” During\r\nthe process of sketching one of these men, a Snake, distinguished\r\nby his vermilion’d hair-parting, eyes blackened, as if by lines of\r\nsoot or surma, and delicate Hindoo-like hands, my eye fell upon the\r\nGerman-silver handle of a Colt’s revolver, which had been stowed away\r\nunder the blankets, and a revolver in the Lamanite’s hands breeds evil\r\nsuspicions.\r\n\r\nAgain we advanced. The air was like the breath of a furnace; the sun\r\nwas a blaze of fire--accounting, by-the-by, for the fact that the human\r\nnose in these parts seems invariably to become cherry-red--all the\r\nnullahs were dried up, and the dust-pillars and mirage were the only\r\nmoving objects on the plain. Three times we forded Black’s Fork, and\r\nthen debouched once more upon a long flat. The ground was scattered\r\nover with pebbles of granite, obsidian, flint, and white, yellow, and\r\nsmoky quartz, all water-rolled. After twelve miles we passed Church\r\nButte, one of many curious formations lying to the left hand or south\r\nof the road. This isolated mass of stiff clay has been cut and ground\r\nby wind and rain into folds and hollow channels which from a distance\r\nperfectly simulate the pillars, groins, and massive buttresses of a\r\nruinous Gothic cathedral. The foundation is level, except where masses\r\nhave been swept down by the rain, and not a blade of grass grows upon\r\nany part. An architect of genius might profitably study this work of\r\nNature: upon that subject, however, I shall presently have more to say.\r\nThe Butte is highly interesting in a geological point of view; it shows\r\nthe elevation of the adjoining plains in past ages, before partial\r\ndeluges and the rains of centuries had effected the great work of\r\ndegradation.\r\n\r\nAgain we sighted the pretty valley of Black’s Fork, whose cool clear\r\nstream flowed merrily over its pebbly bed. The road was now populous\r\nwith Mormon emigrants; some had good teams, others hand-carts, which\r\nlooked like a cross between a wheel-barrow and a tax-cart. There was\r\nnothing repugnant in the demeanor of the party; they had been civilized\r\nby traveling, and the younger women, who walked together and apart\r\nfrom the men, were not too surly to exchange a greeting. The excessive\r\nbarrenness of the land presently diminished; gentian and other\r\nodoriferous herbs appeared, and the greasewood, which somewhat reminded\r\nme of the Sindhian camel-thorn, was of a lighter green than elsewhere,\r\nand presented a favorable contrast with the dull glaucous hues of the\r\neternal prairie sage. We passed a dwarf copse so strewed with the bones\r\nof cattle as to excite our astonishment: Macarthy told us that it was\r\nthe place where the 2d Dragoons encamped in 1857, and lost a number of\r\ntheir horses by cold and starvation. The wolves and coyotes seemed to\r\nhave retained a predilection for the spot; we saw troops of them in\r\ntheir favorite “location”--the crest of some little rise, whence they\r\ncould keep a sharp look-out upon any likely addition to their scanty\r\nlarder.\r\n\r\n[THE UNGENIAL MAN.]\r\n\r\nAfter sundry steep inclines we forded another little stream, with a\r\nmuddy bed, shallow, and about thirty feet wide: it is called Smith’s\r\nFork, rises in the “Bridger Range” of the Uinta Hills, and sheds into\r\nBlack’s Fork, the main drain of these parts. On the other side stood\r\nMillersville, a large ranch with a whole row of unused and condemned\r\nwagons drawn up on one side. We arrived at 5 15 P.M., having taken\r\nthree hours and fifteen minutes to get over twenty miles. The tenement\r\nwas made of the component parts of vehicles, the chairs had backs of\r\nyoke-bows, and the fences which surrounded the corral were of the same\r\nmaterial. The station was kept by one Holmes, an American Mormon, and\r\nan individual completely the reverse of genial; he dispensed his words\r\nas if shelling out coin, and he was never--by us at least--seen to\r\nsmile. His wife was a pretty young Englishwoman, who had spent the best\r\npart of her life between London and Portsmouth; when alone with me she\r\ntook the opportunity of asking some few questions about old places,\r\nbut this most innocent _tête-à-tête_ was presently interrupted by the\r\nprotrusion through the open door of a _tête de mari au naturel_, with\r\na truly _renfrogné_ and vinegarish aspect, which made him look like a\r\ncalamity. After supplying us with a supper which was clean and neatly\r\nserved, the pair set out for an evening ride, and toward night we heard\r\nthe scraping of a violin, which reminded me of Tommaso Scarafaggio:\r\n\r\n    “Detto il sega del villagio\r\n    Perché suona il violino.”\r\n\r\nThe “fiddle” was a favorite instrument with Mr. Joseph Smith, as the\r\nharp with David; the Mormons, therefore, at the instance of their\r\nprophet, are not a little addicted to the use of the bow. We spent a\r\ncomfortable night at Millersville. After watching the young moon as she\r\nsailed through the depths of a firmament unstained by the least fleck\r\nof mist, we found some scattered volumes which rendered us independent\r\nof our unsocial Yankee host.\r\n\r\n  _23d August. Fort Bridger._\r\n\r\n[“UNCLE JACK.”]\r\n\r\nWe breakfasted early the next morning, and gladly settled accounts with\r\nthe surly Holmes, who had infected--probably by following the example\r\nof Mr. Caudle in later life--his pretty wife with his own surliness.\r\nShortly after starting--at 8 30 A.M.--we saw a little clump of seven\r\nIndian lodges, which our experience soon taught us were the property\r\nof a white; the proprietor met us on the road, and was introduced with\r\ndue ceremony by Mr. Macarthy. “Uncle Jack” (Robinson, really) is a\r\nwell-known name between South Pass and Great Salt Lake City; he has\r\nspent thirty-four years in the mountains, and has saved some $75,000,\r\nwhich have been properly invested at St. Louis; as might be expected,\r\nhe prefers the home of his adoption and his Indian spouse, who has made\r\nhim the happy father of I know not how many children, to good society\r\nand bad air farther east.\r\n\r\nOur road lay along the valley of Black’s Fork, which here flows\r\nfrom the southwest to the northeast; the bottom produced in plenty\r\nluxuriant grass, the dandelion, and the purple aster, thickets of a\r\nshrub-like hawthorn (_cratægus_), black and white currants, the willow\r\nand the cotton-wood. When almost in sight of the military post we were\r\naddressed by two young officers, one of them an assistant surgeon, who\r\nhad been engaged in the healthful and exciting pursuit of a badger,\r\nwhose markings, by-the-by, greatly differ from the European; they\r\nrecognized the uniform, and accompanied us to the station.\r\n\r\nFort Bridger lies 124 miles from Great Salt Lake City; according to\r\nthe drivers, however, the road might be considerably shortened. The\r\nposition is a fertile basin cut into a number of bits by Black’s\r\nFork, which disperses itself into four channels about 1·5 mile above\r\nthe station, and forms again a single bed about two miles below. The\r\nfort is situated upon the westernmost islet. It is, as usual, a mere\r\ncantonment, without any attempt at fortification, and at the time of\r\nmy visit was garrisoned by two companies of foot, under the command of\r\nCaptain F. Gardner, of the 10th Regiment. The material of the houses\r\nis pine and cedar brought from the Uinta Hills, whose black flanks\r\nsupporting snowy cones rise at the distance of about thirty-five miles.\r\nThey are a sanitarium, except in winter, when under their influence the\r\nmercury sinks to -20° F., not much less rigorous than Minnesota, and\r\nthey are said to shelter grizzly bears and an abundance of smaller game.\r\n\r\nThe fort was built by Colonel James Bridger, now the oldest trapper on\r\nthe Rocky Mountains, of whom Messrs. Frémont and Stansbury have both\r\nspoken in the highest terms. He divides with Christopher Carson, the\r\nKit Carson of the Wind River and the Sierra Nevada explorations, the\r\nhonor of being the best guide and interpreter in the Indian country:\r\nthe palm for prudence is generally given to the former; for dash and\r\nhard fighting to the latter, although, it is said, the mildest mannered\r\nof men. Colonel Bridger, when an Indian trader, placed this post upon\r\na kind of neutral ground between the Snakes and Crows (Hapsaroke) on\r\nthe north, the Ogalalas and other Sioux to the east, the Arapahoes and\r\nCheyennes on the south, and the various tribes of Yutas (Utahs) on the\r\nsouthwest. He had some difficulties with the Mormons, and Mrs. Mary\r\nEttie Smith, in a volume concerning which something will be said at\r\na future opportunity, veraciously reports his barbarous murder, some\r\nyears ago, by the Danite band. He was at the time of my visit absent on\r\nan exploratory expedition with Captain Raynolds.\r\n\r\n[A SORE SUBJECT.]\r\n\r\nArrived at Fort Bridger, our first thought was to replenish our\r\nwhisky-keg: its emptiness was probably due to the “rapid evaporation in\r\nsuch an elevated region imperfectly protected by timber;” but, however\r\nthat may be, I never saw liquor disappear at such a rate before. _Par\r\nparenthèse_, our late friends the officials had scarcely been more\r\nfortunate: they had watched their whisky with the eyes of Argus,\r\nyet, as the driver facetiously remarked, though the quantity did not\r\ndiminish too rapidly, the quality lost strength every day. We were\r\nconducted by Judge Carter to a building which combined the function\r\nof post-office and sutler’s store, the judge being also sutler, and\r\nperforming both parts, I believe, to the satisfaction of every one.\r\nAfter laying in an ample provision of biscuits for Miss May and\r\nkorn-schnapps for ourselves, we called upon the commanding officer, who\r\nintroduced us to his officers, and were led by Captain Cumming to his\r\nquarters, where, by means of chat, “solace-tobacco,” and toddy--which\r\nin these regions signifies “cold with”--we soon worked our way\r\nthrough the short three quarters of an hour allowed us. The officers\r\ncomplained very naturally of their isolation and unpleasant duty, which\r\nprincipally consists in keeping the roads open for, and the Indians\r\nfrom cutting off, parties of unmanageable emigrants, who look upon the\r\nfederal army as their humblest servants. At Camp Scott, near Bridger,\r\nthe army of the federal government halted under canvas during the\r\nsevere winter of 1857-1858, and the subject is still sore to military\r\nears.\r\n\r\n[BEER SPRINGS.]\r\n\r\nWe left Bridger at 10 A.M. Macarthy explained away the disregard for\r\nthe comfort of the public on the part of the contractors in not having\r\na station at the fort by declaring that they could obtain no land in\r\na government reservation; moreover, that forage there would be scarce\r\nand dear, while the continual influx of Indians would occasion heavy\r\nlosses in cattle. At Bridger the road forks: the northern line leads\r\nto Soda or Beer Springs,[118] the southern to Great Salt Lake City.\r\nFollowing the latter, we crossed the rough timber bridges that spanned\r\nthe net-work of streams, and entered upon another expanse of degraded\r\nground, covered as usual with water-rolled pebbles of granite and\r\nporphyry, flint and greenstone. On the left was a butte with steep\r\nbluff sides, called the Race-course: the summit, a perfect _mesa_, is\r\nsaid to be quite level, and to measure exactly a mile round--the rule\r\nof the American hippodrome. Like these earth formations generally, it\r\npoints out the ancient level of the land before water had washed away\r\nthe outer film of earth’s crust. The climate in this part, as indeed\r\nevery where between the South Pass and the Great Salt Lake Valley,\r\nwas an exaggeration of the Italian, with hot days, cool nights, and an\r\nincomparable purity and tenuity of atmosphere. We passed on the way a\r\nparty of emigrants, numbering 359 souls and driving 39 wagons. They\r\nwere commanded by the patriarch of Mormondom, otherwise Captain John\r\nSmith, the eldest son of Hyrum Smith, a brother of Mr. Joseph Smith the\r\nProphet, and who, being a child at the time of the murderous affair at\r\nCarthage, escaped being coiffe’d with the crown of martyrdom. He rose\r\nto the patriarchate on the 18th of February, 1855; his predecessor\r\nwas “old John Smith”--uncle to Mr. Joseph, and successor to Mr. Hyrum\r\nSmith--who died the 23d of May, 1854. He was a fair-complexioned man,\r\nwith light hair. His followers accepted gratefully some provisions with\r\nwhich we could afford to part.\r\n\r\n  [118] These springs of sadly prosaic name are the greatest curiosity\r\n  to be seen on the earth. They lie but a short distance east of the\r\n  junction of the Fort Hall and the California roads, and are scattered\r\n  over, perhaps, 40 acres of volcanic ground. They do not, like most\r\n  springs, run out of the sides of hills, but boil up directly from a\r\n  level plain. The water contains a gas, and has quite an acid taste:\r\n  when exposed to the sun or air, it passes but a short distance before\r\n  it takes the formation of a crust or solid coat of scarlet hue, so\r\n  that the continued boiling of any of these fountains will “create a\r\n  stone to the height of its source (15 or twenty feet) some 10 to 20\r\n  feet in diameter at the bottom, and from 2 to 3 feet at the top.”\r\n  After arriving at a uniform height, the water has ceased to run from\r\n  several of the “eyes” to burst out in some other place. The water\r\n  spurts from some of these very beautifully.--Horn’s “Overland Guide\r\n  to California,” p. 38. They are also described by Colonel Frémont:\r\n  “Expedition to Oregon and North California (1843-44),” p. 136.\r\n\r\nAfter passing the Mormons we came upon a descent which appeared little\r\nremoved from an angle of 35°, and suggested the propriety of walking\r\ndown. There was an attempt at a zigzag, and, for the benefit of wagons,\r\na rough wall of stones had been run along the sharper corners. At the\r\nfoot of the hill we remounted, and, passing through a wooded bottom,\r\nreached at 12 15 P.M.--after fording the Big Muddy--Little Muddy Creek,\r\nupon whose banks stood the station. Both these streams are branches of\r\nthe Ham’s Fork of Green River; and, according to the well-known “rule\r\nof contrairy,” their waters are clear as crystal, showing every pebble\r\nin their beds.\r\n\r\nLittle Muddy was kept by a Canadian, a chatty, lively, good-humored\r\nfellow blessed with a sour English wife. Possibly the heat--the\r\nthermometer showed 95° F. in the shade--had turned her temper;\r\nfortunately, it had not similarly affected the milk and cream, which\r\nwere both unusually good. Jean-Baptiste, having mistaken me for a\r\n_Française de France_, a being which he seemed to regard as little\r\nlower than the angels--I was at no pains to disabuse him--was profuse\r\nin his questionings concerning his imperial majesty, the emperor,\r\ncarefully confounding him with the first of the family; and so pleased\r\nwas he with my responses, that for the first time on that route I found\r\na man ready to spurn _cet animal féroce qu’on appelle la pièce de cinq\r\nfrancs_--in other words, the “almighty dollar.”\r\n\r\nWe bade adieu to Little Muddy at noon, and entered a new country, a\r\nbroken land of spurs and hollows, in parts absolutely bare, in others\r\nclothed with a thick vegetation. Curiously shaped hills, and bluffs of\r\nred earth capped with a clay which much resembled snow, bore a thick\r\ngrowth of tall firs and pines whose sombre uniform contrasted strangely\r\nwith the brilliant leek-like, excessive green foliage, and the tall,\r\nnote-paper-colored trunks of the ravine-loving quaking asp (_Populus\r\ntremuloides_). The mixture of colors was bizarre in the extreme, and\r\nthe lay of the land, an uncouth system of converging, diverging, and\r\nparallel ridges, with deep divisions--in one of these ravines, which is\r\nunusually broad and grassy, rise the so-called Copperas Springs--was\r\nhardly less striking. We ran winding along a crest of rising ground,\r\npassing rapidly, by way of farther comparison, two wretched Mormons,\r\nman and woman, who were driving, at a snail’s pace, a permanently lamed\r\nox, and after a long ascent stood upon the summit of Quaking-Asp Hill.\r\n\r\n[QUAKING-ASP HILL.]\r\n\r\nQuaking-Asp Hill, according to the drivers, is 1000 feet higher than\r\nthe South Pass, which would exalt its station to 8400 feet; other\r\nauthorities, however, reduce it to 7900. The descent was long and\r\nrapid--so rapid, indeed, that oftentimes when the block of wood which\r\nformed our brake dropped a bit of the old shoe-sole nailed upon it\r\nto prevent ignition, I felt, as man may be excused for feeling, that\r\ncatching of the breath that precedes the first five-barred gate after\r\na night of “heavy wet.” The sides of the road were rich in vegetation,\r\nstunted oak, black-jack, and box elder of the stateliest stature; above\r\nrose the wild cherry, and the service-tree formed the bushes below.\r\nThe descent, besides being decidedly sharp, was exceedingly devious,\r\nand our frequent “shaves”--a train of Mormon wagons was crawling down\r\nat the same time--made us feel somewhat thankful that we reached the\r\nbottom without broken bones.\r\n\r\nThe train was commanded by a Captain Murphy, who, as one might expect\r\nfrom the name, had hoisted the Stars and Stripes--it was the only\r\ninstance of such loyalty seen by us on the Plains. The emigrants had\r\nleft Council Bluffs on the 20th of June, an unusually late date, and,\r\nthough weather-beaten, all looked well. Inspirited by our success in\r\nsurmounting the various difficulties of the way, we “poked fun” at an\r\nold Yorkshireman, who was assumed, by way of mirth, to be a Cœlebs in\r\nsearch of polygamy at an epoch of life when perhaps the blessing might\r\ncome too late; and at an exceedingly plain middle-aged and full-blooded\r\nnegro woman, who was fairly warned--the children of Ham are not\r\nadmitted to the communion of the Saints, and consequently to the\r\nforgiveness of sins and a free seat in Paradise--that she was “carrying\r\ncoals to Newcastle.”\r\n\r\n[SULPHUR CREEK.]\r\n\r\nAs the rays of the sun began to slant we made Sulphur Creek; it lies at\r\nthe foot of a mountain called Rim Base, because it is the eastern wall\r\nof the great inland basin; westward of this point the waters can no\r\nlonger reach the Atlantic or the Pacific; each is destined to feed the\r\nlakes,\r\n\r\n    “Nec Oceani pervenit ad undas.”\r\n\r\nBeyond Sulphur Creek, too, the face of the country changes; the\r\nsedimentary deposits are no longer seen; the land is broken and\r\nconfused, upheaved into huge masses of rock and mountains broken by\r\ndeep kanyons, ravines, and water-gaps, and drained by innumerable\r\nstreamlets. The exceedingly irregular lay of the land makes the road\r\ndevious, and the want of level ground, which is found only in dwarf\r\nparks and prairillons, would greatly add to the expense of a railway.\r\nWe crossed the creek, a fetid stagnant water, about ten feet wide,\r\nlying in a bed of black infected mud: during the spring rains, when\r\nflowing, it is said to be wholesome enough. On the southern side of the\r\nvalley there are some fine fountains, and on the eastern are others\r\nstrongly redolent of sulphur; broad seams of coal crop out from the\r\nnorthern bluffs, and about a mile distant in the opposite direction\r\nare the Tar Springs, useful for greasing wagon-wheels and curing\r\ngalled-backed horses.\r\n\r\nFollowing the valley, which was rough and broken as it well could be,\r\nwe crossed a small divide, and came upon the plain of the Bear River,\r\na translation of the Indian Kuiyápá. It is one of the most important\r\ntributaries of the Great Salt Lake. Heading in the Uinta Range to\r\nthe east of Kamas Prairie,[119] it flows with a tortuous course to\r\nthe northwest, till, reaching Beer Springs, it turns sharply round\r\nwith a horseshoe bend, and sets to the southwest, falling into the\r\ngeneral reservoir at a bight called Bear-River Bay. According to the\r\nmountaineers, it springs not far from the sources of the Weber River\r\nand of the Timpanogos Water. Coal was found some years ago upon the\r\nbanks of the Bear River, and more lately near Weber River and Silver\r\nCreek. It is the easternmost point to which Mormonism can extend\r\n_main forte_; for fugitives from justice “over Bear River” is like\r\n“over Jordan.” The aspect of the valley, here half a mile broad, was\r\nprepossessing. Beyond a steep terrace, or step which compelled us all\r\nto dismount, the clear stream, about 400 feet in width, flowed through\r\nnarrow lines of willows, cotton-wood, and large trees, which waved in\r\nthe cool refreshing western wind; grass carpeted the middle levels, and\r\nabove all rose red cliffs and buttresses of frowning rock.\r\n\r\n  [119] So called from the _Camassia esculenta_, the Pomme des\r\n  Prairies or Pomme Blanche of the Canadians, and the prairie turnip\r\n  and breadroot of the Western hunters. The Kamas Prairie is a pretty\r\n  little bit of clear and level ground near the head of the Timpanogos\r\n  River.\r\n\r\n[ROUGH-AND-TUMBLE.--MR. MACARTHY.]\r\n\r\nWe reached the station at 5 30 P.M. The valley was dotted with the\r\ntents of the Mormon emigrants, and we received sundry visits of\r\ncuriosity; the visitors, mostly of the sex conventionally termed\r\nthe fair, contented themselves with entering, sitting down, looking\r\nhard, tittering to one another, and departing with Parthian glances\r\nthat had little power to hurt. From the men we heard tidings of “a\r\nmassacree” of emigrants in the north, and a defeat of Indians in the\r\nwest. Mr. Myers, the station-master, was an English Saint, who had\r\nlately taken to himself a fifth wife, after severally divorcing the\r\nothers; his last choice was not without comeliness, but her reserve\r\nwas extreme; she could hardly be coaxed out of a “Yes, sir.” I found\r\nMr. Myers diligently perusing a translation of “Volney’s Ruins of\r\nEmpire;” we had a chat about the Old and the New Country, which led us\r\nto sleeping-teme. I had here a curious instance of the effect of the\r\nassociation of words, in hearing a by-stander apply to the Founder\r\nof Christianity the “Mr.” which is the “_Kyrios_” of the West, and\r\nis always prefixed to “Joseph Smith:” he stated that the mission of\r\nthe latter was “far ahead of” that of the former prophet, which,\r\nby-the-by, is not the strict Mormon doctrine. My companion and his\r\nfamily preferred as usual the interior of the mail-wagon, and it was\r\nwell that they did so; after a couple of hours entered Mr. Macarthy,\r\nvery drunk and “fighting mad.” He called for supper, but supper was\r\npast and gone, so he supped upon “fids” of raw meat. Excited by this\r\nlively food, he began a series of caprioles, which ended, as might\r\nbe expected, in a rough-and-tumble with the other three youths who\r\noccupied the hard floor of the ranch. To Mr. Macarthy’s language on\r\nthat occasion _horresco referens_; every word was apparently English,\r\nbut so perverted, misused, and mangled, that the home reader would\r\nhardly have distinguished it from High-Dutch: _e. g._, “I’m intire\r\nmad as a meat-axe; now du don’t, I tell ye; say, _you_, shut up in a\r\nwinkin’, or I’ll be chawed up if I don’t run over _you_; ’can’t come\r\nthat ’ere tarnal carryin’ on over _me_,” and--_O si sic omnia!_ As no\r\nweapons, revolvers, or bowie-knives were to the fore, I thought the\r\nbest thing was to lie still and let the storm blow over, which it did\r\nin a quarter of an hour. Then, all serene, Mr. Macarthy called for a\r\npipe, excused himself ceremoniously to himself for taking the liberty\r\nwith the “Cap’s.” meerschaum solely upon the grounds that it was the\r\nonly article of the kind to be found at so late an hour, and presently\r\nfell into a deep slumber upon a sleeping contrivance composed of a\r\ntable for the upper and a chair for the lower portion of his person.\r\nI envied him the favors of Morpheus: the fire soon died out, the cold\r\nwind whistled through the crannies, and the floor was knotty and uneven.\r\n\r\n  _Echo Kanyon. August 24th._\r\n\r\nAt 8 15 A.M. we were once more _en voyage_. Mr. Macarthy was very\r\nred-eyed as he sat on the stool of penitence: what seemed to vex\r\nhim most was having lost certain newspapers directed to a friend\r\nand committed to his private trust, a mode of insuring their safe\r\narrival concerning which he had the day before expressed the highest\r\nopinion. After fording Bear River--this part of the land was quite\r\na grave-yard--we passed over rough ground, and, descending into a\r\nbush, were shown on a ridge to the right a huge Stonehenge, a crown\r\nof broken and somewhat lanceolate perpendicular conglomerates or\r\ncemented pudding-stones called not inappropriately Needle Rocks. At\r\nEgan’s Creek, a tributary of the Yellow Creek, the wild geraniums and\r\nthe willows flourished despite the six feet of snow which sometimes\r\nlies in these bottoms. We then crossed Yellow Creek, a water trending\r\nnortheastward, and feeding, like those hitherto forded, Bear River: the\r\nbottom, a fine broad meadow, was a favorite camping-ground, as the\r\nmany fire-places proved. Beyond the stream we ascended Yellow-Creek\r\nHill, a steep chain which divides the versant of the Bear River\r\neastward from that of Weber River to the west. The ascent might be\r\navoided, but the view from the summit is a fine panorama. The horizon\r\nbehind us is girt by a mob of hills, Bridger’s Range, silver-veined\r\nupon a dark blue ground; nearer, mountains and rocks, cones and\r\nhog-backs, are scattered about in admirable confusion, divided by\r\nshaggy rollers and dark ravines, each with its own little water-course.\r\nIn front the eye runs down the long bright red line of Echo Kanyon,\r\nand rests with astonishment upon its novel and curious features, the\r\nsublimity of its broken and jagged peaks, divided by dark abysses, and\r\nbased upon huge piles of disjointed and scattered rock. On the right,\r\nabout half a mile north of the road, and near the head of the kanyon,\r\nis a place that adds human interest to the scene. Cache Cave is a dark,\r\ndeep, natural tunnel in the rock, which has sheltered many a hunter\r\nand trader from wild weather and wilder men: the wall is probably of\r\nmarl and earthy limestone, whose whiteness is set off by the ochrish\r\nbrick-red of the ravine below.\r\n\r\n[ECHO KANYON.]\r\n\r\nEcho Kanyon has a total length of twenty-five to thirty miles, and\r\nruns in a southeasterly direction to the Weber River. Near the head it\r\nis from half to three quarters of a mile wide, but its irregularity\r\nis such that no average breadth can be assigned to it. The height of\r\nthe buttresses on the right or northern side varies from 300 to 500\r\nfeet; they are denuded and water-washed by the storms that break upon\r\nthem under the influence of southerly gales; their strata here are\r\nalmost horizontal; they are inclined at an angle of 45°, and the strike\r\nis northeast and southwest. The opposite or southern flank, being\r\nprotected from the dashing and weathering of rain and wind, is a mass\r\nof rounded soil-clad hills, or sloping slabs of rock, earth-veiled,\r\nand growing tussocks of grass. Between them runs the clear, swift,\r\nbubbling stream, in a pebbly bed now hugging one, then the other side\r\nof the chasm: it has cut its way deeply below the surface; the banks\r\nor benches of stiff alluvium are not unfrequently twenty feet high; in\r\nplaces it is partially dammed by the hand of Nature, and every where\r\nthe watery margin is of the brightest green, and overgrown with grass,\r\nnettles, willow thickets, in which the hop is conspicuous, quaking asp,\r\nand other taller trees. Echo Kanyon has but one fault: its sublimity\r\nwill make all similar features look tame.\r\n\r\nWe entered the kanyon in somewhat a serious frame of mind; our team\r\nwas headed by a pair of exceedingly restive mules; we had remonstrated\r\nagainst the experimental driving being done upon our vile bodies,\r\nbut the reply was that the animals must be harnessed at some time.\r\nWe could not, however, but remark the wonderful picturesqueness of a\r\nscene--of a nature which in parts seemed lately to have undergone some\r\ngrand catastrophe. The gigantic red wall on our right was divided into\r\ndistinct blocks or quarries by a multitude of minor lateral kanyons,\r\nwhich, after rains, add their tribute to the main artery, and each\r\nblock was subdivided by the crumbling of the softer and the resistance\r\nof the harder material--a clay conglomerate. The color varied in\r\nplaces from white and green to yellow, but for the most part it was a\r\ndull ochrish red, that brightened up almost to a straw tint where the\r\nsunbeams fell slantingly upon it from the strip of blue above. All\r\nserved to set off the curious architecture of the smaller masses. A\r\nwhole Petra was there, a system of projecting prisms, pyramids, and\r\npagoda towers, a variety of form that enabled you to see whatever your\r\npeculiar vanity might be--columns, porticoes, façades, and pedestals.\r\nTwin lines of bluffs, a succession of buttresses all fretted and\r\nhoneycombed, a double row of steeples slipped from perpendicularity,\r\nfrowned at each other across the gorge. And the wondrous variety was\r\nyet more varied by the kaleidoscopic transformation caused by change\r\nof position: at every different point the same object bore a different\r\naspect.\r\n\r\nAnd now, while we are dashing over the bouldered crossings; while\r\nour naughty mules, as they tear down the short steep pitches, swing\r\nthe wheels of the mail-wagon within half a foot of the high bank’s\r\ncrumbling edge; while poor Mrs. Dana closes her eyes and clasps her\r\nhusband’s hand, and Miss May, happily unconscious of all peril, amuses\r\nherself by perseveringly perching upon the last toe that I should have\r\nbeen inclined to offer, the monotony of the risk may be relieved by\r\ndiverting our thoughts to the lessons taught by the scenery around.\r\n\r\n[ART IN AMERICA.]\r\n\r\nAn American artist might extract from such scenery as Church Butte\r\nand Echo Kanyon a system of architecture as original and national\r\nas Egypt ever borrowed from her sandstone ledges, or the North of\r\nEurope from the solemn depths of her fir forests. But Art does not at\r\npresent exist in America; as among their forefathers farther east, of\r\nartists they have plenty, of Art nothing. We can explain the presence\r\nof the phenomenon in England, where that grotesqueness and bizarrerie\r\nof taste which is observable in the uneducated, and which, despite\r\ncollections and art-missions, hardly disappears in those who have\r\nstudied the purest models, is the natural growth of man’s senses and\r\nperceptions exposed for generation after generation to the unseen,\r\nunceasing, ever-active effect of homely objects, the desolate aspects\r\nof the long and dreary winters, and the humidity which shrouds the\r\nvisible world with its dull gray coloring. Should any one question the\r\nfact that Art is not yet English, let him but place himself in the\r\ncentre of the noblest site in Europe, Trafalgar Square, and own that\r\nno city in the civilized world ever presented such a perfect sample of\r\nbarbarous incongruity, from mast-headed Nelson with his coil behind\r\nhim, the work of the Satirist’s “one man and small boy,” to the two\r\ncontemptible squirting things that throw water upon the pavement at\r\nhis feet. Mildly has the “Thunderer” described it as the “chosen home\r\nof exquisite dullness and stilted mediocrity.” The cause above assigned\r\nto the fact is at least reasonable. Every traveler, who, after passing\r\nthrough the fruitful but unpicturesque orchard grounds lying between\r\nLa Manche and Paris, and the dull flats, with their melancholy poplar\r\nlines, between Paris and Lyons, arrives at Avignon, and observes the\r\npicturesqueness which every object, natural or artificial, begins to\r\nassume, the grace and beauty which appear even in the humblest details\r\nof scenery, must instinctively feel that he is entering the land of\r\nArt. Not of that Art which depends for development upon the efforts of\r\na few exceptional individuals, but the living Art which the constant\r\ncontemplation of a glorious nature,\r\n\r\n    “That holy Virgin of the sage’s creed,”\r\n\r\nmakes part of a people’s organization and development. Art, heavenly\r\nmaid, is not easily seduced to wander far from her place of birth.\r\nBorn and cradled upon the all-lovely shores of that inland sea, so\r\nchoicely formed by Nature’s hand to become the source and centre of\r\nmankind’s civilization, she loses health and spirits in the frigid\r\nsnowy north, while in the tropical regions--Nubia and India--her mind\r\nis vitiated by the rank and luxuriant scenery around her. A “pretty bit\r\nof home scenery,” with dumpy church tower--battlemented as the house of\r\nworship ought _not_ to be--on the humble hill, red brick cottages, with\r\nstraight tiled roofs and parallelogramic casements, and dwelling-houses\r\nall stiff-ruled lines and hard sharp angles, the straight road and the\r\ntrimmed hedgerow--such scenery, I assert, never can make an artistic\r\npeople; it can only lead, in fact, to a nation’s last phase of artistic\r\nbathos--a Trafalgar Square.\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Americans have other excuses, but not this. Their broad\r\nlands teem with varied beauties of the highest order, which it would\r\nbe tedious to enumerate. They have used, for instance, the Indian corn\r\nfor the acanthus in their details of architecture--why can not they\r\ntry a higher flight? Man may not, we readily grant, expect to be a\r\ngreat poet because Niagara is a great cataract; yet the presence of\r\nsuch objects must quicken the imagination of the civilized as of the\r\nsavage race that preceded him. It is true that in America the class\r\nthat can devote itself exclusively to the cultivation and the study of\r\nrefinement and art is still, comparatively speaking, small; that the\r\ncare of politics, the culture of science, mechanical and theoretic,\r\nand the pursuit of cash, have at present more hold upon the national\r\nmind than what it is disposed to consider the effeminating influences\r\nof the humanizing studies; that, moreover, the efforts of youthful\r\ngenius in the body corporate, as in the individual, are invariably\r\nimitative, leading through the progressive degrees of reflection and\r\nreproduction to originality. But, valid as they are, these reasons\r\nwill not long justify such freaks as the Americo-Grecian capitol at\r\nRichmond, a barn with the tritest of all exordiums, a portico which\r\nis original in one point only, viz., that it wants the portico’s only\r\njustification--steps; or the various domes originally borrowed from\r\nthat bulb which has been demolished at Washington, scattered over the\r\ncountry, and suggesting the idea that the shape has been borrowed from\r\nthe butt end of a sliced cucumber. Better far the warehouses of Boston,\r\nwith their monoliths and frontages of rough Quincy granite; they, at\r\nleast, are unpretending, and of native growth: no bad test of the\r\nnative mind.\r\n\r\n[ECHO STATION.--AN EXPERIMENT.]\r\n\r\nAfter a total of eighteen miles we passed Echo Station, a half-built\r\nranch, flanked by well-piled haystacks for future mules. The ravine\r\nnarrowed as we advanced to a mere gorge, and the meanderings of the\r\nstream contracted the road and raised the banks to a more perilous\r\nheight. A thicker vegetation occupied the bottom, wild roses and\r\ndwarfish oaks contending for the mastery of the ground. About four\r\nmiles from the station we were shown a defile where the Latter-Day\r\nSaints, in 1857, headed by General D. H. Wells, now the third member\r\nof the Presidency, had prepared modern Caudine Forks for the attacking\r\narmy of the United States. Little breastworks of loose stones, very\r\nlike the “sangahs” of the Affghan Ghauts, had been thrown up where the\r\nprecipices commanded the road, and there were four or five remains of\r\ndams intended to raise the water above the height of the soldiers’\r\nammunition pouches. The situation did not appear to me well chosen.\r\nAlthough the fortified side of the bluff could not be crowned on\r\naccount of deep chasms that separated the various blocks, the southern\r\nacclivities might have been occupied by sharpshooters so effectually\r\nthat the fire from the breastworks would soon have been silenced;\r\nmoreover, the defenders would have risked being taken in rear by a\r\nparty creeping through the chapparal[120] in the sole of the kanyon.\r\nMr. Macarthy related a characteristic trait concerning two warriors of\r\nthe Nauvoo Legion. Unaccustomed to perpendicular fire, one proposed\r\nthat his comrade should stand upon the crest of the precipice and see\r\nif the bullet reached him or not; the comrade, thinking the request\r\nhighly reasonable, complied with it, and received a yäger-ball through\r\nhis forehead.\r\n\r\n  [120] The Spanish “chapparal” means a low oak copse. The word has\r\n  been naturalized in Texas and New Mexico, and applied to the dense\r\n  and bushy undergrowth, chiefly of briers and thorns, disposed in\r\n  patches from a thicket of a hundred yards to the whole flank of a\r\n  mountain range (especially in the Mexican Tierra Caliente), and so\r\n  closely entwined that nothing larger than a wolf can force a way\r\n  through it.\r\n\r\nTraces of beaver were frequent in the torrent-bed; the “broad-tailed\r\nanimal” is now molested by the Indians rather than by the whites. On\r\nthis stage magpies and ravens were unusually numerous; foxes slunk\r\naway from us, and on one of the highest bluffs a coyote stood as on\r\na pedestal; as near Baffin Sea, these craggy peaks are their favorite\r\nhowling-places during the severe snowy winters. We longed for a\r\nthunder-storm: flashing lightnings, roaring thunders, stormy winds,\r\nand dashing rains--in fact, a tornado--would be the fittest setting\r\nfor such a picture, so wild, so sublime as Echo Kanyon. But we longed\r\nin vain. The day was persistently beautiful, calm and mild as a May\r\nforenoon in the Grecian Archipelago. We were also disappointed in\r\nour natural desire to hold some converse with the nymph who had lent\r\nher name to the ravine--the reverberation is said to be remarkably\r\nfine--but the temper of our animals would not have endured it, and the\r\nplace was not one that admitted experiments. Rain had lately fallen,\r\nas we saw from the mud-puddles in the upper course of the kanyon, and\r\nthe road was in places pitted with drops which were not frequent enough\r\nto allay the choking dust. A fresh yet familiar feature now appeared.\r\nThe dews, whose existence we had forgotten on the prairies, were cold\r\nand clammy in the early mornings; the moist air, condensed by contact\r\nwith the cooler substances on the surface of the ground, stood in\r\nlarge drops upon the leaves and grasses. As we advanced the bed of the\r\nravine began to open out, the angle of descent became more obtuse; a\r\nstretch of level ground appeared in front, where for some hours the\r\nwindings of the kanyon had walled us in, and at 2 30 P.M. we debouched\r\nupon the Weber-River Station. It lies at the very mouth of the ravine,\r\nalmost under the shadow of lofty red bluffs, called “The Obelisks;” and\r\nthe green and sunny landscape, contrasting with the sterile grandeur\r\nbehind, is exceedingly pleasing.\r\n\r\nAfter the emotions of the drive, a little rest was by no means\r\nunpleasant. The station was tolerably comfortable, and the welcome\r\naddition of potatoes and onions to our usual fare was not to\r\nbe despised. The tenants of the ranch were Mormons, civil and\r\ncommunicative. They complained sadly of the furious rain-storms, which\r\nthe funnel-like gorge brings down upon them, and the cold draughts from\r\nfive feet deep of snow which pour down upon the milder valley.\r\n\r\n[BAUCHMIN’S CREEK.--CARSON-HOUSE STATION.]\r\n\r\nAt 4 30 we resumed our journey along the plain of the Weber or Webber\r\nRiver. It is second in importance only to the Bear River: it heads near\r\nthe latter, and, flowing in a devious course toward the northwest,\r\nfalls into the Great Salt Lake a few miles south of its sister stream,\r\nand nearly opposite Frémont’s Island. The valley resembles that\r\ndescribed in yesterday’s diary; it is, however, narrower, and the steep\r\nborders, which, if water-washed, would be red like the kanyon rocks,\r\nare well clothed with grass and herbages. In some places the land is\r\ndefended by snake-fences in zigzags,[121] to oppose the depredations of\r\nemigrants’ cattle upon the wheat, barley, and stunted straggling corn\r\nwithin. After fording the river and crossing the bottom, we ascended\r\nsteep banks, passed over a spring of salt water five miles from the\r\nstation, and halted for a few minutes to exchange news with the\r\nmail-wagon that had left Great Salt Lake City this (Friday) morning.\r\nFollowed a rough and rugged tract of land apparently very trying to the\r\nway-worn cattle; many deaths had taken place at this point, and the\r\ndead lay well preserved as the monks of St. Bernard. After a succession\r\nof chuck-holes, rises, and falls, we fell into the valley of Bauchmin’s\r\nCreek. It is a picturesque hollow; at the head is a gateway of red\r\nclay, through which the stream passes; the sides also are red, and as\r\nthe glow and glory of the departing day lingered upon the heights, even\r\nartemisia put on airs of bloom and beauty, blushing in contrast with\r\nthe sharp metallic green of the quaking asp and the duller verdure of\r\nthe elder (_Alnus viridis_). As the evening closed in, the bottom-land\r\nbecame more broken, the path less certain, and the vegetation thicker:\r\nthe light of the moon, already diminished by the narrowness of the\r\nvalley, seemed almost to be absorbed by the dark masses of copse and\r\nbush. We were not sorry to make, at 7 45 P.M., the “Carson-House\r\nStation” at Bauchmin’s Fork--the traveling had been fast, seven miles\r\nan hour--where we found a log hut, a roaring fire, two civil Mormon\r\nlads, and some few “fixins” in the way of food. We sat for a time\r\ntalking about matters of local importance, the number of emigrants,\r\nand horse-thieves, the prospects of the road, and the lay of the land.\r\nBauchmin’s Fork, we learned, is a branch of East Kanyon Creek, itself\r\na tributary of the Weber River;[122] from the station an Indian trail\r\nleads over the mountains to Provo City. I slept comfortably enough upon\r\nthe boards of an inner room, not, however, without some apprehensions\r\nof accidentally offending a certain skunk (_Mephitis mephitica_),\r\nwhich was in the habit of making regular nocturnal visits. I heard its\r\npuppy-like bark during the night, but escaped what otherwise might have\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\n  [121] This is the simplest of all fences, and therefore much used\r\n  in the West. Tree-trunks are felled, and either used whole or split\r\n  into rails; they are then disposed in a long serrated line, each\r\n  resting upon another at both ends, like the fingers of a man’s right\r\n  hand extended and inserted between the corresponding fingers of the\r\n  left. The zigzag is not a picturesque object: in absolute beauty it\r\n  is inferior even to our English trimmed hedgerow; but it is very\r\n  economical, it saves space, it is easily and readily made, it can\r\n  always serve for fuel, and, therefore, is to be respected, despite\r\n  the homeliness of its appearance.\r\n\r\n  [122] In Captain Stansbury’s map, Bauchmin’s Fork is a direct\r\n  influent, and one of the largest, too, of the Weber River.\r\n\r\nAnd why, naturally asks the reader, did you not shut the door? Because\r\nthere was none.\r\n\r\n  _The End--Hurrah! August 25th._\r\n\r\nTo-day we are to pass over the Wasach,[123] the last and highest chain\r\nof the mountain mass between Fort Bridger and the Great Salt Lake\r\nValley, and--by the aid of St. James of Compostella, who is, I believe,\r\nbound over to be the patron of pilgrims in general--to arrive at our\r\ndestination, New Hierosolyma, or Jerusalem, alias Zion on the tops of\r\nthe mountains, the future city of Christ, where the Lord is to reign\r\nover the Saints, as a temporal king, in power and great glory.\r\n\r\n  [123] The word is generally written _Wasatch_ or _Wahsatch_. In the\r\n  latter the _h_ is, as usual, _de trop_; and in both the _t_, though\r\n  necessary in French, is totally uncalled for in English.\r\n\r\nSo we girt our loins, and started, after a cup of tea and a biscuit,\r\nat 7 A.M., under the good guidance of Mr. Macarthy, who, after a\r\nwhiskyless night, looked forward not less than ourselves to the run\r\nin. Following the course of Bauchmin’s Creek, we completed the total\r\nnumber of fordings to thirteen in eight miles. The next two miles were\r\nalong the bed of a water-course, a complete fiumara, through a bush\r\nfull of tribulus, which accompanied us to the end of the journey.\r\nPresently the ground became rougher and steeper: we alighted, and set\r\nour beasts manfully against “Big Mountain,” which lies about four miles\r\nfrom the station. The road bordered upon the wide arroyo, a tumbled\r\nbed of block and boulder, with water in places oozing and trickling\r\nfrom the clay walls, from the sandy soil, and from beneath the heaps of\r\nrock--living fountains these, most grateful to the parched traveler.\r\nThe synclinal slopes of the chasm were grandly wooded with hemlocks,\r\nfirs, balsam-pines, and other varieties of abies, some tapering up to\r\nthe height of ninety feet, with an admirable regularity of form, color,\r\nand foliage. The varied hues of the quaking asp were there; the beech,\r\nthe dwarf oak, and a thicket of elders and wild roses; while over\r\nall the warm autumnal tints already mingled with the bright green of\r\nsummer. The ascent became more and more rugged: this steep pitch, at\r\nthe end of a thousand miles of hard work and semi-starvation, causes\r\nthe death of many a wretched animal, and we remarked that the bodies\r\nare not inodorous among the mountains as on the prairies. In the most\r\nfatiguing part we saw a hand-cart halted, while the owners, a man, a\r\nwoman, and a boy, took breath. We exchanged a few consolatory words\r\nwith them and hurried on. The only animal seen on the line, except the\r\ngrasshopper, whose creaking wings gave forth an ominous note, was the\r\npretty little chirping squirrel. The trees, however, in places bore the\r\nmarks of huge talons, which were easily distinguished as the sign of\r\nbears. The grizzly does not climb except when young: this was probably\r\nthe common brown variety. At half way the gorge opened out, assuming\r\nmore the appearance of a valley; and in places, for a few rods, were\r\ndwarf stretches of almost level ground. Toward the Pass-summit the rise\r\nis sharpest: here we again descended from the wagon, which the four\r\nmules had work enough to draw, and the total length of its eastern rise\r\nwas five miles. Big Mountain lies eighteen miles from the city. The top\r\nis a narrow crest, suddenly forming an acute based upon an obtuse angle.\r\n\r\nFrom that eyrie, 8000 feet above sea level, the weary pilgrim first\r\nsights his shrine, the object of his long wanderings, hardships, and\r\nperils, the Happy Valley of the Great Salt Lake. The western horizon,\r\nwhen visible, is bounded by a broken wall of light blue mountain, the\r\nOquirrh, whose northernmost bluff buttresses the southern end of the\r\nlake, and whose eastern flank sinks in steps and terraces into a river\r\nbasin, yellow with the sunlit golden corn, and somewhat pink with its\r\ncarpeting of heath-like moss. In the foreground a semicircular sweep\r\nof hill-top and an inverted arch of rocky wall shuts out all but a few\r\nspans of the valley. These heights are rough with a shaggy forest, in\r\nsome places black-green, in others of brownish-red, in others of the\r\nlightest ash-color, based upon a ruddy soil; while a few silvery veins\r\nof snow still streak the bare gray rocky flanks of the loftiest peak.\r\n\r\n[BIG KANYON CREEK.--THE DANITE.]\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes’ delay to stand and gaze, we resumed the footpath\r\nway, while the mail-wagon, with wheels rough-locked, descended what\r\nappeared to be an impracticable slope. The summit of the Pass was\r\nwell-nigh cleared of timber; the woodman’s song informed us that the\r\nevil work was still going on, and that we are nearly approaching a\r\nlarge settlement. Thus stripped of their protecting fringes, the\r\nmountains are exposed to the heat of summer, that sends forth countless\r\nswarms of devastating crickets, grasshoppers, and blue-worms; and to\r\nthe wintry cold, that piles up, four to six feet high--the mountain-men\r\nspeak of thirty and forty--the snows drifted by the unbroken force\r\nof the winds. The Pass from November to February can be traversed by\r\nnothing heavier than “sleighs,” and during the snow-storms even these\r\nare stopped. Falling into the gorge of Big Kanyon Creek, after a total\r\nof twelve hard miles from Bauchmin’s Fork, we reached at 11 30 the\r\nstation that bears the name of the water near which it is built. We\r\nwere received by the wife of the proprietor, who was absent at the time\r\nof our arrival; and half stifled by the thick dust and the sun, which\r\nhad raised the glass to 103°, we enjoyed copious draughts--_tant soit\r\npeu_ qualified--of the cool but rather hard water that trickled down\r\nthe hill into a trough by the house side. Presently the station-master,\r\nspringing from his light “sulky,” entered, and was formally introduced\r\nto us by Mr. Macarthy as Mr. Ephe Hanks. I had often heard of this\r\nindividual as one of the old triumvirate of Mormon desperadoes, the\r\nother two being Orrin Porter Rockwell and Bill Hickman--as the leader\r\nof the dreaded Danite band, and, in short, as a model ruffian. The ear\r\noften teaches the eye to form its pictures: I had eliminated a kind of\r\nmental sketch of those assassin faces which one sees on the Apennines\r\nand Pyrenees, and was struck by what met the eye of sense. The “vile\r\nvillain,” as he has been called by anti-Mormon writers, who verily do\r\nnot try to _ménager_ their epithets, was a middle-sized, light-haired,\r\ngood-looking man, with regular features, a pleasant and humorous\r\ncountenance, and the manly manner of his early sailor life, touched\r\nwith the rough cordiality of the mountaineer. “Frank as a bear-hunter”\r\nis a proverb in these lands. He had, like the rest of the triumvirate,\r\nand like most men (Anglo-Americans) of desperate courage and fiery,\r\nexcitable temper, a clear, pale blue eye, verging upon gray, and\r\nlooking as if it wanted nothing better than to light up, together with\r\na cool and quiet glance that seemed to shun neither friend nor foe.\r\n\r\nThe terrible Ephe began with a facetious allusion to all our new\r\ndangers under the roof of a Danite, to which, in similar strain, I\r\nmade answer that Danite or Damnite was pretty much the same to me.\r\nAfter dining, we proceeded to make trial of the air-cane, to which he\r\ntook, as I could see by the way he handled it, and by the nod with\r\nwhich he acknowledged the observation, “almighty convenient sometimes\r\nnot to make a noise, Mister,” a great fancy. He asked me whether I\r\nhad a mind to “have a slap” at his namesake,[124] an offer which was\r\ngratefully accepted, under the promise that “cuffy” should previously\r\nbe marked down so as to save a long ride and a troublesome trudge over\r\nthe mountains. His battery of “killb’ars” was heavy and in good order,\r\nso that on this score there would have been no trouble, and the only\r\ntool he bade me bring was a Colt’s revolver, dragoon size. He told me\r\nthat he was likely to be in England next year, when he had set the “ole\r\nwoman” to her work. I suppose my look was somewhat puzzled, for Mrs.\r\nDana graciously explained that every Western wife, even when still, as\r\nMrs. Ephe was, in her teens, commands that venerable title, venerable,\r\nthough somehow not generally coveted.\r\n\r\n  [124] “Ole Ephraim” is the mountain-man’s _sobriquet_ for the grizzly\r\n  bear.\r\n\r\nFrom Big Kanyon Creek Station to the city, the driver “reckoned,” was\r\na distance of seventeen miles. We waited till the bright and glaring\r\nday had somewhat burned itself out; at noon heavy clouds came up from\r\nthe south and southwest, casting a grateful shade and shedding a few\r\ndrops of rain. After taking friendly leave of the “Danite” chief--whose\r\ncordiality of manner had prepossessed me strongly in his favor--we\r\nentered the mail-wagon, and prepared ourselves for the finale over the\r\nwesternmost ridge of the stern Wasach.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  H.

CITY _UTAH_\r\n  SEPT. 20. 1860._]\r\n\r\n[A TICKLISH ROAD.]\r\n\r\nAfter two miles of comparatively level ground we came to the foot of\r\n“Little Mountain,” and descended from the wagon to relieve the poor\r\ndevils of mules. The near slope was much shorter, but also it was\r\nsteeper far than “Big Mountain.” The counterslope was easier, though by\r\nno means pleasant to contemplate with the chance of an accident to the\r\nbrake, which in all inconvenient places would part with the protecting\r\nshoe-sole. Beyond the eastern foot, which was ten miles distant from\r\nour destination, we were miserably bumped and jolted over the broken\r\nground at the head of Big Kanyon. Down this pass, whose name is a\r\ntranslation of the Yuta name Obitkokichi, a turbulent little mountain\r\nstream tumbles over its boulder-bed, girt with the usual sunflower,\r\nvines of wild hops, red and white willows, cotton-wood, quaking asp,\r\nand various bushes near its cool watery margin, and upon the easier\r\nslopes of the ravine, with the shin or dwarf oak (_Quercus nana_),\r\nmountain mahogany, balsam, and other firs, pines, and cedars. The road\r\nwas a narrow shelf along the broader of the two spaces between the\r\nstream and the rock, and frequent fordings were rendered necessary by\r\nthe capricious wanderings of the torrent. I could not but think how\r\nhorrid must have been its appearance when the stout-hearted Mormon\r\npioneers first ventured to thread the defile, breaking their way\r\nthrough the dense bush, creeping and clinging like flies to the sides\r\nof the hills. Even now accidents often occur; here, as in Echo Kanyon,\r\nwe saw in more than one place unmistakable signs of upsets in the shape\r\nof broken spokes and yoke-bows. At one of the most ticklish turns\r\nMacarthy kindly pointed out a little precipice where four of the mail\r\npassengers fell and broke their necks, a pure invention on his part, I\r\nbelieve, which fortunately, at that moment, did not reach Mrs. Dana’s\r\nears. He also entertained us with many a tale, of which the hero was\r\nthe redoubtable Hanks: how he had slain a buffalo bull single-handed\r\nwith a bowie-knife; and how, on one occasion, when refused hospitality\r\nby his Lamanite brethren, he had sworn to have the whole village to\r\nhimself, and had redeemed his vow by reappearing _in cuerpo_, with\r\ngestures so maniacal that the sulky Indians all fled, declaring him to\r\nbe “bad medicine.” The stories had at least local coloring.\r\n\r\n[EMIGRATION KANYON.]\r\n\r\nIn due time, emerging from the gates, and portals, and deep serrations\r\nof the upper course, we descended into a lower level: here Big, now\r\ncalled Emigration Kanyon, gradually bulges out, and its steep slopes of\r\ngrass and fern, shrubbery and stunted brush, fall imperceptibly into\r\nthe plain. The valley presently lay full before our sight. At this\r\nplace the pilgrim emigrants, like the hajjis of Mecca and Jerusalem,\r\ngive vent to the emotions long pent up within their bosoms by sobs\r\nand tears, laughter and congratulations, psalms and hysterics. It is\r\nindeed no wonder that the children dance, that strong men cheer and\r\nshout, and that nervous women, broken with fatigue and hope deferred,\r\nscream and faint; that the ignorant should fondly believe that the\r\n“Spirit of God pervades the very atmosphere,” and that Zion on the tops\r\nof the mountains is nearer heaven than other parts of earth. In good\r\nsooth, though uninfluenced by religious fervor--beyond the natural\r\nsatisfaction of seeing a bran-new Holy City--even I could not, after\r\nnineteen days in a mail-wagon, gaze upon the scene without emotion.\r\n\r\nThe sublime and the beautiful were in present contrast. Switzerland and\r\nItaly lay side by side. The magnificent scenery of the past mountains\r\nand ravines still floated before the retina, as emerging from the\r\ngloomy depths of the Golden Pass--the mouth of Emigration Kanyon is\r\nmore poetically so called--we came suddenly in view of the Holy Valley\r\nof the West.\r\n\r\nThe hour was about 6 P.M.; the atmosphere was touched with a dreamy\r\nhaze, as it generally is in the vicinity of the lake; a little bank of\r\nrose-colored clouds, edged with flames of purple and gold, floated in\r\nthe upper air, while the mellow radiance of an American autumn, that\r\nbright interlude between the extremes of heat and cold, diffused its\r\nmild soft lustre over the face of earth.\r\n\r\nThe sun, whose slanting rays shone full in our eyes, was setting in a\r\nflood of heavenly light behind the bold, jagged outline of “Antelope\r\nIsland,” which, though distant twenty miles to the northwest, hardly\r\nappeared to be ten. At its feet, and then bounding the far horizon,\r\nlay, like a band of burnished silver, the Great Salt Lake, that still\r\ninnocent Dead Sea. Southwestward also, and equally deceptive as regards\r\ndistance, rose the boundary of the valley plain, the Oquirrh Range,\r\nsharply silhouetted by a sweep of sunshine over its summits, against\r\nthe depths of an evening sky, in that direction so pure, so clear,\r\nthat vision, one might fancy, could penetrate behind the curtain into\r\nregions beyond the confines of man’s ken. In the brilliant reflected\r\nlight, which softened off into a glow of delicate pink, we could\r\ndistinguish the lines of Brigham’s, Coon’s, and other kanyons, which\r\nwater has traced through the wooded flanks of the Oquirrh down to\r\nthe shadows already purpling the misty benches at their base. Three\r\ndistinct and several shades, light azure, blue, and brown-blue,\r\ngraduated the distances, which extended at least thirty miles.\r\n\r\nThe undulating valley-plain between us and the Oquirrh Range is 12·15\r\nmiles broad, and markedly concave, dipping in the centre like the\r\nsection of a tunnel, and swelling at both edges into bench-lands, which\r\nmark the ancient bed of the lake. In some parts the valley was green;\r\nin others, where the sun shot its oblique beams, it was of a tawny\r\nyellowish-red, like the sands of the Arabian desert, with scatters of\r\ntrees, where the Jordan of the West rolls its opaline wave through\r\npasture-lands of dried grass dotted with flocks and herds, and fields\r\nof ripening yellow corn. Every thing bears the impress of handiwork,\r\nfrom the bleak benches behind to what was once a barren valley in\r\nfront. Truly the Mormon prophecy had been fulfilled: already the\r\nhowling wilderness--in which twelve years ago a few miserable savages,\r\nthe half-naked Digger Indians, gathered their grass-seed, grasshoppers,\r\nand black crickets to keep life and soul together, and awoke with their\r\nwar-cries the echo of the mountains, and the bear, the wolf, and the\r\nfox prowled over the site of a now populous city--“has blossomed like\r\nthe rose.”\r\n\r\nThis valley--this lovely panorama of green, and azure, and gold--this\r\nland, fresh, as it were, from the hands of God, is apparently girt on\r\nall sides by hills: the highest peaks, raised 7000 to 8000 feet above\r\nthe plain of their bases, show by gulches veined with lines of snow\r\nthat even in this season winter frowns upon the last smile of summer.\r\n\r\nAdvancing, we exchanged the rough cahues and the frequent fords of\r\nthe ravine for a broad smooth highway, spanning the easternmost\r\nvalley-bench--a terrace that drops like a Titanic step from the midst\r\nof the surrounding mountains to the level of the present valley-plain.\r\nFrom a distance--the mouth of Emigration Kanyon is about 4·30 miles\r\nfrom the city--Zion, which is not on a hill, but, on the contrary,\r\nlies almost in the lowest part of the river-plain, is completely hid\r\nfrom sight, as if no such thing existed. Mr. Macarthy, on application,\r\npointed out the notabilia of the scene.\r\n\r\n[MOUNTAIN POINT.]\r\n\r\nNorthward, curls of vapor ascending from a gleaming sheet--the Lake\r\nof the Hot Springs--set in a bezel of emerald green, and bordered\r\nby another lake-bench upon which the glooms of evening were rapidly\r\ngathering, hung like a veil of gauze around the waist of the mountains.\r\nSouthward for twenty-five miles stretched the length of the valley,\r\nwith the little river winding its way like a silver thread in a brocade\r\nof green and gold. The view in this direction was closed by “Mountain\r\nPoint,” another formation of terraced range, which forms the water-gate\r\nof Jordan, and which conceals and separates the fresh water that feeds\r\nthe Salt Lake--the Sea of Tiberias from the Dead Sea.\r\n\r\n[THE HAPPY VALLEY.]\r\n\r\nAs we descend the Wasach Mountains, we could look back and enjoy the\r\nview of the eastern wall of the Happy Valley. A little to the north\r\nof Emigration Kanyon, and about one mile nearer the settlement, is\r\nthe Red Butte, a deep ravine, whose quarried sides show mottlings of\r\nthe light ferruginous sandstone which was chosen for building the\r\nTemple wall.[125] A little beyond it lies the single City of the Dead,\r\ndecently removed three miles from the habitations of the living, and\r\nfarther to the north is City-Creek Kanyon, which supplies the Saints\r\nwith water for drinking and for irrigation. Southeast of Emigration\r\nKanyon are other ravines, Parley’s, Mill Creek, Great Cotton-wood, and\r\nLittle Cotton-wood, deep lines winding down the timbered flanks of the\r\nmountains, and thrown into relief by the darker and more misty shading\r\nof the farther flank-wall.\r\n\r\n  [125] At first a canal was dug through the bench to bring this\r\n  material: the gray granite now used for the Temple is transported in\r\n  carts from the southern part of the valley.\r\n\r\nThe “Twin Peaks,” the highest points of the Wasach Mountains, are the\r\nfirst to be powdered over with the autumnal snow. When a black nimbus\r\nthrows out these piles, with their tilted-up rock strata, jagged edges,\r\nblack flanks, rugged brows, and bald heads gilt by a gleam of sunset,\r\nthe whole stands boldly out with that phase of sublimity of which the\r\nsense of immensity is the principal element. Even in the clearest of\r\nweather they are rarely free from a fleecy cloud, the condensation of\r\ncold and humid air rolling up the heights and vanishing only to be\r\nrenewed.\r\n\r\nThe bench-land then attracted our attention. The soil is poor,\r\nsprinkled with thin grass, in places showing a suspicious whiteness,\r\nwith few flowers, and chiefly producing a salsolaceous plant like the\r\nEnglish samphire. In many places lay long rows of bare circlets, like\r\ndeserted tent-floors; they proved to be ant-hills, on which light\r\nginger-colored swarms were working hard to throw up the sand and gravel\r\nthat every where in this valley underlie the surface. The eastern\r\nvalley-bench, upon whose western declivity the city lies, may be traced\r\non a clear day along the base of the mountains for a distance of twenty\r\nmiles: its average breadth is about eight miles.\r\n\r\nAfter advancing about 1·50 mile over the bench ground, the city by\r\nslow degrees broke upon our sight. It showed, one may readily believe,\r\nto special advantage after the succession of Indian lodges, Canadian\r\nranchos, and log-hut mail-stations of the prairies and the mountains.\r\nThe site has been admirably chosen for drainage and irrigation--so\r\nwell, indeed, that a “Deus ex machinâ” must be brought to account for\r\nit.[126] About two miles north, and overlooking the settlements from\r\na height of 400 feet, a detached cone, called Ensign Peak or Ensign\r\nMount, rises at the end of a chain which, projected westward from the\r\nmain range of the heights, overhangs and shelters the northeastern\r\ncorner of the valley. Upon this “big toe of the Wasach range,” as\r\nit is called by a local writer, the spirit of the martyred prophet,\r\nMr. Joseph Smith, appeared to his successor, Mr. Brigham Young, and\r\npointed out to him the position of the New Temple, which, after Zion\r\nhad “got up into the high mountain,” was to console the Saints for\r\nthe loss of Nauvoo the Beautiful. The city--it is about two miles\r\nbroad--runs parallel with the right bank of the Jordan, which forms its\r\nwestern limit. It is twelve to fifteen miles distant from the western\r\nrange, ten from the debouchure of the river, and eight to nine from\r\nthe nearest point of the lake--a respectful distance, which is not\r\nthe least of the position’s merits. It occupies the rolling brow of a\r\nslight decline at the western base of the Wasach--in fact, the lower,\r\nbut not the lowest level of the eastern valley-bench; it has thus a\r\ncompound slope from north to south, on the line of its water supplies,\r\nand from east to west, thus enabling it to drain off into the river.\r\n\r\n  [126] I have frequently heard this legend from Gentiles, never from\r\n  Mormons; yet even the Saints own that as early as 1842 visions of the\r\n  mountains and kanyons, the valley and the lake, were revealed to Mr.\r\n  Joseph Smith, jun., who declared it privily to the disciples whom\r\n  he loved. Thus Messrs. O. Pratt and E. Snow, apostles, were enabled\r\n  to recognize the Promised Land, as, the first of the pioneers, they\r\n  issued from the ravines of the Wasach. Of course the Gentiles declare\r\n  that the exodists hit upon the valley by the purest chance. The\r\n  spot is becoming classical: here Judge and Apostle Phelps preached\r\n  his “Sermon on the Mount,” which, anti-Mormons say, was a curious\r\n  contrast to the first discourse so named.\r\n\r\nThe city revealed itself, as we approached, from behind its screen, the\r\ninclined terraces of the upper table-land, and at last it lay stretched\r\nbefore us as upon a map. At a little distance the aspect was somewhat\r\nOriental, and in some points it reminded me of modern Athens without\r\nthe Acropolis. None of the buildings, except the Prophet’s house,\r\nwere whitewashed. The material--the thick, sun-dried adobe, common\r\nto all parts of the Eastern world[127]--was of a dull leaden blue,\r\ndeepened by the atmosphere to a gray, like the shingles of the roofs.\r\nThe number of gardens and compounds--each tenement within the walls\r\noriginally received 1·50 square acre, and those outside from five to\r\nten acres, according to their distance--the dark clumps and lines of\r\nbitter cotton-wood, locust, or acacia, poplars and fruit-trees, apples,\r\npeaches, and vines--how lovely they appeared, after the baldness of\r\nthe prairies!--and, finally, the fields of long-eared maize and sweet\r\nsorghum strengthened the similarity to an Asiatic rather than to an\r\nAmerican settlement. The differences presently became as salient. The\r\nfarm-houses, with their stacks and stock, strongly suggested the Old\r\nCountry. Moreover, domes and minarets--even churches and steeples--were\r\nwholly wanting, an omission that somewhat surprised me. The only\r\nbuilding conspicuous from afar was the block occupied by the present\r\nHead of the Church. The court-house, with its tinned Muscovian dome,\r\nat the west end of the city; the arsenal, a barn-like structure, on a\r\nbench below the Jebel Nur of the valley--Ensign Peak; and a saw-mill,\r\nbuilt beyond the southern boundary, were the next in importance.\r\n\r\n  [127] The very word is Spanish, derived from the Arabic ‏ألطوب‎\r\n  meaning “the brick;” it is known throughout the West, and is written\r\n  _adobies_, and pronounced _dobies_.\r\n\r\n[BULWARKS OF ZION.]\r\n\r\nOn our way we passed the vestiges of an old moat, from which was taken\r\nthe earth for the bulwarks of Zion. A Romulian wall, of puddle, mud,\r\nclay, and pebbles, six miles--others say 2600 acres--in length, twelve\r\nfeet high, six feet broad at the base, and two and three quarters\r\nat the top, with embrasures five to six feet above the ground, and\r\nsemi-bastions at half musket range, was decided, in 1853-54, to be\r\nnecessary, as a defense against the Lamanites, whose name in the vulgar\r\nis Yuta Indians. Gentiles declare that the bulwarks were erected\r\nbecause the people wanting work were likely to “strike” faith, and\r\nthat the amount of labor expended upon this folly would have irrigated\r\nas many thousand acres. Anti-Mormons have, of course, detected in the\r\nproceeding treacherous and treasonable intentions. Parenthetically,\r\nI must here warn the reader that in Great Salt Lake City there are\r\nthree distinct opinions concerning, three several reasons for, and\r\nthree diametrically different accounts of, every thing that happens,\r\nviz., that of the Mormons, which is invariably one-sided; that of\r\nthe Gentiles, which is sometimes fair and just; and that of the\r\nanti-Mormons, which is always prejudiced and violent. A glance will\r\nshow that this much-talked-of fortification is utterly harmless; it is\r\ncommanded in half a dozen places; it could not keep out half a dozen\r\nsappers for a quarter of an hour; and now, as it has done its work, its\r\nfoundations are allowed to become salt, and to crumble away.\r\n\r\nThe road ran through the Big Field, southeast of the city, six miles\r\nsquare, and laid off in five-acre lots. Presently, passing the\r\nprecincts of habitation, we entered, at a slapping pace, the second\r\nward, called Denmark, from its tenants, who mostly herd together. The\r\ndisposition of the settlement is like that of the nineteenth century\r\nNew-World cities--from Washington to the future metropolis of the\r\ngreat Terra Australis--a system of right angles, the roads, streets,\r\nand lanes, if they can be called so, intersecting one another. The\r\nadvantages or disadvantages of the rectangular plan have been exhausted\r\nin argument; the new style is best suited, I believe, for the New, as\r\nthe old must, perforce, remain in the Old World. The suburbs are thinly\r\nsettled; the mass of habitations lie around and south of Temple Block.\r\nThe streets of the suburbs are mere roads, cut by deep ups and downs,\r\nand by gutters on both sides, which, though full of pure water, have no\r\nbridge save a plank at the _trottoirs_. In summer the thoroughfares are\r\ndusty, in wet weather deep with viscid mud.\r\n\r\nThe houses are almost all of one pattern--a barn shape, with wings and\r\nlean-tos, generally facing, sometimes turned endways to the street,\r\nwhich gives a suburban look to the settlement; and the diminutive\r\ncasements show that window-glass is not yet made in the Valley. In the\r\nbest abodes the adobe rests upon a few courses of sandstone, which\r\nprevent undermining by water or ground-damp, and it must always be\r\nprotected by a coping from the rain and snow. The poorer are small,\r\nlow, and hut-like; others are long single-storied buildings, somewhat\r\nlike stables, with many entrances. The best houses resemble East Indian\r\nbungalows, with flat roofs, and low, shady verandas, well trellised,\r\nand supported by posts or pillars. All are provided with chimneys,\r\nand substantial doors to keep out the piercing cold. The offices are\r\nalways placed, for hygienic reasons, outside; and some have a story and\r\na half--the latter intended for lumber and other stores. I looked in\r\nvain for the out-house harems, in which certain romancers concerning\r\nthings Mormon had informed me that wives are kept, like any other\r\nstock. I presently found this but one of a multitude of delusions.\r\nUpon the whole, the Mormon settlement was a vast improvement upon its\r\ncontemporaries in the valleys of the Mississippi and the Missouri.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STORES IN MAIN STREET.]\r\n\r\n[GARDENS.]\r\n\r\nThe road through the faubourg was marked by posts and rails, which,\r\nas we advanced toward the heart of the city, were replaced by neat\r\npalings. The garden-plots were small, as sweet earth must be brought\r\ndown from the mountains; and the flowers were principally those of\r\nthe Old Country--the red French bean, the rose, the geranium, and\r\nthe single pink; the ground or winter cherry was common; so were\r\nnasturtiums; and we saw tansy, but not that plant for which our\r\nsouls, well-nigh weary of hopes of juleps long deferred, chiefly\r\nlusted--mint. The fields were large and numerous, but the Saints have\r\ntoo many and various occupations to keep them, Moravian-like, neat\r\nand trim; weeds overspread the ground; often the wild sunflower-tops\r\noutnumbered the heads of maize. The fruit had suffered from an\r\nunusually nipping frost in May; the peach-trees were barren; the vines\r\nbore no produce; only a few good apples were in Mr. Brigham Young’s\r\ngarden, and the watermelons were poor, yellow, and tasteless, like the\r\nAfrican. On the other hand, potatoes, onions, cabbages, and cucumbers\r\nwere good and plentiful, the tomato was ripening every where, fat\r\nfull-eared wheat rose in stacks, and crops of excellent hay were\r\nscattered about near the houses. The people came to their doors to see\r\nthe mail-coach, as if it were the “Derby dilly” of old, go by. I could\r\nnot but be struck by the modified English appearance of the colony, and\r\nby the prodigious numbers of the white-headed children.\r\n\r\n[THE HOTEL IN NEW ZION.]\r\n\r\nPresently we debouched upon the main thoroughfare, the centre of\r\npopulation and business, where the houses of the principal Mormon\r\ndignitaries and the stores of the Gentile merchants combine to form the\r\ncity’s only street which can be properly so called. It is, indeed, both\r\nstreet and market, for, curious to say, New Zion has not yet built for\r\nherself a bazar or market-place. Nearly opposite the Post-office, in a\r\nblock on the eastern side, with a long veranda, supported by trimmed\r\nand painted posts, was a two-storied, pent-roofed building, whose\r\nsign-board, swinging to a tall, gibbet-like flag-staff, dressed for the\r\noccasion, announced it to be the Salt Lake House, the principal, if not\r\nthe only establishment of the kind in New Zion. In the Far West, one\r\nlearns not to expect much of the hostelry;[128] I had not seen aught\r\nso grand for many a day. Its depth is greater than its frontage, and\r\nbehind it, secured by a _porte cochère_, is a large yard for corraling\r\ncattle. A rough-looking crowd of drivers, drivers’ friends, and idlers,\r\nalmost every man openly armed with revolver and bowie-knife, gathered\r\nround the doorway to greet Jim, and “prospect” the “new lot;” and the\r\nhost came out to assist us in transporting our scattered effects. We\r\nlooked vainly for a bar on the ground floor; a bureau for registering\r\nnames was there, but (temperance, in public at least, being the order\r\nof the day) the usual tempting array of bottles and decanters was\r\nnot forthcoming; up stairs we found a Gentile ballroom, a tolerably\r\nfurnished sitting-room, and bedchambers, apparently made out of a\r\nsingle apartment by partitions too thin to be strictly agreeable. The\r\nhousehold had its deficiencies; blacking, for instance, had run out,\r\nand servants could not be engaged till the expected arrival of the\r\nhand-cart train. However, the proprietor, Mr. Townsend, a Mormon, from\r\nthe State of Maine--when expelled from Nauvoo, he had parted with land,\r\nhouse, and furniture for $50--who had married an Englishwoman, was\r\nin the highest degree civil and obliging, and he attended personally\r\nto our wants, offered his wife’s services to Mrs. Dana, and put us\r\nall in the best of humors, despite the closeness of the atmosphere,\r\nthe sadness ever attending one’s first entrance into a new place,\r\nthe swarms of “emigration flies”--so called because they appear in\r\nSeptember with the emigrants, and, after living for a month, die off\r\nwith the first snow--and a certain populousness of bedstead, concerning\r\nwhich the less said the better. Such, gentle reader, are the results of\r\nmy first glance at Zion on the tops of the mountains, in the Holy City\r\nof the Far West.\r\n\r\n  [128] I subjoin one of the promising sort of advertisements:\r\n\r\n  “Tom Mitchell!!! dispenses comfort to the weary (!), feeds the hungry\r\n  (!!), and cheers the gloomy (!!!), at his old, well-known stand,\r\n  thirteen miles east of Fort Des Moines. _Don’t pass by me._”\r\n\r\nOur journey had occupied nineteen days, from the 7th to the 25th of\r\nAugust, both included; and in that time we had accomplished not less\r\nthan 1136 statute miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nFirst Week at Great Salt Lake City.--Preliminaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore entering upon the subject of the Mormons I would fain offer\r\nto the reader a few words of warning. During my twenty-four days at\r\nhead-quarters, ample opportunities of surface observation were afforded\r\nme. I saw, as will presently appear, specimens of every class, from the\r\nHead of the Church down to the field-hand, and, being a stranger in\r\nthe land, could ask questions and receive replies upon subjects which\r\nwould have been forbidden to an American of the States, more especially\r\nto an official. But there is in Mormondom, as in all other exclusive\r\nfaiths, whether Jewish, Hindoo, or other, an inner life into which I\r\ncan not flatter myself or deceive the reader with the idea of my having\r\npenetrated. At the same time, it is only fair to state that no Gentile,\r\neven the unprejudiced, who are _raræ aves_, however long he may live\r\nor intimately he may be connected with Mormons, can expect to see any\r\nthing but the superficies. The writings of the Faithful are necessarily\r\nwholly presumed. And, finally, the accounts of Life in the City of\r\nthe Saints published by anti-Mormons and apostates are venomous, and,\r\nas their serious discrepancies prove, thoroughly untrustworthy. I may\r\ntherefore still hope, by recounting honestly and truthfully as lies in\r\nmy power what I heard, and felt, and saw, and by allowing readers to\r\ndraw their own conclusions, to take new ground.\r\n\r\n[BIBLIOLOGY.]\r\n\r\nThe Mormons have been represented, and are generally believed to be,\r\nan intolerant race; I found the reverse far nearer the fact. The best\r\nproof of this is that there is hardly one anti-Mormon publication,\r\nhowever untruthful, violent, or scandalous, which I did not find in\r\nGreat Salt Lake City.[129] The extent of the subjoined bibliographical\r\nlist would deter me from a theme so used up by friend and foe, were\r\nit not for these considerations. In the first place, I have found,\r\nsince my return to England, a prodigious general ignorance of the\r\n“Mormon rule;” the mass of the public has heard of the Saints, but\r\neven well-educated men hold theirs to be a kind of socialistic or\r\ncommunist concern, where, as in the world to come, there is no marrying\r\nnor giving in marriage. Even where this is not the case, the reader\r\nof travels will not dislike to peruse something more of a theme with\r\nwhich he is already perhaps familiar; for in this department of\r\nliterature, as in history and biography, the more we know of a subject,\r\nthe more we want to know. Moreover, since 1857, no book of general\r\ninterest has appeared, and the Mormons are a progressive people,\r\nwhose “go-a-headitiveness” in social growth is only to be compared\r\nwith their obstinate conservatism in adhering to institutions that\r\ndate from the days of Abraham. Secondly, the natural history of the\r\nNew Faith--for such it is--through the several periods of conception,\r\nbirth, and growth to vigorous youth, with fair promise of stalwart\r\nmanhood, is a subject of general and no small importance. It interests\r\nthe religionist, who looks upon it as the “scourge of corrupted\r\nChristianity,” as much as the skeptic, that admires how, in these\r\ndays of steam-traveling, printing, and telegramming, when “many run to\r\nand fro,” and when “knowledge” has been “increased,” human credulity\r\nwill display itself in the same glaring colors which it wore ere the\r\ndiffusion of knowledge became a part of social labor. The philosophic\r\nobserver will detect in it a notable example of how _mens agitat\r\nmolem_, the “powerful personal influence of personal character,” and\r\nthe “effect that may be produced by a single mind inflexibly applied\r\nto the pursuit of a single object;” and another proof that “it is\r\neasier to extend the belief of the multitude than to contract it--a\r\ncircumstance which proceeds from the false but prevalent notion that\r\ntoo much belief is at least an error on the right side.” The statist\r\nwill consider it in its aspect as a new system of colonization.\r\nIn America the politician will look with curiosity at a despotism\r\nthriving in the centre of a democracy, and perhaps with apprehension\r\nat its future efforts, in case of war or other troubles, upon the\r\ndestinies of the whilom Great Republic. In England, which principally\r\nsupplies this number of souls, men, instead of regarding it as one of\r\nmany safety-valves, will be reminded of their obligations toward the\r\nclasses by which Mormonism is fed, and urged to the improvement of\r\neducation, religion, and justice. And I hope to make it appear that\r\nthe highly-colored social peculiarities of the New Faith have been\r\nused as a tool by designing men to raise up enmity against a peaceful,\r\nindustrious, and law-abiding people, whose whole history has been a\r\ncourse of cruel persecution, which, if man really believed in his own\r\nimprovement, would be a disgrace to a self-styled enlightened age.\r\nThe prejudice has naturally enough extended from America to England.\r\nIn 1845, when the Mormons petitioned for permission to retire to\r\nVancouver’s Island, they met with nothing but discouragement. And even\r\nin 1860, I am told, when a report was raised that Mr. Brigham Young\r\nwould willingly have taken refuge with his adherents in the valley of\r\nthe Saskatchawan, the British minister was instructed to oppose the\r\nuseful emigration to the utmost of his power.\r\n\r\n  [129] A list of works published upon the subject of Mormonism may not\r\n  be uninteresting. They admit of a triple division--the Gentile, the\r\n  anti-Mormon, and the Mormon.\r\n\r\n  Of the Gentiles, by which I understand the comparatively unprejudiced\r\n  observer, the principal are,\r\n\r\n  1. The Exploration and Survey of the Great Salt Lake by Captain\r\n  Stansbury, who followed up Colonel Frémont’s flying survey in 1849,\r\n  or two years before the Mormons had settled in the basin, and found\r\n  the young colony about 2-3 years old. Anti-Mormons find fault with\r\n  Captain Stansbury for expending upon their adversaries too much of\r\n  the milk of human kindness.\r\n\r\n  2. The Mormons or Latter-Day Saints, by Lieutenant J. W. Gunnison,\r\n  of the U. S. Topographical Engineers. This officer was second in\r\n  command of the exploration under Captain Stansbury, and has recorded,\r\n  in unpretending style and with great impartiality, his opinions\r\n  concerning the “rise and progress, peculiar doctrines, personal\r\n  conditions and prospects” of the Mormons, “derived from personal\r\n  observation.” Like his commanding officer, Lieutenant Gunnison is\r\n  accused of having favored the New Faith, and yet, with all the\r\n  inconsistency of the odium theologicum, the Faithful are charged with\r\n  his subsequent murder; the only motive of the foul deed being that\r\n  the Saints dreaded future disclosures, and were determined, though\r\n  one of their number had been sent to accompany Captain Stansbury as\r\n  assistant, to prevent other expeditions. Upon Lieutenant Gunnison’s\r\n  volume is founded “Les Mormons” of M. Étourneau, first printed in the\r\n  “Presse,” and afterward republished, Paris, 1856.\r\n\r\n  3. The Mormons; a Discourse delivered before the Historical Society\r\n  of Pennsylvania, March 26th, 1850, by Colonel T. L. Kane (U. S.\r\n  Militia): this gentleman, an eye-witness, who has touchingly, and,\r\n  I believe, truthfully related the details of the Nauvoo Exodus, is\r\n  called by anti-Mormons an “apologist,” and is suspected of being\r\n  a Latter-Day Saint--baptized under the name of Dr. Osborne--in\r\n  Christian disguise. Arrived at Fort Bridger in 1857, he found\r\n  assembled there the three heads of departments, Governor Cumming,\r\n  Chief Justice Eccles, and General Johnston. According to the Saints,\r\n  he was watched, spied, treated as a Mormon emissary, and nearly shot\r\n  by a mistake made on purpose; he was, however, supported by the\r\n  governor against the general, and the result was a coolness most\r\n  favorable to the New Faith. Colonel Kane is said to have preserved an\r\n  affectionate and respectful remembrance of his friends the Mormons.\r\n\r\n  4. History of the Mormons, by Messrs. Chambers, Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n  5. An Excursion to California, over the Prairies, Rocky Mountains,\r\n  and Great Sierra Nevada, by W. Kelly, Esq., J.P. Mr. Kelly, whose\r\n  work shared at the time of its appearance the interest and admiration\r\n  of the public with Messrs. Hue and Gabet’s Travels in Tartary, Tibet,\r\n  and the Chinese Empire, visited Great Salt Lake City in 1849, an\r\n  important epoch in the annals of the infant colony, and leaves the\r\n  reader only to regret that he devoted so little of his time and of\r\n  his two volumes to the history of the Saints.\r\n\r\n  6. The Mormons or Latter-Day Saints, with Memoirs of the Life\r\n  of Joseph Smith, the American Mahomet. Office of the National\r\n  Illustrated Library, 198 Strand, London. This little compilation,\r\n  dealing with facts rather than theories, borrows from the polemics\r\n  of both parties, and displays the calmness of judgment which results\r\n  from studying the subject at a distance; though Gentile, it is\r\n  somewhat in favor with Mormons because it shows some desire to speak\r\n  the truth. This solid merit has won it the honor of an abridged\r\n  translation with the title “Les Mormons” (292 pages in 12mo, Messrs.\r\n  Hachette, Paris, 1854), by M. Amédée Pichot, and a brilliant review\r\n  by M. Prosper Mérimée in the “Moniteur,” and reprinted in “Les\r\n  Mélanges Historiques et Littéraires” (p. 1-58, Michel Levy, 1855).\r\n\r\n  7. A Visit to Salt Lake, and a Residence in the Mormon Settlements\r\n  at Utah, by William Chandless. London: Smith, Elder, and Co., 1857.\r\n  Mr. Chandless, about the middle of July, 1855, crossed the prairies\r\n  in the character of a “teamster for pay,” spent the end of the\r\n  year at Great Salt Lake City, and thence traveled _viâ_ Fillmore\r\n  and San Bernardino to California. The book is exceedingly lively\r\n  and picturesque, combining pleasant reading with just observation,\r\n  impartiality, and good sense.\r\n\r\n  8. Voyage au Pays des Mormons, par Jules Remy (2 vols., E. Dentu,\r\n  Paris, 1860). The author, accompanied by Mr. Brenchley, M.A.,\r\n  traveled in July and the autumn of 1855 from San Francisco along the\r\n  line of the Carson and Humboldt Rivers to Great Salt Lake City, and\r\n  returned, like Mr. Chandless, by the southern road. The two volumes\r\n  are more valuable for the observations on the natural history of the\r\n  little-known basin, than for the generalisms, more or less sound,\r\n  with which the subject of the New Faith is discussed.\r\n\r\n  Not a few anomalies appear in the judgments passed by M. Remy upon\r\n  the Saints: while in some places they are represented as fervent\r\n  and full of faith, we also read: “Le Mormonisme n’a pas caractère\r\n  de spontanéité des religions primitives, ce qui va, du reste, de\r\n  soi, ni la naïveté des religions qui suivirent, ni la sincérité des\r\n  révélations ou des réformes religieuses qui, durant les siècles\r\n  derniers, out pris place dans l’histoire;” and while Mr. Joseph Smith\r\n  is in parts tenderly treated, he is ruthlessly characterized in p. 24\r\n  as _un fourbe et un imposteur_, a “savage and gigantic Tartuffe.” An\r\n  excellent English translation of this work has lately appeared, under\r\n  the auspices of Mr. Jeffs, Burlington Arcade, but an account of Great\r\n  Salt Lake City in 1855 is as archæological as a study of London life\r\n  in A.D. 1800.\r\n\r\n  9. Incidents of Travel and Adventure in the Far West, by M. Carvalho,\r\n  who accompanied Colonel Frémont in his last exploration. According to\r\n  anti-Mormons, the account of the Saints is far too favorable (1856).\r\n\r\n  10. Geological Survey of the Territory of Utah, by H. Englemann.\r\n  Washington, 1860.\r\n\r\n  The principal anti-Mormon works are the following, ranged in the\r\n  order of their respective dates. The _Cons_, it will be observed,\r\n  more than treble the _Pros_.\r\n\r\n  1. A brief History of the Church of Christ of Latter-Day Saints\r\n  (commonly called Mormons), including an Account of their Doctrine\r\n  and Discipline, with the reason of the Author for leaving the said\r\n  Church, by John Corrill, a member of the Legislature of Missouri (50\r\n  pages, 8vo, St. Louis, 1839). I know nothing beyond the name of this\r\n  little work, or of the nine following.\r\n\r\n  2. Addresses on Mormonism, by the Rev. Hays Douglas (Isle of Man,\r\n  1839).\r\n\r\n  3. Mormonism weighed in the Balances of the Sanctuary and found\r\n  Wanting, by Samuel Haining (66 pages, Douglas, Isle of Man, 1839).\r\n\r\n  4. The Latter-Day Saints and Book of Mormon. By W. J. Morrish,\r\n  Ledbury.\r\n\r\n  5. An Exposure of the Errors and Fallacies of the Self-named\r\n  Latter-Day Saints. By W. Hewitt, Staffordshire.\r\n\r\n  6. Tract on Mormonism. By Capt. D. L. St. Clair. (1840.)\r\n\r\n  7. Mormonism Unveiled. By E. D. Howe. (1841.)\r\n\r\n  8. Mormonism Exposed. By the Rev. L. Sunderland. (1841.)\r\n\r\n  9. Mormonism Portrayed; its Errors and Absurdities Exposed, and the\r\n  Spirit and Designs of its Author made Manifest. By W. Harris (64\r\n  pages, Warsaw, Illinois, 1841).\r\n\r\n  10. Mormonism in all Ages; or, the Rise, Progress, and Causes of\r\n  Mormonism; with the Biography of its Author and Founder, Joseph\r\n  Smith, junior. By Professor J. B. Turner, Illinois College,\r\n  Jacksonville. (304 pages, 12mo, New York, 1842.)\r\n\r\n  11. Gleanings by the Way. By the Rev. John A. Clark, D.D. (352 pages\r\n  in 12mo, Philadelphia, 1842), Minister at Palmyra in New York at the\r\n  time when the New Faith arose.\r\n\r\n  12. The History of the Saints, or an Exposé of Joe Smith and\r\n  Mormonism. By John C. Bennett (344 pages, 12mo, Boston, 1842).\r\n  This is the work of a celebrated apostate, who for a season took a\r\n  prominent propagandist part in the political history of Mormondom.\r\n  Defeated in his hopes of dominion, he has revenged himself by\r\n  a volume whose title declares the character of its contents,\r\n  and which wants nothing but the confidence of the reader to be\r\n  highly interesting. The Mormons speak of him as the Musaylimat el\r\n  Kazzáb--Musaylimat the Liar, who tried, and failed to enter into\r\n  partnership with Mohammed--of their religion.\r\n\r\n  The four following works were written by the Rev. Henry Caswall, a\r\n  violent anti-Mormon, who solemnly and apparently honestly believes\r\n  all the calumnies against the “worthless family” of the Prophet;\r\n  unhesitatingly adopts the Solomon Spaulding story, discovers\r\n  in Mormon Scripture as many “anachronisms, contradictions, and\r\n  grammatical errors” as ever Celsus and Porphyry detected in the\r\n  writings of the early Christians, and designates the faith in which\r\n  hundreds of thousands live and die as a “delusion in some respects\r\n  worse than paganism, and a system destined perhaps to act like\r\n  Mohammedanism (!) as a scourge upon corrupted Christianity” (sub. the\r\n  American?). The Mormons speak of this gentleman as of a 19th century\r\n  Torquemada: he appears by his own evidence to have combined with\r\n  the heart of the great inquisitor some of the head qualities of Mr.\r\n  Coroner W---- when insisting upon the unhappy Fire-king’s swallowing\r\n  his (Mr. W.’s) prussic acid instead of the pseudo-poison provided for\r\n  the edification of the public. Mr. Caswall went to Nauvoo holding\r\n  in his hand an ancient MS. of the Greek Psalter, and completely,\r\n  according to his account, puzzled the Prophet, who decided it to\r\n  be “reformed Egyptian.” Moreover, he convicted of falsehood the\r\n  “wretched old creature,” viz., the maternal parent of Mr. Joseph\r\n  Smith, called a mother in Israel, looked upon as one of the holiest\r\n  of women, and who, at any rate, was a good and kind-hearted mother,\r\n  that could not be reproached, like Luther’s, with “chastising her son\r\n  so severely about a nut that the blood came.” It is no light proof of\r\n  Mormon tolerance that so truculent a divine and opponent _par voie de\r\n  fait_ should have been allowed to depart from among a people whom he\r\n  had offended and insulted without loss of liberty or life.\r\n\r\n  13. The City of the Mormons, or three Days in Nauvoo in 1842 (87\r\n  pages, Messrs. Rivingtons, London, 1843).\r\n\r\n  14. The Prophet of the 19th Century; or, the Rise, Progress, and\r\n  Present State of the Mormons (277 pages, 8vo, published by the same,\r\n  London, 1843).\r\n\r\n  15. Joseph Smith and the Mormons. Chapter xiii. of America and the\r\n  American Church (John and Charles Mozley, Paternoster Row, London,\r\n  1851).\r\n\r\n  16. Mormonism and its Author; or, a Statement of the Doctrines of the\r\n  Latter-Day Saints. London: Tract Society, No. 866 (16 pages, 1858).\r\n\r\n  17. Narrative of some of the Proceedings of the Mormons, giving an\r\n  Account of their Iniquities, with Particulars concerning the Training\r\n  of the Indians by them; Descriptions of their Mode of Endowment,\r\n  Plurality of Wives, &c. By Catharine Lewis Lynn (24 pages, 8vo,\r\n  1848). As will presently appear, when the fair sex enters upon the\r\n  subject of polygamy, it apparently loses all self-control, not to say\r\n  its senses.\r\n\r\n  18. Friendly Warnings on the Subject of Mormonism. By a Country\r\n  Clergyman (London, 1850).\r\n\r\n  19. The Mormon Imposture: an Exposure of the Fraudulent Origin of the\r\n  Book of Mormon (8vo, Newbury, London, 1851).\r\n\r\n  20. Mormonism Exposed. By Mr. Bowes. (1851.)\r\n\r\n  21. Mormonism or the Bible; a Question for the Times. By a Cambridge\r\n  Clergyman (12mo, Cambridge and London, 1852). According to Mormon\r\n  view, the title should have been Mormonism _and_ the Bible.\r\n\r\n  22. History of Illinois. By Governor Ford (Chicago, 1854). The author\r\n  was a determined opponent of the New Faith, and gives his own version\r\n  of the massacres at Carthage and Nauvoo: it is valuable only on the\r\n  venerable principle “audi alteram partem.”\r\n\r\n  23. Mormonism. By J. W. Conybeare, first printed in the “Edinburgh\r\n  Review” (No. ccii., April, 1854, and reprinted in 112 pages, 12mo, by\r\n  Messrs. Longman, London, 1854).\r\n\r\n  24. Utah and the Mormons; the History, Government, Doctrines,\r\n  Customs, and Prospects of the Latter-Day Saints, from Personal\r\n  Observations during a Six-months’ Residence at Great Salt Lake\r\n  City. By Benjamin G. Ferris, late Secretary of Utah Territory (347\r\n  pages, 12mo, Messrs. Harper, New York, 1854). The author being\r\n  married, appears to have lived among them to as little purpose--for\r\n  observation--as possible. Every thing is considered from an\r\n  anti-Mormon point of view, and some of the accusations against the\r\n  Saints, as in the case of the Eldridges and the Howards, I know to be\r\n  not founded on fact. The calmness of the work, upon a highly exciting\r\n  subject, contrasts curiously with the feminine violence--the natural\r\n  result of contemplating polygamy--of another that issued under the\r\n  same name.\r\n\r\n  25. Mormonism Unveiled; or, a History of Mormonism to the Present\r\n  Time (235 pages, 8vo, London, 1855).\r\n\r\n  26. Mormonism Examined: a few Kind Words to a Mormon (8vo,\r\n  Birmingham, 1855).\r\n\r\n  27. Female Life among the Mormons, published anonymously for the\r\n  demand of the New York market, and especially intended for the\r\n  followers of Miss Lucy Stone and of the Rev. Miss Antoinette Brown,\r\n  but known to be by Mrs. Maria Ward, who subsequently edited another\r\n  work. The authoress, who professes to have escaped from the Mormons,\r\n  was manifestly never among them. This “tissu de mensonges et de\r\n  calomnies,” as M. Remy somewhat ungallantly, but very truthfully\r\n  styles it, has had extensive currency. M. Révoil has given a free\r\n  translation of it, under the name of “Les Harems du Nouveau Monde”\r\n  (308 pages, Paris, 1856). Its success was such that its writeress was\r\n  in 1858 induced to repeat the experiment.\r\n\r\n  28. The Mormons at Home; in a Series of Letters, by Mrs. Ferris,\r\n  wife of the late United States Secretary for Utah Territory (Dix\r\n  and Edwards, Broadway, New York, 1856). The reasons for this lady’s\r\n  rabid hate may be found in polygamy, which is calculated to astound,\r\n  perplex, and enrage fair woman in America even more than her\r\n  strong-opinioned English sister, and in the somewhat contemptuous\r\n  estimation of a sex--which is early taught and soon learns to\r\n  consider itself creation’s cream--conveyed in these words of Mr.\r\n  Brigham Young: “If I did not consider myself competent to transact\r\n  business without asking my wife, or any other woman’s counsel, I\r\n  think I ought to let _that_ business alone.”\r\n\r\n  Accordingly, Mrs. Ferris finds herself in the hands and of a “society\r\n  of fanatics,” controlled by a “gang of licentious villains”--an\r\n  unpleasant predicament _pour cette vertu_--in fact, for virtue at any\r\n  time of life--characterizes the land as a “Botany Bay” for society in\r\n  general, and a “region of moral pestilence;” and while she lavishes\r\n  the treasures of her pity upon the “poor, poor wife,” holds her\r\n  spiritual rival to be _tout bonnement_ a “concubine,” and consigns\r\n  the wretches assembled here (_scil._ in Zion on the tops of the\r\n  Mountains) to the “very hottest part of the infernal torrid zone.”\r\n  Tantæne animis cœlestibus iræ?\r\n\r\n  The Mormons declare that they incurred this funny amount of feminine\r\n  wrath and suffered from its consequent pin-pricks by their not taking\r\n  sufficient interest in, or notice of the writer, especially by the\r\n  fact that on one occasion--it is made much of in the book--some\r\n  rude men actually did walk over a bridge before her. But coming\r\n  direct from the land of woman’s rights’ associations, lecturesses\r\n  on propagandism and voluntary celibatarians, whose “mission” it is\r\n  to reform, purify, and exalt the age, especially our wicked selves,\r\n  what else could be expected of outraged delicacy and self-esteem? Not\r\n  being “vivisectors,” we can not, however, quite join with Mrs. Ferris\r\n  in the complacency with which she relates her “probing the hearts” of\r\n  her Mormon guests and visitors “with ruthless questions” about their\r\n  domestic affairs; and we remark with pleasure that in more than one\r\n  place she has most unwillingly confessed the kindness and civility of\r\n  the Latter-Day Saints.\r\n\r\n  29. Adventures among the Mormons, by Elder Hawthornthwaite, an\r\n  Apostate Missionary. (1857.)\r\n\r\n  30. The Mormons, the Dream and the Reality; or, Leaves from the\r\n  Sketchbook of Experience. Edited by a Clergyman. W. B. F. (8vo,\r\n  London, 1857).\r\n\r\n  31. The Husband in Utah; or, Sights and Scenes among the Mormons. By\r\n  Austin N. Ward. Edited by Mrs. Maria Ward, Author of “Female Life\r\n  among the Mormons” (212 pages, 8vo, Derby and Jackson, Nassau Street,\r\n  New York, 1857). It is regretable that a respectable publisher should\r\n  lend his name to a volume like this. The authoress professes to\r\n  edit the MS. left by a nephew of her husband, who lived among the\r\n  Mormons en route to California, went on to the gold regions and died.\r\n  I can not but characterize it as a pure invention. The writer who\r\n  describes markets where not one ever existed, and “the tall spires\r\n  of the Mormon temples glittering in the rich sunlight” (p. 15),\r\n  there being no spires and no temples at Utah, can hardly expect to\r\n  be believed, even when, with all the eloquence of Mr. Potts, of the\r\n  “Eatanswill Gazette,” she dwells upon the “fanaticism and diabolism\r\n  that ever attends (?) the hideous and slimy course of Mormonism in\r\n  its progress over the world.” The imposture, too, is not “white;” it\r\n  is premeditatedly mischievous. Although Brother Underwood is a fancy\r\n  personage, Miss Eliza R. Snow, with whose name improper liberties are\r\n  taken, is no myth, but a well educated and highly respectable reality.\r\n\r\n  32. Fifteen Years among the Mormons, being the Narrative of Mrs. Mary\r\n  Ettie V. Smith, late of the Great Salt Lake City, a Sister of one\r\n  of the Mormon High-Priests, she having been personally acquainted\r\n  with most of the Mormon leaders, and long in the confidence of the\r\n  Prophet Brigham Young. By Nelson Winch Green. (Charles Scribner,\r\n  Broadway, New York, 1858, and unhappily republished by Messrs.\r\n  Routledge, London.) This work, whose exceedingly clap-trap title is\r\n  a key to the “popular” nature of the contents, is, _par excellence_,\r\n  _the_ most offensive publication of the kind, and bears within it\r\n  marks of an exceeding untruthfulness. The human sacrifices and the\r\n  abominable rites performed in the Endowment House are reproductions\r\n  of the accounts of hidden orgies in the Nauvoo Temple, invented\r\n  and promulgated by Mr. Bowes. The last words placed in the mouth\r\n  of Mr. Joseph Smith, “My God! my God! have mercy upon us, if there\r\n  is a God!”--a palpable plagiarism from Lord P----’s will--may be a\r\n  pious fraud to warn stray lambs from the fold of Mormonism, but as\r\n  a history shows, it is wholly destitute of fact. The murder in Mr.\r\n  Jones’, the butcher’s house, so circumstantially related, never took\r\n  place. Colonel Bridger, who is killed off by the Danites at the end\r\n  of the book, still lives; and a dream (ch. xxxviii.) seems to be the\r\n  only proof of Lieutenant Gunnison having been slaughtered by the\r\n  Latter-Day Saints, not, as is generally supposed, by the Indians.\r\n  “Milking the Gentiles,” coining “Bogus-money,” “whistling and\r\n  whittling” anti-Mormons out of the town, the dangers of competition\r\n  in love-matters with an apostle, and the imminent peril of being\r\n  scalped by white Indians, are stock accusations copied from book to\r\n  book, and rendered somewhat harmless by want of novelty. But nothing\r\n  will excuse the reckless accusations with which Mrs. Smith takes away\r\n  the characters of her Mormon sisters, and the abominations with which\r\n  she charges the wives of the highest dignitaries. Among those thus\r\n  foully defamed is Miss Snow, who also appears as a leading actress in\r\n  Mrs. Ward’s fiction. The “poetess of the Mormons,” now married to the\r\n  Prophet, has ever led a life of exceptional asceticism--cold in fact\r\n  as her name. The Latter-Day Saints retort upon Mrs. Smith, of course,\r\n  in kind, quoting Chaucer (but whether truthfully or not I can not\r\n  say):\r\n\r\n    “A woman she was the most discrete alive,\r\n    Husbandes at chirche-dore had she had five.”\r\n\r\n  33. Mormonism; its Leaders and Designs, by John Hyde, Jun.,\r\n  formerly a Mormon Elder, and resident of Great Salt Lake City.\r\n  (385 pages, 8vo, W. P. Fetridge & Co., Broadway, New York, 1857.)\r\n  This is the work of an apostate Mormon, now preaching, I believe,\r\n  Swedenborgianism in England: it has some pretensions to learning,\r\n  and it attacks the Mormons upon all their strongest grounds. It is\r\n  also satisfactory to see that in the circumstantial description of\r\n  the mysteries of the Endowment House, Mrs. Smith and Mr. Hyde, whose\r\n  account has apparently been borrowed by M. Remy, disagree, thus\r\n  justifying us in doubting both; and it is curious to remark, that\r\n  while the lady leans to the erotic, the gentleman dwells upon the\r\n  treasonous and mutinous tendency of the ceremony. According to Mr.\r\n  Hyde, he left the Mormons from conscientious motives. The Mormons,\r\n  who, however, never fail thoroughly to denigrate the character of\r\n  an enemy, especially of an apostate, declare that the author, when\r\n  a missionary at Havre de Grâce, proved useless, always shirking his\r\n  duty; and that, since dismissal from the ministry, he has left a wife\r\n  unprovided for at Great Salt Lake City.\r\n\r\n  The now almost forgotten polemical and anti-Mormon works are,\r\n\r\n  M.

The “Revue” had already undertaken the subject in the\r\n  number of the 1st of September, 1853, the 15th of February, 1856, and\r\n  the 1st of September, 1859.\r\n\r\n  The foreign works omitted in the catalogue at the end of this note\r\n  are,\r\n\r\n  Mormonismen och Swedenborgianismen.

Dresden, 1859.\r\n\r\n  The Mormons have published at their General Repository only one\r\n  purely laical book, “The Route from Liverpool to Great Salt Lake\r\n  Valley,” illustrated with steel engravings and wood-cuts, from\r\n  sketches made by Frederick Piercy. Edited by James Linworth. It is a\r\n  highly creditable volume, especially in the artistic department, but\r\n  the letter-press is uninteresting, and appears a mere peg upon which\r\n  to hang copious notes and official returns. The price varies from\r\n  £1 to £1 3_s._, and the three first parts, containing an accurate\r\n  history of the Latter-Day Saints’ emigration from Europe up to 1854,\r\n  may be had separately, 1_s._ each.\r\n\r\n  So good a theme for romance could not fail to fall into the hands\r\n  of Captain Mayne Reid, who is to Mormonism what Alexander Dumas\r\n  was to Mesmerism. In his pages the exaggerated anti-Mormon feeling\r\n  attains its acme; the explorer Stansbury, who spoke fairly of the\r\n  Saints, is thus qualified: “the captain is at best but a superficial\r\n  observer”--quite a glass-house stone-throwing critique. Mr. Brigham\r\n  Young is a “vulgar Alcibiades;” the City of the Saints is a “modern\r\n  Gomorrah,” and the Saints themselves are “sanctified _forbans_;” the\r\n  plurality wife is a “_femme entretenue_.” In the tale of the “Wild\r\n  Huntress,” a young person married by foul means to Josh. Stebbing,\r\n  the Mormon, and rescued mainly by a young hero--of course a Mexican\r\n  volunteer--we have a sound abuse of the many-wife-system, despotism,\r\n  theocracy, Danites, tithes, “plebbishness,” and the “vulgar ring\r\n  which smacks (!) of ignoble origin.” On the other hand, the rascal\r\n  Wakara, an ignoble sub-chief of the Yutas, known mainly as a\r\n  horse-thief, contrasts splendidly by his valor, by his “delicate\r\n  attentions” to the pretty half-caste, and by his chivalry and\r\n  hospitality, which make him a very “Rolla of the North!” And this is\r\n  “fact taught through fiction!”\r\n\r\n  The Mormon Scriptures, corresponding with the Old Testament, the\r\n  Evangels, and the epistles of Christianity, consist of the following\r\n  works: purely bibliographical notices are here given; the contents\r\n  will be the subject of a future page.\r\n\r\n  1. The Book of Mormon, an Account written by the hand of Mormon, upon\r\n  plates taken from the Plates of Mormon. Translated by Joseph Smith,\r\n  Jun. The first edition was printed in 1830, at Palmyra, New York,\r\n  and consisted of 5000 copies. Since that time it has frequently been\r\n  republished in England and America: it was translated into French in\r\n  1852 (Marc Ducloux, Rue Saint Benoît 7, Paris, 1852), and versions\r\n  have appeared in the German, Italian, Danish, Welsh, and Hawaïan\r\n  tongues.\r\n\r\n  2. The Book of Doctrine and Covenants of the Church of Jesus of\r\n  Latter-Day Saints, selected (!) from the Revelations of God. By\r\n  Joseph Smith, President (336 pages, 12mo). The first American edition\r\n  was printed in 1832, or ten years after the Book of Mormon, and was\r\n  published at Mr. Joseph Smith’s expense. Many translations of this\r\n  important work have appeared.\r\n\r\n  3. The Pearl of Great Price; being a Choice Selection from the\r\n  Revelations, Translations, and Narratives of Joseph Smith (56\r\n  pages, 8vo, Liverpool, first published in 1851). This little volume\r\n  contains the Book of Abraham, “translated from some records that have\r\n  fallen into our hands from the catacombs of Egypt, purporting to be\r\n  the writings of Abraham while he was in Egypt, called the Book of\r\n  Abraham, written by his own hand on papyrus. With a fac-simile of\r\n  three papyri.”\r\n\r\n  4. The Latter-Day Saints’ Millennial Star, begun in 1839, Manchester,\r\n  United States, and now published 42 Islington, Liverpool, every\r\n  Saturday. It has reached its 21st volume. The periodical is a single\r\n  sheet (16 pages), and the price is one penny. It is an important\r\n  publication, embracing the whole history of Mormonism; the hebdomadal\r\n  issue now contains polemical papers, vindications of the Faith, with\r\n  a kind of appendix, such as emigration reports, quarterly lists of\r\n  marriages and deaths, varieties, and money lists.\r\n\r\n  5. Journal of Discourses by Brigham Young and others. First published\r\n  in 1854 (8vo, Liverpool). It now appears in semi-monthly numbers,\r\n  1st and 15th, costing 2_d._, making up one volume per annum. The\r\n  above-mentioned and the writings of “Joseph the Seer and Parley P.\r\n  Pratt, wherever found,” are considered by the authorities of the\r\n  Church as direct revelations.\r\n\r\n  The Mormons do not hold the “Biographical Sketches of Joseph Smith\r\n  the Prophet and his Progenitors, for many Generations, by Lucy Smith,\r\n  mother of the Prophet,” to be entirely trustworthy. Beyond its two\r\n  pages of preface by Orson Pratt, it is deep below criticism. This\r\n  work, 18mo, of 297 pages (including “Elegies” by Miss E. R. Snow),\r\n  was first printed in 1853.\r\n\r\n  The Controversialist works, not usually included in the London\r\n  catalogue, are the following. They are characterized by abundant\r\n  earnestness and enthusiasm, and are purposely written in a style\r\n  intelligible to the classes addressed:\r\n\r\n  The Word of our Lord to the Citizens of London, by H. C. Kimball and\r\n  W. Woodruff (1839).\r\n\r\n  The Millennium, and other Poems; to which is annexed a Treatise on\r\n  the Regeneration and Eternal Duration of Matter, by Parley P. Pratt,\r\n  New York, 1840.\r\n\r\n  A Cry out of the Wilderness, by Elder Hyde. This hook was first\r\n  published in Germany and in German (120 pages, in 1842).\r\n\r\n  Three Nights’ Public Discourse at Boulogne-sur-Mer, by Elder John\r\n  Taylor (46 pages in 8vo, Liverpool, 1850).\r\n\r\n  Three Letters to the “New York Herald,” of James Gordon Bennett,\r\n  Esq., from J. M. Grant (Mayor and President of the Quorum of\r\n  Seventies), of Utah, March, 1852. These epistles have been reprinted\r\n  in pamphlet form; they chiefly set forth Mormon grievances,\r\n  especially the injury done by the federal officials.\r\n\r\n  History of the Persecutions endured by the Church of Jesus of\r\n  Latter-Day Saints in America, compiled from Public Documents and\r\n  drawn from Authentic Sources, by C.

I shall\r\n  presently quote this curious work.\r\n\r\n  Acts and Resolutions of the Legislative Assembly of the Territory of\r\n  Utah, Great Salt Lake City, 40 pages, 12mo. First printed in 1854,\r\n  and now published for every Annual Session (that of ’60-’61 being the\r\n  10th) at Great Salt Lake City. Printed at the “Mountaineer” Office,\r\n  by John S. Davis, Public Printer.\r\n\r\n  Acts, Resolutions, and Memorials passed at the several Annual\r\n  Sessions (the 9th in 1859-60) of the Legislative Assembly of the\r\n  Territory of Utah. Published by virtue of an Act approved January\r\n  19th, 1855, Great Salt Lake City, Joseph Cain, afterward J. S.\r\n  Davis, Public Printer, 1855-1860. 460 pages, 12mo.

Livingston, Bell, and Co.--formerly Livingston\r\nand Kinkhead--the sutlers of Camp Floyd, and the most considerable\r\nGentile merchants in Great Salt Lake City; he to learn the readiest\r\nway of reaching head-quarters, I to make inquiries about the San\r\nFrancisco road. We were cordially received by both these gentlemen,\r\nwho, during the whole period of my stay, did all in their power to\r\nmake the place pleasant. Governor Bell, as he is generally called,\r\npresently introduced me to his wife, a very charming person, of English\r\ndescent, whose lively manners contrasted strongly and agreeably with\r\nthe almost monastic gloom which the _régime_ of the “lady-saints” casts\r\nover society. Lieutenant Dana was offered seats in Mr. Livingston’s\r\ntrotting-wagon on the ensuing Monday. I was less fortunate. Captain\r\nMiller, of Millersville, the principal agent and director at this end\r\nof the road, informed me that he had lately ceased to run the wagon,\r\nwhich had cost the company $15,000 a month, returning but $30,000 per\r\nannum, and was sending the mails on mule-back. However, my informants\r\nagreed that a party would probably be starting soon, and that, all\r\nthings failing, I could ride the road, though with some little risk of\r\nscalp. We ended with a bottle of Heidseck, and with cigars which were\r\nnot unpleasant even after the excellent “gold-leaf tobacco” of the\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n[GOVERNOR CUMMING.]\r\n\r\nOn the next day, Sunday, we walked up the main street northward, and\r\ndoubling three corners of Temple Block, reached the large adobe house,\r\nwith its neat garden, the abode of the then governor, Hon. Alfred\r\nCumming. This gentleman, a Georgian by birth, after a long public\r\nservice as Indian agent in the northern country, was, after several\r\nrefusals, persuaded by the then president, who knew his high honor\r\nand tried intrepidity, to assume the supreme executive authority at\r\nGreat Salt Lake City. The conditions were that polygamy should not be\r\ninterfered with, nor forcible measures resorted to except in extremest\r\nneed. Governor Cumming, accompanied by his wife, and an escort of 600\r\ndragoons, left the Mississippi in the autumn of 1857, at a time when\r\nthe Mormons were in arms against the federal authority, and ended his\r\njourney only in April of the ensuing year. By firmness, prudence, and\r\nconciliation, he not only prevented any collision between the local\r\nmilitia and the United States army, which was burning to revenge\r\nitself for the terrible hardships of the campaign, but succeeded in\r\nrestoring order and obedience throughout the Territory. He had been\r\ntold before entering that his life was in danger; he was not, however,\r\na man to be deterred from a settled purpose, and experiment showed\r\nthat, so far from being molested, he was received with a salute and\r\nall the honors. Having been warned that he might share the fate of\r\nGovernor Boggs, who in 1843 was shot through the mouth when standing\r\nat the window, he enlarged the casements of his house in order to give\r\nthe shooter a fair chance. His determination enabled him to issue, a\r\nfew days after his arrival, a proclamation offering protection to all\r\npersons illegally restrained of their liberty in Utah. The scrupulous\r\nand conscientious impartiality which he has brought to the discharge of\r\nhis difficult and delicate duties, and, more still, his resolution to\r\ntreat the Saints like Gentiles and citizens, not as Digger Indians or\r\nfelons, have won him scant favor from either party. The anti-Mormons\r\nuse very hard language, and declare him to be a Mormon in Christian\r\ndisguise. The Mormons, though more moderate, can never, by their very\r\norganization, rest contented without the combination of the temporal\r\nwith the spiritual power. The governor does not meet his predecessor,\r\nthe ex-governor, Mr. Brigham Young, from prudential motives, except\r\non public duty. Mrs. Cumming visits Mrs. Young, and at the houses of\r\nthe principal dignitaries, this being nearly the only society in the\r\nplace. As, among Moslems, a Lady M. W. Montague can learn more of\r\ndomestic life in a week than a man can in a year, so it is among the\r\nMormons. I can not but express a hope that the amiable Mrs. Cumming\r\nwill favor us with the results of her observation and experience, and\r\nthat she will be as disinterested and unprejudiced as she is talented\r\nand accomplished. The kindness and hospitality which I found at the\r\ngovernor’s, and, indeed, at every place in New Zion, is “ungrateful to\r\nomit,” and would be “tedious to repeat.”\r\n\r\nWe dined with his excellency at the usual hour, 2 P.M. On the way I\r\ncould dwell more observantly upon the main features of the city, which,\r\nafter the free use of the pocket-compass, were becoming familiar to me.\r\nThe first remark was, that every meridional street is traversed on both\r\nsides by a streamlet of limpid water, verdure-fringed, and gurgling\r\nwith a murmur which would make a Persian Moollah long for improper\r\ndrinks. The supplies are brought in raised and hollowed water-courses\r\nfrom City Creek, Red Buttes, and other kanyons lying north and east\r\nof the settlement. The few wells are never less than forty-five feet\r\ndeep; artesians have been proposed for the benches, but the expense\r\nhas hitherto proved an obstacle. Citizens can now draw with scanty\r\ntrouble their drinking water in the morning, when it is purest, from\r\nthe clear and sparkling streams that flow over the pebbly beds before\r\ntheir doors. The surplus is reserved for the purposes of irrigation,\r\nwithout which, as the “distillation from above” will not suffice,\r\nDeserét would still be a desert, and what is not wanted swells the City\r\nCreek, and eventually the waves of the Jordan. The element, which flows\r\nat about the rate of four miles an hour, is under a chief water-master\r\nor commissioner, assisted by a water-master in each ward, and by a\r\ndeputy in each block, all sworn to see the fertilizing fluid fairly\r\ndistributed. At the corners of every ward there is a water-gate which\r\ncontrols the supplies that branch off to the several blocks, and each\r\nlot of one and a quarter acres is allowed about three hours’ irrigation\r\nduring the week. For repairs and other expenses a property tax of one\r\nmill per dollar is raised, and the total of the impost in 1860 was\r\n$1163 25. The system works like clock-work. “The Act to Incorporate the\r\nGreat Salt Lake City Water-works” was approved January 21, 1853.\r\n\r\n[THE HOLY CITY.]\r\n\r\nWalking in a northward direction up Main, otherwise called Whisky\r\nStreet, we could not but observe the “magnificent distances” of the\r\nsettlement, which, containing 9000-12,000 souls, covers an area of\r\nthree miles. This broadway is 132 feet wide, including the side-walks,\r\nwhich are each twenty, and, like the rest of the principal avenues, is\r\nplanted with locust and other trees. There are twenty or twenty-one\r\nwards or cantons, numbered from the S.E. “boustrophedon” to the N.W.\r\ncorner. They have a common fence and a bishop apiece. They are called\r\nafter the creeks, trees, people, or positions, as Mill-Creek Ward,\r\nLittle Cotton-wood, Denmark, and South Ward. Every ward contains about\r\nnine blocks, each of which is forty rods square. The area of ten acres\r\nis divided into four to eight lots, of two and a half to one and a\r\nquarter acres each, 264 feet by 132. A city ordinance places the houses\r\ntwenty feet behind the front line of the lot, leaving an intermediate\r\nplace for shrubbery or trees. This rule, however, is not observed in\r\nMain Street.\r\n\r\nThe streets are named from their direction to the Temple Block. Thus\r\nMain Street is East Temple Street No. 1; that behind it is State Road,\r\nor East Temple Street 2, and so forth, the ward being also generally\r\nspecified. Temple Block is also the point to which latitude and\r\nlongitude are referred. It lies in N. lat. 40° 45′ 44″, W. long. (G.)\r\n112° 6′ 8″, and 4300 feet above sea level.\r\n\r\nMain Street is rapidly becoming crowded. The western block, opposite\r\nthe hotel, contains about twenty houses of irregular shape and\r\nsize. The buildings are intended to supply the principal wants of\r\na far-Western settlement, as bakery, butchery, and blacksmithery,\r\nhardware and crockery, paint and whip warehouse, a “fashionable\r\ntailor”--and “fashionable” in one point, that his works are more\r\nexpensive than Poole’s--shoe-stores, tannery and curriery; the\r\nPantechnicon, on a more pretentious style than its neighbors, kept\r\nby Mr. Gilbert Clements, Irishman and orator; dry-goods, groceries,\r\nliquors, and furniture shops, Walker’s agency, and a kind of restaurant\r\nfor ice-cream, a luxury which costs 25 cents a glass; saddlers, dealers\r\nin “food, flour, and provisions,” hats, shoes, clothing, sash laths,\r\nshingles, timber, copper, tin, crockery-ware, carpenters’ tools, and\r\nmouse-traps; a watch-maker and repairer, a gunsmith, locksmith, and\r\narmorer, soap and candle maker, nail-maker, and venders of “Yankee\r\nnotions.” On the eastern side, where the same articles are sold on a\r\nlarger scale, live the principal Gentile merchants, Mr. Gilbert and\r\nMr. Nixon, an English Saint; Mr. R. Gill, a “physiological barber;”\r\nMr. Godbe’s “apothecary and drug stores;” Goddard’s confectionery;\r\nMessrs. Hockaday and Burr, general dealers, who sell every thing, from\r\na bag of potatoes to a yard of gold lace; and various establishments,\r\nMormon and others. Crossing the street that runs east and west, we pass\r\non the right hand a small block, occupied by Messrs. Dyer and Co.,\r\nsutlers to a regiment in Arizona, and next to it the stores of Messrs.\r\nHooper and Cronyn, with an ambrotype and daguerrean room behind. The\r\nstores, I may remark, are far superior, in all points, to the shops in\r\nan English country town that is not a regular watering-place. Beyond\r\nthis lies the adobe house, with its wooden Ionic stoop or piazza\r\n(the portico is a favorite here), and well-timbered garden, occupied\r\nby Bishop Hunter; and adjoining it the long tenement inhabited by\r\nthe several relicts of Mayor Jedediah M. Grant. Farther still, and\r\nfacing the Prophet’s Block, is the larger adobe house belonging to\r\nGeneral Wells and his family. Opposite, or on the western side, is\r\nthe well-known store of Livingston, Bell, and Co., and beyond it the\r\nestablishment now belonging to the nine widows and the son of the\r\nmurdered apostle, Parley P. Pratt. Still looking westward, the Globe\r\nbakery and restaurant, and a shaving saloon, lead to the “Mountaineer\r\nOffice,” a conspicuous building, forty-five feet square, two storied,\r\non a foundation of cut stone stuccoed red to resemble sandstone, and\r\nprovided with a small green-balconied belvidere. The cost was $20,000.\r\nIt was formerly the Council House, and was used for church purposes.\r\nWhen purchased by the Territory the Public Library was established in\r\nthe northern part; the office of the “Deserét News” on the first story,\r\nand that of the “Mountaineer” on the ground floor. This brings us to\r\nthe 1st South Temple Street, which divides the “Mountaineer” office\r\nfrom the consecrated ground. In this vicinity are the houses of most of\r\nthe apostles, Messrs. Taylor, Cannon, Woodruff, and O. Pratt.\r\n\r\nCrowds were flocking into Temple Block for afternoon service; yet\r\nI felt disappointed by the scene. I had expected to see traces of\r\n“workmen in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all\r\nmanner of cunning men for every manner of work,” reposing from their\r\nlabors on the Sabbath. I thought, at any rate, to find\r\n\r\n                            “pars ducere muros\r\n    Molirique arcem, et manibus subvolvere saxa.”\r\n\r\nIt seemed hardly in accordance with the energy and devotedness of a new\r\nfaith that a hole in the ground should represent the House of the Lord,\r\nwhile Mr. Brigham Young, the Prophet, thinking of his own comfort\r\nbefore the glory of God, is lodged, like Solomon of old, in what here\r\nappears a palace. Nor, reflecting that without a Temple the dead can\r\nnot be baptized out of Purgatory, was I quite satisfied when reminded\r\nof the fate of Nauvoo (according to Gentiles the Mormons believe that\r\nthey must build nine temples before they will be suffered to worship\r\nin peace), and informed that the purely provisional works, which had\r\nbeen interrupted by the arrival of the army in 1858, would shortly be\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\n[THE TEMPLE BLOCK.]\r\n\r\nThe lines of Temple Block--which, as usual, is ten acres square =\r\nforty rods each way--run toward the cardinal points. It stands clear\r\nof all other buildings, and the locust-trees, especially those on\r\nthe sunny south side, which have now been planted seven years, will\r\ngreatly add to its beauties. It is surrounded with a foundation wall\r\nof handsomely dressed red sandstone, raised to the height of ten feet\r\nby adobe stuccoed over to resemble a richer material. Each facing has\r\nthirty flat pilastres, without pedestal or entablature, but protected,\r\nas the adobe always should be, by a sandstone coping. When finished,\r\nthe whole will be surmounted by an ornamental iron fence. There are\r\nfour gates, one to each side--of these, two, the northern and western,\r\nare temporarily blocked up with dry stone walls, while the others are\r\nleft open--which in time will become carriage entrances, with two side\r\nways for foot passengers. According to accounts, the wall and the\r\nfoundations have already cost one million of dollars, or a larger sum\r\nthan that spent upon the entire Nauvoo Temple.\r\n\r\nTemple Block--the only place of public and general worship in the\r\ncity--was consecrated and a Tabernacle was erected in September,\r\n1847, immediately after the celebrated exodus from “Egypt on the\r\nbanks of the Mississippi,” on a spot revealed by the past to the\r\npresent Prophet and his adherents. Two sides of the wall having been\r\ncompleted, ground was broken on the 14th of February, 1853, for the\r\nfoundation of the building. One part of the ceremony consisted of\r\nplanting a post at the central point, the main “stake for the curtains\r\nof Zion:” every successive step in advance was commemorated by imposing\r\nceremonies, salvos of guns, bands playing, crowds attending, addresses\r\nby the governor, Mr. Brigham Young, prayers and pious exercises. The\r\nfoundations of the Temple, which are sixteen feet deep, and composed of\r\nhard gray granite, in color like that of Aberdeen or Quincy, are now\r\nconcealed from view; and the lumber huts erected for the workmen were,\r\nwhen the Mormons made their minor Hegira to Provo City, removed to the\r\nSugar-house Ward, three miles southeast of the city.\r\n\r\nThe Temple Block is at present a mere waste. A central excavation,\r\nwhich resembles a large oblong grave, is said by Gentiles to be the\r\nbeginning of a baptismal font twenty feet deep. The southwestern corner\r\nis occupied by the Tabernacle, an adobe building 126 feet long from\r\nN. to S., and 64 wide from E. to W.: its interior, ceilinged with an\r\nelliptical arch--the width being its span--can accommodate 2000-3000\r\nsouls. It urgently requires enlarging. Over the entrances at the gable\r\nends, which open to the N. and S., is a wood-work representing the\r\nsun, with his usual coiffure of yellow beams, like a Somali’s wig, or\r\nthe symbol of the Persian empire. The roof is of shingles: it shelters\r\nunder its projecting eaves a whole colony of swallows, and there are\r\nfour chimneys--a number insufficient for warmth at one season, or\r\nfor ventilation at the other. The speaker or preacher stands on the\r\nwest side of the building, which is reserved for the three highest\r\ndignities, viz., the First Presidency, the “Twelve” (Apostles), and\r\nthe President of the State of Zion: distinguished strangers are also\r\nadmitted. Of late, as in the old Quaker meeting-houses at Philadelphia,\r\nthe brethren in the Tabernacle have been separated from the “sistern,”\r\nwho sit on the side opposite the preacher’s left; and, according to\r\nGentiles, it is proposed to separate the Christians from the Faithful,\r\nthat the “goats” may no longer mingle with the sheep.\r\n\r\nImmediately north of the Tabernacle is the Bowery--in early spring\r\na canopy of green leafy branches, which are left to wither with the\r\nyear, supported on wooden posts. The interior will be described when we\r\nattend the house of worship next Sunday.\r\n\r\nIn the extreme northwest angle of the block is the Endowment, here\r\npronounced _On-dewment House_, separated from the Tabernacle by a high\r\nwooden paling. The building, of which I made a pen and ink sketch\r\nfrom the west, is of adobe, with a pent roof and four windows, one\r\nblocked up: the central and higher portion is flanked by two wings,\r\nsmaller erections of the same shape. The Endowment House is the place\r\nof great medicine, and all appertaining to it is carefully concealed\r\nfrom Gentile eyes and ears: the result is that human sacrifices are\r\nsaid to be performed within its walls. Mrs. Smith and Mr. Hyde have\r\ndescribed the mysterious rites performed within these humble walls,\r\nbut, for reasons given before, there is reason to doubt the truth of\r\ntheir descriptions; such orgies as they describe could not coexist with\r\nthe respectability which is the law of the land. M. Remy has detailed\r\nthe programme with all the exactitude of an eye-witness, which he was\r\nnot. The public declare that the ceremonies consist of some show,\r\nwhich in the Middle Ages would be called a comedy or mystery--possibly\r\nParadise Lost and Paradise Regained--and connect it with the working\r\nof a mason’s lodge. The respectable Judge Phelps, because supposed to\r\ntake the place of the Father of Sin when tempting Adam and Eve, is\r\npopularly known as “the Devil.” The two small wings are said to contain\r\nfonts for the two sexes, where baptism by total immersion is performed.\r\nAccording to Gentiles, the ceremony occupies eleven or twelve hours.\r\nThe neophyte, after bathing, is anointed with oil, and dressed in\r\nclean white cotton garments, cap and shirt, of which the latter is\r\nrarely removed--Dr. Richards saved his life at the Carthage massacre by\r\nwearing it--and a small square masonic apron, with worked or painted\r\nfig-leaves: he receives a new name and a distinguishing grip, and\r\nis bound to secrecy by dreadful oaths. Moreover, it is said that,\r\nas in all such societies, there are several successive degrees, all\r\nof which are not laid open to initiation till the Temple shall be\r\nfinished. But--as every mason knows--the “red-hot poker” and other\r\nideas concerning masonic institutions have prevailed when juster\r\ndisclosures have been rejected. Similarly in the Mormonic mystery, it\r\nis highly probable that, in consequence of the conscientious reserve of\r\nthe people upon a subject which it would be indelicate to broach, the\r\nveriest fancies have taken the deepest root.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENDOWMENT HOUSE AND TABERNACLE. (From the West.)]\r\n\r\n[THE FUTURE TEMPLE.]\r\n\r\nThe other features of the inclosure are a well near the Tabernacle,\r\nan arched sewer in the western wall for drainage, and at the eastern\r\nentrance a small habitation for concierge and guards. The future Temple\r\nwas designed by an Anglo-Mormon architect, Mr. Truman O. Angell. The\r\nplan is described at full length in the Latter-Day Saints’ “Millennial\r\nStar,” December 2, 1854, and drawings, apparently copied from the\r\noriginal in the historian’s office, have been published at Liverpool,\r\nbesides the small sketches in the works of Mr. Hyde and M. Remy. It is\r\nhardly worth while here to trouble the general reader with a lengthy\r\ndescription of a huge and complicated pile, a syncretism of Greek\r\nand Roman, Gothic and Moorish, not revealed like that of Nauvoo, but\r\nplanned by man, which will probably never be completed. It has been\r\ntransferred to the Appendix (No. II.), for the benefit of students:\r\nafter briefly saying that the whole is symbolical, and that it is\r\nintended to dazzle, by its ineffable majesty, the beholder’s sight, I\r\nwill repeat the architect’s concluding words, which are somewhat in the\r\nstyle of Parr’s Life Pills advertisements: “For other particulars, wait\r\ntill the house is done, then come and see it.”\r\n\r\n[MR. STENHOUSE.]\r\n\r\nAfter dining with the governor, we sat under the stoop enjoying, as we\r\nmight in India, the cool of the evening. Several visitors dropped in,\r\namong them Mr. and Mrs. Stenhouse. He--Elder T. B. H. Stenhouse--is\r\na Scotchman by birth, and has passed through the usual stages of\r\nneophyte (larva), missionary (pupa), and elder or fully-developed\r\nSaint (imago). Madame was from Jersey, spoke excellent French, talked\r\nEnglish without nasalization or cantalenation, and showed a highly\r\ncultivated mind. She had traveled with her husband on a propagandist\r\ntour to Switzerland and Italy, where, as president of the missions\r\nfor three years, he was a “diligent and faithful laborer in the great\r\nwork of the last dispensation.” He became a Saint in 1846, at the\r\nage of 21; lived the usual life of poverty and privation, founded\r\nthe Southampton Conference, converted a lawyer among other great\r\nachievements, and propagated the Faith successfully in Scotland as in\r\nEngland. The conversation turned--somehow in Great Salt Lake City it\r\ngenerally does--upon polygamy, or rather plurality, which here is the\r\npolite word, and for the first time I heard that phase of the family\r\ntie sensibly, nay, learnedly advocated on religious grounds by fair\r\nlips. Mr. Stenhouse kindly offered to accompany me on the morrow, as\r\nthe first hand-cart train was expected to enter, and to point out what\r\nmight be interesting. I saw Elder and High-Priest Stenhouse almost\r\nevery day during my stay at Great Salt Lake City, and found in his\r\nsociety both pleasure and profit. We of course avoided those mysterious\r\npoints, into which, as an outsider, I had no right to enter; the\r\nelder was communicative enough upon all others, and freely gave me\r\nleave to use his information. The reader, however, will kindly bear\r\nin mind that, being a strict Mormon, Mr. Stenhouse could enlighten\r\nme only upon one side of the subject; his statements were therefore\r\ncarefully referred to the “other part;” moreover, as he could never\r\nsee any but the perfections of his system, the blame of having pointed\r\nout what I deem its imperfections is not to be charged upon him. His\r\npower of faith struck me much. I had once asked him what became of the\r\nMormon Tables of the Law, the Golden Plates which, according to the\r\nGentiles, were removed by an angel after they had done their work. He\r\nreplied that he knew not; that his belief was independent of all such\r\naccidents; that Mormonism is and must be true to the exclusion of all\r\nother systems. I saw before me an instance how the brain or mind of man\r\ncan, by mere force of habit and application, imbue itself with any idea.\r\n\r\nLong after dark I walked home alone. There were no lamps in any but\r\nMain Street, yet the city is as safe as at St. James’s Square, London.\r\nThere are perhaps not more than twenty-five or thirty constables or\r\npolicemen in the whole place, under their captain, a Scotchman, Mr.\r\nSharp, “by name as well as nature so;” and the guard on public works\r\nis merely nominal. Its excellent order must be referred to the perfect\r\nsystem of private police, resulting from the constitution of Mormon\r\nsociety, which in this point resembles the caste system of Hindooism.\r\nThere is no secret from the head of the Church and State; every\r\nthing, from the highest to the lowest detail of private and public\r\nlife, must be brought to the ear and submitted to the judgment of the\r\nfather-confessor-in-chief. Gentiles often declare that the Prophet is\r\nacquainted with their every word half an hour after it is spoken; and\r\nfrom certain indices, into which I hardly need enter, my opinion is\r\nthat, allowing something for exaggeration, they are not very far wrong.\r\nIn London and Paris the foreigner is subjected, though perhaps he may\r\nnot know it, to the same surveillance, and till lately his letters were\r\nliable to be opened at the Post-office. We can not, then, wonder that\r\nat Great Salt Lake City, a stranger, before proving himself at the\r\nleast to be harmless, should begin by being an object of suspicion.\r\n\r\n[A MURDER.--SAFETY OF THE CITY.]\r\n\r\nOn Monday, as the sun was sloping toward the east, Mr. Stenhouse called\r\nto let me know that the train had already issued from Emigration\r\nKanyon; no time to spare. We set out together “down town” at once.\r\nNear the angle of Main Street I was shown the place where a short\r\ntime before my arrival a curious murder was committed. Two men, named\r\nJohnston and Brown, _mauvais sujets_, who had notoriously been guilty\r\nof forgery and horse-stealing, were sauntering home one fine evening,\r\nwhen both fell with a bullet to each, accurately placed under the\r\nheart-arm. The bodies were carried to the court-house, which is here\r\nthe morgue or dead-house, to be exposed, as is the custom, for a time:\r\nthe citizens, when asked if they suspected who did the deed, invariably\r\nreplied, with a philosophical _sangfroid_, that, in the first place,\r\nthey didn’t know, and, secondly, that they didn’t care. Of course the\r\nGentiles hinted that life had been taken by “counsel”--that is to say,\r\nby the secret orders of Mr. Brigham Young and his Vehm. But, even\r\nhad such been the case--of course it was the merest suspicion--such\r\na process would not have been very repugnant to that wild huntress,\r\nthe Themis of the Rocky Mountains. In a place where, among much that\r\nis honest and respectable, there are notable exceptions, this wild,\r\nunflinching, and unerring justice, secret and sudden, is the rod of\r\niron which protects the good. During my residence at the Mormon City\r\nnot a single murder was, to the best of my belief, committed: the three\r\ndays which I spent at Christian Carson City witnessed three. Moreover,\r\nfrom the Mississippi to Great Salt Lake City, I noticed that the crimes\r\nwere for the most part of violence, openly and unskillfully committed;\r\nthe arsenic, strychnine, and other dastardly poisonings of Europe are\r\napparently unknown, although they might be used easily and efficiently\r\nwith scant chance of detection. That white emigrants have sometimes\r\nwiped off the Indian, as the English settler settled with corrosive\r\nsublimate the hapless denizen of the great Southern Continent, is\r\nscarcely to be doubted; at the same time, it must be owned that they\r\nhave rarely tried that form of assassination upon one another.\r\n\r\nAs we issued from the city, we saw the smoke-like column which\r\nannounced that the emigrants were crossing the bench-land; and people\r\nwere hurrying from all sides to greet and to get news of friends.\r\nPresently the carts came. All the new arrivals were in clean clothes,\r\nthe men washed and shaved, and the girls, who were singing hymns,\r\nhabited in Sunday dresses. The company was sunburned, but looked\r\nwell and thoroughly happy, and few, except the very young and the\r\nvery old, who suffer most on such journeys, troubled the wains. They\r\nmarched through clouds of dust over the sandy road leading up the\r\neastern portion of the town, accompanied by crowds, some on foot,\r\nothers on horseback, and a few in traps and other “locomotive doin’s,”\r\nsulkies, and buckboards. A few youths of rather a rowdyish appearance\r\nwere mounted in all the tawdriness of Western trappings--Rocky\r\nMountain hats, tall and broad, or steeple-crowned felts, covering\r\ntheir scalp-locks, embroidered buckskin garments, huge leggins, with\r\ncaterpillar or millepede fringes, red or rainbow-colored flannel\r\nshirts, gigantic spurs, bright-hilted pistols, and queer-sheathed\r\nknives stuck in red sashes with gracefully depending ends. The\r\n_jeunesse dorée_ of the Valley Tan was easily distinguished from\r\nimported goods by the perfect ease with which they sat and managed\r\ntheir animals. Around me were all manner of familiar faces--heavy\r\nEnglish mechanics, discharged soldiers, clerks, and agricultural\r\nlaborers, a few German students, farmers, husbandmen, and peasants from\r\nScandinavia and Switzerland, and correspondents and editors, bishops,\r\napostles, and other dignitaries from the Eastern States. When the train\r\nreached the public square--at Great Salt Lake City the “squares” are\r\nhollow as in England, not solid as in the States--of the 8th ward, the\r\nwagons were ranged in line for the final ceremony. Before the invasion\r\nof the army the First President made a point of honoring the entrance\r\nof hand-cart trains (but these only) by a greeting in person. Of late\r\nhe seldom leaves his house except for the Tabernacle: when inclined\r\nfor a picnic, the day and the hour are kept secret. It is said that\r\nMr. Brigham Young, despite his powerful will and high moral courage,\r\ndoes not show the remarkable personal intrepidity of Mr. Joseph Smith:\r\nhis followers deny this, but it rests on the best and fairest Gentile\r\nevidence. He has guards at his gates, and he never appears in public\r\nunattended by friends and followers, who are of course armed. That such\r\na mental anomaly often exists, those familiar with the biographies\r\nof the Brahmin officials at the courts of Poonah, Sattara, and other\r\nplaces in India, well know: many a “Pant,” whose reckless audacity in\r\nintrigue conducted under imminent danger of life argued the courage of\r\na Cœur de Lion, was personally fearful as Hobbes, and displayed at the\r\ndeath the terrors of Robespierre. A moment of fear is recounted of St.\r\nPeter; Erasmus was not the stuff of which martyrs are made, and even\r\nthe _beau sabreur_ once ran. However, in the case of the Prophet there\r\nis an absolute necessity for precautions: as Gentiles have themselves\r\nowned to me, many a ruffian, if he found an opportunity, would, from\r\npure love of notoriety, even without stronger incentive, try his\r\nrevolver or his bowie-knife upon the “Big Mormon.”\r\n\r\nOn this occasion the place of Mr. Brigham Young was taken by President\r\nBishop Hunter, a Pennsylvanian, whom even the most fanatic and\r\nintentionally evil-speaking anti-Mormon must regard with respect.\r\nPreceded by a brass band--“this people” delight in\r\n\r\n    “Sonorous metal blowing martial sounds”--\r\n\r\nand accompanied by the City Marshal, he stood up in his conveyance,\r\nand, calling up the Captains of Companies, shook hands with them and\r\nproceeded forthwith to business. In a short time arrangements were\r\nmade to house and employ all who required work, whether men or women.\r\nHaving read certain offensive accounts about “girl-hunting elders,”\r\n“gray-headed gallants,” and “ogling apostles,” I was somewhat surprised\r\nto see that every thing was conducted with the greatest decorum.\r\nThe Gentiles, however, declare that Mr. Brigham Young and the high\r\ndignitaries have issued an order against “pre-emption” on the part of\r\ntheir followers, who escort and accompany the emigrant trains across\r\nthe prairies.\r\n\r\n[SAINTS’ NAMES.]\r\n\r\nMr. Stenhouse circulated freely among the crowd, and introduced me\r\nto many whose names I do not remember; in almost every case the\r\nintroduction was followed by some invitation. He now exchanged a word\r\nwith this “brother,” then a few sentences with that “sister,” carefully\r\nsuppressing the Mr. and Madam of the Eastern States. The fraternal\r\naddress gives a patriarchal and somewhat Oriental flavor to Mormon\r\nconverse; like other things, however, it is apt to run into extremes.\r\nIf a boy in the streets be asked, “What’s your name?” he will reply--if\r\nhe condescends to do so--“I’m brother such-and-such’s son.” In order\r\nto distinguish children of different mothers, it is usual to prefix\r\nthe maternal to the paternal parent’s name, suppressing the given or\r\nChristian name of monogamic lands. Thus, for instance, my sons by Miss\r\nBrown, Miss Jones, and Miss Robinson, would call themselves Brother\r\nBrown Burton, Brother Jones Burton, and so on. The Saints--even the\r\nhighest dignitaries--wave the Reverend and the ridiculous Esquire;\r\nthat “title much in use among vulgar people,” which in Old and New\r\nEngland applies to every body, gentle or simple, has not yet extended\r\nto Great Salt Lake City. The Mormon pontiff and the eminences around\r\nhim are simply Brother or Mister--they have the substance, and they\r\ndisdain the shadow of power. _En revanche_, among the crowd there\r\nare as many colonels and majors--about ten being the proportion to\r\none captain--as in the days when Mrs. Trollope set the Mississippi\r\non fire. Sister is applied to women of all ages, thus avoiding the\r\ndifficulty of addressing a dowager, as in the Eastern States, Madam, in\r\ncontradistinction to Mrs., her daughter-in-law, or, what is worse, of\r\ncalling her after the English way, old Mrs. A., or, _Scotticè_, Mrs. A.\r\nsenior.\r\n\r\n[A “GOWK.”]\r\n\r\nThe dress of the fair sex has, I observed, already become peculiar.\r\nThe article called in Cornwall a “gowk,” in other parts of England a\r\n“cottage bonnet,” and in the United States a “sun-bonnet,” is here\r\nuniversally used, with the difference, however, that the Mormons\r\nprovide it with a long thick veil behind, which acts like a cape or\r\nshawl. A loose jacket and a petticoat, mostly of calico or of some\r\ninexpensive stuff, compose the _tout visible_. The wealthier affect\r\nsilks, especially black. The merchants are careful to keep on hand a\r\nlarge stock of fancy goods, millinery, and other feminine adornments.\r\nLove of dress is no accident in the mental organization of that sex\r\nwhich some one called ζωον φιλοκοσμον; the essential is a pleasing\r\nfoible, in which the semi-nude savage and the crinolined “civilizee,”\r\nthe nun and Quakeress, the sinner and the saint, the _biche_, the\r\n_petite maîtresse_, and the _grande dame_, all meet for once in\r\ntheir lives pretty much on a par, and on the same ground. Great Salt\r\nLake City contains three “millinery stores,” besides thirteen of dry\r\ngoods and two of fancy goods, or varieties; and some exchange their\r\nmerchandise for grain.\r\n\r\nThe contrast of _physique_ between the new arrivals and the older\r\ncolonists, especially those born in the vicinity of the prairies, was\r\nsalient. While the fresh importations were of that solid and sometimes\r\nclumsy form and dimensions that characterize the English at home--where\r\n“beauty is seldom found in cottages or workshops, even when no real\r\nhardships are suffered”--the others had much of the delicacy of figure\r\nand complexion which distinguishes the American women of the United\r\nStates. Physiologists may perhaps doubt so rapid and perceptible an\r\noperation of climate, but India proves clearly enough that a very few\r\nyears suffice to deteriorate form and color, especially in the weaker\r\nhalf of humanity; why, then, should we think it impossible that a\r\nclimate of extremes, an air of exceeding purity and tenuity, and an\r\narid position 4000 feet above sea level, can produce the opposite\r\nresults in as short a space of time? But, whether my theory stand or\r\nfall, the fact remains the same. I remarked to my companion the change\r\nfrom the lymphatic and the sanguine to the bilious-nervous and the\r\npurely nervous temperament, and admired its results, the fining down\r\nof redundancy in wrist, ankle, and waist, the superior placidness and\r\nthoughtfulness of expression, and the general appearance of higher\r\ncaste blood. I could not but observe in those born hereabouts the noble\r\nregular features, the lofty, thoughtful brow, the clear, transparent\r\ncomplexion, the long silky hair, and, greatest charm of all, the soft\r\nsmile of the American woman when she does smile. He appeared surprised,\r\nand said that most other Gentiles had explained the thinness of form\r\nand reflective look by the perpetual fretting of the fair under the\r\nstarveling _régime_ of polygamy. The belle of the crowd was Miss Sally\r\nA----, the daughter of a lawyer, and of course a _ci devant_ judge.\r\nStrict Mormons, however, rather wag the head at this pretty person;\r\nshe is supposed to prefer Gentile and heathenish society, and it is\r\nwhispered against her that she has actually vowed never to marry a\r\nSaint.\r\n\r\n[AN ILLUSTRATION.]\r\n\r\nI “queried” of my companion how the new arrivals usually behave at\r\nGreat Salt Lake City, when the civilization, or rather the humanization\r\nof a voyage, a long journey, and the sense of helplessness caused\r\nby new position, have somewhat mitigated their British bounce and\r\nself-esteem. “Pretty well,” he replied; “all expect to be at the\r\ntop of the tree at once, and they find themselves in the wrong box;\r\nno man gets on here by pushing; he begins at the lowest seat; a new\r\nhand is not trusted; he is first sent on mission, then married, and\r\nthen allowed to rise higher if he shows himself useful.” This bore a\r\n_cachet_ of truth:\r\n\r\n    Les sots sont un peuple nombreux,\r\n      Trouvant toutes choses faciles;\r\n    Il faut le leur passer; souvent ils sont heureux,\r\n      Grand motif de se croire habiles.\r\n\r\n    (_L’Ane et la Flûte._)\r\n\r\nMany of these English emigrants have passed over the plains without\r\nknowing that they are in the United States, and look upon Mr. Brigham\r\nYoung much as Roman Catholics of the last generation regarded the Pope.\r\nThe Welsh, Danes, and Swedes have been seen on the transit to throw\r\naway their blankets and warm clothing, from a conviction that a gay\r\nsummer reigns throughout the year in Zion. The mismanagement of the\r\ninexperienced travelers has become a matter of Joe Miller. An old but\r\nfavorite illustration, told from the Mississippi to California, is\r\nthis: A man rides up to a standing wagon, and seeing a wretched-looking\r\nlad nursing a starving baby, asks him what the matter may be: “Wal,\r\nnow,” responds the youth, “guess I’m kinder streakt--ole dad’s\r\ndrunk, ole marm’s in hy-sterics, brother Jim be playing poker with\r\ntwo gamblers, sister Sal’s down yonder a’ courtin’ with an in-tire\r\nstranger, this ’ere baby’s got the diaree, the team’s clean guv out,\r\nthe wagon’s broke down, it’s twenty miles to the next water, I don’t\r\ncare a ---- if I never see Californy.”\r\n\r\n[THEATRICALS.]\r\n\r\nWe returned homeward by the States Road, in which are two of the\r\nprincipal buildings. On the left is the Council Hall of the Seventies,\r\nan adobe tenement of the usual barn shape, fifty feet long by thirty\r\ninternally, used for the various purposes of deliberation, preaching,\r\nand dancing; I looked through the windows, and saw that it was hung\r\nwith red. It is a provisional building, used until a larger can be\r\nerected. A little beyond the Seventies’ Hall, and on the other side of\r\nthe road, was the Social Hall, the usual scene of Mormon festivities;\r\nit resembled the former, but it was larger--73 × 33 feet--and better\r\nfurnished. The gay season had not arrived; I lost, therefore, an\r\nopportunity of seeing the beauty and fashion of Great Salt Lake City\r\nin ballroom toilette, but I heard enough to convince me that the\r\nSaints, though grave and unjovial, are a highly sociable people. They\r\ndelight in sleighing and in private theatricals, and boast of some good\r\namateur actors, among whom Messrs. B. Snow, H. B. Clawson, and W. C.\r\nDunbar are particularly mentioned. Sir E. L. Bulwer will perhaps be\r\npleased to hear that the “Lady of Lyons” excited more furore here than\r\neven in Europe. It is intended, as soon as funds can be collected,\r\nto build a theatre which will vie with those of the Old Country.\r\nDancing seems to be considered an edifying exercise. The Prophet\r\ndances, the Apostles dance, the Bishops dance. A professor of this\r\nbranch of the fine arts would thrive in Zion, where the most learned of\r\npedagogues would require to eke out a living after the fashion of one\r\nAristocles, surnamed the “broad-shouldered.” The saltation is not in\r\nthe languid, done-up style that polite Europe affects; as in the days\r\nof our grandparents, “positions” are maintained, steps are elaborately\r\nexecuted, and a somewhat severe muscular exercise is the result. I\r\nconfess to a prejudice against dancing after the certain, which we are\r\ntold is the uncertain, epoch of life, and have often joined in the\r\nmerriment excited among French folks by the aspect of some bald-headed\r\nand stiff-jointed “Anglais” mingling crabbed age with joyful youth in\r\na public ball. Yet there is high authority for perseverance in the\r\npractice: David danced, we are told, with all his might, and Scipio,\r\naccording to Seneca, was wont thus to exercise his heroic limbs.\r\n\r\nBesides the grand fêtes at the Social Hall and other subscription\r\nestablishments, there are “Ward Parties,” and “Elders’ Weekly Cotillon\r\nParties,” where possibly the seniors dance together, as the Oxford\r\ndons did drill--in private. Polkas, as at the court of St. James’s,\r\nare disapproved of. It is generally asserted that to the New Faith\r\nTerpsichore owes a fresh form of worship, the Mormon cotillon--alias\r\nquadrille--in which the cavalier leads out, characteristically, two\r\ndames. May I not be allowed to recommend the importation of this\r\ndecided improvement into Leamington and other watering-places, where\r\nthe proportion of the sexes at “hops” rarely exceeds one to seven?\r\n\r\nThe balls at the Social Hall are highly select, and are conducted on\r\nan expensive scale; invitations are issued on embossed bordered and\r\ngilt-edged white paper, say to 75-80 of the _élite_, including a few of\r\nthe chief Gentiles. The ticket is in this form and style:\r\n\r\n  +----------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                    PARTY AT SOCIAL HALL.                       |\r\n  |                                                                |\r\n  |   Mr. ---- and Ladies are respectfully invited to attend a     |\r\n  |                  Party at the SOCIAL HALL,                     |\r\n  |                                                                |\r\n  |                ON TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 1860.                   |\r\n  |                                                                |\r\n  |                _Tickets_, $10 (£2) _per Couple_.               |\r\n  |                                                                |\r\n  |                         Mayor A.

In the less splendid fêtes $2 50 would be\r\nthe total price. Premiums are offered when the time draws nigh, but\r\nspace is limited, and many a Jacob is shorn of his glory by appearing\r\nwith only Rachel for a follower, and without his train of Leahs,\r\nZilpahs, and Billahs.\r\n\r\n[THE SUPPER.]\r\n\r\nAn account of the last ball may be abridged. The hall was tastefully\r\nand elegantly decorated; the affecting motto, “Our Mountain Home,”\r\nconspicuously placed among hangings and evergreens, was highly\r\neffective. At 4 P.M. the Prophet and ex-President entered, and “order\r\nwas called.” (N.B.--Might not this be tried to a purpose in a London\r\nball-room?) Ascending a kind of platform, with uplifted hands he\r\nblessed those present. Farther East I have heard of the reverse being\r\ndone, especially by the _maître du logis_. He then descended to the\r\nboards and led off the first cotillon. At 8 P.M. supper was announced;\r\ncovers for 250 persons had been laid by Mr. Candland, “mine host”\r\nof “The Globe.” On the following page will be found the list of the\r\nsomewhat substantial goodies that formed the _carte_.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the _cuisine_ in Utah Territory has some\r\nnovelties, such as bear and beaver. The former meat is a favorite\r\nthroughout the West, especially when the animal is fresh from feeding;\r\nafter hibernation it is hard and lean. In the Himalayas many a\r\nsportsman, after mastering an artificial aversion to eat bear’s grease,\r\nhas enjoyed a grill of “cuffy.” The paws, which not a little resemble\r\nthe human hand, are excellent--_experto crede_. I can not pronounce _ex\r\ncathedrâ_ upon beavers’ tails; there is no reason, however, why they\r\nshould be inferior to the appendage of a Cape sheep. “Slaw”--according\r\nto my informants--is synonymous with sauer-kraut. Mountain, Pioneer,\r\nand Snowballs are unknown to me, except by their names, which are\r\ncertainly patriotic, if not descriptive.\r\n\r\n[DANCING.]\r\n\r\nAfter supper dancing was resumed with spirit, and in its intervals\r\npopular songs and duets were performed by the best musicians. The\r\n“finest party of the season” ended as it began, with prayer and\r\nbenediction, at 5 A.M.--thirteen successive mortal hours--it shows a\r\nsolid power of enduring enjoyments! And, probably, the revelers wended\r\ntheir way home chanting some kind of national hymn like this, to the\r\ntune of the “Ole Kentucky shore:”\r\n\r\n    “Let the chorus still be sung,\r\n    Long live Brother Brigham Young.\r\n      And blessed be the Vale of Deserét--rét--rét!\r\n      And blessed be the Vale of Deserét.”\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                                                  |\r\n  |           TERRITORIAL AND CIVIL BALL,            |\r\n  |                                                  |\r\n  |          SOCIAL HALL, FEBRUARY 7, 1860.          |\r\n  |                      ----                        |\r\n  |                  BILL OF FARE.                   |\r\n  |                      ----                        |\r\n  |                                                  |\r\n  |                  First Course.                   |\r\n  |                                                  |\r\n  |                     SOUPS.                       |\r\n  |                                                  |\r\n  |  Oyster,                     Vermicelli,         |\r\n  |  Ox-tail,                    Vegetable.          |\r\n  |                                                  |\r\n  |                  Second Course.                  |\r\n  |                                                  |\r\n  |                     MEATS.                       |\r\n  |                                                  |\r\n  |   _Roast._                       _Boiled._       |\r\n  |                                                  |\r\n  |  Beef,                       Sugar-corned beef,  |\r\n  |  Mutton,                     Mutton,             |\r\n  |  Mountain Mutton,            Chickens,           |\r\n  |  Bear,                       Ducks,              |\r\n  |  Elk,                        Tripe,              |\r\n  |  Deer,                       Turkey,             |\r\n  |  Chickens,                   Ham,                |\r\n  |  Ducks,                      Trout,              |\r\n  |  Turkeys.

The judge was already in confab with a Pennsylvanian compatriot,\r\nColonel S. C. Stambaugh, of the Militia, Surveyor General of Utah\r\nTerritory. This gentleman is no great favorite with the Saints: they\r\naccuse him of a too great skillfulness in “mixing”--cocktails, for\r\ninstance--and a degree of general joviality that swears (_qui jure_)\r\nwith the grave and reverend seigniory around him. His crime, it\r\nappears to me, chiefly consists in holding a fat appointment. I need\r\nhardly say that at Great Salt Lake City party feeling rises higher,\r\nperhaps, than in any other small place, because religious acrimony is\r\nsuperadded to the many conflicting interests. Every man’s concerns\r\nare his neighbor’s; no one, apparently, ever heard of that person who\r\n“became immensely rich”--to quote an Americanism--by “minding his\r\nown business.” As often happens, religion is made, like slavery in\r\nthe Eastern States and opium in China, the _cheval de bataille_; the\r\nroot of the quarrel must be sought deeper; in other words, interest,\r\nand interest only, is the Tisiphone that shakes the brand of war. As\r\nMormonism grows, its frame becomes more strongly knit. Thus the Gentile\r\nmerchants, who have made from 120 to 600 per cent. on capital, were,\r\nat the time of my visit, preparing to sell off, because they found the\r\ncombination against them overpowering. For the most part they vowed\r\nthat there is no people with whom they would rather do business than\r\nwith the Mormons; praised their honesty and punctuality in payments,\r\nand compared them advantageously in such matters with those of the\r\nolder faith. Yet they had resolved to remove. The total number of\r\nGentiles in the city is probably not more than 300, a small proportion\r\nto a body of at least 9000.\r\n\r\n[CLIQUISM.]\r\n\r\nA stranger, especially an official, is kindly warned, on his first\r\narrival at Great Salt Lake City, of its inveterate cliquism, and is\r\namicably advised to steer a middle course, without turning to the right\r\nor to the left, between the Scylla and Charybdis of Christianity and\r\nMormonism. This mezzo-termine may be possible in official matters;\r\nin society it is not. I soon saw that, though a traveler on the wing\r\nmight sit alternately in the tents of Shem and Japhet, a resident\r\nwould soon be obliged to dwell exclusively in either one or the\r\nother. When Gentile and Mormon meet, they either maintain a studied\r\nor surly silence, or they enter into a dialogue which, on a closer\r\nacquaintance with its formation, proves to be a conglomerate of “rile”\r\nand “knagg”--an unpleasant predicament for those _en tiers_. Such, at\r\nleast, was my short experience, and I believe that of my companions.\r\n\r\nColonel Stambaugh, a day or two after the introduction, offered to\r\nact cicerone through the settlement, and I was happy to accept his\r\nkindness. One fine evening we drove along the Tooele Road westward,\r\nand drank of the waters of the New Jordan, which, to the unregenerate\r\npalate, tasted, I must say, somewhat brackish and ill-flavored. The\r\nriver is at this season about one hundred feet broad, and not too\r\ndeep below its banks to be useless for irrigation, which, as the\r\ncity increases, will doubtless be extended. It is spanned by a wooden\r\nbridge so rickety that it shakes with a child’s tread--the governor has\r\nurgently but unavailingly represented the necessity of reconstruction.\r\nBut, although the true Western, or rather Keltic recklessness of\r\nhuman life--which contrasts so strongly with the sanctity attached\r\nto it by the old Roman and the modern Anglo-Scandinavian--here still\r\ndisplays itself, in some points there is no disregard for improvement.\r\nMr. Brigham Young has seen the evils of disforesting the land, and\r\nthe want of plantations; he has lately contracted for planting, near\r\nJordan and elsewhere, a million of young trees at the rate of one\r\ncent each. On the way we saw several fine Durhams and Devons, which\r\nare driven out every morning and back every evening under the charge\r\nof a boy, who receives one and a half cent _per mensem_ a head. The\r\nanimals have been brought across the prairies at great trouble and\r\nexpense: stock-breeding is one of the Prophet’s useful hobbies, and the\r\ndifference between the cattle in Utah Territory and the old Spanish\r\nherds still seen in the country parts of California is remarkable. The\r\nland, as will presently appear, is better calculated for grazing than\r\nfor agriculture, and a settlement of 500 souls rarely has less than 500\r\nhead of cattle.\r\n\r\nReturning from Jordan, we re-entered the city by the western road, and\r\ndrove through Mr. Brigham Young’s block toward the Northern Kanyon.\r\nThe gateway was surmounted by a plaster group, consisting of a huge\r\nvulturine eagle, perched, with wings outspread, neck bended as if\r\nsnuffing the breeze of carrion from afar, and talons clinging upon a\r\nyellow bee-hive--a most uncomfortable and unnatural position for the\r\npoor animal. The device is doubtless highly symbolical, emblematical,\r\ntypical--in fact, every thing but appropriate and commonsensical. The\r\nsame, however, may be said of one of the most picturesque ensigns in\r\nthe civilized world--what have stars to do with stripes or stripes with\r\nstars? It might be the device of the British or Austrian soldier--only\r\nin their case, unlike the flag of the United States, the stripes\r\nshould be many and the stars few. _En passant_ we remarked a kind of\r\nguard-room at the eastern doorway of the White House--a presidential\r\ntitle which the house of prophecy in New Zion shares with the house of\r\npolitication[130] at Washington: my informants hinted that, in case of\r\nan assault upon head-quarters by roughs, marshals, or other officials,\r\nfifty rifles could at once be brought to bear upon the spot, and 1000\r\nafter the first hour. On the eastern side of the compound were the\r\nstables; a lamb in effigy surmounted the entrance, and meekly reposed\r\nunder the humane injunction, “Take care of your flocks.” Beyond this\r\npoint lay a number of decrepit emigrant wagons, drawn up to form a\r\nfence, a young plantation of fruitless peaches, and the remnants of the\r\nfalling wall.\r\n\r\n  [130] The Western press uses to “politicate,” _v. n._ to make a\r\n  trade of politics, and the participle politicating--why not, then,\r\n  politication?\r\n\r\n[BRIGHAM’S KANYON.]\r\n\r\nWe then struck into “City,” usually known as “Brigham’s” Kanyon, the\r\nProphet having a saw-mill upon the upper course. It is the normal deep\r\nnarrow gorge, with a beautiful little stream, which is drawn off by\r\nraised water-courses at different altitudes to supply the settlement.\r\nThe banks are margined with dwarf oaks and willows; limestone,\r\nsandstone, and granite, all of fine building quality, lie scattered\r\nabout in profusion, while high above rise the acclivities of the gash,\r\nthinly sprinkled with sage and sunflower. Artemisia in this part\r\nimproves like the population in appearance, nor is it always a sign of\r\nsterility; in parts wheat grows well where the shrub has been uprooted.\r\nThe road along the little torrent was excellent; it would have cost\r\n$100,000 in Pennsylvania, but here much is done by tithe-work;\r\nmoreover, the respect for the Prophet is such that men would rather\r\nwork for him on credit than take pay from others.\r\n\r\n[UTAH LIBRARY.]\r\n\r\nBeing in want of local literature, after vainly ransacking the few\r\nbook-stalls which the city contains, I went to the Public Library,\r\nand, by sending in a card, at once obtained admission. As usual in\r\nthe Territories of the United States, this institution is supported\r\nby the federal government, which, besides $1500 for books, gave $5000\r\nfor the establishment, and $400 from the treasury of Utah is paid to\r\nthe Territorial librarian, Mr. John Lyon, who is also a poet. The\r\nmanagement is under the Secretary of the Territory, and the public\r\ndesire to see an extra grant of $500 per annum.[131] The volumes, about\r\n1000 in number, are placed in a large room on the north side of the\r\n“Mountaineer” office, and the librarian attends every Thursday, when\r\nbooks are “loaned” to numerous applicants. The works are principally\r\nthose of reference, elementary, and intended for the general reader,\r\nsuch as travels, popular histories, and novels. The “Woman in White”\r\nhad already found her way across the prairies, and she received the\r\nhonors and admiration which she deserved.\r\n\r\n  [131] An Act in relation to Utah Library:\r\n\r\n  Sec. 1. Be it enacted by the Governor and Legislative Assembly of\r\n  the Territory of Utah, That a librarian shall be elected by a joint\r\n  vote of the Legislative Assembly of the Territory of Utah, whose duty\r\n  it shall be to take charge of the library (known in law as the Utah\r\n  Library), as hereinafter prescribed.\r\n\r\n  Sec. 2. Said librarian shall hold his office during the term of two\r\n  years, or until his successor is appointed, and shall give bonds for\r\n  the faithful discharge of his duties in the sum of $6000, and file\r\n  the same in the office of Secretary of the Territory before entering\r\n  upon his duties, who may also appoint a deputy, as occasion requires,\r\n  to act in his stead, under the same restrictions as the principal\r\n  librarian.\r\n\r\n  Sec. 3. It shall be the duty of the librarian to cause to be printed,\r\n  at as early a date as practicable, a full and accurate catalogue of\r\n  all books, maps, globes, charts, papers, apparatus, and valuable\r\n  specimens in any way belonging to said library; also to use diligent\r\n  efforts to preserve from waste, loss, or damage, any portion of said\r\n  library.\r\n\r\n  Sec. 4. It shall be the duty of the librarian, for and in behalf of\r\n  the Territory of Utah, to plant suits, collect fines, prosecute,\r\n  or defend the interests of said library, or otherwise act as a\r\n  legal plaintiff or defendant in behalf of the Territory, where the\r\n  interests of the library are concerned.\r\n\r\n  Sec. 5. The location of the library shall be at the seat of\r\n  government of the Territory of Utah, and it shall be the duty of the\r\n  librarian to have all the books of the library orderly and properly\r\n  arranged within the library-room, for the use of such officers and\r\n  persons as are named in the fourteenth section of the Organic Act\r\n  for Utah Territory, during each session of the Legislative Assembly\r\n  of Utah; provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall\r\n  debar the librarian, in vacation of the Legislative Assembly, from\r\n  permitting books, maps, and papers being drawn from said library,\r\n  for professional and scientific purposes, by officers of the United\r\n  States and of Utah Territory, and other citizens of Utah, where the\r\n  librarian shall judge the public good may justify.\r\n\r\n  Sec. 6. It shall be the duty of the librarian to let out books for\r\n  a specified time, and call in the same when due, inflict fines for\r\n  damage or loss of books, and collect the same, and keep an accurate\r\n  account of all his official doings in a book kept for that purpose,\r\n  and make an annual report of the same to the Legislative Assembly of\r\n  Utah; provided that no fine shall be excessive, or more than four\r\n  times the purchase price of the book or books for the loss or damage\r\n  of which the fine may be inflicted.\r\n\r\n  Sec. 7. The librarian is hereby entitled to draw from the treasury of\r\n  Utah for the current year as compensation for his services the sum of\r\n  $400, not otherwise appropriated; also the sum of $200 to defray the\r\n  expenses of stationery, printing catalogue, and other contingencies.\r\n\r\n  Approved March 6, 1852.\r\n\r\n[HARROWGATE WATERS.]\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 30th of August, after dining with the governor,\r\nI accompanied him to the Thermal Springs, one of the lions of the\r\nplace. We struck into the north road, and soon issued from the town. On\r\nthe right hand we passed a large tumble-down tenement which has seen\r\nmany vicissitudes. It began life as a bath-house and bathing-place,\r\nto which the white sulphury waters of the Warm Springs,[132] issuing\r\nfrom below Ensign Peak, were brought in pine-log pipes. It contained\r\nalso a ballroom, two parlors for clubs and supper-parties, and a double\r\nkitchen. It afterward became a hotel and public house for emigrants\r\nto California and Oregon. These, however, soon learned to prefer more\r\ncentral quarters, and now it has subsided into a tannery of low degree.\r\nAbout two and a half miles beyond the northern suburb are the Hot\r\nSprings,[133] which issue from the western slope of the hills lying\r\nbehind Ensign Peak. A generous supply of water, gushing from the rock\r\ninto a basin below, drains off and forms a lakelet, varying according\r\nto season from one to three miles in circumference. Where the water\r\nfirst issues it will boil an egg; a little below it raises the mercury\r\nto 128° F. Even at a distance from the source it preserves some heat,\r\nand, accordingly, it is frequented throughout the winter by flights of\r\nwater-fowl and camping Indians, whose children sit in it to thaw their\r\nhalf-frozen limbs. These springs, together with the fresh-water lake\r\nand the Jordan, are held to be more purifying than Abana and Pharphar,\r\nrivers of Damascus; and, being of the Harrowgate species, they will\r\ndoubtless be useful to the Valley people as soon as increased luxury\r\nrequires such appliances. When the wind sets in from the north, the\r\ndecided perfume of sulphureted hydrogen and saleratus is any thing but\r\neau de Cologne. An anti-Mormon writer, describing these springs and\r\nother evidences of igneous and volcanic action, dwells with complacency\r\nupon the probability that at some no distant time New Zion may find\r\nherself in a quandary, and--like the Cities of the Plain, to which\r\nshe is thus insinuatingly compared--fuel for the flames. On our way\r\nhome the governor pointed out the remains of building and other works\r\nupon a model farm, which had scarcely fared better than that of Niger\r\ncelebrity. The land around is hoar with salt, and bears nothing but\r\nsalsolæ and similar hopeless vegetation.\r\n\r\n  [132] The following is the analysis of the warm spring by Dr. L.\r\n  D. Gale, printed by Captain Stansbury in Appendix F. It dates from\r\n  1851, but apparently more detailed trials have not yet been made. One\r\n  hundred parts of the water (whose specific gravity was 1·0112) give\r\n  the following results:\r\n\r\n  Sulphureted hydrogen absorbed in the water  0·037454\r\n       „         „     combined with bases    0·000728\r\n  Carbonate of lime precipitated by boiling   0·075000\r\n       „         „  magnesia                  0·022770\r\n  Chloride of calcium                         0·005700\r\n  Sulphate of soda                            0·064835\r\n  Chloride of sodium                          0·861600\r\n                                              --------\r\n                                              1·023087\r\n\r\n  The usual temperature is laid down at 102° F.\r\n\r\n  [133] The water of the Hot Springs was found to have the specific\r\n  gravity of 1·0130, and 100 parts yielded solid contents 1·1454.\r\n\r\n  Chloride of sodium    0·8052\r\n     „        magnesia  0·0288\r\n     „        calcium   0·1096\r\n  Sulphate of lime      0·0806\r\n  Carbonate of lime     0·0180\r\n  Silica                0·0180\r\n                        ------\r\n                        1·0602\r\n\r\n  The usual temperature is laid down at 128° F.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nSecond Week at Great Salt Lake City.--Visit to the Prophet.\r\n\r\n\r\n[BRIGHAM YOUNG.]\r\n\r\nShortly after arriving, I had mentioned to Governor Cumming my desire\r\nto call upon Mr., or rather, as his official title is, President\r\nBrigham Young, and he honored me by inquiring what time would be most\r\nconvenient to him. The following was the answer: the body was in the\r\nhandwriting of an amanuensis--similarly Mr. Joseph Smith was in the\r\nhabit of dictation--and the signature, which would form a fair subject\r\nfor a Warrenologist, was the Prophet’s autograph.\r\n\r\n  “GOVERNOR A. CUMMING.\r\n\r\n  “Great Salt Lake City, Aug. 30, 1860.\r\n\r\n  “SIR,--In reply to your note of the 29th inst., I embrace the\r\n  earliest opportunity since my return to inform you that it will be\r\n  agreeable to me to meet the gentleman you mention in my office at 11\r\n  A.M. to-morrow, the 31st.\r\n\r\n  BRIGHAM YOUNG.”\r\n\r\nThe “President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints all\r\nover the World” is obliged to use caution in admitting strangers,\r\nnot only for personal safety, but also to defend his dignity from the\r\nrude and unfeeling remarks of visitors, who seem to think themselves\r\nentitled, in the case of a Mormon, to transgress every rule of civility.\r\n\r\nAbout noon, after a preliminary visit to Mr. Gilbert--and a visit\r\nin these lands always entails a certain amount of “smiling”--I met\r\nGovernor Cumming in Main Street, and we proceeded together to our\r\nvisit. After a slight scrutiny we passed the guard--which is dressed in\r\nplain clothes, and to the eye unarmed--and walking down the veranda,\r\nentered the Prophet’s private office. Several people who were sitting\r\nthere rose at Mr. Cumming’s entrance. At a few words of introduction,\r\nMr. Brigham Young advanced, shook hands with complete simplicity of\r\nmanner, asked me to be seated on a sofa at one side of the room, and\r\npresented me to those present.\r\n\r\nUnder ordinary circumstances it would be unfair in a visitor to draw\r\nthe portrait of one visited. But this is no common case. I have\r\nviolated no rites of hospitality. Mr. Brigham Young is a “seer,\r\nrevelator, and prophet, having all the gifts of God which he bestows\r\nupon the Head of the Church:” his memoirs, lithographs, photographs,\r\nand portraits have been published again and again; I add but one more\r\nlikeness; and, finally, I have nothing to say except in his favor.\r\n\r\nThe Prophet was born at Whittingham, Vermont, on the 1st of June,\r\n1801; he was consequently, in 1860, fifty-nine years of age; he looks\r\nabout forty-five. _La célébrité vieillit_--I had expected to see a\r\nvenerable-looking old man. Scarcely a gray thread appears in his hair,\r\nwhich is parted on the side, light colored, rather thick, and reaches\r\nbelow the ears with a half curl. He formerly wore it long, after the\r\nWestern style; now it is cut level with the ear-lobes. The forehead is\r\nsomewhat narrow, the eyebrows are thin, the eyes between gray and blue,\r\nwith a calm, composed, and somewhat reserved expression: a slight droop\r\nin the left lid made me think that he had suffered from paralysis; I\r\nafterward heard that the ptosis is the result of a neuralgia which has\r\nlong tormented him. For this reason he usually covers his head, except\r\nin his own house or in the Tabernacle. Mrs. Ward, who is followed by\r\nthe “Revue des Deux-Mondes,” therefore errs again in asserting that\r\n“his Mormon majesty never removes his hat in public.” The nose, which\r\nis fine and somewhat sharp-pointed, is bent a little to the left. The\r\nlips are close like the New Englander’s, and the teeth, especially\r\nthose of the under jaw, are imperfect. The cheeks are rather fleshy,\r\nand the line between the alæ of the nose and the mouth is broken;\r\nthe chin is somewhat peaked, and the face clean shaven, except under\r\nthe jaws, where the beard is allowed to grow. The hands are well\r\nmade, and not disfigured by rings. The figure is somewhat large,\r\nbroad-shouldered, and stooping a little when standing.\r\n\r\nThe Prophet’s dress was neat and plain as a Quaker’s, all gray homespun\r\nexcept the cravat and waistcoat. His coat was of antique cut, and,\r\nlike the pantaloons, baggy, and the buttons were black. A neck-tie of\r\ndark silk, with a large bow, was loosely passed round a starchless\r\ncollar, which turned down of its own accord. The waistcoat was of black\r\nsatin--once an article of almost national dress--single-breasted, and\r\nbuttoned nearly to the neck, and a plain gold chain was passed into the\r\npocket. The boots were Wellingtons, apparently of American make.\r\n\r\n[“BRIGHAM.”]\r\n\r\nAltogether the Prophet’s appearance was that of a gentleman\r\nfarmer in New England--in fact, such as he is: his father was an\r\nagriculturist and revolutionary soldier, who settled “down East.” He\r\nis a well-preserved man; a fact which some attribute to his habit of\r\nsleeping, as the Citizen Proudhon so strongly advises, in solitude. His\r\nmanner is at once affable and impressive, simple and courteous: his\r\nwant of pretension contrasts favorably with certain pseudo-prophets\r\nthat I have seen, each and every of whom holds himself to be a “Logos”\r\nwithout other claim save a semi-maniacal self-esteem. He shows no signs\r\nof dogmatism, bigotry, or fanaticism, and never once entered--with\r\nme at least--upon the subject of religion. He impresses a stranger\r\nwith a certain sense of power; his followers are, of course, wholly\r\nfascinated by his superior strength of brain. It is commonly said there\r\nis only one chief in Great Salt Lake City, and that is “Brigham.”\r\nHis temper is even and placid; his manner is cold--in fact, like his\r\nface, somewhat bloodless; but he is neither morose nor methodistic,\r\nand, where occasion requires, he can use all the weapons of ridicule\r\nto direful effect, and “speak a bit of his mind” in a style which\r\nno one forgets. He often reproves his erring followers in purposely\r\nviolent language, making the terrors of a scolding the punishment in\r\nlieu of hanging for a stolen horse or cow. His powers of observation\r\nare intuitively strong, and his friends declare him to be gifted\r\nwith an excellent memory and a perfect judgment of character. If he\r\ndislikes a stranger at the first interview, he never sees him again.\r\nOf his temperance and sobriety there is but one opinion. His life is\r\nascetic: his favorite food is baked potatoes with a little buttermilk,\r\nand his drink water: he disapproves, as do all strict Mormons, of\r\nspirituous liquors, and never touches any thing stronger than a glass\r\nof thin Lager-bier; moreover, he abstains from tobacco. Mr. Hyde has\r\naccused him of habitual intemperance: he is, as his appearance shows,\r\nrather disposed to abstinence than to the reverse. Of his education\r\nI can not speak: “men, not books--deeds, not words,” has ever been\r\nhis motto; he probably has, as Mr. Randolph said of Mr. Johnston, “a\r\nmind uncorrupted by books.” In the only discourse which I heard him\r\ndeliver, he pronounced impětus, impētus. Yet he converses with ease\r\nand correctness, has neither snuffle nor pompousness, and speaks\r\nas an authority upon certain subjects, such as agriculture and\r\nstock-breeding. He assumes no airs of extra sanctimoniousness, and has\r\nthe plain, simple manners of honesty. His followers deem him an angel\r\nof light, his foes a goblin damned: he is, I presume, neither one nor\r\nthe other. I can not pronounce about his scrupulousness: all the world\r\nover, the sincerest religious belief and the practice of devotion are\r\nsometimes compatible not only with the most disorderly life, but with\r\nthe most terrible crimes; for mankind mostly believes that\r\n\r\n    “Il est avec le ciel des accommodements.”\r\n\r\nHe has been called hypocrite, swindler, forger, murderer. No one looks\r\nit less. The best authorities--from those who accuse Mr. Joseph Smith\r\nof the most heartless deception, to those who believe that he began\r\nas an impostor and ended as a prophet--find in Mr. Brigham Young “an\r\nearnest, obstinate egotistic enthusiasm, fanned by persecution and\r\ninflamed by bloodshed.” He is the St. Paul of the New Dispensation:\r\ntrue and sincere, he gave point, and energy, and consistency to the\r\nsomewhat disjointed, turbulent, and unforeseeing fanaticism of Mr.\r\nJoseph Smith; and if he has not been able to create, he has shown\r\nhimself great in controlling circumstances. Finally, there is a total\r\nabsence of pretension in his manner, and he has been so long used to\r\npower that he cares nothing for its display. The arts by which he rules\r\nthe heterogeneous mass of conflicting elements are indomitable will,\r\nprofound secrecy, and uncommon astuteness.\r\n\r\nSuch is His Excellency President Brigham Young, “painter and\r\nglazier”--his earliest craft--prophet, revelator, translator, and seer;\r\nthe man who is revered as king or kaiser, pope or pontiff never was;\r\nwho, like the Old Man of the Mountain, by holding up his hand could\r\ncause the death of any one within his reach; who, governing as well as\r\nreigning, long stood up to fight with the sword of the Lord, and with\r\nhis few hundred guerrillas, against the then mighty power of the United\r\nStates; who has outwitted all diplomacy opposed to him; and, finally,\r\nwho made a treaty of peace with the President of the Great Republic as\r\nthough he had wielded the combined power of France, Russia, and England.\r\n\r\nRemembering the frequent query, “What shall be done with the Mormons?”\r\nI often asked the Saints, Who will or can succeed Mr. Brigham Young? No\r\none knows, and no one cares. They reply, with a singular disdain for\r\nthe usual course of history, with a perfect faith that their Cromwell\r\nwill know no Richard as his successor, that, as when the crisis came\r\nthe Lord raised up in him, then unknown and little valued, a fitting\r\nsuccessor to Mr. Joseph Smith--of whom, by-the-by, they now speak\r\nwith a respectful reverential _sotto voce_, as Christians name the\r\nFounder of their faith--so, when the time for deciding the succession\r\nshall arrive, the chosen Saints will not be left without a suitable\r\ntheocrat to exalt the people Israel. The Prophet professes, I believe,\r\nto hold office in a kind of spiritual allegiance to the Smith family,\r\nof which the eldest son, Mr. Joseph Smith, the third of that dynasty,\r\nhas of late years, though blessed by his father, created a schism in\r\nthe religion. By the persuasions of his mother, who, after the first\r\nProphet’s death, gave him a Gentile stepfather, he has abjured polygamy\r\nand settled in the Mansion House at Nauvoo. The Mormons, though ready\r\nto receive back the family at Great Salt Lake City when manifested by\r\nthe Lord, hardly look to him as their future chief. They all, however,\r\nand none more than Mr. Brigham Young, show the best of feeling toward\r\nthe descendants of their founder, and expect much from David Smith,\r\nthe second and posthumous son of him martyred at Carthage. He was\r\ncalled David, and choicely blessed before his birth by his father, who\r\nprophesied that the Lord will see to his children. Moreover, all speak\r\nin the highest terms of Mr. Joseph A. Young, the dweller at the White\r\nHouse, the eldest son of the ex-governor, who traveled in Europe and\r\nEngland, and distinguished himself in opposition to the federal troops.\r\n\r\n[“SQUIRE WELLS.”--HEBER C. KIMBALL.]\r\n\r\nAfter finishing with the “Lion of the Lord,” I proceeded to observe his\r\ncompanions. By my side was seated Daniel H., whose title is “General,”\r\nWells, the Superintendent of Public Works, and the commander of the\r\nNauvoo Legion. He is the third President of the Mormon triumvirate, and\r\nhaving been a justice of the peace and an alderman in Illinois, when\r\nthe Mormons dwelt there in 1839, he is usually known as Squire Wells:\r\nhe became a Saint when the Mormons were driven from Nauvoo in 1846, and\r\ntook their part in battles against the mob. In appearance he is a tall,\r\nlarge, bony, rufous man, and his conduct of the affair in 1857-’8 is\r\nspoken of with admiration by Mormons. The second of the Presidency, Mr.\r\nHeber C. Kimball, was not present at that time, but on another occasion\r\nhe was: Mr. Brigham Young introduced me to him, remarking, with a quiet\r\nand peculiar smile, that during his friend’s last visit to England, at\r\na meeting of the Methodists, one of the reverends attempted to pull\r\nhis chair from under him; at which reminiscence the person alluded to\r\nlooked uncommonly grim. Mr. Kimball was born in the same year as Mr.\r\nBrigham Young, and was first baptized in 1832: he is a devoted follower\r\nof the Prophet, a very Jonathan to this David, a Umar to the New Islam.\r\nHe is a large and powerful man, not unlike a blacksmith, which I\r\nbelieve he was, and is now the owner of a fine block, with houses and\r\nbarns, garden and orchard, north of and adjoining that of Mr. Brigham\r\nYoung. The third person present was the apostle Mr. George A. Smith,\r\nthe historian and recorder of the Territory, and a cousin of the first\r\nProphet: he is a walking almanac of Mormon events, and is still full\r\nof fight, strongly in favor of rubbing out the “wretched Irishmen and\r\nDutchmen sent from the East to try whether the Mormons would receive\r\nfederal officers.” Mr. Willford Woodruff, like Mr. Smith, one of\r\nthe original apostles, has visited England as a missionary, appeared\r\nbefore the public as polemic and controversialist, and has now settled\r\ndown as an apostle at Great Salt Lake City. Mr. Albert O. Carrington,\r\na graduate of Dartmouth College, had acted as second assistant on\r\nthe topographical survey to Captain Stansbury, who speaks of him as\r\nfollows: “Being a gentleman of liberal education, he soon acquired,\r\nunder instruction, the requisite skill, and by his zeal, industry, and\r\npractical good sense materially aided us in our subsequent operations.\r\nHe continued with the party till the termination of the survey,\r\naccompanied it to the city (Washington), and has since returned to\r\nhis mountain home, carrying with him the respect and good wishes of\r\nall with whom he was associated.” Of Mr. F. Little, who completed the\r\n_septem contra Christianitatem_ then present, I shall have more to say\r\nin a future chapter.\r\n\r\nThe Prophet received us in his private office, where he transacts the\r\ngreater part of his business, corrects his sermons, and conducts his\r\ncorrespondence. It is a plain, neat room, with the usual conveniences,\r\na large writing-desk and money-safe, table, sofas, and chairs, all made\r\nby the able mechanics of the settlement. I remarked a pistol and a\r\nrifle hung within ready reach on the right-hand wall; one of these is,\r\nI was told, a newly-invented twelve-shooter. There was a look of order,\r\nwhich suited the character of the man: it is said that a door badly\r\nhinged, or a curtain hung awry, “puts his eye out.” His style of doing\r\nbusiness at the desk or in the field--for the Prophet does not disdain\r\nhandiwork--is to issue distinct, copious, and intelligible directions\r\nto his _employés_, after which he dislikes referring to the subject. It\r\nis typical of his mode of acting, slow, deliberate, and conclusive. He\r\nhas the reputation of being wealthy. He rose to power a poor man. The\r\nGentiles naturally declare that he enriched himself by the tithes and\r\nplunder of his followers, and especially by preying upon and robbing\r\nthe Gentiles. I believe, however, that no one pays Church-dues and alms\r\nwith more punctuality than the Prophet, and that he has far too many\r\nopportunities of coining money, safely and honestly, to be guilty, like\r\nsome desperate destitute, of the short-sighted folly of fraud. In 1859\r\nhe owned, it is said, to being possessed of $250,000, equal to £50,000,\r\nwhich makes a millionaire in these mountains--it is too large a sum\r\nto jeopardize. His fortunes were principally made in business: like\r\nthe late Imaum of Muscat, he is the chief merchant as well as the high\r\npriest. He sends long trains of wagons freighted with various goods to\r\nthe Eastern States, and supplies caravans and settlements with grain\r\nand provisions. From the lumber which he sold to the federal troops for\r\nhutting themselves at Camp Floyd, he is supposed to have netted not\r\nless than $200,000. This is one of the sorest points with the army:\r\nall declare that the Mormons would have been in rags or sackcloth if\r\nsoldiers had not been sent; and they naturally grudge discomfort,\r\nhardship, and expatriation, whose only effect has been to benefit their\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\n[“LEMUEL.”--SLAVERY.]\r\n\r\nAfter the few first words of greeting, I interpreted the Prophet’s look\r\nto mean that he would not dislike to know my object in the City of\r\nthe Saints. I told him that, having read and heard much about Utah as\r\nit is said to be, I was anxious to see Utah as it is. He then entered\r\nbriefly upon the subjects of stock and agriculture, and described the\r\nseveral varieties of soil. One delicate topic was touched upon: he\r\nalluded to the “Indian wars,” as they are here called: he declared that\r\nwhen twenty are reported killed and wounded, that two or three would be\r\nnearer the truth, and that he could do more with a few pounds of flour\r\nand yards of cloth than all the sabres of the camp could effect. The\r\nsentiment was cordially seconded by all present. The Israelitic origin\r\nof “Lemuel,” and perhaps the prophecy that “many generations shall\r\nnot pass away among them save they shall be a white and delightsome\r\npeople,”[134] though untenable as an ethnologic theory, has in practice\r\nworked at least this much of good, that the Mormons treat their\r\nstep-brethren with far more humanity than other Western men: they\r\nfeed, clothe, and lodge them, and attach them by good works to their\r\ninterests. Slavery has been legalized in Utah, but solely for the\r\npurpose of inducing the Saints to buy children, who otherwise would be\r\nabandoned or destroyed by their starving parents.[135] During my stay\r\nin the city I did not see more than half a dozen negroes; and climate,\r\nwhich, disdaining man’s interference, draws with unerring hand the true\r\nand only compromise line between white and black labor, has irrevocably\r\ndecided that the African in these latitudes is valueless as a chattel,\r\nbecause his keep costs more than his work returns. The negro, however,\r\nis not admitted to the communion of Saints--rather a hard case for the\r\nHamite, if it be true that salvation is nowhere to be found beyond the\r\npale of the Mormon Church--and there are severe penalties for mixing\r\nthe blood of Shem and Japhet with the accursed race of Cain and Canaan.\r\nThe humanity of the Prophet’s followers to the Lamanite has been\r\ndistorted by Gentiles into a deep and dangerous project for “training\r\nthe Indians” to assassinate individual enemies, and, if necessary, to\r\nact as guerrillas against the Eastern invaders. That the Yutas--they\r\ndivide the white world into two great classes, Mormon and Shwop, or\r\nAmerican generally--would, in case of war, “stand by” their patrons, I\r\ndo not doubt; but this would only be the effect of kindness, which it\r\nis unfair to attribute to no worthier cause.\r\n\r\n  [134] Second Book of Nephi, chap. xii., par. 12. Lemuel was the\r\n  brother of Nephi; and the word is used by autonomasia for the\r\n  Lamanites or Indians.\r\n\r\n  [135] The wording of the following act shows the spirit in which\r\n  slavery was proposed:\r\n\r\n  A PREAMBLE AND AN ACT FOR THE FARTHER RELIEF OF INDIAN SLAVES AND\r\n  PRISONERS.\r\n\r\n  “Whereas, by reason of the acquisition of Upper California and\r\n  New Mexico, and the subsequent organization of the Territorial\r\n  Governments of New Mexico and Utah by the acts of the Congress of\r\n  the United States, these territories have organized governments\r\n  within and upon what would otherwise be considered Indian territory,\r\n  and which really is Indian territory so far as the right of soil is\r\n  involved, thereby presenting the novel feature of a white legalized\r\n  government on Indian lands; and\r\n\r\n  “Whereas the laws of the United States in relation to intercourse\r\n  with Indians are designed for, and only applicable to, territories\r\n  and countries under the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United\r\n  States; and\r\n\r\n  “Whereas, from time immemorial, the practice of purchasing Indian\r\n  women and children of the Utah tribe of Indians by Mexican traders\r\n  has been indulged in and carried on by those respective people until\r\n  the Indians consider it an allowable traffic, and frequently offer\r\n  their prisoners or children for sale; and\r\n\r\n  “Whereas it is a common practice among these Indians to gamble away\r\n  their own children and women; and it is a well-established fact that\r\n  women and children thus obtained, or obtained by war, or theft, or\r\n  in any other manner, are by them frequently carried from place to\r\n  place, packed upon horses or mules, larieted out to subsist upon\r\n  grass, roots, or starve, and are frequently bound with thongs made\r\n  of raw-hide until their hands and feet become swollen, mutilated,\r\n  inflamed with pain, and wounded; and when with suffering, cold,\r\n  hunger, and abuse they fall sick, so as to become troublesome, are\r\n  frequently slain by their masters to get rid of them; and\r\n\r\n  “Whereas they do frequently kill their women and children taken\r\n  prisoners, either in revenge, or for amusement, or through the\r\n  influence of tradition, unless they are tempted to exchange them for\r\n  trade, which they usually do if they have an opportunity; and\r\n\r\n  “Whereas one family frequently steals the children and women of\r\n  another family, and such robberies and murders are continually\r\n  committed, in times of their greatest peace and amity, thus dragging\r\n  free Indian women and children into Mexican servitude and slavery, or\r\n  death, to the almost entire extirpation of the whole Indian race; and\r\n\r\n  “Whereas these inhuman practices are being daily enacted before our\r\n  eyes in the midst of the white settlements, and within the organized\r\n  counties of the Territory; and when the inhabitants do not purchase\r\n  or trade for those so offered for sale, they are generally doomed to\r\n  the most miserable existence, suffering the tortures of every species\r\n  of cruelty, until death kindly relieves them and closes the revolting\r\n  scenery:\r\n\r\n  “Wherefore, when all these facts are taken into consideration, it\r\n  becomes the duty of all humane and Christian people to extend unto\r\n  this degraded and downtrodden race such relief as can be awarded to\r\n  them, according to their situation and circumstances; it therefore\r\n  becomes necessary to consider,\r\n\r\n  “First, the circumstances of our location among these savage tribes\r\n  under the authority of Congress, while yet the Indian title to the\r\n  soil is left unextinguished; not even a treaty having been held, by\r\n  which a partition of territory or country has been made, thereby\r\n  bringing them into our door-yards, our houses, and in contact with\r\n  our every avocation.\r\n\r\n  “Second, their situation, and our duty toward them, upon the common\r\n  principles of humanity.\r\n\r\n  “Third, the remedy, or what will be the most conducive to ameliorate\r\n  their condition, preserve their lives and their liberties, and redeem\r\n  them from a worse than African bondage; it suggests itself to your\r\n  committee that to memorialize Congress to provide by some act of\r\n  national legislation for the new and unparalleled situation of the\r\n  inhabitants of this Territory, in relation to their intercourse with\r\n  these Indians, would be one resource, prolific in its results for our\r\n  mutual benefit; and, farther, that we ask their concurrence in the\r\n  following enactment, passed by the Legislature of the Territory of\r\n  Utah, January 31, A.D. 1852, entitled,\r\n\r\n  “‘_An Act for the Relief of Indian Slaves and Prisoners_.\r\n\r\n  “‘Sec. 1. Be it enacted by the Governor and Legislative Assembly of\r\n  the Territory of Utah, That whenever any white person within any\r\n  organized county of this Territory shall have any Indian prisoner,\r\n  child, or woman, in his possession, whether by purchase or otherwise,\r\n  such person shall immediately go, together with such Indian prisoner,\r\n  child, or woman, before the selectmen or probate judge of the county.\r\n  If, in the opinion of the selectmen or probate judge, the person\r\n  having such Indian prisoner, child, or woman, is a suitable person,\r\n  and properly qualified to raise or retain and educate said Indian\r\n  prisoner, child, or woman, it shall be his or their duty to bind out\r\n  the same, by indenture, for the term of not exceeding twenty years,\r\n  at the discretion of the judge or selectmen.\r\n\r\n  “‘Sec. 2. The probate judge or selectmen shall cause to be written in\r\n  the indenture the name and age, place where born, name of parents if\r\n  known, tribe to which said Indian person belonged, name of the person\r\n  having him in possession, name of Indian from whom said person was\r\n  obtained, date of the indenture--a copy of which shall be filed in\r\n  the probate clerk’s office.\r\n\r\n  “‘Sec. 3. The selectmen in their respective counties are hereby\r\n  authorized to obtain such Indian prisoners, children, or women, and\r\n  bind them to some useful avocation.\r\n\r\n  “‘Sec. 4. The master to whom the indenture is made is hereby required\r\n  to send said apprentice to school, if there be a school in the\r\n  district or vicinity, for the term of three months in each year, at a\r\n  time when said Indian child shall be between the ages of seven years\r\n  and sixteen. The master shall clothe his apprentice in a comfortable\r\n  and becoming manner, according to his said master’s condition in life.\r\n\r\n  “‘Approved March 7, 1852.’”\r\n\r\nThe conversation, which lasted about an hour, ended by the Prophet\r\nasking me the line of my last African exploration, and whether it was\r\nthe same country traversed by Dr. Livingstone. I replied that it was\r\nabout ten degrees north of the Zambezi. Mr. A. Carrington rose to point\r\nout the place upon a map which hung against the wall, and placed his\r\nfinger too near the equator, when Mr. Brigham Young said, “A little\r\nlower down.” There are many educated men in England who could not\r\nhave corrected the mistake as well: witness the “London Review,” in\r\nwhich the gentleman who “does the geography”--not having the fear of a\r\ncertain society in Whitehall Place before his eyes--confounds, in all\r\nthe pomp of criticism upon the said exploration, lakes which are not\r\nless than 200 miles apart.\r\n\r\n[THE PROPHET NO COMMON MAN.]\r\n\r\nWhen conversation began to flag, we rose up, shook hands, as is the\r\ncustom here, all round, and took leave. The first impression left upon\r\nmy mind by this short _séance_, and it was subsequently confirmed,\r\nwas, that the Prophet is no common man, and that he has none of the\r\nweakness and vanity which characterize the common uncommon man. A\r\ndesultory conversation can not be expected to draw out a master\r\nspirit, but a truly distinguished character exercises most often an\r\ninstinctive--some would call it a mesmeric--effect upon those who come\r\nin contact with it; and as we hate or despise at first sight, and\r\nlove or like at first sight, so Nature teaches us at first sight what\r\nto respect. It is observable that, although every Gentile writer has\r\nrepresented Mr. Joseph Smith as a heartless impostor, few have ventured\r\nto apply the term to Mr. Brigham Young. I also remarked an instance\r\nof the veneration shown by his followers, whose affection for him is\r\nequaled only by the confidence with which they intrust to him their\r\ndearest interests in this world and in the next. After my visit many\r\ncongratulated me, as would the followers of the Tien Wong, or heavenly\r\nKing, upon having at last seen what they consider “a per se” the most\r\nremarkable man in the world.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the Prophet’s Block I will describe the rest of\r\nthe building. The grounds are surrounded by a high wall of large\r\npebble-like stones and mortar--the lime now used is very bad--and\r\nstrengthened with semicircular buttresses. The main entrance faces\r\nsouth, with posts and chains before it for tethering horses. The “Lion\r\nHouse,” occupied by Mrs. Young and her family, is in the eastern\r\npart of the square: it is so called from a stone lion placed over\r\nthe large pillared portico, the work of a Mr. William Ward, who also\r\ncut the block of white limestone, with “Deserét” beneath a bee-hive,\r\nand other symbols, forwarded for the Washington Monument in 1853.\r\nIt is lamentable to state that the sculptor is now an apostate. The\r\nhouse resembles a two-storied East Indian tenement, with balcony and\r\nbalustrade, here called an observatory, and is remarkable by its\r\nchunamed coat; it cost $65,000--being the best in the city, and was\r\nfinished in one year. Before building it the Prophet lived in the White\r\nHouse, a humbler bungalow farther to the east; he has now given it up\r\nto his son, Joseph A. Young.\r\n\r\nOn the west of the Lion House lies the private office in which we\r\nwere received, and farther westward, but adjoining and connected by a\r\npassage, is the public office, where the Church and other business is\r\ntransacted. This room, which is larger than the former, has three desks\r\non each side, the left on entering being those of the public, and the\r\nright those of the private clerks. The chief accountant is Mr. Daniel\r\nO’Calder, a Scotchman, whose sagacity in business makes him an _alter\r\nego_ of the President. At the end opposite the door there is a larger\r\n_pupitre_ railed off, and a gallery runs round the upper wall. The\r\nbookcases are of the yellow box-elder wood, which takes a fine polish;\r\nand all is neat, clean, and business-like.\r\n\r\nWestward of the public office is the Bee House, so named from the\r\nsculptured bee-hive in front of it. The Hymenopter is the Mormon\r\nsymbol of industry; moreover, Deserét (pronounced Des-erétt) is, in\r\n“reformed Egyptian,” the honey-bee; the term is applied with a certain\r\nviolence to Utah, where, as yet, that industrious insect is an utter\r\nstranger.[136] The Bee House is a large building, with the long walls\r\nfacing east and west. It is double storied, with the lower windows,\r\nwhich are barred, oblong: the upper, ten in number, are narrow, and\r\nshaded by a small acute ogive or gable over each. The color of the\r\nbuilding is a yellowish-white, which contrasts well with the green\r\nblinds, and the roof, which is acute, is tiled with shingles. It was\r\nfinished in 1845, and is tenanted by the “plurality wives” and their\r\nfamilies, who each have a bedroom, sitting-room, and closet simply and\r\nsimilarly furnished. There is a Moslem air of retirement about the\r\nBee House; the face of woman is rarely seen at the window, and her\r\nvoice is never heard from without. Anti-Mormons declare it to be, like\r\nthe state-prison at Auburn, a self-supporting establishment, for not\r\neven the wives of the Prophet are allowed to live in idleness.\r\n\r\n  [136] “And they (_scil._ Jared and his brother) did also carry with\r\n  them Deserét, which by interpretation is a honey-bee; and they did\r\n  carry with them swarms of bees, and all manner of that which was upon\r\n  the face of the land, seeds of every kind.”--_Book of Ether_, chap.\r\n  i., par. 3.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PROPHET’S BLOCK.]\r\n\r\n[THE PROPHET’S PROGENY.]\r\n\r\nI was unwilling to add to the number of those who had annoyed the\r\nProphet by domestic allusions, and therefore have no direct knowledge\r\nof the extent to which he carries polygamy; some Gentiles allow him\r\nseventeen, others thirty-six, out of a household of seventy members;\r\nothers an indefinite number of wives scattered through the different\r\nsettlements. Of these, doubtless, many are but wives by name, such,\r\nfor instance, as the widows of the late Prophet; and others are\r\nmarried more for the purpose of building up for themselves spiritual\r\nkingdoms than for the normal purpose of matrimony. When treating of\r\nMormon polygamy I shall attempt to show that the relation between the\r\nsexes as lately regulated by the Mormon faith necessitates polygamy. I\r\nshould judge the Prophet’s progeny to be numerous from the following\r\ncircumstance: On one occasion, when standing with him on the belvidere,\r\nmy eye fell upon a new erection: it could be compared externally to\r\nnothing but an English gentleman’s hunting stables, with their little\r\nclock-tower, and I asked him what it was intended for. “A private\r\nschool for my children,” he replied, “directed by Brother E. B.\r\nKelsey.” The harem is said to have cost $30,000.\r\n\r\n[TITHES.]\r\n\r\nOn the extreme west of this block, backed by a pound for estrays,\r\nwhich is no longer used, lies the Tithing House and Deserét Store,\r\na long, narrow, upper-storied building, with cellars, store-rooms,\r\nreceiving-rooms, pay-rooms, and writing offices. At this time of the\r\nyear it chiefly contains linseed, and rags for paper-making; after\r\nthe harvest it is well stuffed with grains and cereals, which are\r\ntaken instead of money payment. There is nothing more unpopular among\r\nthe American Gentiles, or, indeed, more unintelligible to them, than\r\nthese Mosaic tithes, which the English converts pay, from habit,\r\nwithout a murmur. They serve for scandalous insinuations, viz., that\r\nthe chiefs are leeches that draw the people’s golden blood; that the\r\nimposts are compulsory, and that they are embezzled and peculated by\r\nthe principal dignitaries. I have reason to believe that the contrary\r\nis the case. The tithes which are paid into the “Treasury of the Lord”\r\nupon the property of a Saint on profession, and afterward upon his\r\nannual income, or his time, or by substitute, are wholly voluntary.\r\nIt sometimes happens that a man casts his all into the bosom of the\r\nChurch; in this case the all is not refused, but--may I ask--by what\r\nChurch body, Islamitic, Christian, or pagan, would it be? If the\r\nProphet takes any thing from the Tithing House, he pays for it like\r\nother men. The writers receive stipends like other writers, and no\r\nmore; of course, if any one--clerk or lawyer--wishes to do the business\r\nof the Church gratis, he is graciously permitted; and where, I repeat,\r\nwould he not be? The Latter-Day Saints declare that if their first\r\nPresidency and Twelve Apostles--of whom some, by-the-by, are poor--grow\r\nrich, it is by due benevolence, not by force or fraud. Much like the\r\nprimitive college, and most unlike their successors in this modern\r\nday, each apostle must have some craft, and all live by handiwork,\r\neither in house, shop, or field, no drones being allowed in the social\r\nhive. The tithes are devoted in part to Church works, especially to\r\n“building up temples or otherwise beautifying and adorning Zion, as\r\nthey may be directed from on high,” and in part to the prosperity of\r\nthe body politic, temporal, and spiritual; by aiding faithful and needy\r\nemigrants, and by supporting old and needy Saints. Perhaps the only\r\ntrue charge brought by the Gentiles against this, and, indeed, against\r\nall the public funds in the Mormon City, is, that a large portion\r\nfinds its way eastward, and is expended in “outside influence,” or,\r\nto speak plain English, bribes. It is believed by Mormons as well as\r\nGentiles that Mr. Brigham Young has in the States newspaper spies and\r\ninfluential political friends, who are attached to him not only by the\r\nties of business and the natural respect felt for a wealthy man, but\r\nby the strong bond of a regular stipend. And such is their reliance\r\nupon this political dodgery--which, if it really exists, is by no means\r\nhonorable to the public morality of the Gentiles--that they deride the\r\nidea of a combined movement from Washington ever being made against\r\nthem. In 1860 Governor Cumming proposed to tax the tithing fund; but\r\nthe Saints replied that, as property is first taxed and then tithed, by\r\nsuch proceeding it would be twice taxed.\r\n\r\n“This people”--a term reiterated at Great Salt Lake City _usque ad\r\nnauseam_--declares its belief “in being subject to kings, queen,\r\npresidents, rulers, and magistrates; in obeying, honoring, and\r\nsustaining the law.” They are not backward in open acts of loyalty--I\r\nbeg America’s pardon--of adhesion to the Union, such as supplying\r\nstones for the Washington Monument and soldiers for the Mexican\r\nWar. But they make scant pretension of patriotism. They regard the\r\nStates pretty much as the States regarded England after the War\r\nof Independence, and hate them as the Mexican Criollo does the\r\nGachupin--very much also for the same reason. Theirs is a deep and\r\nabiding resentment, which time will strengthen, not efface: the\r\ndeeds of Missouri and Illinois will bear fruit for many and many\r\na generation. The federal government, they say, has, so far from\r\nprotecting their lives and property, left them to be burned out and\r\ndriven away by the hands of a mob, far more cruel than the “red-coated\r\nminions” of poor King George; that Generals Harney and Johnston were\r\nonly seeking the opportunity to act Burgoyne and Cornwallis. But,\r\nmore galling still to human nature, whether of saint or sinner, they\r\nare despised, “treated, in fact, as nobodies”--and that last of\r\ninsults who can bear? Their petitions to become a sovereign state have\r\nbeen unanswered and ignored. They have been served with “small-fry”\r\npoliticians and “one-horse” officials: hitherto the phrase has been,\r\n“Any thing is good enough for Utah!” They return the treatment in kind.\r\n\r\n[NEW INDEPENDENCE DAY.]\r\n\r\n“The Old Independence,” the “glorious” 4th of July, ’76, is treated\r\nwith silent contempt: its honors are transferred to the 24th of July,\r\nthe local Independence Day of their _annus mirabilis_ 1847, when the\r\nweary pioneers, preceding a multitude, which, like the Pilgrim fathers\r\nof New England, left country and home for conscience’ sake, and, led\r\nby Captain John Brown, whose unerring rifle saved them from starvation\r\nwhen the Indians had stampeded their horses, arrived in the wild waste\r\nof valley. Their form of government, which I can describe only as\r\na democratic despotism with a leaven of the true Mosaic theocracy,\r\nenables them to despise a political system in which they say--quoting\r\nHamilton--that “every vital interest of the state is merged in the\r\nall-absorbing question of ‘who shall be the next president.’” There is\r\nonly one “Yankee gridiron” in the town, and that is a private concern.\r\nI do not remember ever seeing a liberty-pole, that emblem of a tyrant\r\nmajority, which has been bowed to from New York to the Rhine.[137]\r\nA favorite toast on public occasions is, “We can rock the cradle of\r\nLiberty without Uncle Sam to help us,” and so forth. These sentiments\r\nshow how the wind sets. In two generations hence--perhaps New Zion has\r\na prophet-making air--the Mormons in their present position will, on\r\ntheir own ground, be more than a match for the Atlantic, and, combined\r\nwith the Chinese, will be dangerous to the Pacific States.\r\n\r\n  [137] The first liberty-pole was erected on the open space between\r\n  the Court-house and Broadway, New York. It is a long flag-staff,\r\n  often of several pieces, like the “mast of some tall ammiral,”\r\n  surmounted by a liberty-cap, that Phrygian or Mithridatic coiffure\r\n  with which the Goddess of Liberty is supposed to disfigure herself.\r\n  With a peculiar inconsequence, “the whole is” said to be “an allusion\r\n  to Gesler’s cap which Tell refused to do homage to, leading to the\r\n  freedom of Switzerland.”--_Bartlett._ The French soon made of their\r\n  _peuplier_ a _peuple lié_. The Americans, curious to say, still\r\n  believe in it.\r\n\r\nThe Mormons, if they are any thing in secular politics, are Democrats.\r\nIt has not been judged advisable to cast off the last rags of popular\r\ngovernment, but, as will presently appear, theocracy is not much\r\ndisguised by them. Although not of the black or extreme category, they\r\ninstinctively feel that polygamy and slavery are sister institutions,\r\nclaiming that sort of kindness which arises from fellow-feeling, and\r\nthat Congress can not attack one without infringing upon the other.\r\nHere, perhaps, they may be mistaken, for nations, like individuals,\r\nhowever warmly and affectionately they love their own peculiar follies\r\nand prejudices, sins and crimes, are not the less, indeed perhaps they\r\nare rather more, disposed to abominate the follies and prejudices,\r\nthe sins and crimes of others. The establishment of slavery, however,\r\nthough here it serves a humanitarian rather than a private end,\r\nnecessarily draws the Mormons and the Southern States together. Yet the\r\nSaints preferred as President the late Mr. Senator Douglas, a Northern\r\nDemocrat, to his Southern rival, Mr. Breckinridge. They looked with\r\napprehension of the rise to power of the Republican party, which, had\r\nnot a weightier matter fallen into their hands, was pledged to do them\r\na harm. I can not but think that absolute independence is and will be,\r\nuntil attained, the principal end and aim of Mormon _haute politique_,\r\nand when the disruption of the Great Republic shall have become a _fait\r\naccompli_, that Deserét will arise a free, sovereign, and independent\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n[MORALS.--ARDENT SPIRITS.]\r\n\r\nShould this event ever happen, it will make the regions about Great\r\nSalt Lake as exclusive as Northern China or Eastern Tibet. The obsolete\r\nrigors of the sanguinary Mosaic code will be renewed in the middle\r\nof the nineteenth century, while the statute-crime “bigamy” and\r\nunlimited polygamy will be legalized. Stripes, or, at best, fine and\r\nimprisonment, will punish fornication, and the penalty of adultery will\r\nbe death by lapidation or beheading. As it is, even under the shadow of\r\nthe federal laws, the self-convicted breaker of the seventh commandment\r\nwill, it is said, offer up his life in expiation of his crime to the\r\nProphet, who, under present circumstances, dismisses him with a penance\r\nthat may end in the death which he has legally incurred. The offenses\r\nagainst chastity, morality, and decency are exceptionally severe.[138]\r\nThe penalty attached to betting of any kind is a fine not exceeding\r\n$300, or imprisonment not exceeding six months. The importation of\r\nspirituous liquors is already burdened with an octroi of half its\r\nprice, raising cognac and whisky to $12 and $8 per gallon. If the state\r\ncould make her own laws, she would banish “poteen,” hunt down the\r\nstills, and impose a prohibitory duty upon every thing stronger than\r\nLager-bier.[139]\r\n\r\n  [138] Sec. 32 (of an “Act in relation to Crimes and Punishment”).\r\n  Every person who commits the crime of adultery shall be punished by\r\n  imprisonment not exceeding twenty years, and not less than three\r\n  years; or by fine not exceeding one thousand dollars, and not less\r\n  than three hundred dollars; or by both fine and imprisonment, at the\r\n  discretion of the court. And when the crime is committed between\r\n  parties any one of whom is married, both are guilty of adultery, and\r\n  shall be punished accordingly. No prosecution for adultery can be\r\n  commenced but on the complaint of the husband or wife.\r\n\r\n  Sec. 33. If any man or woman, not being married to each other, lewdly\r\n  and lasciviously associate and cohabit together; or if any man or\r\n  woman, married or unmarried, is guilty of open and gross lewdness,\r\n  and designedly make any open and indecent, or obscene exposure of\r\n  his or her person, or of the person of another, every such person so\r\n  offending shall be punished by imprisonment not exceeding ten years,\r\n  and not less than six months, and fine not more than one thousand\r\n  dollars, and not less than one hundred dollars, or both, at the\r\n  discretion of the court.\r\n\r\n  Sec. 34. If any person keep a house of ill-fame, resorted to for\r\n  the purpose of prostitution or lewdness, he shall be punished by\r\n  imprisonment not exceeding ten years, and not less than one year,\r\n  or by fine not exceeding five hundred dollars, or both fine and\r\n  imprisonment. And any person who, after being once convicted of such\r\n  offense, is again convicted of the like offense, shall be punished\r\n  not more than double the above specified penalties.\r\n\r\n  Sec. 35. If any person inveigle or entice any female, before reputed\r\n  virtuous, to a house of ill-fame, or knowingly conceal, aid, or abet\r\n  in concealing such female so deluded or enticed, for the purpose of\r\n  prostitution or lewdness, he shall be punished by imprisonment not\r\n  more than fifteen years, nor less than five years.\r\n\r\n  Sec. 36. If any person without lawful authority willfully dig up,\r\n  disinter, remove, or carry any human body, or the remains thereof,\r\n  from its place of interment, or aid or assist in so doing, or\r\n  willfully receive, conceal, or dispose of any such human body, or the\r\n  remains thereof; or if any person willfully or unnecessarily, and in\r\n  an improper manner, indecently exposes those remains, or abandons\r\n  any human body, or the remains thereof, in any public place, or in\r\n  any river, stream, pond, or other place, every such offender shall\r\n  be punished by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by fine not\r\n  exceeding one thousand dollars, or by both fine and imprisonment, at\r\n  the discretion of the court.\r\n\r\n  Sec. 37. If any person torture or cruelly beat any horse, ox, or\r\n  other beast, whether belonging to himself or another, he shall be\r\n  punished by fine not more than one hundred dollars.\r\n\r\n  Sec. 38. If any person import, print, publish, sell, or distribute\r\n  any book, pamphlet, ballad, or any printed paper containing obscene\r\n  language, or obscene prints, pictures, or descriptions manifestly\r\n  tending to corrupt the morals of youth, or introduce into any family,\r\n  school, or place of education, or buy, procure, receive, or have\r\n  in his possession any such book, pamphlet, ballad, printed paper,\r\n  picture, or description, either for the purpose of loan, sale,\r\n  exhibition, or circulation, or with intent to introduce the same into\r\n  any family, school, or place of education, he shall be punished by\r\n  fine not exceeding four hundred dollars.\r\n\r\n  Sec. 39. If any person keep a house, shop, or place resorted to for\r\n  the purpose of gambling, or permit or suffer any person in any house,\r\n  shop, or other place under his control or care to play at cards,\r\n  dice, faro, roulette, or other game for money or other things, such\r\n  offender shall be fined not more than eight hundred dollars, or\r\n  imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both, at the discretion of\r\n  the court. In a prosecution under this section, any person who has\r\n  the charge of, or attends to any such house, shop, or place, may be\r\n  deemed the keeper thereof.\r\n\r\n  [139] I quote as an authority,\r\n\r\n  _An Ordinance regulating the Manufacturing and Vending of Ardent\r\n  Spirits_.\r\n\r\n  Sec. 1. Be it ordained by the General Assembly of the State of\r\n  Deserét, That it shall not be lawful for any person or persons in\r\n  this state to establish any distillery or distilleries for the\r\n  manufacture of ardent spirits except as hereafter provided for;\r\n  and any person or persons who shall violate this ordinance, on\r\n  conviction thereof, shall forfeit all property thus invested to the\r\n  state, and be liable to a fine at the discretion of the court having\r\n  jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n  Sec. 2. Be it farther ordained, That when the governor shall deem it\r\n  expedient to have ardent spirits manufactured within this state, he\r\n  may grant a license to some person or persons to make and vend the\r\n  same, and impose such restrictions thereon as he may deem requisite.\r\n\r\n  Approved Feb. 12, 1851.\r\n\r\n[JUDGE PHELPS.]\r\n\r\nOn the saddest day of the year for the bird which has lost so much good\r\nfame by condescending to appear at table _aux choux_, I proceeded with\r\nmy _fidus Achates_--save the self-comparison to pious Æneas--on a visit\r\nto Mr. W. W., alias Judge Phelps, alias “the Devil.” He received me\r\nwith great civility, and entered without reserve upon his hobbies. His\r\nhouse, which lies west of Temple Block, bears on the weathercock ‏הננו‎\r\n(Job, xxxviii., 35, “Adsumus:” “Here we are”). Besides Hebrew and other\r\nlinguistic studies, the judge is a meteorologist, and has been engaged\r\nfor some years in observations upon the climate of the Territory. An\r\nold editor at Independence, he now superintends the Utah Almanac, and\r\ngave me a copy for the year 1860, “being the 31st year of the Church of\r\nJesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.” It is a small duodecimo, creditably\r\nprinted by Mr. J. M‘Knight, Utah, and contains thirty-two pages. The\r\ncontents are the usual tables of days, sunrises, sunsets, eclipses,\r\netc., with advertisements on the alternate pages; and it ends with the\r\ndenominations and value of gold and silver coins, original poetry,\r\n“scientific” notes concerning the morning and evening stars, a list\r\nof the United States officers at Utah, the number of the planets and\r\nasteroids, diarrhœa, and “moral poetry,” and an explanation of the word\r\n“almanac,” concluding with the following observation:\r\n\r\n  “A person, without an almanac is somewhat like a ship at sea without\r\n  a compass; he never knows what to do nor when to do it.”\r\n\r\n    “So Mormon, other sects, and Quaker,\r\n    Buy Almanacs, and pay the maker.--K. J.”\r\n\r\nThe only signs of sanctity are in the events appended to the days of\r\nthe week; they naturally record the dates of local interest, and the\r\nbirths and deaths of prophets and patriarchs, presidents and apostles.\r\nUnder the head of “Time,” however, some novel information is provided\r\nfor the benefit of the benighted chronologist.\r\n\r\n  “TIME.--There is a great mystery about time as recorded in the Bible.\r\n  Authors differ as to what length of time this world has occupied\r\n  since it came into being. Add 4004 to 1860, and we have 5864 years.\r\n\r\n  “Again, some authors allow, before the birth of the Savior, 5509\r\n  years, which, added to 1860, gives 7369 years since the beginning.\r\n\r\n  “The book of Abraham, as translated by Joseph Smith, gives 7000 years\r\n  for the creation by the gods, one day of the Lord being a thousand\r\n  years of man’s time, or a day in Kolob. This important revelation of\r\n  7000 years at first shows 5960 years since the transgression of Adam\r\n  and Eve, and 40 years to the next ‘day of rest,’ if the year 1900\r\n  commences the return of the ‘ten tribes,’ and the first resurrection;\r\n  or 13,000 years since the gods said, ‘Let there be light, and there\r\n  was light,’ so that the fourteen thousandth year will be the second\r\n  Sabbath since creation.\r\n\r\n  “A day of the Moon is nearly thirty of our days, or more than ten\r\n  thousand of earth’s time. Verily, verily,\r\n\r\n    “Man knows but little,\r\n      Nor knows that little right.”\r\n\r\nThe judge then showed me an instrument upon which he had expended the\r\nthought and labor of years: it was that grand desideratum, a magnetic\r\ncompass, which, pointing with a second needle to the true north, would\r\nindicate variation so correctly as to show longitude by inspection. The\r\narticle, which was as rough-looking as it could be, was placed upon\r\nthe table; but it would not, as the inventor explained, point to the\r\ntrue north unless in a particular position. I refrain from recording\r\nmy hundred doubts as to the feasibility of the operation, and my own\r\nsuspicions concerning the composition of the instrument. I presently\r\ntook leave of Judge Phelps, pleased with his quaint kindness, but\r\nsomehow suspecting him of being a little _tête-montée_ on certain\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\n[THE “DESERÉT NEWS.”--NEWSPAPERS.]\r\n\r\nAs it was newspaper day, we passed by the “Mountaineer” office and\r\nbought a copy. The press is ably and extensively represented in\r\nGreat Salt Lake City, as in any other of its Western coevals.[140]\r\nMormonism, so far from despising the powers of pica, has a more than\r\nordinary respect for them.[141] Until lately there were three weekly\r\nnewspapers. The “Valley Tan,” however, during the last winter expired,\r\nafter a slow and lingering dysthesis, induced by overindulgence in\r\nGentile tendencies. It was established in 1858; the proprietor was\r\nMr. J. Hartnett, the late federal secretary; the editor was Mr. Kirk\r\nAnderson, followed by Mr. De Wolf and others; the issue hebdomadal, and\r\nthe subscription high = $10 per annum. The recognized official organ\r\nof the religion, which first appeared on the 15th of June, 1850, is\r\nthe “Deserét News,” whose motto is “Truth and Liberty” under a hive,\r\nover which is a single circumradiated eye in disagreeable proximity to\r\nthe little busy bee. It has often changed its size, and is now printed\r\nin small folio, of eight pages, each containing four columns of close\r\ntype: sometimes articles are clothed in the Mormon alphabet. It had\r\nreached in 1860 its tenth volume; it appears every Wednesday; costs at\r\nUtah $6 per annum, in England £1 13_s._ 8_d._ per annum, in advance;\r\nsingle number 9_d._; and is superintended by Mr. Brigham Young. It is\r\nedited by Mr. Elias Smith, also a Probate judge; he is assisted by Mr.\r\nM‘Knight, formerly the editor of a paper in the United States, and now\r\nthe author of the important horticultural, agricultural, and other\r\ngeorgic articles in the “Deserét News.” This “Moniteur” also contains\r\ncorrected reports of the sermons spoken at the Tabernacle. An account\r\nof a number may not be uninteresting.\r\n\r\n  [140] According to the “Elgin Courant,” there are between 700 and 800\r\n  of a fishing population in Hopeness who never see a newspaper.\r\n\r\n  [141] The first Mormon newspaper was the “Latter-Day Saints’\r\n  Messenger and Advocate,” published at Kirtland, Ohio, in the time of\r\n  Mr. Joseph Smith.\r\n\r\n  The “Evening and Morning Star,” published at Independence, Mo., and\r\n  edited by W. W. Phelps.\r\n\r\n  “Elders’ Journal,” published in 1838, in the time of Mr. Joseph Smith.\r\n\r\n  “The Upper Missouri Advertiser,” published about the same time; it\r\n  did not last long.\r\n\r\n  “The Nauvoo Neighbor” disappeared in the days of the Exodus.\r\n\r\n  “The Times and Seasons,” containing a compendium of intelligence\r\n  pertaining to the upbuilding of the kingdom of God, and the signs of\r\n  the Times, together with a great variety of information in regard\r\n  to the history, principles, persecutions, deliverances, and onward\r\n  progress of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Nauvoo\r\n  1839-1843. It was edited by Elder John Taylor (now one of the\r\n  “Twelve”) under the direction of Mr. Joseph Smith, and arrived at the\r\n  fourth volume (octavo): this journal is full of interesting matter to\r\n  Mormons.\r\n\r\n  “The Wasp,” begun at Nauvoo in 1842.\r\n\r\n  “The Frontier Garden,” published at Council Bluffs during the Exodus\r\n  from Nauvoo.\r\n\r\n  “The Seer,” edited at Washington, by Elder Orson Pratt, reached the\r\n  second volume.\r\n\r\n  “The Gospel Reflector,” published at Philadelphia, lasted for a short\r\n  time.\r\n\r\n  “The Prophet,” published at New York.\r\n\r\n  “Le Reflecteur,” in French, published at Geneva.\r\n\r\n  “Etoile du Deserét, Organe de l’Eglise de Jésus-Christ des Saints des\r\n  Derniers Jours,” par John Taylor, Paris. It lasted from May, 1851, to\r\n  April, 1852, and forms 1 vol. large 8vo, containing 192 pages.\r\n\r\n  “The Western Standard,” edited and published weekly at San Francisco,\r\n  California, United States of America, by Elder George Q. Cannon, now\r\n  an Apostle and President of the Church in Great Britain. This paper,\r\n  which was distinguished by the beauty of its type and the character\r\n  of its composition, lasted through 1856 and 1857; in 1858 it ceased\r\n  for want of funds.\r\n\r\n  “Zion’s Watchman,” published in Australia.\r\n\r\n  “Udgorn Seion” (the Trump of Zion), published in Wales, a bi-monthly\r\n  print, which has reached the ninth volume.\r\n\r\n  “The Luminary,” St. Louis, Mo.\r\n\r\n  “The Mormon,” published in New York, a hebdomadal print.\r\n\r\nNo. 28, vol. x., begins with a hymn of seven stanzas, by C. W. Bryant.\r\nFollow remarks by President Brigham Young, at Provo and in the Bowery,\r\nGreat Salt Lake City; the three sermons, which occupy four columns and\r\na half, are separated by “Modern Germany, II.,” by Alexander Ott. There\r\nis an article from the “New York Sun,” entitled the “Great Eastern in\r\nCourt.” It is followed by nearly half a page of “Clippings,” those\r\nlittle recognized piracies which make the American papers as amusing\r\nas magazines. Then come advertisements, estray notices, and others,\r\nwhich nearly fill the third and sixth pages, and the column at the\r\neighth, which is the conclusion. I subjoin terms for advertising.[142]\r\nThe fourth page contains “News by Eastern Mail”--Doings of the\r\nProbate Court--Special term of the Probate Court--Another excusable\r\nhomicide--The season--Imprisoning convicts without labor--Discharge of\r\nthe city police--Swiss Saints (lately arrived)--Arrival of missionaries\r\nat Liverpool--Drowned, Joseph Vest, etc.--Deserét Agriculturing and\r\nManufacturing Society--Information wanted -- and Humboldt’s opinion\r\nof the United States (comparing it to a Cartesian vortex, liberty a\r\ndead machinery in the hands of Utilitarianism, etc.). The fifth and\r\nsixth pages detail news from Europe, the Sicilies, Damascus, and India,\r\nproceedings of a missionary meeting in the Bowery, and tidings from\r\nJuab and Iron County, with a few stopgaps, such as an explanation of\r\nthe word Zouave, and the part conversion of the fallen Boston elm\r\ninto a “Mayor’s seat.” The seventh page is agricultural, and opens\r\nwith the “American Autumn,” by Fanny Kemble, four stanzas. Then comes\r\nSheep-husbandry No. iii., treating of change of pasture, separation of\r\nthe flock, and fall management. The other _morceaux_ are “Training\r\nthe peach-tree,” “Stick to the Farm,” an article concluding with “We\r\nshall always sign ‘speed the plow;’ we shall always regard the American\r\nfarmer, dressed for his employment (!) and tilling his grounds, as\r\nbelonging to the order of real noblemen”--the less aristocratic\r\nEnglander would limit himself to “Nature’s gentleman;” “Why pork\r\nshrinks in the pot,” and “Wheat-straw, its value as fodder.” The eighth\r\nand last page opens with “Correspondence,” and a letter signed Joseph\r\nHall, headed “More results of ‘civilization,’” and dated Ogden City,\r\nSept. 8, 1860. It contains an account of occurrences resulting in the\r\n“death of one John Cornwell, a discharged government teamster, and,\r\nas is often the case with those Christians who are sent to civilize\r\nthe ‘Mormons’ of these mountains, a corrupt, profane, and quarrelsome\r\nindividual, who doted on belonging to the ‘bully tribe.’” Then\r\nfollows more news from San Pete County. A test of love (that capital\r\nstory out of C. R. Leslie’s autobiography). Siege of Magdeburg. A\r\nhard-shell sermon (preached at Oxford, England), a scrap illustrating\r\nthe marvelous growth of Quincy, Illinois, and the Legend of the origin\r\nof the Piano-forte. The latter is followed by a valuable abstract\r\ncontaining a summary of meteorological observations, barometric and\r\nthermometric, for the month of August, 1860, at Great Salt Lake City,\r\nUtah, by W.

There are no marriages, and the\r\nWestern papers, like those of the East, are still _bégueules_ enough\r\nto consider advertising the birth of a child indelicate; at least that\r\nwas the reason given to me. The last column contains the terms for\r\nadvertising and the “fill-up” advertisements.\r\n\r\n  [142] ADVERTISING.--Ten lines or less constitute one square.\r\n\r\n  _Regular Advertisements._\r\n\r\n  One quarter column (four squares or less), for each insertion  $1 50\r\n  Half column (seven squares or less), each insertion             3 00\r\n  One column (fourteen squares or less)                           6 00\r\n\r\n  _Sundry Advertisements._\r\n\r\n  One   square, each insertion  $1 00\r\n  Two      „           „         1 50\r\n  Three    „           „         2 00\r\n\r\n  Thus upward, with half a dollar to the additional square for each\r\n  insertion.\r\n\r\n  [143]\r\n\r\n  The maximum of the barometer   during the month is 26·100; min. 25·400\r\n   „     „       „   thermometer      „        „     95° F.;  „   60° F.\r\n\r\n  There fell of rain water 0·670 inches during five days marked\r\n  showery.

It appears\r\non Saturdays, and the terms of subscription are $6 per annum; the\r\noccasional supplement is issued gratis. It formerly belonged to three\r\nlawyers, Messrs. Stout, Blair, and Ferguson; it has now passed into\r\nthe hands of the two latter. Mr. Hosea Stout distinguished himself\r\nduring the Nauvoo troubles; he was the captain of forty policemen who\r\nwatched over the safety of Mr. Joseph Smith, and afterward went on\r\nmissions to India and China. Major S. M. Blair served under General\r\nSam. Houston in the Texan war of independence, and was a distinguished\r\nlawyer in the Southern States. A description of the “Deserét News”\r\nwill apply to the “Mountaineer.” I notice in the issue of September\r\n15, 1860, that a correspondent, quoting an extract from the “New York\r\nTribune”--the great Republican organ, and therefore no favorite with\r\nthe Mormons--says, outspokenly enough to please any amount of John\r\nBull, “The author of the above is a most consummate liar”--so far, so\r\ngood--“and a contemptible dastardly poltroon”--which is invidious.\r\n\r\nI passed the morning of the ensuing Sunday in a painful but appropriate\r\nexercise, reading the Books of Mormon and of Moroni the Prophet.\r\nSome writers tell me that it is the best extant imitation of the Old\r\nTestament; to me it seems composed only to emulate the sprightliness\r\nof some parts of Leviticus. Others declare that it is founded upon a\r\nromance composed by a Rev. Mr. Spaulding; if so, Mr. Spaulding must\r\nhave been like Prince Puckler-Muskau of traveling notoriety, a romancer\r\nutterly without romance. Surely there never was a book so thoroughly\r\ndull and heavy: it is monotonous as a sage-prairie. Though not liable\r\nto be terrified by dry or hard reading, I was, it is only fair to\r\nown, unable to turn over more than a few chapters at a time, and my\r\nconviction is that very few are so highly gifted that they have been\r\nable to read it through at a heat. In Mormonism it now holds the same\r\nlocus as the Bible in the more ignorant Roman Catholic countries, where\r\nreligious reading is chiefly restricted to the Breviary, to tales of\r\nmiracles, and to legends of Saints Ursula and Bridget. It is strictly\r\nproper, does not contain a word about materialism and polygamy[144]--in\r\nfact, more than one wife is strictly forbidden even in the Book\r\nof Doctrines and Covenants.[145] The Mormon Bible, therefore, is\r\nlaid aside for later and lighter reading. In one point it has done\r\nsomething. America, like Africa, is a continent of the future; the Book\r\nof Mormon has created for it an historical and miraculous past.\r\n\r\n  [144] Behold the Lamanites (North American Indians), your brethren,\r\n  whom ye hate because of their filthiness, and the cursings which hath\r\n  come upon their skins, are more righteous than you, for they have\r\n  not forgotten the commandment of the Lord, which was given unto our\r\n  fathers, that they should have, save it were one wife; and concubines\r\n  they should have none; and there should not be whoredoms committed\r\n  among them.--_Book of Jacob_, chap. ii., par. 9.\r\n\r\n  [145] See Chap. IX.\r\n\r\n[THE BOWERY.--MUSIC.]\r\n\r\nAt 9 45 A.M. we entered the Bowery; it is advisable to go early if\r\nseats within hearing are required. The place was a kind of “hangar,”\r\nabout a hundred feet long by the same breadth, with a roofing of\r\nbushes and boughs supported by rough posts, and open for ventilation\r\non the sides; it can contain about 3000 souls. The congregation is\r\naccommodated upon long rows of benches, opposite the dais, rostrum,\r\nplatform, or tribune, which looked like a long lane of boarding open\r\nto the north, where it faced the audience, and entered by steps from\r\nthe east. Between the people and the platform was a place not unlike a\r\nMethodist “pen” at a camp-meeting: this was allotted to the orchestra,\r\na violin, a bass, two women and four men performers, who sang the\r\nsweet songs of Zion tolerably well--decidedly well, after a moment’s\r\nreflection as to latitude and longitude, and after reminiscences\r\nof country and town chapels in that land where it is said, had the\r\nPsalmist heard his own psalms,\r\n\r\n    “In furious mood he would have tore ’em.”\r\n\r\nI was told that “profane”--_i. e._, operatic and other--music is\r\nperformed at worship, as in the Italian cathedrals, where they are\r\nunwilling that Sathanas should monopolize the prettiest airs; on this\r\noccasion, however, only hymns were sung.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOUTH END OF THE TABERNACLE.]\r\n\r\n[DRESS.]\r\n\r\nWe--the judge’s son and I--took our seats on the benches of the eighth\r\nward, where we could see the congregation flocking in, a proceeding\r\nwhich was not over--some coming from considerable distances--till\r\n10 15 A.M. The people were all _endimanchés_; many a pretty face\r\npeeped from the usual sun-bonnet with its long curtain, though the\r\n“mushroom” and the “pork-pie” had found their way over the plains,\r\nand trim figures were clad in neat stuff dresses, sometimes silk: in\r\nvery few cases there was a little faded finery--gauze, feathers, and\r\ngaudy colors--such as one may see on great festivals in an Old-Country\r\nvillage. The men were as decently attired: the weather, being hot, had\r\ncaused many of them to leave their coats at home, and to open their\r\nvests; the costume, however, looked natural to working-men, and there\r\nwas no want of cleanliness, such as sometimes lurks behind a bulwark\r\nof buttons. The elders and dignitaries on the platform affected coats\r\nof black broadcloth, and were otherwise respectably dressed. All\r\nwore their hats till the address began, and then all uncovered. By my\r\nside was the face of a blear-eyed English servant-girl; _en revanche_\r\nin front was a charming American mother and child: she had, what I\r\nhave remarked in Mormon meetings at Saville House and other places in\r\nEurope, an unusual development of the organ which phrenologists call\r\nveneration. I did not see any Bloomers “displaying a serviceable pair\r\nof brogues,” or “pictures of Grant Thorburn in petticoats.” There were\r\na few specimens of the “Yankee woman,” formerly wondrous grim, with a\r\nshrewd, thrifty gray eye, at once cold and eager, angular in body and\r\nmind, tall, bony, and square-shouldered, now softened and humanized by\r\ntransplantation and transposition to her proper place. The number of\r\nold people astonished me; half a dozen were sitting on the same bench;\r\nthese broken-down men and decrepit crones had come to lay their bones\r\nin the Holy City; their presence speaks equally well for their faith\r\nand for the kind-heartedness of those who had brought the encumbrance.\r\nI remarked some Gentiles in the Bowery; many, however, do not care to\r\nrisk what they may hear there touching themselves.\r\n\r\nAt 10 A.M. the meeting opened with a spiritual song. Then Mr.\r\nWallace--a civilized-looking man lately returned from foreign\r\ntravel--being called upon by the presiding elder for the day, opened\r\nthe meeting with prayer, of which the two short-hand writers in the\r\ntribune proceeded to take notes. The matter, as is generally the case\r\nwith returned missionaries delivering their budget, was good; the\r\nmanner was somewhat Hibernian; the “valleys of the mountains”--a stock\r\nphrase, appeared and reappeared like the speechifying Patlander’s\r\neternal “emerald green hills and beautiful pretty valleys.” He ended\r\nby imploring a blessing upon the (Mormon) President, and all those\r\nin authority; Gentiles of course were included. The conclusion was\r\nan amen, in which all hands joined: it reminded me of the historical\r\npractice of “humming” in the seventeenth century, which caused the\r\nuniversities to be called “_Hum et Hissimi auditores_.”\r\n\r\n[THE SERMON.]\r\n\r\nNext arose Bishop Abraham O. Smoot, second mayor of Zion, and successor\r\nto the late Jedediah M. Grant, who began with “Brethering,” and\r\nproceeded at first in a low and methody tone of voice, “hardly audible\r\nin the gallery,” to praise the Saints, and to pitch into the apostates.\r\nHis delivery was by no means fluent, even when he warmed. He made undue\r\nuse of the regular Wesleyan organ--the nose; but he appeared to speak\r\nexcellent sense in execrable English. He recalled past persecutions\r\nwithout over-asperity, and promised future prosperity without\r\nover-prophecy. As he was in the midst of an allusion to the President,\r\nentered Mr. Brigham Young, and all turned their faces, even the old\r\nlady--\r\n\r\n    “Peut-on si bien prêcher qu’elle ne dorme au sermon?”--\r\n\r\nwho, dear soul! from Hanover Square to far San Francisco, placidly\r\nreposes through the discourse.\r\n\r\nThe Prophet was dressed, as usual, in gray homespun and homewoven:\r\nhe wore, like most of the elders, a tall, steeple-crowned straw hat,\r\nwith a broad black ribbon, and he had the rare refinement of black\r\nkid gloves. He entered the tribune covered and sat down, apparently\r\ngreeting those near him. A man in a fit was carried out pumpward.\r\nBishop Smoot concluded with informing us that we should live for\r\nGod. Another hymn was sung. Then a great silence, which told us that\r\nsomething was about to happen: _that_ old man held his cough; _that_\r\nold lady awoke with a start; _that_ child ceased to squall. Mr. Brigham\r\nYoung removed his hat, advanced to the end of the tribune, expectorated\r\nstooping over the spittoon, which was concealed from sight by the\r\nboarding, restored the balance of fluid by a glass of water from a\r\nwell-filled decanter on the stand, and, leaning slightly forward upon\r\nboth hands propped on the green baize of the tribune, addressed his\r\nfollowers.\r\n\r\nThe discourse began slowly; word crept titubantly after word, and the\r\nopening phrases were hardly audible; but as the orator warmed, his\r\nvoice rose high and sonorous, and a fluency so remarkable succeeded\r\nfalter and hesitation, that--although the phenomenon is not rare in\r\nstrong speakers--the latter seemed almost to have been a work of art.\r\nThe manner was pleasing and animated, and the matter fluent, impromptu,\r\nand well turned, spoken rather than preached: if it had a fault it was\r\nrather rambling and unconnected. Of course, colloquialisms of all kinds\r\nwere introduced, such as “he become,” “for you and I,” and so forth.\r\nThe gestures were easy and rounded, not without a certain grace, though\r\nevidently untaught; one, however, must be excepted, namely, that of\r\nraising and shaking the forefinger; this is often done in the Eastern\r\nStates, but the rest of the world over it is considered threatening and\r\nbullying. The address was long. God is a mechanic. Mormonism is a great\r\nfact. Religion had made him (the speaker) the happiest of men. He was\r\nready to dance like a Shaker. At this sentence the Prophet, who is a\r\ngood mimic, and has much of the old New English quaint humor, raised\r\nhis right arm, and gave, to the amusement of the congregation, a droll\r\nimitation of Anne Lee’s followers. The Gentiles had sent an army to lay\r\nwaste Zion, and what had they done? Why, hung one of their own tribe!\r\nand that, too, on the Lord’s day![146] The Saints have a glorious\r\ndestiny before them, and their morality is remarkable as the beauty of\r\nthe Promised Land: the soft breeze blowing over the Bowery, and the\r\nglorious sunshine outside, made the allusion highly appropriate. The\r\nLamanites, or Indians, are a religious people. All races know a God and\r\nmay be saved. After a somewhat lengthy string of sentences concerning\r\nthe great tribulation coming on earth--it has been coming for the last\r\n1800 years--he concluded with good wishes to visitors and Gentiles\r\ngenerally, with a solemn blessing upon the President of the United\r\nStates, the territorial governor, and all such as be in authority over\r\nus, and, with an amen which was loudly re-echoed by all around, he\r\nrestored his hat and resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n  [146] Alluding to one Thos. H. Ferguson, a Gentile; he killed, on\r\n  Sept. 17th, 1859, in a drunken moment, A. Carpenter, who kept a\r\n  boot and shoe store. Judge Sinclair, according to the Mormons, was\r\n  exceedingly anxious that somebody should be _sus. per coll._, and,\r\n  although intoxication is usually admitted as a plea in the Western\r\n  States, he ignored it, and hanged the man on Sunday. Mr. Ferguson was\r\n  executed in a place behind the city; he appeared costumed in a Robin\r\n  Hood style, and complained bitterly to the Mormon troops, who were\r\n  drawn out, that his request to be shot had not been granted.\r\n\r\nHaving heard much of the practical good sense which characterizes the\r\nProphet’s discourse, I was somewhat disappointed: probably the occasion\r\nhad not been propitious. As regards the concluding benedictions, they\r\nare profanely compared by the Gentiles to those of the slave, who,\r\nwhile being branded on the hand, was ordered to say thrice, “God\r\nbless the State.” The first was a blessing. So was the second. But at\r\nthe third, natural indignation having mastered Sambo’s philosophy,\r\nforth came a certain naughty word not softened to “darn.” During the\r\ndiscourse, a Saint, in whose family some accident had occurred, was\r\ncalled out, but the accident failed to affect the riveted attention of\r\nthe audience.\r\n\r\nThen arose Mr. Heber C. Kimball, the second President. He is the model\r\nof a Methodist, a tall and powerful man, a “gentleman in black,” with\r\nsmall, dark, piercing eyes, and clean-shaven blue face. He affects the\r\nBoanerges style, and does not at times disdain the part of Thersites:\r\nfrom a certain dislike to the Nonconformist rant and whine, he prefers\r\nan every-day manner of speech, which savors rather of familiarity than\r\nof reverence. The people look more amused when he speaks than when\r\nothers harangue them, and they laugh readily, as almost all crowds\r\nwill, at the thinnest phantom of a joke. Mr. Kimball’s movements\r\ncontrasted strongly with those of his predecessor; they consisted now\r\nof a stone-throwing gesture delivered on tiptoe, then of a descending\r\nmovement, as\r\n\r\n    “When pulpit, drum ecclesiastic,\r\n    Was beat with fist and not with stick.”\r\n\r\nHe began with generalisms about humility, faithfulness, obeying\r\ncounsel, and not beggaring one’s neighbor. Addressing the hand-cart\r\nemigrants, newly arrived from the “sectarian world,” he warned them to\r\nbe on the look-out, or that every soul of them would be taken in and\r\nshaved (a laugh). Agreeing with the Prophet--Mr. Kimball is said to be\r\nhis echo--in a promiscuous way concerning the morality of the Saints,\r\nhe felt it notwithstanding his duty to say that among them were “some\r\nof the greatest rascals in the world” (a louder laugh, and N.B., the\r\nMormons are never spared by their own preachers). After a long suit of\r\nadvice, _à propos de rien_, to missionaries, he blessed, amen’d, and\r\nsat down.\r\n\r\n[MR. KIMBALL’S STYLE.]\r\n\r\nI confess that the second President’s style startled me. But presently\r\nI called to mind Luther’s description[147] of Tetzel’s sermon, in which\r\nhe used to shout the words Bring! bring! bring! with such a horrible\r\nbellowing, that one would have said it was a mad bull rushing on the\r\npeople and goring them with his horns; and D’Aubigné’s neat apology\r\nfor Luther,[148] who, “in one of those homely and quaint, yet not\r\nundignified similitudes which he was fond of using, that he might be\r\nunderstood by the people,” illustrated the idea of God in history by\r\na game of cards! “... Then came our Lord God. He dealt the cards:...\r\nThis is the Ace of God....” Mormons also think it a merit to speak\r\nopenly of “those things we know naturally:” they affect what to others\r\nappears coarseness and indelicacy. The same is the case with Oriental\r\nnations, even among the most modest and moral. After all, taste is in\r\nits general development a mere affair of time and place; what is apt\r\nto _froisser_ us in the nineteenth may have been highly refined in the\r\nsixteenth century, and what may be exceedingly unfit for Westminster\r\nAbbey and Notre Dame is often perfectly suited to the predilections\r\nand intelligence of Wales or the Tessin. It is only fair to both\r\nsides to state that Mr. Kimball is accused by Gentiles of calling\r\nhis young wives, from the pulpit, “little heifers;” of entering into\r\nphysiological details belonging to the Dorcas Society, or the clinical\r\nlecture-room, rather than the house of worship; and of transgressing\r\nthe bounds of all decorum when reproving the sex for its _penchants_\r\nand _ridicules_. At the same time, I never heard, nor heard of, any\r\nsuch indelicacy during my stay at Great Salt Lake City. The Saints\r\nabjured all knowledge of the “fact,” and--in this case, _nefas ab hoste\r\ndoceri_--so gross a scandal should not be adopted from Gentile mouths.\r\n\r\n  [147] History of the Reformation of the Sixteenth Century. Book iii.,\r\n  chap. i.\r\n\r\n  [148] Ditto, Preface.\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Kimball’s address, a list of names for whom letters were\r\nlying unclaimed was called from the platform. Mr. Eldridge, a\r\nmissionary lately returned from foreign travel, adjourned the meeting\r\ntill 2 P.M., delivered the prayer of dismissal, during which all\r\nstood up, and ended with the benediction and amen. The Sacrament was\r\nnot administered on this occasion. It is often given, and reduced to\r\nthe very elements of a ceremony; even water is used instead of wine,\r\nbecause the latter is of Gentile manufacture. Two elders walk up and\r\ndown the rows, one carrying a pitcher, the other a plate of broken\r\nbread, and each Saint partakes of both.\r\n\r\nDirectly the ceremony was over, I passed through the thirty carriages\r\nand wagons that awaited at the door the issuing of the congregation,\r\nand returned home to write my notes. Before appearing in the “Deserét\r\nNews” the discourses are always recomposed; the reader, therefore, is\r\nwarned against the following report, which appeared in the “News” of\r\nWednesday, the 5th of September.\r\n\r\n  “BOWERY.--_Sunday, Sept. 2_, 10 A.M., Bishop Abraham O. Smoot\r\n  addressed the congregation. He said he rejoiced in the opportunity\r\n  he had been favored with of testing both principles and men in the\r\n  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints; he was fully satisfied\r\n  that those who do right are constantly filled with joy and gladness\r\n  by the influence of the Holy Ghost. Every man must know God for\r\n  himself, and practice the principles of righteousness for himself;\r\n  learn the truth and the light, and walk therein. Men are too much in\r\n  the habit of patterning after their neighbors’ actions instead of\r\n  following the dictates of the Spirit of God; if the Saints do right\r\n  they are filled with light, truth, and the power of God. It has been\r\n  a matter of astonishment to many how we could so much rejoice in the\r\n  things of God, but the reason is our religion is true, and we know\r\n  it, for God has revealed it unto us, and hence we can rejoice in\r\n  the midst of calamities that would make our enemies very cross, and\r\n  cause them to swear about their troubles. Nine tenths of those who\r\n  have apostatized have done it on account of prosperity, like Israel\r\n  of old, but the Lord desires to use us for the advancement of his\r\n  kingdom, and the spreading abroad of light and truth. We should live\r\n  for God, and prepare ourselves for all the temporal and spiritual\r\n  blessings of his kingdom.\r\n\r\n  “President Brigham Young said if our heavenly Father could reveal all\r\n  he wishes to his Saints, it would greatly hasten their perfection,\r\n  and asked the question, Are the people prepared to receive those\r\n  communications and profit by them, that would bring about their\r\n  speedy perfection? He discovered a very great variety of degrees of\r\n  intelligence in the people; he also observed a manifest stupidity\r\n  in the people attempting to learn the principles of natural life.\r\n  Observed that God is just and equal in his ways, and that no man will\r\n  dare to dispute; also that there is no man in our government who\r\n  will speak truthfully, and according to his honest convictions, but\r\n  who will admit that we are the most law-abiding people within its\r\n  jurisdiction. Remarked that all the heathen nations have devotional\r\n  instincts, and none more than the natives of this vast continent;\r\n  and they all worship according to the best of their knowledge. The\r\n  whole human family can be saved in the kingdom of God if they are\r\n  disposed to receive and obey the Gospel. Reasoned on the subject of\r\n  fore-ordination, and said the religion of Jesus Christ is designed to\r\n  make the bad good and the good better. Argued that there is a feeling\r\n  in every human breast to acknowledge the supremacy of the Almighty\r\n  Creator. God is just, he is true, and if this were not the case no\r\n  mortal could be exalted in his presence; advised all to improve\r\n  upon the knowledge they had received of the things of God. Referred\r\n  briefly to the birth of Christ, and the attendant opposition and\r\n  threatening of the governments of the nations of the earth.\r\n\r\n  “President Heber C. Kimball followed with appropriate remarks on the\r\n  practical duties of life, the necessity of humility and faithfulness\r\n  among the Saints, and admonished all to be obedient to the mandates\r\n  of heaven, and to the counsels of the living oracles. In giving\r\n  advice to the elders who are expected to go on missions to preach the\r\n  Gospel, he said: ‘The commandment of Jesus to his apostles anciently\r\n  has been renewed unto us, viz., Go ye therefore, and teach all\r\n  nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son,\r\n  and of the Holy Ghost; teaching them to observe all things whatsoever\r\n  I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even unto the end\r\n  of the world.’”\r\n\r\n[MR. BRIGHAM YOUNG’S SERMON.]\r\n\r\nThe student of the subject may desire to see how one of these sermons\r\nreads; I therefore extract from the “Deserét News” one spoken by Mr.\r\nBrigham Young during my stay in the city; it is chosen impartially,\r\nneither because it is better nor because it is worse than its fellows.\r\nThe subject, it will be observed, is uninteresting; in fact, what\r\nnegroes call “talkee-talkee”--_pour passer le temps_. But Mr. Brigham\r\nYoung can, all admit, when occasion serves ability, “bring the house\r\ndown,” and elicit thundering amens.\r\n\r\n  REMARKS by President BRIGHAM YOUNG, _Bowery_, A.M., _August 12,\r\n  1860_. (_Reported by G. D. Watt._)--“I fully understand that all\r\n  Saints constantly, so to speak, pray for each other. And when I find\r\n  a person who does not pray for the welfare of the kingdom of God on\r\n  the earth, and for the honest in heart, I am skeptical in regard\r\n  to believing that person’s religion to be genuine, and his faith\r\n  I should consider not the faith of Jesus. Those who have the mind\r\n  of Christ are anxious that it should spread extensively among the\r\n  people, to bring them to a correct understanding of things as they\r\n  are, that they may be able to prepare themselves to dwell eternally\r\n  in the heavens. This is your desire, and is what we continually pray\r\n  for.\r\n\r\n  “Brother J. V. Long’s discourse this morning was sweet to my taste;\r\n  and the remarks of Brother T. B. H. Stenhouse were very congenial\r\n  to my feelings and understanding. Brother Long has good command of\r\n  language, and can readily choose such words as best suit him to\r\n  convey his ideas.\r\n\r\n  “Brother Stenhouse remarked that the Gospel of salvation is the great\r\n  foundation of this kingdom; that we have not built up this kingdom,\r\n  nor established this organization, we have merely embraced it in\r\n  our faith; that God has established this kingdom, and has bestowed\r\n  the priesthood upon the children of men, and has called upon the\r\n  inhabitants of the earth to receive it, to repent of their sins, and\r\n  return to him with all their hearts. This portion of his remarks I\r\n  wish you particularly to treasure up.\r\n\r\n  “If the Angel Gabriel were to descend and stand before you, though\r\n  he said not a word, the influence and power that would proceed from\r\n  him, were he to look upon you in the power he possesses, would melt\r\n  this congregation. His eyes would be like flaming fire, and his\r\n  countenance would be like the sun at midday. The countenance of an\r\n  holy angel would tell more than all the language in the world. If\r\n  men who are called to speak before a congregation rise full of the\r\n  Holy Spirit and power of God, their countenances are sermons to the\r\n  people. But if their affections, feelings, and desires are like the\r\n  fool’s eye to the ends of the earth, looking for this, that, and the\r\n  other, and the kingdom of God is far from them and not in all their\r\n  affections, they may rise here and talk what they please, and it is\r\n  but like sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal--mere empty, unmeaning\r\n  sounds to the ears of the people. I can not say this of what I have\r\n  heard to-day.\r\n\r\n  “Those faithful elders who have testified of this work to thousands\r\n  of people on the continents and islands of the sea will see the\r\n  fruits of their labors, whether they have said five words or\r\n  thousands. They may not see these fruits immediately, and perhaps in\r\n  many cases not until the millennium, but the savor of their testimony\r\n  will pass down from father to son. Children will say, ‘The words of\r\n  life were spoken to my grandfather and grandmother; they told me of\r\n  them, and I wish to become a member of the Church; I also wish to\r\n  be baptized for my father, and mother, and grandparents;’ and they\r\n  will come and keep coming, the living and the dead, and you will be\r\n  satisfied with your labors, whether they have been much or little, if\r\n  you continue faithful.\r\n\r\n  “Brother Long remarked that before he gathered to Zion he had imbibed\r\n  an idea that the people were all pure here. This is a day of trial\r\n  for you. If there is any thing that should give us sorrow and pain,\r\n  it is that any of the brethren and sisters come here and neglect\r\n  to live their religion. Some are greedy, covetous, and selfish,\r\n  and give way to temptation; they are wicked and dishonest in their\r\n  dealings with one another, and look at and magnify the faults of\r\n  every body, on the right and on the left. ‘Such a sister is guilty of\r\n  pilfering; such a brother is guilty of swearing,’ etc., ‘and we have\r\n  come a long distance to be joined with such a set; we do not care a\r\n  dime for “Mormonism,” nor for any thing else.’ The enemy takes the\r\n  advantage of such persons, and leads them to do that for which they\r\n  are afterward sorry. This is a matter of great regret to those who\r\n  wish to be faithful. But no matter how many give themselves up to\r\n  merchandising and love it better than their God, how many go to the\r\n  gold mines, how many go back on the road to trade with the wicked,\r\n  nor how many take their neighbors’ wood after it is cut and piled up\r\n  in the kanyons, or steal their neighbors’ axes, or any thing that is\r\n  their neighbors’, you live your religion, and we shall see the day\r\n  when we shall tread iniquity under foot. But if you listen to those\r\n  who practice iniquity, you will be carried away by it, as it has\r\n  carried away thousands. Let every one get a knowledge for himself\r\n  that this work is true. We do not want you to say that it is true\r\n  until you know that it is; and if you know it, that knowledge is as\r\n  good to you as though the Lord came down and told you. Then let every\r\n  person say, ‘I will live my religion, though every other person goes\r\n  to hell; I will walk humbly before God, and deal honestly with my\r\n  fellow-beings.’ There are now scores of thousands in this Territory\r\n  who will do this, and who feel as I do on this subject, and we will\r\n  overcome the wicked. Ten filthy, dirty sheep in a thousand cause\r\n  the whole flock to appear defiled, and a stranger would pronounce\r\n  them all filthy; but wash them, and you will find nine hundred and\r\n  ninety pure and clean. It is so with this people; half a dozen\r\n  horse-thieves tend to cause the whole community to appear corrupt in\r\n  the eyes of a casual observer.\r\n\r\n  “Brother Long said that the Lord will deal out correction to the\r\n  evil-doer, but that he would have nothing to do with it. I do not\r\n  know whether I shall or not, but I shall not ask the Lord to do what\r\n  I am not willing to do; and I do not think that Brother Long is any\r\n  more or less ready to do so than I am. Ask any earthly king to do a\r\n  work that you would not do, and he would be insulted. Were I to ask\r\n  the Lord to free us from ungodly wretches, and not lend my influence\r\n  and assistance, he would look upon me differently to what he now does.\r\n\r\n  “You have read that I had an agent in China to mix poison with the\r\n  tea to kill all the nations; that I was at the head of the Vigilance\r\n  Committee in California; that I managed the troubles in Kansas,\r\n  from the beginning to the end; that there is not a liquor-shop\r\n  or distillery but what Brigham Young dictates it: so state the\r\n  newspapers. In these and all other accusations of evil-doing I defy\r\n  them to produce the first show of evidence against me. It is also\r\n  asserted that President Buchanan and myself concocted the plan for\r\n  the army to come here, with a view to make money. By-and-by the poor\r\n  wretches will come bending and say, ‘I wish I was a “Mormon.”’ All\r\n  the army, with its teamsters, hangers-on, and followers, with the\r\n  judges, and nearly all the rest of the civil officers, amounting\r\n  to some seventeen thousand men, have been searching diligently for\r\n  three years to bring one act to light that would criminate me; but\r\n  they have not been able to trace out one thread or one particle of\r\n  evidence that would criminate me; do you know why? Because I walk\r\n  humbly with my God, and do right so far as I know how. I do no evil\r\n  to any one; and as long as I can have faith in the name of the\r\n  Lord Jesus Christ to hinder the wolves from tearing the sheep and\r\n  devouring them, without putting forth my hand, I shall do so.\r\n\r\n  “I can say honestly and truly before God, and the holy angels and\r\n  all men, that not one act of murder or disorder has occurred in this\r\n  city or Territory that I had any knowledge of, any more than a babe\r\n  a week old, until after the event has transpired; that is the reason\r\n  they can not trace any crime to me. If I have faith enough to cause\r\n  the devils to eat up the devils, like the Kilkenny cats, I shall\r\n  certainly exercise it. Joseph Smith said that they would eat each\r\n  other up as did those cats. They will do so here, and throughout the\r\n  world. The nations will consume each other, and the Lord will suffer\r\n  them to bring it about. It does not require much talent or tact to\r\n  get up opposition in these days; you see it rife in communities, in\r\n  meetings, in neighborhoods, and in cities; that is the knife that\r\n  will cut down this government. The axe is laid at the root of the\r\n  tree, and every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit will be hewn\r\n  down.\r\n\r\n  “Out of this Church will grow the kingdom which Daniel saw. This\r\n  is the very people that Daniel saw would continue to grow, and\r\n  spread, and prosper; and if we are not faithful, others will take\r\n  our places, for this is the Church and people that will possess the\r\n  kingdom forever and ever. Will we do this in our present condition\r\n  as a people? No; for we must be pure and holy, and be prepared for\r\n  the presence of our Savior and God, in order to possess the kingdom.\r\n  Selfishness, wickedness, bickering, tattling, lying, and dishonesty\r\n  must depart from the people before they are prepared for the Savior;\r\n  we must sanctify ourselves before our God.\r\n\r\n  “I wanted to ask Brother Long a question this morning--what he had\r\n  learned in regard to the original sin. Let the elders, who like\r\n  speculation, find out what it is, if they can, and inform us next\r\n  Sabbath; or, if you have any thing else that is good, bring it along.\r\n  I wish to impress upon your minds to live your religion, and, when\r\n  you come to this stand to speak, not to care whether you say five\r\n  words or five thousand, but to come with the power of God upon you,\r\n  and you will comfort the hearts of the Saints. All the sophistry in\r\n  the world will do no good. If you live your religion, you will live\r\n  with the Spirit of Zion within you, and will try, by every lawful\r\n  means, to induce your neighbors to live their religion. In this way\r\n  we will redeem Zion, and cleanse it from sin.\r\n\r\n  “God bless you. Amen.”\r\n\r\nThe gift of unknown tongues--which is made by some physiologists the\r\nresult of an affection of the epigastric region, and by others an\r\nabnormal action of the organ of language--is now apparently rarer than\r\nbefore. Anti-Mormon writers thus imitate the “blatant gibberish” which\r\nthey derive directly from Irvingism: “Eli, ele, elo, ela--come, coma,\r\ncomo--reli, rele, rela, relo--sela, selo, sele, selum--vavo, vava,\r\nvavum--sero, seri, sera, serum.” Lieutenant Gunnison relates[149] a\r\nfacetious story concerning a waggish youth, who, after that a woman\r\nhad sprung up and spoken “in tongues” as follows, “Mela, meli, melee,”\r\nsorely pressed by the “gift of interpretation of tongues,” translated\r\nthe sentence into the vernacular, “My leg, my thigh, my knee.” For\r\nthis he was called before the Council, but he stoutly persisted in his\r\n“interpretation” being “by the Spirit,” and they dismissed him with\r\nadmonition. Gentiles have observed that whatever may be uttered “in\r\ntongues,” it is always translated into very intelligible English.\r\n\r\n  [149] The Mormons. Chap. vi. Social Condition.\r\n\r\nThat evening, when dining out, I took a lesson in Mormon modesty. The\r\nmistress of the house, a Gentile, but not an anti-Mormon, was requested\r\nby a saintly visitor, who was also a widow, to instruct me that on no\r\naccount must I propose to see her home. “Mormon ladies,” said my kind\r\ninformant, “are very strict;” unnecessarily so on this occasion, I\r\ncould not but think. Something similar occurred on another occasion: a\r\nvery old lady, wishing to return home, surreptitiously left the room\r\nand sidled out of the garden gate, and my companion, an officer from\r\nCamp Floyd, at once recognized the object of the retreat. I afterward\r\nlearned at dinner and elsewhere among the Mormons to abjure the Gentile\r\npractice of giving precedence to that sex than which, according to\r\nLatin grammar, the masculine is nobler. The lesson, however, was not\r\nnew; I had been taught the same, in times past, among certain German\r\nmissionaries who assumed precedence over their wives upon a principle\r\nborrowed from St. Paul.\r\n\r\n[MR. STAINES.--ADOPTION.]\r\n\r\nI took the earliest opportunity of visiting, at his invitation, the\r\nProphet’s gardens. The grounds were laid out by Mr. W. C. Staines, now\r\non Church business in London.[150] Mr. Staines arrived at Great Salt\r\nLake City an exceptionally poor emigrant, and is now a rich man, with\r\nhouse and farm, all the proceeds of his own industry. This and many\r\nother instances which I could quote prove that although, as a rule, the\r\nhighest dignitaries are the wealthiest, and although the polygamist\r\ncan not expect to keep a large family and fill at the same time a long\r\npurse, the Gentiles somewhat exaggerate when they represent that Church\r\ndiscipline keeps the lower orders in a state of pauperdom. Mr. Staines\r\nis also the “son of ‘Brigham’ by adoption.” This custom is prevalent\r\namong the Mormons as among the Hindoos, but with this difference, that\r\nwhile the latter use it when childless, the former employ it as the\r\nmeans of increasing their glory in the next world. The relationship is\r\ntruly one of parent and child, by choice, not only by the mere accident\r\nof birth, and the “son,” if necessary, lives with and receives the\r\nnecessaries of life from his “father.” Before entering the garden we\r\nwere joined by Mr. Mercer, who, long after my departure from India, had\r\nmissionarized at Kurrachee in “Scinde, or the Unhappy Valley.”\r\n\r\n  [150] I have to thank Mr. Staines for kind assistance in supplying me\r\n  with necessary items of information.\r\n\r\n[FRUIT.]\r\n\r\nThe May frost had injured the fruit. Grapes were but quarter-grown,\r\nwhile winter was fast approaching. I suggested to the civil and\r\nobliging English gardener that it would be well to garnish the\r\ntrellised walls, as is done in Tuscany, with mats which roll up and can\r\nbe let down at night. Bacchus appeared in three forms: the California\r\ngrape, which is supposed to be the Madeira introduced into the New\r\nWorld by the Franciscan Missions; the Catawba--so called from an Indian\r\npeople on a river of the same name--a cultivated variety of the _Vitis\r\nlabrusca_, and still the wine-grape in the States. The third is the\r\ninferior Isabella, named after his wife by “ole man Gibbs,”[151] who\r\nfirst attempted to civilize the fox-grape (_Vitis vulpina_), growing\r\non banks of streams in most of the temperate states. A vineyard is now\r\nbeing planted on the hill-side near Mr. Brigham Young’s block, and\r\nhome-made wine will soon become an item of produce in Utah. Pomology is\r\ncarefully cultivated; about one hundred varieties of apples have been\r\nimported, and of these ninety-one are found to thrive as seedlings:\r\nin good seasons their branches are bowed down by fruit, and must be\r\npropped up, or they will break under their load. The peaches were in\r\nall cases unpruned: upon this important point opinions are greatly\r\ndivided. The people generally believe that the foliage is a protection\r\nto the fruit during the spring frosts. The horticulturists declare that\r\nthe “extremes of temperature render proper pruning even more necessary\r\nthan in France, and that the fervid summers often induce a growth of\r\nwood which must suffer severely during the inclement months, unless\r\nchecked and hardened by cutting back.” Besides grapes and apples, there\r\nwere walnuts, apricots and quinces, cherries and plums, currants,\r\nraspberries, and gooseberries. The principal vegetables were the Irish\r\nand the sweet potato, squashes, peas--excellent--cabbages, beets,\r\ncauliflowers, lettuce, and broccoli; a little rhubarb is cultivated,\r\nbut it requires too much expensive sugar for general use, and white\r\ncelery has lately been introduced. Leaving the garden, we walked\r\nthrough the various offices, oil-mill, timber-mill, and smithy: in the\r\nlatter oxen are shod, according to the custom of the country, with half\r\nshoes. The animal is raised from the ground by a broad leather band\r\nunder the belly, and is liable to be lamed by any but a practiced hand.\r\n\r\n  [151] Similarly, the Constantia of the Cape was named after Madam Van\r\n  Stell, the wife of the governor.\r\n\r\n[THE PENITENTIARY.]\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 3d of September, while sauntering about the\r\nsquare in which a train of twenty-three wagons had just bivouacked,\r\namong the many others to whom Mr. Staines introduced me was the Apostle\r\nJohn Taylor, the “Champion of Rights,” Speaker in the House, and\r\nwhilom editor. I had heard of him from the best authorities as a man\r\nso morose and averse to Gentiles, “who made the healing virtue depart\r\nout of him,” that it would be advisable to avoid his “fierceness.” The\r\n_véridique_ Mr. Austin Ward describes him as “an old man deformed and\r\ncrippled,” and Mrs. Ferris as a “heavy, dark-colored, beetle-browed\r\nman.” Of course, I could not recognize him from these descriptions--a\r\nstout, good-looking, somewhat elderly personage, with a kindly gray\r\neye, pleasant expression, and a forehead of the superior order; he\r\ntalked of Westmoreland his birthplace, and of his European travels\r\nfor a time, till the subject of Carthage coming upon the _tapis_, I\r\nsuspected who my interlocutor was. Mr. Staines burst out laughing\r\nwhen he heard my mistake, and I explained the reason to the apostle,\r\nwho laughed as heartily. Wishing to see more of him, I accompanied\r\nhim in the carriage to the Sugar-house Ward, where he was bound on\r\nbusiness, and _chemin faisant_ we had a long talk. He pointed out\r\nto me on the left the mouths of the several kanyons, and informed\r\nme that the City Creek and the Red Buttes on the northeast, and\r\nthe Emigration, Parley’s, Mill Creek, Great Cotton-wood and Little\r\nCotton-wood Kanyons to the east and southeast, all head together in\r\ntwo points, thus enabling troops and provisions to be easily and\r\nreadily concentrated for the defense of the eastern approaches. When\r\ntalking about the probability of gold digging being developed near\r\nGreat Salt Lake City, he said that the Mormons are aware of that, but\r\nthat they look upon agriculture as their real wealth. The Gentiles,\r\nhowever--it is curious that they do not form a company among themselves\r\nfor prospecting--assert that the Church has very rich mines, which are\r\nguarded by those dragons of Danites more fiercely than the Hesperidian\r\nGardens, and which will never be known till Miss Utah becomes Mistress\r\nDeserét. Arriving at the tall, gaunt Sugar-house--its occupation is\r\ngone, while the name remains--we examined the machinery employed\r\nin making threshing and wool-carding machines, flanges, wheels,\r\ncranks, and similar necessaries. After a visit to a nail manufactory\r\nbelonging to Squire Wells, and calling upon Mrs. Harris, we entered\r\nthe Penitentiary. It is a somewhat Oriental-looking building, with a\r\nlarge quadrangle behind the house, guarded by a wall with a walk on\r\nthe summit, and pepper-caster sentry-boxes at each angle. There are\r\ncells in which the convicts are shut up at night, but one of these\r\nhad lately been broken by an Indian, who had cut his way through the\r\nwall; a Hindoo “gonnoff” would soon “pike” out of a “premonitory” like\r\nthis. We found in it besides the guardians only six persons, of whom\r\ntwo were Yutas. When I remarked to Gentiles how few were the evidences\r\nof crime, they invariably replied that, instead of half a dozen souls,\r\nhalf the population ought to be in the place. On our return we resumed\r\nthe subject of the massacre at Carthage, in which it will be remembered\r\nthat Mr. John Taylor was severely wounded, and escaped by a miracle,\r\nas it were. I told him openly that there must have been some cause for\r\nthe furious proceedings of the people in Illinois, Missouri, and other\r\nplaces against the Latter-Day Saints; that even those who had extended\r\nhospitality to them ended by hating and expelling them, and accusing\r\nthem of all possible iniquities, especially of horse-thieving, forgery,\r\nlarceny, and offenses against property, which on the borders are never\r\npardoned--was this smoke quite without fire? He heard me courteously\r\nand in perfect temper; replied that no one claimed immaculateness\r\nfor the Mormons; that the net cast into the sea brought forth evil\r\nas well as good fish, and that the Prophet was one of the laborers\r\nsent into the vineyard at the eleventh hour. At the same time, that\r\nwhen the New Faith was stoutly struggling into existence, it was the\r\nobject of detraction, odium, persecution--so, said Mr. Taylor, were\r\nthe Christians in the days of Nero--that the border ruffians, forgers,\r\nhorse-thieves, and other vile fellows followed the Mormons wherever\r\nthey went; and, finally, that every fraud and crime was charged upon\r\nthose whom the populace were disposed, by desire for confiscation’s\r\nsake, to believe guilty. Besides the theologic odium there was also\r\nthe political: the Saints would vote for their favorite candidates,\r\nconsequently they were never without enemies. He quoted the Mormon\r\nrules: 1. Worship what you like. 2. Leave your neighbor alone. 3.\r\nVote for whom you please; and compared their troubles to the Western,\r\nor, as it is popularly called, the Whisky insurrection in 1794, whose\r\n“dreadful night” is still remembered in Pennsylvania. Mr. Taylor\r\nremarked that the Saints had been treated by the United States as the\r\ncolonies had been treated by the crown: that the persecuted naturally\r\nbecame persecutors, as the Pilgrim fathers, after flying for their\r\nfaith, hung the Quakers on Bloody Hill at Boston; and that even the\r\nGentiles can not defend their own actions. I heard for the first time\r\nthis view of the question, and subsequently obtained from the apostle\r\na manuscript account, written _in extenso_, of his experience and\r\nhis sufferings. It has been transferred in its integrity to Appendix\r\nNo. III., the length forbidding its insertion in the text: a tone of\r\ncandor, simplicity, and honesty renders it highly attractive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANCIENT LAKE BENCH-LAND.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nDescriptive Geography, Ethnology, and Statistics of Utah Territory.\r\n\r\n\r\nUtah Territory, so called from its Indian owners, the Yuta--“those that\r\ndwell in mountains”--is still, to a certain extent, _terra incognita_,\r\nnot having yet been thoroughly explored, much less surveyed or settled.\r\n\r\nThe whole Utah country has been acquired, like Oregon, by conquest\r\nand diplomacy. By the partition of 1848, the parallel of N. lat.\r\n42°, left unsettled, between the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific, by\r\nthe treaties of the 22d of October, 1818, and the 12th of February,\r\n1819, was prolonged northward to N. lat. 49°, thus adding to the\r\nUnited States California, Oregon, and Washington, while to Britain\r\nremained Vancouver’s Island and the joint navigation of the Columbia\r\nRiver. Under the Hispano-Americans the actual Utah Territory formed\r\nthe northern portion of Alta California, and the peace of Guadalupe\r\nHidalgo, concluded in 1848 between the United States and Mexico,\r\ntransferred it from the latter to the former.\r\n\r\n[GEOGRAPHY OF UTAH TERRITORY.]\r\n\r\nThe present boundaries of Utah Territory are, northward (42° N. lat.),\r\nthe State of Oregon; and southward, a line pursuing the parallel\r\nof N. lat. 37°, separating it from New Mexico to the southeast and\r\nfrom California to the southwest. The eastern portion is included\r\nbetween 106° and 120° W. long. (G.); a line following the crest of\r\nthe Green River, the Wasach, the Bear River, and other sections of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains, whose southern extremities anastomose to form\r\nthe Sierra Nevada, separate it from Nebraska and Kansas. On the west\r\nit is bounded, between 116° and 120° W. long., by the lofty crest of\r\nthe Sierra Nevada; the organization, however, of a new territory, the\r\n“Nevada,” on the landward slope of the Snowy Range, has diminished its\r\ndimensions by about half. Utah had thus 5° of extreme breadth, and 14°\r\nof total length; it was usually reckoned 650 miles long from east to\r\nwest, and 350 broad from north to south. The shape was an irregular\r\nparallelogram, of which the area was made to vary from 188,000 to\r\n225,000 square miles, almost the superficies of France.\r\n\r\nThe surface configuration of Utah Territory is like Central Equatorial\r\nAfrica, a great depression in a mountain land: a trough elevated 4000\r\nto 5000 feet above sea level, subtended on all sides by mountains 8000\r\nto 10,000 feet high, and subdivided by transverse ridges. The “Rim\r\nof the Basin” is an uncontinuous line formed by the broken chains of\r\nOregon to the north, and to the south by the little-known sub-ranges\r\nof the Rocky Mountains; the latter also form the eastern wall, while\r\nthe Sierra Nevada hems in the west. Before the present upheaval of\r\nthe country the Great Interior Basin was evidently a sweetwater\r\ninland sea; the bench formation, a system of water-marks, is found\r\nin every valley, while detached and parallel blocks of mountain,\r\ntrending almost invariably north and south, were in geological ages\r\nrock-islands protruding from the lake surface like those that now\r\nbreak the continuity of that “vast and silent sea” the Great Salt\r\nLake. Between these primitive and metamorphic ridges lie the secondary\r\nbasins, whose average width may be 15-20 miles; they open into one\r\nanother by kanyons and passes, and are often separated longitudinally,\r\nlike “waffle-irons,” by smaller divides running east and west, thus\r\nconverting one extended strip of secondary into a system of tertiary\r\nvalleys. The Great Basin, which is not less than 500 miles long by 500\r\nbroad, is divided by two large chains, which run transversely from\r\nnortheast to southwest. The northernmost is the range of the Humboldt\r\nRiver, rising 5000-6000 feet above the sea. The southern is the\r\nprolongation of the Wasach, whose southwestern extremity abuts upon the\r\nPacific coast range; it attains a maximum elevation of nearly 12,000\r\nfeet. Without these mountains, whose gorges are fed during the spring,\r\nand even in the summer, by melted snow, there would be no water. The\r\nlevels of the valleys are still unknown; it is yet a question how far\r\nthey are irregular in elevation, whether they have formed detached\r\nlakes, or whether they slope uniformly and by steps toward the Great\r\nSalt Lake and the other reservoirs scattered at intervals over the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe water-shed of the Basin is toward the north, south, east, and west:\r\nthe affluents of the Columbia and the Colorado rivers carry off the\r\ngreatest amount of drainage. One of the geographical peculiarities\r\nof the Territory is the “sinking,” as it is technically called, of\r\nthe rivers. The phenomenon is occasioned by the porous nature of the\r\nsoil. The larger streams, like the Humboldt and the Carson rivers,\r\nform terminating lakes. The smaller are either absorbed by sand, or\r\nsink, like the South African fountains, in ponds and puddles of black\r\nmire, beneath which is peaty earth that burns as if by spontaneous\r\ncombustion, and smoulders for a long time in dry weather: the waters\r\neither reappear, or, escaping under the surface--a notable instance of\r\nthe “subterranean river”--feed the greater drains and the lakes. The\r\npotamology is more curious than useful; the streams, being unnavigable,\r\nplay no important part in the scheme of economy.\r\n\r\nUtah Territory is well provided with lakes; of these are two nearly\r\nparallel chains extending across the country. The easternmost begins\r\nat the north, with the Great Salt Lake, the small tarns of the Wasach,\r\nthe Utah, or Sweetwater Reservoir, the Nicollet, and the Little Salt\r\nLake, complete the line which is fed by the streams that flow from the\r\nwestern counterslope of the Wasach. The other chain is the drainage\r\ncollected from the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada; it consists of\r\nMud, Pyramid, Carson, Mono, and Walker’s lakes. Of these, Pyramid Lake,\r\nso called by Colonel Frémont, its explorer, from a singular rock in the\r\ncentre, is the most beautiful--a transparent water, 700 feet above the\r\nlevel of the Great Salt Lake, and walled in by precipices nearly 3000\r\nfeet high.\r\n\r\nThe principal thermal features of Utah Territory are the Bear Springs,\r\nnear the Fort Hall Road. The Harrowgate Springs, near Great Salt Lake\r\nCity, have already been alluded to. Between the city and Bear River\r\nthere is a fountain of strong brine, described as discharging a large\r\nvolume of water. There are sulphurous pools at the southern extremity\r\nof the Great Salt Lake Valley. Others are chalybeate, coating the earth\r\nand the rocks with oxide of iron. Almost every valley has some thermal\r\nspring, in which various confervæ flourish; the difficulty is to find\r\ngood cold water.\r\n\r\nAnother curious geographical peculiarity of the Territory is the\r\nformation of the mountains. For the most part the ridges, instead of\r\npresenting regular slopes, more or less inclined, are formed of short\r\nbut acute angular cappings superimposed upon flatter prisms. It often\r\nhappens that after easily ascending two thirds from the base, the upper\r\npart suddenly becomes wall-like and insurmountable.\r\n\r\n[CLIMATE OF UTAH TERRITORY.]\r\n\r\nUtah Territory is situated in the parallel of the Mediterranean; the\r\nsouthern boundary corresponds with the provinces along the Amoor lately\r\nacquired by Russia, and with Tasmania in the southern hemisphere. But\r\nthe elevation, that grand modifier of climate, renders it bleak and\r\nliable to great vicissitudes of temperature. The lowest valley rises\r\n4000 feet above sea level; the mountains behind Great Salt Lake City\r\nare 6000 feet high; Mount Nebo is marked 8000, and the Twin Peaks,\r\nthat look upon the “Happy Valley,” were ascertained barometrically\r\nby Messrs. O. Pratt and A. Carrington to be 11,660 feet in height:\r\nin the western part of the Territory the Sierra Nevada averages 2000\r\nfeet above the South Pass, and it has peaks that tower thousands of\r\nfeet above that altitude. These snowy masses, in whose valleys thaw is\r\nseldom known, exercise a material effect upon the climate, and cause\r\nthe cultivator to wage fierce war with the soil. The air is highly\r\nrarefied by its altitude. Captain Stansbury’s barometrical observations\r\nfor May, June, July, and August, give as a maximum 27·80 at 9 A.M.\r\non the 4th of August, and minimum 22·86 at sunrise on the 19th of\r\nJune, with a general range between 25° and 26°. New-comers suffer\r\nfrom difficulty of breathing; often after sudden and severe exercise,\r\nclimbing, or running, the effect is like the nausea, sickness, and\r\nfainting experienced upon Mont Blanc and in Tibet; even horses feel it,\r\nand must pass two or three months before they are acclimatized.[152]\r\n\r\n  [152] Subjoined is an abstract of meteorology kindly forwarded to me\r\n  by Judge Phelps:\r\n\r\n  “Great Salt Lake City, Utah, Oct. 24th, 1860.\r\n\r\n  “DEAR SIR,--The following is an abstract of meteorological\r\n  observations for the past year, from October, 1859, to October, 1860,\r\n  inclusive:\r\n\r\n  Yearly mean of barometer      25·855\r\n  Highest range                 26·550\r\n  Lowest range                  25·205\r\n  Thermometer attached (mean)      60°\r\n  Thermometer (open air)  „        71°\r\n  Thermometer, dry bulb   „        64°\r\n  Thermometer, wet bulb   „        58°\r\n  (All Fahrenheit.)\r\n\r\n  “The amount of fair days, 244. The remaining 121 were 31 stormy and\r\n  the residue cloudy and foggy.\r\n\r\n  “The course of the wind more than two thirds of the year goes round\r\n  daily with the sun; strongest wind south; worst for stock, north.\r\n\r\n  “Highest range of the thermometer, 96° in July; lowest range in\r\n  December--22° below 0.\r\n\r\n  “The amount of snow and rainwater was 12·257, which is somewhat over\r\n  1 foot.\r\n\r\n  “All the snow in the Valley was less than 3 feet, while perhaps in\r\n  the mountains it was more than 10 feet, which gives ample water for\r\n  irrigation.\r\n\r\n  “The weather during the year was steady, without extremes.\r\n\r\n  “Such was Utah in 1860.\r\n\r\n  “Respectfully, I have the honor to be, etc.,\r\n\r\n  W. W. PHELPS.”\r\n\r\nThe climate of the Basin has been compared with that of the Tartar\r\nplains of High Asia. Spring opens in the valleys with great suddenness;\r\nall is bloom and beauty below, while the snow-line creeps lingeringly\r\nup the mountain side, and does not disappear till the middle of June.\r\nThus there are but three months of warmth in the high lands; the\r\nlow lands have four, beginning with a May-day like that of England.\r\nAt the equinoxes, both vernal and autumnal, there are rains in the\r\nbottoms, which in the upper levels become sleet or snow. Between April\r\nand October showers are rare; there are, however, exceptions, heavy\r\ndownfalls, with thunder, lightning, and hail. “Clouds without water”\r\nis a proverbial expression; a dark, heavy pall, which in woodland\r\ncountries would burst with its weight, here sails over the arid,\r\nsun-parched surface, and discharges its watery stores in the kanyons\r\nand upon the mountains. During the first few years after the arrival\r\nof the Saints there was little rain either in spring or autumn; in\r\n1860 it extended to the middle of June. The change may be attributed\r\nto cultivation and plantation; thus also may be explained the North\r\nAmerican Indian’s saying that the pale-face brings with him his rain.\r\nThe same has been observed in Kansas and New Mexico, and is equally\r\nremarked by the natives of Cairo, the Aden Coal-hole, and Kurrachee.\r\nSeed-time lasts from April to the 10th of June.\r\n\r\nThe summer is hot, but the lightness and the aridity of the air prevent\r\nits being unwholesome. During my visit the thermometer (F.) placed\r\nin a room with open windows showed at dawn 63-66°; at noon, 75°; and\r\nat sunset, 70°: the greatest midday heat was 105°. The mornings and\r\nevenings, cooled by breezes from the mountains, were deliciously soft\r\nand pure. The abundant electricity was proved, as in Sindh and Arabia,\r\nby frequent devils or dust-pillars, like huge columns of volcanic\r\nsmoke, that careered over the miraged plains, violently excited where\r\nthey touched the negative earth, and calm in the positive strata of\r\nthe upper air, whence their floating particles were precipitated.\r\nDust-storms and thunder-storms are frequent and severe. Clouds often\r\ngather upon the peaks, and a heavy black nimbus rises behind the Wasach\r\nwall, setting off its brilliant sunlit side, but there is seldom rain.\r\nShowers are preceded, as in Eastern Africa, by puffs and gusts of cold\r\nair, and are expected in Great Salt Lake City when the clouds come from\r\nthe west and southwest, opposite and over the “Black Rock;” otherwise\r\nthey will cling to the hills. Even in the hottest weather, a cold\r\ncontinuous wind, as from the nozzle of a forge-bellows, pours down the\r\ndeep damp kanyons, where the snow lingers, and travelers, especially\r\nat night, prepare to pass across the ravine mouths with blankets and\r\nwarm clothing. Where the federal troops encamped on the stony bench\r\nopposite the Provo Kanyon, it was truly predicted that they would\r\nsoon be blown out. When summer is protracted, severe droughts are the\r\nresult. Harvest-time is in the beginning of July.\r\n\r\nAbout early September the heat ends. In 1860, the first snow fell upon\r\nthe Twin Peaks and their neighborhood on the 12th of September. Rains\r\nthen usually set in for a fortnight or three weeks, and mild weather\r\noften lasts till the end of October. November is partially a fine\r\nmonth; after two or three snowy days, the Indian summer ushers in the\r\nmost enjoyable weather of the year, which, when short, ends about the\r\nmiddle of November.\r\n\r\nWinter has three very severe months, reckoned from December. Icy winds\r\nblow hard, and gales are sometimes so high that spray is carried from\r\nthe Great Salt Lake to the City, a distance of 10-12 miles. In 1854-5\r\nhundreds of cattle perished in the snow. Usually in mid-winter, snow\r\nfalls every day with a high westerly wind, veering toward the north,\r\nand thick with poudré--dry icy spiculæ, hard as gravel. The thermometer\r\nis not often below zero in the bottoms; on the 13th of December, 1859,\r\nhowever, the thermometer at daylight, with the barometer at 26·250,\r\nshowed -22° (F.); 5° or 6° lower than it had ever been before. The snow\r\nseldom lies in the valleys deeper than a man’s knee; it is dry, and\r\nreadily thawed by the sun. A vast quantity is drifted into the kanyons\r\nand passes, where the people, as in Styria, often become prisoners at\r\nhome. These crevasses, hundreds of feet deep, retain their icy stores\r\nthroughout the year. It is asserted by those who believe in a Pacific\r\nRailway upon this line[153] that the Wasach can be traversed at all\r\nseasons; at present, however, sledge transit only is practicable, and\r\nat times even that is found impossible.\r\n\r\n  [153] The Pacific Railroad in 1852 was unknown to the political\r\n  world: in 1856 it began to be necessary, and shortly afterward it\r\n  appeared in both “platforms,” because without it no one could expect\r\n  to carry the Mississippian and Pacific States, Texas, for instance,\r\n  and California. The Diary will show the many difficulties which\r\n  it must encounter after crossing the South Pass; as the West can\r\n  afford no assistance, provisions and material must all come from\r\n  the East--an additional element of expense and delay. The estimate\r\n  is roughly laid down at $100,000,000: it may safely be doubled.\r\n  The well-known contractor, Mr. Whitney, offered to build it for a\r\n  reservation of thirty miles on both sides: the idea was rejected\r\n  as that of a crazy man. It is promised in ten years, and will\r\n  probably take thirty. England, then, had better look to _her_ line\r\n  through Canada and Columbia--it would be worth a hundred East Indian\r\n  railroads.\r\n\r\nIt can not be doubted that this climate of arid heat and dry cold is\r\neminently suited to most healthy and to many sickly constitutions:\r\nchildren and adults have come from England apparently in a dying\r\nstate, and have lived to be strong and robust men. I have elsewhere\r\nalluded to the effect of rarefaction upon the English _physique_:\r\nanother has been stated, namely, that the atmosphere is too fine\r\nand dry to require, or even to permit, the free use of spirituous\r\nliquors. Paralysis is rare; scrofula and phthisis are unknown, as\r\nin Nebraska--the climate wants that humidity which brings forward\r\nthe predisposition. It is also remarkable that, though all drink\r\nsnow-water, and though many live in valleys where there is no free\r\ncirculation of air, goître and cretinism are not yet named. The City\r\nCouncil maintains an excellent sanitary supervision, which extends to\r\nthe minutest objects that might endanger the general health. The stream\r\nof emigrants which formerly set copiously westward is now dribbling\r\nback toward its source, and a quarantine is established for those who\r\narrive with contagious diseases. Great Salt Lake City is well provided\r\nwith disciples of Æsculapius, against whom there is none of that\r\nprejudice founded upon superstition and fanaticism which anti-Mormon\r\nwriters have detected. Dr. Francis, an English Mormon, lately died,\r\nleaving Dr. Anderson, a graduate of Maryland College, to take his\r\nplace: Dr. Bernhisel prefers politics to physic, and Dr. Kay is the\r\nchief dentist.\r\n\r\n[DISEASES.]\r\n\r\nThe normal complaints are easily explained by local\r\npeculiarities--cold, alkaline dust, and overindulgence in food.\r\n\r\nNeuralgia is by no means uncommon. Many are compelled to wear kerchiefs\r\nunder their hats; and if a head be not always uncovered, there is some\r\nreason for it. Rheumatism, as in England, affects the poorer classes,\r\nwho are insufficiently fed and clothed. Pneumonia, in winter, follows\r\nexposure and hard work. The pleuro-pneumonia, which in 1860 did so much\r\ndamage to stock in New England, did not extend to Utah Territory: the\r\nclimate, however, is too like that of the Cape of Storms to promise\r\nlasting immunity. Catarrhs are severe and lasting; they are accompanied\r\nby bad toothaches and sore throats, which sometimes degenerate into\r\nbronchitis. Diphtheria is not yet known. The measles have proved\r\nespecially fatal to the Indians: in 1850, “Old Elk,” the principal\r\nwar-chief of the Timpanogos Yutas, died of it: erysipelas also kills\r\nmany of the wild men.\r\n\r\nFor ophthalmic disease, the climate has all the efficients of the\r\nValley of the Nile, and, unless suitable precautions are taken, the\r\nrace will, after a few generations, become tender-eyed as Egyptians.\r\nThe organ is weakened by the acrid irritating dust from the alkaline\r\nsoil, which glistens in the sun like hoar-frost. Snow-blindness is\r\ncommon on the mountains and in the plains: the favorite preventive,\r\nwhen goggles are unprocurable, is to blacken the circumorbital region\r\nand the sides of the nose with soot--the kohl, surmah, or collyrium\r\nof the Far West: the cure is a drop of nitrate of silver or laudanum.\r\nThe mucous membrane in horses, as among men, is glandered, as it were,\r\nby alkali, and the chronic inflammation causes frequent hemorrhage:\r\nthe nitrous salts in earth and air exasperate to ulcers sunburns on\r\nthe nose and mouth: it is not uncommon to see men riding or walking\r\nwith a bit of paper instead of a straw between their lips. Wounds\r\nmust be treated to great disadvantage where the climate, like that of\r\nAbyssinia, renders a mere scratch troublesome. The dryness of the air\r\nproduces immunity from certain troublesome excrescences which cause\r\nshooting pains in humid regions, and the pedestrian requires no vinegar\r\nand water to harden his feet: on the other hand, horses’ hoofs, as in\r\nSindh and Arabia, must be stuffed with tar, to prevent sun-crack.\r\n\r\nUnder the generic popular name “mountain fever” are included various\r\nspecies of febrile affections, intermittent, remittent, and typhoid:\r\nthey are treated successfully with quinine.\r\n\r\nEmigrants are advised to keep up hard work and scanty fare after\r\narrival, otherwise the sudden change from semi-starvation and absence\r\nof fruit and vegetables upon the prairies to plenty in the settlements\r\nmay cause dyspepsia, dysentery, and visceral inflammation. Some are\r\nattacked by “liver complaint,” the trivial term for the effects of\r\nmalaria, which, when inhaled, affects successively the lungs, blood,\r\nliver, and other viscera. The favorite, and, indeed, the only known\r\nsuccessful treatment is by mineral acids, nitric, muriatic, and\r\nothers.[154] Scurvy is unknown to the settlers; when brought in after\r\nlong desert marches, it yields readily to a more generous diet and\r\nvegetables, especially potatoes, which, even in the preserved form, act\r\nas a specific. The terrible scorbutic disease, called the “black canker\r\nof the plains,” has not extended so far west.\r\n\r\n  [154] The following is the favorite cure: it is upon the principle of\r\n  the medicinal bath well known in Europe.\r\n\r\n  ℞ Acid. Nit. ℥i.\r\n    Acid. Mur. ʒii. Mis.\r\n\r\n  Of this fifteen drops are to be taken in a tumbler of water twice a\r\n  day before meals. The local application to the hepatic region is one\r\n  ounce of the nitro-muriatic acid in a quart of water, and applied\r\n  upon a compress every night.\r\n\r\n[ANIMALS OF UTAH TERRITORY.]\r\n\r\nThere is not much sport with fur, feather, and fin in this part of\r\nthe Far West: the principal carnivors of the Great Basin are the\r\ncougar (_F. unicolor_) and the cat-o’-mountain, the large and small\r\nwolf, a variety of foxes, the red (_V. fulvus_), the great-tailed\r\n(_V. macrourus_) and the silver (_V. argentatus_), whose spoils were\r\nonce worth their weight in silver. There are minks, ermines, skunks,\r\nAmerican badgers, and wolverines or gluttons, which ferret out\r\ncaches of peltries and provisions, and are said sometimes to attack\r\nman. Of rodents the principal are the beaver, a burrowing hare, the\r\njackass-rabbit (_L. callotis_), porcupines, the geomys or gophar,\r\na sand-rat peculiar to America, the woodchuck or ground-hog, many\r\nsquirrels, especially the Spermophilus tredecim lineatus, which swarms\r\nin hilly ground, and muskrat (_F. zibeticus_), which, like other\r\nvermin, is eaten by Indians. The principal pachyderm is the hyrax,\r\ncalled by the settlers “cony.” Of the ruminants we find the antelope,\r\ndeer, elk, and the noble bighorn, or Rocky Mountain sheep, the\r\nmoufflon or argali of the New World.\r\n\r\nOf the raptors the principal are the red-tailed hawk (_B. borealis_),\r\nthe sharp-shinned hawk (_A. fuscus_), the sparrow-hawk, and the\r\nvulturine turkey-buzzard. Of game-birds there are several varieties of\r\nquail, called partridges, especially the beautiful blue species (_O.\r\nCalifornica_), and grouse, especially the sage-hen (_T. urophasianus_):\r\nthe water-fowl are swans (_C. Americanus_), wild geese in vast\r\nnumbers, the white pelican, here a migrating bird, the cormorant\r\n(_Phalacrocorax_), the mallard or greenhead (_A. boschas_), which\r\nloves the water of Jordan and the western Sea of Tiberias, the teal,\r\nred-breasted and green-winged, the brant (_A. bernicla_), the plover\r\nand curlew, the gull (a small _Larus_), a blue heron, and a brown\r\ncrane (_G. Canadensis_), which are found in the marshes throughout the\r\nwinter. The other members of the family are the bluebird (_A. sialia_),\r\nthe humming-bird (_Trochilus_), finches, woodpeckers, the swamp\r\nblackbird, and the snowbird, small passerines: there is also a fine\r\nlark (_Sturnella_) with a harsh note, which is considered a delicacy in\r\nautumn.\r\n\r\nBesides a variety of gray and green lizards, the principal Saurian is\r\nthe Phrynosoma, a purely American type, popularly called the horned\r\nfrog--or toad, although its tail, its scaly body, and its inability\r\nto jump disprove its title to rank as a batrachian--and by the\r\nMexicans chameleon, because it is supposed to live on air. It is of\r\nmany species, for which the naturalist is referred to the Appendix of\r\nCaptain Stansbury’s Exploration. The serpents are chiefly rattlesnakes,\r\nswamp-adders, and water-snakes. The fishes are perch, pike, bass,\r\nchub, a mountain trout averaging three pounds, and salmon trout which\r\nhas been known to weigh thirty pounds. There are but few mollusks,\r\nperiwinkles, snails, and fresh-water clams.[155]\r\n\r\n  [155] Mr. W. Baird, in the absence of Mr. S. Woodward, of the British\r\n  Museum, has kindly favored me with the following list of a little\r\n  collection from the Great Basin which I placed in his hands.\r\n\r\n  “British Museum, August 3d, 1861.\r\n\r\n  “DEAR SIR,--The Helix (with open umbilicus) is, I think, _H.\r\n  solitaria_; the large Physa is very near, if not identical with\r\n  the _P. elliptica_ of our collection; the next largest Physa comes\r\n  very near _P. gyrina_; the larger Lymnœa is _L. catascopium_, the\r\n  smaller ditto _L. modicella_. There are two species of the genus\r\n  _Lithoglyphus_, the one resembling very much the _L. naticoides_\r\n  of Europe, but most probably new; the other I should imagine to be\r\n  undescribed. There is a small _Paludina_ looking shell which comes\r\n  very near the _Paludina piscium_ of D’Orbigny. There is a species of\r\n  _Anodonta_ which corresponds with a shell we have from the Columbia\r\n  River, but of which I do not know the name. There is also a species\r\n  of _Cyclas_ which may be new, as I do not know at present any species\r\n  from North America exactly like it. Believe me, yours truly,\r\n\r\n  W. BAIRD.\r\n\r\n  “Capt. R. F. Burton.”\r\n\r\nThe botany of the Great Basin has been investigated by Messrs. Frémont\r\nand Stansbury, who forwarded their collections for description to\r\nProfessor John Torrey, of New York: M. Remy has described his own\r\nherbarium. To these valuable works the reader may be referred for all\r\nnow known upon the subject.\r\n\r\n[GEOLOGY OF UTAH TERRITORY.]\r\n\r\nThe rocks in Utah Territory are mostly primitive--granite, brick-red\r\njasper, syenite, hornblende, and porphyry, with various quartzes,\r\nof which the most curious is a white nodule surrounded by a\r\ncrystalline layer of satin spar. The presence of obsidian, scoriæ, and\r\nlava--apparently a dark brown mud tinged with iron, and so vitrified by\r\nheat that it rings--evidences volcanic action. Many of the ridges are a\r\ncarboniferous limestone threaded by calcareous spar, and in places rich\r\nwith encrinites and fossil corallines; it rests upon or alternates with\r\nhard and compact grits and sandstone. The kanyons in the neighborhood\r\nof Great Salt Lake City supply boulders of serpentine, fine gray\r\ngranite, coarse red ochrish pœcilated crystalline-white and metamorphic\r\nsandstones, a variety of conglomerates, especially granitic, with tufa\r\nin large masses, talcose and striated slates, some good for roofing,\r\ngypsum (plaster of Paris), pebbles of alabaster and various kinds of\r\nlimestones, some dark and fetid, others oolitic, some compact and\r\nmassive, black, blue, or ash-colored, seamed with small veins of white\r\ncarbonate of lime, others light gray and friable, cased with tufa, or\r\nveneered with jade. The bottom-soil in most parts is fitted for the\r\nadobe, and the lower hills contain an abundance of fossilless chalky\r\nlime, which makes tolerable mortar: the best is that near Deep Creek,\r\nthe worst is in the vicinity of Great Salt Lake City. Near Fort Hall,\r\nin the northeast corner of the basin, there is said to be a mountain of\r\nmarble displaying every hue and texture: marble is also found in large\r\ncrystalline nodules like arragonite.\r\n\r\nUtah Territory will produce an ample supply of iron.[156] According to\r\nthe Mormons, it resembles that of Missouri, and the gangue contains\r\neighty per cent. of pure metal, which, to acquire the necessary\r\ntoughness, must be alloyed with imported iron. Gold, according to\r\nHumboldt, is constant in meridional mountains, and we may expect to\r\nfind it in a country abounding with crystalline rocks cut by dikes\r\nof black and gray basalt and porous trap, gneiss, micaceous schists,\r\nclayey and slaty shales, and other argillaceous formations. It is\r\ngenerally believed that gold exists upon the Wasach Mountains, within\r\nsight of Great Salt Lake City, and in 1861 a traveling party is\r\nreported to have found a fine digging in the north. Lumps of virgin\r\nsilver are said to have been discovered upon the White Mountains, in\r\nthe south of the Territory, and Judge Ralston, I am informed, has\r\nlately hit upon a mine near the western route. Copper, zinc, and lead\r\nhave been brought from Little Salt Lake Valley and sixty miles east\r\nof the Vegas de Santa Clara. Coal, principally bituminous--like that\r\nnearer the Pacific--is found mostly in the softer limestones south of\r\nthe city, in a country of various marls, indurated clays, and earthy\r\nsandstones. In 1855 a vein of five feet thick, in quality resembling\r\nthat of Maryland, was discovered west of the San Pete Creek, on the\r\nroad to Manti. In Iron County, 250 to 280 miles south of Great Salt\r\nLake City, inexhaustible coal-beds as well as iron deposits are said to\r\nline the course of the Green River, and, that nothing may be wanting,\r\nconsiderable affluents supply abundant water-power. A new digging had\r\nbeen discovered shortly before my arrival on a tributary of the Weber\r\nRiver, east of the City of the Saints, and upon the western route\r\nmany spots were pointed out to me as future coal-mines. Timber being\r\nprincipally required for building, fencing, and mechanical purposes,\r\nrenders firewood expensive: in the city a cartage of fifteen miles\r\nis necessary, and the price is thereby raised from $7 in summer to a\r\nmaximum of $20 in the hard season per cord of sixteen by four feet.\r\nUnless the Saints would presently be reduced to the necessity of\r\n“breakfasting with Ezekiel,” they must take heart and build a tramroad\r\nto the south.\r\n\r\n  [156] Magnetic iron ore is traced in the basaltic rock; cubes of\r\n  bisulphuret of iron are found in the argillaceous schists, and cubic\r\n  crystals of iron pyrites are seen in white ferruginous quartz.\r\n\r\nSaltpetre is found--upon paper: here, as in other parts of America,\r\nit is deficient: a reward of $500 offered for a sample of gunpowder\r\nmanufactured from Valley Tan materials produced no claimants. Sulphur\r\nis only too common. Saleratus or alkaline salts is the natural produce\r\nof the soil. Borax and petroleum or mineral tar have been discovered,\r\nand the native alum has been analyzed and pronounced good by Dr.\r\nGale.[157] Rubies, emeralds, and other small but valuable stones are\r\nfound in the chinks of the primitive rocks throughout the western parts\r\nof the Territory. I have also seen chalcedony, sardonyx, carnelian, and\r\nvarious agates.\r\n\r\n  [157] 100 grammes of the freshly crystallized salt gave,\r\n\r\n  Water                   73·0\r\n  Protoxide of manganese  08·9\r\n  Alumina                 04·0\r\n  Sulphuric acid          18·0\r\n\r\nUtah Territory is pronounced by immigrants from the Old Country to\r\nbe a “mean land,” hard, dry, and fit only for the steady, sober,\r\nand hard-working Mormon. Scarcely one fiftieth part is fit for\r\ntillage; farming must be confined to rare spots, in which, however,\r\nan exceptional fertility appears. Even in the arable lands there is\r\na great variety: some do not exceed 8-10 bushels per acre, while\r\nCaptain Stansbury mentions 180 bushels[158] of wheat being raised\r\nupon 3·50 acres of ground from one bushel of seed, and estimates the\r\naverage yield of properly-cultivated land at 40 bushels, whereas rich\r\nPennsylvania rarely gives 30 per acre.[159] I have heard of lands near\r\nthe fresh-water lake which bear from 60 to 105 bushels per acre.\r\n\r\n  [158] In the United States the bushel of wheat or clover-seed is 60\r\n  lbs.; of corn, barley, and rye, 56 lbs.; of oats, 35-36 lbs.\r\n\r\n  [159] The yield in Egypt varies from 25 to 150 grains for one planted.\r\n\r\n[SOIL.]\r\n\r\nThe cultivable tracts are of two kinds, bench-land and bottom-land.\r\n\r\n[FRUITS.]\r\n\r\nThe soil of the bench-lands is fertile, a mixture of the highland\r\nfeldspath with the débris of decomposed limestone. It is comparatively\r\nfree from alkalines, the bane of the valleys; but as rain is wanting,\r\nit depends, like the Basses-Pyrénées, upon irrigation, and must be\r\nfertilized by the mountain torrents that issue from the kanyons. As a\r\nrule, the creeks dwindle to rivulets and sink in the porous alluvium\r\nbefore they have run a mile from the hill-foot, and reappear in the\r\narid plains at a level too low for navigation: in such places artesian\r\nwells are wanted. The soil, though fertile, is thin, requiring compost:\r\nmanure is here allowed to waste, the labor of the people sufficing\r\nbarely for essentials. I am informed that two bushels of semence are\r\nrequired for each acre, and that the colonists sow too scantily: a\r\njudicious rotation of crops is also yet to come. The benches are\r\nsometimes extensive: a strip, for instance, runs along the western base\r\nof the Wasach Mountains, with a varying breadth of 1-3 miles, from\r\n80 miles north of Great Salt Lake City to Utah Lake and Valley, the\r\nsouthern terminus of cultivation, a total length of 120 miles. These\r\nlands produce various cereals, especially wheat and buckwheat, oats,\r\nbarley, and a little Indian corn, all the fruits and vegetables of a\r\ntemperate zone, and flax, hemp, and linseed in abundance. The wild\r\nfruits are the service berry, choke-cherry, buffalo berry, gooseberry,\r\nan excellent strawberry, and black, white, red, and yellow mountain\r\ncurrants, some as large as ounce bullets.\r\n\r\n[ALKALINE SALTS.]\r\n\r\nThe bottom-lands, where the creeks extend, are better watered than the\r\nuplands, but they are colder and salter. The refrigerated air seeks\r\nthe lowest levels; hence in Utah Territory the benches are warmer than\r\nthe valleys, and the spring vegetation is about a fortnight later on\r\nthe banks of Jordan than above them. Another cause of cold is the\r\npresence of saleratus or alkaline salts, the natural effect of the rain\r\nbeing insufficient to wash them out. Experiment proved in Sindh that\r\nnothing is more difficult than to eradicate this evil from the soil:\r\nthe sweetest earth brought from afar becomes tainted by it: sometimes\r\nthe disease appears when the crop is half grown; at other times it\r\nattacks irregularly--one year, for instance, will see a fine field of\r\nwheat, and the next none. When inveterate, it breaks out in leprous\r\neruptions, and pieces of efflorescence can be picked up for use: a\r\nmilder form induces a baldness of growth, with an occasional birth\r\nof chenopodiaceæ. Many of the streams are dangerous to cattle, and\r\noften in the lower parts of the valleys there are ponds and pools of\r\nwater colored and flavored like common ley. According to the people,\r\na small admixture is beneficial to vegetation; the grass is rendered\r\nequal for pasturage to the far-famed salt-marshes of Essex and of the\r\nAtlantic coast; potatoes, squashes, and melons become sweeter, and\r\nthe pie-plant loses its acidity. On the other hand, the beet has been\r\nfound to deteriorate, no small misfortune at such a distance from the\r\nsugar-cane.\r\n\r\nBesides salt-drought and frost, the land has to contend against an\r\nAsiatic scourge. The cricket (_Anabrus simplex_?) is compared by the\r\nMormons to a “cross between the spider and the buffalo:” it is dark,\r\nungainly, wingless, and exceedingly harmful. The five red-legged\r\ngrasshopper (_Œdipoda corallipes_), about the size of the English\r\nmigratory locust, assists these “black Philistines,” and, but for\r\na curious provision of nature, would render the land well-nigh\r\nuninhabitable. A small species of gull flocks from its resting-place\r\nin the Great Salt Lake to feed upon the advancing host; the “glossy\r\nbird of the valley, with light red beak and feet, delicate in form and\r\nmotion, with plumage of downy texture and softness,” stayed in 1848\r\nthe advance of the “frightful bug,” whose onward march nor fires, nor\r\nhot trenches, nor the cries of the frantic farmer could arrest. We\r\ncan hardly wonder that the Mormons, whose minds, so soon after the\r\nexodus, were excited to the highest pitch, should have seen in this\r\nnatural phenomenon a miracle, a special departure from the normal\r\ncourse of events, made by Providence in their favor, or accuse them, as\r\nanti-Mormons have done, of forging signs and portents.\r\n\r\nBut, while many evils beset agriculture in Utah Territory, grazing\r\nis comparatively safe, and may be extended almost _ad libitum_. The\r\nvalleys of this land of Goshen supply plentiful pasturage in the\r\nwinter; as spring advances cattle will find gamma and other grasses\r\non the benches, and as, under the influence of the melting sun,\r\nthe snow-line creeps up the hills, flocks and herds, like the wild\r\ngraminivorants, will follow the bunch-grass, which, vivified by the\r\nautumnal rains, breeds under the snow, and bears its seed in summer.\r\nIn the basin of the Green River, fifty miles south of Fillmore City,\r\nis a fine wool-producing country 7000 square miles in area. Even the\r\nubiquitous sage will serve for camels. As has been mentioned, Durhams,\r\nDevons, and Merino tups have found their way to Great Salt Lake City,\r\nand the terrible milk-sickness[160] of the Western States has not.\r\n\r\n  [160] A fatal spasmodic disease produced in the Western States by\r\n  astringent salts in the earth and water: it first attacks cattle, and\r\n  then those who eat the infected meat or drink the milk. Travelers\r\n  tell of whole villages being destroyed by it.\r\n\r\nIn 1860 the Valley of the Great Salt Lake alone produced 306,000\r\nbushels of grain, of which about 17,000 were oats. Lieutenant Gunnison,\r\nestimating the average yield of each plowed acre at 2000 lbs. (33¹⁄₂\r\nbushels), a fair estimate, and “drawing the meat part of the ration,\r\nor one half,” from the herds fed elsewhere, fixes the maximum of\r\npopulation in Utah Territory at 4000 souls to a square mile, and opines\r\nthat it will maintain with ease one million of inhabitants.\r\n\r\nTimber, I have said, is a growing want throughout the country; the\r\n“hair of the earth-animal” is by no means luxuriant. Great Cotton-wood\r\nKanyon is supposed to contain supplies for twenty years, but it\r\nis chiefly used for building purposes. The Mormons, unlike the\r\nHibernians, of whom it was said in the last century that no man ever\r\nplanted an orchard, have applied themselves manfully to remedying the\r\ndeficiency, and the next generation will probably be safe. At present,\r\n“hard woods,” elm, hackberry, pecan or button-wood, hickory, mulberry,\r\nbasswood, locust, black and English walnut, are wanted, and must be\r\nimported from the Eastern States. The lower kanyons and bottoms are\r\nclothed with wild willow, scrub maple, both hard and soft, box elder,\r\naspen, birch, cotton-wood, and other amentaciæ, and in the south with\r\nspruce and dwarf ash. The higher grounds bear stunted cedars white and\r\nred, balsam and other pines, the dwarf oak, which, like the maple, is a\r\nmere scrub, and the mountain mahogany, a tough, hard, and strong, but\r\ngrainless wood, seldom exceeding eight inches in diameter. Hawthorn\r\n(a _Cratægus_) also exists, and in the southern and western latitudes\r\nthe piñon (_P. monophyllus_), varying from the size of an umbrella to\r\ntwenty feet in height, feeds the Indians with its oily nut, which not\r\na little resembles the seed of the pinaster and the Mediterranean _P.\r\nPinea_, and supplies a rich gum for strengthening plasters.\r\n\r\n[ANNUAL EXHIBITION IN UTAH TERRITORY.]\r\n\r\nThe present state of agriculture in the vicinity of Great Salt Lake\r\nCity will best be explained by the prospectus of the annual show for\r\n1860.[161] Wheat thrives better than maize, which in the northern\r\nparts suffers from the late frosts, and requires a longer summer. Until\r\noats and barley can be grown in sufficient quantities, horses are\r\nfed upon heating wheat, which only the hardest riding enables them\r\nto digest. _Holcus saccharatum_, or Chinese millet, succeeds where\r\ninsufficient humidity is an obstacle to the sugar-cane. The fault\r\nof the vegetables here, as in California, is excessive size, which\r\noften renders them insipid; the Irish potato, however, is superior to\r\nthat of Nova Scotia and Charleston; the onions are large and mild as\r\nthose of Spain. The white carrot, the French bean, and the cucumber\r\ngrow well, and the “multicaulis mania” has borne good fruit in the\r\nshape of cabbage. The size of the beets suggested in 1853 the project\r\noriginated in France by Napoleon the Great: $100,000 were expended upon\r\nsugar-making machinery; the experiment, however, though directed by a\r\nFrenchman, failed, it is said, on account of the alkali contained in\r\nthe root, and the Saints are accused of having distilled for sale bad\r\nspirit from the useless substance. The deserts skirting the Western\r\nHoly Land have also their manna; the leaves of poplars and other\r\ntrees on the banks of streams distill, at divers seasons of the year,\r\nglobules of honey-dew, resembling in color gum Arabic, but of softer\r\nconsistence and less adhesiveness: the people collect it with spoons\r\ninto saucers. Cotton thrives in the southern and southwestern part of\r\nUtah Territory when the winter is mild: at the meeting-place of waters\r\nnear the Green and Grand Rivers that unite to form the Colorado, the\r\nshrub has been grown with great success.\r\n\r\n  [161] List of premiums to be awarded by the Deserét Agricultural and\r\n  Manufacturing Society, at the Annual Exhibition, October 3d and 4th,\r\n  1860.\r\n\r\n  CLASS A.--CATTLE.\r\n\r\n  Awarding Committee--Hector C.

The Mormons, “flying from civilization\r\nand Christianity,” attempted to isolate themselves from the world in\r\na mountain fastness; they were foiled by an accident far beyond human\r\nforesight. They had retired to a complete oasis, defended by sterile\r\nvolcanic passes, which in winter are blocked up with snow, girt by\r\nvast waterless and uninhabitable deserts, and unapproachable from any\r\nsettled country save by a painful and dangerous march of 600-1000\r\nmiles. Presently, in 1850, the gold fever broke out on the Pacific\r\nsea-board; thousands of people not only passed through Utah Territory,\r\nbut were also compelled to remain there and work for a livelihood. The\r\ntransit received a fresh impulse in 1858 by the gold discovered at\r\nPike’s Peak, and in 1859 by the rich silver mines found in the Carson\r\nand Washoe Valleys, on the eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada. Carson\r\nValley, which was settled by Colonel Reece in 1852, and colonized\r\nin 1855 by 500 Mormons, was soon cleared of Saints by the influx of\r\nprospectors and diggers, and the other El Dorados drew off much\r\nGentile population, which was an incalculable boon to the Mormons. They\r\nthus rid themselves of the “thriving lawyers, gamblers, prostitutes,\r\ncriminals, and desperadoes, loafers, and drunkards,” who made New\r\nJerusalem a carnival of horrors. The scene is now shifted to Denver and\r\nCarson cities, where rape and robbery, intoxication and shooting are\r\nattributed to their true causes, the gathering together of a lawless\r\nand excited crowd, not to the “baleful shade of that deadly Upas-tree,\r\nMormonism.”\r\n\r\nThe Mormons, having lost all hopes of safety by isolation, now seek it\r\nin the reverse: mail communication with the Eastern and Western States\r\nis their present hobby: they look forward to markets for their produce,\r\nand to a greater facility and economy of importing. They have dreamed\r\nof a water-line to the East by means of the Missouri head-waters,\r\nwhich are said to be navigable for 350-400 miles, and to the West by\r\nthe tributaries of the Snake River, that afford 400. Shortly after\r\nthe foundation of Great Salt Lake City, they proceeded to establish,\r\nunder the ecclesiastical title “Stakes of Zion in the Wilderness,”\r\nsettlements and outposts, echelonned in skeleton, afterward to be\r\nfilled in, from Temple Block along the southern line to San Diego. The\r\nimportance of connecting the Atlantic with the Pacific by a shorter\r\nroute than the 24,000 miles of navigation round Cape Horn, has produced\r\nfirst a monthly, then a weekly, and lastly a daily mail, and has opened\r\nup a route from the Holy City to Carson Valley. So far from opposing\r\nthe Pacific Railroad, the local Legislature petitioned for it in\r\n1849, and believe that it would increase the value of their property\r\ntenfold. But as equal parts of Mormon and Gentile never could dwell\r\ntogether in amity, extensive communication would probably result in\r\ncausing the Saints to sell out, and once more to betake themselves to\r\ntheir “wilderness work” in Sonora, or in other half-settled portions\r\nof Northern Mexico. This view of the question is taken by the federal\r\nauthorities, who would willingly, if they could, confer upon the\r\npetitioners the fatal boon.\r\n\r\nThe Mormon pioneers, 143 in number, when sent westward under several\r\nof the apostles to seek for settlements, fixed upon the Valley of the\r\nGreat Salt Lake. The advance colony of 4000 souls, expelled from Nauvoo\r\non the Mississippi, and headed by “Brigham the Seer,” arrived there\r\non the 24th of July, 1847, the anniversary of which is their 4th of\r\nJuly--Independence Day. Before the end of the first week a tract of\r\nland was ditched, plowed, and planted with potatoes. City-Creek Kanyon\r\nwas dammed for irrigation; an area of forty acres was fortified after\r\nthe old New England fashion by facing log houses inward, and by a\r\npalisade of timber hauled from the ravines; the city was laid out upon\r\nthe spot where they first rested, the most eligible site in the Valley,\r\nand prayers, with solemn ceremonies, consecrated the land.\r\n\r\n[CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE OF DESERÉT.]\r\n\r\nEarly in 1849, the Mormons, irritated by the contemptuous silence of\r\nthe federal government, assembled themselves in Convention, and, with\r\nthe boldness engendered by a perfect faith, duly erected themselves\r\ninto a free, sovereign, and independent people, with a vast extent\r\nof country.[162] Disdaining to remain in _statu pupillari_, they\r\ndispensed with a long political minority, and rushed into the conclave\r\nof republics like California, whose sons are fond of comparing her\r\nto Minerva issuing full-grown from the cranium of Jupiter into the\r\nsociety of Olympus. Roused by this liberty, the Senate and House of\r\nRepresentatives of the United States of America, in Congress assembled,\r\non the 9th of September, 1850, sheared the self-constituted republic\r\nof its fair proportions, and reduced it to the infant condition of New\r\nMexico, with the usual proviso in the organic act that when qualified\r\nfor admission as states they shall become slave or free, as their\r\nrespective Constitutions may prescribe. At present one of the principal\r\nMormon grievances is that, although their country can, by virtue of\r\npopulation, claim admission into the Union, which has lately been\r\noverrun with a mushroom growth, like Michigan, Minnesota, and Oregon,\r\ntheir prayers are not only rejected, but even their petitions remain\r\nunnoticed. The cause is, I believe, polygamy, which, until the statute\r\nlaw is altered, would not and could not be tolerated, either in America\r\nor in England. To the admission of other Territories, Kansas, for\r\ninstance, the slavery question was the obstacle. The pro party will\r\nadmit none who will not support the South, and _vice versâ_. Perhaps\r\nit is well so, otherwise the old and civilized states would soon find\r\nthemselves swamped by batches of peers in rapidly succeeding creations.\r\n\r\n  [162] The following is the preamble to the Constitution: it is a fair\r\n  specimen of Mormon plain-dealing.\r\n\r\n  Provisional Government of the State of Deserét.--Abstract of\r\n  Convention Minutes.

Albert Carrington, chairman of the Committee,\r\n  reported the following Constitution, which was read and unanimously\r\n  adopted by the Convention:\r\n\r\n  CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE OF DESERÉT.\r\n\r\n  PREAMBLE.--Whereas a large number of the citizens of the United\r\n  States, before and since the Treaty of Peace with the Republic of\r\n  Mexico, emigrated to, and settled in that portion of the territory of\r\n  the United States lying west of the Rocky Mountains, and in the great\r\n  interior Basin of Upper California; and\r\n\r\n  Whereas, by reason of said treaty, all civil organization originating\r\n  from the Republic of Mexico became abrogated; and\r\n\r\n  Whereas the Congress of the United States has failed to provide\r\n  a form of civil government for the territory so acquired, or any\r\n  portion thereof; and\r\n\r\n  Whereas civil government and laws are necessary for the security,\r\n  peace, and prosperity of society; and\r\n\r\n  Whereas it is a fundamental principle in all republican governments\r\n  that all political power is inherent in the people, and governments\r\n  instituted for their protection, security, and benefit should emanate\r\n  from the same:\r\n\r\n  Therefore your committee beg leave to recommend the adoption of the\r\n  following CONSTITUTION until the Congress of the United States shall\r\n  otherwise provide for the government of the Territory hereinafter\r\n  named and described by admitting us into the Union. WE, THE PEOPLE,\r\n  grateful to the SUPREME BEING for the blessings hitherto enjoyed, and\r\n  feeling our dependence on Him for a continuation of those blessings,\r\n  DO ORDAIN AND ESTABLISH A FREE AND INDEPENDENT GOVERNMENT, by the\r\n  name of the STATE OF DESERÉT, including all the territory of the\r\n  United States within the following boundaries, to wit: commencing at\r\n  the 33° of north latitude, where it crosses the 108° of longitude,\r\n  west of Greenwich; thence running south and west to the boundary of\r\n  Mexico; thence west to and down the main channel of the Gila River\r\n  (or the northern line of Mexico), and on the northern boundary\r\n  of Lower California to the Pacific Ocean; thence along the coast\r\n  northwesterly to the 118° 30′ of west longitude; thence north to\r\n  where said line intersects the dividing ridge of the Sierra Nevada\r\n  mountains; thence north along the summit of the Sierra Nevada\r\n  mountains to the dividing range of mountains that separate the waters\r\n  flowing into the Columbia River from the waters running into the\r\n  Great Basin; thence easterly along the dividing range of mountains\r\n  that separate said waters flowing into the Columbia River on the\r\n  north, from the waters flowing into the Great Basin on the south, to\r\n  the summit of the Wind River chain of mountains; thence southeast and\r\n  south by the dividing range of mountains that separate the waters\r\n  flowing into the Gulf of Mexico from the waters flowing into the Gulf\r\n  of California, to the place of beginning, as set forth in a map drawn\r\n  by Charles Preuss, and published by order of the Senate of the United\r\n  States in 1848.\r\n\r\nThe Mormons have another complaint, touching the tenure of their land.\r\nThe United States have determined that the Indian title has not been\r\nextinguished. The Saints declare that no tribe of aborigines could\r\nprove a claim to the country, otherwise they were ready to purchase it\r\nin perpetuity by pay, presents, and provisions, besides establishing\r\nthe usual reservations. Moreover, the federal government has departed\r\nfrom the usual course. The law directs that the land, when set off into\r\ntownships, six miles square with subdivisions,[163] must be sold at\r\nauction to the highest bidder. The Mormons represent that although a\r\nsurvey of considerable tracts has been completed by a federal official,\r\nthey are left to be mere squatters that can be ejected like an Irish\r\ntenantry, because the government, knowing their ability and readiness\r\nto pay the recognized pre-emption price ($1 25 per acre), fear lest\r\nthose now in possession should become lawful owners and permanent\r\nproprietors of the soil.[164] Polygamy is here again to blame.\r\n\r\n  [163] Viz., the section of one square mile, the half section =320\r\n  acres, and the quarter section of 160 acres: the latter is the legal\r\n  grant to military settlers. The pre-emption laws in the United States\r\n  are just and precise; but in the mountains it is about as easy to\r\n  eject a squatter as to collect “rint” from Western Galway in the days\r\n  of Mr. Martin.\r\n\r\n  [164] In England and Scotland the rent for use of land averages one\r\n  quarter of the gross produce; in France, one third; unhappy India\r\n  gives one half; and the Territories of the United States nearly\r\n  nothing.\r\n\r\nThe Mormon settlements resemble those of the French in Canada and\r\nelsewhere rather than the English in Australia, the Dutch at the\r\nCape, or the American squatters on the Western frontier. They eschew\r\nsolitude, and cluster together round the Church and the succedaneum for\r\nthe priest. In establishing these “stakes” they proceed methodically.\r\nA tentative expedition, sent out to select the point presenting the\r\ngreatest facilities for settlements, is followed by a volunteer band\r\nof Saints, composed of farmers, mechanics, and artisans, headed by an\r\napostle, president, elder, or some other dignitary. The foundations are\r\nlaid with long ceremonies. The fort or block-house is first built, and\r\nwhen the people are lodged the work of agriculture begins. The cities\r\nof Utah Territory are somewhat like the “towns” of Cornwall. At present\r\nthere are three long lines of these juvenile settlements established\r\nas caravanserais in the several oases. The first is along the Humboldt\r\nRiver to Carson Valley; the second is by the southern route, _viâ_\r\nFillmore; and the third is betwixt the two, along “Egan’s Route,” the\r\npresent mail line.\r\n\r\n[COUNTIES IN UTAH TERRITORY.]\r\n\r\nThe counties, originally 5, increased in 1855 to 12, are now (1860) 19\r\nin number, viz.:\r\n\r\n1. Great Salt Lake County: the chief town is Great Salt Lake City; the\r\nsub-settlements are the Sugar-House, 4 miles S. of Temple Block--the\r\ninvariable _point de départ_; Mill Creek, 7 miles; Great Cotton-wood,\r\n8-9 miles; West Jordan, Jordan Mills, Herriman, and Union, or Little\r\nCotton-wood Creek, 12 miles; Drapersville, 20-21 miles S.; all small\r\nvillages, with good farming lands.\r\n\r\n2. Utah County: the chief town is Provo or Provaux, on the Timpanogos\r\nRiver, 45 miles; David City, on Dry Creek, 28 miles; Lake City, on\r\nAmerican Fork, 32 miles S.; Lehi City, 35 miles S.; Lone City, 37 miles\r\nS.; Pleasant Grove or Battle Creek, 41 miles S.; Springville or Hobble\r\nCreek, 53-54 miles; Palmyra, a small place east of the Lake, and north\r\nof Spanish Fork, 59-60 miles; Spanish-Fork City, 61 miles S.; Pondtown,\r\n64 miles S.; Payson City, on both banks of the Peet-Neet Creek, 64-65\r\nmiles S.; and Santa Quin, 74 miles S.\r\n\r\n3. Davis County: chief town Farmington; others, Stoker, Centreville,\r\n12·50 miles N., and Kaysville, 22 miles N.\r\n\r\n4. Weber County: chief town Ogden City, on both sides of Ogden River,\r\n40 miles E.; also North Ogden.\r\n\r\n5. Iron County: chief town Parovan, so called from the Pavant Indians;\r\nbuilt on Centre Creek, 255 miles S. of Great Salt Lake City, and 96\r\nmiles from Fillmore, and incorporated in 1851. Also Cedar City, near\r\nLittle Salt Lake, 275 miles S.; St. Joseph’s Springs and Vegas de\r\nSanta Clara, 200 miles from Cedar City. The Aztecs, as their rock\r\ninscriptions prove, once extended to Little Salt Lake Valley.\r\n\r\n6. Tooele County: chief town Tooele City, 32 miles W.; also “Eastern\r\nTooele City,” 26 miles W.; Grantsville, 27 miles W.; Richville and\r\nCedar Valley, 40 miles W.\r\n\r\n7. San Pete Valley County and City, 131 miles, laid out by the\r\npresidency in 1849, and incorporated in 1850; Fort Ephraim, 130 miles;\r\nManti City, 140 miles, on the southern declivity of Mount Nebo. Aztecan\r\npictographs have been found upon the cliffs in San Pete Valley.\r\n\r\n8. Juab County: chief town Salt Creek, in a valley separated from Utah\r\nValley by a ridge, on which runs Summit Creek.\r\n\r\n9. Box-Elder County and City, 60 miles N.; also Willow Creek and\r\nBrigham’s City.\r\n\r\n[COAL.]\r\n\r\n10. Washington County: chief town Fort Harmony, on Ash Creek, 291 miles\r\nS., and 20 miles N. of Rio Virgen.[165]\r\n\r\n  [165] I annex a description of Washington County, which lately\r\n  appeared in the “Deserét News:”\r\n\r\n  “Yesterday afternoon I met in the library of the University the\r\n  Hon. Wm. Crosby, the representative from Washington County to\r\n  our Legislature, who furnishes me with some items of information\r\n  respecting the county he represents worthy a passing notice,\r\n  especially as there is so little known of that county. The\r\n  inhabitants are estimated at about 1500 persons, chiefly engaged in\r\n  farming and grazing. The county of Washington in area is as large as\r\n  the State of Connecticut, generally of a barren, desert character,\r\n  broken and mountainous. On the borders of the Rio Virgen and the\r\n  Santa Clara there are narrow strips of land exceedingly fertile, on\r\n  which every thing grows with great richness, and at a cost of very\r\n  little labor. During the present year only 50,000 pounds of cotton\r\n  have been raised, but, properly cultivated and attended to, the\r\n  inhabitants there could raise all the cotton ever required by the\r\n  inhabitants of this Territory. At present its cultivation is almost\r\n  neglected for the want of proper facilities for its manufacture.\r\n  The entrance also of the army in 1857, followed by immense trains\r\n  of goods--which, by-the-by, some of the merchants never paid a cent\r\n  for, and it is very doubtful if they ever will--was also a crushing\r\n  competition to the people of Washington County.\r\n\r\n  “Every kind of fruit that has been tried there grows with great\r\n  luxuriance. The apple, pear, plum, apricot, peach, and fig trees do\r\n  exceedingly well. The English walnut-tree grew this year nine feet,\r\n  and the Catawba grape grew nineteen feet and a half before the 6th\r\n  of September. The bunches of those grapes, many of them, measured\r\n  nineteen inches in length. At Tocqueville, one of the small towns in\r\n  that county, one man raised this year two water-melons from one vine\r\n  that weighed, the one sixty, and the other fifty pounds.\r\n\r\n  “At the Agricultural Exhibition, held there last September, the fine\r\n  grapes which I have mentioned were on exhibition. At the same time\r\n  there was exhibited a stalk of cotton containing three hundred and\r\n  seven forms; a radish measuring eighteen inches in circumference; a\r\n  sunflower head thirty-six inches; and a monster castor-bean stalk;\r\n  a sweet potato-vine five feet and a half long; and one Isabella\r\n  grape-vine twenty-five feet long. One man had in his garden trees\r\n  which in six months grew as follows:\r\n\r\n                   ft.  in.\r\n  Washington Plum   8    6\r\n  Apple-trees       6    6\r\n  Apricots          7    0\r\n  Figs              7    0\r\n  Almond            7    2\r\n  Peach             8    6\r\n  Pears             6    0\r\n\r\n  “In climate, Washington embraces all the varieties from frigid to\r\n  torrid, from regions of perpetual frost to an eternal spring. Every\r\n  kind of out-door work, plowing, ditching, building, etc., can be\r\n  pursued throughout winter in some parts of the county, while in\r\n  others there are killing frosts throughout the whole year.\r\n\r\n  “I had almost forgotten to mention that the soil is excellent for the\r\n  grape, and during the present year very fine tobacco has been grown\r\n  there, as well as madder and indigo. The sorghum raised there has\r\n  a magnificent flavor, and without the ‘patent fixings,’ with very\r\n  little labor, and that of the simplest character, good sugar is made\r\n  from it. At the late exhibition the sorghum took the two highest\r\n  prizes. I believe the honorable member from Washington has brought\r\n  with him a few gallons of this very fine molasses as a _cadeau_ to\r\n  the Prophet. To readers who have every luxury in abundance and at\r\n  very moderate figures, these items may have little interest, but to\r\n  those who watch the progress of the people here, and the reclaiming\r\n  of the desert, this information has great significance. In a few\r\n  years every thing that the people require will be raised from their\r\n  own soil, and manufactured by their own hands.\r\n\r\n  “Mr. Crosby, from whom I elicited these facts, was born in Indiana,\r\n  but ‘brought up’ in the Southern States. Mormonism got hold of him in\r\n  1843, in the State of Mississippi. Following the fortunes of Brigham,\r\n  he brought some nine or ten slaves, ‘very select niggers.’ In 1851\r\n  he went over to San Bernardino, and was bishop over there. The state\r\n  soon liberated the ebony folks, and Mr. Crosby, of course, lost his\r\n  $9000 or $10,000 by the operation.\r\n\r\n  “The Superintendent of the Church Public Works and a few others went\r\n  out exploring for coal about the Weber some time in August last,\r\n  and found a splendid bed of mineral. It promises to be the greatest\r\n  blessing that has yet fallen to the lot of the Saints. Of course I do\r\n  not look at things with ‘an eye of faith;’ that is their business.\r\n  But among people paying $10 per cord for wood, scarce at that, and\r\n  sure to be scarcer, the discovery of coal is an important matter. The\r\n  present coal-bed is about fifty miles distant; but, nevertheless,\r\n  paying $3 per ton at the mouth of the pit, at which it is now sold,\r\n  it can be brought into the city and sold for $20. Last year it was\r\n  sold here to blacksmiths for $40. The Pacific Railroad folks should\r\n  have an eye on this. The apprehension that the absence of coal and\r\n  wood in the Territory would be a serious obstacle need not now exist.\r\n  Though the wood is scarce and high priced as an article of daily\r\n  household consumption, railroad companies can get all the lumber they\r\n  require for money, though they may have to haul it far and pay a good\r\n  price for it. I believe that the whole country is full of coal, and\r\n  what is not coal is gold and silver; but I earnestly hope that the\r\n  day is far distant before the Mormons or any body else discover the\r\n  precious metals. The coal discovery, however, is very important. The\r\n  bishops of the city have been instructed to urge upon their flocks\r\n  the hauling of it, and it is hoped that by constant travel the snow\r\n  will be kept down and the roads clear all the winter. A Scotch miner,\r\n  who had just returned from the coal-bed, told me the other day that\r\n  it far exceeded any thing that he had ever seen in his own country,\r\n  or in the States, both in quality and abundance.”\r\n\r\n11. Millard County: chief town, which is also the capital of Utah\r\nTerritory, Fillmore, in N. lat. 38° 58′ 40″, in a central position, 152\r\nmiles S. of Great Salt Lake City, 600 miles E. of San Francisco, and\r\n1200 miles W. of St. Louis. The sum of $20,000 was expended upon public\r\nbuildings, but the barrenness of the soil has reduced the population\r\nfrom 100 to a dozen families.\r\n\r\n12. Green River County: Fort Supply.\r\n\r\n13. Cedar County: chief town Cedar City. It is built upon an old\r\nAztecan foundation, rich in pottery and other remains.\r\n\r\n14. Malad County: chief town Fort Malad, properly so called from its\r\nslow, brackish, and nauseous river.\r\n\r\n15. Cache County, the granary of Mormonland, and the most fertile spot\r\nin the Great Basin; well settled and much valued: chief town Cache\r\nValley, 80 miles N.\r\n\r\n16. Beaver County: chief town Beaver Creek, 220 miles S.\r\n\r\n17. Shambip County: Rich Valley and Deep Creek.\r\n\r\n18. Salt Lake Islands.\r\n\r\n19. St. Mary’s County: west of Shambip City, extending to the Humboldt\r\nRiver; chief settlement, Deep Creek.\r\n\r\nI found it impossible to arrive at a true estimate of the population.\r\nLike the earlier English numberings of the people, which originated in\r\nbitter political controversies--the charge of unfairness was brought\r\nas late as 1831 against the enumerators in Ireland--the census is a\r\npurely party measure. The Mormons, desiring to show the 100,000 persons\r\nwhich entitle them to claim admission as a state into the Union, are\r\nnaturally disposed to exaggerate their numbers; they are, of course,\r\naccused of “cooking up” schedules, of counting cattle as souls, and of\r\nmaking every woman a mother in _esse_ as in _posse_. On the other hand,\r\nthe anti-Mormons are as naturally inclined to underestimate: moreover,\r\nas the “census marshals” receive but three halfpence per head, they are\r\nby no means disposed to pay a shilling for the trouble of ransacking\r\nevery ranch and kanyon where the people repair for grazing and other\r\npurposes. The nearest approach to truth will probably be met by\r\nassuming the two opposite extremes, and by “splitting the difference.”\r\n\r\n[POPULATION OF UTAH TERRITORY.]\r\n\r\nIn 1849 Mr. Kelly estimated the Mormons to be “about 5000 inhabitants\r\nin the town, and 7000 more in the settlements.” In 1850 the seventh\r\nofficial census of the United States numbered the inhabitants of Utah\r\nTerritory at 11,354 free + 26 slaves = 11,380 souls. In 1853 the Saints\r\nwere reckoned at 25,000 by the Gentiles, and 30,000 to 35,000 by Mr.\r\nO. Pratt, in the “Seer.” In 1854 Dr. S. W. Richards estimated the\r\nnumber at “probably from 40,000 to 50,000” in the United States, and in\r\nGreat Britain at 29,797. In 1856 the Mormon census gave 76,335 souls.\r\nI subjoin a synopsis of the official papers.[166] In 1858 the Peace\r\nCommissioners sent to Utah Territory reported that the Saints did not\r\nexceed 40,000 to 50,000 souls, half of them foreigners, and that they\r\ncould bring 7000 men, of whom 1000 were valuable for cavalry, into the\r\nfield. In 1859 M. Remy made the number of Saints in Utah Territory, not\r\nincluding Nevada, 80,000 souls, and the total in the world 186,000. The\r\nlast official census, in 1860, was taken under peculiar disadvantages.\r\nGeneral Burr, of the firm of Hockaday and Burr, was appointed to\r\nthat duty by Mr. Dotson, the anti-Mormon federal marshal. But as the\r\nchoice excited loud murmurs, the task was committed to a clerk in\r\nthe general’s store, and deputies for the rest of the Territory were\r\nsimilarly chosen. The consequence is that the Gentile marshal’s census\r\nof 1860 offers a number of 40,266 free + 29 slaves = a total of 40,295\r\nsouls; while the Mormons assert their Territory to contain from 90,000\r\nto 100,000, and the world to hold from 300,000 to 400,000 Saints. Their\r\nrise is remarkable, even if we take the statistics of the enemy, which\r\nshow nearly a quadrupling of the population in ten years, while Great\r\nBritain creeps on at a rate of about ten per cent.: a similar increase\r\nwill in the ninth census of 1870 give in round numbers 160,000 persons.\r\nUtah Territory now ranks second in the eight minor states: New Mexico\r\n(93,541) and District of Columbia (75,076) take precedence of it, and\r\nit is followed by Colorado (34,197), Nebraska (28,842), Washington\r\n(11,578), Nevada (6857), and Dakotah (4839).\r\n\r\n  [166] The following is a condensed Report of the enumeration of the\r\n  inhabitants of Utah Territory, taken February, 1856:\r\n\r\n  +----------------------+------+--------+------+\r\n  |       Counties.      |Males.|Females.|Total.|\r\n  +----------------------+------+--------+------+\r\n  |Great Salt Lake County|12,730| 13,074 |25,804|\r\n  |Utah              „   | 6,951|  7,614 |14,565|\r\n  |Davis             „   | 4,765|  4,575 | 9,340|\r\n  |Weber             „   | 3,486|  3,585 | 7,071|\r\n  |Iron              „   | 2,474|  2,943 | 5,417|\r\n  |Tooele            „   | 1,315|  1,673 | 2,988|\r\n  |San Pete          „   | 1,110|  1,133 | 2,243|\r\n  |Juab              „   |   807|  1,034 | 1,841|\r\n  |Box-Elder         „   |   822|    717 | 1,539|\r\n  |Washington        „   |   742|    778 | 1,520|\r\n  |Millard           „   |   544|    512 | 1,056|\r\n  |Green River       „   |   394|    345 |   739|\r\n  |Cedar             „   |   312|    369 |   681|\r\n  |Malad             „   |   259|    208 |   467|\r\n  |Cache             „   |   240|    223 |   463|\r\n  |Beaver            „   |   118|    126 |   244|\r\n  |Shambip           „   |    83|     64 |   147|\r\n  |Salt Lake Islands     |   125|     85 |   210|\r\n  |                      +------+--------+------+\r\n  |                      |37,277| 39,058 |76,335|\r\n  +----------------------+------+--------+------+\r\n\r\n  “Great Salt Lake City, March 1st, 1856.\r\n\r\n  “I do hereby certify that the above is a correct enumeration of\r\n  the white inhabitants of Utah Territory, according to the reports\r\n  furnished by my assistants, and which are now on file in my office.\r\n\r\n  LEONARD W.

The late Mr. Stephen A. Douglas,\r\nwho was supposed to know and to befriend the Saints, asserted it to\r\nbe one to ten. This will not hold good if applied to the authorities,\r\nand if it fails at the head it will be inapplicable to the baser part\r\nof the body politic, for the American in Mormondom is the prophet,\r\npresident, apostle, bishop, or other high dignitary who leavens\r\nthe lump of ignorance and superstition kneaded together in the old\r\ncountries. Of the thirteen members of the Upper House, there were, in\r\n1860, ten Americans, two English, and one Irishman: of the officers,\r\nviz., secretary and his assistant, sergeant-at-arms, messenger,\r\nfireman, and chaplain, four were Americans, one English, and one\r\nIrishman. The members of the Lower House, twenty-six in number,\r\nconsisted of twenty-four Americans and two Englishmen, including the\r\nspeaker, Mr. John Taylor: of its six officers, four were Americans, one\r\nEnglish, and one Scotchman. Both houses were thus distributed:\r\n\r\n  New York       13\r\n  Massachusetts   6\r\n  Vermont         5\r\n  England         4\r\n  Ohio            4\r\n  Tennessee       3\r\n  Kentucky        2\r\n  Ireland         2\r\n  Scotland        1\r\n  New Hampshire   2\r\n  Isle of Man     1\r\n  Pennsylvania    2\r\n  Virginia        1\r\n  Indiana         2\r\n  Rhode Island    1\r\n                 --\r\n  Grand Total    49\r\n\r\nThe Mormon emigration is without exception the most interesting\r\nfeature in their scheme. There is an evident selection of species\r\nin the supply: a man must be superior to many in “grit” and energy\r\nwho voluntarily leaves his native land. As regards the national\r\nclassification of the converts, it may be observed that the supply\r\ndepends upon the freedom of religious discussion at home. Great\r\nBritain supplies five times more than all the rest of the world,\r\nexcepting Denmark. France must be proselytized through the Channel\r\nIslands, and there are few converts of the Latin race, which\r\nspeaks a strange language, and is too much attached to the soil\r\nfor extensive colonization. Sweden sends forth few (67)--a fine of\r\ntwenty-six rix-dollars has there been imposed upon all who harbor,\r\nlet rooms to, or hold to service a Mormon; Denmark supplies many\r\n(502), because the Constitution of 1849 guaranteed to her religious\r\nliberty; Switzerland is, after a fashion, Republican; Germany gives\r\nthe fewest. Propagandism has not yet been thoroughly organized east of\r\nFather Rhine; moreover, the Teuton, whose faith is mostly subordinate\r\nto his fancy, finds superior inducements to settle while passing\r\nthrough the Eastern States. All the “diverts” long retain their\r\nmotherlandish characteristics, and, associating together, are often\r\nunable to understand the English sermon at the Tabernacle. The work of\r\nproselytizing is slow in the United States; the analytic Anglo-American\r\nprefers the _rôle_ of knave to that of fool, besides _un saint n’est\r\npas honoré dans son pays_, upon the principle that no man is a hero\r\nto his valet. At Great Salt Lake City I saw neither Kanaka, Hindoo,\r\nnor Chinese; these “exotics” have probably withered out since the\r\ndays of M. Remy; only one negro met my sight, and though a few Yutas,\r\nprincipally Weber River, were seen in the streets, none of them had\r\nMormonized.\r\n\r\n[MORMON EMIGRATION.]\r\n\r\nEmigration in Mormondom, like El Hajj in El Islam, is the fulfillment\r\nof a divine command. As soon as the Saints could afford it, they\r\nestablished, under the direction of the First Presidency, a fund\r\nfor importing poor converts, appointed a committee for purchasing\r\ntransports, and established in Europe and elsewhere agents, who\r\ncollected $5000 in the first, and $20,000 in the second year. In\r\nSeptember, 1850, a committee of three officers was appointed to\r\ntransact the business of the poor fund, and an ordinance was passed\r\nincorporating the “Perpetual Emigration Fund Company,” consisting\r\nof thirteen members, including the First President. The Saint whose\r\npassage is thus defrayed works out his debt in the public _ateliers_\r\nof the Tithing Office Department, under the superintendence of the\r\nThird President; he is supplied with food from the “Deserét Store,” and\r\nreceives half the value of his labor, besides which a tithe of his time\r\nand toil is free. The anti-Mormons declare that by this means the faces\r\nof the poor are ground: I doubt that so far-seeing a people as the\r\nMormons would attempt so suicidal a policy.\r\n\r\nAccording to the late agent at Liverpool, and publisher of the\r\n“Millennial Star,” Dr. S. W. Richards (Select Committee on Emigrant\r\nShips, 1854, No. 12, p. 8), the Mormon emigration, under its authorized\r\nagent and passenger-broker, is better regulated than under the\r\nprovisions of the Passengers’ Act; the sexes are berthed apart, and\r\nmany home comforts are provided for the emigrants. In 1854 it was\r\nestimated not to exceed 3000 souls per annum, and of 2600 the English\r\nwere 1430, 250 Welsh, 200 Scotch, and about a score of Irish, making a\r\ntotal of 1900 Britons to 700 from the Continent. The classes preferred\r\nby the Fund are agriculturists and mechanics--the latter being at\r\na premium--moral, industrious, and educated people, “qualified to\r\nincrease and enhance the interest of the community they go among.” From\r\nLiverpool, whence all the emigration proceeds, to New Orleans, the\r\npassage-money varied from £3 12_s._ 6_d._ to £4, and from New Orleans\r\nto Great Salt Lake City £20 each. Of late years that line has been\r\nabandoned as unhealthy: the route now lies by rail through New York\r\nand Chicago to Florence, on the Missouri River. The emigration season\r\nis January, February, and March, and the passage can be made at the\r\nquickest in twenty-two days.\r\n\r\n[MORMON EMIGRATION.]\r\n\r\nI now proceed to figures, which are given in full detail, and can\r\neasily be verified by a reference to Liverpool. The official reports\r\nare subjoined, because they speak well for Mormon accuracy.[167] From\r\n1840-54 they reckon 17,195 souls, and from 1854-55, 4716 souls; the\r\ntotal in fifteen years (1840-55) being 21,911. From 1855-56 they number\r\n4395 souls, and from the 1st of July, 1857, to the 30th of June, 1860,\r\nthey count 2433, making for the five subsequent years (1855-60) a\r\ntotal of 6828. Thus, in the twenty years between 1840-60, they show a\r\ngrand total of 28,739 immigrants. They expect for the present year an\r\nemigration of 1500 to 2000 souls from the British Isles, independent of\r\nsome hundreds from the Scandinavian, Swiss, and other missions. Already\r\n200 teams have been dispatched from Great Salt Lake City to assist with\r\ntransport and provisions the poor emigrants from Florence. The Holy\r\nLand of the West would soon be populous were it not for two obstacles:\r\nfirst, the expense and difficulty of the outward journey; secondly,\r\nthe facility of emigration to the gold regions of Pike’s Peak and the\r\nsilver mines of the Nevada.\r\n\r\n  [167]\r\n\r\n  No. I.--_List of Latter-Day Saints’ Emigration, from January 6th,\r\n  1851, to May 15th, 1861._\r\n\r\n  +-----------------+---------------------+-------------+-------------+\r\n  |Date of Sailing. |       Vessel.       |  Captain.   |No. of Souls.|\r\n  +-----------------+---------------------+-------------+-------------+\r\n  |1851, January 6  |Ellen                |Phillips     |       466   |\r\n  |         „    22 |G.

E. Fund, hand-cart, and team arrangements. But we have\r\n  good cause to presume that a large number of those who left here\r\n  with the intention of settling for a short time in the States (and\r\n  are included in the table under that head) have also gone through to\r\n  Utah, without settling on the way.\r\n\r\n  The number of natives of the various countries may be classified\r\n  as follows: From the United Kingdom of Great Britain and\r\n  Ireland--English, 1074; Scotch, 126; Welsh, 173; Irish, 12. The total\r\n  number from the Scandinavian Mission is 762, of which there are 528\r\n  Danes, 193 Swedes, and 41 Norwegians. The total number from the Swiss\r\n  and Italian Mission is 211, of which 209 are from the Swiss Cantons,\r\n  and 2 from Italy. There are also 2 French, 3 Germans, and 70 elders\r\n  returning home from missions, making a grand total, as per table, of\r\n  2433 souls.\r\n\r\n  _Countries._--The number of natives of the various countries may be\r\n  classified as follows:\r\n\r\n  England                             2611\r\n    (Principal counties--Lancashire,\r\n      Yorkshire, and Staffordshire.)\r\n  Scotland                             367\r\n  Wales                                667\r\n                                       -----3645\r\n  Ireland                               54\r\n  America                               19\r\n  French Mission (Channel Islands)       9\r\n  Denmark      }                   {   505\r\n  Sweden       } Scandinavian      {    67\r\n  Norway       }                   {    46\r\n  Swiss Cantons                         19\r\n  Piedmont, Italy                       31\r\n  East India Mission                     2\r\n  Germany                                1\r\n                                       ----- 750\r\n                                            ----\r\n                Total                       4395 souls.\r\n\r\n  The emigration in 1861 is progressing satisfactorily, as the\r\n  following extract proves:\r\n\r\n  “A party of Mormonites, consisting of 17 men, 25 women, and 11\r\n  children, left London lately by the Northwestern Railway for\r\n  Liverpool, _en route_ for the Salt Lake settlement. The emigration\r\n  of Mormonites from Great Britain, particularly from the southern\r\n  district of Wales, has during the past ten weeks been on a large\r\n  scale. Their number embraces all classes; one gentleman, an\r\n  inhabitant of Merthyr, Glamorganshire, having contributed £1000, and\r\n  joined the ‘brethren,’ 200 of whom, including an old woman upward of\r\n  eighty years of age, have just left Wales.”\r\n\r\n  No. III.--_Latter-Day Saints’ Emigration, Spring of 1861._\r\n\r\n  42 Islington, Liverpool, June 29th, 1861.\r\n\r\n  Per Ship Manchester, Captain Frask.\r\n\r\n             Males.

In these\r\nisles there is a general Presidency of the Church, assisted by a\r\ncounselor: these preside over the pastors or presidents of districts,\r\nten in number, who also, assisted by counselors in their turn, direct\r\nand counsel the presidents of the twenty-four Conferences, while these\r\nsuperintend the presidents of the 400 branches. The total of members\r\nin the whole European mission is not less than 40,000. I subjoin a\r\nlist of the various places--kindly furnished to me by an influential\r\nSaint--which the Mormons have selected for worship in London.[168]\r\n\r\n  [168]\r\n\r\n  _Latter-Day Saints’ Meeting Rooms in London and vicinity_:\r\n\r\n  _Somers Town_--Euston Hall, 8 George Street, Hampstead Road.\r\n\r\n  _Holborn_--148 Holborn, near Gray’s Inn Lane.\r\n\r\n  _Goswell Hall_--46 Goswell Street.\r\n\r\n  _Holloway_--1 Cornwall Place, Holloway Road.\r\n\r\n  _Whitechapel_--Pisgah Chapel, North Street, Sydney Street, Mile End.\r\n\r\n  _Poplar_--28 Penny Fields.\r\n\r\n  _Barking_--Latter-Day Saints’ Chapel, North Street.\r\n\r\n  _Paddington_--Hope Hall, Bell Street.\r\n\r\n  _Chelsea_--Lloyd’s Assembly Rooms, 1 George Street, Sloane Square.\r\n\r\n  _Shepherd’s Bush_--Latter-Day Saint’s Chapel, Shepherd’s Bush Green.\r\n\r\n  _Camden Town_--Beulah Cottage, King’s Road, Camden Town.\r\n\r\n  _On the Surrey Side of the Thames._\r\n\r\n  _Walworth Common_--Latter-Day Saints’ Meeting Room, 2 King Street,\r\n  Old Kent Road.\r\n\r\n  _Lambeth_--St. George’s Hall, St. George’s Road, near the Elephant\r\n  and Castle.\r\n\r\n  _Deptford_--Latter-Day Saints’ Meeting Room, Tanner’s Hill.\r\n\r\n  _Woolwich_--Latter-Day Saints’ Chapel, Prospect Row.\r\n\r\n  _Welling_--Latter-Day Saints’ Meeting Room, Wickham Lane, near\r\n  Welling.\r\n\r\n  _Eltham_--Latter-Day Saints’ Meeting Room, at Mr. J. Baily’s, Pound\r\n  Place.\r\n\r\nTwo points in this subject are truly remarkable. The first is the\r\ndifference between Utah Territory and all other Anglo-Scandinavian\r\ncolonies, in which males are usually far more numerous than females.\r\nThe latter, at Utah, by the census of 1856, are 1781 in excess of the\r\nformer; almost as great a disproportion as the extra three quarters of\r\na million in England. The second is the rapid growth of the New Faith,\r\nand the deep hold which it has taken upon Great Britain. Few Englishmen\r\nare aware that their metropolis contains seventeen places of Mormon\r\nworship, and their fatherland an army of 4000 volunteer missionaries.\r\nIn the United States it is also the fashion to ignore the Mormons. The\r\nsubject, however, will grow in importance, and it is easy to predict\r\nthat before two decades shall have elapsed, Deserét, unless sent once\r\nmore upon her travels, will have forced herself into the position of an\r\nindependent state.\r\n\r\n[MORMON POLITY.]\r\n\r\nThe Mormon polity is, in my humble opinion--based upon the fact that\r\nliberty is to mankind in mass a burden far heavier than slavery--the\r\nperfection of government. It is the universal suffrage of the American\r\nStates, tempered by the despotism of France and Russia: in moderate\r\nEngland men have nothing of it but that Tory-Radicalism to which the\r\nfew of extremest opinions belong. At the semi-annual Conferences,\r\nwhich take place on the 6th of April and the 6th of October, and last\r\nfor four days, all officers, from the President to the constable,\r\nare voted in by direction and counsel--_i. e._, of the Lord through\r\nhis Prophet; consequently, re-election is the rule, unless the chief\r\ndictator determine otherwise. Every adult male has a vote, and all\r\nlive under an iron sway. His poor single vote--from which even the\r\nsting of ballot has been drawn--gratifies the dignity of the man, and\r\nsatisfies him with the autocracy which directs him in the way he should\r\ngo. He has thus all the harmless pleasure of voting, without the danger\r\nof injuring himself by his vote. The reverse, duly carried out, frees\r\nmankind from king and kaiser, and subjects them to snobs and mobs.\r\nMormon society is modeled upon a civilized regiment: the Prophet is\r\nthe colonel commanding, and the grades are nicely graduated down to\r\nthe last neophyte or recruit. I know no form of rule superior to that\r\nof Great Salt Lake City; it might supply the author of “Happy Years\r\nat Hand” with new ideas for the “Outlines of the Coming Theocracy.”\r\nIt exerts its beneficial effects equally upon the turbulent and\r\nindependent American; the sensible and self-sufficient Englishman; the\r\nFrenchman, ever lusting after new things; the Switzer, with his rude\r\nlove of a most problematic liberty; the outwardly cold, inwardly fiery\r\nScandinavian; the Italian, ready to bow down before any practice, with\r\nthe one proviso that it must be successful; and the German, who demands\r\nto be governed by theories and Utopianisms, “worked” by professors “out\r\nof the depths of their self-consciousness.”\r\n\r\nThe following description of a Conference is extracted at length from\r\nthe “Daily Missouri Republican” of May 4, 1861:\r\n\r\n  _Great Salt Lake City, April 12, 1861._\r\n\r\n  On the 6th of April, 1830, in a small room about fifteen feet square,\r\n  in the town of Fayette, Seneca County, New York, a young country\r\n  lad--Joseph Smith--and five other persons organized that movement\r\n  now known throughout Christendom as “The Church of Jesus Christ of\r\n  Latter-Day Saints,” or Mormonism. How the units have each increased\r\n  to tens of thousands, and where those disciples have been found,\r\n  and how they have been converted, is not the task I assign myself.\r\n  I _assisted_, as the Frenchmen say, at the thirty-first anniversary\r\n  Conference of that obscure movement, and propose to give the readers\r\n  of the “Republican” its picture, and “nothing extenuate nor set down\r\n  aught in malice.”\r\n\r\n  [THE MORMON CONFERENCE.]\r\n\r\n  Twice a year the Mormons assemble in Conference, on the 6th of\r\n  April and on the 6th of October, for the purpose of re-electing\r\n  their presiding authorities, or making such changes among them as\r\n  are deemed “wisdom” or “necessary”--the chiefs, also, making these\r\n  periods seasonable for general instruction to the “body”--and in\r\n  April electing and sending out missionaries to the nations of the\r\n  earth, where Mormonism is flourishing, or where the New Faith has yet\r\n  to be introduced.\r\n\r\n  As the settlements in the Territory are widely scattered, and\r\n  communication between them rare--except where business or family\r\n  purposes invite--the Conferences are looked forward to with peculiar\r\n  interest by the people generally as a time of renewing acquaintance\r\n  and friendship with those they have known and been associated with\r\n  in the Old World. To this add the curiosity to see and hear again\r\n  the “Prophet” and his associates, and the influences that draw the\r\n  multitude to Conference is comprehended.\r\n\r\n  Up to within a few years this country has, I am told,[169] been\r\n  rarely visited by showers of rain, the husbandmen depending almost\r\n  entirely upon the melting snows of the mountains for irrigating\r\n  fields and gardens. Very recently the snow and rain had fallen in\r\n  great abundance, and the muddy roads were rendered almost impassable.\r\n  Notwithstanding this obstacle, the faithful screwed up courage and\r\n  traveled in droves from every part of the Territory, and filled the\r\n  streets of the city during Conference like a county fair.\r\n\r\n  [169] The article is probably written by a Mormon elder. It is the\r\n  fashion, however, in newspaper correspondence--as the columns of the\r\n  “New York Herald” prove--to assume Gentilism for the nonce.\r\n\r\nEarly on Saturday morning the carriages and wagons, equestrians and\r\npedestrians, thronged into the city, and long before the opening of\r\nthe Tabernacle doors the people were gathering in groups, eager for\r\nadmission to obtain a good seat, fearing the general rush. On the\r\nSunday preceding, Brigham had requested the citizens here to stay at\r\nhome, and afford their country brethren and sisters an opportunity of\r\ngetting within the Tabernacle; otherwise there would have been a poor\r\nshow for the strangers, and as it was they were themselves vastly too\r\nmany for the dimensions of the building.\r\n\r\nTHE CONFERENCE--FIRST DAY--MORNING SESSION.\r\n\r\nAt 10 o’clock there were on the stand, according to technical rank and\r\nauthority:\r\n\r\nOf the First Presidency--Presidents Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball,\r\nand Daniel H. Wells.\r\n\r\nOf the Twelve Apostles--Orson Hyde, Willford Woodruff, John Taylor,\r\nGeorge A. Smith, Ezra T. Benson, Lorenzo Snow, and Franklin D. Richards.\r\n\r\nOf the First Presidency of the Seventies--Joseph Young, Levi W.\r\nHancock, Henry Herriman, Zera Pulsipher, Albert P. Rockwood, and Horace\r\nS. Eldredge.\r\n\r\nOf the Presidency of the High Priests--Edwin D. Woolley and Samuel W.\r\nRichards.\r\n\r\nOf the Presidency of the Stake--Daniel Spencer, David Fullmer, and\r\nGeorge B. Wallace.\r\n\r\nOf the Presidency of the Bishopric--Edward Hunter, Leonard W. Hardy,\r\nand Jesse C. Little.\r\n\r\nOf the Patriarchs--John Smith and Isaac Morley.\r\n\r\nApostle Hyde called the meeting to order, and in a moment all talking\r\nwas hushed, and a choir of about a dozen persons, accompanied by a\r\nfine-toned organ in the centre of the building, sung:\r\n\r\n    The morning breaks, the shadows flee,\r\n      Lo! Zion’s standard is unfurled!\r\n    The dawning of a brighter day\r\n      Majestic rises on the world.\r\n\r\n    The clouds of error disappear\r\n      Before the rays of truth divine;\r\n    The glory bursting from afar,\r\n      Wide o’er the nations soon will shine.\r\n\r\n    The Gentile fullness now comes in,\r\n      And Israel’s blessings are at hand;\r\n    Lo! Judah’s remnant, cleansed from sin,\r\n      Shall in their promised Canaan stand.\r\n\r\n    Jehovah speaks! let earth give ear,\r\n      And Gentile nations turn and live;\r\n    His mighty arm is making bare,\r\n      His cov’nant people to receive.\r\n\r\n    Angels from heaven and truth from earth\r\n      Have met, and both have record borne;\r\n    Thus Zion’s light is bursting forth,\r\n      To bring her ransomed children home.\r\n\r\nApostle Lorenzo Snow offered prayer, and the choir sung, “Praise ye the\r\nLord; ’tis good to praise.”\r\n\r\nApostle Benson was first invited to address the Conference. “Brother\r\nEzra” is generally called a son of thunder--great preacher, I suppose.\r\nOn this occasion he aimed at being modest, and after expressing his\r\ngratitude for the privilege of being permitted to attend Conference, to\r\ncome and see the Prophet, his counselors, and the twelve apostles, and\r\nthe good brothers and sisters, he was prepared to bear his testimony.\r\n\r\nHe knew that Joseph Smith was a prophet; that his predictions had been\r\nfulfilled, and were daily fulfilling, to the joy of all the Saints. He\r\nwould not stop there in his testimony; he would bear testimony to the\r\nteachings of President Brigham Young. His counselors--Heber C. Kimball\r\nand Daniel H. Wells--were also true as the revelations of Joseph, and\r\nhe rejoiced in them. Oh, what a joy it was to know that they had such\r\nmen to lead them! What would be the condemnation of those who rejected\r\ntheir testimony? Ezra was quite serious--yea, serious to shuddering.\r\n\r\nThe fearfulness of apostasy was eloquently portrayed. False spirits\r\nattending it, and false revelations bestowed on the backslider, and\r\nevery other ugly, disagreeable business was the certain lot of the\r\napostate, and from which the brethren were decently warned.\r\n\r\nPresident Daniel H. Wells was much pleased with the Latter-Day work; it\r\nwas a great blessing to live in the light of the Gospel. It had been\r\nbut a few years proclaimed to the world. The channel of communication\r\nbetween heaven and earth was again open to the children of men. Brother\r\nWells referred to the state of the nation. The present trouble was\r\nthe result of bad treatment to the Saints. The people of God had\r\nbeen driven into the wilderness--thousands might have perished, and\r\nthe government was indifferent. It was a political axiom, that when\r\ngovernments ceased to protect, the people were released from their\r\nobligations. The government had never protected the Saints as other\r\ncitizens. They had been driven from place to place, and the murderers\r\nof Joseph Smith had gone unpunished. Fault had been found with the\r\nMormons because they had asked the government to appoint good men as\r\nfederal officers--men in whom they had confidence. They were for this\r\ncalled rebels; but they were probably the only people that would yet\r\nstand by the Constitution and uphold it.\r\n\r\nThe government had fallen in the eyes of the civilized world; it\r\nhad become corrupt and debased. Nowadays nobody expected any thing\r\nfrom public servants but corruption. These things were well known to\r\nevery body. The Saints had been molested and could get no redress.\r\nThe Prophet Joseph, moved by the Spirit of the Most High, told their\r\nenemies there that they would see mobbing to their heart’s content, for\r\nthe measure that they meted to the Saints should be meted to them back\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe Saints could now see the distracted state of the nations, and the\r\nconfusion of all governments. If they were wise men and women, they\r\nwould appreciate the blessed inheritance that the Lord had brought\r\nthem to. He had but one request to make, and that was, that the people\r\nshould not only believe in the counselings of President Young, but be\r\ndiligent, and see that his counseling prospered.\r\n\r\nPresident Heber C. Kimball got up with the invocation of “God bless the\r\nSaints, and peace be multiplied unto them.” He respected and loved good\r\nmen and women who were striving to do the will of Heaven. The Mormons\r\nwere united, and he wanted them to continue so, and be of one heart\r\nand of one mind, and to do as they were told. The South had seceded\r\nfrom the North, but the Mormons would never secede from either. He had\r\nsometimes a kind of notion that North and South would secede from them,\r\nand if they did so the Mormons couldn’t help it, and the Lord would yet\r\nmake a great people of them, just as fast as they were able to bear it.\r\n\r\nHeber had a fling at “the miserable creatures who had been sent here\r\none time and another to rule and judge them.” The yoke was off their\r\nneck; they were away out from the confusion, and the yoke was on the\r\nneck of their enemies, and the bow-key was in. Many were engaged in\r\ntrying to have the Mormons associate with them in a national capacity;\r\nbut they would have nothing to do with them. “No, gentlemen and ladies,\r\nwe are free from them, and will keep free.” Heber was satisfied with\r\ntheir position in the mountains. Brigham was their governor; had always\r\nbeen so, and would always be so. He went around about with his hands\r\nin his pocket, and governed the people. They had the Lord for ruler,\r\nand the men whom he delegated could govern the people. He had no fear,\r\nfor he lived above the law; he transgressed no law, and had nothing to\r\napprehend. With an exhortation to go to and make themselves happy and\r\nindependent by their own industry, Heber’s racy discourse terminated\r\nwith a hearty _amen_ from the congregation.\r\n\r\nPresident Brigham Young was much pleased to meet with the Saints. The\r\nChurch was that day thirty-one years old--it seemed but a short time,\r\nyet a great work had been done. He remembered when he had a great\r\nanxiety to see some person of foreign birth embrace the faith. For the\r\nfirst few years it was only Americans who received it, but he could\r\nnow gaze upon tens of thousands from the nations of the Old World. He\r\ndiscarded miracles as being any evidence of the divinity of any man’s\r\nmission: men might be astonished by them, but the spirit only could\r\nconvince and satisfy the mind. Referred to Aaron’s operations: turning\r\nhis stick into a serpent, filling the air with life, and turning the\r\nrivers into blood, did not satisfy. He alluded to the troubles in the\r\nStates, and warned the people against too great anxiety; thought the\r\nnation was breaking up quite fast enough. All he was anxious about was\r\nthe Saints being prepared for every event in the providence of the\r\nLord. He sometimes wondered if the great men of the nation ever asked\r\nthemselves the question, “How can a republican government stand?” There\r\nwas but one way in which it could endure--as the government of heaven\r\nendures upon the basis of eternal truth and virtue. Had Martin Van\r\nBuren redressed the wrongs committed against the Saints--had he ordered\r\nthe State of Missouri to restore them to their property, the nation\r\nwould be stronger to-day than it is. He mourned to see the corruption,\r\nand he sometimes felt a blush for being an American. He had been reared\r\nby the green mountains of Vermont, and could look down upon the nation\r\nand mourn that he had no power to save it. Although he had no reason\r\nto doubt that President Lincoln was as good a man as ever sat in the\r\nchair of state, he had little hope of his accomplishing much. He was\r\npowerless, because of the corruptions that had been introduced and\r\nfostered by the chief men of the nation. “Abraham’s” authority and\r\npower was like a rope of sand: he was weak as water. The governments\r\nthat had been had put aside the innocent, justified thieving and every\r\nspecies of debauchery, and had fostered every one that plundered the\r\ncoffers of the people, and said let it be so.\r\n\r\nThe choir sung, “Arise, oh glorious Zion,” and with a benediction from\r\nPresident Joseph Young we got home for dinner.\r\n\r\nAFTERNOON SESSION.\r\n\r\nAt 2 P.M. the choir sung,\r\n\r\n    “Great God attend while Zion sings,”\r\n\r\nand Bishop Lorenzo D. Young prayed.\r\n\r\nThe choir sung,\r\n\r\n    “All hail the glorious day, by prophets long foretold.”\r\n\r\nAttention was requested from the congregation, and Apostle John\r\nTaylor was to put all the presiding authorities before the people for\r\nre-election. Twice a year, in April and October, all the presidents\r\nare presented and voted on separately, and such dismissals or changes\r\nmade that are deemed proper. On this occasion there were some additions\r\nmade, but not a dissentient voice heard. The present presiding\r\nauthorities in Mormondom are:\r\n\r\nBrigham Young as President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day\r\nSaints; Heber C. Kimball, his first, and Daniel H. Wells, his second\r\ncounselors.\r\n\r\nOrson Hyde as President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles; and Orson\r\nPratt, sen., Willford Woodruff, John Taylor, George A. Smith, Amasa\r\nLyman, Ezra T. Benson, Charles C. Rich, Lorenzo Snow, Erastus Snow,\r\nFranklin D. Richards, and George Q. Cannon, as members of the said\r\nQuorum.\r\n\r\nJohn Smith, Patriarch of the whole Church.\r\n\r\nDaniel Spencer as President of this Stake of Zion; and David Fullmer\r\nand George B. Wallace, his counselors.\r\n\r\nWilliam Eddington, James A. Little, John V. Long, John L. Blythe,\r\nGeorge Nebeker, John T. Caine, Joseph W. Young, Gilbert Clements,\r\nBrigham Young, jun., Franklin B. Woolley, Orson Pratt, jun., and Howard\r\nSpencer, as members of the High Council.\r\n\r\nJohn Young as President of the High Priests’ Quorum; Edwin D. Woolley\r\nand Samuel W. Richards, his counselors.\r\n\r\nJoseph Young, President of the first seven Presidents of the Seventies;\r\nand Levi W. Hancock, Henry Herriman, Zera Pulsipher, Albert P.\r\nRockwood, Horace S. Eldredge, and Jacob Gates, as members of the first\r\nseven Presidents of the Seventies.\r\n\r\nJohn Nebeker as President of the Elders’ Quorum; and Elnathan Eldredge\r\nand Joseph Felt, his counselors.\r\n\r\nEdward Hunter as Presiding Bishop; Leonard W. Hardy and Jesse C.\r\nLittle, his counselors.\r\n\r\nLewis Wight as President of the Priests’ Quorum; William Whiting and\r\nSamuel Moore, his counselors.\r\n\r\nM‘Gee Harris as President of the Teachers’ Quorum; Adam Speirs and\r\nDavid Bowman, his counselors.\r\n\r\nJohn S. Carpenter as President of the Deacon’s Quorum; William F. Cook\r\nand Warren Hardy, his counselors.\r\n\r\nBrigham Young was presented as Trustee in Trust for the Church of Jesus\r\nChrist of Latter-Day Saints.\r\n\r\nDaniel H. Wells as Superintendent of Public Works.\r\n\r\nTruman O. Angell, Architect for the Church.\r\n\r\nBrigham Young, President of the Perpetual Emigrating Fund to gather the\r\npoor.\r\n\r\nHeber C. Kimball, Daniel H. Wells, and Edward Hunter, his assistants\r\nand agents for said fund.\r\n\r\nGeorge A. Smith, Historian and general Church Recorder; and Willford\r\nWoodruff, his assistant.\r\n\r\nBesides the time consumed in putting every name separately for the\r\naction of the assembly, there was a good deal of instruction given\r\nabout the severities, which is of no outside interest.\r\n\r\nApostles John Taylor and George A. Smith, and Patriarch Assac Morley,\r\naddressed the audience.\r\n\r\nThe apostle Taylor thought the Mormons the freest people on the earth.\r\nThey could, if they would, reject their rulers twice a year: they had\r\nthe opportunity. The unity of the Saints pleased them. He questioned\r\n_Vox populi, vox Dei_. He got facetious, and wondered how they would\r\nget along, both North and South, with that doctrine. If the voice of\r\nthe people in the North was the voice of God, and the voice of the\r\npeople in the South was the voice of God, he was a little interested to\r\nknow with which of them he would really be. [_A Voice in the stand_:\r\n“Not either of them.”]\r\n\r\nWith the Saints it was _Vox Dei, vox populi_; the voice of God first,\r\nand the voice of the people afterward. The Spirit dictated and the\r\nSaints sustained it. But what were they after? Did they seek to subdue\r\nand put their feet on the necks of men? to rule and dictate nations?\r\nNo. It was only the “little stone cut out of the mountains,” growing\r\ninto the kingdom that the prophets foresaw that would be established\r\nin the last days. The Mormons had never troubled their neighbors, but\r\ntheir neighbors kept meddling with them. They had sent an army here,\r\nbut the Mormons did not seek to harm them when they had the chance.\r\nThey came here with the intention to kill the Mormons if they could;\r\nbut they couldn’t, for the Lord wouldn’t let them. Their enemies\r\nhad hunted them like wolves; but the Lord had said, “Touch not mine\r\nanointed, and do my prophets no harm.” They had kept the army out\r\nat Ham’s Fork shaking and shivering till they cooled down. “Brother\r\nTaylor” was real well pleased with things in general, and concluded\r\nwith Hallelujah.\r\n\r\nApostle George A. Smith was exceedingly humorous over the democracy.\r\nThere was no head to it; the centre of its intelligence was the belly,\r\nand the principal portion of the body was in the boots. Several\r\nplundering operations were alluded to, and Uncle Sam had been sadly\r\nvictimized by his boys. The government had been a miserable goose for\r\npoliticians to pluck. Abe Lincoln had now the honor of presiding over\r\na portion of what was once the United States; he had been elected by\r\nthe religious portion of the States. “George A.” remembered when the\r\nfolks of New York sold her slaves to Virginia. Their conscience would\r\nnot allow them to retain their fellow-beings in bondage--oh, they were\r\nmighty squeamish! They could take the money from Virginia, and as they\r\ngot more religion and more conscience they were exceedingly anxious for\r\nVirginia to set them loose!\r\n\r\nThat religious fanaticism that had been mixed up with politics would\r\nlead to bloodshed. They were more to be dreaded than infidels. They\r\nwere cruel in their fanaticism. The Republicans first whipped old\r\nBuck[170] into the Utah war, and they whipped him for getting into\r\nit, and whipped him awfully for getting out of it--he got out of it\r\ntoo soon. Politicians were in confusion, and the Lord would keep them\r\nthere. He labored to show the folly of men worshiping a God without\r\nbody, parts, or passions, for such being, if being he might be called,\r\nmust be destitute of principles and power. He argued that the God\r\nworshiped by sectarians could not be the being that wrestled with\r\nJacob, that conversed with Moses, and wrote with his finger upon tables\r\nof stone. He said that Joseph Smith had prophesied when the Saints were\r\ndriven from Jackson County, Missouri, that if the government did not\r\nredress our wrongs, they should have mob upon mob until mob power, and\r\nthat alone, should govern the whole land.\r\n\r\n  [170] Mr. Buchanan.\r\n\r\nHe bore testimony to the truth of the work in which he was engaged,\r\nand said if the Latter-Day Saints would listen to President Young’s\r\ninstructions as they ought to do, they would soon be the wealthiest\r\npeople upon the face of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe choir sung “The Standard of Zion.”\r\n\r\nAir--“_Star Spangled Banner._”\r\n\r\n    Oh see! on the tops of the mountains unfurled,\r\n      The ensign of promise, of hope, and salvation,\r\n    From their summits how nobly it waves to the world,\r\n      And spreads its broad folds o’er the good of each nation;\r\n    A signal of light for the lovers of right,\r\n    To rally where truth will soon triumph in might.\r\n      ’Tis the ensign of Israel streaming abroad,\r\n      And ever shall wave o’er the people of God.\r\n\r\n    By an angel’s strong hand to the earth it was brought\r\n      From the regions of glory, where long it lay folded;\r\n    And holy ones here, for the arduous work taught\r\n      By the priesthood unflinching and faithful uphold it;\r\n    Its crown pierces heav’n, and ’twill never be riv’n,\r\n    ’Till the rule of the earth will to Jesus be given.\r\n      For the ensign of Israel’s streaming abroad,\r\n      And ever shall wave o’er the people of God.\r\n\r\n    ’Tis the emblem of peace and good-will to mankind,\r\n      That prophets have sung of when freed by the spirit,\r\n    And a token which God has for Israel designed,\r\n      That their seed may the land of their fathers inherit;\r\n    Many nations will say, when they see its bright ray,\r\n    To the mountains of God let us hasten away;\r\n      For the ensign of Israel’s streaming abroad,\r\n      And ever shall wave o’er the people of God.\r\n\r\n    Its guardians are sending their ministers forth,\r\n      To tell when the Latter-Day kingdom is founded,\r\n    And invite all the lovers of truth on the earth,\r\n      Jew, Christian, and Gentile, to gather around it;\r\n    The cause will prevail, though all else may assail,\r\n    For God has decreed that his works shall not fail;\r\n      Oh! the ensign of Israel’s streaming abroad,\r\n      And ever shall wave o’er the people of God.\r\n\r\nPatriarch Morley pronounced the benediction, and the first day’s\r\nconference terminated.\r\n\r\nSECOND DAY.\r\n\r\nThe crowd on the Sunday far exceeded that of the preceding day. The\r\nstreets around the Temple Block were literally filled with people and\r\ncarriages. The Tabernacle could not hold a third of those who were\r\nanxious to hear. Every seat and standing-place was occupied long before\r\nthe opening of proceedings. As soon as Brigham reached the inside\r\nvestry, he sent out some of the apostles and elders to preach to the\r\noutsiders, sufficiently distant from the Tabernacle as not to disturb\r\neach other with their preaching.\r\n\r\nI have already filled so much paper that I fear trespassing too much\r\nupon your columns with the details of the second day at the present\r\ntime, as Brigham was very explicit on the subject of plurality of\r\nwives, and it was the only time I ever heard him on the “peculiar\r\ninstitution.”\r\n\r\nAltogether it was a great conference, and, as the foregoing exhibits,\r\nthe apostles enjoyed a particular free and easy time of it.\r\n\r\nIn its territorial status an anomaly has been forced upon the Mormon\r\npopulation. It must receive officers appointed and salaried by the\r\nfederal government, viz.:\r\n\r\n  A governor, with a salary of $2500 (£500) per annum, payable\r\n  quarterly.\r\n\r\n  A secretary to government, $1000.\r\n\r\n  A chief justice to the Supreme Court, $2500.\r\n  An associate        do.     do.       $1000.\r\n       Do.            do.     do.       $1000.\r\n\r\n  A district attorney, $400.\r\n\r\n  A marshal, $400 (not including perquisites).\r\n\r\n  A superintendent of Indian affairs, $2500.\r\n\r\n  A surveyor general, $2500.[171]\r\n\r\n  [171] The delegate to Washington receives “$8 per diem, not including\r\n  ‘mileage.’”\r\n\r\nThe governor, who is also commander-in-chief of the militia, holds\r\noffice for four years, unless sooner removed by the President of the\r\nUnited States, or until appointment of a successor. He has the usual\r\nright of pardoning territorial offenses, and of reprieving offenders\r\nagainst the federal government. He approves all laws passed by the\r\nLegislative Assembly before they can take effect; he commissions all\r\nofficers appointed under the laws, and takes care that the laws are\r\nfaithfully executed.\r\n\r\nThe secretary holds office for the same time: his duty is to record,\r\npreserve, and transmit copies of all laws and proceedings of the\r\nLegislative Assembly, and all acts and proceedings of the governor\r\nin his executive department. In case of death, removal, resignation,\r\nor necessary absence of the governor from the Territory, he acts\r\ntemporarily until the vacancy is filled up; and practically he looks\r\nforward to being a member of Congress in the House of Representatives\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nThe marshal holds office for a similar term: his duty is to execute\r\nall processes issued by the courts when exercising their functions\r\nas Circuit and District Courts of the United States. In disturbed\r\ncountries, as California of the olden time, the marshal’s principal\r\noffice seems to have been that of being shot at.\r\n\r\nThe executive arm would, in any other Territory, be found to work\r\neasily and well: it is, in fact, derived, with certain modifications,\r\nfrom that original Constitution which has ever remained to new states\r\nthe great old model. Among the Mormons, however, there is necessarily\r\na division and a clashing of the two principles: one, the federal,\r\nrepublican, and laical; the other, the theocratic, despotic, and\r\nspiritual. The former is the State, under which is the Church. The\r\nlatter is the Church, under which is the State, and hence complications\r\nwhich call for a cutting solution. As long as the Prophet and President\r\nwas also the temporal governor, so long the Mormons were contented: now\r\nthey must look forward to a change.\r\n\r\nThe Legislative Assembly consists of an “Upper House,” a President\r\nand Council of thirteen, and a House of Representatives, or Lower\r\nHouse, of twenty-six members, whose term of office is one year. An\r\nappointment of the representation based upon a census is made in the\r\nratio of population: the candidates, however, must be _bonâ fide_\r\nresidents of the counties or districts for which they stand. No member\r\nof the Legislative Assembly is allowed to hold any appointment created\r\nwhile he was in office, “or for one year thereafter,” and the United\r\nStates officials--post-masters alone excepted--can not become either\r\nsenators or representatives. The legislative power extends to the\r\nusual rightful and constitutional limits. “No law shall be passed\r\ninterfering with the primary disposal of the soil; no tax shall be\r\nimposed upon the property of the United States, nor shall the lands or\r\nother property of non-residents be taxed higher than the lands or other\r\nproperty of residents. All the laws passed by the Legislative Assembly\r\nand government shall be submitted to the Congress of the United States,\r\nand, if disapproved, shall be null and of no effect.”\r\n\r\n[VOTERS AND VOTING.--LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY.]\r\n\r\nEvery free male (white) inhabitant[172] above the age of twenty-one,\r\nwho has resided in the county for sixty days before the election, is\r\nentitled to vote, and is eligible for office; the right is limited to\r\ncitizens of the United States, including those recognized by treaty\r\nwith the Mexican Republic (2d of Feb., 1848), and excluding, as usual,\r\nthe military servants of the federal government. Great fault was found\r\nby anti-Mormons with the following permissions in the act regulating\r\nelections (Jan., 1853), because they artistically enough abolish the\r\nballot while they retain the vote.[173]\r\n\r\n  [172] When the vexed passage, “We hold these truths to be\r\n  self-evident, that all men are created equal,” written in 1776, is\r\n  interpreted in 1860, it must be read, “all (free white) men” to be\r\n  consistent and intelligible. Similarly “persons bound to labor”\r\n  must be considered a euphuism for slaves. The “American Mirabeau,”\r\n  Jefferson, who framed the celebrated Declaration, certainly did not\r\n  consider, as the context of his life proves, slaves to be his equals.\r\n  What he intended the Mormons have expressed.\r\n\r\n  Again, what can be clearer than that the Constitution contemplated\r\n  secession? If an adult citizen is allowed to throw off his\r\n  allegiance, surely the body of citizens called a state have, _à\r\n  majori_, a right to withdraw from a “federal union.”\r\n\r\n  [173] The first Legislative Assembly was elected in the summer of\r\n  1851, and held a session in the following autumn and winter. An\r\n  historian’s office was established, courts were organized, cities\r\n  incorporated, and a small body of Territorial laws were passed. The\r\n  second Legislative Assembly met on the 15th of January, 1852, at the\r\n  Council House, and after the organization of the two houses, they\r\n  came together to receive the message of the governor, Mr. Brigham\r\n  Young. The archon, when notified of the hour, entered, sat down in\r\n  the speaker’s chair, and on being asked if he had any communication\r\n  to make, handed his message to the President of the Council, who\r\n  passed it for reading to the Clerk of the House. The message was\r\n  a lengthy and creditable document; of course, it was severely\r\n  criticised, but the gravamen of the charges was the invidious phrase\r\n  used by the Prophet to his lieges, “for your guidance.”\r\n\r\n  Sec. 5. Each elector shall provide himself with a vote, containing\r\n  the names of the persons he wishes elected, and the offices he would\r\n  have them to fill, and present it neatly folded (!) to the judge of\r\n  the elections, who shall number and deposit it in the ballot-box; the\r\n  clerk shall then write the name of the elector, and opposite it the\r\n  number of his vote.\r\n\r\n  Sec. 6. At the close of the election the judge shall seal up the\r\n  ballot-box, and the list of the names of the electors, and transmit\r\n  the same without delay to the county clerks.\r\n\r\n“In a Territory so governed,” remarks Mr. Secretary Ferris, “it will\r\nnot excite surprise that cases of extortion, robbery, murder, and other\r\ncrimes should occur, and defy all legal redress, or that the law should\r\nbe made the instrument of crime.”\r\n\r\nThe deduction is unfair. The real cause why crime goes unpunished must,\r\nas will presently appear, be sought in an unfriendly and conflicting\r\njudiciary. The act itself can produce nothing but good; it enables the\r\nwise few to superintend the actions of the unwise many, and it subjects\r\nthe “tyrant majority,” as ever should be the case, to the will of the\r\nfavored minority. As the Conqueror of Sindh often said, “When noses are\r\ncounted, the many are those without brains.”\r\n\r\nThe bad working of a divided executive is as nothing compared with\r\nthe troubles occasioned by the opposition judiciaries, federal and\r\nterritorial.\r\n\r\nAn act (19th of Jan., 1855) provides that a Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates be held annually on the first Monday in January, at Fillmore\r\nCity; each session to be kept open at least one day, and no session to\r\nbe legal except on adjournment in the regular term. Another act (4th\r\nof Feb., 1852) directed that the District Courts, now three in number,\r\nshall exercise original jurisdiction both in civil and criminal cases\r\nwhen not otherwise provided by law, and also have a general supervision\r\nover all inferior courts, to prevent and correct abuses where no other\r\nremedy is provided. The above are officered by the federal government.\r\n\r\nSection 23d of the same act provides for a Judge of Probate--of course\r\na Mormon--_elected by the joint vote of the Legislative Assembly and\r\ncommissioned by the governor_. His tenure of office is four years,\r\nand he holds regular sessions on the second Mondays of March, June,\r\nSeptember, and December of each year. The Probate Court, besides the\r\nduties which its name suggests, has the administration of estates, and\r\nthe guardianship of minors, idiots, and insane persons; with these\r\nits proper offices, however, it combines power to _exercise original\r\njurisdiction, both civil and criminal_, regulated only by appeal under\r\ncertain conditions to the District Courts. Of late the anomaly has\r\nbeen acknowledged by the Supreme Court.[174] Inferior to the Probate\r\nCourt, and subject to its revision, are the Justices of the Peace,\r\nthe Municipal Court, and the three selectmen in each organized\r\ncounty. Besides the Probate Courts, the Mormons have instituted, as\r\nwill presently appear, Ecclesiastical High Council under the Church\r\nauthorities and the President, provided with ample powers of civil and\r\ncriminal jurisdiction, and fully capable of judging between Saint and\r\nSaint.\r\n\r\n  [174] The Court held, First. That the 9th section of the Organic\r\n  Act vested all judicial power in the Supreme, District, and Probate\r\n  Courts, and in Justices of the Peace.\r\n\r\n  Second. That the only restriction placed upon these courts was as to\r\n  Justices of the Peace, refusing them jurisdiction to try any case\r\n  involving the title or boundary to land, or any suit where the claim\r\n  or demand exceeded one hundred dollars.\r\n\r\n  Third. That by virtue of that clause of the Organic Act which\r\n  provides that “the jurisdiction of the several courts therein\r\n  provided for,” including the Probate Courts, “_shall be as limited by\r\n  law_,” that the Legislature had the right to provide by law for the\r\n  exercise by the Probate Courts of jurisdiction in civil and criminal\r\n  cases.\r\n\r\n  Fourth. That as the Organic Act conferred common law and chancery\r\n  jurisdiction upon the Supreme and District Courts respectively, that\r\n  this jurisdiction belonged to these courts exclusively, and that\r\n  the Probate Courts were confined to the jurisdiction conferred by\r\n  statute, and such jurisdiction might be exercised concurrently with\r\n  the District Courts to the extent provided by statute.\r\n\r\n  Fifth. That as the Legislature had passed a law conferring upon the\r\n  Probate Courts concurrent jurisdiction with the District Courts to\r\n  hear and determine civil as well as criminal cases within their\r\n  respective counties, and had provided the manner in which this\r\n  jurisdiction should be exercised, that the trial, conviction, and\r\n  sentence of the prisoner were valid and binding in law until reversed\r\n  by an appellate court.\r\n\r\n  Although Judge Shaver, one of the best of jurists, tacitly\r\n  acknowledged the jurisdiction of Probate Courts, Judge Kinney is the\r\n  first who has dared assert his decision judicially.\r\n\r\n[CONFLICTING JUDICIARIES.]\r\n\r\nIn describing the operations of the two conflicting judiciaries, I\r\nshall borrow the words of both parties.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Mormons, the increased chicanery of the federal\r\ngovernment has arrived at full development in their Territory.[175] The\r\nphrase has been, “Any thing is good enough for Utah.” The salary is too\r\ninconsiderable to satisfy any but the worst kind of jack-in-office, and\r\nthe object of those appointed is to secure notoriety in the Eastern\r\nStates by obstructing justice, and by fomenting disturbances in the\r\nWest. The three judges first appointed from Washington in June, 1851,\r\nbecame so unpopular, that in the autumn of the same year they were\r\nobliged to leave Utah Territory--one of them with a “flea in his ear”\r\nduly inserted by Mr. Brigham Young. I shall not quote names, nor will\r\nthe reader require them. Another attempted to break the amnesty in\r\n1858, and when asked for suggestions by the Legislative Assembly,\r\nproposed an act for the prevention and punishment of polygamy, and\r\nurged the Senate to divide the land between the proposed Territories;\r\nfinally, this excellent Christian hung a Gentile brother on the Lord’s\r\nday. Another killed himself with opium; another was a notorious\r\ndrunkard; and another was addicted to gambling in his cellar. A judge\r\ndisgraced himself with an Indian squaw, who entered his court, and,\r\n_coram publico_, demanded her honorarium, and another seated on the\r\nbench his mistress--_la maîgre Ada_, as she is termed by M. Remy, the\r\nGentile traveler--and the Mormons have not yet learned to endure Alice\r\nPeirce, or to worship the Goddess of Reason in that shape. Another\r\nattempted to convict Mr. Brigham Young of forgery. The marshal was, in\r\none case, a _ci-devant_ teamster, who could hardly write his own name.\r\nBesides the vileness of their characters, their cliqueism and violent\r\nhostility have led to prostitution of justice; a Mormon _accusé_ was\r\ninvariably found guilty by them, a Gentile was invariably acquitted.\r\nThus the Probate Courts, properly jurisdictors of the dead, were made\r\njudges of the living in all civil and criminal cases, because justice\r\nwas not obtainable from the Supreme District and the Circuit judges\r\nappointed by the federal government. To the envenomed reports of these\r\nofficials the Saints attribute all the disturbances in 1857-58, and\r\nsundry high-handed violations of the constitutional liberties and\r\nthe dearest rights of American citizenship. For instance, the Indian\r\nwar of 1852 cost them $200,000; they repeatedly memorialized Congress\r\nto defray, strictly according to precedent, these expenditures, and\r\nyet, from 1850 to 1855, they have received, in payment of expenses and\r\ntreaties, grants and presents, only the sum of $95,940. Though Utah\r\nTerritory has practiced far more economy than Oregon or California,\r\nthe drafts forwarded by the Superintendent of Indian Affairs to the\r\nTreasury at Washington are totally neglected, or are subjected to\r\ndelays and frivolous annoyances. The usual treaties with the Indians\r\nhave not been held by the federal government. The Mormons’ requisition\r\nfor becoming a state is systematically ignored, and this ignoble\r\nminorhood is prolonged, although they can show five head of souls for\r\nthree possessed by California at the time of her admittance--another\r\ninstance of a “rancorous persecuting spirit, excited by false and\r\nmalicious representations.” He who lifteth up an ensign on the\r\nmountains is now “about to destroy a certain nation under the name of\r\nthe sour grape (Catawba?);” and the Mormons see in the present civil\r\nwar at once retribution for their injuries, and the fulfillment of the\r\ndenunciations of Joseph the Seer against the “Gentile land of strife\r\nand wickedness.” Assuredly Fate has played marvelously into their hands.\r\n\r\n  [175] The Utah correspondent of the “New York Herald,” writing from\r\n  Salt Lake under date of April 26th, states that the fall of Fort\r\n  Sumter and the secession of Virginia had created intense interest\r\n  among the “Saints.” The news was read in the Tabernacle by Brigham\r\n  Young, and the disciples were asked to believe that this was merely\r\n  the prediction of Mr. Joseph Smith about the breaking up of the\r\n  American Union.\r\n\r\nThe federal officials retort with a counter charge against the Saints\r\nof systematically obstructing the course of justice. A Mormon must be\r\ntried by his peers; however guilty, he will be surely acquitted, as\r\na murdering fugitive slave in the North, or a thievish filibuster in\r\nthe South; that it is vain to attempt jurisdiction over a people who\r\nhave an ecclesiastical Star-Chamber and Vigilance Committee working\r\nout in darkness a sectarian law; that no civilized government could or\r\nwould admit into a community of Christian states a power founded on\r\nprophethood and polygamy, a theodemocracy, with a Grand Lama presiding\r\nover universal suffragators; that all accusations of private immorality\r\nproceed from a systematic attack upon the federal Union through its\r\nofficers; and, finally, that, so thin-skinned is Mormon sensibility, a\r\ntorrent of vituperation follows the least delay made with respect to\r\ntheir “ridiculous pretensions.”\r\n\r\nThe author speaks. Of course there are faults on both sides, and each\r\nparty has nothing better to do than to spy out the other’s sins of\r\nomission and commission. The Americans (_i. e._, anti-Mormons), never\r\nvery genial or unprejudiced, are not conciliatory; they rage violently\r\nwhen called Gentiles, and their “respectability,” a master-passion in\r\nColumbian lands, is outraged, maiden-modesty-like, by the bare mention\r\nof polygamy. On the other hand, the Latter-Day Saints, who now flourish\r\nin the Mountain Territory, and who expect eventually to flourish over\r\nthe whole earth, “are naturally prepared to hate and denigrate all\r\nbeyond the pale of their own faith.” If the newly-arrived judge fails,\r\nwithin the first week, to wait upon Mr. President, he or his may expect\r\nto be the subject of an offensive newspaper article. If another live\r\namong his co-religionists at Camp Floyd, he is convicted of cliqueism,\r\nand is forthwith condemned as a foe. Whatever proceeds from the federal\r\ngovernment is and must be distasteful to them; to every address they\r\nreply, “To your tents, O Israel!” “Their nobles shall be of themselves,\r\nand their governor shall proceed from the midst of them,” is the\r\nshaft which they level against the other party, and which recoils\r\nupon themselves. The result is that if the territorial judiciary\r\nsentences a criminal, he appeals to the federals, and at once obtains\r\ncassation--and _vice versâ_. The usual procedure in criminal cases is\r\nto make oath before a magistrate, who thereupon commands the marshal\r\nto take the accused into custody, and “them safely keep,” so that\r\nhe may produce their bodies before the first sessions of the United\r\nStates District Courts; if the magistrate be a Mormon, he naturally\r\nrefuses to prosecute and persecute a brother Saint--and _vice versâ_.\r\nThus many notorious offenders, whom the Mormons would, for their own\r\nsakes, willingly see cut off from the congregation--in simple words,\r\nhung--escape with impunity after the first excitement has settled down:\r\nthe most terrible crimes are soon forgotten in the party fight, and in\r\nthe race to “go ahead;” after five years they become pabulum for the\r\nlocal antiquary.\r\n\r\nI have thus attempted, with feeble hand, to divide the blame between\r\nboth the great contending parties, and may fairly, I hope, expect to be\r\nunanimously rejected by both.\r\n\r\n[CORPORATION OF GREAT SALT LAKE CITY.]\r\n\r\nThe ordinance to incorporate Great Salt Lake City was approved by the\r\nGeneral Assembly of the State of Deserét on the 19th of January, 1851,\r\nand the body municipal was constituted, like Fillmore, Ogden, and other\r\ncities in the Territory. The City Council consists of a mayor, four\r\naldermen, and one common councilor per ward--formerly there were but\r\nnine; they are elected by votes, with the usual qualifications; are\r\nsworn or affianced to support the federal and territorial Constitution,\r\nand retain office for two years. They collect the taxes, which,\r\nhowever, must not exceed 1·50 per cent. per annum upon the assessed\r\nvalue of all taxable property, real and personal.[176] They appoint\r\ntheir recorder, treasurer, assessor, collector, marshal, and supervisor\r\nof streets, and have sole charge of the police. They establish and\r\nsupport schools and hospitals, regulate “hacking,” “tippling houses,”\r\nand gambling and billiard-tables; inspect lumber, hay, bread and\r\nprovisions, and provide against fires--which here, contrary to the\r\nrule throughout England and the Eastern States, are rare and little to\r\nbe feared; direct night-lighting and the storage of combustibles, and\r\nregulate streets, bridges, and fences. They have power to enforce their\r\nordinances by fines and penalties. Appeals from the decisions of the\r\nmayor and aldermen are made to the Municipal Court, composed of the\r\nmayor as chief justice, and the aldermen as associate justices, and\r\nfrom the Municipal Court to the Probate Court of Great Salt Lake City.\r\n\r\n  [176] The property-tax, like tithes, forming the Church funds and the\r\n  revenue of the civil government, are general; the octroi ($20 for 100\r\n  lbs. of every thing entering the Territory from the east, and $25\r\n  from the west) and water-tax are local, and confined to towns. I can\r\n  not find any other recognized imposts. The anti-Mormons declare that\r\n  the Saints are overburdened with taxation. The Saints assert that\r\n  their burden is light, especially when compared with the Mormons’\r\n  taxation of the Atlantic cities, which averages from double to treble\r\n  that of London and Paris--a little drawback to Liberty when she must\r\n  be bought for her weight in gold.\r\n\r\n  In the Auditor’s report accompanying the Governor’s Message of 1860,\r\n  there are some items of general interest to people outside, as well\r\n  as to those in the Territory. The report states that “the total\r\n  valuation of property assessed in the Territory for the year 1860\r\n  (Green River and Carson counties excepted) amounts to $4,673,900.”\r\n  Assessors in Utah are, I presume, like assessors every where, not\r\n  likely to obtain an exaggerated estimate of the value of property,\r\n  as on that estimate assessments are made. Property, therefore, may\r\n  be set down at a much larger figure than that given in the above\r\n  extract. The Territorial tax at one half of one per cent. is .3,369\r\n  50. As an evidence of the increase of population and of improvement\r\n  in property, the excess of Territorial tax is over that of last year\r\n  $13,278 33--five sixths of which is collected in Great Salt Lake\r\n  County, and that chiefly in this city. Of the other counties, the\r\n  report states, “The counties of Weber, Box-Elder, and Juab each show\r\n  a decrease in the valuation of property, compared with the assessment\r\n  for 1859, of 16 per cent., and Iron County a decrease of 33 per\r\n  cent., while the counties of Beaver, San Pete, and Cache show a more\r\n  than corresponding increase in the following ratio, viz.: Beaver,\r\n  36; San Pete, 50; and Cache, 900 per cent. The increase in the three\r\n  last-named counties, especially Cache, may account in some measure\r\n  for the decrease in the other counties named, from the fact that,\r\n  during the fall of 1859 and the spring of 1860, very many wealthy\r\n  families moved with their stock and effects to form new settlements\r\n  in Cache and San Pete counties, and probably the same may be said of\r\n  Beaver.”\r\n\r\n  The tax of all the counties amounts to .3,369 50; the totals of\r\n  auditor’s awards issued $19,184 88, which, together with $5450 95\r\n  payable on appropriations heretofore made, shows that the Mormons\r\n  have the good sense to keep clear of a Territorial debt.\r\n\r\n[INDUSTRY OF GREAT SALT LAKE CITY.]\r\n\r\nIn the young settlements of the Far West there is a regular\r\nself-enforced programme of manufacturing progress. The first step is to\r\nestablish flouring or grist mills, and lumber or saw mills, to provide\r\nfor food and shelter. After these _sine quâ nons_ come the comforts\r\nof cotton-spinning, wool-carding, cloth-weaving, tailoring, and\r\nshoemaking. Lastly arise the luxuries of life, which penetrate slowly\r\ninto this Territory on account of the delay and expense of transporting\r\nheavy machinery across the “wild desert plains.” The minor mechanical\r\ncontrivances, the remarkable inventions of the Eastern States--results\r\nof a necessity which removes every limit to human ingenuity--such as\r\nsewing-machines, cataract washing-machines, stump-extracting machines,\r\nand others, which, but for want of hands, would never have been dreamed\r\nof, are not unknown at Great Salt Lake City.\r\n\r\nThe subjoined extract from the list of premiums of the Deserét\r\nAgricultural Society[177] will explain the industry at Great Salt Lake\r\nCity in 1860--will prove that the infant colony has supplied all its\r\nactual wants, and will show what energy and perseverance can effect\r\nagainst time and all manner of obstructions. Besides the industries\r\nmentioned below, there are stores, cutlery shops, watch-makers and\r\njewelers, painters and glaziers, brush-makers, cabinet-makers, and\r\nskillful turners--for the most part English. Iron and brass founderies\r\nare in contemplation, and a paper-mill is coming across the prairies.\r\nThe cutlery is good, the swords, spears, and Congress knives, the\r\npruning-hooks, saws, and locks are yearly improving, and the imitations\r\nof Colt’s revolvers can hardly be distinguished from the originals.\r\nThe distilleries, of course, can not expect prizes. The whisky of Utah\r\nTerritory, unlike the Monongahela or rye of Pennsylvania, and the\r\nBourbon, or maize brandy of Kentucky, is distilled from wheat only;\r\nit is, in fact, the korn schnapps of the trans-Rhenine region. This\r\n“Valley Tan,” being generally pure, is better than the alcohol one\r\npart and water one part, colored with burnt sugar and flavored with\r\ngreen tea, which is sold under the name of Cognac. Ale and cakes are in\r\nhigher flavor than the “villainous distillation:” there are two large\r\nand eight small breweries in which a palatable Lager-bier is made. The\r\nhop grows wild and luxuriant in every kanyon; and there is no reason\r\nwhy in time the John Barleycorn of the Saints should not rival that of\r\nthe sinners in lands where no unfriendly legislation tries, or will, it\r\nis hoped, ever try,\r\n\r\n    “To rob a poor man of his beer.”\r\n\r\n  [177] The act incorporating the society, which was established\r\n  “with a view of promoting the arts of domestic industry, and to\r\n  encourage the production of articles from the native elements in this\r\n  Territory,” was approved on January 17, 1856.

Excellent blankets, the finest linens, and embroidered\r\nbuckskin garments, varying in prices from $75 to $500--a splendid\r\nspecimen was, at the time of my stay, being worked for that “Champion\r\nof oppressed nationalities,” M. Louis Kossuth--are the results.\r\n\r\n[PRICES AT GREAT SALT LAKE CITY.]\r\n\r\nAs in India, the mere necessaries of life at Great Salt Lake City are\r\ncheap: the foreign luxuries, and even comforts, are exorbitantly dear.\r\nA family may live almost for nothing upon vegetables grown in their\r\nown garden, milk from their own cows, wheaten bread, and butter which\r\nderives a peculiar sweetness from the bunch-grass. For some reason,\r\nwhich no one can explain, there is not, and there never has been, a\r\nmarket at Great Salt Lake City; consequently, even meat is expensive.\r\nFreight upon every article, from a bar of soap to a bar of iron, must\r\nbe reckoned at 14 cents (7_d._) per lb. coming from the East, and\r\n25-30 cents from the West. Groceries and clothing are inordinately\r\nhigh-priced. Sugar, worth 6 cents in the United States, here fetches\r\nfrom 37¹⁄₂ to 45 cents per lb. Tea is seldom drunk, and as coffee of\r\n10 cents per lb. in the States here costs 40-50 cents, burnt beans\r\nor toasted corn, a caricature of chicory, is the usual succedaneum.\r\nCounterblasters will be pleased to hear that tobacco fetches $1 per\r\nlb., and cigars from 5 to 6 cents each--a London price. Servants’ wages\r\nvary from $30 to $40 per mensem--nearly £100 per annum; consequently,\r\nmaster has a strong inducement to marry the “missus’s” Abigail. Thus\r\nthe expense of living in Utah Territory is higher than in the Eastern\r\nStates, where again it exceeds that of England. In Great Salt Lake\r\nCity $10,000 (= £2000) per annum would be equal to about £500 in\r\nLondon. Fortunately for the poor, the excessive purity of the air, as\r\nin the Arabian Desert, enables them to dispense with, and not to miss,\r\nmany articles, such as stimulants, which are elsewhere considered\r\nnecessaries. The subjoined “nerrick” of prices current at the General\r\nTithing Office in Great Salt Lake City will best explain the state of\r\nthings in 1860. A remarkable feature, it will be observed, is the price\r\nof wheat--$1 50 per bushel--more than double its current value in the\r\nMississippian States.[178]\r\n\r\n  [178] General Tithing Office Prices Current, Great Salt Lake City:\r\n\r\n  Wheat, extra produce tithing              $1 50    ⅌ bush.\r\n  Wheat, labor and produce tithing           2 00       „\r\n  Barley                                     1 50       „\r\n  Corn                                       1 50       „\r\n  Rye                                        1 50       „\r\n  Oats                                       1 00       „\r\n  Buckwheat                                  1 25       „\r\n  Peas and beans                             2 00       „\r\n  Potatoes                                   0 75       „\r\n  Beets                                      0 50       „\r\n  Carrots                                    0 50       „\r\n  Parsnips                                   0 50       „\r\n  Onions                                     2 00       „\r\n  Turnips                                    0 25       „\r\n  Tomatoes                                   1 00       „\r\n  Cabbages                       $0 02      @0 10    each.\r\n  Pumpkins and squash             0 02      @0 08      „\r\n  Melons                          0 02      @0 10      „\r\n  Cucumbers                                  0 01      „\r\n  Pigs, four weeks old                       3 00      „\r\n  Chickens                        0 10      @0 25      „\r\n  Ducks                           0 15      @0 25      „\r\n  Beef, 6¹⁄₂ average.\r\n  Hind quarter                               0 07    ⅌ ℔\r\n  Fore quarter                               0 06      „\r\n  Tallow                          0 10      @0 20      „\r\n  Pork                            0 12¹⁄₂   @0 20      „\r\n  Lard                            0 15      @0 20      „\r\n  Mutton                          0 08      @0 12¹⁄₂   ℔.\r\n  Veal                            0 03      @0 05      „\r\n  Bear                            0 08      @0 12¹⁄₂   „\r\n  Tea                             1 50      @3 50      „\r\n  Coffee                          0 40      @0 60      „\r\n  Sugar                           0 35      @0 60      „\r\n  Milk                                       0 10    ⅌ qt.\r\n  Eggs                                       0 18    ⅌ doz.\r\n  Butter                                     0 25    ⅌ ℔.\r\n  Cheese                          0 12¹⁄₂   @0 25       „\r\n  Salt, fine                                 0 04      „\r\n  Salt, coarse                               0 10      „\r\n  Cast steel, warranted           0 37¹⁄₂   @0 50      „\r\n  Spring steel                               0 37¹⁄₂   „\r\n  Blister steel                   0 18      @0 30      „\r\n  Iron                                       0 10      „\r\n  Molasses, good                             3 00    ⅌ gall.\r\n  Vinegar                         0 50      @0 75       „\r\n  Lumber, extra produce tithing              4 00    ⅌ 100.\r\n  Lumber, labor tithing                      5 00       „\r\n  Shingles, best                            10 00    ⅌ 1000.\r\n  Shingles, 2d quality                       8 00       „\r\n  Shingles, cotton-wood                      8 00       „\r\n  Shingles, 2d quality                       6 00       „\r\n  Doves                                      0 12¹⁄₂ each.\r\n  Turkeys                         1 50      @2 50      „\r\n  Fox and wolf skins                         0 75      „\r\n  Ox hair                                    0 50    ⅌ bush.\r\n\r\n  EDWARD HUNTER, Presiding Bishop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DEAD SEA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nThird Week at Great Salt Lake City.--Excursions.\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernor Cumming had asked me to accompany Madam and himself to the\r\nshores of the lake, with an ulterior view to bathing and picnicking.\r\n\r\nOne fine morning, at 10 A.M., duly provided with the _nécessaire_\r\nand a thermometer--which duly snapped in two before immersion--we\r\nset out down the west road, crossed the rickety two-laned bridge\r\nthat spans the holy stream, and debouched upon a mirage-haunted and\r\nsingularly ugly plain. Wherever below the line of debordement of the\r\nlake’s spring freshet, it is a mere desert; where raised, however,\r\nthe land is cultivable, from the Wasach Mountains to Spring Point, at\r\nthe north of the Oquirrh, giving about eighty square miles of fertile\r\nland. The soil, as near the lake generally, is a thin layer of saline\r\nhumus, overspreading gravel and pebbles. The vegetation is scattered\r\nartemisia, rose-bushes, the _Euphorbia tuberosa_ and other varieties of\r\nmilk-weed, the greasewood, salicornias, and several salsolaceæ. There\r\nare numerous salt deposits, all wet and miry in the rainy season; and\r\nthe animals that meet the sight are the coyote, the badger, and the\r\nhideous Phrynosoma. A few blue cranes and sage-chickens, which are\r\neatable till October, were seen; and during winter the wild-fowl are\r\nfound in large flocks, and the sweet-water streams are stocked with\r\ndiminutive fish. In contrast with the bald and shaven aspect of the\r\nplain, rose behind us the massive forms of the Wasach Mountains, robed\r\nin forests, mist-crowned, and showing a single streak of white, which\r\nentitles them to the poetical boast of eternal snow--snow apparently\r\nnever being respectable without eternity.\r\n\r\nAfter fifteen miles of good road we came to the Point o’ the\r\nMountain--the head of the Oquirrh, also called West Mountain--where\r\npyramidal buttes bound the southern extremity of the lake. Their\r\nhorizontal lines are cleanly cut by the action of water, and fall in\r\nsteps toward the plain. Any appearance of regularity in the works of\r\nNature is always pleasing--firstly, because it contrasts with her\r\ninfinite diversity; and, secondly, because it displays her grandeur\r\nby suggesting comparison with the minor works of mankind. Ranches\r\nand corrals, grass and cattle, now began to appear, and the entrance\r\nof a large cave was pointed out to me in the base of the buttes. We\r\ndrove on, and presently emerged upon the shores of this “dead and\r\ndesert”--this “still and solitary” sea. It has not antiquity enough\r\nto have become the scene of fabulous history; the early Canadian\r\n_voyageurs_, however, did their best to ennoble it, and recounted to\r\nwondering strangers its fearful submarine noises, its dark and sudden\r\nstorms, and the terrible maelstrom in its centre, which, funnel-like,\r\ndescended into the bowels of the earth. I believe that age is its\r\nonly want; with _quasi_-lifeless waters, a balance of evaporation and\r\nsupply--ever a mystery to the ignorant--and a horned frog, the Dead Sea\r\nof the New World has claims to preternaturalism at least equal to those\r\nof its sister feature, the volcano of depression, in the Old Hemisphere.\r\n\r\n[MARE MORTUUM.]\r\n\r\nThe first aspect of Mare Mortuum was by no means unprepossessing. As we\r\nstood upon the ledge, at whose foot lies the selvage of sand and salt\r\nthat bounds the wave, we seemed to look upon the sea of the Cyclades.\r\nThe sky was light and clear, the water of a deep lapis-lazuli blue,\r\nflecked here and there with the smallest of white horses--tiny billows,\r\nurged by the warm soft wind; and the feeble tumble of the surf upon\r\nthe miniature sands reminded me, with the first surveyor, “of scenes\r\nfar, far away, where mightier billows pay their ceaseless tribute\r\nto the strand.” In front of us, and bounding the extreme northwest,\r\nlay Antelope or Church Island, rising in a bold central ridge. This\r\nrock forms the western horizon to those looking from the city, and\r\nits delicate pink--the effect of a ruddy carpet woven with myriads of\r\nsmall flowers--blushing in the light of the setting sun, is ever an\r\ninteresting and beautiful object. Nearer, it has a brown garb, almost\r\nwithout a tinge of green, except in rare, scattered spots; its benches,\r\nbroken by gashes and gullies, rocks and ravines, are counterparts to\r\nthose on the main land; and its form and tintage, softened by the\r\ndamp overhanging air, and contrasting with the light blue sky and\r\nthe dark ultramarine streak of sea at its base, add greatly to the\r\npicturesqueness of the view. The foreground is a strip of sand, yellow\r\nwhere it can be seen, incrusted with flakes of salt like the icing of a\r\nplum-cake, and bearing marks of submergence in the season of the spring\r\nfreshets. At the water’s edge is a broken black line of a peculiar\r\ndrift, which stands boldly out from the snowy whiteness around. Where\r\nmy sketch was taken I looked as through a doorway, whose staples were\r\ntwo detached masses of stone. On the right rose an irregular heap of\r\nconglomerate and sandstone, attached to the ledge behind, and leaning\r\nforward as if about to fall. On the left, the “Black Rock,” which can\r\nbe seen as a dot from the city, a heap of flint conglomerate, imbedded\r\nin slaty, burnt, and altered clay, formed the terminating bluff to a\r\nneck of light sand and dark stone.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to our picnic, I will briefly resume the history and\r\ngeography of this Mare Mortuum. The Baron de la Hontan, the French\r\ngovernor of Placentia, in Newfoundland, about 1690, heard from Indians\r\nof a Great Salt Water, which he caused to disembogue through a huge\r\nriver into the South Sea or Pacific Ocean. Like the Lake Tanganyika,\r\nin Central Africa, it was arrayed in the garb of fable, 300 leagues of\r\nlength, 30 of breadth, with “100 towns about it,” like Mr. Cooley’s\r\nhighly imaginative “Zanganica,” and navigated in large boats by the\r\nsavage Mozeemleks, who much remind one of the old semi-mythical\r\n“Mono-moezi.” Doubtless many a trapper and obscure trader has since\r\nthat time visited it; a name or two has been found upon the adjacent\r\nrocks, but those were braves who, to speak metaphorically, lived before\r\nthe age of Agamemnon. In 1845, Colonel Frémont, then engaged with his\r\nsecond expedition, made a partial flying survey, which, in 1849-50, was\r\nscientifically completed by Captain Howard Stansbury.\r\n\r\nIn geologic ages the lake occupied the space between the Sierra Madre\r\non the east, and the ranges of Goose Creek and Humboldt River on the\r\nwest. The length is roughly computed at 500 miles from north to south,\r\nthe breadth from 350 to 500, and the area at 175,000 square miles. The\r\nwaters have declined into the lowest part of the basin by the gradual\r\nupheaval of the land, in places showing thirteen successive steps or\r\nbenches. A freshet of a few yards would submerge many miles of flat\r\nshore, and a rise of 650 feet would in these days convert all but the\r\nhighest peaks of the surrounding eminences into islands and islets,\r\nthe kanyons into straits, creeks, and sea-arms, and the bluffs into\r\nslightly elevated shores. Popular opinion asserts that the process of\r\ndesiccation is going on at the rate of about half a mile in ten years.\r\nBut the limits of beach and drift line laid down by Captain Stansbury\r\nare still well defined, and the shrinking of the volume may be ranked\r\nwith its “sinking”--like the sink of the Humboldt and other rivers--an\r\nempirical explanation, by which the mountaineer removes the difficulty\r\nof believing that evaporation can drain off the supplies of so many\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\n[THE GREAT SALT LAKE.]\r\n\r\nThe lake, which is about the size of the African Chad, occupies the\r\nnortheastern corner of Utah Territory, and lies to the northwest of\r\nthe Great Salt Lake Valley, which is forty miles long by about twelve\r\nin breadth. The major axis of the irregular parallelogram is sixty to\r\nseventy miles in length from north to south, by thirty to thirty-five\r\nfrom east to west. Its altitude has been laid down at 4200 feet above,\r\nwhile the Dead Sea of Palestine is 1300 feet below sea level. The\r\nprincipal influents, beginning from the north, are the Bear River, the\r\nWeber River, and the Jordan. They supply the balance of evaporation,\r\nwhich from water is greater, and from high lands is usually less, than\r\nthe rain. The western side is a perfect desert--a salt and arid waste\r\nof clay and sand, with the consistence of mortar when wet, which can\r\nnot boast of a single stream; even the springs are sometimes separated\r\nby “jornadas” of seventy miles. When the rivers are in flood, the\r\nlake, it is said, rises to a maximum of four feet, overflowing large\r\ntracts of level saline plain, winding between the broken walls of\r\nrock which surround it on all sides. Near its shores the atmosphere\r\nis reeking, bluish, and hazy, from the effects of active evaporation,\r\nand forms a decided change from the purity and transparency of the air\r\nelsewhere. Surveyors have observed that it is a labor to use telescopes\r\nfor geoditic purposes, and that astronomical observations are very\r\nimperfect. The quantity of vapor is less, and evaporation has less\r\ntension and density from the surface of salt than of fresh water; here,\r\nhowever, the operation is assisted by sunheat sufficient to produce\r\nan aeriform state, and by a wind brisk enough to prevent the vapor\r\naccumulating over the surface.\r\n\r\nThe water of this remarkable feature, which so curiously reproduces\r\nthe marvels of Judea, contains nearly one quarter of solid matter, or\r\nabout six times and a half more than the average solid constituents of\r\nsea-water, which may be laid down roughly at three and a half per cent.\r\nof its weight, or about half an ounce to the pound.[179] The Dead Sea\r\nis its sole known superior. The specific gravity is 1·170, distilled\r\nwater being 1·000; the North Atlantic, between latitude 25° N. and\r\nlongitude 52° W. (G.), 1·020; and the Dead Sea, at 60° Fahrenheit, from\r\n1·22742 to 1·130. The vulgar estimate of its saltness is exaggerated.\r\nI have heard at Salt Lake City of one bucket of saline matter being\r\nproduced by the evaporation of three; and that meat can be salted,\r\nand corned beef converted into junk, after twelve or fourteen hours\r\nin the natural unevaporated brine. It is used without preparation\r\nby the citizens, who have not adopted the precautions recommended\r\nby Dr. Gale.[180] It is collected by boys, shoveled into carts at\r\nthe points of the beach where the winds dash up the waves--forming a\r\nregular wind-tide--and is sold in retail at half a cent per pound, or\r\ntwo shillings per hundred pounds. The original basin of geological\r\nages was, doubtless, as the shells have proved, fresh water. The\r\nsaline substances are brought down by rain, which washes the soil and\r\npercolates through the rocky ledges, and by the rivers, which are\r\ngenerally estimated to contain from ten to one hundred grains of salt\r\nper gallon,[181] and here probably more, owing to the abundance of\r\nsoda. The evaporation is, of course, nearly pure, containing but very\r\nminute traces of salts.\r\n\r\n  [179] “One hundred parts by weight were,” says Dr. Gale, “evaporated\r\n  to dryness in a water-bath below the boiling-point, and then heated\r\n  to about 300° of the thermometer, and retained at that heat till the\r\n  mass ceased to lose any weight.

It consists in sprinkling over the salt obtained by the\r\n  evaporation of the water, and heaped up in a bin or box containing\r\n  a porous bottom of blankets or other like material, a cold solution\r\n  of the salt as it is concentrated from the lake till crystals begin\r\n  to be deposited. This concentrated brine, while it will dissolve\r\n  none of the common salt, will dissolve all the chlorides of calcium\r\n  and magnesium, and carry them down through the porous bottom, and\r\n  thus leave the salt purer and better than any now found in our\r\n  markets. For persons who are obliged to prepare temporarily the salt,\r\n  as travelers passing through the country, the water of the lake,\r\n  without concentration, may be used for washing out the deliquescent\r\n  chlorides, sprinkling the heap of salt by a watering-pot at intervals\r\n  of two or three hours during a single day, and allowing it to drain\r\n  and dry at night, and be spread to the sun an hour or two the\r\n  following morning.”\r\n\r\n  [181] “The Physical Geography of the Sea” (by Captain Maury), chap.\r\n  ix., § 502, quoted from “Youmans’ Chemistry.”\r\n\r\nIt has been generally stated that the water is fatal to organic life.\r\nThe fish brought down the rivers perish at once in the concentrated\r\nbrine; but, according to the people, there is a univalve, like a\r\nperiwinkle, found at certain seasons within the influence of its saline\r\nwaves; and I observed, floating near the margin, delicate moss-like\r\nalgæ. Governor Cumming mentioned his having seen a leaf, of a few\r\ninches in length, lined with a web, which shelters a vermicular animal,\r\nof reddish color, and about the length of the last joint of the little\r\nfinger. Near the shore, also, mucilaginous matter, white, pink, and\r\nrusty, like macerated moss, adheres to the rocky bed, and lies in\r\ncoagulated spots upon the sand. We may fairly doubt the travelers’\r\nassertion that this Dead Sea contains no living thing; whereas neither\r\nanimalculæ nor vestige of animal matter were, according to Lieutenant\r\nLynch, detected by a powerful microscope in the waters of the\r\nAsphaltite Lake.\r\n\r\n[ISLANDS IN GREAT SALT LAKE.]\r\n\r\nThe Great Salt Lake is studded with an archipelago of islands, which\r\nwould greatly add to its charms were their size commensurate with its\r\ndiminutive limits. These, beginning from the north, are,\r\n\r\n1. Dolphin Island, so called from its shape, a knoll of rock and shoal\r\nnear the northwestern end, surrounded by about three feet of water.\r\n\r\n2. Gunnison’s Island, a large rock and small outlier, southeast of the\r\nformer, and surrounded with water from nine to twelve feet deep.\r\n\r\n3. Hat Island, southeast of Gunnison’s, the smallest of the isles, with\r\na reef sunk about seven feet: it was probably part of the following,\r\nand is separated from it by a narrow channel nowhere more than six feet\r\nin depth.\r\n\r\n4. Carrington Island, so named from the Mormon surveyor, a circular\r\nmass with a central peak: the water is from three to six feet deep on\r\nevery side except the western and southwestern, which are shoals and\r\nshallows. It contains no springs, but is rich in plants and flowers, as\r\nthe sego, also spelled sigo, seacoe, and segose (_Calochortus luteus_,\r\nan onion-like bulb or tuber about the size of a walnut, more nutritious\r\nthan palatable, much eaten as a table vegetable by the early Mormons\r\nand the root-digging Indians, and even now by white men when half\r\nstarved), a _cleome_, a _malvastrum_, a new species of _malacothrix_,\r\nand several others.\r\n\r\n5. Stansbury Island, the second largest in the lake, an ovate mass,\r\nwith a high central ridge, dome-shaped above, and rising 3000 feet,\r\ntwenty-seven miles in circumference, and about twelve in length. During\r\nthe dry season it is formed into a peninsula by a sand-bank connecting\r\nit with the lake’s western shore. Thus antelopes, deer, and coyotes\r\npass over to browse upon the plants and to attack the young of the\r\nducks, geese, plover, gulls, and pelicans, that make their homes upon\r\nthe cliffs: it is also used for grazing purposes. The principal plants\r\nare a _comandra_, and sundry new species of _heuchera_, _perityle_, and\r\n_stenactis_. Fossils and shells are found in scatters.\r\n\r\n6. Antelope, also called Church Island, because the stock of the\r\nSaints is generally kept there. Lying to the east and northeast of\r\nthe preceding, and in shape an irregular and protracted conoid, it\r\nis the largest of the islands, sixteen miles long by six of extreme\r\nwidth, with a western ridge and an eastern line of broken peaks, which\r\nattain a maximum of 3000 feet above the lake and 7200 above sea level.\r\nIt lies twenty miles to the northwest of the city, and the narrow\r\npassage between it and the opposite plain is fordable. This island is\r\nsurrounded on the north by a tufa bed twelve feet deep; eastward by six\r\nfeet of water; southeast and south by shoals; and westward by a deposit\r\nof black mud: the deepest sounding in the lake, thirty-five feet, is\r\nfound between it and Stansbury Island. Off the northwestern coast is\r\na rock, called, after its principal peculiarity, Egg Island: in the\r\neastern cliff there is said to be a cave, described to resemble the\r\nBlue Grotto at Capri, which has been partially explored. Formerly there\r\nwas a small pinnace on the “Big Shallow;” it has either been wrecked or\r\nbroken up for fuel.[182] Antelope Island contains arid ravines and a\r\nfew green valleys, besides a spring of pure water, and, being safe from\r\nIndians, it is much esteemed as a grazing-place.\r\n\r\n  [182] In the “Revue des Deux-Mondes” (April, 1861) we are told that,\r\n  “Pendant l’été un petit bateau à vapeur fait un service régulier\r\n  sur le Lac Salé.” Fresh proof, if it be required, how difficult, or\r\n  rather how impossible, it is for any amount of talent or ingenuity in\r\n  a reviewer to supply the want of actual eye-seeing information. The\r\n  “Lac Salé” is not yet come.\r\n\r\n7. Frémont Island, so named by Captain Stansbury from the first\r\nexplorer, who called it, after the rude dissipation of a dream of\r\n“tangled wilderness of trees and shrubbery, teeming with game of every\r\ndescription that the neighboring region afforded,” “Disappointment\r\nIsland.” The Mormons have preferred “Castle Island,” suggested by its\r\nmural and turreted peak, that rises above the higher levels. It lies\r\nnorth and northeast from Antelope Island, parallel with the mouth of\r\nthe Weber River, and south of Promontory Point, the bluff termination\r\nof a rocky tongue which separates Bear-River Bay from the body of\r\nthe lake. Its shape is a semilune, fifteen miles in circumference,\r\nabounding in plants, especially the Indian onion, but destitute of wood\r\nand water. Here, on the summit, Captain Frémont lost the “brass cover\r\nto the object-end of his spy-glass”--disdain not, gentle reader, these\r\nlittle reminiscences!--and Captain Stansbury failed to find the relic.\r\n\r\nI was surprised by the want of freshness and atmospheric elasticity\r\nin the neighborhood of the lake: the lips were salted as by sea air,\r\nbut there the similarity ended. We prepared for bathing by unhitching\r\nthe mules upon the usual picnicking place, a patch of soft white\r\nsand between the raised shore of the lake and the water brink. The\r\nbank supplies a plentiful stream of water, potable, though somewhat\r\nbrackish, bitter, and sulphurous: it shows its effects, however,\r\nin a clump of plants, wild roses, and the euphorbia of many names,\r\nsilk-plant, _vache à lait_, _capote de sacarte_, and milk-plant.\r\nThe familiar magpie prevented the solitude of the scene being too\r\nimpressive. Here was also a vestige of humanity, a kind of “lean-to” of\r\ndry stone wall, with the bank for a back-bone: you might have ridden\r\nover it without knowing that it belonged to Mrs. Smith of Vermont, now\r\ndeparted, unless warned off by the sudden appearance of what your\r\nsuperior sagacity would have discovered to be a chimney.\r\n\r\n[THE BATH IN THE GREAT SALT LAKE.]\r\n\r\nThe bathing-place is behind the Black Rock. The approach is first over\r\nthe fine soft white sand, like that of the sea-shore, but shell-less,\r\nsoppy where it receives the spring-water, and almost a quicksand near\r\nthe lake. The foot crunches through caked and crusty salt-flakes,\r\nhere white, there dark green, there dun-colored like _bois de vache_,\r\nand every where the reverse of aromatic, and sinks deep into the\r\neverlastingly wet sand below. This leads to the neck of broken, riven\r\nstone pavement, whose head is the Black Rock. As the lake is neared,\r\nthe basalt-like surface becomes red and rusty, the points are diamonded\r\nby sparkling spiculæ, and in the hollows and crevices where the waters\r\nhave dried to salt it gathers in the form of icy lumps. A dreadful\r\nshock then awaits the olfactory nerves. The black mud of peculiar\r\ndrift before alluded to proves to be an aceldama of insects: banks a\r\nfull foot high, composed of the _larvæ_, _exuviæ_, and mortal coils of\r\nmyriads of worms, musquetoes, gnats, and gallinippers, cast up by the\r\nwaves, and lining the little bay, as they ferment and fester in the\r\nburning sun, or pickle and preserve in the thick brine.[183] Escaping\r\nfrom this mass of fetor, I reached the farther end of the promontory\r\nwhere the Black Rock stood decorously between the bathing-place and the\r\npicnic ground, and in a pleasant frame of curiosity descended into the\r\nnew Dead Sea.\r\n\r\n  [183] According to Mr. T. R. Peale (quoted by Captain Stansbury,\r\n  Appendix C), “More than ⁹⁄₁₀ths of the mass is composed of the larvæ\r\n  and exuviæ of the _Chironomus_, or some species of musqueto, probably\r\n  undescribed.”\r\n\r\nI had heard strange accounts of its buoyancy. It was said to support a\r\nbather as if he were sitting in an arm-chair, and to float him like an\r\nunfresh egg. My experience differs in this point from that of others.\r\nThere was no difficulty in swimming, nor indeed in sinking. After\r\nsundry immersions of the head, in order to feel if it really stang and\r\nremoved the skin, like a mustard plaster--as described--emboldened by\r\nthe detection of so much hyperbole, I proceeded to duck under with\r\nopen eyes, and smarted “for my pains.” The sensation did not come on\r\nsuddenly; at first there was a sneaking twinge, then a bold succession\r\nof twinges, and lastly a steady, honest burning like what follows a\r\npinch of snuff in the eyes. There was no fresh water at hand; so,\r\nscrambling upon the rock, I sat there for half an hour, presenting\r\nto Nature the ludicrous spectacle of a man weeping flowing tears. A\r\nsecond experiment upon its taste was equally satisfactory; I can easily\r\nbelieve, with Captain Stansbury, that a man overboard has little chance\r\nagainst asphyxiation; _vox faucibus hœsit_ was the least that could be\r\nsaid concerning its effects upon my masticators. Those who try such\r\nexperiments may be warned that a jug filled at the fresh spring is\r\nnecessary in more ways than one. The hair on emersion is powdered like\r\nthe plastered locks of the knights of flamingo-plush and bell-hanging\r\nshoulder-knots, and there is a clammy stickiness, which is exceedingly\r\nunpleasant. Salt, moreover, may be scraped from the skin--imaginative\r\nbathers have compared themselves to Lot’s wife--and the Ethiop,\r\nnow prosaically termed “nigger,” comes out after a bath bleached,\r\nwhitewashed, and with changed epidermis.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the _fumet_ from the kitchen of that _genius loci_\r\nwhom I daurna name, we dined with excellent appetite. While the mules\r\nwere being hitched to, I found an opportunity of another survey from\r\nbelow the Black Rock: this look-out station is sometimes ascended by\r\nthose gifted with less than the normal modicum of common sense. The\r\nlands immediately about the lake are flat, rising almost imperceptibly\r\nto the base of abrupt hills, which are broken in places by soft and\r\nsandy barriers, irreclaimable for agriculture, but here and there fit\r\nfor grazing; where springs exist, they burst out at too low a level\r\nfor irrigation. The meridional range of the Oquirrh, at whose northern\r\npoint we were standing, divides the Great Salt Lake Valley from its\r\nwestern neighbor Tooele or Tuilla, which in sound curiously resembles\r\nthe Arabic Tawíleh--the Long Valley. It runs like most of these\r\nformations from north to south: it is divided by a transverse ridge\r\ndeclining westward, and not unaptly called Traverse Mountain, from Rush\r\nValley, which again is similarly separated from Cedar Valley. From the\r\npoint where we stood, the only way to Tooele settlement is round the\r\nnorth point of West Mountain, a bold headland, rugged with rocks and\r\ntrees. Westward of Tooele Valley, and separated by a sister range to\r\nthe Oquirrh, lies Spring Valley, so called because it boasts a sweet\r\nfountain, and south of this “Skull Valley”--an ominous name, but the\r\nevil omen was to the bison.\r\n\r\nBidding a long farewell to that inland briny sea, which apparently\r\nhas no business there, we turned our faces eastward as the sun was\r\ndeclining. The view had memorable beauties. From the blue and purple\r\nclouds, gorgeously edged with celestial fire, shot up a fan of penciled\r\nand colored light, extending half way to the zenith, while in the south\r\nand southeast lightnings played among the darker mist-masses, which\r\nbacked the golden and emerald bench-lands of the farther valley. The\r\nsplendid sunset gave a reflex of its loveliness to the alkaline and\r\nartemisia barrens before us. Opposite, the Wasach, vast and voluminous,\r\nthe store-house of storms, and of the hundred streams that cool the\r\nthirsty earth, rose in stern and gloomy grandeur, which even the last\r\nsmile of day failed to soften, over the subject plain. Northward, to\r\na considerable distance, the lake-lands lay uninterrupted save by an\r\noccasional bench and a distant swell, resembling the upper convexity\r\nof a thunder-cloud. As we advanced, the city became dimly discernible\r\nbeyond Jordan, built on ground gently rising away from the lake, and\r\nstrongly nestling under its protecting mountains. A little to its\r\nnortheast, a thin white vapor, like the spray of a spouting whale,\r\nshowed the direction of the Hot Springs: as time wore on it rolled\r\naway, condensed by the cooling air, like the smoke of a locomotive\r\nbefore the evening breeze. Then the prominent features of the city came\r\ninto view, the buildings separated themselves from their neighbors\r\nby patches and shades of several green, the streets opened out their\r\nregular rows and formal lines; once more we rolled over Jordan’s\r\nrickety bridge, and found ourselves again in the Holy City of the Far\r\nWest.\r\n\r\n[TRIP TO CAMP FLOYD.]\r\n\r\nThe ultimate destination of the Judiciary whom I had accompanied was\r\nCarson Valley, in the Sierra Nevada, a distance of some hundreds of\r\nmiles through a wild country where “lifting of hair” is by no means\r\nuncommon. The judge, though not a sucking diplomat, had greenly relied\r\nupon _bona verba_ at Washington for transportation, escort, and other\r\nnecessaries which would be easily procurable at Camp Floyd. It was\r\nsoon found advisable to apply to the military authorities at the\r\ncantonment. The coach, as I have said, had ceased to run beyond Great\r\nSalt Lake City. In May, 1858, a contract had been made with Major\r\nGeorge Chorpenning to transport mails and passengers--the fare being\r\n$120--from Utah to California, he receiving $130,000. This lasted till\r\nSeptember, 1859, when the drivers, complaining that the road-agents\r\ncharged with paying them for eighteen months had expended the “rocks”\r\nin the hells of San Francisco, notably evinced their race’s power\r\nof self-government by seizing and selling off by auction wagons and\r\nsimilar movable property. On the 20th of March, 1860, it came into\r\nthe hands of the proprietors of the Eastern line, Messrs. Russell and\r\nCo., who ran a mail-wagon first to California, then to Camp Floyd, and\r\nlastly, on the 1st of June, finding their expenditure excessive, packed\r\nthe mails on mules.[184] Single travelers were sometimes thus pushed\r\nthrough, starting on the Wednesdays, once a fortnight; for a party like\r\nours such a proceeding would have been impossible. Consequently, the\r\njudge and I set out for Camp Floyd to see what could be done by “Uncle\r\nSam” and his “eagles.”\r\n\r\n  [184] They carry 50 to 60 lbs.; and the schedule time to Placerville\r\n  is sixteen days.\r\n\r\nMr. Gilbert--of the firm of Gilbert, Gerrish, and Co., general\r\n(Gentile) merchants--offered us seats in his trotting wagon, drawn by a\r\nfine tall pair of iron-gray mules, that cost $500 the twain, and were\r\nchristened Julia and Sally, after, I believe, the fair daughters of\r\nthe officer who had lately commanded the district. With a fine clear\r\nday and a breeze which veiled us with dust-hangings--the highway must\r\nbe a sea of mud in wet weather--we set out along the county road,\r\nleading from the southeastern angle of the Holy City. Our route lay\r\nover the strip of alluvium that separates the Wasach Mountains from\r\nthe waters of Jordan: it is cut by a multitude of streamlets rising\r\nfrom the kanyons; the principal are Mill Creek, Big Cotton-wood,\r\nLittle Cotton-wood, Dry Cotton-wood, and Willow Creek. The names are\r\ntranslated from the Indians, and we saw from the road traces of the\r\naborigines, who were sweeping crickets and grass-seed into their large\r\nconical baskets--among these ragged gleaners we looked in vain for\r\na Ruth. Near Big Cotton-wood, where there is a settlement distant\r\nseven miles from the city, an English woman came across the fields\r\nand complained that she had been frightened by four Indian braves\r\nwho had been riding by to bring in a stolen horse. The waters of the\r\nkanyons are exceedingly cool, sweet, and clear, and suggested frequent\r\nreference to a superior kind of tap which had been stored away within\r\nthe trap. In proportion as we left the city, the sterility of the River\r\nValley increased; cultivation was unseen except upon the margins of the\r\nstreams, and the look of the land was “real mean.” In front of us lay\r\nthe denticulated bench bounding the southern end of the valley.\r\n\r\nAfter twenty miles from the city we reached a ranch on rising ground,\r\nnear the water-gate of the Jordan. It was built at an expense of\r\n$17,000, and was called the Utah Brewery. Despite, however, the plenty\r\nof hop and barley, the speculation proved a failure, and the house had\r\nbecome a kind of mail-station. Between it and the river were a number\r\nof little rush-girt “eyes”--round pools, some hot, others cold--and\r\nsaid to be unfathomable; that is to say, from twenty to thirty fathoms\r\ndeep. They related that a dragoon, slipping with his charger into\r\none of them, found a watery grave, where a drier death might have\r\nbeen expected. At the ranch we rested for an hour, but called in vain\r\nfor food. From the Utah Brewery, which is about half way, drivers\r\nreckon twenty-two miles to Camp Floyd, making a total of forty-two\r\nto forty-three miles between the head-quarters of the saint and the\r\nsinner, and we therefore looked forward to a “banian day.”\r\n\r\nAbout noon we hitched to and proceeded to ascend Traverse Mountain,\r\na ridge-like spur of the Wasach, running east and west. It separates\r\nthe Valley of the Northern or Great Salt Lake from the basin of the\r\nUtah, or Sweetwater Lake, to the southward, and is broken through by\r\nthe waters of Jordan. The young river--called Piya Ogwap, or the Big\r\nWater, by the Shoshonees--here rushes in a foaming shallow stream, that\r\ncan barely float a dug-out, over a rocky, pebbly bed, in the sole of\r\na deep but short kanyon, which winds its way through the cross range.\r\nThe descent is about 100 feet in two miles, after which the course\r\nserpentines, the banks fall, and the current becomes gentle.\r\n\r\nAs we toiled up the Dug-way, the graded incline that runs along the\r\nshoulder of the mountain, we saw a fine back view of the Happy Valley\r\nthrough an atmosphere clear as that of the English littoral before\r\nrain. Advancing higher, we met, face to face, an ambulance full of\r\nuniform _en route_ to the Holy City, drawn by four neat mules, and\r\naccompanied by strikers--military servants. We drew up, the judge was\r\nreadily recognized, and I was introduced to Captains Heth, Clarke, and\r\nGibson, and to Lieutenant Robinson. They began with an act of charity,\r\nsupplying ham sandwiches to half-starved men, and I afterward spent\r\npleasant evenings with them at Great Salt Lake City, and became Captain\r\nHeth’s guest at Camp Floyd. Their kindness and hospitality lasted to\r\nthe end of my stay. After the usual “liquoring up,” they pointed to\r\nAsh Hollow, the depths below, where the Mormons had intended to make a\r\nnew Thermopylæ. Promising to meet them again, we then shook hands and\r\nresumed our road.\r\n\r\nThe steep descent on the counterslope of Traverse Mountain disclosed to\r\nus the first sight of Utah Lake, which is to its sister what Carmel is\r\nto Lebanon. It was a soft and sunny, a placid and beautiful landscape,\r\nhighly refreshing after the arid lands on the other side. A panorama\r\nof lake, plain, and river lay before us. On the east, south, and west\r\nwere rugged walls and peaks of mountain and hill; and northward a broad\r\ngrassy slope rose to the divide between the valleys of the Fresh and of\r\nthe Salt Lake. From afar the binding of plain round the basin appeared\r\nso narrow that the mountains seemed to dip their feet into the quiet\r\nreservoir; and beyond the southern point the lone peak of lofty Nebo\r\nstood, to adopt the Koranic comparison, like one of the pins which\r\nfasten down the plains of earth. A nearer approach discovers a broad\r\nbelt of meadow, rich alluvial soil, in parts marshy, and in others\r\narable, wheat and root-crop flourishing in the bottom, and bunch-grass\r\nupon the acclivities. The breadth is greater to the west and south of\r\nthe lake than in other parts. It is cut by many a poplar-fringed stream\r\nthat issues from the tremendous gorges around--the American Fork, the\r\nTimpanogos[185] or Provo River, and the Spanish Fork. On the near side,\r\nbeyond the winding Jordan, lay little Lehi, whose houses were half hid\r\nby black trees; and eastward of the Utah Water, dimly visible, was\r\nProvo City, on a plain watered by four creeks. Such were the environs\r\nof the Sea of Tiberias.\r\n\r\n  [185] From _Timpa_, a rock, and _ogwabe_, contracted to _oge_, a\r\n  river, in the Yuta dialect. In English maps published as late as\r\n  seven years ago, “Timpanogos” is applied to the Great Salt Lake!\r\n  _Provo_ or _Provaux_ is the name of a Canadian trapper and trader,\r\n  who in past times defeated with eighty men a thousand Indians, and\r\n  was killed at the moment of victory. The Mormons call the City\r\n  _Provo_, and Gentiles prefer as a “rile” _Timpanogos_.\r\n\r\n[UTAH LAKE.]\r\n\r\nThe Utah Lake, another Judean analogue, derives its supplies from the\r\nwestern versant of the Wasach. It is in shape an irregular triangle,\r\nthe southern arm forming a very acute angle. The extreme length\r\nis thirty miles, and the greatest breadth is fifteen. It owes its\r\nsweetness, which, however, is by no means remarkable, to its northern\r\ndrainage, the Piya Ogwap, _alias_ Utah Outlet, _alias_ Jordan River.\r\nNear the shores the water soon deepens to fifteen feet; the bottom is\r\nsaid to be smooth, uniform, and very profound in places; but probably\r\nit has never been sounded. The bed, where it shows, is pebbly; a\r\nwhite, chalky incrustation covers the shallower bottom; shells,\r\nespecially the fresh-water clam, are numerous upon the watery margin;\r\nthe flaggy “Deserét weed” in the tulares is ten feet high,[186] and\r\nthicket is dense in places where rock does not occupy the soil. The\r\nwestern side is arid for want of influents; there is a “lone tree,”\r\na solitary cotton-wood, conspicuous amid the grazing-ground of\r\nbunch-grass, sage, and greasewood, and the only inhabitants, excepting\r\na single ranch--Evan’s--are, apparently, the Phrynosoma and the lizard,\r\nthe raven and the jackass-rabbit. The Utah Lake freezes in December,\r\nJanuary, and February. At these months the Jordan rolls down floes of\r\nice, but it is seldom to be traversed on foot. In the flood season it\r\nrises two, and the wind tide extends to about three feet. It is still\r\nfull of fish, which in former times were carried off in barrels. The\r\nwhite trout weigh thirty pounds. There are many kinds of mountain trout\r\naveraging three pounds, while salmon trout, suckers, and mudfish are\r\nuncommonly large and plentiful; water-snakes and “horsehair fish” are\r\nalso found.\r\n\r\n  [186] Tulare is a marsh of bulrush (_Scirpus lacustris_), which\r\n  is found extending over immense tracts of river valley in Western\r\n  America. “Tooly” water, as it is pronounced, is that which is\r\n  flavored or tainted by it.\r\n\r\nAfter descending the steep incline we forded the Jordan, at that point\r\n100 feet broad, and deep to the wagon-hubs. The current was not too\r\nswift to prevent the growth of weeds. The water was of sulphury color,\r\nthe effect of chalk, and the taste was brackish, but not unpleasant;\r\ncattle are said to like it. The fording was followed by a long ascent,\r\nthe divide between Utah Valley and its western neighbor Cedar Valley.\r\nAbout half way between the Brewery and the Camp is a station, held by\r\na Shropshire Mormon, whose only name, as far as I could discover, was\r\nJoe Dug-out, so called, like the Watertons de Waterton, from the style\r\nof his habitation. He had married a young woman, who deterred him from\r\ngiving her a sister--every Oriental language has a word to express\r\nwhat in English, which lacks the thing, is rudely translated “a rival\r\nwife”--by threatening to have his ears cut off by the “horfficers.”\r\nJoe, however, seemed quite resigned to the pains and penalties of\r\nmonogamy, and, what was more to our purpose, had a good brew of porter\r\nand Lager-bier.\r\n\r\nHaving passed on the way a road that branches off to the old camp,\r\nwhich was deserted for want of water, we sighted from afar the new\r\ncantonment. It lies in a circular basin, surrounded by irregular hills\r\nof various height, still wooded with black cedar, where not easily\r\nfelled, and clustering upon the banks of Cedar Creek, a rivulet which\r\npresently sinks in a black puddly mud. For a more thoroughly detestable\r\nspot one must repair to Gharra, or some similar purgatorial place\r\nin Lower Sindh. The winter is long and rigorous, the summer hot and\r\nuncomfortable, the alkaline water curdles soap, and the dust-storms\r\nremind one of the Punjaub. I lost no time in suggesting to my\r\n_compagnon de voyage_, Lieutenant Dana, as a return for his kindness\r\nin supplying me with a “Bayonet Exercise,” and other papers, our old\r\ncampaigning habit of hanging wet canvas before every adit, and received\r\nthe well-merited thanks of Madam. The hardest part of these hardships\r\nis that they are wholly purposeless. Every adobe brick in the place\r\nhas been estimated to have cost a cent, as at Aden each cut stone was\r\ncounted a rupee; and the purchase of lumber has enriched the enemy. In\r\n1858 the Peace Commissioners sent by the supreme government conceded\r\nto the Mormons a point which saved the Saints. The army was not to be\r\n“located” within forty miles of Great Salt Lake City; thus the pretty\r\nsites about Utah Lake were banned to them, and the Mormons, it is said,\r\n“jockeyed” them out of the rich and fertile Cache Valley, eighty miles\r\nnorth of the head-quarters.\r\n\r\n[CAMP FLOYD.]\r\n\r\nA broken wall surrounds this horrid hole. Julia and Sally carried us in\r\nwith unflagging vigor. We passed through Fairfield, less euphoniously\r\ntermed Frogtown, the bazar of the cantonment on the other side of the\r\ncreek. During the days when Camp Floyd contained its full complement\r\nof camp followers--5000 souls--now reduced to 100 or 200 men, it must\r\nhave been a delectable spot, teeming with gamblers and blacklegs,\r\ngrog-house-keepers and prostitutes: the revolver and the bowie-knife\r\nhad nightly work to do there, and the moral Saints were fond of\r\nlikening Frogtown to certain Cities of the Plains. Of late years it has\r\nbecome more respectable, and now it contains some good stores.\r\n\r\nWe removed from the wagon the mail-bags containing letters for the\r\ncamp, and made ourselves at home with the hospitable Gilbert. On the\r\nnext day, after “morning glory” and breakfast, we called upon the\r\nofficer commanding the department, Colonel P. St. G. Cooke, of the\r\n2d Dragoons, and upon the commandant of the cantonment, Lieutenant\r\nColonel C. F. Smith. They introduced us to the greater part of the\r\nofficers, and, though living in camp fashion, did not fail to take\r\nin the strangers after the ancient, not the modern, acceptation of\r\nthe term. It is a sensible pleasure, which every military man has\r\nremarked, to exchange the common run of civilian for soldier society in\r\nthe United States. The reveillé in the morning speaks of discipline;\r\nthe guard-mounting has a wholesome military sound; there is a habit\r\nof ’tention and of saluting which suggests some subordination; the\r\norderlies say “Sir,” not Sirree nor Sirree-bob. The stiffness and\r\nungeniality of professionals, who are all running a race for wealth\r\nor fame, give way in a service of seniority, and where men become\r\nbrothers, to the frankness which belongs to the trade of arms. The\r\nKshatriya, or fighting caste, in the States is distinctly marked.\r\nThe officers, both of the navy and the army, are, for the most part,\r\nSoutherners, and are separated by their position from general society.\r\nThe civilian, as was the case in England twenty years ago, dislikes\r\nthe uniform. His principal boasts are, that he pays his fighting\r\nservants well, and that he--a militia-man--is far superior to the\r\nregular. A company of Cadets, called the Chicago Zouaves, during the\r\nsummer of 1860, made a sensation throughout the land. The newspaper\r\nwriters spoke of them in terms far higher than have been lavished upon\r\nthe flower of the French army; even the military professionals were\r\nobliged to join in the cry. As a republican, the citizen looks upon a\r\nsoldier as a drone. “I hate those cormorants,” said to me an American\r\ndiplomat, who, _par parenthèse_, had made a fortune by the law, as he\r\nentered a Viennese café. _L’arte della guerra presto s’ impara_ is his\r\nmotto, and he evinces his love of the civilian element by giving away\r\na considerable percentage of commissions in the army to those whose\r\npolitical influence enables them to dispense with the preparation of\r\nWest Point.\r\n\r\n[UNITED STATES MILITIA.]\r\n\r\nI am here tempted to a few words concerning the cheap defense and\r\nthe chief pride of the United States, viz., her irregular army. The\r\nopposite table shows the forces of the militia to be three millions,\r\nwhile the regular army does not number 19,000. The institution is,\r\ntherefore, a kind of public, a writing, speaking, voting body, which\r\nmakes itself heard and felt, while the existence of the regulars is\r\nalmost ignored. To hint aught against the militia in the United States\r\nis sure seriously to “rile up” your civil audience, and Elijah Pogram\r\nwill perhaps let you know that you can not know what you are talking\r\nabout. The outspoken Britisher, despite his title and his rank as\r\na general officer, had a “squeak” for his commission when, in the\r\nbeginning of the volunteer mania, he spoke of the new levies as a\r\nuseless body of men: it is on the same principle in the United States.\r\nThus also the liberal candidate declares to his electors his “firm\r\nbelief that, with all our enormous expenditure, the country had not\r\nfelt itself secure, and straightway a noble arm of defense, springing\r\nunbought from the patriotism of the people, had crept into existence,\r\nforming a better shield for our national liberties than all that we had\r\nbeen able to buy with our mounds of gold.” (Cheers.) The civilian in\r\nthe United States boasts of his military institutions, his West Point\r\nand his regular army, and never fails to inform a stranger that it is\r\nbetter paid than any force in Europe. On the other hand, he prides\r\nhimself upon, as he is probably identified with, the militia.\r\n\r\nMILITIA FORCE OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n_General Abstract of the Militia Force of the United States, according\r\nto the latest Returns received at the Office of the Adjutant General._\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------+----+---------+---------+---------+---------+\r\n  |                       |    |         |         |         |         |\r\n  |                       |    |         |         |         |         |\r\n  |                       | For|         | General |  Field  |         |\r\n  |                       | the| General |  Staff  |Officers,| Company |\r\n  |States and Territories.|Year|Officers.|Officers.|  etc.   |Officers.|\r\n  +-----------------------+----+---------+---------+---------+---------+\r\n  |Maine                  |1856|    13   |     52  |     36  |     230 |\r\n  |New Hampshire          |1854|    11   |    202  |    119  |     895 |\r\n  |Massachusetts          |1859|    10   |     47  |    111  |     353 |\r\n  |Vermont                |1843|    12   |     51  |    224  |     801 |\r\n  |Rhode Island           |1858|     2   |     22  |    106  |      26 |\r\n  |Connecticut            |1858|     3   |      9  |     82  |     199 |\r\n  |New York               |1856|    93   |    299  |  1,531  |   5,495 |\r\n  |New Jersey             |1852|         |         |         |         |\r\n  |Pennsylvania           |1858|         |         |         |         |\r\n  |Delaware               |1827|     4   |      8  |     71  |     364 |\r\n  |Maryland               |1838|    22   |     68  |    544  |   1,763 |\r\n  |Virginia               |1858|         |         |         |         |\r\n  |North Carolina         |1845|    28   |    133  |    657  |   3,449 |\r\n  |South Carolina         |1856|    20   |    135  |    535  |   1,909 |\r\n  |Georgia                |1850|    39   |     91  |    624  |   4,296 |\r\n  |Florida                |1845|     3   |     14  |     95  |     508 |\r\n  |Alabama                |1851|    32   |    142  |    775  |   1,883 |\r\n  |Louisiana              |1859|    16   |    129  |    542  |   2,105 |\r\n  |Mississippi            |1838|    15   |     70  |    856  |     348 |\r\n  |Tennessee              |1840|    25   |     79  |    392  |   2,644 |\r\n  |Kentucky               |1852|    43   |    145  |  1,165  |   3,517 |\r\n  |Ohio                   |1858|         |         |         |         |\r\n  |Michigan               |1854|    30   |    123  |    147  |   2,358 |\r\n  |Indiana                |1832|    31   |    110  |    566  |   2,154 |\r\n  |Illinois               |1855|         |         |         |         |\r\n  |Wisconsin              |1855|    15   |      8  |    215  |     904 |\r\n  |Iowa                   |    |         |         |         |         |\r\n  |Missouri               |1853|         |     17  |      4  |      67 |\r\n  |Arkansas               |1859|    10   |     39  |    179  |     911 |\r\n  |Texas                  |1847|    15   |     45  |    248  |     940 |\r\n  |California             |1857|    18   |    126  |     11  |     175 |\r\n  |Minnesota              |1859|         |         |         |         |\r\n  |Oregon                 |    |         |         |         |         |\r\n  |Washington Territory   |    |         |         |         |         |\r\n  |Nebraska Territory     |    |         |         |         |         |\r\n  |Kansas Territory       |    |         |         |         |         |\r\n  |Territory of Utah      |1853|     2   |         |     48  |     235 |\r\n  |Territory of N.

The\r\nfame of the irregulars penetrated to Calcutta and China: it was\r\nstopped only by the Orient sun. But who ever heard of the regulars?\r\nThe “newspaper heroes” were almost all militiamen, rangers, and other\r\nguerrillas: “keeping an editor in pay” is now a standing sarcasm. The\r\nsages of the Revolution initiated a yeomanry second to none in the\r\nworld: they had, however, among them crowds of frontiersmen accustomed\r\nto deal with the bear and the Indian, not with the antelope and the\r\ndeer. The Texan Rangers in later times were a first-rate body of\r\nmen for irregular purposes, not to be confounded with the militia,\r\nyet always put forward as a proof how superior to the “sweepings\r\nof cities,” as the regular army was once called in the Senate, are\r\nthe irregulars, who “never fire a random shot, never draw trigger\r\ntill their aim is sure,” and are “here to-night and to-morrow are\r\nfifty miles off.” But the true modern militia is pronounced by the\r\nbest authorities--indeed, by all who hold it no economy to be ill\r\nserved, for any but purely defensive purposes, a humbug, which costs\r\nin campaigns more blood and gold--neglect of business is perhaps the\r\nchief item of the expenditure--than a standing army would. As a “Garde\r\nNationale” it is quite efficient. When called out for distant service,\r\nas in the Mexican War, every _pekin_ fault becomes apparent. Personally\r\nthe men suffer severely from unaccustomed hardship and exposure; in\r\ndangerous climates they die like sheep; half are in hospital, and the\r\nother half must nurse them: Nature soon becomes stronger than martial\r\nlaw; under the fatigue of the march they will throw away their rations\r\nand military necessaries rather than take the trouble to carry them:\r\nimprovident and wasteful, their convoys are timid and unmanageable.\r\nMentally they are in many cases men ignoring the common restraints of\r\nsociety, profoundly impressed with insubordination, which displays\r\nequality, which has to learn all the wholesome duty of obedience, and\r\nwhich begins with as much respect for discipline as for the campaigns\r\nof Frederick the Great. If inclined to retire, they can stay at\r\nhome and obtain double or treble the wages: not a few are driven to\r\nservice by that enthusiasm which, as Sir Charles Napier well remarked,\r\nreadily makes men run away. Their various defects make organization\r\npainfully slow. In camp they amuse themselves with drawing rations,\r\ntarget practice, asking silly questions, electing officers, holding\r\nmeetings, issuing orders, disobeying orders, “’cussing and discussing:”\r\nthe sentinels will sit down to a quiet _euchre_ after planting their\r\nbayonets in the ground, and to all attempts at dislodging them the\r\nreply will be, “You go to ----, Cap.! I’m as good a man as you.” In the\r\nfield, like all raw levies, they are apt to be alarmed by any thing\r\nunaccustomed, as the sound of musketry from the rear, or a threatened\r\nflank attack: they can not reserve their fire; they aim wildly, to\r\nthe peril of friend and foe, and they have been accused of unmilitary\r\ncruelties, such as scalping and flaying men, shooting and killing\r\nsquaws and children. And they never fail, after the fashion of such\r\nmen, to claim that they have done all the fighting.[187]\r\n\r\n  [187] These remarks were penned in 1860; I see no reason to alter\r\n  them in 1861.\r\n\r\nSuch is, I believe, the United States militia at the beginning of a\r\ncampaign. After a reasonable time, say a year, which kills off the weak\r\nand sickly, and rubs out the brawler and the mutineer; when men have\r\nlearned to distinguish the difference between the often Dutch courage\r\nof a bowie-knife squabble and the moral fortitude that stands firm\r\nin presence of famine or a night attack, then they become regulars.\r\nThe American--by which I understand a man whose father is born in the\r\nUnited States--is a first-rate soldier, distinguished by his superior\r\nintelligence from his compeers in other lands; but he rarely takes to\r\nsoldiering. There are not more than five of these men per company, the\r\nrest being all Germans and Irishmen. The percentage in the navy is\r\ngreater, yet it is still inconsiderable. The Mexican War, as History\r\nwrites it, is the triumph of the militia, whom old “Rough and Ready”\r\nled to conquest as to a “manifest destiny.”[188] On the other hand,\r\nthe old and distinguished officer who succeeded General Taylor has\r\noccasionally, it is said, given utterance to opinions concerning the\r\nirregulars which contrast strongly with those generally attributed to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n  [188] And it will be remembered, the Mexicans were not Austrians or\r\n  Russians.\r\n\r\n[HATRED AND MURDER.--SERGEANT PIKE.--MR. HENNEFER.]\r\n\r\nAt Camp Floyd I found feeling running high against the Mormons. “They\r\nhate us, and we hate them,” said an intelligent officer; consequently,\r\nevery statement here, as in the city, must be received with many\r\ngrains of salt. At Camp Floyd one hears the worst version of every\r\nfact, which, as usual hereabouts, has its many distinct facets. These\r\nanti-Mormons declare that ten murders per annum during the last twelve\r\nyears have been committed without punishment in New Zion, whereas New\r\nYork averages 18-33. They attribute the phenomenon to the impossibility\r\nof obtaining testimony, and the undue whitewashing action of juries,\r\nwhich the Mormons declare to be “punctual and hard-working in\r\nsustaining the dignity of the law,” and praise for their “unparalleled\r\nhabits of industry and sobriety, order, and respect to just rights.”\r\nWhatever objection I made was always answered by the deception of\r\nappearances, and the assertion that whenever a stranger enters Great\r\nSalt Lake City, one or two plausible Mormons are told off to amuse\r\nand hoodwink him. Similarly the Mormons charge the Christians with\r\nviolent injustice. On a late occasion, the mayor of Springville, Mr.\r\nH. F. Macdonald, and the bishop were seized simply because they were\r\nChurch dignitaries, on the occasion of a murder, and the former, after\r\ndurance vile of months at Camp Floyd, made his escape and walks about\r\na free man, swearing that he will not again be taken alive. In 1853,\r\nCaptain J. W. Gunnison and seven of his party were murdered near\r\nNicollet on Sevier River, twenty-five miles south of Nephi City. The\r\nanti-Mormons declare that the deed was done under high counsel, by\r\n“white Indians,” to prevent the exploration of a route to California,\r\nand the disclosures which were likely to be made. The Mormons point\r\nto their kind treatment of the previous expedition upon which the\r\nlamented officer was engaged, to the friendliness of his book, to the\r\ncircumstance that an Indian war was then raging, and that during the\r\nattack an equal number of Yuta Indians were killed. M. Remy distinctly\r\nrefers the murder to the Pahvant Indians, some of whom had been\r\nrecently shot by emigrants to California.[189] The horrible “Mountain\r\nMeadow Massacre”[190] was, according to the anti-Mormons, committed\r\nby the Saints to revenge the death of an esteemed apostle--Parley P.\r\nPratt--who, in the spring of 1857, when traveling through Arkansas,\r\nwas knived by one Hector M‘Lean, whose wife he had converted and\r\ntaken unto himself. The Mormons deny that the massacre was committed\r\nby their number, and ask the Gentiles why, if such be the case, the\r\nmurderers are not brought to justice? They look upon Mr. P. P. Pratt’s\r\nproceeding--even in El Islam, the women of the infidels are, like\r\ntheir property, _halal_, or lawful to those who win them--as perfectly\r\njustifiable.[191] In February, 1859, occurred sundry disturbances\r\nbetween the soldiers and citizens at Rush Valley, thirty-five miles\r\nwest of Great Salt Lake City, in which Mr. Howard Spencer, nephew to\r\nMr. Daniel Spencer, a squatter, while being removed from a government\r\nreservation by First Sergeant Ralph Pike of the 10th Infantry, raised\r\na pitchfork, and received in return a broken head. Shortly afterward\r\nthe sergeant, having been summoned to Great Salt Lake City, was met\r\nin Main Street and shot down before all present. The anti-Mormons, of\r\ncourse, declare the deed to have been done by Mr. Spencer, and hold it,\r\nunder the circumstances--execution of duty and summons of justice--an\r\nunpardonable outrage; and the officers assert that they could hardly\r\nprevent their men arming and personally revenging the foul murder of a\r\ncomrade, who was loved as an excellent soldier and an honest man.[192]\r\nThe Mormons assert that the “shooting” was done by an unknown hand;\r\nthat the sergeant had used unnecessary violence against a youth, who,\r\nsingle-handed and surrounded by soldiers, had raised a pitchfork to\r\ndefend his head, and that the provocation thus received converted the\r\ncase from murder to one of justifiable homicide. In the month of June\r\nbefore my arrival, a Lieutenant Saunders and Assistant Surgeon Covey\r\nhad tied to a cart’s tail and severely flogged Mr. Hennefer, a Mormon.\r\nThe opposition party assert that they recognized in him the man who\r\ntwo years before had acted as a spy upon them when sitting in Messrs.\r\nLivingston’s store, and, when ordered to “make tracks,” had returned\r\nwith half a dozen others, and had shot Dr. Covey in the breast. The\r\nMormons represent Mr. Hennefer to be a peaceful citizen, and quiet,\r\nunoffending man, thus brutally outraged by tyrannical servants of\r\ngovernment, and, moreover, prove for him an _alibi_ from the original\r\ncause of quarrel. I have given but a few instances: all are equally\r\ncontradictory, and _tantas componere lites quis audet_?\r\n\r\n  [189] See Translation, vol. i., p. 463.\r\n\r\n  [190] The following is the account of that affair, officially given,\r\n  of course, by anti-Mormons: On the 4th or 5th of September, 1857,\r\n  a large emigrant train from Arkansas, proceeding to California\r\n  with horses, mules, and ox-wagons, conveying stores of clothing\r\n  and valuables, was suddenly attacked near a spring at the west end\r\n  of Mountain Meadow Valley. The Indians, directed by white men, cut\r\n  off from water the travelers, who had fortified themselves behind\r\n  the vehicles, which they filled with earth, and killed and wounded\r\n  several. When the attacked party, distressed by thirst and a galling\r\n  fire, showed symptoms of surrender, several Mormons, among whom the\r\n  leaders, John D. Lee and Elder Isaac C. Haight, are particularly\r\n  mentioned, approached them with a white flag, and by soft words\r\n  persuaded them that if they would give up their weapons they should\r\n  be safely forwarded to Panther Creek and Cedar City. The emigrants\r\n  unwisely disarmed themselves, and flocked toward the spring. The\r\n  work of murder and robbery began near a patch of scrub-oak brush,\r\n  about one mile and a half from water. Between 115 and 120 adults\r\n  were slain. Three emerged from the valley; of these, two were soon\r\n  overtaken and killed, and the third was slaughtered at Muddy Creek,\r\n  distant about fifty miles. One of the Mormons--the name has been\r\n  variously given--is accused of a truly detestable deed; a girl,\r\n  sixteen years old, knelt to him, imploring mercy; he led her away\r\n  into the thicket--and then cut her throat. Seventeen children, aged\r\n  from two months to seven years, were taken from the Indians by the\r\n  whites, and were distributed among the several Mormon families in\r\n  Cedar City, Fort Harmony, Santa Clara, etc. Of these, sixteen were\r\n  recovered, and the seventeenth was found in the April of 1858. Mr.\r\n  Jacob Forney, the late Superintendent of Indian Affairs, conducted\r\n  the investigation on the part of the federal government; he reported\r\n  that white men joined in the murder and the robbery. The Mormons\r\n  of course deny, _in toto_, complicity with the Indians, and remark\r\n  that many trains--for instance, to quote no others, the emigrants at\r\n  Sublette’s Cut-off, Oregon, in August, 1858--have similarly suffered,\r\n  and that they can not be responsible for the misfortunes which men\r\n  who insult and ill-treat the natives bring upon themselves.\r\n\r\n  [191] The following is an extract from the “Millennial Star,” July\r\n  25th, 1857. The article is headed “More of the Assassination:”\r\n  “We publish the following extract from a letter written by two\r\n  gentlemen to the editor of a New York paper. The letter was dated\r\n  Flint-Cherokee Nation, Arkansas, May 17th, 1857, and says that after\r\n  Elder Pratt was arrested in the Indian country, he was ‘placed\r\n  under a strong guard, and by a military escort conveyed in chains\r\n  to the Supreme Court, Van Buren, Arkansas. The case being promptly\r\n  investigated, and there being no evidence upon which a bill of\r\n  indictment could be found, he was liberated on the 13th instant.\r\n  Brother Pratt, being without arms, and without friends to protect\r\n  him, and knowing that M‘Lean was thirsting for his blood, and that\r\n  he had the aid of a mass of the corrupt, money-bought citizens of\r\n  Van Buren, endeavored to make his escape on horseback, unmolested;\r\n  but every road and passway being under strict watch, he did not\r\n  succeed in getting far till his path was discovered. M‘Lean and half\r\n  a dozen other armed fiends pursued him; and Brother Pratt being\r\n  totally unarmed, they succeeded in killing him without being hurt.\r\n  Two of the party in advance intercepted his road, and brought him\r\n  to a halt, while M‘Lean and the others came up in the rear. M‘Lean\r\n  discharged a six-shooter at him, but the balls took no effect: some\r\n  passed through his clothes, others lodged in his saddle. The parties\r\n  now being in immediate contact, M‘Lean stabbed him (both being on\r\n  horseback) with a heavy bowie-knife twice under the left arm. Brother\r\n  Pratt dropped from his horse, and M‘Lean dismounted, and probed the\r\n  fatal wounds still deeper; he then got a Derringer from one of his\r\n  aids, and, as Brother Pratt lay dying upon his back, shot him in the\r\n  upper part of the breast, dropping the pistol by the side of the\r\n  victim. The assassin then mounted his horse and fled. This occurred\r\n  within a few steps of the residence of a farmer by the name of Wire.\r\n  Two gentlemen, being at the house at the time, saw the whole affair,\r\n  and have made oath to what they witnessed before a coroner’s jury.\r\n  Brother Pratt survived the work of this assassin two hours and a\r\n  half, and was enabled to tell those who came to his assistance who\r\n  he was, that he had been murdered by a fiend for doing his duty,\r\n  and gave full instructions as to what course should be pursued in\r\n  interring his body, and the disposition of the means and property\r\n  connected with his person. His instructions were fully attended to\r\n  by Elder Higginson and Mrs. M‘Lean, who reached the place of his\r\n  assassination the same evening. Those who saw his last moments state\r\n  that Brother Pratt died without a murmur or a groan, and apparently\r\n  without a pain, perfectly resigned to the will of Heaven. Brother\r\n  Pratt told Elder Higginson, the morning after his arrest, that his\r\n  enemies would kill him, and requested Elder Higginson to go through\r\n  with this spring’s emigration to Utah, and carry the news of his\r\n  death to the Church and his family. This Elder Higginson will do,\r\n  the Lord helping. After perpetrating this heaven-daring deed, M‘Lean\r\n  returned to Van Buren and made it known. After remaining in town\r\n  several hours, and walking the streets with impunity, he was escorted\r\n  by a number of citizens of Van Buren to the boat, and took his leave\r\n  of the place. Verily we had long thought that the bloodthirsty\r\n  mobocrats of Missouri and Illinois were without a parallel in the\r\n  world, but we now yield the palm to the Church-going citizens of\r\n  Van Buren, for they have proven to the world that they are a den of\r\n  murderers and assassins.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE HIGGINSON.\r\n  GEORGE CROUCH.’”\r\n\r\n  [192] On this occasion, Cedar Fort, a neighboring settlement, with\r\n  cultivation, and a few huts, near Camp Floyd, was attacked at night\r\n  by camp-followers (soldiers); a single calf was killed (the whole\r\n  place was burned to the ground), and the damages speedily rose from a\r\n  dozen to $10,000, claimed from Congress (which did not half repay the\r\n  injury done).\r\n\r\nStrongly disclaiming the idea that the officers who discussed with me\r\nthe subject at Camp Floyd had any tendency to exaggeration or to set\r\ndown aught in malice, and quite conscious, as they never failed to\r\nremark, that a stranger is allowed to see only the _beau côté_ of the\r\nNew Faith, I can not but think that their views are greatly warped by\r\ncauses external to it. This is to be expected. Who, after the massacre\r\nof Cawnpore, would have admitted into his mind a shadow of excuse for\r\nNana Sahib? Among so many, however blinded and fanatic, and however\r\nfond of polygamy--this is ever the first reproach--there must be some\r\ngood men. Yet from the “chief impostor” to the last “acolyte,” all\r\nare represented to be a gang of miscreants. The Mormons are far more\r\ntolerant; they have praise for those Gentiles, even federal officers,\r\nwho have abstained from injuring them. They speak well of Lieutenant\r\nColonel E. J. Steptoe, 9th Regiment of Infantry, and the officers of\r\nhis force;[193] of General Wilson, afterward the Navy Agent at San\r\nFrancisco; and of the present commandant, Colonel Cooke. They have\r\nnothing to say against Judge Reed, or Mr. John J. Kinney, the Chief\r\nJustice of the Supreme Court; and when Judge Leonidas Shaver died\r\nin 1855, they put the papers in mourning, and buried the Gentile in\r\ntheir cemetery. They do not abuse even their merchant rivals. Mr. J.\r\nB. Kimball, to mention no other, is generally praised and trusted.\r\nBut when they find it necessary or advisable to take away a man’s\r\ncharacter, they can do it, “and no mistake.” At the same time, their\r\ntolerance and discipline are, to say the least, remarkable. Judge\r\nBrocchus,[194] to quote but one, would run the risk of being torn to\r\npieces in almost any fanatical meeting in Europe.\r\n\r\n  [193] Mr. Hyde (chap. vi.) gives the official document in which these\r\n  officers petitioned President Pierce to reappoint Mr. Brigham Young\r\n  as Governor and Superintendent of Indian Affairs in Utah Territory,\r\n  and it speaks volumes in praise of the much-abused Saints.\r\n\r\n  [194] Chap. vi.\r\n\r\n[“BOSTON.”]\r\n\r\nAt Camp Floyd I was introduced to Colonel G. H. Crossman, Department\r\nQuarter-master General, and Major Montgomery of the same department; to\r\nDr. Porter, who was uncommonly and unnecessarily shy upon the subject\r\nof a “sick certificate;” and to Lieutenant N. A. M. Dudley, when we\r\npassed many a merry time over “simpkin.” It is hardly necessary to say\r\nthat the judge, having no authority to demand, did not obtain either\r\nescort or carriage. Colonel Cooke frankly told him that he had neither\r\nmen nor conveyance at liberty, and even if they were that he could not\r\nexceed orders. The Secretary of War is ready to “be down” upon such\r\noffenses, and in the United States Army probably more officers throw\r\nup the service from distress for leave than in the English army. It was\r\nclear that we must travel without the dignities, so we inspected an\r\nambulance and a four-mule team, for which the Hungarian refugee, its\r\nowner, asked $1000--but little beyond its worth. After an exceedingly\r\nsatisfactory day in a private sense, I passed the evening at Captain\r\nGove’s, and watched with astonishment the game of Boston. Invented by\r\nthe French prisoners in the islands of the American Liverpool, and\r\nabounding in “grand misery,” “little misery,” and other appropriate\r\nterms, it combines all the difficulties of whist, écarté, piquet, brag,\r\nand cribbage, and seems to possess the same attractions which beam\r\nupon the mind of the advanced algebraic scholar. Fortunately there was\r\nan abundance of good commissariat whisky and excellent tobacco, whose\r\nattractions were greater than that of Boston. On the morrow, a gloomy\r\nmorning, with cold blasts and spatters of rain from the southwest, and\r\nthe tameness of the snow-birds--which here represent\r\n\r\n    “Cock Robin and Jenny Wren,\r\n    God Almighty’s cock and hen”--\r\n\r\nwarned us that the fine season was breaking up, and that we had no time\r\nto lose. So, inspanning Julia and Sally, we set out, and after six\r\nhours reached once more the City of the Saints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nExcursions continued.\r\n\r\n\r\n[COTTON-WOOD KANYON.]\r\n\r\nI had long been anxious to visit the little chain of lakes in the\r\nWasach Mountains, southeast of the city, and the spot where the\r\nSaints celebrate their “Great Twenty-fourth of July.” At dinner the\r\nsubject had been often on the carpet, and anti-Mormons had informed\r\nme, hinting at the presence of gold, that no Gentile was allowed to\r\nenter Cotton-wood Kanyon without a written permit from the President\r\nProphet. Through my friend the elder I easily obtained the sign manual;\r\nit was explained to me that the danger of fires in a place which will\r\nsupply the city with lumber for a generation, and the mischievousness\r\nof enemies, were at the bottom of the precaution. Before starting,\r\nhowever, two Saints were chosen to accompany me, Mr. S----, and Mr.,\r\nor rather Colonel, Feramorz, popularly called Ferry, Little. This\r\ngentleman, a partner, relative, and connection of Mr. Brigham Young, is\r\none of the “Seventies;” of small and spare person, he is remarkable for\r\npluck and hardihood, and in conjunction with Ephe Hanks, the Danite, he\r\nhas seen curious things on the Prairies.\r\n\r\nA skittish, unbroken, stunted, weedy three-year-old for myself, and a\r\ntall mule for my companion, were readily lent by Mr. Kennedy, an Irish\r\nGentile and stock-dealer, who, being bound on business to California,\r\nwas in treaty with us for reward in case of safe-conduct. We chose the\r\nmorning of the 14th of September, after the first snow had whitened\r\nthe peaks, and a glorious cool, clear day it was--a sky diaphanous, as\r\nif earth had been roofed with rock crystal. While awaiting the hour to\r\ndepart under the veranda of the hotel, Governor Cumming pointed out to\r\nme Bill Hickman, once the second of the great “Danite” triumvirate,\r\nand now somewhat notorious for meddling with Church property. He is a\r\ngood-looking fellow, about forty-five, rather stout and square, with\r\nhigh forehead, open countenance, and mild, light blue eye, and owns, I\r\nbelieve, to only three deaths. On the last Christmas-day, upon occasion\r\nof a difficulty with a youth named Lot Huntingdon, the head of the\r\nyoungster party, he had drawn his “bowie,” and a “shooting” took place,\r\nboth combatants exchanging contents of revolvers across the street,\r\nboth being well filled with slugs, and both living to tell the tale.\r\n\r\n“Do you know what that fellow is saying to himself?” asked the\r\ngovernor, reading the thoughts of a fiercely frowning youth who\r\nswaggered past us.\r\n\r\nI confessed to the negative.\r\n\r\n“He is only thinking, ‘D--d gov’rnor, wonder if he’s a better man than\r\nme,’” said my interlocutor.\r\n\r\nAbout 4 P.M. we mounted and rode out of the city toward the mouth\r\nof the kanyon, where we were to meet Mr. Little. Passing by the\r\nsugar-mills and turning eastward, after five or six miles we saw at a\r\ndistance a block of buildings, which presently, as if by enchantment,\r\nsank into the earth; an imperceptible wave of ground--a common\r\nprairie formation--had intervened. From the summit of the land we\r\nagain sighted the establishment. It is situated in the broad bed of\r\na dry _fiumara_--which would, by-the-by, be a perilous place in the\r\ntropics--issuing from Parley’s Kanyon. The ravine, which is sometimes\r\npracticed by emigrant trains, is a dangerous pass, here and there but a\r\nfew rods wide, and hemmed in by rocks rising perpendicularly 2000 feet.\r\nThe principal house was built for defense, the garden was walled round,\r\nand the inclosure had but two small doors.\r\n\r\nWe were met at the entrance by Mr. Little, who, while supper was being\r\nprepared, led us to the tannery and the grist-mill, of which he is\r\npart proprietor. The bark used for the process is the red fir, costing\r\n$25 per cord, and the refuse is employed in composts. The hides are\r\nreceived unsalted; to save labor, they are pegged to soak upon wheels\r\nturned by water-power. The leather is good, and under experienced\r\nEuropean workmen will presently become cheaper than that imported from\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nBeyond the tannery was an adobe manufacture. The brick in this part\r\nsplits while burning, consequently the sun-dried article is preferred;\r\nwhen the wall is to be faced, pegs are driven into it to hold the\r\nplaster. The material is clay or silt from the creek, puddled with\r\nwater, and if saltish it is better than sweet soil; unity of color\r\nand formation are the tests of goodness. Each brick weighs, when dry,\r\n16 lbs., and the mould is mostly double. On the day after making they\r\nare stacked, and allowed to stand for two months; the season is June,\r\nJuly, and August, after which it becomes too cold. The workman is paid\r\n75 per cent.; 400 per diem would be tolerable, 700 good work; thus an\r\nable-bodied bricklayer can make twenty-one shillings a day--rather a\r\ncontrast to the wages of an unfortunate laborer in England.\r\n\r\n[EVERY CHILD A RELATIVE.]\r\n\r\nReturning home, we walked through Mr. Little’s garden, and admired\r\nits neatness. The fruit-trees were mostly barren; in this year the\r\ncity sets down a loss of $100,000 by frost. I tasted, for the first\r\ntime, the Californian grape, “uvas admodum maturas, ita voluit anni\r\nintemperies;” they not a little resembled the northern French. A\r\nsingle vine sometimes bears $100 worth. There was a little rhubarb,\r\nbut it is not much used where sugar costs forty-five cents per pound.\r\nAfter supping with Mr. Little, his wife and family, we returned to the\r\n_andronitis_, and prepared for the night with a chat. The principal\r\npoint illustrated was the curious amount of connection caused by\r\npolygamy; all men, calling each other brothers, become cousins, and\r\nit is hardly possible, among the old Mormons, to stop a child in the\r\nstreet without finding that it is a relative. I was surprised at the\r\ncomfort, even the luxury, of a Mormon householder in these remote\r\nwilds, and left it with a most favorable impression.\r\n\r\nAt the dawn of the next day we prepared to set out; from the city\r\nto the mouth of the kanyon the distance is about thirteen, and to\r\nthe lakelets twenty-seven miles. Mr. Little now accompanied us on\r\nhorseback, and his son James, whom I may here safely call a boy, was\r\ndriving a buck-board. This article is a light gig-body mounted upon\r\na thin planking, to which luggage is strapped; it can go where a\r\nhorse can tread, and is easier to both animals than riding down steep\r\nhills. The boy, like Mormon juveniles generally, had a great aptitude\r\nat driving, riding, and using the axe; he attended a school, but\r\ninfinitely preferred that of Nature, and showed all the disposition\r\nto become the father of a stout, brave Western man. As in the wilder\r\nparts of Australia, where the pedagogue has less pay than the shepherd,\r\n“keep a school” is here equivalent to semi-starvation; there is no\r\nsuperstitious aversion, as the Gentiles have asserted, to a modicum of\r\neducation, but the state of life renders manual labor more honored and\r\nprofitable. While the schoolmaster gains $2 50 per mensem, a ditcher\r\nwould make the same sum per diem. Besides impatience of study, the boys\r\nare ever anxious to become men--“bring up a child and away it goes,”\r\nsays the local proverb--and literature will not yet enable a youth to\r\nmarry and to set up housekeeping in the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nOur route lay over the bench; on our right was a square adobe fort,\r\nthat had been used during the Indian troubles, and fields and houses\r\nwere scattered about. Passing the mouth of Parley’s Kanyon, we\r\nentered the rich bottom-land of the Great Cotton-wood, beautified\r\nwith groves of quaking asp, whose foliage was absolute green, set off\r\nby paper-white stems. After passing through an avenue of hardheads,\r\n_i.e._, erratic granite boulders, which are carted to the city for\r\nbuilding the Temple, we turned to the left and entered the mouth of the\r\nkanyon, where its sides flare out into gentler slopes.\r\n\r\nA clear mountain stream breaks down the middle. The bed is a mass of\r\npebbles and blocks: hornblende; a white limestone, almost marble, but\r\nfull of flaws; red sandstone, greenstone, and a conglomerate like\r\nmosaic-work. The bank is thick with the poplar, from which it derives\r\nits name; willow clumps; the alder, with its dry, mulberry-like fruit;\r\nthe hop vine, and a birch whose bark is red as the cherry-tree’s.\r\nAbove the stream the ravine sides are in places too steep for growth;\r\nas a rule, the northern is never wooded save where the narrowness of\r\nthe gorge impedes the action of the violent south winds. On the lower\r\nbanks the timber is mostly cleared off. Upon the higher slopes grow\r\nthe mountain mahogany and the scrub maple wherever there is a foot of\r\nsoil. There is a fine, sturdy growth of abies. The spruce, or white\r\npine, rises in a beautifully regular cone often 100 feet high; there\r\nare two principal varieties of fir, one with smooth light bark, and the\r\nother, which loves a higher range, and looks black as it bristles out\r\nof its snowy bed, is of a dun russet. Already appeared the splendid\r\ntints which make the American autumn a fit subject “_pictoribus atque\r\npoetis_.” An atmosphere of blue seemed to invest the pines; the maple\r\nblushed bright red; and the willow clumps of the bed and the tapestry\r\nof ferns had turned to vegetable gold, while snow, bleached to more\r\nthan usual whiteness by intervals of deep black soil, flecked the\r\nvarious shade of the poison hemlocks and balsam firs, and the wild\r\nstrawberry, which the birds had stripped of fruit.\r\n\r\n[GREAT COTTON-WOOD KANYON.]\r\n\r\nGreat Cotton-wood Kanyon, like the generality of these ravines in\r\nthe western wall of the Wasach, runs east and west till near the\r\nhead, when it gently curves toward the north, and is separated from\r\nits neighbor by a narrow divide. On both sides the continuity of the\r\ngap is cut by deep jagged gullies, rendering it impossible to crown\r\nthe heights. The road, which winds from side to side, was worked by\r\nthirty-two men, directed by Mr. Little, in one season, at a total\r\nexpense of $16,000. After exhausting Red Buttes, Emigration, and other\r\nkanyons, for timber and fuel, Great Cotton-wood was explored in 1854,\r\nand in 1856 the ascent was made practicable. In places where the gorge\r\nnarrows to a gut there were great difficulties, but rocks were removed,\r\nwhile tree-trunks and boughs were spread like a corduroy, and covered\r\nover with earth brought from a distance: Mormon energy overcame every\r\nobstacle. It is repaired every summer before the anniversary festival;\r\nit suffers during the autumn, and is preserved from destruction by\r\nthe winter snows. In many places there are wooden bridges, one of\r\nwhich pays toll, and at the end of the season they become not a little\r\nrickety. As may be imagined, the water-power has been utilized. Lines\r\nand courses carefully leveled, and in parts deeply excavated, lest the\r\nprecious fluid should spread out in basins, are brought from afar, and\r\nprovided with water-gates and coffer-dams. The mills are named after\r\nthe letters C, B, A, D, and lastly E. Already 700,000 square feet of\r\nlumber have been cut during this summer, and a total of a million is\r\nexpected before the mills are snowed up; you come upon these ugly\r\nuseful erections suddenly, round a sharp turn in the bed; they have a\r\nqueer effect with their whirring saws and crash of timber, forming a\r\ntreble to the musical bass of the water-gods.\r\n\r\nWe halted at the several mills, when Mr. Little overlooked his\r\naccounts, and distributed stores of coffee, sugar, and tobacco. After\r\nthe first five miles we passed flecks of snow; the thermometer,\r\nhowever, in the shade never showed less than 60° F. In places the\r\nhill sides were bald from the effect of avalanches, and we saw where\r\na house had lately been swept away. In others a fine white limestone\r\nglistened its deception. After passing Mill D, we debouched upon the\r\nbasin also called the Big Prairie, a dwarf turfy savanna, about 100\r\nyards in diameter, rock and tree girt, and separated from Parley’s\r\nKanyon on the north by a tall, narrow wall. We then ascended a slope\r\nof black, viscid, slippery mud, in which our animals were nearly\r\nmired, with deep slush-holes and cross-roots: as we progressed the\r\nbridges did not improve. On our left, in a pretty grove of thin pines,\r\nstood a bear-trap. It was a dwarf hut, with one or two doors, which\r\nfall when Cuffy tugs the bait from the figure of 4 in the centre.\r\nThese mountaineers apparently ignore the simple plan of the Tchuvash,\r\nwho fill up with corn-brandy a hollow in some tree lying across\r\n“old Ephraim’s” path, and catch him dead drunk. In many places the\r\nquaking-asp trunks were deeply indented with claw-scars, showing that\r\nthe climbing species is here common. Shortly before, a bear had been\r\nshot within a few miles of Great Salt Lake City, and its paws appeared\r\nupon the hotel _table d’hôte_.\r\n\r\nAbout mid afternoon we dismounted, and left our nags and traps at Mill\r\nE, the highest point, where we were to pass the night. Mr. Little was\r\nsuffering from a severe neuralgia, yet he insisted upon accompanying\r\nus. With visions of Albano, Killarney, and Windermere, I walked up the\r\nhalf mile of hill separating us from Great Cotton-wood Lake. In front\r\nrose tall pine-clad and snow-strewed peaks, a _cul de sac_ formed by\r\nthe summit of the Wasach. We could not see their feet, but instinct\r\ntold me that they dropped around the water. The creek narrowed to a\r\njump. Presently we arrived at a kind of punch-bowl, formed by an\r\namphitheatre of frowning broken mountains, highest and most snowy on\r\nthe southeast and west, and nearly clear of snow and trees on the east.\r\nThe level ground, perhaps one mile in diameter, was a green sward,\r\ndotted with blocks and boulders, based on black humus and granite\r\ndetritus. Part of it was clear, the rest was ivy-grown, with pines,\r\nclumps, and circlets of tall trees, surrounded by their young in\r\nbunches and fringes, as if planted by the hand of man. There were signs\r\nof the last season’s revelry--heaps of charcoal and charred trunks,\r\nrough tables of two planks supported by trestles, chairs or rail-like\r\nsettles, and the brushy remnants of three “boweries.” Two skulls showed\r\nthat wolves had been busy with the cattle. Freshly-caught trout lay\r\nupon the table, preserved in snow, and in the distance the woodman’s\r\naxe awoke with artful sound the echoes of the rocks.\r\n\r\nAt last we came upon the little tarn which occupies the lowest angle,\r\nthe western ridge of the punch-bowl or prairie basin. Unknown to\r\nCaptain Stansbury, it had been visited of old by a few mountain-men,\r\nand since 1854 by the mass of the Mormons. According to my informants\r\nit is the largest of a chaplet of twelve pools, two to the S.W. and\r\nten to the S.E., which are probably independent bulges in the several\r\ntorrent beds. Some are described as having no outlet, yet all are\r\ndeclared to be sweet water. The altitude has not been ascertained\r\nscientifically. It is roughly set down between 9500 and 10,000 feet. It\r\nwas then at its smallest--about half a mile long by one quarter broad.\r\nAfter the melting of the snow it spreads out over the little savanna.\r\nThe bottom is sandy and gravelly, sloping from ten to twenty feet deep.\r\nIt freezes over in winter, and about 25-30 May the ice breaks up and\r\nsinks. The runnel which feeds it descends from the snow-capped peak to\r\nthe south, and copious supplies trickle through the soppy margin at the\r\nbase of the dripping hills around. The surplus escapes through a head\r\nto the north, where a gated dam is thrown across to raise the level,\r\nand to regulate the water-power. The color is a milky white; the water\r\nis warm, and its earthy vegetable taste, the effect of the weeds that\r\nmargin it, contrasts with the purity of the creek which drains it. The\r\nfish are principally mountain trout and the gymnotus eel. In search of\r\nshells we walked round the margin, now sinking in the peaty ground,\r\nthen clambering over the boulders--white stones that, rolled down from\r\nthe perpendicular rocks above, simulated snow--then fighting our way\r\nthrough the thick willow clumps. Our quest, however, was not rewarded.\r\nAfter satisfying curiosity, we descended by a short cut of a quarter\r\nof a mile under tall trees whose shade preserved the snow, and found\r\nourselves once more in Mill E.\r\n\r\n[FELLING TREES.]\r\n\r\nThe log hut was of the usual make. A cold wind--the mercury had\r\nfallen to 50° F.--rattled through the crannies, and we prepared for\r\na freezing night by a blazing fire. The furniture--two bunks, with\r\nbuffalo robes, tables and chairs, which were bits of plank mounted on\r\nfour legs--was of the rudest. I whiled away the last hours of light\r\nby adding to my various accomplishments an elementary knowledge of\r\nfelling trees. Handling the timber-axe is by no means so simple a\r\nprocess as it appears. The woodman does it by instinct; the tyro, who\r\nis always warned that he may easily indent or slice off a bit of his\r\nleg, progresses slowly and painfully. The principal art is to give the\r\nproper angle to the blade, to whirl the implement loosely round the\r\nhead, and to let it fall by the force of its own weight, the guiding\r\nhand gliding down the haft to the other, in order not to break the\r\nblow. We ate copiously; appetite appeared to come by eating, though not\r\nin the Parisian sense of the phrase--what a treasure would be such a\r\nsanitarium in India! The society was increased by two sawyers, gruff\r\nand rugged men, one of whom suffered from ophthalmia, and two boys, who\r\nsuccessfully imitated their elders.\r\n\r\n[INDEPENDENCE DAY.]\r\n\r\nOur fireside chat was sufficiently interesting. Mr. S---- described the\r\nceremonies of the last Mormon Independence Day. After the preliminaries\r\nhad been settled as below,[195] the caravans set out from the Holy\r\nCity. In 1860 there were 1122 souls, 56 carriages, 163 wagons, 235\r\nhorses, 159 mules, and 168 oxen. They bivouacked for the night upon\r\nthe road, and marched with a certain ceremony. The first President\r\nissued an order allowing any one to press forward, though not at the\r\nexpense of others; still no one would precede him; nor would the second\r\nadvance before the third President--a good example to some who might\r\nwant teaching. Moreover, the bishops had the privilege of inviting, or,\r\nrather, of permitting the people of their several wards, even Gentiles,\r\nto attend. The “pioneers”--the survivors of the noble 143 who, guided\r\nby their Joshua, Mr. Brigham Young, first attempted the Promised\r\nLand--were distinguished by their names on banners, and the bands\r\nplayed lustily “God save the King,” and the “Star-spangled Banner,”\r\n“Happy Land,” and “Du-dah.” At six on the fine morning of the 24th,\r\nwhich followed ugly weather, a salute of three guns, in honor of the\r\nFirst Presidency, was fired, with music in the intervals, the stars and\r\nthe stripes floating on the top of the noblest staff, a tall fir-tree.\r\nAt 9 A.M. a salute of thirteen guns, denoting the age of New Zion, and\r\nat 6 P.M. twelve guns, corresponding with the number of the apostles,\r\nwere discharged with similar ceremonies. The scene must have been\r\nlively and picturesque around the bright little tarn, and under the\r\neverlasting hills--a holiday crowd, with wagons and ambulances drawn\r\nup, tents and marquees pitched under the groves, and horse-races, in\r\nwhich the fair sex joined, over the soft green sward. At 10 P.M., after\r\nthe dancing in the boweries had flagged, the bands finished with “Home,\r\nsweet Home,” and the Saints returned to their every-day occupations.\r\n\r\n  [195] Extract from the Great Salt Lake correspondent of that amiable\r\n  and conscientious periodical, the “New York Herald.”\r\n\r\n  “_The Great Twenty-fourth of July._\r\n\r\n  “In my last I gave your readers a full account of the Mormon\r\n  demonstrations on the anniversary of American independence. That\r\n  done, they have now before them the celebration of their own\r\n  independence. Adhesiveness is largely developed in the Mormon\r\n  cranium. They will hold on to their notions. On the 24th of July,\r\n  1847, Brigham, at the head of the pioneers, entered this now\r\n  beautiful valley--then a barren wilderness. Forgetful of the means\r\n  that forced them here, the day was set apart for rejoicing. They laid\r\n  aside the weeds of mourning, and consecrated the day to feasting\r\n  and dancing. The Twenty-fourth is the day of deliverance that will\r\n  be handed down to generations when the Fourth is immeasurably\r\n  forgotten. Three years ago, two thousand persons were congregated\r\n  at the head-waters of Big Cotton-wood, commemorating independence,\r\n  when messengers from the East arrived with the intelligence that\r\n  the troops were on the plains. I need not farther allude to what\r\n  was then said and done; suffice it, things have been so disjointed\r\n  since that Big Cotton-wood has been left alone in solitude. Setting\r\n  aside the restraint of years, it seems that the faithful are to again\r\n  enjoy themselves. The following card tells the marching orders; the\r\n  interstices will be filled up with orations, songs, prayers, dances,\r\n  and every kind of athletic game that the young may choose to indulge\r\n  in:\r\n\r\n  “_Twenty-fourth of July at the Head-quarters of Big\r\n  Cotton-wood._--President Brigham Young respectfully invites ---- to\r\n  attend a picnic excursion to the lake in Big Cotton-wood Kanyon, on\r\n  Tuesday, the 24th of July.\r\n\r\n  “_Regulations._--You will be required to start so as to pass the\r\n  first mill, about four miles up the kanyon, before twelve o’clock\r\n  on Monday, the 23d, as no person will be allowed to pass that point\r\n  after two o’clock P.M. of that day. All persons are forbidden to\r\n  smoke segars or pipes, or kindle fires at any place in the kanyon,\r\n  except on the camp-ground. The bishops are requested to accompany\r\n  those invited from their respective wards, and see that each person\r\n  is well fitted for the trip with good, substantial, steady teams,\r\n  wagons, harness, hold-backs and locks, capable of completing the\r\n  journey without repair, and a good driver, so as not to endanger the\r\n  life of any individual. Bishops, heads of families, and leaders of\r\n  small parties will, before passing the first mill, furnish a full and\r\n  complete list of all persons accompanying them, and hand the same to\r\n  the guard at the gate.\r\n\r\n  “_Committee of Arrangements._--A. O. Smoot, John Sharp, L. W. Hardy,\r\n  A. Cunningham, E. F. Sheets, F. Kesler, Thomas Callister, A. H.\r\n  Raleigh, Henry Moon. J. C. Little, Marshal of the Day; Colonel R. T.\r\n  Burton will arrange the Guard.\r\n\r\n  “Great Salt Lake City, July 10, 1860.”\r\n\r\n[FREE-MASONRY.--MORALITY.--TOLERANCE.]\r\n\r\nMr. Little also recounted to us his experiences among the Indians, whom\r\nhe, like all the Mormons, firmly believed to be children of Israel\r\nunder a cloud. He compared the medicine lodge to a masonic hall, and\r\ndeclared that the so-called Red Men had signs and grips like ourselves;\r\nand he related how an old chief, when certain symbolic actions were\r\nmade to him, wept and wailed, thinking how he and his had neglected\r\ntheir observances. The Saints were at one time good masons; unhappily\r\nthey wanted to be better. The angel of the Lord brought to Mr. Joseph\r\nSmith the lost key-words of several degrees, which caused him, when he\r\nappeared among the brotherhood of Illinois, to “work right ahead” of\r\nthe highest, and to show them their ignorance of the greatest truths\r\nand benefits of masonry. The natural result was that their diploma\r\nwas taken from them by the Grand Lodge, and they are not admitted\r\nto a Gentile gathering. Now heathens without the gate, they still\r\ncling to their heresy, and declare that other masonry is, like the\r\nChristian faith, founded upon truth, and originally of the eternal\r\nChurch, but fallen away and far gone in error. There is no race,\r\nexcept perhaps antiquaries, more credulous than the brethren of the\r\nmystic craft. I have been told by one who may have deceived himself,\r\nbut would not have deceived me, that the Royal Arch, notoriously a\r\ncorruption of the Royal Arras, is known to the Bedouins of Arabia;\r\nwhile the dairy of the Neilgherry Todas, with its exclusion of women,\r\nand its rude ornamentation of crescents, circles, and triangles, was\r\nat once identified with the “old religion of the world whose vestiges\r\nsurvive among all people.” But these are themes unfit for an “entered\r\napprentice.” Mr. Little corroborated concerning the Prairie Indians\r\nand the Yutas what is said of the settled tribes, namely, that the\r\ncomforts of civilization tend to their destruction. The men, enervated\r\nby indoor life for half the year, are compelled at times to endure\r\nsudden privation, hardship, and fatigue, of which the results are\r\nrheumatism, consumption, and fatal catarrhs. Yet he believed that the\r\n“valleys of Ephraim” would yet be full of them. He spoke freely of the\r\nactualities and prospects of Mormonism. My companions asserted with\r\ntruth that there is not among their number a single loafer, rich or\r\npoor, an idle gentleman or a lazy vagabond, a drunkard or a gambler,\r\na beggar or a prostitute. Those honorable professions are membered by\r\nthe Gentiles. They boasted, indeed, of what is sometimes owned by their\r\nenemies, that there are fewer robberies, murders, arsons, and rapes in\r\nUtah than in any other place of equal population in the world. They\r\nheld that the laws of the United States are better adapted to secure\r\nthe happiness of a small community than to consolidate the provinces of\r\na continent into one huge empire, and they looked confidently forward\r\nto the spread of Mormonism over the world. They claimed for themselves,\r\nlike other secessionists, “_le droit sacré d’insurrection_,” against\r\nwhich in vain the Gentiles raged and the federal government devised\r\nvain things. They declared themselves to be the salt of the Union,\r\nand that in the fullness of time they shall break the republic in\r\npieces like a potter’s vessel. Of Washington, Jefferson, and the other\r\nsages of the Revolution they speak with all respect, describing them\r\nas instruments in the hand of the Almighty, and as Latter-Day Saints\r\nin will if not in deed. I was much pleased by their tolerance; but\r\ntolerance in the West is rather the effect of climate and occupation\r\nthan of the reasoning faculty. Gentiles have often said before me\r\nthat Mormonism is as good as any other religion, and that Mr. Joseph\r\nSmith “had as good a right to establish a Church as Luther, Calvin,\r\nFox, Wesley, or even bluff King Hal.” The Mormons are certainly the\r\nleast fanatical of our faiths, owning, like Hindoos, that every man\r\nshould walk his own way, while claiming for themselves superiority in\r\nbelief and politics. At Nauvoo they are said to have been puffed up\r\nby the rapid growth of their power, and to have been presumptuous,\r\nhaughty, insolent, and overbearing; to have assumed a jurisdiction\r\nindependent of, and sometimes hostile to, the nine counties around them\r\nand to the States; to have attached penalties to speaking evil of the\r\nProphet; and to have denied the validity of legal documents, unless\r\ncountersigned by him who was also mayor and general. They are certainly\r\nchanged for the better in these days. With respect to their future\r\nviews, the anti-Mormons assert that Saints have now been driven to the\r\nend of their tether, and must stand to fight or deliver; that the new\r\nTerritory of Nevada will presently be a fatal rival to them; that the\r\nStates will no longer tolerate this theocratic despotism in the bosom\r\nof a democracy; and that presently they must be wiped out. The Mormons\r\nalready discern the dawning of a brighter day. In the reaction which\r\nhas taken place in their favor they fear no organized attack by the\r\nUnited States on account of lobby influence at Washington, and the\r\n_vis inertiæ_ inherent in so slow and unwieldy a body as the federal\r\ngovernment. They count upon secession, quoting a certain proverb\r\ntouching conjunctures when honest men come in. They believe that the\r\nsupernatural aid of God, plus their vote, will presently make them a\r\nstate. “Some time this side of the great millennium” they will realize\r\ntheir favorite dream, restoration (which might indeed happen in ten\r\nyears) to their quondam Zion--Independence, Mo., the centre of the old\r\nterrestrial Paradise. Of this promised land their President said, with\r\n“something of prophetic strain,” “while water runs and grass grows,\r\nwhile virtue is lovely and vice hateful, and while a stone points out\r\na sacred spot where a fragment of American liberty once was”--Lord\r\nMacaulay’s well-known Zealander shall apparently take his passage by\r\nCunard’s--“I or my posterity will plead the cause of injured innocence,\r\nuntil Missouri makes atonement for all her sins, or sinks disgraced,\r\ndegraded, and damned to hell, where the worm dieth not, and the fire is\r\nnot quenched.” Then shall the Jews of the Old World rebuild the Temple\r\nof Solomon, and the Jews of the New World (the Mormons) recover their\r\nown Zion. Gog and Magog--that is to say, the kings of the Gentiles--and\r\ntheir hosts shall rise up against the Latter-Day Saints, who, guided\r\nby a prophet that wields the sword of Laban, shall mightily overthrow\r\nthem at the battle of Armageddon. Then the spears, bows, and arrows\r\n(probably an abstruse allusion to the descendants of our Miniés and\r\nArmstrongs) shall be burned with fire seven years; the earth and its\r\nfullness shall be theirs, and the long-looked-for millennium shall come\r\nat last. And as prophecy without date is somewhat liable to be vague\r\nand indefinite, these great events are fixed in Mr. Joseph Smith’s\r\nAutobiography for the year of grace 1890. Meantime they can retire, if\r\nforbidden the Saskatchewan River and Vancouver’s Island, to the rich\r\n“minerales” in “Sonora of the Gold Mountains.”\r\n\r\n[THE “GAUGE OF PHILOSOPHY.”--MISSIONARIES.]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the next day, Sunday, the 16th of September, we\r\nmounted and rode slowly on. I had neglected to take “leggins,” and\r\nthe loss of cuticle and cutis was deplorable. Once at the Tabernacle\r\nwas enough: on this occasion, however, non-attendance was a mistake.\r\nThere had been a little “miff” between Mr. President and the “Gauge\r\nof Philosophy,” Mr. O. Pratt. The latter gentleman, who is also an\r\napostle, is a highly though probably a self-educated man, not, as is\r\nstated in an English work, a graduate of Trinity College, Dublin. The\r\nUsman of the New Faith, writer, preacher, theologian, missionary,\r\nastronomer, philosopher, and mathematician--especially in the higher\r\nbranches--he has thrust thought into a faith of ceremony which is\r\nsupposed to dispense with the trouble of thinking, and has intruded\r\nhuman learning into a scheme whose essence is the utter abrogation of\r\nthe individual will. He is consequently suspected of too much learning;\r\nof relying, in fact, rather upon books and mortal paper than that royal\r\nroad to all knowledge, inspiration from on high, and his tendencies\r\nto let loose these pernicious doctrines often bring him into trouble\r\nand place him below his position. In his excellent discourse delivered\r\nto-day he had declared the poverty of the Mormons, and was speedily put\r\ndown by Mr. Brigham Young, who boasted the Saints to be the wealthiest\r\n(_i. e._, in good works and post-obit prospects) people in the world. I\r\nhad tried my best to have the pleasure of half an hour’s conversation\r\nwith the Gauge, who, however, for reasons unknown to me, declined. At\r\nthe same meeting Mr. Heber C. Kimball solemnly consigned to a hotter\r\nplace than the tropics Messrs. Bell and Livingston, the cause being\r\ntheir supposed complicity in bringing in the federal troops. I write\r\nit with regret, but both of these gentlemen, when the sad tidings were\r\ncommunicated to them, showed a quasi-Pharaonic hardening of the carnal\r\nheart. A measure, however, was on this occasion initiated, which more\r\nthan compensated for these small _ridicules_. To the present date\r\nmissionaries were sent forth, to Canton even, or Kurrachee, like the\r\napostles of Judea, working their passages and supporting themselves\r\nby handiwork; being wholly without purse or scrip, baggage or salary,\r\nthey left their business to languish, and their families to want. When\r\nman has no coin of his own, he is naturally disposed to put his hand\r\ninto his neighbor’s pocket, and the greediness of a few unprincipled\r\npropagandists, despite the prohibitions of the Prophet, had caused\r\na scandal by the richness of their “plunder.” A new ordinance was\r\ntherefore issued to the thirty new nominees.[196] The missionaries\r\nwere forbidden to take from their converts, and in compensation they\r\nwould receive regular salaries, for which funds were to be collected\r\nin the several wards. On the same evening I was informed a single\r\nward, the 13th, subscribed $3000. That Sunday was an important day to\r\nmyself also; I posted a “sick certificate,” advising extension of leave\r\nfor six months, signed by W. F. Anderson, M.D., of the University of\r\nMaryland. It was not wholly _en règle_; it required two signatures\r\nand the counter-signature of H. B. M.’s consul to affirm that the\r\nsignatures were _bonâ fide_, not “bogus.” But the signer was the\r\nonly M.D. in the place, H. B. M.’s nearest consul was distant about\r\n600 miles, and to suggest that a gentleman may be quietly forging or\r\nfalsifying his signature is to incur an unjustifiable personal risk in\r\nthe Far West.\r\n\r\n  [196] The following is a copy of the elder’s certificate, officially\r\n  signed by the president and his two councilors, and supplied to the\r\n  departing missionary:\r\n\r\n  “_To all Persons to whom this Letter shall come_:\r\n\r\n  “This certifies that the bearer, Elder A. B., is in full faith and\r\n  fellowship with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, and\r\n  by the general authorities of said Church has been duly appointed a\r\n  mission to Liverpool to preach the Gospel, and administer in all the\r\n  ordinances thereof pertaining to his office.\r\n\r\n  “And we invite all men to give heed to his teachings and counsels as\r\n  a man of God, sent to open to them the door of life and salvation,\r\n  and assist him in his travels, in whatsoever things he may need.\r\n\r\n  “And we pray God, the Eternal Father, to bless Elder A. B., and all\r\n  who receive him and minister to his comfort, with the blessings of\r\n  heaven and earth, for time and for all eternity, in the name of Jesus\r\n  Christ: Amen.\r\n\r\n  “Signed at Great Salt Lake City, Territory of Utah, ----, 186-, in\r\n  behalf of said Church.”\r\n\r\nStill bent upon collecting the shells of the Basin, I accepted Mr.\r\nS----’s offer of being my guide to Ensign Peak, where they are said\r\nto be found in the greatest number. Our route lay through the broken\r\nwall which once guarded the land against Lemuel, and we passed close\r\nby the large barn-like building called the Arsenal, where the military\r\nschool will also be. Motives of delicacy prevented my asking questions\r\nconcerning the furniture of the establishment. Anti-Mormons, however,\r\nwhisper that it contains cannon, mortars, and other large-scaled\r\nimplements of destruction, prepared, of course, for treasonable\r\npurposes. The Arsenal naturally led us into conversation concerning the\r\nNauvoo Legion, the Mormon Battalion, the Danite band, and other things\r\nmilitary, of which the reader may not be undesirous of knowing “some.”\r\n\r\n[THE NAUVOO LEGION.--GRANTS.]\r\n\r\nThe Nauvoo Legion was organized in 1840, and was made to include all\r\nmale Saints between the ages of sixteen and fifty. In 1842 it numbered\r\n2000 men, well officered, uniformed, armed, and drilled. It now may\r\namount throughout the Territory to 6000-8000 men: the Utah militia,\r\nhowever, is officially laid down in the latest returns at 2821. In case\r\nof war, it would be assisted by 30,000 or 40,000 Indian warriors. The\r\nLegion is commanded by a lieutenant general, at present Mr. Daniel C.\r\nWells, the Martin Hofer of this Western Tyrol; the major general is Mr.\r\nC. D. Grant, who, in case of vacancy, takes command. The lieutenant\r\ngeneral is elected by a majority of the commissioned officers, and\r\nis then commissioned by the governor: he organizes the Legion into\r\ndivisions, brigades, regiments, battalions, companies, and districts:\r\nhis staff, besides heads of departments--adjutant, commissary\r\nquarter-master, paymaster, and surgeon general--consists of three aids\r\nand two topographical engineers with the rank of colonel, a military\r\nsecretary with the rank of lieutenant colonel, and two chaplains. The\r\npresent adjutant general is Mr. William Ferguson, one of the few Irish\r\nSaints, originally sergeant-major in the Mormon battalion, who, after\r\nthe fashion of the Western world, combines with the soldier the lawyer\r\nand the editor. The minutest directions are issued to the Legion in\r\n“An Act to provide for the farther Organization of the Militia of the\r\nTerritory of Utah” (Territorial Laws, chap. 35), and it is divided into\r\nmilitary districts as below.[197] There is, moreover, an independent\r\nbattalion of Life Guards in Great Salt Lake County not attached to\r\nany brigade or division, but subject at all times to the call of the\r\ngovernor and lieutenant general. There are also minute-men, picked\r\nfighters, ready to mount, at a few minutes’ notice, upon horses that\r\nrange near the Jordan, and to take the field in pursuit of Indians or\r\nothers, under their commandant Colonel Burton. These corps form the\r\nnuclei of what will be, after two generations, formidable armies. The\r\nincrease of Saintly population is rapid, and from their childhood men\r\nare trained to arms: each adult has a rifle and a sabre, a revolver and\r\na bowie-knife, and he wants only practice to become a good, efficient,\r\nand well-disciplined soldier. Grants amounting to a total of $5000 have\r\nat different times been apportioned to military purposes, buildings,\r\nmounting ordnance, and schools: Gentiles declare that it was required\r\nfor education, but I presume that the Mormons, like most people, claim\r\nto know their own affairs best. As in the land of Liberty generally,\r\nthere is a modified conscription; “all free male citizens”--with a\r\nfew dignified exceptions and exempts--are subject to soldier’s duty\r\nwithin thirty days after their arrival at any military district in the\r\nTerritory.\r\n\r\n  [197] There are eleven originally established, viz.:\r\n\r\n  1st. The Great Salt Lake Military District shall include all the\r\n  militia within the boundaries of Great Salt Lake City.\r\n\r\n  2d. The Davis Military District shall include all the militia within\r\n  the limits of Davis County.\r\n\r\n  3d. The Weber Military District shall include all the militia within\r\n  the limits of Weber County.\r\n\r\n  4th. The Western Jordan Military District shall include all the\r\n  militia in Great Salt Lake County west of the Jordan River.\r\n\r\n  5th. The Tooele Military District shall include all the militia\r\n  within the limits of Tooele County.\r\n\r\n  6th. The Cotton-wood Military District shall include all the militia\r\n  in Great Salt Lake County south of the south line of Great Salt Lake\r\n  City and east of the Jordan River.\r\n\r\n  7th. The Utah Military District shall include all the militia in Utah\r\n  County.\r\n\r\n  8th. The San Pete Military District shall include all the militia\r\n  within the limits of San Pete County.\r\n\r\n  9th. The Parovan Military District shall include all the militia\r\n  within the limits of Millard County.\r\n\r\n  10th. The Iron Military District shall include all the militia within\r\n  the limits of Iron County.\r\n\r\n  11th. The Green River Military District shall include all the militia\r\n  within the limits of Green River County.\r\n\r\nThat the Mormon battalion did good service in the Mexican War of 1847\r\nis a matter of history. It was sent at a most critical conjuncture.\r\nApplication was made to the Saints, when upon the point of commencing\r\ntheir exodus from Egypt, through the deserts of Paran and Sin, where\r\nthe red Amalekite and the Moabite lay in wait to attack them, and\r\nwhen every male was wanted to defend the old and sick, the women and\r\nchildren, and the valuables of which the Egyptian had not despoiled\r\nthem. Yet the present Prophet did not hesitate to obey the call: he\r\nsent off 500 of his best men, who fought through the war and shared\r\nin the triumph. Providence rewarded them. It was a Mormon--James\r\nW. Marshall--who, when discharged from service, entered with some\r\ncomrades the service of a Swiss land-owner, Captain Suter--a remnant of\r\nCharles X.’s guard--near Sacramento, on the American River, and who,\r\nin January, 1848, when sinking a mill-run or water-run, discovered the\r\nshining metal which first made California a household word. On the\r\nreturn of the battalion to Great Salt Lake City, laden with nearly\r\nhalf a million of gold, a mint was established, and a $5 piece was\r\nadded to the one million dollars which forms the annual circulation of\r\nthe United States. It bears on the reverse, “Holiness to the Lord,”\r\nsurmounting a three-cornered cap, placed over a single eye: the former\r\nalludes, I was told, mystically to the first Presidency; the obverse\r\nhaving two hands clasped over the date (1849), and the words “Five\r\nDollars, G. S. L. C. P. G.” The $5 appeared somewhat heavier, though\r\nsmaller than an English sovereign. Anti-Mormons adduce this coinage as\r\nan additional proof of saintly presumption; but it was legally done:\r\na Territory may not stamp precious metal with the federal arms, but\r\nit has a right to establish its own. They adduce, moreover, a severe\r\ncharge, namely, that the $5 piece was 15-20 per cent. under weight, and\r\nyet was forcibly made current. One remarkable effect the gold certainly\r\nhad. When the Kirtland Safety Savings Bank, established by Mr. Joseph\r\nSmith in February, 1831, broke, he stout-heartedly prophesied that\r\nbefore twenty years should elapse the worthless paper should be again\r\nat par. The financial vaticination was true to the letter.[198]\r\n\r\n  [198] The Mormons quote two other prophecies both equally offensive\r\n  to the United States, and both equally well known.\r\n\r\n  On the 26th of April, 1843, Mr. Joseph Smith distinctly declared, in\r\n  the name of the Lord, that before the arrival of the Son of Man the\r\n  “question of slavery would cause a rebellion in South Carolina,” and\r\n  effect a “division of the Southern against the Northern States.” It\r\n  was a calamity easy to be foreseen, but we look with anxiety to the\r\n  unfulfilled portion, the “terrible bloodshed” which will result.\r\n\r\n  In 1846, when, humanly speaking, want and destitution stared the\r\n  Saints in the face, Mr. Brigham Young predicted that within five\r\n  years they would be wealthier than before. This was palpably\r\n  fulfilled in 1849, when the passage of emigrants to California\r\n  enabled the Saints to exchange their supplies of food for goods and\r\n  valuables at enormous profits.\r\n\r\n  I commend these “uninspired prophecies” to the simple-minded\r\n  translator of “Forewarnings, Prophecies on the Church, Antichrist\r\n  (who was born, we are told, four years ago), and Revelations in\r\n  the Last Times.” Messrs. Smith and Young’s vaticinations will be\r\n  found quite as respectable as the “Visions of an Aged Nun” and the\r\n  “Predictions of Sister Rosa Columba.” Prophecy, being the highest aim\r\n  of human induction, is apparently universally and equally diffused.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENSIGN PEAK. (North End of Great Salt Lake City.)]\r\n\r\n[THE DANITE BAND.]\r\n\r\nThe “Danite band,” a name of fear in the Mississippi Valley, is said\r\nby anti-Mormons to consist of men between the ages of seventeen and\r\nforty-nine. They were originally termed Daughters of Gideon, Destroying\r\nAngels--the Gentiles say Devils--and, finally, Sons of Dan, or Danites,\r\nfrom one of whom it was prophesied that he should be a serpent in the\r\npath. They were organized about 1837, under D. W. Patten, popularly\r\ncalled Captain Fearnot, for the purpose of dealing as avengers of\r\nblood with Gentiles; in fact, they formed a kind of “Death Society,”\r\nDesperadoes, Thugs, Hashshashiyun--in plain English, assassins in\r\nthe name of the Lord. The Mormons declare categorically the whole\r\nand every particular to be the calumnious invention of the impostor\r\nand arch apostate Mr. John C. Bennett, whilom mayor of Nauvoo; that\r\nthe mystery and horror of the idea made it equally grateful to the\r\nknave and fool who persecuted them, and that not a trader could be\r\nscalped, nor a horse-stealer shot, nor a notorious villain of a Gentile\r\nknived without the deed of blood being attributed to Danite hands\r\ndirected by prophetic heads. It was supposed that the Danites assume\r\nsavage disguises: “he has met the Indians” was a proverbial phrase,\r\nmeaning that a Gentile has fallen into the power of the destroying\r\nangels. I but express the opinion of sensible and moderate neutrals\r\nin disbelieving the existence of an organized band of “Fidawi;” where\r\nevery man is ready to be a Danite, Danites are not wanting. Certainly,\r\nin the terrible times of Missouri and Illinois, destroying angels were\r\nrequired to smite secretly, mysteriously, and terribly the first-born\r\nof Egypt; now the necessity has vanished. This, however, the Mormons\r\ndeny, declaring the existence of the Danites, like that of spiritual\r\nwives, to be, and ever to have been, literally and in substance totally\r\nand entirely untrue.\r\n\r\n[THE JEBEL NUR.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile we had nearly ascended the Jebel Nur of this new Meccah, the\r\nbig toe of the Wasach Mountains, and exchanged the sunny temperature\r\nbelow for a cold westerly wind, that made us feel snow: the air\r\nimproved in purity, as we could judge by the effects of carcasses\r\nlying at different heights. The bench up which we trod was gashed by\r\nbroad ravines, and bore upon its red soil a growth of thin sage and\r\nsunflower. A single fossil and two varieties of shells were found: iron\r\nand quartz were scattered over the surface, and there is a legend of\r\ngold having been discovered here. Presently, standing upon the topmost\r\nbluff, we sat down to enjoy a view which I have attempted to reproduce\r\nin a sketch. Below the bench lay the dot-like houses of Zion. We could\r\nsee with bird’s-eye glance the city laid out like a chess-board, and\r\nall the length and breadth of its bee-line streets and crow-flight\r\navenues, which, bordered by distance-dwarfed trees, narrowed to threads\r\nas they drew toward a vanishing point. Beyond the suburbs stretched the\r\nvalley plain, sprinkled with little plantations clustering round the\r\nsmaller settlements, and streaked by the rivulets which, arising from\r\nthe frowning pine-clad heights on the left, flowed toward the little\r\nJordan of this young Judea on the right. The extreme south was bounded\r\nby the denticulated bench which divided like a mole the valleys of the\r\nGreat Salt and Utah Lakes. Already autumn had begun: the purpling plain\r\nand golden slopes shed a dying glory over the departing year, while the\r\nmellowing light of evening, and aerial blue from above, toned down to\r\nabsolute beauty each harsher feature of the scene.\r\n\r\nAfter lingering for a while over the fair _coup d’œil_, we descended,\r\nholding firm the sage-bushes, the abrupt western slope, and we passed\r\nby the warm Harrowgate spring, with its sulphury blue waters, white\r\nlime-like bed, and rushy margins in dark earth, snow-capped with\r\nsalt efflorescence. As we entered the city we met a noted Gentile\r\ninnocently driving out a fair Saint: both averted their faces as they\r\npassed us, but my companion’s color darkened. All races have their\r\npet prohibitions and aversions, their likes and dislikes in matters\r\nof sin. Among the Mormons, a suspicion of immorality is more hateful\r\nthan the reputation of bloodshed. So horse-thieving in the Western\r\nStates is a higher crime than any other--in fact, the sin which is\r\nnever forgiven. An editor thus unconcernedly sums up the history of one\r\nlately shot when plundering stock: “He was buried by those who meted\r\nout to him summary justice, not exactly attending to law, but upon a\r\nmore speedy, economical, and salutary principle, and a stake was placed\r\nat the head of his grave, on which was inscribed ‘A. B. B----, shot for\r\nhorse-stealing, July 1, 1860.’”\r\n\r\nEntering the city by the northwest, we passed the Academy of the 7th\r\nWard. Standing in a 10-acre block, it is a large adobe building with\r\nsix windows, built for a hotel, and bought for educational purposes by\r\nthe Prophet. Forms and tables, scattered with the usual school-books,\r\nwere the sole furniture, and the doors were left open as if they had\r\nnothing to defend. My companion had a truly brotherly way of treating\r\nhis co-religionists; he never met one, however surly-looking, without\r\na salute, and when a door was opened he usually walked in. Thus we\r\nvisited successively a water-power-mill, a tannery, and an English\r\ncoachmaker, painter, and varnisher. Some of the houses which we\r\npassed were neat and cleanly curtained, especially that belonging to\r\nan Englishwoman whose husband, Captain R----, had lately left her\r\nin widowhood. We finished with the garden of Apostle Woodruff, who\r\nintroduced us to his wife, and showed us work of which he had reason\r\nto be proud. Despite the hard, ungrateful soil which had required\r\nirrigation for the last ten years, there were apricots from Malta,\r\nthe Hooker strawberries, here worth $5 the plant, plum-trees from\r\nKew Gardens, French and Californian grapes, wild plum and buffalo\r\nberry, black currants, peaches, and apples--with which last we were\r\nhospitably loaded--in numbers. The kitchen garden contained rhubarb,\r\npeas, potatoes, Irish and sweet, asparagus, white and yellow carrots,\r\ncabbages, and huge beets: the sugar-cane had been tried there, but it\r\nwas not, like the sweet holcus, a success.\r\n\r\n[CEMETERY.]\r\n\r\nThe last time I walked out of Great Salt Lake City was to see the\r\ncemetery, which lies on the bench to the northeast of the settlement.\r\nThere is but one cemetery for saint and sinner, and it has been\r\nprudently removed about three miles from the abodes of the living.\r\nThe tombs, like the funeral ceremonies, are simple, lacking the\r\n“monumental mockery” which renders the country church-yard in England a\r\nfitter study for farce than for elegy. On occasions of death, prayers\r\nare offered in the house, and the corpse is carried at once to its\r\nlast home. The grave-yard is walled round, and contains a number of\r\noccupants, the tombs being denoted by a stone or board, with name and\r\ndate, and sometimes a religious sentence, at the head and foot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nLatter-Day Saints.--Of the Mormon Religion.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo less an authority than Alexander von Humboldt has characterized\r\npositive religions in general as consisting of an historical novelette\r\nmore or less interesting, a system of cosmogony more or less\r\nimprobable, and a code of morals mostly pure.[199] Two thirds of this\r\ndescription apply to the faith of the Latter-Day Saints: they have,\r\nhowever, escaped palæological criticism by adopting Genesitic history,\r\nand by “swallowing Eve’s apple” in the infancy of their spiritual life.\r\n\r\n  [199] A somewhat free version of “toutes les réligions positives\r\n  offrent trois parties distinctes; un traité de mœurs partout le\r\n  même et très pur, un rêve géologique, et un mythe ou petit roman\r\n  historique: le dernier élément obtient le plus d’importance.”--LX.\r\n  Letter, Dec. 3d, 1841.\r\n\r\n[THE WORD “MORMON.”]\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to comment upon the New Dispensation--for such,\r\nthough not claiming or owning to be, it _is_--I may compare the two\r\nleading interpretations of the word “Mormon,” which, as has been\r\nwell remarked,[200] truly convey the widely diverging opinions of\r\nthe opposers and supporters of Mormonism. Mormon (μορμων) signifies\r\nliterally a lamia, a maniola, a female spectre; the mandrill, for its\r\nugliness, was called Cynocephalus mormon. “Mormon,” according to Mr.\r\nJoseph Smith’s Mormonic, or rather Pantagruelic interpretation, is the\r\nbest--_scil._, of mankind. “We say from the Saxon _good_, the Dane\r\n_god_, the Goth _goder_, the German _gut_, the Dutch _goed_, the Latin\r\n_bonus_, the Greek _kalos_, the Hebrew _tob_, and the Egyptian _mon_.\r\nHence, with the addition of More, or the contraction Mor, we have the\r\nword Mormon, which means literally “more good.” By faith it is said man\r\ncan remove mountains: perhaps it will also enable him to believe in\r\nthe spirit of that philology that revealed unto Mr. Joseph Smith his\r\nderivation, and rendered it a shibboleth to his followers. This is not\r\nthe place to discuss a subject so broad and so long, but perhaps--the\r\nidea will suggest itself--the mind of man most loves those errors and\r\ndelusions into which it has become self-persuaded, and is most fanatic\r\nconcerning the irrationalities and the supernaturalities to which it\r\nhas bowed its own reason.\r\n\r\n  [200] The Mormons, or Latter-Day Saints, by Lieutenant J. W.\r\n  Gunnison, of the United States Topographical Engineers. Philadelphia,\r\n  1852.\r\n\r\nUnaccountably enough, seeing that it means “more good,” _scil._, the\r\nbest of mankind, the word Mormon is distasteful to its disciples, who\r\nlook upon it as Jew by a Hebrew, Mohammedan by a Moslem, and Romanist\r\nor Puseyite by the sectarian Christian. They prefer to be called\r\nLatter-Day Saints, or, to give them their title in full, the Church\r\nof Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, in contradistinction to the\r\nFormer-Day Saints. Latter Day alludes to the long-looked-for convulsion\r\nthat will end the present quiescent geologic epoch. Its near approach\r\nhas ever been a favorite dogma and improvement subject of the Christian\r\nChurch, from the time of St. Paul to that of Mr. Joseph Smith, and Drs.\r\nWolff and Cumming;[201] for who, inquires Panurge, “is able to tell if\r\nthe world shall last yet three years?” Others read it as a prophecy\r\nthat “Gentilism,” alias “the corrupted Christianity of the age,” is\r\n“on its last legs.” Even as “Saints” is a term which has been applied\r\nfrom time immemorial in the Apocalypse and elsewhere to the orthodox,\r\n_i.e._, those of one’s own doxy, and as Enoch speaks of “saints”\r\nbefore the Flood or Noachian cataclysm, so the honorable title has in\r\nthese days been appropriated by seers, revelators, and prophets, and\r\nconferred upon the Lord’s chosen people, _i.e._, themselves and their\r\nfollowers. According to anti-Mormons, the name Latter-Day Saints was\r\nassumed in 1835 by the Mormons at the suggestion of Sidney Rigdon.\r\n\r\n  [201] The Mormon Prophet fixed “the end of the world” for A.D. 1890;\r\n  Dr. Cumming, I believe, in 1870.\r\n\r\n[THE MORMON ELEMENT.]\r\n\r\nBefore beginning a description of what Mormonism really is, I would\r\nsuccinctly lay down a few positions illustrating its genesis.\r\n\r\n1. The religious as well as the social history of the progressive\r\nAnglo-Saxon race is a succession of contrasts, a system of reactions;\r\nat times retrogressive, it has a general onward tendency toward an\r\nunknown development. The Unitarians of New England, for instance, arose\r\nout of Calvinism. The Puritanism of the present generation is the\r\nnatural consequence of the Rationalism which preceded it.\r\n\r\n[STATISTICS.]\r\n\r\n2. In what a French author terms “le triste état de dissolution dans\r\nlequel gît le Chrétienté de nos jours”--the splitting of the Church\r\ninto three grand divisions, Roman, Greek, and Eastern, the convulsion\r\nof the Northern mind, which created Protestantism, and the minute\r\nsubdivision of the latter into Episcopalians and Presbyterians,\r\nLutherans and Calvinists, Quakers and Shakers, the multiform Methodists\r\nand various Baptists, and, to quote no farther _variétés des églises_,\r\nthe Congregationalists, Unitarians, and Universalists--a rationalistic\r\nrace finds reason to inquire, “What is Christianity?” and holds itself\r\nprepared for a new faith, a regeneration of human thought--in fact, a\r\nreligious and social change, such as the Reformation of the sixteenth\r\ncentury represented and fondly believed itself to be.[202]\r\n\r\n  [202]\r\n\r\n  _Religious Denominations in the United States, according to the\r\n  Census of 1861._\r\n\r\n  (From the “American Almanac” of 1861.)\r\n\r\n  +---------------+-------+----------+--------+-----------+--------+\r\n  |               |       |  Aggre-  |        |   Total   | Average|\r\n  |Denominations. | No. of|   gate   | Average|   Value   |  Value |\r\n  |               |Church-| Accommo- |Accommo-| of Church |of Prop-|\r\n  |               |  es.  |  dation. | dation.| Property. |  erty. |\r\n  +---------------+-------+----------+--------+-----------+--------+\r\n  |Baptist        |  8,791| 3,130,878|   356  |$10,931,382| $1,244 |\r\n  |Christian      |    812|   296,050|   365  |    845,810|  1,041 |\r\n  |Congregational |  1,674|   795,177|   475  |  7,973,962|  4,763 |\r\n  |Dutch Reformed |    324|   181,986|   561  |  4,096,730| 12,644 |\r\n  |Episcopal      |  1,422|   625,213|   440  | 11,261,970|  7,919 |\r\n  |Free           |    361|   108,605|   300  |    251,255|    698 |\r\n  |Friends        |    714|   282,823|   396  |  1,709,867|  2,395 |\r\n  |German Reformed|    327|   156,932|   479  |    965,880|  2,953 |\r\n  |Jewish         |     31|    16,575|   534  |    371,600| 11,987 |\r\n  |Lutheran       |  1,203|   531,100|   441  |  2,867,886|  2,383 |\r\n  |Mennonite      |    110|    29,900|   272  |     94,245|    856 |\r\n  |Methodist      | 12,487| 4,209,333|   337  | 14,636,671|  1,174 |\r\n  |Moravian       |    331|   112,185|   338  |    443,347|  1,339 |\r\n  |Presbyterian   |  4,584| 2,040,316|   445  | 14,369,889|  3,135 |\r\n  |Roman Catholic |  1,112|   620,950|   558  |  8,973,838|  8,069 |\r\n  |Swedenborgian  |     15|     5,070|   338  |    108,100|  7,206 |\r\n  |Tunker         |     52|    35,075|   674  |     46,025|    885 |\r\n  |Union          |    619|   213,552|   345  |    690,065|  1,114 |\r\n  |Unitarian      |    243|   137,367|   565  |  3,268,122| 13,449 |\r\n  |Universalist   |    494|   205,462|   415  |  1,766,015|  3,576 |\r\n  |Minor sects    |    325|   115,347|   354  |    741,980|  2,283 |\r\n  |               +-------+----------+--------+-----------+--------+\r\n  |    Total      | 36,011|13,849,896|   384  |$86,416,639| $2,400 |\r\n  +---------------+-------+----------+--------+-----------+--------+\r\n\r\n3. Mormonism boasts of few Roman Catholic or Greek converts; the French\r\nand Italians are rare, and there is a remarkable deficiency of Germans\r\nand Irish--those wretched races without nationality or loyalty--which\r\nhave overrun the Eastern American States. It is, then, to Protestantism\r\nthat we must look for the origin of the New Faith.\r\n\r\n4. In 1800-1804, and in 1820, a mighty Wesleyan “revival,” which\r\nin Methodism represents the missions and retreats of Catholicism,\r\nhad disturbed and excited the public mind in America, especially in\r\nKentucky and Tennessee. The founder of Mormonism, Mr. Joseph Smith,\r\nhis present successor, and his principal disciples and followers,\r\nwere Campbellites, Millerites, Ranters, or other Methodists. Wesleyan\r\nsectarianism, like the old Arab paganism in El Islam, still shows\r\nits traces in the worship and various observances of a doxology which\r\nby literalism and exaggeration has wholly separated itself from the\r\nolder creeds of the world. Thus we find Mormonism to be in its origin\r\nEnglish, Protestant, anti-Catholic, Methodistic.\r\n\r\n[HISTORY OF MORMONISM.]\r\n\r\nIt may be advisable briefly to trace the steps by which we arrive\r\nat this undesirable end. The birth of Romanism, according to the\r\nReformed writers, dates from certain edicts issued by Theodosius II.\r\nand by Valentinian III., and constituting the Bishop of Rome “Rector\r\nof the whole Church.” The newly-born hierarchy found tender nurses in\r\nJustinian, Pepin, and Charlemagne, and in the beginning of the eleventh\r\ncentury St. Gregory VII. (Hildebrand the Great) supplied the prime\r\nwant of the age by establishing a visible theocracy, with a vicar of\r\nJesus Christ at its head. To the existence of a mediatorial priestly\r\ncaste, the officials of a spiritual despotism, claiming power of\r\ncensure and excommunication, and the gift of the crown terrestrial as\r\nwell as celestial, anti-papistical writers trace the various vices and\r\ncorruptions inherent in a semi-barbarous age, the “melancholy duality”\r\nof faith and works of religion and morality which seems to belong to\r\nthe Southern mind, and the Oriental semi-Pelagianism which taught that\r\nman might be self-sanctified or vicariously saved, with its logical\r\ndeductions, penance, benefices, indulgences. An excessive superstition\r\nendured for a season. Then set in the inevitable reaction: the extreme\r\nreligiousness, that characteristic of the earnest quasi-pagan age of\r\nthe Christian Church, in the fullness of time fell into the opposite\r\nexcess, Rationalism and its natural consequences, infidelity and\r\nirreligion.\r\n\r\nReformers were not wanting before the Reformation. As early as 1170,\r\nPierre Vaud, or Valdo, of Lyons, sold off his merchandise, and\r\nappealing from popery to Scripture and to primitive Christianity,\r\nas, in a later day did Jeremy Bentham from St. Paul to his Master,\r\nattacked the Roman hierarchy. John Wicliffe (1310-1385) is claimed by\r\nhis countrymen to have originated the “liberal ideas” by which British\r\nProtestantism was matured; it is owned even by foreigners that he\r\ninfluenced opinion from Oxford to far Bohemia. He died peaceably, but\r\nthe Wicliffites, who presently were called Lollards--“tares” sown by\r\nthe fiend--though supported by the Commons against Henry IV. and his\r\nparty, the dignified clergy, suffered, until the repeal of the Act “de\r\nhæreticis comburendis,” the fiercest persecution. During the reign of\r\nHenry V. they gained strength, as the pronunciamento of 20,000 men in\r\nSt. Giles’s Fields under Sir John Oldcastle proves: the cruel death of\r\ntheir leader only served to strengthen them, supported as they were\r\nby the lower branch of the Legislature in their opposition to the\r\ncrown. On the Continent of Europe the great follower of Wicliffe was\r\nJohn Huss, who preached in Bohemia about a century before the days of\r\nLuther, and who, condemned by the Councils of Constance and Basle,\r\nperished at the stake in 1432. Jerome Savonarola, tortured and burnt\r\nin 1498, and other minor names, urged forward the fatal movement until\r\nthe Northern element once more prevailed, in things spiritual as in\r\nthings temporal, over the Southern; the rude and violent German again\r\nattacked the soft, sensuous Italian, and Martin Luther hatched the\r\negg which the schools of Rabelais and Erasmus had laid. It was the\r\nwork of rough-handed men; the reformer Zuingle emerged from an Alpine\r\nshepherd’s hut; Melancthon, the theologian, from an armorer’s shop,\r\nas Augustine, the monk, from the cottage of a poor miner. Such, in\r\nthe 16th century, on the Continent of Europe, were the prototypes and\r\npredecessors of Messrs. Joseph Smith, Oliver Cowdery, Sidney Rigdon,\r\nand Brigham Young, who arose nearly three centuries afterward in the\r\nNew World.\r\n\r\nIn England, when the unprincipled tyranny of Henry VIII. had\r\nestablished, by robbing and confiscating, hanging and quartering, that\r\n“reformed new-cast religion,” of which Sir Thomas Brown “disliked\r\nnothing but the name,” the bigotry of the ultra-reformatory school lost\r\nno time in proceeding to extremes. William Chillingworth, born A.D.\r\n1602, and alternately Protestant, Catholic, Socinian, and Protestant,\r\nput forth in his “Religion of Protestants a safe Way of Salvation,”\r\nthat Chillingworthi Novissima, “the Bible and nothing but the Bible.”\r\nThis dogma swept away ruthlessly all the cherished traditions of a past\r\nage--the ancient observed customs of the Church--all, in fact, that\r\ncan beautify and render venerable a faith, and substituted in their\r\nstead a bald Bibliolatry which at once justifies credulity and forbids\r\nit; which tantalizes man with the signs and wonders of antiquity, and\r\nyet which, with an unwise contradictoriness, forbids him to revise\r\nor restore them. And as each man became, by Bible-reading, his own\r\ninterpreter, with fullest right of private judgment, and without any\r\ninfallible guide--the inherent weakness of reformation--to direct him,\r\nthe broad and beaten highway of belief was at once cut up into a parcel\r\nof little footpaths which presently attained the extreme of divergence.\r\n\r\n[METHODISM.]\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest products of such “religious freedom” in England\r\nwas Methodism, so called from the Methodistic physicians at Rome. The\r\nfounder and arch-priest of the schism, the Rev. John Wesley, son of the\r\nRector of Epworth in Lincolnshire, and born in 1703, followed Luther,\r\nCalvin, and other creedmongers in acting upon his own speculation\r\nand peculiar opinions. One of his earliest disciples--only eleven\r\nyears younger than his master--was the equally celebrated George\r\nWhitfield, of Gloucester. Suffice it to remark, without dwelling\r\nupon their history, that both these religionists, and mostly the\r\nlatter, who died in 1770 at Newberry, New England, converted and\r\npreached to thousands in America, there establishing field-services\r\nand camp-meetings, revivals and conferences, which, like those of the\r\nFrench Convulsionists in the last century, galvanized Christianity\r\nwith a wild and feverish life. Falling among uneducated men, the\r\ndoctrine, both in England and the colonies, was received with a\r\nbewilderment of enthusiasm, and it soon produced the usual fruits of\r\nsuch phrensy--prophecies that fixed the end of the world for the 28th\r\nof February, 1763, miraculous discernment of angels and devils, mighty\r\ncomings of the power of God and outpourings of the Spirit, rhapsodies\r\nand prophecies, dreams and visions, accompanied by rollings, jerks,\r\nand barks, roarings and convulsions, syncope, catalepsy, and the other\r\nhysterical affections and obscure disorders of the brain, forming the\r\ncharacteristic symptoms of religious mania.\r\n\r\n[TRUE PROTESTANTS.]\r\n\r\nThus, out of the semi-barbarous superstitions of the Middle Ages,\r\nsucceeded by the revival of learning, which in the 15th century\r\nfollowed the dispersion of the wise men of the East from captured\r\nByzantium, proceeded “Protestant Rationalism,” a system which,\r\nadmitting the right of private judgment, protested against the\r\nreligion of Southern Europe becoming that of the whole world. From\r\nProtestantism sprung Methodism, which restored to man the grateful\r\nexercise of his credulity--a leading organ in the human brain--his\r\nbelief in preternatural and supernatural agencies and appearances,\r\nand his faith in miraculous communication between God and man; in\r\nfact, in that mysticism and marvel-love, which are the columns and\r\ncorner-stones of religion. Mormonism thus easily arose. It will be\r\nfound to contain little beyond a literal and verbal interpretation\r\nof the only book which Chillingworth recognizes as the rule for\r\nChristians, and a pointed condemnation of those who make the contents\r\nof the Bible typical, metaphysical, or symbolical, “as if God were\r\nnot honest when he speaks with man, or uses words in other than their\r\ntrue acceptation,” or could “palter in a double sense.” It proposed\r\nas its three general principles, firstly, total immersion in the\r\nwaters of baptism in the name of the three sacred names; secondly,\r\nthe commissioning of prophets, apostles, and elders to administer in\r\nthings holy the revelation and authority of heaven; and, thirdly, the\r\nministering of angels. New Tables of the Law appeared in the Golden\r\nPlates. Another Urim and Thummim revealed to Mr. Joseph Smith that he\r\nwas of the house of Israel and the tribe of Joseph, the inheritor of\r\nall things promised to that favored seed. It tempered the superstitions\r\nof popery with the rationalism of the Protestant; it supplied mankind\r\nwith another sacred book and with an infallible interpreter. Human\r\nbelief had now its weight to carry: those pining for the excitement\r\nof thaumaturgy felt satisfied. The Mormons were no longer compelled\r\nto ask “what made miracles cease,” and “why and in which A.D. was the\r\npower taken from the Church.” It relieved them from holding an apparent\r\nabsurdity, viz., that the voices and visitations, the signs, miracles,\r\nand interventions--in fact, all that the Bible submitted to human faith\r\nhad ended without reason about the time when one Constantine became\r\nking, and do not recommence now when they are most wanted. The Mormons\r\nare not forced to think that God is virtually dead in the world; the\r\neminently practical tendencies of the New-World race cause them to\r\ndevelop into practice their contradiction of an inference from which\r\nhuman nature revolts. They claim to be the true Protestants, _i. e._,\r\nthose who protest against the doctrines of a ceased fellowship between\r\nthe Creator and the creature made in his image; they gratify their\r\nself-esteem by sneering at those who confine themselves to the old\r\nand obsolete revelation, and by pitying the blindness and ignorance\r\nthat can not or will not open its eyes to the new light. Hence it\r\nfollows that few Catholics become Mormons, and that those few become\r\nbad Mormons. Man’s powers of faith grow, like his physical force,\r\nwith exercise. He considers over-belief a venial error compared with\r\nunder-belief, and he progresses more easily in belief than he can\r\nretrograde into disbelief. Thus Catholicism has spread more widely\r\nover the world than the less credulous Protestantism, and the more\r\nthaumaturgic Mormonism is better adapted to some minds--the Hindoo’s,\r\nfor instance--than Catholicism.\r\n\r\nIn Mormonism, or, rather, in Mormon sacred literature, there are\r\nthree epochs which bring us down to the present day. The first is\r\nthe monogamic age, that of the books of Mormon, and of Doctrines and\r\nCovenants--1830-1843. The second is the polygamic, from the first\r\nrevelation of “celestial marriage” to Mr. Joseph Smith in 1843, and by\r\nhim communicated to three followers only, until its final establishment\r\nby Mr. Brigham Young in 1852, when secrecy was no longer deemed\r\nnecessary. The third is the materialistic period; the doctrine, “not\r\nfounded on modern supernatural revelation, but on reason and common\r\nsense,” was the work of 1848-1849.\r\n\r\n[THE BOOK OF MORMON.]\r\n\r\nThe first epoch laid the foundations of the Faith. It produced the Book\r\nof Mormon, “an abridgment written by the hand of Mormon upon plates\r\ntaken from the plates of Nephi. Wherefore it is an abridgment of the\r\nrecord of the people of Nephi, and also of the Lamanites; written to\r\nthe Lamanites, who are a remnant of the house of Israel, and also to\r\nJew and Gentile: written by way of commandment, and also by the spirit\r\nof prophecy and of revelation. Written and sealed up, and hid up unto\r\nthe Lord, that they might not be destroyed: to come forth by the gift\r\nand power of God unto the interpretation thereof: sealed by the hand of\r\nMormon, and hid up unto the Lord, to come forth in due time by the way\r\nof Gentile; the interpretation thereof by the gift of God!”\r\n\r\n“An abridgment taken from the Book of Ether also, which is a record of\r\nthe people of Jared, who were scattered at the time the Lord confounded\r\nthe language of the people, when they were building a tower to get (!)\r\nto heaven; which is to show unto the remnant of the house of Israel\r\nwhat great things the Lord hath done for their fathers; and that\r\nthey may know the covenants of the Lord, that they are not cast off\r\nforever; and also to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that JESUS\r\nis the CHRIST, the ETERNAL GOD, manifesting himself to all nations;\r\nand now, if there are faults, they are the mistakes of men; therefore\r\ncondemn not the things of God, that ye may be found spotless at the\r\njudgment-seat of Christ. Moroni.”\r\n\r\n  “Translated by Joseph Smith, Jun.”\r\n\r\nThis extract is followed by the testimony of three witnesses, Oliver\r\nCowdery, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris, who declare to have seen\r\nthe Golden Plates with their engravings, which were shown to them by\r\nthe power of God, not of man; and that they knew by the voice of God\r\nthat the records had been translated by the gift and power of God.\r\nFurthermore they “declare with words of solemnness that an angel of God\r\ncame down from heaven, and he brought and laid before our eyes, that we\r\nbeheld and saw the plates and the engravings thereon.” They conclude\r\nwith these solemn words: “And the honor be to the Father, and to the\r\nSon, and to the Holy Ghost, which is one God, Amen.” Then comes “also\r\nthe testimony of eight witnesses”--four Whitmers, three Smiths, and one\r\nPage[203]--who make it “known unto all nations, kindred, tongues, and\r\npeople, unto whom this work shall come, that Joseph Smith, Jun., the\r\ntranslator of this work, has shown unto us the plates of which hath\r\nbeen spoken, which have the appearance of gold; and as many of the\r\nleaves as the said Smith has translated we did handle with our hands;\r\nand we also saw the engravings thereon, all of which has the appearance\r\nof ancient work and of curious workmanship. And this we bear record\r\nwith words of soberness that the said Smith has shown unto us, for we\r\nhave seen and hefted, and know of a surety that the said Smith has got\r\nthe plates of which we have spoken. And we give our hands unto the\r\nworld, to witness unto the world that which we have seen; and we lie\r\nnot, God bearing witness of it.”\r\n\r\n  [203] The total witnesses are thus eleven, exactly the number that\r\n  bore evidence to the original Christian miracles.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the Latter-Day Saints’ Biblion will best be understood\r\nfrom the subjoined list of contents.[204]\r\n\r\n  [204] At the end of this chapter I have inserted a synopsis of Mormon\r\n  chronology.\r\n\r\n  FIRST BOOK OF NEPHI.\r\n\r\n  Language of the Record.\r\n  Nephi’s Abridgment.\r\n  Lehi’s Dream.\r\n  Lehi departs into the Wilderness.\r\n  Nephi slayeth Laban.\r\n  Sariah complains of Lehi’s Vision.\r\n  Contents of the brass Plates.\r\n  Ishmael goes with Nephi.\r\n  Nephi’s Brethren rebel, and bind him.\r\n  Lehi’s Dream of the Tree, Rod, etc.\r\n  Messiah and John prophesied of.\r\n  Olive-branches broken off.\r\n  Nephi’s Vision of Mary.\r\n  Do. the Crucifixion of Christ.\r\n  Do.

It contains two parts. The first, of sixty-four\r\npages, is entitled “Lectures on Faith;” although published in the name\r\nof the Prophet Joseph, it was written, men say, by Sidney Rigdon.\r\nThe second, which, with the Appendix, concludes the book, is called\r\nCovenants and Commandments (_scil._, of the Lord to his servants of the\r\nChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints).\r\n\r\n[DOCTRINES AND COVENANTS.]\r\n\r\nOf the Lectures, the first is upon “Faith itself--what it is.” It\r\ntreats the subject in the normal way, showing how much faith is\r\nunconsciously exercised by man in his every-day life, and making it\r\n“the principle by which Jehovah acts.” The second is concerning “the\r\nsubject on which Faith rests,” and contains an ancient chronology from\r\nAdam to Abraham, showing how the knowledge of God was preserved. The\r\nthird, on the attributes of God, enlarges upon the dogma that “correct\r\nideas of the character of God are necessary in order to the exercise of\r\nfaith in him for life and salvation.” The fourth shows the “connection\r\nthere is between correct ideas of the attributes of God, and the\r\nexercise of faith in him unto eternal life.” The fifth, following those\r\nthat treat of the being, character, perfection, and attributes of God,\r\n“speaks of the Godhead”--meaning the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost--and\r\nexplains the peculiarities of the “personage of tabernacle.” The sixth\r\n“treats of the knowledge which persons must have, that the tenor of\r\nlife which they preserve is according to the will of God, in order that\r\nthey may be enabled to exercise faith in him unto life and salvation.”\r\nThe seventh and last discusses the effects of faith. Each lecture is\r\nfollowed by “questions and answers on the foregoing principles,” after\r\nthe fashion of school catechisms, and to asterisk’d sentences a note is\r\nappended: “Let the student commit the paragraph to memory.” There is\r\none merit in the lectures: like Wesley’s Hymns, they are written for\r\nthe poor and simple; consequently, they are read where a higher tone of\r\nthought and style would remain unheeded.\r\n\r\n[POLYGAMY.]\r\n\r\nThe “Index in order of date to Part Second” will explain its\r\ncontents.[205] The Appendix contains twelve pages of revelation on\r\nmarriage, government, and laws in general, and finally the “martyrdom\r\nof Joseph Smith” (no longer junior) “and his brother Hyrum.”\r\nRespecting the connubial state, the Gentile and exoteric reads with\r\nastonishment the following sentence (no date, but between 1842 and\r\n1843): “Inasmuch as this Church of Christ has been reproached with the\r\ncrime of fornication and polygamy, we declare that we believe that one\r\nman should have one wife, and one woman but one husband, except in case\r\nof death, when either is at liberty to marry again.”\r\n\r\n  [205] Index in the order of date to Part Second:\r\n\r\n  Sec.\r\n   30.

I give _in\r\nextenso_ the sole command of heaven upon the subject of\r\n\r\n  CELESTIAL MARRIAGE:\r\n\r\n  A REVELATION ON THE PATRIARCHAL ORDER OF MATRIMONY, OR PLURALITY OF\r\n  WIVES.\r\n\r\n  _Given to Joseph Smith, the Seer, in Nauvoo, July 12th, 1843._\r\n\r\n  1. Verily, then saith the Lord unto you, my servant Joseph, that\r\n  inasmuch as you have inquired of my hand to know and understand\r\n  wherein I, the Lord, justified my servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,\r\n  as also Moses, David, and Solomon, my servants, as touching the\r\n  principle and doctrine of their having many wives and concubines:\r\n  Behold, and lo, I am the Lord thy God, and will answer thee as\r\n  touching this matter: therefore prepare thy heart to receive and obey\r\n  the instructions which I am about to give unto you; for all those who\r\n  have this law revealed unto them must obey the same; for behold, I\r\n  reveal unto you a new and an everlasting covenant; and if ye abide\r\n  not that covenant, then are ye damned; for no one can reject this\r\n  covenant, and be permitted to enter into my glory; for all who will\r\n  have a blessing at my hands shall abide the law which was appointed\r\n  for that blessing, and the conditions thereof, as was instituted from\r\n  before the foundations of the world; and as pertaining to the new and\r\n  everlasting covenant, it was instituted for the fullness of my glory;\r\n  and he that receiveth a fullness thereof must and shall abide the\r\n  law, or he shall be damned, saith the Lord God.\r\n\r\n  2. And verily I say unto you, that the conditions of this law are\r\n  these: All covenants, contracts, bonds, obligations, oaths, vows,\r\n  performances, connections, associations, or expectations that are\r\n  not made and entered into, and sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise,\r\n  of him who is anointed, both as well for time and for all eternity,\r\n  and that, too, most holy, by revelation and commandment, through\r\n  the medium of mine anointed, whom I have appointed on the earth to\r\n  hold this power (and I have appointed unto my servant Joseph to hold\r\n  this power in the last days, and there is never but one on the earth\r\n  at a time on whom this power and the keys of the priesthood are\r\n  conferred), are of no efficacy, virtue, or force in and after the\r\n  resurrection from the dead; for all contracts that are not made unto\r\n  this end have an end when men are dead.\r\n\r\n  3. Behold, mine house is a house of order, saith the Lord God, and\r\n  not a house of confusion. Will I accept of an offering, saith the\r\n  Lord, that is not made in my name? Or will I receive at your hands\r\n  that which I have not appointed? And will I appoint unto you, saith\r\n  the Lord, except it be by law, even as I and my Father ordained unto\r\n  you before the world was? I am the Lord thy God, and I give unto\r\n  you this commandment, that no man shall come unto the Father but by\r\n  me, or by my word which is my law, saith the Lord; and every thing\r\n  that is in the world, whether it be ordained of men, by thrones, or\r\n  principalities, or powers, or things of name, whatsoever they may be,\r\n  that are not by me, or by my word, saith the Lord, shall be thrown\r\n  down, and shall not remain after men are dead, neither in nor after\r\n  the resurrection, saith the Lord your God; for whatsoever things\r\n  remaineth are by me, and whatsoever things are not by me shall be\r\n  shaken and destroyed.\r\n\r\n  4. Therefore, if a man marry him a wife in the world, and he marry\r\n  her not by me, nor by my word, and he covenant with her so long as\r\n  he is in the world, and she with him, their covenant and marriage\r\n  is not of force when they are dead, and when they are out of the\r\n  world; therefore they are not bound by any law when they are out of\r\n  the world; therefore, when they are out of the world, they neither\r\n  marry nor are given in marriage, but are appointed angels in heaven,\r\n  which angels are ministering servants, to minister for those who are\r\n  worthy of a far more and an exceeding and an eternal weight of glory;\r\n  for these angels did not abide my law, therefore they can not be\r\n  enlarged, but remain separately and singly, without exaltation, in\r\n  their saved condition, to all eternity, and from henceforth are not\r\n  gods, but are angels of God forever and ever.\r\n\r\n  5. And again, verily I say unto you, if a man marry a wife, and make\r\n  a covenant with her for time and for all eternity, if that covenant\r\n  is not by me or by my word, which is my law, and is not sealed by\r\n  the Holy Spirit of promise, through him whom I have anointed and\r\n  appointed unto this power, then it is not valid, neither of force,\r\n  when they are out of the world, because they are not joined by me,\r\n  saith the Lord, neither by my word; when they are out of the world,\r\n  it can not be received there, because the angels and the gods are\r\n  appointed there, by whom they can not pass: they can not, therefore,\r\n  inherit my glory, for my house is a house of order, saith the Lord\r\n  God.\r\n\r\n  6. And again, verily I say unto you, if a man marry a wife by my\r\n  word, which is my law, and by the new and everlasting covenant, and\r\n  it is sealed unto them by the Holy Spirit of promise, by him who is\r\n  anointed, unto whom I have appointed this power, and the keys of this\r\n  priesthood, and it shall be said unto them, ye shall come forth in\r\n  the first resurrection; and if it be after the first resurrection,\r\n  in the next resurrection; and shall inherit thrones, kingdoms,\r\n  principalities, and powers, dominions, all heights and depths, then\r\n  shall it be written in the Lamb’s Book of Life that he shall commit\r\n  no murder whereby to shed innocent blood; and if ye abide in my\r\n  covenant, and commit no murder whereby to shed innocent blood, it\r\n  shall be done unto them in all things whatsoever my servant hath put\r\n  upon them, in time and through all eternity, and shall be of full\r\n  force when they are out of the world; and they shall pass by the\r\n  angels, and the gods which are set there, to their exaltation and\r\n  glory in all things, as hath been sealed upon their heads, which\r\n  glory shall be a fullness and a continuation of the seeds forever and\r\n  ever.\r\n\r\n  7. Then shall they be gods, because they have no end; therefore shall\r\n  they be from everlasting to everlasting, because they continue; then\r\n  shall they be above all, because all things are subject unto them.\r\n  Then shall they be gods, because they have all power, and the angels\r\n  are subject unto them.\r\n\r\n  8. Verily, verily I say unto you, except ye abide my law, ye can not\r\n  attain to this glory; for straight is the gate and narrow the way\r\n  that leadeth unto the exaltation and continuation of the lives, and\r\n  few there be that find it, because ye receive me not in the world,\r\n  neither do ye know me. But if ye receive me in the world, then shall\r\n  ye know me, and shall receive your exaltation, that where I am ye\r\n  shall be also. This is eternal life, to know the only wise and\r\n  true God, and Jesus Christ whom he hath sent. I am he. Receive ye,\r\n  therefore, my law. Broad is the gate and wide the way that leadeth to\r\n  death, and many there are that go in thereat, because they receive me\r\n  not, neither do they abide in my law.\r\n\r\n  9. Verily, verily I say unto you, if a man marry a wife according\r\n  to my word, and they are sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise\r\n  according to mine appointment, and he or she shall commit any sin or\r\n  transgression of the new and everlasting covenant whatever, and all\r\n  manner of blasphemies, and if they commit no murder wherein they shed\r\n  innocent blood, yet they shall come forth in the first resurrection,\r\n  and enter into their exaltation, but they shall be destroyed in the\r\n  flesh, and shall be delivered unto the buffetings of Satan unto the\r\n  day of redemption, saith the Lord God.\r\n\r\n  10. The blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, which shall not be forgiven\r\n  in the world nor out of the world, is in that ye commit murder\r\n  wherein ye shed innocent blood, and assent unto my death after ye\r\n  have received my new and everlasting covenant, saith the Lord God;\r\n  and he that abideth not this law can in nowise enter into my glory,\r\n  but shall be damned, saith the Lord.\r\n\r\n  11. I am the Lord thy God, and will give unto thee the law of my\r\n  holy priesthood, as was ordained by me, and my Father before the\r\n  world was. Abraham received all things, whatsoever he received, by\r\n  revelation and commandment, by my word, saith the Lord, and hath\r\n  entered into his exaltation, and sitteth upon his throne.\r\n\r\n  12. Abraham received promises concerning his seed and of the fruit of\r\n  his loins--from whose loins ye are, viz., my servant Joseph--which\r\n  were to continue so long as they were in the world; and as touching\r\n  Abraham and his seed out of the world, they should continue; both in\r\n  the world and out of the world should they continue as innumerable\r\n  as the stars; or, if ye were to count the sand upon the sea-shore,\r\n  ye could not number them. This promise is yours also, because ye are\r\n  of Abraham, and the promise was made unto Abraham; and by this law\r\n  are the continuation of the works of my Father, wherein he glorifieth\r\n  himself. Go ye, therefore, and do the works of Abraham; enter ye into\r\n  my law, and ye shall be saved. But if ye enter not into my law ye can\r\n  not receive the promises of my Father which he made unto Abraham.\r\n\r\n  13. God commanded Abraham, and Sarah gave Hagar to Abraham to wife.\r\n  And why did she do it? Because this was the law, and from Hagar\r\n  sprang many people. This, therefore, was fulfilling, among other\r\n  things, the promises. Was Abraham, therefore, under condemnation?\r\n  Verily, I say unto you, _Nay_; for I, the Lord, commanded it. Abraham\r\n  was commanded to offer his son Isaac; nevertheless, it was written,\r\n  Thou shalt not kill. Abraham, however, did not refuse, and it was\r\n  accounted unto him for righteousness.\r\n\r\n  14. Abraham received concubines, and they bare him children, and it\r\n  was accounted unto him for righteousness, because they were given\r\n  unto him for righteousness, because they were given unto him, and\r\n  he abode in my law; as Isaac also, and Jacob did none other things\r\n  than that which they were commanded, and because they did none other\r\n  things than that which they were commanded, they have entered into\r\n  their exaltation, according to the promises, and sit upon thrones;\r\n  and are not angels, but are gods. David also received many wives and\r\n  concubines, as also Solomon, and Moses my servant; and also many\r\n  others of my servants, from the beginning of creation until this\r\n  time; and in nothing did they sin save in those things which they\r\n  received not of me.\r\n\r\n  15. David’s wives and concubines were given unto him, of me, by the\r\n  hand of Nathan, my servant, and others of the prophets who had the\r\n  keys of this power; and in none of these things did he sin against\r\n  me, save in the case of Uriah and his wife; and therefore he hath\r\n  fallen from his exaltation, and received his portion; and he shall\r\n  not inherit them out of the world; for I gave them unto another,\r\n  saith the Lord.\r\n\r\n  16. I am the Lord thy God, and I gave unto thee, my servant Joseph,\r\n  an appointment, and to restore all things; ask what ye will, and\r\n  it shall be given unto you, according to my word; and as ye have\r\n  asked concerning adultery, verily, verily I say unto you, if a man\r\n  receiveth a wife in the new and everlasting covenant, and if she\r\n  be with another man, and I have not appointed unto her by the holy\r\n  anointing, she hath committed adultery, and shall be destroyed. If\r\n  she be not in the new and everlasting covenant, and she be with\r\n  another man, she has committed adultery; and if her husband be with\r\n  another woman, and he was under a vow, he hath broken his vow, and\r\n  hath committed adultery; and if she hath not committed adultery, but\r\n  is innocent, and hath not broken her vow, and she knoweth it, and I\r\n  reveal it unto you, my servant Joseph, then shall you have power,\r\n  by the power of my holy priesthood, to take her and give her unto\r\n  him that hath not committed adultery, but hath been faithful, for he\r\n  shall be made ruler over many; for I have conferred upon you the keys\r\n  and power of the priesthood, wherein I restore all things, and make\r\n  known unto you all things in due time.\r\n\r\n  17. And verily, verily I say unto you, that whatsoever you seal on\r\n  earth shall be sealed in heaven; and whatsoever you bind on earth, in\r\n  my name and by my word, saith the Lord, it shall be eternally bound\r\n  in the heavens; and whosesoever sins you remit on earth, shall be\r\n  remitted eternally in the heavens; and whosesoever sins ye retain on\r\n  earth, shall be retained in heaven.\r\n\r\n  18. And again, verily I say, whomsoever you bless I will bless, and\r\n  whomsoever you curse I will curse, saith the Lord; for I, the Lord,\r\n  am thy God.\r\n\r\n  19. And again, verily I say unto you, my servant Joseph, that\r\n  whatsoever you give on earth, and to whomsoever you give any one on\r\n  earth, by my word, and according to my law, it shall be visited with\r\n  blessings, and not cursings, and with my power, saith the Lord, and\r\n  shall be without condemnation on earth and in heaven; for I am the\r\n  Lord thy God, and will be with thee even unto the end of the world,\r\n  and through all eternity; for verily I seal upon you your exaltation,\r\n  and prepare a throne for you in the kingdom of my Father with Abraham\r\n  your father. Behold, I have seen your sacrifices, and will forgive\r\n  all your sins; I have seen your sacrifices in obedience to that which\r\n  I have told you: go, therefore, and I make a way for your escape, as\r\n  I accepted the offering of Abraham of his son Isaac.\r\n\r\n  20. Verily I say unto you, a commandment I give unto mine handmaid,\r\n  Emma Smith, your wife, whom I have given unto you, that she stay\r\n  herself, and partake not of that which I commanded you to offer\r\n  unto her; for I did it, saith the Lord, to prove you all, as I\r\n  did Abraham, and that I might require an offering at your hand by\r\n  covenant and sacrifice; and let mine handmaid, Emma Smith, receive\r\n  all those that have been given unto my servant Joseph, and who are\r\n  virtuous and pure before me; and those who are not pure, and have\r\n  said they are pure, shall be destroyed, saith the Lord God; for I\r\n  am the Lord thy God, and ye shall obey my voice: and I give unto my\r\n  servant Joseph that he shall be made ruler over many things, for he\r\n  hath been faithful over a few things, and from henceforth I will\r\n  strengthen him.\r\n\r\n  21. And I command mine handmaid, Emma Smith, to abide and cleave unto\r\n  my servant Joseph, and to none else. But if she will not abide this\r\n  commandment, she shall be destroyed, saith the Lord; for I am the\r\n  Lord thy God, and will destroy her if she abide not in my law; but\r\n  if she will not abide this commandment, then shall my servant Joseph\r\n  do all things for her, even as he hath said; and I will bless him,\r\n  and multiply him, and give unto him an hundred-fold in this world, of\r\n  fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, houses and lands, wives\r\n  and children, and crowns of eternal lives in the eternal worlds. And\r\n  again, verily I say, let mine handmaid forgive my servant Joseph his\r\n  trespasses, and then shall she be forgiven her trespasses wherein she\r\n  has trespassed against me; and I, the Lord thy God, will bless her\r\n  and multiply her, and make her heart to rejoice.\r\n\r\n  22. And again I say, let not my servant Joseph put his property out\r\n  of his hands, lest an enemy come and destroy him, for Satan seeketh\r\n  to destroy; for I am the Lord thy God, and he is my servant; and\r\n  behold, and lo, I am with him, as I was with Abraham thy father, even\r\n  unto his exaltation and glory.\r\n\r\n  23. Now, as touching the law of the priesthood, there are many things\r\n  pertaining thereunto. Verily, if a man be called of my Father, as was\r\n  Aaron, by mine own voice, and by the voice of him that sent me, and I\r\n  have endowed him with the keys of the power of this priesthood, if he\r\n  do any thing in my name, and according to my law, and by my word, he\r\n  will not commit sin, and I will justify him. Let no one, therefore,\r\n  set on my servant Joseph; for I will justify him; for he shall do the\r\n  sacrifice which I require at his hands, for his transgressions, saith\r\n  the Lord your God.\r\n\r\n  24. And again, as pertaining to the law of the priesthood: If any man\r\n  espouse a virgin, and desire to espouse another, and the first give\r\n  her consent; and if he espouse the second, and they are virgins, and\r\n  have vowed to no other man, then is he justified; he can not commit\r\n  adultery, for they are given unto him; for he can not commit adultery\r\n  with that that belongeth unto them, and to none else: and if he have\r\n  ten virgins given unto him by this law, he can not commit adultery,\r\n  for they belong to him, and they are given unto him; therefore is\r\n  he justified. But if one, or either of the ten virgins, after she\r\n  is espoused, shall be with another man, she has committed adultery,\r\n  and shall be destroyed; for they are given unto him to multiply and\r\n  replenish the earth, according to my commandment, and to fulfill the\r\n  promise which was given by my Father before the foundation of the\r\n  world, and for their exaltation in the eternal worlds, that they may\r\n  bear the souls of men; for herein is the work of my Father continued,\r\n  that he may be glorified.\r\n\r\n  25. And again, verily, verily I say unto you, if any man have a wife\r\n  who holds the keys of this power, and he teaches unto her the law of\r\n  my priesthood as pertaining to these things, then shall she believe,\r\n  and administer unto him, or she shall be destroyed, saith the Lord\r\n  your God; for I will destroy her; for I will magnify my name upon\r\n  all those who receive and abide in my law. Therefore it shall be\r\n  lawful in me, if she receive not this law, for him to receive all\r\n  things whatsoever I, the Lord his God, will give unto him, because\r\n  she did not believe and administer unto him, according to my word;\r\n  and she then becomes the transgressor, and he is exempt from the law\r\n  of Sarah, who administered unto Abraham according to the law, when I\r\n  commanded Abraham to take Hagar to wife. And now, as pertaining to\r\n  this law: Verily, verily I say unto you, I will reveal more unto you\r\n  hereafter; therefore let this suffice for the present. Behold, I am\r\n  Alpha and Omega. Amen.\r\n\r\nFollowing the revelation is this explanation:\r\n\r\n[POLYGAMY EXPLAINED.]\r\n\r\n  PLURALITY OF WIVES is a doctrine very popular among most of mankind\r\n  at the present day. It is practiced by the most powerful nations\r\n  of Asia and Africa, and by numerous nations inhabiting the islands\r\n  of the sea, and by the aboriginal nations of the great western\r\n  hemisphere. The one-wife system is confined principally to a few\r\n  small nations inhabiting Europe, and to those who are of European\r\n  origin inhabiting America. It is estimated by the most able\r\n  historians of our day that about four fifths of the population of the\r\n  globe believe and practice, according to their respective laws, the\r\n  doctrine of a plurality of wives. If the popularity of a doctrine\r\n  is in proportion to the numbers who believe in it, then it follows\r\n  that the _plurality system_ is four times more popular among the\r\n  inhabitants of the earth than the _one-wife system_.\r\n\r\n  Those nations who practice the plurality doctrine consider it as\r\n  virtuous and as right for one man to have many wives as to have one\r\n  only. Therefore they have enacted laws not only giving this right to\r\n  their citizens, but also protecting them in it, and punishing all\r\n  those who infringe upon the chastity of the marriage covenant by\r\n  committing adultery with any one of the wives of his neighbor. Those\r\n  nations do not consider it possible for a man to commit adultery\r\n  with any one of those women to whom he has been legally married\r\n  according to their laws. The posterity raised up unto the husband\r\n  through each of his wives are all considered to be legitimate, and\r\n  provisions are made in their laws for those children the same as if\r\n  they were the children of one wife. Adulteries, fornications, and\r\n  all unvirtuous conduct between the sexes are severely punished by\r\n  them. Indeed, plurality among them is considered not only virtuous\r\n  and right, but a great check or preventive against adulteries and\r\n  unlawful connections, which are among the greatest evils with which\r\n  nations are cursed, producing a vast amount of suffering and misery,\r\n  devastation and death; undermining the very foundations of happiness,\r\n  and destroying the frame-work of society and the peace of the\r\n  domestic circle.\r\n\r\n  Some of the nations of Europe who believe in the one-wife system\r\n  have actually forbidden a plurality of wives by their laws, and the\r\n  consequences are that the whole country among them is overrun with\r\n  the most abominable practices; adulteries and unlawful connections\r\n  prevail through all their villages, towns, cities, and country places\r\n  to a most fearful extent. And among some of these nations these sinks\r\n  of wickedness, wretchedness, and misery are licensed by law, while\r\n  their piety would be wonderfully shocked to authorize by law the\r\n  plurality system, as adopted by many neighboring nations.\r\n\r\n  The Constitution and laws of the United States, being founded upon\r\n  the principles of freedom, do not interfere with marriage relations,\r\n  but leave the nation free to believe in and practice the doctrine\r\n  of a plurality of wives, or to confine themselves to the one-wife\r\n  system, just as they choose. This is as it should be: it leaves the\r\n  conscience of man untrammeled, and, so long as he injures no person,\r\n  and does not infringe upon the rights of others, he is free by the\r\n  Constitution to marry one wife, or many, or none at all, and becomes\r\n  accountable to God for the righteousness or unrighteousness of his\r\n  domestic relations.\r\n\r\n  The Constitution leaves the several States and Territories to enact\r\n  such laws as they see proper in regard to marriages, provided that\r\n  they do not infringe upon the rights of conscience and the liberties\r\n  guaranteed in that sacred document. Therefore, if any State or\r\n  Territory feels disposed to enact laws guaranteeing to each of its\r\n  citizens the right to marry many wives, such laws would be perfectly\r\n  constitutional; hence the several States and Territories practice the\r\n  one-wife system out of choice, and not because they are under any\r\n  obligations so to do by the national Constitution. Indeed, we doubt\r\n  very much whether any State or Territory has the constitutional right\r\n  to make laws prohibiting the plurality doctrine in cases where it\r\n  is practiced by religious societies as a matter of conscience or\r\n  as a doctrine of their religious faith. The first Article of the\r\n  Amendments to the Constitution says expressly that “Congress shall\r\n  make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or _prohibiting\r\n  the free exercise thereof_.” Now, if even Congress itself has no\r\n  power to pass a law “prohibiting the free exercise of religion,” much\r\n  less has any State or Territory power to pass such an act.\r\n\r\n  The doctrine of a plurality of wives was believed and practiced by\r\n  Abraham, the father of the faithful; and we find that, while in this\r\n  practice, the angels of God frequently ministered to him, and at one\r\n  time dined with him; and God manifested himself to him, and entered\r\n  into familiar conversation with him. Neither God nor his angels\r\n  reproved Abraham for being a polygamist, but, on the contrary, the\r\n  Almighty greatly blessed him, and made promises unto him, concerning\r\n  both Isaac and Ishmael, clearly showing that Abraham practiced\r\n  what is called polygamy under the sanction of the Almighty. Now if\r\n  the father of the faithful was thus blessed, certainly it should\r\n  not be considered irreligious for the faithful, who are called his\r\n  children, to walk in the steps of their father Abraham. Indeed,\r\n  if the Lord himself, through his holy prophets, should give more\r\n  wives unto his servants, as he gave them unto the prophet David,\r\n  it would be a great sin for them to refuse that which he gives. In\r\n  such a case, it would become a matter of conscience with them, and\r\n  a part of their religion, and they would be bound to exercise their\r\n  faith in this doctrine, and practice it, or be condemned; therefore\r\n  Congress would have no power to prohibit the free exercise of this\r\n  part of their religion, neither would the States or Territories have\r\n  power constitutionally to pass a law “prohibiting the free exercise\r\n  thereof.” Now a certain religious society, called Shakers, believe\r\n  it to be wrong for them to marry even one wife; it certainly would\r\n  be unconstitutional for either the Congress or the States to pass a\r\n  law compelling all people to marry at a certain age, because it would\r\n  infringe upon the rights of conscience among the Shakers, and they\r\n  would be prohibited the free exercise of their religion.\r\n\r\n  From the foregoing revelation, given through Joseph the Seer, it\r\n  will be seen that God has actually commanded some of his servants to\r\n  take more wives, and has pointed out certain duties in regard to the\r\n  marriage ceremony, showing that they must be married for time and for\r\n  all eternity, and showing the advantages to be derived in a future\r\n  state by this eternal union; and showing still farther that, if they\r\n  refused to obey this command, after having the law revealed to them,\r\n  they should be damned. This revelation, then, makes it a matter of\r\n  conscience among all the Latter-Day Saints; and they embrace it as\r\n  a part and portion of their religion, and verily believe that they\r\n  can not be saved and reject it. Has Congress power, then, to pass\r\n  laws “prohibiting” the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints\r\n  “_the free exercise_” of this article of their religion? Have any\r\n  of the States or Territories a constitutional right to pass laws\r\n  “prohibiting the free exercise of the religion” which the Church of\r\n  the Saints conscientiously and sincerely believe to be essential to\r\n  their salvation? No, they have no such right.\r\n\r\n  The Latter-Day Saints have the most implicit confidence in all\r\n  the revelations given through Joseph the Prophet, and they would\r\n  much sooner lay down their lives and suffer martyrdom than to\r\n  deny the least revelation that was ever given to him. In one of\r\n  the revelations through him, we read that God raised up wise men\r\n  and inspired them to write the Constitution of our country, that\r\n  the freedom of the people might be maintained, according to the\r\n  free agency which he had given to them; that every man might be\r\n  accountable to God and not to man, so far as religious doctrines\r\n  and conscience are concerned. And the more we examine that sacred\r\n  instrument, framed by the wisdom of our illustrious fathers, the\r\n  more we are compelled to believe that an invisible power controlled,\r\n  dictated, and guided them in laying the foundation of liberty\r\n  and freedom upon this great western hemisphere. To this land the\r\n  Mohammedan--the Hindoo--the Chinese can emigrate, and each bring\r\n  with him his score of wives and his hundred children, and the\r\n  glorious Constitution of our country will not interfere with his\r\n  domestic relations. Under the broad banner of the Constitution, he\r\n  is protected in all his family associations; none have a right to\r\n  tear any of his wives or his children from him. So, likewise, under\r\n  the broad folds of the Constitution, the Legislative Assembly of\r\n  the Territory of Utah have the right to pass laws regulating their\r\n  matrimonial relations, and protecting each of their citizens in the\r\n  right of marrying one or many wives, as the case may be. If Congress\r\n  should repeal those laws, they could not do so on the ground of their\r\n  being unconstitutional. And even if Congress should repeal them,\r\n  there still would be no law in Utah prohibiting the free exercise of\r\n  that religious right; neither do the citizens of Utah feel disposed\r\n  to pass such an unconstitutional act which would infringe upon the\r\n  most sacred rights of conscience.\r\n\r\n  Tradition and custom have great influence over nations.\r\n  Long-established customs, whether right or wrong, become sacred in\r\n  the estimation of mankind. Those nations who have been accustomed\r\n  from time immemorial to the practice of what is called polygamy would\r\n  consider a law abolishing it as the very height of injustice and\r\n  oppression; the very idea of being limited to the one-wife system\r\n  would be considered not only oppressive and unjust, but absolutely\r\n  absurd and ridiculous; it would be considered an innovation upon\r\n  the long-established usages, customs, and laws of numerous and\r\n  powerful nations; an innovation of the most dangerous character,\r\n  calculated to destroy the most sacred rights and privileges of family\r\n  associations--to upset the very foundations of individual rights,\r\n  rendered dear and sacred by being handed down to them from the most\r\n  remote ages of antiquity.\r\n\r\n  On the other hand, the European nations who have been for centuries\r\n  restricted by law to the one-wife theory would consider it a shocking\r\n  innovation upon the customs of their fathers to abolish their\r\n  restrictive laws, and to give freedom and liberty according to the\r\n  plurality system. It is custom, then, in a great degree, that forms\r\n  the conscience of nations and individuals in regard to the marriage\r\n  relationships. Custom causes four fifths of the population of the\r\n  globe to decide that polygamy, as it is called, is a good, and not an\r\n  evil practice; custom causes the balance, or the remaining fifth, to\r\n  decide in opposition to the great majority.\r\n\r\n  Those individuals who have strength of mind sufficient to divest\r\n  themselves entirely from the influence of custom, and examine the\r\n  doctrine of a plurality of wives under the light of reason and\r\n  revelation, will be forced to the conclusion that it is a doctrine of\r\n  divine origin; that it was embraced and practiced under the divine\r\n  sanction by the most righteous men who ever lived on the earth: holy\r\n  prophets and patriarchs, who were inspired by the Holy Ghost--who\r\n  were enrapt in the visions of the Almighty--who conversed with holy\r\n  angels--who saw God face to face, and talked with him as a man\r\n  talks with his friend--were “polygamists,” that is, they had many\r\n  wives--raised up many children by them--and were never reproved by\r\n  the Holy Ghost, nor by angels, nor by the Almighty, for believing in\r\n  and practicing such a doctrine; on the contrary, each one of these\r\n  “polygamists” received by revelation promises and blessings for\r\n  himself, for his wives, and for his numerous children born unto him\r\n  by his numerous wives. Moreover, the Lord himself gave revelation\r\n  to different wives belonging to the same man, revealing to them\r\n  the great blessings which should rest upon their posterity; angels\r\n  also were sent to comfort and bless them; and in no instance do we\r\n  find them reproved for having joined themselves in marriage to a\r\n  “polygamist.” Indeed, the Lord himself gave laws not to prohibit\r\n  “polygamy,” but showing his will in relation to the children raised\r\n  up by the different wives of the same man; and, furthermore, the\r\n  Lord himself actually officiated in giving David all the wives of\r\n  Saul; this occurred, too, when David already had several wives which\r\n  he had previously taken: therefore, as the Lord did actually give\r\n  into David’s own bosom all the wives of Saul, he must not only have\r\n  sanctioned “polygamy,” but established and instituted it upon a sure\r\n  foundation, by giving the wives himself, the same as he gave Eve to\r\n  Adam. Therefore those who are completely divested from the influence\r\n  of national customs, and who judge concerning this matter by the\r\n  Word of God, are compelled to believe that the plurality of wives\r\n  was once sanctioned for many ages by the Almighty; and by a still\r\n  farther research of the divine oracles they find no intimations that\r\n  this divine institution was ever repealed. It was an institution, not\r\n  originated under the law of Moses, but of a far more ancient date;\r\n  and instead of being abolished by that law, it was sanctioned and\r\n  perpetuated; and when Christ came to fulfill that law, and to do it\r\n  away by the introduction of a better covenant, he did not abolish the\r\n  plurality system: not being originated under that law, it was not\r\n  made null and void when that law was done away. Indeed, there were\r\n  many things in connection with the law that were not abolished when\r\n  the law was fulfilled; as, for instance, the Ten Commandments, which\r\n  the people under the Gospel covenant were still obliged to obey;\r\n  and until we can find some law of God abolishing and prohibiting\r\n  a plurality of wives, we are compelled to believe it a divine\r\n  institution; and we are furthermore compelled to believe, that if\r\n  this institution be entered into now, under the same principles which\r\n  governed the holy prophets and patriarchs, that God will approbate it\r\n  now as much as he did then; and that the persons who do thus practice\r\n  it conscientiously and sincerely are just as honorable in the sight\r\n  of God as those who have but one wife. And that which is honorable\r\n  before God should be honorable before men; and no one should be\r\n  despised when he acts in all good conscience upon any principle of\r\n  doctrine; neither should there be laws in any of these States or\r\n  Territories to compel any individual to act in violation to the\r\n  dictates of his own conscience; but every one should be left in all\r\n  matters of religion to his own choice, and thus become accountable to\r\n  God, and not to his fellow-man.\r\n\r\n  If the people of this country have generally formed different\r\n  conclusions from us upon this subject, and if they have embraced\r\n  religions which are more congenial to their minds than the religion\r\n  of the Saints, we say to them that they are welcome to their own\r\n  religious views; the laws should not interfere with the exercise\r\n  of their religious rights. If we can not convince you by reason\r\n  nor by the Word of God that your religion is wrong, we will not\r\n  persecute you, but will sustain you in the privileges guaranteed\r\n  in the great Charter of American Liberty: we ask from you the\r\n  same generosity--protect us in the exercise of our religious\r\n  rights--convince us of our errors of doctrine, if we have any, by\r\n  reason, by logical arguments, or by the Word of God, and we will\r\n  be ever grateful for the information, and you will ever have the\r\n  pleasing reflection that you have been the instruments in the hands\r\n  of God of redeeming your fellow-beings from the darkness which you\r\n  may see enveloping their minds. Come, then, let us reason together,\r\n  and try to discover the true light upon all subjects connected\r\n  with our temporal or eternal happiness; and if we disagree in our\r\n  judgments, let us impute it to the weakness and imperfections of\r\n  our fallen natures, and let us pity each other, and endeavor with\r\n  patience and meekness to reclaim from error, and save the immortal\r\n  soul from an endless death.\r\n\r\nMormonism, it will be observed, claims at once to be, like\r\nChristianity, a progressive faith, with that development of\r\nspiritualism which the “Tracts for the Times” exemplified, and, like\r\nEl Islam, to be a restoration by revelation of the pure and primeval\r\nreligion of the world. Convinced that plurality was unforbidden by the\r\nfounders of the former faiths, the Mormons, as well as the followers of\r\nthe Arabian Prophet, have obeyed the command of their God to restore\r\nit, and that, too, although the Anglo-Scandinavian race every where\r\nagrees, after the fashion of pagan and monogamic Rome, to make it a\r\ncommon-law crime. Politically considered, the Mormons deem it necessary\r\nto their existence as a people. Contrary to the scientific modern\r\neconomist, from Mr. Malthus to Mr. Mill, they hold population, not\r\nwealth, learning, civilization, nor virtue, to be the strength of a\r\nnation; they believe that numbers decide the rise and fall of empires,\r\nand that, as Nature works the extinction of her doomed races by\r\ninfecundity, and as the decline of a people’s destiny is first detected\r\nin the diminution of its census, so they look upon the celestial\r\npromises of prolificity made to the patriarchs of old as the highest\r\ntemporal blessing. They admit in the lawgiver only a right to legislate\r\nfor the good of those who are to obey his laws, not to gratify his\r\n“whimsy whamsies,” and that the liberty which man claims by the dignity\r\nof his nature permits him to choose the tie, whether polyandric,\r\nmonogamic, or polygamic, that connects him with the opposite sex. Mr.\r\nParley P. Pratt (“Marriage and Morals in Utah,” p. 3) is explicit upon\r\nthis subject:\r\n\r\n“If we find laws, statutes, covenants, and precedents emanating from\r\nGod; sworn to by himself to be everlasting; as a blessing to all\r\nnations--if we find these have to do with exceeding multiplicity of\r\nrace, and with family and national organization and increase--if such\r\ninstitutions are older than Moses, and are found perpetuated and\r\nunimpaired by Moses and the prophets, Jesus and the apostles, then it\r\nwill appear evident that no merely human legislation or authority,\r\nwhether proceeding from emperor, king, or people, has a right to\r\nchange, alter, or pervert them.”\r\n\r\n[MORMON MATERIALISM.]\r\n\r\nThe third epoch is that of Materialism. In this the Mormons are\r\npreceded, to quote but a few schools, by the classic Academics--by\r\nthe Jews, who believed in a material and personal Demiurgus, and by\r\nmany fathers of the Christian Church, who held the soul of man, while\r\nimmortal, to be material. Matter with them, as with Newton, is an\r\naggregate of “solid, massy, hard, impenetrable, and movable particles.”\r\nRespecting the intelligence of its units and molecules--the test of\r\ntrue materialism--they are somewhat hazy; they deride the peripatetic\r\ndogma of perception by species or phantasms, and at the same time\r\nignore the doctrine of Hobbes, Spinoza, Priestley, and others, who\r\nrecognize no separate existence for the mind or spirit[206] except\r\nas a union of atoms or particles, which, unorganized, have neither\r\nfeeling nor thought. They define matter as a something that exists in\r\nand occupies space between any two instants, and is susceptible of\r\ndivision, and of being removed from one portion of space to another.\r\nUnlike other metaphysicians, who confess ignorance as to the substratum\r\nof mind and matter, they boast acquaintance with the essence of all\r\nsubstances, solidity, which with them is not a mere property. Although\r\nthe ultimate atoms of matter can not come under the cognizance of\r\nthe senses, they are none the less assured of their solidity, viz.,\r\nthat they fill a certain amount of space, and are unable ever to\r\nfill a greater or a lesser--in fact, to believe otherwise would be\r\nimpossible. They hold to different kinds of matter, for instance, the\r\nfleshly body and the spiritual body, which differ in quality as iron\r\nand oxygen. Mind and spirit, therefore, are real, objective, positive\r\nsubstances, which, like the astral spirit of the old alchymists, exists\r\nin close connection with the component parts of the porous, material\r\nbody. Immaterialism is, with them, simply absurd; it is a belief which\r\nrequires a man to put faith in a negation of time, space, and matter;\r\nin fact, in the zero of existence, in an entity whose ens admits no\r\nproof, and which can be described only by negative conditions and\r\nqualities, by saying what it is not. They contend that the materiality\r\nof spirit once taken away would negative its existence; that an\r\n“immaterial being” is a contradiction in terms; and that immateriality\r\nis another name for nothing; therefore, that the spirituality of spirit\r\n“is an unphilosophical, unscriptural, and atheistical doctrine.” The\r\ntheses supported by Mr. Orson Pratt, the apostle of materialism, are\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n  [206] “If man,” says Dr. Priestley, “be a material being, and the\r\n  power of thinking the result of a certain organization of the brain,\r\n  does it not follow that all his functions must be regulated by the\r\n  laws of mechanism, and that, of consequence, all his actions proceed\r\n  from an irresistible necessity?” It is the glory of the present\r\n  age, the highest result of our nineteenth century physiological and\r\n  statistic studies, brought to bear by a master-mind of the age upon\r\n  the History of Civilization--to establish the fact that mankind\r\n  progresses by investigating the laws of phenomena; in fact, to prove,\r\n  not to conjecture, that such mechanism really exists. I need hardly\r\n  name Mr. Buckle.\r\n\r\nI. That Immaterialism is irrational opposed to true philosophy.\r\n\r\nII. That an Immaterial substance (_i.e._, a something existing which\r\nis not matter and is distinct from matter, which is not dependent upon\r\nmatter for its existence, which possesses no properties nor qualities\r\nin common with matter, and which possesses properties and qualities all\r\nentirely different from those of matter) can not exist.\r\n\r\nIII. That a real material unchangeable spirit, possessing parts and\r\nextension, inhabits the body.\r\n\r\nImmaterialists who believe in “an inexplicable, incomprehensible,\r\nimaginary something without extension or parts, as taught in the first\r\nof the Thirty-nine Articles,” are therefore the worshipers of an\r\nimmortal Nihil--of a Nothing clothed with almighty powers.\r\n\r\nIt is abundantly evident that the partition between the spiritualist\r\nand the materialist is mainly philological, a dispute of words, a\r\nvariation of terms, spirit and matter differing about as much as azote\r\nand nitrogen. The deductions, however, from the Mormon’s premises lead\r\nhim, as the following extracts prove, far.[207]\r\n\r\n  [207] From Mr. Apostle Orson Pratt’s “Absurdities of Immaterialism,”\r\n  and his treatise on the “Kingdom of God.” It is hardly possible not\r\n  to believe that the author has borrowed most of his theories from Mr.\r\n  Carlyle’s “Republican.”\r\n\r\n“The Godhead consists of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The\r\nFather is a material being. The substance of which he is composed is\r\nwholly material. It is a substance widely different in some respects\r\nfrom the various substances with which we are more immediately\r\nacquainted. In other respects, it is precisely like all other\r\nmaterials. The substance of his person occupies space the same as other\r\nmatter. It has solidity, length, breadth, and thickness, like other\r\nmatter. The elementary materials of his body are not susceptible of\r\noccupying at the same time the same identical space with other matter.\r\nThe substance of his person, like other matter, can not be in two\r\nplaces at the same instant. It requires _time_ for him to transport\r\nhimself from place to place. It matters not how great the velocity of\r\nhis movement, _time_ is an essential ingredient to all motion, whether\r\nrapid or slow. It differs from other matter in the superiority of\r\nits powers, being intelligent, all-wise, and possessing the property\r\nof self-motion to a far greater extent than the coarser materials of\r\nnature. ‘God is a spirit;’ but that does not make him an immaterial\r\nbeing, a being that has no properties in common with matter.”...\r\n\r\n“All the foregoing statements in relation to the person of the Father\r\nare equally applicable to the person of the Son.\r\n\r\n“The Holy Spirit, being one part of the Godhead, is also a material\r\nsubstance, of the same nature and properties in many respects as\r\nthe Spirits of the Father and Son. It exists in vast, immeasurable\r\nquantities, in connection with all material worlds. This is called\r\nGod in the Scriptures, as well as the Father and Son. God the Father\r\nand God the Son can not be every where present; indeed, they can not\r\nbe even in two places at the same instant; but God the Holy Spirit is\r\nomnipresent: it extends through all space, intermingling with all other\r\nmatter, yet no one atom of the Holy Spirit can be in two places at\r\nthe same instant, which in all cases is an absolute impossibility. It\r\nmust exist in inexhaustible quantities, which is the only possible way\r\nfor any substance to be omnipresent. All the innumerable phenomena of\r\nuniversal nature are produced in their origin by the actual presence\r\nof this intelligent, all-wise, and all-powerful material substance\r\ncalled the Holy Spirit. It is the most active matter in the universe,\r\nproducing all its operations according to fixed and definite laws\r\nenacted by itself, in conjunction with the Father and the Son. What\r\nare called the laws of nature are nothing more nor less than the fixed\r\nmethod by which this spiritual matter operates. Each atom of the Holy\r\nSpirit is intelligent, and, like other matter, has solidity, form, and\r\nsize, and occupies space. Two atoms of this Spirit can not occupy the\r\nsame space at the same time, neither can one atom, as before stated,\r\noccupy two separate spaces at the same time. In all these respects it\r\ndoes not differ in the least from all other matter. Its distinguishing\r\ncharacteristics from other matter are its almighty powers and infinite\r\nwisdom, and many other glorious attributes which other materials do not\r\npossess. If several of the atoms of this Spirit should exist united\r\ntogether in the form of a person, then this person of the Holy Spirit\r\nwould be subject to the same necessity” (N.B., this out-anagkes anagke)\r\n“as the other two persons of the Godhead--that is, it could not be\r\nevery where present. No finite number of atoms can be omnipresent. An\r\ninfinite number of atoms is requisite to be _every where_ in infinite\r\nspace. Two persons receiving the gift of the Holy Spirit do not\r\nreceive at the same time the same identical particles, though they each\r\nreceive a substance exactly similar in kind. It would be as impossible\r\nfor them to receive the same identical atoms at the same instant as it\r\nwould be for two men at the same time to drink the same identical pint\r\nof water.”\r\n\r\n[MIND AND MATTER.]\r\n\r\nI will offer another instance of the danger of meddling with such edged\r\ntools as mind and matter--concerning which mankind knows nothing beyond\r\ncertain properties--in the following answer addressed by Mr. Pratt\r\nto the many who have been “traditionated in the absurd doctrines of\r\nimmaterialism.” “The resemblance between man and God has reference, as\r\nwe have already observed, to the shape or figure: other qualities may\r\nor may not resemble each other. Man has legs, so has God, as is evident\r\nfrom his appearance to Abraham. Man walks with his legs; so does God\r\nsometimes, as is evident from his going with Abraham toward Sodom. God\r\ncan not only walk, but he can move up or down through the air without\r\nusing his legs as in the process of walking (Gen., xvii., 22, and xi.,\r\n5, and xxxv., 13)--‘a man wrestled with Jacob until the breaking of\r\nday;’ after which Jacob says, ‘I have seen God face to face, and my\r\nlife is preserved’ (Gen., xxxii., 24-30). That this person had legs is\r\nevident from his wrestling with Jacob. His image and likeness was so\r\nmuch like man’s, that Jacob at first supposed him to be a man. God,\r\nthough in the figure of a man, has many powers that man has not got. He\r\ncan go upward through the air. He can waft himself from world to world\r\nby his own self-moving powers. These are powers not possessed by man,\r\nonly through faith, as in the instances of Enoch and Elijah. Therefore,\r\nthough in the figure of a man, he has powers far superior to man.”\r\n\r\nThis part of the subject may profitably be concluded by quoting the\r\nvenerable adage, “_Qui nescit ignorare nescit sciri_.”\r\n\r\n[MORMON DOXOLOGY.]\r\n\r\nI now offer to the reader a few remarks upon the fourteen articles\r\nof the Mormon doxology,[208] leaving him to settle whether it be a\r\nkakodoxy or a kakistodoxy.\r\n\r\n  [208] From an article published in the “Frontier Guardian,” then\r\n  edited by the Apostle Orson Hyde.\r\n\r\n  I. “WE BELIEVE IN GOD, THE ETERNAL FATHER, AND HIS SON JESUS CHRIST,\r\n  AND IN THE HOLY GHOST.”--Of the thousand sects and systems that have\r\n  used this venerable Kalmah or formula of Christian faith, none have\r\n  interpreted it more peculiarly than the Mormons.\r\n\r\n  The First Person is a perfected man, once a dweller upon earth:\r\n  advancing in intelligence and power, he became such that in\r\n  comparison with man he may be called the Infinite. Mr. Joseph Smith,\r\n  in his last sermon preached at Nauvoo, thus develops his remarkable\r\n  anthropomorphosis: “First, God himself, who sits enthroned in yonder\r\n  heavens, is a man like one of yourselves; that is the great secret.\r\n  If the veil was rent to-day, and the great God who holds this world\r\n  in its orbit, and upholds all things by his power, if you were to see\r\n  him to-day, you would see him in all the person, image, and very form\r\n  as a man; for Adam was created in the very fashion and image of God;\r\n  Adam received instruction, walked, talked, and conversed with Him, as\r\n  one man talks and communes with another.”\r\n\r\n  The Second Person is the “Son Jesus Christ,” the material offspring\r\n  of the First by the Virgin Mary, who was duly married, after\r\n  betrothal by the angel Gabriel, to the Eternal Father, on the\r\n  plains of Palestine: the Holy Babe was the “tabernacle” prepared\r\n  for and assumed by the Spirit Son. The Son is the Creator: when in\r\n  the material spirit still, he took of the “unformed chaotic matter\r\n  element which had an existence from the time God had, and in which\r\n  dwells all the glory,” and formed and peopled this planetary world,\r\n  which he afterward redeemed. He is to be worshiped as Lord of all,\r\n  heir of the Father in power, creation, and dominion. “What did Jesus\r\n  do?” “Why, I do the things that I saw my Father do when worlds came\r\n  rolling into existence. I saw my Father work out his kingdom with\r\n  fear and trembling, and I must do the same.” (“Last Sermon,” p. 61.)\r\n\r\n  The Paraclete has already been described: it differs from the other\r\n  two Persons in being a merely spirit-material soul or existence\r\n  without a “tabernacle.” Thus the Mormons mingle with a Trinity a very\r\n  distinct, though not a conflicting Duality.\r\n\r\n  The Mormon Godhead may be illustrated by a council composed of\r\n  three men, possessing equal wisdom, knowledge, and truth, together\r\n  with equal qualifications in every other respect: each would be a\r\n  separate person or a substance distinct from the other two, and\r\n  yet the three would compose but one body. This body consists of\r\n  three, viz., Eloheim, Jehovah, and Michael, which is Adam. From the\r\n  Christian apostles and the Apocalypse, the Mormons deduce the dogma\r\n  of gods in an _ad infinitum_ ascending series: man, however, must\r\n  limit his obedience to the last heavenly Father and Son revealed by\r\n  the Holy Spirit. And as God is perfect man, so is perfect man God:\r\n  any individual, by faith and obedience, can, as the Brahminical\r\n  faith asserts, rise to the position of a deity, until, attaining\r\n  the power of forming a planet, peopling, redeeming it, and sitting\r\n  there enthroned in everlasting power. The Mormons, like the Moslems,\r\n  believe that--“things of earth, customs, and ceremonies, being\r\n  patterned after things in the Spirit world and future abodes of the\r\n  gods”--there are inferior glories and pleasures for “hewers of wood\r\n  and drawers of water.” In the eternal heavens there are three great\r\n  mansions, the celestial of the sun, the celestial of the stars, and\r\n  the terrestrial: the other state is called the Lake of Fire, or the\r\n  Burning Caldron.\r\n\r\n  II. “WE BELIEVE THAT MEN WILL BE PUNISHED FOR THEIR OWN SINS, AND\r\n  NOT FOR ADAM’S TRANSGRESSIONS.”--Yet the Mormons hold the Son to\r\n  be necessary to reconcile fallen man to the Father and the Holy\r\n  Spirit, to sanctify and purify the affections of men, and also to\r\n  dwell in them as a teacher of truth. “The spiritual substance of man\r\n  was formed in the beginning after the same image as the spiritual\r\n  substance of the persons of the Father and the Son. Previously to\r\n  the fall, these spirits were all moral in their nature; by the fall\r\n  the spirits of men lost their morality and virtue, but not their\r\n  essence--that continued the same: by the new birth man regains\r\n  his morality and virtue, while the essence remains the same; it\r\n  now becomes a moral, virtuous image, whereas the same substance\r\n  was before immoral. Paul (1 Cor., xv., 49), in speaking of the\r\n  resurrection, says, ‘As we have borne the image of the earthly, let\r\n  us bear also the image of the heavenly!’” Unlike the more advanced\r\n  faiths--El Islam and Unitarianism--the Mormons retain the doctrine\r\n  of a “fall.” It contrasts strangely with their dogma of man’s\r\n  perfectibility. They have not attempted to steer clear between the\r\n  Scylla and Charybdis of predestination and free will.\r\n\r\n  III. “WE BELIEVE THAT THROUGH THE ATONEMENT OF CHRIST ALL MANKIND\r\n  MAY BE SAVED BY OBEDIENCE TO THE LAWS AND ORDINANCES OF THE\r\n  GOSPEL.”--After Adam had fallen from his primal purity, a council was\r\n  held in heaven to debate how man should be saved or redeemed from the\r\n  state of evil. The elder brother Lucifer, son of the morning, the\r\n  bright star in glory, and the leader of heavenly hosts, declared,\r\n  when appealed to, that he would save man in his sins. But he who is\r\n  emphatically called “the Son”--Christ--answered, I will save him\r\n  _from_ his sins. Lucifer, the “archangel ruined,” rebelled, was cast\r\n  out from the planetary abode of the Father, and became, under the\r\n  name of Satan, the great ruler and “head devil” of evil spirits, and\r\n  of the baser sort of imps and _succubi_. I can not say whether in\r\n  their mysteries the Mormons represent Sathanas as the handsome man\r\n  of El Islam, or the horned, tailed, and cloven-footed monster which\r\n  monkish Europe fashioned probably after pagan Pan.\r\n\r\n  IV. “WE BELIEVE THESE ORDINANCES ARE, 1ST. FAITH IN THE LORD JESUS;\r\n  2D. REPENTANCE; 3D. BAPTISM BY IMMERSION FOR THE REMISSION OF SINS;\r\n  4TH. LAYING ON OF HANDS BY THE GIFT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT; 5TH. THE\r\n  LORD’S SUPPER.”--Faith is not only the “evidence of things that\r\n  appear not, the substance of things to be hoped for,” the first\r\n  principle of action, and an exercise of the will in intelligent\r\n  beings toward accomplishing holy works and purposes, with a view to\r\n  celestial glory; it is also the source of power both on earth and\r\n  in heaven. We find that by faith God created the world (Heb., xi.,\r\n  3); and, “take this principle or attribute away from the Deity, he\r\n  would cease to exist.” (“Lectures on Faith,” sec. 1.) “Faith, then,\r\n  is the first great governing principle which has power, dominion,\r\n  and authority over all things.” (Ibid.) Of the second ordinance,\r\n  it was revealed, “Say nothing but repentance unto this generation”\r\n  (“Covenants and Commandments,” sec. 37); a very comprehensive and\r\n  valuable rule to those under whom their brethren must sit. As regards\r\n  the third, the child succeeds its parent in moral responsibility\r\n  at eight years of age, when it must be baptized “in the name of\r\n  the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, Amen,” into the\r\n  Church. Infant baptism is regarded as a Bida’at or innovation--a\r\n  sin. Baptism by immersion--any other method being considered a\r\n  vain ceremony--remits our peccata, but it must be repeated after\r\n  each mortal act. (“Covenants and Commandments,” sec. 2, par. 21.)\r\n  Vicarious baptism for the dead is founded upon St. Paul’s saying\r\n  concerning the fathers, that they can not without us be made perfect,\r\n  and “otherwise what shall they do that are baptized for the dead,\r\n  if the dead rise not again at all? Why are they then baptized for\r\n  them?” (1 Cor., xv., 29.) Immersion in water is the symbol of death,\r\n  emersion of the resurrection, and the baptismal font is a simile\r\n  of the grave; but baptism for the dead is acceptable only in the\r\n  Temple. (“Covenants and Commandments,” sec. 103.) There being a\r\n  probationary state while the earth endures in the Spirit world--the\r\n  purgatorial doctrine of Virgil and others--the dead can by proxy\r\n  “fulfill all righteousness;” and the Saints are enjoined that “the\r\n  greatest responsibility that God has laid upon us is to look after\r\n  our dead;” so Mr. Joseph Smith, in his “Last Sermon,” says, “Every\r\n  man who has got a friend in the eternal world can save him, unless he\r\n  has committed the unpardonable sin; so you can see how you can be a\r\n  Savior.” A man baptized for deceased relations traces back the line\r\n  to one that held the priesthood among his progenitors, who, being a\r\n  saint, will take the place of sponsor, and relieve him of farther\r\n  responsibility. All thus admitted to salvation will be added at the\r\n  resurrection to the household of the baptized person, who will reign\r\n  as a patriarch forever, his rank and power among kingly spirits being\r\n  proportioned to his wives and his children--adopted or begotten--and\r\n  his baptizées. The fourth ordinance, or laying on of hands by the\r\n  water’s side, is a perfection of the regeneration begun in baptism,\r\n  and whereby the recipient is promoted to the Melchisedek priesthood;\r\n  the order was revealed, or rather renewed, in 1831. (“Covenants and\r\n  Commandments,” sec. 66.) The fifth ordinance, touching the Eucharist,\r\n  is instituted “in remembrance of the Lord Jesus:” the elder or priest\r\n  administers it kneeling with the Church, praying and blessing first\r\n  the bread and then the wine. (“Covenants and Commandments,” sec.\r\n  2.) The second element was changed by a direct revelation (Sept.,\r\n  1830), saying, “You shall not purchase wine nor strong drink of your\r\n  enemies,” since which time water has been substituted. Mormons, young\r\n  and old, equally take the sacrament every Sabbath.\r\n\r\n  V. “WE BELIEVE THAT MAN MUST BE CALLED OF GOD BY INSPIRATION, AND BY\r\n  LAYING ON OF HANDS FROM THOSE WHO ARE DULY COMMISSIONED TO PREACH THE\r\n  GOSPEL AND ADMINISTER IN THE ORDINANCES THEREOF.”--The Mormons hold\r\n  to a regular apostolic succession. “Every elder” (which includes the\r\n  apostles), “priest, teacher, or deacon, is to be ordained according\r\n  to the gifts and callings of God unto him; and he is to be ordained\r\n  by the power of the Holy Ghost, which is the one who ordains him.”\r\n\r\n  VI. “WE BELIEVE IN THE SAME ORGANIZATION THAT EXISTED IN THE\r\n  PRIMITIVE CHURCH, VIZ., APOSTLES, PROPHETS, PASTORS, EVANGELISTS,\r\n  ETC.”--The proper signification of these words will be explained when\r\n  treating of the Mormon hierarchy.\r\n\r\n  VII. “WE BELIEVE IN THE POWERS AND GIFTS OF THE EVERLASTING\r\n  GOSPEL, VIZ., THE GIFT OF FAITH, DISCERNING OF SPIRITS, PROPHECY,\r\n  REVELATIONS, VISIONS, HEALING, TONGUES, AND THE INTERPRETATION OF\r\n  TONGUES, WISDOM, CHARITY, BROTHERLY LOVE, ETC.”--The everlasting\r\n  Gospel means the universal order and arrangement of things springing\r\n  from the “two self-existing principles of intelligence and element,\r\n  or matter,” and forming the law under which the primordial gods\r\n  came into being. According to Mr. Joseph Smith, “God himself could\r\n  not create himself,” and “Intelligence exists upon a self-existent\r\n  principle: it is a spirit from age to age, and there is no creation\r\n  about it.” In the far eternity two of the elementary material æons\r\n  met, compared intelligence, and calling in a third to council, united\r\n  in what became the first power, superior because prior to all others,\r\n  and ever-enduring by the union of other æons. Under this union arose\r\n  a “law governing itself and all things”--the everlasting Gospel.\r\n  The seer has not left on record the manner in which the head god\r\n  originated: the other gods, however, sprung from him as children.\r\n  Heaven has not only kings, but queens--the Sakti of Hindooism, and\r\n  the various Ario-pagan faiths--who are the mothers of gods, of men’s\r\n  souls, and of all spiritual existences. St. John saw a portion of\r\n  the everlasting Gospel in the “little book” in the hand of the angel\r\n  “coming down from heaven” to proclaim again on earth the Church of\r\n  Christ, a type of Moroni, who taught the fullness of knowledge to\r\n  Joseph the Seer, that the gladder tidings might be preached to men\r\n  with the “signs following” which were promised to the primitive\r\n  apostles.\r\n\r\n  As regards the discerning of spirits, the human soul is not visible\r\n  to mortal eyes without a miracle, nor is it ponderable: it passes\r\n  through the body as the electric fluid through the earth. Yet, in\r\n  reality, it is more substantial than the body, for it can not be\r\n  changed nor destroyed; it “coexisted equal with God,” and had no\r\n  beginning, which would argue the possibility of an end, and “it is\r\n  immortal as God himself.” It is uncreate: “God never did have power\r\n  to create the spirit of man at all--the very idea lessens man in\r\n  my estimation--I know better.” (“Last Sermon,” p. 62.) Spiritual\r\n  existences have a choice of two paths. Either they must remain\r\n  cribbed, cabined, and confined in their own ethereal order and proper\r\n  sphere, to be called and sent as angels, heralds, or ministers from\r\n  one planet or planetary system to another; and thus the Mormon, as\r\n  the Moslem, places angelic nature below human, saying with St. Paul\r\n  (1 Cor., vi., 3), “Know you not that we shall judge angels?” or they\r\n  may choose, like the precreated spirits of El Islam in the Yaum i\r\n  Alast--the Day of Am-I-Not (thy God)?--the probation of an earthly\r\n  tabernacle; and, ignoring their past existence, descend below all\r\n  things to attain a higher than celestial glory, and perfection in\r\n  the attributes of power and happiness. As with the metempsychosist,\r\n  there are grades of tabernacles. The lowest of humans is the African,\r\n  who, being a “servant of servants unto his brethren,” is “cursed as\r\n  to the priesthood,” and therefore can not “attain to any thing above\r\n  a dim-shining glory.” Above him is the Indian, for the Red Men,\r\n  through repentance, obedience, and acceptance of the new Evangelism,\r\n  can rebecome a “fair and delightsome people,” worthy of their Hebrew\r\n  sires. Below the negro is the brute tabernacle, into which the still\r\n  rebellious spirit descends, until, yielding to Gospel law, it is\r\n  permitted to retrace its course through the successive changes to\r\n  splendor and perfection. So, “when we are tormented by a refractory\r\n  horse or an obstinate ass, it may not be amiss to reflect that they\r\n  were actuated by an apostate soul, and exemplifying a few of the\r\n  human infirmities.” The same words might be spoken orthodoxically by\r\n  a Jain or a Banyan.\r\n\r\n  The soul is supposed to take possession of the tabernacle at the\r\n  quickening of the embryon. At baptism the Saint may ask in faith for\r\n  some particular spirit or genius--an idea familiar to the adepts and\r\n  spiritualists of this generation. Every one also has evil, false,\r\n  and seducing spirits at variance with the good, a fancy reminding\r\n  us of the poetical Moslem picture of the good guardian sitting upon\r\n  man’s right shoulder, and whispering into his ear suggestions against\r\n  which the bad spirit on the left contends. Revelations are received\r\n  by prayer and mighty faith, but only when diligence and sagacity fail\r\n  to secure the desired information--where God has appointed means he\r\n  will not work by miracles, nor will a “_de profundis_” act without a\r\n  more concrete action. Heavenly communications vouchsafed to the seer\r\n  must be registered, and kept for promulgation when the Saints can\r\n  bear them; for many “would be offended and turn back if the whole\r\n  truth”--polygamy, for instance--“were dashed down in a mass before\r\n  them.” Of prophetic times it may be observed that the habitat of\r\n  God the Father is the planet Kolob, whose revolutions--one of which\r\n  is the beginning and the end of a day equal to 1000 terrestrial\r\n  years--are the measure of heavenly time. The Deity, being finite,\r\n  employs agents and auxiliaries, _e. g._, light, sound, electricity,\r\n  inspiration, to communicate knowledge to his world of worlds. An\r\n  angel commissioned as a messenger to earth is taken either from the\r\n  chief or from a minor planet, and it naturally measures time by the\r\n  days and weeks, the months and years, of its own home--a style of\r\n  computation which must not a little confuse our poor human chronology.\r\n\r\n  “Tongues” does not signify, as at the date of the first Pentecost,\r\n  an ability to address heteroglottists in their several languages,\r\n  which would render the gift somewhat too precise and Mezzofantian\r\n  for these days. It means that man moved by the Spirit shall utter\r\n  any set of sounds unintelligible even to himself, but which, being\r\n  known to the Lord, may, by special permission to exercise the “gift\r\n  of interpretation of tongues,” be explained by another to those\r\n  addressed. The man gravid with “tongues” must “rise on his feet,\r\n  lean in faith on Christ, and open his lips, utter a song in such\r\n  cadence as he chooses, and the Spirit of the Lord will give an\r\n  interpreter, and make it a language.” The linguistic feat has of late\r\n  years been well known in England, where it was, of course, set down\r\n  to imposture. It may more charitably be explained by an abnormal\r\n  affection of the organ of language on the part of the speaker of\r\n  “tongues,” and in the interpreter by the effect of a fervent and\r\n  fooling faith.\r\n\r\n  [INTERPRETATION OF SCRIPTURE.]\r\n\r\n  VIII. “WE BELIEVE THE WORD OF GOD RECORDED IN THE BIBLE; WE ALSO\r\n  BELIEVE THE WORD OF GOD RECORDED IN THE BOOK OF MORMON, AND IN ALL\r\n  OTHER GOOD BOOKS.”--Some Christians have contended that the Biblia\r\n  of the Jews have been altered; that the last chapter (verse 5) of\r\n  Deuteronomy, for instance, recording the death and burial of Moses,\r\n  was not written by Moses. The Moslems assert that the Scripture of\r\n  both Hebrew and Christian has not only been misunderstood, but has\r\n  designedly been corrupted by Baulús (St. Paul) and other Greekish\r\n  Jews; that the Gospel of Infancy, and the similar compositions now\r\n  banished into the apocryphal New Testament, are mere excrescences\r\n  upon the pure commands of Jesus. The Mormons hold with the latter.\r\n  They believe, however, that the infinite errors and interpretations\r\n  have been removed by “Joseph the Seer,” to whom was given the “key\r\n  of all languages”--he has quoted in his writings only 15 out of\r\n  3500--and the following specimen of his ultra-Bentleian emendations,\r\n  borrowed from the “Last Sermon,” may suffice:\r\n\r\n  “I will make a comment on the very first sentence of the history of\r\n  the creation in the Bible” (_i.e._, “in King James’s version;” he\r\n  had probably never seen even the Douay translation). “It first read,\r\n  ‘The head one of the gods brought forth the gods.’[209] If you do\r\n  not believe it, you do not believe _the learned_ man of God. And,\r\n  in farther explanation, it means, ‘The head god called together the\r\n  gods, and sat in grand council. The grand councilors sat in yonder\r\n  heavens, and contemplated the worlds that were created at that time.’\r\n  The Bible is, therefore, held to be the foundation book.” Mr. Joseph\r\n  Smith’s inspired translation or impudent _rifacciamento_ is believed\r\n  to exist in MS.: in due time it will probably be promulgated. But\r\n  the Word of God is not confined to the Bible; the Book of Mormon and\r\n  the Doctrines and Covenants are of equal authority, strands of the\r\n  “three-fold cord,” connecting by the Church God and man. If these\r\n  revelations contradict one another, the stumbling-block to the weak\r\n  in faith is easily removed by considering the “situations” under\r\n  which they were vouchsafed: “heaven’s government is conducted on\r\n  the principle of adapting revelation to the varied circumstances of\r\n  the children of the kingdom”--a dogma common to all revelationists.\r\n  Additional items may be supplied to the Mormons from day to day, a\r\n  process by which a “flood of light has poured into their souls, and\r\n  raised them to a view of the glorious things above.” The present\r\n  seer, revelator, translator, and prophet, however, shows his high\r\n  wisdom by seeing, revealing, translating, and prophesying as little\r\n  as possible. Yet he even repeats, and probably believes, that\r\n  revelation is the rock upon which the Church is founded.\r\n\r\n  [209] I need hardly say that in the original the words are “at its\r\n  head (beginning) the gods (he) created the earth and the heaven.”\r\n\r\nIX. “WE BELIEVE ALL THAT GOD HAS REVEALED, ALL THAT HE DOES NOW REVEAL,\r\nAND WE BELIEVE THAT HE WILL REVEAL MANY MORE GREAT AND IMPORTANT THINGS\r\nPERTAINING TO THE KINGDOM OF GOD AND MESSIAH’S SECOND COMING.”--Much of\r\nthis has been explained above. The second coming of Christ is for the\r\nrestoration or restitution of all things, as foretold by the prophet\r\nIsaiah. When the living earth was created, the dry land emerged from\r\nthe waters, which gathered by command into one place. The “Voice of\r\nWarning” draws an interesting picture of a state of things hitherto\r\nunknown to geologist and palæogeographer. “There was one vast ocean\r\nrolling around a single immense body of land, unbroken as to continents\r\nand islands; it was a beautiful plain, interspersed with gently rising\r\nhills and sloping vales; its climate delightfully varied with heat and\r\ncold, wet and dry; crowning the year with productions grateful to men\r\nand animals, while from the flowery plain or spicy grove sweet odors\r\nwere wafted on every breeze, and all the vast creation of animated\r\nbeings breathed naught but health, peace, and joy.” Over this paradise,\r\nthis general garden, “man reigned, and talked face to face with the\r\nSupreme, with only a dimming veil between.” After the diffusion of\r\nsin, which followed the fall, came the purification of the Noachian\r\ncataclysm, and in the days of Peleg “the earth was divided,” _i.e._,\r\nthe Homeric circumambient sea was interposed between portions of land\r\nrent asunder, which earthquakes and upheavals subsequently broke into\r\nfragments and islands. We learn from the whole and varied Scriptures\r\nthat before the second coming of Christ the several pieces shall be\r\ndovetailed into one, as they were in the morn of creation, and the\r\nretiring sea shall reassume its pristine place, when Samudra Devta\r\nwas enthroned by the Rishis. The earth is thus restored for a people\r\npurified to innocence, and is fitted for the first resurrection of the\r\nbody to reign with the Savior for a thousand years.\r\n\r\n[RESTORATION OF THE TEN TRIBES.]\r\n\r\nX. “WE BELIEVE IN THE LITERAL GATHERING OF ISRAEL, AND IN THE\r\nRESTORATION OF THE TEN TRIBES; THAT ZION WILL BE ESTABLISHED UPON THE\r\nWESTERN CONTINENT; THAT CHRIST WILL REIGN PERSONALLY UPON THE EARTH\r\nA THOUSAND YEARS; AND THAT THE EARTH WILL BE RENEWED AND RECEIVE\r\nITS PARADISIACAL GLORY.”--The only novelty in this article is the\r\n“location” of Zion, which has already been transferred from Palestine\r\nto the celestial regions in the Valley of the Mississippi; this, in\r\nthe present era, when the old cradles of civilization upon the Ganges\r\nand Indus, the Euphrates and the Nile, have been well-nigh depopulated\r\nor exhausted, promises to become one of the vast hives from which\r\nthe human swarm shall issue. The American continent, as the Book of\r\nMormon informs us, was, at the time of the Crucifixion, shaken to its\r\nfoundation: towns and cities, lakes and mountains, were buried and\r\nformed when “the earth writhed in the convulsive throes of agonizing\r\nnature.” After all the seed of Israel shall have been raised from the\r\ndead, they shall flock to Zion in Judea, and the saints of other races\r\nshall be gathered to New Jerusalem in America: both these cities shall\r\nbe “built with fine stones, and the beauty of all precious things.”\r\nAt the end of the millennium comes the great sabbath of rest and\r\nenjoyment; the earth shall become celestial through the baptism of\r\nfire, while the two holy cities shall be caught up (literally) into\r\nheaven, to descend with the Lord God for their light and their temple,\r\nand shall remain forever on the new earth “under the bright canopy of\r\nthe new heavens.”\r\n\r\nXI. “WE BELIEVE IN THE LITERAL RESURRECTION OF THE BODY, AND THAT\r\nTHE REST OF THE DEAD LIVE NOT AGAIN UNTIL THE THOUSAND YEARS ARE\r\nEXPIRED.”--Man, it has been shown, is a duality of elements. The body\r\nis gross, the spirit--under which the intellect or mind is included--is\r\nrefined matter, permeating, vivifying, and controlling the former:\r\nthe union or fusion of the two constitutes the “living soul” alluded\r\nto by Moses (Gen., ii., 7) in the Adamical creation. Death followed\r\nthe fall of the great patriarch, who, we are told, is called in\r\nScripture Michael, the Ancient of Days, with hair like wool, etc. But\r\nin technical Mormon phrase, “Adam fell that man might be,” and ate the\r\nforbidden fruit with a full foreknowledge of the consequences--a Shiah\r\nbelief. The “fall,” therefore, was a matter of previous arrangement,\r\nin order that spirits choosing to undertake their probations might be\r\nfitted with “tabernacles,” and be born of women. Death separates the\r\nflesh and the spirit for a useful purpose, but the latter keeps guard\r\nover every particle of the former, until, at the fiat of resurrection,\r\nthe body is again “clothed upon,” and perfect man is the result--a\r\ndoctrine familiar to the mediums. Such is also the orthodox Sunnite\r\nfaith. The heretical peculiarity of the Mormon resurrection is this:\r\nthe body will be the same as before, “except the blood,” which is\r\nthe natural life, and, consequently, the principle of mortality. A\r\nman restored to flesh and blood would be subject to death; “flesh\r\nand bones,” therefore, will be the constitution of the “resurrected”\r\nbody. This idea clearly derives from the Genesitic physiology, which\r\nteaches that “the life of the flesh is in the blood” (Levit., xvii.,\r\n14); life being, according to the moderns, not an absolute existence\r\nnor objective entity, but a property or condition of the corporeal\r\nmechanism--the working, as it were, of the engine until arrested by\r\nmaterial lesion. It is confirmed in the Mormon mind by the Savior\r\nbidding his disciples to handle his limbs, and to know that he had\r\nflesh and bones, not blood.\r\n\r\nXII. “WE CLAIM THE PRIVILEGE OF WORSHIPING ALMIGHTY GOD ACCORDING TO\r\nTHE DICTATES OF CONSCIENCE UNMOLESTED, AND ALLOW ALL MEN THE SAME\r\nPRIVILEGE, LET THEM WORSHIP HOW OR WHERE THEY MAY.”--This article\r\nembodies the tenets of Roger Williams, who, in establishing his simple\r\ndemocracy, provided that the will of the majority should rule, but\r\n“only in civil things.” The charter of Rhode Island (1644) contains the\r\nmemorable words: “No person within the said colony shall be molested,\r\npunished, disquieted, or called in question for any differences of\r\nopinion in matters of religion who does not actually disturb the public\r\npeace.” But how often has this been mouthed--how little it has affected\r\nmankind! Would London--boasting in the nineteenth century to be the\r\nmost tolerant of cities--allow the Cardinal of Westminster to walk in\r\nprocession through her streets?\r\n\r\nXIII. “WE BELIEVE IN BEING SUBJECT TO KINGS, QUEENS, PRESIDENTS,\r\nRULERS, AND MAGISTRATES, IN OBEYING, HONORING, AND SUSTAINING THE\r\nLAW.”--When treating of the hierarchy, it will be made apparent that\r\nsubjection to temporals and Gentiles must be purely nominal. At the\r\nsame time, it must be owned that, throughout North America, I may\r\nsay throughout the New World, the Mormon polity is the only fixed\r\nand reasonable form of government. The “turnpike-road of history,”\r\nwhich Fisher Ames, nearly a century ago, described as “white with the\r\ntombstones of republics,” is in a fair way to receive fresh accessions,\r\nwhile the land of the Saints promises continuance and progress.\r\n\r\nXIV. “WE BELIEVE IN BEING HONEST, TRUE, CHASTE, TEMPERATE, BENEVOLENT,\r\nVIRTUOUS, AND UPRIGHT, AND IN DOING GOOD TO ALL MEN; INDEED, WE MAY\r\nSAY THAT WE FOLLOW THE ADMONITION OF PAUL; WE ‘BELIEVE ALL THINGS,’\r\nWE ‘HOPE ALL THINGS,’ WE HAVE ENDURED VERY MANY THINGS, AND HOPE\r\nTO BE ABLE TO ‘ENDURE ALL THINGS.’ EVERY THING LOVELY, VIRTUOUS,\r\nPRAISEWORTHY, AND OF GOOD REPORT, WE SEEK AFTER, LOOKING FORWARD TO\r\nTHE ‘RECOMPENSE OF REWARD.’ BUT AN IDLE OR LAZY PERSON CAN NOT BE A\r\nCHRISTIAN, NEITHER HAVE SALVATION. HE IS A DRONE, AND DESTINED TO BE\r\nSTUNG TO DEATH, AND TUMBLED OUT OF THE HIVE.”--All over the American\r\nUnion there is an apotheosis of labor; the Latter-Day Saints add to it\r\nthe damnation of osiosity.\r\n\r\n[MORMON “AGGLOMERATION.”]\r\n\r\nThis brief outline of Mormon faith will show its strange, but, I\r\nbelieve, spontaneous agglomeration of tenets which, were its disciples\r\nof a more learned and philosophical body, would suggest extensive\r\neclecticism. But, as I have already remarked, there is a remarkably\r\nnarrow limit to religious ideas: the moderns vainly attempt invention\r\nwhen combination is now the only possible process. In the Tessarakai\r\nDecalogue above quoted, we find syncretized the Semitic Monotheism,\r\nthe Persian Dualism, and the Triads and Trinities of the Egyptians and\r\nthe Hindoos. The Hebrews also have a personal Theos, the Buddhists\r\navataras and incarnations, the Brahmans self-apotheosis of man by\r\nprayer and penance, and the East generally holds to quietism, a belief\r\nthat repose is the only happiness, and to a vast complication of\r\nstates in the world to be. The Mormons are like the Pythagoreans in\r\ntheir precreation, transmigration, and exaltation of souls; like the\r\nfollowers of Leucippus and Democritus in their atomic materialism; like\r\nthe Epicureans in their pure atomic theories, their _summum bonum_, and\r\ntheir sensuous speculations; and like the Platonists and Gnostics in\r\ntheir belief of the Æon, of ideas, and of moving principles in element.\r\nThey are fetichists in their ghostly fancies, their evestra, which\r\nbecame souls and spirits. They are Jews in their theocracy, their ideas\r\nof angels, their hatred of Gentiles, and their utter segregation from\r\nthe great brotherhood of mankind. They are Christians inasmuch as they\r\nbase their faith upon the Bible, and hold to the divinity of Christ,\r\nthe fall of man, the atonement, and the regeneration. They are Arians\r\ninasmuch as they hold Christ to be “the first of God’s creatures,” a\r\n“perfect creature, but still a creature.” They are Moslems in their\r\nviews of the inferior status of womankind, in their polygamy, and in\r\ntheir resurrection of the material body: like the followers of the\r\nArabian Prophet, they hardly fear death, because they have elaborated\r\n“continuation.” They take no leap in the dark; they spring from this\r\nsublunary stage into a known, not into an unknown world: hence also\r\ntheir worship is eminently secular, their sermons are political or\r\ncommercial, and--religion being with them not a thing apart, but a\r\nportion and parcel of every-day life--the intervention of the Lord\r\nin their material affairs becomes natural and only to be expected.\r\nTheir visions, prophecies, and miracles are those of the Illuminati,\r\ntheir mysticism that of the Druses, and their belief in the Millennium\r\nis a completion of the dreams of the Apocalyptic sects. Masonry has\r\nevidently entered into their scheme; the Demiurgus whom they worship is\r\n“as good at mechanical inventions as at any other business.” With their\r\nlater theories, Methodism, Swedenborgianism--especially in its view of\r\nthe future state--and Transcendentalism are curiously intermingled.\r\nAnd, finally, we can easily discern in their doctrine of affinity of\r\nminds and sympathy of souls the leaven of that faith which, beginning\r\nwith the Mesmer, and progressing through the Rochester Rappers and the\r\nPoughkeepsie Seer, threatens to extend wherever the susceptible nervous\r\ntemperament becomes the characteristic of the race.\r\n\r\nThe Latter-Day Saints do not deny this agglomeration.[210] They\r\nmaintain that, being guided by the Spirit unto all truth, they have\r\nsifted it out from the gross mass of error that obscures it, and\r\nthat whatever knowledge has been vouchsafed to man may be found in\r\ntheir possession. They assert that other sects were to them what the\r\nPlatonists and the Essenes were to Christianity. Moreover, as has been\r\nseen, they declare their faith to be still in its infancy, and that\r\nmany dark and doubtful subjects are still to be decided by better\r\nexperience or revelation.\r\n\r\n  [210] “One of the grand fundamental principles of Mormonism” (says\r\n  Mr. Joseph Smith in his sermon preached on the 9th of July, 1843) “is\r\n  to receive truth, come whence it may.”... “Presbyterians, Baptists,\r\n  Methodists, Catholics, Mohammedans, etc., are they in possession of\r\n  any truth? Yes, they have all a little truth mixed with error. We\r\n  ought to gather together all the good and true principles which are\r\n  in the world, and keep them, otherwise we shall never become pure\r\n  Mormons.”\r\n\r\nI borrow the following _résumé_ of Mormonism from Lieutenant\r\nGunnison--a Christian writer--of course, without endorsing any one of\r\nhis opinions.\r\n\r\n“In Mormonism we recognize an intuition of Transcendentalism--intuition,\r\nwe say, for its founder was no scholar in the idealistic philosophy. He\r\ntrampled under foot creeds and formulas, and soared away for perpetual\r\ninspiration from the God; and by the will, which he calls faith, he won\r\nthe realms of truth, beauty, and happiness. Such things can only be\r\nsafely confided to the strong and pure-minded, and even they must\r\nisolate themselves in self-idolatry, and be ‘alone with the alone,’ and\r\nseek converse with the spirit of man’s spirit.\r\n\r\n“But this prophet was educated by passion, and sought to be social\r\nwith the weak; he therefore baptized spiritually in the waters of\r\nmaterialism. Instead of evolving the godlike nature of the human\r\nspirit, he endeavored to prove that humanity was already divinity by\r\ninvesting Deity with what is manlike--men were to be like gods by\r\nmaking gods men.”\r\n\r\n[MELCHISEDEK PRIESTHOOD.]\r\n\r\nThe form of Mormon government is not new: it is the theocracy of the\r\nJews, of the Jesuit missions in Brazil, Paraguay, and elsewhere, and\r\nbriefly of all communities in which, contrary to the fitness of things,\r\nChurch is made to include, or, rather, exclude State. In opposition to\r\nEl Islam, they maintain that a hieratic priesthood is necessary to the\r\nwell-being of a religion. They divide it into two grand heads, of which\r\nall other officers and authorities are appendages. The first is called\r\nthe Melchisedek priesthood, “because Melchisedek was such a great\r\nhigh priest.”[211] The second, which is a supplement to the former,\r\nand administers outward ordinances, is the Aaronic or Levitical,\r\n“because it was conferred upon Aaron and his seed throughout all their\r\ngenerations.” To the Melchisedek belong the high priest, priests, and\r\nelders; to the Aaronic the bishops, the teachers or catechists, and the\r\ndeacons.\r\n\r\n  [211] These and the following quotations are borrowed from sections 2\r\n  and 3 of “Covenants and Commandments.”\r\n\r\n“The power and authority of the higher, or Melchisedek priesthood, is\r\nto hold the keys of all the spiritual blessings of the Church, to have\r\nthe privilege of receiving the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, to\r\nhave the heavens opened unto them, to commune with the general assembly\r\nand Church of the first-born, and to enjoy the communion and presence\r\nof God the Father, and Jesus the Mediator of the New Covenant.\r\n\r\n“The power and authority of the lesser, or Aaronic priesthood, is\r\nto hold the keys of the ministering of angels, and to administer in\r\noutward ordinances the letter of the Gospel--the baptism of repentance\r\nfor the remission of sins--agreeable to the covenants and commandments.”\r\n\r\nThe apex of the Mormon hierarchy is the First Presidency, now Messrs.\r\nYoung, Kimball, and Wells, who have succeeded to Peter, James, and\r\nJohn in the Gospel Church, and who correspond on earth to the Trinity\r\nin heaven--_numero Deus impare gaudet_. The presiding high priest over\r\nthe high priesthood of the Church--_par excellence_, “_the_” President,\r\nalso _ex-officio_ seer, revelator, translator, and prophet, is supreme.\r\nThe two sub-chiefs or counselors are _quasi_-equal: the first, however,\r\ntakes social precedence of the second. This quorum of the presidency\r\nof the Church, elected by the whole body, is the centre of temporal as\r\nof ecclesiastical power. It claims, under God, the right of life and\r\ndeath; it holds the keys of heaven and hell, and from its decrees there\r\nis no appeal except to the general assembly of all the quorums which\r\nconstitute the spiritual authorities of the Church.\r\n\r\nThe second in rank is the Patriarch. The present incumbent is a nephew\r\nof the first seer, who succeeded Mr. Joseph Smith, sen., the father of\r\nMr. Joseph Smith, jun.[212] As the sire of the Church, his chief duty\r\nis to administer blessings: it is an office of dignity held for life,\r\nwhereas all others expire after the semestre.\r\n\r\n  [212] So called in revelation until the death of Mr. Joseph Smith,\r\n  sen.\r\n\r\nFollows the “Second Presidency,” the twelve traveling counselors,\r\n“called to be the twelve apostles or special witnesses of the name of\r\nChrist in all the world,” modeled with certain political modifications\r\nafter the primitive Christian Church, and abbreviatively termed “The\r\nTwelve.” The President of the High Apostolic College, or, in his\r\ndefault, one of the members, acts as coadjutor, in the absence of a\r\nmember of the First Presidency. The Twelve come nearer the masses, and,\r\nacting under direction of the highest authority, build up the Church,\r\nordain and set in order all other officers, elders, priests, teachers,\r\nand deacons: they are empowered to baptize, and to administer bread and\r\nwine--the emblems of the flesh and blood of Christ; to confirm those\r\nwho are baptized into the Church by the laying on of hands for the\r\nbaptism of fire and the Holy Ghost; to teach, expound, exhort, baptize,\r\nand watch over the Church, and to take the lead in all meetings. They\r\npreside over the several “Stakes of Zion;” there is one, for instance,\r\nto direct, under the title of president, the European, and another the\r\nLiverpool mission. If there be several together, the eldest is the\r\nstanding president of the quorum, and they act as councilors to one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThe fourth body in rank is the Seventies. The “Seventy” act in the\r\nname of the Lord, under direction of the “Twelve,” in building up\r\nthe Church, and, like them, are traveling ministers, sent first to\r\nthe Gentiles, and then to the Jews. Out of the “Seventy” are chosen\r\nseven presidents, of whom one presides over the other six councilors:\r\nthese seven choose other seventy besides the first seventy, “and\r\nalso other seventy, until seven times seventy, if the labor in the\r\nvineyard of necessity requires it.” In 1853 the minutes of the Mormon\r\nGeneral Conference enumerated the “Seventies” at 1572. Practically\r\nthe seventy members are seldom complete. The chief of these traveling\r\npropagandists, the working bees of the community, is the “President of\r\nall the Seventies.”\r\n\r\nThe fifth body is composed of “high priests after the order of the\r\nMelchisedek priesthood, who have a right to officiate in their own\r\nstanding, under the direction of the Presidency, in administering\r\nspiritual things,” and to “officiate in all the offices of the Church\r\nwhen there are no higher authorities present.” Thus charged with the\r\nexecution of spiritual affairs, they are usually aged and fatherly\r\nmen. Among the high priests are included, _ex-officio_, the bishops and\r\nthe high council.\r\n\r\n[THE MORMON BISHOP.]\r\n\r\nThe Mormon επισκοπος is a steward, who renders an account of his\r\nstewardship both in time and eternity, and who superintends the\r\nelders, keeps the Lord’s store-house, receives the funds of the\r\nChurch, administers to the wants of those beneath him, and supplies\r\nassistance to those who manage the “literary concerns,” probably\r\neditors and magazine publishers. The bishopric is the presidency of\r\nthe Aaronic priesthood, and has authority over it. No man has a legal\r\nright to the office except a literal descendant of Aaron. As these,\r\nhowever, are _non inventi_, and as a high priest of the Melchisedek\r\norder may officiate in all lesser offices, the bishop, who never\r\naffects a _nolo episcopari_, can be ordained by the First Presidency,\r\nor Mr. Brigham Young. Thus the episcopate is a local authority in\r\nstakes, settlements, and wards, with the directorship of affairs\r\ntemporal as well as spiritual. This “overseer” receives the tithes on\r\nthe commutation-labor, which he forwards to the public store-house;\r\nsuperintends the registration of births, marriages, and deaths, makes\r\ndomiciliary visits, and hears and determines complaints either laical\r\nor ecclesiastic.\r\n\r\n[THE HIGH COUNCIL.]\r\n\r\nThe High Council was organized by revelation in Kirtland (Feb. 17,\r\n1834) for the purpose of settling, when the Church or the “Bishop’s”\r\ncouncil might fail, important difficulties that might arise between two\r\nbelievers. Revelation directed it to consist of twelve high priests,\r\nascertained by lots or ballot, and one or three presidents, as the case\r\nmight require. The first councilors, when named, were asked if they\r\nwould act in that office according to the law of heaven: they accepted,\r\nand at once, _more Americano_--“voted.” After deciding that the\r\nPresident of the Church should also be President of the Council, it was\r\nlaid down that the duty of the twelve councilors should be to cast lots\r\nby numbers, and thereby ascertain who of the twelve shall speak first,\r\ncommencing with number one, and so in succession to number twelve. In\r\nan easy case only two speak; in a difficult one, six. The defendant has\r\na right to one half of the council, and “those who draw even numbers,\r\nthat is, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12, are the individuals who are to stand\r\nup in behalf of the accused, and to prevent insult or injustice.” After\r\nthe evidence is heard, and the councilors, as well as the accuser\r\nand the accused, have “said their say,” the president decides, and\r\ncalls upon the “twelve” to sanction his decision by their vote. When\r\nerror is suspected, the case is subject to a “careful rehearing;” and\r\nin peculiar difficulties the appeal is to revelation. I venture to\r\nrecommend this form of special jury to those who have lost faith in a\r\ncertain effete and obsolete “palladium of British liberty” that dates\r\nfrom the days of Ethelbert. After all, it is sometimes better, _jurare\r\nin verba magistri_, especially of an inspired master.\r\n\r\nThe High Council is a standing council. It bears the same relationship\r\nto the federal power as the university Sex viri to a court of civil law\r\nin England, and it saves the saints the expense of Gentile proceedings,\r\nwhich may roughly be set down at fifty per cent. The sessions take\r\nplace in the Social Hall. Such an institution, which transfers to St.\r\nPeter all the duties, salaries, and honors which Justinianus gives,\r\nis, of course, most unpopular among the anti-Mormons, who call it\r\nStar-Chamber, and other ugly names. I look upon it rather as the\r\nPunchayat (_quinque viri_) Court of East India, a rough but ready\r\ninstrument of justice, which, like spontaneous growths generally, have\r\nbeen found far superior to the exotic institutions forced upon the\r\npopular mind by professional improvers.\r\n\r\nThe Latter-Day Saint, when in a foreign land, can be punished for\r\ntransgression by his own people. The presiding authority calls a\r\ncouncil to examine the evidence for and against the offense; and if\r\nguilt be proven, the offender, after being officially suspended from\r\nhis missionary functions and the fellowship of the Church, is sent,\r\nwith a special report, to be tried by his own presidency at Great Salt\r\nLake City.\r\n\r\nThe elders are those from whom the apostles are taken; they are, in\r\nfact, promoted priests charged with all the duties of that order, and\r\nwith the conduct of meetings, “as they are led by the Holy Ghost,\r\naccording to the commandments and revelations of God.” They hold\r\nConferences once in every three months, receive their licenses from the\r\nelders or from the Conferences; they are liable to be sent on missions,\r\nand are solemnly enjoined, by a revelation of January, 1832, to “gird\r\nup their loins and be sober.”\r\n\r\nThe priest is the master mason of the order. It is his duty to preach,\r\nteach, expound, exhort, baptize, administer the sacrament, visit\r\ndomiciliarily, exhort the saints to pray “vocally and in secret,”\r\nordain other priests, teachers, and deacons, take the lead of meetings\r\nwhen there is no elder present, and assist the elder when occasion\r\nrequires.\r\n\r\nOf the Aaronic order, the head are the bishops; under them are two\r\nranks, who form the entered apprentices of the Mormon lodge.\r\n\r\n1st. The teachers, who have no authority to baptize, to administer the\r\nsacrament, or to lay on hands, but who “warn, expound, exhort, teach,\r\nand invite all to come unto Christ, watch over the Church, and take\r\nthe lead of meetings in the absence of the elder or priest.” Of these\r\ncatechists one or two is usually attached to each bishop.\r\n\r\n2d. The deacon, or διακονος, an assistant teacher. He also acts as\r\ntreasurer to the missions in the several branches of the Church,\r\ncollects money for the poor, and attends to the temporal wants of\r\nconverts.\r\n\r\nThe rise of the “Church of Christ in these last days dates from 1830,\r\nsince the coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ:” thus, A.D.\r\n1861 is Annus Josephi Smithii 31. In that year Mirabilis the book\r\nof Mormon appeared, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints\r\nwas organized, and the Body Ecclesiastic, after the fashion of those\r\npreceding it, was exodus’d or hegira’d to Kirtland, Ohio.\r\n\r\n[“UPPER CRUST.”]\r\n\r\nThe actual composition of the Mormon hierarchy is that of a cadre\r\nof officers to a skeleton army of saints and martyrs, which may be\r\nfilled up _ad infinitum_. It is inferior in simplicity, and therefore\r\nin power, to that which the Jesuit organization is usually supposed\r\nto be, yet it is not deficient in the wherewithal of a higher grasp.\r\nIt makes state government, especially that of Gentile communities,\r\nan excrescence upon the clerical body. The first president is the\r\ngovernor; the second is the lieutenant governor; the third is the\r\nsecretary of state; the High Council is the Supreme Court; the\r\nbishops are justices of peace: briefly, the Church is legislative,\r\njudiciary, and executive--what more can be required? It has evidently\r\nnot neglected the masonic, monotheistic, and monocratic element, as\r\nopposed to, and likely to temper the tripartite rule of Anglo-American\r\ncivil government. The first president is the worshipful master of the\r\nlodge, the second and third are the senior and junior wardens, while\r\nthe inferior ranks represent the several degrees of the master and\r\napprentice. It symbolizes the leveling tendencies of Christianity\r\nand progressiveism, while its civil and ecclesiastical despotism and\r\nits sharp definition of rank are those of a disciplined army--the\r\nmodel upon which socialism has loved to form itself. In society,\r\nwhile all are brothers, there is a distinct aristocracy, called west\r\nof the Atlantic “upper crust;” not of titles and lands, nor of bales\r\nand boxes, but of hierarchical position; and, contrary to what might\r\nbe expected, there is as little real social fusion among Mormons as\r\nbetween the “sixties,” the “forties,” and the “twenties” of silly\r\nGuernsey.\r\n\r\nHaving now attempted, after the measure of my humble capacity, to\r\nshow what Mormonism is, I will try to explain what Mormonism is not.\r\nThe sage of Norwich (“Rel. Med.,” sect. vi.) well remarked that\r\n“every man is not a proper champion of truth, nor fit to take up the\r\ngauntlet in the cause of verity;” and that “many, from the ignorance\r\nof these maxims, have too rashly charged the troops of error, and\r\nremain as trophies to the enemies of truth.” The doctrine may fitly be\r\nillustrated by pointing out the prodigious aid lent to Mormonism by the\r\nself-inflicted defeats of anti-Mormonism.\r\n\r\n[THE JAREDITE EXODUS.]\r\n\r\nThe Jaredite exodus to America in dish-like “barges, whose length was\r\nthe length of a tree,” and whose voyage lasted 344 days, is certainly a\r\ntrial of faith. The authority of Mormonic inspiration is supposed to be\r\nweakened by its anachronisms and other errors: the mariner’s compass,\r\nfor instance, is alluded to long before the fourteenth century. The\r\nMormons, however, reply that the “Liahona” of their Holy Book is not\r\na compass, and that if it were, nothing could be said against it: the\r\nChinese claim the invention long before the days of Flavio, and the\r\nMoslems attribute it to one of their own saints.[213] The “reformed\r\nEgyptian” of the Golden Bible is ridiculed on the supposition that\r\nthe Hebrew authors would write either in their own tongue, in the\r\nSyrian, or in the Chaldaic, at any rate in a Semitic, not in a Coptic\r\nlanguage. But the first disciples of the Gospel Church were Jews,\r\nand yet the Evangel is now Greek. As regards the Golden Plates, it\r\nis contended that the Jews of old were in the habit of writing upon\r\npapyrus, parchment, and so on, not upon metal, and that such plates\r\nhave never been found in America. But of late years Himyaritic\r\ninscriptions upon brass tablets have been forwarded from Yemen to\r\nthe British Museum. Moreover, in 1843, six brass plates of a bell\r\nshape, covered with ancient glyphs, were discovered by a “respectable\r\nmerchant” near Kinderhook, United States, proving that such material\r\nwas not unknown to the ancient Semites and to the American aborigines.\r\nThe word “Christ” often occurs (“Book of Mormon,” p. 8, etc.) long\r\nbefore the coming of the Savior. But the Book of Mormon was written in\r\nthe “reformed Egyptian:” the proper noun in question was translated\r\n“Christ” in English by the prophet, an “unlearned young man,” according\r\nto his own understanding, and for the better comprehension of his\r\nreaders. The same argument applies to such words as “synagogues,”\r\n“alpha and omega,” “steel,” “S.S.E.,” etc.; also to “elephant,” “cow,”\r\n“horse,” “ass,” “swine,” and other pachyderms and solidunguls, which\r\nwere transported to America after the Columbian discovery: they are\r\nmere translations, like the fabulous unicorn of the Old Testament and\r\nthe phœnix of the apocryphal New Testament (Clement I., xii., 2):\r\nelephant, for instance, manifestly means mastodon, and swine, peccary.\r\nPtolemy’s theory of a moving earth is found anticipated. But who shall\r\nlimit revelation? and has not the Mosaic Genesis, according to a\r\nmultitude of modern divines, anticipated all the latest discoveries?\r\nThe Lord describes America to Jared (“Book of Mormon,” p. 78) as an\r\n“isle of the sea,” and the accuracy of the geography is called in\r\nquestion. But in the Semitic and other Eastern tongues, insula and\r\npeninsula are synonymous. Moreover, if Dr. Kane’s open circumpolar\r\nocean prove aught but a myth, the New World is wholly insulated even by\r\nice from the Old. Other little contradictions and inaccuracies, which\r\nabound in the inspired books, are as easily pooh-pooh’d as objections\r\nto the conflicting genealogies, and the contradictory accounts of the\r\nCrucifixion by the professors of the elder faith.\r\n\r\n  [213] First Footsteps in East Africa, chap. i.\r\n\r\n[OBJECTIONS TO MORMONISM.]\r\n\r\nThe “vulgarity” of Mormonism is a favorite theme with the anti-Mormon.\r\nThe low origin and “plebbishness” of the apostles’ names and of their\r\ninstitutions (_e. g._, the “Twelve,” the “Seventies”), the snuffling\r\nPuritanic style which the learned Gibbon hated, and execrable grammar\r\n(_e. g._, in the first page, “Nephi’s brethren rebelleth against him”),\r\nand the various Yankeeisms of the New Scriptures, are cited as palpable\r\nproofs of fraud. But the primitive apostles of Christianity were of\r\ninferior social rank and attainments to the first Mormon converts,\r\nand of the reformers of Luther’s age it may be asked, “Where was\r\nthen the gentleman?” The Syriac-Greek of the New Testament, with its\r\nmanifold flaws of idiom and diction, must have produced upon the polite\r\nphilosophers and grammarians of Greece and Rome an effect even more\r\npainful than that which the Americanisms of the Book of Mormon exercise\r\nupon English nerves. These things are palpably stumbling-blocks\r\ndisposed sleeper-wise upon the railroad of faith, lest Mr. Christian’s\r\nprogress should become a mere excursion. Gentiles naturally feel\r\ndisposed to smile when they find in the nineteenth century prophets,\r\napostles, saints; but the Church only gains by the restoration and\r\nreformation of her primitive discipline. The supernatural action of the\r\nHoly Spirit believed in by the Mormons as by the Seekers (1645), the\r\nCamisards (1688), the Leeites and Wilkinsonians (1776), is the best\r\nanswer to that atheistic school which holds that God who once lived is\r\nnow dead to man. As of the Ayat of El Islam, so of the revelations with\r\nwhich Mr. Joseph Smith was favored, it is remarked that their exceeding\r\nopportuneness excites suspicion. But of what use are such messages\r\nfrom Heaven unless they arrive _à propos_? Mr. O. Hyde contends, after\r\nthe fashion of wiser men, that ambiguity, and, if I may use the word,\r\na certain achronology, characterize inspired prophecy: it is evident\r\nthat only a little more inspiration is wanted to render it entirely\r\nunambiguous.\r\n\r\nThe other sentimental objections to Mormonism may briefly be answered\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n“_That the holiest of words is profanely applied to man._” But as\r\nMoses (Ex., iv., 16) was “instead of God to Aaron” (Ex., vii., 1),\r\nand was “made a god” to Pharaoh, and as the Savior declared that “he\r\ncalled them gods unto whom the word of God came” (John, xi., 35), the\r\nMormons evidently use the word in its old and scriptural sense. Thus\r\nthey assert that Mr. Joseph Smith is the god of this generation, Jesus\r\nis his god, Michael or Adam is the god of Jesus, Jehovah is the god of\r\nAdam, and Eloheim is the god of Jehovah.\r\n\r\n“_That credible persons have testified to the bad character of Mr.\r\nJoseph Smith, junior, as a money-digger, a cheat, a liar, a vulgar\r\nimpostor, or, at best, a sincere and ignorant fanatic._” The Mormons\r\nreply that such has been the history of every prophet. They point\r\nwith triumph and yearning love to the story of their martyr’s life,\r\nto his intense affection for his family, and to their devotion to\r\nhim. They boast of his invincible boldness, energy, enthusiasm, and\r\nmoral courage; that he never flinched from his allotted tasks, from\r\nthe duties which he was commissioned to perform; that he was fifty\r\ntimes dragged by his enemies before the tribunals, and was as often\r\nacquitted; that he never hesitated for a moment, when such act was\r\nnecessary, to cut off from the Church those who, like Oliver Cowdery,\r\nhad been the depositaries of his intimate secrets; that his career\r\nwas one long Bartholomew’s Day, and that his end was as glorious\r\nas his life was beautiful. In America Mr. Joseph Smith has by the\r\ngeneral suffrage of anti-Mormons been pronounced to be a knave, while\r\nhis successor, Mr. Brigham Young, has been declared by the same high\r\nauthority--_vox diaboli_, the Mormons term it--to be a self-deluded\r\nbut true man. I can scarcely persuade myself that great events are\r\nbrought about by mere imposture, whose very nature is feebleness:\r\nzeal, enthusiasm, fanaticism, which are of their nature strong and\r\naggressive, better explain the abnormal action of man on man. On the\r\nother hand, it is impossible to ignore the dear delights of fraud and\r\ndeception, the hourly pleasure taken by some minds in finessing through\r\nlife, in concealing their real selves from the eyes of others, and in\r\nplaying a part till by habit it becomes a nature. In the estimation of\r\nunprejudiced persons Mr. Joseph Smith is a man of rude genius, of high\r\ncourage, of invincible perseverance, fired by zeal, of great tact, of\r\nreligious fervor, of extraordinary firmness, and of remarkable talent\r\nin governing men. It is conceded that, had he not possessed “strong\r\nand invincible faith in his own high pretensions and divine mission,”\r\nhe would probably have renounced the unprofitable task of prophet, and\r\nsought refuge from persecution and misery in private life and honorable\r\nindustry. Be that as it may, he has certainly taken a place among the\r\nnotabilities of the world--he has left a footprint upon the sands of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n“_That Mr. Joseph Smith prophesied lies_,” and that “_through greed of\r\ngain he robbed the public by appropriating the moneys of the Kirtland\r\nBank_.” The Mormons reply that many predictions of undoubted truth\r\nundeniably passed their prophet’s lips, and that some--_e. g._, those\r\nreferring to the Mormon Zion and to the end of the world--may still\r\nprove true. With reference to the fact that Martin Harris was induced\r\nby the seer to pay for the publication of the Book of Mormon, it is\r\npleaded that the Christian apostles (Acts, iv., 35) also received\r\nmoney from their disciples. The failure of the Kirtland Bank (A.D.\r\n1837) is thus explained: During the Prophet’s absence upon a visit\r\nto the Saints at Toronto, the cashier, Warren Parrish, flooded the\r\ndistrict with worthless paper, and, fearing discovery on his master’s\r\nreturn, decamped with $25,000, thereby causing a suspension of payment.\r\nRegarding other peccadilloes, the Mormons remark that no prophet was\r\never perfect or infallible. Moses, for instance, was not suffered for\r\nhis sins to enter the Promised Land, and Saul lost by his misconduct\r\nthe lasting reign over Israel.\r\n\r\n“_That the three original witnesses to the ‘Book of Mormon’ apostatized\r\nand denied its truth._” To this the Mormons add, that after a season\r\nthose apostates duly repented and were rebaptized; one has died; the\r\nsecond, Martin Harris, is now a Saint in Kirtland, Ohio; and the third,\r\nSidney Rigdon, to whom the faith owed so much, left the community after\r\nthe Prophet’s martyrdom, saying that it had chosen the wrong path,\r\nbut never rejecting Mormonism nor accusing it of fraud. The witnesses\r\nto those modern tables of the law (the Golden Plates) were but eleven\r\n_in toto_, and formed only three families interested in the success\r\nof the scheme. The same paucity, or rather absence of any testimony\r\nwhich would be valid in a modern court of justice, marks the birth of\r\nevery new faith, not excluding the Christian. And, finally, wickedness\r\nproved against the witnesses does not invalidate the value of their\r\ndepositions. The disorders in the conduct of David and Solomon, for\r\ninstance, do not affect the inspiration of the Psalms and Canticles.\r\n\r\n“_That Mormon apostles and elders, as Parley P. Pratt and John Taylor,\r\ndenied the existence of polygamy, even after it was known and practiced\r\nby their community._” The Mormons reply that they never attempted to\r\nevade the imputation of the true patriarchal marriage: they merely\r\nasserted their innocence of the “spiritual wifedom,” the Free Loveism\r\nand the Fanny Wrightism of the Eastern States--charges brought against\r\nthem by the anti-Mormons.\r\n\r\nHaving thus disposed of the principal allegations, I will more briefly\r\nallude to the minor.\r\n\r\n“_That the Mormons do not allow monogamy._” This I know not to be the\r\nfact, as several of my acquaintances had and have but one wife. “_That\r\na multitude of saints, prophets, and apostles are in full chase after\r\na woman, whom the absence of her husband releases from her vows; that\r\nthe missionary on duty appoints a proxy or vicarious head to his house,\r\nand that his spouses are married_ pro tempore _to elders and apostles\r\nat home_.” Mrs. Ferris has dreamed out this “abyss of abomination,”\r\nand then uses it to declaim against. But is it at all credible? Would\r\nnot such conduct speedily demoralize and demolish a society which\r\neven its enemies own to be peculiarly pure? “_That the Mormons are\r\n‘jealous fellows’_”--a curious contradiction of the preceding charges.\r\nThe Saints hold to the semi-seclusion of Athens, Rome, and Syria,\r\nwhere “she was the best of women of whom least is said, either of\r\ngood or harm,” believing with the world generally that opportunity\r\noften makes the thief. “_That the Mormons ‘swap,’ sell, exchange, and\r\ntransfer their wives to Indians._” Mrs. Ferris started the story,\r\nwhich carries its own refutation, by chronicling a report of the kind;\r\nand Mr. Ward improves upon it by supplying false instances and names.\r\n“_That the utmost latitude of manners is allowed in the ballroom\r\nand the theatre_,” which are compared to the private _réunions_ of\r\nRosanna Townsend and other Aspasias. The contrary is notoriously the\r\ncase. “_That the young Mormons are frequently guilty of the crimes of\r\nAbsalom and other horrible offenses._” Unprejudiced Gentiles always\r\ndeny the truth of such accusations. “_That the Mormon has no home, and\r\nthat Mormon houses are dirty, slovenly, and uncomfortable._” The Far\r\nWest is not remarkable for neatness: the only exceptions to the rule\r\nof filth which I have seen are in the abodes of the Mormons. “_That\r\n‘plurality-families’ are in a state of perpetual storm._” I believe\r\nthat many a “happy English home” is far stormier, despite the holy\r\npresence of monogamy. Even Mrs. Ferris tells of two wives, one young,\r\nthe other old, “who treated each other with that degree of affectionate\r\ncordiality which properly belongs to the intercourse between mother\r\nand daughter,” and--naïvely wonder-struck by what she could not\r\nunderstand--exclaims, “What a strange spectacle!” “_That women must\r\nbe married to be saved._” The orthodox Mormon belief is that human\r\nbeings are sent into the world to sow seed for heaven; that a woman\r\nwho wittingly, and for stupid social Belgravian-mother motives, fails\r\nin so doing, neglects a vital duty, and that whoso gives not children\r\nto the republic has lived in vain--an opinion which the Saints are\r\ncontented to share with Moses and Mohammed, Augustus Cæsar and Napoleon\r\nBonaparte. “_That the Mormons marry for eternity._” They believe that\r\nAdam and Eve, when wholly pure, were so married, and that redemption\r\nsignifies a complete restoration to all the privileges lost by the\r\nfall. “_That Mormons are ‘sealed’ to rich old women._” The _vetula\r\nbeata_ exists, I believe, almost universally. “_That Mormons marry and\r\nseal for the dead._” As has been seen, it is a principle of faith that\r\nall ordinances for the living may vicariously be performed for those\r\ndeparted. “_That Mormon women are pale, thin, badly and carelessly\r\ndressed, and poorly fed--that they exhibit a sense of depression\r\nand degradation._” I found them exceedingly pretty and attractive,\r\nespecially Miss ----. “_That it is dangerous to be the rival of a\r\nMormon elder in love and business._” This is true only so far that the\r\nSaint is probably a better man than the Gentile. I have been assured by\r\nGentiles that they would rather trust the followers of Mr. Joseph Smith\r\nthan their own people, and that, under Mormon rule, there never has\r\nbeen, and never can be, a case of bankruptcy. The hunters and Indian\r\ntraders dislike the Saints for two chief reasons: in the first place,\r\nthe hunting-grounds have been narrowed; and, secondly, industry and\r\nsobriety have taken the place of rollicking and dare-devilism. “_That\r\nthe Mormons are bigoted and intolerant._” The Mormon’s golden rule is,\r\n“Mind your own business, and let your neighbor mind his.” At Great Salt\r\nLake City I found all the most violent anti-Mormon books, and have\r\noften heard Gentiles talk in a manner which would not be tolerated in\r\nParis, London, and Rome. “_That the Church claims possession of, and\r\nauthority over, a dead disciple’s goods and chattels._” This is done\r\nonly in cases when heirs fail. “_That it is the Mormon’s duty to lay\r\nall his possessions at the apostles’ feet._” The Mormons believe that\r\nthe Lord has ordered his Church to be established on earth; that its\r\nsuccess involves man’s salvation; that the apostles are the pillars\r\nof the sacred edifice, and that the disciple is bound, like Barnabas,\r\nwhen called upon, to lay his all at the apostles’ feet; practically,\r\nhowever, the measure never takes place. “_That the high dignitaries\r\nare enriched by tithes and by plundering the people._” I believe, for\r\nreasons before given, this assertion to be as wholly destitute of fact\r\nas of probability. “_That the elders borrow money from their Gentile\r\ndisciples, and that the Saints ‘milk the Gentiles.’_” The Mormons, like\r\nsensible men, do not deny that their net has drawn up bad fish as well\r\nas good; they assert, however, and I believe with truth, that their\r\ncommunity will bear comparison in point of honesty with any other.\r\n\r\n[POLITICAL OBJECTIONS.]\r\n\r\nI have already remarked how thoroughly hateful to the petulant\r\nfanatical republican of the New World is the Mormon state within state,\r\ntheir absolute aristocracy clothed in the wolf-skin of democracy; and I\r\nhave also shown how little of that “largest liberty,” concerning which\r\nthe traveler in the United States hears so often and sees so seldom,\r\nhas been extended to them or to their institutions. Let us now consider\r\na few of the political objections to Mormonism.\r\n\r\n“_That the Mormon Church overshadows and controverts the actions\r\nand opinions, the property, and even the lives of its members._”\r\nThe Mormons boast that their Church, which is their state, does so\r\nlegitimately, and deny any abuse of its power. “_That the Church\r\nusurps and exercises the legislative and political business of\r\nthe Territory._” The foregoing pages disprove this. “_That the\r\nChurch organizes and commands a military force._” True, for her own\r\nprotection. “_That the Church disposes of public lands on her own\r\nterms._” The Mormons reply that, as squatters, they have earned by\r\ntheir improvements the right of pre-emption, and as the federal\r\ngovernment delays to recognize their title, they approve of the\r\nChurch so doing. “_That the Church has coined money and forced its\r\ncirculation._” The former clause is admitted, and the excellence of\r\nthe Californian gold is warranted; the latter is justly treated with\r\nridicule. “_That the Church levies the tenth part of every thing from\r\nits members under the charge of tithing._” The Mormons derive this\r\npractice from the laws of Moses, and assert that the gift is purely a\r\nfree-will offering estimated by the donor, and never taken except from\r\nthose who are in full communion. “_That the Church imposes enormous\r\ntaxes upon Gentile citizens._” The Mormons own that they levy a large\r\noctroi, in the form of a regulated license system, upon ardent spirits,\r\nbut they deny that more is taken from the Gentile than from the Saint.\r\n“_That the Church supervises and penetrates into the domestic circle,\r\nand enjoins and inculcates obedience to her own counsels, as articles\r\nof faith paramount to all the obligations of society and morality,\r\nallegiance and law._” The Mormons reply that the counsel and the\r\nobligations run in the same grooves.\r\n\r\nMormonism in England would soon have fallen to the level of Leeism\r\nor Irvingism; its teachers to the rank of the Southcoteans and\r\nMuggletonians. Its unparalleled rise and onward march could have\r\ntaken place only in a new hemisphere, in another world. Its genius is\r\nessentially Anglo-American, without one taint of Gallic, Teutonic, or\r\nKeltic. It is Rationalistic: the analytic powers, sharpened by mundane\r\npractice, and wholly unencumbered by religious formal discipline,\r\nare allowed, in things ultra mundane, a scope, a perfect freedom,\r\nthat savors of irreverence: thus the Deity is somewhere spoken of\r\nas a “right-hand man.” It is Exaggerative in matter as in manner:\r\nthe Pentateuch, for instance, was contented with one ark, Mormonism\r\nrequired eight. It is Simplificative: its fondness for facilitation\r\nhas led it through literalism into that complete materialism which,\r\nto choose one point only, makes the Creator of the same species as\r\nhis creature. It is Imitative to an extent that not a vestige of\r\noriginality appears: the Scripture names are carefully moulded in\r\nHebrew shape; and, to quote one of many instances, the death-bed of\r\nthe first patriarch (“Life of Joseph Smith, the Prophet,” chap. xlii.)\r\nis a travestie of that of Israel, with his prayers, prophecies, and\r\nblessings; while the titles of the apostles, _e. g._, Lion of the Lord,\r\nare literally borrowed from El Islam. It has a mystic element the other\r\nside of its severe rationalism, even as the American character mixes\r\ntranscendentalism with the purest literalism, as Mr. Emerson, the Sufi,\r\ncontrasts with the Pilgrim fathers and Sam Slick. It is essentially\r\nPractical, though commonplaces and generalisms are no part of its\r\ncomposition. Finally, it is admirably puffed, as the note upon Mormon\r\nbibliography proves--better advertised than Colonel Colt’s excellent\r\nrevolvers.\r\n\r\nI had proposed to write a chapter similar to this upon the Mormon\r\nannals. After sundry attempts, the idea was abandoned in despair.\r\nIt would be necessary to give two distinct or rather opposite\r\nversions--according to the Mormons and the anti-Mormons--of every\r\nmotive and action which have engendered and produced history. Such a\r\nstyle would not be lively. Moreover, the excessive positivism with\r\nwhich each side maintains its facts, and the palpable sacrifice of\r\ntruth to party feeling, would make it impossible for any but an\r\neye-witness, who had lived through the scenes, and had preserved his\r\nimpartiality, to separate the wheat from the chaff. The Mormons declare\r\nthat if they knew their prophet to be an impostor, they could still\r\nlove, respect, and follow him in this life to the next. The Gentiles,\r\nI can see, would not accept him, even if he were proposed to them by a\r\nspirit from the other world. There is little inducement in this case to\r\nbreak the scriptural injunction, “Judge not.”\r\n\r\nUnder these considerations, I have added to the Appendix (No. V.) a\r\ndetailed chronological table of Mormon events: it is compiled from both\r\nparties, and has at least one merit--impartiality.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGY OF THE MOST IMPORTANT EVENTS RECORDED IN THE BOOK OF MORMON.\r\n\r\n[MORMON CHRONOLOGY.]\r\n\r\n(_By Elder James Marsden, and printed in the Compendium of Faith and\r\nDoctrines._)\r\n\r\n  B.C.\r\n\r\n  600. Lehi, Sariah, and their four sons, Laman, Lemuel, Sam, and\r\n  Nephi, left Jerusalem by the commandment of God, and journeyed into\r\n  the wilderness of Arabia (p. 17, 44, 97, pars. 3, 47, 4).\r\n\r\n  592. Lehi and his family arrived at the land Bountiful, so called\r\n  because of its much fruit. Its modern name is Arabia Felix, or Arabia\r\n  the Happy (p. 36, par. 17).\r\n\r\n  570. Jacob and Joseph were consecrated priests and teachers over the\r\n  people of Nephi (p. 66, par. 5).\r\n\r\n  560. Nephi was commanded to make a second volume of plates (p. 67,\r\n  par. 6).\r\n\r\n  545. Nephi commanded Jacob to write on the small plates such things\r\n  as he considered most precious (p. 114, par. 1).\r\n\r\n  421. Jacob having committed the records into the hands of his son\r\n  Enos, and Enos being old, he gave the records into the hands of his\r\n  son Jarom (p. 133, 136, pars. 9, 7).\r\n\r\n  400. The people of Nephi kept the law of Moses, and they rapidly\r\n  increased in numbers, and were greatly prospered (p. 137, par. 3).\r\n\r\n  362. Jarom being old, delivered the records into the hands of his son\r\n  Omni (p. 138, par. 6).\r\n\r\n  324. Omni was a wicked man, but he defended the Nephites from their\r\n  enemies (p. 138, par. 2).\r\n\r\n  280. Amaron delivered the plates to his brother Chemish (p. 139, par.\r\n  3).\r\n\r\n  124. After Abinadom, the son of Chemish, Amaleki,[214] the son\r\n  of Abinadom, King Benjamin, and Mosiah had successively kept the\r\n  records, Mosiah, the son of King Benjamin, was consecrated king (p.\r\n  157, par. 2).\r\n\r\n121. Mosiah sent sixteen men to the land of Lehi-Nephi to inquire\r\nconcerning their brethren (p. 158, par. 2).\r\n\r\n91. Mosiah died, having conferred the records upon Alma, who was the\r\nson of Alma. Mosiah also established a republican form of government,\r\nand appointed Alma the first and chief judge of the land (p. 205, 209,\r\npars. 1, 7).\r\n\r\n90. Nehor suffered an ignominious death for apostasy and for killing\r\nGideon (p. 210, pars. 3, 4).\r\n\r\n86. The usurper Amlici was slain by Alma. In this year many battles\r\nwere fought between the Nephites on the one hand, and the Amlicites,\r\nwho were Nephite revolutionists, and the Lamanites on the other. The\r\nNephites were mostly victorious (p. 215, 217, pars. 14, 18).\r\n\r\n85. Peace was restored and many were baptized in the waters of Sidon,\r\nand became members of the Church (p. 218, par. 1).\r\n\r\n84. Peace continued, and three thousand five hundred became members of\r\nthe Church of God (p. 218, par. 2).\r\n\r\n83. The members of the Church became proud because of their great\r\nriches (p. 218, par. 3).\r\n\r\n82. Alma delivered up the office of chief judge to Nephilah, and\r\nconfined himself wholly to the high priesthood, after the holy order of\r\nGod (p. 219, par. 5).\r\n\r\n81. Alma performed a mission to the land of Melek, and to the City\r\nAmmonihah (p. 230, pars. 2, 3).\r\n\r\n80. Alma and Amulek were delivered from prison by the mighty power of\r\nGod (p. 251, par. 11).\r\n\r\n79. The Lamanites destroyed the people of Ammonihah (p. 253, par. 2).\r\n\r\n76. There was peace during three years, and the Church was greatly\r\nprospered (p. 254, par. 8).\r\n\r\n75. Ammon performed a successful mission among the Lamanites (p. 288,\r\npar. 10).\r\n\r\n73. Korihor, the great anti-Christ, made his appearance (p. 290, par.\r\n2).\r\n\r\n72. Alma committed the record to the keeping of his son Helaman, and\r\ncommanded him to continue the history of his people (p. 310, par. 5).\r\n\r\n71. The Nephites obtained a complete victory over the Lamanites in the\r\nborders of Manti (p. 331, par. 16).\r\n\r\n71. Helaman performed a successful mission among the Nephites (p. 333,\r\npar. 4).\r\n\r\n69. Moroni commanded that the Nephites should fortify all their cities.\r\nThey also built many cities (p. 346, par. 1).\r\n\r\n68. This was the most comfortable, prosperous, and happy year that the\r\nNephites had ever seen (p. 348, par. 3).\r\n\r\n65. The people of Morianton prevented from escaping to the North or\r\nLake Country. Also Nephilah died, and his son Pahoran succeeded him as\r\nchief judge of the land (p. 348, pars. 5, 8).\r\n\r\n64. A contention between the advocates of monarchy on the one hand,\r\nand of republicanism on the other, was peaceably settled by the voice\r\nof the people. But 4000 of the monarchy men were slain for refusing to\r\ntake up arms in defense of their country against the Lamanites (p. 350,\r\npar. 3).\r\n\r\n63. Preparations for war between the Nephites and the Lamanites were\r\nmade (p. 354, par. 4).\r\n\r\n62. The same continued (p. 355, par. 4).\r\n\r\n61. Moroni retook the city of Melek, and obtained a complete victory\r\nover the Lamanites (p. 356, par. 12).\r\n\r\n60. Moroni, by stratagem, overcame the Lamanites, and liberated his\r\npeople from prison (p. 363, par. 7).\r\n\r\n59. Moroni received an epistle from Helaman, of the city of Judea, in\r\nwhich is set forth the wonderful victories obtained in that part of the\r\nland over the Lamanites (p. 364, par. 1).\r\n\r\n58. Moroni obtained possession of the city of Nephilah (p. 386, par.\r\n18).\r\n\r\n54. Peace having been restored, the Church became very prosperous, and\r\nHelaman died (p. 387, par. 3).\r\n\r\n53. Shiblon took possession of the sacred records, and Moroni died (p.\r\n387, pars. 1, 2).\r\n\r\n52. 5400 men, with their wives and children, left Zarahemla for the\r\nNorth country (p. 388, par. 3).\r\n\r\n50. Shiblon conferred the sacred records upon Helaman, the son of\r\nHelaman, and then died (p. 388, par. 5).\r\n\r\n49. Pahoran, the chief judge, having died, his son Pahoran was\r\nappointed to succeed him. This Pahoran was murdered by Kishkumen, and\r\nhis brother Pacumeni was appointed by his successor (p. 389, par. 3).\r\n\r\n48. Coriantumr led a numerous host against Zarahemla, took the city,\r\nand killed Pacumeni; but Moronihah retook the city, slew Coriantumr,\r\nand obtained a complete victory over the Lamanites (p. 390, par. 5).\r\n\r\n47. Helaman was appointed chief judge, and the band of Gadianton\r\nrobbers was organized (p. 392, par. 8).\r\n\r\n46. Peace reigned among the Nephites (p. 393, par. 1).\r\n\r\n45. Peace continued (p. 393, par. 1).\r\n\r\n44. Peace continued (p. 393, par. 1).\r\n\r\n43. Great contention among the Nephites; many of them traveled\r\nnorthward (p. 394, par. 2).\r\n\r\n36. Helaman died, and his son Nephi was appointed chief judge.\r\n\r\n31. The Nephites, because of their wickedness, lost many of their\r\ncities, and many of them were slain by the Lamanites (p. 397, par. 8).\r\n\r\n28. The Nephites repented at the preaching of Moronihah (p. 397, par.\r\n10).\r\n\r\n27. Moronihah could obtain no more possessions from the Lamanites.\r\nNephi vacated the office of chief judge in favor of Cezoram (p.\r\n398, 399, pars. 11, 13). The greater part of the Lamanites became a\r\nrighteous people (p. 403, par. 25).\r\n\r\n26. Nephi and Lehi went northward to preach unto the people (p. 404,\r\npar. 26).\r\n\r\n23. Cezoram was murdered by an unknown hand as he sat on the\r\njudgment-seat. His son, who was appointed to succeed him, was also\r\nmurdered (p. 404, par. 28).\r\n\r\n22. The Nephites became very wicked (p. 406, par. 31).\r\n\r\n21. The Lamanites observed the laws of righteousness, and utterly\r\ndestroyed the Gadianton robbers from among them (p. 406, par. 32).\r\n\r\n20. Men belonging to the Gadianton band usurped the judgment-seat (p.\r\n407, par. 1).\r\n\r\n18. Nephi prophesied many important things against his people (p. 416,\r\npar. 15).\r\n\r\n14. Three years’ famine brought the people to repentance, and caused\r\nthem to destroy the Gadianton robbers (p. 417, pars. 2,3).\r\n\r\n13. Peace being restored, the people spread themselves abroad, to\r\nrepair their waste places (p. 418, par. 4).\r\n\r\n12. The majority of the people, both Nephites and Lamanites, became\r\nmembers of the Church (p. 418, par. 4).\r\n\r\n9. Certain dissenters among the Nephites stirred up the Lamanites\r\nagainst their brethren, and they revived the secrets of Gadianton (p.\r\n419, par. 5).\r\n\r\n5. The Lamanites prevailed against the Nephites, because of their great\r\nwickedness (p. 420, par. 7).\r\n\r\n4. Samuel the Lamanite performed a mission among the Nephites (p. 422,\r\npar. 1).\r\n\r\n1. Great signs and wonders were given unto the people, and the words of\r\nthe Prophets began to be fulfilled (p. 431, par. 10).\r\n\r\nLachoneus was the chief judge and governor of the land. Nephi gave the\r\nrecords into the hands of his son Nephi (p. 432, par. 1).\r\n\r\nThe Lord revealed to Nephi that he would come into the world the next\r\nday, and many signs of his coming were given (p. 433, par. 3).\r\n\r\nA.C.\r\n\r\n3. The Gadianton robbers committed many depredations (p. 434, par. 6).\r\n\r\n4. The Gadianton robbers greatly increased (p. 434, par. 6).\r\n\r\n9. The Nephites began to reckon their time from the coming of Christ\r\n(p. 435, par. 8).\r\n\r\n13. The Nephites were joined by many of the Lamanites in defense\r\nagainst the robbers, who had now become very numerous and formidable\r\n(p. 436, par. 9).\r\n\r\n15. The Nephites were worsted in several engagements (p. 436, par. 10).\r\n\r\n16. Gidgidoni, who was a chief judge and a great prophet, was appointed\r\ncommander-in-chief (p. 438, par. 3).\r\n\r\n17. The Nephites gathered themselves together for the purpose of mutual\r\ndefense, and provided themselves with seven years’ provisions (p. 439,\r\npar. 4).\r\n\r\n19. A great battle was fought between the Nephites and the Gadianton\r\nrobbers, in which the latter were defeated, and their leader,\r\nGiddianhi, was slain (p. 440, pars. 6, 8).\r\n\r\n21. The Nephites slew tens of thousands of the robbers, and took all\r\nthat were alive prisoners, and hanged their leader, Zemnarihah (p. 441,\r\n442, pars. 9, 10).\r\n\r\n25. Mormon made new plates, upon which he made a record of what took\r\nplace from the time Lehi left Jerusalem until his own day, and also a\r\nhistory of his own times (p. 443, par. 11).\r\n\r\n26. The Nephites spread themselves abroad on their former possessions\r\n(p. 445, par. 1).\r\n\r\n30. Lachoneus, the son of Lachoneus, was appointed governor of the\r\nland. He was murdered, and the people became divided into numerous\r\ntribes (p. 446, 447, pars. 3, 4).\r\n\r\n31. Nephi having great faith in God, angels did minister to him daily\r\n(p. 449, par. 8).\r\n\r\n32. The few who were converted through the preaching of Nephi were\r\ngreatly blessed of God (p. 449, par. 10).\r\n\r\n33. Many were baptized into the Church (p. 449, par. 10).\r\n\r\n34. A terrible tempest took place, which changed and deformed the whole\r\nface of the land. Three days elapsed during which no light was seen.\r\n\r\nThe voice of Jesus Christ was heard by all the people of the land,\r\ndeclaring that he had caused this destruction, and commanding them to\r\ncease to offer burnt-offerings and sacrifices (p. 453, pars. 7, 8).\r\n\r\n35. In this year Jesus Christ appeared among the Nephites, and unfolded\r\nto them at large the principles of the Gospel (p. 455, pars. 11, 1).\r\nThe apostles of Christ formed a Church of Christ (p. 492, par. 1).\r\n\r\n36. Both the Nephites and the Lamanites were all converted, and had all\r\nthings in common (p. 492, par. 2).\r\n\r\n37. Many miracles were wrought by the disciples of Jesus (p. 492, par.\r\n3).\r\n\r\n59. The people rebuilt the city of Zarahemla, and were very prosperous\r\n(p. 493, par. 3).\r\n\r\n100. The disciples of Jesus, whom he had chosen, had all gone to\r\nParadise except the three who obtained the promise that they should not\r\ntaste of death (p. 493, par. 5).\r\n\r\n110. Nephi died, and his son Amos kept the record (p. 493, par. 6).\r\n\r\n194. Amos died, and his son Amos kept the record (p. 494, par. 7).\r\n\r\n201. The people ceased to have all things in common; they became proud,\r\nand were divided into classes (p. 494, par. 7).\r\n\r\n210. There were many churches who were opposed to the true Church of\r\nChrist (p. 494, par. 8).\r\n\r\n230. The people dwindled in unbelief and wickedness from year to year\r\n(p. 494, par. 8).\r\n\r\n231. A great division took place among the people (p. 495, par. 8).\r\n\r\n244. The wicked part of the people became stronger and more numerous\r\nthan the righteous (p. 495, par. 9).\r\n\r\n260. The people began to build up the secret oaths and combinations of\r\nGadianton (p. 495, par. 9).\r\n\r\n300. The Gadianton robbers spread themselves all over the face of the\r\nland (p. 496, par. 10).\r\n\r\n305. Amos died, and his brother Ammaron kept the record in his stead\r\n(p. 496, par. 11).\r\n\r\n320. Ammaron hid up all the sacred records unto the Lord, and gave\r\ncommandment unto Mormon concerning them (p. 496, pars. 11, 1).\r\n\r\n321. A war commenced between the Nephites and Lamanites, in which the\r\nformer were victorious (p. 497, par. 2).\r\n\r\n325. Mormon was restrained from preaching to the people, and because\r\nof their wickedness, and the prevalence of sorceries, witchcrafts, and\r\nmagic, their treasures slipped away from them (p. 497, par. 2).\r\n\r\n326. Mormon was appointed leader of the Nephite armies (p. 498, par. 3).\r\n\r\n330. A great battle took place in the land of Joshua, in which the\r\nNephites were victorious (p. 498, par. 3).\r\n\r\n344. Thousands of the Nephites were hewn down in their open rebellion\r\nagainst God (p. 499, par. 4).\r\n\r\n345. Mormon had obtained the plates according to commandment of\r\nAmmaron, and he made an account of the wickedness and abominations of\r\nhis people (p. 499, par. 5).\r\n\r\n346. The Nephites were driven northward to the land of Shem, and there\r\nfought and beat a powerful army of the Lamanites (p. 500, par. 6).\r\n\r\n349. The Nephites obtained by treaty all the land of their inheritance,\r\nand a ten years’ peace ensued (p. 500, par. 6).\r\n\r\n360. The king of the Lamanites sent an epistle to Mormon indicating\r\nthat they were again preparing for war (p. 501, par. 7).\r\n\r\n361. A battle took place near the City of Desolation. The Nephites were\r\nvictorious (p. 501, par. 8).\r\n\r\n362. A second battle ensued with the like result (p. 501, par. 8).\r\nMormon now gave up the command of the Nephite army (p. 501, par. 9).\r\n\r\n363. The Lamanites obtained a signal victory over the Nephites, and\r\ntook possession of the City of Desolation (p. 502, par. 1).\r\n\r\n364. The Nephites retook the City of Desolation (p. 503, par. 2).\r\n\r\n366. The Lamanites again took possession of the City of Desolation, and\r\nalso succeeded in taking the City of Teancum (p. 503, par. 3).\r\n\r\n367. The Nephites avenged the murder of their wives and children, and\r\ndrove the Lamanites out of their land; and ten years’ peace ensued (p.\r\n503, par. 3).\r\n\r\n375. The Lamanites came again to battle with the Nephites, and beat\r\nthem (p. 504, par. 3).\r\n\r\nThe Nephites from this time forth were prevailed against by the\r\nLamanites; Mormon therefore took all the records which Ammaron had hid\r\nup unto the Lord (p. 504, par. 3).\r\n\r\n379. Mormon resumed the command of the Nephite armies (p. 504, par. 4).\r\n\r\n380. Mormon wrote an abridged account of the events which he had seen\r\n(p. 505, par. 5).\r\n\r\n384. The Nephites encamped around the hill Cumorah. Mormon hid up in\r\nthe hill Cumorah all the plates that were committed to his trust,\r\nexcept a few which he gave to his son Moroni (p. 507, pars. 1, 2).\r\n\r\nThe battle of Cumorah was fought, in which two hundred and thirty\r\nthousand of the Nephites were slain (p. 507, pars. 2, 3).\r\n\r\n400. All the Nephites, as a distinct people, except Moroni, were\r\ndestroyed (p. 509, par. 1).\r\n\r\n421. Moroni finished and sealed up all the records, according to the\r\ncommandment of God (p. 561, par. 1).\r\n\r\n  [214] While Amaleki was keeping the records, Mosiah, the father of\r\n  King Benjamin, and as many as would hearken to the voice of God, were\r\n  commanded to go into the wilderness, and were led by the power of the\r\n  Almighty to the Land of Zarahemla, where they discovered a people who\r\n  left Jerusalem at the time that Zedekiah was carried away captive\r\n  into Babylon. They were led by Mulek, the only surviving son of\r\n  Zedekiah; and on their arrival in America, met with Coriantumr, the\r\n  late king of the Jaredites, who were slain a little previous to the\r\n  immigration of Mulek and his people (p. 139, 40, 411, 549, pars. 6,\r\n  9).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nFarther Observations at Great Salt Lake City.\r\n\r\n\r\n[THE COURT-HOUSE.--P. K. DOTSON.]\r\n\r\nOne of my last visits was to the court-house on an interesting\r\noccasion. The _Palais de Justice_ is near where the old fort once was,\r\nin the western part of the settlement. It is an unfinished building of\r\nadobe, based on red sandstone, with a flag-staff and a tinned roof,\r\nwhich gives it a somewhat Muscovite appearance, and it cost $20,000.\r\nThe courts and Legislature sit in a neat room, with curtains and\r\nchandeliers, and polished pine-wood furniture, all as yet unfaded.\r\nThe occasion which had gathered together the notabilities of the\r\nplace was this: Mr. Peter Dotson, the United States Marshal of the\r\nTerritory, living at Camp Floyd, and being on the opposition side,\r\nhad made himself--the Mormons say--an unscrupulous partisan. In July,\r\n1859, he came from the cantonment armed with a writ issued by Mr.\r\nDelana R. Eckels, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and accompanied\r\nby two officers of the United States Army, to the Holy City for the\r\npurpose of arresting a Mr. Mackenzie--now in the Penitentiary for\r\ncounterfeiting “quarter-masters’ drafts”--an engraver by profession,\r\nand then working in the Deserét store of Mr. Brigham Young. Forgery\r\nand false coining are associated in the Gentile mind with Mormonism,\r\nand inveterately so; whether truly or not, I can not say: it is highly\r\nprobable that Mr. Bogus’s[215] habitat is not limited by latitude,\r\naltitude, or longitude; at the same time, the Saints are too much _en\r\névidence_ to entertain him publicly. The marshal, probably not aware\r\nthat the Territory had passed no law enabling the myrmidons of justice\r\nto seize suspicious implements and apparatus made _main forte_, levied,\r\ndespite due notice, upon what he found appertaining to Mr. Mackenzie,\r\na Bible, a Book of Mormon, and--here was the rub--the copper plates of\r\nthe Deserét Currency Association. This plunder was deposited for the\r\nnight with the governor, and was carried in a sack on the next day\r\nto Camp Floyd. Then the anti-Mormons sang Io pæans; they had--to use\r\na Western phrase--“got the dead wood on Brigham;” letters traced back\r\nto officials appeared in the Eastern and other papers, announcing to\r\nthe public that the Prophet was a detected forger. Presently, the true\r\ncharacter of the copper plates appearing, they were generously offered\r\nback; but, as trespass had been committed, to say nothing of libel, and\r\nas all concerned in the affair were obnoxious men, it was resolved to\r\ntry law. A civil suit was instituted, and a sum of $1600 was claimed\r\nfor damage done to the plates by scratching, and for loss of service,\r\nwhich hindered business in the city. The unfortunate marshal, who was\r\nprobably a “cat’s-paw,” had “caught a Tartar;” he possessed a house and\r\nfurniture, a carriage and horses, all of which were attached, and the\r\ncase of “Brigham Young, sen., _vs._ P. K. Dotson,” ended in a verdict\r\nfor the plaintiff, viz., value of plates destroyed, $1668; damages,\r\n$648 66. The anti-Mormons declared him a martyr; the Mormons, a vicious\r\nfool; and sensible Gentiles asserted that he was rightly served for\r\nshowing evil animus. The case might have ended badly but for the\r\nprudence of the governor. Had a descent been made for the purpose of\r\narrest upon the Prophet’s house, the consequences would certainly have\r\nbeen serious to the last degree.\r\n\r\n  [215] Bogus, according to Mr. Bartlett, who quotes the “Boston\r\n  Courier” of June 12, 1857, is a Western corruption of Borghese,\r\n  “a very corrupt individual, who, twenty years ago or more, did a\r\n  tremendous business in the way of supplying the great West and\r\n  portions of the Southwest with counterfeit bills and drafts on\r\n  fictitious banks.” The word is now applied in the sense of sham,\r\n  forged, counterfeit, and so on; there are bogus laws and bogus\r\n  members; in fact, bogus enters every where.\r\n\r\nThe cause was tried in the Probate Court, which I have explained to be\r\na Territorial, not a federal court. The Honorable Elias Smith presided,\r\nand the arguments for the prosecution and the defense were conducted by\r\nthe ablest Mormon and anti-Mormon lawyers. I attended the house, and\r\ncarefully watched the proceedings, to detect, if possible, intimidation\r\nor misdirection; every thing was done with even-handed justice. The\r\nphysical aspect of the court was that which foreign travelers in the\r\nFar West delight to describe and ridicule, wholly forgetting that they\r\nhave seen the same scene much nearer home. His honor sat with his chair\r\ntilted back and his boots on the table, exactly as if he had been an\r\nAnglo-Indian collector and magistrate, while by a certain contraction\r\nand expansion of the dexter corner of his well-closed mouth I suspected\r\nthe existence of the quid. The position is queer, but not more so than\r\nthat of a judge at Westminster sleeping soundly, in the attitude of\r\nPisa’s leaning monster, upon the bench. By the justice’s side sat the\r\nportly figure of Dr. Kay, opposite him the reporters, at other tables\r\nthe attorneys; the witnesses stood up between the tables, the jury were\r\non the left, and the public, including the governor, was distributed\r\nlike wall-flowers on benches around the room.\r\n\r\nThere is a certain monotony of life in Great Salt Lake City which does\r\nnot render the subject favorable for description. Moreover, a Moslem\r\ngloom, the result of austere morals and manners, of the semi-seclusion\r\nof the sex, and, in my case, of a reserve arising toward a stranger who\r\nappeared in the train of federal officials, hangs over society. There\r\nis none of that class which, according to the French author, _repose\r\ndes femmes du monde_. We rose early--in America the climate seems to\r\nmilitate against slugabedism--and breakfasted at any hour between 6\r\nand 9 A.M. Ensued “business,” which seemed to consist principally of\r\ncorrecting one’s teeth, and walking about the town, with occasional\r\n“liquoring up.” Dinner was at 1 P.M., announced, not by the normal\r\ngong of the Eastern States, which lately so direfully offended a pair\r\nof Anglo-Hibernian ears, but by a hand-bell which sounded the _pas\r\nde charge_. Jostling into the long room of the ordinary, we took our\r\nseats, and, seizing our forks, proceeded at once to action, after the\r\nfashion of Puddingburn House, where\r\n\r\n    “They who came not the first call,\r\n      Got no meat till the next meal.”\r\n\r\nNothing but water was drunk at dinner, except when a gentleman\r\npreferred to wash down roast pork with a tumbler of milk; wine in this\r\npart of the world is of course dear and bad, and even should the Saints\r\nmake their own, it can scarcely be cheap on account of the price of\r\nlabor. Feeding ended with a glass of liquor, not at the bar, because\r\nthere was none, but in the privacy of one’s chamber, which takes from\r\ndrinking half its charm. Most well-to-do men found time for a siesta in\r\nthe early afternoon. There was supper, which in modern English parlance\r\nwould be called dinner, at 6 P.M., and the evening was easily spent\r\nwith a friend.\r\n\r\n[HISTORIAN AND RECORDER’S OFFICE.]\r\n\r\nOne of my favorite places of visiting was the Historian and Recorder’s\r\nOffice, opposite Mr. Brigham Young’s block. It contained a small\r\ncollection of volumes, together with papers, official and private,\r\nplans, designs, and other requisites, many of them written in the\r\nDeserét alphabet, of which I subjoin a copy.[216] It is, as will\r\nreadily be seen, a stereographic modification of Pitman’s and other\r\nsystems. Types have been cast for it, and articles are printed in the\r\nnewspapers at times; as man, however, prefers two alphabets to one,\r\nit will probably share the fate of the “Fonetik Nuz.” Sir A. Alison\r\nsomewhere delivers it as his opinion that the future historian of\r\nAmerica will be forced to Europe, where alone his material can be\r\nfound; so far from this being the case, the reverse is emphatically\r\ntrue: every where in the States, even in the newest, the Historical\r\nSociety is an institution, and men pride themselves upon laboring for\r\nit. At the office I used to meet Mr. George A. Smith, the armor-bearer\r\nto the Prophet in the camp of Zion, who boasts of having sown the first\r\nseed, built the first saw-mill, and ground the first flour in Southern\r\nUtah, whence the nearest settlements, separated by terrible deserts,\r\nwere distant 200 miles. His companions were Messrs. W. Woodruff, Bishop\r\nBentley, who was preparing for a missionary visit to England, and\r\nWm. Thomas Bullock, an intelligent Mormon, who has had the honor to\r\nbe soundly abused in Mrs. Ferris’s 11th letter. The lady’s “wicked\r\nWelshman”--I suppose she remembered the well-known line anent the sons\r\nof the Cymri--\r\n\r\n    “Taffy is a Welshman, Taffy is a thief”--\r\n\r\nis no Cambrian, but an aborigine of Leek, Staffordshire, England,\r\nand was from 1838 to 1843 an excise officer in her majesty’s Inland\r\nRevenue; he kindly supplied me with a plan of the city, and other\r\ninformation, for which he has my grateful thanks.\r\n\r\n  [216] See next page.\r\n\r\n  +-------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                       THE DESERÉT ALPHABET.                       |\r\n  +---------------------+-------++------------------------------------+\r\n  |   =VOCAL SOUNDS.=   | 𐐘 Ga  ||The sounds of the letters 𐐆, 𐐇, 𐐈,  |\r\n  +---------+-----------+       ||𐐉, 𐐊, 𐐋 are heard in the words fit, |\r\n  |=Long.=  | =Double.= | 𐐙 F   ||net, fat, cot, nut, foot.           |\r\n  |         |           |       ||                                    |\r\n  | 𐐀 E     | 𐐌 I       | 𐐚 V   ||𐐕, 𐐘, 𐐛, 𐐜, 𐐟 are heard in the words|\r\n  |         |           |       ||_chee_-se, _ga_-te, s-_eth_, _the_, |\r\n  | 𐐁 A     | 𐐍 Ow      | 𐐛 Eth ||fl-_esh_.                           |\r\n  |         |           |       ||                                    |\r\n  | 𐐂 Ah    | 𐐎 Woo     | 𐐜 The ||𐐡 is like _ir_ in st-_ir_; _are_ is |\r\n  |         |           |       ||made by the combination of 𐐈 𐐡; 𐐥 is|\r\n  | 𐐃 Aw    | 𐐏 Ye      | 𐐝 S   ||heard in l-_eng_-th.                |\r\n  |         |           |       ||                                    |\r\n  | 𐐄 O     |=Aspirate.=| 𐐞 Z   ||=Learn this Alphabet and appreciate |\r\n  |         | 𐐐 H       |       ||       its advantages.=             |\r\n  | 𐐅 Oo    +===========+ 𐐟 Esh ||                                    |\r\n  |         |=Articulate|       ||                                    |\r\n  |         |  Sounds.= | 𐐠 Zhe ||                                    |\r\n  |=Short.= | 𐐑 P       |       ||                                    |\r\n  |𐐆}       |           | 𐐡 Ur  ||                                    |\r\n  | }(This  | 𐐒 B       |       ||                                    |\r\n  |𐐇}column |           | 𐐢 L   ||                                    |\r\n  | }  of   | 𐐓 T       |       ||                                    |\r\n  |𐐈}letters|           | 𐐣 M   ||                                    |\r\n  | }are the| 𐐔 D       |       ||                                    |\r\n  |𐐉} short |           | 𐐤 N   ||                                    |\r\n  | }sounds | 𐐕 Che     |       ||                                    |\r\n  |𐐊}of the |           | 𐐥 Eng ||                                    |\r\n  | }above).| 𐐖 G       |       ||                                    |\r\n  |𐐋}       |           |       ||                                    |\r\n  |         | 𐐗 K       |       ||                                    |\r\n  +---------+-----------+-------++------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n[FEDERAL OFFICIALS.]\r\n\r\nAt the office, the undying hatred of all things Gentile-federal had\r\nreached its climax; every slight offered to the faith by anti-Mormons\r\nis there laid up in lavender, every grievance is carefully recorded.\r\nThere I heard how, at a general conference of the Church of Jesus\r\nChrist of Latter-Day Saints, in September, 1851, Perry E. Brocchus, a\r\njudge of the Supreme Court, having the design of becoming Territorial\r\ndelegate to Congress, ascended the rostrum and foully abused their most\r\ncherished institution, polygamy.[217] He was answered with sternness\r\nby Mr. Brigham Young, and really, under the circumstances, the Saints\r\nbehaved very well in not proceeding to _voies de faits_. Mr. Brocchus,\r\nseeing personal danger, left the city in company with Chief Justice\r\nL. C. Brandenburg and Mr. Secretary Harris, whom the Mormons very\r\nnaturally accused of carrying away $24,000, the sum appropriated by\r\nCongress for the salary and the mileage of the local Legislature,\r\nthus putting a clog upon the wheels of government. I also heard how\r\nJudge Drummond, in 1856, began the troubles by falsely reporting to\r\nthe federal authority that the Mormons were in a state of revolt;\r\nthat they had burned the public library, and were, in fact, defying\r\nthe Union--how, bigotry doing its work, the officials at Washington\r\nbelieved the tale without investigation, and sent an army which was\r\nready to renew the scenes of St. Bartholomew and Nauvoo. The federal\r\ntroops were rather pitied than hated; had they been militia they\r\nwould have been wiped out; but “wretched Dutchmen, and poor devils\r\nof Irishmen,” acting under orders, were simply despised. Their\r\n_fainéantise_ was contrasted most unfavorably with the fiery Mormon\r\nyouth that was spoiling for a fight; that could ride, like part of\r\nthe horse, down places where no trooper dared venture; that picked\r\nup a dollar at full gallop, drove off the invaders’ cattle, burned\r\nwagons, grass, and provisions, offered to lasso the guns, and, when\r\nthey had taken a prisoner, drank with him and let him go--how Governor\r\nCumming, after his entry, at once certified the untruthfulness of\r\nthe scandal spread by Judge Drummond, especially that touching the\r\nlibrary and archives, and reported that no federal officer had ever\r\nbeen killed or even assaulted by the Saints--how the effects of these\r\nmisrepresentations have been and still are serious. In 1857, for\r\ninstance, the mail was cut off, and a large commercial community was\r\nleft without postal communication for a whole year: the ostensible\r\nreason was the troubled state of the Territory; the real cause was the\r\ndesire of the Post-office Department to keep the advance of the troops\r\ndark. The Mormons complain that they have ever been made a subject\r\nof political capital. President Van Buren openly confessed to them,\r\n“Gentlemen, your cause is just, but I can do nothing for you; if I\r\ntook your part I should lose the vote of Missouri.” Every grievance\r\nagainst them, they say, is listened to and readily believed: as an\r\nexample, a Mr. John Robinson, of Liverpool, had lately represented to\r\nher Britannic majesty’s Secretary for Foreign Affairs that his mother\r\nand sister were detained in Utah Territory against their will; the\r\nusual steps were taken; the British minister applied to the United\r\nStates Secretary of State, who referred the affair to the governor of\r\nthe Territory; after which process the tale turned out a mere _canard_.\r\nThis sister had been married to Mr. Ferguson, adjutant general of the\r\nNauvoo Legion; the mother had left the City of the Saints for Illinois,\r\nand had just written to her son-in-law for means by which she could\r\nreturn to a place whence she was to be rescued by British interference.\r\nTo a false prejudice against themselves the Mormons attribute the\r\nneglect with which their project of colonizing Vancouver’s Island\r\nwas treated by the British government, and the active opposition to\r\nbe expected should they ever attempt to settle in the Valley of the\r\nSaskatchewan. And they think it poor policy on the part of England to\r\n“bluff off” 100,000 moral, industrious, and obedient subjects, who\r\nwould be a bulwark against aggression on the part of the States, and\r\ntend materially to prepare the thousand miles of valley between the\r\nMississippi and the Pacific for the coming railway.\r\n\r\n  [217] On the 5th of April, 1860, the Chamber of Representatives at\r\n  Washington passed a projected law to repress polygamy by a majority\r\n  of 149 to 60. Fortunately, the Committee of the Senate had no time\r\n  to report upon it, and the slave discussion assumed dimensions which\r\n  buried Mormonism in complete oblivion.\r\n\r\n[CHILDREN OF THE SAINTS.]\r\n\r\nAt the office I also obtained details concerning education in Great\r\nSalt Lake City. Before commencing the subject it will be necessary\r\nto notice certain statements relating to the ingenuous youth of Utah\r\nTerritory. It is generally asserted that juvenile mortality here ranks\r\nsecond only to Louisiana, and the fault is, of course, charged upon\r\npolygamy. A French author talks of the _mortalité effrayante_ among\r\nthe newly-born, while owning, anomalously, that the survivors _sont\r\nbraves et robustes_. I “doubt the fact.” Mr. Ferris, moreover, declares\r\nthat there is “nowhere out of the Five Points of New York City a more\r\nfilthy, miserable, and disorderly rabble of children than can be found\r\nin the streets of Great Salt Lake City.” As far as my experience goes,\r\nit is the reverse. I was surprised by their numbers, cleanliness, and\r\nhealth, their hardihood and general good looks. They are bold and\r\nspirited. The Mormon father, like the Indian brave, will not allow\r\nthe barbarous use of the stick; but this is perhaps a general feeling\r\nthroughout the States, where the English traveler first observes the\r\ndocility of the horses and the indocility of the children. But, as\r\nregards rudeness, let a man “with whiskers under his snout,” _i. e._,\r\nmustaches, ride through a village in Essex or Warwickshire, and he\r\nwill suffer more contumely at the hands of the infant population in\r\nhalf an hour than in half a year in the United States or in Utah. M.\r\nRemy, despite a “_vif désir_” to judge favorably of the Saints, could\r\nnot help owning that the children are mostly _grossiers_, _menteurs_,\r\n_libertins avant l’âge_; that they use _un langage honteux, comme\r\nsi les mystères de la polygamie leur avaient été révélés dès l’âge\r\nde raison_. Apparently since 1855 _cette corruption précoce_ has\r\ndisappeared. I found less premature depravity than in the children of\r\nEuropean cities generally. Mr. J. Hyde also brings against the juvenile\r\nSaints severe charges, too general, however, not to be applicable to\r\nother lands. “Cheating the confiding is called smart trading;” the\r\nsame has been said of New England. “Mischievous cruelty, evidences of\r\nspirit;” the attribute of Plato’s boys and of the Western frontiers\r\ngenerally. “Pompous bravado, manly talk;” not unusual in New York,\r\nLondon, and Paris. “Reckless riding, fearless courage;” so apparently\r\nthinks the author of “Guy Livingstone.” “And if they outtalk their\r\nfathers, outwit their companions, whip their schoolteacher, outcurse a\r\nGentile, they are thought to be promising greatness, and are praised\r\naccordingly. Every visitor to Salt Lake will recognize the portrait,\r\nfor every visitor proclaims them to be the most whisky-loving,\r\ntobacco-chewing, saucy, and precocious children he ever saw.” This is\r\nthe glance of the anti-Mormon eye pure and simple. Tobacco and whisky\r\nare too dear for childhood at the City of the Saints; moreover, twenty\r\nyears ago, before Tom Brown taught boys not to be ashamed of being\r\ncalled good, a youth at many an English public school would have been\r\n“cock of the walk” if gifted with the rare merits described above. I\r\nremarked that the juveniles had all the promptness of reply and the\r\nperemptoriness of information which characterizes the Scotch and the\r\npeople of the Eastern States. A half-educated man can not afford to own\r\nignorance. He must answer categorically every question, however beyond\r\nhis reach; and the result is fatal to the diaries of those travelers\r\nwho can not diagnostize the disease.\r\n\r\n[MORMON EDUCATION.]\r\n\r\nMormon education is of course peculiar. The climate predisposes to\r\nindolence. While the emigrants from the Old Country are the most\r\nenergetic and hard-working of men, their children, like the race of\r\nbackwoodsmen in mass, are averse to any but pleasurable physical\r\nexertion. The object of the young colony is to rear a swarm of\r\nhealthy working bees. The social hive has as yet no room for drones,\r\nbook-worms, and gentlemen. The work is proportioned to their powers and\r\ninclinations. At fifteen a boy can use a whip, an axe, or a hoe--he\r\ndoes not like the plow--to perfection. He sits a bare-backed horse\r\nlike a Centaur, handles his bowie-knife skillfully, never misses a\r\nmark with his revolver, and can probably dispose of half a bottle of\r\nwhisky. It is not an education which I would commend to the generous\r\nyouth of Paris and London, but it is admirably fitted to the exigencies\r\nof the situation. With regard to book-work, there is no difficulty to\r\nobtain in Great Salt Lake City that “mediocrity of knowledge between\r\nlearning and ignorance” which distinguished the grammar-schools of the\r\nWestern Islands in the days of Samuel Johnson. Amid such a concourse\r\nof European converts, any language, from Hebrew to Portuguese, can be\r\nlearned. Mathematics and the exact sciences have their votaries. There\r\nare graduates of Harvard, Dartmouth, and other colleges. I saw one\r\ngentleman who had kept a school in Portsmouth, and another, who had had\r\na large academy in Shropshire, taught in the school of the 14th ward.\r\nMusic, dancing, drawing, and other artlets, which go by the name of\r\naccomplishments, have many votaries. Indefatigable travelers there are\r\nin abundance. Almost every Mormon is a missionary, and every missionary\r\nis a voyager. Captain Gibson, a well-known name for “personal\r\ninitiative” in the Eastern Main, where he was seized by the Dutch of\r\nJava, lately became a convert to Mormonism, married his daughter to\r\nMr. Brigham Young, and in sundry lectures delivered in the Tabernacle,\r\nadvised the establishment of a stake of Zion in the “Islands of the\r\nSeas,” which signified, I suppose, his intention that the Netherlands\r\nshould “smell H--ll.” Law is commonly studied, and the practice, as I\r\nhave shown, is much simplified by the absence of justice. A solicitor\r\nfrom London is also established here. Theology is the growth of the\r\nsoil. Medicine is represented by two graduates--one of Maryland; the\r\nother, who prefers politics to practice, of New York. I am at pains\r\nto discover what gave rise to the Gentile reports that the Mormons,\r\nhaving a veritable horror of medicine, leave curing to the priests, and\r\ndare not arrogate the art of healing. Masterships and apprenticeships\r\nare carefully regulated by Territorial law. Every one learns to read\r\nand write; probably the only destitutes are the old European pariahs,\r\nand the gleanings from the five or six millions of English illiterati.\r\nThe Mormons have discovered, or, rather, have been taught, by their\r\nnecessities as a working population in a state barely twelve years old,\r\nthat the time of school drudgery may profitably be abridged. A boy,\r\nthey say, will learn all that his memory can carry during three hours\r\nof book-work, and the rest had far better be spent in air, exercise,\r\nand handicraft. To their eminently practical views I would offer one\r\nsuggestion, the advisability of making military drill and extension\r\nmovements, with and without weapons, a part of scholarhood. For\r\n“setting up” the figure, forming the gait, and exercising the muscles,\r\nit is the best of gymnastic systems, and the early habit of acting in\r\nconcert with others is a long stride in the path of soldiership.\r\n\r\nWhile it is the fashion with some to deride the attempts of this\r\npainstaking and industrious community of hard-handed men to improve\r\ntheir minds, other anti-Mormons have taken the popular ground of\r\nrepresenting the Saints as averse to intellectual activity, despisers\r\nof science, respecters only of manual labor, and “_singulièrement\r\népris de la force brutale_.” It is as ungenerous as to ridicule the\r\nproceedings of an English Mechanics’ Institute, or the compositions of\r\nan “Ed. Mechanics’ Magazine.” The names of their literary institutions\r\nare, it is true, somewhat pretentious and grandiloquent; but in these\r\nlands there is every where a leaning toward the grandiose. Humility\r\ndoes not pay. Modesty _laudatur et alget_.\r\n\r\nAs early as December, 1854, an act was approved enabling the Chancellor\r\nand Board of Regents of the University of the State of Deserét to\r\nappoint a superintendent of common schools for the Territory of Utah,\r\nand duly qualified trustees were elected to assess and collect for\r\neducational purposes a tax upon all taxable property. In the same\r\nyear a pathetic memorial was dispatched to Congress, requesting\r\nthat honorable body to appropriate the sum of $5000 to advance the\r\ninterests of the University established by law in the City of Great\r\nSalt Lake. I know not whether it was granted. As yet there is no\r\neducational tax leviable throughout the Territory. Each district makes\r\nits own regulations. A city rate supports a school in each ward. The\r\nbuildings are of plain adobe, thirty feet by twenty. They also serve as\r\nmeeting-places on Sabbath evenings. There are tutoresses in three or\r\nfour of the school-houses, who teach all the year round, whereas male\r\neducation is usually limited by necessity to the three winter months.\r\nA certain difficulty exists in finding instructors. As in Australia,\r\nthe pedagogue is cheaper than a porter, and “turning schoolmaster” is a\r\nproverbial phrase about equivalent to coming upon the parish.\r\n\r\nThe principal educational institutions in Great Salt Lake City have\r\nbeen the following:\r\n\r\n1. The Deserét Universal Scientific.\r\n\r\n2. The “Polysophical Society,” a name given by Judge Phelps.\r\n\r\n3. The Seventies’ Variety Club.\r\n\r\n4. The Council of Health, a medico-physiologio-clinical and matronly\r\nestablishment, like the Dorcas Societies of the Eastern States.\r\n\r\n5. The Deserét Theological Institution, whose President was Mr. Brigham\r\nYoung.\r\n\r\n6. The Deserét Library and Musical Society.\r\n\r\n7. The Phrenological and Horticultural Society.\r\n\r\n8. The Deserét Agricultural and Manufacturing Society, which has\r\nalready been alluded to. It has many branch societies, whose members\r\npay an annual subscription of $1.\r\n\r\n9. The Academy founded in April, 1860, with an appropriation by the\r\nlocal Legislature of Church money to the extent of $2500. Science\r\nand art are to be taught gratis to all who will pledge themselves to\r\nlearn thoroughly and to benefit the Territory by their exertions. The\r\nsuperintendent is Mr. Orson Pratt; and his son, Mr. O. Pratt, junior,\r\ntogether with Mr. Cobb, a Gentile, acts as teacher. At present those\r\neducated are males; in course of time a girl class will be established\r\nfor accomplishments and practical education.\r\n\r\nThe Historian’s Office was ever to me a place of pleasant resort;\r\nI take my leave of it with many expressions of gratitude for the\r\ninstructive hours passed there.\r\n\r\nIt will, I suppose, be necessary to supply a popular view of\r\nthe “peculiar institution,” at once the bane and blessing of\r\nMormonism--plurality. I approach the subject with a feeling of despair,\r\nso conflicting are opinions concerning it, and so difficult is it to\r\nnaturalize in Europe the customs of Asia, Africa, and America, or to\r\nreconcile the habits of the 19th century A.D. with those of 1900 B.C. A\r\nreturn to the patriarchal ages, we have seen, has its disadvantages.\r\n\r\nThere is a prevailing idea, especially in England, and even the\r\neducated are laboring under it, that the Mormons are Communists or\r\nSocialists of Plato’s, Cicero’s, Mr. Owen’s, and M. Cabet’s school;\r\nthat wives are in public, and that a woman can have as many husbands\r\nas the husband can have wives--in fact, to speak colloquially, that\r\nthey “all pig together.” The contrary is notably the case. The man\r\nwho, like Messrs. Hamilton and Howard Egan, murders, in cold blood,\r\nhis wife’s lover, is invariably acquitted, the jury declaring that\r\ncivil damages mark the rottenness of other governments, and that “the\r\nprinciple, the only one that beats and throbs through the heart of the\r\n_entire inhabitants_ (!) of this Territory, is simply this: _The man\r\nwho seduces his neighbor’s wife must die, and her nearest relation\r\nmust kill him_.” Men, like Dr. Vaughan and Mr. Monroe, slain for the\r\nmortal sin, perish for their salvation; the Prophet, were they to lay\r\ntheir lives at his feet, would, because unable to hang or behead them,\r\ncounsel them to seek certain death in a righteous cause as an expiatory\r\nsacrifice,[218] which may save their souls alive. Their two mortal sins\r\nare: 1. Adultery; 2. Shedding innocent blood.\r\n\r\n  [218] The form of death has yet to be decided. They call this a\r\n  scriptural practice, viz., “to deliver such a one unto Satan for the\r\n  destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of\r\n  the Lord Jesus Christ” (1 Cor., v., 5).\r\n\r\nThis severity of punishing an offense which modern and civilized\r\nsociety looks upon rather in the light of a sin than of a crime, is\r\nclearly based upon the Mosaic code. It is also, _lex loci_, the “common\r\nmountain law,” a “religious and social custom,” and a point of personal\r\nhonor. Another idea underlies it: the Mormons hold, like the Hebrews of\r\nold, “children of shame” in extreme dishonor. They quote the command of\r\nGod, Deuteronomy (xxiii., 2), “a mamzer shall not enter into the Church\r\nof the Lord till the tenth generation,” and ask when the order was\r\nrepealed. They would expel all impurity from the Camp of Zion, and they\r\nadopt every method of preventing what they consider a tremendous evil,\r\nviz., the violation of God’s temple in their own bodies.\r\n\r\nThe marriage ceremony is performed in the temple, or, that being\r\nimpossible, in Mr. Brigham Young’s office, properly speaking by the\r\nProphet, who can, however, depute any follower, as Mr. Heber C.\r\nKimball, a simple apostle, or even an elder, to act for him. When\r\nmutual consent is given, the parties are pronounced man and wife in the\r\nname of Jesus Christ, prayers follow, and there is a patriarchal feast\r\nof joy in the evening.\r\n\r\n[_THE_ WIFE.]\r\n\r\nThe first wife, as among polygamists generally, is _the_ wife, and\r\nassumes the husband’s name and title. Her “plurality”-partners are\r\ncalled sisters--such as Sister Anne or Sister Blanche--and are the\r\naunts of her children. The first wife is married for time, the others\r\nare sealed for eternity. Hence, according to the Mormons, arose the\r\nGentile calumny concerning spiritual wifedom, which they distinctly\r\ndeny. Girls rarely remain single past sixteen--in England the average\r\nmarrying age is thirty--and they would be the pity of the community if\r\nthey were doomed to a waste of youth so unnatural.\r\n\r\n[DIVORCE.]\r\n\r\nDivorce is rarely obtained by the man who is ashamed to own that he can\r\nnot keep his house in order; some, such as the President, would grant\r\nit only in case of adultery: wives, however, are allowed to claim it\r\nfor cruelty, desertion, or neglect. Of late years, Mormon women married\r\nto Gentiles are cut off from the society of the Saints, and, without\r\nuncharitableness, men suspect a sound previous reason. The widows of\r\nthe Prophet are married to his successor, as David took unto himself\r\nthe wives of Saul; being generally aged, they occupy the position of\r\nmatron rather than wife, and the same is the case when a man espouses a\r\nmother and her daughter.\r\n\r\n[THE VIRGIN’S END.]\r\n\r\nIt is needless to remark how important a part matrimony plays in the\r\nhistory of an individual, and of that aggregate of individuals, a\r\npeople; or how various and conflicting has been Christian practice\r\nconcerning it, from the double marriage, civil and religious, the\r\nformer temporary, the latter permanent, of the Coptic or Abyssinian\r\nChurch, to the exaggerated purity of Mistress Anna Lee, the mother of\r\nthe Shakers, who exacted complete continence in a state established\r\naccording to the first commandment, _crescite et multiplicamini_.\r\nThe literalism with which the Mormons have interpreted Scripture\r\nhas led them directly to polygamy. The texts promising to Abraham\r\na progeny numerous as the stars above or the sands below, and that\r\n“in his seed (a polygamist) all the families of the earth shall be\r\nblessed,” induce them, his descendants, to seek a similar blessing.\r\nThe theory announcing that “the man is not without the woman, nor\r\nthe woman without the man,” is by them interpreted into an absolute\r\ncommand that both sexes should marry, and that a woman can not enter\r\nthe heavenly kingdom without a husband to introduce her. A virgin’s\r\nend is annihilation or absorption, _nox est perpetua una dormienda_;\r\nand as baptism for the dead--an old rite, revived and founded upon\r\nthe writings of St. Paul quoted in the last chapter--has been made\r\na part of practice, vicarious marriage for the departed also enters\r\ninto the Mormon scheme. Like certain British Dissenters of the royal\r\nburgh of Dundee, who in our day petitioned Parliament for permission\r\nto bigamize, the Mormons, with Bossuet and others, see in the New\r\nTestament no order against plurality,[219] and in the Old dispensation\r\nthey find the practice sanctioned in a family, ever the friends of God,\r\nand out of which the Redeemer sprang. Finally, they find throughout the\r\nnations of the earth three polygamists in theory to one monogame.\r\n\r\n  [219] Histoire des Variations, liv. iv. “L’Evangile n’a ni révoqué\r\n  ni défendu ce qui avait été permis dans la loi de Moïse à l’égard du\r\n  mariage: Jesus Christ n’a pas changé la police extérieure, mais il\r\n  a ajouté seulement la justice et la vie éternelle pour récompense.”\r\n  So, in 1539, the Landgrave Philip of Hesse, wishing to marry a second\r\n  wife while the first was alive, was permitted to “commit bigamy” by\r\n  the eminent reformers, M. Luther, Kuhorn (M. Bucer), Melancthon,\r\n  and others, with the sole condition of secrecy. In the present age,\r\n  the Right Rev. J. W. Colenso, D.D. and Bishop of Natal, “not only\r\n  tolerates polygamy in converts, but defends it on the ground of\r\n  religion and humanity.”\r\n\r\n[POLYGAMY.]\r\n\r\nThe “chaste and plural marriage,” being once legalized, finds a\r\nmultitude of supporters. The anti-Mormons declare that it is at once\r\nfornication and adultery--a sin which absorbs all others. The Mormons\r\npoint triumphantly to the austere morals of their community, their\r\nsuperior freedom from maladive influences, and the absence of that\r\nuncleanness and licentiousness which distinguish the cities of the\r\ncivilized world. They boast that, if it be an evil, they have at\r\nleast chosen the lesser evil; that they practice openly as a virtue\r\nwhat others do secretly as a sin--how full is society of these\r\nlatent Mormons!--that their plurality has abolished the necessity of\r\nconcubinage, cryptogamy, contubernium, celibacy, _mariages du treizième\r\narrondissement_, with their terrible consequences, infanticide, and\r\nso forth; that they have removed their ways from those “whose end is\r\nbitter as wormwood, and sharp as a two-edged sword.” Like its sister\r\ninstitution Slavery, the birth and growth of a similar age, Polygamy\r\nacquires _vim_ by abuse and detraction: the more turpitude is heaped\r\nupon it, the brighter and more glorious it appears to its votaries.\r\n\r\nThere are rules and regulations of Mormonism--I can not say whether\r\nthey date before or after the heavenly command to pluralize--which\r\ndisprove the popular statement that such marriages are made to gratify\r\nlicentiousness, and which render polygamy a positive necessity. All\r\nsensuality in the married state is strictly forbidden beyond the\r\nrequisite for insuring progeny--the practice, in fact, of Adam and\r\nAbraham. During the gestation and nursing of children, the strictest\r\ncontinence on the part of the mother is required--rather for a hygienic\r\nthan for a religious reason. The same custom is practiced in part by\r\nthe Jews, and in whole by some of the noblest tribes of savages; the\r\nsplendid physical development of the Kaffir race in South Africa is\r\nattributed by some authors to a rule of continence like that of the\r\nMormons, and to a lactation prolonged for two years. The anomaly of\r\nsuch a practice in the midst of civilization is worthy of a place in De\r\nBalzac’s great repertory of morbid anatomy: it is only to be equaled by\r\nthe exceptional nature of the Mormon’s position, his past fate and his\r\nfuture prospects. Spartan-like, the Faith wants a race of warriors, and\r\nit adopts the best means to obtain them.\r\n\r\nBesides religious and physiological, there are social motives for the\r\nplurality. As in the days of Abraham, the lands about New Jordan are\r\nbroad and the people few. Of the three forms that unite the sexes,\r\npolygamy increases, while monogamy balances, and polyandry diminishes\r\nprogeny. The former, as Montesquieu acutely suggested, acts inversely\r\nto the latter by causing a preponderance of female over male births:\r\n“Un fait important à noter,” says M. Remy, “c’est qu’il y a en Utah\r\nbeaucoup plus de naissances de filles que de garçons, resultat opposé\r\nà ce qu’on observe dans tous les pays où la monogamie est pratiquée,\r\net parfaitement conforme à ce qu’on a remarqué chez les polygames\r\nMussulmans.” M. Remy’s statement is as distinctly affirmed by Mr. Hyde,\r\nthe Mormon apostate. In the East, where the census is unknown, we can\r\njudge of the relative proportions of the sexes only by the families\r\nof the great and wealthy, who invariably practice polygamy, and we\r\nfind the number of daughters mostly superior to that of sons, except\r\nwhere female infanticide deludes the public into judging otherwise.\r\nIn lands where polyandry is the rule, for instance, in the Junsar and\r\nBawur pergunnahs of the Dhun, there is a striking discrepancy in the\r\nproportions of the sexes among young children as well as adults: thus,\r\nin a village where 400 boys are found, there will be 120 girls; and,\r\non the other hand, in the Gurhwal Hills, where polygamy is prevalent,\r\nthere is a surplus of female children. The experienced East Indian\r\nofficial who has published this statement[220] is “inclined to give\r\nmore weight to nature’s adaptability to national habit than to the\r\npossibility of infanticide,” for which there are no reasons. If these\r\nbe facts, Nature then has made provision for polygamy and polyandry:\r\nour plastic mother has prepared her children to practice them all. Even\r\nin Scotland modern statists have observed that the proportion of boys\r\nborn to girls is greater in the rural districts; and, attributing the\r\nphenomenon to the physical weakening of the parents, have considered it\r\na rule so established as to “afford a valuable hint to those who desire\r\nmale progeny.” The anti-Mormons are fond of quoting Paley: “It is not\r\nthe question whether one man will have more children by five wives, but\r\nwhether these five women would not have had more children if they had\r\neach a husband.” The Mormons reply that--setting aside the altered rule\r\nof production--their colony, unlike all others, numbers more female\r\nthan male immigrants; consequently that, without polygamy, part of the\r\nsocial field would remain untilled.[221]\r\n\r\n  [220] Hunting in the Himalaya, by R. H. W. Dunlop, C.B., B.C.S.,\r\n  F.R.G.S., London, Richard Bentley, 1860.\r\n\r\n  [221] I am sure of the correctness of this assertion, which is thus\r\n  denied in general terms by M. Reclus, of the Revue des Deux-Mondes.\r\n  “A la fin de 1858, on comptaît sur le Territoire 3617 maris\r\n  polygames, dont 1117 ayant cinque femmes ou d’avantage: mais un grand\r\n  nombre de Mormons n’avaient encore pu trouver d’épouses; il est\r\n  probable même que le chiffre des hommes depasse celui des femmes,\r\n  comme dans tous les pays peuplés d’emigrans. L’équilibre entre les\r\n  sexes n’est pas encore établi.”\r\n\r\nTo the unprejudiced traveler it appears that polygamy is the rule where\r\npopulation is required, and where the great social evil has not had\r\ntime to develop itself. In Paris or London the institution would, like\r\nslavery, die a natural death; in Arabia and in the wilds of the Rocky\r\nMountains it maintains a strong hold upon the affections of mankind.\r\nMonogamy is best fitted for the large, wealthy, and flourishing\r\ncommunities in which man is rarely the happier because his quiver is\r\nfull of children, and where the Hetæra becomes the succedaneum of\r\nthe “plurality-wife.” Polyandry has been practiced principally by\r\npriestly and barbarous tribes,[222] who fear most for the increase of\r\ntheir numbers, which would end by driving them to honest industry.\r\nIt reappears in a remarkable manner in the highest state of social\r\ncivilization, where excessive expenditure is an obstacle to freehold\r\nproperty, and the practice is probably on the increase.\r\n\r\n  [222] The Mahabharata thus relates the origin of the practice in\r\n  India. The five princely Pandava brothers, when contending for a\r\n  prize offered by the King of Drona to the most successful archer,\r\n  agreed to divide it if any of them should prove the winner. Arjun,\r\n  the eldest, was declared victor, and received in gift Draupadi, the\r\n  king’s daughter, who thus became the joint-stock property of the\r\n  whole fraternity. They lived _en famille_ for some years at the foot\r\n  of Bairath, the remains of which, or rather a Ghoorka structure on\r\n  the same site, are still visible on a hill near the N.W. corner of\r\n  the Dhun. (Hunting in the Himalaya, chap. vii.)\r\n\r\nThe other motive for polygamy in Utah is economy. Servants are rare and\r\ncostly; it is cheaper and more comfortable to marry them. Many converts\r\nare attracted by the prospect of becoming wives, especially from places\r\nwhere, like Clifton, there are sixty-four females to thirty-six males.\r\nThe old maid is, as she ought to be, an unknown entity. Life in the\r\nwilds of Western America is a course of severe toil: a single woman can\r\nnot perform the manifold duties of housekeeping, cooking, scrubbing,\r\nwashing, darning, child-bearing, and nursing a family. A division\r\nof labor is necessary, and she finds it by acquiring a sisterhood.\r\nThroughout the States, whenever a woman is seen at manual or outdoor\r\nwork, one is certain that she is Irish, German, or Scandinavian. The\r\ndelicacy and fragility of the Anglo-American female nature is at once\r\nthe cause and the effect of this exemption from toil.\r\n\r\n[MORMON WOMEN.--POLYGAMY.]\r\n\r\nThe moral influence diffused over social relations by the presence\r\nof polygyny will be intelligible only to those who have studied the\r\nworkings of the system in lands where seclusion is practiced in its\r\nmodified form, as among the Syrian Christians. In America society\r\nsplits into two parts--man and woman--even more readily than in\r\nEngland; each sex is freer and happier in the company of its congeners.\r\nAt Great Salt Lake City there is a gloom like that which the late\r\nProfessor H. H. Wilson described as being cast by the invading Moslem\r\nover the innocent gayety of the primitive Hindoo. The choice egotism\r\nof the heart called Love--that is to say, the propensity elevated\r\nby sentiment, and not undirected by reason, subsides into a calm\r\nand unimpassioned domestic attachment: romance and reverence are\r\ntransferred, with the true Mormon concentration, from love and liberty\r\nto religion and the Church. The consent of the first wife to a rival\r\nis seldom refused, and a _ménage à trois_, in the Mormon sense of the\r\nphrase, is fatal to the development of that tender tie which must be\r\nconfined to two. In its stead there is household comfort, affection,\r\ncircumspect friendship, and domestic discipline. Womanhood is not\r\npetted and spoiled as in the Eastern States; the inevitable cyclical\r\nrevolution, indeed, has rather placed her below par, where, however,\r\nI believe her to be happier than when set upon an uncomfortable and\r\nunnatural eminence.\r\n\r\nIt will be asked, What view does the softer sex take of polygyny?\r\nA few, mostly from the Old Country, lament that Mr. Joseph Smith\r\never asked of the Creator that question which was answered in the\r\naffirmative. A very few, like the Curia Electa, Emma, the first wife\r\nof Mr. Joseph Smith--who said of her, by-the-by, that she could not\r\nbe contented in heaven without rule--apostatize, and become Mrs.\r\nBridemann. The many are, as might be expected of the easily-moulded\r\nweaker vessel, which proves its inferior position by the delicate\r\nflattery of imitation, more in favor of polygyny than the stronger.\r\n\r\nFor the attachment of the women of the Saints to the doctrine of\r\nplurality there are many reasons. The Mormon prophets have expended\r\nall their arts upon this end, well knowing that without the hearty\r\nco-operation of mothers and wives, sisters and daughters, no\r\ninstitution can live long. They have bribed them with promises of\r\nParadise--they have subjugated them with threats of annihilation.\r\nWith them, once a Mormon always a Mormon. I have said that a modified\r\nreaction respecting the community of Saints has set in throughout\r\nthe States; people no longer wonder that their missionaries do not\r\nshow horns and cloven feet, and the federal officer, the itinerant\r\npolitician, the platform orator, and the place-seeking demagogue, can\r\nno longer make political capital by bullying, oppressing, and abusing\r\nthem. The tide has turned, and will turn yet more. But the individual\r\nstill suffers: the apostate Mormon is looked upon by other people as a\r\nscamp or a knave, and the woman worse than a prostitute. Again, all the\r\nfervor of a new faith burns in their bosoms with a heat which we can\r\nlittle appreciate, and the revelation of Mr. Joseph Smith is considered\r\non this point as superior to the Christian as the latter is in others\r\nto the Mosaic Dispensation. Polygamy is a positive command from heaven:\r\nif the flesh is mortified by it, _tant mieux_--“no cross, no crown;”\r\n“blessed are they that mourn.” I have heard these words from the lips\r\nof a well-educated Mormon woman, who, in the presence of a Gentile\r\nsister, urged her husband to take unto himself a second wife. The\r\nMormon household has been described by its enemies as a hell of envy,\r\nhatred, and malice--a den of murder and suicide. The same has been\r\nsaid of the Moslem harem. Both, I believe, suffer from the assertions\r\nof prejudice or ignorance. The temper of the New is so far superior to\r\nthat of the Old Country, that, incredible as the statement may appear,\r\nrival wives do dwell together in amity, and do quote the proverb “the\r\nmore the merrier.” Moreover, they look with horror at the position of\r\nthe “slavey” of a pauper mechanic at being required to “nigger it”\r\nupon love and starvation, and at the necessity of a numerous family.\r\nThey know that nine tenths of the miseries of the poor in large cities\r\narise from early and imprudent marriages, and they would rather be the\r\nfiftieth “sealing” of Dives than the toilsome single wife of Lazarus.\r\nThe French saying concerning motherhood--“_le premier embellit, le\r\nsecond détruit, le troisième gâte tout_,” is true in the Western world.\r\nThe first child is welcomed, the second is tolerated, the third is\r\nthe cause of tears and reproaches, and the fourth, if not prevented\r\nby gold pills or some similar monstrosity, causes temper, spleen, and\r\nmelancholy, with disgust and hatred of the cause. What the Napoleonic\r\nabolition of the law of primogeniture, combined with centralization of\r\nthe peasant class in towns and cities, has effected on this side of\r\nthe Channel, the terrors of maternity, aggravated by a highly nervous\r\ntemperament, small cerebellum, constitutional frigidity, and extreme\r\ndelicacy of fibre, have brought to pass in the older parts of the Union.\r\n\r\nAnother curious effect of fervent belief may be noticed in the married\r\nstate. When a man has four or five wives, with reasonable families by\r\neach, he is fixed for life: his interests, if not his affections, bind\r\nhim irrevocably to his new faith. But the bachelor, as well as the\r\nmonogamic youth, is prone to backsliding. Apostasy is apparently so\r\ncommon that many of the new Saints form a mere floating population. He\r\nis proved by a mission before being permitted to marry, and even then\r\nwomen, dreading a possible renegade, with the terrible consequences\r\nof a heavenless future to themselves, are shy of saying yes. Thus it\r\nhappens that male celibacy is mixed up in a curious way with polygamy,\r\nand that also in a faith whose interpreter advises youth not to remain\r\nsingle after sixteen, nor girls after fourteen. The celibacy also is\r\nabsolute; any infraction of it would be dangerous to life. Either,\r\nthen, the first propensity of the phrenologist is poorly developed\r\nin these lands--this has been positively stated of the ruder sex in\r\nCalifornia--or its action is to be regulated by habit to a greater\r\ndegree than is usually believed.\r\n\r\n[MRS. PRATT’S OPINION.]\r\n\r\nI am conscious that my narrative savors of incredibility; the fault is\r\nin the subject, not in the narrator. _Exoneravi animan meam._ The best\r\nproof that my opinions are correct will be the following quotation. It\r\nis a letter addressed to a sister in New Hampshire by a Mrs. Belinda\r\nM. Pratt, the wife of the celebrated apostle. M. Remy has apparently\r\ndramatized it (vol. ii., chap. ii.) by casting it into dialogue form,\r\nand placing it in the mouth of _une femme distinguée_. Most readers,\r\nfeminine and monogamic, will remark that the lady shows little heart\r\nor natural affection; the severe calm of her judgment and reasoning\r\nfaculties, and the soundness of her physiology, can not be doubted.\r\n\r\n  “Great Salt Lake City, Jan. 12, 1854.\r\n\r\n  “DEAR SISTER,--Your letter of October 2 was received on yesterday.\r\n  My joy on its reception was more than I can express. I had waited\r\n  so long for your answer to our last, that I had almost concluded my\r\n  friends were offended, and would write to me no more. Judge, then,\r\n  of my joy when I read the sentiments of friendship and of sisterly\r\n  affection expressed in your letter.\r\n\r\n  “We are all well here, and are prosperous and happy in our family\r\n  circle. My children, four in number, are healthy and cheerful, and\r\n  fast expanding their physical and intellectual faculties. Health,\r\n  peace, and prosperity have attended us all the day long.\r\n\r\n  “It seems, my dear sister, that we are no nearer together in our\r\n  religious views than formerly. Why is this? Are we not all bound to\r\n  leave this world, with all we possess therein, and reap the reward\r\n  of our doings _here_ in a never-ending hereafter? If so, do we not\r\n  desire to be undeceived, and to _know and to do the truth_? Do we not\r\n  all wish in our very hearts to be sincere with ourselves, and to be\r\n  honest and frank with each other?\r\n\r\n  “If so, you will bear with me patiently while I give a few of my\r\n  reasons for embracing and holding sacred that particular point in the\r\n  doctrine of the Church of the Saints to which you, my dear sister,\r\n  together with a large majority of Christendom, so decidedly object. I\r\n  mean, a ‘_plurality of wives_.’\r\n\r\n  “I have a Bible which I have been taught from my infancy to hold\r\n  sacred. In this Bible I read of a holy man named Abraham, who is\r\n  represented as the friend of God, a faithful man in all things, a\r\n  man who kept the commandments of God, and who is called in the New\r\n  Testament ‘the father of the faithful.’ See James, ii., 23; Rom.,\r\n  iv., 16; Gal., iii., 8, 9, 16, 29.\r\n\r\n  “I find this man had a plurality of wives, some of which were called\r\n  concubines. See Book of Genesis; and for his concubines, see xxv., 6.\r\n\r\n  “I also find his grandson Jacob possessed of four wives, twelve\r\n  sons, and a daughter. These wives are spoken very highly of by the\r\n  sacred writers as honorable and virtuous women. ‘_These_,’ say the\r\n  Scriptures, ‘_did build the house of Israel_.’\r\n\r\n  “Jacob himself was also a man of God, and the Lord blessed him and\r\n  his house, and commanded him to be fruitful and multiply. See Gen.,\r\n  xxx. to xxxv., and particularly xxxv., 10,11.\r\n\r\n  “I find also that the twelve sons of Jacob by these four wives\r\n  became princes, heads of tribes, patriarchs, whose names are had in\r\n  everlasting remembrance to all generations.\r\n\r\n  “Now God talked with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob frequently, and his\r\n  angels also visited and talked with them, and blessed them and their\r\n  wives and children. He also reproved the sins of some of the sons\r\n  of Jacob for hating and selling their brother, and for adultery.\r\n  But in all his communications with them he never condemned their\r\n  family organization, but, on the contrary, always approved of it,\r\n  and blessed them in this respect. He even told Abraham that he would\r\n  make him the father of many nations, and that in him and his seed all\r\n  the nations and kindreds of the earth should be blessed. See Gen.,\r\n  xviii., 17-19; also xii., 1-3. In later years I find the plurality of\r\n  wives perpetuated, sanctioned, and provided for in the law of Moses.\r\n\r\n  “David the Psalmist not only had a plurality of wives, but the Lord\r\n  himself spoke by the mouth of Nathan the prophet, and told David that\r\n  _he_ (the Lord) had given his master’s wives into his bosom; but\r\n  because he had committed adultery with the wife of Uriah, and had\r\n  caused his murder, _he_ would take _his_ wives and give them to a\r\n  neighbor of his, etc. See 2 Sam., xii., 7-11.\r\n\r\n  “Here, then, we have the Word of the Lord not only sanctioning\r\n  polygamy, but actually giving to King David the wives of his master\r\n  (Saul), and afterward taking the wives of David from him, and giving\r\n  them to another man. Here we have a sample of severe reproof and\r\n  punishment for adultery and murder, while polygamy is authorized and\r\n  approved by the Word of God.\r\n\r\n  “But to come to the New Testament. I find Jesus Christ speaks very\r\n  highly of Abraham and his family. He says, ‘_Many shall come from\r\n  the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south,\r\n  and shall sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of\r\n  God_.’ Luke, xiii., 28, 29.\r\n\r\n  “Again he said, ‘_If ye were Abraham’s seed ye would do the works of\r\n  Abraham_.’\r\n\r\n  “Paul the apostle wrote to the saints of his day, and informed them\r\n  as follows: ‘As many of you as have been baptized into Christ have\r\n  put on Christ; and if ye are Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed,\r\n  and heirs according to the promise.’\r\n\r\n  “He also sets forth Abraham and Sarah as patterns of faith and good\r\n  works, and as the father and mother of faithful Christians, who\r\n  should, by faith and good works, aspire to be counted the sons of\r\n  Abraham and daughters of Sarah.\r\n\r\n  “Now let us look at some of the works of Sarah, for which she is so\r\n  highly commended by the apostles, and by them held up as a pattern\r\n  for Christian ladies to imitate. ‘_Now Sarah, Abram’s wife, bare\r\n  him no children; and she had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name\r\n  was Hagar. And Sarah said unto Abram, Behold now, the Lord hath\r\n  restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid: it may\r\n  be that I may obtain children of her. And Abram hearkened unto the\r\n  voice of Sarah. And Sarah, Abram’s wife, took Hagar her maid, the\r\n  Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and\r\n  gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife._’ See Gen., xvi., 1-3.\r\n\r\n  “According to Jesus Christ and the apostles, then, the only way to be\r\n  saved is to be adopted into the great family of polygamists by the\r\n  Gospel, and then strictly follow their examples.\r\n\r\n  “Again, John the Revelator describes the Holy City of the heavenly\r\n  Jerusalem, with the names of the twelve sons of Jacob inscribed on\r\n  the gates. Rev., xxi., 12.\r\n\r\n  “To sum up the whole, then, I find that polygamists were the friends\r\n  of God; that the family and lineage of a polygamist were selected\r\n  in which all nations should be blessed; that a polygamist is named\r\n  in the New Testament as the father of the faithful Christians of\r\n  after ages, and cited as a pattern for all generations; that the\r\n  wife of a polygamist, who encouraged her husband in the practice of\r\n  the same, and even urged him into it, and officiated in giving him\r\n  another wife, is named as an honorable and virtuous woman, a pattern\r\n  for Christian ladies, and the very mother of all holy women in the\r\n  Christian Church, whose aspiration it should be to be called her\r\n  daughters; that Jesus Christ has declared that the great fathers of\r\n  the polygamic family stand at the head in the kingdom of good; in\r\n  short, that all the saved of after generations should be saved by\r\n  becoming members of a polygamic family; that all those who do not\r\n  become members of it are strangers and aliens to the covenant of\r\n  promise, the commonwealth of Israel, and not heirs according to the\r\n  promise made to Abraham; that all people from the east, west, north,\r\n  or south, who enter into the kingdom, enter into the society of\r\n  polygamists, and under their patriarchal rule and government; indeed,\r\n  no one can even approach the gates of heaven without beholding the\r\n  names of twelve polygamists (the sons of four different women by one\r\n  man) engraven in everlasting glory upon the pearly gates.\r\n\r\n  “My dear sister, with the Scriptures before me, I could never find it\r\n  in my heart to reject the heavenly vision which has restored to man\r\n  the fullness of the Gospel, or the Latter-Day prophets and apostles,\r\n  merely because in this restoration is included the ancient law of\r\n  family organization and government preparatory to the restoration of\r\n  all Israel.\r\n\r\n  “But, leaving all Scripture, history, or precedent out of the\r\n  question, let us come to Nature’s law. What, then, appears to be the\r\n  great object of the marriage relations? I answer, the multiplying of\r\n  our species, the rearing and training of children.\r\n\r\n  “To accomplish this object, natural law would dictate that a husband\r\n  should remain apart from his wife at certain seasons, which, in the\r\n  very constitution of the female, are untimely; or, in other words,\r\n  indulgence should be not merely for pleasure or wanton desires, but\r\n  mainly for the purpose of procreation.\r\n\r\n  “The mortality of nature would teach a mother that, during Nature’s\r\n  process in the formation and growth of embryo man, her heart should\r\n  be pure, her thoughts and affections chaste, her mind calm, her\r\n  passions without excitement, while her body should be invigorated\r\n  with every exercise conducive to health and vigor, but by no means\r\n  subjected to any thing calculated to disturb, irritate, weary, or\r\n  exhaust any of its functions.\r\n\r\n  “And while a kind husband should nourish, sustain, and comfort the\r\n  wife of his bosom by every kindness and attention consistent with her\r\n  situation and with his most tender affection, still he should refrain\r\n  from all those untimely associations which are forbidden in the great\r\n  constitutional laws of female nature, which laws we see carried out\r\n  in almost the entire animal economy, human animals excepted.\r\n\r\n  “Polygamy, then, as practiced under the patriarchal law of God, tends\r\n  directly to the chastity of women, and to sound health and morals in\r\n  the constitutions of their offspring.\r\n\r\n  “You can read in the law of God, in your Bible, the times and\r\n  circumstances under which a woman should remain apart from her\r\n  husband, during which times she is considered unclean; and should her\r\n  husband come to her bed under such circumstances, he would commit a\r\n  gross sin both against the laws of nature and the wise provisions\r\n  of God’s law, as revealed in his word; in short, he would commit an\r\n  abomination; he would sin both against his own body, against the body\r\n  of his wife, and against the laws of procreation, in which the health\r\n  and morals of his offspring are directly concerned.\r\n\r\n  “The polygamic law of God opens to all vigorous, healthy, and\r\n  virtuous females a door by which they may become honorable wives\r\n  of virtuous men, and mothers of faithful, virtuous, healthy, and\r\n  vigorous children.\r\n\r\n  “And here let me ask you, my dear sister, what female in all New\r\n  Hampshire would marry a drunkard, a man of hereditary disease, a\r\n  debauchee, an idler, or a spendthrift; or what woman would become a\r\n  prostitute, or, on the other hand, live and die single, or without\r\n  forming those inexpressibly dear relationships of wife and mother,\r\n  if the Abrahamic covenant, or patriarchal laws of God, were extended\r\n  over your State, and held sacred and honorable by all?\r\n\r\n  “Dear sister, in your thoughtlessness you inquire, ‘Why not a\r\n  plurality of husbands as well as a plurality of wives?’ To which I\r\n  reply, 1st. God has never commanded or sanctioned a plurality of\r\n  husbands; 2d. ‘_Man is the head of the woman_,’ and no woman can\r\n  serve two lords; 3d. Such an order of things would work death and\r\n  not life, or, in plain language, it would multiply disease instead\r\n  of children. In fact, the experiment of a plurality of husbands,\r\n  or rather of one woman for many men, is in active operation, and\r\n  has been for centuries, in all the principal towns and cities of\r\n  ‘_Christendom!_’ It is the genius of ‘_Christian institutions_,’\r\n  falsely so called. It is the result of ‘_Mystery Babylon, the great\r\n  whore of all the earth_.’ Or, in other words, it is the result of\r\n  making void the holy ordinances of God in relation to matrimony,\r\n  and introducing the laws of Rome, in which the clergy and nuns\r\n  are forbidden to marry, and other members only permitted to have\r\n  one wife. This law leaves females exposed to a life of single\r\n  ‘_blessedness_,’ without husband, child, or friend to provide for\r\n  or comfort them; or to a life of poverty and loneliness, exposed to\r\n  temptation, to perverted affections, to unlawful means to gratify\r\n  them, or to the necessity of selling themselves for lucre. While the\r\n  man who has abundance of means is tempted to spend it on a mistress\r\n  in secret, and in a lawless way, the law of God would have given her\r\n  to him as an honorable wife. These circumstances give rise to murder,\r\n  infanticide, suicide, disease, remorse, despair, wretchedness,\r\n  poverty, untimely death, with all the attendant train of jealousies,\r\n  heartrending miseries, want of confidence in families, contaminating\r\n  disease, etc.; and, finally, to the horrible license system, in which\r\n  governments called Christian license their fair daughters, I will\r\n  not say to play the beast, but to a degradation far beneath them;\r\n  for every species of the animal creation, except man, refrain from\r\n  such abominable excesses, and observe in a great measure the laws of\r\n  nature in procreation.\r\n\r\n  “I again repeat that Nature has constituted the female differently\r\n  from the male, and for a different purpose. The strength of the\r\n  female constitution is designed to flow in a stream of _life_, to\r\n  nourish and sustain the embryo, to bring it forth, and to nurse it\r\n  on her bosom. When Nature is not in operation within her in these\r\n  particulars and for these heavenly ends, it has wisely provided\r\n  relief at regular periods, in order that her system may be kept pure\r\n  and healthy, without exhausting the fountain of life on the one hand,\r\n  or drying up its river of life on the other, till mature age and an\r\n  approaching change of worlds render it necessary for her to cease\r\n  to be fruitful, and give her to rest a while, and enjoy a tranquil\r\n  life in the midst of that family circle, endeared to her by so many\r\n  ties, and which may be supposed, at this period of her life, to be\r\n  approaching the vigor of manhood, and therefore able to comfort and\r\n  sustain her.\r\n\r\n  “Not so with man. He has no such drawback upon his strength. It is\r\n  his to move in a wider sphere. If God shall count him worthy of a\r\n  hundred fold in this life of wives and children, and houses, and\r\n  lands, and kindreds, he may even aspire to patriarchal sovereignty,\r\n  to empire; to be the prince or head of a tribe or tribes; and,\r\n  like Abraham of old, be able to send forth, for the defense of his\r\n  country, hundreds and thousands of his own warriors, born in his own\r\n  house.\r\n\r\n  “A noble man of God, who is full of the Spirit of the Most High,\r\n  and is counted worthy to converse with Jehovah or with the Son of\r\n  God, and to associate with angels and the spirits of just men made\r\n  perfect--one who will teach his children, and bring them up in the\r\n  light of unadulterated and eternal truth--is more worthy of a hundred\r\n  wives and children than the ignorant slave of passion, or of vice and\r\n  folly, is to have one wife and one child. Indeed, the God of Abraham\r\n  is so much better pleased with one than with the other, that he would\r\n  even take away the one talent, which is habitually abused, neglected,\r\n  or put to an improper use, and give it to him who has ten talents.\r\n\r\n  “In the patriarchal order of family government the wife is bound\r\n  to the law of her husband. She honors, ‘_calls him lord_,’ even as\r\n  Sarah obeyed and honored Abraham. She lives for him, and to increase\r\n  his glory, his greatness, his kingdom, or family. Her affections are\r\n  centred in her God, her husband, and her children.\r\n\r\n  “The children are also under his government worlds without end.\r\n  ‘_While life, or thought, or being lasts, or immortality endures_,’\r\n  they are bound to obey him as their father and king.\r\n\r\n  “He also has a head to whom he is responsible. He must keep the\r\n  commandments of God and observe his laws. He must not take a wife\r\n  unless she is given to him by the law and authority of God. He must\r\n  not commit adultery, nor take liberties with any woman except his\r\n  own, who are secured to him by the holy ordinances of matrimony.\r\n\r\n  “Hence a nation organized under the law of the Gospel, or, in\r\n  other words, the law of Abraham and the patriarchs, would have no\r\n  institutions tending to licentiousness; no adulteries, fornications,\r\n  etc., would be tolerated. No houses or institutions would exist\r\n  for traffic in shame, or in the life-blood of our fair daughters.\r\n  Wealthy men would have no inducement to keep a mistress in secret,\r\n  or unlawfully. Females would have no grounds for temptation in any\r\n  such lawless life. Neither money nor pleasure could tempt them, nor\r\n  poverty drive them to any such excess, because the door would be\r\n  open for every virtuous female to form the honorable and endearing\r\n  relationships of wife and mother in some virtuous family, where\r\n  love, and peace, and plenty would crown her days, and truth and the\r\n  practice of virtue qualify her to be transplanted with her family\r\n  circle in that eternal soil where they might multiply their children\r\n  without pain, or sorrow, or death, and go on increasing in numbers,\r\n  in wealth, in greatness, in glory, might, majesty, power, and\r\n  dominion, in worlds without end.\r\n\r\n  “Oh my dear sister, could the dark veil of tradition be rent from\r\n  your mind--could you gaze for a moment on the resurrection of the\r\n  just--could you behold Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wives\r\n  and children, clad in the bloom, freshness, and beauty of immortal\r\n  _flesh and bones_--clothed in robes of fine white linen, bedecked\r\n  with precious stones and gold, and surrounded with an offspring\r\n  of immortals as countless as the stars of the firmament or as the\r\n  grains of sand upon the sea-shore, over which they reign as kings and\r\n  queens forever and ever, you would then know something of the weight\r\n  of those words of the sacred writer which are recorded in relation\r\n  to the four wives of Jacob, the mothers of the twelve patriarchs,\r\n  namely, ‘_These did build the house of Israel_.’\r\n\r\n  “Oh that my dear kindred could but realize that they have need\r\n  to repent of the sins, ignorance, and traditions of those\r\n  perverted systems which are misnamed ‘_Christianity_,’ and be\r\n  baptized--_buried_ in the water, in the likeness of the death and\r\n  burial of Jesus Christ, and rise to newness of life in the likeness\r\n  of his resurrection; receive his Spirit by the laying on of the\r\n  hands of an apostle, according to promise, and forsake the world and\r\n  the pride thereof. Thus they would be adopted into the family of\r\n  Abraham, become his sons and daughters, see and enjoy for themselves\r\n  the visions of the Spirit of eternal truth, which bear witness of\r\n  the family order of heaven, and the beauties and glories of eternal\r\n  kindred ties, for my pen can never describe them.\r\n\r\n  “Dear, _dear_ kindred: remember, according to the New Testament,\r\n  and the testimony of an ancient apostle, if you are ever saved in\r\n  the kingdom of God, it must be by being adopted into the family of\r\n  polygamists--the family of the great patriarch Abraham; for in his\r\n  seed, or family, and not out of it, ‘_shall all the nations and\r\n  kindreds of the earth be blessed_.’\r\n\r\n  “You say you believe polygamy is ‘_licentious_;’ that it is\r\n  ‘_abominable_,’ ‘_beastly_,’ etc.; ‘the practice only of the most\r\n  barbarous nations, or of the Dark Ages, or of some great or good men\r\n  who were left to commit gross sins.’ Yet you say you are anxious for\r\n  me to be converted to your faith; and that we may see each other in\r\n  this life, and be associated in one great family in that life which\r\n  has no end.\r\n\r\n  “Now, in order to comply with your wishes, I must renounce the Old\r\n  and New Testaments; must count Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their\r\n  families, as licentious, wicked, beastly, abominable characters;\r\n  Moses, Nathan, David, and the prophets, no better. I must look upon\r\n  the God of Israel as partaker in all these abominations, by holding\r\n  them in fellowship; and even as a minister of such iniquity, by\r\n  giving King Saul’s wives into King David’s bosom, and afterward by\r\n  taking David’s wives from him, and giving them to his neighbor. I\r\n  must consider Jesus Christ, and Paul, and John, as either living in a\r\n  dark age, as full of the darkness and ignorance of barbarous climes,\r\n  or else willfully abominable and wicked in fellowshiping polygamists,\r\n  and representing them as fathers of the faithful and rulers in\r\n  heaven. I must doom them all to hell, with adulterers, fornicators,\r\n  etc., or else, at least, assign to them some nook or corner in\r\n  heaven, as ignorant persons, who, knowing but little, were beaten\r\n  with few stripes; while, by analogy, I must learn to consider the\r\n  Roman popes, clergy, and nuns, who do not marry at all, as foremost\r\n  in the ranks of glory, and those Catholics and Protestants who have\r\n  but one wife as next in order of salvation, glory, immortality, and\r\n  eternal life.\r\n\r\n  “Now, dear friends, much as I long to see you, and dear as you are\r\n  to me, I can never come to these terms. I feel as though the Gospel\r\n  had introduced me into the right family, into the right lineage, and\r\n  into good company. And, besides all these considerations, should\r\n  I ever become so beclouded with unbelief of the Scriptures and\r\n  heavenly institutions as to agree with my kindred in New Hampshire in\r\n  _theory_, still my practical circumstances are different, and would,\r\n  I fear, continue to separate us by a wide and almost impassable gulf.\r\n\r\n  “For instance, I have (as you see, in all good conscience, founded\r\n  on the Word of God) formed family and kindred ties which are\r\n  inexpressibly dear to me, and which I can never bring my feelings to\r\n  consent to dissolve. I have a good and virtuous husband whom I love.\r\n  We have four little children which are mutually and inexpressibly\r\n  dear to us. And, besides this, my husband has seven other living\r\n  wives, and one who has departed to a better world. He has in all\r\n  upward of twenty-five children. All these mothers and children are\r\n  endeared to me by kindred ties, by mutual affection, by acquaintance\r\n  and association; and the mothers in particular, by mutual and\r\n  long-continued exercises of toil, patience, long-suffering, and\r\n  sisterly kindness. We all have our imperfections in this life; but\r\n  I know that these are good and worthy women, and that my husband\r\n  is a good and worthy man; one who keeps the commandments of Jesus\r\n  Christ, and presides in his family like an Abraham. He seeks to\r\n  provide for them with all diligence; he loves them all, and seeks to\r\n  comfort them and make them happy. He teaches them the commandments\r\n  of Jesus Christ, and gathers them about him in the family circle to\r\n  call upon his God, both morning and evening. He and his family have\r\n  the confidence, esteem, good-will, and fellowship of this entire\r\n  Territory, and of a wide circle of acquaintances in Europe and\r\n  America. He is a practical teacher of morals and religion, a promoter\r\n  of general education, and at present occupies an honorable seat in\r\n  the Legislative Council of this Territory.\r\n\r\n  “Now, as to visiting my kindred in New Hampshire, I would be pleased\r\n  to do so were it the will of God. But, first, the laws of that State\r\n  must be so modified by enlightened legislation, and the customs and\r\n  consciences of its inhabitants, and of my kindred, so altered, that\r\n  my husband can accompany me with all his wives and children, and be\r\n  as much respected and honored in his family organization and in his\r\n  holy calling as he is at home, or in the same manner as the patriarch\r\n  Jacob would have been respected had he, with his wives and children,\r\n  paid a visit to his kindred. As my husband is yet in his youth, as\r\n  well as myself, I fondly hope we shall live to see that day; for\r\n  already the star of Jacob is in the ascendency; the house of Israel\r\n  is about to be restored; while ‘_Mystery Babylon_,’ with all her\r\n  institutions, awaits her own overthrow. Till this is the case in New\r\n  Hampshire, my kindred will be under the necessity of coming here\r\n  to see us, or, on the other hand, we will be mutually compelled to\r\n  forego the pleasure of each other’s company.\r\n\r\n  “You mention in your letter that Paul the apostle recommended that\r\n  bishops be the husband of one wife. Why this was the case I do not\r\n  know, unless it was, as he says, that while he was among Romans he\r\n  did as Romans did. Rome at that time governed the world, as it were;\r\n  and, although gross idolaters, they held to the one-wife system.\r\n  Under these circumstances, no doubt, the apostle Paul, seeing a great\r\n  many polygamists in the Church, recommended that they had better\r\n  choose for this particular temporal office men of small families, who\r\n  would not be in disrepute with the government. This is precisely our\r\n  course in those countries where Roman institutions still bear sway.\r\n  Our elders there have but one wife, in order to conform to the laws\r\n  of men.\r\n\r\n  “You inquire why Elder W., when at your house, denied that the Church\r\n  of this age held to the doctrine of plurality. I answer that he might\r\n  have been ignorant of the fact, as our belief on this point was not\r\n  published till 1852. And had he known it, he had no right to reveal\r\n  the same until the full time had arrived. God kindly withheld this\r\n  doctrine for a time, because of the ignorance and prejudice of the\r\n  nations of mystic Babylon, that peradventure he might save some of\r\n  them.\r\n\r\n  “Now, dear sister, I must close. I wish all my kindred and old\r\n  acquaintances to see this letter, or a copy thereof, and that they\r\n  will consider it as if written to themselves. I love them dearly, and\r\n  greatly desire and pray for their salvation, and that we may all meet\r\n  with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of God.\r\n\r\n  “Dear sister, do not let your prejudices and traditions keep you from\r\n  believing the Bible, nor the pride, shame, or love of the world keep\r\n  you from your seat in the kingdom of heaven, among the royal family\r\n  of polygamists. Write often and freely.\r\n\r\n  “With sentiments of the deepest affection and kindred feeling, I\r\n  remain, dear sister, your affectionate sister,\r\n\r\n  “BELINDA MARDEN PRATT.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nLast Days at Great Salt Lake City.\r\n\r\n\r\nI now terminate my observations upon the subject of Mormonism. It will\r\nbe remarked that the opinions of others--not my own--have been recorded\r\nas carefully as my means of study have permitted, and that facts, not\r\ntheories, have been the object of this dissertation.\r\n\r\n[MORMONISM THE FAITH OF THE POOR.]\r\n\r\nIt will, I think, be abundantly evident that Utah Territory has been\r\nsuccessful in its colonization. Every where, indeed, in the New World,\r\nthe stranger wonders that a poor man should tarry in Europe, or that\r\na rich man should remain in America; nothing but the strongest chains\r\nof habit and _vis inertiæ_ can reconcile both to their miserable lots.\r\nI can not help thinking that, morally and spiritually, as well as\r\nphysically, the _protégés_ of the Perpetual Emigration Fund gain by\r\nbeing transferred to the Far West. Mormonism is emphatically the faith\r\nof the poor, and those acquainted with the wretched condition of the\r\nEnglish mechanic, collier, and agricultural laborer--it is calculated\r\nthat a million of them exist on £25 per annum--who, after a life of\r\nignoble drudgery, of toiling through the year from morning till night,\r\nare ever threatened with the work-house, must be of the same opinion.\r\nPhysically speaking, there is no comparison between the conditions of\r\nthe Saints and the class from which they are mostly taken. In point of\r\nmere morality, the Mormon community is perhaps purer than any other\r\nof equal numbers.[223] I have no wish to commend their spiritual, or,\r\nrather, their materialistic vagaries--a materialism so leveling in its\r\nunauthorized deductions that even the materialist must reject it; but\r\nwith the mind as with the body, bad food is better than none. When\r\nwealth shall be less unequally distributed in England, thus doing away\r\nwith the contrast of excessive splendor and utter destitution, and when\r\nHome Missions shall have done their duty in educating and evangelizing\r\nthe unhappy pariahs of town and country, the sons of the land which\r\nboasts herself to be the foremost among the nations will blush no more\r\nto hear that the Mormons or Latter-Day Saints are mostly English.\r\n\r\n  [223] I refer the reader to Appendix IV.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of September the time of my departure drew nigh. Judge\r\nFlennikin found a change of _venue_ to Carson Valley necessary; Thomas,\r\nhis son, was to accompany him, and the Territorial marshal, Mr.\r\nGrice--a quondam volunteer in the Mexican War--was part of the cortége.\r\nEscort and ambulance had been refused; it was imperative to find both.\r\nSeveral proposals were made and rejected. At last an eligible presented\r\nhimself. Mr. Kennedy, an Irishman from the neighborhood of Dublin, and\r\nan _incola_ of California, where evil fate had made him a widower, had\r\n“swapped” stock, and was about to drive thirty-three horses and mules\r\nto the “El Dorado of the West.” For the sum of $150 each he agreed\r\nto convey us, to provide an ambulance which cost him $300, and three\r\nwagons which varied in price from $25 to $75. We had reason to think\r\nwell of his probity, concerning which we had taken counsel; and as he\r\nhad lost a horse or two, and had received a bullet through the right\r\narm in an encounter with the Yuta Indians near Deep Creek on the 3d\r\nof July of the same year, we had little doubt of his behaving with\r\ndue prudence. He promised also to collect a sufficient armed party;\r\nand as the road had lately seen troubles--three drivers had been\r\nshot and seventeen Indians had been reported slain in action by the\r\nfederal troops--we were certain that he would keep his word. It was the\r\nbeginning of the hungry season, when the Indians would be collecting\r\ntheir pine nuts and be plotting onslaughts upon the spring emigrants.\r\n\r\nI prepared for difficulties by having my hair “shingled off” till\r\nmy head somewhat resembled a pointer’s dorsum, and deeply regretted\r\nhaving left all my wigs behind me. The marshal undertook to lay in our\r\nprovisions: we bought flour, hard bread or biscuit, eggs and bacon,\r\nbutter, a few potted luxuries, not forgetting a goodly allowance of\r\nwhisky and korn schnapps, whose only demerit was that it gave a taste\r\nto the next morning. The traveling canteen consisted of a little china,\r\ntin cups and plates, a coffee-pot, frying-pan, and large ditto for\r\nbread-baking, with spoons, knives, and forks.\r\n\r\n[ADIEUX.]\r\n\r\nThe last preparations were soon made. I wrote to my friends, among\r\nothers to Dr. Norton Shaw, who read out the missive _magno cum risu\r\naudientium_, bought a pair of leather leggins for $5, settled with M.\r\nGebow, a Gamaliel at whose feet I had sat as a student of the Yuta\r\ndialect, and defrayed the expenses of living, which, though the bill\r\nwas curiously worded,[224] were exemplarily inexpensive. Colonel\r\nStambaugh favored me with a parting gift, the “Manual of Surveying\r\nInstructions,” which I preserve as a reminiscence, and a cocktail whose\r\naroma still lingers in my olfactories. My last evening was spent with\r\nMr. Stambaugh, when Mr. John Taylor was present, and where, with the\r\nkindly aid of Madam, we drank a _café au lait_ as good as the _Café\r\nde Paris_ affords. I thanked the governor for his frank and generous\r\nhospitality, and made my acknowledgments to his amiable wife. All\r\nmy adieux were upon an extensive scale, the immediate future being\r\nsomewhat dark and menacing.\r\n\r\n  [224] The bill in question:\r\n\r\n  Gt. S. L.

We were\r\nto depart on Wednesday, the 19th of September, at 8 A.M.--then 10\r\nA.M.--then 12 A.M.--then, after a deprecatory visit, on the morrow.\r\nOn the morning of the eventful next day, after the usual amount of\r\n“smiling,” and a repetition of adieux, I found myself “all aboord,”\r\nwending southward, and mentally ejaculating _Hierosolymam quando\r\nrevisam?_\r\n\r\n[MOUNT NEBO.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOUNT NEBO.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTo Ruby Valley.\r\n\r\n\r\nMounted upon a fine mule, here worth $240, and “bound” to fetch in\r\nCalifornia $400, and accompanying a Gentile youth who answered to the\r\nname of Joe, I proceeded to take my first lesson in stock-driving.\r\nWe were convoying ten horses, which, not being wild, declined to\r\nherd together, and, by their straggling, made the task not a little\r\ndifficult to a tyro. The road was that leading to Camp Floyd before\r\ndescribed. At the Brewery near Mountain Point we found some attempts at\r\na station, and were charged $1 50 for frijoles, potatoes, and bread:\r\namong other decorations on the wall was a sheet of prize-fighters, in\r\nwhich appeared the portraiture of an old man, once the champion of the\r\nlight weights in the English ring, now a Saint in Great Salt Lake City.\r\nThe day was fine and wondrous clear, affording us a splendid back view\r\nof the Happy Valley before it was finally shut out from sight, and\r\nthe Utah Lake looked a very gem of beauty, a diamond in its setting\r\nof steely blue mountains. After fording the Jordan we were overtaken\r\nby Mr. Kennedy, who had been delayed by more last words, and at the\r\ndug-out we drank beer with Shropshire Joe the Mormon, who had been\r\nvainly attempting to dig water by a divining rod of peach-tree. When\r\nmoonlight began to appear, Joe the Gentile was ordered by the “boss”\r\nto camp out with the horses, where fodder could be found gratis, a\r\ncommandment which he obeyed with no end of grumbling. It was deep in\r\nthe night before we entered Frogtown, where a creaking little Osteria\r\nsupplied us with supper, and I found a bed at the quarters of my friend\r\nCaptain Heth, who obligingly insisted upon my becoming his guest.\r\n\r\nThe five days between the 20th and the 26th of September sped merrily\r\nat my new home, Camp Floyd; not pressed for time, I embraced with\r\npleasure the opportunity of seeing the most of my American brothers\r\nin arms. My host was a son of that Old Dominion of Queen Elizabeth,\r\nwhere still linger traces of the glorious Cavalier and the noble feudal\r\nspirit, which (alas!) have almost disappeared from the mother country;\r\nwhere the genealogical tree still hangs against the wall; where the\r\nprincipal families, the Nelsons, Harrisons, Pages, Seldens, and Allens,\r\nintermarry and bravely attempt to entail; and where the houses,\r\nbuilt of brick brought out from England, still retain traces of the\r\nseventeenth century. A winter indeed might be passed most pleasantly\r\non the banks of James River and in the west of Virginia--a refreshing\r\nwinter to those who love, as I do, the traditions of our ancestors.\r\n\r\n[SPREES.]\r\n\r\nFrom Captain Heth I gathered that in former times, in Western America\r\nas in British India, a fair aborigine was not unfrequently the\r\ncopartner of an officer’s hut or tent. The improved communication,\r\nhowever, and the frequency of marriage, have abolished the custom by\r\nrendering it unfashionable. The Indian squaw, like the Beebee, seldom\r\nlooked upon her “mari” in any other light but her banker. An inveterate\r\nbeggar, she would beg for all her relations, for all her friends, and\r\nall her tribe, rather than not beg at all, and the lavatory process\r\nrequired always to be prefaced with the bribe. Officers who were long\r\nthrown among the Prairie Indians joined, as did the Anglo-Indian, in\r\ntheir nautches and other amusements, where, if whisky was present, a\r\ncut or stab might momentarily be expected. The skin was painted white,\r\nblack, and red, the hair was dressed and decorated, and the shirt\r\nwas tied round the waist, while broadcloth and blanket, leggins and\r\nmoccasins completed the costume. The “crack thing to do” when drinking\r\nwith Indians, and listening to their monotonous songs and tales, was\r\nto imitate Indian customs; to become, under the influence of the jolly\r\ngod, a Hatim Tai; exceedingly generous; to throw shirt to one man,\r\nblanket to another, leggins to a third--in fact, to return home in\r\nbreech-cloth. Such sprees would have been severely treated by a highly\r\nrespectable government; they have now, however, like many a pleasant\r\nhour in British India, had their day, and are sunk, many a fathom deep,\r\nin the genuine Anglo-Scandinavian gloom.\r\n\r\n[ARMY GRIEVANCES.]\r\n\r\nI heard more of army grievances during my second stay at Camp Floyd.\r\nThe term of a soldier’s enlistment, five years, is too short,\r\nespecially for the cavalry branch, and the facilities for desertion\r\nare enormous. Between the two, one third of the army disappears every\r\nyear. The company which should number 84 has often only 50 men. The\r\nsoldier has no time to learn his work; he must drive wagons, clear\r\nbush, make roads, and build huts and stables. When thoroughly drilled\r\nhe can take his discharge, and having filled a purse out of his very\r\nliberal pay ($11 per mensem), he generally buys ground and becomes\r\na landed proprietor. The officers are equally well salaried; but\r\nmarching, countermarching, and contingent expenses are heavy enough to\r\nmake the profession little better than it is in France. The Secretary\r\nof War being a civilian, with naturally the highest theoretical idea of\r\ndiscipline and command combined with economy, is always a martinet; no\r\none can exceed the minutest order, and leave is always obtained under\r\ndifficulties. As the larger proportion of the officers are Southern\r\nmen, especially Virginians, and as the soldiers are almost entirely\r\nGermans and Irish--the Egyptians of modern times--the federal army will\r\ntake little part in the ensuing contest. It is more than probable that\r\nthe force will disband, break in two like the nationalities from which\r\nit is drawn. As far as I could judge of American officers, they are\r\nabout as republican in mind and tone of thought as those of the British\r\narmy. They are aware of the fact that the bundle of sticks requires a\r\ntie, but they prefer, as we all do, King Stork to King Log, and King\r\nLog to King Mob.\r\n\r\nI took sundry opportunities of attending company inspections, and found\r\nthe men well dressed and tolerably set up, while the bands, being\r\nGerman, were of course excellent. Mr. Chandless and others talk of\r\nthe United States army discipline as something Draconian; severity is\r\ndoubtless necessary in a force so constituted, but--a proof of their\r\nclemency--desertion is the only crime punishable by flogging. The\r\nuniform is a study. The States have attempted in the dress of their\r\narmy, as in the forms of their government, a moral impossibility. It is\r\nexpected to be at once cheap and soldier-like, useful and ornamental,\r\nlight and heavy, pleasantly hot in the arctic regions, and agreeably\r\ncool under the tropics. The “military tailors” of the English army\r\nsimilarly forget the number of changes required in civilian raiment,\r\nand, looking to the lightness of the soldier’s kit, wholly neglect\r\nits efficiency, its capability of preserving the soldier’s life. The\r\nfederal uniform consists of a brigand-like and bizarre sombrero, with\r\nMephistophelian cock-plume, and of a blue broadcloth tunic, imitated\r\nfrom the old Kentuckian hunter’s surtout or wrapper, with terminations\r\nsometimes made to match, at other times too dark and dingy to please\r\nthe eye. Its principal merit is a severe republican plainness, very\r\nconsistent with the prepossessions of the people, highly inconsistent\r\nwith the customs of military nations. Soldiers love to dress up Mars,\r\nnot to clothe him like a butcher’s boy.\r\n\r\nThe position of Camp Floyd is a mere brick-yard, a basin surrounded\r\nby low hills, which an Indian pony would have little difficulty in\r\ntraversing; sometimes, however, after the fashion of the land, though\r\napparently easy from afar, the summits assume a mural shape, which\r\nwould stop any thing but a mountain sheep. The rim shows anticlinal\r\nstrata, evidencing upheavals, disruption, and, lastly, drainage\r\nthrough the kanyons which break the wall. The principal vegetation is\r\nthe dwarf cedar above, the sage greenwood and rabbit-bush below. The\r\nonly animals seen upon the plain are jackass-rabbits, which in places\r\nafford excellent sport. There are but few Mormons in the valley; they\r\nsupply the camp with hay and vegetables, and are said to act as spies.\r\nThe officers can not but remark the coarse features and the animal\r\nexpression of their countenances. On the outskirts of camp are a few\r\nwomen that have taken sanctuary among the Gentiles, who here muster\r\ntoo strong for the Saints. The principal amusement seemed to be that\r\nof walking into and out of the sutlers’ stores, the hospitable Messrs.\r\nGilbert’s and Livingston’s--a _passe temps_ which I have seen at\r\n“Sukkur Bukkur Rohri”--and in an evening ride, dull, monotonous, and\r\nmelancholy, as if we were in the vicinity of Hyderabad, Sindh.\r\n\r\nI had often heard of a local lion, the Timpanogos Kanyon, and my\r\nfriends Captains Heth and Gove had obligingly offered to show me its\r\ncuriosities. After breakfast on the 23d of September--a bright warm\r\nday--we set out in a good ambulance, well provided with the materials\r\nof a two days’ picnic, behind a fine team of four mules, on the road\r\nleading to the Utah Lake. After passing Simple Joe’s dug-out we sighted\r\nthe water once more; it was of a whitish-blue, like the milky waves of\r\nJordan, embosomed in the embrace of tall and bald-headed hills and\r\nmountains, whose monarch was Nebo of the jagged cone. Where the wind\r\ncurrent sets there are patches of white sand strewn with broken shells\r\nand dried water-weed. Near Pelican Point, a long, projecting rocky\r\nspit, there is a fine feeding-ground for geese and ducks, and swimmers\r\nand divers may always be seen dotting the surface. On the south rises a\r\nconspicuous buttress of black rock, and thirty miles off we could see\r\nenormous dust columns careering over the plain. The western part of\r\nthe valley, cut with suncracks and nullahs, and dotted with boulders,\r\nshelves gradually upward from the selvage of the lake to small divides\r\nand dwarf-hill ranges, black with cedar-bush, and traversed only by\r\nwood roads. On the east is the best wheat country in this part of the\r\nTerritory; it is said to produce 106 bushels per acre.\r\n\r\n[JORDAN BRIDGE.]\r\n\r\nAfter seventeen miles we crossed Jordan Bridge, another rickety affair,\r\nfor which, being Mormon property, we paid 50 cents; had we been Saints\r\nthe expense would have been one half. Two more miles led us to Lehi, a\r\nrough miniature of Great Salt Lake City, in which the only decent house\r\nwas the bishop’s; in British India it would have been the collector\r\nand magistrate’s. My companions pointed out to me a hut in which\r\nan apostate Mormon’s throat had been cut by blackened faces. It is\r\ngratifying to observe that throughout the United States, as in the Old\r\nCountry, all historical interest pales before a barbarous murder. As we\r\nadvanced a wall of rock lay before us; the strata were in confusion as\r\nif a convulsion had lately shuddered through their frame, and tumbled\r\nfragments cumbered the base, running up by precipitous ascents to the\r\nmiddle heights. The colors were as grotesque: the foreground was a mass\r\nof emerald cane, high and bushy; beyond it, the near distance was pink\r\nwith the beautiful bloom most unpoetically termed “hogweed,” and azure\r\nwith a growth like the celebrated blue-grass of Kentucky; while the\r\nwall itself was a bloodstone dark green with cedar--which, 100 feet\r\ntall, was dwarfed to an inch--and red stained with autumnal maple, and\r\nbelow and around the brightest yellow of the faded willow formed the\r\nbezel, a golden rim.\r\n\r\n[AMERICAN FORK.]\r\n\r\nTwo miles and a half from Lehi led us to American Fork, a soft sweet\r\nspring of snow-water, with dark shells adhering to white stones, and\r\na quantity of trout swimming the limpid wave. The bridge was rickety\r\nand loose planked--in fact, the worst I ever saw in the United States,\r\nwhere, as a rule, the country bridges can never be crossed without\r\nfear and trembling; the moderate toll was $1 both ways. Three miles\r\nand a half more placed us at Battle Creek, where in 1853 the Yuta\r\nIndians fled precipitately from a Mormon charge. Six miles over a\r\ndusty beach conducted us to the mouth of the kanyon, a brown tract\r\ncrossed by a dusty road and many a spring, and showing the base of\r\nthe opposite wall encumbered with degraded masses, superimposed upon\r\nwhich were miniature castles. The mouth of the ravine was a romantic\r\nspot: the staples were sister giants of brown rock--here sheer, their\r\nsloping--where pines and firs found a precarious root-hold, and ranged\r\nin long perspective lines, while between them, through its channel,\r\nverdant with willow, and over a clear pebbly bed, under the screes and\r\nscaurs, coursed a mountain torrent more splendid than Ruknabad.\r\n\r\nWe forded the torrent and pursued the road, now hugging the right, then\r\nthe left side of the chasm. The latter was exceedingly beautiful, misty\r\nwith the blue of heaven, and rising till its solidity was blent with\r\nthe tenuity of ether. The rest of the scenery was that of the great\r\nCotton-wood Kanyon; painting might express the difference, language can\r\nnot. After six miles of a narrow winding road, we reached the place of\r\nCataracts, the principal lion of the place, and found that the season\r\nhad reduced them to two thin milky lines coursing down bitumen-colored\r\nslopes of bare rock, bordered by shaggy forests of firs and cedars. The\r\nshrinking of the water’s volume lay bare the formation of the cascades,\r\ntwo steps and a slope, which at a happier time would have been veiled\r\nby a continuous sheet of foam.\r\n\r\nAfter finding a suitable spot we outspanned, and, while recruiting\r\nexhausted nature, allowed our mules to roll and rest. After dining\r\nand collecting a few shells, we remounted and drove back through a\r\nmagnificent sunset to American Fork, where the bishop, Mr. Lysander\r\nDayton, of Ohio, had offered us bed and board. The good episkopos\r\nwas of course a Mormon, as we could see by his two pretty wives; he\r\nsupplied us with an excellent supper as a host, not as an innkeeper.\r\nThe little settlement was Great Salt Lake City on a small scale--full\r\nof the fair sex; every one, by-the-by, appeared to be, or about to be,\r\na mother. Fair, but, alas! not fair to us; it was verily\r\n\r\n    “Water, water every where,\r\n      And not a drop to drink!”\r\n\r\n[THE OLD “DANITE.”]\r\n\r\nBefore setting out homeward on the next day we met O. Porter Rockwell,\r\nand took him to the house with us. This old Mormon, in days gone by,\r\nsuffered or did not suffer imprisonment for shooting or not shooting\r\nGovernor Boggs, of Missouri: he now herds cattle for Messrs. Russell\r\nand Co. His tastes are apparently rural; his enemies declare that\r\nhis life would not be safe in the City of the Saints. An attempt had\r\nlately been made to assassinate him in one of the kanyons, and the\r\nfirst report that reached my ears when _en route_ to California was\r\nthe murder of the old Danite by a certain Mr. Marony. He is one of\r\nthe triumvirate, the First Presidency of “executives,” the two others\r\nbeing Ephe Hanks and Bill Hickman--whose names were loud in the land;\r\nthey are now, however, going down; middle age has rendered them\r\ncomparatively inactive, and the rising generation, Lot Huntington,\r\nIke Clawson, and other desperadoes, whose teeth and claws are full\r\ngrown, are able and willing to stand in their stead. Peter Rockwell\r\nwas a man about fifty, tall and strong, with ample leather leggins\r\noverhanging his huge spurs, and the saw-handles of two revolvers\r\npeeping from his blouse. His forehead was already a little bald, and\r\nhe wore his long grizzly locks after the ancient fashion of the United\r\nStates, plaited and gathered up at the nape of the neck; his brow,\r\npuckered with frowning wrinkles, contrasted curiously with his cool,\r\ndetermined gray eye, jolly red face, well touched up with “paint,”\r\nand his laughing, good-humored mouth. He had the manner of a jovial,\r\nreckless, devil-may-care English ruffian. The officers called him\r\nPorter, and preferred him to the “slimy villains” who will drink with\r\na man and then murder him. After a little preliminary business about\r\na stolen horse, all conducted on the amiable, he pulled out a dollar,\r\nand sent to the neighboring distillery for a bottle of Valley Tan. The\r\n_aguardiente_ was smuggled in under a cloth, as though we had been\r\nrespectables in a Moslem country, and we were asked to join him in a\r\n“squar’ drink,” which means spirits without water. The mode of drinking\r\nwas peculiar. Porter, after the preliminary sputation, raised the\r\nglass with cocked little finger to his lips, with a twinkle of the eye\r\nejaculated “Wheat!” that is to say, “good,” and drained the tumbler\r\nto the bottom: we acknowledged his civility with a “here’s how,” and\r\ndrank Kentucky-fashion, which in English is midshipman’s grog. Of these\r\n“squar’ drinks” we had at least four, which, however, did not shake\r\nMr. Rockwell’s nerve, and then he sent out for more. Meanwhile he told\r\nus his last adventure--how, when ascending the kanyon, he suddenly\r\nfound himself covered by two long rifles; how he had thrown himself\r\nfrom his horse, drawn his revolver, and crept behind a bush, and how\r\nhe had dared the enemy to come out and fight like men. He spoke of\r\none Obry, a Frenchman, lately killed in a street-quarrel, who rode on\r\nbusiness from Santa Fé to Independence, about 600 miles, in 110 hours.\r\nPorter offered, for the fun of the thing, to excel him by getting over\r\n900 in 144. When he heard that I was preparing for California, he\r\ngave me abundant good advice--to carry a double-barreled gun loaded\r\nwith buck-shot; to “keep my eyes skinned,” especially in kanyons and\r\nravines; to make at times a dark camp--that is to say, unhitching for\r\nsupper, and then hitching up and turning a few miles off the road;\r\never to be ready for attack when the animals were being inspanned and\r\noutspanned, and never to trust to appearances in an Indian country,\r\nwhere the red varmint will follow a man for weeks, perhaps peering\r\nthrough a wisp of grass on a hill-top till the time arrives for\r\nstriking the blow. I observed that, when thus speaking, Porter’s eyes\r\nassumed the expression of an old mountaineer’s, ever rolling as if\r\nset in quicksilver. For the purpose of avoiding “White Indians,” the\r\nworst of their kind, he advised me to shun the direct route, which he\r\nrepresented to be about as fit for traveling as is h--ll for a powder\r\nmagazine, and to journey _viâ_ Fillmore and the wonder-bearing White\r\nMountains;[225] finally, he comforted me with an assurance that either\r\nthe Indians would not attempt to attack us and our stock--ever a sore\r\ntemptation to them--or that they would assault us in force and “wipe us\r\nout.”\r\n\r\n  [225] An emigrant company lately followed this road, and when obliged\r\n  by the death of their cattle to abandon their kit, they found on the\r\n  tramp a lump of virgin silver, which was carried to California: an\r\n  exploring party afterward dispatched failed, however, to make the\r\n  lead. At the western extremity of the White Mountains there is a\r\n  mammoth cave, of which one mile has been explored: it is said to end\r\n  in a precipice, and the enterprising Major Egan is eager to trace its\r\n  course.\r\n\r\nWhen the drinking was finished we exchanged a cordial _poignée de main_\r\nwith Porter and our hospitable host, who appeared to be the _crême de\r\nla crême_ of Utah County, and soon found ourselves again without the\r\nlimits of Camp Floyd.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 25th of September, the judge, accompanied by his\r\nson and the Marshal of the Territory, entered the cantonment, and our\r\ndeparture was fixed for the next day. The morning of the start was\r\nspent in exchanging adieux and little gifts with men who had now become\r\nfriends, and in stirrup-cups which succeeded one another at no longer\r\nintervals than quarter hours. Judge Crosby, who had arrived by the last\r\nmail, kindly provided me with fishing-tackle which could relieve a diet\r\nof eggs and bacon, and made me regret that I had not added to my outfit\r\na Maynard. This, the best of breech-loading guns, can also be loaded at\r\nthe muzzle; a mere carbine in size, it kills at 1300 yards, and in the\r\nUnited States costs only $40 = £8. The judge, a remarkable contrast to\r\nthe usual Elijah Pogram style that still affects bird’s-eye or speckled\r\nwhite tie, black satin waistcoat, and swallow-tailed coat of rusty\r\nbroadcloth, with terminations to match, had been employed for some time\r\nin Oregon and at St. Juan: he knew one of my expatriated friends--poor\r\nJ. de C., whose exile we all lament--and he gave me introductions which\r\nI found most useful in Carson Valley. Like the best Americans, he spoke\r\nof the English as brothers, and freely owned the deficiencies of his\r\ngovernment, especially in dealing with the frontier Indians.\r\n\r\nWe started from Lieutenant Dudley’s hospitable quarters, where a crowd\r\nhad collected to bid us farewell. The ambulance, with four mules\r\ndriven by Mr. Kennedy in person, stood at the door, and the parting\r\nstirrup-cup was exhibited with a will. I bade farewell with a true\r\nregret to my kind and gallant hosts, whose brotherly attentions had\r\nmade even wretched Camp Floyd a pleasant _séjour_ to me. At the moment\r\nI write it is probably desolate, the “Secession” disturbances having\r\nnecessitated the withdrawal of the unhappies from Utah Territory.\r\n\r\n[JOHNSTON’S SETTLEMENT.]\r\n\r\nAbout 4 P.M., as we mounted, a furious dust-storm broke over the plain;\r\nperhaps it may account for our night’s _méprise_, which a censorious\r\nreader might attribute to our copious libations of whisky. The road\r\nto the first mail station, “Meadow Creek,” lay over a sage barren; we\r\nlost no time in missing it by forging to the west. After hopelessly\r\ndriving about the country till 10 P.M. in the fine cool night, we\r\nknocked at a hut, and induced the owner to appear. He was a Dane who\r\nspoke but little English, and his son, “skeert” by our fierceness,\r\nbegan at once to boo-hoo. At last, however, we were guided by our\r\n“foreloper” to “Johnston’s settlement,” in Rock Valley, and we entered\r\nby the unceremonious process of pulling down the zigzag fences. After\r\nsome trouble we persuaded a Mormon to quit the bed in which his wife\r\nand children lay, to shake down for us sleeping-places among the cats\r\nand hens on the floor, and to provide our animals with oats and hay.\r\nMr. Grice, the marshal, one of the handiest of men, who during his\r\nvolunteer service in Mexico had learned most things from carrying a\r\nmusket to cooking a steak, was kind enough to prepare our supper, after\r\nwhich, still sorely laden with whisky dying within us, we turned in.\r\n\r\n[A MEAN PLACE.]\r\n\r\n  _To Meadow Creek. 27th September._\r\n\r\nWe rose with the dawn, the cats, and the hens, sleep being impossible\r\nafter the first blush of light, and I proceeded to inspect the\r\nsettlement. It is built upon the crest of an earth-wave rising from\r\ngrassy hollows; the haystacks told of stock, and the bunch-grass on the\r\nborders of the ravines and nullahs rendered the place particularly fit\r\nfor pasturage. The land is too cold for cereals: in its bleak bottoms\r\nfrost reigns throughout the year; and there is little bench-ground.\r\nThe settlement consisted of half a dozen huts, which swarmed, however,\r\nwith women and children. Mr. Kennedy introduced us to a Scotch widow\r\nof mature years, who gave us any amount of butter and buttermilk in\r\nexchange for a little tea. She was but a lukewarm Mormon, declaring\r\npolygamy to be an abomination, complaining that she had been inveigled\r\nto a mean place, and that the poor in Mormondom were exceedingly poor.\r\nYet the canny body was stout and fresh, her house was clean and neat,\r\nand she washed her children and her potatoes.\r\n\r\nWe had wandered twenty-five miles out of the right road, and were\r\nstill distant fifteen to sixteen from the first mail station. For the\r\nuse of the floor, flies, and permission to boil water, we paid our\r\ntaciturn Mormon $2, and at noon, a little before the bursting of the\r\ndusty storm-gusts, which reproduced the horrors of Sindh, we found\r\nourselves once more in the saddle and the ambulance. We passed by a\r\ncattle track on rolling ground dotted with sage and greasewood, which\r\nsheltered hosts of jackass-rabbits, and the sego with its beautiful\r\nlily-like flowers. After crossing sundry nullahs and pitch-holes with\r\ndeep and rugged sides, we made the mail station at the west end of\r\nRush Valley, which is about twenty miles distant from Camp Floyd. The\r\nlittle green bottom, with its rush-bordered sinking spring, is called\r\nby Captain Simpson “Meadow Creek.” We passed a pleasant day in revolver\r\npractice with Al. Huntington, the renowned brother of Lot, who had\r\nlately bolted to South California, in attempts at rabbit-shooting--the\r\nbeasts became very wild in the evening--and in dining on an antelope\r\nwhich a youth had ridden down and pistoled. With the assistance of the\r\nstation-master, Mr. Faust, a civil and communicative man, who added\r\na knowledge of books and drugs to the local history, I compiled an\r\naccount of the several lines of communication between Great Salt Lake\r\nCity and California.\r\n\r\nThree main roads connect the land of the Saints with the El Dorado of\r\nthe West--the northern, the central, and the southern.\r\n\r\nThe northern road rounds the upper end of the Great Salt Lake, and\r\nfalls into the valleys of the Humboldt and Carson Rivers. It was\r\nexplored in 1845 by Colonel Frémont,[226] who, when passing over the\r\nseventy waterless miles of the western, a continuation of the eastern\r\ndesert, lost ten mules and several horses. The “first overland trip”\r\nwas followed in 1846 by a party of emigrants under a Mr. Hastings,\r\nwho gave his name to the “cut-off” which has materially shortened the\r\ndistance. The road has been carefully described in Kelly’s California,\r\nin Horn’s “Overland Guide,” and by M. Remy. It is still, despite its\r\nlength, preferred by travelers, on account of the abundance of grass\r\nand water: moreover, there are now but two short stretches of desert.\r\n\r\n  [226] Explored is used in a modified sense. Every foot of ground\r\n  passed over by Colonel Frémont was perfectly well known to the old\r\n  trappers and traders, as the interior of Africa to the Arab and\r\n  Portuguese pombeiros. But this fact takes nothing away from the\r\n  honors of the man who first surveyed and scientifically observed\r\n  the country. Among those who preceded Colonel Frémont, the most\r\n  remarkable, perhaps, was Sylvester Pattie, a Virginian, who, having\r\n  lost his wife in his adopted home on the Missouri, resolved to trap\r\n  upon and to trace out the head-waters of the Yellow River. The little\r\n  company of five persons, among whom were Pattie and his son, set out\r\n  on the 20th of June, 1824, and on the 22d of August arrived at the\r\n  head-waters of the Platte, where they found General Pratt proceeding\r\n  toward Santa Fé. Pattie, in command of 116 men, crossed the dividing\r\n  ridge, descended into the valley of the Rio Grand del Norto, entered\r\n  Santa Fé, and trapped on the Gila River. The party broke up on the\r\n  27th of November, 1826, when Pattie, accompanied by his son and six\r\n  others, descended the Colorado, and, after incredible hardships,\r\n  reached the Hispano-American missions, where they were received\r\n  with the customary inhumanity. The father died in durance vile; the\r\n  son, after being released and vaccinated at San Diego, reached San\r\n  Francisco, whence he returned home _viâ_ Vera Cruz and New Orleans,\r\n  after an absence of six years. The whole tale is well told in\r\n  “Harper’s Magazine.”\r\n\r\n[PIONEER EXPLORERS.]\r\n\r\nThe southern road, _viâ_ Fillmore and San Bernardino, to San Pedro,\r\nwhere the traveler can embark for San Francisco, is long and tedious;\r\nwater is found at thirty-mile distances; there are three deserts; and\r\nbunch and other grasses are not plentiful. It has one great merit,\r\nnamely, that of being rarely snowed up, except between the Rio Virgen\r\nand Great Salt Lake City: the best traveling is in Spring, when the\r\nmelting snows from the eastern hills fill the rivulets. This route\r\nhas been traveled over by Messrs. Chandless and Remy, who have well\r\ndescribed it in their picturesque pages. I add a few notes, collected\r\nfrom men who have ridden over the ground for several years, concerning\r\nthe stations: the information, however, it will be observed, is merely\r\nhearsay.[227]\r\n\r\n  [227] The distance from Great Salt Lake City to San Bernardino is,\r\n  according to my informant, about 750 miles, and has been accomplished\r\n  in fourteen days. The road runs through Provo to Salt Cruz, formed by\r\n  a desert of 50-60 miles, and making Sevier River the half-way point\r\n  to the capital. At Corn Creek is an Indian farm, and Weaver is 64\r\n  miles from Fillmore. Cedar Spring is the entrance to Paravan Valley,\r\n  where as early as 1806 there was a fort and a settlement. Then comes\r\n  Fillmore, the territorial capital, and 96 miles afterward it passes\r\n  through Paravan City in Little Salt Lake Valley. At Cold Creek it\r\n  forks, the central road being that mostly preferred. The next station\r\n  is Mountain Meadows, the Southern Rim of the Basin, celebrated for\r\n  its massacre; ensues the Santa Clara River, and thence a total of 70\r\n  miles, divided into several stages, lead to the Rio Virgen. After\r\n  following the latter for 20-30 miles, the path crosses the divide\r\n  of Muddy River, and enters a desert 55-67 miles in breadth leading\r\n  to Las Vegas. Thirty miles beyond that point lies a pretty water\r\n  called “Mountain Springs,” a preliminary to “Dry Lake,” a second\r\n  desert 40-45 miles broad, and ending at an alkaline water called\r\n  Kingston Springs. The third desert, 40 miles broad, leads to a post\r\n  established for the protection of emigrants, and called Bitter or\r\n  Bidder’s Springs, 115 miles from Las Vegas. The next stage of 35 is\r\n  to the Indian River, a tributary of the Colorado, whence there is\r\n  another military establishment: the land is now Californian. Thence\r\n  following and crossing the course of the stream, the traveler sights\r\n  the Sierra Nevada. After 50 miles down the Mohave Kanyon is San\r\n  Bernardino, once a thriving Mormon settlement, 90 miles from San\r\n  Pedro and 120 from San Diego, where water conveyance is found to San\r\n  Francisco.\r\n\r\nThe central route is called Egan’s by the Mormons, Simpson’s by the\r\nGentiles. Mr. or Major Howard Egan is a Saint and well-known guide, an\r\nindefatigable mountaineer, who for some time drove stock to California\r\nin the employ of Messrs. Livingston, and who afterward became\r\nmail-agent under Messrs. Chorpenning and Russell. On one occasion he\r\nmade the distance in twelve days, and he claims to have explored the\r\npresent post-office route between 1850 and the winter of 1857-1858.\r\nCaptain J. H. Simpson, of the federal army, whose itinerary is given\r\nin Appendix I., followed between May and June, 1859. He traveled along\r\nEgan’s path, with a few unimportant deviations, for 300 miles, and\r\nleft it ten miles west of Ruby Valley, trending southward to the suite\r\nof the Carson River. On his return he pursued a more southerly line,\r\nand fell into Egan’s route about thirty miles west of Camp Floyd. The\r\n_employés_ of the route prefer Egan’s line, declaring that on Simpson’s\r\nthere is little grass, that the springs are mere fiumaras of melted\r\nsnow, and that the wells are waterless. Bad, however, is the best, as\r\nthe following pages will, I think, prove.\r\n\r\n  _To Tophet. 28th September._\r\n\r\nOn a cool and cloudy morning, which at 10 A.M. changed into a clear\r\nsunny day, we set out, after paying $3 for three feeds, to make the\r\nsecond station. Our road lay over the seven miles of plain that\r\nended Rush Valley: we saw few rabbits, and the sole vegetation was\r\nstunted sage. Ensued a rough divide, stony and dusty, with cahues\r\nand pitch-holes: it is known by the name of General Johnston’s\r\nPass. The hills above it are gray and bald-headed, a few bristles\r\nof black cedar protruding from their breasts, and the land wears an\r\nuninhabitable look. After two miles of toil we halted near the ruins\r\nof an old station. On the right side of the road was a spring half way\r\nup the hill: three holes lay full of slightly alkaline water, and the\r\nsurplus flowed off in a black bed of vegetable mud, which is often\r\ndry in spring and summer. At “Point Look-out,” near the counterslope\r\nof the divide, we left on the south Simpson’s route, and learned by a\r\nsign-post that the distance to Carson is 533 miles. The pass led to\r\nSkull Valley, of ominous sound. According to some, the name is derived\r\nfrom the remains of Indians which are found scattered about a fine\r\nspring in the southern parts. Others declare that the mortal remains\r\nof bison here lie like pavement-stones or cannon balls in the Crimean\r\nValley of Death. Skull Valley stretches nearly southwest of the Great\r\nSalt Lake plain, with which it communicates, and its drainage, as in\r\nthese parts generally, feeds the lake. Passing out of Skull Valley, we\r\ncrossed the cahues and pitch-holes of a broad bench which rose above\r\nthe edge of the desert, and after seventeen miles beyond the Pass\r\nreached the station which Mormons call Egan’s Springs, anti-Mormons\r\nSimpson’s Springs, and Gentiles Lost Springs.\r\n\r\nStanding upon the edge of the bench, I could see the Tophet in prospect\r\nfor us till Carson Valley: a road narrowing in perspective to a point\r\nspanned its grisly length, awfully long, and the next mail station\r\nhad shrunk to a little black knob. All was desert: the bottom could\r\nno longer be called basin or valley: it was a thin fine silt, thirsty\r\ndust in the dry season, and putty-like mud in the spring and autumnal\r\nrains. The hair of this unlovely skin was sage and greasewood: it was\r\nwarted with sand-heaps; in places mottled with bald and horrid patches\r\nof salt soil, while in others minute crystals of salt, glistening\r\nlike diamond-dust in the sunlight, covered tracts of moist and oozy\r\nmud. Before us, but a little to the right or north, and nearly due\r\nwest of Camp Floyd, rose Granite Mountain, a rough and jagged spine\r\nor hog’s-back, inhabited only by wolves and antelopes, hares and\r\nsquirrels, grasshoppers, and occasionally an Indian family. Small sweet\r\nsprings are found near its northern and southern points. The tradition\r\nof the country declares it to be rich in gold, which, however, no\r\none dares to dig. Our road is about to round the southern extremity,\r\nwheeling successively S. and S.E., then W. and N.W., then S.W. and\r\nS.E., and S.W. and N.W.--in fact, round three quarters of the compass;\r\nand for three mortal days we shall sight its ugly frowning form. A\r\ndirect passage leads between it and the corresponding point of the\r\nsouthern hill: we contemplate, through the gap, a blue ridge where lies\r\nWillow-Spring Station, the destination of our party after to-morrow;\r\nbut the straight line which saves so much distance is closed by bogs\r\nfor the greater part of the year, and the size of the wild sage would\r\nimpede our wagon-wheels.\r\n\r\n[THE GREAT DESERT.]\r\n\r\nThe great desert of Utah Territory extends in length about 300 miles\r\nalong the western side of the Great Salt Lake. Its breadth varies: a\r\nlittle farther south it can not be crossed, the water, even where not\r\npoisonous, being insufficient. The formation is of bottoms like that\r\ndescribed above, bench-lands, with the usual parallel and perfectly\r\nhorizontal water-lines, leaving regular steps, as the sea settled down,\r\nby the gradual upheaval of the land. They mark its former elevation\r\nupon the sides of the many detached ridges trending mostly N. and S.\r\nLike the rim of the Basin, these hills are not a single continuous\r\nmountain range which might be flanked, but a series of disconnected\r\nprotrusions above the general level of the land. A paying railway\r\nthrough this country is as likely as a profitable canal through the\r\nIsthmus of Suez: the obstacles must be struck at right angles, with\r\nsuch assistance as the rough kanyons and the ravines of various levels\r\nafford.\r\n\r\nWe are now in a country dangerous to stock. It is a kind of central\r\npoint, where Pávant, Gosh Yuta (popularly called Gosh Ute), and Panak\r\n(Bannacks) meet. Watches, therefore, were told off for the night.\r\nNext morning, however, it was found that all had stood on guard with\r\nunloaded guns.\r\n\r\n  _To Fish Springs. 29th September._\r\n\r\n[OUR PARTY.]\r\n\r\nAt Lost Springs the party was mustered. The following was found to\r\nbe the material. The Ras Kafilah was one Kennedy, an Irishman, whose\r\nbrogue, doubly Dublin, sounded startlingly in the Great American\r\nDesert. On a late trip he had been victimized by Indians. The savages\r\nhad driven off two of his horses into a kanyon within sight of the\r\nDeep-Creek Station. In the hurry of pursuit he spurred up the ravine,\r\nfollowed by a friend, when, sighting jerked meat, his own property,\r\nupon the trees, he gave the word _sauve qui peut_. As they whirled\r\ntheir horses the Yutas rushed down the hill to intercept them at the\r\nmouth of the gorge, calling them in a loud voice dogs and squaws, and\r\nfiring sundry shots, which killed Kennedy’s horse and pierced his right\r\narm. Most men, though they jest at scars before feeling a wound, are\r\ntemporarily cowed by an infliction of the kind, and of that order was\r\nthe good Kennedy.\r\n\r\nThe next was an excellent traveler, by name Howard. On the road between\r\nGreat Salt Lake City and Camp Floyd I saw two men, who addressed me as\r\nMr. Kennedy the boss, and, finding out their mistake, followed us to\r\nthe place of rendezvous. The party, with one eye gray and the other\r\nblack, mounted upon a miserable pony, was an American. After a spell at\r\nthe gold diggings of California he had revisited the States, and he now\r\nwished to return to his adopted country without loss of time. He was a\r\nhardy, fine-tempered fellow, exceedingly skilled in driving stock. His\r\ncompanion was a Frenchman and ex-Zouave, who, for reasons best known\r\nto himself, declared that he came from Cuba, and that he had forgotten\r\nevery word of Spanish. Like foreigners among Anglo-Scandinavians\r\ngenerally, the poor devil fared badly. He could not hold his own. With\r\nthe most labor, he had the worst of every thing. He felt himself _mal\r\nplacé_, and before the end of the journey he slunk away.\r\n\r\nAt Lost Springs we were joined by two Mormon fugitives, “pilgrims of\r\nlove,” who had, it was said, secretly left the city at night, fearing\r\nthe consequences of having “loved not wisely, but too well.” The first\r\nof the Lotharios was a Mr. R----, an English farrier-blacksmith,\r\nmounted upon an excellent horse and leading another. He soon took\r\noffense at our slow rate of progress, and, afflicted by the thought\r\nthat the avenger was behind him, left us at Deep Creek, and “made\r\ntracks” to Carson City in ten days, with two horses and a total\r\ntraveling kit of two blankets. We traced him to California by the\r\ntrail of falsehoods which he left on the road. His comrade, Mr. A----,\r\na New Englander, was also an apostate Mormon, a youth of good family\r\nand liberal education, who, after ruining himself by city sites and\r\ncopper mines on Lake Superior, had permanently compromised himself\r\nwith society by becoming a Saint. Also a Lothario, he had made his\r\nescape, and he proved himself a good and useful member of society. I\r\ncould not but admire the acuteness of both these youths, who, flying\r\nfrom justice, had placed themselves under the protection of a judge.\r\nThey reminded me of a debtor friend who found himself secure from the\r\nbailiff only within the walls of Spike Island or Belvidere Place,\r\nSouthwark.\r\n\r\nAnother notable of the party was an apostate Jew and _soi disant_\r\napostate Mormon who answered to the name of Rose. He had served as\r\nmissionary in the Sandwich Islands, and he spoke Kanaka like English.\r\nHis features were those which Mr. Thackeray loves to delineate;\r\nhis accents those which Robson delights to imitate. He denied his\r\nconnection with the Hebrews. He proved it by eating more, by driving\r\na better bargain, by doing less work than any of the party. It was\r\ntruly refreshing to meet this son of old Houndsditch in the land of\r\nthe Saints, under the shadow of New Zion, and the only drawback to our\r\nenjoyment was the general suspicion that the honorable name of apostate\r\ncovered the less respectable calling of spy. He contrasted strongly\r\nwith Jim Gilston of Illinois, a lath-like specimen of humanity,\r\nsome six feet four in length--a perfect specimen of the Indianized\r\nwhite, long hair, sun-tanned, and hatchet-faced; running like an\r\nostrich, yelping like a savage, and ready to take scalp at the first\r\nprovocation. He could not refrain, as the end of the journey drew\r\nnigh, from deserting without paying his passage. Mr. Colville, a most\r\ndetermined Yankee, far advanced in years, was equally remarkable.\r\nHe had $90 in his pocket. He shivered for want of a blanket, and he\r\nlived on hard bread, bacon, and tea, of which no man was ever seen to\r\npartake. Such were the seven “free men,” the independent traders of the\r\ncompany. There were also six “broths of boys,” who paid small sums up\r\nto $40 for the benefit of our escort, and who were expected to drive\r\nand to do general work. Traveling soon makes friends. No illusions of\r\n_amicitia_, however, could blind my eyes to the danger of entering an\r\nIndian country with such an escort. Untried men for the most part, they\r\nwould have discharged their weapons in the air and fled at the whoop\r\nof an Indian, all of them, including Jake the Shoshonee, who had been\r\npermitted to accompany us as guide, and excepting our stanch ones,\r\nHoward, “Billy” the colt, and “Brandy” the dog.\r\n\r\n[“GENTLE ANNIE.”--“YOU _BET_.”]\r\n\r\nThe station was thrown somewhat into confusion by the presence of a\r\npetticoat, an article which in these regions never fails to attract\r\npresents of revolvers and sides of bacon. “Gentle Annie,” attended by\r\nthree followers, was passing in an ambulance from California to Denver\r\nCity, where her “friend” was. To most of my companions’ inquiries about\r\nold acquaintances in California, she replied, in Western phrase, that\r\nthe individual subject of their solicitude had “got to git up and git,”\r\nwhich means that he had found change of air and scene advisable. Most\r\nof her sentences ended with a “you _bet_,” even under circumstances\r\nwhere such operation would have been quite uncalled for. So it is\r\nrelated that when Dr. P----, of Camp Floyd, was attending Mrs. A. B. C.\r\nat a most critical time, he asked her tenderly, “Do you suffer much,\r\nMrs. C.?” to which the new matron replied, “You _bet_!”\r\n\r\nWe set out about noon, on a day hot as midsummer by contrast with the\r\npreceding nights, for a long spell of nearly fifty miles. Shortly\r\nafter leaving the station the road forks. The left-hand path leads to\r\na grassy spring in a dwarf kanyon near the southern or upper part of a\r\nriver bottom, where emigrants are fond of camping. The hills scattered\r\naround the basin were of a dark metallic stone, sunburnt to chocolate.\r\nThe strata were highly tilted up and the water-lines distinctly drawn.\r\nAfter eight miles we descended into the yellow silty bed of a bald\r\nand barren fiumara, which was not less than a mile broad. The good\r\njudge sighed when he contrasted it with Monongahela, the “river of the\r\nfalling banks.” It flows northward, and sinks near the western edge of\r\nthe lake. At times it runs three feet of water. The hills around are\r\nwhite-capped throughout the winter, but snow seldom lies more than a\r\nweek in the bottoms.\r\n\r\nAfter twenty miles over the barren plain we reached, about sunset,\r\nthe station at the foot of the Dugway. It was a mere “dug-out”--a\r\nhole four feet deep, roofed over with split cedar trunks, and\r\nprovided with a rude adobe chimney. The tenants were two rough young\r\nfellows--station-master and express rider--with their friend, an\r\nEnglish bull-dog. One of them had amused himself by decorating the\r\nsides of the habitation with niches and Egyptian heads. Rude art seems\r\ninstinctively to take that form which it wears on the banks of Nilus,\r\nand should some Professor Rafinesque discover these traces of the\r\naborigines after a sepulture of a century, they will furnish materials\r\nfor a rich chapter on ante-Columbian immigration. Water is brought to\r\nthe station in casks. The youths believe that some seven miles north of\r\nthe “Dugway” there is a spring, which the Indians, after the fashion of\r\nthat folk, sensibly conceal from the whites. Three wells have been sunk\r\nnear the station. Two soon led to rock; the third has descended 120\r\nfeet, but is still bone dry. It passes first through a layer of surface\r\nsilt, then through three or four feet of loose, friable, fossilless,\r\nchalky lime, which, when slaked, softened, and, mixed with sand, is\r\nused as mortar. The lowest strata are of quartz gravel, forming in the\r\ndeeper parts a hard conglomerate. The workmen complained greatly of the\r\nincreasing heat as they descend. Gold now becomes uppermost in man’s\r\nmind. The youths, seeing me handle the rubbish, at once asked me if I\r\nwas prospecting for gold.\r\n\r\nAfter roughly supping we set out, with a fine round moon high in the\r\nskies, to ascend the “Dugway Pass” by a rough dusty road winding\r\nround the shoulder of a hill, through which a fiumara has burst its\r\nway. Like other Utah mountains, the highest third rises suddenly\r\nfrom a comparatively gradual incline, a sore formation for cattle,\r\nrequiring draught to be at least doubled. Arriving on the summit, we\r\nsat down, while our mules returned to help the baggage-wagons, and\r\namused ourselves with the strange aspect of the scene. To the north, or\r\nbefore us, and far below, lay a long broad stretch, white as snow--the\r\nSaleratus Desert, west of the Great Salt Lake. It wore a grisly aspect\r\nin the silvery light of the moon. Behind us was the brown plain,\r\nsparsely dotted with shadows, and dewless in the evening as in the\r\nmorning. As the party ascended the summit with much noisy shouting,\r\nthey formed a picturesque group--the well-bred horses wandering to\r\ngraze, the white-tilted wagons with their panting mules, and the men\r\nin felt capotes and huge leather leggins. In honor of our good star\r\nwhich had preserved every hoof from accident, we “liquored up” on that\r\nsummit, and then began the descent.\r\n\r\n[THE DEVIL’S HOLE.]\r\n\r\nHaving reached the plain, the road ran for eight miles over a broken\r\nsurface, with severe pitch-holes and wagon-tracks which have lasted\r\nmany a month; it then forked. The left, which is about six miles the\r\nlonger of the two, must be taken after rains, and leads to the Devil’s\r\nHole, a curious formation in a bench under “High Mountain,” about\r\nninety miles from Camp Floyd, and south, with a little westing, of the\r\nGreat Salt Lake. The Hole is described as shaped like the frustrum of\r\nan inverted cone, forty feet in diameter above, twelve to fifteen\r\nbelow. As regards the depth, four lariats of forty feet each, and a\r\nline at the end, did not, it is said, reach the bottom. Captain Simpson\r\ndescribes the water as brackish. The drivers declare it to be half\r\nsalt. The Devil’s Hole is popularly supposed to be an air-vent or\r\nshaft communicating with the waters of the Great Salt Lake in their\r\nsubterraneous journey to the sea (Pacific Ocean). An object cast into\r\nit, they say, is sucked down and disappears; hence, if true, probably\r\nthe theory.\r\n\r\n[SLOUGHS.]\r\n\r\nWe chose the shorter cut, and, after eight miles, rounded Mountain\r\nPoint, the end of a dark brown butte falling into the plain. Opposite\r\nus and under the western hills, which were distant about two miles,\r\nlay the station, but we were compelled to double, for twelve miles,\r\nthe intervening slough, which no horse can cross without being mired.\r\nThe road hugged the foot of the hills at the edge of the saleratus\r\nbasin, which looked like a furrowed field in which snow still lingers.\r\nIn places, warts of earth tufted with greasewood emerged from hard,\r\nflaky, curling silt-cakes; in others, the salt frosted out of the damp\r\nblack earth like the miniature sugar-plums upon chocolate bonbons. We\r\nthen fell into a saline resembling freshly-fallen snow. The whiteness\r\nchanges to a slaty blue, like a frozen pond when the water still\r\nunderlies it; and, to make the delusion perfect, the black rutted path\r\nlooked as if lately cut out after a snow-storm. Weird forms appeared in\r\nthe moonlight. A line of sand-heaps became a row of railroad cars; a\r\nraised bench was mistaken for a paling; and the bushes were any thing\r\nbetween a cow and an Indian. This part of the road must be terrible in\r\nwinter; even in the fine season men are often compelled to unpack half\r\na dozen times.\r\n\r\nAfter ascending some sand-hills we halted for the party to form up\r\nin case of accident, and Mr. Kennedy proceeded to inspect while we\r\nprepared for the worst part of the stage--the sloughs. These are three\r\nin number, one of twenty and the two others of 100 yards in length.\r\nThe tule, the bayonet-grass, and the tall rushes enable animals to\r\npass safely over the deep slushy mud, but when the vegetation is well\r\ntrodden down, horses are in danger of being permanently mired. The\r\nprincipal inconvenience to man is the infectious odor of the foul\r\nswamps. Our cattle were mad with thirst; however, they crossed the\r\nthree sloughs successfully, although some had nearly made Dixie’s Land,\r\nin the second.\r\n\r\nBeyond the sloughs we ascended a bench, and traveled on an improved\r\nroad. We passed sundry circular ponds garnished with rush; the water\r\nis sulphury, and, according to the season, is warm, hot, or cold. Some\r\nof these debord, and send forth what the Somal would call Biya Gora,\r\n“night-flowing streams.” About 3 A.M., cramped with cold, we sighted\r\nthe station, and gave the usual “Yep! yep!” A roaring fire soon revived\r\nus; the strong ate supper and the weak went to bed, thus ending a\r\nsomewhat fatiguing day.\r\n\r\n  _To Willow Creek. 30th September._\r\n\r\nOn this line there are two kinds of stations--the mail station, where\r\nthere is an agent in charge of five or six “boys,” and the express\r\nstation--every second--where there is only a master and an express\r\nrider. The boss receives $50-$75 per mensem, the boy $35. It is a\r\nhard life, setting aside the chance of death--no less than three\r\nmurders have been committed by the Indians during this year--the work\r\nis severe; the diet is sometimes reduced to wolf-mutton, or a little\r\nboiled wheat and rye, and the drink to brackish water; a pound of\r\ntea comes occasionally, but the droughty souls are always “out” of\r\nwhisky and tobacco. At “Fish Springs,” where there is little danger of\r\nsavages, two men had charge of the ten horses and mules; one of these\r\nwas a German Swiss from near Schaffhausen, who had been digging for\r\ngold to little purpose in California.\r\n\r\nA clear cool morning succeeding the cold night aroused us betimes.\r\nNature had provided an ample supply of warm water, though slightly\r\nsulphury, in the neighboring pot-holes, and at a little distance\r\nfrom the station was one conveniently cool. The fish from which the\r\nformation derives its name is a perch-like species, easily caught on a\r\ncloudy day. The men, like the citizens of Suez, accustom themselves to\r\nthe “rotten water,” as strangers call it, and hardly relish the purer\r\nsupplies of Simpson’s Springs or Willow Springs: they might have built\r\nthe station about one mile north, near a natural well of good cool\r\nwater, but apparently they prefer the warm bad.\r\n\r\nThe saleratus valley looked more curious in daylight than in moonlight.\r\nThe vegetation was in regular scale; smallest, the rich bunch-grass\r\non the benches; then the greasewood and the artemisia, where the\r\nlatter can grow; and largest of all, the dwarf cedar. All was of\r\nlively hue, the herbage bright red, yellow, and sometimes green, the\r\nshrubs were gray and glaucous, the cedars almost black, and the rim\r\nof hills blue-brown and blue. We had ample time to contemplate these\r\ncuriosities, for Kennedy, whose wits, like those of Hiranyaka, the\r\nmouse, were mightily sharpened by the possession of wealth, had sat up\r\nall night, and wanted a longer sleep in the morning. After a breakfast\r\nwhich the water rendered truly detestable, we hitched up about 10 A.M.,\r\nand set out _en route_ for Willow Springs.\r\n\r\n[THE DESERT VIEW.]\r\n\r\nAbout an hour after our departure we met the party commanded by\r\nLieutenant Weed, two subaltern officers, ninety dragoons, and ten\r\nwagons; they had been in the field since May, and had done good service\r\nagainst the Gosh Yutas. We halted and “liquored up,” and, after\r\nAmerican fashion, talked politics in the wilderness. Half an hour then\r\nled us to what we christened “Kennedy’s Hole,” another circular bowl,\r\ngirt with grass and rush, in the plain under a dark brown rock, with\r\nblack bands and scatters of stone. A short distance beyond, and also on\r\nthe right of the road, lay the “Poison Springs,” in a rushy bed: the\r\nwater was temptingly clear, but the bleached bones of many a quadruped\r\nskeleton bade us beware of it. After turning a point we saw in front a\r\nswamp, the counterpart of what met our eyes last night; it renewed also\r\nthe necessity of rounding it by a long southerly sweep. The scenery was\r\nthat of the Takhashshua near Zayla, or the delicious land behind Aden,\r\nthe Arabian sea-board. Sand-heaps--the only dry spots after rain--fixed\r\nby tufts of metallic green salsolæ, and guarded from the desert wind\r\nby rusty cane-grass, emerged from the wet and oozy plain, in which\r\nthe mules often sank to the fetlock. The unique and snowy floor of\r\nthin nitre, bluish where deliquescent, was here solid as a sheet of\r\nice; there a net-work of little ridges, as if the salt had expanded\r\nby crystallization, with regular furrows worked by rain. After heavy\r\nshowers it becomes a soft, slippery, tenacious, and slushy mud, that\r\nrenders traveling exceeding laborious; the glare is blinding by day,\r\nand at night the refrigerating properties of the salt render the wind\r\nbitterly cold, even when the mercury stands at 50° F.\r\n\r\n[SPORTING.]\r\n\r\nWe halted to bait at the half-way house, the fork of the road leading\r\nto Pleasant Valley, an unpleasant place, so called because discovered\r\non a pleasant evening. As we advanced the land improved, the salt\r\ndisappeared, the grass was splendidly green, and, approaching the\r\nstation, we passed Willow Creek, where gophar-holes and snipes, willows\r\nand wild roses, told of life and gladdened the eye. The station lay\r\non a bench beyond the slope. The express rider was a handsome young\r\nMormon, who wore in his felt hat the effigy of a sword; his wife was\r\nan Englishwoman, who, as usual under the circumstances, had completely\r\nthrown off the Englishwoman. The station-keeper was an Irishman, one\r\nof the few met among the Saints. Nothing could be fouler than the log\r\nhut; the flies soon drove us out of doors; hospitality, however, was\r\nnot wanting, and we sat down to salt beef and bacon, for which we were\r\nnot allowed to pay. The evening was spent in setting a wolf-trap,\r\nwhich consisted of a springy pole and a noose: we strolled about after\r\nsunset with a gun, but failed to bag snipe, wild-fowl, or hare, and\r\nsighted only a few cunning old crows, and black swamp-birds with yellow\r\nthroats. As the hut contained but one room, we slept outside. The Gosh\r\nYuta are apparently not a venturesome people; still, it is considered\r\nadvisable at times to shift one’s sleeping quarters, and to acquire the\r\nhabit of easily awaking.\r\n\r\n  _To Deep Creek and halt. 1st and 2d of October, 1860._\r\n\r\nA “little war” had been waging near Willow Springs. In June the station\r\nwas attacked by a small band of Gosh Yuta, of whom three were shot\r\nand summarily scalped; an energetic proceeding, which had prevented\r\na repetition of the affair. The savages, who are gathering their\r\npine-nut harvest, and are driven by destitution to beg at the stations,\r\nto which one meal a week will attach them, are now comparatively\r\npeaceful: when the emigration season recommences they are expected\r\nto be troublesome, and their numbers--the Pa Yutas can bring 12,000\r\nwarriors into the field--render them formidable. “Jake,” the Shoshonee,\r\nwho had followed us from Lost Springs, still considered his life in\r\ndanger; he was as unwilling to wend his way alone as an Arab Bedouin\r\nor an African negro in their respective interiors. With regard to\r\nourselves, Lieutenant Weed had declared that there was no danger; the\r\nstation people thought, on the contrary, that the snake, which had\r\nbeen scotched, not killed, would recover after the departure of the\r\nsoldiers, and that the work of destruction had not been carried on with\r\nsufficient vigor.\r\n\r\nAt 6 A.M. the thermometer showed 45° F.; we waited two hours, till the\r\nworld had time to warm. After six miles we reached “Mountain Springs,”\r\na water-sink below the bench-land, tufted round with cotton-wood,\r\nwillow, rose, cane, and grass. On our right, or eastward, lay Granite\r\nRock, which we had well-nigh rounded, and through a gap we saw\r\nLost-Springs Station, distant apparently but a few hours’ canter.\r\nBetween us, however, lay the horrible salt plain--a continuation of the\r\nlow lands bounding the western edge of the Great Salt Lake--which the\r\ndrainage of the hills over which we were traveling inundates till June.\r\n\r\nAfter twelve miles over the bench we passed a dark rock, which protects\r\na water called Reading’s Springs, and we halted to form up at the mouth\r\nof Deep-Creek Kanyon. This is a dangerous gorge, some nine miles long,\r\nformed by a water-course which sheds into the valley of the Great Salt\r\nLake. Here I rode forward with “Jim,” a young express rider from the\r\nlast station, who volunteered much information upon the subject of\r\nIndians. He carried two Colt’s revolvers, of the dragoon or largest\r\nsize, considering all others too small. I asked him what he would do if\r\na Gosh Yuta appeared. He replied that if the fellow were civil he might\r\nshake hands with him, if surly he would shoot him; and, at all events,\r\nwhen riding away, that he would keep a “stirrup eye” upon him: that he\r\nwas in the habit of looking round corners to see if any one was taking\r\naim, in which case he would throw himself from the saddle, or rush\r\non, so as to spoil the shooting--the Indians, when charged, becoming\r\nexcited, fire without effect. He mentioned four Red Men who could “draw\r\na bead” against any white; usually, however, they take a minute to\r\nload; they require a long aim, and they stint their powder. He pointed\r\nout a place where Miller, one of the express riders, had lately been\r\nbadly wounded, and lost his horse. Nothing, certainly, could be better\r\nfitted for an ambuscade than this gorge, with its caves and holes in\r\nsnow-cuts, earth-drops, and lines of strata, like walls of rudely-piled\r\nstone; in one place we saw the ashes of an Indian encampment; in\r\nanother, a whirlwind, curling, as smoke would rise, from behind a\r\nprojecting spur, made us advance with the greatest caution.\r\n\r\nAs we progressed the valley opened out, and became too broad to be\r\ndangerous. Near the summit of the pass the land is well lined with\r\nwhite sage, which may be used as fodder, and a dwarf cedar adorns the\r\nhills. The ground gives out a hollow sound, and the existence of a\r\nspring in the vicinity is suspected. Descending the western water-shed,\r\nwe sighted, in Deep-Creek Valley, St. Mary’s County, the first patch of\r\ncultivation since leaving Great Salt Lake. The Indian name is Aybá-pá,\r\nor the Clay-colored Water; pity that America and Australia have not\r\nalways preserved the native local terms. It is bisected by a rivulet\r\nin which three streamlets from the southern hills unite; like these\r\nfeatures generally, its course is northward till it sinks: fields\r\nextend about one mile from each bank, and the rest of the yellow bottom\r\nis a tapestry of wire grass and wheat grass. An Indian model farm\r\nhad been established here; the war, however, prevented cultivation;\r\nthe savages had burned down the house, and several of them had been\r\nkilled by the soldiers. On the west of the valley were white rocks of\r\nthe lime used for mortar: the hills also showed lias and marble-like\r\nlimestones. The eastern wall was a grim line of jagged peaks, here\r\nbare with granite, there black with cedar; they are crossed by a short\r\ncut leading to the last station, which, however, generally proves the\r\nlongest way, and in a dark ravine Kennedy pointed out the spot where he\r\nhad of late nearly left his scalp. Coal is said to be found there in\r\nchunks, and gold is supposed to abound; the people, however, believing\r\nthat the valley can not yet support extensive immigration, conceal it\r\nprobably by “counsel.”\r\n\r\n[DEEP-CREEK STATION.--MR. WADDINGTON.]\r\n\r\nAt 4 P.M. we reached the settlement, consisting of two huts and a\r\nstation-house, a large and respectable-looking building of unburnt\r\nbrick, surrounded by fenced fields, water-courses, and stacks of good\r\nadobe. We were introduced to the Mormon station-master, Mr. Sevier,\r\nand others. They are mostly farm-laborers, who spend the summer here\r\nand supply the road with provisions: in the winter they return to\r\nGrantsville, where their families are settled. Among them was a Mr.\r\nWaddington, an old Pennsylvanian and a bigoted Mormon. It is related\r\nof him that he had treasonably saved 300 Indians by warning them of\r\nan intended attack by the federal troops. He spoke strongly in favor\r\nof the despised Yutas, declared that they are ready to work, and can\r\nbe led to any thing by civility. The anti-Mormons declared that his\r\npraise was for interested motives, wishing the savages to labor for him\r\ngratis; and I observed that when Mr. Waddington started to cut wood in\r\nthe kanyon, he set out at night, lest his dust should be seen by his\r\nred friends.\r\n\r\nThe Mormons were not wanting in kindness; they supplied us with\r\nexcellent potatoes, and told us to make their house our home. We\r\npreferred, however, living and cooking afield. The station was dirty to\r\nthe last degree: the flies suggested the Egyptian plague; they could\r\nbe brushed from the walls in thousands; but, though sage makes good\r\nbrooms, no one cares to sweep clean. This, I repeat, is not Mormon,\r\nbut Western: the people, like the Spaniards, apparently disdain any\r\noccupation save that of herding cattle, and will do so till the land is\r\nsettled. In the evening Jake the Shoshonee came in, grumbling loudly\r\nbecause he had not been allowed to ride; he stood cross-legged like an\r\nAfrican, ate a large supper at the station, and a second with us. No\r\nwonder that the savage in civilization suffers, like the lady’s lapdog,\r\nfrom “liver.” He was, however, a first-rate hand in shirking any work\r\nexcept that of peering and peeping into every thing; neither Gospel\r\nnor gunpowder can reform this race. Mr.R----, the English farrier and\r\nLothario, left us on this day, after a little quarrel with Kennedy. We\r\nwere glad to receive permission to sleep upon the loose wheat in an\r\ninner room: at 8 A.M. the thermometer had shown 59° F., but on this\r\nnight ice appeared in the pails.\r\n\r\nThe next day was a halt; the stock wanted rest and the men provisions.\r\nA “beef”--the Westerns still retain the singular of “beeves”--was\r\nkilled, and we obtained a store of potatoes and wheat. Default of oats,\r\nwhich are not common, this heating food is given to horses--12 lbs.\r\nof grain to 14 of long forage--and the furious riding of the Mormons\r\nis the only preventive of its evil effects. The people believe that\r\nit causes stumbling by the swelling of the fetlock and knee joint;\r\nsimilarly every East Indian ghorewalla will declare that wheaten bread\r\nmakes a horse tokkar khana--“eat trips.” The _employés_ of the station\r\nwere quiet and respectable, a fact attributed by some of our party to\r\nthe want of liquor, which is said to cause frequent fights. Our party\r\nwas less peaceable; there had been an extensive prigging of blankets;\r\nthe cold now made them valuable, and this drove the losers “fighting\r\nmad.”\r\n\r\n  _En route again. 3d October._\r\n\r\nThe severity of the last night made us active; the appearance of deep\r\nsnow upon the mountains and of ice in the valleys was an intelligible\r\nhint that the Sierra Nevada which lay before us would be by no means\r\nan easy task. Despite, therefore, the idleness always engendered by a\r\nhalt, and the frigid blasts which poured down from the eastern hills,\r\nwhere rain was falling in torrents, we hitched up, bade adieu to our\r\nMormon host, and set out about 4 P.M. Antelope Springs, the next\r\nstation, was 30 miles distant; we resolved, therefore, to divide it,\r\nafter the fashion of Asia and Africa, by a short forenoon march.\r\n\r\nThe road runs to the southwest down the Deep-Creek Valley, and along\r\nthe left bank of the western rivulet. Near the divide we found a\r\ngood bottom, with plenty of water and grass; the only fuel was the\r\nsage-bush, which crackled merrily, like thorns, under the pot, but\r\ntainted the contents with its medicinal odor. The wagons were drawn\r\nup in a half circle to aid us in catching the mules; the animals were\r\nturned out to graze, the men were divided into watches, and the masters\r\ntook up their quarters in the wagons. Age gave the judge a claim to the\r\nambulance, which was admitted by all hands; I slept with “Scotch Joe,”\r\nan exceedingly surly youth, who apparently preferred any thing to work.\r\nAt 8 P.M. a storm of wind and rain burst upon us from the S.W.: it was\r\nso violent that the wagons rocked before the blast, and at times the\r\nchance of a capsize suggested itself. The weather was highly favorable\r\nfor Indian plundering, who on such nights expect to make a successful\r\nattack.\r\n\r\n  _To the Wilderness. 4th October._\r\n\r\n[EIGHT-MILE SPRINGS.]\r\n\r\nWe awoke early in the frigid S.W. wind, the thermometer showing 39° F.\r\nAfter a few hundred yards we reached “Eight-mile Springs,” so called\r\nfrom the distance to Deep Creek. The road, which yesterday would have\r\nbeen dusty to the hub, was now heavy and viscid; the rain had washed\r\nout the saleratus, and the sight and scent, and the country generally,\r\nwere those of the environs of a horse-pond. An ugly stretch of two\r\nmiles, perfectly desert, led to Eight-mile-Spring Kanyon, a jagged\r\nlittle ravine about 500 yards long, with a portaled entrance of tall\r\nrock. It is not, however, considered dangerous.\r\n\r\nBeyond the kanyon lay another grisly land, if possible more deplorable\r\nthan before; its only crops were dust and mud. On the right hand were\r\nturreted rocks, around whose base ran Indian trails, and a violent\r\nwest wind howled over their summits. About 1 30 P.M. we came upon the\r\nstation at Antelope Springs: it had been burned by the Gosh Yutas in\r\nthe last June, and had never been rebuilt. “George,” our cook, who had\r\nbeen one of the inmates at the time, told us how he and his _confrères_\r\nhad escaped. Fortunately, the corral still stood: we found wood in\r\nplenty, water was lying in an adjoining bottom, and we used the two to\r\nbrew our tea.\r\n\r\n[SHELL CREEK.]\r\n\r\nBeyond Antelope Springs was Shell Creek, distant thirty miles by\r\nlong road and eighteen by the short cut. We had some difficulty in\r\npersuading Kennedy to take the latter; property not only sharpens the\r\nintellect, it also generates prudence, and the ravine is a well-known\r\nplace for ambush. Fortunately two express riders came in and offered\r\nto precede us, which encouraged us. About 3 P.M. we left the springs\r\nand struck for the mouth of the kanyon, which has not been named;\r\nSevier and Farish are the rival claimants. Entering the jagged fir\r\nand pine-clad breach, we found the necessity of dismounting. The bed\r\nwas dry--it floods in spring and autumn--but very steep, and in a\r\nhole on the right stood water, which we did not touch for fear of\r\npoison. Reaching the summit in about an hour we saw below the shaggy\r\nforeground of evergreens, or rather ever-blacks, which cast grotesque\r\nand exaggerated shadows in the last rays of day, the snowy-white\r\nmountains, gloriously sunlit, on the far side of Shell Creek. Here for\r\nthe first time appeared the piñon pine (_P. Monophyllus_), which forms\r\nthe principal part of the Indian’s diet; it was no beauty to look upon,\r\na dwarfish tree, rendered shrub-like by being feathered down to the\r\nground. The nut is ripe in early autumn, at which time the savages stow\r\naway their winter provision in dry ravines and pits. The fruit is about\r\nthe size of a pistachio, with a decided flavor of turpentine, tolerably\r\npalatable, and at first laxative. The cones are thrown upon the fire,\r\nand when slightly burnt the nuts are easily extracted; these are eaten\r\nraw, or like the Hindoo’s toasted grains. The harvest is said to fail\r\nevery second year. Last season produced a fine crop, while in this\r\nautumn many of the trees were found, without apparent reason but frost,\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nWe resumed the descent along a fiumara, which presently “sank,” and at\r\n5 P.M. halted in a prairillon somewhat beyond. Bunch-grass, sage-fuel,\r\nand water were abundant, but the place was favorable for an attack.\r\nIt is a golden rule in an Indian country never to pitch near trees or\r\nrocks that can mask an approach, and we were breaking it in a place of\r\ndanger. However, the fire was extinguished early, so as to prevent its\r\nbecoming a mark for Indians, and the pickets, placed on both sides of\r\nthe ravine, were directed to lie motionless a little below the crest,\r\nand to fire at the first comer. I need hardly say we were not murdered;\r\nthe cold, however, was uncommonly piercing.\r\n\r\n  _To “Robber’s Roost.” 5th October._\r\n\r\nWe set out at 6 A.M. the next morning, through a mixture of snow and\r\nhail and howling wind, to finish the ravine, which was _in toto_\r\neight miles long. The descent led us to Spring Valley, a bulge in the\r\nmountains about eight miles broad, which a sharp divide separates from\r\nShell Valley, its neighbor. On the summit we fell into the line of\r\nrivulet which gives the low lands a name. At the foot of the descent\r\nwe saw a woodman, and presently the station. Nothing could more want\r\ntidying than this log hut, which showed the bullet-marks of a recent\r\nIndian attack. The master was a Français de France, Constant Dubail,\r\nand an ex-Lancier: his mother’s gossip had received a remittance of\r\n2000 francs from a son in California, consequently he had torn himself\r\nfrom the _sein_ of _sa pauvre mère_, and with three others had started\r\nin search of fortune, and had nearly starved. The express riders were\r\nthree roughs, of whom one was a Mormon. We passed our time while the\r\nmules were at bait in visiting the springs. There is a cold creek 200\r\nyards below the station, and close by the hut a warm rivulet, said to\r\ncontain leeches. The American hirudo, however, has a serious defect\r\nin a leech--it will not bite; the faculty, therefore, are little\r\naddicted to hirudination; country doctors rarely keep the villainous\r\nbloodsuckers, and only the wealthy can afford the pernicious luxury,\r\nwhich, imported from Spain, costs $12 per dozen, somewhat the same\r\nprice as oysters at Nijni Novgorod.\r\n\r\nThe weather, which was vile till 10 A.M., when the glass showed 40°\r\n(F.), promised to amend, and as the filthy hole--still full of flies,\r\ndespite the cold--offered no attraction, we set out at 2 P.M. for\r\nEgan’s Station, beyond an ill-omened kanyon of the same name. We\r\ndescended into a valley by a regular slope--in proportion as we leave\r\ndistance between us and the Great Salt Lake the bench formation on this\r\nline becomes less distinct--and traversed a barren plain by a heavy\r\nroad. Hares and prairie-hens seemed, however, to like it, and a frieze\r\nof willow thicket at the western end showed the presence of water. We\r\nin the ambulance halted at the mouth of the kanyon; the stock and the\r\nboys had fallen far behind, and the place had an exceedingly bad name.\r\nBut the cold was intense, the shades of evening were closing in, so we\r\nmade ready for action, looked to the priming of gun and revolver, and\r\nthen _en avant_! After passing that kanyon we should exchange the land\r\nof the Gosh Yuta for those of the more friendly Shoshonee.\r\n\r\n[AN UGLY PLACE.]\r\n\r\nAn uglier place for sharp-shooting can hardly be imagined. The floor\r\nof the kanyon is almost flush with the bases of the hills, and in such\r\nformations, the bed of the creek which occupies the sole is rough\r\nand winding. The road was vile--now winding along, then crossing the\r\nstream--hedged in with thicket and dotted with boulders. Ahead of us\r\nwas a rocky projection which appeared to cross our path, and upon this\r\nPoint Dangerous every eye was fixed.\r\n\r\n[COLD COMFORT.]\r\n\r\nSuddenly my eye caught sight of one fire--two fires under the black\r\nbunch of firs half way up the hill-side on our left, and as suddenly\r\nthey were quenched, probably with snow. Nothing remained but to hear\r\nthe war-whoop, and to see a line of savages rushing down the rocks.\r\nWe loosed the doors of the ambulance, that we might jump out, if\r\nnecessary, and tree ourselves behind it; and knowing that it would be\r\nuseless to return, drove on at our fastest speed, with sleet, snow,\r\nand wind in our faces. Under the circumstances, it was cold comfort\r\nto find, when we had cleared the kanyon, that Egan’s Station at the\r\nfarther mouth had been reduced to a chimney-stack and a few charred\r\nposts. The Gosh Yutas had set fire to it two or three days before\r\nour arrival, in revenge for the death of seventeen of their men by\r\nLieutenant Weed’s party. We could distinguish the pits from which the\r\nwolves had torn up the corpses, and one fellow’s arm projected from\r\nthe snow. After a hurried deliberation, in which Kennedy swore, with\r\nthat musical voice in which the Dublin swains delight, that “shure\r\nwe were all kilt”--the possession of property not only actuates the\r\nmind, and adds industry to its qualities, it also produces a peculiar\r\ndevelopment of cautiousness--we unhitched the mules, tethered them to\r\nthe ambulance, and planted ourselves behind the palisade, awaiting all\r\ncomers, till the boys could bring re-enforcement. The elements fought\r\nfor us: although two tongues of high land directly in front of us would\r\nhave formed a fine mask for approach, the snow lay in so even a sheet\r\nthat a prowling coyote was detected, and the hail-like sleet which beat\r\nfiercely on our backs would have been a sore inconvenience to a party\r\nattacking in face. Our greatest disadvantage was the extreme cold; it\r\nwas difficult to keep a finger warm enough to draw a trigger. Thomas,\r\nthe judgeling, so he was called, was cool as a cucumber, mentally and\r\nbodily: youths generally are. Firstly, they have their “_preuves_” to\r\nmake; secondly, they know not what they do.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour’s freezing, which seemed a day’s, we heard with quickened\r\nears the shouts and tramp of the boys and the stock, which took a\r\nterrible load off the exile of Erin’s heart. We threw ourselves into\r\nthe wagons, numbed with cold, and forgot, on the soft piles of saddles,\r\nbridles, and baggage, and under heaps of blankets and buffalos, the\r\npains of Barahut. About 3 A.M. this enjoyment was brought to a close\r\nby arriving at the end of the stage, Butte Station. The road was six\r\ninches deep with snow, and the final ascent was accomplished with\r\ndifficulty. The good station-master, Mr. Thomas, a Cambrian Mormon, who\r\nhad, he informed me, three brothers in the British army, bade us kindly\r\nwelcome, built a roaring fire, added meat to our supper of coffee and\r\ndoughboy, and cleared by a summary process among the snorers places\r\nfor us on the floor of “Robber’s Roost,” or “Thieves’ Delight,” as the\r\nplace is facetiously known throughout the country-side.\r\n\r\n  _Halt at “Robber’s Roost.” 6th October._\r\n\r\n[THE WESTERN MAN’S HOME.]\r\n\r\nThe last night’s sound sleep was allowed to last through the morning.\r\nThis day was perforce a halt: the old white mare and her colt had\r\nbeen left at the mouth of the kanyon, and one of the Shoshonee Indian\r\nservants of the station had been persuaded by a bribe of a blanket and\r\nsome gunpowder to return for them. About noon we arose, expecting a\r\nblack fog, and looked down upon Butte Valley, whose northern edge we\r\nhad traversed last night. Snow still lay there--that bottom is rarely\r\nwithout frost--but in the fine clear sunny day, with the mercury at 43°\r\nF. in the shade, the lowest levels re-became green, the hill cedars\r\nturned once more black, earth steamed like a garment hung out to dry,\r\nand dark spots here and there mottled the hills, which were capped with\r\nhuge turbans of muslin-like mist. While the Shoshonee is tracking and\r\ndriving the old mare, we will glance around the “Robber’s Roost,” which\r\nwill answer for a study of the Western man’s home.\r\n\r\nIt is about as civilized as the Galway shanty, or the normal\r\ndwelling-place in Central Equatorial Africa. A cabin fronting east and\r\nwest, long walls thirty feet, with port-holes for windows, short ditto\r\nfifteen; material, sandstone and bog ironstone slabs compacted with\r\nmud, the whole roofed with split cedar trunks, reposing on horizontals\r\nwhich rested on perpendiculars. Behind the house a corral of rails\r\nplanted in the ground; the inclosed space a mass of earth, and a mere\r\nshed in one corner the only shelter. Outside the door--the hingeless\r\nand lockless backboard of a wagon, bearing the wounds of bullets--and\r\nresting on lintels and staples, which also had formed parts of\r\nlocomotives, a slab acting stepping-stone over a mass of soppy black\r\nsoil strewed with ashes, gobs of meat offals, and other delicacies. On\r\nthe right hand a load of wood; on the left a tank formed by damming a\r\ndirty pool which had flowed through a corral behind the “Roost.” There\r\nwas a regular line of drip distilling from the caked and hollowed snow\r\nwhich toppled from the thick thatch above the cedar braces.\r\n\r\nThe inside reflected the outside. The length was divided by two\r\nperpendiculars, the southernmost of which, assisted by a half-way\r\ncanvas partition, cut the hut into unequal parts. Behind it were two\r\nbunks for four men: standing bedsteads of poles planted in the ground,\r\nas in Australia and Unyamwezi, and covered with piles of ragged\r\nblankets. Beneath the frame-work were heaps of rubbish, saddles,\r\ncloths, harness, and straps, sacks of wheat, oats, meal, and potatoes,\r\ndefended from the ground by underlying logs, and dogs nestled where\r\nthey found room. The floor, which also frequently represented bedstead,\r\nwas rough, uneven earth, neither tamped nor swept, and the fine end of\r\na spring oozing through the western wall kept part of it in a state of\r\neternal mud. A redeeming point was the fireplace, which occupied half\r\nof the northern short wall: it might have belonged to Guy of Warwick’s\r\ngreat hall; its ingle nooks boasted dimensions which one connects with\r\nan idea of hospitality and jollity; while a long hook hanging down it\r\nspoke of the bouillon-pot, and the iron oven of hot rolls. Nothing\r\ncould be more simple than the furniture. The chairs were either posts\r\nmounted on four legs spread out for a base, or three-legged stools with\r\nreniform seats. The tables were rough-dressed planks, two feet by two,\r\non rickety trestles. One stood in the centre for feeding purposes; the\r\nother was placed as buffet in the corner near the fire, with eating\r\napparatus--tin coffee-pot and gamelles, rough knives, “pitchforks,”\r\nand pewter spoons. The walls were pegged to support spurs and pistols,\r\nwhips, gloves, and leggins. Over the door, in a niche, stood a broken\r\ncoffee-mill, for which a flat stone did duty. Near the entrance, on a\r\nbroad shelf raised about a foot from the ground, lay a tin skillet and\r\nits “dipper.” Soap was supplied by a handful of gravel, and evaporation\r\nwas expected to act towel. Under the board was a pail of water with\r\na floating can, which enabled the inmates to supply the drainage of\r\neverlasting chaws. There was no sign of Bible, Shakspeare, or Milton;\r\na Holywell-Street romance or two was the only attempt at literature.\r\n_En revanche_, weapons of the flesh, rifles, guns, and pistols, lay and\r\nhung all about the house, carelessly stowed as usual, and tools were\r\nnot wanting--hammers, large borers, axe, saw, and chisel. An almost\r\ninvariable figure in these huts is an Indian standing cross-legged at\r\nthe door, or squatting uncomfortably close to the fire. He derides\r\nthe whites for their wastefulness, preferring to crouch in parties of\r\nthree or four over a little bit of fuel than to sit before a blazing\r\nlog. These savages act, among other things, as hunters, bringing home\r\nrabbits and birds. We tried our revolvers against one of them, and beat\r\nhim easily; yet they are said to put, three times out of four, an arrow\r\nthrough a keyhole forty paces off. In shooting they place the thumb and\r\nforefinger of the right hand upon the notch, and strengthen the pull by\r\nmeans of the second finger stretched along the bowstring. The left hand\r\nholds the whipped handle, and the shaft rests upon the knuckle of the\r\nindex.\r\n\r\nFrom Mr. Thomas we heard an account of the affair which took place near\r\nEgan’s Kanyon. In the last August, Lieutenant Weed happened to be “on\r\na scout,” with seventeen mounted riflemen, after Indians. An express\r\nrider from the West had ridden up to the station, which, being in a\r\nhollow, can not be seen from afar, and found it surrounded by Gosh\r\nYuta Indians. The fellows had tied up the master and the boy, and were\r\npreparing with civilized provisions a good dinner for themselves, to be\r\nfollowed by a little treat in the form of burning down the house and\r\nroasting their captives. The Indians allowed the soldiers brought up\r\nby the express rider to draw near, thinking that the dust was raised\r\nby fresh arrivals of their own people; and when charged, at once fled.\r\nThe mounted riflemen were armed with revolvers, not with sabres, or\r\nthey would have done considerable execution; as it was, seventeen of\r\nthe enemy remained upon the field, besides those who were carried off\r\nby their friends. The Indian will always leave a scalped and wounded\r\nfellow-tribesman in favor of an unscalped corpse.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the Shoshonee returned, bringing with him the white mare\r\nand her colt, which he had recovered _selon lui_ from the hands of two\r\nGosh Yutas. The weather still held up; we had expected to be snowed up\r\nin five days or so; our departure, therefore, was joyfully fixed for\r\nthe morrow.\r\n\r\n  _To Ruby Valley. 7th October._\r\n\r\nA frosty night was followed by a Tuscan day: a cold tramontana from the\r\nsouth, and a clear hot sun, which expanded the mercury at 10 A.M. to\r\n70° F. After taking leave of the hospitable station-master, we resumed\r\nthe road which ran up the short and heavy ascent, through a country\r\nhere and there eighteen inches deep in snow, and abounding in large\r\nsage and little rabbits. A descent led into Long Valley, whose northern\r\nend we crossed, and then we came upon a third ascent, where, finding a\r\nsinking creek, a halt was called for lunch. The formation of the whole\r\ncountry is a succession of basins and divides. Ensued another twelve\r\nmiles’ descent, which placed us in sight of Ruby Valley, and a mile\r\nbeyond carried us to the station.\r\n\r\n[RUBY VALLEY.]\r\n\r\nRuby Valley is a half-way house, about 300 miles from Great Salt Lake\r\nCity, and at the same distance from Carson Valley. It derives its\r\nname from the small precious stones which are found like nuggets of\r\ngold in the crevices of primitive rock. The length of the valley is\r\nabout 100 miles, by three or four broad, and springs are scattered\r\nin numbers along the base of the western mountains. The cold is said\r\nto be here more severe than in any place on the line of road, Spring\r\nValley excepted. There is, however, excellent bench-land for grazing.\r\nIn this season the scenery is really pretty. The white peaks tower over\r\nhill-land black with cedar, and this looks down upon the green bottom\r\nscattered over with white sage--winter above lying by the side of\r\nsummer below.\r\n\r\n[“UNCLE BILLY.”]\r\n\r\nWe were received at the Ruby-Valley Station by Colonel Rogers, better\r\nknown as “Uncle Billy.” He had served in the troublous days of\r\nCalifornia as marshal, and has many a hairbreadth escape to relate.\r\nHe is now assistant Indian agent, the superintendent of a government\r\nmodel farm, and he lives _en garçon_, having left his wife and children\r\nat Frogtown. We were soon introduced to the chief of the country,\r\nChy̆ŭkŭpĭchyă (the “old man”), a word of unpronounceable slur, changed\r\nby whites into Chokop (“earth”). His lands are long to the north and\r\nsouth, though of little breadth. He commands about 500 warriors, and,\r\nas Uncle Billy is returning to Frogtown, he is collecting a large\r\nhunting-party for the autumnal battue. In 1849 his sister was wantonly\r\nshot by emigrants to California. He attacked the train, and slew\r\nin revenge five men, a fact with which we were not made acquainted\r\ntill after our departure. His father and grandfather are both alive,\r\nbut they have abdicated under the weight of years and infirmities,\r\nreserving their voices for the powwow.\r\n\r\nWe dined in the colonel’s stone hut, and then saw the lions feed;\r\nafter us, Chokop and five followers sat down with knife and fork\r\nbefore a huge tureen full of soft pie, among which they did terrible\r\nexecution, champing and chewing with the noisiness of wild beasts, and\r\neating each enough for three able-bodied sailors. The chief, a young\r\nman twenty-five years old, had little to denote the Indian except\r\nvermilion where soap should have been; one of his companions, however,\r\ncrowned with eagle’s feathers disposed in tulip shape, while the claws\r\ndepended gracefully down his back, was an object worthy of Guinea. All\r\nwere, however, to appearance, happy, and for the first time I heard\r\nan Indian really laugh outright. Outside squatted the common herd in a\r\ncostume which explains the prevalence of rheumatism. The men were in\r\nrags, yet they had their coquetry, vermilion streaked down their cheeks\r\nand across their foreheads--the Indian fashion of the omnilocal rouge.\r\nThe women, especially the elders, were horrid objects, shivering and\r\nhalf dressed in breech-cloths and scanty capes or tippets of wolf and\r\nrabbit skin: the existence of old age, however, speaks well for the\r\nrace. Both are unclean; they use no water where Asiatics would; they\r\nignore soap, and rarely repair to the stream, except, like animals, in\r\nhot weather.\r\n\r\nWe then strolled about the camp and called upon the two Mistresses\r\nChokop. One was a buxom dame, broad and strong, with hair redolent of\r\nantelope marrow, who boasted of a “wikeap” or wigwam in the shape of\r\na conical tent. The other, much her junior, and rather pretty, was\r\nsitting apart in a bower of bushes, with a newly-born pappoose in a\r\nwillow cage to account for her isolation: the poor thing would have\r\nbeen driven out even in the depth of winter, and were she to starve,\r\nshe must do without meat. As among the Jews, whenever the Great Father\r\nis angry with the daughters of Red Men, they sit apart; they never\r\ntouch a cooking utensil, although it is not held impure to address\r\nthem, and they return only when the signs of wrath have passed away.\r\nThe abodes of the poorer clansmen were three-quarter circles of earth,\r\nsticks, and sage-bush to keep off the southerly wind. A dog is usually\r\none of the occupants. Like the African, the Indian is cruel to his\r\nbrute, starves it and kicks it for attempting to steal a mouthful:\r\n“Love me, love my dog,” however, is his motto, and he quarrels with\r\nthe stranger that follows his example. The furniture was primitive.\r\nUpon a branch hung a dried antelope head used in stalking: concerning\r\nthis sport Uncle Billy had a story of his nearly being shot by being\r\nmistaken for the real animal; and tripods of timber supporting cloths\r\nand moccasins, pans, camp-kettles, stones for grinding grass-seed, and\r\na variety of baskets. The material was mostly willow twig, with a layer\r\nof gum, probably from the pine-tree. Some were water-tight like the\r\n“Hán” of Somaliland; others, formed like the Roman amphora, were for\r\nstoring grain; while others, in giant cocked-hat shape, were intended\r\nfor sweeping in crickets and the grass-seeds upon which these Indians\r\nfeed. The chief gramineæ are the atriplex and chenopodaceous plants.\r\nAfter inspecting the camp we retired precipitately: its condition was\r\nthat of an Egyptian army’s last nighting-place.\r\n\r\n[PRICE OF A GOVERNMENT FARM.]\r\n\r\nAbout two miles from the station there is a lake covered with\r\nwater-fowl, from the wild swan to the rail. I preferred, however, to\r\ncorrect my Shoshonee vocabulary under the inspection of Mose Wright,\r\nan express rider from a neighboring station. None of your “one-horse”\r\ninterpreters, he had learned the difficult dialect in his youth, and\r\nhe had acquired all the intonation of an Indian. Educated beyond the\r\nreach of civilization, he was in these days an oddity; he was convicted\r\nof having mistaken a billiard cue for a whip handle, and was accused\r\nof having mounted the post supporting the electric telegraph wire in\r\norder to hear what it was saying. The evening was spent in listening to\r\nUncle Billy’s adventures among the whites and reds. He spoke highly of\r\nhis _protégés_, especially of their affection and fidelity in married\r\nlife: they certainly appeared to look upon him as a father. He owed\r\nsomething to legerdemain; here, as in Algeria, a Houdin or a Love would\r\nbe great medicine-men with whom nobody would dare to meddle. Uncle\r\nBilly managed to make the post pay by peltries of the mink, wolf,\r\nwoodchuck or ground-hog, fox, badger, antelope, black-tailed deer, and\r\nothers. He illustrated the peculiarities of the federal government by a\r\ncurious anecdote. The indirect or federal duties are in round numbers\r\n$100,000,000, of which $60,000,000 are spent, leaving a surplus of\r\nforty for the purpose of general corruption: the system seems to date\r\nfrom the days of the “ultimus Romanorum,” President Jackson. None but\r\nthe largest claimants can expect to be recognized. A few years ago one\r\nof the Indian agents in ---- was asked by a high official what might be\r\nabout the cost of purchasing a few hundred acres for a government farm.\r\nAfter reckoning up the amount of beads, wire, blankets, and gunpowder,\r\nthe total was found to be $240. The high official requested his friend\r\nto place the statement on paper, and was somewhat surprised the next\r\nmorning to see the $240 swollen to $40,000. The reason given was\r\ncharacteristic: “What great government would condescend to pay out of\r\n£8,000,000 a paltry £48, or would refuse to give £8000?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTo Carson Valley.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore resuming the Itinerary, it may be advisable briefly to describe\r\nthe various tribes tenanting this Territory.\r\n\r\nWe have now emerged from the Prairie Indians, the Dakotah, Crow, Kiowa,\r\nComanche, Osage, Apache, Cheyenne, Pawnee, and Arapaho. Utah Territory\r\ncontains a total of about 19,000 souls of two great kindred races,\r\nthe Shoshonee or Snake, and the Yuta, called Uche by the Spaniards\r\nand Ute by the Anglo-American trappers. Like the Comanche and Apache,\r\nthe Pimas, the Lipans, and the people of the Pueblos, they are of the\r\nHispano-American division, once subject to the Conquistadores, and\r\nare bounded north by the Pánák[228] (Bannack) and the once formidable\r\nBlackfeet. The Shoshonee own about one third of the Territory; their\r\nprincipal settlements lie north of the Great Salt Lake, and on the line\r\nof the Humboldt or Mary River, some 400 miles west, and 100 to 125\r\nsouth of the Oregon line. They number about 4500 souls, and are wildest\r\nin the southeast parts of their motherland. The Yuta claim the rest of\r\nthe Territory between Kansas, the Sierra Nevada, New Mexico, and the\r\nOregon frontier. Of course the two peoples are mortal foes, and might\r\nbe well pitted against each other. The Snakes would form excellent\r\npartisan warriors.\r\n\r\n  [228] The Panak is a small tribe of 500 souls, now considered\r\n  dangerous: the greater part resides in Oregon, the smaller about\r\n  ninety miles in the N.E. of the Territory, where they hunt the bison\r\n  and the elk. For thirty years they have traded with Fort Bridger, and\r\n  when first known they numbered 1200 lodges. “Horn,” their principal\r\n  chief, visited the place in April, 1858. Mr. Forney, the late\r\n  Superintendent of Indian Affairs in Utah Territory, granted them a\r\n  home in the lands of Washaki, and they have intermarried and lived\r\n  peaceably with the Shoshonee.\r\n\r\nThe Shoshonee number fourteen tribes regularly organized; the\r\nprincipal, which contains about 12,000 souls, is commanded by Washaki,\r\nassisted, as usual, by sub-chiefs, four to six in number. Five bands,\r\nnumbering near 1000 each, roam about the mountains and kanyons of Great\r\nSalt Lake County, Weber, Bear, Cache, and Malad Valleys, extending\r\neighty miles north from the Holy City. These have suffered the most\r\nfrom proximity with the whites, and no longer disdain agriculture. One\r\nband, 150 to 180 in number, confines itself to the North Californian\r\nRoute from Bear and Malad Valleys to the Goose-Creek Mountains. Seven\r\nbands roam over the country from the Humboldt River to 100 miles south\r\nof it, and extend about 200 miles from east to west: the principal\r\nchief, Wanamuka, or “the Giver,” had a band of 155 souls, and lived\r\nnear the Honey Lake.\r\n\r\nThe Yuta claim, like the Shoshonee, descent from an ancient people\r\nthat immigrated into their present seats from the northwest. During\r\nthe last thirty years they have considerably decreased according to\r\nthe mountaineers, and have been demoralized mentally and physically by\r\nthe emigrants: formerly they were friendly, now they are often at war\r\nwith the intruders. As in Australia, arsenic and corrosive sublimate in\r\nsprings and provisions have diminished their number. The nation is said\r\nto contain a total of 14,000 to 15,000 souls, divided into twenty-seven\r\nbands, of which the following are the principal:\r\n\r\nThe Pá Yuta (Pey Utes) are the most docile, interesting, and powerful,\r\ncontaining twelve bands;[229] those in the west of the Territory,\r\non the Humboldt River, number 6000, and in the south 2200 souls;\r\nthey extend from forty miles west of Stony Point to the Californian\r\nline, and northwest to the Oregon line, and inhabit the valley of the\r\nFenelon River, which, rising from Lake Bigler, empties itself into\r\nPyramid Lake. The term means Water Yuta, that is to say, those who live\r\nupon fish which they take from lakes and rivers in wiers and traps\r\nof willow, preferring that diet to roots, grass-seed, lizards, and\r\ncrickets, the food of the other so-called Digger tribes.\r\n\r\n  [229] These are, 1. Wanamuka’s; 2. San Joaquim, near the forks\r\n  of that river in Carson Valley, numbering 170; 3. Hadsapoke, or\r\n  Horse-stopper band, of 110, in Gold Kanyon, on Carson River; 4. Wahi\r\n  or Fox band, on Big Bend of Carson River, 130 in number; 5. and 6.\r\n  Odakeo, “Tall-man band,” and Petodseka, “White-Spot band,” round the\r\n  lakes and sinks of the Carson and Walker Rivers, numbering 484 men,\r\n  372 women, and 405 children; 7. Tosarke, “Gray-head band,” their\r\n  neighbors; 8. Tonoziet, “Woman-helper band,” on the Truckee River,\r\n  below Big Meadows, numbering 280 souls; 9. Torape, or “Lean-man\r\n  band,” on the Truckee River, near Lone Crossing, 360 souls; 10.\r\n  Gonega, the “Dancer band,” 290 souls, near the mouth of the Truckee\r\n  River; 11. Watsequendo, the “Four Crows,” along the shores of Pyramid\r\n  Lake, 320 souls; 12. The second Wanamuka’s band, 500 in number, along\r\n  the shores of the Northern Mud Lake.\r\n\r\n[THE GOSH YUTA, ETC.]\r\n\r\nGosh Yuta, or Gosha Ute, is a small band, once _protégés_ of the\r\nShoshonee, who have the same language and limits. Their principal chief\r\ndied about five years ago, when the tribe was broken up. A body of\r\nsixty, under a peaceful leader, were settled permanently on the Indian\r\nfarm at Deep Creek, and the remainder wandered 40 to 200 miles west of\r\nGreat Salt Lake City. Through this tribe our road lay; during the late\r\ntumults they have lost fifty warriors, and are now reduced to about 200\r\nmen. Like the Ghuzw of Arabia, they strengthen themselves by admitting\r\nthe outcasts of other tribes, and will presently become a mere banditti.\r\n\r\nPavant, or Parovan Yuta, are a distinct and self-organized tribe, under\r\none principal and several sub-chiefs, whose total is set down at 700\r\nsouls. Half of them are settled on the Indian farm at Corn Creek; the\r\nother wing of the tribe lives along Sevier Lake, and the surrounding\r\ncountry in the northeast extremity of Fillmore Valley, fifty miles from\r\nthe city, where they join the Gosh Yuta. The Pavants breed horses, wear\r\nclothes of various patterns, grow grain, which the Gosh Yutas will not,\r\nand are as brave and improvable as their neighbors are mean and vile.\r\n\r\nTimpenaguchyă,[230] or Timpana Yuta, corrupted into Tenpenny Utes, who\r\ndwell about the kanyon of that name, and on the east of the Sweetwater\r\nLake. Of this tribe was the chief Wakara, who so called himself after\r\nWalker, the celebrated trapper; the notorious horse-stealer proved\r\nhimself a friend to the Latter-Day Saints. He died at Meadow Creek,\r\nsix miles from Fillmore City, on the 29th of January, 1855, and at his\r\nobsequies two squaws, two Pa Yuta children, and fifteen of his best\r\nhorses composed the “customs.”\r\n\r\n  [230] In the Yuta language meaning “water among the stones.”\r\n\r\nUinta Yuta, in the mountains south of Fort Bridger, and in the country\r\nalong the Green River. Of this tribe, which contains a total of\r\n1000, a band of 500, under four chiefs, lately settled on the Indian\r\nreservations at Spanish Fork.\r\n\r\nSampichyă, corrupted, to San Pete Utas; about eighty warriors, settled\r\non the Indian farm at San Pete. This and the Spanish-Fork Farm number\r\n900 inhabitants.\r\n\r\nElk-Mountain Yutas, who are set down at 2000 souls, by some even 3000;\r\nthey wander over the southeast portion of the Territory, and, like the\r\nUinta Yutas, are the most independent of white settlers.\r\n\r\nWeber-River Yutas are those principally seen in Great Salt Lake City;\r\nthey are a poor and degraded tribe. Their chief settlement is forty\r\nmiles to the north, and, like the Gosh Yutas, they understand Shoshonee.\r\n\r\nAmong the Yutas are reckoned the Washoe, from 500 to 700 souls. They\r\ninhabit the eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada, from Honey Lake to\r\nthe West Fork of Walker’s River in the south. Of this troublesome\r\ntribe there are three bands: Captain Jim’s, near Lake Bigler, and\r\nCarson, Washoe, and Eagle Valleys, a total of 342 souls; Pasuka’s band,\r\n340 souls, in Little Valley; and Deer Dick’s band, in Long Valley,\r\nsoutheast of Honey Lake. They are usually called Shoshoko,[231] or\r\n“Digger Indians”--a term as insulting to a Shoshonee as nigger to an\r\nAfrican.\r\n\r\n  [231] It is said to mean “one who goes on foot.”\r\n\r\nBesides the Parawat Yutas, the Yampas, 200-300 miles south, on the\r\nWhite River; the Tabechyă, or Sun-hunters, about Tête de Biche, near\r\nSpanish lands; and the Tash Yuta, near the Navajoes: there are scatters\r\nof the nation along the Californian road from Beaver Valley, along the\r\nSanta Clara, Virgen, Las Vegas, and Muddy Rivers to New Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe Indian Bureau of Utah Territory numbers one superintendent, six\r\nagents, and three to six farm-agents. The annual expenditure is set\r\ndown at $40,000; the Mormons declare that it is iniquitously embezzled,\r\nand that the total spent upon the Indians hardly exceeds $1000 per\r\nannum. The savages expect blankets and clothing, flour and provisions,\r\narms and ammunition: they receive only a little tobacco, become surly,\r\nand slay the settlers. It is understood that the surveyor general has\r\nrecommended to the federal government the extinction of the Indian\r\ntitle--somewhat upon the principle of the English in Tasmania[232] and\r\nNew Zealand--to grounds in the Utah Territory, and the establishment\r\nof a land-office for the sale of the two millions of acres already\r\nsurveyed. Until the citizens can own their farms and fields under the\r\nexisting pre-emption laws, and until the troublesome Indians can be\r\nremoved by treaty to reservations remote from white settlements, the\r\nonward march of progress will be arrested. The savage and the civilized\r\nman, like crabbed age and youth, like the black and gray rat, can not\r\nlive together: the former starves unless placed in the most fertile\r\nspots, which the latter of course covets; the Mormons attempt a peace\r\npolicy, but the hunting-grounds are encroached upon, and terrible\r\nmassacres are the result. Here, as elsewhere, the battle of life is\r\nfiercely fought. It has been said,\r\n\r\n    “Man differs more from man\r\n      Than beast from beast.”\r\n\r\nYet every where we trace the mighty resemblance.\r\n\r\n  [232] Van Diemen’s Land, in the days of Captain Flinders (A.D.\r\n  1800, two generations ago), had a population of 100,000 souls, now\r\n  well-nigh annihilated by strong waters and corrosive sublimate.\r\n  Neither man nor woman was safe in the vicinity of a native tribe;\r\n  the Anglo-Scandinavian race thus found it necessary to wipe out a\r\n  people that could not be civilized--a fair instance of the natural\r\n  selection of species. And New Zealand now threatens to walk the path\r\n  of Tasmania.\r\n\r\n[THE INDIAN FARMS.]\r\n\r\nThe three principal farms which now form the nuclei of future\r\nreservations are those at Spanish Fork, San Pete, and Corn Creek. The\r\ntwo latter have often been denuded by the grasshopper; the former has\r\nfared better. Situated in Utah Valley, under the shelter of lofty\r\nNebo, it extends northward within four miles of the Sweetwater Lake,\r\nand on the northeast is bounded by the Spanish-Fork Creek, rich in\r\ntrout and other fish. It was begun five years ago for the Yutas, who\r\nclaim the land, and contains a total of 13,000 acres, of which 500\r\nhave been cultivated; 900 have been ditched to protect the crop,\r\nand 1000 have been walled round with a fence six feet high. Besides\r\nother improvements, they have built a large adobe house and two rail\r\ncorrals, and dug dams and channels for irrigation, together with a\r\ngood stone-curbed well. Under civilized superintendence the savages\r\nbegin to labor, and the chiefs aspire to erect houses. Yet the crops\r\nhave been light, rarely exceeding 2500 bushels. San Pete Farm, in the\r\nvalley and on the creek of the same name, lies 150 miles south of Great\r\nSalt Lake City; it supports, besides those who come for temporary\r\nassistance, a band of thirty souls; 200 acres have been planted with\r\nwheat and potatoes, two adobe houses and a corral have been made, and\r\nirrigating trenches have been dug. Corn-Creek Farm, in Fillmore Valley,\r\nwas begun about four years ago; 300 acres have been broken up, several\r\nadobe houses have been built for the Indians and the farm agent, with\r\nthe usual adjuncts, corral and fences. The crickets and grasshoppers\r\nhave committed sad havoc among the wheat, corn, and potatoes. It is\r\nnow tenanted by a Pahvant chief. The Uinta Farm is near Fort Bridger.\r\nThose lately opened in Deep Creek and Ruby Valleys have this year lain\r\nfallow in consequence of Indian troubles; the soil, however, is rich,\r\nand will produce beets, potatoes, onions, turnips, and melons. It is\r\nproposed to place the Pa Yutas and Washoes in the Truckee Meadows, on\r\nthe lands “watered by the majestic Kuyuehup, or Salmon-Trout River,”\r\nwhere, besides fish and piñon forests, there are 15,000 acres fit for\r\ncultivation and herding. The Indian agents report that the cost will be\r\n$150,000, from which the Mormons deduct at least two 0’s.\r\n\r\n[THE YUTAS.]\r\n\r\nThe Yuta, though divided into many tribes and bands, is a distinct\r\nrace from its prairie neighbors, speaking a single _langue mère_ much\r\ndiversified by dialect. They are a superstitious brood, and have many\r\ncruel practices--human sacrifices and vivisepulture--like those of\r\nDahomey and Ashantee. Their religion is the usual African and Indian\r\nfetichism, that germal faith which, under favorable influences and\r\namong higher races, developed itself by natural means--or as explained\r\nby a mythical, distinct, and independent revelation--into the higher\r\nforms of Judaism, Christianity, and El Islam. In the vicinity of the\r\nMormons many savages have been baptized, and have become nominal\r\nSaints. They divide white men into Shwop or Americans and Mormons.\r\nTheir learned men have heard of Washington, but, like the French\r\npeasant’s superstition concerning Napoleon, they believe him to be\r\nstill alive. They have a name for the Book of Mormon, and have not\r\nlearned, like their more civilized Eastern neighbors, to look upon\r\nit as the work of Mujhe Manitou, the bad god, who, like Wiswakarma\r\nof the Hindoos, amuses himself by caricaturing and parodying the\r\ncreatures of the good god. They are not cannibals--the Wendigo is a\r\ngiant man-eater of a mythologic type, not an actual anthropophage--but,\r\nlike all Indians, especially those of New England, they “feel good”\r\nafter eating a bit of the enemy, a natural display of destructiveness:\r\nthey will devour the heart of a brave man to increase their courage,\r\nor chop it up, boil it in soup, engorge a ladleful, and boast they\r\nhave drunk the enemy’s blood. They are as liable to caprice as their\r\nEastern neighbors. A prisoner who has distinguished himself in battle\r\nis as often dismissed unhurt as porcupined with arrows and killed\r\nwith cruel tortures; if they yield in ingenuity of inflicting pain\r\nto the Algonquins and Iroquois, it is not for want of inclination,\r\nbut by reason of their stupidity. Female captives who fall into their\r\nhands are horribly treated; I was told of one who, after all manner of\r\natrocities, scalping included, escaped with life. They have all the\r\nsavage’s improvidence; utility is not their decalogue. Both sexes,\r\nexcept when clothed by a charitable Mormon, are nearly naked, even\r\nin the severest weather; they sleep in sleet and snow unclothed,\r\nexcept with a cape of twisted rabbits’ furs and a miserable attempt\r\nat moccasins, lined with plaited cedar bark: leggins are unknown,\r\neven to the women. Their ornaments are vermilion, a few beads, and\r\nshell necklaces. They rarely suffer from any disease but rheumatism,\r\nbrought on by living in the warm houses of the whites, and various\r\nconsequences of liver complaint, produced by overgorging: as with\r\nstrong constitutions generally, they either die at once or readily\r\nrecover. They dress wounds with pine gum after squeezing out the blood,\r\nand their medicine-men have the usual variety of savage nostrums. In\r\nthe more desert parts of the Territory they are exceedingly destitute.\r\nSouth of Cedar City, even ten years ago they had fields of wheat\r\nand corn of six acres each, and supported emigrants; some of them\r\ncultivate yearly along the stream-banks peas, beans, sweet potatoes,\r\nand squashes. They live upon the flesh of the bear, elk, antelope, dog,\r\nwolf, hare, snake, and lizard, besides crickets, grasshoppers, ants,\r\nand other vermin. The cactus leaf, piñon nut, and various barks; the\r\nseed of the bunch-grass and of the wheat or yellow grass, somewhat\r\nresembling rye; the rabbit-bush twigs, which are chewed, and various\r\nroots and tubers; the soft sego bulb, the rootlet of the cat-tail flag,\r\nand of the tule, which, when sun-dried and powdered to flour, keeps\r\nthrough the winter, and is palatable even to white men, conclude the\r\nlist of their dainties. When these fail they must steal or starve, and\r\nthe dilemma is easily solved, to the settler’s cost.\r\n\r\nThe Yutas in the vicinity of the larger white settlements continually\r\ndiminish; bands of 150 warriors are now reduced to 35. Some of the\r\nminor tribes in the southern part of the Territory, near New Mexico,\r\ncan scarcely show a single squaw, having traded them off for horses and\r\narms; they go about killing one another, and on kidnapping expeditions,\r\nwhich farther diminish the breed. The complaint which has devastated\r\nthe South Sea Islands rages around the City of the Saints, and extends\r\nto the Rio Virgen. In six months six squaws were shot by red Othellos\r\nfor yielding their virtue to the fascinations of tobacco, whisky, and\r\nblankets; the Lotharios were savage as well as civilized. The operation\r\nof courting is performed by wrapping a blanket round one’s beloved; if\r\nshe reciprocates, it is a sign of consent. A refusal in these lands is\r\noften a serious business; the warrior collects his friends, carries\r\noff the recusant fair, and, after subjecting her to the insults of all\r\nhis companions, espouses her. There is little of the shame which Pliny\r\nattributes to the “Barrus.” When a death takes place they wrap the body\r\nin a skin or hide, and drag it by the leg to a grave, which is heaped\r\nup with stones as a protection against wild beasts. They mourn till\r\nthe end of that moon, allow a month to elapse, and then resume their\r\nlamentations for another moon: the interval is gradually increased till\r\nthe grief ends. It is usual to make the dead man’s lodge appear as\r\ndesolate as possible.\r\n\r\nThe Yuta is less servile, and, consequently, has a higher ethnic status\r\nthan the African negro; he will not toil, and he turns at a kick or\r\na blow. The emigrant who addresses him in the usual phrase, “D--\r\nyour eyes, git out of the road or I’ll shoot you!” is pretty sure to\r\ncome to grief. Lately the Yutas demanded compensation for the use of\r\ntheir grass upon the Truckee River, when the emigrants fired, killing\r\nWanamuka the chief. After the death of two or three whites, Mayor\r\nOrmsby, of the militia at Carson Valley, took the field, was decoyed\r\ninto a kanyon by Indian cunning, and perished with all his men.\r\n\r\n  _To “Chokop’s” Pass. 8th October, 1860._\r\n\r\nThe morning was wasted in binding two loose tires upon their respective\r\nwheels; it was past noon before we were _en route_. We shook hands\r\ncordially with Uncle Billy, whose generosity--a virtue highly prized by\r\nthose who, rarely practicing, expect it to be practiced upon them--has\r\nwon for him the sobriquet of the “Big-hearted Father.” He had vainly,\r\nhowever, attempted to rescue my silver pen-holder, whose glitter was\r\ntoo much for Indian virtue. Our route lay over a long divide, cold but\r\nnot unpicturesque, a scene of light-tinted mountain mahogany, black\r\ncedar, pure snowy hill, and pink sky. After ten miles we reached the\r\nplace where the road forks; that to the right, passing through Pine\r\nValley, falls into the gravelly ford of the Humboldt River, distant\r\nfrom this point eighty to eighty-five miles. After surmounting the\r\nwater-shed we descended over bench-land into a raw and dreary plain, in\r\nwhich greasewood was more plentiful than sage-bush. “Huntingdon Valley”\r\nis traversed by Smith’s Fork, which flows northward to the Humboldt\r\nRiver; when we crossed it it was a mere rivulet. Our camping-ground\r\nwas at the farther end of the plain, under a Pass called after the\r\nchief Chokop; the kanyon emitted a cold draught like the breathing\r\ncaves of Kentucky. We alighted at a water near the entrance, and found\r\nbunch-grass, besides a little fuel. After two hours the wagon came up\r\nwith the stock, which was now becoming weary, and we had the usual\r\nsupper of dough, butter, and coffee. I should have slept comfortably\r\nenough upon a shovel and a layer of carpet-bags had not the furious\r\nsouth wind howled like the distant whooping of Indians.\r\n\r\n  _To the Wilderness again. 9th October._\r\n\r\nThe frosty night was followed by a thaw in the morning. We hastened\r\nto ascend Chokop’s Pass by a bad, steep dugway: it lies south of\r\n“Railroad Kanyon,” which is said to be nearly flat-soled. A descent\r\nled into “Moonshine,” called by the Yutas Pahannap Valley, and we saw\r\nwith pleasure the bench rising at the foot of the pass. The station is\r\nnamed Diamond Springs, from an eye of warm, but sweet and beautifully\r\nclear water bubbling up from the earth. A little below it drains\r\noff in a deep rushy ditch, with a gravel bottom, containing equal\r\nparts of comminuted shells: we found it an agreeable and opportune\r\nbath. Hard work had begun to tell upon the temper of the party.\r\nThe judge, who ever preferred monologue to dialogue, aweary of the\r\nrolling prairies and barren plains, the bald and rocky ridges, the\r\nmuddy flats, saleratus ponds, and sandy wastes, sighed monotonously\r\nfor the woodland shades and the rustling of living leaves near his\r\nPennsylvanian home. The marshal, with true Anglo-American impetuosity,\r\ncould not endure Paddy Kennedy’s “slow and shyure” style of travel;\r\nand after a colloquy, in which the holiest of words were freely used\r\nas adjectives, participles, and exclamations, offered to fight him\r\nby way of quickening his pace. The boys--four or five in number--ate\r\nfor breakfast a quarter of beef, as though they had been Kaffirs or\r\nEsquimaux, and were threatened with ration-cutting. The station folks\r\nwere Mormons, but not particularly civil: they afterward had to fly\r\nbefore the savages, which, perhaps, they will be pleased to consider a\r\n“judgment” upon them.\r\n\r\nShortly after noon we left Diamond Springs, and carried on for a\r\nstretch of seven miles to our lunching-ground, a rushy water, black\r\nwhere it overlies mud, and bluish-green where light gravel and shells\r\nform the bottom: the taste is sulphury, and it abounds in confervæ\r\nand animalculæ like leeches and little tadpoles. After playing a tidy\r\nbowie-knife, we remounted, and passed over to the rough divide lying\r\nwestward of Moonshine Valley. As night had closed in, we found some\r\ndifficulty in choosing a camping-place: at length we pitched upon a\r\nprairillon under the lee of a hill, where we had bunch-grass and fuel,\r\nbut no water. The wind blew sternly through the livelong night, and\r\nthose who suffered from cramps in cold feet had little to do with the\r\n“sweet restorer, balmy sleep.”\r\n\r\n  _To Sheawit Creek. 10th October._\r\n\r\n[SHEAWIT CREEK.]\r\n\r\nAt 6 A.M. the mercury was sunk only to 29° F., but the elevation and\r\nrapid evaporation, with the fierce gusty wind coursing through the\r\nkanyon, rendered the sensation of cold painful. As usual on these\r\noccasions, “George,” our chef, sensibly preferred standing over the\r\nfire, and enwrapping himself with smoke, to the inevitable exposure\r\nincurred while fetching a coffee-pot or a tea-kettle. A long divide,\r\nwith many ascents and descents, at length placed in front of us a view\r\nof the normal “distance”--heaps of hills, white as bridal cakes, and,\r\nnearer, a sand-like plain, somewhat more yellow than the average of\r\nthose salt-bottoms: instinct told us that there lay the station-house.\r\nFrom the hills rose the smokes of Indian fires: the lands belong to\r\nthe Tusawichya, or White-Knives, a band of the Shoshonees under an\r\nindependent chief. This depression is known to the Yutas as Sheawit, or\r\nWillow Creek: the whites call it, from Mr. Bolivar Roberts, the Western\r\nagent, “Roberts’ Springs Valley.” It lies 286 miles from Camp Floyd:\r\nfrom this point “Simpson’s Road” strikes off to the S.E., and as Mr.\r\nHoward Egan’s rule here terminates, it is considered the latter end of\r\nMormondom. Like all the stations to the westward, that is to say, those\r\nnow before us, it was burned down in the late Indian troubles, and has\r\nonly been partially rebuilt. One of the _employés_ was Mr. Mose Wright,\r\nof Illinois, who again kindly assisted me with correcting my vocabulary.\r\n\r\n[THE WHITE-KNIVES.]\r\n\r\nAbout the station loitered several Indians of the White-Knife tribe,\r\nwhich boasts, like the old Sioux and the modern Flatheads, never to\r\nhave stained its weapons with the blood of a white man. They may be\r\na respectable race, but they are an ugly: they resemble the Diggers,\r\nand the children are not a little like juvenile baboons. The dress\r\nwas the usual medley of rags and rabbit furs: they were streaked with\r\nvermilion; and their hair--contrary to, and more sensibly than the\r\npractice of our grandfathers--was fastened into a frontal pigtail, to\r\nprevent it falling into the eyes. These men attend upon the station\r\nand herd the stock for an occasional meal, their sole payment. They\r\nwill trade their skins and peltries for arms and gunpowder, but,\r\nAfrican-like, they are apt to look upon provisions, beads, and tobacco\r\nin the light of presents.\r\n\r\nA long march of thirty-five miles lay before us. Kennedy resolved to\r\npass the night at Sheawit Creek, and, despite their grumbling, sent on\r\nthe boys, the stock, and the wagons, when rested from their labor, in\r\nthe early afternoon. We spent a cosy, pleasant evening--such as I have\r\nenjoyed in the old Italian days before railroads--of travelers’ tittle\r\nand Munchausen tattle, in the ingle corner and round the huge hearth\r\nof the half-finished station, with its holey walls. At intervals, the\r\nroarings of the wind, the ticking of the death-watch (a well-known\r\nxylophagus), boring a home in the soft cotton-wood rafters, and the\r\nhowlings of the Indians, who were keening at a neighboring grave,\r\nformed a rude and appropriate chorus. Mose Wright recounted his early\r\nadventures in Oregon; how, when he was a greenhorn, the Indians had\r\ndanced the war-dance under his nose, had then set upon his companions,\r\nand, after slaying them, had displayed their scalps. He favored us\r\nwith a representation of the ceremony, an ursine performance--the bear\r\nseems every where to have been the sire of Terpsichore--while the right\r\nhand repeatedly clapped to his lips quavered the long loud howl into\r\nbroken sounds: “Howh! howh! howh! ow! ow! ough! ough! aloo! aloo! loo!\r\nloo! oo!” We talked of a curious animal, a breed between the dog and\r\nthe bear, which represents the semi-fabulous jumard in these regions:\r\nit is said to be a cross far more savage than that between the dog\r\nand the wolf. The young grizzly is a favorite pet in the Western hut,\r\nand a canine graft is hardly more monstrous than the progeny of the\r\nhorse and the deer lately exhibited in London. I still believe that in\r\nAfrica, and indeed in India, there are accidentally mules bimanous and\r\nquadrumanous, and would suggest that such specimens should be sought\r\nas the means of settling on a rational basis the genus and species of\r\n“homo sapiens.”\r\n\r\nMose Wright described the Indian arrow-poison. The rattlesnake--the\r\ncopperhead and the moccasin he ignored--is caught with a forked stick\r\nplanted over its neck, and is allowed to fix its fangs in an antelope’s\r\nliver. The meat, which turns green, is carried upon a skewer when\r\nwanted for use: the flint-head of an arrow, made purposely to break in\r\nthe wound, is thrust into the poison, and when withdrawn is covered\r\nwith a thin coat of glue. Ammonia is considered a cure for it, and the\r\nIndians treat snake-bites with the actual cautery. The rattlesnake\r\nhere attains a length of eight to nine feet, and is described as\r\nhaving reached the number of seventy-three rattles, which, supposing\r\n(as the theory is) that after the third year it puts forth one per\r\nannum, would raise its age to that of man: it is much feared in Utah\r\nTerritory. We were also cautioned against the poison oak, which is\r\nworse than the poison vine east of the Mississippi. It is a dwarf bush\r\nwith quercine leaves, dark colored and prickly like those of the holly:\r\nthe effect of a sting, of a touch, or, it is said, in sensitives of its\r\nproximity, is a painful itching, followed by a rash that lasts three\r\nweeks, and other highly inconvenient consequences. Strong brine was\r\nrecommended to us by our prairie doctor.\r\n\r\nAmong the _employés_ of the station was an intelligent young mechanic\r\nfrom Pennsylvania, who, threatened with consumption, had sought and\r\nsoon found health in the pure regions of the Rocky Mountains. He looked\r\nforward to revisiting civilization, where comforts were attainable. In\r\nthese wilds little luxuries like tea and coffee are often unprocurable;\r\na dudeen or a cutty pipe sells for a dollar, consequently a hollowed\r\npotato or corn-cob with a reed tube is often rendered necessary; and\r\ntobacco must be mixed with a myrtaceous leaf called by the natives\r\n“timaya,” and by the mountaineers “larb”--possibly a corruption of\r\n“l’herbe” or “la yerba.” Newspapers and magazines arrive sometimes\r\ntwice a year, when they have weathered the dangers of the way. Economy\r\nhas deprived the stations of their gardens, and the shrinking of\r\nemigration, which now dribbles eastward, instead of flowing in full\r\nstream westward, leaves the exiles to amuse themselves.\r\n\r\n  _To Dry Creek. 11th October._\r\n\r\n[ST. MARTIN’S SUMMER.--“DRY CREEK.”]\r\n\r\nWe arose early, and found that it had not “frosted;” that flies\r\nwere busy in the station-house; and that the snow, though thick on\r\nthe northern faces, had melted from the southern shoulders of the\r\nhills--these were so many indices of the St. Martin’s, or Indian\r\nsummer, the last warm glow of life before the cold and pallid death\r\nof the year. At 6 A.M. we entered the ambulance, and followed a good\r\nroad across the remains of the long, broad Sheawit Valley. After twelve\r\nmiles we came upon a water surrounded by willows, with dwarf artemisia\r\nbeyond--it grows better on the benches, where the subsoil is damper,\r\nthan in the bottoms--and there we found our lazy boys, who, as Jim\r\nGilston said, had been last night “on a drunk.” Resuming our way, after\r\nthree miles we reached some wells whose alkaline waters chap the skin.\r\nTwenty miles farther led to the west end of the Sheawit Valley, where\r\nwe found the station on a grassy bench at the foot of low rolling\r\nhills. It was a mere shell, with a substantial stone corral behind, and\r\nthe inmates were speculating upon the possibility of roofing themselves\r\nin before the winter. Water is found in tolerable quantities below the\r\nstation, but the place deserved its name, “Dry Creek.”\r\n\r\nA fraternal recognition took place between Long Jim and his brother,\r\nwho discovered each other by the merest accident. Gilston, the\r\n_employé_, was an intelligent man: at San Francisco he had learned a\r\nlittle Chinese, and at Deep Creek he was studying the Indian dialects.\r\nHe had missed making a fortune at Carson Valley, where, in June or\r\nJuly, 1859, the rich and now celebrated silver mines were discovered;\r\nand he warned us against the danger of tarrying in Carson City, where\r\nrevolvers are fired even into houses known to contain “ladies.” Colonel\r\nTotten, the station-master, explained the formation of the gold\r\ndiggings as beds of gravel, from one to 120 feet, overlying slate rock.\r\n\r\nDry-Creek Station is on the eastern frontier of the western agency; as\r\nat Roberts’ Creek, supplies and literature from Great Salt City east\r\nand Carson City west are usually exhausted before they reach these\r\nfinal points. After a frugal feed, we inspected a grave for two, which\r\nbore the names of Loscier and Applegate, and the date 21st of May.\r\nThese men, _employés_ of the station, were attacked by Indians--Panaks\r\nor Shoshonees, or possibly both: the former was killed by the first\r\nfire; the latter, when shot in the groin, and unable to proceed,\r\nborrowed, under pretext of defense, a revolver, bade good-by to his\r\ncompanions, and put a bullet through his own head: the remainder then\r\nescaped. Both these poor fellows remain unavenged. The Anglo-American,\r\nwho is admirably protected by the officials of his government in\r\nEurope, Asia, and Africa, is systematically neglected--_teste_\r\nMexico--in America. The double grave, piled up with stones, showed gaps\r\nwhere the wolves had attempted to tunnel, and blue-bottle flies were\r\nbuzzing over it in expectation. Colonel Totten, at our insistence,\r\npromised that it should be looked to.\r\n\r\nThe night was comfortably passed at Dry Creek, under the leeward side\r\nof a large haystack. The weather was cold, but clear and bright. We\r\nslept the sleep of the just.\r\n\r\n  _To Simpson’s Park. 12th October._\r\n\r\n[SIMPSON’S PARK.]\r\n\r\nAt the time of the cold clear dawn, whose gray contrasted strongly\r\nwith the blush of the most lovely evening that preceded it, the\r\nmercury stood at 45° F. Shortly after 8 A.M. we were afield, hastening\r\nto finish the long divide that separates Roberts’ Creek Valley from\r\nits western neighbor, which, as yet unchristened, is known to the\r\nb’hoys as Smoky Valley. The road wound in the shape of the letter U\r\nround the impassable part of the ridge. Crossing the north end of\r\nSmoky Valley, we came upon rolling ground, with water-willows and\r\ncedars “blazed”--barked with a gash--for sign-posts. Ensued a long\r\nkanyon, with a flat sole, not unlike Egan’s, a gate by which the swift\r\nshallow stream had broken through the mountains: in places it was\r\napparently a _cul de sac_; in others, shoulder after shoulder rose in\r\nlong perspective, with points and projections behind, which an enemy\r\nmight easily turn. The granite walls were of Cyclopean form, with\r\nregular lines of cleavage, as in the Rattlesnake Hills, which gave\r\na false air of stratification. The road was a mere path along and\r\nacross the rivulet bed, and the lower slopes were garnished with the\r\npepper-grass and the everlasting bunch-grass, so truly characteristic\r\nof the “Basin State.” Above us, in the pellucid sky, towered the eagle\r\nin his pride of place; the rabbit ran before us from the thicket; the\r\nground-squirrel cached himself in the sage-bush; and where distance\r\nappeared, smokes upcurling in slow, heavy masses told us that man was\r\nnot far distant. A second divide, more abrupt than the former, placed\r\nus in sight of Simpson’s Park--and such a park! a circlet of tawny\r\nstubble, embosomed in sage-grown hills, the “Hiré” or “Look-out,” and\r\nothers, without other tree but the deformed cedars. The bottom is\r\nnotorious for cold; it freezes even in June and July; and our night\r\nwas, as may be imagined, none of the pleasantest.\r\n\r\nThe station-house in Simpson’s Park was being rebuilt. As we issued\r\nfrom Mormondom into Christendom, the civility of our hosts perceptibly\r\ndiminished; the judge, like the generality of Anglo-Americans, did\r\nunnecessary kow-tow to those whom republicanism made his equals, and\r\nthe “gentlemen,” when asked to do any thing, became exceedingly surly.\r\nAmong them was one Giovanni Brutisch, a Venetian, who, flying from\r\nconscription, had found a home in Halifax: an unfortunate fire, which\r\nburned down his house, drove him to the Far West. He talked copiously\r\nof the Old Country, breathed the usual aspirations of _Italia una_,\r\nand thought that Garibaldi would do well “_se non lo molestano_”--a\r\neuphuism accompanied by a look more expressive than any nod. The\r\nstation was well provided with good miniés, and the men apparently\r\nexpected to use them; it was, however, commanded by the neighboring\r\nheights, and the haystacks were exposed to fire at a time of the year\r\nwhen no more forage could be collected. The Venetian made for us some\r\ngood light bread of wheaten flour, started or leavened with hop-water,\r\nand corn-bread “shortened” with butter, and enriched with two or three\r\neggs. A hideous Pa Yuta and surly Shoshonee, whom I sketched, loitered\r\nabout the station: they were dressed in the usual rabbit-skin cape, and\r\ncarried little horn bows, with which they missed small marks at fifteen\r\npaces. The boys, who were now aweary of watching, hired one of these\r\nmen for a shirt--tobacco was not to be had, and a blanket was too high\r\npay--to mount guard through the night. Like the Paggi or Ramoosee of\r\nWestern India, one thief is paid to keep off many: the Indian is the\r\nbest of wardens, it being with him a principle not to attack what the\r\npresence of a fellow-tribesman defends.\r\n\r\n  _To Reese’s River. 13th October._\r\n\r\nSimpson’s Park lies 195 miles from Carson City, where we might consider\r\nthe journey at an end; yet the cold of night did not allow us to set\r\nout before 10 A.M. Our route lay across the park, which was dotted\r\nwith wheat-grass and broom-like reeds rising from a ground saupoudré\r\nlike salt. Presently we began to ascend Simpson’s Pass, a long kanyon\r\nwhose sloping sides and benches were dotted with the green bunch-grass.\r\nAt the divide we found the “Sage Springs,” whose position is too\r\nelevated for the infiltration of salt: they are consequently sweet\r\nand wholesome. Descending by a rugged road, we sighted every where on\r\nthe heights the fires of the natives. They were not symbols of war,\r\nbut signals--for which smokes are eminently adapted--made by tribes\r\ntelegraphing to one another their being _en route_ for their winter\r\nquarters. Below us, “Reese’s River” Valley might have served for a\r\nsketch in the African desert: a plain of saleratus, here yellow with\r\nsand or hay, there black with fire, there brown where the skin of earth\r\nshowed through her garb of rags, and beyond it were chocolate-colored\r\nhills, from whose heads curled blue smokes of volcanic appearance.\r\n\r\nBisecting the barren plain ran a bright little stream, whose banks,\r\nhowever, had been stripped of their “salt grass:” pure and clear it\r\nflows over a bed of gravel, sheds in a northerly direction, and sinks\r\nat a distance of about twenty miles. From afar we all mistook the\r\ncourse, deceived, as travelers often are, by the horizontality of the\r\nlines. Leaving on the right the road which forks to the lower ford, we\r\nfollowed that on the left hand leading to the station. There can not be\r\nmuch traveling upon these lines: the tracks last for years, unaffected\r\nby snow: the carcasses of animals, however, no longer mummified as in\r\nthe Eastern prairies, are readily reduced to skeletons.\r\n\r\nThe station-house in the Reese-River Valley had lately been evacuated\r\nby its proprietors and burnt down by the Indians: a new building of\r\nadobe was already assuming a comfortable shape. The food around it\r\nbeing poor and thin, our cattle were driven to the mountains. At night,\r\nprobably by contrast with the torrid sun, the frost appeared colder\r\nthan ever: we provided against it, however, by burrowing into the\r\nhaystack, and, despite the jackal-like cry of the coyote and the near\r\ntramping of the old white mare, we slept like tops.\r\n\r\n  _To Smith’s Creek. 14th October._\r\n\r\nBefore 8 A.M. we were under way, bound for Smith’s Creek. Our path\r\nstretched over the remainder of Reese’s River Valley, an expanse of\r\nwhite sage and large rabbit-bush which affords fuel even when green.\r\nAfter a long and peculiarly rough divide, we sighted the place of our\r\ndestination. It lay beyond a broad plain or valley, like a huge white\r\n“splotch” in the centre, set in dirty brown vegetation, backed by bare\r\nand rugged hills, which are snow-topped only on the north; presently\r\nwe reached the “splotch,” which changed its aspect from that of a\r\nmuddy pool to a yellow floor of earth so hard that the wheels scarcely\r\nmade a dent, except where a later inundation had caused the mud to\r\ncake, flake, and curl--smooth as ice without being slippery. Beyond\r\nthat point, guided by streams meandering through willow-thickets, we\r\nentered a kanyon--all are now wearying of the name--and presently\r\nsighted the station deep in a hollow. It had a good stone corral and\r\nthe usual haystack, which fires on the hill-tops seemed to menace.\r\nAmong the station-folks we found two New Yorkers, a Belfast man, and\r\na tawny Mexican named Anton, who had passed his life riding the San\r\nBernardino road. The house was unusually neat, and displayed even signs\r\nof decoration in the adornment of the bunks with osier-work taken from\r\nthe neighboring creek. We are now in the lands of the Pa Yuta, and\r\nrarely fail to meet a party on the road: they at once propose “shwop,”\r\nand readily exchange pine nuts for “white grub,” _i. e._, biscuits. I\r\nobserved, however, that none of the natives were allowed to enter the\r\nstation-house, whereas in other places, especially among the Mormons,\r\nthe savages squeezed themselves into the room, took the best seats near\r\nthe fire, and never showed a symptom of moving.\r\n\r\n  _To Cold Springs. 15th October._\r\n\r\n[“OLE HELLION.”--COLD-SPRINGS STATION.]\r\n\r\nAfter a warmer night than usual--thanks to fire and lodging--we awoke,\r\nand found a genial south wind blowing. Our road lay through the kanyon,\r\nwhose floor was flush with the plain; the bed of the mountain stream\r\nwas the initiative of vile traveling, which, without our suspecting it,\r\nwas to last till the end of the journey. The strain upon the vehicle\r\ncame near to smashing it, and the prudent Kennedy, with the view of\r\nsparing his best animals, gave us his worst--two aged brutes, one of\r\nwhich, in consequence of her squealing habits, had won for herself the\r\ntitle of “ole Hellion.” The divortia aquarum was a fine water-shed\r\nto the westward, and the road was in V shape, whereas before it had\r\noscillated between U and WW. As we progressed, however, the valleys\r\nbecame more and more desert, the sage more stunted, and the hills more\r\nbrown and barren. After a midday halt, rendered compulsory by the\r\nold white mare, we resumed our way along the valley southward, over\r\na mixture of pitch-hole and boulder, which forbids me to forget that\r\nday’s journey. At last, after much sticking and kicking on the part\r\nof the cattle, and the mental refreshment of abundant bad language,\r\nself-adhibited by the men, we made Cold-Springs Station, which, by\r\nmeans of a cut across the hills, could be brought within eight miles of\r\nSmith’s Creek.\r\n\r\nThe station was a wretched place, half built and wholly unroofed; the\r\nfour boys, an exceedingly rough set, ate standing, and neither paper\r\nnor pencil was known among them. Our animals, however, found good water\r\nin a rivulet from the neighboring hills, and the promise of a plentiful\r\nfeed on the morrow, while the humans, observing that a “beef” had been\r\nfreshly killed, supped upon an excellent steak. The warm wind was a\r\npleasant contrast to the usual frost, but, as it came from the south,\r\nall the weather-wise predicted that rain would result. We slept,\r\nhowever, without such accident, under the haystack, and heard the loud\r\nhowling of the wolves, which are said to be larger on these hills than\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n  _To Sand Springs. 16th October._\r\n\r\nIn the morning the wind had shifted from the south to a more pluvial\r\nquarter, the southeast--in these regions the westerly wind promises\r\nthe fairest--and stormy cirri mottled the sky. We had a long stage of\r\nthirty-five miles before us, and required an early start, yet the lazy\r\nb’hoys and the weary cattle saw 10 A.M. before we were _en route_.\r\nSimpson’s road lay to our south; we could, however, sight, about two\r\nmiles distant from the station, the easternmost formation, which he\r\ncalls Gibraltar Gate. For the first three miles our way was exceedingly\r\nrough; it gradually improved into a plain cut with nullahs, and\r\novergrown with a chapparal, which concealed a few “burrowing hares.”\r\nThe animals are rare; during the snow they are said to tread in one\r\nanother’s trails after Indian fashion, yet the huntsman easily follows\r\nthem. After eight miles we passed a spring, and two miles beyond it\r\ncame to the Middle Gate, where we halted from noon till 5 15 P.M. Water\r\nwas found in the bed of a river which fills like a mill-dam after\r\nrain, and a plentiful supply of bunch-grass, whose dark seeds it was\r\ndifficult to husk out of the oat-like capsules. We spent our halt in\r\npracticing what Sorrentines call _la caccia degl’ uccelluzzi_, and\r\nin vain attempts to walk round the uncommonly wary hawks, crows, and\r\nwolves.\r\n\r\nHitching to as the sun neared the western horizon, we passed through\r\nthe Gate, narrowly escaping a “spill” down a dwarf precipice. A plain\r\nbounded on our left by cretaceous bluffs, white as snow, led to the\r\nWest Gate, two symmetrical projections like those farther eastward.\r\nAfter that began a long divide broken by frequent chuck-holes, which,\r\nhowever, had no cunette at the bottom. An ascent of five miles led\r\nto a second broad basin, whose white and sounding ground, now stony,\r\nthen sandy, scattered over with carcass and skeleton, was bounded in\r\nfront by low dark ranges of hill. Then crossing a long rocky divide, so\r\nwinding that the mules’ heads pointed within a few miles to N., S., E.,\r\nand W., we descended by narrow passes into a plain. The eye could not\r\ndistinguish it from a lake, so misty and vague were its outlines: other\r\nsenses corrected vision, when we sank up to the hub in the loose sand.\r\nAs we progressed painfully, broken clay and dwarf vegetation assumed in\r\nthe dim shades fantastic and mysterious forms. I thought myself once\r\nmore among the ruins of that Arab village concerning which Lebid sang,\r\n\r\n    “Ay me! ay me! all lone and drear the dwelling-place, the home--\r\n    On Mina, o’er Rijam and Ghool, wild beasts unheeded roam.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRST VIEW OF CARSON LAKE.]\r\n\r\nTired out and cramped with cold, we were torpid with what the Bedouin\r\ncalls El Rakl--la Ragle du Désert, when part of the brain sleeps while\r\nthe rest is wide awake. At last, about 2 30 A.M., thoroughly “knocked\r\nup”--a phrase which I should advise the Englishman to eschew in the\r\nsociety of the fair Columbian--we sighted a roofless shed, found a\r\nhaystack, and, reckless of supper or of stamping horses, fell asleep\r\nupon the sand.\r\n\r\n  _To Carson Lake. 17th October._\r\n\r\n[SAND-SPRINGS STATION.]\r\n\r\nSand-Springs Station deserved its name. Like the Brazas de San Diego\r\nand other _mauvaises terres_ near the Rio Grande, the land is cumbered\r\nhere and there with drifted ridges of the finest sand, sometimes 200\r\nfeet high, and shifting before every gale. Behind the house stood a\r\nmound shaped like the contents of an hour-glass, drifted up by the\r\nstormy S.E. gale in esplanade shape, and falling steep to northward or\r\nagainst the wind. The water near this vile hole was thick and stale\r\nwith sulphury salts: it blistered even the hands. The station-house was\r\nno unfit object in such a scene, roofless and chairless, filthy and\r\nsqualid, with a smoky fire in one corner, and a table in the centre of\r\nan impure floor, the walls open to every wind, and the interior full of\r\ndust. Hibernia herself never produced aught more characteristic. Of the\r\n_employés_, all loitered and sauntered about _désœuvrés_ as cretins,\r\nexcept one, who lay on the ground crippled and apparently dying by the\r\nfall of a horse upon his breast-bone.\r\n\r\n[CARSON LAKE.]\r\n\r\nAbout 11 A.M. we set off to cross the ten miles of valley that\r\nstretched between us and the summit of the western divide still\r\nseparating us from Carson Lake. The land was a smooth saleratus plain,\r\nwith curious masses of porous red and black basalt protruding from\r\na ghastly white. The water-shed was apparently to the north, the\r\nbenches were distinctly marked, and the bottom looked as if it were\r\ninundated every year. It was smooth except where broken up by tracks,\r\nbut all off the road was dangerous ground: in one place the horses\r\nsank to their hocks, and were not extricated without difficulty. After\r\na hot drive--the glass at 9 A.M. showed 74° F.--we began to toil up\r\nthe divide, a sand formation mixed with bits of granite, red seeds,\r\nand dwarf shells, whose lips were for the most part broken off. Over\r\nthe fine loose surface was a floating haze of the smaller particles,\r\nlike the film that veils the Arabian desert. Arrived at the summit,\r\nwe sighted for the first time Carson Lake, or rather the sink of the\r\nCarson River. It derives its name from the well-known mountaineer\r\nwhose adventurous roamings long anticipated scientific exploration.\r\nSupplied by the stream from the eastern flank of the Sierra Nevada, it\r\nis just such a lake as might be formed in any of the basins which we\r\nhad traversed--a shallow sheet of water, which, in the cloudy sky and\r\nmitigated glare of the sun, looked pale and muddy. Apparently it was\r\ndivided by a long, narrow ruddy line, like ochre-colored sand; a near\r\napproach showed that water on the right was separated from a saleratus\r\nbed on the left by a thick bed of tule rush. Stones imitated the sweep\r\nof the tide, and white particles the color of a wash.\r\n\r\nOur conscientious informant at Sand-Springs Station had warned us that\r\nupon the summit of the divide we should find a perpendicular drop, down\r\nwhich the wagons could be lowered only by means of lariats affixed\r\nto the axle-trees and lashed round strong “stubbing-posts.” We were\r\nnot, however, surprised to find a mild descent of about 30°. From the\r\nsummit of the divide five miles led us over a plain too barren for\r\nsage, and a stretch of stone and saleratus to the watery margin, which\r\nwas troublesome with sloughs and mud. The cattle relished the water,\r\nalthough tainted by the rush; we failed, however, to find any of the\r\nfresh-water clams, whose shells were scattered along the shore.\r\n\r\nRemounting at 5 15 P.M. we proceeded to finish the ten miles which\r\nstill separated us from the station, by a rough and stony road,\r\nperilous to wheel conveyances, which rounded the southern extremity of\r\nthe lake. After passing a promontory whose bold projection had been\r\nconspicuous from afar, and threading a steep kanyon leading toward\r\nthe lake, we fell into its selvage, which averaged about one mile in\r\nbreadth. The small crescent of the moon soon ceased to befriend us, and\r\nwe sat in the sadness of the shade, till presently a light glimmered\r\nunder Arcturus, the road bent toward it, and all felt “jolly.” But,\r\n\r\n    “Heu, heu! nos miseros, quam totus homuncio nil est!”\r\n\r\nA long dull hour still lay before us, and we were approaching civilized\r\nlands. “Sink Station” looked well from without; there was a frame house\r\ninside an adobe inclosure, and a pile of wood and a stout haystack\r\npromised fuel and fodder. The inmates, however, were asleep, and it\r\nwas ominously long before a door was opened. At last appeared a surly\r\ncripple, who presently disappeared to arm himself with his revolver.\r\nThe judge asked civilly for a cup of water; he was told to fetch it\r\nfrom the lake, which was not more than a mile off, though, as the\r\nroad was full of quagmires, it would be hard to travel at night. Wood\r\nthe churl would not part with: we offered to buy it, to borrow it,\r\nto replace it in the morning; he told us to go for it ourselves, and\r\nthat after about two miles and a half we might chance to gather some.\r\nCertainly our party was a law-abiding and a self-governing one; never\r\ndid I see men so tamely bullied; they threw back the fellow’s sticks,\r\nand cold, hungry, and thirsty, simply began to sulk. An Indian standing\r\nby asked $20 to herd the stock for a single night. At last, George\r\nthe Cordon Blue took courage; some went for water, others broke up a\r\nwagon-plank, and supper after a fashion was concocted.\r\n\r\nI preferred passing the night on a side of bacon in the wagon to\r\nusing the cripple’s haystack, and allowed sleep to steep my senses in\r\nforgetfulness, after deeply regretting that the Mormons do not extend\r\nsomewhat farther westward.\r\n\r\n  _To Fort Churchill. 18th October._\r\n\r\n[FORT CHURCHILL.]\r\n\r\nThe b’hoys and the stock were doomed to remain near the Carson Lake,\r\nwhere forage was abundant, while we made our way to Carson Valley--an\r\narrangement not effected without excessive grumbling. At last the\r\ndeserted ones were satisfied with the promise that they should exchange\r\ntheir desert quarters for civilization on Tuesday, and we were\r\npermitted to start. Crossing a long plain bordering on the Sink, we\r\n“snaked up” painfully a high divide which a little engineering skill\r\nwould have avoided. From the summit, bleak with west wind, we could\r\ndescry, at a distance of fifty miles, a snowy saddle-back--the Sierra\r\nNevada. When the deep sand had fatigued our cattle, we halted for an\r\nhour to bait in a patch of land rich with bunch-grass. Descending from\r\nthe eminence, we saw a gladdening sight: the Carson River, winding\r\nthrough its avenue of dark cotton-woods, and afar off the quarters and\r\nbarracks of Fort Churchill. The nearer view was a hard-tamped plain,\r\nbesprinkled with black and red porous stones and a sparse vegetation,\r\nwith the ruddy and yellow autumnal hues; a miserable range of low,\r\nbrown, sunburnt rocks and hills, whose ravines were choked with white\r\nsand-drifts, bounded the basin. The farther distance used it as a foil;\r\nthe Sierra developed itself into four distinct magnificent tiers of\r\nsnow-capped and cloud-veiled mountain, whose dissolving views faded\r\ninto thin darkness as the sun disappeared behind their gigantic heads.\r\n\r\n[FIGHTING LAWYERS.]\r\n\r\nWhile we admired these beauties night came on; the paths intersected\r\none another, and, despite the glow and gleam of a camp-fire in the\r\ndistance, we lost our way among the tall cotton-woods. Dispersing in\r\nsearch of information, the marshal accidentally stumbled upon his\r\npredecessor in office, Mr. Smith, who hospitably insisted upon our\r\nbecoming his guests. He led us to a farm-house already half roofed\r\nin against the cold, fetched the whisky for which our souls craved,\r\ngave to each a peach that we might be good boys, and finally set\r\nbefore us a prime beefsteak. Before sleeping we heard a number of\r\n“shooting stories.” Where the corpse is, says the Persian, there will\r\nbe the kites. A mining discovery never fails to attract from afar a\r\nflock of legal vultures--attorneys, lawyers, and judges. As the most\r\nvaluable claims are mostly parted with by the ignorant fortunate for a\r\nsong, it is usual to seek some flaw in the deed of sale, and a large\r\nproportion of the property finds its way into the pockets of the acute\r\nprofessional, who works on half profits. Consequently, in these parts\r\nthere is generally a large amount of unscrupulous talent. One gentleman\r\njudge had knived a waiter and shot a senator; another, almost as “heavy\r\n_on_ the shyoot,” had in a single season killed one man and wounded\r\nanother. My informants declared that in and about Carson a dead man\r\nfor breakfast was the rule; besides accidents perpetually occurring to\r\nindifferent or to peace-making parties, they reckoned per annum fifty\r\nmurders. In a peculiar fit of liveliness, an intoxicated gentleman\r\nwill discharge his revolver in a ballroom, and when a “shyooting”\r\nbegins in the thin-walled frame houses, those not concerned avoid\r\nbullets and splinters by jumping into their beds. During my three\r\ndays’ stay at Carson City I heard of three murders. A man “heavy _on_\r\nthe shoulder,” who can “hit out straight from the hip,” is a valuable\r\nacquisition. The gambler or professional player, who in the Eastern\r\nStates is exceptionably peaceful, because he fears the publicity of a\r\nquarrel, here must distinguish himself as a fighting-man. A curious\r\nstory was told to illustrate how the ends of justice might, at a pinch,\r\nin the case of a popular character, be defeated. A man was convicted\r\nof killing his adversary after saying to the by-standers, “Stoop down\r\nwhile I shoot the son of a dog (female).” Counsel for the people showed\r\n_malice prepense_; counsel for defense pleaded that his client was\r\n_rectus in curia_, and manifestly couldn’t mean a man, but a dog. The\r\njudge ratified the verdict of acquittal.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of things, realizing the old days of the Californian\r\ngold-diggings, when I visited in 1860 Carson City. Its misrule, or\r\nrather want of rule, has probably long since passed away, leaving\r\nno more traces than a dream. California has been transformed by her\r\nVigilance Committee, so ignorantly and unjustly declaimed against\r\nin Europe and in the Eastern States of the Union, from a savage\r\nautonomy to one of the most orderly of the American republics, and San\r\nFrancisco, her capital, from a den of thieves and prostitutes, gamblers\r\nand miners, the offscourings of nations, to a social status not\r\ninferior to any of the most favored cities.\r\n\r\n  _Hurrah again--in! 19th October._\r\n\r\nThis day will be the last of my diary. We have now emerged from the\r\ndeserts of the Basin State, and are debouching upon lands where coaches\r\nand the electric telegraph ply.\r\n\r\nAfter a cold night at the hospitable Smith’s, and losing the cattle,\r\nwe managed to hitch to, and crossed, not without difficulty, the deep\r\nbed of the Carson River, which runs over sands glittering with mica.\r\nA little beyond it we found the station-house, and congratulated\r\nourselves that we had escaped a twelve hours’ durance vile in its\r\natmosphere of rum, korn schnapps, stale tobacco, flies, and profane\r\noaths, not to mention the chance of being “wiped out” in a “difference”\r\nbetween a soldier and a gambler, or a miner and a rider.\r\n\r\n[FORT CHURCHILL.]\r\n\r\nFrom the station-house we walked, accompanied by a Mr. O.--who,\r\nafter being an editor in Texas, had become a mail-rider in Utah\r\nTerritory--to the fort. It was, upon the principle of its eastern\r\nneighbors, a well-disposed cantonment, containing quarters for the\r\nofficers and barracks for the men. Fort Churchill had been built\r\nduring the last few months: it lodged about two companies of infantry,\r\nand required at least 2000 men. Captain F. F. Flint (6th Regiment)\r\nwas then commanding, and Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Swords, a deputy\r\nquarter-master general, was on a tour of inspection. We went straight\r\nto the quarter-master’s office, and there found Lieutenant Moore, who\r\nintroduced us to all present, and supplied us with the last newspapers\r\nand news. The camp was Teetotalist, and avoided cards like good\r\nMoslems: we were not, however, expected to drink water except in the\r\nform of strong waters, and the desert had disinclined us to abstain\r\nfrom whisky. Finally, Mr. Byrne, the sutler, put into our ambulance a\r\nsubstantial lunch, with a bottle of cocktail, and another of cognac,\r\nespecially intended to keep the cold out.\r\n\r\nThe dull morning had threatened snow, and shortly after noon the west\r\nwind brought up cold heavy showers, which continued with intervals to\r\nthe end of the stage. Our next station was Miller’s, distant 15 to 16\r\nmiles. The road ran along the valley of Carson River, whose trees were\r\na repose to our eyes, and we congratulated ourselves when we looked\r\ndown the stiff clay banks, 30 feet high, and wholly unfenced, that\r\nour journey was by day. The desert was now “done.” At every few miles\r\nwas a drinking “calaboose:”[233] where sheds were not a kettle hung\r\nunder a tree, and women peeped out of the log huts. They were probably\r\nnot charming, but, next to a sea voyage, a desert march is the finest\r\ncosmetic ever invented. We looked upon each as if\r\n\r\n    “Her face was like the Milky Way i’ the sky,\r\n      A meeting of gentle lights without a name.”\r\n\r\n  [233] The Spanish is calabozo, the French calabouse. In the\r\n  Hispano-American countries it is used as a “common jail” or a\r\n  “dog-hole,” and, as usual, is converted into a verb.\r\n\r\nAt Miller’s Station, which we reached at 2 30 P.M., there really was\r\none pretty girl--which, according to the author of the Art of Pluck,\r\ninduces proclivity to temulency. While the rain was heavy we sat\r\nround the hot stove, eating bread and cheese, sausages and anchovies,\r\nwhich Rabelais, not to speak of other honest drinkers, enumerates\r\namong provocatives to thirst. When we started at 4 P.M. through the\r\ncold rain, along the bad road up the river bed, to “liquor up” was\r\nmanifestly a duty we owed to ourselves. And, finally, when my impatient\r\ncompanions betted a supper that we should reach Carson City before 9\r\nP.M., and sealed it with a “smile,” I knew that the only way to win was\r\nto ply Mr. Kennedy, the driver, with as many _pocula_ as possible.\r\n\r\nColder waxed the weather and heavier the rain as, diverging from the\r\nriver, we ascended the little bench upon which China-town lies. The\r\nline of ranches and frame houses, a kind of length-without-breadth\r\nplace, once celebrated in the gold-digging days, looked dreary and grim\r\nin the evening gloom. At 5 30 P.M. we were still fourteen miles distant\r\nfrom our destination. The benches and the country round about had been\r\nturned topsy-turvy in the search for precious metal, and the soil was\r\nstill burrowed with shaft and tunnel, and crossed at every possible\r\nspot by flumes, at which the natives of the Flowery Land still found\r\nit worth their while to work. Beyond China-town we quitted the river,\r\nand in the cold darkness of night we slowly began to breast the steep\r\nascent of a long divide.\r\n\r\nWe had been preceded on the way by a young man, driving in a light\r\ncart a pair of horses, which looked remarkable by the side of the\r\nusual Californian teams, three pair with the near wheeler ridden.\r\nArriving at a bad place, he kindly called out to us, but before his\r\nwarning could be taken a soft and yielding sensation, succeeded by a\r\ndecided leaning to the right, and ending with a loud crash, announced\r\nan overturn. In due time we were extricated, the pieces were picked\r\nup, and, though the gun was broken, the bottle of cocktail fortunately\r\nremained whole. The judge, probably and justly offended by my evil\r\nhabit of laughing out of season, informed us that he had never been\r\nthrown before, an announcement which made us expect more “spills.” The\r\nunhappy Kennedy had jumped off before the wheels pointed up hill; he\r\nhad not lost a hoof, it is true, on the long march, but he wept spirits\r\nand water at the disappointing thought that the ambulance, this time\r\ndrawn by his best team, and laden with all the dignities, had come to\r\ngrief, and would not be fit to be seen. After 100 yards more another\r\nsimilar series of sensations announced a repetition of the scene, which\r\ndeserved the epitaph,\r\n\r\n    “Hic jacet amphora vini.”\r\n\r\nThis time, however, falling down a bank, we “came to smash;” the\r\nbottle (eheu!) was broken, so was the judge’s head, while the ear of\r\nthe judgeling--serve him right for chaffing!--was cut, the pistols and\r\npowder-flasks were half buried in the sand, a variety of small objects\r\nwere lost, and the flying gear of the ambulance was a perfect wreck.\r\nUnwilling to risk our necks by another trial, we walked over the rest\r\nof the rough ground, and, conducted by the good Croly, found our way\r\nto “Dutch Nick’s,” a ranch and tavern apparently much frequented by\r\nthe teamsters and other roughs, who seemed, honest fellows! deeply to\r\nregret that the accident had not been much more serious.\r\n\r\nRemounting after a time, we sped forward, and sighted in front a\r\ndark line, but partially lit up about the flanks, with a brilliant\r\nillumination in the centre, the Kursaal of Mr. Hopkins, the local\r\nCrockford. Our entrance to Penrod House, the Fifth Avenue of Carson\r\nCity, was by no means of a triumphal order; Nature herself seemed\r\nto sympathize with us, besplashing us with tears heavier than Mr.\r\nKennedy’s. But after a good supper and change of raiment, a cigar,\r\n“something warm,” and the certainty of a bed, combined to diffuse over\r\nour minds the calm satisfaction of having surmounted our difficulties\r\n_tant bien que mal_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIRGINIA CITY. (From the Northeast.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\n[CONCLUSION.]\r\n\r\nThe traveler and the lecturer have apparently laid down a law that,\r\nwhether the journey does or does not begin at home, it should always\r\nend at that “hallowed spot.” Unwilling to break through what is now\r\nbecoming a time-honored custom, I trespass upon the reader’s patience\r\nfor a few pages more, and make my final _salaam_ in the muddy-puddly\r\nstreets, under the gusty, misty sky of the “Liverpool of the South.”\r\n\r\nAfter a day’s rest at Carson City, employed in collecting certain\r\nnecessaries of tobacco and raiment, which, intrinsically vile, were\r\nabout treble the price of the best articles of their kind in the\r\nBurlington Arcade, I fell in with Captain Dall, superintendent of the\r\nOphir mines, for whom I bore a recommendation from Judge Crosby, of\r\nUtah Territory. The valuable silver leads of Virginia City occupied\r\nme, under the guidance of that hospitable gentleman, two days, and on\r\nthe third we returned to Carson City, _viâ_ the Steam-boat Springs,\r\nWashoe Valley, and other local lions. On the 24th appeared the boys\r\ndriving in the stock from Carson Lake: certain of these youths had\r\ndisappeared; Jim Gilston, who had found his brother at Dry-Creek\r\nStation, had bolted, of course forgetting to pay his passage. A\r\nstage-coach, most creditably horsed, places the traveler from Carson\r\nCity at San Francisco in two days; as Mr. Kennedy, however, wished to\r\nsee me safely to the end, and the judge, esteeming me a fit Mentor\r\nfor youth, had intrusted to me Telemachus, alias Thomas, his son, I\r\nresolved to cross the Sierra by easy stages. After taking kindly leave\r\nof and a last “liquor up” with my old _compagnons de voyage_, the judge\r\nand the marshal, we broke ground once more on the 25th of October. At\r\nGenoa, pronounced Ge-nóa, the county town, built in a valley thirteen\r\nmiles south of Carson, I met Judge Cradlebaugh, who set me right on\r\ngrounds where the Mormons had sown some prejudices. Five days of a very\r\ndilatory travel placed us on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada;\r\nthe dugways and zigzags reminded me of the descriptions of travelers\r\nover the Andes; the snow threatened to block up the roads, and our\r\ndays and nights were passed among teamsters _en route_ and in the\r\nframe-house inn. On the 30th of November, reaching Diamond Springs, I\r\nwas advised by a Londoner, Mr. George Fryer, of the “Boomerang Saloon,”\r\nto visit the gold diggings at Placerville, whither a coach was about to\r\nstart. At “Hangtown,” as the place was less euphoniously termed, Mr.\r\nCollum, of the Cary House, kindly put me through the gold washing and\r\n“hydraulicking,” and Dr. Smith, an old East Indian practitioner, and\r\nMr. White, who had collected some fine specimens of minerals, made\r\nthe evenings pleasant. I started on the 1st of November by coach to\r\nFolsom, and there found the railroad, which in two hours conducts to\r\nSacramento: the negro coachmen driving hacks and wagons to the station,\r\nthe whistling of the steam, and the hurry of the train, struck me by\r\nthe contrast with the calm travel of the desert.\r\n\r\nAt Sacramento, the newer name for New Helvetia--a capital mass of\r\nshops and stores, groggeries and hotels--I cashed a draught, settled\r\nold scores with Kennedy, who almost carried me off by force to his\r\nlocation, shook hands with Thomas, and transferred myself from the\r\nGolden Eagle on board the steamer Queen City. Eight hours down the\r\nSacramento River, past Benicia--the birthplace of the Boy--in the dark\r\nto the head-waters of the glorious bay, placed me at the “El Dorada of\r\nthe West,” where a tolerable opera, a superior supper, and the society\r\nof friends made the arrival exceptionably comfortable.\r\n\r\nI spent ten pleasant days at San Francisco. There remained some\r\ntraveler’s work to be done: the giant trees, the Yosemite or Yohamite\r\nFalls--the highest cataracts yet known in the world--and the Almaden\r\ncinnabar mines, with British Columbia, Vancouver’s Island, and Los\r\nAngelos temptingly near. But, in sooth, I was aweary of the way; for\r\neight months I had lived on board steamers and railroad cars, coaches\r\nand mules; my eyes were full of sight-seeing, my pockets empty, and\r\nmy brain stuffed with all manner of useful knowledge. It was far more\r\ngrateful to _flaner_ about the stirring streets, to admire the charming\r\nfaces, to enjoy the delicious climate, and to pay quiet visits like a\r\n“ladies’ man,” than to front wind and rain, muddy roads, _arrieros_,\r\nand rough teamsters, fit only for Rembrandt, and the solitude of\r\nout-stations. The presidential election was also in progress, and I\r\nwished to see with my eyes the working of a system which has been\r\nfacetiously called “universal suffering and vote by bullet.” Mr. Consul\r\nBooker placed my name on the lists of the Union Club, which was a\r\nsuperior institution to that of Leamington; Colonel Hooker, of Oregon,\r\nand Mr. Tooney, showed me life in San Francisco; Mr. Gregory Yale,\r\nwhom I had met at Carson City, introduced me to a quiet picture of old\r\nSpanish happiness, fast fading from California; Mr. Donald Davidson, an\r\nold East Indian, talked East Indian with me; and Lieutenants Macpherson\r\nand Brewer accompanied me over the forts and batteries which are\r\nintended to make of San Francisco a New-World Cronstadt. Mr. Polonius\r\nsensibly refused to cash for me a draught not authorized by my circular\r\nletter from the Union Bank. Mr. Booker took a less prudential and\r\nmercantile view of the question, and kindly helped me through with the\r\n_necessaire_--£100. My return for all this kindness was, I regret to\r\nsay, a temperate but firm refusal to lecture upon the subject of Meccah\r\nand El Medinah, Central Africa, Indian cotton, American politics, or\r\nevery thing in general. I nevertheless bade my adieux to San Francisco\r\nand the hospitable San Franciscans with regret.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of November, the Golden Age, Commodore Watkins, steamed out\r\nof the Golden Gates, bearing on board, among some 520 souls, the body\r\nthat now addresses the public. She was a model steamer, with engines\r\nand engine-rooms clean as a club kitchen, and a cuisine whose terrapin\r\nsoup and deviled crabs à la Baltimore will long maintain their position\r\nin my memory--not so long, however, as the kindness and courtesy of\r\nthe ancient mariner who commanded the Golden Age. On the 28th we spent\r\nthe best part of a night at Acapulco, the city of Cortez and of Doña\r\nMarina, where any lurking project of passing through ill-conditioned\r\nMexico was finally dispelled. The route from Acapulco to Vera Cruz,\r\nover a once well-worn highway, was simply and absolutely impassable.\r\nEach sovereign and independent state in that miserable caricature of\r\nthe Anglo-American federal Union was at daggers drawn with all and\r\nevery of its next-door neighbors; the battles were paper battles,\r\nbut the plundering and the barbarities--cosas de Mejico!--were stern\r\nrealities. A rich man could not travel because of the banditti; a poor\r\nman would have been enlisted almost outside the city gates; a man\r\nwith many servants would have seen half of them converted to soldiers\r\nunder his eyes, and have lost the other half by desertion, while a\r\nman without servants would have been himself press-gang’d; a Liberal\r\nwould have been murdered by the Church, and a Churchman--even the frock\r\nis no protection--would have been martyred by the Liberal party. For\r\nthis disappointment I found a philosophical consolation in various\r\nexperiments touching the influence of Mezcal brandy, the Mexican\r\nnational drink, upon the human mind and body.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of December we debarked at Panama; horridly wet, dull,\r\nand dirty was the “place of fish,” and the “Aspinwall House” and\r\nits Mivart reminded me of a Parsee hotel in the fort, Bombay. Yet I\r\nmanaged to spend there three pleasant circlings of the sun. A visit\r\nto the acting consul introduced me to M. Hurtado, the Intendente or\r\nmilitary governor, and to a charming countrywoman, whose fascinating\r\nsociety made me regret that my stay there could not be protracted.\r\nThough politics were running high, I became acquainted with most of the\r\nofficers of the United States squadron, and only saw the last of them\r\nat Colon, alias Aspinwall. Messrs. Boyd and Power, of the “Weekly Star\r\nand Herald,” introduced me to the officials of the Panama Railroad,\r\nMessrs. Nelson, Center, and others, who, had I not expressed an\r\naversion to “dead-headism,” or gratis traveling, would have offered me\r\na free passage. Last, but not least, I must mention the venerable name\r\nof Mrs. Seacole, of Jamaica and Balaklava.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of December I passed over the celebrated Panama Railway to\r\nAspinwall, where Mr. Center, the superintendent of the line, made\r\nthe evening highly agreeable with conversation aided by “Italia,” a\r\ncertain muscatel cognac that has yet to reach Great Britain. We steamed\r\nthe next morning, under charge of Captain Leeds, over the Caribbean\r\nSea or Spanish Main, bound for St. Thomas. A hard-hearted E.N.E. wind\r\nprotracted the voyage of the Solent for six days, and we reached the\r\nDanish settlement in time, and only just in time, to save a week’s\r\ndelay upon that offensive scrap of negro liberty-land. On the 9th of\r\nDecember we bade adieu with pleasure to the little dungeon-rock, and\r\nturned the head of the good ship Seine, Captain Rivett, toward the\r\nWestern Islands. She played a pretty wheel till almost within sight\r\nof Land’s End, where Britannia received us with her characteristic\r\nwelcome, a gale and a pea-soup fog, which kept us cruising about for\r\nthree days in the unpleasant Solent and the Southampton Water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN THE SIERRA NEVADA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDICES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.

DESCRIPTION OF THE MORMON TEMPLE.\r\n\r\n[_Extracted from the Deserét News._]\r\n\r\nThe following is a brief detail of the temple, taken from drawings in\r\nmy office in Great Salt Lake City.\r\n\r\nThe Temple Block is 40 rods square, the lines running north and south,\r\neast and west, and contains 10 acres. The centre of the temple is 156\r\nfeet 6 inches due west from the centre of the east line of the block.\r\nThe length of said house east and west is 186¹⁄₂ feet, including\r\ntowers, and the width 99 feet. On the east end there are three towers,\r\nas also on the west. Draw a line north and south 118¹⁄₂ feet through\r\nthe centre of the tower, and you have the north and south extent of\r\nground-plan, including pedestal.\r\n\r\nWe depress into the earth at the east end to the depth of 16 feet, and\r\nenlarge all around beyond the lines of wall 3 feet for a footing. The\r\nnorth and south walls are 8 feet thick clear of pedestal; they stand\r\nupon a footing of 16 feet wall on its bearing, which slopes 3 feet on\r\neach side to the height of 7¹⁄₂ feet. The footing of the towers rise to\r\nthe same height as the side, and is one solid piece of masonry of rough\r\nashlars, laid in good lime mortar.\r\n\r\nThe basement of the main building is divided into many rooms by walls,\r\nall having footings. The line of the basement floor is 6 inches above\r\nthe top of the footing. From the towers on the east to the towers on\r\nthe west, the face of the earth slopes 6 feet; 4 inches above the\r\nearth on the east line begins a promenade walk from 11 to 22 feet wide\r\naround the entire building, and approached by stone steps as the earth\r\nslopes and requires them. There are four towers on the four corners\r\nof the building, each starting from their footing of 26 feet square;\r\nthese continue 16¹⁄₂ feet high, and come to the line of the base string\r\ncourse, which is 8 feet above the promenade walk. At this point the\r\ntowers are reduced to 25 feet square; they then continue to the height\r\nof 38 feet, or the height of the second string course. At this point\r\nthey are reduced to 23 feet square; they then continue 38 feet high to\r\nthe third string course. The string courses continue all around the\r\nbuilding, except when separated by buttresses. These string courses are\r\nmassive mouldings from solid blocks of stone.\r\n\r\nThe two east towers then rise 25 feet to a string course or cornice.\r\nThe two west towers rise 19 feet, and come to their string course or\r\ncornice. The four towers then rise 9 feet to the top of battlements.\r\nThese towers are cylindrical, having 17 feet diameter inside, within\r\nwhich stairs ascend around a solid column 4 feet in diameter, allowing\r\nlandings at the various sections of the building. These towers have\r\neach five ornamental windows on two sides above the basement. The\r\ntwo centre towers occupy the centre of the east and west ends of the\r\nbuilding, starting from their footings 31 feet square, and break off\r\nin sections in line with corner towers, to the height of the third\r\nstring course. The east centre tower then rises 40 feet to the top\r\nof battlements; the west centre tower rises 34 feet to the top of\r\nbattlements. All these towers have spires; the east centre tower rises\r\n200 feet, while the west centre tower rises 190 feet. All these towers\r\nat their corners have octagon turrets, terminated by octagon pinnacles\r\n5 feet diameter at base, 4 feet at first story, and three feet from\r\nthere up. There are also on each side of these towers two buttresses,\r\nexcept where they come in contact with the body of the main building.\r\nThe top of these buttresses show forty-eight in number, and stand upon\r\npedestals. The space between the buttresses and turrets is 2 feet at\r\nthe first story. On the front of the two centre towers are two large\r\nwindows, each 32 feet high, one above the other, neatly prepared for\r\nthat place.\r\n\r\nOn the two west corner towers, and on the west end a few feet below the\r\ntop of battlements, may be seen in alto-relievo and bold relief the\r\ngreat dipper, or Ursa Major, with the pointers ranging nearly toward\r\nthe north star. (Moral: the lost may find themselves by the priesthood.)\r\n\r\nI will now glance at the main body of the house. I have before stated\r\nthat the basement was divided into many rooms. The central one is\r\narranged for a baptismal font, and is 59 feet long by 35 feet wide,\r\nseparated from the main wall by four rooms, two on each side, 19 feet\r\nlong by 12 feet wide. On the east and west sides of these rooms are\r\nfour passages 12 feet wide; these lead to and from by outside doors,\r\ntwo on the north and two on the south. Farther east and west from these\r\npassages are four more rooms, two at each end, 28 feet wide by 38¹⁄₂\r\nlong. These two thin walls occupy the basement. All the walls start off\r\ntheir footings, and rise 16¹⁄₂ feet, and there stop with groin ceiling.\r\n\r\nWe are now up to the line of the base string course, 8 feet above the\r\npromenade or steps rising to the temple, which terminates at the cope\r\nof the pedestal, and to the first floor of said house. This room is\r\njoined to the outer courts, these courts being the width between towers\r\n16 feet by 9 in the clear. We ascend to the floors of these courts\r\n(they being on a line with the first floor of the main house) by four\r\nflights of stone steps 9¹⁄₂ feet wide, arranged in the basement work,\r\nthe first step ranging to the outer line of towers. From these courts\r\ndoors admit to any part of the building.\r\n\r\nThe size of the first large room is 120 feet long by 80 feet wide;\r\nthe height reaches nearly to the second string course. The room is\r\narched over in the centre with an elliptical arch, which drops at its\r\nflank 10 feet, and has 38 feet span. The side ceilings have one fourth\r\nelliptical arches, which start from the side walls of the main building\r\n16 feet high, and terminate at the capitals of the columns, or foot\r\nof centre arch, at the height of 24 feet. The columns obtain their\r\nbearings direct from the footings of the said house; these columns\r\nextend up to support the floor above. The outside walls of this story\r\nare 7 feet thick. The space, from the termination of the foot of the\r\ncentre arch to the outer wall, is divided into sixteen compartments,\r\neight in each side, making rooms 14 feet by 14, clear of partitions,\r\nand 10 feet high, leaving a passage of 6 feet wide next to each flank\r\nof the centre arch, which is approached from the ends. These rooms\r\nare each lighted by an elliptical or oval window, whose major axis is\r\nvertical.\r\n\r\nThe second large room is one foot wider than the room below; this is in\r\nconsequence of the wall being but 6 feet thick, falling off 6 inches on\r\nthe inner and 6 on the outer side. The second string course provides\r\nfor this on the outer side. The rooms of this story are similar to\r\nthose below. The side walls have nine buttresses on a side, and have\r\neight tiers of windows, five in each tier.\r\n\r\nThe foot of the basement windows are 8 inches above the promenade,\r\nrise 3 feet perpendicular, and terminate in a semicircular head.\r\nThe first-story windows have 12 feet long of sash to the top of the\r\nsemicircular head. The oval windows have 6¹⁄₂ feet length of sash. The\r\nwindows of the second story are the same as those below. All these\r\nframes have 4¹⁄₂ feet width of sash. The pedestals under all the\r\nbuttresses project at their base 2 feet; above their base, which is 15\r\ninches by 4¹⁄₂ feet wide, on each front is a figure of a globe 3 feet\r\n11 inches across, whose axis corresponds with the axis of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe base string course forms a cope for those pedestals. Above this\r\ncope the buttresses are 3¹⁄₂ feet, and continue to the height of 100\r\nfeet. Above the promenade, close under the second string course on each\r\nof the buttresses, is the moon, represented in its different phases.\r\nClose under the third string course or cornice is the face of the sun.\r\nImmediately above is Saturn with his rings. The buttresses terminate\r\nwith a projected cope.\r\n\r\nThe only difference between the tower buttresses and the one just\r\ndescribed is, instead of Saturn being on them, we have clouds and rays\r\nof light descending.\r\n\r\nAll of these symbols are to be chiseled in bas-relief on solid stone.\r\nThe side walls continue above the string course or cornice 8¹⁄₂\r\nfeet, making the walls 96 feet high, and are formed in battlements\r\ninterspersed with stars.\r\n\r\nThis roof is quite flat, rising only 8 feet, and is to be covered with\r\ngalvanized iron or some other metal. The building is to be otherwise\r\nornamented in many places. The whole structure is designed to symbolize\r\nsome of the great architectural work above. The basement windows recede\r\nin from the face of the outer wall to the sash frame 23 inches, and are\r\nrelieved by a large cavetto, while on the inside they are approached by\r\nstone steps.\r\n\r\nThose windows above the base recede from the face of the wall to\r\nthe sash frame 3 feet, and are surrounded by stone jambs formed in\r\nmouldings, and surmounted by labels over each, which terminate at their\r\nhorizon, excepting the oval windows, whose labels terminate as columns,\r\nwhich extend from an enriched string course at the foot of each window\r\nto the centre of the major axis. My chief object in the last paragraph\r\nis to show to the judgment of any who may be baffled how those windows\r\ncan be come at, etc., etc. All the windows in the towers are moulded,\r\nand have stone jambs, each being crowned with label mouldings. The\r\nwhole house covers an area of 21,850 feet.\r\n\r\nFor farther particulars, wait till the house is done, then come and see\r\nit.\r\n\r\n  (Signed), TRUMAN O. ANGELL, _Architect_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE MARTYRDOM OF JOSEPH SMITH.\r\n\r\nBY APOSTLE JOHN TAYLOR.\r\n\r\nBeing requested by George A. Smith and Willford Woodruff, Church\r\nhistorians, to write an account of events that transpired before and\r\ntook place at the time of the martyrdom of Joseph Smith, in Carthage\r\njail, in Hancock County, State of Illinois, I write the following\r\nprincipally from memory, not having access to any public documents\r\nrelative thereto farther than a few desultory items contained in Ford’s\r\n“History of Illinois.” I must also acknowledge myself considerably\r\nindebted to George A. Smith, who was with me when I wrote it, and\r\nwho, although not there at the time of the bloody transaction, yet\r\nfrom conversing with several persons who were in the capacity of\r\nChurch historians, and aided by an excellent memory, has rendered me a\r\nconsiderable service. These and the few items contained in the notes\r\nat the end of this account is all the aid I have had. I would farther\r\nadd that the items contained in the letter, in relation to dates\r\nespecially, may be considered strictly correct.\r\n\r\nAfter having written the whole, I read it over to the Hon. J. M.\r\nBernhisel, who, with one or two slight alterations, pronounced it\r\nstrictly correct. Brother Bernhisel was present most of the time. I\r\nam afraid that, from the length of time that has transpired since the\r\noccurrence, and having to rely almost exclusively on my memory, there\r\nmay be some slight inaccuracies, but I believe that in the general\r\nit is strictly correct; as I figured in those transactions from the\r\ncommencement to the end, they left no slight impression on my mind.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1844, a very great excitement prevailed in some parts\r\nof the counties of Hancock, Brown, and other neighboring counties,\r\nin relation to the “Mormons,” and a spirit of vindictive hatred and\r\npersecution was exhibited among the people, which was manifested in the\r\nmost bitter and acrimonious language, as well as by acts of hostility\r\nand violence, frequently threatening the destruction of the citizens\r\nof Nauvoo and vicinity, and utter annihilation of the “Mormons” and\r\n“Mormonism,” and in some instances breaking out in the most violent\r\nacts of ruffianly barbarity; persons were kidnapped, whipped,\r\nprosecuted, and falsely accused of various crimes; their cattle and\r\nhouses injured, destroyed, or stolen; vexatious prosecutions were\r\ninstituted to vex, harass, and annoy. In some remote neighborhoods they\r\nwere expelled from their homes without redress, and in others violence\r\nwas threatened to their persons and property, while in others every\r\nkind of insult and indignity was heaped upon them, to induce them to\r\nabandon their homes, the county, or the state.\r\n\r\nThese annoyances, prosecutions, and persecutions were instigated\r\nthrough different agencies and by various classes of men, actuated by\r\ndifferent motives, but all uniting in the one object, prosecution,\r\npersecution, and extermination of the Saints.\r\n\r\nThere were a number of wicked and corrupt men living in Nauvoo and\r\nits vicinity who had belonged to the Church, but whose conduct was\r\nincompatible with the Gospel; they were accordingly dealt with by the\r\nChurch and severed from its communion; some of these had been prominent\r\nmembers, and held official stations either in the city or Church. Among\r\nthese was John C. Bennett, formerly Mayor; William Law, Councilor to\r\nJoseph Smith; Wilson Law, his natural brother, and general in the\r\nNauvoo Legion; Dr. R. D. Foster, a man of some property, but with a\r\nvery bad reputation; Francis and Chauncey Higbee, the latter a young\r\nlawyer, and both sons of a respectable and honored man in the Church,\r\nknown as Judge Elias Higbee, who died about twelve months before.\r\n\r\nBesides these, there were a great many apostates, both in the city and\r\ncountry, of less notoriety, who, for their delinquencies, had been\r\nexpelled from the Church. John C. Bennett and Francis and Chauncey\r\nHigbee were cut off from the Church; the former was also cashiered from\r\nhis generalship for the most flagrant acts of seduction and adultery;\r\nand such was the scandalous nature of the developments in their cases,\r\nthat the high council before whom they were tried had to sit with\r\nclosed doors.\r\n\r\nWilliam Law, although councilor to Joseph, was found to be his most\r\nbitter foe and maligner, and to hold intercourse, contrary to all\r\nlaw, in his own house, with a young lady resident with him, and it\r\nwas afterward proved that he had conspired with some Missourians to\r\ntake Joseph Smith’s life, and was only saved by Josiah Arnold, who,\r\nbeing on guard at his house, prevented the assassins from seeing him.\r\nYet, although having murder in his heart, his manners were generally\r\ncourteous and mild, and he was well calculated to deceive.\r\n\r\nGeneral Wilson Law was cut off from the Church for seduction,\r\nfalsehood, and defamation; both the above were also court-martialed by\r\nthe Nauvoo Legion and expelled. Foster was also cut off, I believe, for\r\ndishonesty, fraud, and falsehood. I know he was eminently guilty of\r\nthe whole, but whether these were the specific charges or not, I don’t\r\nknow, but I do know that he was a notoriously wicked and corrupt man.\r\n\r\nBesides the above characters and “Mormonic” apostates, there were\r\nother three parties. The first of these may be called religionists,\r\nthe second politicians, and the third counterfeiters, blacklegs,\r\nhorse-thieves, and cut-throats.\r\n\r\nThe religious party were chagrined and maddened because “Mormonism”\r\ncame in contact with their religion, and they could not oppose it\r\nfrom the Scriptures; and thus, like the ancient Jews, when enraged\r\nat the exhibition of their follies and hypocrisies by Jesus and his\r\napostles, so these were infuriated against the Mormons because of their\r\ndiscomfiture by them; and instead of owning the truth and rejoicing\r\nin it, they were ready to gnash upon them with their teeth, and to\r\npersecute the believers in principles which they could not disprove.\r\n\r\nThe political party were those who were of opposite politics to us.\r\nThere were always two parties, the Whigs and Democrats, and we could\r\nnot vote for one without offending the other; and it not unfrequently\r\nhappened that candidates for office would place the issue of their\r\nelection upon opposition to the “Mormons,” in order to gain political\r\ninfluence from religious prejudice, in which case the “Mormons” were\r\ncompelled, in self-defense, to vote against them, which resulted almost\r\ninvariably against our opponents. This made them angry; and, although\r\nit was of their own making, and the “Mormons” could not be expected\r\nto do otherwise, yet they raged on account of their discomfiture, and\r\nsought to wreak their fury on the “Mormons.” As an instance of the\r\nabove, when Joseph Duncan was candidate for the office of Governor of\r\nIllinois, he pledged himself to his party that, if he could be elected,\r\nhe would exterminate or drive the “Mormons” from the state.[234] The\r\nconsequence was that Governor Ford was elected. The Whigs, seeing that\r\nthey had been outgeneraled by the Democrats in securing the “Mormon”\r\nvote, became seriously alarmed, and sought to repair their disaster\r\nby raising a kind of crusade against that people. The Whig newspapers\r\nteemed with accounts of the wonders and enormities of Nauvoo, and of\r\nthe awful wickedness of a party which could consent to receive the\r\nsupport of such miscreants. Governor Duncan, who was really a brave,\r\nhonest man, and who had nothing to do with getting the “Mormon”\r\ncharters passed through the Legislature, took the stump on this subject\r\nin good earnest, and expected to be elected governor almost on this\r\nquestion alone. The third party, composed of counterfeiters, blacklegs,\r\nhorse-thieves, and cut-throats, were a pack of scoundrels that infested\r\nthe whole of the Western country at that time. In some districts\r\ntheir influence was so great as to control important state and county\r\noffices. On this subject Governor Ford says the following:\r\n\r\n  [234] See his remarks as contained in his History of Illinois, p. 269.\r\n\r\n“Then, again, the northern part of the state was not destitute\r\nof its organized bands of rogues, engaged in murders, robberies,\r\nhorse-stealing, and in making and passing counterfeit money. These\r\nrogues were scattered all over the north, but the most of them were\r\nlocated in the counties of Ogle, Winnebago, Lee, and De Kalb.\r\n\r\n“In the county of Ogle they were so numerous, strong, and well\r\norganized that they could not be convicted for their crimes. By getting\r\nsome of their numbers on the juries, by producing a host of witnesses\r\nto sustain their defense by perjured evidence, and by changing the\r\nvenue of one county to another, by continuances from term to term, and\r\nby the inability of witnesses to attend from time to time at distant\r\nand foreign counties, they most generally managed to be acquitted.”[235]\r\n\r\n  [235] Ford’s History of Illinois, p. 246.\r\n\r\nThere was a combination of horse-thieves extending from Galena to\r\nAlton. There were counterfeiters engaged in merchandising, trading,\r\nand store-keeping in most of the cities and villages, and in some\r\ndistricts, I have been credibly informed by men to whom they have\r\ndisclosed their secrets, the judges, sheriffs, constables, and jailers,\r\nas well as professional men, were more or less associated with them.\r\nThese had in their employ the most reckless, abandoned wretches, who\r\nstood ready to carry into effect the most desperate enterprises,\r\nand were careless alike of human life and property. Their object in\r\npersecuting the “Mormons” was in part to cover their own rascality, and\r\nin part to prevent them from exposing and prosecuting them; but the\r\nprincipal reason was plunder, believing that if they could be removed\r\nor driven they would be made fat on Mormon spoils, besides having in\r\nthe deserted city a good asylum for the prosecution of their diabolical\r\npursuits.\r\n\r\nThis conglomeration of apostate Mormons, religious bigots, political\r\nfanatics, and combination of blacklegs, all united their forces against\r\nthe “Mormons,” and organized themselves into a party, denominated\r\n“anti-Mormons.” Some of them, we have reason to believe, joined the\r\nChurch in order to cover their nefarious practices, and when they were\r\nexpelled for their unrighteousness only raged with greater violence.\r\nThey circulated every kind of falsehood that they could collect or\r\nmanufacture against the Mormons. They also had a paper to assist them\r\nin their propagations called the “Warsaw Signal,” edited by a Mr.\r\nThomas Sharp, a violent and unprincipled man, who shrunk not from\r\nany enormity. The anti-Mormons had public meetings, which were very\r\nnumerously attended, where they passed resolutions of the most violent\r\nand inflammatory kind, threatening to drive, expel, and exterminate the\r\n“Mormons” from the state, at the same time accusing them of all the\r\nvocabulary of crime.\r\n\r\nThey appointed their meetings in various parts of Hancock, M‘Donough,\r\nand other counties, which soon resulted in the organization of\r\narmed mobs, under the direction of officers who reported to their\r\nhead-quarters, and the reports of which were published in the\r\nanti-Mormon paper, and circulated through the adjoining counties. We\r\nalso published in the “Times and Seasons” and the “Nauvoo Neighbor”\r\n(two papers published and edited by me at that time) an account, not\r\nonly of their proceedings, but our own. But such was the hostile\r\nfeeling, so well arranged their plans, and so desperate and lawless\r\ntheir measures, that it was with the greatest difficulty that we could\r\nget our papers circulated; they were destroyed by postmasters and\r\nothers, and scarcely ever arrived at the place of their destination,\r\nso that a great many of the people, who would have been otherwise\r\npeaceable, were excited by their misrepresentations, and instigated to\r\njoin their hostile or predatory bands.\r\n\r\nEmboldened by the acts of those outside, the apostate “Mormons,”\r\nassociated with others, commenced the publication of a libelous paper\r\nin Nauvoo, called the “Nauvoo Expositor.” This paper not only reprinted\r\nfrom the others, but put in circulation the most libelous, false, and\r\ninfamous reports concerning the citizens of Nauvoo, and especially\r\nthe ladies. It was, however, no sooner put in circulation than the\r\nindignation of the whole community was aroused; so much so, that they\r\nthreatened its annihilation; and I do not believe that in any other\r\ncity in the United States, if the same charge had been made against the\r\ncitizens, it would have been permitted to remain one day. As it was\r\namong us, under these circumstances, it was thought best to convene the\r\nCity Council to take into consideration the adoption of some measures\r\nfor its removal, as it was deemed better that this should be done\r\nlegally than illegally. Joseph Smith, therefore, who was then mayor,\r\nconvened the City Council for that purpose; the paper was introduced\r\nand read, and the subject examined. All, or nearly all present,\r\nexpressed their indignation at the course taken by the “Expositor,”\r\nwhich was owned by some of the aforesaid apostates, associated with one\r\nor two others: Wilson Law, Dr. Foster, Charles Ivins, and the Higbees\r\nbefore referred to, some lawyers, store-keepers, and others in Nauvoo\r\nwho were not “Mormons,” together with the “anti-Mormons” outside of\r\nthe city, sustained it. The calculation was, by false statements, to\r\nunsettle the minds of many in the city, and to form combinations there\r\nsimilar to the anti-Mormon associations outside of the city. Various\r\nattempts had therefore been made by the party to annoy and irritate\r\nthe citizens of Nauvoo; false accusations had been made, vexatious\r\nlawsuits instituted, threats made, and various devices resorted to\r\nto influence the public mind, and, if possible, to induce us to the\r\ncommission of some overt act that might make us amenable to the law.\r\nWith a perfect knowledge, therefore, of the designs of these infernal\r\nscoundrels who were in our midst, as well as of those who surrounded\r\nus, the City Council entered upon an investigation of the matter.\r\nThey felt that they were in a critical position, and that any move\r\nmade for the abating of that press would be looked upon, or at least\r\nrepresented, as a direct attack upon the liberty of speech, and that,\r\nso far from displeasing our enemies, it would be looked upon by them as\r\none of the best circumstances that could transpire to assist them in\r\ntheir nefarious and bloody designs. Being a member of the City Council,\r\nI well remember the feeling of responsibility that seemed to rest upon\r\nall present; nor shall I soon forget the bold, manly, independent\r\nexpressions of Joseph Smith on that occasion in relation to this\r\nmatter. He exhibited in glowing colors the meanness, corruption, and\r\nultimate designs of the “anti-Mormons;” their despicable characters and\r\nungodly influences, especially of those who were in our midst; he told\r\nof the responsibility that rested upon us, as guardians of the public\r\ninterest, to stand up in the defense of the injured and oppressed, to\r\nstem the current of corruption, and, as men and saints, to put a stop\r\nto this flagrant outrage upon this people’s rights. He stated that no\r\nman was a stronger advocate for the liberty of speech and of the press\r\nthan himself; yet, when this noble gift is utterly prostituted and\r\nabused, as in the present instance, it loses all claim to our respect,\r\nand becomes as great an agent for evil as it can possibly be for good;\r\nand notwithstanding the apparent advantage we should give our enemies\r\nby this act, yet it behooved us, as men, to act independent of all\r\nsecondary influences, to perform the part of men of enlarged minds,\r\nand boldly and fearlessly to discharge the duties devolving upon us\r\nby declaring as a nuisance, and removing this filthy, libelous, and\r\nseditious sheet from our midst.\r\n\r\nThe subject was discussed in various forms, and after the remarks made\r\nby the mayor, every one seemed to be waiting for some one else to\r\nspeak. After a considerable pause, I arose and expressed my feelings\r\nfrankly, as Joseph had done, and numbers of others followed in the same\r\nstrain; and I think, but am not certain, that I made a motion for the\r\nremoval of that press as a nuisance. This motion was finally put, and\r\ncarried by all but one; and he conceded that the measure was just, but\r\nabstained through fear.\r\n\r\nSeveral members of the City Council were not in the Church. The\r\nfollowing is the bill referred to:\r\n\r\n  _Bill for Removing of the Press of the “Nauvoo Expositor.”_[236]\r\n\r\n  “Resolved by the City Council of the City of Nauvoo, that the\r\n  printing-office from whence issues the ‘Nauvoo Expositor’ is a public\r\n  nuisance; and also all of said ‘Nauvoo Expositors’ which may be or\r\n  exist in said establishment; and the mayor is instructed to cause\r\n  said establishment and papers to be removed without delay, in such\r\n  manner as he shall direct.\r\n\r\n  “Passed June 10th, 1844.\r\n\r\n  GEO. W. HARRIS, President _pro tem._\r\n  “W. RICHARDS, Recorder.”\r\n\r\n  [236] Des. News, No. 29, Sept. 23, 1857, p. 226.\r\n\r\nAfter the passage of the bill, the marshal, John P. Green, was ordered\r\nto abate or remove, which he forthwith proceeded to do by summoning a\r\nposse of men for that purpose. The press was removed or broken, I don’t\r\nremember which, by the marshal, and the types scattered in the street.\r\n\r\nThis seemed to be one of those extreme cases that require extreme\r\nmeasures, as the press was still proceeding in its inflammatory course.\r\nIt was feared that, as it was almost universally execrated, should it\r\ncontinue longer, an indignant people might commit some overt act which\r\nmight lead to serious consequences, and that it was better to use legal\r\nthan illegal means.\r\n\r\nThis, as was foreseen, was the very course our enemies wished us to\r\npursue, as it afforded them an opportunity of circulating a very\r\nplausible story about the “Mormons” being opposed to the liberty of the\r\npress and of free speech, which they were not slow to avail themselves\r\nof. Stories were fabricated, and facts perverted; false statements\r\nwere made, and this act brought in as an example to sustain the whole\r\nof their fabrications; and, as if inspired by Satan, they labored\r\nwith an energy and zeal worthy of a better cause. They had runners\r\nto circulate their reports, not only through Hancock Co., but in all\r\nthe surrounding counties; these reports were communicated to their\r\n“anti-Mormon” societies, and these societies circulated them in their\r\nseveral districts. The “anti-Mormon” paper, the “Warsaw Signal,” was\r\nfilled with inflammatory articles and misrepresentations in relation\r\nto us, and especially to this act of destroying the press. We were\r\nrepresented as a horde of lawless ruffians and brigands, anti-American\r\nand anti-republican, steeped in crime and iniquity, opposed to freedom\r\nof speech and of the press, and all the rights and immunities of a free\r\nand enlightened people; that neither persons nor property were secure;\r\nthat we had designs upon the citizens of Illinois and of the United\r\nStates, and the people were called upon to rise _en masse_, and put us\r\ndown, drive us away, or exterminate us as a pest to society, and alike\r\ndangerous to our neighbors, the state, and commonwealth.\r\n\r\nThese statements were extensively copied and circulated throughout the\r\nUnited States. A true statement of the facts in question was published\r\nby us both in the “Times and Seasons” and the “Nauvoo Neighbor,” but it\r\nwas found impossible to circulate them in the immediate counties, as\r\nthey were destroyed at the post-offices or otherwise by the agents of\r\nthe anti-Mormons, and, in order to get the mail to go abroad, I had to\r\nsend the papers a distance of thirty or forty miles from Nauvoo, and\r\nsometimes to St. Louis (upward of two hundred miles), to insure its\r\nproceeding on its route, and then one half or two thirds of the papers\r\nnever reached the place of destination, being intercepted or destroyed\r\nby our enemies.\r\n\r\nThese false reports stirred up the community around, of whom many, on\r\naccount of religious prejudice, were easily instigated to join the\r\n“anti-Mormons,” and embark in any crusade that might be undertaken\r\nagainst the “Mormons;” hence their ranks swelled in numbers, and new\r\norganizations were formed, meetings were held, resolutions passed, and\r\nmen and means volunteered for the extirpation of the “Mormons.”\r\n\r\nThese also were the active men in blowing up the fury of the people,\r\nin hopes that a popular movement might be set on foot, which would\r\nresult in the expulsion or extermination of the “Mormon” voters. For\r\nthis purpose public meetings had been called, inflammatory speeches\r\nhad been made, exaggerated reports had been extensively circulated,\r\ncommittees had been appointed, who rode night and day to spread the\r\nreports and solicit the aid of neighboring counties, and at a public\r\nmeeting at Warsaw resolutions were passed to expel or exterminate\r\nthe “Mormon” population. This was not, however, a movement which was\r\nunanimously concurred in. The county contained a goodly number of\r\ninhabitants in favor of peace, or who at least desired to be neutral in\r\nsuch a contest. These were stigmatized by the name of “Jack Mormons,”\r\nand there were not a few of the more furious exciters of the people\r\nwho openly expressed their intention to involve them in the common\r\nexpulsion or extermination.\r\n\r\nA system of excitement and agitation was artfully planned and executed\r\nwith tact. It consisted in spreading reports and rumors of the most\r\nfearful character. As examples: On the morning before my arrival at\r\nCarthage I was awakened at an early hour by the frightful report, which\r\nwas asserted with confidence and apparent consternation, that the\r\n“Mormons” had already commenced the work of burning, destruction, and\r\nmurder, and that every man capable of bearing arms was instantly wanted\r\nat Carthage for the protection of the county.\r\n\r\nWe lost no time in starting; but when we arrived at Carthage we could\r\nhear no more concerning this story. Again, during the few days that\r\nthe militia were encamped at Carthage, frequent applications were made\r\nto me to send a force here, and a force there, and a force all about\r\nthe country, to prevent murders, robberies, and larcenies which, it\r\nwas said, were threatened by the “Mormons.” No such forces were sent,\r\nnor were any such offenses committed at that time, except the stealing\r\nof some provisions, and there was never the least proof that this was\r\ndone by a “Mormon.” Again, on my late visit to Hancock County, I was\r\ninformed by some of their violent enemies that the larcenies of the\r\n“Mormons” had become unusually numerous and insufferable. They admitted\r\nthat but little had been done in this way in their immediate vicinity,\r\nbut they insisted that sixteen horses had been stolen by the “Mormons”\r\nin one night near Lima, and, upon inquiry, was told that no horses\r\nhad been stolen in that neighborhood, but that sixteen horses had\r\nbeen stolen in one night in Hancock County. This last informant being\r\ntold of the Hancock story, again changed the venue to another distant\r\nsettlement in the northern edge of Adams.[237]\r\n\r\n  [237] Ford’s History of Illinois, p. 330, 331.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time legal proceedings were instituted against the members\r\nof the City Council of Nauvoo. A writ, here subjoined, was issued upon\r\nthe affidavit of the Laws, Foster, Higbees, and Ivins, by Mr. Morrison,\r\na justice of the peace in Carthage, the county seat of Hancock, and put\r\ninto the hands of one David Bettesworth, a constable of the same place.\r\n\r\n  _Writ issued upon affidavit by Thomas Morrison, J. P., State of\r\n  Illinois, Hancock County, ss._\r\n\r\n  “The people of the State of Illinois, to all constables, sheriffs,\r\n  and coroners of said state, greeting:\r\n\r\n  “Whereas complaint hath been made before me, one of the justices\r\n  of the peace in and for the County of Hancock aforesaid, upon the\r\n  oath of Francis M.

Huntington, Jonathan Dunham, Stephen\r\n  Markham, William Edwards, Jonathan Holmes, Jesse P. Harmon, John\r\n  Lytle, Joseph W. Coolidge, Harvey D. Redfield, Porter Rockwell, and\r\n  Levi Richards, of said county, did, on the 10th day of June instant,\r\n  commit a riot at and within the county aforesaid, wherein they with\r\n  force and violence broke into the printing-office of the ‘Nauvoo\r\n  Expositor,’ and unlawfully and with force burned and destroyed the\r\n  printing-press, type, and fixtures of the same, being the property of\r\n  William Law, Wilson Law, Charles Ivins, Francis M.

Redfield, Porter\r\n  Rockwell, and Levi Richards, and bring them before me, or some other\r\n  justice of the peace, to answer the premises, and farther to be dealt\r\n  with according to law.\r\n\r\n  “Given under my hand and seal at Carthage, in the county aforesaid,\r\n  this 11th day of June, A.D. 1844.\r\n\r\n  THOMAS MORRISON, J. P.” (Seal.)[238]\r\n\r\n  [238] Des. News, No. 30, Sept. 30, 1857, p. 233.\r\n\r\nThe council refused not to attend to the legal proceedings in the\r\ncase, but, as the law of Illinois made it the privilege of the persons\r\naccused to go “or appear before the issuer of the writ, or any\r\nother justice of peace,” they requested to be taken before another\r\nmagistrate, either in the city of Nauvoo or at any reasonable distance\r\nout of it.\r\n\r\nThis the constable, who was a mobocrat, refused to do; and as this\r\nwas our legal privilege, we refused to be dragged, contrary to law,\r\na distance of eighteen miles, when at the same time we had reason to\r\nbelieve that an organized band of mobocrats were assembled for the\r\npurpose of extermination or murder, and among whom it would not be safe\r\nto go without a superior force of armed men. A writ of habeas corpus\r\nwas called for, and issued by the municipal court of Nauvoo, taking us\r\nout of the hands of Bettesworth, and placing us in the charge of the\r\ncity marshal. We went before the municipal court, and were dismissed.\r\nOur refusal to obey this illegal proceeding was by them construed into\r\na refusal to submit to law, and circulated as such, and the people\r\neither did believe, or professed to believe, that we were in open\r\nrebellion against the laws and the authorities of the state. Hence mobs\r\nbegan to assemble, among which all through the country inflammatory\r\nspeeches were made, exciting them to mobocracy and violence. Soon they\r\ncommenced their prosecutions of our outside settlements, kidnapping\r\nsome, and whipping and otherwise abusing others.\r\n\r\nThe persons thus abused fled to Nauvoo as soon as practicable, and\r\nrelated their injuries to Joseph Smith, then mayor of the city,\r\nand lieutenant general of the Nauvoo Legion; they also went before\r\nmagistrates, and made affidavits of what they had suffered, seen,\r\nand heard. These affidavits, in connection with a copy of all our\r\nproceedings, were forwarded by Joseph Smith to Mr. Ford, then Governor\r\nof Illinois, with an expression of our desire to abide law, and a\r\nrequest that the governor would instruct him how to proceed in the case\r\nof the arrival of an armed mob against the city. The governor sent back\r\ninstructions to Joseph Smith that, as he was lieutenant general of the\r\nNauvoo Legion, it was his duty to protect the city and surrounding\r\ncountry, and issued orders to that effect. Upon the reception of these\r\norders Joseph Smith assembled the people of the city, and laid before\r\nthem the governor’s instructions; he also convened the officers of the\r\nNauvoo Legion for the purpose of conferring in relation to the best\r\nmode of defense. He also issued orders to the men to hold themselves in\r\nreadiness in case of being called upon. On the following day General\r\nJoseph Smith, with his staff, the leading officers of the Legion, and\r\nsome prominent strangers who were in our midst, made a survey of the\r\noutside boundaries of the city, which was very extensive, being about\r\nfive miles up and down the river, and about two and a half back in the\r\ncentre, for the purpose of ascertaining the position of the ground, and\r\nthe feasibility of defense, and to make all necessary arrangements in\r\ncase of an attack.\r\n\r\nIt may be well here to remark that numbers of gentlemen, who were to\r\nus strangers, either came on purpose or were passing through Nauvoo,\r\nwho, upon learning the position of things, expressed their indignation\r\nagainst our enemies, and avowed their readiness to assist us by\r\ntheir council or otherwise; it was some of these who assisted us in\r\nreconnoitering the city, and finding out its adaptability for defense,\r\nand the best mode of protection against an armed force. The Legion was\r\ncalled together and drilled, and every means made use of for defense;\r\nat the call of the officers both old and young men came forward, both\r\ndenizens from the city and from the outside regions, and I believe at\r\none time they mustered to the number of about five thousand.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time our enemies were not idle in mustering their forces\r\nand committing depredations, nor had they been; it was, in fact, their\r\ngathering that called ours into existence; their forces continued to\r\naccumulate; they assumed a threatening attitude, and assembled in large\r\nbodies, armed and equipped for war, and threatened the destruction\r\nand extermination of the “Mormons.” An account of their outrages and\r\nassemblages was forwarded to Governor Ford almost daily, accompanied\r\nby affidavits furnished by eyewitnesses of their proceedings. Persons\r\nwere also sent out to the counties around with pacific intentions, to\r\ngive them an account of the true state of affairs, and to notify them\r\nof the feelings and dispositions of the people of Nauvoo, and thus, if\r\npossible, quell the excitement. In some of the more distant counties\r\nthese men were very successful, and produced a salutary influence upon\r\nthe minds of many intelligent and well-disposed men. In neighboring\r\ncounties, however, where “anti-Mormon” influence prevailed, they\r\nproduced little effect. At the same time, guards were stationed around\r\nNauvoo, and picket-guards in the distance. At length opposing forces\r\ngathered so near that more active measures were taken; reconnoitering\r\nparties were sent out, and the city proclaimed under martial law.\r\nThings now assumed a belligerent attitude, and persons passing through\r\nthe city were questioned as to what they knew of the enemy, while\r\npasses were in some instances given to avoid difficulty with the\r\nguards. Joseph Smith continued to send on messengers to the governor\r\n(Philip B. Lewis and other messengers were sent). Samuel James, then\r\nresiding at La Harpe, carried a message and dispatches to him, and in\r\na day or two after Bishop Edward Hunter and others went again with\r\nfresh dispatches, representations, affidavits, and instructions;\r\nbut as the weather was excessively wet, the rivers swollen, and the\r\nbridges washed away in many places, it was with great difficulty\r\nthat they proceeded on their journeys. As the mobocracy had at last\r\nattracted the governor’s attention, he started in company with some\r\nothers from Springfield to the scene of trouble, and missed, I believe,\r\nboth Brothers James and Hunter on the road, and of course did not see\r\ntheir documents. He came to Carthage, and made that place, which was a\r\nregular mobocratic den, his head-quarters; as it was the county-seat,\r\nhowever, of Hancock County, that circumstance might, in a measure,\r\njustify his staying there.\r\n\r\nTo avoid the appearance of all hostility on our part, and to fulfill\r\nthe law in every particular, at the suggestion of Judge Thomas, judge\r\nof that judicial district, who had come to Nauvoo at the time, and who\r\nstated that we had fulfilled the law, but, in order to satisfy all, he\r\nwould counsel us to go before Esquire Wells,[239] who was not in our\r\nChurch, and have a hearing. We did so, and after a full hearing we were\r\nagain dismissed.\r\n\r\n  [239] Now a member of the First Presidency.--Ed.\r\n\r\nThe governor on the road collected forces, some of whom were\r\nrespectable; but on his arrival in the neighborhood of the difficulties\r\nhe received as militia all the companies of the mob forces who united\r\nwith him. After his arrival at Carthage he sent two gentlemen from\r\nthere to Nauvoo as a committee to wait upon General Joseph Smith,\r\ninforming him of the arrival of his excellency, with a request that\r\nGeneral Smith would send out a committee to wait upon the governor and\r\nrepresent to him the state of affairs in relation to the difficulties\r\nthat then existed in the county. We met this committee while we were\r\nreconnoitering the city, to find out the best mode of defense as\r\naforesaid. Dr. J. M. Bernhisel and myself were appointed as a committee\r\nby General Smith to wait upon the governor. Previous to going, however,\r\nwe were furnished with affidavits and documents in relation both to our\r\nproceedings and those of the mob; in addition to the general history of\r\nthe transaction, we took with us a duplicate of those documents which\r\nhad been forwarded by Bishop Hunter, Brother James, and others. We\r\nstarted from Carthage in company with the aforesaid gentleman at about\r\n7 o’clock on the evening of the 21st of June, and arrived at Carthage\r\nat about 11 P.M. We put up at the same hotel with the governor, kept by\r\na Mr. Hamilton; on our arrival we found the governor in bed, but not so\r\nwith the other inhabitants. The town was filled with a perfect set of\r\nrabble and rowdies, who, under the influence of Bacchus, seemed to be\r\nholding a grand saturnalia, whooping, yelling, and vociferating as if\r\nBedlam had broken loose.\r\n\r\nOn our arrival at the hotel, and while supper was preparing, a man came\r\nto me, dressed as a soldier, and told me that a man named David Carn\r\nhad just been taken prisoner, and was about to be committed to jail,\r\nand wanted me to go bail for him. Believing this to be a ruse to get me\r\nout alone, and that some violence was intended, after consulting with\r\nDr. Bernhisel, I told the men that I was well acquainted with Mr. Carn,\r\nthat I knew him to be a gentleman, and did not believe that he had\r\ntransgressed law, and, moreover, that I considered it a very singular\r\ntime to be holding courts and calling for security, particularly as the\r\ntown was full of rowdyism.\r\n\r\nI informed him that both Dr. Bernhisel and myself would, if necessary,\r\ngo bail for him in the morning, but that we did not feel ourselves safe\r\namong such a set at that late hour of the night.\r\n\r\nAfter supper, on retiring to our room, we had to pass through another,\r\nwhich was separated from ours only by a board partition, the beds in\r\neach room being placed side by side, with the exception of this fragile\r\npartition. On the bed that was in the room which we passed through I\r\ndiscovered a man by the name of Jackson, a desperate character, and\r\na reputed, notorious cut-throat and murderer. I hinted to the doctor\r\nthat things looked rather suspicious, and looked to see that my arms\r\nwere in order. The doctor and I both occupied one bed. We had scarcely\r\nlaid down when a knock at the door, accompanied by a voice, announced\r\nthe approach of Chauncey Higbee, the young lawyer and apostate before\r\nreferred to.\r\n\r\nHe addressed himself to the doctor, and stated that the object of\r\nhis visit was to obtain the release of Daniel Carn; that Carn he\r\nbelieved to be an honest man; that if he had done any thing wrong, it\r\nwas through improper counsel, and that it was a pity that he should\r\nbe incarcerated, particularly when he could be so easily released;\r\nhe urged the doctor, as a friend, not to leave so good a man in such\r\nan unpleasant situation; he finally prevailed upon the doctor to go\r\nand give bail, assuring him that on his giving bail Carn would be\r\nimmediately dismissed.\r\n\r\nDuring this conversation I did not say a word. Higbee left the doctor\r\nto dress, with the intention of returning and taking him to the court.\r\nAs soon as Higbee had left, I told the doctor that he had better not\r\ngo; that I believed this affair was all a ruse to get us separated;\r\nthat they knew we had documents with us from General Smith to show\r\nto the governor; that I believed their object was to get possession\r\nof those papers, and, perhaps, when they had separated us, to murder\r\none or both. The doctor, who was actuated by the best of motives in\r\nyielding to the assumed solicitude of Higbee, coincided with my views;\r\nhe then went to Higbee, and told him that he had concluded not to go\r\nthat night, but that he and I would both wait upon the justice and Mr.\r\nCarn in the morning.\r\n\r\nThat night I lay awake with my pistols under my pillow, waiting for any\r\nemergency. Nothing more occurred during the night. In the morning we\r\narose early, and after breakfast sought an interview with the governor,\r\nand were told that we could have an audience, I think, at 10 o’clock.\r\nIn the mean time we called upon Mr. Smith, a Justice of the Peace, who\r\nhad Mr. Carn in charge. We represented that we had been called upon\r\nthe night before by two different parties to go bail for a Mr. Daniel\r\nCarn, whom we were informed he had in custody, and that, believing Mr.\r\nCarn to be an honest man, we had come now for that purpose, and were\r\nprepared to enter into recognizances for his appearance, whereupon Mr.\r\nSmith, the magistrate, remarked “that, under the present excited state\r\nof affairs, he did not think he would be justified in receiving bail\r\nfrom Nauvoo, as it was a matter of doubt whether property would not be\r\nrendered valueless there in a few days.”\r\n\r\nKnowing the party we had to deal with, we were not much surprised at\r\nthis singular proceeding; we then remarked that both of us possessed\r\nproperty in farms out of Nauvoo in the country, and referred him to\r\nthe county records. He then stated that such was the nature of the\r\ncharge against Mr. Carn that he believed he would not be justified in\r\nreceiving any bail. We were thus confirmed in our opinion that the\r\nnight’s proceedings before, in relation to their desire to have us give\r\nbail, was a mere ruse to separate us. We were not permitted to speak\r\nwith Carn, the real charge against whom was that he was traveling in\r\nCarthage or its neighborhood; what the fictitious one was, if I then\r\nknew, I have since forgotten, as things of this kind were of daily\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\nAfter waiting the governor’s pleasure for some time we had an audience;\r\nbut such an audience! He was surrounded by some of the vilest and\r\nmost unprincipled men in creation; some of them had an appearance of\r\nrespectability, and many of them lacked even that. Wilson, and, I\r\nbelieve, William Law, were there, Foster, Frank and Chauncey Higbee,\r\nMr. Mar, a lawyer from Nauvoo, a mobocratic merchant from Warsaw, the\r\naforesaid Jackson, a number of his associates, among whom was the\r\ngovernor’s secretary, in all some fifteen or twenty persons, most of\r\nwhom were recreant to virtue, honor, integrity, and every thing that\r\nis considered honorable among men. I can well remember the feelings\r\nof disgust that I had in seeing the governor surrounded by such an\r\ninfamous group, and on being introduced to men of so questionable a\r\ncharacter; and had I been on private business, I should have turned to\r\ndepart, and told the governor that if he thought proper to associate\r\nwith such questionable characters, I should beg leave to be excused;\r\nbut coming as we did on public business, we could not, of course,\r\nconsult our private feelings.\r\n\r\nWe then stated to the governor that, in accordance with his request,\r\nGeneral Smith had, in response to his call, sent us to him as a\r\ncommittee of conference; that we were acquainted with most of the\r\ncircumstances that had transpired in and about Nauvoo lately, and were\r\nprepared to give him all information; that, moreover, we had in our\r\npossession testimony and affidavits confirmatory of what we should\r\nsay, which had been forwarded to him by General Joseph Smith; that\r\ncommunications had been forwarded to his excellency by Mr. Hunter,\r\nJames, and others, some of which had not reached their destination,\r\nbut of which we had duplicates with us. We then, in brief, related an\r\noutline of the difficulties, and the course we had pursued from the\r\ncommencement of the troubles up to the present, and handing him the\r\ndocuments, respectfully submitted the whole. During our conversation\r\nand explanations with the governor we were frequently rudely and\r\nimpudently contradicted by the fellows he had around him, and of whom\r\nhe seemed to take no notice.\r\n\r\nHe opened and read a number of the documents himself, and as he\r\nproceeded he was frequently interrupted by “that’s a lie,” “that’s a\r\nGod damned lie,” “that’s an infernal falsehood,” “that’s a blasted\r\nlie,” etc.\r\n\r\nThese men evidently winced at an exposure of their acts, and thus\r\nvulgarly, impudently, and falsely repudiated them. One of their\r\nnumber, Mr. Mar, addressed himself several times to me while in\r\nconversation with the governor. I did not notice him until after a\r\nfrequent repetition of his insolence, when I informed him “that my\r\nbusiness at that time was with Governor Ford,” whereupon I continued my\r\nconversation with his excellency. During the conversation the governor\r\nexpressed a desire that Joseph Smith, and all parties concerned in\r\npassing or executing the city law in relation to the press, had better\r\ncome to Carthage; that, however repugnant it might be to our feelings,\r\nhe thought it would have a tendency to allay public excitement, and\r\nprove to the people what we professed, that we wished to be governed\r\nby law. We represented to him the course he had taken in relation to\r\nthis matter, and our willingness to go before another magistrate other\r\nthan the Municipal Court; the illegal refusal of our request by the\r\nconstable; our dismissal by the Municipal Court, a legally constituted\r\ntribunal; our subsequent trial before Squire Wells at the instance of\r\nJudge Thomas (the circuit judge), and our dismissal by him; that we had\r\nfulfilled the law in every particular; that it was our enemies who were\r\nbreaking the law, and, having murderous designs, were only making use\r\nof this as a pretext to get us into their power. The governor stated\r\nthat the people viewed it differently, and that, notwithstanding our\r\nopinions, he would recommend that the people should be satisfied. We\r\nthen remarked to him that, should Joseph Smith comply with his request,\r\nit would be extremely unsafe, in the present excited state of the\r\ncountry, to come without an armed force; that we had a sufficiency\r\nof men, and were competent to defend ourselves, but that there might\r\nbe danger of collision should our forces and that of our enemies be\r\nbrought into such close proximity. He strenuously advised us not to\r\nbring any arms, and _pledged his faith as governor, and the faith of\r\nthe state, that we should be protected, and that he would guarantee our\r\nperfect safety_.\r\n\r\nWe had at that time about five thousand men under arms, one thousand of\r\nwhich would have been amply sufficient for our protection.\r\n\r\nAt the termination of our interview, and previous to our withdrawal,\r\nafter a long conversation and the perusal of the documents which we\r\nhad brought, the governor informed us that he would prepare a written\r\ncommunication for General Joseph Smith, which he desired us to wait\r\nfor. We were kept waiting for this instrument some five or six hours.\r\n\r\nAbout 5 o’clock in the afternoon we took our departure with not the\r\nmost pleasant feelings. The associations of the governor, the spirit\r\nthat he manifested to compromise with these scoundrels, the length of\r\ntime that he had kept us waiting, and his general deportment, together\r\nwith the infernal spirit that we saw exhibited by those whom he had\r\nadmitted to his councils, made the prospect any thing but promising.\r\n\r\nWe returned on horseback, and arrived at Nauvoo, I think, at about 8\r\nor 9 o’clock at night, accompanied by Captain Yates in command of a\r\ncompany of mounted men, who came for the purpose of escorting Joseph\r\nSmith and the accused in case of their complying with the governor’s\r\nrequest, and going to Carthage. We went directly to Brother Joseph’s,\r\nwhen Captain Yates delivered to him the governor’s communication. A\r\ncouncil was called consisting of Joseph’s brother Hyrum, Dr. Richards,\r\nDr. Bernhisel, myself, and one or two others, when the following letter\r\nwas read from the governor:\r\n\r\n  _Governor Ford’s Letter to the Mayor and Common Council of Nauvoo._\r\n\r\n  “Head Quarters, Carthage, June 21st, 1844.\r\n\r\n  “To the Hon. the Mayor and Common Council of the City of Nauvoo:\r\n\r\n  “GENTLEMEN,--Having heard of the excitement in this part of the\r\n  country, and judging that my presence here might be necessary to\r\n  preserve the peace and enforce the laws, I arrived at this place\r\n  this morning. Both before and since my arrival, complaints of a\r\n  grave character have been made to me of certain proceedings of your\r\n  honorable body. As chief magistrate, it is my duty to see that\r\n  impartial justice shall be done, uninfluenced by the excitement here\r\n  or in your city.\r\n\r\n  “I think, before any decisive measure shall be adopted, that I ought\r\n  to hear the allegations and defenses of all parties. By adopting this\r\n  course I have some hope that the evils of war may be averted; and, at\r\n  any rate, I will be enabled by it to understand the true merits of\r\n  the present difficulties, and shape my course with reference to law\r\n  and justice.\r\n\r\n  “For these reasons, I have to request that you will send out to me,\r\n  at this place, one or more well-informed and discreet persons, who\r\n  will be capable of laying before me your version of the matter, and\r\n  of receiving from me such explanations and resolutions as may be\r\n  determined on.\r\n\r\n  “Colonel Elam S. Freeman will present you this note in the character\r\n  of a herald from the governor. You will respect his character as\r\n  such, and permit him to pass and repass free from molestation.\r\n\r\n  “Your messengers are assured of protection in person and property,\r\n  and will be returned to you in safety.\r\n\r\n  “I am, gentlemen, with high considerations, most respectfully your\r\n  obedient servant,\r\n\r\n  THOMAS FORD, Governor and Commander-in-Chief.”[240]\r\n\r\n  [240] Des. News, No. 33, Oct. 21, 1857, p. 257.\r\n\r\nWe then gave a detail of our interview with the governor. Brother\r\nJoseph was very much dissatisfied with the governor’s letter and with\r\nhis general deportment, and so were the council, and it became a\r\nserious question as to the course we should pursue. Various projects\r\nwere discussed, but nothing definitely decided upon for some time. In\r\nthe interim two gentlemen arrived; one of them, if not both, sons of\r\nJohn C. Calhoun. They had come to Nauvoo, and were very anxious for\r\nan interview with Brother Joseph. These gentlemen detained him for\r\nsome time; and as our council was held in Dr. Bernhisel’s room in the\r\nMansion House, the doctor lay down; and as it was now between 2 and 3\r\no’clock in the morning, and I had had no rest on the previous night, I\r\nwas fatigued, and thinking that Brother Joseph might not return, I left\r\nfor home and rest.\r\n\r\nBeing very much fatigued, I slept soundly, and was somewhat surprised\r\nin the morning by Mrs. Thompson entering my room about 7 o’clock, and\r\nexclaiming in surprise, “What, you here! the brethren have crossed the\r\nriver some time since.” “What brethren?” I asked. “Brother Joseph, and\r\nHyrum, and Brother Richards.” I immediately arose upon learning that\r\nthey had crossed the river, and did not intend to go to Carthage. I\r\ncalled together a number of persons in whom I had confidence, and had\r\nthe type, stereotype plates, and most of the valuable things removed\r\nfrom the printing-office, believing that, should the governor and his\r\nforce come to Nauvoo, the first thing they would do would be to burn\r\nthe printing-office, for I knew that they would be exasperated if\r\nBrother Joseph went away. We had talked over these matters the night\r\nbefore, but nothing was decided upon. It was Brother Joseph’s opinion\r\nthat, should we leave for a time, public excitement, which was then\r\nso intense, would be allayed; that it would throw on the governor\r\nthe responsibility of keeping the peace; that, in the event of any\r\noutrage, the onus would rest upon the governor, who was amply prepared\r\nwith troops, and could command all the forces of the state to preserve\r\norder; and that the acts of his own men would be an overwhelming proof\r\nof their seditious designs, not only to the governor, but to the\r\nworld. He moreover thought that, in the East, where he intended to go,\r\npublic opinion would be set right in relation to these matters, and\r\nits expression would partially influence the West, and that, after the\r\nfirst ebullition, things would assume a shape that would justify his\r\nreturn. I made arrangements for crossing the river, and Brother Elias\r\nSmith and Joseph Cain, who were both employed in the printing-office\r\nwith me, assisted all that lay in their power, together with Brother\r\nBrower and several hands in the printing-office. As we could not find\r\nout the exact whereabouts of Joseph and the brethren, I crossed the\r\nriver in a boat furnished by Brothers Cyrus H. Wheelock and Alfred\r\nBell; and after the removal of the things of the printing-office,\r\nJoseph Cain brought the account-books to me, that we might make\r\narrangements for their adjustment; and Brother Elias Smith, cousin\r\nto Brother Joseph, went to obtain money for the journey, and also to\r\nfind out and report to me the location of the brethren. As Cyrus H.\r\nWheelock was an active, enterprising man, and in the event of not\r\nfinding Brother Joseph I calculated to go to Upper Canada for the time\r\nbeing, and should need a companion, I said to Brother Wheelock, “Can\r\nyou go with me ten or fifteen hundred miles?” He answered “Yes.” “Can\r\nyou start in half an hour?” “Yes.” However, I told him that he had\r\nbetter see his family, who lived over the river, and prepare a couple\r\nof horses and the necessary equipage for the journey, and that, if we\r\ndid not find Brother Joseph before, we would start at nightfall. A\r\nlaughable incident occurred on the eve of my departure. After making\r\nall the preparations I could previous to leaving Nauvoo, and having\r\nbid adieu to my family, I went to a house adjoining the river owned by\r\nBrother Eddy. There I disguised myself so as not to be known, and so\r\neffectually was the transformation that those who had come after me\r\nwith a boat did not know me. I went down to the boat and sat in it.\r\nBrother Bell, thinking it was a stranger, watched my moves for some\r\ntime very impatiently, and then said to Brother Wheelock, “I wish that\r\nold gentleman would go away; he has been pottering around the boat\r\nfor some time, and I am afraid Elder Taylor will be coming.” When he\r\ndiscovered his mistake, he was not a little amused. I was conducted by\r\nBrother Bell to a house that was surrounded by timber on the opposite\r\nside of the river. There I spent several hours in a chamber with\r\nBrother Joseph Cain, adjusting my accounts; and I made arrangements\r\nfor the stereotype plates of the “Book of Mormon,” and “Doctrine and\r\nCovenants,” to be forwarded East, thinking to supply the company with\r\nsubsistence money through the sale of these books in the East.\r\n\r\nMy horses were reported ready by Brother Wheelock, and funds on hand\r\nby Brother Elias Smith. In about half an hour I should have started,\r\nwhen Brother Elias Smith came to me with word that he had found the\r\nbrethren; that they had concluded to go to Carthage, and wished me to\r\nreturn to Nauvoo and accompany them. I must confess that I felt a good\r\ndeal disappointed at this news, but I immediately made preparations\r\nto go. Escorted by Brother Elias Smith, I and my party went to the\r\nneighborhood of Montrose, where we met Brother Joseph, Hyrum, Brother\r\nRichards, and others. Dr. Bernhisel thinks that W. W. Phelps was not\r\nwith Joseph and Hyrum in the morning, but that he met him, myself,\r\nJoseph, and Hyrum, W. Richards, and Brother Calhoun, in the afternoon,\r\nnear Montrose, returning to Nauvoo. On meeting the brethren I learned\r\nthat it was not Brother Joseph’s desire to return, but that he came\r\nback by request of some of the brethren, and that it coincided more\r\nwith Brother Hyrum’s feelings than with those of Brother Joseph. In\r\nfact, after his return, Brother Hyrum expressed himself as perfectly\r\nsatisfied with the course taken, and said that he felt much more at\r\nease in his mind than he did before. On our return the calculation was\r\nto throw ourselves under the immediate protection of the governor, and\r\nto trust to his word and faith for our preservation.\r\n\r\nA message was, I believe, sent to the governor that night, stating that\r\nwe should come to Carthage in the morning, the party that came along\r\nwith us to escort us back, in case we returned to Carthage, having\r\nreturned. It would seem from the following remarks of General Ford that\r\nthere was a design on foot, which was, that if we refused to go to\r\nCarthage at the governor’s request, there should be an increased force\r\ncalled for by the governor, and that we should be destroyed by them. In\r\naccordance with this project, Captain Yates returned with his posse,\r\naccompanied by the constable who held the writ. The following is the\r\ngovernor’s remark in relation to this affair: “The constable and his\r\nescort returned. The constable made no effort to arrest any of them,\r\nnor would he or the guard delay their departure one minute beyond the\r\ntime, to see whether an arrest could be made. Upon their return they\r\nreported that they had been informed that the accused had fled, and\r\ncould not be found. I immediately proposed to a council of officers\r\nto march into Nauvoo with the small force then under my command, but\r\nthe officers were of opinion that it was too small, and many of them\r\ninsisted upon a farther call of the militia. Upon reflection I was of\r\nopinion that the officers were right in the estimate of our force, and\r\nthe project for immediate action was abandoned. I was soon informed,\r\nhowever, of the conduct of constable and guard, and then I was\r\nperfectly satisfied that a most base fraud had been attempted; that,\r\nin fact, it was feared that the ‘Mormons’ would submit, and thereby\r\nentitle themselves to the protection of the law. It was very apparent\r\nthat many of the bustling, active spirits were afraid that there would\r\nbe no occasion for calling out an overwhelming militia force, for\r\nmarching it into Nauvoo, for probable mutiny when there, and for the\r\nextermination of the ‘Mormon’ race. It appeared that the constable\r\nand the escort were fully in the secret, and acted well their part to\r\npromote the conspiracy.”[241]\r\n\r\n  [241] Ford’s History of Illinois, page 333.\r\n\r\nIn the morning Brother Joseph had an interview with the officers of\r\nthe Legion, with the leading members of the City Council, and with\r\nthe principal men of the city. The officers were instructed to dismiss\r\ntheir men, but to have them in a state of readiness to be called upon\r\nin any emergency that might occur.\r\n\r\nAbout half past 6 o’clock the members of the City Council, the\r\nmarshal, Brothers Joseph and Hyrum, and a number of others, started\r\nfor Carthage, all on horseback. We were instructed by Brother Joseph\r\nSmith not to take any arms, and we consequently left them behind.\r\nWe called at the house of Brother Fellows on our way out. Brother\r\nFellows lived about four miles from Carthage. While at Brother Fellows’\r\nhouse, Captain Dunn, accompanied by Mr. Coolie, one of the governor’s\r\naid-de-camps, came up from Carthage _en route_ for Nauvoo with a\r\nrequisition from the governor for the state arms. We all returned to\r\nNauvoo with them; the governor’s request was complied with, and, after\r\ntaking some refreshments, we all returned to proceed to Carthage. We\r\narrived there late in the night. A great deal of excitement prevailed\r\non and after our arrival. The governor had received into his company\r\nall of the companies that had been in the mob; these fellows were\r\nriotous and disorderly, hallooing, yelling, and whooping about the\r\nstreets like Indians, many of them intoxicated; the whole presented a\r\nscene of rowdyism and low-bred ruffianism only found among mobocrats\r\nand desperadoes, and entirely revolting to the best feelings of\r\nhumanity. The governor made a speech to them to the effect that he\r\nwould show Joseph and Hyrum Smith to them in the morning. About here\r\nthe companies with the governor were drawn up into line, and General\r\nDemming, I think, took Joseph by the arm and Hyrum (Arnold says that\r\nJoseph took the governor’s arm), and as he passed through between the\r\nranks, the governor leading in front, very politely introduced them as\r\nGeneral Joseph Smith and General Hyrum Smith.[242] All were orderly\r\nand courteous except one company of mobocrats--the Carthage Grays--who\r\nseemed to find fault on account of too much honor being paid to the\r\nMormons. There was afterward a row between the companies, and they came\r\npretty near having a fight; the more orderly not feeling disposed to\r\nendorse or submit to the rowdyism of the mobocrats. The result was that\r\nGeneral Demming, who was very much of a gentleman, ordered the Carthage\r\nGrays, a company under the command of Captain Smith, a magistrate in\r\nCarthage, and a most violent mobocrat, under arrest. This matter,\r\nhowever, was shortly afterward adjusted, and the difficulty settled\r\nbetween them. The mayor, aldermen, councilors, as well as the marshal\r\nof the city of Nauvoo, together with some persons who had assisted\r\nthe marshal in removing the press in Nauvoo, appeared before Justice\r\nSmith, the aforesaid captain and mobocrat, to again answer the charge\r\nof destroying the press; but as there was so much excitement, and as\r\nthe man was an unprincipled villain before whom we were to have our\r\nhearing, we thought it most prudent to give bail, and consequently\r\nbecame security for each other in $500 bonds each, to appear before the\r\nCounty Court at its next session. We had engaged as counsel a lawyer by\r\nthe name of Wood, of Burlington, Iowa; and Reed, I think, of Madison,\r\nIowa. After some little discussion the bonds were signed, and we were\r\nall dismissed.\r\n\r\n  [242] The “Deserét News” gives the following account of Joseph and\r\n  Hyrum Smith’s passing through the troops in Carthage:\r\n\r\n  “Carthage, June 25th, 1844.\r\n\r\n  “Quarter past 9. The governor came and invited Joseph to walk with\r\n  him through the troops. Joseph solicited a few moment’s private\r\n  conversation with him, which the governor refused.\r\n\r\n  “While refusing, the governor looked down at his shoes, as though\r\n  he was ashamed. They then walked through the crowd, with Brigadier\r\n  General Miner, R. Demming, and Dr. Richards, to General Demming’s\r\n  quarters. The people appeared quiet until a company of Carthage\r\n  Grays flocked round the doors of General Demming in an uproarious\r\n  manner, of which notice was sent to the governor. In the mean time\r\n  the governor had ordered the M‘Donough troops to be drawn up in line,\r\n  for Joseph and Hyrum to pass in front of them, they having requested\r\n  that they might have a clear view of the General Smiths. _Joseph had\r\n  a conversation with the governor for about ten minutes, when he again\r\n  pledged the faith of the state that he and his friends should be\r\n  protected from violence._\r\n\r\n  “Robinson, the post-master, said, on report of martial law being\r\n  proclaimed in Nauvoo, he had stopped the mail, and notified the\r\n  post-master general of the state of things in Hancock County.\r\n\r\n  “From the general’s quarters Joseph and Hyrum went in front of the\r\n  lines, in a hollow square of a company of Carthage Grays; at seven\r\n  minutes before 10 they arrived in front of the lines, and passed\r\n  before the whole, Joseph being on the right of General Demming and\r\n  Hyrum on his left, Elders Richards, Taylor, and Phelps following.\r\n  Joseph and Hyrum were introduced by Governor Ford about twenty times\r\n  along the line as General Joseph Smith and General Hyrum Smith, the\r\n  governor walking in front on the left. The Carthage Grays refused to\r\n  receive them by that introduction, and some of the officers threw\r\n  up their hats, drew their swords, and said they would introduce\r\n  themselves to the damned Mormons in a different style. The governor\r\n  mildly entreated them not to act so rudely, but their excitement\r\n  increased; the governor, however, succeeded in pacifying them by\r\n  making a speech, and promising them that they should have ‘full\r\n  satisfaction.’ General Smith and party returned to their lodgings at\r\n  five minutes past 10.”--_Des. News_, No. 35, Nov. 4, 1857, page 274.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately after our dismissal, two men--Augustine Spencer and\r\nNorton--two worthless fellows, whose words would not have been taken\r\nfor five cents, and the first of whom had a short time previously\r\nbeen before the mayor in Nauvoo for maltreating a lame brother, made\r\naffidavits that Joseph and Hyrum Smith were guilty of treason; and\r\na writ was accordingly issued for their arrest, and the constable\r\nBettesworth, a rough, unprincipled man, wished immediately to hurry\r\nthem away to prison without any hearing. His rude, uncouth manner in\r\nthe administration of what he considered the duties of his office made\r\nhim exceedingly repulsive to us all. But, independent of these acts,\r\nthe proceedings in this case were altogether illegal. Providing the\r\ncourt was sincere, which it was not, and providing these men’s oaths\r\nwere true, and that Joseph and Hyrum were guilty of treason, still the\r\nwhole course was illegal.\r\n\r\nThe magistrate made out a mittimus, and committed them to prison\r\nwithout a hearing, which he had no right legally to do. The statute of\r\nIllinois expressly provides that “all men shall have a hearing before\r\na magistrate before they shall be committed to prison;” and Mr. Robert\r\nH. Smith, the magistrate, had made out a mittimus committing them to\r\nprison contrary to law without such hearing. As I was informed of this\r\nillegal proceeding, I went immediately to the governor and informed him\r\nof it. Whether he was apprised of it before or not, I do not know; but\r\nmy opinion is that he was.\r\n\r\nI represented to him the characters of the parties who had made oath,\r\nthe outrageous nature of the charge, the indignity offered to men\r\nin the position which they occupied, and declared to him that he\r\nknew very well it was a vexatious proceeding, and that the accused\r\nwere not guilty of any such crime. The governor replied, “He was\r\nvery sorry that the thing had occurred; that he did not believe the\r\ncharges, but that he thought the best thing to be done was to let the\r\nlaw take its course.” I then reminded him that we had come out there\r\nat his instance, not to satisfy the law, which we had done before,\r\nbut the prejudices of the people, in relation to the affair of the\r\npress; that at his instance we had given bonds, which we could not by\r\nlaw be required to do to satisfy the people, and that it was asking\r\ntoo much to require gentlemen in their position in life to suffer\r\nthe degradation of being immured in a jail at the instance of such\r\nworthless scoundrels as those who had made this affidavit. The governor\r\nreplied “that it was an unpleasant affair, and looked hard; but that\r\nit was a matter over which he had no control, as it belonged to the\r\njudiciary; that he, as the executive, could not interfere with their\r\nproceedings, and that he had no doubt but that they would immediately\r\nbe dismissed.” I told him “that we had looked to him for protection\r\nfrom such insults, and that I thought we had a right to do so from\r\nthe solemn promises which he had made to me and to Dr. Bernhisel in\r\nrelation to our coming without guard or arms; that we had relied upon\r\nhis faith, and had a right to expect him to fulfill his engagements\r\nafter we had placed ourselves implicitly under his care, and complied\r\nwith all his requests, although extra-judicial.”\r\n\r\nHe replied “that he would detail a guard, if we required it, and see\r\nus protected, but that he could not interfere with the judiciary.” I\r\nexpressed my dissatisfaction at the course taken, and told him “that,\r\nif we were to be subject to mob rule, and to be dragged, contrary to\r\nlaw, into prison at the instance of every infernal scoundrel whose\r\noaths could be bought for a dram of whisky, his protection availed very\r\nlittle, and we had miscalculated his promises.”\r\n\r\nSeeing there was no prospect of redress from the governor, I returned\r\nto the room, and found the constable Bettesworth very urgent to\r\nhurry Brothers Joseph and Hyrum to prison, while the brethren were\r\nremonstrating with him. At the same time a great rabble was gathered in\r\nthe streets and around the door, and from the rowdyism manifested I was\r\nafraid there was a design to murder the prisoners on the way to jail.\r\n\r\nWithout conferring with any person, my next feeling was to procure a\r\nguard, and, seeing a man habited as a soldier in the room, I went to\r\nhim and said, “I am afraid there is a design against the lives of the\r\nMessrs. Smith; will you go immediately and bring your captain; and, if\r\nnot convenient, any other captain of a company, and I will pay you well\r\nfor your trouble?” He said he would, and departed forthwith, and soon\r\nreturned with his captain, whose name I have forgotten, and introduced\r\nhim to me. I told him of my fears, and requested him immediately to\r\nfetch his company; he departed forthwith, and arrived at the door with\r\nthem just at the time when the constable was hurrying the brethren\r\ndown stairs. A number of the brethren went along, together with one or\r\ntwo strangers; and all of us, safely lodged in prison, remained there\r\nduring the night.\r\n\r\nAt the request of Joseph Smith for an interview with the governor, he\r\ncame the next morning, Thursday, June 26th, at half past 9 o’clock,\r\naccompanied by Colonel Geddes, when a lengthy conversation was\r\nentered into in relation to the existing difficulties; and after\r\nsome preliminary remarks, at the governor’s request, Brother Joseph\r\ngave him a general outline of the state of affairs in relation to\r\nour difficulties, the excited state of the country, the tumultuous\r\nmobocratic movements of our enemies, the precautionary measures used by\r\nhimself (Joseph Smith), the acts of the city council, the destruction\r\nof the press, and the moves of the mob and ourselves up to that time.\r\n\r\nThe following report is, I believe, substantially correct:\r\n\r\n_Governor._ “General Smith, I believe you have given me a general\r\noutline of the difficulties that have existed in the country in\r\nthe documents forwarded to me by Dr. Bernhisel and Mr. Taylor;\r\nbut, unfortunately, there seems to be a great discrepancy between\r\nyour statements and those of your enemies. It is true that you are\r\nsubstantiated by evidence and affidavit, but for such an extraordinary\r\nexcitement as that which is now in the country there must be some\r\ncause, and I attribute the last outbreak to the destruction of the\r\n‘Expositor,’ and to your refusal to comply with the writ issued by\r\nEsquire Morrison. The press in the United States is looked upon as the\r\ngreat bulwark of American freedom, and its destruction in Nauvoo was\r\nrepresented and looked upon as a high-handed measure, and manifests\r\nto the people a disposition on your part to suppress the liberty of\r\nspeech and of the press. This, with your refusal to comply with the\r\nrequisitions of a writ, I conceive to be the principal cause of this\r\ndifficulty; and you are moreover represented to me as turbulent, and\r\ndefiant of the laws and institutions of your country.”\r\n\r\n_General Smith._ “Governor Ford, you, sir, as governor of this state,\r\nare aware of the persecutions that I have endured. You know well that\r\nour course has been peaceable and law-abiding, for I have furnished\r\nthis state ever since our settlement here with sufficient evidence\r\nof my pacific intentions, and those of the people with whom I am\r\nassociated, by the endurance of every conceivable indignity and lawless\r\noutrage perpetrated upon me and upon this people since our settlement\r\nhere; and you yourself know that I have kept you well posted in\r\nrelation to all matters associated with the late difficulties. If you\r\nhave not got some of my communications, it has not been my fault.\r\n\r\n“Agreeably to your orders, I assembled the Nauvoo Legion for the\r\nprotection of Nauvoo and the surrounding country against an armed band\r\nof marauders; and ever since they have been mustered I have almost\r\ndaily communicated with you in regard to all the leading events that\r\nhave transpired; and whether in the capacity of mayor of the city, or\r\nlieutenant general of the Nauvoo Legion, I have striven, according\r\nto the best of my judgment, to preserve the peace and to administer\r\neven-handed justice; but my motives are impugned, my acts are\r\nmisconstrued, and I am grossly and wickedly misrepresented. I suppose\r\nI am indebted for my incarceration to the oath of a worthless man,\r\nwho was arraigned before me and fined for abusing and maltreating his\r\nlame, helpless brother. That I should be charged by you, sir, who know\r\nbetter, of acting contrary to law, is to me a matter of surprise. Was\r\nit the Mormons or our enemies who first commenced these difficulties?\r\nYou know well it was not us; and when this turbulent, outrageous people\r\ncommenced their insurrectionary movements, I made you acquainted with\r\nthem officially, and asked your advice, and have followed strictly your\r\ncounsel in every particular. Who ordered out the Nauvoo Legion? I did,\r\nunder your direction. For what purpose? To suppress the insurrectionary\r\nmovements. It was at your instance, sir, that I issued a proclamation\r\ncalling upon the Nauvoo Legion to be in readiness at a moment’s warning\r\nto guard against the incursions of mobs, and gave an order to Jonathan\r\nDunham, acting major general, to that effect.\r\n\r\n“Am I, then, to be charged for the acts of others? and because\r\nlawlessness and mobocracy abound, am I, when carrying out your\r\ninstructions, to be charged with not abiding law? Why is it that I\r\nmust be made accountable for other men’s acts? If there is trouble in\r\nthe country, neither I nor my people made it; and all that we have\r\never done, after much endurance on our part, is to maintain and uphold\r\nthe Constitution and institutions of our country, and to protect an\r\ninjured, innocent, and persecuted people against misrule and mob\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\n“Concerning the destruction of the press to which you refer, men may\r\ndiffer somewhat in their opinions about it; but can it be supposed that\r\nafter all the indignities to which they have been subjected outside,\r\nthat people could suffer a set of worthless vagabonds to come into\r\ntheir city, and, right under their own eyes and protection, vilify and\r\ncalumniate not only themselves, but the character of their wives and\r\ndaughters, as was impudently and unblushingly done in that infamous and\r\nfilthy sheet?\r\n\r\n“There is not a city in the United States that would have suffered such\r\nan indignity for twenty-four hours. Our whole people were indignant,\r\nand loudly called upon our city authorities for a redress of their\r\ngrievances, which, if not attended to, they themselves would have\r\ntaken into their own hands, and have summarily punished the audacious\r\nwretches as they deserved. The principles of equal rights that have\r\nbeen instilled into our bosoms from our cradles as American citizens\r\nforbid us submitting to every foul indignity, and succumbing and\r\npandering to wretches so infamous as these. But, independent of this,\r\nthe course that we pursued we considered to be strictly legal; for,\r\nnotwithstanding the result, we were anxious to be governed strictly by\r\nlaw, and therefore we convened the city council; and being desirous\r\nin our deliberations to abide by law, we summoned legal counsel to be\r\npresent on the occasion. Upon investigating the matter, we found that\r\nour city charter gave us power to remove all nuisances. Furthermore,\r\nafter consulting Blackstone upon what might be considered a nuisance,\r\nit appeared that that distinguished lawyer, who is considered\r\nauthority, I believe, in all our courts, states among other things that\r\n‘a libelous and filthy press may be considered a nuisance, and abated\r\nas such.’ Here, then, one of the most eminent English barristers, whose\r\nworks are considered standard with us, declares that a libelous and\r\nfilthy press may be considered a nuisance; and our own charter, given\r\nus by the Legislature of this state, gives us the power to remove\r\nnuisances; and by ordering that press to be abated as a nuisance, we\r\nconceived that we were acting strictly in accordance with law. We made\r\nthat order in our corporate capacity, and the city marshal carried it\r\nout. It is possible there may have been some better way, but I must\r\nconfess that I could not see it.\r\n\r\n“In relation to the writ served upon us, we were willing to abide\r\nthe consequences of our own acts, but were unwilling, in answering\r\na writ of that kind, to submit to illegal exactions, sought to be\r\nimposed upon us under the pretense of law, when we knew they were in\r\nopen violation of it. When that document was presented to me by Mr.\r\nBettesworth, I offered, in the presence of more than twenty persons,\r\nto go to any other magistrate, either in our city, in Appanoose, or\r\nin any other place where we should be safe, but we all refused to\r\nput ourselves into the power of a mob. What right had that constable\r\nto refuse our request? He had none according to law; for you know,\r\nGovernor Ford, that the statute law in Illinois is, that the parties\r\nserved with the writ ‘shall go before him who issued it, or some other\r\njustice of the peace.’ Why, then, should we be dragged to Carthage,\r\nwhere the law does not compel us to go? Does not this look like many\r\nothers of our persecutions with which you are acquainted? and have we\r\nnot a right to expect foul play? This very act was a breach of law\r\non his part, an assumption of power that did not belong to him, and\r\nan attempt, at least, to deprive us of our legal and constitutional\r\nrights and privileges. What could we do, under the circumstances,\r\ndifferent from what we did do? We sued for, and obtained a writ of\r\nhabeas corpus from the Municipal Court, by which we were delivered from\r\nthe hands of Constable Bettesworth, and brought before and acquitted\r\nby the Municipal Court. After our acquittal, in a conversation with\r\nJudge Thomas, although he considered the acts of the party illegal, he\r\nadvised that, to satisfy the people, we had better go before another\r\nmagistrate who was not in our Church. In accordance with his advice,\r\nwe went before Esquire Wells, with whom you are well acquainted; both\r\nparties were present, witnesses were called on both sides, the case\r\nwas fully investigated, and we were again dismissed. And what is this\r\npretended desire to enforce law, and wherefore are these lying, base\r\nrumors put into circulation but to seek through mob influence, under\r\npretense of law, to make us submit to requisitions which are contrary\r\nto law and subversive of every principle of justice? And when you, sir,\r\nrequired us to come out here, we came, not because it was legal, but\r\nbecause you required it of us, and we were desirous of showing to you,\r\nand to all men, that we shrunk not from the most rigid investigation of\r\nour acts. We certainly did expect other treatment than to be immured in\r\na jail at the instance of these men, and I think, from your plighted\r\nfaith, we had a right so to expect, after disbanding our own forces,\r\nand putting ourselves entirely in your hands. And now, after having\r\nfulfilled my part, sir, as a man and an American citizen, I call upon\r\nyou, Governor Ford, to deliver us from this place, and rescue us\r\nfrom this outrage that is sought to be practiced upon us by a set of\r\ninfamous scoundrels.”\r\n\r\n_Governor Ford._ “But you have placed men under arrest, detained men as\r\nprisoners, and given passes to others, some of which I have seen.”\r\n\r\n_John P. Green, City Marshal._ “Perhaps I can explain. Since these\r\ndifficulties have commenced, you are aware that we have been placed\r\nunder very peculiar circumstances; our city has been placed under a\r\nvery rigid police guard; in addition to this, frequent guards have\r\nbeen placed outside the city to prevent any sudden surprise, and those\r\nguards have questioned suspected or suspicious persons as to their\r\nbusiness. To strangers, in some instances, passes have been given to\r\nprevent difficulty in passing those guards; it is some of these passes\r\nthat you have seen. No person, sir, has been imprisoned without a legal\r\ncause in our city.”\r\n\r\n_Governor._ “Why did you not give a more speedy answer to the posse\r\nthat I sent out?”\r\n\r\n_General Smith._ “We had matters of importance to consult upon; your\r\nletter showed any thing but an amiable spirit. We have suffered\r\nimmensely in Missouri from mobs, in loss of property, imprisonment,\r\nand otherwise. It took some time for us to weigh duly these matters;\r\nwe could not decide upon matters of such importance immediately, and\r\nyour posse were too hasty in returning; we were consulting for a large\r\npeople, and vast interests were at stake. We had been outrageously\r\nimposed upon, and knew not how far we could trust any one; besides, a\r\nquestion necessarily arose, How shall we come? Your request was that we\r\nshould come unarmed. It became a matter of serious importance to decide\r\nhow far promises could be trusted, and how far we were safe from mob\r\nviolence.”\r\n\r\n_Colonel Geddes._ “It certainly did look, from all I have heard, from\r\nthe general spirit of violence and mobocracy that here prevails, that\r\nit was not safe for you to come unprotected.”\r\n\r\n_Governor Ford._ “I think that sufficient time was not allowed by the\r\nposse for you to consult and get ready. They were too hasty; but I\r\nsuppose they found themselves bound by their orders. I think, too,\r\nthere is a great deal of truth in what you say, and your reasoning\r\nis plausible, but I must beg leave to differ from you in relation to\r\nthe acts of the city council. That council, in my opinion, had no\r\nright to act in a legislative capacity and in that of the judiciary.\r\nThey should have passed a law in relation to the matter, and then the\r\nMunicipal Court, upon complaint, could have removed it; but for the\r\ncity council to take upon themselves the law-making and the execution\r\nof the law is in my opinion wrong; besides, these men ought to have had\r\na hearing before their property was destroyed; to destroy it without\r\nwas an infringement on their rights; besides, it is so contrary to\r\nthe feelings of American people to interfere with the press. And,\r\nfurthermore, I can not but think that it would have been more judicious\r\nfor you to have gone with Mr. Bettesworth to Carthage, notwithstanding\r\nthe law did not require it. Concerning your being in jail, I am sorry\r\nfor that; I wish it had been otherwise. I hope you will soon be\r\nreleased, but I can not interfere.”\r\n\r\n_Joseph Smith._ “Governor Ford, allow me, sir, to bring one thing to\r\nyour mind that you seem to have overlooked. You state that you think it\r\nwould have been better for us to have submitted to the requisition of\r\nConstable Bettesworth, and to have gone to Carthage. Do you not know,\r\nsir, that that writ was served at the instance of an ‘anti-Mormon’ mob,\r\nwho had passed resolutions, and published them, to the effect that they\r\nwould exterminate the ‘Mormon’ leaders? and are you not informed that\r\nCaptain Anderson was not only threatened when coming to Nauvoo, but\r\nhad a gun fired at his boat by this said mob in Warsaw when coming up\r\nto Nauvoo, and that this very thing was made use of as a means to get\r\nus into their hands; and we could not, without taking an armed force\r\nwith us, go there without, according to their published declarations,\r\ngoing into the jaws of death? To have taken a force would only have\r\nfanned the excitement, and they would have stated that we wanted to\r\nuse intimidation; therefore we thought it the most judicious to avail\r\nourselves of the protection of law.”\r\n\r\n_Governor Ford._ “I see, I see.”\r\n\r\n_Joseph Smith._ “Furthermore, in relation to the press, you say that\r\nyou differ from me in opinion. Be it so; the thing, after all, is only\r\na legal difficulty, and the courts, I should judge, are competent to\r\ndecide on that matter. If our act was illegal, we are willing to meet\r\nit; and although I can not see the distinction that you draw about\r\nthe acts of the city council, and what difference it could have made\r\nin point of fact, law, or justice between the city councils acting\r\ntogether or separate, or how much more legal it would have been for the\r\nMunicipal Court, who were a part of the city council, to act separate\r\ninstead of with the councilors, yet, if it is deemed that we did a\r\nwrong in destroying that press, we refuse not to pay for it; we are\r\ndesirous to fulfill the law in every particular, and are responsible\r\nfor our acts. You say that the parties ought to have had a hearing.\r\nHad it been a civil suit, this, of course, would have been proper; but\r\nthere was a flagrant violation of every principle of right--a nuisance;\r\nand it was abated on the same principle that any nuisance, stench, or\r\nputrefied carcass would have been removed. Our first step, therefore,\r\nwas to stop the foul, noisome, filthy sheet, and then the next in our\r\nopinion would have been to have prosecuted the man for a breach of\r\npublic decency. And furthermore, again let me say, Governor Ford, I\r\nshall look to you for our protection. I believe you are talking of\r\ngoing to Nauvoo; if you go, sir, I wish to go along. I refuse not to\r\nanswer any law, but I do not consider myself safe here.”\r\n\r\n_Governor._ “I am in hopes that you will be acquitted, and if I go I\r\nwill certainly take you along. I do not, however, apprehend danger. I\r\nthink you are perfectly safe either here or any where else. I can not,\r\nhowever, interfere with the law. I am placed in peculiar circumstances,\r\nand seem to be blamed by all parties.”\r\n\r\n_Joseph Smith._ “Governor Ford, I ask nothing but what is legal; I\r\nhave a right to expect protection, at least from you; for, independent\r\nof law, you have pledged your faith and that of the state for my\r\nprotection, and I wish to go to Nauvoo.”\r\n\r\nGovernor. “And you shall have protection, General Smith. I did not make\r\nthis promise without consulting my officers, who all pledged their\r\nhonor to its fulfillment. I do not know that I shall go to-morrow to\r\nNauvoo, but if I do I will take you along.”\r\n\r\nAt a quarter past ten o’clock the governor left.\r\n\r\nAt about half past twelve o’clock, Mr. Reed, one of Joseph’s counsel,\r\ncame in, apparently much elated; he stated that, “upon an examination\r\nof the law, he found that the magistrate had transcended his\r\njurisdiction, and that, having committed them without an examination,\r\nhis jurisdiction ended; that he had him upon a pin-hook; that he ought\r\nto have examined them before he committed them, and that, having\r\nviolated the law in this particular, he had no farther power over them;\r\nfor, once committed, they were out of his jurisdiction, as the power\r\nof the magistrate extended no farther than their committal, and that\r\nnow they could not be brought out except at the regular session of the\r\nCircuit Court, or by a writ of habeas corpus; but that if Justice Smith\r\nwould consent to go to Nauvoo for trial, he would compromise matters\r\nwith him, and overlook this matter.”\r\n\r\nMr. Reed farther stated that “the ‘anti-Mormons,’ or mob, had concocted\r\na scheme to get out a writ from Missouri, with a demand upon Governor\r\nFord for the arrest of Joseph Smith and his conveyance to Missouri, and\r\nthat a man by the name of Wilson had returned from Missouri the night\r\nbefore the burning of the press for this purpose.”\r\n\r\nAt half past two o’clock Constable Bettesworth came to the jail with\r\na man named Simpson, professing to have some order, but he would not\r\nsend up his name, and the guard would not let him pass. Dr. Bernhisel\r\nand Brother Wasson went to inform the governor and council of this. At\r\nabout twenty minutes to three Dr. Bernhisel returned, and stated that\r\nhe thought the governor was doing all he could. At about ten minutes to\r\nthree Hyrum Kimball appeared with news from Nauvoo.\r\n\r\nSoon after Constable Bettesworth came with an order from Esquire Smith\r\nto convey the prisoners to the court-house for trial. He was informed\r\nthat the process was illegal, that they had been placed there contrary\r\nto law, and that they refused to come unless by legal process. I was\r\ninformed that Justice Smith (who was also Captain of the Carthage\r\nGrays) went to the governor and informed him of the matter, and that\r\nthe governor replied, “You have your forces, and of course can use\r\nthem.” The constable certainly did return, accompanied by a guard of\r\narmed men, and by force, and under protest, hurried the prisoners to\r\nthe court.\r\n\r\nAbout four o’clock the case was called by Captain Robert F. Smith, J.\r\nP. The counsel of the prisoners called for subpœnas to bring witnesses.\r\nAt twenty-five minutes past four he took a copy of the order to bring\r\nthe prisoners from jail to trial, and afterward he took names of\r\nwitnesses.\r\n\r\nCounsel present for the state: Higbee, Skinner, Sharpe, Emmons, and\r\nMorrison. Twenty-five minutes to five the writ was returned as served,\r\nJune 25th.\r\n\r\nMany remarks were made at the court that I paid but little attention\r\nto, as I considered the whole thing illegal and a complete burlesque.\r\nWood objected to the proceedings in toto, in consequence of its\r\nillegality, showing that the prisoners were not only illegally\r\ncommitted, but that, being once committed, the magistrate had no\r\nfarther power over them; but as it was the same magistrate before whom\r\nhe was pleading who imprisoned them contrary to law, and the same who,\r\nas captain, forced them from jail, his arguments availed but little.\r\nHe then urged that the prisoners be remanded until witnesses could be\r\nhad, and applied for a continuance for that purpose. Skinner suggested\r\nuntil twelve o’clock next day. Wood again demanded until witnesses\r\ncould be obtained; that the court meet at a specified time, and that,\r\nif witnesses were not present, again adjourn, without calling the\r\nprisoners. After various remarks from Reed, Skinner, and others, the\r\ncourt stated that the writ was served yesterday, and that it will give\r\nuntil to-morrow at twelve M. to get witnesses.\r\n\r\nWe then returned to jail. Immediately after our return Dr. Bernhisel\r\nwent to the governor, and obtained from him an order for us to occupy\r\na large open room containing a bedstead. I rather think that the same\r\nroom had been appropriated to the use of debtors; at any rate, there\r\nwas free access to the jailer’s house, and no bars or locks except\r\nsuch as might be on the outside door of the jail. The jailer, Mr.\r\nGeorge W. Steghall, and his wife, manifested a disposition to make us\r\nas comfortable as they could; we ate at their table, which was well\r\nprovided, and of course paid for it.\r\n\r\nI do not remember the names of all who were with us that night and the\r\nnext morning in jail, for several went and came; among those that we\r\nconsidered stationary were Stephen Markham, John S. Fulmer, Captain\r\nDan Jones, Dr. Williard Richards, and myself. Dr. Bernhisel says that\r\nhe was there from Wednesday in the afternoon until eleven o’clock next\r\nday. We were, however, visited by numerous friends, among whom were\r\nUncle John Smith, Hyrum Kimball, Cyrus H. Wheelock, besides lawyers,\r\nas counsel. There was also a great variety of conversation, which was\r\nrather desultory than otherwise, and referred to circumstances that had\r\ntranspired; our former and present grievances; the spirit of the troops\r\naround us, and the disposition of the governor; the devising for legal\r\nand other plans for deliverance; the nature of testimony required; the\r\ngathering of proper witnesses; and a variety of other topics, including\r\nour religious hopes, etc.\r\n\r\nDuring one of these conversations Dr. Richards remarked: “Brother\r\nJoseph, it is necessary that you die in this matter, and if they will\r\ntake me in your stead, I will suffer for you.” At another time, when\r\nconversing about deliverance, I said, “Brother Joseph, if you will\r\npermit it, and say the word, I will have you out of this prison in\r\nfive hours, if the jail has to come down to do it.” My idea was to go\r\nto Nauvoo, and collect a force sufficient, as I considered the whole\r\naffair a legal farce, and a flagrant outrage upon our liberty and\r\nrights. Brother Joseph refused.\r\n\r\nElder Cyrus Wheelock came in to see us, and when he was about leaving\r\ndrew a small pistol, a six-shooter, from his pocket, remarking\r\nat the same time, “Would any of you like to have this?” Brother\r\nJoseph immediately replied, “Yes, give it to me;” whereupon he took\r\nthe pistol, and put it in his pantaloons pocket. The pistol was a\r\nsix-shooting revolver, of Allen’s patent; it belonged to me, and was\r\none that I furnished to Brother Wheelock when he talked of going with\r\nme to the East, previous to our coming to Carthage. I have it now in\r\nmy possession. Brother Wheelock went out on some errand, and was not\r\nsuffered to return. The report of the governor having gone to Nauvoo\r\nwithout taking the prisoners along with him caused very unpleasant\r\nfeelings, as we were apprised that we were left to the tender mercies\r\nof the Carthage Grays, a company strictly mobocratic, and whom we knew\r\nto be our most deadly enemies, and their captain, Esquire Smith, was a\r\nmost unprincipled villain. Besides this, all the mob forces, comprising\r\nthe governor’s troops, were dismissed, with the exception of one or two\r\ncompanies, which the governor took with him to Nauvoo. The great part\r\nof the mob was liberated, the remainder was our guard.\r\n\r\nWe looked upon it not only as a breach of faith on the part of\r\nthe governor, but also as an indication of a desire to insult us,\r\nif nothing more, by leaving us in the proximity of such men. The\r\nprevention of Wheelock’s return was among the first of their hostile\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\nColonel Markham then went out, and he was also prevented from\r\nreturning. He was very angry at this, but the mob paid no attention\r\nto him; they drove him out of town at the point of the bayonet, and\r\nthreatened to shoot him if he returned; he went, I am informed, to\r\nNauvoo for the purpose of raising a company of men for our protection.\r\nBrother Fulmer went to Nauvoo after witnesses: it is my opinion that\r\nBrother Wheelock did also.\r\n\r\nSome time after dinner we sent for some wine. It has been reported by\r\nsome that this was taken as a sacrament. It was no such thing; our\r\nspirits were generally dull and heavy, and it was sent for to revive\r\nus. I think it was Captain Jones who went after it, but they would not\r\nsuffer him to return. I believe we all drank of the wine, and gave some\r\nto one or two of the prison guards. We all of us felt unusually dull\r\nand languid, with a remarkable depression of spirits. In consonance\r\nwith those feelings I sang the following song, that had lately been\r\nintroduced into Nauvoo, entitled, “A poor wayfaring man of grief,” etc.\r\n\r\n    1. A poor wayfaring man of grief\r\n      Hath often cross’d me on my way,\r\n    Who sued so humbly for relief\r\n      That I could never answer Nay.\r\n\r\n    2. I had not power to ask his name,\r\n    Whither he went, or whence he came;\r\n    Yet there was something in his eye\r\n    That won my love, I know not why.\r\n\r\n    3. Once, when my scanty meal was spread,\r\n      He enter’d--not a word he spake!\r\n    Just perishing for want of bread;\r\n      I gave him all: he bless’d it, brake,\r\n\r\n    4. And ate, but gave me part again;\r\n    Mine was an angel’s portion then,\r\n    For while I fed with eager haste,\r\n    The crust was manna to my taste.\r\n\r\n    5. I spied him where a fountain burst\r\n      Clear from the rock--his strength was gone--\r\n    The heedless water mock’d his thirst;\r\n      He heard it, saw it hurrying on.\r\n\r\n    6. I ran and raised the suff’rer up;\r\n    Thrice from the stream he drain’d my cup,\r\n    Dipp’d, and return’d it running o’er;\r\n    I drank, and never thirsted more.\r\n\r\n    7. ’Twas night; the floods were out; it blew\r\n      A winter hurricane aloof;\r\n    I heard his voice abroad, and flew\r\n      To bid him welcome to my roof.\r\n\r\n    8. I warm’d, I clothed, I cheer’d my guest,\r\n    I laid him on my couch to rest;\r\n    Then made the earth my bed, and seem’d\r\n    In Eden’s garden while I dream’d.\r\n\r\n    9. Stripp’d, wounded, beaten nigh to death,\r\n      I found him by the highway side;\r\n    I roused his pulse, brought back his breath,\r\n      Revived his spirit, and supplied\r\n\r\n    10. Wine, oil, refreshment: he was heal’d;\r\n    I had myself a wound conceal’d,\r\n    But from that hour forgot the smart,\r\n    And peace bound up my broken heart.\r\n\r\n    11. In prison I saw him next, condemn’d\r\n      To meet a traitor’s doom at morn;\r\n    The tide of lying tongues I stemm’d,\r\n      And honor’d him ’mid shame and scorn.\r\n\r\n    12. My friendship’s utmost zeal to try,\r\n    He asked if I for him would die;\r\n    The flesh was weak; my blood ran chill;\r\n    But the free spirit cried “I will.”\r\n\r\n    13. Then in a moment to my view\r\n      The stranger started from disguise;\r\n    The tokens in his hands I knew;\r\n      The Savior stood before mine eyes.\r\n\r\n    14. He spake--and my poor name he named--\r\n    “Of me thou hast not been ashamed;\r\n    These deeds shall thy memorial be;\r\n    Fear not; thou didst them unto me.”\r\n\r\nThe song is pathetic, and the tune quite plaintive, and was very much\r\nin accordance with our feelings at the time, for our spirits were all\r\ndepressed, dull, and gloomy, and surcharged with indefinite ominous\r\nforebodings. After a lapse of some time, Brother Hyrum requested me\r\nagain to sing that song. I replied, “Brother Hyrum, I do not feel like\r\nsinging;” when he remarked, “Oh! never mind; commence singing, and you\r\nwill get the spirit of it.” At his request I did so. Soon afterward\r\nI was sitting at one of the front windows of the jail, when I saw a\r\nnumber of men, with painted faces, coming round the corner of the\r\njail, and aiming toward the stairs. The other brethren had seen the\r\nsame, for, as I went to the door, I found Brother Hyrum Smith and Dr.\r\nRichards already leaning against it; they both pressed against the door\r\nwith their shoulders to prevent its being opened, as the lock and latch\r\nwere comparatively useless. While in this position, the mob, who had\r\ncome up stairs, and strove to open the door, probably thought it was\r\nlocked, and fired a ball through the keyhole; at this Dr. Richards and\r\nBrother Hyrum leaped back from the door, with their faces toward it;\r\nalmost instantly another ball passed through the panel of the door, and\r\nstruck Brother Hyrum on the left side of the nose, entering his face\r\nand head; simultaneously, at the same instant, another ball from the\r\noutside entered his back, passing through his body and striking his\r\nwatch. The ball came from the back, through the jail window, opposite\r\nthe door, and must, from its range, have been fired from the Carthage\r\nGrays, as the balls of fire-arms, shot close by the jail, would have\r\nentered the ceiling, we being in the second story, and there never\r\nwas a time after that Hyrum could have received the latter wound.\r\nImmediately, when the balls struck him, he fell flat on his back,\r\ncrying as he fell, “I am a dead man!” He never moved afterward.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget the feeling of deep sympathy and regard manifested\r\nin the countenance of Brother Joseph as he drew nigh to Hyrum, and,\r\nleaning over him, exclaimed, “Oh! my poor, dear brother Hyrum.” He,\r\nhowever, instantly arose, and with a firm, quick step, and a determined\r\nexpression of countenance, approached the door, and pulling the\r\nsix-shooter left by Brother Wheelock from his pocket, opened the door\r\nslightly, and snapped the pistol six successive times; only three of\r\nthe barrels, however, were discharged. I afterward understood that two\r\nor three were wounded by these discharges, two of whom, I am informed,\r\ndied. I had in my hands a large, strong hickory stick, brought there\r\nby Brother Markham, and left by him, which I had seized as soon as I\r\nsaw the mob approach; and while Brother Joseph was firing the pistol,\r\nI stood close behind him. As soon as he had discharged it he stepped\r\nback, and I immediately took his place next the door, while he occupied\r\nthe one I had done while he was shooting. Brother Richards, at this\r\ntime, had a knotty walking-stick in his hands belonging to me, and\r\nstood next to Brother Joseph, a little farther from the door, in an\r\noblique direction, apparently to avoid the rake of the fire from the\r\ndoor. The firing of Brother Joseph made our assailants pause for a\r\nmoment; very soon after, however, they pushed the door some distance\r\nopen, and protruded and discharged their guns into the room, when I\r\nparried them off with my stick, giving another direction to the balls.\r\n\r\nIt certainly was a terrible scene: streams of fire as thick as my arm\r\npassed by me as these men fired, and, unarmed as we were, it looked\r\nlike certain death. I remember feeling as though my time had come,\r\nbut I do not know when, in any critical position, I was more calm,\r\nunruffled, and energetic, and acted with more promptness and decision.\r\nIt certainly was far from pleasant to be so near the muzzles of those\r\nfire-arms as they belched forth their liquid flame and deadly balls.\r\nWhile I was engaged in parrying the guns, Brother Joseph said, “That’s\r\nright, Brother Taylor; parry them off as well as you can.” These were\r\nthe last words I ever heard him speak on earth.\r\n\r\nEvery moment the crowd at the door became more dense, as they were\r\nunquestionably pressed on by those in the rear ascending the stairs,\r\nuntil the whole entrance at the door was literally crowded with\r\nmuskets and rifles, which, with the swearing, shouting, and demoniacal\r\nexpressions of those outside the door and on the stairs, and the firing\r\nof guns, mingled with their horrid oaths and execrations, made it look\r\nlike Pandemonium let loose, and was, indeed, a fit representation of\r\nthe horrid deed in which they were engaged.\r\n\r\nAfter parrying the guns for some time, which now protruded thicker\r\nand farther into the room, and seeing no hope of escape or protection\r\nthere, as we were now unarmed, it occurred to me that we might have\r\nsome friends outside, and that there might there be some chance of\r\nescape, but here there seemed to be none. As I expected them every\r\nmoment to rush into the room--nothing but extreme cowardice having thus\r\nfar kept them out--as the tumult and pressure increased, without any\r\nother hope, I made a spring for the window, which was right in front\r\nof the jail door, where the mob was standing, and also exposed to the\r\nfire of the Carthage Grays, who were stationed some ten or twelve rods\r\noff. The weather was hot, we all of us had our coats off, and the\r\nwindow was raised to admit air; as I reached the window, and was on\r\nthe point of leaping out, I was struck by a ball from the door about\r\nmidway of my thigh, which struck the bone, and flattened out almost\r\nto the size of a quarter of a dollar, and then passed on through the\r\nfleshy part to within about half an inch of the outside. I think some\r\nprominent nerve must have been severed or injured, for as soon as the\r\nball struck me I fell like a bird when shot, or an ox struck by a\r\nbutcher, and lost entirely and instantaneously all power of action or\r\nlocomotion. I fell on to the window-sill, and cried out, “I am shot!”\r\nNot possessing any power to move, I felt myself falling outside of the\r\nwindow, but immediately I fell inside, from some, at that time, unknown\r\ncause; when I struck the floor my animation seemed restored, as I have\r\nseen sometimes squirrels and birds after being shot. As soon as I felt\r\nthe power of motion I crawled under the bed, which was in a corner of\r\nthe room, not far from the window where I received my wound. While on\r\nmy way and under the bed I was wounded in three other places; one ball\r\nentered a little below the left knee, and never was extracted; another\r\nentered the forepart of my left arm, a little above the wrist, and,\r\npassing down by the joint, lodged in the fleshy part of my hand, about\r\nmidway, a little above the upper joint of my little finger; another\r\nstruck me on the fleshy part of my left hip, and tore away the flesh\r\nas large as my hand, dashing the mangled fragments of flesh and blood\r\nagainst the wall.\r\n\r\nMy wounds were painful, and the sensation produced was as though a ball\r\nhad passed through and down the whole length of my leg. I very well\r\nremember my reflections at the time. I had a very painful idea of\r\nbecoming lame and decrepit, and being an object of pity, and I felt as\r\nthough I had rather die than be placed in such circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that immediately after my attempt to leap out of the\r\nwindow, Joseph also did the same thing, of which circumstance I have\r\nno knowledge only from information. The first thing that I noticed\r\nwas a cry that he had leaped out of the window. A cessation of firing\r\nfollowed, the mob rushed down stairs, and Dr. Richards went to the\r\nwindow. Immediately afterward I saw the doctor going toward the jail\r\ndoor, and as there was an iron door at the head of the stairs adjoining\r\nour door which led into the cells for criminals, it struck me that the\r\ndoctor was going in there, and I said to him, “Stop, doctor, and take\r\nme along.” He proceeded to the door and opened it, and then returned\r\nand dragged me along to a small cell prepared for criminals.\r\n\r\nBrother Richards was very much troubled, and exclaimed, “Oh! Brother\r\nTaylor, is it possible that they have killed both Brother Hyrum and\r\nJoseph? it can not surely be, and yet I saw them shoot him;” and,\r\nelevating his hands two or three times, he exclaimed, “Oh Lord, my God,\r\nspare thy servants!” He then said, “Brother Taylor, this is a terrible\r\nevent;” and he dragged me farther into the cell, saying, “I am sorry\r\nI can not do better for you;” and, taking an old, filthy mattress, he\r\ncovered me with it, and said, “That may hide you, and you may yet live\r\nto tell the tale, but I expect they will kill me in a few moments.”\r\nWhile lying in this position I suffered the most excruciating pain.\r\n\r\nSoon afterward Dr. Richards came to me, informing me that the mob had\r\nprecipitately fled, and at the same time confirming my worst fears that\r\nJoseph was assuredly dead. I felt a dull, lonely, sickening sensation\r\nat the news. When I reflected that our noble chieftain, the prophet of\r\nthe living God, had fallen, and that I had seen his brother in the cold\r\nembrace of death, it seemed as though there was an open void or vacuum\r\nin the great field of human existence to me, and a dark, gloomy chasm\r\nin the kingdom, and that we were left alone. Oh, how lonely was that\r\nfeeling! how cold, barren, and desolate! In the midst of difficulties\r\nhe was always the first in motion; in critical position his counsel\r\nwas always sought. As our prophet he approached our God, and obtained\r\nfor us his will; but now our prophet, our counselor, our general, our\r\nleader was gone, and, amid the fiery ordeal that we then had to pass\r\nthrough, we were left alone without his aid, and as our future guide\r\nfor things spiritual or temporal, and for all things pertaining to this\r\nworld or the next, he had spoken for the last time on earth.\r\n\r\nThese reflections and a thousand others flashed upon my mind. I\r\nthought, Why must the good perish, and the virtuous be destroyed?\r\nWhy must God’s nobility, the salt of the earth, the most exalted of\r\nthe human family, and the most perfect types of all excellence, fall\r\nvictims to the cruel, fiendish hate of incarnate devils?\r\n\r\nThe poignancy of my grief, I presume, however, was somewhat allayed by\r\nthe extreme suffering that I endured from my wounds.\r\n\r\nSoon afterward I was taken to the head of the stairs and laid there,\r\nwhere I had a full view of our beloved and now murdered brother Hyrum.\r\nThere he lay as I had left him; he had not moved a limb; he lay placid\r\nand calm, a monument of greatness even in death; but his noble spirit\r\nhad left its tenement, and was gone to dwell in regions more congenial\r\nto its exalted nature. Poor Hyrum! he was a great and a good man, and\r\nmy soul was cemented to his. If ever there was an exemplary, honest,\r\nand virtuous man, an embodiment of all that is noble in the human form,\r\nHyrum Smith was its representative.\r\n\r\nWhile I lay there a number of persons came around, among whom was a\r\nphysician. The doctor, on seeing a ball lodged in my left hand, took\r\na penknife from his pocket and made an incision in it for the purpose\r\nof extracting the ball therefrom, and having obtained a pair of\r\ncarpenter’s compasses, made use of them to draw or pry out the ball,\r\nalternately using the penknife and compasses. After sawing for some\r\ntime with a dull penknife, and prying and pulling with the compasses,\r\nhe ultimately succeeded in extracting the ball, which was about a half\r\nounce one. Some time afterward he remarked to a friend of mine that “I\r\nhad nerves like the devil to stand what I did in its extraction.” I\r\nreally thought I had need of nerves to stand such surgical butchery,\r\nand that, whatever my nerves may be, his practice was devilish.\r\n\r\nThis company wished to remove me to Mr. Hamilton’s hotel, the place\r\nwhere we had staid previous to our incarceration in jail. I told them,\r\nhowever, that I did not wish to go; I did not consider it safe. They\r\nprotested that it was, and that I was safe with them; that it was a\r\nperfect outrage for men to be used as we had been; that they were my\r\nfriends; that it was for my good they were counseling me, and that I\r\ncould be better taken care of there than here.\r\n\r\nI replied, “I don’t know you. Who am I among? I am surrounded by\r\nassassins and murderers; witness your deeds! Don’t talk to me of\r\nkindness or comfort; look at your murdered victims. Look at me! I want\r\nnone of your counsel nor comfort. There may be some safety here; I can\r\nbe assured of none any where,” etc.\r\n\r\nThey “God damned their souls to hell,” made the most solemn\r\nasseverations, and swore by God and the devil, and every thing else\r\nthat they could think of, that they would stand by me to death and\r\nprotect me. In half an hour every one of them had fled to the town.\r\n\r\nSoon after a coroner’s jury were assembled in the room over the body\r\nof Hyrum. Among the jurors was Captain Smith, of the “Carthage Grays,”\r\nwho had assisted in the murder, and the same justice before whom we\r\nhad been tried. I heard the name of Francis Higbee as being in the\r\nneighborhood; on hearing his name mentioned, I immediately rose and\r\nsaid, “Captain Smith, you are a justice of the peace; I have heard his\r\nname mentioned; I want to swear my life against him.” I was informed\r\nthat word was immediately sent to him to leave the place, which he did.\r\n\r\nBrother Richards was busy during this time attending to the coroner’s\r\ninquest, and to the removal of the bodies, and making arrangements for\r\ntheir removal from Carthage to Nauvoo.\r\n\r\nWhen we had a little leisure, he again came to me, and at his\r\nsuggestion I was removed to Hamilton’s tavern; I felt that he was the\r\nonly friend, the only person, that I could rely upon in that town. It\r\nwas with difficulty that sufficient persons could be found to carry\r\nme to the tavern; for immediately after the murder a great fear fell\r\nupon all the people, and men, women, and children fled with great\r\nprecipitation, leaving nothing nor any body in the town but two or\r\nthree women and children, and one or two sick persons.\r\n\r\nIt was with great difficulty that Brother Richards prevailed upon\r\nMr. Hamilton, hotel-keeper, and his family, to stay; they would not\r\nuntil Brother Richards had given a solemn promise that he would see\r\nthem protected, and hence I was looked upon as a hostage. Under these\r\ncircumstances, notwithstanding, I believe they were hostile to the\r\n“Mormons,” and were glad that the murder had taken place, yet they\r\ndid not actually participate in it; and, feeling that I should be a\r\nprotection to them, they staid.\r\n\r\nThe whole community knew that a dreadful outrage had been perpetrated\r\nby those villains, and fearing lest the citizens of Nauvoo, as they\r\npossessed the power, might have a disposition to visit them with a\r\nterrible vengeance, they fled in the wildest confusion. And, indeed,\r\nit was with very great difficulty that the citizens of Nauvoo could\r\nbe restrained; a horrid, barbarous murder had been committed, the\r\nmost solemn pledge violated, and that, too, while the victims were,\r\ncontrary to the requirements of the law, putting themselves into the\r\nhands of the governor to pacify a popular excitement. This outrage\r\nwas enhanced by the reflection that we were able to protect ourselves\r\nagainst not only all the mob, but against three times their number and\r\nthat of the governor’s troops put together. These were exasperated\r\nby the speech of the governor in town. The whole events were so\r\nfaithless, so dastardly, so mean, cowardly, and contemptible, without\r\none extenuating circumstance, that it would not have been surprising\r\nif the citizens of Nauvoo had arisen _en masse_, and blotted the\r\nwretches out of existence. The citizens of Carthage knew they would\r\nhave done so under such circumstances, and, judging us by themselves,\r\nthey were all panic-stricken and fled. Colonel Markham, too, after his\r\nexpulsion from Carthage, had gone home, related the circumstances of\r\nhis ejectment, and was using his influence to get a company to go out.\r\nFearing that when the people heard that their prophet and patriarch\r\nhad been murdered under the above circumstances they might act rashly,\r\nand knowing that, if they once got roused, like a mighty avalanche\r\nthey would lay the country waste before them and take a terrible\r\nvengeance--as none of the twelve were in Nauvoo, and no one, perhaps,\r\nwith sufficient influence to control the people, Dr. Richards, after\r\nconsulting me, wrote the following note, fearing that my family might\r\nbe seriously affected by the news. I told him to insert that I was\r\nslightly wounded.\r\n\r\n_William Richards’s Note from Carthage Jail to Nauvoo._[243]\r\n\r\n  “Carthage Jail, 8 o’clock 5 min. P.M., June 27th, 1844.\r\n\r\n  “Joseph and Hyrum are dead. Taylor wounded, not very badly. I am\r\n  well. Our guard was forced, as we believe, by a band of Missourians\r\n  from 100 to 200. The job was done in an instant, and the party fled\r\n  toward Nauvoo instantly. This is as I believe it. The citizens here\r\n  are afraid of the Mormons attacking them; I promise them no.\r\n\r\n  W. RICHARDS.\r\n\r\n  “N.B.--The citizens promise us protection; alarm guns have been fired.\r\n\r\n  “JOHN TAYLOR.”\r\n\r\n  [243] “Des. News,” No. 38, Nov. 25, 1857, p. 297.\r\n\r\nI remember signing my name as quickly as possible, lest the tremor of\r\nmy hand should be noticed, and their fears too excited.\r\n\r\nA messenger was dispatched immediately with that note, but he was\r\nintercepted by the governor, who, on hearing a cannon fired at\r\nCarthage, which was to be the signal for the murder, immediately\r\nfled with his company, and fearing that the citizens of Nauvoo, when\r\napprised of the horrible outrage, would immediately rise and pursue, he\r\nturned back the messenger, who was George D. Grant. A second one was\r\nsent, who was treated similarly; and not until a third attempt could\r\nnews be got to Nauvoo.\r\n\r\nSamuel H. Smith, brother to Joseph and Hyrum, was the first brother\r\nthat I saw after the outrage; I am not sure whether he took the news\r\nor not; he lived at the time at Plymouth, Hancock County, and was on\r\nhis way to Carthage to see his brothers, when he was met by some of the\r\ntroops, or rather mob, that had been dismissed by the governor, and who\r\nwere on their way home. On learning that he was Joseph Smith’s brother\r\nthey sought to kill him, but he escaped, and fled into the woods, where\r\nhe was chased for a length of time by them; but, after severe fatigue,\r\nand much danger and excitement, he succeeded in escaping, and came\r\nto Carthage. He was on horseback when he arrived, and was not only\r\nvery much tired with the fatigue and excitement of the chase, but was\r\nalso very much distressed in feelings on account of the death of his\r\nbrother. These things produced a fever, which laid the foundation for\r\nhis death, which took place on the 30th of July. Thus another of the\r\nbrothers fell a victim, although not directly, but indirectly to this\r\ninfernal mob.\r\n\r\nI lay from about five o’clock until two next morning without having my\r\nwounds dressed, as there was scarcely any help of any kind in Carthage,\r\nand Brother Richards was busy with the dead bodies, preparing them for\r\nremoval. My wife Leonora started early the next day, having had some\r\nlittle trouble in getting a company or a physician to come with her;\r\nafter considerable difficulty she succeeded in getting an escort, and\r\nDr. Samuel Bennet came along with her. Soon after my father and mother\r\narrived from Quakie, near which place they had a farm at that time, and\r\nhearing of the trouble, hastened along.\r\n\r\nGeneral Demming, Brigadier General of the Hancock County Militia, was\r\nvery much of a gentleman, and showed me every courtesy, and Colonel\r\nJones also was very solicitous about my welfare.\r\n\r\nI was called upon by several gentlemen of Quincy and other places,\r\namong whom was Judge Ralston, as well as by our own people, and a\r\nmedical man extracted a ball from my left thigh that was giving me much\r\npain: it lay about half an inch deep, and my thigh was considerably\r\nswollen. The doctor asked me if I would be tied during the operation;\r\nI told him no; that I could endure the cutting associated with the\r\noperation as well without, and I did so; indeed, so great was the pain\r\nI endured that the cutting was rather a relief than otherwise.\r\n\r\nA very laughable incident occurred at the time: my wife Leonora went\r\ninto an adjoining room to pray for me, that I might be sustained during\r\nthe operation. While on her knees at prayer, a Mrs. Bedell, an old lady\r\nof the Methodist association, entered, and, patting Mrs. Taylor on her\r\nback with her hand, said, “There’s a good lady, pray for God to forgive\r\nyour sins; pray that you may be converted, and the Lord may have mercy\r\non your soul.”\r\n\r\nThe scene was so ludicrous that Mrs. Taylor knew not whether to laugh\r\nor be angry. Mrs. Taylor informed me that Mr. Hamilton, the father of\r\nthe Hamilton who kept the house, rejoiced at the murder, and said in\r\ncompany “that it was done up in the best possible style, and showed\r\ngood generalship;” and she farther believed that the other branches of\r\nthe family sanctioned it. These were the associates of the old lady\r\nreferred to, and yet she could talk of conversion and saving souls in\r\nthe midst of blood and murder: such is man and such consistency.\r\n\r\nThe ball being extracted was the one that first struck me, which I\r\nbefore referred to; it entered on the outside of my left thigh, about\r\nfive inches from my knee, and, passing rather obliquely toward my body,\r\nhad, it would seem, struck the bone, for it was flattened out nearly as\r\nthin and large as a quarter of a dollar.\r\n\r\nThe governor passed on, staying at Carthage only a few minutes, and\r\nhe did not stop until he got fifty miles from Nauvoo. There had been\r\nvarious opinions about the complicity of the governor in the murder,\r\nsome supposing that he knew all about it, and assisted or winked at its\r\nexecution. It is somewhat difficult to form a correct opinion; from\r\nthe facts presented it is very certain that things looked more than\r\nsuspicious against him.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, he positively knew that we had broken no law.\r\n\r\nSecondly. He knew that the mob had not only passed inflammatory\r\nresolutions, threatening extermination to the “Mormons,” but that they\r\nhad actually assembled armed mobs and commenced hostilities against us.\r\n\r\nThirdly. He took those very mobs that had been arrayed against us, and\r\nenrolled them as his troops, thus legalizing their acts.\r\n\r\nFourthly. He disbanded the Nauvoo Legion, which had never violated law,\r\nand disarmed them, and had about his person in the shape of militia\r\nknown mobocrats and violators of the law.\r\n\r\nFifthly. He requested us to come to Carthage without arms, promising\r\nprotection, and then refused to interfere in delivering us from prison,\r\nalthough Joseph and Hyrum were put there contrary to law.\r\n\r\nSixthly. Although he refused to interfere in our behalf, yet, when\r\nCaptain Smith went to him and informed him that the persons refused to\r\ncome out, he told him that “he had a command and knew what to do,” thus\r\nsanctioning the use of force in the violation of law when opposed to\r\nus, whereas he would not for us interpose his executive authority to\r\nfree us from being incarcerated contrary to law, although he was fully\r\ninformed of all the facts of the case, as we kept him posted in the\r\naffairs all the time.\r\n\r\nSeventhly. He left the prisoners in Carthage jail contrary to his\r\nplighted faith.\r\n\r\nEighthly. Before he went he dismissed all the troops that could be\r\nrelied upon, as well as many of the mob, and left us in charge of the\r\n“Carthage Grays,” a company that he knew were mobocratic, our most\r\nbitter enemies, and who had passed resolutions to exterminate us, and\r\nwho had been placed under guard by General Demming only the day before.\r\n\r\nNinthly. He was informed of the intended murder, both before he left\r\nand while on the road, by several different parties.\r\n\r\nTenthly. When the cannon was fired in Carthage, signifying that the\r\ndeed was done, he immediately took up his line of march and fled. How\r\ndid he know that this signal portended their death if he was not in the\r\nsecret? It may be said some of the party told him. How could he believe\r\nwhat the party said about the gun-signal if he could not believe the\r\ntestimony of several individuals who told him in positive terms about\r\nthe contemplated murder?\r\n\r\nHe has, I believe, stated that he left the “Carthage Grays” there\r\nbecause he considered that, as their town was contiguous to ours, and\r\nas the responsibility of our safety rested solely upon them, they would\r\nnot dare suffer any indignity to befall us. This very admission shows\r\nthat he did really expect danger; and then he knew that these people\r\nhad published to the world that they would exterminate us, and his\r\nleaving us in their hands and talking of their responsibilities was\r\nlike leaving a lamb in charge of a wolf, and trusting to its humanity\r\nand honor for its safe-keeping.\r\n\r\nIt is said, again, that he would not have gone to Nauvoo, and thus\r\nplaced himself in the hands of the “Mormons,” if he had anticipated any\r\nsuch event, as he would be exposed to their wrath. To this it may be\r\nanswered that the “Mormons” did not know their signals, while he did;\r\nand they were also known in Warsaw, as well as in other places; and as\r\nsoon as the gun was fired, a merchant of Warsaw jumped upon his horse\r\nand rode directly to Quincy, and reported “Joseph and Hyrum killed, and\r\nthose who were with them in jail.” He reported farther “that they were\r\nattempting to break jail, and were all killed by the guard.” This was\r\ntheir story; it was anticipated to kill all, and the gun was to be the\r\nsignal that the deed was accomplished. This was known in Warsaw. The\r\ngovernor also knew it and fled; and he could really be in no danger in\r\nNauvoo, for the Mormons did not know it, and he had plenty of time to\r\nescape, which he did.\r\n\r\nIt is said that he made all his officers promise solemnly that they\r\nwould help him to protect the Smiths; this may or may not be. At any\r\nrate, some of these same officers helped to murder them.\r\n\r\nThe strongest argument in the governor’s favor, and one that would bear\r\nmore weight with us than all the rest put together, would be that he\r\ncould not believe them capable of such atrocity; and, thinking that\r\ntheir talk and threatenings were a mere ebullition of feeling, a kind\r\nof braggadocio, and that there was enough of good moral feeling to\r\ncontrol the more violent passions, he trusted to their faith. There\r\nis, indeed, a degree of plausibility about this, but when we put it in\r\njuxtaposition to the amount of evidence that he was in possession of\r\nit weighs very little. He had nothing to inspire confidence in them,\r\nand every thing to make him mistrust them. Besides, why his broken\r\nfaith? why his disregard of what was told him by several parties?\r\nAgain, if he knew not the plan, how did he understand the signal? Why\r\nso oblivious to every thing pertaining to the “Mormon” interest, and so\r\nalive and interested about the mobocrats? At any rate, be this as it\r\nmay, he stands responsible for their blood, and it is dripping on his\r\ngarments. If it had not been for his promises of protection, they would\r\nhave protected themselves; it was plighted faith that led them to the\r\nslaughter; and, to make the best of it, it was a breach of that faith\r\nand a non-fulfillment of that promise, after repeated warnings, that\r\nled to their death.\r\n\r\nHaving said so much, I must leave the governor with my readers and\r\nwith his God. Justice, I conceive, demanded this much, and truth could\r\nnot be told with less; as I have said before, my opinion is that the\r\ngovernor would not have planned this murder, but he had not sufficient\r\nenergy to resist popular opinion, even if that opinion led to blood and\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nIt was rumored that a strong political party, numbering in its ranks\r\nmany of the prominent men of the nation, were engaged in a plot for the\r\noverthrow of Joseph Smith, and that the governor was of this party,\r\nand Sharp, Williams, Captain Smith, and others, were his accomplices,\r\nbut whether this was the case or not I don’t know. It is very certain\r\nthat a strong political feeling existed against Joseph Smith, and I\r\nhave reason to believe that his letters to Henry Clay were made use of\r\nby political parties opposed to Mr. Clay, and were the means of that\r\nstatesman’s defeat. Yet, if such a combination as the one referred to\r\nexisted, I am not apprised of it.\r\n\r\nWhile I lay at Carthage, previous to Mrs. Taylor’s arrival, a pretty\r\ngood sort of a man, who was lame of a leg, waited upon me, and sat up\r\nat night with me; after Mrs. Taylor, my mother and others waited upon\r\nme.\r\n\r\nMany friends called upon me, among whom were Richard Ballantyne,\r\nElizabeth Taylor, several of the Perkins family, and a number of the\r\nbrethren from Macedonia and La Harpe. Besides these, many strangers\r\nfrom Quincy, some of whom expressed indignant feelings against the\r\nmob and sympathy for myself. Brother Alexander Williams called upon\r\nme, who suspected that they had some designs in keeping me there, and\r\nstated “that he had at a given point in some woods fifty men, and that\r\nif I would say the word he would raise other fifty, and fetch me out\r\nof there.” I thanked him, but told him I thought there was no need.\r\nHowever, it would seem that I was in some danger; for Colonel Jones,\r\nbefore referred to, when absent from me, left two loaded pistols on\r\nthe table in case of an attack, and some time afterward, when I had\r\nrecovered and was publishing the affair, a lawyer, Mr. Backman, stated\r\nthat he had prevented a man by the name of Jackson, before referred to,\r\nfrom ascending the stairs, who was coming with a design to murder me,\r\nand that now he was sorry he had not let him do the deed.\r\n\r\nThere were others, also, of whom I heard that said I ought to be\r\nkilled, and they would do it, but that it was too damned cowardly to\r\nshoot a wounded man; and thus, by the chivalry of murderers, I was\r\nprevented from being a second time mutilated or killed. Many of the\r\nmob, too, came around and treated me with apparent respect, and the\r\nofficers and people generally looked upon me as a hostage, and feared\r\nthat my removal would be the signal for the rising of the Mormons.\r\n\r\nI do not remember the time that I staid there, but I think three\r\nor four days after the murder, when Brother Marks with a carriage,\r\nBrother James Aldred with a wagon, Dr. Ells, and a number of others on\r\nhorseback, came for the purpose of taking me to Nauvoo. I was very weak\r\nat the time, occasioned by the loss of blood and the great discharge\r\nof my wounds, so that when Mrs. Taylor asked me if I could talk I\r\ncould barely whisper no. Quite a discussion arose as to the propriety\r\nof my removal, the physicians and people of Carthage protesting that\r\nit would be my death, while my friends were anxious for my removal if\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nI suppose the former were actuated by the above-named desire to keep\r\nme. Colonel Jones was, I believe, sincere; he has acted as a friend\r\nall the time, and he told Mrs. Taylor she ought to persuade me not to\r\ngo, for he did not believe I had strength enough to reach Nauvoo. It\r\nwas finally agreed, however, that I should go; but as it was thought\r\nthat I could not stand riding in a wagon or carriage, they prepared a\r\nlitter for me; I was carried down stairs and put upon it. A number of\r\nmen assisted to carry me, some of whom had been engaged in the mob. As\r\nsoon as I got down stairs, I felt much better and strengthened, so that\r\nI could talk; I suppose the effect of the fresh air.\r\n\r\nWhen we had got near the outside of the town I remembered some woods\r\nthat we had to go through, and telling a person near to call for Dr.\r\nElls, who was riding a very good horse, I said, “Doctor, I perceive\r\nthat the people are getting fatigued with carrying me; a number of\r\nMormons live about two or three miles from here, near our route; will\r\nyou ride to their settlement as quietly as possible, and have them come\r\nand meet us?” He started off on a gallop immediately. My object in this\r\nwas to obtain protection in case of an attack, rather than to obtain\r\nhelp to carry me.\r\n\r\nVery soon after the men from Carthage made one excuse after another,\r\nuntil they had all left, and I felt glad to get rid of them. I found\r\nthat the tramping of those carrying me produced violent pain, and a\r\nsleigh was produced and attached to the hind end of Brother James\r\nAldred’s wagon, a bed placed upon it, and I propped up on the bed. Mrs.\r\nTaylor rode with me, applying ice and ice-water to my wounds. As the\r\nsleigh was dragged over the grass on the prairie, which was quite tall,\r\nit moved very easily and gave me very little pain.\r\n\r\nWhen I got within five or six miles of Nauvoo the brethren commenced to\r\nmeet me from the city, and they increased in number as we drew nearer,\r\nuntil there was a very large company of people of all ages and both\r\nsexes, principally, however, men.\r\n\r\nFor some time there had been almost incessant rain, so that in many\r\nlow places in the prairie it was from one to three feet deep in water,\r\nand at such places the brethren whom we met took hold of the sleigh,\r\nlifted it, and carried it over the water; and when we arrived in the\r\nneighborhood of the city, where the roads were excessively muddy and\r\nbad, the brethren tore down the fences, and we passed through the\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nNever shall I forget the difference of feeling that I experienced\r\nbetween the place that I had left and the one that I had now arrived\r\nat. I had left a lot of reckless, bloodthirsty murderers, and had\r\ncome to the City of the Saints, the people of the living God; friends\r\nof truth and righteousness, thousands of whom stood there with warm,\r\ntrue hearts to offer their friendship and services, and to welcome\r\nmy return. It is true it was a painful scene, and brought sorrowful\r\nremembrances to mind, but to me it caused a thrill of joy to find\r\nmyself once more in the bosom of my friends, and to meet with the\r\ncordial welcome of true, honest hearts. What was very remarkable, I\r\nfound myself very much better after my arrival at Nauvoo than I was\r\nwhen I started on my journey, although I had traveled eighteen miles.\r\n\r\nThe next day, as some change was wanting, I told Mrs. Taylor that if\r\nshe could send to Dr. Richards, he had my purse and watch, and they\r\nwould find money in my purse.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the doctor leaving Carthage, I told him that he had better\r\ntake my purse and watch, for I was afraid the people would steal them.\r\nThe doctor had taken my pantaloons’ pocket, and put the watch in it\r\nwith the purse, cut off the pocket, and tied a string round the top; it\r\nwas in this position when brought home. My family, however, were not a\r\nlittle startled to find that my watch had been struck with a ball. I\r\nsent for my vest, and, upon examination, it was found that there was\r\na cut, as if with a knife, in the vest pocket which had contained my\r\nwatch. In the pocket the fragments of the glass were found literally\r\nground to powder. It then occurred to me that a ball had struck me at\r\nthe time I felt myself falling out of the window, and that it was this\r\nforce that threw me inside. I had often remarked to Mrs. Taylor the\r\nsingular fact of finding myself inside the room, when I felt a moment\r\nbefore, after being shot, that I was falling out, and I never could\r\naccount for it until then; but here the thing was fully elucidated,\r\nand was rendered plain to my mind. I was indeed falling out, when some\r\nvillain aimed at my heart. The ball struck my watch, and forced me\r\nback; if I had fallen out I should assuredly have been killed, if not\r\nby the fall, by those around, and this ball, intended to dispatch me,\r\nwas turned by an overruling Providence into a messenger of mercy, and\r\nsaved my life. I shall never forget the feelings of gratitude that I\r\nthen experienced toward my heavenly Father; the whole scene was vividly\r\nportrayed before me, and my heart melted before the Lord. I felt that\r\nthe Lord had preserved me by a special act of mercy; that my time had\r\nnot yet come, and that I had still a work to perform upon the earth.\r\n\r\n  (Signed), JOHN TAYLOR.\r\n\r\nNOTES.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above I give the following:\r\n\r\nDr. Bernhisel informed me that Joseph, looking him full in the\r\nface, and as solemn as eternity, said, “I am going as a lamb to the\r\nslaughter, but I am as calm as a summer’s morning. I have a conscience\r\nvoid of offense toward God and man.” I heard him state, in reply to\r\nan interrogatory, made either by myself or some one in my hearing, in\r\nrelation to the best course to pursue, “I am not now acting according\r\nto my judgment; others must counsel, and not me, for the present,” or\r\nin words to the same effect.\r\n\r\nThe governor’s remarks about the press may be partially correct, so far\r\nas the legal technicality was concerned, and the order of administering\r\nlaw. The proper way would perhaps have been for the City Council to\r\nhave passed a law in regard to the removal of nuisances, and then for\r\nthe Municipal Court to have ordered it to be abated on complaint. Be\r\nthis as it may, it was only a variation in form, not in fact, for the\r\nMunicipal Court formed part of the City Council, and all voted; and,\r\nfurthermore, some time after the murder, Governor Ford told me that the\r\npress ought to have been removed, but that it was bad policy to remove\r\nit as we did; that if we had only let a mob do it, instead of using\r\nthe law, we could have done it without difficulty, and no one would\r\nhave been implicated. Thus the governor, who would have winked at the\r\nproceedings of a mob, lent his aid to, or winked at, the proceedings\r\nof mob violence in the assassination of Joseph and Hyrum Smith, for\r\nremoving a nuisance according to law, because of an alleged informality\r\nin the legal proceedings or a legal technicality.\r\n\r\nI must here state that I do not believe Governor Ford would have\r\nplanned the murder of Joseph and Hyrum Smith; but, being a man that\r\ncourted popular opinion, he had not the firmness to withstand the mob,\r\neven when that mob were seeking to imbrue their hands in the blood of\r\ninnocence; he lent himself to their designs, and thus became a partaker\r\nof their evil deeds.\r\n\r\nI will illustrate this vexed question with the following official\r\npaper, which appeared in the “Deserét News,” No. 30:\r\n\r\n“Two of the brethren arrived this evening (June 13th, 1844), from\r\nCarthage, and said that about 300 mobbers were assembled there, with\r\nthe avowed intention of coming against Nauvoo. Also that Hamilton was\r\npaying a dollar per bushel for corn to feed their animals.”\r\n\r\nThe following was published in the Warsaw Signal Office; I insert it as\r\na specimen of the unparalleled corruption and diabolical falsehood of\r\nwhich the human race has become capable in this generation:\r\n\r\n“At a mass meeting of the citizens of Hancock County, convened at\r\nCarthage on the 11th day of June, 1844, Mr. Knox was appointed\r\nPresident, John Doty and Lewis F. Evans, Vice-Presidents, and William\r\nY. Head, Secretary.\r\n\r\n“Henry Stephens, Esq., presented the following resolutions, passed at\r\na meeting of the citizens of Warsaw, and urged the adoption of them as\r\nthe sense of this meeting:\r\n\r\n“PREAMBLE AND RESOLUTIONS.\r\n\r\n“Whereas information has reached us, about which there can be no\r\nquestion, that the authorities of Nauvoo did recently pass an ordinance\r\ndeclaring a printing-press and newspaper published by the opponents\r\nof the Prophet a nuisance, and in pursuance thereof did direct the\r\nmarshal of the city and his adherents to enter by force the building\r\nfrom whence the paper was issued, and violently (if necessary) to take\r\npossession of the press and printing materials, and thereafter to burn\r\nand destroy the same; and whereas, in pursuance of said ordinance, the\r\nmarshal and his adherents, together with a mob of Mormons, did, after\r\nsunset on the evening of the 10th inst., violently enter said building\r\nin a tumultuous manner, burn and destroy the press and other materials\r\nfound on the premises;\r\n\r\n“And whereas Hyrum Smith did, in presence of the City Council and\r\nthe citizens of Nauvoo, offer a reward for the destruction of the\r\nprinting-press and materials of the ‘Warsaw Signal,’ a newspaper also\r\nopposed to his interest;\r\n\r\n“And whereas the liberty of the press is one of the cardinal principles\r\nof our government, firmly guaranteed by the several Constitutions of\r\nthe states as well as the United States;\r\n\r\n“And whereas Hyrum Smith has within the last week publicly threatened\r\nthe life of one of our valued citizens, Thos. C. Sharp, the editor of\r\nthe ‘Signal:’\r\n\r\n“Therefore be it solemnly _Resolved_ by the citizens of Warsaw in\r\npublic meeting assembled,\r\n\r\n“That we view the recent ordinance of the city of Nauvoo, and the\r\nproceedings thereunder, as an outrage of an alarming character,\r\nrevolutionary and tyrannical in its tendency, and, being under color of\r\nlaw, as calculated to subvert and destroy in the minds of the community\r\nall reliance on the law.\r\n\r\n“_Resolved_, That as a community we feel anxious, when possible, to\r\nredress our grievances by legal remedies; but the time has now arrived\r\nwhen the law has ceased to be a protection to our lives and property;\r\na mob at Nauvoo, under a city ordinance, has violated the highest\r\nprivilege in our government, and to seek redress in the ordinary mode\r\nwould be utterly ineffectual.\r\n\r\n“_Resolved_, That the public threat made in the council of the city not\r\nonly to destroy our printing-press, but to take the life of its editor,\r\nis sufficient, in connection with the recent outrage, to command the\r\nefforts and the services of every good citizen to put an immediate stop\r\nto the career of the mad Prophet and his demoniac coadjutors. We must\r\nnot only defend ourselves from danger, but we must resolutely carry\r\nthe war into the enemy’s camp. We do therefore declare that we will\r\nsustain our press and the editor at all hazards. That we will take full\r\nvengeance--terrible vengeance, should the lives of any of our citizens\r\nbe lost in the effort. That we hold ourselves at all times in readiness\r\nto co-operate with our fellow-citizens in this state, Missouri, and\r\nIowa, _to exterminate_--UTTERLY EXTERMINATE, the wicked and abominable\r\nMormon leaders, the authors of our troubles.\r\n\r\n“_Resolved_, That a committee of five be appointed forthwith to notify\r\nall persons in our township _suspected_ of being the tools of the\r\nProphet to leave immediately on pain of INSTANT VENGEANCE. And we do\r\nrecommend the inhabitants of the adjacent townships to do the same,\r\nhereby pledging ourselves to render all the assistance they may require.\r\n\r\n“_Resolved_, That the time, in our opinion, has arrived when the\r\nadherents of Smith, as a body, should be driven from the surrounding\r\nsettlements into Nauvoo; that the Prophet and his miscreant adherents\r\nshould then be demanded at their hands, and if not surrendered, A\r\nWAR OF EXTERMINATION SHOULD BE WAGED, to the entire destruction, if\r\nnecessary for our protection, of his adherents. And we do hereby\r\nrecommend this resolution to the consideration of the several\r\ntownships, to the Mass Convention to be held at Carthage, hereby\r\npledging ourselves to aid to the utmost the complete consummation of\r\nthe object in view, that we may thereby be utterly relieved of the\r\nalarm, anxiety, and trouble to which we are now subjected.\r\n\r\n“_Resolved_, That every citizen arm himself, to be prepared to sustain\r\nthe resolutions herein contained.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Roosevelt rose and made a brief but eloquent speech, and called\r\nupon the citizens throughout the country to render efficient aid\r\nin carrying out the spirit of the resolutions. Mr. Roosevelt then\r\nmoved that a committee of seven be appointed by the chair to draft\r\nresolutions expressive of our action in future.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Catlin moved to amend the motion of Mr. Roosevelt so that the\r\ncommittee should consist of one from each precinct; which motion, as\r\namended, was adopted.\r\n\r\n“The chair then appointed the following as said committee: Colonel Levi\r\nWilliams, Rocky Run Precinct; Joel Catlin, Augusta; Samuel Williams,\r\nCarthage; Elisha Worrell, Chili; Captain Maddison, St. Mary’s; John\r\nM. Ferris, Fountain Green; James Rice, Pilot Grove; John Carns, Bear\r\nCreek; C. L. Higbee, Nauvoo; George Robinson, La Harpe; and George\r\nRockwell, Warsaw.\r\n\r\n“On motion of Mr. Sympson, Walter Bagby, Esq., was requested to\r\naddress the meeting during the absence of the committee. He spoke long\r\nand eloquently upon the cause of our grievances, and expressed his\r\nbelief that the time was now at hand when we were individually and\r\ncollectively called upon to repel the innovations upon our liberties,\r\nand suggested that points be designated as places of encampment at\r\nwhich to rendezvous our forces, that we may be ready, when called upon,\r\nfor efficient action.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Barns, one of the persons who went with the officers to Nauvoo\r\nfor the purpose of arresting the rioters, having just arrived, came\r\ninto the meeting, and reported the result of their proceedings, which\r\nwas, that the persons charged in the writs were duly arrested, but\r\ntaken from the officer’s hands on a writ of _habeas corpus_ from the\r\nMunicipal Court, and discharged, and the following potent words entered\r\nupon the records--HONORABLY DISCHARGED.\r\n\r\n“On motion of O. C. Skinner, Esq., a vote of thanks was tendered to Dr.\r\nBarns for volunteering his services in executing said writs.\r\n\r\n“Francis M. Higbee was now loudly called for. He stated his personal\r\nknowledge of the Mormons from their earliest history, throughout their\r\nhellish career in Missouri and this state, which had been characterized\r\nby the darkest and most diabolical deeds which had ever disgraced\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\n“The committee appointed to draft resolutions brought in the following\r\nreport, which, after some considerable discussion, was unanimously\r\nadopted:\r\n\r\n“‘Whereas the officer charged with the execution of a writ against\r\nJoseph Smith and others, for riot in the County of Hancock, which said\r\nwrit said officer has served upon said Smith and others; and whereas\r\nsaid Smith and others refuse to obey the mandate of said writ; and\r\nwhereas, in the opinion of this meeting, it is impossible for the said\r\nofficer to raise a posse of sufficient strength to execute said writ;\r\nand whereas it is the opinion of this meeting that the riot is still\r\nprogressing, and that violence is meditated and determined on, it is\r\nthe opinion of this meeting that the circumstances of the case require\r\nthe interposition of executive power: Therefore,\r\n\r\n“‘_Resolved_, That a deputation of two discreet men be sent to\r\nSpringfield to solicit such interposition.\r\n\r\n“‘2d. _Resolved_, That said deputation be furnished with a certified\r\ncopy of the resolution, and be authorized to obtain evidence by\r\naffidavit and otherwise in regard to the violence which has already\r\nbeen committed and is still farther meditated.’\r\n\r\n“Dr. Evans here rose and expressed his wish that the above resolutions\r\nwould not retard our operations, but that we would each one arm and\r\nequip ourselves forthwith.\r\n\r\n“The resolutions passed at Warsaw were again read by Dr. Barns, and\r\npassed by acclamation.\r\n\r\n“On motion of A. Sympson, Esq., the suggestion of Mr. Bagby, appointing\r\nplaces of encampment, was adopted, to wit: Warsaw, Carthage, Green\r\nPlains, Spilman’s Landing, Chili, and La Harpe.\r\n\r\n“On motion, O. C. Skinner and Walter Bagby, Esqrs., were appointed\r\na committee to bear the resolutions adopted by this meeting to his\r\nexcellency the governor, requiring his executive interposition.\r\n\r\n“On motion of J.

HEAD, Secretary.”\r\n\r\nThe following will conclude the “Expositor Question:”\r\n\r\n  “Nauvoo, June 14th, 1844.\r\n\r\n  “SIR,--I write you this morning briefly to inform you of the facts\r\n  relative to the removal of the press and fixtures of the ‘Nauvoo\r\n  Expositor’ as a nuisance.\r\n\r\n  “The 8th and 10th instant were spent by the City Council of Nauvoo in\r\n  receiving testimony concerning the character of the ‘Expositor,’ and\r\n  the character and designs of the proprietors.\r\n\r\n  “In the investigation it appeared evident to the Council that\r\n  the proprietors were a set of unprincipled, lawless debauchees,\r\n  counterfeiters, bogus-makers, gamblers, peace-disturbers, and\r\n  that the grand object of said proprietors was to destroy our\r\n  constitutional rights and chartered privileges; to overthrow all\r\n  good and wholesome regulations in society; to strengthen themselves\r\n  against the municipality; to fortify themselves against the Church\r\n  of which I am a member, and destroy all our religious rights and\r\n  privileges by libels, slanders, falsehoods, perjury, etc., and\r\n  sticking at no corruption to accomplish their hellish purposes; and\r\n  that said paper of itself was libelous of the deepest dye, and very\r\n  injurious as a vehicle of defamation, tending to corrupt the morals,\r\n  and disturb the peace, tranquillity, and happiness of the whole\r\n  community, and especially that of Nauvoo.\r\n\r\n  “After a long and patient investigation of the character of the\r\n  ‘Expositor,’ and the characters and designs of its proprietors, the\r\n  Constitution, the Charter (see Addenda to Nauvoo Charter from the\r\n  Springfield Charter, sec. 7), and all the best authorities on the\r\n  subject (see Blackstone, iii., 5, and n., etc., etc.), the City\r\n  Council decided that it was necessary for the ‘peace, benefit, good\r\n  order, and regulations’ of said city, ‘and for the protection of\r\n  property,’ and for ‘the happiness and prosperity of the citizens\r\n  of Nauvoo,’ that said ‘Expositor’ should be removed; and declaring\r\n  said ‘Expositor’ a nuisance, ordered the mayor to cause them to be\r\n  removed without delay, which order was committed to the marshal by\r\n  due process, and by him executed the same day, by removing the paper,\r\n  press, and fixtures into the streets, and burning the same; all which\r\n  was done without riot, noise, tumult, or confusion, as has already\r\n  been proved before the municipality of the city; and the particulars\r\n  of the whole transaction may be expected in our next ‘Nauvoo\r\n  Neighbor.’\r\n\r\n  “I send you this hasty sketch that your excellency may be aware of\r\n  the lying reports that are now being circulated by our enemies, that\r\n  there has been a ‘_mob_ at _Nauvoo_,’ and ‘_blood and thunder_,’\r\n  and ‘_swearing that two men were killed_,’ etc., etc., as we hear\r\n  from abroad, are false--false as Satan himself could invent, and\r\n  that nothing has been transacted here but what has been in perfect\r\n  accordance with the strictest principles of law and good order on\r\n  the part of the authorities of this city; and if your excellency is\r\n  not satisfied, and shall not be satisfied, after reading the whole\r\n  proceedings, which will be forthcoming soon, and shall demand an\r\n  investigation of our municipality before Judge Pope, or any legal\r\n  tribunal at the Capitol, you have only to write your wishes, and we\r\n  will be forthcoming; we will not trouble you to file a writ or send\r\n  an officer for us.\r\n\r\n  “I remain, as ever, a friend to truth, good order, and your\r\n  excellency’s humble servant,\r\n\r\n  (Signed), JOSEPH SMITH.\r\n\r\n  “His Excellency Thomas Ford.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nI think that the unpalatable assertion in the text will be proved by\r\nthe following contrasted extracts from the London “Times” and the\r\n“Deserét News.”\r\n\r\n  THE BLACK COUNTRY.--The reports of the assistant commissioners\r\n  engaged in the recent education inquiry contain some very painful\r\n  notices of the state of morals in some parts of the kingdom. In\r\n  collier villages in Durham, where the men earn high wages, which\r\n  they know no way of spending but in the gratification of animal\r\n  appetites, the condition of the people in respect to morals and\r\n  manners, it is said, may not be described. Adultery is made a matter\r\n  of mere jest, and incest also is frightfully common, and seems to\r\n  excite no disgust. In some of those parts girls mingle with boys\r\n  at school till 13, 14, or 15 years of age, and that in schools not\r\n  superintended by women; it is impossible to state the coarseness\r\n  of manners that prevails in these schools. Coming south, into\r\n  Staffordshire, we are told that in the union of Dudley, where boys\r\n  and girls can earn high wages, their independence of their parents’\r\n  aid to maintain them leads to a remarkable independence of conduct,\r\n  and, in fact, no restraint is put upon their inclinations either\r\n  by their parents or the opinion of the neighborhood. It is held\r\n  rather a shame to an unmarried woman not to have had a child; and\r\n  the assistant commissioner, Mr. Coode, says that the details given\r\n  to him by the most respectable and trustworthy witnesses would, if\r\n  they could be reported, be discredited by most men of the world only\r\n  acquainted with the ordinary profligacy of the poor; but he adds\r\n  that, notwithstanding all this, the behavior and manners in other\r\n  respects of girls and women is not in public less decent than that\r\n  in places of better repute, and it is generally asserted that this\r\n  early corruption of females does not hinder them from being very\r\n  good neighbors, and excellent, hard-working, and affectionate wives\r\n  and mothers. Education in this district is not much prized; it is\r\n  a common saying, “The father went to the pit and he made a fortune,\r\n  the son went to school and he lost it.” But so much has been done by\r\n  the upper classes in providing schools for the lower that education\r\n  is gradually making its way, and many who can not read are ashamed of\r\n  their deficiency, and desirous to have their children taught. In a\r\n  village where an energetic clergyman, who has adopted a rough, strong\r\n  style of preaching, has succeeded in filling his church, Mr. Coode\r\n  noticed during the service that all the people affected to find the\r\n  place in the books furnished to them, but full half the books were\r\n  held upside down, and within his observation not one was open at the\r\n  right place, except where some young person taught to read in the\r\n  school was by to find it.\r\n\r\n  _An Ordinance relating to Houses of Ill-fame and Prostitution._\r\n\r\n  Sec. 1. Be it ordained by the City Council of Great Salt Lake City,\r\n  that any person or persons who shall be found guilty of keeping,\r\n  or shall be an inmate of any house of ill-fame, or place for\r\n  the practice of fornication or adultery, or knowingly own or be\r\n  interested as proprietor or landlord of any such house, or any person\r\n  or persons harboring or keeping about his, her, or their private\r\n  premises any whore-master, strumpet, or whore, knowing them to be\r\n  guilty of following a lewd course of life, shall be liable to a fine\r\n  for each offense not exceeding one hundred dollars, or imprisonment\r\n  not exceeding six months, or both fine and imprisonment, at the\r\n  discretion of the court having jurisdiction. In a prosecution under\r\n  this section, the person having charge of any house or place shall be\r\n  deemed the keeper thereof.\r\n\r\n  Sec. 2. It shall be lawful, on the trial of any person before said\r\n  court charged with either of the offenses named in the preceding\r\n  section, for the city to introduce in support of such charge\r\n  testimony of the general character and reputation of the person or\r\n  place touching the offense or charge set forth in the complaint, and\r\n  the defendant may likewise resort to testimony of a like nature for\r\n  the purpose of disproving such charge.\r\n\r\n  Sec. 3. No person shall be incapacitated or excused from testifying\r\n  touching any offense committed by another against any of the\r\n  provisions set forth in the first section of this ordinance by reason\r\n  of his or her having participated in such crime, but the evidence\r\n  which may be given by such person shall in no case be used against\r\n  the person so testifying.\r\n\r\n  Sec. 4. The word adultery, as made use of in this ordinance, shall be\r\n  construed to mean the unlawfully cohabiting together of two persons\r\n  when either one or both of such persons are married; and the word\r\n  fornication shall be construed to mean the cohabiting together of two\r\n  unmarried persons.\r\n\r\n  Passed December 30th, 1860.\r\n\r\n  A. O. SMOOT, Mayor.\r\n\r\n  ROBERT CAMPBELL, City Recorder.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. CHRONOLOGICAL ABSTRACT OF MORMON HISTORY.\r\n\r\n  1801. June 1. Birth of Mr. Brigham Young, at Wittingham, Vermont, U.\r\n  S. In this year Mr. Heber C. Kimball also was born (June 14th).\r\n\r\n  1805. Dec. 23. Mr. Joseph Smith, jun., son of Mr. Joseph Smith, sen.,\r\n  generally called “Old Father Smith,” and Lucy Mack, known as “Mother\r\n  Smith,” born at Sharon, Windsor Co., Vermont.\r\n\r\n  1812. A book called the “Manuscript Found” was presented to Mr.\r\n  Patterson, a bookseller at Pittsburgh, Penn., by Mr. Solomon Spalding\r\n  or Spaulding, of Crawford, Penn.; born in Ashford Co., and a graduate\r\n  of Dartmouth College. The author died, the bookseller followed him\r\n  in 1826, and the book fell into the hands of a printer’s compositor,\r\n  Sidney Rigdon, one of the earliest Mormon converts. Anti-Mormons\r\n  identify parts of the “Book of Mormon” with the “Manuscript Found.”\r\n  The Saints deny the existence of a Patterson, and assert that Mr.\r\n  Spaulding’s book was a mere historical and idolatrous romance\r\n  concerning the Ten Lost Tribes, altogether different from their\r\n  Biblion. They trace the calumny to a certain Doctor (so called\r\n  because a seventh son) Philastus Hurlbert or Hurlbut, an apostate\r\n  excommunicated for gross immorality, and bound over in $500 to keep\r\n  the peace, after threatening to murder Mr. Joseph Smith, jun.; and\r\n  they observe that in those early days their Prophet was too unlearned\r\n  a man to adapt or to alter a manuscript.\r\n\r\n  1814. Mr. Joseph Smith, jun., powerfully awakened by the preaching of\r\n  Mr. Lane, an earnest Methodist minister.\r\n\r\n  1815. Mr. and Mrs. Smith removed with their family--Alvin, Hyrum,\r\n  Sophronia, Joseph, Samuel, Ephraim, William, and Catharine, from\r\n  Vermont to New York. They first lived at Palmyra, Wayne Co., for ten\r\n  years, and then passed on to Manchester, Ontario Co., the site of the\r\n  Hill Cumorah, where they tarried eleven or twelve years.\r\n\r\n  1820. Many religious revivals in Western New York. Mr. Joseph Smith\r\n  becomes partial to Methodism (J. Hyde, chap. viii.). Early in the\r\n  spring of the year occurred Mr. Joseph Smith, jun.’s first or\r\n  preparatory vision announcing his ministry.\r\n\r\n  1823. Sept. 20. Second vision; the Angel of the Lord revealed in\r\n  rather a solemn way to Mr. Joseph Smith, jun., the existence of the\r\n  Gold Plates, which, according to anti-Mormons, he and his brother\r\n  Hyrum had been employed in forging and fabricating for some years. On\r\n  the next day (22d) Mr. Joseph Smith, jun., opened the place where the\r\n  Plates were deposited and saw them.\r\n\r\n  1825. Mr. Joseph Smith, jun., was employed by a person called Stroude\r\n  to dig for him, near Hartwich, Oswego City, N. Y. Money-diggers were\r\n  then common in that part of the state, seeking the buried treasures\r\n  of Captain Kidd, the buccaneer. Near Hartwich, between the years\r\n  1818-1832, lived Mrs. Spaulding, and Mr. Joseph Smith, jun., stole\r\n  the “Manuscript Found” from a trunk full of papers (J. H).\r\n\r\n  1827. Jan. 18. Mr. Joseph Smith, jun., married Miss Emma Hale,\r\n  daughter of Isaac Hale, of South Bainbridge, Chenango Co., N. Y. This\r\n  person afterward became the Cyria Electa, or Elect Lady, and ended by\r\n  apostatizing and marrying a Gentile.\r\n\r\n  Sept. 22. The Golden Plates which the angel announced were taken up\r\n  from the Hill Cumorah with a mighty display of celestial machinery,\r\n  and the Breastplate and the Urim and Thummim were found. According to\r\n  Gentiles, the latter was a “peep-stone stolen from Willard Chase.”\r\n\r\n  1828. February. Martin Harris, a farmer from whom Mr. Joseph Smith,\r\n  jun., had borrowed $50 to defray expenses of printing the “Book of\r\n  Mormon,” submitted a transcript of the characters to Professor Anthon\r\n  and Dr. Mitchell of New York. The former pronounced them to be a\r\n  “singular scroll,” and “evidently copied after the Mexican Calendar\r\n  given by Humboldt.”\r\n\r\n  July. Translation of the “Book of Mormon” suspended in consequence\r\n  of Martin Harris stealing (116-118?) pages of the manuscript, which\r\n  were never replaced. For this reason he was not enrolled among the\r\n  glorious first six converts to Mormonism.\r\n\r\n  1829. April 16. Mr. Joseph Smith, jun., saw O. Cowdery the first\r\n  time. Translation of the “Book of Mormon” resumed, O. Cowdery acting\r\n  as secretary.\r\n\r\n  May 15. John the Baptist ordained into the Aaronic priesthood Mr.\r\n  Joseph Smith, jun., and O. Cowdery, his amanuensis, who forthwith\r\n  baptized each other.\r\n\r\n  June or July. The Plates of the “Book of Mormon” were shown by the\r\n  Angel of God to the three earthly witnesses--Oliver Cowdery, David\r\n  Whitmer, and Martin Harris.\r\n\r\n  1830. The “Book of Mormon” was translated and published, and this\r\n  year is No. 1 of the Mormon Æra.\r\n\r\n  April 6. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints was\r\n  organized at Manchester, N. Y. It began with six members or elders\r\n  being ordained, viz., Mr. Joseph Smith, sen., Mr. Hyrum Smith, Mr.\r\n  Joseph Smith, jun., Mr. Samuel Smith, Mr. Oliver Cowdery, and Mr.\r\n  Joseph Knight. The Sacrament was administered, and hands were laid on\r\n  for the gift of the Holy Ghost on this first occasion in the Church.\r\n\r\n  April 11. Oliver Cowdery preached the first public discourse on this\r\n  dispensation, and the principles of the Gospel as revealed to Mr.\r\n  Joseph Smith, jun.

Our houses have been plundered and then burned, our fields\r\n  laid waste, our principal men butchered while under the pledged\r\n  faith of the government for their safety, and our families driven\r\n  from their homes to find that shelter in the barren wilderness, and\r\n  that protection among hostile savages, which were denied them in the\r\n  boasted abodes of Christianity and civilization.\r\n\r\n  “The Constitution of our common country guarantees unto us all that\r\n  we do now or have ever claimed.\r\n\r\n  “If the constitutional rights which pertain unto us as American\r\n  citizens were extended to Utah, according to the spirit and meaning\r\n  thereof, and fairly and impartially administered, it is all that we\r\n  could ask--all that we have ever asked.\r\n\r\n  “Our opponents have availed themselves of prejudice existing against\r\n  us because of our religious faith to send out a formidable host to\r\n  accomplish our destruction. We have had no privilege, no opportunity\r\n  of defending ourselves from the false, foul, and unjust aspersions\r\n  against us before the nation. The government has not condescended\r\n  to cause an investigating committee or other person to be sent to\r\n  inquire into and ascertain the truth, as is customary in such cases.\r\n\r\n  “We know those aspersions to be false, but that avails us nothing.\r\n  We are condemned unheard, and forced to an issue with an armed\r\n  mercenary mob, which has been sent against us at the instigation\r\n  of anonymous letter-writers ashamed to father the base, slanderous\r\n  falsehoods which they have given to the public; of corrupt officials,\r\n  who have brought false accusations against us to screen themselves in\r\n  their own infamy; and of hireling priests and howling editors, who\r\n  prostitute the truth for filthy lucre’s sake.\r\n\r\n  “The issue which has been thus forced upon us compels us to resort\r\n  to the great first law of self-preservation, and stand in our own\r\n  defense--a right guaranteed unto us by the genius of the institutions\r\n  of our country, and upon which the government is based.\r\n\r\n  “Our duty to ourselves, to our families, requires us not to tamely\r\n  submit to be driven and slain without an attempt to preserve\r\n  ourselves. Our duty to our country, our holy religion, our God,\r\n  to freedom and liberty, requires that we should not quietly stand\r\n  still and see those fetters forging around which are calculated to\r\n  enslave and bring us in subjection to an unlawful military despotism,\r\n  such as can only emanate [in a country of constitutional law] from\r\n  usurpation, tyranny, and oppression.\r\n\r\n  “Therefore I, Brigham Young, Governor and Superintendent of Indian\r\n  Affairs for the Territory of Utah, in the name of the people of the\r\n  United States in the Territory of Utah,\r\n\r\n  “1st. Forbid all armed forces, of every description, from coming into\r\n  this Territory under any pretense whatever.\r\n\r\n  “2d. That all the forces in said Territory hold themselves in\r\n  readiness to march at a moment’s notice, to repel any and all such\r\n  invasion.\r\n\r\n  “3d. Martial law is hereby declared to exist in this Territory from\r\n  and after the publication of this proclamation; and no person shall\r\n  be allowed to pass or repass into, or through, or from this Territory\r\n  without a permit from the proper officer.\r\n\r\n  (L.S.)\r\n\r\n  “Given under my hand and seal at Great Salt Lake City, Territory of\r\n  Utah, this fifteenth day of September, A.D. eighteen hundred and\r\n  fifty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America\r\n  the eighty-second.\r\n\r\n  BRIGHAM YOUNG.”\r\n\r\nOct. 5-6. The Mormons, who were “spoiling for a fight,” burned, without\r\nthe orders of their governor, two provision trains, one of fifty-one\r\nand the other of twenty-three wagons, causing great want and violent\r\nexasperation in the army of Utah.\r\n\r\nNovember. Army of Utah encamped near Green River.\r\n\r\nNov. 21. Proclamation of Mr. Cumming, the new governor.\r\n\r\nDec. 15. Mr. Brigham Young’s message to the Legislature of Utah.\r\n\r\n1858. Jan. 16. Address of citizens of Great Salt Lake City sent to\r\nPresident Buchanan.\r\n\r\nFebruary. Colonel Kane reached Great Salt Lake City.\r\n\r\nApril 5. Governor A. Cumming appointed to Utah Territory after the\r\nthankless offer had been refused by sixteen or seventeen political\r\npersons; left Camp Scott, near Fort Bridger, and on the 12th of April\r\nentered Great Salt Lake City. The “rebellion in Utah” found to be a\r\npure invention.\r\n\r\nMr. Brigham Young, followed by 25,000 souls, marched to Provo, with\r\ntheir stock, flocks, and chattels, even their furniture.\r\n\r\nApril 15. Governor Cumming officially reported a respectful reception,\r\nand the illumination of Echo Kanyon; also that the records of the\r\nUnited States Courts, then in charge of a Mormon, Mr. W. H. Hooper,\r\nSecretary _pro tem._, the Territorial Library, in charge of Mr. W. C.\r\nStaines, and other public property, were all unimpaired, the contrary\r\nreport having constituted the _causa belli_.\r\n\r\nApril 24. Governor Cumming issued a proclamation that he would assume\r\neffective protection of all persons illegally restrained of their\r\nliberty in Utah. Few availed themselves of his offer. The Indian agent,\r\nDr. T. Garland Hurt, was accused of having incited the Uinta Indians to\r\nacts of hostility against the Mormons--a standing charge and counter\r\ncharge in the United States.\r\n\r\nMay 21. The governor made a requisition that “no hinderance may be\r\nhereafter presented to the commercial, postal, or social communications\r\nthroughout the Territory.”\r\n\r\nMay 29. The “Peace Commissioners” from Washington, ex-Governor\r\nLazarus W. Powell, of Kentucky, and Major Ben M‘Culloch, of Texas,\r\nthe celebrated Indian fighter, arrived at Great Salt Lake City (where\r\nthey staid till June 2), and after proclaiming a general amnesty and\r\nfree pardon, obtained permission for the army of Utah to enter the\r\nTerritory, and to encamp at a place not nearer than forty miles from\r\nNew Zion.\r\n\r\nJune 12. Mr. Brigham Young treated with the Peace Commissioners.\r\n\r\nJune 14. The President’s pardon “for all treasons and seditions” was\r\nproclaimed by the governor, and accepted by the citizens.\r\n\r\nJune 26. The federal troops, having left Camp Scott, passed through the\r\ndeserted City of the Saints, led by Lieutenant Colonel Cooke, who rode,\r\naccording to Mormon report, with head uncovered; they remained for two\r\ndays encamped on the Jordan, outside the settlement, and then moved\r\ntwelve to fifteen miles westward for wood and grass.\r\n\r\n1859. The Legislature sat at Great Salt Lake City.\r\n\r\nJudge Charles S. Sinclair attempted to break faith by misinterpreting\r\nthe amnesty, and nearly caused collision between the federal troops and\r\nthe Mormons.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. John Cradlebaugh, ex-officio judge of the Second Judicial\r\nDistrict Court, Utah Territory, quartered a company of 110 men in\r\nthe court-house and public buildings of Provo, thereby causing\r\ndisturbances; Governor Cumming protested against the proceeding.\r\n\r\nThe Deserét currency plates were seized at Mr. Brigham Young’s house.\r\n\r\nJan. 2. Religious service, interrupted by the war, again performed in\r\nthe Tabernacle.\r\n\r\nFeb. 28. Troubles between the citizens at Rush Valley and the federal\r\ntroops under General A. J. Johnston, commanding the Department of Utah.\r\n\r\nMarch 25. Mr. Howard Spencer, nephew of Mr. Daniel Spencer, was\r\nseverely wounded by First Sergeant Ralph Pike, Company I of the 10th\r\nRegiment.\r\n\r\nAug. 10. Sergeant Pike, summoned for trial to Great Salt Lake City, was\r\nshot in the street, it is supposed by Mr. H. Spencer.\r\n\r\nIn this month the citizens of Carson Valley declared themselves\r\nindependent of Utah Territory.\r\n\r\n1860. Mr. Forney, Indian Superintendent, Utah Territory, and highly\r\nhostile to the Mormons, was removed.\r\n\r\nTroubles with the troops. Mr. Heneage, a Mormon citizen, was flogged at\r\na cart’s tail by two federal officers under a little mistake.\r\n\r\nJune 20. Major Ormsby (militia) and his force destroyed by the Indians\r\nnear Honey Lake.\r\n\r\n1861. The federal troops evacuated the Land of the Saints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Aborigines, American. _See_ Indians.\r\n  Absinthe. _See_ Sage, wild.\r\n  Academy of the 7th Ward of Great Salt Lake City, 360.\r\n  Adobe manufactory near Great Salt Lake City, 344-5.\r\n  Adobe of the Western World, 197.\r\n  Adobe, origin of the name, 197, _note_.\r\n  Adoption among the North American Indians, 117.\r\n  Adoption, Mormon principle of, 269.\r\n  Adultery, Mormon punishment for, 426.\r\n  Agricultural Society of Deserét, 316.\r\n  Agriculture, list of premiums awarded at the annual show, 285-287,\r\n  _note_.\r\n  Agriculture, present state of, in Great Salt Lake Valley, 285.\r\n  Alamo. _See_ Cotton-wood-tree.\r\n  Albino, rarity of an, among the Indians, 104.\r\n  Albinos among buffaloes, 51.\r\n  Alcohol distilled in Great Salt Lake City, 320.\r\n  Alexander, Colonel B., his hospitality, 90.\r\n  Algæ in Great Salt Lake, 326.\r\n  Algarobia grandulosa, or mezquite-tree, 7.\r\n  Alkali Lake, 153.\r\n  Alkali Lake Station on the Platte River, 54.\r\n  Almanac, the, published in Utah, 253.\r\n  America, shape of the continent of, 6.\r\n  American Fork, 447.\r\n  “Americanisms, Dictionary of,” Bartlett’s, quoted, 17, _note_.\r\n  Animal life, absence of, on the Grand Prairie, 18.\r\n  Animal life, in the American Sahara, 64.\r\n  Animal worship of the American Indians, 108.\r\n  Animals and vegetables, confusing trivial names for, in America, 142,\r\n  _note_.\r\n  Animals, Indian signs for, 126.\r\n  Animals of the Uinta Hills, 178.\r\n  Animals, small quantity of food required to fatten, in the Rocky\r\n  Mountains and in Somaliland, 140.\r\n  Animals, wild, at Rocky Bridge, 159.\r\n  Animals, wild, in the wooded heights of the Wind-River Mountains, 165.\r\n  Animals, wild, of the Black Hills, 142.\r\n  Animals, wild, of the Rattlesnake Hills, 153.\r\n  Animals, wild, of Utah Territory, 279.\r\n  Antelope at Rocky Ridge, 159.\r\n  Antelope, its habitat, 67.\r\n  Antelope, its meat, 67.\r\n  Antelope or Church Island, 194, 323, 327.\r\n  Antelope Springs, 464, 465.\r\n  Antelope, the (Antelocapra Americana), 67.\r\n  Ant-hills, 196.\r\n  Apadomey female warriors, 113.\r\n  Arapaho, or Dirty-Nose Indians, 142, 143.\r\n  Arapaho, loose conduct of, 117.\r\n  Arapaho, sign of the tribe of, 123, 124.\r\n  Arapaho, their lodges, 86.\r\n  Arapaho, their personal appearance, 143, 144.\r\n  Arapaho, visit of some, from a neighboring camp, 142.\r\n  Archery, Sioux skill in, 120.\r\n  Arickaree, or Ree Indians, 37.\r\n  Arms of the North American Indians, 57, 119.\r\n  Arms, ignorance of the lower grades of English of the use of, 174.\r\n  Army of the United States, remarks on the, 336.\r\n  Army, grievances of the, 445.\r\n  Arroyo, fiumara or nullah, an, 70.\r\n  Arrow-poison of the Indians, 482.\r\n  Arrows of the North American Indian, 119, 120.\r\n  Arrow-wood (Viburnum dentatum), 119.\r\n  Art in America, remarks on, 186, 187.\r\n  Artemisia. _See_ Sage, wild.\r\n  Asclepias tuberosa, common in Utah Territory, 167.\r\n  Ash Hollow, 70.\r\n  Ash Hollow, General Harney’s defeat of the Brûlé Sioux at, 70, 89.\r\n  Ash-Hollow Creek, 70.\r\n  Assiniboin Indians, 97.\r\n  Assiniboin Indians, their present habitat, 100.\r\n  Assiniboin River, 100.\r\n  Aurora borealis, a splendid, in the prairies, 61.\r\n  Avena fatua of the Pacific Water-shed, 139.\r\n\r\n  Badeau’s Ranch, or Laramie City, 88.\r\n  Badgers at Rocky-Bridge Station, 161.\r\n  Bartlett’s “Dictionary of Americanisms” quoted, 17, _note_.\r\n  Basswood, 17.\r\n  “Basswood Mormons,” 17, _note_.\r\n  Bath, the hot air and water, of the North American Indian, 119.\r\n  Bathing and its dangers, 156.\r\n  Battle Creek, 447.\r\n  Bauchmin’s Creek, 189, 190.\r\n  Bauchmin’s Creek, valley of, 189.\r\n  Bauchmin’s Fork, 189.\r\n  Bauchmin’s Fork, station at, 189.\r\n  “Bear’s Rib,” Mato Chigukesa, made chief of the Brûlé Sioux, 89.\r\n  Bear Bay, 182.\r\n  Bear, flesh of the, as food, 231.\r\n  Bear, in Cotton-wood Kanyon, 347.\r\n  Bear, of the Black Hills, 142.\r\n  Bear River, 182, 183, 325.\r\n  Bear River, coal found on the banks of, 182.\r\n  Bear River Mountains, 174.\r\n  Bear Springs, in Utah Territory, 274.\r\n  Bear, the grizzly, 192.\r\n  Bear traps, 347.\r\n  Beavers in the torrent-bed of Echo Kanyon, 187.\r\n  Beavers, tails of, as food, 231.\r\n  Bedstead, populousness of, 202.\r\n  Bee, a, on the topmost summit of the Rocky Mountains, 165.\r\n  Bee House in Great Salt Lake City, 246.\r\n  Beer, or Soda Springs, 179.\r\n  Beer of Great Salt Lake City, 320.\r\n  Beet-root grown in Great Salt Lake Valley, 287.\r\n  Bell, Governor, of Great Salt Lake City, 215.\r\n  Bench-land of the Great Salt Lake Valley, 195.\r\n  Bennett, J.
