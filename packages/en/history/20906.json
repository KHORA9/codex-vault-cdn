III--JANUARY, 1918--No. 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF JOSIAH HENSON[1]\r\n\r\n\r\nNo one ever uttered a more forceful truth than Frederika Bremer when\r\nshe said in speaking to Americans: \"The fate of the Negro is the\r\nromance of your history.\" The sketches of heroes showing the life of\r\nthose once exploited by Christian men must ever be interesting to\r\nthose who would know the origin and the development of a civilization\r\ndistinctly American. In no case is this more striking than in that of\r\nJosiah Henson, the man who probably was present to Harriet Beecher\r\nStowe's mind when she graphically portrayed slavery in writing \"Uncle\r\nTom's Cabin.\"\r\n\r\nJosiah Henson was born June 15, 1789, on a farm in Charles County,\r\nMaryland, where his mother was hired out. His parents had six\r\nchildren. The only recollection he had of his father was that of\r\nseeing his right ear cut off, his head gashed and his back lacerated,\r\nas a result of the cruel punishment inflicted upon him because he had\r\ndared to beat the overseer of the plantation for brutally assaulting\r\nthe slave's wife. Because of becoming morose, disobedient and\r\nintractable thereafter, Henson's father was sold to a planter in\r\nAlabama and his relatives never heard of him again. His mother was\r\nthen brought back to the estate of her owner, a Doctor McPherson, who\r\nwas much kinder to his slaves. Dr. McPherson gave the youth his own\r\nname, Josiah, and the family name Henson after Dr. McPherson's uncle,\r\nwho served in the Revolutionary War. Josiah showed signs of mental and\r\nreligious development under the pious care of his Christian mother and\r\nfor that reason became his master's favorite.\r\n\r\nUpon the death of Doctor McPherson, however, it became necessary to\r\nsell the estate and slaves to divide his property among his heirs. The\r\nHenson family was then scattered throughout the country and worst of\r\nall Josiah was separated from his mother, notwithstanding his mother's\r\nearnest entreaty that her new master, Isaac Riley, should also\r\npurchase her baby. Instead of listening to the appeal of this\r\nafflicted woman clinging to his hands, he disengaged himself from her\r\nwith violent blows. She was then taken to Riley's farm in Montgomery\r\nCounty. Josiah was purchased by a man named Robb, a tavern keeper\r\nliving near Montgomery Court-House. Both masters were unusually cruel,\r\nin keeping with the tyrannical methods employed by planters of that\r\ntime. Because of ill health resulting from the lack of proper care,\r\nJosiah became very sickly. He was then providentially restored to his\r\nmother, having been offered to her owner by Robb for a small sum, for\r\nthe reason that it was thought that he would die.\r\n\r\nHis third master was \"vulgar in his habits, unprincipled and cruel in\r\nhis general deportment and especially addicted to the vice of\r\nlicentiousness.\"[2] On his plantation Henson served as water-boy,\r\nbutler and finally as a field hand, experiencing the usual hardship of\r\nthe slave. He ate twice a day of cornmeal and salt herring, with a\r\nlittle buttermilk and a few vegetables occasionally. His dress was\r\nfirst a single garment, something like a long shirt reaching to the\r\nankles, later a pair of trousers and a shirt with the addition of a\r\nwoolen hat once in two or three years and a round jacket or overcoat\r\nin the winter time. He slept with ten or a dozen persons in a log hut\r\nof a single small room, with no other floor than the trodden earth,\r\nand without beds or furniture. In spite of this, however, Henson grew\r\nto be a robust lad, who at the age of fifteen could do a man's work.\r\nHaving too more mental capacity than most slaves, he was regarded as a\r\nsmart fellow. Hearing remarks like this about himself, Henson became\r\nfilled with ambition and pride, and aspired to a position of influence\r\namong his fellows.\r\n\r\nAt times Henson would toil and induce his fellow slaves to work much\r\nharder and longer than required to obtain from their master a kind\r\nword or act, but these efforts usually produced no more from their\r\nowner than a cold calculation of the value of Josiah to him. When,\r\nhowever, the white overseer of this plantation was discharged for\r\nstealing from his employer, Josiah had shown himself so capable that\r\nhe was made manager of the plantation. In this position his honest\r\nmanagement of the estate made him indispensable to his master also as\r\na salesman of produce in the markets of Georgetown and Washington. He\r\nhad during these years come under the influence of an anti-slavery\r\nwhite man of Georgetown and had become a devout Christian with\r\nconsiderable influence as a preacher among the slaves.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, Josiah was serving his master in another capacity,\r\nwhich brought upon him one of the greatest misfortunes of his life.\r\nThis was accompanying his master to town for protection and\r\ndeliverance when the owners of his order indulged in excessive\r\ndrinking and brawls in taverns. Sometimes in removing his master from\r\nthe midst of a fracas, he would have to handle his owner's opponent\r\nrather roughly. On one occasion when Riley became involved in a\r\nquarrel with his brother's overseer, Henson pushed the overseer down;\r\nand falling while intoxicated the overseer suffered some injury. The\r\noverseer decided to wreak vengeance on Henson for this. Finding\r\nHenson on the way home one day the overseer assisted by three Negroes\r\nattacked him, beating him unmercifully and left him on the ground\r\nalmost senseless with his head badly bruised and cut and with his\r\nright arm and both shoulder blades broken. Being on a farm where no\r\nphysician or surgeon was usually called, Henson recovered with\r\ndifficulty under the kind treatment of his master's sister; but was\r\nnever able thereafter to raise his hands to his head. The culprit did\r\nnot suffer for this offense, as the court acquitted him on the grounds\r\nof self-defense.\r\n\r\nIn the course of time Henson's master, Isaac Riley, lived so\r\nextravagantly that he became involved in debt and lawsuits which\r\nheralded his ruin. Seeing his estate would be seized, he intrusted to\r\nHenson in 1825 the tremendous task of taking his 18 slaves to his\r\nbrother, Amos Riley, in Kentucky. Henson bought a one-horse wagon to\r\ncarry provisions and to relieve the women and children from time to\r\ntime. The men were compelled to walk altogether. Traveling through\r\nAlexandria, Culpepper, Fauquier, Harper's Ferry and Cumberland, they\r\nmet on the way droves of Negroes passing in chains under the system of\r\nthe internal slave trade, while those whom Henson was conducting were\r\nmoving freely without restriction. On arriving at Wheeling, he sold\r\nthe horse and wagon and bought a boat of sufficient size to take the\r\nwhole party down the river. At Cincinnati some free Negroes came out\r\nto greet them and urged them to avail themselves of the opportunity to\r\nbecome free. Few of the slaves except Henson could appreciate this\r\nboon offered them, but he had thought of obtaining it only by\r\npurchase. Henson said: \"Under the influence of these impressions, and\r\nseeing that the allurements of the crowd were producing a manifest\r\neffect, I sternly assumed the captain, and ordered the boat to be\r\npushed off into the stream. A shower of curses followed me from the\r\nshore; but the Negroes under me, accustomed to obey, and, alas! too\r\ndegraded and ignorant of the advantages of liberty to know what they\r\nwere forfeiting, offered no resistance to my command.\" \"Often since\r\nthat day,\" says he, \"has my soul been pierced with bitter anguish at\r\nthe thought of having been thus instrumental in consigning to the\r\ninfernal bondage of slavery so many of my fellow-beings. I have\r\nwrestled in prayer with God for forgiveness. Having experienced myself\r\nthe sweetness of liberty, and knowing too well the after misery of a\r\ngreat majority of them, my infatuation has seemed to me an\r\nunpardonable sin. But I console myself with the thought that I acted\r\naccording to my best light, though the light that was in me was\r\ndarkness.\"[3]\r\n\r\nHenson finally arrived with these slaves at the farm of his master's\r\nbrother, five miles south of the Ohio and fifteen miles above the\r\nYellow Banks, on the Big Blackfords' Creek in Davies County, Kentucky,\r\nApril, 1825. Here the situation as to food, shelter and general\r\ncomforts was a little better than in Maryland. He served on this\r\nplantation as superintendent and having here among more liberal white\r\npeople the opportunity for religious instruction, he developed into a\r\nsuccessful preacher, recognized by the Conference of the Methodist\r\nEpiscopal Church.\r\n\r\nThere he remained waiting for his master three years. Unable to\r\npersuade his wife to move to Kentucky, however, his master decided to\r\nabandon the idea and sent an agent to bring upon those slaves another\r\nheartrending scene of the auction block, though Henson himself was\r\nexempted. Henson saw with deepest grief the agony which he recollected\r\nin his own mother and which he now unfortunately said in the persons\r\nwith whom he had long been associated. He could not, therefore,\r\nrefrain from experiencing the bitterest feeling of hatred of the\r\nsystem and its promoters. He furthermore lamented as never before his\r\nagency in bringing the poor creatures hither, if such had to be the\r\nend of the expedition. Freedom then became the all-absorbing purpose\r\nthat filled his soul. He said that he stood ready to pray, toil,\r\ndissemble, plot like a fox and fight like a tiger.\r\n\r\nA new light dawned upon the dark pathway of Josiah Henson, however, in\r\n1828. A Methodist preacher, an anti-slavery white man, talked with\r\nHenson one day confidentially about securing freedom. He thereupon\r\nsuggested to Henson to obtain his employer's consent to visit his old\r\nmaster in Maryland that he might connect with friends in Ohio along\r\nthe way and obtain the sum necessary to purchase himself. His employer\r\nreadily consented and with the required pass and a letter of\r\nrecommendation from his Methodist friend to a preacher in Cincinnati,\r\nHenson obtained contributions to the amount of one hundred and sixty\r\ndollars on arriving in that city, where he preached to several\r\ncongregations. He then proceeded to Chillicothe where the annual\r\nMethodist Conference was in session, his kind friend accompanying him.\r\nWith the aid of the influence and exertions of his coworker Henson was\r\nagain successful. He then purchased a suit of comfortable clothes and\r\nan excellent horse, with which he traveled leisurely from town to\r\ntown, preaching and soliciting as he went. He succeeded so well that\r\nwhen he arrived at his old home in Maryland, he was much better\r\nequipped than his master. This striking difference and the delay of\r\nHenson along the way from September to Christmas caused his master to\r\nbe somewhat angry. Moreover, as his master had lost most of his slaves\r\nand other property in Maryland, he was anxious to have Henson as a\r\nfaithful worker to retrieve his losses; but this changed man would\r\nhardly subserve such a purpose.\r\n\r\nThe conditions which he observed around him were so much worse than\r\nwhat he had for some time been accustomed to and so changed was the\r\nenvironment because of the departure or death of friends and relatives\r\nduring his absence that Henson resolved to become free. He then\r\nconsulted the brother of his master's wife, then a business man in\r\nWashington, whom he had often befriended years before and who was\r\nangry with Henson's master because the latter had defrauded him out of\r\ncertain property. This friend, therefore, gladly took up with Henson's\r\nmaster the question of giving the slave an opportunity to purchase\r\nhimself. He carefully explained to the master that Henson had some\r\nmoney and could purchase himself and that if, in consideration of the\r\nvaluable services he had rendered, the master refused to do so, Henson\r\nwould become free by escaping to Canada. The master agreed then to\r\ngive him his manumission papers for four hundred and fifty dollars, of\r\nwhich three hundred and fifty dollars was to be in cash and the\r\nremainder in Henson's note. Henson's money and horse enabled him to\r\npay the cash at once. But his master was to work a trick on him. He\r\ndid not receive his manumission papers until March 3, 1827, and when\r\nHenson started for Kentucky his master induced him to let him send his\r\nmanumission papers to his brother in Kentucky where Henson was\r\nreturning, telling him that some ruffian might take the document from\r\nhim on the way. In returning to Kentucky Henson was arrested several\r\ntimes as a fugitive, but upon always insisting on being carried before\r\na magistrate he was released. He had no trouble after reaching\r\nWheeling, from which he proceeded on a boat to Davies County,\r\nKentucky.\r\n\r\nArriving at the Kentucky home, he was informed that the master had\r\nmisrepresented the facts as to his purchase. He had written his\r\nbrother that Henson had agreed to pay one thousand dollars for\r\nhimself, the balance-of the six hundred and fifty dollars to be paid\r\nin Kentucky. As the only evidence he had, had been sent to his\r\nmaster's brother, it was impossible for him to make a case against him\r\nin court. Things went on in uncertainty for about a year. Then came a\r\ncomplaint from his master in Maryland, saying that he wanted money and\r\nexpressing the hope that Henson would soon pay the next installment.\r\n\r\nSoon thereafter Henson received orders to go with Amos Riley carrying\r\na cargo to New Orleans. This suggestion was enough. He contrived to\r\nhave his manumission papers sewed up in his clothing prior to his\r\ndeparture on the flat boat for New Orleans. He knew what awaited him\r\nand his mind rapidly developed into a sort of smoldering volcano of\r\npent-up feeling which at one time all but impelled him to murder his\r\nwhite betrayers. Blinded by passion and stung by madness, Henson\r\nresolved to kill his four companions, to take what money they had,\r\nthen to scuttle the craft and escape to the North. One dark night\r\nwithin a few days' sail of New Orleans it seemed that the opportune\r\nhour had come. Henson was alone on the deck and Riley and the hands\r\nwere asleep. He crept down noiselessly, secured an ax, entered the\r\ncabin, and looking by aid of the dim light, his eye fell first on\r\nRiley. Henson felt the blade of the ax and raised it to strike the\r\nfirst blow when suddenly the thought came to him, \"What! Commit\r\nmurder, and you a Christian?\" His religious feeling and belief in the\r\nwonderful providence of God prevented him.\r\n\r\nRiley talked later of getting him a good master and the like but did\r\nnot disguise the effort to sell him. Fortunately, however, Amos Riley\r\nwas suddenly taken sick and becoming more dependent on Henson then,\r\nthan Henson had been on him, he immediately ordered Henson to sell the\r\nflat boat and find passage for him home in a sick cabin at once.\r\nHenson did this and succeeded by careful nursing to get Amos back to\r\nhis home in Kentucky alive. Although he confessed that, if he had sold\r\nHenson, he would have died, the family showed only a realization of an\r\nincreased value in Henson rather than an appreciation of his valuable\r\nservices. He, therefore, decided to escape to Canada.\r\n\r\nHis wife, fearing the dangers, would not at first agree to go, but\r\nupon being told that he would take all of the children but the\r\nyoungest, she finally agreed to set out with him. Knowing of the\r\nhardships that they must have to experience, Henson practised\r\nbeforehand the carrying of the children on his back. They crossed the\r\nriver into Indiana and proceeded toward Cincinnati, finding it\r\ndifficult to purchase food in that State, so intensely did the people\r\nhate the Negro there. After two weeks of hardship, exhausted they\r\nreached Cincinnati. There they were refreshed and carried 30 miles on\r\nthe way in a wagon. They directed themselves then toward the Scioto,\r\nwhere they were told they would strike the military road of General\r\nHull, opened when he was operating against Detroit.\r\n\r\nThey set out, not knowing that the way lay through a wilderness of\r\nhowling wolves and, not taking sufficient food, they did not pass\r\nhomes from which they could purchase supplies on the way. They did not\r\ngo far before his wife fainted, but she was soon resuscitated.\r\nFinally, they saw in the distance persons whose presence seemed to be\r\nthe dark foreboding of disaster, but the fugitives pressed on. They\r\nproved to be Indians, who, when they saw the blacks, ran away yelping.\r\nThis excited the fugitives, as they thought the Indians were yelling\r\nto secure the cooperation of a larger number to massacre them. Farther\r\non they saw other Indians standing behind trees hiding. After passing\r\nthrough such trials as these for some time they came to an Indian\r\nvillage, the dwellers of which, after some fear and hesitation,\r\nwelcomed them, supplied their wants and gave them a comfortable wigwam\r\nfor the night. They were then informed that they were about\r\ntwenty-five miles from the lakes. After experiencing some difficulty\r\nin fording a dangerous stream and spending another night in the woods\r\nthey saw the houses on the outskirts; of Sandusky.\r\n\r\nUsing good judgment, however, Henson did not go into the village at\r\nonce. When about a mile from the lake, He hid his family in the woods\r\nand then proceeded to approach the town. Soon he observed on the left\r\nside of the town a house from which a number of men were taking\r\nsomething to a vessel. Approaching them immediately he was asked\r\nwhether or not he desired to work. He promptly replied in the\r\naffirmative and it was not long before he was assisting them in\r\nloading corn. He soon contrived to get in line next to the only Negro\r\nthere engaged and communicated to him his plans.[4]\r\n\r\nHe told the captain, who called Henson aside and agreed to assist him\r\nin getting to Buffalo, the boat's destination, where the fugitives\r\nwould find friends. It was agreed that the vessel should leave the\r\nlanding and that a small boat should take the fugitives aboard at\r\nnight, as there were Kentucky spies in Sandusky that might apprehend\r\nthem. Henson said he watched the vessel leave the landing and then\r\nlower a boat for the shore and in a few minutes his black friend and\r\ntwo sailors landed and went with him to get his family. Thinking that\r\nhe had been captured his wife had grown despondent and had moved from\r\nthe spot where he left her. With a little difficulty, he found her,\r\nbut when she saw him approaching with those men, she was still more\r\nfrightened. She was reassured, however, and soon they were received on\r\nboard in the midst of hearty cheers. They arrived at Buffalo the next\r\nevening too late to cross the river. The following morning they were\r\nbrought to Burnham and went on the ferry boat to Waterloo. The good\r\nCaptain Burnham paid the passage money and gave Henson a dollar\r\nbeside. They arrived in Canada on the 28th day of October, 1830.\r\nDescribing his exultation Henson said: \"I threw myself on the ground,\r\nrolled in the sand, seized handfuls of it and kissed them, and danced\r\nround till, in the eyes of several who were present, I passed for a\r\nmadman. 'He's some crazy fellow,' said a Colonel Warren, who happened\r\nto be there. 'O, no, master! don't you know? I'm free!' He burst into\r\na shout of laughter. 'Well I never knew freedom make a man roll in the\r\nsand in such a fashion,' Still I could not control myself. I hugged\r\nand kissed my wife and children, and, until the first exuberant burst\r\nof feeling was over, went on as before.\"\r\n\r\nHe soon found employment there with one Mr. Hibbard, whom he served\r\nthree years and was lodged in a cabin better than that in Kentucky.\r\nHis family, however, had been so exposed that during the first winter\r\nthey almost died of sickness, but his employer was kind to him. Mr.\r\nHibbard taught Henson's son Tom, then twelve years of age. Tom's\r\nachievements were soon such that instead of reading the Bible to his\r\nfather to assist him in preaching he taught his father to read.\r\nHenson then entered the service of one Mr. Risely, who had experienced\r\nmore elevation of mind than Mr. Hibbard. With this advantage Henson\r\nnot only realized more fully than ever the ignorance in which he\r\nlived, but became interested in the elevation of his people there, who\r\nhad been content with the mere making a livelihood rather than solving\r\nthe economic problems of freedom. A good many, thereafter, agreed to\r\ninvest their savings in land. In this they had the cooperation of Mr.\r\nRisely. Henson set out, therefore, in 1834 to explore the country and\r\nfinally selected a place for a settlement to the east of Lake St.\r\nClair and Detroit river later called Colchester.\r\n\r\nHenson thereafter directed his attention to those whom he had left in\r\nbondage. If he felt any compunction of conscience for having conducted\r\nthe party of Maryland slaves through a free State without making an\r\neffort to free them, he made up for that in later years. Addressing an\r\naudience of Negroes some years later at Fort Erie, Pennsylvania, he\r\ntook occasion to remind them of their duty to assist in the\r\nemancipation of their fellowmen in the South. In the audience was a\r\nyoung man named James Lightfoot, who had fled from a plantation near\r\nMaysville, Kentucky. Seeing his duty as never before, he approached\r\nFather Henson to arrange for the rescue of his enslaved kinsmen.\r\nKnowing the agony in which he was, Henson undertook the perilous task\r\nof bringing them to Canada. Leaving his family alone he traveled on\r\nfoot through New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio into Kentucky. He had\r\nlittle difficulty in finding the Lightfoots. On presenting them a\r\nsmall token of the loved one, who, they were told, had gone to the\r\nland of freedom, they exhibited no little excitement. Unfortunately,\r\nhowever, Lightfoot's parents were so far advanced in years and his\r\nsisters had so many children that they could not travel. As the young\r\nmen, who could have gone, were not anxious to be separated from their\r\nloved ones, all declined the invitation to make this effort for\r\nfreedom at that time, promising to undertake it a year thereafter, if\r\nHenson returned for them.\r\n\r\nHenson agreed to do so and in the meantime went forty or fifty miles\r\ninto Bourbon County in the interior of Kentucky in quest of a large\r\nparty of Negroes who were said to be ready to escape. After a search\r\nfor about a week he discovered that there were about thirty fugitives\r\ncollected from various States. With them he started on the return trip\r\nto Canada, traveling by night and resting by day. They contrived to\r\ncross the Ohio river and reached Cincinnati in three days. There they\r\nwere assisted and directed to Richmond, Indiana, a settlement of\r\nQuakers, who helped them on their way. After a difficult journey of\r\ntwo weeks they reached Toledo and took passage for Canada, which they\r\nreached in safety.\r\n\r\nHenson then remained on his farm in Canada some months, but when the\r\nappointed time for the delivery of the enslaved kinsmen of James\r\nLightfoot arrived, he set out again for Kentucky. He passed through\r\nLancaster, Ohio, where the people were very much excited over a\r\nmeteoric shower, thinking that the day of judgment had come. Henson\r\nthought so too, but believing that he was promoting a righteous cause,\r\nhe kept on. On arriving at Portsmouth on the Ohio, he narrowly escaped\r\nbeing detected by Kentuckians in the town. He resorted to the\r\nstratagem of binding his head with dried leaves in a cloth and\r\npretended to be so seriously afflicted that he could not speak.\r\nArriving at Maysville, he had little difficulty in finding the slaves\r\nwhom he was seeking. The second person whom he met was Jefferson\r\nLightfoot, the brother of James Lightfoot for whom Henson was making\r\nthis trip. Saturday night, as usual, was set as the time for the\r\nexecution of this affair, for the reason that they would not be missed\r\nuntil Monday and would, therefore, have a day ahead. They started from\r\nMaysville in a boat, hoping to reach Cincinnati before daylight, but\r\nthe boat sprang a leak and the party narrowly escaped being drowned.\r\nThey procured another boat, however, and got within ten miles of\r\nCincinnati before daylight. To avoid being detected, they abandoned\r\nthe boat and proceeded to walk to Cincinnati, but faced another\r\ndifficulty when they reached the Miami, which at that point was too\r\ndeep to be forded. But in going up the river seeking a shallow place\r\nthey were seemingly led providentially by a cow that waded across\r\nbefore them. As the weather was cold and they were in a state of\r\nperspiration on wading through, the youngest Lightfoot was seized with\r\nserious contractions, but recovered after receiving such ministrations\r\nas could be given on the way. They were assisted in Cincinnati and the\r\nnext day started on their journey to Canada. They had not gone far\r\nbefore the young Lightfoot became so seriously ill that he had to be\r\ncarried on a litter, and this became so irksome that he himself begged\r\nto be left in the wilderness to die alone rather than handicap the\r\nwhole party with such good prospects for freedom. With considerable\r\nreluctance, they acceded to his request, and sad indeed was the\r\nparting. But before they had gone more than two miles on their journey\r\none of the brothers of the sick man suddenly decided to return, as he\r\ncould not suffer to have his brother die thus in the wilderness, and\r\nbe devoured by wolves. They returned and found the young man seemingly\r\nin a dying condition. They at once decided to resume their journey and\r\nhad not gone far before they saw a Quaker whose _thee_ and _thou_ led\r\nthem to believe that he was their friend. They then told him their\r\nstory, which was sufficient. He immediately returned home, taking them\r\nwith him. The fugitives remained there for the night and arranged for\r\nthe boy to remain with the Quaker until he should recover. They were\r\nthen provided with a sack of biscuit and a supply of meat, with which\r\nthey set out again for Canada. After proceeding a little further they\r\nmet a white man, who became helpful to them in escaping the slave\r\nhunters who were then on their trail. This man while working for an\r\nemployer who undertook to punish him had used violence and had to run\r\noff. The party, knowing the increasing danger of capture, walked all\r\nnight, trying to cover the distance of forty miles. At daybreak they\r\nreached a wayside tavern near Lake Erie and ordered breakfast. While\r\nthe meal was in preparation they quickly fell asleep. Just as the\r\nbreakfast was ready, however, Henson had the peculiar presentiment\r\nthat some danger was near and that he should at once leave the house.\r\nAfter experiencing some difficulty in persuading the fugitives to\r\nleave the tavern quickly they agreed to follow his orders. They had\r\nhardly left the tavern when they heard the tramping of the horses of\r\nthe slave hunters. They hid themselves in some bushes nearby which\r\noverlooked the road. The Lightfoots quickly recognized the slave\r\nhunters and whispered their names to Henson as they passed by. This\r\nwas the critical moment of their lives. Had they remained in the house\r\na few minutes longer they would have been apprehended. Their white\r\nfriend proceeded to the door in advance of the landlord and when asked\r\nas to whether he had seen any slaves said that he had, that there were\r\nsix of them and that they had gone toward Detroit. The slave-hunters\r\nat once set out in that direction. The fugitives returned to the\r\nhouse, devoured their breakfast immediately and secured the assistance\r\nof the landlord, who hearing their piteous story agreed to take them\r\nin his boat to Canada. In the language of Henson, \"Their bosoms were\r\nswelling with inexpressible joy as they mounted the seats of the boat,\r\nready, eager, to spring forward, that they might touch the soil of the\r\nfreeman. And when they reached the shore, they danced and wept for joy\r\nand kissed the earth on which they first stepped, no longer _slaves_\r\nbut _freemen_.\"[5]\r\n\r\nWithin a short time thereafter the boy whom they had left in dying\r\ncondition on the way reached them on the free soil of Canada in good\r\nhealth. And Frank Taylor, the master of these fugitives, on recovering\r\nfrom an attack of insanity which apparently resulted from the loss of\r\nthese slaves was persuaded by his friends to free the remaining\r\nmembers of the Lightfoot family, an act which he finally performed,\r\nenabling them after a few years to join their loved ones beyond the\r\nborders of the land of the slave. In this way Henson became\r\ninstrumental in effecting the escape of as many as one hundred and\r\neighteen slaves.[6]\r\n\r\nThe next important work was the establishment of the British American\r\nManual Labor Institute in connection with Reverend Hiram Wilson. After\r\nworking out a tentative plan, Wilson wrote James O. Fuller, residing\r\nin the State of New York, and interested him in the free Negroes of\r\nCanada West. On a trip to England Mr. Fuller raised $1,500 for this\r\npurpose. A convention of the leading refugees in Canada West was then\r\ncalled to decide exactly how this money should be spent. Henson urged\r\nthat it be appropriated to the establishment of a manual labor school,\r\nwhere children could be taught the elements of knowledge which are\r\nusually the courses of a grammar school; and where the boys could be\r\ngiven, in addition, the practice of some mechanic art and the girls\r\ncould be instructed in those domestic arts which are the proper\r\noccupations of their sex. Such a school he though would so equip the\r\nNegro youth as to enable him to take over much of the work then being\r\ndone by white teachers. This was then necessary, owing to the\r\nprejudice arising against the coeducation of the whites and blacks and\r\nthe stigma attached to teachers of Negroes. For this purpose two\r\nhundred acres of land were bought on the river Sydenham. In 1842 the\r\nschool was established at Dawn, to which Henson moved with his family.\r\nHenson traveled in New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Maine in\r\nthe interest of the institution and obtained many gifts, especially\r\nfrom Boston, the liberal people of which gave him sufficient funds to\r\nmaintain it some time.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this school there was established a saw-mill, the\r\nbuilding and the equipment of which was secured by Henson also from\r\nphilanthropists in Boston. These gentlemen were Rev. Ephraim Peabody,\r\nAmos Lawrence, H. Ingersoll Bowditch, and Samuel Elliot. Henson then\r\nproceeded to have walnut sawed in Canada and shipped to Boston. He\r\nsold his first eighty thousand feet to Jonas Chickering, at forty-five\r\ndollars a thousand. The second cargo was shipped to Boston via the St.\r\nLawrence and brought Henson a handsome profit. This business not only\r\nbecame profitable to the persons directly interested in it but proved\r\nto be an asset of the whole section.\r\n\r\nIn the course of time, however, the institution became heavily\r\nindebted and some means of relief had to be found. At a meeting of the\r\ntrustees it was decided to separate the management of the mill from\r\nthat of the school. It was easy to find some one to take over the\r\nschool, but few dared to think of assuming the management of the mill,\r\nwhich was indebted to the amount of seven thousand five hundred\r\ndollars. Henson accepted the management of the latter on the condition\r\nthat Peter B. Smith would assume an equal share of the responsibility.\r\nHenson then proceeded to England to raise funds to pay the debts of\r\nthe mill. Well supplied with letters of recommendation from some of\r\nthe most prominent men in the United States, he easily connected with\r\nmen of the same class in England. But before he could raise more than\r\nseventeen hundred dollars, an enemy, jealous of his success,\r\ncirculated through the press the report that he was an imposter and\r\nwas not authorized to solicit funds for any such purpose.[7] This, of\r\ncourse, frustrated his plans, but the English people were kind to him.\r\nThey sent an agent, John Scobell, to Canada to inquire into the\r\nmatter, Henson accompanying him. A thorough investigation of the\r\naffairs of the institution was made and the charges were repudiated.\r\nThe person who circulated them even denied that he had done so. Upon\r\nreturning to England Mr. Scobell informed Henson that should he ever\r\ndesire to return to England, he would find in the hands of Amos\r\nLawrence, of Boston, a draft to cover his expenses. Henson did return\r\nin 1851 and raised sufficient money to cancel the entire indebtedness\r\nof the institution. He was compelled to return to Canada soon after\r\nhis arrival, however, on account of the fatal illness of his wife, who\r\npassed away in 1852.\r\n\r\nHow Father Henson claimed to be the original Uncle Tom of Mrs. Stowe's\r\nimmortal story is more than interesting. Laboring in the anti-slavery\r\ncause, Henson traveled in Canada and New England, where he was\r\nwelcomed to the pulpits of ministers of all denominations. Once when\r\nhe was in the vicinity of Andover, Massachusetts, Mrs. Stowe sent for\r\nhim and his traveling companion, Mr. George Clarke, a white gentleman\r\npromoting the abolition of slavery by singing at anti-slavery\r\nmeetings. Mrs. Stowe became deeply interested in Henson's story and\r\nhad him narrate in detail the many varied experiences of his eventful\r\nlife. He told her, moreover, about the life of the slave in several\r\nsections and the peculiarities of many slaveholders. Soon thereafter\r\nappeared \"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\" Henson said that the white slaves,\r\nGeorge and Eliza Harris, were his particular friends. Harris's real\r\nname was Lewis Clark, who traveled and lectured with Henson in New\r\nEngland. Clark and his wife lived in Canada and finally moved to\r\nOberlin to educate their children. Furthermore, Henson says there was\r\non his plantation a clear-minded, sharp Negro girl, Dinah, who was\r\nalmost like Mrs. Stowe's Topsy and that a gentleman Mr. St. Clair\r\nlived in his neighborhood. Bryce Litton, who broke Henson's arms and\r\nso maimed him for life that he could never thereafter touch the top of\r\nhis head, he thought, would well represent Mrs. Stowe's cruel Legree.\r\nIt has been denied that he was this hero.\r\n\r\nWhen Henson was in England he had the good fortune to exhibit at the\r\nWorld's Fair there some of his beautifully polished walnut lumber,\r\nwhich Mr. Jonas Chickering sent over for him. The only exhibitor of\r\ncolor, he attracted attention from many, among whom was Queen\r\nVictoria, who in passing by was saluted by Henson, which salutation\r\nwas returned. She inquired as to whether the exhibit he had charge of\r\nwas his work. At the close of the exhibition Henson received a large\r\nquarto bound volume describing the exhibits and listing the\r\nexhibitors, among whom was found Josiah Henson. In addition he was\r\nawarded a bronze medal, a beautiful picture of the Queen and royal\r\nfamily of life size and several other objects of interest.\r\n\r\nWhile in England Henson had the privilege of meeting some of its most\r\ndistinguished citizens. He introduced himself to the thinkers of the\r\ncountry when, upon hearing an eminent man from Pennsylvania tell the\r\nSabbath-School Union that all classes in the United States\r\nindiscriminately enjoyed religious instruction. Henson demanded a\r\nhearing and successfully refuted the misrepresentation. Having a\r\nstanding invitation, he dined alternately with Samuel Morley and\r\nGeorge Hitchcock, Esq., of St. Paul's Church Yard. Upon meeting Lord\r\nGrey, Henson was asked by the gentleman to go to India to introduce\r\nthe culture of cotton, promising him an appointment to an office\r\npaying a handsome salary. Through Samuel Guerney, Henson had a long\r\ninterview with the Archbishop of Canterbury, who was so impressed with\r\nHenson's bearing and culture that he inquired as to the university\r\nfrom which he was graduated. Henson replied, _The University of\r\nAdversity_. After listening to Henson's experiences for more than an\r\nhour he followed him to the door and begged him to come to see him\r\nagain. He then attended a large picnic of Sabbath-School teachers on\r\nthe grounds of Lord John Russell, then Prime Minister of England.\r\nSitting down to dinner, Henson was given the seat of honor at the head\r\nof the table with such guests as Reverend William Brock, Honorable\r\nSamuel M. Peto and Mr. Bess.\r\n\r\nNear the end of his career Henson had many things to trouble him. The\r\ndivided management of the British American Manual Labor Institute and\r\nthe saw-mill proved a failure. The trustees who got control of it\r\npromised to make something new of it but did not administer the\r\naffairs successfully and they were involved in law suits there with\r\nthe Negroes, who endeavored to obtain control of it. It finally\r\nfailed, despite the fact that the court of chancery appointed a new\r\nboard of trustees and granted a bill to incorporate the institution as\r\nWilberforce University, which existed a few years.\r\n\r\nHenson showed his patriotism in serving as captain to the second Essex\r\ncompany of colored volunteers in the Canadian Rebellion, going to the\r\naid of the government which gave them asylum from slavery. His company\r\nheld Fort Maiden from Christmas until the following May and also took\r\nthe schooner _Ann_ with three hundred arms and two cannons, musketry\r\nand provisions for the rebel troops. They held the fort until they\r\nwere relieved by the colonel of the 44th regiment from England. Then\r\ncame the Civil War. Henson was too old to go, but his relatives\r\nenlisted. He was charged with having violated the foreign enlistment\r\nact and was arrested and acquitted after some harrowing experiences.\r\n\r\nHenson made a third trip to England near the close of his career. Many\r\nof his friends had passed away, but he met his old supporter, Samuel\r\nMorley. He made the acquaintance also of Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton\r\nHart, R. C. L. Bevan, and Professor Fowler. But he was then the hero\r\nof \"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\" The English people had read of him. They then\r\nwanted to see him. He spoke at the Victoria Park Tabernacle and held\r\nin London a farewell meeting in Spurgeon's Tabernacle. The buildings\r\nwere thronged to their utmost capacity and eager crowds on the outside\r\nmade desperate efforts to see him. He was then called to Scotland that\r\nthe people farther north might also see this hero. Just as Henson\r\nreached Edinburgh the crowning honor of his life was to come. He\r\nreceived a telegram from Queen Victoria inviting him to visit her the\r\nfollowing day. After addressing an unusually large audience, Henson\r\nproceeded immediately to London. The next day he and his wife were\r\ndined by a group of distinguished gentlemen and were then taken to\r\nWindsor Castle, where they were presented to Queen Victoria. Her\r\nmajesty informed him that he had known of him ever since she was a\r\nlittle girl. She expressed her surprise at seeing him look so\r\ndifferent from what she had imagined he would. She briefly discussed\r\nwith him the state of affairs in Canada, and in bidding him and his\r\nwife farewell expressed her wish for his continued prosperity, gave\r\nhim a token of her respect and esteem, consisting of a full length\r\ncabinet photograph of herself in an elegant easel frame of gold.\r\n\r\nOn his return to the United States Henson visited the old plantation\r\nin Montgomery County near Rockville, Maryland, finding his old\r\nmaster's wife still living. He then proceeded to Washington to see\r\nagain the old haunts which he frequented when serving as the market\r\nman of his plantation. While in the National Capital he went to the\r\nWhite House to call on his Excellency President Hayes, who chatted\r\nwith him about his trip across the sea while Mrs. Hayes showed\r\nHenson's wife through the executive mansion. When he left the\r\nPresident extended him a cordial invitation to call to see him again.\r\nThis was the last thing of note in his life. He returned to his home\r\nin Canada and resumed the best he could the work he was prosecuting,\r\nbut old age and sickness overtook him and he passed away in 1881 in\r\nthe ninety-second year of his life.\r\n\r\n                                   W. B. HARTGROVE\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] On account of ill health Mr. W. B. Hartgrove, who was preparing\r\nthis article, had to turn over his unfinished manuscript to the\r\neditor, who completed it. The story is based on the \"_Life of Josiah\r\nHenson_,\" \"_Father Henson's Story of His Own Life_\" and \"_Uncle Tom's\r\nStory of His Life_.\"--THE EDITOR.\r\n\r\n[2] Henson, \"_Uncle Tom's Story of his Life_,\" p. 15.\r\n\r\n[3] Henson, \"_Uncle Tom's own Story of his Life_,\" p. 53.\r\n\r\n[4] Henson gives this interesting conversation:\r\n\r\n\"How far is it to Canada?\" He gave me a peculiar look, and in a minute\r\nI saw he knew all. \"Want to go to Canada? Come along with us, then.\r\nOur captain's a fine fellow. We're going to Buffalo.\" \"Buffalo; how\r\nfar is that from Canada?\" \"Don't you know, man? Just across the\r\nriver.\" I now opened my mind frankly to him, and told him about my\r\nwife and children. \"I'll speak to the captain,\" said he. He did so,\r\nand in a moment the captain took me aside, and said, \"The Doctor says\r\nyou want to go to Buffalo with your family.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Well why not\r\ngo with me?\" was his frank reply. \"Doctor says you've got a family.\"\r\n\"Yes, sir.\" \"Where do you stop?\" \"About a mile back.\" \"How long have\r\nyou been here.\" \"No time,\" I answered, after a moment's hesitation.\r\n\"Come, my good fellow, tell us all about it. You're running away,\r\nain't you?\" Henson saw that he was a friend, and opened his heart to\r\nhim. \"How long will it take you to get ready?\" \"Be here in half an\r\nhour, sir.\" \"Well go along and get them.\" Off I started; but, before I\r\nhad run fifty feet, he called me back. \"Stop,\" said he; \"you go on\r\ngetting the grain in. When we get off, I'll lay to over opposite that\r\nisland, and send a boat back. There's a lot of regular nigger-catchers\r\nin the town below, and they might suspect if you brought your party\r\nout of the bush by daylight.\" I worked away with a will. Soon the two\r\nor three hundred bushels of corn were aboard, the hatches fastened\r\ndown, the anchor raised, and the sails hoisted. I watched the vessel\r\nwith intense interest as she left her moorings. Away she went before\r\nthe free breeze. Already she seemed beyond the spot at which the\r\ncaptain agreed to lay to, and still she flew along. My heart sank\r\nwithin me; so near deliverance, and again to have my hopes blasted,\r\nagain to be cast on my own resources. I felt that they had been making\r\na mock of my misery. The sun had sunk to rest, and the purple and gold\r\nof the west were fading away into gray. Suddenly, however, as I gazed\r\nwith weary heart the vessel swung round into the wind, the sails\r\nflapped, and she stood motionless. A moment more, and a boat was\r\nlowered from her stern, and with steady stroke made for the point at\r\nwhich I stood. I felt that my hour of release had come. On she came,\r\nand in ten minutes she rode up handsomely on the beach. My black\r\nfriend and two sailors jumped out, and we started on at once for my\r\nwife and children. To my horror, they were gone from the place where I\r\nleft them. Overpowered with fear, I supposed they had been found and\r\ncarried off. There was no time to lose, and the men told me I would\r\nhave to go alone. Just at the point of despair, however, I stumbled on\r\none of the children. My wife it seemed, alarmed at my long absence,\r\nhad given up all for lost, and supposed I had fallen into the hands of\r\nthe enemy. When she heard my voice, mingled with those of the others,\r\nshe thought my captors were leading me back to make me discover my\r\nfamily, and in the extremity of her terror she had tried to hide\r\nherself. I had hard work to satisfy her. Our long habits of\r\nconcealment and anxiety had rendered her suspicious of every one; and\r\nher agitation was so great that for a time she was incapable of\r\nunderstanding what I said, and went on in a sort of paroxysm of\r\ndistress and fear. This, however, was soon over, and the kindness of\r\nmy companions did much to facilitate the matter.\"--Father Henson's\r\nStory of his own Life, p. 121.\r\n\r\n[5] Henson, \"_Uncle Tom's Story of his Life_,\" p. 162.\r\n\r\n[6] Years thereafter when taking dinner with a distinguished gentleman\r\nin London the thought of enjoying such privileges while his only\r\nbrother was in slavery dawned suddenly and impressed itself so\r\nforcefully upon him that he immediately arose from the table, unable\r\nto eat. He soon returned to America and at once proceeded to devise\r\nmeans to free his brother. Mr. William Chaplain, of New York, had\r\nrepeatedly urged him to flee by way of the underground railroad, but\r\nhe was so demoralized and stultified by slavery that he would not make\r\nan effort. Mr. Chaplain made a second effort to induce him to escape\r\nbut he still refused. Henson finally arranged to sell the narrative of\r\nhis life to secure funds for his liberation. The book sold well in New\r\nEngland and the requisite four hundred dollars being raised his\r\nbrother was freed and enabled to join him in Canada.--Father Henson's\r\n_Story of his own Life_, pp. 209-212.\r\n\r\n[7] _Liberator_, April 11, 1851.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING AND THE NEGRO\r\n\r\n\r\nElizabeth Barrett Browning was a poetic artist who was intensely\r\nconcerned with the large human movements of the world and the age into\r\nwhich she was thrown. Her whole life was one great heart-throb. While\r\nthe condition of her health and the nature of her early training were\r\nsuch as to cultivate her rather bookish and romantic temperament, she\r\nfollowed with eagerness the great social reforms in England in the\r\nreign of William IV and the early years of Victoria; and _The Cry of\r\nthe Children_ and _The Cry of the Human_ indicated what was to be one\r\nof her chief lines of interest. In her later years she threw herself\r\nheart and soul into the cause of Italian independence and unity,\r\nwelcoming Napoleon III as a benefactor. Her political judgment was not\r\nalways sound: her distinguished husband could not possibly follow her\r\nin her admiration for Napoleon, whom he regarded as to some extent at\r\nleast a charlatan, and Cavour simply represented his countrymen in his\r\namazement and chagrin at the terms of the Peace of Villafranca;\r\nnevertheless the great heart of Elizabeth Barrett Browning was ever\r\nmoved by the demands of liberty, whether the immediate impulse was a\r\nchild in the sweatshops of England, an Italian wishing to be free of\r\nAustria, or the exiled Victor Hugo, and there was no exaggeration in\r\nthe tribute placed on the wall of Casa Guidi after her death:\r\n\r\n          Qui scrisse e mori\r\n     Elizabetta Barrett Browning\r\n   che in cuore di donna conciliava\r\n  scienza di dotto e spirito di poeta\r\n   e fece del suo verso aureo anello\r\n       fra Italia e Inghilterra\r\n          pone questa lapide\r\n            Firenze grata\r\n               1861[8]\r\n\r\nTo such a woman the Negro, held in slavery in a great free republic,\r\nmade a ready appeal. The first concrete connection, however, was one\r\ndirectly affecting the fortunes of the Barrett family. For some years\r\nMr. Barrett had made his home at a beautiful estate in Herefordshire\r\nknown as Hope End. He had inherited from his maternal grandfather a\r\nlarge estate in Jamaica, where the families of both his parents had\r\nbeen established for two or three generations. The abolition of\r\nslavery in the British colonies in 1833 inflicted great financial\r\nembarrassment upon him, as a result of which he was forced to sell\r\nHope End and to remove his family, first to Sidmouth in Devonshire,\r\nand subsequently to London. Elizabeth Barrett foreshadowed this change\r\nof fortunes in a letter to her friend Mrs. Martin dated Sidmouth, May\r\n27, 1833:\r\n\r\n     The West Indians are irreparably ruined if the Bill passes. Papa\r\n     says that in the case of its passing, nobody in his senses would\r\n     think of even attempting the culture of sugar, and that they had\r\n     better hang weights to the sides of the island of Jamaica and\r\n     sink it at once.[9]\r\n\r\nIn September of the same year she wrote from Sidmouth to the same\r\nfriend as follows:\r\n\r\n     Of course you know that the late Bill has ruined the West\r\n     Indians. That is settled. The consternation here is very great.\r\n     Nevertheless I am glad, and always shall be, that the Negroes\r\n     are--virtually--free.[10]\r\n\r\nIt is some years before we find another reference so definite. Miss\r\nBarrett in the meantime became Mrs. Browning and under the inspiration\r\nof love and Italy gave herself anew to her work. The feeling for\r\nliberty was constantly with her, as was to be seen from _Casa Guidi\r\nWindows_ and _Poems before Congress_. About 1855, when she was on a\r\nvisit to England, through the work of Daniel D. Home, a notorious\r\nAmerican exponent of spiritualism, Mrs. Browning became interested in\r\nthe current fad, and gave to it vastly more serious attention than\r\nmost other initiates. Browning himself, while patient, was intolerably\r\nirritated with those whom he regarded as imposing on his wife's\r\ncredulity, and delivered himself on the subject in _Mr. Sludge, 'the\r\nMedium_.' Spiritualism, however, was a topic of never-failing interest\r\nbetween Mrs. Browning and her American friend, Harriet Beecher Stowe,\r\nwhom she entertained in Italy. _Uncle Tom's Cabin_ made a profound\r\nimpression upon her. In 1853 this book was still in the great flush of\r\nits first success. On April 12, 1853, Mrs. Browning wrote from\r\nFlorence to Mrs. Jameson as follows:\r\n\r\n     Not read Mrs. Stowe's book! _But you must_. Her book is quite a\r\n     sign of the times, and has otherwise and intrinsically\r\n     considerable power. For myself, I rejoice in the success, both as\r\n     a woman and a human being. Oh, and is it possible that you think\r\n     a woman has no business with questions like the question of\r\n     slavery? Then she had better use a pen no more. She had better\r\n     subside into slavery and concubinage herself, I think, as in the\r\n     times of old, shut herself up with the Penelopes in the \"women's\r\n     apartment,\" and take no rank among thinkers and speakers.\r\n     Certainly you are not in earnest in these things. A difficult\r\n     question--yes! All virtue is difficult. England found it\r\n     difficult. France found it difficult. But we did not make\r\n     ourselves an armchair of our sins. As for America, I honor\r\n     America in much; but I would not be an American for the world\r\n     while she wears that shameful scar upon her brow. The address of\r\n     the new president[11] exasperates me. Observe, I am an\r\n     abolitionist, not to the fanatical degree, because I hold that\r\n     compensation should be given by the North to the South, as in\r\n     England. The states should unite in buying off this national\r\n     disgrace.[12]\r\n\r\nUnder date Florence, December 11, 1854, Mrs. Browning wrote to Miss\r\nMitford as follows:\r\n\r\n     I am reading now Mrs. Stowe's _Sunny Memories_, and like the\r\n     naturalness and simplicity of the book much, in spite of the\r\n     provincialism of the tone of mind and education, and the really\r\n     wretched writing. It's quite wonderful that a woman who has\r\n     written a book to make the world ring should write so\r\n     abominably.[13]\r\n\r\nMore and more as the Civil War approached was Mrs. Browning depressed\r\nby the thought of the impending conflict. Between June 7, 1860, and\r\nJuly 25, 1861, she contributed to the recently established\r\n_Independent_ eleven poems, chiefly on subjects of Italian liberty.\r\nSometimes, however, especially in the letters accompanying her poems,\r\nshe touched on themes somewhat closer to the American people. For the\r\nissue of March 21, 1861, she wrote to the editor as follows:\r\n\r\n     My partiality for frenzies is not so absorbing, believe me, as to\r\n     exclude very painful consideration on the dissolution of your\r\n     great Union. But my serious fear has been, and is, not for the\r\n     dissolution of the body but the death of the soul--not of a\r\n     rupture of states and civil war, but at reconciliation and peace\r\n     at the expense of a deadly compromise of principle. Nothing will\r\n     destroy the Republic but what corrupts its conscience and\r\n     disturbs its fame--for the stain upon the honor must come off\r\n     upon the flag. _If, on the other hand, the North stands fast on\r\n     the moral ground, no glory will be like your glory_.... What\r\n     surprises me is that the slaves don't rise.\r\n\r\nOn this great subject Mrs. Browning found her husband in full sympathy\r\nwith her. Browning himself declared in a letter to an American,\r\nSeptember 11, 1861:\r\n\r\n     I have lost the explanation of American affairs, but I assure you\r\n     of my belief in the justice and my confidence in the triumph of\r\n     the great cause. For the righteousness of the principle I want no\r\n     information. God prosper it and its defenders.[14]\r\n\r\nTwo poems by Mrs. Browning at least have to do directly with the Negro\r\nand American affairs. One was _A Curse for a Nation_ contributed to\r\nthe _Poems before Congress_ volume. The poet begins somewhat\r\nself-consciously:\r\n\r\n    I heard an angel speak last night,\r\n            And he said \"Write!\r\n    Write a Nation's curse for me,\r\n    And send it over the Western Sea.\"\r\n\r\nShe protests her unwillingness to execute such a commission, for, she\r\nsays,\r\n\r\n    I am bound by gratitude\r\n            By love and blood,\r\n    To brothers of mine across the sea,\r\n    Who stretch out kindly hands to me.\r\n\r\nThe angel, however, beats down this unwillingness and the curse\r\nfollows, the second stanza reading:\r\n\r\n    Because yourselves are standing straight\r\n      In the state\r\n    Of Freedom's foremost acolyte,\r\n    Yet keep calm footing all the time\r\n    On writhing bond-slaves,--for this crime\r\n      This is the curse. Write.\r\n\r\nAt best, however, _A Curse for a Nation_ can hardly help impressing\r\none as a little forced. In rather higher poetic vein is the other\r\npoem, _The Runaway Slave at Pilgrim's Point_. This was contributed to\r\n_The Liberty Bell_, a publication issued by the Boston Anti-Slavery\r\nBazar in 1848. Mrs. Browning feared that the poem might be \"too\r\nferocious for the Americans to publish.\" The composition is\r\nundoubtedly a strong one. It undertakes to give the story of a young\r\nNegro woman who was bound in slavery, whose lover was crushed before\r\nher face, who was forced to submit to personal violation, who killed\r\nher child that so much reminded her of her white master's face, and\r\nwho at last at Pilgrim's Point defied her pursuers. With unusual\r\nearnestness the poet has entered sympathetically into the subject. The\r\nfollowing stanzas are typical:\r\n\r\n    But _we_ who are dark, we are dark\r\n     Ah God, we have no stars!\r\n    About our souls in care and cark\r\n     Our blackness shuts like prison-bars;\r\n    The poor souls crouch so far behind\r\n    That never a comfort can they find\r\n     By reaching through the prison-bars.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Why, in that single glance I had\r\n     Of my child's face, ... I tell you all,\r\n    I saw a look that made me mad\r\n     The _master's_ look, that used to fall\r\n    On my soul like his lash ... or worse\r\n    And so, to save it from my curse,\r\n     I twisted it round in my shawl.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    From the white man's house, and the black man's hut,\r\n     I carried the little body on;\r\n    The forest's arm did round us shut,\r\n     And silence through the trees did run:\r\n    They asked no question as I went,\r\n    They stood too high for astonishment,\r\n     They could see God sit on his throne.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    (Man, drop that stone you dared to lift!--)\r\n     I wish you who stand there five abreast,\r\n    Each, for his own wife's joy and gift,\r\n     A little corpse as safely at rest\r\n    As mine in the mangoes: Yes, but _she_\r\n    My keep live babies on her knee,\r\n     And sing the song she likes the best.\r\n\r\nIn such a review as this of the connections between Mrs. Browning and\r\nthe Negro one can not help coming face to face with the question\r\nwhether her famous husband was not himself connected by blood with the\r\nNegro race. The strain is hardly so pronounced as in men like\r\nAlexandre Dumas or Leigh Hunt, and as in the case of Alexander\r\nHamilton, the point still seems to be waiting for final proof. The\r\nassertion is persistent, however, and there can be little doubt that\r\nsuch is the case. The standard life of Browning,[15] after wrestling\r\nin vain with the problem, dismisses it as follows:\r\n\r\n     Dr. Furnivall has originated a theory, and maintains it as a\r\n     conviction, that Mr. Browning's grandmother was more than a\r\n     Creole in the strict sense of the term, that of a person born of\r\n     white parents in the West Indies, and that an unmistakable dash\r\n     of dark blood passed from her to her son and grandson. Such an\r\n     occurrence was, on the face of it, not impossible, and would be\r\n     absolutely unimportant to my mind, and, I think I may add, to\r\n     that of Mr. Browning's sister and son. The poet and his father\r\n     were what we know them, and if Negro blood had any part in their\r\n     composition, it was no worse for them, and so much the better for\r\n     the Negro.\r\n\r\nAside from this last point, from the evidence that has been given,\r\nwhile this of course has its limitations, we may safely assert that\r\nwith her large humanity and her enthusiasm for liberty, Elizabeth\r\nBarrett Browning was one of the sturdiest defenders in England of the\r\ncause of the American Negro at the time of the beginning of the Civil\r\nWar. It is to be regretted that she did not live to read the\r\nEmancipation Proclamation and to see the Negro started on an era of\r\nself-reliance and progress.\r\n\r\n                                   BENJAMIN BRAWLEY\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8] For the inscription we are indebted to the Cambridge edition of\r\nthe poems of Mrs. Browning, edited by Harriet Waters Preston, Houghton\r\nMifflin, Boston, p. xii.

When the\r\nbeleaguered inhabitants could no longer maintain themselves, owing to\r\nthe shortage of food supplies, they burned the city, and those who\r\nwere not killed in battle with the Romans committed suicide. Scipio\r\nAEmilianus, the Roman leader, entered Numantia to find nothing but\r\nburning embers and piles of corpses.\r\n\r\nThis incident has an almost exact parallel in the history of\r\nBrazil--only this time the heroes were Negroes, defending the capital\r\nof one of the earliest and one of the strangest Negro republics in the\r\nhistory of the world. The Portuguese, who were the first to introduce\r\nNegro slavery into Europe, did not long delay in carrying the\r\ninstitution to their colony of Brazil. It was in 1574 that the first\r\nslave ship reached there. Thereafter, great numbers of Negroes were\r\nbrought, especially to northern Brazil, in the equatorial belt, to\r\nwork in the profitable sugar fields. No region of the Americas was so\r\naccessible to the slave trade, for the Brazilian coast juts out into\r\nthe Atlantic Ocean directly opposite the Gulf of Guinea in Africa,\r\nwhence most of the slaves were procured. It is profitless here to go\r\ninto the question of the treatment of the slaves by their Portuguese\r\nmasters. Some were badly treated, and took the chance of flight to the\r\ninterior forest lands, rather than submit any longer. Various causes\r\nprompted yet others to escape from the colonial plantations. Thus many\r\na _quilombo_, or Negro village of the forest, was formed. By far the\r\nmost famous of these was the _quilombo_ of Palmares, whose history is\r\nthe subject of this article.\r\n\r\nIn 1650, forty determined Negroes of the province of Pernambuco, all\r\nof them natives of Guinea, rose against their masters, taking as much\r\nas they could in the way of arms and provisions, and fled to the\r\nneighboring forest. There they founded a _quilombo_ on the site of a\r\nwell-known Negro village of earlier days, which the Dutch had\r\ndestroyed. The tale of their escape was told throughout the province,\r\nwith the result that it was not long before the population of the new\r\n_quilombo_ was greatly increased. Slaves and freemen were eager to\r\njoin their brethren in the forest. It seemed prudent, however, to go\r\nfarther away from the white settlements, lest the very strength of the\r\nNegro town should invite annihilation or re-enslavement by the\r\nplanters. Thus it was that the inland site of Palmares, not far from\r\npresent-day Anadia, was chosen. A town was founded, and all seemed\r\nwell except for one thing--an essential to permanence was lacking, for\r\nthere were no women. A detachment of Negroes was sent on the romantic\r\nmission of procuring wives for the colony. This party marched to the\r\nnearest plantations, and, without stopping to discriminate, took all\r\nthe women it could find, black, mulatto, and white. Palmares was now\r\non a secure footing indeed.\r\n\r\nAt first, the inhabitants lived by a species of banditry, robbing the\r\nwhites whenever they could. Gradually, a more settled type of life\r\ndeveloped. The Negroes began to engage in agriculture, and at length\r\nentered into something approximating peaceful relations with the\r\nPortuguese settlements. Trade took the place of warfare, although fear\r\nof the overgrown _quilombo_ was perhaps as much the motive on the part\r\nof the whites as the desire for profits. A rustic republic of an\r\nadmirable type was formed for the maintenance of internal order and\r\nexternal safety. Combining republican and monarchical features, they\r\nelected a chief, or king, called the _Zombe_, who ruled with absolute\r\nauthority during the term of his life. The right of candidacy was\r\nrestricted to a group recognized as composing the bravest men of the\r\ncommunity. Any man in the state might aspire to this dignity, provided\r\nhe had Negro blood in his veins. There were other officials, both of a\r\nmilitary and of a civil character. In the interests of good order,\r\nthe _Zombes_ made laws imposing the death penalty for murder,\r\nadultery, and robbery. Slavery existed, and in this respect there was\r\na curious custom. Every Negro who had won his freedom from the white\r\nman, by whatever method, as for example by a successful flight to\r\nPalmares, remained a free man. Those who were captured while in a\r\nstate of slavery, however, became slaves in Palmares. Thus the reward\r\nof freedom was offered to those who should escape from the planters,\r\nand a punishment was held out to those who would not, or could not, do\r\nso. In course of time, the Negro republic expanded until it included a\r\nnumber of towns. Palmares alone is said to have had a population of\r\n20,000, and the number of fighting men in the whole republic was some\r\n10,000. The capital city, Palmares, was surrounded by wooden walls,\r\nmade of the trunks of large trees. The city was entered by means of\r\nthree huge gates, on the tops of which were great platforms, always\r\nwell guarded.\r\n\r\nFor nearly half a century the little republic prospered. It was\r\nperhaps only natural that the Portuguese settlers should wish to\r\ndestroy it, for it represented an alien force and an ever present\r\ndanger, certainly so far as their profits from the use of slave labor\r\nwent. At any rate, in the year 1696, Governor Caetano de Mello of\r\nPernambuco decided upon an expedition against Palmares. A strong force\r\nwas sent, but it was met by the Negroes and totally defeated. A\r\nveritable army of some 7,000 men was now gathered, and placed under\r\nthe command of a competent soldier named Bernardo Vieira. This time,\r\nthe Portuguese troops were well provided with artillery, with which\r\nthe Negro republic could not be expected to cope. Palmares was\r\nreached, but it was in no mood for surrender, and it was necessary to\r\nbegin a regular siege of the city. The defence was desperate. After\r\nthe Portuguese artillery had breached the walls in three places, their\r\ninfantry attacked in force. They entered the city, but had to take it,\r\nfoot by foot. At last, the defenders came to the center of Palmares,\r\nwhere a high cliff impeded further retreat. Death or surrender were\r\nnow the only alternatives. Seeing that his cause was lost beyond\r\nrepair, the _Zombe_ hurled himself over the cliff, and his action was\r\nfollowed by the most distinguished of his fighting men. Some prisoners\r\nwere indeed taken, but it is perhaps a tribute to Palmares, though a\r\ngruesome one, that they were all put to death; it was not safe to\r\nenslave these men, despite the value of their labor. Thus passed\r\nPalmares, the Negro Numantia, most famous and greatest of the\r\nBrazilian _qui-lombos_.\r\n\r\n                                     CHARLES E. CHAPMAN\r\n\r\n  ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF HISTORY, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSLAVERY IN CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n\r\nSlavery in California prior to the Mexican War was slavery in the\r\nSpanish possessions. The Spaniards began with the enslavement of\r\nIndians and later at the advice of De las Casas changed to that of\r\nNegroes.[16] This system was first used in the West Indies and later\r\nextended to other colonies. It is said that about the year 1537,\r\nCortes fitted out at the port of Tehuantepec, several small vessels,\r\nprovided with everything required for planting a colony and sailed\r\nnorth to the head of the Gulf of California, transporting four hundred\r\nSpaniards and three hundred Negro slaves, that he had assembled for\r\nthat purpose.[17] This is the first mention of Negro slavery in\r\nCalifornia. After the founding of the Mission of San Carlos by the\r\npresident, Father Junipero Serra, with a community of twenty-three\r\nfriars, we read that the first interment in the cemetery was that of\r\nIgnacio Ramirez, a former mulatto slave from San Antonio, who had\r\nmoney to purchase his freedom.[18] There were too a number of Negro\r\nslaves brought to California between these periods. They came on\r\ntrading ships and with various expeditions, which they usually\r\ndeserted after reaching the State. Hittell is wrong, therefore, in\r\nsaying that the first slave in California was brought there in 1825\r\nwhen the wife of Antonio Jose de Cot, a Spaniard, brought with her a\r\nslave girl named Juana, fourteen years of age, from Lima to San\r\nFrancisco. He doubted even that this was the first slave in California\r\nfor the lady expressed her intention to avail herself of the first\r\nopportunity to leave.[19]\r\n\r\nSpain did not especially bother about Negro slavery in her Pacific\r\ncoast territory for nearly two hundred years before the coming of the\r\nAmericans. She promised by the treaty of September 30, 1817, to\r\nabolish the slave trade October 31, 1820, in all Spanish territory. In\r\n1821, however, certain of the northern colonies of Spain in America\r\nestablished their independence as the United States of Mexico.[5]\r\nThree years later the importation of slaves from foreign countries was\r\nprohibited and children of slave parents were declared free.\r\nNotwithstanding this there set in considerable emigration from the\r\nSouthern States followed by an agitation for the acquisition of Texas.\r\nIn 1827, therefore, Coahuila and Texas were organized as a State with\r\na law prohibiting slavery. As this, however, did not check the\r\nimmigration, President Guerro issued a decree[20] in 1829 abolishing\r\nslavery in Mexico on the occasion of the celebration of the\r\nindependence of Mexico and in 1830 ordered a military occupation of\r\nthe State to enforce the anti-slavery measure.[4] But the aggressive\r\nsoutherner ever endeavoring to extend the territory of slavery had all\r\nbut won the day in Texas. In 1836 Texas declared itself a republic\r\nwith a constitution permitting the introduction of slavery and\r\nforbidding the residence of free Negroes without the consent of its\r\nCongress. Then came the Mexican War resulting in the defeat of Mexico\r\nand the cession to the United States of a vast territory of which\r\nCalifornia was the most valuable part.\r\n\r\nIt is clear, therefore, that at the time the United States government\r\nacquired the territory of California from Mexico, slavery had been\r\nabolished there nearly twenty years. The pro-slavery party, however,\r\ndid not consider this action of Mexico a finality in the settlement of\r\nthe slavery question in the new possessions. When a bill providing for\r\nthe purchase of this territory was laid before the house, David\r\nWilmot, of Pennsylvania, after consultation with other northern\r\ndemocrats, offered the following amendment:\r\n\r\n     \"Provided that an express and fundamental condition to the\r\n     acquisition of any territory from the republic of Mexico by the\r\n     United States, by virtue of any treaty which may be negotiated\r\n     between them, and to the use by the executive of the moneys\r\n     herein appropriated, neither slavery nor involuntary servitude\r\n     shall ever exist in any part of said territory, except for crime\r\n     whereof the party shall first be duly convicted.\"[21]\r\n\r\nThis proviso was adopted by a vote of 83 to 64. The bill carrying this\r\nproviso was then reported to the Senate where followed a heated debate\r\nwhich lasted until adjournment, the proviso being killed in the midst\r\nof stormy scenes in Congress.[22] This discussion showed that few\r\nstatesmen believed that slavery would be profitable in California.\r\nThey were not unlike Daniel Webster who, while speaking on the\r\nadmission of the State of Texas, said that slavery was effectually\r\nexcluded from California and New Mexico by a law even superior to that\r\nwhich admits and sanctions it in Texas. He meant the law of nature.\r\nThe physiographic conditions of the country would forever exclude\r\nAfrican slavery there; and it needed not the application of a proviso.\r\nIf the question was then before the Senate he would not vote \"to add a\r\nprohibition--to reaffirm an ordinance of nature, nor reenact the will\r\nof God.\"[23]\r\n\r\nThe coming and going of the Negro in California did not especially\r\ninterest any one until the beginning of the immigration of the\r\nforties. The subject of slavery in California was officially called to\r\nthe attention of the inhabitants through the issuance of a\r\nproclamation by the Commander in Chief of the District in regard to\r\nthe unlawful enslaving of the Indians. He was endeavoring to protect\r\nthem, but they were enslaved[24] in spite of his efforts. The\r\nlegislature undertook to perpetuate this system by enacting a law\r\npermitting the enslavement of Indians, the only condition upon the\r\nmaster being a bond of a small sum, that he would not abuse or cruelly\r\ntreat the slaves. Under the provision of the same law, Indians could\r\nbe arrested as vagrants and sold to the highest bidder within\r\ntwenty-four hours after the arrest, and the buyer had the privilege of\r\nthe labor for a period not exceeding four months.[25] An Indian\r\narrested for a violation of a law could demand a jury trial, but could\r\nnot testify in his own behalf against a white person. If found guilty\r\nof any crime, he could either be imprisoned or whipped, the whipping\r\nnot to exceed twenty-four lashes.[26]\r\n\r\nLater there was a steady influx of southerners and their Negro slaves\r\ninto the territory of California, after the country was taken over by\r\nthe United States. Then came the question as to the enslavement of the\r\nNegro. The situation became serious after the Congress of the United\r\nStates appropriated three millions of dollars for the purchase of the\r\nnew territory, and still more so after gold was discovered there.\r\nMexican rule ended with the cession of the territory to the United\r\nStates; and yet session after session of Congress adjourned without\r\ngiving California a territorial form of government. The question of\r\nslavery in the newly acquired territory divided Congress so that they\r\ncould not decide the issue. Southern newspapers were advertising for\r\nslave-owners to send names and the number of slaves they were taking\r\nto California to found a _New Colony_.[27]\r\n\r\nThe settlers were divided. Some came because they either disliked\r\nslavery, or were too poor to own slaves. They recognized the\r\npossibilities for making California a free State and did not care to\r\nbe designated _Poor White Trash_ by masters who were being allowed to\r\nfill the State with Negro slaves to constitute the basis of an\r\naristocracy like that in the South. There were other inhabitants in\r\nCalifornia at the time who, being slave-owners, were southern\r\nsympathizers. They were determined either to have slavery in\r\nCalifornia or make a desperate effort before seeing the territory\r\ngiven up as a free State.[28] It did not require very much\r\ninvestigation, however, to show that the pro-slavery party was in the\r\nminority. The editor of the _Californian_ said in May, 1848, that he\r\nvoiced the sentiments of the people in California in saying that\r\nslavery was neither needed nor desired there. A correspondent of this\r\npaper hoping to hold that section for free labor said: \"If white labor\r\nis too high for agriculture, laborers on contract may be brought from\r\nChina.\" Referring to the proposal to make the commonwealth a slave\r\nState Buckelew said: \"We have not heard one of our acquaintance in\r\nthis country advocate this measure and we are almost certain that\r\n97-100 of the present population are opposed to it.\" Again it is\r\nremarked in this paper: \"We left the slave states because we did not\r\nlike to bring up a family in a miserable, can't-help-one's-self\r\ncondition,\" and dearly as he loved the union, he would prefer\r\nCalifornia independent to seeing her a slave State.[29]\r\n\r\nThe lack of law and order and fear of the southern slave-owners with\r\ntheir herds of Negro slaves finally led to the call of the\r\nConstitutional Convention. The question of slavery there was not so\r\nmuch debated in that body as was expected. Some excited pro-slavery\r\nleaders were talking of an independent _Pacific Republic_. The\r\nsouthern faction in the convention was led by a Mr. Gwyn, who\r\nafterwards became a United States Senator from California, and the\r\nnorthern element was ably represented by a Mr. Broderick, who later\r\nwas chosen State Senator.[30] The convention finally drafted their\r\nconstitution with a section which provided that \"neither slavery nor\r\ninvoluntary servitude unless for the punishment of crime shall ever be\r\ntolerated in this state.\"\r\n\r\nThe pro-slavery faction in the convention was determined to have\r\nslavery somewhere and had managed to have the eastern boundary of\r\nCalifornia so designated that it extended as far as the Rocky\r\nMountains. This would have resulted in rejection by Congress, or a\r\ndivision of the territory into a Northern and a Southern California,\r\ngiving the pro-slavery element a new State. The unwieldy boundary,\r\nhowever, was discovered in time to have it changed, but not until\r\nafter much debate, which almost wrecked the constitution. The\r\nCalifornia representatives elected by the convention left for\r\nWashington, where they presented to Congress the constitution and the\r\npetition of the California settlers asking for admission as a State.\r\nThere had never been a precedent for their act. Yet the settlers in\r\nCalifornia felt perfectly justified, since it was their only safeguard\r\nagainst the pro-slavery leaders who were bringing their slaves into\r\nthe territory.\r\n\r\nLeaders at the national capital naturally hesitated, not knowing\r\nwhether or not the admission of California under the conditions thus\r\nobtaining would aggravate or improve the national situation.\r\nCalifornia, however, cared little about the national situation, as is\r\nattested by the resolutions of 1850 to the effect: \"That any attempts\r\nby congress to interfere with the institution of slavery in any of the\r\nterritories of the United States would create just grounds of alarm\r\nin many of the States of the union; and that such interference is\r\nunnecessary, inexpedient, and in violation of good faith; since, when\r\nany such territory applies for admission into the union as a state,\r\nthe people thereof alone have the right, and should be left free and\r\nunrestrained, to decide such question for themselves.\" Broderick moved\r\nthe insertion of the following: \"That opposition to the admission of a\r\nstate into the union with a constitution prohibiting slavery, on\r\naccount of such prohibition, is a policy wholly unjustifiable and\r\nunstatesmanlike, and in violation of that spirit of concession and\r\ncompromise by which alone the federal constitution was adopted, and by\r\nwhich alone it can be perpetuated.\" This amendment was adopted.[31]\r\n\r\nAfter a debate of four months Congress admitted California as a free\r\nState as one of five compromises. Jefferson Davis, however, repudiated\r\nthe idea of advantage to his section. He said: \"Where is the\r\nconcession to the South? Is it in the admission, as a state, of\r\nCalifornia, from which we have been excluded by congressional\r\nagitation? Is it in the announcement that slavery does not and is not\r\nto exist in the remaining territories of New Mexico and California? Is\r\nit in denying the title of Texas to one half of her territory?\" He\r\nheld that gold washing and mining was particularly adapted to slave\r\nlabor, as was agriculture that depended on irrigation.[32] The day\r\nafter the admission certain southern senators sent to that body a\r\n_Protest_ against the injustice of the act of Congress, admitting\r\nCalifornia as a free State. The Senate refused the clerk permission\r\neither to read or record it. Whereupon the newspapers began publishing\r\narticles of severe criticism and talked of dividing the Union.\r\nJefferson Davis went before the United States Senate and, addressing\r\nit, called attention to these comments, adding that so much outside\r\ncriticism was doing more to divide the Union than the _Protest_ would\r\npossibly do. Congress finally voted that the _Protest_ be\r\nrecorded.[33]\r\n\r\nWas this to be a free State in every sense of the word? This was\r\nthe day when the slave power \"was covertly grasping at the\r\nSpanish-speaking countries beyond the Rio Grande, as it had at the\r\nlands beyond the Sabine.\"[34] At first, it was not, for a good many\r\nslaves were brought into the State. On April 1, 1850, an advertisement\r\nappeared in the _Jackson Mississippian_ referring to _California, the\r\nSouthern Slave Colony_ and inviting citizens of slave-holding States,\r\nwishing to go to California, to send their names, number of slaves,\r\ntime of contemplated departure, etc., to the _Southern Slave Colony_,\r\nof Jackson, Mississippi. The design was to settle in the richest parts\r\nof the State and to secure an uninterrupted enjoyment of slave\r\nproperty. The colony was to comprise about 5,000 white persons and\r\n10,000 slaves.\r\n\r\nAnother effort to extend slavery in this section came in the\r\nunsuccessful filibustering expedition of the Tennessee lawyer, William\r\nWalker, who undertook to establish to the south in Sonora, a State\r\nwith a constitution like that of Louisiana, basing his advocacy of\r\nslavery on the lofty grounds of civilizing the blacks and liberating\r\nthe whites from manual labor. To explain the meaning of this\r\nexpedition Bancroft considers it sufficient to point out that\r\nJefferson Davis was Secretary of War at that time and that the Gadsden\r\npurchase was then under consideration.[35] In 1852 Peachy of San\r\nJoaquin introduced a resolution to allow fifty southern families to\r\nimmigrate into California with their slaves. Some of them came without\r\npermission but on finding that they could not legally hold their\r\nslaves, they sent a part of them back while others became free.\r\n\r\nIn 1852 the Legislature passed a rigid Fugitive Slave Law intending to\r\nbar slavery from the State. The mischievous clause of this measure was\r\nthat all slaves who had escaped into or were brought to California\r\nprevious to the admission of the State to the Union were held to be\r\nfugitives, and were liable to arrest under the law, although many of\r\nthem had been in the State several years, during which they had\r\naccumulated considerable property. The pro-slavery element not only\r\nprofited by this, but the interpretation of this law by many of the\r\nJudges enabled them to bring their slaves into the State, work them in\r\nthe mines, and return to the south and back to slavery with their\r\nNegroes.[36]\r\n\r\nIf they did not wish the trouble of their return passage they\r\nauctioned them off to the highest bidder. It also enabled them to\r\nmake fortunes by selling to the slaves their freedom, charging them\r\ntwice and often thrice the price he could have possibly brought on the\r\nother side of the Rocky Mountains.[37] In certain southern counties of\r\nthe State it was unpopular to speak in behalf of the slaves. In 1855\r\nChase and Day, two Abolitionists of Alameda County, were ridden on a\r\nrail, ducked and otherwise maltreated.[38] That same year expired the\r\nFugitive Slave Law which had been renewed from year to year to enable\r\nslave-owners to reclaim fugitives who had sought refuge in that State\r\nprior to its admission to the Union. Fearing that this might be\r\nfollowed by other legislation hostile to their class, the Negroes held\r\na convention in San Francisco that year to discuss their rights, their\r\ntreatment by the white people, politics, principles and necessity of\r\neducation. The Fugitive Slave Law was not reenacted.\r\n\r\nMany slaves, however, asserted their rights. Such was the case of\r\nArchy, a slave brought by one Charles A. Stoval from Mississippi to\r\nCalifornia in 1857. After hiring Archy out for some time Stoval\r\nundertook to return him to Mississippi. Archy escaped and was arrested\r\nas a fugitive. Stoval sued out a writ of habeas corpus for his\r\npossession and the case came before the Supreme Court for\r\nadjudication. Peter Burnett, formerly Governor, who had been appointed\r\njustice of that court by Governor Johnson in 1857 and filled the\r\noffice until 1858, presided. As Burnett was a southern man, his\r\ndecision was foreshadowed. He decided that although Stoval could not\r\nsustain the character of either a transient traveler or a visitor and\r\nunder the general law was not entitled to Archy, but he yet held that\r\nthere were circumstances connected with the particular case that might\r\nexempt him from the operation of the rules laid down. One of the\r\ncircumstances was that Stoval was traveling for his health; another,\r\nthat he was short of means upon arrival in California; and still\r\nanother, that this was the first case of the kind. He, therefore,\r\nordered Archy to be turned over to Stoval. Joseph G. Baldwin, who\r\nsucceeded Burnett, characterized the decision as \"giving the law to\r\nthe North and the Negro to the South.\"[39] After being delivered to\r\nStoval, Archy was taken to San Francisco, but his friends there sued\r\nout a writ of habeas corpus for his liberation before Judge Thomas W.\r\nFreelon, of the County of San Francisco. While this case was pending,\r\nhowever, Stoval swore to a new affidavit that Archy escaped from him\r\nin Mississippi and procured a warrant from George Pen Johnston, United\r\nStates Commissioner, for his arrest as a fugitive slave from\r\nMississippi. Archy was then discharged by Judge Freelon. He was\r\nimmediately rearrested and taken before George Pen Johnston, who\r\ndecided that Archy was in no sense a fugitive from Mississippi and\r\ndischarged him.[40]\r\n\r\nThe tendency to free the Negroes brought there checked the importation\r\nof that class. The rights of the master to his slave, however, were\r\nnot easily relinquished and the institution of slavery in California\r\ndid not come to an end until 1872. Freedom, however, had to win and\r\nthe pro-slavery element had to change its policy. In 1856 and 1857\r\nefforts were made to call a convention to change the constitution so\r\nas to permit the importation of slaves, for with the expiration of the\r\nFugitive Slave Law in 1855, slave-owners who held minors had to return\r\nthem to slave States or let them go free. Since the Negroes brought\r\ninto the State could in most cases become free the pro-slavery party\r\nthen sought to get rid of the free Negro.\r\n\r\nIn his message to the legislature in 1850, Governor Burnett\r\nrecommended the exclusion of free Negroes. This was always Burnett's\r\nhobby. He incorporated this into the laws of Oregon when he revised\r\nthem in 1844. Burnett had been brought up in the South and although he\r\nhad ceased to be a slaveholder, he could not think of living with\r\nNegroes as freemen. The exclusion of the blacks too had a sort of\r\npopular appeal in it. The legislature, however, was divided on the\r\nquestion as to what should be done with the free Negro. A bill in\r\ncompliance with the wishes of the Governor was introduced but\r\ndefeated. Undaunted by this, however, the enemy of the free Negroes\r\nwon a victory in another quarter in enacting a law that no black or\r\nmulatto person or Indian should be permitted to give evidence in any\r\naction to which a white person was a party. The leaders of the Negroes\r\nheld another convention in 1856 to protest against this law. Another\r\nbill providing for the prohibition of the immigration of free persons\r\nof color into the State was introduced in 1858 and after much debate\r\nput through both houses, but it never became a law. The black code, of\r\ncourse, was abrogated after the Civil War.\r\n\r\n                                   DELILAH L.

An owner of\r\nslaves in Mississippi brought them voluntarily into California before\r\nthe adoption of the Constitution by the State. The slaves asserted\r\ntheir freedom and for some months were engaged in business for\r\nthemselves. The owner under the provision of the Fugitive Slave Act of\r\n1852 brought them before the Justice of Peace, who allowed the claim\r\nof the owners and ordered them into his custody. The slaves then\r\npetitioned for a writ of habeas corpus which came before the Supreme.\r\nCourt and after hearing the case the Court ordered that the writ be\r\ndismissed and the slaves remanded to their owners.--_California\r\nReports_, II, 424-426.\r\n\r\nThe case of Alvin Coffey is equally as interesting. This account was\r\ngiven by a lifelong friend of the subject.\r\n\r\nAlvin Coffey was born in 1822, in Saint Louis, Missouri. He came to\r\nCalifornia with his sick master, a Mr. Duvall, who landed in San\r\nFrancisco, September 1, 1849. They went to Sacramento, October 13,\r\n1849. During the next eight months the slave earned for his master\r\n$5,000, working in the mines, and by washing for the miners and mining\r\nfor himself after night, he earned $700 of his own. As the master\r\ncontinued in poor health he decided to return with Alvin to Missouri\r\nat the expiration of two years. When they reached Kansas City,\r\nMissouri, the master sold Alvin to Nelson Tindle, first taking from\r\nhim the $5,000, earned for the master, and also the $700 earned for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nNelson Tindle took a great liking to Alvin and in a short time made\r\nhim overseer over a number of slaves. Alvin, however, longed to return\r\nto California and, in order to earn his freedom, bought his time from\r\nhis master and took contracts to build railroads. One day Nelson\r\nTindle said to Alvin that he was too smart a man to be a slave and\r\nought to try and purchase his freedom. Whereupon Alvin told him if he\r\nwould let him return to California, he could easily earn enough money\r\nto effect the purchase. Alvin was permitted to return to California,\r\nand in a short time sent his master the $1,500 to pay for his freedom.\r\nAlvin then undertook to earn the money to pay for the freedom of his\r\nwife and daughters, who were slaves of Doctor Bassett, of Missouri. He\r\nearned the required sum and returned for his family. After paying for\r\ntheir freedom, he went with them to Canada, where he left his\r\ndaughters to be educated. He and his wife Mahalia came to California.\r\nIt cost him for the freedom of himself and family together with the\r\ntrips to and from California about $7000. See Bancroft, \"_History of\r\nCalifornia_,\" VI, p. 382.\r\n\r\n[37] Some of these cases are more than interesting. Daniel Rodgers\r\ncame across the plains with his master from Little Rock, Arkansas,\r\nworked in the mines in Sonora, California, during the day for his\r\nmaster and at night for himself, earning and paying his master $1,100\r\nfor his freedom. Soon afterward the master returned with him to Little\r\nRock and sold him. A number of the leading white gentlemen of Little\r\nRock raised a sum of money, paid for his freedom and set him free.\r\nWilliam Pollock and wife from North Carolina came to California with\r\ntheir master who located at Cold Springs, Coloma, California. He paid\r\n$1,000 for himself and $800 for his wife. The money was earned by\r\nwashing for the miners at night and making doughnuts. They removed to\r\nPlacerville, California, and afterward earned their living as\r\ncaterers. In 1849, a slaveholder brought his slave to California. Not\r\nwishing to take the Negro back to his native State, Alabama, he\r\nconcluded to sell him by auction. An advertisement was put in the\r\npapers, the boy was purchased for $1,000, by Caleb T. Fay, a strong\r\nabolitionist, who gave the boy his freedom.\r\n\r\nA Mississippi slaveholder brought several slaves from that State and\r\npromised to give them their freedom in two years. They all ran away\r\nsave one, Charles Bates, when they learned that they were already\r\nfree. The owner, finding mining did not pay, started east, taking\r\nCharles with him. On the Isthmus of Panama, Charles was persuaded to\r\nleave his master. He returned to California and to Stockton with his\r\ntrue friend. On the street one day he was recognized by a party who\r\nhad lent money to Charles's master. The debtor got out an attachment\r\nfor the former slave as chattel property, and according to the State\r\nlaw, the Negro was put up and sold at auction. A number of\r\nanti-slavery men bought the boy for $750 and gave him his\r\nfreedom.--_California Reports_, I, 424-426.\r\n\r\n[38] Bancroft, \"_History of California_,\" VI, p. 716.\r\n\r\n[39] Bancroft, \"_History of California_,\" VI, p. 716.\r\n\r\n[40] _Ibid._, VI, p. 716.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOCUMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nCALIFORNIA FREEDOM PAPERS[41]\r\n\r\nTo determine the sources of the Negroes first brought into California\r\ntheir treatment by the whites and the methods employed to obtain their\r\nfreedom no documents are more valuable than the manumission papers\r\nfound in the archives of that State.

And whereas it appears to me that the second party\r\n     in this agreement has obtained this boy in a lawful manner\r\n     without fraud or oppression and that the boy \"Smoky\" therefore\r\n     comes justly under the first provision of the law providing for\r\n     apprenticeship approved April, 8th A.D. 1860.\r\n\r\n     Now therefore I, A. J. Houstis, County Judge Aforesaid, in\r\n     consideration of the premises and acting for and on behalf of the\r\n     said Indian boy \"Smoky\" do by these presents bind and apprentice\r\n     as above stated the said boy \"Smoky\" to Austin Wiley for and\r\n     during the term of seventeen years next following this indenture\r\n     entitling him according to law to have the care custody, control\r\n     and earnings of said boy during said period and all other\r\n     advantages and responsibilities growing out of this indenture and\r\n     apprenticeship, that the law contemplates. And the said Austin\r\n     Wiley, the second part in his agreement doth hereby agree,\r\n     obligate and bind himself that he will truly and faithfully\r\n     discharge all obligations on his part growing out of this\r\n     indenture according to law. That he will suitably clothe and\r\n     provide the necessaries of life for the said boy during his term\r\n     of indenture. That he will in all respects treat him in a human\r\n     manner. That he will not take him out of this state nor transfer\r\n     him to any party not known in this agreement without the consent\r\n     of legal authorities endorsed thereon and that in all respects\r\n     she will carry out every provision of law that contemplates the\r\n     safety, protection and well being of said boy.\r\n\r\n     In witness whereof the parties of this indenture hereunto set\r\n     their hand and seal this date first above written.\r\n\r\n                                   A.J.HOUSTIS\r\n                                       _County Judge_\r\n                                           First party\r\n                                   AUSTIN WILEY,\r\n                                       Second party\r\n\r\n\r\n     STATE OF CALIFORNIA\r\n     HUMBOLDT COUNTY\r\n\r\n     And now comes Austin Wiley and deposes as follows:\r\n\r\n     The statement made by me in the preamble to this indenture\r\n     refering to the age of the Indian boy \"Smoky\" and the manner in\r\n     which I obtained him are true to the best of my knowledge and\r\n     belief\r\n\r\n                                   AUSTIN WILEY\r\n\r\n     Sworn to and subscribed before me on this 14th day of August A.D.\r\n     1860\r\n\r\n                                           A.

Benjamin Hayes,\r\n                              Judge of the District Court of\r\n                              the 1st Judicial District, State\r\n                              of California, County of Los Angeles.[47]\r\n\r\n     In the matter of Hannah and her children, Ann (and Mary, child of\r\n     Ann), Lawrence, Nathaniel, Jane, Charles, Marion, Martha and an\r\n     infant boy two weeks old, and of Biddy and her children Ellen,\r\n     Ann and Harriet, on petition for Habeas Corpus.\r\n\r\n     Now on this nineteenth day of January in the year of our Lord,\r\n     one thousand eight hundred and fifty-six, the said persons above\r\n     named are brought before me, in the custody of the Sheriff of\r\n     said County, all except the said Hannah and infant boy two weeks\r\n     old, (who are satisfactorily shown to be too infirm to be brought\r\n     before me,) and except Lawrence (who is necessarily occupied in\r\n     waiting on his said Mother, Hannah) and Charles (who is absent in\r\n     San Bernardino County, but within the said Judicial District:)\r\n     and said Robert Smith, Claimant also appears with his Attorney,\r\n     Alonzo Thomas, Esq. And after hearing and duly considering the\r\n     said petition for Habeas Corpus and the return of said Claimant\r\n     thereto and all the proofs and allegations of the said parties\r\n     and all the proceedings previously had herein, it appearing\r\n     satisfactorily to the judge here, that all the said persons so\r\n     suing in this case, to-wit: Hannah and her said children and\r\n     Biddy and her said Children are persons of color, and that\r\n     Charles, aged now six years, was born in the Territory of Utah of\r\n     the United States, and Marion (aged four years,) Martha (aged two\r\n     years) Mary, daughter of the said Ann and aged two years and the\r\n     said infant boy aged two weeks, were born in the State of\r\n     California and that the said Hannah, Ann, Lawrence, Nathaniel,\r\n     Jane and Charles, as well as the said Biddy, Ellen, Ann and\r\n     Harriet, have resided with the said Robert Smith for more than\r\n     four years and since some time in the year of our Lord one\r\n     thousand eight hundred and fifty-one, in the State of California;\r\n     and it further appearing that the said Robert Smith left and\r\n     removed from the State of Mississippi more than eight years ago\r\n     with the intention of not returning thereto, but of establishing\r\n     himself as a resident in Utah Territory, and more than four years\r\n     ago left and removed from said Utah Territory, with the intention\r\n     of residing and establishing himself in the State of California\r\n     and has so resided in said last mentioned State since some time\r\n     in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and fifty-one.\r\n     And it further appearing by satisfactory proof to the Judge here,\r\n     that all the said persons of color are entitled to their freedom\r\n     and are free and cannot be held in slavery or involuntary\r\n     servitude, it is therefore adjudged that they are entitled to\r\n     their freedom, and are free forever. And it further appearing to\r\n     the satisfaction of the Judge here that the said Robert Smith\r\n     intends and is about to remove from the state of California,\r\n     where slavery does not exist, to the state of Texas, where\r\n     slavery of Negroes and persons of color does exist and is\r\n     established by the municipal laws, and intends to remove said\r\n     before mentioned persons of color to his own use, without the\r\n     free will and consent of all or any of the said persons of color,\r\n     whereby their liberty will be greatly jeopardized, and there is\r\n     good reason to apprehend and believe that they may be sold into\r\n     slavery or involuntary servitude, and the said Robert Smith is\r\n     persuading and enticing and seducing, said persons of color to go\r\n     out of the State of California and to be taken and removed\r\n     therefrom with the false promise held out to them that they will\r\n     be as free in the State of Texas as in the State of California.\r\n     And it further appearing that none of said persons of color can\r\n     read and write, and are almost entirely ignorant of the laws of\r\n     the State of California, as well as those of the State of Texas,\r\n     and of their rights, and that the said Robert Smith from his past\r\n     relations to them as members of his family, possesses and\r\n     exercises over them an undue influence in respect to the matter\r\n     of their said removal insomuch that they have been in duress and\r\n     not in possession and exercise of their free will so as to give a\r\n     binding consent to any engagement or arrangement with him. And it\r\n     further appearing that the said Hannah, is aged thirty-four\r\n     years, and her daughter, Ann, seventeen years, and all her other\r\n     children, to-wit: Lawrence, (aged from twelve to thirteen years)\r\n     Nathaniel (aged from ten to eleven years), Jane, (aged eight\r\n     years) Charles (aged six years) Marion (aged four years) Martha,\r\n     (aged two years) and said infant boy of Hannah aged two weeks, as\r\n     well as Mary (aged two years), daughter of said Ann, are under\r\n     the age of fourteen years and so under the laws of the State of\r\n     California are not competent to choose a Guardian for themselves;\r\n     and it further appearing that the said Biddy is aged thirty-eight\r\n     years, and the said Ellen is aged seventeen years, and the other\r\n     children of said Biddy, to-wit: Ann (aged from twelve to\r\n     thirteen) and Harriet (aged eight years) are under the age of\r\n     fourteen years, and so by the laws of the State of California are\r\n     not competent to choose a Guardian for themselves. It further\r\n     appearing that the said infant boy two weeks of age of Hannah is\r\n     of tender age and must be kept with his said mother Hannah, the\r\n     same is accordingly ordered, and said infant boy is entrusted to\r\n     his said mother hereby, and is ordered to appear with him before\r\n     the Judge here at the Court House in the City of Los Angeles on\r\n     next Monday January 1, 1856 at 10 o'clock A.M. of said day if\r\n     her health shall so permit and if not, as soon thereafter as may\r\n     be practicable of which the Sheriff of Los Angeles is hereby\r\n     notified to notify her the said Hannah and whereof the said\r\n     Robert Smith, being now in the Court has notice, it appearing\r\n     that she resides in his house and is under his control. And the\r\n     said Mary, child of Ann appearing to be of tender age, is\r\n     entrusted to the said Ann to be brought before the Judge here at\r\n     the time and place aforesaid to be dealt with according to law of\r\n     which the said Ann and the said Robert Smith have notice here,\r\n     and the said Martha being of tender years is entrusted to the\r\n     said Ann, her sister, to be brought before the Judge here at the\r\n     time and place aforesaid to be dealt with according to law of\r\n     which the said Ann and the said Robert Smith here have notice and\r\n     the said Hannah and Ann are appointed Special Guardians\r\n     respectively of the children so hereby entrusted to them, and\r\n     notified that it is their duty to obey all lawful orders of the\r\n     Judge here or of some competent Court touching the premises. And\r\n     the further hearing of this case as to the said Hannah and infant\r\n     boy and her child, Lawrence and her children Charles and Mary and\r\n     Martha is adjourned until said last mentioned time at the Court\r\n     House of the City of Los Angeles, and it is further ordered that\r\n     the said Nathaniel (aged from ten to twelve years) Jane (aged\r\n     eight years) Marion (aged four years) all children of said\r\n     Hannah, and said child Ann (aged from twelve to thirteen years)\r\n     and Harriet (aged eight years) are committed to the custody of\r\n     the Sheriff of Los Angeles County, David W. Alexander, Esq., as\r\n     especial Guardian until the further order of the Judge here or of\r\n     other Judge or Court of competent Jurisdiction to appoint General\r\n     Guardians of aforesaid Children last mentioned, and the said\r\n     Sheriff will leave in full liberty and discharge the said Biddy\r\n     and her child Ellen (aged Seventeen years) and the said Ann only\r\n     being required to obey the said order herinbefore made to appear\r\n     before the Judge here in manner and form as aforesaid. And it\r\n     further appearing that the said Charles is absent in San\r\n     Bernardino County, within said Judicial District. It is ordered\r\n     that Robert Clift, Esq. Sheriff of said County be and he is\r\n     hereby appointed Special Guardian of said Charles and as such\r\n     duly authorized and required to take said Charles in his custody\r\n     and him safely keep in such manner that said Charles shall not be\r\n     removed out of the State of California, but shall abide the\r\n     further order of the Judge here or other Judge or Court of\r\n     competent Jurisdiction touching his Guardianship. And it is\r\n     further ordered and adjudged that all the costs accrued in the\r\n     case up to the present date and in executing the present order of\r\n     the Judge here as to the production of the said Hannah and her\r\n     said infant two weeks old and said Lawrence, Martha and Mary\r\n     before the Judge here as aforesaid shall be paid by the Said\r\n     Robert Smith.\r\n\r\n     Given under my hand as Judge of the first Judicial District of\r\n     the State of California on this 19th day of January, A.

N. Work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS JEFFERSON'S THOUGHTS ON THE NEGRO\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nJefferson, like a number of liberal-minded men of his time, execrated\r\nthe slave trade and as the following extracts will show held it as a\r\ngrievance against the British.\r\n\r\n     During the regal government we had, at one time, obtained a law\r\n     which imposed such a duty on the importation of slaves as\r\n     amounted nearly in a prohibition, when one inconsiderate\r\n     assembly, placed under a peculiarity of circumstance, repealed\r\n     the law. This repeal met a joyful sanction from the then reigning\r\n     sovereign, and no devices, no expedients which could ever be\r\n     attempted by subsequent assemblies (and they seldom met without\r\n     attempting them) could succeed in getting the royal assent to a\r\n     renewal of the duty. In the very first session held under the\r\n     republican government, the assembly passed a law for the\r\n     perpetual prohibition of the importation of slaves. This will, in\r\n     some measure, stop the increase of this great political and moral\r\n     evil, while the minds of our citizens may be ripening for a\r\n     complete emancipation of human nature.[48]\r\n\r\n     The abolition of domestic slavery is the great object of desire\r\n     in those Colonies, where it was, unhappily, introduced in their\r\n     infant state. But previous to the enfranchisement of the slaves\r\n     we have, it is necessary to exclude all further importations from\r\n     Africa. Yet our repeated attempts to effect this by prohibitions,\r\n     and by imposing duties which might amount to a prohibition, have\r\n     been hitherto defeated by his Majesty's negative: Thus preferring\r\n     the immediate advantages of a few British corsairs to the lasting\r\n     interests of the American States, and to the rights of human\r\n     nature, deeply wounded by this infamous practice.[49]\r\n\r\nWith the same thought as that of the views expressed above Jefferson\r\nincorporated into the original Declaration of Independence an\r\nindictment of George III as promoting the ruin of the colonies in\r\nencouraging the slave trade. He said:\r\n\r\n     He (George III) has waged cruel war against human nature itself,\r\n     violating its most sacred rights of life and liberty in the\r\n     persons of a distant people who never offended him, captivating\r\n     and carrying them into slavery in another hemisphere, or to incur\r\n     miserable death in their transportation thither. This piratical\r\n     warfare, the opprobrium of INFIDEL powers, is the warfare of the\r\n     CHRISTIAN KING of Great Britain. Determined to keep open a market\r\n     where MEN should be bought and sold, he has prostituted his\r\n     negative for suppressing every legislative attempt to prohibit or\r\n     to restrain this execrable commerce. And that this assemblage of\r\n     horrors might want no fact of distinguished dye, he is now\r\n     exciting those very people to rise in arms among us, and to\r\n     purchase that liberty of which he has deprived them, by murdering\r\n     the people upon whom he has obtruded them; thus paying off former\r\n     crimes committed against the LIBERTIES of one people, with crimes\r\n     which he urges them to commit against the lives of another.[50]\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nInfluenced by the struggle for the rights of man, Jefferson seriously\r\nadvocated freeing the Negroes, that they too might work out their own\r\ndestiny on foreign soil. He did not think that it would be wise to\r\nleave the freedmen in this country controlled by white men by whom he\r\nbelieved they should not be assimilated.[51] The first time he had an\r\nopportunity, therefore, he made an effort in this direction. This was\r\nthe case of his work in connection with the committee appointed to\r\nrevise the laws of Virginia, the report of which he prepared.\r\n\r\nJefferson said:\r\n\r\n     The bill reported by the revisers of the whole (Virginia) code\r\n     does not itself contain the proposition to emancipate all slaves\r\n     born after the passing the act; but an amendment containing it\r\n     was prepared, to be offered to the Legislature whenever the bill\r\n     should be taken up, and further directing, that they should\r\n     continue with their parents to a certain age, then to be brought\r\n     up, at the public expense, to tillage, arts or sciences,\r\n     according to their geniuses, till the females should be eighteen,\r\n     and the males twenty-one years of age, when they should be\r\n     colonized to such place as the circumstances of the time should\r\n     render most proper, sending them out with arms, implements of\r\n     household and of the handicraft arts; seeds, pairs of the useful\r\n     domestic animals, &c., to declare them a free and independent\r\n     people, and extend to them our alliance and protection, till they\r\n     shall have acquired strength; and to send vessels at the same\r\n     time to other parts of the world for an equal number of white\r\n     inhabitants; to induce them to migrate hither, proper\r\n     encouragements were to be proposed.[52]\r\n\r\nDiscussing the serious difficulties of the problem, he compared that\r\nof the Romans with the situation in the colonies:\r\n\r\n     This unfortunate difference of color, and perhaps of faculty, is\r\n     a powerful obstacle to the emancipation of these people. Many of\r\n     their advocates, while they wish to vindicate the liberty of\r\n     human nature, are anxious also to preserve its dignity and\r\n     beauty. Some of these, embarrassed by the question; \"What further\r\n     is to be done with them?\" join themselves in opposition with\r\n     those who are actuated by sordid avarice only. Among the Romans\r\n     emancipation required but one effort. The slave, when made free,\r\n     might mix with, without straining the blood of his master. But\r\n     with us a second is necessary, unknown to history. When freed, he\r\n     is to be removed beyond the reach of mixture.[53]\r\n\r\nWriting to John Lynch in 1811, Jeff arson gave his ideas as to the\r\npossibility of successful African colonization.\r\n\r\n     You ask my opinion on the proposition of Mrs. Mifflin, to take\r\n     measures for procuring, on the coast of Africa, an establishment\r\n     to which the people of color of these States might, from time to\r\n     time be colonized, under the auspices of different governments.\r\n     Having long ago made up my mind on this subject, I have no\r\n     hesitation in saying that I have ever thought it the most\r\n     desirable measure which could be adopted, for gradually drawing\r\n     off this part of our population, most advantageously for\r\n     themselves as well as for us. Going from a country possessing all\r\n     the useful arts, they might be the means of transplanting them\r\n     among the inhabitants of Africa, and would thus carry back to the\r\n     country of their origin, the seeds of civilization which might\r\n     render their sojournment and sufferings here a blessing in the\r\n     end to that country.[54]\r\n\r\n     Nothing is more to be wished than that the United States would\r\n     themselves undertake to make such an establishment on the coast\r\n     of Africa. Exclusive of motives of humanity, the commercial\r\n     advantages to be derived from it might repay all its expenses.\r\n     But for this, the national mind is not yet prepared. It may\r\n     perhaps be doubted whether many of these people would voluntarily\r\n     consent to such an exchange of situation, and very certain that\r\n     few of those advanced to a certain age in habits of slavery,\r\n     would be capable of self-government. This should not, however,\r\n     discourage the experiment, not the early trial of it.[55]\r\n\r\n     I received in the first year of my coming into the administration\r\n     of the General Government, a letter from the Governor of Virginia\r\n     (Colonel Monroe), consulting me, at the request of the\r\n     Legislature of the State, on the means of procuring some such\r\n     asylum, to which these people might be occasionally sent. I\r\n     proposed to him the establishment of Sierra Leone, in which a\r\n     private company in England had already colonized a number of\r\n     negroes and particularly the fugitives from these States during\r\n     the Revolutionary War; and at the same time suggested, if this\r\n     could be obtained, some of the Portuguese possessions in South\r\n     America, as next most desirable. The subsequent Legislature\r\n     approving these ideas, I wrote, the ensuing year, 1802, to Mr.\r\n     King, our Minister in London, to endeavor to negotiate with the\r\n     Sierra Leone company a reception of such of these people as might\r\n     be colonized thither. He opened a correspondence with Mr.\r\n     Wedderbourne and Mr. Thornton, secretaries of the company, on the\r\n     subject, and, in 1803, I received through Mr. King the result,\r\n     which was that the colony was going on, but in a languishing\r\n     condition; that the funds of the company were likely to fail, as\r\n     they received no returns of profit to keep them up; that they\r\n     were, therefore, in treaty with their government to take the\r\n     establishment off their hands; but that in no event should they\r\n     be willing to receive more of these people from the United\r\n     States, as it was exactly that portion of their settlers which\r\n     had gone from hence, which, by their idleness and turbulence, had\r\n     kept the settlement in constant danger of dissolution, which\r\n     could not have been prevented but for the aid of the maroon\r\n     negroes from the West Indies, who were more industrious and\r\n     orderly than the others, and supported the authority of the\r\n     government and its laws ... The effort which I made with\r\n     Portugal, to obtain an establishment for them within their claims\r\n     in South America, proved also abortive.[56]\r\n\r\nIn this extract Jefferson goes a step further in presenting a scheme\r\nfor financing the project, giving even the exact amount which he\r\nthought would suffice.\r\n\r\n     In the disposition of these unfortunate people, there are two\r\n     rational objects to be distinctly kept in view. First. The\r\n     establishment of a colony on the coast of Africa, which may\r\n     introduce among the aborigines the arts of cultivated life and\r\n     the blessings of civilization and science. By doing this, we may\r\n     make to them some retribution for the long course of injuries we\r\n     have been committing on their population. And considering that\r\n     these blessings will descend to the _nati natorum et qui\r\n     nascentur ab illis_, we shall in the long run have rendered them\r\n     perhaps more good than evil. To fulfil this object, the colony of\r\n     Sierra Leone promises well, and that of Mesurado adds to our\r\n     prospect of success. Under this view the Colonization Society is\r\n     to be considered as a missionary society, having in view,\r\n     however, objects more humane, more justifiable, and less\r\n     aggressive on the peace of other nations than the others of that\r\n     appelation. The second object, and the most interesting to us, as\r\n     coming home to our physical and moral characters, to our\r\n     happiness and safety, is to provide an asylum to which we can, by\r\n     degrees, send the whole of that population from among us, and\r\n     establish them under our patronage and protection, as a separate,\r\n     free and independent people, in some country and climate friendly\r\n     to human life and happiness. That any place on the coast of\r\n     Africa should answer the latter purpose, I have ever deemed\r\n     entirely impossible. And without repeating the other arguments\r\n     which have been urged by others, I will appeal to figures only,\r\n     which admit no controversy.[57]\r\n\r\n     There is, I think, a way in which (the removal of the slaves to\r\n     another country) can be done; that is by emancipating the\r\n     after-born, leaving them, on due compensation, with their\r\n     mothers, until their services are worth their maintenance, and\r\n     then putting them to industrious occupations until a proper age\r\n     for deportation. This was the result of my reflections on the\r\n     subject five and forty years ago, and I have never yet been able\r\n     to conceive any other practicable plan. It was sketched in the\r\n     _Notes of Virginia_. The estimated value of the new-born infant\r\n     is so low (say twelve dollars and fifty cents) that it would\r\n     probably be yielded by the owner gratis, and would thus reduce\r\n     the six hundred millions of dollars, the first head of expense,\r\n     to thirty-seven millions and a half; leaving only the expenses of\r\n     nourishment while with the mother, and of transportation.[58]\r\n\r\n     From what fund are these expenses to be furnished? Why not from\r\n     that of the lands which have been ceded by the very States now\r\n     needing this relief? And ceded on no consideration, for the most\r\n     part, but that of the general good of the whole. These cessions\r\n     already constitute one-fourth of the States of the Union. It may\r\n     be said that these lands have been sold; are not the property of\r\n     the citizens composing these States; and the money long ago\r\n     received and expended. But an equivalent of lands in the\r\n     territories since acquired may be appropriated to that object, or\r\n     so much, at least, as may be sufficient; and the object, although\r\n     more important to the slave States, is highly so to the others\r\n     also, if they were serious in their arguments on the Missouri\r\n     question. The slave States, too, if more interested, would also\r\n     contribute more by their gratutious liberation, thus taking on\r\n     themselves alone the first and heaviest item of expense.[59]\r\n\r\nAs the proper place for the colonization of emancipated blacks seemed\r\nquite a problem, almost any seemingly desirable place was recommended.\r\nSanto Domingo proved to be attractive after the bloody scenes of the\r\nrevolution had passed away.\r\n\r\n     In the plan sketched in the _Notes on Virginia_, no particular\r\n     place of asylum was specified; because it was thought possible\r\n     that in the revolutionary state of America, then commenced,\r\n     events might open to us some one within practicable distance.\r\n     This has now happened. Santo Domingo has become independent, and\r\n     with a population of that color only; and if the public papers\r\n     are to be credited, their Chief offers to pay their passage, to\r\n     receive them as free citizens, and to provide them employment.\r\n     This leaves, then, for the general confederacy, no expense but\r\n     that of nurture with the mother for a few years, and would call,\r\n     of course, for a very moderate appropriation of the vacant\r\n     lands.... In this way no violation of private right is\r\n     proposed.[60]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nIn his _Notes on Virginia_ Jefferson discusses all of the phases of\r\nslavery as they appeared to him at that time. He took up the\r\njustification of the institution of slavery among the Romans, the\r\nenslavement of the Indian and the Negroes, the cause of the increase\r\nin slaves, and the effects of the same on both the masters and the\r\nenslaved.[61]\r\n\r\n     An inhuman practice once prevailed in this country, of making\r\n     slaves of the Indians. This practice commenced with the Spaniards\r\n     with the first discovery of America.[62]\r\n\r\n     Under the mild treatment our slaves experience, and their\r\n     wholesome, though coarse food, this blot in our country increase\r\n     as fast, or faster than the whites.[63]\r\n\r\n     We know that among the Romans, about the Augustan age especially,\r\n     the condition of their slaves was much more deplorable than that\r\n     of the blacks on the continent of America. The two sexes were\r\n     confined in separate apartments, because to raise a child cost\r\n     the master more than to buy one. Cato, for a very restricted\r\n     indulgence to his slaves in this particular, took from them a\r\n     certain price. But in this country the slaves multiply as fast as\r\n     the free inhabitants.... The same Cato, on a principle of\r\n     economy, always sold his sick and superannuated slaves. He gives\r\n     it as a standing precept to a master visiting his farm, to sell\r\n     his old oxen, old wagons, old tools, old and diseased servants,\r\n     and everything else become useless.... The American slaves cannot\r\n     enumerate this among the injuries and insults they receive. It\r\n     was the common practice to expose in the island AEsculapius, in\r\n     the Tiber, diseased slaves whose cure was likely to become\r\n     tedious. The Emperor Claudius, by an edict, gave freedom to such\r\n     of them as should recover, and first declared that if any person\r\n     chose to kill rather than expose them, it should be deemed\r\n     homicide. The exposing them is a crime of which no instance has\r\n     existed with us; and were it to be followed by death, it would be\r\n     punished capitally. We are told of a certain Vedius Pollio, who,\r\n     in the presence of Augustus, would have given a slave as food to\r\n     his fish for having broken a glass. With the Romans, the regular\r\n     method of taking the evidence of their slaves was under torture.\r\n     Here it has been thought better never to resort to their\r\n     evidence. When a master was murdered, all his slaves, in the same\r\n     house, or within hearing, were condemned to death. Here\r\n     punishment falls on the guilty only, and as precise proof is\r\n     required against his as against a freeman. Yet notwithstanding\r\n     these and other discouraging circumstances among the Romans,\r\n     their slaves were often their rarest artists. They excelled, too,\r\n     in science, insomuch as to be usually employed as tutors to their\r\n     master's children. Epictetus, Terence, and Phoedrus, were slaves.\r\n     But they were of the race of whites. It is not their condition\r\n     then, but nature which has produced the distinction. Whether\r\n     further observation will or will not verify the conjecture, that\r\n     nature has been less bountiful to them in the endowments of the\r\n     head, I believe that in those of the heart she will be found to\r\n     have done them justice.[64]\r\n\r\n     That disposition to theft with which they have been branded, must\r\n     be ascribed to their situation, and not to any depravity of the\r\n     moral sense. The man in whose favor no laws of property exist,\r\n     probably feels himself less bound to respect those made in favor\r\n     of others. When arguing for ourselves, we lay it down as a\r\n     fundamental, that laws, to be just, must give a reciprocation of\r\n     right; that, without this, they are mere arbitrary rules of\r\n     conduct, founded in force, and not in conscience; and it is a\r\n     problem which I give to the master to solve, whether the\r\n     religious precepts against the violation of property were not\r\n     framed for him as well as his slave? And whether the slave may\r\n     not as justifiably take a little from one who has taken all from\r\n     him, as he may slay one who would slay him? That a change in the\r\n     relations in which a man is placed should change his ideas of\r\n     moral right or wrong, is neither new, nor peculiar to the color\r\n     of the blacks. Homer tells us it was so two thousand six hundred\r\n     years ago.[65]\r\n\r\n     The whole commerce between master and slave is a perpetual\r\n     exercise of the most boisterous passions, the most unremitting\r\n     despotism on the one part, and degrading submissions on the\r\n     other. Our children see this, and learn to imitate it; for man is\r\n     an imitative animal. This quality is the germ of all education in\r\n     him. From his cradle to his grave he is learning to do what he\r\n     sees others do. If a parent could find no motive either in his\r\n     philanthropy or his self-love, for restraining the intemperance\r\n     of passion towards his slave, it should always be a sufficient\r\n     one that his child is present. But, generally, it is not\r\n     sufficient. The parent storms, the child looks on, catches the\r\n     lineaments of wrath, puts on the same airs in the circle of\r\n     smaller slaves, gives a loose to the worst of passions, and thus\r\n     nursed, educated, and daily exercised in tyranny, cannot but be\r\n     stamped by it with odious peculiarities. The man must be a\r\n     prodigy who can retain his manners and morals undepraved by such\r\n     circumstances. And with what execrations should the statesman be\r\n     loaded, who, permitting one-half the citizens thus to trample on\r\n     the rights of the other, transforms those into despots, and these\r\n     into enemies, destroys the morals of the one part, and the _amor\r\n     patriae_ of the other. For if a slave can have a country in this\r\n     world, it must be any other in preference to that in which he is\r\n     born to live and labor for another; in which he must lock up the\r\n     faculties of his nature, contribute as far as depends on his\r\n     inhuman race, or entail his own miserable condition on the\r\n     endless generations proceeding from him.[66]\r\n\r\n     Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have\r\n     removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the\r\n     people that these liberties are of the gift of God? That they\r\n     are not to be violated but with his wrath? Indeed, I tremble for\r\n     my country when I reflect that God is just; that his justice\r\n     cannot sleep forever; that considering numbers, nature and\r\n     natural means only, a revolution of the wheel of fortune, an\r\n     exchange of situation is among possible events; that it may\r\n     become probable by supernatural interference! The Almighty has no\r\n     attribute which can take side with us in such a contest.[67]\r\n\r\n     With the morals of the people, their industry also is destroyed.\r\n     For in a warm climate, no man will labor for himself who can make\r\n     another labor for him. This is so true that of the proprietors of\r\n     slaves a very small proportion indeed are ever seen to labor.[68]\r\n\r\n     It is impossible to be temperate and to pursue this subject\r\n     through the various considerations of policy, or morals, of\r\n     history, natural and civil. We must be contented to hope they\r\n     will force their way into every one's mind.... The way, I hope,\r\n     is preparing, under the auspices of heaven, for a total\r\n     emancipation, and that this is disposed, in the order of events,\r\n     to be with the consent of the masters, rather than by their\r\n     extirpation.[69]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of Jefferson's public career he did not have a\r\ngood opinion of the Negro and his possibilities. This is his attitude\r\nas expressed in his _Notes on Virginia_ in 1782, whenever he referred\r\nto the Negro. Ignorant of the fact that science shows that no race is\r\nsuperior to another, Jefferson considered the blacks inferior to the\r\nIndians, believed that they lacked literary ability, the finer senses\r\nof other races and although exhibiting a little aptitude in music were\r\nboth physically and mentally inferior to the whites.\r\n\r\n     It will probably be asked, why not retain and incorporate the\r\n     blacks into the State, and thus save the expense of supplying by\r\n     importation of white settlers, the vacancies they will leave?\r\n     Deep-rooted prejudices entertained by the whites; ten thousand\r\n     recollections, by the blacks, of the injuries they have\r\n     sustained; new provocations; the real distinctions which nature\r\n     has made; and many other circumstances will divide us into\r\n     parties, and produce convulsions, which will probably never end\r\n     but in the extermination of the one or the other race.[70]\r\n\r\n     To these objections, which are political may be added others,\r\n     which are physical and moral. Whether the black of the negro\r\n     resides in the reticular membrane between the skin and\r\n     scarf-skin, or in the scarf-skin itself; whether it proceeds from\r\n     the color of the blood, the color of the bile, or from that of\r\n     some other secretion, the difference is fixed in nature, and is\r\n     as real as if its seat and cause were better known to us. And is\r\n     this difference of no importance? Is it not the foundation of a\r\n     greater or less suffusions of color in the one, preferable to\r\n     that eternal monotony, which reign in the countenances, that\r\n     immovable veil of black which covers all the emotions of the\r\n     other race? Add to these, flowing hair, a more elegant symmetry\r\n     of form, their own judgment in favor of the whites, declared by\r\n     their preference of them, as uniformly as is the preference of\r\n     the Oranootan for the black woman over those of his own species.\r\n     The circumstance of superior beauty, is thought worthy attention\r\n     in the propagation of our horses, dogs, and other domestic\r\n     animals; why not in that of man? Besides those of color, figure,\r\n     and hair, there are other physical distinctions proving a\r\n     difference of race. They have less hair on the face and body.\r\n     They secrete less by the kidneys, and more by the glands of the\r\n     skin, which gives them a very strong and disagreeable odor. This\r\n     greater degree of transpiration renders them more tolerant of\r\n     heat, and less of cold than the whites. Perhaps, too, a\r\n     difference of structure in the pulmonary apparatus, which a late\r\n     ingenious experimentalist (Crawford) has discovered to be the\r\n     principal regulator of animal heat, may have disabled them from\r\n     extricating, in the act of inspiration, so much of that fluid\r\n     from the outer air, or obliged them in expiration, to part with\r\n     more of it.[71]\r\n\r\n     They seem to require less sleep. A black, after hard labor\r\n     through the day, will be induced by the slightest amusements to\r\n     sit up till midnight, or later, though knowing he must be out\r\n     with the first dawn of the morning.[72]\r\n\r\n     In general, their existence appears to participate more sensation\r\n     than reflection. To this must be ascribed their disposition to\r\n     sleep when abstracted from their diversions, and unemployed in\r\n     labor. An animal whose body is at rest, and who does not reflect,\r\n     must be disposed to sleep of course.[73]\r\n\r\n     Their griefs are transient. Those numberless afflictions, which\r\n     render it doubtful whether Heaven has given life to us in mercy\r\n     or in wrath, are less felt, and sooner forgotten with them.[74]\r\n\r\n     Comparing them by their faculties of memory, reason, and\r\n     imagination, it appears to me that in memory they are equal to\r\n     the whites; in reason much inferior, as I think one could\r\n     scarcely be found capable of tracing and comprehending the\r\n     investigations of Euclid; and that in imagination they are dull,\r\n     tasteless, and anomalous. It would be unfair to follow them to\r\n     Africa for this investigation. We will consider them here, on the\r\n     same stage with the whites, and where the facts are not\r\n     apocryphal on which a judgment is to be formed. It will be right\r\n     to make great allowances for the difference of condition, of\r\n     education, of conversation, of the sphere in which they move.\r\n     Many millions of them have been brought to, and born in America.\r\n     Most of them, indeed, have been confined to tillage, to their own\r\n     homes, and their own society; yet many of them have been so\r\n     situated that they might have availed themselves of the\r\n     conversation of their masters; many of them have been brought up\r\n     to the handicraft arts, and from that circumstance have always\r\n     been associated with the whites. Some have been liberally\r\n     educated, and all have lived in countries where the arts and\r\n     sciences are cultivated to a considerable degree, and have had\r\n     before their eyes samples of the best works from abroad. The\r\n     Indians, with no advantages of this kind, will often carve\r\n     figures on their pipes not destitute of design and merit. They\r\n     will crayon out an animal, a plant, or a country, so as to prove\r\n     the existence of a germ in their minds which only wants\r\n     cultivation. They astonish you with strokes of the most sublime\r\n     oratory; such as prove their reason and sentiment strong, their\r\n     imagination glowing and elevated. But never yet could I find that\r\n     a black had uttered a thought above the level of plain narration;\r\n     never saw ever an elementary trait of painting or sculpture.[75]\r\n\r\n     In music they are more generally gifted than the whites, with\r\n     accurate ears for tune and time, and they have been found capable\r\n     of imagining a small catch. Whether they will be equal to the\r\n     composition of a more extensive run of melody, or of complicated\r\n     harmony, is yet to be proved.[76]\r\n\r\n     Misery is often the parent of the most affecting touches in\r\n     poetry. Among the blacks is misery enough, God knows, but no\r\n     poetry. Their love is ardent, but it kindles the senses only, not\r\n     the imagination. Religion, indeed, has produced a Phyllis\r\n     Wheatley; but it could not produce a poet. The compositions\r\n     published under her name are below the dignity of criticism. The\r\n     heroes of the Dunciad are to her, as Hercules to the author of\r\n     that poem.[77]\r\n\r\n     Ignatius Sancho has approached nearer to merit in composition\r\n     (than Phyllis Wheatley); yet his letters do more honor to the\r\n     heart than the head. They breathe the purest effusions of\r\n     friendship and general philanthropy, and show how great a degree\r\n     of the latter may be compounded with strong religious zeal. He is\r\n     often happy in the turn of his compliments, and his style is easy\r\n     and familiar, except when he affects a Shandean fabrication of\r\n     words. But his imagination is wild and extravagant, escapes\r\n     incessantly from every restraint of reason and taste, and, in the\r\n     course of its vagaries, leaves a tract of thought as incoherent\r\n     and eccentric, as is the course of a meteor through the sky. His\r\n     subjects should often have led him to a process of sober\r\n     reasoning; yet we find him always substituting sentiment for\r\n     demonstration. Upon the whole, though we admit him to the first\r\n     place among those of his own color who have presented themselves\r\n     to the public judgment, yet when compare him with the writers of\r\n     the race among whom he lived and particularly with the epistolary\r\n     class in which he has taken his own stand, we are compelled to\r\n     enroll him at the bottom of the column. This criticism supposes\r\n     the letters published under the name to be genuine, and to have\r\n     received amendment from no other hand; points which would not be\r\n     of easy investigation.[78]\r\n\r\n     The improvement of the blacks in body and mind, in the first\r\n     instance of their mixture with the whites, has been observed by\r\n     every one, and proves that their inferiority is not the effect\r\n     merely of their condition in life.[79]\r\n\r\n     The opinion that they are inferior in the faculties of reason and\r\n     imagination, must be hazarded with great diffidence. To justify a\r\n     general conclusion, requires many observations, even where the\r\n     subject may be submitted to the anatomical knife, to optical\r\n     glasses, to analysis by fire or by solvents. How much more then\r\n     where it is a faculty, not a substance, we are examining; where\r\n     it eludes the research of all the senses; where the conditions of\r\n     its existence are various and variously combined; where the\r\n     effects of those which are present or absent bid defiance to\r\n     calculation; let me all too, as a circumstance of great\r\n     tenderness, where our conclusion would degrade a whole race of\r\n     men from the rank in the scale of beings which their Creator may\r\n     perhaps have given them. To our reproach it must be said, that\r\n     though for a century and a half we have had under our eyes the\r\n     races of black and or red men, they have never yet been viewed by\r\n     us as subjects of natural history. I advance it, therefore, as a\r\n     suspicion only, that the blacks, whether originally a distinct\r\n     race, or made distinct by time and circumstances, are inferior to\r\n     the whites in the endowments both of body and mind. It is not\r\n     against experience to suppose that different species of the same\r\n     genus, or varieties of the same species, may possess different\r\n     qualifications. Will not a lover of natural history, then, one\r\n     who views the gradations in all the races of animals with the eye\r\n     of philosophy, excuse an effort to keep those in the department\r\n     of man as distinct as nature has formed them?[80]\r\n\r\nHe was impressed, however, with the integrity of the Negroes and paid\r\nthem the following tribute:\r\n\r\n     Notwithstanding these considerations which must weaken their\r\n     respect for the laws of property, we find among them numerous\r\n     instances of the most rigid integrity, and as many as among their\r\n     better instructed masters, of benevolence, gratitude, and\r\n     unshaken fidelity.[81]\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nIn later years it seems that Jefferson changed from his position of\r\ncertainty as to the inferiority of the Negro to that of doubt. At one\r\ntime he believed in the possibilities of the Negro and then again he\r\nreceded from that position to take up the argument that the blacks\r\nlack the capacity with which the whites are endowed. Jefferson shows\r\nthat he was either ill-informed or insincere. Writing to General\r\nChastellux in 1785 concerning the future of the Negro Jefferson\r\nremarked:\r\n\r\n     I have supposed the black man, in his present state might not be\r\n     in body and mind equal to the white man; but it would be\r\n     hazardous to affirm, that, equally cultivated for a few\r\n     generations, he would not become so.[82]\r\n\r\nTo Benjamin Banneker, the surveyor and astronomer, who was regarded by\r\nsome as his friend, he addressed the following in 1791:\r\n\r\n     Nobody wishes more than I do to see such proofs as you exhibit,\r\n     that nature has given to our black brethren talents equal to\r\n     those of the other colors of men, and that the appearance of a\r\n     want of them is owing merely to the degraded condition of their\r\n     existence, both in Africa and America.... I have taken the\r\n     liberty of sending your Almanac to Monsieur de Condorcet,\r\n     Secretary of the Academy of Sciences at Paris, and member of the\r\n     Philanthropic Society, because I considered it as a document to\r\n     which your color had a right for their justification against the\r\n     doubts which have been entertained of them[83]\r\n\r\nJefferson's letter to the Marquis de Condorcet presented Banneker's\r\nattainments as evidence of the mental capacity of Negroes. He said:\r\n\r\n     We have now in the United States a Negro, the son of a black man\r\n     born in Africa and a black woman born in the United States, who\r\n     is a very respectable mathematician. I procured him to be\r\n     employed under one of our chief directors in laying out the new\r\n     Federal City on the Potomac and in the intervals of his leisure,\r\n     while on that work, he made an almanac for the next year, which\r\n     he sent me in his own handwriting, and which I enclose to you. I\r\n     have seen very elegant solutions of geometrical problems by him.\r\n     Add to this that he is a very worthy and respectable member of\r\n     society. He is a free man. I shall be delighted to see these\r\n     instances of moral eminence so multiplied as to prove that the\r\n     want of talents observed in them, is merely the effect of their\r\n     degraded condition, and not proceeding from any difference in the\r\n     structure of the parts on which intellect depends[84]\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Banneker himself concerning the achievements of this\r\nastronomer and mathematician, Jefferson said:\r\n\r\n     Nobody wishes more ardently than I do to see a good system\r\n     commenced for raising the condition both of their body and mind\r\n     to what it ought to be, as fast as the imbecility of their\r\n     present existence, and other circumstances which cannot be\r\n     neglected, will admit.[85]\r\n\r\nA generation later he had, as this letter indicates, retained the\r\nopinion that the possibilities of the Negroes were not necessarily\r\nlimited. To Henri Gregoire who had sent Jefferson a copy of his\r\n_Litterature des Negres_, he wrote:\r\n\r\n     Be assured that no person living wishes more sincerely than I do\r\n     to see a complete refutation of the doubts I have myself\r\n     entertained and expressed on the grade of understanding allotted\r\n     to the negroes by nature, and to find that in this respect they\r\n     are on a par with ourselves. My doubts were the result of\r\n     personal observation on the limited sphere of my own State, where\r\n     the opportunities for the development of their genius were not\r\n     favorable, and those of exercising it still less so. I expressed\r\n     them, therefore, with great hesitation; but whatever be their\r\n     degree of talent it is no measure of their rights. Because Sir\r\n     Isaac Newton was superior to others in understanding, he was not\r\n     therefore lord of the person or property of others. On this\r\n     subject they are gaining daily in the opinions of nations, and\r\n     hopeful advances are making towards their reestablishment on an\r\n     equal footing with the other colors of the human family. I pray\r\n     you, therefore, to accept my thanks for the many instances you\r\n     have enabled me to observe of respectable intelligence in that\r\n     race of men, which cannot fail to have effect in hastening the\r\n     day of their relief.[86]\r\n\r\nWriting to Joel Barlow about the same time Jefferson showed a\r\ndifferent attitude. He said:\r\n\r\n     Bishop Gregoire wrote to me on the doubts I had expressed five or\r\n     six and twenty years ago, in the _Notes on Virginia_, as to the\r\n     grade of understanding of the negroes. His credulity has made him\r\n     gather up every story he could find of men of color (without\r\n     distinguishing whether black, or of what degree of mixture),\r\n     however slight the mention, or light the authority on which they\r\n     are quoted. The whole do not amount, in point of evidence, to\r\n     what we know ourselves of Banneker. We know he had spherical\r\n     trigonometry enough to make almanacs, but not without the\r\n     suspicion of aid from Ellicot, who was his neighbor and friend,\r\n     and never missed an opportunity of puffing him. I have a long\r\n     letter from Banneker, which shows him to have had a mind of very\r\n     common stature indeed. As to Bishop Gregoire, I wrote him a very\r\n     soft answer. It was impossible for doubt to have been more\r\n     tenderly or hesitantingly expressed than that was in the _Notes\r\n     on Virginia_, and nothing was or is further from my intentions,\r\n     than to enlist myself as the champion of a fixed opinion, where I\r\n     have only expressed a doubt. St. Domingo will, in time, throw\r\n     light on the question.[87]\r\n\r\nHe did believe, however, in the industry of the Negroes and thought\r\nthat this virtue of theirs would make their colonization possible.\r\nConcerning such a project he wrote Miss Fanny Wright in 1825:\r\n\r\n     An opinion is hazarded by some, but proved by none, that moral\r\n     urgencies are not sufficient to induce the negro to labor; that\r\n     nothing can do this but physical coercion. But this a problem\r\n     which the present age alone is prepared to solve by experiment.\r\n     It would be a solecism to suppose a race or animals created,\r\n     without sufficient foresight and energy to preserve their own\r\n     existence. It is disproved, too, by the fact that they exist, and\r\n     have existed through all the ages of history. We are not\r\n     sufficiently acquainted with all the nations of Africa, to say\r\n     that there may not be some in which habits of industry are\r\n     established, and the arts practiced which are necessary to render\r\n     life comfortable. The experiment now in progress in St. Domingo,\r\n     those of Sierra Leone and Cape Mesurado, are but beginning. Your\r\n     proposition has its aspects of promise also; and should it not\r\n     fully answer to calculations in figures, it may yet, in its\r\n     developments, lead to happy results.[88]\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nJefferson believed that the emancipation of the slaves could be\r\neffected by legislation. To this end he made several noteworthy\r\nefforts. In 1776 he submitted to the revolutionary convention in\r\nVirginia a constitution in which was incorporated the clause\r\nprohibiting slavery. He undertook also to induce the legislature of\r\nVirginia to take this step in 1783, and as chairman of the committee\r\nof the Congress of the Confederation appointed to draw up an ordinance\r\nfor the government of the Northwest Territory, he submitted a plan\r\nproviding that after the year 1800 neither slavery nor involuntary\r\nservitude should exist there. These clauses and some comments thereon\r\nfollow:\r\n\r\n     No person hereafter coming into this country shall be held within\r\n     the same in slavery under any pretext whatever.--Proposed Va.\r\n     Constitution.[89]\r\n\r\n     The General Assembly (of Virginia) shall not have power to ...\r\n     permit the introduction of any more slaves to reside in this\r\n     State, or the continuance of slavery beyond the generation which\r\n     shall be living on the 31st day of December, 1800; all persons\r\n     born after that day being hereby declared free.[90]--Proposed\r\n     Constitution for Virginia.\r\n\r\n     After the year 1800 of the Christian era, there shall be neither\r\n     slavery nor involuntary servitude in any of the said States,\r\n     otherwise than in punishment of crimes, whereof the party shall\r\n     have been duly convicted to have been personally\r\n     guilty.[91]--Proposed Ordinance of 1784.\r\n\r\n     \"The clause respecting slavery,\" said he \"was lost by an\r\n     individual vote only. Ten States were present. The four Eastern\r\n     States, New York and Pennsylvania, were for the clause. Jersey\r\n     would have been for it, but there were but two members, one of\r\n     whom was sick in his chambers. South Carolina, Maryland, and\r\n     Virginia! voted against it. North Carolina was divided, as would\r\n     have been Virginia, had not one of its delegates been sick in\r\n     bed.\"[92]\r\n\r\n     \"I congratulate you\" said he to a coworker, \"on the law of your\r\n     state (South Carolina) for suspending the importation of slaves,\r\n     and for the glory you have justly acquired by endeavoring to\r\n     prevent it forever.\"[93]\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nJefferson seemed to get further from the idea of immediate\r\nemancipation, looking upon it as a very serious problem. He tended, as\r\nthe following extracts will show, to advocate lightening the burden of\r\nthe slave, hoping that in the West Indies, where he thought the Negro\r\nwould eventually rule absolutely, the blacks might establish\r\ngovernments to which freedmen gradually emancipated in the United\r\nStates might be sent to shape their own destiny.\r\n\r\nWriting to Dr. Price concerning his anti-slavery pamphlet, Jefferson\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     Southward of the Chesapeake, your pamphlet (against slavery) will\r\n     find but few readers concurring with it in sentiment on the\r\n     subject of slavery. From the mouth to the head of the Chesapeake,\r\n     the bulk of the people will approve it in theory, and it will\r\n     find a respectable minority ready to adopt it in practice; a\r\n     minority which for weight and worth of character preponderates\r\n     against the greater number, who have not the courage to divest\r\n     their families of a property which, however, keeps their\r\n     conscience unquiet. Northward of the Chesapeake, you may find\r\n     here and there an opponent to your doctrine, as you may find here\r\n     and there a robber and murderer; but in no greater number. In\r\n     that part of America, there being but few slaves, they can easily\r\n     disencumber themselves of them; and emancipation is put into such\r\n     a train that in a few years there will be no slaves northward of\r\n     Maryland. In Maryland, I do not find such a disposition to begin\r\n     the redress of this enormity as in Virginia. This is the next\r\n     State to which we may turn our eyes for the interesting spectacle\r\n     of justice in conflict with avarice and oppression; a conflict\r\n     wherein the sacred side is gaining daily recruits from the influx\r\n     into office of young men grown, and growing up. These have sucked\r\n     in the principles of liberty, as it were, with their mother's\r\n     milk; and it is to them I look with anxiety to turn the fate of\r\n     this question. Be not therefore discouraged. What you have\r\n     written will do a great deal of good.[94]\r\n\r\nIn his report to Congress of a conference with Count Vergennes,\r\nForeign Minister of France, on commerce, Jefferson wrote:\r\n\r\n     The British army, after ravaging the State of Virginia, had sent\r\n     off a very great number of slaves to New York. By the seventh\r\n     article of the treaty of peace, they stipulated not to carry away\r\n     any of these. Notwithstanding this, it was known, when they were\r\n     evacuating New York, that they were carrying away the slaves,\r\n     General Washington made an official demand of Sir Guy Carleton,\r\n     that he should cease to send them away. He answered, that these\r\n     people had come to them under promise of the King's protection,\r\n     and that that promise should be fulfilled in preference to the\r\n     stipulation in the treaty. The State of Virginia, to which nearly\r\n     the whole of these slaves belonged, passed a law to forbid the\r\n     recovery of debts due to British subjects. They declared, at the\r\n     same time, they would repeal the law, if Congress were of opinion\r\n     they ought to do it. But, desirous that their citizens should be\r\n     discharging their debts, they afterwards permitted British\r\n     creditors to prosecute their suits, and to receive their debts in\r\n     seven equal and annual payments for reimbursement.[95]\r\n\r\nJefferson's letter here to M. de Meunier on the passage of the\r\nOrdinance of 1787 shows how he either shifted from his position of\r\nregarding emancipation a serious problem to that of agitating against\r\nslavery or that he varied his correspondence to suit the person\r\naddressed.\r\n\r\n     There were ten States present; six voted unanimously for it,\r\n     three against it, and one was divided; and seven votes being\r\n     requisite to decide the proposition affirmatively, it was lost.\r\n     The voice of a single individual of the State which was divided,\r\n     or of one of those which were of the negative, would have\r\n     prevented this abominable crime from spreading itself over the\r\n     new country. Thus we see the fate of millions unborn hanging on\r\n     the tongue of one man, and heaven was silent in that awful\r\n     moment! But it is to be hoped it will not always be silent, and\r\n     that the friends to the rights of human nature will in the end\r\n     prevail.\r\n\r\n     What a stupendous, what an incomprehensible machine is man! who\r\n     can endure toil, famine, stripes, imprisonment, and death itself,\r\n     in vindication of his own liberty, and, the next moment, be deaf\r\n     to all those motives whose power supported him through his\r\n     trial, and inflict on his fellow men a bondage, one hour of which\r\n     is fraught with more misery than ages of that which he rose in\r\n     rebellion to oppose.[96]\r\n\r\nHe seemed to regard it later as a problem to be solved only by\r\nmiraculous methods.\r\n\r\n     We must await with patience the workings of an overruling\r\n     Providence, and hope that that is preparing the deliverance of\r\n     these, our suffering brethren. When the measure of their tears\r\n     shall be full, when their groans shall have involved heaven\r\n     itself in darkness, doubtless a God of justice will awaken to\r\n     their distress, and by diffusing light and liberality among their\r\n     oppressors, or, at length, by His exterminating thunder, manifest\r\n     His attention to the things of this world, and that they are not\r\n     left to the guidance of a blind fatality.[97]\r\n\r\nJefferson, however, seemed to have a kind feeling for the bondmen, as\r\nthese extracts will show.\r\n\r\n     I observe in your letter ... that the profits of the whole estate\r\n     (of Monticello) would be no more than the hire of the few negroes\r\n     hired out would amount to. Would it be better to hire more where\r\n     good masters could be got? Would it be better to hire plantations\r\n     and all, if proper assurance can be provided for the good usage,\r\n     of everything?[98]\r\n\r\n     I am miserable till I shall owe not a shilling. The moment that\r\n     shall be the case, I shall feel myself at liberty to do something\r\n     for the comfort of the slaves.[99]\r\n\r\n     The check on the tenants against abusing my slaves was, by the\r\n     former lease, that I might discontinue it on a reference to\r\n     arbitrators. Would it not be well to retain an optional right to\r\n     sue them for ill-usage of the slaves or to discontinue it by\r\n     arbitration, whichever you should choose at the time?[100]\r\n\r\n     As far as I can judge from the experiments which have been made\r\n     to give liberty to, or rather, to abandon persons whose habits\r\n     have been formed in slavery is like abandoning children.[101]\r\n\r\n     I am decided on my final return to America to try this\r\n     experiment. I shall endeavor to import as many Germans as I have\r\n     grown slaves. I will settle them and my slaves, on farms of fifty\r\n     acres each, intermingled, and place all on the footing of the\r\n     Metayers (Medietaini) of Europe. Their children shall be brought\r\n     up, as others are, in habits of property and foresight, and I\r\n     have no doubt but that they will be good citizens. Some of their\r\n     fathers will be so; others I suppose will need government. With\r\n     these all that can be done is to oblige them to labor as the\r\n     laboring poor of Europe do, and to apply to their comfortable\r\n     subsistence the produce of their labor, retaining such a moderate\r\n     portion of it as may be a just equivalent for the use of the\r\n     lands they labor, and the stocks and other necessary\r\n     advances.[102]\r\n\r\n     The inculcation (in your book) on the master of the moral duties\r\n     which he owes to the slave, in return for the benefits of his\r\n     service, that is to say, of food, clothing, care in sickness, and\r\n     maintenance under age and disability, so as to make him in fact\r\n     as comfortable and more secure than the laboring man in most\r\n     parts of the world, ... gives great merit to the work, and will,\r\n     I have no doubt, produce wholesome impressions.[103]\r\n\r\n     In the first or second session of the Legislature after I became\r\n     a member, I drew to this subject the attention of Colonel Bland,\r\n     one of the oldest, ablest, and most respected members, and he\r\n     undertook to move for certain moderate extensions of the\r\n     protection of the laws to these people. I seconded his motion\r\n     and, as a young member, was more spared in the debate; but he was\r\n     denounced as an enemy of his country, and was treated with the\r\n     grossest indecorum.[104]\r\n\r\n     My opinion has ever been that, until more can be done for them,\r\n     we should endeavor, with those whom fortune has thrown on our\r\n     hands, to feed and clothe them well, protect them from ill usage,\r\n     require such reasonable labor only as is performed voluntarily by\r\n     freemen, and be led by no repugnances to abdicate them, and our\r\n     duties to them. The laws do not permit us to turn them loose, if\r\n     that were for their good; and to commute them for other property\r\n     is to commit them to those whose usage of them we cannot\r\n     control.[105]\r\n\r\nJefferson was opposed to slavery, but he hesitated to take certain\r\nsteps against it because of public opinion.\r\n\r\n     I am very sensible of the honor you propose to me of becoming a\r\n     member of the society for the abolition of the slave trade. You\r\n     know that nobody wishes more ardently to see an abolition, not\r\n     only of the trade, but of the condition of slavery; and certainly\r\n     nobody will be more willing to encounter every sacrifice for that\r\n     object. But the influence and information of the friends to this\r\n     proposition in France will be far above the need of my\r\n     association. I am here as a public servant, and those whom I\r\n     serve, having never yet been able to give their voice against\r\n     this practice, it is decent for me to avoid too public a\r\n     demonstration of my wishes to see it abolished. Without serving\r\n     the cause here, it might render me less able to serve it beyond\r\n     the water. I trust you will be sensible of the prudence of those\r\n     motives, therefore, which govern my conduct on this\r\n     occasion.[106]\r\n\r\n     I have received a letter from Mr. Thomas Brannagan, ...\r\n     Philadelphia, asking my subscription to the work announced in the\r\n     enclosed paper.[107] The cause in which he embarks is so holy,\r\n     the sentiments he expresses in his letter so friendly, that it is\r\n     highly painful to me to hesitate on a compliance which appears so\r\n     small. But that is not its true character, and it would be\r\n     injurious even to his views, for me to commit myself on paper by\r\n     answering his letter. I have most carefully avoided every public\r\n     act of manifestation on that subject. Should an occasion ever\r\n     occur in which I can interpose with decisive effect, I shall\r\n     certainly know and do my duty with promptitude and zeal. But, in\r\n     the meantime, it would only be disarming myself of influence to\r\n     be taking small means. The subscription to a book on this subject\r\n     is one of those little irritating measures, which, without\r\n     advancing its end at all, would, by lessening the confidence and\r\n     good will of a description of friends composing a large body,\r\n     only lessen my powers of doing them good in the other great\r\n     relations in which I stand to the public. Yet, I cannot be easy\r\n     in not answering Mr. Brannagan's letter, unless he can be made\r\n     sensible that it is better I should not answer it; and I do not\r\n     know how to effect this, unless you would have the goodness ...\r\n     to enter into an explanation with him.[108]\r\n\r\n     We have received with great satisfaction notification of the\r\n     orders of his Catholic Majesty, not to permit that persons, held\r\n     in slavery within the United States, introduce themselves as free\r\n     persons into the Province of Florida.... As a consequence of the\r\n     same principles of justice and friendship, we trust that your\r\n     Excellency will permit, and aid the recovery of persons of the\r\n     same description, who have heretofore taken refuge within your\r\n     government.[109]\r\n\r\n     The governor of East Florida informs me that he has received the\r\n     King's orders, not to permit, under any pretext, that persons\r\n     held in slavery in the United States introduce themselves as\r\n     free, into the province of East Florida. I am happy that this\r\n     grievance, which had been a subject of great complaint from the\r\n     citizens of Georgia, is to be removed.[110]\r\n\r\nJefferson thought that the Negro republics of the West Indies would\r\nbecome a safety valve for the United States.\r\n\r\n     I become daily more convinced that all the West India Islands\r\n     will remain in the hands of the people of color, and a total\r\n     expulsion of the whites sooner or later take place. It is high\r\n     time we should foresee the bloody scenes which our children\r\n     certainly, and possibly ourselves (south of the Potomac), have to\r\n     wade through and try to avert them.[111]\r\n\r\n     If something is not done, and soon done, we shall be the\r\n     murderers of our own children. The \"_murmura venturos nautis\r\n     prudentia ventos_\" has already reached us (from San Domingo); the\r\n     revolutionary storm, now sweeping the globe, will be upon us, and\r\n     happy if we make timely provision to give it an easy passage over\r\n     our land. From the present state of things in Europe and America,\r\n     the day which begins our combustion must be near at hand; and\r\n     only a single spark is wanting to make that day to-morrow. If we\r\n     had begun sooner, we might probably have been allowed a lengthier\r\n     operation to clear ourselves, but every day's delay lessens the\r\n     time we may take for emancipation. Some people derive hope from\r\n     the aid of the confederate States. But this is a delusion. There\r\n     is but one State in the Union which will aid us sincerely, if an\r\n     insurrection begins, and that one may, perhaps, have its own fire\r\n     to quench at the same time.[112]\r\n\r\n     As to the mode of emancipation, I am satisfied that that must be\r\n     a matter of compromise between the passions, the prejudices, and\r\n     the real difficulties which will each have its weight in that\r\n     operation. Perhaps the first chapter of this history, which has\r\n     begun in St. Domingo, and the next succeeding ones, will recount\r\n     how all the whites were driven from all the other islands, may\r\n     prepare our minds for a peaceable accommodation between justice,\r\n     policy and necessity; and furnish an answer to the difficult\r\n     question, whither shall the colored emigrants go? and the sooner\r\n     we put some plan under way, the greater hope there is that it may\r\n     be permitted to proceed peaceably to its ultimate effect.[113]\r\n\r\nJefferson finally despaired of seeing his emancipation scheme succeed.\r\n\r\n     I have long since given up the expectation of any early provision\r\n     for the extinguishment of slavery among us. There are many\r\n     virtuous men who would make any sacrifices to effect it, many\r\n     equally virtuous who persuade themselves either that the thing is\r\n     not wrong, or that it cannot be remedied, and very many with whom\r\n     interest is morality. The older we grow, the larger we are\r\n     disposed to believe the last party to be. But interest is really\r\n     going over to the side of morality. The value of the slave is\r\n     every day lessening; his burden on his master daily increasing.\r\n     Interest is, therefore, preparing the disposition to be just; and\r\n     this will be goaded from time to time by the insurrectionary\r\n     spirit of the slaves. This is easily quelled in its first\r\n     efforts; but from being local it will become general, and\r\n     whenever it does, it will rise more formidable after every\r\n     defeat, until we shall be forced, after dreadful scenes and\r\n     sufferings, to release them in their own way, which, without such\r\n     sufferings we might now model after our own convenience.[114]\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nBecause of frequent insurrections in this country and the West Indies\r\nthere was much talk of establishing a penal colony to which the\r\nleaders of such uprisings could be sent. With Gabriel's insurrection\r\nin Virginia in 1800 in mind, James Monroe, then Governor of Virginia,\r\nwrote Jefferson, asking him to support such a project, a resolution on\r\nwhich had already passed the Virginia House of Delegates. Jefferson\r\nwrote him the following:\r\n\r\n     Questions would arise whether the establishment of a (negro\r\n     penal) colony within our limits, and to become a part of our\r\n     Union, would be desirable to the State of Virginia itself, or to\r\n     other States--especially those who would be in its vicinity.\r\n     Could we procure lands beyond the limits of the United States to\r\n     form a receptacle for these people? On our northern boundary, the\r\n     country not occupied by British subjects, is the property of\r\n     Indian nations, whose title would have to be extinguished, with\r\n     the consent of Great Britain; and the new settlers would be\r\n     British subjects. It is hardly to be believed that either Great\r\n     Britain or the Indian proprietors have so disinterested a regard\r\n     for us, as to be willing to relieve us, by receiving such a\r\n     colony themselves.... On our western and southern frontiers,\r\n     Spain holds an immense country, the occupancy of which, however,\r\n     is in the Indian natives, except a few insulated spots possessed\r\n     by Spanish subjects. It is very questionable, indeed, whether the\r\n     Indians would sell? whether Spain would be willing to receive\r\n     these people? and nearly certain that she would not alienate the\r\n     sovereignty. The same question to ourselves would recur here\r\n     also, as did in the first case: should we be willing to have such\r\n     a colony in contact with us? However our present interests may\r\n     restrain us within our own limits, it is impossible not to look\r\n     forward to distant times, when our rapid multiplication will\r\n     expand itself beyond those limits, and cover the whole northern,\r\n     if not the southern continent, with a people speaking the same\r\n     language, governed in similar forms, and by similar laws; nor can\r\n     we contemplate with satisfaction either blot or mixture on that\r\n     surface. Spain, France, and Portugal hold possessions on the\r\n     southern continent, as to which I am not well enough informed to\r\n     say how far they might meet our views. But either there or in the\r\n     northern continent, should the constituted authorities ties of\r\n     Virginia fix their attention, of preference, I will have the\r\n     dispositions of those powers sounded in the first instance.[115]\r\n\r\nWriting to Rufus King in 1802 Jefferson discussed in detail the\r\nfeasibility of the plan.\r\n\r\n     As the expense of so distant a transportation would be very\r\n     heavy, and might weigh unfavorably in deciding between the modes\r\n     of punishment, it is very desirable that it should be lessened as\r\n     much as is practicable. If the regulations of the place would\r\n     permit these emigrants to dispose of themselves, as the Germans\r\n     and others do who come to this country poor, by giving their\r\n     labor for a certain time to some one who will pay their passage;\r\n     and if the master of the vessel could be permitted to carry\r\n     articles of commerce from this country and take back others from\r\n     that, which might yield him a mercantile profit sufficient to\r\n     cover the expenses of the voyage, a serious difficulty would be\r\n     removed.[116]\r\n\r\n     The course of things in the ... West Indies appears to have given\r\n     a considerable impulse to the minds of the slaves in ... the\r\n     United States. A great disposition to insurgency has manifested\r\n     itself among them, which, in one instance, in the State of\r\n     Virginia, broke out into actual insurrection. This was easily\r\n     suppressed; but many of those concerned (between twenty and\r\n     thirty, I believe) fell victims to the law. So extensive an\r\n     execution could not but excite sensibility in the public mind,\r\n     and beget a regret that the laws had not provided for such cases,\r\n     some alternative, combining more mildness with equal efficiency.\r\n     The Legislature of the State ... took the subject into\r\n     consideration, and have communicated to me through the Governor\r\n     of the State, their wish that some place could be provided, out\r\n     of the limits of the United States, to which slaves guilty of\r\n     insurgency might be transported; and they have particularly\r\n     looked to Africa as offering the most desirable receptacle. We\r\n     might, for this purpose, enter into negotiations with the\r\n     natives, on some part of the coast, to obtain a settlement; and,\r\n     by establishing an African company, combine with it commercial\r\n     operations, which might not only reimburse expenses, but procure\r\n     profit also. But there being already such an establishment on\r\n     that coast by the English Sierra Leone Company, made for the\r\n     express purpose of colonizing civilized blacks to that country,\r\n     it would seem better, by incorporating our emigrants with\r\n     theirs, to make one strong, rather than two weak colonies. This\r\n     would be the more desirable because the blacks settled at Sierra\r\n     Leone, having chiefly gone from the States, would often receive\r\n     among those whom we should send, their acquaintances and\r\n     relatives. The object of this letter is to ask ... you to enter\r\n     into conference with such persons, private and public, as would\r\n     be necessary to give us permission to send thither the persons\r\n     under contemplation.... They are not felons, or common\r\n     malefactors, but persons guilty of what the safety of society,\r\n     under actual circumstances, obliges us to treat as a crime, but\r\n     which their feelings may represent in a far different shape. They\r\n     will be a valuable acquisition to the settlement, ... and well\r\n     calculated to cooperate in the plan of civilization.\r\n\r\n     ... The consequences of permitting emancipation to become\r\n     extensive, unless a condition of emigration be annexed to them,\r\n     furnish matter of solicitude to the Legislature of Virginia.\r\n     Although provision for the settlement of emancipated negroes\r\n     might perhaps be obtained nearer home than Africa, yet it is\r\n     desirable that we should be free to expatriate this description\r\n     of people also to the colony of Sierra Leone, if considerations\r\n     respecting either themselves or us should render it more\r\n     expedient. I pray you, therefore, to get the same permission\r\n     extended to the reception of these as well as the (insurgents).\r\n     Nor will there be a selection of bad subjects; the emancipations,\r\n     for the most part, being either of the whole slaves of the\r\n     master, or of such individuals as have particularly deserved\r\n     well. The latter are most frequent.[117]\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nHe was firm to the end in his effort to abolish the slave trade.\r\n\r\n     Whatever may have been the circumstances which influenced our\r\n     forefathers to permit the introduction of personal bondage into\r\n     any part of these States, and to participate in the wrongs\r\n     committed on an unoffending quarter of the globe, we may rejoice\r\n     that such circumstances, and such a sense of them, exist no\r\n     longer. It is honorable to the nation at large that their\r\n     Legislature availed themselves of the first practicable moment\r\n     for arresting the progress of this great moral and political\r\n     error.[118]\r\n\r\n     I congratulate you (Congress) on the approach of the period at\r\n     which you may interpose your authority constitutionally, to\r\n     withdraw the citizens of the United States from all further\r\n     participation in those violations of human rights which have been\r\n     so long continued on the unoffending inhabitants of Africa, and\r\n     which the morality, the reputation, and the best interests of our\r\n     country, have long been eager to proscribe. Although no law you\r\n     may pass can take prohibitory effect till the first day of the\r\n     year one thousand eight hundred and eight, yet the intervening\r\n     period is not too long to prevent, by timely notice, expeditions\r\n     which cannot be completed before that day.[119]--Sixth Annual\r\n     Message.\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nIn his old age Jefferson became decidedly less radical in his advocacy\r\nof abolition, contenting himself with the utterances of the nature of\r\nan academic deprecation of the evil, expressing the hope that in some\r\nway it might be eradicated, but at the same time despairing of it.\r\nWriting to Edward Coles, he said:\r\n\r\n     My sentiment on the subject of slavery of negroes have long since\r\n     been in possession of the public, and time has only served to\r\n     give them stronger root. The love of justice and the love of\r\n     country plead equally the cause of these people, and it is a\r\n     moral reproach to us that they should have pleaded it so long in\r\n     vain, and should have produced not a single effort, nay I fear\r\n     not much serious willingness to relieve them and ourselves from\r\n     our present condition of moral and political reprobation.... I\r\n     had always hoped that the younger generation receiving their\r\n     early impressions after the flame of liberty had been kindled in\r\n     every breast, and had become, as it were, the vital spirit of\r\n     every American, that the generous temperament of youth, analogous\r\n     to the motion of the blood, and above the suggestions of avarice,\r\n     would have sympathized with oppression wherever found, and proved\r\n     their love of liberty beyond their own share of it. But my\r\n     intercourse with them since my return (from Europe) has not been\r\n     sufficient to ascertain that they had made towards this point the\r\n     progress I had hoped.[120]\r\n\r\n     The hour of emancipation is advancing, in the march of time. It\r\n     will come; and whether brought on by the generous energy of our\r\n     own minds; or by the bloody process of St. Domingo, excited and\r\n     conducted by the power of our present enemy (England), if once\r\n     stationed permanently within our country, and offering asylum and\r\n     arms to the oppressed, is a leaf of our history not yet turned\r\n     over.[121]\r\n\r\n     From those of the former generation who were in the fulness of\r\n     age when I came into public life, which was while our controversy\r\n     with England was on paper only, I soon saw that nothing was to be\r\n     hoped. Nursed and educated in the daily habit of seeing the\r\n     degraded condition, both bodily and mental, of those unfortunate\r\n     beings, not reflecting that that degradation was very much the\r\n     work of themselves and their fathers, few minds have yet doubted\r\n     but that they were as legitimate subjects of property as their\r\n     horses and cattle. The quiet and monotonous course of colonial\r\n     life had been disturbed by no alarm, and little reflection on the\r\n     value of liberty. And when alarm was taken at an enterprise on\r\n     their own, it was not easy to carry them to the whole length of\r\n     the principles which they invoked for themselves.[122]\r\n\r\n     As to the method by which this difficult work is to be effected,\r\n     if permitted to be done by ourselves, I have seen no proposition\r\n     so expedient on the whole, as that of emancipation of those born\r\n     after a given day, and of their education and expatriation after\r\n     a given age.[123]\r\n\r\n     I hope you will reconcile yourself to your country and its\r\n     unfortunate condition; that you will not lessen its stock of\r\n     sound disposition by withdrawing your portion from the mass;\r\n     that, on the contrary, you will come forward in the public\r\n     councils, become the missionary of this doctrine truly Christian,\r\n     insinuate and inculcate it softly but steadily, through the\r\n     medium of writing and conversation; associate others in your\r\n     labors, and when the phalanx is formed, bring on the press the\r\n     proposition perseveringly until its accomplishment.[124]\r\n\r\nWriting to David Barrow in 1815 about the preparation of slaves for\r\nemancipation, Jefferson said:\r\n\r\n     Unhappily it is a case for which both parties require long and\r\n     difficult preparation. The mind of the master is to be apprized\r\n     by reflection, and strengthened by the energies of conscience,\r\n     against the obstacles of self interest to an acquiescence in the\r\n     rights of others; that of the slave is to be prepared by\r\n     instruction and habit for self-government, and for the honest\r\n     pursuits of industry and social duty. Both of these courses of\r\n     preparation require time, and the former must precede the latter.\r\n     Some progress is sensibly made in it; yet not so much as I had\r\n     hoped and expected. But it will yield in time to temperate and\r\n     steady pursuit, to the enlargement of the human mind, and its\r\n     advancement in science. We are not in a world ungoverned by the\r\n     laws and the power of a Superior Agent. Our efforts are in His\r\n     hand, and directed by it; and He will give them their effect in\r\n     his own time. Where the disease is most deeply seated, there it\r\n     will be slowest in eradication. In the Northern States it was\r\n     merely superficial, and easily corrected. In the Southern it is\r\n     incorporated with the whole system, and requires time, patience\r\n     and perseverance in the curative process. That it may finally be\r\n     effected, and its process hastened, will be my last and fondest\r\n     prayer.[125]\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Dr. Thomas Humphreys in 1817, Jefferson expressed fear\r\nabout the purchase of slaves by the United States.\r\n\r\n     The bare proposition of purchase (of the slaves) by the United\r\n     States generally would excite infinite indignation in all the\r\n     States north of Maryland. The sacrifice must fall on the States\r\n     alone which hold them; and the difficult question will be how to\r\n     lessen this so as to reconcile our fellow citizens to it.\r\n     Personally, I am ready and desirous to make any sacrifice which\r\n     shall ensure their gradual but complete retirement from the\r\n     State, and effectually, at the same time, establish them\r\n     elsewhere in freedom and safety.[126]\r\n\r\n     I concur entirely in your leading principles of gradual\r\n     emancipation, of establishment on the coast of Africa, and the\r\n     patronage of our nation until the emigrants shall be able to\r\n     protect themselves.[127]\r\n\r\nJefferson saw in the extension of slavery that which had given the\r\ninstitution a new aspect in lessening the difficulty by dividing it.\r\n\r\n     I can say with conscious truth that there is not a man on earth\r\n     who would sacrifice more than I would to relieve us from this\r\n     heavy reproach in any _practicable_ way. The cession of that kind\r\n     of property, for so it is misnamed, is a bagatelle which would\r\n     not cost me a second thought, if, in that way, a general\r\n     emancipation and _expatriation_ could be effected; and,\r\n     gradually, and with due sacrifices, I think it might be. But, as\r\n     it is, we have the wolf by the ears, and we can neither hold him,\r\n     nor safely let him go. Justice is in the one scale and\r\n     self-preservation in the other.[128]\r\n\r\n     Of one thing I am certain, that as the passage of slaves from one\r\n     State to another, would not make a slave of a single human being\r\n     who would not be so without it, so their diffusion over a greater\r\n     surface would make them individually happier, and proportionally\r\n     facilitate the accomplishment of their emancipation, by dividing\r\n     the burden on a greater number of coadjutors. An abstinence, too,\r\n     from this act of power would remove the jealousy excited by the\r\n     undertaking of Congress to regulate the condition of the\r\n     different descriptions of men composing a State, which nothing in\r\n     the Constitution has taken from them and given to the General\r\n     Government. Could Congress, for example, say that the non-freemen\r\n     of Connecticut shall be freemen, or that they shall not emigrate\r\n     into any other State?[129]\r\n\r\nDuring the closing years of his life he expressed little hope of\r\nseeing his plan of gradual emancipation carried out.\r\n\r\n     It was found that the public mind would not bear the proposition\r\n     (gradual emancipation), nor will it bear it even at this day\r\n     (1821). Yet the day is not distant when it must bear and adopt\r\n     it, or worse will follow. Nothing is more certainly written in\r\n     the book of fate, than that these people are to be free; nor is\r\n     it less certain, that the two races, equally free, cannot live in\r\n     the same government. Nature, habit, opinion have drawn indelible\r\n     lines of distinction between them. It is still in our power to\r\n     direct the process of emancipation and deportation, peaceably,\r\n     and in such slow degree, as that the evil will wear off\r\n     insensible, and their place be, _pari passu_, filled up by free\r\n     white laborers. If, on the contrary, it is left to force itself\r\n     on, human nature must shudder at the prospect held up. We should\r\n     in vain look for an example in the Spanish deportation, or\r\n     deletion of the Moors. This precedent would fall far short of our\r\n     case.[130]\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     In 1769, I became a member of the legislature by the choice of\r\n     the country in which I live (Albemarle), and so continued until\r\n     it was closed by the Revolution. I made one effort in that body\r\n     for the permission of the emancipation of slaves, which was\r\n     rejected; and indeed, during the regal government, nothing\r\n     liberal could expect success. Our minds were circumscribed within\r\n     narrow limits, by an habitual belief that it was our duty to be\r\n     subordinate to the mother country in all matters of government,\r\n     to direct all our labors in subservience to her interests, and\r\n     even to observe a bigoted intolerance for all religions but hers.\r\n     The difficulties with our representatives were of habit and\r\n     despair, not of reflection and conviction. Experience soon proved\r\n     that they could bring their minds to rights on the first summons\r\n     of their attention. But the King's Council, which acted as\r\n     another house of legislature, held their places at will, and were\r\n     in most humble obedience to that will; the Governor, too, who had\r\n     a negative on our laws, held by the same tenure, and with still\r\n     greater devotedness to it; and, last of all, the royal negative\r\n     closed the last door to every hope of\r\n     ameloration.--Autobiography.[131]\r\n\r\n     The first establishment (of slavery) in Virginia which became\r\n     permanent, was made in 1607. I have found no mention of negroes\r\n     in the Colony until about 1650. The first brought here as slaves\r\n     were by a Dutch ship; after which the English commenced the\r\n     trade, and continued it until the Revolutionary war. That\r\n     suspended, _ipso facto_, their further importation for the\r\n     present, and the business of the war pressing constantly on the\r\n     legislature, this subject was not acted on finally until the year\r\n     '78, when I brought in a bill to prevent their further\r\n     importation. This passed without opposition, and stopped the\r\n     increase of the evil by importation, leaving to future efforts\r\n     its final eradication.--Autobiography.[132]\r\n\r\n     Our only blot is becoming less offensive by the great improvement\r\n     in the condition and civilization of that race, who can now more\r\n     advantageously compare their situation with that of the laborers\r\n     of Europe. Still it is a hideous blot, as well from the\r\n     heteromorph peculiarities of the race, as that, with them,\r\n     physical compulsion to action must be substituted for the moral\r\n     necessity which constrains the free laborers to work equally\r\n     hard. We feel and deplore it morally and politically, and we look\r\n     without entire despair to some redeeming means not yet\r\n     specifically foreseen. I am happy in believing that the\r\n     conviction of the necessity of removing this evil gains ground\r\n     with time. Their emigration to the westward lightens the\r\n     difficulty by dividing it, and renders it more practicable on the\r\n     whole. And the neighborhood of a government of their color\r\n     promises a more accessible asylum than that from whence they\r\n     came.[133]\r\n\r\nShowing the difficulty of purchase in case of the adoption of the\r\npolicy, Jefferson wrote Jared Sparks in 1824:\r\n\r\n     Actual property has been lawfully vested in that form (negroes)\r\n     and who can lawfully take it from the possessors?[134]\r\n\r\n     Who would estimate its blessed effects? I leave this to those who\r\n     will live to see their accomplishment, and to enjoy a beatitude\r\n     forbidden to my age. But I leave it with this admonition,--to\r\n     rise and be doing. A million and a half are within our control;\r\n     but six millions (which a majority of those now living will see\r\n     them attain), and one million of these fighting men, will say,\r\n     \"we will not go.\"[135]\r\n\r\n     The separation of infants from their mothers would produce some\r\n     scruples of humanity. But this would be straining at a gnat, and\r\n     swallowing a camel.[136]\r\n\r\nJefferson became interested in the schemes of Miss Fanny Wright, who\r\nwas endeavoring to promote gradual emancipation through an\r\nEmancipating Labor Society. He wrote her in 1825:\r\n\r\n     The abolition of the evil is not impossible; it ought never,\r\n     therefore, to be despaired of. Every plan should be adopted,\r\n     every experiment tried, which may do something towards the\r\n     ultimate object. That which you propose is well worthy of trial.\r\n     It has succeeded with certain portions of our white brethren,\r\n     under the care of a Rapp and an Owen; and why may it not succeed\r\n     with the man of color?\r\n\r\n     At the age of eighty-two, with one foot in the grave and the\r\n     other uplifted to follow it, I do not permit myself to take part\r\n     in any new enterprises, even for bettering the condition of man,\r\n     not even in the great one which is the subject of your letter,\r\n     and which has been through life that of my greatest\r\n     anxieties.[137] The march of events has not been such as to\r\n     render its completion practicable within the limits of time\r\n     allotted to me; and I leave its accomplishment as the work of\r\n     another generation.[138]\r\n\r\nAlthough Jefferson lost hope of seeing his plans carried out, this\r\nletter to Edward Everett, written near the close of his career, shows\r\nthat he had not changed his attitude.\r\n\r\n     On the question of the lawfulness of slavery, that is of the\r\n     right of one man to appropriate to himself the faculties of\r\n     another without his consent, I certainly retain my early\r\n     opinions.

To this end he\r\npersuaded a little boy of his master's to teach him the letters of the\r\nalphabet. He was discovered in the act and whipped. His curiosity,\r\nhowever, to learn the secret, which was locked up in those mysterious\r\ncharacters, was only increased, and he was detected in another\r\nattempt, and accordingly chastised. By this time he had so far\r\npenetrated the secret that nothing could deter him from further\r\neffort. A third time he was detected, and whipped almost to death.\r\nStill he persevered; and then to keep the matter secret, if possible,\r\nhe crept into a hogshead, which lay in a rather retired place and\r\nleaving just hole enough to let in a little light, he sat there on a\r\nlittle straw, and thus prosecuted his object. He knew he must be\r\nwhipped for being absent; and he often had to lie to conceal the\r\ncause; but such were the strivings of his noble nature, such his\r\nirrepressible longings after the hidden treasures of knowledge, that\r\nnothing could subdue them, and he accomplished his purpose.[140]\r\n\r\nEDWARD MITCHELL, a colored man, was brought from the South by\r\nPresident Brown of Dartmouth College. He soon indicated a desire for\r\nmental culture on being brought within its influence at college. At\r\nfirst there was some hesitation about admitting him as the children of\r\nsoutherners sometimes attended Dartmouth and one of them had recently\r\ninstructed his son to withdraw should the institution admit a Negro to\r\nhis classes. Mitchell was prepared for entering the Freshman class,\r\nwas received as a regular student and was promoted through all other\r\nclasses to a full honorable graduation. He was uniformly treated with\r\nrespect by his fellow students throughout his collegiate career. Upon\r\ngraduating in 1828 he was settled as a pastor of a Baptist church in\r\nthe State of Vermont, where he rendered creditable service.[141]\r\n\r\nLUKE MULBER came to Steubenville, Ohio, in 1802, hired himself to a\r\ncarpenter during the summer at ten dollars a month, and went to school\r\nin the winter. This course he pursued for three years, at the\r\nexpiration of which he had learned to do rough carpenter work.\r\nIndustry and economy crowned his labors with success. In 1837 he was a\r\ncontractor hiring four or five journeymen, two of whom were his sons,\r\nhaving calls for more work than they could do. He lived in a fine\r\nbrick house which he had built for himself on Fourth Street, valued at\r\ntwo thousand five hundred dollars and owned other property in the\r\ncity. Persons who came into contact with Mulber found him a quiet,\r\nhumble, Christian man, possessing those characteristics expected of a\r\nuseful member of society.[142]\r\n\r\nSAMUEL MARTIN, a man of color, and the oldest resident of Port Gibson,\r\nMississippi, emancipated six of his slaves in 1844, bringing them to\r\nCincinnati where he believed they would have a better opportunity to\r\nstart life anew. These were two mulatto women with their four quadroon\r\nchildren, the color of whom well illustrated the moral condition of\r\nthat State, in that each child had a different father and they\r\nretained few marks of their partial African descent. Mr. Martin was\r\nhimself a slave until 1829. He purchased his freedom for a large sum\r\nmost of which he earned by taking time from sleep for work. Thereafter\r\nhe acquired considerable property. He was not a slaveholder in the\r\nsouthern sense of that word. His purpose was to purchase his fellowmen\r\nin bondage that he might give them an opportunity to become\r\nfree.[143]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[140] _The Philanthropist_, July 28, 1837.\r\n\r\n[141] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[142] _The Philanthropist_, June 2, 1837.\r\n\r\n[143] _Cincinnati Morning Herald_, June 1, 1844.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK REVIEWS\r\n\r\n\r\n_Negro Education, A Study of Private and Higher Schools for Colored\r\nPeople in the United States._ By THOMAS JESSE JONES. United States\r\nBureau of Education in Cooperation with the Phelps-Stokes Fund. Issued\r\nas Bulletins, 1916, Nos. 38 and 39. Government Printing Office,\r\nWashington, 1917. Vol. I, pp. 700. Vol. II, pp. 700.\r\n\r\nThis report is the result of a survey of Negro education made during\r\nthe past four years under the direction of Dr. Thomas Jesse Jones,\r\nspecialist in the education of racial groups, United States Bureau of\r\nEducation. This is the most comprehensive and authoritative report\r\nrelating to Negro education that has been made. The report covers all\r\nNegro private schools above the elementary grades. The total number of\r\nschools described is 748, of which 635 are private schools, 28 are\r\nstate institutions, 68 are public high schools, and 27 are county\r\ntraining schools. Reports are also made on 43 special institutions\r\nsuch as hospitals, orphanages and reformatories.\r\n\r\nIt appears that no form of education for Negroes is satisfactorily\r\nequipped or supported. The striking facts in the study of the\r\nfinancial support of Negro education are, first, the wide divergencies\r\nin the per capita of public school expenditures for white and Negro\r\nchildren: $10.06 for each white child and $2.89 for each Negro child,\r\nand second, the extent to which schools for Negroes are dependent upon\r\nprivate aid. It also appears that the private schools provide the\r\ngreater proportion of all educational opportunities above the\r\nelementary grades. They also offer practically all the instruction in\r\nagriculture, medicine and religion.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion of a program for educational development, it is\r\npointed out that the public school authorities are responsible for\r\nelementary education and that so long as the elementary school\r\nfacilities are insufficient, every phase of education above the\r\nelementary grades is seriously handicapped. With reference to\r\nsecondary schools and teacher training, it is suggested that their\r\nchief effort should be to supply trained teachers for the public\r\nelementary schools. More than fifty per cent. of the teachers now in\r\nthese schools have an education less than the equivalent of six\r\nelementary grades.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion of the importance of industrial education, it is\r\npointed out that in spite of the striking progress made in the\r\naccumulation of property, the Negroes are \"still a poor people.\" The\r\nlarge percentage of women and children who have to earn a living\r\nindicates the need of elevating their economic status so that more\r\nchildren may attend school, and the women have a better opportunity to\r\ncare for the morals and hygiene of the home. Because three fourths of\r\nthe Negroes live in rural districts, instruction along agricultural\r\nlines is one of the most important phases of Negro education.\r\n\"Preparation for rural life,\" says the report, \"is the greatest\r\nproblem of the white and colored people of the South.\"\r\n\r\nThe most radical recommendations made in the report are those relating\r\nto higher education. These recommendations are along the line of\r\nimproving the facilities and raising the standards of Negro college\r\nwork. The schools teaching subjects of college grade, 33 in number,\r\nare classified according to the amount of college work done, into\r\nthree groups: first, colleges; second, those doing secondary and\r\ncollege work; and third, those schools in which some college work is\r\noffered. \"Only three institutions, Howard, Fisk, and Meharry Medical,\r\nhave a student body, a teaching force and equipment, and an income\r\nsufficient to warrant the characterization of college. Nearly half of\r\nthe college students and practically all of the professional students\r\nare in these three institutions.\" It is suggested that there should be\r\nconcentration on the development for Negroes of two institutions of\r\nuniversity grade. Howard and Fisk are suggested as these two\r\ninstitutions. It is recommended that three institutions be developed\r\nand maintained as first class colleges. One such institution would be\r\nlocated at Richmond, Virginia; one at Atlanta, Georgia, and one at\r\nMarshall, Texas. A number of other institutions would be developed\r\ninto junior colleges or schools doing two years of college work. In\r\nthese junior colleges, large provision would be made for the training\r\nof teachers.\r\n\r\n                                   M. N.

Revista\r\nBimestere Cubana, Havana, 1916. Pp. 536.\r\n\r\nThis work, as its title signifies, is a monograph intended to show the\r\nworking out of the problems of enslaving the blacks in Cuba. The\r\nstudy begins with a description of the life of Cuba as conducive to\r\nthe introduction of slavery and then that of the blacks themselves.\r\nAlthough acknowledging the difficulty of making an ethnographic study\r\nof the imported Africans, the author endeavors to trace the origin of\r\nthese slaves to their native regions in Africa to determine the traits\r\nwhich entered into the formation of the character of the Cuban slaves.\r\nHe then connects the institution with the sugar industry, which\r\nincreased the demand for slaves, gave the institution an economic\r\naspect and made the slave trade an international concern of great\r\nmoment. The movement for the amelioration of the condition of the\r\nslave and the early efforts at abolition are noted only to show that\r\nthese efforts proved to be insignificant when the traffic became\r\nuniversal and the institution reached the economic stage in the sugar\r\ncolonies. The atrocities incident to the methods of the victors in the\r\ntribal wars of Africa supplying the traders frequenting the coast are\r\nduly treated. The author even gives in detail the procedure, prices\r\nand numbers.\r\n\r\nA considerable portion of the book is concerned with the real life of\r\nthe slave. Professor Ortiz believes that the punishments inflicted in\r\nCuba were not so severe as in some other countries. He discusses the\r\nwork done by the men, women and children, their habitations, food,\r\ndress and diversions. The diseases of the slave arising in adjusting\r\nthemselves to the new world are also noted. Going further into the\r\ndetails of the life of the slaves, the author describes the urban\r\nNegroes and distinguishes this class of the bondmen from those of the\r\nplantation. He then discusses the free Negroes, who even from an early\r\nperiod constituted a considerable element of the black population and\r\nexplains why some of them returned to Africa. The rights of all of the\r\nelements of the black population at law are mentioned so as to give\r\nthe reader an idea of the black code as enforced in that island. How\r\nthese classes thus kept down were moved from time to time to organize\r\ninsurrections to secure their freedom, constitutes one of the chapters\r\nof the book.\r\n\r\nOn the whole it cannot be said that Professor Ortiz has shown that\r\nslavery in Cuba differed widely from what it was in some other large\r\nislands of the West Indies. He has, however, made a contribution to\r\nscholarship in showing exactly how this institution affected the life\r\nand the development of Cuba. The work is well illustrated and has an\r\nappendix of valuable documents bearing on slavery in Cuba.\r\n\r\n                                   C. G. WOODSON.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_A Social History of the American Family, from Colonial Times to the\r\nPresent._ By ARTHUR W. CALHOUN, PH.D. Volume I, Colonial Period. The\r\nArthur H. Clark Company, Cleveland, U. S. A., 1917. Pp. 348.\r\n\r\nThis work is a study in genetic sociology to be completed in three\r\nvolumes. The purpose of it is to develop an understanding of the\r\nforces that have been operative in the evolution of the family\r\ninstitution in the United States. The author will endeavor to set\r\nforth the influences that have shaped marriage, controlled fecundity,\r\ndetermined the respective status of father, mother, child, attracted\r\nrelative and servant, influenced sexual morality and governed the\r\nfunction of the family as an educational, economic, moral, and\r\nspiritual institution as also its relation to state, industry, and\r\nsociety in general in the matter of social control.\r\n\r\nIn this first volume of the series the effort is to show that the\r\nAmerican family is a product of European folkways, of the economic\r\ntransition to modern capitalism, and of the distinctive environment of\r\na virgin continent. How European customs brought to America underwent\r\nmodification in the new environment and how differences of population\r\nin this country may be traced to geographical differences, constitute\r\nan important part of this treatise. The reader is finally directed to\r\nsee the colonial family as a property institution dominated by middle\r\nclass standards and operating as an agency of social control in the\r\nmidst of the social order governed by the interests of a forceful\r\naristocracy, which shaped religion, education, politics, and all else\r\nto its own profit.\r\n\r\nOn the whole this is a valuable work. When one has finished reading\r\nthis volume, however, he must get the impression that the life of the\r\nslave attached to the colonial family has not been adequately treated.\r\nAmong the early colonists the African slave was connected with the\r\nfamily after the manner of the bondmen of families in ancient\r\ncountries. The slaves, being few in number, maintained this relation\r\nuntil the industrial revolution throughout the modern world changed\r\nthe institution from a patriarchal to an economic one. Prior to this\r\ntime the slaves were treated almost as well as the children of the\r\nfamily. They lived under the same roof, worshipped at the same altar\r\nand in some cases were taught in the same school. Care was taken so to\r\nelevate the slave and keep him above corrupting influences as to make\r\nhim not merely a tool for exploitation but a decided asset in the\r\nfamily economy of life. That the slave of this type had much to do\r\nwith the development of the colonial family no one will doubt.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on servitude and sexuality in the South, the Negro\r\nslave gets negative mention. The author says that the presence of\r\nAfrican slaves and Indians early gave rise to the problem of\r\nmiscegenation. He concedes that it took some time to develop in the\r\nwhites the attitude of race integrity and that the intercourse between\r\nmen and women of the inferior race was never eliminated. During this\r\nperiod white women of the indentured servant class often yielded to\r\nmiscegenation with the African male slaves and, as the author states,\r\nplanters sometimes married white women servants to Negroes in order to\r\ntransform the women and their offspring into slaves. The author might\r\nhave added that this was especially true of Maryland.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Readjuster Movement in Virginia._ By CHARLES CHILTON PEARSON,\r\nPh.D., Professor of Political Science in Wake Forest College. Yale\r\nUniversity Press, New Haven, 1917. Pp. 191.\r\n\r\nThe author undertakes here to describe one of the developments in\r\nVirginia politics during the period between the Civil War and the\r\nfirst administration of Grover Cleveland. He considers the last fifty\r\nyears of the history of Virginia the _Dark Age_ during which there has\r\nbeen a period of radicalism followed by reaction. The Readjuster\r\nMovement was one of the independent waves of thought which\r\ncharacterized the reactionary period. It centered around William\r\nMahone as the leader of an efficient machine endeavoring to readjust\r\nthe State debt by compelling its creditors to share in the loss caused\r\nby the expensive internal improvement policy, the misfortunes of the\r\nCivil War and the extravagance of the Reconstruction period. It was in\r\nline with the general effort to readjust the economic and social\r\npolicies of the entire country. It appealed to the people for the\r\nreason that unlike radicalism it was not obstructive of \"democratic\r\nadvance\" in that it did not alienate the western section of the state\r\nthrough its attitude towards the Negro. Native in its origin, the\r\ndemocracy of the party was primarily intended for the whites, though\r\nthe Negroes were accepted as desirable supporters. Such an independent\r\nmovement was impossible until the continued defeat of the Republican\r\nparty sufficiently removed the fears of the whites as to conduce to\r\ndevelopment of independent thinking. Citizens were thereafter more\r\neasily won to the cause of thus elevating the ruined and indebted\r\nclasses by transferring to the government their will that the burdens\r\nof the State should be shifted to other shoulders. The author believes\r\nthat this party found ready support also for the reason that it was\r\nnot only a party but a social code and a state of mind which bound the\r\nwhites to united and temperate action. He does not take the position\r\nthat the work of the party was accomplished without conflict between\r\nthe aristocratic and democratic forces. It required a long time to\r\nremove the differences between the aristocrats composed of the leaders\r\nof the old regime and the \"soldier cult\" on one hand and, on the\r\nother, the democratic element composed of the westerners and upstarts\r\nwhom the Civil War and Reconstruction brought to power in the east,\r\nthe poor whites and the freedmen.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note how he accounts for the fate of the Negro\r\nvoter. He says that the Negro rising with the tide of democracy was\r\nabout to be incorporated into the body politic, but that the habit of\r\nimplicit obedience to overseers and a boss proved too strong. \"These\r\nresults,\" says he, \"seemed to necessitate and to anticipate the\r\nelimination of the Negro as a voter.\" The decline of the political\r\npower of the Negro in Virginia is unfortunately considered by many as\r\ndue to this cause. The author is wrong to leave the reader to infer\r\nthat the Negro's incapacity to participate intelligently in the\r\naffairs of the government actually led to his elimination. The demands\r\nof race prejudice impelled all southern States to reduce the Negro to\r\na lower status just as soon as the North loosed its hold on the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe local club of the Association for the Study of Negro Life and\r\nHistory is now making a serious study of Negro American History under\r\nthe direction of Dr. Carter G. Woodson. The work was begun in November\r\nand will be completed in February. The phases of history to be\r\nconsidered are: _The Negro in Africa_, _The Enslavement of the Negro_,\r\n_Patriarchal Slavery in America_, _Slavery and the Rights of Man_,\r\n_The Reaction against the Negro_, _Slavery as an Economic\r\nInstitution_, _The Free Negro in the United States_, _The Abolition\r\nMovement_, _The Colonization Project_, _Slavery and the Constitution_,\r\n_The Negro in the Civil War_, _The Reconstruction of the Southern\r\nStates_, _The Negro in Freedom_, _The Negro and Social Justice_.\r\n\r\nDodd, Mead and Company will soon publish for Professor Benjamin G.\r\nBrawley a work entitled _The Genius of the Negro_. The aim of the book\r\nwill be to set forth what the Negro has done in literature, art and\r\nthe like.\r\n\r\nLongmans, Green and Company have published _The Education of the\r\nAfrican Native_. This will throw light on the much mooted question as\r\nto what the Europeans have done to promote the mental development of\r\nthe native of the dark continent.\r\n\r\nIn the seventh volume of the _Documentos para la Historia Argentina_\r\nare found materials bearing on the _Comercio de Indias, Consualdo,\r\nComercio de Negros y Extranjeros_, 1791-1809.\r\n\r\nThe June number of the _Political Science Quarterly_ contained an\r\narticle _The Negro Vote in Old New York_ by D. E. Fox.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JOURNAL\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nNEGRO HISTORY\r\n\r\nVOL. III--APRIL, 1918--NO. 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN BANNEKER, THE NEGRO MATHEMATICIAN AND ASTRONOMER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe city of Washington very recently celebrated the 125th anniversary\r\nof the completion of the survey and laying out of the Federal\r\nTerritory constituting the District of Columbia. This was executed\r\nunder the supervision of the famous French civil engineer, Major\r\nPierre Charles L'Enfant, as the head of a commission appointed by\r\nGeorge Washington, then president of the United States. Serving as one\r\nof the commissioners, sitting in conference with them and performing\r\nan important part in the mathematical calculations involved in the\r\nsurvey, was the Negro mathematician and astronomer, Benjamin Banneker.\r\nAs there did not appear to be during this celebration any disposition\r\nto give proper recognition to the scientific work done by Banneker,\r\nthe writer has thought it opportune to present in this form a brief\r\nreview of Banneker's life so as to revive an interest in him and point\r\nout some of this useful man's important achievements.\r\n\r\nOn a previous occasion the writer undertook to collect some data with\r\nthe same object in view, and at that time he addressed a letter to the\r\npostmaster at Ellicott City, Maryland, asking to be put in touch with\r\nsome one of the Ellicott family, who might furnish reliable data on\r\nthe subject. In this way, correspondence was established with the\r\nfamily of Mrs. Martha Ellicott Tyson, of Baltimore. One of her\r\ndescendants, Mrs. Tyson Manly, kindly came over from Baltimore, and,\r\ncalling on the writer at the United States Patent Office, presented\r\nhim with a copy of the life of Banneker, published in Philadelphia in\r\n1884, and compiled from the papers of Martha Ellicott Tyson, who was\r\nthe daughter of George Ellicott, a member of the noted Maryland\r\nfamily, who established the business that developed the town of\r\nEllicott City.\r\n\r\nBetween George Ellicott and Benjamin Banneker, Mrs. Tyson says, there\r\nexisted \"a special sympathy,\"[144] and she further refers to her\r\nfather as \"the warmest friend of that extraordinary man.\"[145] Her\r\nfather had many of Banneker's manuscripts, from which he intended to\r\ncompile a biography of his friend, but his unusually busy commercial\r\nlife afforded him no leisure in which to carry out this much cherished\r\nplan. Mrs. Tyson's account, therefore, can be relied upon as coming\r\ndirectly from those who, personally knowing Banneker, and living in\r\nthe same community in frequent contact with him, had preserved\r\naccurate data from which to publish the true record of his life.\r\n\r\nOn a farm located near the Patapsco Eiver, within about ten miles of\r\nthe city of Baltimore, in the State of Maryland, on the 9th day of\r\nNovember, 1731, Benjamin Banneker was born. Various accounts are given\r\nof his ancestry. One of his biographers states that \"there was not a\r\ndrop of white blood in his veins,\" another asserts with positiveness\r\nthat his parents and grandparents were all native Africans.[146] In\r\nstill another sketch of Banneker's life, read before the Maryland\r\nHistorical Society, on May 1, 1845, it is stated that \"Banneker's\r\nmother was the child of _natives_ of Africa so that to no admixture of\r\nthe blood of the white man was he indebted for his peculiar and\r\nextraordinary abilities.\"[147] Thomas Jefferson said that Banneker was\r\nthe \"son of a black man born in Africa and a black woman born in the\r\nUnited States.\"[148]\r\n\r\nAccording to Mrs. Tyson's account Banneker's mother and father were\r\nNegroes, but his maternal grandmother was a white woman of English\r\nbirth, who had been legally married to a native African. The\r\nantecedent circumstances of this marriage were so unusual as to\r\njustify special mention. Mollie Welsh was an English woman of the\r\nservant class, employed on a cattle farm in England where a part of\r\nher daily duty was the milking of the cows. She was one day charged\r\nwith having stolen a pail of milk that had, in fact, been kicked over\r\nby a cow. The charge seems to have been taken as proved, and in lieu\r\nof a severer punishment she was sentenced to be shipped to America.\r\nBeing unable to pay for her passage she was sold, on her arrival in\r\nAmerica, to a tobacco planter on the Patapsco Eiver to serve a term of\r\nseven years to pay the cost of her passage from England. At the end of\r\nher period of service, this Mollie Welsh, who is described as \"a\r\nperson of exceedingly fair complexion and moderate mental powers,\" was\r\nable to buy a portion of the farm on which she had worked.[149] In\r\n1692, she purchased two African slaves from a ship in the Chesapeake\r\nBay near Annapolis. One of these slaves named Bannaky, subsequently\r\nAnglicized as Banneker, was the son of an African king, and was stolen\r\nby slave dealers on the coast of Africa.[150] With these two slaves as\r\nher assistants, Mollie Welsh industriously cultivated her farm for a\r\nnumber of years with such gratifying success that she felt impelled\r\nafterwards to release her two slaves from bondage. The slave Banneker\r\nhad gained such favor in the eyes of his owner that she married him\r\ndirectly after releasing him from bondage, notwithstanding the fact\r\nthat his record for sustained industry had not equalled that of his\r\nfellow slave, while serving their owner on her farm--a fact that was\r\nperhaps due to Banneker's natural inclination to indulge his royal\r\nprerogatives. This Banneker is described as \"a man of much\r\nintelligence and fine temper, with a very agreeable presence,\r\ndignified manner and contemplative habits.\"[151]\r\n\r\nThere were born of this marriage four children of whom the eldest\r\ndaughter, Mary, married a native African who had been purchased from a\r\nslave ship by another planter in her neighborhood. This slave was of a\r\ndevout nature, and early became a member of the Church of England,\r\nreceiving at his baptism the name of Robert. After baptism, Robert's\r\nmaster set him free. It was, therefore, as a free man that he became\r\nthe husband of Mary Banneker, whose surname he adopted for his own.\r\nFour children were born to Robert and Mary Banneker, one boy and three\r\ngirls, the eldest being Benjamin, the subject of this sketch.\r\n\r\nRobert Banneker had evidently formed some of the habits of thrift\r\nevinced by his mother-in-law, Mollie Welsh, for it is on record that\r\nin 1737 within a few years after receiving his freedom he purchased a\r\nfarm of 120 acres from Richard Gist, paying for it 17,000[152] pounds\r\nof tobacco, which in those days served as a legal medium of exchange.\r\nThis farm, located on the Patapsco Eiver, within about ten miles of\r\nthe town of Baltimore, thus became the Banneker homestead. Here it was\r\nthat young Benjamin spent his early years and grew to manhood,\r\nassisting his father with the general work of the farm.\r\n\r\nBanneker very early showed signs of precocity, which made him the\r\nspecial favorite of his maternal grandmother who took delight in\r\nteaching him to the extent of her own limited mental endowment. She\r\ntaught him to study the Bible, and had him read it to her at regular\r\nintervals for the purpose of training him along religious lines of\r\nthought. He attended a small school in his neighborhood where a few\r\nwhite and colored children were taught by the same white schoolmaster.\r\nUntil the cotton gin and other mechanical appliances made Negroes too\r\nvaluable as tools of exploitation to be allowed anything so dangerous\r\nas education, there were to be found here and there in the South\r\npioneer educators at the feet of whom even Negroes might sit and\r\nlearn.[153]\r\n\r\nAs a boy at school young Banneker is said to have spent very little,\r\nif any, of his time in the games and frolics that constitute so large\r\na part of the school life of the average youth. He was unusually fond\r\nof study, devoting by far the larger part of his time to reading, so\r\nthat it was said of him that \"all his delight was to dive into his\r\nbooks.\" His reading, however, did not take a wide range. His limited\r\nresources did not permit him to purchase the many works he desired.\r\nWhat Banneker lost through the lack of a variety of books, however, he\r\ntried to make up for in being a close observer of everything around\r\nhim. He turned everything that he could into a channel of information\r\nand drew upon all possible sources to keep himself posted on the\r\ngeneral activities of his community and beyond. In this way, \"he\r\nbecame gradually possessed of a fund of general knowledge which it was\r\ndifficult to find even among those who were far more favored by\r\nopportunity than he was.\"[154]\r\n\r\nAlthough Banneker had by this time begun to ingratiate himself into\r\nthe favor of the very best element in his community solely through his\r\ndemonstration of mental superiority, he did not permit his unusual\r\npopularity and his love of study to render him any less helpful to his\r\nfather in the cultivation of the farm. He proved himself to be just as\r\nindustrious in farming as he was diligent in studying. When his father\r\ndied in 1759, leaving to Benjamin and his mother, as joint heirs, the\r\ndwelling in which they lived, together with 72 acres of land,[155]\r\nBenjamin was fully prepared to assume control of affairs on the\r\nestate, and make it yield a comfortable living for him and his mother.\r\nHis father had divided the remaining 28 acres of the original farm\r\namong the three daughters who also survived him. His farm was said to\r\nbe one of the best kept farms in his neighborhood. It was well\r\nstocked, containing a select assortment of fruit trees, a fine lot of\r\ncattle, and a specially successful apiary.\r\n\r\nYoung Banneker's diligent reading of the books at his command served\r\nto develop his mental powers rapidly, giving him a retentive memory,\r\ncorrect forms of speech and a keen power of analysis. This faculty\r\ngrew largely out of his special fondness for the study of mathematics,\r\nby which he acquired unusual facility in solving difficult problems.\r\nHe early won the reputation of being the smartest mathematician not\r\nonly in his immediate neighborhood but for miles around. He was often\r\nseen in the midst of a group of neighbors whom he constantly astounded\r\nby the rapidity and accuracy with which he would solve the\r\nmathematical puzzles put to him. This caused such widespread comment\r\nthat he frequently received from scholars in different parts of the\r\ncountry, desiring to test his capacity, mathematical questions, to\r\nall of which, it is said, he responded promptly and correctly.[156]\r\n\r\nHis close attention to the study of mathematics led him easily into\r\nthe quest of some practical form by which to give tangible expression\r\nto his thought. It is highly probable that this fact can explain the\r\nfacility with which he planned and completed at the age of thirty a\r\nclock which stands as one of the wonders of his day.[157] \"It is\r\nprobable,\" says one, \"that this was the first clock of which every\r\nportion was made in America; it is certain that it was as purely his\r\nown invention as if none had ever been before. He had seen a watch,\r\nbut never a clock, such an article not being within fifty miles of\r\nhim.\"[158] He completed this clock with no other tools than a pocket\r\nknife, and using only wood as his material. It stood as a perfect\r\npiece of machinery, and struck the hours with faultless precision for\r\na period of 20 years.\r\n\r\nThe successful completion of this clock attracted to Banneker the\r\nattention of his entire community, serving as the starting point of a\r\nmore brilliant career. It was this display of mechanical genius which\r\nengaged the attention of the Ellicotts, who had lately moved into his\r\nneighborhood from Pennsylvania. They had already heard of the unusual\r\naccomplishments of this gifted Negro and lost no time in getting in\r\ntouch with him, especially since one of the Ellicotts was himself a\r\nmathematician and astronomer of marked ability.[159]\r\n\r\nThe meeting with the Ellicotts was of signal advantage to Banneker,\r\nand ultimately proved the turning point in his career. They were of\r\nQuaker origin and had gone down to Maryland in 1772 in search of a\r\ndesirable location for the establishment of flour mills. They were\r\nevidently persons of foresight. Being progressive, open-minded and\r\ncomparatively free from the prejudices that were then mostly native to\r\nthe section into which they had moved, they cordially received\r\nBanneker and frankly proclaimed his talents.[160] They did not seem to\r\npermit the differences of race to erect a single barrier between\r\nBanneker and themselves in the ordinary run of their frequent business\r\nintercourse. When the Ellicotts were erecting their mills, the\r\nfoundation of Ellicott City, they purchased from Banneker's farm a\r\nlarge portion of the provisions needed for the workmen. His mother,\r\nMary Banneker, attended to the marketing, bringing poultry,\r\nvegetables, fruit and honey to the Ellicott workmen.[161]\r\n\r\nBanneker's mechanical inclination led him to take unusual interest in\r\nthe building of the Ellicott Mills, and to make frequent visits there\r\nto watch the operation of the machinery. In the course of time a store\r\nwas built near the mills, and it became the meeting place of nearly\r\nall the wide-awake and worth while people in the community, who would\r\nlinger together to talk of the news of the day. This was the ordinary\r\nmeans of news exchanging in those days when there were no dailies nor\r\nbulletins nor hourly extras. Banneker was always a welcome participant\r\nin these gatherings although he was a man of modest demeanor, never\r\ninjecting himself into the conversation in an unseemly manner. When,\r\nhowever, he permitted himself to be drawn into discussions, he always\r\nexpressed his views with such clearness and intelligence that he won\r\nthe respect of his hearers.[162]\r\n\r\nThe friendship between George Ellicott and Banneker grew stronger as\r\nthe years went by, and their common interests in mathematics and\r\nnatural science led to a fellowship which often brought them together.\r\nThis interest led George Ellicott to lend Banneker a number of\r\nmathematical books and instruments. Among these books were Mayer's\r\n_Tables_, Ferguson's _Astronomy_ and Leadbetter's _Lunar Tables_. When\r\nthese books and instruments were handed to Banneker it was Ellicott's\r\nintention to remain there a while to give Banneker some personal\r\ninstruction in the use of them, but he was prevented by lack of time\r\nfrom carrying out this intention. On calling again on Banneker shortly\r\nafterward, to offer him this instruction, Ellicott was surprised to\r\nfind that Banneker had already discovered for himself the key to the\r\nuse of both and was \"already absorbed in the contemplation of the new\r\nworld which was thus opened to his view.\"[163] They had literally made\r\nhim fix his gaze on the stars, for the study of astronomy thus became\r\nhis one absorbing passion.\r\n\r\nHe had now nearly covered his three score years, and it was no little\r\ntribute to his mental vigor that he should have determined at that age\r\nto master so abstruse a science as astronomy. But by degrees he gave\r\nhimself up to its study with unusual zeal. His favorite method of\r\nstudying this science was to lie out on the ground at night, gazing up\r\nat the heavens till the early hours of the morning. He then tried to\r\nrestore his tired mind and body by sleeping nearly all the next day.\r\nThis habit nearly caused him to fall into disrepute among his\r\nneighbors, who, ignorant of his plans, accused him of becoming lazy in\r\nhis old days.\r\n\r\nIn 1789 he had advanced so far with his plan as to project a solar\r\neclipse, the calculation of which he submitted to his friend George\r\nEllicott. In the study of these books Banneker detected several errors\r\nof calculation, and, writing to his friend Ellicott, he made mention\r\nof two of them. On one occasion he wrote:\r\n\r\n     \"It appears to me that the wisest men may at times be in error;\r\n     for instance, Dr. Ferguson informs us that, when the sun is\r\n     within 12 deg. of either node at the time of full, the moon will be\r\n     eclipsed; but I find that, according to his method of projecting\r\n     a lunar eclipse, there will be none by the above elements, and\r\n     yet the sun is within 11 deg. 46' 11\" of the moon's ascending node.\r\n     But the moon, being in her apogee, prevents the appearance of\r\n     this eclipse.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again he wrote Ellicott:\r\n\r\n     \"Errors that ought to be corrected in my astronomical tables are\r\n     these: 2d vol. Leadbetter, p. 204, when anomaly is 4s 30 deg. the\r\n     equation 3 deg. 30' 4\" ought to have been 3 deg. 28' 41\". In [Symbol:\r\n     Mars] equation, p. 155, the logarithm of his distance from\r\n     [Symbol: Sun] ought to have been 6 in the second place from the\r\n     index, instead of 7, that is, from the time that its anomaly is\r\n     3s 24 deg. until it is 4s O deg..\"\r\n\r\n     [Transcriber's Note: In above paragraph the actual astronomical\r\n     symbols for Mars and the Sun appear. Also, 4s appears as 4\r\n     superscript s, and 3s appears as 3 superscript s.]\r\n\r\nActing upon the suggestion of one of his educated friends, Banneker\r\nnow undertook to extend his calculations so as to make an Almanac,\r\nthen the most comprehensive medium of scientific information. Banneker\r\ncontinued the work required to complete his almanac, and finished the\r\nfirst one to cover the year 1792, when he was sixty-one years old.\r\nThis attracted to him a number of prominent men, among whom was Mr.\r\nJames McHenry, of Baltimore, a member of John Adams's cabinet. This\r\ngentleman, through his high regard for Banneker's achievements, had\r\nhis almanac published by the firm of Goddard and Angell of Baltimore.\r\nIn his letter to this firm McHenry paid a fine tribute to the\r\ncharacter of the author, although some of his statements as to\r\nBanneker's parentage do not harmonize with what appears to the writer\r\nas more reliable information from another source. McHenry laid special\r\nstress upon the fact that Banneker's work, in the preparation of his\r\nalmanac, \"was begun and finished without the least information or\r\nassistance from any person, or from any other books,\" than those he\r\nhad obtained from Mr. Ellicott, \"so that whatever merit is attached to\r\nhis present performance is exclusively and peculiarly his own.\"[164]\r\n\r\nThat Mr. McHenry attached a wider significance to Banneker's\r\nattainments than is implied in a merely personal achievement is shown\r\nin his statement that he considered \"this negro as a fresh proof that\r\nthe powers of the mind are disconnected with the color of the skin,\r\nor, in other words, a striking contradiction to Mr. Hume's doctrine,\r\nthat the negroes are naturally inferior to the whites, and\r\nunsusceptible of attainments in arts and sciences?\" \"In every\r\ncivilized country,\" said he, \"we shall find thousands of whites,\r\nliberally educated and who have enjoyed greater opportunities for\r\ninstruction than this negro, (who are) his inferiors in those\r\nintellectual acquirements and capacities that form the most\r\ncharacteristic features in the human race.[165] But the system that\r\nwould assign to these degraded blacks _an origin different from the\r\nwhites_, if it is not ready to be deserted by philosophers, must be\r\nrelinquished as similar instances multiply; and that such must\r\nfrequently happen, cannot be doubted, _should no check impede the\r\nprogress of_ _humanity_, which, ameliorating the conditions of\r\nslavery, necessarily leads to its final extinction.\"[166]\r\n\r\nReferring to their attitude, the publishers said in their editorial\r\nnotice that \"they felt gratified in the opportunity of presenting to\r\nthe public, through their press, an accurate Ephemeris for the year\r\n1792, calculated by a sable descendant of Africa.\" They flatter\r\nthemselves \"that a philanthropic public, in this enlightened era, will\r\nbe induced to give their patronage and support to this work, not only\r\non account of its intrinsic merit (it having met the approbation of\r\nseveral of the most distinguished astronomers of America, particularly\r\nthe celebrated Mr. Rittenhouse), but from similar motives to those\r\nwhich induced the editors to give this calculation the preference, the\r\nardent desire of _drawing modest merit from obscurity_ and\r\ncontroverting the long established illiberal prejudice against the\r\nblacks.\"[167]\r\n\r\nBanneker had himself not lost sight of the probable effect of his work\r\nin reshaping to some extent the public estimate concerning the\r\nintellectual capacity of his race. And this was the thought that\r\nprompted him to send a manuscript copy of his first almanac to Thomas\r\nJefferson, then Secretary of State in Washington's cabinet. In his\r\nletter to Jefferson, dated August 19, 1791, Banneker made, with\r\ncharacteristic modesty, a polite apology for the \"liberty\" he took in\r\naddressing one of such \"distinguished and dignified station,\" and then\r\nproceeded to make a strong appeal for the exercise of a more liberal\r\nattitude towards his downtrodden race, using his own achievements as a\r\nproof that the \"train of absurd and false ideas and opinions which so\r\ngenerally prevails with respect to the Negro should now be\r\neradicated.\"[168]\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson took note of the moral courage and the loyalty to\r\nrace evident throughout the whole of Banneker's remarkable letter and\r\nhe honored it with the most courteous reply, under date of August 30,\r\n1791. After thanking Banneker for the letter and the almanac\r\naccompanying it, Jefferson expressed the pleasure it afforded him to\r\nsee such proofs \"that nature has given to our black brethren talents\r\nequal to those of the other colors of men, and that the appearance of\r\na want of them is owing only to the degraded condition of their\r\nexistence both in Africa and America.\" He also added that he desired\r\n\"ardently to see a good system commenced for raising the condition\r\nboth of their body and mind to what it ought to be.\" The copy sent to\r\nJefferson was formally transmitted to M. de Condorcet, secretary of\r\nthe Academy of Sciences at Paris, and member of the Philanthropic\r\nSociety because, as he said, he \"considered it a document to which\r\nyour whole race had a right for its justification against the doubts\r\nwhich have been entertained of them.\" This recognition of Banneker's\r\nmerit very naturally added greatly to his rapidly growing reputation\r\nat home, and brought to him hundreds of letters of congratulation from\r\nscholarly men throughout the civilized world.\r\n\r\nThe most distinguished honor that came to him from his own countrymen\r\nwas the invitation to serve with the commission appointed by President\r\nWashington to define the boundary line and lay out the streets of the\r\nFederal Territory, later called the District of Columbia. This\r\ncommission, was appointed by Washington, in 1789, and was composed of\r\nDavid Stuart, Daniel Carroll, Thomas Johnson, Andrew Ellicott and\r\nMajor Pierre Charles L'Enfant, a famous French engineer. This\r\npersonnel was given in the article on Benjamin Banneker by John R.\r\nSlattery in the _Catholic World_ in 1883,[169] but in the _Washington\r\nEvening Star_ of October 15, 1916, reporting an address by Fred\r\nWoodward, the commission was said to consist of \"Major L'Enfant,\r\nAndrew Ellicott, Count de Graff, Isaac Roberdeau, William King,\r\nNicholas King, and Benjamin Banneker, a free Negro.\"[170] It is on\r\nrecord that it was at the suggestion of his friend, Major Andrew\r\nEllicott, who so thoroughly appreciated the value of his scientific\r\nattainments, that Thomas Jefferson nominated Banneker and Washington\r\nappointed him a member of the commission. In the Georgetown _Weekly\r\nLedger_, of March 12, 1791, reference is made to the arrival at that\r\nport of Ellicott and L'Enfant, who were accompanied by \"Benjamin\r\nBanneker, an Ethiopian whose abilities as surveyor and astronomer\r\nalready prove that Mr. Jefferson's concluding that that race of men\r\nwere void of mental endowment was without foundation.\"[171]\r\n\r\nSpeaking afterwards of his work with this commission, Banneker\r\nreferred to the unfailing kindness and courtesy of the distinguished\r\ncompany in which he found himself. One of his biographers says that\r\nthe deportment of the mathematician during this engagement was such as\r\nto secure for him the respect and admiration of the commissioners. His\r\nstriking superiority over all other men of his race whom they had met\r\nled them to disregard all prejudices of caste.[172] During the stay of\r\nthe commissioners at their official quarters, Banneker was invited, of\r\ncourse, to eat at the same table with them just as he sat with them\r\nduring the conferences. This invitation, however, he declined, and\r\nprovision was then, at his request, made for serving his meals at a\r\nseparate table but in the same dining room and at the same hour as the\r\nothers were served.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for Banneker's refusal to accept this invitation, however,\r\nare not so clear. Various of his biographers have attributed his\r\naction on this occasion to what they seemed pleased to term his\r\n\"native modesty.\" Judging it at this distance from the time of its\r\noccurrence, it is perhaps difficult to understand fully his motive.\r\nBut if we view it in the light of the consistent wisdom and\r\nhigh-mindedness that seemed to guide his whole life we can hope that\r\nhis reasons for the self-imposed coventry on that occasion were\r\nsufficient unto himself, and that they fully excluded every element of\r\nservility.\r\n\r\nBanneker's work with this commission was undertaken while he was still\r\nengaged in astronomical investigation, and after his services in\r\nWashington were concluded he returned to his home and resumed his work\r\non his almanacs, which regularly appeared until 1802. He was now\r\nliving alone in the home left him by his parents, and performed for\r\nhimself nearly all the domestic services required for his health and\r\ncomfort. Still obliged to rely mainly upon his farm for his\r\nlivelihood, he tried various expedients with different tenants to rid\r\nhimself of the necessity for giving so much of his time to the farm.\r\nIn these efforts he was wholly unsuccessful. He finally decided,\r\ntherefore, to enter into such an arrangement in the disposition of his\r\neffects as would provide him an annuity, relieving himself of all\r\nanxiety for his maintenance and at the same time affording him the\r\nleisure he wanted for study. This he was enabled to do through a\r\ncontract with one of the Ellicotts, by the terms of which his friend\r\nwas to take the title to Banneker's property, making the latter an\r\nannual allowance of 12 pounds for a given period of time calculated by\r\nBanneker to be the span of years he could reasonably be expected to\r\nlive. Banneker was to continue to occupy and use the property during\r\nhis life, after which the possession was to go to Ellicott.[173]\r\nBanneker lived, however, eight years longer than he thought he would,\r\nbut Ellicott faithfully lived up to this contract. This miscalculation\r\nis said to have been the only mistake in mathematics Banneker ever\r\nmade. With his domestic affairs settled to his satisfaction, and\r\nhaving now the desired leisure to continue his studies, he gave\r\nhimself up wholly to that object.\r\n\r\nHis active mind now found time also for occasional diversion to other\r\nlines than mathematics. It was about this time that he made the\r\ncalculations showing that the locust plague was recurrent in cycles of\r\n17 years each. He also wrote a dissertation on bees which has been\r\nfavorably compared with a similar contribution by Pliny on the same\r\nsubject written nearly 1800 years earlier. Banneker's nature seemed\r\ntuned also to the softer notes in the song of life. He loved music,\r\nand often, as a relaxation, he would sit beneath a huge chestnut tree\r\nnear his house and beguile the hours by playing on his flute or\r\nviolin.[174]\r\n\r\nThe disastrous war waged in 1793 so disturbed Banneker that he devoted\r\nmuch time to the study of the best methods to promote peace. To this\r\nend he suggested that the United States Government establish a\r\ndepartment in the President's cabinet to be in charge of a Secretary\r\nof Peace. He then made a strong appeal to the authorities of his\r\ngovernment to take a broad stand based on humanity and justice and in\r\nthat spirit to formulate a comprehensive plan by which _A Lasting\r\nPeace_[175] might be substituted for the wars that were then\r\ndisturbing the world.\r\n\r\nDuring these years his home was frequently visited by people who\r\nsought him because of his intellectual gifts, and who were in no wise\r\nabashed by the fact of his racial connection. To them he was merely an\r\nhonored citizen in the field of achievement.[176] \"During the whole of\r\nhis long life,\" says Benjamin Ellicott, \"he lived respectably and much\r\nesteemed by all who became acquainted with him, but more especially by\r\nthose who could fully appreciate his genius and the extent of his\r\nacquirements. Although his mode of life was regular and extremely\r\nretired,--living alone, having never married, cooking his own victuals\r\nand washing his own clothes, and scarcely ever being absent from\r\nhome,--yet there was nothing misanthropic in his character; for a\r\ngentleman who knew him thus speaks of him: 'I recollect him well. He\r\nwas a brave-looking pleasant man, with something very noble in his\r\nappearance.' His mind was evidently much engrossed in his\r\ncalculations; but he was glad to receive the visits which we often\r\npaid him.\"\r\n\r\nAnother writes: \"When I was a boy I became very much interested in\r\nhim, as his manners were those of a perfect gentleman: kind, generous,\r\nhospitable, humane, dignified, and pleasing, abounding in information\r\non all the various subjects and incidents of the day, very modest and\r\nunassuming, and delighting in society at his own house. I have seen\r\nhim frequently. His head was covered with a thick suit of white hair,\r\nwhich gave him a very dignified and venerable appearance. His dress\r\nwas uniformly of superfine broadcloth, made in the old style of a\r\nplain coat, with straight collar and long waistcoat, and a\r\nbroad-brimmed hat. His color was not jet-black, but decidedly negro.\r\nIn size and personal appearance, the statue of Franklin at the Library\r\nof Philadelphia, as seen from the street, is a perfect likeness of\r\nhim. Go to his house when you would, either by day or night, there was\r\nconstantly standing in the middle of the floor a large table covered\r\nwith books and papers. As he was an eminent mathematician, he was\r\nconstantly in correspondence with other mathematicians in this\r\ncountry, with whom there was an interchange of questions of difficult\r\nsolution.\"[177]\r\n\r\nMrs. Tyson describes the courtliness of his manner when receiving\r\nfriendly visits from the ladies of his community, who delighted to\r\ncall on him in his neat cottage, to have the pleasure of his rare\r\nconversation. On these occasions he would sometimes allude to his love\r\nof the study of astronomy as quite unsuited to a man of his\r\nclass.[178]\r\n\r\nIn the earlier years of his life Banneker is said to have formed the\r\n\"social drink\" habit, which we can imagine was all the easier for a\r\nman of his agreeable manners, in an environment where hospitality was\r\ngeneral, and in a day when cordiality usually expressed itself in that\r\nway. But to the credit of his strength of mind and will, it is also\r\nsaid that he actually overcame that habit by the mere determination\r\nthat he would do it, and that on his return from his stay with the\r\ncommission at Washington he is said to have declared rather proudly\r\nthat he never partook once of the wines that were so freely offered\r\nhim.[179]\r\n\r\nBanneker was not a professing Christian and not an adherent of any\r\nchurch, but \"he loved the doctrines and mode of worship of the Society\r\nof Friends, and was frequently at their meetings.\" A contemporary\r\nsays: \"We have seen Banneker in Elkridge meeting house, where he\r\nalways sat on the form nearest the door, his head uncovered. His ample\r\nforehead, white hair and reverent deportment gave him a very venerable\r\nappearance, as he leaned on the long staff (which he always carried\r\nwith him) in quiet contemplation.\"[180]\r\n\r\nThere was no blemish in the entire record of his singularly active and\r\nuseful life. His whole span of years appears to have been spent with a\r\nconscience void of offense, and he approached the end with a\r\nsereneness of mind well befitting the high ideals set before him.\r\nAlthough his body never wandered far from the place of his birth, his\r\nmind was permitted to soar through all space and to dwell in the\r\nregions of the stars and the planets. We can never know how sorely his\r\nfiner spirit grieved over the tribulations that beset his blood\r\nkinsmen in the days of their bondage in this land of their birth, but\r\nwe can well believe that in the loftiness of his soul he dreamed the\r\ndream of their ultimate release.\r\n\r\nAs the shadows gathered about him towards the evening of his life he\r\nabandoned those pursuits that had brought him merited distinction, and\r\nhad gained for him the admiration of a host of friends chiefly among\r\npeople that the world called superior. One beautiful Sabbath\r\nafternoon, in the month of October, 1806,[181] while quietly resting\r\nin the shade of a tree beside his cottage on the brow of a hill that\r\noverlooked the Patapsco Valley he seemed to hear the voices that\r\nbeckoned him to the other world. And as if stirred by some sudden\r\nimpulse he rose and made an effort to walk once more along the paths\r\nthat had so often been his quiet retreat in the moments of his deep\r\nreflections. He had not gone far, when his strength gave way, and he\r\nsank helpless to the ground. He was assisted back to his home by a\r\nfriendly neighbor, but the noon of his day having fully merged into\r\nthe evening, the dark shadows of Eternal Night settled over him.\r\n\r\nDirectly after Banneker's death, in fact, on that very day, his\r\nsisters, Minta Black and Mollie Morton, undertook to carry out his\r\nwishes with respect to the disposition to be made of his personal\r\neffects. Banneker had, a few years before, directed that \"all the\r\narticles which had been presented to him by George Ellicott,\r\nconsisting of his books and mathematical instruments, and the table on\r\nwhich he made his calculations should be returned as soon as he should\r\ndie.\"[182] He also requested that \"as an acknowledgment of a debt of\r\ngratitude for Ellicott's long-continued kindness he should be given a\r\nvolume of the manuscripts containing all his almanacs, his\r\nobservations on various subjects, his letter to Thomas Jefferson, and\r\nthe reply of that statesman.\" All the rest that he possessed was left\r\nto the two sisters. It was due to the faithful execution of his wishes\r\non the very day of his death that his valuable manuscripts were\r\npreserved at all. They were all carried to George Ellicott, and this\r\ncircumstance was the first notice that Ellicott received of the\r\npassing away of his friend. \"Banneker's funeral took place two days\r\nafterward, and while the ceremonies were in progress at his grave, his\r\nhome took fire and burned so rapidly that nothing could be\r\nsaved.\"[183]\r\n\r\nSome time before his death Banneker gave to one of his sisters the\r\nfeather bed on which he usually slept, and this she preserved as her\r\nonly keepsake of him. Years after wards she had occasion to open the\r\nbed and, feeling something hard among the feathers, she discovered\r\nthat it was a purse of money. This circumstance shows that Banneker\r\nwas not \"in the evening of his life overshadowed by extreme\r\npoverty.\"[184]\r\n\r\nIn an excellent paper read on April 18, 1916, before the Columbia\r\nHistorical Society of Washington, by Mr. P. Lee Phillips, of the\r\nLibrary of Congress, _Banneker's Almanac_ was compared with Benjamin\r\nFranklin's _Poor Richard's_ Almanac. Mr. Phillips also referred to his\r\nefforts in behalf of peace and to the friendship that existed between\r\nBanneker and such distinguished men of his time as Washington and\r\nJefferson. He closed his article on Banneker with the broad-minded\r\ndeclaration that \"Maryland should in some manner honor the memory of\r\nthis distinguished citizen, who, notwithstanding the race prejudice of\r\nthe time, rose to eminence in scientific attainments, the study of\r\nwhich at that early date was almost unknown.\"[185] The recognition of\r\nDouglass in Rochester and Boston, Pushkin in Petrograd and Moscow and\r\nDumas in Paris, affords splendid suggestions of what we hope to see of\r\nBanneker in Baltimore. It is a sad reflection on the people of this\r\ncountry that practically nothing has been done to honor this\r\ndistinguished man.\r\n\r\n                                   HENRY E.

In the days of darkest forebodings and of the\r\ngreatest human sufferings these two pioneers of religion went forth to\r\ndisseminate ideas and mold sentiments which were to shape the inner\r\nsprings of conduct of their fellow-slaves. Sketches of these heroes\r\nmust claim the attention of seekers for the truth as to this important\r\nphase of our history.\r\n\r\nA letter dated September 15, 1790, from the late Reverend Mr. Joseph\r\nCook of Euhaw, upper Indian Land, South Carolina, says: \"A poor Negro,\r\ncommonly called, among his friends, Brother George,[186] has been so\r\nhighly favored of God, as to plant the first Baptist Church in\r\nSavannah, and another in Jamaica.\" This man was George Liele. He was\r\nborn in Virginia about 1751. He knew very little of his mother, Nancy,\r\nbut was informed by white and black that his father was a very devout\r\nman. The family moved much during the youth of George, but finally\r\nsettled in Georgia.\r\n\r\nAs a youth George Liele had a natural fear of God, holding constantly\r\nin mind His condemnation of sin. Liele was converted through the\r\npreaching of the Reverend Matthew Moore,[188] who later baptized him.\r\nDesiring then to prove the sense of his obligations to God, Liele\r\nbegan to instruct his own people. Crude but firm in purpose, he soon\r\nshowed ministerial gifts and after a trial sermon before a quarterly\r\nmeeting of white ministers was licensed as a local preacher. He\r\npracticed preaching on different plantations, and in the church to\r\nwhich he belonged, on evenings when there was no regular service.\r\nAfter a short period he began his regular ministerial work, serving\r\nabout three years at Brunton Land, and at Yamacraw, where developed a\r\nnumber of useful communicants.[189]\r\n\r\nAmong these early members of the Yamacraw church were Reverend David\r\nGeorge, who later labored, with permission from the Governor, in the\r\nministry at Nova Scotia, with sixty communicants, white and black;\r\nReverend Amos, who preached with good results at New Providence, one\r\nof the Bahama Islands, to about three hundred members; and Reverend\r\nJesse Gaulsing, who preached near Augusta, in South Carolina to sixty\r\nmembers. Preaching later from Chapter III Saint John, and the clause\r\nof verse 7, \"Ye must be born again,\" George Liele moved to repentance\r\na more useful man, Andrew Bryan, and a noted woman named Hagar.[190]\r\nAfter Liele organized this influential church at Yamacraw, then a\r\nsuburb of Savannah, Mr. Henry Sharp, his master, encouraged this\r\npioneer by giving him his freedom.\r\n\r\nMr. Sharp was an officer in the war and died from wounds received in\r\nthe King's service.[191] Soon after the death of Mr. Sharp there arose\r\nthose who were dissatisfied with George's liberation. He was taken and\r\nthrown into prison, but by producing his manumission papers was\r\nreleased. To extricate himself from this unpleasant situation Liele\r\nbecame obligated to a Colonel Kirkland. At the evacuation of Savannah\r\nby the British he was partly obliged to come to Jamaica, as an\r\nindentured servant for money he owed Colonel Kirkland, who promised to\r\nbe his friend in that country. Upon landing at Kingston he was upon\r\nthe recommendation of the Colonel to General Campbell, the Governor\r\nof Jamaica, employed by him two years, and, on leaving the island, the\r\ngovernor gave Liele a certificate of his good behavior. As soon as\r\nLiele had paid his debt to Colonel Kirkland, he obtained for himself\r\nand family a certificate of freedom from the vestry and governor,\r\naccording to the law of this Island.[192] Thus by force of\r\ncircumstances George Liele was compelled to leave those among whom he\r\nhad labored so effectively and thrown into another field where he had\r\nopportunity for further service.\r\n\r\nLiele's work in Jamaica began in September, 1784. He started in\r\nKingston by preaching in a private house to a small congregation.\r\nNext, he organized a church with four other men who had come from\r\nAmerica. His message had a telling effect especially on the slaves.\r\nThe effectiveness of his work is also seen from the fact that\r\npersecutions at baptisms and meetings which were, at first, frequent,\r\nlater became a less serious hindrance. Upon frequent petitions,\r\nhowever, the Jamaica Assembly finally granted free worship of God to\r\nall those desiring it. So successfully did Liele work that in a short\r\nwhile he had in the country together with well wishers and followers\r\nabout fifteen hundred communicants, to whom he preached twice on each\r\nSunday, in the morning and afternoon, and twice in the week.[193]\r\n\r\nThe work of the church was extended by a few deacons and elders, and\r\nby teachers of small congregations in the town and country. Thomas\r\nNichols Swigle became Liele's chief assistant. His particular work was\r\nto regulate church matters, serve as deacon, and also to teach a free\r\nschool opened for the instruction of free and slave children. The work\r\ncontinued to spread through Swigle, who became a minister after the\r\norder of Liele. He said: \"About two months ago, I paid my first visit\r\nto a part of our church held at Clinton Mount, Coffee Plantation, in\r\nthe Parish of Saint Andrew, about sixteen miles distance from\r\nKingston, in the High mountains, where we have a chapel and 254\r\nbrethren.\" About his work in general he said: \"I preach, baptize,\r\nmarry, attend funerals, and go through every work of the ministry\r\nwithout fee or reward.\"[194]\r\n\r\nIt was soon evident that there must be some definite place of worship.\r\nTo this end a piece of land about three acres at the east end of\r\nKingston was purchased for the sum of about 155 pounds and on it a\r\nchurch building fifty-seven by thirty-seven feet was begun. Because\r\nthe congregation was poor and gifts were small, Liele had a struggle\r\nto complete his building. He interested in his cause several gentlemen\r\nof influence, among whom was a Mr. Stephen Cooke, a member of the\r\nAssembly, who in turn asked help of friends in England. By January 12,\r\n1793, he was able to say that not only was the Kingston church\r\ncompleted but that in Spanish Town also he had purchased land for a\r\ncemetery with a house on it which served as a church building. The\r\nKingston church, the first of its kind in Jamaica, under the\r\nleadership of Liele had twelve trustees, all of whom were members of\r\nthe congregation, whose names were specified in the title recorded in\r\nthe office of the secretary of the island.[195]\r\n\r\nWhile establishing the churches at Savannah and at Jamaica, Liele\r\nreceived nothing for his services. He was on a mission and without\r\ncharge preached, baptized, administered the Lord's Supper, and\r\ntravelled from one place to another to settle church affairs. He did\r\nthis so as not to be misunderstood and not to hinder the progress of\r\nthe church of Christ. Mr. Stephen Cooke, in giving his opinion of\r\nLiele, said that he was \"a very industrious man, decent and humble in\r\nhis manners, and, I think, a good man.\" His family life was pleasant.\r\nHe had a wife and four children, three boys and a girl. Liele followed\r\nfarming for a regular occupation, but because of the uncertain seasons\r\nin Jamaica, kept horses and wagons for employment in local\r\ntransportation for the government by contract. He was business-like\r\nand kept the good will of the public. Although busy, Liele found time\r\nto read some of the good books which he had in his meager collection\r\nand also to write letters explaining the growth of his work in Jamaica\r\nand inquiring after the progress of the church at Savannah, then\r\npastored by Andrew Bryan.[196]\r\n\r\nIn building up the membership of his churches Liele showed great tact.\r\nUnlike the Methodists who were rapidly coming forward at this time, he\r\nwould not receive any slaves who had not permission of their owners.\r\nThis not only increased the membership of the church but it made\r\nfriends for their cause among the masters and overseers. So careful\r\nwas Liele to get the confidence of the masters and overseers that he\r\nordered a bell for his church just a mile and a half out of Spanish\r\nTown in Jamaica, not particularly to give warning to the slaves about\r\nthe time of meeting, but to the owners of slaves that they might know\r\nthe time when their slaves should return to the plantations. The\r\nchurch covenant, a collection of certain passages of Scripture, which\r\nwas used once a month, was shown to members of the legislature, the\r\nmagistrates and justices to secure their approval that they might give\r\ntheir slaves permission to become members of the congregation.[197]\r\n\r\nThe effect of the work of Liele is well narrated in a statement of an\r\noverseer who sat at breakfast with Swigle at Clinton Mount, sixteen\r\nmiles from Kingston. He said that he did not need an assistant nor did\r\nhe make use of the whip, for whether he was at home or away,\r\neverything was conducted as it should have been. The slaves were\r\nindustrious, with a plenty of provision in their ground and a plenty\r\nof live stock in their barns; and they, one and all, lived together in\r\nunity, brotherly love and peace. With a mission to serve, this man\r\nthen made his way into the hearts of his fellows.\r\n\r\nAndrew Bryan, the other pioneer, was born in 1737 at Goose Creek,\r\nSouth Carolina, about sixteen miles from Charleston. His mother was a\r\nslave and died in the service of her master. His father, also a\r\nslave, became infirm with years, dying at the age of one hundred and\r\nfive. Andrew became converted under the preaching of George Liele when\r\nthe latter served the church in Savannah. Bryan married a woman named\r\nHannah about nine years after his conversion. His wife remained a\r\nslave in the service of Jonathan Bryan for a long time after her\r\nmarriage, but was finally purchased by her husband.[198]\r\n\r\nAndrew Bryan began to preach to congregations of black and a few white\r\npeople at Savannah just eight or nine months after Liele's departure\r\nfor Jamaica. Edward Davis encouraged Bryan and his followers to erect\r\na building on his land in Yamacraw for a place of worship, of which\r\nthey were later artfully dispossessed. In the beginning of their\r\nworship, frequent interruptions came from the whites. It was at a time\r\nwhen many Negro slaves had absconded, and some had been taken away by\r\nthe British. This was an excuse for the wickedness of the whites, who\r\nthen became more cruel in whipping and imprisoning the worshipers,\r\nundertaking to justify their action before the magistrates. When\r\nGeorge Liele was preaching in and near Savannah, he did not suffer\r\nfrom such molestation, because the British then ruled the country, but\r\nAndrew Bryan began his work under different conditions about the time\r\nwhen Georgia became independent.\r\n\r\nFor refusing to discontinue his work Andrew Bryan was twice\r\nimprisoned. Sampson, his brother, who was converted about one year\r\nafter Andrew was, remained with him, however, in all of his hard\r\ntrials. On one occasion about fifty slaves were severely whipped.\r\nAmong these was Andrew, who was cut and bled abundantly. While he was\r\nyet under their lashes, Hambleton says he rejoiced, not only to be\r\nscourged but would freely suffer death for the cause of Jesus Christ.\r\nJonathan Bryan, their kind master, was much affected and grieved over\r\ntheir punishment and interceded for them. George Walton said \"that\r\nsuch treatment would be condemned even among barbarians.\"\r\n\r\nThey were brought before chief justices Henry Osborne, James Habersham\r\nand David Montague, who released them. Chief Justice Osborne then gave\r\nthem liberty to continue their worship \"between sunrising and sun\r\nset.\"[200] Their master told the magistrate that he would give them\r\nthe liberty of his own house or barn, at a place called Brampton,\r\nabout three miles from town, and that they should not be interrupted\r\nin their worship. They accepted the offer of Jonathan Bryan and\r\nworshipped with little or no interruption at Brampton for about two\r\nyears. Many slaves thereafter attended the services held in the barn\r\nat Brampton.\r\n\r\nWhite preachers often visited his congregation. Lorenzo Dow, perhaps\r\nthe foremost white itinerant preacher of his time, on one occasion\r\npreached to Bryan's congregation, while he was imprisoned, feeling\r\nthat in their hour of trial these Negroes especially needed his\r\nencouragement. The whites to whom Dow preached offered him money, but\r\nhe did not take it as he did not wish the wrong construction put upon\r\nhis efforts nor to be deemed an impostor. As he was once leaving\r\nSavannah, however, after he had been entertained largely by Negroes,\r\nAndrew Bryan met him and, on shaking hands, gave him eleven and a half\r\ndollars which the Negroes presented him as a donation. By these visits\r\nof Dow and other preachers, Bryan and his followers were greatly\r\nhelped.[201] Among others who visited Bryan's church were Abraham\r\nMarshall and Thomas Burton who examined and baptized about sixty in\r\nthis connection.\r\n\r\nReverend Mr. Marshall gave this congregation over his signature two\r\nimportant certificates which follow:\r\n\r\n     This is to certify that upon examination into the experiences and\r\n     characters of a number of Ethiopians, and adjacent to Savannah,\r\n     it appears that God has brought them out of darkness into the\r\n     light of the Gospel, and given them fellowship one with the\r\n     other; believing it is the will of Christ, we have constituted\r\n     them a church of Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\nOn January 19, 1788, he sent Bryan the following:\r\n\r\n     This is to certify, that the Ethiopian church of Jesus Christ at\r\n     Savannah, have-called their beloved Andrew to the work of the\r\n     ministry. We have examined into his qualifications, and believing\r\n     it to be the will of the great head of the church, we have\r\n     appointed him to preach the Gospel, and to administer the\r\n     ordinances, as God in his providence may call.[202]\r\n\r\nOut of the midst then of great persecutions Andrew Bryan became the\r\nofficial head of an established church.\r\n\r\nThe death of Jonathan Bryan, the master of Andrew Bryan, marked an\r\nepoch in the useful career of this pioneer preacher. By consent of the\r\nparties concerned, he purchased his freedom for the sum of fifty\r\npounds. He then bought a lot in Yamacraw and built on it a residence\r\nnear the rough building Sampson Bryan had built some time before. When\r\nthe Bryan estate was finally divided, the lot on which Sampson had\r\nbeen permitted to build became the property of an attorney, who\r\nmarried a daughter of the deceased Mr. Bryan and received 12 pounds a\r\nyear for it. In these readjustments there were no serious\r\ninterruptions to the worship of Andrew Bryan's congregation. The seven\r\nhundred members worshiped not only without molestation, but in the\r\npresence, and with the approbation and encouragement of many of the\r\nwhite people.[203]\r\n\r\nWith this large membership Bryan needed but did not have a regular\r\nassistant. In his absence his brother Sampson preached for him.\r\nBryan's plan was to divide his church when the membership became too\r\nlarge for him to serve it efficiently. This finally had to be done.\r\nThis branch of the church was organized as the Second African Baptist\r\nChurch of Savannah with Henry Francis, a slave of Colonel Leroy\r\nHammond, as pastor. Francis showed such remarkable ability that some\r\nwhite men, who considered him unusual, purchased his freedom that he\r\nmight devote all of his time to his chosen work. Not many years\r\nthereafter Bryan's church again reached the stage of having an\r\nunwieldy number and it was further divided by organizing in another\r\npart of the city the Third African Baptist Church.\r\n\r\nBryan exercised the greatest of care in his public and private\r\nobligations and manifested much interest in his family. In 1800 he\r\nwrote Dr. Rippon: \"With much pleasure, I inform you, dear Sir, that I\r\nenjoy good health, and am strong in body, at the age of sixty-three\r\nyears, and am blessed with a pious wife, whose freedom I have\r\nobtained, and an only daughter and child who is married to a free man,\r\ntho' she, and consequently under our laws, her seven children, five\r\nsons and two daughters, are slaves. By a kind Providence I am well\r\nprovided for, as to worldly comforts, (tho' I have had very little\r\ngiven me as a minister) having a house and lot in this city, besides\r\nthe land on which several buildings stand, for which I receive a small\r\nrent, and a fifty-six acre tract of land, with all necessary\r\nbuildings, four miles in the country, and eight slaves; for whose\r\neducation and happiness, I am enabled thro' mercy to provide.\"[204]\r\n\r\nHis church became in the course of time the beacon light in the Negro\r\nreligious life of Georgia. From this center went other workers into\r\nthe inviting fields of that State, until the Negro preacher became\r\ncircumscribed during the thirties and forties by laws intended to\r\nprevent such disturbances as were caused by Nat Turner in starting an\r\ninsurrection in Virginia. Andrew Bryan, however, did not live to see\r\nthis. He passed away in 1812, respected by all who knew him and loved\r\nby his numerous followers.[205] He was succeeded by his nephew, Andrew\r\nMarshall, who served that church so long that former slaves still\r\nliving have a recollection of his work among these people. In keeping\r\nwith its loyalty to its ministers, this congregation boasts even today\r\nthat in its long history it has had only a few ministers to serve it.\r\n\r\n                                   JOHN W.

That such a procedure, so vigorously\r\ncondemned on many sides when initiated but so gloriously justified in\r\nits results, could have been possible may well prove a cause of wonder\r\nto the student of education a century hence. And indeed, under\r\nordinary circumstances, the establishment of classical colleges and\r\nschools of law, medicine and theology for a primitive people, unable\r\nto read or write, would seem the height of folly. But the\r\ncircumstances were not ordinary. The situation was critical and\r\nunusual remedies were required.\r\n\r\nThe close of the War of the Rebellion in 1865 witnessed something new\r\nin the field of educational problems. A group numbering nearly four\r\nmillions was presented to the American nation for training in the\r\nessentials of manhood and the duties of citizenship. The\r\napprenticeship which this group had served had been spent under a\r\nsystem that did little more than acquaint them with the cruder tools\r\nof industry and an imperfect use of a modern language. And while it\r\nis true that many individual slaves acquired considerable skill in\r\nindustrial pursuits and a few became artisans of a rather high order,\r\nthe great mass of Negroes were laborers of the lowest class, requiring\r\nthe exercise of an intelligence but little above that of the beasts of\r\nburden. On the side of the mastery of letters the best that can be\r\nsaid by even the most generous students of this subject is that, at\r\nthe beginning of the year 1861, about ten per cent. of the adult\r\nNegroes in the United States could read and write.[208]\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of the white South the liberation of the slaves\r\nhad let loose upon the land what they considered a horde of\r\nhalf-savage blacks, descendants of jungle tribes, inferior in every\r\nrespect to the white man and incapable of assimilating the knowledge\r\nof the dominant race or of becoming citizens except in name only. In\r\naddition to this attitude there remained in the South the traditional\r\nidea that education was the peculiar privilege of the favored few of\r\nthe white race, and, except in its lowest reaches, a non-essential in\r\nthe life of the masses. At the close of the Civil War free public\r\nschools were unknown in that section.[209] When it came to the\r\nquestion of educating the Negro, all of the teachings and practice of\r\nthe South stamped it as a dangerous risk. To offer him the higher\r\ncourses of college and university grade was indeed an absurdity.\r\n\r\nThe North, on the other hand, looked upon the slave as a sufferer\r\nreleased from an earthly torment and, because of his long period of\r\ninvoluntary servitude, deserving of recompense of every kind that the\r\nnation could bestow. As to his mental capacity, the North believed\r\nthat in order to rise from his degraded state and to take his place\r\namong the races of civilized men the freedman awaited only the same\r\nmeans of education that the Anglo-Saxon for centuries had enjoyed.\r\nWhatever may be the judgment of history concerning these two\r\nconflicting views, it is clear that the South had neither the\r\ninclination nor the means to enter upon the task of educating the\r\nNegro whereas the North was abundantly supplied with both.\r\n\r\nHere, at any rate, was a situation offering the greatest opportunity\r\nfor the exercise of philanthropic zeal, both in the way of financial\r\naid and personal service. And to this call the North responded,\r\npouring out treasure, labor and love in a way that stamps the whole\r\nmovement of educating the Negro in America during the first half\r\ncentury of his freedom as one of the most heroic examples of true\r\nmissionary zeal of all times. Those who took an active part in the\r\nmovement, including founders and teachers, seemed imbued with no other\r\nidea than that of giving the best and in the largest measure. They\r\nwent to their tasks and took with them their ideals of human equality\r\nand brotherhood. Every effort was bent toward raising the unfortunate\r\nrace to the level of their own standards of intellect, of society and\r\nof morals. They, therefore, applied to the solution of the problem the\r\nonly educational machinery that they knew. Experiments in education\r\nwould not supply the immediate need. No man was to be limited in his\r\nopportunities for intellectual development. Only his own desire and\r\ncapacities were to determine his limitations. Besides, such\r\nopportunity was necessary for the training of leaders and must not be\r\ndenied. Howard University was a child of this movement and the\r\ngreatest embodiment of this idea.\r\n\r\nThe situation out of which this institution evolved requires some\r\ncomment. The abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia and\r\nlater throughout the South resulted in a large influx of freedmen into\r\nthe National Capital until they formed one third of its population,\r\nthus constituting the largest urban group of Negroes in the world. The\r\neducational problem presented by this group was quickly realized by\r\nvarious freedmen's aid organizations and philanthropic individuals\r\nwith the result that day and night schools were immediately\r\nestablished for persons of all ages, providing instruction in the\r\nelementary studies.[210] In the opinion of many the situation had\r\nbeen fully met by the establishment of these elementary schools. The\r\ntask had been difficult and attended with much opposition and even\r\nopen violence. The problem of the future was the maintenance and\r\nextension of such schools at their present grade. Others, on the other\r\nhand, considering the task only half done, believed that their duty\r\nwould be fully discharged only when an institution of higher learning\r\nhad been established at the capital of the nation, where Negro youth\r\ncould be trained for positions of leadership.\r\n\r\n\"Such an Institution,\" said one of the founders of Howard University,\r\n\"was demanded by the necessities of the great educational movement\r\nwhich was inaugurated among the freed people at the close of the late\r\nwar. When primary, secondary and grammar schools were being opened\r\nthroughout the South, for the benefit of a class hitherto wholly\r\ndeprived of educational advantages, it became evident that\r\ninstitutions of a higher grade were needed for the training of the\r\nteachers and ministers who were to labor in this field. It was with a\r\nview of supplying this need that Howard University was founded.\"[211]\r\nOn November 17, 1866, at the Columbia Law Building opposite Judiciary\r\nSquare in Washington, was uttered the first word from which the idea\r\nof Howard University evolved. Using this building as a temporary house\r\nof worship, members of the First Congregational Church[212] were on\r\nthat date holding a meeting on missions with Dr. C. B. Boynton, the\r\npastor of the church. After remarks by several persons concerning\r\nvarious phases of the duty of the country towards the freedmen,\r\nReverend Benjamin F. Morris, a son of former Senator Thomas A. Morris,\r\nof Ohio, arose to speak. He referred to his surprise and gratification\r\nat the remarkable showing made in theological studies, by half a dozen\r\nyoung colored men in an examination which he had recently witnessed.\r\nThese were students in what was then known as Wayland Institute, which\r\nhad at that time only one teacher. In this enthusiasm he expressed the\r\nwish that the Congregational Church might some day establish a\r\ntheological school at the capital of the nation.[213]\r\n\r\nThe seed thus sown found such fruitful soil in the minds of the pastor\r\nand Reverend Danforth B. Nichols that they, with Mr. Morris, resolved\r\nto see the plan carried out at a subsequent meeting to be held at the\r\nresidence of Mr. Henry H. Brewster for the purpose of establishing a\r\nNew Missionary Society. At this meeting there prevailed the idea that\r\nsuch a society was not needed for the reason that the American\r\nMissionary Association was already occupying this field. Mr. Morris\r\nthereupon took the floor and advocated the establishment of a\r\ntheological school for the preparation of colored men for the ministry\r\nto work in the South and to go as missionaries to Africa. Dr. Boynton\r\nsupported the plan and urged immediate action; Dr. Nichols, in\r\nanswering objections raised concerning the financing of the project,\r\nsuggested the possibility of aid from the Freedmen's Bureau, an idea\r\nwhich marked the beginning of the relationship of the University with\r\nthe Federal Government.\r\n\r\nAt the next meeting, a committee appointed to bring in a plan of\r\norganization, recommended that a night school be opened at first; that\r\napplication be made to the Commissioner of the Freedmen's Bureau for\r\nquarters, fuel and light for the school; and that three chairs of\r\ninstruction be established. These recommendations were adopted and the\r\nfirst faculty appointed comprised the following: Evidences and\r\nBiblical Interpretation, Reverend E. W. Robinson; Biblical History\r\nand Geography, Reverend D. B. Nichols; Anatomy and Physiology, Dr.\r\nSilas Loomis. Thus was the University born with neither a local\r\nhabitation nor a name. It was styled a Theological Institute and its\r\naim was \"the education of the colored youth for the ministry.\"[214]\r\n\r\nThe development of plans for this new educational center was rapid.\r\nSenator Pomeroy, of Kansas, who had become greatly interested in the\r\nmovement, suggested at first an extension of the original idea so as\r\nto include the training of teachers. Later he made a motion that the\r\ndoors be thrown open to all who wished to enter. This proposition was\r\nheartily agreed to, and Howard was given the distinction of being the\r\nfirst University in America to be established without some restriction\r\nbased on race, sex, creed or color.[215] At a later meeting held to\r\nconsider the charter, it was decided to embrace in that instrument\r\nuniversity privileges and to provide for the departments of theology,\r\nlaw and medicine.\r\n\r\nWhen the question of a name was reached several were suggested and\r\nrejected. Finally Dr. Nichols proposed that the University bear the\r\nname of \"The American Philanthropist, the Commissioner of the\r\nFreedmen's Bureau, the true friend of the downtrodden and oppressed of\r\nevery color and nation of the Earth,\" General Oliver Otis Howard.[216]\r\nThis was enthusiastically adopted with but one dissenting vote, that\r\nof General Howard himself, who felt that his usefulness to the new\r\ninstitution would be greater under another name than his.\r\n\r\nThe act of incorporation was drawn by Senator Pomeroy, of Kansas, and\r\npresented to the Senate by Henry Wilson, of Massachusetts, afterwards\r\nVice-President of the United States under Grant. Senator Pomeroy was\r\none of the incorporators and a member of the first board of trustees.\r\nSenator Wilson had attended several of the organization meetings and\r\nwas an enthusiastic supporter of the plan. The bill passed both houses\r\nof Congress and became a law when President Andrew Johnson affixed his\r\nsignature, March 2, 1867. The first meeting of the corporation was\r\nheld at the residence of Mr. Brewster for the purpose of organizing\r\nthe board of trustees. This board was made to include the seventeen\r\nincorporators with the addition of General G. W. Balloch who was\r\nelected treasurer.\r\n\r\nThe preliminaries disposed of, the University began its work by\r\nopening classes in the Normal and Preparatory Departments united on\r\nthe first of the following May. The first student body consisting of\r\nfive pupils were altogether young white women, the daughters of\r\ntrustees Robinson and Nichols.[217] The recitations were held in a\r\nrented frame building, previously used as a German dance hall and\r\nsaloon, which stood on the east side of what is now Georgia Avenue, a\r\nshort distance south of W Street.[218] The building and lot were later\r\npurchased by the University but finally sold when the classes were\r\nremoved to their permanent home.\r\n\r\nThe selection of the permanent site for the University is due largely\r\nto the fortunate combination of judgment, persistence and faith\r\ncharacteristic of General Howard. He, with General E. Whittlesey,\r\nacting as a committee on the selection of a site, wished to procure\r\nthe commanding elevation in the northern part of the city where the\r\nUniversity now stands. This was part of the tract of 150 acres known\r\nas _Effingham_ and owned by John A. Smith. On the plea that the\r\nlocation of a Negro school would depreciate the remainder of his\r\nproperty, the owner refused to sell any part of it. After much\r\nargument, General Howard asked him to state his price for the whole\r\nfarm. The rate given was one thousand dollars an acre, making a total\r\nvaluation of $150,000, a staggering sum under the circumstances.\r\nUndaunted, however, General Howard closed the bargain, although the\r\ntreasury of the University was without a single dollar. Adjustments\r\nbrought the final purchase price for the property down to $147,500,\r\nfor which the corporation made itself responsible.[219]\r\n\r\nWith the exception of about thirty acres, the land was divided into\r\nlots and sold at a price averaging about four times its original\r\ncost.[220] The part reserved consisted of the main campus now\r\noccupied by the academic building, dormitories and residences; the\r\nsite of the Medical School and the old Freedmen's Hospital; and a park\r\nbetween the two covering four city blocks.[221]\r\n\r\nThe main part of the purchase price for the property was supplied by\r\nthe Freedmen's Bureau. The funds from the sale of the property not\r\nneeded for University purposes were placed in the treasury to be used\r\nfor the construction of buildings.[222] The corporation received\r\nadditional grants from the Freedmen's Bureau, bringing the sum\r\nobtained from this source to about $500,000.[223] With these funds\r\nseveral residences for professors and four large buildings were\r\nerected; namely University Hall, Miner Hall, Clark Hall and the\r\nMedical Building. Clark Hall, the boys' dormitory, was named in honor\r\nof David Clark, of Hartford, Connecticut, who contributed $25,000\r\ntoward the support of the University. Miner Hall, the dormitory for\r\ngirls, was named in honor of Miss Myrtilla Miner, one of the pioneers\r\nin the education of colored girls in the District of Columbia.[224]\r\n\r\nThe early financial management of the University soon brought it into\r\ndifficulties. The hopeful spirit of the times and the enthusiasm and\r\nfaith of those in charge of the enterprise were responsible for the\r\ntoo rapid expansion of the first few years of the existence of the\r\ninstitution which resulted in a constantly growing deficit. A\r\nfinancial statement for the first eight years up to June 30, 1875,\r\nleaving out of account the value of lands and buildings given by the\r\nGovernment and of borrowed funds, shows receipts of $645,067.30 and\r\nexpenditures of $744,914.56, leaving a deficit of nearly $100,000. At\r\nthe annual meeting of the trustees, May 31, 1873, it was decided that\r\na retrenchment of one half the current expenses would be necessary in\r\norder to avert disaster. To effect this the management had to make\r\nradical readjustment in the faculties and in the salary schedule. To\r\nthis end every salaried officer in the University resigned upon the\r\nrequest of the trustees.\r\n\r\nIn reestablishing the faculties the basis was one of rigid economy and\r\nthe only way by which the situation could be saved; for the\r\nnation-wide financial crisis of 1873 and the lean years that followed\r\nprecluded the possibility of any increase in the income. The success\r\nof this measure[225] is indicated by the fact that the immediate\r\nexpenses of the University were reduced from $57,160.40 in 1872 to\r\n$9,446.19 in 1877. \"This heroic treatment,\" says former President\r\nPatton, \"far too long delayed, saved the institution, but it cost it\r\nmuch in professors, in students and in prestige.\" The vessel escaped\r\nshipwreck with loss of many of the crew and passengers and a lot of\r\nher cargo. The professional departments were cut off from any support\r\nfrom the general funds, and remanded to receipts from tuition fees and\r\nspecial donations. College professorships were reduced from $2,500 to\r\n$1,200 and a residence worth $300; and the salaries of other officers\r\nwere similarly reduced. Incidentals were brought down to the lowest\r\nliving figure, and finally, with half the main building and a large\r\npart of the dormitories closed, the point was reached at which the\r\nincome covered expenses.[226]\r\n\r\n                                   DWIGHT O.

Its southern boundary was an irregular line passing south\r\nof the Medical School building and including a small part of the\r\nground now occupied by the American League baseball park. Its northern\r\nboundary toward the east extended up to and at one point a little\r\nbeyond what is now Hobart Street, tapering toward the west and meeting\r\nGeorgia Avenue at Fairmount Street.

The\r\nground is now leased by the government from Howard University for a\r\nrental of one dollar a year.\r\n\r\n[222] William M. Patton, _The History of Howard University_, p. 17.\r\n\r\n[223] The Freedmen's Bureau was established in 1866 by the Federal\r\ngovernment for the purpose of promoting the general welfare of the\r\nfreedmen. General Howard was made commissioner of the organization and\r\nheld this office until 1872, when it was discontinued. It was through\r\nthis relation with the Freedmen's Bureau that the University became\r\nthe creature and ward of the Federal Government, a relation that has\r\nbeen maintained continuously ever since.\r\n\r\nThe commissioner of the bureau was granted large powers, including the\r\ncontrol of all subjects relating to refugees and freedmen from slave\r\nStates or from any district or county within the territory embraced in\r\nthe operations of the army, under such rules and regulations as might\r\nbe prescribed by the head of the bureau and the President.\r\n\r\nGeneral Howard during the existence of the bureau disbursed\r\napproximately $13,000,000 in various ways. Much of this was used for\r\neducational purposes, including all grades of work. Among some of the\r\nbeneficiaries of this fund were Lincoln University, Wilberforce\r\nUniversity, Berea College, Fisk University, Biddle University,\r\nStraight University and Lincoln Institute. In his efforts to enable\r\nthe people of the District of Columbia to share the benefits of this\r\nfund the commissioner offered to erect a building for a certain\r\ndenominational institution located in Washington at that time, on the\r\ncondition that it become undenominational. The offer was declined,\r\nwhereupon the trustees of Howard University immediately made\r\napplication to receive this Federal aid. Because of the location of\r\nthe proposed institution at the nation's capital the application was\r\nfavorably acted upon and liberal appropriations made so that the\r\ninstitution might stand as a monument to the nation's philanthropy.\r\n\r\nAs these large expenditures for Howard University with the other\r\noperations of the bureau brought upon General Howard charges of\r\nmalfeasance, which led to two investigations, it should be said here\r\nthat both of the official investigations, one civil, the other\r\nmilitary, completely exonerated him.--See _Report of Special Committee\r\nof the Trustees of Howard University upon Certain Charges_, etc.,\r\n1873, and _Act of March 3, 1865, establishing the Bureau of Refugees,\r\nFreedmen and Abandoned Lands_.\r\n\r\n[224] It is worthy of note that the magnificent new home of the\r\nMyrtilla Miner Normal School of Washington is named in honor of the\r\nsame noble woman. It stands on a site formerly owned by the University\r\nand looks upon Miner Hall several hundred yards away across the\r\ncampus.\r\n\r\n[225] Much credit for the skillful financial management of the\r\ninstitution during these critical times is due to the secretary and\r\ntreasurer, Mr. James B. Johnson, who was a potent factor in the early\r\nstruggles of the institution. He was secretary and treasurer for many\r\nyears, dying while still in service in 1898.\r\n\r\n[226] William M.

Mr. Rhodes referred\r\nto him as an expert, with the request that he make a careful\r\nexamination of the article and write a reply to the same, or perhaps\r\nto make such comments as would furnish Mr. Rhodes with the information\r\ndesired. I have been favored, through a mutual friend, with a copy of\r\nthat reply, which is now before me and to which I shall now proceed to\r\nmake a reply.\r\n\r\nIn a labored effort to weaken the force of what I have written, this\r\nexpert in his opening generalization made several observations which\r\nmay be classed under three different heads: first, if the white men\r\nreferred to by me were of such a high character, why should the acts\r\naccredited to them have been of such a low character? second, that I\r\nam influenced in what I write about that period by racial bias and the\r\nfact that I was an active participant in the events referred to;\r\nthird, that what I write is based upon my own experience and memory,\r\nmuch of which is liable to be inaccurate through the treachery of\r\nmemory, the same not being fortified by references to other historical\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nThis expert says:\r\n\r\n     An obvious general comment on the article is that if the\r\n     Reconstruction period throughout the South and in Mississippi in\r\n     particular was engineered and controlled by men of such high\r\n     character as Mr. Lynch records, why should the acts accredited\r\n     to them have been of such a low character? It is not enough to\r\n     say that there were \"mistakes\"; the measures were too numerous\r\n     and systematic for this. It is to be noticed that Mr. Lynch does\r\n     not attempt to controvert statements of events in Mississippi,\r\n     with one or two exceptions to be considered below. To attempt to\r\n     review the conclusions to which Mr. Lynch takes exception would\r\n     involve a review of too great a mass of evidence. The web of\r\n     Reconstruction is such a tangled one, that even if one has\r\n     carefully considered a large part of the great bulk of primary\r\n     material on the subject, generalizations on the period must still\r\n     be accepted cautiously. This much may be said: Mr. Rhodes's\r\n     conclusions are in harmony with those of the other trained\r\n     historical students who have devoted time to a careful study of\r\n     this period. Mr. Lynch's racial bias, the fact that he was an\r\n     active participant in the events, and finally that his judgments\r\n     are based on his own experiences and not on a closer study of a\r\n     far wider field of material, make whatever he writes of value as\r\n     source material, but at the same time mitigate against its value\r\n     as an impartial opinion. This is especially evident from the fact\r\n     that he makes no attempt either in the article or in his book to\r\n     substantiate his statements by such references to his authorities\r\n     as modern historiography demands. His authority is of course,\r\n     himself and his recollections, and the recognition of the\r\n     treachery of the memory is a first fundamental in historical\r\n     work.\r\n\r\nReferring to my contention that thousands of white men were identified\r\nwith the Republican party during the Reconstruction period he further\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n     A comparison of census and election statistics do not give\r\n     support to this fact; and tho such figures are far from exact,\r\n     they give a basis for generalizing superior to that of any\r\n     personal recollection, or, indeed, of anything short of a general\r\n     agreement of contemporary statements to the contrary. No such\r\n     agreement exists so far as I have been able to search. In\r\n     Tennessee, North Carolina, Arkansas, and to less extent in\r\n     Virginia and Texas, there were a considerable number of white\r\n     Republicans; but in the other southern states in no election\r\n     between 1868 and 1872 did the Republican vote equal the census\r\n     figures for Negroes of voting age in 1870. The nearest approach\r\n     to this was in South Carolina in 1870, when the Republican vote\r\n     for governor was 85,000 and the Negroes of voting age 85,400. In\r\n     Mississippi the nearest approach was in the vote for Grant in\r\n     1872, when there were 82,000 votes against the census figures of\r\n     90,000. The machinery for getting out the Negro vote, and it was\r\n     Republican machinery, was such as to permit the assumption that\r\n     an unusually large percentage of the Negroes voted at the\r\n     elections.\r\n\r\nUndertaking to prove that Dent was not a carpet-bagger, he says:\r\n\r\n     Tho supported by the Democrats he was nominated by a faction of\r\n     Republicans; moreover, he was a Missourian by birth, had family\r\n     connections in Mississippi, and had, while living in California\r\n     married the daughter of a prominent Mississippian. He was\r\n     scarcely a typical carpet-bagger. That there should have been a\r\n     split in the Republican party of the state so early is not a very\r\n     good argument for the character of the leaders or of the measures\r\n     they endorsed.\r\n\r\n     Of the high hopes of such men as Alcorn there can be no doubt;\r\n     but scarcely less doubtful was the failure to realize their\r\n     hopes. Alcorn himself favored Negro disfranchisement in 1890.\r\n\r\nReferring to others, the expert continues:\r\n\r\n     Judges Peyton was a Republican, Tarbell a carpet-bagger, but\r\n     Simrall is generally classed as a Democrat. He was chairman of\r\n     the state legislative committee that reported in favor of\r\n     rejecting the 14th Amendment. Riley classes him as a Democrat, as\r\n     does Garner, tho Mayes calls him a moderate Republican, of the\r\n     same class as Dent. Tarbell seems to have been a good judge.\r\n     Garner is lukewarm in his appreciation, but Lamar said that \"his\r\n     decisions attest his extraordinary ability and industry.\" All\r\n     commend his uprightness. Tarbell in 1887 called himself a\r\n     conservative carpetbagger, one who found himself in the minority.\r\n     He said that the Republican party in Mississippi collapsed\r\n     through its own weakness; having devised a constitution in which\r\n     \"there was much to praise and to be proud of, and little to\r\n     condemn,\" the party gave birth to legislation of which \"the\r\n     criticism is, in a measure, reversed.\"[227] The judiciary was the\r\n     best department of government under Reconstruction in\r\n     Mississippi.\r\n\r\nTaking up the question of ignorant Negro office holders, he says:\r\n\r\n     All that I find as to Evans, except Garner's statement of \"it was\r\n     alleged,\" is in an account of Reconstruction in De Soto County,\r\n     written by I. C. Nichols in the publication of the Miss. Hist.\r\n     Soc., XI, 307. He does not say that Evans could not read or\r\n     write, but that his \"bondsmen really administered his affairs and\r\n     ran his office.\" At one time there was a charge of defalcation\r\n     against him, but nothing specific, and Nichols concludes that\r\n     nothing really was wrong. After this some changes were made in\r\n     his bondsmen and \"R. R. West was put in charge of the office and\r\n     became Sheriff in all but name.\" West was, perhaps, one of the\r\n     \"honest, efficient, and capable assistants.\" Evans had been a\r\n     slave. In Washington County there was also a negro sheriff,\r\n     Winslow by name. Mr. Lynch does not mention him, but according to\r\n     the testimony of H. B. Putnam, a carpet-bagger, Winslow was\r\n     \"nominally\" sheriff, but his bondsmen ran the office; the\r\n     sheriff, tho he could read and write, was \"incompetent to take\r\n     charge of his office,\" which was worth $10,000 or $15,000 a year\r\n     legitimately, and, according to a white Democrat, about $100,000\r\n     by other means.[228] Scott of Issaquena, whom Mr. Lynch mentions,\r\n     testified before the Boutwell committee, and so far as can be\r\n     judged by that testimony he was a man of fair intelligence, tho\r\n     according to the testimony of one of his own race, not endowed\r\n     with rash courage.[229] The testimony of another carpet-bagger,\r\n     with reference to Holmes County, is interesting, tho it does not\r\n     show whether the sheriff-elect was white or black. He was\r\n     probably not Sumner, as this man never served in the office. This\r\n     carpet-bagger said that the sheriff of the county having died and\r\n     this man elected to fill the vacancy the successor arranged to\r\n     have the witness assist in making the bond. \"Other gentlemen\r\n     hesitated to go on the bond unless I would go there and be\r\n     responsible for the running of the office.\" The man was prevented\r\n     from taking office so nothing came of the arrangement. On the\r\n     whole such first-hand material as I have been able to find does\r\n     not uphold Garner entirely in his estimate of this class of\r\n     officials, especially as to his footnote statement about their\r\n     dishonesty; neither does it give the impression that they were\r\n     worthy, as a whole, of the important positions they occupied. If\r\n     Evans, as described by Rhodes, following Garner, was not typical,\r\n     neither was Bruce.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Lynch gives figures for 1875 and 1907 on financial matters\r\n     and on the basis of these claims that the profligacy of\r\n     Reconstruction finances is not proven. The manifest unfairness of\r\n     taking figures for 1907 may be passed over; but the necessary\r\n     basis of comparison must be wider than this. Nor do his\r\n     conclusions agree with any others that I have seen, nor, which is\r\n     more important, with other statistics. Both those of the census\r\n     or those given annually by Appletons' Annual Cyclopaedia lead to\r\n     other conclusions. Just as an illustration of what is said on the\r\n     other side take this statement, which seems to be that of the\r\n     land tax. This was 1 mill in 1869, 5 mills in 1870, 4 mills in\r\n     1871, 8-1/2 mills in 1872, 12-1/2 mills in 1873, 14 mills in\r\n     1874, 9-1/4 mills in 1875, 6-1/2 mills in 1876, 6-1/5 mills in\r\n     1877, 3-1/2 mills in 1878. Another point that should be\r\n     considered is that Mr. Lynch confines his figures to state\r\n     finances; while it is for local finances that the Reconstruction\r\n     government of Mississippi is most severely condemned.\r\n\r\nConceding a point in this case, he says:\r\n\r\n     Mr. Lynch is correct in saying that the Mississippi senators at\r\n     the time of the state election of 1875 were Alcorn and Bruce.\r\n     Pease had been succeeded by Bruce on March 4 of that year. Pease\r\n     opposed Ames but he was no longer senator.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Lynch, in upholding the Reconstruction policy of Stevens and\r\n     Sumner and what he calls their desire to delay restoration, seems\r\n     to have overlooked the fact that the wisest of all the Civil War\r\n     statesmen desired to get the states back into the Union before\r\n     Congress should meet in December, 1865. Mr. Lynch is right in\r\n     thinking that the 14th Amendment was essentially a correct\r\n     measure, but so also does Mr. Rhodes. The 15th Amendment is quite\r\n     a different proposition, however. Nor does it follow, because\r\n     legislation of some sort might have been necessary to enforce the\r\n     14th Amendment or to take its place when the South refused to\r\n     adopt it, that the Reconstruction Acts were the legitimate\r\n     offspring of that necessity. That the negro soldiers helped to\r\n     win the war is not proof that the war would have failed without\r\n     them, or that the necessary price of their valor was suffrage for\r\n     all the men of their race, the bulk of whom were not capable of\r\n     understanding it; or that such suffrage was necessary to the\r\n     preservation of the Union. Oratory, inside or outside of\r\n     Congress, is not historical proof.\r\n\r\nDirecting attention to my idea of the undoing of Reconstruction he\r\nmaintains:\r\n\r\n     Mr. Lynch's statement that the failure of Reconstruction was due\r\n     to unwise judicial interpretation need not be considered. It is\r\n     anachronistic and does not agree with the views now generally\r\n     accepted by historical students. But what he says of the\r\n     infidelity of Waite and Bradley can be refuted directly from the\r\n     Supreme Court Reports. As to the appointment of these justices,\r\n     there is no evidence that it was because of any specially strong\r\n     nationalistic position on their part. Bradley, if chosen for any\r\n     particular views, got the justiceship because of his attitude on\r\n     legal tender; and the conditions under which Waite was appointed\r\n     do not show up any such bias on his part. In U. S. _v._ Reese the\r\n     court stood seven to two; and the dissentients were Clifford, a\r\n     Democrat, and Hunt, appointed by Grant.\r\n\r\n     In U. S. _v._ Harris (the Ku Klux decision) Woods delivered the\r\n     decision. Harlan alone dissented and only on the question of\r\n     jurisdiction. The bench at that time held two judges appointed by\r\n     Lincoln, two by Grant, two by Hayes, one by Garfield, and two by\r\n     Arthur. The Civil Rights Cases decision was delivered by Bradley.\r\n     Harlan was the only dissenter. These were the three important\r\n     Reconstruction decisions during the term of Waite and Bradley.\r\n     All of them were delivered after Reconstruction had failed. On\r\n     the other hand, Bradley delivered the opinion in Ex parte\r\n     Siebold, in which the federal election laws were upheld, and\r\n     Field and Clifford were the only ones who disagreed with it.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, I frankly confess that what I have written and\r\nshall write in defense of the reconstructed governments at the South\r\nhas been and will be of very little value if it were conceded that the\r\nacts accredited to the men to whom I have referred were of a low\r\ncharacter. This is the very point upon which the public has been\r\nmisinformed, misled and deceived. I do not hesitate to assert that the\r\nSouthern Reconstructed Governments were the best governments those\r\nStates ever had before or have ever had since, statements and\r\nallegations made by Mr. Rhodes and some other historical writers to\r\nthe contrary notwithstanding. It is not claimed that they were\r\nperfect, but they were a decided improvement on those they succeeded\r\nand they were superior in every way to those which are representative\r\nof what Mr. Rhodes is pleased to term the restoration of home rule.\r\nThey were the first and only governments in that section that were\r\nbased upon the consent of the governed. If Mr. Rhodes honestly\r\nbelieved that what he wrote in condemnation and denunciation of those\r\ngovernments was based upon authenticated facts, then the most\r\ncharitable view that can be taken in his case is that he, like\r\nthousands of others, is simply an innocent victim of a gross\r\ndeception.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, whether or not I am influenced by racial ties or\r\npartisan bias in what I have written and may hereafter write, I am\r\nwilling to allow the readers to decide. I am sure that they have not\r\nfailed to see from what I have thus far written, that the controlling\r\npurpose with me is to give actual facts, free from racial partiality\r\nor partisan bias. If some of the things I have written appear\r\notherwise, it is due to the fact that the misrepresentations I am\r\npointing out and correcting have been in the opposite direction. The\r\nidea that I have endeavored to keep in mind is, that what the readers\r\nand students of American history desire to know is the unbiased truth\r\nabout the important events of the period in question and not the\r\njudgment and opinions of the person or persons by whom they are\r\nrecorded.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, the statement that the value of what I have\r\nwritten is impaired because what is said about the important events of\r\nthe period in question is based in the main upon my own knowledge and\r\nexperience, must impress the intelligent reader as being strange and\r\nunusual. He discredits what I say too because I do not make reference\r\nto source materials. What this expert himself has to say is, like most\r\nstudies of Reconstruction, based on ex-parte evidence which is in\r\nviolation of all rules governing modern historical writing. No just\r\njudge would rely altogether on the testimony of one's enemies to\r\ndetermine the truth.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the period under consideration, the difference\r\nbetween what I have written and what has been written by Mr. Rhodes\r\nand some other historical writers is what the lawyers would call the\r\ndifference between primary and secondary evidence. The primary is\r\nalways considered the best evidence, the secondary to be used only\r\nwhen the primary can not be obtained. And yet what I have written is\r\nnot based wholly upon memory. It is only so with reference to\r\ndistinguished persons and important events and tendencies, which are\r\nnot likely to be inaccurate through the treachery of memory. The\r\nstatistical information I have given is not from memory, but from the\r\nfiles of the official records which are accessible to the public. But\r\nit appears that Mr. Rhodes and some other historical writers used only\r\nsuch parts of the official records as answered the purpose they seemed\r\nto have in view, which evidently was to mislead and deceive the\r\npublic. This is virtually admitted by Mr. Rhodes's expert, in stating\r\nthat \"the point Mr. Lynch makes about the defalcation of Hemingway is\r\nan interesting one, and one that is evidently carefully kept in the\r\nbackground by the local writers.\" Yes, they not only kept that point\r\nin the background, but all other points that were not in harmony with\r\nthe purpose they seemed to have in mind, which was evidently one of\r\ndeception and misrepresentation.\r\n\r\nThe reader will not fail to see that Mr. Rhodes's nameless expert\r\npassed over in silence a number of important points in my article.\r\nSome of those alluded to by him he frankly admitted to be right, as in\r\nthe case of Treasurer Hemingway. In the case of Mr. Evans, the Negro\r\nsheriff of De Soto County, he relies upon a statement written by a Mr.\r\nNichols of that county who was evidently a partisan, who makes an\r\neffort to paint Mr. Evans in as unfavorable a light as possible, and\r\nyet he fails to confirm the allegation that Mr. Evans could neither\r\nread nor write, but concludes his communication with the declaration\r\n\"that nothing really was wrong.\" Judging from what is written by Mr.\r\nRhodes's expert I conclude that Garner is the one from whom Mr. Rhodes\r\nobtained most of his misinformation. Yet in speaking of the Negro\r\nsheriffs in a general way Mr. Rhodes's expert was frank enough to say:\r\n\"On the whole such first-hand material as I have been able to find\r\ndoes not uphold Garner entirely in his estimate of this class of\r\nofficials, especially as to his footnote statement about their\r\ndishonesty.\" This bears out the statement made by me that if Mr.\r\nRhodes had desired to be fair and impartial he would have taken all\r\nthe colored sheriffs into consideration and would have drawn an\r\naverage, which would have shown that in point of intelligence,\r\ncapacity and honesty they would have compared favorably with the\r\nwhites.\r\n\r\nThe assertion made by me that the Republican party in the State of\r\nMississippi included in its membership many of the best and most\r\nsubstantial white men in that State is disputed because the Republican\r\nvote in the State at the Presidential election of 1872 happened to be\r\nonly a few thousand less than the number of Negroes in the State of\r\nvoting age, as shown by the census of 1870. It is, therefore, assumed\r\nthat very few if any white men voted the Republican ticket at that\r\nelection. To ascertain the voting strength of a political party census\r\nfigures cannot be relied upon with any degree of certainty, but since\r\nMr. Rhodes's expert seems to think otherwise I am perfectly willing to\r\naccept them in this instance for what they may be worth. The number of\r\nNegroes of voting age in the State at that time, as shown by the\r\ncensus of 1870, was 88,850; whites 76,909, colored majority, 11,941,\r\nand yet the Republican majority in 1872 was 34,887. If the voting\r\nstrength of the two parties were in proportion to the number of blacks\r\nand whites in the State, as this expert would have the public believe,\r\nand the percentage of blacks and whites who voted were about the same,\r\nwhich can be safely assumed, the Republican majority in that case\r\ncould not have been more than 12,000, whereas it was nearly three\r\ntimes that number. Assuming that the Republican and Democratic vote\r\ncombined comprised the whole number that voted at that election, the\r\ntotal number of votes polled was 129,463, which was 36,296 less than\r\nthe number of voters in the State. Of the 36,296 that did not vote I\r\nestimate that at least 16,000 of them were white men. Subtract the\r\n16,000 from the 76,909 white voters and it will be seen that the\r\nnumber of white men that voted at that election was 60,909, and yet\r\nthe Democratic vote was 47,288, which was 13,621 less than the number\r\nof white men that voted. My own estimate is that of the 82,175\r\nRepublican votes, 61,266 were cast by the blacks and 20,909 by the\r\nwhites. Of the 47,288 Democratic votes, 40,000 were cast by the whites\r\nand 7,288 by the blacks.\r\n\r\nFrom the above estimate it will be seen that more than one third of\r\nthe white men that voted at that election voted the Republican ticket.\r\nThis estimate is strengthened when the result of the election in the\r\ndifferent counties is taken into consideration. The Republicans not\r\nonly carried every county in which the Negro voters had a majority,\r\nbut also a number of counties in which the whites were in the\r\nmajority. The majority by which the State was carried by Alcorn in\r\n1869 was about the same as that by which it was carried by Grant in\r\n1872. Alcorn not only carried a number of white counties, but ten of\r\nthem elected Republicans to the Legislature, two of them, Lawrence and\r\nMarion, elected each a Negro member. The ten counties were Pike,\r\nLawrence, Marion, Jackson, Jasper, Clark, Lee, Leak, Lafayette and\r\nAttala. Judge Green C. Chandler, afterwards a judge of the Circuit\r\nCourt and later U. S. District Attorney, was elected from Clark. Hon.\r\nH. W. Warren, who succeeded Judge Franklin as Speaker of the House,\r\nwas elected from Leak, Judge Jason Niles and Hon. E. Boyd, both able\r\nand brilliant lawyers, were elected from Attala. Judge Niles was\r\nafterwards appointed a Judge of the Circuit Court and later served as\r\na Republican member of Congress.\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of this expert Judge Dent, the Democratic candidate for\r\nGovernor in 1869, was scarcely a typical carpet-bagger because he was\r\nborn in Missouri and had family connections in Mississippi. Still if\r\nhe were not a typical carpet-bagger, then we had none in the State,\r\nbecause the designation included all those that settled in the State\r\nafter the war was over. Judge Dent was one of that number. But I may\r\nbe able to give Mr. Rhodes what was believed to be the principal\r\nreason that influenced the Democrats to support Judge Dent. He was\r\nPresident Grant's brother-in-law. Hence it was hoped and believed that\r\nin this case family ties would prove to be stronger than party ties\r\nand that the national administration would support Dent instead of\r\nAlcorn, the Ex-Confederate. But in this case they were mistaken. Grant\r\nhad been elected as a Republican, and he could not be induced to throw\r\nthe weight of his influence against his own party, even in a State\r\nelection, merely to contribute to the realization of the personal\r\nambition of his wife's brother. It is true that a few men who called\r\nthemselves Republicans also supported Judge Dent, but the result of\r\nthe election was conclusive evidence that the so-called split in the\r\nparty was not at all serious.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the three Supreme Court Judges, the expert admits that\r\nPeyton and Tarbell were Republicans, but Simrall, he claims, is\r\ngenerally classed as a Democrat. In support of this assertion\r\nattention is called to the fact, among others, that he was chairman of\r\nthe State legislative committee that reported in favor of rejecting\r\nthe 14th Amendment. But that was before the passage of the\r\nReconstruction Acts and before the Republican party in the State was\r\norganized. Judge Simrall joined the Republican party in 1868 or 1869.\r\nWhat I asserted and now repeat is that he was a Republican when he was\r\nmade a Justice of the State Supreme Court in 1870. Even if he, like\r\nthousands of others, rejoined the Democratic party, that would not\r\ndisprove my assertion that he was a Republican while he was on the\r\nbench. But it appears that he was not one of those that rejoined the\r\nDemocrats, but remained a Republican to the day of his death. In 1884,\r\nnine years after the _Redemption_, he canvassed the State for Blaine\r\nand Logan, Republican candidates for President and Vice-President. In\r\n1890 the Democrats of Warren County in selecting suitable persons to\r\nrepresent them in the State Constitutional Convention to be held in\r\nthe fall of that year were anxious to have the benefit of the\r\nknowledge, ability and experience of Judge Simrall. They took the\r\nliberty of placing his name on their ticket to which it appears he\r\nmade no objection, and in that way he was elected a delegate to that\r\nconvention. But did that make him a Democrat? I am sure both Mr.\r\nRhodes and his expert will allow Judge Sim rail to answer that\r\nquestion for himself and that they will accept his answer as\r\nconclusive on that point. For his answer to that question they are\r\nrespectfully referred to page 704 of the official journal of the\r\nConstitutional Convention of 1890. They will see that the members of\r\nthe convention were politically classified. Each member, of course,\r\nfurnished the information about his own party affiliations. It will be\r\nseen that Judge Sim rail is classified as a \"National Republican.\"\r\nEx-Governor Alcorn was also a member of that convention, having been\r\nelected from Coahoma County in the same way. His political\r\nclassification is that of a \"Conservative.\" So it seems that neither\r\nSim rail nor Alcorn rejoined the Democratic party. Instead, therefore,\r\nof Republicans being obliged to utilize Democratic material in the\r\nselection of Judges, as erroneously stated by Mr. Rhodes, it seems\r\nthat the Democrats were obliged to utilize Republican talent,\r\nexperience and ability to assist them in framing a new constitution. I\r\nam sure the assertion can be safely made that Sim rail and Alcorn were\r\nnot among the \"lovers of good government\" who rejoiced \"at the\r\nredemption of Mississippi\" through the employment of means that Mr.\r\nRhodes so much regretted.\r\n\r\n\"The judiciary,\" the expert asserts, \"was the best department of\r\ngovernment under Reconstruction in Mississippi,\" and yet the Judges\r\nwere all appointed by the Governor, by and with the advice and consent\r\nof the Senate. It goes without saying that if the Governor's\r\nappointees were good, the appointing power was equally as good. The\r\nexpert virtually admits that there was no justification for the\r\ndeclaration that \"all lovers of good government must rejoice at the\r\nredemption of Mississippi,\" when he used the following language: \"Mr.\r\nLynch confines his figures to state finances; while it was for local\r\nfinances that the Reconstruction government of Mississippi is most\r\nseverely condemned.\" In other words, there was nothing wrong with the\r\nState administration; it was the local county and municipal\r\ngovernments that were bad. And yet, a fair and impartial investigation\r\nwill reveal the fact that there is no more foundation for this\r\nallegation than for those about the State government. It is admitted\r\nthat during the early part of Reconstruction the local tax rate was\r\nhigh, the reasons for which are fully explained in _The Facts of\r\nReconstruction_. Such an investigation would show that the charges of\r\nextravagance, recklessness and maladministration so generally made\r\nabout the administration of county and municipal affairs were grossly\r\nexaggerated and nearly, if not all of them wholly untrue. In fact, the\r\nexpert flatly contradicts himself on this point, because he admits\r\nthat the evidence does not support the charge of dishonesty in the\r\ncase of the Negro sheriffs, and yet the sheriff is the principal\r\nofficer in the administration of the county government.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the financial affairs of the State the expert makes\r\nno effort to disprove a single statement I have made. He simply makes\r\nthe broad statement that my conclusions do not agree with other\r\nstatistics, and yet he fails to produce the statistics with which they\r\ndo not agree. To illustrate his point he calls attention to the\r\ndifferent _rates_ of taxation covering a period of about ten years,\r\nwhich if true is of no importance in this connection because the same\r\nhas no bearing upon the material point now under consideration. The\r\ntax _rate_ is always determined by the amount of money needed to meet\r\nthe obligations of the State, predicated upon the assessed value of\r\ntaxable property. Changes in the tax rate, therefore, are liable to be\r\nof frequent occurrence. The material point at issue is the volume of\r\nmoney paid into the treasury and the disposition made of it. In this\r\nconnection a slight amplification of the figures already given will\r\nnot be inappropriate. In 1875, the last year of Republican rule and\r\nthe year the State was _redeemed_, the total receipts from all sources\r\namounted to $1,801,129.12. The disbursements, same year, were\r\n$1,430,192.83, or $370,936.29 less than was received. In 1907 the\r\nreceipts from all sources amounted to $3,391,127.15. The\r\ndisbursements, same year, were $3,730,343.29 or $339,216.14 more than\r\nwas received, and $2,300,150.46 more than was paid out in 1875. In\r\nfact, the financial condition of the State during several years was\r\nsuch that the Legislature was obliged to authorize the issuance of\r\nbonds upon which to borrow money to meet current demands, thus adding\r\nmaterially to the bonded debt of the State. Can any thing more\r\ninexcusable and indefensible than this be imagined? That any one of\r\nthe Reconstructed governments could possibly have been guilty of such\r\nmaladministration as this is inconceivable. And yet, this\r\nadministration typifies what Mr. Rhodes is pleased to term the\r\nrestoration of home rule at the South, for which all lovers of good\r\ngovernment should rejoice.\r\n\r\nThe expert admits that I am right in what was said about Senators\r\nAlcorn and Bruce, but asserts that Senator Pease, Mr. Brace's\r\nimmediate predecessor, was opposed to Ames. This is another assertion\r\nthat is not in harmony with the truth. Ames was a United States\r\nSenator when he was elected Governor. When he resigned the Senatorship\r\nto become Governor there remained about fourteen months of his term.\r\nThere devolved, therefore, upon the Legislature that was elected in\r\n1873, the same time Senator Ames was elected Governor, the duty of\r\nelecting a Senator for the full term and also for the unexpired term.\r\nBruce, an Ames man, was elected for the full term and Pease, also an\r\nAmes man, was elected for the unexpired term. If Pease had been\r\nopposed to Ames he could not have been elected to the Senate by that\r\nLegislature for that was unquestionably an Ames Legislature. It is\r\ntrue Pease was defeated for renomination for State Superintendent of\r\nEducation by the Convention that nominated Ames, still he loyally\r\nsupported the ticket and after the election he was looked upon as one\r\nof the friends and supporters of the Ames Administration. As such and\r\nfor that reason he was elected as one of the administration Senators.\r\nI was a member of Congress at that time and, therefore, had occasion\r\nfrequently to confer with Senator Pease. If he were opposed to Ames, I\r\nam sure that both Mr. Rhodes and his expert will admit that I would\r\nhave known it; and yet I do not hesitate to say that Senator Pease\r\nnever did by word, act or deed cause me to entertain the slightest\r\nsuspicion that he was not a loyal friend and supporter of the Ames\r\nAdministration.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the decisions of the Supreme Court, the expert simply\r\nmakes the declaration that the statement made by me that the failure\r\nof Reconstruction was due to unwise judicial interpretation need not\r\nbe considered. In the first place, it is not true that I admitted that\r\nReconstruction was a failure. On the contrary, those who will\r\ncarefully read what I wrote will not fail to see that my contention is\r\nthat in its important and essential particulars that policy was a\r\ngrand and brilliant success and I instanced the ratification of the\r\n14th and 15th Amendments, neither of which could have otherwise been\r\nratified, as a vindication of the wisdom of that legislation even if\r\nnothing else had resulted from it. It is admitted that some of the\r\nfriends and supporters of the Congressional plan of Reconstruction\r\nhave been disappointed because those governments did not and could not\r\nstand the test of time. To this extent and for this reason some\r\npersons claim that the policy was a failure. I am not one of that\r\nnumber, the reasons for which the readers of the article referred to\r\nwill see. But the inability of those governments to stand the test of\r\ntime I accounted for under three heads, one of which was several\r\nunfortunate decisions rendered by the Supreme Court, the result, in my\r\nopinion, of two unwise appointments made by President Grant in the\r\npersons of Chief Justice Waite and Associate Justice Bradley. I do not\r\nassert that those two judges, or any others, for that matter, were\r\nappointed with reference to their attitude upon any public question,\r\nstill I am satisfied that they were believed to be in accord with the\r\nother leaders and constitutional lawyers in the Republican party in\r\ntheir construction of the 14th Amendment. The constitutional warrant\r\nfor the Civil Rights Bill is the clause which declares that \"no state\r\nshall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or\r\nimmunities of citizens of the United States.\" It was therefore held\r\nthat any law or ordinance which provided for, recognized or sanctioned\r\nseparate facilities for the two races in the exercise and enjoyment of\r\nthe rights and privileges that are supposed to be common to all\r\nclasses of persons, would be a violation of this provision of the 14th\r\nAmendment; and since Congress was authorized to enforce the Amendment,\r\naffirmative legislation for the enforcement of that provision was held\r\nto be thus warranted. This view was held by such able and brilliant\r\nconstitutional lawyers as Edmunds and Conkling in the Senate, and\r\nButler, George F. and E. Rockwood Hoar, Lyman Tremaine, Garfield and\r\nWilson in the House. Senator Carpenter was the only Republican lawyer\r\nof any note that took a different view of the matter. While he\r\nbelieved the whole bill was unconstitutional, the section prohibiting\r\nrace discrimination in the selection of jurors in State courts he\r\nbelieved to be especially obnoxious to the constitution. He declared\r\nthat if that section could stand the test of a judicial decision all\r\nthe others could and should. And yet the court, through a decision\r\nhanded down by Mr. Justice Strong, affirmed the constitutionality of\r\nthat section, but in a decision delivered by Mr. Justice Bradley the\r\nsection providing for equal accommodations in hotels, inns and places\r\nof amusement was declared unconstitutional except in the District of\r\nColumbia and the territories. In several subsequent decisions, giving\r\nin the main the opinion of Chief Justice Waite, some of the most vital\r\nand important sections of the enforcement acts, especially those\r\nhaving for their object the protection of individual citizens, through\r\nfederal machinery, when necessary, against domestic violence, were\r\nalso declared to be unconstitutional and void.\r\n\r\nI am of the opinion, shared in by many others, that if men of the type\r\nof Edmunds and Conkling had been appointed Supreme Court Justices\r\ninstead of Waite and Bradley, the rulings of the court in the\r\nimportant cases referred to might have been, and I think would have\r\nbeen, different. The unfortunate thing about those decisions is the\r\nwide scope of authority thus conceded to the States. In other words,\r\nthey amount to a judicial recognition of the dangerous doctrine of\r\nStates Rights--a doctrine which has been the source and the cause of\r\nmost of our domestic troubles and misfortunes since those decisions\r\nwere rendered. But for those unfortunate decisions our country would\r\nnot be cursed and disgraced today by lynch law and other forms of\r\nlawlessness and racial proscription and discrimination. But for those\r\nunfortunate decisions lynchings could have been and I am sure would\r\nhave been held to be an offense against the peace and dignity of the\r\nUnited States as well as the State in which the crime is committed.\r\nConsequently, the criminals could be, and in most cases would be,\r\nprosecuted in the United States courts, as was done in the case of\r\nmany of the leaders of that secret criminal organization called the Ku\r\nKlux Klan. But this took place before the decisions referred to were\r\nrendered. The court has also decided that a State law providing\r\nseparate accommodations for white and colored people on railroad\r\ntrains, at least for a passenger whose journey begins and ends in the\r\nsame state, is not an abridgment in violation of the constitution,\r\nprovided the accommodations for the two races are exactly equal. This\r\nmeans that the validity even of those laws will not be affirmed\r\nwhenever it can be shown that the accommodations are not equal, which\r\ncan be very easily done. _Equal_ separate accommodations are both a\r\nphysical and a financial impossibility. It is simply impossible for a\r\nrailroad company to provide the same accommodations for one colored\r\npassenger that it provides for one hundred whites. If, then, a colored\r\npassenger cannot occupy a seat or a sleeping berth in a car in which\r\nwhite persons may be passengers, this will not only be an abridgment,\r\nbut in some cases, an absolute denial of such accommodations. The\r\nultimate nullification of such unfair, unjust and unreasonable laws\r\nmust necessarily follow.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the unfavorable rulings of the court, as above noted,\r\nthat tribunal, as at present constituted, has rendered several very\r\nimportant decisions which have given the friends of national supremacy\r\nand equal rights much hope and encouragement, the most important of\r\nwhich is the one declaring unconstitutional and void the ordinances\r\nproviding for the segregation of the races in the purchase and\r\noccupation of property for residential purposes in several cities. The\r\ndecision in this case was broad, comprehensive and far-reaching. This\r\nimportant, fair and equitable decision has given the colored American\r\nnew hope and new inspiration. It has strengthened and intensified his\r\nloyalty and devotion to his country, his government, its flag and its\r\ninstitutions. It makes him feel that with all of its faults and\r\nshortcomings, our _form_ of government is superior to, and better than\r\nthat of any other, and that by a few more decisions along the line of\r\nthis one, which I hope and believe may be safely anticipated, every\r\njustifiable cause of complaint on the part of the Negro will have been\r\nremoved, because the evils resulting from the unfavorable and\r\nunfortunate rulings above noted will have been remedied and cured. Our\r\ntype of democracy will then be what it now purports to be, pure and\r\ngenuine. It will then be in truth and in fact the land of the free and\r\nthe home of the brave. It will then be a typical representative of\r\nthat form of democracy under which there can be no slave, no vassal\r\nand no peon, but every one will be an equal before the law in the\r\nexercise and enjoyment of life, liberty and property and in the\r\nexercise and enjoyment of such public rights and privileges as are, or\r\nshould be, common to all citizens alike, without distinction or\r\ndiscrimination based upon differences of race, color, nationality or\r\nreligion. These were the aims the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment\r\nhad in view when that Amendment was drawn, and from present\r\nindications it seems to be clear that the highest court in the land\r\nwill not allow the same to be defeated.\r\n\r\nBut the most significant point about the segregation decision grows\r\nout of the fact that the fair, reasonable, sound and equitable\r\nprinciples therein set forth and clearly enunciated received the\r\napprobation and endorsement of a unanimous court consisting of nine\r\nJudges in which conflicting and antagonistic political views are\r\npresumed to be represented. This indicates that the day is not far off\r\nwhen the so-called race question will cease to be a political factor,\r\nand that all political parties will recognize merit and not race,\r\nfitness and not color, experience and not religion, ability and not\r\nnationality as the tests by which persons must be judged, not only in\r\nthe administration of the government but in the industrial field as\r\nwell. For the accomplishment of these desirable purposes, men of the\r\ntype of James Ford Rhodes should give their support instead of\r\nallowing the same to be used in the interest of that small class of\r\nunpatriotic Americans who seek political distinction and official\r\nrecognition at the expense of racial harmony and brotherly love.\r\n\r\n                                   JOHN B.

He was educated at Hampden-Sidney and\r\nWilliam and Mary College, having as classmates Lieutenant-General\r\nScott, President John Tyler, Senator William S. Archer and Mr. Justice\r\nBaldwin, of the Supreme Court of the United States. At the age of\r\ntwenty-three his father had bequeathed him a large plantation with a\r\nnumber of slaves. \"Of a polished education, fine personal appearance,\r\ngood manners and irreproachable character,\"[231] he so impressed\r\nPresident Madison that he made him his private secretary in 1809. In\r\nthis position he became well informed in public affairs and useful to\r\nthe President.\r\n\r\nEarly in Coles' college days he discussed with himself the question as\r\nto whether the declaration that \"all men are born free and equal\"\r\ncould be harmonized with slavery. He reached the conclusion that the\r\ninstitution should not exist in a country claiming to be a democracy.\r\nHe, therefore, resolved that he would not hold slaves and would not\r\nlive in a slave-holding State.\r\n\r\nEnjoying the confidence of Jefferson, Coles took up with him the\r\nimportant question of emancipating his slaves in the year 1814. The\r\nletter follows:\r\n\r\n               EDWARD COLES TO THOMAS JEFFERSON\r\n\r\n                                  WASHINGTON, July 31, 1814.\r\n\r\n     _Dear Sir_:--I never took up my pen with more hesitation, or felt\r\n     more embarrassment than I now do in addressing you on the\r\n     subject of this letter. The fear of appearing presumptuous\r\n     distresses me, and would deter me from venturing thus to call\r\n     your attention to a subject of such magnitude, and so beset with\r\n     difficulties as that of a general emancipation of the slaves of\r\n     Virginia, had I not the highest opinion of your goodness and\r\n     liberality, in not only excusing me for the liberty I take, but\r\n     in justly appreciating my motives in doing so.\r\n\r\n     I will not enter on the _right_ which man has to enslave his\r\n     brother man, nor upon the moral and political effects of slavery\r\n     on individuals or on society; because these things are better\r\n     understood by you than by me. My object is to entreat and beseech\r\n     you to exert your knowledge and influence in devising and getting\r\n     into operation some plan for the gradual emancipation of slavery.\r\n     This difficult task could be less exceptionally and more\r\n     successfully performed by the revered fathers of all our\r\n     political and social blessings than by any succeeding statesmen;\r\n     and would seem to come with peculiar propriety and force from\r\n     those whose valor, wisdom and virtue have done so much in\r\n     ameliorating the condition of mankind. And it is a duty, as I\r\n     conceive, that devolves particularly on you, from your known\r\n     philosophical and enlarged view of subjects, and from the\r\n     principles you have professed and practiced through a long and\r\n     useful life, pre-eminently distinguished as well by being\r\n     foremost in establishing on the broadest basis the rights of man,\r\n     and the liberty and independence of your country, as in being\r\n     throughout honored with the most important trusts of your fellow\r\n     citizens, whose confidence and love you have carried with you\r\n     into the shades of old age and retirement. In the calm of this\r\n     retirement you might, most beneficially to society, and with much\r\n     addition to your own fame, avail yourself of that love and\r\n     confidence to put into complete practice those hallowed\r\n     principles contained in that renowned Declaration, of which you\r\n     were the immortal author, and on which we founded our right to\r\n     resist oppression and establish our freedom and independence.\r\n\r\n     I hope the fear of failing, at this time, will have no influence\r\n     in preventing you from employing your pen to eradicate this most\r\n     degrading feature of British Colonial policy, which is still\r\n     permitted to exist, notwithstanding its repugnance as well to the\r\n     principles of our revolution as to our free institutions. For\r\n     however prized and influential your opinions may now be, they\r\n     will still be much more so when you shall have been taken from us\r\n     by the course of nature. If, therefore, your attempt should now\r\n     fail to rectify this unfortunate evil--an evil most injurious\r\n     both to the oppressed and to the oppressor--at some future day\r\n     when your memory will be consecrated by a grateful posterity,\r\n     what influence, irresistible influence will the opinions and\r\n     writings of Thomas Jefferson have in all questions connected with\r\n     the rights of man, and of that policy which will be the creed of\r\n     your disciples. Permit men then, my dear Sir, again to entreat\r\n     your great powers of mind and influence, and to employ some of\r\n     your present leisure, in devising a mode to liberate one-half of\r\n     our fellow beings from an ignominious bondage to the other,\r\n     either by making an immediate attempt to put in train a plan to\r\n     commence this goodly work, or to leave human nature the\r\n     invaluable Testament--which you are so capable of doing--how best\r\n     to establish its rights; so that the weight of your opinion may\r\n     be on the side of emancipation when that question shall be\r\n     agitated, and that it will be sooner or later is most certain.\r\n     That it may be soon is my most ardent prayer--that it will be,\r\n     rests with you.\r\n\r\n     I will only add as an excuse for the liberty I take in addressing\r\n     you on this subject which is so particularly interesting to me,\r\n     that from the time I was capable of reflecting on the nature of\r\n     political society, and of the rights appertaining to man, I have\r\n     not only been principled against slavery, but have had feelings\r\n     so repugnant to it as to decide me not to hold them; which\r\n     decision has forced me to leave my native State, and with it all\r\n     my relations and friends. This, I hope, will be deemed by you\r\n     some excuse for the liberty of this intrusion, of which I gladly\r\n     avail myself to assure you of the very great respect and esteem\r\n     with which I am, my dear Sir, your very sincere and devoted\r\n     friend,[232]\r\n\r\n                                   EDWARD COLES.\r\n\r\nHe wrote Jefferson the following concerning the same question about\r\ntwo months later:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   WASHINGTON, Sep. 26th, '14.\r\n\r\n     I must be permitted again to trouble you, my dear Sir, to return\r\n     my grateful thanks for the respectful and friendly attention\r\n     shown to my letter in your answer of the 25th ult. Your favorable\r\n     reception of sentiments not generally avowed, if felt, by our\r\n     countrymen, but which have ever been so inseparably interwoven\r\n     with my opinions and feelings as to become, as it were, the\r\n     rudder that shapes my course, even against a strong tide of\r\n     interest and of local partialities, could not but be in the\r\n     highest degree gratifying to me. And your interesting and highly\r\n     prized letter conveying them to me in such flattering terms,\r\n     would have called forth my acknowledgments before this but for\r\n     its having been forwarded to me to the Springs, and from thence\r\n     it was again returned here before I received it, which was only a\r\n     few days since.\r\n\r\n     Your indulgent treatment encourages me to add that I feel very\r\n     sensibly the force of your remarks on the impropriety of yielding\r\n     to my repugnancies in abandoning my property in slaves and my\r\n     native State. I certainly should never have been inclined to\r\n     yield to them if I had supposed myself capable of being\r\n     instrumental in bringing about a liberation, or that I could by\r\n     my example ameliorate the condition of these oppressed people. If\r\n     I could be convinced of being in the slightest degree useful in\r\n     doing either, it would afford me very great happiness, and the\r\n     more so as it would enable me to gratify many partialities by\r\n     remaining in Virginia. But never having flattered myself with the\r\n     hope of being able to contribute to either, I have long since\r\n     determined, and should but for my bad health ere this, have\r\n     removed, carrying along with me those who had been my slaves, to\r\n     the country north-west of the river Ohio.\r\n\r\n     Your prayers I trust will not only be heard with indulgence in\r\n     Heaven, but with influence on Earth. But I cannot agree with you\r\n     that they are the only weapons of one at your age; nor that the\r\n     difficult work of cleansing the escutcheon of Virginia of the\r\n     foul stain of slavery can best be done by the young. To expect so\r\n     great and difficult an object, great and extensive powers, both\r\n     of mind and influence, are required, which can never be possessed\r\n     in so great a degree by the young as by the old. And among the\r\n     few of the former who might unite the disposition with the\r\n     requisite capacity, they are too often led by ambitious views to\r\n     go with the current of popular feeling rather than to mark out a\r\n     course for themselves, where they might be buffeted by the waves\r\n     of opposition; and indeed it is feared that these waves would in\r\n     this case be too strong to be effectually resisted by any but\r\n     those who had gained by a previous course of useful employment\r\n     the firmest footing in the confidence and attachment of their\r\n     country. It is with them, therefore, I am persuaded, that the\r\n     subject of emancipation must originate; for they are the only\r\n     persons who have it in their power effectually to arouse and\r\n     enlighten the public sentiment, which in matters of this kind\r\n     ought not to be expected to lead, but to be led; nor ought it to\r\n     be wondered at that there should prevail a degree of apathy with\r\n     the general mass of mankind, where a mere passive principle of\r\n     right has to contend against the weighty influence of habit and\r\n     interest. On such a question there will always exist in society a\r\n     kind of _vis inertia_, to arouse and overcome, which requires a\r\n     strong impulse, which can only be given by those who have\r\n     acquired a great weight of character, and on whom there devolves\r\n     in this case a most solemn obligation. It was under these\r\n     impressions that I looked to you, my dear Sir, as the first of\r\n     our aged worthies to awaken our fellow-citizens from their\r\n     infatuation to a proper sense of justice, and to the true\r\n     interest of their country; and by proposing a system for the\r\n     gradual emancipation of our slaves, at once to form a rallying\r\n     point for its friends, who, enlightened by your wisdom and\r\n     experience, and supported and encouraged by your sanction and\r\n     patronage, might look forward to a propitious and happy result.\r\n     Your time of life I had not considered as an obstacle to the\r\n     undertaking. Doctor Franklin, to whom, by the way, Pennsylvania\r\n     owes her early riddance of the evils of slavery, was as actively\r\n     and as usefully employed on as arduous duties after he had past\r\n     your age as he had ever been at any period of his life.\r\n\r\n     With apologizing for having given you so much trouble on this\r\n     subject, and again repeating my thanks for the respectful and\r\n     flattering attention you have been pleased to pay to it, I renew\r\n     the assurances of the great respect and regard which makes me\r\n     most sincerely yours\r\n\r\n                                   EDWARD COLES.\r\n\r\nColes went west to find a suitable location for settlement but was\r\ndelayed in carrying out the enterprise by serving on a special mission\r\nto Russia in 1816. He then moved in 1819 to Edwardsville, Illinois,\r\nwhere he emancipated his slaves. Arriving in that State just at the\r\ntime its citizens were trying to decide whether or not that\r\ncommonwealth should be a slave or free State, this anti-slavery man\r\nturned the tide in favor of freedom. He had been in the State only\r\nthree years when he was nominated by the anti-slavery party for\r\ngovernor. He received a minority of the votes cast at the election in\r\n1822; but owing to a split in the pro-slavery party which divided its\r\nvotes between two candidates, Coles was elected, although the friends\r\nof slavery elected their candidate for lieutenant-governor and a\r\nmajority of the members of both branches of the legislature. There\r\nensued then a struggle to have a convention called so to change the\r\nconstitution as to make Illinois a slave State.\r\n\r\nJudge Gillespie, a contemporary, described the situation as follows:\r\n\r\n     It was conceded in those days that a State formed out of the\r\n     \"North West Territory\" could not be _admitted_ into the Union\r\n     contrary to the provisions of the ordinance of 1787, which\r\n     prohibited slavery, but the slavery propagandists contended that\r\n     you could, the next day after being admitted under an\r\n     _anti-slavery_ constitution, change the constitution so as to\r\n     admit slavery, and in that way, \"whip the devil around the\r\n     stump.\" It was likewise contended that slavery existed in\r\n     Illinois beyond Congressional interference, by virtue of the\r\n     treaty (of 1763) between France and England, and that between\r\n     England and the United States at the close of the Revolutionary\r\n     War, in both of which the rights of the French inhabitants were\r\n     guaranteed. One of these rights was that of holding slaves,\r\n     which, it was contended, was protected by treaty stipulation, and\r\n     was equal in binding effect, to the Constitution (of the United\r\n     States) itself. Besides, it was maintained, that by the conquest\r\n     of George Rogers Clark, this country became a part of Virginia,\r\n     and that Congress had no more power to abolish slavery in\r\n     Illinois, than it had in Virginia. The logic of the times was\r\n     that the French inhabitants had the right to hold slaves, and\r\n     that the other inhabitants had equal rights with the\r\n     French--ergo: they all had the right to hold slaves. This was the\r\n     argument of the celebrated constitutional expounder--John\r\n     Grammar, of Union county--in the Legislature in reply to an\r\n     intimation questioning the validity of the title of slaves in\r\n     Illinois. The old gentleman instantly arose and remarked \"that\r\n     fittener men\" than he was \"mout hev been found to defend the\r\n     masters agin the sneakin' ways of the infernal abolitioners; but\r\n     havin' rights on my side, I don't fear, Sir. I will show that are\r\n     proposition is unconstitutionable, inlegal, and fornenst the\r\n     compact. Don't every one know, or leastwise had ought to know,\r\n     that the Congress that sot at _Post Vinsan_, garnisheed to the\r\n     old French inhabitants the right to their niggers, and haint I\r\n     got as much rights as any Frenchman in this State? Answer me\r\n     that, Sir.\" Notwithstanding this seeming confidence, these men\r\n     were exceedingly desirous of reinforcing their rights. They\r\n     resorted to the indenturing method, by which they got their\r\n     servant to go before some officer and bind himself to serve the\r\n     master, generally for ninety-nine years, for which he was to\r\n     receive a slight equivalent at the end of each year.\r\n\r\n     As the \"Yankees\" increased in numbers, confidence (on the part of\r\n     the pro-slavery men) in the titles to their negroes, diminished,\r\n     and they finally concluded that there was no assurance for them,\r\n     except in changing the constitution so as to sanction\r\n     slaveholding and thus the contest commenced, which for fierceness\r\n     and rancor excelled anything ever before witnessed. The people\r\n     were at the point of going to war with each other. The\r\n     pro-slavery men were, as they have always been ready to resort to\r\n     violence wherever they dared, unwilling to listen to, or\r\n     incapable of comprehending arguments. Their method of overcoming\r\n     opposition was by \"buldozing\"; but on this occasion they had to\r\n     encounter men of invincible courage, who were eager and willing\r\n     to 'beard the lion in his den,' and defend their rights at all\r\n     hazards. Many of these men had removed to Illinois to get rid of\r\n     the curse of slavery.\r\n\r\nThis scheme, however, was with much difficulty defeated and the State\r\nwas saved for freedom. The intensity of this struggle has been well\r\ndescribed by Governor Reynolds in his _My Own Times_. He says:\r\n\r\n     The convention question gave rise to two years of the most\r\n     furious and boisterous excitement and contest that ever was\r\n     visited on Illinois. Men, women and children entered the arena of\r\n     party warfare and strife, and the families and neighborhoods were\r\n     so divided and furious and bitter against one another, that it\r\n     seemed a regular civil war might be the result. Many personal\r\n     combats were indulged in on the question, and the whole country\r\n     seemed, at times, to be ready and willing to resort to physical\r\n     force to decide the contest. All the means known to man to convey\r\n     ideas to one another were resorted to, and practised with energy.\r\n     The press teemed with publications on the subject. The\r\n     stump-orators were invoked, and the pulpit thundered anathemas\r\n     against the introduction of slavery. The religious community\r\n     coupled freedom and Christianity together, which was one of the\r\n     most powerful levers used in the content. At one meeting of the\r\n     friends of freedom in St. Clair county, more than thirty\r\n     preachers of the gospel attended and opposed the introduction of\r\n     slavery into the State.\r\n\r\nThis contest has been further described by W. H. Brown. He says:\r\n\r\n     The struggle which now commenced, and was continued through the\r\n     succeeding eighteen months, was one of no ordinary character. Our\r\n     previous elections had been conducted with warmth and zeal; but\r\n     into this canvass was infused a bitterness and malignity which\r\n     the agitation of the Slavery question only engenders. Why it\r\n     always produces this result, is worthy of the investigation of\r\n     the moralist and philosopher. Other great evils, political or\r\n     moral, are discussed with freedom, and measures for their\r\n     amelioration or prevention meet with no outward opposition; but\r\n     call in question the right of one man to enslave another, or even\r\n     make an effort to confine this gigantic sin to the territory in\r\n     which it exists, and the fiercest passions are aroused in the\r\n     hearts of its advocates, and the lack of power alone, saves their\r\n     opponents from utter destruction.\r\n\r\n     In this spirit was the contest of 1823-4 waged. Old friendships\r\n     were sundered, families divided and neighborhoods arrayed in\r\n     opposition to each other. Threats of personal violence were\r\n     frequent, and personal collisions a frequent occurrence. As in\r\n     times of warfare, every man expected an attack, and was prepared\r\n     to meet it. Pistols and dirks were in great demand, and formed a\r\n     part of the personal habiliments of all those conspicuous for\r\n     their opposition to the Convention measure. Even the gentler sex\r\n     came within the vortex of this whirlwind of passion; and many\r\n     were the angry disputations of those whose cares and interests\r\n     were usually confined to their household duties.\r\n\r\nIt will doubtless be profitable, therefore, to study the following\r\nletters showing Governor Coles' connection with the anti-slavery\r\nmovement during the early history of Illinois.\r\n\r\n\r\n               GOVERNOR COLES TO RICHARD FLOWERS\r\n\r\n     _Dear Sir_:--I would have made my acknowledgments to you long\r\n     since for your kind letter of 13th of February, but for my having\r\n     been prevented from writing by the bearer of it, from the haste\r\n     with which he took his departure hence, and for my being much\r\n     harassed by the business attendant on the approaching\r\n     adjournment of the Legislature; and for my having gone soon\r\n     after the adjournment to Edwardsville, where I was detained until\r\n     a few days since by torrents of rain which have deluged the\r\n     country and rendered the streams and roads impassable. The\r\n     perusal of your letter afforded me particular pleasure. It\r\n     breathes the genuine sentiments of a Republican and of a\r\n     philanthropist; and produced an emotion which was \"pleasing\r\n     though mournful to the soul.\" Pleasing that an adopted citizen\r\n     should possess principles so entirely accordant with our free\r\n     institutions; and as it held out encouragement that the people\r\n     would not sanction the late conduct and measures of their\r\n     Representatives--mournful, that if the slave faction should\r\n     succeed, how unpleasant and truly unfortunate the situation of\r\n     many of us, who have removed from a great distance and invested\r\n     our all in property which we shall be compelled to abandon or to\r\n     sacrifice, to seek new homes we know not where; or remain in a\r\n     community whose principles and practice are not only entirely at\r\n     variance with our own, but of a character calculated daily to\r\n     harrow up our feelings in the most painful way. I was born in the\r\n     very bosom of negro slavery; have seen it in all its bearings;\r\n     reflected well upon the nature of it, and having found it\r\n     impossible to reconcile it either with my political or religious\r\n     creed, I abandoned my native State, my aged parents and\r\n     relations, to seek in this State a community whose principles and\r\n     practice I presumed were in unison with my own. Judge, then, of\r\n     my feelings at the efforts which have been made and are now\r\n     making to change this free community of ours into a truly odious\r\n     one, consisting of masters and slaves--and you can judge the\r\n     better as your situation and principles are very similar with\r\n     mine. The great inducement with us both to emigrate to this State\r\n     was the firm belief that we should not be disturbed by the\r\n     clanking of the fetters of Slavery; that tyranny would not be\r\n     given a legal sanction, nor afforded the food on which it could\r\n     prey. But the majority of the people's representatives, having by\r\n     the most violent and unprecedented measure, taken a step with the\r\n     view of breaking down those barriers to oppression, which had\r\n     been erected by the wisdom and virtue of those who framed the\r\n     fundamental law of the State, and which you and many of us\r\n     considered, if not sacred, at least to have been permanently\r\n     settled, it becomes us to be on the alert to defeat a measure,\r\n     which if it should succeed, will not only be ruinous, and in the\r\n     highest degree unjust to many of us who have emigrated here under\r\n     the most solemn assurance that \"neither slavery nor involuntary\r\n     servitude\" should exist; but it will be of incalculable injury to\r\n     the interest of the State, of the Union, and of the extension and\r\n     advancement of freedom, and the amelioration of the human race.\r\n\r\n     You reside in a favorable situation to aid with effect this great\r\n     question. The county just below you forms the dividing line\r\n     between the sections of country in which the free and slave\r\n     parties predominate. It has occurred to me that the friends of\r\n     freedom would give ample support, and that the good cause would\r\n     be greatly promoted by establishing a printing press on the\r\n     Eastern side of the State. And I know of no place where it could\r\n     be established to so much advantage, as at Albion. Besides the\r\n     advantage it has in locality, there are in Albion, and its\r\n     vicinity, many persons who wield chaste and powerful pens, and\r\n     who have the means, and, I trust, the disposition of patronizing\r\n     an establishment of the kind. Pardon me for asking it as a favor\r\n     to me personally, and as a sacrifice to the furtherance of the\r\n     best and most virtuous of causes, that all personal, sectional,\r\n     national, county or town feelings, and all other unkind feelings,\r\n     let them originate from what cause they may, shall be buried, at\r\n     least while the great question is pending. I will write and ask\r\n     the same favor of Mr. Birkbeck. I have but little news. From all\r\n     I can learn a considerable majority of the people of the counties\r\n     situated in the north-west part of the State, as far south as\r\n     Monroe, St. Clair and Washington, are opposed to a call of a\r\n     convention, but great and extraordinary efforts are already\r\n     making to induce the people to vote for it.\r\n\r\n     Present my respectful compliments to Mrs. F. and family, and to\r\n     your son and his lady, and be assured of my respect and esteem.\r\n\r\n                                   EDWARD COLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n               GOVERNOR COLES TO NICHOLAS BIDDLE\r\n\r\n     _Dear Sir_:--It has been a long time since I either wrote to you\r\n     or heard from you. I made a visit last summer to my relations in\r\n     Virginia, and intended to have extended my tour as far as\r\n     Philadelphia, which I should certainly have done, for I am still\r\n     more attached to Philadelphia than any other city in the Union,\r\n     but for my trip having been delayed by a severe attack of bilious\r\n     fever, and having been prolonged in Virginia beyond the time I\r\n     expected, and the necessity I was under to be back here by the\r\n     meeting of the Legislature, to enter on the duties of the office\r\n     to which I had been recently elected. I assure you, when about to\r\n     leave Washington (where I staid only four or five days) and to\r\n     turn my face to the west, there was a great struggle between a\r\n     sense of duty which dragged me here, and my inclinations and many\r\n     strong attractions which drew me to your charming city. There has\r\n     long existed in this State a strong party in favor of altering\r\n     the constitution and making it a slave-holding State; while there\r\n     is another party in favor of a convention to alter the\r\n     constitution, but deny that Slavery is their object. These two\r\n     parties have finally, by the most unprecedented and unwarrantable\r\n     proceedings (an account of which you have no doubt seen in the\r\n     newspapers), succeeded in passing a resolution requiring the\r\n     sense of the people to be taken at the next general election\r\n     (August, 1824), on the propriety of calling a convention for the\r\n     purpose of altering the constitution. Knowing that this measure\r\n     would be strenuously urged during the late session of the\r\n     Legislature, and that many who professed to be hostile to the\r\n     further introduction of Slavery, would advocate it, and believing\r\n     that it would have a salutary effect to furnish them an\r\n     opportunity of evincing the sincerity of their professions; and\r\n     being also urged by a strong sense of the obligations imposed on\r\n     me, by my principles and feelings, to take notice of the subject,\r\n     I called the attention of the Legislature in a speech I delivered\r\n     on being sworn into office (a printed copy of which I sent you by\r\n     mail) to the existence of Slavery in the State, in violation of\r\n     the great fundamental principles of the ordinance, and\r\n     recommended that just and equitable provision be made for its\r\n     abrogation. As I anticipated, this part of my speech created a\r\n     considerable excitement with those who were openly or secretly in\r\n     favor of making Illinois a slave-holding, rather than making it\r\n     really as well as nominally, a free State--who wished to fill it\r\n     rather than empty it of slaves. Never did I see or hear in\r\n     America of party spirit going to such lengths, as well officially\r\n     as privately, as it did here on this question. Indeed, it seems\r\n     to me that Slavery is so poisonous as to produce a kind of\r\n     delirium in those minds who are excited by it. This question, and\r\n     the manner of carrying it, is exciting great interest throughout\r\n     the State, and has already kindled an extraordinary degree of\r\n     excitement and warmth of feeling, which will no doubt continue to\r\n     increase until the question is decided. I assure you, I never\r\n     before felt so deep an interest in any political question. It\r\n     preys upon me to such a degree, that I shall not be happy or feel\r\n     at ease until it is settled. It is impossible to foresee the\r\n     injurious effects resulting to this State of the unhappy\r\n     consequences which may arise to the Union, from the success of\r\n     the slave party in this State. Many of us who immigrated to this\r\n     State under the solemn assurance that there should exist here\r\n     \"neither slavery nor involuntary servitude,\" will, if the slave\r\n     faction succeeds, be compelled to sacrifice or abandon our\r\n     property and seek new homes, we know not where, or remain in a\r\n     community whose principles we shall disapprove of, and whose\r\n     practice will be abhorrent to our feelings. And already we hear\r\n     disputed the binding effect of the ordinance--the power of\r\n     Congress to restrict a State, etc., etc., from which I fear, if\r\n     the introduction of Slavery should be tolerated here, the\r\n     discussions on the expediency and unconstitutionality of the\r\n     measure will not in all probability be confined to the citizens\r\n     of this State. But this is a part of the question too painful for\r\n     me to dwell on. I trust the good sense and virtue of the citizens\r\n     of Illinois will never sanction a measure so well calculated to\r\n     disturb the harmony of the Union and so injurious to its own\r\n     prosperity and happiness, as well as so directly opposite to the\r\n     progress of those enlightened and liberal principles which do\r\n     honor to the age. But to insure this it is necessary that the\r\n     public mind should be enlightened on the moral and political\r\n     effects of Slavery. You will confer a particular favor on me and\r\n     promote the virtuous cause in which I am enlisted, by giving me\r\n     information, or referring me to the sources from whence I can\r\n     draw it, calculated to elucidate the general character and\r\n     effects of Slavery--its moral, political and social\r\n     effects--facts showing its effects on the price of lands, and\r\n     general improvement and appearance of a country--of labor both as\r\n     it respects agriculture and manufactures, etc., etc. The State of\r\n     Pennsylvania having been long distinguished for its attachment to\r\n     free principles, there is no doubt but what you can procure in\r\n     Philadelphia many valuable pamphlets and publications which would\r\n     throw light on this question. Any which you may have it in your\r\n     power to procure and forward, will be most thankfully received,\r\n     and the amount of the expense repaid as soon as it is known. Your\r\n     old and truly sincere friend,\r\n\r\n                                        EDWARD COLES.\r\n\r\n     TO NICHOLAS BIDDLE, ESQ.,\r\n       PRESIDENT OF THE BANK OF THE UNITED STATES,\r\n          PHILADELPHIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n               MR. BIDDLE TO GOVERNOR COLES\r\n\r\n                              PHILADELPHIA, May 20, 1823.\r\n\r\n     _Dear Sir:_ I have just received your friendly letter of the 22nd\r\n     ult., to which I shall take the first moment of leisure to give a\r\n     more detailed answer. In the meantime I can only say that I feel\r\n     most sincerely the embarrassment of your situation, and hope that\r\n     you may be able to triumph in the good cause. That no effort may\r\n     be wanting, you shall have all the assistance which I can give or\r\n     procure. My occupations necessarily absorb so much of my time\r\n     that I can promise you little on my part, personally, but I have\r\n     already engaged two of our most active gentlemen familiar with\r\n     that subject, who will cheerfully and zealously contribute to\r\n     your support. The first fruit of their labor is the pamphlet\r\n     accompanying this letter. I have not had time to read it, as I am\r\n     anxious to forward it without delay, but I understand that it is\r\n     the latest and best work on the subject, and goes directly to the\r\n     question of the superiority of free over slave labor. Mrs. B. and\r\n     Mr. Craig are glad to hear of your prosperity, and desire to be\r\n     particularly remembered to you.\r\n\r\n     With great sincerity of regard,\r\n                             yrs.,\r\n                                      N. BIDDLE.\r\n\r\n     EDWARD COLES, ESQ.,\r\n       Vandalia.\r\n\r\n\r\n               MR. BIDDLE TO GOVERNOR COLES\r\n\r\n                              PHILADELPHIA, May 26, 1823.\r\n\r\n     _My Dear Sir:_ My present occupations necessarily engross so much\r\n     of my time that I can scarcely contribute more than my good\r\n     wishes to the great cause which so naturally and deeply interests\r\n     you. It gives me peculiar satisfaction, therefore, to procure for\r\n     you the correspondence of my friend, Mr. Roberts Vaux, to whom\r\n     this note is intended to serve as an introduction. Mr. Vaux is a\r\n     gentleman of education, talents, fortune, leisure and high\r\n     standing in the community. He feels sensibly all the\r\n     embarrassments of your situation; he perceives the deep\r\n     importance of defeating this first effort to extend to the\r\n     north-western country the misfortunes of the slave population and\r\n     he is disposed to co-operate warmly and zealously with you. I\r\n     know of no individual more calculated to render you the most\r\n     efficient service. He is worthy of all your confidence, and I\r\n     recommend to you to yield it to him implicitly, as I am sure it\r\n     will be repaid by every kindness and every service in his power.\r\n\r\n     With great esteem and regard,\r\n                             yrs.,\r\n                                        N. BIDDLE.\r\n\r\n     EDWARD COLES, ESQ.,\r\n       Vandalia,\r\n         Illinois.\r\n\r\n\r\n               MR. BIDDLE TO GOVERNOR COLES\r\n\r\n                              PHILADELPHIA, May 26, 1823.\r\n\r\n     _My Dear Sir:_ I have put into the hands of my friend, Mr. Vaux,\r\n     a note for you which he will accompany with a communication on\r\n     the subject which now occupies you. Mr. Vaux will be hearty and\r\n     zealous in the cause, and I really deem it a subject of\r\n     congratulation to you, to procure the assistance of one who is\r\n     more able and willing than any individual of my acquaintance to\r\n     assist you. There is one thing which I wish to add. The Abolition\r\n     Society of this city, has been the subject, whether justly or not\r\n     I am unable to determine, of much hostility at a distance, and it\r\n     would be rather injurious than beneficial to have it supposed\r\n     that the society was active in the cause which you are\r\n     supporting. You will therefore understand that neither the\r\n     Abolition Society nor any other society has the least concern in\r\n     this matter. The simple fact is that Mr. Vaux, and two or three\r\n     of his friends, have been so much pleased with your past conduct\r\n     in relation to Slavery, and have so deep a sense of their duty to\r\n     resist the extension of that system, that they mean to volunteer\r\n     in assisting you, without any connections with any set of men,\r\n     and without any motives which the most honorable might not be\r\n     proud to avow.\r\n\r\n                   Very sincerely,\r\n                               yrs.,\r\n                                      N. BIDDLE.\r\n\r\n     EDWARD COLES, ESQ.,\r\n       Vandalia,\r\n         Illinois.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PHILADELPHIA, 5 Mo. 27, 1823.\r\n\r\n     TO EDWARD COLES, ESQ.:\r\n\r\n     _Esteemed Friend:_--My friend, Nicholas Biddle, has kindly\r\n     furnished me with a note of introduction to thy correspondence,\r\n     which is transmitted by the mail that conveys this letter. I\r\n     have been induced thus to solicit access to thy notice, because\r\n     thy conduct in relation to the emancipation of thy slaves could\r\n     not fail to beget great respect for an individual whose noble,\r\n     and generous example displayed so much practical wisdom, and\r\n     Christian benevolence. Nor has it been less gratifying to be\r\n     informed of thy official efforts to prevent the overthrow of\r\n     those constitutional barriers, which were erected to protect the\r\n     State of Illinois, from the moral, and political evils\r\n     inseparable from domestic slavery.\r\n\r\n     It is really astonishing, that any part of the inhabitants of\r\n     your State should wish to introduce a system which is generally\r\n     reprobated where its effects have been longest known, and from\r\n     the dominion of which, such of our fellow citizens of the South\r\n     as are disposed to examine the subject with the gravity which it\r\n     certainly merits, most anxiously desire to be redeemed.\r\n\r\n     Notwithstanding, however, the lessons which experience has taught\r\n     in this respect, it is likely that Illinois will be agitated by\r\n     the exertions of unreflecting men, and possibly without timely\r\n     and energetic efforts to counteract their schemes, they may be\r\n     enabled to persuade a majority of her people to violate their\r\n     early vows on this subject, and pollute your soil with the blood\r\n     and tears of slaves.\r\n\r\n     Feeling as I do, a deep sympathy for thyself, thus threatened\r\n     with the most unhappy consequences, and desirous that miseries\r\n     and mischiefs, the amount of which no mind can fully calculate,\r\n     may be averted from the extensive and fair region of which\r\n     Illinois forms a part, I would willingly contribute anything in\r\n     my power, and with these views I offer my own, and the services\r\n     of a few of my friends, in this interesting cause.\r\n\r\n     We have thought that benefit might result from making judicious\r\n     selections from writers whose purpose is to show the iniquity,\r\n     and impolicy of slavery--these selections to be printed in the\r\n     _Tract form_ (at our own expense) and forwarded to Illinois for\r\n     gratuitous distribution. If this plan should meet thy\r\n     approbation, I should be glad to receive an early intimation to\r\n     that effect, but should thy official station, or duties, render\r\n     it either improper or inconvenient for thee to take an active\r\n     part in this business, perhaps it will be in thy power to select\r\n     a few individuals who may be disposed to aid us, and in that\r\n     event, I shall be obliged by thy introduction of such persons to\r\n     my correspondence.\r\n\r\n     Accept the salutation of my respect,\r\n                                        ROBERTS VAUX.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    EDWARDSVILLE, ILLINOIS, June 27, 1823.\r\n\r\n     _Esteemed Friend_:\r\n\r\n     Your kind and highly interesting letter of the 27th ult. was\r\n     rec'd by the last mail, and has been perused with very great\r\n     pleasure. The benevolent sentiments you express, and the correct\r\n     views you take of the great question which is now unfortunately\r\n     agitating this State, and the deep interest you evince for the\r\n     prosperity and happiness of Illinois, and the preservation of the\r\n     rights and liberty of its inhabitants, do credit alike to the\r\n     native benevolence of your heart and to those divine and\r\n     political principles which distinguish the real Christian and\r\n     Republican, and cannot fail to present a contrast, which, however\r\n     mortifying it may be to me as an Illinoisan, cannot but be highly\r\n     gratifying to me as a man, to see one so far removed from the\r\n     scene, and without any other interest except that which he feels\r\n     in the general happiness of his species, nobly and generously\r\n     volunteering his services to assist in promoting the cause of\r\n     humanity, whilst there are thousands here strenuously advocating\r\n     the giving a legal sanction to the oppression and abject slavery\r\n     of their fellow-creatures. Such noble, generous, and fervid\r\n     benevolence as yours, is highly honorable even to a _Friend_; and\r\n     is a new and striking proof of that extended philanthropy, and\r\n     pure and heaven-born spirit of Brotherly love, by which that\r\n     denomination of Christians have ever been distinguished, and\r\n     cannot fail to excite the admiration and win the confidence and\r\n     attachment of all--especially of those like myself, who daily\r\n     experience pain and mortification in hearing doctrines advanced\r\n     which are directly in opposition to the great fundamental truths\r\n     of our religious and political creeds.\r\n\r\n     In behalf of the friends of freedom in this State, I give you\r\n     sincere and grateful thanks for the offer of your services to\r\n     assist us to enlighten the minds of our fellow citizens, by\r\n     publishing judicious selections and observations on the iniquity\r\n     and impolicy of Slavery, in _tract form_, and distributing them\r\n     gratuitously through the State. It may be proper, however, to\r\n     remark that distant friends should be cautious in the manner of\r\n     making their benevolent exertions, as there is danger that\r\n     designing partisans here may not only paralyze the effort, but\r\n     turn it against the cause it was intended to promote, by\r\n     representing it to be the interference of other States for the\r\n     purpose of influencing the opinion of the people of this. An\r\n     ingenious pen could dress up this subject in a manner to give it\r\n     great effect in this country. Would it not, therefore, be best\r\n     not to state on the face of the publications where they were\r\n     printed? They could be printed in Philadelphia, and sent with the\r\n     goods of some merchant of St. Louis at a much less expense than\r\n     by mail.\r\n\r\n     Not being aware of any consideration which should restrain me,\r\n     but on the contrary believing that my present office increases\r\n     the obligations I am under, as a good citizen, to exert myself to\r\n     enlighten the minds of my fellow citizens, and strenuously to\r\n     oppose every measure which I am convinced is unjust in principle\r\n     or injurious in its effects, and believing Slavery to be both\r\n     iniquitous and impolitic, I conceive myself bound, both as a\r\n     citizen and as an officer, to do all in my power to prevent its\r\n     introduction into this State. I will therefore cheerfully render\r\n     you assistance in distributing any publications you may forward,\r\n     or give you any information you may desire.\r\n\r\n     The friends of freedom here propose making publication similar to\r\n     those you suggest, but they will not have the same means of doing\r\n     justice to the subject that you will have in Philadelphia. We are\r\n     particularly anxious, not only to present to the people proper\r\n     views of the immoral and anti-christian, unjust and\r\n     anti-republican character of Slavery, but also _facts_ showing\r\n     its impolicy and injurious effects in retarding the settlement\r\n     and prosperity of the State, by checking emigration to it, and\r\n     paralyzing the enterprise and activity of its citizens--that it\r\n     would impede the progress of manufactures, be prejudicial to\r\n     agriculture, and in one word, to the future prosperity, as well\r\n     as to the immediate interest of the State. The great argument\r\n     here in favor of the introduction and toleration of Slavery, is\r\n     that it would have the immediate effect of raising the price of\r\n     lands, and adding to the population and wealth of the country. We\r\n     want _facts_ to disprove these assertions, and also to show that\r\n     Slavery would operate to the injury of the poor or laboring\r\n     classes of society. Strange as it may appear, it is nevertheless\r\n     true, that there are many persons who are in principle opposed to\r\n     Slavery who will yet vote for making this a slaveholding State,\r\n     under the belief that by so doing they will be enabled to make an\r\n     immediate and advantageous sale of their lands, and thus gratify\r\n     that restless and rambling disposition which is so common with\r\n     frontier settlers.\r\n\r\n     Pardon this long and hasty letter. Give my regards to our mutual\r\n     friend Biddle, and be assured that your generous benevolence has\r\n     inspired me with great respect and sincere regard for you.\r\n\r\n                                   EDWARD COLES.\r\n\r\n     ROBERTS VAUX,\r\n       Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       ROBERTS VAUX TO GOVERNOR COLES\r\n\r\n               BIRWOOD LODGE (NEAR PHIL'A), 7 Mo. 24, 1823.\r\n\r\n     _Esteemed Friend:_--I cannot delay an immediate acknowledgment of\r\n     thy letter of the 27th ultimo, which reached me at my summer\r\n     residence today.\r\n\r\n     It affords me unfeigned satisfaction to learn from it that thee\r\n     approves the plan which I submitted for thy consideration.\r\n     Anticipating a favorable notice of the suggestion, by a mind so\r\n     devoted as thine to the promotion of the great ends of humanity,\r\n     of justice, and of National honor, three pamphlets were prepared,\r\n     which will be immediately printed, and transmitted to thy address\r\n     at St. Louis. One of these tracts is designed to show the\r\n     impolicy and unprofitableness of Slave Labor, etc., and some\r\n     arguments are drawn from the published opinions of several\r\n     distinguished citizens _of the slave-holding States_; among which\r\n     Col. Taylor's are not the least authoritative and cogent. Another\r\n     essay exhibits a succinct account of the cruelties of the Slave\r\n     Trade, derived from authentic sources; and a third pamphlet is\r\n     intended to show that the interminable bondage of any portion of\r\n     the human race is, on the part of the oppressors, a flagrant\r\n     violation of natural and Divine Justice, and utterly inconsistent\r\n     with the doctrines of our Holy Redeemer.\r\n\r\n     Aware of the unpopularity of Philadelphia, and especially of\r\n     _Quaker_ sentiments on this particular topic, with all those who\r\n     attempt to justify slavery, it was originally determined to avoid\r\n     giving any complexion whatever to these publications which might\r\n     induce the belief that they proceeded from this State, or that\r\n     individuals of the Society of Friends had any agency in the\r\n     preparation of them. The coincidence of our judgment in regard to\r\n     the manner of treating the subject is worthy of remark.\r\n\r\n     If the least benefit results from this humble effort, it will\r\n     administer to my happiness, which will be augmented by the\r\n     reflection, that it owes its origin to thy own emphatic summons\r\n     for aid, in a cause which demands the exercise of every generous\r\n     and patriotic feeling.\r\n\r\n     That indulgent Heaven may crown thy labors with success, is the\r\n     sincere desire of thy friend.\r\n\r\n                         With great truth and respect,\r\n                                        ROBERTS VAUX.\r\n\r\n     To EDWARD COLES, ESQUIRE,\r\n       Governor of Illinois,\r\n         Edwardsville, Illinois.\r\n\r\n     P. S.--On my next visit to the city, I intend to communicate thy\r\n     message to our friend Nicholas Biddle.\r\n\r\n                                        R. V.\r\n\r\n\r\n               GOVERNOR COLES TO MR. BIDDLE\r\n\r\n                                   EDWARDSVILLE, Sept. 18, 1823.\r\n\r\n     _Dear Sir_:--I have been long anxious to return you my thanks for\r\n     your kind letter of May 20th and 26th, and also for the\r\n     acceptable service you rendered me in making me known to Mr.\r\n     Vaux, from whom I have had the pleasure of receiving two letters,\r\n     and a promise of his assistance in preventing our soil from being\r\n     polluted with the foul and disgraceful stain of slavery. The\r\n     disinterested and praiseworthy zeal he evinces is as honorable to\r\n     him, as it is gratifying to me, and is well calculated not only\r\n     to give me an exalted opinion of his character, but to awaken the\r\n     most lively feelings of regard and friendship for him. I wish,\r\n     when you see him, you would tender him my kind regards and thanks\r\n     for his letter of July 24, and say to him, I hope soon to receive\r\n     the packages promised. The propriety of calling a convention, or\r\n     more properly speaking, of making this a slave-holding State, is\r\n     still discussed with considerable warmth, and continues to engage\r\n     the undivided attention of the people, being the constant theme\r\n     of conversation in every circle, and every newspaper teems with\r\n     no other subject. Unfortunately for the friends of freedom, four\r\n     out of five of the newspapers printed in this State are opposed\r\n     to them; and the only press whose editor is in favor of freedom,\r\n     although a pretty smart editor, has rendered himself unpopular\r\n     with many by his foolish and passionate attacks upon many of the\r\n     prominent men on his side of the question. If, however, the\r\n     advocates of Slavery have the advantage of us in printing\r\n     presses, we have greatly the advantage of them in possessing men\r\n     of the most talents, and most able to wield the pen and use the\r\n     press, with effect; and as three out of four of their presses\r\n     have professed a willingness to admit well-written original\r\n     essays on both sides of the question, we shall have not only the\r\n     best of the argument, but be able, I trust, to present it in the\r\n     best dress to the public. I am happy in telling you that the\r\n     advocates of a convention have been losing ground ever since the\r\n     adjournment of the Legislature; and there is no doubt with me if\r\n     the question were now to be decided, that a majority of the\r\n     people would be opposed to it. But what will be the state of the\r\n     parties next August is another question. Many of the people in\r\n     this State are very fickle and credulous, and much can be done by\r\n     designing and unprincipled partisans, and that everything which\r\n     can possibly be done will be done, we cannot but infer from the\r\n     extraordinary and unwarrantable measures resorted to last winter\r\n     in the Legislature in getting up the question, and the great\r\n     anxiety evinced, and exertions which have been made and are still\r\n     making to prevail on the people to sanction it. But as the\r\n     friends of freedom are aware of this, they will watch the\r\n     movements of their opponents, and be on the alert to counteract\r\n     their intrigues and machinations. The object for which a\r\n     convention is wanted is so justly odious, and the conduct of the\r\n     friends of the measure so disgraceful, that I cannot bring myself\r\n     to believe they will succeed. But I regret to state that the\r\n     advocates of Slavery in this State are gaining strength, from the\r\n     indiscretion of the advocates of freedom out of the State.\r\n     Certain leading newspapers in the Atlantic cities have taken a\r\n     stand, and held language which is used here in a way calculated\r\n     to do much mischief. Whether we have the constitutional right to\r\n     make this a slave-holding State, or not, or whether the opponents\r\n     of the extension of Slavery, here or elsewhere, may think proper\r\n     hereafter to call for the interposition of the Federal Gov't to\r\n     restrain the people of this State, it is certainly bad policy at\r\n     this time very strongly to urge it, and especially in what may be\r\n     considered dictatorial language; as it is of all other questions\r\n     the best calculated to arouse the feelings of State pride, and\r\n     State rights, and that natural love of unrestrained liberty and\r\n     independence which is common to our countrymen, and especially to\r\n     our frontier settlers, who of all men in the world have the\r\n     strongest jealousy of authority and aversion to restraint.\r\n\r\n     I wish, my friend, you would use your influence to prevail on the\r\n     newspaper writers to let this question alone for the present. If\r\n     they are sincere in their opposition to the further extension of\r\n     Slavery, they will not prematurely urge it, when they are assured\r\n     that by so doing they can do no good, but much harm.\r\n\r\n     I shall go to St. Louis in a day or two, when I hope to have the\r\n     pleasure of seeing and congratulating your brother on his late\r\n     marriage, and becoming acquainted with his lady. This has been\r\n     the most cool and agreeable, and by far the most healthful summer\r\n     I have ever seen in this country. The spring was too wet and we\r\n     were apprehensive of an unfavorable season both for health and\r\n     vegetation, but we have been most agreeably disappointed. My\r\n     health was never better. I beg you to present my kind regards to\r\n     Mrs. B., and to Mr. Craig, and to be assured of my sincere\r\n     regard.\r\n\r\n                                   EDWARD COLES.\r\n\r\n     NICHOLAS BIDDLE, ESQ.,\r\n         President of the Bank of the U. S.--Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n     P. S.--Could you or Mr. Vaux furnish me with an assessment of\r\n     lands in the different counties of Pennsylvania? I want to show\r\n     that lands are higher in price in free than slave States.\r\n\r\n\r\n               GOVERNOR COLES TO ROBERTS VAUX\r\n\r\n                              VANDALIA, ILLINOIS, December 11, 1823.\r\n\r\n     _Esteemed Friend_:--I received some time since your letter of the\r\n     11th of Oct., and by the last mail yours of the 4th ulto. An\r\n     unusual press of public business prevented my sooner\r\n     acknowledging the former, and will now prevent my making as long\r\n     an answer to the two as I desire. For the last four weeks there\r\n     has been a great crowd of persons here, attending the Circuit and\r\n     Supreme Court of the State, and the U. S. and District Court and\r\n     the sale at auction for taxes of about 7,000 tracts of land,\r\n     belonging to non-resident proprietors. This has necessarily given\r\n     me much to do; but it has at the same time afforded me an\r\n     excellent opportunity of collecting the sense of the people on\r\n     the great question which is now agitating the State. And I am\r\n     happy in assuring you, from the best information I have been able\r\n     to collect from all parts of the State, I am more confirmed in my\r\n     belief that a majority of the people will be opposed to calling a\r\n     convention for the purpose of altering the Constitution so as to\r\n     make this a slave-holding State. But the extraordinary efforts\r\n     that have been made here during the last three or four weeks by\r\n     the friends of Slavery, in organizing their party, and enabling\r\n     its leaders to act with the most concert and effect, convince the\r\n     friends of freedom that their opponents are yet in the field, and\r\n     that they should be on the alert, for fear by some _ruse de\r\n     guerre_, at which their opponents are known from sad experience\r\n     to be great adepts, the advocates of oppression should triumph.\r\n     Nearly all the leading friends of a convention have been\r\n     assembled here, and held caucuses for the purpose of deliberating\r\n     upon the best means of promoting the success of their favorite\r\n     measure; have adopted sundry resolutions, and made many\r\n     arrangements; among others have appointed committees for each\r\n     county in the State, and requested that the county committees\r\n     appoint a committee in each township, for the purpose of\r\n     corresponding with each other, and of influencing by every\r\n     possible means the public opinion.\r\n\r\n     With respect to your inquiry whether there is not some more\r\n     expeditious and safe mode of sending out the pamphlets than\r\n     through a commercial house at St. Louis, I can think of no other,\r\n     except to forward them, as pamphlets, by mail to me to this\r\n     place, which is at this season of the year slow and precarious.\r\n\r\n     The pamphlet you forwarded me by mail, along with your last\r\n     letter, I received safe; but have been so busy as not yet to have\r\n     had time to read it. Two thousand of each kind, will, I presume,\r\n     be enough, and as many as I shall be able conveniently to\r\n     distribute. There will be for the next six months, so few persons\r\n     visiting this place, that I shall be compelled to rely chiefly on\r\n     the mails, as the means of distributing pamphlets, or other\r\n     information to the public. If possible, I intend to have all the\r\n     pamphlets published in one or more of our weekly newspapers.\r\n\r\n     Accompanying this I send you a pamphlet, which has been lately\r\n     published by my old friend Birkbeck, which is by far the best\r\n     publication which has been yet given to the public. After you\r\n     have perused it, you will confer a favor on me to loan it for the\r\n     perusal of our mutual friend Biddle, to whom I beg you to present\r\n     my kind regards.\r\n\r\n     With great respect and sincere regards, your friend,\r\n\r\n                                   EDWARD COLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n     TO ROBERTS VAUX,\r\n          Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n     We have had the misfortune (two days since) to lose our State\r\n     House by fire. This accident will operate in favor of a\r\n     convention. Many profess to be opposed to slavery but in favor of\r\n     a convention to remove the seat of Government. There is now of\r\n     course less inducement for keeping it here. I still, however,\r\n     hope and believe we shall have no convention.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         MORRIS BIRKBECK TO GOVERNOR COLES\r\n\r\n\r\n                                             WANBOROUGH, Dec. 6, 1823.\r\n\r\n     _Dear Sir_: * * * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\n     I take the liberty by this mail to send you half a dozen; and if,\r\n     on reading a copy, you should think it may be useful to any of\r\n     the unconverted Conventionists, you may put it in their way. I am\r\n     glad you think favorably of the course the question is taking. I\r\n     believe the advocates of a Convention are not so numerous as they\r\n     have been on this side of the State. The leaders do not seem to\r\n     be so sanguine. This may, however, be a _ruse de guerre_\r\n     preparatory to a grand push in the spring. I am rejoiced that you\r\n     have escaped from sickness this summer. My family has enjoyed\r\n     excellent health, and the neighborhood--as heretofore. We should\r\n     be glad to see you amongst us; and a friendly visit from you\r\n     would give _me_ peculiar pleasure. I have not seen Mr. Pell since\r\n     the morning, when I received your letter. I shall deliver your\r\n     message to him, and I beg you to believe me your sincere friend,\r\n\r\n                         M. BIRKBECK.\r\n     TO GOVERNOR COLES,\r\n       Vandalia.\r\n\r\n\r\n               GOVERNOR COLES TO MORRIS BIRKBECK\r\n\r\n                                   VANDALIA, January 29, 1824.\r\n\r\n     _My Dear Sir_:--I had the pleasure to receive, in due course of\r\n     mail, your letter of the 6th ulto., together with six of your\r\n     pamphlets, which you were so good as to send me, for which I\r\n     return you my thanks. I had previously seen republished in a\r\n     newspaper your pamphlet, and had read it with great pleasure. I\r\n     could not but wish every Conventionist in the State had it and\r\n     was compelled to read it with attention. Our society at\r\n     Edwardsville intends having another and large edition of it\r\n     reprinted for the purpose of having it extensively circulated. I\r\n     took the liberty to send one or two of your pamphlets to some\r\n     distant and particular friends, who take a deep interest in the\r\n     Slave question in this State. By the by, should not the review of\r\n     your pamphlet, which appeared first in the Illinois Gazette, and\r\n     since republished in all the Convention papers of the State, be\r\n     noticed? It is very ingeniously written, but what more\r\n     particularly requires correction is the fabrications and\r\n     misrepresentations of facts. One or two of these were hastily\r\n     noticed and sent to be inserted last week in the paper published\r\n     here; but no paper has since issued from the press.\r\n\r\n     During the setting of the Courts, and the sale of the lands of\r\n     non-residents for taxes, we had a considerable number of persons\r\n     assembled here from almost every part of the State; and a pretty\r\n     good opportunity was afforded of collecting the public sentiment\r\n     in relation to the great question which is now convulsing the\r\n     State. The friends of a Convention pretended to be pleased; but\r\n     it was very apparent they were not; and the more honest and\r\n     liberal among them acknowledged that they thought their prospects\r\n     bad. Our friends on the other hand were much pleased, and\r\n     rendered much more sanguine of success from the information they\r\n     received. The friends of Slavery, however, were caucusing nearly\r\n     every night, and made many arrangements for their electioneering\r\n     campaign. Among others, it is said, they have appointed five\r\n     persons in each county, with a request that these five appoint\r\n     three in each election precinct, for the purpose of diffusing\r\n     their doctrines, embodying their forces, and acting with the\r\n     greatest concert and effort. This is well calculated to bring\r\n     their strength to bear in the best possible manner, and should,\r\n     as far as possible, be counteracted. When bad men conspire, good\r\n     men should be watchful.\r\n\r\n     The friends of a Convention appear to become more and more bitter\r\n     and virulent in their enmity to me, and seem determined not only\r\n     to injure my standing with the people, but to break down my\r\n     pecuniary resources. A suit has been lately instituted at\r\n     Edwardsville against me for the recovery of the sum of $200 for\r\n     _each_ negro emancipated by me and brought into this State. The\r\n     suit has been brought under a law passed on the 30th of March,\r\n     1819, but which was not printed or promulgated until the October\r\n     following. In the meantime, that is about the first week of May,\r\n     my negroes emigrated to and settled in this State. What is truly\r\n     farcical in this suit is, that a poor worthless fellow, who has\r\n     no property, and of course pays no tax, has been selected to\r\n     institute it, from the fear he has of being taxed to support the\r\n     negroes I emancipated, when they, who are all young and healthy,\r\n     are so prosperous as to possess comfortable livings, and some of\r\n     them pay as much as four dollars a year tax on their property. I\r\n     should indeed, my friend, be unfortunate were I now compelled to\r\n     pay $200 for each of my negroes, big and little, dead and living\r\n     (for the suit goes to this) after the sacrifices I have made, and\r\n     my efforts to befriend and enable them to live comfortably. For I\r\n     not only emancipated all my negroes, which amounted to one-third\r\n     of all the property my father bequeathed me, but I removed them\r\n     out here at an expense of between five and six hundred dollars,\r\n     and then gave each head of a family, and all others who had\r\n     passed the age of 24, one hundred and sixty acres of land each,\r\n     and exerted myself to prevail on them to be honest, industrious\r\n     and correct in their conduct. This they have done in a remarkable\r\n     degree, so much so, with all the prejudice against free negroes,\r\n     there never has been the least ground for charge or censure\r\n     against any one of them. And now, for the first time in my life,\r\n     to be sued for what I thought was generous and praiseworthy\r\n     conduct, creates strange feelings, which, however, cease to give\r\n     me personal mortification, when I reflect on the character and\r\n     motives of those who have instituted it.\r\n\r\n     Just about the time this suit was instituted, I had the\r\n     misfortune to lose by fire two-thirds of all the buildings and\r\n     enclosures on my farm, together with about 200 apple trees and as\r\n     many peach trees--several of each kind large enough to bear\r\n     fruit. And soon after, the \"State House\" having been consumed by\r\n     fire, a project was set on foot to rebuild it by subscription.\r\n     Not liking the plan and arrangements, I declined subscribing, and\r\n     proposed others, which I thought would be more for the interest\r\n     of the State, of the county, and of the town--and which by the\r\n     way are now generally admitted would have been best. This however\r\n     was immediately laid hold of by some of the factious\r\n     Conventionists who being aware that the loss of the State House\r\n     would operate to the injury of their favorite measure in _this\r\n     county_, and being anxious to display great solicitude for the\r\n     interest of the people here, and that too, as much as possible at\r\n     the expense of the anti-Conventionists, they busied themselves in\r\n     misrepresenting to the multitude my reasons and motives for not\r\n     subscribing my name to their paper, and with the aid of large\r\n     potions of whiskey, contrived to get up a real _vandal_ mob, who\r\n     vented their spleen against me, in the most noisy and riotous\r\n     manner, nearly all night, for my opposition to a convention and\r\n     for my refusal as they termed it, to rebuild the State House. All\r\n     this and other instances of defamation and persecution, create in\r\n     my bosom opposite feelings; one of pain, the other of pleasure.\r\n     Pain to see my fellow man so ill-natured and vindictive merely\r\n     because I am the friend of my species, and am opposed to one\r\n     portion oppressing another--pleasure that I should be in a\r\n     situation which enables me to render services to the just and\r\n     good cause in which we are engaged; and so far from repining at\r\n     these indignities and persecutions, I am thankful to Providence\r\n     for placing me in the van of this eventful contest, and giving me\r\n     a temper, zeal, and resolution which I trust will enable me to\r\n     bear with fortitude the peltings which are inseparable from it.\r\n     In conclusion, I pray you to do me the justice to believe, that\r\n     no dread of personal consequences will ever abate my efforts to\r\n     promote the good of the public, much less to abandon the great\r\n     fundamental principles of civil and personal liberty--and to be\r\n     assured of my sincere friendship.\r\n\r\n                                   EDWARD COLES.\r\n\r\n     MORRIS BIRKBECK, ESQ.,\r\n       Wanborough, Edwards County.\r\n\r\n\r\n               MR. BIRKBECK TO GOVERNOR COLES\r\n\r\n                                   WANBOROUGH, Feb. 19, 1824.\r\n\r\n     _My Dear Sir_:--I have just received your letter of January 29,\r\n     and I assure you the receiving of it has given me unfeigned\r\n     pleasure, although its contents, as far as the unworthy conduct\r\n     of the party is productive of vexation to you, I as sincerely\r\n     lament. I am sorry that it should be at your expense; but as it\r\n     tends to expose the badness of the cause and the iniquity of its\r\n     supporters, the friends of liberty and virtue can hardly regret\r\n     that they should have thus displayed their true characters.\r\n\r\n     For myself, my private situation screens me in great measure from\r\n     persecution, though I presume, not from the honor of their\r\n     hatred. I am glad, you approve my little pamphlet; if I could\r\n     afford it I would spare the society at Edwardsville the expense\r\n     of republishing, &c. I have the satisfaction of knowing that it\r\n     has done some good, by changing the sentiments of several, who\r\n     through want of reflection or knowledge, had been advocates of\r\n     Slavery. And as there are many up and down in all parts of the\r\n     State, who are in that situation, I trust its general circulation\r\n     will be useful. I am continually plying the Slave party, through\r\n     the Illinois Gazette, with popular discussions and sometimes with\r\n     legal arguments, under the signature of Jonathan Freeman, and\r\n     some others. You will see, if you read that paper, an ironical\r\n     proposal of a plan for raising a fund to colonize the negroes as\r\n     an appendage to limited Slavery, signed J., which I think may\r\n     show the absurdity of that argument. The Edwardsville Spectator\r\n     published about a dozen of those short letters, and I suppose\r\n     that you will see a few more of them shortly. As they present\r\n     the question in various lights, pointing out the wickedness and\r\n     folly of the slave scheme, dissected as it were into distinct\r\n     portions, I imagine they make an impression on some readers more\r\n     effectually than a continued course of argument. I submit, with\r\n     great deference, a thought that some of these would be useful if\r\n     published by way of appendix to the _Appeal_. Perhaps you will\r\n     revert to them, and notice a few more which you will soon see;\r\n     then do as you see good.\r\n\r\n     As _publication_ is essential to the binding power of a law, in\r\n     fact to its existence _as law_, you will of course defeat your\r\n     persecutors, and put them to shame, on the principle of _ex post\r\n     facto_. You could not infringe in May a law promulgated in\r\n     October following.\r\n\r\n     The fire at Vandalia is rather against the Conventionists in that\r\n     quarter. The idea of re-building the State House by subscription,\r\n     you, as governor, could hardly countenance. What authority have\r\n     individuals to act in this case, even at their own expense? And\r\n     what claim have they on your private purse? I am only sorry for\r\n     your personal vexation under these attacks. They discover the\r\n     weakness and folly of the party, and I am in hopes they are\r\n     losing ground. They have great zeal and activity and no delicacy\r\n     about the means; there is considerable zeal and activity on our\r\n     side; and setting the good principles of our cause against their\r\n     total want of principle, I trust we are a match for them,\r\n     provided we do not relax in our efforts. The attack on my\r\n     pamphlet by Americanus (who is Mr. Webb of Bonpas), seems to the\r\n     Illinois Gazette a short reply to the personalities; further I\r\n     thought needless, and have just written another to the same\r\n     effect, which I shall send to the Vandalia paper. Not being\r\n     presumed to know the author, some severity of retort seems\r\n     allowable.\r\n\r\n     You have a circle at Vandalia chiefly, I fear, of the wrong sort\r\n     in regard to the vital question, which circumstance must detract\r\n     from your social enjoyment, where at best it could ill be spared.\r\n     The cause in which you are engaged so heartily is so thoroughly\r\n     good that it will bear you up through many sacrifices and\r\n     privations. Your sentiments on the subject rejoice and encourage\r\n     me, and in return (pedantry as it may seem) I shall give you a\r\n     sentiment from Horace for _your_ encouragement.[233]\r\n\r\n         Justum et tenacem propositi virum,\r\n         Non civium ardor prava jubentium,\r\n         Non vultus instantis tyranni,\r\n         Mente quatit solida.\r\n\r\n     I remain, with great esteem, yours,\r\n                                        M. BIRKBECK.\r\n\r\n\r\n     MORRIS BIRKBECK, ESQ.,\r\n         Wanborough.\r\n\r\n     I had hoped after the great and decided majority which was given\r\n     at the late election against a Convention, my political enemies\r\n     would have ceased to persecute me. But in this I was mistaken. It\r\n     would seem I must be sacrificed. Nothing short of my entire ruin\r\n     will satisfy my enemies, and they seem determined to effect it\r\n     without regard to the means. Yesterday the suit which has been\r\n     instituted against me for freeing my negroes was called up for\r\n     trial. Judge Reynolds not only decided several points of law\r\n     against me, in opposition to the opinion of several of the best\r\n     lawyers in the State, but he and Mr. Turney rejected _all_ my\r\n     testimony as illegal, and would not permit a solitary word to be\r\n     uttered by a witness of mine. Under such circumstances the jury\r\n     found a verdict of $2,000 against me, which, with the cost, will\r\n     be a difficult sum for me to raise, these hard times. I shall ask\r\n     for a new trial. If this application should share the fate of all\r\n     others I have made, it is to be hoped he will not assume the\r\n     power to prevent my taking an appeal to the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\n     In haste, your friend,\r\n                                   ED. COLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n               GOVERNOR COLES TO ROBERTS VAUX\r\n\r\n                                   VANDALIA, Jan'y 21, 1824.\r\n\r\n     _My Friend_:--While at Edwardsville a few days since, I received\r\n     a letter from D. B. Smith, notifying me that he had forwarded to\r\n     the care of I. I. Smith & Co., of St. Louis, certain pamphlets;\r\n     previous to which, however, I had been informed by one of that\r\n     company that he expected them, and had requested him to notify me\r\n     so soon as they should be received, and to forward them to me to\r\n     this place by the first safe opportunity. I also had the pleasure\r\n     to receive at Edwardsville the pamphlet you were so good as to\r\n     enclose me by mail. The information contained in this pamphlet in\r\n     relation to the foreign slave trade, is highly interesting. I\r\n     must, however, be allowed to express my regret that it does not\r\n     bear more directly on the question, which is now agitating us\r\n     here, by showing the resemblance between the _foreign_ and\r\n     _domestic_ slave trade, and the inevitable effect of the\r\n     extension of Slavery into new regions, to continue and increase\r\n     this odious traffic. To add to the circulation of this, as well\r\n     as the pamphlet I had previously the pleasure to receive from\r\n     you, I shall, if possible, prevail on some of the editors to\r\n     publish them in their newspapers. But unfortunately for our\r\n     cause, of the five newspapers printed in this State, four are the\r\n     avowed advocates of Slavery (in other words for a Convention) and\r\n     but one of Freedom, and that one not friendly to me and other\r\n     opponents of the Convention. This division among us arises from\r\n     factions, personal and local feelings, and from the circumstance\r\n     that we have many avowed friends of freedom, who are themselves\r\n     the masters of slaves; and who, while they unite with us in\r\n     opposing the means of the further introduction of Slavery, are at\r\n     the same time violently opposed to our efforts to abolish the\r\n     remnant of Slavery which is still allowed to stain our soil.\r\n     There is also another class among us who profess to be opposed to\r\n     Slavery and who rail much against it, but yet who are friendly to\r\n     it, as is fully evinced by their advocating every measure\r\n     calculated to introduce and tolerate it here. The character and\r\n     feelings of these several classes of our citizens were strongly\r\n     exemplified last winter, when, on entering into office, I called\r\n     the attention of the Legislature to the existence of Slavery\r\n     among us, and urged its abolition. As it may be the means of\r\n     throwing some light on the slave question in this State, I will\r\n     send you, accompanying this letter, a printed copy of my speech,\r\n     and a report made by a committee of the Legislature on a part of\r\n     it.\r\n\r\n     My remarks and recommendation on the subject of Slavery produced\r\n     a great excitement among those who held slaves, or were desirous\r\n     of holding them, particularly among those advocates of a\r\n     Convention who were professedly the opponents of Slavery, but\r\n     secretly its friends, and who hoped under the fair mask of\r\n     freedom, to deceive the people and to smuggle in the monster\r\n     Slavery. Bringing forward the measure of abolition at the same\r\n     time they brought forward the Convention question, placed these\r\n     professed friends to the rights of man in an awkward situation,\r\n     for it was apparent if they voted agreeable to their\r\n     declarations, they, together with the real and genuine friends of\r\n     freedom, would constitute a majority of the Legislature, and of\r\n     course pass the abolition Bill. This state of things had the\r\n     effect of unmasking their true opinions and views, and of clearly\r\n     exhibiting to the public the real object for which a convention\r\n     was to be called--that of making this a Slave-holding State....\r\n\r\n     Having had the good fortune, through every period of my life, to\r\n     live in great harmony with my fellow man, the enmity and\r\n     persecution I have lately had to encounter, have created a new\r\n     state of feeling, and caused me to look into my own conduct to\r\n     see whether it has been correct. In this review I have been\r\n     gratified to find I have not given just cause of offense to any\r\n     one; but I have been grieved to perceive with what virulence I\r\n     have been pelted, when the only complaint against me is, that I\r\n     am a friend to the equal rights of man, and am considered a\r\n     barrier to my opponents acquiring the power of oppressing their\r\n     fellow man. Under this view of my situation, I am gratified that\r\n     Providence has placed me in the van of this great contest; and I\r\n     am truly thankful that my system is so organized as to leave no\r\n     room for doubt, fear or hesitation. My opinions have long since\r\n     been maturely formed, and my course deliberately taken, and is\r\n     not now to be changed by detraction, prosecutions, or threats of\r\n     \"_Convention or death_.\"\r\n\r\n     I beg you excuse my troubling you with the perusal of so long a\r\n     letter, and that you will pardon me for having said so much of\r\n     myself, in consideration of its connection with the great\r\n     question now agitating this State, by interesting yourself in\r\n     which you have displayed so signal and praiseworthy an instance\r\n     of your benevolence--for which I pray you to accept the grateful\r\n     thanks of your friend,\r\n\r\n                                   EDWARD COLES.\r\n\r\nAnswering this January 21, 1824, Mr. Vaux said:\r\n\r\n     The part which thee has been called to act, privately as well as\r\n     publicly and officially, in regard to the rights of mankind, and\r\n     for the upholding of the principles of justice and mercy toward a\r\n     degraded and oppressed portion of our fellow beings, ought to be\r\n     regarded as a manifestation of Providential power, concerning\r\n     which we must always believe the same Divine interposition will\r\n     be extended in every exigency. I am altogether satisfied that it\r\n     is reserved for thee to witness the triumph of truth and\r\n     beneficence in the struggle to which thee has been exposed; and,\r\n     what is of infinitely greater value, as it respects thyself, to\r\n     reap a plentiful harvest in the most precious of all rewards, the\r\n     approbation of Heaven!\r\n\r\n     I feel a deep interest in thy character, and a lively gratitude\r\n     for thy service, and it will always be among the purest\r\n     consolations of my mind to be assured of thy welfare and\r\n     happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n               ROBERTS VAUX TO GOVERNOR COLES\r\n\r\n     _Esteemed Friend_:--My delay in the acknowledgment of the receipt\r\n     of thy truly interesting letter of Jan'y 21, last, will not, I\r\n     trust, be attributed to any want of respect and kindness, but to\r\n     the real causes, which were, first, an unusual press of business\r\n     relative to several public institutions, which at the season of\r\n     the receipt of that communication demanded my attention; and\r\n     secondly, to the expectation subsequently entertained here, that\r\n     thy presence might be expected at Washington as successor in the\r\n     Senate of the United States to N. Edwards, appointed on a foreign\r\n     mission. The likelihood that the latter event might bring us to a\r\n     _personal_ acquaintance in this city, when the session of\r\n     Congress should terminate, was contemplated with pleasure, since\r\n     a direct interchange of opinion would be preferred to epistolary\r\n     correspondence. Time, however, has served to show that this\r\n     prospect, with many others upon which we dwell with satisfaction,\r\n     failed of realization, and I therefore avail myself of the only\r\n     means which are left to renew the assurance of my remembrance, of\r\n     my undissembled regard, and of my sincere sympathy. The part\r\n     which thee has been called to act privately as well as publicly,\r\n     and officially, in regard to the rights of mankind, and for the\r\n     upholding of the principles of justice, and mercy toward a\r\n     degraded and oppressed portion of our fellow beings, ought to be\r\n     regarded as a manifestation of Providential power, concerning\r\n     which we must always believe the same Divine interposition will\r\n     be extended in every exigency. I am altogether satisfied that it\r\n     is reserved for thee to witness the triumph of truth and\r\n     beneficence in the struggle to which thee has been exposed; and,\r\n     what is of infinitely greater value, as it respects thyself, to\r\n     reap a plenteous harvest in the most precious of all rewards, the\r\n     approbation of Heaven!\r\n\r\n     I feel a deep interest in thy character, and a lively gratitude\r\n     for thy services, and it will always be among the purest\r\n     consolations of my mind to be assured of thy welfare and\r\n     happiness; with these impressions I salute thee, and remain\r\n     faithfully,\r\n\r\n                              Thy Friend,\r\n                                   ROBERTS VAUX\r\n\r\n     To EDWARD COLES,\r\n       Governor of Illinois.\r\n\r\n     P. S.--I yesterday passed half and hour with our friend, N.\r\n     Biddle; he is well, but very much occupied with official duties\r\n     at the bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n               ROBERTS VAUX TO GOVERNOR COLES\r\n\r\n     _Dear Friend_: The last intelligence from Philadelphia is, that\r\n     the great question which has so long agitated your State, and\r\n     which had a bearing so important upon the common interests of\r\n     humanity, and justice, has been determined. Happy for your\r\n     commonwealth! Creditable for our country! Slavery will not be\r\n     permitted to overrun Illinois! The result of the conflict is\r\n     truly joyous; you have said to the moral plague, \"_Thus far, but\r\n     no farther, shalt thou come._\"\r\n\r\n     My warmest congratulations are tendered on this great event,\r\n     though I know how inferior all exterior circumstances must be in\r\n     comparison with the heart-solacing reward which is reaped by thy\r\n     devotedness in this noble cause.\r\n\r\n     Since I have been at my summer residence, I have received several\r\n     numbers of an Illinois newspaper, and a pamphlet from the same\r\n     quarter, all which contained highly interesting matter relative\r\n     to the question then undecided in your State; I presume I am\r\n     indebted to thy kindness for those documents, for which I feel\r\n     greatly obliged. The letter of Thos. Jefferson addressed to\r\n     thyself, is very interesting, and I have it in contemplation to\r\n     cause it to be printed in a tract form, for general distribution,\r\n     provided such use of it, may be altogether agreeable to thee.\r\n\r\n     I have indulged myself with a hope that it may be within the\r\n     range of probability, that thee will make a visit to Philadelphia\r\n     ere long. Not anything would give me more pleasure than thy\r\n     presence in our city, and that gratification would be increased\r\n     by thy making my house thy home. I have much more to communicate\r\n     than I have leisure now to put on paper, as we are today\r\n     preparing to return, on the morrow, to our house in town.\r\n\r\n     With sincere regard I remain thy friend,\r\n\r\n                                   ROBERTS VAUX.\r\n\r\n\r\n               GOVERNOR COLES TO ROBERTS VAUX\r\n\r\n     _My Dear Sir_:--When I had the happiness to enjoy your society\r\n     last summer in Philadelphia, you were so kind as to express a\r\n     wish to hear from me on my return to this State. I should long\r\n     since have fulfilled the promise then made you to comply with\r\n     this request which I felt was as flattering to me, as it was kind\r\n     in you; but for a mass of business which had accumulated during\r\n     my absence, the preparation for the meeting, and the labor and\r\n     interruption attendant on the session of the Legislature, which\r\n     adjourned a few days since; and the novel and extraordinary\r\n     efforts made by some of my old political opponents to supplant me\r\n     in the office of Governor, by thrusting in my place the\r\n     Lieutenant-Governor a zealous and thorough-going advocate of\r\n     Slavery. I had heard nothing of this intention (for although many\r\n     letters were written to me, it so happened not one ever came to\r\n     hand, or has since been heard of) until I reached Louisville on\r\n     my way home, when I was told by a friend that he had been\r\n     informed by a distinguished opponent of mine that it had been\r\n     determined that I should not be permitted to resume the office of\r\n     Governor. On my arriving in the State, I found that there had\r\n     been several caucuses held in different places, by what are\r\n     called the knowing ones, for the purpose of devising the best\r\n     mode of proceeding, and of organizing their forces to act against\r\n     me. All the Executive officers of the State recognizing me as\r\n     Governor, I found no difficulty in entering at once on the duties\r\n     of the office. The Lieutenant-Governor, however, still remained\r\n     at the seat of Gov't, contending that I had vacated the office by\r\n     my absence from the State, and that he was, under the\r\n     constitution, the acting Governor. On the meeting of the Supreme\r\n     Court, he applied for a mandamus against the Secretary of State.\r\n     The court refused the mandamus on an incidental point, and got\r\n     rid of the main question without deciding it. Soon after this the\r\n     General Assembly met, and efforts were made to induce it to\r\n     recognize the Lieutenant as the acting Governor; but these\r\n     efforts having failed, he made a communication to both Houses,\r\n     setting forth his claims to the office of Governor, and asking to\r\n     be heard by himself or counsel in support of them. Nothing was\r\n     done with this communication, there being only _one_ member in\r\n     _each_ House openly in favor of the Lieutenant-Governor's\r\n     pretensions. There would doubtless have been more if there had\r\n     been any prospect of ousting me. I attribute the unexpected\r\n     unanimity to the circumstance of the question having been stirred\r\n     in time to afford the people an opportunity of making known their\r\n     opinions and feelings to their Representatives previous to their\r\n     leaving home to take their seats in the Legislature. The current\r\n     of public opinion on this question was too strong in my favor to\r\n     be resisted by any but a most desperate antagonist. This effort\r\n     of my opponents has recoiled very much to my advantage, in\r\n     weakening their popularity, and adding to the strength of mine.\r\n\r\n     You will recollect my having shown you last summer some\r\n     strictures, which I had been induced to publish on the judge's\r\n     opinion in the malicious suit which had been instituted against\r\n     me for freeing my negroes, in consequence of several\r\n     extraordinary errors of fact, as well as of law, which it\r\n     contained, and the unusual pains taken by the judge to publish\r\n     and circulate these errors to my injury. Two actions have been\r\n     instituted against me for this publication--one by the court--the\r\n     other in the name of the judge as an individual, in which he has\r\n     laid his damages at $5,000. The former is to be tried at\r\n     Edwardsville next month--the latter at this place in April. The\r\n     original suit, or mother of the judge's twin-suits, is still\r\n     pending in our Supreme Court, and is expected will be decided at\r\n     the June term. I trust I shall get rid of all of these suits in\r\n     the course of the spring and summer. I feel the more anxious to\r\n     do so as they are the first suits, that ever were instituted\r\n     against me.\r\n\r\n     I have not heard anything of the pamphlets which you were so good\r\n     as to promise to send me. I shall go to St. Louis in about a\r\n     month, when I hope to receive them. I see noticed in the public\r\n     prints a new pamphlet, published by G. and C. Carville, at New\r\n     York, on the emancipation and removal of the slaves of the U. S.\r\n     If you could conveniently lay your hands on this pamphlet, you\r\n     would confer a favor on me by sending it to me by mail. May I ask\r\n     the favor of you to hand to Mr. Fry the enclosed five dollar\r\n     note, and request him to forward the National Gazette to William\r\n     Wilson (Chief Justice of the State), Carmi, White county,\r\n     Illinois.\r\n\r\n     I beg you to present my kind regards to Mrs. Vaux, and to accept\r\n     my grateful acknowledgments for your very kind and truly friendly\r\n     attentions to me while in Philadelphia; and permit me again to\r\n     renew to you the assurance of my obligations to you for the\r\n     services rendered to humanity and to Illinois during the late\r\n     vile effort to prostitute their rights and character and to\r\n     repeat that the virtuous and benevolent interest you evinced on\r\n     that occasion will ever endear you to\r\n\r\n                                   EDWARD COLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n               GOVERNOR COLES TO A. COWLES\r\n\r\n     _Dear Sir_:--Believing that I should have been able to prove that\r\n     I had not libeled Judge McRoberts, and explain how the Grand Jury\r\n     had been induced to present me for so doing, it was with great\r\n     regret that I heard you had thought proper to dismiss the\r\n     prosecution. Fearing that some malicious person may misrepresent\r\n     this transaction at some future day, when those who now\r\n     understand it may have forgotten many of the details in relation\r\n     to it, or perhaps be dead, or have removed from the country, I\r\n     have determined to ask the favor of you to give me a written\r\n     answer to the following questions:\r\n\r\n     Did you summon or request Judge McRoberts to appear before the\r\n     Grand Jury, which presented me for libeling him?\r\n\r\n     Did not Judge McRoberts request to see the indictment before it\r\n     was delivered to the Grand Jury, and did he not examine and alter\r\n     it, and if so what were the alterations made by him?\r\n\r\n     Did you ask Mr. Blackwell to aid you in the prosecution of me,\r\n     and do you know whether he was employed by Judge McRoberts to do\r\n     so?\r\n\r\n     As you have expressed the opinion verbally to several persons,\r\n     that I had not libeled Judge McRoberts, I ask the favor of you to\r\n     give me your opinion in writing, whether the matter contained in\r\n     the indictment was a libel?\r\n\r\n     With great respect, I am &c., &c.,\r\n                                   EDWARD COLES.\r\n\r\n     A. COWLES, ESQ.,\r\n       Circuit Attorney,\r\n         Edwardsville.\r\n\r\n     P. S.--Why was not Judge McRoberts returned as a witness, on the\r\n     back of the indictment?\r\n\r\n\r\n     EXTRACT FROM A LETTER FROM GOVERNOR COLES TO JOHN\r\n     RUTHERFORD\r\n\r\n     I give you many thanks, my dear Sir, for your long and truly\r\n     affectionate letter of February, and assure you, I feel great\r\n     contrition for having so long delayed the expression of them, and\r\n     of saying how much gratified I was at perusing your kind letter,\r\n     and the glad tidings it gave me of the health and happiness of\r\n     our dear Emily and her little ones; and also the pleasure I have\r\n     since derived at finding from the newspapers in what a flattering\r\n     manner your fellow citizens have elected you to represent them in\r\n     the Legislature.\r\n\r\n     I am greatly gratified at your election, not only from the regard\r\n     I have for you as a man, etc., and the consequent interest I take\r\n     in, and the pleasure I derive from your success; but I am\r\n     particularly so in seeing men of your principles in relation to\r\n     negro Slavery in the Councils of Virginia, as it cheers me with\r\n     the hope that something will soon be done to repudiate the\r\n     unnatural connection which has there so long existed between the\r\n     freest of the free and the most slavish of slaves.\r\n\r\n     Even if it were feasible, from the extraordinary apathy in the\r\n     great mass of the people, and the zeal displayed by many to\r\n     perpetuate the evil, I could not hope for speedy emancipation,\r\n     but I do trust for the honor as well as interest of the State\r\n     that ameliorating laws will be speedily passed, which will\r\n     gradually have the effect of reconciling and habituating the\r\n     masters, and preparing the slaves for a change which, as Mr.\r\n     Jefferson says, must sooner or later take place with or without\r\n     the consent of the masters. It behooves Virginia to move in this\r\n     great question; and it is a solemn duty which her politicians owe\r\n     to their country, to themselves, and to their posterity, to look\r\n     ahead and make provision for the future, and secure the peace,\r\n     prosperity and glory of their country.\r\n\r\n     The policy of Virginia for some years past has been most\r\n     unfortunate. So far from acting as if Slavery were an evil which\r\n     ought to be gotten rid of, every measure which could be taken has\r\n     been taken to perpetuate it, as if it were a blessing. Her\r\n     political pilots have acted like the inexperienced navigator,\r\n     who, to get rid of the slight inconvenience of the safety-valves\r\n     have hermetically sealed them, not foreseeing that the inevitable\r\n     consequence will be the bursting of the boiler, and dreadful\r\n     havoc among all on board. No law has been passed under the\r\n     _commonwealth_ to ameliorate the black code of the _colony_ of\r\n     Virginia; on the contrary, new laws have been passed, adding to\r\n     the oppression of the unfortunate negroes, and which have not\r\n     only abridged the rights of humanity, but of the citizen. Such is\r\n     the character of the law which restricts and to a great degree\r\n     prohibits the master from manumitting his slave. The idea should\r\n     be ever present to the politicians of Virginia, that the state of\r\n     Slavery is an unnatural state, and cannot exist forever; it must\r\n     come to an end by consent or by force; and if by consent, it must\r\n     from all experience, as from the nature of things, be preceded by\r\n     ameliorating laws, which will have the effect of gradually and\r\n     imperceptibly loosening the bonds of servitude.\r\n\r\n     Nothing is more erroneous than the idea which is entertained by\r\n     many, that ameliorating laws, and especially manumissions, are\r\n     productions of insurrections among the slaves. The history of the\r\n     British and Spanish West Indies shows that in those Islands where\r\n     they have prevailed most, the slaves have behaved best, and\r\n     insurrections have occurred oftenest where the slaves have been\r\n     most oppressed and manumissions most restricted. Indeed, we never\r\n     hear of insurrections in the Spanish Islands, where the slaves\r\n     are most under the protection of the law, and where there are no\r\n     restrictions on manumissions. Virginia should repeal the law\r\n     against emancipation, prohibit the domestic slave-trade--which is\r\n     nearly allied in all its odious features to the African slave\r\n     trade--restrict the power of the master in disposing of his\r\n     slaves, by preventing him from separating the child from its\r\n     parent, the husband from his wife, etc., and if possible, connect\r\n     the slave under proper modifications to the soil, or at least to\r\n     the vicinity of his birth; instruct the slaves especially in the\r\n     duties of Religion; extend to them the protection of the laws,\r\n     and punish severity in the master, and when cruelly exercised by\r\n     him, it should vest the right in the slave to his freedom; or to\r\n     be sold at an assessed valuation. These and many other provisions\r\n     might be adopted which would have a most salutary effect, and\r\n     especially the Spanish provision, which gives the right to the\r\n     slave to buy a portion of his time as soon as he can procure the\r\n     means, either by his own labor or by the bounty of others; thus,\r\n     for instance, suppose a negro worth $600 on paying $100, he is\r\n     entitled to one day in each week, and so on. In connection with\r\n     the emancipation of slaves, I should provide for the removal by\r\n     bounty and otherwise, of free negroes from the country, as the\r\n     natural difference, and unfortunate prejudice existing between\r\n     the whites and blacks would make it the interest of both to be\r\n     separated. This subject, is too big for a letter, and I can only\r\n     add, that if I could see ameliorating laws adopted, if I did not\r\n     live to see the emancipation, I should at least die with the\r\n     happy consolation of believing that measures were in progress for\r\n     the consummation of ultimate justice to the descendants of the\r\n     unfortunate African; and that my country, and the descendants of\r\n     my family, if not my nephews and nieces, would lie down in peace\r\n     and safety, and would not have entailed on them an unnatural and\r\n     odious system, productive of strife, enmity and war, between\r\n     themselves and their domestics. I was in hopes to have been able\r\n     by this time to have informed you and my other friends of the\r\n     result of the malicious suit instituted against me for freeing my\r\n     negroes, and which is pending in our Supreme Court. The case was\r\n     argued last week, but the court has adjourned to the 1st Monday\r\n     of January, next, without deciding it. I was much disappointed in\r\n     not getting a decision; I have however but little fear as to the\r\n     result.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[230] These letters are taken from E. B. Washburne's _Sketch of Edward\r\nColes, Second Governor of Illinois, and of the Slavery Struggle of\r\n1823-1824_.\r\n\r\n[231] _Ibid._, p. 18.\r\n\r\n[232] Jefferson's reply was published in THE JOURNAL OP NEGRO HISTORY,\r\nVol. III, p. 83.\r\n\r\n[233] The last paragraph of Mr. Birkbeck's letter cannot but excite\r\nadmiration. The quotation from Horace applied with great force to the\r\ncase of Governor Coles:\r\n\r\n\"Neither the ardor of citizens ordering base things, nor the face of\r\nthe threatening tyrant shakes a man just and tenacious of principle\r\nfrom his firm intentions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME UNDISTINGUISHED NEGROES\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLOMON HUMPHRIES. Traveling through this country in 1833 at the very\r\ntime when free Negroes were being denounced as an evil of which this\r\ncountry should by all means rid itself, C. D. Arfwedson found in\r\nMacon, Georgia a thrifty free Negro named Solomon Humphries, well\r\nknown by all classes including local officials and even the governor\r\nof the State. Humphries had by dint of energy acquired his freedom and\r\nhad made himself an asset in his community. He was then keeping a\r\nlarge grocery store and had more credit than many other merchants in\r\nthe town, for he had accumulated about $20,000 worth of property. He\r\nhad a neat and comfortably furnished home, presided over by his wife,\r\nan intelligent woman of color, who was often seen driving with him in\r\nhis own unostentatious carriage. He was sought by the wealthiest\r\npeople of the city whom he lavishly entertained at his home, doing\r\nthem the honor of waiting on them in person himself, although he had a\r\nnumber of slaves who could have rendered this service. Making it a\r\nrule to be especially hospitable to strangers, he invited Arfwedson to\r\nbe his guest while in the city; but on account of having planned\r\nto go to Columbus that day, Arfwedson could not accept his\r\ninvitation.--_Arfwedson's United States and Canada in 1833 and 1834_,\r\nI, p. 425.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA NEGRO COLONIZATIONIST. While the American Colonization Society was\r\nbeing denounced by the free Negroes of the North, many blacks of the\r\nsame status in the South had a different attitude toward the movement,\r\nespecially during the twenties before it had been discovered that\r\nLiberia was not suitable for a civilized people. One of the Negroes of\r\nthe South to be won to this movement was a free man of color named\r\nCreighton, a slave owner of Charleston, South Carolina. He had\r\naccumulated considerable wealth and had begun to feel that it would be\r\nbetter for him to spend his remaining days in a land of freedom.\r\nSeveral other free blacks were induced to go with him. In disposing of\r\nhis property he offered his slaves, the alternative of being liberated\r\non the condition of accompanying him on his expedition or of remaining\r\nin this country to be sold as other property. Only one of his slaves\r\ncould be prevailed upon to accept freedom on these terms and go with\r\nhim to Liberia. Creighton then closed up his business in Charleston,\r\npurchased for the enterprise a schooner _The Calypso_ and set sail for\r\nAfrica, October 17, 1821.--_Niles Register_, XXI, p. 163; taken from\r\n_The New York Commercial Advertiser_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA MORALIST. A white cooper called upon a Negro who owned a fine farm\r\nnear Cincinnati and expressed a desire to purchase some stave timber\r\nfrom him. The Negro inquired as to what use the cooper would make of\r\nit. The latter replied that he had a contract to make some whisky\r\nbarrels.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Sir,\" was the prompt reply, \"I have the timber and want the\r\nmoney, but no man can purchase a single stave or hoop pole, or a\r\nparticle of grain from me for that purpose.\"\r\n\r\nThe cooper, of course, became unusually angry on receiving such a\r\nstern reproof and contemptuously addressed this man of color, calling\r\nhim a \"Nigger.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is very true,\" mildly replied the Negro. \"I can't help that, but\r\nI _can_ help selling my timber to make whisky barrels, and I mean to\r\ndo it.\"--_The Weekly Herald and Philanthropist_, May 13, 1846.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA BENEVOLENT NEGRO. Before the Northwest Territory became disturbed by\r\nthe influx of free Negroes and fugitives running away from persecution\r\nin the South, there had been enough trouble with white vagrants to\r\nlead to drastic laws for the protection of certain communities.\r\nMichigan, which did not until 1827 pass a measure dealing especially\r\nwith undesirable Negroes, had prior to this time a law providing for\r\nselling idle and dissolute persons at auction. At one of the sales in\r\n1821 a Negro bought a white man and ordered him to follow his master,\r\nand the order was obeyed. But the benevolent black took his servant to\r\nthe steamboat, paid his passage and restored him his freedom, making\r\nhimself satisfied with sending the white vagrant out of the\r\nterritory.--_Niles Register_, XXI, p. 214.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK REVIEWS\r\n\r\n\r\n_Harvard Studies._ I. _Varia Africana._ I. ORIC BATES, Editor, F. H.\r\nSTERNS, Asst. Editor. Introduction by THEODORE ROOSEVELT. The African\r\nDepartment of the Peabody Museum of Harvard University, Cambridge,\r\n1917. Quarto. Pp. 292.\r\n\r\nIn the introduction to the Harvard African studies ex-President\r\nRoosevelt describes the enterprise which this volume represents as\r\n\"the first serious attempt by Americans to contribute to the real\r\nstudy of the African.\" He might have added, with almost equal truth,\r\nthat it is the first serious attempt by Americans to study the Negro.\r\n\r\nBooks have been written by Americans about the black man. Howard\r\nUniversity, Washington, D. C., has a library of such books. There are\r\nother private collections, some of them running into several thousand\r\nvolumes. Most of them are written in a controversial spirit. Many of\r\nthem are theological, seeking to show, on the basis of scriptural\r\nquotations, that the social status of the black man is pre-ordained\r\nand eternally fixed. Others are pseudo-scientific attempts to solve\r\nthe race problem by showing that the black man is not quite human.\r\nSome of them seek to prove, on the basis of anthropological data, that\r\nthe Negro has no soul, hence efforts to Christianize him are\r\nhopeless.--Many more are written by Negroes to preserve some record of\r\ntheir meager history, or to defend the race against the monstrous\r\nattacks upon its humanity.\r\n\r\nSuch books are interesting and valuable as records of the sentiments\r\nand attitudes which the racial struggle has called forth in the black\r\nman and in the white. The strange distortions of fact and opinion\r\nwhich they record are significant, not so much for what they tell us\r\nof the Negro, as for what they reveal of the intensity of the racial\r\nconflict, and of the nature of the passions involved. Most books on\r\nthe Negro in America published prior to 1900, and some books written\r\nsince that time, are mainly valuable as source books for the social\r\npsychologist and the students of human nature. As literature they\r\nrepresent a melancholy anthology. As records of human nature, under\r\nthe strains and stresses of a tragic although peaceful conflict, they\r\nhave a new and fascinating interest. It is in this sense that we can\r\nsay, spite of all that has been written, that there are no scientific\r\nstudies of the American Negro, there are only materials awaiting\r\nscientific interpretation.\r\n\r\nIt must be regarded as an event of the first importance, therefore,\r\nthat an institution of the authority of Harvard University and the\r\nPeabody Museum proposes to publish a series of studies intended to\r\ncover the whole wide range of native African life and to extend these\r\nstudies eventually to the descendants of the African peoples in\r\nAmerica. No study of the Negro in America will be complete which does\r\nnot take account of the African background of the race. On the other\r\nhand, no attempt to assess the qualities and capacities of the native\r\nAfrican, living in his isolated and primitive environment, will be\r\nadequate which does not take account of the Negro's progress under the\r\nconditions of a civilized environment. As a matter of fact the\r\nAfricans are the only contemporaneous primitive people who have\r\nanywhere achieved race consciousness and civilization without losing\r\ntheir racial identity. As a consequence almost every fundamental\r\nprocess and stage of civilization, from the most primitive to the most\r\ncosmopolitan man, is somewhere represented in the contemporary life of\r\nthe Negro in Africa and America. It is this fact which lends\r\nsignificance to the present volume, since these studies propose to\r\ncover eventually the whole range of Negro life in Africa and America,\r\nso far as that can be done within the limits of the anthropological\r\nsciences. An editorial note at the end of this first volume describes\r\nthe plan and scope of the proposed series of publications.\r\n\r\n     The Harvard African Studies is designed to consist of annual\r\n     volumes--under the title of Varia Africana--made up of\r\n     miscellaneous papers, and of occasional monographs presenting the\r\n     results of original field or laboratory research.\r\n\r\n     The scope of the volumes may be defined as African anthropology\r\n     in the widest sense. Only original papers are desired, but these\r\n     may be of any length compatible with their presentation in a\r\n     volume which is essentially in the nature of a journal, and may\r\n     deal with any of the following subjects: psychology, archaeology,\r\n     ethnography, linguistics, sociology, ethno-geography, religion,\r\n     folklore, or technology. A range so wide must perforce be limited\r\n     in some directions, and the editors have therefore decided upon\r\n     the exclusion of purely historical papers, even when the latter\r\n     embody the political records of native tribes. As an exception to\r\n     this rule, the editors may be willing, under certain\r\n     circumstances, to accept historical material which, by\r\n     establishing the presence of this or that group of people in a\r\n     certain locality, or by throwing light on the nature or date of a\r\n     migration, bears on racial questions and problems of primitive\r\n     culture.\r\n\r\n     The series is open to papers of a non-controversial character\r\n     dealing with a topic sadly in need of more scientific\r\n     treatment--we refer to the question of the American Negro. The\r\n     anthropometrist, the sociologist, and the folklorist have in this\r\n     direction a field of research which, if approached with adequate\r\n     knowledge, can be made to yield invaluable results. As these\r\n     results cannot but be of practical importance, the editors are\r\n     particularly anxious to have an opportunity of presenting them.\r\n\r\nAs a further indication of the method and purpose of these studies the\r\neditors emphasize that an effort will be made not only to add to the\r\nmass of information already extant in the writings of explorers,\r\ntraders, and missionaries, but to correlate and organize the\r\ninformation already existing.\r\n\r\n     Travelers, missionaries, administrators, and scientists have\r\n     published a vast amount of valuable information regarding the\r\n     various peoples and regions in Africa. As yet, however, there has\r\n     been comparatively little correlation of this evidence. Now that\r\n     the day of the reconnaissance explorer is essentially past, and\r\n     we begin to receive accurate and detailed studies of single\r\n     tribes, it is highly desirable to have the great mass of\r\n     published material carefully sifted, so that the future student\r\n     and investigator may be able to make his efforts as productive as\r\n     possible.\r\n\r\n     From even a few such documents, it might be possible to plot\r\n     cultural areas, as has been done for North America--the areas in\r\n     question being regions of fairly uniform culture, marked off with\r\n     some sharpness from other such areas. It would then appear\r\n     whether the African areas depended on geographic conditions, on\r\n     plant or animal distributions, or on the superior inventive\r\n     genius of certain tribes or races. On the other hand, it might\r\n     appear that the whole culture area hypothesis was untenable, and\r\n     that within any given geographic area, or within any given tribe,\r\n     there would exist elements of culture which were adopted at\r\n     widely differing times and belonged to different culture levels.\r\n     Thus, a true stratification of cultures might be exposed. Yet\r\n     again, it might be found that people living in similar\r\n     environments tended to develop a like culture regardless of any\r\n     contact or close ethnic affinities.\r\n\r\nAt the present moment the task of correlating existing material in\r\nsuch a way as to test the validity of current theories and\r\npresuppositions of the anthropological sciences is quite as important\r\nas that of adding to existing collections of information. In this way\r\nonly can the mass of information now extant be made available for the\r\nuse of students in the secondary social sciences, like sociology and\r\npolitical science, which are dealing with immediate and practical\r\nproblems. It is only in this way, for example, that the knowledge we\r\nhave gained of the Negro in Africa will contribute to the solution of\r\nthe race problem in America.\r\n\r\nInteresting as is the prospect which opens with the first volume of\r\nthe African Studies, the untechnical reader will probably be more\r\nimpressed with imposing appearance of the volume, with the character\r\nof its illustration and its general typographical appearance than with\r\nits contents. These consist of twelve articles of an average length of\r\n23 pages dealing with the following types: _Siwan customs_, _Oral\r\nsurgery in Egypt during the Old Empire_, _Worship of the Dead as\r\npracticed by some African Tribes_, _The Paleoliths of the Eastern\r\nDesert_, _Notes on the Nungu Tribe_, _Nassawara Province_, _A study of\r\nthe Ancient Speech of the Canary Islands_, _Benin Antiquities in the\r\nPeabody Museum_, _The Utendi of Mwana Kupon_, _Notes on Egyptian\r\nSaints_, _Dafur Gourds_, _An Inscription from Gebel Barkal_, and\r\n_Ancient Egyptian Fishing_.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most interesting of these articles, for the sociologist,\r\nis that of R. H. Blanchard entitled _Notes an Egyptian Saints_.\r\nSainthood, as the author remarks, \"is not a difficulty of achievement\r\nin the Islamic world.\" Every hamlet has its shrine and in the larger\r\nvillages there will usually be found two or three such sanctuaries.\r\nOnce a year, on his birthday, a festival and religious fair in honor\r\nof the saint is held. The primitive character of these religious\r\ncelebrations is attested by the orgiastic and often licentious\r\nperformances that accompany them. For example on the occasion of the\r\nfestival of el-Hamal et-Rayah, a purely local celebrity, \"the whole\r\nadult male population of the town, in defiance of all orthodox Moslem\r\nsentiment, intoxicated themselves with whatever alcoholic beverages\r\nthey could procure. Half a dozen prostitutes, hired for the occasion,\r\nset up their booths or tents in the town, and received all comers.\r\nThere was among the revelers a great deal of horseplay of the most\r\nlicentious character, particularly in the vicinity of the booths if\r\nthe _sharamit_. Drunken men were dragged into the lanes by their\r\nfriends, and there left lying, exposed to the village wags and wits.\r\nIn 1914 this festival was modified by Government, which suppressed the\r\nmore offensive features of the celebration.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting of these saints referred to was \"an old\r\nNegro slave well known for his long, harmless, pious life.\" It is\r\ngenerally held that the body of a man who has during his life attained\r\nan unusual degree of sanctity is gifted with a supernatural power\r\nwhich is often exerted on those who carry his bier to the grave. The\r\nsupernatural power of this old Negro saint was attested to in the\r\nfollowing peculiar way: \"Having died toward evening, he would not, on\r\nany account, have himself buried the same evening, and the bearers, in\r\nspite of all their shouting of _la ilah ill Alllah_ (sic), could not\r\nbring the corpse to the graveyard. It remained therefore, all night in\r\nthe house (though the people do not like to keep a corpse at night),\r\nwatched by a multitude of people praying. Next morning also it could\r\nnot be buried for a long time, the blessed dead compelled the bearers\r\nto go through all the streets of the town, till at last, on the\r\nrecommendations of the governor, the higher officials carried the bier\r\nto the grave, even the Turkish soldiers could not accomplish it. The\r\nwhole town was in uproar. The Mohammadans say the angels exercise this\r\ncoercive power. The Christians believe it is the devil.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems probable, as the author suggests, that we have in these\r\nreligious festivals in honor of a local celebrity surviving examples\r\nof localized and more primitive type of religious cult which has not\r\nyet been wholly superseded by the religion of Islam, with its wider\r\noutlook and more rational conceptions of life. The notes here recorded\r\nsuggest at once questions which can only be answered by further\r\ninvestigation and by comparison of the materials gathered in this\r\nregion with those that are now being brought to light in other fields.\r\nIt is the purpose of the Harvard African studies to answer these\r\nquestions, so far as they can be answered by a study of African life.\r\n\r\nInteresting from other points of view are the reproductions of the\r\nremarkable collection of Benin antiquities at the Peabody Museum, of\r\nthe celebrated Vai syllabary, and of an interesting poem of 100 lines\r\nin the Suaheli language said to have been dictated by a dying mother\r\nto her daughter. Transliteration and translation accompany the\r\nreproduction in the original script.\r\n\r\n                                   ROBERT E.

Pp.\r\nxiv, 92.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time for the last fifteen years Mr. James Weldon Johnson\r\nhas been remarked as one of the literary men of the race. He has now\r\nbrought together his verses in a little volume, _Fifty Years and Other\r\nPoems_, an introduction to which has been written by Professor Brander\r\nMatthews, of Columbia University. The task was eminently worth while.\r\n\r\nThe book falls into two parts. The first is made up of poems in the\r\ncommonly accepted forms, though there are one or two examples of\r\n_vers libre_; and the second is entitled _Jingles and Croons_. This\r\nsecond division consists of dialect verses, especially the songs that\r\nhave been set to music, most frequently by the poet's brother, Mr. J.\r\nRosamond Johnson. Outstanding are the very first lines, _Since you\r\nwent away_. It is well that these pieces have been brought together.\r\nFor artistic achievement, however, attention will naturally be fixed\r\nupon the first division. _Fifty Years_ was written in honor of the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the emancipation of the race. Professor\r\nMatthews speaks of it as \"one of the noblest commemorative poems yet\r\nwritten by any American--a poem sonorous in its diction, vigorous in\r\nits workmanship, elevated in its imagination, and sincere in its\r\nemotion.\" This is high praise, and yet it may reasonably be asked if\r\nthere are not in the book at least four pieces of finer poetic\r\nquality. These are, first of all, the two poems that originally\r\nappeared in the Century, _Mother Night_ and _O Black and Unknown\r\nBards_, and _The White Witch_ and _The Young Warrior_. The first of\r\nthese four poems is a sonnet well rounded out. The second gains merit\r\nby reason of its strong first and last two stanzas. _The White Witch_\r\nchooses a delicate and difficult theme, but contains some very strong\r\nstanzas. _The Young Warrior_ is a poem of rugged strength and one that\r\ndeserves all the popularity it has achieved with Mr. Burleigh's\r\nmusical setting. Mr. Johnson is strongest in the simple, direct, and\r\nsometimes sensuous expression that characterizes these latter poems,\r\nand it is to be hoped that he may have the time and the inclination to\r\nwrite many more like them.\r\n\r\n                                   BENJAMIN BRAWLEY.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Battles and Victories of Allen Allensworth._ By CHARLES ALEXANDER.\r\nSherman, French and Company, Boston, 1914. Pp. 429.\r\n\r\nHere we have the story of a successful Negro born a slave in Kentucky\r\nbut who, determined to succeed, rose to the distinction of a teacher\r\nand preacher and finally to that of a chaplain in the United States\r\narmy with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. The value of this book to\r\nthe historian, however, is not the mere sketch of Colonel Allensworth\r\nbut the valuable facts bearing on the history of the Negroes in\r\nvarious parts of the United States. The philanthropic attitude of the\r\nQuakers toward Negroes, the life of the slave on the Mississippi, the\r\nrelations between the poor whites and the slaves, the escape of\r\nfugitives to Canada, and the work of the abolitionists are all\r\nmentioned from page to page.\r\n\r\nThe larger portion of the book, however, gives details of the life of\r\nAllensworth, which would interest only those who knew him personally.\r\nBut his founding a town in California inhabited altogether by Negroes\r\nstamps him as a pioneer whose achievements in this field must engage\r\nthe attention of the historian. The detailed accounts of his service\r\nas a chaplain in the United States army in the Spanish-American War\r\nand later in the Philippines add other valuable experiences which the\r\npublic should know. The book contains also references to the work of\r\nFrederick Douglass, Judge William Jay and John Brown. The author\r\nmentions also scores of other persons who have in various ways helped\r\nto make the history of the Negro in the United States and especially\r\nthose who were effective in bringing about the emancipation of the\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nThe style of this book is decidedly rough. The work does not show\r\norganization. It is written in such a way as to indicate that the\r\nwriter recorded his facts as they came to him at random without regard\r\nas to the principles of composition. It was wholly unnecessary for him\r\nto wander astray, discussing in detail the careers of almost every man\r\nof that time influencing the life of the Negro, without showing the\r\nconnection between those facts and the life of the subject of this\r\nsketch. The chief value of this work, therefore, is that of a source\r\nbook.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Negro Migrant in Pittsburgh, A study in Social Economics._ By\r\nABRAHAM EPSTEIN. Published under the supervision of the School of\r\nEconomics, University of Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh, Pa., 1918.\r\n\r\nThe movement of the Negroes from the South to the North during the\r\npresent world war bids fair to be recorded as the most significant\r\nevent of our local history during this decade. In about two years a\r\nmillion Negroes have gone North to take the places of those immigrants\r\nwho annually sought our shores prior to this upheaval. To show the\r\nsignificance of the exodus a number of writers have sketched it in\r\nnewspapers and magazines. Books bearing on the subject are\r\nforthcoming. The first scientific study of the transplanted southern\r\nNegroes to appear in print, however, is Epstein's interesting and\r\nvaluable work.\r\n\r\nDeparting from the newspaper Pullman-palace-car method of studying\r\nsocial conditions, Mr. Epstein assiduously applied himself to the task\r\nof making a house-to-house investigation of the home life of this\r\nlarge and typical community of Negroes recently brought to the North.\r\nHe learned whence they came, their antecedent circumstances, why they\r\nabandoned their old homes, what they seek in the North and to what\r\nextent they are realizing their dreams. The various factors\r\ncontributing to the solution of their local problems in Pittsburgh and\r\nthose effective in confusing the situation are well treated.\r\n\r\nThis work is especially valuable in its portrayal of home conditions.\r\nThe author directed his attention to what these migrants do, where\r\nthey live, how they spend their earnings and how they amuse\r\nthemselves. In this treatment, therefore, appears a discussion of\r\nhealth, disease and crime as influenced by the presence of these\r\nnewcomers from a section in which their condition differed materially\r\nfrom what they find in the North. Whether or not we agree with him in\r\nhis conclusions, therefore, this treatise must claim the attention of\r\nstudents of present-day problems, desiring to deal with facts rather\r\nthan theories.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, Mr. Epstein does not find the Negro an exception to any\r\nother migrant. Most of the facts which he sets forth are after all\r\nfavorable to blacks when one considers that their peculiar\r\ncircumstances are due to race prejudice and the proscription of trades\r\nunions. The author did not find them unusually afflicted with disease,\r\nas was predicted, and he saw no evidence of a wave of crime. Most of\r\nthe offenses charged to the account of the migrants are of the petty\r\nsort which arise from the stimulus given such by the denizens of vice\r\ntolerated by the community. Students of Negro life and history,\r\ntherefore, should read this dissertation.\r\n\r\n                                   C. G. WOODSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Oswald Garrison Villard who was kind enough to call our attention\r\nto the misprint of Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton Hart, for Sir Thomas\r\nFowell Buxton, Bart., on page 20 of the January number of THE JOURNAL\r\nOF NEGRO HISTORY, has sent us the following note in William Lloyd\r\nGarrison's own words concerning his relations with this distinguished\r\nfriend of the Negro in England:\r\n\r\n\"On arriving in London I received a polite invitation by letter from\r\nMr. Buxton to take breakfast with him. Presenting myself at the\r\nappointed time, when my name was announced, instead of coming forward\r\npromptly to take me by the hand, he scrutinized me from head to foot,\r\nand then inquired, somewhat dubiously, 'Have I the pleasure of\r\naddressing Mr. Garrison, of Boston, in the United States?' 'Yes, sir,'\r\nI replied, 'I am he; and I am here in accordance with your\r\ninvitation.' Lifting up his hands he exclaimed, 'Why, my dear sir, I\r\nthought you were a black man! And I have consequently invited this\r\ncompany of ladies and gentlemen to be present to welcome Mr. Garrison,\r\nthe black advocate of emancipation from the United States of America!'\r\nI have often said that that is the only compliment I have ever had\r\npaid to me that I care to remember, or to tell of! For Mr. Buxton had\r\nsomehow or other supposed that no white American could plead for those\r\nin bondage as I had done, and therefore I must be black!\"\r\n\r\n\"The worthy successor of Wilberforce, our esteemed friend and\r\ncoadjutor, Thomas Fowell Buxton,\" had this picture drawn of him by his\r\nguest (Mr. Garrison) on his return to America:\r\n\r\n\"Buxton has sufficient fleshly timber to make two or three\r\nWilberforces. He is six feet and a half in height, though rather\r\nslender than robust. What a formidable leader of the anti-slavery\r\ncause in appearance! We always felt delighted to see him rise in his\r\nseat in Parliament to address the House, for his towering form\r\nliterally caused his pro-slavery opponents to 'hide their diminished\r\nheads.' He is a very good speaker, but not an orator: his manner is\r\ndignified, sincere, and conciliating, and his language without\r\npretence. But he has hardly decision, energy, and boldness enough for\r\na leader. His benevolent desires for the emancipation of the colonial\r\nslaves led him to accede to a sordid compromise with the planters, and\r\nhe advocated the proposition to remunerate these enemies of the human\r\nrace, and to buy up wholesale robbery and oppression, in opposition to\r\nthe remonstrances of the great body of English abolitionists, and it\r\nfurnishes a dangerous precedent in the overthrow of established\r\niniquity and crime throughout the world. The results of the bargain do\r\nnot (January, 1836) reach Mr. Buxton's anticipations.... Still, aside\r\nfrom this false step, Mr. Buxton deserves universal admiration and\r\ngratitude for his long-continued, able and disinterested efforts,\r\namidst severe ridicule and malignant opposition, to break every yoke\r\nand set the oppressed free.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPresident Nathan B. Young, of the Florida Agricultural and Mechanical\r\nCollege, has kindly directed our attention to the following facts\r\nwhich appeared in an article in the _Tampa Tribune_, showing how\r\nadoption of the Thirteenth Amendment was effected:\r\n\r\n\"How the vote that made the Federal amendment abolishing slavery was\r\npolled in the house of representatives on January 26, 1863, was told\r\nto a representative of _The Tribune_ yesterday by the reading clerk of\r\nthat congress--now a Florida winter resident and nearing ninety years\r\nof age.\r\n\r\n\"A change of two votes would have defeated the amendment; and urgent\r\nbusiness kept one man from being present to cast his vote against the\r\nmeasure, so it is seen that history came near being made another way\r\nthat memorable day.\r\n\r\n\"The story was told, with all the vigor and freshness of a man just\r\nfrom the existing scenes and actions, by E. W. Barber, editor of the\r\nJackson (Mich.) _Daily Patriot_, now at Crooked Lake, happy in the\r\nsummer of Florida's winter. Mr. Barber was reading clerk for the\r\nthirty-eighth, thirty-ninth and fortieth congresses, from December,\r\n1863 to 1869; and he is today the only official of that body who is\r\nliving. He will be ninety years old on the third of July, coming, and\r\nis wonderfully preserved, all except his leg. Indeed he laughingly\r\ndeclared that he would have been a dead tree if he had not been pruned\r\nof a dead limb!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tells of Memorable Day_\r\n\r\n\"On the morning of December 26, 1863, said Mr. Barber, there was a\r\nstillness in the house that betokened doubt even then of the passage\r\nof the amendment, for but four men in the world knew that it was a\r\nmatter of accomplishment before the roll was called.\r\n\r\n\"The senate had already passed the amendment, he said, and the house\r\nhad defeated it in the first session of the congress; and there was a\r\ndoubt of its passage over in the lower body.\r\n\r\n\"After its defeat in the house, the party machinery was put in motion\r\nto bring into line sufficient votes to make the necessary\r\nthree-fourths required. J. M. Ashley of Toledo and Augustus Frank of\r\nWarsaw, N. Y., were appointed a committee of two to see if votes\r\nenough could be secured at the short session to pass the bill through\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\n\"Edward W. Barber, the reading clerk, and Richard U. Sherman, the\r\ntally clerk, kept a secret rollcall under lock and key in their desk,\r\nand on this was marked the name of every man who had voted against the\r\namendment. As a man was changed or converted, his name was reported to\r\nthese two and his name added to those already secured for the\r\namendment. One by one the change came, and at last one day when a name\r\nwas added--the member from the Gettysburg district--Ashley exclaimed\r\n\"There, by God. We've got enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"That day in the house Ashley, who had changed his vote to \"nay\" after\r\nthe defeat of the bill earlier so he could move its reconsideration,\r\nand had complied with that parliamentary condition, gave notice that\r\non January 26 he would call up the bill for a vote.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Measure Sways in Balance_\r\n\r\n\"Betting ran high for and against the passage of the amendment, says\r\nMr. Barber. The odds were that it would not be passed because of the\r\nviolent opposition which it had evoked at the former attempt. There\r\nwere but four men who knew how the matter would go, and those were E.\r\nW. Barber, reading clerk; Richard U. Sherman, tally clerk; J. M.\r\nAshley, and Augustus Frank, the committee of two named to get the\r\nproper number of votes for the bill.\r\n\r\n\"The margin was close, two changes would have defeated it; and one\r\nmember opposed to the amendment was absent, so he said afterward,\r\nbecause a large number of soldiers from his state were at Aquia Creek,\r\nand he felt he must pay them some attention. The name of this member\r\nwas not given.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Barber is still editing his paper, sending some fourteen\r\neditorials a week to Jackson, Mich., for publication in _The Daily\r\nPatriot_, from his Florida home, five miles south of Lake Wales.\r\n\r\n\"He has been coming to Florida for forty-five years and, while he has\r\nbeen delaying his coming until well into December, he said yesterday\r\nthat from now on he expects to come early in November and stay until\r\nwell into spring.\r\n\r\n\"He is a most entertaining and interesting speaker and is full of\r\nenthusiasm for his adopted home and his future prospects here.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA group of Southern folks have organized a Southern Publicity\r\nCommittee to advertise among themselves some of the South's\r\nconstructive work in racial matters.

Much has been written of slavery in other States, but\r\nthere has not been published a single account which deals adequately\r\nwith the institution in Kentucky. A scholarly treatise on _The\r\nAnti-Slavery Movement in Kentucky_, by Professor Asa E. Martin, of\r\nPennsylvania State College, has appeared but, as this work is limited\r\nto a discussion of the history of the movement to overthrow slavery,\r\nour study parallels and supplements it.\r\n\r\nIn this study the chief emphasis has been placed upon the legal,\r\neconomic and social history of slavery in Kentucky, mention being made\r\nof a few of the interesting anti-slavery incidents when these are\r\nknown to have influenced the local status of the slave. We have first\r\nconsidered the inception of the system as based fundamentally upon the\r\ntype of land settlement and tenure, followed by a study of the growth\r\nof the slave population, which brings in the question of the local\r\neconomic value of the slave. An attempt has been made to explain the\r\ninternal slave trade; and to consider to what extent Kentucky served\r\nas a breeding State for slaves destined to the market in the lower\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on the legal status of slavery special emphasis has\r\nbeen placed not only upon the legal position of the institution but\r\nupon the general evolution of the rights of the Negro in servitude.\r\nThis section is vitally connected with the anti-slavery movement after\r\nabout the year 1835. The problem of the fugitive slave and the general\r\nrights of emancipation and of the freed Negro have been approached\r\npurely from the legal standpoint.\r\n\r\nThe chapter on the social status of the slave considers the conditions\r\nof slave life that were more or less peculiar to Kentucky. There has\r\noften been made the statement, that in Kentucky Negro servitude was\r\ngenerally on a higher plane than in the States to the south and the\r\ntreatment of slaves was much more humane. Some light has been thrown\r\non these questions.\r\n\r\nAs a supplement to the discussion of the legal and social status a\r\ngeneral summary of public opinion regarding emancipation and\r\ncolonization has been added. Although for the most part consisting of\r\npreviously published material this section has been treated from the\r\nviewpoint of the existing institution and not from the anti-slavery\r\nside which occasioned most of the original publication.\r\n\r\nThis study has been made from a consideration of the contemporary\r\nevidence as found in newspapers, statements of slaves, and general\r\nevidence of travelers and citizens of Kentucky during the period\r\nbefore the Civil War. The material for the study of this field is not\r\nonly scattered throughout the country but for the most part it is very\r\nmeager compared with the records of States like Virginia and Missouri.\r\nAll the documents, papers, manuscripts and works known to be of value,\r\nhowever, have been consulted. The most valuable records for this\r\ntreatise are to be found in the Durrett Collection at the University\r\nof Chicago, the extensive files of early Kentucky papers in the\r\nLibrary of the American Antiquarian Society, and the documents in the\r\nKentucky State Library at Frankfort.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Clarence S. Brigham, of the American Antiquarian Society, Mr.\r\nEdward A. Henry, of the University of Chicago Library, and Mr. Frank\r\nKavanaugh, of the Kentucky State Library, I am indebted for invaluable\r\nassistance rendered in securing material for this work. The treatment\r\nof the legal status of slavery would have been very meager, were it\r\nnot for the valuable aid given by Dr. George E. Wire, of the Worcester\r\nCounty (Massachusetts) Law Library. To Miss Florence Dillard, of the\r\nLexington (Kentucky) Public Library, I am indebted for assistance\r\ngiven throughout the period of my studies. To Prof. George H.\r\nBlakeslee, of Clark University, I owe more than to any one else--for\r\nhis inspiration during my three years of study, for his most valuable\r\naid in the correction of the manuscript, his candid judgment and\r\njudicial reasoning and the many suggestions which have helped to make\r\nthis study what it is.\r\n\r\n                                   IVAN E.

Between 1782 and 1802 the seven States\r\nwhich had interest in western lands ceded their rights to the United\r\nStates and all that territory with the exception of Kentucky and the\r\nConnecticut Reserve in Ohio was made a part of the public domain.\r\nHence, one of the distinguishing features of the settlement of\r\nKentucky as compared with Ohio was that in the latter State the land\r\nwas sold by the Federal Government to settlers coming from all parts\r\nof the country but particularly from the northeastern section. The\r\nresult of this was that few citizens of Ohio held more than 640 acres.\r\n\r\nKentucky had been reserved by Virginia and consequently the method of\r\nsettlement was purely a matter governed by that State and was separate\r\nand apart from the system which was employed by the United States\r\nGovernment. Furthermore, Kentucky lands were all given out by 1790,\r\njust one year after the beginning of our national period. The federal\r\nland policy was at that time just beginning. Virginia gave out the\r\nlands in Kentucky by what is known as the patent system, and all the\r\nsettlers in Kentucky held their lands by one of three different kinds\r\nof rights.\r\n\r\nIn the first place there were those who were given tracts in the new\r\nterritory as a reward for military services which had been rendered in\r\nthe Revolution. This had been provided for by the legislature of\r\nVirginia as early as December, 1778.[234] No land north of the Ohio\r\nRiver was to be granted out as a military bounty until all the \"good\r\nlands\" in the Kentucky region had been exhausted. The size of these\r\ntracts was to be governed by the official status of the recipient in\r\nthe late war, and the bounties finally granted by Virginia ranged all\r\nthe way from one hundred to fifteen thousand acres.[235]\r\n\r\nThe Virginia legislature of 1779 found it necessary to establish a\r\nsecond method of settlement in Kentucky in response to the demands of\r\nthe large number of people who were migrating to the west of the\r\nAlleghenies. Provision was made for the granting of preemption rights\r\nto new settlers and also for the introduction of a very generous\r\nsystem of settlement rights. These settlement and preemption rights\r\nwere almost inseparable, as the latter was dependent upon the former.\r\nIt was provided that four hundred acres of land would be given to\r\nevery person or family who had settled in the region before the first\r\nof January, 1778.[236] The word \"settlement\" was stated to mean either\r\na residence of one year in the territory or the raising of a crop of\r\ncorn. In addition to the above grant every man who had built only a\r\ncabin or made any improvement on the land was entitled to a preemption\r\nof one thousand acres, providing such improvements had been made prior\r\nto January 1, 1778. Preference in the grants was to be given to the\r\nearly settlers and even the most famous heroes of the Revolution were\r\nnot allowed to interfere with the rights of those who held a\r\ncertificate of settlement.\r\n\r\nThus far provision had been made only for those who had settled before\r\n1778. To them was given the best of the land. Thereafter all\r\nsettlement and preemption rights ceased and the further distribution\r\nof land in Kentucky was by means of treasury warrants. A person\r\ndesiring land in Kentucky would appear at one of the Virginia land\r\noffices and make an entry and pay a fee amounting to about two cents\r\nper acre. The paper he would receive would give the approximate\r\nlocation of the tract and the recipient would proceed to have the\r\nland surveyed at his pleasure. Within three months after the survey\r\nhad been made he was to appear at the land office and have the same\r\nrecorded. A copy of this record was to be taken to the assistant\r\nregister of the land office in Kentucky and there it was to remain six\r\nmonths in order to give prior settlers, if any, the right to prove\r\ntheir claims to the property. No such evidence being produced a final\r\nrecord of the patent was to be made and a copy given to the original\r\ngrantee.[237]\r\n\r\nAn interesting example of this method of settlement is shown by the\r\nexperience of Abraham Lincoln, the grandfather of President Lincoln.\r\nOn March 4, 1780, soon after the establishment of the new system, he\r\nappeared at the land office in Richmond, Virginia, and was given three\r\ntreasury warrants, each for four hundred acres of land in Kentucky.\r\nThe first and third of these warrants were not returned for the final\r\nrecording until May 16, 1787, at which time Beverly Randolph, Governor\r\nof Virginia, issued a final deed of 800 acres of land in Lincoln\r\nCounty, Kentucky, to Abraham Lincoln.[238] The second treasury warrant\r\nwas not returned until July 2, 1798, more than a decade after the\r\ndeath of Abraham Lincoln and six years after Kentucky had become a\r\nState. At that time the warrant was presented with a record of the\r\nsurvey by Mordecai Lincoln, the eldest son of Abraham. After some\r\nperiod of investigation the deed for the four hundred acres in\r\nJefferson County was turned over to Mordecai Lincoln on April 26,\r\n1799.[239]\r\n\r\nThe result of this method of granting land was that Kentucky was\r\nsettled by a comparatively few men who rented their property to\r\ntenants. A large number of the military bounties were never settled by\r\nthe original owners but were farmed by the later incoming tenant\r\nclass. George Washington had been given five thousand acres and this\r\nland was actually settled by the poorer white element. In the case of\r\nthe land warrant property it was true that it was usually granted to\r\nthe poorer class of early settlers but as in the instance of the\r\nLincoln family the land soon passed into the hands of the wealthier\r\nsettlers either by purchase or through law suits. It is commonly\r\nstated that Daniel Boone thus became landless and was forced to\r\nmigrate to Missouri.[240]\r\n\r\nThus we see that Kentucky was distinctly different from all the other\r\nsettlements to the west of the Alleghenies in the original system of\r\nland tenure and she further inherited from her mother State of\r\nVirginia the ancient theory of a landed aristocracy which was based\r\nupon tenantry. The early inhabitants of Kentucky can be easily divided\r\ninto three classes, the landed proprietors, their slaves, and the\r\ntenant class of whites. The second and third classes tended to keep\r\nalive the status of the former and led to the perpetuation of the\r\nlanded aristocracy. In Kentucky, however, the laws of descent were\r\nalways against primogeniture and this resulted in the division of the\r\nlands of the wealthier class with each new generation.\r\n\r\nThe institution of slavery in Kentucky, as in every other State,\r\ndepended for the most part upon the existence of large plantations.\r\nThe only reason Kentucky had such large estates was because of the\r\nmethod by which the land was given out by the mother State.\r\nEconomically Kentucky was not adapted to plantation life. The greater\r\npart of the State required then, as it still does, the personal care\r\nand supervision of the owner or tenant. The original distribution of\r\nland made this impossible and there grew up a large class of\r\nlandholders who seldom labored with their hands, because of the\r\ntraditional system. A large number of inhabitants as early as 1805,\r\nMichaux found, were cultivating their lands themselves, but those who\r\ncould do so had all the work done by Negro slaves.[241]\r\n\r\nWith passing years, while Kentucky maintained slavery, it came to\r\nhave a social system not like that in the South but one more like the\r\ntypical structure of the middle nineteenth century West. There were\r\nseveral reasons for this. In the first place, the absence of the\r\npolicy of primogeniture in time came to distribute the lands over a\r\nmuch larger population. In the second place, while all the land in\r\nKentucky had been granted by the year 1790, the patrician land-holding\r\nelement was completely submerged by the flood of so-called plebeians\r\nwho came in soon after Kentucky became a State. In 1790 there were\r\nonly 61,133 white people in Kentucky, and although all the land had\r\nbeen granted, the white population in the next decade nearly tripled,\r\nreaching 179,871 in 1800, and this increase, at a slightly smaller\r\nrate, continued down to about 1820. Still further the nature of the\r\nsoil made it more profitable for the wealthier landed class to let out\r\ntheir holdings to the incoming whites who did their own work and in\r\ntime came to own the property. \"Each year increased this element of\r\nthe state at the expense of the larger properties.\"[242]\r\n\r\nPOPULATION FROM 1790 TO 1860 WITH RATES OF INCREASE\r\n+=======================================================================+\r\n|    |       |Per   |       |Per   |       |Per   |              |Per   |\r\n|    | White |Cent  |Free   |Cent  |Slave  |Cent  | Total        |Cent  |\r\n|    |       |Incr. |Colored|Incr. |       |Incr. |              |Incr. |\r\n+----+-------+------+-------+------+-------+------+--------------+------+\r\n|1790| 61,133|      |    114|      | 11,830|      |   73,077     |      |\r\n|1800|179,871|194.22|    741|550.00| 40,343|241.02|  220,955     |202.36|\r\n|1810|324,237| 80.26|  1,713|131.17| 80,561| 99.69|  406,511     | 83.98|\r\n|1820|434,644| 34.05|  2,759| 61.06|126,732| 57.31|  564,317[243]| 38.82|\r\n|1830|517,787| 19.12|  4,917| 78.21|165,213| 30.36|  687,917     | 21.09|\r\n|1840|590,253| 13.99|  7,317| 48.81|182,258| 10.31|  779,828     | 13.36|\r\n|1850|761,413| 28.99| 10,011| 36.81|210,981| 15.75|  982,405     | 25.98|\r\n|1860|919,484| 20.76| 10,684|  6.72|225,483|  6.87|1,155,684[244]| 17.64|\r\n\r\nA study of the growth of the slave and white population of Kentucky\r\nfrom 1790 to 1860 is necessary to an adequate understanding of the\r\nslave problem. It will be found advantageous to deal with two sets of\r\nfigures--one relating to the slave population within the State and the\r\nother with the slave increase in Kentucky as compared with the\r\ngeneral increase throughout the United States. It would not be of any\r\nvalue to compare the figures for Kentucky with those of any other\r\nState, for that would involve the discussion of local factors which\r\nare beyond the scope of this investigation.\r\n\r\nFirst of all we shall take the census statistics for the State for all\r\neight of the enumerations which were taken during the slavery era. The\r\nfigures for the year 1790 were originally taken when Kentucky was a\r\npart of the State of Virginia, but they are included, since Kentucky\r\nbecame a State before the census was published. Furthermore they\r\nfurnish an interesting light upon the growth of the slave population\r\nduring the first decade of the new commonwealth. The important part of\r\nthis table is in the increases, on a percentage basis, in the slave\r\nand white populations. Another viewpoint of the growth of the slave\r\npopulation may be seen in this little table:\r\n\r\n  RATIO OF SLAVES TO THE TOTAL POPULATION\r\n\r\n        Per Cent\r\n  1790    16.1\r\n  1800    18.2\r\n  1810    19.18\r\n  1820    22.4\r\n  1830    24.0\r\n  1840    23.3\r\n  1850    21.4\r\n  1860    19.5\r\n\r\nHere it will be seen that the proportion of slaves increased down to\r\n1830 and then began to decline. Most authorities are agreed that this\r\nwas in a large measure due to the enactment of the law of 1833\r\nforbidding the importation of slaves into Kentucky. But before dealing\r\nwith that question it would be well to have before us the figures for\r\nthe whole country at the same period.\r\n\r\n\r\n  FREE NEGRO AND SLAVE POPULATION OF THE UNITED STATES, 1790 TO 1860,\r\n  WITH RATES OF INCREASE\r\n\r\n  ====================================================================\r\n       | Free Negro |Per Cent Increase| Slaves   |Per Cent Increase  |\r\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  1790 |    59,557  |                 |  697,624 |                   |\r\n  1800 |   108,435  |       82.1      |  893,602 |        28.1       |\r\n  1810 |   186,446  |       71.9      |1,191,362 |        33.3       |\r\n  1820 |   233,634  |       25.3      |1,538,022 |        29.1       |\r\n  1830 |   319,599  |       36.8      |2,009,043 |        30.6       |\r\n  1840 |   386,293  |       20.9      |2,487,355 |        23.8       |\r\n  1850 |   434,495  |       12.5      |3,204,313 |        28.8       |\r\n  1860 |   488,070  |       12.3      |3,953,760 |        23.4       |\r\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe facts seem more significant, if we compare the slave increase in\r\nKentucky with that of the Negroes in the country as a whole. Bearing\r\nin mind that Kentucky was a comparatively new region when it became a\r\nState and that at that time slavery was firmly established along the\r\nseaboard, we are not surprised to find that the slave increase in\r\nKentucky was much more rapid for the first three or four decades than\r\nit was in the nation as a whole. After the year 1830 the increase in\r\nthe United States, on a percentage basis, was much greater than in\r\nKentucky. It seems that the institution started in with a boom and\r\nthen eventually died down in Kentucky.\r\n\r\nThere were several reasons for this fact. A glance at the increase of\r\nwhites in Kentucky for the last three decades will show that they were\r\nforging ahead while the slaves were relatively declining. This was due\r\nto a large amount of immigration of that class of white people who\r\nwere not slaveholding. A second factor was the non-importation act of\r\n1833. About the same time there came to be a conviction among a large\r\nportion of the population that slavery in Kentucky was economically\r\nunprofitable. There is abundant ground for the position that the law\r\nof 1833 was passed because of a firm conviction that there were enough\r\nslaves in the State. The only ones who could profit by any amount of\r\nimportation were the slave dealers and beyond a certain point even\r\ntheir trade would prove unprofitable. If there was ever a single\r\nslaveholder who defended importation on the ground that more slaves\r\nwere needed in Kentucky he never spoke out in public and gave his\r\nreasons for such a position.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there are few statistics concerning the number of\r\nslaveholders in Kentucky. Cassius M. Clay in his appeal to the people\r\nin 1845 stated that there were 31,495 owners of slaves in the\r\nState.[245] The same year the auditor's tax books showed that there\r\nwere 176,107 slaves in Kentucky.[246] This would mean an average of\r\n5.5 slaves for each owner. The accuracy of these figures is\r\nsubstantiated by those for the census of 1850 which gave 210,981\r\nslaves held by 38,456 slaveholders or an average of 5.4 to each owner.\r\nThese holders were classified according to the number of slaves held\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  Holders of 1 slave                            9,244\r\n  Holders of over 1 and less than 5 slaves     13,284\r\n  Holders of 5 and under 10 slaves              9,579\r\n  Holders of 10 and under 20 slaves             5,022\r\n  Holders of 20 and under 50 slaves             1,198\r\n  Holders of 50 and under 100 slaves               53\r\n  Holders of 100 and under 200 slaves               5\r\n                                               38,385[247]\r\n\r\nThis distribution shows that, although the average number of slaves\r\nheld may have been 5.4 for each slaveholder, 21,528 or 50 per cent of\r\nthem held less than five slaves each, and that 34,129 or 88 per cent\r\nheld less than 20 each. Of the 132,920 free families in the State only\r\n28 per cent held any slaves at all. This was somewhat below the\r\naverage for the whole South. The total number of families holding\r\nslaves in the United States, by the census of 1850, was 347,525. With\r\nan average of 5.7 persons to each family there were about 2,000,000\r\npersons in the relation of slave owners, or about one third of the\r\nwhole white population of the slave States. In South Carolina,\r\nAlabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana about one half of the white\r\npopulation was thus classified. As stated above, this percentage in\r\nKentucky was only twenty-eight.\r\n\r\nThis comparison can be more clearly shown by a table of the slave\r\nStates from the census of 1850 showing the number of white people, the\r\nslaveholders, slaves, and the average number of slaves for each\r\nslaveholder.\r\n\r\n  ======================================================================\r\n                | Whites | Slave   |Per Cent  | Slaves | Average per   |\r\n                |        | holders |of Whites |        | Holder        |\r\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Alabama       | 426,514|  29,295 |    6.8   | 342,844|     11.6      |\r\n  Arkansas      | 162,189|   5,999 |    3.7   |  47,100|      7.8      |\r\n  Florida       |  47,203|   3,520 |    7.4   |  39,310|     11.1      |\r\n  Georgia       | 521,572|  38,456 |    7.3   | 381,622|      9.9      |\r\n  Kentucky      | 761,413|  38,385 |    5.0   | 210,981|      5.4      |\r\n  Louisiana     | 255,491|  20,670 |    8.0   | 244,809|     11.4      |\r\n  Maryland      | 417,943|  16,040 |    3.8   |  90,368|      5.6      |\r\n  Mississippi   | 295,718|  23,116 |    7.8   | 309,878|     13.4      |\r\n  Missouri      | 592,004|  19,185 |    3.2   |  87,422|      4.5      |\r\n  North Carolina| 553,028|  28,303 |    5.1   | 288,548|     10.2      |\r\n  South Carolina| 274,563|  25,596 |    9.3   | 384,984|     15.0      |\r\n  Tennessee     | 756,836|  33,864 |    4.4   | 239,459|      7.0      |\r\n  Texas         | 154,034|   7,747 |    5.2   |  58,161|      7.5      |\r\n  Virginia      | 894,800|  55,063 |    6.1   | 472,528|      8.5      |\r\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAmong the fourteen real slaveholding States of the Union Kentucky\r\nstood ninth in the number of slaves in 1850, but was third in the\r\nnumber of slave owners and with the exception of Missouri had less\r\nslaves for each owner than any other State.

He set a perfectly arbitrary\r\nvaluation of $400 on each slave, but, if one takes into account the\r\ninfants and the aged unable to work, his general appraisement of the\r\nslave group is fair enough for the time and for a basis of comparison.\r\nIt will be seen at a glance that after taking out the value of the\r\nslaves in all the States Kentucky was the richest southern\r\ncommonwealth.\r\n\r\nFrom the three preceding tables it is apparent that while the Kentucky\r\nslaveholders represented about 28 per cent of the white population of\r\nthe State, on the average they held less slaves than in the other\r\nSouthern States. Slave property in Kentucky was a much smaller part of\r\nthe wealth of the commonwealth than in the States to the south. The\r\nrelatively large number of holders is to be explained by the type of\r\nslavery which existed in the State. Many persons held a few servants\r\nin bondage and those who held many slaves were very few in number.\r\n\r\nThe question of the sale of slaves from Kentucky into the southern\r\nmarket presents a much more formidable problem. The chief charge that\r\nthe anti-slavery people made against Kentucky was that the State\r\nregularly bred and reared slaves for the market in the lower South.\r\nWhat was the attitude of the Kentucky slaveholder and the people in\r\ngeneral on the question of the domestic slave trade? There is no doubt\r\nthat in the later years of slavery there were sold in the State many\r\nslaves who ultimately found their way into the southern market\r\nnotwithstanding the contempt of the average Kentucky slaveholder for\r\nthe slave trade. This trend of opinion will be seen as we proceed. If\r\nthe sentiment was decidedly against such human commerce how did so\r\nmany slaves become victims of the slave trader?\r\n\r\nThere were five general causes which led to the sale of slaves in\r\nKentucky: (1) When they became so unruly that the master was forced to\r\nsell; (2) when their sale was necessary to settle an estate; (3) when\r\nthe master was reduced to the need of the money value in preference to\r\nthe labor; (4) when captured runaways were unclaimed after one year;\r\nand (5) when the profit alone was desired by unscrupulous masters.\r\nMany other reasons have been given, but a careful investigation of\r\nall available material confines practically every known case of sale\r\nto one of the above classifications. Mrs. Stowe in her _Key to Uncle\r\nTom's Cabin_[249] maintained that the prevalence of the slave trade in\r\nKentucky was due to the impoverishment of the soil beyond recovery and\r\nthe decrease in the economic value of the slave to its owner. This\r\nargument is fallacious, for the very blue-grass region which held most\r\nof the slaves is today the most fertile section of the State.\r\n\r\nAs long as a slave conducted himself in accordance with the spirit of\r\nthe slave code there was little chance of his owner selling him\r\nagainst his will. The president of the Constitutional Convention of\r\n1849 stated that in the interior of the State, where slaves were the\r\nmost numerous, very few Negroes were sold out of the State and that\r\nthey were mostly those whose bad and ungovernable disposition was such\r\nthat their owners could no longer control them[250]. A true picture of\r\nthe average master's attitude has been given us by Prof. N. S. Shaler.\r\n\"What negroes there were,\" said he, \"belonged to a good class. The\r\ngreater number of them were from families which had been owned by the\r\nancestors of their masters in Virginia. In my grandfather's household\r\nand those of his children there were some two dozen of these blacks.\r\nThey were well cared for; none of them were ever sold, though there\r\nwas the common threat that 'if you don't behave, you will be sold\r\nSouth.' One of the commonest bits of instruction my grandfather gave\r\nme was to remember that my people had in a century never bought or\r\nsold a slave except to keep families together. By that he meant that a\r\ngentleman of his station should not run any risk of appearing as a\r\n'negro trader,' the last word of opprobrium to be slung at a man. So\r\nfar as I can remember, this rule was well kept and social ostracism\r\nwas likely to be visited on any one who was fairly suspected of buying\r\nor selling slaves for profit. This state of opinion was, I believe,\r\nvery general among the better class of slave owners in Kentucky. When\r\nnegroes were sold it was because they were vicious and intractable.\r\nYet there were exceptions to this high-minded humor.\"[251]\r\n\r\nWhen a master had a bad Negro about the only thing that could be done\r\nfor the sake of discipline was to sell him. If the owner kept the\r\nslave, the latter would corrupt his fellows and if he were set free,\r\nthe master would reward where he ought to punish. The human interest\r\nwhich the owner took in his servant when the demands of the\r\ninstitution necessitated his sale is shown in the case of the Negro\r\nFrank, owned by A. Barnett, of Greensburg. Witness these words of the\r\nmaster in a runaway advertisement: \"His transgressions impelled me,\r\nsome years since to take him to New Orleans and sell him, where he\r\nbecame the property of a Spaniard, who branded him on each cheek thus,\r\n(B), which is plain to be seen when said negro is newly shaved. I went\r\nto New Orleans again last May, where, having my feelings excited by\r\nthe tale Frank told me, I purchased him again.\"[252] After the master\r\nhad gone to all this trouble in the interest of the slave the latter\r\nran away shortly after his return to Kentucky.\r\n\r\n     [Transcriber's Note: In the previous paragraph, (B) actually\r\n     appears as the letter B, rotated 90 degrees, counter-clockwise.]\r\n\r\nIt was often necessary to sell slaves in order to settle an estate. It\r\nwas seldom possible for a man to will his property in Negroes without\r\nsome divisions becoming necessary at the hands of the executor in the\r\njust interest of the heirs. These public auctions usually took place\r\non court day, at the courthouse door and were conducted by the master\r\ncommissioner of the circuit court. The following advertisement reveals\r\nthe necessity and the procedure:\r\n\r\n     SALE OF NEGROES\r\n\r\n     By virtue of a decree of the Fayette Circuit, the undersigned\r\n     will, as Commissioner to carry into effect said decree, sell to\r\n     the highest bidder, on the public square in the city of\r\n     Lexington, on Monday the 10th of March next, being county court\r\n     day, the following slaves, to wit:\r\n\r\n     Keiser, Carr, Sally, Bob, Susan, Sam, Sarah and Ben; belonging to\r\n     the estate of Alexander Culbertson, deceased. The sale to be on a\r\n     credit of three months, the purchaser to give bond with approved\r\n     security. The sale to take place between the hours of 11 o'clock\r\n     in the morning and 3 o'clock in the evening.\r\n\r\n     February 26, 1834         JOHN CLARK, _Commissioner_[253]\r\n\r\nOn the same day the sheriff of the county might appear at the\r\ncourthouse door in accordance with a previous announcement and auction\r\noff any unclaimed runaway that had been lodged in the county jail or\r\nhired out under his authority for a period of a year or more. The\r\nslaves thus sold were usually fugitives from the lower South who had\r\nbeen apprehended on their way to Ohio or Indiana. Although the utmost\r\npublicity would have been given to their capture, in accordance with\r\nthe law, few of the planters of the far South seem ever to have\r\nclaimed their property. The usual legal code in this matter is shown\r\nby the notice below:\r\n\r\n     NOTICE: Agreeably to an act of the General Assembly, passed\r\n     January 11, 1845, I will, on the first Monday of May, 1846,\r\n     before the Court House door, in the city of Louisville, sell to\r\n     the highest bidder, on a credit of six months, the purchaser\r\n     giving bond with good security, having the force and effect of a\r\n     replevin bond, JOHN, a runaway slave, 18 or 19 years of age, 5\r\n     feet 3 or 4 inches high, a rather heavy built, supposed to be the\r\n     property of Daniel McCaleb or Calip, residing on the coast some\r\n     twenty miles below New Orleans.\r\n\r\n                         F. S. J. RONALD _Deputy Sheriff_\r\n                  for JAMES HARRISON _Sheriff Jefferson Co_.[254]\r\n     Feb. 25, 1846.\r\n\r\nUnder the three causes of sale thus far cited the blame would not be\r\nplaced upon the master. In the case of the unruly Negro the owner was\r\naccording to the ethics of that day not at fault. In the settlement of\r\nan estate the slaveholder was no longer a factor, for his demise alone\r\nhad brought the sale. In the case of the runaway the owner was\r\nunknown. Mrs. Stowe probably showed the attitude of the average\r\nKentucky master when she pictured Uncle Tom as being sold for the\r\nsouthern market only because of the economic necessities of the owner.\r\nWhen in such a position the master felt called upon to explain the\r\nnecessities of the case. He was very careful not to be cast under the\r\nsuspicion of public opinion as a \"slave trader,\" which, as Shaler has\r\nsaid, was the \"last word of opprobrium.\" Witness a few instances in\r\nevidence:\r\n\r\n     NEGROES FOR SALE\r\n\r\n     A yellow negro woman of fine constitution, and two children, from\r\n     the country, and sold for no fault but to raise money.

They will not be sold separately, or to any\r\n     person wishing to take them out of the State. Enquire at this\r\n     office.[256]\r\n\r\nIn 1834 Thomas J. Allen, a citizen of Louisville, desired to exchange\r\nhis property in the city for 40 or 50 slaves, but he specifically\r\nstated that they were to be for his own use and that he wanted them to\r\nbe \"in families.\"[257] The same attitude appears in the case of a\r\nhouse servant for sale with the reasons for such specifically stated:\r\n\r\n     FOR SALE\r\n\r\n     I wish to sell a negro woman, who has been accustomed to house\r\n     work. She is an excellent cook, washes and scours, and is in\r\n     every respect, an active and intelligent servant. I do not\r\n     require her services, which is my only reason for wishing to\r\n     dispose of her.\r\n\r\n                                   MASLIN SMITH[258]\r\n\r\nThe prevalence of statements giving the reasons for and the\r\nrestrictions upon these sales should show beyond any reasonable doubt\r\nthat public opinion would not tolerate any suspicion of a heartless\r\ntraffic in slaves. These sentiments were especially prevalent in the\r\ncentral portion of the State. The only case known to the writer where\r\na large number of slaves were sold without any qualification was near\r\nHarrodsburg in August, 1845; but in this instance all the man's\r\nproperty, including 450 acres of land, was sold at the same time.[259]\r\n\r\nThere were, naturally, some unscrupulous masters who cared little for\r\nthe fate of their slaves when sold. They placed no restrictions upon\r\nthe sale, either in destination or in the break-up of family ties. We\r\nwill cite only two, one for the earlier and one for the later period,\r\nnoticeable chiefly for the lack of regard for Negro family life.\r\n\r\n     NEGROES FOR SALE\r\n\r\n     The subscriber has for sale a negro man and woman, each about 24\r\n     years of age, both are excellent plantation hands, together with\r\n     two children. They will be sold separately or altogether.\r\n\r\n                                   LUIDORES LUCAS[260]\r\n\r\n     FOR SALE\r\n\r\n     I wish to sell a negro woman and four children. The woman is 22\r\n     years old, of good character, a good cook and washer. The\r\n     children are very likely, from 6 years down to 1-1/2. I will sell\r\n     them together or separately to suit purchasers.\r\n\r\n                                   J. T. UNDERWOOD.[261]\r\n\r\nThe aggregate of all these causes was sufficient to bring about a\r\nsupply for the southern market. The question now arises as to how the\r\ndemand was met commercially. To what extent were there slave traders\r\nin Kentucky? George Prentice, the famous editor of the _Louisville\r\nJournal_, himself a loyal exponent of slavery, early pointed out that\r\nKentucky had an ample supply of Negroes and that they were being sent\r\nsouth in large numbers. He further stated that any one who wanted\r\nslaves could always purchase them by leaving an order in\r\nLouisville.[262] This opinion was expressed at a time when the\r\nnon-importation act of 1833 had been in force for sixteen years, which\r\nmeant that Kentucky was producing slaves faster than she needed them.\r\nIt was only two months after this that Richard Henry Collins in an\r\neditorial in the _Maysville Eagle_ gave a flagrant example of a slave\r\ntrader in Kentucky who violated the spirit as well as the letter of\r\nthe law. But the sentiment of the people on the slave dealer had been\r\nexpressed much earlier. In 1833 a Lexington editor felt exasperated\r\nbecause of the appearance of a large group of slaves in the streets of\r\nthe city on their way to be sold south. When another trader appeared\r\nwith his Negro slaves held together with a chain he voiced his wrath\r\nin this fashion:\r\n\r\n     \"A few weeks ago we gave an account of a company of men, women\r\n     and children, part of them manacled, passing through the streets.\r\n     Last week, a number of slaves were driven through the main street\r\n     of our city, among them were a number manacled together, two\r\n     abreast, all connected by, and supporting, a heavy iron chain,\r\n     which extended the whole length of the line.\"[263]\r\n\r\nAbout the same time a citizen of Danville sold a Negro woman to a\r\nregular slave trader. The news spread around the town rapidly and to\r\nsave himself from the threats of the gathering mob the owner was\r\ncompelled for his own safety to follow the slave dealer and repurchase\r\nthe woman at a decided increase in price.[264]\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to find out how many slave dealers there were in\r\nthe State, for few of them ever came out in the open and advertised\r\ntheir trade. As would be expected from its size and situation\r\nLouisville was the place where the dealer could ply his trade to the\r\nbest advantage. It was the central business point and the port from\r\nwhich most slaves from Kentucky were shipped down the Ohio and\r\nMississippi. There is no mention in the newspapers of any dealers\r\nthere before the year 1845. Thereafter there were several who\r\nadvertised for any number of slaves and made no secret of the purpose\r\nof purchase. In the _Journal_ for October 29, 1845, William Kelly\r\ncalled for all persons who had slaves to sell to see him and offered\r\nthem the highest prices. He further stated that he had slaves for\r\nsale. His name does not often appear in succeeding years. During the\r\nnext decade there were four regular dealers who apparently did\r\nconsiderable business: T. Arterburn, J. Arterburn, William F. Talbott,\r\nand Thomas Powell. Later John Mattingly came upon the scene presumably\r\nfrom St. Louis. In July, 1845, the Arterburn brothers began a series\r\nof advertisements which ran for several years. \"We wish to purchase\r\n100 negroes for the Southern market, for which we will pay the highest\r\nprices in cash.\"[265] Talbott began his publicity in 1848 with these\r\nwords: \"The subscriber wishes to purchase 100 negroes, for which he\r\nwill pay the highest cash prices. Can always be found at the\r\nLouisville Hotel.\"[266] Two years later he was still advertising, but\r\nhad ceased placing any limit on the number to be bought and had moved\r\nhis quarters to the Hotel O'Rain.[267] Thomas Powell also began in\r\n1848 with this stock phraseology--\"Persons having negroes for sale can\r\nfind a purchaser at the highest cash prices by calling on the\r\nsubscriber, on Sixth Street, between Main and Market, adjoining H.\r\nDuncan's stable.\"[268] This advertisement ran continually for a\r\nperiod of two years. John Mattingly evidently came from Missouri in\r\nthe same year, and remained until 1852, when he returned to St. Louis\r\nto ply his trade.[269] While he was in Louisville he ran an\r\nadvertisement in the _Journal_ after this fashion: \"The undersigned\r\nwishes to purchase 100 negroes both men and women, for which he will\r\npay the highest cash prices. Those who have negroes for sale would do\r\nwell to call on him at the Gait House.\"[270]\r\n\r\nIt is noticeable that none of the Louisville directories for this\r\nperiod mention any slave dealers. This failure may have been due\r\nmerely to the fact that there were so few traders in the city and that\r\nthey were more or less transient residents. On the other hand, public\r\nopinion apparently never acknowledged that there were any real\r\ncitizens of the city engaged in the slave trade. Beginning in 1840 the\r\n_Louisville Journal_ published a weekly paper called _Louisville\r\nPrices Current_. In 1855 this was succeeded by the _Commercial Review\r\nand Louisville Prices Current_, which was published by the Louisville\r\nChamber of Commerce. These two papers devoted themselves exclusively\r\nto the commercial transactions of the city and gave price quotations\r\nweekly for every conceivable kind of goods in the market together with\r\nthe volume of sales. Strange to say, there has not been found a single\r\nissue of either of these papers, which mentions the selling price of\r\nslaves or any transaction in Negroes. If there was a trade in slaves\r\nwhich was regarded purely as a commercial enterprise, as some would\r\nhave us think, then it is very hard to understand why these splendid\r\ntrade papers did not contain any account of the business.\r\n\r\nThere were some Louisville business men who bought and sold slaves as\r\nonly one of the branches of their commercial activities. This would\r\naccount to some extent for the failure to list traders in the local\r\ndirectories for it is noticeable that such men never called themselves\r\nslave dealers. As early as the year 1825 John Stickney established\r\nthe _Louisville Intelligence Office_ on Main Street, which was a sort\r\nof labor and real estate exchange. He advertised that he sold books;\r\nhad money to loan; houses for rent and sale; horses and Negroes for\r\nsale and hire; carriages for sale; conducted a labor exchange, and\r\nrecommended the best boarding houses.[271] A year later J. C. Gentry\r\nopened the \"Western Horse Market\" at the corner of Market and Fourth\r\nStreets. He advertised that he conducted a livery stable, and also\r\nsold on commission, at public or private sale, horses, carriages,\r\ncattle, wagons and slaves; and that he would conduct an auction on\r\nWednesdays and Saturdays.[272] A similar case was that of A. C. Scott,\r\nwho in 1854 opened a real estate and land office but who stated in the\r\npress that he not only bought and sold land and rented houses but that\r\nhe would sell and hire slaves.[273] Consequently Scott was listed as a\r\nreal estate and land agent in the local directories. It is impossible\r\nto determine how many of these occasional slave dealers there were,\r\nbut in so far as available material shows these three were the only\r\nones to announce their trade publicly.\r\n\r\nIt would appear from all the evidence at hand that while Kentucky\r\nfurnished many slaves for the southern market there was no general\r\ninternal slave trade, as a commercial enterprise. There were in\r\nLouisville, however, a few heartless business men who took advantage\r\nof the decreasing value of slave labor in Kentucky and the rising\r\nprices of slaves in the far South. In this respect, Kentucky became a\r\nfield of supply for the slave markets of the lower South.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there are no statistics available by which the number of\r\nslaves sent south can be computed. The most comprehensive anti-slavery\r\npublication on the internal slave trade was unable to decide with\r\ncertainty what proportion of slaves for the southern market was\r\nfurnished by each of the so-called breeding States. The author of\r\n_Slavery and Internal Slave Trade in the United States_ estimated\r\nthat 80,000 slaves were annually exported from seven States to the\r\nSouth. He gave no figures that were not his own estimates. He ranked\r\nthe seven States, however, in the order of the number of slaves which\r\nhe thought they furnished as follows: Virginia, Maryland, North\r\nCarolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri and Delaware.[274]\r\n\r\nMartin estimates that Kentucky sent on the average about 5,000 slaves\r\nto the southern market.[275] Again this must be considered purely\r\nconjectural. It is reasonable to suppose that during the last two\r\ndecades of the slavery era there were few slaves imported into\r\nKentucky that were intended for the purely Kentucky market. What\r\nNegroes came into Kentucky were for the most part on their way to the\r\nmore profitable southern trade. The average death rate among the\r\nslaves during this period was 1.9 per one hundred and the birth rate\r\nwas 3.2, or an excess of births over deaths of 1.1 per hundred. This\r\nwould make the annual natural increase among the slave population\r\nabout 2,000 per year. Comparing this with the growth of the slave\r\ngroup from 1840 to 1850 we find that the increase of slaves was much\r\nmore. But it was during the next decade that the slave trade reached\r\nits height and here we find that the slave population increased\r\n14,502, whereas the natural increase during that period should have\r\nbeen 23,190. Hence the slaves failed to reach even their natural\r\nincrease by a deficiency of 8,688. Taken literally that would mean\r\nthat during the ten-year period that number of slaves were exported\r\nfrom Kentucky. But it is reasonable to suppose that many more than\r\nthat were sent to the South. With the exception of the last decade,\r\nhowever, the slave population of Kentucky increased faster than the\r\nmere natural increase of the Negroes. The law would not permit of any\r\nimportation of slaves intended for Kentucky, so the export of purely\r\nKentucky slaves appears never to have been prominent except during the\r\ndecade from 1850 to 1860.\r\n\r\nThe selling price of slaves naturally presents itself at this point.\r\nIn Kentucky these records are very few because the tax books in\r\npractically all the counties of the State have been destroyed. We have\r\nno accurate statements extant before about the year 1855. The prices\r\nwhich we have obtained are quotations from the auction of slaves of\r\nestates to settle the interests of the heirs. On January court day, in\r\n1855, there were sold in the settlement of estates in Bourbon,\r\nFayette, Clark and Franklin Counties Negro men who brought $1,260,\r\n$1,175, $1,070, $1,378, $1,295, $1,015 and $1,505.[276] The county\r\ncommissioner of Harrison auctioned the slaves of the deceased George\r\nKirkpatrick with the following prices received:\r\n\r\n     America     40 years of age  }\r\n     Peggy        6 years of age  } all for $1,600\r\n     Eliza        4 years of age  }\r\n     Brown        6 months of age }\r\n\r\n     Peter       23 years  of age      $1,290\r\n     Emanuel     24 years  of age         750\r\n     Tom         16 years  of age       1,015\r\n     Ann         14 years  of age         775\r\n     Emma        12 years  of age         865\r\n     Sarah       26 years  of age         350[277]\r\n\r\nThe county commissioner at Henderson received the following prices for\r\nslaves in the settlement of several estates on January 28, 1858:[278]\r\n\r\n     Ruth          33 years of age        $   800\r\n     Willis        59 years of age            475\r\n     George        35 years of age          1,200\r\n     Delphy        80 years of age             75\r\n     Leila         65 years of age            282\r\n     Clarissa      24 years of age          1,131\r\n     Andrew        19 years of age          1,500\r\n     Susan         17 years of age            470\r\n     Jennie        17 years of age          1,100\r\n     Cupid         85 years of age             74\r\n     Eliza         32 years of age            500\r\n     Bell          41 years of age          1,000\r\n\r\nThis sale is most significant for the cases of \"Delphy,\" 80 years old,\r\nand \"Cupid,\" 85 years of age. It is difficult to account for such a\r\nsale in any discussion of the slave trade, but it does show the\r\nhumanitarian side of Kentucky slavery. Negroes at such an age had no\r\neconomic value even if they were given away, because the expense of\r\ntheir maintenance was more than the value of any possible labor they\r\ncould perform.\r\n\r\nAt Georgetown in December of the same year we have this record:[279]\r\n\r\n     Griffin      45 years of age     $  640\r\n     Mary         14 years of age      1,060\r\n     Ellen        12 years of age        800\r\n     Elizabeth    11 years of age        406 (one-eyed)\r\n     Sanford       9 years of age        700\r\n     Arabel       10 years of age        690\r\n     Adam         41 years of age        700\r\n     Bettie        3 years of age        260\r\n     Aaron        28 years of age      1,191\r\n     Sam          25 years of age      1,350\r\n\r\nThe auction of the slaves of the estate of Spencer C. Graves at\r\nLexington in April, 1859, brought these prices:[280]\r\n\r\n     John       18 years of age                 $1,500\r\n     Dick       21 years of age                  1,400\r\n     Jerry      38 years of age                    700\r\n     Major      50 years of age                    480\r\n     Charles    31 years of age                  1,155\r\n     John Jr    18 years of age                  1,140\r\n     Billy      31 years of age                  1,100\r\n     Isabella   40 years, with 3 children, ages\r\n                   11, 5 and 2                   1,610\r\n     Rebecca    30 years, with 3 children, ages\r\n                   11, 6 and 4                   2,410\r\n     Lucy       18 years of age, with infant     1,280\r\n     Davidella  31 years of age                  1,220\r\n     Mary Ann   31 years of age                    835\r\n     Patience   18 years of age                  1,350\r\n     Catharine  15 years of age                  1,130\r\n\r\nSuch a series of prices would show beyond a reasonable doubt that the\r\nvalue of slaves was determined entirely by the increasing demand for\r\nslaves in the lower South and was in no way an indication of the value\r\nof slave labor within Kentucky. As was pointed out earlier in this\r\nchapter, the labor value of an agricultural slave in the State\r\nsteadily decreased after about the year 1830.\r\n\r\nWas slavery profitable to the Kentucky planters? In the many debates\r\non the slavery question which took place after 1830 no one ever stood\r\nout in the affirmative. The only ones to discuss the economic side of\r\nthe issue were those in opposition to slavery. As has often been said\r\nof the Kentucky situation, \"the program was to use negroes to raise\r\ncorn to feed hogs to feed negroes, who raised more corn to feed more\r\nhogs.\" Tobacco was the largest crop raised in the State and corn came\r\nnext. Neither proved to be peculiarly adapted to slave labor. There\r\nwere few large plantations in the State where it could be made\r\nadvantageous. What Negro work there was to be done was never confined\r\nto any particular kind of cultivation but was used in the manner of\r\nfarm labor today in the State. Squire Turner, of Madison County, in\r\nthe Constitutional Convention of 1849 made a careful summary of the\r\nexisting economic problems of slavery. \"There are,\" said he, \"about\r\n$61,000,000 worth of slave property in the state which produces less\r\nthan three per cent profit on the capital invested, or about half as\r\nmuch as the moneyed capital would yield. There are about 200,000\r\nslaves in Kentucky. Of these about seventy-five per cent are\r\nsuperannuated, sick, women in unfit condition for labor, and infants\r\nunable to work, who yield no profit. Show me a man that has forty or\r\nfifty slaves on his estate, and if there are ten out of that number\r\nwho are available and valuable, it is as much as you can expect. But\r\nmy calculation allows you to have seventy-five per cent who are barely\r\nable to maintain themselves, to pay for their own clothing, fuel,\r\nhouse room and doctor's bills. Is there any gentleman who has a large\r\nnumber of slaves, who will say that they are any more profitable than\r\nthat?\"[281]\r\n\r\nNo one in the convention answered the last question put by Squire\r\nTurner. But regardless of such an economic condition, not a single\r\npiece of remedial legislation was passed and the members of the\r\nConstitutional Convention added a provision to the Bill of Rights\r\nwhich rooted the slavery system firmer than ever. That most admirable\r\nof all southern characters, and at the same time the most difficult to\r\nunderstand, the Kentucky master, took little heed of a question of\r\ndollars and cents when it interfered with his moral and humanitarian\r\nsentiments. He had inherited, in most cases, the slaves that were his.\r\nHe knew well enough that the system did not pay but supposing that he\r\nshould turn his slaves loose, what would become of them? What could\r\nthey do for a living? The experience of later years proved that his\r\napparently obstinate temperament was mixed with a good deal of wisdom,\r\nfor once the slaves were set free their status was not to any great\r\nextent ameliorated if they went abroad from the plantation where they\r\nhad lived from childhood.\r\n\r\nThere was a certain amount of profit in the labor of able-bodied\r\nslaves but they only represented a fraction of the Negroes whom the\r\nmaster was called upon to support. The law compelled the owner to\r\nmaintain his old and helpless slaves and this represented the spirit\r\nof the large majority of the slaveholders. Those were rare cases\r\nindeed when an owner was hailed into court for failing to provide for\r\nan infirm member of his slave household. The true Kentuckian never\r\nbegrudged the expense that such support incurred. One of the ablest\r\nlawyers of the State, Benjamin Hardin, made the statement that \"if it\r\nwere not for supporting my slaves, I would never go near a\r\ncourthouse.\"[282]\r\n\r\nRev. Stuart Robinson, speaking before the Kentucky Colonization\r\nSociety in 1849, gave another viewpoint of the economic value of the\r\nslave. \"The increase of slaves in Kentucky,\" said he, \"has hardly\r\nreached three thousand annually for eighteen years past. The increase\r\nsince 1840 has been 27,653--the increase for the year just closed\r\n2,921. In twenty-six counties, embracing one fourth of the slave\r\npopulation--some of them the largest slave-holding counties--there has\r\nbeen an actual decrease in the last year of 881 slaves. In twelve\r\nother counties the increase has been only twenty-three. There are ten\r\ncounties in the State, which contain one third of all the slave\r\npopulation of Kentucky; in these ten counties, the increase of slaves\r\nfor five years past has been 2,728--an increase of less than one per\r\ncent per annum. Nor is this slow increase of slavery to be attributed\r\nto any stagnation or decline of public prosperity, for in the meantime\r\nthe state has been growing in population and wealth as heretofore.\r\nDuring these five years the taxable property of the Commonwealth has\r\nincreased in value more than seventy-six millions. Now this decrease\r\nof slaves while the other property of the commonwealth is increasing\r\nmust arise from one of three causes--and in either case the inference\r\nis the same as to the fate of slavery in Kentucky. (1) Is it because\r\nthe climate is unhealthy to the African? If so then African labor\r\ncannot continue. (2) Is it owing to emigration? Then something is\r\nwrong in the system of labor, that causes the emigration of our\r\npeople--for no finer soil--no more desirable residence can be found in\r\nthe world. (3) Or is it owing to the domestic slave trade? Then for\r\nsome reason slave labor is less profitable here than elsewhere, and\r\nmust soon be given up.\"[283]\r\n\r\nThese figures quoted by the speaker on the slave population for year\r\nby year are available in the auditor's tax books for the years 1840 to\r\n1859:[284]\r\n\r\n     1840      164,817\r\n     1841      168,853\r\n     1842      171,035\r\n     1843      176,107\r\n     1844      178,837\r\n     1845      182,742\r\n     1846      185,582\r\n     1847      189,549\r\n     1848      192,470\r\n     1849      195,110\r\n     1850      196,847\r\n     1851      196,336\r\n     1852      200,867\r\n     1853      200,015\r\n     1854      200,181\r\n     1855      202,790\r\n     1856      201,160\r\n     1857      201,590\r\n     1858      207,559\r\n     1859      208,625\r\n\r\nThe very small growth shown here would barely account for the natural\r\nincrease among the slaves by virtue of the high birth rate. The\r\nmortality rates were about the same for slaves as for whites. The\r\nrelative decline was undoubtedly due to the rising prices for slaves\r\nwhich were sent to the South and the consequent decreasing value of a\r\nslave's labor to the Kentuckian. He knew beyond a doubt that the time\r\nwould eventually come when he would have to part with his slave and\r\nthat portion of the holders who were not averse to selling their\r\nchattels did so during this period.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[234] Hening's Statutes, Vol. X, p. 50.\r\n\r\n[235] Hening's Statutes, Vol. XI, p. 309; Treat, P.

Of the\r\n293,427 slaves which were held in the State of Virginia in the year\r\n1790, however, only 11,830 were in the district of Kentucky, which at\r\nthat time had a total population of 73,077. Few thought, however, of\r\ndisputing the rights of the institution in the newly created State.\r\nThe final convention which met to form a constitution was held at\r\nDanville, beginning on April 2, 1792, and in the course of its\r\nproceedings it was apparent that there was no fundamental division\r\namong the delegates regarding any of the proposed provisions with the\r\nexception of the one dealing with slavery. Virginia had stipulated in\r\ngiving permission for the formation of the new State that slavery as\r\nan established institution should not be disturbed, and this policy\r\nhad the support of a majority of the members of the constitutional\r\nconvention. George Nichols, a native of the Old Dominion, was the\r\nleader of the assembly and had charge of most of the work which was\r\ndone and naturally was most interested in carrying out the wishes of\r\nhis native State in the formation of the new document. The only\r\nserious opponent was David Rice, a noted Presbyterian minister, but,\r\nhaving resigned on April 11, he was not present at the time when the\r\nslavery issue came up for final settlement.\r\n\r\nA separate vote was taken on Article IX, the slavery section, which\r\npassed 26 to 19. It was finally provided that\r\n\r\n     The legislature shall have no power to pass laws for the\r\n     emancipation of slaves without the consent of their owners, or\r\n     without paying their owners, previous to such emancipation, a\r\n     full equivalent in money, for the slaves emancipated; they shall\r\n     have no power to prevent immigrants to this state, from bringing\r\n     with them such persons as are deemed slaves by the laws of any\r\n     one of the United States, so long as any person of the same age\r\n     or description shall be continued in slavery by the laws of this\r\n     state: that they shall pass laws to permit the owners of slaves\r\n     to emancipate them, saving the rights of creditors, and\r\n     preventing them from becoming a charge to the county in which\r\n     they reside; they shall have full power to prevent slaves from\r\n     being brought into this state as merchandise; they shall have\r\n     full power to prevent any slave being brought into this state\r\n     from a foreign country, and to prevent those from being brought\r\n     into this state, who have been since the first of January, 1789,\r\n     or may hereafter be imported into any of the United States from a\r\n     foreign country. And they shall have full power to pass such laws\r\n     as may be necessary to oblige the owners of slaves to treat them\r\n     with humanity, to provide for them necessary clothes and\r\n     provisions, to abstain from all injuries to them extending to\r\n     life or limb, and in case of their neglect or refusal to comply\r\n     with the directions of such laws, to have such slave or slaves\r\n     sold for the benefit of their owner or owners.[285]\r\n\r\nIn any discussion of the slavery question in Kentucky in its\r\nhistorical aspects this article of the first constitution is\r\nfundamental. It is evident that even at that early day the difficulty\r\nof the slavery problem was already in the minds of the people in spite\r\nof many other apparently more pressing issues. The article itself\r\nremained practically intact throughout the existence of slavery in the\r\nState. Were there ever in later years gathered within the confines of\r\nthe State any body of men who had a better grasp of the future? The\r\nsingle instance of the recommendation that the legislature should pass\r\nlaws permitting the emancipation of slaves only under the provision\r\nthat they should be guaranteed from becoming a public charge to the\r\ncounty shows the comprehension of a difficulty that could not at such\r\nan early date have developed to any great degree, but which in later\r\ndecades was a formidable problem. We may well say with John Mason\r\nBrown, however, that \"the system of slavery thus contemplated was\r\ndesigned to be as mild, as human, and as much protected from traffic\r\nevils as possible, but it was to be emphatically perpetual, for no\r\nemancipation could be had without the assent of each particular owner\r\nof each individual slave.\"[286]\r\n\r\nThe session of the State assembly which met in November, 1792, only\r\nattempted to carry out the constitutional provision prohibiting\r\ncommercial transactions with slaves. No person was permitted to buy\r\nof, or sell to, any slave, any manner of thing whatsoever without a\r\nwritten permit descriptive of the article under the penalty of four\r\ntimes the value of the thing bought or sold. The jurisdiction of such\r\ncases was given to the county court, if they concerned values of more\r\nthan five pounds. The slave was to receive ten lashes, which by the\r\nstandards of those days was a meager punishment for any offense.[287]\r\nWhenever possible the slave was not brought into consideration as an\r\noffender. The theory seems to have been that the slave was better off\r\nwhen left alone. It was only when some unscrupulous outsider came in\r\nto use the slave either as a victim or as an object of profit that it\r\nwas necessary to draw the strings tighter on the Negro, not because of\r\nany inherent tendency to crime so much as to keep the slave from\r\nbecoming unruly when in the power of a superior influence.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the session of 1798 that the legislature drew up the\r\nfundamental slave code which was to carry out all the recommendations\r\nof the constitutional convention and which remained the basis of all\r\nlegal action throughout the entire period of slavery. Among the early\r\nacts of the State had been the temporary adoption of the statutes of\r\nVirginia on the treatment of slaves and slavery problems, which were\r\nthen in force.[288] These remained as a slave code for Kentucky until\r\nthe enactment in 1798 of these new laws, which contained forty-three\r\narticles and involved almost every question that could come up for\r\nlegal consideration in connection with the institution. The experience\r\nof six years as a separate State had served to show that many\r\nexisting provisions of the Virginia code were not readily adapted to\r\nthe rapidly growing State, and then too there was a decided tendency\r\nto ameliorate the condition of the slave as much as possible. In\r\nKentucky they were not then, at least, confronted with such a large\r\nmass of slaves that they could not meet problems in a much easier\r\nmanner than in the Old Dominion.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, it was naturally found necessary to place some\r\nrestrictions on the slave and his movements. He was not allowed to\r\nleave his master's plantation without written permission and if he did\r\ngo away, any person could apprehend the offender and take him before a\r\njustice of the peace, who was empowered to order the infliction of\r\nstripes at his discretion. Furthermore, he was not to wander off to\r\nany other plantation without the written permission of his owner, with\r\nthe provision in this instance that he was not to be taken before a\r\njustice of the peace, but before his owner, who was entitled to\r\ninflict ten lashes upon the offender. Should the slave be found\r\ncarrying any powder, shot, a gun, club, or any weapon he could be\r\napprehended by any free person and taken before a justice and a much\r\nseverer penalty exacted in the form of thirty-nine lashes, \"well laid\r\non, on the bare back.\"[289] It is clear that this law was drawn up to\r\nkeep the slave from becoming a public menace and not as a sign of\r\nabsolute restriction on the servant, for it was further provided in\r\nSection 6 that in case the slave lived in a frontier community he\r\ncould go to the local justice of the peace and secure a permit to keep\r\nand use guns, powder, shot and other weapons for either offensive or\r\ndefensive purposes. This permission was to be indorsed by any free\r\nNegro, mulatto or Indian and did not necessarily involve the approval\r\nof the owner of the slave.\r\n\r\nIt was declared unlawful for slaves to engage in riots, unlawful\r\nassemblies, in trespasses or in seditious speech and, if so accused,\r\nthey were to be taken before the local justice who was to punish them\r\nat his discretion. But the Negroes themselves were not to be\r\nconsidered as the only guilty ones. In order to prevent any such\r\ndisorderly meetings no owner of slaves was to be allowed to permit any\r\nslave not belonging to him to remain on his plantation for more than\r\nfour hours at any one time under a nominal penalty to such owner of\r\n$2; but, if he allowed more than five such slaves to assemble on his\r\nproperty, he was to be fined more severely. If such a group were\r\nbrought together by the written permission of the owner and for\r\nbusiness reasons, however, there was involved no offense\r\nwhatever.[290] It was realized that oftentimes the chief leaders in\r\nthe unlawful meetings of slaves were free Negroes and sympathetic\r\nwhites. Were any such to be found present they were to be arrested and\r\nif found guilty when tried before a justice of the peace, should be\r\nfined 15 shillings, to be paid, not to the court, but to the informer\r\nand if the money was not forthcoming the court was to have twenty\r\nlashes inflicted--no matter whether the convicted be white or black.\r\nInasmuch as the degree of punishment of the slaves for being present\r\nat such a meeting was not specified it would seem that the legislature\r\nmeant that the free persons involved should be treated more severely\r\nthan slaves by the court.\r\n\r\nThe law of 1792 regarding trading with slaves had not proved to be\r\neffective, for in many cases the owner for a stipulated wage paid by\r\nthe slave had permitted him to go at large and engage in trade as if\r\nhe were a free man. The legislature found that this encouraged the\r\nslaves to commit thefts and engage in various evil practices and\r\nnaturally censured the owner. A fine of $50 was to be paid by the\r\nmaster for each offending slave and no punishment whatever was to be\r\ngiven the latter. But should the servant go so far as to hire himself\r\nout, he would be imprisoned by order of the court and, at the next\r\nsession of the county court, he would be sold. One fourth of the money\r\nthus received was to be applied to the county funds and 5 per cent was\r\nto be given to the sheriff and the owner was to receive the remaining\r\n70 per cent. Here too the slave was not punished and his condition of\r\nservitude was not changed. It was merely a change of owners. Again the\r\noffending owner was the victim and for his carelessness he was\r\ndeprived of 30 per cent of the money value of his slave.[291]\r\n\r\nThe leading Kentucky case bearing on slaves engaged in trade is that\r\nof Bryant _vs._ Sheely (5 Dana, 530). Five of the main points are\r\nworth mentioning here:\r\n\r\n     1. To buy or receive any article from a slave, without the\r\n     consent of his master, in writing, specifying the article, is a\r\n     highly penal offense.\r\n\r\n     2. A sale made by a slave, without such written consent, is void,\r\n     and does not divest the master of his property; he may sue for,\r\n     and recover it; or he may waive his right to the specific thing,\r\n     affirm the sale, and recover the price or value, if it was not\r\n     paid to the slave.\r\n\r\n     3. A general permission to a slave to go at large and trade for\r\n     himself as a free man, is contrary to public policy, and a\r\n     violation of a penal statute. The owner or master of a slave\r\n     could maintain no action for any claim acquired by a slave while\r\n     acting under such illegal license.\r\n\r\n     4. But a slave may be permitted by his master to buy or sell\r\n     particular articles, and any form of consent or permission given\r\n     by the master, or his assent after the fact, will give validity\r\n     to the sale--though the purchaser may be liable to the penalty,\r\n     if the consent be not in writing.\r\n\r\n     5. A slave, being authorized by his master to sell any particular\r\n     thing, becomes the agent of his master for that purpose; and from\r\n     the authority to sell, an authority to transfer the property, and\r\n     to fix and receive the price must be inferred; but the slave\r\n     cannot exercise or receive an authority to maintain any action in\r\n     relation to it; the right of action for the price belongs to the\r\n     master, and if he sues, that fact itself is sufficient evidence\r\n     that he authorized or approved and confirmed the sale.\r\n\r\nUnlike the more southerly States, Kentucky did not leave the slave\r\nhelpless in the courts. If a slave were charged with a capital crime\r\nhe was brought before the court of quarter sessions, which was\r\ncomposed of the various county justices of the peace. They were to\r\nconstitute a court of oyer and terminer. But they alone were not to\r\ndecide the fate of the Negro, for the sheriff was required to empanel\r\na jury of twelve men from among the bystanders, who were to constitute\r\nthe trial jury. It was explicitly stated that legal evidence in such a\r\ncase would be the confession of the offender, the oath of one or more\r\ncredible witnesses, or such testimony of Negroes, mulattoes, or\r\nIndians as should seem convincing to the court. When a slave was\r\ncalled upon to testify in such a case, the court, the witness \"not\r\nbeing a Christian,\" found it necessary to administer the following\r\ncharge that he might be under the greater obligation to declare the\r\ntruth: \"You are brought hither as a witness, and by the direction of\r\nthe law I am to tell you, before you give your evidence, that you must\r\ntell the truth and nothing but the truth, and that if it be found\r\nhereafter that you tell a lie, and give false testimony in this\r\nmatter, you must, for so doing, receive thirty-nine lashes on your\r\nbare back, well laid on, at the common whipping post.\"[292]\r\n\r\nSection 22 of the law of 1798 provided that the master or owner of any\r\nslave might appear in court at a trial of his servant and \"make what\r\njust defense he can for such slave.\" The only restriction was that\r\nsuch defense should not interfere with the form of the trial.\r\nNaturally the liberally disposed slaveholders interpreted this to mean\r\nthat they could employ counsel to defend their Negroes and it remained\r\na disputed question down to 1806, when the legislature made the\r\nprovisions more specific. By this new law it was provided that it was\r\nnot only the privilege but the duty of the owner of a slave who was\r\nbeing prosecuted to employ an attorney to defend him. The owner\r\nneglecting to do so the court must assign counsel to defend the slave\r\nand the costs thereby incurred were to be charged to the owner. The\r\nfee for defense was not to exceed $200 and if not forthcoming the\r\ncourt was empowered to recover the amount in the manner of any other\r\ndebt of similar amount. It was plainly the intention of the\r\nlegislature to provide a just trial for any slave, for they even went\r\nso far as to enact that the lawyer appointed by the court for the\r\nprisoner should \"defend such slave as in cases of free persons\r\nprosecuted for felony by the laws of this state.\"[293]\r\n\r\nWhen the slave was convicted of an offense which was punishable by\r\ndeath but which was within the benefit of clergy the capital penalty\r\nwas not pronounced, but the offender was burnt in the hand or\r\ninflicted with any other corporal penalty at the discretion of the\r\ncourt. Should the criminal be sentenced to suffer death, thirty days\r\nwere to elapse before the execution, except where it was a case of\r\nconspiracy, insurrection or rebellion. When the court had decided to\r\nsentence the slave to the death penalty a valuation of the Negro was\r\nmade. This statement was to be turned over to the State auditor of\r\npublic accounts who was required to issue a warrant on the treasury\r\nfor the amount in favor of the owner of the convicted party. The owner\r\non his part was to turn over to the treasurer the certificate of the\r\nclerk of the court showing that the slave had been condemned and the\r\nstatement of the sheriff that the offender had been executed or had\r\ndied before execution.[294]\r\n\r\nThis matter of the payment to the owner of the value of the executed\r\nslave appears never to have been questioned to any extent even by the\r\nabolitionists in the legislature until the session of 1830 when a bill\r\nwas introduced for the repeal of the law. The bill was lost but in the\r\ncourse of the debate it was stated that while Kentucky contained over\r\n160,000 slaves only about one fifth of the tax-paying whites were\r\nslaveholders and that $68,000 had already been paid out of the State\r\ntreasury as indemnity for slaves executed. After the defeat of this\r\nbill there was offered a substitute which proposed that a tax of one\r\nfourth of one per cent should be levied upon the value of all slaves\r\nin the State for the creation of a fund out of which to make such\r\ndisbursements, but this was likewise lost.[295]\r\n\r\nUntil 1811 there were no special enactments on slave crimes and their\r\npunishments. The court had, therefore, more or less range in the\r\nexactment of penalties but the legislature of 1811 passed during the\r\nfirst fortnight of its session a specific law governing slave crimes.\r\nOnly four offenses were to be regarded as punishable by death: (1)\r\nconspiracy and rebellion, (2) administering poison with intent to\r\nkill, (3) voluntary manslaughter and (4) rape of a white woman. If any\r\nslaves were to be found guilty of consulting or advising the murder of\r\nany one, every such consultation was to constitute an offense and be\r\npunishable by any number of stripes not exceeding one hundred.[296]\r\n\r\nAs time went on the list of capital crimes was increased as a natural\r\nresult of the growth of the slave population and their growing state\r\nof unrest after the incoming of the anti-slavery propaganda. By the\r\nclose of the slavery era in Kentucky there were eleven offenses for\r\nwhich slaves should suffer death: (1) murder, (2) arson, (3) rape of a\r\nwhite woman, (4) robbery, (5) burglary, (6) conspiracy, (7)\r\nadministering poison with intent to kill, (8) manslaughter, (9)\r\nattempting to commit rape on a white woman, (10) shooting at a white\r\nperson with intent to kill, and (11) wounding a white person with\r\nintent to kill. It will readily be seen that from a practical\r\nstandpoint these eleven offenses can be narrowed down to eight. The\r\nseverity of the slave code can be shown by comparison of the capital\r\ncrimes for white persons at the same time. These were four in number,\r\n(1) murder, (2) carnal abuse of a female under ten years of age, (3)\r\nwilful burning of the penitentiary and (4) being an accessory to the\r\nfact.[297]\r\n\r\nVirginia had early enacted that slaves should be considered as real\r\nestate in the settlement of inheritances. But the growing tendency to\r\nlook upon the slaves in all things else as personal chattels led to\r\nsuch legal and popular confusion that the Virginia assembly often\r\nobserved that they were \"real estate in some respects, personal in\r\nothers, and both in others.\" Regardless of such legal complexity it\r\nwas not until 1793 that it was enacted that \"all negro and mulatto\r\nslaves in all courts of judicature shall be held and adjudged to be\r\npersonal estate.\"\r\n\r\nIn drawing up the slave code of 1798 Kentucky disregarded the legal\r\nexperience of Virginia and her more recent remedial legislation and\r\nenacted that \"all negro, mulatto or Indian slaves, in all courts of\r\njudicature and other places within this commonwealth, shall be held,\r\ntaken and adjudged to be real estate, and shall descend to the heirs\r\nand widows of persons departing this life, as lands are directed to\r\ndescend.\" It was further provided, however, that \"all such slaves\r\nshall be liable to the payment of debts, and may be taken by execution\r\nfor that end, as other chattels, or personal estate may be.\"[298]\r\n\r\nSuch a law coupled with the legal precedents of Virginia served to\r\nintensify the mixed property conception of the slave. The confusion,\r\nhowever, was purely legal, for slaves were held in all other respects\r\nas personalty; but in cases of inheritance and the probation of wills\r\nthe Kentucky Court of Appeals was often called upon to define clearly\r\nthe legal status of the Negro in bondage. The first important decision\r\nwas handed down in 1824 in the case of Chinn and wife _vs._ Respass,\r\nin which it was pointed out that while slaves were by law made real\r\nestate for the purpose of descent and dower, yet they had in law many\r\nof the attributes of personal estate. They would pass by a nuncupative\r\nwill, and lands would not; they could be limited, in a grant or devise\r\nno otherwise than personal chattels; and personal actions might be\r\nbrought to recover the possession of them. Furthermore \"they were in\r\ntheir nature personal estate, being moveable property, and as such\r\nmight attend the person of the proprietor wherever he went; and in\r\npractice they were so considered by the people in general.\"[299]\r\n\r\nConversely, the court was often called upon to interpret the phrase\r\n\"personal estate\" in wills and contracts, where it appeared without\r\nany other restrictive expression or provision, and it consistently\r\nheld that the term should be construed as embracing slaves.[300]\r\nGradually the personal property conception began to secure even legal\r\nprecedence over that of real estate when the two interpretations came\r\ninto close conflict. This was accomplished by placing more stress on\r\nthe proviso in the original slave code, which placed slaves in the\r\nhands of the administrator as assets for the payment of debts. This\r\nled to increasing power for the executor who could even defeat the\r\ntitle of the heirs, though the property may have been specifically\r\ndevised. Hence it was not surprising that in the Revised Statutes of\r\n1852 it was provided that slaves should thereafter be deemed and held\r\nas personal estate. Coming after all doubt of the personalty of slaves\r\nhad been removed by the decisions of the highest tribunal in the\r\nState, this law meant little more than the repeal of the old statute\r\nmaking slaves real estate.\r\n\r\nThe wonder is that Kentucky should have chosen to hold to an\r\nantiquated legal conception for fifty years after Virginia had proved\r\nits fallacy by her experience in the eighteenth century. While it did\r\nlittle harm, it had few advantages. The existence of the theory was\r\nchiefly noticeable in the frequent legal battles over technicalities\r\nin the settlement of estates. In the popular mind slaves were always\r\nconsidered personal property, and the spirit of the slave code itself\r\nembodied that conception as regarded all things save the question of\r\ninheritance.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the liberty of the slaves the code of 1798 clearly\r\nshows that the existing type of slavery was purely rural, for the\r\nrestrictions on slaves concerned only the plantation Negroes. Strictly\r\nunderstood, the slave was not to leave the farm of his owner without a\r\npass from his master, the main purpose being to keep the Negroes from\r\ncongregating on any one farm. Later when emissaries from the North\r\nbecame unusually active the rights and privileges of the slaves were\r\nfurther restricted. This change was due to the current belief that\r\nthese foreign individuals were bent upon stirring up strife among the\r\nslaves and inciting them to insurrection. Once started such a scheme\r\nwould have resulted in anarchy especially in the towns. The real\r\ncurbing provisions were not started until along in the thirties when\r\nthese outside forces had begun to make their appearance in the urban\r\ncommunities.[301]\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the State were instituted mounted patrols, who went\r\nabout at night and watched the movement of slaves. They were to\r\napprehend any servant who was caught away from his home plantation\r\nwithout a pass from his master.[302] Such an institution was based on\r\ngood Negro psychology, for his fear of the spirits of night was well\r\nknown. Citizens of that time have told us many tales of the dread\r\nwhich the slave had of meeting these night raiders whom they termed\r\n\"patter-rollers\" and how they came to sing of them in true Negro\r\nfashion:\r\n\r\n    Over the fence and through the paster,\r\n    Run, nigger, run, oh, run a little faster,\r\n      Run, nigger, run,\r\n    The patter-roller ketch you.\r\n\r\nSuch a system of county patrols did not prove to be sufficient as the\r\nslave population grew and the towns became larger and more attractive\r\nto the country slave. The legislature of 1834 in drawing up a law\r\nconcerning tavern keepers had this problem clearly in mind when they\r\nprovided that no person should sell, give or loan any spirituous\r\nliquors to slaves, other than his own, under a penalty of $10 for\r\neach offense. Furthermore, if the offender was a licensed liquor\r\ndealer, he should have his license taken away from him for the term of\r\ntwo years.[303] That even this measure did not prove effective enough\r\nto curb the evil of Negroes congregating in the towns is shown by the\r\nfurther provision passed March 6, 1850, to increase the fine to $50\r\nfor each offense.[304] A still further extension was that of February\r\n27, 1856, which provided that free Negroes were to be included in the\r\nrestriction unless they presented a certificate from \"some white\r\nperson of respectable character.\" No slaves or free Negroes were to be\r\nemployed in the selling or distribution of liquor nor were they to be\r\nallowed to visit or even loaf around any place where intoxicants were\r\nkept for sale.[305] The session of 1858 made the force of the law more\r\nexplicit by defining very clearly the jurisdiction in such cases.[306]\r\n\r\nNot only the State authorities but the towns as well were active in\r\nthe measures adopted to meet the growing problem. The best available\r\nsample of the many provisions which the town councils drew up is this\r\none which was passed by the trustees of Henderson in 1840:\r\n\r\n     It shall be and is hereby made, the duty of the Town Sergeant or\r\n     either of his assistants, to punish with any number of lashes not\r\n     exceeding ten, all or any negro slave or slaves who may be found\r\n     in any grog shop, grocery or other place where spirituous liquors\r\n     are retailed in said town, or who may be found on the streets of\r\n     said town after ten o'clock at night, unless it shall appear to\r\n     the said Town Sergeant, or assistant, that said negro slave or\r\n     slaves, are acting under the orders of his, her or their master\r\n     or mistress, and it shall further be the duty of the Town\r\n     Sergeant, or either of his assistants, to enter into any grog\r\n     shop, grocery or other place where spirituous liquors are\r\n     retailed, in said town, whenever he shall be informed that any\r\n     negro slave or slaves are collected therein. Provided, said Town\r\n     Sergeant, or assistant, can enter the same peaceably and without\r\n     force.[307]\r\n\r\nThis town regulation offers perhaps another proof of the oft-repeated\r\nstatement regarding the slave laws of Kentucky that while they\r\nappeared severe on the statute books they were always mild in the\r\nenforcement. The regulation of the movement of slaves in the towns was\r\nalways subject to the local conditions. Beginning about 1850 there was\r\na growing feeling in some of the more thickly populated sections of\r\nthe State that the type of Negro slave who sought to frequent the\r\nvillage saloons would sooner or later start an insurrection. But no\r\nsuch uprising ever occurred and the fear of such seems to have been\r\ndue to the current animosity towards the activities of the\r\nabolitionists, which was prevalent throughout the State.\r\n\r\nIn the course of time it was considered necessary to treat more\r\nseriously also the importation of slaves. The advisability of\r\npreventing the importation of bondmen had been foreseen in Kentucky\r\nfrom the experience of the mother State of Virginia which had enacted\r\na stringent law in 1778 imposing a penalty of one thousand pounds and\r\nthe forfeiture of the slave upon the importer of any into that\r\ncommonwealth. The ninth article of the Kentucky Constitution of 1792\r\nhad provided that the legislature \"shall have full power to prevent\r\nslaves being brought into this commonwealth as merchandise; they shall\r\nhave full power to prevent any slave being brought into this state\r\nfrom a foreign country, and to prevent those from being brought into\r\nthis state, who have been since the first of January, 1789, or may\r\nhereafter be imported into any of the United States from a foreign\r\ncountry.\"[308]\r\n\r\nThe session of the State assembly in 1794 drew up a law concerning the\r\nimportation and emancipation of slaves but it was largely a mere\r\nmodification of the law of the State of Virginia. It was not until the\r\nadoption of the slave code of 1798 that the question was firmly\r\nsettled by a more definite statement. By article 25 of that act it was\r\nprovided \"that no slave or slaves shall be imported into this state\r\nfrom any foreign country, nor shall any slave who has been imported\r\ninto the United States from any foreign country since the first day of\r\nJanuary, 1789, or may hereafter be imported into the United States\r\nfrom any foreign country under the penalty of $300.\"\r\n\r\nThis was merely carrying out the provisions of the constitution.\r\nSection 26 provided that \"no slave or slaves shall be imported into\r\nthis state as merchandise, and any person offending herein, shall\r\nforfeit and pay the sum of $300 for each slave so imported, to be\r\nrecovered by action of debt or information, in any court having\r\ncognizance of the same, one half to the prosecutor, the other half to\r\nthe use of the commonwealth.\" More significant was the proviso that\r\n\"this act shall not extend to prevent any citizen of this state\r\nbringing for his own use, provided, they have not been brought into\r\nthe United States from any foreign country since January 1, 1789; nor\r\nshall it be construed to prevent persons emigrating to this state\r\nbringing their slaves with them, but either a citizen of this state or\r\npersons emigrating to this state may bring slaves not prohibited by\r\nthis act.\"[309]\r\n\r\nAn act of 1814 amended the above by prohibiting the importation of\r\nslaves by any of the emigrants if they did not intend to settle in\r\nKentucky.[310] An attempt was made by a law of February 8, 1815, to\r\nremedy some of the defects which had been found. The legal penalty for\r\nimportation was increased to $600 for each slave imported and a fine\r\nof $200 was added for every person buying or selling such slave. No\r\nindictment was to be subject to a shorter limitation than five years\r\nand once so accused no person was to be discharged or acquitted unless\r\nhe could produce evidence to show that within sixty days of his\r\narrival in Kentucky he had deposited the following oath, duly signed,\r\nin the county clerk's office where he resides: \"I, ...., do swear that\r\nmy removal to the state of Kentucky was with the intention of\r\nbecoming a citizen thereof, and that I have brought no slave or\r\nslaves to this state, with the intention of selling them.\"[311]\r\n\r\nIt is evident from all contemporary discussions of the question of\r\nimportation that it was the firm conviction that in order to do\r\njustice to the slave and the institution as a whole within the State\r\nit was necessary to prevent the infusion of any foreign slave element.\r\nOnce such a policy had been carried out to a successful conclusion,\r\nthey would have been confronted only with a purely domestic type of\r\nslavery and its increase. With such an ideal condition, for those\r\ntimes, the institution eventually would have been easily handled. But\r\nthese early lawmakers, while no doubt honest in their intentions, did\r\nnot have the wisdom that was tempered with experience, and the\r\nunscrupulous slave traders found further defects in the law and took\r\nadvantage of them. A careful examination of the law of 1794, the\r\ncodification of 1798, and the amendments of 1814 and 1815 will show\r\nthat the whole theory of non-importation is summed up in the word\r\n_intent_. It was the intent with which the slaves were introduced, and\r\nto this alone the penalty attached. They were not to be imported as\r\nmerchandise but every citizen could import slaves for his own use.\r\nOnce these slaves were within the State there was no penalty provided\r\nif they were sold. There was nothing to prevent a man from selling\r\nwhat slaves he had imported and later going without the confines of\r\nthe State and bringing in more. If he were brought before the court,\r\nhe would claim that he had not intended to sell them when they were\r\nbrought in, and no one could place a penalty on his intentions. It\r\nseems that there were other violators of the spirit of the law, who\r\nnever sold any of the slaves but brought them into the State in large\r\nnumbers and then hired them out for such long terms as 99 years.[312]\r\nThe fundamental idea of the law had been to place a curb on the\r\nincrease of the slave population by importation and these acts were in\r\ndirect opposition to the intention of the enactments.\r\n\r\nAn index of the inefficiency of the existing provisions regarding\r\nimportation can be found in the figures on the growth of the slave\r\npopulation during this period when it is borne in mind that legally\r\nslaves could not be imported, except for personal use, after the year\r\n1794. The slave population in 1790 had been 11,830 and by 1800 had\r\nincreased to 40,343 or at the rate of 241.02 per cent; in 1810 there\r\nwere 80,561 slaves or an increase of 99.69 per cent; in 1820 there\r\nwere 126,732, a gain of 57.31 per cent; and by 1830 they had increased\r\n30.36 per cent to a total of 165,213. During the same period there was\r\na great increase in the white population but it was always from 20 per\r\ncent to 40 per cent below that of the slaves. It appears that the law\r\nprohibiting importation was not as effective as it should have been.\r\nWhile none of the statesmen appear to have figured from the\r\nstatistical viewpoint there was no end of discussion regarding the\r\nnecessity of extending the law to include more than the question of\r\nintent at the time of importation.\r\n\r\nThe avowed resolution of Kentucky to deal with the slavery question in\r\nthe most humane manner and to stop any unscrupulous dealing in slaves\r\nfor the mere sake of profit is nowhere more clearly shown than in the\r\nfirm action which was taken not only in the court room but in the\r\nlegislative halls when it was found that advantage had been taken of\r\nthe letter of the law at the expense of its spirit. On February 2,\r\n1833, the legislature passed a law prohibiting all importation of\r\nslaves even for personal use. The only exception provided in this case\r\nwas that emigrants were allowed to bring in slaves, if they took the\r\noath that had been provided in the law of 1815. The evil mentioned\r\nabove brought about by hiring slaves for excessively long terms was\r\nprohibited by declaring illegal any contract which extended beyond one\r\nyear and exacting a penalty of $600 for each offense. This law of 1833\r\nwas destined to be the crux of many a heated argument for the\r\nremainder of the slavery period. Many a candidate for office during\r\nthe next thirty years rose to victory or fell in defeat because of\r\nhis position with regard to this one statute of the State. It was the\r\nbriefest of all the enactments on the slavery question but it was by\r\nfar the most important and far-reaching provision that the legislature\r\never enacted in connection with the institution.[313]\r\n\r\nIt is noticeable that this measure was not brought about in any sense\r\nby the activities of the abolitionists, for they had not at that time\r\nmade their appearance in the State. It was an honest endeavor on\r\nthe part of the native population, slaveholding as well as\r\nnon-slaveholding, to carry out the spirit of their State constitution\r\nwhich had been adopted back in 1792. Thomas F. Marshall, who later was\r\nthe leader of the Lexington group which removed Cassius M. Clay's\r\n_True American_ to Cincinnati, has borne testimony to the fact that\r\nthe slaveholding element voted for the law of 1833. \"At the time of\r\nthe passage of this law,\" said he, \"the sect known by the title of\r\n'abolitionists' had not made their appearance. And, as I was sworn\r\nthen upon the constitution of my country, by all the obligations of\r\nthat oath, I affirm now that I do not believe that the principles and\r\ndesigns ascribed to that party were in the contemplation of any human\r\nbeing who voted for the law. I was myself not only never an\r\nabolitionist, but never an emancipationist upon any plan which I ever\r\nheard proposed.\"[314]\r\n\r\nBut the question was not settled for all time, for with the coming of\r\nthe abolitionist element there was a general tendency throughout the\r\nState to enact stricter laws governing slaves. Many who had voted for\r\nthe enactment began to cry for a repeal of the law, but it was not\r\nuntil the session of 1841 that it was seriously debated in the general\r\nassembly. Then after a long and ardent discussion in the House of\r\nRepresentatives a vote was taken on the ninth of January--with 34 in\r\nfavor of the repeal and 53 against it. Never within the previous\r\ndecade had a bill before the House produced such popular\r\ninterest.[315] It came up in the Senate at the session of 1843 but\r\nafter another warm debate it failed by a vote of 14 to 21. Sentiment\r\nfor the repeal continued to grow and in 1849 the law was amended so as\r\n\"no longer to prohibit persons from purchasing and bringing into the\r\nState slaves for their own use.\"[316] This changed the situation back\r\nto what it was before 1833, for it will be recalled that the main\r\nfeature of the law of 1833 compared with that of 1815 was the\r\nprohibition of importation even for personal use. It could easily have\r\nbeen predicted that such an amendment would pass, for the legislature\r\nof 1847 had passed 27 distinct resolutions granting to as many\r\nindividuals the right to import slaves for personal use. The session\r\nof 1848 made 24 similar provisions.\r\n\r\nThis apparently radical swing towards the side of the slave owner in\r\n1849 was more than likely brought about by the very intense campaign\r\nwhich was carried on by the emancipationists. Such a movement served\r\nto unite the slave forces against any attack upon the institution.\r\nThis tendency was shown not only in the halls of the State legislature\r\nbut in the constitutional convention which met later in the same year.\r\nAlthough the abolitionists had looked forward to some advanced\r\nconstitutional provisions on emancipation and the inclusion of the law\r\nof 1833 in the organic law of the State they were astounded to be met\r\nwith the virtual repeal of that statute by the legislature. On the\r\nother hand the constitutional convention not only rejected bodily all\r\nthe reform measures but added to the Bill of Rights this extraordinary\r\namendment: \"The right of property is before and higher than any\r\nconstitutional sanction, and the right of the owner of a slave to such\r\nslave and its increase is the same and as inviolable as the right of\r\nthe owner of any property whatsoever.\"\r\n\r\nThe slave trader once more had the courage to appear in the State.\r\nRichard Henry Collins in an editorial in the _Maysville Eagle_,\r\nNovember 6, 1849, gives us some vivid evidence of the effect which the\r\nrepeal of the law of 1833 had had in a few weeks' time. \"A remarkably\r\nforcible and practical argument in favor of incorporating the negro\r\nlaw of 1833 into the new constitution reached this city in bodily\r\nshape on Sunday, per the steamer _Herman_ from Charleston, Virginia.\r\nForty-four negroes--men, women and children--of whom seventeen men had\r\nhandcuffs on one hand and were chained together, two and two, passed\r\nthrough this city for the interior of the State, under charge of two\r\nregular traders. We opine that few who saw the spectacle would\r\nhereafter say aught against the readoption of the anti-importation act\r\nof 1833.\" Such scenes as this were the result of the passage of an\r\ninnocent-looking measure which allowed citizens to import slaves for\r\ntheir own use, but which could really be made to include almost any\r\ninflux of slaves.\r\n\r\nNo further change in the importation laws was made until the crisis\r\nimmediately preceding the Civil War, when practically all opposition\r\nwas removed and the law of 1833 was abolished in its entirety.[317]\r\nExplanations of the sudden turn of mind are not hard to find for the\r\nenactment was passed amid the turmoil and chaos brought on by an\r\nimpending war and the radical slaveholders found it easy to get votes\r\nfor their side in a last vain endeavor to save the institution, not so\r\nmuch from an economic standpoint as from a matter of principle. The\r\nlast chapter in the legal history of the importation problem in\r\nKentucky, however, had not yet been written. After three years of the\r\narmed conflict between the North and the South, Kentucky, which had\r\nremained loyal to the Union and fought against the slave power of the\r\nSouth, reenacted on February 2, 1864, the old law of 1798 on the\r\nprohibition of the importation of slaves.[318] The wording was\r\nsomewhat different, but the essential provisions were the same.\r\nComing at such a time, it never had any significance in the slavery\r\nproblem in the State, but it is interesting as one of the last vain\r\nefforts of the institution before it was mustered out of the State by\r\nan amendment to the federal constitution, which was passed without the\r\nassent of the State legislature of Kentucky.\r\n\r\nNo less serious than the question of importation was the problem of\r\nthe fugitive slave. This has been treated many times and every\r\ndiscussion of it has involved much of what transpired in Kentucky or\r\non its borders. It is not the purpose here to repeat any of that story\r\nbecause it belongs rather to the anti-slavery field, and, furthermore,\r\nhas been recently very well treated by A. E. Martin in his\r\n_Anti-slavery Movement in Kentucky_. We are here concerned with the\r\nlegal phase of the fugitive problem as it existed in Kentucky\r\nthroughout this period, as an internal question; in the relation\r\nbetween the State and other States; and between the State and the\r\nfederal authorities. In so far as it relates to the law within the\r\nState such a discussion naturally divides itself into two\r\nphases--those measures which affected the fugitive slave himself, and\r\nthose which were directed towards conspirators who might have brought\r\nabout the escape of slaves. The former group of laws were enacted, for\r\nthe most part, in the early days of statehood, for a runaway slave was\r\na natural evil in any condition of servitude. The latter group of\r\nmeasures were passed in the later days of the institution when the\r\nanti-slavery propagandists came in from the North, for until then\r\nthere were no cases of enticement. A large majority of those who were\r\nplaced on trial for conspiracy in the history of slavery in Kentucky\r\nproved to be outsiders who had come into the State after 1835. The\r\ncitizens of the commonwealth who were opposed to the institution were\r\nsatisfied to confine themselves to mere words advocating the\r\nemancipation of slaves.\r\n\r\nThe State early adopted the slave code of Virginia in regard to the\r\ntreatment of runaway slaves just as it did in regard to the general\r\nlegal rights of the bonded Negro but provided more drastic regulations\r\nin 1798. Any person who suspected a Negro of being a runaway slave\r\ncould take him before a justice of the peace, and swear to his belief\r\nin the guilt of the accused. Being provided with a certificate from\r\nthe justice where he found the slave, the apprehender could then take\r\nthe fugitive back to the owner and might collect ten shillings as a\r\nreward and an additional shilling for each mile of travel necessary in\r\nbringing the slave to the master. If the money should not be paid, the\r\nperson entitled to it could recover the sum in any court of record in\r\nthe State upon the production of his certificate of apprehension as\r\nlegal evidence.[319]\r\n\r\nIn many cases the runaway could not be identified as the property of\r\nany particular owner, so provision was made for the commitment of the\r\noffender to the county jail. The keeper was forthwith to post a\r\nbulletin on the courthouse with a complete description of the Negro.\r\nIf at the end of two months no claimant appeared the sheriff was to\r\npublish an advertisement in the _Lexington Gazette_ for three\r\nconsecutive months so that the news of capture would reach a larger\r\npublic. In the meantime the sheriff was authorized to hire out the\r\nfugitive and the wages thus received were to pay for the reward of the\r\ncaptor and the expenses incurred by the county officials. If the owner\r\nappeared during the period and proved his property, he could have the\r\nslave at once in spite of any labor contract, providing he would pay\r\nany excess of expenses over wages received. But often the master never\r\nappeared and if a year had expired since the last advertisement had\r\nbeen published in the _Gazette_, the sheriff could sell the slave and\r\nplace the proceeds of the sale plus the wages received over the\r\nexpenses, in the county treasury. This sum was credited to the unknown\r\nowner, for if he should appear at any future time the county would\r\nreimburse him for his loss, otherwise the fund reverted to the\r\ncounty.[320]\r\n\r\nThis legal code for the apprehension of runaway slaves remained\r\npractically unchanged throughout the period of slavery. The only\r\namendments which were ever made were those for the increase of the\r\nreward to the captor and it is significant that the first of these\r\nchanges did not come until more than a generation later in 1835. Then\r\nthe compensation was divided into three classes: for those captured in\r\ntheir own county, $10; in another county, $20; out of the State,\r\n$30.[321] Just three years later it was found necessary to increase\r\nthis by the following interesting law: \"The compensation for\r\napprehending fugitive slaves taken without this commonwealth, and in a\r\nState where slavery is not tolerated by law, shall be one hundred\r\ndollars, on the delivery to the owner at his residence within this\r\ncommonwealth, and seventy-five dollars if lodged in the jail of any\r\ncounty in this commonwealth, and the owner be notified so as to be\r\nable to reclaim the slave.\"[322] There were no more advances until a\r\nlaw of March 3, 1860, increased the reward to one hundred and fifty\r\ndollars if the slave were caught outside the State and brought back to\r\nthe home county; one hundred and twenty-five dollars if caught outside\r\nthe State and brought back to any county in Kentucky; and twenty\r\ndollars if caught anywhere in the home county.\r\n\r\nThe trend of these laws, from the viewpoint of the rewards alone,\r\nshows the increasing importance of the fugitive problem to the\r\nslaveholding group. It is noticeable that from the year 1798 until\r\n1835 there was not sufficient pressure upon the State legislature to\r\nincrease the reward to the captor of a runaway. It is further evident\r\nfrom the scarcity of contemporary advertisements that there were\r\ncomparatively few Negroes who ventured forth from the neighborhood of\r\ntheir masters. But with the rise of the anti-slavery movement in the\r\nNorth and the growth of abolition sentiment as expressed by the\r\napostles of Negro freedom who had come from across the Ohio, the\r\nslaves tended to run away in ever-increasing numbers. This was soon\r\nfollowed by a more rigid policy of apprehension upon the part of the\r\nKentucky legal authorities, apparent in the increasing reward.\r\n\r\nNot all cases of fugitives were to be reached by a mere system of\r\ncapture and reward. Barely did a slave make his escape into a free\r\nState without the aid of some one in sympathy with him. Hence the need\r\nfor legal machinery to punish those who assisted runaways. From a\r\nchronological point of view the laws governing such cases divide\r\nthemselves into two parts; in the early days they refer to those who\r\nwould help a slave who had already escaped; in the later period they\r\nwere directed towards those who induced slaves to leave their home\r\nplantations.\r\n\r\nWhichever of the free States he tried to reach it was necessary for\r\nthe Negro to cross the Ohio River to get to his haven of refuge. If\r\nthe Kentucky authorities could prevent him from crossing the stream on\r\nthe northern and western boundary, they could prevent any slave from\r\nmaking a successful escape. Consequently the legislature as early as\r\n1823 attempted to solve the problem by passing a law forbidding\r\nmasters of vessels and others from employing and removing Negroes out\r\nof the State.[323] This act prevented runaways from securing work on a\r\nsteamboat with the specific purpose of leaving once they were on free\r\nsoil. But as usual this enactment was not effective, because there was\r\na loop-hole in it. The State assembly in 1831, therefore, provided\r\nthat no ferryman on the Ohio River should transport slaves across from\r\nKentucky. No other person, not owning or keeping a ferry, was to be\r\npermitted to set slaves over, or to loan them boats or watercraft.\r\nSlaves could only cross the river when they had the written consent of\r\ntheir masters. Each and every owner of a ferry was required to give\r\nbond in the sum of $3,000 to carry out the spirit of the law; and for\r\nevery violation he was subject to a fine of $200.[324]\r\n\r\nNot content with their previous efforts the general assembly of 1838\r\nwent still further and prohibited slaves from going as passengers on\r\nmail stages or coaches anywhere within the State, except upon the\r\nwritten request of their owners, or in the master's company. The\r\nliability for the enforcement of the law rested upon the stage\r\nproprietors, who were to be fined $100 for each slave illegally\r\ntransported.[325]\r\n\r\nNo stringent laws were made against the enticement of slaves to run\r\naway until 1830 when the abolitionists first began to appear. Until\r\nthat time there seems to have been no need for any legal enactment\r\nregarding the question. The only trouble previously had been with the\r\nwhites and free Negroes who aided a slave already on his way to the\r\nNorth. It was in response to the popular demand that on January 28,\r\n1830, the State legislature provided severe penalties for any person\r\nfound guilty of (1) enticing a slave to leave his owner, (2)\r\nfurnishing a forged paper of freedom, (3) assisting a slave to escape\r\nout of the State, (4) enticing a slave to run away, or (5) concealing\r\na runaway slave. Should a person be suspected of any one of these\r\noffenses and not be found guilty, he was to give security for his good\r\nbehavior to avoid all accusation in the future.[326]\r\n\r\nThe most interesting legal case based on this law was that of Delia\r\nWebster, a young lady from Vermont, who was tried in the Fayette\r\nCircuit Court in December, 1844, for the enticement of a Negro slave\r\nboy from Lexington. The details of the trial show that the court was\r\njust and fair in spite of the fact that both Miss Webster and her\r\ncopartner, Calvin Fairbank, were not citizens of the State and had\r\nfurthermore used all kinds of deceit to accomplish their purpose. For\r\nthe sake of aiding one Negro slave boy to reach freedom they went to\r\nthe expense and trouble to feign an elopement to Ohio via Maysville,\r\nbut the Lexington authorities caught them as they were coming back on\r\nthe Lexington Pike near Paris. At the trial it was shown that\r\nFairbank was in Kentucky for no other reason than to induce slaves to\r\nescape to the North and that Miss Webster had come to Lexington as a\r\nschool teacher merely as a cloak for her abolitionist work. The\r\nevidence offered by the prosecution was damaging in the extreme. The\r\ndefense put forth no data for her side at all, evidently preferring to\r\nbe hailed as a martyr to the cause for which she stood. The jury\r\nbrought in a verdict of guilty and she was sentenced to serve two\r\nyears in the State penitentiary.[327]\r\n\r\nThe young accomplice, Calvin Fairbank, proved to be the most\r\npersistent abolitionist the Kentucky authorities ever encountered. He\r\npleaded guilty to the indictment as charged and was sentenced to serve\r\n15 years in the penitentiary, to which he was taken February 18, 1845.\r\nEvidently convinced that he had been punished sufficiently Governor\r\nJohn J. Crittenden pardoned him August 23, 1849, on condition that he\r\nleave the State at once.[328] But such an ardent young enthusiast for\r\nthe cause of Negro freedom soon found that there were other slaves who\r\nwere in need of his aid and on November 3, 1851, he came across from\r\nJeffersonville to Louisville under the cover of night and \"kidnapped\"\r\na young mulatto woman who had been doomed to be sold at auction.[329]\r\nPresumably in the hope of rescuing other slaves he remained in the\r\nvicinity for several days until on the morning of November 9 he was\r\narrested by the Kentucky authorities. Fairbank was placed in jail\r\npending his trial, which took place in the following March, when he\r\nwas again sentenced to serve 15 years at hard labor in the State\r\npenitentiary. He began his term March 9, 1852.[330] This time he was\r\nnot so fortunate in an early release. The chief executives of the\r\nState from time to time refused to pardon him. In April, 1864,\r\nGovernor Bramlette was called to Washington by President Lincoln for\r\na conference and Richard T. Jacobs, the Lieutenant-Governor, became\r\nthe acting Governor. This son-in-law of Thomas H. Benton had taken\r\nmore or less pity on Fairbank, for he had stated to the prisoner that\r\nif he ever became the chief executive he would release him. The\r\nopportunity thus being presented for the first time, Jacob pardoned\r\nFairbank on April 15, 1864, after a continuous imprisonment of twelve\r\nyears. Such was the experience in Kentucky of an ardent northern\r\nabolitionist who boasted that he had \"liberated forty-seven slaves\r\nfrom hell.\"[331]\r\n\r\nThe systematic stealing of slaves from Kentucky had begun about 1841\r\nand at the time of the Webster and Fairbank trial was at its height.\r\nThis movement was one of the results growing out of the animosity\r\ncreated by another legal case which occurred in 1838--that of the Rev.\r\nJohn B. Mahan of Brown County, Ohio. This Methodist minister, although\r\nliving in the State of Ohio, was indicted by the grand jury of Mason\r\nCounty, Kentucky, for having aided in the escape of certain slaves.\r\nGovernor Clark, of Kentucky, then issued a requisition on the Governor\r\nof Ohio for Mahan as a \"fugitive from justice.\" Upon receipt of the\r\ndemand, the chief executive of Ohio immediately issued a warrant for\r\nthe arrest of the minister. A short time later he became convinced\r\nthat this step had been too hasty, because Mahan had never been in\r\nKentucky. His offense had merely consisted in helping runaways along\r\nthe \"underground railroad,\" once they were on free soil.\r\n\r\nHence, Governor Vance sent a special messenger to the chief executive\r\nof Kentucky redemanding the alleged fugitive from justice. Governor\r\nClark made this very cordial and diplomatic reply:\r\n\r\n     The position assumed by you in relation to the fact of Mahan\r\n     having never been within the limits of Kentucky is clearly\r\n     correct, and if upon the legal investigation of the case it be\r\n     found true, he will doubtless be acquitted. I feel great\r\n     solicitude that this citizen of your state, who has been arrested\r\n     and brought to Kentucky, upon my requisition, shall receive\r\n     ample and full justice, and that, if upon legal investigation he\r\n     be found innocent of the crime alleged against him, he shall be\r\n     released and set at liberty. I will, therefore, address a letter\r\n     to the judge and commonwealth attorney of the Mason Circuit,\r\n     communicating to them the substance of your letter, and the\r\n     evidence which you have transmitted to me.[332]\r\n\r\nThe efforts of the Governor of Ohio were eventually successful, for in\r\nspite of his slaveholding sympathies Governor Clark wrote to the judge\r\nof the Mason Circuit and the latter charged the jury in no uncertain\r\nterms regarding the jurisdiction in the case. After a trial of six\r\ndays Mahan was acquitted.\r\n\r\nThe importance of this case does not rest in the trial and its events\r\nbut rather in the reactions which it had upon the Kentucky populace.\r\nNo one doubted that Mahan was guilty of aiding slaves; but it was seen\r\nthat he had been shrewd enough to confine his activities to the State\r\nof Ohio, where the Kentucky authorities had no jurisdiction. In his\r\nopening message to the State legislature, which met the next month\r\nafter the acquittal of Mahan, Governor Clark voiced the sentiment of a\r\nlarge majority of Kentuckians. Bear in mind that these words came from\r\nthe same man who a month before had advised the Circuit judge of the\r\nillegality of the Mahan indictment.\r\n\r\n     Some of the abolitionists of an adjoining state, not contented\r\n     with the mere promulgation of opinions and views calculated to\r\n     excite a feeling of disaffection among our slave population, and\r\n     to render this description of property insecure in the hands of\r\n     its proprietors, have extended their operations so far as to\r\n     mingle personally with our slaves, to enter into arrangements\r\n     with them, and to afford them the means and facilities to escape\r\n     from their owners. This flagitious conduct is not to be\r\n     tolerated--it must be checked in its origin by the adoption of\r\n     efficient and energetic measures, or it will, in all human\r\n     probability, lead to results greatly to be deprecated by every\r\n     friend to law and order. This demon-like spirit that rages\r\n     uncontrolled by law, or sense of moral right, must be\r\n     overcome--it must be subdued; its action in the state should be\r\n     prohibited under such penalties as will effectually curb its\r\n     lawlessness and disarm its power.[333]\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this and similar recommendations the State legislature\r\nearly in 1839 despatched a delegation of members to the general\r\nassembly of Ohio then meeting at Columbus. These men were charged to\r\nsecure a law in Ohio for the better security of Kentucky fugitive\r\nslave property. The Kentucky officials had always been confronted with\r\nthe problem of recovering runaways captured in Ohio, even when they\r\npersonally knew the captive. The old law of 1807 in Ohio was never lax\r\nin the enforcement, but the plea of habeas corpus was habitually used\r\nfor the defendant and, furthermore, it often happened that the\r\nnecessary proofs of ownership were not in evidence. These facts\r\ncoupled with the publicity of the Mahan trial brought about the\r\npeculiar legislative commission from Kentucky.\r\n\r\nHere was a delegation from a slave commonwealth sent to a free State\r\nto demand a rigorous fugitive slave law for their own benefit. The\r\nKentucky committee went even further and suggested the provisions of\r\nthe proposed enactment--and the remarkable thing was that they\r\nactually succeeded. Although Ohio was known to be the home of\r\nanti-slavery interests the law passed without any difficulty. By its\r\nprovisions a slave owner or his agent could appear before any judge,\r\njustice or mayor, who was authorized to issue a warrant to any sheriff\r\nin Ohio calling upon him to arrest the fugitive and bring him before\r\nany judge in the county where caught. Upon proof of his ownership to\r\nthe court the owner was entitled to a certificate for removal. A heavy\r\nfine and imprisonment were the penalty for any interference with the\r\nexecution of either the warrant or the removal of the slave. The vote\r\non this measure in the House of Representatives was 53 to 15. There\r\nhas been made an analysis of this roll call, which shows that the\r\nopposition all came from northern Ohio--whereas those in the southern\r\npart of the State voted for it because they were not inclined to allow\r\nany disturbance of the friendly commercial relationship which they had\r\nwith their neighbor State to the south. Moreover, they objected to\r\ntheir locality being used as a place of refuge for unfortunate\r\nNegroes.[334]\r\n\r\nHenceforth Ohio became a veritable hunting ground for fugitive slaves,\r\nbut the wiser of the Negroes and the abolitionists diverted their\r\nefforts to other fields of escape, especially through Indiana and\r\nIllinois. The legal authorities at this time began to realize that\r\ntheir hope lay in the enactment of a federal law but no definite steps\r\nwere taken until after the affair of Francis Troutman at Marshall,\r\nMichigan, in January, 1847. Troutman came from Kentucky to Michigan to\r\nbring back six runaways that had been located at Marshall. When he had\r\nfound them and was about to take them before a magistrate for\r\nidentification, a crowd of citizens of the town put in their\r\nappearance and threatened injury to Troutman and his three Kentucky\r\ncompanions. Although the latter were acting in accordance with the law\r\nthe mob would not let them proceed in any manner--not even to appear\r\nbefore the magistrate--but demanded that they leave town within two\r\nhours. In the meantime they were all four arrested, tried and found\r\nguilty of trespass.[335] When these events were reported back to\r\nKentucky mass meetings were held throughout the State in protest\r\nagainst the Michigan action. The State legislature drew up a\r\nresolution calling upon Congress to enact a new fugitive slave\r\nlaw.[336] The Senate referred the petition to the Committee on\r\nJudiciary and they later reported a new fugitive slave bill which was\r\nread twice and then pigeonholed. The same action was repeated at the\r\nnext session in 1849.\r\n\r\nThe general feeling in Kentucky was intensified just at this time by a\r\ndecision of the United States Supreme Court in the case of Jones _vs._\r\nVan Zandt, which had been pending in various courts for five years. In\r\nApril, 1842, John Van Zandt, a former Kentuckian, then living in\r\nSpringdale just north of Cincinnati, was caught in the act of aiding\r\nnine fugitive slaves to escape, and one of them got away even from the\r\nslave catchers. Consequently Wharton Jones, the Kentucky owner,\r\nbrought suit against Van Zandt in the U. S. Circuit Court under the\r\nfederal fugitive slave act of 1793 for $500 for concealing and\r\nharboring a fugitive slave. The jury returned a verdict for the\r\nplaintiff in the sum of $1,200 as damages on two other counts in\r\naddition to the penalty of $500 for concealing and harboring. Salmon\r\nP. Chase was the lawyer for Van Zandt and in a violent attack on the\r\nlaw 1793 he appealed to the U. S. Supreme Court on the grounds that\r\nthis statute was repugnant to the Constitution of the United States\r\nand to the sixth article of the Ordinance of 1787. Van Zandt in the\r\nappeal had the advantage of the services of William H. Seward in\r\naddition to Chase while Jones was represented by Senator Morehead, of\r\nKentucky. Justice Levi Woodbury in rendering the decision of the court\r\nsustained all the judgments against Van Zandt and denied that the law\r\nof 1793 was opposed to either the Constitution or the Ordinance of\r\n1787.[337]\r\n\r\nAt last the people of Kentucky had secured a firm ruling from the\r\nhighest judicial authority on the force of the existing laws. Cold\r\nreason in the light of that day, apart from all anti-slavery\r\npropaganda, justified them in making these demands. Henceforth, there\r\nwas no doubt about the legality of their position--it was a question\r\nmerely of the illegal opposition to the return of fugitives from the\r\nStates to the North. The Troutman case and many others, however, had\r\nserved as an index of northern sentiment in the matter, for the\r\ntroubles of the Kentucky slaveholder were just beginning. A year\r\nlater, in 1848, a requisition was issued on the Governor of Ohio for\r\nthe return of fifteen persons charged with aiding in the escape of\r\nslaves. Imagine the feeling in Kentucky when Governor Bell of Ohio\r\npositively refused to give these persons up, stating that the laws of\r\nOhio did not recognize man as property. It was apparently a political\r\nmove on his part, for there was no question of the property conception\r\nof slavery involved whatsoever. He acted in direct opposition to the\r\nlaws of his State enacted in 1839 and to the federal fugitive slave\r\nlaw of 1793.\r\n\r\nAfter two decades of struggle the abolitionists had come into their\r\nown and it was almost impossible to recover slaves who had run away in\r\nspite of the legal machinery that had been set up. Furthermore, the\r\nmore extreme abolitionists had disregarded all law, orders and rights\r\nof private property and had even gone so far as to proclaim that there\r\nwas a \"higher law than the Constitution.\" Against such a powerful foe\r\nthe forces of all parties in Kentucky united in a firm stand,\r\ndemanding more stringent measures. The Supreme Court had decided that\r\nthe existing law was sufficient to recover fugitives and to demand and\r\nsecure damages for the interference with that right. With the coming\r\nof new conditions, however, it was realized on all sides that new and\r\nmost extreme measures were necessary.\r\n\r\nThe existing circumstances are well shown by the attitude of Henry\r\nClay, senator from Kentucky as well as author of the Compromise of\r\n1850. Noted for his leanings towards the North, throughout his public\r\ncareer of more than half a century, and as far back as 1798 the\r\nadvocate of gradual emancipation in Kentucky, he felt called upon in\r\nthis crisis to express the irritation of his own people:\r\n\r\n     I have very little doubt, indeed, that the extent of loss to the\r\n     state of Kentucky, in consequence of the escape of her slaves is\r\n     greater, at least in proportion to the total number of slaves\r\n     that are held within that commonwealth, even than in Virginia. I\r\n     know full well, and so does the honorable senator from Ohio know,\r\n     that it is at the utmost hazard and insecurity to life itself,\r\n     that a Kentuckian can cross the river and go into the interior to\r\n     take back his fugitive slave from whence he fled. Recently an\r\n     example occurred even in the city of Cincinnati in respect to one\r\n     of our most respectable citizens. Not having visited Ohio at all,\r\n     but Covington, on the opposite side of the river, a little slave\r\n     of his escaped over to Cincinnati. He pursued it; he found it in\r\n     the house in which it was concealed; he took it out, and it was\r\n     rescued by the violence and force of a negro mob from his\r\n     possession--the police of the city standing by, and either\r\n     unwilling or unable to afford the assistance which was requisite\r\n     to enable him to recover his property.\r\n\r\n     Upon this subject I do think that we have just and serious cause\r\n     of complaint against the free states. I think they fail in\r\n     fulfilling a great obligation, and the failure is precisely upon\r\n     one of those subjects which in its nature is the most irritating\r\n     and inflaming to those who live in the slave states.[338]\r\n\r\nThe Fugitive Slave Law of 1793 was superseded by that of 1850 by a\r\nsort of political bargaining on the other measures of the Compromise.\r\nThe letter of the new law was not much different from the one of\r\n1793--the chief changes being in the exaction of severer penalties and\r\nthe transfer of jurisdiction to the federal courts. But even if\r\nmembers from the North did vote for the new provision there was no\r\npublic sentiment in the North back of its enforcement. Everyone in\r\nKentucky was heartily in favor of it, but that mattered little. The\r\neffectiveness of any fugitive slave law depended upon the spirit in\r\nwhich it was met in the North, for it was there that the law was to be\r\napplied. It remained for a more or less forgotten decision of the\r\nSupreme Court in 1861 to show the greatest weakness of all laws for\r\nthe recovery of runaway slaves in the North.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1859, the Woodford County (Kentucky) grand jury returned\r\nan indictment against Willis Lago, a free Negro, charging him with the\r\nseduction and enticement of Charlotte, a Negro slave, from her owner,\r\nC. W. Nickols. A copy of this indictment certified and authenticated\r\naccording to the federal law was presented to the Governor of Ohio by\r\nthe authorized agent of the Governor of Kentucky and the arrest and\r\ndelivery of the fugitive from justice demanded. The Governor of Ohio\r\nreferred the matter to the Attorney-General of the State and upon his\r\nadvice the chief executive refused to deliver up the Negro. The\r\nSupreme Court having original jurisdiction in suits between two\r\nStates, the demand for a mandamus to compel the Governor of Ohio to\r\ndeliver Lago to the Kentucky authorities was heard by that body in a\r\nsuit under the title of Kentucky _vs._ Dennison (the Governor of\r\nOhio). The decision of the court was rendered by Chief Justice Taney\r\nand it contained five important statements: (1) \"It was the duty of\r\nthe executive authority of Ohio upon the demand made by the Governor\r\nof Kentucky, and the production of the indictment, duly certified to\r\ncause Lago to be delivered up to the agent of the Governor of\r\nKentucky, who was appointed to demand and receive him.\" (2) \"The duty\r\nof the Governor of Ohio was merely ministerial, and he had no right to\r\nexercise any discretionary power as to the nature or character of the\r\ncrime charged in the indictment.\" (3) \"The word 'duty' in the act of\r\n1793 means the moral obligation of the state to perform the compact,\r\nin the Constitution, when Congress had, by that act, regulated the\r\nmode in which the duty should be performed.\" (4) \"But Congress cannot\r\ncoerce a state officer, as such, to perform any duty by act of\r\nCongress. The state officer may perform if he thinks proper, and it\r\nmay be a moral duty to perform it. But if he refuses, no law of\r\nCongress can compel him.\" (5) \"The Governor of Ohio cannot, through\r\nthe judiciary or any other department of the general government, be\r\ncompelled to deliver up Lago; and upon that ground only this motion\r\nfor a mandamus is overruled.\"[339]\r\n\r\nThis decision came as a fitting climax to the legal history of the\r\nfugitive slave problem as it concerned Kentucky. Such an\r\ninterpretation placed by the highest judicial authority upon an act of\r\nCongress which had stood throughout the slavery era in Kentucky showed\r\nbeyond any doubt whatever that the legal battle over slavery questions\r\nwas at an end. If any solution was to be found in the future it would\r\nnot be in the legislative halls nor in the court room.\r\n\r\nEmancipation was an important question closely connected with that of\r\nthe fugitive. This was one of the problems to be discussed in the\r\nConstitutional Convention of 1792. There were some few members who\r\nwere in favor of immediate liberation and others inclined towards a\r\nscheme of gradual release of the Negro from bondage. But, as has been\r\nshown in the early part of this chapter, the group in favor of the\r\nexisting institution easily dominated the convention and drew up the\r\nfamous article IX, which remained without change throughout the\r\nslavery era as a part of the fundamental constitutional law. It is\r\nsignificant that it was provided that the legislature should have no\r\npower to pass laws for the emancipation of slaves without the consent\r\nof their owners, or without paying their owners, previous to such\r\nemancipation, a full equivalent in money, for the slaves so\r\nemancipated: that the legislature should not pass laws to permit the\r\nowners of slaves to emancipate them, saving the rights of creditors,\r\nand preventing them from becoming a charge to the counties in which\r\nthey resided.\r\n\r\nFrom a purely objective viewpoint it is doubtful if a fairer legal\r\nguide for the institution of slavery in relation to the rights of\r\nemancipation could have been drawn up. On one side, it prevented the\r\nState authorities from depriving a slaveholder of his property without\r\ndue compensation. On the other hand, no unscrupulous master was to\r\nfree his old and invalid slaves and thereby inflict the burden of\r\ntheir support upon the community as a whole. But this constitutional\r\nprovision had no legal force in itself. It was to serve as a guide for\r\nthe enactment of statute laws later.\r\n\r\nThe State assembly on December 17, 1794, proceeded to the enactment of\r\nthe first emancipation law of the State. The contents of Article IX of\r\nthe Constitution were carefully followed and the detailed legal code\r\nof emancipation laid down in these words:\r\n\r\n     It shall be lawful for any person by his or her last will and\r\n     testament, or by any other instrument in writing, under his or\r\n     her hand and seal, attested and proved in the county court by\r\n     two witnesses, or acknowledged by the party in the court of the\r\n     county where he or she resides, to emancipate or set free his or\r\n     her slave or slaves: who shall thereupon be entirely and fully\r\n     discharged from the performance of any contract entered into\r\n     during servitude, and enjoy as full freedom as if they had been\r\n     born free. And the said court shall have full power to demand\r\n     bond and sufficient security of the emancipator, his or her\r\n     executors or administrators, as the case may be, for the\r\n     maintenance of any slave or slaves that may be aged or infirm,\r\n     either of body or mind, to prevent their becoming chargeable to\r\n     the county. And every slave so emancipated shall have a\r\n     certificate of freedom from the clerk of such court on parchment\r\n     with the county seal affixed thereto, for which the clerk shall\r\n     charge the emancipator five shillings; saving, however, the\r\n     rights of creditors and every person or persons, bodies politic\r\n     and corporate, except the heirs or legal representatives of the\r\n     person so emancipating their slaves.[340]\r\n\r\nThis law remained throughout the slavery period in Kentucky and the\r\nonly changes which were ever made in it were in the minor details to\r\nuntangle some legal ambiguities. The law of 1823, however, is\r\nimportant in showing the discrepancies of the original provisions. By\r\nthis amendment it was enacted that when the county courts received\r\nproof or acknowledgment of a deed of emancipation, or of a will\r\nemancipating slaves, they were to note on their record a description\r\nof any such slaves. The certificate of freedom which was given to the\r\nNegro was also to contain this description and no other certificate\r\nwas to be issued except on the presentation of proof that the first\r\none had been lost or when such was required for use as evidence in\r\nsome suit. If any slave thus liberated was found to have presented his\r\ncertificate to another still held in bondage with a design of freeing\r\nhim, the emancipated slave was to suffer severe penalties.[341] These\r\nadded provisions apparently came to fill all the gaps in the previous\r\nlaw and no further amendments of importance were needed to make the\r\nlaws of emancipation run smoothly.\r\n\r\nOf all the many slavery cases which were brought before the Court of\r\nAppeals in the next thirty years it is interesting to note that nearly\r\nall of them concerned themselves more or less with the question of\r\nfreedom. The very fact that they reached the highest court is also\r\nconclusive evidence that the law was not quite as clear as one would\r\nat first suppose. Close study of the findings of the court will show\r\nthat the judiciary was always consistent in its interpretation of the\r\nlaw and that most of the cases were carried up from the lower courts\r\nbecause of disputes between the heirs of an estate and the\r\nadministrator as to their precedence in the matter of slaves. This\r\npart of the controversy concerned itself with the property conception\r\nof the slave, whether he was real or personal estate, which was\r\ndiscussed earlier in this chapter. The purely emancipation cases\r\nbefore the Court of Appeals divide themselves into three parts: (1)\r\nthose which concerned the interpretation of the statute law, (2) those\r\nsuits for freedom which were based on the question of residence and\r\n(3) those which involved persons detained as slaves.\r\n\r\nMost of the first class of cases concerned themselves with the\r\nemancipation of slaves by will. The number of slaveholders who freed\r\ntheir Negroes during their own lifetime seems to have been very small.\r\nOn the other hand, from a study of the slave cases in court it appears\r\nto have been a very common thing for an owner to provide for the\r\nfreedom of his slaves in his will. The right of a master to dispose of\r\nhis own property was beyond dispute, but, as is often the case, the\r\nheirs were seldom satisfied and they brought the will into court on\r\none or more technical grounds in an attempt to break the document\r\nwhich freed so much valuable property. The court in every case held\r\nthat the right of the owner was absolute and that if by the letter of\r\nhis will his slaves were freed, that right was subject to no dispute.\r\nFurthermore, when the Negroes were thus emancipated they did not pass\r\nto the personal representatives of the deceased, as assets. They\r\npassed by will just as land, and the devise took effect at the death\r\nof the testator, whether it be a devise to the slave, of his freedom,\r\nor of the slave, to another. The servant, thus affected, had only to\r\nappear before the county court and establish his emancipation. This\r\naccomplished, it was the duty of the court to give him a certificate\r\nof freedom without the consent of the representatives of the\r\nemancipator.[342] The right of disposal rested with the owner, who\r\ncould emancipate by act, or by will, and he who denied the right\r\nor placed any claim against it was compelled to show the\r\nprohibition.[343]\r\n\r\nWhile the owner had absolute powers of disposal of his own slaves he\r\ncould not draw up a will of prospective freedom which would hold in\r\nspite of the rights of his heirs. If a master desired to be very\r\nlenient with his servants, he had to make their freedom absolute and\r\nin writing. This was well brought out in the case of an apparently\r\nkind-hearted Kentucky slaveholder who provided in his will that his\r\nslaves were to select their own master without regard to price. They\r\nchose as their future owner a man who did not need them, but who\r\noffered to take them at about half their real value. The court held\r\nthat in such a case the executor was not bound to accept the offer,\r\nsince the interests of those entitled to the proceeds of the sale, as\r\nwell as the desire and comfort of the slaves, were to be\r\nregarded.[344] Another owner had the right idea, but defeated his own\r\nintentions by willing all his forty slaves to the Kentucky\r\nColonization Society. The court held that such an act by no means\r\nfreed the slaves and that by the laws of the State until they were\r\nfree they could be hired out and the proceeds considered as a part of\r\nthe estate.[345]\r\n\r\nAs in all border States there were many legal battles for freedom,\r\nwhich involved the question of residence on free soil. These cases\r\nwere largely concerned with the question of the right of a citizen of\r\nKentucky to pass through a free State on business or pleasure attended\r\nby his slaves or servants without losing his right of ownership over\r\nsuch slaves. The principle involved was early considered in the\r\nKentucky Court of Appeals and faithfully carried out in succeeding\r\ngenerations, viz.: that a \"fixed residence\" or being domiciled in a\r\nnon-slaveholding State would operate to release the slave from the\r\npower of the master; but that the transient passing or sojourning\r\ntherein had no such effect. In an early case in 1820 involving a suit\r\nfor freedom the court held that a person of color from Kentucky who\r\nwas permitted to reside in a free State could prosecute his right to\r\nfreedom in any other State. It was held to be a vested right to\r\nfreedom, which existed wherever he went.[346] In another instance an\r\nowner permitted his slave to go at large for twenty years, but the\r\ncourt held that that alone did not give him freedom. Still under this\r\nliberty of movement the slave went off into a free State to reside and\r\nthe court held that the Negro was then free because his right grew out\r\nof the law of the free State and not out of that in which the owner\r\nresided.[347] An owner permitted his slave to go to Pennsylvania and\r\nremain there for a longer period than six months, with a knowledge of\r\nthe law passed in that State in 1780, and the Kentucky Court of\r\nAppeals held that the slave was entitled to his freedom and that even\r\nif the slave had returned to Kentucky his right could be asserted\r\nthere just as well as in Pennsylvania.[348] But should a slave go with\r\nhis master to a free State and later return to Kentucky with him,\r\nwhatever status he had then was to be determined by the law of\r\nKentucky and not by the rule of any State where the slave might have\r\nbeen.[349] The fact that a slave stayed in New York for three months\r\nbefore his return to Kentucky, his owner knowing he was there, and\r\nmaking no effort to bring him away, did not give to such slave a right\r\nto freedom.[350] A slaveholder sent one of his servants over into\r\nIllinois to cut some wood for a few weeks and later the latter brought\r\nsuit for freedom on the grounds of residence in a free State but the\r\ncourt denied any such right, since the slave returned to his master in\r\nKentucky voluntarily.[351]\r\n\r\nIf an emancipated Negro for any reason was held in slavery and later\r\nestablished his right to freedom in court, he could not recover\r\ncompensation for his services or damages for his detention, unless he\r\ncould prove that he was held under full knowledge of his right or with\r\ngood reason to believe him free. If pending his suit for freedom he\r\nshould be hired out by order of the court, the net hire was to be\r\nawarded to him if he succeeded.[352]\r\n\r\nThe actual number of manumissions which took place in Kentucky will no\r\ndoubt never be known. Among the few statistics are those of the\r\nfederal census for 1850 and 1860 and they include only the figures for\r\nthe one census year. According to this source in 1850 only 152 slaves\r\nwere voluntarily set free in the State or one slave out of every\r\n1,388, a percentage of only .072; and in 1860 there were 170 Negroes\r\nrecorded as freed or one out of every 1,281 slaves, a percentage of\r\nonly .078. We can easily assume from the accounts which we have from\r\npapers of that time that these numbers were far short of those that\r\nwere really set free by their masters. It was the custom of many\r\nowners who were about to free their slaves to take them to Cincinnati\r\nand there have them set free in the Probate Court.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1859, forty-nine slaves from Fayette County, mostly women and\r\nchildren, were brought to Cincinnati and set free and later sent to a\r\ncolony of emancipated Negroes in Green County, Ohio.[353] In March of\r\nthe same year Robert Barnet of Lincoln County, Kentucky appeared with\r\neighteen slaves--a father, mother, nine children and three\r\ngrandchildren and another woman and four boys, who were all\r\nemancipated in the Cincinnati Probate Court. Before crossing the\r\nOhio, while in Covington, he was offered $20,000 for all of them but\r\nhe stated that he would refuse even $50,000.[354] In January, 1860,\r\nWilliam McGinnis, of Bourbon County, appeared with fourteen slaves\r\nbefore the same probate court and set them all free.[355]\r\n\r\nThe law of Kentucky plainly provided that no slave was to be\r\nemancipated unless bond were given that he would immediately leave the\r\nState. Hence it was but natural that a master who intended setting his\r\nslaves free should take them as slaves to a free State and there give\r\nthem their freedom, thus satisfying his own conscience and at the same\r\ntime removing any future legal trouble that might ensue on account of\r\nhis former slaves being found in the State of Kentucky. For this\r\nreason it would seem that a large number of the kind-hearted\r\nslaveholders who freed their slaves did so outside the bounds of\r\nKentucky and thus that State was deprived of the credit for many\r\nemancipations which took place voluntarily at the hands of her own\r\nslaveholders.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[285] _Littell's Laws_, 1: 32.\r\n\r\n[286] Brown, John Mason, _The Political Beginnings of Kentucky_, p.\r\n229.\r\n\r\n[287] _Littell's Laws_, 1: 44.\r\n\r\n[288] _Ibid._, 1: 161.\r\n\r\n[289] _Littell's Laws_, 2: 113.\r\n\r\n[290] _Littell's Laws_, 2: 114.\r\n\r\n[291] _Littell's Laws_, 2: 116-117.\r\n\r\n[292] _Littell's Laws_, 2: 117-118.\r\n\r\n[293] _Littell's Laws_, 3: 403.\r\n\r\n[294] _Ibid._, 2: 117-118.\r\n\r\n[295] _Niles' Register_, February 2, 1830.\r\n\r\n[296] _Littell's Laws_, 4: 223-224.\r\n\r\n[297] Stroud, _Laws relating to Slavery_, p. 86.

In this commonwealth slavery was\r\ndecidedly patriarchal. The slave was not such an unfortunate creature\r\nas some have pictured him. He usually had set apart for himself and\r\nhis family a house which was located near the master's mansion. While\r\nthis home may have been a rude cabin made of small logs, with a roof\r\ncovered with splits and an earthen floor, likely as not the master's\r\nson was attending school a few weeks in the year in a neighboring log\r\ncabin which boasted of no more luxuries than the humble slave\r\ndwelling. The servant and his family were well fed and had plenty of\r\ndomestic cloth for all necessary wearing apparel.\r\n\r\nThe kind of clothing which the Kentucky slave had can be seen best by\r\na study of the runaway slave advertisements where a description of\r\napparel was often essential to the apprehension of the Negro. \"Billy\"\r\nin 1803 ran away from his owner in Lexington and took such a variety\r\nof clothing with him that the master was unable to give a description\r\nof them.[356] \"Jack,\" running away from his owner in Mercer County,\r\nhad on when he left and took with him \"one pale blue jeans coat, one\r\ngray jeans coat, and an old linsey coat; one pair of cloth pantaloons,\r\none pair of jeans, and one of linen.\"[357] \"Thenton,\" when leaving his\r\nmaster in Warren County, took with him \"a new black smooth fur hat, a\r\nyellow woollen jeans frock coat, more than half worn; three shirts,\r\ntwo of coarse cotton and one entirely new, the third a bleached\r\ndomestic and new; one blanket; one pair of pantaloons, of cotton and\r\nflax.\"[358] \"Jarret,\" from Leitchfield, wore when he left \"a smooth\r\nblack Russia hat\" and took with him \"a pair of buckskin saddle bags\r\n... and a great deal of clothing, to wit: one brown jeans frock coat,\r\nand pantaloons of the same; also, a brown jeans overcoat, with large\r\npockets in the side; a new dark colored overcoat, two pair blue cloth\r\npantaloons, and an old silver watch.\"[359] The clothing of \"Esau,\"\r\nfrom Meade County, was described as \"brown jeans pants, black cassinet\r\npants, blue cloth pants, three fine shirts, one black silk vest and\r\none green vest, one brown jeans frock coat, one pale blue coat, velvet\r\ncollar; coarse shoes and black hat.\"[360] \"Stewart\" left his master in\r\nBullitt County dressed in typical Negro attire--\"a black luster coat,\r\nmade sack fashion, and a pair of snuff colored cassinet pantaloons;\r\nalso, a black fur hat with low crown and broad brim, and vest with\r\npurple dots on it.\"[361] \"George,\" living in Marion County, had an\r\noutfit of \"Brown jeans frock coat (skirt lined with home-made flannel\r\ndyed with madder), a pair of new black and yellow twilled negro jeans\r\npantaloons, white socks, factory shirt with linen bosom, and black\r\nwool hat.\"[362] An owner advertising in 1852 stated that his slave\r\n\"Andy\" had three suits of clothes with him when he ran away.[363] It\r\nis perfectly evident from the reading of these slave advertisements\r\nthat the male Negroes were as substantially clothed as any members of\r\ntheir race could expect to be at that time even in a state of freedom.\r\nThe surplus clothing as described above was all a part of the slave's\r\nown property and not taken from the master's wardrobe. There were many\r\ncases of theft but they need not be considered in this discussion. A\r\nlarge majority of all runaway slaves were men and even when\r\nadvertisements dealt with female fugitives it was only on rare\r\noccasions that the owner attempted to give a description of the\r\nclothing which was worn. Will Morton in 1806 gave a list of \"Letty's\"\r\nclothing as \"two or three white muslin dresses, one of fancy chintz,\r\nsalmon colored linsey petticoat, white yarn stockings, and good shoes,\r\nwith sundry other clothing of good quality.\"[364] At such an early\r\ndate in the history of Kentucky slavery the apparel of this young\r\nslave woman compares very favorably with that which was worn by the\r\nwhite people.\r\n\r\nIn sickness the slaves were cared for by the same physician who looked\r\nafter the master and his family and should occasion demand assistance\r\nany member of the owner's household might be found nursing a sick\r\nNegro. There was no limit to the supply of fuel for the winter, for\r\nthe slaves had the right to cut timber for their own use anywhere in\r\nthe woods of the estate.[365]\r\n\r\nAs in Virginia, the slave was permitted to have a little \"truck-patch\"\r\nof half an acre or more, where he could raise any crop that he\r\ndesired. In Kentucky these small plots of ground were nearly always\r\nfilled with sweet potatoes, tobacco and watermelons. The soil was not\r\nonly conducive to their cultivation but they were the three favorite\r\nagricultural products for personal consumption. These particular crops\r\nneeded little cultivation once they were planted and such as was\r\nnecessary could easily be done on Saturday afternoons, when the slave\r\nwas at leisure.\r\n\r\nHistorians have reminded us that in most of the Southern States there\r\nwas a tendency for the more energetic of the slaves to work for pay\r\nduring their idle hours and thus eventually secure a sufficient\r\nsurplus to buy their own freedom. In Kentucky such cases were very\r\nrare. Most Negroes seem to have been content with their condition in\r\nsuch bondage as existed in the State. There were many cases in which a\r\nNegro refused to purchase his freedom although he had the necessary\r\namount of money. George Brown, the famous Negro author of\r\n_Recollections of an Ex-slave_, published in the _Winchester\r\nDemocrat_, has given us some experiences which testify to the feeling\r\nexisting between master and slave. In 1857 his mistress was offered\r\n$2,100 for George, but when talking the matter over with him she found\r\nthat he had serious objections to the prospective purchaser. She\r\nshowed an interest in Brown's welfare by refusing to sell him. In\r\nlater years when freedom was within his grasp for the asking, Brown\r\n\"bought himself\" for $1,000 because, as he says in his own words, it\r\nwas not honorable for him to \"swindle his young mistress out of her\r\nslave.\" Such was the example of a Kentucky slave who purchased his own\r\nfreedom, not for his own benefit, but for that of his mistress.\r\n\r\nAnother factor entered into this question. In the later years, once a\r\nslave secured his liberty, he was immediately required to leave the\r\nState and if such a one had lived all his life in Kentucky, he would\r\nnaturally hesitate to depart into an unknown region. Many of the\r\nslaves did earn considerable money by cobbling shoes, cutting wood,\r\nand making brooms, but most of them showed little tendency to save\r\ntheir earnings for any future deliverance from bondage. They were more\r\nconcerned then--as they often are even yet--with the pleasures of the\r\nday. More often they were to be found wasting their spare change on\r\nwhisky, a problem which grew greater for the master with passing\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the regular Saturday afternoon and Sunday off every\r\nweek the slaves were given several other holidays throughout the year,\r\nthe most extensive being at Christmas time. At Easter they were\r\nallowed two or three days rest and when an election was being held\r\nthere was no work done outside of the regular chores. The general\r\nelection day in those times was the first Monday in August and it was\r\nthe custom for most of the slaves throughout the \"penny-royal\" and\r\n\"bluegrass\" to journey to the county seat, where they would all\r\ncongregate and have a general frolic in accordance with Negro\r\nstandards of a good time. In the later years of slavery the towns had\r\nestablished sufficient control of the Negroes gathering in their\r\njurisdiction so that the drink evil was more or less mitigated. The\r\nfear of the law was a great incentive to their proper conduct on those\r\nrare occasions when they had a whole day in town to themselves without\r\nany tasks to perform for their master. As Rothert has well observed,\r\nhowever, the slave sometimes did have to care for his drunken owner\r\nand take him home. To the student acquainted with Kentucky history and\r\nsocial conditions such a brief statement suggests a wealth of material\r\non the local type of slavery.\r\n\r\nThat ardent abolitionist from across the sea, James Silk Buckingham,\r\nhas recorded a characteristic picture of the Kentucky slave at rest\r\nand in gala attire:\r\n\r\n     \"We remained at Henderson the greater part of the day, it being a\r\n     holiday with the negro slaves on the estate, so that it was\r\n     difficult to get the requisite number of hands to complete the\r\n     landing in a short time. Some of the female slaves were very\r\n     gaily dressed, and many of them in good taste, with white muslin\r\n     gowns, blue and pink waists, ribbons, silk handkerchiefs or\r\n     scarfs, straw bonnets, and a reticule for the pocket handkerchief\r\n     held on the arm. In talking with them, and inquiring the reason\r\n     of the holiday, one said she believed it was Easter, another said\r\n     it was Whitsuntide, and a third thought it was midsummer. They\r\n     were chiefly the household slaves, who are always better treated,\r\n     better dressed, and more indulgent than the field laborers. The\r\n     men who were employed in landing the cargo appeared to be more\r\n     cheerful in their general aspect and behavior than the field\r\n     slaves I have seen at the South: and there is no doubt that in\r\n     Kentucky their condition is very much better than in most other\r\n     states, their work lighter, their food and clothing better, and\r\n     their treatment more kind and humane.\"[366]\r\n\r\nLegally, there were no marriages among the slaves. They were not\r\ncitizens, but property. The men were urged to take their \"wives\" from\r\namong the women of the home estate, if a suitable companion could be\r\nfound. But if not they eventually secured one in the neighborhood and\r\nthe master usually allowed the slave a pass to see his wife every\r\nnight in the week. While such a cohabitation was not exactly a legal\r\naffair most of them were held as sacred as those more legalized unions\r\namong the master class. Many masters paid an unconscious tribute to\r\nthese unions. When there ran away a slave who had a wife living in the\r\nneighborhood or even at a great distance the owner would make mention\r\nof the exact locality of the wife in order that people in that region\r\nwould be on the lookout for the fugitive. J. C. Bucklin in 1824 did\r\nnot give much of a description of David, who had left his master, but\r\nhe very carefully stated that he had a \"wife and children at William\r\nShirley's, about 16 miles from this place, on the Westport Road.\"[367]\r\nAn owner in Fayette county after giving a detailed picture of \"Arthur\"\r\nadded that \"Capt. Peter Poindexter, eight miles from Lexington owns\r\nhis wife, and I expect that he will be in that neighborhood.\"[368] A\r\nmore extreme example was that of \"Dick,\" a Lexington slave who ran\r\naway to New Orleans, the owner thought, because \"he has a wife living\r\nin that city, and he has been heard to say frequently that he was\r\ndetermined to go to New Orleans.\"[369] Such cases as this were the\r\nlogical consequence of the slavery system. They existed in Kentucky\r\njust as in any other slave State, but they were few compared with\r\nthose slaves unions that were never broken.\r\n\r\nIt was to the economic as well as humanitarian interest of the master\r\nto have sympathy with the peace and contentment of his servant. Thus\r\nmost of them took care that the family relationships of the slaves\r\nshould not be disturbed. Oftentimes when the owner of either a husband\r\nor a wife was on the point of moving out of the county the masters\r\nwould get together and make a trade which would obviate any disruption\r\nof the slave family. Under such conditions a man would part with a\r\nservant who otherwise could not have been bought at any price. Such a\r\nsituation was possible only in a State where the personal interest in\r\na slave and his welfare took precedence over merely his economic value\r\nto the owner.[370]\r\n\r\nCharles Stewart in _My Life as a Slave_ has given us his own\r\nexperiences of home life and marriage among slaves in Kentucky. He\r\nlived in Paris and was engaged in handling race horses. Soon after\r\ncoming from Virginia to Kentucky he fell in love with a young mulatto\r\ngirl, who was the property of a Mr. Robertson, who gave his consent to\r\ntheir marriage, promising never to part them by his own free will. In\r\nhis own dialect Stewart dictated his story. \"So I married her, an' tuk\r\nher to a little house I had fixed up near de stables, an' she\r\nclear-starched an' sewed an' broidered an' wukked wid de hand-loom,\r\nan' made more pretty things dan I could count. She paid her marster,\r\nen course, reg'lar, so much a month fur her hire, but, lor', she neber\r\ntouched her airnin's fur dat. I had plenty of money to hire as many\r\nwives as I wanted, but dis one was de onliest one I eber did want, an'\r\nso it was easy enough.\" After two years his wife became very sick and\r\ndied and the grief of the Negro man was touching in the extreme. \"She\r\nwas jes' as fond o' me as I was of her, an' it did 'pear hard luck to\r\nlose her jes' as I was makin' up my mind to buy her out and out, only\r\nen course, it was a fortunate thing I hadn't bought her, as long as\r\nshe had to die, kase den I would ha' lost her an' de money too. Arter\r\nshe was in de ground it jes' 'peared to me like eberything was\r\ndifferent; I tuk a dislikement to Paris, an' I didn't feel like goin'\r\nhome to Virginny.\" His master agreed to let him go wherever he liked\r\nif he could find an owner to suit him and finally Stewart went to\r\nLouisiana after an interview with Senator Porter of that State. He was\r\nto stay six months to see how he liked it and then if agreeable he was\r\nto stay there. He must have been a rather unusual Negro, for his\r\nselling price was finally fixed at $3,500.[371]\r\n\r\nBut life among the slaves of Kentucky was not by any means a path of\r\nroses. Many anti-slavery leaders attested to this fact. The most\r\ntrustworthy statement that was ever made on this general subject was\r\nthat embodied in the pamphlet of the Presbyterian Synod of Kentucky in\r\n1835 advocating gradual emancipation. The following brief extracts are\r\nmost significant:\r\n\r\n     \"The system produces general licentiousness among the slaves.\r\n     Marriage, as a civil ordinance, they cannot enjoy. Until slavery\r\n     waxeth old, and tendeth to decay, there cannot be any legal\r\n     recognition of the marriage rite, or the enforcement of its\r\n     consequent duties. For, all the regulations on this subject would\r\n     limit the master's absolute right of property in the slaves. In\r\n     his disposal of them he could no longer be at liberty to consult\r\n     merely his own interest ... their present quasi-marriages are\r\n     continually voided (at the master's pleasure).... They are in\r\n     this way brought to consider their matrimonial alliances as\r\n     things not binding, and act accordingly. We are then assured by\r\n     the most unquestionable testimony that licentiousness is the\r\n     necessary result of our system.\"\r\n\r\nOne would infer from this observation of apparently fair-minded men\r\nthat slave unions were not very sacred affairs and that any disruption\r\nof them would amount to little, but in the same document these\r\nPresbyterian preachers give a back-handed compliment to the stability,\r\nat least in temperament, of the average slave marriage.\r\n\r\n     \"Brothers and sisters, parents and children, husbands and wives,\r\n     are torn asunder and permitted to see each other no more. These\r\n     acts are daily occurring in the midst of us. The shrieks and\r\n     agony often witnessed on such occasions proclaim with a trumpet\r\n     tongue, the iniquity of our system. There is not a neighborhood\r\n     where these heartrending scenes are not displayed; there is not a\r\n     village or road that does not behold the sad procession of\r\n     manacled outcasts, whose mournful countenances tell that they are\r\n     exiled by force, from all that their hearts hold dear.\"\r\n\r\nIt is strange that these two opposing views should appear in the same\r\npamphlet, but nevertheless they are both undoubtedly true pictures of\r\nslavery in Kentucky. It is merely a question as to which of the two\r\nrepresented the majority of cases. Licentiousness there was, but it\r\nwas certainly very much less among the slaves of Kentucky than in the\r\nfar South. Slave unions were treated with more respect by the masters\r\nof Kentucky than in most slave States. As has been pointed out in a\r\nprevious chapter, the very fact that the few instances of inhuman\r\nseparation of slave families produced such a storm of public\r\ndisapproval shows that it was not a very general practice in the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nFrom the legal standpoint the slave had no rights or privileges in the\r\nattainment of even a meager education. On the other hand Kentucky was\r\nthe only slave State, with the exception of Maryland and Tennessee,\r\nwhich never passed any laws forbidding the instruction of slaves. Thus\r\nno penalty was attached to Negro education, neither was any\r\nencouragement given. Those slaves who learned to read were the\r\nservants of masters who because of conscientious scruples taught them\r\nhow to read the Bible. Few slaves ever learned to write, for they\r\nmight then be tempted to serve as unofficial dispensers of passes in\r\nthe owner's name. The general objection to any reasonable amount of\r\neducation was the tendency towards dissatisfaction with the servile\r\nstatus thereby aroused. If the slave could learn to read well, it was\r\nfeared that he would become a victim of the \"filthy\" abolitionist\r\nliterature, which through the resultant effect upon the Negroes would\r\nhave produced no end of trouble to the slavery system. Hence, for the\r\nmost part, the Kentucky slave remained in blissful ignorance, and well\r\nfor him as such and the institution he represented that his learning\r\nwas no greater.[372]\r\n\r\nOut of a collection of some three hundred and fifty runaway slave\r\nadvertisements concerning Kentucky slaves the author has found 71\r\ncases in which mention was made that the Negro could read and 37\r\ninstances in which he could write. The latter cases are all included\r\nin the former classification also. On that basis a little over ten\r\nper cent of the slaves could read and write and about twenty per cent\r\ncould read but were unable to write. There are, however, two strong\r\nreasons against any such general conclusion. In the first place, the\r\nmore a slave learned the more liable he was to become dissatisfied and\r\nrun away; and secondly, the careful mention which was made in\r\nadvertisements of the Negro's ability to read or write would tend to\r\nshow that it was more or less an unusual accomplishment.\r\n\r\nTaking up the question of the education of slaves in the State, the\r\nPresbyterian Synod of Kentucky said in 1834 that \"Slavery dooms\r\nthousands of human beings to hopeless ignorance ... if slaves are\r\neducated it must involve some outlay upon the part of the master....\r\nIt is inconsistent with our knowledge of human nature to suppose that\r\nhe will do this for them. The present state of instruction among this\r\nrace remains exactly what we might ... naturally anticipate.\r\nThroughout the whole land (State), so far as we can learn, there is\r\nbut one school in which, during the week, slaves can be taught. The\r\nlight of three or four Sabbath schools is seen glimmering through the\r\ndarkness that covers the black population of the whole State. Here and\r\nthere a family is found where humanity and religion impel the\r\nmaster, mistress or children to the laborious task of private\r\ninstruction.\"[373]\r\n\r\nIt should be added in this connection that the same statement would\r\nhold true of the free Negro population of Kentucky at the same period.\r\nUntil long after the Civil War there was no provision made for their\r\neducation other than that of individual enterprise. The public\r\neducation of the whites was not on a plane comparable to that of any\r\nof the Northern States until after the reconstruction period, and even\r\nthen Kentucky lagged behind for years.\r\n\r\nThe church and its influence for the betterment of society under the\r\nslavery system was more effective than the school. The chief religious\r\npaper of the State was the _Presbyterian Herald_ and one of its most\r\npersistent pleas was that the proper religious instruction of the\r\nNegro servant class would answer most of the objections to the\r\ninstitution. \"The most formidable weapon in the hands of the\r\nabolitionist,\" said the editor, \"is the indifference which he charges\r\nto the Christian slaveholder toward the spiritual welfare of the slave\r\nunder his control. Disarm him of this weapon, and you have done much\r\nto render him powerless.\"[374]\r\n\r\nReligious instruction in families of Christian habits of life,\r\nhowever, was not so sadly neglected. The household servants were\r\nusually brought to the house during the family worship and the\r\nscriptures were not merely read to them but explained. No restrictions\r\nwere ever placed on church attendance either by law or by custom. Many\r\nslaves united with the white churches and throughout the State today\r\none may find any number of old churches whose records still show\r\nseveral of these Negroes on the church rolls. Most of them are very\r\nkindly remembered for their good moral character and abiding faith.\r\nSuch a condition was not so prevalent among the agricultural slaves,\r\nexcept where they were few in numbers. Even here, however, the\r\nreligious instinct was not suppressed in any manner. Their religion at\r\nthe most was a very crude imitation of the worship of their masters.\r\nThey were not confined to the rear seats of the white churches for\r\ntheir attendance at Sunday services. They could hold their own\r\nmeetings in schoolhouses and vacant church edifices.\r\n\r\nIt was these distinctively slave gatherings that gave rise to one of\r\nthe most interesting of all Negro characters--the preacher. Tradition\r\nand story have related many a charming picture of this quaint\r\nrepresentative of Negro faith, but unfortunately few life stories of\r\nany of them have ever been preserved. In nearly all the county\r\nhistories we find mention of several of these Negro exhorters who\r\nseemingly were men of some degree of intelligence. The majority of\r\nthem were apparently themselves slaves, subject to the will of their\r\nmasters, and while the restrictions on their movements were very lax,\r\nthey seldom if ever spoke beyond the borders of their home\r\ncounty.[375]\r\n\r\nOne of the famous Negro preachers of the early nineteenth-century\r\nSouth was Josiah Henson. From 1825 to 1828 he was a slave in Daviess\r\nCounty, Kentucky, and in his autobiography he has given us a picture\r\nof the circumstances under which he became a slave preacher. \"In\r\nKentucky,\" said he, \"the opportunities of attending on the preaching\r\nof whites, as well as of blacks, were more numerous; and partly\r\nattended by them, and the campmeetings which occurred from time to\r\ntime, and partly from studying carefully my own heart, and observing\r\nthe developments of character around me, in all the stations of life\r\nwhich I could watch, I became better acquainted with those religious\r\nfeelings which are deeply implanted in the breast of every human\r\nbeing, and learnt by practice how best to arouse them, and keep them\r\nexcited, and in general to produce some good religious impressions on\r\nthe ignorant and thoughtless community by which I was surrounded.... I\r\ncannot but derive some satisfaction, too, from the proofs I have had\r\nthat my services have been acceptable to those to whom they have been\r\nrendered. In the course of the three years from 1825 to 1828 I availed\r\nmyself of all the opportunities of improvement which occurred and was\r\nadmitted as a preacher by a conference of the Methodist Episcopal\r\nChurch.\"[376]\r\n\r\nIn Ballard County there was another interesting exhorter. Advertising\r\nfor his Negro Jack who had run away in 1850, C. B. Young pointed out\r\nthat although he was a slave and the property of the \"subscriber\" he\r\nwas a well-educated Baptist preacher and in the pursuit of his\r\nvocation he was well known by \"many of the citizens of Paducah,\r\nMcCracken County, and also by citizens of Hickman and Fulton Counties,\r\nand is thought by many to be a free man.\"[377]\r\n\r\nThe only credentials which the Negro preacher carried, according to\r\nhis own testimony, came directly from the Lord. His education was only\r\nof a sufficient character to enable him to read the Bible and line out\r\nthe words of the hymns. His creed was never the creation of any school\r\nof theology. It was usually an original interpretation of supernatural\r\nphenomena varying widely even in one individual from time to time.\r\nConvinced of his supernatural calling, he felt inferior to no one in\r\nthe power of exegesis. As long as he held his balance and remained on\r\nterra firma his followers believed in him as he believed in himself.\r\nBut as Lucius Little has well said: \"Once in a while a colored\r\npreacher lost his influence with his congregation by drinking too\r\ndeeply of the Pierian spring. Too much learning raised him out of\r\ntheir orbit. They fell on stony ground.\" Strange, yet how true, that\r\nthe more ignorant a slave minister was, the more power of influence\r\nfor good he had among his fellow human beings.[378]\r\n\r\nJames Lane Allen has given us a splendid little sketch of three of\r\nthese native characters whom he evidently knew in his younger days:\r\n\r\n     \"One of these negro preachers was allowed by his master to fill a\r\n     distant appointment. Belated once, and returning home after the\r\n     hour forbidden for slaves to be abroad, he was caught by the\r\n     patrol and cruelly whipped. As the blows fell, his words were,\r\n     'Jesus Christ suffered for righteousness' sake; so kin I.\"\r\n\r\n     Another was recommended for deacon's orders and actually\r\n     ordained. When liberty came, he refused to be free, and continued\r\n     to work in his master's family until his death. With considerable\r\n     knowledge of the Bible and a fluent tongue, he would nevertheless\r\n     sometimes grow confused while preaching and lose his train of\r\n     thought. At these embarrassing junctures it was his wont suddenly\r\n     to call out at the top of his voice, \"Saul, Saul. Why persecutest\r\n     thou me?\" The effect upon his hearers was electrifying:--as none\r\n     but a very highly favored being could be thought worthy of\r\n     enjoying this persecution. He thus converted his loss of mind\r\n     into spiritual reputation.\r\n\r\n     A third named Peter Cotton, united the vocations of exhorter and\r\n     wood-chopper. He united them literally, for one moment Peter\r\n     might be seen standing on his log chopping away, and the next\r\n     kneeling down beside it praying. He got his mistress to make him\r\n     a long jeans coat and on the ample tails of it to embroider, by\r\n     his direction, sundry texts of scripture, such as \"Come unto Me,\r\n     all ye that are heavy laden.\" Thus literally clothed with\r\n     righteousness, Peter went from cabin to cabin, preaching the\r\n     Word. Well for him if that other Peter could have seen him.\"[379]\r\n\r\nOne of the dominant features of such a type of religion among the\r\nNegroes was the resulting prevalence of superstition. It almost seems\r\nthat in their ignorance they adopted every form of supernatural fear\r\nthat was ever known among our ancestors. But if it had ended there the\r\nmatter would not have been so important socially. In their constant\r\nassociation with white children they brought their fears of\r\n\"ghost-hauntings\" and other fantastic ideas into the minds of the very\r\nyoung. The peculiarity of the Negro slave as compared with the other\r\nsuperstitious races was his own sinister imaginative productions. They\r\nrelated none of the valuable tales of ancient mythology, but rather\r\ndid they fill the earth with goblins, witches and ghosts--the result\r\nof their own dreams and fancies.[380]\r\n\r\nThe many stories of this sort which a \"mammy\" related to a child a\r\nhalf century ago can be reproduced by the old man of the twentieth\r\ncentury and the effect of the old ideas of magic is still with him.\r\nThe prevalence of superstitious ideas in Kentucky today might easily\r\nbe traced back to the associations of slavery times. But such a\r\nweakness may not always have done harm; not every child was so\r\ninfluenced. The natural play of the Negro instinct was worth much to\r\nhis peace and contentment. Here again Shaler has given us a rather\r\nunique observation from his own experience:\r\n\r\n     \"The only movements of the spirit in the religious field that I\r\n     can remember came from two sources: my mother's singing.... The\r\n     other spiritual influence came from the negroes. A number of them\r\n     used to meet at night to talk religion beneath a shed which lay\r\n     open to the northern sky. One of them, well named \"Old Daniel,\"\r\n     had a fervid imagination and excellent descriptive powers. He\r\n     would picture the coming of the great angel as if it were before\r\n     his eyes; the path of light shooting down from about the North\r\n     star,--the majesty of his train. Then the rolling of the heavens\r\n     \"like a scroll\"--I did not know what this process was like, but\r\n     it seemed vaguely fine--and then the burning up of the world. I\r\n     was always greatly moved when hearing these exhortations which\r\n     must indeed have been rather wonderful things, but they made no\r\n     permanent impression upon me. In fact I regarded them as 'nigger\r\n     talk.'\"[381]\r\n\r\nThe patriarchal character of slavery as it existed in Kentucky is best\r\nshown in the relationship which generally existed between the master\r\nand his slave. The pioneers who brought their slaves with them from\r\nVirginia encountered many dangers not only in crossing the mountains\r\nbut after they had settled in the new State. Many were the times when\r\nthe slave proved himself a hero and even encountered death in order to\r\nprotect the master and his family. Tradition and history have handed\r\ndown many of these stories to us, but the most famous of all, as well\r\nas the best authenticated, was the experience of Monk Estill, who was\r\nthe slave of Colonel James Estill, of Madison County. In a struggle\r\nwith the Indians in 1782 in the region where Mount Sterling is now\r\nlocated Monk cried out to his master in the thick of the fray: \"Don't\r\ngive way, Marse Jim; there's only twenty-five of the Injuns and you\r\ncan whip them.\" Colonel Estill was killed and Monk was taken prisoner\r\nbut he soon managed to escape, and after joining his comrades carried\r\none of the wounded men twenty-five miles. The young master was so\r\ngrateful to Monk that he gave him his freedom and kept him in the best\r\nof comfort the rest of his life. This was the experience of what is\r\nsupposed to have been the first slave in the district of\r\nKentucky.[382]\r\n\r\nNot only was the slave on a par with his master when it came to facing\r\ndangers but even in the field of sports he had as pleasant an outing\r\nas his overlord. While the one may have spent the day in fox hunting\r\nor deer driving, when nightfall came the Negro was apt to emerge from\r\nhis quarters followed by his faithful dog in search of possum or coon.\r\nWhile the master may have enjoyed a feast of venison at his table the\r\nNegro was just as well satisfied with the less valuable but savory\r\ngame that graced his own meal.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the house servants most of the slaves of the\r\nState were employed in agricultural pursuits, but, as we have seen\r\nelsewhere, even here they were not to be found in large droves as in\r\nthe States of the South. There were only a few big landed estates\r\nwhich were cultivated by the owners under their own supervision and in\r\nthe large majority of cases the field slaves worked side by side with\r\nthe whites. Often an owner's circumstances compelled him to labor in\r\nthe fields with his slaves and when doing so he rarely demanded more\r\nof them than he did himself. Such a condition was not only true in the\r\nearly days when there were few slaves but it extended throughout the\r\nslavery era.[383] The stories of the mildness of the institution in\r\nKentucky which reached the North were little accredited by the radical\r\nelement, which could never see any virtue in servile labor. Perhaps\r\nthe most zealous abolitionist who visited the State was J. W.\r\nBuckingham, who wrote in 1840 that the \"condition of the Negroes, as\r\nto food, clothing, and light labor struck me as being better in\r\nKentucky than in any other State.\"[384] While traveling in the heart\r\nof the slave section of the State between Frankfort and Louisville he\r\nsaw many instances of black and white laborers, slave and free,\r\nworking side by side in the same field.[385]\r\n\r\nThe relation between the owner and the household type of slave was of\r\na more intimate nature and the master was careful to pick only the\r\nbest of the Negroes. In such an environment we see the picture of the\r\nKentucky gentleman of song and story, and the Negro in all the best\r\nthat tradition has related of him. The latter became identified with\r\nthe family of the master in sentiment and feeling. Under ordinary\r\ncircumstances he had nothing to worry about, and with no cares\r\npressing upon him, he became as happy as any Negro ever was. If the\r\ncrops failed, or the owner became bankrupt he had none of the anxiety\r\nof his master, although he may have displayed the greatest sympathy\r\nwith the existing condition. It was his duty to give only his labor to\r\nhis master and in return he was sheltered, clothed and supported when\r\nsick or too old to labor; and at last when his earthly toils were\r\nover, he was given a Christian burial. The humble affection which the\r\nslave had for his master in conjunction with the extreme confidence\r\nwhich he held for the outcome of all pecuniary troubles is shown by\r\ninstances in the life history of every slaveholding family. No matter\r\nwhat might be the circumstances and conditions of the estate the slave\r\ncould go on in his daily work without any fears or cares, except for\r\nthe one great cloud that in the event of a disruption of the estate\r\nthrough a legal process he might be sold to satisfy his master's\r\ncreditors.\r\n\r\nFrom our present viewpoint the treatment may have been at times rather\r\nharsh but we must be careful to judge it from the general standard of\r\nthose times. It has been pointed out that it would bear \"favorable\r\ncomparison with the treatment of the white sailors in the British and\r\nAmerican navies of the same period.\"[386] The slave code allowed a\r\nmuch severer policy than was generally carried out, for it must be\r\nconsidered that the law was made to fit the worst cases, where such\r\naction was justifiable. Often the attitude of the master appeared\r\nharsher than it was really meant to be. It may have been merely a\r\ndisplay of authority on his part when he reprimanded a servant who\r\nhad really committed only a minor indiscretion.[387]\r\n\r\nThere were naturally other scenes in which the treatment of slaves\r\nwould not appear in such a favorable light. The chronically bad\r\nmaster, however, was at all times and under all circumstances under\r\nthe ban of a just public sentiment. Should, by chance, a slave under\r\nsuch a one secure vengeance on his heartless overlord, the general\r\nfeeling of the community was on the side of the slave. Strange to say,\r\nit was very often true that persons who had known little concerning\r\nslavery until they came to Kentucky, as soon as they had accumulated a\r\nsufficient surplus, became the owners of slaves and proved to be the\r\nhardest taskmasters.[388] Much light is thrown on this situation by\r\nShaler. \"There is a common opinion,\" said he, \"that the slaves of the\r\nSouthern households were subjected in various ways to brutal\r\ntreatment. Such, in my experience, was not the case. Though the custom\r\nof using the whip on white children was common enough, I never saw a\r\nnegro deliberately punished in that way until 1862, when, in military\r\nservice, I stayed at night at the house of a friend. This old man,\r\nlong a widower, had recently married a woman from the state of Maine,\r\nwho had been the governess of his children. In the early morning I\r\nheard a tumult in the back yard, and on looking out saw a negro man,\r\nhis arms tied up to a limb of a tree, while the vigorous matron was\r\nadministering on his back with a cowhide whip. At breakfast I learned\r\nthat the man had well deserved the flogging, but it struck me as\r\ncurious that in the only instance of the kind that I had known the\r\npunishment was from the hands of a Northern woman.\"[389] Shaler lived\r\nin Campbell County in the extreme northern section of the State, where\r\nthere were only a few slaves and the treatment was milder perhaps than\r\nin any other part of Kentucky.\r\n\r\nThe general attitude is best shown by the two laws passed in 1816 and\r\n1830. It had always been considered that the slave, being the property\r\nof his owner, it remained for him and for him alone to serve as the\r\ndisciplinarian of the Negro. The increasing abuse of this right by\r\noutsiders led to a law in 1815 giving the owners a power of action\r\nagainst persons abusing their slaves, and in February, 1816, the\r\nprovisions were made more specific. If any person should \"whip, strike\r\nor otherwise abuse the slave of another\" without the owner's consent,\r\nthe latter could recover damages in any circuit court in the\r\ncommonwealth--regardless of whether or not the punishment so inflicted\r\ninjured the ability of the slave to render service to his master.[390]\r\n\r\nSome of the contemporary comment would seem to imply that the theory\r\nof the law was based on the property conception of the slave and not\r\nupon humanitarian motives. In other words, it was perfectly proper to\r\npunish any slave as one saw fit as long as one did not interfere with\r\nthe property value of the _servant_. Fearon, while visiting the State\r\nin 1818, came across an example of this kind and after telling the\r\nstory of the punishment makes this comment: \"It appears that this boy\r\n(the one who had been whipped) was the property of a regular\r\nslave-dealer, who was then absent at Natchez with a cargo. Mr. Lawe's\r\nhumanity fell lamentably in my estimation when he stated, that\r\n'whipping niggers, if they were his own, was perfectly right, and they\r\nperhaps deserved it; but what made him mad was, that the boy was left\r\nunder his care by a friend, and he did not like to have a friend's\r\nproperty injured.'\"[391] The conduct observed by Fearon was clearly in\r\nviolation of the law of 1816, unless the absent master had given over\r\nhis rights in full to the man Lawe, who administered the punishment.\r\nIt may have been the spirit of the laws of Kentucky that Lawe had in\r\nmind when he spoke to Fearon. On the other hand, it could easily be\r\ngiven the interpretation which Fearon made. The trend of public\r\nopinion was more and more in the interest of justice for the slave as\r\nthe law of 1830 shows:\r\n\r\n     If any owner of a slave shall treat such slave cruelly, so as in\r\n     the opinion of the jury, to endanger the life or limb of such\r\n     slave, or shall not supply his slave with sufficient food or\r\n     raiment, it shall and may be lawful for any person acquainted\r\n     with the fact or facts, to state and set forth in a petition to\r\n     the Circuit Court, the facts, or any of them aforesaid, of which\r\n     the defendant hath been guilty, and pray that such slave or\r\n     slaves may be taken from the possession of the owner, and sold\r\n     for the benefit of such owner, agreeably to the 7th article of\r\n     the Constitution.[392]\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this law, if a jury of twelve men were convinced\r\nthat a master treated his slave cruelly, or failed to provide him the\r\nproper food and clothing, the slave would be sold into better hands\r\nand the master would have to pay the costs of the suit. Most assuredly\r\nthere was no place in the eyes of the law for an inhuman slaveholder.\r\nNot only was such a one a criminal in the eyes of the courts but he\r\nwas socially ostracized in the ordinary circles of the community.[393]\r\n\r\nTwo instances of this kind in Lexington will show the public feeling.\r\nIn 1837 Mrs. Turner, the wife of a wealthy Lexington judge, was\r\naccused of inhuman cruelty. Her own husband was the chief complainant,\r\nstating that \"that woman has been the cause of the death of six of my\r\nservants by her severities.\" The trial caused intense excitement among\r\nthe people of Lexington, more so perhaps for the reason that the\r\ndefendant was a member of a prominent Boston family and her husband\r\nwas a former judge of the criminal court in New Orleans. The court\r\nproceedings were brought to an end when the woman was pronounced\r\ninsane and placed in the asylum.[394]\r\n\r\nEarly in 1839 a Mr. and Mrs. Maxwell were tried in Lexington for the\r\ninhuman treatment of a female slave servant. The indignation of the\r\ncitizens of Lexington is apparent from the publicity that was given to\r\nthe proceedings in the local papers. A Dr. Constant testified that he\r\nsaw Mrs. Maxwell whipping the Negro severely, without being particular\r\nwhether she struck her in the face or not. The lacerations had brought\r\nblood in considerable quantities for he had found some on the steps.\r\nHe had noticed previously that the slave had been thinly clad and was\r\nbarefooted even in cold weather. During the previous months he had\r\nnoticed several scars on her and at one time she had had one eye tied\r\nup for a week. A Mr. Winters was once passing along the street and saw\r\none of the boys whipping the slave girl with a cowhide. Whenever she\r\nturned her face to him he would hit her across the face either with\r\nthe butt end or small end of the whip to make her turn around square\r\nto the lash, in order that he might get a fair blow at her. A Mr. Say\r\nhad noticed several wounds on her person, chiefly bruises. Capt.\r\nPorter, the keeper of the workhouse, thought the injuries on Milly's\r\nperson were very bad, some of them appeared to be burns, and some were\r\nbruises or stripes from a cowhide whip. The trial was held amidst a\r\nturmoil of resentment against the defendants and there was apparently\r\nno one in sympathy with them whatever.[395]\r\n\r\nAny discussion of the relationships in slavery times would be\r\nincomplete without adding the characterisation of the Kentucky master\r\nas drawn by a celebrated author who was born in the heart of the\r\nbluegrass and was thoroughly familiar with the type:\r\n\r\n     \"The good in nature is irrepressible. Slavery, evil as it was,\r\n     when looked at from the remoteness of human history as it is to\r\n     be, will be judged an institution that gave development to a\r\n     certain noble type of character.\r\n\r\n     \"Along with other social forces peculiar to the age, it produced\r\n     in Kentucky a kind of farmer the like of which will never appear\r\n     again. He had the aristocratic virtues: highest notions of\r\n     personal liberty and personal honor, a fine especial scorn of\r\n     anything that was little, mean, cowardly. As an agriculturist he\r\n     was not driving or merciless or grasping; the rapid amassing of\r\n     wealth was not among his passions, the contention of splendid\r\n     living not among his thorns. To a certain carelessness of riches\r\n     he added a certain profuseness of expenditure; and indulgent\r\n     towards his own pleasures, towards others, his equals or\r\n     dependents, he bore himself with a spirit of kindness and\r\n     magnanimity. Intolerant of tyranny, he was no tyrant. To say of\r\n     such a man, as Jefferson said of every slave-holder, that he\r\n     lived in the perpetual exercise of the most boisterous passions\r\n     and unremitting despotism, and in the exaction of the most\r\n     degrading submission, was to pronounce judgment hasty and unfair.\r\n\r\n     \"Rather did Mrs. Stowe, while not blind to his faults, discern\r\n     his virtues when she made him, embarrassed by death, exclaim: \"If\r\n     anybody had said to me that I should sell Tom down south to one\r\n     of those rascally traders, I should have said, 'Is thy servant a\r\n     dog that he should do this thing?'\"[396]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[356] _Lexington Gazette_, August 23, 1803.\r\n\r\n[357] _Louisville Public Advertiser_, July 10, 1824.\r\n\r\n[358] _Louisville Weekly Journal_, October 15, 1845.\r\n\r\n[359] _Ibid._, October 22, 1845.\r\n\r\n[360] _Ibid._, September 27, 1848.\r\n\r\n[361] _Ibid._, May 16, 1849.\r\n\r\n[362] _Ibid._, December 10, 1851.\r\n\r\n[363] _Ibid._, December 22, 1852.\r\n\r\n[364] _Lexington Gazette_, April 12, 1806.\r\n\r\n[365] The best contemporary treatment of this subject in general is by\r\nDr. R.

They were at first somewhat fearsome occasions for a\r\nlittle lad thus to be alone with an aged and stately grandfather. I\r\nsoon won his interest, in some measure by my fears, and came greatly\r\nto enjoy the intercourse, for he knew how to talk to a boy, and we\r\nbecame, in a way, boys together, in our sense of the funny side of\r\nthings. It was the custom, too, for him to divide the session of three\r\nor four hours with a brief nap taken in his chair....\r\n\r\n\"As his rooms were near the negro quarter he would make ready for his\r\nsiesta by sending forth the servantman who waited on him, bidding him\r\ntell the people that they were to keep quiet during the performance. I\r\ncan see him now with his pig-tail hanging down behind the back of the\r\neasy chair and a handkerchief over his face as he courted slumber. For\r\na minute or two it would be still, then the hidden varlets would be as\r\nnoisy as before. Then the pig-tail would begin to twitch, and he would\r\nmutter: 'Jim, tell those people they _must_ be still.' Again a minute\r\nof quiet, and once more the jabbering and shouting. Now with a leap he\r\nwould clutch his long walking-stick and charge the crowd in the\r\nquarter, laying about him with amazing nimbleness, until all the\r\noffenders were run to their holes. Back he would come from his\r\nexcursion and settle himself to sleep. I could see that his rage was\r\nmerely on the surface and that he had used it for a corrective, for he\r\nevidently took care not to hurt anyone.\" Shaler's _Autobiography_, p.\r\n37.\r\n\r\n[388] Little, L.

On the contrary, there were various\r\nelements that devised schemes for exterminating the institution. This\r\nwas especially true of the churches, which represented more than any\r\nother one force the sentiment of the State on the subject of\r\nemancipation. The three prominent Protestant denominations of the\r\nState were the Presbyterians, the Baptists, and the Methodists. The\r\nonly one of the three which maintained a general continuous policy\r\nthroughout the early nineteenth century on the question of slavery was\r\nthe Presbyterian.\r\n\r\nIt was on the eve of the first Constitutional Convention of 1792 that\r\nDavid Rice, at that time the leader of the Presbyterians in Kentucky,\r\npublished a pamphlet under the nom-de-plume of PHILANTHROPOS entitled\r\n_Slavery Inconsistent with Justice and Good Policy_. While the author\r\nwent into the general evils of slavery, such as the lack of protection\r\nto female chastity, lack of religious and moral instruction, and the\r\ncomparative unproductiveness of slave labor, he was not one of those\r\nviolent opponents of the institution, who would abolish the whole\r\nsystem without any constructive measures. A large part of his treatise\r\nwas devoted to the supposed sanction of the scriptures and his own\r\nevidence that the same source was against rather than in favor of the\r\nsystem then in vogue. It was but natural that Rice should recommend\r\nthat the convention should put an end to slavery in Kentucky in view\r\nof his firm opinions in the matter, but he had a clear vision of the\r\nfuture and he expressed his conviction that \"a gradual emancipation\r\nonly can be advisable.\" He summed up his ideas in this sentence: \"The\r\nlegislature, if they judged it expedient, would prevent the\r\nimportation of any more slaves; they would enact that all born after\r\nsuch a date should be free; be qualified by proper education to make\r\nuseful citizens, and be actually freed at a proper age.\"[397] He put\r\nthese ideas forth as a citizen of Kentucky who was interested in its\r\nwelfare and as a prospective member of the constitutional convention.\r\nWhen that body assembled at Danville he did not hesitate to voice his\r\nviews again but the forces of slavery were dominant and the majority\r\nenacted the famous article IX, which determined the slave code of the\r\nState until the institution was abolished by the 13th amendment to the\r\nfederal constitution. The significance of the attitude of David Rice\r\nlies in the fact that as early as the year 1792 he put forth the idea\r\nof gradual emancipation, a policy far in advance of his age but which\r\nin the course of time was held by a large number of the fair-minded\r\nstatesmen of Kentucky.\r\n\r\nIn 1794 the Transylvania Presbytery, which was the governing body of\r\nthat sect at that time for the whole State, passed a resolution asking\r\nthat slaves should be instructed to read the Bible, having in view the\r\nsole idea that when freedom did come to them they would be prepared\r\nfor it.[398] The same body in 1796 expressed the following fair-minded\r\nattitude in the form of a resolution:\r\n\r\n     Although the Presbytery are fully convinced of the great evil of\r\n     slavery, yet they view the final remedy as alone belonging to the\r\n     civil powers; and also do not think that they have sufficient\r\n     authority from the word of God to make it a term of Christian\r\n     communion. They, therefore, leave it to the consciences of the\r\n     brethren to act as they may think proper; earnestly recommending\r\n     to the people under their care to emancipate such of their slaves\r\n     as they may think fit subjects of liberty; and that they also\r\n     take every possible measure, by teaching their young slaves to\r\n     read and give them such other instruction as may be in their\r\n     power, to prepare them for the enjoyment of liberty, an event\r\n     which they contemplate with the greatest pleasure, and which,\r\n     they hope, will be accomplished as soon as the nature of things\r\n     will admit.[399]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1797 the same organization decided that slavery was a\r\nmoral evil but on the question of whether those persons holding slaves\r\nwere guilty of a moral evil they decided in the negative. As to what\r\npersons were guilty they were unable to decide and the matter was\r\npostponed for future action.[400]\r\n\r\nAs early as 1800 the West Lexington Presbytery pointed to the trouble\r\nand division which slavery was likely to cause among the churches, but\r\nthey were unable to come to any decision upon the exclusion of\r\nslaveholding members from church privileges and in a letter to the\r\nSynod of Virginia they asked for the judgment of higher ecclesiastical\r\nauthorities.[401] In 1802 the same body decided on a policy of\r\nnon-interference with the rights of the slaveholding members of the\r\nchurch.[402]\r\n\r\nBeginning in 1823 the Synod of Kentucky advocated the cause of the\r\nAmerican Colonization Society. Their general attitude on the slavery\r\nquestion was an open one as late as the year 1833 when they adopted a\r\nresolution to the effect that \"inasmuch as in the judgment of the\r\nSynod it is inexpedient to come to any decision on the very difficult\r\nand delicate question of slavery as it is within our bounds;\r\ntherefore, resolved, that the whole matter be indefinitely\r\npostponed.\"[403] The vote on this resolution stood 41 to 36.\r\n\r\nThe enactment of the law of 1833 forbidding the importation of slaves\r\ninto Kentucky seems to have induced the Synod to take a step in\r\nadvance, for when they next met in 1834 at Danville they adopted by\r\nthe decisive vote of 56 to 7 a resolution calling for the appointment\r\nof a committee of ten to draw up a plan for the instruction and future\r\nemancipation of slaves in the State.[404] The following year this\r\ncommittee published a 64-page pamphlet entitled \"An Address to the\r\nPresbyterians of Kentucky proposing a plan for the instruction and\r\nemancipation of their slaves.\" Many editions of this work were\r\npublished throughout the country even as late as 1862 when it was\r\nissued by the United Presbyterian Board of Publication in Pittsburgh.\r\nIt was heralded throughout the northern section of the United States\r\nas a very able document and was regarded all the more valuable because\r\nit was published in a slaveholding State. The major portion of the\r\npamphlet was taken up with the general arguments setting forth the\r\nevils of the slavery system but in the last few pages they set down\r\ntheir plan for the gradual emancipation of the slaves in Kentucky--the\r\nmost able contribution towards a reconstruction of the existing social\r\nsystem in the State which had been made up to that time.\r\n\r\n\"The plan, then, which we propose is, for the master to retain during\r\na limited period, and with regard to the welfare of the slave, that\r\nauthority which he before held, in perpetuity, and solely for his own\r\ninterest. Let the full liberty of the slave be secured against all\r\ncontingencies, by a recorded deed of emancipation, to take effect at a\r\nspecified time. In the meanwhile, let the servant be treated with\r\nkindness--let all those things which degrade him be removed--let him\r\nenjoy means of instruction, let his moral and religious improvement be\r\nsought--let his prospects be presented before him, to stimulate him to\r\nacquire those habits of foresight, economy, industry, activity, skill\r\nand integrity, which will fit him for using well the liberty he is\r\nsoon to enjoy.\" The actual plan of potential freedom was stated\r\nbriefly in these words: \"(1) We would recommend that all slaves now\r\nunder 20 years of age, and all those yet to be born in our possession,\r\nbe emancipated as they severally reach their 25th year. (2) We\r\nrecommend that deeds of emancipation be drawn up, and recorded in our\r\nrespective county courts, specifying the slaves whom we are about to\r\nemancipate, and the age at which each is to be free. (3) We recommend\r\nthat our slaves be instructed in the common elementary branches of\r\neducation. (4) We recommend that strenuous and persevering efforts be\r\nmade to induce them to attend upon the ordinary services of religion,\r\nboth domestic and public. (5) We recommend that great pains be taken\r\nto teach them the Holy Scriptures; and that, to effect this the\r\ninstrumentality of Sabbath Schools, wherever they can be enjoyed, be\r\nunited with that of domestic instruction.\"[405]\r\n\r\nThis appeal was not to the officials of the State but to the members\r\nof a particular religious body by its governing organization. The\r\nsuccess or failure of the plan depended entirely upon the individual\r\nslaveholder's attitude in the matter. The committee added this\r\nsentence by way of explanation: \"These are measures which all ought to\r\nadopt; and we know of no peculiarity of circumstances in the case of\r\nany individual which can free him from culpability if he neglects\r\nthem.\"[406]\r\n\r\nThe sentiments embodied in this appeal were not, however, any\r\nindication of the feeling among the slaveholding Presbyterians of the\r\nState nor were they expressive of the Synod itself, for that body\r\nnever took any action upon the address, it being the work of the\r\ncommittee of ten entirely.[407] Davidson, writing in 1847, made the\r\nfollowing comment on the sentiment of the church people in Kentucky at\r\nthat time. \"In the morbid and feverish state of the public mind, it is\r\nnot to be concealed, that by some they (the Committee) were considered\r\nas going to an unwarrantable and imprudent length. The northern\r\nabolitionists were waging a hot crusade against slavery, sending out\r\nitinerant lecturers, and loading the mails with inflammatory\r\npublications. Their measures were marked with a fanatical virulence\r\nrarely exhibited, and the people were exasperated beyond forbearance\r\n... the effects were truly disastrous. The prospect of emancipation\r\nwas retarded for years. The laws bearing on the slave population were\r\nmade more stringent than ever, and their privileges were curtailed.\r\nIn Kentucky, the religious meetings of the blacks were broken up or\r\ninterrupted and their Sabbath schools dispersed.\"[408]\r\n\r\nWhen the subject of emancipation was under discussion in the Kentucky\r\nSynod one of the elders arose and stated that he owned one hundred\r\nslaves, nearly all of whom he had inherited. Many of them were so old\r\nthat they could not provide for themselves, others were women and\r\nchildren whom no one was willing to feed and clothe for their labor.\r\nHe stated emphatically that he had no desire to hold them in bondage,\r\nbut that he was willing to do whatever was best for the slaves\r\nthemselves. If he should free them, what would become of the aged and\r\nthe women and children? Furthermore, it was a serious matter to give\r\nbond and security for the support of so many slaves of different ages\r\nand character. He could not send them out of the State, for they were\r\nintermarried with the slaves of others; and as to giving them wages,\r\nhe could not, for they were eating him up as it was. With a feeling of\r\nintense interest in the slave and anxiety on his own behalf to do the\r\nright, he asked his brethren of the Synod, what he ought to do.[409]\r\nThe position of this kind-hearted Kentucky slaveholder shows more\r\nclearly than any other picture we could draw the difficulties of\r\nemancipation in Kentucky even when one was convinced of the evils of\r\nthe slavery system.\r\n\r\nThe final word of the Presbyterian Church on the whole subject of\r\nslavery was sounded at its General Assembly in Cincinnati in 1845,\r\nwhen a resolution was adopted, as submitted by Nathan L. Rice, of\r\nKentucky, stating that it was not competent for the church to\r\nlegislate where Christ and his apostles had not legislated. This, at\r\nleast for the time being, proved acceptable to the churches south of\r\nthe Ohio and avoided a breach in the Presbyterians such as had just\r\ntaken place among the Methodists and Baptists.\r\n\r\nThe Baptists as a State organization did not pursue a policy\r\nsimilar to that of the Presbyterians. After the failure of the\r\nemancipationist campaign in 1792 and again at the constitutional\r\nconvention in 1799 a few members of the Baptist Church began a\r\nmovement for immediate abolition under the lead of several\r\nministers--Tarrent, Barrow, Sutton, Holmes and others. The policy\r\nwhich they advocated was not only one of immediate abolition but of\r\nnon-fellowship with the slaveholders within their own denomination.\r\nThere was no general governing body for the State, as the Baptists had\r\nseveral so-called associations which covered only a few counties each.\r\nThe trend of opinion throughout the various commonwealth organizations\r\nwas apparently against the position held by the emancipationist group,\r\nfor the latter in 1807 withdrew from the regular organizations and\r\nestablished an association of their own which they called the Licking\r\nLocust Association. They were only able to muster the assent of twelve\r\nchurches to their newer group and soon died out in importance.[410]\r\nThe real sentiment of the Baptists was no doubt much like that of the\r\nPresbyterians, but these early advocates of Negro freedom in their own\r\norganization were entirely too radical even for their own church\r\nmembership. Had they followed a course of action and policy more in\r\nkeeping with their own constituents they might have accomplished much\r\ngood, whereas, as it was, they only stirred up the feeling within\r\ntheir own denomination to such an extent that thereafter little\r\nprogress was made towards a policy of even gradual emancipation of the\r\nslave.\r\n\r\nThroughout the slavery era, however, the Baptists in the State were\r\ndivided into the \"regular\" and the \"separatists,\" the former being in\r\nfavor of non-interference with the question and the latter\r\nrepresenting the advocates of emancipation in one form or another.\r\nBoth agreed that slavery was an evil, but the regular group was\r\nunwilling to make it the cause of the expulsion of a slaveholder from\r\nthe church. In May, 1845, a \"Southern Baptist Convention\" was held at\r\nAugusta, Georgia. The meeting had been hastily called and\r\nrepresentatives were present only from Maryland, South Carolina,\r\nNorth Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, Kentucky, and the\r\nDistrict of Columbia. Mississippi, Arkansas, Tennessee and Florida\r\nwere represented only by letters. The convention had been summoned as\r\na protest against the action of the \"Acting Board\" of the church in\r\nthe country in refusing to consent to the appointment of a slaveholder\r\nto any field of foreign missionary labors.[411] In June of the same\r\nyear the Kentucky Baptists for the most part withdrew from the\r\nnorthern organization and pledged themselves to this newly formed\r\nsouthern convention. The creed was not changed. It was simply a matter\r\nof rebuke toward the northern section's attitude on the slavery\r\nquestion.[412]\r\n\r\nThe Methodists had also struggled to find a peaceful solution of the\r\nproblem of harmonizing Christianity with slavery. At the meeting of\r\nthe General Conference of the Methodist Church in 1845, several days\r\nwere taken up in the debate over the status of Bishop James Osgood\r\nAndrew, of Kentucky. By inheritance and marriage he was a slaveholder.\r\nFinally he was requested by a vote of 110 to 68 \"to desist from the\r\nexercise of the office of Bishop while this impediment remained.\" The\r\nsoutherners in the convention became unusually indignant, declaring\r\nthat the infliction of such a stigma upon Bishop Andrew would make it\r\nimpossible for them to maintain the influence of Methodism in the\r\nSouth.[413] So they withdrew from the convention and in May, 1845,\r\nheld a convention of the Methodist churches of the Southern States in\r\nLouisville. After a nineteen-days' session they decided to set up an\r\norganization of their own to be known as the \"Methodist Episcopal\r\nChurch South\" and to have their first meeting at Petersburg, Virginia,\r\nin May, 1846.[414]\r\n\r\nThe Kentucky Methodist Conference met at Frankfort on September 17,\r\n1845, and the entire attention of the meeting was given over to the\r\nquestion of whether they would adhere to the general conference or\r\nwould pledge themselves to the newly formed southern organization.\r\nBishop Andrew appeared at Frankfort at the crucial moment and stated\r\nall the facts concerning himself and the action which the Louisville\r\nConference had taken as a result of the trouble in the previous\r\nGeneral Conference. By a vote of 146 to 5 they then declared that\r\nhenceforth they would adhere to the Methodist Episcopal Church South,\r\nand that all proceedings, records and official acts would thereafter\r\nbe in the name of the \"Kentucky Conference of the Methodist Episcopal\r\nChurch South.\"[415]\r\n\r\nAt its annual conference in 1858 held in Hopkinsville the Louisville\r\nConference held a very heated debate over the rules of the church\r\nregarding slaveholders. Finally they voted to expunge from the General\r\nRules the one which forbade \"the buying and selling of men, women and\r\nchildren, with the intention to enslave them.\"[416] The regulation\r\nthus repealed, although it was a part of the rules of Methodism, was\r\njust another indication of the sentiment in Kentucky at that time to\r\nresent more and more the encroachments of the North on the slave\r\nsystem of the South and to hang on to the institution with a grim\r\ndetermination. But they were not willing to go to unwarrantable\r\nlengths, for at the Kentucky Conference held in Germantown in March,\r\n1860, a proposition submitted by the sister conferences to the South\r\nwith a view to further altering the rules on slavery was denied.[417]\r\n\r\nThe churches of Kentucky for the most part pursued a policy of\r\nbenevolent neutrality in the struggle which the slave forces of the\r\nState were having with their neighbors to the North. The Baptists and\r\nMethodists within the commonwealth officially never made any positive\r\ncontribution to the forces of either side, and they took no definite\r\nstand until the whole southern division of their general national\r\norganization withdrew from membership in the national conventions and\r\nset up an organization of their own. When this much had been done\r\nboth the Methodists and Baptists of Kentucky pledged their allegiance\r\nto their respective newly formed southern conventions. On the other\r\nhand the Presbyterians of the State maintained a policy that was\r\ndistinctively their own, separate and apart from any acts of their\r\nnational organization. They were the only religious body in Kentucky\r\nto issue officially a constructive plan for the betterment of social\r\nand economic conditions under slavery. When it came to the advocacy of\r\neven gradual emancipation they were careful to state that the plan was\r\nonly published for the benefit of the slaveholding members of their\r\nown religious body. The Presbyterians went further in their\r\ninterference with the institution of slavery in the State than any\r\nother religious body, but even they were not willing to try to extend\r\ntheir home missionary field beyond their own membership. On the whole,\r\nthe churches in Kentucky merely followed the dictates of public\r\nopinion on the subject of slavery, trying to pursue a policy of\r\nneutrality as long as possible and then when it was no longer\r\nfeasible, most of them sided with the slaveholding group. The northern\r\nsection of none of these religious bodies, however, was driven out of\r\nthe State. There were a good many of the so-called \"northern\" churches\r\nwhich remained loyal to the old national organizations.\r\n\r\nThe summary of the actions of the three principal religious bodies of\r\nthe State shows that there was a growing sentiment against the\r\ninstitution of slavery. Kentucky being a slaveholding State, the\r\nsignificance of this attitude was very important. While it may be true\r\nthat the majority sentiment even among the churches was not in favor\r\nof the elimination of slavery the very fact that even a minority were\r\ncoming to the front unmolested by violence and threats and favoring\r\nthe gradual elimination of the established institution revealed the\r\ngeneral trend of public opinion among the people of Kentucky. These\r\nmeasures were taken entirely upon their own initiative and were not\r\nprompted by an outside anti-slavery influence.\r\n\r\nAny discussion of the evolution of public opinion in Kentucky on the\r\nsubject of emancipation and of slavery in general would be incomplete\r\nwithout describing the attitude of Henry Clay toward the institution\r\nin Kentucky. During almost the entire period of slavery in Kentucky he\r\nwas the foremost citizen of the State and one of the principal\r\nslaveholders. From those two viewpoints alone anything that he had to\r\nsay on the local type and problems of slavery is valuable in this\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\nThe general position of Clay on the subject of Negro servitude has\r\nnever been very widely understood. Among the radical abolitionists of\r\nthe North he was looked upon as a friend of slavery for the sake of\r\npolitical advancement and among the slaveholders in some parts of the\r\nSouth he was regarded as almost a member of the Garrisonian group of\r\nthe enemies of slavery. To understand Clay's real position we need\r\nonly to consider his relation to the institution as it existed in his\r\nnative State.\r\n\r\nComing from Virginia to Lexington in 1797, Clay soon found ample\r\nopportunities for a public career. He first came into prominence as a\r\nwriter on slavery in the columns of the _Lexington Gazette_ and the\r\n_Kentucky Reporter_. When the constitutional convention of 1799 was\r\ncalled for a revision of the fundamental law of the State Clay bent\r\nall his efforts towards the adoption of a system of gradual\r\nemancipation for the slaves of Kentucky. It was pointed out that there\r\nwere relatively few slaves in the State and that a progressive plan of\r\nliberation would be much easier than at any future time.\r\n\r\nThe consensus of opinion at the time was that the emancipationists led\r\nby this young man from Virginia would have been successful, had it not\r\nbeen for the intervening excitement produced by the Alien and Sedition\r\nLaws and the resulting famous Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions of\r\n1798. Clay threw himself heart and soul into the newer campaign\r\nagainst the mistakes of the Federalists and the former enthusiasm for\r\nthe gradual freedom of the slaves seems to have died down in his\r\nthought as well as among the Kentucky people in general. Thus the\r\nconstitutional convention of 1799 left the conditions of slavery as\r\nthey were.\r\n\r\nIn a speech delivered three decades later before the Kentucky\r\nColonization Society, Clay said in commenting on his position in 1798:\r\n\"More than thirty years ago, an attempt was made, in this\r\ncommonwealth, to adopt a system of gradual emancipation, similar to\r\nthat which the illustrious Franklin had mainly contributed to\r\nintroduce in 1780, in the state founded by the benevolent Penn. And\r\namong the facts of my life which I look back to with most satisfaction\r\nis that of my having cooperated, with other zealous and intelligent\r\nfriends, to procure the establishment of that system in this state. We\r\nwere overpowered by numbers, but submitted to the decision of the\r\nmajority with that grace which the minority in a republic should ever\r\nyield to that decision. I have, nevertheless, never ceased, and shall\r\nnever cease, to regret a decision, the effects of which have been to\r\nplace us in the rear of our neighbors, who are exempt from slavery, in\r\nthe state of agriculture, the progress of manufactures, the advance of\r\nimprovements, and the general progress of society.\"[418] In his famous\r\nspeech in the Senate on Abolition in 1839, referring further to his\r\nactivities in 1798, Clay stated that \"no one was rash enough to\r\npropose or think of immediate abolition. No one was rash enough to\r\nthink of throwing loose upon the community, ignorant and unprepared,\r\nthe untutored slaves of the state.\"[419]\r\n\r\nClay's private dealings with the institution were always consistent\r\nwith his political principles on the subject of slavery. He bought\r\nmany slaves during his lifetime but he never sold any.[420] Clay\r\nbelieved that the slaves should be freed, but at the same time\r\nconsidered the difficulties attendant upon instant emancipation. Among\r\nthe mass of the slaveholders of the State, Clay was one of the very\r\nfew who held a perfectly consistent attitude on gradual emancipation\r\nas was finally shown by his will.[421]\r\n\r\nWith a more radical policy than that of Henry Clay the Kentucky\r\nAbolition Society had been established as early as 1807, but its\r\nmembership was composed largely of Presbyterian and Baptist preachers\r\nwho were not in sympathy with the stand taken by the constitutional\r\nconvention of 1799. It was not until about 1830 that there began in\r\nthe State any real movement which was wide enough in influence to be\r\ntaken as an indication of the trend of public opinion. It will be\r\nrecalled that it was not until 1835 that the Presbyterian Synod was\r\nable to decide on a plan of gradual emancipation.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1831 that some 48 slaveholders of Kentucky met and declared\r\nthemselves in favor of the gradual liberation of the slaves.[422]\r\nJames G. Birney, who was at that time living in Danville, took this\r\nstatement of the slave owners rather seriously and sent out an\r\ninvitation to the prominent men of the State to attend an\r\nemancipation convention on December 6, 1831. After several months of\r\ndetermined effort Birney only succeeded in getting together nine men,\r\nall slaveholders. It is evident from the writings of Birney that he\r\nthought these men were all determined to free their slaves and that\r\nwhatever plan he should propose would be accepted. But when the nine\r\nslaveholders began to talk about the existing conditions in Kentucky\r\nBirney's eyes were opened. It was pointed out that those who advocated\r\nimmediate emancipation were coming more and more to be victims of\r\nsocial ostracism. Furthermore, Birney learned that there was among the\r\nprominent slaveholders of the State a sort of secret organization\r\nwhich had been formed to protect the constitutional rights of Kentucky\r\nslaveholders against the encroachments of the people from the North.\r\nJames G. Birney was one of the most intelligent of the Kentuckians who\r\nfavored emancipation, but the ardent enthusiasm which he had hitherto\r\nheld for the future of his cause in Kentucky was decidedly cooled by\r\nthis little gathering of nine slaveholders. These men showed him a\r\npoint of view about which he had thought very little. Outside of the\r\nnew vision which this conference gave to Birney the only result of the\r\ndeliberations was that there was formed a society of slaveholders\r\nwhich advocated the gradual emancipation of the future offspring of\r\nslaves when they reached the age of twenty-one.[423]\r\n\r\nSoon after this episode Birney came out in opposition to both gradual\r\nemancipation and colonization. The majority of liberal-minded\r\nKentuckians were coming more and more to believe in these two\r\npropositions as the ultimate solution of the slave problems of the\r\nState and once Birney came out in opposition to them he was put down\r\nas a radical abolitionist. In July, 1835, the feeling of the people of\r\nDanville was aroused to the highest pitch and his anti-slavery paper\r\n_The Philanthropist_ was forced to suspend publication when the local\r\nprinter was bought out.[424] The feeling of the people throughout the\r\nState, however, was well shown by the fact that for the next two\r\nmonths Birney made personal visits to Lexington, Frankfort and\r\nLouisville in an attempt to get a printer to issue his newspaper. He\r\nwas entirely unsuccessful and on September 13 he wrote to Gerrit Smith\r\nthat he had determined to move to Cincinnati.[425] While the people of\r\nthe State could not agree with Birney's attitude on slavery they were\r\nthe first to admire his courage. George D. Prentice, the pro-slavery\r\neditor of the _Louisville Journal_, had this comment to make:\r\n\r\n     \"He is an enthusiastic, but, in our opinion, a visionary\r\n     philanthropist, whose efforts, though well intended, are likely\r\n     to be of no real service to the cause of humanity. He at least\r\n     shows, however, that he has the courage to reside among the\r\n     people whose institutions he assails. He is not like William\r\n     Lloyd Garrison living in Massachusetts, and opening the battery\r\n     upon the states five hundred or one thousand miles off. He is not\r\n     such a coward or fool as to think of cannonading the South from\r\n     the steeple of a New England meeting house.\"\r\n\r\nThe climax of Birney's career in Kentucky had been reached in the\r\nearly part of 1835 when he split with the Kentucky Colonization\r\nSociety. Judge Underwood in the annual colonization address at\r\nFrankfort had attempted to show that the only way to exterminate\r\nslavery in the State was by African colonization. He advocated the\r\nexpenditure of $140,000 annually for the transportation of four\r\nthousand Negroes between the ages of seventeen and twenty. The plan if\r\nfollowed for fifty years he stated would rid the State of all\r\nslaves.[426] In a letter to Gerrit Smith on January 31, 1835, Birney\r\nvoiced his opposition to the plan of Judge Underwood and to any scheme\r\nof colonization. Thus on another point he was to be classed as a\r\nradical abolitionist and his career of usefulness in Kentucky was at\r\nan end. If he had chosen a more middle ground and aided the cause of\r\ncolonization, he would no doubt have accomplished much good. As it\r\nwas, he was forced to leave the State after many threats and\r\nthereafter he stormed the institution of slavery in his native State\r\nfrom a safe region north of the Ohio River. From that time on\r\neverything that he uttered in opposition to slavery in Kentucky was\r\nmet with a strong current of opposition. Where Birney might have\r\naccomplished much for his native State he really did harm because he\r\nwent beyond the point where the people would listen to his advice. In\r\nSeptember, 1834, he visited Henry Clay and that most liberal of all\r\nKentucky slaveholders pointed out to Birney the error of his ways but\r\nthe latter showed no signs of listening to advice and thereafter Clay\r\nand Birney were sworn political antagonists. Had Birney joined with\r\nClay at this time there might have been a much brighter future in\r\nKentucky for the cause of emancipation. As it was, Birney never\r\nreceded from his position and when the Presbyterian Synod came out\r\nwith its plan of gradual emancipation Birney voiced his determined\r\nopposition to the scheme because it did not favor the immediate\r\nliberation of the slaves.[427] With the advent of the abolition\r\nmovement most of the Kentucky masters who were in favor of gradual\r\nemancipation receded from their position and held on firmly to the\r\nexisting institution.[428]\r\n\r\nThe series of events from 1831 to 1835, centering around the\r\nactivities of Birney, brought the attention of the public to the\r\nslavery question more than ever. As was common in all other movements\r\nof popular interest it became the custom for local gatherings to be\r\nheld to discuss the problem. It was always customary at the conclusion\r\nof these meetings to draw up a series of resolutions and it is\r\nnoticeable that they all voiced a similarity of sentiment on the\r\nslavery question. A typical set of resolves were those drawn up at a\r\ngathering held in Shelbyville in June, 1835:\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, that the system of domestic slavery as it now exists\r\n     in this commonwealth, is both a moral and a political evil, and\r\n     in violation of the rights of man.\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, as the opinion of this meeting, that the additional\r\n     value which would be given to our property, and its products by\r\n     the introduction of free white labor, would in itself be\r\n     sufficient, under a system of gradual emancipation, to transport\r\n     the whole of our colored population.\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, that no system of emancipation will meet with our\r\n     approbation, unless colonization be inseparably connected with\r\n     it, and that any scheme of emancipation which will leave the\r\n     blacks within our borders, is more to be deprecated than slavery\r\n     itself.\"[429]\r\n\r\nThese resolutions were just another indication that the sentiment of\r\nthe people of Kentucky during the decade from 1830 to 1840 was in\r\nfavor of gradual emancipation of the slaves and their colonization in\r\nAfrica. We have seen that this was the plan of the various church\r\nbodies, and also of Kentucky's greatest statesman, Henry Clay. Added\r\nto this we find that the majority of the liberal-minded people of the\r\nState held to the same conviction. But why, one asks, did all this\r\nfeeling come to naught. The answer can be better expressed in the\r\nwords of a contemporary Kentuckian, Nathaniel Shaler: \"From the local\r\nhistories the deliberate student will easily become convinced that if\r\nthere had been no external pressure against slavery at this time there\r\nwould still have been a progressive elimination of the slave element\r\nfrom the population by emancipation on the soil, by the sale of slaves\r\nto the planters of the Southern States, and by their colonization in\r\nforeign parts.\"[430]\r\n\r\nDuring the decade from 1840 to 1850 this outside pressure of which\r\nShaler speaks was at its height. We have seen typical examples of it\r\nwithin the borders of Kentucky in the discussion of the cases of Delia\r\nWebster, Calvin Fairbank and John B. Mahan. The change in the trend of\r\npopular thought during this period does not show itself much in the\r\nopen until 1849, when the third constitutional convention was about to\r\nassemble. It was then that all phases of the problem of slavery were\r\ndiscussed, in the press, in the pulpit, on the platform and in the\r\nelections. George IX Prentice in an editorial gave the best exposition\r\nof Kentucky sentiment. He said: \"The sentiment of Kentucky we believe\r\nto be, that slavery is an evil which must be borne with patience,\r\nsimply because there is no known plan for its rapid extinction which\r\nwould not produce incalculable sacrifices and appalling risks. At the\r\nsame time we think the people of Kentucky are not inclined to increase\r\nthe evil, but are inclined to favor its gradual emancipation and\r\nremote termination, by prohibiting the further introduction of slaves\r\nand by some provision tending to encourage voluntary emancipation with\r\ncolonization. These measures they believe, taken in connection with\r\nthe known tendency in widening circles to substitute free for slave\r\nlabor, will hasten the social revolution in question as fast as it can\r\nbe carried with safety to the Commonwealth or with benefit to the\r\ncolonized negro.\"[431]\r\n\r\nSo universal was this feeling that even Cassius M. Clay, the only real\r\nabolitionist left in the State, came out more or less in favor of it.\r\nUnder his leadership there was held at Frankfort, April 25, 1849, an\r\nemancipation convention to which all the more radical element were\r\ninvited. Clay himself proved to be the most radical member of the\r\nconvention but when they came to draw up a series of resolutions the\r\nonly ones to pass were those which favored the absolute prohibition of\r\nthe importation of any more slaves into Kentucky and the complete\r\npower to enforce and perfect, under the new constitution, whenever the\r\npeople desired it, a system of gradual emancipation of the\r\nslaves.[432] Here we are confronted with the unusual fact that the\r\nradical element of the State agreed with the plan of George D.\r\nPrentice, one of the chief pro-slavery men of Kentucky, and with that\r\nof Henry Clay.\r\n\r\nWhile sojourning for his health in New Orleans in February, 1849, Clay\r\nsent Richard Pindell for publication a letter on the gradual\r\nemancipation of slavery in Kentucky, as the State at that time was\r\nabout to hold another constitutional convention. This long and able\r\ndocument constitutes the most constructive program for the progressive\r\nelimination of slavery from the State that was ever drawn up. It\r\nembodied not only the fundamental principles of Clay's attitude on the\r\nKentucky slavery question but it undoubtedly typified the real\r\nposition of the average high-minded Kentucky slaveholder of that day.\r\nClay frankly admitted that he had little hope of the immediate success\r\nof the plan, but he thought it was his duty to present the facts of\r\nthe problem to the people of his own State, at a time when they were\r\nabout to alter the existing constitution. The spirit of the plan as\r\nwell as its context shows that Clay had thoroughly considered the\r\nemancipation question from all aspects, especially in relation to its\r\npractical operation. The actual plan was based on three principles:\r\n(1) that any gradual emancipation should be slow in its operation, so\r\nas not to disturb the existing habits of society; (2) as an\r\nindispensable condition the liberated slaves were to be sent out of\r\nthe State and colonized in Africa; (3) and the expenses of their\r\ntransportation and six months subsistence were to be borne by a fund\r\nsupplied by the labor of the freed negro.\r\n\r\nRegarding the progressive plan of liberation, Clay suggested that a\r\ncertain date, January 1, 1855 or 1860, be fixed for the commencement\r\nof the plan. All slaves born after that date were to be free at the\r\nage of twenty-five; but they were liable thereafter to be hired out\r\nunder State authority for a period of not more than three years, in\r\norder to raise money to pay for their expenses of transportation to\r\ntheir colony and their subsistence for the term of six months. It was\r\nsuggested that the offspring of those who were to be free at\r\ntwenty-five should be free at their birth, but subject to\r\napprenticeship until they reached their majority and then to be hired\r\nout as in the case of the parent to pay the expenses of transportation\r\nto the colony and their settlement there. In the meanwhile the master\r\nwould have the usual legal rights over the slaves and could sell,\r\ndevise or remove them out of the State.\r\n\r\nClay considered colonization to be an indispensable part of his scheme\r\nand went so far as to say that he would be \"utterly opposed\" to any\r\nsystem of emancipation without it. He firmly believed that the nearly\r\ntwo hundred thousand blacks along with their descendants \"could never\r\nlive in peace and harmony and equality with the residue of the\r\npopulation\" if they were free. He thought the expense of colonizing\r\nshould be borne by a fund from the labor of the liberated Negro\r\nbecause he was the individual who secured the most benefit thereby.\r\nThe non-slaveholder should not be taxed for any share in the expense\r\nand the slaveholder would have enough sacrifices to make without any\r\nadditional financial burdens. Clay figured that the average annual\r\nhire of each slave would be about fifty dollars, or one hundred and\r\nfifty dollars for the whole period of three years. One third of this\r\nsum would be required for the transportation of the Negro to Africa\r\nand the other two thirds would go towards a fund to establish him in\r\nhis new country.[433]\r\n\r\nThe persistence of Clay in his avowed convictions on the subject of\r\nslavery and emancipation in Kentucky was kept up in spite of the fact\r\nthat within a few days after the publication of his plan of\r\nemancipation throughout Kentucky the House of Representatives at\r\nFrankfort by the unanimous vote of 93 to 0 declared that \"we the\r\nrepresentatives of the people of Kentucky, are opposed to abolition or\r\nemancipation of slavery in any shape or form whatever, except as now\r\nprovided by the laws and constitution of the state.\"[434] This was\r\ntheir answer to the plea set forth by Clay and strange to say the same\r\ngroup of men voted unanimously at the same session to return Clay for\r\nsix years more to the United States Senate.\r\n\r\nA convention of the so-called \"Friends of Constitutional Reform\" had\r\nbeen held at the State capital on February 5, 1849, and had drawn up a\r\nseries of twelve resolutions on the several questions which were to be\r\ndebated in the constitutional convention. They made mention\r\nincidentally of the desired reforms in connection with slavery stating\r\n\"that we do not desire or contemplate any change in the relative\r\ncondition of master and slave in the new Constitution, and intend a\r\nfirm and decided resistance to any such change. We have no objection\r\nto a proper provision for colonizing the present free blacks, and\r\nthose who shall hereafter be set free, but protest against abolition\r\nor emancipation without the consent of the owner, unless upon full\r\ncompensation and colonization.\"[435]\r\n\r\nThis element dominated the convention. The body not only ignored any\r\nplan of emancipation but drew the reins of the existing institution\r\ntighter than ever before by incorporating in the Bill of Rights the\r\nfamous phrase that \"the right of property is before and higher than\r\nany constitutional sanction, and the right of the owner of a slave to\r\nsuch slave and its increase is the same and as inviolable as the right\r\nof the owner of any property whatsoever.\" Such a statement was,\r\nhowever, not brought on by the words of Clay, but was a direct\r\nanswer to the \"higher law than the constitution\" plea of the\r\nabolitionists.[436] The convention amended the standard article on\r\nslavery with a section to the effect that the \"General Assembly should\r\npass laws providing that any free negro or mulatto immigrating to,\r\nand any slave thereafter emancipated in, and refusing to leave that\r\nState, should be deemed guilty of a felony, punished by confinement in\r\nthe penitentiary.\"\r\n\r\nThe obvious purpose of this amendment was to reduce the number of\r\nNegroes in the State. Accordingly every slave emancipated was forced\r\nto leave the State and the Negro population was decreased just so much\r\nevery time any slaves were set free. The convention was thus willing\r\nto do something towards eliminating the Negro, but was not in favor of\r\nany scheme of a general gradual liberation of the slaves. The\r\nnecessary legislative act for carrying out the provision of the\r\nconstitution was enacted March 24, 1851.[437] This law only went half\r\nway in that it only prevented those Negroes who had been freed in\r\nKentucky from living in the State. It was not until March 3, 1860,\r\nthat the prohibition was extended to all free Negro immigration into\r\nthe State.[438] An interesting development of this policy was shown in\r\nthe enactment of the legislature in 1863 which declared it unlawful\r\nfor any Negro or mulatto claiming to be free under the Emancipation\r\nProclamation to migrate to or remain in the State. Any Negro violating\r\nthis law was to be treated as a runaway slave.[439]\r\n\r\nThe desire of the State authorities to eliminate the free Negro was\r\naccompanied by constructive measures in behalf of the emancipated\r\nslave. On March 3, 1856, the State legislature passed a law\r\nappropriating $5,000 annually to aid the Kentucky Colonization Society\r\nin the transportation of free Negroes to Liberia.[440] The universal\r\nsentiment of the time was that the salvation of the Negro race rested\r\nin their elimination from the State even as free men and their\r\ntransportation to their native African soil. Henry Clay of all others\r\nwas the most persistent advocate of colonization.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the general trend of public opinion from about 1798\r\nhad been progressively in favor of gradual emancipation provided it\r\nwas coupled with some form of colonization which would remove the\r\nliberated Negroes from the State. Public sentiment, however, received\r\na serious set-back about 1838 with the beginning of the Underground\r\nRailroad system and the incoming of the abolitionist literature. In a\r\nspeech in the Kentucky legislature of 1838 James T. Morehead, one of\r\nthe leading anti-slavery statesmen of the State, portrayed the coming\r\nof the newer era in the history of Kentucky slavery when the people\r\nwould make more strenuous efforts to hold firmly to the slavery\r\ninstitution. Morehead pictured the popular mind in these words: \"Any\r\nman who desires to see slavery abolished--any friend of emancipation,\r\ngradual or immediate--- who supposes for a moment that now is the time\r\nto carry out this favorite policy, must be blind to the prognostics\r\nthat lower from every quarter of the political sky. Sir, the present\r\nis not the period to unmanacle the slave in this or any other state of\r\nthe Union. Four years ago you might have had some hope. But the wild\r\nspirit of fanaticism has done much to retard the work of emancipation\r\nand to rivet the fetters of slavery in Kentucky.... The advocates of\r\nabolition--the phrenzied fanatics of the North, neither sleep nor\r\nslumber. Their footsteps are even now to be seen wherever mischief can\r\nbe perpetrated--and it may be that while the people of Kentucky are\r\nreposing in the confidence of fancied security, the tocsin of\r\nrebellion may resound through the land--the firebrand of the\r\nincendiary may wrap their dwellings in flames--their towns and cities\r\nmay become heaps of ashes before their eyes and their minds drawn off\r\nfrom all thoughts of reforming the government to consider the means\r\nnecessary for their self-preservation--the protection of their\r\nfamilies and all that is dear to men.\"[441]\r\n\r\nSuch was the idea of one of the most prominent public men of Kentucky\r\nand such became in time the opinion of the average citizen who had\r\ncome to believe in gradual emancipation as the hope and solution of\r\nthe Negro problem in the State. The future course of events regarding\r\nslavery in Kentucky is to be explained by this radical change of\r\nmind. Thus did the wise and constructive plans of the gradual\r\nemancipationists come to naught with the incoming of the radical\r\nabolitionist movement which the Kentucky populace thought would bring\r\nabout a civil insurrection among the slaves in their own State. The\r\nabolitionists misunderstood the gradual emancipation movement in\r\nKentucky and really fanned the flame of the pro-slavery sentiment that\r\ncame in its place.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[397] Davidson, _History of the Presbyterian Church in Kentucky_, p.\r\n336.\r\n\r\n[398] _Minutes of Transylvania Presbytery_, Vol. 1, p. 147.\r\n\r\n[399] _Minutes of Transylvania Presbytery_, Vol. 2, pp. 102-3.\r\n\r\n[400] _Ibid._, Vol. 2, pp. 163, 224.\r\n\r\n[401] _Minutes W.

Clay made a rather lengthy speech to the\r\ngentleman on the general principles of the question and then, came\r\ndown to the practical side of the problem:\r\n\r\n\"Without any knowledge of the relation in which I stand to my slaves,\r\nor their individual condition, you, Mr. Mendenhall, and your\r\nassociates, who have been active in getting up this petition, call\r\nupon me forthwith to liberate the whole of them. Now let me tell you,\r\nthat some half a dozen of them, from age, decrepitude, or infirmity,\r\nare wholly unable to gain a livelihood for themselves, and are a heavy\r\ncharge upon me. Do you think that I should conform to the dictates of\r\nhumanity by ridding myself of that charge, and sending them forth into\r\nthe world with the boon of liberty, to end a wretched existence in\r\nstarvation? Another class is composed of helpless infants, with or\r\nwithout improvident mothers. Do you believe as a Christian, that I\r\nshould perform my duty toward them by abandoning them to their fate?\r\nThen there is another class who would not accept their freedom if I\r\nwould give it to them. I have for many years owned a slave that I\r\nwished would leave me, but he would not. What shall I do with that\r\nclass?\"\r\n\r\n\"What my treatment of my slaves is you can learn from Charles, who\r\naccompanies me on this journey, and who has traveled with me over the\r\ngreater part of the United States, and in both the Canadas, and has\r\nhad a thousand opportunities, if he had chosen to embrace them, to\r\nleave me. Excuse me, Mr. Mendenhall, for saying that my slaves are as\r\nwell fed and clad, look as sleek and hearty, and are quite as civil\r\nand respectful in their demeanor, and as little disposed to wound the\r\nfeelings of any one, as you are.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I shall, Mr. Mendenhall, take your petition into respectful and\r\ndeliberate consideration; but before I come to a final decision, I\r\nshould like to know what you and your associates are willing to do for\r\nthe slaves in my possession, if I should think proper to liberate\r\nthem. I own about fifty, who are probably worth about fifteen thousand\r\ndollars. To turn them loose upon society without any means of\r\nsubsistence or support would be an act of cruelty. Are you willing to\r\nraise and secure the payment of fifteen thousand dollars for their\r\nbenefit, if I should be induced to free them? The security of the\r\npayment of that sum would materially lessen the obstacle in the way of\r\ntheir emancipation.\"--Colton, Reed & McKinley, _Works of Henry Clay_,\r\nVol. 6, pp. 388-390.\r\n\r\nThis sums up in Clay's own words his treatment of the slaves that were\r\nunder his control. It is not to be presumed in any case that general\r\nconditions in the State were like this. There were obvious reasons why\r\nClay couldn't get one or two of his slaves to accept freedom when he\r\noffered it, for they realized that they were far better off under his\r\nown particular care than they could ever hope to be under an\r\nabsolutely free status in society.\r\n\r\n[421] So consistent was Clay in deed as well as words in spite of all\r\nthat the opposing forces had accomplished in the \"State of Kentucky\r\nthat when he died he left a will which did for his own slaves just\r\nwhat he would have had others do in his lifetime. As long as he lived\r\nhe refused to emancipate his slaves but when he passed away he left a\r\nwritten document, the following portion of which forms the eminent\r\nclimax to a career of continuous labors for the eventual good of the\r\nKentucky slave owners as well as the slaves themselves.\r\n\r\n\"In the sale of any of my slaves, I direct that members of families\r\nshall not be separated without their consent.\r\n\r\n\"My will is, and I accordingly direct, that the issue of all my female\r\nslaves, which shall be born after the first day of January, 1850,\r\nshall be free at the respective ages, of the males at twenty-eight,\r\nand of the females at twenty-five; and that the three years next\r\npreceding their arrival at the age of freedom, they shall be entitled\r\nto their hire or wages for those years, or of the fair value of their\r\nservices, to defray the expense of transporting them to one of the\r\nAfrican colonies and of furnishing them with an outfit on their\r\narrival there.\r\n\r\n\"And I further direct, that they be taught to read, to write, and to\r\ncipher, and that they be sent to Africa. I further will and direct,\r\nthat the issue of any of the females, who are so to be entitled to\r\ntheir freedom, at the age of twenty-five, shall be free at their\r\nbirth, and that they be bound out as apprentices to learn farming, or\r\nsome useful trade, upon the condition also, of being taught to read,\r\nto write, and to cipher. And I direct also, that the age of twenty-one\r\nhaving been attained, they shall be sent to one of the African\r\ncolonies, to raise the necessary funds for which purpose, if they\r\nshall not have previously earned them, they must be hired out for a\r\nsufficient length of time.\r\n\r\n\"I require and enjoin my executors and descendants to pay particular\r\nattention to the execution of this provision of my will. And if they\r\nshould sell any of the females who or whose issue are to be free, I\r\nespecially desire them to guard carefully the rights of such issue by\r\nall suitable stipulations and sanctions in the contract of sale. But I\r\nhope that it may not be necessary to sell any such persons who are to\r\nbe entitled to their freedom, but that they may be retained in the\r\npossession of some of my descendants.\"--Colton, Reed & McKinley, Vol.\r\n3, p. 153.\r\n\r\n[422] Birney, William, _James G.

Birney and his Times_, p. 156.\r\n\r\n[428] Quick to recognize this tendency, Clay referred to it in his\r\nSenate speech of February 7, 1839:\r\n\r\n\"The proposition in Kentucky for gradual emancipation did not prevail,\r\nbut it was sustained by a large and respectable minority. That\r\nminority had increased, and was increasing, until the abolitionists\r\ncommenced their operations. The effect has been to dissipate all\r\nprospects whatever, for the present, of any scheme of gradual or other\r\nemancipation. The people of that state have been shocked and alarmed\r\nby these abolition movements, and the number who would now favor a\r\nsystem even of gradual emancipation is probably less than it was in\r\nthe years 1798-9. At the session of the legislature held in 1837-8 the\r\nquestion of calling a convention was submitted to a consideration of\r\nthe people by a law passed in conformity with the Constitution of that\r\nstate. Many motives existed for the passage of the law, and among them\r\nthat of emancipation had its influence. When the question was passed\r\nupon by the people at their last annual election, only about one\r\nfourth of the whole voters of the state supported a call of a\r\nconvention. The apprehension of the danger of abolition was the\r\nleading consideration among the people for opposing the call. But for\r\nthat, but for the agitation of the question of abolition in states\r\nwhose population had no right, in the opinion of the people of\r\nKentucky, to interfere in the matter, the vote for a convention would\r\nhave been much larger, if it had not been carried.... Prior to the\r\nagitation of this subject of abolition, there was a progressive\r\nmelioration in the condition of the slaves--schools of instruction\r\nwere opened by humane and religious persons. These are now all\r\nchecked, and a spirit of insubordination having shown itself in some\r\nlocalities, traceable, it is believed, to abolition movements and\r\nexertions, the legislative authority has found it expedient to infuse\r\nfresh vigor into the police and the laws which regulate the conduct of\r\nthe slaves.\"--Colton, Reed & McKinley, _Works of Henry Clay_, Vol. 6,\r\npp. 153-154.\r\n\r\n[429] _Niles' Register_, July 4, 1835.\r\n\r\n[430] Shaler, N.

What\r\ngreat and beneficent enterprise was ever accomplished without risk and\r\nsacrifice! But these sacrifices are distant, contingent, and\r\ninconsiderable. Assuming the year 1860 for the commencement of the\r\nsystem, all slaves born prior to that time would remain such during\r\ntheir lives, and the present loss of the slaveholder would be only the\r\ndifference in value of the female slave whose offspring, if she had\r\nany, born after the first day of January, 1860, should be free at the\r\nage of twenty-five or should be slaves for life. In the meantime, if\r\nthe right to remove or sell the slave out of the State should be\r\nexercised, that trifling loss would not be incurred. The slaveholder,\r\nafter the commencement of the system, would lose the difference\r\nbetween the value of the slaves for life and slaves until the age of\r\ntwenty-five years. He might also incur some inconsiderable expense in\r\nrearing from their birth the issue of those who were to be free at\r\ntwenty-five, until they were old enough to be apprenticed out; but as\r\nit is probable that they would be most generally bound to him, he\r\nwould receive some indemnity from their services until they attained\r\ntheir majority.\"\r\n\r\n[434] Collins, _History of Kentucky_, Vol. 1, p. 58.\r\n\r\n[435] _Niles' Register_, February 21, 1849.\r\n\r\n[436] We know how Clay felt about this matter, for he referred to it\r\nat length in his speech in the Senate on February 20, 3850, in the\r\ndebate on the Compromise resolutions. Speaking particularly of his\r\nletter of emancipation he declared: \"I knew at the moment that I wrote\r\nthat letter in New Orleans, as well as I know at this moment, that a\r\nmajority of the people of Kentucky would not adopt my scheme, or\r\nprobably any project whatever of gradual emancipation. Perfectly well\r\ndid I know it; but I was anxious that, if any of my posterity, or any\r\nhuman being who comes after me, should have occasion to look into my\r\nsentiments, and ascertain what they were on this great institution of\r\nslavery; to put them on record then; and ineffectual as I saw the\r\nproject would be, I felt it was a duty which I owed to myself, to\r\ntruth, to my country, and to my God, to record my sentiments. The\r\nState of Kentucky has decided as I anticipated she would do. I regret\r\nit; but I acquiesce in her decision.\" --Colton, Reed & McKinley,\r\n_Works of Henry Clay_, Vol. 3, p. 353\r\n\r\n[437] Collins, _History of Kentucky_, Vol. 1, p. 61.\r\n\r\n[438] _Ibid._, Vol. 1, p. 83.\r\n\r\n[439] Session Laws of 1863, p. 366.\r\n\r\n[440] _Ibid._, 1856, Vol. 1, p. 50.\r\n\r\n[441] _Maysville Eagle_, April 11, 1838.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK REVIEWS\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Negro in Literature and Art._ By BENJAMIN BRAWLEY. Duffield and\r\nCompany, New York, 1918. Pp. 176. Price $1.25.\r\n\r\nThis is an effort to put in succinct form an estimate of the Negro's\r\nefforts in the creative world. The style of the book is largely\r\nbiographical. The opening chapter deals with Negro genius. Then around\r\nsuch Negroes as Phyllis Wheatley, Paul Laurence Dunbar, Charles W.\r\nChestnutt, W. E. B. DuBois, William Stanley Braithwaite, Meta Warrick\r\nFuller, Henry O. Tanner, Frederick Douglass, and Booker T. Washington\r\nare grouped most of the facts as to the achievements of the Negroes in\r\nart, literature, and science. In the appendix there is a dissertation\r\non the Negro in American fiction. A helpful bibliography and a short\r\nindex are also added.\r\n\r\nThis book is unique in that it is the first work devoted exclusively\r\nto this aspect of Negro history. It undertakes \"to treat somewhat more\r\nthoroughly than has ever before been attempted the achievement of the\r\nNegro in the United States along literary and artistic lines, judging\r\nthis by absolute rather than by partial or limited standards.\" The\r\nwork is the result of studies begun by the author years ago and\r\npublished in booklet form in 1910 as _The Negro in Literature and\r\nArt_. The substance of this treatise is found also in Professor\r\nBrawley's _A Short History of the American Negro_. Certain articles\r\nincluded therein have already been published in the _Springfield\r\nRepublican_, _The Southern Workman_, and the _Dial_. The appearance of\r\nthis work in the new form is justified by the author on the ground\r\nthat the constantly increasing material in this field has so changed\r\nhis viewpoint that the time seemed ripe for a more intensive review.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the author is a lofty one. Here we see the effort to\r\ninform the public that there is among Negroes a growing scholarship\r\nwhich must be reckoned with in determining the thought of this\r\ncountry. It is to convince the public that the Negro mind is\r\nfunctioning along all lines of thought known to other races of\r\nachievement. The purpose, too, is to set forth to Negroes examples of\r\nsuccessful men and women in this field to serve them as an incentive\r\nto contribute to thought. Professor Brawley has, therefore, written an\r\ninteresting book which should attract all persons desiring to\r\nunderstand those forces at work in the Negro mind and the manner in\r\nwhich they have found expression.\r\n\r\n                                   C.

Price 50 cents.\r\n\r\nThe unique features of Natalie Curtis Burlin's notation of Negro\r\nfolk-songs, collected in the South, are their complete truth to the\r\noriginal folk-song, spirit and letter. The spontaneous part-singing of\r\ngroups of Negroes is a rare phenomenon in folk-music, for most simple\r\npeople sing only a unisono melody. Mrs. Curtis Burlin, unlike most\r\nformer collectors, has recorded not only the melody and words, but the\r\nwhole _choral_ folk-song, as sung in the South, with all its different\r\nvoices. To secure entire accuracy in so difficult a task, a phonograph\r\nwas used and the work was mainly accomplished in all its wealth of\r\noctave at Hampton Institute, Virginia, under the auspices of which the\r\ncollection was undertaken and for the benefit of which the\r\npublications are made. Not content with a by-ear approximation only of\r\nthe folk-song, Mrs. Burlin gave especial care to the notation of every\r\nnuance of Negro singing--organic and rhythmic. The changing nuance\r\nsyncopations that give such expressive accent to the different solo\r\nverses sung by the Negro \"leader\" have all been caught and put upon\r\npaper. Doctor Talcott Williams, of the New York School of Journalism,\r\nsays that the example of this reverent and scholarly work marks a new\r\nera in the collecting of Negro folk-music in this country.\r\n\r\nThe words of the songs--true folk-poems--have been noted in dialect\r\nwith the same truth to Negro rendering as the music. Furthermore, the\r\nsyllables stressed in the music are stressed in the written poem as\r\nwell; for in the mind of the Negro authors, words and music were one\r\nspontaneous creation, and it is the _music_ that gives to the words\r\nthe accent, instead of the words forming the basis of the accentuation\r\nof the music, as with us. This reproduction in verse of the original\r\nNegro rhythms which are full of unexpected emphasis and captivating\r\nsyncopation forms a new departure in the manner of writing Negro poems\r\nand it is believed that modern poets and writers of vers libre will\r\nfind interest in the richness and variety of Negro rhythms here shown.\r\n\r\nEach song is prefaced by a few paragraphs of descriptive text and the\r\ndedications of the different records to men who have helped to advance\r\nthe Negro summarize, in a sense, the progress of the race since\r\nemancipation.\r\n\r\nThe recording of Negro folk-songs was prefaced by Mrs. Burlin by a\r\nyear's study of the native music of Africa. Doubleday, Page & Co. will\r\nbring out in the autumn her book entitled _Songs From the Dark\r\nContinent_, containing the results of careful study of native\r\nfolk-lore and music told and sung by two African boys (one a Zulu and\r\nthe other from the Ndan tribe) who had come directly to Hampton\r\nInstitute from the Dark Continent. This book plainly proves the\r\nrelationship of American Negro music to its parent stem in Africa, and\r\nreveals the poetic as well as musical gifts latent in the black race.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Black Man's Part in the War._ By SIR H. H. JOHNSTON. Simpkin\r\nMarshall, London, 1917.\r\n\r\nTaking into consideration that the United Kingdom now rules 50,000,000\r\nof Africans who are well represented in the battle line by the\r\nthousands of Negroes fighting to make democracy safe in the world of\r\nthe white man, from which the blacks are excluded, this sympathetic\r\nwriter here endeavors to give these soldiers of color credit for their\r\nunselfish services. The highest tribute which he pays them is that\r\ntheir loyalty is incontestable. The writer, therefore, makes an appeal\r\nin behalf of safeguarding their interests and reasonably preserving\r\ntheir independence after the war. Having in mind the new alignments of\r\ntrade, he sees the Africans as the producers of the tropical products\r\nwhich white men will need. Their future loyalty in the competitive\r\ncommercial world after the war is also necessary to the salvation of\r\nthe English people in the tropics and at home.\r\n\r\nThe writer believes too that to secure this necessary loyalty the\r\nnatives must be given political recognition. The rights of the black\r\nman as a citizen of the empire must be affirmed wherever the\r\nterritories have been under British rule long enough to acquire a very\r\nBritish tone in language, education and ideals. He hopes also that the\r\npresent tendency of the natives of the late German possessions to\r\nprefer the rule of the British to that of their former masters may be\r\nfurther accentuated by the efforts of Englishmen to treat these\r\nnatives with more consideration. The writer advocates also a fair\r\ndivision of land where the two races are brought into contact with\r\neach other as in Rhodesia.\r\n\r\nTo strengthen the claims he makes for the recognition of the black man\r\nthe writer has well illustrated his book with plates showing the\r\nadvancement of Negroes to arouse interest in their behalf. The book\r\nis, of necessity, incomplete, as the war has not yet ended; but, on\r\nthe whole, students of Negro life and history will find it profitable\r\nto read this broad enlightened working program for changing the white\r\nman's attitude toward a large part of the human family which not only\r\nhas done him no great wrong, but has borne his burdens when he has\r\nbeen about to fall beneath the load.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_History of the Civil War._ By JAMES FORD RHODES, LL.D., D.Litt.\r\nMcMillan Company, New York. 1861-1865. Pp. 454.\r\n\r\nMr. Rhodes has covered this ground in detail in his _History of the\r\nUnited States_ in seven volumes. But this work is not an abridgment of\r\nthe three volumes of that history dealing with the Civil War. Since\r\nwriting his first history he has had access to much new material and\r\nmany valuable treatments of certain periods of the Civil War. He has,\r\ntherefore, considered it necessary to bring out this new volume that\r\nhe may show the bearing of these new facts on his grasp of this period\r\nof our history.\r\n\r\nInfluenced by the dominant thought of the present war, Mr. Rhodes\r\ntreats such conditions as unpreparedness, the privations of the war,\r\nlack of tea and coffee, the lack of bread and meat, the difficulty of\r\ntransportation, conscription, high prices, loans, high taxation, and\r\nconsequent distress. The Negroes are necessarily mentioned in the\r\ndiscussion of slavery in the territories, the attempted slavery\r\ncompromises, Lincoln's handling of the question, the effect on them of\r\nthe movements of the armies, and the efforts at emancipation leading\r\nup to the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment. Mention is also\r\nmade of the conduct of the slaves who accompanied the Confederates and\r\nof those who followed and fought with the Union army.\r\n\r\nMr. Rhodes is here at his best, that is, when writing on the Civil\r\nWar. But this seems to be mere chance. He writes a good history of the\r\nCivil War because he happens to be a Unionist, and no one has yet\r\nproved that the Union cause was wrong. He is after all an\r\nimpressionable historian, accepting almost anything he picks up, but\r\nembellishing it so well as to win the American public, whose\r\nscholarship has not yet performed the task of publishing an authentic\r\nhistory of the Civil War from the viewpoint of treating the records\r\nscientifically. When Rhodes elsewhere takes up the Negro in the\r\nReconstruction he shows his lack of ability as an historian in\r\naccepting almost everything which he has heard or read about the Negro\r\nand in branding, therefore, as mistakes and failures all of the\r\nefforts to elevate the Negro to the dignity of citizenship and to deal\r\nwith him as a human being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Bernard Hartgrove, one of the five members who participated in\r\nthe organization of the Association for the Study of Negro Life and\r\nHistory in Chicago in 1915, died at Albuquerque, New Mexico, on the\r\ntwenty-fourth of April. In his death the Association lost a\r\nsubstantial supporter and friend. He was an unselfish, wide-awake and\r\nenterprising teacher, endeavoring always to be instrumental in the\r\nuplift of the Negro. During the last ten years of his life he devoted\r\nmuch of his time and means to the work of the National Association for\r\nthe Advancement of Colored People, serving the local branch most of\r\nthat period as secretary. When the Association for the Study of Negro\r\nLife and History was organized he was among the first to see its\r\npossibilities and to give it financial as well as moral support. He\r\nmade himself useful in assisting the editor in his arduous duties\r\nduring the days when the work was in the making. He contributed to the\r\nJOURNAL OF NEGRO HISTORY, moreover, a number of articles, among which\r\nare: _The Story of Maria Louise Moore and Fannie M. Richards_, _The\r\nNegro Soldier in the American Revolution_, and _The Story of Josiah\r\nHenson_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMention of the slave Archy in Miss Beasley's _Slavery in California_\r\nhas called forth from a relative of his the following short sketch:\r\n\r\nArchy's mother was named Maria. Maria had four children: Archy,\r\nCandace, Pompey and Quitman. (I am the daughter of Candace.) At the\r\ntime Charles A. Stoval took Archy to California, Maria with her other\r\nchildren were with Simeon Stoval, the father of Chas. A. Stoval.\r\n\r\nChas. A. Stoval had been graduated in medicine and had returned home\r\nto begin practice, but his health having failed him, he went to\r\nCalifornia, taking my Uncle Archy with him. My grandmother Maria heard\r\nthrough the relatives of Stoval of Archy during the time Stoval\r\nremained in California. But near the close of the Civil War, Chas. A.\r\nStoval returned to Mississippi and remained there until his death a\r\nfew years later. After Stoval came back from California, my\r\ngrandmother never heard any more of her son Archy, except when she\r\nonce heard that he was with the Indians, who were treating him for\r\nsome kind of sickness. Whether he died or whether this rumor was put\r\nout to keep the Stovals from trying to steal him and bring him back to\r\nMississippi I have never been able to learn. My grandmother Maria\r\ncontinued to search for Archy, by writing several times to San\r\nFrancisco, but without success. She died in 1884. Pompey and Quitman\r\ncontinued to live near Jackson, Miss., where Quitman died some time\r\nago. Pompey was still alive when I last heard of him.\r\n\r\n                                   MRS. R. A.

III--OCTOBER, 1918--NO. 4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNINGS OF THE MISCEGENATION OF THE WHITES AND BLACKS\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough science has uprooted the theory, a number of writers are\r\nloath to give up the contention that the white race is superior to\r\nothers, as it is still hoped that the Caucasian race may be preserved\r\nin its purity, especially so far as it means miscegenation with the\r\nblacks. But there are others who express doubt that the integrity of\r\nthe dominant race has been maintained.[442] Scholars have for\r\ncenturies differed as to the composition of the mixed breed stock\r\nconstituting the Mediterranean race and especially about that in Egypt\r\nand the Barbary States. In that part of the dark continent many\r\ninhabitants have certain characteristics which are more Caucasian than\r\nnegroid and have achieved more than investigators have been willing to\r\nconsider the civilization of the Negro. It is clear, however, that\r\nalthough the people of northern Africa cannot be classed as Negroes,\r\nbeing bounded on the south by the masses of African blacks, they have\r\nso generally mixed their blood with that of the blacks that in many\r\nparts they are no nearer to any white stock than the Negroes of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThis miscegenation, to be sure, increased toward the south into\r\ncentral Africa, but it has extended also to the north and east into\r\nAsia and Europe. Traces of Negro blood have been found in the Malay\r\nStates, India and Polynesia. In the Arabian Peninsula it has been so\r\nextensive as to constitute a large group there called the Arabised\r\nNegroes. But most significant of all has been the invasion of Europe\r\nby persons of African blood. Professor Sergi leads one to conclude\r\nthat the ancient Pelasgii were of African origin or probably the\r\ndescendants of the race which settled northern Africa and southern\r\nEurope, and are therefore due credit for the achievements of the early\r\nGreek and Italian civilizations.[443]\r\n\r\nThere is much evidence of a further extension of this infusion in the\r\nMediterranean world.\r\n\r\n     \"Recent discoveries made in the vicinity of the principality of\r\n     Monaco and others in Italy and western France,\" says MacDonald,\r\n     \"would seem to reveal ... the actual fact that many thousand\r\n     years ago a negroid race had penetrated through Italy into\r\n     France, leaving traces at the present day in the physiognomy of\r\n     the peoples of southern Italy, Sicily, Sardinia and western\r\n     France, and even in the western parts of the United Kingdom of\r\n     Great Britain and Ireland. There are even at the present day some\r\n     examples of the Keltiberian peoples of western Scotland, southern\r\n     and western Wales, southern and western Ireland, of distinctly\r\n     negroid aspect, and in whose ancestry there is no indication\r\n     whatever of any connection with the West Indies or with Modern\r\n     Africa. Still more marked is this feature in the peoples of\r\n     southern and western France and of the other parts of the\r\n     Mediterranean already mentioned.\"[444]\r\n\r\nBecause of the temperament of the Portugese this infusion of African\r\nblood was still more striking in their country. As the Portugese are a\r\ngood-natured people void of race hate they did not dread the\r\nmiscegenation of the races. One finds in southern Portugal a \"strong\r\nMoorish, North African element\" and also an \"old intermixture with\r\nthose Negroes who were imported thither from Northwest Africa to till\r\nthe scantily populated southern provinces.\"[445] This miscegenation\r\namong the Portugese easily extended to the New World. Then followed\r\nthe story of the Caramarii, the descendants of the Portugese, who\r\nafter being shipwrecked near Bahia arose to prominence among the\r\nTupinambo Indians and produced a clan of half-castes by taking to\r\nhimself numerous native women.[446] This admixture served as a\r\nstepping stone to the assimilation of the Negroes when they came.\r\n\r\nThere immigrated later into Brazil other settlers who, mixing eagerly\r\nwith the Amerindians, gave rise to a race called Mamelucos who began\r\nto mix maritally with the imported Negro women. The French and Dutch\r\ntoo in caring for their offspring by native women promoted the same.\r\n\"They educated them, set them free, lifted them above servitude, and\r\nraised them socially to the level of the whites\"[447] so that today\r\ngenerally speaking there are no distinctions in society or politics in\r\nBrazil. Commenting on this condition in Brazil, Agassiz said: \"This\r\nhybrid class, although more marked here because the Indian is added,\r\nis very numerous in all cities; perhaps, the fact, so honorable to\r\nBrazil, that the free Negro has full access to all privileges of any\r\nfree citizen, rather tends to increase than to dimmish that number.\"\r\nAfter emancipation in Brazil in 1888, the already marked tendency\r\ntoward this fusion of the slave and the master classes gradually\r\nincreased.[448]\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards mixed less freely with the Negroes than did the\r\nPortugese but mixed just the same. At first they seriously considered\r\nthe inconveniences which might arise from miscegenation under frontier\r\nconditions and generally refrained from extensive intermingling. But\r\nmen are but men and as Spanish women were far too few in the New\r\nWorld at that time, the other sex of their race soon yielded to the\r\ncharms of women of African blood. The rise of the mixed breeds too\r\nfurther facilitated the movement. Spaniards who refused to intermingle\r\nwith the blacks found it convenient to approach the hybrids who showed\r\nless color. In the course of time, therefore, the assimilation of the\r\nblacks was as pronounced in some of the Spanish colonies as in those\r\nwhich originally exhibited less race antipathy. There are millions of\r\nHispanicized Negroes in Latin America. Many of the mixed breeds,\r\nhowever, have Indian rather than Negro blood.[449]\r\n\r\nMiscegenation had its best chance among the French. Not being\r\ndisinclined to mingle with Negroes, the French early faced the problem\r\nof the half caste, which was given consideration in the most human of\r\nall slave regulations, the _Code Noir_.[450] It provided that free men\r\nwho had children from their concubinage with women-slaves (if they\r\nconsented to such concubinage) should be punished by a fine of two\r\nthousand pounds of sugar. But if the offender was the master himself,\r\nin addition to the fine, the slave should be taken from him, sold for\r\nthe benefit of the hospital and never be allowed to be freed;\r\nexcepting, that, if the man was not married to another person at the\r\ntime of his concubinage, he was to marry the woman slave, who,\r\ntogether with her children, should thereby become free. Masters were\r\nforbidden to constrain slaves to marry against their will. Many\r\nFrenchmen like those in Haiti married their Negro mistresses,\r\nproducing attractive half caste women who because of their wealth were\r\nsought by gentlemen in preference to their own women without dot.\r\n\r\nAmong the English the situation was decidedly different. There was not\r\nso much need for the use of Negro women by Englishmen in the New\r\nWorld, but there was the same tendency to cohabit with them. In the\r\nend, however, the English, unlike the Latins, disowned their offspring\r\nby slave women, leaving these children to follow the condition of\r\ntheir mother. There was, therefore, not so much less miscegenation\r\namong the English but there remained the natural tendency so to\r\ndenounce these unions as eventually to restrict the custom, as it is\r\ntoday, to the weaker types of both races, the offspring of whom in the\r\ncase of slave mothers became a commodity in the commercial world.\r\n\r\nThere was extensive miscegenation in the English colonies, however,\r\nbefore the race as a majority could realize the apparent need for\r\nmaintaining its integrity. With the development of the industries came\r\nthe use of the white servants as well as the slaves. The status of the\r\none differed from that of the other in that the former at the\r\nexpiration of his term of service could become free whereas the latter\r\nwas doomed to servitude for life. In the absence of social\r\ndistinctions between these two classes of laborers there arose\r\nconsiderable intermingling growing out of a community of interests. In\r\nthe colonies in which the laborers were largely of one class or the\r\nother not so much of this admixture was feared, but in the plantations\r\nhaving a considerable sprinkling of the two miscegenation usually\r\nensued.\r\n\r\nThe following, therefore, was enacted in Maryland in 1661 as a\r\nresponse to the question of the council to the lower house as to what\r\nit intended should become of such free women of the English or other\r\nChristian nations as married Negroes or other slaves.[451] The\r\npreamble reads: \"And forasmuch as divers freeborn _English_ women,\r\nforgetful of their free condition, and to the disgrace of our nation,\r\ndo intermarry with negro slaves,[452] by which also divers suits may\r\narise, touching the issue of such women, and a great damage doth\r\nbefall the master of such negroes, for preservation whereof for\r\ndeterring such free-born women from such shameful matches, _be it\r\nenacted_: That whatsoever free-born woman shall intermarry with any\r\nslave, from and after the last day of the present assembly, shall\r\nserve the master of such slave during the life of her husband; and\r\nthat all the issues of such free-born women, so married, shall be\r\nslaves as their fathers were.\" \"And be it further enacted: That all\r\nthe issues of _English_, or other free-born women, that have already\r\nmarried negroes, shall serve the master of their parents, till they be\r\nthirty years of age and no longer.\"[453]\r\n\r\nAccording to A. J. Calhoun, however, all planters of Maryland did not\r\nmanifest so much ire because of this custom among indentured servants.\r\n\"Planters, said he, \"sometimes married white women servants to Negroes\r\nin order to transform the Negroes and their offspring into\r\nslaves.[454] This was in violation of the ancient unwritten law that\r\nthe children of a free woman, the father being a slave, follow the\r\nstatus of their mother and are free. The custom gave rise to an\r\ninteresting case. \"Irish Nell,\" one of the servants brought to\r\nMaryland by Lord Baltimore, was sold by him to a planter when he\r\nreturned to England. Following the custom of other masters who held\r\nwhite women as servants, he soon married her to a Negro named Butler\r\nto produce slaves. Upon hearing this, Baltimore used his influence to\r\nhave the law repealed but the abrogation of it was construed by the\r\nCourt of Appeals not to have any effect on the status of her offspring\r\nalmost a century later when William and Mary Butler sued for their\r\nfreedom on the ground that they descended from this white woman. The\r\nProvincial Court had granted them freedom but in this decision the\r\nCourt of Appeals reversed the lower tribunal on the ground that \"Irish\r\nNell\" was a slave before the measure repealing the act had been\r\npassed. This case came up again 1787 when Mary, the daughter of\r\nWilliam and Mary Butler, petitioned the State for freedom. Both\r\ntribunals then decided to grant this petition.[455]\r\n\r\nThe act of repeal of 1681, therefore, is self explanatory. The\r\npreamble reads: \"Forasmuch as, divers free-born _English_, or white\r\nwomen, sometimes by the instigation, procurement or connivance of\r\ntheir masters, mistresses, or dames, and always to the satisfaction of\r\ntheir lascivious and lustful desires, and to the disgrace not only of\r\nthe _English_, but also of many other Christian nations, do intermarry\r\nwith Negroes and slaves, by which means, divers inconveniences,\r\ncontroversies, and suits may arise, touching the issue or children of\r\nsuch free-born women aforesaid; for the prevention whereof for the\r\nfuture, _Be it enacted_: That if the marriage of any woman-servant\r\nwith any slave shall take place by the procurement of permission of\r\nthe master, such woman and her issue shall be free.\" It enacted a\r\npenalty by fine on the master or mistress and on the person joining\r\nthe parties in marriage.[456]\r\n\r\nThe effect of this law was merely to prevent masters from prostituting\r\nwhite women to an economic purpose. It did not prevent the\r\nmiscegenation of the two races. McCormac says: \"Mingling of the races\r\nin Maryland continued during the eighteenth century, in spite of all\r\nlaws against it. Preventing marriages of white servants with slaves\r\nonly led to a greater social evil, which caused a reaction of public\r\nsentiment against the servant. Masters and society in general were\r\nburdened with the care of illegitimate mulatto children, and it became\r\nnecessary to frame laws compelling the guilty parties to reimburse the\r\nmasters for the maintenance of these unfortunate waifs.\"[457] To\r\nremedy this laws were passed in 1715 and 1717 to reduce to the status\r\nof a servant for seven years any white man or white woman who\r\ncohabited with any Negro, free or slave. Their children were made\r\nservants for thirty-one years, a black thus concerned was reduced to\r\nslavery for life and the maintenance of the bastard children of women\r\nservants was made incumbent upon masters. If the father of an\r\nillegitimate child could be discovered, he would have to support his\r\noffspring. If not this duty fell upon the mother who had to discharge\r\nit by servitude or otherwise.[458]\r\n\r\nAs what had been done to prevent the admixture was not sufficient, the\r\nMaryland General Assembly took the following action in 1728:\r\n\r\n     \"Whereas by the act of assembly relating to servants and slaves,\r\n     there is no provision made for the punishment of free mulatto\r\n     women, having bastard children by negroes and other slaves, nor\r\n     is there any provision made in the said act for the punishment of\r\n     free negro women, having bastard children by white men; and\r\n     forasmuch as such copulations are as unnatural and inordinate as\r\n     between white women and negro men, or other slaves.\r\n\r\n     \"_Be it enacted_, That from and after the end of this present\r\n     session of assembly, that all such free mulatto women, having\r\n     bastard children, either within or after the time of their\r\n     service, (_and their issue_,) shall be subject to the same\r\n     penalties that white women and their issue are, for having\r\n     mulatto bastards, by the act, entitled, An act relating to\r\n     servants and slaves.\r\n\r\n     \"_And be it further enacted, by the authority aforesaid, by and\r\n     with the advice and consent aforesaid_, that from and after the\r\n     end of this present session of assembly, that all free negro\r\n     women, having bastard children by white men, (_and their issue_,)\r\n     shall be subject to the same penalties that white women are, by\r\n     the act aforesaid, for having bastards by negro men.\"[459]\r\n\r\nVirginia which faced the same problem did not lag far behind Maryland.\r\nIn 1630 the Governor and Council in Court ordered Hugh Davis to be\r\nsoundly whipped before an assembly of Negroes and others for abusing\r\nhimself to the dishonor of God and shame of a Christian by defiling\r\nhis body in lying with a Negro, which he was to acknowledge next\r\nSabbath day. In 1662 the colony imposed double fines for fornication\r\nwith a Negro, but did not restrict intermarriage until 1691.[460] The\r\nwords of the preamble give the reasons for this action. It says:\r\n\r\n     \"And for the prevention of that abominable mixture and spurious\r\n     issue which hereafter may increase in this dominion, as well by\r\n     negroes, mulattoes, and Indians intermarrying with English, or\r\n     other white women, as by their unlawful accompanying with one\r\n     another, _Be it enacted by the authoritie aforesaid, and it is\r\n     hereby enacted_, That for the time to come, whatsoever English or\r\n     other white man or woman being free shall intermarry with a\r\n     negro, mulatto, or Indian man or woman bond or free shall within\r\n     three months after such marriage be banished and removed from\r\n     this dominion forever, and that the justices of each respective\r\n     countie within this dominion make it their perticular care, that\r\n     this act be put in effectuall execution.\"\r\n\r\nIf any free English woman should have a bastard child by any Negro or\r\nmulatto, she should pay the sum of fifteen pounds sterling, within one\r\nmonth after such bastard child should be born, to the church wardens\r\nof the parish where she should be delivered of such child, and in\r\ndefault of such payment she should be taken into the possession of the\r\nsaid church wardens and disposed of for five years, and such bastard\r\nchild should be bound out as a servant by the church wardens until he\r\nor she should attain the age of thirty years, and in case such English\r\nwoman that should have such bastard child be a servant, she should be\r\nsold by the church wardens (after her time is expired that she ought\r\nby law to serve her master) for five years, and the money she should\r\nbe sold for divided as before appointed, and the child should serve as\r\naforesaid.[461]\r\n\r\nIt was further provided in 1753 that if any woman servant should have\r\na bastard child by a Negro or mulatto, over and above the year's\r\nservice due to her master or owner, she should immediately upon the\r\nexpiration of her time, to her then present master, or owner, pay down\r\nto the church wardens of the parish wherein such child should be born\r\nfor the use of the said parish, fifteen pounds current money of\r\nVirginia, or be sold for five years to the use aforesaid; and if a\r\nfree Christian white woman should have such bastard child by a Negro,\r\nor mulatto, for every such offence, she should within one month after\r\nher delivery of such bastard child, pay to the church wardens for the\r\ntime being, of the parish wherein such child should be born, for the\r\nuse of the said parish, fifteen pounds current money of Virginia, or\r\nbe by them sold for five years to the use aforesaid; and in both the\r\nsaid cases, the church wardens should bind the said child to be a\r\nservant until it should be of thirty-one years of age.\r\n\r\nAnd for a further prevention of that \"abominable mixture, and the\r\nspurious issue, which may hereafter increase in this his majesty's\r\ncolony and dominion as well by English, and other white men and women,\r\nintermarrying with Negroes or mulattoes, as by their unlawful coition\r\nwith them\" it was enacted that whatsoever English, or other white man\r\nor woman, being free, should intermarry with a Negro, or mulatto man\r\nor woman bond or free, should by judgment of the county court, be\r\ncommitted to prison and there remain during the space of six months,\r\nwithout bail or main-prize, and should forfeit and pay ten pounds\r\ncurrent money of Virginia, to the use of the parish as aforesaid. It\r\nwas further enacted that no minister of the Church of England, or\r\nother minister or person whatsoever, within that colony and dominion,\r\nshould thereafter presume to marry a white man with a Negro, or\r\nmulatto woman, or to marry a white woman with a Negro or mulatto man,\r\nupon pain of forfeiting and paying for every such marriage, the sum of\r\nten thousand pounds of tobacco.[462]\r\n\r\nIt developed later that these laws did not meet all requirements, for\r\nthere were in subsequent years so many illegitimate children born of\r\nsuch mothers that they became a public charge.[463] Those of Negro\r\nblood were bound out by law. According to Russell, \"In 1727 it was\r\nordered that David James a free negro boy, be bound to Mr. James Isdel\r\n'who is to teach him to read ye bible distinctly also ye trade of a\r\ngunsmith that he carry him to ye Clark's office & take Indenture to\r\nthat purpose.' \"By the Warwick County court it was 'ordered that\r\nMalacai, a mulatto boy, son of mulatto Betty be, by the Church Wardens\r\nof this Parish bound to Thomas Hobday to learn the art of a planter\r\naccording to law.' By order of the Norfolk County court, about 1770, a\r\nfree negro was bound out 'to learn the trade of a tanner.'\"[464]\r\n\r\nIn making more stringent regulations for servants and slaves, North\r\nCarolina provided in 1715 that if a white servant woman had a child by\r\na Negro, mulatto or Indian, she must serve her master two years extra\r\nand should pay to the Church wardens immediately on the expiration of\r\nthat time six pounds for the use of the parish or be sold four years\r\nfor the use aforesaid.[465] A clergyman found guilty of officiating at\r\nsuch a marriage should be fined fifty pounds. This law, according to\r\nBassett, did not succeed in preventing such unions. Two ministers were\r\nindicted within two years for performing such a marriage ceremony. \"In\r\none case the suit was dropped, in the other case the clergyman went\r\nbefore the Chief Justice and confessed as it seems of his own\r\naccord.... In 1727 a white woman was indicted in the General Court\r\nbecause she had left her husband and was cohabiting with a negro\r\nslave.... So far as general looseness was concerned this law of 1715\r\nhad no force. Brickell, who was a physician, says that white men of\r\nthe colony suffered a great deal from a malignant kind of venereal\r\ndisease which they took from the slaves.\"[466]\r\n\r\nBy the law of 1741 therefore the colony endeavored to prevent what the\r\nGeneral Assembly called \"that abominable mixture and spurious issue,\r\nwhich hereafter may increase in this government, by white men and\r\nwomen intermarrying with Indians, Negroes, mustees, or mulattoes.\" It\r\nwas enacted that if any man or woman, being free, should intermarry\r\nwith an Indian, Negro, mustee or mulatto man or woman, or any person\r\nof mixed blood, to the third generation, bond or free, he should, by\r\njudgment of the county court forfeit and pay the sum of fifty pounds,\r\nproclamation money, to the use of the parish.[467] It was also\r\nprovided that if any white servant woman should during the time of her\r\nservitude, be delivered of a child, begotten by any Negro, mulatto or\r\nIndian, such servant, over and above the time she was by this act to\r\nserve her master or owner for such offence, should be sold by the\r\nChurch wardens of the parish, for two years, after the time by\r\nindenture or otherwise had expired.[468]\r\n\r\nThe miscegenation of the whites and blacks extended so widely that it\r\nbecame a matter of concern to the colonies farther north where the\r\nNegro population was not considerable. Seeking also to prevent this\r\n\"spurious mixt issue\" Massachusetts enacted in 1705 that a Negro or\r\nmulatto man committing fornication with an \"English woman, or a woman\r\nof any other Christian nation,\" should be sold out of the province.\"\r\n\"An English man, or man of any other Christian nation committing\r\nfornication with a Negro or mulatto woman,\" should be whipped, and the\r\nwoman sold out of the province. None of her Majesty's English or\r\nScottish subjects, nor of any other Christian nation within that\r\nprovince should contract matrimony with any Negro or mulatto, under a\r\npenalty imposed on the person joining them in marriage. No master\r\nshould unreasonably deny marriage to his Negro with one of the same\r\nnation; any law, usage or custom to the contrary notwithstanding.[469]\r\n\r\nThere was much social contact between the white servants and the\r\nNegroes in Pennsylvania, where the number of the latter greatly\r\nincreased during the first quarter of the nineteenth century. Turner\r\nsays a white servant was indicted for this offence in Sussex County in\r\n1677 and a tract of land there bore the name of \"Mulatto Hall.\"[470]\r\nAccording to the same writer Chester County seemed to have a large\r\nnumber of these cases and laid down the principle that such admixture\r\nshould be prohibited,\r\n\r\n     \"For that hee,\" referring to a white man, \"Contrary to his\r\n     Masters Consent hath ... got wth child a certaine molato wooman\r\n     Called Swart anna.\" \"David Lewis Constable of Haverford Returned\r\n     a Negro man of his And a white woman for having a Bastard Childe\r\n     ... the Negroe said she Intised him and promised him to marry\r\n     him: she being examined, Confest the same: the Court ordered that\r\n     she shall receive Twenty one lashes on her bare Backe ... and the\r\n     Court ordered the negroe never more to meddle with any white\r\n     woman more uppon paine of his life.\"[471]\r\n\r\nAdvertising for Richard Molson in Philadelphia in 1720, his master\r\nsaid, \"He is in company with a white woman named Mary, who is supposed\r\nnow goes for his wife\"; \"and a white man named Garrett Choise, and\r\nJane his wife, which said white people are servants to some neighbors\r\nof the said Richard Tilghman.\"[472] In 1722 a woman was punished for\r\nabetting a clandestine marriage between a white woman and a Negro. In\r\nthe _Pennsylvania Gazette_, June 1, 1749, appeared the notice of the\r\ndeparture of Isaac Cromwell, a mulatto, who ran away with an English\r\nservant woman named Anne Greene.[473]\r\n\r\nThe Assembly, therefore, upon a petition from inhabitants inveighing\r\nagainst this custom enacted a prohibitory law in 1725. This law\r\nprovided that no minister, pastor or magistrate or other person\r\nwhatsover who according to the laws of that province usually joined\r\npeople in marriage should upon any pretence whatever join in marriage\r\nany Negro with any white person on the penalty of one hundred pounds.\r\nAnd it was further enacted that if any white man or woman should\r\ncohabit or dwell with any Negro under pretense of being married, such\r\nwhite man or woman should be put out of service as above directed\r\nuntil they come to the age of thirty-one years; and if any free Negro\r\nman or woman should intermarry with a white man or woman, such Negro\r\nshould become a slave during life to be sold by order of the justice\r\nof the quarter sessions of the respective county; and if any free\r\nNegro man or woman should commit fornication or adultery with any\r\nwhite man or woman, such Negro or Negroes should be sold as a servant\r\nfor seven years and the white man or woman should be punished as the\r\nlaw directs in cases of adultery or fornication.[474]\r\n\r\nThis law seemed to have very little effect on the miscegenation of the\r\nraces in certain parts. In Chester County, according to the records of\r\n1780, mulattoes constituted one fifth of the Negro population.[475]\r\nFurthermore, that very year when the State of Pennsylvania had grown\r\nsufficiently liberal to provide for gradual emancipation the law\r\nagainst the mingling of the races was repealed. Mixed marriages\r\nthereafter became common as the white and the blacks in the light of\r\nthe American Revolution realized liberty in its full meaning. Thomas\r\nBranagan said:\r\n\r\n     \"There are many, very many blacks who ... begin to feel\r\n     themselves consequential, ... will not be satisfied unless they\r\n     get white women for wives, and are likewise exceedingly\r\n     impertinent to white people in low circumstances.... I solemnly\r\n     swear, I have seen more white women married to, and deluded\r\n     through the arts of seduction by negroes in one year in\r\n     Philadelphia, than for eight years I was visiting (West Indies\r\n     and the Southern States). I know a black man who seduced a young\r\n     white girl ... who soon after married him, and died with a broken\r\n     heart. On her death he said that he would not disgrace himself to\r\n     have a negro wife and acted accordingly, for he soon after\r\n     married a white woman. ... There are perhaps hundreds of white\r\n     women thus fascinated by black men in this city, and there are\r\n     thousands of black children by them at present.\"[476]\r\n\r\nA reaction thereafter set in against this custom during the first\r\ndecade of the nineteenth century, when fugitives in the rough were\r\nrushing to that State, and culminated in an actual campaign against it\r\nby 1820. That year a petition from Greene County said that many\r\nNegroes had settled in Pennsylvania and had been able to seduce into\r\nmarriage \"the minor children of the white inhabitants.\"[477] This\r\ncounty, therefore, asked that these marriages be made an offence\r\nagainst the laws of the State. Such a marriage was the cause of a riot\r\nin Columbia in 1834 and in 1838 the members of the Constitutional\r\nConvention engaged in a heated discussion of the custom.[478]\r\nPetitions were frequently sent to the legislature asking that this\r\nadmixture be penalized by law, but no such action was ever taken.\r\nRelying upon public opinion, however, the advocates of racial\r\nintegrity practically succeeded. Marriages of whites and blacks\r\neventually became so odious that they led to disturbances as in the\r\ncase of the riot of 1849, one of the causes of which was that a white\r\nman was living with a Negro wife.[479] This was almost ineffective,\r\nhowever, in the prevention of race admixture. Clandestine\r\nintermingling went on and tended to increase in enormous proportions.\r\nThe conclusive proof of this is that in 1860 mulattoes constituted one\r\nthird of the Negro population of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nPersons who professed seriously to consider the future of slavery,\r\ntherefore, saw that miscegenation and especially the general\r\nconnection of white men with their female slaves introduced a mulatto\r\nrace whose numbers would become dangerous, if the affections of their\r\nwhite parents were permitted to render them free.[480] The Americans\r\nof the future would thereby become a race of mixed breeds rather than\r\na white and a black population. As the lust of white persons for those\r\nof color was too strong to prevent this miscegenation, the liberty of\r\nemancipating their mulatto offspring was restricted in the slave\r\nStates but that of selling them remained.[481]\r\n\r\nThese laws eventually, therefore, had their desired effect. They were\r\nnever intended to prevent the miscegenation of the races but to debase\r\nto a still lower status the offspring of the blacks who in spite of\r\npublic opinion might intermarry with the poor white women and to leave\r\nwomen of color without protection against white men, who might use\r\nthem for convenience, whereas white women and black men would\r\ngradually grow separate and distinct in their social relations.\r\nAlthough thereafter the offspring of blacks and whites did not\r\ndiminish, instead of being gradually assimilated to the type of the\r\nCaucasian they tended to constitute a peculiar class commonly called\r\npeople of color having a higher social status than that of the blacks\r\nbut finally classified with all other persons of African blood as\r\nNegroes.\r\n\r\nWhile it later became a capital offence in some of the slave States\r\nfor a Negro man to cohabit with a white woman, Abdy who toured this\r\ncountry from 1833 to 1834 doubted that such laws were enforced. \"A\r\nman,\" said he, \"was hanged not long ago for this crime at New Orleans.\r\nThe partner of his guilt--his master's daughter--endeavored to save\r\nhis life, by avowing that she alone was to blame. She died shortly\r\nafter his execution.\"[482] With the white man and the Negro woman the\r\nsituation was different. A sister of President Madison once said to\r\nthe Reverend George Bourne, then a Presbyterian minister in Virginia:\r\n\"We Southern ladies are complimented with the name of wives; but we\r\nare only the mistresses of seraglios.\" The masters of the female\r\nslaves, however, were not always the only persons of loose morals.\r\nMany women of color were also prostituted to the purposes of\r\nyoung white men[483] and overseers.[484] Goodell reports a\r\nwell-authenticated account of a respectable Christian lady at the\r\nSouth who kept a handsome mulatto female for the use of her genteel\r\nson, as a method of deterring him, as she said, \"from indiscriminate\r\nand vulgar indulgences.\"[485] Harriet Martineau discovered a young\r\nwhite man who on visiting a southern lady became insanely enamored of\r\nher intelligent quadroon maid. He sought to purchase her but the owner\r\nrefused to sell the slave because of her unusual worth. The young\r\nwhite man persisted in trying to effect this purchase and finally\r\ninformed her owner that he could not live without this attractive\r\nslave. Thereupon the white lady sold the woman of color to satisfy the\r\nlust of her friend.[486]\r\n\r\nThe accomplishment of this task of reducing the free people of color\r\nto the status of the blacks, however, was not easy. In the first\r\nplace, so many persons of color had risen to positions of usefulness\r\namong progressive people and had formed connections with them that an\r\nabrupt separation was both inexpedient and undesirable. Exceptions to\r\nthe hard and fast rules of caste were often made to relieve the people\r\nof color. Moreover, the miscegenation of the races in the South and\r\nespecially in large cities like Charleston and New Orleans had gone to\r\nthe extent that from these centers eventually went, as they do now, a\r\nlarge number of quadroons and octoroons,[487] who elsewhere crossed\r\nover to the other race.\r\n\r\nWhite men ashamed of the planters who abused helpless black women are\r\nnow trying to minimize the prevalence of this custom. Such an effort,\r\nhowever, means little in the face of the facts that one seventh of the\r\nNegroes in the United States had in their veins any amount of\r\nCaucasian blood in 1860 and according to the last census more than one\r\nfifth of them have this infusion. Furthermore the testimony of\r\ntravelers in this country during the slavery period support the\r\ncontention that race admixture was common.[488]\r\n\r\nSo extensive did it become that the most prominent white men in the\r\ncountry did not escape. Benjamin Franklin seems to have made no secret\r\nof his associations with Negro women.[490] Russell connects many of\r\nthese cases with the master class in Virginia.[491] There are now in\r\nWashington Negroes who call themselves the descendants of two\r\nVirginians who attained the presidency of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe abolitionists made positive statements about the mulatto offspring\r\nof Thomas Jefferson. Goodell lamented the fact that Jefferson in his\r\nwill had to entreat the legislature of Virginia to confirm his bequest\r\nof freedom to his own reputed enslaved offspring that they might\r\nremain in the State of their nativity, where their families and\r\nconnections were.[492] Writing in 1845, the editor of the _Cleveland\r\nAmerican_ expressed regret that notwithstanding all the services and\r\nsacrifices of Jefferson in the establishment of the freedom of this\r\ncountry, his own son then living in Ohio was not allowed to vote or\r\nbear witness in a court of justice. The editor of the _Ohio Star_\r\nsaid: \"We are not sure whether this is intended as a statement of\r\nactual fact, or of what might possibly and naturally enough be true.\"\r\n_The Cincinnati Herald_ inquired: \"Is this a fact? If so, it ought to\r\nbe known. Perhaps 'the Democracy' might be induced to pass a special\r\nact in his favor.\" _The Cleveland American_, therefore, added: \"We are\r\ncredibly informed that a natural son of Jefferson by the celebrated\r\n'Black Sal,' a person of no little renown in the politics of 1800 and\r\nthereafter, is now living in a central county of Ohio. We shall\r\nendeavor to get at the truth of the matter and make public the result\r\nof our inquiries.\"[493]\r\n\r\nA later report of miscegenation of this kind was recorded by Jane Grey\r\nSwisshelm in her _Half a Century_, where she states that a daughter of\r\nPresident John Tyler \"ran away with the man she loved in order that\r\nshe might be married, but for this they must reach foreign soil. A\r\nyoung lady of the White House could not marry the man of her choice in\r\nthe United States. The lovers were captured and she was brought to His\r\nExcellency, her father, who sold her to a slave-trader. From that\r\nWashington slave-pen she was taken to New Orleans by a man who\r\nexpected to get twenty-five hundred dollars for her on account of her\r\ngreat beauty.[494]\r\n\r\n                                   CARTER G.

The\r\ndoctrine of the rights of man, which had swept over the world in the\r\nlatter part of the eighteenth century had had its effect on the\r\ncolonists and resulted in the manumission of many slaves. These\r\nfreedmen taking advantage of their economic and educational\r\nopportunities became an ever increasing menace to the social\r\ninstitutions that had no foundation except that of slavery. Ambitious,\r\noften aggressive, they were a constant source of dissatisfaction\r\nbecause of the unhappy comparison of their lot with that of the\r\nslaves. They, moreover, encouraged the slaves to improve their\r\ncondition and to escape to the North. This situation was rendered\r\nstill more critical for the reason that the South, considering slavery\r\nindispensable to its economic life, was already being lashed into a\r\nfrenzy to gain new slave territory and to strengthen the institution\r\nby every possible method of oppression of the blacks. Measures\r\ninimical to the economic progress of freedmen were enacted.[495] Many\r\nwho had been manumitted were seized and again reduced to slavery.\r\nEducational opportunities were restricted or denied. Legally they were\r\nwithout voice and hence could secure no redress when wronged.[496]\r\n\r\nThis economic poverty, insecurity of personal liberty, and absolutely\r\nnegative political status, impelled the freedmen to find better\r\nconditions in the North. The reaction against plantation life and the\r\nglittering attractions of the large city with the prospect of earning\r\nmoney less arduously no doubt account for their influx into the\r\nindustrial centers.[497] These free blacks migrated in great numbers\r\nespecially to New York and Philadelphia. The Colonization Society\r\nattempted to solve the problem by effecting the colonization of the\r\nfree Negroes somewhere either within or without the United States.\r\nMany friends of the Negroes and even some of the Negroes themselves\r\nthought favorably of the idea and a few small colonies were formed in\r\nthe Western States and in Liberia.[498]\r\n\r\nAmong the anti-slavery men who at first saw no fault in the aims of\r\nthe Colonization Society was Gerrit Smith. The son of a slave owner in\r\nthe State of New York, he was acquainted with slavery in the milder\r\nform in which it existed in the North. It was just two years before\r\nhis birth that the legislature of New York passed its act of\r\nemancipation providing that all children after the year 1799 should be\r\nfree, the males on reaching the age of twenty-eight years and the\r\nfemale twenty-five. His father, Peter Smith, was a slaveholder and the\r\nowner of extensive lands in the counties of northern New York; and\r\neven before his death the management of these vast properties devolved\r\nupon his son.\r\n\r\nHe soon became deeply interested in the uplift of the slaves and\r\nendeavored to improve their condition by gradual emancipation looking\r\nforward to colonization. As early as 1834, his diary shows a growing\r\nbelief in the universal right to liberty. Years ripened this belief\r\nand also developed his anti-land-monopolist principles, both of which\r\nreached fruition in his act of 1846, by which he gave away thousands\r\nof acres of land. He severed his connection with the Colonization\r\nSociety when that body overtly declared that it was not a society for\r\nthe abolition of slavery nor for the improvement of the blacks nor for\r\nthe suppression of the slave trade, and he threw his energy into the\r\nwork of abolition as fervently, if not as drastically, as\r\nGarrison.[499]\r\n\r\nAnti-land-monopolist as he was, Gerrit Smith believed that the life of\r\nthe small free farmer was calculated to develop thrift and self\r\nrespect in the character of the colored freedmen that he saw crowded\r\nin sections of the large cities. For although enjoying greater\r\nsecurity of personal liberty, the mass of colored people in New York\r\nState had not made much economic progress, even to the extent of\r\npossessing property valued at two hundred and fifty dollars, which in\r\nthat State would have entitled them to the right to vote.[500] He said\r\nthat he had for years indulged the thought that when he had sold\r\nenough land to pay his debts, he would give away the remainder to the\r\npoor. He was an Agrarian, who wanted every man desirous to own a farm\r\nto have one. He, therefore, felt that it was safe to make a beginning\r\nin the work of distributing land to individuals. He had theretofore\r\ngiven tracts of land to public institutions and a few small parcels to\r\nindividuals, but had not entered upon the larger task of making large\r\ndonations of land to the poor.\r\n\r\nHe then planned to transfer three thousand parcels of land of forty to\r\nsixty acres each during the following three years. To whom among the\r\npoor he should make these deeds, was a question he could not hastily\r\nsolve. He was sure, however, that, inasmuch as his home and the land\r\nwere both in the State of New York, it would be very suitable to\r\nselect his beneficiaries from among the people of that State. But for\r\na long time, he was at a loss to decide, whether to take his\r\nbeneficiaries generally from the meritorious poor or only from the\r\ndeserving Negroes. He said, \"I could not put a bounty on color. I\r\nshrank from the least appearance of doing so, and if I know my heart,\r\nit was equally compassionate toward such white and black men as are\r\nequal sufferers.\"[501] In the end, however, he concluded to confine\r\nhis gifts to Negroes.\r\n\r\nHe would not have come to this conclusion he said, if the land he had\r\nto give away had been several times as much as it was, nor if the\r\nNegroes, the poorest of the poor, had not been the most deeply wronged\r\nclass of the citizens. \"That they are so,\" said he, \"is evident, if\r\nonly from the fact, that the cruel, killing, Heaven-defying prejudice\r\nof which they are victims, has closed against them the avenues to\r\nriches and respectability--to happiness and usefulness. That they are\r\nso, is also evident from the fact, that, whilst white men in this\r\nState, however destitute of property, are allowed to vote for Civil\r\nRulers, every colored man in it who does not own landed estate to the\r\nvalue of two-hundred and fifty dollars, is excluded from the exercise\r\nof this natural and indispensably protective right.\"[502] He confessed\r\nthat he was influenced by the consideration that there was great\r\nencouragement to improve the condition of the Negroes, because every\r\namelioration in it contributed to loosen the bands of the enslaved\r\nportion of their outraged and afflicted race.\r\n\r\nHe, therefore, requested Reverend Theodore S. Wright, Reverend Charles\r\nB. Ray, and Dr. J. McCune Smith, three representative Negroes of New\r\nYork City, to make out a list of the Negroes who should receive from\r\nhim parcels of land. His only restrictions upon them in making this\r\nselection were that they should choose no person younger than\r\ntwenty-one and no person older than sixty; that they accept no person\r\nwho was in easy circumstances as to property; and no one who was\r\nalready the owner of land, and no drunkards.[503] He further promised\r\nto pay all taxes as well as purchase money and interest due to the\r\nState of New York hoping that none of the parcels would be sold for\r\nthe nonpayment of taxes.[504] The total number of colonists were to be\r\none thousand nine hundred and eighty-five, to be distributed as\r\nfollows: in the county of Suffolk, 127; Queens, 215; Kings, 197; New\r\nYork, 861; Richmond, 832; Rockland, 331; Westchester, 115; Dutchess,\r\n150; Sullivan, 5; Ulster, 106; Orange, 136; and Putnam, 10. Although\r\nthis distribution was suggested the actual grants seem to have been\r\nmade in the counties of Franklin, Essex, Hamilton, Fulton, Oneida,\r\nDelaware, Madison and Ulster.\r\n\r\nOn September 9, 1846, he wrote again to three gentlemen of color,\r\nsaying that a thousand of the deeds were already in the hands of the\r\ncommittee for distribution. He had saved them the expense of securing\r\nthe certificate of the County Clerk by having the acknowledgment of\r\nthe execution taken by a Supreme Court judge. The only expense left\r\nfor the beneficiaries to bear was the recording of the deed. The\r\nletter closed with a request that the three gentlemen prepare and send\r\nout a circular among the persons receiving the deeds, making known to\r\nthem the conditions and reasons which actuated him in bestowing the\r\nland. This was done and the recipients were exhorted to profit by the\r\nchance to become land owners and thereby secure their right to vote.\r\n\r\nThese lands, as Smith realized and admitted, were not all arable but\r\nmany of them had considerable timber. Such property today would be\r\nconsidered valuable, but in those days of plentitude it passed as\r\nundesirable. Some of his enemies accused him of making for himself a\r\nreputation for generosity by giving away useless land. There is no\r\nevidence, however, that such accusations were made by the\r\nNegroes.[505] But be that as it may, the experiment was a failure. It\r\nwas not successful because of the intractability of the land, the\r\nharshness of the climate, and in a great measure, the inefficiency of\r\nthe settlers. They had none of the qualities of farmers. Furthermore,\r\nhaving been disabled by infirmities and vices they could not as\r\nbeneficiaries answer the call of the benefactor. Peterboro, the town\r\nopened to Negroes in this section did maintain a school and served as\r\na station of the underground railroad but the agricultural results\r\nexpected of the enterprise never materialized.[506] The main trouble\r\nin this case was the impossibility of substituting something foreign\r\nfor individual enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the enterprise did not cause this philanthropist to\r\ncease his activities in behalf of freedom and justice to the Negroes.\r\nHe continued a staunch abolitionist, demanding unconditional\r\nemancipation of the slaves and leaving undone nothing which might\r\neffect this change. He was once intimately associated with John Brown,\r\nwho at one time left his home and purchased from Smith a farm in the\r\nNegro colony in order to live with the blacks and help them to improve\r\ntheir economic condition. Smith lived until 1874, long enough to see\r\nthe Negroes freed and many of them making elsewhere that economic\r\nprogress which was the dream of his earlier years.\r\n\r\n                                   ZITA DYSON\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[495] See the session laws of the State Legislatures, and Woodson's\r\n_Education of the Negro Prior to 1861_, pp. 151-178.\r\n\r\n[496] Goodell, _Slave Code_, and Hurd, _The Law of Freedom and\r\nBondage_, II, pp. 1-218.\r\n\r\n[497] Woodson, _A Century of Negro Migration_, Chapter II.\r\n\r\n[498] The JOURNAL OF NEGRO HISTORY, I, p. 276; II, p. 209.\r\n\r\n[499] Frothingham, _Gerrit Smith_, pp. 94-143.\r\n\r\n[500] Hurd, _Law of Freedom and Bondage_, II, p. 56.\r\n\r\n[501] Frothingham, _Gerrit Smith_, p. 103.\r\n\r\n[502] Frothingham, _Gerrit Smith_, 104.\r\n\r\n[503] _Letter of Gerrit Smith to Theodore S.

In\r\npopulation, material wealth and general organization it was\r\noutstanding, and the firm foundation upon which it was established is\r\nshown by the fact that today, more than half a century after\r\nemancipation, it is still a prosperous and distinctly Negro\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nThe western peninsula of Ontario, lying between Lakes Huron and Erie,\r\nwas long the Mecca of the fugitive slave. Bounded on the east by the\r\nState of New York, on the west by Michigan, and on the south by Ohio\r\nand northwestern Pennsylvania, this was the part of Canada most easily\r\nreached by the fugitive; and Niagara, Cleveland, Detroit and other\r\nlake ports saw thousands of refugees cross narrow strips of water to\r\n\"shake the lion's paw\" and find freedom in the British queen's\r\ndominions. During the forties and fifties there was a constant stream\r\nof refugees into Canada. As many as thirty in a day would cross the\r\nDetroit River at Fort Malden alone. Many of these went to the cities\r\nand towns, but others found greater happiness in the separate Negro\r\ncommunities which grew up here and there.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Buxton settlement, one of these, is closely linked\r\nwith the name of Rev. William King. King was a native of Londonderry,\r\nIreland, a graduate of Glasgow College, who had emigrated to the\r\nUnited States and become rector of a college in Louisiana. Later he\r\nreturned to Scotland, studied theology in the Free Church College,\r\nEdinburgh, and in 1846 was sent out to Canada as a missionary of the\r\nFree Church of Scotland. While he was living in Louisiana he became,\r\nthrough marriage, the owner of fifteen slaves of an estimated value\r\nof $9,000. For a time he placed them on a neighboring plantation and\r\ngave them the proceeds of their labor but that did not satisfy his\r\nconscience and in 1848 he brought them to Canada, thereby\r\nautomatically giving them their freedom. His effort on their behalf\r\ndid not end here. Having brought them to this new country, he felt it\r\na duty to look after them, to educate and make of them useful\r\ncitizens. The same thing, he believed, could be done for others in\r\nlike circumstance.\r\n\r\nThe first effort to secure a tract of land for the refugees was made\r\nby the Rev. Mr. King as the representative of the Presbyterian Church.\r\nThis application was before the Executive Council of the Canadian\r\nGovernment in September, 1848, but was not successful. Steps were at\r\nonce taken to organize a non-sectarian body to deal with the\r\ngovernment and this new body took the name of the Elgin Association in\r\nhonor of the then governor-general of the Canadas who seems to have\r\nbeen well disposed toward the refugees. The Elgin Association was\r\nlegally incorporated \"for the settlement and moral improvement of the\r\ncolored population of Canada, for the purpose of purchasing crown or\r\nclergy reserve lands in the township of Raleigh and settling the same\r\nwith colored families resident in Canada of approved moral\r\ncharacter.\"[507] Rev. Dr. Connor was the first president; Rev. Dr.\r\nWillis, of Knox College, Toronto, first vice-president, and Rev.\r\nWilliam King, second vice-president. J. T. Matthews was the secretary,\r\nJ. S. Howard, treasurer, while the original directors were E. A. T.\r\nMcCord, Walter McFarland, Peter Freland, Charles Bercsy, W. R. Abbott,\r\nJohn Laidlaw, E. F. Whittesend and James Brown. These are the names\r\nthat appear upon the petition to the government for lands, the\r\noriginal of which is in the Dominion Archives.\r\n\r\nThere were difficulties in securing the land. Decided opposition to\r\nthe whole project made itself manifest in Kent county.[508] In\r\nChatham, the county town, a meeting of protest was held. The plans of\r\nthe Elgin Association were condemned and a resolution was passed\r\nsetting forth objections to selling any of the public domain \"to\r\nforeigners, the more so when such persons belong to a different branch\r\nof the human family and are black.\" A vigilance committee was\r\nappointed to watch the operations of the Elgin Association while the\r\nvarious township councils interested were requested to advance the\r\nnecessary funds for carrying on the campaign. That there was some\r\ndissent, however, even in Chatham is shown by the fact that one Henry\r\nGouins was allowed to speak in favor of the Association. The vigilance\r\ncommittee soon issued a small pamphlet, made up chiefly of the\r\nspeeches and resolutions of the public meeting. The name of Edwin\r\nLarwill, member of Parliament for the county of Kent, appears as one\r\nof those most active in opposition to the settlement plan. Larwill had\r\na record for hostility to the colored people though at election times\r\nhe was accustomed to parade as their friend. In 1856 he introduced in\r\nthe House of Assembly a most insulting resolution[509] calling for a\r\nreport from the government on \"all negro or colored, male or female\r\nquadroon, mulatto, samboes, half breeds or mules, mongrels or\r\nconglomerates\" in public institutions. Larwill was at once called to\r\naccount for his action and a resolution was introduced calling upon\r\nhim to retract.\r\n\r\nThe opposition of Larwill and his supporters failed to impede the\r\nprogress of the Association and a tract of about 9000 acres, lying to\r\nthe south of Chatham and within a mile or two of Lake Erie, was\r\npurchased. This was surveyed and divided into small farms of fifty\r\nacres each, roads were cut through the dense forest and the first\r\nsettlers began the arduous work of clearing. The colonists were\r\nallowed to take up fifty acres each at a price of $2.50 per acre,\r\npayable in ten annual instalments.[510] Each settler was bound within\r\na certain period to build a house at least as good as the model house\r\nset up by the Association, to provide himself with necessary\r\nimplements and to proceed with the work of clearing land. The model\r\nhouse after which nearly all the dwellings were copied was 18 by 24\r\nfeet, 12 feet in height and with a stoop running the length of the\r\nfront. Some of the settlers were ambitious enough to build larger and\r\nbetter houses but there were none inferior to the model. The tract of\r\ncountry upon which the settlers were located was an almost unbroken\r\nforest. The ground was level, heavily timbered with oak, hickory,\r\nbeech, elm, etc. Part of the soil was a deep rich black loam. Trees\r\ntwo to four feet in diameter were common and the roads cut through to\r\nopen up settlement were hardly more than wide lanes. Rev. Mr. King\r\nthought that one reason for the colony's success was the fact that so\r\nmany of the settlers were good axe men. Their industry was remarkable\r\nand some of the more industrious paid for their land in five or six\r\nyears and took up more to clear.[511]\r\n\r\nThere are several contemporary references to the sobriety and morality\r\nof the colonists. The _New York Tribune_ correspondent in 1857 was\r\nable to report that liquor was neither made nor sold in the colony and\r\nthat drunkenness was unknown. There was no illegitimacy and there had\r\nbeen but one arrest for violation of the Canadian laws in the seven\r\nyears of the colony's history. Though the Presbyterian church gave\r\nspecial attention to the Buxton colony this did not hinder the growth\r\nof other sects, Methodists and Baptists both being numerous, though\r\nthe best of feeling seems to have prevailed and many who retained\r\ntheir own connection were fairly regular attendants at Mr. King's\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nThe _Tribune_ article gives an interesting description of the homes.\r\nThe cabins, though rough and rude, were covered with vines and\r\ncreepers with bright flowers and vegetable gardens round about.\r\nDespite the pioneer conditions there abounded comfort and plenty of\r\nplain homemade furniture. Pork, potatoes and green corn were staple\r\nitems of the menu. Of King's former slaves the _Tribune_ reports that\r\nthree had died, nine were at Buxton, one was married and living in\r\nChatham and two others in Detroit were about to return. The _Tribune_\r\nreports on one case as typical of what was being achieved by the\r\ncolony. A colored man, fourteen years before a slave in Missouri and\r\nwho had been at Buxton six years, reported that he had 24 acres out\r\nof his plot cleared, fenced and under cultivation. On six acres more\r\nthe trees were felled. He had paid four installments on his farm,\r\nowned a yoke of oxen, a wagon and a mare and two colts. His\r\nfourteen-year-old boy was at school and was reading Virgil. In the\r\nhome, besides bed and bedding, chairs and tables, there was a rocking\r\nchair and a large, new safe. Water was brought to the visitor in a\r\nclean tumbler, set upon a plate. A neighboring cabin had carpet on the\r\nfloor and some crude prints on the walls. All the cabins had large\r\nbrick fireplaces. Rev. Mr. King's own house, built of logs with high\r\nsteep roof, dormer windows and a porch the whole length, was somewhat\r\nlarger than the others.[512]\r\n\r\nWhat these people actually accomplished at Buxton amid conditions so\r\ndifferent from what they had known in the past is altogether\r\nremarkable. Some had known little of farm work before coming to the\r\ncolony while all of them must have found the Canadian climate\r\nsomething of a hardship even in the summer. Outside of the farm work\r\nthey showed ability as mechanics and tradesmen. One who visited them\r\nin the fifties says:[513]\r\n\r\n     \"The best country tavern in Kent is kept by Mr. West, at Buxton.\r\n     Mr. T. Stringer is one of the most enterprising tradesmen in the\r\n     county, and he is a Buxtonian, a colored man. I broke my carriage\r\n     near there. The woodwork, as well as the iron, was broken. I\r\n     never had better repairing done to either the woodwork or the\r\n     ironwork of my carriage, I never had better shoeing than was done\r\n     to my horses, in Buxton, in Feb., 1852, by a black man, a native\r\n     of Kentucky--in a word, the work was done after the pattern of\r\n     Charles Peyton Lucas. They are blessed with able mechanics, good\r\n     farmers, enterprising men, and women worthy of them and they are\r\n     training the rising generation to principles such as will give\r\n     them the best places in the esteem and the service of their\r\n     countrymen at some day not far distant.\"\r\n\r\nA few years sufficed to remove most of the prejudice that had shown\r\nitself in the opposition of the Larwill faction at Chatham at the\r\ninception of the colony. When Rev. S. R. Ward visited the colony in\r\nthe early fifties he found that instead of lowering land values of\r\nadjoining property as some had predicted would result from\r\nestablishing a Negro colony in Kent county, the Buxton settlement had\r\nactually raised the value of adjoining farms. The Buxton settlers were\r\nspoken of by the white people as good farmers, good customers and good\r\nneighbors. There were white children attending the Buxton school and\r\nwhite people in their Sunday church services.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no finer testimony to the success of the whole undertaking is\r\nrecorded than that of Dr. Samuel R. Howe who came to Canada for the\r\nFreedmen's Inquiry Committee.\r\n\r\n     \"Buxton is certainly a very interesting place,\" he wrote.\r\n     \"Sixteen years ago it was a wilderness. Now, good highways are\r\n     laid out in all directions through the forest, and by their side,\r\n     standing back 33 feet from the road, are about 200 cottages, all\r\n     built in the same pattern, all looking neat and comfortable;\r\n     around each one is a cleared place of several acres which is well\r\n     cultivated. The fences are in good order, the barns seem well\r\n     filled, and cattle and horses, and pigs and poultry, abound.\r\n     There are signs of industry and thrift and comfort everywhere;\r\n     signs of intemperance, of idleness, of want nowhere. There is no\r\n     tavern and no groggery; but there is a chapel and a schoolhouse.\r\n     Most interesting of all are the inhabitants. Twenty years ago\r\n     most of them were slaves, who owned nothing, not even their\r\n     children. Now they own themselves; they own their houses and\r\n     farms; and they have their wives and children about them. They\r\n     are enfranchised citizens of a government which protects their\r\n     rights.... The present condition of all these colonists as\r\n     compared with their former one is remarkable.... This settlement\r\n     is a perfect success. Here are men who were bred in slavery, who\r\n     came here and purchased land at the government price, cleared it,\r\n     bought their own implements, built their own houses after a model\r\n     and have supported themselves in all material circumstances and\r\n     now support their schools in part.... I consider that this\r\n     settlement has done as well as a white settlement would have\r\n     done under the same circumstances.\"[514]\r\n\r\nThe Buxton settlement had its part in the John Brown affair. A letter\r\nwritten by John Brown, Jr., from Sandusky, Ohio, August 27, 1859, and\r\naddressed to \"Friend Henrie,\" (Kagi), speaks of men in Hamilton,\r\nChatham, Buxton, etc., suitable for the enterprise.\r\n\r\n     \"At Dr. W's house (presumably in Hamilton) we formed an\r\n     association,\" he says, \"the officers consisting of chairman,\r\n     treasurer and corresponding secretary, the business of which is\r\n     to hunt up good workmen and raise the means among themselves to\r\n     send them forward.... No minutes of the organization nor any of\r\n     its proceedings are or will be preserved in writing. I formed\r\n     similar associations in Chat--and also at B-x-t-n.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Brown, Jr., also speaks of going to Buxton where he found \"the\r\nman, the leading spirit in that affair.\"\r\n\r\n     \"On Thursday night last\" said he, \"I went with him on foot 12\r\n     miles; much of the way through mere paths and sought out in the\r\n     bush some of the choicest. Had a meeting after ten o'clock at\r\n     night in his house. His wife is a heroine and he will be on hand\r\n     as soon as his family can be provided for.\"[515]\r\n\r\nSuch is the earlier history of the experiment in Canada of taking\r\nbondmen and placing before them the opportunity not alone to make a\r\nliving in freedom but also to rise in the social scale. How well these\r\npeople took advantage of their opportunity is shown not only by the\r\nmaterial progress they made but by the fact that they gained for\r\nthemselves the respect of their white neighbors, a respect that\r\ncontinues today for their many descendants who still comprise the\r\nBuxton community in Kent county, Ontario.\r\n\r\n                                   FRED LANDON\r\n\r\nPUBLIC LIBRARIAN, LONDON, CANADA, AND LECTURER IN AMERICAN HISTORY IN\r\nWESTERN UNIVERSITY, LONDON.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[507] Drew, _A North-Side View of Slavery_, 1856, p. 292.\r\n\r\n[508] Documents in Canadian Archives Department.\r\n\r\n[509] _Toronto Weekly Globe_, January 1, 1858.\r\n\r\n[510] Drew, _A North-Side View of Slavery_, 1856, pp. 292-293.\r\n\r\n[511] The slaves who had been freed by Mr. King formed the nucleus of\r\nthe colony but others came as soon as the land was thrown open. The\r\nadvances made by this colony during the first years of its existence\r\nwere remarkable. The third annual report for the year 1852, showed a\r\npopulation of 75 families or 400 inhabitants, with 350 acres of land\r\ncleared and 204 acres under cultivation. A year later, the fourth\r\nannual report showed 130 families or 520 persons, with 500 acres of\r\nland cleared and 135 partially cleared, 415 acres being under\r\ncultivation in 1853. The live stock was given as 128 cattle, 15\r\nhorses, 30 sheep and 250 hogs. The day school had 112 children\r\nenrolled and the Sabbath School 80.\r\n\r\nThe fifth report, for the year 1854, showed 150 families in the colony\r\nor immediately adjoining it, 726 acres of land cleared, 174 acres\r\npartially cleared and 577 acres under cultivation. In the year there\r\nhad been an increase of cleared land amounting to 226 acres and of\r\nland under cultivation of 162 acres. The livestock consisted of 150\r\ncattle and oxen, 38 horses, 25 sheep and 700 hogs. The day school had\r\n147 on the roll and the Sabbath School 120. A second day school was\r\nopened that year.\r\n\r\nThe sixth annual report (1855) shows 827 acres of land cleared and\r\nfenced and 216 acres chopped and to go under cultivation in 1856.\r\nThere were 810 acres cultivated that year while the live stock\r\nconsisted of 190 cattle and oxen, 40 horses, 38 sheep and 600 hogs.\r\nThe day school had an enrollment of 150. Among the advances of this\r\nyear was the erection of a saw and grist mill which supplied the\r\ncolony with lumber and with flour and feed. The building of the saw\r\nmill meant added prosperity, for an estimate made in 1854 placed the\r\nvalue of the standing timber at $127,000.\r\n\r\nA representative of the _New York Tribune_ visited the colony in 1857\r\nand his description of what he saw was reprinted in the _Toronto\r\nGlobe_ of November 20, 1857. The colony was then seven years old and\r\nhad a population of about 200 families or 800 souls. More than 1,000\r\nacres had been completely cleared while on 200 acres more the trees\r\nhad been felled and the land would be put under cultivation the next\r\nspring. The acreage under cultivation in the season of 1857 he gives\r\nas follows: corn, 354 acres; wheat, 200 acres; oats, 70 acres;\r\npotatoes, 80 acres; other crops, 120 acres. The live stock consisted\r\nof 200 cows, 80 oxen, 300 hogs, 52 horses and a small number of sheep.\r\nThe industries included a steam sawmill, a brickyard, pearl ash\r\nfactory, blacksmith, carpenter and shoe shops as well as a good\r\ngeneral store. There were two schools, one male and one female. The\r\nlatter, which had been open only about a year, taught plain sewing and\r\nother domestic subjects. The two schools had a combined enrollment of\r\n140 with average attendance of 58. It was being proposed to require a\r\nsmall payment in order to make the schools self-supporting. The\r\nSabbath school had an enrollment of 112 and an average attendance of\r\n52.--Drew, _A North-Side View of Slavery_, pp. 293-297.\r\n\r\n[512] _The New York Tribune._\r\n\r\n[513] Ward, _Autobiography of a Fugitive Negro_, 1855, p. 214.\r\n\r\n[514] Howe, _Refugees from Slavery in Canada West_, 1864, pp. 70-71.\r\n\r\n[515] _Toronto Weekly Globe_, November 4, 1859.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIFTY YEARS OF HOWARD UNIVERSITY[516]\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\n\r\nThe crisis in the financial affairs of the University, already\r\nmentioned, was the natural result of over confidence in the readiness\r\nof philanthropists to rally to the aid of a needy cause. This\r\ndisappointment, however, was a valuable experience, for it became\r\nclear that philanthropists were not inclined to grant very generous\r\naid to an institution established under the patronage of the Federal\r\nGovernment, especially in the face of the frequent and insistent\r\nappeals from less fortunate institutions serving the same people. It\r\nwas an incorrect assumption, however, that the United States Treasury\r\nwas paying the current expenses, for it must be remembered that no\r\npart of the original grants of the Freedmen's Bureau was or could be\r\ninvested as permanent endowment or used for salaries, equipment or\r\nmaintenance; and that during the first decade of the existence of the\r\nUniversity no public funds were appropriated for these purposes. In\r\nspite of this, its reputation as a ward of the United States\r\nGovernment was, to its great disadvantage, accepted by philanthropists\r\nas justified.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1873, the Freedmen's Bureau was abolished, General Howard\r\nresigned from the presidency of the University to enter the army. Not\r\ndesiring to accept his resignation immediately, however, the trustees\r\ngranted him an indefinite leave of absence.[517] At the same meeting\r\nit was decided to revive the office of Vice-President, which had been\r\ndiscontinued and John M. Langston, then Dean of the Howard Law School,\r\nwas elected to that position. \"It had been hoped,\" says one, \"that\r\nthe experiment of placing an able colored man in this high position\r\nwould stimulate his own race and the minds of white philanthropists to\r\nsustain the institution in its perilous struggles.\" But the lack of\r\nfunds continued. Convinced that a permanent president must be at once\r\nsecured, Mr. Langston resigned the vice-presidency in 1875.\r\n\r\nAn unfortunate combination of conditions that might well baffle the\r\nablest administrators then obtained. The outlook was so gloomy that it\r\nwas difficult to find a person both capable and willing to succeed to\r\nthe position left vacant. Upon Mr. Langston's resignation, Reverend\r\nGeorge Whipple, Secretary of the American Missionary Association was\r\nelected president but after due consideration declined the honor. On\r\nDecember 16, 1875, Edward P. Smith, a trustee of the University and a\r\nmember of the Executive Committee, was elected. After serving a few\r\nweeks he departed on an expedition for the American Missionary\r\nAssociation to the west coast of Africa where he died, June 15, 1875.\r\nMeanwhile Senator Pomeroy acted as chairman of the board of trustees\r\nand Professor Frederick W. Fairfield served efficiently as acting\r\npresident, having supervision over matters purely educational. This\r\nwas the period of the most rigid retrenchment in expenses.\r\n\r\nBut Howard was to find a way out of this difficulty and move onward.\r\nThe second epoch in the history of the University began when, on April\r\n25, 1876, the Reverend Doctor William W. Patton was elected president.\r\nHis administration, lasting over a term of twelve years, was a period\r\nof recovery and consolidation, and an era of good feeling. Dr. Patton\r\ncame to his task equipped with just the qualities needed at that time.\r\nHe possessed intense sympathy for the ideals for which the University\r\nstands; sufficient business ability to keep its finances safe; and a\r\npersonality that inspired respect, confidence and love.\r\n\r\nCarefully administering the affairs of the institution, Dr. Patton was\r\nable to restore confidence in the minds of the public and of Congress.\r\nThis accomplished, he was justified in arguing for federal aid on the\r\nground that through this means alone was it possible to make the best\r\nuse of the large and expensive plant which the Government had already\r\nprovided. The result was that for the year beginning July 1, 1879,\r\nCongress appropriated $10,000 toward current expenses. Since that date\r\nappropriations have been regularly made and have so increased that the\r\ninstitution now receives from the United States Government an annual\r\nallowance of over $100,000.\r\n\r\nIt was during the administration of Dr. Patton that Howard University\r\nrounded out its organization and developed as a university.\r\nPreviously, however, the various departments particularly had made\r\ninteresting history. An active faculty was organized in the Medical\r\nSchool, June 17, 1867, and the first session opened in November, 1868,\r\nin the same rented building already referred to as housing the first\r\nacademic classes of the University.[518] Here lectures were given in\r\nthe evening to a class of eight students. The permanent Medical\r\nBuilding was then in the course of erection. Under an able faculty and\r\nwith excellent facilities it is not surprising that the Medical School\r\nhas been able to maintain a very high standard of efficiency and that\r\nit now meets fully the requirements of the Association of American\r\nMedical Colleges.\r\n\r\nThe Law Department was organized October 12, 1868, with Mr. John M.\r\nLangston[519] as professor and dean. In December of the same year, A.\r\nG. Riddle was associated with him on the faculty and the school began\r\nactual instruction on January 6, 1869.[520] During the years of the\r\nfinancial difficulties of the University, however, the Law School\r\npassed through a distressing experience. The attendance of the\r\nstudents was uncertain, falling off rapidly when the Freedmen's Bureau\r\npassed out of existence; for many of the students who were employees\r\nserving the Bureau during the day attended lectures at night. These\r\nleft in large numbers when the Bureau closed, depriving the Law School\r\nof a part of its estimated income. Losing thus this revenue, this\r\ndepartment was either actually suspended or barely kept open with a\r\nsingle teacher and a handful of students. Mr. Langston retained his\r\nposition as dean under the then trying conditions until 1874, when he\r\nresigned.\r\n\r\nThe department gradually recovered with the mending fortunes of the\r\nUniversity under President Patton and as a result of the demand in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia for a school of law admitting students without\r\nracial restrictions. In 1881 B. F. Leighton was appointed to the\r\ndeanship of this department, a position which he has to the present\r\ntime filled with marked success. He took charge of the department when\r\nit was barely existing and brought it to its present position of\r\nusefulness. For many years he had associated with him A. A. Birney one\r\nof the most distinguished members of the District of Columbia bar.\r\nFrom that reconstruction of the department dates the period of its\r\nreal growth. In 1881 these two professors lectured to a class of seven\r\nstudents, five of whom were graduated at the close of the session.\r\nSince that time the courses have been broadened in keeping with the\r\nadvancing standards of legal study, the student body has increased ten\r\nfold and the faculty has been strengthened in accordance with these\r\ndemands.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Theological Department was the first in the plan of the\r\nfounders of the University, it was not put into operation until\r\nJanuary 6, 1868, when D. B. Nichols and E. W. Robinson, both\r\nclergymen, began without pay, to give theological instruction twice a\r\nweek to a number of men already accredited as preachers and others\r\nlooking forward to that work. Shortly afterwards, at the request of\r\nthe Board of Trustees, a course of study was drawn up and adopted.\r\nLectures in accordance with this plan were started immediately\r\nthereafter by General Eliphalet Whittlesey.[521] It was not until\r\n1871, however, that the Theological Department was officially\r\nannounced by the University as actively in operation. In this\r\nannouncement, Dr. John B. Reeve is named as dean, supported by a\r\nfaculty of four lecturers and a roster of twelve students. Three years\r\nlater in 1874, seven of these twelve students received their\r\ncertificates of graduation.\r\n\r\nThe Theological Department has always been barred from the use of\r\nUnited States funds for its current expenses and has, therefore,\r\ndepended upon scholarships and special contributions made by\r\nindividuals and philanthropic organizations. The American Missionary\r\nAssociation has always been its chief support since the crisis of\r\n1873. Because of the financial stress under which the University was\r\nworking at that time, the first act of Dr. Lorenzo Wescott, the new\r\ndean appointed in 1875, was to make arrangements to have the\r\nPresbytery of Washington assume the responsibility of the school. This\r\nappeal was favorably acted upon and a committee of the Presbytery took\r\ncharge of the affairs of the department in December, 1875. This step\r\nwas rendered necessary because, from 1872 to 1874 the American\r\nMissionary Association, on account of financial embarrassment, was\r\ncompelled, temporarily, to withdraw its support. In November, 1877,\r\nthis organization was again able to resume part of the responsibility\r\nand the bodies worked in harmony until June, 1887, when the American\r\nMissionary Association was again ready to bear the entire\r\nexpense.[522]\r\n\r\nDr. Patton resigned in May, 1889, but consented to continue in office\r\nuntil the end of the year or until his successor should be elected.\r\nThe selection of his successor was made in November and Dr. Patton\r\nretired, hoping to rest and do literary work. He died, however, on the\r\nlast day of the year 1889. On November 15, 1889, the trustees elected\r\nthe Reverend Doctor Jeremiah E. Rankin[523] to the presidency, taking\r\nhim from the pastorate of the First Congregational Church of\r\nWashington. His term of office extended through thirteen years, a\r\nperiod of slow but steady growth.\r\n\r\nUnder President Rankin other changes were made in the course of the\r\ndevelopment of the University. At the close of the session in 1899 the\r\nUniversity altered its policy with reference to the work of training\r\nteachers. To this end the work of the Normal Department, at first\r\nprovided for this purpose, was reorganized as the pedagogical\r\ndepartment of the college under the deanship of Professor Lewis B.\r\nMoore who had come to the faculty five years prior to this time from\r\nthe University of Pennsylvania, where he had pursued graduate studies\r\nand obtained the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. After several years\r\nof growth the department was designated as the Teachers College and\r\ngiven academic rank with the College of Arts and Sciences. When the\r\nNormal Department was discontinued the English Department was\r\nestablished to care for those who wished to pursue the common branches\r\nwithout professional aim. In 1903, it was merged with the newly\r\nestablished Commercial Department under Dean George W. Cook.\r\n\r\nIt was during this administration that with funds obtained as private\r\ndonations the permanent residence for the president and the Andrew\r\nRankin Memorial Chapel were erected, the former costing approximately\r\n$20,000 and the latter $22,000. The chapel is a memorial to the one\r\nwhose name it bears, Andrew E. Rankin, the brother of President Rankin\r\nand the deceased husband of Mrs. H. T. Cushman of Boston, a generous\r\ndonor toward its erection.\r\n\r\nBecause of failing health Doctor Rankin resigned in 1903. Reverend\r\nTeunis N. Hamlin, pastor of the Church of the Covenant, Washington,\r\nDistrict of Columbia, and the president of the board of trustees,\r\nserved as acting president for a short time pending the selection of a\r\npermanent incumbent. The Reverend Doctor John Gordon, the president of\r\nTabor College in Iowa was selected for the presidency and was formally\r\ninaugurated in 1904. It was hoped that the incoming president would\r\ninfuse new life into the institution, for the occasion demanded a\r\nsuccessful administrator, an efficient educator and a man able to\r\ncommand increased financial support for the institution. As Doctor\r\nGordon had none of these qualities, it soon became evident that he\r\nwould be able to accomplish little of benefit to the University. He\r\nfailed entirely to understand its mission and its ideals. Serious\r\nfriction between the president on the one hand and the faculty and\r\nstudents on the other grew to such proportions that Dr. Gordon, after\r\na term of office covering a little over two years, resigned.\r\n\r\nAfter an examination of available material in the search for a\r\nsuitable man for this position, the trustees were happy in the\r\nselection of the Reverend Doctor Wilbur P. Thirkield[524] who accepted\r\nthe offer and took up the duties of president in 1906. He was\r\ninaugurated November 15, 1907, on the occasion of the fortieth\r\nanniversary of the founding of the institution. With this ceremony\r\nbegan an infusion of new life into Howard University. Advantage of\r\nthis occasion was taken to introduce the institution concretely to a\r\ngroup of notables who had hitherto known of it only in a casual way.\r\nAnd having once brought the institution to the attention of the world,\r\nPresident Thirkield never allowed the world to forget it.\r\n\r\nWith keen insight he realized at the very beginning of his term of\r\noffice that the great and basic need of the University was material\r\nexpansion. He saw the need of a more extensive plant with modern\r\nequipment and served by a larger faculty. With characteristic energy\r\nhe sought to bring the University into a still closer alliance with\r\nthe Federal Government. So successfully was the case presented that\r\nduring his administration of six years he succeeded in raising the\r\nannual Congressional appropriation for current expenses from less than\r\n$50,000 in 1906 to over $100,000 in 1912. The pressing need for\r\nfacilities in the teaching of the sciences was met by the erection in\r\n1910 of a science hall from special appropriations amounting to\r\n$80,000.[525] In 1909, the Carnegie Library was erected. This building\r\nwas the gift of Mr. Andrew Carnegie and cost $50,000.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the improvement of the dormitories was begun by the\r\ninstallation of adequate systems of sanitary plumbing and electric\r\nlights. By arrangement with Freedmen's Hospital the heating and\r\nlighting plant was enlarged at a cost of approximately $100,000 to\r\nsuch capacity that steam and current were supplied to all the\r\nUniversity buildings. In addition to these improvements in housing and\r\nequipment, the grounds were improved and beautified in accordance with\r\na definite scheme.[526] To provide for the constantly growing work in\r\ntechnical and industrial branches the Hall of Applied Sciences was\r\nbuilt in 1913 at a cost of $25,000 thus releasing the old Spaulding\r\nHall for other purposes. A special department of music under Miss Lulu\r\nVere Childers was established in 1909 and given a building in 1916.\r\n\r\nPossibly the most striking result of the educational awakening under\r\nPresident Thirkield was the rapid growth of the College Department. In\r\n1876 for example, the roster of the department shows thirty-five\r\nstudents and four graduates. In 1907, forty years later, the\r\ncorresponding figures were, seventy-five and eight, a gain of about\r\none hundred per cent in forty years or two and a half per cent a year.\r\nIn 1911 these figures had grown to two hundred and forty-three, and\r\nthirty-one respectively, a gain during the period of six years covered\r\nby this administration, of about two hundred and forty per cent in\r\nstudents and nearly three hundred per cent in graduates. This is\r\napproximately a gain per year of forty per cent in enrollment and\r\nforty-eight per cent in graduates. While much of this remarkable\r\ngrowth is due to the general awakening of the University, yet no small\r\npart of the credit belongs to the inspiration of Professor Kelly\r\nMiller who became Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences in 1907\r\nnear the beginning of the period under consideration. Through his\r\nefforts and reputation as a writer the claims of the University and\r\nthe College of Arts and Sciences were brought to the attention of\r\naspiring youth throughout the country.[527] Upon the resignation of\r\nDr. Thirkield to become Bishop of the Methodist Church in 1912, the\r\nReverend Doctor Stephen M. Newman was chosen as the head of the\r\nuniversity. He has served in that position for five years.[528]\r\n\r\nServiceable as have been many of the educators connected with Howard\r\nUniversity it has had and still has many problems. Its chief\r\ndifficulty, however, is a financial one. Although it is impossible to\r\nfigure out how the University could have succeeded without the aid of\r\nthe United States Government, this connection of the institution has\r\nbeen in some respects a handicap. National aid seems to have\r\npermanently excluded the institution from the circle of the\r\nbeneficiaries of those great philanthropic agencies which have played\r\nsuch a prominent part in the support of education during the last half\r\ncentury. With the exception of the Theological Department, which\r\nreceives no part whatever of the Congressional appropriation, the\r\nincome to the institution from benevolent sources has played but a\r\nminor part in its development. On the other hand, the United States\r\nGovernment has never appropriated sufficient funds to maintain the\r\nUniversity as a first class institution. The present appropriation of\r\n$100,000 a year falls far short of what the school needs to function\r\nproperly. It seems, therefore, that the United States Government,\r\nshould adequately support the institution and make its appropriations\r\nlegally permanent.[529]\r\n\r\nSome remarks about the general policy of Howard University may be\r\nenlightening. The idea of racial representation among the\r\nadministrative officers and faculty is indicated by the fact that\r\nmembership in a particular race has never been considered a\r\nqualification for any position in the University. For many years the\r\nboard of trustees has had persons of both races as members. No colored\r\nman has served a regular term as president, however, unless we include\r\nthe short experience of Professor Langston already referred to. The\r\ntreasurer has always been white but the office of secretary has been\r\nfilled by members of both races. Neither the Theological nor the\r\nMedical School has had a Negro as dean although Dr. Charles B. Purvis\r\nwas elected to that office in the latter in 1900 but declined it.\r\n\r\nThe faculties of all departments are mixed, the proportion of Negroes\r\ngrowing as available material from which to choose becomes more\r\nabundant. The policy of maintaining mixed faculties, however, is not\r\ndictated entirely by the lack of men and women of color competent to\r\nfill all positions on the faculty; for today the supply of such\r\nmaterial is adequate. It seems that the governing body considers it in\r\nthe best interest of the University to preserve the racial mixture in\r\nthe offices and faculties in order that the students may receive the\r\npeculiar contribution of both races and that the institution may have\r\nits interests concretely connected with those of the dominant race.\r\n\r\nWhether or not Howard has amply justified its existence during its\r\nfirst half century; whether its ideals have been the best for the race\r\nwhose interests it primarily serves; whether its administrative\r\npolicies have been wise--these are questions whose answers lie outside\r\nthe scope of this sketch. As institutions of learning go, fifty years\r\nis a short time upon which to base conclusions. It is a period of\r\nbeginnings. With schools of the character of Howard, with its peculiar\r\nduties to perform and its peculiar problems to solve in a field\r\nentirely new, these fifty years make up a period of experiment.\r\nWhatever the future relative to this educational experiment may be,\r\nHoward has given to America nearly four thousand graduates from its\r\nvarious departments most of whom are now doing the class of work in\r\nall fields of endeavor which demand trained minds, broad human\r\nsympathy and the spirit of service.\r\n\r\n                                   DWIGHT O. W. HOLMES.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[516] Part I of _Fifty Years of Howard University_ appeared in the\r\nApril Number of the JOURNAL OF NEGRO HISTORY.\r\n\r\n[517] The resignation was accepted the following year after General\r\nHoward had been appointed to the command of the Department of the\r\nColumbia.\r\n\r\n[518] It was realized at the beginning that a hospital in connection\r\nwith the department was an absolute necessity. This was provided for\r\nthrough the relationship established between the Medical School and\r\nFreedmen's Hospital. The Campbell Hospital, as it was formerly called,\r\nwas located, at the close of the war, at what is now the northeast\r\ncorner of Seventh Street and Florida Avenue. Prior to that time it was\r\ndirectly connected with the War Department. In 1865, in connection\r\nwith the various hospitals and camps for freedmen in the several\r\nStates, it was placed under the Freedmen's Bureau. In 1869 it was\r\nmoved to buildings expressly erected for it by the Bureau upon ground\r\nbelonging to the University on Pomeroy Street, including and adjacent\r\nto the site of the Medical Building. This new home consisted of four\r\nlarge frame buildings of two stories each to be used as wards; and in\r\naddition the Medical Building itself, a brick structure of four and\r\none half stories, quite commodious and well arranged with lecture\r\nhalls and laboratories for medical instruction. Dr. Robert Reyburn,\r\nwho was chief medical officer of the Freedmen's Bureau from 1870 to\r\n1872 was surgeon in chief, from 1868 to 1875. He was followed in order\r\nby Drs. Gideon S. Palmer, Charles B. Purvis, Daniel H. Williams,\r\nAustin M. Curtis and Wm. H. Warfield. Dr. Warfield, the present\r\nincumbent was appointed in 1901 and is the first graduate of the\r\nHoward University Medical School to hold this position. Only the first\r\ntwo named, however, were white. In 1907 the hospital was moved to its\r\nnew home in the reservation lying on the south side of College Street\r\nbetween Fourth and Sixth Streets, the property of the University.\r\n\r\n\"The new Freedmen's Hospital was then built at a cost of $600,000. It\r\nhas the great advantage of being designed primarily for teaching\r\npurposes, as practically all the patients admitted are utilized freely\r\nfor instruction. The hospital has about three hundred beds and\r\ncontains two clinical amphitheatres, a pathological laboratory,\r\nclinical laboratory and a room for X-Ray diagnostic work and X-Ray\r\ntherapy. The Medical Faculty practically constitutes the Hospital\r\nStaff.\"--_Howard University Catalog_, 1916-17, p. 163; 1917-18, p.\r\n168.\r\n\r\n[519] Mr. Langston was graduated at Oberlin with the degree of A.B. in\r\n1852 and in theology in 1853. He studied law privately and was\r\nadmitted to practice in Ohio in 1854. In April, 1867, he was appointed\r\ngeneral inspector of the Freedmen's Bureau, serving for two years,\r\nduring which he travelled extensively through the South. From 1877 to\r\n1885 he was Minister to Haiti and from 1885 to 1887 President of the\r\nVirginia Normal and Collegiate Institute. He was elected to Congress\r\nfrom the Fourth District of Virginia and seated, September 23, 1890,\r\nafter a contest. He died November 15, 1897, at his home near Howard\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\n[520] For a number of years after its organization the school held its\r\nsessions in the main building of the University. Later a more\r\nconvenient location was secured in the building occupied by the Second\r\nNational Bank on Seventh Street. After remaining there for a\r\nconsiderable period, it moved to Lincoln Hall, at Ninth and D Streets,\r\nwhere it remained until 1887 when the building was destroyed by fire.\r\nThe authorities then decided to purchase for the department a\r\npermanent home conveniently located and adequate to its accommodation.\r\nAs a result the present Law Building on Fifth Street, opposite the\r\nDistrict Court House, was purchased, and fitted up for school\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n[521] General Eliphalet Whittlesey was Colonel of the 46th United\r\nStates Colored Regiment in 1865. He had been on the staff of General\r\nHoward during the last year of the campaign through the South and was\r\nbrevetted Brigadier General at the close of the war. He was Assistant\r\nCommissioner of the Freedmen's Bureau and later Adjutant General under\r\nGeneral Howard at Washington. He assisted in the selection of the site\r\nfor the University, was the first professor in the College Department\r\nand organized the Department of Theology.\r\n\r\nReverend Danforth B. Nichols, whose name has appeared frequently in\r\nthis sketch, was, at the close of the war, engaged in missionary work\r\namong the \"contrabands\" who tilled the abandoned lands just across the\r\nPotomac from Washington. When Howard University was founded he was one\r\nof the most active and enthusiastic workers for the successful\r\nlaunching of the venture. Beside being a founder, a trustee and a\r\nprofessor, he received the degree of M.D. with the first class\r\ngraduated by its medical department.\r\n\r\n[522] While the Presbytery was in charge the department received a\r\ngift or $5,000 from Mrs. Hannah B. Toland. In 1879 Reverend J. G.\r\nCraighead became dean of the department and filled the position until\r\nhis resignation in 1891. During his administration the department\r\nreceived $5,000 from the estate of Wm. E. Dodge of New York. On\r\nOctober 1, 1883, the treasurer of the University was authorized to pay\r\nthe American Missionary Association $15,000, \"out of moneys due from\r\nthe United States as compensation for University land taken for the\r\nreservoir,\" or such part as might be requisite to complete the\r\nendowment of the \"Stone Professorship\" in the Theological Department.\r\nThis amount was added to a fund of $25,000 which came from the estate\r\nof Daniel P. Stone, of Boston, Massachusetts, upon the fulfillment of\r\nthe term of the gift.\r\n\r\n[523] Dr. Rankin was a writer and poet of note, his most famous\r\nproduction being the hymn, \"God be with you till we meet again.\"\r\n\r\n[524] Dr. Thirkield received his A.M. degree from Ohio Wesleyan in\r\n1879. He studied theology at Boston University, graduating with the\r\ndegree of S.T.B. in 1881. He entered the ministry in the M. E. Church\r\nin 1878. As the first president of Gammon Theological Seminary,\r\nAtlanta, Georgia, from 1883 to 1899 he secured endowment for that\r\ninstitution to the amount of $600,000. He was called to the presidency\r\nof Howard after several years of successful service first as General\r\nSecretary of the Epworth League and later as General Secretary of the\r\nFreedmen's Aid and Southern Educational Society.\r\n\r\n[525] This building was dedicated as \"Science Hall\" but by vote of the\r\ntrustees the name was changed to \"Thirkield Hall\" in honor of\r\nPresident Thirkield when the latter resigned in 1912.\r\n\r\n[526] Much of the credit for the improvements to grounds and buildings\r\nis due to the experience and business acumen of Professor George W.\r\nCook who became secretary and business manager in 1908. Professor Cook\r\nhas enjoyed an extensive and unique connection with the University\r\nfrom his matriculation in the Preparatory Department in 1873 to the\r\npresent. He is a graduate of three departments and holds the degrees\r\nof A.B., A.M., LL.B. and LL.M. He has been dean of the Normal, the\r\nEnglish and the Commercial Departments successively. Since 1908 he has\r\nbeen secretary and business manager of the University.\r\n\r\n[527] Professor Miller is a product of Howard and one of her most\r\ndistinguished sons. He was graduated from Preparatory Department in\r\n1882 and from College in 1886 after which he pursued advanced studies\r\nat Johns Hopkins University. He is one of the most conspicuous\r\npublicists of the race, being the author of several books and numerous\r\npamphlets, beside making frequent contributions to periodicals, both\r\nin America and abroad. His most important books are _Race Adjustment_\r\nand _Out of the House of Bondage. The Disgrace of Democracy_, an open\r\nletter to President Wilson, published in 1917, has been pronounced one\r\nof the most important documents produced by the great war.\r\n\r\n[528] Dr. Newman was graduated from Bowdoin College, the alma mater of\r\nGeneral Howard, in 1867, with the A.B. degree, receiving the A.M. in\r\n1870 and D.D. in 1877. He studied theology at Andover, finishing in\r\n1871. He served as pastor in Taunton, Massachusetts, Ripon, Wisconsin\r\nand the First Congregational Church of Washington, District of\r\nColumbia. He was president of Eastern College, Fort Royal, Virginia,\r\n1908-9, and Kee Mar College for Women, Hagerstown, Maryland, 1909-11.\r\nHe is a member of a number of learned societies and a distinguished\r\npulpit orator.\r\n\r\n[529] President Taft considered the support of the University a\r\nnational obligation. In his address at the commencement exercises, May\r\n26, 1909, he said, in part:\r\n\r\n\"Everything that I can do as an executive in the way of helping along\r\nthe University I expect to do. I expect to do it because I believe it\r\nis a debt of the people of the United States, it is an obligation of\r\nthe Government of the United States, and it is money constitutionally\r\napplied to that which shall work out in the end the solution of one of\r\nthe greatest problems that God has put upon the people of the United\r\nStates.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOCUMENTS\r\n\r\nWHAT THE FRAMERS OF THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION THOUGHT OF THE NEGRO\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first important discussion in the Convention of 1787 to reflect\r\nthe attitude of the framers of the Federal Constitution toward the\r\nNegro, was whether or not slaves should be considered a part of the\r\npopulation in apportioning representation in Congress on that basis. A\r\nprecedent had been set in the Articles of Confederation in the\r\nprovision for counting five slaves as three whites to determine the\r\nrate of taxation on the population basis. The free States contended\r\nthat only the free inhabitants should be counted, but the slave States\r\nurged the recognition of slaves as a part of the population to secure\r\nto the South the power which it wielded until the Civil War.[530]\r\n\r\nTaking up this important question soon after the convention assembled,\r\n\r\n     The following resolution was then moved by Mr. Randolph, Resolved\r\n     that the rights of suffrage in the national legislature ought to\r\n     be proportioned to the quotas of contribution, or to the number\r\n     of free inhabitants, as the one or the other rule may seem best\r\n     in different cases.\r\n\r\n     It was moved by Mr. Hamilton seconded by Mr. Spaight that the\r\n     resolution be altered so as to read\r\n\r\n     Resolved that the rights of suffrage in the national legislature\r\n     ought to be proportioned to the number of free inhabitants\r\n\r\n     It was moved and seconded that the resolution be postponed--and\r\n     on the question to postpone it passed in the affirmative\r\n\r\n     The following resolution was moved by Mr. Randolph seconded by Mr\r\n     Madison Resolved that the rights of suffrage in the national\r\n     legislature ought to be proportioned--it was moved and seconded\r\n     to add the words \"and not according to the present system\"--On\r\n     the question to agree to the amendment it passed in the\r\n     affirmative. (Ayes--7 noes--0.)[531]\r\n\r\n     It was then moved and seconded so to alter the resolution that it\r\n     should read\r\n\r\n     Resolved that the rights of suffrage in the national legislature\r\n     ought not to be according\r\n\r\n     It was then moved and seconded to postpone the consideration of\r\n     the last resolution--And, on the question to postpone, it passed\r\n     in the affirmative The following resolution was then moved by Mr\r\n     Madison seconded by Mr. G Morris.\r\n\r\n     Resolved that the equality of suffrage established by the\r\n     articles of confederation ought not to prevail in the national\r\n     legislature and that an equitable ratio of representation ought\r\n     to be substituted.\r\n\r\n     It was moved and seconded to postpone the consideration of the\r\n     last resolution.\r\n\r\n     (The following Resolution being the 2d. of those proposed by Mr.\r\n     Randolph was taken up. viz--\"that the rights of suffrage in the\r\n     National Legislature ought to be proportioned to the quotas of\r\n     contribution, or to the number of free inhabitants, as the one or\r\n     the other rule may seem best in different cases.\")\r\n\r\n     Mr. M(adison) observing that the words (\"_or to the number of_)\r\n     _free inhabitants_.\" might occasion debates which would divert\r\n     the Committee from the general question whether the principle of\r\n     representation should be changed, moved that they might be struck\r\n     out.\r\n\r\n     Mr King observed that the quotas of contribution which would\r\n     alone remain as the measure of representation, would not answer;\r\n     because waving every other view of the matter, the revenue might\r\n     hereafter be so collected by the general Govt. that the sums\r\n     respectively drawn from the States would (not) appear; and would\r\n     besides be continually varying.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Madison admitted the propriety of the observation, and that\r\n     some better rule ought to be found.\r\n\r\n     Col. Hamilton moved to alter the resolution so as to read \"that\r\n     the rights of suffrage in the national Legislature ought to be\r\n     proportioned to the number of free inhabitants. Mr. Spaight\r\n     2ded. the motion.\r\n\r\n     It was then moved that the Resolution be postponed, which was\r\n     agreed to.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Randolph and Mr. Madison then moved the following\r\n     resolution--\"that the rights of suffrage in the national\r\n     Legislature ought to be proportioned.\"\r\n\r\n     It was moved and 2ded to amend it by adding \"and not according to\r\n     the present system\"--which was agreed to.\r\n\r\n     It was then moved and 2ded. to alter the resolution so as to read\r\n     \"that the rights of suffrage in the national Legislature ought\r\n     not to be according to the present system.\"\r\n\r\n     It was then moved & 2ded. to postpone the Resolution moved by Mr.\r\n     Randolph & Mr. Madison, which being agreed to;\r\n\r\n     Mr. Madison, moved, in order to get over the difficulties, the\r\n     following resolution--\"that the equality of suffrage established\r\n     by the articles of Confederation ought not to prevail in the\r\n     national Legislature, and that an equitable ratio of\r\n     representation ought to be submitted\" This was 2ded. by Mr. Govr.\r\n     Morris, (and being generally relished, would have been agreed to\r\n     when,)\r\n\r\n     Mr. Reed moved that the whole clause relating to the point of\r\n     Representation be postponed; reminding the Come. that the\r\n     deputies from Delaware were restrained by their commission from\r\n     assenting to any change of the rule of suffrage, and in case a\r\n     change should be fixed on, it might become their duty to retire\r\n     from the Convention.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Govr. Morris observed that the valuable assistance of those\r\n     members could not be lost without real concern, and that so early\r\n     a proof of discord in the convention as a secession of a State,\r\n     would add much to the regret; that the change proposed was\r\n     however so fundamental an article in a national Govt. that it\r\n     could not be dispensed with.\r\n\r\n     Mr. M(adison) observed that whatever reason might have existed\r\n     for the equality of suffrage when the Union was a federal one\r\n     among sovereign States, it must cease when a national Governt.\r\n     should be put into the place. In the former case, the acts of\r\n     Congs. depended so much for their efficacy on the cooperation of\r\n     the States, that these had a weight both within & without\r\n     Congress, nearly in proportion to their extent and importance. In\r\n     the latter case, as the acts of the Genl. Govt. would take effect\r\n     without the intervention of the State legislatures, a vote from\r\n     a small State wd. have the same efficacy & importance as (a vote)\r\n     from a large one, and there was the same reason for (different\r\n     numbers) of representatives from different States, as from\r\n     Counties of different extents within particular States. He\r\n     suggested as an expedient for at once taking the sense of the\r\n     members on this point and saving the Delaware deputies from\r\n     embarrassment, that the question should be taken in Committee,\r\n     and the clause on report to the House (be postponed without a\r\n     question there). This however did not appear to satisfy Mr. Read.\r\n\r\n     By several it was observed that no just construction of the Act\r\n     of Delaware, could require or justify a secession of her\r\n     deputies, even if the resolution were to be carried thro' the\r\n     House as well as the Committee. It was finally agreed however\r\n     that the clause should be postponed: it being understood that in\r\n     the event the proposed change of representation would certainly\r\n     be agreed to, no objection or difficulty being started from any\r\n     other quarter (than from Delaware).\r\n\r\n     The motion of Mr. Read to postpone being agreed to\r\n\r\n     The Committee then rose. The chairman reported progress, and the\r\n     House having resolved to resume the subject in Committee\r\n     tomorrow,[532]\r\n\r\n               (Adjourned to 10 OClock)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next question was on the following resolve:\r\n\r\n     In substance that the mode of the present representation was\r\n     unjust--the suffrage ought to be in proportion to number or\r\n     property.\r\n\r\n     To this Delaware objected, in consequence of the restrictions in\r\n     their credentials, and moved to have the consideration thereof\r\n     postponed, to which the house agreed.[533]\r\n\r\nMcHenry records for the thirtieth of May that the Committee then\r\nproceeded to consider the second resolution in Mr. Randolph's paper.\r\n\r\n     That the rights of suffrage in the national legislature ought to\r\n     be proportioned to the quotas of contribution or to the number\r\n     of free inhabitants as the one or the other rule may seem best\r\n     in different cases.\r\n\r\n     As this gave the large States the most absolute controul over the\r\n     lesser ones it met with opposition which produced an adjournment\r\n     without any determination.[534]\r\n\r\nAfter frequent discussion and the failure to reach an agreement to\r\nsafeguard the interests of the small States while giving due weight to\r\nthe population of the large the effort to apportion representation in\r\nthe national legislature assumed this form in the Committee of the\r\nWhole:\r\n\r\n     It was moved by Mr. King, seconded by Mr Rutledge to agree to the\r\n     following resolution, namely:\r\n\r\n     Resolved that the right of suffrage in the first branch of the\r\n     national Legislature ought not to be according to the rule\r\n     established in the articles of confederation; but according to\r\n     some equitable ratio of representation\r\n\r\n     And on the question to agree to the same\r\n\r\n     it passed in the affirmative (Ayes--7; noes--3; divided--1.)\r\n\r\n     It was then moved by Mr. Rutledge seconded by Mr Butler to add\r\n     the following words to the last resolution\r\n\r\n     \"namely, according to the quotas of contribution\"\r\n\r\n     It was moved by Mr Wilson seconded by Mr C. Pinckney to postpone\r\n     the consideration of the last motion in order to introduce the\r\n     following words, after the words \"equitable ratio of\r\n     representation\" namely.\r\n\r\n     \"in proportion to the whole number of white and other 'free\r\n     Citizens' and inhabitants of every age, sex and condition,\r\n     'including those bound to servitude for a term of years', and\r\n     three fifths of all other persons not comprehended in the\r\n     foregoing description, except Indians, not paying taxes 'in each\r\n     State.'\"\r\n\r\n     On the question to postpone\r\n\r\n     it passed in the affirmative. (Ayes--10; noes--1.)\r\n\r\n     On the question to agree to Mr Wilson's motion\r\n\r\n     It passed in the affirmative (Ayes--9; noes--2.)\r\n\r\n     It was then moved by Mr Wilson seconded by Mr Hamilton to adopt\r\n     the following resolution, namely,\r\n\r\n     \"resolved that the right of suffrage in the second branch \"of the\r\n     national Legislature ought to be according to the rule\r\n     \"established for the first\"\r\n\r\n     On the question to agree to the same it passed in the affirmative\r\n     (Ayes--6; noes--5.)[535]\r\n\r\nIn the Committee of the Whole on the eleventh of June:\r\n\r\n     It was then moved by Mr. Rutlidge 2ded. by Mr. Butler to add to\r\n     the words \"equitable ratio of representation\" at the end of the\r\n     motion just agreed to, the words \"according to the quotas of\r\n     Contribution. On motion of\r\n\r\n     _Mr. Wilson_ seconded by Mr. C. Pinckney, this was postponed; in\r\n     order to add, after, after the words \"equitable ratio of\r\n     representation\" the words following \"in proportion to the whole\r\n     number of white & other free Citizens & inhabitants of every age\r\n     sex & condition including those bound to servitude for a term of\r\n     years and three fifths of all other persons not comprehended in\r\n     the foregoing description, except Indians not paying taxes, in\r\n     each State.\" this being the rule in the Act of Congress agreed to\r\n     by eleven States, for apportioning quotas of revenue on the\r\n     States, and requiring a census only every 5--7, or 10 years.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Gerry thought property not the rule of representation. Why\r\n     then shd, the blacks, who were property in the South be in the\r\n     rule of representation more than the cattle & horses of the\r\n     North.\r\n\r\n     On the question.\r\n\r\n     Mass: Con: N. Y. Pen: Maryd. Virga. N. C. S. C. and Geo: were in\r\n     the affirmative: N. J. & Del: in the negative. (Ayes--9;\r\n     noes--2.) Mr. Sherman moved that a question be taken whether each\r\n     State shall have (one) vote in the 2d. branch. Every thing he\r\n     said depended on this. The smaller States would never agree to\r\n     the plan on any other principle (than an equality of suffrage in\r\n     this branch. Mr. Ellsworth seconded the motion.) On the question\r\n     for allowing each State (one) vote in the 2d. branch.\r\n\r\n     Massts, no. Cont, ay. N. Y. ay. N. J. ay. Pa. no. Del. ay Md. ay.\r\n     Va. no. N. C. no. S. C. no. Geo. no. (Ayes--5; noes--6.)\r\n\r\n     (Mr. Wilson & Mr. Hamilton moved that the right of suffrage in\r\n     the 2d. branch ought to be according to the same rule as in the\r\n     1st. branch.)\r\n\r\n     On this question for making the ratio of representation the same\r\n     in the 2d. as in the 1st. branch (it passed in the affirmative:)\r\n     Massts. ay.

(Ayes--6; noes--5.)[536]\r\n\r\nOn the same day\r\n\r\n     Mr. Wilson was of opinion, and therefore moved, _that the mode of\r\n     representation of each of the states ought to be from the number\r\n     of its free inhabitants, and of every other description three\r\n     fifths to one free inhabitant_. He supposed that the impost will\r\n     not be the only revenue--the post office he supposes would be\r\n     another substantial source of revenue. He observed further, that\r\n     this mode had already received the approbation of eleven states\r\n     in their acquiescence to the quota made by congress. He admitted\r\n     that this resolve would require further restrictions, for where\r\n     numbers determined the representation a census at different\r\n     periods of 5, 7 or 10 years, ought to be taken.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Gerry. The idea of property ought not to be the rule of\r\n     representation. Blacks are property, and are used to the\r\n     southward as horses and cattle to the northward; and why should\r\n     their representation be increased to the southward on account of\r\n     the number of slaves, than horses or oxen to the north?\r\n\r\n     Mr. Madison was of opinion at present, to fix the standard of\r\n     representation, and let the detail be the business of a\r\n     sub-committee.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Rutledge's motion was postponed.[537]\r\n\r\nDiscussing whether the apportionment should be according to taxation\r\nor numbers, Wilson considered\r\n\r\n     Either Rule good--by Numbers best to ascertain the Right of\r\n     Representn. this agreeably to the Sentiments of 11 States--Impost\r\n     alone will not be sufficient to answer the national\r\n     Exigencies--Revenues arising from Postage--The present Quota not\r\n     a lasting Rule--People to be numbered at fixed Periods--A Rule\r\n     arising from Property and Numbers--\r\n\r\n     Gerry. Rule of Taxation not the Rule of Representation--4 might\r\n     then have more Voices than ten--Slaves not to be put upon the\r\n     Footing of freemen--Freemen of Massts. not to be put upon a\r\n     Footing with the Slaves of other States--Horses and Cattle ought\r\n     to have the Right of Representn. Negroes--Whites--[538]\r\n\r\nOn the thirteenth of June Randolph submitted another resolution agreed\r\nto in the Committee of the Whole.\r\n\r\n  Resolved that the right of suffrage in the first branch of the\r\n     national Legislature ought not to be according to the rule\r\n     established in the articles of confederation; but according to\r\n     some equitable ratio of representation--namely in proportion to\r\n     the whole number of whites and other free citizens and\r\n     inhabitants, of every age, sex and condition, including those\r\n     bound to servitude for a term of years and three fifths of all\r\n     other persons not comprehended in the foregoing description,\r\n     except Indians, not paying taxes in each State.[539]\r\n\r\nThe following propositions from New Jersey moved by Patterson closely\r\nconnected the apportionment of requisitions with that of\r\nrepresentation:\r\n\r\n     3. Resd. that whenever requisitions shall be necessary, instead\r\n     of the rule for making requisitions mentioned in the articles of\r\n     Confederation, the United States in Congs. be authorized to make\r\n     such requisitions in proportion to the whole number of white &\r\n     other free citizens & inhabitants of every age sex and condition\r\n     including those bound to servitude for a term of years & three\r\n     fifths of all other persons not comprehended in the foregoing\r\n     description, except Indians not paying taxes; that if such\r\n     requisitions be not compiled with, in the time specified therein,\r\n     to direct the collection thereof in the non complying States &\r\n     for that purpose to devise and pass acts directing & authorizing\r\n     the same; provided that none of the powers hereby vested in the\r\n     U. States in Congs. shall be exercised without the consent of at\r\n     least[540]\r\n\r\nAgain on the fifteenth of June it was suggested that\r\n\r\n     3. The rule of apportioning Requis: on the States shall be the\r\n     Whites 3/5 of all others--if the Req. is in arrear in any State,\r\n     Congress shall have authority to devise & pass acts remedial in\r\n     such case.\r\n\r\nOn the fifth of July the committee considering the question of\r\nrepresentation reported on the 40,000 basis which repeatedly came\r\nbefore the Convention. It provided:\r\n\r\n     That in the first branch of the legislature, each of the states\r\n     now in the union, be allowed one member for every 40,000\r\n     inhabitants, of the description reported in the seventh\r\n     resolution of the committee of the whole house--That each state,\r\n     not containing that number, shall be allowed one member.[541]\r\n\r\nReporting on this question the fifth of July, the Committee of the\r\nWhole decided to submit:\r\n\r\n     That the subsequent propositions be recommended to the\r\n     Convention, on condition that both shall be generally adopted.\r\n\r\n     1st That in the first branch of the Legislature each of the\r\n     States now in the Union be allowed one Member for every forty\r\n     thousand inhabitants of the description reported in the seventh\r\n     resolution of the Committee of the whole House. That each State\r\n     not containing that number shall be allowed one Member--That all\r\n     Bills for raising or appropriating money and for fixing the\r\n     salaries of the Officers of the Government of the United States,\r\n     shall originate in the first Branch of the Legislature, and shall\r\n     not be altered or amended by the second Branch and that no money\r\n     shall be drawn from the public Treasury but in pursuance of\r\n     appropriations to be originated by the first Branch. 2ndly That\r\n     in the second Branch of the Legislature each State shall have an\r\n     equal Veto.\r\n\r\nDiscussing this question on the sixth of July:\r\n\r\n     Mr. Pinkney saw no good reason for committing. The value of land\r\n     had been found on full investigation to be an impracticable rule.\r\n     The contributions of revenue including imports & exports, must be\r\n     too changeable in their amount; too difficult to be adjusted; and\r\n     too injurious to the non-commercial States. The number of\r\n     inhabitants appeared to him the only just & practicable rule. He\r\n     thought the blacks ought to stand on an equality with whites: But\r\n     wd.--agree to the ratio settled by Congs. He contended that\r\n     Congs. had no right under the articles of Confederation to\r\n     authorize the admission of new States; no such cases having been\r\n     provided for.[542]\r\n\r\nOn the ninth of July, according to Madison, Mr. Gorham said:\r\n\r\n     Some provision of this sort was necessary in the outset. The\r\n     number of blacks & whites with some regard to supposed wealth\r\n     was the general guide. Fractions could not be observed. The\r\n     Legislre. is to make alterations from time to time as justice &\r\n     propriety may require. Two objections prevailed agst. the rate of\r\n     1 member for every 40,000 inhts. The 1st. was that the\r\n     Representation would soon be too numerous: the 2d. that the\r\n     Western States who may have a different interest, might if\r\n     admitted on that principal by degrees, out-vote the Atlantic.\r\n     Both these objections are removed. The number will be small in\r\n     the first instance and maybe continued so, and the Atlantic\r\n     States having ye Govt. in their own hands, may take care of their\r\n     own interest by dealing out the right of Representation in safe\r\n     proportions to the Western States. These were the views of the\r\n     Committee.[543]\r\n\r\nOn the tenth of July the following interesting comment was made.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Dayton observed that the line between the Northn. & Southern\r\n     interest had been improperly drawn: that Pa. was the dividing\r\n     State, there being six on each side of her.\r\n\r\n     Genl. Pinkney urged the reduction, dwelt on the superior wealth\r\n     of the Southern States, and insisted on its having its due weight\r\n     in the Government.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Govr. Morris regretted the turn of the debate. The States he\r\n     found had many Representatives on the floor. Few he fears were to\r\n     be deemed the Representatives of America. He thought the Southern\r\n     States have by the report more than their share of\r\n     representation. Property ought to have its weight; but not all\r\n     the weight. If the (Southn. States are to) supply money. The\r\n     Northn. States are to spill their blood. Besides, the probable\r\n     Revenue to be expected from the S. States has been greatly\r\n     overrated. He was agst. reducing N. Hampshire.[544]\r\n\r\nIn connection with determining the basis of representation the\r\nfollowing was offered on the eleventh of July:\r\n\r\n     \"Resolved That in order to ascertain the alterations that may\r\n     happen in the population and wealth of the several States a\r\n     census shall be taken of the free inhabitants of each State, and\r\n     three fifths of the inhabitants of other description on the first\r\n     year after this form of Government shall have been adopted--and\r\n     afterwards on every term of ____ years; and the Legislature shall\r\n     alter or augment the representation accordingly\"\r\n\r\n     It was moved and seconded to strike out the words\r\n\r\n     \"three fifths of\"\r\n\r\n     which passed in the negative. (Ayes--3; noes--7.)\r\n\r\n     It was moved and seconded to postpone the consideration of the\r\n     resolution proposed in order to take up the following namely.\r\n\r\n     Resolved That at the end of ____ years from the meeting of the\r\n     Legislature of the United-States and at the expiration of every\r\n     ____ years thereafter the Legislature of the United States be\r\n     required to apportion the representation of the several States\r\n     according to the principles of their wealth and population.\r\n\r\n     On the question to postpone, it passed in the negative (Ayes--5;\r\n     noes--5;)\r\n\r\n     It was moved and seconded to agree to the first clause of the\r\n     resolution namely.\r\n\r\n     \"That in order to ascertain the alterations that may happen in\r\n     the population and wealth of the several States a \"Census shall\r\n     be taken of each State\"\r\n\r\n     which passed in the affirmative (Ayes--6; noes--4.)\r\n\r\n     (To adjourn. Ayes--1; noes--9.)\r\n\r\n     It was moved and seconded to agree to the following clause of the\r\n     resolution, namely\r\n\r\n     \"and three fifths of the inhabitants of other description\"\r\n\r\n     which passed in the negative. (Ayes--4; noes--6.)\r\n\r\n     It was moved and seconded to agree to the following clause of the\r\n     resolution, namely\r\n\r\n     \"On the first year after this form of government shall \"have been\r\n     adopted\"\r\n\r\n     which passed in the affirmative (Ayes--7; noes--3.)\r\n\r\n     It was moved and seconded to fill up the blank with the word\r\n     \"fifteen\" which passed unanimously in the affirmative (Ayes--10;\r\n     noes--0.)\r\n\r\n     It was moved and seconded to add after the words fifteen years\r\n     the words \"at least\"\r\n\r\n     which passed in the negative (Ayes--5; noes--5.)\r\n\r\n     It was moved and seconded to agree to the following clause of the\r\n     resolution namely\r\n\r\n     \"and the Legislature shall alter or augment the representation\r\n     accordingly\"\r\n\r\n     which passed unanimously in the affirmative (Ayes--10; noes--0.)\r\n     On the question to agree to the resolution as amended it passed\r\n     unanimously in the negative. (Ayes--0; noes--10.) and then the\r\n     House adjourned till tomorrow at 11 o'clock A.M.[545]\r\n\r\nTaking up the question, Mr. Williamson urged again on the eleventh of\r\nJuly the counting of five Negroes as three white persons.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Williamson was for making it the duty of the Legislature to\r\n     do what was right & not leaving it at liberty to do or not do it.\r\n     He moved that Mr. Randolph's proposition be postponed, in order\r\n     to consider the following \"that in order to ascertain the\r\n     alterations that may happen in the population & wealth of the\r\n     several States, a census shall be taken of the free white\r\n     inhabitants and 3/5ths of those of other descriptions on the 1st\r\n     year (after this Government shall have been adopted) and every\r\n     year thereafter; and that the Representation be regulated\r\n     accordingly.[546]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Mr. Butler & Genl. Pinkney insisted that blacks be included in\r\n     the rule of Representation, _equally_ with the whites: (and for\r\n     that purpose moved that the words \"three fifths\" be struck\r\n     out.)[547]\r\n\r\n     Mr. Gerry though that 3/5 of them was to say the least the full\r\n     proportion that could be admitted.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Ghorum. This ratio was fixed by Congs. as a rule of taxation.\r\n     Then it was urged by the Delegates representing the States having\r\n     slaves that the blacks were still more inferior to freemen. At\r\n     present when the ratio of representation is to be established, we\r\n     are assured that they are equal to freemen. The arguments on ye.\r\n     former occasion had convinced him that 3/5 was pretty near the\r\n     just proportion and he should vote according to the same opinion\r\n     now.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Butler insisted that the labour of a slave in S. Carola. was\r\n     as productive & valuable as that of a freeman in Massts., that as\r\n     wealth was the great means of defence and utility to the Nation\r\n     they are equally valuable to it with freemen; and that\r\n     consequently an equal representation ought to be allowed for them\r\n     in a Government which was instituted principally for the\r\n     protection of property, and was itself to be supported by\r\n     property.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Mason could not agree to the motion, notwithstanding it was\r\n     favorable to Virga. because he thought it unjust. It was certain\r\n     that the slaves were valuable, as they raised the value of land,\r\n     increased the exports & imports, and of course the revenue, would\r\n     supply the means of feeding and supporting an army, and might in\r\n     cases of emergency become themselves soldiers. As in these\r\n     important respects they were useful to the community at large,\r\n     they ought not to be excluded from the estimate of\r\n     Representation. He could not, however, regard them as equal to\r\n     freemen and could not vote for them as such. He added as worthy\r\n     of remark, that the Southern States have this peculiar species of\r\n     property over & above the other species of property common to all\r\n     the States.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Williamson reminded Mr. Ghorum that if the Southn. States\r\n     contended for the inferiority of blacks to whites when taxation\r\n     was in view, the Eastern States on the same occasion contended\r\n     for their equality. He did (not) however either then or now,\r\n     concur in either extreme, but approved of the ratio of 3/5.\r\n\r\n     On Mr. Butlers motion for considering blacks as equal to Whites\r\n     in the apportionment for Representation\r\n\r\n     Massts. no. Cont. no. (N. Y. not on floor.) N. J. no. Pa. no.\r\n     Del. ay. Md. No. (Va. no) N. C. no. S. C. ay. Geo. ay. (Ayes--3;\r\n     noes--7.)\r\n\r\n     Mr. Govr. Morris said he had several objections to the\r\n     proposition of Mr. Williamson. 1. It fettered the Legislature too\r\n     much. 2. It would exclude some States altogether who would not\r\n     have a sufficient number to entitle them to a single\r\n     Representative. 3. It will not consist with the Resolution passed\r\n     on Saturday last authorizing the Legislature to adjust the\r\n     Representation from time to time on the principles of population\r\n     & wealth or with the principles of equity. If slaves were to be\r\n     considered as inhabitants, not as wealth, then the sd Resolution\r\n     would not be pursued: If as wealth, then why is no other wealth\r\n     but slaves included? These objections may perhaps be removed by\r\n     amendments. His great objection was that the number of\r\n     inhabitants was not a proper standard of wealth. The amazing\r\n     difference between the comparative numbers & wealth of different\r\n     Countries, renderd all reasoning superfluous on the subject.\r\n     Numbers might with greater propriety be deemed a measure of\r\n     strength, than of wealth, yet the late defence made by G. Britain\r\n     agst. her numerous enemies proved in the clearest manner, that it\r\n     is entirely fallacious even in this respect.\r\n\r\n     Mr. King thought there was great force in the objections of Mr.\r\n     Govr. Morris: he would however accede to the proposition for the\r\n     sake of doing something.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Rutlidge contended for the admission of wealth in the\r\n     estimate by which Representation should be regulated. The Western\r\n     States will not be able to contribute in proportion to their\r\n     numbers, they shd. not therefore be represented in that\r\n     proportion. The Atlantic States will not concur in such a plan.\r\n     He moved that \"at the end of ____ years after the 1st meeting of\r\n     the Legislature, and of every ____ years thereafter, the\r\n     Legislature shall proportion the Representation according to the\r\n     principles of wealth & population\"\r\n\r\n     Mr. Sherman thought the number of people alone the best rule for\r\n     measuring wealth as well as representation; and that if the\r\n     Legislature were to be governed by wealth, they would be obliged\r\n     to estimate it by numbers. He was at first for leaving the matter\r\n     wholly to the discretion of the Legislature; but he had been\r\n     convinced by the observations of (Mr. Randolph & Mr. Mason) that\r\n     the _periods_ & the _rule_ of revising the Representation ought\r\n     to be fixt by the Constitution\r\n\r\n     Mr. Reid thought the Legislature ought not to be too much\r\n     shackled. It would make the Constitution like Religious Creeds,\r\n     embarrassing to those bound to conform to them & more likely to\r\n     produce dissatisfaction and Scism, than harmony and union.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Mason objected to Mr. Rutlidge motion, as requiring of the\r\n     Legislature something too indefinite & impracticable, and leaving\r\n     them a pretext for doing nothing.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Wilson had himself no objection to leaving the Legislature\r\n     entirely at liberty. But considered wealth as an impracticable\r\n     rule.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Ghorum. If the Convention who are comparatively so little\r\n     biased by local views are so much perplexed, How can it be\r\n     expected that the Legislature hereafter under the full biass of\r\n     those views, will be able to settle a standard. He was convinced\r\n     by the argument of others & his own reflections, that the\r\n     Convention ought to fix some standard or other.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Govr. Morris. The argts. of others & his own reflections had\r\n     led him to a very different conclusion. If we can't agree on a\r\n     rule that will be just at this time, how can we expect to find\r\n     one that will be just in all times to come. Surely those who come\r\n     after us will judge better of things present, than we can of\r\n     things future. He could not persuade himself that numbers would\r\n     be a just rule at any time. * * * * * * * Another objection with\r\n     him agst admitting the blacks into the census, was that the\r\n     people of Pena. would revolt at the idea of being put on a\r\n     footing with slaves. They would reject any plan that was to have\r\n     such an effect. Two objections had been raised agst. leaving the\r\n     adjustment of the Representation from time to time, to the\r\n     discretion of the Legislature.[548]\r\n\r\nThe question of counting three-fifths of the Negroes as whites,\r\nhowever, would not down. According to Madison:\r\n\r\n     Mr. King, being much opposed to fixing numbers as the rule of\r\n     representation, was particularly so on account of the blacks. He\r\n     thought the admission of them along with Whites at all, would\r\n     excite great discontents among the States having no slaves. He\r\n     had never said as to any particular point that he would in no\r\n     event acquiesce in & support it; but he wd. say that if in any\r\n     case such a declaration was to be made by him, it would be in\r\n     this. He remarked that in the (temporary) allotment of\r\n     Representatives made by the Committee, the Southern States had\r\n     received more than the number of their white & three fifths of\r\n     their black inhabitants entitled them to.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Sherman. S. Carola. had not more beyond her proportion than\r\n     N. York & N. Hampshire, nor either of them more than was\r\n     necessary in order to avoid fractions or reducing them below\r\n     their proportion. Georgia had more; but the rapid growth of that\r\n     State seemed to justify it. In general the allotment might not be\r\n     just, but considering all circumstances, he was satisfied with\r\n     it.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Ghorum supported the propriety of establishing numbers as the\r\n     rule. He said that in Massts. estimates had been taken in the\r\n     different towns, and that persons had been curious enough to\r\n     compare these estimates with the respective numbers of people;\r\n     and it had been found even including Boston, that the most exact\r\n     proportion prevailed between numbers and property. He was aware\r\n     that there might be some weight in what had fallen from his\r\n     colleague, as to the umbrage which might be taken by the people\r\n     of the Eastern States. But he recollected that when the\r\n     proposition of Congs for changing the 8th art. of Confedn. was\r\n     before the Legislature of Massts. the only difficulty then was to\r\n     satisfy them that the negroes ought not to have been counted\r\n     equally with whites instead of being counted in the ratio of\r\n     three fifths only.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Wilson did not well see on what principle the admission of\r\n     blacks in the proportion of three fifths could be explained. Are\r\n     they admitted as Citizens? Then why are they not admitted on an\r\n     equality with White Citizens? Are they admitted as property, then\r\n     why is not other property admitted into the computation? These\r\n     were difficulties however which he thought must be overruled by\r\n     the necessity of compromise. He had some apprehensions also from\r\n     the tendency of the blending of the blacks with the whites, to\r\n     give disgust to the people of Pena. as had been intimated by his\r\n     colleagues (Mr. Govr. Morris). But he differed from him in\r\n     thinking numbers of inhabts. so incorrect a measure of wealth. He\r\n     had seen the Western settlemts. of Pa. and on a comparison of\r\n     them with the City of Philada. could discover little other\r\n     difference, than that property was more unequally divided among\r\n     individuals here than there. Taking the same number in the\r\n     aggregate in the two situations he believed there could be little\r\n     difference in their wealth and ability to contribute to the\r\n     public wants.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Govr. Morris was compelled to declare himself reduced to the\r\n     dilemma of doing injustice to the Southern States or to human\r\n     nature, and he must therefore do it to the former. For he could\r\n     never agree to give such encouragement to the slave trade as\r\n     would be given by allowing them a representation for their\r\n     negroes, and he did not believe those States would ever\r\n     confederate on terms that would deprive them of that trade.\r\n\r\n     On question for agreeing to include 3/5 of the blacks Masts, no\r\n     Cont. ay N. J. no. Pa. no Del. no. Mard. no Va. ay. N. C. ay. S.\r\n     C. no. Geo. ay (Ayes--6; noes--4.)[549]\r\n\r\nOn the twelfth of July the following clause was proposed:\r\n\r\n     \"Provided always that direct Taxation ought to be proportioned\r\n     according to representation\"\r\n\r\n     which passed unanimously in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n     It was moved and seconded to postpone the consideration of the\r\n     first clause in the report from the first grand Committee\r\n\r\n     which passed in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n     It was moved and seconded to add the following amendment to the\r\n     last clause adopted by the House namely \"and that the rule of\r\n     contribution by direct taxation for the support of the government\r\n     of the United States shall be the number of white inhabitants,\r\n     and three fifths of every other description in the several\r\n     States, until some other rule that shall more accurately\r\n     ascertain the wealth of the several States can be devised and\r\n     adopted by the Legislature[550]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     On the motion of Mr. Randolph, the vote of Saturday last (July 7)\r\n     authorizing the Legislre. to adjust from time to time, the\r\n     representation upon the principles of _Wealth_ and numbers of\r\n     inhabitants was (reconsidered by common consent in order to\r\n     strike our \"Wealth\" and adjust the resolution to that requiring\r\n     periodical revisions according to the number of whites & three\r\n     fifths of the blacks: the motion was in the words following--\"But\r\n     as the present situation of the States may probably alter in the\r\n     number of their inhabitants, that the Legislature of the U. S. be\r\n     authorized from time to time to apportion the number of\r\n     representatives: and in case any of the States shall hereafter be\r\n     divided or any two or more States united or new States created\r\n     within the limits of the U. S. shall hereafter be divided or any\r\n     two or more States united or new States created within the limits\r\n     of the U. S. the Legislature of U. S. shall possess authority to\r\n     regulate the number of Representatives in any of the foregoing\r\n     cases, upon the principle of their number of inhabitants;\r\n     according to the provisions hereafter mentioned.\")\r\n\r\n     Mr. Govr. Morris opposed the alteration as leaving still an\r\n     incoherence. If Negroes were to be viewed as inhabitants, and the\r\n     revision was to proceed on the principle of numbers of inhbts.\r\n     they ought to be added in their entire number, and not in the\r\n     proportion of 3/5. If as property, the word wealth was right, and\r\n     striking it out would produce the very inconsistency which it was\r\n     meant to get rid of.--The train of business & the late turn which\r\n     it had taken, had led him he said, into deep meditation on it,\r\n     and He wd. candidly state the result. A distinction had been set\r\n     up & urged between the Nn. & Southn. States. He had hitherto\r\n     considered this doctrine as heretical. He still thought the\r\n     distinction groundless. He sees however that it is persisted in;\r\n     and that the Southn. Gentleman will not be satisfied unless they\r\n     see the way open to their gaining a majority in the public\r\n     Councils. The consequence of such a transfer of power from the\r\n     maritime to the interior & landed interests will he forsees be\r\n     such an oppression of commerce, that he shall be obliged to vote\r\n     for ye. vicious principle of equality in the 2d. branch in order\r\n     to provide for some defence for the N. States agst. it. But to\r\n     come now more to the point, either this distinction is fictitious\r\n     or real: if fictitious let it be dismissed & let us proceed with\r\n     due confidence. If it be real, instead of attempting to blend\r\n     incompatible things, let us at once take a friendly leave of each\r\n     other. There can be no end of demands for security if every\r\n     particular interest is to be entitled to it. The Eastern States\r\n     may claim it for their fishery, and for other objects, as the\r\n     Southn. States claim it for their peculiar objects. In this\r\n     struggle between the two ends of the Union, what part ought the\r\n     Middle States in point of policy to take; to join their Eastern\r\n     brethren according to his ideas. If the Southn. States get the\r\n     power into their hands, and be joined as they will be the\r\n     interior Country they will inevitably bring on a war with Spain\r\n     for the Mississippi. This language is already held. The interior\r\n     Country having no property nor interest exposed on the sea, will\r\n     be little affected by such a war. He wished to know what security\r\n     the Northn. & middle States will have agst. this danger. It has\r\n     been said that N. C. S. C. and Georgia only will in a little time\r\n     have a majority of the people of America. They must in that case\r\n     include the great interior Country, and every thing was to be\r\n     apprehended from their getting the power into their hands.[551]\r\n\r\nThe Committee of Detail finally brought forward for the apportionment\r\nof direct taxes and representation in the House a plan for taking the\r\nNegroes into account.\r\n\r\n     (Direct Taxation shall always be in Proportion to Representation\r\n     in the House of Representatives.)\r\n\r\n     The proportions of direct Taxation shall be regulated by the\r\n     whole Number of white and other free Citizens and Inhabitants, of\r\n     every Age, Sex and Condition, including those bound to Servitude\r\n     for a Term of Years, and three fifths of all other Persons not\r\n     comprehended in the foregoing Description; which Number shall,\r\n     within the Term of every ten Years afterwards, be taken in such\r\n     manner as the said Legislature shall direct.[552]\r\n\r\nThis, as is shown below, is substantially what Rutledge as Chairman of\r\nthe committee to report a constitution reported.\r\n\r\n     Sect. 3. The proportions of direct taxation shall be regulated by\r\n     the whole number of white and other free citizens and\r\n     inhabitants, of every age, sex and condition, including those\r\n     bound to servitude for a term of years, and three fifths of all\r\n     other persons not comprehended in the foregoing description,\r\n     (except Indians not paying taxes) which number shall, within six\r\n     years after the first meeting of the Legislature, and within the\r\n     term of every ten years afterwards, be taken in such manner as\r\n     the said Legislature shall direct.[553]\r\n\r\nThe same appears also in the report of the Committee on Style.\r\n\r\n     Sect. 3. The proportions of direct taxation shall be regulated by\r\n     the whole number of free citizens and inhabitants, of every age,\r\n     sex and condition, including those bound to servitude for a term\r\n     of years, and three fifths of all other persons not comprehended\r\n     in the foregoing description, (except Indians not paying taxes)\r\n     which number shall, within three years after the first meeting of\r\n     the Legislature, and within the term of every ten years\r\n     afterwards, be taken in such manner as the said Legislature shall\r\n     direct.\r\n\r\n     (b) Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among\r\n     the several states which may be included within this Union,\r\n     according to their respective numbers, which shall be determined\r\n     by adding to the whole number of free persons, including those\r\n     bound to servitude for a term of years, and excluding Indians not\r\n     taxed, three fifths of all other persons. The actual enumeration\r\n     shall be made within three years after the first meeting of the\r\n     Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent term\r\n     of ten years, in such manner as they shall by law direct. The\r\n     number of representatives shall not exceed one for every forty\r\n     thousand, but each state shall have at least one representative:\r\n     and until such enumeration shall be made, the state of\r\n     New-Hampshire shall be entitled to chuse three, Massachusetts\r\n     eight, Rhode-Island and Providence Plantation one, Connecticut\r\n     five, New-York six, New-Jersey, four, Pennsylvania eight,\r\n     Delaware one, Maryland six, Virginia ten, North-Carolina five,\r\n     South-Carolina five and Georgia three.[554]\r\n\r\nWhat these framers said in explaining their intentions thereafter when\r\ndiscussing the constitution in ratifying conventions, legislatures and\r\nCongress, is further illuminating. Before the Maryland convention\r\ncalled to ratify the constitution Luther Martin said:\r\n\r\n     S: 2. Slaves ought never to be considered in Representation,\r\n     because they are property. They afford a rule as such in\r\n     Taxation; but are Citizens intrusted in the General Government,\r\n     no more than Cattle, Horses, Mules or Asses: and a Gentleman in\r\n     Debate very pertinently observed that he would as soon enter into\r\n     Compacts, with the Asses Mules, or Horses of the Ancient Dominion\r\n     as with their Slaves--When there is power to raise a revenue by\r\n     direct Taxation, each State ought to pay an equal Ratio; Whereas\r\n     by taxing Commerce some States pay greatly more than others,[555]\r\n\r\nBefore the South Carolina House of Representatives C. C. Pinckney\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     We are at a loss, for some time, for a rule to ascertain the\r\n     proportionate wealth of the states. At last we thought that the\r\n     productive labor of the inhabitants was the best rule for\r\n     ascertaining their wealth. In conformity to this rule, joined to\r\n     a spirit of concession, we determined that representatives should\r\n     be apportioned among the several states, by adding to the whole\r\n     number of free persons three fifths of the slaves. We thus\r\n     obtained a representation for our property; and I confess I did\r\n     not expect that we had conceded too much to the Eastern States,\r\n     when they allowed us a representation for a species of property\r\n     which they have not among them.[556]\r\n\r\nIn the New York Convention considering the ratification of the\r\nconstitution, Hamilton said:\r\n\r\n     The first thing objected to is that clause which allows a\r\n     representation for three fifths of the negroes.... The regulation\r\n     complained of was one result of the spirit of accommodation\r\n     which governed the Convention; and without this indulgence no\r\n     union could possibly have been formed.[557]\r\n\r\nOn July 24, 1788, in the North Carolina convention, Davie said:\r\n\r\n     ... The gentleman \"does not wish to be represented with negroes.\"\r\n     This, sir, is an unhappy species of population; but we cannot at\r\n     present alter their situation. The Eastern States had great\r\n     jealousies on this subject. They insisted that their cows and\r\n     horses were equally entitled to representation; that the one was\r\n     property as well as the other. It became our duty, on the other\r\n     hand, to acquire as much weight as possible in the legislation of\r\n     the Union; and, as the Northern States were more populous in\r\n     whites, this only could be done by insisting that a certain\r\n     proportion of our slaves should make a part of the computed\r\n     population. It was attempted to form a rule of representation\r\n     from a compound ratio of wealth and population; but, on\r\n     consideration, it was found impracticable to determine the\r\n     comparative value of lands and other property, in so extensive a\r\n     territory, with any degree of accuracy; and population alone was\r\n     adopted as the only practicable rule or criterion of\r\n     representation. It was urged by the deputies of the Eastern\r\n     States, that a representation would be unequal and\r\n     burdensome--that, in a time of war, slaves rendered a country\r\n     more vulnerable, while its defence devolved upon its free\r\n     inhabitants. On the other hand, we insisted that, in time of\r\n     peace, they contributed by their labor, to the general wealth, as\r\n     well as other members of the community--that, as rational beings,\r\n     they had a right of representation, and, in some instances, might\r\n     be highly useful in war. On these principles the Eastern States\r\n     gave the matter up, and consented to the regulation as it has\r\n     been read. I hope these reasons will appear satisfactory. It is\r\n     the same rule or principle which was proposed some years ago by\r\n     Congress, and assented to by twelve of the States....[558]\r\n\r\nIn the House of Representatives in 1820 C. C. Pinckney of South\r\nCarolina said:\r\n\r\n     Among the reasons which have induced me to rise, one is to\r\n     express my surprise. Surprise, did I say? I ought rather to have\r\n     said, my extreme astonishment, at the assertion I heard made on\r\n     both floors of Congress, that, in forming the Constitution of the\r\n     United States, and particularly that part of it which respects\r\n     the representation on this floor, the Northern and Eastern\r\n     States, or, as they are now called, the non-slaveholding States,\r\n     have made a great concession to the Southern in granting them a\r\n     representation of three-fifths of their slaves; that they saw the\r\n     concession was a very great and important one at the time, but\r\n     that they had no idea it would so soon have proved itself of such\r\n     consequence; that it would so soon have proved itself to be by\r\n     far the most important concession that had been made. They say,\r\n     that it was wrung from them by their affection to the Union, and\r\n     their wish to preserve it from dissolution or disunion; that they\r\n     had, for a long time, lamented they had made it; and that, if it\r\n     was to do over, no earthly consideration should again tempt them\r\n     to agree to so unequal and so ruinous a compromise....\r\n\r\n     It was, sir, for the purpose of correcting this great and\r\n     unpardonable error; unpardonable, because it is a wilful one, and\r\n     the error of it is well known to the ablest of those who make it;\r\n     of denying the assertion, and proving that the contrary is the\r\n     fact, and that the concession, on that occasion, was from the\r\n     Southern and the Northern States, that, among others, I have\r\n     risen.\r\n\r\n     It is of the greatest consequence that the proof I am about to\r\n     give should be laid before this nation; for, as the inequality of\r\n     representation is the great ground on which the Northern and\r\n     Eastern States have always, and now more particularly and\r\n     forcibly than ever, raised all their complaints on this subject,\r\n     if I can show and prove that they have not even a shadow of right\r\n     to make pretences or complaints; that they are as fully\r\n     represented as they ought to be; while, we, the Southern members,\r\n     are unjustly deprived of any representation for a large and\r\n     important part of our population, more valuable to the Union, as\r\n     can be shown, than any equal number of inhabitants in the\r\n     Northern and Eastern States, can, from their situation, climate,\r\n     and productions, possibly be. If I can prove this, I think I\r\n     shall be able to show most clearly the true motives which have\r\n     given rise to this measure; to strip the thin, the cobweb veil\r\n     from it, as well as the pretended ones of religion, humanity, and\r\n     love of liberty; and to show, to use the soft terms the decorum\r\n     of debate oblige me to use, the extreme want of modesty in those\r\n     who are already as fully represented here as they can be, to go\r\n     the great lengths they do in endeavoring, by every effort in\r\n     their power, public and private, to take from the Southern and\r\n     Western States, which are already so greatly and unjustly\r\n     deprived of an important part of the representation, a still\r\n     greater share; to endeavor to establish the first precedent,\r\n     which extreme rashness and temerity have ever presumed, that\r\n     Congress has a right to touch the question and legislate on\r\n     slavery; thereby shaking the property in them, in the Southern\r\n     and Western States, to its very foundation, and making an attack\r\n     which, if successful, must convince them that the Northern and\r\n     Eastern States are their greatest enemies; that they are\r\n     preparing measures for them which even Great Britain in the heat\r\n     of the Revolutionary War, and when all her passions were roused\r\n     by hatred and revenge to the highest pitch never ventured to\r\n     inflict upon them. Instead of a course like this, they ought, in\r\n     my judgment, sir, to be highly pleased with their present\r\n     situation; that they are fully represented, while we have lost so\r\n     great a share of our representation; they ought sir, to be highly\r\n     pleased at the dexterity and management of their members in the\r\n     Convention, who obtained for them this great advantage; and,\r\n     above all, with the moderation and forbearance with which the\r\n     Southern and Western States have always borne their many bitter\r\n     provocations on this subject, and now bear the open, avowed, and,\r\n     by many of the ablest men among them, undisguised attack on our\r\n     most valuable rights and properties....\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Before I proceed to the other parts of this question, I have thus\r\n     endeavored to give a new view of the subject of representation in\r\n     this House; to show how much more the Eastern and Northern States\r\n     are represented than the Southern and Western....\r\n\r\n     The supporters of the amendment contend that Congress have the\r\n     right to insist on the prevention of involuntary servitude in\r\n     Missouri; and found the right on the ninth section of the first\r\n     article, which says \"the migration or importation of such persons\r\n     as the States now existing may think proper to admit, shall not\r\n     be prohibited by the Congress prior to the year 1808, but a tax\r\n     or duty may be imposed on such importation not exceeding ten\r\n     dollars.\"\r\n\r\n     In considering this article, I will detail, as far as at this\r\n     distant period is possible, what was the intention of the\r\n     Convention that formed the Constitution in this article. The\r\n     intention was, to give Congress a power, after the year 1808, to\r\n     prevent the importation of slaves either by land or water from\r\n     other countries. The word _import_, includes both, and applies\r\n     wholly to slaves. Without this limitation Congress might have\r\n     stopped it sooner under their general power to regulate commerce;\r\n     and it was an agreed point, a solemnly understood compact, that,\r\n     on the Southern States consenting to shut their ports against the\r\n     importation of Africans, no power was to be delegated to\r\n     Congress, nor were they ever to be authorized to touch the\r\n     question of slavery; that the property of the Southern States in\r\n     slaves was to be as sacredly preserved, and protected to them, as\r\n     that of land, or any other kind of property in the Eastern States\r\n     were to be to their citizens.\r\n\r\n     The term, or word, migration, applies wholly to free whites; in\r\n     its Constitutional sense, as intended by the Convention, it means\r\n     \"voluntary change of servitude,\" from one country to another. The\r\n     reasons of its being adopted and used in the Constitution, as far\r\n     as I can recollect, were these; that the Constitution being a\r\n     frame of government, consisting wholly of delegated powers, all\r\n     power, not expressly delegated, being reserved to the people or\r\n     the States, it was supposed, that, without some express grant to\r\n     them of power on the subject, Congress would not be authorized\r\n     ever to touch the question of migration hither, or emigration to\r\n     this country, however pressing or urgent the necessity for such a\r\n     measure might be; that they could derive no such power from the\r\n     usages of nations, or even the laws of war; that the latter would\r\n     only enable them to make prisoners of alien enemies, which would\r\n     not be sufficient, as spies or other dangerous emigrants, who\r\n     were not alien enemies, might enter the country for treasonable\r\n     purposes, and do great injury; that, as all governments possessed\r\n     this power, it was necessary to give it to our own, which could\r\n     alone exercise it, and where, on other and much greater points,\r\n     we had placed unlimited confidence; it was, therefore, agreed\r\n     that, in the same article, the word migration should be placed;\r\n     and that, from the year 1808, Congress should possess the\r\n     complete power to stop either or both, as they might suppose the\r\n     public interest required; the article, therefore, is a _negative\r\n     pregnant_, restraining for twenty years, and giving the power\r\n     after.\r\n\r\n     The reasons for restraining the power to prevent migration hither\r\n     for twenty years, were, to the best of my recollections, these;\r\n     That, as at this time, we had immense and almost immeasurable\r\n     territory, peopled by not more than two millions and a half of\r\n     inhabitants, it was of very great consequence to encourage the\r\n     emigration of able, skilful, and industrious Europeans. The wise\r\n     conduct of William Penn, and the unexampled growth of\r\n     Pennsylvania, were cited. It was said, that the portals of the\r\n     only temple of true freedom now existing on earth should be\r\n     thrown open to all mankind; that all foreigners of industrious\r\n     habits should be welcome, and none more so than men of science,\r\n     and such as may bring to us arts we are unacquainted with, or the\r\n     means of perfecting those in which we are not yet sufficiently\r\n     skilled--capitalists whose wealth may add to our commerce or\r\n     domestic improvements; let the door be ever and most\r\n     affectionately open to illustrious exiles and sufferers in the\r\n     cause of liberty; in short, open it liberally to science, to\r\n     merit, and talents, wherever found, and receive and make them\r\n     your own. That the safest mode would be to pursue the course for\r\n     twenty years, and not, before that period, put it at all into the\r\n     power of Congress to shut it; that, by that time, the Union would\r\n     be so settled, and our population would be so much increased, we\r\n     could proceed on our own stock, without the farther accession of\r\n     foreigners; that as Congress were to be prohibited from stopping\r\n     the importation of slaves to settle the Southern States, as no\r\n     obstacles was to be thrown in the way of their increase and\r\n     settlement for that period, let it be so with the Northern and\r\n     Eastern, to which, particularly New York and Philadelphia it was\r\n     expected most of the emigrants would go from Europe: and it so\r\n     happened, for, previous to the year 1808, more than double as\r\n     many Europeans emigrated to these States, as of Africans were\r\n     imported into the Southern States.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nConnecting the question of importing slaves with that of counting them\r\nto determine the representation in the national legislature, the\r\nframers engaged in a heated debate as to whether or not the Southern\r\nStates would always have a majority in that body by encouraging the\r\nslave trade. Carolina and Georgia, however, stood firm for the right\r\nto import slaves.\r\n\r\n     On July 23 General Pinckney reminded the Convention that if the\r\n     Committee should fail to insert some security to the Southern\r\n     States agst. an emancipation of slaves, and taxes on exports, he\r\n     shd. be bound by duty to his State to vote agst. their\r\n     Report--The appt. of a Come. as moved by Mr. Gerry, Agd. to nem.\r\n     con.[559]\r\n\r\nThe Committee of Detail, therefore, reported:\r\n\r\n     2 no prohibitions or (such) (ye) Importations of such inhabitants\r\n     (or people as the sevl. States think proper to admit)\r\n\r\n     No Tax or Duty shall be laid by the Legislature, on Articles\r\n     exported from any State; nor on the emigration or importation of\r\n     such Persons as the several States shall think proper to admit;\r\n     nor shall such emigration or importation be prohibited.\r\n\r\n     No Capitation Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion to the\r\n     Census herein before directed to be taken.\r\n\r\nThe draft of the constitution reported on August 6 carried:[32]\r\n\r\n     Sect. 4. No tax or duty shall be laid by the Legislature on\r\n     articles exported from any State; nor on the migration or\r\n     importation of such persons as the several States shall think\r\n     proper to admit; nor shall such migration or importation be\r\n     prohibited.\r\n\r\nOn the eighth of August, King remarked:[560]\r\n\r\n     Mr. King wished to know what influence the vote just passed was\r\n     meant have on the succeeding part of the Report, concerning the\r\n     admission of slaves into the rule of Representation. He could not\r\n     reconcile his mind to the article if it was to prevent objections\r\n     to the latter part. The admission of slaves was a most grating\r\n     circumstance to his mind, & he believed would be so to a great\r\n     part of the people of America. He had not made a strenuous\r\n     opposition to it heretofore because he had hoped that this\r\n     concession would have produced a readiness which had not been\r\n     manifested, to strengthen the Genl. Govt. and to mark a full\r\n     confidence in it. The Report under consideration had by the tenor\r\n     of it, put an end to all these hopes. In two great points the\r\n     hands of the Legislature were absolutely tied. The importation of\r\n     slaves could not be prohibited--exports could not be taxed. Is\r\n     this reasonable? What are the great objects of the Genl. System?\r\n     1. defence agst. foreign invasion. 2 agst. internal sedition.\r\n     Shall all the States then be bound to defend each; & shall each\r\n     be at liberty to introduce a weakness which will render defence\r\n     more difficult? Shall one part of the U. S. be bound to defend\r\n     another part, and that other part be at liberty not only to\r\n     increase its own danger, but to withhold the compensation for the\r\n     burden? If slaves are to be imported shall not the exports\r\n     produced by their labor, supply a revenue the better to enable\r\n     the Genl. Govt. to defend their masters?--There was so much\r\n     inequality & unreasonableness in all this, that the people of the\r\n     N(orthern) States could never be reconciled (to it). No candid\r\n     man could undertake to justify it to them. He had hoped that some\r\n     accommodation wd. have taken place on this subject; that at least\r\n     a time wd. have been limited for the importation of slaves. He\r\n     never could agree to let them be imported without limitation &\r\n     then be represented in the Natl. Legislature. Indeed he could so\r\n     little persuade himself of the rectitude of such a practice, that\r\n     he was not sure he could assent to it under any circumstances. At\r\n     all events, either slaves should not be represented, or exports\r\n     should be taxable.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Sherman regarded the slave-trade as iniquitous; but the point\r\n     of representation having been settled after much difficuty &\r\n     deliberation, he did not think himself bound to make opposition;\r\n     especially as the present articles as amended did not preclude\r\n     any arrangement whatever on that point in another place of the\r\n     Report.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Govr. Morris moved to insert \"free\" before the word\r\n     \"inhabitants.\" Much he said would depend on this point. He never\r\n     would concur in upholding domestic slavery. It was a nefarious\r\n     institution--It was the curse of heaven on the States where it\r\n     prevailed. Compare the free regions of the Middle States, where a\r\n     rich & noble cultivation marks the prosperity & happiness of the\r\n     people, with the misery & poverty which overspread the barren\r\n     wastes of Va. Maryd & the other States having slaves. (Travel\r\n     thro' ye whold Continent & you behold the prospect continually\r\n     varying with the appearance and disappearance of slavery. The\r\n     moment you leave ye E Sts. & enter N. York, the effects of the\r\n     institution become visible; Passing thro' the Jerseys and\r\n     entering Pa--every criterion of superior improvement witnesses\r\n     the change. Proceed Southwdly, & every step you take thro' ye\r\n     great regions of slaves, presents a desert increasing with ye\r\n     increasing proportion of these wretched beings.)\r\n\r\n     Upon what principle is it that the slaves shall be computed in\r\n     the representation? Are they men? Then make them Citizens & let\r\n     them vote? Are they property? Why then is no other property\r\n     included? The Houses in this City (Philada.) are worth more than\r\n     all the wretched slaves which cover the rice swamps of South\r\n     Carolina. The admission of slaves into the Representation when\r\n     fairly explained comes to this: that inhabitant of Georgia and S.\r\n     C. who goes to the Coast of Africa and in defiance of the most\r\n     sacred laws of humanity tears away his fellow creatures from\r\n     their dearest connections & dam(n)s them to the most cruel\r\n     bondages, shall have more votes in a Govt. instituted for\r\n     protection of the rights of mankind, than the Citizens of Pa or\r\n     N. Jersey who views with a laudable horror, so nefarious a\r\n     practice. He would add that Domestic slavery is the most\r\n     prominent feature in the aristocratic countenance of the proposed\r\n     Constitution. The vassalage of the poor has ever been the\r\n     favorite offspring of Aristocracy. And What is the proposed\r\n     compensation to the Northern States for a sacrifice of every\r\n     principle of right, of every impulse of humanity. They are to\r\n     bind themselves to march their militia for the defence of the S.\r\n     States; for their defence agst those very slaves of whom they\r\n     complain. They must supply vessels & seamen, in case of foreign\r\n     Attack. The Legislature will have indefinite power to tax them by\r\n     excises, and duties on imports; both of which will fall heavier\r\n     on them than on the Southern inhabitants; for the bohea tea used\r\n     by a Northern freeman, will pay more tax than the whole\r\n     consumption of the miserable slave, which consists of nothing\r\n     more than his physical subsistence and the rag that covers his\r\n     nakedness. On the other side the Southern States are not to be\r\n     restrained from importing fresh supplies of wretched Africans, at\r\n     once to increase the danger of attack, and the difficulty of\r\n     defence; nay they are to be encouraged to it by an assurance of\r\n     having their votes in the Natl Govt increased in proportion, and\r\n     are at the same time to have their exports & their slaves exempt\r\n     from all contributions for the public service. Let it not be said\r\n     that direct taxation is to be proportioned to representation. It\r\n     is idle to suppose that the Genl Govt. can stretch its hand\r\n     directly into the pockets of the people scattered over so vast a\r\n     Country. They can only do it through the medium of exports\r\n     imports & excises. For what then are all these sacrifices to be\r\n     made? He would sooner submit himself to a tax for paying for all\r\n     the Negroes in the U. States, than saddle posterity with such a\r\n     Constitution.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Dayton 2ded. the motion. He did it he said that his\r\n     sentiments on the subject might appear whatever might be the fate\r\n     of the amendment.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Sherman, did not regard the admission of the Negroes into the\r\n     ratio of representation, as liable to such insuperable\r\n     objections. It was the freemen of the Southn. States who were in\r\n     fact to be represented according to the taxes paid by them, and\r\n     the Negroes are only included in the Estimate of the taxes. This\r\n     was his idea of the matter.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Pinkney, considered the fisheries & the Western frontier as\r\n     more burdensome to the U. S. than the slaves--He thought this\r\n     could be demonstrated if the occasion were a proper one.\r\n\r\n     Mr Wilson, thought the motion premature--An agreement to the\r\n     clause would be no bar to the object of it.\r\n\r\n     Question On Motion to insert \"free\" before \"inhabitants.\"\r\n\r\n     N.

As five slaves are to be counted as 3 free men in the\r\n     apportionment of Representatives; such a clause wd. leave an\r\n     encouragement to this traffic.\r\n\r\n     2. slaves weakened one part of the Union which the other parts\r\n     were bound to protect: the privilege of importing them was\r\n     therefore unreasonable--\r\n\r\n     3. it was inconsistent with the principles of the revolution and\r\n     dishonorable to the American character to have such a feature in\r\n     the Constitution.\r\n\r\n     Mr Rutlidge did not see how the importation of slaves could be\r\n     encouraged by this section. He was not apprehensive of\r\n     insurrections and would readily exempt the other States from the\r\n     (obligation to protect the Southern against them.).--Religions &\r\n     humanity had nothing to do with this question--Interest alone is\r\n     the governing principle with Nations--The true question at\r\n     present is whether the Southn. States shall or shall not be\r\n     parties to the Union. If the Northern States consult their\r\n     interest, they will not oppose the increase of Slaves which will\r\n     increase the commodities of which they will become the carriers.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Ellsworth was for leaving the clause as it stands, let every\r\n     State import what it pleases. The morality or wisdom of slavery\r\n     are considerations belonging to the States themselves--What\r\n     enriches a part enriches the whole, and the States are the best\r\n     judges of their particular interest. The old confederation had\r\n     not meddled with this point, and he did not see any greater\r\n     necessity for bringing it within the policy of the new one:\r\n\r\n     Mr Pinkney. South Carolina can never receive the plan if it\r\n     prohibits the slave trade. In every proposed extension of the\r\n     powers of Congress, that State has expressly & watchfully\r\n     excepted that of meddling with the importation of negroes. If the\r\n     States be all left at liberty on this subject, S. Carolina may\r\n     perhaps by degrees do of herself what is wished, as Virginia &\r\n     Maryland have already done.[562]\r\n\r\n  Adjourned\r\n\r\n     Art. VII sect 4. resumed. Mr. Sherman was for leaving the clause\r\n     as it stands. He disapproved of the slave trade: yet as the\r\n     States were now possessed of the right to import slaves, as the\r\n     public good did not require it to be taken from them, & as it was\r\n     expedient to have as few objections as possible to the proposed\r\n     scheme of Government, he thought it best to leave the matter as\r\n     we find it.[34] He observed that the abolition of slavery seemed\r\n     to be going on in the U. S. & that the good sense of the several\r\n     States would probably by degrees complete it. He urged on the\r\n     Convention the necessity of despatch(ing its business.)\r\n\r\n     Col. Mason. This infernal trafic originated in the avarice of\r\n     British Merchants. The British Govt. constantly checked the\r\n     attempts of Virginia to put a stop to it. The present question\r\n     concerns not the importing States alone but the whole Union. The\r\n     evil of having slaves was experienced during the late war. Had\r\n     slaves been treated as they might have been by the Enemy, they\r\n     would have proved dangerous instruments in their hands. But their\r\n     folly dealt by the slaves, as it did by the Tories. He mentioned\r\n     the dangerous insurrections of the slaves in Greece and Sicily;\r\n     and the instructions given by Cromwell to the Commissioners sent\r\n     to Virginia to arm the servants & slaves, in case other means of\r\n     obtaining its submission should fail. Maryland & Virginia he said\r\n     had already prohibited the importation of slaves expressly. N.\r\n     Carolina had done the same in substance. All this would be in\r\n     vain if S. Carolina & Georgia be at liberty to import. The\r\n     Western people are already calling out for slaves for their new\r\n     lands; and will fill that Country with slaves if they can be got\r\n     thro' S. Carolina & Georgia. Slavery discourages arts &\r\n     manufactures. The poor despise labor when performed by slaves.\r\n     They prevent the immigration of Whites, who really enrich &\r\n     strengthen a Country. They produce the most pernicious effect on\r\n     manners. Every master of slaves is born a petty tyrant. They\r\n     bring the judgment of heaven on a Country. As nations can not be\r\n     rewarded or punished in the next world they must be in this. By\r\n     an inevitable chain of causes & effects providence punishes\r\n     national calamities. He lamented that some of our Eastern\r\n     brethren had from a lust of gain embarked in this nefarious\r\n     traffic. As to the States being in possession of the Right to\r\n     import, this was the case with many other rights, now to be\r\n     properly given up. He held it essential in every point of view,\r\n     that the Genl. Govt. should have power to prevent the increase of\r\n     slavery.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Ellsworth. As he had never owned a slave could not judge of\r\n     the effects of slavery on character. He said however that if it\r\n     was to be considered in a moral light we ought to go farther and\r\n     free those already in the Country.--As slaves also multiply so\r\n     fast in Virginia & Maryland that it is cheaper to raise than\r\n     import them, whilst in the sickly rice swamps foreign supplies\r\n     are necessary, if we go no farther than is urged, we shall be\r\n     unjust towards S. Carolina & Georgia--Let us not intermeddle. As\r\n     population increases; poor laborers will be so plenty as to\r\n     render slaves useless. Slavery in time will not be a speck in our\r\n     Country. Provision is already taken place in Connecticut for\r\n     abolishing it. And the abolition has already taken place in\r\n     Massachusetts. As to the danger of insurrection from foreign\r\n     influence, that will become a motive to kind treatment of the\r\n     slaves.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Pinkney--If slavery be wrong, it is justified by the example\r\n     of the world. He cited the case of Greece, Rome & other ancient\r\n     States; the sanction given by France, England, Holland & other\r\n     modern States. In all ages one half of mankind have been slaves.\r\n     If the S. States were let alone they will probably of themselves\r\n     stop importations. He wd. himself as a Citizen of S. Carolina\r\n     vote for it. An attempt to take away the right as proposed will\r\n     produce serious objections to the Constitution which he wished to\r\n     see adopted.\r\n\r\n     General Pinkney declared it to be his firm opinion that if\r\n     himself & all his colleagues were to sign the Constitution & use\r\n     their personal influence, it would be of no avail towards\r\n     obtaining the assent of their Constituents. S. Carolina & Georgia\r\n     cannot do without slaves. As to Virginia she will gain by\r\n     stopping the importations. Her slaves will rise in value, & she\r\n     has more than she wants. It would be unequal to require S. C. &\r\n     Georgia to confederate on such unequal terms. He said the Royal\r\n     assent before the Revolution had never been refused to S.\r\n     Carolina as to Virginia. He contended that the importation of\r\n     slaves would be for the interest of the whole Union. The more\r\n     slaves, the more produce to employ the carrying trade; the more\r\n     consumption also, and the more of this, the more of revenue for\r\n     the common treasury. He admitted it to be reasonable that slaves\r\n     should be dutied like other imports, but should consider a\r\n     rejection of the clause as an exclusion of S. Carola from the\r\n     Union.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Baldwin had conceived national object alone to be before the\r\n     Convention, not such as like the present were of a local nature.\r\n     Georgia was decided on this point. That State has always hitherto\r\n     supposed a Genl Government to be the pursuit of the central\r\n     States who wished to have a vortex for every thing--that her\r\n     distance would preclude her from equal advantage--& that she\r\n     could not prudently purchase it by yielding national powers. From\r\n     this it might be understood in what light she would view an\r\n     attempt to abridge one of her favorite prerogatives. If left to\r\n     herself, she may probably put a stop to the evil. As one ground\r\n     for this conjecture, he took notice of the sect of which he said\r\n     was a respectable class of people, who carryed their ethics\r\n     beyond the mere _equality of men_, extending their humanity to\r\n     the claims of the whole animal creation.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Wilson observed that if S. C. & Georgia were themselves\r\n     disposed to get rid of the importation of slaves in a short time\r\n     as had been suggested, they would never refuse to unite because\r\n     the importation might be prohibited. As the Section now stands\r\n     all articles imported are to be taxed. Slaves alone are exempt.\r\n     This is in fact a bounty on that article.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Gerry thought we had nothing to do with the conduct of the\r\n     States as to Slaves, but ought to be careful not to give any\r\n     sanction to it.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Dickinson considered it as inadmissible on every principle of\r\n     honor & safety that the importation of slaves should be\r\n     authorized to the States by the Constitution. The true question\r\n     was whether the national happiness would be promoted or impeded\r\n     by the importation, and this question ought to be left to the\r\n     National Govt. not to the States particularly interested. If\r\n     Engd. & France permit slavery, slaves are at the same time\r\n     excluded from both those kingdoms. Greece and Rome were made\r\n     unhappy by their slaves. He could not believe that the Southn.\r\n     States would refuse to confederate on the account apprehended;\r\n     especially as the power was not likely to be immediately\r\n     exercised by the Genl. Government.\r\n\r\n     Mr Williamson stated the law of N. Carolina on the subject, to\r\n     wit that it did not directly prohibit the importation of slaves.\r\n     It imposed a duty of L5. on each slave imported from Africa. L10.\r\n     on each from elsewhere, & L50 on each from a State licensing\r\n     manumission. He thought the S. States could not be members of the\r\n     Union if the clause should be rejected, and that it was wrong to\r\n     force any thing down, not absolutely necessary, and which any\r\n     State must disagree to.\r\n\r\n     Mr. King thought the subject should be considered in a political\r\n     light only. If two States will not agree to the Constitution as\r\n     stated on one side, he could affirm with equal belief on the\r\n     other, that great & equal opposition would be experienced from\r\n     the other States. He remarked on the exemption of slaves from\r\n     duty whilst every other import was subjected to it, as an\r\n     inequality that could not fail to strike the commercial sagacity\r\n     of the Northn. & middle States.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Langdon was strenuous for giving the power to the Genl Govt.\r\n     He cd. not with a good conscience leave it with the States who\r\n     could then go on with the traffic, without being restrained by\r\n     the opinions here given that they will themselves cease to import\r\n     slaves.\r\n\r\n     Genl. Pinkney thought himself bound to declare candidly that he\r\n     did not think S. Carolina would stop her importations of slaves\r\n     in any short time, but only stop them occasionally as she now\r\n     does. He moved to commit the clause that slaves might be made\r\n     liable to an equal tax with other imports which he thought right\r\n     & wh. wd. remove one difficulty that had been started.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Rutlidge. If the Convention thinks that N. C.; S. C. &\r\n     Georgia will ever agree to the plan, unless their right to import\r\n     slaves be untouched, the expectation is vain. The people of those\r\n     States will never be such fools as to give up so important an\r\n     interest. He was strenuous agst. striking out the Section, and\r\n     seconded the motion of Genl. Pinkney for a commitment.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Govr. Morris wished the whole subject to be committed\r\n     including the clauses relating to taxes on exports & to a\r\n     navigation act. These things may form a bargain among the\r\n     Northern & Southern States.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Butler declared that he never would agree to the power of\r\n     taxing exports.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Sherman said it was better to let the S. States import slaves\r\n     than to part with them, if they made that a sine qua non. He was\r\n     opposed to a tax on slaves imported as making the matter worse,\r\n     because it implied they were _property_. He acknowledged that if\r\n     the power of prohibiting the importation should be given to the\r\n     Genl. Government that it would be exercised. He thought it would\r\n     be its duty to exercise the power.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Read was for the commitment provided the clause concerning\r\n     taxes on exports should also be committed.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Sherman, observed that that clause had been agreed to &\r\n     therefore could not committed.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Randolph was for committing in order that some middle ground\r\n     might, if possible, be found. He could never agree to the clause\r\n     as it stands. He wd. sooner risk the constitution--He dwelt on\r\n     the dilemma to which the Convention was exposed. By agreeing to\r\n     the clause, it would revolt the Quakers, the Methodists, and many\r\n     others in the State having no slaves. On the other hand, two\r\n     States might be lost to the Union. Let us then, he said, try the\r\n     chance of a commitment.\r\n\r\n     On the question for committing the remaining part of Sect. 4 & 5.\r\n     of art: 7. N. H. no. Mas. abst. Cont. ay N.

Is it meant to\r\n     require a greater proportion of votes? He desired it to be\r\n     remembered that the Eastern States had no motive to Union but a\r\n     commercial one. They were able to protect themselves. They were\r\n     not afraid of external danger, and did not need the aid of the\r\n     Southn. States.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Wilson wished for a commitment in order to reduce the\r\n     proportion of votes required.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Ellsworth was for taking the plan as it is. This widening of\r\n     opinions has a threatening aspect. If we do not agree on this\r\n     middle & moderate ground he was afraid we should lose two States,\r\n     with such others as may be disposed to stand aloof, should fly\r\n     into a variety of shapes & directions, and most probably into\r\n     several confederations and not without bloodshed.\r\n\r\n     On Question for committing 6 sect. as to navigation Act to a\r\n     member from each State--N.

Carolina Georgia etc--would be a\r\n     monopoly in their favor. These States could not do without\r\n     Slaves--Virginia etc would make their own terms for such as they\r\n     might sell.\r\n\r\n     Such was the situation of the country that it could not exist\r\n     without slaves--That they could confederate on no other\r\n     condition.\r\n\r\n     They had enjoyed the right of importing slaves when colonies.\r\n\r\n     They enjoyed it as States under the confederation--And if they\r\n     could not enjoy it under the proposed government, they could not\r\n     associate or make a part of it.\r\n\r\n     Several additions were reported by the Committee.[564]\r\n\r\nUpon taking up the report of the Committee of Eleven on the\r\ntwenty-fifth of August\r\n\r\n     Genl Pinkney moved to strike out the words \"the year eighteen\r\n     hundred\" (as the year limiting the importation of slaves,) and to\r\n     insert the words \"the year eighteen hundred and eight\"\r\n\r\n     Mr. Ghorum 2ded the motion\r\n\r\n     Mr. Madison. Twenty years will produce all the mischief that can\r\n     be apprehended from the liberty to import slaves.

This he said would be most fair and\r\n     would avoid the abiguity by which, under the power with regard to\r\n     naturalization, the liberty reserved to the States might be\r\n     defeated. He wished it to be known also that this part of the\r\n     Constitution was a compliance with those States. If the change of\r\n     language however should be objected to by the members from those\r\n     States, he should not urge it.\r\n\r\n     Col. Mason was not against using the term \"slaves\" but agst\r\n     naming N--C--S--C. & Georgia, lest it should give offence to the\r\n     people of those States.\r\n\r\n     Mr Sherman liked a description better than the terms proposed,\r\n     which had been declined by the old Congs & were not pleasing to\r\n     some people. Mr. Clymer concurred with Mr. Sherman.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Williamson said that both in opinion & practice he was,\r\n     against slavery; but thought it more in favor of humanity, from a\r\n     view of all circumstances, to let in S--C & Georgia on those\r\n     terms, than to exclude them from the Union--\r\n\r\n     Mr. Govr. Morris withdrew his motion.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Dickenson wished the clause to be confined to the States\r\n     which had not themselves prohibited the importation of slaves,\r\n     and for that purpose moved to amend the clause so as to read \"The\r\n     importation of slaves into such of the States as shall permit the\r\n     same shall not be prohibited by the Legislature of the\r\n     U--S--until the year 1808\".--which was agreed to nem: cont:\r\n\r\n     The first part of the report was then agreed to, amended as\r\n     follows. \"The migration or importation of such persons as the\r\n     several States now existing shall think proper to admit shall not\r\n     be prohibited by the Legislature prior to the year 1808.\" N.

Pinkney admitted that it was so.\r\n\r\n     Col. Mason. Not to tax, will be equivalent to a bounty on the\r\n     importation of slaves.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Ghorum thought that Mr. Sherman should consider the duty, not\r\n     as implying that slaves are property, but as a discouragement to\r\n     the importation of them.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Govr, Morris remarked that as the clause now stands it\r\n     implies that the Legislature may tax freemen imported.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Sherman in answer to Mr. Ghorum observed that the smallness\r\n     of the duty shewed revenue to be the object, not the\r\n     discouragement of the importation.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Madison thought it wrong to admit in the Constitution the\r\n     idea that there could be property in men. The reason of duties\r\n     did not hold, as slaves are not like merchandise, consumed &c.\r\n\r\n     Col. Mason (in answr. to Govr. Morris) the provision as it stands\r\n     was necessary for the case of Convicts in order to prevent the\r\n     introduction of them.\r\n\r\n     It was finally agreed nem: contrad: to make the clause read \"but\r\n     a tax or duty may be imposed on such importation not exceeding\r\n     ten dollars for each person\", and then the 2d. part as amended\r\n     was agreed to.\r\n\r\n     Sect 5--art--VII was agreed to nem: con: as reported.\r\n\r\n     Sect 6. art. VII. in the Report was, postponed.\r\n\r\n     Section 9. The Migration or Importation of such Persons as any of\r\n     the States now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be\r\n     prohibited by the Congress prior to the Year one thousand eight\r\n     hundred and eight, but a Tax or duty may be imposed on such\r\n     Importation, not exceeding ten dollars for each Person.[565]\r\n\r\nJames McHenry said before the Maryland House of Delegates in November\r\n29, 1787:\r\n\r\n     Conventions were anxious to procure a perpetual decree against\r\n     the importation of Slaves; but the Southern States could not be\r\n     brought to consent to it--All that could possible be obtained was\r\n     a temporary regulation which the Congress may vary\r\n     hereafter.[566]\r\n\r\n     In 1787 James Wilson said before the Convention called in\r\n     Pennsylvania to ratify the constitution:\r\n\r\n     With respect to the clause restricting Congress from prohibiting\r\n     the migration or importation of such persons as any of the States\r\n     now existing shall think proper to admit, prior to the year 1808,\r\n     the honorable gentleman says that this clause is not only dark,\r\n     but intended to grant to Congress, for that time, the power to\r\n     admit the importation of slaves. No such thing was intended; but\r\n     I will tell you what was done, and it gives me high pleasure that\r\n     so much was done. Under the present confederation, the States may\r\n     admit the importation of the slaves as long as they please; but\r\n     by this article, after the year 1808, the Congress will have\r\n     power to prohibit such importation, notwithstanding the\r\n     disposition of any State to the contrary. I consider this as\r\n     laying the foundation for banishing slavery out of this country;\r\n     and though the period is more distant than I could wish, yet it\r\n     will produce the same kind, gradual change which was pursued in\r\n     Pennsylvania. It is with much satisfaction I view this power in\r\n     the general government, where by they may lay an interdiction on\r\n     this reproachful trade. But an immediate advantage is also\r\n     obtained for a tax or duty may be imposed on such importation not\r\n     exceeding ten dollars for each person; and this, Sir, operates as\r\n     a partial prohibition. It was all that could be obtained. I am\r\n     sorry it was no more; but from this I think there is reason to\r\n     hope that yet a few years, and it will be prohibited altogether.\r\n     And in the meantime, the new States which are to be formed will\r\n     be under the control of Congress in this particular, and slaves\r\n     will never be introduced amongst them. The gentleman says that it\r\n     is unfortunate in another point of view: it means to prohibit the\r\n     introduction of white people from Europe, as this may deter them\r\n     from coming amongst us. A little impartiality and attention will\r\n     discover the care that the convention took in selecting their\r\n     language. The words are, the _migration or_ IMPORTATION of such\r\n     persons, etc., shall not be prohibited by Congress prior to the\r\n     year 1808, but a tax or duty may be imposed on such IMPORTATION.\r\n     It is observable here that the term migration is dropped when a\r\n     tax or duty is mentioned, so that Congress have power to impose\r\n     the tax only on those imported.[567]\r\n\r\nReferring to George Mason's objections to the Constitution, Oliver\r\nEllsworth said:\r\n\r\n     _The general Legislature is restrained from prohibiting the\r\n     further importation of slaves for twenty odd years_.... His\r\n     objections are ... that such importations render the United\r\n     States weaker, more vulnerable, and less capable of defence. To\r\n     this I readily agree, and all good men wish the entire abolition\r\n     of slavery, as soon as it can take place with safety to the\r\n     public, and for the lasting good of the present wretched race of\r\n     slaves. The only possible step that could be taken towards it by\r\n     the convention was to fix a period after which they should not be\r\n     imported.[568]\r\n\r\nIn his \"Genuine Information\" delivered before the Maryland Legislature\r\nNovember 29, 1787, Luther Martin said:\r\n\r\n     (56) By the _ninth_ section of this article, the importation of\r\n     such persons as any of the states now existing shall think proper\r\n     to admit, shall not be prohibited prior to the year one thousand\r\n     eight hundred and eight; but a duty may be imposed on such\r\n     importation, not exceeding ten dollars for each person.\r\n\r\n     (57) The design of this clause is to prevent the general\r\n     government from prohibiting the importation of slaves; but the\r\n     same reasons which caused them to strike out the word\r\n     \"_national_,\" and not admit the word \"_stamps_,\" influenced them\r\n     here to guard against the word \"_slaves_.\" They anxiously sought\r\n     to avoid the admission of expressions which might be odious in\r\n     the ears of of Americans, although they were willing to admit\r\n     into their system those _things_ which the _expressions_\r\n     signified. And hence it is, that the clause is so worded, as\r\n     really to authorize the general government to impose a duty of\r\n     ten dollars on every foreigner who comes into a State to become a\r\n     citizen, whether he comes _absolutely_ free, or _qualifiedly_ so,\r\n     as a servant; although this is contrary to the design of the\r\n     framers, and the duty was only meant to extend to the importation\r\n     of _slaves_.\r\n\r\n     (58) This clause was the subject of a great diversity of\r\n     sentiment in the convention. As the system was reported by the\r\n     committee of detail, the provision was general, that such\r\n     importation should not be prohibited, without confining it to any\r\n     particular period. This was rejected by eight States,--Georgia,\r\n     South Carolina, and I think North Carolina, voting for it.\r\n\r\n     (59) We were then told by the delegates of the two first of\r\n     those States, that their States would never agree to a _system_,\r\n     which put in it the power of the general government to prevent\r\n     the importation of slaves, and that they, as delegates from those\r\n     States, must withhold their assent from such a system.\r\n\r\n     (60) A committee of one member from each State was chosen by\r\n     ballot, to take this part of the system under their\r\n     consideration, and to endeavor to agree upon some report, which\r\n     should reconcile those States. To this committee also was\r\n     referred the following proposition, which had been reported by\r\n     the committee of detail, to wit; \"No _navigation_ act shall be\r\n     passed without the assent of _two thirds_ of the members present\r\n     in each House;\" a proposition which the _staple_ and _commercial\r\n     States_ were solicitous to _retain_, lest their _commerce_ should\r\n     be placed too much under the power of the _eastern_ States; but\r\n     which these last States were as anxious to _reject_. This\r\n     committee, of which also I had the honor to be a member, met and\r\n     took under their consideration the subjects committed to them. I\r\n     found the _eastern_ States, notwithstanding their _aversion to\r\n     slavery_, were very willing to indulge the southern States, at\r\n     least with a temporary liberty to prosecute the _slave-trade_,\r\n     provided the southern States would, in their turn, gratify them,\r\n     by laying _no restrictions on navigation acts_; and after a very\r\n     little time the committee, by a great majority agreed on a\r\n     report, by which the general government was to be prohibited from\r\n     preventing the importation of slaves for a limited time, and the\r\n     restrictive clause relative to navigation acts was to be omitted.\r\n\r\n     (61) This report was adopted by a majority of the convention but\r\n     not without considerable opposition. It was said, that we had\r\n     just assumed a place among independent nations, in consequence of\r\n     our opposition to the attempts of Great Britain to _enslave us_;\r\n     that this opposition was grounded upon the preservation of _those\r\n     rights_ to which God and nature had entitled _us_, not in\r\n     _particular_, but in _common_ with _all the rest of mankind_;\r\n     that we had _appealed_ to the _Supreme Being_ for his\r\n     _assistance_, as the _God of freedom_, who could not but\r\n     _approve_ our efforts to preserve the _rights_ which he had thus\r\n     _imparted to his creatures_; that, now, when we scarcely had\r\n     risen from our _knees_, from _supplicating_ his _aid_ and\r\n     _protection_, in _forming our government_ over a _free people_, a\r\n     government formed pretendedly on the _principles_ of _liberty_\r\n     and for _its preservation_,--in _that_ government, to have a\r\n     provision not only putting it out of _its_ power to _restrain_\r\n     and _prevent_ the _slave-trade_, but _even encouraging that most\r\n     infamous traffic_, by giving the _States power_ and _influence_\r\n     in the _Union, in proportion_ as _cruelly and wantonly sport with\r\n     the rights of their fellow creatures, ought_ to be considered as\r\n     a _solemn mockery_, of an _insult to that God_ whose protection\r\n     we had then implored, and could not fail to hold us up in\r\n     _detestation_, and render us _contemptible_ to every _true\r\n     friend_ of liberty in the world. It was said, it ought to be\r\n     considered that national _crimes_ can only be, and _frequently\r\n     are punished_ in this world, by national punishments; and that\r\n     the _continuance_ of the slave-trade, and thus giving it a\r\n     _national sanction_ and _encouragement_, ought to be considered\r\n     as _justly exposing_ us to the _displeasure_ and _vengeance_ of\r\n     _Him_, who is equally Lord of all, and who views with equal eye\r\n     the poor _African slave_ and his _American master_.\r\n\r\n     (62) It was urged, that, by this system, we were giving the\r\n     general government full and absolute power to regulate commerce,\r\n     under which general power it would have a right to _restrain_, or\r\n     _totally prohibit_, the _slave-trade_; it must, therefore, appear\r\n     to the world absurd and disgraceful to the last degree, that we\r\n     should _except_ from the exercise of that power, the _only\r\n     branch_ of _commerce_ which is _unjustifiable in its nature_, and\r\n     _contrary_ to the rights of _mankind_; that, on the contrary, we\r\n     ought _rather to prohibit expressly_ in our _constitution_, the\r\n     _further importation of slaves_; and to _authorize_ the general\r\n     government, from time to time, to make such regulations as should\r\n     be thought most advantageous for the _gradual abolition of\r\n     slavery_, and the _emancipation_ of the _slaves_ which are\r\n     already in the States: That _slavery_ is _inconsistent_ with the\r\n     _genius_ of _republicanism_, and has a tendency to _destroy_\r\n     those _principles_ on which it is _supported_, as it _lessens_\r\n     the _sense_ of the _equal rights of mankind_, and habituates us\r\n     to _tyranny_ and _oppression_.\r\n\r\n     (63) It was further urged that, by this system of government,\r\n     every State is to be protected both from _foreign invasion_ and\r\n     from _domestic insurrections_; that, from this consideration, it\r\n     was of the _utmost importance_ it should have a power to restrain\r\n     the importation of slaves; since in _proportion_ as the number of\r\n     slaves are increased in any State, in the _same_ proportion the\r\n     State is _weakened_, and _exposed_ to foreign invasion or\r\n     domestic insurrection, and _by so much less_ will it be able to\r\n     protect itself against _either_; and, therefore will by so much\r\n     the more want aid from, and be a burden to the Union. It was\r\n     further said, that as, in this system, we were giving the general\r\n     government a power under the idea of national character, or\r\n     national interest, to regulate even our _weights_ and\r\n     _measures_, and have prohibited all possibility of _emitting\r\n     paper money_, and _passing instalment laws_, &c., it must appear\r\n     still more extraordinary, that we should prohibit the government\r\n     from interfering with the slave-trade than which, _nothing_ could\r\n     so _materially affect_ both our _national honor_ and _interest_.\r\n     These reasons influenced me, both on the committee and in\r\n     convention, most decidedly to oppose and vote against the clause\r\n     as it now makes a part of the system.\r\n\r\n     (64). You will perceive, Sir, not only that the general\r\n     government is prohibited from interfering in the slave-trade\r\n     _before_ the year eighteen hundred and eight, but that there is\r\n     no provision in the constitution that it shall _afterwards_ be\r\n     prohibited, nor any security that such prohibition will ever take\r\n     place; and I think there is great reason to believe, that, if the\r\n     importation of slaves is permitted until the year eighteen\r\n     hundred and eight, it will not be prohibited afterwards. At _this\r\n     time_, we do not generally hold this commerce in so great\r\n     _abhorrence_ as we have done. When our _own_ liberties were at\r\n     stake, we _warmly_ felt for the _common rights of men_. The\r\n     danger being thought to be past, which threatened ourselves, we\r\n     are daily growing _more insensible_ to those rights. In those\r\n     States which have restrained or prohibited the importation of\r\n     slaves, it is only done by legislative acts, which may be\r\n     repealed. When those States find, that they must, in their\r\n     _national character_ and _connexion_, suffer in the _disgrace_,\r\n     and share in the _inconveniences_ attendant upon that detestable\r\n     and iniquitous traffic, they may be desirous also to share in the\r\n     _benefits_ arising from it; and the odium attending it will be\r\n     greatly effaced by the sanction which is given to it in the\r\n     general government.[569]\r\n\r\nIn Elliot's Debates we find the following accredited to General\r\nPinckney.\r\n\r\n     ... The general then said he would make a few observations on the\r\n     objections which the gentleman had thrown out on the restrictions\r\n     that might be laid on the African trade after the year 1808. On\r\n     this point your delegates had to contend with the religious and\r\n     political prejudices of the Eastern and Middle States, and with\r\n     the interested and inconsistent opinion of Virginia, who was\r\n     warmly opposed to our importing more slaves. I am of the same\r\n     opinion now as I was two years ago, when I used the expressions\r\n     the gentleman has quoted--that, while there remained one acre of\r\n     swampland uncleared of South Carolina, I would raise my voice\r\n     against restricting the importation of negroes. I am so\r\n     thoroughly convinced as that gentleman is, that the nature of our\r\n     climate, and the flat, swampy situation of our country, obliges\r\n     us to cultivate our lands with negroes, and that without them\r\n     South Carolina would soon be a desert waste.\r\n\r\n     You have so frequently heard my sentiments on this subject that I\r\n     need not now repeat them. It was alleged, by some of the members\r\n     who opposed an unlimited importation, that slaves increased the\r\n     weakness of any state who admitted them; that they were a\r\n     dangerous species of property, which an invading enemy could\r\n     easily turn against ourselves and the neighboring states; and\r\n     that, as we were allowed a representation for them in the House\r\n     of Representatives, our influence in government would be\r\n     increased in proportion as we were less able to defend ourselves.\r\n     \"Show some period,\" said the members from the Eastern States,\r\n     \"when it may be in our power to put a stop, if we please, to the\r\n     importation of this weakness, and we will endeavor, for your\r\n     convenience, to restrain the religious and political prejudices\r\n     of our people on this subject.\" The Middle States and Virginia\r\n     made us no such proposition; they were for an immediate and total\r\n     prohibition. We endeavored to obviate the objections that were\r\n     made in the best manner we could, and assigned reasons for our\r\n     insisting on the importation, which there is no occasion to\r\n     repeat, as they must occur to every gentleman in the house; a\r\n     committee of the states was appointed in order to accommodate\r\n     this matter, and, after a great deal of difficulty, it was\r\n     settled on the footing recited in the Constitution.\r\n\r\n     By this settlement we have secured an unlimited importation of\r\n     negroes for twenty years. Nor is it declared that the importation\r\n     shall be then stopped; it may be continued. We have a security\r\n     that the general government can never emancipate them, for no\r\n     such authority is granted; and it is admitted, on all hands, that\r\n     the general government has no powers but what are expressly\r\n     granted by the Constitution, and that all rights not expressed\r\n     were reserved by the several states. We have obtained a right to\r\n     recover our slaves in whatever part of America they may take\r\n     refuge, which is a right we had not before. In short, considering\r\n     all circumstances, we have made the best terms for the security\r\n     of this species of property it was in our power to make. We would\r\n     have made better if we could; but, on the whole, I do not think\r\n     them bad.[570]\r\n\r\nMr. Madison said in the Virginia ratifying Convention, June 17, 1787:\r\n\r\n     Mr. Chairman--I should conceive this clause to be impolitic, if\r\n     it were one of those things which could be excluded without\r\n     encountering greater evils.--The southern states would not have\r\n     entered into the union of America, without the temporary\r\n     permission of that trade. And if they were excluded from the\r\n     union, the consequences might be dreadful to them and to us. We\r\n     are not in a worse situation than before. That traffic is\r\n     prohibited by our laws, and we may continue the prohibition. The\r\n     union in general is not in a worse situation. Under the articles\r\n     of confederation, it might be continued forever: But by this\r\n     clause an end may be put to it after twenty years. There is\r\n     therefore an amelioration of our circumstances. A tax may be laid\r\n     in the mean time; but it is limited, otherwise congress might lay\r\n     such a tax on slaves as will amount to manumission. Another\r\n     clause secures us that property which we now possess. At present,\r\n     if any slave elopes to any of those states where slaves are free,\r\n     he becomes emancipated by their laws. For the laws of the states\r\n     are uncharitable to one another in this respect. But in this\r\n     constitution, \"no person held to service, or labor, in one state,\r\n     under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall in\r\n     consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from\r\n     such service or labor; but shall be delivered up on claim of the\r\n     party to whom such service or labor may be due.\"--This clause was\r\n     expressly inserted to enable owners of slaves to reclaim them.\r\n     This is a better security than any that now exists. No power is\r\n     given to the general government to interpose with respect to the\r\n     property in slaves now held by the states. The taxation of this\r\n     state being equal only to its representation, such a tax cannot\r\n     be laid as he supposes. They cannot prevent the importation of\r\n     slaves for twenty years; but after that period they can. The\r\n     gentlemen from South-Carolina and Georgia argued in this\r\n     manner:--\"We have now liberty to import this species of property,\r\n     and much of the property now possessed has been purchased, or\r\n     otherwise acquired, in contemplation of improving it by the\r\n     assistance of imported slaves. What would be the consequence of\r\n     hindering us from it? The slaves of Virginia would rise in\r\n     value, and we would be obliged to go to your markets.\" I need\r\n     not expatiate on this subject. Great as the evil is, a\r\n     dismemberment of the union would be worse. If those states should\r\n     disunite from the other states, for not indulging them in the\r\n     temporary continuance of this traffic, they might solicit and\r\n     obtain aid from foreign powers....\r\n\r\n  (_The 2d, 3d, and 4th clauses read._)\r\n\r\n     ... Mr. _Madison_ replied, that even the southern states, who\r\n     were most affected, were perfectly satisfied with this provision,\r\n     and dreaded no danger to the property they now hold. It appeared\r\n     to him, that the general government would not intermeddle with\r\n     that property for twenty years, but to lay a tax on every slave\r\n     imported, not exceeding ten dollars; and that after the\r\n     expiration of that period they may prohibit the traffic\r\n     altogether. The census in the constitution was intended to\r\n     introduce equality in the burdens to be laid on the\r\n     community.--No gentleman objected to laying duties, imposts, and\r\n     exercises, uniformly. But uniformity of taxes would be subversive\r\n     of the principles of equality: For that it was not possible to\r\n     select any article which would be easy for one state, but what\r\n     would be heavy for another.--...[571]\r\n\r\nIn 1789 Madison said:\r\n\r\n     I conceive the constitution, in this particular, was formed in\r\n     order that the Government, whilst it was restrained from laying a\r\n     total prohibition, might be able to give some testimony of the\r\n     sense of America with respect to the African trade. We have\r\n     liberty to impose a tax or duty upon the importation of such\r\n     persons, as any of the States now existing shall think proper to\r\n     admit; and this liberty was granted, I presume, upon two\r\n     considerations: The first was, that until the time arrived when\r\n     they might abolish the importation of slaves, they might have an\r\n     opportunity of evidencing their sentiments on the policy and\r\n     humanity of such a trade. The other was, that they might be taxed\r\n     in due proportion with other articles imported; for if the\r\n     possessor will consider them as property, of course they are of\r\n     value, and ought to be paid for.[572]\r\n\r\nAccording to Elliot, Spaight said on July 26, 1787:\r\n\r\n     Mr. Spaight answered, that there was a contest between the\r\n     Northern and Southern States; that the Southern States, whose\r\n     principal support depended on the labor of slaves, would not\r\n     consent to the desire of the Northern States to exclude the\r\n     importation of slaves absolutely; that South Carolina and Georgia\r\n     insisted on this clause, as they were now in want of hands to\r\n     cultivate their lands; that in the course of twenty years they\r\n     would be fully supplied; that the trade would be abolished then,\r\n     and that, in the mean time, some tax or duty might be laid on....\r\n\r\n     Mr. Spaight further explained the clause. That the limitation of\r\n     this trade to the term of twenty years was a compromise between\r\n     the Eastern States and the Southern States. South Carolina and\r\n     Georgia wished to extend the term. The Eastern States insisted on\r\n     the entire abolition of the trade. That the state of North\r\n     Carolina had not thought proper to pass any law prohibiting the\r\n     importation of slaves, and therefore its delegation in the\r\n     Convention did not think themselves authorized to contend for an\r\n     immediate prohibition of it....[573]\r\n\r\nIn the House of Representatives on February 12, 1790:\r\n\r\n     Mr. Baldwin was sorry the subject had ever been brought before\r\n     Congress, because it was of a delicate nature as it respected\r\n     some of the States. Gentlemen who had been present at the\r\n     formation of the Constitution could not avoid the recollection of\r\n     the pain and difficulty which the subject caused in that body.\r\n     The members from the Southern States were so tender upon this\r\n     point, that they had well nigh broken up without coming to any\r\n     determination; however, from the extreme desire of preserving the\r\n     Union, and obtaining an efficient Government, they were induced\r\n     mutually to concede, and the Constitution jealously guarded what\r\n     they agreed to. If gentlemen look over the footsteps of that\r\n     body, they will find the greatest degree of caution used to\r\n     imprint them, so as not to be easily eradicated; but the moment\r\n     we go to jostle on that ground, I fear we shall feel it tremble\r\n     under our feet. Congress have no power to interfere with the\r\n     importation of slaves beyond what is given in the ninth section\r\n     of the 1st article of the Constitution; everything else is\r\n     interdicted to them in the strongest terms. If we examine the\r\n     constitution, we shall find the expressions relative to this\r\n     subject cautiously expressed, and more punctiliously guarded than\r\n     any other part, \"The migration or importation of such persons\r\n     shall not be prohibited by Congress.\" But lest this should not\r\n     have secured the object sufficiently, it is declared, in the\r\n     same section, \"That no capitation or direct tax shall be laid,\r\n     unless in proportion to the census;\" this was intended to prevent\r\n     Congress from laying any special tax upon negro slaves, as they\r\n     might, in this way, so burthen the possessors of them as to\r\n     induce a general emancipation. If we go on to the fifth article,\r\n     we shall find the first and fifth clauses of the ninth section of\r\n     the first article restrained from being altered before the year\r\n     1808.[574]\r\n\r\nAccording to George Mason's Account:\r\n\r\n     The constn as agreed to till a fortnight before the convention\r\n     rose was such a one as he wd have set his hand & heart to....\r\n     with respect to the importn of slaves it was left to Congress,\r\n     this disturbed the 2 Souther-most states who knew that Congress\r\n     would immediately suppress the importn of slaves, those 2 states\r\n     therefore struck up a bargain with the 3. N. Engld, states, if\r\n     they would join to admit slaves for some years, the 2\r\n     Southernmost states wd join in changing the clause which required\r\n     2/3 of the legislature in any vote. It was done, these articles\r\n     were changed accordingly, & from that moment the two S. states\r\n     and the 3 Northern ones joined Pen. Jers. & Del. & made the\r\n     majority 8. to 3. against us instead of 8. to 3. for us as it had\r\n     been thro' the whole Convention. under this coalition the great\r\n     principles of the Constn were changed in the last days of the\r\n     Convention.[575]\r\n\r\nThe following debate on this subject took place in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, June 16-20, 1798:\r\n\r\n     Mr. B(aldwin). thought the 9th section, forbidding Congress to\r\n     prohibit the migration, &c., was directly opposed to the\r\n     principles of this bill. He recollected very well that when the\r\n     9th section of the Constitution was under consideration in the\r\n     Convention, the delegates from some of the Southern States\r\n     insisted that the prohibition of the introduction of slaves\r\n     should be left to the State Governments; it was found expedient\r\n     to make this provision in the Constitution; there was an\r\n     objection to the use of the word slaves, as Congress by none of\r\n     their acts had ever acknowledged the existence of such a\r\n     condition. It was at length settled on the words as they now\r\n     stand, \"that the migration or importation of such persons as the\r\n     several States shall think proper to admit, should not be\r\n     prohibited till the year 1808.\" It was observed by some\r\n     gentlemen present that this expression would extend to other\r\n     persons besides slaves, which was not denied, but this did not\r\n     produce any alteration of it....\r\n\r\n     Mr. Dayton (the Speaker) commenced his observations with\r\n     declaring that he should not have risen on this occasion, if no\r\n     allusion had been made to the proceedings in the Federal\r\n     Convention which framed the Constitution of the United States, or\r\n     if the representation which was given of what passed in that\r\n     body, had been a perfectly correct and candid one. He expressed\r\n     his surprise at what had fallen from the gentleman from Georgia\r\n     (Mr. Baldwin) relatively to that part of the Constitution, which\r\n     had been selected as the text of opposition to the bill under\r\n     consideration, viz: \"The migration or importation of such persons\r\n     as any of the States now existing 'shall think proper to admit,\r\n     shall not be prohibited by Congress, 'prior to the year 1808.\" He\r\n     could only ascribe either to absolute forgetfulness, or to\r\n     willful misrepresentation, the assertion of the member from\r\n     Georgia, that it was understood and intended by the General\r\n     Convention that the article in question should extend to the\r\n     importation or introduction of citizens from foreign countries.\r\n     As that gentleman and himself were the only two members of the\r\n     House of Representatives who had the honor of a seat in that\r\n     body, he deemed it his indispensable duty to correct the\r\n     misstatement that had thus been made. He did not therefore,\r\n     hesitate to say, in direct contradiction to this novel\r\n     construction of the article (made as it would seem to suit the\r\n     particular purposes of the opponents of the Alien bill) that the\r\n     proposition itself was originally drawn up and moved in the\r\n     Convention, by the deputies from South Carolina, for the express\r\n     purpose of preventing Congress from interfering with the\r\n     introduction of slaves into the United States, within the time\r\n     specified. He recollected also, that in the discussion of its\r\n     merits no question arose, or was agitated respecting the\r\n     admission of foreigners but, on the contrary, that it was\r\n     confined simply to slaves, and was first voted upon and carried\r\n     with that word expressed in it, which was afterwards upon\r\n     reconsideration changed for '_such persons_,' as it now stands,\r\n     upon the suggestion of one of the Deputies from Connecticut. The\r\n     sole reason assigned for changing it was, that it would be better\r\n     not to stain the Constitutional code with such a term, since it\r\n     could be avoided by the introduction of other equally\r\n     intelligible words, as had been done in the former part of the\r\n     same instrument, where the same sense was conveyed by the\r\n     circuitous expression of 'three fifths of all other persons.'\r\n     Mr. Dayton said that at that time he was far from believing, and\r\n     that indeed until the present debate arose, he had never heard,\r\n     that any one member supposed that the simple change of the term\r\n     would enlarge the construction of this prohibitory provision, as\r\n     it was now contended for. If it could have been conceived to be\r\n     really liable to such interpretation, he was convinced that it\r\n     would not have been adopted, for it would then carry with it a\r\n     strong injunction upon Congress to prohibit the introduction of\r\n     foreigners into newly erected States immediately, and into the\r\n     then existing States after the year 1808, as it undoubtedly does,\r\n     that of slaves after that period....\r\n\r\n     Mr. Baldwin ... observed that he was yesterday obliged to leave\r\n     the House a little before adjournment, and he had understood\r\n     that, in his absence, the remarks which he had made on that point\r\n     a few days ago, in Committee of the Whole, had been controverted,\r\n     and that it had been done with some degree of harshness and\r\n     personal disrespect. What he had before asserted was, that the\r\n     clause respecting migration and importation was not considered at\r\n     the time when it passed in the Convention as confined entirely to\r\n     the subject of slaves. He spoke with the more confidence on this\r\n     point, as there was scarcely one to which his attention had been\r\n     so particularly called at the time. In making the Federal\r\n     Constitution, when it was determined that it should be a\r\n     Government possessing Legislative powers, the delegates from the\r\n     two Southern States, of which he was one, were so fully persuaded\r\n     that those powers would be used to the destruction of their\r\n     property in slaves, that for some time they thought it would not\r\n     be possible for them to be members of it: to that interesting\r\n     state of the subject he had before alluded. In the progress of\r\n     the business, other obstacles occurring, which he need not\r\n     repeat, it was concluded to give to the delegates of those States\r\n     the offer of preparing a clause to their own minds, to secure\r\n     that species of property. He well remembered that when the clause\r\n     was first prepared, it differed in two respects from the form in\r\n     which it now stands. It used the word \"slaves\" instead of\r\n     \"migration\", or \"importation,\" or persons, and instead of \"ten\r\n     dollars,\" it was expressed \"five percent ad valorem on their\r\n     importation,\" which it was supposed would be about the average\r\n     rate of duties under this Government. Several persons had\r\n     objections to the use of the word \"slaves, as Congress had\r\n     hitherto avoided the use of it in their acts, and not\r\n     acknowledged the existence of such a condition. It was expressly\r\n     observed at the time, that making use of the form of expression\r\n     as it now stands, instead of the word slaves, would make the\r\n     meaning more general, and include what we now consider as\r\n     included; this did not appear to be denied, but still it was\r\n     preferred in its present form. He had more confidence than common\r\n     in his recollection on this point, for the reasons which he had\r\n     before stated. He gave it as the result of his very clear\r\n     recollection. Any other member of that body was doubtless at\r\n     liberty to say he did not recollect it. Still that would not\r\n     diminish the confidence he felt on this occasion....[576]\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Robert Walsh November 27, 1817, Madison said:\r\n\r\n     Your letter of the 11th was duly recd, and I should have given it\r\n     a less tardy answer, but for a succession of particular demands\r\n     on my attention, and a wish to assist my recollections, by\r\n     consulting both manuscript & printed sources of information on\r\n     the subjects of your enquiry. Of these, however, I have not been\r\n     able to avail myself, but very partially.\r\n\r\n     As to the intention of the framers of the Constitution in the\r\n     clause relating to \"the migration and importation of persons &c\"\r\n     the best key may perhaps be found in the case which produced it.\r\n     The African trade in slaves had long been odious to most of the\r\n     States, and the importation of slaves into them had been\r\n     prohibited. Particular States however continued the importation,\r\n     and were extremely adverse to any restriction on their power to\r\n     do so. In the Convention the former States were anxious, in\r\n     framing a new constitution, to insert a provision for an\r\n     immediate and absolute stop to the trade. The latter were not\r\n     only averse to any interference on the subject; but solemnly\r\n     declared that their constituents would never accede to a\r\n     constitution containing such an article. Out of this conflict\r\n     grew the middle measure providing that Congress should not\r\n     interfere until the year 1808; with an implication, that after\r\n     that date, they might prohibit the importation of slaves into the\r\n     States then existing, & previous thereto, into the States not\r\n     then existing. Such was the tone of opposition in the States of\r\n     S. Carolina & Georgia, & such the desire to gain their\r\n     acquiescence in a prohibitory power, that on a question between\r\n     the epochs of 1800 & 1808, the States of N. Hampshire, Massatts,\r\n     & Connecticut, (all the eastern States in the convention); joined\r\n     in the vote for the latter, influenced by the collateral motive\r\n     of reconciling those particular States to the power over commerce\r\n     & navigation; against which they felt, as did some other States,\r\n     a very strong repugnance. The earnestness of S. Carolina &\r\n     Georgia was further manifested by their insisting on the security\r\n     in the V. article against any amendment to the Constitution\r\n     affecting the right reserved to them, & their uniting with the\r\n     small states who insisted on a like security for their equality\r\n     in the Senate.\r\n\r\n     But some of the States were not only anxious for a constitutional\r\n     provision against the introduction of Slaves. They had scruples\r\n     against admitting the term \"Slaves\" into the Instrument. Hence\r\n     the descriptive phrase \"migration or importation of persons\"; the\r\n     term migration allowing those who were scrupulous of\r\n     acknowledging expressly a property in human beings, to view\r\n     _imported_ persons as a species of emigrants, whilst others might\r\n     apply the term to foreign malefactors sent or coming into the\r\n     country. It is possible tho' not recollected, that some might\r\n     have had an eye to the case of freed blacks, as well as\r\n     malefactors.\r\n\r\n     But whatever may have been intended by the term \"migration\" or\r\n     the term \"persons\", it is most certain, that they referred,\r\n     exclusively, to a migration or importation from other countries\r\n     into the U. States; and not to a removal, voluntary or\r\n     involuntary, of Slaves or freemen, from one to another part of\r\n     the U. States. Nothing appears or is recollected that warrants\r\n     this latter intention. Nothing in the proceedings of the State\r\n     conventions indicate such a construction there. Had such been in\r\n     the construction it is easy to imagine the figure it would have\r\n     made in many of the states, among the objections to the\r\n     constitution, and among the numerous amendments to it proposed by\r\n     the state conventions, not one of which amendments refers to the\r\n     clause in question.... It falls within the scope of your enquiry,\r\n     to state the fact, that there was a proposition in the\r\n     convention, to discriminate between the old and new States, by an\r\n     article in the Constitution declaring that the aggregate number\r\n     of representatives from the states thereafter to be admitted,\r\n     should never exceed that of the states originally adopting the\r\n     Constitution. The proposition happily was rejected. The effect of\r\n     such a descrimination, is sufficiently evident.[577]\r\n\r\nSpeaking about the meaning of migration, Walter Lowrie of Pennsylvania\r\nsaid in the United States Senate:\r\n\r\n     In the Constitution it is provided that \"the migration or\r\n     importation of such persons as any of the States now existing\r\n     shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the\r\n     Congress prior to the year 1808, but a tax,\" etc. In this debate\r\n     it seems generally to be admitted, by gentlemen on the opposite\r\n     side, that these two words are not synonomous; but what their\r\n     meaning is, they are not so well agreed. One gentlemen tells us,\r\n     it was intended to prevent slaves from being brought in by land;\r\n     another gentleman says, it was intended to restrain Congress from\r\n     interfering with emigration from Europe.\r\n\r\n     These constructions cannot both be right. The gentlemen who have\r\n     preceded me on the same side, have advanced a number of pertinent\r\n     arguments to settle the proper meaning of these words. I, sir,\r\n     shall not repeat them. Indeed, to me, there is nothing more dry\r\n     and uninteresting, than discussions to explain the meaning of\r\n     single words. In the present case, I will only refer to the\r\n     authority of Mr. Madison and Judge Wilson, who were both members\r\n     of the Convention, and who gave their construction to these\r\n     words, long before this question was agitated. Mr. Madison\r\n     observes, that, to say this clause was intended to prevent\r\n     emigration does not deserve an answer. And Judge Wilson says,\r\n     expressly, it was intended to place the new States under the\r\n     control of Congress, as to the introduction of slaves. The\r\n     opinion of this latter gentleman is entitled to peculiar weight.\r\n     After the Convention had labored for weeks on the subject of\r\n     representation and direct taxes--when those great men were like\r\n     to separate without obtaining their object, Judge Wilson\r\n     submitted the provision on this subject, which now stands as a\r\n     part of your Constitution. Sir, there is no man, from any part of\r\n     the nation, who understood the system of our Government better\r\n     than him; not even excepting Virginia, from whence the gentleman\r\n     from Georgia (Mr. Walker) tells us, we have all our great\r\n     men.[578]\r\n\r\nMadison wrote on the same question that year in a letter to Monroe:\r\n\r\n     I have been truly astonished at some of the doctrines and\r\n     declarations to which the Missouri question has led; and\r\n     particularly so at the interpretation put on the terms \"migration\r\n     or importation &c.\" Judging from my own impressions I shd. deem\r\n     it impossible that the memory of any one who was a member of the\r\n     Genl. Convention, could favor an opinion that the terms did not\r\n     _exclusively_ refer to migration & importation, _into the_ U. S.\r\n     Had they been understood in that Body in the sense now put on\r\n     them, it is easy to conceive the alienation they would have there\r\n     created in certain States: and no one can decide better than\r\n     yourself the effect they would had in the State conventions, if\r\n     such a meaning had been avowed by the advocates of the\r\n     Constitution. If a suspicion had existed of such a construction,\r\n     it wd. at least have made a conspicuous figure among the\r\n     amendments proposed to the Instrument.[579]\r\n\r\nThere was very little objection to the provision for the return of\r\nfugitive slaves. On the twenty-ninth of August, it was agreed that:\r\n\r\n     \"If any Person bound to service or labor in any of the United\r\n     States shall escape into another State, He or She shall not be\r\n     discharged from such services or labor in consequence of any\r\n     regulations subsisting in the State to which they escape; but\r\n     shall be delivered up to the person justly claiming their service\r\n     or labor.\"\r\n\r\n     which passed in the affirmative (Ayes--11; noes--0.)\r\n\r\n     It was moved and seconded to strike out the two last clauses of\r\n     the 17 article[580]\r\n\r\nOn the same day when the question came up again:\r\n\r\n     Mr. Butler moved to insert after art: XV. \"If any person bound to\r\n     service or labor in any of the U--States shall escape into\r\n     another State, he or she shall not be discharged from such\r\n     service or labor, in consequence of any regulation subsisting in\r\n     the State to which they escape, but shall be delivered up to the\r\n     person justly claiming their service or labor,\" which was agreed\r\n     to nem: con:[581]\r\n\r\nThe Committee of Style reported:\r\n\r\n     No person legally held to service or labour in one state,\r\n     escaping into another, shall in consequence of regulations\r\n     subsisting therein be discharged from such service or labor, but\r\n     shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service\r\n     or labour may be due.[582]\r\n\r\nOn the thirteenth of September,\r\n\r\n     On motion of Mr. Randolph the word \"servitude\" was struck out,\r\n     and \"service\" (unanimously) inserted, the former being thought to\r\n     express the condition of slaves, & the latter the obligations of\r\n     free persons.[583]\r\n\r\nTwo days later:\r\n\r\n     Art. IV. sect 2. parag: 3. the term \"legally\" was struck out, and\r\n     \"under the laws thereof\" inserted (after the word \"State,\") in\r\n     compliance with the wish of some who thought the term (legal)\r\n     equivocal, and favoring the idea that slavery was legal in a\r\n     moral view----[584]\r\n\r\nThe Constitution provided then:\r\n\r\n     No Person held to Service or Labour in one State, under the Laws\r\n     thereof, escaping into another, shall, in Consequence of any Law\r\n     of Regulation therein, be discharged from such Service or Labour,\r\n     but shall be delivered up on Claim of the Party to whom such\r\n     Service or Labour may be due.[585]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[530] In the preparation of these documents we used the notes and\r\njournals of Yates, McHenry and Madison and the subsequent writings of\r\nthe framers of the Federal Constitution, but these extracts of the\r\nactual proceedings are copied from Farrand's _Records of the Federal\r\nConvention_.\r\n\r\n[531] _Records of the Federal Convention_, I, pp. 31-32.\r\n\r\n[532] _Records of the Federal Convention_, I, pp. 35-38.\r\n\r\n[533] _Ibid._, I, pp. 39-40.\r\n\r\n[534] _Records of the Federal Convention_, I, p. 40.\r\n\r\n[535] _Records of the Federal Convention_, I, pp. 152-153.\r\n\r\n[536] _Ibid._, I, pp. 200-202.\r\n\r\n[537] _Records of the Federal Convention_, I, pp. 205-206.\r\n\r\n[538] _Ibid._, p. 208.\r\n\r\n[539] _Records of the Federal Convention_, I, p. 227.\r\n\r\n[540] _Ibid._, I, p. 243.\r\n\r\n[541] _Records of the Federal Convention_, I, pp. 523, 524.\r\n\r\n[542] _Ibid._, I. p. 542.\r\n\r\n[543] _Records of the Federal Convention_, I, pp. 559-560.\r\n\r\n[544] _Ibid._, I, p. 567.\r\n\r\n[545] _Records of the Federal Convention_, pp. 575-576.\r\n\r\n[546] _Ibid._, I, p. 579.\r\n\r\n[547] _Ibid._, pp. 580-583.\r\n\r\n[548] _Records of the Federal Convention_, I, pp. 580-583.\r\n\r\n[549] _Records of the Federal Convention_, I, pp. 586-588.\r\n\r\n[550] _Records of the Federal Convention_, I, pp. 589-590.\r\n\r\n[551] _Records of the Federal Convention_, pp. 603--605.\r\n\r\n[552] _Ibid._, II, p. 168.\r\n\r\n[553] _Records of the Federal Convention_, pp. 182-183.\r\n\r\n[554] Dickenson thought that unless the number of representatives\r\ngiven the large States was reduced the smaller ones would be\r\nencouraged to import slaves.\r\n\r\nArt: VII. sect. 3. resumed.--Mr. Dickenson moved to postpone this in\r\norder to reconsider Art: Iv. sect. 4. and to _limit_ the number of\r\nrepresentatives to be allowed to the large States.

He was as\r\nwhite as his master, but was born a slave. Upon the death of his first\r\nmaster he fell into the hands of one of the sons who died when Snead\r\nwas about fifteen. His next master was a rather reckless man. Snead's\r\nmaster always promised the slave's mother to give him his freedom as\r\nsoon as the boy could take care of himself, but this was never done.\r\nSnead was sent to school a little by his mother so that he could spell\r\nquite well. He had no religious training but was allowed to attend a\r\nSunday school for colored children. Upon approaching manhood Snead was\r\nput to the cooper's trade, which he learned in five years.\r\n\r\nUp to this time Snead had fared well, but at length his master fell\r\nsick and died without freeing the slave according to his promise.\r\nSnead was then sold to pay the fees of his master's physician, who\r\nlater sold him to a wholesale merchant for $500. In the service of\r\nthis merchant Snead proved to be a much smarter man than many of those\r\nwho worked with him. In later years, however, he had to work so hard\r\nas to injure his health to the extent that he suffered considerably.\r\nMoreover, Snead was never allowed any money and was restricted in his\r\nsocial contact with the people of his group in other parts of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nHe was later sold to another master, being given in exchange for a\r\nwoman, two children and $100. He was still employed in the cooper's\r\ntrade. Required to make only 18 barrels a week and capable of making\r\nmore than twice as many, he began to receive an income of his own\r\nunder the good treatment of his last master. During this period,\r\nhowever, his desire for liberty grew stronger and stronger because of\r\nthe hardships of his people and then he heard of their opportunities\r\nin the free States and in Liberia. He, therefore, made his escape in\r\nJuly, 1851, and reached Canada in safety. After remaining two years in\r\nCanada he decided to enter the employ of the proprietor of the\r\nCataract House on the American side of Niagara Falls. What happened\r\nthen is best told in his own language. He says:\r\n\r\n\"Then a constable of Buffalo came in, on Sunday after dinner, and sent\r\nthe barkeeper into the dining-room for me. I went into the hall, and\r\nmet the constable,--I had my jacket in my hand, and was going to put\r\nit up. He stepped up to me. 'Here, Watson,' (this was the name I\r\nassumed on escaping,) 'you waited on me, and I'll give you some\r\nchange.' His fingers were then in his pocket, and he dropped a quarter\r\ndollar on the floor. I told him, 'I have not waited on you--you must\r\nbe mistaken in the man, and I don't want another waiter's money.' He\r\napproached,--I suspected, and stepped back toward the dining-room\r\ndoor. By that time he made a grab at me, caught me by the collar of my\r\nshirt and vest,--then four more constables, he had brought with him,\r\nsprung on me,--they dragged me to the street door--there was a jamb--I\r\nhung on by the doorway. The head constable shackled my left hand. I\r\nhad on a new silk cravat twice around my neck; he hung on to this,\r\ntwisting it till my toungue lolled out of my mouth, but he could not\r\nstart me through the door. By this time the waiters pushed through the\r\ncrowd,--there were three hundred visitors there at the time,--and\r\nSmith and Graves, colored waiters, caught me by the hands,--then the\r\nothers came on, and dragged me from the officers by main force. They\r\ndragged me over chairs and everything, down to the ferry way. I got\r\ninto the cars, and the waiters were lowering me down, when the\r\nconstables came and stopped them, saying, 'Stop that murderer!'--they\r\ncalled me a _murderer_! Then I was dragged down the steps by the\r\nwaiters, and flung into the ferry boat. The boatmen rowed me to within\r\nfifty feet of the Canada shore--into Canada water--when the head\r\nboatman in the other boat gave the word to row back. They did\r\naccordingly,--but they could not land me at the usual place on account\r\nof the waiters. So they had to go down to Suspension Bridge; they\r\nlanded me, opened a way through the crowd--shackled me, pushed me into\r\na carriage, and away we went. The head constable then asked me 'if I\r\nknew any person in Lockport.' I told him 'no,' Then, 'In Buffalo?'\r\n'No.' 'Well then,' said he, 'let's go to Buffalo--Lockport is too\r\nfar.' We reached Buffalo at ten o'clock at night, when I was put in\r\njail. I told the jailer I wished he would be so good as to tell a\r\nlawyer--to come round to the jail. Mr.---- came, and I engaged him for\r\nmy lawyer. When the constables saw that pretending to know no one in\r\nBuffalo, I had engaged one of the best lawyers in the place, they were\r\nastonished. I told them that 'as scared as they thought I was, I\r\nwanted them to know that I had my senses about me.' The court was not\r\nopened until nine days; the tenth day my trial commenced. The object\r\nwas, to show some evidence as if of murder, so that they could take me\r\nto _Baltimore_. On the eleventh day the claimant was defeated, and I\r\nwas cleared at 10 A.M. After I was cleared, and while I was yet in the\r\ncourt room, a telegraphic despatch came from a Judge in Savannah,\r\nsaying that I was no murderer, but a fugitive slave. However, before a\r\nnew warrant could be got out, I was in a carriage and on my way. I\r\ncrossed over into Canada, and walked thirty miles to the Clifton\r\nHouse.\"--Benjamin Drew, _A North-Side View of Slavery_, pp. 102-104.\r\n\r\nWHITE WOMEN ENSLAVED.--\"A New Hampshire gentleman went down into\r\nLouisiana, many years ago, to take a plantation. He pursued the usual\r\nmethod; borrowing money largely to begin with, paying high interest,\r\nand clearing off his debt, year by year, as his crops were sold. He\r\nfollowed another custom there; taking a Quadroon wife: a mistress, in\r\nthe eye of the law, since there can be no legal marriage between the\r\nwhites and persons of any degree of color: but, in nature and\r\nin reason, the woman he took home was his wife. She was a\r\nwell-principled, amiable, well-educated woman; and they lived happily\r\ntogether for twenty years. She had only the slightest possible tinge\r\nof color. Knowing the law, that the children of slaves are to follow\r\nthe fortunes of the mother, she warned her husband that she was not\r\nfree, an ancestress having been a slave, and the legal act of\r\nmanumission having never been performed. The husband promised to look\r\nto it: but neglected it. At the end of twenty years, one died, and the\r\nother shortly followed, leaving daughters; whether two or three, I\r\nhave not been able to ascertain with positive certainty; but I have\r\nreason to believe three, of the ages of fifteen, seventeen, and\r\neighteen; beautiful girls, with no perceptible mulatto tinge. The\r\nbrother of their father came down from New Hampshire to settle the\r\naffairs; and he supposed, as every one else did, that the deceased had\r\nbeen wealthy. He was pleased with his nieces, and promised to carry\r\nthem back with him into New Hampshire, and (as they were to all\r\nappearance perfectly white) to introduce them into the society which\r\nby education they were fitted for. It appeared, however, that their\r\nfather had died insolvent. The deficiency was very small: but it was\r\nnecessary to make an inventory of the effects, to deliver to the\r\ncreditors. This was done by the brother,--the executor. Some of the\r\ncreditors called on him, and complained that he had not delivered in\r\na faithful inventory. He declared he had. No: the number of slaves was\r\nnot accurately set down: he had omitted the daughters. The executor\r\nwas overwhelmed with horror, and asked time for thought. He went round\r\namong the creditors, appealing to their mercy: but they answered that\r\nthese young ladies were 'a first-rate article,' too valuable to be\r\nrelinquished. He next offered, (though he had himself six children,\r\nand very little money,) all he had for the redemption of his nieces;\r\nalleging that it was more than they would bring in the market for\r\nhouse or field labor. This was refused with scorn. It was said that\r\nthere were other purposes for which the girls would bring more than\r\nfor field or house labor. The uncle was in despair, and felt strongly\r\ntempted to wish their death, rather than their surrender to such a\r\nfate as was before them. He told them, abruptly, what was their\r\nprospect. He declares that he never before beheld human grief; never\r\nbefore heard the voice of anguish. They never ate, nor slept, nor\r\nseparated from each other, till the day when they were taken into the\r\nNew Orleans slave market. There they were sold, separately, at high\r\nprices, for the vilest of purposes: and where each is gone, no one\r\nknows. They are for the present, lost. But they will arise to the\r\nlight in the day of retribution.\"--Harriet Martineau, _Views on\r\nSlavery and Emancipation_, pp. 8-9.\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE SLAVE.--\"A slaveholder, living in Virginia, owned a\r\nbeautiful slave woman, who was almost white. She became the mother of\r\na child, a little boy, in whose veins ran the blood of her master, and\r\nthe closest observer could not detect in its appearance any trace of\r\nAfrican descent. He grew to be two or three years of age, a most\r\nbeautiful child and the idol of his mother's heart, when the master\r\nconcluded, for family reasons, to send him away. He placed him in the\r\ncare of a friend living in Guilford County, North Carolina, and made\r\nan agreement that he should receive a common-school education, and at\r\na suitable age be taught some useful trade. Years passed; the child\r\ngrew to manhood, and having received a good common-school education,\r\nand learned the shoemaker's trade, he married an estimable young white\r\nwoman, and had a family of five or six children. He had not the\r\nslightest knowledge of the taint of African blood in his veins, and no\r\none in the neighborhood knew that he was the son of an octoroon slave\r\nwoman. He made a comfortable living for his family, was a good\r\ncitizen, a member of the Methodist Church, and was much respected by\r\nall who knew him. In course of time his father, the Virginian\r\nslaveholder, died, and when the executors came to settle up the\r\nestate, they remembered the little white boy, the son of the slave\r\nwoman, and knowing that by law--such law!--he belonged to the estate,\r\nand must be by this time a valuable piece of property, they resolved\r\nto gain possession of him. After much inquiry and search they learned\r\nof his whereabouts, and the heir of the estate, accompanied by an\r\nadministrator, went to Guilford County, North Carolina, to claim his\r\nhalf-brother as a slave. Without making themselves known to him, they\r\nsold him to a negro trader, and gave a bill of sale, preferring to\r\nhave a sum in ready money instead of a servant who might prove very\r\nvaluable, but who would, without doubt, give them a great deal of\r\ntrouble. He had been free all his life, and they knew he would not\r\nreadily yield to the yoke of bondage. All this time the victim was\r\nentirely unconscious of the cruel fate in store for him.\r\n\r\n\"His wife had been prostrated by a fever then prevalent in the\r\nneighborhood, and he had waited upon her and watched by her bedside,\r\nuntil he was worn out with exhaustion and loss of sleep. Several\r\nneighbor women coming in one evening to watch with the invalid, he\r\nsurrendered her to their care, and retired to seek the rest he so much\r\nneeded. That night the slave-dealer came with a gang of ruffians,\r\nburst into the house and seized their victim as he lay asleep, bound\r\nhim, after heroic struggles on his part, and dragged him away. When he\r\ndemanded the cause of his seizure, they showed him the bill of sale\r\nthey had received, and informed him that he was a slave. In this rude,\r\nheartless manner the intelligence that he belonged to the African race\r\nwas first imparted to him, and the crushing weight of his cruel\r\ndestiny came upon him when totally unprepared. His captors hurried him\r\nout of the neighborhood, and took him toward the Southern slave\r\nmarkets. To get him black enough to sell without question, they washed\r\nhis face in tan ooze, and kept him tied in the sun, and to complete\r\nhis resemblance to a mulatto, they cut his heir short and seared it\r\nwith a hot iron to make it curly. He was sold in Georgia or Alabama,\r\nto a hard master, by whom he was cruelly treated.\r\n\r\n\"Several months afterward he succeeded in escaping, and made his way\r\nback to Guilford County, North Carolina. Here he learned that his wife\r\nhad died a few days after his capture, the shock of that calamity\r\nhaving hastened her death, and that his children were scattered among\r\nthe neighbors. His master, thinking that he would return to his old\r\nhome, came in pursuit of him with hounds, and chased him through the\r\nthickets and swamps. He evaded the dogs by wading in a mill-pond, and\r\nclimbing a tree, where he remained several days. Dr. George Swain, a\r\nman of much influence in the community, had an interview with him,\r\nand, hearing the particulars of his seizure, said he thought the\r\nproceedings were illegal. He held a consultation with several lawyers,\r\nand instituted proceedings in his behalf. But the unfortunate victim\r\nof man's cruelty did not live to regain his freedom. He had been\r\nexposed and worried so much, trailed by dogs and forced to lie in\r\nswamps and thickets, that his health was broken down and he died\r\nbefore the next term of court.\"--Levi Coffin, _Reminiscences_, pp.\r\n29-31.\r\n\r\nA SLAVE OF ROYAL BLOOD.--\"Among the many persons of color whom I\r\nvisited at Philadelphia, was a woman of singular intelligence and good\r\nbreeding. A friend was with me. She received us with the courtesy and\r\neasy manners of a gentlewoman. She appeared to be between thirty and\r\nforty years of age--of pure African descent, with a handsome\r\nexpressive countenance and a graceful person. Her mother, who had been\r\nstolen from her native land at an early age, was the daughter of a\r\nking, and is now, in her eighty-fifth year, the parent stem of no less\r\nthan 182 living branches. When taken by the slavers, she had with her\r\na piece of gold as an ornament, to denote her rank. Of this she was of\r\ncourse deprived; and a solid bar of the same metal, which her parent\r\nsent over to America for the purchase of her freedom, shared the same\r\nfate. Christiana Gibbons, who is thus the granddaughter of a prince of\r\nthe Ebo tribe, was bought when about fifteen years of age, by a woman\r\nwho was struck by her interesting appearance, and emancipated her. Her\r\nbenefactress left her, at her death, a legacy of 8,000 dollars. The\r\nwhole of this money was lost by the failure of a bank, in which her\r\nlegal trustee (a man of the name of James Morrison, since dead) had\r\nplaced it in his own name. She had other property, acquired by her own\r\nindustry, and affording a rent of 500 dollars a year. Her agent,\r\nhowever, Colonel Myers, though indebted to her for many attentions and\r\nmarks of kindness during sickness, had neglected to remit her the\r\nmoney from Savannah, in Georgia, where the estate is situated; and,\r\nwhen I saw her, she was living, with her husband and son, on the\r\nfruits of her labor.\r\n\r\n\"She had not been long resident in Philadelphia, whither she had come\r\nto escape the numerous impositions and annoyances to which she was\r\nexposed in Georgia. Her husband was owner of a wharf in Savannah,\r\nworth eight or ten thousand dollars. It is much feared that the\r\ngreater part of this property will be lost, or not recovered without\r\ngreat difficulty. I was induced to call upon her, in consequence of a\r\nletter I had received from Mr. Kingsley, of whom I have before spoken.\r\nHe had long been acquainted with her, and spoke of her to me in the\r\nhighest terms; wishing that I should see what he considered a 'good\r\nspecimen of the race.'\r\n\r\n\"We found her, indeed, a very remarkable woman; though it is probable\r\nthat there are many among the despised slaves as amiable and\r\naccomplished as herself. Such, at least, was the account she gave us\r\nof their condition, that we felt convinced of the superiority\r\npossessed by many, in moral worth and intellectual acuteness, above\r\ntheir oppressors.\"--E.

G.\r\nP. Putnam's Sons, New York and London, 1918. Pp. 339. Price $4.00.\r\n\r\nThis is an historical and descriptive work containing facts, figures\r\nand resources about a country ninety per cent of the population of\r\nwhich belongs to the Negro race. It is a detailed account of\r\npractically every interest of concern to the tourist, the merchant,\r\nthe geographer and the historian. It is made still more valuable by\r\nits one hundred and nine illustrations and two maps which clearly\r\ndemonstrate what the United States Government has received in return\r\nfor the purchase price of $25,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe first effort of the author is to give a short sketch of the\r\nhistory of the Virgin Islands. He then takes up the question of\r\npurchasing the islands. In discussing these political and historic\r\nquestions, however, the author is too brief and neglectful of\r\nimportant problems which the student of history would like to know.\r\nThe author no doubt carefully avoided these questions for the reasons\r\nthat he was then and still is in the diplomatic service of the United\r\nStates. The book is chiefly concerned with the actual government of\r\nthe group, the occupations of the people, and the place of the islands\r\nin the commerce of the world.\r\n\r\nLargely interested, therefore, in those things which generally concern\r\na consul, Mr. Zabriskie has written a valuable commercial treatise. He\r\nexplains such things as steamer service, harbor facilities, banking,\r\ncurrency, sanitation, transportation, cattle raising, agriculture,\r\nmanufactures, imports and exports. The last part of the book is\r\nexclusively devoted to the most recent history of the Virgin Islands.\r\nThere is a discussion of the sale negotiations, the convention between\r\nthe United States and Denmark, the announcement of the sale, the\r\nformal transfer of the islands, the farewell service and the temporary\r\ngovernment provided. This part of the book is not merely descriptive.\r\nIt contains the actual documents as in the case of the convention\r\nbetween the United States and Denmark, which is given in the English\r\nand Danish languages.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Your Negro Neighbor._ By BENJAMIN BRAWLEY. The Macmillan Company, New\r\nYork, 1918. Pp. 100. Price 60 cents.\r\n\r\nIn this book Dean Brawley does not reach the standard set in some of\r\nhis other works, but he has here some facts and suggestions which are\r\nworth while. The book begins with an appeal to the people of the\r\nUnited States in behalf of the Negroes who, despite their many\r\ngrievances, are now fighting to make the world safe for democracy\r\nalthough their own country is not safe for them. In directing these\r\nremarks to the citizens of this country the author gives in detail the\r\nNegroes' grounds for complaint and shows how because of the unjust\r\ntreatment of the blacks in the United States this country has become\r\nan object of suspicion in South America, where the color line is not\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nThe second chapter of the book is a statement of the Negroes' place in\r\nhistory. This, however, is too brief and unscientific to be of much\r\nvalue to one in quest of facts of Negro history. It seems unnecessary\r\nhere also to devote a special chapter to such isolated facts of\r\nhistory in writing a book dealing with a social problem.\r\n\r\nThe chapter bearing on the Negro as an industrial factor contains\r\ninteresting material taken from statistical reports. The author\r\ndiscusses such questions as the reliability of Negro laborers, the\r\nantagonism of the labor unions, housing conditions, and the like.\r\nTaking up the institution of lynching, Dean Brawley goes over old\r\nground but gives striking facts to portray this blot on the American\r\ncivilization. Then without showing any close connection between the\r\ntwo the author takes up Negro education since the Civil War. Here we\r\nsee another failure to treat an important question intensively and\r\nscientifically. He then gives a sketch of Joanna P. Moore, a\r\nmissionary of much worth, takes up certain critics and their\r\nfallacies, asserts the possibility of the race and closes with a plea\r\nfor a moralist.\r\n\r\nThis in brief is the work recently produced by a man who is\r\nundertaking to address the American people on almost every phase of\r\nNegro life and history. This work, however, is merely the author's\r\nobservations or impressions of the Negroes among the whites. The very\r\nwork itself shows that Dean Brawley is undertaking too much. He is\r\nbest as a literary critic but in sociology and history his works do\r\nnot measure up to standard.\r\n\r\n                                   ORVILLE HOLLIDAY.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The American Cavalryman._ By HENRY F. DOWNING. The Neale Publishing\r\nCompany, New York, 1917. Pp. 306. Price $1.50.\r\n\r\nThis is a Liberian romance written by Henry F. Downing, a colored man\r\nwho evidently spent some years in Liberia. The diction is good, the\r\nstyle pleasing, and the story interesting, but it is not a sympathetic\r\nportrayal of African character and customs. It is written from a white\r\nman's point of view and shows a tendency to regard the white man's\r\ncivilization of today as the only true standard. He shows, however,\r\nthat he does not always approve of the European method of dealing with\r\nthe African. While describing an unequal contest between the\r\ncavalryman and natives, he says: \"But alas! in war, as in finance and\r\nlove, victory does not always smile upon the most deserving. She\r\nusually favors the numerically stronger side; that is, unless the less\r\nnumerous party is armed with quick firing guns, dumdum bullet, and\r\nother harmless weapons that Europeans think it criminal to employ\r\nagainst one another, but cheerfully use to Christianize and civilize\r\nthe poor helpless black African.\"\r\n\r\nThe chief value of the work lies in its portrayal of native customs,\r\nsome of which are beautiful, some wholly barbarous and all more or\r\nless tinctured with superstition. But, when we pause to think how rife\r\nsuperstition still is among all so-called civilized peoples, we\r\nconclude that it is a belief hard to eradicate from human nature. Even\r\nin our own country people were hanged as witches a little over a\r\nhundred years ago.\r\n\r\nWhile cunning and shrewdness are shown to hold an exalted place in the\r\nnative character, still lying and cheating, when discovered, are\r\nseverely punished. Loyalty to friends and fidelity to pledges are held\r\nin great esteem. Human life does not seem to be valued very highly\r\njudging from the readiness with which a chief extinguished it by\r\nhaving all disloyal or disobedient followers beheaded at a moment's\r\nnotice. It is evident throughout, however, that human nature is the\r\nsame in civilized and uncivilized peoples.\r\n\r\nThere is no attempt to portray the history of Liberia in these pages,\r\na thing which in my opinion would have made the work stronger and far\r\nmore valuable. It does give a fair picture of Monrovia, the capital\r\ncity, and presents, to some extent, the need for wise and just\r\nadministration and the necessity of funds to improve the city and\r\nendow it with parks, libraries, and places of amusement. The value of\r\nthe American constabulary force is felt and the importance of\r\nincreased communications, union and helpfulness between the\r\ngovernment and the tribes are emphasized. Altogether it is a work\r\nworth writing and worth reading, although it does not give enough\r\nprominence to the nobler traits of the native character.\r\n\r\n                                   IDA GIBBS HUNT.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Education for Life._ By FRANCIS G. PEABODY, Vice-President of the\r\nBoard of Trustees. The Story of Hampton Institute, told in Connection\r\nwith the Fiftieth Anniversary of the School. Doubleday, Page and\r\nCompany, New York, 1918. Pp. 393. Price $2.50.\r\n\r\nThis work has for its background a brief account of the Negro during\r\nthe Civil War and the Reconstruction, serving as the occasion for the\r\nbeginning of the successful career of General Samuel Chapman\r\nArmstrong, the founder of Hampton Institute. The actual history of the\r\ninstitution appears under such captions as the beginnings of Hampton,\r\nthe years of promise, the coming of the Indian, the years of\r\nfulfilment, the end of an era, the coming of Frissell, and the\r\nexpansion of Hampton. The author has endeavored also to explain the\r\nrelations of Hampton and the South and to forecast the future\r\npossibilities of this school. The work is well printed and beautifully\r\nillustrated.\r\n\r\nIn the _Springfield Republican_ of July 6, 1918, A. L. Dawes said in\r\nher review of this work:\r\n\r\n\"Hampton institute has chosen a fitting occasion, the completion of\r\nfifty years of life and work, to issue the history of its achievement.\r\nIt comes at the end of one distinct epoch, and the beginning of\r\nanother, when it is of much value to consider the results which make a\r\nfoundation for new progress. It is a record of wonderful achievement,\r\nand this amazing institution may well be proud of it. We are led from\r\nthe huddled camp of contrabands in 1868 to the allied armies in 1918;\r\nfrom a crowd of men and women without a past and seemingly without a\r\nfuture--even a possibility only to the eyes of patriotism and\r\nfaith--we are led in these pages to the ranks of efficient soldiers\r\nand brilliant officers fighting with southern men whose grandfathers\r\ncalled their grandfathers slaves!\r\n\r\n\"Faith has become pride and patriotism has become an individual\r\npossession in a resurrected race. The book might well have been called\r\nby that title--'The Resurrection of a Race'--but its distinguished\r\nauthor, in calling it 'Education for Life,' has chosen to consider\r\nHampton's double mission to the race and to the world in connection\r\nwith education. This latter aspect of its work makes the book\r\nparticularly pertinent at this time of world reconstruction. This\r\nattractive volume will be read with interest and satisfaction by the\r\nmany widespread friends of Hampton Institute, and it will also be\r\nsought with eagerness by another audience, the large public, which is\r\nseeking new theories of education for a new world. This group will\r\nfind it a clear and compelling statement of a new philosophy of\r\neducation worked out there, heretofore neither recognized nor\r\nunderstood outside, but limited either to manual training or\r\nvocational education.\r\n\r\n\"Hampton has been fortunate in its biographer. It is a labor of love,\r\nby Rev. Francis G. Peabody, one of the few remaining trustees whose\r\nservice covers its three epochs and whose friendship has inspired its\r\nthree principals. Perhaps no one else has so entered into the life of\r\nthe place. He has made himself one with pupils and faculty and\r\ntrustees and public in such friendly fashion that he may rightly say\r\n'we' from any point of view. His many readers will look for noteworthy\r\ndiction amounting to a new use of words, grace of speech and charm of\r\nphrase, a startling power of insight, a passion for social service and\r\nthe revelation of the spiritual in all human affairs, with the\r\ninspiration which compels. These things Dr. Peabody's readers expect\r\nof him, but it might have been questioned whether he could write a\r\nhistory. In this book he has shown us that history is the story of\r\nlife, and he has used all these abilities to discover and fitly\r\nexpress the life which has become Hampton Institute. Not the least of\r\nall his skill has appeared in what he has left out--so that the book\r\nis never dull though it is crowded with facts. Everything is here that\r\nis needed to answer the questions of any objector, and what is more\r\ndifficult, of any friend. The illustrations are not only interesting,\r\nbut valuable footnotes to history, and there are a number of\r\ncollections of statistics at the end of the book of incomparable worth\r\nto the student of these subjects; we cannot enough commend their range\r\nand selection.\r\n\r\n\"Among the rest, we notice a just commendation of the Hampton Club in\r\nthis city. All through the book explanation forestalls objection,\r\nwhile old friends find new information and new reasons for\r\nhalf-understood methods. Such are the accumulating exposition of the\r\nHampton idea, and the description of circumstances and resources which\r\ncondition all action, and determine the measure of progress. Those who\r\nknow and love this wonderful place will be gratified at the stress\r\nlaid on the 'Hampton spirit' of service as the explanation of its\r\nsuccess, as well as the constant recognition of the spiritual in the\r\nmethods as well as the aims of this hothouse of missionary effort. No\r\none familiar with the school would have found the record complete\r\nwithout the stressing of this element at once its motive and its life.\r\nFew could have so well defined that elusive but forceful thing--'the\r\nHampton spirit.'\r\n\r\n\"It needed all the writer's ability to set forth fitly the ardent\r\nArmstrong and the able Frissell--witness his success in this\r\ncharacterization of them:\r\n\r\n\"'Never were two administrative officers more unlike each other.\r\nArmstrong was impetuous, magnetic, volcanic; Frissell was reserved,\r\nsagacious, prudent. The gifts of the one were those of action; the\r\nstrength of the other was in discretion.'\r\n\r\n\"He has given us all fresh knowledge of both men. By his choice and\r\ncollocation of extracts he shows Armstrong not only to have had the\r\nenthusiastic impact on his world known to all men, but also a\r\nforelooking philosophy which guided him to a definite end. He brings\r\nout the long line of unusual circumstances which prepared him for this\r\nwork, and in repeating the vision in which like a Hebrew prophet the\r\nyoung officer was called to teach the Negroes, the writer shows that\r\nwork to have been a definite growth. No one who knew Samuel C.\r\nArmstrong can ever forget him, or ever describe him, but not one of\r\nhis wide circle ever failed to be moved by any contact with him to put\r\nforth his own powers to their full measure.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Peabody does full justice to the help and service of the\r\nFreedmen's Bureau, which from the first linked the institution with\r\nthe government, and to the American Missionary Association, which made\r\nits beginning possible. He further shows many missionary and\r\nphilanthropic sources upon which it has always drawn. If he halts a\r\nlittle in enthusiastic justice to Gen. Benjamin F. Butler, who began\r\nthis crusade, he has evidently done it best--an unexpected best it\r\nmust be said, from a Harvard professor! Samuel Armstrong was moved by\r\nhis Christian impulses and missionary inheritance to help these needy\r\npeople, but there could hardly have been a more unpromising\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\n\"The task which Armstrong took up was greater than the present\r\ngeneration can imagine. Dr. Peabody has recognized this by a clear and\r\ndispassionate description of the situation in 1868, an analysis of the\r\ngreatest value to the present-day reader. Armstrong's high courage\r\nand faith brought him to the day when he saw the race well on the high\r\nroad to its place in the sun, before he dropped his mantle on the\r\nshoulders of his successor. It is doubtful, perhaps, whether he saw\r\nclearly how much he had done nor how firmly he had established his\r\nprinciples of the necessity of work and respect for it. Dr. Peabody\r\nbrings out very distinctly this his great achievement, but it is\r\nsuperfluous to quote from a story which everyone will want to read for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\"Mindful of the fact that education depends upon personal contact,\r\nthis book deals largely with the work of the two outstanding\r\npersonalities, who have made the institution what it is. Hollis Burke\r\nFrissell, who took up the work of principal when Armstrong left it\r\ntwenty-five years ago--'Dr. Frissell' as everyone knew him--proved to\r\nbe in some ways one of the great men of his time, certainly so if you\r\ngive a high value to education. As one of his close friends has said\r\nof him, 'He invariably grew to the measure of the stature that his\r\nwork called for.'\r\n\r\n\"If Dr. Peabody has failed at all in the hard task of describing one\r\nin whom the full round of qualities blended into the white light of\r\nsimplicity it is perhaps in not making his virility sufficiently\r\nevident. The first and last impression Frissell made was of\r\nlovableness, and he was so intent on getting work done that he never\r\ncared to be known as its author. Therefore, even his friends did not\r\nalways discover his strength or sometimes his greatness. He carried on\r\nthe school to a phenominal success and he developed more than one\r\nbeginning to a definite policy.\r\n\r\n\"In the latter part of Gen. Armstrong's career a simple occurrence\r\nchanged the whole character of the school. From it the school\r\ndeveloped into a world institution. When the government asked Gen.\r\nArmstrong to continue the education of seventeen Indians already begun\r\nby Capt. Pratt, the task was undertaken as a civil and Christian duty,\r\nbut thus was started a government policy, and an educational\r\nexperiment which, carried on and broadened to other races under Dr.\r\nFrissell, has changed the face of our own land and altered the\r\nconditions of backward races the world over. Because of this great\r\nhistorical fact, Hampton should always keep up its Indian department,\r\nwhich witnesses to the beginning of its world relation.\r\n\r\n\"The passing of time after the Civil War and emancipation also made\r\npossible to Dr. Frissell the development of another policy, that of\r\nthe unification of the North and the South. This was something very\r\nnear his heart, and for it he started the southern education\r\nboard--which was his creation more fully than Dr. Peabody\r\nexplains--the Jeans board, much of the southern work of the\r\nRockefeller or general educational board and other well-known agencies\r\nto this end. And to accomplish the reconciliation of the races and the\r\nregions he gave the vital force which finally cost him his life. The\r\nfuture will render this service its due meed of praise, as the writer\r\nso well sets forth, a service carried on in the midst of\r\nmisunderstanding and sharp criticism.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Peabody has devoted himself especially on bringing out the growth\r\nof Dr. Frissell's carefully-thought-out educational ideals, whereby he\r\nadded the value of work to the necessity of it in a complete\r\neducation. Under Frissell, as is so well shown, Hampton entered on its\r\nsecond stage, its relation to the philosophy of education. Men came\r\nfrom all over the world to study the question of the training of\r\nnative races. Inspired by his work, Frissell saw the possibilities on\r\nevery side, and looked far into the future. Thus, as has been said,\r\nhis set purpose broadened the school to include Porto Rico, Cuba, the\r\nPhilippines, and even Africa, making it what he loved to call it, a\r\n'race laboratory.' That he succeeded appears in the constant stream of\r\nofficials, educators and philanthropists from all over the globe\r\ncoming to Hampton that they may study and copy its methods. The vision\r\nof the future which was given to Dr. Frissell was not so much a vision\r\nof a new race, as with Armstrong; it was for Frissell a vision of a\r\nnew humanity.\r\n\r\n\"It is this vision of 'Education for life' which Dr. Peabody brings\r\nout so clearly--both its meaning and its value. The oldest friends of\r\nHampton have hardly understood it before, so well does he explain it,\r\nand so thoroughly does he show that its purpose is to make men and\r\nwomen. Artisans and skilled workmen come out of it, but its first\r\npurpose is to develop individuals and all its interests tend to this\r\nend. This explains its limitations also, and answers many complaints.\r\nThe white teacher who recently left because there was 'no future' for\r\nher own career; the educator who complained of a system which\r\ncontinued to educate on general lines when some vocational diversion\r\nwould be more profitable; those who support the objections of the\r\n'Crisis' that Hampton is not a university--all these critics fail to\r\nunderstand the new philosophy of Hampton and its dominant human\r\nmotive. It would be a great mistake if, as appears to be hinted here,\r\nany concessions should be made to the demand of these last critics,\r\nwhose aims would destroy the whole idea of Hampton, and its value as\r\na world experiment. The author of the book and distinguished student\r\nof social ethics so strongly brings out its claim to a new education,\r\nfor a new world that (to repeat) the reader cannot fail to inquire if\r\nthis is the solution of the future in our forthcoming new world.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Peabody brings us to the beginning of the third era and pays a\r\ndeserved tribute to the new principal. Rev. James E. Gregg, who enters\r\non the task at a critical time. Just now, when the race question is\r\nacute both here and everywhere, and when the new democracy is\r\ndemanding a new education, there could hardly be a greater opportunity\r\nfor the man or the school.\r\n\r\nThis inadequate sketch of a most informing and inspiring book may well\r\nbe closed with a few paragraphs which sum up the aims of Hampton\r\nInstitute:\r\n\r\n\"'In short, the fundamental issue in all education for life is between\r\na training to make things and a training to make character. Is a man\r\nto be taught carpentering primarily that a house shall be well built,\r\nor that in the building the man himself shall get intelligence,\r\nself-mastery and skill?'\r\n\r\n\"'The principle was definitely accepted that these shops and classes\r\nwere maintained, not as sources of profit, but as factors in an\r\neducation for life. Young men and women were not to be regarded as\r\nsatisfactory products of Hampton Institute because each could do one\r\nthing and get good wages for doing it, but because each had been\r\ntrained to apply mind and will to the single task, and had made it not\r\nonly a way of living, but a way of life.'\r\n\r\n\"'Trade education as conceived gradually developed and finally\r\nrealized at Hampton Institute is a development of the person through\r\nthe trade, rather than a development of the trade through the person.\r\nThe product is not primarily goods, but goodness; not so much profit\r\nas personality.... These students become delivered from the benumbing\r\nconditions of modern industry by the emancipating and humanizing\r\neffect of the Hampton scheme of industrial training, and those who are\r\nthus initiated in a large view of their small opportunities are likely\r\nto find their way, not only to those occupations, which are still open\r\nat the top, but to those resources of happiness which are discovered\r\nwhen work has become a vocation, and labor has contributed to life.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the introduction to Book II of _Negro Folk-Songs_ the author, Mrs.\r\nNatalie Curtis Burlin, has some interesting paragraphs showing the\r\nconnection of this music with certain origins in Africa. She says:\r\n\r\n\"That Negro folk-song is indeed an offshoot from an African root,\r\nnobody who has heard Africans sing or even beat the drum can deny. The\r\nAmerican Negroes are sprung, of course, from many tribes; but whereas\r\nthe native traffic in slaves and captives brought individuals from\r\nwidely separated parts of the continent to the coasts and thus to the\r\nEuropean slavers, the great mass of Negroes that filled the slave\r\nships destined for America probably belonged--according to some\r\nauthorities--to the big linguistic stock called Bantu, comprising some\r\nfifty million people south of the equator. The Zulu and Ndau tribes,\r\nwhose songs I studied, are of this stock. Yet, as there are over a\r\nhundred million Negroes on the Dark Continent, whose different traits\r\nare probably represented in some form in this country, all statements\r\nas to musical derivations could be made with final authority only by\r\none who had studied comprehensively the music of many different tribes\r\n_in Africa_. This much, however, one may most emphatically affirm:\r\nthough the Negro, transplanted to other lands, absorbed much musically\r\nfrom a surrounding civilization, yet the characteristics which give to\r\nhis music an interest worthy of particular study are precisely those\r\nwhich differentiate Negro songs from the songs of the neighboring\r\nwhite man; they are racial traits, and the black man brought them from\r\nthe Dark Continent.\r\n\r\n\"The most obvious point of demarcation between Negro music and\r\nEuropean is found, of course, in the rhythm. The simpler rhythms\r\nnatural to the white man (I speak of folk-music, the people's song,\r\nnot of the elaborate creations of trained musicians) are usually even\r\nand symmetrical. Throughout western Europe and in English and Latin\r\ncountries, the accents fall as a rule on the stressed syllables of the\r\nspoken tongue and on the regular beats of the music. The opposite is\r\nthe case in Negro songs: here the rhythms are uneven, jagged, and, at\r\na first hearing, eccentric, for the accents fall most frequently on\r\nthe short notes and on the naturally _unstressed_ beats, producing\r\nwhat we call 'syncopation' of a very intricate and highly developed\r\norder. The peculiarity of this syncopation is best explained to the\r\nlayman by drawing attention to the way in which the natural rhythms of\r\nthe English language are distorted to fit the rhythm of Negro music:\r\nwhere the white man would sing, '_Go down Moses_,' the Negro chants,\r\n'_Go down, Moses_,' while a phrase like '_See my Mother_,' becomes in\r\nthe mouth of the colored singer '_See my Mother_.' These identical\r\naccents are found in even the wordless vowel refrains of native\r\nAfrican songs. Rhythmically the Negro folk-song has far more variety\r\nof accent than the European; it captivates the ear and the imagination\r\nwith its exciting vitality and with its sense of alertness and\r\nmovement. For this reason Negro rhythms and white man imitations of\r\nthem popularized as 'rag-time' have spread far and wide and have\r\nconquered the world to-day. The black man has by nature a highly\r\norganized rhythmic sense. A totally uneducated Negro, dancing or\r\nplaying the bones, is often a consummate artist in rhythm, performing\r\nwith utter abandon and yet with flawless accuracy. My African\r\ninformant, Kamba Simango, thought nothing of singing one rhythm,\r\nbeating another with his hands and dancing a third--and all at once!\r\n\r\n\"Melodically as well as rhythmically, American Negro songs possess\r\ndistinct characteristics. One of these is a very prevalent use of the\r\npentatonic or five-tone scale, corresponding to the black keys of the\r\npiano. If one comes upon a group of colored men unconsciously humming\r\nor whistling at work, most often it is the five-tone scale that utters\r\ntheir musical thoughts. This scale--along with other scales--is heard\r\nin black Africa also, and in the music of many simple peoples in\r\ndifferent parts of the world. Indeed, just as totally unrelated races\r\nat certain stages of culture seem to trace many of the same\r\nrudimentary symbols and designs on pottery and in textiles, so in\r\nmusic, the archaic simplicity of the five-tone scale would seem almost\r\na basic human art-instinct. Yet the highly developed civilization and\r\nthe carefully defined musical systems of China and other nations of\r\nthe farthest East retain the pentatonic scale in wide use, the Chinese\r\nin their philosophical and mystical theories of music, linking the\r\nfive-tones symbolically with the heavenly bodies. It is surprising how\r\nmuch variety can be achieved with those five tones. One of the most\r\ngraceful melodies that I know in all music is the popular Chinese\r\n'lily Song' which I recorded from a Chinese actor and which possesses\r\nthe sheer beauty of outline and the firm delicacy of a Chinese\r\ndrawing. Indeed, the melodic possibilities of the five-tone scale,\r\ncontaining a charm absolutely peculiar to that scale, instead of being\r\nlimited, seem almost endless.\r\n\r\n\"American Negro music, is however, by no means restricted to this\r\ntonality, for we find a broad indulgence in the major and minor modes\r\nof modern art, and also there are many songs in which occur tones\r\nforeign to those scales most common of which is perhaps the minor, or\r\nflat, seventh. Then, too, there are songs framed in the scale with a\r\nsharp fourth; and we also find, though more rarely in Negro music, the\r\naugmented interval of three semitones. Those of us who have noted\r\nArabic folk-songs are accustomed to associate this latter interval\r\nwith Semitic music; occurring as it does in African music also it\r\nreminds us of the contact between the black population of Africa and\r\nthe Semitic peoples in the white north of the continent whose caravan\r\ntrade brought them into communication with the more savage interior,\r\nwhile their ships touched at ports along the coasts and even landed\r\ncolonists on the Eastern shores, where Arab trade across the Red Sea\r\nmust have existed since early Bible times. As the age-old slave\r\ntraffic brought captives from African tribes out from the heart of\r\nblack Africa to the north, we can readily see how, since the very dawn\r\nof history, Negro and Semitic cultures must have touched. One of the\r\nBantu legends in my collection from Portuguese East Africa is probably\r\nof Semitic origin, and the song which it embodies seems also tinged\r\nwith foreign color. Without doubt, Semitic tunes and musical intervals\r\nfound their way to African ears, while, on the other side, African\r\nNegro drum-beats and syncopations must have influenced Berber, Moorish\r\nand thus perhaps even Spanish rhythms.\r\n\r\n\"Another characteristic of the Negro, musically, is a harmonic sense\r\nindicating musical intuition of a high order. This instinct for\r\nnatural polyphony is made clear in the recording of the Negro songs in\r\nthis collection, wherein I have noted the four-part harmony as sung\r\nextemporaneously by colored boys who had had no musical training\r\nwhatever. Some of the most beautiful improvisational part-singing that\r\nI ever heard arose from the throats of utterly illiterate black\r\nlaborers in a tobacco factory. One has but to attend a colored church,\r\nwhether North or South, to hear men and women break naturally into\r\nalto, tenor or bass parts (and even subdivisions of these), to realize\r\nhow instinctively the Negro musical mind thinks harmonies. I have\r\nheard players in colored bands perform one part on an instrument and\r\nsing another while all those around him were playing and singing still\r\ndifferent parts. Yet it has been asserted by some people that the\r\nharmonic sense of the Negro is a product of white environment and that\r\nthe black man owes his intuitive gift to the slave-holders who sang\r\nhymns, ballads and popular songs in his hearing! With all due\r\nallowance for white influence, which has been great, of course, the\r\nfact remains that in savage Africa, remote from European culture, many\r\nof the most primitive pagan songs are sung in parts with elaborate\r\ninterludes on drums tuned to different pitches. Indeed the music of\r\nthe Dark Continent is rich in polyphonic as well as rhythmic\r\nsuggestions for the European. Perhaps the war may help to prick some\r\nof the vanity of the white race, which, looking down with self-assumed\r\nsuperiority upon other races, is quick to condemn delinquencies as\r\nnative characteristics, and to ascribe to its own influences anything\r\nworthy; whereas the reverse is, alas, all too often the case.\r\nCertainly the art of Africa, of India, of the Orient and of North\r\nAmerica owes to the Anglo-Saxon only corruption and commercialization.\r\nAs for American Negro music, those songs that are most like the music\r\nof the white people--and they are not few--are the least interesting;\r\nthey are sentimental, tame, and uneventful both in melody and rhythm.\r\nOn the other hand, such melodies as 'Go down Moses,' 'Four and Twenty\r\nEiders on Their Knees,' 'Run, Mary, Run,' these speak from the very\r\nsoul of the black race and no white man could have conceived them.\r\nThey have a dignity barbaric, aloof and wholly individual which lifts\r\nthem cloud-high above any 'White' hymns that the Negro might have\r\noverheard. Austere as Egyptian bas-relief, simple as Congo sculpture,\r\nthey are mighty melodies, and they are Negro.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nD.
