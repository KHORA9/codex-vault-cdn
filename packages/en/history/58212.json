M.A. F.S.A.\r\n  LATE ONE OF THE KNIGHTS OF THE SHIRE FOR THE COUNTY OF WARWICK.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n  WESTMINSTER:\r\n  JOHN BOWER NICHOLS AND SONS.\r\n  Third Edition, Corrected 1866.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That noble families are continued in a long succession of wealth,\r\nhonour, and reputation, is justly esteemed as one of the most\r\nvaluable of worldly blessings, as being the certain tokens of God\r\nAlmighty's providential favour, and the prudent conduct of such\r\nancestors,\"--Nath. Johnston's _Account of the Family of Bruce Earl\r\nof Aylesbury_, 1691, Harl. MS, 3879.\r\n\r\nTHE following imperfect attempt to bring together a few notes\r\nrelating to the ancient aristocracy of England, is confined in the\r\nfirst place to the families _now existing_, and regularly\r\nestablished either as _knightly_ or _gentle_ houses before the\r\ncommencement of the sixteenth century; secondly, no notice is taken\r\nof those families who may have assumed the name and arms of their\r\nancestors in the _female line_: for the truth is, as it has been\r\nwell observed,* \"that, unless we take the _male line_ as the general\r\nstandard of genealogical rank, we shall find ourselves in a hopeless\r\nstate of confusion;\" thirdly, illegitimate descent is of course\r\nexcluded; and, fourthly, where families have sold their original\r\nestates, they will be noticed in those counties where they are at\r\npresent seated; if however they still possess the ancient estate of\r\ntheir family, though they may _reside_ in another county, they will\r\nbe mentioned for the most part under that county from whence they\r\noriginally sprung.\r\n\r\nIn those cases where the whole landed estate of the family has been\r\ndissipated, although the male line still remains, all notice is\r\nomitted, such families having no longer any claim to be classed in\r\nany county. For, \"ancient dignity was territorial rather than\r\npersonal, the whole system was rooted in the land, and, even in the\r\npresent day, though the land may have changed hands often, it has\r\ncarried along with it some of that sentiment of regard attached to\r\nthe lordship of it, as surely as its earth has the fresh smell which\r\nit gives when upturned by the husbandman.\"**\r\n\r\nThis list also, it must be remembered, does not profess to give an\r\naccount of all those families whose descent may possibly be traced\r\nbeyond the year 1500, but merely of those who were in the position\r\nof what we now call _county families_ before that period. The line\r\nof demarcation indeed between the families who rose upon the ruins\r\nof the monastic system, and the more ancient aristocracy of England,\r\nis often very difficult to be traced, depending as it does on\r\ndocumentary evidence often inaccessible, and obscured by the\r\nfanciful and too favourable deductions of the heralds of the\r\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the sources from whence the following memoranda have\r\nbeen taken, I have endeavoured as much as possible to rely upon the\r\nbest county histories and MS. collections of authority, and\r\ncarefully to eschew those modern accounts of family history, which,\r\nby ascribing the most absurd pretensions of ancient lineage to\r\nfamilies who bore no _real_ claim to that distinction, have done\r\nmuch to bring genealogy itself into contempt among that numerous\r\nclass of readers who are but slightly acquainted with the subject.\r\n\r\nI cannot conclude without recording my obligations to several\r\ngentlemen who have in the most liberal manner placed their\r\ngenealogical collections at my service, and by so doing rendered\r\nless imperfect these notices of the noble and gentle houses of\r\nEngland: among that number I wish particularly to mention the names\r\nof the late Mr. Joseph Morris of Shrewsbury and Mr. Joseph Hunter,\r\none of the Assistant Keepers of the Records, the learned and\r\naccurate historian of South Yorkshire.\r\n                                               E.P.S.\r\n\r\n  Lower Eatington, July 1, 1860.\r\n\r\n  * Quarterly Review, Jan. 1858, p. 37.\r\n  ** Quarterly Review, Jan. 1858, p. 31.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION.\r\n\r\nANOTHER edition of this little work having been called for, I have\r\ncarefully revised and corrected what has been already written; I\r\nhave also made some additions, the result of further investigation,\r\nand the information of many friends and correspondents, whose\r\ncourtesy and kindness I here beg most gratefully to acknowledge.\r\n\r\nSince the book was published in the year 1859, the male lines of\r\nthree families, whose names were originally comprehended in it, have\r\nbecome extinct, viz.: Cotton of Landwade, in the county of\r\nCambridge, Hornyold of Blackmore Park, and Hanford of Wollashill,\r\nboth in Worcestershire. On the other hand, notices of eight \"_new\r\npeers?_\" will be found in the present volume, four of which also\r\noccurred in the second edition. I allude to Lovett of Liscombe, in\r\nthe county of Buckingham, and Basset of Tehidy, in the county of\r\nCornwall--very ancient families, whose landed property being until\r\nlately in female hands, could not, in accordance with the rules\r\nwhich I had laid down, be comprehended in the first edition; I have\r\nalso added Huyshe of Sand, in Devonshire, Patten of Bank Hall,\r\nin Lincolnshire, Bertie of Uffington, Anderson of Brocklesby, and\r\nMassingberd of Wrangle, all in Lincolnshire, and, lastly, Upton of\r\nAshton Court, in the county of Somerset. And here I must again beg\r\nto remind the reader, that the intention of this work is not to give\r\nan account of every family whose pedigree may be continued in the\r\nmale line beyond the time which I have mentioned (the beginning of\r\nthe sixteenth century), but of those only who were established as\r\n_county families_, \"inheriting arms from their ancestors,\" at that\r\nperiod. It is no doubt in many cases very difficult to distinguish\r\naccurately the pretensions of many families who may possibly have a\r\nfair claim to this distinction, though, from the reasons to which I\r\nhave formerly alluded, it is not easy to establish them. I can only\r\nsay that as far as my information extends I have endeavoured fairly\r\nand honestly to draw the correct line, but whether I have succeeded\r\nmust be left to the judgment of others.\r\n                                              E. P. S.\r\n\r\n  Lower Eatington, January 22, 1866.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"An ancient estate should always go to males. It is mighty foolish\r\nto let a stranger have it because he marries your daughter and takes\r\nyour name. As for an Estate newly acquired by trade, you may give\r\nit, if you will, to the dog _Towser_, and let him keep his _own_\r\nname.\"--DR.

Basing in Hampshire, Stanton\r\nSt.John in Oxfordshire, Bletshoe in the county of Northampton,\r\nand Lydiard Tregoze in Wiltshire, both derived from the heiress of\r\nBeauchamp in the reign of Henry VI.--have successively been seats of\r\nthe St.Johns, who have made themselves sufficiently remarkable both\r\nfor their loyalty and disloyalty in the reign of Charles I., not to\r\nmention the ambition and ill-directed abilities of the great Lord\r\nBolingbroke in that of Anne.\r\n\r\n_Younger Branch_. St.John of Lydiard Tregoze, Viscount Bolingbroke\r\n1712. Baronet 1611. Descended from Oliver, second son of Sir Oliver\r\nSt.John and the heiress of Beauchamp.\r\n\r\nSee Leland's Itinerary, edition 1769, vol. vi. folio 27, p. 26.\r\nBrydges's Collins, vi. 42 and 741. For an account of Bletshoe, and\r\nthe monuments there, see Gent. Mag. 1799, p. 745. For Lydiard\r\nTregoze, and other monuments of the St.Johns, whose pedigree, by Sir\r\nR. St.George, is painted on folding-doors on the north side of the\r\nchancel, see the Topographer, i. 508.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Argent, on a chief gules two mullets pierced or_. William de\r\nSt.John in the thirteenth century bore in his arms the addition of a\r\nbend gules, which was continued by his descendants till the reign of\r\nElizabeth. (Gent. Mag. 1787, 681.) The present coat was borne by Sir\r\nJohn de St.John in the reign of Edward II.; at the same time other\r\nmembers of the family varied the field and charges thus: Sir Roger\r\nbore, _Ermine, on a chief gules two mullets or_; Sir Eymis, _Argent,\r\ncrusilly sable, on a chief gules two mullets or_; Sir John de\r\nLayneham, _Argent, on a chief gules two mullets or, a border\r\nindented sable_. John, heir of John de St.John, differenced his arms\r\nwith a label azure, according to the roll of Carlaverock. The roll\r\nof arms of the reign of Richard II. gives the _mullets of six points\r\npierced azure_. Edward St.John at this period bore, _Argent, on a\r\nchief dancetté gules two mullets of six points or, pierced vert_.\r\nRolls of the dates.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, St.Andrew Beauchamp St.John, 14th Baron\r\nSt.John.\r\n\r\n  * \"Hungry Time hath made a glutton's meal on this Catalogue of\r\n    Gentry (the List of Gentry of the reign of Henry VI,) and hath\r\n    left but a very little morsel for manners remaining.\" Fuller,\r\n    Worthies of Bedfordshire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n+Gentle.+\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLHILL OF HOWBURY, IN THE PARISH OF RENHOLD.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] This family is of ancient Kentish extraction, and is\r\na branch of the Polhills or Polleys of Preston, in Shoreham, in that\r\ncounty, descended from John Polhill, eldest son of John Polhill and\r\nAlice de Buckland, the heiress of Preston, in the reign of Henry VI.\r\nThe Rev. Richard Polwhele, the Historian of Cornwall, was of opinion\r\nthat the Polhills of Kent were a branch of the Cornish Polwheles,\r\nwhich emigrated from the western into the eastern counties at a very\r\nearly period; they were certainly seated at Detling in\r\nHollingbourne, in Kent, at or previous to the reign of Edward III.\r\nIn the time of Elizabeth, the Polhills were of Frenches, in the\r\nparish of Burwash, in Sussex. The immediate ancestor of the present\r\nfamily was Nathaniel Polhill, of Burwash and Howbury, an eminent\r\nmerchant, who died in 1782.\r\n\r\nSee a very minute account of all the branches of this ancient family\r\nin the Topographer and Genealogist, i. pp. 180 and 577. See also\r\nHasted's History of Kent, vol. i, p. 365, and vol. iii. p. 4.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Or, on a bend gules three cross-crosslets of the first_. It\r\nappears by the Roll of Arms of the reign of Richard II., that Monsr.\r\nRauff Poley bore a coat nearly similar, viz, _Argent, on a bend\r\ngules three crosses patée or_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Frederick Polhill, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBERKSHIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Gentle.+\r\n\r\n\r\nEYSTON OF EAST HENDRED.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] It has been observed by old Fuller, \"The Lands of\r\nBerkshire are very skittish, and are apt to cast their owners;\" and\r\nagain, \"Of names which were in days of yore--few remain here of a\r\ngreat store.\" The ancient family of Eyston, and the succeeding one\r\nof Clarke, are indeed the only exceptions at the present day to this\r\nrule. The Eystons have been seated at East Hendred since the reign\r\nof Henry VI.; John Eiston, their ancestor, having at that period\r\nmarried \"Isabel, daughter and heir of John Stow, of Burford, co.\r\nOxford, whose wife was Maud, daughter and heir of Rawlin Arches, of\r\nEast Henreth, whose great-grandmother was Amy, daughter and heir of\r\nRichard Turbervill, of East Henreth, Esq.\"\r\n\r\nSee the Visitation of Berks, 1566.

The\r\n    extinct family of Darell of Littlecote, Wiltshire, for which see\r\n    the Topographer, ii. 101, and the Darells of Richmond, Baronet,\r\n    1795, are sprung from the house of Calehill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRENVILLE OF WOTTON UNDER BARNWOOD, DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM 1822,\r\nMARQUESS OF BUCKINGHAM 1782, EARL TEMPLE 1749, VISCOUNT AND BARON\r\nCOBHAM 1718.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] There is good reason to believe that this family,\r\nseated at Wotton from the reign of Henry I., is a collateral branch\r\nof the Grenvilles of the West. The manor of Wotton, among many\r\nothers, was given by William I. to Walter Giffard, Earl of\r\nBuckingham. Isabel, daughter and coheir of Walter the second Earl,\r\nis said to have brought it in marriage, about the year 1097, to\r\nRichard de Grenville.\r\n\r\nThe consequence of this family in modern times is owing to matches\r\nwith the heiresses of the great houses of Temple, Nugent, and\r\nChandos.\r\n\r\nSee Brydges's Collins's Peerage, ii. p. 390, and Lysons, p. 673. See\r\nalso Moule's Bibliotheca Herald, p. 563, for an account of the MS.,\r\nformerly at Stowe, viz. The original Evidences of the Grenville\r\nFamily, collected by Richard Grenville, of Wotton, Esq. during the\r\ncivil wars of the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Vert, on a cross argent five torteauxes_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Richard Plantagenet Campbell\r\nTemple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 3rd Duke of\r\nBuckingham.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHARCOURT OF ANKERWYCKE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] On the decease of the last Earl Harcourt, in 1830,\r\nthe representation in the male line of the illustrious House of\r\nHarcourt devolved on this family, descended from a younger brother\r\nof Simon, first Viscount Harcourt, and the heiress of Lee. Stanton\r\nHarcourt, in the county of Oxford, was possessed by the ancestors of\r\nthis great House in 1166, and continued in the family till the\r\nextinction of the elder line in 1830. The pedigree is traced to\r\nRobert de Harcourt, who married Joan, daughter of Robert Beaumont,\r\nEarl of Mellent, and who was grandson of Robert who attended William\r\nthe Conqueror in his expedition to England in 1066.\r\n\r\nSee Brydges's Collins's Peerage, iv. p. 428; and Nichols's\r\nLeicestershire, iv. pt. 2. p. 519.*\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Gules, two bars or_. This coat was borne by Sir John de\r\nHarcourt in the reign of Edward II. Thomas Harecourt, the reverse,\r\nin the reign of Richard II. Rolls of the period.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, George Simon Harcourt, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n+Gentle.+\r\n\r\n\r\nLOVETT OF LISCOMBE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] Vitalis Lovett of Rushton, in the county of\r\nNorthampton, who lived in the reign of Henry II., appears to be the\r\nfirst proved ancestor of this venerable family, said to be of Norman\r\norigin. William Lovett of Rushton, the son of Vitalis, held certain\r\nlands in Henwick, also in Northamptonshire, of Richard Engaine and\r\nhis heirs by the service of finding two horsemen to follow the said\r\nRichard to hunt the wolf in any part of England. This service was\r\nremitted to John Lovet, son or grandson of William, in the reign of\r\nEdward I., and in lieu thereof an annual rent-charge of ten\r\nshillings was imposed. Soon after this period, viz: in 1304, (33\r\nEdw. I.) Liscombe in the parish of Soulbury came into the family,\r\nbeing in the possession of Robert Lovett and Sarah his wife,\r\ndaughter and heir of Sir Roger Turvile, from the second marriage of\r\ntheir son Thomas, descended the Lovetts of Astwell in\r\nNorthamptonshire, since the reign of Elizabeth represented in the\r\nfemale line by the Shirleys Earls Ferrers. Liscombe has from the\r\nbeginning of the fourteenth century remained the inheritance of the\r\nelder branch of the Lovetts, though the direct descent has been\r\noften interrupted. In 1781, Jonathan Lovett, the representative of\r\nthe family, was created a baronet by King George III. His Majesty's\r\nremark on this occasion is preserved in Betham's Baronetage. \"In the\r\nsummer of 1781, the Earl of Chesterfield having been some time\r\nabsent from court, was asked by the King where he had been so\r\nlong? 'On a visit to Mr. Lovett of Buckinghamshire,' said the\r\nEarl. 'Ah,' said the King, 'is that Lovett of Liscombe? They are of\r\nthe genuine old Norman breed, how happens it that they are not\r\nbaronets? would they accept the title? Go tell him,' continued the\r\nKing, 'is that the title is much at his service; they have ever\r\nstuck to the Crown at a pinch.'\" The same work also gives a very\r\ncurious, and to an antiquary very tantalizing, account of the\r\nancient armour and documents once preserved at Liscombe, and\r\ndescribes their melancholy fate. Sir Jonathan Lovett having died\r\nwithout surviving male issue in 1812, the title of Baronet became\r\nextinct and the property descended to his daughters; on the decease\r\nof the survivor, Miss Eliza Lovett, in 1861, the ancient seat of\r\nthis venerable family reverted by her will to the next male heir,\r\nthe present representative of the family, descended from a younger\r\nbrother of Sir Jonathan Lovett, baronet.\r\n\r\nSee Baker's Northamptonshire, i. p. 732; Lipscombe's\r\nBuckinghamshire, iii. p. 457; Stemmata Shirleiana, pr. pr., 1841, p.\r\n58; Collectanea Topog. et Genealog. vi. p. 300, and Betham's\r\nBaronetage.\r\n\r\nARMS.--Evidently allusive to the name, and to the service of hunting\r\nthe wolf, _Argent, three wolves passant in pale sable, armed and\r\nlangued gules_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Jonathan Vaughan Lovett, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGESHIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Gentle.+\r\n\r\n\r\nBENDYSHE OF BARRINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] The name is local, from Bendish, in the parish of\r\nRadwinter, in Essex, where Peter Westley was seated at a very early\r\nperiod. His grandson was called Ralf of Westley, alias Bendishe, and\r\nfrom him this ancient family, one branch of which was long settled\r\nat Steeple Bumstead, in Essex, is descended. A manor in Barrington\r\ncame from the heiress of Bradfield early in the fifteenth century,\r\nand had acquired the name of \"The Manor of Bendyshe\" so far back as\r\nthe year 1493; it has ever since remained the inheritance of this\r\nthe eldest line of the Bendyshe family, of whom a younger branch was\r\nof Topfield Hall, in Hadley, co. Suffolk, whose heiress married\r\nDoyley of Overbury, also of Steeple Bumstead before mentioned,\r\ncreated Baronet in 1611, extinct in 1717; and other branches again\r\nwere of Hadley and Turvey in Bedfordshire.\r\n\r\nSee Lysons's Cambridgeshire, p. 86, and the Visitation of Essex\r\n1612, Harl. MS. 6095, fol. 16, where is a good pedigree of Bendyshe,\r\nbrought down to William Bendyshe, Esq. tenth in descent from Peter\r\nWestley.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Argent, a chevron sable between three ram's heads erased\r\nazure_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, John Bendyshe, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHESHIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Knightly.+\r\n\r\n\r\nDAVENPORT OF WOODFORD.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] The Davenports claim precedence among the knightly\r\nfamilies of Cheshire,--that \"seed-plot of gentry,\" \"the mother and\r\nthe nurse of the gentility of England,\" and are traced directly to\r\nthe Conquest. The elder line, which Leland terms \"the best and first\r\nhouse of the Davenports at Devonport; a great old house covered with\r\nleade on the Ripe of Daven, three miles above Congleton,\" became\r\nextinct in 1674. The coheiresses married Davies and Davenport of\r\nWoodford. Ormus de Daumporte, living in the time of William I., is\r\nthe first recorded ancestor of this family. To his son, Richard de\r\nDauneporte, Hugh Earl of Chester gave the chief foresterships of the\r\nforests of Leek and Macclesfield about 1166, a feudal office still\r\nheld by this house.\r\n\r\nThe present family are sprung from Nicholas, third son of Sir John\r\nor Jenkin Davenport, of Wheltrough and Henbury, who was himself a\r\nyounger son of Thomas, second son of Sir Thomas Davenport of\r\nDavenport, the 13th of Edward II. Woodford was granted by John\r\nStafford and Isabella his wife, about the time of Edward III., to\r\nJohn, third son of Thomas Davenport of Wheltrough, (an elder line\r\nnot traced beyond 1677,) while the Davenports of Henbury were\r\nextinct before 1664. Davenport of Calveley, founded by Arthur, sixth\r\nson of Sir John Davenport of Davenport, killed at Shrewsbury in\r\n1403, became extinct in 1771. The coheiresses married Bromley\r\nand Davenport of Woodford. Davenport of Bramhall, founded by the\r\nsecond son of Thomas Davenport of Wheltrough and the heiress of\r\nBramhall, in the time of Edward III., survived till 1838. The\r\nDavenports of Davenport House, in the parish of Worfield, in\r\nShropshire, are the only younger branch now remaining; they spring\r\nfrom the Davenports of Chorley and the heiress of Bromley of Hallon\r\nor Hawn, in the parish of Worfield. See Blakeway's Sheriffs of\r\nSalop, pp. 85, 143, 228.\r\n\r\nFor Davenport of Davenport and Woodford, see Ormerod's Cheshire,\r\niii. 39, 346, 357; for those of Calveley, ib. ii. 153; Henbury, iii.\r\n352; Bramhall, iii. 401; Chorley, iii. 312.

The Grosvenors of Eaton descend from\r\nRalph second son of Sir Thomas Grosvenor of Hulme, who married Joan,\r\nsole daughter and heir of John Eaton, of Eton or Eaton, Esq. early\r\nin the fifteenth century. The match of Sir Thomas Grosvenor, Bart.\r\nin 1676, with Mary, sole daughter and heir of Alexander Davies, of\r\nEbury, in the county of Middlesex, Esq. laid the foundation of the\r\ngreat wealth and consequent honours of this family.\r\n\r\nYounger branches: the Earl of Wilton 1801; the Baron Ebury 1857.\r\n\r\nSee Ormerod, ii. 454, and iii. 87; Brydges's Collins, v. 239; and\r\nthe Scrope and Grosvenor Roll _passim_.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Azure, a garb or_, used since the sentence of the Court in\r\nthe cause of Sir Richard le Scrope and Sir Robert le Grosvenor in\r\n1389, instead of _Azure, a bend or_, and allusive to his descent\r\nfrom the ancient Earls of Chester.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Marquess of\r\nWestminster, K.G.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEGERTON OF OULTON, BARONET 1617.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] This is the principal male branch of the great House\r\nof Egerton, formerly Earls and Dukes of Bridgewater and Earl of\r\nWilton. The pedigree begins with Philip Goch, second son of David de\r\nMalpas, surnamed le Clerk, which David was lord of a moiety of the\r\nBarony of Malpas. The present family is descended from Sir Philip\r\nEgerton, third son of Sir Rowland Egerton, of Egerton and Oulton,\r\nBaronet, who died in 1698. The Baronetcy devolved on Sir John\r\nEgerton, uncle of the present Baronet, on the death of the Earl of\r\nWilton, and extinction of the elder line, in 1814. Oulton came from\r\nthe heiress of Hugh Done, anno 1498. It is thus mentioned in\r\nLeland's Itinerary: \"The auncientest of the Egertons dwellith now at\r\nOldeton, and Egerton buildith ther now.\" (Itin. vii. fol. 42.)\r\nYounger branch, Egerton-Warburton, of Warburton and Arley, in this\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\nSee Wotton's Baronetage, i. 271; Brydges's Collins, iii. 170, v.\r\n528; Ormerod, ii. 118, 350; and for many curious particulars of the\r\nBridgewater Egertons, see the Topographer, ii. 136, &c.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Argent, a lion rampant gules between three pheons sable_.\r\nThe pheons were the ancient arms of Malpas; the lion was added by\r\nUryan Egerton, about the middle of the fourteenth century; according\r\nto tradition, an augmentation granted as a reward for his services\r\nin the Scotch wars.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Sir Philip de Malpas Grey-Egerton, 10th\r\nBaronet, M. P. for S. Cheshire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHOLMONDELEY OF CHOLMONDELEY, MARQUESS OF CHOLMONDELEY 1815, EARL OF\r\nCHOLMONDELEY 1706, BARON 1689.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] Descended with the Egertons from the Barons of\r\nMalpas, and immediately from Robert de Cholmondelegh, second son of\r\nWilliam Belward, lord of a moiety of the Barony of Malpas, and\r\nyounger brother of David the ancestor of the Egertons; which Robert\r\nwas seated at Cholmondeley in the reign of King John.\r\n\r\nYounger branches. Cholmeley of Whitby, in Yorkshire, Baronet\r\n1641, extinct 1688; descended from Robert, younger son of Hugh\r\nCholmondeley, temp. Edw. III. See the Memoirs of Sir Hugh Cholmeley,\r\nKnight and Baronet, a curious book privately printed in\r\n1787.--Cholmeley of Brandsby, since the extinction of the Whitby\r\nfamily the only representative of the Cholmondeleys of\r\nYorkshire.--Cholmeley of Easton, co.

Lincoln,\r\nwho died in 1620.\r\n\r\nCholmondeley of Vale Royal in this county, Baron Delamere 1821,\r\ndescended from Thomas, younger son of Sir Hugh Cholmondeley of\r\nCholmondeley, who died in 1501.\r\n\r\nSee Ormerod, ii. 356, and for Cholmondeley of Vale Royal, ii. 78.\r\nBrydges's Collins, iv. 16.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Gules, two helmets in chief argent, garnished or, and in\r\nbase a garb of the third_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, George Horatio Cholmondeley, 2nd Marquess of\r\nCholmondeley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTATTON, CALLED EGERTON OF TATTON, BARON EGERTON OF TATTON 1859.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] Robert Tatton of Kenworthy, in Northenden, who\r\nmarried the heiress of William de Withenshaw, alias Massey, about\r\nthe latter end of the reign of Edward III., is the first _proved_\r\nancestor of this family, but there is reason to believe that he was\r\ndescended from the much more ancient house of the name who were\r\nseated at Tatton in the twelfth century. Withenshaw, now the seat of\r\nthe younger branch of this family, remained from the period above\r\nmentioned the inheritance and residence of the Tattons, until\r\nthe decease of Samuel Egerton, Esq. in 1780, when the estate of\r\nTatton, which is supposed to have given name to the family, devolved\r\nby his will on William Tatton of Withenshaw, Esq., who had married\r\nHester, sister of Mr. Egerton. Tatton had passed to the Egertons\r\nthrough the families of Tatton, Massey, Stanley, and Brereton.\r\n\r\nYounger branch, Tatton of Withenshaw, in this county. See Ormerod,\r\niii. 315, and Gentleman's Magazine 1798, 930.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Quarterly argent and gules, four crescents counterchanged_.\r\nThe arms are perhaps founded on the coat of Massey.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, William Tatton Egerton, Baron Egerton of\r\nTatton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUNBURY OF STANNEY, BARONET 1681.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] A family of great antiquity, descended from Henry de\r\nBoneberi, in the time of Stephen, a younger brother of the House of\r\nSt. Pierre in Normandy. William de Boneberi, son of Henry, was Lord\r\nof Boneberi in the reign of Richard I. But the direct ancestor was\r\nDavid brother of Henry, whose great-grandson Alexander de Bunbury\r\nwas living in the fifteenth of Henry III. Stanney, still the\r\ninheritance, but not the residence, of the Bunburys, came from the\r\nheiress of the same name in the seventeenth of Edward III.\r\n\r\nSee Ormerod, ii. 216, and Wotton's Baronetage, iii. 687.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Argent, on a bend sable three chessrooks of the field_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Sir Charles James Fox Bunbury, 8th\r\nBaronet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEYCESTER OF TOFT.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] Descended from Sir Nicholas Leycester, who acquired\r\nthe manor of Nether-Tabley in marriage, and died in 1295. The male\r\nline of the eldest branch of this family, established at\r\nNether-Tabley, became extinct in 1742. The present and younger\r\nbranch springs from Ralph, younger brother of John Leycester of\r\nTabley, who married Joan, daughter and heir of Robert Toft of Toft:\r\nshe was a widow in 1390. The antiquary Sir Peter was of the Tabley\r\nline.\r\n\r\nYounger branch, Leycester of Whiteplace, co. Berks.\r\n\r\nSee Ormerod, i. 385, 456; iii. 190.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Azure, a fess or, fretty gules, between two fleurs-de-lis of\r\nthe second_. Another coat was granted by Dethick to Sir Ralph\r\nLeycester of Toft, the second year of Edward VI., viz. _Sable, on a\r\nfess engrailed between three falcons volant argent, beaked and\r\nmembered or, a lion's head caboshed azure between two covered cups\r\ngules_. But this very unnecessary and overloaded coat does not\r\nappear to have been used.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Ralph Oswald Leycester, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMASSIE OF CODDINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] The pedigree in Ormerod begins with Hugh Massie, who\r\nmarried Agnes, daughter and heir of Nicholas Bold, of Coddington.\r\nTheir son William purchased the manor of Coddington in the\r\neighteenth of Henry VI. The parentage of Hugh Massie is a matter of\r\ndispute, but he was probably a younger son of Sir John Massie of\r\nTatton, who died in the eighth of Henry. He is also by others\r\nsupposed to have been descended from the Massies of Podington, a\r\nyounger branch of the Barons of Dunham Massey. This family is\r\nperhaps the only remnant in the direct male line of the posterity of\r\nany of the Cheshire Barons. General Massie, a younger son of this\r\nhouse, was a distinguished officer in the Civil Wars, both in the\r\nservice of the Commonwealth and in that of Charles II.\r\n\r\nYounger branches: Massey of Pool-Hall, in this county, descended\r\nfrom the second son of Massie of Coddington, who was born in 1604.\r\nFrom Edward the third son descended the Massies of Rosthorne, also\r\nin Cheshire, now extinct. For the extinct branches of Broxton and\r\nPodington, see Ormerod, ii. 372 and 308; for Massie of Coddington,\r\nii. 399; for Massie of Pool-Hall, iii. 188.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Quarterly gules and or, in the first and fourth three\r\nfleurs-de-lis argent, a canton of the third_. There was a dispute\r\nabout the arms of Massey between the Houses of Tatton and Podington\r\n(for which see \"The Scrope and Grosvenor Roll,\" vol. ii. p. 262),\r\nwhich was decided in 1378 by the arbitration of Sir Hugh Calveley\r\nand others. The present coat, except that the first and second\r\nquarters were or, and the canton omitted, was awarded to Massey of\r\nPodington. Massey of Tatton bore the same arms with three escallops\r\nargent in lieu of the fleurs-de-lis. The elder line of Dunham bore\r\n_Quarterly or and gules, in the second quarter a lion passant\r\nargent_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Richard Massie, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILBRAHAM OF DELAMERE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] This family represents the eldest branch of the\r\nWilbrahams of Cheshire, descended from Richard de Wilburgkam,\r\nsheriff of this county in the forty-third year of Henry III. In the\r\nthird of Edward IV. the Wilbrahams were seated at Woodhay, in\r\nCheshire, by a match with the heiress of Golborne: this, the elder\r\nline, created Baronet in 1620-1, was extinct in 1692. The\r\npresent family are descended from the second son of Thomas Wilbraham\r\nof Woodhay, and were seated at Townsend in Nantwich in the reign of\r\nElizabeth; they removed to Delamere the latter part of the\r\neighteenth century.\r\n\r\nYounger branches: Wilbraham Baron Skelmersdale 1828; and Wilbraham\r\nof Rode, in this county, both descended from Randle, younger brother\r\nof Roger Wilbraham, of Nantwich, who died in 1754. Wilbraham of\r\nDorfold, sold in 1754, but existing at Falmouth in 1818, was sprung\r\nfrom the youngest son of Richard Wilbraham, of Nantwich, who died in\r\n1612. See Ormerod, ii. 65; iii. 31, 184, 199.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Argent, three bends wavy azure_. The Dorfold branch bore for\r\ndistinction _a canton gules_. Additional coat, granted by Flower,\r\ntemp. Eliz.; _Azure, two bars argent, on a canton of the first a\r\nwolf's head erased of the second_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, George Fortescue Wilbraham, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEGH OF EAST HALL, IN HIGH LEGH.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] Efward de Lega, who appears from his name to have\r\nbeen of Saxon origin, and who lived at or near the period of the\r\nConquest, was the patriarch of this ancient family, of which the\r\nprincipal male line failed in the time of Edward IV. Thomas Legh, of\r\nNorthwood, in the same parish of High-Legh, the ancestor of the\r\npresent family, succeeded after a long litigation as the next heir\r\nmale in the reign of Henry VIII. See Ormerod, i. 358.\r\n\r\nARMS.--Allowed 1566. _Argent, a lion rampant gules, armed and\r\nlangued azure_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, George Cornwall Legh, Esq. M.P. for North\r\nCheshire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEIGH OF WEST HALL, IN HIGH LEGH.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] Descended from Richard de Lymme, younger son of Hugh\r\nde Lymme, which Richard in the latter part of the thirteenth century\r\nmarried Agnes, daughter and sole heir of Richard de Legh,\r\ngreat-grandson of Hamon de Legh, the first mentioned in the\r\npedigree. Richard de Lymme had issue Thomas de Legh, of West Hall,\r\nliving in 1305.\r\n\r\nYounger branches: Leigh (called Trafford), of Oughtrington, in this\r\ncounty, descended from John second son of Richard Leigh, of West\r\nHall, who died in 1486; for whom see Ormerod, i. 439.\r\n\r\nLeigh of Leatherlake House in Surrey, descended from Thomas second\r\nson of the Rev. Peter Leigh of West Hall, who died in 1719; and\r\nLeigh of South Carolina, Baronet 1773, descended from Peter third\r\nson of the same Rev. Peter Leigh. See Ormerod, i. 350.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Allowed 1563. Or, a lion rampant gules, armed and langued\r\nazure_. For four descents after the match with Agnes de Legh, her\r\ndescendants used the coat of Lymme, _Gules, a pale fusillé argent_,\r\nconclusive evidence of the descent of this family from Richard de\r\nLymme, and not from William de Venables, another husband of Agnes de\r\nLegh. Indeed, in the Visitation of 1566, this coat of Lymme was\r\nallowed to Leigh of West Hall; but in 1584 both the East and West\r\nHall families claimed the lion rampant gules. In 1663 the arms were\r\nsettled as at present.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Egerton Leigh, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALDERSEY OF ALDERSEY, IN THE PARISH OF CODDINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] The pedigree is traced to Hugh de Aldersey, in the\r\nreign of Henry III., soon after which time the family divided into\r\ntwo branches; the estate and manor of Aldersey being also held in\r\nseparate moieties by the representatives of the two families: one\r\nmoiety eventually passed by an heir-general to Hatton of Hatton, and\r\nhas since been united into one estate, by purchase from Dutton of\r\nHatton. A younger branch of this family was seated at Chester, of\r\nwhich was William Aldersey the antiquary, mayor of that city in\r\n1614.\r\n\r\nSee Ormerod, ii. 404.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Gules, on a bend engrailed argent, between two cinquefoils\r\nor, three leopard's faces vert_. The more ancient coat, given in\r\nKing's Vale Royal, appears to have been, _Sable, three chargers or\r\ndishes argent_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Thomas Aldersey, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBASKERVYLE, (CALLED GLEGG,) OF OLD WITHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] Ormerod traces this family to Sir John Baskervyle,\r\ngrantee of a moiety of Old Withington from Robert de Camvyle in\r\n1266, and that estate has ever since remained in the family. In 1758\r\nJohn Baskervyle, Esq., the representative of the house of Old\r\nWithington, having married the heiress of Glegg of Gayton, in this\r\ncounty, assumed that name in lieu of his own.\r\n\r\nSee Ormerod, iii. 355; and for Glegg, ib. ii. 285.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Argent, a chevron gules between three hurts_. This coat,\r\n_the chevron charged with three fleurs-de-lis or_, was borne by\r\n\"Monsire de Baskervile;\" see Sir Harris Nicolas's Roll of Arms temp.\r\nE. III.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, John Baskervyle Glegg, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBROOKE OF NORTON, BARONET 1662.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] Adam Lord of Leighton, in the reign of Henry III., is\r\nthe first recorded ancestor of this family, who continued at\r\nLeighton, the seat of the principal branch of the Brookes, until the\r\nextinction of the elder male line, in or about the year 1632.\r\nRichard Brooke, younger son of Thomas Brooke of Leighton, purchased\r\nNorton from King Henry VIII. in the year 1545, which has remained\r\nthe residence of his heirs male.\r\n\r\nYounger branches: Broke of Nacton in the county of Suffolk, Baronet\r\n1813; descended from Sir Richard Brooke, Knight, Chief Baron of the\r\nExchequer, in the reign of Henry VIII., youngest son of Thomas\r\nBrooke of Leighton, the ancestor of the Norton family. There was a\r\nformer baronetcy in this family, created 1661, extinct 1693. Brooke\r\nof Mere in this county, sprung from Sir Peter Brooke, third son of\r\nThomas Brooke of Norton, established at Mere by purchase in 1632.\r\n\r\nSee Ormerod, i. 360, 500; and iii. 241; Collectanea Topographica et\r\nGenealogica, i. 22; and Wotton's Baronetage, iii. 392.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Or, a cross engrailed party per pale gules and sable_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Sir Richard Brooke, 7th Baronet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n+Gentle.+\r\n\r\n\r\nCLUTTON OF CHORLTON, IN THE PARISH OF MALPAS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] Ormerod gives no detailed pedigree, but states that\r\nthe Cluttons had been settled at Clutton, in the parish of Farndon,\r\nin this county, as early as the 21st of Edward I, and that the manor\r\nof the same place was held by this family in the time of Henry VI.\r\nIn the reign of Henry VIII., Roger, third son of Owen Clutton of\r\nCourthyn, having married an heiress of Aldersey of Chorlton, became\r\nseated there, and was the ancestor of the present family. From\r\nHenry, elder brother of this Roger, were descended the Clutton\r\nBrocks late of Pensax in Worcestershire, who were there established\r\nin the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nSee Ormerod, ii. 366, 410, and a pedigree of this family in Harleian\r\nMS. 2119.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Argent, a chevron ermine, cotised sable, between three\r\nannulets gules_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Thomas Charlton Clutton, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECHE OF CARDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] The pedigree commences in the reign of Henry IV. with\r\nJohn Leche, (said to be a younger brother of the house of Leche of\r\nChatsworth, in Derbyshire,) who married the heiress of Cawarthyn, or\r\nCarden, and settled there about the year 1475. Some pedigrees,\r\nhowever, seat the Leches at Carden as early as the twentieth of\r\nEdward III.; and there is also a tradition that the family is\r\ndescended from the leche, or chirurgeon, of that monarch himself. It\r\nis remarkable that Nolan has been the family christian name, with\r\none exception, during thirteen generations.\r\n\r\nYounger branch, extinct in 1694, Leche of Mollington, in this\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\nSee Harl. MS. 2119, 50, quoted by Ormerod, ii. 385.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Ermine, on a chief indented gules three crowns or_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, John Hurleston Leche, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBARNSTON OF CHURTON, IN THE PARISH OF FARNDON.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] The descent of this family is not proved beyond\r\nRobert Barnston, of Churton, in the third year of Richard II. But\r\nHugh de Barnston was lord of a moiety of Barnston in the\r\ntwenty-first of Edward I. The pedigree was confirmed in the\r\nVisitations of 1613 and 1663-4.\r\n\r\nSee Ormerod, ii. 408.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Azure, a fess indented ermine between six cross-crosslets\r\nfitchée or_. Thomas de Bernaston bore this coat, except that the\r\ncrosses were argent. See the Roll of Arms of the Reign of Edward\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Roger Barnston, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANTROBUS OF ANTROBUS, BARONET 1815.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] This is an instance of an ancient family, which,\r\nhaving gone down in the world, has recovered itself by means of\r\ncommercial pursuits, after centuries of comparative obscurity.\r\nAntrobus was sold by Henry Antrobus in the reign of Henry IV., and\r\nrepurchased by Edmund Antrobus in 1808; he having proved himself a\r\ndescendant of Henry, youngest son of Henry Antrobus above mentioned.\r\nAntrobus of Eaton Hall, in this county, is again a younger branch of\r\nthis family.\r\n\r\nSee Ormerod, i. 487; Lysons's Cheshire, p. 532; Debrett's\r\nBaronetage, ed. 1836, p. 383.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Lozengy or and azure, on a pale gules three estoiles of the\r\nfirst_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Sir Edmund William Romer Antrobus, 2nd\r\nBaronet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAWTON OF LAWTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] It is not improbable that this family is descended\r\nfrom Robert, a younger son of Vivian de Davenport, who settled at\r\nLawton in the 50th of Henry III. and assumed the local name: this\r\nassertion is borne out by the arms, which are evidently founded on\r\nthose of Davenport. The pedigree is not however traced beyond Hugh\r\nLawton, who married Isabella, daughter of John Madoc, in the reign\r\nof Henry VI. The manor of Lawton was purchased by William Lawton,\r\nEsq. from King Henry VIII. It had been formerly held by the\r\nAbbey of Chester, to which the Lawtons appear to have been tenants\r\nfrom a very early period. Younger branch, Lawton of Lake Marsh, in\r\nthe county of Cork.\r\n\r\nSee Ormerod, iii. 11, and Lysons's Cheshire, p. 673.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Argent, on a fess between three cross-crosslets fitchée\r\nsable a cinquefoil of the first_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, John Lawton, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOTTON OF COMBERMERE, VISCOUNT COMBERMERE 1826, BARONET 1677.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] There are several places called Cotton, and\r\nantiquaries have doubted from which of them the present family is\r\ncalled. The house usually assigned is that of Cotton, near Wem, in\r\nShropshire, where Sir Hugh Cotton was seated in the reign of Edward\r\nI., and whose descendant, Roger Cotton, acquired the estate of\r\nAlkington, in the same county, by marriage of the heiress, in the\r\nreign of Richard II.

Arrow, in the county of Warwick, which\r\ncame from the heiress of Camvile the 9th of Edward II., was long the\r\nseat of the Burdetts, but they had long before, as Dugdale shows,\r\nbeen connected by property with that county, William Burdett having\r\nfounded the cell of Ancote, near Sekindon, in the fifth of Henry II.\r\nThe manor of Arrow, and many other estates of this family, carried\r\nby an heiress to the Conways in the reign of Henry VII., became the\r\nfruitful cause of many lawsuits, which were not finally settled till\r\nthe end of the reign of Henry VIII.

Three knights of the house distinguished themselves in\r\nthe wars of the Holy Land. William de Fulford, who held Fulford in\r\nthe reign of Richard I., is the first ascertained ancestor.

It was certainly of the\r\nlatter place in the reign of Edward I.\r\n\r\nCockington in this county was, previous to the Civil Wars of the\r\nseventeenth century, the principal seat of the family.

The Carews are descended from\r\nGerald, son of Walter de Windsor, who lived in the reign of Henry\r\nI., which Walter was son of Otho, in the time of William the\r\nConqueror. Haccombe was inherited from an heiress of Courtenay, and\r\nwas settled on this the second branch of the family in the fifteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe extinct families of Carew of Bickleigh and Carew Earl of Totnes\r\nwere descended from Sir Thomas Carew, elder brother of Nicholas, the\r\nfirst of the Haccombe line.

About the beginning of the eighteenth century\r\nKitley, the present seat, was inherited from the heiress of\r\nPollexfen.\r\n\r\nIn 1779, William Bastard, Esq., the representative of this family,\r\nwas gazetted a Baronet: the honour, which was declined by Mr.\r\nBastard, was intended as an acknowledgment of his services in\r\nraising men to defend Plymouth in 1779.\r\n\r\nSee Lysons, cxxxi, and 577.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Or, a chevron azure_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Baldwin John Pollexfen Bastard, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACLAND OF ACLAND, BARONET 1644.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] Acland, which gave name to this ancient family, is\r\nnow a farm in the parish of Landkey; it is thus described in\r\nWestcote's Devonshire, (p. 290:) \"Then Landkey, or Londkey; and\r\ntherein Acland, or rather Aukeland, as taking name from a grove of\r\noaks, for by such an one the house is seated, and hath given name\r\nand long habitation to the _clarous_ family of the Aclands, which\r\nhave many ages here flourished in a worshipful degree.\" Hugh de\r\nAccalen is the first recorded ancestor; he was living in 1155; from\r\nwhom the present Sir Thomas Dyke Acland is twenty-second in lineal\r\ndescent.

In the female line the Lumleys represent the\r\nBarons Thweng of Kilton, and from hence the arms borne by this\r\nancient house, who were themselves summoned as Barons from the 8th\r\nof Richard II. to the 1st of Henry IV. The elder line of the family\r\nbecame extinct on the death of John Lord Lumley in 1609. It was\r\nduring the time of this Lord that the following anecdote is told.\r\n\"Oh, mon, gang na farther; let me digest the knowledge I ha' gained,\r\nfor I did na ken Adam's name was Lumley,\"--exclaimed King James I.\r\nwhen wearied with Bishop James's prolix account of the Lumley\r\nPedigree, on his Majesty's first visit to Lumley Castle in 1603.

Some of the name, which we may supposed to be\r\nderived from this wood or forest, were seated at Norton before the\r\nyear 1140.

Indeed, although the ancient descent of the\r\nTerells or Tyrells is generally admitted, the pedigree appears to\r\nrequire the attention of an experienced genealogist. There have been\r\nmany branches of the Tyrells in this and other counties; the present\r\nis a junior one of the original stock, and Boreham a very recent\r\npossession.\r\n\r\nElder branches now extinct:--\r\n\r\n  Tyrell of Thornton, co.

This great family are descended from\r\nHardinge, who fought with William at the battle of Hastings; and\r\nwhose son, Robert Fitzhardinge, received the lordship and castle of\r\nBerkeley from Henry II., in reward for his fidelity to the Empress\r\nMaude and her son.

The manor of\r\nKingscote, which had been given by William I. to Roger de Berkeley,\r\nwas inherited from Aldeva, the daughter of Robert Fitz-Hardinge and\r\nthe wife of Nigel de Kingscote, soon after the reign of Henry II.\r\n\r\nThe Kingscotes shared in the glories of both Poictiers and\r\nAgincourt, and, although a family of such long standing in\r\nthis county, appear never to have exceeded the moderate limits of\r\ntheir present ancestral property.\r\n\r\nSee Atkyns's Gloucestershire, 2nd edit. 1768, p. 258; Rudder's\r\nGloucestershire, p. 512; and Fosbroke's Smyth's Lives of the\r\nBerkeleys, p. 218.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Argent, nine escallops sable, on a canton gules a mullet\r\npierced or_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Thomas Henry Kingscote, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRYE OF LECKHAMPTON-COURT.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] This family is traced to Rawlin Try, in the reign of\r\nRichard II.

They had a\r\nson who took the name of Legh, and settled at Booths in Cheshire:\r\nfrom hence came the Leighs of Adlington, and from them the\r\nLeighs of Lyme, both in Cheshire, and both now extinct. John Leigh,\r\nEscheator of Cheshire in the 12th of Henry VI., was a younger son of\r\nSir Peter Leigh, of Lyme, and the ancestor of the Leighs of Ridge,\r\nin the same county. Ridge was sold in the fourth of George II., and\r\nthe family (still I believe existing) removed into Kent.\r\n\r\nThe present family are descended from Sir Thomas Leigh, Knight, Lord\r\nMayor of London in 1558, who was also the ancestor of the extinct\r\nhouse of Stoneleigh.

Ormsby, purchased from the\r\nSkipwiths in 1636, and afterwards Gunby Hall, built by Sir William\r\nMassingberd, the 2nd Baronet of this family, in 1699, was their\r\nprincipal residence, till it went by an heiress to a younger branch\r\nof the Langtons, who have assumed the name. Wrangle is a recent\r\npurchase in this county by the present representative of the male\r\nline of the family. The Massingberds early embraced the Reformed\r\nfaith. Thomas Massingberd, the last representative for Calais in\r\n1552, \"fled abroad for his religion\" under Mary. Nevertheless his\r\ndescendant, William Burrell Massingberd of Ormsby, joined Prince\r\nCharles Edward at Derby: a miniature given to him by the Prince is\r\nstill in the family. Ormsby belongs at present to a younger branch\r\nof the Mundys of Markeaton in Derbyshire, who have assumed the name\r\nof Massingberd.\r\n\r\nSee the Genealogy of this House, a MS. by Robert Dale, Suffolk\r\nHerald, compiled about the year 1718, and still at Ormsby; and\r\nAllen's History of the County, under Ormsby and Gunby.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Azure, three quatrefoils (two and one,) and in chief a boar\r\npassant or, charged on the shoulder with a cross patée gules_, with\r\nwhich the following coat is generally quartered, said to be the arms\r\nassumed by Sir Thomas Massingberd, Knight of St. John, in the reign\r\nof Henry VIII. _Quarterly or and argent, on a cross humetté gules,\r\nbetween four lions rampant sable, two escallops of the first_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, The Rev.

His\r\ngreat-grandson Henry, also of Wrawby, was grandfather of Sir Edmund\r\nAnderson of Flixborough, Knight, Lord Chief Justice of the Common\r\nPleas, who died in 1605. He was the ancestor of the present family,\r\nand of Sir Charles Anderson of Broughton in Lincolnshire, Baronet\r\n1660, and of the Andersons of Eyworth in Bedfordshire, Baronets\r\n1664, extinct in 1773.

The marriage of Richard Bertie son\r\nof Robert, who died in 1500, with Katherine daughter of William\r\nWilloughby, last Lord Willoughby of Eresby, and widow of Charles\r\nBrandon, Duke of Suffolk, was, as is well known, the origin of the\r\nconsequence of this right loyal family, five generations of whose\r\nhistory have been so agreeably illustrated by Lady Georgiana Bertie.\r\nGrimsthorpe, inherited from the Duchess of Suffolk from her paternal\r\nWilloughby ancestors, became the principal seat of the Berties,\r\nBarons Willoughby of Eresby and Lords Great Chamberlains of England,\r\nadvanced in the person of Robert second Lord Willoughby to the\r\nEarldom of Lindsey by King Charles I. His great-grandson was created\r\nDuke of Ancaster and Kesteven in 1715, which titles became extinct\r\non the decease of the fifth Duke in 1809. The Earldom of Lindsey and\r\nrepresentation of the family thereupon devolved on the father of the\r\npresent Earl, descended from the fifth son of the second Earl of\r\nLindsey by his first wife.\r\n\r\nYounger branch, the Earl of Abingdon 1682, Baron Norreys of Rycote\r\n1572, descended from the second marriage of the second Earl of\r\nLindsey and the heiress of Wray, whose mother was the sole\r\nheir of Francis Norreys, Earl of Berkshire, and Lord Norreys of\r\nRycote.\r\n\r\nSee Lady G.

(p. 191.) The name is\r\nlocal, being derived from Wodehouse in Silfield, in this county; but\r\nas early as the reign of Henry III. the family had property in\r\nKimberley, and in that of Henry IV. the manor was also inherited\r\nfrom the heiress of Fastolff.\r\n\r\nSee Blomefield's Norfolk, ed. 1739, vol. i. p. 751, for long\r\nextracts from the curious old pedigree in verse; Wotton's\r\nBaronetage, i. 164; and Brydges's Collins's Peerage, viii. 562.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Sable, a chevron or, guttée de sang, between three\r\ncinquefoils ermine_.

Reginald de Walpole, in the time of Henry I.\r\nseems to have been lineal ancestor of the house.

Astley Castle, the original\r\nseat, descended by an heiress to the Greys of Ruthin, afterwards\r\nMarquesses of Dorset, and Dukes of Suffolk. Hill-Morton in\r\nWarwickshire was also the seat of this family from the reign of\r\nHenry III.\r\n\r\nThe Astleys formerly of Patishull in Staffordshire were the elder\r\nbranch, sprung from the first marriage of Thomas Lord Astley, who\r\nwas killed in the Barons' Wars at Evesham, (the 49th of Henry III.,)\r\nextinct 1771. The Astleys, now of Everley, in Wiltshire, Baronets\r\n1821, descend from the second son of Walter Astley of Patishull, the\r\nfather of the first Baronet of that line (1662).\r\n\r\nSee Parkins's Blomefield's Norfolk, v. 940; Thomas's Dugdale's\r\nWarwickshire, i. 19, 107; and Wotton's Baronetage, iii. 63; for\r\nAstleys of Patishull, Shaw's Staffordshire, ii. 287; and Wotton's\r\nBaronetage, iii. 368.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Azure, a cinquefoil ermine within a border engrailed or_.\r\nThe Patishull and Everley family omit the border, and it was thus\r\nborne by the head of the house in the reign of Richard II.

Oxburgh, or Oxborough, has been\r\nthe residence of this eminently knightly house from the reign of\r\nEdward IV., when it came by the marriage of Edmund Bedingfeld with\r\nMargaret, daughter of Robert Tudenham, and to whom licence was\r\ngranted to build the walls and towers of Oxburgh in the year 1482.\r\nThe baronetcy was conferred by Charles II. as a mark of his favour\r\nand in consideration of the eminent loyalty and consequent\r\nsufferings of the family during the usurpation. The Bedingfelds of\r\nDitchingham, in this county, are a younger branch parted from the\r\nparent stem as early as the middle of the fourteenth century.\r\n\r\nSee Blomefield, iii. 482; Wotton's Baronetage, iii. 212; and the\r\nRev.

Norfolk appears to be the county where\r\nthis great family should be noticed, the Duke of Norfolk still\r\npossessing property in the county of his dukedom derived from his\r\nancestors of the house of Bigod. In the fourteenth century, by the\r\nmatch with the heiress of Mowbray, the foundation of the honors and\r\nconsequence of the Howards was laid, the first Duke being the son of\r\nMargaret, daughter and coheir of Thomas de Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk.\r\nThe Sussex estates came from the heiress of Fitzalan, Earl of\r\nArundel, in the reign of Edward VI.; Worksop from the Talbots;\r\nGreystoke and Morpeth from the Dacres.\r\n\r\nAll the English Peers of the house of Howard are traced to a common\r\nancestor in Thomas, the second Duke of Norfolk, who died in 1524.\r\nThe Duke of Norfolk, the Earls of Suffolk and Carlisle, descend from\r\nhis first wife, and the Earl of Effingham from the second. The\r\nHowards of Greystoke, in Cumberland, are a younger branch of the\r\npresent ducal house. The Howards of Corby Castle, in the same\r\ncounty, descend from the second son of \"Belted Will,\" the ancestor\r\nof the house of Carlisle.\r\n\r\nExtinct branches.

The\r\npresent coat was borne by Sir John Howard in the reign of Edward\r\nII., and by Mr. Howard in those of Edward II. and Richard III.: it\r\nhas been conjectured, from the similarity of this coat with that of\r\nthe Botilers, Barons of Wem, (Gules, a fess cheeky argent and sable\r\nbetween six crosses pateé fitchée argent,) that Sir William Howard\r\nthe Judge was descended from the Hords, stewards to these Barons: it\r\nis observable that none of the Howards ever prefixed the _de_ to\r\ntheir name, a fact which opposes their derivation from Hawarden in\r\nFlintshire.

Previous to that time the Gurneys appear to have been\r\nseated at Harpley, also in Norfolk, as early as 1206, and are traced\r\nfor two descents beyond that period, being (as there appears no\r\nreason to doubt) descended from the great Norman baronial house of\r\nthe name. The present family may be said to have been refounded by\r\nJohn Gurney, an eminent silk-merchant at Norwich, about 1670.\r\nKeswick was purchased in 1747. The Gournays of Somersetshire,\r\nrepresented by the Earls of Egmont, may have been a distinct family;\r\ntheir arms were, Paly of six or and azure.

In 1398, John Townshend settled at Rainham,\r\nwhich according to some accounts accrued to them by the heiress of\r\nHavile, but the pedigree as given by Collins cannot be relied on,\r\nneither can the defamatory account of Leland, who says--\"the\r\ngrandfather of Townsende now living was a meane man of substance.\"\r\nThe truth seems to be that the family is old, but not of great\r\naccount before the time of Sir Walter de Townsend, who married Maud\r\nScogan, and flourished about the year 1400.\r\n\r\nSee Blomefield, iii. 815; Brydges's Collins, ii. 454; and Leland's\r\nItinerary, iv. p. 13.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Azure, a chevron ermine between three escallops argent_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, John Villiers Stuart Townshend, 5th Marquess\r\nTownshend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTHAMPTONSHIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Knightly.+\r\n\r\n\r\nWAKE OF COURTEENHALL, BARONET 1621.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] This is a younger branch of the very ancient baronial\r\nhouse of Wake, who were Lincolnshire Barons in the reign of Henry I.\r\nSir Hugh Wake was lord of Deeping in the county of Lincoln, and of\r\nBlisworth in this county, by gift of his father, Baldwin fourth Lord\r\nWake. He died in 1315, and was the direct ancestor of the present\r\nBaronet. See memoir of the family of Wake privately printed in 1833,\r\nbut written by Archbishop Wake; and Wotton's Baronetage, i. 465.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Or, two bars gules, in chief three torteauxes_. This coat\r\nwas borne by Hugh Wake in the reign of Henry III., and again by Sir\r\nJohn Wake in that of Edward II. Sir Hugh Wake at the latter period\r\ndifferenced his arms by a canton azure. His uncle reversed the\r\ncolours gules and argent, the field being gules. M. Thomas Wake de\r\nBlisworth in the reign of Edward III. bore the same arms, with a\r\nborder engrailed sable.

That estate went out of the family by an heiress who\r\nmarried Robert de Peshall, about the reign of Edward III., and the\r\nKnightleys removed to Gnowsall, in the same county, in the 17th of\r\nRichard II. (1394). Fawsley was purchased in the 3rd of Henry V.\r\n(1415-16). It is thus mentioned by Leland: \"Mr. Knightley, a man of\r\ngreat lands, hath his principal house at Foullesle, but it is no\r\nvery sumptuous thing.\" (Itin. i. fol. 11.)\r\n\r\nSee Baker's Northamptonshire, i. 381. Blakeway (Sheriffs of Salop,\r\np. 103) asserts that \"_the Knightleys appear to have been a branch\r\nof the Shirleys_,\" an assumption without any foundation except the\r\nsimilarity of their arms.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Quarterly ermine, and paly of six or and gules_. This coat\r\nwas borne as early as 1301-2 (30th Ed. I.) by Sir Robert de\r\nKnyteley: it is also borne by Cotes of Cotes, co. Stafford, probably\r\nfrom family connection.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Sir Rainald Knightley, 3rd Baronet, M. P.\r\nfor South Northamptonshire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPENCER OF ALTHORPE, EARL SPENCER 1765.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] The Spencers claim a collateral descent from the\r\nancient baronial house of Le Despenser, a claim which, without being\r\nirreconcileable perhaps with the early pedigrees of that family,\r\nadmits of very grave doubts and considerable difficulties. It seems\r\nto be admitted that they descend from Henry Spencer, who, having\r\nbeen educated in the Abbey of Evesham, obtained from the abbot in\r\nthe reign of Henry VI. a lease of the domains and tithes of Badby in\r\nthis county, and was induced to settle there. His son removed to\r\nHodnell in Warwickshire, his grandson to Rodburn in the same county,\r\nhis great-grandson Sir John purchased Althorpe in 1508. The Spencers\r\nof Claverdon, co. Warwick (extinct 1685), were a younger branch. The\r\nDukes of Marlborough (1702) represent the elder line of this family.\r\n\r\nSee Baker's Northamptonshire, i. 106; and Brydges's Collins, i. 378.\r\n\r\nThe poet Spenser boasted that he belonged to this house; though,\r\nsays Baker, \"the precise link of genealogical connexion cannot now\r\nperhaps be ascertained.\"\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Quarterly, first and fourth argent, second and third gules,\r\na fret or, over all a bend sable charged with three escallops of the\r\nfirst_. This coat, which is differenced from the ancient baronial\r\narms by the three escallop shells, was used by Henry Spencer of\r\nBadby, who sealed his will with it. In 1504 another coat was\r\ngranted, viz. _Azure, a fess ermine between six sea-mew's heads\r\nerased argent_, but the more ancient arms have been generally borne\r\nby the Spencers.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, John Poyntz Spencer, 5th Earl Spencer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROKEBY OF ARTHINGWORTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] This is a junior branch of the Rokebys of Rokeby in\r\nYorkshire, a knightly race immortalized by Scott. The principal line\r\nhas been long extinct. Sir Thomas Rokeby was Sheriff of Yorkshire in\r\nthe eighth of Henry IV. The family was seated in the parish of\r\nEcclesfield, and also at Sandal-Parva, in South Yorkshire, where\r\nWilliam Rokeby was Rector in the reign of Henry VII. In 1512 he\r\nbecame Archbishop of Dublin. His brother Ralph wrote the history of\r\nthe family, now in possession of Mr. Rokeby of Arthingworth, and\r\nwhich is printed in Whitaker's Richmondshire, vol. i. p. 158. The\r\npresent family acquired Arthingworth from the Langhams by marriage\r\nin the end of the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nSee Hunter's South Yorkshire, i. p. 199.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Argent, a chevron between three rooks sable_, borne by Mons.\r\nThomas de Rokeby in the reigns of Edward III. and Richard II.

(1167).\r\nThickthornes in Chicheley in that county appears to have been the\r\nresidence of the Maunsells, and also Turvey in Bedfordshire. These\r\nlands were sold by William the son of Sampson le Maunsel of Turvey\r\nto William Mordaunt in 1287. The Maunsells afterwards settled at\r\nBury-End in Chicheley, and in 1622 at Thorpe-Malsor.\r\n\r\nElder Branches. 1. Maunsell of Muddlescombe, co. Carmarthen, Baronet\r\n1621-2. 2.

Robert Isham, who died in 1424, is\r\nhowever the first ancestor from whom the pedigree can with certainty\r\nbe deduced. He was Escheator of the county of Northampton, and was\r\nof Picheley (a lordship contiguous to Isham) in the first of Henry\r\nV. Lamport was purchased by John Isham, the immediate ancestor of\r\nthe present family, fourth son of Sir Euseby Isham, of Picheley,\r\nKnight, in the year 1559. He was an eminent merchant of London.\r\n\r\nSee Wotton's Baronetage, ii. 28.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Gules, a fess and in chief three piles wavy argent_.

The celebrated Sir Geoffry Palmer, Attorney-General to\r\nCharles II. was the first Baronet.\r\n\r\nSee Wotton's Baronetage, iii. 19; and Nichols's Leicestershire, vol.\r\nii. pt. ii. p. 543.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Sable, a chevron or between three crescents argent_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Sir Geoffrey Palmer, 8th Baronet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFANE OF APTHORP, EARL OF WESTMORELAND 1642.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] The Fanes or Vanes are said to have originated from\r\nWales; in the reign of Henry VI. they were seated at Hilden in\r\nTunbridge, in Kent, by a marriage with the Peshalls. In 1574 Sir\r\nThomas Fane married Mary daughter and heir of Henry Neville, Lord\r\nAbergavenny; hence the importance of the family, and the Earldom of\r\nWestmoreland, the ancient honour of the house of Neville. Apthorp\r\ncame from the heiress of Mildmay, about the end of the reign of\r\nQueen Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nYounger Branches. Fane of Wormesley, Oxfordshire, descended from\r\nHenry Fane, Esq., younger brother of Thomas eighth Earl of\r\nWestmoreland. The Duke of Cleveland (1833) and Sir Henry Vane, of\r\nHutton Hall in Cumberland, Baronet (1786), descend from John younger\r\nbrother of Richard Fane, ancestor of the Earl of Westmoreland.\r\n\r\nSee Brydges's Collins, iii. 283, and iv. 499; Hasted's Kent, ii.\r\n265; and Blore's Rutlandshire, p. 103.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Azure, three right-hand gauntlets or_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Francis William Henry Fane, 12th Earl of\r\nWestmoreland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTHUMBERLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Knightly.+\r\n\r\n\r\nCLAVERING OF CALLALY CASTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] Robert Fitz-Roger, Baron of Warkworth, the ancestor\r\nof this great Norman family, was father of John, who assumed the\r\nname of \"Clavering,\" from a lordship in Essex, as it is said, by the\r\nappointment of King Edward I. From Sir Alan, younger brother of\r\nJohn, the present family is descended. Callaly was granted to Robert\r\nFitz-Roger by Gilbert de Callaly in the reign of Henry III., and has\r\never since continued in the possession of the house of Clavering.\r\n\r\nYounger Branches. Clavering of Axwell, co. Durham, Baronet 1661,\r\ndescended from James, third son of Robert Clavering of Callaly.\r\nClavering of Berrington in North Durham, descended from William,\r\nthird son of Sir John Clavering, who died a prisoner in London for\r\nhis loyalty to King Charles I. Extinct about 1812.\r\n\r\nSee Nicolas's Siege of Carlaverock, pp. 115, 117; Mackenzie's View\r\nof Northumberland, vol. ii. p. 27; Surtees's Durham, ii. 248;\r\nWotton's Baronetage, iii. 295; and Raine's North Durham, p. 213.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Quarterly or and gules, a bend sable_, and so borne by\r\nRobert Fitz-Roger, as appears by the Roll of Carlaverock, and by his\r\nson John de Clavering, who differenced his coat by a label vert. Sir\r\nAlexander de Clavering, in the reign of Edward II., charged the bend\r\nwith three mullets argent. John Clavering, in the reign of Richard\r\nII., the same arms, with a label of three points argent. (Rolls of\r\nthe dates.)\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Edward John Clavering, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMITFORD OF MITFORD CASTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] Descended from Mathew, brother of John, who is said\r\nto have held the Castle of Mitford soon after the Conquest, and by\r\nwhose only daughter and heiress it went to the Bertrams. The\r\nancestors of the present family appear to have been for many ages\r\nresident at Mitford, though the castle was not in their possession\r\ntill it was granted with the manor by Charles II. to Robert Mitford,\r\nEsq.\r\n\r\nYounger Branches. Mitford of Pitshill, co. Sussex, descended from\r\nthe fourth son of Robert Mitford of Mitford Castle, Esq., Sheriff of\r\nYorkshire in 1702. Mitford of Exbury, co. Southampton, sprung from\r\nthe third son of Robert Mitford, of Mitford Castle, Esq., who died\r\nin 1674. From this latter branch Mitford Baron Redesdale (1803) of\r\nBatsford, co. Gloucester, is derived.\r\n\r\nSee Hodgson's History of Northumberland, vol. ii. pt. ii. p. 44 and\r\nfor Mitford of Exbury the same work, vol. i. pt. ii. p. 152; see\r\nalso Brydges's Collins, ix. 182.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Argent, a fess sable between three moles proper_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Robert Mitford, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSWINBURNE OF CAPHEATON, BARONET 1660.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] Swinburne in this county gave name to this ancient\r\nfamily, the first recorded ancestor being John, father of Sir\r\nWilliam de Swinburne, living in 1278, and Alan Swinburne, Rector of\r\nWhitfield, who purchased Capheaton from Sir Thomas Fenwick, Knt., in\r\n1274.\r\n\r\nChollerton in Northumberland was also an ancient seat of the\r\nSwinburnes; it was held under the great Umfrevile family by this\r\nsame Sir William de Swinburne, the arms being evidently founded upon\r\nthe coat of the Umfreviles. The date of the baronetcy points to the\r\nloyalty of the family during the civil wars of the seventeenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nSee the early part of the pedigree in Surtees's Durham, ii. 872;\r\nHodgson's History of Northumberland, vol. i. pt. ii. p. 231; and\r\nWotton's Baronetage, iii. 167.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Per fess gules and argent, three cinquefoils\r\ncounterchanged_, borne by Monsieur William Swynburne in the reign of\r\nRichard II.

The castle of Belsey\r\nappears to have come from the heiress of Stryvelin in the reign of\r\nEdward III. The name was exchanged for Monck in 1799.

Their early history\r\nunfortunately is defective, occasioned by an accidental fire which\r\ntook place at Allenton in 1721, at that time the residence of the\r\nfamily, whose evidences were thereby mostly destroyed.\r\n\r\nFor the grant above mentioned, and for the pedigree, see Mackenzie's\r\nView of Northumberland, ii. 39.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Barry of eight or and sable_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Walter Selby, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREY OF HOWICK, EARL GREY 1806, BARONET 1746.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] An eminent border family, of which there have been\r\nmany branches, descended from Thomas Grey of Heton, living in the\r\nsecond of Edward I.

It has been supposed that this family is\r\nof Scotch extraction; but a fire which took place at Haggerston\r\nCastle, the ancestral seat of this house, in the year 1618, and\r\nanother which happened in 1687, having destroyed the ancient\r\nevidences, the early history is somewhat imperfect.\r\n\r\nSee Mackenzie's Northumberland, i. p. 328, note; Raine's North\r\nDurham, p. 224; and Wotton's Baronetage, ii. 388.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Azure, on a bend cotised argent three billets sable_. The\r\nancient arms of this venerable family, of which Raine writes, \"few\r\nfamilies can boast of such a pedigree or of such a shield of arms,\"\r\nwas a scaling ladder between two leaves, alluding to the coat of\r\nHazlerigg, an heiress of that house having married into the\r\nHaggerston family. The arms were so borne in 1577, as appears by a\r\nseal of that date: the scaling ladder was afterwards corrupted into\r\nthe bendlets and billets.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Sir John Haggerston, 9th Baronet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRIDLEY OF BLAGDON, BARONET 1756.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] The pedigree is proved for three descents before the\r\nreign of Henry VIII., the original seat of the family being at\r\nWillimoteswick in this county, of which place Nicholas de Rydle is\r\ndesignated Esquire in 1481; here also was born the Martyr Bishop of\r\nLondon, Nicholas Ridley, early in the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe present family is a younger branch, seated at Blagdon and\r\ninheriting the baronetcy on the death of Sir Mathew White in 1763.\r\n\r\nSee Hodgson's History of Northumberland, vol. ii. pt. ii. p. 322,\r\nand vol. iii. pt. ii. p. 340.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Gules, a chevron between three goshawks argent_.

From this match came the manor of Averham or\r\nEgram in this county, which long continued the seat and residence of\r\nthe Suttons, who were represented in the days of Queen Elizabeth by\r\nSir William Sutton, whom her Majesty coupled, not in the most\r\ncomplimentary manner, with three other eminent Nottinghamshire\r\nknights in the following distich:--\r\n\r\n  \"Gervase the gentle,* Stanhope the stout,\r\n   Markham the lion, and _Sutton the lout_.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1646, Robert Sutton, the head of this family, was raised to the\r\nPeerage as Baron Lexington, extinct 1723, who is represented in the\r\nfemale line by Viscount Canterbury.

In the reign of Edward III. we\r\nfind Sir Richard Stanhope, grandson of Walter, Mayor of\r\nNewcastle-on-Tyne. Hampton and other manors in this county came by\r\nmarriage with the heiress of Maulovel about 1370; but on the death\r\nof Richard Stanhope in 1529, these estates went to his only daughter\r\nand heiress, who became the wife of John Babington. The monastery of\r\nShelford was soon after this period granted to Sir Michael Stanhope\r\n(in the 31st of Henry VIII).\r\n\r\nYounger Branches. 1. Stanhope of Holme-Lacy, Baronet 1807, descended\r\nfrom the youngest brother of the great-grandfather of the present\r\nEarl. 2.

He was enriched by large grants of land from the crown, and\r\nbuilt the castle of Kenilworth. The present family descend from the\r\nbrother of this Geffery, whose issue were of Coleshill and Maxtoke\r\nin Warwickshire, of which latter place John de Clinton was created\r\nBaron in 1298. His descendant, Edward Lord Clinton, was advanced to\r\nthe Earldom of Lincoln in 1572. No family was more nobly allied, few\r\nhad broader possessions--all have been long dissipated; but a\r\nfortunate match with the eventual heiress of Pelham in 1717 revived\r\nthe drooping fortunes of the Clintons; hence the estate of Clumber,\r\nthe former seat of the Holles family, and the Dukedom of Newcastle.\r\n\r\nSee Dugdale's Warwickshire, 2nd ed. vol. ii. pp. 992, 1007; and\r\nBrydges's Collins, ii. 181.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Argent, three cross crosslets fitchée sable, on a chief\r\nazure two mullets pierced of the first_. The original arms, as borne\r\nby Thomas de Clinton in the reign of Henry III., appears to have\r\nbeen _a plain chief_. See his seal engraved in Upton, de Studio\r\nMilitari, p. 82. In the reign of Edward II. Sir John Clinton of\r\nMaxtoke bore, _Argent, on a chief azure two mullets or_. At the same\r\nperiod another Sir John Clinton bore, _Or, three piles azure, a\r\ncanton ermine_. His son in the fifth of Edward III. bore, _Argent,\r\non a chief azure two fleurs-de-lis or_. William Clinton, Earl of\r\nHuntingdon, at the same period bore the present coat with the\r\nexception of _three mullets or_ in place of the _two mullets\r\nargent_, and John Clinton omitted the crosslets. William Clinton,\r\nLord of Allesley, who lived at the same period, bore the present\r\ncoat.

The first of the name known is William le Eyre, of Hope, in\r\nthe reign of Henry III. In the reign of Henry V. the family divided\r\ninto three great branches: the present house descends from Eyre of\r\nLaughton in South Yorkshire, who spring from Eyre of Home Hall near\r\nChesterfield.

In\r\nthe reigns of Edward II. and III., Sir John Stonor, Chief Justice of\r\nthe Common Pleas, (whose tomb is preserved in the chancel of\r\nDorchester church in this county,) was the representative and great\r\nadvancer of the family.\r\n\r\nSee Magna Britannia, iv. 425; and the first edition of Burke's\r\nCommoners, ii. 440; see also Excerpta Historica, p. 353, for some\r\ncurious letters of the Stonors of the time of Edward IV.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Azure, two bars dancetté or, a chief argent_.

H. Wykeham, Esq., who died in 1800, and still, I\r\nbelieve, belonging to his daughter the Baroness Wenman. Tythrop came\r\nfrom the Herberts by will to the late P. P.

Belton in Rutlandshire was afterwards inherited\r\nby his descendants from the Odinsels, and Hampton-Lovet, in the\r\ncounty of Worcester, from the Lovet family. In 1404, Nicholas le\r\nBlount, who had been deeply engaged in the conspiracy to restore\r\nRichard II. to his throne, changed his name to Croke, on his return\r\nto England, in order to avoid the revenge of Henry IV. The Crokes\r\nafterwards became a legal family, and seated themselves at Chilton\r\nin Buckinghamshire. The priory of Studley was purchased from Henry\r\nVIII. by John Croke, in 1539.\r\n\r\nYounger Branches. Blount of Sodington, in the county of Worcester,\r\nand of Mawley Hall in Shropshire, descended from William, second son\r\nof Sir Robert le Blount, who died in 1288, and the heiress of\r\nOdinsels. The Blounts of Maple-Durham in this county, and the\r\nextinct Lords Mountjoy, are of a still junior line to the house\r\nof Sodington. The other extinct branches are too numerous to\r\nmention.\r\n\r\nSee Croke's Genealogy of the Croke Family, 4to. 1823, and \"The\r\nScrope and Grosvenor Roll,\" vol. ii. p. 192, for a memoir of Sir\r\nWalter Blount, who fell at the battle of Shrewsbury together with\r\nSir Hugh Shirley and two other knights in the royal coat-armour of\r\nHenry the Fourth--\r\n\r\n  \"semblably furnished like the King himself.\"\r\n\r\nARMS.--For Blount. _Barry nebulée of six or and sable_. For Croke,\r\n_Gules, a fess between six martlets argent_. The more ancient coat\r\nwas, _Lozengy or and sable_, which was borne by William le Blount in\r\nthe reign of Henry III. Sir William le Blount of Warwickshire, (so\r\ncalled because he held under the Earl of Warwick,) bore the present\r\n_nebulée_ coat in the reign of Edward II. Sir Thomas le Blount at\r\nthe same period _the fess between three martlets_, now called the\r\ncoat of Croke.

In the\r\nreign of James II. the eldest son of a younger brother was created a\r\nBaronet, of Waterstock in this county. His daughter and eventual\r\nheiress married Sir Richard Allin, Baronet, whose daughter, marrying\r\nMr. Ashurst of Ashurst, great-grandfather of the present\r\nrepresentative of the family, brought the estate of Waterstock into\r\nthe elder line of the Ashursts.\r\n\r\nSee Burke's Extinct and Dormant Baronetage, and his Landed Gentry.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Gules, a cross between four fleurs-de-lis argent_.

(1156,) is assumed to have been son of\r\nRichard, of Annesley, in the county of Nottingham, mentioned in the\r\nDomesday Survey. That estate continued in the Annesleys till the\r\ndeath of John de Annesley, Esq., in 1437, when it went by an heiress\r\nto the Chaworths. The family then removed to Rodington in the same\r\ncounty, and afterwards to Newport-Pagnell in Buckinghamshire; but\r\nIreland was the scene of the prosperity of the family, early in the\r\nseventeenth century, which may be said to have been re-founded by\r\nSir Francis Annesley, Secretary of State in 1616. Hence the\r\nViscountcy of Valentia, which afterwards merged in the Earldom of\r\nAnglesey in England, adjudged by the English House of Lords to be\r\nextinct in 1761; but by the same evidence the Viscountcy of Valentia\r\nwas allowed to the grandson of the last Earl of Anglesey, whom the\r\nEnglish House of Lords found to be illegitimate. He was created Earl\r\nof Mountnorris in Ireland in 1793, and on the decease of the last\r\nEarl in 1844, the Irish Viscountcy and the representation of\r\nthe family descended to Arthur Annesley of Bletchingdon, Esq.,\r\ndescended from the second marriage of the first Viscount Valentia.\r\n\r\nYounger Branches. 1.

The present coat of arms is\r\nsaid to have been assumed in the reign of Edward I., as a badge of\r\nSir Richard de Villers' services in the crusades. \"Villiers of\r\nBrokesby\" occurs among the gentlemen of Leicestershire, \"that be\r\nthere most of reputation,\" in the Itinerary of Leland the antiquary\r\nin the reign of Henry VIII. But the great rise of the family\r\nwas in the reign of James I., when the favourite Sir George Villiers\r\nbecame Duke of Buckingham in 1623, extinct 1687. The Earls of Jersey\r\nare sprung from the second but elder brother of the first duke.\r\nTheir connection with Oxfordshire appears not to have been before\r\nthe middle of the last century. Brokesby was sold by Sir William\r\nVilliers, who died s. p. 1711.\r\n\r\nYounger Branch.

Mapouder in\r\nDorsetshire, derived from the heiress of Veale in the reign of Henry\r\nV., became afterwards the family seat. In 1554, John Coker, who\r\nappears to have been second son of Thomas Coker, of Mapouder,\r\npurchased the Manor of \"Nuns' Place or King's End in Biscester,\"\r\nwhich has since remained the residence of this ancient family.\r\n\r\nSee Coker's Survey of Dorsetshire, p. 98; Hutchins's History of\r\nDorsetshire, vol. iii. p. 273; Kennett's Parochial Antiquities, 1st.\r\ned. p. 109; and Burke's Commoners, 2nd ed. vol. iii. p. 347.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Argent, on a bend gules three leopard's heads or_.

The Parkers were established at Park Hall, in the\r\nparish of Caverswall, in the seventeenth century, having been\r\npreviously seated at Parwich, and before that at Norton-Lees, in the\r\ncounty of Derby.

The elder branch of this family is\r\nrepresented by the Viscount Powerscourt in Ireland, descended from\r\nLewis the ninth son of Sir John Wingfield of Letheringham. The\r\npresent family is sprung from Henry, a younger brother of this Sir\r\nJohn, who died in 1481. Tickencote was acquired by marriage in the\r\nreign of Elizabeth with the heiress of Gresham.\r\n\r\nYounger Branch.

In the twelfth century\r\nthe Corbets divided into two branches; the elder was seated at\r\nWattlesborough, the younger at Caus-Castle. In the time of Henry\r\nIII. the former became of Moreton-Corbet, derived from the heiress\r\nof the Anglo-Saxon family of Toret; but the Caus-Castle line was by\r\nfar the most eminent, and became barons of the realm. In the reign\r\nof Richard II. several of the most ancient of the Corbet estates\r\nwere lost by an heiress; and this happened again in 1583, when the\r\nlands brought into the family by the heiress of Hopton went by\r\nmarriage to the Wallops and Careys. Moreton-Corbet remained till\r\n1688, when it also descended to the sister of Sir Vincent Corbet;\r\nbut the male line was still preserved by the Corbets of Shrewsbury,\r\nand the ancient estate of Moreton-Corbet re-purchased about 1743.\r\n\r\nYounger Branch.

Certain it is that the direct ancestors of the family\r\nof Leighton were resident there at the very commencement of the\r\ntwelfth century. From Rainald the sheriff, who was the superior lord\r\nof Leighton when Domesday was compiled, that and all his other\r\nmanors passed in marriage with his daughter to Alan, the ancestor of\r\nthe Fitz-Alan family; and in the _Liber Niger_, under the year 1167,\r\nRichard son of Tiel (Tihel) is stated to hold Leighton under William\r\nFitz-Alan by the service of one knight. This Richard was the\r\nundoubted ancestor of this ancient family.

He\r\nmarried Matilda, younger sister and coheir of Ralph le Strange, and\r\nin her right became possessed of the manor of Kinnerley and other\r\nestates in Shropshire. Madoc, the eldest son of Griffith, seated\r\nhimself at Sutton, from him called to this day \"Sutton Madoc;\"\r\nGriffith Vychan, the younger son, had Kinnerley, a portion of his\r\nmother's inheritance, and in that manor he resided at Tre-gynvarth,\r\n_Anglicè_ Kynvarth's Town, usually written and spoken as _Kynaston_;\r\nand hence the name of the family. Griffith or Griffin de Kyneveston,\r\nson of Griffith Vychan, was witness to a grant of land to the abbey\r\nof Haghmond in 1313. His lineal descendant Roger Kynaston fought at\r\nBlore Heathe in 1459, and Lord Audley the Lancastrian General is\r\nsupposed to have fallen by his hand; hence the second quarter in the\r\narms, and for this and other services he received the honour of\r\nknighthood. The Kynastons, from the place so called, went to\r\nHordley, and latterly in the seventeenth century removed to\r\nHardwicke.\r\n\r\nThe Kynastons of Oteley, extinct early in the eighteenth century,\r\nwere an elder branch; they acquired Oteley by the marriage of an\r\nheiress of that ancient house in the reign of Henry VII., and were\r\ndescended from John, elder brother of Sir Roger Kynaston before\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nSee Blakeway, p. 73; and Morris MSS.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Quarterly_, 1 _and_ 4, _Argent, a lion rampant sable_; 2\r\n_and_ 3, _Ermine, a chevron gules_.

The Barony of Burford came\r\ninto the Cornewall family before he ninth of Edward II. with the\r\ncoheiress of Mortimer, and continued with the descendants till\r\nthe death of Francis, Baron of Burford, in 1726. The present\r\nfamily is sprung from a younger line, seated at Berrington in the\r\ncounty of Hereford, in the fifteenth century, and which estate was\r\nsold in the eighteenth.

His son and grandson John took the name\r\nof Lingen: the latter is recorded in the Testa de Nevill as holding\r\nvarious estates in Herefordshire, \"of the old feoffment,\" that is,\r\nby descent from the time of King Henry I. His lineal descendant, Sir\r\nJohn Lingen, of Lingen and Sutton, in the county of Hereford, having\r\nmarried in the reign of Edward IV. the daughter and coheiress\r\nof Sir John Burgh, succeeded to considerable estates in Shropshire,\r\nand to the manor of Radbrook, in the county of Gloucester, until\r\nrecently the inheritance of his descendants. Longnor, the ancient\r\nseat of the Burtons, came into the family in 1722, by the marriage\r\nof Thomas Lingen, Esq. of Radbrook, with Anne, only daughter of\r\nRobert Burton, Esq. and sister and heir of Thomas Burton, of\r\nLongnor, Esq.

The\r\nShropshire estates went to the elder son, and passed through\r\nheiresses first to the Peshalls, and thence to the Lacons. Fifth\r\nin descent from Sir Bryan de Harley was John Harley, Esq. who\r\nsignalised himself at Flodden Field in 1513. His eldest son was\r\nancestor of the Earls of Oxford (1711,) extinct 1853. The present\r\nfamily, who now represent this ancient lineage, are descended from\r\nWilliam third son of the above mentioned John. He died in 1600,\r\nhaving seated himself at Beckjay, in this county.

He was seated at Kettleby, in that county, which\r\nremained the residence of the elder branch, created Baronets in\r\n1611, until its extinction in 1673. A younger son was of Scotter, in\r\nthe same county, the ancestor of the present family, of whom John,\r\nfifth son of the Rev. Robert Tyrwhitt, married a descendant of the\r\nJones's of Shrewsbury, and by her acquired the Stanley-Hall estate,\r\nand took the name of Jones, but the present Baronet has since\r\nresumed the ancient name of Tyrwhitt.\r\n\r\nSee Blakeway, p. 240; Wotton's Baronetage, i. 178; Camden's Remains,\r\np. 151; Baker's Northamptonshire, i. 115 and \"Notices and Remains of\r\nthe Family of Tyrwhitt,\" &c. \"printed not published.\" 8vo. n.d.

The pedigree, however, is not traced beyond the reign of\r\nHenry III.\r\n\r\nAlthough very ancient, this family does not appear to have been\r\ndistinguished except by \"The fair maid of Gatacre,\" (see Blakeway,\r\np. 169,) and by the eminent divine of this house noticed in\r\n\"Fuller's Worthies,\" and who was the ancestor of the Gatacres of\r\nMildenhall, in Suffolk.\r\n\r\nSee Leland's Itinerary, v. p. 31; Eyton's Antiquities of Shropshire,\r\nvol. iii. p. 86; and Morris MSS.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Quarterly gules and ermine, on the second and third quarters\r\nthree piles of the first, on a fess azure five bezants_.

They were in some way connected with the\r\nPantulfs, Barons of Wem, who were Lords of Eyton at the period of\r\nthe Domesday Survey, and, in consequence of this connection, not\r\nonly quarter their arms, but were among the very few Shropshire\r\ngentry who were not dispossessed after the Rebellion of the third\r\nNorman Earl of Shrewsbury, in the time of Henry I.\r\n\r\nRobert de Eyton stands at the head of the pedigree.\r\n\r\nSee Blakeway, pp. 56, 70, 71; Eyton's Shropshire, viii. p. 26; and\r\nMorris MSS.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Quarterly, first and fourth, or, a fret azure; second and\r\nthird, gules two bars ermine_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Thomas Campbell Eyton, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLOWDEN OF PLOWDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] When the ancestors of this family were first seated\r\nat Plowden is a matter of doubt, but it was at a very early period.\r\nIn 1194 Roger de Plowden is said to have been at the siege of Acre\r\nwith Richard I., and there to have acquired the fleurs-de-lis in the\r\narms.

The Apley\r\nbranch made a large fortune by mercantile transactions in London in\r\nthe reign of Elizabeth, and purchased that estate in 1572, from Sir\r\nThomas Lucy, Knight. The Whitmores have represented Bridgnorth in\r\nParliament constantly since the reign of Charles II. Blakeway\r\nobserves that this family does not appear to have had any connection\r\nwith the Whitmores of Cheshire, though the Heralds have given them\r\nsimilar arms, with a crest allusive to the springing of a young\r\nshoot out of an old stock.\r\n\r\nYounger Branches.

He was the ancestor of the present family. Sixth in\r\ndescent from Roger de Walcot was John Walcot, of whom the pedigree\r\nrelates, \"that playing at Chess with King Henry V. he gave him the\r\ncheck-mate with the rooke, whereupon the King changed his coat of\r\narms, which was the cross with fleurs-de-lis, and gave him the rooke\r\nfor a remembrance.\" Walcot was sold in the year 1764, and Bitterley,\r\nwhich had belonged to the family in 1660, became the seat of the\r\nWalcots, descended from Humphry Walcot, who died in 1616, and who\r\nwas the eldest son of John Walcot of Walcot.

Diddlebury was sold to the Cornewalls of Berrington in\r\nthe last century, when the Baldwins removed to Aqualate in\r\nStaffordshire. Kinlet was the inheritance of the Childes, whose\r\ncoheiress married Charles Baldwin, Esq.

It is probable that the Lord of Edge\r\nwas son of Edwin, who before the Conquest was sole proprietor of\r\neight manors; we may call him a Saxon thane. It appears by Domesday\r\nthat Dot was the Saxon lord of sixteen manors, from all of which he\r\nwas ejected; we may presume he was identical with Cadwgan Dot.\" \"A\r\ndescent in the male line (adds Ormerod) from a Saxon noticed in\r\nDomesday would be unique in this county\" (Cheshire). The Dods of\r\nCloverley descend from Hugo, living in the fourteenth of Henry IV.,\r\nwho married the coheiress of Roger de Cloverley. He was the son of\r\nJohn Dod of Farndon, who was son of Roger Dod of Edge, living in the\r\nreign of Edward III., which John Dod had also acquired property in\r\nShropshire, by marriage with the coheiress of Warden of Ightfield.\r\n\r\nSee Ormerod's Cheshire, ii. 374; and Blakeway, p. 206.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Argent, a fess gules between two cotises wavy sable_. The\r\nDods of Edge bore three crescents or, on the fess, by which one\r\nwould imagine they were the younger rather than the elder line of\r\nthe family, and the present owner of Cloverly possesses deeds which\r\nappear to prove that this was the fact.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, John Whitehall Dod, Esq. late M.P. for North\r\nShropshire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOAKELEY OF OAKELEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] An ancient family, descended from Philip, who in the\r\nreign of Henry III. was lord of Oakeley in the parish of Bishop's\r\nCastle, from whence he assumed his name, and which has ever since\r\nbeen the inheritance of his descendants.\r\n\r\nYounger Branch.

The family afterwards removed into\r\nthe north of the county, by marriages with the coheiresses of\r\nWlenkeslow, Buntingsdale, Styche, and Warren. The castle still borne\r\nin the coat of Hill is found on the seal of William Hill in the\r\nreign of Richard II.

The immediate\r\nancestors of the present family were of Aldershot, in this county,\r\nbeing descended from the second son of the first Baronet. Henry\r\nTichborne, grandson of the celebrated Sir Henry Tichborne, so\r\ndistinguished during the Great Rebellion in Ireland, and who was\r\nfourth son of the first Baronet, was raised to the peerage in\r\nIreland as Baron Ferrard in 1715; he died, and the peerage became\r\nextinct, in 1728.\r\n\r\nSee Wotton's Baronetage, i. 425; Collectanea Topographica et\r\nGenealogica, vii. p. 213; and for a notice of Chidiock Tichborne,\r\nengaged in the Babington Conspiracy in 1586, see Disraeli's\r\nCuriosities of Literature, 1st series, vol. iii. p. 95.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Vair, a chief or_, borne by Sir John Tichborne in the sixth\r\nof Henry IV.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Sir Alfred Joseph, Doughty Tichborne, 11th\r\nBaronet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOGLANDER OF NUNWELL, BARONET 1665.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] Richard de Okelandre, the patriarch of his family, is\r\nsupposed to have been of Norman origin, and was Lord of Nunwell, in\r\nthe Isle of Wight, the present seat, from the time of King John.\r\nSeventeenth in direct male descent from Richard, was Sir John\r\nOglander, Knt., a great sufferer, both in person and fortune, for\r\nhis zealous attachment to his sovereign King Charles I.

Robert\r\nWallop, grandson of Sir Henry, unfortunately taking part against his\r\nsovereign Charles I., and sitting as one of his judges, though he\r\ndid not sign the fatal warrant, fell into universal contempt after\r\nthe Restoration, and died in the Tower of London in 1667.

In the reign of Henry\r\nIII. they were of Over-Peover in the same county, and remained there\r\nuntil the principal male line became extinct in the person of Sir\r\nHenry Mainwaring of Peover, Baronet, who died unmarried in 1797.\r\nWhitmore was inherited by Edward ninth son of Sir John Mainwaring of\r\nPeover, on his marriage with the heiress of Humphry de Boghey or\r\nBohun of Whitmore. This was in the year 1519. The senior line of the\r\nMainwarings were on the loyal side during the great Rebellion, and\r\nin 1745 opposed to the pretensions of the house of Stuart. But the\r\nWhitmore branch favoured the Parliamentary interest.\r\n\r\nYounger Branch.

The name of Arden was assumed\r\nfrom the Woodlands of Arden, in the North of Warwickshire, by Siward\r\nde Arden, in the reign of Henry I.; which Siward was grandson of\r\nAlwin the Sheriff in the reign of Edward the Confessor. The elder\r\nline of the family was long seated at Park-Hall in Warwickshire, and\r\nbecame extinct in 1643. A younger branch descended from Simon second\r\nson of Thomas Arden, of Park-Hall, Esq. settled at Longcroft, in the\r\nparish of Yoxall, in the reign of Elizabeth, and now represents this\r\nmost ancient and noble family.\r\n\r\nSee Dugdale's Warwickshire, 2nd edit. vol. ii. p. 295; Shaw's\r\nStaffordshire, vol. i. p. 102; and Erdeswick, p. 279; also a paper\r\nby George Ormerod, Esq.

A younger son at this\r\nperiod was seated at Yeaveley, his grandson at Willington, both in\r\nDerbyshire. Bradley, in the same county, became in the seventeenh\r\ncentury, by purchase, the residence of a still younger branch,\r\ndescended from Francis, fourth son of Godfrey Meynell of Willington:\r\nfrom him descends the present family, who were of Hore-Cross the\r\nlatter part of the last century. Temple-Newsom, in Yorkshire, was\r\ninherited from the Ingrams by the present Mr. Meynell on the death\r\nof the Marchioness of Hertford in 1835.\r\n\r\nYounger Branch.

Erdeswick observes, \"It would seem that\r\nthe Cotes's should derive themselves from the Knightleys, or else\r\nthey do the Knightleys wrong by usurping their armoury.\" It may be\r\nremarked that Robert, third in descent from the first Robert de\r\nCotes, married a daughter of Richard de Knightley, and from hence\r\nperhaps the arms.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, John Cotes, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONGREVE OF CONGREVE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] The name, like those of most ancient families, is\r\nlocal, derived from Congreve, in this county, where the ancestors of\r\nthis house were seated soon after the Conquest.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Edward II. William Congreve removed to the adjoining\r\nvillage of Stretton, having married the heiress of Campion of that\r\nplace.

By marriage with the heiress of Tunstall\r\nthey had other lands in that parish, and for two descents were\r\ncalled Snead alias Tunstall. Bradwell, the former seat of this\r\nfamily, was purchased in the reign of Henry IV. The fine old house\r\nat Keel, lately taken down and now rebuilt, was erected by Ralph\r\nSneyd, Esq. in 1581. During the Usurpation, the Sneyds being on the\r\nloyal side, Keel house narrowly escaped destruction, and many of the\r\nancient evidences were plundered and lost at that time.\r\n\r\nYounger Branches. Sneyd of Ashcombe, and of Loxley in this county,\r\ndescended from the second son of William Sneyd, of Keel, who died in\r\n1694: and the Sneyds of Ireland, descended from Wettenhall,\r\nArchdeacon of Kilmore, younger brother of the ancestor of the\r\npreceding branches.\r\n\r\nSee Erdeswick, pp. 20, 25; Leland's Itinerary in Coll.

The Lanes can be traced to Adam de Lone de Hampton,\r\ngrandfather of Richard de le Lone de Hampton, in the ninth of Edward\r\nII. (1315). The three last Lanes of Bentley each lessened the\r\nestate, mainly from their devotion to the ill-fated house of Stuart;\r\nand the fourth, John Lane, sold Bentley in 1748. This family, even\r\nmore than the Giffords and Whitgreaves, can lay claim to be\r\nremembered for its loyalty to Charles II. after his flight from\r\nWorcester. The celebrated Jane Lane was the daughter of the then\r\nhead of the house, and rode behind the King from Bentley to Bristol.\r\nKing's Bromley was inherited from the Newtons about the end of the\r\nlast century.\r\n\r\nSee Erdeswick, pp. 235, 410; Shaw's Staffordshire, vol. ii. p. 97;\r\nGent.

The present\r\nfamily descended from Thomas Barnardiston, a merchant in London, who\r\ndied in 1681, fifth son of Sir Thomas of Ketton, Knight, and Mary,\r\ndaughter of Sir Richard Knightley. Besides the elder and principal\r\nline of Ketton, other branches were of Brightwell in this county,\r\n(created Baronets in 1663, extinct in 1721,) and of Northill, co.\r\nBedford, extinct in 1778.\r\n\r\nSee Wotton's Baronetage, iii. 396; and Davy's Suffolk Collections in\r\nthe British Museum, Add.

(1231). Sir Thomas Brooke died in the\r\nseventeenth of Henry VI. From his eldest son descended the Barons\r\nCobham; from Reginald the second son sprung the present family. He\r\nwas seated at Aspel, in Suffolk, and here his descendants continued\r\nfor nine generations. Ufford came from the heiress of Thomson in\r\n1761.\r\n\r\nSee Davy's Suffolk Collections, Add.

There is some uncertainty as to who this Thomas Hervey\r\nwas; the peerages indeed assume that he was younger brother of Sir\r\nGeorge Hervey, of Thurleigh, in Bedfordshire; Mr. Gages however has\r\nproved that this could not have been the case, but the Rev. Lord\r\nArthur Hervey in his interesting Memoir on Ickworth and the Hervey\r\nfamily, has adduced several reasons by which it would seem that\r\nThomas Hervey was a younger son of John Hervey, senior, of\r\nThurleigh, and the coheiress of Niernuyt, and uncle of Sir George,\r\nthe last of the legitimate elder line of that knightly family.\r\n\r\nYounger Branch.

The pedigree is traced to Richard Heigham, who died in 1340;\r\nhis grandson Thomas was of Heigham, and died in 1409. The elder line\r\nended in co-heiresses in 1558. A younger branch was seated at\r\nBarrow, and continued there till 1714, founded by Clement, fourth\r\nson of Thomas Heigham, of Heigham, Esq., who died in 1492.

His great-grandson, Thomas, was lord of Thurnby, in the\r\nsame county, in the ninth of Edward II. (1316); from him descended\r\nSir Edward Bray, who died in 1558. Harleston, also in the county of\r\nNorthampton, was an ancient seat of the Bray family, which rose into\r\nopulence with the success of Henry VII. after the Battle of\r\nBosworth, where Sir Reginald Bray, the devoted adherent of the King,\r\nwas said to have discovered the crown in a thorn-bush, in memory of\r\nwhich he afterwards bore for his badge, \"a thorn with a crown in the\r\nmiddle of it.\" Shere was granted, with many other manors, to Sir\r\nReginald as a reward for his services. The present family spring\r\nfrom Reginald, eldest son by the first wife of Sir Edward Bray, son\r\nof John, and nephew of the celebrated Sir Reginald. Edmund Lord Bray\r\nwas elder brother of Sir Edward; he had an only son, John Lord Bray,\r\nwho died s. p. in 1557.\r\n\r\nOf this family was William Bray, Esq., Treasurer of the Society of\r\nAntiquaries, and joint Historian of Surrey.\r\n\r\nSee Leland's Itinerary, viii. 113, a; and Manning and Bray's Surrey,\r\nvol. i. p. 514-523.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Argent, a chevron between three eagle's legs sable erased a\r\nla cuisse, their talons gules_.

It appears, however, certain that he was the\r\nson of George Perceval, of Tykenham, in the county of Somerset, by\r\nElizabeth Bampfylde, and fifth in descent from Richard Perceval, of\r\nWeston-Gordein, in the same county, who died between 1433 and 1439,\r\nthe representative of a family who had been seated there from the\r\nreign of Richard I., and who claim to be descended from the House of\r\nYvery in Normandy.

The younger branch, the\r\nancestors of the present family, were seated in the county of\r\nCork in Ireland, and in the eighteenth century at Enmore in\r\nSomersetshire, sold after the death of the fifth Earl of Egmont.\r\nNork House was the seat of Lord Arden, father of the present Earl,\r\nand brother of the third Earl of Egmont.\r\n\r\nSee \"A Genealogical History of the House of Yvery, &c.\" 8vo. 1742;\r\nand Collinson's History of Somersetshire, vol. iii. p. 171.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Argent, on a chief indented gules three crosses patée of the\r\nfirst_.

In the reign of Edward II., the Westons were of\r\nWest-Clandon, and also of Weston in Albury, and of Send and Ockham,\r\nin this county.

The first recorded ancestor is John de\r\nOndeslowe, whose grandson, Warin, was father of \"Roger de Ondeslow\r\njuxta Shrewsbury,\" whose son Thomas was living in the twelfth of\r\nEdward II. 1318. Richard Onslow became Speaker of the House of\r\nCommons, and died in 1571. He was the first of his family connected\r\nwith Surrey, by his marriage with Catherine, daughter and heir of\r\nRichard Harding, of Knoll, in this county, in the year 1554.\r\nWest-Clandon was purchased in 1641 by Sir Richard Onslow, created a\r\nBaronet in 1660; the ancient family estate of Onslow having been\r\nsold by Edward Onslow in 1617.\r\n\r\nYounger Branches. Onslow of Altham in the county of Lancaster,\r\nBaronet 1797, descended from the next brother of the Right Hon.\r\nArthur Onslow, Speaker of the House of Commons from 1726 to\r\n1761. Onslow of Staughton, in the county of Huntingdon, descended\r\nfrom the second son of Sir Richard Onslow, the first Baronet.\r\n\r\nSee Brydges's Collins, vol. v. p. 461; Manning and Bray's Surrey,\r\nvol. ii. p. 723; and Blakeway's Sheriffs of Shropshire, p. 90,\r\ncorrected by the MSS. of Mr. Joseph Morris.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Argent, a fess gules between six Cornish choughs proper_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Arthur George Onslow, third Earl of\r\nOnslow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUSSEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Knightly.+\r\n\r\n\r\nASHBURNHAM OF ASHBURNHAM, EARL OF ASHBURNHAM 1730; BARON 1689.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] \"A family of stupendous antiquity,\" writes Fuller.\r\n\"The most ancient family in these tracts,\" according to Camden.\r\n\"Genealogists have given them a Saxon origin,\" says Brydges; \"but\r\nthat is a fact very difficult to be proved, though very commonly\r\nasserted. They do not, I believe, appear in Domesday Book.\" There\r\ncan be no doubt, however, that the Ashburnhams have been seated at\r\nAshburnham from the reign of Henry II., and probably from a much\r\nearlier period, and are descended from Bertram, Constable of Dover\r\nin the reign of William the Conqueror. By the improvidence of Sir\r\nJohn Ashburnham, who died in 1620, this ancient patrimony was lost\r\nfor a time, but recovered by Frances Holland, the wife of his eldest\r\nson John (the groom of the bed-chamber to Charles I.), who sold her\r\nwhole estate, and laid out the money in redeeming Ashburnham.\r\n\r\nYounger Branch. Ashburnham of Bromham in this county, Baronet 1661,\r\ndescended from Richard, second son of Thomas Ashburnham, living in\r\nthe reign of Henry VI.\r\n\r\nSee Brydges's Collins, vol. iv. p. 249; and Wotton's Baronetage,\r\nvol. iii. p. 283.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Gules, a fess between six mullets argent_. The earliest seal\r\nremaining of any of the ancestors of this family is, I believe, that\r\nof \"Stephen de Esburne,\" great-grandson of Bertram, the Constable of\r\nDover: the device is a slip or branch of Ash. His grandson, \"Richard\r\nde Hasburnan,\" bore the Maltravers fret, his mother being daughter\r\nof Sir John Maltravers: the present coat was borne by Sir John de\r\nAschebornham, in the reign of Edward II.

Burton, in this county, was the seat of the\r\nprincipal and elder line of the family, created Baronets in 1662,\r\nextinct in 1723. Of a younger branch was the celebrated George Lord\r\nGoring 1628, Earl of Norwich 1644, (which titles were extinct on the\r\ndeath of his third son, but heir, the second Lord, in 1670,) sprung\r\nfrom the second son of Sir William Gorynge, of Burton, who died in\r\n1553.\r\n\r\nThe present family is descended from the second son of Sir Henry\r\nGoring, of Burton, Knight, who died in 1594. Highden was purchased\r\nin 1647.\r\n\r\nYounger Branch. Goring of Wiston, Sussex, descended from the second\r\nmarriage of Sir Charles Matthew Goring, of Highden, the fourth\r\nBaronet, and the co-heiress of Fagg.\r\n\r\nSee Dallaway's Rape of Arundel, p. 281, who refers to Evidences\r\nrelating to the family of Goring, MSS.

In the 28th of Edward I., Walter\r\nde Pelham had a confirmation grant of lands in Heilsham, Horsey, &c.\r\nin this county. From the reign of Edward III. the Pelhams have been\r\na most important Sussex family; it was in that reign that Sir John\r\nPelham assumed the Buckle as his badge, in token of his claim to the\r\nhonour of taking John King of France prisoner at the battle of\r\nPoictiers. Laughton belonged to the Pelhams before 1403, but has\r\nbeen long deserted as the residence of the family.\r\n\r\nSee Brydges's Collins, vol. v. p. 488; Horsfield's Lewes; and\r\nSussex Archaeological Collections, vol. iii. p. 211, for a curious\r\npaper on the arms and badges of the Pelhams.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Quarterly,_ 1 _and_ 4_, Azure, three pelicans argent,\r\nvulning themselves proper;_ 2 _and_ 3_, Gules, two belts in pale\r\nargent with buckles and studs or_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Henry Thomas Pelham, 3rd Earl of Chichester.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHELLEY OF MARESFIELD, BARONET 1611.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] Although there is no doubt of the antiquity of the\r\nhouse of Shelley, the accounts of the earlier descents of the family\r\nare very scanty. Originally of the county of Huntingdon, the\r\nShelleys are said to have removed into this county at a very early\r\nperiod. But the earliest mention we have in history of any of this\r\nfamily is of John and Thomas Shelley, who, following the fortunes of\r\nRichard II., were attainted and beheaded in the first year of Henry\r\nIV. The remaining brother, Sir William Shelley, not being connected\r\nwith the followers of Richard II., retained his possessions, and was\r\nthe ancestor of this family, who in the reign of Henry VI., by a\r\nmatch with the heiress of Michelgrove, of Michelgrove, in Clapham,\r\nwas seated at that place, which continued the residence of the\r\nShelleys until the year 1800, when it was sold, and Maresfield\r\nbecame the family seat.\r\n\r\nYounger Branches. Shelley or Castle-Goring, Baronet 1806,\r\ndescended from the fourth son of Sir John Shelley, of Michelgrove,\r\nwho died in 1526. Shelley of Avington, in the county of Southampton,\r\nand Shelley (called Sidney Foulis) Lord de L'Isle and Dudley 1835,\r\ndescended from the second marriage of Sir Bysshe Shelley, of\r\nCastle-Goring, Baronet, and the heiress of Perry, of Penshurst.,\r\n\r\nSee Wotton's Baronetage, vol. i. p. 39; Cartwright's Topography of\r\nthe Rape of Bramber, p. 76; and Dallaway's Rape of Arundel, p. 40.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Sable, a fess engrailed between three whelk-shells or_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Sir John Villiers Shelley, 7th Baronet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWEST OF BUCKHURST, EARL DE LA WARR 1761; BARON 1427.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] The Wests are remarkable, not so much for the\r\nantiquity of the family as for the early period at which they\r\nattained the honour of the peerage. Sir Thomas West is the first\r\nrecorded ancestor; he died in the seventeenth of Edward II., having\r\nmarried the heiress of Cantilupe, and thus became possessed of lands\r\nin Devonshire, and at Snitterfield in Warwickshire. His grandson,\r\nThomas, married the heiress of De la Warr, and thus became connected\r\nwith Sussex. But the principal property of the Wests in this county\r\nwas granted to Thomas West, afterwards Lord la Warr, in the first\r\nyear of Henry VII. Few families indeed had broader lands; among\r\nwhich may be mentioned, Offington, in the parish of Broadwater,\r\nderived from the heiress of Peverel at the end of the fourteenth\r\ncentury; and Halnaker, in the parish of Boxgrove, both in Sussex;\r\nand Wherwell, in Hampshire; all now alienated. Buckhurst came to the\r\npresent Lord by his marriage with the coheiress of Sackville.\r\n\r\nYounger Branch. West of Ruthyn Castle, Denbighshire, descended from\r\nthe younger son of John, second Earl De la Warr.\r\n\r\nThe Wests of Alscot, in the county of Gloucester, claim to be\r\ndescended from Leonard, the younger son of Sir Thomas West, Lord De\r\nla Warr, K.G., who died in the year 1525, although there is nothing\r\nbut \"family tradition,\" as is evident by the memorial to the Earl\r\nMarshal of Mr. James West, of Alscot, dated December 12, 1768, to\r\njustify this assumption; a distinct coat, viz. _Argent, a fess\r\ndancette pean_, was granted to Mr. West on this occasion.\r\n\r\nSee Brydges's Collins, vol. v. p. i.; Blore's Rutlandshire, p. 100;\r\nCartwright's Rape of Bramber, p. 38; and Dallaway's Rape of\r\nChichester, pp. 129, 133.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Argent, a fess dancette sable_. The badge of the De-la-Warrs\r\nwas a crampet or shape of a sword; assumed by Roger la-Warr, Lord\r\nla-Warr, for having assisted Sir John Pelham in making John King of\r\nFrance prisoner at the Battle of Poictiers.

He married Elianor,\r\nsecond daughter and coheiress of Thomas St.Clere, of Heighton St.\r\nClere, in Sussex, and acquired by this marriage several manors in\r\nthis county, as well as in Surrey, Kent, Buckinghamshire, and\r\nNorthamptonshire. The present family, seated at Firle from this\r\nperiod, descend from his eldest son. From his second son sprung the\r\nGages of Raunds, in Northamptonshire, sold in 1675.\r\n\r\nYounger Branch. Gage of Hengrave, in Suffolk, Baronet 1622,\r\ndescended from Edward, third son of Sir John Gage, of Firle, who\r\ndied in 1633.\r\n\r\nSee Gage's Hengrave, p. 225; Gage's Hundred of Thingoe, p. 204;\r\nBridges's History of Northamptonshire, vol. ii. p. 188; Wotton's\r\nBaronetage, vol. i. p. 503, vol. iii. p. 366; Brydges's Collins,\r\nvol. viii. p. 249; and Leland's Itinerary, vol. iv. p. 12.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Party per saltier argent and azure, a saltier gules_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Henry Hall Gage, 4th Viscount Gage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n+Gentle.+\r\n\r\n\r\nBARTTELOT OF STOPHAM.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] The head of this family, according to Dallaway, may\r\nbe considered one of the most ancient proprietors of land residing\r\nupon his estate in this county. The first in the pedigree is Adam de\r\nBartelott, said to be of Norman origin, father of John, who married\r\nJoan Stopham, coheiress of lands in the manor from whence the name\r\nis derived. He died in 1428, and Stopham has ever since remained the\r\ninheritance of their descendants.\r\n\r\nSee the Topographer, vol. iv. p. 346; and Cartwright's edition of\r\nDallaway's Rape of Arundel, p. 347.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Sable, three falconer's sinister gloves pendent argent,\r\ntasseled or_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, George Barttelot, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURTHOPE OF WYLEIGH.\r\n\r\n[Illustration] From the reign of King Edward I., this family has\r\nbeen settled at Wadhurst, Lamberhurst, Ticehurst, and the adjoining\r\nparishes on the borders of Sussex and Kent: at Goudhurst, in the\r\nlatter county, they held the manors of Bockingfield and the Pillery\r\nfrom the year 1413 to 1498, and in 1513 Wyleigh, in the parish of\r\nTicehurst, was acquired by John Courthope in marriage with his wife\r\nElizabeth, daughter of William Saunders of Wyleigh. From this\r\nmarriage sprung three sons, John, George, and Thomas; the issue male\r\nof the eldest has been long extinct; from the second, who had\r\nWyleigh, is descended the present Representative of the family; and\r\nfrom the third and youngest, who succeeded to the estate of\r\n\"Courthope\" in Goudhurst, is descended William Courthope, Esq.\r\nSomerset Herald.\r\n\r\nSee Collectanea Topog. et Genealog., vol. ii. pp. 279, 363; and The\r\nVisitation of Sussex, C. 27, in Coll.

Until the reign of Edward III., Eatington appears to\r\nhave continued the principal seat of the Shirleys, whose name was\r\nassumed in the twelfth century from the manor of Shirley, in\r\nDerbyshire, and which, with Ratcliffe-on-Sore, in the county of\r\nNottingham, and Rakedale and Staunton-Harold, in Leicestershire,\r\nderived from the heiresses of Basset and Staunton, succeeded, during\r\nthe fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, as the usual residence of\r\nthe chiefs of the house. In the sixteenth century, Astwell, in\r\nNorthamptonshire, was brought into the family by the heiress of\r\nLovett; and in 1615, by the marriage of Sir Henry Shirley with the\r\ncoheiress of Devereux, a moiety of the possessions of the Earls of\r\nEssex, after the extinction of that title in 1646, centred in Sir\r\nRobert Shirley, father of the first Earl Ferrers; on whose death, in\r\n1717, the family estates were divided, the Derbyshire,\r\nLeicestershire, and Staffordshire estates descending with the\r\nearldom to the issue of his first marriage, and the Warwickshire\r\nproperty, the original seat of the Shirleys, eventually to the\r\ngreat-grandfather of the present possessor, the eldest surviving\r\nson of the second marriage of the first Earl Ferrers.\r\n\r\nElder Branches.* Shirley of Staunton-Harold, in the county of\r\nLeicester, represented by Sewallis Edward, tenth Earl Ferrers 1711;\r\nand Shirley of Shirley, in the county of Derby, represented by the\r\nRev.

Shirley, of Wiston, Preston,\r\nWest-Grinstead, and Ote-Hall, all in Sussex, and all descended from\r\nthe second marriage of Ralph Shirley, Esq., and Elizabeth Blount;\r\nwhich Ralph died in 1466.

Indeed Sir\r\nRalph Shirley bore it as late as the reign of Edward II; see\r\nNicolas's Roll of that date, p. 73. Sir Hugh de Shirley bore the\r\npresent coat (Roll of Richard II.): so did his father Sir Thomas,\r\nand his great-grandfather Sir James, as appears by their several\r\nseals engraved in Upton, &c.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Evelyn Philip Shirley, Esq., late M.

The descendants of\r\nwhich Peter and Amicia had their principal seat at Kingsbury till\r\nabout the beginning of Queen Elizabeth's reign, when it was sold,\r\nand the Atherstone estate purchased. \"Kinisbyri is a fair manor\r\nplace,\" writes Leland, in his Itinerary, \"and lordship of 140 li.;\r\none Bracebridge is lord of it; it is in Warwikshir.\" At Bracebridge,\r\non the river Witham, near Lincoln, the original seat of the family,\r\nso called it is supposed from the two bridges which still exist\r\nthere, a grant of free warren was obtained in the 29th of Edward I.,\r\nwhich was still retained by Thomas Bracebridge, Esq. who died in\r\n1567.\r\n\r\nThe Bracebridges represent the Holtes of Aston, near Birmingham,\r\nand, through that ancient family, the Breretons of Cheshire.\r\n\r\nSee Dugdale's Warwickshire, vol. ii. p. 1057-1061; Nichols's\r\nLeicestershire, vol. iii. part ii. p. 1145; for Holte, see Dugdale's\r\nWarwickshire, vol. ii. p. 871, and Davidson's History of the Holtes\r\nof Aston, fol. 1854; for Brereton, see Ormerod's Cheshire, vol. iii.\r\npt. 31.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Vair, argent and sable, a fess gules_.

Arnulphus de Compton and Osbertus de Compton were\r\nliving in the 16th of Henry II., but Philip de Compton is the first\r\nof the name who certainly held the manor of Compton, in the fifth of\r\nJohn. Here the family continued resident for many ages; but its\r\nimportance arose in a great degree from Sir William Compton having\r\nbeen brought up with Henry Duke of York, afterwards Henry VIII., and\r\nfrom the marriage of his great-grandson, the first Earl of\r\nNorthampton, with the City Heiress of Spencer.\r\n\r\nThe Comptons were pre-eminently distinguished for loyalty during the\r\nCivil Wars of the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nSee Dugdale's Warwickshire, vol. i. p. 549; and Brydges's Collins,\r\nvol. iii. p. 223.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Sable, a lion of England or between three esquire's helmets\r\nargent_. A former coat, borne by Thomas de Comptone, apparently\r\nabout the reign of Edward III., was a chevron charged with three\r\nfleurs-de-lis. This is proved by a silver seal dug up at Compton in\r\nthe year 1845; and the same arms are still to be traced on an\r\nancient mutilated monument of a knight with collar of S.S., supposed\r\nto represent Sir Thomas de Compton, in the church of Compton\r\nWyniate. The three helmets were afterwards adopted, and appear to\r\nhave been the arms of a distinct family, the Comptons of Fenny\r\nCompton in this county; to which Henry VIII. gave the lion as an\r\naugmentation; at the same time, according to the custom of the\r\nperiod, was added a quartering to the family arms, viz.: _Argent, a\r\nchevron azure, within a border vert bezantee_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Charles Douglas Compton, 3rd Marquess of\r\nNorthampton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHETWYND OF GRENDON, BARONET 1795.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] The younger, but, in England, the only remaining\r\nbranch of a very ancient family, denominated from Chetwynd, in\r\nShropshire, and of Baxterly, in this county, in the 37th of Henry\r\nIII. Sir William Chetwind was the first of the name seated at\r\nGrendon, in the 39th of Edward III., his mother being daughter and\r\ncoheir of Sir Ralph de Grendon; but Ingestre, in Staffordshire,\r\nwhich came from the heiress of Mutton, was the principal seat of the\r\nChetwinds, which was eventually carried by an heiress into the\r\nTalbot family (now Earl of Shrewsbury).\r\n\r\nElder Branch.

The name is derived from Rin_felden_, in Germany, where,\r\nand at Lauffenburg, were the patrimonial possessions of the house of\r\nHapsburg. Newnham was in possession of John Fildying in the twelfth\r\nof Henry VI., inherited from his mother Joan, daughter and heir of\r\nWilliam Prudhome.\r\n\r\nSee Dugdale's Warwickshire, vol. i. p. 86; Brydges's Collins' vol.\r\niii. p. 265; and Nichols's Leicestershire, vol. iv. pt. i. p. 273,\r\nfor the history of this illustrious family, compiled by Nathaniel\r\nWanley about the year 1670.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Argent, on a fess azure three fusils or_.

The first of the line seated in\r\nWarwickshire was Thomas Staunton, in the 39th of Henry VI., 1461.\r\nThe parent house, existing in the male line, until the year 1688, at\r\nStaunton, in Nottinghamshire, held their lands by tenure of\r\n_Castle-Guard_, by keeping and defending a tower in the Castle of\r\nBelvoir, to this day called Staunton Tower. There is an ancient\r\ncustom also that the chief of the house of Staunton should present\r\nthe key of this tower to any of the Royal Family who may honour\r\nBelvoir with their presence.\r\n\r\nYounger Branch. Staunton of Wolverton, in this county, settled there\r\nin the eighteenth of Elizabeth; extinct in the last century.\r\n\r\nSee Dugdale's Warwickshire, vol. ii. p. 665; Thoroton's\r\nNottinghamshire, p. 157; and for the poetical pedigree of this\r\nhouse, Ib. p. 159; the monuments at p. 164; see also \"Memoirs of the\r\nLife and Family of the late Sir G.

Illustrious\r\nboth for the antiquity of race, the former political consequence,\r\nand the splendour of connection of the various branches, of which\r\nthe forfeited Earls of Derby, and De Ferrariis, or Ferrers, were the\r\nchiefs. Descended from Henry de Feriers at the time of the Conquest,\r\nwho held in chief 210 lordships in fourteen counties of England,\r\nbesides the castle and borough of Tutbury, in Staffordshire, the\r\nprincipal seat of the earldom.\r\n\r\nThe Baddesley-Clinton line was founded by Sir Edward Ferrers, (son\r\nof Sir Henry, who was second son of Thomas Ferrers, of Tamworth\r\nCastle, in this county,) by his marriage with Constantia, daughter\r\nand heiress of Nicholas Brome, of Baddesley. He died in 1535.\r\n\r\nAfter the forfeiture of the Earldom of Derby, in the reign of Henry\r\nIII., and the vast possessions attached to it, the Castle of\r\nChartley, in Staffordshire, inherited from Agnes, daughter and\r\ncoheir of Ranulph, Earl of Chester, became the seat of the principal\r\nmale line, extinct on the death of William Lord Ferrers of Chartley\r\nin the 28th of Henry VI. The representation of the family thereupon\r\ndevolved on the Ferrers's of Tamworth, sprung from the house of\r\nGroby, who were founded by William, younger brother of the last Earl\r\nof Derby: and on the decease of John Ferrers, of Tamworth, Esq. in\r\n1680, the present family of Baddesley-Clinton succeeded as chief of\r\nthis illustrious house.\r\n\r\nSee Dugdale's Warwickshire, vol. ii. p. 971, for\r\nBaddesley-Clinton, where however will be found no engravings\r\nof the monuments of the Ferrers's, \"because,\" says Dugdale, \"so\r\nfrugall a person is the present heir of the family, now (1656)\r\nresiding here, as that he refusing to contribute anything towards\r\nthe charge thereof, they are omitted.\" For Ferrers of Chartley, and\r\nthe Earls of Derby, see Sir O. Mosley's History of Tutbury, 8vo.\r\n1832; and Dugdale's Warwickshire, vol. ii. p. 1089; and for Ferrers\r\nof Tamworth, the same, p. 1135.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Gules, seven mascles or, a canton ermine_. This was the coat\r\nof Quinci, Earl of Winchester, from whom the Ferrers of Groby were\r\ndescended, the canton being added for difference. The original coat\r\nassigned to the first Earls of Derby, was, _Argent, six horseshoes\r\nsable_; afterwards, _Vair or and gules, within a bordure of\r\nhorseshoes_, was used. The Chartley line bore only, _Vair, or and\r\ngules_, which was latterly also borne by Ferrers of Tamworth. The\r\nQuinci coat was used by William de Ferrers at Carlaverock in 1300.\r\n(See the Roll.)\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Marmion Edward Ferrers, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMORDAUNT OF WALTON, BARONET 1611.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] Turvey in Bedfordshire was the principal seat in\r\nEngland of this noble Norman family, descended from Osbert le\r\nMordaunt, who came over from Normandy with William the Conqueror,\r\nand received a grant of the lordship of Radwell in that county. In\r\n1529, John Mordaunt, the representative of the family, was summoned\r\nto Parliament by writ as Baron Mordaunt of Turvey. His\r\ngreat-great-grandson was created Earl of Peterborough in 1628; which\r\ntitle, together with the elder line of the family, became\r\nextinct on the decease of Charles-Henry Mordaunt, fifth Earl, in\r\n1814.\r\n\r\nThe present family descend from Robert, son of William Mordaunt of\r\nHemsted, in Essex, who was second son of William Mordaunt of Turvey,\r\nliving in the 11th of Henry IV., which Robert married Barbara,\r\ndaughter of John le Strange, of Massingham-Parva in Norfolk, and of\r\nWalton-D'Eivile, in this county, which since the 32nd year of Henry\r\nVIII., 1549-50, has remained the inheritance of their descendants.\r\n\r\nSee Dugdale's Warwickshire, vol. i. p. 577: Parkins's continuation\r\nof Blomefield's Norfolk, vol. iv. p. 643; and that very rare volume\r\ncompiled by order of the second Earl of Peterborough, called\r\n\"Halstead's Genealogies,\" fo. 1685, privately printed.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Argent, a chevron between three estoiles sable_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Sir Charles Mordaunt, 10th.

He was, it is said, of Norman descent, and is\r\nsupposed to have married the Saxon heiress of Biddulph, from whence\r\nthe name was afterwards assumed. The elder line terminated on the\r\ndeath of' John Biddulph, Esq. of Biddulph and of Burton in Sussex,\r\nin the year 1835. The Birdingbury branch, now representing this\r\nvenerable house, was founded by Symon, second son of Richard\r\nBiddulph, of Biddulph, in the time of Henry VIII., whose descendant,\r\nanother Symon, purchased Birdingbury in 1687. The family were\r\neminently loyal during the Civil Wars, when the ancient seat of\r\nBiddulph was destroyed by the Cromwellians about 1643-4.\r\n\r\nYounger Branch. Biddulph of Ledbury, in the county of Hereford,\r\ndescended from Anthony, younger brother of the first Baronet.\r\n\r\nSee Dugdale's Warwickshire, vol. i. p. 324; Shaw's History of\r\nStaffordshire, vol. i. p. 352; Erdeswick's Staffordshire, ed. 1844,\r\np. 8; Ward's History of the Borough of Stoke-upon-Trent, p. 277; and\r\nWotton's Baronetage, vol. iii. p. 442.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Vert, an eagle displayed argent, armed and langued gules_.\r\nArgent, three soldering-irons sable, is also said to have been borne\r\nby the Biddulphs.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Sir Theophilus William Biddulph, 7th\r\nBaronet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSKIPWITH OF HARBOROUGH, BARONET 1622 (FORMERLY OF NEWBOLD HALL).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] The name is derived from Skipwith, in the East Riding\r\nof Yorkshire, and was first borne by Patrick, living in the reign of\r\nHenry I., who was second son of Robert de Estotevile, Baron of\r\nCottingham in the reign of William the Conqueror. In the reign of\r\nHenry III. the Skipwiths removed into Lincolnshire, and were seated\r\nat Beckeby and Ormesby, in that county; a younger son of Sir\r\nWilliam Skipwith, of Ormesby, who died in 1587, was of Prestwould,\r\nin Leicestershire. He was the ancestor of the Skipwiths of Newbold\r\nHall, created Baronet in 1670, extinct in 1790, and of the present\r\nfamily, who for five generations were of Virginia, in America, where\r\nthe grandfather of the present Baronet was born.\r\n\r\nSee Dugdale's Warwickshire, vol. i. p. 84; Nichols's Leicestershire,\r\nvol. iii. pt. i. p. 368; and Wotton's Baronetage, vol. i. p. 536,\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Argent, three bars pules, in chief a greyhound courant\r\nsable_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Sir Peyton Estoteville Skipwith, 10th\r\nBaronet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n+Gentle.+\r\n\r\n\r\nSHUCKBURGH OF SHUCKBURGH, BARONET 1660.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] The antiquity of this family need not be doubted,\r\nalthough the lineal descent, as Dugdale avouches, is not very plain.\r\nWilliam de Suckeberge is presumed to be the first who assumed the\r\nname, from Shuckborough Superior, in this county; he was living in\r\nthe third of John. The pedigree is deduced by Baker, in his History\r\nof Northamptonshire, from John de Shuckburgh, living in the first of\r\nEdward III. In the seventh of Henry V. his great-grandson William is\r\nranked amongst those knights and esquires of this county who bore\r\nancient arms from their ancestors. It was to Richard Shuckburgh,\r\nhead of the family in 1642, that the remarkable incident happened\r\nwhich is related by Dugdale. Charles I. having met him hunting\r\nwith his hounds a day or two before the battle of Edgehill, \"Who is\r\nthat,\" said the King, \"hunting so merrily, while I am about to fight\r\nfor my crown and dignity?\" He was knighted the next day, and proved\r\nhis loyalty at the battle of Edge-hill. He died in 1656, and his son\r\nwas rewarded with the Baronetcy on the Restoration.\r\n\r\nYounger Branch. Shuckburgh of Downton, Wiltshire, descended from\r\nCharles, fourth son of the first Baronet.\r\n\r\nSee Dugdale's Warwickshire, vol. i. p. 309; Baker's\r\nNorthamptonshire, vol. i. p. 371; Wotton's Baronetage, vol. iii. p.\r\n76; and Hoare's Modern Wiltshire, vol. iv. p. 34.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Sable, a chevron between three mullets pierced argent_. This\r\ncoat is evidently founded on the arms of Danvers, the Norman family\r\nunder whom the Shuckburghs held: it has been fondly assumed that the\r\nmullets are allusive to the astroites found in the ploughed fields\r\nat Shuckburgh.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Sir Francis Shuckburgh, 8th Baronet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHROCKMORTON OF COUGHTON, BARONET 1642.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] The name is derived from Throcmorton, in the parish\r\nof Fladbury, in the county of Worcester, where John de Trockemerton,\r\nthe supposed ancestor of this family, was living about the year\r\n1200. From this John descended, after many generations, another\r\n\"John Throkmerton,\" who was, according the Leland, \"the first setter\r\nup of his name to any worship in Throkmerton village, the which was\r\nat that tyme neither of his inheritance or purchase, but as a\r\nthing taken of the Sete of Wircester in farme, bycause he bore the\r\nname of the lordeship and village. This John was Under-Treasurer of\r\nEngland about the tyme of Henry V.;\" and married Elianor, daughter\r\nand coheir of Guido de la Spine, and thus became possessed of\r\nCoughton, in the parish of Hadley, in this county, which has\r\ncontinued the principal seat of the family, of whom the most\r\nremarkable was Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, ambassador in France, in\r\nthe reign of Queen Elizabeth, who died in 1570.\r\n\r\nYounger Branches (now extinct), were the Throckmortons of Stoughton\r\nand Ellington, in Huntingdonshire, [for the latter see Camden's\r\nVisitation of that county in 1613, printed by the Camden Society in\r\n1849, p. 123;] and the Carews of Bedington, in Surrey, Baronet 1714,\r\nextinct 1764; descended in the male line from Sir Nicholas, younger\r\nson of Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, and Anne, daughter of Sir Nicholas\r\nCarew, Knt.; see Wotton's Baronetage, vol. ii. pi 351, and vol. iv.\r\np. 159; Dugdale's Warwickshire, vol. ii. pp. 749 and 819; Nash's\r\nWorcestershire, vol. i. p. 452; Leland's Itinerary, vol. iv. p. 16;\r\nand for the poetical life of Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, see Peck's\r\nMemoirs of Milton.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Gules, on a chevron argent three bars gemelles sable_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Sir Nicholas William Throckmorton, 9th\r\nBaronet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHELDON OF BRAILES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] The descent of this family from the ancient house of\r\nSheldon, of Sheldon, in this county, is a matter of doubt, but\r\nadmitted by Dugdale to be not improbable. It appears to be proved\r\nthat the Sheldons are descended from John Sheldon, of Abberton, in\r\nWorcestershire, in the reign of Henry IV. Nash, in his History of\r\nthat county, carries the pedigree two descents higher, viz., to\r\nRichard Sheldon of Rowley, in the county of Stafford, whose grandson\r\nJohn was of the same place in the fourth of Edward IV. The manor of\r\nBeoly, in Worcestershire, was purchased of Richard Neville Lord\r\nLatimer by William Sheldon in the same reign, and continued till the\r\ndestruction of the mansion-house by fire in the Civil Wars of the\r\nseventeenth century, the principal seat of the family, who were\r\nconnected with Warwickshire by the marriage of William Sheldon, Esq.\r\nwith Mary, daughter and coheir of William Willington, of Barcheston,\r\nEsq., in the reign of Henry VIII. It was this William Sheldon who\r\npurchased the manor of Weston, in the parish of Long-Compton, in\r\nthis county, and here his son Ralph built \"_a very fair house_\" in\r\nthe reign of Queen Elizabeth; but these estates have both, within\r\nthe memory of man, passed from this ancient family, who still\r\npossess considerable properly at Brailes, purchased by William\r\nSheldon in the first of Edward VI.\r\n\r\nYounger branches of the Sheldons were formerly of Abberton,\r\nChildswicombe, Broadway, and Spechley, in Worcestershire.

He it was who purchased\r\nMilcote, in this county, long the seat of the elder line of this\r\nfamily, who, after a succession of crimes, the particulars of which\r\nmay be seen in Dugdale's Warwickshire, became extinct in the\r\nreign of James I. Fulke, second son of Sir Edward Greville of\r\nMilcote, who died in the 20th of Henry VIII., having married\r\nElizabeth, one of the daughters and coheiress of Edward Willoughby,\r\nonly son of Robert Willoughby, Lord Brooke, became possessed of\r\nBeauchamp's Court, in the parish of Alcester, inherited from her\r\ngrandmother Elizabeth, the eldest of the daughters and coheirs of\r\nthe last Lord Beauchamp of Powyke. This Fulke Greville was\r\ngrandfather of the more celebrated Sir Fulke Greville, Lord Brooke,\r\n\"servant to Queen Elizabeth, Counsellor to King James, and friend to\r\nSir Philip Sidney,\" who died in 1628. \"The fanatic Brooke,\" killed\r\nat Lichfield Close, was his cousin and successor, and ancestor of\r\nthe present family. The Castle of Warwick was granted to Sir Fulke\r\nGreville by James I. in the second year of his reign.\r\n\r\nYounger Branch.

Other\r\nauthorities make Sir Hugh de Lowther, knight of the shire for this\r\ncounty, in the 28th of Edward I., the first recorded ancestor; his\r\ngreat-grandson was at Agincourt in 1415. There have been three\r\nprincipal branches of this family, the first descended from Sir John\r\nLowther, created a Baronet of Nova Scotia in 1640, who was\r\ngrandfather of the first Viscount Lonsdale (1696), extinct on the\r\ndeath of the third Viscount in 1750. The second family sprung from\r\nRichard, third son of Sir John Lowther; and the third and present\r\nfamily descended from William, third son of a former Sir John\r\nLowther, of Lowther, who died in 1637.\r\n\r\nYounger Branch.

A good account of this family, derived from\r\noriginal evidences, is given by Burn.\r\n\r\nSizergh, in the parish of Helsington, appears to have belonged to\r\nthe Stricklands in the reign of Edward I. Sir Walter de Strickland\r\nhad licence to empark there in the ninth of Edward III. During the\r\ncivil wars of the seventeenth century the head of this house was\r\nloyal, while Walter, son of Sir William Strickland, of Boynton,\r\nBaronet 1641, was one of Cromwell's pretended House of Peers. The\r\nStricklands of Boynton are supposed to be a younger branch of the\r\nhouse of Sizergh.

Woundy, Penhow, and Seymour Castle, all in the county of\r\nMonmouth, (the last sold in the reign of Henry VIII.,) were ancient\r\nseats of the family, who we find in the fourteenth century resident\r\nin Somersetshire, after the marriage of Sir Roger Seymour with the\r\ncoheiress of Beauchamp of Hache; his grandson married the heiress of\r\nEsturmi or Sturmey of Chadham, in this county, and thus first became\r\nconnected with Wiltshire. Maiden-Bradley belonged to Sir Edward\r\nSeymour, the elder, the eldest surviving son of the Protector\r\nSomerset by his first wife, and the ancestor of the present family,\r\nwho in 1750, on the death of the seventh Duke of Somerset, succeeded\r\nto the Dukedom, which by special entail went first to the\r\ndescendants of the Protector by his second wife, until the\r\nextinction of her male line in that year.\r\n\r\nYounger Branches. Seymour, of Knoyle, in this county, descended from\r\nFrancis, next brother of Edward eighth Duke of Somerset, and second\r\nson of Sir Edward Seymour, Baronet, of Maiden-Bradley, who died in\r\n1741. Seymour Marquess of Hertford, (1793,) descended from\r\nFrancis, son of Sir Edward Seymour, Bart., who died in 1708, and his\r\nsecond wife, Letitia, daughter of Francis Popham.\r\n\r\nSee Brydges's Collins, vol. i. p. 144, vol. ii. p. 560; Westcote's\r\nDevonshire Pedigrees, p. 479; and Wotton's Baronetage, vol. i. p.\r\n86.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Quarterly,_ 1 _and_ 4, _Or, on a pile gules between six\r\nfleurs-de-lis azure three lions of England;_ 2 _and_ 3, _Gules, two\r\nwings conjoined in lure of the first, the points downwards_.

Gilbert in his \"Survey of Cornwall,\" is\r\ninclined to believe the name to be derived from Arundel in Sussex,\r\nand refers to \"Yorke's Union of Honour.\" He says the family came\r\ninto Cornwall by a match with the heiress of Trembleth about the\r\nmiddle of the twelfth century. Lanherne, in that county, was in the\r\nfourteenth century their principal seat. The Castle of Wardour was\r\npurchased by Sir Thomas Arundell from Sir Fulke Greville in 1547.\r\n\r\nCamden, Carew, and Leland unite in recording the hospitality and\r\nhonourable demeanour of this family, in all relations of social\r\nlife, and state that from the pre-eminence of their ample\r\npossessions they were popularly designated \"The Great Arundells.\"\r\n\r\nSee Coll.

John Codrington, Esquire,\r\nStandard-bearer to Henry V. in his wars in France, was the direct\r\nancestor; he died in 1475, at the age, it is said, of 112; his\r\nmonument remains at Wapley.\r\n\r\nCodrington remained in the family till 1753, when it passed with an\r\nheiress to the Bamfyldes of Poltimore, and has since been\r\nre-purchased by the present owner of Dodington. Didmarton, also in\r\nGloucestershire, which came by marriage in 1570, and was afterwards\r\nsold, and latterly Wroughton, in this county, became the family\r\nseats.\r\n\r\nTwo younger branches have been seated at Dodington; the first,\r\ndescended from Thomas Codrington, brother of John the\r\nStandard-bearer, long settled at Frampton-on-Severn in\r\nGloucestershire, bought Dodington in the time of Queen Elizabeth and\r\nsold it at the beginning of the eighteenth century to the ancestor\r\nof the present family, Codrington of Dodington, in the county of\r\nGloucester, Baronet 1721, descended from Christopher, second son of\r\nRobert Codrington, who died in 1618.\r\n\r\nSee Atkyns's Gloucestershire, pp. 204 and 391; Rudder's\r\nGloucestershire, p. 787; and Wotton's Baronetage, vol. iv. p. 201.\r\nCorrected by the information of Mr. R.

The original\r\nname was Botfield, so called from Botfield in Stretton; the first on\r\nrecord being William de Bottefeld, sub-forester of Shirlet, in\r\nShropshire, in 1255. About the time of Edward IV. the elder line of\r\nthe family assumed the name of Thynne, otherwise Botfeld, which was\r\nborne for three generations before the time of Sir John Thynne, the\r\npurchaser of Longleate, who died in 1580, the ancestor of the\r\npresent family.\r\n\r\nYounger Branch represented by the late Beriah Botfield of\r\nNorton Hall, in the county of Northampton, and Decker Hill, co.\r\nSalop, descended from John, second son of Thomas Bottefeld, of\r\nBottefeld, living in 1439.\r\n\r\nSee the Topographer and Genealogist, vol. iii. p. 468; and the\r\nStemmata Botevilliana, (privately printed,) second edition, 1858,\r\n4to.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Barry of ten or and sable_.

Elias de Acton, of Ombersley, occurs in the third of\r\nHenry III. He was the ancestor of various branches of the Actons\r\nresident in different parts of this county, at Sutton, Ribbesford,\r\nElmley-Lovet, Bokelton, and Burton, all of whom now appear to be\r\nextinct, the male line being preserved by the present family,\r\nfounded by a younger son of Sir Roger Acton, of Sutton, and the\r\nheiress of Cokesey, about the middle of the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nSee Nash's History of Worcestershire, vol. ii. p. 217; and\r\nBlakeway's Sheriffs of Salop, p. 60.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Gules, a fess within a border engrailed ermine_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, William Joseph Acton, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLYTTLETON OF FRANKLEY, BARON LYTTLETON 1794; IRISH BARON 1776;\r\nBARONET 1618.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] The name is derived from a place in the Vale of\r\nEvesham, where the ancestors of this family in the female line were\r\nseated before the reign of Richard I. Frankley came from an heiress\r\nof that name in the reign of Henry III. In that of Henry V.\r\nElizabeth, heiress of Sir Thomas Lyttleton, of Frankley, married\r\nThomas Westcote of Westcote, in the county of Devon, Esquire, \"but\r\nthe old knight, her father, desirous to perpetuate his name, (and\r\nhis purpose failed not,) would not yield consent to the marriage but\r\nupon his son's-in-law assured promise that his son, enjoying his\r\nmother's inheritance, should also take her name, and continue it,\r\nwhich was justly performed.\" (Westcote's Devonshire, p. 306.)\r\n\r\nHagley, the principal seat, was purchased in 1564. Mr. John\r\nLyttleton, the head of this family, was implicated in Lord Essex's\r\nrising in 1600; but his son, Sir Thomas, was right loyal to the\r\nCrown in 1642.\r\n\r\nSee Leland's Itinerary in Coll.

No family in England is more connected with the\r\nhistory of our country than this noble race; few are more highly\r\nallied. The Marches of Wales appear to be the original seat;\r\nafterwards we find the Talbots in Shropshire, in Staffordshire,\r\n(where their estates were inherited from the Verdons in the time of\r\nthe Edwards,) and lastly in Yorkshire, at Sheffield, derived from\r\nthe great heiress of Neville Lord Furnival. This was the seat of the\r\nfirst seven Earls of Shrewsbury, of whom an excellent biographical\r\naccount will be found in Hunter's Hallamshire (p. 43). The manor of\r\nGrafton, formerly the estate of the Staffords, was granted by Henry\r\nVII. to Sir Gilbert Talbot in 1486; it afterwards became the seat of\r\na younger branch, who eventually, on the death of the eighth Earl,\r\nbecame Earls of Shrewsbury, from whom all the succeeding Earls, to\r\nthe decease of Bertram Arthur, 17th Earl of Shrewsbury, in 1856,\r\nwere descended. The present and 18th Earl, who is also the 3rd Earl\r\nTalbot, springs from the second marriage of Sir John Talbot of\r\nAlbrighton in Shropshire, and of Grafton, in this county, who died\r\nin 1550, and who was grandfather of the 9th and ancestor of the\r\nsucceeding Earls.\r\n\r\nYounger Branch.

In that of Henry VI. by the heiress of\r\nAllesley, the family became possessed of the manor of Lawford, which\r\nremained their residence till the murder of Sir Theodosius Boughton,\r\nBaronet, by his brother-in-law Mr. Donnellan, in 1781. After that\r\nevent, a younger branch succeeding to the estate and title, Lawford\r\nHall was pulled down, and the ninth Baronet, on inheriting the\r\nproperty of the Rouses of Rouse-Lench, in this county, assumed that\r\nname, and made it his seat and residence.\r\n\r\nSee Dugdale's Warwickshire, second ed., vol. i. p. 98; Nichols's\r\nLeicestershire, vol. iv. pt. i. p. 202; and Wotton's Baronetage,\r\nvol. ii. p. 220.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Sable, three crescents or_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Sir Charles Henry Rouse Boughton, 11th\r\nBaronet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYORKSHIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Knightly.+\r\n\r\n\r\nFITZWILLIAM OF WENTWORTH HOUSE; EARL FITZWILLIAM 1746; BARON of\r\nIRELAND 1620.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] William FitzGodric, who married Albreda de Lizours,\r\nLady of Sprotsborough, in this county, and who died before 1195, is\r\nthe remote ancestor of this ancient house. Their son, William\r\nFitzWilliam, was seated at Sprotsborough in the reign of Henry II.,\r\nand here the family continued till the extinction of the elder line,\r\nwhich ended in coheiresses in the reign of Henry VIII.\r\n\r\nThe rise of this branch of the family must be ascribed to Sir\r\nWilliam Fitzwilliam, Lord Justice, and afterwards Lord Deputy of\r\nIreland, in the reign of Elizabeth, whose grandson was created Baron\r\nFitzwilliam in 1620. In the year 1565, Hugh Fitzwilliam collected\r\nwhatever evidences could be found touching the descent of the\r\nfamily. This account, which is in the possession of Earl\r\nFitzwilliam, is the foundation of most of the histories of this\r\ngreat family, whose present Yorkshire property came from the\r\nWentworths through the coheiress of the Marquis of Rockingham in\r\n1744.

During the Civil Wars of the seventeenth century,\r\nthe Wyvills were distinguished by their loyalty and consequent\r\nsufferings in the royal cause. An elder line of this family, on whom\r\nthe Baronetcy, created in 1611, has descended, is said to be\r\nresident in Maryland, in the United States of America.\r\n\r\nSee Leland's Itinerary, vol. iv. pl. i.; Whitaker's Richmondshire,\r\nvol. i. p. 322; and Wotton's Baronetage, vol. i. p. 232.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Gules, three chevronels interlaced vaire, and a chief or_.\r\nThe arms are founded upon the coat of Fitz Hugh, and may be taken as\r\na proof of high antiquity.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Marmaduke Wyvill, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPEST OF BROUGHTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] The pedigree of this ancient family is traced to\r\nRoger, whom Dr. Whitaker calls \"Progenitor of this the oldest and\r\nmost distinguished of the Craven families now surviving. That this\r\nman was a Norman the name will not permit us to doubt; that he was a\r\ndependant of Roger of Poitou is extremely probable; that he was at\r\nall events possessed of Bracewell (in Craven) early in the reign of\r\nHenry I., is absolutely certain.\" Dr. Whitaker proceeds to remark on\r\nthe name of Tempest, which he says, \"whatever was its origin, seems\r\nto have been venerated by the family, as in the two next centuries,\r\nwhen local appellation became almost universal, they never chose to\r\npart with it.\" The elder line of the Tempests continued at Bracewell\r\ntill the time of Charles I., when Richard Tempest, the last\r\nrepresentative, pulled down the family house, and devised the estate\r\nto a distant relation. The house of Broughton descends directly from\r\nRoger, second son of Sir Peirs Tempest, which Roger married in the\r\nseventh of Henry IV.

The Castle, or Peel, was built in the reign of Henry\r\nVII. The Hamertons were engaged in the Northern Rebellion in 1537,\r\nand thereby Sir Stephen Hamerton lost his head, and his family the\r\nestate; which was restored to the male representative of the family,\r\nin the third year of Elizabeth, by a munificent settlement made by\r\nJohn Redman, who had become possessed of the property, and was\r\nrelated by marriage to the Hamertons.

The siege of Hull in 1643, when Sir\r\nJohn Hotham was Governor for the Parliament, and with his son was\r\ndiscovered holding correspondence with the Royalists, for which they\r\nboth suffered death, will ever render this family historical.\r\n\r\nSee Wotton's Baronetage, vol. i. p. 473; the Scrope and Grosvenor\r\nRoll, vol. ii. p. 306; and Oliver's Beverley, p. 509.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Barry of ten argent and azure, on a canton or a raven\r\nproper_.

Sir\r\nRobert Waterton, Master of the Horse to Henry IV., and John\r\nWaterton, who served King Henry V. at Agincourt in the same office,\r\nwere of this place; the last was succeeded by his brother Sir\r\nRobert, who was of Methley in this county, which he inherited with\r\nhis wife Cicely, the daughter and heir of Robert Fleming, of\r\nWoodhall in that parish, and where his tomb is still preserved. This\r\nSir Robert was Govenor of Pontefract Castle during the time that\r\nRichard II. was confined there. The present family descend from John\r\nWaterton, a younger son of this house, (the male line of the elder\r\nbranch being extinct,) who married Catherine de Burgh, heiress of\r\nWalton, in the year 1435, which has since continued the residence of\r\nthis ancient knightly lineage.\r\n\r\nSee Whitaker's Leeds, vol. i. p. 269; and the Scrope and Grosvenor\r\nRoll, vol. ii. p. 190, for a memoir of Hugh Waterton, Esq.; and the\r\nHistory of the Isle of Axholme by Archdeacon Stonehouse.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Barry of six ermine and gules, over all three crescents\r\nsable_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Edmund Waterton, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAIRFAX OF STEETON.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] \"The truly ancient family of Fairfax,\" as Camden\r\nstyles it, is supposed to be of Saxon origin, and to have been\r\nseated at Torcester in Northumberland at the period of the Conquest.\r\nIn 1205 (sixth of John,) Richard Fairfax, the first of the family\r\nproved by evidence, was possessed of the lands of Ascham, not far\r\nfrom the City of York. His grandson William purchased the Manor of\r\nWalton in the West Riding, which continued for near six hundred\r\nyears, till the extinction of the elder male line of the family in\r\nthe person of Charles Gregory Fairfax, tenth Viscount Fairfax of\r\nIreland, in 1772, the inheritance of his descendants. From a younger\r\nson of Richard Fairfax, of Walton, Chief Justice of England in the\r\nreign of Henry VI. the present family is descended, as well as\r\nFairfax of Denton, Baron Fairfax of Cameron in Scotland (1627,) who\r\nrepresents an elder line,* and who resides in the United States of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nSteeton was the gift of the Chief Justice to Sir Guy Fairfax, his\r\nthird son, the founder of this branch of the family, and here he\r\nerected a castle in 1477.\r\n\r\nSee Lodge's Peerage of Ireland, ed. 1754, vol. ii. p. 397.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Argent, three bars gemelles gules, surmounted by a lion\r\nrampant sable, crowned or_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Thomas Fairfax, Esq.\r\n\r\n  * He is descended from the _eldest_ son of Sir William Fairfax of\r\n    Steeton, who died in 1557.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTON OF GRANTLEY, BARON GRANTLEY 1782.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] The pedigree begins with Egbert Coigniers, whose son\r\nRoger was living in the ninth year of Edward II., and was father of\r\nanother Roger, who marrying the heiress of Norton of Norton, their\r\nson took that name; sixth in descent was Richard Norton, who joined\r\nwith the Earls of Northumberland and Westmerland in the Rebellion\r\nof the North in 1569, and thereby caused the destruction of almost\r\nevery branch of his family. He was attainted in the twelfth of\r\nElizabeth, and died in exile in Spain. The present family descend\r\nfrom Sir Fletcher Norton, Speaker of the House of Commons, descended\r\nfrom Edmund Norton of Clowcroft, third son of old Richard Norton,\r\nwhich Edmund had taken no part in the Northern Rebellion.\r\n\r\nAn elder branch, also descended from the third son of Sir Richard,\r\nand believed to be now extinct, was of Sawley near Ripon, from the\r\nperiod of Charles I.\r\n\r\nSee Brydges's Collins, vol. vii. p. 546; Whitaker's Richmondshire,\r\nvol. ii. p. 182; and \"Memorials of the Rebellion of 1569.\"\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Azure, a maunch ermine, over all a bend gules_.

Some writers have\r\nfancifully ascribed to it an Italian origin, but it probably had its\r\nrise at Silkston, in this county. It certainly flourished in those\r\nparts in the thirteenth century; and in the middle of the fourteenth\r\ncentury we find (1358) Margaret Savile Prioress of Kirklees.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Edward III. the family divided itself into two main\r\nbranches, in the person of two brothers, John of Tankersley and\r\nHenry of Bradley. The senior branch acquired its greatest renown in\r\nthe person of George first Marquess of Halifax, a title which became\r\nextinct in 1700. The junior branch was of Copley and Methley, and,\r\nhaving produced one of the most learned men of our country, Sir\r\nHenry Savile, the Provost of Eton, is now represented by the Earl of\r\nMexborough.\r\n\r\nSee Dugdale's Baronage, ii. p. 462; Whitaker's Leeds, vol. i. pp.\r\n272, 310; Archdall's ed. of Lodge's Peerage of Ireland, vol. iii. p.\r\n156; Hunter's Antiquarian Notices of Lupset, 1851; and the Savile\r\nCorrespondence, edited for the Camden Society by W.

Of this family, it has been\r\nsaid, was Gower the Poet, but Sir Harris Nicolas in his memoir of\r\nGower could not trace the connection. Leland remarks, \"The House of\r\nGower the Poet yet remayneth at Switenham (Stittenham) in Yorkshire,\r\nand divers of them syns have beene knightes.\" In the end of the\r\nseventeenth century the wealth of this family was greatly increased\r\nby marriage with the heiress of Leveson, of Trentham, in\r\nStaffordshire, and also in the year 1785 by the marriage of the\r\nMarquess of Stafford with Elizabeth, daughter and heir of William\r\neighteenth Earl of Sutherland, mother of the present Duke.\r\n\r\nYounger Branches.

The present house descended from Sir John Pilkington,\r\nsecond son of Robert Pilkington, and brother of the unfortunate Sir\r\nThomas. His son Robert is stated to have been of Bradley, in this\r\ncounty. He died in 1429, and was the ancestor of Sir Arthur the\r\nfirst Baronet.\r\n\r\nYounger Branches. Pilkington of Park-Lane Hall, in this county,\r\ndescended from the second son of Robert Pilkington, of Bradley, who\r\nwas living in 1540; and Pilkington of Tore, in the county of\r\nWestmeath, descended from Sir Robert, younger brother of Sir John\r\nPilkington, ancestor of the house of Bradley.\r\n\r\nSee Wotton's Baronetage, vol. iv. p. 338; Hunter's South Yorkshire,\r\nvol. ii. p. 394; Burke's Landed Gentry; and \"The Grand Juries of the\r\nCounty of Westmeath,\" vol. ii. p. 254.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_A cross patonce voided gules_.

The senior\r\nline of this house terminated with Thomas Burton, who died unmarried\r\nin 1730, and whose sister carried the Longner estate to the Lingen\r\nfamily, who have assumed the name of Burton (see p. 198.) Thomas,\r\nfifth son of Thomas Burton, of Longner, is the ancestor of the\r\npresent family, and of the Marquess of Conyngham (elder brother of\r\nthe late Lord Londesborough). He went to Ireland in the reign of\r\nJames I., and died there in 1665. His great-grandson married the\r\nheiress of Conyngham.

Rawdon\r\nremained the family residence till early in the seventeenth century,\r\nwhen Sir George Rawdon, the then head of the house, removed into the\r\nNorth of Ireland, and was seated at Moira, in the county of Down,\r\nwhere the family principally lived till the match with the heiress\r\nof Hastings in 1752.\r\n\r\nSee Whitaker's Leeds, vol. i. p. 171; Brydges's Collins, vol. iv. p.\r\n606; Wotton's Baronetage, vol. iii. p. 467; and Archdall's Lodge,\r\nvol. iii. p. 95.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Argent, a fess between three pheons sable_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Henry Weysford Charles Plantagenet Rawdon\r\nHastings, 4th Marquess of Hastings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTANCRED OF BOROUGH-BRIDGE, BARONET 1662.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] At a very early date, and probably not long after the\r\nConquest, the ancestors of this family were seated at\r\nBorough-Bridge, which appears to have been ever since one of the\r\nresidences of the house of Tancred.\r\n\r\nSee Wotton's Baronetage, vol. iii. p. 387.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Argent, a chevron between three escallops gules_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Sir Thomas Tancred, 7th Baronet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEYNELL OF NORTH KILVINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] Hilton in Cleveland appears to have been the original\r\nseat of this ancient family; here it was resident in the twelfth\r\ncentury, and here it remained till the middle of the sixteenth, when\r\nAnthony Meynell, the immediate ancestor of the present family,\r\nremoved by purchase to North Kilvington, which has since continued\r\nthe residence of his descendants.\r\n\r\nSee Graves's History of Cleveland; and Burke's Landed Gentry.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Azure, three bars gemelles and a chief or_. This is the\r\nancient coat of Meysnill or Meynell of Dalby-on-the-Woulds in\r\nLeicestershire, and was borne by Trevor de Menyll in the reign of\r\nHenry III., and also by Sir Nicholas de Meynell in that of Edward\r\nII., with the exception of two instead of three bars gemelles.\r\n(Rolls of the dates.)\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Thomas Meynell, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANNE OF BURGH-WALLIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] Of this family Mr. Hunter has remarked, that \"it is a\r\nsingle instance of the male line being maintained in its ancient\r\nport and rank out of all the gentry of the Deanery of Doncaster,\r\nsummoned to appear before the Heralds in 1584.\" The pedigree begins\r\nwith Sir William de Anne, Constable of the Castle of Tickhill in the\r\ntime of Edward II. He married the coheiress of Haringel, from whom\r\ncame the manor of Frickley, sold in the latter part of the\r\neighteenth century. Burgh-Wallis came from the heiress of Fenton in\r\nthe reign of Elizabeth. Mr. Hunter observes, \"The Annes, like too\r\nmany other families, have not been careful of preserving their\r\nancient evidences, and theirs was not one of the muniment rooms to\r\nwhich our diligent antiquary Dodsworth had access.\"\r\n\r\nSee Hunter's South Yorkshire, vol. ii. pp. 148, 485.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Gules, three stag's heads cabossed argent attired or_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, George Anne, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLISTER OF GISBURN, BARON RIBBLESDALE 1797.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] The pedigree is traced to the sixth of Edward II.,\r\nwhen John de Lister was resident at Derby. He married the daughter\r\nand heiress of John de Bolton, Bowbearer of Bollond, and thus became\r\nconnected with this county. The elder line was of Mydhope, or\r\nMiddop, and afterwards, in the reign of Philip and Mary, of Thornton\r\nin Craven, and became extinct in 1667. The present family is sprung\r\nfrom Thomas, second son of Christopher Lister, who lived in the time\r\nof Edward IV. The Listers were of Gisburn early in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, the ancient seat of Arnoldsbiggin in that manor being their\r\nseat for many generations. Lyster, of Rowton, in Shropshire, is\r\nsupposed to be a branch of this family, though there is no evidence\r\nof the fact; Rowton has been in possession of the Lysters since\r\n1482.\r\n\r\nSee Whitaker's Craven, ed. 1812, pp. 38, 103; and Brydges's Collins,\r\nvol. viii. p. 584; and for Rowton, Blakeway's Sheriffs of Salop, p.\r\n144.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Ermine, on a fess sable three mullets or_. Lyster of Rowton\r\nbears the mullets _argent_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Thomas Lister, 3rd Baron Ribblesdale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLASCELLES OF HAREWOOD; EARL OF HAREWOOD 1812 BARON 1796.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] A family of ancient standing in this county,\r\ndescended from John de Lascelles, of Hinderskelfe, now called Castle\r\nHoward, in the wapentake of Bulmer, in the North riding, living in\r\nthe ninth year of Edward II. For seven generations immediately\r\nfollowing they were called \"_Lascelles alias Jackson_.\" About the\r\nreign of Henry VI. they removed to Gawthorpe, also in the North\r\nriding, and afterwards to Stank and Northallerton; Harewood was\r\npurchased about 1721.\r\n\r\nSee Whitaker's Leeds, vol. i. p. 169; and Brydges's Collins, vol.\r\nviii. p. 508.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Sable, a cross flory within a border or_. This coat, without\r\nthe border, was borne by Monsieur Lascelles de Worthorpe, as appears\r\nby the Roll of the reign of Edward III. Monsieur Rafe de Lascelles\r\nbore at the same period, Argent, three chaplets of roses _vermaux,_\r\nwith a border engrailed sable.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Henry Thynne Lascelles, fourth Earl of\r\nHarewood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOMBWELL OF WOMBWELL, BARONET 1778.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] There was a family who took the local name of\r\nWombwell from that manor in the thirteenth century, but this cannot\r\nwith certainty be connected with it. The pedigree therefore\r\ncommences with Hugh Wombwell of Wombwell, son of Henry Lowell de\r\nWombwell, living in the reign of Edward III. The elder branch of\r\nthis family became extinct in the male line on the death of William\r\nWombwell of Wombwell, Esq. in 1733. Part of the estate from whence\r\nthe name is derived belongs to the present family, who represent a\r\njunior line, descended from George Wombwell, of Leeds, who died in\r\n1682, by purchase of the coheirs.\r\n\r\nSee Hunter's South Yorkshire, vol. ii. p. 124.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Gules, a bend between six unicorn's heads cooped argent_;\r\nand so borne in the sixth of Henry IV.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, Sir George Orby Wombwell, 4th Baronet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPALMES OF NABURN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] There appears no reason to doubt the antiquity of\r\nthis family, said to be descended from Manfred Palmes, living in the\r\nreign of Stephen, and seated at Naburn since the year 1226, by a\r\nmatch with the heiress of Watterville.\r\n\r\nSee Burke's Landed Gentry.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Gules, three fleurs-de-lis argent, a chief vaire_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, the Rev, William Lindsay Palmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROUNDELL OF SCREVEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] On the authority of Whitaker we learn that Screven\r\nhas been in this family since the early part of the fifteenth\r\ncentury; the first recorded ancestor being John Roundell, of\r\nScreven, living in the third of Henry VI.\r\n\r\nSee Whitaker's Craven, ed. 1812, p. 76.\r\n\r\nARMS.--_Or, a fess gules between three olive-branches vert_.\r\n\r\nPresent Representative, the Rev.

NICHOLS AND SONS, PRINTERS.\r\n  PARLIAMENT STREET.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Transcriber's Notes:\r\n\r\n    The following misprints have been corrected:\r\n\r\n    [in this county of B ckingham] ->\r\n      [in this county of Buckingham]\r\n\r\n    [directly to the Couquest] ->\r\n      [directly to the Conquest]\r\n\r\n    [This family wrs originally] ->\r\n      [This family was originally]\r\n\r\n    [Torr-Abbey was purchasd] ->\r\n      [Torr-Abbey was purchased]\r\n\r\n    [EARL WALDEGRVE 1729] ->\r\n      [EARL WALDEGRAVE 1729]\r\n\r\n    [Cornewwall of Delbury.] ->\r\n      [Cornewall of Delbury.]\r\n\r\n    See under \"COMPTON OF COMPTON WYNIATE\":\r\n    [the seventeenth eentury.] ->\r\n      [the seventeenth century.]\r\n\r\n    [extinct in the last centnry.] ->\r\n      [extinct in the last century.]\r\n\r\n    [who assumed the loca name] ->\r\n      [who assumed the local name]\r\n\r\n    [G. H. M'Gill's account], this may seem a misprint but\r\n      [M'Gill] is an existing name.\r\n\r\n    As the text below \"DIGBY OF MILTON\" suggests, the placename\r\n    [Milton] should be [Tilton]. Confirmation for this has been\r\n    found in \"the Leicestershire Historian\", vol. 2, no. 8 (the\r\n    article \"The Tilton Family in America and its Link with Tilton\r\n    on the Hill\" written by Peter D. A. Blakesley), page 7:\r\n    \"... the family of Digby, lords of the manor of Tilton from the\r\n    twelfth century until the seventeenth century, when the manor\r\n    was sold.\"\r\n    [DIGBY OF MILTON, BARON] ->\r\n      [DIGBY OF TILTON, BARON]\r\n\r\n    Another misprint for [Tilton] has been found in the \"Index\":\r\n    [Digby of Minton, 76] ->\r\n      [Digby of Tilton, 76]\r\n\r\n    [Bedingfeld of Oxburgh, 156] ->\r\n      [Bedingfeld of Oxburgh, 150]\r\n\r\n    [Leigh of East Hall, 21] ->\r\n      [Legh of East Hall, 21]\r\n\r\n    [Onslow of West Clandon, 52] ->\r\n      [Onslow of West Clandon, 251]\r\n\r\n    Two misprints in this one:\r\n    [Wake of Courtenhall, 138] ->\r\n      [Wake of Courteenhall, 158]\r\n\r\n    The author used asterixes to indicate notes.\r\n    Unfortunately 3 asterixes lack an explanation.\r\n    They are located at:\r\n      [Leicestershire, iv. pt. 2. p. 519.*]\r\n      [Leicestershire, iii. pt. 2, p. 1009*]\r\n      [ii. pt. i. p. *261;]\r\n\r\n    The word [coheiress] also occurs with the notation [co-heiress].\r\n    Both notations have been maintained.\r\n\r\n    The plain text file of this ebook uses underscores to indicate\r\n    italic text and plus signs to indicate a bold Gothic typeface.\r\n\r\n    Each family description starts with an illustration representing\r\n    their arms. In the plain text file these have been replaced with\r\n    [Illustration].\r\n\r\n    A few cases of punctuation errors were corrected, but are\r\n    not mentioned here.\r\n  ]",
