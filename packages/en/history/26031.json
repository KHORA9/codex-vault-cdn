Every circumstance connected with them\r\nhas been carefully examined, and whatever statements are now advanced\r\ncan be borne out by documentary evidence. The career of Saumarez was a\r\nlong and eventful one: he entered the Navy while the nation was at\r\npeace; he subsequently served during the American War of\r\nindependence, and throughout the late continental war, in both of\r\nwhich he was in more engagements with the enemy than any other\r\nofficer. He was the last of the heroes of the 12th of April 1782.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nLORD DE SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n   Genealogy of the family of Saumarez.--Curious Record.--Branches\r\n   of the late family.--Marriage of the late Lord de Saumarez.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdmiral the Right Honourable James Lord de Saumarez, of Guernsey, was\r\nborn, on the 11th March 1757, in the parish of St. Peter-Port, the\r\nprincipal town of that romantic island. The family, whose original\r\nname was _De Sausmarez_, is of Norman extraction, and of great\r\nantiquity in the island of Guernsey, where their lineage can be traced\r\nalmost to the Norman conquest.\r\n\r\nTheir remote ancestor received from the Dukes of Normandy a fief of\r\nthe district of Jerbourg, and was appointed hereditary captain (or\r\nchatelain) of the castle of that name, which lies within the limits of\r\nthe fief, and is situated in the parish of St. Martin.\r\n\r\nAmong the records of the island, we find the following interesting\r\nparticulars:--In the twenty-seventh year of the reign of Edward the\r\nFirst, at a court of chief pleas held at Guernsey, in the presence of\r\nthe judges of assize, Matthew de Sausmarez made homage for his fief;\r\nwhich appears to have been acknowledged by an act of Edward the Second\r\nin the year 1313: and in the reign of Edward the Third, in the year\r\n1331, an application was made by Matthew de Sausmarez for a\r\nconfirmation of his rights and prerogatives, as formerly enjoyed by\r\nhis ancestors.\r\n\r\nOn receipt of this petition, his Majesty sent an order to John de\r\nRoches, guardian of the Channel islands, to make a perquisition\r\nthereon; authorising him to give to it his royal assent if not found\r\nto be prejudicial to the rights of the Crown or the privileges of the\r\ninhabitants, who had, by consent of his Majesty's father, fortified\r\nthe castle of Jerbourg as a place of retreat and protection, as also\r\nfor the security of their effects in case of invasion by the enemy.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of his Majesty's order, the guardian appointed twelve of\r\nthe most respectable inhabitants of the island to be examined before\r\nthe bailiff or chief magistrate, who declared upon oath that the\r\npredecessors of Matthew de Sausmarez held that appointment from the\r\nCrown, with sundry appurtenances and privileges, which, in\r\nconsideration of their services as hereditary keepers of the castle,\r\nhad always been, and ought to be, inseparable from the fief of\r\nJerbourg; and they further deposed, that these were not in any respect\r\ndetrimental to the prerogative of the Crown, or injurious to the\r\nrights of the inhabitants, who still retained the advantage and\r\nprivilege of retreating into the castle, with their effects, in every\r\nemergency.\r\n\r\nThe following curious and interesting fact, as attached to this\r\nancient fief, has been also recorded in a Guernsey periodical:\r\n\"Whenever the lord had occasion to go to Jersey, his tenants were\r\nobliged to convey him thither, for which they received a gratuity of\r\n_three sous_, or a dinner; but they were not obliged to bring him\r\nback.\" And this exemption may be thus explained:--The lord, or captain\r\nof Jerbourg, in those days held a fief in Jersey, called by the same\r\nname, which no longer belongs to the De Saumarez family; but formerly,\r\nwhen it was possessed by the same individual, the same rights and\r\nprivileges were attached, so that when the affairs of the lord called\r\nhim to Jersey, he was conducted to that island by his Guernsey\r\ntenants, and brought back by those of Jersey.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed certain, that, during many years after the Norman\r\nconquest, several gentlemen possessed estates in both islands, more or\r\nless considerable in one than in the other. The fief of Jerbourg\r\nremained in the family of De Sausmarez till about the year 1555, when\r\nit became the property of Mr. John Andros, in right of Judith de\r\nSausmarez: but it has since reverted to the descendants of the old\r\nfamily, and belonged to Thomas de Sausmarez, his Majesty's late\r\nattorney-general in the island of Guernsey, who died lately at a very\r\nadvanced age,--the father of twenty-eight children!\r\n\r\nThe genealogy of the family between the year 1481, and the birth of\r\nthe grandfather of the late Lord de Saumarez on the 4th June 1635,\r\nwill be found in the Addenda, as also that of the subsequent members\r\nof the family who are not mentioned here; but, in proceeding, we\r\ncannot pass over the names of Captains Philip and Thomas Saumarez,\r\nuncles of the late lord, who were two of the bravest and most\r\nmeritorious officers of their time. The former, who was first\r\nlieutenant with Commodore Anson, afterwards commanded the Nottingham,\r\nsixty-four, captured the French seventy-four, Mars, and was killed in\r\naction 1747;[1] and the latter, when in command of the Antelope, of\r\nfifty guns, captured the French sixty-four, Belliqueux, in the\r\nfollowing extraordinary manner:\r\n\r\n   [1] See Addenda.\r\n\r\nIn the month of November 1758, Captain Saumarez was stationed in the\r\nBristol Channel for the protection of the trade, and, the wind blowing\r\nstrong from the westward, had anchored his ship, the Antelope, of\r\nfifty guns and three hundred and fifty men, in King Road; and there\r\nbeing little probability of the appearance of an enemy under such\r\ncircumstances, he had repaired to Bristol to partake of the\r\nhospitality of his friends in that prosperous city. While sitting at\r\ndinner, an express came from Barnstaple to inform him that a large\r\nship, supposed to be an enemy, had anchored under Lundy Island.\r\n\r\nCaptain Saumarez immediately repaired on board his ship, weighed\r\nanchor, and, notwithstanding the contrary wind and fresh gale, he beat\r\ndown the channel, and in the morning saw her at anchor off Ilfracombe.\r\nOn discovering the Antelope, the enemy weighed and stood towards her,\r\nand, on coming near, hoisted French colours and seemed prepared to\r\nengage. As soon as the Antelope came within gun-shot, she opened her\r\nfire, when the Frenchman immediately hauled down his colours without\r\nreturning a shot. Captain Saumarez now sent his boat with the first\r\nlieutenant to know if she had surrendered; but finding that the boat\r\ndid not return, he bore down under her stern, and asked if they had\r\nstruck. The answer was in the affirmative, and she was immediately\r\ntaken possession of. She proved to be the Belliqueux, of sixty-four\r\nguns and five hundred men.\r\n\r\nWhen the captain came on board the Antelope, and found that he had\r\nsurrendered to a ship so much inferior in force, both in men and\r\nweight of metal, his chagrin and mortification knew no bounds. He\r\nexclaimed that he had been deceived, and actually proposed to Captain\r\nSaumarez that he should allow him to return to his ship, and that he\r\nwould fight him fairly; to which the English captain replied that he\r\nmust keep possession now; that he had obtained it, but he had no\r\nobjection to his going back to France and getting another ship of the\r\nsame kind to try the fortune of war. He conducted his prize back to\r\nKing Road, and returned to Bristol with his French guest to enjoy the\r\nhospitality and hearty welcome of his friends, after an absence of\r\nonly eighteen hours!\r\n\r\nMatthew de Saumarez, father of Lord de Saumarez, being brought up to\r\nthe medical profession, arrived at considerable practice and high\r\nrespectability. He was remarkable for his urbanity of manners and\r\nhospitality, particularly to strangers. He married, first, Susannah,\r\ndaughter of Thomas Dumaresq, Esq. of Jersey, and by her had Susannah\r\n(an only child), who married Henry Brock, Esq. of Guernsey: his second\r\nwife was Carteret, daughter of James Le Marchant, Esq. of Guernsey,\r\nand by her he had a numerous family, who are brothers and sisters of\r\nthe late lord.[2]\r\n\r\n   [2] See Addenda.\r\n\r\nThe family of De Sausmarez, a branch of which changed the spelling of\r\nthe name to Saumarez about the year 1700, was not only one of the most\r\nancient and respectable, but the members of it successively held the\r\nhighest situations, and were connected with the first families\r\nresiding in the island of Guernsey, which has always been\r\ndistinguished for its loyalty and patriotism: indeed, it has not only\r\nproduced several of our bravest and greatest warriors, but its\r\ninhabitants have ever manifested themselves to be proof against every\r\nattempt to seduce them from their allegiance. The opinions which have\r\nbeen entertained unfavourable to this fact,--arising no doubt from the\r\nproximity of the island to the coast of France, and the general use of\r\nthe French language, but, most of all, from its having at one time\r\nbeen infested by adventurers,--are totally without foundation.\r\n\r\nHaving been many years stationed at this island, we have witnessed the\r\nloyalty and intrepidity of the natives: and could give several\r\ninstances where the Guernsey pilot was the _first_ to board the enemy.\r\n\r\nLord de Saumarez was married at Guernsey, on the 27th October 1788, to\r\nMartha, only daughter and heiress of Thomas Le Marchant, Esq. by\r\nmarriage with Miss Mary Dobree, two of the most ancient and\r\nrespectable families in the island. This marriage was the consequence\r\nof a long and mutual attachment: it need scarcely be added, that it\r\ncompleted the happiness of both. They became the parents of eight\r\nchildren, whose biography will be found in the Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n1767 to 1778.\r\n\r\n   Commencement of his Career.--His Education.--Visit of the Duke\r\n   of Gloucester to Guernsey.--Saumarez decides for the Navy.--Is\r\n   put on the Soleby's books.--School at London.--Embarks in the\r\n   Montreal.--Winchelsea, Pembroke, Levant.--Smyrna.--Returns\r\n   home.--Passes for Lieutenant.--Embarks in the Bristol.--Proposal\r\n   to leave the Navy.--Attack on Fort Sullivan.--Gallant\r\n   Conduct.--Is made Lieutenant.--Bristol, Chatham, Lady\r\n   Parker.--Commands the Spitfire.--Rhode Island.--Many\r\n   Engagements.--War with France.--Appearance of the French Fleet\r\n   under D'Estaing.--Spitfire burnt.--Appearance of Lord Howe.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe illustrious admiral, of whose ancestors a biographical sketch has\r\nbeen briefly given in the preceding chapter, and in the Addenda to\r\nthis work, and whose glorious career is the subject of this record,\r\npassed from the first rudiments of learning, under a dame, to the more\r\nmanly tuition of Elizabeth College, in Guernsey, where his brother,\r\nfifteen months his senior, was receiving his education.\r\n\r\nAlthough he always said that his brother was a much better scholar in\r\nboth Latin and Greek than himself, his taste for poetry, and his\r\ndiscrimination in that refined branch of literature, must have\r\nappeared at a very early age, as, when he was only seven or eight\r\nyears old, he surprised his mother by reciting to her several lines\r\nfrom the first pages of Milton's Paradise Lost, which he had learnt of\r\nhis own accord,--a foretaste of the gratification which he derived\r\nthrough life in reading that noble poem. His mother was so delighted\r\nwith this unexpected discovery of his taste, that she could not\r\nforbear making it known to her friends; especially to a literary\r\ngentleman of her acquaintance, who sent young Saumarez a present of\r\nthe Golden Verses of Pythagoras, which he also committed to memory,\r\nand retained throughout his life.\r\n\r\nBut the great sensibility of his heart was most apparent in his\r\nattachment to all his relations: their pleasures and their pains were\r\nalways _his_; and it is therefore not surprising that he was a\r\nfavourite with them all. In those days, Guernsey was, as it were, a\r\nlarge family; and the society of the upper classes was linked in a\r\nsmall, but a select and happy, circle, interested in each other's\r\nwelfare. The communication with England not being, as now, kept up by\r\nregular packets, the arrival of a stranger was an event of some\r\nimportance, and mostly occurred through the visits of the king's ships\r\ngoing on foreign stations, which put into Guernsey for wines and\r\nother stores: on these occasions the captains and officers were\r\nconstant guests at the hospitable mansion of our hero's father, and it\r\nwas usually the province of young Saumarez to look out for and report\r\ntheir appearance.\r\n\r\nIn July 1767, this little community was surprised by an occurrence\r\nwhich to this day is related among the events of \"olden times,\" as\r\nhaving made a great, and certainly a lasting impression. His royal\r\nhighness the Duke of Gloucester, on his return from a tour in France,\r\nanchored in Guernsey roads. At two in the morning, the hostess of the\r\nonly inn in the town was awakened by a call that the Duke of\r\nGloucester had landed, and was coming there: not supposing this\r\npossible, she for a long time refused to rise; but, being at\r\nlength convinced, she directed the party to the house of the\r\nlieutenant-governor, who was as incredulous as the good woman of the\r\nShip Inn.\r\n\r\nAt last he appeared at the window in his dressing-gown and _bonnet de\r\nnuit_, and finding whom he was called upon to receive, he exclaimed,\r\nin the trepidation of the moment,--\"My house is not fit for the duke;\r\ngo to my friend, Doctor Saumarez.\" There at last his royal highness\r\nfound entrance, and a hearty welcome; but it may be conjectured that\r\nno little surprise and bustle spread through the house at the\r\nunexpected arrival at such an hour of the illustrious guest. The blue\r\ndamask room was, however, soon prepared, with other apartments for the\r\naides-de camp, Sir Henry Clinton and another.\r\n\r\nYoung Saumarez and his brother were sent off, as soon as the sun rose,\r\nto inform their uncle the attorney-general, who resided some distance\r\nfrom the town, that the royal visitor had arrived. On their return the\r\nstreets were decorated with crowns, festoons, and garlands of flowers,\r\nwhich had risen as from the wand of a magician; the bells were\r\nringing, the populace were in holiday suits, and the whole effect was\r\nso animated, that the more splendid scenes of after-life never erased\r\nit from the mind of Saumarez.\r\n\r\nThe duke, on rising, was surprised at the quick display of loyalty he\r\nbeheld, and expressed himself much gratified at the proofs he received\r\nof respect and attachment which these faithful islanders evinced in\r\nhis person towards the king and the royal family. His royal highness\r\ncondescended to honour a ball in the evening; and often did young\r\nSaumarez hear his aunt (a sister of his mother, married to Major\r\nBrabazon of the 65th regiment,) relate her having opened the ball in a\r\nminuet with his royal highness.\r\n\r\nYoung Saumarez had long and constantly cherished a decided\r\npredilection for the navy. Accustomed as he had been from childhood to\r\nhear of the fame which his valiant uncles, Captains Philip and Thomas\r\nSaumarez, had acquired, his mind was early inspired with a desire to\r\ntread in their path, and to acquire for himself a name which might\r\nemulate theirs. His eldest brother was already in the navy; but his\r\nfather having six sons, when he found that James had evinced such a\r\ndesire for the sea, and having connexions in the service, probably\r\nconsidered that he could not place another more advantageously than in\r\na profession which had already afforded an honourable and glorious\r\ncareer to two of his family. Accordingly he accepted the offer of\r\nCaptain Lucius O'Bryen, of his majesty's ship Soleby, who entered his\r\nname on the books of that ship on the 20th September 1767 as\r\nvolunteer, where it remained until the 3rd of June 1770, having been\r\nthere two years and nine months. During this time, however, he never\r\njoined the ship, but was for a part of it at a school in the vicinity\r\nof London, which had been recommended to his father by a naval friend,\r\nwho appears to have been ill qualified to make the selection, if we\r\nmay judge from the amusing account which Saumarez gave in after-life\r\nof his acquirements in that seminary. Fortunately, as he said, when he\r\nhad been there ten months, his father being in London, sent for him,\r\nand to his great joy took him home, and with this portion of education\r\nhe was launched into the world; as a few months after he went to\r\nPortsmouth to join the Montreal, Captain Alms, who had been a friend\r\nof his uncles, and who had visited his father at Guernsey.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of August 1769, the ship sailed for the Mediterranean.\r\nGreat pains were taken by the captain to improve the talents of young\r\nSaumarez, which soon became apparent: but the commodore being obliged\r\nto return home on account of ill health, he placed him in the\r\nWinchelsea; and we find that he went on board the Pembroke, bearing\r\nthe broad pendant of Commodore Proby, and commanded by Captain Durell,\r\nwho was a relative of the family, on the 14th August 1770, and joined\r\nthe former ship on the 28th September following.\r\n\r\nNature happily had endowed young Saumarez with talents, and qualities\r\nof mind and heart, which in a great measure repaired the want of a\r\nregular and more enlarged education: a sound judgment and quick\r\nsensibility soon led him to perceive his deficiency in acquired\r\nknowledge; and he was inspired with a laudable ambition, to remedy it\r\nby every exertion the feeble means within his reach could accomplish.\r\nWhen, indeed, it is considered that only a few volumes of the\r\nSpectator and Idler, with some stray volumes of the Roman History,\r\ncomposed his little library, it may justly be inferred that it was no\r\nordinary capacity or moderate application which could form a character\r\nsuch as was manifested by him.\r\n\r\nFrigates, in those days, had neither chaplains nor schoolmasters; and\r\nthe \"young gentlemen,\" when off duty, were left to spend their time as\r\nthey thought fit. The midshipmen of the present day can have but a\r\nfaint idea of the hardships and privations of a naval aspirant's life\r\nat the period Saumarez entered the service. Biscuits with insects, and\r\ntainted meat, was the usual fare when at sea at their mess-table; and\r\nnone would have thought of procuring such _luxuries_ as are now\r\nindispensable _necessaries_ to their successors in the service. While\r\nthere is great cause to rejoice in the change which has taken place,\r\nit should not prevent the expression of just and well-founded regret\r\nthat the amelioration has spread to the opposite extreme; the placing\r\na son in the navy being now a heavy tax instead of a relief, which we\r\nknow is felt severely by old naval officers on half-pay, who naturally\r\nwish to employ a son in the service to which they belong.\r\n\r\nWith grateful remembrance, Saumarez has often been heard to say, that,\r\non his departure from home, his affectionate father put a purse\r\ncontaining fifteen guineas in his hand; observing that, as he knew he\r\nhad a large family, he trusted that he would use it with economy, but\r\nthat when he wanted more he might draw on his banker. So strictly,\r\nhowever, did he fulfil this recommendation, that his father said, the\r\nsight of his drafts gave him pleasure.\r\n\r\nHis first journal is of the Winchelsea, Captain Samuel Cranston\r\nGoodall, and commences on the 8th November 1770, at which time he was\r\nfirst rated a midshipman: he remained in that ship until the 14th\r\nFebruary 1772. During these seventeen months he gained a valuable\r\nfriend in Captain Goodall, whose regard he preserved to the end of his\r\nlife. Saumarez had constant access to his cabin: he allowed him to\r\nwrite there, and make extracts from the best authors in his\r\npossession, which was of great service in improving his acquaintance\r\nwith modern literature. This ship had been cruising in the\r\nMediterranean, and visited most of the interesting ports there; and,\r\nin February 1772, the Winchelsea was ordered to England,--an account\r\njoyfully hailed by all on board, but by none more sincerely than by\r\nMr. Saumarez, whose heart panted to see his dearest friends. What,\r\nthen, must have been his feelings, on the arrival of the Levant to\r\nrelieve the Winchelsea, when he was sent for by Captain Goodall, and\r\napprised that Captain Thompson would receive him?--and as it was of\r\nimportance that he should finish his time before going home, he\r\nstrongly recommended his stay, especially as it was his father's wish.\r\nAlthough it was as if a sword had pierced his heart, he calmly\r\nsubmitted to the decision, and he saw the worthy Captain Goodall and\r\nhis messmates depart without a murmur.\r\n\r\nThis self-denial was not wholly unrewarded. The Levant was a larger\r\nship, affording much better accommodation to the midshipmen; and Mr.\r\nSaumarez, having been nearly three years at sea, became of some\r\nconsequence with his messmates. The date of his joining the Levant was\r\nthe 15th February 1772, having been discharged on the preceding day\r\nfrom the Winchelsea. He soon formed a close friendship with Mr. Samuel\r\nThompson, the captain's son; which continued unshaken till the death\r\nof the latter in 1782.\r\n\r\nThe British merchants having petitioned for a ship of war to be\r\nstationed in the Mediterranean for the protection of the trade, the\r\nLevant was ordered on that service, and for fourteen months remained\r\nin that inactive position, which young Saumarez used to say he\r\nconsidered a blank in his existence. Having no books to relieve the\r\nspirits, no letters to cheer the heart, life wasted away without\r\nprofit or satisfaction. There must, however, have been a few bright\r\ndays; for he often mentioned with pleasure the hospitality of the\r\nEnglish families settled in Smyrna, of which he occasionally partook\r\nwhen Captain Thompson allowed it. This was the more frequent on\r\naccount of his thorough knowledge of the French language, which was\r\nthe means of procuring him attentions rendered doubly acceptable by\r\nthe dulness of that anchorage: such were the advantages he derived\r\nfrom his familiarity with that language, that he never failed to\r\nrecommend the study of it to all his young _proteges_ before going to\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of May 1773, the Levant was at length released, and sailed\r\nfor Gibraltar; from which place she proceeded to Port Mahon, to be\r\nrepaired. On the 28th of May 1774, she resumed her old station in\r\nSmyrna harbour, (in consequence of an insurrection, in which several\r\nChristians had been massacred, owing to the destruction of the Russian\r\nfleet in the Bay of Chisma, on the contiguous coast,) having been away\r\nprecisely one year. She again left that station, on the 19th of\r\nSeptember, for Gibraltar; and finally for England in March 1775, on\r\nthe 29th of which month she arrived at Spithead. On the 14th of the\r\nfollowing April, Mr. Saumarez was discharged from the Levant; and had\r\nat length the long-wished-for happiness of seeing again his native\r\nland, and the friends from whom he had been for more than five years\r\nseparated.\r\n\r\nThe Levant, being paid off, was recommissioned by the Honourable\r\nCaptain Murray, who used every persuasion to induce Mr. Saumarez to\r\nremain in the ship; but, after an absence of five years, he was too\r\nanxious to spend some time with his family, to accede to his proposal,\r\nand the moment he was at liberty he set off for Guernsey.\r\n\r\nTaking into account the time his name had been on the books of the\r\nSolebay, he had now served more than the required six years of\r\nservice: and as the regulations for age were at that time not strictly\r\nenforced, after a few weeks of rest he went to London to pass his\r\nexamination for lieutenant; but owing to the commissioners being on\r\ntheir annual visits to the dock-yards, and their return being\r\nprotracted, two months elapsed before the object was accomplished.\r\nThis enabled him again to return to his friends, but he was not then\r\npermitted long to enjoy their society.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1775, on the breaking out of the war with the American\r\ncolonies, Commodore Sir Peter Parker being appointed to the command of\r\na squadron, with his broad pendant on board the Bristol, of fifty\r\nguns, Mr. Saumarez, then eighteen years of age, was ordered to join\r\nthat ship, through the recommendation of Admiral Keppel, who, having\r\nbeen the friend and contemporary of his uncles, ever evinced an\r\ninterest in his advancement. After an interview with Sir Peter in\r\nLondon, he embarked, on the 9th of October, at Sheerness, whence the\r\nBristol proceeded to the Nore at the end of November. After passing a\r\nshort time at Spithead and Plymouth, which they left on the 21st of\r\nDecember, the squadron sailed for Cork, the last rendezvous of the\r\nexpedition destined for South Carolina. This consisted of six\r\nfrigates, two bombs, and two hundred transports, containing seven\r\nregiments of infantry and two companies of artillery, under the\r\ncommand of that distinguished nobleman, the Earl Cornwallis, and the\r\nHonourable Brigadier-general Vaughan. These two chiefs, with their\r\naides-de-camp, Lord Chewton and Captain Eustace, were embarked on\r\nboard the Bristol: they sailed about the middle of January 1776.\r\n\r\nOn the passage out, which was remarkable for stormy weather, and for\r\nthe consequent dispersion of the convoy, the activity and zeal of\r\nyoung Saumarez not only attracted the attention, but gained the esteem\r\nof the noble earl; who, by offering to make him his aide-de-camp and\r\ntake him by the hand, had nearly persuaded him to leave the naval\r\nservice, and enter the army, offering him a commission in the 33rd,\r\nhis own regiment. We have heard him relate, that, after he had more\r\nthan half consented, he went below and told his messmates, who\r\nimmediately jeered him so much about \"turning soldier,\" that he\r\nreturned to the quarter-deck and gave a positive refusal to the earl,\r\nwho could not help expressing his disappointment and chagrin on the\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that he would have highly distinguished himself\r\nin the army, or wherever he was placed; but, happily for the nation,\r\nand for the honour of the profession which he had first chosen, he was\r\ndestined to display his bravery and splendid talents in a sphere where\r\nthere happened to be a much greater range for them, than if he had\r\nfollowed the fortunes of the noble earl in the other honourable\r\nservice. Many years after, when Saumarez's career had proved the\r\nwisdom of his decision, he met Lord Cornwallis at dinner at Lord\r\nSpencer's, then first lord of the admiralty; who, on hearing this\r\nanecdote, observed, \"Lord Cornwallis would have deprived the naval\r\nservice of one of its best officers.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bristol arrived off Cape Fear early in May, where they found\r\nGeneral Clinton; and, having repaired their damages, reached\r\nCharlestown in the beginning of June. The troops were landed on the\r\nisland, at a low, sandy spot, in the midst of a heavy surf, and the\r\nguns of the Bristol and the Experiment were put on board the Harcourt\r\nEast-indiaman, to enable them to get over the bar.\r\n\r\nOne of the transports, called the Friendship, having been fitted as a\r\nship of war to be taken into the service, was commissioned by\r\nLieutenant Charles Hope, first of the Bristol, an excellent officer,\r\nand he selected Sir James Barclay and Mr. Saumarez to be his officers;\r\nbut, after a few days, he prevailed on Captain Hope to allow him to\r\nreturn to the Bristol, which he did only two days previously to the\r\nattack on Fort Sullivan, which, after passing the bar, it became\r\nnecessary to silence and take possession of. This fortress was\r\nconsidered the key of the harbour, and the fortifications of it were\r\nconstructed with great skill: the works being formed of cabbage-tree,\r\na kind of wood peculiarly calculated, by its porous and elastic\r\nquality, to resist the effects of shot; and, from its not being liable\r\nto splinter, the troops in the batteries were secured from what is\r\ndeemed one of the principal means of destruction; while the Bristol's\r\ncrew were fully exposed to the fatal effects of the enemy's fire. The\r\nguns being taken on board on the 28th of June 1776, at 8 A.M. the\r\nsquadron began the attack by a furious and incessant cannonade, which\r\ncontinued with little intermission until nine o'clock at night. Never\r\ndid British valour shine more conspicuously, nor did our ships in an\r\nengagement of the same nature experience so serious an encounter: the\r\nsquadron could not approach within grape-shot of the enemy, and\r\ntherefore could not clear the batteries; and the spring of the\r\nBristol's cable being cut by the shot, she swung so as to get\r\ndreadfully raked. Mr. Saumarez was employed in replacing this spring\r\nthree times in the Mercury's boat, assisted by the captain of that\r\ntransport.\r\n\r\nThe brave Captain Morris, after receiving a number of wounds, with a\r\nnoble constancy disdained to quit his duty; until, his arm being shot\r\noff, he was carried below in a condition which did not afford any\r\nprobability of recovery. At one time, the quarter-deck of the Bristol\r\nwas cleared of every one except the commodore, who stood on the\r\npoop-ladder alone; a spectacle of intrepidity and firmness which has\r\nbeen seldom equalled, never exceeded. It is said, that Mr. Saumarez\r\nseeing him in this situation, requested him to come down; when he\r\nreplied with a smile, \"What! you want to get rid of me, do ye?\" while\r\nhe well knew that the reverse was the fact.\r\n\r\nThe loss sustained by the squadron in general, and by the Bristol in\r\nparticular, in an action unexampled in point of duration, and in which\r\nit was finally repulsed, was very great: she had alone one hundred and\r\neleven killed and wounded, including her gallant captain and several\r\nother officers.\r\n\r\nDuring this severe conflict, Mr. Saumarez had a very narrow escape: at\r\nthe moment he was pointing a gun on the lower-deck, of which he had\r\nthe command, a shot from the fort entered the port-hole, struck the\r\ngun, and killed seven out of eight men who were stationed to work it.\r\nSome time afterwards, being called on deck to execute certain orders\r\nrespecting the replacing the spring on the cable, he was standing\r\nclose to Mr. Darley, a midshipman, for whom he had the greatest\r\nregard, when a shot took off the young man's head and covered Mr.\r\nSaumarez with his blood.\r\n\r\nCaptain Morris, after being carried below, lingered contrary to\r\nexpectation, and hopes were formed that he would survive; when,\r\nunfortunately, his attendant being overcome with sleep, it is supposed\r\nthe captain's bandages gave way, and, not having strength to awake\r\nhim, he was found in the morning bathed in his blood. His dissolution\r\nbecoming inevitable, one of the officers asked him if he had any\r\ndirection to give with respect to his family; to which he nobly\r\nreplied, \"None! I leave them to the Providence of God, and the\r\ngenerosity of my country,\" and soon after expired. This engagement\r\nlasted thirteen hours: it was the first in which Mr. Saumarez had been\r\npresent; and, after the very many in which he was subsequently\r\nengaged, he has been heard to declare it to have been one of the most\r\nsevere he ever witnessed. Captain Scott, of the Experiment, lost his\r\narm; and there were several death-vacancies for lieutenants.\r\n\r\nMr. Saumarez's conduct during the whole of this obstinate and bloody\r\ncontest was deemed so especially meritorious, that the commodore\r\nexpressed his highest approbation of it in the warmest and most\r\nflattering terms, and soon after the battle he promoted him to the\r\nrank of lieutenant. The following is a copy of his first acting\r\ncommission:\r\n\r\n   \"By Sir Peter Parker, Commander-in-chief of a squadron of his\r\n   Majesty's ships to be employed on a particular service.\r\n\r\n   \"Whereas I think it necessary for the good of his Majesty's\r\n   service to have an Acting-lieutenant on board his Majesty's ship\r\n   the Bristol, you are hereby required and directed to take upon\r\n   you the office of Acting-lieutenant of his Majesty's ship\r\n   Bristol; strictly charging and commanding all the officers and\r\n   company of the said ship to behave themselves jointly, and\r\n   severally, in their respective employments, with all due respect\r\n   and obedience unto you their said LIEUTENANT; and you are\r\n   likewise to observe and execute the GENERAL PRINTED\r\n   INSTRUCTIONS, and such orders and directions as you shall from\r\n   time to time receive from your captain, or any other your\r\n   superior officer, for his Majesty's service.\r\n\r\n   \"For which this shall be your Order. Dated on board his\r\n   Majesty's ship Bristol, in Five-fathom Hole, off Charlestown,\r\n   the 11th day of July 1776.\r\n   P. PARKER\r\n\r\n   \"To Mr. James Saumarez, hereby\r\n   appointed to act as Lieutenant on\r\n   board his Majesty's ship Bristol,\r\n   until further orders.\r\n   \"By command of the Commodore.\r\n   JOHN READ.\"\r\n\r\nIn this ship Acting-lieutenant Saumarez remained until the 23rd\r\nSeptember; serving often with the army on shore, and on all occasions\r\ntaking a distinguished part. He was actively employed in the boats of\r\nthe Bristol on every landing that took place, from the first\r\ndisembarkation of the troops in Gravesend Bay, to the landing at\r\nRochelle from Frog's-neck. Lord Howe then commanded in person on this\r\nexpedition, and hoisted his flag in the Carysfort, the gallant Captain\r\nFanshawe. His lordship appointed Mr. Saumarez his aide-de-camp, and\r\nselected him to convey General Clinton, commanding the troops, to the\r\nvicinity of Rochelle, when he had the satisfaction of receiving the\r\nthanks of his lordship for his zealous exertions. All the boats were\r\nthen ordered to join their respective ships off New York; an order,\r\nit may be supposed, not unwelcome after an absence of several weeks,\r\nduring which officers and men had been subject to all the privations\r\nconsequent on such a service, sleeping in boats, and scarcely having\r\nany change of clothing.\r\n\r\nSaumarez was afterwards on duty up the North River, and had the honour\r\nof conveying Lord Cornwallis and his staff on board his boat in the\r\nfirst landing in the Jerseys; and on several occasions he was actively\r\nuseful to his lordship, who repeatedly acknowledged his services.\r\nBeing employed in the disembarkation of troops newly arrived, he\r\ndiscovered that his brother's regiment, the twenty-third Welsh (now\r\nRoyal Welsh) Fusileers, was one of them; and soon after he had the\r\nhappiness of meeting him, who, on his part, was not less agreeably\r\nsurprised at the welcome and unexpected encounter.\r\n\r\nBeing at head-quarters when Fort Washington surrendered, the garrison,\r\nconsisting of two thousand seven hundred men, having laid down their\r\narms, Lieutenant Saumarez was the bearer of the tidings to the\r\nBristol; but they appeared so incredible, that it was some time before\r\nSir Peter Parker could be persuaded of their authenticity.\r\n\r\nRear-admiral Lord Shuldham, having on the 6th September, shifted his\r\nflag to the Bristol, Lieutenant Saumarez followed his commander, who\r\nthen hoisted his broad pendant in the Chatham. He was therefore\r\nremoved by Lord Viscount Howe, vice-admiral of the white, and\r\ncommander-in-chief of all his Majesty's ships and vessels in North\r\nAmerica, to the Chatham, as fifth lieutenant \"for the time being.\" In\r\nthis situation Lieutenant Saumarez so often and so particularly\r\ndistinguished himself in the boats, and in command of the Lady\r\nParker schooner, tender to the Unicorn, Captain Ford, that, on\r\nthe 17th February 1778, he was appointed lieutenant commanding\r\nthe Spitfire, a schooner-rigged galley, by special direction of\r\nthe commander-in-chief, as will appear by the following order:\r\n\r\n   \"By Commodore Hotham, on board the Preston.\r\n\r\n   \"The Viscount Howe having directed that you shall command the\r\n   Spitfire galley, in the room of Lieutenant Scott; you are hereby\r\n   directed to repair on board the said galley, and take the\r\n   command of her accordingly, using the utmost despatch in\r\n   preparing and fitting her for a passage to Rhode Island.\r\n\r\n   \"Given on board the Preston,\r\n   off New York, 17th February 1778.\r\n   W. HOTHAM.\r\n\r\n   \"To Lieut. Saumarez, hereby\r\n   appointed to command\r\n   H.M. galley, the Spitfire.\r\n   \"By command.\r\n   TITUS LEWIS.\"\r\n\r\nOur young hero, who had been far less actively employed than he\r\nwished, had now obtained almost the height of his ambition,--in other\r\nwords, a situation where he could have an opportunity of displaying\r\nhis talents and intrepidity. He found his new vessel in the king's\r\nyard; and, having taken charge from her former commander, proceeded\r\nto fit out with surprising diligence. On the 23rd February he received\r\ntwenty-three seamen from the Preston; and on the 27th a sergeant and\r\neleven marines completed his complement of thirty-seven men, including\r\nhimself and the carpenter; when he immediately weighed and made sail.\r\nIt soon after blew a gale, but he succeeded in reaching the Brothers,\r\nwhere he anchored, and found H.M.S. Sphinx, and some traders: the\r\nnext morning he weighed, and falling in with H.M.S. Falcon and\r\nconvoy, they proceeded on their voyage. On the 4th of March strong\r\ngales obliged the convoy to put into Huntingdon Bay, where they were\r\ndetained by stormy weather till the 13th of March. On the 15th the\r\nconvoy reached Oyster-pond Bay, and on the 16th anchored off Fort\r\nIsland, in company with the Eagle, Nonsuch, Apollo, Mermaid, Unicorn,\r\nAriel, Maidstone, Grampus, and Stromboli; and here their active\r\noperations began. On the 28th of March an enemy's frigate was chased\r\nand run on shore in the Narraganset Passage, when Lieutenant Saumarez,\r\ntogether with the boats of the squadron, went to destroy her, she\r\nbeing protected by a battery on shore; the Spitfire was anchored about\r\nfour hundred yards from this battery in twelve feet water, and, having\r\ngot her long-bow gun to bear, engaged it while the boats boarded and\r\nset fire to the frigate: this occupied more than an hour, during\r\nwhich time the battery was silenced, but a brisk fire of musketry was\r\nkept up by the rebels; and the service being performed, the galley was\r\ntowed out with little damage, five men being wounded: at nine she\r\nanchored in safety off Newton's Point. Soon after this a gale came on;\r\nthe galley drove towards the rocks, and it was supposed she must be\r\nlost; but Lieutenant Saumarez cut his cable, and by a masterly act of\r\nseamanship saved his vessel, and gained the admiration of the whole\r\nsquadron. During this period, Lieutenant Saumarez was under the orders\r\nof Commodore Griffith, of the Nonsuch, senior officer of his Majesty's\r\nships and vessels at Rhode Island; and it will appear by the following\r\nsecret order, that he was kept at the most important point in advance.\r\n\r\n   (Secret.)\r\n   \"By Walter Griffith, Esq. Commander of a division of his\r\n   Majesty's ships and vessels at Rhode Island.\r\n\r\n   \"The employment of the galley under your command being necessary\r\n   in the Seakonnet Channel, with the intention to intercept any\r\n   armed vessels fitted by the rebels for putting to sea from the\r\n   harbours or creeks communicating therewith; but more\r\n   particularly to defeat any attempts they may propose for making\r\n   a descent in force, or attacking the post occupied by the king's\r\n   troops on the eastern shore of Rhode Island; you are therefore\r\n   to proceed to the aforesaid channel, and put yourself under the\r\n   command of the superior officer there, for those purposes\r\n   accordingly: but you are, nevertheless, at liberty to move the\r\n   galley (under the orders of the commanding officer there) from\r\n   time to time, to prevent the enemy from being able to ascertain\r\n   the position thereof, either for executing any meditated insult\r\n   on the galley, or to pass you unobserved during the night;\r\n   taking care, however, to keep as much as may be within such\r\n   limits, as will fully enable you to effect the principal object\r\n   of your appointment as aforesaid.\r\n\r\n   \"It will become requisite for this end, to have your boats (or\r\n   other better-appointed craft, with which you can in future be\r\n   supplied), advanced at seasonable lines, both for the earlier\r\n   discovery of any ships or vessels attempting to pass your\r\n   station in the night, and preventing any other advantages\r\n   attempted by the enemy under cover thereof.\r\n\r\n   \"The crews of the boats so directed should be prudently cautious\r\n   in boarding vessels of inconsiderable appearance, that they may\r\n   not be exposed to suffer by the treacherous practice of the\r\n   enemy in different modes to blow up and destroy your men; but a\r\n   suitable discretion will be no less requisite on your part,\r\n   that, in warning them of these hazards, they are not induced to\r\n   become remiss in their exertions in the essential services.\r\n\r\n   \"If the enemy should attempt to pass your station with any ship\r\n   of apparent force, great attention will be requisite that you\r\n   may not be misled by such not improbable expeditions to draw you\r\n   from your station, and thereby facilitate the means to succeed\r\n   with less risk in a meditated descent on the eastern shore of\r\n   the island; which is to be at all times the object of your chief\r\n   care to resist and oppose, by endeavouring to destroy the boats\r\n   of the enemy employed on that occasion, or otherwise to prevent\r\n   the further use of them in the attempt.\r\n\r\n   \"It will therefore be incumbent on you, in conjunction with\r\n   other armed vessels stationed with you in Seakonnet Channel, to\r\n   intercept the said armed vessels (if possible) before they have\r\n   advanced below your first anchoring station, and to keep secret\r\n   such directions as the senior officer at the said anchorage may\r\n   propose to adopt for that intent.\r\n\r\n   \"You are to continue on this service until further orders; and I\r\n   am to recommend your attention, that a careful watch is kept in\r\n   the galley at all times, conformable to the tenour of the\r\n   printed instructions given in that respect; and that every other\r\n   precaution is taken to guard against the attempts of the rebel\r\n   for the annoyance of the galley, wherein it is to be observed of\r\n   all such enterprises, that those which are the least suspected\r\n   are ever the most likely to be attended with success.\r\n\r\n   \"Given on board H.M.S. Nonsuch,\r\n   at Rhode Island, 21st May 1778.\r\n   S.W. GRIFFITH.\"\r\n\r\n   \"To Lieut. Saumarez, &c.\"\r\n\r\nIt should be mentioned here, that Rhode Island was taken possession of\r\nby his Majesty's forces under General Clinton and Sir Peter Parker on\r\nthe 9th December 1776; and some description of it is necessary to show\r\nthe arduous as well as perilous nature of the service on which our\r\nyoung hero was now employed. This island takes its name from the\r\nprovince, and lies in Narraganset Bay: it is fifteen miles in length\r\nfrom north to south, and three miles and a half broad; the north end\r\nis only three miles from Bristol, to which there is a ferry. The\r\nSeakonnet Passage separates it from the main on the north-west side,\r\nand the islands of Conanicut and Prudence lie in the passage on the\r\nsouth-east side, the town of Newport being in the south-east part of\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\nThe Seakonnet Passage was in consequence of the above order allotted\r\nto the Spitfire. Lieutenant Saumarez was now under the orders of\r\nCaptain Graeme, and proceeded to his station: it appears from his\r\njournal, now in our possession, that he was constantly on the alert,\r\nand almost daily skirmishing with the enemy. On the 24th he had to\r\nsustain the attack of three armed boats which came off from Point\r\nJudith, and had nearly decoyed them on board; but they found their\r\nmistake in time to escape after a good drubbing. On the same evening\r\nhe joined a detachment of five hundred men, which, under cover of the\r\nFlora, had landed above Bristol and burnt one hundred and twenty-five\r\nbatteaux-plats, an armed galley, and a privateer of fourteen guns,\r\nbesides destroying the greatest part of the town. On the 30th April a\r\nfiring was heard in the direction of the Taunton: the Spitfire\r\nimmediately weighed, and ran over to the enemy's shore, where\r\nLieutenant Saumarez opposed his vessel to a field-piece, which\r\nreturned his fire without doing any injury for a considerable time;\r\nthis was meant as a diversion to enable the 54th regiment to attack\r\nunobserved, which in the mean time landed up the Taunton, destroyed\r\neight sawmills and several flat-boats, and came off by the assistance\r\nof the Spitfire with inconsiderable loss.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of May the Spitfire weighed, and was beating against the\r\nwind to obtain her station, when, by the vessel missing stays, she got\r\naground on Sandy Hook. On this, the enemy immediately brought down a\r\ngun, but without effect. An anchor was carried out; the vessel was\r\nhove off without damage, and reached Fogland Battery, off which she\r\nanchored, and the next day reached her former station.\r\n\r\nIt will be needless to notice every occasion wherein the Spitfire was\r\nengaged with the enemy, which, while Lieutenant Saumarez commanded\r\nher, was no less than forty-seven times! but we shall proceed to the\r\nperiod when his operations in that vessel were drawing to a close. The\r\nAmericans, who had publicly declared their independence on the 4th\r\nJuly 1776, had concluded a treaty with the French on the 13th March\r\n1778, which was considered by the British government as a declaration\r\nof war; and the French ambassador being directed to withdraw, the\r\nfollowing orders were issued to the squadron at Rhode Island by\r\nCommodore John Brisbane, who had now taken the command:\r\n\r\n   \"By Captain John Brisbane, Captain of H.M.S. Flora, and senior\r\n   officer of his Majesty's ships and vessels at Newport, Rhode\r\n   Island.\r\n\r\n   \"In pursuance of an order from the Lord Viscount Howe,\r\n   vice-admiral of the white, and commander-in-chief of his\r\n   Majesty's ships and vessels employed on a particular service,\r\n   you are hereby required and directed to MAKE WAR UPON, take, or\r\n   destroy any part of the French squadron lately arrived on the\r\n   coasts of this continent, as well as other ships of war of that\r\n   nation appearing on the coasts of North America, to the utmost\r\n   of your ability, until further orders, keeping this secret.\r\n\r\n   Dated on board H.M.S. Flora, at Newport, Rhode Island, 26th\r\n   July 1778.\r\n   (Signed)\r\n   J. BRISBANE.\r\n\r\n   \"To Lieutenant Saumarez, commanding\r\n   the Spitfire, galley.\"\r\n\r\nThis order was transmitted with an enclosure, designated \"Copy of a\r\nparagraph of a letter received from Lord Viscount Howe, dated off\r\nSandy Hook, 19th July 1778.\"\r\n\r\n   \"As there is not a sufficient naval force for the defence of\r\n   Rhode Island, and none can be sent while the French squadron, at\r\n   anchor off Sandy Hook, continues so much superior to that under\r\n   my command, it may not be unseasonable to remind you that you\r\n   are at liberty to apply the force under your direction, by\r\n   landing of guns and men for the service of the batteries;\r\n   dismantling, and even destroying the ships, to strengthen the\r\n   defences of the post in the most effectual manner, in case of an\r\n   attack upon the post, more especially when no longer in prospect\r\n   of rendering better assistance under the same circumstances, or\r\n   preventing the capture of the ships.\r\n\r\n   \"Every captain or commander is therefore directed to attend to\r\n   the foregoing paragraph, and act from circumstances, in the best\r\n   and most effectual manner possible for the defence of the post,\r\n   and ship or vessel under his command, so as to answer the\r\n   intention of his lordship. Dated on board H.M.S. Flora,\r\n   Newport Harbour, 27th July 1778.\r\n\r\n   \"To Lieutenant Saumarez, commanding\r\n   H.M. galley Spitfire.\"\r\n\r\nThe French, who had secretly been assisting the Americans, and had\r\nlong been preparing for war, sent a powerful fleet from France, which\r\narrived, and anchored off Sandy Hook, while Lord Howe was within the\r\nharbour with a very inferior force, but could not be attacked: they\r\ntherefore bent their course to reduce Rhode Island. On the 29th of\r\nJuly they were discovered; and, on the 4th of August, two ships of the\r\nline and two frigates entered the passage, where the Kingfisher sloop,\r\nthe Alarm and Spitfire, galleys, were stationed; and it being no\r\nlonger possible to prevent them from falling into the hands of the\r\nenemy, their stores, guns, and crews were landed, and the vessels set\r\non fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n1778 to 1782.\r\n\r\n     Serves ashore.--Returns to England in the\r\n     Leviathan.--Providential escape from shipwreck.--Visits\r\n     Guernsey.--Joins the Victory.--A journey to London.--Joins the\r\n     Fortitude.--Battle off the Dogger Bank.--Anecdotes of Admiral\r\n     Parker.--Mr. Saumarez promoted to the rank of Master and\r\n     Commander.--Appointed to the Tisiphone.--Sails for the West\r\n     Indies with Admiral Kempenfelt.--Action with Comte de\r\n     Guichen.--Captures a French ship of thirty-six guns.--Is\r\n     despatched to Sir Samuel Hood.--Arrives at Barbadoes.--Escapes\r\n     from two French men-of-war.--Passes through an intricate\r\n     channel.--Joins Sir Samuel Hood.--Gallant conduct in cutting\r\n     out a vessel.--Tisiphone ordered home.--Fortunate exchange with\r\n     Captain Stanhope.--Takes command of the Russell.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the destruction of his little vessel, the Spitfire, Lieutenant\r\nSaumarez was attached to the division of sailors under Commodore\r\nBrisbane, to whom he became aide-de-camp. This division consisted of\r\nthe crews of the frigates and other vessels which had been destroyed,\r\non the following day in the southern passage, to prevent their falling\r\ninto the hands of the enemy. The vessels destroyed, in addition to\r\nthose mentioned in the last chapter, were, the Juno, Lark, Orpheus,\r\nand Flora of thirty-two guns, and the Cerberus of twenty-eight.\r\n\r\nThe artillery and stores had been in part landed, and mounted in\r\nvarious positions on the island; while the seamen and officers,\r\namounting to above a thousand men, were actively employed there during\r\nthe whole of the siege. Lieutenant Saumarez was stationed latterly in\r\ncommand of one of the advanced posts, and had several opportunities of\r\ndistinguishing himself in repulsing the repeated assaults of the\r\nenemy, and in attacking them in return.\r\n\r\nThe plans of the French for the reduction of Rhode Island having\r\nfailed, and their fleet having been dispersed in a storm, during which\r\nsome were disabled, and others captured, and finally the appearance of\r\nLord Howe with a reinforced but still inferior squadron, induced them\r\nto abandon the project, and, after refitting at Boston, to steer for\r\nthe West Indies.\r\n\r\nThe officers and seamen, being now no longer wanted, were ordered a\r\npassage home in the Leviathan of fifty guns, on board which ship\r\nLieutenant Saumarez embarked, in company with Captains Dalrymple,\r\nSmith, Hudson, Brisbane, Symons, and Graeme, whose ships had also been\r\ndestroyed. As she was approaching the English Channel, the Leviathan\r\nwas overtaken by a violent storm, and most providentially saved from\r\nshipwreck by the clearing up of a thick fog just in time to avoid the\r\ndanger, when they found the ship close to the Rocks of Scilly, near to\r\nthe spot where Sir Cloudesley Shovel was lost. This circumstance has\r\nbeen attributed to a strong northerly current, but it was probably\r\nfrom the position of these dangerous islands being inaccurately laid\r\ndown in the charts; it is indeed an extraordinary fact, that an error\r\nof no less than three leagues in their situation was first discovered\r\nby the Swedish surveyor, Nordenanker, about the commencement of last\r\nwar. The Leviathan, nevertheless, arrived safely at Portsmouth about\r\nthe beginning of the year 1779, when Lieutenant Saumarez had again an\r\nopportunity of visiting his family and friends in Guernsey.\r\n\r\nHe had, however, resided there but a short time, when he was appointed\r\nfirst lieutenant of the Edgar of seventy-four guns, then fitting at\r\nWoolwich for the broad pendant of Commodore Elliot. After receiving\r\nhis letter of appointment, he was obliged to wait some time for an\r\nopportunity to cross the channel; but at length availed himself of the\r\nAmbuscade, which touched at Guernsey. Having arrived at the Isle of\r\nWight, Captain Phipps, her commander, ascertained that the squadron\r\nunder Admiral Drake, to which he belonged, had sailed from Spithead;\r\ntherefore without touching at Portsmouth to land Lieutenant Saumarez,\r\nhe proceeded to join the Channel fleet, which he found twenty leagues\r\nto the westward of Scilly, having on the way retaken the Helena sloop\r\nof war; to command which Sir John Warren, then first lieutenant of the\r\nVictory, was appointed, and Mr. Saumarez was ordered in his stead to\r\njoin the Victory, then bearing the flag of Sir Charles Hardy, at whose\r\nrequest he was continued in that ship, where he was third lieutenant\r\nin seniority, but supernumerary on the books. Besides the\r\ncommander-in-chief of the Channel fleet, Rear-Admiral Kempenfelt, as\r\nfirst, and Captain Collings, as second captain, were both on board the\r\nVictory detached to cruise off Brest, commencing in June 1779, and\r\nreturning occasionally to port until May 31st, 1780. After the death\r\nof Sir Charles Hardy, which took place on the 9th May 1780, Admiral\r\nGeary, and then Sir Francis Drake, succeeded to the command, with\r\nCaptain Clayton as captain.\r\n\r\nThe Victory continued on the same service until the spring of 1781,\r\nwhen Admiral Hyde Parker hoisted his flag, and Mr. Saumarez now became\r\nfirst lieutenant. He had been so zealously attentive to his duty, that\r\nfor several months he never went on shore, till at length he yielded\r\nto the persuasion of his messmates. On arriving at Point Beach,\r\nPortsmouth, he was accosted by a person in French, who demanded the\r\nway to the admiral's house, and at the same time informed him that he\r\nhad just landed with the intelligence that Jersey had been attacked\r\nby the French. Mr. Saumarez immediately went with the messenger to\r\nthe admiral, who despatched him as a courier to town, and he returned\r\nin a remarkably short time with orders respecting it. In short, his\r\ndiligence and zeal were so manifest in every service on which he was\r\nemployed, that he soon gained the esteem and friendship of\r\nVice-admiral Hyde Parker, who, in June 1781, was appointed to the\r\ncommand in the North Seas, and shifted his flag into the Fortitude,\r\nCaptain Robertson. The squadron in those seas, when under command of\r\nCommodore Keith Stewart, was of inconsiderable strength, but had now\r\nrisen to a force of five ships of the line, besides one fifty, one\r\nforty-four, and three frigates. Notwithstanding the desire of Lord\r\nSandwich, then first lord of the admiralty, to provide for his own\r\nfriends, the admiral succeeded in carrying with him, from the Victory,\r\nLieutenants Waghorne and Saumarez. On the 3rd of June they sailed from\r\nSpithead to Sheerness, and, after refitting and touching at Leith,\r\nsailed to bring home the Baltic convoy from Elsineur, about the\r\nbeginning of July.\r\n\r\nThe squadron, which might have been made much stronger, consisted of\r\nthe Fortitude, seventy-four, Captain Robertson; the Princess Amelia,\r\neighty, Captain Macartney; the Berwick, seventy-four, Captain\r\nFergusson; the Bienfaisant, sixty-four, Captain Braithwaite; the\r\nBuffalo, sixty, Captain Truscott; the Preston, fifty, Captain Graeme;\r\nthe Dolphin, forty-four, Captain Blair; the Latona, thirty-eight, Sir\r\nHyde Parker (the admiral's son); the Belle Poule, thirty-six, Captain\r\nPatton; the Cleopatra, thirty-two, Captain Murray; and the Surprise,\r\ncutter, Lieutenant Rivett.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch by this time had declared war, and, being perfectly aware of\r\nthe force of Admiral Parker's squadron, sailed with a large convoy for\r\nthe Baltic, under command of Admiral Zoutman, whose squadron was one\r\nship of the line superior; it became, therefore, necessary to take the\r\nDolphin, of forty-four guns, into the line, although she had only\r\neighteen-pounders on the lower deck.\r\n\r\nBut before entering into the details of the action which took place on\r\nthe 5th of August 1781, it is proper to give some of the particulars\r\nof each squadron. That of Admiral Parker was totally unfit for the\r\nline of battle; the ships had been but a short time together, and had\r\nonly two or three times practised the usual manoeuvres of forming\r\nthe line, &c. The Fortitude was a small seventy-four, but well manned.\r\nThe Princess Amelia was an old eighty-gun ship, with reduced metal and\r\nmasts. The Berwick was a good ship, and, in addition to her metal, had\r\ntwo sixty-eight-pounder carronades on the poop; but next to her was\r\nthe Dolphin, forty-four, with only twenty twelve-pounders on the\r\nlower-deck, which could not be expected to make any impression on a\r\nsixty-four. The Buffalo was formerly the Captain, of seventy guns;\r\nbut, in the commencement of hostilities, not being thought efficient\r\nas a ship of war, she was fitted up as a mast-ship and her name\r\nchanged; but, probably for want of vessels, she was again equipped for\r\nwar with sixty guns, but only with eighteen-pounders on the lower\r\ndeck. The Preston was a good fifty-gun ship, with her proper metal,\r\ntwenty-four-pounders on the lower, and twelve-pounders on the upper\r\ndeck. The Bienfaisant had the metal on her lower deck reduced. The\r\nArtois, which afterwards joined the squadron, was the finest frigate\r\nthen known; had twenty-eight, eighteen-pounders on her main deck,\r\nwith, in addition to her complement of guns, heavy carronades on the\r\nquarter-deck and forecastle; she was manned with three hundred\r\nmen. The Latona was a fine thirty-eight gun frigate, with\r\neighteen-pounders; the Belle Poule and Tartar were excellent of their\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch squadron consisted of one seventy-four, one sixty-eight, one\r\nsixty-four, and five fifty-fours. In the action there were five\r\nfrigates, the other five having gone off with the convoy; the list of\r\nboth will be found in the Appendix to this volume, with that of the\r\nkilled and wounded.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch squadron and convoy, which were bound to the Baltic, were\r\ndiscovered at four o'clock in the morning about six leagues to\r\nleeward; and there being a fine commanding breeze and smooth water,\r\neverything was favourable, as well for detaching the convoy, which was\r\nimmediately done by signal to the Tartar, as for making dispositions\r\nto attack the enemy. The admiral seeing that they had their own port\r\n(the Texel) directly to leeward, and being doubtful that they would\r\nrun in there for shelter, or at least go nearer to the shore, made the\r\nsignal to chase at thirty-five minutes past four, which obliged every\r\nship to make sail instead of preparing for action with a superior\r\nenemy. At five, Admiral Zoutman hoisted Dutch colours, and his\r\nmen-of-war drew out from the convoy, which took their station under\r\nthe lee to await the event. At half-past five, the admiral made the\r\nTartar's signal to stay by, and part company with the convoy, which\r\nthen hauled their wind, made sail to the south-west, and was soon out\r\nof sight and danger.\r\n\r\nAt ten minutes past six, the signal for the line of battle abreast was\r\nmade, which allowed the headmost ships to take in small sails; and\r\nimmediately after another signal was given for the Dolphin and Preston\r\nto change stations; this was a serious mistake, as it led our squadron\r\nto believe that the admiral meant to engage the ship ahead of the\r\nDutch admiral, and not that of the latter, which was actually his\r\nintention. This unfortunately placed the Dolphin in opposition to one\r\nof the largest of the enemy's vessels; and while it left the rear-ship\r\n(the Bienfaisant) for some time without an opponent, the van-ship\r\nBerwick and the Dolphin had to engage three of the enemy.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the Dutch were regularly drawn up in a line of\r\nbattle ahead, on the larboard tack, the ships being about a cable's\r\nlength apart, and keeping a point from the wind, with their sails well\r\nproportioned to each other. They appeared in excellent order, their\r\nhammocks stowed, and marines drawn up on the poop.\r\n\r\nAt fifty-six minutes past seven, the signal for close action was made,\r\nand, to the astonishment of our squadron, the enemy never fired a\r\nshot, although they might have done considerable damage to our ships\r\nhad they opened their fire on them as they approached end on to them,\r\non their weather beam. Not a gun was fired on either side until within\r\nhalf-musket shot, when the red flag was hoisted on both ships. Up to\r\nthat moment all was silent, and it is scarcely possible to conceive a\r\nsilence more solemn and impressive! At the same instant, they saw the\r\nsignal go to the mast-head of Zoutman's ship. The dreadful silence was\r\nnow broken by the tremendous roar of cannon when within pistol-shot,\r\nand the battle raged with the utmost fury for three hours and forty\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nAt ten o'clock, the signal for close action which had been made, was\r\nrepeated. The Berwick, having forced the van-ship of the enemy to\r\nedge off, fell to leeward of the line, and was consequently obliged to\r\nmake sail, tack, and regain her station in support of the Dolphin,\r\nwhich had then two ships on her, and was also thrown to leeward. The\r\nadmiral, having now slackened the Dutch admiral's fire, passed ahead\r\nof the Buffalo, on which the ships astern closed up to the Buffalo;\r\nand the Berwick took the station ahead of the admiral. At thirty-five\r\nminutes past eleven, the ships became unmanageable; and, the Dutch\r\ndropping to leeward, the action ceased.\r\n\r\nBy some it has been affirmed that Admiral Parker should have renewed\r\nthe action: Lieutenant Saumarez says, it was certainly his intention\r\nto do so; but the state of his own ship, and the reports he received\r\nfrom others, rendered it quite impossible.[3]\r\n\r\n   [3] When the action had ceased, Sir Hyde Parker,\r\n   captain of the Latona and son of the admiral, bore down on the\r\n   Fortitude, and affectionately inquired for his brave parent, of\r\n   whose gallantry he had been an anxious eye-witness. The admiral,\r\n   with equal warmth, assured his son of his personal safety, and\r\n   spoke of his mortification at being unable, from the state of\r\n   his own ship, and from the reports he had received of the other\r\n   ships, to pursue the advantage he had gained, in the manner he\r\n   most ardently desired.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch convoy had about the middle of the conflict bore up for the\r\nTexel. The protection of them was no longer an object, and Admiral\r\nZoutman, as soon as he could possibly get his ships collected and put\r\nbefore the wind, made the best of his way into the port; but during\r\nthe night the Hollandia, Dutch seventy-four, was seen sunk in\r\ntwenty-two fathoms water, and her pendant was hauled down by Captain\r\nPatton, of the Belle Poule, and brought to the admiral. As no ship was\r\ntaken, both claimed the victory: but, the convoy being sent back into\r\nport and one ship sunk, should certainly decide it to Admiral Parker;\r\nand had the English admiral not inadvertently rendered his van too\r\nweak by the mistake in the signal which also extended his line beyond\r\ntheir rear, thereby rendering one ship for a time useless, he would\r\nhave obtained a decisive victory.\r\n\r\nWhile Admiral Zoutman must be admired for his cool intrepidity, it\r\nmust be admitted that he was much to blame in forbearing to avail\r\nhimself of the opportunity of attacking and disabling the approaching\r\nfleet, which he might have done with great effect. After the Fortitude\r\nhad been put into a condition to make sail, Lieutenant Saumarez was\r\nsent to conduct the Preston, one of the disabled ships, into port; her\r\ncommander, Captain Graeme, having lost his arm in the action. When\r\nAdmiral Parker arrived at the Nore, his Majesty paid the squadron a\r\nvisit; but the veteran commander, indignant at the conduct of\r\nministers, who, he conceived, ought to have reinforced his squadron\r\ninstead of allowing some fine ships to lie idle in port, received the\r\nKing with that rough _hauteur_ peculiar to himself, observing, \"I wish\r\nyour Majesty better ships and younger officers. As for myself, I am\r\nnow too old for the service.\"\r\n\r\nOn this occasion Lieut. Saumarez was presented to George III. The King\r\ninquired if he was related to the captains of the same name one of\r\nwhom had circumnavigated the globe with Anson, and who had fallen\r\ngloriously in the service of their country: the admiral replied in the\r\naffirmative, saying, \"Yes, please your Majesty; he is their nephew,\r\nand as brave and as good an officer as either of them.\"\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the bravery and skill he displayed in this action,\r\nLieut. Saumarez was promoted to the rank of commander, although only\r\nsecond lieutenant; the first being wounded early in the action, the\r\nduty had fallen on our hero: and he was immediately appointed to the\r\nTisiphone, a fire-ship constructed on a new plan, and armed with\r\ncarronades, which was then fitting at Sheerness; his commission as\r\n\"master and commander,\" bearing date for that ship, the 23rd August\r\n1781.\r\n\r\nWhen lieutenant of the Fortitude, with Admiral Sir Hyde Parker,--who,\r\nfrom his acerbity of temper, was distinguished from others of the same\r\nname by the sobriquet of \"Vinegar Parker,\"--the old admiral betrayed\r\nhis ill-humour by unwarrantably finding fault with him one morning\r\nwhen Mr. Saumarez commanded the watch; but soon after, probably to\r\nmake amends for such hasty and unguarded conduct towards an officer\r\nfor whom he had the greatest regard, he sent to invite him to dinner,\r\nan honour which the young lieutenant declined in terms sufficiently\r\nstrong to indicate that his feelings had been hurt. On this, the\r\nadmiral sent for him and exclaimed, \"What! can't you put up with the\r\nfractious disposition of an old man?\" The admiral, who could not bear\r\nto be, even for a day, at variance with Lieutenant Saumarez, would do\r\nanything to serve him; and, when he obtained the command on the East\r\nIndia station, offered to take him with him in the Cato, which sailed,\r\nand was supposed to have foundered off the Cape of Good Hope, as she\r\nwas never afterwards heard of; and he happily escaped sharing the fate\r\nof that gallant chief and unfortunate crew.\r\n\r\nThe Tisiphone having been fitted out at Sheerness, and the complement\r\nof men having been filled up by supernumeraries from the Conquestadore\r\nat the Nore, Captain Saumarez, by order from Admiral Roddam, placed\r\nhimself under the command of Captain Allen, of the Sceptre, on the 6th\r\nSeptember 1781, from whom he received the following order:\r\n\r\n   You are hereby required and directed to put yourself under my\r\n   command, and to follow all such orders and directions as you\r\n   shall from time to time receive from me for his Majesty's\r\n   service, and to hold yourself in constant readiness to sail at a\r\n   moment's warning; and in case of separation by any unavoidable\r\n   accident, you are to make the best of your way without loss of\r\n   time to Torbay, and put yourself under the command of Admiral\r\n   Darby.\r\n\r\n   (Mem.) In case of your parting company with his Majesty's ship\r\n   Sceptre, and falling in with any ships or vessels belonging to\r\n   France or French subjects, Spain or Spanish subjects, the States\r\n   General of the United Provinces, or to his Majesty's rebellious\r\n   subjects in the colonies of North America, that you can cope\r\n   with, you are to use your best endeavours to take, seize, sink,\r\n   burn, or destroy the same: giving me an account of your arrival\r\n   at Torbay, and of anything you may have so taken or destroyed.\r\n\r\n   Signed.\r\n   WM. ALLEN.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of these orders Captain Saumarez sailed from the Nore,\r\nand, arriving at Torbay on the 17th, found that Admiral Darby had\r\nsailed in the Britannia on the 15th, after having left orders for the\r\nTisiphone to cruise a week off the Lizard. Here he was directed to\r\nproceed for Plymouth, where he arrived on the 1st of October; and\r\nhaving received further orders to repair to Spithead without loss of\r\ntime, he arrived there on the 13th October, to fit for Channel\r\nservice. He now joined the fleet under Lord Howe, and, after a cruise\r\noff Brest, returned to Portsmouth on the 21st of November: his ship\r\nwas found to sail extremely well.\r\n\r\nCaptain Saumarez was now ordered to place himself under the command of\r\nAdmiral Kempenfelt, who, with a detachment of twelve sail of the\r\nline, was destined to intercept Count de Guichen, who had put to sea\r\nfrom Brest, after having returned from his last severe campaign. The\r\ncount had been ordered to use every exertion to refit and prepare the\r\nFrench fleet for sea, notwithstanding the lateness of the season. The\r\nobjects in view could be accomplished only by extreme diligence and\r\nthe most profound secrecy, as it was absolutely necessary to reinforce\r\nCount de Grasse, with both ships and troops in the West Indies, as\r\nalso M. Des Ornes and Admiral Suffrein in the East. It was evident\r\nthat De Grasse, after his hard service on the coast of North America\r\nduring the preceding campaign, must stand in need of a vast supply of\r\nnaval and military stores; and the service he was about to undertake\r\nin the West Indies would increase the want of provisions, and almost\r\nevery necessary of life and of warfare: neither was the demand for\r\nnaval and military stores in the East Indies less urgent. Accordingly,\r\na numerous convoy of transports, store-ships, and victuallers were\r\nprepared and equipped at the same time as the fleet, which was now\r\nextended to such a number of men-of-war as was considered sufficient\r\nfor the protection of the convoys until fairly out of reach. This part\r\nof the service, as well as the charge of the whole expedition, was, as\r\nwe have stated, confided to Count Guichen; and the command of the\r\nsquadron and fleet destined to the West Indies, to M. de Vaudreuil.\r\nThe Tisiphone was the look-out ship of the squadron, which sailed from\r\nSpithead at the end of November.\r\n\r\nAt day-break on the 12th December, Captain Saumarez, being the first\r\nto discover the enemy, made known his situation to the admiral; which\r\nwas, that the men-of-war were too far ahead and too much to leeward of\r\nthe convoy to afford any protection to it. The admiral, with that\r\ndecision and professional skill by which he was so eminently\r\ndistinguished, determined to profit by their situation, and boldly\r\npushed between the convoy and the greater part of the enemy's\r\nline-of-battle ships, and succeeded in capturing twenty sail. In this\r\naffair Captain Saumarez had a noble opportunity of distinguishing\r\nhimself, by attacking the ship of war, of thirty-six guns, which was\r\nbringing up the rear of the convoy, and capturing her after an action\r\nof twenty minutes.\r\n\r\nBesides those captured, many others had struck; but, the weather at\r\nthis time becoming thick and squally, the admiral discontinued the\r\nchase of those which had been cut off, and which made sail in every\r\ndirection, that he might collect his squadron before dark, many of his\r\nships being at a great distance astern with the prizes. At daylight\r\nnext morning, the enemy's ships of war, twenty-one sail of the line,\r\nwere seen formed to leeward; but their force was so much superior,\r\nthat the admiral did not think it advisable to risk an action. The\r\ncaptured ships consisted of twenty-one sail of transports, having on\r\nboard eleven thousand troops, besides their crews of seven thousand\r\nseamen; the greatest part of which were taken by this squadron, and\r\nthe Agamemnon, which picked up five or six more.\r\n\r\nIt was now evident that the force under Count Guichen, destined to\r\nassist Count de Grasse in the capture of the valuable island of\r\nJamaica; was much greater than had been supposed by the English\r\ngovernment; and, consequently, it became of the utmost importance to\r\ngive the earliest information of the approach of such a formidable\r\nenemy to Sir Samuel Hood. Accordingly, Captain Saumarez, whose gallant\r\nconduct and zeal had been so manifest, was selected for this service.\r\nHis men were returned to the Tisiphone from the captured ships; and he\r\nwas detached with orders to push past the French fleet, and make the\r\nbest of his way to Barbadoes, (see Appendix) where he arrived on the\r\n28th of January; and finding the Pegasus, Captain John Stanhope, he\r\ndelivered his despatches, and received the following orders from that\r\nofficer:\r\n\r\n   You are hereby required and directed to proceed (without a\r\n   moment's loss of time) to the island of Antigua, where, on your\r\n   arrival off English Harbour, you are to send a boat in for\r\n   intelligence respecting Sir Samuel Hood and the fleet under his\r\n   command; which having received from the senior officer in that\r\n   port, you will proceed in search of the commander-in-chief, and\r\n   deliver him the despatches you are charged with from\r\n   Rear-admiral Kempenfelt, as also those you will receive\r\n   herewith.\r\n\r\n   Given on board his Majesty's ship Pegasus,\r\n   Carlisle Bay, this 28th Jan. 1782.\r\n\r\n   (Mem.) I recommend that particular attention may be paid to\r\n   keep well to windward of the French islands.\r\n\r\n   Signed  JOHN STANHOPE.\r\n\r\n   To Captain Saumarez, H.M. fire-ship Tisiphone.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of these orders, Captain Saumarez sailed from Barbadoes\r\non the 28th of January. In the mean time, the Comte de Grasse, who had\r\nbeen beating to windward for some days with the intention of attacking\r\nBarbadoes, but without gaining ground, had abandoned his plan, and\r\nbore away for St. Kitts. On his arrival there, he landed eight\r\nthousand men, and took possession of greater part of the island:\r\nGeneral Frazer, with a small party of six hundred men, was obliged to\r\nretire to Brimstone Hill Fort.\r\n\r\nSir Samuel Hood, notwithstanding the superiority of the enemy,\r\n(twenty-nine sail of the line,) resolved on a sudden and unusually\r\nbold manoeuvre, namely, to sail and attack the enemy's fleet at\r\nanchor. It was for this purpose that he had put to sea with twenty-two\r\nsail of the line, and proceeded to Antigua, where he took in\r\nprovisions, and embarked the twenty-eighth and two companies of the\r\nthirteenth regiment, under command of General Prescott.\r\n\r\nCaptain Saumarez, according to the orders he had received, proceeded\r\nfor Antigua, and keeping \"well to windward,\" as he had been directed\r\nto do, fell in with the Triumphante and Terrible, two French\r\nline-of-battle ships, of the squadron which had been attacked by\r\nAdmiral Kempenfelt on the 12th December, and which had been detached\r\nby Comte de Guichen to Martinique. These ships immediately gave chase;\r\nbut, night coming on, Captain Saumarez had recourse to stratagem in\r\norder to effect his escape, which would otherwise have been impossible\r\nin consequence of the Tisiphone having carried away her fore-top-mast\r\nin a squall, an accident which was fortunately not observed by his\r\npursuers: he now made night-signals by hoisting lights and burning\r\nfalse fires; which having led the enemy to suppose he was\r\ncommunicating with an English squadron, they abandoned the pursuit\r\nafter a chase of half-an-hour.\r\n\r\nAt the moment the fore-top-mast was carried away, Mr. Robb, one of the\r\nmidshipmen, who was looking out at the fore-top-gallant-mast-head,\r\nfell on the forecastle without receiving any injury. This young\r\ngentleman was an _eleve_ of Captain Saumarez, continued with him to\r\nthe end of that war, and embarked with him on board the Crescent in\r\n1793. After the capture of _La Reunion_, he was promoted to the rank\r\nof lieutenant.\r\n\r\nThe fore-top-mast of the Tisiphone was soon replaced; and next day, on\r\nreaching English Harbour, he learned that Sir Samuel Hood, with his\r\nsquadron was at anchor in Basseterre Roads, St. Kitts, where he had\r\nthree times repulsed the enemy of a much superior force, but which had\r\nnow taken up such a position as rendered it impossible for him to\r\ncommunicate with the admiral; for, unless he would venture to push\r\nthrough the intricate channel between Nevis and St. Kitts, he would\r\nrun the greatest risk of being captured. Undismayed, however, at the\r\ndanger of navigating an unknown passage, he fearlessly proceeded where\r\nno ship had ever before ventured; and by sounding as he advanced, and\r\nby the dexterous management of his ship, he succeeded in carrying the\r\nTisiphone to the anchorage at St. Kitts in safety; and delivered his\r\ndespatches to Sir Samuel Hood, who informed him that the intelligence\r\nwas of such importance, that it was necessary it should be immediately\r\nsent on to Sir Peter Parker at Jamaica. But when the admiral proposed\r\nto send the Tisiphone on with it, Captain Saumarez, desirous of\r\nremaining at the seat of warlike operations, represented to him that\r\nthe Tisiphone was a fine fast-sailing ship on a new construction, that\r\nin the existing state of affairs she might be useful, and that he\r\nshould be happy to contribute by his own personal exertions to the\r\npromotion of the public service; whereas any vessel could run down\r\nwith the trade-wind to Jamaica. Sir Samuel, no less pleased with the\r\nproposal, and the manner in which it was made, than convinced of the\r\nadvantage he would derive from having with him a fast-sailing vessel\r\ncommanded by so zealous an officer, whose tact and intrepidity had\r\nalready been manifested, determined to keep the Tisiphone with his\r\nsquadron, and send a less useful vessel with the intelligence to\r\nJamaica. The admiral soon reaped the advantage of this decision.\r\nCaptain Saumarez, during the time the fleet remained there and at\r\nAntigua, was the most active in harassing the enemy. He commanded\r\nseveral boat expeditions, and cut out a vessel in a most gallant style\r\nfrom Basseterre Roads and several other small vessels from the back of\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\nThe time, however, had now arrived when it was absolutely necessary to\r\nsend another despatch to England; and the admiral had no other small\r\nvessel remaining but the Tisiphone. On the 7th February 1782, the\r\nsignal was made for an opportunity of sending letters to England, and\r\nsubsequently for the captain of the Tisiphone: Captain Saumarez had\r\nbeen dining with his friend, Captain Charrington, on board the Ajax,\r\nand it was some time before he reached the Barfleur; when he found to\r\nhis dismay and mortification that he was ordered home! In a short\r\ntime the despatches were ready, and he had taken his leave. He\r\ndescribed this interesting circumstance, on which it may be said his\r\nfortune was founded, in the following manner to us, and we cannot do\r\nbetter than give it in his own words.\r\n\r\n\"I was,\" says he, \"in my own boat, with the despatches in my hand; and\r\nwith a heavy heart had ordered the bow-man to shove off, when Captain\r\nStanhope, of the Russell, came alongside, and seeing me called:\r\n'Hollo! Saumarez, where are you going?'--'To _England_', said I, 'I am\r\nsorry to tell you!'--'Sorry,' replied Stanhope; 'I wish I was in your\r\nplace; I want to go home on account of my health; and, if I had known,\r\nI would have exchanged with you.'--'Perhaps it is not too late,' said\r\nI.--'Hold on then,' said he, 'till I speak to the admiral, since I\r\nhave your leave.'\"\r\n\r\nBy this time the Russell's boat was alongside the admiral's ship; and\r\nat the word \"Hold on!\" which was emphatically repeated by Saumarez,\r\nthe bow-man hooked the quarter of the Russell's barge, and he remained\r\nbut a few minutes in breathless suspense; after which Captain Stanhope\r\nappeared at the gangway, and called, \"Come up, Saumarez.\" He was on\r\ndeck in an instant, and found that, on Captain Jackson being asked to\r\nsubmit the proposal to the admiral, he said, \"Let Captain Saumarez do\r\nit himself, he is the fittest person.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Samuel Hood heard the application, he was silent, and after\r\nreflecting for a few minutes he said, \"Captain Saumarez, you know not\r\nhow much I wish to serve you; Captain Stanhope shall go home as he\r\ndesires, and you shall have command of the Russell.\" Accordingly,\r\nbefore the close of that day, Captain Stanhope was on board the\r\nTisiphone on his way to England; while her late commander was in\r\npossession of his post-rank, and captain of one of his Majesty's ships\r\nof the line of seventy-four guns; and all this effected in less than\r\ntwo hours!\r\n\r\nWe cannot forbear making honourable mention of a trait of attachment\r\nmanifested on this occasion by the first lieutenant, a Scotch baronet\r\nof an ancient family, who had not been at sea for twenty-two years,\r\nwhen he was appointed to the Tisiphone. The conflict of this officer's\r\nfeelings between joy for his captain's promotion and regret at losing\r\nso excellent a friend was far beyond description; but, as the moment\r\nof parting approached, he selected what he considered most valuable,\r\nand so earnestly did he press Captain Saumarez to accept some\r\ntestimonial of his esteem, that, finding a refusal would deeply wound\r\nhis feelings, he accepted a silver ladle marked with his initials,\r\nwhich has ever since been carefully preserved in memory of its former\r\nowner.\r\n\r\nThe same night Captain Saumarez took command of the Russell, he had\r\ncause to find that promotion and honours bring cares. A report was\r\nmade to him that the ship was in a state of mutiny, and that a shot\r\nhad been thrown at one of the officers. He soon found, indeed, that he\r\nhad a most disorderly ship's company; but the firm, prompt, and\r\njudicious regulations which Captain Saumarez immediately established,\r\nbrought the crew so effectually into order, that two months after, at\r\nthe memorable battle of the 12th April 1782, no ship was in a higher\r\nstate of discipline than the Russell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n1782.\r\n\r\n   Situation of the Hostile Fleets.--Surrender of Brimstone\r\n   Hill.--Junction of the Fleets.--Antigua.--St. Lucia.--Sailing of\r\n   the French Fleet under Comte de Grasse.--Action of the 9th\r\n   April.--12th of April.--Gallant conduct of the Russell.--Captain\r\n   Saumarez returns to Jamaica.--Comes to England with Convoy.--Is\r\n   paid off at Chatham, and confirmed a Post-captain.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has now become necessary to give a brief account of the situation\r\nof the hostile fleets at the seat of war in the West Indies. While the\r\nenemy's troops were prosecuting the siege of Brimstone Hill, the fleet\r\nunder the Comte de Grasse had been reinforced, and either continued at\r\nsea, near to Basseterre, or anchored in the old road. On the 13th, a\r\npracticable breach being made in the works, the general and governor\r\nhaving given up all hopes of succour, and his brave garrison being\r\nreduced to five hundred men, they embraced the proposals of a\r\ncapitulation made by the Marquis de Boullie, who on the same day\r\nproclaimed the surrender of Brimstone Hill to the admiral by a flag of\r\ntruce, which had been previously agreed upon. The British fleet,\r\nwhich had till this time continued at the anchorage in which it had so\r\nbravely resisted the attacks of the Comte de Grasse, who on the 14th\r\nanchored off Nevis with thirty-four sail of the line, was now in a\r\nperilous situation, especially as the enemy were erecting mortar\r\nbatteries on the hill opposite to the shipping; and as it was no\r\nlonger necessary for him to continue there, Sir Samuel Hood issued\r\norders to slip or cut cables _without signal_ at eleven o'clock at\r\nnight, the sternmost and leeward-most ships first, and so on in\r\nsuccession, and proceed under easy sail until directed otherwise by\r\nsignal. That this order might be punctually executed, the captains\r\nwere ordered to set their watches by the admiral's timepiece. The\r\nmovement was performed with the utmost order and regularity. Not one\r\nship was molested or pursued by the French fleet, which was lying\r\nwithin five miles, and must have been astonished at this excellent\r\nmanoeuvre of the British admiral, wherein the Russell had a\r\ndistinguished share. Soon afterwards, Nevis and Montserrat fell into\r\nthe hands of the French.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th February, Sir Samuel Hood anchored in St. John's Road,\r\nAntigua; and on the same day, Sir George Rodney arrived at Barbadoes\r\nfrom England with several sail of the line. On the 25th, he joined Sir\r\nSamuel Hood off Antigua; and, three days after, three more sail of the\r\nline arrived from England. Thus fortunately united, the admiral\r\nproceeded to St. Lucia, to refit and complete with water. On the 14th\r\nof March he put to sea, with a view of intercepting a large French\r\nconvoy which was expected to arrive from Europe; but, notwithstanding\r\nthe vigilance of the frigates, the enemy, by keeping close to\r\nGuadaloupe and Dominique, effected their escape into Fort Royal Bay,\r\non the 20th and 21st, unperceived by any of our ships. When this\r\nunlucky event was made known to Sir George Rodney, he returned to St.\r\nLucia, to watch the motions of the enemy. In the mean time the\r\nRussell, which had been damaged by striking on a rock, was repaired at\r\nthe Carenage.\r\n\r\nThe Comte de Grasse was equally active in the equipment of his fleet,\r\nin order to proceed to leeward and form a junction with the Spaniards,\r\nfor the purpose of carrying into execution their grand object--the\r\nreduction of Jamaica, with an overwhelming force of sixty sail of the\r\nline and twenty thousand troops.\r\n\r\nAt daylight, on the 8th April, Captain Byron, of the Andromache,\r\ncommunicated to the admiral by signal the anxiously-expected\r\nintelligence that the enemy's fleet, with their large convoy, were\r\ncoming out of Fort Royal Bay, and standing to the north-west. Sir\r\nGeorge Rodney first made the signal for all boats, and persons who had\r\nbeen necessarily employed in watering, &c. to repair on board, and\r\nimmediately after to weigh. Before noon the whole fleet were clear of\r\nGros Islet Bay: Sir George stretched first over to Fort Royal, and\r\nthen made the general signal to chase north-eastward.\r\n\r\nThe enemy's lights were distinctly visible during the night; and as\r\ntheir ships-of-war, though better sailers than the English, were\r\ndelayed by the convoy of transports, there was little doubt of\r\novertaking them. Accordingly, at daylight on the morning of the 9th,\r\nsome of the advanced ships were close up with their convoy under\r\nDominique, while their men-of-war seemed much scattered: fourteen of\r\nthe latter were between Dominique and the Saints, with a breeze from\r\neast-north-east; but the rest were becalmed under the land about St.\r\nRupert's Bay, and one ship was observed at some distance in the\r\nnorth-west.\r\n\r\nAbout half-past seven, the van division, commanded by Sir Samuel Hood,\r\ngot the breeze; while the centre and rear, in which was the Russell,\r\ncontinued to be becalmed. This of course caused a separation, but did\r\nnot deter Sir Samuel Hood from advancing, although he had only eight\r\nships to fourteen of the enemy. In the mean time, the French ship seen\r\nin the north-west, which had got the breeze, boldly stood on and\r\nweathered the Alfred, the van-ship of Sir Samuel Hood's division,\r\nwhich bore up to allow her to pass; and, no signal having been made to\r\nengage, not a shot was fired.\r\n\r\nAt nine o'clock the action began, and was maintained with determined\r\nbravery for upwards of an hour, the enemy's ships which had the breeze\r\nhaving borne down upon and engaged this division; the Barfleur and\r\nothers had, at times, three to one opposed to them; and in this attack\r\nthere can be but one opinion, that the Comte de Grasse displayed great\r\nprofessional ability. At length the leading ships of the centre got up\r\nwith the enemy's rear, and were followed by the Duke, Formidable, and\r\nNamur; the Arrogant lost her main-top-mast, as well as the Royal Oak.\r\nThe rear squadron, commanded by Admiral Drake, now came up, and the\r\nComte de Grasse prudently hauled his wind; and as his ships sailed\r\nbetter than the English, he succeeded in gradually drawing off, and by\r\nhalf-past one his fleet were all out of the reach of shot.\r\n\r\nCaptain Bayne, of the Alfred, lost his life in this his sixth\r\nencounter with the enemy; and it is said that he bled to death after\r\nhis leg was shot off, before he was carried to the cockpit.\r\n\r\nIn the action of this day the Russell had only a small share, as she\r\nbelonged to the rear division of the fleet, and, being becalmed, could\r\nnot get up until the enemy had hauled off. The Royal Oak, Montagu, and\r\nAlfred were the ships which suffered most, but not so much as to\r\nprevent their being repaired at sea; while two of the enemy's ships\r\nwere so materially disabled as to oblige them to bear up for\r\nGuadaloupe. The necessary repairs of these ships were not completed\r\nbefore the 11th, during which time the enemy, by carrying a great\r\npress of sail, had gained so far to windward as to weather the Saints,\r\nand were nearly hull down; and, as it was supposed that the Comte de\r\nGrasse meant to abandon to their fate two of his ships of the line\r\nthat had been so much damaged in the late action as not to be able to\r\nkeep company, all hope of being able to come up with them seemed now\r\nto vanish.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the line had been inverted, which brought\r\nRear-admiral Drake's division in the van, and that of Rear-admiral\r\nHood, which had been engaged, in the rear. The signal having been made\r\nfor a general chase, the two ships above mentioned would have been cut\r\noff, had not De Grasse been induced to bear down to their relief. This\r\nbrought the enemy so far to leeward, that the hope of forcing them to\r\nengage was revived.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the commander-in-chief saw that the enemy's fleet was\r\nsufficiently to leeward, he recalled the chasing ships, formed a close\r\nline of battle, and carried sail to windward all night; during which\r\nthe French line-of-battle ship Le Zele, whether from injuries received\r\nin action, or in running foul of another ship, lost her bowsprit and\r\nfore-mast, and at daylight on the morning of the 12th was seen in tow\r\nof a frigate, both carrying all the sail they could, and steering for\r\nBasseterre. Sir Samuel Hood being in the rear, and consequently\r\nnearest these ships, was directed to detach some of his division in\r\nchase of them; and the Comte de Grasse, seeing that they must be\r\ninevitably taken, bore up with his whole fleet for their protection.\r\nIt was now impossible to avoid an action.\r\n\r\nThe ships which had been recalled from chase resumed their stations,\r\nand a close line ahead was formed on the starboard tack, the enemy\r\nbeing on the larboard. Having hauled their wind after they had\r\nperceived the chasing ships recalled, they thus endeavoured to avoid\r\nan action; but the English fleet could now fetch near the body of the\r\nFrench. At half-past seven, therefore, the engagement began by Admiral\r\nDrake's division, led by the Marlborough and Arrogant, fetching the\r\nfifth ship from the van, and bearing up in succession. The Honourable\r\nHugh Lindsay, who was a midshipman in the Arrogant, informed us that\r\nin that part, and in the whole of the action, the enemy fired so high,\r\nthat the three _trucks_ of the Princessa's mast-heads were shot away,\r\nand the consequence was that very few men were killed or wounded. The\r\nDuke lost her main-top-mast, as she approached the centre of the\r\nenemy's fleet.\r\n\r\nAt half-past nine the action became general: Admiral Drake's division,\r\nin which was the Russell, had now passed the rear of the enemy on the\r\nopposite tack; and Captain Thompson, of the America, seeing that he\r\ncould fetch to windward of the enemy's line, wore without waiting for\r\nthe anxiously-expected signal, as did also the Russell; and we have\r\nreason to know that Captain Saumarez rejoiced at this circumstance.\r\nCaptain Thompson, being an experienced officer and second in command,\r\ngave a sufficient authority to any other officer to follow his\r\nmotions, and they now stood to the southward. The America, however,\r\ndid not continue long on that tack, and the Russell was consequently\r\nseparated from her and the whole division; as the signals to tack, and\r\nsoon after to wear, were not made and put in execution for an hour\r\nafterwards by Sir Francis Drake, who was then considerably to the\r\nnorthward.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the Russell continued, and got up with the rear ship\r\nof the enemy's centre division about eleven o'clock, with which she\r\nexchanged broadsides. At noon, the wind, which was very light, changed\r\nto the south, throwing both fleets into confusion; but this gave Sir\r\nGeorge Rodney, and three of the centre division, an opportunity of\r\npassing through an opening it occasioned in the enemy's line, and\r\ndoubling on its rear division: all their attempts to form again were\r\nin vain; the enemy's van could never come into action. After this, the\r\nremainder of the day was spent in desultory actions of single ships,\r\nwithout regard to the motions of each other; the signals to chase and\r\nfor close action being visible only at intervals.\r\n\r\nIt is here unnecessary to give a particular account of the events\r\nwhich took place on this memorable day, or to allude to those\r\ncircumstances which have been so fruitful in controversy; more\r\nespecially as Rodney's public letter, and other official records, will\r\nbe found in the Appendix to this volume. We shall, therefore, confine\r\nour observations to the positions and conduct of the Russell,\r\ncommanded by Captain Saumarez.\r\n\r\nThe Russell was the only ship belonging to the van (Admiral Drake's)\r\ndivision, which had wore and continued her course soon after she had\r\npassed the rear of the enemy. By standing to the southward again,\r\nCaptain Saumarez brought his ship into action, but to _windward_ of\r\nthe enemy; and, at the time the wind shifted to the southward, Sir\r\nGeorge Rodney, in passing through the enemy's fleet, was surprised to\r\nfind an English ship to _windward_ of the French. Having ascertained\r\nit was the Russell, he declared emphatically that the captain had\r\ndistinguished himself more than any officer in the fleet.[4] By this\r\nfavourable position, which he had thus gallantly obtained, after\r\nreceiving the more distant fire of several of the enemy's ships, about\r\nthree o'clock he was able to come up with and closely engage a French\r\nseventy-four, and after exchanging broadsides with three others,\r\npushed up to the Ville de Paris, and after raking her, having\r\nmaintained a position on the lee quarter, poured in a most destructive\r\nfire, until the Barfleur, Sir Samuel Hood's flag-ship, came up.\r\n\r\n   [4] Ralfe's Naval Biography, Vol. ii. p. 378.\r\n\r\nSir Gilbert Blane, in his account of this period of the battle, says:\r\n\"It was late in the day when the Ville de Paris struck her colours:\r\nthe ships immediately engaged with her at that moment were the\r\nBarfleur, the flag-ship of Sir Samuel Hood, and the Russell, commanded\r\nby Captain Saumarez. The Formidable (in which was Sir Gilbert) was\r\nright astern, and, having come within shot, was yawing in order to\r\ngive the enemy a raking broadside, when Sir Charles Douglas and I\r\nstanding together on the quarter-deck, the position of our ship opened\r\na view of the enemy's stern between the foresail and the jib-boom,\r\nthrough which we saw the French flag hauled down.\" This fact has not\r\nbeen generally stated.\r\n\r\nBut the anecdote which we are now about to relate, must remove every\r\ndoubt on the subject. In the autumn of 1808, when the Baltic fleet,\r\nunder command of Vice-admiral Sir James Saumarez, returned from the\r\nGulf of Finland, in company with the Swedish fleet, to the harbour of\r\nCarlscrona, the Swedish commander-in-chief, Admiral Palmquist,\r\nRear-admiral Nauckhoff, Commodore Blessing, Captain Tornquist, and\r\nothers, came on board the flag-ship, Victory, to pay their respects to\r\nthe admiral: they were of course asked to take some refreshment in the\r\ncabin: on which, as on all other occasions where an interpreter was\r\nwanted, we were of the party. The conversation naturally turned to the\r\nactions wherein they each had served in early life, when it appeared\r\nthat the whole of the four officers mentioned had been brought up in\r\nthe French service, and had actually been in the battle of the 12th of\r\nApril 1782. When we acquainted them that Sir James Saumarez commanded\r\na ship in that action, they eagerly inquired the name; and being\r\ninformed it was the Russell, Captain Tornquist, who was in the\r\nNorthumberland, rising from his chair and seizing Sir James's hand,\r\nexclaimed, \"Mon Dieu! Monsieur l'Amiral, nous avons brule le poudre\r\nensemble; allons boire un coup.\"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to do justice to the scene which followed. The old\r\nSwedish officer's joy at this discovery knew no bounds; they\r\ncompletely \"fought the battle o'er again;\" and we found it distinctly\r\nproved that it was the Russell, commanded by Captain Saumarez, which\r\ngallantly engaged several of the enemy's ships for two hours, and at\r\nsix, P.M. pushed on to the Ville de Paris. Baron Rosenstien, who was\r\non board that ship, and Baron Palmquist, who was on board La Couronne\r\nstationed next to her, declared that the Compte de Grasse, who was\r\nthen attempting to escape to leeward, would have succeeded had it not\r\nbeen for the Russell. During our sojourn among the Swedes in that and\r\nanother winter, we often heard the history of that memorable battle\r\nrepeated; and they never ceased to maintain the circumstance we have\r\nstated, of which we made a memorandum at the time.[5]\r\n\r\n   [5] See Appendix for this memorandum, and for extracts from the\r\n   Russell, Canada, and Barfleur's logs; also Captain White's\r\n   reply, and extracts of letters from Sir Lawrence Halsted and\r\n   Admiral Gifford, who were in the Canada, and Captain Knight's\r\n   letter.\r\n\r\nWe took leave on that occasion to say to Sir James, that we believed\r\nthe credit had been given to another ship; to which he replied, \"Yes,\r\nit was; but what Admiral Palmquist and Captain Tornquist has told you,\r\nis true: it _was_ the Russell that engaged the Ville de Paris until\r\nthe Barfleur came up.\" But such was the extreme sensibility of\r\nSaumarez, that he could not persuade himself to correct the error,\r\nfrom an idea that such an interference might argue a desire to sound\r\nhis own praise; and, but for the circumstance we have now related, the\r\ntruth might never have come to light.\r\n\r\nIn answer to a letter from Captain Thomas White, which he sent to Lord\r\nde Saumarez with a copy of his publication, called \"Naval\r\nResearches,\" written in 1836, to defend the gallant Rodney from\r\ncertain attacks and allegations which had been published, _not_ to\r\ngive a \"full and perfect account of the battle, but,\" says Captain\r\nWhite, \"more particularly that part where your lordship so ably\r\ncommanded the Russell, which portion of our fleet the tongue of\r\ncalumny has never ventured to assail,\" Lord de Saumarez wrote the\r\nfollowing letter:\r\n\r\n   Guernsey, 13th June 1836.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n   I BEG to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, accompanying\r\n   your interesting publication, which you have done me the favour\r\n   to send for my acceptance, and which has been forwarded to me by\r\n   Lord Amelius Beauclerc.\r\n\r\n   I regret that you have (inadvertently, I am persuaded) fallen\r\n   into the same error as some of your predecessors, in detailing\r\n   the account of Lord Rodney's victory of the 12th of April, by\r\n   ascribing to the Canada what is alone due to the Russell, which\r\n   ship I commanded.\r\n\r\n   I shall for your information briefly state the circumstance to\r\n   which I allude. After passing the sternmost of the enemy's\r\n   ships, the America, the ship astern of the Russell, wore to\r\n   stand after them: I was glad to have the example of an old\r\n   experienced officer, and wore also; but Captain Thompson,\r\n   finding there was no signal, shortly after wore again, to join\r\n   Sir Samuel Drake's division. I stood on, till passing a division\r\n   of four of the enemy's ships, I exchanged broadsides with them,\r\n   and finally came up with the Ville de Paris, wore under her\r\n   stern and engaged her on the quarter for some time, when the\r\n   Barfleur came up, and the Comte de Grasse hauled down his\r\n   colours.\r\n\r\n   Even at this distant period, I have a perfect recollection of\r\n   the transactions of that day. I shall only add, that I am\r\n   convinced that no officer who was on board the Canada in the\r\n   victory of the 12th of April, will assert that she was engaged\r\n   with the Ville de Paris at the time stated. The present Admiral\r\n   Giffard was, I believe, one of the lieutenants, to whom I wish\r\n   to refer you.\r\n\r\n   I am, &c.\r\n   DE SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\nCaptain White, as well as other officers, is of opinion that Admiral\r\nDrake's division should have tacked sooner; and, as circumstances\r\nhappened, it would doubtless have been better if he had done so; but\r\nprobably the admiral, in continuing to stand on the same tack, had\r\ncalculated that the wind would continue in the same direction, or\r\nalter to the northward; in either case he would have weathered the\r\nwhole of the enemy's fleet, besides giving time to his division to\r\nrepair damages. The wind veering to the southward immediately after\r\nhis division had wore, had unfortunately the effect of throwing them\r\nto leeward; whereas the Russell, which wore as above stated, was by\r\nthe same change of wind far to windward of his division and nearer the\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the Ville de Paris struck her colours, which \"went down\r\nwith the setting sun,\" than the Russell made sail in chase of one of\r\nthe French ships which had deserted her chief, as also did Sir Samuel\r\nHood; but their noble efforts were arrested by the night signal to\r\nbring to, which put an end to the battle in that quarter: and although\r\nCommodore Affleck in the Bedford, and three others, who did not see\r\nthe signal, continued the chase, they were unable to come up with the\r\nenemy, who escaped to leeward in small divisions and single ships,\r\nleaving the Ville de Paris, the Glorieux, the Hector, and Caesar, in\r\npossession of the English.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 13th no enemy was in sight, and the ships which\r\nhad been in chase returned to the fleet. Admiral Rodney, with his\r\nprizes and the fleet, remained three days under Guadaloupe to repair\r\ndamages, which afforded the flying enemy an opportunity to escape;\r\nbut, on the 19th, the Caton and Jason, of sixty-four guns each, with\r\nthe Astree and Ceres, frigates, were added to the list of prizes by\r\nthe exertions of Sir Samuel Hood, Captains Goodall, and Linzee. On the\r\n23rd of April, Sir Samuel Hood rejoined the fleet off Tiberoon;\r\nwhereupon Sir George Rodney proceeded to Jamaica with those ships most\r\ndisabled, among which was the Russell and the prizes, leaving Sir\r\nSamuel Hood with a strong squadron to watch the enemy, should they\r\nventure out and attempt to prosecute their attack on Jamaica.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more flattering than the reception that Sir George\r\nRodney met with at Jamaica from the inhabitants, whose anxiety was so\r\nsuddenly supplanted by unbounded joy; and who not only found\r\nthemselves freed from the danger of invasion, but beheld the principal\r\ncommander of that overwhelming force which had caused them so much\r\nalarm a prisoner within their harbour, and six of his principal ships\r\nhaving the English colours triumphantly waving over the fleur-de-lis\r\nof France.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark that, down to this period, the Ville de Paris\r\nwas the only _first-rate_ man-of-war that had ever been taken and\r\ncarried into port by any commander of any nation! The Ville de Paris,\r\nin the capture of which Captain Saumarez had a distinguished share,\r\nwas the largest ship in the French navy: she had been a present from\r\nthe city of Paris to Louis XV. and no expense had been spared to\r\nrender the gift worthy of the city and of the monarch. Her length was\r\n185 feet 7-1/2 inches, her breadth 53 feet 8-1/2, depth 22 feet 2, and\r\n2347 tons' measurement; and the expense of building her and sending\r\nher to sea is said to have been 156,000_l._ On board her at the time\r\nof capture were found thirty-six chests of money intended for the pay\r\nand subsistence of the men who were to be employed in the expedition\r\nagainst Jamaica; and she had on board, at the commencement of the\r\naction on the 9th, 1,300 men: in the other captured ships, the whole\r\ntrain of artillery, the battering cannon and carriages meant for the\r\nexpedition, were found.\r\n\r\nThe loss of men in the British fleet in both actions was very small,\r\namounting to only two hundred and thirty-seven killed, and seven\r\nhundred and seventy-six wounded; while the loss of the French was\r\ncomputed to be three thousand slain, and double that number wounded.\r\nIn the Ville de Paris alone three hundred were killed.\r\n\r\nIn the engagement on the 9th of April, the French fleet consisted of\r\nthirty-four sail of the line, and the British of thirty-six; but in\r\nthat engagement, two of the enemy's ships having been disabled, their\r\nnumerical force was reduced in the battle of the 12th to thirty-two\r\nsail of the line: on the other hand, the French ships were much larger\r\nthan the British; and it was calculated by Sir Charles Douglas, that\r\nthe broadside of the French fleet exceeded that of the British in\r\nweight by 4396 pounds, and their numerical superiority in men was much\r\ngreater.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of April, the Comte de Grasse was removed to the\r\nflag-ship; and, some days after, when Captain Saumarez went on board\r\nthe Formidable after the action, and several times after their arrival\r\nat Jamaica, the Comte de Grasse acknowledged that the Ville de Paris\r\nsuffered very severely from the well-directed fire of the Russell.\r\n\r\nAmong the instances of heroic submission and perseverance under the\r\nseverest suffering, may be recorded the conduct of the captain of the\r\nmain-top of the Russell, who having received a shot that carried off\r\none of his arms, instead of requesting the assistance of his\r\ncompanions to take him below, insisted that they should continue at\r\ntheir stations, and let himself down by one of the backstays. After\r\nsuffering amputation, he persisted in going again on deck, where he\r\nremained encouraging the men till the action terminated.\r\n\r\nOn the arrival of the fleet at Jamaica, the Russell was found to be in\r\nso disabled a state, that Sir George Rodney intended to send her home\r\nwith the Ville de Paris and the other prizes, and arrangements were\r\nmade for that purpose accordingly. His old friend, Sir Peter Parker,\r\nwho had held the command at Jamaica, sailed in the Sandwich, on board\r\nwhich ship was the Comte de Grasse, for England, with a convoy of\r\nmerchant-ships. After having been at sea three days, the Ajax, one of\r\nthe ships under his command, sprang a leak, returned to Bluefields\r\nBay, and the Russell was ordered to follow the fleet in her stead. The\r\nexertions which Captain Saumarez used to refit his ship obtained the\r\ncommander-in-chief's highest approbation. In two days he was ready,\r\nand immediately joined the Sandwich and Intrepid, which now sailed\r\nwith the trade under convoy, and preceded the prizes, which were not\r\nyet ready to undertake the voyage to England; and it was owing to\r\nthis interposition of Providence, that the Russell escaped the\r\nmelancholy fate which afterwards befel the unfortunate fleet, in which\r\nthe ill-fated Ville de Paris was lost with all her crew. The Russell\r\nhad on board three hundred French prisoners and twenty-two officers,\r\nand arrived at the Downs on the 29th July 1782. She was ordered to be\r\npaid off at Chatham, to which port she proceeded. On her arrival\r\nthere, an order came from the Admiralty to draft her crew into a ship\r\nwhich was under order to sail for the East Indies. This excited a\r\ngeneral murmur, and at length the men refused to obey. On Captain\r\nSaumarez being informed of it, he went on board and remonstrated, when\r\nthey unanimously declared that, although they had but just returned\r\nfrom a long voyage, they would follow him all the world over. Before\r\nhe left the ship, however, he prevailed on them to resume their duty;\r\nand these orders were subsequently altered. After returning her\r\nstores, the Russell was paid off on the 24th of September. Captain\r\nSaumarez' acting commission as a post-captain, dated on the 8th of\r\nFebruary 1782, was confirmed by Earl Howe; and no officer in his\r\nMajesty's service more richly deserved his promotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n1784 to 1793.\r\n\r\n   Captain Saumarez returns to Guernsey.--His exemplary\r\n   Conduct.--Visits Cherbourg.--Is introduced to the French\r\n   King.--Returns.--Changes at Guernsey.--Prince William Henry\r\n   visits the Island twice.--His Reception.--Appearance of\r\n   Hostilities in 1787.--Captain Saumarez is appointed to the\r\n   Ambuscade, and pays her off.--His Letter on his\r\n   Marriage.--Remarks thereon.--Armament of 1790.--Saumarez\r\n   commissions and pays off the Raisonable.--War of\r\n   1793.--Appointed to command the Crescent.--First Cruise; takes a\r\n   prize and saves Alderney.--Second Cruise; captures a\r\n   cutter.--Third Cruise.--Return.--Crescent docked and refitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Saumarez having paid off the Russell, and distributed his crew\r\ninto different ships according to the final orders he had received\r\nfrom the Admiralty, repaired to London, and after paying his respects\r\nto Earl Howe, proceeded to Guernsey to receive the congratulations of\r\nhis numerous friends; but these were far from altering \"the natural\r\nbent of his disposition to do good.\" Instead of becoming elevated by\r\nprosperity, his sincere and unaffected piety induced him to take a\r\nleading part in the establishment of charitable institutions, and in\r\nhis own person to give \"a striking and useful example of moral and\r\nreligious life.\" But his noble mind was never diverted from the\r\nservice and the good of his country; he was constantly attentive to\r\nevery circumstance that concerned the duties of his profession, and an\r\nevent occurred about this time that peculiarly interested him.\r\n\r\nAlthough this was a period of profound peace, the ambition of France\r\nwas constantly awake. It had long been the object of the French\r\ngovernment to form a naval port in the British Channel, for the\r\nevident, if not avowed, purpose of annoying our trade in time of war,\r\nand disputing with us the dominion of the British seas. No labour\r\nhowever arduous, and no expense however great, could check this\r\nfavourite design. The port of Cherbourg, which had long been fixed\r\nupon as being immediately adjacent to our great arsenal at Portsmouth,\r\nbecame the point of attraction. The unfortunate Louis XVI. had\r\ndetermined to stimulate this grand undertaking by his presence, when\r\nthe first _cone_ was submerged.\r\n\r\nThe assemblage of the French court opposite our own coast naturally\r\nattracted a number of our countrymen, among whom was Captain Saumarez,\r\nwho was induced to cross the Channel probably by a secret wish to\r\nexamine the nautical projects of our rivals, to counteract which,\r\nmight at some future period become his duty. This was eventually the\r\ncase in 1793, when he captured the French frigate Reunion off that\r\nvery harbour, from which she had sailed only a few hours before the\r\naction.\r\n\r\nCaptain Saumarez was present at the above imposing ceremony, and had\r\nthe honour of being introduced to the French king, by whom he was\r\ntreated with the greatest attention. It is worthy of remark, that this\r\nwas the only time during his long life that he ever set his foot in\r\nFrance, and he returned directly to Guernsey much gratified by his\r\nexcursion.\r\n\r\nBetween the period of Captain Saumarez' departure from Guernsey in\r\n1776, and his return in 1782, the island of Guernsey had undergone\r\ngreat and important changes. The war with America had brought an\r\ninflux of strangers; wealth and its attendant luxuries had superseded\r\nthe simple mode of living of its inhabitants; society had extended;\r\nand when the peace took place, at the close of 1782, no spot of its\r\nsize could display a greater appearance of prosperity, civilization,\r\nand beauty.\r\n\r\nBetween the years 1785 and 1787, the island was twice honoured with a\r\nvisit from Prince William Henry, our present most gracious sovereign;\r\nand, however great the change had been in men and manners since it had\r\nbeheld a prince of the blood on its shores, the loyalty of the\r\nislanders had sustained no diminution, and the arrival of the prince,\r\nthen a lieutenant of the Hebe, Captain Thornborough, excited the most\r\nunbounded joy. Every one's heart glowed at seeing the son of a monarch\r\nwhom they were accustomed to regard with veneration and love; and as\r\npeople who lived in the habitual belief that to \"fear God and honour\r\nthe King\" is a \"united precept,\" every mark of respect and attachment\r\nwas exhibited on both occasions. When his Royal Highness came the\r\nsecond time, as captain of the Pegasus, the homage, which had been\r\npaid to him at the first visit, as son of their sovereign, was mingled\r\nwith respect to himself. Some there are who yet remember, and still\r\ndelight to relate, the account of the elegant _dejeune_ with which the\r\nillustrious prince entertained a party on board the Pegasus; after\r\nwhich his Royal Highness honoured Captain Saumarez and his brothers\r\nwith his company at dinner, and attended a ball in the evening at the\r\nassembly-rooms.\r\n\r\nIn 1787, when Captain Saumarez had nearly attained his thirtieth year,\r\npeace seemed to be completely established. At an early age he had\r\nattained, by his own merit, the highest rank to which an officer could\r\nbe advanced: he had fully established a character equally exalted for\r\ncourage and professional talent; and having been, wherever Fortune had\r\nplaced him, always in the best society, his manners as a gentleman\r\nwere no less elegant than his person, which was tall and graceful,\r\nwhile his handsome features denoted a heart susceptible of the\r\ndictates both of humanity and love. It is not then to be wondered at,\r\nwhen he returned to his native island, that he still cherished an\r\nattachment which he had long formed; especially when he found her on\r\nwhom he had fixed his affections, possessed of every quality which\r\ncould ensure mutual happiness; neither can it appear surprising that\r\non her part the regard should be equally warm and sincere.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of hostilities in the same year, however, occasioned a\r\nsuspension of his matrimonial arrangements, as he was then appointed\r\nby Lord Howe to the command of the Ambuscade frigate, which he had\r\nscarcely fitted before she was ordered to be paid off, the hostile\r\ndifferences having been adjusted. He now returned to Guernsey, and, on\r\nthe 8th October 1788, was united to Miss Martha Le Marchant, only\r\ndaughter and heir of Thomas Le Marchant, Esq. by his marriage with\r\nMiss Mary Dobree, to the entire satisfaction of the families and\r\nrelations on both sides.\r\n\r\nThe following extract of a private letter to his brother Richard,\r\nwritten a few days after his marriage, will give the reader a just\r\nidea of the feelings which occupied his mind on this happy occasion:\r\n\r\n\"It is needless,\" he says, \"to attempt giving you any idea of my joy\r\non this occasion. The abundant blessings which Providence is pleased\r\nto pour down on me, who am ever unworthy the least of its favours,\r\nmakes my heart glow with boundless gratitude and love, which I hope\r\never to testify by a life strictly devoted to His service. To have the\r\npower of making her happy who has ever been the joy and delight of my\r\nsoul, far surpasses all that I had ever formed of felicity in this\r\nworld. I must also acknowledge the affectionate kindness of her\r\nrelations, who have for ever attached me to them by the confidence\r\nthey have placed in me.\"\r\n\r\nThese self-congratulations were, indeed, fully confirmed in after\r\nlife; for few husbands have ever been blessed with such a devoted\r\nwife, or children with such an affectionate mother. During their\r\nyounger days, and when their gallant father was at sea, Mrs. Saumarez\r\nlived retired, giving up her whole time to their instruction; and we\r\ncan most fully testify that gratitude for her maternal anxiety, both\r\nfor their spiritual and temporal welfare, has been indelibly impressed\r\non all their hearts.\r\n\r\nAfter passing some time at Guernsey, Captain Saumarez removed to the\r\nneighbourhood of Exeter, where he resided two years. In 1790,\r\nappearances of hostility took place. The Spanish armament was not to\r\nbe lightly regarded. Captain Saumarez was appointed to command the\r\nRaisonable of 64 guns; but he never went to sea in this ship, the\r\ndifferences between the two nations having been amicably settled. It\r\nseemed to show, however, that, in the event of war, he was one of\r\nthose who were to be actively employed.\r\n\r\nCaptain Saumarez remained on shore until the war occasioned by the\r\nFrench revolution broke out in 1793, when he was appointed to command\r\nthe Crescent of 36 guns. His commission was dated on the 24th January,\r\nand he hoisted his pendant in her at Portsmouth on the 28th of the\r\nsame month, receiving, at the same time, orders to place himself under\r\nthe command of Commodore Sir Hyde Parker. No sooner was it known at\r\nGuernsey, and in Devonshire, that the Crescent was commissioned by\r\nCaptain Saumarez, than a number equal to half the complement of seamen\r\nvolunteered for the Crescent; and, on the 1st of February, the\r\nTisiphone sloop was sent to bring the men from Guernsey, while the\r\nrest, from Exeter, were sent by the way of Plymouth to join the ship.\r\nIt could not but be highly gratifying to his feelings when he found\r\nthat so many of his countrymen had chosen to devote themselves to his\r\nservice; and he was soon able to report his ship ready for sea.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of February 1793, in common with other officers, he\r\nreceived the following intelligence that war had been declared against\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n   By Sir Hyde Parker, Knt. &c.\r\n\r\n   Accounts having been received that war was declared at Paris, by\r\n   the National Convention of France, against Great Britain and\r\n   Holland; you are, in pursuance of the King's pleasure, signified\r\n   to the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty by the Right\r\n   Honourable Henry Dundas, one of his Majesty's principal\r\n   secretaries of state, hereby required and directed to seize or\r\n   destroy all ships and vessels belonging to France that you may\r\n   happen to fall in with.\r\n\r\n   Given under my hand, on board the Victory,\r\n   this 10th day of February 1793.\r\n   H. PARKER.\r\n\r\n   To Captain Saumarez, R.N.\r\n\r\nThe Crescent having been reported ready for sea on the 1st of March,\r\nCaptain Saumarez received orders to proceed to Guernsey with his ship,\r\naccompanied by the Liberty brig, and three transports under convoy, to\r\nreinforce the garrisons of the Channel islands. He had also sealed\r\norders, which were to be put in execution when the troops were landed\r\nat Guernsey and Jersey. The following account of this cruise was sent\r\nto his brother, on the ship's return to Guernsey Road.\r\n\r\n   H.M.S. Crescent, Guernsey, 18th March 1793.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR RICHARD,\r\n\r\n   As the detail of our proceedings on our first cruise cannot but\r\n   be acceptable to you, I take up my pen to communicate them. We\r\n   anchored in this road on Sunday morning, the day after we had\r\n   sailed from Spithead. The independent companies and invalids for\r\n   this island were immediately disembarked. The wind being too\r\n   much to the southward for the transports to proceed to Jersey,\r\n   they remained till Thursday following, when I sent them under\r\n   convoy of the Liberty brig.\r\n\r\n   On Thursday morning, intelligence was brought to me that a\r\n   French brig was seen to the northward of the island, standing\r\n   for the Casketts. I immediately got under way, and directed the\r\n   Drake to do the same. We pushed through the Race of Alderney\r\n   during the night, and at day-break found ourselves close to the\r\n   brig, off Cherbourg. She is about 100 tons, from Vannes, loaded\r\n   with salt, for Havre. Seeing another brig and a galliot to the\r\n   N.W. from us, I ordered the Drake and Cockatrice to chase, and I\r\n   have hopes they are also prizes.\r\n\r\n   About three o'clock, it blowing very hard, I was much surprised\r\n   at an express joining me from Alderney, with a letter from the\r\n   governor, addressed to the commander of H.M. ships off\r\n   Alderney, mentioning that he had positive information that the\r\n   enemy meant to attack the island this or the following night;\r\n   and as there was no ship of force at Cherbourg but an old 64,\r\n   with frigate's masts, he was certain that the appearance of a\r\n   man-of-war off Cherbourg would preserve Alderney, and baffle the\r\n   expedition. Chance having thrown me off Cherbourg, within sight\r\n   the whole day, I was happy the purport of this letter was so\r\n   fully answered. Expecting further intelligence, I waited till a\r\n   cutter hailed us that he was going express to Plymouth. No other\r\n   vessel appearing, I made sail for this island, and anchored in\r\n   the road this morning. I have scarcely a doubt that what caused\r\n   your brother[6] to be alarmed was the appearance of this ship,\r\n   the Drake and Cockatrice, with another small vessel in the Race\r\n   of Alderney; and I am sorry it was not in my power to acquaint\r\n   him with it, as the vessel he sent me returned immediately.\r\n\r\n   [6] Governor Le Mesurier was brother to Mrs. Richard Saumarez.\r\n\r\nCaptain Saumarez, on his return to Guernsey, wrote to Governor Le\r\nMesurier, and, in reply to his letter, informed him that the\r\nappearance of the Crescent and squadron off Cherbourg had the desired\r\neffect of baffling the meditated attack on Alderney; nevertheless, the\r\nCrescent was detained on that station until the 25th, in consequence\r\nof other reports of the enemy's intentions to attack either Jersey or\r\nAlderney, and his squadron therefore was reinforced. In the mean time\r\nhe succeeded in filling up the complement of his crew at Guernsey, and\r\nat length returned to Spithead, when some alteration took place in the\r\narmament of his ship: having there completed his stores and\r\nprovisions, Captain Saumarez' next employment was to take a convoy of\r\ntransports with troops to Cork, and bring from thence two regiments to\r\nGuernsey. This service occupied his ship until the 4th of May, when\r\nshe arrived off the Lizard, and, having sent part of his convoy into\r\nFalmouth, he anchored at Guernsey on the following day.\r\n\r\nHe left Guernsey on the 15th of May, having six transports with French\r\nprisoners on board, and arrived at Spithead on the 17th.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd Captain Saumarez received orders from the Admiralty to\r\ntake the Hind, Captain Cochrane, under his command, and proceed with\r\nthe Crescent and that ship to cruise between lat. 51 deg. and 47 deg. N. and\r\nlong. 10 deg. to 16 deg. W. for the protection of the trade, and continue on\r\nthat service for three weeks. The account of this cruise, in which\r\ntwo prizes were taken, is given in the following letter to his\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\n   Crescent, Spithead, 26th June 1793.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR RICHARD,\r\n\r\n   I have the pleasure to acquaint you with our return from a\r\n   cruise which has been rather unsuccessful, having only taken\r\n   (besides the brig I informed you of) a cutter called \"Le Club de\r\n   Cherbourg,\" of ten guns. She sailed from Brest on the 20th\r\n   instant, and was found on the coast of Ireland, where she had\r\n   done much mischief on her former cruise, having taken four\r\n   vessels within a few days. I find by the prisoners that the\r\n   French have only eighteen sail from Brest in readiness for sea.\r\n   They rendezvous in Quiberon Bay as soon as they are equipped. I\r\n   hope Lord Howe will soon give a good account of all of them. I\r\n   anchored at Guernsey for a few hours, where I left the cutter\r\n   for my brother's disposal.\r\n\r\n   As we have been parted from the Hind since the 8th instant, I\r\n   hope to find she may have met with success. We are under\r\n   agreement to share till the expiration of our cruise. As I write\r\n   before we anchor, you cannot expect I should give you an account\r\n   of my further destination; but, from what they informed me in\r\n   the island, we are to go with Lord Howe, which hurried me from\r\n   there. All the family were in perfect health at six o'clock on\r\n   Tuesday evening, when I left them. We must now console ourselves\r\n   with the hope that we shall soon terminate the business. I think\r\n   this year will nearly do it. We anxiously sought for an\r\n   opportunity similar to the Nymphe. We traversed the bay (Biscay)\r\n   in every direction, without the appearance of a French ship; and\r\n   on Monday we were all day in sight of Ushant, but could never\r\n   meet with any but neutral vessels. Our next cruise may probably\r\n   prove more fortunate. With my affectionate love to my sister\r\n   and the children, I am, my dear Richard,\r\n\r\n   Yours truly,\r\n   JAMES SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen by the date of this letter, that the Crescent had\r\narrived at Spithead on the 26th, which is the date of his official\r\nletter to the Admiralty, giving an account of the capture of Le\r\nClub, which, being the same as already given, need not be repeated.\r\n\r\nThe Crescent, being replenished with water and provisions, was\r\ndirected on the 4th July to take on board a quantity of specie for\r\nPlymouth, to which he sailed on the 5th, and, having delivered it\r\nthere, took a convoy from thence to the Downs, where he arrived on the\r\n18th July, and, according to further orders, returned with the trade\r\nunder convoy from thence to Spithead on the 20th.\r\n\r\nThe following order, which Captain Saumarez received from the Lords of\r\nthe Admiralty, will show the nature of the service on which he was now\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\n   By the Commissioners for executing the office of Lord High\r\n   Admiral of Great Britain and Ireland, &c.\r\n\r\n   CAPTAIN SAUMAREZ,\r\n\r\n   You are to take his Majesty's ships named on the margin\r\n   (Concorde and Thames) under your command, (their captains being\r\n   directed to follow your orders,) and putting to sea with them\r\n   and the Crescent, the moment the wind and weather will permit,\r\n   proceed and cruise between the latitudes of 49 deg. and 50 deg. 30'\r\n   north, and from sixty to one hundred leagues to the westward of\r\n   the Scilly Islands, for the protection of the trade of his\r\n   Majesty's subjects, and the annoyance of the enemy, taking all\r\n   possible care of the above-mentioned frigates; and diligently\r\n   looking out for, and using your best endeavours to fall in with,\r\n   the homeward-bound convoys from Jamaica and the Leeward Islands,\r\n   which are daily expected, and which are to be the principal\r\n   objects of your attention.\r\n\r\n   In case of falling in with either of the said convoys, you are\r\n   to see, or cause to be seen, such of the merchant ships or\r\n   vessels as may be bound to Ireland, or into the Bristol Channel,\r\n   as far as may be necessary for their security, and those bound\r\n   into the English Channel, as far as the Start; and, having so\r\n   done, return with the frigates under your command to the\r\n   above-mentioned station, to look out for the other convoy; and,\r\n   having met with it, to see, or cause to be seen, such of the\r\n   merchant vessels as may be bound to Ireland, and into the\r\n   Bristol Channel, as before directed, and to see those bound up\r\n   the English Channel off their respective ports, as high as\r\n   Spithead, where you are to remain until further orders, sending\r\n   to our secretary an account of your arrival and proceedings.\r\n\r\n   You are to continue on the above-mentioned service until the\r\n   20th of next month, unless you shall have fallen in with both\r\n   the said convoys sooner; when you are to make the best of your\r\n   way to Spithead, and remain there as above directed.\r\n\r\n   Given under our hands, this 18th day of July 1793.\r\n   CHATHAM,\r\n   J. SMYTH,\r\n   CHs. S. PYBUS.\r\n\r\n   To James Saumarez, Esq. &c.\r\n   By command of their lordships.\r\n   P. STEPHENS.\r\n\r\nCaptain Saumarez received at the same time information of the number\r\nof ships expected from the different islands in both the convoys, took\r\nthe Concorde and Thames under his command, and sailed from Spithead on\r\nthe 26th of July 1793.\r\n\r\nNext to the command of a fleet, that of a squadron of frigates was at\r\nthis period of the war considered the most important, and it could not\r\nbut be highly gratifying to Captain Saumarez to find himself selected\r\nagain for such a desirable command; but Fortune did not favour his\r\nlittle detachment. The convoys, which they had been sent to look out\r\nfor and protect, had arrived safely at the respective ports before the\r\nsquadron reached their destination, and they continued to cruise in\r\nvain within the prescribed limits of their station, till at length\r\nthey were assailed by a tremendous gale from the south-east on the\r\n17th of August, in which the Concorde parted company, the Thames lost\r\nher bowsprit and bore up for England, while the Crescent sprung her\r\nmain-yard, and by a sudden shift of wind to the northward carried away\r\nher main-top-mast, and, her orders for returning into port having\r\nexpired, she arrived at Spithead after an unsuccessful cruise.\r\n\r\nThe Crescent had not been in dock since the year 1785, and required\r\nmuch refitting: Captain Saumarez, therefore, on reporting his arrival\r\nto the Secretary of the Admiralty, sent also a statement of the\r\nship's defects; in consequence of which, an order was sent for her to\r\nbe docked at Portsmouth, and refitted for Channel service, while one\r\nhundred of her crew were lent to the Vanguard. As this process\r\nrequired a considerable time, Captain Saumarez sent for his family;\r\nand, having taken apartments at Ryde, had a few weeks of enjoyment in\r\ntheir society, and of relaxation from the arduous duties of his\r\nprofession. The Crescent was received into dock on the 25th August,\r\nand was again fit for sea on the 10th October, when he received orders\r\nto hold himself ready to proceed at a moment's notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n1793.\r\n\r\n   Crescent refitted.--Sails for the Channel Islands.--Falls in\r\n   with the French frigate La Reunion.--Particular account of the\r\n   action.--Letters from Captain Saumarez to his brother.--Brings\r\n   his prize to Portsmouth.--Official letters.--Letters from\r\n   various persons.--Ship refitting.--Captain Saumarez obtains\r\n   leave of absence.--Is knighted for his gallant conduct.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Crescent being now ready for sea, but with thirteen men short of\r\nher complement, Captain Saumarez applied to have the number filled up,\r\nas her masts and yards were of the same dimensions as those of a\r\nfrigate of thirty-eight guns; he also requested such increase as the\r\nLords of the Admiralty thought proper: but these applications were\r\nunsuccessful, and on the 10th of October he received orders from Sir\r\nPeter Parker, the port-admiral, to \"hold himself in constant readiness\r\nto put to sea at a moment's warning;\" and it was not long before the\r\nfollowing order was received from the Admiralty.\r\n\r\n   By the Commissioners for executing the office of Lord High\r\n   Admiral, &c.\r\n\r\n   You are hereby required and directed to proceed in the ship\r\n   under your command, without a moment's loss of time, to the\r\n   islands of Guernsey and Jersey; and so soon as you shall have\r\n   delivered the pacquets you will herewith receive, addressed to\r\n   the commanding officers of his Majesty's troops serving in these\r\n   islands, you are to repair with the said ship off St. Maloes,\r\n   and use your best endeavours to obtain such information of the\r\n   enemy's forces there, as circumstances will admit.\r\n\r\n   Having so done, you are to return with the said ship with all\r\n   possible despatch, for further orders, transmitting to our\r\n   secretary, for our information, by post-office express, an\r\n   account of your arrival and proceedings.\r\n\r\n   Given under our hands, this 18th October 1793,\r\n   A. GARDNER.\r\n   J. SMYTH.\r\n   P. AFFLECK.\r\n\r\n   To Captain Saumarez, R.N.\r\n\r\nFor several days previously to the 19th, it had been reported that a\r\nFrench frigate usually quitted the port of Cherbourg at night, and\r\nreturned next morning with what prizes she had picked up: this,\r\ntogether with the information that an armament was preparing for the\r\ninvasion of Jersey, caused Captain Saumarez to make extraordinary\r\nexertions to get to sea; and, although the wind was light, he\r\nfortunately succeeded in getting round St. Helens before night. Early\r\non the morning, on the 20th, he was close to the light-house off Cape\r\nBarfleur.\r\n\r\nACTION BETWEEN THE CRESCENT AND REUNION.\r\n\r\nThis gallant action, which we are now about to describe, having been\r\nmisrepresented in every account yet published, we have, in order to\r\nmake the circumstances attending it more easily understood,\r\nillustrated the positions by a diagram, showing the masterly\r\nmanoeuvre performed by the Crescent, and the relative situation of\r\nthe ships at the commencement and the end of the conflict. The\r\nengraving shows the state and situation of the two ships at the time\r\nthe Reunion surrendered.\r\n\r\nDuring the night, the wind had been so far to the westward as to\r\nenable the Crescent to fetch Cape Barfleur, while the Reunion, which\r\nleft Cherbourg in the evening, stood to the northward, in hopes of\r\nmeeting with merchant-ships coming up Channel. The two frigates,\r\ntherefore, must have crossed each other at no great distance; but the\r\nwind having changed towards the south about daylight, and the French\r\nfrigate being unable to fetch back to Cherbourg, broke off with her\r\nhead to the eastward, while the Crescent, by coming up on the opposite\r\ntack, was enabled to weather and get in shore of the enemy.\r\n\r\nShortly after day-break Captain Saumarez saw two sail standing on the\r\nstarboard tack towards the Crescent, and it appears that they had\r\napproached her within two miles before they discovered themselves to\r\nbe under the lee of an English frigate: they then tacked and made all\r\nsail, either for the purpose of trying to escape, or to approach\r\nnearer to Cherbourg, that they might have the assistance of their\r\nconsort then in the harbour with her sails hoisted up. It was soon\r\nevident that the Crescent, now \"clean out of dock,\" had the advantage\r\nin sailing; and, by half-past ten, Captain Saumarez, by edging down,\r\ntook his position on the enemy's larboard quarter within pistol-shot,\r\nwhen the action began.\r\n\r\nCaptain John Tancock, who was then a midshipman stationed on the\r\nmain-deck, says that the men had directions to fire at the rudder of\r\ntheir opponent, which was very soon disabled, while the\r\nmain-topsail-yard and fore-yard were both shot away. The enemy fired\r\nso high that scarcely any shot struck the hull of the Crescent; but,\r\nconsequently, her fore-topsail-yard, and soon afterwards her\r\nfore-top-mast, fell over the starboard gangway. Hitherto the ship had\r\nbeen kept in her first position by backing and filling the\r\nmizen-topsail, but now she came to, and eventually _came round_: but\r\nCaptain Saumarez, whose presence of mind never forsook him, brailed up\r\nthe mizen, and, by keeping all the square-sails aback, gave the ship a\r\n_stern-board_; at the same time, by keeping the _helm up_, she wore\r\nround on her heel, obtaining a position under the stern and on the\r\nstarboard quarter, while the enemy was lying with his yards square and\r\ntotally unmanageable. This manoeuvre is shown in the diagram, to\r\nwhich an explanation is added.\r\n\r\nIllustration:\r\n\r\nC. The Crescent. R. The Reunion. 1. Commencement of the\r\naction. 2. The Crescent's track in wearing on her heel. 3. The\r\nposition when the Reunion struck.\r\n\r\nIn passing under the enemy's stern, it was observed that his colours\r\nhad been shot away, and, supposing he had struck, the firing ceased;\r\nbut, on coming round on the starboard quarter, the enemy again opened\r\nhis fire. The Crescent, having now got her larboard guns to bear,\r\nreturned his broadside with such effect, that at twenty minutes past\r\nnoon the officers of the Reunion waved their hats and flags to\r\nindicate that they had surrendered. The engraving represents the\r\nsituation of the two ships at this moment; and Captain Sir Thomas\r\nMansel, who was then a midshipman, declares it to be correct.\r\n\r\nThe combat now ceased, and the prize was taken possession of by\r\nLieutenant (now Admiral) Sir George Parker, who received the usual\r\norder to carry her into port. The French captain being sent on board\r\nthe Crescent, they began to remove the prisoners and repair damages.\r\nWhen the action began, a ship had been seen under the land to the\r\neastward, about four leagues distant; this was supposed to be an\r\nenemy: but it turned out to be the Circe, Captain Yorke, who joined\r\nfour hours after the action, and took part of the prisoners. In the\r\nmean time the cutter made off towards Cherbourg, out of which harbour\r\nthe wind and adverse tide prevented the other frigate, said to be La\r\nSemillante, from getting to assist the Reunion.\r\n\r\nThe following very concise official letter to the Secretary of the\r\nAdmiralty from Captain Saumarez, supplies the rest of the detail.\r\n\r\n   Crescent, off Cherbourg, 20th October 1793.\r\n\r\n   SIR,\r\n\r\n   I have the honour to acquaint you, for the information of my\r\n   Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, that this morning, being\r\n   off Cape Barfleur in his Majesty's ship Crescent, under my\r\n   command, I fell in with a French frigate, which, after a close\r\n   action of two hours and ten minutes, struck to his Majesty's\r\n   colours: she proved to be the Reunion, mounting thirty-six guns,\r\n   and manned with three hundred and twenty men.\r\n\r\n   I am singularly happy in being able to inform their lordships\r\n   that she has been obtained without the loss of a single man, or\r\n   even any wounded, although her own loss has been very\r\n   considerable indeed, having, as the prisoners informed me, one\r\n   hundred and twenty killed and wounded.\r\n\r\n   I must beg leave to render the most ample justice to the\r\n   officers and ship's company of the Crescent, for their cool and\r\n   steady behaviour during the action; and I take this opportunity\r\n   to recommend to their lordships' notice the three lieutenants,\r\n   Messrs. Parker, Otter, and Rye: their conduct has afforded me\r\n   the utmost satisfaction.\r\n\r\n   I have the honour to be,\r\n   With the greatest respect, sir,\r\n   Your most obedient and very humble servant,\r\n   JAMES SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n   To Philip Stephens, Esq. Admiralty.\r\n\r\n   P.S.--The Reunion was accompanied by a cutter, which did not\r\n   attempt to come into action, but made for Cherbourg.\r\n\r\nCaptain Saumarez was now on his passage to Portsmouth, where he had\r\nleft his wife and infant children only two days before, in pursuit of\r\nan implacable enemy known to be not many leagues distant! It was the\r\nfirst battle he had fought since he became a husband and a father; and\r\nhis feelings, as he returned triumphantly to the bosom of his family,\r\ncan be easier imagined than described.\r\n\r\nThe anxiety and excitement inseparable from the day of battle had\r\nsubsided, the prisoners had been removed, the captive Frenchmen with\r\nwhom he had been sympathizing had retired, and he was at length left\r\nalone to meditate on that remarkable dispensation of Divine favour\r\nwhich had been so fully and especially manifested towards him: he had\r\ngloriously wrested from an enemy, fighting under the proud banner of\r\nliberty, a ship equal to his own in weight of metal and superior by\r\nseventy men in numbers, after a furious contest of above two hours,\r\nwithout a man being hurt by his opponent, who lost one hundred and\r\ntwenty men killed and wounded: a fact unparalleled in the page of\r\nhistory. With the generality of mankind, such circumstances were well\r\ncalculated to raise feelings of proud exultation; but these were never\r\ncherished in the breast of Saumarez. Having done all in his power to\r\nsoothe the affliction of his vanquished enemy, his first impulse was\r\nto offer up his thanksgivings and acknowledgments to the great GIVER\r\nof all victory, and to implore that his mind might not be too highly\r\nelevated by his glorious success. After despatching his unpresuming\r\nletter to the Admiralty, which has been already given, he wrote to his\r\nbrother, in London, the following letter:\r\n\r\n   Crescent, 21st Oct. 1793.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR RICHARD,\r\n\r\n   You will rejoice with me at the success that has attended our\r\n   short cruise. On Saturday evening we sailed from Spithead; and\r\n   the next morning, being about three leagues from Cape Barfleur,\r\n   we saw two sail standing towards us from under Cherbourg, which\r\n   I soon discovered to be a French frigate and a cutter. We were\r\n   on the larboard tack with the wind off shore; I was happy in\r\n   being able to keep between them and the land. When about two\r\n   miles from us, the frigate tacked with all her sail set, and the\r\n   cutter made sail to windward: we edged down to her, and at a\r\n   cable's distance, at half-past ten, began the action, which\r\n   continued with scarcely any intermission two hours and ten\r\n   minutes.\r\n\r\n   Both ships were soon cut up in their sails and rigging, our\r\n   fore-topsail yard being shot away, and soon after the\r\n   fore-top-mast; the ship came to, and wearing on the other tack,\r\n   gave us an opportunity to fire our guns, which were so well\r\n   served that the French ship soon became unmanageable, and\r\n   enabled us to rake her fore and aft; in which situation she\r\n   struck her colours. I must observe that they had been before\r\n   shot away, and, imagining she had struck, I gave orders to cease\r\n   firing; she, however, soon relieved us of our suspense by giving\r\n   us her broadside: we were so well prepared, and kept up so good\r\n   a fire, that in a short time after they waved their colours and\r\n   made signs from the gunwale with their hats that they had\r\n   struck.\r\n\r\n   I immediately sent Mr. Parker to take possession of the ship,\r\n   and send the first and second captains on board the Crescent.\r\n   They informed me that the ship they had surrendered was La\r\n   Reunion, mounting thirty-six guns and three hundred and\r\n   twenty-one men. When we came into action, another frigate was in\r\n   sight to the eastward, which we took to be her consort; we\r\n   therefore lost no time to exchange prisoners, and repair our\r\n   damages, in the best manner we could: she, however, proved to be\r\n   the Circe, and joined us four hours after the action ceased.\r\n\r\n   The circumstance that has made me most happy from this\r\n   engagement is, that we have not had a single person hurt by the\r\n   enemy, and but one man injured, who had his leg fractured by the\r\n   recoil of a gun. There being little wind the sea was perfectly\r\n   calm; and I had the satisfaction to observe that most of our\r\n   shot were perfectly well directed. The enemy's frigate is indeed\r\n   most sadly a wreck, thirty-four men killed and eighty-four\r\n   wounded, many of them mortally; one officer only has suffered,\r\n   being badly wounded. She was commanded by Citizen Denain,\r\n   capitaine de vaisseau, to whose obstinacy they ascribe the\r\n   sacrifice of many lives.\r\n\r\n   It is unnecessary for me to observe, my dear Richard, the great\r\n   happiness I derive from the consciousness that this event will\r\n   afford you and all our friends particular satisfaction. My dear\r\n   Martha, too,--I scarcely know how I shall disclose the\r\n   circumstance to her; it embarrasses me as much as if it were a\r\n   mournful subject. One observation is incumbent on me to make,\r\n   namely, that Captain Yorke used every possible exertion to join\r\n   us sooner, and that he has most readily afforded us every\r\n   assistance we required,\r\n\r\n   I now remain, your ever affectionate brother,\r\n   JAS. SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\nCaptain Saumarez had now realized his ardent desire for an opportunity\r\nof distinguishing himself, such as was afforded to his gallant\r\nbrother-officer of the Nymphe; and it is a singular coincidence that\r\neach should have written to his brother on the day of action, under\r\nsimilar circumstances of triumph and excitement. These interesting\r\ndocuments seem to have decided the superiority of the British over the\r\nFrench navy, at the commencement of the French revolution, and in\r\nreference to that of Saumarez, we cannot but dwell with admiration on\r\nthe humility and acuteness of feeling with which it is replete!\r\n\r\nThe Circe, which had joined four hours after the action, was\r\ndespatched to Guernsey to execute the service on which Captain\r\nSaumarez had been ordered; but the Crescent and her prize, in\r\nproceeding to Spithead, were detained by light winds and calms. On the\r\n22nd, she arrived off the Isle of Wight, when Lieutenant Otter was\r\nsent to Portsmouth in the boat with the following official letter:\r\n\r\n   Crescent, off the Isle of Wight, 22d Oct. 1793.\r\n\r\n   SIR,\r\n\r\n   I BEG you will be pleased to inform my Lords Commissioners of\r\n   the Admiralty, that, being unable to gain Spithead from the\r\n   prevailing calms, I have thought it expedient to despatch\r\n   Lieutenant Otter with the intelligence I have the honour to\r\n   convey to their lordships.\r\n\r\n   Having been prevented by the action with La Reunion from\r\n   complying with their lordships' orders, I directed the Hon.\r\n   Captain Yorke, who joined me in his Majesty's ship Circe, to\r\n   proceed with the pacquets I was charged with for the commanding\r\n   officers of his Majesty's troops at Guernsey and Jersey, and\r\n   from thence to proceed to St. Maloes, and return to Spithead,\r\n   agreeable to their lordships' orders.\r\n\r\n   I beg to observe, that Captain Yorke gave me every possible\r\n   assistance, and has taken one hundred and sixty prisoners from\r\n   the Reunion, which I directed him to land in the island of\r\n   Guernsey.\r\n\r\n   I have the honour to be, sir,\r\n   Your most humble servant,\r\n   JAS. SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n   To Philip Stephens, Esq.\r\n\r\nThe Crescent arrived at Spithead on the following day, and with her\r\nprize was ordered into harbour; the former to have her damages\r\nrepaired, and the latter to be surveyed and purchased for his\r\nMajesty's service.\r\n\r\nBefore we submit the interesting official and private letters which\r\nCaptain Saumarez received on his arrival, and which may be considered\r\nas the best proof of the sensation which this gallant action created,\r\nit becomes our duty to state the comparative force of the two\r\nfrigates.\r\n                                                            Weight\r\n                                                             of\r\n      _Crescent._  No. Size.

The weight has been reduced to English pounds.\r\n\r\nThe Crescent lost her fore-top-mast; her sails and rigging were much\r\ndamaged, but very few shot struck her hull; and the only man hurt was\r\nat the first broadside, when his leg was fractured by the recoil of a\r\ngun.\r\n\r\nLa Reunion, on the contrary, had many shot in her hull, and her stern\r\nwas very much shattered. After she was in dock, we saw where a shot\r\nhad entered the starboard quarter, and made its way out of the\r\nlarboard bow. It was said to have killed and wounded twenty-one men!\r\nThe head of her rudder and wheel were shot away, and the fore-yard and\r\nmain-topsail-yard came down early in the action: she was, in short, a\r\ncomplete wreck, as represented in the plate. The hopes that the ship\r\nseen to the eastward under the land was a friend, induced the French\r\ncaptain to delay surrendering after defence could no longer be\r\neffectual.\r\n\r\nThe head-money was only paid for three hundred men; but there was no\r\ndoubt that three hundred and twenty-one were on board at the\r\ncommencement of the action, as many of the slain were thrown\r\noverboard, and the French officers, for obvious reasons, wished to\r\nmake their force less than it was. According to Captains Tancock and\r\nMansell, forty men were killed, and eighty wounded. The cutter which\r\nwas in company, believed to be L'Esperance, mounting fourteen guns,\r\nmade off for Cherbourg with sweeps and sails as soon as the firing\r\ncommenced. La Reunion's consort, believed to be the Semillante, made\r\nan attempt to get out of Cherbourg, but was prevented by the tide,\r\nwhen she sent a boat full of men, it was supposed, to reinforce the\r\nformer, but which returned when it was observed that her fate was\r\ndecided. The French shore, only five miles distant, was crowded with\r\nspectators.\r\n\r\nThere is no action between two single ships on record, where\r\nconsummate skill in naval tactics has been so brilliantly and\r\nsuccessfully displayed as in that which we have just described. The\r\npatriotic reader must not imagine that, because the Crescent had\r\n\"none\" either killed or wounded, the captain and officers of La\r\nReunion did not do their utmost, and far less that they were deficient\r\nin courage. The severe loss they sustained, and the obstinacy with\r\nwhich their ship was defended, has fully proved their bravery. Had the\r\nCrescent at once boarded the Reunion, which was in her power, and\r\ncarried her sword in hand, as in the case of the Nymphe and Cleopatre,\r\nit would have been perhaps better calculated to excite feelings of\r\nadmiration in the general reader, who is not acquainted with naval\r\naffairs; but this mode of attack is one which, we must acquaint them,\r\nmight readily be made by any officer moderately skilled in naval\r\ntactics. It is where the commander of a ship, by his presence of mind\r\nand skilful manoeuvring, succeeds in the defeat and capture of an\r\nenemy, that the superiority is manifest; and it is to him who has thus\r\nproved that he possesses the _tact_ to accomplish his object, and yet\r\nspare the valuable lives of his men, that the meed of praise is most\r\njustly due.\r\n\r\n   Crescent, Spithead, 23rd October 1793.\r\n\r\n   SIR,\r\n\r\n   I beg you will be pleased to inform my Lords Commissioners of\r\n   the Admiralty of my arrival at Spithead in H.M. ship Crescent,\r\n   under my command, and the prize La Reunion, and from thence into\r\n   Portsmouth Harbour, conformable with orders from Sir Peter\r\n   Parker.\r\n\r\n   I have the honour to be,\r\n   Your obedient humble servant,\r\n   JAMES SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n   To Philip Stephens, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Admiralty, October 24th, 1793.\r\n\r\n   SIR,\r\n\r\n   I learnt yesterday with great satisfaction the account of your\r\n   action with the French frigate La Reunion, and beg to\r\n   congratulate you very sincerely on your success on this\r\n   occasion. The greatest praise seems due to the bravery and good\r\n   conduct of the officers and men of the Crescent. I shall be\r\n   extremely happy, as soon as it is convenient to you, to have the\r\n   pleasure of seeing you in town, and of presenting you to his\r\n   Majesty on an occasion so highly honourable to you. I am, sir,\r\n\r\n   Your very faithful humble servant,\r\n   CHATHAM.\r\n   (First Lord of the Admiralty.)\r\n\r\n   To Captain Saumarez.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Admiralty, 24th October 1793.\r\n\r\n   DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n   I was this morning so happy as to receive your letter, conveying\r\n   the agreeable account of your having captured the French frigate\r\n   La Reunion, and which I lost no time in communicating to Lord\r\n   Chatham, who will himself express to you his very high sense of\r\n   your distinguished conduct, as well as his great satisfaction at\r\n   the account you have given of the exemplary and gallant\r\n   behaviour of your officers and men. I beg, my dear sir, to\r\n   congratulate you most sincerely on an event which adds such\r\n   lustre to your professional character, at the same time that it\r\n   entitles you to every reward from your country, and\r\n\r\n   I remain, with great regard,\r\n   Your very faithful\r\n   and obedient humble servant,\r\n   J. HUNT.\r\n   (Private Secretary.)\r\n\r\n   To Captain Saumarez, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n   St. James's-square, 24th October 1793.\r\n\r\n   SIR,\r\n\r\n   Lord Chatham was so obliging as to acquaint me yesterday with\r\n   your success, and at the same time with his fullest approbation\r\n   of your conduct, which you may be assured gave me great\r\n   pleasure. I have this day the favour of your letter, and thank\r\n   you for your kind attention in informing me of what you might be\r\n   confident would give me particular satisfaction.\r\n\r\n   I am, with great regard, sir,\r\n   Your obedient humble servant,\r\n   AMHERST.\r\n\r\n   To Captain James Saumarez.\r\n\r\n\r\n   FROM THE REV. R.B. NICHOLLS.\r\n   28th October 1793, Middleham, Yorkshire.\r\n\r\n   DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n   Accept my warmest congratulations on your late very\r\n   extraordinary and glorious success, which I consider as a signal\r\n   favour and blessing upon you from the God of armies, whom I\r\n   invoke, and shall ever, on your behalf, that the path of\r\n   happiness and glory, temporal and eternal, may be successfully\r\n   trodden by you, and that you may long live an example of the\r\n   blessings that Heaven has for a Cornelius. Continue me in your\r\n   friendly remembrance, which I shall ever consider as an honour.\r\n\r\n   I am, dear sir,\r\n   Your most affectionate\r\n   and most obedient humble servant,\r\n   R.B. NICHOLLS.\r\n\r\n   To Captain Saumarez, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Portsmouth, 30th October 1793.\r\n\r\n   DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n   I am infinitely obliged to you for your kindness and attention\r\n   to George Parker. I have not as yet heard from Lord Chatham, but\r\n   suppose I shall in a day or two. This morning I reckon you will\r\n   kiss hands, and return home \"Sir James.\" Such an honour obtained\r\n   on such an occasion is worthy the solicitation of a duke. If\r\n   anything material occurs, be so good to favour me with a line.\r\n   Lady Parker unites in every good wish for your rib and yourself,\r\n   with\r\n\r\n   Yours, most sincerely,\r\n   P. PARKER.\r\n\r\n   To Captain Saumarez.\r\n\r\nCaptain Saumarez, after a happy visit to his family at Ryde, repaired\r\nto London, on leave of absence; and, on being presented to his\r\nMajesty, received the well-merited honour of knighthood, and his first\r\nlieutenant (now Admiral Sir) George Parker, was promoted to the rank\r\nof master and commander. Sir James, having applied for an extension of\r\nhis leave, enjoyed the society of his friends in London until the\r\n14th of November, when he and Lady Saumarez returned to their family\r\nat Ryde. The following letter to his brother, descriptive of other\r\nmarks of respect which had been paid to him, will be read with\r\ninterest:\r\n\r\n   Ryde, Isle of Wight, 16th Nov. 1793.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n   It was not before yesterday that we were enabled to return to\r\n   our little treasure in this island, owing to official business\r\n   and the badness of the weather. We found all in perfect good\r\n   health except our little girl, who has been for some time very\r\n   unwell, and has suffered exceedingly; she is at present rather\r\n   better, and we hope her disorder is past its height. Mr. Le\r\n   Marchant has fixed for next Monday to leave the island. I shall\r\n   endeavour to accompany them to Southampton, and, after that,\r\n   trust to opportunities hereafter offering to enable me to see\r\n   them at Bath.\r\n\r\n   I do not expect the Crescent will be ready to leave the harbour\r\n   before the middle of next week; what our destination will then\r\n   be must remain uncertain. Sir John Jarvis has this morning made\r\n   the signal for sailing, and it is expected will put to sea on\r\n   Monday or Tuesday next. I mean to return to Portsmouth to-day or\r\n   to-morrow, that I may have an opportunity of seeing General\r\n   Dundas before his departure.\r\n\r\n   Our last letters from the island (Guernsey) are of the 6th; no\r\n   particular news. You will be concerned to hear of the fate of\r\n   the unlucky Thames; when the particulars are received, I am\r\n   persuaded it will be found that the ship has not been given\r\n   away. The report is, that, after a severe action with a\r\n   six-and-thirty, she was next day attacked by the Carmagniolle,\r\n   to which ship she struck. Sir E. Pellew is cruising with the\r\n   Circe off St. Maloes; the French have no ships at present at\r\n   Cherbourg.\r\n\r\n   Yesterday I received a very polite letter from Mr. Marsham,\r\n   inclosing the resolution of the 14th instant from the committee\r\n   for encouraging the capture of French privateers, voting me a\r\n   piece of plate, value one hundred guineas, which I consider a\r\n   very high compliment paid to my earnest endeavours. But I am not\r\n   quite so well pleased with a letter from Mr. Cooke, who has the\r\n   distribution of the fees which he says are due from those who\r\n   receive the honour of knighthood, and which amount to 103_l._\r\n   6_s._ 8_d._ In reply to this, I have referred him to whoever\r\n   paid the above fees for Sir E. Pellew, on whom that honour was\r\n   conferred on a similar occasion. I fear it may not be taken\r\n   well; at the same time, I think it hard to pay so much for an\r\n   honour which my services have been thought to deserve.\r\n\r\n   Captain Parker came down to Portsmouth last Thursday, without\r\n   having obtained an interview with Lord Chatham. I am, however,\r\n   persuaded he will soon get a ship. The other arrangements are\r\n   not yet made. Mr. Warren has gone to London, to endeavour to get\r\n   over the difficulty of not having served his rated time; if he\r\n   does, he is to be third lieutenant.\r\n\r\n   You must now permit me to return you and my dear sister our most\r\n   sincere thanks for the kind hospitality we experienced under\r\n   your roof; we not only ate of your board and drank of your cup,\r\n   but you gave us your very bed to repose on: when shall we have\r\n   it in our power to requite such goodness? At any rate, receive\r\n   this tribute of our warmest gratitude.\r\n\r\n   I hope your dear children, whom we almost considered as ours,\r\n   are very well: bestow on them a thousand kisses from us. With\r\n   our most sincere love, I remain, my dear brother,\r\n\r\n   Ever affectionately yours,\r\n   JAS. SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of November, the Crescent came out of harbour, and was\r\nreported ready for sea; and Sir James Saumarez was now ready to\r\nproceed, and to add fresh laurels to those he had so gloriously gained\r\nin the service of his king and country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n1793, 1794.\r\n\r\n   Sir James Saumarez is placed under the orders of Admiral\r\n   McBride.--Is detached, and attacks an Enemy's squadron.--Narrow\r\n   Escape from Shipwreck.--Off Havre.--Cherbourg.--Private Letters\r\n   relating the particulars of several Cruises on the French\r\n   coast.--Gallant Action with a French squadron of superior force\r\n   off Guernsey.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir James was now placed under the orders of Admiral McBride, who gave\r\nhim the command of a squadron, consisting of the Crescent and Druid,\r\nfrigates, Liberty brig, and Lion cutter. The first service he had to\r\nperform was to carry a small convoy of transports with troops, &c. to\r\nGuernsey and Jersey, and furthermore to obtain pilots for the\r\nadmiral's squadron.\r\n\r\nWe shall not attempt to describe the enthusiastic reception which Sir\r\nJames and his gallant crew received from their loyal and patriotic\r\ncountrymen in these islands; but his stay was short. Despatching the\r\nLiberty to reconnoitre St. Maloes, he proceeded to Jersey, and, having\r\nreconnoitred Granville, returned to Guernsey Roads on the 28th of\r\nNovember, when he detached the Lion with pilots to the admiral; and,\r\npursuant to orders, sailed to the adjacent coast of France to assist\r\nthe royalists.\r\n\r\nThe following is his account of an attempt to attack a French squadron\r\nin the bay of Brehat.\r\n\r\n   Crescent, off Guernsey, 7th Dec. 1793.\r\n\r\n   SIR,\r\n\r\n   I have the honour to acquaint you, that pursuant to your orders\r\n   I sailed from Guernsey Roads the night of the 5th instant, in\r\n   his Majesty's ship Crescent, under my command, together with the\r\n   Druid frigate and Liberty brig. The wind being to the southward,\r\n   we were unable to fetch to windward off Cape Frehel in the\r\n   morning; and observing several sail at anchor off the isles of\r\n   Brehat, particularly two large ships and a brig, in a bay to the\r\n   northward, which there appeared a great probability of attacking\r\n   with success, I stood in for them; but the tide of ebb setting\r\n   us to the westward, prevented our fetching into the bay, and\r\n   enabled the enemy's ships to get under way with the first of the\r\n   flood, and save themselves between the rocks. We were however in\r\n   time to fire several shot at the largest, which, as well as the\r\n   others, appeared armed _en flute_ and deeply laden.\r\n\r\n   Finding it impossible to follow them without endangering his\r\n   Majesty's ships, I stood out of the bay through a passage which\r\n   both the pilots I had on board assured me was perfectly safe.\r\n\r\n   We soon found ourselves deceived, perceiving several rocks which\r\n   we with difficulty cleared. Unfortunately the Druid, (which I\r\n   hailed to acquaint her of the danger,) in wearing, tailed on a\r\n   sunken rock; and, although she floated in a few minutes, she has\r\n   I fear received so much damage as to require her to be taken\r\n   into dock.\r\n\r\n   I have directed Captain Ellison, whose activity and exertions\r\n   cannot be too highly praised, to proceed to Plymouth, and the\r\n   Liberty to accompany him into the Sound, and rejoin you without\r\n   loss of time.\r\n\r\n   I am, with every respect, sir,\r\n   Your obedient and most humble servant,\r\n   JAS. SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n   Rear-admiral John McBride.\r\n\r\nOn Sir James's arrival at Guernsey, he addressed the following letter\r\nto his brother in London, which continues the narrative of his\r\nproceedings on that dangerous coast.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR RICHARD,\r\n\r\n   I take the first opportunity to send you an account of an\r\n   enterprise which, had it been attended with success, would have\r\n   proved fortunate indeed. Not having time to send you the\r\n   particulars, I have enclosed a copy of my letter to the admiral,\r\n   which you will show to M. Le Mesurier. I have only to add, that\r\n   the object in view justified the attempt; but, as the world too\r\n   often forms its judgment from events, I fear we shall not\r\n   acquire much credit for the attempt.\r\n\r\n   At midnight, we providentially escaped getting wrecked on the\r\n   Rocks Douvre, in steering after the Druid. We were warned of our\r\n   perilous situation by the noise of the breakers, and had only\r\n   time to avoid them. In short, my dear friend, when I consider\r\n   our disappointment, and the very wonderful escapes we have had,\r\n   it is almost too much for me, and I can only be thankful things\r\n   are not worse.\r\n\r\n   Accounts have lately arrived from the army of the royalists,\r\n   that they are in possession of Rennes, and we have reason to\r\n   expect soon to hear of their having a seaport wherein we can\r\n   land the reinforcement. Four French frigates have been in sight\r\n   of the island these two days; the more mortifying as we cannot\r\n   detach after them without leaving the troops embarked\r\n   unprotected. An expedition of this consequence should have at\r\n   least the support of two ships of the line.\r\n\r\n   Be careful that nothing that I write to you transpires. I have\r\n   lately seen paragraphs which have given me concern, particularly\r\n   one mentioning my being ordered off St. Maloes. Be assured they\r\n   may occasion much mischief and distrust, if it can be imagined\r\n   that they originate from any of my friends. My brother has shown\r\n   me the P.S. of your letter to him: I think it best the plate\r\n   should be confined to a dinner-set, as I am unwilling to\r\n   separate the whole of a present so handsomely bestowed;\r\n   therefore, if not too late, I wish you to direct accordingly.\r\n   Lady S. writes to me that our dear little girl is better; I wish\r\n   to hear that she is sufficiently well to be inoculated. I shall\r\n   be happy to have it over.\r\n\r\n   You are a long time without writing to me. Although I know you\r\n   are most hurried at this time, you must forgive me if I desire\r\n   you will devote a few spare minutes to me; my sister, I am sure,\r\n   will consent to it. Assure her of my sincere love; and believe\r\n   me truly,\r\n   My dear Richard,\r\n\r\n   Yours affectionately,\r\n   JAMES SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n   P.S.--We are close ship-keepers, being all on board by six\r\n   o'clock; a very proper regulation. I do not expect to sail\r\n   before the fleet proceeds to the French coast, when I hope our\r\n   accounts will prove more favourable.\r\n\r\nWe have here two other remarkable instances, where on sudden and\r\nunexpected danger appearing, the presence of mind and professional\r\nskill of Saumarez saved his ship and squadron from destruction; and\r\nalthough the bold attempt he made to attack the enemy was\r\nunsuccessful, he does not less deserve the merit of making it, for we\r\ncannot command the wind and tide.\r\n\r\nThe Crescent continued to cruise with Admiral McBride's squadron\r\nduring the winter, making several attempts to assist the royalists on\r\nvarious places on the coast of France, and annoying the enemy's\r\ncoasting trade.\r\n\r\nThe following letters from Sir James to his brother in London, give a\r\nparticular account, in his own words, of the arduous services on which\r\nhe was employed during that time.\r\n\r\n   Crescent, Cowes Roads, 25th January 1794.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR RICHARD,\r\n\r\n   You will not expect so soon to hear from me, but I must just\r\n   give you a journal of our short cruise. The day after we sailed\r\n   from here, we chased three armed brigs off Havre, which were\r\n   very near captured by the Flora and this ship. The day\r\n   following, Sir John Warren having detached me and La Nymphe to\r\n   look into Cherbourg, on the very spot where La Reunion fell into\r\n   our hands, we were on the point of taking a French frigate,\r\n   apparently of twenty-eight or thirty-two guns. The wind at first\r\n   flattered us with the hope of cutting her off from the land,\r\n   when it shifted and enabled her to get into Cherbourg: they were\r\n   decidedly frightened, and kept firing guns as signals to their\r\n   ships in the bay, which never attempted to come out to their\r\n   assistance, although we were alone, as La Nymphe was scarcely\r\n   discernible from this ship. The next day La Nymphe sprung her\r\n   fore-mast, which obliged her to return to Spithead.\r\n\r\n   I appeared close to Cherbourg all day yesterday, in the hope of\r\n   drawing their ships out, which I plainly discerned to consist of\r\n   six frigates, four of which were large. In the evening it coming\r\n   on to blow hard, and no appearance of our ships, I stood off\r\n   shore, and at noon this day, it blowing a severe storm, I\r\n   anchored in this road. Admiral McBride having consented to my\r\n   going to Bath for twenty-four hours, I am setting off with all\r\n   speed: not having time to add more, I remain, with my kindest\r\n   love,\r\n   My dear Richard,\r\n\r\n   Yours ever affectionately,\r\n   JAS. SAUMAREZ.\r\n   Sunday Morning.\r\n\r\n   P.S.--I really intended to write to the Lord Mayor, but have not\r\n   a moment's time; I shall therefore leave you to acquaint him\r\n   with our return here.\r\n\r\nWe may stop here to mention, that in the debate in the House of\r\nCommons on the address to the King's speech at the opening of\r\nparliament, the gallant conduct of Sir James Saumarez was mentioned in\r\nterms of admiration, and his late action quoted as a remarkable\r\ninstance of the superiority of our naval commanders in professional\r\ntalent and skill; the account of this had been transmitted to him from\r\nLondon by his brother Richard.\r\n\r\n   Cowes, 2nd February 1794.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR RICHARD,\r\n\r\n   I left my dearest concerns yesterday morning, and arrived here\r\n   this afternoon, after a six hours' storm, from Southampton.\r\n   Both your kind letters afford me infinite satisfaction. When I\r\n   wrote to you on Sunday, I had not the admiral's consent to\r\n   remain till I heard from him, and only expected to remain\r\n   twenty-four hours in Bath; but depended, nevertheless, on\r\n   hearing from you there. You must therefore desire my sister to\r\n   plead in your behalf, when she writes to Lady S.\r\n\r\n   I am much flattered at my name having been found worthy of\r\n   notice in the House of Commons, and I thank you for the praise\r\n   you bestow on me for the business of our last cruise. Though we\r\n   failed in taking the frigate, it was certainly a matter of\r\n   exultation and triumph to me, in a single ship, thus to brave\r\n   the enemy off their port.\r\n\r\n   I find Sir John Warren has sent in an armed brig, which we were\r\n   prevented from sharing, at the time we were in pursuit of the\r\n   frigate: we decoyed her to within a small distance from us by\r\n   showing French colours, and I am persuaded we should have taken\r\n   her, if we had chased her instead of the frigate; and they ought\r\n   in justice to allow us to share in the profits of this prize.\r\n\r\n   I would advise you to wait till Donaldson's plates come out for\r\n   your paintings. Let me caution you against purchasing any of the\r\n   prints, as I have engaged fifteen sets for my friends, in order\r\n   to have proof engravings.\r\n\r\n   Tom[7] writes to me they are under serious apprehensions for the\r\n   island. I own to you I think there is some cause, unless we keep\r\n   a strong squadron for their defence; at the same time, I do not\r\n   believe they have so strong a force as mentioned, or that they\r\n   are making preparation for invading this country. Let me know\r\n   what has become of Mr. Warren, and whether Captain Parker has\r\n   sailed.\r\n\r\n   I must now wish you and my sister, and all under your roof, a\r\n   good night. And\r\n\r\n   I remain truly,\r\n   Yours affectionately,\r\n   Monday morning.\r\n   JAS. SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n   P.S.--Our admiral has not yet made his appearance, a vessel is\r\n   gone to Portsmouth for him. The packet returns so speedily that\r\n   it is next to impossible to answer letters the same day.\r\n\r\n   [7] Sir James's brother.\r\n\r\n   Crescent, Spithead, 24th February 1794.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR RICHARD,\r\n\r\n   You will be pleased to hear of our being safe in port in the\r\n   midst of the prevailing storms, but not without our having\r\n   previously felt their rigour. Last Thursday morning we carried\r\n   away our main-top-mast; and, in going to Torbay soon after, we\r\n   sprung our fore-yard, which made the admiral determine to send\r\n   us to Spithead to refit, and afterwards join him with all\r\n   possible despatch. We are just anchored; but it blows so very\r\n   hard, there is no possibility of sending a boat on shore.\r\n\r\n   I left the squadron anchored in Torbay yesterday evening, where\r\n   they are well sheltered from the present very high wind. Let me\r\n   hear from you, if possible, by the next post. Not expecting to\r\n   be ordered here, I wrote to Lady S. yesterday morning, desiring\r\n   her to direct to me there; and would have written to you to the\r\n   same purpose, but that I expected to have sent my letters from\r\n   here by this evening's post, which would have reached you\r\n   equally soon.\r\n\r\n   I think this weather will, for the present at least, let us\r\n   sleep in tranquillity, and make our enemies set aside their\r\n   projected invasion. Let them attempt it when they will, I shall\r\n   view it as a desirable event for this country. But I am not of\r\n   that opinion with regard to our islands.\r\n\r\n   God bless you, and preserve them all! Let us deserve well, and\r\n   there is nothing that we may not confidently expect from his\r\n   providence. And, with my sincere love,\r\n\r\n   I am ever affectionately yours,\r\n   JAS. SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n   P.S. Sunday morning.--I availed myself of a favourable time this\r\n   morning to come on shore, and have just received a letter\r\n   stating that the Liberty had been chased by two frigates off the\r\n   Casketts.\r\n\r\nThe following letter gives an account of his visit to the island of\r\nJersey, &c.\r\n\r\n   Bouley Bay, Jersey, 30th March 1794.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR RICHARD,\r\n\r\n   I have at length had an opportunity of visiting this island, the\r\n   admiral having detached this ship and the Druid to look into\r\n   Cancalle Bay and Granville. It falling calm on Thursday evening,\r\n   we anchored in St. Owen's Bay; and, next morning, Captain\r\n   Ellison and myself went on shore to wait on Lord Balcarras. We\r\n   called on Mr. Dumaresq on our way to St. Hilliers, who most\r\n   obligingly assisted us with horses, and accompanied us to town\r\n   after having engaged us to dinner. I had just time to call on\r\n   our friends John Durell and Mr. Wm. Dumaresq, who were very kind\r\n   in their offers of service. We then returned to St. Peter's, and\r\n   I shall ever be thankful for one of the most pleasant days I\r\n   have passed since I commanded the Crescent. Lord Balcarras and\r\n   his aides-de-camp were the only strangers; Major and Mrs. Le\r\n   Couteur were of the party; and they were all to have favoured me\r\n   with their company on board the following day, had not untoward\r\n   circumstances prevented that pleasure. In the evening we had so\r\n   thick a fog that it was impossible to join the ships; and at\r\n   day-break we had the mortification to find, that, the wind\r\n   having come to the southward, they had found it necessary to\r\n   leave the bay. They however soon made their appearance, and with\r\n   some difficulty I got on board.\r\n\r\n   The weather not permitting our going on the French coast, I\r\n   anchored in this bay, and detached a lugger with the third\r\n   lieutenant, which will execute the service better than we could\r\n   in the ships. They are here greatly relieved from their fears by\r\n   knowing our squadron is so near them; and the ladies that at\r\n   first emigrated are now returning. Write to me by the packet to\r\n   Guernsey.\r\n\r\n   When we can ascertain the force at Cancalle, I hope we shall\r\n   find ourselves of sufficient strength to pay them a visit. If\r\n   the emissaries are to be credited, they are disembarking their\r\n   troops, and marching against the royalists in La Vendee.\r\n\r\n   I hope my sister continues well, as when I left you. And, with\r\n   kindest love,\r\n\r\n   I remain, yours ever affectionately,\r\n   JAS. SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n   Sunday evening.--P.S. Mr. French, third lieutenant, is this\r\n   moment returned. He reports that eleven sail of frigates are in\r\n   Cancalle Bay only;--not the least appearance of ships of the\r\n   line.\r\n\r\nAfter remaining some time on this dangerous station, the Crescent and\r\nsquadron returned to Plymouth, when Sir James Saumarez was employed on\r\nthe expedition under Earl Moira, which need not be detailed here. On\r\nthe 11th May he received orders to take a squadron under his command,\r\nto cruise off the Lizard. The following letter is relative to this\r\ncruise:\r\n\r\n   Crescent, at sea, 14th May, 1794.\r\n\r\n   SIR,\r\n\r\n   Pursuant to your directions, I dispatch the Mary cutter to\r\n   Plymouth for any orders you may be pleased to send me, and I\r\n   avail myself of this opportunity to acquaint you with the\r\n   proceedings of the squadron from the time of our departure.\r\n\r\n   We made sail to the southward on Sunday night, and saw nothing\r\n   except two neutral vessels. One of them was informed by Sir\r\n   Richard Strachan, that on the 6th instant he fell in with a\r\n   squadron of French frigates in lat. 47 deg. 50' N., long. 6 deg. 15' W.\r\n\r\n   Yesterday morning, about eighteen leagues to the southward of\r\n   the Lizard, the weather having proved hazy, on clearing up we\r\n   saw a ship and a brig, which we soon distinguished to be enemy's\r\n   cruisers. I made the signal for general chase, and endeavoured\r\n   to cut them off from the French coast. We pursued them till\r\n   within four miles of Ushant, when they escaped through the\r\n   passage De Four. I then made the best of my way to regain the\r\n   station; and we are now anxiously looking for the frigates we\r\n   sailed in pursuit of, with the hopes of better success.\r\n\r\n   I beg to assure you of my most earnest endeavours to merit the\r\n   confidence you are pleased to repose in me; being, with great\r\n   truth,\r\n   My dear Admiral,\r\n\r\n   Your most faithful\r\n   and obedient servant,\r\n   JAS. SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n   To Admiral McBride, Plymouth.\r\n\r\nIt was in the interval between December 1793 and June 1794, that Sir\r\nJames Saumarez and Sir Edward Pellew, and Sir John Warren, being each\r\nin command of squadrons of frigates, agreed to share prize-money until\r\nthe latter should return to port, which did not take place until June.\r\nIt is notorious in the navy that this led to a dispute, and\r\nconsequently a coolness, between these gallant officers, but the\r\nmisunderstanding was subsequently made up, and need not be farther\r\nalluded to.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st June Captain Saumarez returned to Plymouth from the coast\r\nof France adjacent to the Channel islands, and on the 6th received the\r\nfollowing order from Admiral McBride.\r\n\r\n   You are hereby required and directed to take under your command\r\n   his Majesty's ships, luggers, and cutters, named on the\r\n   margin,[8] and proceed first with them to Guernsey and Jersey,\r\n   and then endeavour to ascertain the force the enemy may have in\r\n   Cancalle Bay and St. Maloes, and then return to Cawsand Bay,\r\n   leaving the Prestwood cutter with Captain Ball, of his Majesty's\r\n   ship Fury.\r\n\r\n   Given under my hand, on board\r\n   H.M.S. Echo, 6th June 1794.\r\n   JNO. McBRIDE.\r\n\r\n   [8] Druid, Valiant, Dolphin, Cockchafer, Active, and Prestwood.\r\n\r\nSir James sailed on the 7th from Plymouth: the following is a copy of\r\nhis official letter, giving an account of his action with the French\r\nsquadron:\r\n\r\n   Crescent, Guernsey, 8th June 1794.\r\n\r\n   SIR,\r\n\r\n   I have the honour to acquaint you that this morning, at dawn of\r\n   day, being with his Majesty's ship Crescent, under my command,\r\n   and the Druid and Eurydice frigates, about twelve leagues to the\r\n   northward of Guernsey, on the larboard tack, with a fresh breeze\r\n   to the N.E., we fell in with five sail of ships and a cutter to\r\n   windward. From their not bearing down, and other circumstances,\r\n   I did not take them for enemy's ships; and I directed Lieut.\r\n   Baker, of the Valiant, armed lugger, to make sail to windward,\r\n   for the purpose of reconnoitring them. At six o'clock they\r\n   hoisted national colours, and fired on the lugger. I then\r\n   shortened sail to form the line; but the Eurydice sailing so\r\n   indifferently, and having so superior a force to contend\r\n   with,--three of the enemy's ships being large frigates, with\r\n   another which I took for the Thames, and one apparently of\r\n   twenty-four guns,--I directed Captain Cole to make all the sail\r\n   he could and stand in shore, Guernsey at the time being in\r\n   sight.[9]\r\n\r\n     [9] See Engraving.\r\n\r\n   I remained with this ship and the Druid under easy sail to\r\n   windward. The two headmost ships of the enemy kept up a brisk\r\n   fire as they came up; which was returned, but at too great a\r\n   distance to do any considerable damage. At eight, the Eurydice\r\n   being so far in shore as to run no risk of their coming up with\r\n   her, and the whole French line coming up within gun-shot, I made\r\n   sail with the Druid for the Hanoways.\r\n\r\n   Observing the headmost of the enemy gaining very fast on the two\r\n   ships, I hauled in for the shore with the view of drawing off\r\n   her attention; which answered my purpose, as she immediately\r\n   hauled up after me, and maintained a brisk fire for some time,\r\n   but without effect. She then bore away, but the Druid and\r\n   Eurydice were too far ahead; and soon after they hauled their\r\n   wind to the northward.\r\n\r\n   I feel every satisfaction in acquainting you that, from the\r\n   spirit and bravery of my officers and men on this occasion, I am\r\n   persuaded it would have had every effect, had we had a more\r\n   equal force to contend with. I met with a noble support in\r\n   Captain Ellison; and I have only to regret that Captain Cole was\r\n   not in a ship of sufficient force to allow of my deriving\r\n   advantage from his tact and intrepidity.\r\n\r\n   I am, with every respect, sir,\r\n   Your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n   JAS. SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n   Rear-Admiral John McBride.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELATIVE FORCE OF THE ENGLISH AND FRENCH SQUADRONS.\r\n\r\n   _English._\r\n\r\n\r\n                Guns.  Weight of shot.\r\n     Crescent     36    630\r\n     Druid        36    630\r\n     Eurydice     20    240\r\n                  ----------\r\n     Total        92   1500\r\n\r\n   The cutters and luggers went off to Plymouth when the action\r\n   began.\r\n\r\n   _French._\r\n\r\n                                Guns.

The superiority of the enemy being\r\nmuch too great to be opposed with any chance of success, it became the\r\nimperative duty of Saumarez to effect, if possible, the escape of his\r\nships, to which the enemy immediately gave chase. Observing that his\r\nown ship and the Druid had the advantage in sailing, and that the\r\nEurydice, which was not only in bad condition but a bad sailer, would\r\nfall into their hands, he shortened sail, and having ordered the\r\nEurydice by signal to push for Guernsey, he contrived, by occasionally\r\nshowing a disposition to engage, to amuse the enemy, and lead him off\r\nuntil the Eurydice was safe. He now tacked, and, in order to save the\r\nDruid, closed with the enemy, passing along their line; and the\r\ncapture of the Crescent seemed at one time inevitable. The Druid\r\nmeanwhile made her escape, with the Eurydice, into Guernsey Roads.\r\n\r\nBut Sir James Saumarez had for his own preservation a scheme which, in\r\nthe first instance, required great courage; in the second, a perfect\r\nknowledge of a most dangerous and intricate channel; and, in the last,\r\na consummate skill in the management of his ship. He was himself well\r\nacquainted with the coast, and possessed an experienced pilot, John\r\nBreton, a native, whose house was on that extremity of the island. As\r\nsoon therefore as the other two ships were secure, he bore up as if to\r\nrun his ship on the rocks, to avoid capture. Ordering his pilot to\r\nsteer the Crescent through a narrow passage between the rocks, which\r\nhad never before been attempted by a ship of her size, and defying the\r\nenemy to follow him, he reached the anchorage in safety,[10] to the no\r\nsmall surprise and mortification of the French, who, after firing some\r\ntime over the rocks at the ship, were obliged, by the shot of the\r\nCrescent and that of the batteries, to give up the contest.\r\n\r\n   [10] See Engraving and Diagram.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark that, after passing through the narrow channel,\r\nthe ship had to sail so near to the shore of Catel parish, that he\r\ncould distinctly see his own house,--a position truly singular, for\r\nbehind he beheld a French prison, and before him his own fireside!\r\nWhile passing through the narrowest part of the channel, Sir James\r\nasked the pilot if he was sure he could see the marks for running\r\nthrough? when he replied, \"I am quite sure, for there is _your_ house,\r\nand there is my own!\"\r\n\r\nThe gratification which Sir James must have felt in having, by\r\nhis admirable skill and daring, so completely succeeded in saving\r\nthe whole of the ships, could not but be highly augmented by\r\nthe circumstance of his countrymen, and even his family and\r\nfriends, being eye-witnesses of his gallant and judicious conduct.\r\nLieutenant-governor Small, who, with a multitude of the inhabitants,\r\nbeheld the whole of these masterly evolutions, immediately published\r\nthe following flattering testimonial in his general orders, which was\r\nafterwards transmitted to Sir James by the brigade-major in a polite\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n   Parole, _Saumarez_; countersign, _Crescent._\r\n\r\n   The lieutenant-governor cannot, without doing injustice to his\r\n   own feelings, help taking notice thus publicly of the gallant\r\n   and distinguished conduct of Sir James Saumarez, with the\r\n   officers and men of his Majesty's ships Crescent, Druid, and\r\n   Eurydice, under his command, in the very unequal conflict of\r\n   yesterday, where their consummate professional skill and\r\n   masterly manoeuvres demonstrated with brilliant effect the\r\n   superiority of British seamanship and bravery, by repelling and\r\n   frustrating the views of at least treble their force and weight\r\n   of metal.\r\n\r\n   This cheering instance of spirit and perseverance in a\r\n   detachment of our royal navy, could not fail of presenting an\r\n   animating and pleasing example to his Majesty's land forces,\r\n   both of the line and island troops, who were anxious spectators,\r\n   and beheld with admiration the active conduct of their brave\r\n   countrymen.\r\n\r\n   To the loyal inhabitants of Guernsey it afforded cause of real\r\n   exultation to witness the manly and excellent conduct of an\r\n   officer of whom this flourishing island has to boast he is a\r\n   native.\r\n\r\nThe governor of Guernsey, as a further mark of admiration at the\r\ngallant conduct of Sir James Saumarez, wrote the following letter to\r\nthe Secretary of the Admiralty:\r\n\r\n   Government-house, Guernsey, 9th June 1794.\r\n\r\n   SIR,\r\n\r\n   I do myself the honour of transmitting herewith a copy of what I\r\n   deemed proper to insert this day in the public orders issued to\r\n   his Majesty's forces stationed on the island of Guernsey, under\r\n   my command. May I request that this tribute of well-earned\r\n   approbation from a brother officer may be communicated to the\r\n   Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty. Should it appear irregular\r\n   that an extra-official communication of this nature comes from a\r\n   department not immediately under their lordships' cognizance,\r\n   the impropriety on my part I trust will be indulgently forgiven,\r\n   as it arises from an irresistible impulse of wishing to do\r\n   justice to merit and exertions far indeed above my praise. As an\r\n   officer honoured with a public and confidential situation, and\r\n   having from shore been an eye-witness of the gallant intrepidity\r\n   of Sir James Saumarez, and sailors of his Majesty's ships\r\n   Crescent, Druid, and Eurydice, under his command, I consider it\r\n   my duty to express, although still inadequately, my opinion of\r\n   the conduct of men whose modesty (the infallible concomitant of\r\n   merit) may, in reporting to you, come short of what thousands of\r\n   loyal and anxious spectators from this island beheld with joy\r\n   and satisfaction, in the display of superior address and British\r\n   bravery alluded to.\r\n\r\n   I have the honour to subscribe myself,\r\n   With esteem and high regard, sir,\r\n   Your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n   JOHN SMALL.\r\n\r\n   To Philip Stephens, Esq. &c. &c. &c.\r\n\r\n   N.B. The enclosure has been already given.\r\n\r\nThe following general memorandum was issued to the squadron, dated\r\n\r\n   Crescent, Guernsey Roads, 9th June 1794.\r\n\r\n   General Memorandum.\r\n\r\n   Sir James Saumarez desires to return his best thanks to Captain\r\n   Ellison, and the officers and men of H.M.S. Druid, for their\r\n   spirited conduct and bravery on the 8th instant, in having,\r\n   jointly with the Crescent, repelled ships of the enemy treble\r\n   our force. It is to be regretted that the bad sailing of the\r\n   Eurydice prevented their deriving the advantage they otherwise\r\n   would have received from Captain Cole and his brave ship's\r\n   company.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Crescent, Guernsey Roads, 9th June 1794.\r\n\r\n   General Memorandum.\r\n\r\n   Sir James Saumarez requests Captain Cole will signify to the\r\n   officers and ship's company of his Majesty's ship Eurydice,\r\n   under his command, how truly mortified he felt himself at being\r\n   deprived of their support and assistance on the 8th instant, in\r\n   consequence of the bad sailing of their ship. Had the enemy's\r\n   force on that day permitted their being brought to action on\r\n   more equal terms, he is too fully persuaded of the gallantry and\r\n   bravery of British seamen not to be convinced of its having been\r\n   attended with the most signal success.\r\n\r\nEarly in the action, the small vessels, being separated by the enemy,\r\nbore up for Plymouth. The Valiant arrived first with bad news; and\r\nthen Mr. Hall, of the Cockchafer, went to Admiral McBride, and\r\ninformed him that the whole of Sir James Saumarez' squadron was taken.\r\nThe admiral, who was then suffering under a fit of the gout, demanded\r\nif he saw them strike; to which Mr. Hall replied that he did not, but\r\nthey could not escape. This so enraged the admiral, who would not\r\nbelieve Sir James's squadron had been taken, that he threatened to\r\nthrow his crutch at him, and sent him out of his presence in a very\r\nsummary manner, charging him to return to Guernsey with the following\r\nletter:\r\n\r\n   Tuesday, 10th June.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n   If I can gather anything right from Hall, of the little lugger\r\n   that ran away from you, this will find you at Guernsey, and I\r\n   hope in good health, with your associates; to whom remember me.\r\n   The conduct of the small craft you are the best judge of, and I\r\n   shall suspend my conjectures till I see or hear from you on that\r\n   subject. As you must naturally have received damage, you will, I\r\n   think, do well to return hither, by which time I suppose La\r\n   Margaretta will arrive. Yesterday evening Sir Roger Curtis\r\n   landed from the Phaeton. He left Lord Howe on the 4th. I know\r\n   not the particulars, but there has been a general action; and I\r\n   think Monsieur Jean Bon L'Andre and his Guillotine have had a\r\n   thorough drubbing. We have lost very few officers of rank. Lord\r\n   Howe is perfectly well, of which I give you joy.\r\n\r\n   Yours, my dear sir, most affectionately,\r\n   JOHN McBRIDE.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the commodore, in consequence of the enemy's motions,\r\nwrote the following letter to the Admiralty:\r\n\r\n   Crescent, Guernsey Road, 11th June 1794.\r\n\r\n   SIR,\r\n\r\n   I have despatched the Active cutter to Spithead, to acquaint\r\n   you, for the information of their lordships, that the French\r\n   squadron which engaged his Majesty's ships under my command on\r\n   Sunday last, put into Cancalle Bay the day following. I have\r\n   reason to believe they are part of the squadron that chased this\r\n   ship, in company with the Nymphe and Concorde, on the 2nd\r\n   instant, off the Seven Islands; and that the ships of the line\r\n   that were then in company proceeded to Brest.\r\n\r\n   His Majesty's ship Severn joined me this morning from Plymouth;\r\n   and I propose to proceed to the Sound to-morrow, in compliance\r\n   with orders from Rear-admiral McBride.\r\n\r\n   JAMES SAUMAREZ.\r\n   Philip Stephens, Esq. Secretary, &c. &c. &c.\r\n\r\nThe squadron returned to Plymouth Sound on the 14th of June, when\r\nSir James sent the following letter to his brother:--\r\n\r\n   Saturday, 14th June 1794.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR RICHARD,\r\n\r\n   We sailed from the island at four yesterday morning, unluckily\r\n   too soon for the arrival of the packet; by which I lost all the\r\n   pretty things you, with other friends, said to me on the\r\n   business of last Sunday. We remain also uninformed of Lord\r\n   Howe's victory, except that we know a general action has taken\r\n   place favourable to us. This evening will, I hope, clear up all\r\n   our doubts.\r\n\r\n   The French squadron put into Cancalle Bay the day after our\r\n   rencontre, and I have reason to think were rather sore from our\r\n   well-directed fire. That their fire did not take more effect on\r\n   the Crescent, must be ascribed to a superior Providence; as, I\r\n   will own to you, I never saw shot fall thicker about any ship\r\n   than at the time we hauled up for Vason Bay.\r\n\r\n   My old pilot, Jean Breton, has infinite merit, and I must have\r\n   him recommended to that very laudable society for the\r\n   encouragement of the protection of the commerce of the country.\r\n   He has a large family, to whom any pecuniary recompense will be\r\n   of service; but as two other pilots exerted themselves, one on\r\n   board the Druid, and the other in this ship, I hope they will\r\n   also be considered. Mention this to my worthy friend the Lord\r\n   Mayor, who will probably have the goodness to undertake the\r\n   business.\r\n\r\n   I am proceeding to Plymouth for further orders, and you may rest\r\n   assured of hearing from me when any thing is fixed. The Valiant\r\n   lugger has this instant joined me from Plymouth, and has brought\r\n   me the extraordinary Gazette; I most truly rejoice at the good\r\n   news it contains, though I am savage enough to wish a few more\r\n   had been sunk or taken.\r\n\r\n   This business absorbs all lesser considerations, and I must be\r\n   satisfied if I can only be considered the _horse-radish_ to\r\n   garnish the roast beef.\r\n\r\n   Adieu, my worthy Richard: lose no time, as the Admiral writes to\r\n   me we shall sail again early next week. I hope to arrive in the\r\n   Sound this evening.\r\n\r\n   Yours affectionately,\r\n   JAS. SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\nSir James was, however, disappointed in receiving an answer from his\r\nbrother, being ordered to sail in command of a squadron. The following\r\nletter concludes the account of the late meritorious affair:\r\n\r\n\r\n   Plymouth, Crescent, June 1794.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR RICHARD,\r\n\r\n   I have been much disappointed, not to receive a single line from\r\n   you since we sailed from this place, although I am convinced you\r\n   must have written by way of Guernsey. To-morrow I sail with a\r\n   squadron of six frigates under my command, viz. Crescent,\r\n   Nymphe, Blonde, Druid, Concorde, and Severn: my only fear is,\r\n   that we shall not be so fortunate as to fall in with the enemy.\r\n   Admiral McBride has shown me his reply from the Admiralty to his\r\n   letter, inclosing my account of our late business off Guernsey.\r\n   It is highly flattering to myself, and expressive of their\r\n   approbation of my conduct in the strongest terms. I doubt my\r\n   letter being published, as it is only in instances where success\r\n   has been the consequence.\r\n\r\n   What a noble business that of Lord Howe! And how well he has\r\n   fulfilled the expectations which those who knew him had formed\r\n   of his character! Several of my friends are here who were in\r\n   that action, and speak in the highest strain of panegyric of the\r\n   whole of his conduct.\r\n\r\n   I wait for my wife being again on her legs to compose on the\r\n   late victory. Why have you not a turn for poetry and music, so\r\n   as to indite a song on this subject, in lieu of the famous\r\n   Ninety-second, that has had the run of a whole century?.\r\n\r\n   Adieu, my worthy friend! I am truly and faithfully yours,\r\n   JAS. SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n1794, 1795.\r\n\r\n   Sir James commands a Squadron of Frigates, in the\r\n   Channel.--Visit to Weymouth.--Joins the Channel Fleet.--Black\r\n   Rocks.--Private Letters and Instructions.--Appointed to the\r\n   Orion.--Crescent's Officers and Crew volunteer to follow\r\n   him.--Appointed to the Marlborough (_pro tempore_).--Commands a\r\n   detached Squadron.--Returns to the Orion, attached to the\r\n   Channel Fleet.--Private Letters.--Lord Bridport's\r\n   Action.--Orion, the headmost Ship, begins the battle.--Official\r\n   Letter.--Two private Accounts.--Returns to\r\n   Portsmouth--Expedition to Isle Dieu.--Returns to Spithead.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Saumarez, whose conduct in his late encounter with the enemy's\r\nsquadron had called forth the admiration of his country, and the high\r\napprobation of the Admiralty, was continued in command of the squadron\r\ndestined to protect the Channel islands. Admiral McBride emphatically\r\nsaid, \"their defence could not be in better hands.\" Sir James left\r\nPlymouth on the 16th of June 1794, and arrived at Guernsey on the\r\nfollowing day. The enemy's large ships escaped to Brest before any\r\nforce could be brought to intercept them. The station of Saumarez was\r\nfrom Cape Barfleur to the Seven Islands; and, on the English coast,\r\nbetween the Isle of Wight and the Start, having four frigates under\r\nhis command. The following letter to his brother gives an amusing\r\naccount of a false alarm, occasioned by the squadron while his Majesty\r\nGeorge the Third was at Weymouth:\r\n\r\n   Crescent, 18th September 1794.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR RICHARD,\r\n\r\n   I was made happy yesterday by the sight of your handwriting, of\r\n   which I had for a considerable time been deprived. You will have\r\n   learnt from the Lord Mayor of our short cruise off Cherbourg. On\r\n   our return, Sunday evening, we caused an alarm I had little\r\n   expected: the Trusty, having fallen in with the four frigates,\r\n   made the private signal, which, not being distinctly seen,\r\n   remained unanswered. In consequence of which she proceeded to\r\n   Weymouth Road, making signals of an enemy. The troops were\r\n   ordered under arms, the batteries manned, and the royal\r\n   carriages got in readiness. At our approach to the road after\r\n   dark, a shot was fired from the Trusty. This ship was secured\r\n   with springs on her cables, and was ready to pour her broadside,\r\n   when I fortunately made the night-signal, to denote we were\r\n   friends. I immediately went on shore, and found the royal family\r\n   at the rooms, not without apprehension of the enemy's landing.\r\n\r\n   The King desired to see me, and very heartily laughed at the\r\n   circumstance. I remained near an hour in conference with their\r\n   Majesties in the tea-room; a very distinguished honour, I assure\r\n   you, as even the lords in waiting are scarcely ever admitted\r\n   during meals: I was highly flattered at the very gracious and\r\n   flattering reception I met with. The next day they were on the\r\n   water, and the King expressed himself much satisfied with the\r\n   manoeuvres of the squadron under my directions. Lady S. and\r\n   Mrs. Le Marchant, of Bath, were on board the Crescent, and I was\r\n   happy in the company of Mr. G----. All dined on board, and\r\n   seemed well satisfied with the day.\r\n\r\n   I expect Admiral McBride the beginning of next week; at which\r\n   time we shall either go to Plymouth or Portsmouth, to complete\r\n   our provisions. The weather is so bad that we must not expect\r\n   the packet from Guernsey, and it prevents the one from Weymouth\r\n   putting to sea. Love to my sister and children.\r\n\r\n   Yours most affectionately,\r\n   Jas. Saumarez.\r\n\r\nThe Crescent continued on Channel service until the 10th of October,\r\nwhen she returned to Cawsand Bay; and, after a short cruise in the\r\nentrance of the Channel, she came to Plymouth to be refitted on the\r\n4th of November. On the 8th she was taken into dock, not having been\r\ncoppered since 1784. Sir James had now an opportunity of enjoying\r\nrepose for two months, (his ship being in course of repair,) till the\r\n15th of January 1795, when he was immediately attached to the grand\r\nfleet under Earl Howe.\r\n\r\nThe following instructions will show the nature of the arduous service\r\non which Saumarez was destined to be employed for a considerable time:\r\n\r\n   Instructions for the conduct of ships appointed to obtain\r\n   intelligence of the state of the enemy's naval force at Brest.\r\n\r\n   Two frigates, supported by one or more ships of the line, will\r\n   be most generally appointed for obtaining intelligence of the\r\n   enemy's naval force, from time to time, when the wind has been\r\n   favourable to their fleet, or detachment thereof, to put to sea.\r\n   The frigates so appointed are meant to stretch from Ushant\r\n   inward to the Black Rocks, together or in succession, as\r\n   requisite for their mutual support, and better means of\r\n   communicating with the covering ships; and off St. Matthew's\r\n   Point, or so as to discover whether the enemy's fleet are still\r\n   in Brest water, and, if easily practicable, the number and\r\n   situation of the enemy's ships of war there, and in the adjacent\r\n   anchoring bays without the Goulet. The covering ships of the\r\n   line, it is supposed, will generally answer the purpose of their\r\n   appointment by keeping off, or a little within, the Black Rocks,\r\n   whilst the frigates are advanced to the more eastern situation\r\n   before mentioned. The several captains so employed are,\r\n   nevertheless, to be governed on this service by the state of the\r\n   weather and movements of the enemy, as they see best in their\r\n   discretion, or may be directed by the commanding officer, for\r\n   being able to get to sea with facility when necessary for the\r\n   purpose of this appointment; and, having made the intended\r\n   discovery, they are to return for reporting observations to me\r\n   with all convenient despatch. They are to observe, that the\r\n   capture of single ships of the line or frigates, or any action\r\n   with the enemy not absolutely requisite for the security of\r\n   their ships, is not an object of equal moment to compensate for\r\n   any delay in conveying the earliest information to me, by signal\r\n   or personal intercourse, of the state or motions of the enemy as\r\n   aforesaid. The ordering of the fleet in their absence on this\r\n   service will be calculated for arriving off Ushant as early as\r\n   possible the next morning, on these occasions if the detached\r\n   ships should not have joined the fleet the preceding day, in\r\n   view to take advantage of every opportunity to intercept the\r\n   ships of the enemy attempting to put to sea from Brest. And as\r\n   it may be requisite often to renew this appointment, the\r\n   intention will be expressed by signal No. 181, together with the\r\n   particular signals (one or more) of the ships of the line and\r\n   frigates then meant to be so employed; and the signal No. 124\r\n   will be subsequently made when the ships are to part company\r\n   from the fleet for such purpose.\r\n\r\n   Given on board the Queen Charlotte,\r\n   Torbay, 5th February 1795.\r\n   HOWE.\r\n\r\n   To Sir James Saumarez,\r\n   Captain H.M.S. Crescent.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion Sir James Saumarez wrote the following letter to his\r\nbrother, which shows the high opinion entertained of his services off\r\nthe Black Rocks by his lordship:\r\n\r\n   Spithead, 15th January 1795.\r\n\r\n   I had the pleasure of yours yesterday morning, and have only\r\n   time to acquaint you that part of the fleet are now dropping\r\n   down to St. Helen's, and to-morrow we hope to put to sea. The\r\n   wind is far to the southward, but I hope we shall be able to get\r\n   down Channel before it comes to the westward. There can be\r\n   little doubt but the enemy's fleet are still at sea. If we have\r\n   the good fortune to meet them, the business will be glorious for\r\n   the country.\r\n\r\n   Our line consists of thirty-five, ten of which are\r\n   three-deckers. The French have only thirty-two, and four only of\r\n   three-deckers. My situation in the fleet (repeating frigate) is\r\n   certainly more desirable than a less conspicuous one; at the\r\n   same time, I would rather command a seventy-four. Lord Howe is\r\n   remarkably gracious, and has overwhelmed me with compliments in\r\n   his opinion of my merits. I have the more to accomplish in order\r\n   to show myself deserving of it. Be assured of my zealous\r\n   endeavours. Adieu! Give my sincere love to my sister and dear\r\n   children.\r\n\r\n   I am ever affectionately yours,\r\n   JAS. SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\nSir James always preferred the command of a ship of the line to a\r\nfrigate, notwithstanding the chances of prize-money are in favour of\r\nthe latter. He accordingly made the following application to the First\r\nLord of the Admiralty; and it will be seen, by the subsequent\r\ncorrespondence, that his wishes were complied with.\r\n\r\n   MY LORD,\r\n\r\n   I beg leave to acquaint your lordship, that some time since I\r\n   made application to be appointed to a line-of-battle ship, and\r\n   the Earl of Chatham was pleased to signify his intention of\r\n   meeting my wishes the earliest opportunity. I shall esteem\r\n   myself greatly obliged to your lordship to appoint me to one,\r\n   and at the same time to permit me to take my officers and ship's\r\n   company.\r\n\r\n   I have the honour to be, &c. &c.\r\n   JAMES SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n   Right Honourable Earl Spencer.\r\n\r\n\r\n   SIR,\r\n\r\n   I take the earliest opportunity of acknowledging your letter to\r\n   be appointed to a line-of-battle ship. I am not at present\r\n   apprised of there being an immediate opportunity to comply with\r\n   your request; but it will give me great pleasure to have an\r\n   early one afforded me of promoting an officer of so much\r\n   acknowledged merit.\r\n\r\n   I am, sir, with great respect,\r\n   Your obedient humble servant,\r\n   SPENCER.\r\n\r\n   To Captain Saumarez, H.M.S. Crescent.\r\n   Admiralty, December 24th, 1794.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Crescent, Spithead, 1st March 1795.\r\n\r\n   MY LORD,\r\n\r\n   I beg to avail myself of the return of the fleet into port, to\r\n   remind your lordship of the application I had the honour to make\r\n   to be appointed to a line-of-battle ship; and as the Orion is\r\n   likely soon to become vacant, I shall be greatly obliged to your\r\n   lordship to have the goodness to give me the command of her, and\r\n   at the same time to permit me to take my officers and ship's\r\n   company.\r\n\r\n   I have the honour to be, my lord,\r\n   Your lordship's most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\n   JAMES SAUMAREZ.\r\n   Right Honourable Earl Spencer.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Crescent, off Spithead, 4th March 1795.\r\n\r\n   MY LORD,\r\n\r\n   I beg to express my sincere acknowledgments to your lordship for\r\n   having been pleased to appoint me to the command of the Orion. I\r\n   shall be further obliged to your lordship to permit the\r\n   commissioned and warrant officers of the Crescent to be removed\r\n   to her, with the ship's company.\r\n\r\n   I have the honour to be, &c. &c.\r\n   JAMES SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n   Earl Spencer, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nSir James remained with the Channel fleet until the 13th of March,\r\nwhen, at his own request, he was removed into his Majesty's ship\r\nOrion. The whole crew of the Crescent volunteered to follow him, and\r\nhis application for them was in part complied with; as also for\r\nLieutenants Otter and Rye, and some of the warrant and petty officers,\r\nwho were consequently turned over to that ship, which was fitting at\r\nPortsmouth. As it would be a considerable time before she could be\r\nrefitted so as to be ready for sea, Captain Saumarez was, at the\r\nspecial application of the admiral, Lord Hugh Seymour, appointed (pro\r\ntempore) to the Marlborough of seventy-four guns, and attached to a\r\ndetachment of the grand fleet under the Honourable W. Waldegrave,\r\n(afterwards Lord Radstock,) cruising between Ushant and Cape\r\nFinisterre. His appointment was dated 19th March 1795. On the 8th of\r\nApril he became senior officer of the detached squadron off the\r\nWestern Isles, under the orders of Lord Bridport. He returned on the\r\n8th of June to take command of his own ship, the Orion, which had been\r\nfitted out by Captain Donnelly, and was now ready to receive orders\r\nfor sea. He was now again placed under the orders of his lordship, the\r\ncommander-in-chief of the Channel fleet, and sailed on the 12th of\r\nJune, two days after his arrival. On the 22nd, the squadron fell in\r\nwith the enemy off L'Orient at daylight, at which time the Orion was\r\none of the sternmost ships when the signal was made to chase. Her\r\ncaptain soon gave a manifest proof of his zeal and abilities on this\r\noccasion. She was, before morning of the 23rd, the headmost ship of\r\nthe fleet; and, before six o'clock, was the first which actually began\r\nthe action with one of the enemy's largest ships.\r\n\r\nThe following is a copy of Lord Bridport's official despatch:\r\n\r\n   Royal George, at sea, 24th June 1795.\r\n\r\n   SIR,\r\n\r\n   It is with sincere satisfaction I acquaint you, for the\r\n   information of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, that\r\n   his Majesty's squadron under my command attacked the enemy's\r\n   fleet, consisting of twelve ships of the line, attended with\r\n   eleven frigates and some smaller cruisers, on the 23rd instant,\r\n   close in with the port of L'Orient. The ships which struck are\r\n   the Alexander, Le Formidable, and Le Tigre, which were with\r\n   difficulty retained. If the enemy had not been protected and\r\n   sheltered by the land, I have every reason to believe that a\r\n   much greater number, if not all the line-of-battle ships, would\r\n   have been taken or destroyed.\r\n\r\n   In detailing the particulars of this service, I am to state that\r\n   at the dawn of day, on the 22nd instant, the Nymphe and Astrea,\r\n   being the look-out frigates ahead, made the signal for the\r\n   enemy's fleet. I soon perceived there was no intention to meet\r\n   me in battle; consequently, I made the signal for four of the\r\n   best-sailing ships, the Sanspareil, Orion, Russell, and\r\n   Colossus, and, soon afterwards, the whole fleet, to chase; which\r\n   continued all day and the whole night with very little wind.\r\n\r\n   Early in the morning of the 23rd, the headmost ships, the Orion,\r\n   Irresistible, Queen Charlotte, Russell, Colossus, and\r\n   Sanspareil, were pretty well up with the enemy; and a little\r\n   before six o'clock the action began, and continued till near\r\n   nine. When the ships struck, the British squadron was near to\r\n   some batteries, and in the face of a strong naval port, which\r\n   will manifest to the public the zeal, intrepidity, and skill of\r\n   the admirals, captains, and all the other officers and seamen,\r\n   and soldiers, employed upon this service; and they are fully\r\n   entitled to my warmest acknowledgments.\r\n\r\n   I beg also to be allowed to mark my approbation in a particular\r\n   manner of Captain Domett's conduct, serving under my flag, for\r\n   his manly spirit, and for the assistance I received from his\r\n   active and attentive mind. I feel great satisfaction in doing\r\n   justice to the meritorious conduct of all the officers of every\r\n   class, as well as to the bravery of the seamen and soldiers in\r\n   the Royal George, upon this event and on former occasions.\r\n\r\n   I judged it necessary, upon the information I received of the\r\n   force of the enemy, to put the Robust, Thunderer, and Standard\r\n   into my line of battle; but their distance from my squadron, and\r\n   there being little wind, prevented them from joining me till\r\n   after the action was over.\r\n\r\n   I shall proceed upon my station as soon as I have ordered a\r\n   distribution of the prisoners, and made other necessary\r\n   arrangements for the squadron. It is my intention to keep at\r\n   sea, in order to fulfil every part of my instructions.\r\n\r\n   I have judged it necessary to send Captain Domett with my\r\n   despatches, who will give their lordships such further\r\n   particulars as shall have occurred to him on the victory we have\r\n   gained.\r\n\r\n   I am, &c.\r\n   BRIDPORT.\r\n\r\n   To Evan Nepean, Esq.\r\n\r\nThe enemy made their escape into L'Orient. By some accounts the\r\ncommander-in-chief has been blamed for not continuing the action; but\r\nthis does not seem to have been the opinion of Sir James Saumarez, who\r\nwrote the following letter to his brother on the day after the action.\r\nIt is said that the fleet were not supplied with pilots for that part\r\nof the coast.\r\n\r\n   Orion, at sea, 24th June 1795.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR RICHARD,\r\n\r\n   I have the satisfaction to acquaint you that, last Monday, we\r\n   fell in with the French fleet, about eighteen leagues from the\r\n   Isle de Groix. The signal for a general chase was made at six\r\n   o'clock; but, having little wind, we were still at a\r\n   considerable distance from them in the evening. Our headmost\r\n   ships denoted by signal that they consisted of fourteen sail of\r\n   the line and eleven frigates. The admiral made the signal to\r\n   engage the enemy on coming up with them. It was with great\r\n   delight I found the Orion sail extremely well, and in the\r\n   morning we were one of the headmost ships of the squadron. I\r\n   should observe, that Sir John Warren's convoy were in sight at\r\n   the time we first saw the enemy; and a vessel was detached to\r\n   order the Robust and Thunderer to join us, which made our number\r\n   nineteen sail of the line.\r\n\r\n   The French fleet at daylight was about five miles from us,\r\n   crowding all sail, and steering for their coast, which appeared\r\n   in sight. At five o'clock, this ship, being ahead of the Queen\r\n   Charlotte, began the action, and kept up a constant fire as we\r\n   came up; which was warmly returned by the enemy's sternmost\r\n   ships, one of which was the Montagne. Finding I could go to\r\n   windward of one of their ships, I hauled up between her and\r\n   their fleet, and gave her our larboard guns directly for her\r\n   stern. She was afterwards attacked by other ships, to which she\r\n   struck, and proved to be the Alexander.\r\n\r\n   The Irresistible, Russell, Colossus, and Sanspareil were the\r\n   headmost of our fleet after the Orion and Queen Charlotte, and\r\n   engaged the enemy as they came up. A French seventy-four, that\r\n   had taken fire on the poop, struck to the frigates. She is\r\n   called the Formidable, and is not materially damaged from the\r\n   fire. When the Queen, London, and finally the Royal George, came\r\n   into action, they kept up a most amazing fire; but by this time\r\n   the enemy were within three miles of their coast, and they all\r\n   escaped except the Tigre, which struck to the Royal George.\r\n\r\n   For further details I must refer you to the public accounts. Our\r\n   loss in this ship has been inconsiderable when I assure you we\r\n   were engaged with very little intermission the whole time of the\r\n   action, which lasted four hours. We have four killed, two since\r\n   dead, and eighteen wounded. The ship has suffered more in\r\n   proportion in the hull, masts, and sails. We regret not to have\r\n   had a few leagues' more space, as none could then have escaped.\r\n   Port Louis, near L'Orient, has afforded them this timely\r\n   shelter, but not till they had a severe drubbing.\r\n\r\n   You will show the contents of this letter to Mr. Le Mesurier, as\r\n   I have scarcely one moment to spare.\r\n\r\n   Adieu! Remember me most kindly to my sister; and believe me\r\n   truly, my dear Richard,\r\n\r\n   Yours affectionately,\r\n   JAS. SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n   You will oblige Lady S. by inclosing this, after perusal, to\r\n   her.\r\n\r\nThis detachment of the Channel fleet, which was destined to protect\r\nthe ill-fated expedition to Quiberon Bay, under Sir J.B. Warren,\r\ncontinued for some time on the coast; but the Orion, being one of the\r\nships which had suffered most, was ordered to Portsmouth. On his\r\narrival, Sir James wrote the following letter to his brother Richard.\r\n\r\n   Orion, off St. Helens, 12th July 1795.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n   I take the earliest opportunity to acquaint you, that I parted\r\n   from the fleet last Thursday, with the Charon, hospital ship,\r\n   which I saw safe into Portland this morning: Captain Grindall,\r\n   (the only captain wounded,) who took his passage on board her,\r\n   was much recovered. On the day I left the fleet, Admiral\r\n   Cornwallis, with the ships under his command, joined Lord\r\n   Bridport; and I imagine the Queen Charlotte, with the ships that\r\n   suffered most in the action, will go home. As the Orion requires\r\n   a new fore-mast and bowsprit, besides considerable repair, I\r\n   take it for granted she will be ordered into harbour.\r\n\r\n   A few days after the action we were alarmed by the appearance of\r\n   an epidemic fever on board; but, by sending the men infected on\r\n   board the hospital ship, and using timely precaution, I am happy\r\n   to say it has entirely subsided, but it gave me a great degree\r\n   of concern: added to this, we have had the small-pox on board;\r\n   but it has been of so favourable a kind, that the men who have\r\n   had it are all doing well, two excepted, who died on board the\r\n   hospital ship. Several are now under inoculation, and I hope\r\n   will recover.\r\n\r\n   We have lost eight men in consequence of the action: all the\r\n   wounded, except two, are nearly well; their wounds, I am happy\r\n   to find, were slight.\r\n\r\n   It will have surprised you to find me differ in my statement of\r\n   the action from the Admiral, when I mention having begun the\r\n   action. The fact was, the Irresistible fired two, or, I believe,\r\n   three bow-guns, but I never could consider that entitling her to\r\n   being the first in action; _but of this hereafter_.\r\n\r\n   Now is a good opportunity for you and my sister to come and\r\n   spend a few days at Portsmouth, if you can spare time to\r\n   undertake the journey. Come down immediately, and take a sail in\r\n   the ship into Portsmouth Harbour. I was in great hope to be in\r\n   time to see Lady S. this evening, but I fear it is impossible;\r\n   it is near eight o'clock, and we are no nearer than St. Helen's\r\n   Road, with little wind. I have heard from none of my friends\r\n   during the cruise, so that I know not what became of you after\r\n   your peregrination to St. Helens.\r\n\r\n   The prizes left the fleet ten days ago, and must be expected the\r\n   first westerly winds. You will be glad to hear that Mr. Otter is\r\n   promoted.\r\n\r\n   Yours affectionately,\r\n   JAS. SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n   P.S. Portsmouth, 15th July 1795. I have only time to acquaint\r\n   you with my being just landed. Let me hear from you. Adieu!\r\n\r\nWe here give a diagram of this action at the time it began. When the\r\nIrresistible fired her bow-guns, she was in _chase_, astern and not up\r\nalongside of the enemy; but the Orion reserved all her fire until\r\nactually alongside; she was certainly the first that could bring all\r\nher broadside to bear on one of the enemy's ships, and therefore\r\njustly claims the honour of having commenced the battle. But Sir James\r\ntook no steps to correct the statement, and was, as usual, content\r\nwith being included in the mass of those who distinguished themselves\r\non that occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Position of the hostile fleets on the morning of the 23rd June\r\n   1795, when the headmost ships brought the rear of the enemy to\r\n   action.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n   No. 1.

It was the 18th July before she was\r\nreported ready for sea. On the 21st he wrote the following letter to\r\nhis brother, describing the service on which he was now to be\r\nemployed:\r\n\r\n   Ryde, 21st August 1795.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR RICHARD,\r\n\r\n   Expecting to sail from day to day, I delayed writing till I\r\n   could acquaint you with the precise time of our departure. This\r\n   morning the wind proved easterly, but it has again veered to the\r\n   westward, and become as uncertain as ever, so that I yet hope to\r\n   hear from you. I understand that about four thousand troops,\r\n   _British_, and fifteen hundred emigrants, sail under our escort.\r\n   They are commanded by General Doyle, and it is supposed are\r\n   destined to take possession of Noirmoutier, to keep up\r\n   communication with Charrette's army. Monsieur, who you know is\r\n   embarked on board the Jason, accompanies them. It is to be hoped\r\n   that this last effort of ours to secure a footing on their own\r\n   territory to these unfortunate people, will prove successful; I\r\n   say this last, for, from what I learn, Lord Moira resigns with\r\n   the whole of his staff, and the rest of his army are to be,\r\n   under command of Sir R. Abercromby, destined for the West\r\n   Indies.\r\n\r\n   We are likely to have enough on our hands should war be\r\n   continued, as it is impossible but we must have the Spanish to\r\n   contend with. Several ships sailed this morning to reinforce our\r\n   squadron in the North Seas, which shows the Dutch are beginning\r\n   to stir themselves.\r\n\r\n   I write from Ryde, where Lady S. has been since yesterday, being\r\n   near Spithead, where I must be every day. As the wind is at\r\n   present, there is every reason to expect that we shall be here\r\n   some days longer; therefore write to me. Adieu! God bless you\r\n   all!\r\n\r\n   I am truly and affectionately yours,\r\n   JAS. SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\nThe expedition, alluded to in the above letter, was placed under\r\ncommand of Rear-admiral Henry Harvey, and consisted of the Prince of\r\nWales (flag-ship), Queen Charlotte, Prince, Orion, Russell, Arethusa,\r\nand Jason, with a convoy of one hundred and twenty-six vessels. These\r\nwere detained at Spithead till the end of September; and on the 13th\r\nof October they reached Isle Dieu, where they were destined to\r\nco-operate with the former expedition. When off Hedic, Admiral Harvey\r\nsent the Orion to join Commodore Sir John Borlase Warren, with that\r\npart of the convoy intended to act with the royalists, while he\r\nproceeded with the rest to the West Indies.\r\n\r\nThe troops were landed. The Orion was employed blockading the coast\r\nnear Rochfort and L'Orient; the nature of which memorable service will\r\nbe best understood from the following letters from Sir James to his\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\n   Orion, at sea, 26th October.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR RICHARD,\r\n\r\n   I have just learnt from the Admiral, that he intends to despatch\r\n   the Porcupine for England, which gives me an opportunity of\r\n   writing a line merely to acquaint you of our being in\r\n   existence, but most deucedly tired of our cruise: nothing worthy\r\n   our notice has occurred since my last letter. Sir John Warren\r\n   left Quiberon Bay last Wednesday for Noirmoutier, whence it is\r\n   supposed the emigrants will join Charrette's army. We pay\r\n   frequent visits to our friends in Port Louis. They continue\r\n   nearly in the same state as when we left them after the 23rd of\r\n   June; and, from the intelligence we have obtained, they are not\r\n   in any forwardness for sea, being without stores or men.\r\n\r\n   We experienced hitherto remarkable fine weather, which I hope\r\n   will continue; but nothing can equal our unvaried scene, fixed\r\n   to this confounded spot, without the least prospect of anything\r\n   falling in our way. We have not even the advantage of hearing\r\n   from England; for, sparingly, two ships only have joined us from\r\n   Plymouth since we are on this station. In short, my dear friend,\r\n   I am heartily tired of so inactive a situation, and shall very\r\n   sincerely rejoice to be relieved from it. You are much more\r\n   likely to receive accounts of the expedition than we are, having\r\n   but little intercourse with the army, and that little is solely\r\n   confined to the Admiral, who deals out the news very\r\n   _cautiously_. Could we but hear from our friends, it would yield\r\n   us some comfort; but that we are also denied: it is, however,\r\n   some satisfaction we can let them know we are alive. God bless\r\n   you! and believe me, with my kindest love to my dear sister and\r\n   children,\r\n\r\n   Yours most affectionately,\r\n   JAS. SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Orion, Houat, 26th November 1795.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR RICHARD,\r\n\r\n   We sailed from Isle Dieu this day, subsequent to my letter by\r\n   the Thunderer; and various have been the decisions respecting\r\n   withdrawing the troops from that island. On Monday, Sir John\r\n   Warren sailed with the Robust, Theseus, and four frigates, with\r\n   the intention of making the embarkation; but it came on to blow\r\n   so strong that they were obliged to put back. I was dispensed\r\n   with from that service, by having been appointed to carry on the\r\n   communication with the royalists, for the purpose of conveying\r\n   to them the immense supply of stores and ammunition intended for\r\n   them, besides about thirty thousand pounds in specie. The 24th\r\n   was the day fixed for their being landed, and General George was\r\n   to muster all his force to receive them, at a place called\r\n   Bitiers, at the entrance of the Villaine; but the weather proved\r\n   so boisterous on that and the following day, that there existed\r\n   no possibility of any communication.\r\n\r\n   Sir John Warren, to my great satisfaction, joined me this\r\n   morning with the frigates; the embarkation from Isle Dieu having\r\n   at last been given up. To-morrow we hope to hear that our\r\n   friends occupy the post agreed on; and we shall throw them as\r\n   speedily as possible, by means of the chasse-marees and boats of\r\n   the squadron, the various articles in our possession which they\r\n   so much want.\r\n\r\n   The last letters I have received were dated the 19th: they\r\n   mention P---- being under arrest; but there was a difference of\r\n   opinion respecting him, which was submitted to Monsieur. As his\r\n   Royal Highness is gone home, it will be some time before his\r\n   fate is decided. Being informed that the Standard was ordered\r\n   for England, I would not lose the opportunity, and in some way I\r\n   hope to inform you with the successful result of our enterprise:\r\n   once ended, I hope we shall bend our steps homeward.\r\n\r\n   Our friend Dan, with Phil. Dumaresq, are perfectly well.\r\n   Remember me with kindest love to my sister, and believe me ever\r\n   affectionately yours,\r\n\r\n   JAS. SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\nThe details of the failure of this expedition need not be dwelt upon;\r\nit was finally determined on the 13th of December to withdraw the\r\ntroops, and Sir James Saumarez consequently received the following\r\norder:\r\n\r\n   By Henry Harvey, Esq. Rear-admiral of the Red, &c.\r\n   To Sir James Saumarez, Captain of H.M.S. Orion.\r\n\r\n   You are hereby required and directed to take under your convoy\r\n   all the transports, store-ships, victuallers, and other vessels\r\n   lying in this bay, and put to sea in company with his Majesty's\r\n   squadron under my command. You will have under your direction\r\n   his Majesty's ship Porcupine, whose captain is directed to\r\n   follow your orders. You are to use your utmost endeavours to\r\n   keep company with me; but, in case of separation, make the best\r\n   of your way to Spithead, leaving off Plymouth such of the\r\n   victuallers as may have sailed from that port.\r\n\r\n   Given under my hand, on board the\r\n   Prince of Wales, 17th December 1795,\r\n   Houat Roads.\r\n   H. HARVEY.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Harvey parted from the convoy off Brest, and Sir James arrived\r\nat Spithead, after having looked into Brest, on the 30th December, and\r\nreported his arrival to the Secretary of the Admiralty; to which he\r\nreceived the following answer:\r\n\r\n   Admiralty Office, 31st December 1795.\r\n\r\n   SIR,\r\n\r\n   I have received, and communicated to my Lords Commissioners of\r\n   the Admiralty, your letter of yesterday's date, informing them\r\n   of your arrival at Spithead in the ship you command, with part\r\n   of the transports under your convoy, from Quiberon Bay; and I\r\n   have their lordships' command to acquaint you that they are\r\n   pleased with your proceedings.\r\n\r\n   I am, sir, your obedient humble servant,\r\n   EVAN NEPEAN.\r\n\r\n   To Captain Sir James Saumarez,\r\n   H.M.S. Orion, Spithead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n1796, 1797.\r\n\r\n   Orion taken into dock.--Is refitted, and joins the Channel\r\n   fleet.--Detached on a particular service.--Returns.--Proceeds to\r\n   reinforce Sir John Jervis.--List of his fleet.--Battle with\r\n   Spanish fleet off Cape St. Vincent described in a private\r\n   letter.--Conduct of Saumarez in the action.--Salvador del Mundo\r\n   strikes to the Orion, and is taken possession of by her\r\n   lieutenant.--Engages the Santissima Trinidada.--She strikes to\r\n   the Orion.--Remarks on that occasion.--Lagos Bay.--Lisbon.--Sir\r\n   James sails on a cruise with Admiral Sir H.\r\n   Nelson.--Returns.--Commands the advanced squadron.--Several\r\n   private letters.--Commands the advanced squadron off\r\n   Cadiz.--Mutiny in the fleet.--Anecdote and remarks thereon.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Orion was ordered into harbour; and on examination it was found\r\nshe had been so much strained during the last cruise, particularly in\r\nthe November storm, subsequently known by the name of \"Admiral\r\nChristian's gale,\" besides having sprung her lower masts, that it\r\nbecame absolutely necessary for her to be taken into dock. During the\r\nnext four months Sir James obtained, leave of absence; and it was not\r\nuntil the 7th of May 1796, that, having rejoined his ship, he was\r\ncalled into active service, the Orion being placed in Rear-admiral\r\nLord Hugh Seymour's division of the grand fleet which was fitted for\r\nforeign service.\r\n\r\nAfter a short cruise off Brest, the Orion proceeded to reinforce the\r\nfleet under Sir John Jervis, off Cape St. Vincent. This squadron\r\nconsisted of the Sanspareil (flag-ship), Orion, Triumph, Juste,\r\nHector, and Theseus, of the line; Phaeton and Latona, frigates; and\r\nIncendiary, fire-ship. On arriving off their station, Captain Saumarez\r\nwas detached to Fayall by Lord Hugh's order, dated the 13th June, to\r\nobtain stock, wine, &c. for the use of the squadron; and was directed\r\nto meet his lordship at ten leagues to the westward of that island;\r\nafter which the squadron returned to Cape St. Vincent, and from\r\nthence, in the month of September, they joined the Channel fleet,\r\nunder Lord Gardner.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of December the Orion returned to Spithead, in order to\r\nrefit and replenish in water and provisions, after a six months'\r\nunsuccessful cruise. This occupied but a short time; and on the 17th\r\nof the same month Sir James proceeded in the Orion, with a squadron\r\nunder the orders of Admiral W. Parker, to reinforce Sir John Jervis,\r\noff Cape St. Vincent. This squadron consisted of the Prince George,\r\n98; Namur, 90; Irresistible, Orion, and Colossus, of 74 guns; and\r\nThalia frigate. The junction with Sir John was effected on the 6th of\r\nFebruary. Thus reinforced, the Admiral had under his command--\r\n\r\n     Guns.\r\n     100      Victory,          Admiral Sir John Jervis.\r\n                                Captain Robert Calder.\r\n                                Captain George Grey.\r\n\r\n              Britannia,        Vice-admiral Charles Thompson.\r\n                                Captain Foley.\r\n\r\n     98       Barfleur,         Vice-admiral Hon.

Fox,              Lieutenant John Gibson.\r\n\r\nSir John Jervis was well aware that the Spanish fleet might be nearly\r\ndouble his force, but he kept working up towards the position where he\r\nexpected to meet them. On the 13th, in the morning, the Minerve,\r\nCaptain Cockburn, bearing the broad pendant of Commodore Nelson,\r\n(which was afterwards shifted to the Captain, 74) having on board Sir\r\nGilbert Elliot, late viceroy of Corsica and others, came into the\r\nfleet with intelligence that on the 11th, soon after quitting\r\nGibraltar, she had been chased by two Spanish line-of-battle ships;\r\nand that afterwards, when in the mouth of the Straits, she got sight\r\nof the Spanish fleet. Before sunset the signals were made for the\r\nBritish fleet to prepare for battle, and to keep in close order all\r\nthe night, during which the signal-guns of the Spaniards were\r\ndistinctly heard. At half-past two, A.M. the Portuguese frigate\r\nCarlotta spoke the Victory; and her captain (Campbell) gave\r\ninformation that the Spanish grand fleet, commanded by Don Josef de\r\nCordova, was only five leagues to windward; that they had sailed from\r\nCarthagena on the 1st of the month, and consisted of twenty-eight sail\r\nof the line, viz.\r\n\r\n     Guns.\r\n     130  Santissima Trinidada.\r\n            (four-decker).\r\n\r\n     112  Concepcion.\r\n          Conde de Regla.\r\n          Mexicano.\r\n          Principe de Asturias.\r\n          Salvador del Mundo.\r\n          San Josef.\r\n\r\n     80   Neptuno.\r\n          San Nicolas.\r\n\r\n     74   Atalante.\r\n          Bahama.\r\n          Conquistador.\r\n          Firme.\r\n          Glorioso.\r\n          Oriente.\r\n          Pelayo.\r\n          San Antonio.\r\n          San Domingo.\r\n          San Firmin.\r\n          San F'sco de Paula.\r\n          San Genaro.\r\n          San Ildefonso.\r\n          San Juan Nepomuceno.\r\n          San Pablo.\r\n          San Ysidro.\r\n          Soberano.\r\n          Terrible.\r\n\r\nThere were also twelve frigates, some gun-boats, and seventy\r\ntransports with troops, which were disembarked at Algesiras.\r\n\r\nIt is not positively known what the destination of this powerful fleet\r\nwas; some accounts say Cadiz, others Brest. It is, however, certain\r\nthat their admiral did not expect to meet more than ten or twelve sail\r\nof the line with Sir John Jervis, and that he anticipated an easy\r\ncapture, and a triumphant entry into port with his prizes. His dismay\r\nmay therefore be easily imagined at seeing the English fleet of\r\nfifteen sail of the line close to him, in excellent order of battle,\r\nwhile his own fleet was in such a scattered situation as to render it\r\nimpossible to prevent his intrepid enemy from cutting off a group\r\nwhich had separated from the main body of his fleet, and which in vain\r\nattempted to rejoin by crowding all sail.\r\n\r\nAs it is not our intention to enter into the particulars of this\r\nmemorable battle, excepting as regards the Orion, an extract from the\r\nadmiral's despatch will be sufficient to show the bold and decisive\r\nstep which he took on that occasion, and by which he succeeded in\r\nobtaining a most glorious victory over double his force.\r\n\r\n   Victory, Lagos Bay, 16th February 1797.\r\n\r\n   SIR,\r\n\r\n   The hope of falling in with the Spanish fleet, expressed in my\r\n   letter to you of the 13th instant, was confirmed last night by\r\n   distinctly hearing the report of their signal-guns, and by\r\n   intelligence received from Captain Foote, of his Majesty's ship\r\n   Niger, who had, with equal judgment and perseverance, kept\r\n   company with them for several days, on my prescribed\r\n   rendezvous, (which, from the strong S.E. wind, I had never been\r\n   able to reach,) and that they were not more than the distance of\r\n   three or four leagues from us.\r\n\r\n   I anxiously waited the dawn of day; when, being on the starboard\r\n   tack, Cape St. Vincent bearing E.N.E. eight leagues, I had the\r\n   satisfaction of seeing a number of ships extended from S.W. to\r\n   S., the wind then W. by S. At forty-nine minutes past ten, the\r\n   weather being extremely hazy, La Bonne Citoyenne made the signal\r\n   that the ships seen were of the line, twenty-five in number.\r\n\r\n   His Majesty's squadron under my command, consisting of fifteen\r\n   ships of the line, happily formed in the most compact order of\r\n   sailing in two lines. By carrying a press of sail, I was\r\n   fortunate in getting in with the enemy's fleet at half-past\r\n   eleven, before it had time to collect and form a regular order\r\n   of battle. Such a moment was not to be lost; and, confident in\r\n   the skill, valour, and discipline of the officers and men I had\r\n   the happiness to command, and judging that the honour of his\r\n   Majesty's arms, and the circumstances of the war in these seas,\r\n   required a considerable degree of enterprise, I felt myself\r\n   justified in departing from the regular system; and, passing\r\n   through their fleet in a line formed with the utmost celerity,\r\n   tacked, and thereby separated one-third from the main body.\r\n   After a partial cannonade, which prevented their rejunction till\r\n   the evening, and by the very great exertions of the ships which\r\n   had the good fortune to arrive up with the enemy on the larboard\r\n   tack, the ships named in the margin[11] were captured, and the\r\n   action ceased about five o'clock.\r\n\r\n   [11] The San Josef, Salvador del Mundo, San Nicolas, and San\r\n   Ysidro.\r\n\r\nThat the Orion was one of those ships which distinguished themselves\r\nwill best appear from the private letter of her brave commander to his\r\nbrother, written only the day after the action; a circumstance which\r\ncannot but give such a communication a value far superior to a more\r\nelaborate composition. The log also of his ship, written at the time\r\nby the master, to which we have had access, completely accords with\r\nthe facts so clearly stated in the letter.\r\n\r\n   Orion, Lagos Bay, 15th February 1797.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR RICHARD,\r\n\r\n   You will be happy to receive an account from me of the important\r\n   victory obtained by our squadron over the Spanish fleet,\r\n   consisting of nearly double our force. The Admiral having\r\n   received previous information of their sailing from Carthagena,\r\n   and of their cruising off the entrance of the Straits, gave us\r\n   timely notice of the intelligence by the signal to prepare for\r\n   battle.\r\n\r\n   Early on Tuesday morning, the weather being hazy, with light\r\n   winds, the frigates on the look-out made the signal for\r\n   discovering the enemy, and soon after we discerned several ships\r\n   to leeward, and the body of the fleet to windward. We were then\r\n   on the starboard tack, standing to the southward. The signal was\r\n   made to different ships to chase; and, shortly after, for the\r\n   fleet to form in line of battle as most convenient. The enemy at\r\n   this time were bearing down to join their ships to leeward; but\r\n   we came upon them so fast, that, before they could effect the\r\n   junction, the headmost ships, which were the Culloden, Prince\r\n   George, Orion, Blenheim, and Colossus, with the Victory and the\r\n   rest coming up, it was effectually prevented. They then hauled\r\n   their wind on the larboard tack, and our Admiral made the signal\r\n   for the fleet to tack. Our sternmost ships then became the\r\n   headmost.\r\n\r\n   Commodore Nelson, who had joined from Elba the day before,\r\n   shifted his pendant to the Captain, the leading ship, and\r\n   distinguished himself most eminently. The Culloden, Blenheim,\r\n   Prince George, and Orion, were the next that came up, and were\r\n   warmly engaged for nearly three hours with the body of the\r\n   enemy's fleet, who had not had the time, or address, to form\r\n   into any order. But it is only doing them justice to say, they\r\n   defended themselves very bravely.\r\n\r\n   We were, for above an hour, opposed to a three-decker, the\r\n   Salvador del Mundo, which finally struck to this ship; we\r\n   lowered the boat from the stern, and gave orders to Mr. Luce,\r\n   the first lieutenant, to take possession of her; still making\r\n   sail for the other ships, and following Admiral Parker in the\r\n   Prince George. The Excellent, which had passed us to windward,\r\n   had made a line-of-battle ship, the San Domingo, strike some\r\n   time before this.\r\n\r\n   Several ships of the enemy were extremely shattered in their\r\n   masts and sails; but, keeping up a warm fire on their ships, the\r\n   Captain laid one of them, the San Nicolas, an eighty-four, on\r\n   board, and hauled down her colours. A three-decker, the San\r\n   Josef, wishing, I believe, to rescue the ship, got on board of\r\n   her, and gave Commodore Nelson an opportunity of also hauling\r\n   down her colours. His bravery on this occasion is above all\r\n   praise.\r\n\r\n   The Namur and other ships had by this time joined the van, and\r\n   engaged as they came up. I stood for a three-decker, which,\r\n   after engaging some time, struck her colours: she first had\r\n   showed a white flag, which, though I concluded to indicate a\r\n   truce, was not satisfactory to myself, and we continued firing\r\n   till they hoisted an English flag over the Spanish, on which we\r\n   ceased firing.\r\n\r\n   The enemy's ships, many of which had not been in action, at this\r\n   time came up and were forming to windward. The Admiral made the\r\n   signal to wear and come to the wind on the starboard tack;\r\n   wishing, I believe, to keep his squadron collected near the\r\n   prizes, as well as the Captain, that was much disabled, besides\r\n   the Colossus, which ship very unfortunately lost her fore-yard\r\n   very early in the action. This ill-timed, but doubtless\r\n   necessary manoeuvre, lost us the additional triumph of having\r\n   the Purissima Concepcion, to grace the ships already in our\r\n   possession, and I experienced the regret of again seeing her\r\n   resume the Spanish colours.\r\n\r\n   I have here related to you facts as they really occurred, and I\r\n   believe all my officers will vouch for the authenticity of this\r\n   account. I am happy to acquaint you that we have providentially\r\n   lost no man in the action; eight only wounded, all doing well;\r\n   amongst which number is Mr. Mansell, from a contusion in his\r\n   right shoulder by splinter. Our main and mizen-top-masts are\r\n   alone disabled, and the hull has not suffered materially. All\r\n   the officers, and every man individually, behaved as nobly as I\r\n   have ever witnessed; and you know it is not the first action in\r\n   which I have seen courage excited.\r\n\r\n   This is copied from the letter I write to my brother. My\r\n   amanuensis is a gentleman who acted as my aide-de-camp, and I\r\n   beg you will acquaint his good father that he acquitted himself\r\n   highly to my satisfaction, and showed himself deserving the\r\n   stock from which he sprung. I truly hope in due time to have the\r\n   opportunity of advancing a young man of his merit.\r\n\r\n   In case I have not time to write to my brother, as the above has\r\n   been copied only from the scraps of the letter I intended\r\n   writing, send him this letter, stating my great hurry and the\r\n   pressure of service at this crisis.\r\n\r\n   Adieu! nothing can equal my impatience to hear from you, and to\r\n   receive good accounts of my sister.\r\n\r\n   I am truly, most affectionately yours,\r\n   JAS. SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n   Lagos Bay, 17th February 1797.\r\n\r\n   The principal cause of my present haste is my anxiety attending\r\n   the care of the San Josef, which we have in tow, and which has\r\n   delayed us more than I can express, these twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n   N.B. I since have found it was the Santissima Trinidada, and not\r\n   the Concepcion, that struck, but afterwards got off. And the St.\r\n   Ysidro, 74 guns, and not the Santa Domingo, that is captured.\r\n   The Santissima Trinidada is reported to be off here by one of\r\n   our frigates.\r\n\r\nThe enemy, however, passed Lagos Bay, leaving the prizes unmolested.\r\nAs the further details, and Spanish account of this action, will be\r\nfound in the Appendix, we shall proceed by giving the copies of the\r\nfollowing letters.\r\n\r\n   Victory, Lagos Bay, 16th February 1797.\r\n\r\n   SIR,\r\n\r\n   No language I am possessed of can convey the high sense I\r\n   entertain of the exemplary conduct of the flag-officers,\r\n   captains, officers, seamen, marines, and soldiers embarked on\r\n   board every ship of the squadron I have the honour to command,\r\n   present at the vigorous and successful attack made upon the\r\n   fleet of Spain on the 14th instant. The signal advantage\r\n   obtained by his Majesty's arms on that day is entirely owing to\r\n   their determined valour and discipline; and I request you will\r\n   accept yourself, and give my thanks and approbation to those\r\n   composing the crew of the ship under your command.\r\n\r\n   I am, sir,\r\n   Your most humble servant,\r\n   J. JERVIS.\r\n\r\n   To Captain Sir James Saumarez, Orion.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this glorious victory, obtained, under Providence,\r\nby the valour and discipline of the crews of his Majesty's ships on\r\nthe 14th February 1797, the commander-in-chief was pleased to grant a\r\nfree pardon to James Maloney, seaman, then under sentence of death for\r\nrepeated desertion from H.M.S. Speedy, which was communicated in the\r\nmost impressive manner to the fleet.\r\n\r\nWe cannot but remark that, in the various accounts of this action,\r\njustice has been but barely done to the commander of the Orion, who is\r\nonly mentioned as one of the six captains who prevented the junction\r\nof the enemy's separated squadron. If any act of heroism displayed on\r\nthat occasion was designed to be particularly recorded in the public\r\ndespatches, surely the fact that the Orion was the last ship that\r\nengaged and took possession of the Salvador del Mundo, and then made\r\nthe Santissima Trinidada strike her colours and hoist the English flag\r\nover the Spanish, deserves a place. For these achievements we have the\r\nundoubted testimonies, not only of the gallant commander and the\r\nofficers of the ship, viz. Sir John Savage, Captains Tancock and\r\nMansell, but also that of one of the officers of the Spanish ship who\r\nwas on board at the time, and who added, that \"we did not surrender\r\nuntil all further defence was hopeless.\" The Orion could not send a\r\nboat to her, because she had already taken possession of the Salvador,\r\non board which ship she had sent her first lieutenant and as many men\r\nas she could spare, and also because she had no boat that could swim:\r\nbut this, it appeared, raised some doubts on the subject; and on a\r\nsubsequent occasion, when the captains met on board the Victory,\r\nCommodore Nelson said, \"It _was true_, Saumarez, that the Santissima\r\nstruck to you; the Spanish officers have acknowledged it.\" Sir James,\r\nsupposing from the manner in which this was spoken that Nelson had\r\ndoubted the truth of his report, answered rather sharply, \"Who ever\r\ndoubted it, sir? I hope there is no need for such evidence to\r\nestablish the truth of the report of a British officer.\"\r\n\r\nLieutenant Luce's description of the state he found the Salvador in\r\nwas appalling in the extreme.--There were more than fifty lying on the\r\ndecks with wounds requiring amputation. In many instances the Spanish\r\nsurgeon, after having separated the limb, omitted to tie up the\r\narteries; consequently, on removing the tourniquet, the victim in a\r\nfew minutes bled to death: and the English sailors, who at length\r\nstopped his merciless hand, were with difficulty prevented from\r\nthrowing him overboard with those he had butchered.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Luce was one of the officers promoted, in consequence of\r\nthis battle, to the rank of master and commander.\r\n\r\nThe fleet now returned to Lisbon, where the conquerors were received\r\nwith every demonstration of joy and gratitude. The English factory\r\npresented a congratulatory address; and at this place the thanks of\r\nboth houses of parliament were communicated to them; and a third time\r\nto Sir James, as one of the most distinguished captains. At the same\r\ntime he received from Earl Spencer and Lord Hugh Seymour the following\r\nhandsome letters of congratulation:\r\n\r\n   DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n   I congratulate you most sincerely on your having been present at\r\n   the most brilliant action which our naval history records, and\r\n   on having had so distinguished a share in it.\r\n\r\n   I am, dear sir, with great truth,\r\n   Your very obedient, humble servant,\r\n   Admiralty, 8th March 1797.\r\n   SPENCER.\r\n\r\n   Sir James Saumarez.\r\n\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR SIR JAMES,\r\n\r\n   I congratulate you most heartily on your having had another\r\n   opportunity of displaying your merit, and on the share which you\r\n   bore in the most brilliant action that ever was achieved.\r\n\r\n   I hope that I need not assure you how much I have shared with\r\n   your friends the satisfaction your conduct has given them; the\r\n   reward for which, I hope, you will long enjoy in the approbation\r\n   of the whole world, which is now bestowed upon you.\r\n\r\n   I am, my dear Sir James,\r\n   Most truly and faithfully yours,\r\n   H. SEYMOUR.\r\n\r\n   Admiralty, March 10th, 1797.\r\n\r\nEarly in March the Orion was again ready for active service; and the\r\nfollowing letter gives an account of the departure of Sir James\r\nSaumarez with Commodore Nelson on a cruize.\r\n\r\n   Orion, off the Tagus, 6th March 1797.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR RICHARD,\r\n\r\n   I had the pleasure of your letter by packet, and I have to tell\r\n   you we are now actually under sail, with Commodore Nelson, in\r\n   the Irresistible, the Leander, and some frigates, going to\r\n   intercept several Spanish ships expected from Vera Cruz with\r\n   rich cargoes. Be not surprised if, with our _desperate_\r\n   commodore, you hear of our taking the whole Spanish fleet,\r\n   should we fall in with them. Our cruise is expected to last only\r\n   three weeks.\r\n\r\n   I hope on our return to receive letters from my friends, in\r\n   reply to those I sent by the Lively. I shall thank you, when you\r\n   see our friends in Walbrook, if you will mention to them that\r\n   all my brother officers are extremely incensed at the opinion\r\n   given by Sir William Scott on the case of the Kingston; and we\r\n   hope he will have found reason to alter it. It is the\r\n   circumstance, and not the value of the salvage, that has\r\n   displeased us so much.\r\n\r\n   We are just going over the Bar, so I must conclude with my\r\n   sincere and best wishes for health and every happiness to attend\r\n   you, my dear sister and family,\r\n\r\n   I am ever, my dear Richard,\r\n   Affectionately yours,\r\n   JAS. SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\nThis short cruize was, however, an unsuccessful one; and the commodore\r\nhad not yet an opportunity of displaying his valour. They returned to\r\nLisbon, and found that their commander-in-chief had become Earl St.\r\nVincent, and that Nelson had received the grand cross of the Bath;\r\nwhile Saumarez was among those on whom was bestowed a gold medal for\r\ntheir gallant conduct on Valentine's Day.\r\n\r\nA reinforcement had now arrived from England; and the whole fleet,\r\nconsisting of twenty-one sail of the line, resumed the blockade of\r\nCadiz, where they arrived on the 2nd of April, and found there the\r\nwhole Spanish fleet of twenty-six sail of the line. Sir Horatio\r\nNelson, who at first commanded the advanced squadron, was ordered up\r\nto Elba; and Sir James, in the Orion, succeeded in his room; during\r\nwhich time the two Spanish frigates Nimfa and Elena were captured by\r\nthe Irresistible, Captain Martin, who chased them by signal from the\r\nOrion. Sir James on this occasion sent a flag of truce, and entered\r\ninto correspondence with the Spanish admiral Mazarredo; which, we need\r\nonly add, completely succeeded, and met with the high approbation of\r\nthe commander-in-chief, as will appear from the following extracts of\r\nletters from Earl St. Vincent to Saumarez.\r\n\r\n   Ville de Paris, 11th May 1797.\r\n\r\n   You approve yourself so able in the diplomatique, that you need\r\n   no assistance from me: in truth, a better despatch could not\r\n   have been penn'd than yours of yesterday to Don Joseph De\r\n   Mazarredo.\r\n\r\n\r\n   13th May.\r\n\r\n   I very much admire your last letter to Mazarredo, as I have done\r\n   all the former.\r\n\r\n\r\n   27th May.\r\n\r\n   I like your letter so much better than mine, of which I enclose\r\n   a copy, that I desire you will send it on immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Ville de Paris, 30th May 1797.\r\n\r\n   It is impossible for any man to have acquitted himself with\r\n   greater ability than you have done during the time you commanded\r\n   the blockade; for which I return you my best thanks. Your last\r\n   letter to Mazarredo is a masterpiece; and you will perceive, by\r\n   the enclosed copy of my letter to him, in answer to his comment\r\n   on our suspicion about the seamen from Trinidad, that I profited\r\n   by your hint relative to the prisoners landed at Lagos. Your\r\n   lash on the destruction of the Spanish ships he bears with\r\n   Spanish stoicism: _nous verrons_.\r\n\r\nThe following communication from Sir James Saumarez to the\r\ncommander-in-chief will elucidate the foregoing extracts:\r\n\r\n   (Secret.) Orion, 27th May, 1797.\r\n\r\n   Seeing the cutter on her way to the advanced squadron this\r\n   morning, I waited to send the flag of truce till she joined. I\r\n   had prepared the enclosed for Don Mazarredo, but was happy to\r\n   find you had been pleased to take up the business. I therefore\r\n   confined my letter solely to the certificates for the seven men\r\n   taken in the two Spanish barks.--In a former letter, you were\r\n   pleased to advert to a proposed descent when the troops joined\r\n   from Gibraltar. I hope you will excuse the zeal that urges me to\r\n   observe, that if possession was taken of Fort St. Mary, it would\r\n   in a great degree leave us masters of the entrance of Cadiz, and\r\n   enable us to drive all the outward ships up the harbour, and\r\n   possibly destroy some of them. I am extremely obliged to you for\r\n   permitting the Flora to remain with the advanced squadron, where\r\n   she is of the greatest service.\r\n\r\n   I am with great respect, &c.\r\n   JAMES SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\nThe high opinion entertained by Nelson of the great talent and zeal of\r\nSaumarez, is evidenced in the following short, but characteristic\r\nepistle:\r\n\r\n   Theseus, June 9th 1797.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR SIR JAMES,\r\n\r\n   Send, I beg, whatever you think fit towards San Lucar: all you\r\n   do is right, and can hardly want my sanction. I hope your boats\r\n   will be rewarded for their trouble; they take all the prizes for\r\n   our squadron.\r\n\r\n   Believe me, ever yours most faithfully,\r\n   To Sir James Saumarez.\r\n   HORATIO NELSON.\r\n\r\nThe following letter to his brother in London gives an interesting\r\naccount of the proceedings of Sir James Saumarez.\r\n\r\n   Orion, off Cadiz, 26th May, 1797.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR RICHARD,\r\n\r\n   I had the happiness to receive your kind letter of the 2nd\r\n   yesterday, with several of nearly the same date, from Bath, and\r\n   from our friends in the island. Having been near two months\r\n   without hearing from you, and knowing you had been ill, you will\r\n   readily suppose I was anxious for your letter. You will have\r\n   heard from me by various opportunities since we sailed from the\r\n   Tagus; my last acquainting you that I was entrusted with the\r\n   command of the advanced squadron for effecting the blockade of\r\n   Cadiz. We find, from different accounts, that the inhabitants\r\n   feel great distress from the interruption of their trade, and\r\n   begin to be in great want of provisions and other articles. We\r\n   have detained a few neutrals laden with Spanish property, and\r\n   two or three Spanish vessels; but as the whole fleet partake of\r\n   them, they will not be very productive.\r\n\r\n   Sir Horatio, now Rear-admiral Nelson, joined the fleet\r\n   yesterday, having left the troops he brought from Elba at\r\n   Gibraltar. I know not whether he is to resume the command of the\r\n   advanced squadron. All the fleet are anchored about five miles\r\n   from us, and we lie between them and the entrance of Cadiz.\r\n\r\n   All private accounts from England agree with you in the prospect\r\n   of peace; and they are corroborated by those we occasionally\r\n   receive from Cadiz. It is certain that the Spaniards are\r\n   extremely tired with the war; and they are apprehensive of\r\n   insurrection amongst themselves. Mazarredo, who commands their\r\n   fleet, went off for Madrid a fortnight ago, and, it is said, to\r\n   represent the state of the fleet, and its insufficiency to cope\r\n   with ours.\r\n\r\n   We understand Lord H. Seymour is off Cape St. Vincent, and that\r\n   Admiral Frederick is on his way with five sail of the line. It\r\n   looks as if ministers meant to back the negociation with all\r\n   their force.\r\n\r\n   The Admiralty order respecting the increase of wages, &c. has\r\n   been read to the different ships' companies; and I am happy to\r\n   observe that in my ship no part of their conduct has hitherto\r\n   shown the least appearance of discontent. It is much to be\r\n   lamented that the disturbance which prevailed in the Channel\r\n   fleet was not timely prevented, as the same spirit of\r\n   disaffection may hereafter show itself when it may not be so\r\n   easily suppressed.\r\n\r\n   We begin to want the luxuries, yet abound in the essentials of\r\n   life,--having plenty of beef, mutton, fowls, &c. Seriously, I\r\n   have not had above twelve men in the sicklist since I left\r\n   Lisbon, and most of them slight complaints.\r\n\r\n   I want to hear that my sister has _dreamt_ of another\r\n   action,--or, what is still better, of galleons! It must be soon,\r\n   or the approaching peace will oblige us to restore what we may\r\n   capture. I am happy to hear from my brother Thomas that things\r\n   go on prosperously at Guernsey, and that he does not fear the\r\n   French, though the two regiments are taken from him.\r\n\r\n   Adieu, my dear Richard!\r\n   Affectionately yours,\r\n   JAS. SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\nNo part of the career of Sir James Saumarez is more deserving of\r\nadmiration than his conduct on the unfortunate disaffection which took\r\nplace in His Majesty's fleet; a calamity gently alluded to in the\r\nabove letter. This circumstance, which must ever redound to his\r\nhonour, was entirely owing to the high state of discipline of the\r\ncrew in his own ship, and to their unalterable attachment to their\r\ncommander, under whom the greatest part had served since the\r\ncommencement of the war. It was from a perfect knowledge of that\r\nloyalty of spirit in which he justly confided, that he consented to\r\nreceive from the Prince George one of the worst of the mutineers in\r\nthat ship, who was to have been tried for his life. The seasonable\r\nadmonition which this man received from Sir James, and the attention\r\npaid to his situation and feelings, had the desired effect of working\r\na complete change in his conduct, and from being one of the most\r\nhardened of the mutineers, he soon became one of the most loyal, as he\r\nwas one of the bravest of English sailors. It was only three days\r\nafter he came on board that the signal was made for a boat from each\r\nship to attend the execution of three of the mutineers on board the\r\nPrince George; which Earl St. Vincent, by a well-timed decision, had\r\nordered to take place very soon after the sentence, and while the\r\nin-shore squadron were actually engaged with the enemy. He directed,\r\nmoreover, that this duty should be performed entirely by their own\r\nship's crew.\r\n\r\nSir James availed himself of this trying occasion to work out the\r\nman's full conversion. Instead of sending him, as it is customary to\r\nsend culprits, in the boats to witness the execution of his shipmates,\r\nhe ordered him into his cabin, and having represented in the mildest\r\nand most feeling terms the heinousness of the crime which he was known\r\nto have committed, he assured him that it was his intention to spare\r\nhim the anguish he must endure of beholding his late companions\r\nsuffering the last penalty of the law for the very crime of which he\r\nhad been guilty.\r\n\r\nThis well-timed exhortation had the desired effect. The penitent man\r\nfell on his knees, and with tears in his eyes acknowledged the\r\nheinousness of his offence, and expressed the strongest protestations\r\nof future loyalty, and of gratitude as well as attachment to his\r\nhumane commander. What followed was most creditable to both. The man\r\nnot only kept his word, but highly distinguished himself: at the\r\nbattle of the Nile he was captain of a gun, and, after the action, was\r\nvery instrumental, from his exertions and ability as carpenter's mate,\r\nin saving the Peuple Souverain, which struck to the Orion. Being one\r\nof those who took possession of the former ship, he was slung over the\r\nside, and successfully employed in stopping the shot-holes under water\r\nas the vessel rolled in the opposite direction;--a dangerous service,\r\nwhich requires much intrepidity and address.\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, by no means surprising that the spirit of mutiny never\r\nappeared in the Orion, or in any ship Sir James commanded. The proper\r\ndegree of discipline which was always maintained--the attention that\r\nwas invariably paid to the wants and the comforts of the crew,--the\r\nexcellent regulations of his ship, which were subversive of every kind\r\nof vice and immorality,--his own unaffected piety, and, lastly, the\r\nexample he himself set before his officers and men,--established in\r\nhis ship a feeling of respect for, and warm attachment to, the captain\r\nwhich could not be shaken by any artifice of the wicked; for every\r\nofficer and man looked up habitually to their commander as their\r\n_best_ friend and adviser. There may, indeed, have been some ships,\r\nwherein the crews were made up from the metropolitan and other\r\nprisons, that no treatment would have brought under proper discipline;\r\nbut we may confidently assert, that had all the ships in His Majesty's\r\nfleets been commanded by such officers as Saumarez, the disgraceful\r\nspirit of insubordination would never have been so seriously and\r\ngenerally diffused. The Orion's crew treated all attempts to seduce\r\nthem with just indignation!\r\n\r\nEarl St. Vincent being well aware of the confidence that could be\r\nplaced in the Orion at this critical time, kept her, for the safety of\r\nhis fleet, constantly at the post of honour in the advance; and it was\r\nduring this period of active and arduous service that a circumstance\r\noccurred which does honour to all concerned, while it particularly\r\ndisplays the humane character of Captain Saumarez, who was not one of\r\nthose that desired or permitted his officers and men to risk their\r\nlives on any dangerous or desperate enterprise without a mature and\r\ncompassionate consideration of the consequences.\r\n\r\nNear the fortifications of Cadiz, as if to guard the entrance of the\r\nharbour, about twenty gun-vessels had been placed, which it appeared\r\nto Earl St. Vincent might be cut out by the boats of the advanced\r\nsquadron; and accordingly an order was sent by the commander-in-chief\r\nto Captain Saumarez, directing him to proceed in _person_ with the\r\nboats of each ship to make the attempt. It was sufficiently evident to\r\nCaptain Saumarez, who, from the position of the Orion, had a better\r\nview of the gun-vessels, that they were moored there on purpose to\r\nprovoke an attack for which the enemy were well prepared; but, having\r\nreceived the order to command in _person_, he could not make known his\r\nopinions without appearing averse to risk his own life on an\r\nenterprise which the commander-in-chief thought advisable. Having thus\r\nin his own mind no doubt that the affair would be both desperate and\r\nbloody, he selected those officers and men who were unmarried for the\r\nservice, a list of whom he sent to the first lieutenant, with the\r\nnecessary orders to prepare the boats.\r\n\r\nThis list being exhibited in the ward-room, Captain (now\r\nLieutenant-general Sir John) Savage, of the Marines, had the\r\nmortification to see that his name was omitted, while those of the\r\ntwo subalterns of that distinguished corps were inserted. This\r\ngallant officer, who had been a sharer with his heroic chief in\r\nseveral actions, felt hurt that he was not chosen on this glorious\r\noccasion; and, having ventured respectfully to express his feelings,\r\nwas sent for to the cabin, when he was addressed by his commander in\r\nthe following terms:\r\n\r\n\"Captain Savage, do not imagine that your name is left out in the list\r\nbecause I have not a high opinion of your zeal and intrepidity. I well\r\nknow that you would be foremost in the assault; but I am also well\r\naware that this is a desperate enterprise: many will fall; and if\r\n_you_ should be one, who is to support your wife and family? The case\r\nis different with me: I am ordered, and my duty is to obey. Perhaps if\r\nLord St. Vincent knew what I do, he would not send us; but it does not\r\nbecome me _now_ to make any observation. However, aware as I am of the\r\nconsequences, I cannot conscientiously order you to accompany me,\r\nunder the conviction that your valuable life would thereby be\r\nsacrificed.\"\r\n\r\nThe entreaties of Captain Savage were in vain. He beheld with mixed\r\nfeelings of disappointment, gratitude, and admiration, his humane and\r\nheroic commander leave his ship at the head of the perilous enterprise\r\nwith that smile on his manly countenance which denoted a full\r\ndetermination to face every danger. The boats had not proceeded far\r\nbefore a storm arose directly off the land, against which no boats\r\ncould make way, and it was with some difficulty they regained the\r\nships. It was afterwards fully ascertained from various sources that\r\nthese gun-vessels had been moored in that position with rivetted\r\nchains, having no person on board them, in order to tempt an attack;\r\nand that the plan was, to let the boats take possession, and then open\r\na destructive fire from the batteries, which were kept several nights\r\nlined with troops for the purpose. Had not a merciful interposition of\r\nProvidence prevented the advance of the boats, there can be no doubt\r\nthat many, if not all the lives of the assailants, would have been\r\nsacrificed!\r\n\r\nWe shall leave the feelings of Earl St. Vincent, when the truth came\r\nout, as well as those of Captain Savage and all concerned, to the\r\nimagination of the reader.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n1797--1798.\r\n\r\n   Sir Horatio Nelson resumes the command of the advanced\r\n   squadron.--Bombardment of Cadiz.--Nelson sails for\r\n   Teneriffe.--Saumarez resumes the command.--Escorts a convoy to\r\n   Gibraltar.--Refits at Lisbon, and returns.--Conducts the\r\n   negotiation for exchange of prisoners.--Sir W.

The third attempt, which was to have taken place on the\r\n8th, was rendered abortive by a strong gale blowing off the shore.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th, Nelson having been detached with a squadron of three sail\r\nof the line, a fifty, and three frigates, on the unfortunate\r\nexpedition to Teneriffe, the command of the advanced squadron again\r\ndevolved on Sir James Saumarez. Nothing could surpass the zeal and\r\nintrepidity with which he performed this arduous duty. On the 18th\r\nAugust he escorted a convoy to Gibraltar, and having refreshed his\r\ncrew and refitted his ship, he resumed his duty off Cadiz, sometimes\r\nat anchor off the harbour, and under sail when obliged by the weather.\r\nOn the 15th November he was relieved, in order to refit at Lisbon, and\r\nentered the Tagus on the 25th, returning about the same day in the\r\nnext month to the blockade of Cadiz, which was almost entirely\r\nintrusted to him. Such indeed were his vigilance and activity, that\r\nnothing escaped during that period. He displayed, moreover, great tact\r\nand address in several communications with the Spanish admiral on the\r\nsubject of the exchange of prisoners, to the entire satisfaction of\r\nEarl St. Vincent, the commander-in-chief, who had always reposed the\r\nmost implicit confidence in his judgment.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of February 1798, the Spanish fleet were seen coming out of\r\nCadiz, and, in hopes of decoying them into the open sea, the English\r\nfleet retired to Cape St. Vincent; but it was soon found that on the\r\n14th the enemy had returned into port, being unwilling again to try\r\nthe fortune of war with such an opponent. The advanced squadron was at\r\nthat time commanded by Sir William Parker, who remained there.\r\n\r\nSir James Saumarez continued with the fleet until the 28th April, when\r\nhe was sent to refit at Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th May 1798, the Orion sailed from Gibraltar in company with\r\nthe Vanguard, Rear-admiral Sir Horatio Nelson,--the Alexander, Captain\r\nBall,--Emerald and Terpsichore frigates, and Bonne Citoyenne\r\nsloop,--with orders from Earl St. Vincent to watch the enemy's fleet\r\nat Toulon. When they were fairly through the Straits of Gibraltar, the\r\nfollowing order was given:\r\n\r\n   _Most secret rendezvous._\r\n\r\n   In the direct track between Cape Saint Sebastian's and Toulon,\r\n   in lat. 42 deg. 20' N. from twenty to thirty leagues from the Cape;\r\n   and, not hearing where I may be, in ten days return to\r\n   Gibraltar.\r\n\r\n   Given on board His Majesty's ship Vanguard, at sea, 14th May\r\n   1798.\r\n   HORATIO NELSON.\r\n\r\n   To Sir J. Saumarez, Captain of H.M.S. Orion.\r\n   By command of the Rear-admiral,\r\n   J. CAMPBELL.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th, off Cape Sicie, the Orion being sent in chase, captured\r\nthe Pierre, French corvette, which sailed the evening before from\r\nToulon, and obtained the following information from the prisoners,\r\nwhich was immediately sent to the Rear-admiral: viz. \"That the enemy's\r\nfleet, consisting of twelve sail of the line, besides six Venetian\r\nships, were in readiness to sail, with a great number of transports,\r\nhaving on board both cavalry and infantry, on a secret expedition. The\r\nFrench general Buonaparte arrived at Toulon ten days ago to command\r\nthe expedition, and was to embark in the Sans-culotte, (afterwards\r\nL'Orient,) which ship was said to have three thousand men on board,\r\nincluding her complement; almost all the line-of-battle ships had\r\ntroops on board. Three frigates,--La Juno, La Diane, and La\r\nJustice,--were seen by the corvette this morning, and sailed from\r\nToulon five days ago.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 19th a strong gale blew from the N.W. which being fair for the\r\nenemy, they sailed from Toulon, and, calling off Genoa, stood across\r\nto Cape Corse. This powerful expedition was found to consist of\r\nthirteen sail of the line, six frigates, and transports amounting to\r\nnearly four hundred sail, having on board, including the crews,\r\nforty-eight thousand men. It appears that, although not many leagues\r\ndistant from Nelson's squadron, the fleet did not experience a gale\r\nwhich blew with uncommon violence on the 21st, and in which, after\r\nlosing her three top-masts, the Vanguard lost her fore-mast and sprung\r\nher bowsprit; while the Orion and Alexander lost each a main-top-sail,\r\nand it was with difficulty they reached the Bay of St. Pietro in\r\nSardinia on the following day. Here the squadron had a narrow escape;\r\nfor, besides crossing the track of the enemy on the night of the 20th,\r\nthey, by being at anchor in this bay, were not discovered by a\r\ndetachment which the enemy sent in quest of them, and to which, in\r\ntheir disabled state, they must have been an easy capture. By the\r\nassistance of the Orion and Alexander the damages of the Vanguard were\r\nrepaired in four days!\r\n\r\nIt has been justly said by Nelson, that \"the exertions of Sir James\r\nSaumarez in the Orion have been wonderful: if the Vanguard had been in\r\nEngland, months would have been taken to send her to sea; here my\r\noperations will not be delayed four days, and I shall rejoin the rest\r\nof my fleet on the rendezvous.\"[12] Accordingly, on the 27th, while\r\nthe Orion was taking possession of a Spanish brig, the Vanguard and\r\nAlexander joined her off the port; but the frigates which had parted\r\nnever afterwards joined.\r\n\r\n  [12] See Clarke and M'Arthur's Life of Lord Nelson.\r\n\r\nThe following journal, written in the shape of a letter by Sir James\r\nto his family, detailing the proceedings of the squadron, and the\r\nevents previous to the memorable 1st of August, will be read with much\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n   \"Orion, St. Peter's Port,\r\n   \"Island of Sardinia, 24th May 1798.\r\n\r\n\"If the letter I sent you the 18th instant arrives safely, it will\r\napprise you of our being in the neighbourhood of Toulon, with every\r\nprospect of a propitious cruise. The squadron experienced blowing\r\nweather till the Sunday following, when it became more moderate; and\r\nin the afternoon a valuable vessel was captured, from Smyrna, laden\r\nwith cotton. This little success appeared the forerunner of our\r\nfuture good fortune; and we began to make exulting reflections on the\r\nadvantages of our situation. A few hours, however, convinced us of the\r\nfutility of all our views, and the instability of human projects: at\r\nten o'clock the wind began to increase with such rapidity as scarcely\r\nto give us time to take in our sails, and prepare to encounter the\r\ngale: at midnight we were reduced to a close-reefed main-topsail; a\r\ntremendous sea, and vivid flashes of lightning, convinced us that the\r\nstorm was not at its height: at three o'clock our main-top-sail was\r\nshattered to ribands, and blew overboard.\r\n\r\n\"The dawn of day presented to us a sad spectacle: the Vanguard without\r\na fore-mast, and her main and mizen-top-mast gone; the rest of the\r\nsquadron much dispersed, and the prize captured the evening before not\r\nin sight.\r\n\r\n\"Providentially the Vanguard was enabled to _wear_ on the other\r\n_tack_, as the sea was setting her fast towards Corsica, from which\r\nisland we were not many leagues distant. The gale continued with\r\nunabated violence until the afternoon, when it became rather more\r\nmoderate, but still there was a very great sea. This ship, with the\r\nAlexander and Emerald, kept company with the Admiral, and the latter\r\nparted in the night.\r\n\r\n\"The next morning the gale had considerably abated, and we were\r\nenabled to set some sail. The Admiral hailed me that he intended to\r\nproceed for Orestan Bay, in the island of Sardinia, and directed me\r\nto make the land, which we discovered at noon: but the wind would not\r\nenable the Vanguard, in her disabled state, to reach it before night;\r\nand Sir H. Nelson altered his intention for this bay, which we reached\r\nyesterday morning, though not without having passed a most anxious\r\nnight: the Alexander having the Vanguard in tow, within three miles of\r\na most dangerous coast, where there existed no possibility of\r\nanchoring, and with which we were totally unacquainted. This is a very\r\nsafe harbour, sheltered from any wind, very happily for us; as the\r\nweather has continued very unsettled since we are here. St. Pietro is\r\na very small town; and the island, as well as this part of Sardinia,\r\nappears very uncultivated.\r\n\r\n\"The governor sent an officer to the Admiral this morning, who very\r\ncivilly informed us that by a late alliance with France he was not\r\npermitted to admit us in the port; at the same time observing that, as\r\nhe could not prevent it, we might do as we pleased, but that he could\r\nnot give us _pratique_.\r\n\r\n\"We are going on in the equipment of the Vanguard with all expedition;\r\nand we hope the three ships will be ready to sail by next Sunday, Sir\r\nH. Nelson is happily very well, and has not lost his usual spirits.\r\n\r\n\"Friday, 25th.--Whilst I was on shore this morning to have some\r\nconversation with the governor, a sail was discovered off the island,\r\nand my signal made to prepare to proceed after her, supposing she was\r\nan enemy. We are however disappointed, it being a neutral vessel from\r\nCagliari, the principal port in Sardinia; and I am now returning to\r\nthe anchorage. I have great hopes my having been on shore this morning\r\nwill be attended with a good effect; the governor having promised to\r\nsupply us with oxen, sheep, and as much poultry as can be procured by\r\nto-morrow.\r\n\r\n\"Sunday, 27th May.--This morning my signal was made to chase a vessel,\r\nwhich I came up with and captured: she proved a Spanish brig from\r\nCagliari, laden with wheat. It was in contemplation to set fire to\r\nher; we, however, finally determined to send the people on shore, and,\r\nif they bring off the value of the corn, we shall restore her to them.\r\nThe Vanguard, being repaired of her damages, got under way this\r\nmorning with the Alexander. I was happy to find my negotiation with\r\nthe governor succeeded; and we have been supplied with the articles I\r\nmentioned, on moderate terms, both for the ships' companies and\r\nofficers, which is a seasonable relief, as Gibraltar supplied us with\r\nnothing whatever excepting fowls.\r\n\r\n\"I am not free from great anxiety lest the account of the gale we\r\nencountered may reach England before that of our safety shall arrive,\r\nand give you some uneasiness; but the experience you have had how\r\nnugatory all such fears are, will, I hope, make you banish them for\r\never.\r\n\r\n\"Monday, 29th.--The Spaniard not having come off as was expected, the\r\nAdmiral determined on sending the prize to Gibraltar. I hazarded a\r\nline by her for Mr. Le Mesurier; but we form no great expectation of\r\nher safety, from the great number of the enemy's gun-boats. A vessel\r\nwe spoke yesterday, from Marseilles, informs us that the French fleet\r\nput to sea, the 20th, from Toulon, with all their transports, &c.: as\r\nit was that evening the gale of wind came on, we have no doubt but\r\nthey must have suffered severely. By this vessel we have also several\r\npapers from Paris, the latest dated the 16th instant: they contain\r\nextracts from the English papers, which to us are very interesting,\r\nviz. the capture of the Hercule, the defeat at Marcon, Sir Sidney\r\nSmith's escape, and other important news, which, on the whole, are\r\nfavourable to the welfare of the country, particularly as regards the\r\nunanimity which appears to prevail in England.\r\n\r\n\"I dined, together with Captain Ball, on board the Vanguard: we all\r\nform great expectations of our future success, which, I trust, will be\r\nrealized. Certain it is that no ships could be ordered on a more\r\npromising service.\r\n\r\n\"Sunday, 3rd June--Nothing particular has occurred these last days.\r\nYesterday a vessel was spoken with, which mentioned having seen\r\neleven sail of the line, a few days ago, supposed to be English. We\r\nare at a loss what conjectures to put on this intelligence. We are at\r\npresent off Toulon: unfortunately, none of our frigates have joined\r\nus, and we are apprehensive they have returned to Gibraltar.\r\n\r\n\"Tuesday.--La Mutine brig joined us this morning, with the very\r\ninteresting intelligence of the arrival off Cadiz of the reinforcement\r\nunder Sir R. Curtis; and that Captain Troubridge, with eleven sail,\r\nwas on his way to join us: we look for him with the utmost impatience,\r\ntrusting in the Divine Providence to be in time to baffle the designs\r\nof the enemy, who, we understand, are certainly gone to Naples with\r\ntheir numerous army. I shall now go on with this journal with great\r\nglee, inasmuch as our proceedings are becoming of such very great\r\nimport.\r\n\r\n\"Thursday, 7th.--Nothing can equal our anxiety to fall in with the\r\nreinforcement. Our squadron has been, these two days, detached in all\r\ndirections, without falling in with them; and there is strong reason\r\nto fear they think us returned to Gibraltar. This morning the\r\nAlexander and myself chased two vessels, one of which we have just\r\ntaken possession of; she proves a Spanish vessel from Genoa, not very\r\nvaluable: the other the Alexander is still in chase of.\r\n\r\n\"Friday, 8th.--As this is in some degree to be a faithful account of\r\nour transactions, I must not conceal from you the deep distress I have\r\nbeen under at finding myself this morning parted from the Vanguard,\r\nand the Alexander almost out of sight; knowing how important and very\r\nmaterial it was, for the good of the service we were upon, that the\r\nsquadron should not be separated. It was not till this afternoon I was\r\nrelieved from the most acute anxiety I have ever suffered, by the\r\nLeander joining me, with the very satisfactory account that Sir H.\r\nNelson, while we were in chase, fell in with the expected ships under\r\nCaptain Troubridge, and which occasioned our separation. I am now\r\nunder full sail to join them; and have not the least doubt of being in\r\ntime to add my endeavours to promote the tranquillity of Christendom\r\nby the destruction of the enemy's fleet, which, I firmly believe,\r\ncannot now escape us.\r\n\r\n\"Our prize requiring more men than I can at this time conveniently\r\nspare to navigate her, I have consented to her being ransomed for ten\r\nthousand dollars, although, I dare say, worth more than five times\r\nthat sum. She had thirty-six ex-Jesuits (Spanish priests), who, after\r\nhaving been banished from Spain, had resided thirty-one years in\r\nItaly, '_et a present prevoyans le bannissement menace des ex-Jesuites\r\nEspagnols des nouvelles republiques Italiennes, retournoient chez\r\neux_.' Thus these poor wretches are driven about according to the\r\nprejudices of the times. She had also on board Swiss recruits for the\r\nSpanish army, eight of whom have entered volunteers in Captain\r\nSavage's corps, which I consider an acquisition: but no captured\r\nvessel ever gave so much uneasiness as she has caused me; and I have\r\noften wished we had never seen her, even had she been worth a million\r\nof money.\r\n\r\n\"Sunday, 10th June.--I had the great satisfaction yesterday to join\r\nSir H. Nelson with the reinforcement; and this morning the Alexander\r\njoined us, after having captured the prize she chased, which I\r\nunderstand to be a valuable ship, also from Genoa.\r\n\r\n\"We are now fourteen sail of the line, with La Mutine brig only; our\r\npresent anxiety is to gain information of the enemy's fleet, and to\r\nfind them where we can attack them. I hope to give you soon good\r\nintelligence of them, and speedily be the bearer of the good news in\r\nperson, as Sir H. Nelson has orders to send the Orion home, when he\r\ncan spare her. What a blessing if our present endeavours should be\r\ncrowned with success, and I have the good fortune to proceed to\r\nEngland immediately after; which at present is really intended, having\r\nseen the order from the commander-in-chief.\r\n\r\n\"Tuesday, June 12th: off Elba.--We have reached this distance without\r\nhaving been enabled to obtain any information of the enemy, who we\r\nhave reason to think are not far from our squadron: the winds have\r\nbeen very favourable to us, as at this time of the year calms are very\r\nprevailing. Although a long period has elapsed since I was on this\r\nstation, I derive great advantage, as well as satisfaction, from my\r\nrecollection of the different places we have passed. We are at present\r\nbetween Corsica and Leghorn, about fifteen leagues from the latter: if\r\nwe do not hear anything of the French fleet before we get to Naples,\r\nwe shall rendezvous at that place; and, we hope, in time to save that\r\ncountry from the hands of our rapacious enemy.\r\n\r\n\"Thursday, 14th.--The Admiral has this morning made the signal of his\r\nhaving gained intelligence of the enemy, and that they were off\r\nSyracuse in the island of Sicily. This information has been\r\ncommunicated by a Moor that the Leander has spoken with. We are now in\r\nfull sail, with a fresh breeze of wind; and to-morrow we hope to get\r\nsight of Naples, in order to obtain more certain accounts of them. The\r\nofficers and crews in the several ships are all in the highest\r\nspirits; and I never remember going into action with more certain\r\nhopes of success.\r\n\r\n\"Friday, 15th.--I dined with Sir Horatio to-day, and find his\r\nintelligence only extends to the enemy's fleet having been seen off\r\nSicily. As he has sent Captain Troubridge in La Mutine to Naples, we\r\nmay expect to-morrow more certain accounts of them; but we have reason\r\nto suppose them gone for Alexandria, the distance from which to the\r\nRed Sea is only three days' journey. They may soon be transported\r\nthence by water to the East Indies, with the assistance of their ally\r\nand our inveterate enemy, Tippoo Saib; and with their numerous army\r\nthey expect to drive us out of our possessions in India. This profound\r\nscheme, which is thought very feasible, we hope to frustrate by coming\r\nup with them before they reach the place of their destination; and, as\r\nwe know them to have great numbers of troops embarked in their\r\nmen-of-war, they will become an easier prey to us.\r\n\r\n\"Saturday, 16th.--Calms and baffling winds since yesterday have\r\nprevented our getting within sight of Naples, although all the time\r\nwithin a few miles of that beautiful place; which you must suppose has\r\nbeen mortifying to an extreme. We are looking out for the Mutine. As\r\nsoon as she joins us we expect to proceed in search of the enemy. Our\r\nroute lies through a passage often celebrated by the ancients, \"the\r\nfamous Scylla and Charybdis.\" We shall have sight of Mount AEtna and\r\nother volcanoes, particularly Mount Strombolo, and other small islands\r\nformed by subterranean eruptions. We are at present in sight of\r\nVesuvius, at the foot of which Naples is situated; but we are at too\r\ngreat a distance to observe its fiery eruptions.\r\n\r\n\"Sunday, June 17th. The wind has favoured us this morning, and given\r\nus a good sight of the Bay of Naples; but at too great a distance to\r\nsee much of the city. The country around it, as well as several of the\r\nislands that form the bay, are beautifully interspersed with towns and\r\nvillages; the whole presenting a most delightful scene. At 6 P.M. La\r\nMutine joined us; and, from what I can understand from Sir H. Nelson,\r\nbrings him some information of the enemy's fleet. He has just hailed\r\nme to say they were seen eight days ago, but I could not distinguish\r\nat what place. We are again making all possible sail after them.\r\n\r\n\"I regret much not having been able to send a letter I had written to\r\nyou, and carried on board the Admiral this morning; _mais tu sais bien\r\nqu'il ne se met guere en peine d'ecrire lui-meme_, and he is so full\r\nof mystery at this time that he seems unwilling any letter should be\r\nsent but those he writes to Government. It shall go some other\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\n\"Tuesday, 19th.--This morning has presented to us a delightful view of\r\nMount Strombolo, from the top of which we plainly discern constant\r\ncolumns of smoke; and, although at the distance of at least six\r\nleagues from it, I can assure you, without assuming the privilege of\r\ntravellers in general, that I am very sensible of the sulphureous\r\nvapour produced by the volcano: at the same time, it may be necessary\r\nto observe, that the wind blows directly towards the ship. Strombolo\r\nis a remarkably high island, of a regular conical form, and may be\r\nseen at the distance of twenty leagues. It is about ten miles in\r\ncircumference, and, I understand, is inhabited by a few fishermen.\r\nUnluckily, the weather is too hazy to admit our seeing much of the\r\nbeautiful coast of Calabria, which is at no great distance from us.\r\n\r\n\"Wednesday, 20th.--We have now a pleasant breeze, which will soon waft\r\nus through the Straits of Messina, so famous for being the terror of\r\nthe ancients. An old pilot is just come on board, who reminds me more\r\nof the poet's description of old Charon than of a modern human being.\r\nI hope he is not come to ferry us across the Styx. The whole of his\r\ncrew have the same grotesque appearance. We can now discern the famous\r\nAEtna disgorging columns of smoke. Some distance below its summit it\r\nappears covered with snow, whilst we are here melting with heat. It\r\nhas indeed a most stately appearance; and the whole country of Sicily\r\nanswers everything that has been reported of it for its fertility, as\r\nwell as for the varied beauty of its scene: but I must recommend you\r\nto read Brydone's travels through Sicily and Malta, a writer who, I\r\nrecollect, gives a lively description of these different places.\r\n\r\n\"We have this day been regaled with a most enchanting prospect in\r\npassing through the Faro of Messina. It is not more than three miles\r\ndistant, and on each side lies the most picturesque and lovely country\r\nthat can be described. The ship was within a mile of the beautiful\r\ncity of Messina, where I distinctly observed some of the ruins\r\noccasioned by the earthquake in the year 1783.\r\n\r\n\"From what I have been able to learn from old Charon (who has just\r\nleft us in perfect safety), the French fleet are still off Malta; and\r\nit appears their formidable armament is directed against that island.\r\nAs it is a place of great strength, and as we are within two days'\r\nsail of it, with a favourable wind, I hope we shall be in time for its\r\nrelief, and add still more important exploits to many that have\r\nformerly been achieved in fighting for its defence.\r\n\r\n\"Thursday, 21st.--The wind has proved rather contrary for the squadron\r\nsince yesterday. We are still in sight of Mount AEtna, and only a few\r\nleagues from the nearest part of Sicily: the ancient city of Syracuse\r\nis discernible from the ship. To-morrow I think will bring us in view\r\nof the enemy's fleet, which will be a far more desirable sight.\r\n\r\n\"June 22nd.--I am just returned from on board the Admiral, where I had\r\nthe mortification to learn that a vessel, which sailed yesterday from\r\nMalta, gives the very unpleasing account that the island had\r\nsurrendered to the French, and that their fleet left it six days ago.\r\nThis intelligence has more than ever left us in perplexity as to their\r\nfurther destination. On the supposition that Alexandria, as we first\r\nconjectured, was what they had in view, we are crowding sail for that\r\nplace; but the contrast to what we experienced yesterday is great\r\nindeed, having made sure of attacking them this morning. At present it\r\nis very doubtful whether we shall fall in with them at all, as we are\r\nproceeding upon the merest conjecture only, and not on any positive\r\ninformation. Some days must now elapse before we can be relieved from\r\nour cruel suspense; and if, at the end of our journey, we find we are\r\nupon a wrong scent, our embarrassment will be great indeed.\r\nFortunately, I only act here _en second_; but did the chief\r\nresponsibility rest with me, I fear it would be more than my too\r\nirritable nerves would bear. They have already been put to the trial\r\nin two or three instances this voyage.\r\n\r\n\"I should observe that we saw three French frigates this morning, but\r\nthey were not considered of sufficient importance to run the risk of\r\nseparating the squadron in chasing them. The island of Malta will\r\nprove a great acquisition to the French; as well for its excellent\r\nharbour as for the immense wealth it contains: they will also get a\r\nfew ships of war and a considerable quantity of naval stores.\r\n_D'ailleurs_, the suppression of a useless order that encouraged\r\nidleness will be no real detriment to the cause of Christianity.\r\n\r\n\"Sunday, June 24th.--The last two days we have not gone less than a\r\nhundred leagues; and, as the wind continues favourable, we hope to\r\narrive at Alexandria before the French, should their destination be\r\nfor that place, which continues very doubtful. At the same time, if it\r\nshould prove that our possessions in India is the object of their\r\narmament, our having followed them so immediately appears the only\r\nmeans of saving that country from falling into their hands. I\r\ntherefore hope that credit will be given us for our intentions at\r\nleast. We have hitherto been certainly unfortunate, which has chiefly\r\narisen from the reinforcement not joining sooner; the French armament\r\nsailed from Toulon five days before Captain Troubridge left Lord St.\r\nVincent: another circumstance has been the separation of all our\r\nfrigates, which deprived us of the means of obtaining information. The\r\nday we were off Naples the French fleet left Malta, and it was not\r\nuntil we arrived off that island, six days after, that we heard of its\r\nbeing taken, and that the French fleet had left it; and then without\r\nthe least intimation which way they were going.\r\n\r\n\"Sir H. Nelson consulted with some of the senior captains, who agreed\r\nwith his opinion, that, in the uncertainty where the enemy were gone,\r\nthe preservation of our possessions should be the first\r\nconsideration. It may be worth remarking that our squadron was sent,\r\non the application of the King of Naples, for the protection of his\r\ndominions. On our arrival there, and requiring the co-operation of his\r\nships, the reply was, that, as the French had not declared war against\r\nhim, he could not commence hostilities; that if the Emperor declared\r\nwar, he would also join against France. Should his territories be\r\nattacked, he has to thank himself for the event.\r\n\r\n\"We must hope that in England affairs prosper better than in this\r\ncountry; they are certainly _en fort mauvais train_ in this part of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n\"Tuesday, 26th.--We are now within one day's sail of Alexandria, so\r\nthat we hope soon to know whether the French fleet are in this\r\ndirection; but having seen no appearance of any of their numerous\r\nconvoy, we begin to fear they are gone some other way. I was this\r\nmorning on board the Admiral; he has detached La Mutine for\r\ninformation. I hope she will not find the plague there, to which that\r\ncountry is very subject.\r\n\r\n\"Friday, 29th.--The weather did not permit us to get near Alexandria\r\nbefore yesterday. La Mutine's boat went on shore; and I find this\r\nmorning from the Admiral that they took us for the French fleet,\r\nhaving had some intimation of their coming this way. We have now to\r\nuse all despatch in getting back towards Naples; it is probable we\r\nshall learn something of them on our passage. The squadron has\r\ncaptured a French ship this afternoon, which we suppose to be from\r\nAlexandria. I have passed the day on board the Vanguard, having\r\nbreakfasted and staid to dinner with the Admiral.\r\n\r\n\"Sunday, 1st July.--The wind continues to the westward, and I am sorry\r\nto find it is almost as prevailing as the trade-winds. The vessel\r\ncaptured the day before yesterday was set on fire, after taking out\r\nwhat could be useful for firewood.\r\n\r\n\"Sunday, 29th July: off Candia.--A small vessel, captured yesterday by\r\nthe Culloden, gave some information of the enemy's fleet. The Admiral\r\nhaving made the signal that he had gained intelligence of them, we are\r\nproceeding with a brisk gale for Alexandria. If at the end of our\r\nvoyage we find the enemy in a situation where we can attack them, we\r\nshall think ourselves amply repaid for our various disappointments.\r\nThe Alexander also spoke a vessel which gave information; but, having\r\nhad no communication with the Admiral, we have not been able to learn\r\nthe different accounts: we are however satisfied with the purport of\r\nthe signal he made yesterday.\r\n\r\n\"Monday.--I find from Captain Ball that the enemy were seen steering\r\ntowards Alexandria _thirty_ days ago, and we are once more making the\r\nbest of our way for that place. I also understand that two of our\r\nfrigates were seen a few days since at Candia; it seems decreed we\r\nshall never meet with them. I am rather surprised the Admiral did not\r\nendeavour to fall in with them, as they probably have certain\r\ninformation where the enemy's fleet are, from vessels they may have\r\nspoken with, and they otherwise would be a great acquisition to our\r\nsquadron.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may now be stated, that in the mean time the French expedition had\r\nlanded the troops and taken possession, not only of Alexandria, but\r\nCairo; and that their fleet, consisting of thirteen sail of the line,\r\nfour frigates, two brigs, and several bombs and armed vessels, had\r\ntaken up a position in the Bay of Aboukir, in which, according to the\r\nopinion of their admiral, they could \"defy the British navy.\"\r\n\r\nAs a particular list of both fleets will be given in a subsequent\r\nplace, I need now only mention that the force of the British fleet was\r\nfourteen ships of seventy-four guns, one of fifty, and the Mutine\r\nbrig. The fleet was manned with 7,000 men; but as the Culloden, which\r\nwas not in the action, must not be included, the actual force may be\r\nestimated 6,300 men and 872 guns, while the enemy's force, actually\r\nopposed, may be reckoned 8,000 men, and 1,208 guns throwing a\r\nbroadside of one-half more weight than the British.\r\n\r\nOn the junction of the squadron, the following orders were given by\r\nthe Admiral:\r\n\r\n   Vanguard, at sea, 8th June 1798.\r\n\r\n   GENERAL ORDER.\r\n\r\n   As it is very probable the enemy may not be formed in regular\r\n   order on the approach of the squadron under my command, I may in\r\n   that case deem it most expedient to attack them by separate\r\n   divisions; in which case, the commanders of divisions are\r\n   strictly enjoined to keep their ships in the closest order\r\n   possible, and on no account whatever to risk the separation of\r\n   one of their ships. The captains of the ships will see the\r\n   necessity of strictly attending to close order: and, should they\r\n   compel any of the enemy's ships to strike their colours, they\r\n   are at liberty to judge and act accordingly, whether or not it\r\n   may be most advisable to cut away their masts and bowsprits;\r\n   with this special observance, namely, that the destruction of\r\n   the enemy's armament is the sole object. The ships of the enemy\r\n   are, therefore, to be taken possession of by an officer and one\r\n   boat's crew only, in order that the British ships may be enabled\r\n   to continue the attack, and preserve their stations.\r\n\r\n   The commanders of divisions are to observe that no consideration\r\n   is to induce them to separate in pursuing the enemy, unless by\r\n   signal from me, so as to be unable to form a speedy junction\r\n   with me; and the ships are to be kept in that order that the\r\n   whole squadron may act as a single ship. When I make the signal\r\n   No. 16, the commanders of divisions are to lead their separate\r\n   squadrons, and they are to accompany the signal they may think\r\n   proper to make with the appropriate triangular flag, viz. Sir\r\n   James Saumarez will hoist the triangular flag, white with a red\r\n   stripe, significant of the van squadron under the commander in\r\n   the second post; Captain Troubridge will hoist the triangular\r\n   blue flag, significant of the rear squadron under the commander\r\n   in the third post; and whenever I mean to address the centre\r\n   squadron only, I shall accompany the signal with the triangular\r\n   red flag, significant of the centre squadron under the\r\n   commander-in-chief.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               2d.

MEM.\r\n\r\n   As the wind may probably blow along shore when it is deemed\r\n   necessary to anchor and engage the enemy at their anchorage, it\r\n   is recommended to each line-of-battle ship of the squadron to\r\n   prepare to anchor with the sheet-cable in abaft and springs,\r\n   &c.--Vide Signal 54, and Instructions thereon, page 56, &c.\r\n   Article 37 of the Instructions.\r\n\r\n   HORATIO NELSON.\r\n\r\n   To the respective Captains, &c.\r\n\r\n   Mem. P.S.--To be inserted in pencil in the Signal-Book, at No.\r\n   182. Being to windward of the enemy, to denote that I mean to\r\n   attack the enemy's line from the rear towards the van, as far as\r\n   thirteen ships, or whatever number of the British ships of the\r\n   line may be present, that each ship may know his opponent in the\r\n   enemy's line.\r\n\r\n   No. 183. I mean to press hard with the whole force on the\r\n   enemy's rear.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of Sir Horatio Nelson's squadron are now brought down\r\nto the moment when their united, ardent, and anxious wishes were to\r\nbe realized. The disappointments they had met with during their\r\nhitherto fruitless pursuit,--the state of anxiety, of alternate hope\r\nand despair, in which they had been kept, had raised their feelings of\r\nemulation to a pitch far beyond description; this was soon to be\r\nmanifested by the endeavours of each to close with the enemy.\r\n\r\nNever could there have been selected a set of officers better\r\ncalculated for such a service; Nelson was fortunate in commanding\r\nthem, and they in being commanded by him. It is true, indeed, that his\r\nparticular favourite, Captain Troubridge, was intended for his\r\nsecond-in-command, instead of Sir James Saumarez; and the latter would\r\nno doubt have been sent home, according to the orders he had received:\r\nbut, with the chance of such an engagement as that which they\r\nanticipated, the well-tried captain of the Orion and his highly\r\ndisciplined crew could not be spared; and, although Nelson carefully\r\nconcealed his feelings towards Saumarez, they were but too manifest by\r\nthe chary manner in which he expressed himself on this and on former\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the before-mentioned information, the fleet bore up\r\nfor Alexandria; and on the morning of the 1st of August the towers of\r\nthat celebrated city, and Pompey's Pillar made their appearance. Soon\r\nafter was discerned a forest of masts in the harbour, which they had\r\npreviously seen empty; and, lastly, the French flag waving over its\r\nwalls. A general disappointment was caused for a short time by a\r\nsignal from the look-out ships that the enemy's men-of-war did not\r\nform a part of the vessels at anchor there; but this was soon\r\ndispelled by a signal from the Zealous that the enemy's fleet occupied\r\nthe Bay of Aboukir in a line of battle, thirteen ships, four frigates,\r\nand two brigs, in sight on the larboard bow. At half-past two P.M. the\r\nBritish fleet hauled up, and steered directly for them with a fine\r\nN.N.W. breeze, carrying top-gallant sails.[13]\r\n\r\n   [13] In allusion to this memorable event, Sir James\r\n   writes--\"When on the morning of the 1st of August the\r\n   reconnoitring ship made the signal that the enemy was not there,\r\n   despondency nearly took possession of my mind, and I do not\r\n   recollect ever to have felt so utterly hopeless, or out of\r\n   spirits, as when we sat down to dinner; judge then what a change\r\n   took place when, as the cloth was being removed, the officer of\r\n   the watch hastily came in, saying--'Sir, a signal is just now\r\n   made that the enemy is in Aboukir Bay, and moored in a line of\r\n   battle.' All sprang from their seats, and only staying to drink\r\n   a _bumper_ to our success, we were in a moment on deck.\" On his\r\n   appearance there his brave men, animated by one spirit, gave\r\n   three hearty cheers, in token of their joy at having at length\r\n   found their long-looked-for enemy, without the possibility of\r\n   his again eluding their pursuit.\r\n\r\nWhen the Admiral made the signal to prepare for battle, at half-past\r\nthree, the signal to haul the wind on the starboard tack, and for the\r\nColossus to cast off her prize, the Swiftsure and Alexander, which had\r\nbeen recalled from looking out off Alexandria, were carrying all sail\r\nto join. At five, the Admiral made the signal that it was his\r\nintention to attack the van and centre of the enemy as they lay at\r\nanchor, which was repeated by the Orion. At forty-five minutes past\r\nfive, he made the signal to form the line as most convenient. The\r\nfleet then formed in the following order:--Goliath, Zealous, Vanguard,\r\nMinotaur, Theseus, Bellerophon, Defence, Orion, Audacious, Majestic,\r\nand Leander. The Culloden was then astern the Swiftsure, and the\r\nAlexander to leeward, tacking to clear the reef. The Admiral hove to,\r\nto pick up a boat, and also the four next ships astern of the\r\nVanguard, which gave the Orion an opportunity, by standing on and\r\npassing them, to get up with the Zealous at about half-past six.\r\n\r\nIn ten minutes afterwards the signal for close action was made, and\r\nrepeated by most of the fleet; at the same time, the Goliath, having\r\npassed round the enemy's headmost ship, anchored on the quarter of the\r\nsecond; while the Zealous took her position on the bow of the former\r\nship; both anchoring by the stern. The batteries on the island of\r\nBequir or Aboukir, and the headmost ships, opened their fire as the\r\nleading ship approached; and they in return opened theirs on rounding\r\nthe advanced ship of the enemy's line.\r\n\r\nThe Orion, after giving that ship her broadside, passed round the\r\nZealous and Goliath; and, as she was passing the third ship of the\r\nenemy, the French frigate Serieuse approached, began to fire on her,\r\nand wounded two men. In reply to an observation of one of the\r\nofficers, who proposed to return her fire immediately, Sir James said,\r\n\"Let her alone, she will get courage and come nearer. Shorten sail.\"\r\nAs the Orion lost way by shortening sail, the frigate came up; and,\r\nwhen judged to be sufficiently advanced, orders were given to yaw the\r\nOrion, and stand by the starboard guns, which were double-shotted. The\r\nmoment having arrived when every gun was brought to bear, the fatal\r\norder to fire was given; when, by this single but well-directed\r\nbroadside, the unfortunate Serieuse was not only totally dismasted,\r\nbut shortly afterwards sunk, and was discovered next morning with only\r\nher quarter above water.\r\n\r\nOn discharging this fatal broadside the helm was put hard a-starboard;\r\nbut it was found that the ship would not fetch sufficiently to\r\nwindward, and near to the Goliath, if she anchored by the stern. She\r\nstood on, and, having given the fourth ship her starboard broadside,\r\nlet go her bower anchor, and brought up on the quarter of Le Peuple\r\nSouverain, which was the fifth ship, and on the bow of Le Franklin,\r\nthe sixth ship of the enemy's line. The third and fourth ships were\r\noccupied by the Theseus and Audacious on the inside, by passing\r\nthrough; while they were attacked on the outside by the Minotaur,\r\nVanguard, and Defence.\r\n\r\nBy the log of the Orion it was forty-five minutes past six o'clock\r\nwhen that ship let go her anchor, and, in \"tending,\" poured her\r\nstarboard broadside into the Franklin and L'Orient. The fire was then\r\ndirected on Le Peuple Souverain, until she cut and dropped out of the\r\nline, totally dismasted and silenced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n     EXPLANATION.\r\n\r\n     BRITISH.

Her stern-boat having\r\nbeen shot through, and the others being on the booms, it was\r\nimpossible to have recourse to the usual method of towing it clear:\r\nbooms were then prepared to keep it off. As it approached, however,\r\nthe current carried it about twenty-five yards clear of the ship.\r\nAbout half-past eight, just as the Peuple Souverain, which had been\r\nthe Orion's opponent, had dropped to leeward, a suspicious ship was\r\nseen approaching the Orion in the vacant space which the vanquished\r\none had occupied. Many on board were convinced of her being a\r\nfire-ship of the enemy, and Sir James was urged to allow the guns to\r\nbe turned upon her. Happily he himself had stronger doubts of her\r\nbeing such than those who pressed the reverse. He ordered a vigilant\r\nwatch to be kept on her movements; and when the darkness dispersed,\r\nshe was discovered to be the Leander. Distinguishing lights were\r\nhoisted, and the Orion continued to engage Le Franklin from fifty\r\nminutes past six o'clock to a quarter before ten. The action was\r\ngeneral, and kept up on both sides with perseverance and vigour, when\r\nthe enemy's fire began to slacken, and the three-decker was discovered\r\nto be on fire. At ten the firing ceased; the ship opposed to the Orion\r\nhaving surrendered, as also all the van of the enemy.\r\n\r\nPreparations were now made to secure the ships from the effects of the\r\nexpected explosion.--The ports were lowered down, the magazine\r\nsecured, the sails handed, and water placed in various parts to\r\nextinguish whatever flames might be communicated. The unfortunate ship\r\nwas now in a blaze; at half-past eleven she blew up, and the\r\ntremendous concussion was felt at the very kelsons of all the ships\r\nnear her. The combatants on both sides seemed equally to feel the\r\nsolemnity of this destructive scene. A pause of at least ten minutes\r\nensued, each engaged in contemplating a sight so grand and terrible.\r\nThe Orion was not far off; but, being happily placed to windward, the\r\nfew fiery fragments that fell in her were soon extinguished. Her\r\nvicinity to the L'Orient was the happy means of saving the lives of\r\nfourteen of her crew, who, in trying to escape the flames, sought\r\nrefuge in another element, and swam to the Orion, where they met a\r\nreception worthy the humanity of the conquerors. The generous,\r\nwarm-hearted sailors stripped off their jackets to cover these\r\nunfortunate men, and treated them with kindness, proving that humanity\r\nis compatible with bravery.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the action Sir James received a wound from a\r\nsplinter, or rather the sheave from the heel of the spare top-mast on\r\nthe booms, which, after killing Mr. Baird, the clerk, and wounding Mr.\r\nMiells, a midshipman, mortally, struck him on the thigh and side, when\r\nhe fell into the arms of Captain Savage, who conducted him under the\r\nhalf-deck, where he soon recovered from the shock it gave him: but\r\nalthough he acknowledged it was painful, and might in the end be\r\nserious, he could not be persuaded to leave the deck even to have the\r\nwound examined; and the part was so much swelled and inflamed on the\r\nnext day, that he was not able to leave the ship.\r\n\r\nAfter the pause occasioned by the dreadful explosion, the action\r\ncontinued in the rear by the ships dropping down which were not too\r\nmuch disabled; and Sir James had given orders to slip and run down to\r\nthe rear, when the master declared that the fore-mast and mizen-mast\r\nwere so badly wounded, that the moment the ship came broadside to the\r\nwind, they would go over the side, particularly the fore-mast, which\r\nwas cut more than half through in three places. It was therefore\r\ndetermined to secure the disabled masts and repair other damages,\r\nwhile the action was renewed by those that were not so much disabled.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the battle ceased in the van, by the capture of the enemy's\r\nships, Sir James, who was the senior captain of the fleet, ordered\r\nLieutenant Barker on board the Admiral for the purpose of inquiring\r\nafter his safety, and of receiving his further instructions. He\r\nshortly returned with the melancholy detail that Sir Horatio was\r\nseverely wounded in the head. At this period, several of the ships of\r\nthe squadron were still warmly engaged with the centre and part of the\r\nrear of the enemy's fleet. Sir James therefore sent a boat to such\r\nships as appeared to be in condition, with directions to slip their\r\ncables and assist their gallant companions. These orders were\r\nimmediately put in execution by that distinguished officer Captain\r\nMiller, of the Theseus, and by the other ships that were in a state to\r\nrenew the action. It has been already stated that the masts of the\r\nOrion were too much damaged to admit of that ship getting under way.\r\nIn the course of the day the whole of the enemy's fleet had\r\nsurrendered, excepting two ships of the line and two frigates, which\r\nescaped from the rear.\r\n\r\nSir James being unable, from the effects of his wound, to wait on the\r\nAdmiral and offer his congratulations personally, sent him the\r\nfollowing letter:\r\n\r\n   Orion, 2nd August 1798.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR ADMIRAL,\r\n\r\n   I regret exceedingly being prevented from congratulating you in\r\n   person on the most complete and glorious victory ever yet\r\n   obtained,--the just recompense of the zeal and great anxiety so\r\n   long experienced by you before it pleased Providence to give you\r\n   sight of those miscreants who have now received the just\r\n   punishment of their past crimes. You have been made the happy\r\n   instrument of inflicting on them their just chastisement; and\r\n   may you, my dear Admiral, long live to enjoy, in the approbation\r\n   of the whole world, the greatest of earthly blessings!\r\n\r\n   I am ever your most faithful and obedient servant,\r\n   JAMES SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n   To Sir Horatio Nelson, &c. &c. &c.\r\n\r\nFrom the character which has already been portrayed of Sir James, the\r\nreader will not be surprised to find that the Orion was the first to\r\nhoist the pendant at the mizen-peak, and thereby to show an example to\r\nthe fleet worthy of imitation, in returning thanks to the great\r\nDisposer of events and Giver of all victory for that which they had\r\njust obtained over their enemies. A discourse on this occasion was\r\ndelivered by the clergyman of the Orion, which must have made a great\r\nand lasting impression on the hearers; but the circumstance, which is\r\nmuch easier to be imagined than described, of a ship's company on\r\ntheir knees at prayers, and offering up a most solemn thanksgiving for\r\nthe Divine mercy and favour which had been so fully manifested towards\r\nthem, must have excited feelings in the minds of the prisoners,--the\r\ndemoralised citizens of the French republic,--which had never before\r\nbeen known to them; and we understand that they did not fail to\r\nexpress their astonishment and admiration at a scene of that kind\r\nunder such circumstances.\r\n\r\nAt ten o'clock, when the action had entirely ceased, and the Admiral\r\nhad received the congratulations of most of the captains of the fleet,\r\nthe following general memorandums were issued:\r\n\r\n   Vanguard, 2nd of August 1798, off the mouth of the Nile.\r\n\r\n   The Admiral most heartily congratulates the captains, officers,\r\n   seamen, and marines of the squadron he has the honour to\r\n   command, on the events of the late action; and he desires they\r\n   will accept his sincere and cordial thanks for their very\r\n   gallant behaviour in the glorious battle. It must strike\r\n   forcibly every British seaman how superior their conduct is when\r\n   in discipline and good order, to the notorious behaviour of\r\n   lawless Frenchmen.\r\n\r\n   The squadron may be assured that the Admiral will not fail, in\r\n   his despatches, to represent their truly meritorious conduct in\r\n   the strongest terms to the commander-in-chief.\r\n\r\n   HORATIO NELSON.\r\n\r\n   To the respective Captains of the ships of the squadron.\r\n\r\n   Almighty God having blessed his Majesty's arms with victory, the\r\n   Admiral intends returning thanksgiving for the same at two\r\n   o'clock this day; and he recommends every ship doing the same as\r\n   soon as convenient.\r\n\r\n   HORATIO NELSON.\r\n\r\n   To the respective Captains, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nCaptain Ball, in pursuance of orders from the Rear-admiral, directed\r\nthe negociation for landing the prisoners on parole. Such as were not\r\nFrenchmen were permitted to enter into the English service, for the\r\npurpose of conducting the prizes home.\r\n\r\nWe must refer our readers to the different accounts of this splendid\r\naction, which have been published by James, Brenton, Willyams, &c. for\r\nthe particulars which do not concern the Orion. But we cannot forbear\r\nto mention the gallant conduct of Vice-admiral De Brueys, who,\r\naccording to James and others, \"had received two wounds, one in the\r\nface, the other in the hand; towards eight P.M. as he was descending\r\nto the quarter-deck, a shot cut him almost in two. This brave officer\r\nthen desired not to be carried below, but to be left to die on deck;\r\nexclaiming in a firm tone, 'Un amiral Francais doit mourir sur son\r\nbanc de quart.' He survived only a quarter of an hour.\" Commodore\r\nCasa-Bianca fell mortally wounded soon after the admiral had breathed\r\nhis last. Captain Du-Petit-Thouars, of the Tonnant, had first both his\r\narms, and then one of his legs shot away; and his dying commands were\r\n\"Never to surrender!\"\r\n\r\nNeither must we leave unrecorded the heroic death of young Miells, the\r\nmidshipman, who we mentioned had been mortally wounded by the same\r\nsplinter which struck his gallant commander. His shoulder having been\r\nnearly carried off, and his life being despaired of, the surgeons were\r\nunwilling to put him to needless pain by amputation; but after some\r\nhours, finding he still lived, it was determined to give him a chance\r\nof recovery by removing the shattered limb. The operation was ably\r\nperformed by Mr. Nepecker, the surgeon of the Orion, assisted by the\r\nsurgeon of the Vanguard. The sufferer never uttered a moan, but as\r\nsoon as it was over, quietly said--\"Have I not borne it well?\" The\r\ntidings were instantly conveyed to his captain, whose feelings may be\r\nbetter imagined than described, and who could only fervently exclaim\r\n\"thank God!\" But his joy soon received a check. Many minutes had not\r\nelapsed before he learnt that this amiable and promising youth had\r\nbeen seized with a fit of coughing and expired!\r\n\r\nThe captains of the Mercure and Heureux, who participated but slightly\r\nin the action, were both wounded; Captain Trullet, of the Guerrier,\r\nthe ship most shattered, was unhurt, and Gantheaume escaped in a boat\r\nfrom the L'Orient.\r\n\r\nBy great care Sir James kept off the fever which threatened to be the\r\nconsequence of his wound.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 3rd, Sir James, finding himself sufficiently\r\nrecovered from the effects of his wounds to leave the ship, went on\r\nboard the Vanguard to congratulate the Admiral in person on the\r\nglorious result of the battle. He found several of his brother\r\nofficers on the quarter deck, discussing the merits of the action.\r\nSome regret having been expressed at the escape of the two sternmost\r\nships of the French line, Sir James said to the Admiral, \"It was\r\nunfortunate we did not----\" and was proceeding to say, \"all anchor on\r\nthe same side.\" But, before he could finish the sentence, Nelson\r\nhastily interrupted him, exclaiming, \"Thank God there was no order!\"\r\nthus turning the conversation, he entered his cabin, and sent for\r\nCaptain Ball.\r\n\r\nWhile Sir James was receiving the congratulations of his brother\r\ncaptains on being the second in command, no doubt being entertained\r\namong them that the Admiral would make most honourable mention of his\r\nname as such,--_an honour which he so highly deserved_, and which is\r\nusual in similar cases,--Captain Ball came on deck, and interrupted\r\nthe conversation by observing, \"Nelson says there is to be no second\r\nin command; _we are all to be alike in his despatches_!\"[14]\r\n\r\n   [14] We may here state that, on the preceding day, Captain Ball\r\n   had paid a visit to Sir James; and as they were discussing the\r\n   various points of the battle, he stated to Sir James, that\r\n   \"having been the second in command, he would, unquestionably,\r\n   receive some mark of distinction on the occasion.\" Saumarez, in\r\n   the enthusiasm of the moment, exclaimed, \"We all did our\r\n   duty,--there was no second in command!\" meaning, of course, that\r\n   he did not consider he had done more than other captains; and,\r\n   not supposing that this observation would come to the ears of\r\n   the Admiral. But, he afterwards thought, Nelson had availed\r\n   himself of this conversation, to deprive him of the advantage to\r\n   which his seniority entitled him, although he fully exonerated\r\n   Captain Ball of having the slightest intention of communicating\r\n   to the Admiral anything he could have supposed would be\r\n   detrimental to his interest.\r\n\r\nWe need scarcely say that this was eventually the case; but we may\r\nrelate the circumstances which induced Saumarez, without the least\r\nintention to offend, to make the observation at which offence was\r\ntaken. It was the custom of Nelson, when in communication or in\r\ncompany with the captains under his command, to converse with them on\r\nthe various modes of attacking the enemy under different\r\ncircumstances; and, on one of these occasions, Sir James Saumarez, who\r\nhad seen the evil consequences of _doubling_ on the enemy, especially\r\nin a night action, had differed with the Admiral in that plan of\r\nattack, saying that \"it never required two English ships to _capture_\r\none French, and that the damage which they must necessarily do to each\r\nother might render them both unable to fight an enemy's ship that had\r\nnot been engaged; and as in this case two ships could be spared to the\r\nthree-decker, every one might have his own opponent.\"\r\n\r\nIt would perhaps be deemed invidious to mention the individual cases\r\nof English ships which fired on each other in this action; but that\r\nthis did actually happen, and that many of our brave men fell by our\r\nown shot is a fact too notorious to be disputed. Moreover, had the\r\nfour sternmost ships of the enemy's line done their duty as they\r\nought, by slipping their cables soon after the action commenced, and\r\nmaking sail to windward, they would have made an easy capture of the\r\nCulloden as she lay aground; and afterwards, by doubling on the\r\nVanguard, they would probably have given a different turn to the\r\naffair. The enemy's ships being moored 160 yards apart, left space\r\nenough for the British ships to pass between them, and rake the ship\r\non each side, as the Theseus did; whereas, by anchoring outside, our\r\nsquadron had equally to suffer the raking fire of the enemy as they\r\napproached, without being able to retaliate in the same way, thereby\r\nlosing the important effect of two double-shotted broadsides, besides\r\nthe advantage of being anchored in shore, to prevent the possibility\r\nof the enemy _doubling_ on a disabled ship, or of their running on\r\nshore and destroying those that were vanquished.\r\n\r\nIt has been insisted on that Nelson, in omitting to mention the name\r\nof his second in command, only followed the example of Earl St.\r\nVincent; and this may have been the case; but it cannot justify his\r\nevident reluctance to acknowledge the position in which Sir James\r\nreally stood. Every officer in the service must know that, if Nelson\r\nhad lost his life, the command would have devolved on Sir James\r\nSaumarez: yet, in his public letter, he not only avoids mentioning\r\nhim, but he endeavours to represent the captain of the Vanguard as his\r\nsuccessor in that responsible situation. His great friendship for Sir\r\nThomas Troubridge was, no doubt, the motive that occasioned the\r\nsubstitution, and led to this injustice, which he carried so far as to\r\nremonstrate, in his private letters to Earl St. Vincent and Earl\r\nSpencer, against any honours being conferred on Sir James Saumarez\r\nwhich were not equally bestowed on Sir Thomas Troubridge.[15] When\r\nNelson's great popularity, at this period, is considered, it may\r\nappear less extraordinary that this request should have had weight.\r\nYet it cannot but surprise an impartial reader, in after-ages, that no\r\nhonours or distinctions, except on the commander-in-chief, should have\r\nfollowed a victory, which Mr. Pitt in the House of Commons pronounced\r\nto be the greatest on record.\r\n\r\n   [15] See Clarke and M'Arthur's Life of Nelson, vol. ii. p. 119.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of August, when Sir James returned from the Vanguard, the\r\ncaptains were assembled on board the Orion. He proposed the following\r\nresolution, which was agreed to unanimously:\r\n\r\n   The captains of the squadron under the orders of Rear-admiral\r\n   Sir Horatio Nelson, K.B. desirous of testifying the high sense\r\n   they entertain of his prompt decision and intrepid conduct in\r\n   the attack of the French fleet in Bequir Road, off the Nile,\r\n   August 1st, 1798, request his acceptance of a sword; and, as a\r\n   further proof of their esteem and regard, hope that he will\r\n   permit his portrait to be taken, and hung up in the room\r\n   belonging to the Egyptian club now established, in commemoration\r\n   of that glorious day.\r\n\r\nTo which Sir Horatio returned the following answer:\r\n\r\n   GENTLEMEN,\r\n\r\n   I feel most sensibly the very distinguished honour you have\r\n   conferred upon me by your address this day. My prompt decision\r\n   was the natural consequence of having such captains under my\r\n   command; and I thank God I can say that in the battle the\r\n   conduct of every officer was equal.\r\n\r\n   I accept as a particular mark of your esteem the sword you have\r\n   done me the honour to offer; and I will direct my picture to be\r\n   painted the first opportunity for the purpose you mention.\r\n\r\n   I have the honour to be, gentlemen,\r\n   with the highest respect,\r\n   Your most obliged,\r\n   HORATIO NELSON.\r\n\r\nWe shall conclude this chapter with the extract of a letter written to\r\nLady Saumarez by Sir James, which we have no doubt will be perused\r\nwith much interest:\r\n\r\n   Thursday, 2nd August 1798.\r\n\r\n   Happy am I in being enabled, through the mercy of Divine\r\n   Providence, to acquaint you with our having obtained the most\r\n   glorious and complete victory ever yet recorded in the annals of\r\n   the world.\r\n\r\n   Yesterday afternoon we discovered the enemy's fleet at anchor a\r\n   short distance from Alexandria. Although our squadron was not\r\n   collected,--the Alexander and Swiftsure being at a considerable\r\n   distance from having been detached to reconnoitre the port, and\r\n   the Culloden a great way off from having had a prize in\r\n   tow,--Sir Horatio deemed it of such importance to make an\r\n   immediate attack on the enemy, that he made sail for them\r\n   without waiting for those ships.\r\n\r\n   At sunset the action began upon the van and centre of the\r\n   enemy's line, and in rather more than two hours six of their\r\n   ships were completely dismasted, and the L'Orient, of 120 guns,\r\n   blown up. The action was continued all night with the enemy's\r\n   rear by the Alexander and Majestic; and this evening the whole,\r\n   except three, have fallen into our hands, and a frigate, which\r\n   they dastardly set fire to, and escaped on shore.\r\n\r\n   The loss sustained has been considerable in some of the ships. I\r\n   have to regret the loss of poor Miells, and of Mr. Baird, my\r\n   clerk, and of several good men. I received a contusion in the\r\n   side, which, though at first painful, is doing as well as\r\n   possible, and does not even prevent my going on with the usual\r\n   duty of the ship. Poor Captain Westcott is killed, and several\r\n   other officers.\r\n\r\n   The enemy have now obtained the just chastisement of their past\r\n   crimes, and Sir Horatio Nelson has the happiness of being the\r\n   fortunate instrument of inflicting their just punishment; in\r\n   which happiness all his squadron partakes. Fourteen of the\r\n   Frenchmen, who had the good fortune to swim on board the Orion\r\n   from the L'Orient after she was on fire, report that their army\r\n   were all landed three weeks since, and are at present in\r\n   possession of Grand Cairo; and that they have frequent severe\r\n   skirmishes with the Turks.\r\n\r\n   Our worthy friend Mr. Le Cras will lament with me the loss of\r\n   Mr. Miells. A better young man I think never existed. He lived\r\n   until this evening, and was the whole time perfectly resigned to\r\n   his fate, saying, \"he died in a good cause.\" Mr. Richardson is\r\n   also badly wounded, and my servant John Lewis, who you recollect\r\n   waited on us at Portsmouth; but I hope they will both recover.\r\n\r\n   I should observe that the Culloden, not having been able to get\r\n   to us before night, unfortunately ran aground; by which accident\r\n   we were deprived of the assistance of so fine a ship, and of the\r\n   exertions of Captain Troubridge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n1798.\r\n\r\n   Fleet repair damages.--Sir James receives orders to take a\r\n   detachment of six ships of the line, and five prizes, under his\r\n   command.--Sails for Gibraltar.--Journal of his tedious\r\n   voyage.--Arrives off Candia.--Decides to pass through a perilous\r\n   passage, and escapes the dangers.--Falls in with the Marquis of\r\n   Nisa, and summons the French garrison at Malta.--Puts into Port\r\n   Auguste, in Sicily.--Sails from thence.--Tedious\r\n   passage.--Letters from Earl St. Vincent and Nelson.--Arrives at\r\n   Gibraltar.--Reception there from the Admiral, Governor,\r\n   &c.--Sails thence.--Arrives at Lisbon.--Sails thence.--Arrives\r\n   at Spithead.--Paid off at Plymouth.--Remarks on his treatment,\r\n   and explanation of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fleet was employed in repairing the damages it had received, and\r\nin fitting the prizes that were deemed worthy of being sent to\r\nEngland. This occupied the whole week after the battle. On the 5th,\r\nthe Leander, having on board Captain Berry with the Rear-admiral's\r\ndespatches, sailed for England; and, on the 12th, the Emerald,\r\nAlcmene, and Bonne Citoyenne arrived. On the same day Sir James\r\nreceived the following order:\r\n\r\n   (1st Order.) By Sir Horatio Nelson, K.B. &c. &c. &c.\r\n\r\n   You are hereby required and directed to take the ships named on\r\n   the margin[16] under your command, their captains having orders\r\n   for that purpose; and to proceed with them with all possible\r\n   despatch down the Mediterranean. On your arrival near Europa\r\n   Point, you will send a boat on shore to the Commissioners'\r\n   office to receive any orders that may be lodged there for your\r\n   further proceedings. In case you find no orders at Gibraltar,\r\n   and learn that the commander-in-chief is off Cadiz, or at\r\n   Lisbon, you will join him at either place with all possible\r\n   expedition.\r\n\r\n   To Sir James Saumarez, &c. &c. &c.\r\n\r\n   [16] The captains of his Majesty's ships to take charge of the\r\n   prizes as under:\r\n\r\n     Orion         to take charge of      Le Souverain Peuple.\r\n     Bellerophon         do.}\r\n     Majestic            do.}             Le Spartiate.\r\n     Minotaur            do.

You are\r\n   never to separate from her without orders in writing from the\r\n   officer under whose command you are for the time being; and you\r\n   are hereby required and directed to put yourself and the prize\r\n   under the command of Captain Sir James Saumarez; and follow all\r\n   such orders and instructions as you may receive from him from\r\n   time to time for his Majesty' service.\r\n\r\n   Given on board H.M.S. Vanguard,\r\n   Mouth of the Nile, 12th August 1798.\r\n   By command of the Rear-admiral.\r\n   J. CAMPBELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus were Sir James's wishes and anticipations, mentioned in his\r\njournal of the 10th June, completely realized. After a distinguished\r\nshare in effecting the destruction of the enemy's fleet, he is\r\nreturning home triumphant with the hard-earned fruits of his labours;\r\nwhich were, however, not yet at an end, as will be seen by the\r\nfollowing journal of his tedious and hazardous voyage:\r\n\r\n   \"Orion, at sea, 18th August 1798.\r\n\r\n\"After having so well completed the journal I sent by Captain Berry,\r\nyou will not doubt the great pleasure I must feel in beginning the\r\npresent, particularly when situation and many other circumstances\r\ncombine to render it so interesting. But I have more to relate than\r\nyou are aware of; and in which I have been most particularly favoured,\r\nas you will see, when it comes in its proper place to be mentioned.\r\n\r\n\"First, I sailed from Bequir Road last Tuesday morning, with seven\r\nsail of the line and six of our prizes; leaving the Admiral with the\r\nCulloden, Alexander, Zealous, Goliath, and Swiftsure, and the three\r\nremaining French ships, which it was intended to destroy after taking\r\nout their stores and landing the prisoners. The Alcmene, Emerald, and\r\nBonne Citoyenne had at last joined us. As, however, they had not been\r\nwith the fleet, but had remained all the time in search of us, we were\r\ndisappointed of our letters, and _they_ at finding themselves 'the day\r\nafter the fair.'\r\n\r\n\"In falling light winds, we came again to an anchor, Tuesday noon,\r\nabout five miles from the squadron; which gave the ships an\r\nopportunity to get completed for sea, and afforded a night's repose to\r\nthe men. At eleven I was waked from a sound sleep with the account\r\nthat a brig which joined the Admiral in the afternoon was from Tunis,\r\nand had on board a hundred men belonging to L'Aigle, which had been\r\nlost some time before on her way to join the squadron; and it was\r\nadded, 'there is a large packet of letters for the different ships.' I\r\nsoon had them sorted, and out of about twenty for myself I selected\r\nfour from you, which were read with an avidity you will better\r\nconceive than I can describe; before I had finished a page of one I\r\nflew to another, and so for near an hour, till at last I found their\r\ndate, and endeavoured to read them regularly; but it was not till\r\ndaylight that I could bring myself to a sufficient degree of\r\ncomposure. Never were letters more welcome--never did any yield\r\ngreater joy and comfort; they have since formed my chief happiness,\r\nand will continue so to do until the end of our voyage. Had we\r\nunfortunately sailed one day sooner, I should have lost these precious\r\nletters: judge then how fortunate I think myself, particularly so at\r\ntheir having been preserved from the wreck of the poor L'Aigle; as I\r\nfind that several packages, &c. for this squadron, with the good\r\nthings you sent me, shared the fate of the poor ship; Captain Hay\r\nhaving written to me from Gibraltar that they were put on board her.\r\n\r\n\"Sir Horatio Nelson wrote to me that he had not heard from his family;\r\nbut, as Captain Nisbet came in the brig, he will give him accounts\r\nfrom Lady Nelson.\r\n\r\n\"I now come to the sequel of our voyage, having accounted for my being\r\nso _unseasonably_ disturbed from a sound sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSir James now received the following letters.\r\n\r\n   August 15th, 1798.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR SIR JAMES,\r\n\r\n   I am not very anxious to receive any persons of the description\r\n   you mention; they will all eat our meat, and drink. As they\r\n   choose to serve the French, there let them remain. I have not a\r\n   line from home, all lost in L'Aigle. You will get off in good\r\n   time, I dare say. I am sure you will not lose a moment off Cape\r\n   Bronte; the shoal extends six miles. If you favour me with a\r\n   line, direct it for Naples, where I am going to join the\r\n   Portuguese squadron. Zealous, Swiftsure, and the two frigates, I\r\n   have kept here as long as possible. Nisbet thanks you for your\r\n   inquiries. I send you a copy of my letter intended to be sent to\r\n   Mr. Nepean; keep it quiet till you get off. Wishing you health,\r\n   and good passage,\r\n\r\n   Believe me ever,\r\n   Your obliged,\r\n   HORATIO NELSON.\r\n\r\n   To Sir James Saumarez.\r\n\r\n   I hope Lady S. and all the little ones are well.\r\n\r\n   (Copy.)\r\n\r\n   Secret, for Sir James.\r\n\r\n   SIR,\r\n\r\n   Six of the prizes sailed yesterday with Sir James Saumarez;\r\n   three others, viz. Guerrier, Heureux, and Mercure are in the act\r\n   of repairing. In this state I received last evening Earl St.\r\n   Vincent's most secret orders, and most secret and confidential\r\n   letters. Thus situated, it became an important part of my duty\r\n   to do justice between my King and country, and the brave\r\n   officers and men who captured those ships at the Battle of the\r\n   Nile. It would have taken one month at least to fit those ships\r\n   for a passage to Gibraltar, and not at a great expense to\r\n   government, but with the loss to the service of at least two\r\n   sail of the line. I therefore feel confident that the Lords\r\n   Commissioners of the Admiralty will, under the present\r\n   circumstances, direct that a fair value shall be paid for those\r\n   ships. I have farther thought it my duty to tell the squadron\r\n   the necessity I am under, for the benefit of the King's service,\r\n   to order their property to be destroyed; but that I had no doubt\r\n   but that government would make a liberal allowance. I have\r\n   therefore directed such stores as could, without taking too much\r\n   time, be saved from them, and ordered the hulls to be burned.\r\n\r\n   I have the honour to be, &c.\r\n   HORATIO NELSON.\r\n\r\n   To Evan Nepean, Esq.\r\n\r\nThe journal of Sir James is thus resumed:\r\n\r\n\"We again weighed anchor, Wednesday noon; and although with a contrary\r\nwind, and ships in a crippled state, we had the good fortune to clear\r\nthe land in the night without accident, and next day lost sight of our\r\nships in the Nile. Since that period we have not made any great\r\nprogress; but we have no reason to complain, and I trust a favourable\r\nwind will in due time waft us down the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n\"_A present, un petit mot sur ma sante._ In the first place, too great\r\nexertion for two or three days after being under sail, certainly\r\nretarded my perfect recovery, and, added to the excessive heat of the\r\nweather, threw me into a sort of languor that required the three last\r\ndays' rest and composure to shake off. I am now, thank God! as well as\r\never; and when I consider that every day shortens my distance from\r\nyou, my happiness is daily increasing. I have much more to say, _mais\r\nen voila assez pour le present_; and as there is abundance of time\r\nbefore this can be despatched, _il faut le remettre pour un autre\r\njour: ainsi adieu_!\r\n\r\n\"Sunday, August 19th.--I was indeed surprised to find Lyme the place\r\nfixed for your residence; and, on reflection, approve of it highly, as\r\nI believe it is a very healthy place; but more particularly as I hope\r\nto send you a line in going up Channel, and possibly take you to\r\nSpithead. Judge, therefore, the _selfish_ motives by which I am\r\nactuated, and scold me if you can.\r\n\r\n\"I was happy our dear boy had reached home before the close of your\r\nlast letter, and am charmed with your account of him. Having\r\nunderstood that there is a good school in Dorsetshire,--I think at\r\nSherborne,--I shall not be surprised if you have placed him there for\r\nthe summer, and shall not think it a bad plan to have him nearer to\r\nyou. I am glad to find my letters from Gibraltar reached you, and hope\r\nthat one or two stragglers will also have come to hand before those\r\nfrom the Nile arrive. These last will induce you to believe our\r\ncruise less unpleasant than you seemed to apprehend,--more\r\nparticularly when you find it the means of bringing the Orion to\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n\"Your _P.S._ of the 11th of June is considerably later than any\r\naccounts received in the squadron; indeed, I find very few letters\r\nhave been received by any of the captains. The Lion, I understand, is\r\non her way to join the squadron; but I have reason to believe she has\r\nnothing for me, as she sailed before L'Aigle.\r\n\r\n\"The accounts from Ireland are truly distressing; but I hope\r\ntranquillity has long since been restored in that distracted country.\r\nWe have heard of the dreadful business off Cadiz; but as news from the\r\nfleet must reach home before we can be acquainted with them, I shall\r\nnot enlarge on the subject. Captain Grey, I find, is gone to England,\r\nwhich will have been an agreeable surprise to his amiable lady.\r\n\r\n\"Now for some account of the Orion and her crew:--In the first place,\r\nMr. Barker is on board Le Peuple Souverain, happier than a prince. Mr.\r\nWells becomes first, in his room; and, as I found it necessary to send\r\naway Mr. ---- at Syracuse, I should remain with only three lieutenants,\r\nbut that, in virtue of my present command, I appointed, the day I left\r\nAdmiral Nelson, our kinsman Dumaresq to that station, who acquits\r\nhimself with great zeal and assiduity. He will receive pay for the\r\ntime; but cannot be confirmed, from not having served the six required\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\"All the officers are in rapture at the share the ship had in the\r\naction, except her captain, who is never satisfied. The ship's company\r\nall healthy, and the wounded daily recovering. Sheep and poultry in\r\nabundance; but the fear of a long passage down the Mediterranean\r\nobliges us to be frugal, wishing, if possible, to avoid putting into\r\nany place before we reach the fleet off Cadiz,--a thing scarcely\r\npossible, and rendered still more improbable from our little progress\r\nthe last five days: however,--_patience_!\r\n\r\n\"I have only two French officers on board; one was second captain of\r\nthe Tonnant; they are both in the ward-room, and I occasionally invite\r\nthem to my table. Of the six prizes four are fine ships, particularly\r\nthe Franklin and Spartiate: the Souverain and Conquerant are both very\r\nold ships; Le Tonnant and L'Aquilon were built within these few years\r\nonly. Both the former are quite new. But it is not what we have taken,\r\nbut what we have destroyed. We have left France only two sail of the\r\nline in the Mediterranean, except a few bad Venetian ships and some\r\nfrigates. A squadron of five sail leaves us masters of these seas,\r\nequal to protect our commerce, and with a few frigates destroy that of\r\nthe enemy: these are the real fruits of our victory; and as to\r\nanything personal to ourselves, the approbation of our country, and\r\npossibly an additional medal, will be ample recompence to us. At\r\npresent my chief solicitude is to find things go on well in England;\r\nand I think, when the account of our action arrives, it will set the\r\nminds of people at ease for some time at least.\r\n\r\n\"I shall have a great deal to say to you, in which you will\r\nacknowledge with me that the Almighty has been kind and bountiful\r\nindeed, beyond my merits or pretensions. You will infer from my late\r\njournal what I particularly allude to, wherein I mention the Orion\r\nhaving been intended to return to the fleet on the junction of the\r\nreinforcement; which was merely to favour Captain Troubridge, with\r\nwhom I clashed from seniority. Very, very fortunately for me, the\r\nenemy's force would not permit Sir H. Nelson to part with me; and the\r\nsequel has shown the partiality of the Earl's proceeding: but of this\r\n'_ci-apres_;' only, for the present, judge what must have been my\r\nfeelings had I been thus deprived of my share in this action!\r\n\r\n\"My situation at this moment is exactly what I could wish,--the\r\ncommand of a respectable squadron escorting the trophies of our\r\nvictory; and I am induced to hope that I shall proceed with them to\r\nEngland without considerable delay. We have just gained sight of\r\nCyprus, nearly the track we followed six weeks ago; so invariably do\r\nthe westerly winds prevail at this season; but I hope we shall not be\r\nsubject to the tedious calms we experienced under Candia. Hitherto we\r\nhave always had a good breeze, which has prevented any intercourse\r\nbetween the ships of the squadron, one day only excepted.\r\n\r\n\"I have not told you that we all voted a sword to the Admiral before\r\nwe parted from the squadron; the captains having agreed to subscribe\r\nfifty pounds each to defray the expense, and to have his picture,\r\nwhich is to be put up in the room intended to hold the _Egyptian\r\nClub_, when we all meet in England. The overplus, which will come to\r\nabout thirty pounds each, is to be applied for the relief of the\r\nwidows and orphans of those who have nobly fallen in the action. All\r\nthis shows unanimity at least, and I believe greater never existed in\r\nany squadron.\r\n\r\n\"Wednesday, 22nd.--This morning the wind has set in very favourably\r\nfor us; but it is to the southward, and produces such a close, sultry,\r\nand damp air, that it is scarcely bearable; and, with all this, we\r\nhave to encounter so strong a western swell, that the prizes and\r\ncrippled ships, for want of more sail, can scarcely contend against\r\nit. What if we should have the good fortune to fall in with the four\r\nFrench ships! They are certainly on their way to Toulon; and, from the\r\nwant of water and provisions, must have put into some of the ports in\r\nthese seas. I _dreamt_ so much of them last night that I really form\r\ngreat hopes of our falling in with them. This leads me to mention that\r\nall the captains agreed to share together in whatever may be captured\r\ntill the 1st of October.\r\n\r\n\"It is now exactly three weeks since the Battle of the Nile; it\r\nappears almost an age; but when once we get in the fair track down the\r\nMediterranean, every day will, I hope, shorten our distance. We have\r\nseen but one strange sail since we left Bequir, and that at too great\r\na distance to speak with. I think it probable Sir Horatio may be on\r\nhis way to Naples, as he proposed to sail soon to join the Portuguese\r\nsquadron, taking with him the Culloden, Alexander, and Goliath. The\r\nZealous, with Swiftsure, and the frigates, were to be left to block up\r\nAlexandria, and distress the enemy. What barbarous people we must be,\r\nafter having done them so much mischief, still to add to their\r\ndisasters!\r\n\r\n\"August 24th.--I have been right in my conjectures this morning,\r\nhaving fallen in with Sir Horatio, who obligingly sent the Bonne\r\nCitoyenne with letters, &c. for the ships with me, brought by the\r\nSeahorse, which joined him at Bequir. He has only the Culloden and\r\nAlexander with him, having left the rest of the ships for the good\r\npurposes before mentioned. This meeting has afforded me an opportunity\r\nof sending you a few hurried lines, which I have requested the Admiral\r\nto forward from Naples. I have no doubt that the letter will reach\r\nyou some time before any other I can have an opportunity of sending\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n\"I think the few last lines will not be the less acceptable for having\r\nbeen anticipated. I can assure you their purport is highly acceptable,\r\nas I now have the Earl's own assertion for the Orion being ordered to\r\nEngland upon his own terms, 'when I join him with the prizes.' Alas!\r\nthey get on very slowly; but I am endowed with unparalleled patience,\r\nhaving scarcely uttered a murmur on their tardiness, so perfectly\r\nsatisfied am I with the prospect before me.\r\n\r\n\"I understand the Seahorse has taken La Sensible, and the Lion a\r\nSpanish frigate: _a propos_, we have received intimation that a\r\nSpanish squadron is on its way to Leghorn, to convey his holiness Pope\r\nPius the Sixth to some part of Spain; and, in case of our falling in\r\nwith them, we are to treat him with all the ceremony and respect due\r\nto the sovereign pontiff.\r\n\r\n\"Sunday, 26th.--I went yesterday on board the Admiral, for\r\nhalf-an-hour; and was happy at finding him in perfect health. He will\r\never retain the mark on his forehead which he has so honourably\r\nacquired; mine is not quite in so _distinguished a place_, but I also\r\nexpect to have a scar on my left side, or rather on the hip-bone,\r\nwhich was slightly grazed; but it is now perfectly healed, and I\r\nreflect with great gratitude on the very narrow escape I had: my only\r\nfear is, that it will give you great uneasiness when the account\r\nreaches you. I did not intend to have my name inserted in the return\r\nof wounded, but the Admiral desired it should; so that he must share\r\nthe blame if it should have alarmed you.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot tell you all the fine projects I form for some months at\r\nleast after my arrival in England. This last business has so shattered\r\nthe poor Orion, that she will not, without considerable repair, be in\r\na state for more service; and if I can be so fortunate as to obtain Le\r\nFranklin with my officers and men, she will be getting forward during\r\nthe winter months, and I shall have the enjoyment of your society all\r\nthat time: and I think, if it pleases God to bless our arms in England\r\nwith success, the enemy will be brought to sue for a peace before the\r\nspring of next year. Their great inducement for carrying on the war\r\nwas their hopes of success from this expedition, which is considered\r\nas entirely frustrated, as their army will be too much reduced to\r\nattempt to go to India without being reinforced from France; and they\r\nnever will be able to prevail on more troops to embark for Egypt, even\r\nif they had the means of conveyance for them.\r\n\r\n\"The winds prove all this time very variable, _et nous avancons fort\r\nlentement_.\r\n\r\n\"The Admiral is still in sight, though we are not in company together.\r\nHad I not been certain of going to England, I should regret losing\r\nthe opportunity of seeing Naples, particularly on this occasion; but\r\neverything is absorbed in that first consideration. The newspapers are\r\nat all times acceptable, and I was happy when you found opportunities\r\nto send them from Ryde; but as many of the squadron receive them, and\r\nthey are always circulated to the different ships, I would not trouble\r\nyou to send them. _D'ailleurs, pour le present, j'espere que ce serait\r\ninutile._\r\n\r\n\"Monday.--We get on very slowly indeed, not having yet got sight of\r\nCandia; we must however have _patience_. Three days' fair wind will\r\nbring us the distance of Sicily. I have invited Captains Miller,\r\nLouis, and Gould to dine with me to-day. To the former I said that\r\nyour ladyship had the pleasure of having made acquaintance with Mrs.\r\nMiller. Miller is an excellent man. Another day I shall have the other\r\ncaptains, Derby, Peyton, and Cuthbert, late first lieutenant of the\r\nMajestic.\r\n\r\n\"Whilst I am writing, a fine breeze has sprung up, which will get us\r\nas far as Rhodes at least. We have entirely lost sight of the Admiral;\r\nand I think, from the wind having favoured us, that we shall have\r\nconsiderably the start of his little squadron.\r\n\r\n\"Tuesday.--Nothing so uncertain and variable as the winds in this\r\ncountry. We are still off the island of Rhodes, which appears fertile\r\nand well cultivated. We have also sight of Candia at the distance of\r\nabove thirty leagues. Our present route is different from any of the\r\nformer, as we go to the northward of Candia, amidst the innumerable\r\nislands that form the archipelago. It is thought by many a dangerous\r\nnavigation with our disabled ships, but I always consider _que le bon\r\nDieu nous guide_.\r\n\r\n\"The Admiral has again joined us, but too far off for any personal\r\ncommunication. This evening we have effected a great object in\r\ndoubling Rhodes, and we are now proceeding with a fine breeze. I hope\r\nin three days to congratulate you on our being in the fair track down\r\nthe Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n\"Friday, 31st.--Events multiply and increase upon us, but not so\r\nfavourably as they promised when I last took up my pen. After\r\ncontending for three days against the baffling winds we had so often\r\nexperienced, and by our perseverance gained a considerable distance,\r\nthe wind increased so much against us yesterday morning, that I was\r\ncompelled, from the disabled state of several of the ships, to abandon\r\nmy intention of going to the northward of Candia; and, not without\r\ngreat risk, we ran through a passage imperfectly explored, and never\r\nknown to ships of war till we found it practicable: at the same time,\r\nI almost shudder at the danger we escaped; nothing but a case of\r\nextreme necessity could have justified the attempt, and Providence\r\nwas our guide;[17] at the same time warning us of the danger we ran,\r\nhaving actually seen the breakers, and escaped them by a trifling\r\ndistance; and this was performed late at night, all the ships\r\nfollowing and guided by our lights.\r\n\r\n   [17] Sir James displayed a remarkable instance of presence of\r\n   mind and unhesitating decision in this unexpected case of\r\n   extreme danger. Captain John Tancock, who was then lieutenant of\r\n   the watch, and who, having served under Sir James during the\r\n   whole of the war, enjoyed his perfect confidence, anticipated\r\n   the captain's wishes in volunteering on this occasion to go up\r\n   to the mast-head and look out for rocks, and thus considerably\r\n   relieved his anxiety. The prizes were quite unable to beat to\r\n   windward, and, in order to be extricated from the peril which\r\n   the shift of wind had occasioned, their signal was made \"to keep\r\n   in the Orion's wake.\" Sir James having determined to push on, as\r\n   the most probable means of saving his inefficient squadron, the\r\n   \"helm was put up,\" and orders given to steer through a passage\r\n   between islands, which was marked \"_doubtful_\" in the charts,\r\n   and in which shallow water was soon discovered by Mr. Tancock,\r\n   who gave timely notice to the helmsman on their approach to each\r\n   danger. The rest of the ships kept close in the track of the\r\n   Orion, and in this manner the whole of the squadron and prizes\r\n   passed between the islands and breakers without accident; and\r\n   there can be no doubt that their safety was owing to the skilful\r\n   and decisive conduct of Sir James. It is but justice to add,\r\n   that, in approving of Mr. Tancock's very meritorious conduct, he\r\n   emphatically assured him that \"he should never forget that he\r\n   had so fully anticipated his wishes.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are at present close to Candia, and the Admiral in sight; rather\r\nin advance of us, owing to the circumstance I have related. I now fear\r\nour voyage will prove very tedious, and that the want of provisions\r\nand other circumstances will compel us to put into some port; this may\r\noccasion great delay, which the approach of the equinox makes me very\r\ndesirous to avoid. I really believe no ships in so bad a condition as\r\nthose with me ever attempted so intricate a navigation.\r\n\r\n\"September 1st.--You are certainly unapprised of the Orion being on\r\nher way to England. Here have we been occupied for three weeks in\r\neffecting what might be accomplished in two days. Your wishes, I\r\nthink, would prove more availing were you acquainted with the real\r\nstate of things. This extraordinary delay makes me more fractious than\r\ncan be imagined, and I begin to lose the character for patience which\r\nI had given myself by so tiresome a situation; besides which, I have\r\nLe Peuple Souverain to drag after me, that causes me more trouble than\r\neven the Spanish _saints_ did after the 14th of February.\r\n\r\n\"Sunday.--I had almost determined not to resume my pen till we were\r\nentirely clear of this same island of Candia; but we have made such\r\ngreat progress since yesterday, and the prospect continues so\r\nfavourable, that I cannot refuse myself the satisfaction of\r\ncongratulating you thereon.\r\n\r\n\"I received last evening a letter from the Admiral, brought me by La\r\nBonne Citoyenne.[18] He is desirous of having the Minotaur and\r\nAudacious detached to Naples after accompanying us as far on our way\r\nas Minorca. A vessel was yesterday spoken with that saw one of the\r\nFrench line-of-battle ships, with the loss of her main-mast, and towed\r\nby a frigate towards Corfu, only eight days since; so that, had the\r\nwinds favoured us, we should have been at no great distance from them.\r\nI dined to-day in the ward-room; but I am sorry to say we had no\r\nchurch this morning; this is so very necessary a duty, that I am\r\nalways grieved when it is omitted.\"\r\n\r\n   [18] MY DEAR SIR, Vanguard, September 1st, 1798. From what I\r\n   have heard, and made up in my own mind, I feel it is absolutely\r\n   necessary that I should order the Minotaur and Audacious to quit\r\n   your squadron when you are in the fair way between Sardinia and\r\n   Minorca, and join me at Naples; and also with as much salt\r\n   provisions as can be got out of the ships victualled for _six_\r\n   months, reserving only one month's at whole allowance. My\r\n   squadron are at two-thirds of salt provisions, making the\r\n   allowance up with flour; therefore you will direct the same in\r\n   yours. I have put down the number of casks of beef, pork, and\r\n   pease, which can be easily spared if the commander-in-chief's\r\n   orders for victualling have been obeyed. Audacious is, I fancy,\r\n   short of salt provisions, not knowing of coming so long a\r\n   voyage. If you can manage to let those ships have any part of\r\n   their officers and men, it will be very useful for the King's\r\n   service; but of this you must be the best judge. Retalick will\r\n   tell you all the news from Rhodes, and I was rejoiced to see you\r\n   are this side of Candia.\r\n\r\n   Ever yours most truly,\r\n   HORATIO NELSON.\r\n\r\n   To Sir James Saumarez, &c.\r\n\r\n   Your squadron evidently sails better than Culloden. The\r\n   Bellerophon sails so well that Darby can take very good care of\r\n   Conquerant; and Aquilon seems also to sail remarkably well.\r\n   Remember me kindly to all my good friends with you.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Orion, at sea, 1st September.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR ADMIRAL,\r\n\r\n   Captain Retalick has just joined me with your order respecting\r\n   the Minotaur and Audacious, both which ships are to be detached\r\n   for Naples so soon as we are in the fair way between Sardinia\r\n   and Minorca, with as much salt provisions as can be spared from\r\n   the ships victualled for six months; which shall be duly\r\n   complied with. I shall also take from the prizes as many of the\r\n   officers and men as can be replaced from the ships left with me,\r\n   which I shall endeavour to be as near the full number as can be\r\n   thought prudent. Wishing to use as little delay as possible, not\r\n   to detain the Bonne Citoyenne,\r\n\r\n   I am very truly, &c.\r\n   JAMES SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n   To Sir Horatio Nelson, K.B.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Orion, at sea, 1st September.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR ADMIRAL,\r\n\r\n   After contending for three days against the adverse winds which\r\n   are almost invariably encountered here, and getting sufficiently\r\n   to the northward to have weathered the small islands that lie\r\n   more immediately between the Archipelago and Candia, the wind\r\n   set in so strong to the westward Thursday morning, that I was\r\n   compelled to desist from that passage, and bear up between\r\n   Sargeanto and Guxo, a narrow and intricate channel; but which we\r\n   happily cleared without any accident, the loss of a few spars\r\n   excepted, which are now replaced; and we are proceeding as fast\r\n   as the wind will admit to our destination. The ships are all\r\n   doing as well as possible; the fever on board the Defence fast\r\n   abating, and the wounded in Bellerophon, Majestic, and Minotaur\r\n   daily recovering. Seeing the Citoyenne on her way to us, I seize\r\n   the opportunity to give you the information.\r\n\r\n   I am, my dear sir, &c.\r\n   JAMES SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n   To Sir H. Nelson, K.B.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Orion, at sea, 5th Sept. 1798.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR ADMIRAL,\r\n\r\n   Since the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant, containing\r\n   an order for the Minotaur and Audacious to join you at Naples, I\r\n   have been employed in making the necessary arrangements for the\r\n   distribution of prisoners from the ships that remain with me. I\r\n   fear the quantity that can be spared, after reducing ourselves\r\n   to four weeks at whole allowance, will fall very short of what\r\n   you mention. The order for the ships to be put to two-thirds'\r\n   allowance was given the day after I received your letter. With\r\n   regard to the men belonging to the Minotaur and Audacious on\r\n   board the prizes, I hope to have it in my power to meet more\r\n   fully your expectations, as I see no reason why these men should\r\n   not be almost entirely replaced from the ships with me, the\r\n   Bellerophon and Majestic having only fifty men each on board;\r\n   the Spartiate certainly can spare the same number for Le\r\n   Conquerant; and I hope to man the Aquilon from the other three\r\n   ships, except the party of marines, which I shall direct to be\r\n   left on board of them. We have had favourable winds the last\r\n   three days, and I hope to-morrow to get sight of Mount AEtna. The\r\n   enclosed report of a vessel boarded by the Theseus makes me\r\n   regret the wind did not prove favourable a few days sooner, to\r\n   have come up with the strayed sheep.\r\n\r\n   10 o'clock P.M.\r\n\r\n   Captain Renhouse, in the Thalia, has this instant joined me on\r\n   his return from Bequir. I have taken his letters for the fleet,\r\n   &c.: and as the Flora cutter is in sight, closing with the\r\n   squadron, I have detained him till the morning, that he may take\r\n   from her any despatches she may have for you. I am happy to\r\n   learn from him that the Lion had joined the squadron off\r\n   Alexandria. He also informs me that the Marquis de Niza was on\r\n   his return from Aboukir, highly mortified at having lost the\r\n   opportunity of distinguishing himself in the action. I am truly,\r\n   my dear Admiral,\r\n\r\n   Your faithful and most obedient servant,\r\n   JAMES SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n   To Rear-admiral Sir Horatio Nelson, K.B.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Orion, 6th September 1798.\r\n   A.M. 7 o'clock.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR ADMIRAL,\r\n\r\n   The Flora did not join me till this instant, owing to the\r\n   commander's timidity. I was waiting for him the whole night. I\r\n   thought it my duty to open one of Earl St. Vincent's public\r\n   despatches, in case they might contain anything that might\r\n   render necessary any alteration in my present proceedings. I\r\n   find from them that Colossus is to the southward of Sardinia,\r\n   with the Alliance and four victuallers: we shall of course keep\r\n   a look-out for them. This information will enable me to keep\r\n   rather a greater supply of provisions than I had made\r\n   arrangements for, having scarcely reserved four weeks to each\r\n   ship of the squadron. I have charged Captain Newhouse with the\r\n   Flora's despatches, with orders to proceed in search of you\r\n   immediately, and also indicated to him the track I mean to\r\n   pursue, in case you should have occasion to send me further\r\n   orders, in consequence of your letters from Earl St. Vincent.\r\n\r\n   I hope you will do me the favour to believe that I have acted to\r\n   the best of my judgment for the good of his Majesty's service,\r\n   and that you will approve my having opened one of Lord St.\r\n   Vincent's public despatches; which it will be satisfactory to me\r\n   to know from you.\r\n\r\n   With sincere and best wishes for your health\r\n   and every happiness, &c.\r\n   JAMES SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n   To Sir H. Nelson, K.B. &c.\r\n\r\n\"Thursday, 6th September.--The last four days we have got on\r\nremarkably well; and, what is still better, the wind seems now set in\r\nvery favourably. Late last night the Thalia joined me, after cruising\r\nin all directions to fall in with Sir Horatio. I was not disappointed\r\nat receiving no letters by her: but this morning, having been joined\r\nby the Flora cutter, that left England the 26th July, and the fleet\r\noff Cadiz so late as the 12th August, I own it gave me concern to\r\nreceive no tidings from you; but, on recollection that all the letters\r\nfor this ship have been kept back, from our being expected down the\r\nMediterranean, my disappointment ceases.\r\n\r\n\"I have seen nothing of Admiral Nelson since I last wrote; and, as our\r\nroute now lies in a different direction, I do not expect to meet with\r\nhim again. The information obtained by the above vessels is of a very\r\nsatisfactory nature; and I trust things will soon, very soon, draw to\r\na favourable crisis.\r\n\r\n\"The Thalia brought me from Bequir several intercepted letters from\r\nFrance, taken in a corvette going to Alexandria. I have read several\r\nof them, and find that their chief reliance was placed in the\r\nexpedition to Egypt; which having failed so completely, must\r\ndisconcert all their future projects. One bad piece of news I have\r\nlearnt,--'that a Spanish vessel we took off St. Pierre, laden with\r\nwheat, has been recaptured by a French privateer.'\r\n\r\n\"I have been occupied for some days past in putting my cabin in good\r\nrepair, which I hope to have fit for your ladyship's reception, so\r\nthat, on my arrival in the Channel, I may have only to despatch the\r\nfirst vessel I fall in with to Lyme, with an invitation for you to\r\npartake of it, accompanied by one or more of the children, and any\r\nservants you may please to require to attend upon you. This has for\r\nsome time past engaged my attention, and I trust nothing will\r\nintervene to thwart my expectations. Alas! they have been but too much\r\ndisappointed already by the adverse winds, which still continue to\r\nweary our patience.\r\n\r\n\"I dined to-day on board the Minotaur, the weather having proved\r\nnearly calm; it is the first time since we left Bequir that I have\r\nconsented to leave the ship. I hope to fall in with the Colossus and\r\nsome victuallers, which I find, by the Flora, were on their way to our\r\nsquadron, supposing us to have been off Malta, blockading the French\r\nfleet. Strange that at so late a period Earl St. Vincent had not\r\nobtained information of their having sailed from that island!\r\n\r\n\"Sunday.--The wind always continues contrary; but we get on,\r\nnotwithstanding, by slow degrees. I made up for last Sunday, and had\r\nDivine service performed, and dined in the ward-room. We obtained a\r\nsmall supply of stock from the Thalia when she joined us; I should\r\nhave told you that I despatched her and the cutter towards Naples, to\r\nmeet Sir Horatio.\r\n\r\n\"Tuesday evening.--The wind has at last favoured us for a few hours,\r\nand to-morrow I hope to be in sight of Syracuse. A vessel was\r\nyesterday spoken with, that had an ambassador on board from\r\nConstantinople, going to the different states in Barbary, to direct\r\nthem to arm against the French. An English frigate had arrived at the\r\nSublime Porte with the news of the defeat of their fleet at\r\nAlexandria; but I am at a loss to conjecture what the frigate was. The\r\nFrench officers \"_sont indignes de cette insulte offerte a la grande\r\nnation_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thursday.--We at last gained sight of Mount AEtna yesterday evening;\r\nbut the winds still prove very contrary, and I fear we shall be\r\nobliged, much against my inclination, to put into either Syracuse or\r\nMessina: we are at present off the former place. By a boat that has\r\njoined one of the ships, I find they only heard of the battle four\r\ndays ago. They are disposed to give us a hearty welcome, but I hope we\r\nshall have no occasion for their well-meant intentions.\r\n\r\n\"Friday.--We last night fell in with the Marquis de Niza's squadron,\r\non their return from the mouth of the Nile. The Marquis hailed me that\r\nhe was _very sorry_ he had not arrived a few days sooner. We were much\r\nbetter without him.\"\r\n\r\nSir James sent, by the Thalia, the following letters to Sir Horatio:\r\n\r\n   Orion, Port of Augusta, 16th September 1798.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR ADMIRAL,\r\n\r\n   I fear you will be disappointed at finding that we are no\r\n   further on our voyage than this place. We were three days in\r\n   sight of Sicily, endeavouring to beat round Cape Pesaro; and,\r\n   Friday afternoon, the wind set in so strong to the westward,\r\n   that I was obliged to endeavour to get into Syracuse, but I\r\n   found the wind directly out of the harbour, and stood again to\r\n   the southward. It blew a gale all night; and in the morning,\r\n   seeing no possibility of getting into Syracuse, I bore up for\r\n   this place, where the squadron anchored yesterday afternoon. We\r\n   are completing the water with all expedition, but I am\r\n   disappointed that there is no wine to be had but at a very high\r\n   price. We are supplied with bullocks and other articles the same\r\n   as at Syracuse; and, as at that place, the people are exorbitant\r\n   in their demands. Every possible attention has been shown by the\r\n   governor. I paid him a visit of ceremony this morning with the\r\n   other captains of the squadron. He appears a man of the first\r\n   respectability.\r\n\r\n   I thought it proper to mention to him that I had seen Mr.\r\n   Acton's letter, which stated that his Majesty's ships were to be\r\n   received in the ports of this island; and I should do him great\r\n   injustice, did I not observe to you, sir, his earnest endeavours\r\n   that we should be supplied with everything we require on the\r\n   most reasonable terms.\r\n\r\n   A vessel, which left Malta six days ago, reports that the\r\n   inhabitants have revolted against the French, who are driven to\r\n   the greatest stress by the want of provisions. They seem very\r\n   anxious for the appearance of an English squadron off that\r\n   island.\r\n\r\n   I hope to have the squadron completed in water by Wednesday\r\n   next, and to put to sea the same evening. The Spartiate has\r\n   caused us considerable uneasiness, having unfortunately got\r\n   aground by bordering too near the light-house. She was however\r\n   got off without sustaining any damage. All your friends, with\r\n   me, desire their best compliments.\r\n\r\n   I am, my dear Admiral,\r\n   Your ever faithful and obedient servant,\r\n   JAMES SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n   To Sir Horatio Nelson.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Orion, Augusta, 20th September 1798.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR ADMIRAL,\r\n\r\n   I feel great satisfaction in acquainting you that the squadron\r\n   and all the prizes are completed with water, and will be ready\r\n   to proceed to sea at daylight to-morrow morning. The westerly\r\n   winds have prevailed ever since our arrival, and I fear still\r\n   continue in the channel of Malta; but it is of such importance\r\n   to get from this place before easterly winds set in, that not a\r\n   moment has been lost in getting the ships forward, which must be\r\n   evident to you when you consider our great demands for water,\r\n   and that we have only four boats in the squadron to supply the\r\n   ships. We have been abundantly supplied with fresh provisions,\r\n   and each ship takes twelve or fourteen bullocks to sea; but wine\r\n   was not to be had at any reasonable rate. We have found\r\n   difficulty in obtaining cash for the articles purchased on\r\n   account of Government in a place where there scarcely exists any\r\n   trade, and where the inhabitants are extremely poor. The\r\n   governor has offered us every possible assistance; and I must\r\n   entreat you will represent to Mr. Acton the zeal and earnest\r\n   endeavours he has shown to forward the King's service. I have\r\n   the honour to be, &c.\r\n\r\n   JAS. SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n   To Sir Horatio Nelson.\r\n\r\n\"Saturday, 22nd September.--A whole week has elapsed since I closed\r\nthe account of our voyage; having the following day been under the\r\nnecessity, from the state of the weather, to put into Augusta, a port\r\na few leagues from Syracuse. We sailed thence yesterday, after\r\ncompleting the squadron with water. We found abundance of provisions,\r\nand each ship has sailed with a dozen or fourteen oxen, besides sheep,\r\nfowls, &c. Augusta is a more modern town than Syracuse, having been\r\nrebuilt after an earthquake thirty years ago. It has no trade, and the\r\ninhabitants are extremely poor; the ships were visited by them daily,\r\nbut we went to very few parties on shore. A few leagues from Augusta\r\nthere is a considerable town called Catania. I regretted much it was\r\nnot in my power to visit it, as there we might have had many things\r\nthat would have been very acceptable in England.\r\n\r\n\"In passing Syracuse yesterday, several of the principal inhabitants\r\ncame on board; and I was happy in sending a letter to you, enclosed to\r\nAdmiral Nelson at Naples. I hope to be with you as soon as it arrives,\r\nhaving still every expectation of being in England in the month of\r\nOctober. My mind is much more at ease since we have obtained the last\r\nsupplies, as a small quantity of salt provisions, which we can have\r\nfrom the fleet, will enable the ships to proceed for England without\r\nstopping at Gibraltar, or any other place; and if the Orion is not of\r\nthe number, great will be my disappointment.\r\n\r\n\"Thursday, 27th of September.--I have been very much engaged on public\r\nbusiness of great importance the last three days, which, I am sorry to\r\nsay, has not turned out quite equal to my wishes. On Monday I fell in\r\nwith the Marquis de Niza's squadron, which had been ordered off Malta\r\nby Admiral Nelson. On Tuesday a deputation of the principal\r\ninhabitants came on board the Orion, to solicit a supply of arms and\r\nammunition; at the same time informing me that the French garrison\r\nwere in the greatest distress, and that, if the town was summoned,\r\nthey had good grounds to believe they would be induced to surrender. I\r\nwaited on the Marquis de Niza, who readily concurred in sending a flag\r\nof truce with proposals to the French garrison. After three hours'\r\ndeliberation they returned a very concise answer,[19] which although\r\nnot satisfactory at this time, leaves little doubt that they will be\r\ncompelled to surrender very shortly. Before I came away, I supplied\r\nthe inhabitants, from the prizes, with twelve hundred muskets, and a\r\ngreat quantity of ammunition, of which they were in great want. I only\r\nregretted it was not in my power to stay a few days off the island.\r\nThe Guillaume Tell and two frigates are in the harbour, and must fall\r\nwith the garrison. A report prevailed that Le Genereux was lost; these\r\nships form the remaining force that escaped us from the mouth of the\r\nNile.\r\n\r\n   [19] See Appendix.\r\n\r\n\"We are now pursuing our voyage with slow steps; but, as the light\r\nwinds lead us in the fair track, we must not complain. I was glad to\r\nlearn from the Marquis de Niza that the Colossus was seen going to\r\nNaples, with four victuallers and a store-ship. A frigate is now in\r\nsight, joining me, by which I hope to receive good accounts.\r\n\r\n\"Friday morning.--The frigate proved to be the Terpsichore, from the\r\nAdmiral, whom she left ten days ago going to Naples. The Terpsichore\r\nwas going off Malta for intelligence, and to look out for the\r\nColossus, with the victuallers. As I could satisfy the Admiral on both\r\nthose points, I despatched her immediately for Naples. We have now a\r\nfine Siroc wind, attended with all its usual close dampness; but, as\r\nit wafts us down the Mediterranean, we readily put up with its\r\ndisagreeable attendants, without the risk of hanging ourselves. I\r\nintend to part with the Minotaur and Audacious to-day, agreeably to my\r\norders. Fortunately, I exchanged their men from the prizes two days\r\nago, as it would have been attended with danger to do it in the\r\npresent weather. We have taken our final leave of Sicily this morning.\r\n\r\n\"Sunday, 30th Sept. The weather has proved very unfavourable the last\r\nthree days. Le Souverain has sustained some disasters, and causes me\r\ngreat uneasiness. I hope, in another week, to get the distance of\r\nGibraltar, where we may all be better refitted. I cannot be too\r\nthankful for the supplies we obtained at Augusta; the squadron would\r\notherwise have been much distressed for want of water and provisions.\r\nWe are in sight of Sardinia, with every appearance of a favourable\r\nbreeze. To-morrow we enter the ever propitious month. I still hope my\r\nexpectations will be fulfilled; although I own that probability is\r\nagainst their accomplishment.\r\n\r\n\"Thursday, 4th October.--This month began most auspiciously with a\r\nfine breeze of wind, which continued all the following day; but\r\nyesterday morning we experienced a tremendous gale to the northward,\r\nwith a very heavy sea, which still continues: the wind has again\r\nshifted favourably, and I hope this time will carry us through the\r\nStraits; but we have had so many disappointments that we must not\r\ntrust to appearances.\r\n\r\n\"Saturday, 6th.--The winds prove again contrary for us. We have the\r\nSouverain in tow, and in so bad a condition that I almost fear it\r\nwill not be possible to get her as far as Gibraltar. There has been a\r\ngreat deal of blowing weather, with heavy seas, since we left Malta,\r\nand the prizes have suffered considerably from it. I have had an\r\naddition to my stock since I left Augusta, having three fine little\r\nlambs; and I understand more are expected: it is fortunate I was well\r\nprovided, as this increase would have proved ruinous to my table.\r\n\r\n\"Monday, 8th October.--We have had variable winds these last two days,\r\nwhich have brought the squadron a considerable distance. We are at\r\npresent off Algiers, a very unfriendly coast, which I hope soon to\r\nlose sight of with our present breeze. The anchorage off Cadiz having\r\nbroken up about this time last year, I depend on finding Lord St.\r\nVincent at anchor at Gibraltar, or there to find orders to join him at\r\nLisbon, and from thence to proceed to England.\r\n\r\n\"Tuesday, 9th.--I congratulate you on our darling's birth-day; and\r\njoin my prayers to yours that Heaven may bestow on him its choicest\r\nblessings.\r\n\r\n\"We have a continuance of fine wind, which, I trust, will carry us to\r\nGibraltar in two days. I have been treated with the perusal of several\r\nFrench papers, which I intercepted on board a Danish vessel from\r\nMarseilles, bound to Algiers. They are dated so late as the 27th\r\nFructidor, which answers to the 13th September; and I am happy to\r\nsee, by the English news they contain, that things were going on\r\nfavourably. I hope soon to have it under your hand more particularly:\r\nin the mean time it is very satisfactory to receive these news, which\r\nare near three months of later date from England than we before\r\npossessed; your dear letter of the 10th June being the latest I have\r\nseen.\r\n\r\n\"Wednesday, 10th.--I fell in with L'Espoir this morning. She left\r\nGibraltar ten days ago. She has surprised me with the account that the\r\nLeander had not at that time reached Earl St. Vincent; and that the\r\nnews of our victory was only received two days before by the Mutine,\r\nwhich had arrived from Naples. This account has created amongst us\r\ngreat uneasiness for the fate of the Leander. I have despatched\r\nL'Espoir with a letter to Earl St. Vincent, apprising him of the\r\napproach of the prizes, with the ships under my command; and I hope to\r\nreceive his lordship's orders for our proceedings when we appear off\r\nGibraltar.\r\n\r\n\"Saturday, 13th.--The wind has again set against us the last two days,\r\nand continues to exercise our patience. What adds to my uneasiness is,\r\nthe small quantity of provisions in the squadron. We have been at\r\nshort allowance these six weeks; and should it unfortunately continue\r\nto the westward a few days longer, we shall be very badly off. I now\r\nvery reluctantly give up all hope of being in England during this\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\n\"Sunday, 14th.--The wind has again sprung up to the eastward, and I\r\nhope will this time carry us to Gibraltar.\r\n\r\n\"Monday, 15th.--The wind still continues favourable, and to-morrow I\r\nhope to anchor in Gibraltar Bay; and, as an opportunity may offer to\r\nsend you this tedious journal, I hold it in readiness accordingly. It\r\nwill give you some faint idea of the trial our patience has been put\r\nto; and although our progress has not been attended with the same\r\nanxiety as I described in my former journal, when we were in pursuit\r\nof the enemy, still I have not been exempt from great uneasiness on\r\nvarious accounts, particularly from the crippled state of most of the\r\nships, in a navigation some part of which is very hazardous, and where\r\ncontrary winds so invariably prevail. I now hope in a short time to be\r\nreleased from so heavy a charge, and that I shall be permitted to\r\nproceed, as I have been given to expect, _immediately for England_.\r\n\r\n\"Tuesday, 16th.--We have gained sight of Gibraltar this morning; but\r\nwesterly winds and the current prevent our approach to it. I hope,\r\nhowever, to have communication with the Rock to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\"Thursday, 18th.--I received late last evening a very flattering\r\nletter from Earl St. Vincent, in answer to mine of the 10th, which, he\r\nsays, diffused universal joy to the garrison, and the little squadron\r\nwith him: and his lordship has rejoiced my heart by informing me that\r\nso soon as the wounded and sick are landed from the squadron, and the\r\nwants of the ships are supplied, I shall proceed to Lisbon with them.\r\nHe adds that, in his judgment, our action stands foremost in the page\r\nof naval history, having, beyond all dispute, achieved more than was\r\never done before, &c.\r\n\r\n\"We are still struggling against adverse winds, not without hope of\r\ngaining the anchorage to-morrow. I most sincerely wish it, on every\r\naccount; and, although my next rendezvous is not what I exactly\r\nexpected, it always brings me nearer England.\r\n\r\n\"Great is our uneasiness for the fate of the Leander. In the letter\r\nabove alluded to, Lord St. Vincent thinks it probable she may have\r\nbeen dismasted, and have put into one of the islands of the\r\nArchipelago. I own my fears for her are great.\" The following is Lord\r\nSt. Vincent's letter, with Sir James's answer.\r\n\r\n   Gibraltar, 16th October 1798.\r\n\r\n   SIR,\r\n\r\n   Your letter of the 10th instant, received yesterday, has\r\n   diffused universal joy through the garrison and little squadron\r\n   now here. I highly applaud and admire the measures taken by you\r\n   and Rear-admiral the Marquis de Niza to induce the French to\r\n   surrender their stronghold in Malta; and the supply of arms and\r\n   ammunition you furnished the islanders with was very judicious.\r\n   Two very respectable Moorish merchants, natives of the eastern\r\n   coast of Barbary, who arrived at Gibraltar from Genoa\r\n   yesterday, report that advices had been received at the latter\r\n   place before they left it, that the Maltese had succeeded, and\r\n   put the French garrison to the sword. I have been so long\r\n   accustomed to the fallacy of _pratique_ reports, that I do not\r\n   give entire credit to this.\r\n\r\n   Of the Leander we know nothing; and I am rather inclined to\r\n   believe that the story Sir Horatio Nelson learned from a Candia\r\n   boat, is true; and that she has either been dismasted in the\r\n   action, or so crippled as to be obliged to take refuge in one of\r\n   the islands of the Archipelago. I never despair, and I have\r\n   great confidence that she will yet turn up.\r\n\r\n   The account you give from Captain Retallick, of the near\r\n   approach to Naples of the Colossus and her precious charge,--for\r\n   the Alliance is full of naval stores, with all the top-masts and\r\n   top-sail yards we had, and the four victuallers loaded with new\r\n   provisions of every species except bread,--is a communication of\r\n   the utmost consequence.\r\n\r\n   It is my anxious wish that the six prize ships of war should be\r\n   safe moored in the Tagus as soon as possible; and my intention\r\n   that the Orion, Defence, and Theseus shall accompany them: the\r\n   Bellerophon and Majestic to enter Gibraltar Mole in order to be\r\n   remasted, for all the lower masts are there; and their men,\r\n   after assisting in the navigation of the prizes to Lisbon, may\r\n   return hither in the Santa Dorothea.\r\n\r\n   I am fitting out an expedition of great importance,--I believe,\r\n   _entre nous_, against Monte Video, or Lima,--which swallows up\r\n   all the transports and frigates I have, or I would send you some\r\n   salt provisions and wine. Should the Levanters fail you, by\r\n   working close to the Barbary shore you will soon reach Tetuan\r\n   Bay, and find no difficulty in working round Europa with a\r\n   flood-tide.\r\n\r\n   I request you will convey to your brave companions in arms,\r\n   that, in my judgment, they stand foremost in the page of naval\r\n   history; having, beyond all dispute, achieved more than was ever\r\n   done before, and, under the critical circumstances of the times,\r\n   have certainly rendered the greatest benefit to the human race\r\n   at large, and to their King and country in particular, that ever\r\n   was performed.\r\n\r\n   I have the honour to be, with great esteem and regard,\r\n   Sir,\r\n   Your most obedient, humble servant,\r\n   ST. VINCENT.\r\n\r\n   To Sir James Saumarez.\r\n\r\n   P.S. Doctor Harness has prepared the naval hospital for the\r\n   reception of the wounded and sick of your squadron in the best\r\n   manner our means will admit; the wards have been whitewashed,\r\n   and every exertion made to purify them. The moment the invalids\r\n   are landed, and the wants of the ships that go to Lisbon\r\n   supplied, you shall proceed thither with them.\r\n   ST. VINCENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Orion, off Gibraltar, 18th Oct. 1798.\r\n\r\n   MY LORD,\r\n\r\n   I received late last evening the honour of your letter by\r\n   L'Espoir, and shall not fail to communicate to the squadron the\r\n   very handsome terms in which your lordship is pleased to express\r\n   yourself of the action of the Nile. I am particularly happy the\r\n   measures taken off Malta meet with your lordship's approbation;\r\n   but I fear the account from Genoa is premature respecting the\r\n   French garrison, as there has scarcely been time since we left\r\n   the island, the 26th Sept. for the news to reach Genoa, and\r\n   arrive at Gibraltar, if such an event had taken place.\r\n\r\n   Fearing that, with the ship I have in tow, it will not be\r\n   possible to reach Rozia Bay till a late hour, I send an officer\r\n   on shore with the despatches for your lordship, and the letters\r\n   for the garrison.\r\n\r\n   I have the honour to be, my lord,\r\n   Your lordship's most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n   JAMES SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n   To the Right Hon. Earl St. Vincent.\r\n\r\nThe squadron arrived at Gibraltar on the evening of the 18th, amidst\r\nthe universal and unbounded acclamations of the assembled population.\r\n\r\n\"Sunday, 21st Oct.--Last Thursday, my dear love, we all anchored in\r\nsafety in this bay, and met with a reception we want words to express\r\nfrom the governor, admiral, officers, soldiers, seamen, and\r\ninhabitants. We can never do justice to the warmth of their applause,\r\nand the praises they all bestowed on our squadron.\r\n\r\n\"A ball was given last night by the governor, in honour of our\r\nvictory; and we have a round of dinner invitations from the heads of\r\nthe garrison. I am, however, happy to tell you that to-morrow I expect\r\nto put to sea for Lisbon, with the Theseus and prizes, which I am to\r\nleave in safety in the Tagus, and then proceed to England. I am to\r\ngive a passage to the Duc d'Havre and his suite: he is a nobleman of\r\ndistinction, who has resided some time in Spain, but has been expelled\r\nfrom that country with other _emigres_. I had an opportunity of\r\nsending you, by a cutter for Lagos, a short letter, with the above\r\npleasing accounts, which I am persuaded will yield no less happiness\r\nto you than it has to me.\"\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned the honours, the titles, the decorations,\r\nand the favours conferred on the victorious Nelson, as also the\r\npraises he had himself bestowed on some of the captains of the fleet;\r\nbut we cannot refrain from reverting to the extraordinary circumstance\r\nthat the second in command in that battle, which both Earl St. Vincent\r\nand Mr. Pitt declared \"stands foremost in the page of naval history,\"\r\nand which (as before stated), was most highly extolled, had not that\r\nmark of distinction conferred upon him, which is usually granted on\r\nsuch occasions. In common, indeed, with the other captains, he\r\nreceived a gold medal; being only the second given to him, although he\r\ncommanded a ship of the line in four great general actions, and served\r\nin two others.[20] We mention this, because Sir James was not aware of\r\nthe extent of this neglect until many years after, when, meeting with\r\nClarke and Mac Arthur's Life of Nelson, he discovered that Nelson's\r\nletters had influenced the Admiralty to regard him as having held no\r\nhigher station in the action than any other captain in the squadron,\r\nand represented Sir Thomas Troubridge, who unfortunately had no part\r\nin the battle, as equally entitled to reward as himself: therefore he\r\nfelt this deviation from the common usage less severely at the time\r\nthan he would otherwise have done.\r\n\r\n   [20] The actions of Sullivan's Island, and the Dogger Bank.\r\n\r\nWe admit that it would be difficult to point out a situation of\r\nextraordinary hardship more peculiarly calculated, than that of\r\nTroubridge, to excite the feelings of sympathy expressed so strongly\r\nby Nelson.\r\n\r\nBut what would have been the situation,--what would have been the\r\nfeelings of Sir James Saumarez, had he been sent away to make room for\r\nSir Thomas Troubridge? We leave the reader to judge. Suffice it to\r\nsay, that as soon as the Admiral had ascertained the real force of the\r\nenemy, he found the Orion could not be spared, by which fortunate\r\ncircumstance Sir James was saved a mortification which would have\r\nweighed on his heart the remainder of his days.\r\n\r\nEvery admiral, captain, and officer, with whom we have conversed on\r\nthe subject, has been decidedly of opinion that the name of Saumarez\r\nought to have been honourably mentioned; and that, as second in\r\ncommand, some mark of distinction should have been conferred upon him.\r\nWe dwell on this subject particularly, because we know, that when a\r\nbrave and meritorious officer does not obtain the reward due to his\r\nmerit, it is extremely injurious to the service, as it damps that\r\nardour after fame, and weakens that emulation, which lead to valour\r\nand enterprise. May every succeeding Nelson regard, and be able to\r\nlook up to, that motto which was conferred on the hero of the\r\nNile,--_Palmam qui meruit, ferat!_\r\n\r\nOn Sir James's arrival at Gibraltar he received the following letters\r\nfrom Sir Horatio Nelson, approving of his proceedings:--\r\n\r\n   Vanguard, Naples, 29th Sept. 1798.\r\n\r\n   SIR,\r\n\r\n   I have received your letter of the 17th from Augusta, as well as\r\n   your despatch of the 27th, by Captain Gage.\r\n\r\n   I very much approve of your putting into Augusta to get water,\r\n   and very highly so of your officer-like behaviour and conduct\r\n   relative to Malta, as also of your supplying the Maltese with\r\n   arms and ammunition.\r\n\r\n   I am, sir,\r\n   Your most obedient servant,\r\n   HORATIO NELSON.\r\n\r\n   To Sir James Saumarez.\r\n\r\n\r\n   September 29th, 1798.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR SIR JAMES,\r\n\r\n   Captain Gage is just arrived with your letters and papers\r\n   relative to Malta. I can say with truth there is no action of\r\n   your life, as far as relates to me, but what must be entirely to\r\n   my approbation: your summons to Malta is highly proper; and you\r\n   have done as I wished in sending the arms, &c. The wind here is\r\n   strong at S.E. I hope you have it, and that it will carry you\r\n   through the Straits. This is a sad place for refitting, the\r\n   swell sets in so heavy; never again do we come to Naples:\r\n   besides the rest, we are killed with kindness. Wishing you, my\r\n   dear Sir James, every felicity in this world, believe me ever,\r\n\r\n   Your obliged and affectionate,\r\n   HORATIO NELSON.\r\n\r\n   Sir James Saumarez.\r\n\r\nAt Gibraltar Sir James also received a letter from his gallant friend\r\nand brother-in-arms, Captain Ball, which gives so vivid a description\r\nof some of the events of this most eventful period of the war, that we\r\nare persuaded the reader will thank us for inserting it.\r\n\r\n   Alexander, at sea, 11th Oct. 1798.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR SIR JAMES,\r\n\r\n   I have the satisfaction of sending you, by the Colossus, a case\r\n   containing six fan-mounts, two boxes of perfumery, four large\r\n   and two small of Naples soap, amounting to eighteen Spanish\r\n   dollars and a half. I hope to collect from Sicily some\r\n   ornamental figures for a table, which I will forward to you, by\r\n   the first safe conveyance, with some Neapolitan shawls. I shall\r\n   not draw upon your agent, as I expect, when I return to Naples,\r\n   to receive nearly forty pounds as your share of the cotton and\r\n   articles taken out of the Spanish polacre we captured. Pray let\r\n   me know to whom I shall remit the balance. I sincerely hope that\r\n   you had a good passage down, and have not suffered from the\r\n   fatigue and anxiety you must have experienced. I make no doubt\r\n   but you will have the pleasure of convoying the ships to\r\n   England, where you will be amply recompensed by a joyful meeting\r\n   with Lady Saumarez and your family. When you get your second\r\n   medal, beware of the ladies, if they hear such a story of you as\r\n   of our friend Collingwood. I shall feel very much flattered\r\n   whenever you will favour me with a line; and you may be assured\r\n   that I shall never lose an occasion of testifying to you my\r\n   great esteem, and how very much I value your friendship. I\r\n   enclose herewith a translation of Admiral Blanquet's account of\r\n   the battle of the Nile, with his plans, which he is to present\r\n   to the French Minister of the Marine. One of my officers copied\r\n   them unknown to him, but his aide-de-camp allowed everybody to\r\n   read them.\r\n\r\n   It would be difficult to describe to you the very flattering\r\n   reception we met with at Naples. Our gallant Admiral was hailed\r\n   as the saviour of Italy. He daily receives from all parts\r\n   congratulatory addresses and verses, celebrating his fame. The\r\n   King visited him before he anchored, and he gave him and all the\r\n   captains a very elegant dinner on board one of his ships of the\r\n   line. We dined on the poop; the party very select, consisting of\r\n   the hereditary Prince and one of his brothers, the Minister of\r\n   Marine, three of the Lords in waiting, Sir William and Lady\r\n   Hamilton, and the captain of the Neapolitan ship. After dinner,\r\n   the King gave as a toast, \"Sir Horatio Nelson and the brave\r\n   English nation,\" with a salute from his lower deck guns. Sir\r\n   William Hamilton gave a fete that cost more than a thousand\r\n   pounds. It was much admired for its taste and magnificence.\r\n   There was nothing to be seen or heard of but \"Viva Nelson!\" The\r\n   English nation never stood so high in the estimation of the\r\n   Italians as at this present moment: and I believe the French\r\n   were never so universally execrated and despised as they now\r\n   are. The Emperor and King of Naples will make an effort to drive\r\n   them out of Italy. General Mack was daily expected at Naples to\r\n   arrange the plans.\r\n\r\n   We have to regret the capture of the Leander by the Genereux.\r\n   She is carried into Corfu. Of course all our letters by her are\r\n   destroyed, and our friends will suffer much anxiety until the\r\n   arrival of Capel, who could not get there before the 20th of\r\n   last month. The grand Seignior declared war against the French\r\n   the 1st of last month. He did not receive the Admiral's official\r\n   account of the action until the 6th ult. He has ordered a\r\n   costly diamond to be presented to him for the important victory.\r\n\r\n   Buonaparte's career is nearly finished. He will soon be\r\n   surrounded by sixty thousand men. One of his colonels, whom\r\n   Foley took very lately, says that the whole army will soon\r\n   perish. He sent to Alexandria for all the troops in garrison to\r\n   join him without loss of time, which they refused doing. The\r\n   seamen marched to retrieve their character, but I do not think\r\n   many will return to tell of their exploits. A Turkish fleet is\r\n   gone for Alexandria. Our Envoy at Constantinople, Sir Sidney\r\n   Smith's brother, has gained great credit by his ability and\r\n   judicious conduct. I had great satisfaction in reading some of\r\n   his correspondence. We expect very soon to be in possession of\r\n   Malta, Corfu, Zante, and Cerigo. I shall then hope to go to\r\n   England, Sir H. Nelson having given me reason to expect the\r\n   pleasure of carrying home Sir William and Lady Hamilton.\r\n\r\n   I am now in company with the Colossus, going off Malta, which we\r\n   are in sight of. Captain Murray talks of staying to ascertain\r\n   the state of the island. He is then to proceed to join Lord St.\r\n   Vincent. He has this moment made the signal for Gibraltar; I\r\n   must therefore refer you to him for the state of Malta. The\r\n   French must surrender in a few days. Their ships mean to slip\r\n   out and trust to their sailing. Believe me,\r\n\r\n   With true esteem and regard,\r\n   My dear Sir James, very sincerely yours,\r\n   ALEX. M. BALL.\r\n\r\n   Sir James Saumarez, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nTo return to Sir James's journal:\r\n\r\n\"19th October.--Your valued letters of the 21st July and 29th August\r\nI received the morning of my arrival, and they gave me real comfort\r\nafter so long a privation. I now trust that, in a few weeks, we shall\r\nbe re-united, no more to part! It is my firm intention to remain, for\r\nsome time at least, entirely abstracted from active service. If I can\r\ndo so, and retain the command of the ship, well and good; if not, I\r\nshall apply to be superseded.\r\n\r\n\"An expedition under Sir John Duckworth is now sailing from this bay;\r\nvarious are the conjectures on its destination. I need not tell you,\r\nafter what I have noticed respecting the Earl, that we are on a very\r\ngood footing. Indeed, the solicitous attention he shows to me almost\r\noverwhelms me, as I wish to keep clear of laying myself under\r\nobligation, except as far as concerns the promotion of my officers.\r\n\r\n\"24th October, Orion, off Cadiz.--Yesterday I got clear of Gibraltar\r\nBay with the Theseus and five of the prizes, it having been decided,\r\nthe morning before we sailed, to leave the Souverain for a hulk at\r\nGibraltar, which I had strongly recommended before.\r\n\r\n\"I was fortunate in the arrival of the Transfer brig, in ten days from\r\nNaples, a few hours previous to our sailing. She brought the sad news\r\nof the capture of the Leander, with the despatches; but having long\r\nbefore given her over for lost, and being apprehensive for the safety\r\nof all on board, the account rather gave me satisfaction, especially\r\nas she is said to have well supported the fame of the Nile squadron,\r\nthough the details of the action are not known.\r\n\r\n\"Earl St. Vincent afforded me the perusal of several interesting\r\nletters that came by the Transfer from Naples, particularly from the\r\nenvoy and our gallant Admiral: he was on the point of sailing for\r\nMalta, which, there is scarcely a doubt, is by this time, entirely in\r\npossession of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\n\"We are going on with a fine breeze for Lisbon, which I hope to reach\r\nbefore Saturday. This morning I gained sight of our squadron off\r\nCadiz; and, although within a few miles of one of the ships, (the\r\nHector,) they had not the curiosity to join us, and I was unwilling to\r\nbe delayed by going to them, although I should have been happy to have\r\nhad communication with some of the ships. I hope my stay at Lisbon\r\nwill be but short; as, after I embark the Duc d'Havre, and have seen\r\nthe prizes taken care of, I proceed immediately for Portsmouth. Judge\r\nthen of my feelings. My only regret is, being unable to impart them to\r\nyou!\r\n\r\n\"Thursday.--Early this morning I fell in with the Barfleur and\r\nNorthumberland. Although not without great difficulty, I persevered in\r\nmy endeavours to join them; but, to my great concern, I found no\r\nletters for me on board either ship. Captain Dacres tells me he wrote\r\nto Ryde, thinking you were there, but in vain. Lady Parker, however,\r\nassured him that she had a letter from you very lately.\r\n\r\n\"I was glad to hear Captain Capel had reached England with the\r\naccounts of our action, the news of which were received at Portsmouth\r\nthe day before the Barfleur sailed.\r\n\r\n\"Fortune has, as usual, proved propitious this month. What think you\r\nof two vessels, with valuable cargoes from Genoa, which promise to\r\ngive, at the most moderate computation, at least L10,000 between\r\nCaptain Miller and myself![21] The Theseus joined me with one\r\nyesterday noon, and we brought the other to, some time after; both\r\nunder Greek colours, but unquestionably laden with the property of\r\nGenoese merchants. More are on their way, which we expect to fall in\r\nwith. But indeed, my dearest love, we require not riches to add to our\r\nhappiness. Let us but have peace and tranquillity, and we have enough\r\nfor every earthly enjoyment whilst it pleases Heaven to bless us with\r\ngood health. Alas, poor Lady W.! how sensibly I feel for the\r\nmisfortune that has deprived her excellent husband of all prospect of\r\never again enjoying comfort in this life. She was, indeed, all you\r\nhave said of her.\r\n\r\n   [21] This was never realised.\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow I depend on arriving at Lisbon, with the hope of being\r\ndetained a few days only, and where I rely on being cheered with\r\nletters from you. _A propos_: Miss R. is there, and will not be sorry\r\nto hear the Leander is at last heard of, although in possession of the\r\nenemy. She is going to England with General and Mrs. Trigge.\r\n\r\n\"27th October.--I had hoped before the arrival of this _blessed_ day\r\nto acquaint you with our being safe in the Tagus; but the light winds\r\nprevented our getting round Cape St. Vincent before yesterday evening,\r\nand it now blows so strong from the westward that there is no\r\npossibility of getting over the bar. To-morrow, I trust, we shall be\r\nmore fortunate; or, what would prove still better, that it will blow\r\nso strong as to compel me to bear up for the Channel, which I\r\ncertainly would do in case of a south-west gale.\r\n\r\n\"Sunday, two o'clock.--I now congratulate you on our safe arrival in\r\nthe Tagus, in the midst of very boisterous weather; but, thanks to\r\nDivine Providence! without an accident to any of the ships; I have but\r\nonce more to weigh anchor, and then I trust in its mercy to bring me\r\nto the haven where I would be, and to find all my precious treasures\r\nin complete possession of health and happiness.\r\n\r\n\"A packet arrived this morning with Commissioner Coffin. The only\r\nletter I have been so fortunate as to receive is one from Mr. Le M.\r\ndated the day Captain Capel arrived. What would I not give for one of\r\nas late date from you! Another is soon expected, this packet having\r\nhad nearly three weeks' passage.\"\r\n\r\nThe extract of the following letter from Sir James to the\r\ncommander-in-chief continues this narrative:\r\n\r\n   Orion, Tagus, 1st November, 1798.\r\n\r\n   MY LORD,\r\n\r\n   I have the honour to acquaint your lordship of the safe arrival\r\n   in the Tagus of this ship and the Theseus, with five of the\r\n   prize-ships lately taken in his Majesty's service.\r\n\r\n   His grace the Duc d'Havre embarks on board this ship on Monday\r\n   next; and the Marquis de Mortemart having solicited a passage to\r\n   England, I have consented to receive him on condition of his\r\n   being considered in the suite of the duke. Captain Tyler also\r\n   takes his passage in the Orion. I should have been happy to have\r\n   made the like offer to General Trigge, but it was not possible\r\n   to accommodate him and the ladies of his family without\r\n   considerable inconvenience to the Duc d'Havre. His grace is a\r\n   nobleman of the first distinction and consideration, and he\r\n   expresses himself very sensible of your lordship's attention in\r\n   providing for him so good a conveyance.\r\n\r\n   I beg to offer my most sincere and fervent wishes for health and\r\n   every happiness to attend your lordship; and, with my unfeigned\r\n   thanks for all your lordship's favour,\r\n\r\n   I remain, &c.\r\n\r\nSir James, having now fulfilled the anxious charge entrusted to him,\r\nand, with great professional skill and unremitting vigilance, brought\r\nthe prizes in safety to Lisbon, is at length setting sail for England:\r\nand who will not share the feelings of the husband and the father, on\r\napproaching his home after so long an absence! The following extracts\r\nfrom his letters will convey some impression of what those feelings\r\nwere.\r\n\r\n   Lisbon, Nov. 3rd, 1798.\r\n\r\n   I am now rejoicing in the hope of being in England nearly as\r\n   soon as this letter can reach you. I propose to sail from this\r\n   place the beginning of next week, and I trust my arrival will\r\n   shortly follow. Let me find a letter from you at Portsmouth. I\r\n   depend on your being ready to set off as soon as you hear the\r\n   Orion is there. The post will arrive sufficiently early to allow\r\n   of your leaving Bath the same day. I may possibly be able to\r\n   meet you on the road, as I shall have had time to despatch\r\n   Monsieur le Duc d'Havre (who is a very polite Frenchman) and to\r\n   make arrangements against our return. I think it right to\r\n   mention that unless the wind admits the ships getting over the\r\n   Bar of Lisbon, I may be detained. But I hope for a quick\r\n   passage.\r\n\r\n\"Sunday, November 25th, Spithead.--I wrote to you, this morning, from\r\nSt. Helens. The happy moment is at length arrived when I can despatch\r\na letter from Spithead. Yours of yesterday is in my hand. To-morrow\r\nyou will be setting off; but I fear the service will prevent our\r\nmeeting till the day after.\r\n\r\n\"I have despatched Dumaresq to Newport for our dear boy; and I depend\r\non seeing him to-night. _Le Duc est empresse de le voir._ I hope to\r\nget the party on shore, _de bonne heure_, to-morrow: but we are still\r\nin quarantine whilst I am making these arrangements.\r\n\r\n\"Tuesday morning.--Great is my disappointment at being kept thus long\r\nin quarantine: it is a cruel _contre temps_, and the more so from its\r\nbeing unforeseen. What adds to my disappointment is, that I am at a\r\nloss to know if our _pratique_ has been received by this day's post,\r\nthe weather having prevented all communication with the shore. It will\r\nrejoice you to learn that our beloved boy has been with me since ten,\r\nyesterday morning, and that I find him all you have described. I\r\nexpect to hear every moment of your arrival at the Fountain. Mr.\r\nMaxwell writes there is no doubt of our being released to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\"One o'clock.--If our _pratique_ is not received by this post, request\r\nSir Peter to set the telegraph at work, now that the weather has\r\ncleared up. 8 P.M. Your letter has this instant reached me. The\r\ntidings of your arrival have relieved my mind from great inquietude.\r\nThe messenger has orders to wait your commands until after the post\r\nhour to-morrow; and if we are not then admitted to the privileges of\r\n_Christian charity_ after our _Egyptian bondage_, we must _endeavour_\r\nto submit to our fate. James is by my side, and glows with\r\nthankfulness at being so soon likely to embrace his beloved mamma. He\r\nhas indeed been a real comfort to me under this sad contrariety of\r\nevents. I have placed Monsieur Le Duc, and the rest of the party, at\r\ncards, to send these lines in time _pour ton reveil demain. Encore\r\nadieu, ma tres chere_! Write every hour of the day, and send your\r\nletters to Mr. Maxwell.\r\n\r\n\"Wednesday morning.--Grieved as I am to be a prisoner still another\r\nday, there is consolation in the _certainty_ of our being released\r\nto-morrow. Ardently as I aspire for the moment of our meeting, I must\r\ndelay going on shore until after the performance of divine service in\r\nthis ship:[22] and I know this arrangement will have your full\r\nconcurrence. Your note is just received: how well have you anticipated\r\nmy thoughts, and met my wishes even before they were expressed. Please\r\nGod, to-morrow we shall be compensated for a separation of two long\r\nyears; and on a day in which none can have greater mercies to\r\ncommemorate than ourselves.\r\n\r\n   [22] November 29th, the day appointed for a general thanksgiving\r\n   for the great naval victories.\r\n\r\n\"Wednesday evening.--I have just ascertained that the Duke and the\r\nMarquis do not proceed to town before Friday; therefore expect to\r\nreceive them at dinner, and desire Mrs. Fielding to prepare for\r\neighteen or twenty guests.\"\r\n\r\nSir James remained at Portsmouth, until the 15th December, when he\r\nsailed for Plymouth, at which place he arrived on the 22nd: and on\r\nthe 6th of January 1799 the Orion was paid off, when Sir James went to\r\nBath, where he was once more free and happy in the bosom of his\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n1800.\r\n\r\n   Sir James writes to Earl Spencer.--Is appointed to the Caesar, of\r\n   84 guns.--Joins the Channel fleet.--The Brest fleet having\r\n   escaped, proceeds to the Mediterranean.--English fleet at Bantry\r\n   Bay.--Return of the French fleet.--Caesar at Lisbon.--Sir James\r\n   returns to Spithead.--Rejoins the Channel fleet.--Earl St.\r\n   Vincent takes the command.--Appoints Sir James to command the\r\n   advanced squadron.--Black Rocks.--Earl St. Vincent's letter of\r\n   approbation.--Douvernenez Bay.--Various letters.--Complete\r\n   success of the blockade--Enemy's fleet laid up Sir James returns\r\n   to Spithead.--Conclusion of 1800.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir James had cherished the hope that he was to be permitted to enjoy\r\nthe blessings of domestic life, at least for a few months; but even in\r\nthe most perfect state of happiness which can be well imagined, he\r\nalways held his duty to his King and country, (next to the duty he\r\nowed to his Creator,) to be paramount to every other consideration;\r\nand, feeling himself bound, after a short period of relaxation, to\r\noffer his services, he wrote the following letter:\r\n\r\n   Bath, 15th January 1799.\r\n\r\n   MY LORD,\r\n\r\n   As you were pleased to intimate your intention of being at Bath\r\n   when I last had the honour of seeing you, I delayed writing\r\n   until this time. I am extremely happy to find that Lady\r\n   Spencer's improved state of health has rendered the journey\r\n   unnecessary.\r\n\r\n   Two days after my arrival I received a letter from Admiral\r\n   Young, proposing to me (in the absence of your lordship) a large\r\n   seventy-four, which I declined accepting, as you had done me the\r\n   honour to offer me the Caesar, on a certain expected event taking\r\n   place. I hope you will forgive me for entreating that as many of\r\n   the Orion's ship's company may be reserved for me as the service\r\n   will admit. Having experienced their uniform good conduct for so\r\n   many years, I am most solicitous to have them with me in another\r\n   ship.\r\n\r\n   I have the honour to be,\r\n   With the highest respect,\r\n   Your lordship's most obedient and humble servant,\r\n   JAMES SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n   To the Right Honourable Earl Spencer, &c. &c. &c.\r\n\r\nTo the above, Sir James received the following answer:\r\n\r\n   Admiralty, 18th January 1799.\r\n\r\n   DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n   Lady Spencer's journey to Bath is only deferred, I fear; as it\r\n   will probably be necessary for her to go there soon.\r\n\r\n   The proposal made to you by Admiral Young was only intended as a\r\n   temporary measure, in case you had no objection to be employed\r\n   in the interval before you could have a permanent appointment.\r\n   Whenever the period shall come at which I can propose such an\r\n   appointment to you, I shall avail myself of it with pleasure.\r\n   With respect to reserving your ship's company, that practice is\r\n   attended with so much inconvenience to the public service, that\r\n   it has of late been necessarily discontinued. Although there is\r\n   no one in whose favour I should be more disposed to relax than\r\n   to you, I fear it will be impossible for me to do so in this\r\n   particular. I am, dear sir,\r\n\r\n   Your very obedient and humble servant,\r\n   SPENCER.\r\n\r\n   To Sir James Saumarez, &c. &c. &c.\r\n\r\nThe 14th of February, being the anniversary of the glorious victory\r\nobtained over the Spanish fleet, was selected for a promotion of\r\nflag-officers; and on this occasion his Majesty was pleased to confer\r\non Sir James Saumarez one of the colonelcies of Marines as a reward\r\nfor his many and meritorious services. Earl Spencer availed himself of\r\nthe opportunity to appoint him to the Caesar, of 84 guns, one of the\r\nfinest, but hitherto most unfortunate, ships in the British navy. Sir\r\nJames hoisted his pendant on the 26th of February, and had the\r\nsatisfaction to have several of his officers and crew removed from the\r\nOrion to the Caesar, in Hamoaze, where her fitting out went on with\r\nconsiderable rapidity. On the 19th of March she proceeded to Cawsand\r\nBay, where, on the 30th, she rode out a heavy gale of wind from the\r\nS.E.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, in company with the Magnificent and Impetueux,\r\nshe sailed for the Channel fleet, commanded by Admiral Berkeley, which\r\nshe joined off Brest the 3rd April. On the 16th, Lord Bridport arrived\r\nfrom Portsmouth with five sail more, increasing the fleet to fifteen\r\nsail of the line. Another heavy gale was experienced on the 20th, but\r\nno damage was sustained.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th, looking into Brest Harbour, they were surprised to see\r\nthe French fleet, consisting of twenty-five sail, partly in Camaret\r\nBay, and under way in Brest Water. The fleet stood off Ushant; the\r\nwind came to the S.E. with hazy weather, and on the same night they\r\nescaped.\r\n\r\nSir James writes:--\r\n\r\n\"April 27th.--Yesterday at noon, it blowing very strong from the\r\nnorthward, with foggy weather, the signal was made that the enemy was\r\nunder sail. A general chase soon followed; but, I am sorry to say,\r\nthey eluded our pursuit under cover of the thick weather, keeping\r\nclose to their shore, by the passage du Raz. The cruise has now taken\r\nquite a different turn to what I expected; and it gives me great\r\nspirits to find we are likely to render to our country some service.\r\n\r\n\"1st of May.--My fervent vows were very early offered, my best love,\r\nfor Heaven's choicest blessings to attend you, with many, many returns\r\nof your natal day. The fatted calf was intended to have been killed\r\nfor the fete; but the bustle caused by the French fleet occasioned its\r\nbeing neglected. Your health, however, will be drunk in a bumper of my\r\nbest wine. I have a letter from the Duc d'Havre, dated Edinburgh,\r\nwhere he was on a visit to Monsieur.[23] He was going to embark for\r\nthe continent. _Mille complimens de sa part pour miladi_, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n   [23] Afterwards Louis XVIII.\r\n\r\n\"May 5th.--We have had, the last three days, a strong S.E. gale,\r\nwhich has brought us off Ireland. I hope to-morrow we shall fall in\r\nwith ships from Plymouth, and that I shall have the satisfaction of\r\nreceiving letters from you,--the greatest I can possibly enjoy at this\r\ntime, except that of beating the French fleet.\r\n\r\n\"May 8th.--Off Cape Clear.--Captain Durham hailed me: he says the\r\nFrench fleet were seen a week ago, steering to the southward. These\r\nare trying times for those who feel as we do the importance of events,\r\nwhich involve and may decide the fate of nations.\r\n\r\n\"May 17th.--Sir Alan Gardner has joined us this morning with a\r\nreinforcement. We are still without any certain intelligence of the\r\nenemy; a few days must determine. I only wish we could soon, very soon\r\nmeet them, to put a stop to our perplexity and impatience.\r\n\r\n\"Friday evening, 24th May.--We are just anchored in Bantry Bay. I fear\r\nmy conjectures of the enemy being gone to Portugal, or the\r\nMediterranean, and not being destined for this country, are too surely\r\nfounded.\r\n\r\n\"I have this instant received your letter of the 4th, by which,\r\nthough, as yet, very hastily perused, I learn you are at Teignmouth. I\r\nam sorry to see that you have already taken alarm at the reports which\r\nare circulated respecting us: follow the example of Lady Howe, who\r\nneither reads newspapers, nor listens to rumours. I know not who are\r\nmost to blame, those who invent them, or you who believe them.\r\n\r\n\"26th.--We continue without any certain accounts respecting the\r\ndestination of the French armament. Admiral Collingwood arrived this\r\nmorning, and hoists his flag in the Triumph. He will take a strong\r\ndetachment with him for the Mediterranean. It is not yet known what\r\nships are to go: but I have been on board Lord Bridport; and I do not\r\nhear the Caesar is to be one of them; which, I suppose, will _please_\r\nyou: _in other respects_, there is no doubt that the Mediterranean\r\nstation is far preferable to the Channel service. Your wish that we\r\nshould carry away a mast was nearly gratified, the Achille and the\r\nCaesar having been on board each other in coming into this bay; the\r\nprincipal damage was, however, sustained by the former;\r\nnotwithstanding which, she will not be obliged to return into port;\r\ntherefore, form no such wishes, but show yourself a true patriot, and\r\nlet the good of the country be the principal wish of your heart. The\r\nescape of the French fleet, was, I dare say, consonant to these\r\nfeminine feelings, and see what a dilemma it has thrown us into.\r\n\r\n\"31st May.--Off Cape Clear.--I see Lord Bridport very frequently, who\r\nalways inquires most kindly after you. His lordship, it may be\r\nbelieved, is not very well satisfied with the present state of\r\naffairs. We must hope that future good will result from apparent evil;\r\nbut it must ever be regretted that the French fleet escaped from\r\nBrest, without being brought to action. I think it probable Sir Alan\r\nGardner will have the command of a strong detachment, and proceed off\r\nCape Finisterre; but what ships are to be attached to him will not be\r\nknown until the separation takes place. Should the French fleet be\r\ngone up the Mediterranean, they will proceed on that station; in which\r\ncase I hope the Caesar will be one of Sir Alan's squadron. I am well\r\nprovided for a long cruise. When I shall hear from you, Heaven alone\r\nknows! but I am endued with patience, after all our trials. The\r\n_eloge_ of Mr. Morgan, on our dear boy, is a great satisfaction to me,\r\nand no less so at knowing him to be where his morals will be attended\r\nto, equally with the other branches of his education.\r\n\r\n\"June 9th.--My last will have led you to expect my being detached with\r\nSir A. Gardner. We separated from Lord Bridport, Saturday, with\r\nsixteen sail of the line; and we are already the distance of Lisbon,\r\nwith a fine breeze, steering for the Mediterranean. I almost fear we\r\nshall be too late, notwithstanding the expedition we are using. I fell\r\nin with a Dane, from whom I learned the French fleet had passed the\r\nStraits, and Lord St. Vincent after them.\r\n\r\n\"Sunday 10th.--In going down with the information to the Admiral, we\r\nhad the misfortune to carry away our fore-top-mast. I was not a little\r\nsurprised to find Sir Alan with only the Magnificent and Russell, Sir\r\nCharles Cotton having been detached to the Mediterranean; thus I fear\r\nwe shall be deprived sharing in the victory we hoped to obtain over\r\nthe enemy's fleet. Our small squadron is returning towards Lisbon,\r\ninstead of gaining the medals we made sure of.\r\n\r\n\"14th.--Off Lisbon. We are anxiously waiting here for intelligence.\r\nThe Admiral surprised me with the information that the object of our\r\ncoming to Lisbon was to take away our prizes. He has ordered me in to\r\naccelerate their joining him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Alexander Ball, in a letter to Sir James, dated off Malta, 27th\r\nApril 1799, writes: \"Be assured that your appointment to the Marines\r\nand the command of the Caesar, which are given to you as a mark of the\r\nhigh estimation in which you are regarded by the Admiralty and the\r\npublic, has given me more joy than I should have received from the\r\nappointment of any other person on the list, because I have had the\r\nsatisfaction of witnessing your bravery, zeal, and ardour in the\r\nservice. I am much pleased with your plan of the sword.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commander-in-chief, supposing the destination of the French\r\nexpedition to be Ireland, proceeded at once to Bantry Bay, where the\r\nfleet remained until the end of May; while the enemy passed the\r\nStraits of Gibraltar unmolested, having been on that occasion favoured\r\nby a gale of wind, which prevented the fleet under Lord Keith (though\r\ncertainly very inferior) from bringing them to action. The French and\r\nSpanish fleets returned to Brest, unobserved, on the 21st of June.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time a part of Lord Bridport's fleet, in which was the\r\nCaesar, proceeded under command of Sir Alan Gardner to the Tagus, which\r\nit left on the 18th; and, cruising back, returned to Cawsand Bay on\r\nthe 13th July. As the enemy showed no disposition to put to sea again,\r\nthe Caesar, and the rest of the fleet, remained quietly at Cawsand Bay,\r\nand subsequently at Torbay till the 2nd September, when they again\r\nsailed. In the course of the three ensuing months it put back three\r\ntimes; and finally, on the 8th of December 1799, when the Admiralty,\r\nbeing desirous of ascertaining whether Torbay was a safe anchorage for\r\nthe fleet during the winter months, ordered the Caesar to continue on\r\nthat station for the trial, and at the same time placed the London, of\r\n98 guns, under the orders of Sir James. The tempestuous weather which\r\nprevailed during the rest of the month, and throughout January,\r\nafforded several occasions to determine the point. The London, during\r\na heavy gale, parted her cables, and was with great difficulty\r\npreserved from going on shore, which left no doubt that it was an\r\ninsecure and unfit post to shelter a fleet.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th March 1800, Lord Bridport took command of the fleet, which\r\nwas soon after increased to twenty-five sail of the line; but nothing\r\nremarkable occurred till the 18th of May, when a dreadful gale\r\noccasioned much damage to many of the ships. The wind was at first\r\nS.W. and blew with great violence, when it suddenly checked to the\r\nN.W., before the S.W. sea had time to subside: most of the fleet wore.\r\nThe Lady Jane, Trompeuse, and Railleur foundered: the Montague lost\r\nall her masts, and several others met with damage. It appears by the\r\nlog of the Caesar that she continued for some time on the same tack,\r\nwhich may account for her having sustained little injury, although it\r\nmentions that she shipped several heavy seas. So tremendous was the\r\nrolling of the ship, that her lower yard-arms were at one time under\r\nwater, while the carpenters stood by with their axes, to cut the masts\r\naway, if she had not righted. She did not bear up for Torbay with the\r\nrest of the fleet, but followed two days after, and, having\r\nreplenished her water and provisions, resumed her station, from whence\r\nSir James wrote a letter to Lady Saumarez, of which the following is\r\nan extract:\r\n\r\n   \"Caesar, 26th June, 1800.\r\n\r\n   \"Of the enemy in this neighbourhood we know nothing, except of\r\n   their inactivity. I hope they do not mean to leave so fine a\r\n   fleet, as we have here, useless all the summer. Fear not my\r\n   complying with your injunctions. I shall more than ever strive\r\n   against _ennui_,--my greatest enemy, I believe, whilst in this\r\n   inactive state. I read when I can, but anxiety to hear from you,\r\n   and to have accounts of our darling children, has its share in\r\n   withdrawing my attention and fixing it on more interesting\r\n   subjects. Of one thing, however, be assured, that with respect\r\n   to the ship and all thereto belonging, I am as well situated as\r\n   possible. I enjoy the satisfaction of having a very quiet and\r\n   well-disposed ship's company, who are kept orderly, and, I\r\n   flatter myself, well regulated, without exercising severity or\r\n   rigour. The officers continue as I wish them. Captain Maxwell,\r\n   who joined some time ago, is an active, diligent officer in his\r\n   corps; and Mr. Packwood, as well as Mr. Holliday, our new\r\n   chaplain, are very good men in their respective stations.\r\n\r\n   \"Although I find amusement in books, believe me your letters\r\n   form my sole delight, and tend more to lighten the time than all\r\n   the volumes in Hoxland's library.\"\r\n\r\nSir James, after another cruise, returned on the 24th of July, to\r\nprepare for a service of more responsibility and importance.\r\n\r\nThe French had now a large fleet at Brest, which appeared to be in a\r\nstate of great forwardness; and, as they had before eluded the\r\nvigilance of the blockading ships, it was necessary to place a strong\r\nsquadron near the Black Rocks to watch their motions, and to give the\r\ncommand of this advanced detachment to an officer of skill,\r\nexperience, and intrepidity. Earl St. Vincent, who was now\r\ncommander-in-chief of the Channel fleet, knowing how highly Sir James\r\nSaumarez was qualified for such an important trust, gave him the\r\nfollowing order to take command of the in-shore squadron:\r\n\r\n   You are hereby required and directed to proceed without a\r\n   moment's loss of time, in his Majesty's ship under your command,\r\n   off the Black Rocks, where you may expect to find his Majesty's\r\n   ships named in the margin,[24] which you are to take under your\r\n   command; their respective captains being instructed to obey your\r\n   orders: and having received from Captain Knight, of his\r\n   Majesty's ship Montague, authenticated copies of all orders and\r\n   papers in his possession relative to the command of the advanced\r\n   squadron, carry the same into execution until you receive\r\n   further orders.\r\n\r\n   You will also receive from Captain Knight a sealed secret\r\n   instruction, addressed to the officer commanding the advanced\r\n   squadron off the Black Rocks for the time being, which is on no\r\n   account to be opened, but under the circumstances thereon\r\n   directed.\r\n\r\n   ST. VINCENT.\r\n\r\n   To Sir James Saumarez, &c.\r\n\r\n   [24] Magnificent, Defiance, Marlborough, and Edgar.\r\n\r\n   Copy of Instructions to the Senior Officer of the advanced\r\n   squadron off the Black Rocks.\r\n\r\n   You are hereby required and directed to take under your command\r\n   the advanced squadron, composed of his Majesty's ships named on\r\n   the other side hereof, (whose captains are instructed to obey\r\n   your orders,) stationed off the Black Rocks and in the Bay of\r\n   Brest, for the purpose of watching the combined fleets in that\r\n   port; adopting such measures as you shall judge necessary for\r\n   gaining every possible information of their force, condition,\r\n   and movements.\r\n\r\n   In the execution of this most important service, the\r\n   line-of-battle ships (composing the advanced squadron) are to be\r\n   anchored during an easterly wind in the Iroise Passage, as well\r\n   to support the look-out frigates, as to intercept a squadron of\r\n   the enemy which is held in constant readiness to slip out the\r\n   very first opportunity that shall offer; and during a westerly\r\n   wind, you are not to fail in making Brest every day, if\r\n   possible, but at all events to take such precautions as will\r\n   enable you to resume your former position in the Iroise, on the\r\n   first appearance of easterly wind.\r\n\r\n   You are to communicate to me from time to time every\r\n   intelligence you may obtain respecting the enemy; and in case he\r\n   should come out in great force, while the squadron under my\r\n   command is in this rendezvous, you are to give me immediate\r\n   notice thereof, and also the officers commanding the detachments\r\n   off the Passage Du Raz, Isle Grois, and in Quiberon Bay; but, in\r\n   the event of my being compelled by tempestuous weather to take\r\n   shelter in Torbay, and of the enemy seizing that opportunity of\r\n   putting to sea, you are to give me information thereof by every\r\n   means in your power: taking under your command the detachments\r\n   off the Passage Du Raz, Isle Grois, and in Quiberon Bay,\r\n   together with the ships named in the margin,[25] which are\r\n   directed to keep as near the Black Rocks as possible, under the\r\n   orders of Captain Sutton, for the support of your ships; and to\r\n   hang upon and use your utmost endeavours to harass the enemy's\r\n   rear until the approach of this squadron, which, you may be\r\n   assured, will be in pursuit.\r\n\r\n   Given on board the Royal George,\r\n   off Ushant, 7th August 1800.\r\n   ST. VINCENT.\r\n\r\n   To Sir John Borlase Warren,\r\n   Bart. K.B. Rear-admiral of\r\n   the Blue, &c. &c. &c.\r\n   By command of the Admiral.\r\n   BEN. TUCKER.\r\n\r\n   An exact copy.  Given the 8th August 1800\r\n   JOHN BORLASE WARREN.\r\n\r\n   [25] Superb and Captain.\r\n\r\nSir James now proceeded, in the Caesar, to assume the important command\r\noff the Black Rocks, which had deservedly obtained the name of New\r\nSiberia, as being the least desirable of stations for a ship-of-war.\r\nIt is, indeed, scarcely possible to describe any situation more\r\nmiserable; for, besides being at the very entrance of a port\r\ncontaining twenty-five sail of the line ready for sea, which might\r\nslip out and attack the squadron of six, the ships are two-thirds\r\nsurrounded with rocks and dangers, which afford no shelter; while they\r\nare open to the S.W. winds. They have often great difficulty in\r\nworking out, sometimes against the tide as well as against the wind;\r\nand, in reconnoitring, they are exposed to the fire of the enemy on\r\neach side of Brest Water.\r\n\r\nThe following extracts of private letters written by Sir James to Lady\r\nSaumarez, will be found interesting, as they convey the best idea of\r\nhis situation.\r\n\r\n   Caesar, off the Black Rocks, Sunday evening,\r\n   2d Sept. 1800.\r\n\r\n   _On dit_, but I do not believe it, that the French fleet is to\r\n   be ordered out by the First Consul, at all risks. We may\r\n   therefore expect to make _minced meat_ of them with our\r\n   seventeen three-deckers. We remain in sight of the enemy\r\n   unmolested by them. To-day I had the colours hoisted, to show\r\n   them Sunday was not expunged from _our_ calendar; and divine\r\n   service was performed on board.\r\n\r\n   Our boats have occasionally landed on some small islands near\r\n   this. Captain Buller purchased two nice little cows, one of\r\n   which he has spared me: it is so tame, the children could play\r\n   with it. It supplies me with milk, and cost me only three\r\n   guineas.\r\n\r\n   The Guernsey traders continue with the squadron; but, on account\r\n   of the spirits they sell to the ships, I wish them further off.\r\n   I have been obliged to be harsh with them, from this\r\n   circumstance; and I expect they will give a very bad report of\r\n   their countryman when they return to the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Caesar, off the Black Rocks, Sept. 12th 1800.\r\n\r\n   Sir Henry Harvey has joined the fleet, which makes up the\r\n   complement of flags; and it remains to be proved if the Earl has\r\n   influence to effect what he so strenuously aims at respecting\r\n   the promotion. I form very sanguine hopes that peace will\r\n   shortly extend its blessed influence over these countries; and\r\n   that I shall have the satisfaction to enjoy, without\r\n   interruption, the sweets of domestic comfort. I certainly shall\r\n   avail myself of the earliest respite the service will enable me\r\n   to pass in the island; and I think I may have that opportunity\r\n   this winter; for if the war should be continued, there is no\r\n   doubt that a promotion would give me, at least, six weeks\r\n   interval from duty; at any rate, I see no reason for the future\r\n   affording you anxiety, as whether there, or in England, I depend\r\n   on our passing a considerable portion of the winter together. I\r\n   hope Master Saumarez knows his alpha, beta, &c. by heart. When\r\n   convenient to the young gentleman, I shall be glad that he will\r\n   take the trouble to transcribe it for me to Omega, as I have no\r\n   Greek grammar by me. I can readily believe the difficulty that\r\n   attends fixing the little ladies to the French grammar, whose\r\n   particularly quick and lively temper is not much suited to so\r\n   tedious a process. I think, notwithstanding, it is the best\r\n   method, especially as the same grammatical rules are adapted to\r\n   any language, which they will find useful hereafter. Dancing, no\r\n   doubt, has more attractions. I trust they have quite got rid of\r\n   their colds: their papa has also had a very severe one, and kept\r\n   his cabin for two days; but he is now perfectly recovered.\r\n\r\n   September 18th. I admire N., with his comments on Colchester.\r\n   When you next write, recommend him to try the Black Rocks in a\r\n   thick fog, and no chance of letters from England: he will find\r\n   even Norman Cross preferable. I, however, believe I have done\r\n   with that anchorage for some time, as the wind is set in to the\r\n   westward; and I shall now cruise to prevent vessels going into\r\n   Brest.\r\n\r\n   I am happy to say I am perfectly well. I trust my nerves will\r\n   prove equal to the task; as I have before often told you, they\r\n   generally strengthen with difficulties.\r\n\r\n   I mean to make this cruise long enough to entitle me to a\r\n   relief, therefore do not expect me in port as long as I can keep\r\n   the sea.\r\n\r\nSir James immediately gave such orders and regulations as would best\r\nguard against, or overcome, the difficulties inseparable from such a\r\nservice; and, with the prospect of a long winter before him, he sent\r\nthese regulations, and a list of the rendezvous appointed by him, to\r\nthe commander-in-chief, whose letter to Sir James, in answer, is\r\nexpressive of the high opinion he entertained of him.\r\n\r\n   Ville de Paris, off Ushant, 15th Sept. 1800.\r\n\r\n   SIR,\r\n\r\n   Nothing can be more appropriate than the different rendezvous\r\n   you have sent me a copy of; your change of position must\r\n   fluctuate according to the sudden changes of the weather, which\r\n   are to be looked for soon. I repose such unbounded confidence in\r\n   your zeal and judgment that _I sleep as soundly as if I had the\r\n   key of Brest in my possession_.\r\n\r\n   Sir Richard Strachan and Captain Buller, in the Captain and\r\n   Edgar, will relieve two of the ships which last joined you as\r\n   soon as they return to this rendezvous, and the Canada will\r\n   relieve the third. As I have applied for Captain Foley's leave\r\n   of absence on very important private business, I wish the\r\n   Elephant to be the first sent to me. I am, sir,\r\n\r\n   Your most obedient humble servant,\r\n   ST. VINCENT.\r\n\r\n   Sir James Saumarez.\r\n\r\nIt was supposed that the Brest fleet would take advantage of the\r\nequinoctial gales, which were now approaching, and slip out as before,\r\nwhen the in-shore squadron was blown off, or compelled to bear up for\r\nTorbay; but Sir James had determined on frustrating their attempt. On\r\nthe 23rd a heavy gale came on, which, in former instances, would have\r\nobliged the in-shore squadron to abandon the post; but, instead of\r\nbearing up for Torbay when no longer able to maintain his position,\r\nSir James steered for Douvarnenez Bay, where he anchored with the\r\nwhole squadron, just out of range of the enemy's mortar batteries,\r\nwhich soon tried their shells, but without effect.\r\n\r\nHere his squadron struck top-masts and lower yards, and rode out all\r\nthe equinoctial gales, actually in the enemy's harbour, within a few\r\nmiles of their whole fleet of four times his force, and in perfect\r\nsafety! The gale had been very severe; and although Earl St. Vincent,\r\nwho was obliged to run with his fleet for Torbay, had no fears for the\r\nsafety of the in-shore squadron, relying as he did on the experience\r\nand skill of Sir James, yet the Admiralty were in a considerable state\r\nof alarm until the following account of his proceedings was received:\r\n\r\n   TO THE RIGHT HON. EARL SPENCER.\r\n   Caesar, Douvarnenez Bay, 26th Sept. 1800.\r\n\r\n   MY LORD,\r\n\r\n   On the supposition that the fleet may have been driven from\r\n   their station by the late tempestuous weather, and as some\r\n   anxiety may be excited for the safety of this squadron, I take\r\n   the opportunity by the Marlborough to inform your lordship of my\r\n   having anchored in this bay last Tuesday evening, with the ships\r\n   under my command, where we have ridden the gale out in perfect\r\n   safety, together with the Montague and Naiad, which ships\r\n   anchored here on Wednesday.\r\n\r\n   This is a most spacious bay, and may be considered safe\r\n   anchorage in any weather: it lies about four leagues to the\r\n   southward of Brest; from which port it is only separated about\r\n   five miles by land, over a mountainous and hilly country. As the\r\n   same winds that enable the enemy's fleet to put to sea, also\r\n   lead out of this bay, we can always be in time for them; and\r\n   this appears the most favourable position to prevent their\r\n   coasting convoys coming from the southern ports. The enemy has\r\n   endeavoured to annoy the squadron with shells, but at too great\r\n   a distance to reach any of the ships, and the whole fleet may\r\n   lie in perfect safety from any of the batteries.\r\n\r\n   I purpose to remain here until the weather becomes more\r\n   moderate, to enable me to resume the station off the Black\r\n   Rocks. In the mean time, ships will occasionally be detached to\r\n   watch the motions of the enemy in Brest Water. I have the honour\r\n   to be, &c.\r\n\r\n   JAS. SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\nIn answer to this, Sir James received the following letter from Earl\r\nSpencer, then First Lord of the Admiralty.\r\n\r\n   Admiralty, 30th Sept. 1800.\r\n\r\n   DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n   I am much obliged to you for your letter of the 26th, dated from\r\n   Douvarnenez Bay, and was much pleased to find that you had got\r\n   hold of that anchorage, as I felt very uneasy at your absence\r\n   during the late gales. I should rather doubt whether that bay\r\n   could be capacious enough for a large fleet to anchor in without\r\n   danger from the batteries; but I have always hoped that some of\r\n   our small squadron might avail themselves of that resource on\r\n   such an occasion as that which has presented itself to you; and\r\n   I have no doubt that the doing so will much assist the\r\n   occupation of our fleet off Brest.\r\n\r\n   Believe me, dear sir,\r\n   Your very faithful humble servant,\r\n\r\n   SPENCER.\r\n   To Sir James Saumarez.\r\n\r\nSir James, at the same time, wrote to Earl St. Vincent by the\r\nMarlborough, giving his lordship an account of his proceedings, which\r\ncould not but be highly satisfactory.\r\n\r\n   Caesar, Douvarnenez Bay, 26th September 1800.\r\n\r\n   MY LORD,\r\n\r\n   The weather not having admitted the stores and provisions to be\r\n   taken out of the Marlborough whilst under sail, I bore up for\r\n   this anchorage with the squadron; and early Wednesday morning\r\n   the boats were all employed in conveying the water and\r\n   provisions to the squadron: but it having continued to blow\r\n   excessively hard from that time, it was not until this morning\r\n   we have been enabled to accomplish this service.\r\n\r\n   The Montague and Naiad anchored in the bay Wednesday morning,\r\n   and are now under sail. It has blown a very severe gale of wind\r\n   at north-west the last two days, and we have saved considerable\r\n   wear and tear to all the ships by having taken this anchorage in\r\n   good time.\r\n\r\n   I propose to remain here during the continuation of westerly\r\n   winds, or until the weather enables me to resume the station off\r\n   the Black Rocks; detaching ships occasionally to watch the\r\n   enemy's motions.\r\n\r\n   I have the honour to be Your lordship's most obedient and most\r\n   humble servant,\r\n\r\n   JAMES SAUMAREZ.\r\n   The Right Honourable the Earl of St. Vincent, &c. &c. &c.\r\n\r\nThe following is an extract of a letter which Sir James wrote to Lady\r\nSaumarez, and sent by the same opportunity. It will be found to give\r\nan accurate description of the important anchorage of which he was the\r\nfirst who was so daring as to take advantage in stormy weather, with\r\nthe squadron under his command.\r\n\r\n   Caesar, Douvarnenez Bay, Sept. 24th, 1800.\r\n\r\n   We anchored at eleven last night, and this morning found\r\n   ourselves in one of the finest bays I have ever seen. It is far\r\n   more spacious than Torbay, and much more enclosed; consequently\r\n   more secure against all winds. It is the same distance from\r\n   Brest by sea as Dartmouth is from Torbay; and by land the same\r\n   as from Brixham, not being more than five miles across, over a\r\n   hilly country; substituting the Bec de Chevre for the Berry\r\n   Head, and it exactly forms the counter part to Torbay. It\r\n   abounds with the finest fish, of which we shall profit.\r\n\r\n   As it is not possible for the ships to sail from Brest but with\r\n   an easterly wind, which blows directly out of this bay, we can\r\n   always be beforehand with them.\r\n\r\n   25th.--It has continued to blow hard since we entered this bay,\r\n   and it has now risen to a severe storm. I wish you knew how\r\n   well sheltered we are in this famous anchorage. Captain\r\n   Pierrepont has been with me since yesterday: he has been near\r\n   fourteen weeks at sea, and, as you may suppose, very tired. I am\r\n   better satisfied with my situation than since I have been in the\r\n   Channel fleet, and find it far preferable to being attached to\r\n   it.\r\n\r\n   Monday, 29th Sept.\r\n\r\n   I trust my letter by the Marlborough has reached you this\r\n   morning, which will have set your mind at ease as to our safety\r\n   after the gales we encountered last week. I wrote to you\r\n   yesterday, but too hastily to express, as I wished, the\r\n   happiness I derived from having just received your letters of\r\n   the 15th and 19th. They had been too long and too anxiously\r\n   looked for not to receive the most cordial and heartfelt\r\n   welcome. I am in hourly expectation of seeing the fleet, the\r\n   letters from the Earl acquainting me with his intention of\r\n   putting to sea the moment the weather moderated. The Superb,\r\n   with Centaur and Warrior, hove in sight this afternoon,--the\r\n   only ships I have seen since last Tuesday, when I went into\r\n   Douvarnenez Bay; and I have the satisfaction to reflect that,\r\n   notwithstanding the tempestuous weather, this squadron has been\r\n   enabled to keep its station, although all the other detachments\r\n   have been driven from theirs. Now that your letter gives me\r\n   reason to believe you entertain serious thoughts of going to\r\n   Guernsey, like your father I lose my courage at the prospect of\r\n   it. I sincerely wish I had never suggested the idea, which I was\r\n   induced to do from the hope of the war being over, and that you\r\n   would pass the winter more comfortably than in England during\r\n   the dreary months. I am now become a very coward on the subject,\r\n   and leave it to you to determine as you think best; at the same\r\n   time assuring you that I shall endeavour to be reconciled to\r\n   whatever plan is adopted which is most likely to conduce to your\r\n   comfort. Your account of our dear girls gives me the most\r\n   heartfelt satisfaction, and of the increasing strength of the\r\n   sweet dove in particular, whom I truly long to behold,--a\r\n   happiness I still hope to enjoy ere many weeks are elapsed. I\r\n   shall expect a letter from the dear boy by the next opportunity\r\n   from Plymouth.\r\n\r\nThe next letter to the Earl of St. Vincent gives an account of the\r\nfurther proceedings of his squadron, and the situation of the enemy's\r\nfleet in Brest, which proves how successful his endeavours had been in\r\npreventing its meditated escape.\r\n\r\n   Caesar, off the Black Rocks, 28th September 1800.\r\n\r\n   MY LORD,\r\n\r\n   Soon after I despatched my letter by the Marlborough, dated from\r\n   Douvarnenez Bay, the wind having shifted to the northward, I got\r\n   under sail with the squadron; but in the evening it came to the\r\n   south-west, with thick weather: I returned to the anchorage, as\r\n   did Captain Knight, with the Montague and Naiad.\r\n\r\n   It continued to blow very strong till yesterday noon, when the\r\n   wind suddenly shifted to N. and N. by E. I immediately got under\r\n   sail, and stood out of the bay; the Pompee leaving a\r\n   bower-anchor, her cable having parted in endeavouring to weigh\r\n   it. From the report of several signal-guns fired in Brest soon\r\n   after the sudden change of wind, I have no doubt of the\r\n   preparatory movements of the enemy to put to sea, had the wind\r\n   continued favourable for them; and I carried a press of sail\r\n   during the night, in order to be off St. Matthew's Point early\r\n   this morning to watch their motions.\r\n\r\n   I had a full view of the enemy's fleet, and counted twenty-two\r\n   sail with their top-gallant-masts struck, but apparently ready\r\n   for sea. Having made the signal to the Megaera to reconnoitre, I\r\n   beg to refer your lordship to Captain Hill for a more particular\r\n   report of their state and numbers.\r\n\r\n   I have the honour to be, my lord,\r\n   Your lordship's obedient and most humble servant,\r\n   JAMES SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n   The Right Honourable the Earl of St. Vincent, &c. &c. &c.\r\n\r\n   His Majesty's ship Montague, with the Naiad, and Suwarrow\r\n   schooner, went through the bay yesterday evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Ville de Paris, Torbay, 4th October, 1800.\r\n\r\n   SIR,\r\n\r\n   I have to acknowledge the receipt of your several letters of the\r\n   25th, 26th, 28th ultimo, and 1st instant, detailing your\r\n   proceedings with his Majesty's ships under your orders; the\r\n   whole of which I very much approve, particularly the taking\r\n   under your command Captains Sutton and King, with the ships and\r\n   vessels attached to them: and you will herewith receive orders\r\n   to their respective captains and commanders to put themselves\r\n   under your command, and obey your orders for their future\r\n   proceedings in the important duty of watching the combined\r\n   fleets.\r\n\r\n   I am, sir, your most obedient servant,\r\n   ST. VINCENT.\r\n\r\n   Sir James Saumarez.\r\n\r\nBy this bold and unexpected step, (which the French have since\r\ncharacterised as a piece of _impudence_,) Sir James completely\r\nfrustrated the meditated escape of the combined fleets, which were\r\nnow thirty-two in number, seven of which were three-deckers. He had,\r\nmoreover, the honour of being the first to defy the enemy in his own\r\nanchorage, proving at the same time that it would not be so easy as\r\nformerly to elude the vigilance of the advanced squadron.\r\n\r\nThe weather having moderated after the second return to Douvarnenez\r\nBay, the squadron resumed the anchorage near the Black Rocks, daily\r\nreconnoitring the enemy, destroying several small vessels which\r\nattempted to get in, and keeping under sail when the wind was\r\nwesterly. In continuation to Lady Saumarez he writes:\r\n\r\n   Oct. 4th 1800.\r\n\r\n   The anxiety inseparable from this cruise is very considerably\r\n   alleviated from knowing the fleet is in port, which must prove\r\n   of the greatest benefit both to officers and men, and to the\r\n   service in general. I find the rumours of peace are vanished,\r\n   and that war is determined upon. I trust events will be\r\n   favourable to this country. There is no doubt the French are\r\n   much distressed for provisions in the neighbourhood of Brest,\r\n   and that discontent prevails among their troops, who are\r\n   ill-paid, ill-fed, and badly clothed. It is horrid to see the\r\n   leading men of all nations so infatuated for war, at a time\r\n   peace is so much to be desired for the sake of humanity.\r\n\r\n   Caesar, Bay of Brest, 18th Oct.\r\n\r\n   The delightful weather we have enjoyed this last week has\r\n   enabled me to remain at anchor off the Black Rocks. They have\r\n   lost their gloom from the serene atmosphere, but more\r\n   particularly from having had such frequent tidings from you, as\r\n   scarce a day has passed (I believe not one) without being joined\r\n   by something from the fleet. Yesterday, the Earl sent me a\r\n   message that he expected my flag to be hoisted in a very few\r\n   days; and Troubridge writes to me the promotion was to extend to\r\n   Sir Edward Pellew; and,--what think you!--that Lord St. Vincent\r\n   has actually written for Captain Brenton to be appointed my\r\n   flag-captain. His lordship, in his letter, tells me that Capt.\r\n   Thornbrough is to remain in the Mars, and will relieve me here,\r\n   if the measure he has proposed is acceded to: so you may\r\n   perceive I have some grounds on which to form my hopes; but I do\r\n   not wish _you_ to dwell too much upon it.\r\n\r\n   21st.--I am now _solus_. Captain Brenton, who I mentioned had\r\n   been staying with me, is gone to the Ville de Paris. I know no\r\n   one I should prefer as captain under my flag. He is a steady,\r\n   sensible, good officer, and of great experience, having served\r\n   several years with admirals as a lieutenant. Captain Cook dined\r\n   with me to-day on a _Black Rock_ dinner, viz. a fine piece of\r\n   salmon and a nice little _cochon-de-lait_, with _entremets_,\r\n   removes, &c. The salmon was sent me with a basket of vegetables\r\n   from Plymouth, I suspect from Captain Markham; the roaster was a\r\n   present from Captain Hood, who, being under sail, could not dine\r\n   with me. I mention these trifles because I know they please you.\r\n   The boats occasionally go to the small islands and procure\r\n   bullocks, &c.; and, as fast as the stock is purchased, they\r\n   contrive to replenish it from the mainland,--a proof they are\r\n   well satisfied with the price we pay for it, which is fixed by\r\n   themselves.\r\n\r\n   26th Oct.--After near a fortnight passed at what the Earl now\r\n   calls the Elysian Lake (instead of Siberia), a westerly wind\r\n   compelled me to get under sail yesterday afternoon; and it was\r\n   fortunate that I did so, as it has blown a gale since that time.\r\n   By the Megaera, which has joined me this evening, I find the\r\n   fleet is to go to Torbay; and, from what Sir Thomas Troubridge\r\n   writes, I conjecture the Earl intends to go on shore part of the\r\n   winter.... While we remained at an anchor the boats of the\r\n   squadron were occasionally detached in pursuit of the enemy's\r\n   vessels. Last Monday they chased one close under the batteries\r\n   at the entrance of Brest, which has afforded me an opportunity\r\n   of making favourable mention of Mr. Lamborn and Mr. Wood, who\r\n   were employed on that service. The Earl has desired me to send\r\n   the latter to him to be promoted. The Canada, which was ordered\r\n   to cover the boats, took possession of three Spaniards belonging\r\n   to the Principe de Asturias, Don Gravina's flag-ship, who were\r\n   fishing in a small boat. They are to be returned without being\r\n   exchanged, agreeably to what I suggested, and I shall send in a\r\n   flag of truce the first favourable weather. We were so\r\n   comfortably anchored the last fortnight, and so agreeably\r\n   employed, that it has nearly spoilt me for the remainder of the\r\n   cruise. Of the promotion nothing further is said, and I have not\r\n   heard when I am to be released. If I am kept out much longer,\r\n   and have the duty of an admiral without my flag, I fear I shall\r\n   grow _sulky_ and impatient. It is not improbable Captain Sutton\r\n   may relieve me in the charge of this squadron, as I doubt Sir\r\n   Edward Pellew being yet ready. I fear the second return of the\r\n   fleet will have again set your heart palpitating, and caused you\r\n   another disappointment at the Caesar not being with it.\r\n\r\n   October 30th.--Yesterday I received a very civil reply to the\r\n   letter I wrote to Don Gravina, who wishes that I may live many\r\n   thousand years. The French received the officer from the Canada\r\n   who was entrusted with the flag of truce with great politeness.\r\n   I sent Maingy from this ship as interpreter. They remained at\r\n   Camaret till the following morning. You will not be displeased\r\n   to hear that the Caesar must go into port _from necessity_,\r\n   having sprung her main-yard; but, if possible, I shall delay it\r\n   three or four weeks longer, notwithstanding my _threat_ of\r\n   losing patience. I shall depend on finding you at Dartmouth.\r\n\r\n   Caesar, Nov. 1st.\r\n\r\n   I remain without any of your letters since the 20th, which I\r\n   feel a grievous circumstance, particularly at this time, when I\r\n   am left in doubt whether you are still at Dartmouth, or gone to\r\n   Bath. This morning I experienced a severe disappointment. The\r\n   Nile cutter, whose tardy approach for four hours was anxiously\r\n   waited for, at last joined without any letters, having left\r\n   Plymouth with sealed orders. We have such blessed weather at\r\n   present that it is almost impious to be discontented; yet I\r\n   cannot enjoy it while I remain so long without hearing from you.\r\n   I accuse the Earl of indifference to the comfort of those whom\r\n   it is incumbent on him to attend to. Since he has left this\r\n   station there has been scarcely a day that the wind has not been\r\n   favourable for vessels to join us. A fortnight or three weeks\r\n   more and I hope my turn will come, when, if things do not meet\r\n   my expectations, I shall be tempted to take leave of the good\r\n   ship, and look out for a snug cottage to pass some time in the\r\n   enjoyment of your society. I am serious, _je t'assure_. I\r\n   understand Sir Hyde Parker is to command in the absence of the\r\n   chief. _Cela ne me plait pas aucunement_; for, after having been\r\n   employed upon this important and arduous service with\r\n   acknowledged credit, I shall certainly very ill brook being\r\n   hurried out of port in the usual manner to serve with him: I\r\n   therefore _go on shore_ unless my views are complied with. I\r\n   hope to-morrow to have letters from you to acknowledge the\r\n   receipt of. At present I am much out of humour, and with too\r\n   much cause to be easily reconciled on any other terms but of\r\n   hearing from you.\r\n\r\n   2nd.--Another disappointment this morning, having been joined by\r\n   a lugger which we hoped had letters, but which proves to be from\r\n   another quarter. I look for the Nimrod: if she joins us\r\n   to-morrow I shall be satisfied. It has blown strong all day,\r\n   with very thick weather. I hope for better success, but I still\r\n   continue out of temper.\r\n\r\n   3rd.--The Superb, which has been in sight since daylight, is at\r\n   last joining. Imagine my impatience after a whole fortnight\r\n   since the date of your last letter. Captain Sutton, who is now\r\n   with me, has not brought a single letter. I send this by the\r\n   Courageux, and have only time to say that the Edgar is hourly\r\n   expected, and possibly we may be more fortunate. A ship is in\r\n   sight: I hope it is her.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of November the fleet experienced one of the severest gales\r\never known, which did immense damage to the shipping; but, except the\r\nloss of some storm-sails, the Caesar sustained no injury; while several\r\nof the others lost masts and yards, obliging them to return to port.\r\nBut Sir James kept his station; indeed, during the whole fifteen weeks\r\nhe had the command, not a vessel either sailed from, or entered, the\r\nharbour of Brest.\r\n\r\nAt last, seeing their escape impossible, they began to dismantle the\r\nships; and Sir James received the following letter from Earl St.\r\nVincent:\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n   The Impetueux took in her guns this day, and Sir Edward Pellew\r\n   will receive his orders to-morrow morning; and, if the wind\r\n   favours his getting out of Hamoaze, he will be with you in the\r\n   course of the week. You will receive by him orders to proceed to\r\n   Spithead; but I shall be very glad to see you here _en route_,\r\n   and I will inform Lady Saumarez by to-morrow's post of your\r\n   probable approach.\r\n\r\n   Lord Spencer has been fully impressed by me of the long and\r\n   arduous service you have undergone, and seems well disposed to\r\n   give you the respite so justly due to the cheerfulness with\r\n   which you have conducted the most important employment of this\r\n   war. I am not in the secret when the promotion is to take\r\n   effect. Private letters from town and the newspapers are full of\r\n   it, and I am morally certain it will be out soon; for one of the\r\n   ninety-gun ships, commanded by an officer very near the head of\r\n   the list of captains, is nominated for Sir Erasmus Gower's flag,\r\n   which appears conclusive.\r\n\r\n   Sir Hyde Parker has asked leave of absence; and, as the size of\r\n   the fleet of observation is much reduced, I conceive it will be\r\n   granted.\r\n\r\n   Yours, most truly,\r\n   Torr Abbey, 2nd December, 1800.\r\n   ST. VINCENT.\r\n\r\n   To Sir James Saumarez.\r\n\r\nThe following extract, which alludes to the preceding, was written by\r\nSir James to Lady Saumarez on the\r\n\r\n   29th Dec.--The Earl informs me of his intention to write to you.\r\n   I perceive he is resolved to become a favourite of yours by his\r\n   attention. The order for the Caesar to anchor in Torbay for\r\n   twenty-four hours, on her way to Portsmouth, will not lessen his\r\n   favour with you. After this, I suppose I cannot do less than\r\n   invite you to take a passage in the ship with your two dear\r\n   little companions; but it must be on condition that the weather\r\n   is propitious to my views.\r\n\r\nThe station off the Black Rocks had hitherto been considered tenable\r\nonly by frigates during the winter; on which service three or four\r\nwere annually employed; but which, like the Channel fleet,\r\noccasionally took refuge in Torbay. It had been, however, resolved\r\nupon by Earl St. Vincent to form an advanced squadron of six sail of\r\nthe line; and Sir James, as we have before stated, was the officer\r\nselected to proceed on this arduous and important undertaking. None\r\nbut professional men who have been in that anxious and perilous\r\nservice can have any idea of its difficulties. In such a situation the\r\ncommanding-officer must consider himself constantly in the scene of\r\naction, surrounded by dangers of every description, exposed to the\r\nviolence of storms, and sailing amidst a multitude of rocks and\r\nvariable currents, in the longest and darkest nights, and often on a\r\nlee-shore on the enemy's coast, while the whole of their fleet is\r\nnear, and ready to take advantage of any disaster, or change of wind\r\nor circumstance that might arise in their favour.\r\n\r\nIt has already been shown that Sir James performed this duty to the\r\nentire satisfaction of the noble Earl, and to the country. No storm\r\never obliged him to leave his station, which has justly been\r\ndenominated _the post of honour_.\r\n\r\nWe cannot conclude this chapter with more satisfaction than by\r\nsubjoining the following interesting correspondence between Sir James\r\nand Earl Spencer, which no longer need be characterised as \"secret.\"\r\n\r\n   _Secret and confidential._\r\n\r\n   Caesar off Ushant, 20th June 1800.\r\n\r\n   At this time, when a proper example should be set to the seamen\r\n   of his Majesty's fleet, and a due sense of religion and the\r\n   practice of it kept up in the royal navy, permit me to suggest\r\n   to your lordship the propriety of a strong recommendation from\r\n   the Board of Admiralty to the commanders-in-chief on the\r\n   different stations (more particularly the Channel fleet) that\r\n   they will cause the public worship of Almighty God to be duly\r\n   and regularly performed on board the ships under their command,\r\n   and that nothing but the most pressing exigency shall prevent\r\n   Divine service from being publicly read every Sunday on board\r\n   the respective ships.\r\n\r\n   It is from the too flagrant neglect of this most essential part\r\n   of our duty that I have been impelled to write _in confidence_\r\n   to your lordship on the subject, with the hope that proper means\r\n   will be adopted to rectify it.\r\n\r\n   We have signals to denote that the ship's companies will have\r\n   time for dinner or breakfast; why should there not be one to\r\n   signify that they will have time for the performance of Divine\r\n   service? Were such a signal to be made from the ship of the\r\n   commander-in-chief on Sunday morning, it would be generally\r\n   followed by all the fleet, as they would then know the Admiral's\r\n   intention to give time for that purpose.\r\n\r\n   I trust that your lordship will do justice to the motives that\r\n   have induced me to write on the present subject, which I have\r\n   long had in contemplation, and which I have now decided upon\r\n   from the apprehensions that seem to be entertained of\r\n   disturbances among the seamen of this fleet, as I know nothing\r\n   that will contribute more to keep them in the right line of\r\n   their duty than a proper attention to religious principles, the\r\n   example to which should be set them by their officers.\r\n\r\n   I have the honour to be, with the greatest regard,\r\n   Your lordship's most faithful\r\n   and obedient humble servant,\r\n   JAS. SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n   The Right Hon. Earl Spencer, &c. &c. &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n   DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n   I have to acknowledge your letter of the 20th instant, and am\r\n   much obliged to you for the hint contained in it. You must be\r\n   aware how delicate a matter it is for me to interfere in a\r\n   detail of this description. I shall not, however, fail to make\r\n   such use of the suggestion as may appear to me to come within\r\n   the bounds of propriety, and may very probably produce the\r\n   desired effect.\r\n\r\n   I trust that the present alarm, which has been excited by\r\n   several circumstances of a suspicious nature, may prove\r\n   groundless; and I feel very strongly that nothing can more\r\n   probably contribute to make it so than every precaution being\r\n   taken in time to prevent an evil, which experience has already\r\n   proved to us, if suffered once to begin, is so very difficult to\r\n   remedy.\r\n\r\n   I am, dear sir,\r\n   Your very obedient humble servant,\r\n   SPENCER.\r\n   Admiralty, June 1800.\r\n\r\nThe Caesar arrived at Torbay on the 14th December, and on the 21st\r\nreached Spithead, where she remained during the rest of the year\r\n1800.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n1801.\r\n\r\n   Sir James Saumarez is promoted to the rank of\r\n   Rear-admiral.--Appointed to command the advanced\r\n   squadron.--Proceedings at the Black Rocks.--Douvarnenez\r\n   Bay.--Returns to England.--Appointed to command a squadron on a\r\n   very particular service.--His secret orders, &c. and letter of\r\n   approbation.--Ready for sea.--Is created a Baronet of the United\r\n   Kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of January 1801, a promotion of flag-officers took place,\r\nin order, it was said, to include the name of Sir James Saumarez; and\r\nthis flattering compliment was immediately followed by a further\r\nhonour, in his being ordered forthwith to hoist his flag on board his\r\nold ship, the Caesar; while Lieutenant Henryson, who was senior in that\r\nship, was promoted to the rank of commander. Sir James being ordered\r\nto fit for the same service in which he had lately been so\r\nsuccessfully employed, Captain Jahleel Brenton, who had been\r\nrecommended by Earl St. Vincent, and who had been a volunteer during\r\nthe last cruise, was appointed to the Caesar as his captain.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of January the ship came out of harbour, and having\r\nreceived her guns, and her stores and provisions for six months, the\r\nflag of Rear-admiral Sir James Saumarez was hoisted on the 24th; and\r\non the 25th of February he sailed to resume the command of the\r\nin-shore squadron off Brest, but joined the Channel fleet at Torbay on\r\nthe way thither. On the 7th March he arrived off the Black Rocks,\r\nwhere he relieved Admiral Thornbrough, and soon afterwards\r\nreconnoitred the harbour of Brest. On the 20th, the severe equinoctial\r\ngale forced the squadron into Douvarnenez Bay, where the ships\r\nanchored in eighteen fathoms, just out of reach of the enemy's shot.\r\nHere they remained, as much at their ease in the enemy's harbour as\r\nthey would have been at Spithead, and were never molested. On the 25th\r\nMarch, after two attempts to work out of the bay, the squadron resumed\r\ntheir station at the Black Rocks.\r\n\r\nThe following is extracted from a letter from one of the officers of\r\nthe Caesar, dated 26th March:\r\n\r\n   Our advanced squadron of the Channel fleet, commanded by Sir\r\n   James Saumarez, never quitted the French coast during the late\r\n   stormy weather. We anchored during the late violent gales in\r\n   Douvarnenez Bay, which is, in my opinion, one of the finest in\r\n   the universe. It is sheltered from every wind but those from W.\r\n   1/2 N. to W. 1/2 S.; and even that opening is protected by a\r\n   reef of rocks. Although the height of the gale was in the worst\r\n   direction it could have been, yet, having no very considerable\r\n   sea, we rode it out remarkably well. We lay, much to the\r\n   disappointment of the enemy, just out of gun-shot of the forts.\r\n   They favoured us, however, with some shells. We found, upon our\r\n   re-appearance off Brest, that six Spaniards had equiped\r\n   themselves, in addition to six Frenchmen, probably with a design\r\n   to attack us.\r\n\r\nThe Government having been relieved from their anxiety for the safety\r\nof the in-shore squadron by a despatch from Sir James, Earl St.\r\nVincent, who was now First Lord of the Admiralty, wrote to him the\r\nfollowing letter of approbation:\r\n\r\n     Admiralty, 1st April 1801.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR ADMIRAL,\r\n\r\n     The manner in which you have conducted the advanced squadron\r\n     calls upon me to repeat my admiration of it. Your taking the\r\n     anchorage in Douvarnenez Bay during the late equinoctial gales\r\n     has been of the utmost importance, and prevented the crippling\r\n     of one or more of your squadron. I heartily hope you continue\r\n     in good health, for which and every other blessing you have the\r\n     fervent wishes of\r\n     Your very sincere and obedient servant,\r\n     ST. VINCENT.\r\n\r\n     To R.A. Sir James Saumarez.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of this month, Sir James kept his squadron generally\r\nwithin three or four miles of the entrance of Brest, from which it was\r\nnever further than as many leagues. In this situation, and by\r\nfrequently reconnoitring in his own ship, he was enabled to watch the\r\npreparations of the enemy, and to frustrate their designs to attack\r\nhis squadron with a superior force; while he so completely blockaded\r\ntheir port that, as when he formerly commanded, no square-rigged\r\nvessel ever entered it, thereby preventing the necessary supplies of\r\nstores and provisions from reaching the depot of their navy. Nor did a\r\nsingle vessel escape the unwearied vigilance and perseverance of the\r\nadvanced squadron during the whole time it was under his command.\r\n\r\nEarly in May, letters reached him from Guernsey, intimating the great\r\napprehension his countrymen were under of invasion by the enemy; when\r\nhe wrote to Sir Thomas Troubridge, then one of the Lords of the\r\nAdmiralty, who sent the following answer:\r\n\r\n   Admiralty, 17th May 1801.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR SIR JAMES,\r\n\r\n   Many thanks for your kind letter of the 6th instant. I am sorry\r\n   our _French friends_ do not come out, that you may teach them\r\n   _English_. The Gazette[26] will show you that our soldiers are\r\n   getting into the habits of fighting.\r\n\r\n   We heard of the miscreants' intentions on the islands; and I\r\n   have sent over several gun-brigs, gun-barges, frigates, sloops,\r\n   &c. and a few additional troops. There are 5,000 regulars at\r\n   Jersey, and some more going soon, so that I think they have\r\n   little chance of success if they make the attempt; but it\r\n   appears to me that the different powers cannot look on without\r\n   interfering, and stopping the progress of the villains. In\r\n   short, I hope to see them soon weighed down in a congress.\r\n\r\n   Lord St. Vincent's cough is better, and the warm weather will\r\n   re-establish him. I beg you to give my best compliments to\r\n   Brenton. Believe me\r\n\r\n   Yours most faithfully,\r\n   THOMAS TROUBRIDGE.\r\n\r\n   To Sir James Saumarez.\r\n\r\n   [26] Battle of Alexandria.\r\n\r\nThus released from the painful anxiety for the safety of the Channel\r\nislands, where so many of his dearest connexions resided, he wrote the\r\nfollowing letter to his brother, Sir Thomas Saumarez, who was at that\r\ntime in command of the local force in Guernsey:\r\n\r\n   Caesar, off Ushant, 30th May 1801.\r\n\r\n   I have received your kind letter of the 17th, and am happy to\r\n   hear that a considerable force has been sent for the protection\r\n   of Guernsey and the other islands. They cannot be too well taken\r\n   care of, when we consider the infinite mischief they would do to\r\n   Great Britain, should they fall into the enemy's hands.\r\n\r\n   I am in daily expectation of being relieved by Admiral\r\n   Thornbrough, after a fourteen weeks' cruise, which is rather a\r\n   longer period than the Earl intended when I sailed from\r\n   Spithead. Brenton is everything that can be desired. I have\r\n   found in him a most excellent officer and a most agreeable\r\n   companion.\r\n\r\nIt appears by his journal, that on the following day he received the\r\nwelcome orders which put an end to his long and harassing cruise; also\r\na private letter of importance from Earl Spencer: and, being relieved\r\nby Admiral Thornbrough on the 1st of June, he arrived on the 2nd at\r\nCawsand Bay. Having reported the return of the Caesar, he received in\r\nanswer the following letters from Earl St. Vincent and Mr. Nepean:\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR SIR, Admiralty, 4th June 1801.\r\n\r\n   I am glad the Caesar is in Cawsand Bay, because you will be the\r\n   sooner informed of his Majesty's most gracious intentions\r\n   towards you, in which I have greater pleasure than I can\r\n   express, as you are to be placed at the head of a detached\r\n   squadron destined for a very important service, at no great\r\n   distance from home. I hope the Caesar will not be long in fitting\r\n   up.\r\n\r\n   Yours most truly,\r\n   ST. VINCENT.\r\n\r\n   To Rear-admiral Sir James Saumarez.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Admiralty Office, 4th June 1801.\r\n\r\n   SIR,\r\n\r\n   I have received, and communicated to my Lords Commissioners of\r\n   the Admiralty, your letter to me of the 2nd instant, acquainting\r\n   me, for their lordships' information, of your arrival in H.M.S.\r\n   Caesar, in Cawsand Bay, in pursuance of orders from Admiral\r\n   Cornwallis, a copy of which you have enclosed: and I have their\r\n   lordships' commands to signify their directions to you to use\r\n   every exertion in completing the stores and provisions of the\r\n   said ship, as also of the Spencer; and, having so done, remain\r\n   with the said ships in Cawsand Bay, in constant readiness to\r\n   proceed on service, when you shall receive their lordships'\r\n   orders for that purpose.\r\n\r\n   I am, sir, your obedient servant,\r\n   EVAN NEPEAN.\r\n\r\n   To Rear-admiral Sir James Saumarez.\r\n\r\nThe following is the reply to Earl St. Vincent's letter of the 4th\r\nJune, dated\r\n\r\n   Caesar, Cawsand Bay, 6th June.\r\n\r\n   MY LORD,\r\n\r\n   Previously to receiving the honour of your lordship's letter, I\r\n   had been informed by Earl Spencer of his Majesty's gracious\r\n   intentions; and I beg to express my sincere acknowledgments for\r\n   the part your lordship has taken in obtaining for me this mark\r\n   of the royal favour.\r\n\r\n   I am much flattered by the communication your lordship has the\r\n   goodness to make of having nominated me for the command of a\r\n   squadron to be employed on a very particular service; and I beg\r\n   your lordship will be assured of my most zealous exertions for\r\n   the promotion of every part of it. I have the honour to be, &c.\r\n\r\n   JAS. SAUMAREZ.\r\n   To the Right Hon. Earl St. Vincent, &c.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of June, Sir James received the following communication\r\nfrom the Lords of the Admiralty, which could not fail to afford him\r\nthe highest gratification.\r\n\r\n   Most secret.\r\n\r\n   By the Commissioners for executing the office of Lord High\r\n   Admiral of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, &c.\r\n\r\n   Whereas we have received information that a squadron consisting\r\n   of five Spanish ships of the line, which lately sailed from\r\n   Ferrol, have arrived at Cadiz; and that great exertions are now\r\n   making at the last-mentioned place for the equipment of a\r\n   further naval force, for the purpose (it is alleged) of an\r\n   attack upon Portugal; we send you herewith copies of the several\r\n   letters containing the information mentioned: and do hereby\r\n   direct you, on the arrival of the Hannibal, Audacious, and\r\n   Thames, at Plymouth, to take them under your command, (their\r\n   captains being directed to follow your orders,) as also the\r\n   Spencer, and either the Juste, Pompee, or Courageux, now in\r\n   Cawsand Bay, whichever may first be ready, and proceed with them\r\n   and the Caesar, with as little delay as possible, off Cadiz,\r\n   where you may expect to be joined by the Venerable and Superb,\r\n   which ships you are also to take under your command; and use\r\n   your best endeavours to prevent the enemy's ships at that port\r\n   from putting to sea, or to take or destroy them should they sail\r\n   from thence.\r\n\r\n   In the event of the enemy's squadron getting out of Cadiz\r\n   undiscovered, either before or after your arrival off that\r\n   place, you are to follow it, according to any well-grounded\r\n   intelligence you may be able to obtain of it; but you are not to\r\n   proceed in quest of it to any distant station, unless you should\r\n   receive such information as shall leave no doubt of the\r\n   certainty of the enemy's destination. If you should not be able\r\n   to obtain any information of the enemy's squadron so as to\r\n   enable you to follow it, you are in that case to repair with the\r\n   ships under your command off the Straits, and send into Tangier\r\n   and Gibraltar, and, finding that it has proceeded up the\r\n   Mediterranean, to follow it; but, not gaining any intelligence\r\n   of it, you are to resume your station off Cadiz, and remain\r\n   there until you shall receive some information whereby your\r\n   proceedings may be regulated.\r\n\r\n   And whereas it has been represented to us that three Portuguese\r\n   ships of the line are now fitting out in the Tagus for the\r\n   purpose of joining you and serving under your orders, you are,\r\n   on the arrival of the said ships, to take them under your\r\n   command, and employ them in such manner as you may judge most\r\n   advisable in carrying these, or any other orders you may receive\r\n   from us or from Admiral Lord Keith, (under whose command you are\r\n   to consider yourself,) into execution. And whereas we have\r\n   directed Admiral Sir Thomas Pasley to order one of the hired\r\n   brigs, and either a cutter or lugger, to follow your orders; you\r\n   are to take the commanders of these vessels under your command,\r\n   and, on your repairing to your station, you are to send one of\r\n   them into the Tagus for the purpose of apprizing his Majesty's\r\n   minister there of your situation, and for obtaining from him\r\n   such intelligence as he may have to give you.\r\n\r\n   Whilst you remain on this service, you are to send occasionally\r\n   to Lisbon for intelligence, and to keep a good look-out for any\r\n   French squadron which may attempt either to join the Spanish\r\n   ships at Cadiz, or to pass through the Straits; and to use your\r\n   best endeavours to intercept, and to take or destroy it, if the\r\n   force you may have with you should be sufficient to enable you\r\n   to do so; taking care to avoid it in time, if the enemy's force\r\n   should be so superior to that under your command as to render it\r\n   improper for you to attack it; in which case it is left to your\r\n   discretion to act as circumstances shall require: using,\r\n   however, every possible exertion to join the commander-in-chief\r\n   of his Majesty's ships in the Mediterranean, or to fall in with\r\n   the same detachment of his Majesty's ships; and, so soon as you\r\n   shall have collected such a force as may be sufficient to enable\r\n   you to attack the enemy's squadron, you are to proceed in quest\r\n   of it, and, upon falling in with it, to bring it to action.\r\n\r\n   In case you should get sight of a French squadron, or should\r\n   obtain certain information that such squadron has passed the\r\n   Straits, you are no longer to attend to the Spanish ships in\r\n   Cadiz, but to consider the capture or destruction of the French\r\n   squadron as the principal object to which your exertions are to\r\n   be directed; and, in the event of your following any squadron\r\n   into the Mediterranean, you are to send an account thereof to\r\n   our secretary, as well as to Admiral Lord Keith, with as little\r\n   delay as possible; and you are also to transmit to him and the\r\n   said admiral, by every proper opportunity that may offer,\r\n   accounts of your proceedings, and of every information you may\r\n   be able to obtain of the movements and intentions of the enemy.\r\n\r\n   Given under our hands, 6th day of June 1801.\r\n   ST. VINCENT.\r\n   T. TROUBRIDGE.\r\n   J. MARKHAM.\r\n\r\n   To Sir James Saumarez, Bart.\r\n   Rear-admiral of the Blue,\r\n   Plymouth.\r\n   By command of their Lordships,\r\n   EVAN NEPEAN.\r\n\r\nThe following is the copy of information transmitted to Sir James with\r\nthe above letter:\r\n\r\n   No. 1.\r\n\r\n   Dated Lisbon, 15th May 1801.\r\n\r\n   MY LORD,\r\n\r\n   It appears, from the report of an American captain arrived here\r\n   from Bilboa, that a French corps had passed within a few miles\r\n   of that place, on their way to Vittoria, on the 21st and 22nd\r\n   ultimo. It consisted in the whole of 7,000 infantry and 2,000\r\n   cavalry, well armed and mounted; and had reached their place of\r\n   encampment, supposed to be Burgos, according to the accounts\r\n   which had arrived at Bilboa, on the 30th day, when the vessel\r\n   sailed. It appeared evident that no other troops had passed the\r\n   frontier at that time, though it was uniformly reported that a\r\n   body of no less than 22,000 men were collected at Bayonne.\r\n\r\n   The Spanish army on the south side of the Tagus, between Badajos\r\n   and Alcantara, amounts to 21,000 men; of which 10,000 are\r\n   encamped at Badajos, 8,000 at Albuquerque, and the remainder\r\n   between Vincenti and Alcantara. The Prince of Peace was daily\r\n   expected at head-quarters. His aides-de-camp were already\r\n   arrived, and a train of 700 mules had been collected for the\r\n   conveyance of his baggage. The French detachment was destined to\r\n   join the army of Castile, which I already mentioned to your\r\n   lordship has returned from its movements towards the northern\r\n   provinces, and taken a position to the southward of Ciudad\r\n   Rodrigo. Its numbers and distribution are not so accurately\r\n   known, but it is stated to be equal to the army of Estremadura,\r\n   with the addition of the French auxiliaries.\r\n\r\n   I have the honour to be, &c.\r\n\r\n   To Lord Hawkesbury.\r\n   J.M. FRERE.\r\n\r\n   No. 2.\r\n\r\n   MY LORD,\r\n\r\n   By intelligence which arrived from Cadiz, in date of the second\r\n   of this month, it appears that there were in that port five\r\n   Spanish ships of the line, which had pushed out from Ferrol,\r\n   conformably to the report which I mentioned to your lordship in\r\n   my last despatch. There was at the same time (in Cadiz) an\r\n   additional force of eight or ten sail preparing for sea; four of\r\n   them of the line, and the remainder frigates. This equipment was\r\n   however retarded by the want of naval stores, particularly\r\n   sailcloth and cables, which was occasioned by the late fire\r\n   which has taken place in the arsenal, as well as by the total\r\n   want of money, which was such that many of the officers were\r\n   actually reduced to subsist on charity.\r\n\r\n   The informant, whose authority may be depended on, adds that a\r\n   squadron from Brest was expected to join them. It was supposed\r\n   that the whole armament would be directed against Portugal; and\r\n   this supposition was not weakened by a report which was given\r\n   out industriously that the object of the intended expedition was\r\n   to make a landing on the coast of Barbary, in order to force the\r\n   Emperor of Morocco to shut his ports against the English. The\r\n   ships from Ferrol have the French and Spanish colours united in\r\n   the same flag. It was understood that the ships now arming in\r\n   Cadiz were to be commanded by French officers. They were\r\n   victualled only for a very short voyage.\r\n\r\n   Respecting the danger to which this capital would be exposed by\r\n   a _coup-de-main_, which might be attempted in spite of the\r\n   batteries at the entrance of the river, as well as the\r\n   possibility of effecting a landing a few miles off Cascaes, your\r\n   lordship has at hand the means of information so much superior\r\n   to any which I could presume to offer, or collect from\r\n   professional persons here, that I shall only presume to solicit\r\n   your lordship's attention to the consideration of this subject,\r\n   and to the necessity which may arise out of it, for employing a\r\n   naval force upon this station. Don Rodrigo has informed me that\r\n   the three Portuguese ships of the line, which I mentioned to\r\n   your lordship as preparing for service, will be ready within\r\n   three weeks to form a junction with any force which his Majesty\r\n   might be pleased to detach, for the defence of Portugal; and\r\n   that two more would be prepared to follow them within a short\r\n   time after.\r\n\r\n   It appears by a letter from Viana, that the master of an English\r\n   vessel, who had been captured on the 10th ultimo by Le Telegraph\r\n   privateer, and carried into Corunna on the 23rd, had found there\r\n   two large French frigates, which had arrived immediately before\r\n   him in eight days from Cherbourg, laden with some ammunition,\r\n   and destined (as they reported) for Cadiz. The master of Le\r\n   Telegraph had avoided putting into any of his own ports from the\r\n   apprehension of being detained, as it was reported that other\r\n   privateers had been stopped, and stripped of their men, on\r\n   account of a secret expedition which was fitting out in the\r\n   French ports.\r\n\r\n   I have the honour to be, &c.\r\n   J.H. FRERE.\r\n\r\n   The Right Honourable Lord Hawkesbury, &c. &c. &c.\r\n\r\n   No. 3.\r\n\r\n   Intelligence arrived from General O'Hara, at Gibraltar.\r\n\r\n   Arrived by land the crew of the Fortune privateer, consisting of\r\n   twelve men. They report that last Saturday, between three and\r\n   four P.M. they saw two three-deckers and three seventy-fours\r\n   arrive at Cadiz from Ferrol; that the Santissima Trinidad,\r\n   another Spanish three-decker, is completed and ready in that\r\n   harbour; and that they are fitting out five other line-of-battle\r\n   ships at Cadiz, which have their lower-masts in; that, in order\r\n   to man the said ships, they are detaining all the crews of the\r\n   French privateers; that those eleven ships are to be commanded\r\n   by French officers; and they say the five ships in the Caraccas\r\n   will soon be ready,--that they observed a number of seamen\r\n   rigging them.--Gibraltar, 29th April 1801.\r\n\r\n     List of the armament fitting out at Cadiz.\r\n\r\n                          Guns.\r\n\r\n     Santissima Trinidada  140\r\n     Atlante                80\r\n     Ferrivel               80\r\n     San Antonio            80\r\n     Suberano               80\r\n     San Justo              74\r\n     San Januario           80\r\n     Intrepido              80\r\n     Firme                  80\r\n\r\n   The above ships are commanded by French officers, and probably,\r\n   therefore, are those which are alluded to as having been ceded\r\n   to France.\r\n\r\n                        Guns                          Guns\r\n   A.

In a conversation I\r\n   accidentally had with him last evening, I learned that his\r\n   ambition had been much disappointed in not being created a\r\n   baronet; and he thought I was wanting, in not pointing to this\r\n   object in the letter I had the honour to write your lordship by\r\n   him, after the battle of the Nile, where he was second in\r\n   command; and he also conceives that your lordship led him to\r\n   hope this mark of approbation of his services would have been\r\n   conferred upon him. May I therefore trespass upon your\r\n   indulgence, to request you will bring it about, if possible, as\r\n   nothing can gratify me more, than that officers, who have\r\n   signalised themselves under my auspices, should be amply\r\n   rewarded.\r\n\r\n   Yours, most faithfully,\r\n   ST. VINCENT.\r\n\r\n   To the Right Hon. Earl Spencer.\r\n\r\nA copy of the preceding having been sent by Earl St. Vincent to Sir\r\nJames, produced the following answer:--\r\n\r\n   MY LORD,\r\n\r\n   Permit me to express my sincere acknowledgments for the very\r\n   handsome letter you have done me the favour to write on a\r\n   certain subject to Lord Spencer. Whether it meets with the\r\n   expected success, or otherwise, I shall ever feel grateful for\r\n   your obliging intentions towards me: at the same time, I am\r\n   persuaded your lordship must coincide with my feelings, when I\r\n   observe that the boon now pointed out was no more than the\r\n   services I had the good fortune to be employed upon, gave me\r\n   reason to expect long before this.\r\n\r\n   That health, and every possible success may ever attend your\r\n   lordship, is the fervent wish of\r\n\r\n   My dear lord,\r\n   Your much obliged,\r\n   and faithful humble servant,\r\n\r\n   JAS. SAUMAREZ.\r\n   Caesar, 29th July 1800.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of June, his Majesty, having taken into consideration the\r\nmeritorious services of Sir James Saumarez, was pleased to create him\r\na Baronet of the United Kingdom; and, as an additional mark of the\r\nroyal favour, permission was granted under the King's sign manual to\r\nwear the supporters to the arms of his family (which had been\r\nregistered in the Heralds' office since the reign of Charles the\r\nSecond); a privilege to which no commoner is entitled without a\r\ndispensation from the Crown. Of these honours Sir James was informed\r\nby Earl St. Vincent, at that time First Lord of the Admiralty, at the\r\nmoment the Caesar and squadron were about to proceed on one of the most\r\ninteresting, and, as it turned out, one of the most glorious\r\nexpeditions that ever left the shores of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n1801.\r\n\r\n   Sir James sails from England in command of a squadron of six\r\n   sail of the line on a particular service.--Arrives off\r\n   Cadiz.--Attacks a French squadron at Algeziras.--Captain\r\n   Brenton's account of the battle.--Loss of the Hannibal.--Colonel\r\n   Connolly's statements.--Logs of the Caesar and ships of the\r\n   squadron.--Sir James proceeds to Gibraltar.--Remarks.--Flag of\r\n   truce sent to Algeziras.--Correspondence with Linois.--Squadron\r\n   refit at Gibraltar.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 16th June the signal was made to unmoor; and soon after, for\r\nthe squadron to weigh. The wind being fair, the ships quickly cleared\r\nthe English Channel, and crossed the Bay of Biscay. Cape Finisterre\r\nwas reached on the 22nd; on the 26th the squadron hove to off the\r\nTagus, and sent letters on shore at Lisbon. The detachment was now\r\njoined by the Phaeton, Captain Morris, and proceeded off Cadiz, where\r\nit arrived on the 28th June: to announce this, the following letter\r\nwas written to Admiral Lord Keith, who had then the chief command on\r\nthe Mediterranean station:\r\n\r\n   Caesar, off Cadiz, 26th June 1801.\r\n\r\n   MY LORD,\r\n\r\n   I have the honour to inform your lordship of my arrival off\r\n   Cadiz with the ships named on the margin[28] under my orders;\r\n   having sailed from Cawsand Bay on the 16th instant. On the 26th\r\n   I was joined, off Lisbon, by the Phaeton, Captain Morris, from\r\n   whom I received the enclosed state of the enemy's ships at\r\n   Cadiz.[29] The Venerable and Superb have both joined the\r\n   squadron; and I have taken these ships under my orders,\r\n   agreeably to my instructions from my Lords Commissioners of the\r\n   Admiralty.\r\n\r\n   I shall take the earliest opportunity of transmitting to your\r\n   lordship a copy of those instructions; but having at present no\r\n   other vessel than the Plymouth, hired lugger, I cannot part with\r\n   her further than to Gibraltar.\r\n\r\n   I have the honour to be,\r\n   Your lordship's most obedient humble servant,\r\n   JAS. SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n   Right Honourable Lord Keith, K.B. &c.\r\n\r\n   [28] Caesar, Pompee, Spencer, Hannibal, Audacious, Thames,\r\n   Phaeton, and Plymouth, hired lugger.\r\n\r\n   [29] See list already given.\r\n\r\nThe squadron continued to cruise off Cadiz, and frequently to\r\nreconnoitre the harbour; while the Superb was stationed off Lagos as a\r\nlook-out ship to westward, and the Thames in the Straits of Gibraltar\r\nto the eastward.\r\n\r\nNothing of importance occurred until the 5th, when intelligence was\r\nreceived as to the situation of a French squadron. Sir James\r\naccordingly despatched the Plymouth lugger with the following letters\r\nto the Secretary of the Admiralty, and to Mr. Frere, the English\r\nambassador at Lisbon:\r\n\r\n   Caesar, off Cadiz, 5th July 1801.\r\n   SIR\r\n\r\n   In my letter of the 29th ultimo, I acquainted you, for the\r\n   information of my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, of my\r\n   arrival before Cadiz with the squadron under my orders, and of\r\n   my having been joined by the Venerable and Superb.\r\n\r\n   You will please to inform their lordships, that, early this\r\n   morning, a despatch-boat joined me from Gibraltar, with\r\n   intelligence that three French line-of-battle ships and a\r\n   frigate were seen, on the 1st instant, endeavouring to pass the\r\n   Straits from the eastward; and the Plymouth lugger has since\r\n   joined me, whose commander informs me that they anchored\r\n   yesterday off Algeziras. As from the different accounts I form\r\n   great hopes of being able to attack them with success, I am\r\n   proceeding to the eastward, and I hope to reach the bay early\r\n   to-morrow morning. The ships in Cadiz are getting in forwardness\r\n   to put to sea. Eight appeared this morning with top-gallant\r\n   yards across and sails bent, and four others with their\r\n   top-masts rigged. I have directed the commander of the Plymouth,\r\n   hired lugger, after having landed this letter at Faro, to cruise\r\n   off Cape St. Mary's to apprise any of his Majesty's ships of my\r\n   rendezvous, giving them such further information as he may be\r\n   possessed of.\r\n\r\n   I am, sir, your most obedient servant,\r\n   JAMES SAUMAREZ.\r\n   Evan Nepean, Esq. &c. &c. &c. Admiralty.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Caesar, off Cadiz, 5th July 1801.\r\n\r\n   SIR,\r\n\r\n   I have the honour to acquaint you with my having this instant\r\n   received information, by an express from Gibraltar, that three\r\n   sail of French line-of-battle ships and a frigate had anchored\r\n   yesterday in Algeziras Bay, after being three days in\r\n   endeavouring to pass the Straits from the eastward. They are\r\n   supposed to be destined for Cadiz. I am proceeding off\r\n   Gibraltar, in hopes it may be practicable to attack them, or\r\n   prevent the junction of their other ships, from whom they are\r\n   said to be separated. I request you will please to forward the\r\n   letters I take the liberty to enclose herewith. I have the\r\n   honour to be, sir,\r\n\r\n   Your most obedient humble servant,\r\n   JAMES SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n   Governor O'Hara writes that he is without intelligence from\r\n   Egypt since the repulse of the French, the 21st March.\r\n\r\n   His Excellency J.H. Frere, Esq. &c. &c. &c. Lisbon.\r\n\r\nIt now becomes our duty to give a particular account of the defensive\r\nmeans of the French Admiral. The road of Algeziras, six miles distant\r\nfrom Gibraltar, is open to the eastward. It is shallow, with sunken\r\nrocks in several parts. The town is nearly in the centre, at the\r\nbottom of the Bay; about a third of a mile from which there is a tower\r\nstanding on a point, and off this point is Isla Verda, whereon is a\r\nbattery of seven long 24-pounders. About a mile to the southward of\r\nthis battery is Fort Santa Garcia. The English ships had to pass these\r\nfortifications before they could reach the French line. The northward\r\nof the town was no less protected, having at the distance of about\r\ntwo-thirds of a mile the fort of San Jago, mounting five long\r\n18-pounders, besides the tower Almirante. By referring to the\r\ndiagrams, it will be manifest that the road is admirably protected by\r\nthese fortifications, while those at a greater distance to the\r\nnorthward would be of some service in throwing shells, and in\r\npreventing the ships from working up to the attack. There were also\r\nfourteen large gun-boats, whose positions, as shown, were such as to\r\nform a serious opposition to an approaching enemy in light and\r\nvariable winds.\r\n\r\nBefore we proceed to a description of the attack on the enemy's\r\nwell-protected squadron, we must intreat the reader to pause, while we\r\ncall his attention to the circumstance of the British ships, led by\r\nthe gallant Hood, slowly and silently approaching the batteries of an\r\nenemy, strongly reinforced, perfectly prepared to receive them, and\r\nknowing well that they could not suffer any injury from the ships,\r\nwhile every shot from their cannon must tell. Silence, undoubtedly\r\nderives importance from the circumstances under which it is observed,\r\nand we cannot well refer to an instance where silence could have had a\r\nmore solemn and impressive character than that which must have been\r\nobserved on this occasion, until broken by the roar of the enemy's\r\ndestructive engines.\r\n\r\nCaptain (now Admiral Sir Jahleel) Brenton, who was flag-captain of the\r\nCaesar, has kindly transmitted the following particular and authentic\r\naccount of all that took place on that eventful day, which afforded\r\nthe enemy a short-lived triumph. We shall make no apology for giving\r\nit in his own words:\r\n\r\n   On Sunday, the 5th July 1801, a despatch-boat was seen in the\r\n   S.E., and at two P.M. came alongside the Caesar, with\r\n   intelligence of a French squadron having anchored in Algeziras\r\n   Bay, consisting of three sail of the line and a frigate.[30] The\r\n   Admiral immediately decided on attacking them; and ordered the\r\n   Thames frigate to proceed off St. Lucar to recall the Superb,\r\n   and make sail with the Pompee, Hannibal, Spencer, Audacious, and\r\n   Venerable, for the entrance of the Straits of Gibraltar; making\r\n   the signal to prepare for action, and for anchoring by the\r\n   stern.\r\n\r\n     [30] Le Formidable, 84. Dessaix, 84. Indomptable, 74: and\r\n     Meuron, 38.\r\n\r\n   The day was beautiful, with a light air from the westward. At\r\n   eleven o'clock the ship's company was, as usual, assembled for\r\n   the purpose of Divine service. The appearance of this\r\n   congregation, under the peculiar circumstances in which they\r\n   were placed,--proceeding, as they all knew they were, to engage\r\n   in battle with the enemy, with the probability that many had but\r\n   a few remaining hours to live,--was solemn and deeply\r\n   impressive. The crew were all dressed in white, as is customary\r\n   in warm climates; and being arranged according to their\r\n   respective divisions on the quarter-deck, with the band and the\r\n   marines on the poop, and the Admiral and the officers under the\r\n   poop awning, an effect was produced highly animating, solemn,\r\n   and appropriate; while the meek, devotional countenance of the\r\n   well-tried Admiral indicated that he derived his confidence and\r\n   support from its only true source.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Our chaplain, the Rev. Mr. Holliday, gave an excellent\r\n   discourse, appropriate to the occasion; and it cannot be doubted\r\n   but the impressions it made on that eventful day were deep and\r\n   affecting, however temporary.\r\n\r\n   I had of course much communication with the Admiral during the\r\n   course of this day and the ensuing night. He was, as usual,\r\n   calm, cheerful, and collected; foreseeing, and endeavouring to\r\n   provide for, whatever might be required during the struggle\r\n   which we were anticipating. He was quite aware of the\r\n   difficulties we had to encounter, and fully determined to\r\n   overcome them if possible.[31]\r\n\r\n     [31] The following memorandum was communicated to the squadron\r\n     before bearing up for Gibraltar Bay:\r\n\r\n     Memorandum\r\n\r\n     Caesar, 5th July 1801.\r\n\r\n     If the Rear-admiral finds the enemy's ships in a situation to be\r\n     attacked, the following is the order in which it is to be\r\n     executed:\r\n\r\n     The Venerable to lead into the bay, and pass the enemy's ships\r\n     without anchoring;\r\n\r\n     The Pompee to anchor abreast of the inner ship of the enemy's\r\n     line;\r\n\r\n       The Audacious, }\r\n        \"  Caesar,     }  to anchor abreast of the enemy's ships\r\n        \"  Spencer,   }     and batteries;\r\n        \"  Hannibal,  }\r\n\r\n                      {  to keep under sail, and annoy the enemy's\r\n        \"  Superb,    {     batteries and gun-boats during the attack\r\n        \"  Thames,    {     assisted by the Plymouth lugger.\r\n\r\n     The boats of the different ships to be lowered down and armed,\r\n     in readiness to act where required.\r\n\r\n     Given on board the Caesar, off Tariffa,\r\n     5th July 1801.\r\n     JAMES SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n   To the respective Captains.\r\n\r\n   At daylight we were off Tariffa, with light airs from the\r\n   westward, which at seven freshened to a strong breeze, and\r\n   enabled the Venerable to open the Bay of Algeziras, in which the\r\n   French squadron were discovered at anchor. On the Venerable\r\n   making the signal that she could weather the enemy, the Admiral\r\n   made another to take stations for mutual support. The Pompee,\r\n   Venerable, and Audacious were soon at an anchor, and at\r\n   thirty-five minutes after eight began the action with the enemy.\r\n   The Caesar at nine o'clock opened her fire, and at fifteen\r\n   minutes past nine came to an anchor ahead of the Venerable. The\r\n   Spencer and Hannibal passed under our lee, nearly becalmed, and\r\n   anchored without the Caesar, firing, as the smoke subsided,\r\n   through the openings between our ships at the enemy.\r\n\r\n   About ten o'clock the fire of the French ships appeared to\r\n   slacken so much that I ventured to suggest to the Admiral that a\r\n   flag of truce might be sent in, with a notice to the Spaniards\r\n   that if the British squadron were permitted to take away the\r\n   French ships without any further molestation from the batteries,\r\n   the town would be respected, and no further injury done to it.\r\n\r\n   The Admiral expressed his readiness to do this; but considered\r\n   the advantage we had gained, as yet, not sufficiently decisive\r\n   to justify such a measure. And his judgment was but too correct.\r\n   The decrease of the fire from the French ships arose from their\r\n   being occupied in warping close in-shore; and, shortly after\r\n   this period, the Pompee having broken her sheer, lost her\r\n   commanding position relative to the French Admiral, whom she had\r\n   been raking with great effect, and now became raked in her turn.\r\n   At twenty minutes after ten, the boats of the squadron were sent\r\n   to her assistance, and, having cut her cables, she was towed out\r\n   of her exposed situation.\r\n\r\n   At thirty-five minutes after ten, the Admiral, observing how\r\n   much the enemy had increased their distance from us by warping\r\n   in-shore, ordered our cables to be cut, and sail to be made upon\r\n   the ships, in the hope of being able to close with them. He also\r\n   sent me on board the Spencer, with orders to Captain Darby to\r\n   weigh, and work up to the enemy. The Hannibal, having already\r\n   received these orders, was in the act of obeying them, and soon\r\n   after opened her fire upon the French Admiral; but in the\r\n   gallant endeavour to get between the Formidable and the shore,\r\n   and not being aware of the French Admiral's change of position\r\n   by warping in, Captain Ferris unfortunately ran his ship\r\n   aground, abreast of the battery of St. Jago, and under the\r\n   raking fire of the Formidable. In this helpless state he\r\n   continued to engage the enemy until, to use the French Admiral's\r\n   words, his decks were _jonche de morts_. He had seventy-three\r\n   killed and sixty-four wounded,--a very unusual proportion, as,\r\n   in general, the wounded trebles the number of the killed; but\r\n   this may be accounted for by the Hannibal being so near that the\r\n   enemy's shot passed through her sides without making any\r\n   splinters, to which the greater number of wounds are\r\n   attributable.\r\n\r\n   From the time the Caesar cut her cable, she and the Audacious\r\n   were constantly engaged with the Indomptable, Meuron, and island\r\n   batteries, and occasionally with the Dessaix, as they could\r\n   bring their guns-to bear; but the perpetual flaws of wind\r\n   rendered this very difficult, and exposed them frequently to a\r\n   severe and raking fire from the enemy. The Admiral made the\r\n   signal for the marines to be prepared to land on the island;\r\n   but, as the boats were all employed in assisting the Pompee and\r\n   Hannibal, this was rendered impracticable. At length, finding\r\n   every effort fruitless to close with the enemy, the Admiral was\r\n   under the necessity of withdrawing his ships from this unequal\r\n   contest with winds and batteries; but it was not until all hope\r\n   had vanished of saving the Hannibal that he left her in\r\n   possession of the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying diagram shows first, the position of the hostile\r\nsquadrons at the moment the Spencer, and Venerable, and Caesar, had\r\nanchored; secondly, their position when the action ceased, and when\r\nthe Hannibal was in possession of the enemy.\r\n\r\n   The action of Algeziras was certainly obstinately fought, and\r\n   gallantly contested on both sides. It is true that the French\r\n   had little to do but to attend to their guns, being either at an\r\n   anchor in their strong position, or warping towards the shore.\r\n   In this operation the Spaniards had the hardest duty, being\r\n   employed in their boats in carrying out hawsers, and even in\r\n   heaving them in. Success seemed certain to the British squadron\r\n   till the Pompee broke her sheer; after that, it was one\r\n   continued but unavailing struggle to recover the ground we had\r\n   lost by this misfortune: and we retreated to Gibraltar when all\r\n   hope was at an end, the Admiral justly considering the\r\n   importance of repairing the damages already sustained, and of\r\n   preserving the lives of his gallant crew, which would be\r\n   uselessly sacrificed by a continuance of a hopeless contest.\r\n\r\n   Never did I contemplate more real greatness of mind than was\r\n   displayed on this occasion by our heroic chief. The calmness and\r\n   cheerfulness with which he met and sustained the sad reverses of\r\n   this most trying day, were objects worthy of remark and\r\n   admiration. Whilst going into the Bay of Algeziras, he desired\r\n   me to look over my signal-book, and to mark such signals as\r\n   might be likely to be called for. He had already done the same,\r\n   and when, during the heat of the action, any of the flags were\r\n   destroyed, or the halliards shot away, I was astonished at the\r\n   readiness with which he ordered one signal to be substituted for\r\n   another, according as the signification might answer the\r\n   purpose, without any reference to the book.\r\n\r\n   On reaching our anchorage off the Mole of Gibraltar, after\r\n   giving the necessary orders for the disposal and refitting of\r\n   his squadron, he returned to his cabin with a deep sense of the\r\n   responsibility he had incurred; but supported by the unqualified\r\n   conviction that every exertion had been made to obtain success,\r\n   and that the disappointment resulted from circumstances over\r\n   which he had no control.\r\n\r\n   The action terminated, as appears by the log, at thirty-five\r\n   minutes after one; and the squadron proceeded to Gibraltar. As\r\n   soon as the ship was secured, the Admiral sent me on shore to\r\n   the governor, to relate to him the events of the two preceding\r\n   days. I found him sitting in his balcony, which commanded a view\r\n   of the Bay and Algeziras, evidently deeply affected by the\r\n   unlooked-for termination of an attack upon the French squadron,\r\n   and anxiously reflecting on the probable results.\r\n\r\n   On my return on board, the Admiral had retired to his cot; and I\r\n   had no means of communicating with him until next morning. I\r\n   could then, however, perceive that under all the severity of\r\n   disappointment he experienced from our failure, and the loss of\r\n   the Hannibal, he felt that no honour had been lost; that every\r\n   effort had been made to obtain success; and that he derived\r\n   comfort from the sanguine hopes he entertained that an\r\n   opportunity might present itself in which he should be able to\r\n   retrieve the loss.\r\n\r\n   He ordered me to take a flag of truce and wait upon the French\r\n   Admiral, and propose an exchange of prisoners; which M. Linois\r\n   refused, alleging that it was not in his power to establish a\r\n   cartel for the purpose until he obtained the sanction of the\r\n   Minister of the Marine at Paris, to whom he had sent off an\r\n   express as soon as the firing had ceased on the preceding day;\r\n   but he consented to send over the officers on parole. The object\r\n   of the French Admiral was very obvious. He concluded we wanted\r\n   the men to replace those that had been killed and wounded; but\r\n   he thought, justly, that sending over officers on parole would\r\n   be a harmless act of courtesy, from which we could reap no\r\n   immediate benefit. It will be seen that, subsequently to the\r\n   second action, (only six days after the first,) when his\r\n   despatches from Algeziras had scarcely reached Paris, he did not\r\n   wait for an answer from the Minister of the Marine: but\r\n   circumstances had altered. We had taken a line-of-battle ship,\r\n   and burned two first-rates; and he now wished to get as many of\r\n   the crew back as possible.\r\n\r\nWe shall now transcribe the Rear-admiral's official account of the\r\nbattle: this affords additional particulars, and proves that every\r\nstep had been taken to insure success; which, but from circumstances\r\nthat often blight the fairest prospects, would have had a very\r\ndifferent result. We shall venture to add, that, had the gallant\r\nAdmiral hesitated to make the attempt, he would have rendered himself\r\nobnoxious to animadversions, not only from all the squadron under his\r\ncommand, but from every one on the Rock of Gibraltar who witnessed the\r\nenemy's squadron of inferior force setting, as it were, that of Sir\r\nJames at defiance; while it would have afforded the French and\r\nSpaniards a just, or, at least a plausible subject of exultation. But\r\nSir James, with that decision of character and coolness, when in the\r\npresence of an enemy, for which he was always remarkable, did not\r\nhesitate one moment on the attack, which was made with consummate\r\nskill, and maintained with a perseverance never surpassed.\r\n\r\n   Caesar, Gibraltar, 6th July 1801.\r\n\r\n   SIR,\r\n\r\n   I have to request you will be pleased to inform my Lords\r\n   Commissioners of the Admiralty that, conformable to my letter of\r\n   yesterday's date, I stood through the Straits, with his\r\n   Majesty's squadron under my orders, with the intention of\r\n   attacking three French line-of-battle ships and a frigate that I\r\n   was informed were at anchor off Algeziras. On opening Cabrita\r\n   Point, I found the ships lay at a considerable distance from the\r\n   enemy's batteries; and having a leading wind up to them, every\r\n   reasonable hope of success in the attack was afforded.\r\n\r\n   I had previously directed Captain Hood in the Venerable, from\r\n   his experience and knowledge of the anchorage, to lead the\r\n   squadron, which he executed with his accustomed gallantry; and,\r\n   although it was not intended he should anchor, he found himself\r\n   under the necessity of so doing, from the wind failing,--a\r\n   circumstance so much to be apprehended in this country, and to\r\n   which I have to attribute the want of success in this\r\n   well-intended enterprise. Captain Stirling anchored, conformably\r\n   to the enclosed order of attack, opposite to the inner ship of\r\n   the enemy, and brought the Pompee to action in the most\r\n   spirited and gallant manner; an example which was followed by\r\n   the commanders of every ship in the squadron.\r\n\r\n   Captains Darby and Ferris, owing to light winds, were prevented\r\n   for a considerable time from coming into action. At length, the\r\n   Hannibal getting a breeze, Captain Ferris had the most\r\n   favourable prospect of being alongside one of the enemy's ships,\r\n   when the Hannibal unfortunately took the ground; and I am\r\n   extremely concerned to acquaint their lordships that, after\r\n   having made every possible effort with this ship and the\r\n   Audacious to rescue her from the enemy, I was under the\r\n   necessity to make sail, being at the time only three cables'\r\n   length from one of the enemy's batteries.\r\n\r\n   My thanks are particularly due to all the captains and men under\r\n   my orders; and, although their endeavours have not been crowned\r\n   with success, I trust the thousands of spectators from his\r\n   Majesty's garrison, and also the surrounding coast, will do\r\n   justice to their valour and intrepidity, which were not to be\r\n   checked by the fire from the numerous batteries (however\r\n   formidable) that surrounded Algeziras.\r\n\r\n   I feel it incumbent upon me to state to their lordships the\r\n   great merits of Captain Brenton of the Caesar, whose cool\r\n   judgment and intrepid conduct, I will venture to pronounce, were\r\n   never surpassed. I also beg leave to recommend to their\r\n   lordships' notice my flag-lieutenant, Mr. Philip Dumaresq, who\r\n   has served with me from the commencement of this war, and is a\r\n   most deserving officer. Mr. Lamborn and the other lieutenants\r\n   are also entitled to great praise; as well as Captain Maxwell of\r\n   the Marines, and the other officers of his corps serving on\r\n   board the Caesar.\r\n\r\n   The enemy's ships consisted of two of eighty-four guns and one\r\n   of seventy-four, with a large frigate: two of the former are\r\n   aground, and the whole are rendered totally unserviceable.\r\n\r\n   His Majesty's ships have suffered considerably in their masts\r\n   and rigging; but I hope will soon be refitted, and in readiness\r\n   to proceed on service.\r\n\r\n   Inclosed is the return of the killed and wounded from the\r\n   different ships of the squadron. Amongst other valuable men I\r\n   have most sincerely to lament the loss of Mr. William Grave,\r\n   master of the Caesar. I cannot close this letter without\r\n   rendering the most ample justice to the great bravery of Captain\r\n   Ferris: the loss in his ship must have been very considerable\r\n   both in officers and men; but I have the satisfaction to be\r\n   informed that his Majesty has not lost so valuable an officer.\r\n\r\n   The Honourable Captain Dundas, of his Majesty's sloop the Calpe,\r\n   made his vessel as useful as possible, and kept up a spirited\r\n   fire on one of the enemy's batteries. I have also to express my\r\n   approbation of Lieutenant Janvrin, commander of the gun-boats;\r\n   who, having joined me with intelligence, served as volunteer on\r\n   board the Caesar.\r\n\r\n   I am,\r\n   Your most obedient servant,\r\n   JAS. SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n   To Evan Nepean, Esq. &c. &c. &c.\r\n\r\nOn the return of the squadron to the Mole of Gibraltar, the following\r\npublic order was issued by the Admiral.\r\n\r\n   Caesar, in Rosia Bay, 6th July 1801.\r\n\r\n   Rear-admiral Sir James Saumarez desires to express in the\r\n   strongest terms the high sense he entertains of the gallantry\r\n   and valiant conduct of all the captains, officers, and men\r\n   belonging to the squadron under his orders, in the attack made\r\n   this day on the enemy's ships and batteries; and, although the\r\n   result has not proved so successful as his expectations had\r\n   framed, he trusts that the glory they have acquired on this\r\n   occasion will ever be acknowledged by their country.\r\n\r\n   JAS. SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n   To the respective Captains.\r\n\r\nThe following addition to Sir James's despatch gives the account of\r\nthe capture of the Hannibal, from Captain Ferris, then a prisoner at\r\nAlgeziras.\r\n\r\n   Caesar, Gibraltar, 9th july 1801.\r\n\r\n   SIR,\r\n\r\n   I herewith enclose a letter from Captain Ferris of his Majesty's\r\n   late ship Hannibal, which I request you will please to lay\r\n   before their lordships; and I have only to express my deep\r\n   regret that his well-meant endeavours to bring his ship to close\r\n   action should have occasioned so severe a loss. I have the\r\n   honour to be, sir,\r\n\r\n   Your most obedient servant,\r\n   JAS. SAUMAREZ.\r\n   Evan Nepean, Esq. Admiralty.\r\n\r\n   Algeziras Bay, 7th July 1801.\r\n\r\n   SIR,\r\n\r\n   I have little more to tell you of the fate of his Majesty's ship\r\n   Hannibal than yourself must have observed; only, that from the\r\n   number of batteries, and ships' gun-boats, &c. we had to\r\n   encounter, our guns soon got knocked up; and I found it was\r\n   impossible to do anything, either for the preservation of the\r\n   ship, or for the good of the service. Our boats, sails, rigging,\r\n   and springs being all shot away, and having so many killed and\r\n   wounded, as will appear by the annexed list, I thought it\r\n   prudent to strike, and thereby preserve the lives of the brave\r\n   men that remained.\r\n\r\n   Had I been successful in the view before me previously to the\r\n   ship taking the ground, my praises of the conduct of my officers\r\n   and ship's company could not have exceeded their merits; but I\r\n   have, notwithstanding, the satisfaction to say, that every order\r\n   was obeyed and carried into execution with that promptitude and\r\n   alacrity becoming British officers and seamen.\r\n\r\n   I am, sir,\r\n   Your most obedient humble servant,\r\n   S. FERRIS.\r\n\r\n   To Rear-admiral Sir James Saumarez.\r\n\r\nIt has now become necessary that we should notice a controversy which\r\nhas taken place between the authors of the different naval histories\r\non the subject of the Battle of Algeziras; and we have been led to\r\nmake minute inquiries, first, into the cause of the discrepancies of\r\nthe different accounts; and, secondly, into the truth, which we have\r\nbeen the better able to do from our personal knowledge and recent\r\ncommunication with some of the officers of the Hannibal and Caesar, on\r\nwhose veracity we can depend. We are happy to add that the result of\r\nour inquiries has been satisfactory, and, we trust, will completely\r\nclear up and reconcile the facts, while it will leave no reflection of\r\na dubious character on the conduct of the heroic commander of the\r\nsquadron.\r\n\r\nIt appears that no difference of opinion arose on this subject until\r\nthe court-martial of Captain Ferris, which took place on the 1st\r\nSeptember 1801, at Portsmouth, Rear-admiral Holloway president; when,\r\nas usual on trials for the loss of a ship, Captain Ferris read his\r\nnarrative, which he begins thus:\r\n\r\n\"In giving a detail of the circumstances which led to the loss of his\r\nMajesty's late ship Hannibal, I am sorry that, owing to my clerk being\r\nkilled, whose remarks were lost,[32] I cannot be so particular as to\r\nthe exact times of signals being made as I otherwise should have been;\r\nbut I shall state them to you to the best of my recollection.\"\r\n\r\n   [32] The captain's clerk is stationed in action to take minutes\r\n   of the events as they occur.\r\n\r\nAfter this admission, is it not surprising that the controversy should\r\nbe mainly founded on the time at which the Hannibal struck her\r\ncolours? Captain Ferris says, \"about two o'clock;\" while by the log of\r\nthe Caesar the action had entirely ceased at thirty-five minutes past\r\none. It may be asked, why did not the court, which must have seen the\r\ndiscrepancy between his narrative and the public and other documents\r\nbefore it, inquire into the truth by requiring the evidence of the\r\nofficers and crew, none of whom were examined as to the time the ship\r\nstruck: but the duty of the court being confined to the trial of\r\nCaptain Ferris, his officers and crew, and it being (whether\r\nsupported or not) evident and notorious that they had defended their\r\nship to the last extremity, they had (unluckily for Sir James) nothing\r\nto do but to pronounce an honourable acquittal.\r\n\r\nThe next contradiction which appears, relates to the boats which were\r\nsent to the assistance of the Hannibal. Captain Ferris says, \"The\r\nAdmiral, having previously made my signal of recall, sent a boat from\r\nthe Caesar, and another from the Venerable, to my assistance; but,\r\nfinding they could afford me none, I sent the Venerable's boat back,\r\nand the crew of the Caesar in one of my own cutters, their pinnace\r\nhaving been sunk by a shot alongside.\"\r\n\r\nI am bound to say that this assertion is not borne out either by the\r\ntestimony of those who were in the boats of the Caesar and the\r\nVenerable, or by the officers of the Hannibal; because, as will be\r\nseen hereafter, these boats never reached the Hannibal, when aground,\r\nuntil after she had struck her colours.\r\n\r\nCaptain Ferris next relates that \"About twelve o'clock our ships were\r\nall out of gun-shot of the enemy, and we had the fire of the whole\r\nFrench squadron, batteries, and gun-boats, to contend with alone;\r\nagainst which we continued to keep up as brisk a fire as could be\r\nexpected, even by men in the most sanguine anticipation of victory,\r\nuntil near two o'clock.\"\r\n\r\nNow this is quite impossible, as, by the log of every ship, the\r\nsquadron was engaging much later: by the Caesar, until 1h. 35m.; by the\r\nAudacious, until 1h. 20m.; by the Venerable, until 1h. 30m. &c.;\r\nbefore which, the ensign of the Hannibal was seen, from every ship,\r\n_Union down_.\r\n\r\nIt has been unwarrantably alleged by some that the Hannibal hauled the\r\nensign down, and then hoisted it reversed, as a signal of distress,\r\nand afterwards, when she struck, hauled it down; and that the French\r\nhoisted it union down to decoy the Calpe. But, for the refutation of\r\nthese absurdities, we must refer the reader to the testimony of\r\nColonel Connolly, who was then acting captain of the marines, an\r\nofficer of the highest character, whose veracity cannot be questioned;\r\nand who, moreover, from being the only officer on the poop when the\r\ncolours were struck, had a better opportunity of knowing the facts\r\nthan any other. The following are the questions which we put to\r\nColonel Connolly, with his answers, given verbatim:\r\n\r\n   Did the enemy take possession of the Hannibal before the colours\r\n   were hoisted union down?\r\n\r\n   The colours were hauled down by Captain Ferris's orders, and\r\n   remained so; but, being so near the Formidable, the captain of\r\n   her was on board of us in two minutes after we had struck, and\r\n   the colours were hoisted _union downwards_ by the Frenchmen.[33]\r\n\r\n     [33] When the French happen to take one of our men-of-war,\r\n     they do not, as we would do, hoist their own colours over\r\n     their opponents', but hoist the English ensign union\r\n     downwards. It so seldom happened that an English man-of-war\r\n     was taken by the French, that this circumstance was known to\r\n     very few in the navy, and consequently, the ensign reversed\r\n     was known only as the signal of distress used by\r\n     merchant-ships.\r\n\r\n   Were the colours hoisted union down by the enemy; or, at any\r\n   time, by Captain Ferris's orders?\r\n\r\n   By the enemy.\r\n\r\n   Did the boats come _before_ or _after_ the colours were hoisted\r\n   union downwards, to render her assistance?\r\n\r\n   The boats from our ships did not get near us till after we were\r\n   in possession of the enemy; and I called to an old shipmate of\r\n   mine in the Venerable's barge, and told him so, as he came under\r\n   the starboard quarter; but he persisted in coming on board, and\r\n   was taken.\r\n\r\n   What boats were taken; and what boats escaped?\r\n\r\n   A good many were taken. The Venerable's barge and her first\r\n   lieutenant; and another lieutenant, in the Caesar's boat, of some\r\n   ship lying at Gibraltar; beside the mids. I am not aware indeed\r\n   that any escaped.\r\n\r\n   What French officer took possession of the Hannibal?\r\n\r\n   I am not quite certain whether it was the captain of the\r\n   Formidable or the Dessaix; they were both very close to us:\r\n   however, he was a very little fellow.\r\n\r\n   To what prison were you taken?\r\n\r\n   The ship's company were divided into two prisons, which appeared\r\n   to have been stables. There was no water in one of them, and the\r\n   distress of our poor fellows, on that account, was truly\r\n   shocking: often, when they would give money to the people\r\n   outside to bring them some to drink, they would walk off with\r\n   it, and never bring the water.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion Colonel Connolly recognised a French officer who had\r\nbeen a short time previously a prisoner on board the Warrior, to whom\r\nhe had been particularly civil, supplying him with linen, &c.; and who\r\nleft the ship with protestations of his desire to make every return in\r\nhis power, if the \"fortune of war\" should give him an opportunity: but\r\nwhen he claimed the performance of his promise, his reply was,\r\n\"Monsieur de Connolly, I very sorry for your misfortune; but I wish\r\nyou good morning!\" and left him with a sarcastic sneer.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, from this testimony, that the colours were only struck\r\nonce, and hoisted once union down, and only hoisted union down by the\r\nFrenchmen; and that the boats of the Caesar and Venerable were only\r\nonce on board the Hannibal after she was aground; namely, when their\r\ncrews were taken prisoners. But both these boats were actually sent to\r\nher assistance at a previous period, when the Hannibal was directed by\r\nthe Admiral to endeavour to obtain a position to rake the Formidable;\r\nand it was then that they were sent back. Captain Brenton first\r\nreceived the report of the Hannibal having her colours union downwards\r\nbetween twelve and one, while the Caesar was engaging the island\r\nbattery, and the Dessaix and the Muiron.\r\n\r\nThe Caesar's boat was sent with others to the assistance of the\r\nHannibal, according to the log, at seventeen minutes past one, and\r\nmust have reached her certainly before the action ceased, and found\r\nher in the hands of the enemy, as described by Colonel Connolly.\r\n\r\nIt is absurd to suppose that, while actually engaging the enemy,\r\nCaptain Ferris would haul down his colours, to hoist them as a signal\r\nof distress, when he had other ensigns to hoist, and when there was a\r\nsignal in the book, \"In distress, and in want of immediate\r\nassistance:\" this is a circumstance which, I will venture to assert,\r\nnever occurred in any naval action.\r\n\r\nCaptain Brenton, being decidedly of the same opinion, adds, \"I can\r\nonly say, when it was reported to me, _while in action_, that the\r\nHannibal's colours were reversed, I considered her to be in possession\r\nof the enemy: that the Admiral took the same view of the subject, I\r\nhave not the least doubt; and I think nothing would have induced him\r\nto abandon the Hannibal while she was engaged. I will further add,\r\nthat I never remember the slightest doubt being expressed of the\r\nHannibal having struck before the action terminated, until I read the\r\nnarrative of Captain Ferris, at his court-martial, some time\r\nafterwards.\"\r\n\r\nThe moment these champions of \"liberte, egalite, et la mort,\" entered\r\nthe Hannibal, plunder was the order of the day; and, in their furious\r\nhaste to get at the officers' trunks, they cruelly trod over the\r\nwounded in the cockpit and cable-tiers. Colonel Connolly relates that\r\nin a few minutes one of them had taken his new cocked-hat, and\r\nappeared on deck with it. He himself had given up seeking his desk,\r\nwhich contained a considerable sum of money besides valuable papers,\r\nbecause he could not get at it without creeping over the wounded; but\r\nthe French, not so particular, soon found it.\r\n\r\nWe shall now give the extracts of the various logs to which we have\r\nhad access. These have never yet been published, and we trust they\r\nwill set the matter at rest. It is some satisfaction indeed, that all\r\nauthors agree in declaring that nothing more could have been done, and\r\nthat the honour of the British flag was to the last gloriously\r\nmaintained on the 6th of July 1801.\r\n\r\nExtract of the Caesar's log in the Battle of Algeziras, 5th July:\r\n\r\n   Winds S.W. and variable. At 12h. 30m. P.M. up mainsail and in\r\n   royals; at 2h. made the signal for the squadron to prepare for\r\n   battle, and, anchoring, bent the sheet cable through the\r\n   larboard gun-room port to the sheet anchor; at 4h. set\r\n   steering-sails,--fresh breezes and fair; at 8h. moderate\r\n   breezes,--Cape Moulinau E.N.E. seven or eight miles; at 12h.\r\n   (midnight), light airs inclinable to calm,--squadron in company,\r\n   Venerable S.S.E. one mile. At 12h. 30m. (6th), in\r\n   steering-sails, and at 12h. 40m. lowered down the yawl; at 3h.\r\n   45m. a breeze sprung up,--made the signal for attention; at 4h.\r\n   5m. beat to quarters,--Cabrita Point, S.E. by E. three or four\r\n   leagues,--made the Pompee's signal to close; at 5h. set\r\n   top-gallant steering-sails, and at 6h. the fore-top-mast\r\n   steering-sail; at 7h. 45m. made the Venerable's signal to haul\r\n   the wind,--took in the starboard steering-sails; at 8h. in\r\n   steering-sails; at 8h. 5m. in top-gallant sails,--made the\r\n   signal for being at liberty to engage the enemy in passing; at\r\n   8h. do. to take stations for mutual support; at 8h. 25m. set\r\n   top-gallant sails,--the enemy's ships opened their fire,--saw\r\n   the Venerable break round off,--Caesar fired at a Spanish battery\r\n   in passing; at 8h. 35m. the action commenced with the Pompee,\r\n   Venerable, and Audacious; at 8h. 45m. made the signal for the\r\n   ships astern to make more sail; at 9h. light breezes, and\r\n   variable,--opened our fire, and the engagement became general;\r\n   at 9h. 15m. passed the Venerable, and came to with the\r\n   sheet-anchor in nine fathoms,--the sheet-cable became\r\n   _taut_,--let go the best bower to steady the ship,--Spencer and\r\n   Hannibal passed under our lee,--hailed them to get the boats\r\n   ahead, and tow into action,--light airs; at 9h. 35m. the Spencer\r\n   opened her fire; at 9h. 40m. the Hannibal, do.--our spanker-boom\r\n   shot away; at 10h. 20m. sent boats to the Pompee and Hannibal;\r\n   at 10h. 26m. made the Hannibal's signal to tack,--saw the Pompee\r\n   had broke her sheer, apparently by a flaw of wind, and was raked\r\n   by the French Admiral; at 10h. 30m. made the Pompee's signal to\r\n   cut or slip; at 10h. 35m., a breeze springing up from the N.W.,\r\n   cut our cable, wore, and made sail, engaging the enemy's ships\r\n   while passing them; at 10h. 50m. the Hannibal opened her fire on\r\n   the French Admiral; at 10h. 52m. made the signal for the\r\n   squadron to come to,--the wind on the starboard tack; at 11h.\r\n   5m. made the signal for the boats to tow the Pompee,--Caesar\r\n   engaging the southernmost ships,--Audacious, ditto,--Caesar\r\n   opened her fire on the island battery,--Audacious and Caesar\r\n   becalmed near the island reef,--boats employed towing the ship's\r\n   head round; afternoon,--light winds and variable\r\n   weather,--engaging the enemy; at 12h. 33m. made the signal for\r\n   the Hannibal being aground,--employed engaging the southernmost\r\n   ship; at 1h. 17m. Audacious wore,--made the signal for\r\n   armed-boats to proceed as denoted; at 1h. 35m. the action\r\n   ceased,--found the main-mast shot through in five places, (and\r\n   other damage which need not be mentioned,) nine men killed,\r\n   twenty-five wounded, and seven missing; at 5h. came-to at\r\n   Gibraltar, with the small bower employed warping alongside of\r\n   the sheer hulk.\r\n\r\nThe Venerable's log, which we have examined at the depot at Deptford,\r\nand which is signed by Captain Hood, fully corroborates the above,\r\nwith the addition,--\"At 12h. 40m. sent the first lieutenant in the\r\npinnace to assist the Hannibal;\" and this officer (Lieutenant Collis)\r\nin his own journal mentions the same fact. When he arrived at the\r\nHannibal, she was in possession of the enemy; and he was taken\r\nprisoner, with his boat's crew, by persisting to go on board after he\r\nwas warned by Lieutenant (now Colonel) Connolly, of the Marines. He\r\nsays it was in consequence of the ensign being reversed that the boats\r\nwere sent; and, before any of the boats reached her, she was in\r\npossession of the French, who hoisted the colours union downwards\r\nthemselves, and that they never were hoisted in that manner at any\r\nother time.\r\n\r\nThese facts are also corroborated by the logs and journals of the\r\nAudacious and Spencer, which will be given in the next chapter. Every\r\nship, indeed, mentions the impossibility of affording any assistance\r\nto the Hannibal, and that the signal was not made to leave off action\r\nuntil her situation was utterly hopeless.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the well-protected road of Algeziras being fully\r\nmanifest in the diagram facing the 346th page, it is unnecessary to\r\npoint out the difficulties the squadron had to contend with from the\r\nfive strong batteries, which were served with much effect by the\r\nFrench artillerymen. The numerous gun-boats stationed at Algeziras for\r\nthe annoyance of our commerce, were from their constant practice in\r\nthat kind of warfare, of themselves a most formidable enemy; besides,\r\nthe assistance they afforded in warping their ships in-shore, and\r\nplacing them in such a position as to enable the different batteries\r\nto support them. But the failure of the attack must be mainly\r\nattributed to the unsteadiness and faintness of the wind, which\r\nenabled none of the squadron to obtain the position it wished; that\r\nis, in-shore of the enemy: while, by falling calm at a moment the most\r\ndisadvantageous, it left the ships exposed to the enemy's fire without\r\nthe possibility of returning it.\r\n\r\nThe loss sustained by each ship was severe. The Caesar had her master,\r\nMr. William Grave, six seamen, and two marines, killed; her boatswain,\r\nG.W. Forster, seventeen seamen, one boy, and six marines, wounded;\r\nbesides the capture of Lieutenant Janvarin, a volunteer, Mr. Richard\r\nBest, and seven seamen, who were taken by boarding the Hannibal when\r\nin possession of the enemy. Her masts, particularly the main-mast, and\r\nyards, were very much injured; her boats were all cut to pieces,\r\nbesides that taken at the Hannibal; and there were many shots in her\r\nhull. The Pompee had Mr. P. Roxborough, master, Mr. Stewart,\r\nmidshipman, ten seamen, and three marines killed; Lieutenants\r\nCheesman, Stapleton, and Innes, Messrs. Currie, Hillier, and Hibbert,\r\nfifty-three seamen, and ten marines, wounded. She was so completely\r\ndamaged in masts, rigging, and sails, that all hope of refitting her\r\nas promptly as the rest was at an end. The Spencer had Mr. Spencer, a\r\nmidshipman, and five seamen, killed; Mr. Chatterton, midshipman,\r\ntwenty-three seamen, and three marines wounded. She was damaged\r\nchiefly in her rigging and sails, which were soon repaired. The\r\nVenerable had Mr. W. Gibbons, midshipman, and eight seamen, killed;\r\nMessrs. Austin and Collins, midshipmen, twenty seamen, and four\r\nmarines, wounded; and eight missing. The Hannibal had seventy-five\r\nkilled, among whom were Mr. D. Lindsay, clerk, and Lieut. James\r\nWilliams, R.M.; and seventy wounded and missing. The Audacious had\r\neight killed; Lieut. Day, of the Marines, thirty-one seamen and\r\nmarines, wounded. The total loss of the squadron being one hundred\r\nand twenty-three killed, two hundred and forty-two wounded, and\r\ntwenty-two missing.\r\n\r\nThe loss of the French and Spaniards, by their own accounts, was\r\nconsiderable; the former having three hundred and six killed,--among\r\nwhom were Captains Moncousu, of the Dessaix, seventy-four, and\r\nLalonde, of the Indomptable, eighty-four,--and near five hundred\r\nwounded; five gun-boats were sunk, and others damaged; and the forts,\r\nin which eleven men were killed, received considerable injury. The\r\nships suffered a good deal in hull, masts, and rigging; but not so\r\nmuch as was anticipated.\r\n\r\nThe French, as might be expected, from their usual disregard to truth,\r\nmade this out one of the most brilliant exploits ever performed. Their\r\naccount stated that three French ships had completely beaten six\r\nEnglish, which took refuge in Gibraltar after leaving the Hannibal in\r\ntheir possession, &c.; saying nothing of the heavy batteries and\r\ngun-boats they had to contend with. But the Spaniards, in the Madrid\r\nGazette extraordinary, represented the \"action as very obstinate and\r\nbloody on both sides; and likewise on the part of the batteries, which\r\ndecided the fate of the day:\" and in another place, \"the fire of our\r\nbatteries was so hot and well supported that the enemy suffered most\r\nfrom them; and particularly it is to the St. Jago we owe the capture\r\nof the English ship, for her bold manoeuvre of attempting to pass\r\nbetween the French Rear-admiral's ship, the Formidable, and the shore,\r\nmade her take the ground; and, notwithstanding the utmost exertions to\r\nget her afloat, it was found impossible to move her. Then the fire\r\nfrom the battery very soon dismasted her, and compelled her to\r\nstrike.\"[34]\r\n\r\n   [34] James, vol. iii. p. 120.\r\n\r\nThe diagram, besides pointing out the situations of the five strong\r\nbatteries, which so completely protect the harbour, and which did the\r\ngreatest execution, shows the first position of the ships about the\r\ntime they all anchored, and before the enemy's ships had warped near\r\nthe shore. The second, represented by the outlines, shows the\r\nsituation of the hostile squadrons at the time the Hannibal struck,\r\nwhen the Pompee had nearly reached the Mole, the distance of which\r\nfrom Algeziras is little more than four miles, and the Spencer was\r\nconsiderably advanced in that direction.\r\n\r\nWe cannot conclude our account of this action without a few remarks on\r\nthe circumstances we have related. There cannot be a doubt that, had\r\nthe enemy remained in the position he held at the commencement of the\r\naction, every ship would have been taken. Praise is certainly due to\r\nAdmiral Linois for his able manoeuvre of warping his ships aground,\r\nbeing the only chance he had of escaping; while it was acknowledging\r\nthat, as long as his ships were continued afloat, he had no confidence\r\nin protection from the batteries, strong as they were, against the\r\nvalour and perseverance of British seamen.\r\n\r\nAlthough the attack was not crowned with the success it merited, in a\r\nnational point of view the result was as complete as if the whole\r\nsquadron had been destroyed, as the enemy were thereby prevented from\r\nproceeding further in the execution of the ulterior object of their\r\nexpedition; and the chance of this alone was sufficient to justify Sir\r\nJames in this bold and daring attempt, which, it will be seen,\r\nultimately led to one of the most glorious achievements which adorn\r\nthe annals of the empire.[35]\r\n\r\n   [35] The discrepancies between the diagram and _some_ of the\r\n   statements given in the logs, are easily accounted for by the\r\n   changes which took place in the positions of the ships during\r\n   the action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n1801.\r\n\r\n   Observations on the Battle of Algeziras.--Copies of the Journals\r\n   of the Spencer, Audacious, and Venerable.--Remarks on\r\n   them.--Further particulars.--The Spanish account.--The French\r\n   account.--Bulletin from the Moniteur.--Anecdote of an occurrence\r\n   at St. Malo.--Sword presented to Linois.--Lines on the\r\n   occasion.--His improvement of Naval tactics.--Epigram.--Anecdote\r\n   of the intrepidity of one of the Caesar's men.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been mentioned in the preceding chapter that, owing chiefly to\r\nthe minutes of Captain Ferris's court-martial, and to the\r\ndiscrepancies in different statements, a controversy has arisen on the\r\nsubject. In order to avoid the possibility of our becoming a party\r\nthereto, correct copies of the logs, which are now at the Record\r\nOffice in the Admiralty, are subjoined, after having been compared\r\nwith those at Somerset House.\r\n\r\n   Copy of the Log of his Majesty's ship Spencer, 6th July 1801.\r\n\r\n   Moderate and cloudy,--spoke his Majesty's ship Caesar, which\r\n   informed us of having intelligence of three sail of French\r\n   line-of-battle ships and a frigate being in Algeziras\r\n   Bay,--answered the signal to prepare for battle at\r\n   anchor,--employed clearing ship for battle at anchor; at 6h.\r\n   Apes hill S.E.; at half-past 6 beat the general to\r\n   quarters,--ship clear for action; A.M. light airs and variable;\r\n   at 4h. sprung up a breeze from the westward; at 7h. 58m. saw\r\n   three French sail-of-the-line and one frigate, lying under the\r\n   protection of the Spanish batteries of Algeziras, and a strong\r\n   fortified island to the southward, and a number of forts and\r\n   redoubts to the westward of them.\r\n\r\n   At 8h. 17m. the batteries commenced firing on the Venerable,\r\n   Pompee, and Audacious,--Venerable commenced firing; at 9h. 11m.\r\n   we commenced firing; at 9h. 35m. found the sheet-cable cut\r\n   through by the enemy's shot; at 9h. 48m. anchored between the\r\n   Caesar and the Hannibal, Audacious astern, the Pompee on our\r\n   larboard bow, having a battery and the French Admiral's ship to\r\n   oppose us on our larboard beam, a battery and gun-boats ahead;\r\n   at 10h. 33m. dismasted and disabled a gun-boat that was rowing\r\n   to the assistance of the others; at 10h. 39m. cut the cable per\r\n   Admiral's order whilst wearing,--the gun-boats attempted to\r\n   approach us from under the land, but the brisk fire that was\r\n   kept up made them retreat in great disorder; at 11h. 3m.\r\n   answered the signal to come to the wind on the larboard tack\r\n   (No. 98); at 11h. 7m. commenced firing at the outer ships of the\r\n   enemy, which was kept up at intervals.\r\n\r\n   At 11h. 37m. observed the Hannibal under the batteries at the\r\n   north end of the town, with her main-top-mast shot away and\r\n   aground, but keeping up a brisk fire on the enemy's ships and\r\n   batteries; P.M. Hannibal still on shore, but keeping up a brisk\r\n   fire at the enemy's ships and batteries; at 1h. 16m. observed\r\n   the Hannibal to slacken her fire, shortly after the ensign\r\n   hauled down and hoisted union downwards; at 1h. 35m. observed\r\n   the enemy's boats boarding the Hannibal; at 1h. 44m. ceased\r\n   firing,--found the ship had suffered considerably in her hull,\r\n   having several shots on both sides between wind and water. Our\r\n   loss in the action was six killed, twenty-seven badly wounded,\r\n   two of whom died of their wounds. The fore-mast, bowsprit,\r\n   main-top-mast, main-top-gallant yard, and main-top-sail yard\r\n   badly wounded; the boats and booms shot through in several\r\n   places; the cutter and yawl that were towing astern were sunk by\r\n   the enemy. At 6h. 30m. anchored per signal, and moored ship in\r\n   Rosia Bay, Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nThe following is a correct copy of the Audacious's log, at Somerset\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nThis log, like the former, begins in the evening of the 5th July 1801.\r\n\r\n   Wind S.W. P.M. moderate and hazy; half-past 2 tacked,--Cape\r\n   Trafalgar S.E. three or four leagues,--got springs on the\r\n   anchors; at 8h. standing up the Gut of Gibraltar,--Admiral S. by\r\n   W. three-quarters of a mile; at 12h. taken aback, came to the\r\n   wind on the land-tack; at 6h. Gibraltar Rock N. by E. four or\r\n   five leagues,--shortened sail to let the Pompee go ahead to her\r\n   station; at half-past 7, saw the enemy's ships at anchor in\r\n   Algeziras Roads, consisting of three line-of-battle ships, a\r\n   frigate, gun-boats, &c.; three-quarters past 7, the batteries\r\n   commenced firing on our ships as they passed; twenty minutes\r\n   past 8, the enemy's ships began to fire on our ships; at\r\n   half-past 8, the action became hot on both sides,--the\r\n   Venerable, Pompee, and Audacious as yet only in action; at\r\n   half-past 9, the Caesar, Spencer, and Hannibal joined the action\r\n   against the ships and batteries; at 11h. cut the cables, and\r\n   tried to tow the ship's head round to the eastward, to bring\r\n   the ship's broadside to bear on her opponent, but without\r\n   effect; by this time the sails and rigging being much cut up,\r\n   and the ship unmanageable, got the kedge anchor with a five-inch\r\n   hawser out on the starboard bow, and succeeded in bringing the\r\n   broadside to bear; at noon, light airs inclining to\r\n   calm,--Caesar, Spencer, under way, still in action.\r\n\r\n   P.M. dark weather; at forty-five minutes past 12, the Venerable\r\n   and Pompee hauled to the wind on the starboard tack; at 1h. cut\r\n   the sheet-cable, and slipped the end of the kedge hawser, and\r\n   spring on the sheet-anchor,--got the boats ahead to tow,--found\r\n   the ship drifting under the island fort, which did us\r\n   considerable injury,--the rocks close under the lee-bow,--cut\r\n   away the best bower-anchor to check her head, and bring her\r\n   broadside to bear, it being calm; at twenty minutes past 1, a\r\n   light breeze sprung up off-shore,--cut away the best\r\n   bower-cable, and made sail on the starboard tack,--observed the\r\n   Hannibal on shore, and the enemy take possession of her; at 4h.\r\n   anchored in Rosia Bay, Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nThe next is the journal of Captain Hood of the Venerable.\r\n\r\n   6th July 1801.\r\n\r\n   Monday, 6th July, wind variable off Algeziras,--Gibraltar Bay,\r\n   light breezes, and variable,--the captain went on board the\r\n   Caesar,--all sail set,--squadron in company,--the captain\r\n   returned,--got the sheet-cable through the stern-port, and bent\r\n   it to the anchor,--got springs on the sheet and bower-anchors;\r\n   at 2h. Captain Hood went on board the Admiral; at 3h.\r\n   returned,--received a midshipman and seven men per the Plymouth\r\n   lugger, and from the Boladore, Spanish lugger; at 4h. Cape\r\n   Trafalgar, N.E. seven or eight miles,--all sail set,--made and\r\n   shortened sail occasionally for the squadron, and tacked\r\n   occasionally,--A.M. do. weather; at 4h. made more sail; at 7h.\r\n   discovered the enemy, consisting of three two-decked ships and a\r\n   frigate, with an Admiral's flag flying, at anchor under the town\r\n   and batteries of Algeziras, protected by many gun-boats,\r\n   &c.--all sail set, standing in for the enemy, followed by the\r\n   Pompee, Audacious, Caesar, Spencer, and Hannibal; at 7h. 50m. the\r\n   batteries opened their fire on us,--Pompee and Audacious one\r\n   mile and a half distant from us astern.\r\n\r\n   At 8h. it fell calm; at 8h. 20m. the Pompee and Audacious,\r\n   bringing up the breeze, passed us to windward, when the enemy's\r\n   ships opened their fire on us; at 8h. 14m. a light air sprung\r\n   up,--passed the Audacious to leeward, at which time the Pompee\r\n   and Audacious opened their fire; at 8h. 20m. the breeze dying\r\n   away, came to with the sheet-anchor, as did the Pompee and\r\n   Audacious,--hove in the spring; and at 8h. 30m. opened our fire\r\n   on the French Admiral's ship: at 10h. the Caesar anchored on our\r\n   bow, and sent a spring on board of us; at the same time the\r\n   action became general, and the Hannibal got on shore, after\r\n   attempting to cut off the French Admiral's ship.\r\n\r\n   At 10h. 20m. the Pompee drifted between us and the French\r\n   Admiral's,--hove in our spring, and brought our guns to bear on\r\n   the other enemy's ship on our bow, and the other's stern: at\r\n   12h. the Pompee drifted between our fire and the enemy's,--slipt\r\n   the sheet-cable, and eight-inch hawser, the spring, with the\r\n   intention of getting alongside the enemy's southernmost\r\n   ship,--light air springing up at the time from the N.E.; in\r\n   awaiting this opportunity, the mizen-top-mast, fore-braces, and\r\n   jibb halyards, with various other standing and running rigging,\r\n   shot away, and main-mast badly wounded: at 11h. 15m. breeze\r\n   dying away prevented our intention,--opened our fire on the\r\n   southernmost ship; at 12h. calm and hazy,--Caesar, Hannibal,\r\n   Audacious, Spencer, and us still firing on the enemy's ships,\r\n   batteries, and gun-boats,--boats of the squadron towing off the\r\n   Pompee to Gibraltar; P.M. calm,--still firing on the enemy's\r\n   ships, which were warping farther in-shore.\r\n\r\n   At 12h. 40m. sent Lieutenant Collis in the pinnace to assist the\r\n   Hannibal; at 1h. 40m. finding it impossible to near the enemy's\r\n   ships with safety, it being calm, and a strong current setting\r\n   in-shore, their batteries firing red-hot shot and throwing\r\n   shells, ceased the action as per signal, as did the other ships,\r\n   and steered for Gibraltar,--observed the Hannibal ceased firing,\r\n   and hoist the colours reversed, having her fore and mainmasts\r\n   shot away, and being in ten foot water, rendered all assistance\r\n   useless.\r\n\r\n   24 Nov. 1801.[36]\r\n   S. HOOD.\r\n\r\n     [36] The journal of Lieutenant Collis of the Venerable, the\r\n     officer who was sent to assist the Hannibal, and was taken\r\n     prisoner when on board, but who was sent to Gibraltar on parole,\r\n     need not be given, as it is an exact copy of the captain's log.\r\n\r\nThus the logs and journals of the captains and officers of the\r\nSpencer, Audacious, Venerable, and Caesar, all agree that the Hannibal\r\nstruck her colours between 1h. 20m. and 1h. 40m. The Pompee, being by\r\nthis time near the Mole at Gibraltar, could not see nor take minutes\r\nof that circumstance. The Spencer, according to her position at that\r\ntime, was in the best situation for seeing the Hannibal, and\r\naccordingly her log is the most particular. The Caesar's log need not\r\nbe given, as it would be merely a repetition of Captain Brenton's\r\nnarrative. All these agree with Colonel Connolly's testimony, and\r\ntheir evidence is quite conclusive as to the following facts; namely,\r\nthat the Hannibal struck her colours before the main-mast fell; that\r\nthese colours were hoisted union down by the enemy, who had possession\r\nof the ship before the boats came alongside from the Venerable and\r\nCaesar, and that to save her was quite impossible.\r\n\r\nThe following further particulars relative to the action are given in\r\nthe extract of a letter from an officer of the Caesar, dated at\r\nGibraltar:\r\n\r\n   There is one point that needs explanation; namely, when the\r\n   Caesar cut her cable at half-past ten o'clock, it was from a fine\r\n   breeze springing up, and the hope of closing with the enemy.\r\n   Orders were given for that purpose to the Audacious and\r\n   Venerable; the Caesar wore round them, and brought her broadside\r\n   to bear on the Indomptable's bow, lying there (about three\r\n   cables distant from her) a considerable time, with the\r\n   fore-top-sail to the mast (aback). The Audacious, bringing up a\r\n   breeze from the north-west, passed between us and the enemy,\r\n   who, in this part of the day, suffered materially, his\r\n   fore-top-mast going about five minutes before twelve o'clock.\r\n   Shortly afterwards, the Audacious and Caesar were becalmed upon\r\n   the broadside of the Indomptable, without being able to bring\r\n   one of their guns to bear,--the Caesar not more than three\r\n   cables' length from the island battery, and the Audacious still\r\n   nearer,--both ships drifting on the reef.\r\n\r\n   It was at this time that Sir James Saumarez formed the\r\n   resolution of attacking the island with marines. Boats were\r\n   signalised for the purpose; but, being all employed with the\r\n   Pompee, or sunk by the enemy's fire, it was found\r\n   impracticable. A breeze again sprung up, and Sir James directed\r\n   his ship to be laid alongside of the Indomptable, in the firm\r\n   resolution of carrying her. The sails were trimmed for that\r\n   purpose as well as the crippled state of the masts would allow,\r\n   but a calm ensued. The Venerable had never received the breeze\r\n   from the time of her cutting, and still lay unmanageable. The\r\n   Spencer had drifted considerably in repairing her rigging.\r\n\r\nThe following is a translation of the Spanish official account of the\r\nbattle of Algeziras, 6th July 1801:\r\n\r\n   The division of three French line-of-battle ships and one\r\n   frigate, under the command of Rear-admiral Citizen Linois, that\r\n   sailed from the road of Toulon on the 25th last June, destined\r\n   for Cadiz, came in sight of this station and bay on the 1st of\r\n   July; and, the Levant wind having failed on entering the\r\n   Straits, they cruised between the coast of Africa and that of\r\n   Europe, in which they captured the English brig of war the\r\n   Speedy, of sixteen guns, that was a Mahon packet, and was\r\n   conducting to Gibraltar a prize, the merchant brig the Union,\r\n   loaded with oil and provisions.\r\n\r\n   The continuation of the westerly winds obliged the said division\r\n   to come into this port on the 5th instant, at seven in the\r\n   evening. From that moment, recollecting the desperate attacks of\r\n   the English at Alexandria and Copenhagen, we could not but\r\n   expect that their squadron, which had been seen off Cadiz on the\r\n   3rd instant, under the command of Rear-admiral Saumarez, would\r\n   come and attack this division. So it happened.\r\n\r\n   As soon as the English received intelligence where the French\r\n   had anchored, they steered directly for the Straits; and, on the\r\n   6th instant, at half-past six in the morning, six English ships\r\n   doubled the Point of Carnero, and, coming round the island of\r\n   Algeziras, advanced in a line within half cannon-shot of the\r\n   French ships. The batteries of St. Garcia and the island opened\r\n   their fire upon the English; and afterwards the frigate and\r\n   republican ships.\r\n\r\n   As soon as the English line came opposite the French ships at\r\n   anchor, they opened upon them an animated, bold, and unremitting\r\n   fire. The English Admiral having placed himself against the\r\n   French, and the British ship Hannibal being under sail,\r\n   cannonaded furiously the French Admiral, who, with superior\r\n   spirit and success, resisted them; insomuch that, having carried\r\n   away the Admiral's mizen-mast, and sails of the main and\r\n   fore-mast, with no small damage of his hull, the commander of\r\n   the English ship Hannibal, despising the fire from the battery\r\n   of St. Jago, pushed on to his succour; and, intending to place\r\n   the French Admiral between two fires, by running between him and\r\n   the shore, had the imprudence, being unacquainted with his\r\n   position, to place himself within a quarter of a gun-shot of the\r\n   battery, and ran aground. He relieved his Admiral, who, after\r\n   this, went out of the action; but he lost his own ship and crew,\r\n   as the fire from the battery and French Admiral dismantled him,\r\n   and killed three parts of his ship's company.\r\n\r\n   Until this ship's surrender, which was about the time of the\r\n   retreat of the English Admiral, the fire was constant upon the\r\n   two French ships and frigate, as well as upon the seven Spanish\r\n   gun-boats, the batteries of the island, St. Garcia, St. Jago, La\r\n   Almiranta, and Almirante, which, as opportunity offered,\r\n   returned their fire.\r\n\r\n   The battle lasted from half-past eight o'clock in the morning,\r\n   when the fort of St. Garcia opened its fire, till two in the\r\n   afternoon, when the last shot was fired from the French ship\r\n   Indomptable. The persevering, active, and tremendous fire of the\r\n   enemy, and that of the two nations (French and Spanish), were\r\n   only distinguishable by the prudence, skill, and greatness of\r\n   soul with which the allied chiefs directed theirs, and the\r\n   audacity, temerity, and confusion which were shown in that of\r\n   the English. The idea of this kind of fighting, which we form\r\n   from the account of the battles of Alexandria and Copenhagen,\r\n   does not, in proportion to the numbers engaged, bear any\r\n   comparison with that of Algeziras, either in point of bloodiness\r\n   or obstinacy.\r\n\r\n   The English, after having left the glory and the field of battle\r\n   to the two nations, covered with shame, and taught by\r\n   dear-bought experience, have only given an unequivocal proof of\r\n   their inveterate hatred to France and Spain; since, not being\r\n   able to obtain any advantage over the French and Spanish forces,\r\n   they directed their fire against an inoffensive town, which\r\n   received no small injury in the buildings. This is the only\r\n   glory which the arms of Great Britain have to boast of.\r\n\r\n   The Pompee was towed out of the action by eight boats, who came\r\n   to her succour from the garrison of Gibraltar. She was kept\r\n   afloat by casks, or otherwise could not have been brought in.\r\n\r\n   The ships of the French Republic which sustained this attack\r\n   were the Formidable, 84, Citizen Linois; Dessaix, 74, Moncousu,\r\n   killed; L'Indomptable, 84, La Londe, killed; the frigate Muiron,\r\n   36, Martinencq; five Spanish gun-boats damaged, and two sunk. In\r\n   the French ships, three hundred and six killed; one hundred and\r\n   eighty-four wounded. We suppose in the English squadron above\r\n   five hundred are killed, and from two hundred and seventy to two\r\n   hundred and eighty wounded.\r\n\r\n   MADRID GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY.\r\n\r\n   Merida, 10 July 1801.\r\n\r\n   The general commandant of the camp at St. Roque, in a despatch\r\n   of the 6th instant, transmitted by a courier extraordinary,\r\n   communicates an account of an action which has been fought\r\n   between six sail of the line, and other vessels of war,\r\n   belonging to the English, and the French squadron of three ships\r\n   of the line, and one frigate, lying at anchor in the harbour of\r\n   Algeziras; and of the glorious result which has taken place for\r\n   his Majesty's arms, and those of the Republic, his ally.\r\n\r\n   About eight in the morning of that day, (viz. the 6th,) there\r\n   were seen, coming out of Gibraltar, one ship of eighty-four\r\n   guns, five of seventy-four, a lugger of sixteen, another of ten,\r\n   and a polacre of ten, two armed launches, and fourteen boats.\r\n   This force, under the command of a Rear-admiral, stood into\r\n   Algeziras, for the purpose of attacking the French squadron then\r\n   anchored in that port, which, as has been already stated,\r\n   consisted of three sail of the line, and one frigate. The\r\n   commanders of this squadron, being aware of the enemy's\r\n   intention, made their dispositions for defence, placing\r\n   themselves, as well as they were able, under the cover of our\r\n   batteries, and waiting in this position for his approach.\r\n\r\n   The action commenced at nine; it was very obstinate and bloody\r\n   on both sides, and likewise on the part of our batteries, which\r\n   decided the fate of the day. The action was continued till two\r\n   in the afternoon, at which hour the English drew off with the\r\n   loss of one ship of the line; taking in tow another, which was\r\n   dismasted and damaged in the hull; and having sustained very\r\n   great loss and damage in the rest of their vessels. Their loss\r\n   in men must have been considerable, as it is certain that a\r\n   great number were killed and wounded on board all the ships. The\r\n   French also have been equal sufferers, the killed and wounded\r\n   in their squadron being estimated at eight hundred: that of our\r\n   troops has been less; out of the whole, only the royal regiment\r\n   of Ronda has lost eleven men.\r\n\r\n   The fire of our batteries was so hot and well supported, that\r\n   the enemy suffered most from them; and particularly it is to\r\n   that of St. Jago we owe the capture of the English ship, for her\r\n   bold manoeuvre of attempting to pass between the French\r\n   Rear-admiral's ship, the Formidable, and the shore, made her\r\n   take the ground; and, notwithstanding the utmost exertion to put\r\n   her afloat, it being found impossible to move her, the fire from\r\n   the battery very soon dismasted her, and compelled her to\r\n   strike. The French vessels, and our batteries, have likewise\r\n   received a good deal of damage; but they are already in a course\r\n   of repair; and the most active dispositions are making in order\r\n   to cause the enemy to repent, should he have any intention of\r\n   renewing the action with troops so animated and well-conducted\r\n   as ours and the French have proved themselves in the engagement\r\n   of the 6th.\r\n\r\nThe French account of this action, as we have already noticed, was\r\nstill more exaggerated than the Spanish; and, unfortunately for the\r\nfriends and relatives of the Admiral, officers, and men of the\r\nsquadron, it made its way to England some time previously to the\r\n_true_ accounts,--causing much uneasiness. The _Moniteur_ announced\r\nthat\r\n\r\n   On the 5th July, at eight o'clock in the morning, the cannonade\r\n   commenced against six English ships, which lost no time in\r\n   coming within musket-shot of the French vessels. The action then\r\n   became very warm. These two squadrons seemed equally animated\r\n   with a determination to conquer. If the French squadron had any\r\n   advantage in point of situation, the English had double their\r\n   force, and several of their vessels had ninety guns each:\r\n   already had the English ship, Hannibal, of seventy-four guns,\r\n   contrived to place herself between the French squadron and the\r\n   shore. It was now eleven o'clock A.M., and this proved the\r\n   decisive moment. For two hours the Formidable, the French\r\n   Admiral's ship, successfully opposed three English ships.\r\n\r\n   One of the British squadron, which was singly engaged with a\r\n   French vessel, struck her colours at three-quarters past eleven.\r\n   Immediately after, the Hannibal, exposed to the fire of three\r\n   French ships, which fired from two decks, also struck her\r\n   colours: about half-past twelve, the English squadron cut their\r\n   cables, and sailed away. The Hannibal was boarded by the\r\n   Formidable. Of six hundred men, who composed her crew, three\r\n   hundred were killed. The first ship that struck her colours was\r\n   retaken by a great number of gun-boats, and other vessels, sent\r\n   out from Gibraltar. This action covers the French arms with\r\n   glory, and shows what they are capable of accomplishing.\r\n   Rear-admiral Linois _proceeded to Cadiz with the Hannibal, in\r\n   order to repair her damage_.[37] We wait with impatience the\r\n   returns of the loss sustained by each ship.\r\n\r\n     [37] This was a gratuitous falsehood.\r\n\r\nThese accounts appear to have reached Paris on the 11th July. On the\r\n19th, the following bulletin reached St. Malo.\r\n\r\n   Three French ships of the line and a frigate, under the command\r\n   of Rear-admiral Linois, were attacked on the 6th instant by six\r\n   English sail of the line and a frigate. The English were\r\n   completely beaten, and took refuge in Gibraltar, leaving in\r\n   possession of the French the Hannibal, of seventy-four guns:\r\n   another ship of the line had struck, but was towed off by a\r\n   great number of gun-vessels, which sailed from Gibraltar to her\r\n   relief.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, the Jason frigate, having been wrecked near St. Malo,\r\nthe captain and crew were made prisoners. The author was sent in with\r\na flag of truce by Commodore Cunningham, of the Clyde, to negotiate\r\nfor the exchange of prisoners; when the French officer, with an air of\r\ntriumph and exultation, handed him a copy of that bulletin: but, as\r\nsoon as the negotiation was ended, the author had the pleasure of\r\nhanding to him, in return, the Gazette account of the victory of the\r\n13th, which Sir James Saumarez had gained over Linois, and which the\r\nCommodore had received, fortunately, on that day. The Frenchman's\r\nchagrin may be easily imagined, when he threw down the Gazette, with\r\nthe exclamation '_Ce n'est pas vrai_!'\r\n\r\nOn the statement of Linois' victory, as it was called, reaching Paris,\r\na handsome sword was sent to him; which, however, did not reach him\r\nuntil after his subsequent defeat. On this occasion the following\r\nEpigram was written.\r\n\r\n     In the days of the Bourbons, a man was _rewarded_\r\n       For _standing_ the brunt of the day:\r\n     But, now, this old maxim in France is _discarded_,--\r\n       Men are honoured for _running away_!\r\n\r\nIn the French accounts nothing was mentioned of their running their\r\nships aground to escape from the English, which is, indeed, the only\r\nthing Citizen Linois deserved any credit for doing. At the same time,\r\nit could not fail to convince both the French and Spanish troops, of\r\nthe want of confidence he must have had in his crews, and of their\r\nevident inferiority: it was certainly a new mode of fighting, which\r\ncalled forth the following lines on this improvement in naval tactics.\r\n\r\n     To mar our skill, fam'd Linois, thou hast found\r\n     A certain way,--by fighting ships on _ground_;\r\n     Fix deep in sand thy centre, van, and rear,\r\n     Nor e'er St. Vincent, Duncan, Nelson, fear.\r\n     While, o'er the main, Britannia's thunder rolls,\r\n     She leaves to thee the trident of the _shoals_!\r\n\r\nIn concluding this chapter, we shall relate the following anecdote of\r\nBritish heroism, derived from Captain Brenton's Naval History.\r\n\r\n   When, in the hottest part of the action at Algeziras, the Caesar\r\n   _broke her sheer_,--that is, her situation was altered by a puff\r\n   or flaw of wind so as to change the direction of her head, and\r\n   turn her round, that her guns could not be brought to bear on\r\n   her opponent,--the captain ordered the boat to be lowered down\r\n   from the stern, to convey a warp to the Audacious; but the boat\r\n   was found to be knocked to pieces by the enemy's shot. Before\r\n   other means could be resorted to, Michael Collins, a young\r\n   sailor belonging to the Caesar's mizen-top, seized the end of a\r\n   lead-line, and exclaiming, \"You shall soon have a warp,\" darted\r\n   into the sea from the tafrail, and swam with the line to the\r\n   Audacious, where it was received, and by that means a hawser was\r\n   run out which answered the intended purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n1801.\r\n\r\n   Mole of Gibraltar.--Negociation for the exchange of prisoners\r\n   unsuccessful.--Captain Ferris and the officers of the Hannibal\r\n   return on parole.--They sail for England in the Plymouth lugger,\r\n   which carries home despatches and private letters.--Despatch\r\n   sent to Lord Keith.--Admiral Saumarez shifts his flag to the\r\n   Audacious.--Extraordinary exertions of the crew of the\r\n   Caesar.--Their admirable conduct.--Captain Brenton and the\r\n   garrison.--Arrival of the Spanish squadron at\r\n   Algeziras.--Increased exertions of the crews of the\r\n   squadron.--Private letters.--Preparations to attack the enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe squadron being now in the Mole at Gibraltar, the wounded having\r\nbeen removed to the hospital, and the necessary orders given for\r\nrefitting with all possible speed, the Admiral lost no time in turning\r\nhis attention to the situation of the captain, officers, and crew of\r\nthe unfortunate Hannibal, which had so nobly maintained the honour of\r\nthe British flag.\r\n\r\nSir Jahleel Brenton says, \"He ordered me to take a flag of truce, and\r\nwait upon the French admiral (Linois), proposing an exchange of\r\nprisoners, which the latter refused, alleging that it was not in his\r\npower to establish a cartel for the purpose, until he obtained the\r\nsanction of the Minister of the Marine at Paris, to whom he had sent\r\noff an express, as soon as the firing had ceased, on the preceding\r\nday; but he consented to send over on parole Captain Ferris and the\r\nofficers of the Hannibal. The object of the French Admiral was very\r\nobvious; he concluded we wanted to replace the men who were killed,\r\nand wounded; but he justly thought, that sending officers on parole\r\nwould be an act of harmless courtesy, from which we could reap no\r\nimmediate benefit. It will be seen that, after the second action, when\r\nhis dispatches from Algeziras could scarcely have reached Paris, (only\r\nsix days having elapsed,) he did not wait for an answer from the\r\nMinister of Marine. But circumstances had altered; we had taken a\r\nline-of-battle ship, and burned two first-rates; and he then wished to\r\nget back as many of the crews as possible.\"\r\n\r\nThe following correspondence, which took place between Sir James\r\nSaumarez and the French Admiral Linois, shows the deep interest Sir\r\nJames took in the distressing situation of the crew of the Hannibal,\r\nof which an account was brought to him by Captain Brenton, together\r\nwith the assurance that Captain Ferris and his officers would be\r\nliberated on parole.\r\n\r\n   Caesar, off Rosia Bay, 8th July 1801.\r\n\r\n   SIR,\r\n\r\n   Solicitous as I am for the welfare of the men unfortunately\r\n   wounded on board his Majesty's ship Hannibal, and desirous to\r\n   have them conveyed as speedily as possible to this garrison, I\r\n   propose to send a boat early to-morrow morning with a flag of\r\n   truce, and I trust no objection can be made to their coming by\r\n   her.\r\n\r\n   Being informed that Captain Ferris and his officers have\r\n   permission to come on their parole, a boat will also be sent for\r\n   them. I have the honour to be, sir,\r\n\r\n   Your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n   JAS. SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n   To Rear-admiral Linois,\r\n   commanding the French squadron at Algeziras.\r\n\r\nThe boat having returned from Algeziras with Captain Ferris and his\r\nofficers, but not with the crew of the Hannibal, Sir James despatched\r\nanother boat, with the following letter to Admiral Linois:\r\n\r\n   Caesar, off Rosia Bay, 9th July 1801.\r\n\r\n   SIR,\r\n\r\n   Having received different reports, particularly from Captain\r\n   Ferris, that the men who had the misfortune of being wounded on\r\n   board his Majesty's ship Hannibal are left in the most\r\n   afflicting condition, and are unprovided with every kind of\r\n   refreshment, I am impelled, from motives of humanity, to renew\r\n   my application to you that they may be permitted to come to this\r\n   place by the boat now sent for them; and that you will also\r\n   permit those wounded men who are confined in the prison, and\r\n   who, I understand, are without any surgical attendance whatever,\r\n   to accompany them. I have the honour to be, sir,\r\n\r\n   With all possible regard, your obedient servant,\r\n   JAMES SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n   To Rear-admiral Linois,\r\n   commanding the French squadron at Algeziras.\r\n\r\nThis application was, however, not attended with success; and the\r\nsufferings of the unfortunate wounded at Algeziras were extreme, until\r\ncircumstances changed, in consequence of the second action.\r\n\r\nWe shall now continue the authentic and interesting communication\r\nwhich Sir Jahleel Brenton has so kindly made to us:\r\n\r\n   \"The morning of the 7th July was passed in getting the Caesar\r\n   secured in the Mole, and in landing the wounded men that still\r\n   remained on board; also in stripping the ship, and in\r\n   ascertaining the amount of injury she had sustained. The\r\n   main-mast was so much injured that it became necessary to take\r\n   it out and get in a new one; the fore-mast was also very badly\r\n   wounded, but capable of being fished and rendered serviceable.\r\n   Every effort was made to complete our repairs, and get again\r\n   ready for sea. On the following day, Captain Ferris and his\r\n   officers, who were sent on parole, arrived. They were\r\n   accompanied by Lord Cochrane and the officers of the Speedy,\r\n   sloop of war, which had been taken on the 3rd by Linois'\r\n   squadron, off Malaga.\"\r\n\r\nThe Admiral now prepared duplicates of his despatches for the\r\nAdmiralty, which Lieutenant Janvarin, of the Calpe, who was taken in\r\nthe Caesar's boat, assisting the Hannibal, had been previously charged\r\nto carry to Faro. These were confided to Lieutenant Hills, of the\r\nHannibal, who, with Captain Ferris, were embarked on board the\r\nPlymouth lugger for England. Sir Jableel Brenton says: \"On taking\r\nleave of the Admiral, the scene was deeply interesting, and even\r\naffecting. Sir James, after giving Captain Ferris the highest credit\r\nfor his gallant daring, to which the loss of the Hannibal was\r\nattributed, and lamenting that their united endeavours had not been\r\ncrowned with the success they merited, added, adverting to his\r\ndespatches, 'Tell them, sir, that I feel convinced I shall soon have\r\nan opportunity of attacking the enemy again, and that they may depend\r\non my availing myself of it.'\"\r\n\r\nOn the 9th, in the afternoon, the Superb and Thames, which had\r\ncontinued to watch the enemy off Cadiz, were seen coming through the\r\nStraits under a crowd of canvass, with the signal for an enemy flying;\r\nand they had scarcely rounded Cabrita Point before the Spanish\r\nsquadron, consisting of six sail of the line, were seen in pursuit of\r\nthem, and soon after anchored in Algeziras with the French squadron.\r\n\r\nSir James now added the following to his despatches to Lord Keith:\r\n\r\n   Caesar, Gibraltar, 9th July 1801.\r\n\r\n   MY LORD,\r\n\r\n   I have the honour to inform your lordship that the Superb and\r\n   Thames are now standing into the bay, with the signal for the\r\n   enemy's being in sight; and I understand from Governor O'Hara\r\n   that he has information from Cadiz that all the Spanish and\r\n   French ships in that port were ordered to Algeziras Bay to take\r\n   the French ships to Carthagena.\r\n\r\n   I hope to have all the squadron ready before this day week; and,\r\n   as they cannot possibly put to sea under a fortnight at the\r\n   earliest, I hope something may join me from your lordship before\r\n   they can put to sea: but, on the event of their sailing before\r\n   such junction, I shall follow them up with all the ships with\r\n   me, and proceed off Minorca, which will be my rendezvous till I\r\n   have the honour of hearing from your lordship.\r\n\r\n   I am sorry to mention that the Hannibal is got off; but Captain\r\n   Ferris, who has just come over on his parole, describes her in\r\n   the worst condition, as well as the three French ships, and does\r\n   not think they can be repaired under a fortnight or three weeks\r\n   at the earliest; as does Lord Cochrane, who is likewise come\r\n   over on his parole.\r\n\r\n   I have the honour to be\r\n   Your lordship's most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n   JAMES SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n   To Right Hon. Lord Keith, K.B. &c. &c. &c.\r\n\r\nThe public despatches being closed, Sir James wrote the following\r\nletters, which were sent by the same conveyance; and, as they contain\r\nhis own private feelings on the occasion, they will be read with\r\ninterest:\r\n\r\n   Caesar, Rosia Bay, 6th July 1801.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR RICHARD,\r\n\r\n   After the warm expectations my friends have always formed for my\r\n   success in the public service, they will be distressed on being\r\n   informed of my having failed in an enterprise with the squadron\r\n   on three French line-of-battle ships at anchor off Algeziras. I\r\n   was informed by different expresses from this garrison of their\r\n   having attempted to pass the Straits for Cadiz, and having\r\n   anchored at some distance from the batteries. I made sail\r\n   yesterday with the intention to attack them, if found\r\n   practicable. We got round the point of the bay at about seven\r\n   this morning, and at half-past eight the action began, and\r\n   during the first hour, promised the most favourable hopes of\r\n   success; when, by a most unfortunate circumstance, the Hannibal\r\n   got aground, and at once destroyed all my expectations, though\r\n   the action was continued for nearly four hours after.\r\n\r\n   Every possible effort was made to rescue her from the enemy's\r\n   fire; and after repeated attempts, and a very great risk of this\r\n   ship and the Audacious getting on shore under the enemy's\r\n   batteries, I was under the necessity of abandoning the Hannibal\r\n   to her fate. Although we have not succeeded in bringing off the\r\n   enemy's ships, they are, we believe, very seriously damaged. Two\r\n   of them are aground, and it is not expected they will be got\r\n   off.\r\n\r\n   Wednesday, 9th July 1801.\r\n\r\n   Having found a conveyance by way of Tangier, I sent you a\r\n   duplicate of this. The Superb and Thames have just made their\r\n   appearance, with the signal for the enemy being out of port. I\r\n   think it is a good thing to have drawn them this way, as I trust\r\n   the first Levanter will bring us ships from the Mediterranean.\r\n   Captain Ferris goes by this opportunity, and has promised to\r\n   forward this immediately to you. He will be heard of at the\r\n   Admiralty, or at the Adelphi Hotel. Great praise is due for the\r\n   brave defence of his ship.\r\n\r\n   10th July 1801.\r\n\r\n   It is incalculable how much I have on my hands, night and day;\r\n   but, thank God! my health is good, though my anxiety is great. A\r\n   fresh Levanter having sprung up, the lugger sails immediately.\r\n   Phil. Dumaresq is very well, as are all the others. Poor Graves\r\n   is the only person we have lost of the class of officers. I also\r\n   wrote to you, by way of Lisbon, only an hour since, and just\r\n   before the easterly wind set in. I trust none of my friends will\r\n   suffer anxiety on my account. This will be addressed to you, my\r\n   dear Richard, and you will forward it to my brother. He will be\r\n   happy in being able to satisfy those who have friends on board\r\n   that they have all escaped unhurt. H. Brock, with the young men\r\n   from the island, are all well. I am, &c.\r\n\r\n   JAS. SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n   To Richard Saumarez, Esq.\r\n\r\nExtracts of letters written on the 7th July 1801, to Lady Saumarez:\r\n\r\n   I have formed a thousand apprehensions lest an account of the\r\n   events of yesterday should reach England through France before\r\n   the arrival of my despatches (which were sent off by way of\r\n   Faro), and fill your mind with cruel anxiety on my account; and\r\n   this fear is much increased lest those despatches should not\r\n   even arrive, as I was obliged to send them by a doubtful\r\n   opportunity, through Tetuan and Tangier, the wind not admitting\r\n   any vessel to pass the Straits.\r\n\r\n   Trusting, however, to their safety, I will not repeat their\r\n   contents; but will only observe that, when I sat down to write\r\n   to you, it was the first interval of rest from one of the most\r\n   bustling scenes I ever witnessed, and from experiencing one of\r\n   the severest disappointments I have ever known; having, for a\r\n   considerable period during the action, flattered myself with the\r\n   strongest confidence that the most complete success would have\r\n   attended the enterprise.\r\n\r\n   I resign myself to the decree of DIVINE PROVIDENCE, whose will\r\n   the winds obey; and I have great cause to be thankful for not\r\n   having been forsaken in the hour of danger, but for having my\r\n   courage strengthened as the peril increased. Feeling, as I do,\r\n   all the responsibility on an event of this importance to the\r\n   country, I should be miserable had I to reproach myself for\r\n   having undertaken the enterprise on light grounds, or with\r\n   having failed in the planning or in the execution; but, on the\r\n   contrary, it is admitted by every one to have been most\r\n   judicious. It is therefore only in the result that I have been\r\n   unfortunate, and that arising from unforeseen and inevitable\r\n   causes. I have been too much employed to reflect on the light in\r\n   which the business may be viewed in England; but, conscious of\r\n   having done my duty, and to the utmost of my exertions, I shall\r\n   be indifferent as to the rest. I only trust that all my friends,\r\n   but you more particularly, will be superior to any reflexions\r\n   that may be made, should there be any unfavourable to me; though\r\n   I hope for better things, and that with the liberal, at least,\r\n   that which has been well intended, and carried on with conduct\r\n   and bravery, will be held in some estimation.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Linois, from the specimen he had had of the determined\r\nperseverance of the British commander-in-chief, had no wish to try\r\nanother contest; nor was it possible for him to escape the risk of\r\none, either by lying under the protection of the Spanish batteries, or\r\nby proceeding to Cadiz. He lost no time, therefore, in sending an\r\nexpress to the Spanish Admiral Mazzaredo, and the French Rear-admiral\r\nDumanoir, who, with Commodore Le Ray and other officers and men, had\r\npreviously arrived in two frigates at Cadiz for the purpose of\r\nequipping the Spanish fleet, imploring the assistance of a squadron to\r\nconvoy them to Cadiz, before the English ships under Sir James\r\nSaumarez could be refitted; adding in his despatch, \"I have just\r\nreceived advice that the enemy intends burning us at our anchorage. It\r\nis in your power to save for the Republic three fine ships of the line\r\nand a frigate by merely ordering the Spanish squadron to come and seek\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\nThis demand, through the influence of Admiral Dumanoir, was\r\nimmediately acceded to by Mazzaredo, who ordered Vice-admiral Moreno\r\nto proceed with five sail of the line, three frigates, and a lugger,\r\naccompanied by the San Antonio, manned partly with French and\r\nSpaniards, in which Admiral Dumanoir hoisted his flag. The movements\r\nof these ships were observed by Captain Keats in the Superb, who, in\r\nconsequence of information he had received from an American, returned\r\nwith the Thames and Pasley off Cadiz.\r\n\r\nAt daylight, on the 9th, this squadron put to sea, except the San\r\nAntonio, which, being unable to fetch out, came to an anchor in the\r\nroad. The rest made sail up the Straits, preceded by the Superb,\r\nThames, and Pasley; and, the wind being fair, the former reached\r\nAlgeziras about four P.M., while the latter, as already stated,\r\nanchored in Gibraltar Bay, to unite their efforts in refitting the\r\nshattered ships. On the next morning, the San Antonio, with Admiral\r\nDumanoir's flag, arrived at Algeziras.\r\n\r\nAs the object of this overwhelming force could be no other than to\r\nconduct in safety the three French ships, and their prize the\r\nHannibal, to Cadiz or Carthagena, the exertions of the British\r\nofficers and men were redoubled in getting the damaged ships ready to\r\nmeet the enemy. They accomplished what has been justly acknowledged,\r\none of the most extraordinary undertakings ever known.\r\n\r\nThe Pompee was in too bad a state to leave any hopes that she could be\r\ngot ready in time; her men, therefore, were distributed to assist in\r\nrepairing the other ships: and all idea of refitting the Caesar was on\r\nthe point of being abandoned!\r\n\r\nThe following account given by Captain Brenton will be read with much\r\ninterest: \"Sir James now expressed the greatest anxiety to have as\r\nmany of his little squadron as possible ready for action, that he\r\nmight avail himself at any moment of the motions of the enemy to make\r\nan attack upon some part of them; and despairing, from the state of\r\nthe Caesar, that she could possibly be got in readiness before the\r\ndeparture of the ships from Algeziras, he expressed a wish that the\r\ndeficiencies in the other ships might be made up from the crew of the\r\nCaesar; but on my entreaty for permission to keep them while a\r\npossibility remained of getting her in a state to receive his flag\r\nagain, he consented, hoisting it for the time on board the Audacious.\r\n\r\n\"On communicating to the people what had passed, there was a universal\r\ncry, 'All hands all night and all day until the ship is ready!' so\r\nearnest were they to carry the flag of their beloved Admiral again\r\ninto battle, and so sanguine in the expectation of victory,\r\nnotwithstanding the disparity of force,--nearly _two to one_! This I\r\ncould not consent to, as they would have been worn out and incapable\r\nof further exertion; but I directed that all hands should be employed\r\nduring the day, and that they should work _watch and watch_ during the\r\nnight. They immediately commenced their various duties, with all the\r\nenergy and zeal that could be expected from men under such powerful\r\ncauses of excitement. The new main-mast was got in forthwith, and\r\nextraordinary efforts made to refit the rigging.\r\n\r\n\"On Saturday, the 11th, the enemy showed symptoms of moving; and the\r\nAdmiral, fearing they might get out in the night, again suggested that\r\nthe people from the Caesar should be distributed, and every idea of\r\ngetting her ready abandoned; but I entreated, and obtained permission\r\nto keep them during that night, under the promise that they should be\r\nheld in readiness at a minute's warning to proceed to the ship pointed\r\nout to receive them.\r\n\r\n\"The enemy having anchored again, the Admiral went to dine with the\r\ngovernor; and, on his return on board, was greatly delighted at\r\nbeholding the ship apparently ready for sea, although much yet\r\nremained to be done.\"\r\n\r\nWe must here pay a just tribute to the professional abilities and\r\nconduct of Captain (now Sir Jahleel) Brenton. He was, in the first\r\nplace, well aware of the magnitude of the labour which the men had to\r\nperform, and saw the danger of allowing his brave crew to be worn out\r\nwith fatigue in attempting that to which the human frame is unequal.\r\nHe therefore decided that, instead of working on until the labour was\r\nfinished, according to the seamen's laudable wishes, they should have\r\nsuch a portion of rest as would enable them to resume their labour\r\nwith renewed energy. In the second place, he knew that without system,\r\nthe exertions of the men would be in vain; but the admirable\r\ndirections he gave employed every man in what he was best able to\r\nperform without impeding his neighbour, whilst every part of the\r\nlabour advanced simultaneously. There has, indeed, never yet been on\r\nrecord an instance of a ship performing such a task so well and in so\r\nshort a time.\r\n\r\nAlthough the services going on required many men to be on shore for\r\ngunpowder and other stores, to replace what had been expended, there\r\nwas not a single complaint of any one absenting himself from his duty,\r\nor of being intoxicated; though the inducement must have been great,\r\nfrom the number of wine-houses on the Rock: but such was the desire of\r\nthese brave fellows to be avenged for the loss of the Hannibal, that\r\nthey would not allow any temptation to induce them to swerve from the\r\nduty they had to perform.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary anxiety of mind, and the multiplicity of duty he had\r\nto perform, did not divert the attention of Sir James from the\r\nsituation of the unfortunate crew of the Hannibal, especially the\r\nwounded, who were suffering as well from want of proper surgical care\r\nas from the treatment they had received. He once more made a strong,\r\nbut fruitless attempt for their exchange, by addressing the following\r\nletter to Admiral Linois:\r\n\r\n   Caesar, off Rosia Bay, 10th July 1801.\r\n\r\n   SIR,\r\n\r\n   I am impelled by motives of humanity again to renew my\r\n   application in behalf of the men unfortunately wounded on board\r\n   his Britannic Majesty's ship Hannibal, and to request they may\r\n   be permitted to come to this garrison without delay. A\r\n   proposition so conformable to the laws of civilised nations I\r\n   trust cannot be rejected; but, should you further refuse to\r\n   comply with it, you must take upon yourself the impression all\r\n   the world must have of so cruel a proceeding as to deny those\r\n   unhappy people the benefit of their own hospital, where they\r\n   would receive surgical assistance, and not be subjected to the\r\n   severe treatment they have so long experienced in their present\r\n   situation.\r\n\r\n   I am, sir,\r\n   Your most obedient humble servant,\r\n   JAMES SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n   Rear-admiral Linois, &c. &c. &c.\r\n\r\nNo answer having been given to this application, the correspondence\r\nended, to be resumed under more favourable circumstances.\r\n\r\nSir James now added to the duplicates of his despatches (which had\r\nbeen sent in charge of Lieutenant Janvarin, by way of Tangier,) the\r\nfollowing letter to his brother:\r\n\r\n   Caesar, Gibraltar, 10th July 1801.\r\n\r\n   You will, I hope, receive the letters I have written to you on\r\n   the subject of the enterprise of our squadron against three\r\n   ships of the line and a frigate, at anchor in Algeziras Bay,\r\n   last Monday; for a more particular account of which I must refer\r\n   you to my public letter. But as my friends, with their usual\r\n   anxiety on my account, will naturally wish further information\r\n   from me, I must assure them in justice to myself and for their\r\n   satisfaction, that everything was done that depended on myself,\r\n   both in the planning and executing the business; but I cannot be\r\n   accountable for the accidents that prevented its success. Even\r\n   within an hour from our first engaging, and before any of our\r\n   ships had sustained much injury, the Pompee, which was\r\n   remarkably well placed against the inner ship, which proved to\r\n   be the French Admiral, had at one time nearly silenced her, and\r\n   must have done so in less than ten minutes, had not an\r\n   unfortunate flaw of wind _broke her sheer_; and from that moment\r\n   she was unable to bring one of her guns to bear on the enemy's\r\n   ship.\r\n\r\n   A short time after, the Hannibal got a fine breeze of wind, and\r\n   was lying up in the handsomest manner for the French ship; but\r\n   unfortunately, wishing to go between her and the shore, got\r\n   aground. Surely in either of these instances I was not\r\n   concerned.\r\n\r\n   I had, before this, cut our cables, to profit by a favourable\r\n   breeze to close the other two ships; but before we got near them\r\n   it failed us, as well as the Audacious, and with the current we\r\n   drove close to the island battery, where we remained a\r\n   considerable time before either of the ships could clear a shoal\r\n   close to it. At length a fine breeze sprung up, which gave the\r\n   most favourable hope of carrying us close to the enemy's ships,\r\n   and, by silencing them, to extricate the unfortunate Hannibal.\r\n\r\n   But here, again, it most unhappily failed us; and although we\r\n   had, at different times, opened a heavy fire upon them, we were\r\n   still not sufficiently near to silence them effectually; and,\r\n   the wind all the time leading us farther off, I was constrained\r\n   to abandon all hopes of success, and proceeded with the squadron\r\n   to this anchorage.\r\n\r\n   The Superb yesterday joined us, with the Thames. Captain Keats,\r\n   having seen the enemy coming out of Cadiz, appeared with the\r\n   signal of their being in sight, and they soon after came round\r\n   Cabrita Point. Two are three-deckers, and three are\r\n   seventy-fours, with three frigates. If it draws this force to\r\n   the Mediterranean, some good may come from it. A squadron is\r\n   hourly expected from Lord Keith, and probably some ships may\r\n   soon join us from England. We shall have all the ships in\r\n   readiness; and the junction of a few ships, would make us again\r\n   superior to the enemy's force. I must not forget to mention\r\n   that Captain Brenton has shown himself a brave and most able\r\n   officer.\r\n\r\n   It is with difficulty I have found a leisure moment to write\r\n   this. All I request of my friends is, to feel assured that the\r\n   failure of this enterprise has in no instance proceeded from\r\n   myself; and every one is ready to acknowledge that I did, in\r\n   every respect, all that depended on me. This, you will perceive,\r\n   is written in the midst of much bustle and a most active scene.\r\n\r\nThe despatches contained accounts of the arrival of the Spanish\r\nsquadron, and of Sir James's determination to attack them if they\r\nattempted to put to sea, even with the force under his command. He\r\nalso sent despatches to Lisbon to delay any convoys which might be\r\nsailing; and to Lord Keith, in the Mediterranean, to inform his\r\nlordship of all the circumstances we have related. The Plymouth lugger\r\nhad already sailed, the wind being fair, with Captain Ferris, who, as\r\nwell as Lieutenant Hills, were bearers of the interesting details.\r\n\r\nThe intense interest which these circumstances created on the Rock of\r\nGibraltar is far beyond description; nor do we know whether the kind\r\nand sympathising reception which the suffering heroes met with on\r\ntheir return from Algeziras was more worthy of praise than the\r\nunparalleled exertions made to renew the conflict. On the one hand,\r\nhad the squadron arrived after the most complete and glorious victory,\r\nthey could not have been received in a manner more gratifying to\r\ntheir feelings; while, on the other hand, it was evident that every\r\nman was worthy of such generous and such noble conduct.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the governor, the garrison, and the inhabitants,\r\nalthough themselves in a state of privation, was unremitting. We shall\r\nleave them for the present preparing to take farewell of each other on\r\nthe evening before the Admiral's departure, to meet what must have\r\nappeared to every spectator an overwhelming foe!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n1801.\r\n\r\n     Occurrences at Gibraltar.--Determination of Sir James to attack\r\n     the combined squadron.--Caesar rehoists the Admiral's flag.--Sir\r\n     J. Brenton's description of that interesting scene.--His\r\n     account of the battle.--Destruction of two Spanish\r\n     three-deckers.--Capture of the St. Antonio.--Action between the\r\n     Venerable and Formidable.--Public letters.--Private\r\n     letters.--French details of the battle.--Spanish ditto.--Orders\r\n     of sailing.--Remarks.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral O'Hara the gallant governor, and the brave garrison of\r\nGibraltar, had beheld from the Rock, which is only four miles from\r\nAlgeziras, the long-contested, severe, but unfortunate conflict of the\r\n6th of July. They had witnessed the bravery of their countrymen. Their\r\nintense anxiety for the success of the Admiral's daring attack had\r\nbeen changed into sympathy for the loss his squadron had sustained;\r\nand, fully convinced that not only no honour had been sacrificed, but\r\nthat the character of the nation had been gloriously maintained, the\r\nunsuccessful were received at the Rock, as if they had returned from a\r\nvictory. The garrison beheld with admiration the wonderful efforts\r\nwhich were made to meet a still more formidable foe. Every day marked\r\nthe progress of the Herculean labours in preparation for that event;\r\nthe exertions, zeal, and intrepidity of Sir James's officers and crews\r\nincreased in proportion to the multiplied force of the enemy, which,\r\nto men of any other cast, would have appeared overwhelming!\r\n\r\nAfter one of the severest engagements on record, the British squadron,\r\nin the short space of five days, had repaired its damages, and sought\r\nthe enemy, whose force had been nearly tripled by the junction of six\r\nships and three frigates from Cadiz. With such men, and in such a\r\ncause, victory seemed certain, notwithstanding the great disparity of\r\nforce between the belligerents, and the exertions of the enemy proved,\r\nthat he expected a tremendous struggle. Every circumstance contributed\r\nto render the approaching contest more eventful. Their late\r\nunsuccessful attack only served to animate the officers and crews with\r\na noble enthusiasm, and a desire to put their valour to another but a\r\nfairer trial; and they well knew that their Admiral would lead them to\r\nthe combat with that consummate skill, and deliberate courage which\r\nhad so justly rendered his name illustrious.\r\n\r\nAt length the moment arrived. The enemy, whose force almost tripled\r\nthat of the English, were seen under sail; the wind was fair, and the\r\nweather fine. The Caesar, having rehoisted the Admiral's flag, made the\r\nsignal to prepare for battle!\r\n\r\nFor a description of the intensely interesting and animating scene\r\nwhich followed, we gladly avail ourselves of a communication kindly\r\nmade to us by Sir Jahleel Brenton, the gallant captain of the Caesar on\r\nthat memorable occasion.\r\n\r\n\"12th July 1801.--At daylight the enemy were seen making every\r\npreparation for sailing; and in the course of the forenoon were\r\ngetting under way, and working out of the bay with a fresh wind from\r\nthe eastward. As they required to make several tacks for this purpose,\r\nit was past one o'clock before the headmost ships could clear Cabrita\r\nPoint, when they brought to, to wait for the others to join them.\r\n\r\n\"At half-past two the Caesar hauled out of the Mole, her band playing\r\n\"Cheer up my lads, 'tis to glory we steer!\" which was answered by the\r\nmilitary band on the Mole-head with \"Britons, strike home!\" At the\r\nsame moment the Admiral's flag was rehoisted on board the Caesar; and\r\nsail being made upon her, she weighed amidst the deafening cheers and\r\nacclamations of the garrison, and the whole assembled population,\r\ncarrying with her the sincerest and most ardent wishes for victory.\r\n\r\n\"She took her station off Europa Point, with the signals for her\r\nlittle squadron to close round her, and to prepare for battle.[38] We\r\nthen returned the salute which had been fired by the garrison on\r\nentering the bay on the 6th; and which, in consequence of being\r\nimmediately engaged with the enemy, we could not do at the time. It\r\nwas delightful during this and the preceding days to witness the calm,\r\nbut decided manner of the admiral. He had evidently calculated the\r\nawful responsibility under which he was placed; and this, at the same\r\ntime, was self-imposed; for it was by no means incumbent on him as a\r\nduty, with only five sail of the line, viz. the Caesar, Superb,\r\nSpencer, Venerable, and Audacious, to attack an enemy with six fresh\r\nships, of which number two mounted one hundred and twelve guns each,\r\none of ninety, and three of seventy-four, in addition to the three\r\nFrench ships we had already engaged, and their prize, the Hannibal.\r\nBut our chief had counted the cost, and made up his mind to the\r\nenterprise. His intention was to throw his whole force upon whatever\r\npart of the enemy's line he might be able to reach; depending upon the\r\ntalents of his captains, and the discipline of his ships, to make up\r\nfor the disparity of force, especially in a night action.\r\n\r\n   [38] While off Europa point, and probably at the distance of\r\n   more than half a mile, a boat with two men was observed\r\n   pulling towards us, and, on coming alongside, the men proved\r\n   to be two of our own people, who had been wounded in the\r\n   action of Algeziras, and sent to the hospital at Gibraltar. On\r\n   seeing the ship under sail, with the evident intention of\r\n   attacking the enemy, these gallant fellows asked permission of\r\n   the surgeon to rejoin their ship, and being refused, on\r\n   account of their apparent unfitness, they made their escape\r\n   from the hospital, and taking possession of the first boat\r\n   they could find, pulled off to the ship.\r\n\r\n   Two other seamen belonging to the Pompee, who had not been\r\n   selected as part of the reinforcement to the crews of the other\r\n   ships, secreted themselves on board the Caesar, and the day after\r\n   the action presented themselves on the quarter-deck, with a\r\n   request that intercession might be made for them with their\r\n   captain, telling their story in the following quaint\r\n   manner:--\"Sir, we belongs to the Le Pompee, and finding our ship\r\n   could not get out, we stowed ourselves away in this ship, and,\r\n   in the action, quartered ourselves to the \"10th gun, and\r\n   opposite ---- on the lower deck,\" referring, at the same time, to\r\n   the officer in command of this division of guns, for the truth\r\n   of their statement.\r\n\r\n\"The squadron was soon assembled off Europa, and we beheld that of the\r\nenemy forming their line off Cabrita, about five miles to leeward,\r\nwaiting for the Hannibal, which was the last ship to leave Algeziras.\r\nSir James now made the interrogatory signal to know if all the ships\r\nwere ready for battle, which was most properly answered in the\r\nnegative, as all had much to do. The time which the combined squadron\r\ntook to get into the order of battle and sailing was invaluable to all\r\nof us, by enabling us to complete the arrangements so necessary upon\r\nso momentous an occasion. At length, every ship having announced her\r\nreadiness for action, the Admiral made the signal for them to be\r\nprepared to follow his motions. He had already communicated with his\r\ncaptains his plan of attack, and no other signal was made, or was\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\"_At eight o'clock_ the Hannibal, unable to work out of the Bay, was\r\nobserved to anchor again at Algeziras, and the enemy bore up through\r\nthe Straits; the Caesar's helm was instantly put up, a blue light being\r\nburned at the same time for the squadron to follow. At 8h. 40m. the\r\nSuperb was gaining fast upon us, and the Admiral ordered me to hail\r\nCaptain Keats, directing him to engage the ship nearest to the Spanish\r\nshore. The enemy was retreating in two lines abreast, thus:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n(Representation of illustration follows)\r\n\r\n             S\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               H\r\n\r\n           2   3   4\r\n\r\n     5   6   7   8   9   10\r\n\r\nthe three French ships in the van, the Spanish squadron in the rear.\r\nHad the Hannibal succeeded in getting out of the bay, she was to have\r\ntaken the station ahead of the French ships, at the place marked with\r\na cross H, in order to put her in the greatest security, and to\r\npreserve their trophy.\r\n\r\n\"At five minutes past eleven the Superb opened her fire; and, very\r\nshortly after, the two sternmost ships of the enemy were seen to be in\r\nflames. We were rapidly approaching them, and orders had been sent\r\ndown to the officers at their quarters to fire as soon as the guns\r\nwould bear.\r\n\r\n\"I was at this time standing on the poop ladder, near the Admiral,\r\nwhen he seized me by the shoulder, and, pointing to the flames\r\nbursting out, exclaimed, 'My God, sir, look there! the day is ours!' A\r\nmore magnificent scene never presented itself, as may be easily\r\nimagined, than two ships of such immense magnitude as the Spanish\r\nfirst-rates, on board of each other in flames, with a fresh gale, the\r\nsea running high, and their sails in the utmost confusion. The flames,\r\nascending the rigging with the rapidity of lightning, soon\r\ncommunicated to the canvass, which instantly became one sheet of fire.\r\nA very general feeling of regret and sympathy seemed to be quickly\r\nexperienced around us when we beheld the Spanish colours brilliantly\r\nilluminated by the dreadful conflagration, instead of the French. The\r\nunfortunate Spaniards, having become at once the tools and the victims\r\nof France, were objects of our sincere commiseration.\r\n\r\n\"The Superb was now seen a little way on the starboard bow, engaged\r\nwith one of the enemy's ships, while several others were in sight at a\r\ndistance ahead. We kept on our course, and after having fired a\r\nbroadside into the Superb's opponent, (which, however, was already\r\nnearly silenced), continued the chase, followed by the Venerable; but,\r\nwhen nearly the length of Trafalgar, our wounded masts complained so\r\nmuch, that we were under the necessity of close-reefing the\r\nmain-top-sail, and taking in the fore-top-sail. The Admiral was also\r\nanxious to get his squadron round him, that he might, with his\r\ncollected force, reach Cadiz before the morning, and cut the enemy off\r\nfrom the only port in which they could find security.\r\n\r\n\"The easterly wind, which, although blowing with great violence in the\r\nStraits, is seldom felt close in shore on either the Spanish or\r\nAfrican coasts, entirely failed us as we hauled round Cape Trafalgar,\r\nand left our ship rolling heavily in the swell, to the great danger of\r\nour masts. At half-past twelve o'clock one of the Spanish\r\nthree-deckers blew up, with a tremendous explosion, and soon after the\r\nother. They had previously separated, after their masts had fallen,\r\nand the rigging was consumed; and they were seen for some time\r\nburning at a distance from each other, before their fatal termination.\r\n\r\n\"As the Admiral and myself were looking over the chart together, in\r\norder to shape our course for Cadiz, we heard an alarming cry of\r\n'Fire!' and, running out upon deck, were enveloped in a thick\r\nsulphrueous smoke, which seemed to pervade every part of the ship.\r\nSoon, however, we found it clear away, and ascertained the cause to\r\nbe, that we had run into the column of smoke and vapour arising from\r\nthe explosion of the Spanish ship, which, being too dense to rise, lay\r\nalong the surface of the water. We gradually emerged from this, and\r\nwere relieved from our apprehensions of sharing the fate of our\r\nunhappy enemies.\r\n\r\n\"At the dawn of day we saw the Venerable close to a French\r\nline-of-battle ship, and drawing up with her by the aid of a light air\r\noff the Spanish shore. At five o'clock the Venerable opened her fire\r\nupon the enemy. The breeze dying away, the two ships were enveloped in\r\na cloud of smoke. The Caesar, at the distance of about a mile and a\r\nhalf, was perfectly becalmed. The boats were sent ahead, in hopes of\r\nbeing able to tow her within gun-shot of the enemy. In the course of a\r\nshort time, a light breeze having dispersed the dense cloud of smoke\r\nwhich the fire of the two ships had occasioned, we discovered the\r\nVenerable with her main-mast gone, and her opponent availing herself\r\nof the air from the eastward to draw away, and pursue her course for\r\nCadiz, firing her stern-chasers at the Venerable. The remainder of the\r\nenemy's squadron, consisting of five sail of the line and one frigate,\r\nin which both the French and Spanish admirals were embarked, were\r\ndiscerned in the N.W., at a considerable distance, coming down with a\r\nwesterly wind.\r\n\r\n\"The Superb having secured the prize, was approaching us from the\r\nS.E., and the Spencer and Audacious were also to the southward. Such\r\nwas the relative situation of the squadrons, when, at eight minutes\r\npast eight, the Venerable made the signal of having struck on a shoal.\r\nThe Admiral, very apprehensive of her falling into the hands of the\r\nenemy, sent me with discretional orders to Captain Hood, that, should\r\nhe not be able to get her off the shoal, he might put his men into the\r\nThames, and burn the Venerable, making the signal at the same time for\r\nthe Thames to close with the Venerable as soon as possible. I had\r\nscarcely left the Caesar when I saw the Venerable's fore-mast go over\r\nthe side; and before I reached her the mizen-mast followed. I found\r\nher, on going on board, a perfect wreck, striking on the shoal, and\r\nthe shot from the stern-chase guns of the Formidable, her opponent,\r\ngoing over her. The gallant Hood was seated on a gun on the\r\nquarter-deck, cheerfully waiting for the assistance which he knew the\r\nAdmiral would send to him as soon as the wind would enable him, and\r\nready to take advantage of any circumstance that might occur.\r\n\r\n\"Having delivered my message from the Admiral, he said, 'Tell Sir\r\nJames I hope it is not yet so bad with the old Venerable; I hope to\r\nget her off soon. Let the Thames stay by me, in readiness to receive\r\nour people. These rascals shall not have her.' I returned to my ship;\r\nthe breeze sprung up; and the Thames closing with the Venerable,\r\nenabled her to heave off the shoal, and the enemy availed himself of\r\nthe wind to get into Cadiz. The Venerable was soon under jury-masts\r\nand in tow of the Spencer, steering for Gibraltar, followed by the\r\nrest of the squadron; where we all anchored, with our prize, the San\r\nAntonio, of seventy-four guns, at 6 P.M. on the 14th.\r\n\r\n\"The scene before us, on anchoring, was of the most animating\r\ndescription. Every point of the Rock overhanging the shore was crowded\r\nwith people, and the acclamations of the troops and inhabitants which\r\nrent the air resounded throughout the bay! Here, indeed, was a triumph\r\nfor our hero, who, only a week before, had been towed in from\r\nAlgeziras with his crippled and defeated squadron, with the loss of a\r\nship of the line; but now entering victorious with the same squadron,\r\nreinforced, it is true, by the Superb, but diminished by the loss of\r\nthe Hannibal, while the disabled state of the Pompee had prevented\r\nher leaving Gibraltar; after having engaged and defeated an enemy of\r\nmore than double his force, and having burnt two of their first-rates,\r\nand taken from them a ship of the line.\r\n\r\n\"From the nature of the attack and retreat, there was not much hard\r\nfighting on this occasion, and consequently little opportunity for any\r\ndisplay of that valour and skill which is so constantly manifested in\r\nsevere actions. The Superb and Venerable had the greatest, and almost\r\nthe only share. But the conduct of the Admiral, I will venture to say,\r\nwhen all the circumstances are taken into consideration, must be\r\ndeemed fully equal to anything that has adorned the pages of England's\r\nnaval history. Instead of the recklessness of despair, to which some\r\nmight have attributed an attack with crippled ships against a force\r\nevery way so greatly superior, he manifested a calm and resolute\r\ndetermination. His intentions were expressed with so much clearness\r\nthat, as I have already observed, signals were rendered unnecessary.\r\nHe waited with much patience and firmness for the enemy to bear up,\r\nwhich would place them in a situation the least favourable for\r\nresisting a simultaneous attack upon any portion of their squadron.\r\n\r\n\"When the governor, the garrison, and the inhabitants of Gibraltar,\r\nwho had passed the night with painful anxiety beheld the approach of\r\nthe victorious squadron, their joy and exultation knew no bounds.\r\nEven the wounded at the hospitals, when they heard of the glorious\r\nsuccess which had attended their brethren in arms, raising their\r\nstumps, joined in the general burst of acclamation. On the arrival of\r\nthe Caesar, the royal standard was hoisted, twenty-one guns were fired\r\nat the King's Bastion, and the whole of this noble fortress was\r\nbrilliantly illuminated in honour of the victory.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the termination of this contest,--a contest which may be said to\r\nhave lasted seven days, in which two battles had been fought under\r\npeculiar disadvantages, and which ended in adding another brilliant\r\nray to the naval glory of Britain,--Sir James, with that humility\r\nwhich had ever formed a distinguished feature in his character,\r\nreturned thanks to the great Giver of all victory for crowning his\r\nexertions with success.\r\n\r\nThe following general memorandum was given out to the squadron, on\r\ntheir return to Gibraltar:\r\n\r\n   Caesar, Rosia Bay, 15th July 1801.\r\n\r\n   Rear-admiral Sir James Saumarez has the happiness to offer his\r\n   most heartfelt congratulations to the captains, officers, and\r\n   men of the ships he had the honour to command, on the signal\r\n   success with which it has pleased Almighty God to crown their\r\n   zealous exertions in the service of their country. To the\r\n   discipline and valour of British seamen is to be ascribed their\r\n   great superiority over the enemy, who, although more than\r\n   triple the force of the English squadron in number of guns and\r\n   weight of metal, have been so signally defeated.\r\n\r\n   The Rear-admiral has not failed to transmit in his late\r\n   despatches a report of the unparalleled exertions of all the\r\n   officers and men in refitting his Majesty's ships after the\r\n   battle of Algeziras, where their conduct and bravery were\r\n   equally conspicuous, and which has led to the late glorious\r\n   success.\r\n\r\n   JAS. SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n   To the respective Captains, &c.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Dumaresq, of the Caesar, was now despatched in the Louisa\r\nbrig to England, with the following official accounts of the action\r\nfrom the Rear-admiral, and from Captains Keats and Hood:\r\n\r\n   Caesar, off Cape Trafalgar, 13th July 1801.\r\n\r\n   SIR,\r\n\r\n   I request you will please to inform my Lords Commissioners of\r\n   the Admiralty that it has pleased the Almighty to crown the\r\n   exertions of this squadron with the most signal success over the\r\n   enemies of their country.\r\n\r\n   The three French line-of-battle ships disabled in the action of\r\n   the 6th instant off Algeziras, were, on the 8th, reinforced by a\r\n   squadron of five Spanish line-of-battle ships, under the command\r\n   of Don Juan Joaquin de Moreno, and a French ship of seventy-four\r\n   guns, wearing a broad pendant; besides three frigates, and an\r\n   incredible number of gun-boats and other vessels; and got under\r\n   sail yesterday morning, together with his Majesty's late ship\r\n   Hannibal, which they had succeeded in getting off the shoal on\r\n   which she struck.\r\n\r\n   I almost despaired of having a sufficient force in readiness to\r\n   oppose to such numbers; but, through the great exertions of\r\n   Captain Brenton, and the officers and men belonging to the\r\n   Caesar, the ship was in readiness to warp out of the Mole\r\n   yesterday morning, and got under way immediately after, with all\r\n   the squadron except the Pompee, which ship had not had time to\r\n   get her masts in.\r\n\r\n   Confiding in the zeal and intrepidity of the officers and men I\r\n   had the happiness to serve with, I determined, if possible, to\r\n   obstruct the passage of this powerful force to Cadiz. Late in\r\n   the evening I observed the enemy's ships to have cleared Cabrita\r\n   Point; and, at eight, I bore up with the squadron to stand after\r\n   them. His Majesty's ship Superb being stationed ahead of the\r\n   Caesar, I directed Captain Keats to make sail and attack the\r\n   sternmost ships of the enemy's rear, using his endeavours to\r\n   keep in-shore of them.\r\n\r\n   At eleven, the Superb opened her fire close to the enemy's\r\n   ships; and, on the Caesar's coming up and preparing to engage a\r\n   three-decker that had hauled her wind, she was perceived to have\r\n   taken fire; and the flames having communicated to a ship to\r\n   leeward of her, both were soon in a blaze, and presented a most\r\n   awful sight. As no possibility existed of affording the least\r\n   assistance in so distressing a situation, the Caesar passed, to\r\n   close with the ship engaged by the Superb; but, by the cool and\r\n   determined fire kept up on her, which must ever reflect the\r\n   highest credit on the discipline of that ship, she was\r\n   completely silenced, and soon after hauled down her colours.\r\n\r\n   The Venerable and Spencer having at this time come up, I bore up\r\n   after the enemy, who were carrying a press of sail, standing out\r\n   of the Straits; and lost sight of them. During the night it blew\r\n   excessively hard till daylight, and, in the morning, the only\r\n   ships in company were the Venerable and Thames, ahead of the\r\n   Caesar, and one of the French ships at some distance from them,\r\n   standing towards the shoals of Conil, besides the Spencer\r\n   astern, coming up.\r\n\r\n   All the ships immediately made sail with a fresh breeze, but, as\r\n   we approached, the wind suddenly failing, the Venerable was\r\n   alone able to bring her to action; which Captain Hood did in the\r\n   most gallant manner, and had nearly silenced the French ship,\r\n   when his main-mast (which had been before wounded) was\r\n   unfortunately shot away, and, it coming nearly calm, the enemy's\r\n   ship was enabled to get off without any possibility of following\r\n   her. The highest praise is due to Captain Hood, the officers,\r\n   and men of the Venerable, for their spirit and gallantry in this\r\n   action, which entitled them to better success. The French ship\r\n   was an eighty-four, with additional guns on the gunwale. This\r\n   action was so near the shore that the Venerable struck on one of\r\n   the shoals; but was soon after got off, and taken in tow by the\r\n   Thames, though with the loss of all her masts.\r\n\r\n   The enemy's ships are now in sight to the westward, standing in\r\n   for Cadiz; the Superb and Audacious, with the captured ship, are\r\n   in sight, with the Carlotta, Portuguese frigate, commanded by\r\n   Captain Crawford Duncan, who very handsomely came out with the\r\n   squadron, and has been of the greatest assistance to Captain\r\n   Keats in staying by the enemy's ship captured by the Superb.\r\n\r\n   I am proceeding with the squadron for Rosia Bay, and shall\r\n   proceed, the moment all the ships are refitted, to resume my\r\n   station before Cadiz; and shall immediately detach the Thames to\r\n   cruise off Cape St. Mary's.\r\n\r\n   No praises that I can bestow are adequate to the merits of the\r\n   officers and ships' companies of all the squadron, particularly\r\n   for their unremitted exertions in refitting the ships at\r\n   Gibraltar; to which, in a great degree, is to be ascribed the\r\n   success of the squadron against the enemy.\r\n\r\n   Although the Spencer and Audacious had not the good fortune to\r\n   partake of this action, I have no doubt of their exertion, had\r\n   they come up in time to close with the enemy's ships.\r\n\r\n   My thanks are also due to Captain Holles of the Thames, and to\r\n   the Honourable Captain Dundas of the Calpe, whose assistance was\r\n   particularly useful to Captain Keats in securing the enemy's\r\n   ship, and enabling the Superb to stand after the squadron in\r\n   case of being enabled to renew the action with the enemy.\r\n\r\n   I have the honour to be, sir,\r\n   Your most obedient humble servant,\r\n   JAS. SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n   To Evan Nepean, Esq. &c. &c. &c. Admiralty.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Caesar, off Cape Trafalgar, 14th July 1801.\r\n\r\n   SIR,\r\n\r\n   I herewith enclose, for their lordships' further information,\r\n   the statement I have received from Captain Keats, to whom the\r\n   greatest praise is due for his gallant conduct in the service\r\n   alluded to. Captain Hood's merits are held in too high\r\n   estimation to receive additional lustre from any praise I can\r\n   bestow; but I only do justice to my feelings, when I observe\r\n   that in no instance have I known superior bravery to that\r\n   displayed by him on this occasion.\r\n\r\n   I have the honour to be, sir,\r\n   Your most obedient servant,\r\n   JAS. SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n   To Evan Nepean, Esq. Admiralty.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Superb, off Cape Trafalgar, 13th July 1801.\r\n\r\n   SIR,\r\n\r\n   Pursuant to your directions to state the particulars of the\r\n   Superb's services last night, I have the honour to inform you\r\n   that, in consequence of your directions to make sail up to, and\r\n   engage, the sternmost of the enemy's ships, at half-past eleven\r\n   I found myself abreast of a Spanish three-deck ship, (the Real\r\n   Carlos, as appears by the report of some survivors,) which,\r\n   having been brought with two other ships, in nearly line\r\n   abreast, I opened my fire upon them at not more than three\r\n   cables' lengths. This evidently produced a good effect, as well\r\n   in this ship as the others abreast of her, which soon began\r\n   firing at each other, and, at times, on the Superb. In about a\r\n   quarter of an hour, I perceived the ship I was engaging, and\r\n   which had lost her fore-top-mast, to be on fire; upon which we\r\n   ceased to molest her; and I proceeded on to the ship next at\r\n   hand, which proved to be the San Antonio, of seventy-four guns\r\n   and seven hundred and thirty men, commanded by Chef-de-division\r\n   Le Ray, under French colours, wearing a broad pendant, and\r\n   manned, nearly equally, with seven hundred and thirty French and\r\n   Spanish seamen, and which, after some action, (the chef being\r\n   wounded,) struck her colours.\r\n\r\n   I learn, from the very few survivors of the ships that caught\r\n   fire and blew up, who, in an open boat, reached the Superb at\r\n   the time she was taking possession of the San Antonio, that, in\r\n   the confusion of the action, the Hermenegildo, (a first-rate\r\n   ship,) mistaking the Real Carlos for an enemy, ran on board of\r\n   her, and shared her melancholy fate. Services of this nature\r\n   cannot well be expected to be performed without some loss; but\r\n   though we have to lament that Lieutenant Edward Waller, and\r\n   fourteen seamen and marines, have been mostly severely wounded,\r\n   still there is reason to rejoice that that is the extent of our\r\n   loss. I received able and active assistance from Mr. Samuel\r\n   Jackson, the first lieutenant; and it is my duty to represent to\r\n   you that the officers of all descriptions, seamen and marines,\r\n   conducted themselves with the greatest steadiness and gallantry.\r\n\r\n   I have the honour to be, sir,\r\n   Your most obedient humble servant,\r\n   R.G.

Commodore\r\nLe Ray, of the San Antonio, was wounded; but his loss in men, which\r\nmust have been severe, has not been ascertained.\r\n\r\nWe shall here give some interesting extracts from private letters from\r\nSir James, written at the close of the battle:\r\n\r\n   Caesar, 13th July 1801, 8 A.M.\r\n\r\n   I shall leave you to judge of the difference of my feelings to\r\n   those when I sat down to write the letter of this day week.[39]\r\n   To an all-merciful PROVIDENCE is to be ascribed the wonderful\r\n   and most awful event of last night, which will ever be\r\n   remembered with terror by the nations it concerned, and by me\r\n   with infinite gratitude for so peculiar a token of Divine mercy\r\n   vouchsafed towards me.\r\n\r\n   [39] See page 388.\r\n\r\n   Two days after the action of last Monday, a strong squadron was\r\n   sent to Algeziras from Cadiz, to protect the disabled French\r\n   ships, and to convoy them to the latter port, with the Hannibal,\r\n   which ship they had succeeded in getting off the shoal whereon\r\n   she had unfortunately grounded. It may be supposed that no\r\n   exertion was wanting on my part to get the squadron in a state\r\n   for service; and, beyond all expectation, owing to the great\r\n   activity and zeal of every officer and man in the squadron, we\r\n   were in a state to put to sea yesterday, on the enemy's getting\r\n   under sail from the Bay of Algeziras; the Pompee excepted, which\r\n   had not sufficient time to get in new masts.\r\n\r\n   Late in the evening I observed that the enemy's ships,\r\n   consisting of ten sail of the line and four frigates, had\r\n   succeeded in clearing the bay; and at eight o'clock I made sail\r\n   after them. Captain Keats, who, in the Superb, had been much\r\n   mortified at not having shared in the former affair, being near\r\n   the Caesar, I directed him to endeavour to bring the rear ships\r\n   of the enemy to action; myself following with the Venerable, and\r\n   the other two ships, some distance astern.\r\n\r\n   It was near midnight when the Superb succeeded in engaging the\r\n   enemy; and, as we came up, a three-deck ship hauling up for us\r\n   after having fired at the Superb, by some accident, in the\r\n   moment we were going to give her our broadside, took fire, which\r\n   communicating to a ship which we perceived close to her, both\r\n   were almost instantly in a blaze. So awful a scene I never yet\r\n   have witnessed. We then closed with the Superb, which had nearly\r\n   silenced her opponent, when she struck.\r\n\r\n   Think what a change then took place in the inequality of force\r\n   with which we began the action! I left the Superb to take care\r\n   of the prize, and proceeded after the other ships; the Audacious\r\n   and Spencer having now joined. It came on to blow excessively\r\n   hard till daylight, when I found the Venerable and Thames a\r\n   small distance ahead, and one of the French ships standing for\r\n   the shore. We immediately crowded all sail, and made sure of\r\n   taking her, when the wind failed us, and the Venerable only was\r\n   able to engage her; but, being at the time close to the shore,\r\n   she very unfortunately got aground, and we were obliged to leave\r\n   her, after sustaining very great damage.\r\n\r\n   We are now about seven leagues from Cadiz, and I see the\r\n   remainder of the enemy's squadron going into port. I am as yet\r\n   ignorant of the ship's name that struck her colours last night.\r\n   She is, however, one of those that came from Cadiz with the\r\n   Spanish squadron, but under French colours, and had a broad\r\n   pendant. We are proceeding to Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nThe following extract is from a letter to Richard Saumarez, Esq.:\r\n\r\n   Caesar, off Cadiz, 13th July 1801.\r\n\r\n   I intend to send Phil. D. with my despatches. You must refer to\r\n   him for the particulars of the wonderful events since yesterday.\r\n\r\nAfter detailing these events exactly as in the above, he adds,\r\nrespecting the Venerable:\r\n\r\n   It was as severe an action as I have known, and must reflect the\r\n   highest credit on Captain Hood; but having his main-mast shot\r\n   away, and it falling nearly calm, he was obliged to leave the\r\n   enemy. We were at this time close to the shoals off the coast,\r\n   on which the Venerable got aground; but she was afterwards got\r\n   off, and was taken in tow by the Thames. I fear she has\r\n   sustained great loss in men. What a surprising change, my dear\r\n   Richard, to the events of last Monday! To the Divine mercy I\r\n   entirely ascribe this signal success, who never forsakes those\r\n   who place their confidence in him! I mean to send the Louisa,\r\n   which joined me yesterday from Minorca, with Phil. Dumaresq, and\r\n   doubt not but he will be a welcome messenger. We see the\r\n   remainder of the enemy's squadron. They are standing for Cadiz,\r\n   &c.\r\n\r\nSir James subsequently wrote to his eldest brother, residing in\r\nGuernsey; and, as his letter will be found to contain additional\r\nmatter of much interest, we herewith insert it.\r\n\r\n   Caesar, Gibraltar, 16th July 1801.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n   I hope that the several letters I have had the pleasure of\r\n   writing to you at different opportunities, will arrive safely;\r\n   and that you and all my friends will not be kept in suspense on\r\n   events which, thanks to the Divine Providence! have terminated\r\n   so successfully to the squadron. Although I always trusted some\r\n   favourable turn would take place, I never could have formed any\r\n   hopes equal to what has actually occurred. The possession of one\r\n   or two of the disabled ships, besides the recovery of the\r\n   Hannibal, was the utmost that could have been expected; but our\r\n   present success far exceeds that. The destruction of two\r\n   first-rates, and the capture of a seventy-four, completely\r\n   cripples the force in Cadiz, and places the squadron with me\r\n   superior to all the force the enemy can collect; and this,\r\n   without any loss whatever to this ship, and trifling to the\r\n   Superb. The men, wounded on board the latter, suffered from the\r\n   explosion of cartridges in their own ship.\r\n\r\n   The misfortune to the Venerable was more serious; but this was\r\n   subsequently to the attack on the enemy's force, and was mainly\r\n   attributable to the untoward circumstance of the wind failing\r\n   this ship when we were very close to her.\r\n\r\n   It is inconceivable the _eclat_ with which we have been received\r\n   by this garrison, and the distinguished honours paid to the\r\n   squadron; indeed their marked attention, after the attack of\r\n   Algeziras, does them great credit; as, after the failure of that\r\n   business, we exposed Gibraltar to all the inconvenience of a\r\n   blockaded port; and yet the whole garrison received us as if we\r\n   had obtained a victory. You must suppose my distress must have\r\n   been great during the interval: convoys long expected were\r\n   liable to fall into the enemy's hands, whilst the increasing\r\n   force at Cadiz would soon have put it out of my power to cope\r\n   with them.\r\n\r\n   The St. Antoine has scarcely suffered: my intention is to take\r\n   her into the service; and in two weeks, I expect, she will be\r\n   partly manned, and fit for sea. Yesterday, almost all the\r\n   Hannibal's men were sent in, which will make up our\r\n   deficiencies, and partly man that ship, when in a fortnight she\r\n   shall proceed on a particular service.\r\n\r\n   These are trifling advantages compared to those that result from\r\n   both actions. The three ships were to have proceeded direct to\r\n   the Bay of Casquays, at the entrance of the Tagus, where the\r\n   troops with them were to have taken possession of the batteries,\r\n   which would have given them complete possession of the trade to\r\n   and from Lisbon. I have despatched the Spencer and Audacious,\r\n   and shall join them with this ship, the Pompee, and Superb, the\r\n   first easterly wind, and cruise before Cadiz with this force,\r\n   far superior to any the enemy can put to sea. I shall soon be\r\n   joined by ships from England.\r\n\r\n   We have, as yet, no accounts since we sailed. You will have the\r\n   pleasure of mentioning to the relations of the young men I have,\r\n   that they have all behaved most nobly, and are perfectly well:\r\n   it is a particular circumstance that, out of six ships, three\r\n   masters should have been killed, and not one lieutenant hurt out\r\n   of the whole number.\r\n\r\n   I hope the benevolence of the public will be extended to the\r\n   sufferers in these actions: some are piteous objects; indeed, no\r\n   less than three brave men with the loss of both arms.\r\n\r\n   I send this by a vessel belonging to Jersey.\r\n   My dear brother, most sincerely yours,\r\n   JAS. SAUMAREZ.\r\n\r\n   John Saumarez, Esq. Guernsey.\r\n\r\n   P.S.--I am under great concern at the uneasiness you must all\r\n   suffer at our unsuccessful attack off Algeziras; but this will,\r\n   I hope, soon remove it. Messrs. Le Mesurier, jointly with Mr.\r\n   Tucker, Lord St. Vincent's secretary, are appointed agents.\r\n\r\nThe following letter to Lady Saumarez is dated 17th July, on board the\r\nCaesar, at Gibraltar; and gives a detailed account of his proceedings\r\nafter his arrival there.\r\n\r\n   Since our arrival here on Tuesday afternoon, every distinguished\r\n   attention which can be thought of has been paid to the squadron.\r\n   The day following, the royal standard was hoisted; at noon the\r\n   garrison saluted; and, in the evening, the most splendid\r\n   illuminations took place in every habitable part of this famous\r\n   Rock. Yesterday the governor gave a dinner, and he intends to\r\n   invite the ladies to a ball on this occasion. We have, also,\r\n   invitations from the different corps for every day we are likely\r\n   to remain here: but what has afforded me more satisfaction, is\r\n   the manner we were received after the attack of Algeziras,\r\n   which, from the arrival of the Spanish squadron, subjected the\r\n   garrison to every inconvenience of a port blockaded. The St.\r\n   Antoine I have ordered to be purchased into the service; and I\r\n   propose to appoint officers to her. She is a very good ship, and\r\n   has suffered so little that I expect to have her fit for service\r\n   in less than a fortnight. The Spencer and Audacious I detached\r\n   off Cape St. Mary's, and I shall join them with the Pompee and\r\n   Superb the first easterly wind, and resume my station before\r\n   Cadiz, where they cannot have more than four ships ready for\r\n   sea; and, I may venture to pronounce, the Spanish ships will not\r\n   come out, except the French take possession of the batteries and\r\n   compel them. We have almost daily accounts from thence,\r\n   describing the disagreements between the French and Spaniards as\r\n   most serious. They also describe the two French ships as being\r\n   in a very shattered condition, and there being no materials in\r\n   store to repair them.\r\n\r\n   I think my first accounts will reach you by way of Lisbon; but I\r\n   hope Dumaresq, with the subsequent ones, will make his\r\n   appearance very soon after. I am very impatient to hear from\r\n   England. I require small vessels very much, as I have not been\r\n   able to convey the accounts of our success to Lord Keith.\r\n\r\n   When am I to hear from you? and when shall I be assured you have\r\n   not suffered from the relation of these events? The governor and\r\n   others talk to me of honours being conferred; but, unless\r\n   Parliament furnish the means to support them with dignity, I\r\n   might as well be without them. The only ladies I have yet seen\r\n   are, Lady Ann Niel and Mrs. Edwards, whose husbands have\r\n   regiments here; they are very amiable people: besides, Mr.\r\n   Fyers, whose daughter was married the evening of the\r\n   illumination,--an ominous day you will think. Captain Brenton\r\n   will draw you some excellent views of both actions, without\r\n   partiality. I am most highly indebted to him, in getting this\r\n   ship so soon refitted, and, indeed, throughout the whole of our\r\n   important service. A large shot passed through the cabin, which\r\n   filled it with splinters, and demolished the tables and chairs,\r\n   besides the glass. Fortunately, my papers and wardrobe escaped.\r\n   We are now quite refitted; as well, I may say, as we were a\r\n   fortnight ago.\r\n\r\n   I am in want of nothing whatever, but letters from you. Let me\r\n   have favourable accounts of yourself and of our precious\r\n   children, and I shall be satisfied. I hope to send a box of\r\n   Malaga raisins for the young tribe. James will be overjoyed to\r\n   hear of his father's victory.\r\n\r\nThe following is the account of the above action, from the French\r\ncommander-in-chief, dated at Cadiz, 16th July 1801.\r\n\r\n   CITIZEN MINISTER.--General Moreno has returned into harbour.\r\n   General Linois will give you an account of the sailing and\r\n   passage of the squadron. I shall only mention to you the chagrin\r\n   which I have experienced at not seeing the French ship, St.\r\n   Antonio, and the two three-deckers, the Real Carlos and the\r\n   Hermenegildo: a marine, saved with forty-five men from the Real\r\n   Carlos, has informed us that about midnight the squadron having\r\n   been attacked by the English, the Real Carlos and the\r\n   Hermenegildo took each other for enemies. A very smart\r\n   engagement ensued, the two vessels being nearly foul of each\r\n   other. A fire broke out on board the Real Carlos, which soon\r\n   blew up, and set fire to the Hermenegildo, which shared the same\r\n   fate. The St. Antonio, in consequence of her station, was near\r\n   the latter vessel, and this station gave me the greatest\r\n   uneasiness; yet I have been assured that there were only two\r\n   explosions. I have reason to conclude that, to get at a distance\r\n   from the conflagration, Captain Lenny proceeded towards the\r\n   coast of Africa, where the calms and currents carried him away\r\n   from the squadron, which, at the break of day, was six leagues\r\n   west of Cadiz. The day before yesterday the British ships were\r\n   descried from the coast, and a French ship in the Strait; but\r\n   the latter did not appear to be captured. This may give us some\r\n   hope, if the signals are correct. Nothing remains to me but\r\n   uncertainty, with a great deal of fear; I do not know what\r\n   opinion to entertain.\r\n\r\n   After having spoken of our losses, it gives me great pleasure to\r\n   state to you the new glory with which Le Formidable, commanded\r\n   by Captain Troude, has been covered. During the night cannonade,\r\n   in the middle of the Strait, this ship received the fire of her\r\n   friends and enemies; but with intrepid coolness the captain\r\n   would not return the fire, lest he should increase the disorder,\r\n   and, keeping close to the Spanish coast, he retired from the\r\n   combatants. He was followed by a division of the British fleet\r\n   of three ships, and a frigate: and, at break of day, being in\r\n   sight of Cadiz, and five leagues distant from the squadron, he\r\n   was attacked by three ships, with which he was engaged\r\n   half-an-hour, and obliged two of them to retire: the third\r\n   endeavoured to attack Le Formidable on the quarter, while the\r\n   frigate cannonaded her in stern. But, notwithstanding the bad\r\n   state of his masts, Captain Troude approached within musket-shot\r\n   of the British ship, the Pompee, which, having lost her mast,\r\n   after an engagement of an hour and a half, made haste to get\r\n   away, being taken in tow by a frigate. Some time after, both of\r\n   her masts came down, and the vessel had the appearance of having\r\n   yielded; but, as the two other ships and the frigate were at a\r\n   short distance, Captain Troude would not take possession of her:\r\n   he expected to be attacked again. The enemy, disconcerted both\r\n   in their fire and their bravery, suffered him quietly to pursue\r\n   his course.\r\n\r\n   This engagement took place in sight of Cadiz; and the glorious\r\n   result of a combat so unequal, by covering our arms with glory,\r\n   has filled the hearts of the Spaniards with the utmost degree of\r\n   enthusiasm. Le Formidable was scarcely repaired after the battle\r\n   of Algeziras, on the 6th,--top-gallant-mast served as top-masts;\r\n   but, in this damaged state, the brave Troude, instead of flying\r\n   from the enemy, who might have captured him without firing a\r\n   shot, offered them battle, as by this manoeuvre, as prudent as\r\n   bold, he first extricated himself from two ships, which he\r\n   greatly damaged, and at last totally dismasted the Pompee,[40]\r\n   which fought him bravely for an hour and a half.\r\n\r\n     [40] M. Dumanoir le Pelley is in error here. The Pompee was not\r\n     in this action. It has been seen that she was lying disabled at\r\n     Gibraltar.\r\n\r\n   The combined squadron was at that time becalmed, at the distance\r\n   of five or six leagues. I expected to see it, on the breeze\r\n   springing up, come to take possession of this vessel, and give\r\n   chase to capture the four British ships which were in sight; but\r\n   I was far from having any idea of the misfortune which befel the\r\n   two three-deckers, which no doubt occasioned the separation of\r\n   the St. Antonio: and in the evening the squadron came to anchor.\r\n\r\n   Rear-admiral Linois was exceedingly sorry that he was not on\r\n   board the Formidable; but he did not think proper to resist the\r\n   earnest solicitations of General Moreno, who induced him to go\r\n   on board his frigate that they might better concert their\r\n   operations. My respectful salutations,\r\n\r\n   DUMANOIR LE PELLEY.\r\n\r\nReport of Captain Troude, provisional commander of Le Formidable, to\r\nRear-admiral Linois:\r\n\r\n   Cadiz, 15th July 1801.\r\n\r\n   CITIZEN GENERAL,\r\n\r\n   I have the honour of communicating to you an account of the\r\n   operations of Le Formidable, with the provisional command of\r\n   which you entrusted me. Proud of the honourable charge of\r\n   defending your flag, I endeavoured to execute your orders with\r\n   the most scrupulous exactness. I immediately repaired on board\r\n   to assume the chief command, and I put to sea as soon as you\r\n   made the signal.\r\n\r\n   You observed, as well as myself, the movements of the enemy's\r\n   squadron, which had retired to Gibraltar after the memorable\r\n   battle of the 6th at Algeziras. Seeing the enemy set sail at the\r\n   same time as the combined squadrons, and keeping to windward of\r\n   us at the distance of about a league, I endeavoured to follow\r\n   exactly your manoeuvres, and made all the sail possible to\r\n   follow you; but the ship I had the honour to command, being\r\n   absolutely disabled, having only jury-masts and the lower sails,\r\n   I could not make that way which I wished. During the darkness\r\n   of the night a strong breeze broke the small top-gallant-mast\r\n   that served me as a fore-top-mast, and everything contributed to\r\n   prevent me from following the combined squadron.\r\n\r\n   About midnight I sustained the fire of five English ships that\r\n   had come up with me: they fired red-hot bullets. I escaped as\r\n   fast as possible from the brisk cannonade which they maintained,\r\n   hanging up the same lights as I observed them to have. I had\r\n   only three men killed, and two wounded. As I was very near the\r\n   combined squadron, I resolved not to engage, that I might avoid\r\n   those fatal mistakes which too often take place in a night\r\n   engagement. I was afraid lest I might fire into some of our own\r\n   vessels, or that they might fire into mine; from which, fatal\r\n   accidents must have resulted to the combined squadron. At one in\r\n   the morning, not being able to observe or distinguish any more\r\n   signals, I made for Cadiz, keeping close in with the Spanish\r\n   coast, on a course N. or N.E., and by that means got at a\r\n   distance from the squadron, which were steering large in a\r\n   westerly direction.\r\n\r\n   At break of day I found myself attacked by four of the enemy's\r\n   squadron,--three ships and a frigate,--which had pursued the\r\n   same course. Though totally disabled, and the crew fatigued,\r\n   having had no rest for three days, we returned their fire with\r\n   courage: the frigate attacked us first, but a few shots well\r\n   directed from our stern-guns made her abandon her object. The\r\n   ship which followed, approached us, and kept up a brisk fire. We\r\n   manoeuvred to get into a better position; I ran close to her\r\n   until we were yard-arm and yard-arm, and maintained a terrible\r\n   and well-supported fire: after being engaged an hour and a half,\r\n   she was completely dismasted, making water in every part. The\r\n   frigate which had attacked me astern, came immediately to her\r\n   assistance; the other two vessels finding it necessary to sheer\r\n   off after receiving some broadsides, not without damage, joined\r\n   the frigate, and hoisted out all their boats to save the crew of\r\n   the other vessel, and to take her in tow. They resigned to me\r\n   the field of battle, and retired.\r\n\r\n   I expected, however, another combat. We were determined to make\r\n   the most vigorous defence; but, as the enemy retired, and as I\r\n   found myself in such a situation as to be unable to pursue them,\r\n   I resolved to proceed to Cadiz, where I arrived at two in the\r\n   afternoon.\r\n\r\n   I shall not attempt to give you any account of particular\r\n   instances of bravery. The two staffs, the crew, and the troops\r\n   who were passengers, vied with each other,--covering themselves\r\n   with glory; for, besides the noble combat of the 6th, this\r\n   proves that the valour which animated the brave men I have the\r\n   honour to command, was carried to a degree which it is difficult\r\n   to describe. Government will, no doubt, take the earliest\r\n   opportunity of rewarding so much courage, and so great a\r\n   devotion to restore the glory of the French navy. It would be\r\n   just, also, to indemnify them for the losses they have\r\n   sustained; their effects having been cut to pieces and\r\n   absolutely destroyed.\r\n\r\n   I have now, Citizen General, to communicate to you a very fatal\r\n   relation.--In the battle of this night, two of the ships which\r\n   fired upon me, took fire and blew up. I supposed them to be\r\n   English, presuming that the fire had been occasioned by the\r\n   furnaces they had on board for heating their shot; but, on\r\n   entering the harbour of Cadiz, I was assured they were Spanish.\r\n   The darkness had led them into a mistake, which I had justly\r\n   dreaded. They fired on each other, and on my vessel, at the\r\n   moment when I formed the prudent resolution of avoiding a combat\r\n   in which I could not distinguish the enemy. The names of these\r\n   two vessels are the San Carlos and the Hermenegildo.\r\n\r\n   In the combat so severe as that of this morning, and against so\r\n   unequal a force, I am happy in having to regret only twenty men\r\n   killed, or severely wounded.\r\n\r\n   Accept, Citizen General, assurances of my zeal and most\r\n   respectful devotion.\r\n   TROUDE.\r\n\r\nLetter from Rear-admiral Linois to the Minister of the Marine, giving\r\nan account of the action:\r\n\r\n   CITIZEN MINISTER,\r\n\r\n   On the 9th of July a Spanish division, consisting of six sail of\r\n   the line and three frigates, arrived at Algeziras from Cadiz,\r\n   under command of his Excellency Lieutenant-general Moreno, in\r\n   order to raise the blockade of four sail of the line and one\r\n   frigate, which were under my orders, and to favour their escape\r\n   to Cadiz. That officer accordingly gave me every assistance in\r\n   his power in order to put my ships in a condition to put to sea,\r\n   and to tow them out, in order to enable them to set sail. Our\r\n   labour was continued day and night. General Moreno made his\r\n   squadron anchor in a line N.E. and S.W. On the 12th, there was a\r\n   tolerable fresh east wind, and it was determined to set sail at\r\n   one o'clock in the afternoon, on account of the tide. The signal\r\n   being given at that hour, the fleet set sail, the Spanish\r\n   squadron being to windward of ours. The frigate L'Indienne towed\r\n   the Hannibal, which we were sorry to perceive made very little\r\n   way.\r\n\r\n   The calm which we experienced under Gibraltar necessarily\r\n   deranged the regularity of our order; while the enemy, having a\r\n   brisk gale at east, sailed from Gibraltar with five sail of the\r\n   line, a frigate, a brig, and a Portuguese frigate, and formed\r\n   the order of battle. As soon as the English Admiral had passed\r\n   Europa Point, he made a signal, and immediately we saw to\r\n   windward six sail, of which two had three masts. I was then with\r\n   M. de Moreno on board the Sabina frigate. At sunset, the two\r\n   last ships of our line doubled the Cape Carnero. Three only\r\n   remained, with the Hannibal, which was under jury-masts, and\r\n   which consequently could not carry much sail.\r\n\r\n   Night was coming on, and it was necessary to return to our\r\n   anchorage, which afforded the enemy an opportunity of attacking\r\n   us before we took a position. At all events every delay was\r\n   dangerous, for the reinforcements which the enemy expected might\r\n   arrive every moment. The breeze from the east becoming stronger,\r\n   we were assured of the wind during the night. We determined to\r\n   send the Hannibal back to Algeziras, and to pass the Strait with\r\n   the combined squadron. We then manoeuvred so as to facilitate\r\n   the rallying of two of our vessels, which had fallen into the\r\n   rear in consequence of the calm. The three French vessels, which\r\n   sailed better than could have been expected, were in the van;\r\n   and in that order it was proposed to pass the Strait.\r\n\r\n   At eight, the enemy showed a disposition to attack us. At nine\r\n   we heard the reports of three cannon, and at the same time we\r\n   saw fires at a considerable distance behind us. We presumed it\r\n   might be some of the enemy's vessels making signals of their\r\n   arrival. We congratulated ourselves upon seeing our squadrons so\r\n   well collected together, and sailing so well, which made us\r\n   confident that the plan of the enemy would not succeed.\r\n\r\n   At half-past eleven the wind was considerably increased. The\r\n   night was very dark, and we heard a smart cannonade in the\r\n   E.N.E.; and, soon after, we saw a conflagration, which made us\r\n   apprehend that some of our vessels, in firing their stern guns,\r\n   had taken fire, in consequence of the force of the wind. We\r\n   thought also that they might be fire-ships of the enemy. We put\r\n   about for a moment; but the vessel on fire approaching us, we\r\n   continued our way, having constantly a light at our\r\n   main-top-mast head, as a signal for rallying.\r\n\r\n   It could no longer be doubted that the enemy had passed the\r\n   Strait, and had got into our wake. The cannonade became pretty\r\n   general, but the wind was too strong to continue the action. We\r\n   received several shots on board the frigate, which killed one\r\n   man and wounded five. Several balls passed through our sails. We\r\n   took down the signal we had at our mast-head, for fear the enemy\r\n   would fall upon us. It was afterwards hoisted, in order to\r\n   collect our ships. We made sail, directing our course to the\r\n   W.N.W., not choosing to go more before the wind, lest the wind,\r\n   which was very strong, would carry away our masts. We passed the\r\n   night in the greatest disquietude, not knowing whether the\r\n   vessels which were in sight were not enemies. At length the day\r\n   dissipated part of our fears, and we found ourselves in the\r\n   midst of our fleet, with the exception of the two ships of three\r\n   decks, viz. the Hermenegildo and Real Carlos, and the Formidable\r\n   and the St. Antoine. The wind having fallen calm, it became\r\n   impossible to go in search of the vessels which had separated.\r\n   We were then six leagues west of Cadiz.\r\n\r\n   At half-past four the Dessaix made a signal that she had sprung\r\n   a leak, and that the water gained upon her thirty inches an\r\n   hour. She demanded assistance, which was granted. At five\r\n   o'clock we heard an action in the east, and perceived a smoke.\r\n   The wind being then from the S.E., we made the signal for the\r\n   line of battle to be formed as quickly as possible, without\r\n   regard to places, in order to assist the vessel that was\r\n   engaged. At half-past six the action ceased, and a most perfect\r\n   calm succeeded. At eleven, the wind rising again, we perceived\r\n   four vessels at a considerable distance from one another. We\r\n   flattered ourselves at first that they were our ships, but we\r\n   soon found by their manoeuvres that they were enemies. We also\r\n   distinguished the Formidable close under the land, making the\r\n   best of her way to Cadiz. We stood for the port, from which a\r\n   felucca brought me a letter from the captain of the Formidable,\r\n   which had been anchored in the Road of Cadiz, stating that in\r\n   the morning he had engaged two ships of the line and a frigate,\r\n   and that one of the ships of the line had been completely\r\n   dismasted, and had been towed away by a frigate. We then\r\n   anchored in Cadiz.\r\n\r\n   I must acknowledge the consummate experience and talents of\r\n   General Moreno, as well as the zeal and care which he displayed\r\n   for the success of his mission. If separations have taken place,\r\n   they must be attributed to the darkness of the night, and the\r\n   necessity which there was of getting away from the vessels that\r\n   were on fire. That officer, on hearing at Cadiz of the\r\n   destruction of two ships of his squadron, Hermenegildo and\r\n   Real-Carlos, was justly struck with grief on the occasion. He\r\n   had, by his wise instructions, provided against almost every\r\n   possible case. I have since been informed that the two Spanish\r\n   vessels which were destroyed, cannonaded and run foul of one\r\n   another, each supposing the other to be an enemy. We are\r\n   uncertain about the fate of the St. Antoine. The violence of the\r\n   wind made it extremely dangerous to fire to windward.\r\n\r\n   Rear-admiral LINOIS.\r\n\r\n   Dated in Cadiz Harbour, 15th July 1801,\r\n   on board the Formidable.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Moreno's orders to his fleet on the 11th July 1801:\r\n\r\n   Orders of sailing to be observed by the ships in my charge on\r\n   their passage through the Straits of Gibraltar.\r\n\r\n   The three ships under the command of Rear-admiral Linois will\r\n   form the vanguard, with the line abreast; the six ships under my\r\n   charge will form astern of these, likewise formed in a line\r\n   abreast, endeavouring, as much as possible, to keep opposite to\r\n   the intervals of the French ships, so as not to impede their\r\n   fire, according to the following disposition:\r\n\r\n                          Hannibal.\r\n\r\n        Indomptable.

Antonio. nando.\r\n\r\n   In case the enemy should attempt to follow and attack the\r\n   combined squadron in the rear, besides the continual fire which\r\n   we ought to make from the stern chasers, chiefly with a view to\r\n   destroy the enemy's rigging, the squadron will form the line\r\n   ahead, either with their heads to the Spanish coast, or to that\r\n   of Africa, as will be determined by signal from the Admiral;\r\n   and, in order that this might be more simple, in that case, he\r\n   will only show the signal for the course, at the entire lowering\r\n   of which the movements must be made. As their situation, from\r\n   their local position, cannot be of long duration, consequently\r\n   either by hailing (if near enough) or by signal to preserve the\r\n   course, the squadron will proceed again to form the line abreast\r\n   as formerly. It is of the utmost importance that the fire from\r\n   none of the ships should interfere, or be embarrassed with that\r\n   of others in this squadron, nor leave the three French ships in\r\n   the rear.\r\n\r\n   As soon as the French ships get under sail, all those in my\r\n   charge will do the same, following the track of each other,\r\n   always observing to keep at a short distance from the French,\r\n   till we weather the Point of Carnero, in order that if the enemy\r\n   should get under sail, and find themselves in a situation to\r\n   offer battle to our squadron before it is formed in the Straits\r\n   with the line abreast as above directed, we may engage them with\r\n   advantage; consequently, the least inattention or delay may\r\n   produce the most unfortunate consequences.\r\n\r\n   I think the captains of the ships I have the honour to command\r\n   are fully persuaded of this truth, and therefore I depend upon\r\n   its efficacy; and I flatter myself that they are convinced\r\n   everything will be performed on my part which can be inspired by\r\n   my wish to add to the glory of his Majesty's arms, that of our\r\n   corps in particular, and the nation in general.\r\n\r\n     Line of battle in natural order.\r\n\r\n     _2nd Squadron._  _1st Squadron._  _3rd Squadron._\r\n      St. Ferdinand,   Formidable,      Argonauta,\r\n      St. Antonio,     R.

St. Augustin.\r\n\r\n           Fr. frigate Sabina,     Vautour.\r\n\r\n   A red pendant, under any other signal, signifies it is directed\r\n   to the French ships only.\r\n\r\n   To those conversant in naval affairs, it must appear manifest\r\n   that the disposition made by Admirals Moreno and Linois was one\r\n   of the worst that could be devised. It was scarcely possible\r\n   that nine ships, which had never sailed in company with each\r\n   other, could maintain, for any length of time, a line abreast\r\n   before the wind so exactly as to be able to form in a line ahead\r\n   when required, especially in a dark night with a strong breeze;\r\n   and it must be evident that any ship which advanced at all ahead\r\n   of the others could never get into the line of battle when the\r\n   signal was made to form it on either tack. Moreno seems to have\r\n   been fully aware of the probability of the ships firing into\r\n   each other, yet he made arrangements of all others the least\r\n   likely to prevent it. Had he formed into two lines ahead, with\r\n   the disabled ships in advance, he would have obviated the risk\r\n   of firing into each other, while the one division, by shortening\r\n   sail, might have given timely assistance to the other which had\r\n   been attacked.\r\n\r\n   Nothing can equal the scene of horror which the sudden\r\n   conflagration produced in these two ships. The collision in\r\n   which the fore-top-mast of the Hermenegildo fell on board of the\r\n   Real Carlos, added to the general dismay; and the agonising\r\n   screams of the unhappy crews, deserted by their countrymen and\r\n   allies in that dreadful hour, could not fail to pierce the\r\n   hearts of the brave conquerors; but to render them any\r\n   assistance while the hostile flag was flying was impossible. The\r\n   duty of the Admiral was to \"sink, burn, and destroy.\" Seven sail\r\n   of the enemy's line were still flying from half their force, and\r\n   he was obliged to leave the burning ships to their fate, and\r\n   pursue his enemy until his destruction was complete.\r\n\r\n   The capture of the Hannibal, in which the Spaniards had so\r\n   distinguished a share, induced a number of the young men of\r\n   family to embark in the two Spanish three-deckers, in order to\r\n   convey their trophy to Cadiz, never supposing that the\r\n   half-demolished British squadron would dare to approach so\r\n   formidable and so superior a force. This fatal event, while it\r\n   plunged into distress the whole city of Cadiz, could not fail to\r\n   create a sensation strongly unfavourable to their new republican\r\n   allies as the originators of their misery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF THE FIRST VOLUME.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON:\r\n\r\nPRINTED BY SAMUEL BENTLEY,\r\nDorset Street, Fleet Street.\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's note:\r\n\r\n   J.M.
