The careers of many of its heroes have been narrated\r\nfully, and oft in fulsome terms. All Americans unite in these tributes\r\nof praise where justly due.\r\n\r\nJOHN BARRY has, aptly and justly, been called \"THE FATHER OF THE\r\nAMERICAN NAVY.\" His early, constant and worthy services in defence of\r\nour country; his training many of those who became the foremost and most\r\ndistinguished sons of the sea in our early naval annals makes the title\r\none fitly bestowed.\r\n\r\nThe Congress of his country having directed the erection in the Capital\r\nCity of the Nation of a monument commemorative of the man and his deeds,\r\nthis is a fitting time to present a brief record of his career and of\r\nhis deeds during the Revolutionary War, which won the Independence of\r\nour Country, and also in the War with France, which maintained the\r\nintegrity of the new Nation and the protection of its commerce. In both\r\nwars he bore a heroic part. At all times his services were useful and\r\nbrilliant.\r\n\r\n\"Captain John Barry may justly be considered the Father of our Navy,\"\r\nwrote Mr. Dennie in _The Portfolio_, July 1813, in giving the first\r\nbiographical sketch of this distinguished naval officer. \"The utility of\r\nwhose services and the splendor of whose exploits entitle him to the\r\nforemost rank among our naval heroes.\"\r\n\r\nAllen's _Biographical Dictionary_, published in 1809, declared he \"was a\r\npatriot of integrity and unquestioned bravery.\"\r\n\r\nFrost's _Naval Biography_ states: \"Few commanders were employed in a\r\ngreater variety of services or met the enemy under greater\r\ndisadvantages,\" and yet he did not fail to acquit himself of his duty in\r\na manner becoming a skillful seaman and a brave warrior.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BARONY OF FORTH]\r\n\r\n\"His public services were not limited to any customary rule of\r\nprofessional duty, but without regard to labor, danger or excuses, his\r\ndevotion to his Country kept him constantly engaged in acts of public\r\nutility. The regard and admiration of General Washington, which he\r\npossessed in an eminent degree, were among the most eminent fruits of\r\nhis patriotic career.\"\r\n\r\nJudson's _Sages and Heroes of the Revolution_ says: \"Barry was noble in\r\nspirit, humane in discipline, discreet and fearless in battle, urbane\r\nin his manners, a splendid officer, a good citizen, a devoted Christian\r\nand a true Patriot.\"\r\n\r\nMany other quotations might be cited to show the high esteem in which\r\nCommodore John Barry was held as well also the importance of his\r\nservices to our Country.\r\n\r\nA brief narration of his career will set forth the character and worth\r\nof these services as well as afford proof of the valor and fidelity of\r\nthis most successful naval officer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BALLYSAMPSON]\r\n\r\nJohn Barry was born in 1745 in the townland of Ballysampson. He lived\r\nhis boyhood in the townland of Roostoonstown, both in the parish of\r\nTacumshin, Barony of Forth, Province of Leinster in Ireland. The parish\r\ncovers three thousand acres. It is situated between two townland-locked\r\ngulfs with very narrow openings--Lake Tacumshin and Lady's Island Lake.\r\nPossibly these lakes gave young Barry the inspiration for the sea, and\r\nupon both he in youth, we may be sure, oft pulled the oar.\r\n\r\nWhen and under what circumstances young Barry left his birthplace and\r\ndeparted from Ireland are not known. The best traditionary evidence\r\njustifies us in believing that leaving Ireland, while yet young, he went\r\nto Spanishtown in the Island of Jamaica and from there, when about\r\nfifteen years of age, came to Philadelphia, where he found employment in\r\nthe commercial fleets of Samuel Meredith and of Willing & Morris,\r\nleaders in the mercantile life of the city.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TACUMSHIN LOUGH]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LADY'S ISLAND LOUGH]\r\n\r\nBeing but a boy, records do not attest his presence or position. But\r\nhowever lowly, we are sure that merit hovered over every action and\r\nproved the worth of the young navigator of the seas so fully that on\r\nattaining his twenty-first year he was at once entrusted with the sole\r\ncommand of a vessel--the schooner \"Barbadoes,\" sixty tons, which cleared\r\nfrom Philadelphia on October 2, 1766.\r\n\r\nThe schooner he commanded was registered at the Custom House on\r\nSeptember 29, 1766. It was built at Liverpool, in the Province of Nova\r\nScotia and was owned by Edward Denny, of Philadelphia. John Barry was\r\nregistered as its Captain.\r\n\r\nIn this schooner, small in measurement and in tonnage by the standard of\r\nour times and yet not surpassed in either by many vessels in the\r\ncolonial marine trade, John Barry, now a man in years and capabilities,\r\ncontinued until early in 1771 to make voyages to and from Bridgetown,\r\nthe principal port of Barbadoes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRIDGETOWN]\r\n\r\nIn May, 1771, he became Captain of the brig \"Patty and Polly,\" sailing\r\nfrom St. Croix to Philadelphia. In August of that year we find him\r\nCaptain of the schooner \"Industry,\" of forty-five tons, plying to and\r\nfrom Virginia, making trips to New York, voyages to Nevis and to and\r\nfrom Halifax, Nova Scotia until, on October 9, 1772, he became Commander\r\nof the \"Peggy\" sailing to and from St. Eustatia and Montserrat until, on\r\nDecember 19, 1774, a register for the ship the \"Black Prince\" was issued\r\nto John Barry as Master. It was owned by John Nixon, whose grandfather,\r\nRichard, a Catholic, of Barry's own county, Wexford, arrived in\r\nPhiladelphia in 1686. John Nixon read the Declaration of Independence on\r\nJuly 8, 1776. On December 21st Barry sailed to Bristol, where he\r\narrived at the end of January, 1775. Later he proceeded to London, where\r\nhe arrived June 7th, from whence he returned to Philadelphia, where he\r\narrived October 13th, the very day Congress had resolved to fit out two\r\narmed cruisers, one of fourteen guns and one of ten guns, the first act\r\nfounding a Continental naval force for the United Colonies.\r\n\r\nThe Marine Committee, under the authority of this Resolve of the\r\nContinental Congress, purchased two vessels and named one the\r\n\"Lexington,\" the other the \"Reprisal.\"\r\n\r\nTo the \"Lexington\" John Barry was commissioned Captain on December 7,\r\n1775. Captain Wickes was the same day named Commander of the \"Reprisal.\"\r\n\r\nBarry's vessel the \"Black Prince,\" the finest vessel engaged in the\r\nColonial commerce, was purchased by the Marine Committee, renamed the\r\n\"Alfred,\" after Alfred the Great, the founder of the English Navy. To\r\nthe \"Alfred\" John Paul Jones was appointed Lieutenant under Captain\r\nSalstonstall, on the same day Barry and Wickes were appointed Captains.\r\n\r\nThe \"Lexington\" and the \"Reprisal\" were separate and independent\r\ncommands under direct orders of the Marine Committee and not subject to,\r\nnor were they part of, the fleet under Commodore Hopkins. Captain John\r\nBarry was thus the first Commander appointed under the direct authority\r\nof the Continental Congress. He was appointed to the first Continental\r\narmed cruiser--the \"Lexington\"--named after the first battle place of\r\nthe Revolution. It was the first vessel fitted out under Continental\r\nauthority by the Marine Committee and \"in the nature of things was more\r\nreadily equipped\" than the \"Alfred,\" says Cooper's _History of the\r\nNavy_. This was especially so as Willing & Morris, Captain Barry's late\r\nemployers, alone had a stock of \"round shot for four pounders, under\r\ntheir store in Penn Street and in their yard.\" These were readily\r\navailable to Captain Barry of the \"Lexington.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Barry's cruiser was ready for sea the severity of the weather in\r\nblocking the Delaware with ice debarred its passage to the Bay and out\r\ninto the Ocean. In the meanwhile Barry was busily employed on shore duty\r\nand in assisting in preparing the fleet of Commodore Hopkins for its\r\ndeparture on February 17, 1776, on its expedition to the Southward. This\r\nfleet was intended for the protection of American vessels off the coast\r\nof Virginia, but it proceeded to the Bahama Islands. On St. Patrick's\r\nDay, 1776, Hopkins sailed from New Providence bringing the Governor and\r\nothers as hostages as well as securing military stores and ammunition.\r\nWashington on the same day was entering the City of Boston on its forced\r\nevacuation by the British.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Captain John Barry was busy in constant service on the\r\nDelaware River and on shore, promoting the progress of naval affairs\r\nconducive to the formation of a navy.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, until March 23d that Congress ordered Letters of\r\nMarque to be issued and authorized public and private cruisers to\r\ncapture British vessels or to seize or destroy supplies for the British\r\nnaval forces.\r\n\r\nCaptain Barry, in the \"Lexington,\" at once proceeded down the Delaware.\r\nOn March 29, 1776, was off Cape May, New Jersey. On Sunday, the 31st,\r\nthe \"Lexington\" went out to sea--his first entry upon the watery domain\r\nbearing the flag of defiance--the Union or Continental flag hoisted at\r\nCambridge on January 1, 1776, by General Washington, which he had\r\nadopted so that \"our vessels may know one another,\" and so \"distinguish\r\nour friends from our foes,\" as he had written Captain Barry's friend and\r\nfellow-Catholic of Philadelphia, Colonel Stephen Moylan, the Muster\r\nMaster General of his army.\r\n\r\nWhen Captain Barry proceeded to sea, the \"Roebuck,\" British man-of-war,\r\n\"one of His Majesty's pirates\" and her tender, the \"Edward,\" \"put to\r\nsea\" also after the \"Lexington,\" but Barry was too swift and got so far\r\naway that the \"Roebuck\" returned the same evening to the Bay.\r\n\r\nBarry's historical and patriotic career had begun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ADMIRALTY SEAL AND SIGNATURE OF THE SECRETARY OF THE\r\nBOARD]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n   CAPTURES THE \"EDWARD\"--HIS PRISONER RICHARD DALE--IMPORTANCE OF THE\r\n   PRIZE--BARRY UNKNOWN TO OR IGNORED BY CAPTAIN HOBSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"Lexington\" cruised off the coast of Virginia a week without meeting\r\nwith the enemy. Barry had gone to sea on Sunday. The Sunday following,\r\nApril 7, 1776, while off the \"Capes of Virginia\" he \"fell in with the\r\nsloop 'Edward' belonging to the 'Liverpool' frigate\" and \"shattered her\r\nin a terrible manner,\" as he reported to the Marine Committee, after an\r\nengagement of \"near two glasses.\" The \"Lexington\" lost two men killed\r\nand two wounded. The \"Edward\" had \"several of her crew killed and\r\nwounded.\" She carried \"eight guns and a number of swivels\" and was\r\ncommanded by Lieutenant Richard Boger of the \"Liverpool.\" Barry brought\r\nthe \"shattered\" captive to Philadelphia with the crew of twenty-five\r\nprisoners taken.\r\n\r\nAmong the number was Richard Dale, of Virginia, who had been Lieutenant\r\nof a light cruiser in the service of Virginia, which had been captured\r\nby the \"Edward.\" Dale was \"induced to adopt the Royal cause\" and so took\r\nservice on the \"Edward\" and so was taken prisoner.\r\n\r\nCaptain Barry induced young Dale to return to American allegiance and\r\naccept service under him on the \"Lexington\" as Midshipman. Dale in\r\nOctober, when the \"Lexington\" was assigned to Captain Johnston, became\r\nMaster's Mate. He continued in the service of the United Colonies and\r\nrose to be a Commodore in the Navy under the present Constitution. He\r\never retained the friendship of Captain Barry, who, by his will,\r\nbequeathed to his \"good friend, Captain Richard Dale, his gold-hilted\r\nsword as a token of his esteem.\"\r\n\r\nThis sword had been presented to John Paul Jones by King Louis XVI after\r\nthe memorable battle between the \"Bonne Homme Richard\" commanded by\r\nJones and the \"Serapis,\" as the expedition commanded by Jones was under\r\nFrench auspices and direction. The sword \"was sent by Jones' heirs to\r\nRobert Morris,\" the financier of the Revolution, \"who presented it to\r\nCommodore John Barry, the senior officer of the present American Navy,\r\nwho will never disgrace it,\" Morris wrote, March 18, 1795, to Thomas\r\nPinckney, the American Minister to Great Britain. Barry by his will\r\nbequeathed it to \"my good friend Captain Richard Dale,\" with whose\r\ndescendants it yet remains. It is claimed by the Morris family that the\r\ngift to Barry was \"in trust to descend to the senior officer of the\r\nNavy.\" There is no proof of the trust nor is there any that Jones' heirs\r\ngave the sword of great money value to Morris. Morris had it. He gave it\r\nto Barry who bequeathed it to Dale who, two months before Barry made his\r\nwill, had resigned from the Navy. There could have been no \"trust\" for\r\nBarry to \"disregard.\" But it is singular that it is now possessed by\r\nthose whose ancestor had, by Barry, been induced to return to American\r\nallegiance after having entered the service of the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe \"Edward,\" taken by Barry, was the first armed vessel taken under the\r\nauthority of the Continental Marine Committee and brought to\r\nPhiladelphia, the seat of Congress, and delivered to its Marine\r\nCommittee. Previous captures off the New England coast by Manly and\r\nothers, had been those of unarmed supply vessels to Quebec or Boston\r\nunder authority of General Washington. The capture was most important.\r\nWhen the project had, in August, 1775, been presented to Congress by the\r\ndelegates from Rhode Island, by direction of its Assembly, to fit out\r\narmed cruisers, many of the patriots thought it of doubtful wisdom to do\r\nso against the powerful British Navy. Samuel Chase, of Maryland,\r\ndeclared \"it is the maddest idea in the world.\"\r\n\r\nSo Barry's capture was a demonstration of the ability of the Colonies to\r\ncontest the sea with Great Britain and to do it so effectively that \"we\r\ncaptured from the British over eight hundred vessels and more than\r\ntwelve thousand seamen, and of these more than one hundred were war\r\nvessels of the Royal Navy, carrying more than two thousand, five hundred\r\nguns, while the American losses were scarcely more than one-sixth those\r\nof the British,\" as Captain Richmond Pearson Hobson declared in an\r\naddress on the Navy on Flag Day, 1901, at the Buffalo Pan-American\r\nExposition. Yet he, in looking \"over the range of our Naval history, saw\r\na long line of majestic figures whose very names are an inspiration,\"\r\ndid not, in giving the names of twenty-one of these \"majestic figures,\"\r\nname Captain John Barry, the very \"Father of the Navy.\" He was not\r\nmentioned as among those which \"History with her bright and luminous\r\npencil inscribed upon the glorious scroll.\" Captain Hobson, the heroic,\r\nis now a member of Congress from Alabama and ought to make reparation\r\nfor his ignorance or conscious ignoring of the foremost naval commander\r\nof the very Navy he proved himself to be a worthy representative of. He\r\nmay become unknown or be ignored if known.\r\n\r\nCaptain Barry had command of the first Continental cruiser, the\r\n\"Lexington,\" and the last frigate, the \"Alliance\"--the largest and\r\nfinest vessel in the Revolutionary Navy--had made the first capture\r\nunder Continental authority and fought the last battle of the\r\nRevolution, and commanded the whole of the Navy at the close of the\r\nwar--had been the earliest, the constant and the latest fighter and the\r\nfirst Captain and ranking officer of the present Navy on its\r\nestablishment in 1794. Yet he was entirely unknown to Captain Hobson. Or\r\nwas he purposely ignored?\r\n\r\nThe capture of the \"Edward\" was considered of considerable import in\r\npatriot circles: \"We begin to make some little figure here in the navy\r\nway,\" wrote John Adams, the day after the arrival of Barry and his\r\nprize. The Marine Committee also wrote to Commodore Hopkins, who had\r\narrived at New London, Connecticut, the same day Barry had arrived at\r\nPhiladelphia with his prize, informing him of the capture and saying the\r\nloss to the British of the twenty-five men was one \"they cannot easily\r\nprovide against--the want of men.\"\r\n\r\nThe demonstration of satisfaction at Philadelphia because of Barry's\r\nsuccess gave heart to the patriots in an endeavor to have an increase in\r\nthe naval force. By the alertness of armed cruisers, protection would be\r\ngiven to the supplies coming to the Americans and at the same time\r\ncaptures could be made of supplies going to the British.\r\n\r\nOn May 1, 1776, the \"Edward,\" condemned by the Court of Admiralty as a\r\nprize to the \"Lexington'\" was, with all her ammunition, furniture,\r\ntackle and apparel, sold at public auction and the proceeds divided\r\nbetween the Government and Captain Barry and his crew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n   BARRY APPOINTED TO COMMAND DEFENSIVE OPERATIONS IN DELAWARE BAY AND\r\n   RIVER--CAPTURES BRITISH SUPPLIES AND PROTECTS AMERICAN--SAVES THE\r\n   CARGO OF THE \"NANCY\" AND EXPLODES HER WHEN THE BRITISH BOARD\r\n   HER--CAPTURES THE \"LADY SUSAN\" AND THE \"BETSY\"--APPOINTED TO THE\r\n   \"EFFINGHAM.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"Lexington\" was not in a condition to then proceed on another\r\nexpedition, as she needed fitting up. Yet Captain Barry was not\r\npermitted to be idle. On May 8th, Robert Morris, for the Marine\r\nCommittee of Congress, directed him to go down the Delaware River in the\r\nsloop \"Hornet,\" commanded by Captain Hallock, and to take the officers\r\nand men of the \"Lexington\" to supply the Provincial armed ship,\r\ncommanded by Captain Read, the Floating Battery and the \"Reprisal,\"\r\nunder Captain Wickes, with men sufficient to have these vessels \"fit for\r\nimmediate action,\" and to give the \"utmost exertions\" of himself,\r\nofficers and men in defending the pass at Fort Island so as to prevent\r\nthe British coming to Philadelphia; and also to take, sink or destroy\r\nsuch as attempted to do so as well as pursue those he thought it\r\nadvisable to follow. This made Captain Barry the Commodore or ranking\r\nofficer in the naval operations in Delaware Bay. The next day Captain\r\nBarry reported to Mr. Morris, urging the fitting out of the \"Lexington\"\r\nso \"she might be of service. The more there is the better,\" said the\r\nCaptain, though adding, \"We shall keep them in play.\"\r\n\r\nSo the \"Lexington\" was fitted out and sent down the Bay to Barry where\r\nthe \"Roebuck\" and \"Liverpool,\" British frigates, were \"in and about.\"\r\nBarry joined the rest of the fleet at Cape May. The \"Liverpool\" \"was\r\nscared away\" when the Americans went \"in quest of the pirates.\"\r\n\r\nAt this time the thirteen vessels ordered in December to be built for\r\nthe Marine Committee were being completed at Philadelphia, Boston and\r\nBaltimore. Captain Barry was appointed to the command of one being built\r\nat Philadelphia--the \"Effingham\" being assigned him in October.\r\n\r\nAll the while, however, Barry was in command of the \"Lexington\" in the\r\nDelaware Bay and off the Capes, giving protection to the Continental\r\nsupply vessels coming to Philadelphia, which had been sent out for\r\nnecessaries. One arrived at Philadelphia with 7,400 pounds of powder as\r\nwell as a number of firearms. Barry also sent up to Philadelphia the war\r\nstores he captured. On June 12, 1776, the Secret Committee of Congress\r\ndirected that Colonel Megraw's Battalion be given the 191 firearms \"sent\r\nup by Captain Barry.\" She narrowly escaped capture by the \"Liverpool,\"\r\nbut two of the Continental vessels protected her and a French schooner.\r\nOther French vessels from the West Indies, bringing molasses, coffee,\r\nlinen and other supplies were also saved from capture by Captain Barry\r\nand the other Continental and Provincial commanders under his authority.\r\nOn June 10th the \"Kingfisher,\" British man-of-war, captured a brigantine\r\nfrom Wilmington, but \"before the pirate boarded her our brave Captain\r\nBarry had been on board of her and taken out some powder and arms,\" was\r\nthe report Henry Fisher, of Lewistown, sent the Committee of Safety by\r\nwhale-boat to New Castle and thence by land because the Tories of the\r\nCounty had cut off all horse express communication.\r\n\r\nThe tenders of the \"Roebuck,\" the \"Liverpool\" and the \"Kingfisher\"\r\nattempted to seize the cattle and stock which the Tories had stored for\r\nthe British at Indian River, \"but were prevented by Barry's brig,\" as\r\nthey called her, thus indicating that the alertness and success of the\r\n\"brave Captain Barry\" had become conspicuously known to the Tories of\r\nlower Delaware, a nest of Loyalists.\r\n\r\nThe brig \"Nancy\" bringing supplies from St. Croix and St. Thomas for\r\nCongress account and having 386 barrels of gunpowder, 50 firelocks, 101\r\nhogsheads of rum, 62 of sugar and bales of dry goods, on June 29, 1776,\r\nwhile making for Cape May, was pursued by six British men-of-war but,\r\ngetting assistance from Captain Barry's \"Lexington,\" she was run ashore\r\nand 268 barrels of the powder and most of the other stores saved. Powder\r\nwas, by Barry's order, placed in the cabin and in the mainsail, in the\r\nfolds of which fire was put. The British boarded the brig. An explosion\r\nsoon took place and \"blew the pirates into the air.\" It \"was supposed\r\nforty or fifty were destroyed by the explosion.\"\r\n\r\nOn July 2, 1776, the day the Resolution declared the Colonies free and\r\nindependent, John Hancock, President of the Congress so declaring,\r\nnotified Captain Barry that as \"the frigate you are to command is not\r\nyet launched, her guns and anchors not yet ready,\" it was but \"a piece\r\nof justice due to your merit to allow you to make a cruise in the\r\n'Lexington' for one or two months, in hopes that fortune may favor your\r\nindustry and reward it with some good prizes.\" On this cruise Barry met\r\nthat \"fortune\" which his industry merited. He captured several prizes of\r\nwhich record have been discovered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIGNATURES TO BARRY'S ORDERS]\r\n\r\nOn August 2d the \"Lady Susan,\" \"an armed vessel, was taken by Captain\r\nBarry at sea,\" reported Caesar Rodney to his brother at Dover the next\r\nday. This was \"a privateer of eight four-pound carriage guns commanded\r\nby another of those famous Goodriches of Virginia.\" She was loaded with\r\nnaval stores from Bermuda. After an \"obstinate engagement\" of an hour\r\nand a half \"she struck.\" Nearly all of her crew of twenty-five after\r\ntheir capture took service under Barry.\r\n\r\nThe \"Betsy,\" a sloop of fifty tons, commanded by Samuel Kerr, was also\r\nat this time captured by the \"Lexington\" under Barry. Both prizes were\r\ncondemned to Captain Barry on September 26th by the Court of Admiralty,\r\nbut an appeal in the case of the \"Betsy\" was taken to Congress.\r\n\r\nThe newly built \"Effingham\" being ready, Captain Barry surrendered, on\r\nOctober 18, 1776, the \"Lexington\" to Captain Henry Johnston and took\r\ncommand of the \"Effingham,\" named in honor of Lord Effingham, who had\r\nresigned his commission in the British Army rather than take arms\r\nagainst the Colonies, because of his \"strict adherence to those\r\nprinciples of the Revolution of 1688,\" which he declared the Colonies\r\nwere contending for and for so doing the merchants of Dublin, on July\r\n17, 1775, approved of his conduct in \"honestly and spiritedly\r\nresigning,\" and for his \"noble efforts in support of American Liberty.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n   BARRY APPOINTED TO THE \"EFFINGHAM\"--THE QUESTION OF RANK--BARRY\r\n   ENGAGES IN THE TRENTON CAMPAIGN--AN AIDE TO WASHINGTON AND TO\r\n   CADWALLADER--COMMANDER OF THE PORT OF PHILADELPHIA--STRIKE OF THE\r\n   NAVY LIEUTENANTS--OPERATIONS OF BARRY ON THE DELAWARE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA reorganization of the Navy of the United Colonies took place on\r\nOctober 10, 1776, when assignments were made of the several armed\r\nvessels then belonging to the \"United States,\" as that was the title\r\nCongress had, on September 9th, ordered to be used in all public\r\ndocuments. The order in which these assignments were made was generally\r\nregarded as fixing the rank of each Captain. So it occasioned agitation\r\nand discussion. It was not, however, officially stated that such was the\r\ncase. Later it was declared not to be so by Committee of Congress.\r\n\r\nCaptain John Barry was assigned to No. 7 on the list. Those preceding\r\nhim were: (1) James Nicholson, to the \"Virginia,\" 28 guns; (2) John\r\nManly, to the \"Hancock,\" 32 guns; (3) Hector McNeil, to the \"Boston,\" 24\r\nguns; (4) Dudley Salstonstall, to the \"Trumbull,\" 28 guns; (5) Nicholas\r\nBiddle, to the \"Randolph,\" 32 guns; (6) Thomas Thompson, to the\r\n\"Raleigh,\" 32 guns; (7) John Barry, to the \"Effingham,\" 28 guns. John\r\nPaul Jones was given No. 18. The Marine Committee in making up the list\r\ncould hardly, in view of the number of guns of the several vessels and\r\nthe selection of Captains who had not as yet served in the Navy, have\r\nintended the position assigned as fixing the official rank of the\r\nseveral officers. James Nicholson, the first named and to a 28-gun ship,\r\nhad not heretofore been noted for any special services justifying his\r\nappointment as the ranking officer of the Navy, though giving him a\r\nvessel inferior in armament to others lower in position. Captain John\r\nManly, No. 2, was \"uneasy and threatened to resign.\" He had in New\r\nEngland waters done early and good services. Captain Thompson's friends\r\ndeclared he ought to have been placed higher. Yet Manly and Thompson\r\nwere given 32-gun ships, while Captain Nicholson, No. 1, was given a 28\r\nand Captain Barry, No. 7, was also given a 28. Captain John Paul Jones,\r\nNo. 18, ever contested the assignment to that position, declaring that\r\n\"rank opens the door to glory.\" As late as 1781 he made contest before\r\nCommittee of Congress. It reported that though there was, \"on October\r\n10, 1776, an arrangement of Captains, the Committee cannot fully\r\nascertain the rule by which that arrangement was made, as the relative\r\nrank was not conformable to the times of appointment or dates of\r\ncommission and seems repugnant to a resolution of December 22, 1775.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Barry appears not to have made any objection to his position on\r\nthe list. He was ready and eager for service and, seemingly, not\r\nconcerned as to rank or position. He had been given a vessel equal to\r\nCaptain Nicholson, No. 1. Those to whom stronger armament had been given\r\nhad not been early or foremost in service or activity. Some of them did\r\nnot, later, justify any outranking, if that were the case. Captain Barry\r\nwas early in the struggle, foremost during its continuance and latest in\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nJones declared that some gentlemen in the first days of the Navy did not\r\njoin the Navy as \"they did not choose to be hanged, as the hazard was\r\nvery great.\" But Captain John Barry did not hesitate. He came quickly\r\nfrom London to engage in the conflict, and from the very first day of\r\nhis return to America was active in service and on duty. Still rank was\r\nnot necessary to \"open the door to glory,\" for No. 7 became the chief\r\nofficer of the Navy and No. 18 achieved imperishable fame and popular\r\nrenown. The pay of the Captains was sixty dollars a month. The uniform\r\nwas: Blue cloth with red lapels, slash cuff, stand-up collar, flat\r\nyellow buttons, blue breeches, red waistcoat with yellow lace.\r\n\r\nInterested in the Navy, Captain Barry was also concerned in affairs on\r\nland. So when on November 25, 1776, a meeting was held at the Indian\r\nQueen Hotel, Philadelphia, to consider accusations against those\r\n\"suspected as Tories and unfriendly to the cause of America,\" Captain\r\nBarry was there. We may be sure he was earnest and active in any\r\nmeasures to restrict the operations of those inimicable to Liberty or\r\nengaged in efforts detrimental to the Patriots' endeavors.\r\n\r\nCaptain Barry, on November 30, 1776, united with Captains Biddle, Read,\r\nAlexander and John Nicholson in a memorial to Congress. It was referred\r\nto the Marine Committee, who were directed to pursue such measures as\r\nthey might think proper. What the memorial related to has not been\r\ndiscovered after long continued endeavor to ascertain. It is not among\r\nthe papers of the Continental Congress nor mentioned in the records of\r\nthe Marine Committee, which have been preserved at the Library of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nAt this time affairs were serious with General Washington. The battle of\r\nLong Island, in August, had been disastrous. Forts Lee and Washington,\r\nthe bulwarks of the Hudson, had been lost and the sad and gloomy, but\r\nmarvelously strategic, retreat across New Jersey was being conducted by\r\nWashington, pursued by Lord Cornwallis.\r\n\r\nWashington \"was at the end of the tether.\" \"In ten days this army will\r\nhave ceased to exist,\" was his almost despairing cry to Congress,\r\ncalling for aid to strengthen his disappearing and dispirited army. Yet\r\non the upper Delaware, amid all the encircling gloom, God's precious\r\nProvidence and love was at no time during the Revolution more strikingly\r\nmanifested. All seemed lost this bleak December, 1776. The hour of\r\ndefeat, dismay and destruction seemed about to strike. The timid, the\r\nfaint-hearted, the treacherous were fast accepting British allegiance.\r\nEven heretofore stalwart hearts wavered in the cause of Liberty. The\r\nnewly proclaimed Independence of hot July, the threat and defiance of\r\nthe Colonies to England's tyranny, was now in the chill December, like\r\nthe earth, about to be sheathed in the coldness of death.\r\n\r\nThe alarm came to Philadelphia. Shops were shut, schools closed and the\r\ninhabitants engaged solely in providing for the defense of the City, now\r\nthe aim of the enemy. But out of all this gloom and alarm came the\r\nvictory at Trenton.\r\n\r\nCaptain John Barry organized a company of volunteers and went to\r\nWashington's assistance. In cooperation with the marines under Captain\r\nWilliam Brown, he lent efficient service in transporting Washington's\r\narmy across the Delaware prior to the Battle of Trenton. Captain Barry\r\nacted as an aide to General Cadwallader, and on one occasion, of which\r\nthere is record, as an aide to Washington in the safe conduct to\r\nPhiladelphia of the baggage of the captured Hessians and also of the\r\nsurgeons and physicians to Princeton.\r\n\r\nAfter the Trenton campaign and its consequent successful results,\r\nCaptain Barry returned to Philadelphia and engaged in naval preparations\r\nfor the defense of the city. He was the Senior Commander of the Navy in\r\nthe Port of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1777, twelve of the lieutenants of the fleet under Barry struck\r\nfor an increase of pay and allowances. They notified Captain Barry they\r\nwould not act on board any vessel until their grievances were redressed.\r\nBarry informed the Marine Committee. It reported the affair to Congress,\r\nsaying that such a combination of officers was of the \"most dangerous\r\ntendency.\" Whereupon the Congress dismissed all of the lieutenants and\r\ndeclared their commissions \"void and of no effect.\" The offenders were\r\ndeclared incapable of holding any commission under the United States and\r\nrecommending the several States not to employ any in offices civil or\r\nmilitary. This brought the lieutenants to \"acknowledge in the most\r\nexplicit manner that the offense for which they were dismissed is highly\r\nreprehensible and could not be justified under any circumstances or any\r\npretence whatever, and that they were exceedingly sorry for the rashness\r\nwhich betrayed them into such behavior.\" Then the strikers were\r\n\"restored to former rank and command.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MISS ELIZABETH ADAMS BARNES\r\n\r\nGreat-Great-Grandniece of Commodore Barry; who christened \"The Barry\"\r\nBoat March 22, 1902]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n   THE BRITISH CAPTURE PHILADELPHIA--ACTIVITY OF BARRY--COMMANDER OF\r\n   NAVY AT PORT OF PHILADELPHIA--BATTLE AT RED BANK--ORDERED BY\r\n   WASHINGTON AND NAVY BOARD TO SINK THE VESSELS ON THE UPPER\r\n   DELAWARE--PROTESTS--DECLARED HE KNEW MORE ABOUT A SHIP THAN\r\n   WASHINGTON AND THE BOARD--CHARGED WITH DISRESPECT--HIS DEFENSE TO\r\n   CONGRESS--HIS BRILLIANT OPERATIONS ON THE DELAWARE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe British, in 1776 having failed to reach Philadelphia by the\r\nnorthward way through New Jersey, planned the 1777 campaigns to end with\r\nthe capture from the southward by the Chesapeake of the capital of \"the\r\nrebels.\" This was in accordance with the plan, as we now know, of\r\nGeneral Charles Lee, second in command to Washington, while he was a\r\nprisoner in New York. He thus proved himself a traitor more despicable\r\neven than Arnold. His infamy did not become known until of late years.\r\nMoving northward from the head of the Chesapeake Bay, the British\r\nencountered Washington at Brandywine and, defeating him, secured an\r\nentrance to Philadelphia when it pleased General Howe to enter, which he\r\ndid on September 26th, amid the welcoming acclaim of the people who\r\nremained. The Patriots had generally left the city.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d the Navy Board ordered all vessels south of Market Street to\r\nmove down the river and all north to go up the Delaware to escape\r\nfalling into the hands of the British. Barry's \"Effingham\" went down the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nBarry, as the Senior Commander of the Navy at the Port of Philadelphia,\r\nhad charge of the \"row gallies, batteries\" and other vessels protecting\r\nand maintaining the _chevaux de frize_ off Billingsport by sinking\r\nobstructions to prevent the passage to the city of any British vessels\r\nand thus effectually stopping the channel.\r\n\r\nThe British erected a battery near the mouth of the Schuylkill upon\r\nwhich Barry's galleys fired at times but seemingly with but little\r\neffect, though \"playing their part most nobly and acting like men and\r\nfreemen convincing the world their liberty was merited,\" to use the\r\nwords of Thomas McKean to General Rodney.\r\n\r\nWhen, on October 22, 1777, Count Donop attacked the Americans in Fort\r\nMercer at Red Bank, the British fleet cooperated with the land forces,\r\nwhile the Continental vessels under Barry and the Pennsylvania fleet\r\nunder Hazlewood drove them back, preventing their passage up the river.\r\nThe British frigate the \"Augusta\" and the \"Merlin\" were driven ashore.\r\nThe \"Merlin\" was set on fire by its crew. The powder on the \"Augusta\"\r\nexploded and that vessel was blown up. Portions of its remains are in\r\nthe water off Red Bank to this day.\r\n\r\nFort Mifflin, held by the Americans, was attacked on November 16, 1777.\r\nUnable to have the assistance of the Continental or the State Navy, the\r\nfort was abandoned. A council of the commanders of the fleet was held,\r\nwhen it was decided that an endeavor should be made at night to take all\r\nthe vessels up the river, as the British fleet held control of the lower\r\nDelaware. To do this it was necessary to pass Philadelphia, then in\r\npossession of the British. This was successfully accomplished by the\r\nState fleet early in the morning of November 16th. They were\r\n\"unperceived,\" says the British account, until the passage had been\r\nsuccessfully made. The enemy were more alert the following night when\r\nthe Continental vessels under Barry endeavored to make the passage.\r\nThree or four succeeded. Others had to be burned to prevent capture. The\r\nsuccess of this elusive passage up the river emboldened, as we shall see\r\nlater, Captain Barry, a few months afterwards, to make another\r\nsuccessful passage down the river, passing, unmolested, the British\r\nvessels off Philadelphia and getting down into the Bay to oppose the\r\nBritish hovering thereabouts.\r\n\r\nBarry's operations on the Delaware, while the British occupied\r\nPhiladelphia, were as brilliant and as audacious in bravery as any\r\nservices performed during his career. Doubtless from his activity, good\r\njudgment and bravery at this period may have proceeded all the successes\r\nof his subsequent career. The Continental authorities were made aware at\r\nonce of the abilities of the gallant man whom they had so early in the\r\nstruggle for Independence placed in command.\r\n\r\nDuring the attack on Fort Mifflin by the British, Lieutenant Ford, of\r\nBarry's \"Effingham,\" and Lieutenant Lyons, of the \"Dickinson,\" deserted.\r\nAfter the British had evacuated Philadelphia these deserters were\r\ncaptured and on September 2, 1778, shot. The execution took place on a\r\nguard-boat off Market Street.\r\n\r\nAfter the Continental and State fleets had arrived in the upper Delaware\r\nnear Bordentown, Washington, in November, 1777, notified the\r\nContinental Navy Board there was danger of a British force being sent to\r\ndestroy the vessels. So he directed they should be sunk. Barry was, by\r\nthe Board, on November 2d, directed to move the \"Effingham\" \"a little\r\nbelow White Hill\" (now Fieldsboro, N.J.) \"where she may lie on a soft\r\nbottom. You are to sink her there without delay by sunset this evening.\"\r\nBut Barry was loath to sink the vessel he had been appointed to command\r\nand fight. Later in the month Francis Hopkinson, of the Navy Board,\r\ndelivered to Captain Barry, as Senior Officer, \"orders, in writing,\" to\r\nsink or burn the ships. Captains Barry and Read had taken every measure\r\nto defend the vessels which Barry declared he believed would be\r\neffectual in repelling any force the enemy would send to destroy them.\r\n\r\nBarry and Read protested to the Board against the sinking, saying that\r\nif Washington knew the security of the ships he would not order the\r\nsinking. Barry offered to go and inform him, but Hopkinson declared\r\nWashington had been informed and his order would be carried out. He told\r\nBarry that the order should be obeyed; that he would take Washington's\r\nopinion in preference to Barry's.\r\n\r\n\"I told him,\" related Barry in his defense, when summoned before\r\nCongress sitting at York, for disrespect to the Navy Board, \"that\r\nnevertheless I knew more about a ship than General Washington and the\r\nNavy Board together. That I was commissioned by Congress to command the\r\n'Effingham' and, therefore, expected to be consulted before she was\r\ndestroyed.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall obey our orders,\" was the quick and somewhat heated reply.\r\nWhereupon Barry left him \"of course in high dudgeon,\" said Barry. \"I\r\nimmediately repaired to my ship, got all clear--and the orders were\r\npunctually obeyed\"--while Hopkinson himself was on board giving orders\r\nwhich did not permit the vessel to keel and so was \"very near\r\nupsetting.\" When Barry reported the condition of the ship to the Navy\r\nBoard, he was told \"it was a misfortune and we must do the best to\r\nremedy it,\" to which Barry replied that nothing would be wanting on his\r\npart.\r\n\r\nTwo attempts to raise the \"Effingham\" failed for want of men and\r\nmaterial, whereupon Mr. Hopkinson said he would raise her himself--\"an\r\ninsult I overlooked, having the getting up of the ship much at heart,\"\r\nBarry told Congress. So he got everything ready and sent for as many of\r\nthe invalid soldiers as could be had, and with the seamen began to\r\nheave. And he too \"worked with as much ardor as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Captain Barry, doth she rise,\" called Hopkinson.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir! How can she rise when you keep the people back,\" replied\r\nBarry. This was an allusion to Hopkinson's order that only invalids,\r\nwell attired, should be sent to assist the seamen.\r\n\r\n\"Puh! You are always grumbling,\" retorted Hopkinson.\r\n\r\n\"What do you say?\" quickly cried Barry.\r\n\r\n\"Go along and mind your own business, you scoundrel,\" roared Hopkinson.\r\n\r\n\"It is a lie,\" said Barry.\r\n\r\n\"What! Do you tell me I lie?\" said Hopkinson.\r\n\r\n\"It was a lie in them that said so,\" was Barry's rejoinder.\r\n\r\nHopkinson replied that he would bring Barry to an account for this.\r\n\r\n\"My answer was,\" Barry told Congress, \"Damn you! I don't value you more\r\nthan my duty requires.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir! You never minded your duty,\" retorted Hopkinson.\r\n\r\n\"I immediately told him he was a liar and that the Continental Congress\r\nknew I had minded my duty, and added that had he minded his duty as well\r\nthe ship would not be in its present condition.\"\r\n\r\nThe Navy Board, on December 11, 1777, complained to Congress of the\r\n\"disrespect and ill treatment which Hopkinson had received from John\r\nBarry, commander of the frigate 'Effingham.'\"\r\n\r\nBarry was summoned to York, Pa., where Congress was in session. On\r\nJanuary 10th he attended and made defense, concluding by saying that he\r\nconsidered himself \"unworthy the commission of Congress if he tamely put\r\nup with treatment other than that due to all Captains of the Navy as\r\ngentlemen.\"\r\n\r\nOn February 27th the Marine Committee reported to Congress that \"Captain\r\nBarry ought, within twenty days, make full acknowledgment to the Navy\r\nBoard of having treated Mr. Hopkinson with indecency and disrespect.\"\r\nNothing further appears on record, so it is presumed Captain Barry\r\ncomplied and the case closed. At this time Barry was, by order of the\r\nsame Committee, actively at work destroying British supplies in the\r\nlower Delaware from Mantua Creek to Port Penn and Bombay Hook.\r\n\r\nCongress was equally divided on a resolution that Captain Barry be not,\r\nin consequence of his conduct towards Hopkinson, \"employed on the\r\nexpedition assigned to his conduct by the Marine Committee with the\r\napprobation of Congress until the further order of Congress.\" Had he not\r\nbeen employed, Washington might not, later, have been cheered by the\r\nresults which Captain Barry achieved in \"the expedition\" against the\r\nBritish supply vessels coming up the Delaware.\r\n\r\nWashington, amid the desolation of Valley Forge, had his heart torn by\r\nthe suffering of his Patriot soldiers who bore all, suffered all, hoped\r\nall, determined to brave all that their country should be free. From\r\namid that distress Washington sent his thanks for \"the good things\"\r\nBarry sent to the camp.\r\n\r\nWhile the controversy with Hopkinson was being considered and Barry was\r\nin the upper Delaware, he projected the plan to attempt the destruction\r\nof some of the enemy's vessels lying off Philadelphia by floating down\r\nmachines in form of ships' buoys filled with powder. These, as they\r\nfloated past the city, were fired at by the British batteries. This\r\nevent is known in history as \"The Battle of the Kegs.\"\r\n\r\nSingularly, too, Francis Hopkinson, Barry's accuser of want of respect\r\nfor him made the event memorable by a humorous ditty reflecting upon\r\n\"British valor displayed.\"\r\n\r\n   \"The cannons roar from shore to shore,\r\n     The small arms make a rattle;\r\n   Since war's began, I'm sure no man\r\n     E'er saw so strange a battle.\"\r\n\r\nThe Loyalists, however, considered the battle as \"a most astonishing\r\ninstance of the activity, bravery and military skill of the Royal Navy\r\nof Great Britain. Officers and men exhibited the most unparalleled skill\r\nand bravery on the occasion, while the citizens stood as solemn witness\r\nof their prowess.\"\r\n\r\nThis occurred on Monday, January 5, 1778, a day ever distinguished in\r\nhistory for the memorable \"Battle of the Kegs.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n   BARRY ATTACKS THE BRITISH SUPPLY SHIPS BELOW PHILADELPHIA--CAPTURES\r\n   THREE--SENDS SUPPLIES TO WASHINGTON AT VALLEY FORGE--THANKS OF\r\n   WASHINGTON--WAS BARRY OFFERED A BRITISH COMMAND?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe expedition assigned to Captain Barry which he came near being\r\ndeprived of by Congress was a cruise in the Delaware River. The Marine\r\nCommittee, not being directed not to employ Barry, on January 29, 1778,\r\ndirected him to fit out the pinnace and barges belonging to the frigates\r\nfor \"a cruise in said river under your command.\" He was empowered to\r\n\"receive stores and employ such Continental Navy officers and call the\r\nnumber of men necessary for officering, manning, victualing and\r\nequipping the boats.\" He was directed to have frequent occasion to land\r\non each side of the Delaware and to restrain his men from plundering or\r\ninsulting the inhabitants. The Navy Board was directed to supply\r\n\"everything necessary for your little fleet\" and money to procure\r\nsupplies. He was directed to inform General Washington of such stores as\r\nhe might capture which are necessary for the use of the army. He was to\r\nsink or destroy the vessels which he could not remove to safety. His\r\n\"despatch, activity, prudence and valor,\" were relied on to bring\r\nsuccess. If Barry's project to destroy British shipping by explosive\r\nmachines did not succeed, another form of endeavor dependent more upon\r\nskill and bravery would accomplish results as satisfactory as had been\r\nhoped for by the floating \"score of kegs or more that came floating down\r\nthe tide.\"\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Executive Committee of Pennsylvania, then at Lancaster, on\r\nFebruary 7, 1778, notified the Navy Board, then at Burlington, New\r\nJersey, that \"a spirit of enterprise to annoy the enemy in the river\r\nbelow Philadelphia had discovered itself in Captain Barry and other\r\nofficers of the Continental Navy, which promised considerable advantage\r\nto the adventurous as well as to the public.\"\r\n\r\nThe Council had waited to find Captain Barry's example inducing the\r\nofficers and men of the State fleet to engage in the enterprise--of\r\ntaking all they could get from the enemy, so that any benefit arising\r\nfrom the plan should accrue to those who signalized themselves in the\r\ntime of danger. So Captain Barry during the night, with four rowboats\r\nwith twenty-seven men, started from Burlington and succeeded in passing\r\nPhiladelphia undiscovered and so unmolested by the British. Barry was\r\nacting under orders of General Anthony Wayne, a fellow-member of the\r\nFRIENDLY SONS OF ST. PATRICK, who sent a detachment from Washington's\r\narmy to aid in the enterprise. After passing Philadelphia, Barry began\r\nthe destructive work of destroying forage. On February 26, 1778, he\r\narrived off Port Penn and from there, that day, wrote General Washington\r\nat Valley Forge that he had \"destroyed the forage from Mantua Creek to\r\nthis place,\" amounting to four hundred tons. He would have proceeded\r\nfurther but \"a number of the enemy's boats appeared and lined the Jersey\r\nshore, depriving us of the opportunity of proceeding on the same\r\npurpose.\" Barry discharged all but four of Washington's men, whom he\r\nkept to assist in getting the boats away, as his men were rendered\r\nincapable through fatigue.\r\n\r\nOn March 7, 1778, off Bombay Hook, Barry with twenty-seven men in five\r\nrowboats captured the \"Mermaid\" and the \"Kitty,\" transports from Rhode\r\nIsland, laden with supplies for the British. He stripped the vessels and\r\nsent the supplies northward through New Jersey and burned the vessels.\r\nThe \"Alert,\" a British schooner with eight four-pounders, twelve\r\nfour-pound howitzers and thirty-three men properly equipped for an armed\r\nvessel, came in sight while Barry was engaged in the encounter with the\r\nsupply vessels. Barry sent a flag to Captain Morse, of the \"Alert,\"\r\ndemanding a surrender, promising that the officers would be allowed\r\ntheir private baggage, whereupon the \"Alert\" was \"delivered up\" to\r\nCaptain Barry, who granted parole to the Captain to go to Philadelphia\r\nfor a fortnight. \"The schooner is a most excellent vessel for our\r\npurpose,\" wrote Captain Barry to General Washington two days later, when\r\nsending him a \"cheese and a jar of pickled oysters\" from the store of\r\nwines and luxuries intended for General Howe's table. He also sent a\r\nplan of New York \"which may be of service,\" which he had taken on the\r\n\"Alert.\"\r\n\r\nThough a fleet of the enemy's small vessels were in sight, \"I am\r\ndetermined,\" wrote Barry, \"to hold the 'Alert' at all events;\" that as a\r\nnumber of ships with very little convoy were expected Barry declared\r\nthat with about forty more men he could give a very good account of\r\nthem. The next day, March 8, 1778, he reported to the Marine Committee\r\nthe success of the expedition. On the 11th the Committee congratulated\r\nthe \"gallant commander, brave officers and men concerned in it\r\nthroughout the whole cruise.\" He was informed that the \"Alert\" would be\r\npurchased for a cruiser, her name changed to the \"Wasp,\" of which he was\r\nto take command or bestow it on some brave, active and prudent officer\r\non a cruise on the coast and off Cape Henlopen, so as \"to descry the\r\nenemies' vessels coming and going.\" Barry's \"well-known bravery and good\r\nconduct\" were commended. The British \"frigates and small armed vessels,\"\r\nhowever, attacked Barry. After a long and severe engagement he was\r\nobliged to ground and abandon the 'Alert,' though he saved her guns and\r\nmost of her tackle, so Washington reported to Congress on March 12th.\r\n\r\nThat day Washington wrote to Barry:\r\n\r\n\"I have received your favor of the 9th inst. and congratulate you on the\r\nsuccess that has crowned your gallantry and address in the late attacks\r\non the enemy's ships. Although circumstances have prevented you from\r\nreaping the full benefit of your conquests, yet there is ample\r\nconsolation in the degree of glory which you have acquired.\r\n\r\n\"May a suitable recompense always attend your bravery.\"\r\n\r\nAlexander Hamilton, writing to Governor Clinton, of New York, from\r\nWashington's Headquarters, Valley Forge, March 12, 1778, said: \"We have\r\nnothing new in camp save that Captain Barry has destroyed, with a few\r\ngunboats, two large ships belonging to the enemy, laden with forage from\r\nRhode Island. He also took an armed schooner which he has since been\r\nobliged to run ashore after a gallant defense. 'Tis said he has saved\r\nher cannon and stores--among the ordnance four brass howitzers.\"\r\n\r\nBarry with twenty-seven men had captured one major, two captains, three\r\nlieutenants, ten soldiers and one hundred seamen and marines--one\r\nhundred and sixteen taken by twenty-seven. He captured also many letters\r\nand official papers relating to the Hessians in British service, as well\r\nas the Order of _Lion d'Or_ for General Knyphausen. This was sent the\r\nHessian general. Barry's success won the admiration of friend and foe.\r\nIt was at this time Sir William Howe is said to have offered Captain\r\nBarry twenty thousand guineas and the command of a British frigate if he\r\nwould desert the service of the United Colonies. The alleged answer of\r\nBarry is stated to have been: \"Not the value and command of the whole\r\nBritish fleet can seduce me from the cause of my country.\"\r\n\r\nAny such offer, if made, would more probably have been made by Lord\r\nHowe, Commander of the British fleet, brother to General Howe, Commander\r\nof the Army. It is of record that he sent Commodore Hazlewood, of the\r\nPennsylvania Navy, a summons to surrender, to which reply was made that\r\nhe \"would not surrender but defend to the last.\" A like summons to\r\nBarry, Commander of the Continental Navy, doubtless received a similar\r\nreply, but there is no known evidence or authoritative record that Barry\r\nwas tempted to desert his country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WASHINGTON GIVING COMMISSION TO BARRY]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n   PRAISE FOR BARRY'S SUCCESS--BRITISH DESTROY BARRY'S \"EFFINGHAM\" AND\r\n   OTHER VESSELS ON THE UPPER DELAWARE--APPOINTED TO THE\r\n   \"RALEIGH\"--PROTECTS THE COAST FROM NORTH CAROLINA TO\r\n   MASSACHUSETTS--ENCOUNTER WITH TWO BRITISH FRIGATES--BARRY RUNS THE\r\n   \"RALEIGH\" ASHORE--HIS ACTION APPROVED AND HIS BRAVERY DECLARED.\r\n\r\n\r\nBarry's operations on the Delaware were of foremost importance at this\r\nperiod of gloom and darkness. The British were in possession of\r\nPhiladelphia, the Capital of \"the rebels.\" Washington's men were\r\nsuffering the distress of Valley Forge, ill-fed and scantily clothed.\r\nBarry was destroying forage and capturing supplies. General Wayne was\r\noperating around Philadelphia, in Pennsylvania, Delaware and New Jersey\r\nin a like endeavor.\r\n\r\n\"For boldness of design and dexterity of execution, Barry's operations\r\nwere not surpassed, if equaled, during the war,\" says Frost's _Naval\r\nBiography_.\r\n\r\n\"The gallant action reflects great honor on Captain Barry, his officers\r\nand crew,\" wrote William Ellery, one of Massachusetts' delegates in\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nColonel Laurens wrote his father telling of the deeds of Captain Barry,\r\n\"to whom great praise is due.\" Washington reported to Congress \"with\r\ngreat pleasure the success\" of Captain Barry.\r\n\r\nCaptain Barry considered the Delaware Bay \"the best place for meeting\r\nwith success where he could use his little squadron.\" On the upper\r\nDelaware where the \"Effingham,\" \"Washington\" and other Continental\r\nvessels had been sunk, near Bordentown, by order of General Washington,\r\nin April by his orders, also, the Pennsylvania Navy Board, directed that\r\nthe galleys, shallops and brigs be dismantled and sunk, shot buried and\r\nstores lodged throughout New Jersey. All this after \"a rather stubborn\r\ninsistance on the part of the officers\" against so doing, just as\r\nCaptain Barry had protested. Later in the month Barry's \"Effingham,\" the\r\n\"Washington\" and other Continental vessels were raised \"from the soft\r\nbottom of the river,\" but on May 7, 1778, a British force, under Major\r\nMaitland, was sent from Philadelphia and burned twenty-one or more\r\nvessels and naval stores and destroyed all supplies.\r\n\r\nAt this time Captain Barry was in command of the squadron in the lower\r\nDelaware River and in the Bay. By the destruction of the \"Effingham\" in\r\nthe upper Delaware he was without a command other than the temporary one\r\nin which he was operating. Accordingly, on May 30, 1778, the Marine\r\nCommittee appointed him to the command of the frigate \"Raleigh,\" then in\r\nBoston Harbor. He was directed to \"repair immediately to that place\" to\r\ntake command. He succeeded Captain Thomas Thompson, who was charged with\r\nhaving deserted the \"Alfred\" (Barry's old-time \"Black Prince\") in the\r\nbattle with the British frigates \"Ariadne\" and \"Ceres,\" by which the\r\n\"Alfred\" became captive.\r\n\r\nCaptain Barry proceeded to Boston and, taking command of the \"Raleigh,\"\r\nrefitted her for service and went to sea, stopping at Rhode Island,\r\nwhere he received the orders of Marine Committee, on August 24, 1778,\r\nordering him to cruise in company with the Continental brigantine\r\n\"Resistance,\" Captain Burke, between Cape Henlopen and Occracok on the\r\ncoast of North Carolina to intercept British armed vessels infesting\r\nthat coast. On May 28th orders were sent to Hampton, Virginia, for\r\ndelivery to Captain Barry, directing him to take under convoy six or\r\nmore of the vessels loaded with commissary stores and protect them to\r\nthe places of destination. Then he and Captain Burke were to proceed and\r\nprotect the coast line of Virginia and North Carolina, reporting once a\r\nweek at Hampton for orders, which he, as Senior Officer, should\r\ncommunicate to Captain Burke, and also there receive supplies furnished\r\nby the Governor of Virginia.\r\n\r\nCaptain Barry in the \"Raleigh\" cruised along the coast from North\r\nCarolina to Massachusetts Bay. On September 8, 1778, off Boston Bay he\r\nreported to the Marine Committee that many of the guns of the \"Raleigh\"\r\nhad burst in proving and the ship was \"exceedingly foul\" and unfit to\r\nfurther cruise. He was, on September 28, 1778, directed to proceed to\r\nPortsmouth, Virginia, where there was a Continental shipyard, and have\r\nthe \"Raleigh's\" bottom cleaned. That done he was to continue \"to cruise\r\nupon the coast,\" the \"Deane\" or any other vessel with him, Barry was to\r\norder to cruise while the \"Raleigh\" was being cleaned.\r\n\r\nThe Committee had information that the British frigate \"Persius,\" of 32\r\nguns was cruising singly on the coast of South Carolina. Barry was then\r\nordered as soon as his ship was cleaned to extend his cruising ground so\r\nas to cover the coast of that State, taking the \"Deane\" or other vessel\r\nwith him in search of the \"Persius\" and endeavor to \"take, burn, sink or\r\ndestroy\" the said frigate or any other of the enemy's vessels \"that he\r\nmight fall in with.\" If he made a capture he was to take it to\r\nCharleston and there fit, man her and take her on the cruise with him.\r\n\r\nThis order, sent to Hampton, Virginia, did not reach the \"Raleigh\" as,\r\non September 25, 1778, she had sailed from Boston convoying a brigantine\r\nand sloop. That day and the following, two British frigates were seen\r\nbut avoided. The next day--Sunday--the frigates chased the \"Raleigh\"\r\nfrom nine in the morning until five in the afternoon when, nearing each\r\nother, the \"Raleigh\" hoisted her colors and the headmost frigate\r\n\"hoisted St. George's ensign.\" \"We gave her a broadside which she\r\nreturned, tacked and came up on our lee quarter and gave the \"Raleigh\" a\r\nbroadside,\" which carried away its foretopmast and mizzentop gallant\r\nmast, which, to \"the unspeakable grief\" of Captain Barry, caused him,\r\n\"in a great measure, to lose command\" of the \"Raleigh,\" \"determined to\r\nvictory\" as he was. \"The enemy plied his broadsides briskly, which was\r\nreturned as brisk,\" though the \"Raleigh\" \"bore away to prevent the enemy\r\nfrom raking us.\" The British sheered off and dropped astern. During the\r\nnight Barry perceived the stern-most ship gaining on us very fast and,\r\nbeing disabled in our sails, masts and rigging and having no possible\r\nview of escaping, Captain Barry, with the advice of his officers, ran\r\nthe \"Raleigh\" on shore to prevent her falling into the hands of the\r\nenemy. The engagement, however, continued \"very warm until midnight\"--a\r\nfive-hours' contest, when the frigate sheered off to wait the consort.\r\nThe \"Raleigh's\" mizzentopsail had been shot away. Captain Barry ordered\r\nthe other sails cut loose from the yards. The two frigates appeared and\r\nendeavored to cut the \"Raleigh\" \"from the land.\" The headmost ship\r\nproved a two-decker of at least fifty guns. The \"Raleigh,\" \"not in the\r\nleast daunted, received their fire, which was very heavy, and returned\r\nours with redoubled vigor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Encouraged by our brave commander, we were determined not to strike,\"\r\nrelated one of the officers. \"After receiving three broadsides from the\r\nlarge ship and the fire of the other frigate on our lee quarter,\" the\r\n\"Raleigh\" struck the shore, when the enemy poured in two broadsides,\r\nwhich were returned. She then hove in stays, our guns being loaded gave\r\nus a good opportunity of raking her, which we did with our whole\r\nbroadside. After that she bore away and raked us and both British\r\nfrigates kept up a heavy fire in order to make us strike to them, which\r\nwe never did. They ceased and came to anchor a mile distant from the\r\n\"Raleigh.\"\r\n\r\nThe island on which the \"Raleigh\" struck was uninhabited and being rocky\r\ncould not be fortified for the defense of the ship. The enemy kept up an\r\nincessant fire on her and the men being exhausted after the long contest\r\nwith the two frigates, Captain Barry ordered the men to land and the\r\n\"Raleigh\" to be set on fire. The eighty-five men were landed, but the\r\ntreachery of Midshipman Jesse Jaycockt, an Englishman, who extinguished\r\nthe fire, prevented the destruction. The other officers and men were\r\nmade prisoners before the boats could return to take them off.\r\n\r\nThis \"unequal contest with two ships was fought with great gallantry and\r\nthough Captain Barry lost his ship he gained laurels for himself and\r\nhonor for his country. Perhaps no ship was ever better defended,\" wrote\r\nJohn Brown, Secretary of the Navy Board at Boston to the Marine\r\nCommittee of Congress, adding, \"Captain Barry's conduct is highly\r\napproved and his officers and men are greatly pleased with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"His good conduct and bravery are universally allowed,\" said the\r\n_Pennsylvania Post_.\r\n\r\nCaptain Barry \"fought with his usual bravery. His officers and men being\r\nsworn not to surrender, our brave Captain Barry avoided violating his\r\noath by running the 'Raleigh' ashore,\" wrote Colonel John Laurens to his\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nThe British frigates were the \"Experiment,\" of 50 guns, and the\r\n\"Unicorn,\" of 22 guns, or 72 guns against Barry's 32. The latter had ten\r\nmen killed and was greatly damaged in hull and rigging in the contest of\r\nnine hours duration. The \"Raleigh\" lost twenty-five killed and wounded.\r\nThe ship was added to the Royal Navy under the same name. This battle\r\ntook place off Seal Island, or Fox Island, in Penobscot Bay.\r\n\r\nCooper's _History of the Navy_ said, \"Captain Barry gained credit for\r\nhis gallantry on this occasion.\"\r\n\r\n\"A noble and daring defence,\" said Watson's _Annals of Philadelphia_.\r\n\r\nThis disaster left Barry without a ship. The loss, though regrettable,\r\ndid not lessen his reputation as a skillful and sagacious commander nor\r\nmar the character he had won for bravery.\r\n\r\nThe Marine Committee in ordering the Navy Board at Boston to \"order a\r\nCourt of Inquiry on Captain Barry's conduct,\" said: \"The loss of the\r\n'Raleigh' is certainly a very great misfortune, but we have a\r\nconsolation in reflecting that the spirited and gallant behavior of her\r\ncommander has done honor to our flag.\"\r\n\r\nAnd that it held him not censurable is shown by its statement that as\r\n\"Captain Harding has been appointed to the command of the frigate at\r\nNorwich named the 'Confederacy,' which prevents our giving that ship to\r\nCaptain Barry.\"\r\n\r\nThe Committee was ready at once to give him another command had a vessel\r\nbeen ready for him. That too without waiting the action of the Court of\r\nInquiry, which it had ordered. But the Committee had soon occasion to\r\ngive an appointment which showed the estimation in which his abilities\r\nwere held as the foremost naval commander, worthy to be entrusted with\r\nits best commands and ships.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ORDER TO CAPTAIN BARRY]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n   BARRY APPOINTED TO COMMAND AN EXPEDITION AGAINST FLORIDA--EXPEDITION\r\n   ABANDONED, BARRY ENTERS THE PENNSYLVANIA PRIVATEER SERVICE--MAKES\r\n   CAPTURES--RESISTS THE IMPRISONMENT OF HIS CREW--\"MY NAME IS JOHN\r\n   BARRY.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThat the loss of the \"Raleigh\" brought no discredit upon Captain Barry,\r\nbut rather added to his reputation as a brave and skillful commander is\r\nattested by the action of the Marine Committee in appointing him to\r\ncommand an expedition against East Florida.\r\n\r\nMajor-General Lincoln was to command the Continental and State army\r\nforces in the reduction of St. Augustine, Florida, as it \"was of the\r\nhighest importance to the United States.\"\r\n\r\nOn November 10, 1778, Congress Resolved:\r\n\r\n\"That Captain John Barry be and is hereby directed to take command of\r\nall armed vessels employed in the intended expedition, subject to the\r\norder of the Commander-in-Chief in the Southern Department; and that\r\nthis commission continue in force till the expedition of the intended\r\ninvasion of the Province of East Florida or till the further order of\r\nCongress; that he proceed with the utmost despatch to the State of\r\nMaryland in order to expedite the equipment of the gallies to be\r\nfurnished by that State and proceed with them to Charleston in South\r\nCarolina.\"\r\n\r\nAt Charleston armed gallies from Virginia were to be joined. \"The\r\nsuccess of the expedition depended in the most essential manner on their\r\nservice.\" The Continental share of all property taken would be released\r\nto the captors.\r\n\r\nTo prevent difference among officers of the respective States whose\r\ngallies would be employed, Captain John Barry was appointed to command\r\nthe naval part of the expedition. Captain Barry \"made some extraordinary\r\ndemands upon Congress for allowance of a table and a secretary, which\r\nthe House did not determine on,\" wrote Henry Laurens, President of\r\nCongress, to General Lincoln; adding that \"though Captain Barry is a\r\nbrave and active seaman, the intended service is not pleasing to him,\r\n'tis possible, therefore, he may wish to avoid it and besides you will\r\nfind old commanders in the two Southern States who will be much\r\nmortified should he actually proceed and take the command of them,\r\nconsequences will arise which will be disagreeable to you and which may\r\nprove detrimental to the service.\"\r\n\r\nThe British probably became aware of the intended invasion and so\r\norganized a counter-movement against General Lincoln and obliged him to\r\ndefend his occupancy of Charleston. General Clinton, on December 26,\r\n1778, sailed from New York and a month later, delayed by storms, reached\r\nSavannah, the base of his operations against Lincoln. This obliged\r\nCongress to abandon its projected expedition against East Florida. So\r\nCaptain Barry's \"extraordinary demands\" or the jealousies of the\r\nSouthern naval officers were, by the course of events, set aside. The\r\naggressive movement of Sir Henry Clinton had frustrated the intended\r\ninvasion and so all the minor considerations involved therein.\r\n\r\nBut the high esteem in which Barry was held was proven by the\r\nappointment to command the expedition and this, too, immediately after\r\nthe loss of the \"Raleigh.\" His defense of the \"Raleigh\" was so bravely\r\nperformed that the appointment to the Southern expedition was given him\r\nas the best testimonial of worth and of fidelity to duty. The loss of\r\nthe \"Raleigh\" and the abandonment of the invasion of East Florida left\r\nCaptain John Barry without an available Continental ship. But such a\r\nbrave and active seaman could not be listless nor idle while an\r\nopportunity could be found or made for doing service for his country.\r\nWhen the \"Effingham\" and other vessels were tied up in the Delaware,\r\nCaptain Barry became a landsman and did shore duty, leading a company of\r\nvolunteers in the Trenton and Princeton campaign.\r\n\r\nNow that his country had no ship to give him to do duty for America, he\r\nentered the service of his adopted State, Pennsylvania, and became \"a\r\nbold privateer\" by becoming commander of the Letter-of-Marque, the brig\r\n\"Delaware,\" owned by Irwin & Co., of Philadelphia. His commission bears\r\ndate of February 15, 1779. It is in the Lenox Library, New York.\r\n\r\nThe \"Delaware\" was a new brig of 200 tons, built to replace the schooner\r\nof the same name, which had been driven on the New Jersey shore and set\r\non fire to escape the British early on the morning of November 21, 1777,\r\nwhen the State's Navy had passed up the Delaware River after the attack\r\non Fort Mifflin.\r\n\r\nThe new \"Delaware\" carried ten guns and forty-five men when\r\ncommissioned, but Captain Barry increased the force to twelve guns and\r\nsixty men.\r\n\r\nThe day he was commissioned he stood sponsor and his wife a witness to\r\nthe baptism of Anna, daughter of Thomas, his brother, born on that\r\nmorning. On July 21st following, Captain Barry's wife, Sarah Austin\r\nBarry, became a Catholic and was baptised, conditionally, Anna Barry,\r\nwife of Thomas, being the only sponsor. At this time Captain Barry was\r\ncruising in the West Indies. Judith, \"the slave of Captain John Barry,\"\r\nan adult, was also baptised on August 19, 1779.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Delaware\" Captain Barry made two cruises to Port-au-Prince. Of\r\nhis first voyage no record has been discovered, but of his second there\r\nis sufficient in the account given by his Mate, John Kessler. The\r\n\"Delaware\" sailed on its second cruise in the fall of 1779 in company\r\nwith three other Letter-of-Marque brigs and one schooner. Of this fleet\r\nCaptain Barry was made Commodore. He was always so appointed whenever\r\ntwo or more vessels were assigned to one cruise or expedition in which\r\nhe engaged. When abreast of Cape Henlopen the British sloop-of-war the\r\n\"Harlem,\" with eighty-five men and fourteen four-pounders, was taken\r\nwithout resistance, though the officers escaped in boats after heaving\r\noverboard all the guns.\r\n\r\nThe \"Harlem\" was sent to Philadelphia. The crew was delivered to the\r\nmilitia at Chincopague. Captain Barry reported to the owners that \"the\r\ncommanders in our little fleet are very complaisant and obliging to each\r\nother.\" That the \"Harlem\" had fourteen four-pounders and eighty-five\r\nmen. The guns and other things were thrown overboard without firing a\r\nshot. The Captain, with ten men, went off in a whale-boat, \"but,\"\r\nreported Captain Barry, \"we have reason to think, is since overset.\" The\r\nprisoners were taken out, a prize crew put on board, the \"Harlem\" sent\r\nto Philadelphia and the men landed at Sinipaxan, Virginia, as they were\r\ntoo many to keep with safety on board the little fleet. \"We have every\r\nreason in the world to think we shall catch more before long,\" reported\r\nBarry. The \"Harlem\" was \"a fine vessel and had been a cruiser since the\r\nenemy took New York, but at present she is much out of tune,\" he added.\r\n\r\nOf the rest of the voyage out and home nothing specially noteworthy\r\noccurred except that a merchant ship from Liverpool was captured and\r\nlater retaken by the noted Goodrich and carried into Bermuda.\r\n\r\nDuring the war there was often contention between the commanders of the\r\nContinental and those of the States' service. The Continentals, when in\r\nneed of men, often impressed the seamen of the States' fleet and also\r\nthose of merchant vessels. On Captain Barry's return to the Delaware\r\nRiver the Continental frigate \"Confederacy\" lay at Chester. She had been\r\nimpressing the crews of merchant vessels coming up the river. The pilot\r\ngave this information to the crew of the \"Delaware.\" It alarmed them\r\nvery much and many desired to be put on shore. Captain Barry addressed\r\nthem saying, \"My lads, if you have the spirit of freemen you will not\r\ndesire to go ashore nor tamely submit against your wills to be taken\r\naway, although all the force of all the frigate's boats' crew were to\r\nattempt to exercise such a species of tyranny.\" This address, records\r\nKessler, satisfied them, as it implied his consent to their defending\r\nthemselves. They resolved to do it at all hazards, and for that purpose\r\nput themselves under the command and direction of the boatswain and\r\narmed themselves with muskets, pistols and boarding pikes, and thus\r\narrived within hailing distance of the \"Confederacy.\" Her commander\r\nordered the brig's maintopsail to be hove to the mast. Captain Barry\r\nanswered that he could not without getting his vessel ashore. The\r\ncommander of the frigate then ordered that the brig should come to\r\nanchor.\r\n\r\nCaptain Barry gave no answer but continued on his way, beating up with\r\ntide and flood and wind, when a gun was fired from the frigate and a\r\nboat, manned, left her and came towards the \"Delaware.\" Captain Barry\r\ndirected that the officers of the boat should be admitted on board, but\r\nas to the men with them, the \"Delaware's\" crew could do as they pleased.\r\nThe boat soon arrived and two officers, armed, jumped on board and on\r\nthe quarterdeck, ordering the maintopsail halyards to be cast off,\r\nwhich, however, was not done. Captain Barry asked whether they were sent\r\nto take command of his vessel. The boat's crew were about coming on\r\nboard when the \"Delaware's\" men threatened instant death to all who came\r\non board.\r\n\r\nThe officers after trying to intimidate our boatswain by presenting\r\ntheir pistols at him, and finding it of no avail, hastily sprang into\r\ntheir boats and left.\r\n\r\nAnother gun was fired from the \"Confederacy.\" Captain Barry ordered the\r\nguns cleared and declared that if a rope-yard was injured he would give\r\nthe \"Confederacy\" a whole broadside. A third gun was fired. Captain\r\nBarry hailed and asked the name of the commander of the frigate.\r\n\r\nThe answer was \"Lieutenant Gregory.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Barry addressed him: \"Lieutenant Gregory, I advise you to desist\r\nfrom firing. This is the brig 'Delaware,' belonging to Philadelphia and\r\nmy name is John Barry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing further was said or done by Lieutenant Gregory,\" recorded Mate\r\nKessler, who added: \"Our whole crew arrived at Philadelphia, but the\r\nother vessels of our fleet were obliged to anchor, as the pressing of\r\nthose who did not get on shore obliged them to remain until assistance\r\nwas sent from Philadelphia. After our arrival Barry left the command of\r\nthe brig, he having been ordered to take charge of a Continental 74-gun\r\nship then building in the State of New Hampshire,\" relates Kessler.\r\nJames Collins, First Lieutenant, became Captain Barry's successor in\r\ncommand of the \"Delaware,\" which had taken two prizes, the distribution\r\nof which was made among the officers and crew, Kessler receiving \"in the\r\nthreefold capacity of clerk, steward and captain of marines.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n   CAPTAIN BARRY APPOINTED TO SUPERINTEND THE BUILDING OF THE \"AMERICA,\"\r\n   FRIGATE--GIVEN COMMAND OF THE \"ALLIANCE\" AS SUCCESSOR OF LANDAIS, THE\r\n   FRENCHMAN--THE DISCOVERY OF ARNOLD'S TREASON--\"WHOM CAN WE TRUST\r\n   NOW?\"--THE ANSWER TO ARNOLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Continental 74 to which Captain Barry was sent immediately on his\r\narrival at Philadelphia in the \"Delaware\" was the frigate \"America,\"\r\nthen building at Portsmouth, New Hampshire. To this command he was\r\nappointed on November 6, 1779, by the Marine Committee of Congress,\r\nwhich that day notified the Navy Board at Boston that Captain Barry on\r\nhis way to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where he goes to hasten the\r\nbuilding and fitting out of the new ship on the stocks at that place,\r\nwould present the notification desiring the Committee to \"push forward\r\nwith all possible expedition\" the work Captain Barry had been entrusted\r\nwith. Barry's orders were \"to hasten as much as may be in your power the\r\ncompleting of that ship, which we are desirous of having done with all\r\ndespatch.\"\r\n\r\nOn November 20th, as desired by Captain Barry, Captain George Jerry\r\nOsborne was appointed to command the marines of the ship, but as it\r\nwould be \"a considerable time before there is occasion to raise the\r\nmen,\" he was appointed \"on the principle of his being useful in doing\r\nmatters relative to the ship until that time.\" How long Captain Barry\r\ncontinued to superintend the building of the new Continental ship--later\r\nnamed the \"America,\" does not appear, but on June 1, 1780, there is\r\nrecord in the _Pennsylvania Archives_ [Vol. I, 5th Series] that Captain\r\nJohn Barry became the commander of the Pennsylvania privateer, the\r\n\"American,\" of 14 guns and 70 men. Possibly the work of directing the\r\nconstruction of a vessel was not congenial to the active spirit of one\r\nwho was at his best amid the more earnest exertions required by a life\r\nat sea, seeking the destruction or capture of the armed vessels of the\r\nenemy. So again he became a privateersman in the service of his State.\r\nHe so served three months.\r\n\r\nOn June 26, 1781, Captain John Paul Jones was appointed, in succession\r\nto Barry, to superintend the construction of the \"America,\" while Barry\r\nwas doing service at sea in command of the \"Alliance.\" The expense of\r\nlaunching and equipping the \"America\" was paid from the shares of the\r\nUnited States \"in the prizes taken by Captain Barry\" in the first cruise\r\nof the \"Alliance\" under his command. The Board of Admiralty were\r\ndirected to assign these shares to Robert Morris by Resolution of\r\nCongress, June 3, 1781. The \"America\" when launched in November, 1781,\r\nwas presented to France to replace the \"Magnifique,\" wrecked in Boston\r\nHarbor.\r\n\r\nThe Continental Marine Committee, knowing well Barry's worth, on\r\nSeptember 5, 1780, appointed him \"to the command of the Continental\r\nfrigate 'Alliance' now in the port of Boston.\" He was \"directed to\r\nrepair there as soon as possible to get the ship ready for sea with all\r\npossible despatch.\" The \"Alliance\" was the largest and finest vessel of\r\nthe Continental Navy.\r\n\r\nThus we see again that the best available position was always given to\r\nCaptain Barry. The first armed cruiser under direct Continental\r\nauthority--the \"Lexington\"--was given him, then the \"Effingham,\" of 32\r\nguns, the largest armament of any vessel, was assigned him, and he was\r\nmade Senior Commander of the Port of Philadelphia. On its destruction by\r\nthe British, while he was operating in the lower Delaware, he was\r\nappointed to the \"Raleigh.\" On its loss, for which Captain Barry\r\nsuffered no detriment, he was made commander of the projected expedition\r\nto Florida. When that enterprise was abandoned he was given command of a\r\nfleet of the Navy of Pennsylvania. At the termination of the cruise the\r\nappointment to construct the best vessel the country had projected was\r\ngiven him. Then he was commissioned to the \"Alliance,\" the best and\r\nfinest vessel the United Colonies ever possessed. In that he remained as\r\ncommander while the war continued, and at its close he was Commodore of\r\nall armed vessels remaining in the service of the Colonies, just as\r\nWashington was Commander-in-Chief of all the forces, military and naval,\r\nat the end of the war. As commander of the fleet, Barry was second to\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nThe \"Alliance,\" which Captain Barry took charge of in September, 1780,\r\nwas so named in honor of the alliance with France. As a further\r\ncompliment to the French, Captain Pierre Landais, a Frenchman, had been\r\nappointed Captain. He was relieved of the command and Captain Barry\r\nsucceeded him. These were the only commanders the \"Alliance\" ever\r\nhad--Landais the Frenchman and Barry the Irishman. Landais is buried in\r\nSt. Patrick's cemetery, New York; Barry in St. Mary's, Philadelphia. One\r\nin faith and one in endeavor for our country.\r\n\r\nThe \"Alliance\" was the only American vessel in the expedition sent out\r\nby King Louis XVI, under John Paul Jones, which resulted in the ever\r\nmemorable encounter with, and capture of, the \"Serapis\" by the \"Bonne\r\nHomme Richard,\" commanded by Captain John Paul Jones. During the battle\r\nthe \"Alliance\" twice fired into Jones' vessel and did damage. For this,\r\non arrival in France, he was called on to make explanations and John\r\nPaul Jones, as Commodore of all American vessels in Europe, was\r\nappointed by Commissioner Benjamin Franklin, on June 16, 1780, to take\r\n\"command of the 'Alliance' in her present intended voyage to America.\"\r\nBut Silas Deane supported Landais, who ordered Jones off the vessel and\r\nset sail for America. On the voyage, his mental faculties becoming more\r\nerratic, the officers took the command from him and entrusted it to\r\nLieutenant James Degges.\r\n\r\nOn arrival at Boston, Captain Barry was appointed to the command and the\r\nCourts of Inquiry and Courts-Martial tried Landais and dismissed him\r\nfrom the service. He died in New York in 1818 and is buried in St.\r\nPatrick's graveyard.\r\n\r\nCaptain Barry now commanded \"the most perfect piece of naval\r\narchitecture\" than which the navies of France or England had none more\r\ncomplete. Landais and Barry were the only duly commissioned and\r\nregularly appointed by Continental authority commanders of the\r\n\"Alliance,\" who at sea, on voyage or in battle ever directed her\r\noperations, yet a block of timber of the \"Alliance\" exhibited in the\r\nRevolutionary Relic Museum at Independence Hall is inscribed: \"Commanded\r\nby John Paul Jones during the Revolutionary War.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no mention of its chief commander, John Barry, and that\r\nignoring of his right to recognition is within sight of his statue\r\nerected by THE FRIENDLY SONS OF ST. PATRICK, of Philadelphia, March 16,\r\n1907. Let that Society now secure the Commodore's right to the command\r\nhis country gave him.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of Captain Barry had special significance at the time it\r\nwas made--after the discovery of the treason of Benedict Arnold. He had\r\nissued on October 7, 1780, an \"Address to the Soldiers of the American\r\nArmy,\" in which he declared he thought \"it infinitely wiser and safer to\r\ncast his confidence upon Great Britain's justice and generosity than to\r\ntrust a monarchy too feeble to establish your Independence, so perilous\r\nto her distant dominions and the enemy of the Protestant faith.\"\r\n\r\nWashington, in almost faint-hearted despair on the discovery of Arnold's\r\ntreachery, had asked: \"Whom can we trust now?\" Was the answer to\r\nWashington and Arnold that made by the Marine Committee of the\r\nContinental Congress by the appointment of Captain John Barry to the\r\nlargest, finest and best American war-vessel named in honor of an\r\nalliance with France, the alleged \"enemy of the Protestant faith,\" as\r\nArnold had declared?\r\n\r\nWas that the answer to Arnold by the Congress whom he had denounced \"as\r\nmean and profligate\" and \"praying a soul out of purgatory,\" because the\r\nmembers had attended the Requiem service in St. Mary's Church,\r\nPhiladelphia, in behalf of the soul of Don Juan de Miralles, the Spanish\r\nAgent to the Congress, and in the very church which Captain Barry\r\nattended when in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThe Irish-born Catholic, John Barry, could be trusted with the very best\r\nwhen the native-born Protestant, Arnold, had betrayed the country for\r\npelf and position among the oppressors of the native land of John Barry\r\nand the native land of the infamous Benedict Arnold.\r\n\r\nWhat more could the adopted land of John Barry do for one who had been\r\nso faithful and so helpful from the first day of opportunity to serve\r\nher? It will erect a monument at the Capital of the Nation for America\r\nas Ireland's SONS OF ST. PATRICK have erected one at Independence Hall.\r\nHis new country had given him the first, and at all times the best, she\r\nhad to bestow, as his native land had given to America. Place of birth\r\nnor creed of faith made no disparagement of such superior worth as John\r\nBarry possessed.\r\n\r\nThe Congress that had, to the people of Great Britain, denounced Barry's\r\nreligion as \"one fraught with impiety, bloodshed, rapine and murder in\r\nevery part of the globe,\" had given to the Irish-born Catholic who gave\r\nthe best he possessed in talent, ability and service to the cause of\r\nAmerica, had also given him the first of her war vessels, continued to\r\ngive him the best she, too, possessed and, finally, while the\r\nnative-born traitor almost paralyzed the hearts of the patriots, gave to\r\nthe foreign-born and staunch Catholic, the foremost vessel in her navy,\r\none \"so swift, so warlike, stout and strong,\" as to be the admiration of\r\nEurope's most expert naval commanders, while America had dismissed from\r\nher service, as incompetent, the native-born Esek Hopkins, the first\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Navy of the Colony. It is somewhat singular,\r\ntherefore, that the foremost naval commanders of the Navy during the\r\nRevolutionary War were John Barry, of Ireland, and John Paul Jones, of\r\nScotland--\"foreigners,\" as John Adams spoke of both in 1813.\r\n\r\nThe lines of the Poet of the Revolution, Philip Freneau, may most\r\nappropriately be inserted here, to show the regard in which the vessel\r\nwas held while John Barry was its commander:\r\n\r\n   \"When she unfurls her flowing sails,\r\n   Undaunted by the fiercest gales,\r\n   In dreadful pomp she plows the main,\r\n   While adverse tempests rage in vain.\r\n   When she displays her gloomy tier,\r\n   The boldest Britons freeze with fear,\r\n   And, owning her superior might,\r\n   Seek their best safety in their flight.\r\n   But when she pours the dreadful blaze\r\n   And thunder from her cannon plays,\r\n   The bursting flash that wings the ball,\r\n   Compels those foes to strike or fall.\"\r\n\r\n\"She was in many engagements and always victorious--a fortunate ship--a\r\nremarkably fast sailer--could always choose her combat--could either\r\nfight or run away--always beating her adversary by fight or flight,\"\r\nPhiladelphia's annalist, Watson, made that record of her.\r\n\r\nSuch was the vessel commanded by Captain John Barry, the Wexford boy, in\r\nthe closing and eventful year of the Revolution, which established our\r\ncountry's Independence and Liberty, to become the home of countless\r\nthousands of all lands who might enjoy the Liberties John Barry had so\r\nconspicuously aided in winning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n   THE \"ALLIANCE\" SAILS FOR FRANCE--CAPTURES A BRITISH CRUISER--RETURN\r\n   TO AMERICA--THE LOSS OF THE \"LA FAYETTE\"--MUTINY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe selection of John Barry, at this crisis in our country's struggle\r\nfor Liberty and Independence, to the command of the foremost ship of the\r\nnew Republic is a most conspicuous and honorable testimony to his\r\nmerits, abilities and services. None additional is needed.\r\n\r\nThe \"Alliance\" was selected to convey Colonel John Laurens as a special\r\nCommissioner to France to seek \"an immediate, ample and efficacious\r\nsuccor in money, large enough to be a foundation for substantial\r\narrangement of finance, to revive public credit and give vigor to future\r\noperations.\"\r\n\r\nThere was delay in sailing owing to a shortness of crew and the\r\ninability to procure recruits. In the meantime Captain Barry was, on\r\nNovember 10, 1780, appointed, by the Navy Board of the Eastern\r\nDepartment, President of a Court-Martial, together with Captains\r\nHoystead Hucker, Samuel Nicholson and Henry Johnson, Lieutenants Silas\r\nDevol, Patrick Fletcher, Nicholas E. Gardner and Samuel Pritchard,\r\nLieutenant of Marine, to meet on November 21st to try Lieutenant James\r\nDegges to determine whether he was justified in revolting against the\r\nauthority of Captain Landais of the \"Alliance\" and usurping command on\r\nthe voyage from France. A Court-Martial was also held for the trial of\r\nCaptain Landais, and he was dismissed the service. There is much\r\ninteresting history connected with these trials, but they do not\r\nproperly enter into this recital further than to say that Captain\r\nLandais' erratic conduct in command of the \"Alliance\" was due to mental\r\ndeficiencies as was afterwards generally acknowledged. These became so\r\nmanifest in the voyage to America that the officers took the command\r\nfrom him.\r\n\r\nOn February 2, 1781, so impatient at the delay had become Colonel\r\nLaurens that, as all other resources had failed, he applied to General\r\nBenjamin Lincoln to allow recruits for the army fitted for marine\r\nservice to be engaged and nowhere so advantageously employed.\r\n\r\nPatrick Sheridan, an enlisted soldier of Boston, is one known to have\r\nbeen given leave to join the \"Alliance.\" On February 11, 1781, the\r\n\"Alliance\" sailed from Boston with Colonel Laurens, Thomas Paine, Comte\r\nde Noailles, brother-in-law of Lafayette and other celebrities. On the\r\nway to France the \"Alliance\" captured, on March 4th, the British cruiser\r\n\"Alert,\" which had possession of the \"La Buonia Compagnia,\" a Venetian\r\nship which, \"contrary to the Laws of Nations and every principle of\r\njustice\" had been seized by the British cruiser called the \"Alert\" from\r\nGlasgow, Francis Russell commander, by whom the Venetian crew were put\r\nin irons and otherwise cruelly treated.\r\n\r\nCaptain Barry released the Venetian \"out of respect for the Laws of\r\nNations and the rights of neutrality.\" Colonel Laurens in reporting to\r\nCongress, from L'Orient, March 11, 1781, where the \"Alliance\" had\r\narrived two days before, related the action of Captain Barry, whereupon\r\non June 26th it was resolved that Congress approve of Captain Barry's\r\nconduct in releasing the ship belonging to the Republic of Venice,\r\nretaken by him from a British privateer on March 4th last, it being the\r\ndetermination always to pay the utmost respect to the rights of neutral\r\ncommerce. The Venetian Senate also expressed to Franklin, our Ambassador\r\nat Paris, through the Ambassador of Venice, their \"grateful sense of the\r\nfriendly behavior of Captain Barry, commander of the 'Alliance,' in\r\nrescuing one of the ships of their State from an English privateer and\r\nsetting her at liberty.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked as a singular circumstance that the \"Alert\" was,\r\nprobably, the cruiser which, on September 10, 1777, had captured Barry's\r\nfirst command, the \"Lexington,\" which was then commanded by Captain\r\nHenry Johnson and which Barry had, in March, 1778, captured in the\r\nDelaware Bay, but which was retaken by the British a few days later and\r\nwhich, on September 17, 1778, captured the American cruiser \"La\r\nFayette.\" If so, Captain Barry's gratification must have been great in\r\nagain capturing the \"Alert.\"\r\n\r\nThe importance of Captain Barry's services in this voyage must be noted.\r\nHe succeeded in conveying to France Colonel Laurens, whose father had\r\nbeen sent on a similar mission, but had been taken prisoner while on the\r\nway, and at the time of his son's going on the same mission was a\r\nprisoner in the Tower at London. Captain Barry's responsibility was,\r\ntherefore, great. Skill and acuteness were most essential to avoid\r\nencounter with a superior British force and thus endanger the safety of\r\nthe special Commissioner charged with so important a duty at this\r\n\"infinitely critical posture of our affairs,\" as Washington wrote\r\nFranklin.\r\n\r\nTo promptly and safely convey Colonel Laurens was more important to the\r\ngeneral good than for Barry to make captures and prizes. Yet he not only\r\nperformed the duty assigned him, but took two prizes from the enemy--its\r\n\"Alert\" and its own prize, the Venetian ship, restoring it to its\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nBarry's captures were, in notable cases, double captives, taking two in\r\neach encounter. On the Delaware Bay expedition he had taken the\r\n\"Mermaid\" and the \"Kitty,\" which he held and the \"Alert\" which was\r\nretaken. Now we find him taking that \"Alert\" and its prize. These double\r\ncaptures we shall, later, see repeated--taking two prizes in one\r\nbattle--killing two birds with one stone, as it were. And it took two\r\nBritish cruisers to inflict the only loss he ever had--the loss of the\r\n\"Raleigh.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Barry took the \"Alert\" to L'Orient, where the crew were\r\nimprisoned. Laurens secured from France a gift of six millions from the\r\nKing--as well as clothing and military stores. It was sent in the\r\n\"Resolute\" which sailed from Brest, June 1, 1781, and arrived at Boston\r\nAugust 25th. It was this money which moved Washington's army to\r\nYorktown, Virginia, by paying the army one month's pay in specie and\r\nenabling supplies to be furnished. Congress had no credit to get money\r\nor supplies until the arrival of the French funds. Other portions of the\r\nmoney were used to pay overdue French loans. That was our hard-pressed\r\ncountry's method of paying its debts.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the duty assigned Captain Barry to get Colonel Laurens\r\nto France is thus made manifest. Well performed, its results brought the\r\ndownfall of British supremacy in America. Failure to safely convey\r\nLaurens would have brought untold disaster upon the cause of\r\nIndependence and Liberty and, mayhap, long have delayed the winning and\r\nthe triumph.\r\n\r\nOn March 23, 1781, Captain Barry, after obtaining supplies needed, was\r\nassigned the Letter-of-Marque vessel \"Marquis de La Fayette,\" commanded\r\nby Captain Gallatheau, which was loaded with stores for Congress, and\r\ndirected that, as he was about to return to America, that the \"La\r\nFayette\" would proceed under his convoy to Philadelphia. On March 29th\r\nthe \"Alliance\" and \"La Fayette\" sailed from L'Orient in company.\r\n\r\nWhen the \"Alliance\" left L'Orient on her returning cruise to America,\r\nCaptain Barry, by orders of Franklin, directed Captain Gallatheau, of\r\nthe ship \"Marquis La Fayette,\" to proceed to the United States under\r\nconvoy of the \"Alliance,\" as the vessel was laden with one hundred tons\r\nof saltpetre, twenty-six iron eighteen-pounders, fifteen thousand\r\ngunbarrels, leather, uniforms for ten thousand men and cloth for five or\r\nsix thousand. After being under convoy for three weeks in a gale of wind\r\nwhich split the sails of the \"Alliance,\" the \"La Fayette\" disappeared.\r\nCaptain Barry gave signals by flags and guns and cruised about for two\r\ndays in search of the missing vessel. Five days after the separation the\r\n\"Suffolk,\" British man-of-war, of 74 guns, met the \"La Fayette\" and\r\nafter three hours' battle made her captive though reduced to \"a perfect\r\nhulk.\" For thirteen days she was towed by the \"Suffolk.\"\r\n\r\nInvestigation made by Congress into the cause of this great loss showed,\r\nby the evidence of Captain Robeson, on board the \"La Fayette,\" that the\r\nseparation was the fault of Captain Gallatheau by sailing away from the\r\n\"Alliance\" contrary to every argument of Captain Robeson. The loss\r\naggregated four hundred and fifty tons of public stores and two hundred\r\nmen, besides the armament of twenty-six eighteen-pound guns and fourteen\r\nsix-pounders.\r\n\r\nOn March 30th a mutiny plot was discovered among the crew of the\r\n\"Alliance.\" It is best related in the words of Kessler, Barry's friend\r\nand officer:\r\n\r\n\"An Indian, one of the forecastle men, gave Captain Barry information of\r\na combination among the crew for the purpose of taking the ship, and\r\npointed out three who had striven to prevail on him to be concerned\r\ntherein. The three men were immediately put in irons and all the\r\nofficers, with such of the crew as could be confided in, were armed and\r\nrequired to remain all night on deck. On the next morning all hands were\r\ncalled and placed on the forecastle, booms and gangways, excepting the\r\nofficers and such part of the crew in whom Captain Barry confided, who,\r\narmed strongly, guarded the quarterdeck, the steerage and the main deck\r\nto keep the remainder of the crew together on the forecastle and boom.\r\nThe three designated men were brought out of their irons on the\r\nquarterdeck, and being stripped and hoisted by the thumbs to the\r\nmizzen-stay, underwent a very severe whipping before either would make\r\nany confession. As their accomplices were disclosed they were called to\r\nthe quarterdeck, stripped and tied to the ridge-rope of the netting and\r\nthe whipping continued until it was thought all was disclosed that could\r\npossibly be obtained, which proved to be: that it was intended to take\r\nthe ship on her passage out by killing all the officers in the middle of\r\nthe watch of the night, except Lieutenant Patrick Fletcher who was to\r\nnavigate her to some port in Ireland, or, on failure, to be destroyed. A\r\nquartermaster, one of the mutineers, was to have command. They all had\r\nbeen bound by an oath on the Bible, administered by the Captain's\r\nassistant cabin steward, and had also signed their names in a\r\nround-robin, so-called, but that they found no opportunity on the\r\noutward passage and intended to accomplish taking of the ship as\r\naforesaid immediately on leaving France. But on coming out of L'Orient\r\nwe lost a man overboard who was one of the chief ring-leaders, and they,\r\nconsidering that as a bad omen, threw the round-robin overboard and\r\nrelinquished their designs. The three principals were placed securely in\r\nirons and the remainder, after being admonished by Captain Barry, and on\r\ntheir solemn declaration to conduct themselves well, were permitted to\r\nreturn to ship's duty. This mutiny was discovered Sunday, March 31,\r\n1781.\"\r\n\r\nOn April 2d two British armed cruisers were seen at seven in the\r\nmorning. The \"Alliance\" gave chase and the two Britishers \"stood for\"\r\nthe \"Alliance.\" They neared each other at ten o'clock when the two gave\r\nthe \"Alliance\" a broadside, which was \"returned double-fold\" so\r\neffectively that one struck her flag and hove to. She was the \"Mars,\" of\r\ntwenty twelve-pounders, two sixes and twelve four-pounders and one\r\nhundred and eleven men. The other ran while the \"Alliance\" \"fired a\r\nnumber of bow chasers at her\" and in an hour hove to and surrendered.\r\nShe was the \"Minerva,\" mounting eight four-pounders and fifty-five men.\r\nThe \"Alliance\" received \"considerable damage\" from the shot of the\r\nenemy. Lieutenant Fletcher and fourteen men were placed in charge of the\r\n\"Minerva\" as a prize crew. Here again in one battle Captain Barry\r\ncaptures two of the enemy's cruisers. The \"Alliance\" continued the\r\ncruise and went to the West India waters seeking prizes.\r\n\r\nOn May 2d a brig and a snow (a small vessel) loaded with sugar from\r\nJamaica for London were captured and being manned from the \"Alliance\"\r\nwas ordered to Boston. Again two captures. Later in the day a fleet of\r\nsixty-five sail, convoyed by ten sail of line, were observed but\r\nprudently not molested by Captain Barry. Later in the day a brig from\r\nJamaica bound to Bristol, England. We \"gave the brig two bow guns at\r\nmeridian,\" notes the log of the \"Alliance.\" She surrendered. \"Sent our\r\nboats, on board and took the prisoners out.\" The next day another\r\nvessel, with seven four-pounders also from Jamaica to Bristol, was taken\r\nand the prisoners brought on board the \"Alliance.\"\r\n\r\nNot until May 28th was there another opportunity found, when early on\r\nthat morning an armed ship and a brig were discovered about a league\r\ndistant. At sunrise they hoisted the English colors and beat drums. At\r\nthe same time Captain Barry displayed the American colors. By eleven\r\no'clock Captain Barry hailed the ship and was answered that she was the\r\n\"Atalanta\" ship-of-war belonging to His Britannic Majesty, commanded by\r\nCaptain Sampson Edwards. Captain Barry then told Captain Edwards that\r\nhe, John Barry, commanded the Continental frigate the \"Alliance\" and\r\nadvised him to haul down the English colors.\r\n\r\nCaptain Edwards replied, \"Thank you, Sir. Perhaps I may after a trial.\"\r\n\r\nThe firing then began. The \"Alliance\" had not wind enough for steerage\r\nway. The enemy being lighter vessels, by using sweeps, got and kept\r\nathwart the stern of the \"Alliance\" so that she could not bring half her\r\nguns to bear upon them, and often but one gun out astern to bear on the\r\ntwo--thus lying like a log the greater part of the time. Captain Barry\r\nreceived a wound in the shoulder from a grape shot. He remained on the\r\nquarterdeck until exhausted by loss of blood, when he was helped to the\r\ncock-pit for treatment. Soon the colors of the \"Alliance\" were shot\r\naway. This caused the enemy to believe the Americans had struck their\r\ncolors. They gave three cheers and manned their shrouds expecting a\r\nsurrender. But the colors of the \"Alliance\" were again run up--a breeze\r\nsprung up--a broadside was given the \"Atalanta\" and another given the\r\n\"Trepassy,\" the brig. They then struck their colors to the \"Alliance.\"\r\nCaptain Smith, of the \"Trepassy,\" was killed. The Captain of the\r\n\"Atalanta\" was brought on board and taken to Captain Barry, wounded in\r\nhis cabin. Captain Edwards advanced and presented his sword. Captain\r\nBarry received it but at once returned it, saying:\r\n\r\n\"I return it to you, Sir. You have merited it. Your King ought to give\r\nyou a better ship. Here is my cabin at your service. Use it as your\r\nown.\"\r\n\r\nHe then ordered Lieutenant King, of the \"Trepassy\" brig to be brought to\r\nhim. The crew of the \"Atalanta\" and the prisoners Barry had on the\r\n\"Alliance,\" numbering 250, should all be put on the \"Trepassy,\" her\r\ncannon thrown overboard, and she sent to Halifax as a cartel for the\r\nexchange of American prisoners, while the Captain and Lieutenant\r\nremained as hostages. The \"Atalanta\" was retaken by the \"Charlestown\"\r\nand \"Vulture.\" On account of Captain Barry's wound, the \"Alliance\" made\r\nall sail for Boston. Kessler relates that when Captain Barry had been\r\ncarried to his cabin to have his wounds dressed, the Lieutenant later\r\nwent to him and reporting that the \"Alliance\" was very much damaged,\r\nmany men killed and wounded and of the disadvantages for want of wind,\r\nasked \"Shall the colors be struck?\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Barry passionately answered: \"No, Sir, and if the ship cannot be\r\nfought without me, I will be brought on deck.\" The officer immediately\r\nreturned to deck. Captain Barry, after being dressed in haste, was on\r\nhis way to the deck when the enemy struck. The \"Alliance\" lost eleven\r\nkilled and twenty-four wounded. From her crew of two hundred and\r\neighty--three prize crews had been taken--fifty were on the sick list. A\r\nfew of these were able to sit between decks and hand powder to the\r\nmagazine. There were more than one hundred prisoners on board, as well\r\nas those of the crew of a mutinous disposition. Add to all this\r\ndisadvantage the total calm prevailing until near the end of the\r\ncontest, the capture of the two British vessels was one of special\r\nnoteworthy importance. \"It was considered a most brilliant exploit and\r\nan unequivocal evidence of the unconquerable firmness and intrepidity of\r\nthe victor,\" says Frost's _Naval Biography_. Here again we find Captain\r\nBarry adding to his record of capturing two prizes in one action.\r\n\r\nThe \"Alliance\" continued cruising, searching for other prey, but not\r\nmeeting any, made for Boston, where she arrived June 6, 1781. Captain\r\nBarry's wound was yet in a dangerous condition. So he sent Kessler to\r\nPhiladelphia to bring on Mrs. Barry. The \"Alliance\" being much shattered\r\nin her masts, sails and rigging, a thorough overhauling and repairing\r\nwas needed. The three mutineers were tried and condemned to be hanged.\r\nThe sentence was commuted to \"serve during the war.\" Captain Barry\r\nrefused their admission on the \"Alliance,\" so they were delivered to a\r\nrecruiting party as soldiers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n   JOHN PAUL JONES SEEKS TO BE \"HEAD OF THE NAVY\" IN PLACE OF\r\n   BARRY--BARRY TAKES LAFAYETTE TO FRANCE, AFTER THE SURRENDER OF\r\n   CORNWALLIS, ON \"BUSINESS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE\"--ORDERED TO TAKE\r\n   NO PRIZES--LANDS LAFAYETTE--RETURNS TO AMERICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn July 25, 1781, Captain Barry reported to the Board of Admiralty that\r\nhe was \"almost recovered\" of his wound and in a few days would be able\r\nfor duty, his presence being very requisite on account of the scarcity\r\nof officers. He made recommendations for places. On June 24th Captain\r\nJames Nicholson had written Captain Barry congratulating him upon his\r\nsuccess. He related in detail the endeavors of Captain John Paul Jones\r\nby personal application to members of Congress to have himself declared\r\n\"Head of the Navy.\" He told Barry that his \"arrival and success came\r\nopportunely and I did not fail to make use of it in presence of Captain\r\nJones and some of his advocate members by observing that you had\r\nacquitted yourself well, which they acknowledged. I then told them they\r\ncould not do less than make you an Admiral also. I had not a sentence in\r\nreply. It irritated Jones so much that he was obliged to decamp.\" This\r\nshows that among naval men Barry was then regarded as \"Head of the\r\nNavy\"--as he was in fact if not by title.\r\n\r\nIn 1781 the Admiralty and Navy Boards were abolished by Congress and all\r\nnaval affairs given to the Finance Department, supervised by Robert\r\nMorris. At this time the \"Alliance\" and the \"Deane,\" frigates,\r\nconstituted the whole of the effective navy. On September 21st Mr.\r\nMorris notified Captain Barry that it was projected to have the two\r\nfrigates sent out upon a cruise under Barry's command to \"disturb the\r\nenemy\" by taking prizes, and neither fixing the cruising ground nor its\r\nlength of time, knowing Barry would take \"the most likely course and be\r\nanxious to meet such events as will do honor to the American flag and\r\npromote the general interest.\" He was to transmit at every opportunity\r\nreports of his operations to Morris and to General Washington any\r\nintelligence which may affect his operations. But, late in October, the\r\n\"Deane\" not being manned as soon as the \"Alliance,\" Barry was directed\r\nto proceed to sea as soon as the \"Alliance\" would be ready. But the\r\nvictory at Yorktown on October 19th, when Cornwallis surrendered his\r\narmy to the combined French and American forces and to the French fleet,\r\ncaused a change to be made in the movements of the \"Alliance.\"\r\n\r\nInstead of going out to seek prizes to procure funds to be applied to\r\nthe support of the small navy, Captain Barry, on November 21, 1781, was\r\ndirected to take Lafayette to France \"on business of the utmost\r\nimportance to America.\" So urgent was this mission that Barry was\r\ndirected to take part of the crew of the \"Deane,\" place them on the\r\n\"Alliance\" and to take such French seamen as the Consul could procure.\r\nIf still short of men the Governor of Massachusetts should be applied to\r\nfor permission to impress seamen wherever found. Besides Lafayette, his\r\nbrother-in-law, Vicomte de Noailles, General Du Portail, Colonel\r\nGouvion, Major La Combe and others were also taken on the \"Alliance.\"\r\n\r\nMorris directed that \"the safe and speedy arrival of Marquis Lafayette\r\nis of such importance that I think it most consistent with my duty to\r\nrestrain you from cruising on the passage. You are, therefore, to avoid\r\nall vessels and keep in mind as your sole object to make a quiet and\r\nsafe passage to some port in France.\"\r\n\r\nRegarding stores for the accommodation of the French gentlemen, \"Let it\r\nbe done with discretion; remember we are not rich enough to be\r\nextravagant nor so poor as to act meanly.\" If funds were needed for a\r\nreturn cruise Barry was advised to \"prevail with the Marquis to give you\r\ncredit, but you must remember that all the money we have or can get in\r\nFrance will be wanted for other more important purpose, therefore, I\r\ncharge you not to expend one livre more than is absolutely necessary.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Alliance\" sailed from Boston on December 23, 1781, and arrived at\r\nL'Orient, on January 18, 1782. During the voyage a British ship appeared\r\nin sight, \"as if she could give them sport,\" as Barry's crew often\r\nwishing \"Lafayette was in France,\" stated it. Barry's peremptory order\r\nto avoid all vessels and take no prizes debarred an encounter with the\r\nenemy. The crew manifested discontent at avoiding the possible prizes\r\nand, relates Kessler, this appeared to increase the conflict in Barry's\r\nmind between the call of duty and his inclination. Instead of\r\nreprobating and promptly punishing what on other occasions would have\r\nbeen the case, he was governed by a sullen silence which, if propriety\r\npermitted him to break, would have pronounced: \"I also wish the Marquis\r\nwere in France.\" But duty triumphed then as ever with Barry. As\r\nspeedily as wind and wave and skill could force onward the \"Alliance\"\r\nshe sped on her mission of the \"utmost importance,\" and in twenty-three\r\ndays Lafayette was in France.\r\n\r\nBarry's instructions permitted him, after his placing Lafayette \"in\r\nFrance,\" to cruise in search of prizes until March 1st. The \"Alliance\"\r\nsailed from L'Orient on February 10, 1782, and returned after seventeen\r\ndays without making any captures, the vessels met being neutral ships.\r\n\r\nOn March 16, 1782, the \"Alliance\" sailed from L'Orient for return to\r\nAmerica and here again disappointment came. All the vessels spoken on\r\nthe voyage \"none were of the enemy.\" On May 10th the \"Alliance\" arrived\r\noff the Delaware Bay. The British frigate \"Chatham,\" of 64 guns, and the\r\n\"Speedwell,\" sloop-of-war, barred entrance to the river, and off New\r\nYork two more frigates joined in the chase of the \"Alliance,\" but she,\r\nhaving a speed of fifteen knots an hour, succeeded in escaping the much\r\nsuperior force and getting to New London, Connecticut, on May 13th. This\r\nincident was one of traditionary interest among the veterans of the old\r\ntime wooden navy.\r\n\r\n\"Not a prize this trip! Hard luck indeed,\" wrote Barry to John Brown,\r\nSecretary of the Board of Admiralty, to whom also he wrote that Robert\r\nMorris had sent him orders to join the French frigates at Rhode Island\r\nand be under their command. \"Mr. Morris,\" wrote Barry, \"must be\r\nunacquainted with his rank or he must think me a droll kind of a fellow\r\nto be commanded by a midshipman. I assure you I don't feel myself so low\r\na commander as to brook such orders. I suppose he will be much offended.\r\nI assure you although I serve the country for nothing I am determined no\r\nmidshipman shall command me, let him be a chevalier or what he will.\"\r\n\r\nBarry wrote from New London to Mr. Brown: \"I never was in such a damn\r\ncountry in my life. You never was in so miserable a place in your life.\r\nAll the people here live five miles from home. Not a house have I been\r\nin but the tavern and one Irishman's.\" The tavern was kept by Thomas\r\nAllen, an Irishman from the island of Antigua, whose \"antipathy to the\r\nBritish was abnormal\"--and so we may well believe he was a kindred\r\nspirit to that of Commodore Barry.\r\n\r\nThough Captain Barry thought he had \"hard luck\" in not taking a prize,\r\nyet the log-book of the \"Alliance,\" a copy of which he sent the\r\nCommittee of Investigation, relates that on April 3d he fell in with two\r\nprivateers, gave each of them a broadside, one of them struck, the other\r\nran; hove out a signal for the \"Marquis La Fayette\" to take charge of\r\nthe privateer that had struck while the \"Alliance\" went in chase of the\r\nother, \"which we shortly after took.\" The record again shows Captain\r\nBarry did as he usually had done--captured two vessels in a battle.\r\n\r\nThough he brought in no prize he yet was not unmindful of Mrs. Barry,\r\nbut brought her a carpet and \"a wash kettle full of claret,\" and\r\ndoubtless other luxuries of the time as well as advising her \"not to\r\nstay so much at home,\" as it \"was clever to visit one's friends now and\r\nthen, besides it is helpful to good health,\" added the gallant Captain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n   A MOST SUCCESSFUL CRUISE--NINE PRIZES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"Alliance\" while at New London was fitted out for a cruise on which\r\nshe started August 4, 1782, at four o'clock in the morning. Barry had a\r\nfew days before an interview with General Washington. By seven o'clock\r\nBarry had captured from the enemy a brig laden with lumber and fish\r\nwhich \"had been cut out of Rhode Island by the enemy.\" The cruise was\r\nfirst to the Bermudas and then to the Banks of New Foundland.\r\n\r\nOn August 9th Barry took the schooner \"Polly\" bound from Bermuda to\r\nHalifax with a cargo of molasses, sugar and lime and sent her to Boston.\r\nOn August 19th arrived at the Bermudas after chasing several vessels,\r\namong which was the \"Experiment,\" of 18 guns, which escaped into St.\r\nGeorge's Harbor. On the 23d Barry sent Captain Tufts, of the \"Polly,\" to\r\ninform the Governor that unless all the American prisoners were released\r\nhe would remain for three weeks and hinder vessels going in or coming\r\nout which, said Barry, he \"could effectively do as their whole force was\r\nnot sufficient to cope with the 'Alliance.'\" On August 25th Barry chased\r\nthe privateer \"Hawk\" and took from her the sloop \"Fortune,\" which she\r\nhad captured. The \"Hawk\" escaped.\r\n\r\nThe \"Alliance\" continued cruising and chasing vessels until August 30th,\r\nwhen learning from a brig from Guadeloupe bound for Rhode Island, that a\r\nlarge fleet had sailed from Jamaica, Captain Barry concluded to attempt\r\nto overhaul by running northeast. On September 8th he captured a\r\nNantucket brig returning from a whaling cruise. It had protection papers\r\nfrom Admiral Digby and permission to bring the oil to New York, then in\r\nBritish possession as during almost all the war. At this time the\r\n\"Alliance\" was off the Banks of New Foundland, where on September 18th\r\nthe capture of a brig, one of the Jamaica fleet, was made. Barry learned\r\nthat the convoy--the \"Ramilie,\" of 74 guns--had foundered in a gale and\r\nthat the fleet he was in search of had scattered.\r\n\r\nOn September 24th Barry took two ships--on 27th he captured another. On\r\nthe following day he captured a dismantled ship and all of the fleet\r\nfrom Jamaica he had been in search of and ordered them to L'Orient,\r\nFrance, where the \"Alliance\" with the prizes arrived October 17th, and\r\nthe prisoners, except those who had entered into American service, were\r\nsent on shore. Most of the prisoners belonged at Glasgow where they had\r\nfamilies. Otherwise these also would have entered under Captain Barry.\r\n\"The separation,\" records Kessler, \"was more like the separation of old\r\nfriends than that of individuals of nations at war.\" Their treatment on\r\nthe \"Alliance\" while prisoners was good. The officers were given\r\nquarters with officers--the privates placed with the privates of the\r\n\"Alliance,\" enjoying fare alike. No confinement, no abridgment of food\r\nnor any labor required of them.\r\n\r\nSeveral officers of the \"Ramilie\" were captives. The treatment they\r\nreceived from Captain Barry was so different from the usual treatment of\r\nAmerican officers by the British commanders, it \"made them blush for\r\ntheir country,\" notes Kessler, the Master's Mate. The captures numbered\r\nthree ships, one snow, two brigs, one schooner and one sloop, all\r\nmerchant vessels, variously loaded--nine prizes. Four other prizes were\r\nbrought by the \"Alliance\" to L'Orient and four sent to America. They\r\nwere sold at auction.\r\n\r\nThe shares of the United States as shown by Robert Morris' accounts\r\nwere:\r\n\r\nThe \"Kingston,\" 75,834.11.3 livres or $14,083.39\r\n\r\nThe \"Commerce,\" 104,263.12.5 livres or $19,308.08.\r\n\r\nThe \"Britannia,\" 43,620.18.5 livres or $8,077.85.\r\n\r\nThe \"Anna,\" 71,656.11.5 livres or $13,269.60.\r\n\r\nThe prizes were loaded with rum, sugar, coffee and liquors. One-half the\r\nproceeds went to the Government--the other part to the captors. A\r\nCaptain was entitled to six shares. Captain Barry's report of the\r\ncruise, dated October 18, 1782, reads: \"A few hours after I sailed from\r\nNew London I retook a brigantine and sent her in there; proceeded as\r\nfast as possible off Bermudas; on my way I took a schooner from that\r\nplace for Halifax; after cruising off there for twelve or fifteen days I\r\nretook a sloop from New London and sent her to Cape Francois. Finding\r\nthe prizes I had taken of little value either to myself or the country\r\nand in all likelihood should be obliged to return into port soon for\r\nwant of men, was determined to alter my cruising ground. I, therefore,\r\nthought it best to run off the Banks of New Foundland. On my way thither\r\nI fell in with a whaling brigantine with a pass from Admiral Digby; I\r\nmanned her and sent her to Boston. A few days after, off the Banks of\r\nNew Foundland, I took a brigantine from Jamaica bound to London loaded\r\nwith sugar and rum and sent her for Boston; by this vessel I found the\r\nJamaica fleet was to the eastward of us. I then carried a press of sail\r\nfor four days. The fifth day I took two ships that had parted with the\r\nfleet. After manning them, and a fresh gale westwardly, I thought best\r\nto order them to France. A day or two after I took a snow and a ship\r\nbelonging to the same fleet.\r\n\r\n\"Being short of water, and a number of prisoners on board, the\r\nwestwardly winds still blowing fresh and the expectation of falling in\r\nwith some more of them, I thought it best to proceed to France, with a\r\ndetermined view to get those I had already taken in safe and after\r\nlanding the prisoners to put out immediately; but meeting with blowing\r\nweather and high sea, I lost the sails of the head and was in great\r\ndanger of losing the head, which accident obliged me to put in here,\r\nwhere I arrived yesterday with the four prizes. After repairing the\r\ndamages and getting what the ships may want I shall put to sea on a\r\ncruise.\"\r\n\r\nWhile at L'Orient, Captain Barry was invited by Lafayette to come to\r\nParis, but as he had been \"indisposed with a fever which confined him\r\nfor ten days\" and the ship ready to sail, he could not accept, but wrote\r\nthe Marquis he envied the Captain who was to take him to America, but as\r\nthat pleasure could not be his, Barry hoped to command the ship that\r\nwould convey Lafayette back to France, when he would visit Paris and\r\n\"have the honor of seeing Lady Fayette,\" an honor his brother who since\r\nwas lost at sea had had.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n   OFFICERS OF THE \"ALLIANCE\" REFUSE TO SERVE--PEACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough in October Captain Barry hoped in a few days to proceed on a\r\ncruise it was not until December 8, 1782, that he was ready to sail,\r\nwhich he did the next day. Lieutenants Patrick Fletcher and Nicholas\r\nGardner, John Buckley, Master; James Geagan, Surgeon, and Samuel Cooper,\r\nPurser, demanded two-thirds of their wages, \"though they had received as\r\nmuch prize-money as they knew what to do with.\" Captain Barry informed\r\nthem that he had no authority to pay them and had no money if he had.\r\nThey refused to go on board the \"Alliance\" and do their duty.\r\nAccordingly, Captain Barry placed them under arrest until tried by\r\nCourt-Martial in the United States. He was obliged to appoint others,\r\n\"not adequate to the duty of the stations, 'but necessity knows no\r\nlaw,'\" he wrote Thomas Barclay, Consul-General of the United States and\r\nCommissioner of the Navy in France, who justified Barry's course and\r\nconcurred in the appointments he made.\r\n\r\nAll this time there were rumors of peace. On November 30, 1782,\r\npreliminary articles of peace had been signed. On December 5th King\r\nGeorge III announced that he had given the \"necessary orders to prohibit\r\nthe further prosecution of offensive war upon the Continent of North\r\nAmerica.\"\r\n\r\nThough Captain Barry, early in December, 1782, had \"great reason to\r\nthink peace was concluded,\" he decided to make another cruise by\r\n\"running down the coast of Guinea\" and returning to America by way of\r\nMartinico, believing \"should peace be made there will be a certain time\r\ngiven for vessels to make prizes in certain latitudes.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Alliance\" sailed from L'Orient on December 9th, but though chasing\r\nseveral vessels, no encounter came about. On December 16th arrived at\r\nPorto Sancto--the next day the island of Madeira. Sailed hence and on\r\nJanuary 8, 1783, arrived off Martinico. At St. Pierre Harbor Barry found\r\norders for him to proceed to Havana to take in specie for Congress.\r\n\r\nOn January 12th sailed for Havana and after stopping at St. Eustatia and\r\nCape Francois arrived there January 17th. While off Hispaniola Barry met\r\nan English fleet of seventeen sail, but he \"got clear of them.\" The\r\nnext day met two British cruisers, one of 74 guns. They chased the\r\n\"Alliance\" under the guns of Cape Francois.\r\n\r\nOn February 13th Captain Barry notified the Governor of Havana that the\r\n\"Alliance\" and \"Duc de Lauzun,\" frigates belonging to Congress, were\r\nready to sail from that port. He requested permission for the frigates\r\nto depart as he had \"despatches from the Court of France which are very\r\nimportant,\" and also desired that the American merchant vessels at the\r\nport should be permitted to depart under convoy of the \"Alliance.\" The\r\nGovernor replied that, complying with secret instructions from the King,\r\nit was entirely out of his power to grant the permission sought. To\r\nwhich Barry replied that it was somewhat singular for ships of war\r\nemployed on national objects to be restricted in the same manner as\r\nmerchant vessels. He then again asked \"in the name of my Sovereign for\r\npermission for the sailing of the two American ships of war.\" He\r\nwithdrew his request for the trading vessels as they were \"fully under\r\nthe influence of the embargo.\" The Governor replied that he and the\r\nAdmiral of the Squadron had consulted and decided that permission could\r\nnot be given then. He advised Captain Barry \"to reflect on the immense\r\nprejudice that might occur to the common cause of the allied powers and\r\ncommerce of Spain if any unlucky accident should happen by the enemy\r\ntaking one of the frigates.\"\r\n\r\nOn February 22d, Washington's birthday, Captain Barry issued orders \"to\r\nexercise the great guns and the small arms every day, to loose the\r\ntopsails in order the men could learn to do it well, to have wood and\r\nwater ready for sea.\" He evidently was having the ship ready for service\r\nand action though he had brought the news of peace to the West India\r\nIslands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n   THE LAST BATTLE OF THE REVOLUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Barry's foresight in having everything ready for war, although\r\nthe preliminary articles of peace had been signed, was soon manifested.\r\nThe \"Alliance\" left Havana on March 6, 1783, in company with the \"Duc de\r\nLauzun,\" commanded by Captain Greene. There also sailed nine Spanish\r\nwarships. Not knowing where the Spaniards were bound to, Captain Barry\r\ndecided to make his own way and ordered Captain Greene to follow him.\r\n\r\nThe \"Alliance\" and \"Lauzun\" had seventy-two thousand dollars \"of public\r\nmoney on board,\" which Captain Barry had been entrusted with to deliver,\r\nby order of Robert Morris, Superintendent of Finance, to George Olney,\r\nof Providence, R.I., in case he arrived in that harbor. The afternoon\r\nafter leaving Havana two British cruisers were seen. Captains Barry and\r\nGreene \"stood for the Spanish fleet,\" of which some vessels had been\r\nseen in the morning. He did this as \"the only way to save the 'Lauzun,'\"\r\nas that vessel sailed \"much heavier\" than the \"Alliance.\" At ten o'clock\r\nat night they got in sight of part of the Spanish fleet. The British\r\nmen-of-war had followed closely and had got within gun-shot of the\r\n\"Alliance\" and \"Lauzun\" when, observing the lights of the Spaniards,\r\nthey abandoned the chase. Barry and Greene kept in company with the\r\nSpaniards all night--though they found in the morning that they were but\r\neight or ten sloops and schooners. \"However, they answered our ends,\"\r\nreported Captain Barry.\r\n\r\nThe British not being in sight and no tidings of them among the\r\nSpaniards, the Americans \"made the best of their way.\" Finding the\r\n\"Lauzun\" much slower than the \"Alliance,\" the public money on board of\r\nher was transferred to the \"Alliance.\" On the morning of the 9th \"three\r\nlarge sail of ships,\" British men-of-war, were seen \"standing directly\r\nfor us,\" reported Barry. He signaled Greene to follow him, who replied\r\nthe enemy were of superior force. The \"Alliance\" having the money, Barry\r\nbelieving he could be of no service to the \"Lauzun,\" made all sail and\r\nran faster than the British could follow. But Barry shortened sail and\r\nspoke the \"Lauzun.\" By this time one of the British, a 32-gun frigate,\r\nwas within gun-shot of the \"Alliance\" and the \"Lauzun\"--the other two\r\nBritish cruisers a little way astern and fast coming up to the\r\n\"Lauzun.\" Captain Greene told Captain Barry the two were privateers, but\r\nBarry \"told him he was mistaken\" and that he knew better.\r\n\r\nWhile the \"Alliance\" dropped astern, the foremost British frigate\r\nshortened sail and would not come near the \"Alliance.\"\r\n\r\nLater the two British came up fast. Captain Barry, \"confident within\"\r\nhimself that the \"Alliance\" \"would have fallen a sacrifice\" if he\r\nremained with the \"Lauzun,\" signaled Captain Greene to heave his guns\r\noverboard so as to get clear of the enemy by lightening his ship. By\r\nthis time one of the British was within gun-shot of the \"Lauzun.\" They\r\nfired several shots at one another but at too great a distance for\r\neither to do damage. In the morning a strange ship had been seen to the\r\nsouthward, but sailing away from the \"Alliance.\" In the afternoon after\r\nthe \"Lauzun\" had exchanged shots with the enemy pursuing her, this\r\n\"strange sail\" stood for the Americans. Barry had \"all the reason in the\r\nworld to suppose she was a stranger to the enemy also,\" as at that time\r\nthe \"Lauzun\" was firing \"stern chasers\" at her pursuer. Barry then ran\r\ndown between the \"Lauzun\" and the enemy in order to give Captain Greene\r\na chance to get off by bringing the enemy into action, which Barry did\r\n\"close on board for forty-five minutes, when the enemy sheered off.\"\r\nDuring the action the \"Alliance\" had ten wounded--one dying later. The\r\n\"spars and rigging were hurt a little but not so much but they would all\r\ndo again.\" Captains Barry and Greene then sailed towards the strange\r\nship. It proved to be a French gun ship of 60 guns, which had sailed\r\nfrom Havana two days before Barry and Greene. It had half a million\r\ndollars on board and was bound to one of the French islands.\r\n\r\nKessler relates that Captain Barry expected the French gunship to assist\r\nthe \"Alliance\"; that two of the British kept \"at a distance as if\r\nwaiting to ascertain about the French ship.\" But though she \"approached\r\nthe Americans fast,\" she did not join in the encounter. When Captain\r\nBarry afterwards \"asked them why they did not come down during the\r\naction, they answered they thought they might have been taken, and the\r\nsignal known; that the action was only 'a sham to decoy him.'\"\r\n\r\n\"His foolish action,\" records Kessler, \"thus, perhaps, lost us the three\r\nfrigates, for Captain Barry commenced the action in the full expectation\r\nof the French ship joining and thereby not only be able to cope but to\r\nsubdue part, if not the whole of them.\"\r\n\r\nThe French proposed to give chase. This was done, but the French ship\r\ncould not keep up with the \"Alliance\" or the slower \"Lauzun.\" This\r\nbattle took place on March 10, 1783. The British frigate was the\r\n\"Sybille,\" commanded by Captain Vashon, which, on January 22, 1783, had\r\nbeen captured from the French by the British \"Hussar,\" commanded by\r\nCaptain Thomas Macnamara Russell. Captain Vashon \"confessed he had never\r\nseen a ship so ably fought as the 'Alliance,' that he had never received\r\nsuch a drubbing and was indebted to his consorts for his escape from\r\ncapture.\" He always spoke of Captain Barry in the most magnanimous\r\nterms.\r\n\r\n\"The coolness and intrepidity no less than the skill and fertility in\r\nexpedients which Captain Barry displayed on this occasion are described\r\nin naval annals as truly wonderful; every quality of a great commander\r\nwas brought out with extraordinary brilliancy.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the occasion on which Captain Barry is said to have replied to\r\nthe hail of the British that his was \"The United States ship 'Alliance,'\r\nSaucy Jack Barry, half Irishman, half Yankee! Who are you?\"\r\n\r\nI do not believe this true. It is too bombastic to suit the character of\r\nCaptain Barry. He could not have called himself \"Saucy,\" for nothing of\r\nimpetuosity or dare-devilishness was ever manifested in his career. Nor\r\ndid he ever flippantly call himself \"Jack.\"\r\n\r\n\"My name is John Barry,\" was his dignified declaration to Lieutenant\r\nGregory, as we have seen. It embodied respect and determination and\r\ndignity of character which he ever maintained.\r\n\r\nLet not his admirers lessen that dignity.\r\n\r\nThis--the last battle of the Revolution--occurred March 10, 1783, after\r\nthe signing of the Provisional Articles of Peace at Paris, November 30,\r\n1782; after the Preliminary Articles for Restoring Peace, signed at\r\nVersailles on January 20, 1783, and also after the Ratification of the\r\nPreliminary Articles on February 3, 1783, by the Ministers of the United\r\nStates, France and Great Britain, by which a cessation of hostilities\r\nwas agreed upon.\r\n\r\nOn April 11, 1783, Congress, by Proclamation, ordered the \"cessation of\r\narms as well by sea as by land.\" But, one month prior, Captain John\r\nBarry had the final encounter on the ocean in defense of the Liberty and\r\nIndependence of the United States. He had thus commanded the first\r\nContinental cruiser, the \"Lexington\" and also commanded the last\r\nContinental frigate, the \"Alliance\"; bringing to Congress the first\r\nprize brought to Philadelphia and defending and saving the last\r\nContinental war money brought to the country on the last armed vessel of\r\nthe new Nation. He commanded the \"Lexington,\" the first vessel\r\ncommissioned by authority of the Continental Congress. He commanded the\r\n\"Alliance,\" the best vessel the Congress had commissioned and the last\r\nin the Continental service. He brought Congress its first prize. He\r\nbrought Congress its last war money.\r\n\r\nOn March 20, 1783, the \"Alliance\" arrived at Newport, R.I.--the last war\r\nday, as on the next day the \"Triumphe,\" commanded by Chevalier du\r\nQuesne, arrived at Philadelphia with the preliminary Treaty of Peace.\r\nShe had been despatched from Cadiz on February 11th by D'Estaing, who\r\nwas ready to sail with sixty ships of the line and a very formidable\r\narmament, but had given up the voyage on the agreement for peace.\r\n\r\nOn March 25th--Annunciation Day--Congress ordered the recall of all\r\nvessels cruising under authority of the United States.\r\n\r\nOn April 19, 1783, Washington announced the close of the war and the\r\ndisbandment of the army.\r\n\r\nOn April 16th the cessation of hostilities was proclaimed in Barry's\r\nhome city--Philadelphia--to \"a vast concourse of people, who expressed\r\ntheir satisfaction on the happy occasion by repeated shouts. The State\r\nflag was hoisted and the bells were rung and a general joy diffused\r\nitself throughout the city.\"\r\n\r\nNew York City had been under British control nearly the whole war. How\r\ngreat the contrast there. \"When the proclamation was read nothing but\r\ngroans and hisses prevailed, attended by bitter reproaches and curses on\r\ntheir King for having deserted them in the midst of their calamities.\"\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, the seat of the \"Rebellion,\" now by success made a\r\n\"Revolution,\" was open to the commerce of the world. On May 2d the ship\r\n\"Hibernia,\" Robert Scallan, Master, arrived from Dublin and soon, at the\r\nstore of Clement Biddle his cargo of \"gold and silver silks, rich and\r\nslight brocades, flannels, Mantuas and fabrics, colored and sky colored\r\ntissue and Florentines, tamboured silks and satin, shapes for\r\ngentlemen's vests and black Norwich capes\" were on sale.\r\n\r\nJoy bounded throughout the land. Meetings were held to express patriotic\r\nsentiments. The men of Northampton, Pa., did so. The ladies of\r\nNorthampton followed the next day. Among the \"toasts\" on the occasion\r\nwas this: \"May the Protestant religion prevail and flourish through all\r\nnations.\"\r\n\r\nYet John Barry, an Irish-born Roman Catholic, had battled all the eight\r\nyears--from the first to the last of the fight--to win Freedom and\r\nIndependence for the land in which these Ladies of Northampton \"hoped\r\nthe Protestant religion might prevail.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FRIGATE \"UNITED STATES\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n   BARRY VISITS THE \"SYBILLE\" ON HIS RETURN TO PHILADELPHIA--PEACE IS\r\n   DECLARED--ORDERED TO AMSTERDAM WITH TOBACCO--THE \"ALLIANCE\" BECOMES\r\n   DISABLED--IS ORDERED SOLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Captain Barry had arrived at New London it was nearly three months\r\nbefore he came on to Philadelphia. Mrs. Barry had, in April, gone on to\r\nNew London. Captain Barry returned home by way of New York. The\r\n\"Sybille\" was there. Captain Barry visited her and was \"politely\r\ntreated\" by Captain Vashon. The vessel yet bore the marks of the injury\r\nBarry had inflicted and \"they said they had not been treated so roughly\r\nbefore,\" records Kessler. Some of the Hessians were embarked on her for\r\nreturn home. As she had received \"eighteen cannon shots her condition\r\nwas such that pumps had to be manned night and day to keep her from\r\nfilling five to eight feet of water.\" That proved how she had been\r\nshattered by Barry. Captain Barry, after a brief visit to Philadelphia,\r\nreturned to Providence Harbor and soon set sail for the Rappahannock\r\nRiver, Virginia, for a cargo of tobacco for Amsterdam, Holland, on\r\npublic account, to pay the interest on loan negotiated there. This was\r\nin August, 1783.\r\n\r\nOn the way down the Providence River the \"Alliance,\" when going four or\r\nfive miles an hour, ran against a sunken rock, which \"stopped her as\r\nquick as thought,\" related Barry. After remaining on the rock two hours\r\nand finding the ship made no water in consequence of the mishap, the\r\n\"Alliance\" proceeded to Virginia where she took on 500 hogsheads of\r\ntobacco weighing 530,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe Accounts of Robert Morris show that to meet this Holland Loan, 1837\r\nhogsheads of tobacco weighing 1,937,355 pounds had been sent by Daniel\r\nClarke, Agent of the Finance Department.\r\n\r\nOn August 24th the \"Alliance\" sailed from the Capes of Virginia \"with\r\ngood prospects before us and in hopes of a short voyage. But,\" as\r\nCaptain Barry reported to Robert Morris on the 26th from the Delaware\r\nBay, \"as is often the case when people's expectations are buoyed up with\r\ngreat prospects they frequently find themselves disappointed.\"\r\n\r\n\"We had not been long out with a moderate breeze, wind and smooth sea\r\nwhen we discovered all of a sudden the ship to make nineteen inches per\r\nhour and soon to have three feet of water in her hold and so damaging\r\nthe tobacco.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Barry then \"made for the Delaware.\" Though her bottom was\r\n\"perfectly sound when bore down at Providence,\" Barry believed the run\r\non the rock caused the leak. The damage to the \"Alliance\" was serious\r\nenough to warrant Congress appointing a committee to examine the\r\ncondition of the ship. On September on their report Congress ordered the\r\nship \"to be unladen and her cargo freighted to Europe on the best\r\nterms.\" The Agent of Marine was directed to discharge officers and crew,\r\nhave her surveyed and a report made of the expense \"necessary to give\r\nher a good repair.\" Five hundred hogsheads of the tobacco were reshipped\r\non the \"Princess Ulrico\" [480 hhds.] and the \"Four Friends\" [20 hhds.].\r\n\r\nHad the voyage to Amsterdam been made, Barry would have stopped at\r\nLondon. Robert Morris gave him a (July 24, 1783) letter of introduction\r\nto Messrs. Bewickes & Mourgue of that city stating that: \"He has proved\r\nhimself a brave and deserving officer in the service of his country and\r\na worthy man in every station of life.\" (Crimmin's Autographs.) He also\r\nhad a letter from John Paul Jones to friends in Paris.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the Act, Robert Morris, Agent of Marine, appointed as\r\nsurveyors Captains John Barry and Thomas Read and Messrs. Thomas\r\nPenrose, Joshua Humphreys, Jr., and Benjamin G. Eyre. The latter were\r\nshipbuilders. They estimated the repairs would cost 5866-2/3\r\ndollars--that it was not necessary to keep the \"Alliance\" for the\r\nprotection of commerce and it would be to the interest of the Union to\r\ndispose of her. A resolution to direct the Agent of Marine to dispose of\r\nher by public auction was adopted on June 3, 1785. She was sold on\r\nAugust 1, 1785. So Congress parted with its last and its best vessel.\r\nThe new Nation was without a ship or flag on the ocean. Captain Barry\r\nhad the first Continental vessel. He commanded the last one. Great must\r\nhave been his satisfaction when given the \"Lexington.\" Sad, indeed, must\r\nhe have been in parting with the \"Alliance.\"\r\n\r\nShe was purchased by Coburn & Whitehead for L2287 or $7,700 in\r\ncertificates of public credit. They sold to Robert Morris \"at a great\r\nprofit.\" She became a merchant vessel and in June, 1787, made a voyage\r\nto China, returning September, 1788. She was of 724 tons--a large ship\r\nfor those days. After all her perilous voyages and wonderful escapes\r\nfrom the enemy she was beached on Petty's Island in the Delaware River\r\nopposite Kensington, Philadelphia. Part of her timbers remained until\r\n1901 and her hulk was visible at low tide. The widening of the channel\r\ncaused the removal of what remained of her hulk.

We find him recommending subordinate officers for\r\npositions in the merchant service, in petitioning Congress that officers\r\nof the Navy be put on \"a footing similar to their brother officers of\r\nthe land service, as to half-pay or commutation and lands according to\r\ntheir ranks, as they were the only class of officers who remain\r\nneglected and totally unprovided for.\" He referred evidently to his own\r\nexperience when he said, \"few of the ships belonging to the United\r\nStates were ever suffered to cruise, but were sent on private service\r\nand ordered not to go out of their way, but to keep clear of all vessels\r\nwhatever and that such as were permitted had particular cruising grounds\r\npointed out to them, which frequently ensured them severe blows and but\r\nfew prizes.\"\r\n\r\nWhen in 1787 a Federal convention had been held in Philadelphia to\r\nformulate a Constitution by which the States could form \"a more perfect\r\nunion\" and \"promote domestic tranquility,\" the present Constitution of\r\nour country was formulated by the convention for ratification by the\r\nseveral States. In each State controversy and discussion arose over the\r\nconsideration of the advisability of adopting it as the supreme law of\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\nThe Confederation had proven unsuited to the needs of the country. So a\r\nnew plan of government was necessary. On September 17th, the day the\r\nConvention had adopted the Constitution, the Pennsylvania members of the\r\nConvention at once notified the Assembly of the State, then in session\r\nat the Hall of Independence, that they were ready to report to the\r\nAssembly. The next morning \"the honorable delegates, led by Benjamin\r\nFranklin, were ushered into the Hall of the Assembly, made their report\r\nand presented the new Constitution.\" No action was taken by the\r\nAssembly. On September 29th, the last day but one of the session, George\r\nClymer proposed to refer the Act of Ratification to a Convention of the\r\nState. Pleas for delay were made. Thomas FitzSimons, a Catholic, one of\r\nthe Representatives at the Constitutional Convention and also a member\r\nof the Pennsylvania Assembly, opposed delay in submitting the new\r\nConstitution to a convention of the citizens for adoption or rejection.\r\n\r\nIt was resolved to call a State Convention, but no day was fixed for its\r\nmeeting. Nineteen members had voted against calling it. On their behalf\r\nit was asked that the consideration of the time of the meeting of the\r\nconvention should be postponed until the afternoon. This was granted.\r\nWhen the House again met, the nineteen were absent. The Assembly lacked\r\na quorum. The absentees were sent for, but refused to appear. Mr.\r\nWynkoop declared: \"If there is no way of compelling those who deserted\r\nfrom duty to perform it, then God be merciful to us!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a way of \"compelling\" and Captain John Barry led the\r\ncompellers.\r\n\r\nThe next morning a number of citizens, whose leader was Commodore John\r\nBarry, forcibly entered the lodgings of James McCalmont and Jacob Miley,\r\nthe members from Franklin and Dauphin Counties, dragged them to the\r\nState House and thrust them into the chamber where the Assembly was in\r\nsession without a quorum. With these two there were forty-six\r\nrepresentatives present--a quorum. Mr. McCalmont informed the House that\r\nhe had been forcibly brought into the Assembly-room, contrary to his\r\nwishes, by a number of citizens. He begged he might be allowed to\r\nretire.\r\n\r\nThomas FitzSimons replied that if any member of the House had forced the\r\ngentleman from the determination to absent himself, such member's\r\nconduct met the disapprobation of the House. But Mr. McCalmont was now\r\nhere and the business of the State cannot be accomplished if any one is\r\nsuffered to withdraw.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. McCalmont attempted to leave he was restrained by the citizens\r\nwho had \"dragged\" him into the Assembly. The House resumed the fixing a\r\ntime for the Convention to act on the Constitution. The date was fixed.\r\nThe people cheered. Christ Church chimes rang and Captain Barry, we may\r\nbe sure, was happy. By his action within twenty-three hours of the\r\nadoption of the Constitution by the Federal Convention, Pennsylvania had\r\nordered a State Convention to consider it. Verses relative to the\r\n\"dragging\" were soon published. One extract recited:\r\n\r\n   \"It seems to me I yet see Barry\r\n   Drag out McCalmont.\"\r\n\r\nBut McCalmont undertook the \"dragging\" of Barry into Court. On October\r\n13, 1787, he applied to the Supreme Executive Council and the Council\r\ndirected the Attorney-General to commence a prosecution against \"Captain\r\nJohn Barry and such other persons as shall be found to have been\r\nprincipally active in seizing James McCalmont or otherwise concerned in\r\nthe riotous proceedings.\" Ben Franklin, President, was one of the eight\r\nwho voted for the resolution. The Attorney-General began suit but at the\r\nCouncil meeting, February 16, 1788, he requested the advice of the\r\nCouncil \"relative to the suit carried on by their order against Captain\r\nJohn Barry.\" The Council informed him it did not wish to interfere, but\r\nleft the matter with him to do as he judged best.\r\n\r\nSo nothing more was done about the suit. By this time Captain Barry was\r\non the high seas on his way to China in the merchant ship \"Asia,\" in\r\nwhich he had sailed on January 7, 1787. It returned to Philadelphia,\r\nJune 4, 1789. So Captain Barry had been away over two years. Eight years\r\nafterwards, on July 7, 1797, the \"Asia,\" commanded by Captain Yard, when\r\nreturning from Bengal, was captured in sight of Cape May, New Jersey, by\r\nthe Spanish privateer \"Julia,\" commanded by Don Baptista Mahon, a name\r\nindicating Irish descent. She was valued at $800,000. But the next month\r\nshe was recaptured by an American privateer off Havana.\r\n\r\nColumbia claims her soldier love and Ireland joys to own\r\nThe boy who sailed from his Wexford home undaunted if unknown;\r\nColumbia guards his latest sleep--hers was his manhood's noon.\r\nIreland's the vigorous cradling arms and tender cradle croon;\r\nFor Ireland paints the dreaming boy on the lonely Wexford shore,\r\nIn 'customed clasp may meet the hands of mother and foster-mother\r\nAbove his grave, who was loyal to each as each unto the other.\r\n\r\n--_Margaret M.

The Algerines\r\nwere committing depredations on American commerce. Hence a naval force\r\nwas necessary. When Congress assembled in December, 1793, the building\r\nof frigates early engaged attention, not only to protect commerce from\r\nthe ravages of the Algerines but from the aggressions of France as well\r\nas from the violation of our neutrality by England.\r\n\r\nThe United States was without a ship.\r\n\r\nCaptain John Barry was prompt to offer his services to his country.\r\n\r\nOn March 19, 1794, he wrote President Washington:\r\n\r\n   \"_Sir_:--Finding that the Government have partly determined to fit\r\n   out some ships of war for the protection of our trade against the\r\n   Algerines, I beg leave to offer myself for the command of the\r\n   squadron, conceiving myself to be competent, thereto assuring your\r\n   Excellency that should I be honored with your approbation, my utmost\r\n   abilities and most unremitting attention should be exerted for the\r\n   good of my country and also to approve myself worthy of the high\r\n   honor shown by your Excellency.\r\n\r\n               \"To your Obedient, Humble Servant,\r\n\"March 19, 1794.\r\n    \"HIS EXCELLENCY.            [Signature: John Barry]\"\r\n\r\nA week later, March 27, 1794, Washington signed an Act declaring that\r\n\"the depredations of the Algerine Corsairs on the commerce of the United\r\nStates rendered it necessary that a naval force should be provided for\r\nits protection.\"\r\n\r\nThis Act is the foundation of our present Navy.\r\n\r\nCongress ordered the building and equipment of three frigates of\r\nforty-four guns and three of lesser weight and tonnage.\r\n\r\nOn June 5, 1794, public announcement was made of the appointment of six\r\nCaptains to superintend the construction and to take command of the\r\nvessels thus ordered. The notice sent to Captain Barry read:\r\n\r\n\"WAR DEPARTMENT, June 5, 1794.\r\n\r\n\"_Sir_:--The President of the United States, by and with the advice and\r\nconsent of the Senate, has appointed you to be a Captain of one of the\r\nships provided, in pursuance of the Act to provide a naval armament,\r\nherein enclosed.\r\n\r\n\"It is understood that the relative rank of the Captains is to be in the\r\nfollowing order:\r\n\r\n   John Barry,\r\n   Samuel Nicholson,\r\n   Silas Talbot,\r\n   Joshua Barney,\r\n   Richard Dale,\r\n   Thomas Truxtun.\r\n\r\nYou will please to inform me as soon as convenient whether you accept or\r\ndecline the appointment.\r\n\r\n\"I am, Sir, etc.,\r\n\r\n\r\n\"To                \"HENRY KNOX,\r\nCAPTAIN BARRY.\"           _Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\nCaptain Barry at once accepted, saying:\r\n\r\n\"STRAWBERRY HILL, June 6, 1794.\r\n\r\n\"The honor done me in appointing me Commander in the Navy of the United\r\nStates is gratefully acknowledged and accepted by,\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n Your Most Obedient,\r\n         Humble Servant,\r\n         [Signature: John Barry]\r\n\r\nThe original is in the Force Collection in the Lenox Branch of the New\r\nYork Public Library.\r\n\r\nThe commission was not signed nor issued by Washington until February\r\n22, 1797, when the frigate the \"United States,\" built under the\r\nsuperintendency of Barry, was ready for launching at Philadelphia. The\r\noriginal commission is in possession of Barry's grand-niece, Mrs. W.\r\nHorace Hepburn, of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nCaptain Barney declined appointment because of the rank--the\r\nfourth--assigned him. Captain James Sever was appointed but given the\r\nsixth place. Captain Nicholson, at Boston, on June 14, 1794,\r\ncongratulated Captain Barry on his \"honorable appointment to the Command\r\nof our Navy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Captain Barry,\" says Cooper's _History of the Navy_, \"was the only one\r\nof the six surviving Captains of the Revolutionary War who was not born\r\nin America, but he had passed nearly all his life in it and was\r\nthoroughly identified with his adopted countrymen in interest and\r\nfeeling. He had often distinguished himself during the Revolution and,\r\nperhaps, of all the naval Captains that remained, he was the one who\r\npossessed the greatest reputation for experience, conduct and skill. His\r\nappointment met with general approbation. Nor did anything ever occur to\r\ngive the Government reason to regret its selection.\"\r\n\r\nSo the County Wexford Irish Catholic boy had become the\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the new Navy of the new Constitutional United\r\nStates. Appointed by Washington, \"the Father of His Country,\" Barry thus\r\nbecame \"the Father of the American Navy,\" in the many distinguished sons\r\nof the sea who were trained under him.\r\n\r\nHis commission reads, \"to take rank from the fourth day of June, one\r\nthousand seven hundred and ninety-four.\"\r\n\r\n   There are gallant hearts whose glory\r\n     Columbia loves to name,\r\n   Whose deeds shall live in story\r\n     And everlasting fame.\r\n   But never yet one braver\r\n     Our starry banner bore\r\n   Than saucy old Jack Barry\r\n     The Irish Commodore.\r\n\r\n--_William Collins_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n   APPOINTED TO SUPERINTEND THE BUILDING OF THE FRIGATE, THE \"UNITED\r\n   STATES,\" THE FIRST OF THE NEW NAVY--GOES TO GEORGIA TO SELECT TIMBER\r\n   FOR THE FOUR FRIGATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn April 12, 1794, Joshua Humphreys, of Philadelphia, was directed by\r\nGeneral Knox, Secretary of War--there was no Department of the Navy\r\nuntil 1798--to prepare models for the frame of the frigates to be built.\r\nOn June 28th, Humphreys was appointed \"Constructor or Master-Builder of\r\na 44-gun ship to be built at the port of Philadelphia at the rate of\r\n$2000 per annum--the compensation commencing on the 1st of May last, in\r\nconsideration of your incessant application to the public interest in\r\nadjusting the principles of the ships, drawing drafts and making moulds,\r\netc.\"\r\n\r\nOn August 7th, General Knox notified Captain Barry: \"You are to consider\r\nyourself as the Superintendent of the frigate to be built at the port of\r\nPhiladelphia and which is to mount 44 guns.\" This frigate was named the\r\n\"United States.\" It was built on the Delaware River at the foot of [now]\r\nWashington Avenue near the old Swedes Church. It was constructed mainly\r\nof Georgia live oak, \"the most durable wood in the world,\" selected by\r\nCaptain Barry who, in October, 1794, by direction of Tench Coxe,\r\nCommissioner of the Revenues, proceeded to that State for that purpose,\r\nsailing on the brig \"Schuylkill\" which carried oxen and horses which\r\nwere \"of the highest importance to the expediting of the timber for the\r\nseveral frigates,\" to which Captain Barry was to give all possible\r\nexertions \"to the cutting and transportation of the timber for his own\r\nand every other frigate.\"\r\n\r\nOn October 14th the \"Schuylkill\" arrived at Gashayes Bluff, on the\r\nisland of St. Simon, where he found Mr. John T. Morgan, superintendent\r\nof cutting the timber, but not \"a stick of wood cut.\" Barry sent him\r\n\"into the country to try and get hands.\" He got six. Barry succeeded in\r\ngetting ten more. So that on the 20th Morgan set the sixteen at work. On\r\nthe 22d eighty-one woodcutters arrived from New London. They were set to\r\nwork. Barry after \"doing all in his power at St. Simon's\" went to\r\nSavannah to charter a vessel--returned to St. Simon's and thence to\r\nPhiladelphia, wherefrom, he, on November 10th, reported to Commissioner\r\nCoxe.\r\n\r\nOn December 12th he presented his bill of expenses for \"Voyage to\r\nGeorgia on Public Account.\" He had been given $200. His expenses\r\namounted to $124.24. So he returned $75.76.\r\n\r\nHis salary as Captain of the Navy was $75 a month.\r\n\r\nCaptains Barry, Dale and Truxtun on December 18, 1794, wrote the\r\nSecretary of War that the frigates could be built and equipped next\r\nyear, adding, \"It would be highly gratifying to us who have thrown aside\r\nour former occupations and the prospects that were fair for increasing\r\nour fortunes, with a view of serving our country, and who have no desire\r\nof being mere sinecure officers if we could at this moment embark and\r\nobey the commands of our country, in going in pursuit of a barbarous\r\nenemy, who now holds in chains and slavery so many of our unfortunate\r\nfellow-citizens; the relieving and restoring of which to the bosom of\r\ntheir families and friends are, with that of having an opportunity to\r\nchastise their cruel oppressors, objects of our greatest ambition and\r\nwhich we anticipate with all the ardor of officers, of seamen and of\r\ncitizens.\"\r\n\r\nBut no haste was made in building the frigates. Temporary diplomatic\r\narrangements with France quieted or averted action. Our country paid\r\ntribute to the Barbary State and sent barrels of silver to purchase\r\ntolerance on the sea from these pirates as a cheaper method of peace\r\nthan the cost and maintenance of armed vessels of war would be.\r\n\r\nBy the Act of March 27, 1794, work on the frigates was to cease in the\r\nevent of peace being signed with Algiers. So when on December 21, 1795,\r\nWashington informed the Senate that the Emperor of Morocco had signed a\r\ntreaty of peace and friendship with the United States, work on the\r\nfrigates was suspended. Washington called the attention of Congress to\r\nthe loss that would come if the work ceased, whereupon on April 20,\r\n1796, Congress ordered the unexpended balance to be used, but ordered\r\nthe work to be discontinued. Yet President Washington in his message had\r\ndeclared: \"To secure respect for a neutral flag requires a naval force\r\norganized and ready to vindicate it from insult or aggression.... Our\r\ntrade to the Mediterranean, without a protecting force, will always be\r\ninsecure. Will it not then be advisable to begin without delay to\r\nprovide and lay up materials for the building and equipping of ships of\r\nwar and to proceed with the work by degrees, in proportion as our\r\nresources shall render it practicable, without inconvenience so that a\r\nfuture war of Europe may not find our commerce in the unprotected state\r\nin which it was found by the present.\"\r\n\r\nThe cannon for the frigates had been cast at Cecil Furnace, Maryland.\r\nCaptain Barry, on May 16, 1796, was sent there \"to see the guns and\r\nexamine whether they were suitable or fit for service.\"\r\n\r\nThe frigate \"United States\" was progressing rapidly towards completion.\r\nCaptain Barry, on September 19, 1796, estimated the cost of fitting out\r\nfor officers and men at $7285. The vessel when completed cost $299,336.\r\nShe was 175 feet in length, 44 feet beam and of 1576 tonnage. She was\r\nlaunched May 10, 1797.\r\n\r\n\"In the long list of splendid vessels which in a hundred combats have\r\nmaintained the honor of our national flag, the 'United States' stands at\r\nthe head.\" She served our country well in the war with France under\r\nBarry; also in the war with England in 1812-15 and in subsequent duties,\r\npeaceful or warlike.\r\n\r\n\r\nLINES ON THE DEATH OF COMMODORE BARRY.\r\n\r\nBY MICHAEL FORTUNE.\r\n\r\n   Columbia's friend, freed from this worldly coil,\r\n   Now rests (so Heav'n ordains) from human toil;\r\n   A Patriot firm, thro' chequer'd life unblam'd,\r\n   A gallant vet'ran, for his powers fam'd.\r\n   Beneath his guidance, lo! a Navy springs,\r\n   An infant Navy spreads its canvas wings,\r\n   A rising Nation's weal, to shield, to save,\r\n   And guard her Commerce on the dang'rous wave.\r\n\r\n   Whoe'er the Sage, his character shall scan,\r\n   Must trace those Virtues that exalt the man,\r\n   The bold achievement and heroic deed\r\n   To honor's fame, the laurel'd Brave that lead,\r\n   Long for his merits and unsully'd name\r\n   (Dear to his friends and sanctify'd name);\r\n   His clay cold relics shall his country mourn,\r\n   And with her tears bedew his hallow'd urn.\r\n\r\n   Come, cheering Hope--celestial cherub come--\r\n   Say that his virtues soar beyond the tomb,\r\n   Say that with Mercy in ethereal guise,\r\n   His white-robed spirit climbs yon op'ning skies.\r\n\r\n(Philadelphia, Sept., 1803.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n   LAUNCH OF THE \"UNITED STATES\"--WAR WITH FRANCE--BARRY COMMANDS THE\r\n   AMERICAN FLEET IN THE WEST INDIES--CAPTURES THE \"SAN PAREIL\"--AGAIN\r\n   SENT TO THE WEST INDIES--BARRY FIRES ON THE FRENCH BATTERIES AT BASSE\r\n   TERRE--TO FRANCE AGAIN--DEATH OF OUR HERO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe frigate \"United States\" though launched in May, 1797, was not ready\r\nfor sea until July, 1798, when, on 3d July, the new Secretary of the new\r\nDepartment--the Navy--Hon. Benjamin Stoddert, directed Captain Barry \"to\r\nproceed to sea with the first fair wind,\" and expressing President\r\nAdams' \"conviction that nothing on your part will be wanting to justify\r\nthe high confidence reposed by him and your country in your activity,\r\nskill and bravery.\"\r\n\r\nHe was directed to cruise \"from Cape Henry to Nantucket,\" to \"defend\r\nthis extent of coast against the depredations of the vessels sailing\r\nunder authority or pretence of authority of the French Republic,\" and to\r\n\"afford all possible protection to the vessels of the United States\r\ncoming on or going off the coast,\" in conjunction with Captain Dale.\r\nCaptain Barry was authorized \"to subdue, seize and take any armed French\r\nvessel which should be found within the jurisdictional limits of the\r\nUnited States or elsewhere on the high seas, with apparel, guns and\r\nappurtenances.\" On July 11, 1798, Secretary Stoddert notified Barry that\r\ninformation was received that \"the French have considerable force in the\r\nWest Indies\" and that \"it is thought that a small squadron under the\r\ncommand of an officer of your intelligence, experience and bravery might\r\nrender essential service and animate your country to enterprise by\r\npicking up a number of prizes in the short cruise of these islands.\"\r\n\r\nSo Barry was directed to take the \"Delaware,\" Captain Stephen Decatur;\r\nthe \"Herald,\" Captain Sever, and a revenue cutter of 14 guns from Boston\r\n\"and to proceed to the West Indies and so dispose of the vessels as to\r\nafford the greatest chance of falling in with French armed vessels,\" to\r\n\"look into St. John's, the principal harbor of Porto Rico and after two\r\nor three days' cruising, return to the continent.\"\r\n\r\n\"The object of the enterprise,\" said the Secretary, \"is to do as much\r\ninjury to the armed vessels of France and to make as many captures as\r\npossible.\" He closed saying, \"It is scarcely necessary for me, in\r\nwriting to a brave man who values his own country, its government and\r\nits laws, to suggest the usefulness of inculcating upon those under his\r\ncommand the propriety of preserving in their language and conduct the\r\nsame respect which he himself feels for those constitutions and those\r\ncharacters which deserve the respect of all. It is time we should\r\nestablish an American character. Let that character be a love of country\r\nand a jealousy of its honor. This idea comprehends everything that ought\r\nto be impressed upon the minds of all our citizens, but more especially\r\nof those citizens who are seamen and soldiers.\"\r\n\r\nBarry was directed, when at St. John [San Juan], to write the Governor\r\nrequesting that the American seamen who had collected there to return to\r\nthe United States should be permitted to do so, but as the United States\r\nwas at peace with Spain no hostile measures were to be taken to obtain\r\nthem if the civil authorities should not produce them. Barry and Decatur\r\nsailed northward and off the coast of New England. On July 26, 1798,\r\nthey sailed for the West Indies, the revenue cutter not being ready to\r\nproceed with them. The \"United States\" and the \"Delaware\" returned to\r\nPhiladelphia September 21, 1798. Captain Barry had captured the French\r\nschooner \"Le Jaleux,\" of 14 guns and 70 men and also the \"San Pareil,\"\r\nof 10 guns and 67 men, belonging to Guadeloupe. The \"San Pareil,\" in\r\n1794, captured the vessel on which Charles and Catharine, children of\r\nCharles Carroll, of Carrollton, were returning from England. Proceeding\r\nto the West Indies the \"San Pareil\" fell in with the \"Pallas\" bound to\r\nthe Kennebeck and compelled her to take the passengers and crew to\r\nBoston. [Rowland's _Carroll_ II, p. 200.]\r\n\r\nNow Barry had captured the \"San Pareil.\" The crews were imprisoned at\r\nNew Castle, Del., until November 6th, where it was alleged, by opponents\r\nof the Adams administration, they were cruelly treated by being\r\nneglected and uncared for. \"The government allowed nothing, though it\r\nfurnished blankets. The French Consul had neither funds nor orders to\r\ngive his countrymen relief.\" Secretary Stoddert, then resident at\r\nTrenton, New Jersey, because of the yellow fever, wrote President Adams,\r\nat Quincy, Massachusetts, that \"Barry returned too soon. His reason,\r\napprehensions from the hurricanes in the West Indies at this season.\r\nUpon the whole, it is better than to have kept the ships sleeping on our\r\nown shore, though the result of the enterprise falls very far short of\r\nmy hopes.\"\r\n\r\nYet the Secretary had when reporting to the President that Barry had\r\nbeen sent to the West Indies \"to be employed while the French have but\r\nlittle force\" and that \"the hurricane season\" was near, had yet \"hopes\"\r\nthat neither Barry nor Decatur had been able to satisfy. By direction of\r\nthe President both were, on September 28, 1798, sent out again--\"Decatur\r\nto cruise from the Delaware to Cape Henry and Barry to cruise from the\r\nDelaware along the eastern coast northward\"--though the Secretary had\r\ninformed the President \"it is not to be apprehended that our coasts will\r\nbe much molested by French cruisers,\" as they had no force in the West\r\nIndies equal to ours \"and it was not probable they could send a force\r\nfrom Europe.\" Barry and Decatur were ordered to return about November\r\n15th. Barry on the cruise was \"to protect the trade from Delaware to New\r\nHampshire, while Decatur did the same from New York to the Chesapeake.\"\r\n\r\nBarry sailed from New Castle on October 8th without \"a single article\r\nfor the ship but ballast and,\" so he wrote Mrs. Barry, \"my reason for\r\ngoing to sea without these is the European ships are expected any day\r\nand should any of them be taken and I lying in the harbor, the merchants\r\nmay blame me and no other, although it would not be my fault.\" Barry\r\nreturned on November 9th \"totally unexpected,\" as an \"accident had\r\nprevented the 'United States' from getting to Newport,\" where the ship\r\nhad been expected to appear.\r\n\r\nOn November 29, 1798, Captains Barry, Dale, Truxtun and Tingley were\r\ndirected to report upon \"a proper system for the government of the\r\nNavy.\" He had previously recommended the establishment of Navy Yards and\r\norganization of a Navy Department. The War Department had, previous to\r\n1798, directed all naval affairs. At the opening of Congress in\r\nDecember, 1798, President Adams, in his Message, declared the law of\r\nFrance, that \"neutral vessels with British fabrics or produce, although\r\nthe entire property belonging to neutrals, were liable to seizure,\" was\r\nan \"unequivocal act of war on the commerce of the nation it attacks,\"\r\nand so \"whether we negotiate with her or not, a vigorous preparation for\r\nwar will be alike indispensable.\" He urged the increase of the Navy.\r\nCongress in February, 1799, added six 74's and six 18's to the naval\r\nforce at a cost of $2,400,000. The naval appropriation for 1799 amounted\r\nto $4,594,677.\r\n\r\nOn December 7, 1798, Captain Barry was placed in \"immediate command\" of\r\nthe frigates the \"United States,\" the \"Constitution,\" the \"George\r\nWashington,\" the \"Merrimac\" with four or five more vessels of nearly the\r\nsame force as the latter (24 guns). The fleet was to be employed in the\r\nWest Indies in active operations for the \"protection of our commerce and\r\nfor the capture or destruction of French armed vessels from St.\r\nChristopher's as far as Barbadoes and Tobago,\" and to \"pay considerable\r\nattention to Cayenne and Curricoa and even to the passage from the\r\nUnited States to Laguayra, on the Spanish Main, to which place our\r\ncitizens carry on considerable trade,\" but above all, Barry was \"to\r\nrelieve our commerce from the piccaroons and pirates continually issuing\r\nfrom the Island of Guadeloupe.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Truxtun was assigned \"from St. Christopher's to Porto Rico,\"\r\nwith two or three vessels of 14 and 18 guns. Captain Decatur, with one\r\nbrig of 16 guns, \"the vicinity of Havana,\" and Captain Tingley in the\r\n\"Ganges,\" \"between Cuba and Hispaniola,\" to give security to the trade\r\nof Jamaica.\r\n\r\nThe expedition was designed \"to rid those seas as well of French armed\r\nvessels as of the pirates which infest them.\"\r\n\r\nBarry was directed to \"proceed as early as possible to Prince Rupert's\r\nBay in the Island of Dominica, where the other vessels\" of his command\r\nwere ordered to rendezvous and he was to \"commence operations.\" Under\r\nBarry's command on this expedition were Charles Stewart, Stephen\r\nDecatur, Jacob Jones, all of whom became famous in naval annals and\r\nobtained the highest positions. Barry's training and discipline\r\ndeveloped heroes after his death. When the squadron reached the West\r\nIndies, Barry's command consisted of the frigate \"United States,\" the\r\n\"Constitution,\" Captain Samuel Nicholson; the \"George Washington,\"\r\nCaptain Patrick Fletcher; the \"Merrimac,\" Captain Moses Brown; the\r\n\"Portsmouth,\" Captain Daniel McNeill; the \"Pickering,\" Master-Commandant\r\nEdward Preble; the \"Eagle,\" Lieutenant Hugh George Campbell; the \"Herald,\"\r\nLieutenant Charles Russell; the \"Scammel,\" Lieutenant J. Adams, and the\r\n\"Diligence,\" Lieutenant J. Brown. The vessels sailing from Norfolk,\r\nVirginia, in company with Barry's frigate the \"United States\" were the\r\n\"Constellation,\" of 36 guns; the \"John Adams,\" the \"Congress,\" the\r\n\"Little Adams,\" the \"Little York,\" all of 32 guns; the \"Connecticut,\"\r\nthe \"Boston,\" the \"General Green,\" of 36 guns; the \"Siren\" and \"Argus,\"\r\nof 16 guns, and the \"Enterprise,\" 14 guns. All ships \"must claim your\r\nattention as well as your own,\" directed Secretary Stoddert.\r\n\r\nThe \"Constellation\" \"cruised for about three months without finding any\r\ngame,\" until she captured the \"Insurgente,\" of 50 guns and 700 men of\r\nwhom 350 were killed or wounded. The \"Constellation\" met a French, 74,\r\nlater but the enemy being of superior force the \"Constellation\" \"got out\r\nof reach.\" The next day the \"United States\" met the same French vessel\r\nand after an exchange of a few shots, Captain Barry also thought it\r\nadvisable to withdraw, as his ship had become \"dismasted\" and had to go\r\nto Bermuda for repairs, while the \"Constitution\" was \"much disabled in\r\nher mast and spars.\" Later Captain Nicholson captured the \"Carteret,\"\r\npacket \"and took her to St. Pierre\" and again chased a French privateer\r\ninto a harbor near that port.\r\n\r\nOn February 30, 1799, the \"United States,\" under Barry, gave chase to a\r\nFrench privateer. A well-aimed 24-pound shot was sufficient to \"cut the\r\ncareer of the privateer short,\" for the ball went through her hull so\r\nthat she quickly began to fill and settle. Captain Barry ordered the\r\nboats of his frigate to the rescue of the crew. Midshipman Stephen\r\nDecatur being in the first boat to reach the wreck and rescue the crew.\r\n\"They were plaintively imploring for help,\" wrote an eye-witness, \"with\r\nearnest gesticulations, not only from men but from God and although it\r\nis 'true they had abolished all religion they had not, it seemed, forgot\r\nthe old way of invoking the protection of the Omnipotent.'\"\r\n\r\nThe vessel was the \"Amour de la Patrie,\" of 6 guns and 80 men. All her\r\ncrew were saved. The \"United States\" also captured the \"Tartufe,\" of 8\r\nguns and 60 men. Desiring to relieve himself of his prisoners and hoping\r\nto make exchange of Americans imprisoned at Guadeloupe, Captain Barry\r\nsailed to Basse Terre flying a flag of truce, but was fired on by the\r\nFrench batteries. Hauling down the flag Barry returned the fire and\r\nbattered the walls so effectively that the marks of the American shot\r\nwere visible for many years. The \"Merrimac,\" Captain Moses Brown,\r\ncaptured \"Le Bonapart le Phenix,\" 14 guns, 128 men, and \"La Magiciene,\"\r\n14 guns, 63 men. The \"Portsmouth\" took \"La Bonapart\" (No. 2), \"Le\r\nBullante,\" \"Le Tripon\" and \"Le Bon Pere,\" of 6 guns and 52 men. Seven\r\nother captures made by the squadron.\r\n\r\nIt is not within the scope of this narration to record the operations\r\nof the fleet or the exertions of the several commanders of the\r\nrespective vessels composing it, but much that was creditable to our\r\nnaval forces was done though little that could be called brilliant or\r\nconspicuous, beyond the capture of the \"Insurgente\" by Truxtun and\r\nthe \"Amour de la Patrie\" and \"Tartufe\" by Barry. The main service of\r\nthe fleet was in protecting our merchant vessels and convoying them\r\nto safe waters.\r\n\r\nCommodore Barry was not in good health while on this expedition. This,\r\nthe Secretary of the Navy, writing to him, 15th March, 1799, chose to\r\n\"attribute to vexation for not being able to fall in with the French\"\r\nthan to the effects of the climate. He had the \"most entire confidence\"\r\nthat when joined by the other vessels Barry would \"afford the greatest\r\npossible protection to our commerce and punish the depredation on it.\"\r\n\r\nBarry had been joined by the \"Constitution,\" the \"Washington\" and the\r\n\"Merrimac\" and would later have under his command the \"Portsmouth,\" the\r\n\"Herald,\" the \"Pickering,\" the \"Diligence,\" the \"Scammel\" and the\r\n\"Eagle.\" Secretary Stoddert notified him, and also that if his health\r\nobliged him to return, Captain Truxtun would take command of the fleet\r\nand of the operations.\r\n\r\nOn St. Patrick's Day, 1799, Captain Barry was at Prince Rupert's Island.\r\nThe Hibernian Society of Philadelphia for the Relief of Emigrants from\r\nIreland were, the same day, at dinner at Shane's Tavern and drank to the\r\ntoast of\r\n\r\n\"COMMODORE BARRY AND THE NEW NAVY.\"\r\n\r\nOn April 8, 1799, Captain Barry was at Bridgetown, Barbadoes. For that\r\nport he had, as the youthful Captain of the schooner \"Barbadoes,\" sailed\r\nfrom Philadelphia on October 2, 1766, almost a third of a century\r\nprevious. What thoughts must have moved him we may conjecture at the\r\nchange in his own circumstances and in that of the country of his\r\nadoption which had taken place. Then, at twenty-one, he was commander of\r\nhis first vessel, a trading schooner of 60 tons. He had since made\r\neffective war upon the enemy of his native land and of his adopted\r\ncountry. He now entered Bridgetown the commander of a squadron of the\r\nchief armed vessels of his country. During the War for Independence he\r\nhad acted in cooperation with French naval forces, now he was protecting\r\nthe commerce of his country from the depredations of the French and\r\ninflicting punishment upon such as came in his path. He had made war on\r\nBritish naval vessels and taken captive many as well as those of\r\nEngland's merchant marine. Now he and his country were acting in accord\r\nwith England in opposition to and in restraint of the French.\r\n\r\nFriends had become enemies and enemies had become friendly, so much so\r\nthat a Barbadoes paper, on his arrival there, could declare: \"Whatever\r\ngood fortune attends Commodore Barry will but increase the public esteem\r\nwhich he already possesses, as to see merit rewarded is the generous\r\nwish of every British bosom.\"\r\n\r\nWhat a change!\r\n\r\nThis praise arose from the fact that Barry meeting the French privateer\r\n\"Democrat\" took from her the British Letter-of-Marque, \"Cicero,\" which\r\nhad been captured by the \"Democrat.\" The darkness debarred Barry from\r\ncapturing the \"Democrat\" also. The \"Cicero\" was of 450 tons and 50 men.\r\nHer Captain and three of the crew had been killed and thirty-six\r\nwounded. She had been in possession of the French for thirty-six hours\r\nwhen retaken by the \"United States\" with the prize crew of thirty taken\r\nprisoners. These he left at Guadeloupe in French possession. As there\r\nwere no American prisoners there Barry thought it better to do so than\r\nto have them on the \"United States\" frigate \"to eat more than they were\r\nworth.\"\r\n\r\nOn April 15, 1799, the Navy Department recalled the \"United States,\" the\r\n\"Constitution\" and the \"Washington,\" \"with all possible expedition.\" The\r\nother vessels were left in command of Captain Truxtun. Barry, in the\r\n\"United States,\" arrived at New Castle, Delaware, May 9, 1799, and\r\nwithin a month at the opera it was sung that \"the gallant Barry\" was \"by\r\nall Columbia's sons adored.\" He was then in Philadelphia after leaving\r\nLieutenant Charles Stewart in charge of the frigate. Barry was, on 13th\r\nMay, directed to discharge the crew whose time expired that or next\r\nmonth, so as to give them \"an opportunity of spending their money,\" that\r\nthey might the sooner re-enlist for another year. Officers were directed\r\n\"to open rendezvous for recruiting a crew.\" In the meantime Captain\r\nTruxtun had arrived at Norfolk and was received with \"every mark of\r\nrespect and attention.\" Captain James Barron was there also, but on June\r\n2d Barry requested his return to Philadelphia as necessity obliged his\r\npresence, as the President had directed the Secretary of the Navy to\r\nsend \"us as soon as possible to protect our defenceless coast.\"\r\nLieutenant Stewart, almost daily, sent reports of the overhauling work\r\ngoing on preparing the frigate for a voyage. The French privateers were\r\nactive along the coast harassing the merchantmen, and so audacious as\r\neven to enter our harbors.\r\n\r\nThis made \"the public mind very uneasy.\" So on June 29th the frigate\r\nsailed under orders to cruise along the coast to Charleston and after\r\nremaining there \"long enough to let the citizens know\" he was \"in the\r\nvicinity\"; he was to \"proceed further south, indeed as far as the River\r\nSt. Mary's,\" if he could return to Hampton Roads by the middle of July,\r\nwhere the \"Constitution,\" Captain Talbot, would join the \"United\r\nStates,\" as it was intended to send both to the coasts of France and\r\nSpain. This did not come to be, however, as it was found necessary to\r\nhave the vessels in the West Indies as soon as they could operate there.\r\n\r\nBarry received \"the President's command\" that \"taking the 'Constitution'\r\nwith you, you proceed on a cruise to the Western Isles, to Madeira and\r\nTeneriffe and thence returning by Cayenne, Surinam and the Windward\r\nIslands, and reaching Guadeloupe about the middle of October where\r\nfurther orders would be handed\" him. Then both frigates were to proceed\r\nto San Domingo and enter the port of Cape Francois, so they might be\r\nseen by General Touissant with whom and the people he was to \"endeavor\r\nto cultivate a good understanding.\" After remaining two or three days\r\nthere he was to return to New York, leaving Captain Talbot in the\r\n\"Constitution\" at San Domingo to take command of that station. Barry was\r\ngiven leave, however, if time did not permit his going to Madeira and\r\nTeneriffe as well as the Western Isles, he might proceed no further than\r\nthe Western Isles.\r\n\r\n\"The protection of our commerce is the great object of the naval\r\narmament,\" said the Secretary, but on July 27th he notified Barry, \"the\r\nprojected enterprise to Europe must be given up,\" the frigate \"United\r\nStates\" had to \"remain on our coast for our protection at home.\" The\r\n\"Constellation\" was to be employed in the same way. Barry was to\r\n\"proceed from Hampton\" southward as far as St. Mary's River and thence\r\nback along the coast and take the best chance of falling in with the\r\nenemy until about September 10th, when he was to return to New York if\r\nthe frigate could pass the bar--if not then to proceed to Newport, to\r\nwhich latter he did, where he remained until sailing for France.\r\n\r\n\"On October 20, 1799, from Newport Harbor, R.I., Captain Barry notified\r\nthe Hon. Jonathan Dayton, of New Jersey, that Owen Smith whom he had\r\nrecommended as a midshipman for frigate 'United States' had, in many\r\ninstances, 'behaved himself in a manner very unbecoming a gentleman, and\r\nas I conceive it my indispensable duty to prevent every person of bad\r\nconduct from getting a footing in the infant navy, I have, at his own\r\nrequest, discharged him. Your nephew, Mr. Williamson, has been too\r\ntenderly brought up to follow sea life; I think his father had better\r\nseek some other mode of life for him.'\" (Crimmins' MS.)\r\n\r\nThe cruise ordered took six weeks, but no record of captures appears.\r\nThe coast had been protected. That was the end to be obtained--not\r\ncaptures--as a formal declaration of war had not been made by either the\r\nUnited States or France. Though commonly called \"the War with France\"\r\nbecause of actual hostilities having taken place, officially, war did\r\nnot exist between the two countries. It is not necessary for our purpose\r\nto detail the political course of the two nations with respect to the\r\ndifficulties between them, but when negotiations had so far progressed\r\nthat special Commissioners or Ministers were to proceed to France with a\r\nview of arranging a treaty, Captain Barry was, on October 16, 1799,\r\nnotified that \"the President has decided that the 'United States' shall\r\ncarry our envoys to Europe and you will hold yourself in readiness to\r\nperform that service by the first of November at the farthest.\"\r\n\r\nThe envoys were Chief Justice O. Ellsworth, R.W. Davis, ex-Governor of\r\nNorth Carolina, and W.V. Murray, U.S. Minister at The Hague--\"Envoys\r\nExtraordinary to the French Republic.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Barry had orders to land them at any part of France they\r\npreferred and to touch at any ports they desired. Captain Barry was\r\nindeed on an old service. He had carried Colonel John Laurens and\r\nLafayette to France to seek aid for America. Now he carried American\r\nenvoys to demand justice for American commerce and the cessation of\r\nhostile measures against its freedom.\r\n\r\nThe mission President Adams declared was sent at one of the \"most\r\ncritical, important and interesting moments that ever occurred\" in\r\nAmerican history. Again was Barry given the old order so often given him\r\nduring his Revolutionary career: \"You will not capture anything on the\r\nvoyage. This is a mortification to which it is necessary that you should\r\nsubmit. I hope to salute you an Admiral on your arrival at\r\nPhiladelphia.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Barry performed the duty assigned him and landed the envoys in\r\nFrance. After long negotiations a Treaty of Peace, Commerce and\r\nNavigation was agreed to September 30, 1800, with the First Consul\r\nBonaparte. It was ratified by the U.S. Senate February 3, 1801, by the\r\nFrench July 31, 1801, and proclaimed December 31, 1801.\r\n\r\nWashington died December 14, 1799. On the 20th Captain Barry received\r\nfrom the Navy Department a General Order of President Adams that all\r\nvessels should be \"put in mourning one week by wearing their colors at\r\nhalf-mast high.\" The officers to \"wear crape on the left arm below the\r\nelbow for six months.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1800 the \"United States\" frigate was not in active\r\nduty--the trouble with France having ceased, other occasions for her\r\nservices did not arise. Lieutenant Mullowney was promoted to the command\r\nof the \"Ganges\" and thirty-five of the seamen of the \"United States\"\r\ntransferred with him.\r\n\r\nOn July 16, 1800, Lieutenant Charles Stewart was given command of the\r\n\"Experiment,\" Captain Barry expressing the hope that \"he will be more\r\nactive than he was,\" a hope which was justified in his subsequent\r\ncareer. At this time Barry's vessel was undergoing repairs. He wrote the\r\nSecretary, \"she will not be out of the carpenter's hands until October.\"\r\nWhen she was ready for sea, Barry was directed \"to proceed to St. Kitts\r\nand assume command of your squadron on the Guadeloupe station, taking\r\nunder your convoy any merchant vessels ready to proceed for the Windward\r\nIslands; you have to protect our commerce to all the Islands and to\r\nguard our merchant vessels against all depredations from Porto Rico as\r\nwell as from Guadeloupe and other dependencies of France.\" Later the\r\nTreaty of September 30, 1800, arrived, when Barry was directed to \"treat\r\nthe armed vessels of France, public and private, exactly as you find\r\nthey treat our trading vessels.\"\r\n\r\nUp to that time seventy-four French vessels had been taken and more than\r\neighty had been retaken from the French. This was regarded as ample\r\nproof of the value of a Navy and made its advocates so jubilant that\r\n\"What think ye of the Navy now?\" was tauntingly asked of its former\r\nopponents.\r\n\r\nSo again Captain Barry's services as Head of the Navy were conspicuous\r\nand useful. But the Federalists, the party of Washington, of Adams and\r\nof Barry, were defeated by the election by the House of Representatives\r\nof Thomas Jefferson.\r\n\r\nReform and Retrenchment were the chief policies of his administration.\r\nWith the measures against France, Jefferson's Republicans had had no\r\nsympathy. Their antipathy to Great Britain and their fury against Jay's\r\nTreaty were terrific. The new Congress of Jefferson ordered the\r\ncessation of work on the 74-gun ships, for which timber had already been\r\ncollected. Only a quarter of a million of dollars was appropriated for\r\nnaval expenditures. All but thirteen of the ships were sold. The new\r\nNavy established by the Act of 1794 was, within seven years, almost\r\nnon-existent and would have been wholly so if the policy of the\r\nJefferson Republicans had been fully carried out. Though that\r\npractically came to pass by the \"laying up\" of all vessels.\r\n\r\nJefferson was inaugurated March 4, 1801. On the 23d of that month\r\nCaptain Barry was notified to \"call home all the ships in the West\r\nIndies. You are to make the best of your way to Philadelphia.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of April the frigate \"United States\" was in the Delaware\r\nRiver and, on May 1st, the new Secretary of the Navy, General Dearborn,\r\ninstructed Barry to bring the \"United States\" to Washington, \"where it\r\nis intended she shall be laid up.\" There were now Navy yards at\r\nPortsmouth, N.H.; Charlestown, Philadelphia, Norfolk and Washington, in\r\naccordance with the advice Captain Barry had given in 1798 that such\r\nshould be established and a Navy Department created.\r\n\r\nCaptain Barry sailed the frigate to Washington and on May 23d reported\r\nhis arrival in the Potomac, \"though his friends had declared that the\r\nPresident was not aware of the difficulties that would be met in getting\r\nthe frigate there,\" as Mrs. Barry wrote the Captain the day he had\r\narrived near Washington.\r\n\r\nThe first frigate of the New Navy was \"laid up\"--was at rest--had ceased\r\noperations, not because its usefulness was at an end and it might no\r\nmore be serviceable, nor would there be occasion for her power as a\r\nprotector of American commerce, but because the political policy of the\r\nParty in power did not sanction the possession of a Navy.\r\n\r\nSo having fulfilled its mission and its commander having obeyed\r\ninstructions and brought the first born of the new Navy to the new\r\nCapital of the new nation he was, on June 6, 1801, notified:\r\n\r\n   \"You have permission to retire to your place of residence and there\r\n   remain until the government again requires your services.\"\r\n\r\nThe frigate \"United States\" served our country well in the War with\r\nFrance, in the War with Great Britain, 1812-15, and in subsequent\r\nduties, warlike and peaceful, until the War between the States, 1861-65,\r\nwhen while laid up \"in ordinary\" at the Norfolk Navy Yard she was, by\r\nthe Confederates, sunk to obstruct the channel. After the war she was\r\nraised and in January, 1866, broken up, though Commodore Hitchcock\r\nendeavored to have her preserved, saying \"if her value were only\r\nmeasured by dollars it may be unwise to attempt her preservation, but\r\nideas and sentiments cannot be judged by such a standard. What is the\r\nuse of being rich and great and powerful if we cannot afford to indulge\r\nbecoming sentiments and cherish the memory of the bright deeds of our\r\nhistory.\" But she was broken up. All that remains as visible objects of\r\nher are two of her guns on the exhibition grounds of the Navy Yard at\r\nPortsmouth, Va.\r\n\r\nThe Navy was, on June 11, 1801, by President Jefferson, put on \"a peace\r\nestablishment.\" Of the Captains nine were retained, of Lieutenants\r\nthirty-six and of Midshipmen one hundred and fifty. Captain Barry was\r\n\"one of those retained,\" he was notified. Half-pay was allowed from July\r\n1, 1801.\r\n\r\nCaptain Barry's health was now failing. On returning to Philadelphia he\r\nwas, in November, 1801, engaged in proving guns cast by Mr. Lane. The\r\nnext year when directed to prove cannon at Colonel Hughes' works near\r\nHavre-de-Grace, Maryland, Barry's health did not permit him to go. On\r\nAugust 19, 1802, Barry, Dale and Bainbridge were appointed a Board to\r\nexamine applicants for admission to the Navy--the Barbary Powers were\r\nagain giving trouble to our merchant traders and imprisoning American\r\nseamen, and an idea that a more vigorous navy was needed and that\r\npaying tribute in money was degrading was gaining headway even among the\r\nRepublicans. So that on December 22, 1802, the Secretary of the Navy\r\nnotified Captain Barry, \"We shall have occasion to keep a small force in\r\nthe Mediterranean and we shall expect your services on that station.\"\r\nBut the old Warrior-Sailor was nearing another Station. Ill health was\r\nenfeebling him, destroying his wonted activity. The flame of the fire of\r\nhis ardor to serve his country was flickering so much as to remind him\r\nthat death might be nearing.\r\n\r\nSo on February 27, 1803, he made his will. During the summer at his\r\ncountry residence at Strawberry Hill in the Northern Liberties he remain\r\nincapacitated for any further sea or other services useful to the\r\ncountry, or beneficial to mankind in general. He died September 13,\r\n1803, and was buried from his City home on Chestnut Street below Tenth,\r\nsouth side, then No. 186. He was interred at St. Mary's graveyard the\r\nnext morning, according to the custom of those days. St. Mary's was the\r\nchurch where Commodore Barry \"was a constant attendant when in the\r\nCity,\" as Bishop Kenrick wrote Colonel B.U. Campbell, of Ellicott Mills,\r\nJanuary 15, 1844. [Balto. Archives, C.D. 14.] His estate amounted to\r\n$27,691. He is buried within a few feet of the entrance to the graveyard\r\nin the rear of the church. In the grave with him his two wives are\r\ninterred--Mary died in 1771, Sarah in 1831.\r\n\r\nBeside him northward lies his friend Captain John Rosseter, also of the\r\nCounty of Wexford, Ireland.\r\n\r\nAt the head of his grave to the northward is interred Captain Thomas\r\nFitzSimons, a signer of the Constitution of the United States, an\r\nofficer in the Revolution, a merchant of Philadelphia and Representative\r\nin Congress.\r\n\r\nAlso at the head of Barry's grave, southward, lies the mortal remains of\r\nGeorge Meade, a patriot of the Revolution and a merchant of\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\nThis is the most Catholic Irish-American historical plot of ground in\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nThree of these patriots were born in Ireland--George Meade, born in\r\nPhiladelphia of Irish parents.\r\n\r\nDr. Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, wrote\r\nthe first draft of the epitaph for the tomb of Captain Barry. It read:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLET THE PATRIOT, THE SOLDIER AND THE CHRISTIAN\r\nWHO VISITS THESE MANSIONS OF THE DEAD\r\nVIEW THIS MONUMENT WITH RESPECT\r\n\r\nBENEATH IT ARE INTERRED THE REMAINS OF\r\n\r\nJOHN BARRY\r\n\r\nHE WAS BORN IN THE COUNTY OF WEXFORD IN IRELAND\r\nBUT AMERICA WAS THE OBJECT OF HIS PATRIOTISM\r\nAND THE THEATRE OF HIS USEFULNESS.\r\n\r\nIN THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR WHICH ESTABLISHED THE\r\nINDEPENDENCE OF THE UNITED STATES HE\r\nBORE AN EARLY AND AN ACTIVE PART AS A CAPTAIN IN THEIR\r\nNAVY AND AFTER BECAME ITS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.\r\n\r\nHE FOUGHT OFTEN AND ONCE BLED IN THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM.\r\n\r\nHIS HABITS OF WAR DID NOT LESSEN HIS\r\nVIRTUES AS A MAN NOR HIS PIETY AS A CHRISTIAN.\r\n\r\nHE WAS GENTLE, KIND AND JUST IN PRIVATE LIFE,\r\nWAS NOT LESS BELOVED BY HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS THAN BY\r\nHIS GRATEFUL COUNTRY.\r\n\r\nTHE NUMBER AND OBJECTS OF HIS CHARITIES WILL BE\r\nKNOWN ONLY AT THAT TIME WHEN HIS DUST\r\nSHALL BE REANIMATED AND WHEN HE WHO SEES IN SECRET\r\nSHALL REWARD OPENLY.\r\n\r\nIN THE FULL BELIEF IN THE DOCTRINES OF THE GOSPEL\r\nHE PEACEFULLY RESIGNED HIS SOUL INTO THE ARMS OF HIS\r\nREDEEMER\r\n\r\nON THE 13TH OF SEPTEMBER, 1803, IN THE 59TH YEAR OF HIS AGE.\r\n\r\nHIS AFFECTIONATE WIDOW HATH CAUSED THIS MARBLE TO BE\r\nERECTED TO PERPETUATE HIS NAME AFTER THE HEARTS OF HIS\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS HAVE CEASED TO BE\r\nTHE LIVING RECORD OF HIS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE VIRTUES.\r\n\r\nAs cut on the tombstone after revision the epitaph was substantially the\r\nsame. \"Interred\" was changed to \"deposited\"; \"theatre\" was stricken out\r\nand \"aim\" inserted and \"honor\" added after \"usefulness\"; \"became\" was\r\nchanged to \"was\"; \"Virtues as a Man\" was made to read \"the power of the\r\nvirtues which adorn private life\"; \"charitable\" was added after \"just\"\r\nand the sentence relating to the number and objects of his charities\r\nstricken out; \"in the 59th year of his age\" was omitted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOMB OF COMMODORE BARRY, ST. MARY'S GRAVEYARD,\r\nPHILADELPHIA]\r\n\r\nIn 1876, the original tomb having fallen into decay, a new tomb--the\r\npresent one--was erected by contributions of the members of St. Mary's\r\nChurch. The epitaph having become illegible the compiler of this record\r\nsupplied a copy of the epitaph as it had been cut on the first stone.\r\nBut Rev. Wm. F. Martin, the Pastor of the church, had the epitaph cut so\r\nas to read, and now may be seen, as follows:\r\n\r\nSACRED TO THE MEMORY OF COMMODORE JOHN BARRY, FATHER OF\r\nTHE AMERICAN NAVY.\r\n\r\nLET THE CHRISTIAN, PATRIOT AND SOLDIER WHO VISITS THESE\r\nMANSIONS OF THE DEAD VIEW THIS MONUMENT WITH RESPECT\r\nAND VENERATION.\r\n\r\nBENEATH IT RESTS THE REMAINS OF JOHN BARRY, WHO WAS\r\nBORN IN THE COUNTY WEXFORD, IRELAND, IN THE YEAR 1745.\r\n\r\nAMERICA WAS THE OBJECT OF HIS PATRIOTISM AND THE AIM OF\r\nHIS USEFULNESS AND AMBITION.\r\n\r\nAT THE BEGINNING OF THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR HE HELD THE\r\nCOMMISSION OF CAPTAIN IN THE THEN LIMITED NAVY OF THE\r\nCOLONIES.\r\n\r\nHIS ACHIEVEMENTS IN BATTLE AND HIS RENOWNED NAVAL TACTICS\r\nMERITED FOR HIM THE POSITION OF COMMODORE AND TO BE\r\nJUSTLY REGARDED AS THE FATHER OF THE AMERICAN NAVY.\r\n\r\nHE FOUGHT OFTEN AND BLED IN THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM, BUT\r\nHIS DEEDS OF VALOR DID NOT DIMINISH IN HIM THE VIRTUES\r\nWHICH ADORN HIS PRIVATE LIFE.\r\n\r\nHE WAS EMINENTLY GENTLE, KIND, JUST AND CHARITABLE AND\r\nNO LESS BELOVED BY HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS THAN BY HIS\r\nGRATEFUL COUNTRY.\r\n\r\nFIRM IN THE FAITH AND PRACTICES OF THE ROMAN CATHOLIC\r\nCHURCH, HE DEPARTED THIS LIFE ON THE 13TH DAY OF\r\nSEPTEMBER IN THE 59TH YEAR OF HIS AGE.\r\n\r\nIN GRATEFUL REMEMBRANCE, A FEW OF HIS COUNTRYMEN, MEMBERS\r\nOF ST.

The Navy that from the beginning has been the admiration and\r\nmodel of all the nations of the earth.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STATUE OF COMMODORE BARRY, INDEPENDENCE SQUARE,\r\nPHILADELPHIA]\r\n\r\nOn March 22, 1902, the torpedo boat destroyer the \"Barry\" was launched\r\nat the Neafie & Levy's shipyard.
