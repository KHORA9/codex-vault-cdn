If, in spite of this, I presume to\r\ninscribe your name in its first page, I do so because I have a freedom\r\nin this matter which you have not, because I covet much to be associated\r\npublicly with you, and because I trust to gain your forgiveness for a\r\nsomewhat violent proceeding, on the plea that I may perhaps thereby be\r\navailing myself of the only opportunity given to me, if not the most\r\nsuitable occasion, of securing what I so earnestly desire.\r\n\r\nI desire it, because I desire to acknowledge the debt I owe you for\r\nkindnesses and services rendered to me through a course of years. All\r\nalong, from the time that the Oratory first came to this place, you have\r\ntaken a warm interest in me and in my doings. You found me out\r\ntwenty-four years ago on our first start in the narrow streets of\r\nBirmingham, before we could well be said to have a home or a church. And\r\nyou have never been wanting to me since, or spared time or trouble, when\r\nI had occasion in any difficulty to seek your guidance or encouragement.\r\n\r\nEspecially have I cause to remember the help you gave me, by your\r\nprudent counsels and your anxious sympathy, when I was called over to\r\nIreland to initiate a great Catholic institution. From others also,\r\necclesiastics and laymen, I received a hearty welcome and a large\r\nassistance, which I ever bear in mind; but you, when I would fill the\r\nProfessors' chairs, were in a position to direct me to the men whose\r\ngenius, learning, and zeal became so great a part of the life and\r\nstrength of the University; and, even as regards those whose high\r\nendowments I otherwise learned, or already knew myself, you had your\r\npart in my appointments, for I ever tried to guide myself by what I had\r\ngained from the conversations and correspondence which you had from time\r\nto time allowed me. To you, then, my dear Lord, more than to any other,\r\nI owe my introduction to a large circle of friends, who faithfully\r\nworked with me in the course of my seven years of connexion with the\r\nUniversity, and who now, for twice seven years since, have generously\r\nkept me in mind, though I have been out of their sight.\r\n\r\nThere is no one, then, whom I more intimately associate with my life in\r\nDublin than your Lordship; and thus, when I revive the recollections of\r\nwhat my friends there did for me, my mind naturally reverts to you; and\r\nagain in making my acknowledgments to you, I am virtually thanking\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThat you may live for many years, in health, strength, and usefulness,\r\nthe centre of many minds, a blessing to the Irish people, and a light in\r\nthe Universal Church, is,\r\n\r\n                              MY DEAR LORD,\r\n                                  The fervent prayer of\r\n                               Your affectionate friend and servant,\r\n\r\n                                                JOHN HENRY NEWMAN.\r\n   BIRMINGHAM,\r\n  _October 23, 1872._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nLECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF THE TURKS,\r\n\r\nIN THEIR RELATION TO EUROPE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFATORY NOTICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following sketch of Turkish history was the substance of Lectures\r\ndelivered in the Catholic Institute of Liverpool during October, 1853.\r\nIt may be necessary for its author to state at once, in order to prevent\r\ndisappointment, that he only professes in the course of it to have\r\nbrought together in one materials which are to be found in any\r\nordinarily furnished library. Not intending it in the first instance for\r\npublication, but to answer a temporary purpose, he has, in drawing it\r\nup, sometimes borrowed words and phrases, to save himself trouble, from\r\nthe authorities whom he has consulted; and this must be taken as his\r\nexcuse, if any want of keeping is discernible in the composition. He has\r\nattempted nothing more than to group old facts in his own way; and he\r\ntrusts that his defective acquaintance with historical works and\r\ntravels, and the unreality of book-knowledge altogether in questions of\r\nfact, have not exposed him to superficial generalizations.\r\n\r\nOne other remark may be necessary. Such a work at the present moment,\r\nwhen we are on the point of undertaking a great war in behalf of the\r\nTurks, may seem without meaning, unless it conducts the reader to some\r\ndefinite conclusions, as to what is to be wished, what to be done, in\r\nthe present state of the East; but a minister of religion may fairly\r\nprotest against being made a politician. Political questions are mainly\r\ndecided by political expediency, and only indirectly and under\r\ncircumstances fall into the province of theology. Much less can such a\r\nquestion be asked of the priests of that Church, whose voice in this\r\nmatter has been for five centuries unheeded by the Powers of Europe. As\r\nthey have sown, so must they reap: had the advice of the Holy See been\r\nfollowed, there would have been no Turks in Europe for the Russians to\r\nturn out of it. All that need be said here in behalf of the Sultan is,\r\nthat the Christian Powers are bound to keep such lawful promises as they\r\nhave made to him. All that need be said in favour of the Czar is, that\r\nhe is attacking an infamous Power, the enemy of God and man. And all\r\nthat need be said by way of warning to the Catholic is, that he should\r\nbeware of strengthening the Czar's cause by denying or ignoring its\r\nstrong point. It is difficult to understand how a reader of history can\r\nside with the Spanish people in past centuries in their struggle with\r\nthe Moors, without wishing Godspeed, in mere consistency, to any\r\nChristian Power, which aims at delivering the East of Europe from the\r\nTurkish yoke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TURKS.\r\n\r\n  I.

In the earliest histories this\r\nconflict finds a place; and hence, when the inspired Prophets[1]\r\ndenounce defeat and captivity upon the chosen people or other\r\ntransgressing nations, who were inhabitants of the South, the North is\r\npointed out as the quarter from which the judgment is to descend.\r\n\r\nNor is this conflict, nor is its perpetuity, difficult of explanation.\r\nThe South ever has gifts of nature to tempt the invader, and the North\r\never has multitudes to be tempted by them. The North has been fitly\r\ncalled the storehouse of nations. Along the breadth of Asia, and thence\r\nto Europe, from the Chinese Sea on the East, to the Euxine on the West,\r\nnay to the Rhine, nay even to the Bay of Biscay, running between and\r\nbeyond the 40th and 50th degrees of latitude, and above the fruitful\r\nSouth, stretches a vast plain, which has been from time immemorial what\r\nmay be called the wild common and place of encampment, or again the\r\nhighway, or the broad horse-path, of restless populations seeking a\r\nhome. The European portion of this tract has in Christian times been\r\nreclaimed from its state of desolation, and is at present occupied by\r\ncivilized communities; but even now the East remains for the most part\r\nin its primitive neglect, and is in possession of roving barbarians.\r\n\r\nIt is the Eastern portion of this vast territory which I have pointed\r\nout, that I have now, Gentlemen, principally to keep before your view.\r\nIt goes by the general name of Tartary: in width from north to south it\r\nis said to vary from 400 to 1,100 miles, while in length from east to\r\nwest it is not far short of 5,000. It is of very different elevations in\r\ndifferent parts, and it is divided longitudinally by as many as three or\r\nfour mountain-chains of great height. The valleys which lie between them\r\nnecessarily confine the wandering savage to an eastward or westward\r\ncourse, and the slope of the land westward invites him to that direction\r\nrather than to the east. Then, at a certain point in these westward\r\npassages, as he approaches the meridian of the Sea of Aral, he finds the\r\nmountain-ranges cease, and open upon him the opportunity, as well as the\r\ntemptation, to roam to the North or to the South also. Up in the East,\r\nfrom whence he came, in the most northerly of the lofty ranges which I\r\nhave spoken of, is a great mountain, which some geographers have\r\nidentified with the classical Imaus; it is called by the Saracens Caf,\r\nby the Turks Altai. Sometimes too it has the name of the Girdle of the\r\nEarth, from the huge appearance of the chain to which it belongs,\r\nsometimes of the Golden Mountain, from the gold, as well as other\r\nmetals, with which its sides abound. It is said to be at an equal\r\ndistance of 2,000 miles from the Caspian, the Frozen Sea, the North\r\nPacific Ocean, and the Bay of Bengal: and, being in situation the\r\nfurthest withdrawn from West and South, it is in fact the high capital\r\nor metropolis of the vast Tartar country, which it overlooks, and has\r\nsent forth, in the course of ages, innumerable populations into the\r\nillimitable and mysterious regions around it, regions protected by their\r\ninland character both from the observation and the civilizing influence\r\nof foreign nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\nTo eat bread in the sweat of his brow is the original punishment of\r\nmankind; the indolence of the savage shrinks from the obligation, and\r\nlooks out for methods of escaping it. Corn, wine, and oil have no charms\r\nfor him at such a price; he turns to the brute animals which are his\r\naboriginal companions, the horse, the cow, and the sheep; he chooses to\r\nbe a grazier rather than to till the ground. He feeds his horses,\r\nflocks, and herds on its spontaneous vegetation, and then in turn he\r\nfeeds himself on their flesh. He remains on one spot while the natural\r\ncrop yields them sustenance; when it is exhausted, he migrates to\r\nanother. He adopts, what is called, the life of a _nomad_. In maritime\r\ncountries indeed he must have recourse to other expedients; he fishes in\r\nthe stream, or among the rocks of the beach.[2] In the woods he betakes\r\nhimself to roots and wild honey; or he has a resource in the chase, an\r\noccupation, ever ready at hand, exciting, and demanding no perseverance.\r\nBut when the savage finds himself inclosed in the continent and the\r\nwilderness, he draws the domestic animals about him, and constitutes\r\nhimself the head of a sort of brute polity. He becomes a king and father\r\nof the beasts, and by the economical arrangements which this pretension\r\ninvolves, advances a first step, though a low one, in civilization,\r\nwhich the hunter or the fisher does not attain.\r\n\r\nAnd here, beyond other animals, the horse is the instrument of that\r\ncivilization. It enables him to govern and to guide his sheep and\r\ncattle; it carries him to the chase, when he is tempted to it; it\r\ntransports him and his from place to place; while his very locomotion\r\nand shifting location and independence of the soil define the idea, and\r\nsecure the existence, both of a household and of personal property. Nor\r\nis this all which the horse does for him; it is food both in its life\r\nand in its death;--when dead, it nourishes him with its flesh, and,\r\nwhile alive, it supplies its milk for an intoxicating liquor which,\r\nunder the name of _koumiss_, has from time immemorial served the Tartar\r\ninstead of wine or spirits. The horse then is his friend under all\r\ncircumstances, and inseparable from him; he may be even said to live on\r\nhorseback, he eats and sleeps without dismounting, till the fable has\r\nbeen current that he has a centaur's nature, half man and half beast.\r\nHence it was that the ancient Saxons had a horse for their ensign in\r\nwar; thus it is that the Ottoman ordinances are, I believe, to this day\r\ndated from \"the imperial stirrup,\" and the display of horsetails at the\r\ngate of the palace is the Ottoman signal of war. Thus too, as the\r\nCatholic ritual measures intervals by \"a Miserere,\" and St Ignatius in\r\nhis Exercises by \"a Pater Noster,\" so the Turcomans and the Usbeks speak\r\nfamiliarly of the time of a gallop. But as to houses, on the other hand,\r\nthe Tartars contemptuously called them the sepulchres of the living,\r\nand, when abroad, could hardly be persuaded to cross a threshold. Their\r\nwomen, indeed, and children could not live on horseback; them some kind\r\nof locomotive dwelling must receive, and a less noble animal must draw.\r\nThe old historians and poets of Greece and Rome describe it, and the\r\ntravellers of the middle ages repeat and enlarge the classical\r\ndescription of it The strangers from Europe gazed with astonishment on\r\nhuge wattled houses set on wheels, and drawn by no less than twenty-two\r\noxen.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\nFrom the age of Job, the horse has been the emblem of battle; a mounted\r\nshepherd is but one remove from a knight-errant, except in the object of\r\nhis excursions; and the discipline of a pastoral station from the nature\r\nof the case is not very different from that of a camp. There can be no\r\ncommunity without order, and a community in motion demands a special\r\nkind of organization. Provision must be made for the separation, the\r\nprotection, and the sustenance of men, women, and children, horses,\r\nflocks, and cattle. To march without straggling, to halt without\r\nconfusion, to make good their ground, to reconnoitre neighbourhoods, to\r\nascertain the character and capabilities of places in the distance, and\r\nto determine their future route, is to be versed in some of the most\r\nimportant duties of the military art. Such pastoral tribes are already\r\nan army in the field, if not as yet against any human foe, at least\r\nagainst the elements. They have to subdue, or to check, or to\r\ncircumvent, or to endure the opposition of earth, water, and wind, in\r\ntheir pursuits of the mere necessaries of life. The war with wild beasts\r\nnaturally follows, and then the war on their own kind. Thus when they\r\nare at length provoked or allured to direct their fury against the\r\ninhabitants of other regions, they are ready-made soldiers. They have a\r\nsoldier's qualifications in their independence of soil, freedom from\r\nlocal ties, and practice in discipline; nay, in one respect they are\r\nsuperior to any troops which civilized countries can produce. One of the\r\nproblems of warfare is how to feed the vast masses which its operations\r\nrequire; and hence it is commonly said, that a well-managed commissariat\r\nis a chief condition of victory. Few people can fight without\r\neating;--Englishmen as little as any. I have heard of a work of a\r\nforeign officer, who took a survey of the European armies previously to\r\nthe revolutionary war; in which he praised our troops highly, but said\r\nthey would not be effective till they were supported by a better\r\ncommissariat. Moreover, one commonly hears, that the supply of this\r\ndeficiency is one of the very merits of the great Duke of Wellington. So\r\nit is with civilized races; but the Tartars, as is evident from what I\r\nhave already observed, have in their wars no need of any commissariat at\r\nall; and that, not merely from the unscrupulousness of their foraging,\r\nbut because they find in the instruments of their conquests the staple\r\nof their food. \"Corn is a bulky and perishable commodity,\" says an\r\nhistorian;[3] \"and the large magazines, which are indispensably\r\nnecessary for the subsistence of civilized troops, are difficult and\r\nslow of transport.\" But, not to say that even their flocks and herds\r\nwere fitted for rapid movement, like the nimble sheep of Wales and the\r\nwild cattle of North Britain, the Tartars could even dispense with these\r\naltogether. If straitened for provisions, they ate the chargers which\r\ncarried them to battle; indeed they seemed to account their flesh a\r\ndelicacy, above the reach of the poor, and in consequence were enjoying\r\na banquet in circumstances when civilized troops would be staving off\r\nstarvation. And with a view to such accidents, they have been accustomed\r\nto carry with them in their expeditions a number of supernumerary\r\nhorses, which they might either ride or eat, according to the occasion.\r\nIt was an additional advantage to them in their warlike movements, that\r\nthey were little particular whether their food had been killed for the\r\npurpose, or had died of disease. Nor is this all: their horses' hides\r\nwere made into tents and clothing, perhaps into bottles and coracles;\r\nand their intestines into bowstrings.[4]\r\n\r\nTrained then as they are, to habits which in themselves invite to war,\r\nthe inclemency of their native climate has been a constant motive for\r\nthem to seek out settlements and places of sojournment elsewhere. The\r\nspacious plains, over which they roam, are either monotonous grazing\r\nlands, or inhospitable deserts, relieved with green valleys or recesses.\r\nThe cold is intense in a degree of which we have no experience in\r\nEngland, though we lie to the north of them.[5] This arises in a measure\r\nfrom their distance from the sea, and again from their elevation of\r\nlevel, and further from the saltpetre with which their soil or their\r\natmosphere is impregnated. The sole influence then of their fatherland,\r\nif I may apply to it such a term, is to drive its inhabitants from it to\r\nthe West or to the South.\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nI have said that the geographical features of their country carry them\r\nforward in those two directions, the South and the West; not to say that\r\nthe ocean forbids them going eastward, and the North does but hold out\r\nto them a climate more inclement than their own. Leaving the district of\r\nMongolia in the furthermost East, high above the north of China, and\r\npassing through the long and broad valleys which I spoke of just now,\r\nthe emigrants at length would arrive at the edge of that elevated\r\nplateau, which constitutes Tartary proper. They would pass over the high\r\nregion of Pamer, where are the sources of the Oxus, they would descend\r\nthe terrace of the Bolor, and the steeps of Badakshan, and gradually\r\nreach a vast region, flat on the whole as the expanse they had left, but\r\nas strangely depressed below the level of the sea, as Tartary is lifted\r\nabove it.[6] This is the country, forming the two basins of the Aral and\r\nthe Caspian, which terminates the immense Asiatic plain, and may be\r\nvaguely designated by the name of Turkistan. Hitherto the necessity of\r\ntheir route would force them on, in one multitudinous emigration, but\r\nnow they may diverge, and have diverged. If they were to cross the\r\nJaxartes and the Oxus, and then to proceed southward, they would come to\r\nKhorasan, the ancient Bactriana, and so to Affghanistan and to Hindostan\r\non the east, or to Persia on the west. But if, instead, they continued\r\ntheir westward course, then they would skirt the north coast of the Aral\r\nand the Caspian, cross the Volga, and there would have a second\r\nopportunity, if they chose to avail themselves of it, of descending\r\nsouthwards, by Georgia and Armenia, either to Syria or to Asia Minor.\r\nRefusing this diversion, and persevering onwards to the west, at length\r\nthey would pass the Don, and descend upon Europe across the Ukraine,\r\nBessarabia, and the Danube.\r\n\r\nSuch are the three routes,--across the Oxus, across the Caucasus, and\r\nacross the Danube,--which the pastoral nations have variously pursued\r\nat various times, when their roving habits, their warlike propensities,\r\nand their discomforts at home, have combined to precipitate them on the\r\nindustry, the civilization, and the luxury of the West and of the South.\r\nAnd at such times, as might be inferred from what has been already said,\r\ntheir invasions have been rather irruptions, inroads, or, what are\r\ncalled, raids, than a proper conquest and occupation of the countries\r\nwhich have been their victims. They would go forward, 200,000 of them at\r\nonce, at the rate of 100 miles a day, swimming the rivers, galloping\r\nover the plains, intoxicated with the excitement of air and speed, as if\r\nit were a fox-chase, or full of pride and fury at the reverses which set\r\nthem in motion; seeking indeed their fortunes, but seeking them on no\r\nplan; like a flight of locusts, or a swarm of angry wasps smoked out of\r\ntheir nest. They would seek for immediate gratification, and let the\r\nfuture take its course. They would be bloodthirsty and rapacious, and\r\nwould inflict ruin and misery to any extent; and they would do tenfold\r\nmore harm to the invaded, than benefit to themselves. They would be\r\npowerful to break down; helpless to build up. They would in a day undo\r\nthe labour and skill, the prosperity of years; but they would not know\r\nhow to construct a polity, how to conduct a government, how to organize\r\na system of slavery, or to digest a code of laws. Rather they would\r\ndespise the sciences of politics, law, and finance; and, if they\r\nhonoured any profession or vocation, it would be such as bore\r\nimmediately and personally on themselves. Thus we find them treating the\r\npriest and the physician with respect, when they found such among their\r\ncaptives; but they could not endure the presence of a lawyer. How could\r\nit be otherwise with those who may be called the outlaws of the human\r\nrace? They did but justify the seeming paradox of the traveller's\r\nexclamation, who, when at length, after a dreary passage through the\r\nwilderness, he came in sight of a gibbet, returned thanks that he had\r\nnow arrived at a civilized country. \"The pastoral tribes,\" says the\r\nwriter I have already quoted, \"who were ignorant of the distinction of\r\nlanded property, must have disregarded the use, as well as the abuse, of\r\ncivil jurisprudence; and the skill of an eloquent lawyer would excite\r\nonly their contempt or their abhorrence.\" And he refers to an outrage on\r\nthe part of a barbarian of the North, who, not satisfied with cutting\r\nout a lawyer's tongue, sewed up his mouth, in order, as he said, that\r\nthe viper might no longer hiss. The well-known story of the Czar Peter,\r\nhimself a Tartar, is here in point. When told there were some thousands\r\nof lawyers at Westminster, he is said to have observed that there had\r\nbeen only two in his own dominions, and he had hung one of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.\r\n\r\nNow I have thrown the various inhabitants of the Asiatic plain together,\r\nunder one description, not as if I overlooked, or undervalued, the\r\ndistinction of races, but because I have no intention of committing\r\nmyself to any statements on so intricate and interminable a subject as\r\nethnology. In spite of the controversy about skulls, and skins, and\r\nlanguages, by means of which man is to be traced up to his primitive\r\ncondition, I consider place and climate to be a sufficiently real aspect\r\nunder which he may be regarded, and with this I shall content myself. I\r\nam speaking of the inhabitants of those extended plains, whether\r\nScythians, Massagetæ, Sarmatians, Huns, Moguls, Tartars, Turks, or\r\nanything else; and whether or no any of them or all of them are\r\nidentical with each other in their pedigree and antiquities. Position\r\nand climate create habits; and, since the country is called Tartary, I\r\nshall call them Tartar habits, and the populations which have inhabited\r\nit and exhibited them, Tartars, for convenience-sake, whatever be their\r\nfamily descent. From the circumstances of their situation, these\r\npopulations have in all ages been shepherds, mounted on horseback,\r\nroaming through trackless spaces, easily incited to war, easily formed\r\ninto masses, easily dissolved again into their component parts, suddenly\r\nsweeping across continents, suddenly descending on the south or west,\r\nsuddenly extinguishing the civilization of ages, suddenly forming\r\nempires, suddenly vanishing, no one knows how, into their native north.\r\n\r\nSuch is the fearful provision for havoc and devastation, when the Divine\r\nWord goes forth for judgment upon the civilized world, which the North\r\nhas ever had in store; and the regions on which it has principally\r\nexpended its fury, are those, whose fatal beauty, or richness of soil,\r\nor perfection of cultivation, or exquisiteness of produce, or amenity of\r\nclimate, makes them objects of desire to the barbarian. Such are China,\r\nHindostan, Persia, Syria, and Anatolia or the Levant, in Asia; Greece,\r\nItaly, Sicily, and Spain, in Europe; and the northern coast of Africa.\r\n\r\nThese regions, on the contrary, have neither the inducement nor the\r\nmeans to retaliate upon their ferocious invaders. The relative position\r\nof the combatants must always be the same, while the combat lasts. The\r\nSouth has nothing to win, the North nothing to lose; the North nothing\r\nto offer, the South nothing to covet. Nor is this all: the North, as in\r\nan impregnable fortress, defies the attack of the South. Immense\r\ntrackless solitudes; no cities, no tillage, no roads; deserts, forests,\r\nmarshes; bleak table-lands, snowy mountains; unlocated, flitting,\r\nreceding populations; no capitals, or marts, or strong places, or\r\nfruitful vales, to hold as hostages for submission; fearful winters and\r\nmany months of them;--nature herself fights and conquers for the\r\nbarbarian. What madness shall tempt the South to undergo extreme risks\r\nwithout the prospect or chance of a return? True it is, ambition, whose\r\nvery life is a fever, has now and then ventured on the reckless\r\nexpedition; but from the first page of history to the last, from Cyrus\r\nto Napoleon, what has the Northern war done for the greatest warriors\r\nbut destroy the flower of their armies and the _prestige_ of their name?\r\nOur maps, in placing the North at the top, and the South at the bottom\r\nof the sheet, impress us, by what may seem a sophistical analogy, with\r\nthe imagination that Huns or Moguls, Kalmucks or Cossacks, have been a\r\nsuperincumbent mass, descending by a sort of gravitation upon the fair\r\nterritories which lie below them. Yet this is substantially\r\ntrue;--though the attraction towards the South is of a moral, not of a\r\nphysical nature, yet an attraction there is, and a huge conglomeration\r\nof destructive elements hangs over us, and from time to time rushes down\r\nwith an awful irresistible momentum. Barbarism is ever impending over\r\nthe civilized world. Never, since history began, has there been so long\r\na cessation of this law of human society, as in the period in which we\r\nlive. The descent of the Turks on Europe was the last instance of it,\r\nand that was completed four hundred years ago. They are now themselves\r\nin the position of those races, whom they themselves formerly came down\r\nupon.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.\r\n\r\nAs to the instances of this conflict between North and South in the\r\ntimes before the Christian era, we know more of them from antiquarian\r\nresearch than from history. The principal of those which ancient writers\r\nhave recorded are contained in the history of the Persian Empire. The\r\nwandering Tartar tribes went at that time by the name of Scythians, and\r\nhad possession of the plains of Europe as well as of Asia. Central\r\nEurope was not at that time the seat of civilized nations; but from the\r\nChinese Sea even to the Rhine or Bay of Biscay, a course of many\r\nthousand miles, the barbarian emigrant might wander on, as necessity or\r\ncaprice impelled him. Darius assailed the Scythians of Europe; Cyrus,\r\nhis predecessor, the Scythians of Asia.\r\n\r\nAs to Cyrus, writers are not concordant on the subject; but the\r\ncelebrated Greek historian, Herodotus, whose accuracy of research is\r\ngenerally confessed, makes the great desert, which had already been\r\nfatal, according to some accounts, to the Assyrian Semiramis, the ruin\r\nalso of the founder of the Persian Empire. He tells us that Cyrus led an\r\narmy against the Scythian tribes (Massagetæ, as they were called), who\r\nwere stationed to the east of the Caspian; and that they, on finding him\r\nprepared to cross the river which bounded their country to the South,\r\nsent him a message which well illustrates the hopelessness of going to\r\nwar with them. They are said to have given him his choice of fighting\r\nthem either three days' march within their own territory, or three days'\r\nmarch within his; it being the same to them whether he made himself a\r\ngrave in their inhospitable deserts, or they a home in his flourishing\r\nprovinces. He had with him in his army a celebrated captive, the Lydian\r\nKing Croesus, who had once been head of a wealthy empire, till he had\r\nsuccumbed to the fortunes of a more illustrious conqueror; and on this\r\noccasion he availed himself of his advice. Croesus cautioned him\r\nagainst admitting the barbarians within the Persian border, and\r\ncounselled him to accept their permission of his advancing into their\r\nterritory, and then to have recourse to stratagem. \"As I hear,\" he says\r\nin the simple style of the historian, which will not bear translation,\r\n\"the Massagetæ have no experience of the good things of life. Spare not\r\nthen to serve up many sheep, and add thereunto stoups of neat wine, and\r\nall sorts of viands. Set out this banquet for them in our camp, leave\r\nthe refuse of the army there, and retreat with the body of your troops\r\nupon the river. If I am not mistaken, the Scythians will address\r\nthemselves to all this good cheer, as soon as they fall in with it, and\r\nthen we shall have the opportunity of a brilliant exploit.\" I need not\r\npursue the history further than to state the issue. In spite of the\r\nimmediate success of his _ruse de guerre_, Cyrus was eventually\r\ndefeated, and lost both his army and his life. The Scythian Queen\r\nTomyris, in revenge for the lives which he had sacrificed to his\r\nambition, is related to have cut off his head and plunged it into a\r\nvessel filled with blood, saying, \"Cyrus, drink your fill.\" Such is the\r\naccount given us by Herodotus; and, even if it is to be rejected, it\r\nserves to illustrate the difficulties of an invasion of Scythia; for\r\nlegends must be framed according to the circumstances of the case, and\r\ngrow out of probabilities, if they are to gain credit, and if they have\r\nactually succeeded in gaining it.\r\n\r\n\r\n7.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of the expedition of Darius in the next generation, is\r\nmore certain. This fortunate monarch, after many successes, even on the\r\nEuropean side of the Bosphorus, impelled by that ambition, which holy\r\nDaniel had already seen in prophecy to threaten West and North as well\r\nas South, towards the end of his life directed his arms against the\r\nScythians who inhabited the country now called the Ukraine. His pretext\r\nfor this expedition was an incursion which the same barbarians had made\r\ninto Asia, shortly before the time of Cyrus. They had crossed the Don,\r\njust above the sea of Azoff, had entered the country now called\r\nCircassia, had threaded the defiles of the Caucasus, and had defeated\r\nthe Median King Cyaxares, the grandfather of Cyrus. Then they overran\r\nArmenia, Cappadocia, Pontus, and part of Lydia, that is, a great portion\r\nof Anatolia or Asia Minor; and managed to establish themselves in the\r\ncountry for twenty-eight years, living by plunder and exaction. In the\r\ncourse of this period, they descended into Syria, as far as to the very\r\nborders of Egypt. The Egyptians bought them off, and they turned back;\r\nhowever, they possessed themselves of a portion of Palestine, and gave\r\ntheir name to one town, Scythopolis, in the territory of Manasses. This\r\nwas in the last days of the Jewish monarchy, shortly before the\r\ncaptivity. At length Cyaxares got rid of them by treachery; he invited\r\nthe greater number of them to a banquet, intoxicated, and massacred\r\nthem. Nor was this the termination of the troubles, of which they were\r\nthe authors; and I mention the sequel, because both the office which\r\nthey undertook and their manner of discharging it, their insubordination\r\nand their cruelty, are an anticipation of some passages in the early\r\nhistory of the Turks. The Median King had taken some of them into his\r\npay, made them his huntsmen, and submitted certain noble youths to\r\ntheir training. Justly or unjustly they happened one day to be punished\r\nfor leaving the royal table without its due supply of game: without more\r\nado, the savages in revenge murdered and served up one of these youths\r\ninstead of the venison which had been expected of them, and made\r\nforthwith for the neighbouring kingdom of Lydia. A war between the two\r\nstates was the consequence.\r\n\r\nBut to return to Darius:--it is said to have been in retaliation for\r\nthese excesses that he resolved on his expedition against the Scythians,\r\nwho, as I have mentioned, were in occupation of the district between the\r\nDanube and the Don. For this purpose he advanced from Susa in the\r\nneighbourhood of the Persian Gulf, through Assyria and Asia Minor to the\r\nBosphorus, just opposite to the present site of Constantinople, where he\r\ncrossed over into Europe. Thence he made his way, with the incredible\r\nnumber of 700,000 men, horse and foot, to the Danube, reducing Thrace,\r\nthe present Roumelia, in his way. When he had crossed that stream, he\r\nwas at once in Scythia; but the Scythians had adopted the same sort of\r\nstrategy, which in the beginning of this century was practised by their\r\nsuccessors against Napoleon. They cut and carried off the green crops,\r\nstopped up their wells or spoilt their water, and sent off their\r\nfamilies and flocks to places of safety. Then they stationed their\r\noutposts just a day's journey before the enemy, to entice him on. He\r\npursued them, they retreated; and at length he found himself on the Don,\r\nthe further boundary of the Scythian territory. They crossed the Don,\r\nand he crossed it too, into desolate and unknown wilds; then, eluding\r\nhim altogether, from their own knowledge of the country, they made a\r\ncircuit, and got back into their own land again.\r\n\r\nDarius found himself outwitted, and came to a halt; how he had\r\nvictualled his army, whatever deduction we make for its numbers, does\r\nnot appear; but it is plain that the time must come, when he could not\r\nproceed. He gave the order for retreat. Meanwhile, he found an\r\nopportunity of sending a message to the Scythian chief, and it was to\r\nthis effect:--\"Perverse man, take your choice; fight me or yield.\" The\r\nScythians intended to do neither, but contrived, as before, to harass\r\nthe Persian retreat. At length an answer came; not a message, but an\r\nominous gift; they sent Darius a bird, a mouse, a frog, and five arrows;\r\nwithout a word of explanation. Darius himself at first hailed it as an\r\nintimation of submission; in Greece to offer earth and water was the\r\nsign of capitulation, as, in a sale of land in our own country, a clod\r\nfrom the soil still passes, or passed lately, from seller to purchaser,\r\nas a symbol of the transfer of possession. The Persian king, then,\r\ndiscerned in these singular presents a similar surrender of territorial\r\njurisdiction. But another version, less favourable to his vanity and his\r\nhopes, was suggested by one of his courtiers, and it ran thus: \"Unless\r\nyou can fly like a bird, or burrow like a mouse, or swim the marshes\r\nlike a frog, you cannot escape our arrows.\" Whichever interpretation was\r\nthe true one, it needed no message from the enemy to inflict upon Darius\r\nthe presence of the dilemma suggested in this unpleasant interpretation.\r\nHe yielded to imperative necessity, and hastened his escape from the\r\nformidable situation in which he had placed himself, and through great\r\ngood fortune succeeded in effecting it. He crossed the sea just in time;\r\nfor the Scythians came down in pursuit, as far as the coast, and\r\nreturned home laden with booty.\r\n\r\nThis is pretty much all that is definitely recorded in history of the\r\nancient Tartars. Alexander, in a later age, came into conflict with them\r\nin the region called Sogdiana which lies at the foot of that high\r\nplateau of central and eastern Asia, which I have designated as their\r\nproper home. But he was too prudent to be entangled in extended\r\nexpeditions against them, and having made trial of their formidable\r\nstrength, and made some demonstrations of the superiority of his own, he\r\nleft them in possession of their wildernesses.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Isai. xli. 25: Jer. i. 14; vi. 1, 22; Joel ii. 20; etc., etc.\r\n\r\n[2] Gibbon.\r\n\r\n[3] Gibbon.\r\n\r\n[4] Caldecott's Baber.\r\n\r\n[5] Vid.

Indeed, this internal\r\ndiscord, which is the ordinary characteristic of races so barbarous, and\r\nthe frequent motive of their migrations, is the cause why in ancient\r\ntimes they were so little formidable to their southern neighbours; and\r\nit suggests a remark to the philosophical historian, Thucydides, which,\r\nviewed in the light of subsequent history, is almost prophetic. \"As to\r\nthe Scythians,\" he says, \"not only no European nation, but not even any\r\nAsiatic, would be able to measure itself with them, nation with nation,\r\nwere they but of one mind.\" Such was the safeguard of civilization in\r\nancient times; in modern unhappily it has disappeared. Not unfrequently,\r\nsince the Christian era, the powers of the North have been under one\r\nsovereign, sometimes even for a series of years; and have in consequence\r\nbeen brought into combined action against the South; nay, as time has\r\ngone on, they have been thrown into more and more formidable\r\ncombinations, with more and more disastrous consequences to its\r\nprosperity. Of these northern coalitions or Empires, there have been\r\nthree, nay five, which demand our especial attention both from their\r\nsize and their historical importance.\r\n\r\nThe first of these is the Empire of the Huns, under the sovereignty of\r\nAttila, at the termination of the Roman Empire; and it began and ended\r\nin himself. The second is in the time of the Crusades, when the Moguls\r\nspread themselves over Europe and Asia under Zingis Khan, whose power\r\ncontinued to the third generation, nay, for two centuries, in the\r\nnorthern parts of Europe. The third outbreak was under Timour or\r\nTamerlane, a century and more before the rise of Protestantism, when the\r\nMahometan Tartars, starting from the basin of the Aral and the fertile\r\nregion of the present Bukharia, swept over nearly the whole of Asia\r\nround about, and at length seated themselves in Delhi in Hindostan,\r\nwhere they remained in imperial power till they succumbed to the English\r\nin the last century. Then come the Turks, a multiform and reproductive\r\nrace, varied in its fortunes, complicated in its history, falling to\r\nrise again, receding here to expand there, and harassing and oppressing\r\nthe world for at least a long 800 years. And lastly comes the Russian\r\nEmpire, in which the Tartar element is prominent, whether in its pure\r\nblood or in the Slavonian approximation, and which comprises a\r\npopulation of many millions, gradually moulded into one in the course of\r\ncenturies, ever growing, never wavering, looking eagerly to the South\r\nand to an unfulfilled destiny, and possessing both the energy of\r\nbarbarism in its subjects and the subtlety of civilization in its\r\nrulers. The two former of these five empires were Pagan, the two next\r\nMahometan, the last Christian, but schismatic; all have been persecutors\r\nof the Church, or, at least, instruments of evil against her children.\r\nThe Russians I shall dismiss; the Turks, who form my proper subject, I\r\nshall postpone. First of all, I will take a brief survey of the three\r\nempires of the Tartars proper; of Attila and his Huns; of Zingis and his\r\nMoguls; and of Timour and his Mahometan Tartars.\r\n\r\nI have already waived the intricate question of race, as regards the\r\nvarious tribes who have roamed from time immemorial, or used to roam, in\r\nthe Asiatic and European wilderness, because it was not necessary to the\r\ndiscussion in which I am engaged. Their geographical position\r\nassimilated them to each other in their wildness, their love of\r\nwandering, their pastoral occupations, their predatory habits, their\r\nsecurity from attack, and the suddenness and the transitoriness of their\r\nconquests, even though they descend from our first parent by different\r\nlines. However, there is no need of any reserve or hesitation in\r\nspeaking of the three first empires into which the shepherds of the\r\nNorth developed, the Huns, the Moguls, and the Mahometan Tartars: they\r\nwere the creation of Tribes, whose identity of race is as certain as\r\ntheir community of country.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\nOf these the first in order is the Hunnish Empire of Attila, and if I\r\nspeak of it and of him with more of historical consecutiveness than of\r\nZingis or of Timour, it is because I think in him we see the pure\r\nundiluted Tartar, better than in the other two, and in his empire the\r\nbest specimen of a Tartar rule. Nothing brings before us more vividly\r\nthe terrible character of Attila than this, that he terrified the Goths\r\nthemselves. These celebrated barbarians at the time of Attila inhabited\r\nthe countries to the north of the Black Sea, between the Danube and the\r\nDon, the very district in which Darius so many centuries before found\r\nthe Scythians. They were impending over the Roman Empire, and\r\nthreatening it with destruction; their king was the great Hermanric,\r\nwho, after many victories, was closing his days in the fulness of power\r\nand renown. That they themselves, the formidable Goths, should have to\r\nfear and flee, seemed the most improbable of prospects; yet it was their\r\nlot. Suddenly they heard, or rather they felt before they heard,--so\r\nrapid is the torrent of Scythian warfare,--they felt upon them and among\r\nthem the resistless, crushing force of a remorseless foe. They beheld\r\ntheir fields and villages in flames about them, and their hearthstones\r\ndeluged in the blood of their dearest and their bravest. Shocked and\r\nstunned by so unexpected a calamity, they could think of nothing better\r\nthan turning their backs on the enemy, crowding to the Danube, and\r\nimploring the Romans to let them cross over, and to lodge themselves and\r\ntheir families in safety from the calamity which menaced them.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the very appearance of the enemy scared them; and they shrank\r\nfrom him, as children before some monstrous object. It is observed of\r\nthe Scythians, their ancestors, who, as I have mentioned, came down upon\r\nAsia in the Median times, that they were a frightful set of men. \"The\r\npersons of the Scythians,\" says a living historian,[7] \"naturally\r\nunsightly, were rendered hideous by indolent habits, only occasionally\r\ninterrupted by violent exertions; and the same cause subjected them to\r\ndisgusting diseases, in which they themselves revered the finger of\r\nHeaven.\" Some of these ancient tribes are said to have been cannibals,\r\nand their horrible outrage in serving up to Cyaxares human flesh for\r\ngame, may be taken to confirm the account Their sensuality was\r\nunbridled, so much so that even polygamy was a licence too limited for\r\ntheir depravity. The Huns were worthy sons of such fathers. The Goths,\r\nthe bravest and noblest of barbarians, recoiled in horror from their\r\nphysical and mental deformity. Their voices were shrill, their gestures\r\nuncouth, and their shapes scarcely human. They are said by a Gothic\r\nhistorian to have resembled brutes set up awkwardly on their hind legs,\r\nor to the misshapen figures (something like, I suppose, the grotesque\r\nforms of medieval sculpture), which were placed upon the bridges of\r\nantiquity. Their shoulders were broad, their noses flat, and their eyes\r\nblack, small, and deeply buried in their head. They had little hair on\r\ntheir skulls, and no beard. The report was spread and believed by the\r\nGoths, that they were not mere men, but the detestable progeny of evil\r\nspirits and witches in the wilds of the East.\r\n\r\nAs the Huns were but reproductions of the ancient Scythians, so are they\r\nreproduced themselves in various Tartar races of modern times.\r\nTavernier, the French traveller, in the seventeenth century, gives us a\r\nsimilar description of the Kalmuks, some of whom at present are included\r\nin the Russian Empire. \"They are robust men,\" he says,[8] \"but the most\r\nugly and deformed under heaven; a face so flat and broad, that from one\r\neye to the other is a space of five or six fingers. Their eyes are very\r\nsmall, the nose so flat that two small nostrils is the whole of it;\r\ntheir knees turned out, and their feet turned in.\"\r\n\r\nAttila himself did not degenerate in aspect from this unlovely race; for\r\nan historian tells us, whom I have already made use of, that \"his\r\nfeatures bore the stamp of his national origin; and the portrait of\r\nAttila exhibits the genuine deformity of a modern Calmuck; a large\r\nhead, a swarthy complexion, small deep-seated eyes, a flat nose, a few\r\nhairs in the place of a beard, broad shoulders, and a short square body,\r\nof nervous strength, though of a disproportioned form.\" I should add\r\nthat the Tartar eyes are not only far apart, but slant inwards, as do\r\nthe eyebrows, and are partly covered by the eyelid. Now Attila, this\r\nwriter continues, \"had a custom of rolling his eyes, as if he wished to\r\nenjoy the terror which he had inspired;\" yet, strange to say, all this\r\nwas so far from being thought a deformity by his people, that it even\r\nwent for something supernatural, for we presently read, \"the barbarian\r\nprinces confessed, that they could not presume to gaze, with a steady\r\neye, on the divine majesty of the King of the Huns.\"\r\n\r\nI consider Attila to have been a pure Hun; I do not suppose the later\r\nhordes under Zingis and Timour to have been so hideous, as being the\r\ndescendants of mixed marriages. Both Zingis himself and Timour had\r\nforeign mothers; as to the Turks, from even an earlier date than those\r\nconquerors, they had taken foreign captives to be mothers of their\r\nfamilies, and had lived among foreign people. Borrowing the blood of a\r\nhundred tribes as they went on, they slowly made their way, in the\r\ncourse of six or seven centuries, from Turkistan to Constantinople. Then\r\nas to the Russians again, only a portion of the empire is strictly\r\nTartar or Scythian; the greater portion is but Scythian in its first\r\norigin, many ages ago, and has long surrendered its wandering or nomad\r\nhabits, its indolence, and its brutality.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\nTo return to Attila:--this extraordinary man is the only conqueror of\r\nancient and modern times who has united in one empire the two mighty\r\nkingdoms of Eastern Scythia and Western Germany, that is, of that\r\nimmense expanse of plain, which stretches across Europe and Asia. If we\r\ndivide the inhabited portions of the globe into two parts, the land of\r\ncivilization and the land of barbarism, we may call him the supreme and\r\nsole king of the latter, of all those populations who did not live in\r\ncities, who did not till the soil, who were hunters and shepherds,\r\ndwelling in tents, in waggons, and on horseback.[9] Imagination can\r\nhardly take in the extent of his empire. In the West he interfered with\r\nthe Franks, and chastised the Burgundians, on the Rhine. On the East he\r\neven sent ambassadors to negotiate an equal alliance with the Chinese\r\nEmpire. The north of Asia was the home of his race, and on the north of\r\nEurope he ascended as high as Denmark and Sweden. It is said he could\r\nbring into the field an army of 500,000 or 700,000 men.\r\n\r\nYou will ask perhaps how he gained this immense power; did he inherit\r\nit? the Russian Empire is the slow growth of centuries; had Attila a\r\nlong line of royal ancestors, and was his empire, like that of Haroun,\r\nor Soliman, or Aurunzebe, the maturity and consummation of an eventful\r\nhistory? Nothing of the kind; it began, as it ended, with himself. The\r\nhistory of the Huns during the centuries immediately before him, will\r\nshow us how he came by it. It seems that, till shortly before the\r\nChristian era, the Huns had a vast empire, from a date unknown, in the\r\nportion of Tartary to the east of Mount Altai. It was against these\r\nformidable invaders that the Chinese built their famous wall, 1,500\r\nmiles in length, which still exists as one of the wonders of the world.\r\nIn spite of its protection, however, they were obliged to pay tribute to\r\ntheir fierce neighbours, until one of their emperors undertook a task\r\nwhich at first sight seems an exception to what I have already laid down\r\nas if a universal law in the history of northern warfare. This Chinese\r\nmonarch accomplished the bold design of advancing an army as much as 700\r\nmiles into the depths of the Tartar wilderness, and thereby at length\r\nsucceeded in breaking the power of the Huns. He succeeded;--but at the\r\nprice of 110,000 men. He entered Tartary with an army 140,000 strong; he\r\nreturned with 30,000.\r\n\r\nThe Huns, however, though broken, had no intention at all of being\r\nreduced. The wild warriors turned their faces westward, and not knowing\r\nwhither they were going, set out for Europe. This was at the end of the\r\nfirst century after Christ; in the course of the following centuries\r\nthey pursued the track which I have already marked out for the\r\nemigrating companies. They passed the lofty Altai; they gradually\r\ntravelled along the foot of the mountain-chain in which it is seated;\r\nthey arrived at the edge of the high table-land which bounds Tartary on\r\nthe west; then turning southward down the slopes which led to the low\r\nlevel of Turkistan, they found themselves close to a fertile region\r\nbetween the Jaxartes and the Oxus, the present Bukharia, then called\r\nSogdiana by the Greeks, afterwards the native land of Timour. Here was\r\nthe first of the three thoroughfares for a descent southwards, which I\r\nhave pointed out as open to the choice of adventurers. A portion of\r\nthese Huns, attracted by the rich pasture-land and general beauty of\r\nSogdiana, took up their abode there; the main body wandered on.\r\nPersevering in their original course, they skirted Siberia and the north\r\nof the Caspian, crossed the Volga, then the Don, and thus in the fifth\r\ncentury of the Christian era, as I just now mentioned, came upon the\r\nGoths, who were in undisturbed possession of the country. Now it would\r\nappear that, in this long march from the wall of China to the Danube,\r\nlasting as it did through some centuries, they lost hold of no part of\r\nthe tracts which they traversed. They remained on each successive\r\nencampment long enough (if I may so express myself) to sow themselves\r\nthere. They left behind them at least a remnant of their own population\r\nwhile they went forward, like a rocket thrown up in the sky, which,\r\nwhile it shoots forward, keeps possession of its track by its train of\r\nfire. And hence it was that Attila, when he found himself at length in\r\nHungary, and elevated to the headship of his people, became at once the\r\nacknowledged king of the vast territories and the untold populations\r\nwhich that people had been leaving behind them in its advance during the\r\nforegoing 350 years.\r\n\r\nSuch a power indeed had none of the elements of permanence in it, but it\r\nwas appalling at the moment, whenever there was a vigorous and\r\nunscrupulous hand to put it into motion. Such was Attila; it was his\r\nboast, that, where his horse once trod, there grass never grew again. As\r\nhe fulfilled his terrible destiny, religious men looked on with awe, and\r\ncalled him the \"Scourge of God.\" He burst as a thunder-cloud upon the\r\nwhole extent of country, now called Turkey in Europe, along a line of\r\nmore than five hundred miles from the Black Sea to the Gulf of Venice.\r\nHe defeated the Roman armies in three pitched battles, and then set\r\nabout destroying the cities of the Empire. Three of the greatest,\r\nConstantinople, Adrianople, and another, escaped: but as for the rest,\r\nthe barbarian fury fell on as many as seventy; they were sacked,\r\nlevelled to the ground, and their inhabitants carried off to captivity.\r\nNext he turned round to the West, and rode off with his savage horsemen\r\nto the Rhine. He entered France, and stormed and sacked the greater part\r\nof its cities. At Metz he involved in one promiscuous massacre priests\r\nand children; he burned the city, so that a solitary chapel of St.\r\nStephen was its sole remains. At length he was signally defeated by the\r\nRomans and Goths united at Chalons on the Marne, in a tremendous battle,\r\nwhich ended in 252,000, or, as one account says, 300,000 men being left\r\ndead on the field.\r\n\r\nIrritated rather than humbled, as some beast of prey, by this mishap, he\r\nturned to Italy. Crossing the Alps, he laid siege to Aquileia, at that\r\ntime one of the richest, most populous, and strongest of the cities on\r\nthe Hadriatic coast. He took it, sacked it, and so utterly destroyed it,\r\nthat the succeeding generation could scarcely trace its ruins. It is, we\r\nknow, no slight work, in toil and expense, even with all the appliances\r\nof modern science, to raze a single fortress; yet the energy of these\r\nwild warriors made sport of walled cities. He turned back, and passed\r\nalong through Lombardy; and, as he moved, he set fire to Padua and other\r\ncities; he plundered Vincenza, Verona, and Bergamo; and sold to the\r\ncitizens of Milan and Pavia their lives and buildings at the price of\r\nthe surrender of their property. There were a number of minute islands\r\nin the shallows of the extremity of the Hadriatic; and thither the\r\ntrembling inhabitants of the coast fled for refuge. Fish was for a time\r\ntheir sole food, and salt, extracted from the sea, their sole\r\npossession. Such was the origin of the city and the republic of Venice.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\nIt does not enter into my subject to tell you how this ferocious\r\nconqueror was stayed in the course of blood and fire which was carrying\r\nhim towards Rome, by the great St. Leo, the Pope of the day, who\r\nundertook an embassy to his camp. It was not the first embassy which the\r\nRomans had sent to him, and their former negotiations had been\r\nassociated with circumstances which could not favourably dispose the Hun\r\nto new overtures. It is melancholy to be obliged to confess that, on\r\nthat occasion, the contrast between barbarism and civilization had been\r\nto the advantage of the former. The Romans, who came to Attila to treat\r\nupon the terms of an accommodation, after various difficulties and some\r\ninsults, had found themselves at length in the Hunnish capital, in\r\nHungary, the sole city of an empire which extended for some thousand\r\nmiles. In the number of these ambassadors were some who were conducting\r\nan intrigue with Attila's own people for his assassination, and who\r\nactually had with them the imperial gold which was to be the price of\r\nthe crime. Attila was aware of the conspiracy, and showed his knowledge\r\nof it; but, from respect for the law of nations and of hospitality, he\r\nspared the guilty instruments or authors. Sad as it is to have to record\r\nsuch practices of an Imperial Court professedly Christian, still, it is\r\nnot unwelcome, for the honour of human nature, to discover in\r\nconsequence of them those vestiges of moral rectitude which the\r\ndegradation of ages had not obliterated from the Tartar character. It is\r\nwell known that when Homer, 1,500 years before, speaks of these\r\nbarbarians, he calls them, on the one hand, \"drinkers of mare's milk;\"\r\non the other, \"the most just of men.\" Truth, honesty, justice,\r\nhospitality, according to their view of things, are the historical\r\ncharacteristics, it must be granted, of Scythians, Tartars, and Turks,\r\ndown to this day; and Homer, perhaps, as other authors after him, was\r\nthe more struck with such virtues in these wild shepherds, in contrast\r\nwith the subtlety and perfidy, which, then as since, were the qualities\r\nof his own intellectually gifted countrymen.\r\n\r\nAttila, though aware of the treachery and of the traitor, had received\r\nthe Roman ambassadors, as a barbarian indeed, but as a king; and with\r\nthat strange mixture of rudeness and magnificence of which I shall have,\r\nas I proceed, to give more detailed specimens. As he entered the royal\r\nvillage or capital with his guests, a numerous troop of women came out\r\nto meet him, and marched in long files before him, chanting hymns in his\r\nhonour. As he passed the door of one of his favourite soldiers, the wife\r\nof the latter presented wine and meat for his refreshment. He did not\r\ndismount, but a silver table was raised for his accommodation by his\r\ndomestics, and then he continued his march. His palace, which was all of\r\nwood, was surrounded by a wooden wall, and contained separate houses for\r\neach of his numerous wives. The Romans were taken round to all of them\r\nto pay their respects; and they admired the singular quality and\r\nworkmanship of the wooden columns, which they found in the apartments of\r\nhis queen or state wife. She received them reclining on a soft couch,\r\nwith her ladies round her working at embroidery. Afterwards they had an\r\nopportunity of seeing his council; the supreme tribunal was held in the\r\ngate of the palace according to Oriental custom, perpetuated even to\r\nthis day in the title of the \"Ottoman Porte.\" They were invited to two\r\nsolemn banquets, in which Attila feasted with the princes and nobles of\r\nScythia. The royal couch and table were covered with carpets and fine\r\nlinen. The swords, and even the shoes of the nobles, were studded with\r\ngold and precious stones; the tables were profusely spread with gold\r\nand silver plates, goblets, and vases. Two bards stood before the King's\r\ncouch, and sung of his victories. Wine was drunk in great excess; and\r\nbuffoons, Scythian and Moorish, exhibited their unseemly dances before\r\nthe revellers. When the Romans were to depart, Attila discovered to them\r\nhis knowledge of the treachery which had been carried on against him.\r\n\r\nSuch were some of the untoward circumstances under which the great\r\nPontiff I have mentioned undertook a new embassy to the King of the\r\nHuns. He was not, we may well conceive, to be a spectator of their\r\nbarbaric festivities, or to be a listener to their licentious\r\ninterludes; he was rather an object to be gazed upon, than to gaze; and\r\nin truth there was that about him, in the noble aspect and the spare\r\nyouthful form, which portraits give to Pope Leo, which was adapted to\r\narrest and subdue even Attila. Attila had seen many great men in his\r\nday; he had seen the majesty of the Cæsars, and the eagles of their\r\nlegions; he had never seen before a Vicar of Christ. The place of their\r\ninterview has been ascertained by antiquarians;[10] it is near the great\r\nAustrian fortress of Peschiera, where the Mincio enters the Lago di\r\nGarda, close to the farm of Virgil. It is said he saw behind the Pontiff\r\nthe two Apostles St. Peter and St. Paul, as they are represented in the\r\npicture of Raffaelle; he was subdued by the influence of religion, and\r\nagreed to evacuate Italy.\r\n\r\nA few words will bring us to the end of his career. Evil has its limit;\r\nthe Scourge of God had accomplished His mission. Hardly had St. Leo\r\nretired, when the barbarian king availed himself of the brief interval\r\nin his work of blood, to celebrate a new marriage. In the deep\r\ncorruption of the Tartar race, polygamy is comparatively a point of\r\nvirtue: Attila's wives were beyond computation. Zingis, after him, had\r\nas many as five hundred; another of the Tartar leaders, whose name I\r\nforget, had three hundred. Attila, on the evening of his new nuptials,\r\ndrank to excess, and was carried to his room. There he was found in the\r\nmorning, bathed and suffocated in his blood. An artery had suddenly\r\nburst; and, as he lay on his back, the blood had flowed back upon his\r\nthroat and lungs, and so he had gone to his place.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.\r\n\r\nAnd now for Zingis and Timour:--like the Huns, they and their tribes\r\ncame down from the North of Asia, swept over the face of the South,\r\nobliterated the civilization of centuries, inflicted unspeakable misery\r\non whole nations, and then were spent, extinguished, and only survived\r\nto posterity in the desolation they caused. As Attila ruled from China\r\nto the Rhine, and wasted Europe from the Black Sea to the Loire, so\r\nZingis and his sons and grandsons occupied a still larger portion of the\r\nworld's surface, and exercised a still more pitiless sway. Besides the\r\nimmense range of territory, from Germany to the North Pacific Ocean,\r\nthroughout which their power was felt, even if it was not acknowledged,\r\nthey overran China, Siberia, Russia, Poland, Hungary, Anatolia, Syria,\r\nand Persia. During the sixty-five years of their dominion, they subdued\r\nalmost all Asia and a large portion of Europe. The conquests of Timour\r\nwere as sudden and as complete, if not as vast, as those of Zingis; and,\r\nif he did not penetrate into Europe, he accomplished instead the\r\nsubjugation of Hindostan.\r\n\r\nThe exploits of those warriors have the air of Eastern romance; 700,000\r\nmen marched under the standard of Zingis; and in one of his battles he\r\nleft 160,000 of his enemies upon the field. Before Timour died, he had\r\nhad twenty-seven crowns upon his head. When he invaded Turkistan, his\r\narmy stretched along a line of thirteen miles. We may conceive his\r\nenergy and determination, when we are told that, for five months, he\r\nmarched through wildernesses, subsisting his immense army on the\r\nfortunes of the chase. In his invasion of Hindostan he had to pass over\r\na high chain of mountains, and, in one stage of the passage, had to be\r\nlowered by ropes on a scaffold, down a precipice of 150 cubits in depth.\r\nHe attempted the operation five times before he got safely to the\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nThese two extraordinary men rivalled or exceeded Attila in their\r\nwholesale barbarities. Attila vaunted that the grass never grew again\r\nafter his horse's hoof; so it was the boast of Zingis, that when he\r\ndestroyed a city, he did it so completely, that his horse could gallop\r\nacross its site without stumbling. He depopulated the whole country from\r\nthe Danube to the Baltic in a season; and the ruins of cities and\r\nchurches were strewed with the bones of the inhabitants. He allured the\r\nfugitives from the woods, where they lay hid, under a promise of pardon\r\nand peace; he made them gather in the harvest and the vintage, and then\r\nhe put them to death. At Gran, in Hungary, he had 300 noble ladies\r\nslaughtered in his presence. But these were slight excesses compared\r\nwith other of his acts. When he had subdued the northern part of China,\r\nhe proposed, not in the heat of victory, but deliberately in council, to\r\nexterminate all its inhabitants, and to turn it into a cattle-walk; from\r\nthis project indeed he was diverted, but a similar process was his rule\r\nwith the cities he conquered. Let it be understood, he came down upon\r\ncities living in peace and prosperity, as the cities of England now,\r\nwhich had done him no harm, which had not resisted him, which submitted\r\nto him at discretion on his summons. What was his treatment of such? He\r\nordered out the whole population on some adjacent plain; then he\r\nproceeded to sack their city. Next he divided them into three parts:\r\nfirst, the soldiers and others capable of bearing arms; these he either\r\nenlisted into his armies, or slaughtered on the spot. The second class\r\nconsisted of the rich, the women, and the artizans;--these he divided\r\namongst his followers. The remainder, the old, infirm, and poor, he\r\nsuffered to return to their rifled city. Such was his ordinary course;\r\nbut when anything occurred to provoke him, the most savage excesses\r\nfollowed. The slightest offence, or appearance of offence, on the part\r\nof an individual, sufficed for the massacre of whole populations. The\r\nthree great capitals of Khorasan were destroyed by his orders, and a\r\nreckoning made of the slain; at Maru were killed 1,300,000; at Herat,\r\n1,600,000; and at Neisabour, 1,747,000; making a total of 4,647,000\r\ndeaths. Say these numbers are exaggerated fourfold or tenfold; even on\r\nthe last supposition you will have a massacre of towards half a million\r\nof helpless beings. After recounting such preternatural crimes, it is\r\nlittle to add, that his devastation of the fine countries between the\r\nCaspian and the Indus, a tract of many hundred miles, was so complete,\r\nthat six centuries have been unable to repair the ravages of four years.\r\n\r\nTimour equalled Zingis, if he could not surpass him, in barbarity. At\r\nDelhi, the capital of his future dynasty, he massacred 100,000\r\nprisoners, because some of them were seen to smile when the army of\r\ntheir countrymen came in sight. He laid a tax of the following sort on\r\nthe people of Ispahan, viz, to find him 70,000 human skulls, to build\r\nhis towers with; and, after Bagdad had revolted, he exacted of the\r\ninhabitants as many as 90,000. He burned, or sacked, or razed to the\r\nground, the cities of Astrachan, Carisme, Delhi, Ispahan, Bagdad,\r\nAleppo, Damascus, Broussa, Smyrna, and a thousand others. We seem to be\r\nreading of some antediluvian giant, rather than of a medieval conqueror.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.\r\n\r\nThe terrible races which I have been describing, like those giants of\r\nold, have ever been enemies of God and persecutors of His Church. Celts,\r\nGoths, Lombards, Franks, have been converted, and their descendants to\r\nthis day are Christian; but, whether we consider Huns, Moguls, or Turks,\r\nup to this time they are in the outer darkness. And accordingly, to the\r\ninnumerable Tartar tribes, and to none other, have been applied by\r\ncommentators the solemn passages about Gog and Magog, who are to fight\r\nthe battles of Antichrist against the faithful. \"Satan shall go forth\r\nand seduce the nations which are at the four corners of the earth, Gog\r\nand Magog, and shall collect them to battle, whose number is as the sea\r\nsand.\" From time to time the Holy See has fulfilled its apostolic\r\nmission of sending preachers to them, but without success. The only\r\nmissionaries who have had any influence upon them have been those of the\r\nNestorian heresy, who have in certain districts made the same sort of\r\nimpression on them which the Greek schism has made upon the Russians.\r\nSt. Louis too sent a friar to them on an embassy, when he wished to\r\npersuade them to turn their strength upon the Turks, with whom he was at\r\nwar; other European monarchs afterwards followed his pattern; and\r\nsometimes European merchants visited them for the purposes of trade.\r\nHowever little influence as these various visitants, in the course of\r\nseveral centuries, had upon their minds, they have at least done us the\r\nservice of giving us information concerning their habits and manners;\r\nand this so fully corroborates the historical account of them which I\r\nhave been giving, that it will be worth while laying before you some\r\nspecimens of it here.\r\n\r\nI have said that some of these travellers were laymen travelling for\r\ngain or in secular splendour, and others were humble servants of\r\nreligion. The contrast of their respective adventures is striking. The\r\ncelebrated Marco Polo, who was one of a company of enterprising Venetian\r\nmerchants, lived many years in Tartary in honour, and returned laden\r\nwith riches; the poor friars met with hardships in plenty, and nothing\r\nbesides. Not that the Poli were not good Catholics, not that they went\r\nout without a blessing from the Pope, or without friars of the order of\r\nSt. Dominic of his selection; but so it was, that the Tartars understood\r\nthe merchant well enough, but could not comprehend, could not set a\r\nvalue on the friar.\r\n\r\nWhen the Pope's missionaries came in sight of the Tartar encampment on\r\nthe northern frontier of Persia, they at once announced their mission\r\nand its object. It was from the Vicar of Christ upon earth, and the\r\nspiritual head of Christendom; and it was a simple exhortation addressed\r\nto the fierce conquerors before whom they stood, to repent and believe.\r\nThe answer of the Tartars was equally prompt and equally intelligible.\r\nWhen they had fully mastered the business of their visitors, they\r\nsentenced them to immediate execution; and did but hesitate about the\r\nmode. They were to be flayed alive, their skins filled with hay, and so\r\nsent back to the Pope; or they were to be put in the first rank in the\r\nnext battle with the Franks, and to die by the weapons of their own\r\ncountrymen. Eventually one of the Khan's wives begged them off. They\r\nwere kept in a sort of captivity for three years, and at length thought\r\nthemselves happy to be sent away with their lives. So much for the\r\nfriars; how different was the lot of the merchants may be understood by\r\nthe scene which took place on their return to Venice, It is said that,\r\non their arrival at their own city, after the absence of a quarter of a\r\ncentury, their change of appearance and poorness of apparel were such\r\nthat even their nearest friends did not know them. Having with\r\ndifficulty effected an entrance into their own house, they set about\r\ngiving a splendid entertainment to the principal persons of the city.\r\nThe banquet over, following the Oriental custom, they successively put\r\non and then put off again, and distributed to their attendants, a series\r\nof magnificent dresses; and at length they entered the room in the same\r\nweather-stained and shabby dresses, in which, as travellers, they had\r\nmade their first appearance at Venice. The assembled company eyed them\r\nwith wonder; which you may be sure was not diminished, when they began\r\nto unrip the linings and the patches of those old clothes, and as the\r\nseams were opened, poured out before them a prodigious quantity of\r\njewels. This had been their expedient for conveying their gains to\r\nEurope, and the effect of the discovery upon the world may be\r\nanticipated. Persons of all ranks and ages crowded to them, as the\r\nreport spread, and they were the wonder of their day.[11]\r\n\r\n\r\n7.\r\n\r\nSavage cruelty, brutal gluttony, and barbarous magnificence, are the\r\nthree principal ethical characteristics of a Tartar prince, as we may\r\ngather from what has come down to us in history, whether concerning the\r\nScythians or the Huns. The first of these three qualities has also been\r\nillustrated, from the references which I have been making to the history\r\nof Zingis and Timour, so that I think we have heard enough of it,\r\nwithout further instances from the report of these travellers, whether\r\necclesiastical or lay. I will but mention one corroboration of a\r\nbarbarity, which at first hearing it is difficult to credit. When the\r\nSpanish ambassador, then, was on his way to Timour, and had got as far\r\nas the north of Persia, he there actually saw a specimen of that sort of\r\npoll-tax, which I just now mentioned. It was a structure consisting of\r\nfour towers, composed of human skulls, a layer of mud and of skulls\r\nbeing placed alternately; and he tells us that upwards of 60,000 men\r\nwere massacred to afford materials for this building. Indeed it seems a\r\ndemonstration of revenge familiar to the Tartar race. Selim, the Ottoman\r\nSultan, reared a similar pyramid on the banks of the Nile.[12]\r\n\r\nTo return to our Spanish traveller. He proceeded to his destination,\r\nwhich was Samarcand, the royal city of Timour, in Sogdiana, the present\r\nBukharia, and was presented to the great conqueror. He describes the\r\ngate of the palace as lofty, and richly ornamented with gold and azure;\r\nin the inner court were six elephants, with wooden castles on their\r\nbacks, and streamers which performed gambols for the amusement of the\r\ncourtiers. He was led into a spacious room, where were some boys,\r\nTimour's grandsons, and these carried the King of Spain's letters to the\r\nKhan. He then was ushered into Timour's presence, who was seated, like\r\nAttila's queen, on a sort of cushioned sofa, with a fountain playing\r\nbefore him. He was at that time an old man, and his eyesight was\r\nimpaired.\r\n\r\nAt the entertainment which followed, the meat was introduced in leathern\r\nbags, so large as to be dragged along with difficulty. When opened,\r\npieces were cut out and placed on dishes of gold, silver, or porcelain.\r\nOne of the most esteemed, says the ambassador, was the hind quarter of a\r\nhorse; I must add what I find related, in spite of its offending our\r\nears:--our informant tells us that horse-tripe also was one of the\r\ndelicacies at table. No dish was removed, but the servants of the guests\r\nwere expected to carry off the remains, so that our ambassador doubtless\r\nhad his larder provided with the sort of viands I have mentioned for\r\nsome time to come. The drink was the famous Tartar beverage which we\r\nhear of so often, mares' milk, sweetened with sugar, or perhaps rather\r\nthe _koumiss_ or spirit which is distilled from it. It was handed round\r\nin gold and silver cups.\r\n\r\nNothing is more strange about the Tartars than the attachment they have\r\nshown to such coarse fare, from the earliest times till now. Timour, at\r\nwhose royal table this most odious banquet was served, was lord of all\r\nAsia, and had the command of every refinement not only of luxury, but of\r\ngluttony. Yet he is faithful to the food which regaled the old Scythians\r\nin the heroic age of Greece, and which is prized by the Usbek of the\r\npresent day. As Homer, in the beginning of the historic era, calls the\r\nScythians \"mares'-milk drinkers,\" so geographers of the present day\r\ndescribe their mode of distilling it in Russia. Tavernier speaks of it\r\ntwo centuries ago; the European visitors partook of it in the middle\r\nages; and the Roman ambassadors, in the later times of the Empire. These\r\ntribes have had the command of the vine, yet they seem to have scorned\r\nor even abhorred its use; and we have a curious account in Herodotus, of\r\na Scythian king who lost his life for presuming to take part secretly in\r\nthe orgies of Bacchus. Yet it was not that they did not intoxicate\r\nthemselves freely with the distillation which they had chosen; and even\r\nwhen they tolerated wine, they still adhered to their _koumiss_. That\r\nbeverage is described by the Franciscan, who was sent by St. Louis, as\r\nwhat he calls biting, and leaving a taste like almond milk on the\r\npalate; though Elphinstone, on the contrary writing in this century,\r\nsays \"it is of a whitish colour and a sourish taste.\" And so of\r\nhorse-flesh; I believe it is still put out for sale in the Chinese\r\nmarkets; Lieutenant Wood, in his journey to the source of the Oxus,\r\nspeaks of it among the Usbeks as an expensive food. So does Elphinstone,\r\nadding that in consequence the Usbeks are \"obliged to be content with\r\nbeef.\" Pinkerton tells us that it is made into dried hams; but this\r\nseems to be a refinement, for we hear a great deal from various authors\r\nof its being eaten more than half raw. After all, horse-flesh was the\r\nmost delicate of the Tartar viands in the times we are now considering.\r\nWe are told that, in spite of their gold and silver, and jewels, they\r\nwere content to eat dogs, foxes, and wolves; and, as I have observed\r\nbefore, the flesh of animals which had died of disease.\r\n\r\nBut again we have lost sight of the ambassador of Spain. After this\r\nbanquet, he was taken about by Timour to other palaces, each more\r\nmagnificent than the one preceding it. He speaks of the magnificent\r\nhalls, painted with various colours, of the hangings of silk, of gold\r\nand silver embroidery, of tables of solid gold, and of the rubies and\r\nother precious stones. The most magnificent of these entertainments was\r\non a plain; 20,000 pavilions being pitched around Timour's, which\r\ndisplayed the most gorgeous variety of colours. Two entertainments were\r\ngiven by the ladies of the court, in which the state queens of Timour,\r\nnine in number, sat in a row, and here pages handed round wine, not\r\n_koumiss_, in golden cups, which they were not slow in emptying.\r\n\r\nThe good friar, who went from St. Louis to the princes of the house of\r\nZingis, several centuries earlier, gives us a similar account. When he\r\nwas presented to the Khan, he went with a Bible and a Psalter in his\r\nhand; on entering the royal apartment, he found a curtain of felt spread\r\nacross the room; it was lifted up, and discovered the great man at table\r\nwith his wives about him, and prepared for drinking _koumiss_. The court\r\nknew something of Christianity from the Nestorians, who were about it,\r\nand the friar was asked to say a blessing on the meal; so he entered\r\nsinging the Salve Regina. On another occasion he was present at the\r\nbaptism of a wife of the Khan by a Nestorian priest. After the ceremony,\r\nshe called for a cup of liquor, desired a blessing from the officiating\r\nminister, and drank it off. Then she drank off another, and then\r\nanother; and continued this process till she could drink no more, and\r\nwas put into her carriage, and taken home. At another entertainment the\r\nfriar had to make a speech, in the name of the holy king he represented,\r\nto pray for health and long life to the Khan. When he looked round for\r\nhis interpreter, he found him in a state of intoxication, and in no\r\ncondition to be of service; then he directed his gaze upon the Khan\r\nhimself, and found him intoxicated also.\r\n\r\nI have made much mention of the wealth of the Tartars, from Attila to\r\nTimour; their foreign conquests would yield to them of course whatever\r\nof costly material their pride might require; but their native territory\r\nitself was rich in minerals. Altai in the north yielded the precious\r\nmetals; the range of mountains which branches westward from the Himalaya\r\non the south yielded them rubies and lapis lazuli. We are informed by\r\nthe travellers whom I have been citing that they dressed in winter in\r\ncostly furs; in summer in silk, and even in cloth of gold.[13] One of\r\nthe Franciscans speaks of the gifts received by the Khan from foreign\r\npowers. They were more than could be numbered;--satin cloths, robes of\r\npurple, silk girdles wrought with gold, costly skins. We are told of an\r\numbrella enriched with precious stones; of a train of camels covered\r\nwith cloth of Bagdad; of a tent of glowing purple; of five hundred\r\nwaggons full of silver, gold, and silk stuffs.\r\n\r\n\r\n8.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that the three great conquerors, who have been our\r\nsubject, all died in the fulness of glory. From the beginning of history\r\nto our own times, the insecurity of great prosperity has been the theme\r\nof poets and philosophers. Scripture points out to our warning in\r\nopposite ways the fortunes of Sennacherib, Nabuchodonosor, and\r\nAntiochus. Profane history tells us of Solon, the Athenian sage, coming\r\nto the court of Croesus, the prosperous King of Lydia, whom in his\r\nfallen state I have already had occasion to mention; and, when he had\r\nseen his treasures and was asked by the exulting monarch who was the\r\nhappiest of men, making answer that no one could be called happy before\r\nhis death. And we may call to mind in confirmation the history of\r\nCyrus, of Hannibal, of Mithridates, of Belisarius, of Bajazet, of\r\nNapoleon. But these Tartars finished a prosperous course without\r\nreverse; they died indeed and went to judgment, but, as far as the\r\nvisible scene of their glory is concerned, they underwent no change.\r\nAttila was summoned suddenly, but the summons found him a triumphant\r\nking; and the case is the same with Zingis and Timour. These latter\r\nconquerors had glories besides of a different kind which increased the\r\nlustre of their rule. They were both lawgivers; it is the boast of\r\nZingis that he laid down the principle of religious toleration with a\r\nclearness which modern philsophers have considered to rival the theory\r\nof Locke; and Timour, also established an efficient police in his\r\ndominions, and was a patron of literature. Their sun went down full and\r\ncloudless, with the merit of having shed some rays of blessing upon the\r\nearth, scorching and withering as had been its day. It is remarkable\r\nalso that all three had something of a misgiving, or softening of mind,\r\nmiserably unsatisfactory as it was, shortly before their deaths.\r\nAttila's quailing before the eye of the Vicar of Christ, and turning\r\naway from Italy, I have already spoken of. As to Zingis, as, laden at\r\nonce with years and with the spoils of Asia, he reluctantly measured his\r\nway home at the impatient bidding of his veterans, who were tired of\r\nwar, he seemed visited by a sense of the vanity of all things and a\r\nterror for the evil he had done. He showed some sort of pity for the\r\nvanquished, and declared his intention of rebuilding the cities he had\r\ndestroyed. Alas! it is ever easier to pull down than to build up. His\r\nwars continued; he was successful by his lieutenants when he could not\r\ngo to battle himself; he left his power to his children and\r\ngrandchildren, and he died.\r\n\r\n\r\n9.\r\n\r\nSuch was the end of Zingis, a pagan, who had some notion of Christianity\r\nin a corrupted form, and who once almost gave hopes of becoming a\r\nChristian, but who really had adopted a sort of indifference towards\r\nreligious creeds altogether. Timour was a zealous Mahometan, and had\r\nbeen instructed in more definite notions of moral duty. He too felt some\r\nmisgivings about his past course towards the end of his life; and the\r\ngroans and shrieks of the dying and the captured in the sack of Aleppo\r\nawoke for a while the stern monitor within him. He protested to the\r\ncadhi his innocence of the blood which he had shed. \"You see me here,\"\r\nhe said, \"a poor, lame, decrepit mortal; yet by my arm it has pleased\r\nthe Almighty to subdue the kingdoms of Iran, Touran, and Hindostan. I am\r\nnot a man of blood; I call God to witness, that never, in all my wars,\r\nhave I been the aggressor, but that my enemies have ever been the\r\nauthors of the calamities which have come upon them.\"[14]\r\n\r\nThis was the feeling of a mind sated with conquest, sated with glory,\r\naware at length that he must go further and look deeper, if he was to\r\nfind that on which the soul could really feed and live, and startled to\r\nfind the entrance to that abode of true greatness and of glory sternly\r\nshut against him. He looked towards the home of his youth, and the seat\r\nof his long prosperity, across the Oxus, to Sogdiana, to Samarcand, its\r\nsplendid capital, with its rich groves and smiling pastures, and there\r\nthe old man went to die. Not that he directly thought of death; for\r\nstill he yearned after military success: and he went thither for but a\r\nshort repose, between his stupendous victories in Asia Minor and a\r\nprojected campaign in China. But Samarcand was a fitting halt in that\r\nlong march; and there for the last time he displayed the glory of his\r\nkingdom, receiving the petitions or appeals of his subjects,\r\nostentatiously judging between the deserving and the guilty, inspecting\r\nplans for the erection of palaces and temples, and giving audience to\r\nambassadors from Russia, Spain, Egypt, and Hindostan. An English\r\nhistorian, whom I have already used, has enlarged upon this closing\r\nscene, and I here abridge his account of it. \"The marriage of six of the\r\nEmperor's grandsons,\" he says, \"was esteemed an act of religion as well\r\nas of paternal tenderness; and the pomp of the ancient caliphs was\r\nrevived in their nuptials. They were celebrated in the garden of\r\nCanighul, where innumerable tents and pavilions displayed the luxury of\r\na great city and the spoils of a victorious camp. Whole forests were cut\r\ndown to supply fuel for the kitchens; the plain was spread with pyramids\r\nof meat and vases of every liquor, to which thousands of guests were\r\ncourteously invited. The orders of the state and the nations of the\r\nearth were marshalled at the royal banquet. The public joy was testified\r\nby illuminations and masquerades; the trades of Samarcand passed in\r\nreview; and every trade was emulous to execute some quaint device, some\r\nmarvellous pageant, with the materials of their peculiar art. After the\r\nmarriage contracts had been ratified by the cadhies, nine times,\r\naccording to the Asiatic fashion, were the bridegrooms and their brides\r\ndressed and undressed; and at each change of apparel, pearls and rubies\r\nwere showered on their heads, and contemptuously abandoned to their\r\nattendants.\"\r\n\r\nYou may recollect the passage in Milton's Paradise Lost, which has a\r\nreference to the Oriental ceremony here described. It is in his account\r\nof Satan's throne in Pandemonium. \"High on a throne,\" the poet says,\r\n\r\n  \"High on a throne of royal state, which far\r\n  Outshone the wealth of Ormus or of Ind,\r\n  Or where the gorgeous East, with richest hand,\r\n  Showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold,\r\n  Satan exulting sat, by merit raised\r\n  To that bad eminence.\"\r\n\r\nSo it is; the greatest magnificence of this world is but a poor\r\nimitation of the flaming throne of the author of evil. But let us return\r\nto the history:--\"A general indulgence was proclaimed, and every law was\r\nrelaxed, every pleasure was allowed; the people were free, the sovereign\r\nwas idle; and the historian of Timour may remark, that after devoting\r\nfifty years to the attainment of empire, the only happy period of his\r\nlife was the two months in which he ceased to exercise his power. But he\r\nwas soon awakened to the cares of government and war. The standard was\r\nunfurled for the invasion of China; the emirs made the report of\r\n200,000, the select and veteran soldiers of Iran and Touran; the baggage\r\nand provisions were transported by 500 great waggons, and an immense\r\ntrain of horses and camels; and the troops might prepare for a long\r\nabsence, since more than six months were employed in the tranquil\r\njourney of a caravan from Samarcand to Pekin. Neither age, nor the\r\nseverity of winter, could retard the impatience of Timour; he mounted on\r\nhorseback, passed the Sihun\" (or Jaxartes) \"on the ice, marched 300\r\nmiles from his capital, and pitched his last camp at Otrar, where he was\r\nexpected by the angel of death. Fatigue and the indiscreet use of iced\r\nwater accelerated the progress of his fever; and the conqueror of Asia\r\nexpired in the seventieth year of his age; his designs were lost; his\r\narmies were disbanded; China was saved.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut the wonderful course of human affairs rolled on. Timour's death was\r\nfollowed at no long interval by the rise of John Basilowich in Russia,\r\nwho succeeded in throwing of the Mogul yoke, and laid the foundation of\r\nthe present mighty empire. The Tartar sovereignty passed from Samarcand\r\nto Moscow.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] Thirlwall: Greece, vol. ii. p. 196.\r\n\r\n[8] Voyages, t. i. p. 456.\r\n\r\n[9] Gibbon.\r\n\r\n[10] Maffei Verona, part ii. p. 6.\r\n\r\n[11] Murray's Asia.\r\n\r\n[12] Thornton's Turkey.

When\r\nthey first appear in history they are Huns or Tartars, and nothing else;\r\nthey are indeed in no unimportant respects Tartars even now; but, had\r\nthey never been made something more than Tartars, they never would have\r\nhad much to do with the history of the world. In that case, they would\r\nhave had only the fortunes of Attila and Zingis; they might have swept\r\nover the face of the earth, and scourged the human race, powerful to\r\ndestroy, helpless to construct, and in consequence ephemeral; but this\r\nwould have been all. But this has not been all, as regards the Turks;\r\nfor, in spite of their intimate resemblance or relationship to the\r\nTartar tribes, in spite of their essential barbarism to this day, still\r\nthey, or at least great portions of the race, have been put under\r\neducation; they have been submitted to a slow course of change, with a\r\nlong history and a profitable discipline and fortunes of a peculiar\r\nkind; and thus they have gained those qualities of mind, which alone\r\nenable a nation to wield and to consolidate imperial power.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\nI have said that, when first they distinctly appear on the scene of\r\nhistory, they are indistinguishable from Tartars. Mount Altai, the high\r\nmetropolis of Tartary, is surrounded by a hilly district, rich not only\r\nin the useful, but in the precious metals. Gold is said to abound there;\r\nbut it is still more fertile in veins of iron, which indeed is said to\r\nbe the most plentiful in the world. There have been iron works there\r\nfrom time immemorial, and at the time that the Huns descended on the\r\nRoman Empire (in the fifth century of the Christian era), we find the\r\nTurks nothing more than a family of slaves, employed as workers of the\r\nore and as blacksmiths by the dominant tribe. Suddenly in the course of\r\nfifty years, soon after the fall of the Hunnish power in Europe, with\r\nthe sudden development peculiar to Tartars, we find these Turks spread\r\nfrom East to West, and lords of a territory so extensive, that they were\r\nconnected, by relations of peace or war, at once with the Chinese, the\r\nPersians, and the Romans. They had reached Kamtchatka on the North, the\r\nCaspian on the West, and perhaps even the mouth of the Indus on the\r\nSouth. Here then we have an intermediate empire of Tartars, placed\r\nbetween the eras of Attila and Zingis; but in this sketch it has no\r\nplace, except as belonging to Turkish history, because it was contained\r\nwithin the limits of Asia, and, though it lasted for 200 years, it only\r\nfaintly affected the political transactions of Europe. However, it was\r\nnot without some sort of influence on Christendom, for the Romans\r\ninterchanged embassies with its sovereign in the reign of the then\r\nGreek Emperor Justin the younger (A.D. 570), with the view of engaging\r\nhim in a warlike alliance against Persia. The account of one of these\r\nembassies remains, and the picture it presents of the Turks is\r\nimportant, because it seems clearly to identify them with the Tartar\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nFor instance, in the mission to the Tartars from the Pope, which I have\r\nalready spoken of, the friars were led between two fires, when they\r\napproached the Khan, and they at first refused to follow, thinking they\r\nmight be countenancing some magical rite. Now we find it recorded of\r\nthis Roman embassy, that, on its arrival, it was purified by the Turks\r\nwith fire and incense. As to incense, which seems out of place among\r\nsuch barbarians, it is remarkable that it is used in the ceremonial of\r\nthe Turkish court to this day. At least Sir Charles Fellows, in his work\r\non the Antiquities of Asia Minor, in 1838, speaks of the Sultan as going\r\nto the festival of Bairam with incense-bearers before him. Again, when\r\nthe Romans were presented to the great Khan, they found him in his tent,\r\nseated on a throne, to which wheels were attached and horses attachable,\r\nin other words, a Tartar waggon. Moreover, they were entertained at a\r\nbanquet which lasted the greater part of the day; and an intoxicating\r\nliquor, not wine, which was sweet and pleasant, was freely presented to\r\nthem; evidently the Tartar _koumiss_.[15] The next day they had a second\r\nentertainment in a still more splendid tent; the hangings were of\r\nembroidered silk, and the throne, the cups, and the vases were of gold.\r\nOn the third day, the pavilion, in which they were received, was\r\nsupported on gilt columns; a couch of massive gold was raised on four\r\ngold peacocks; and before the entrance to the tent was what might be\r\ncalled a sideboard, only that it was a sort of barricade of waggons,\r\nladen with dishes, basins, and statues of solid silver. All these points\r\nin the description,--the silk hangings, the gold vessels, the\r\nsuccessively increasing splendour of the entertainments,--remind us of\r\nthe courts of Zingis and Timour, 700 and 900 years afterwards.\r\n\r\nThis empire, then, of the Turks was of a Tartar character; yet it was\r\nthe first step of their passing from barbarism to that degree of\r\ncivilization which is their historical badge. And it was their first\r\nstep in civilization, not so much by what it did in its day, as (unless\r\nit be a paradox to say so), by its coming to an end. Indeed it so\r\nhappens, that those Turkish tribes which have changed their original\r\ncharacter and have a place in the history of the world, have obtained\r\ntheir _status_ and their qualifications for it, by a process very\r\ndifferent from that which took place in the nations most familiar to us.\r\nWhat this process has been I will say presently; first, however, let us\r\nobserve that, fortunately for our purpose, we have still specimens\r\nexisting of those other Turkish tribes, which were never submitted to\r\nthis process of education and change, and, in looking at them as they\r\nnow exist, we see at this very day the Turkish nationality in something\r\nvery like its original form, and are able to decide for ourselves on its\r\nclose approximation to the Tartar. You may recollect I pointed out to\r\nyou, Gentlemen, in the opening of these lectures, the course which the\r\npastoral tribes, or nomads as they are often called, must necessarily\r\ntake in their emigrations. They were forced along in one direction till\r\nthey emerged from their mountain valleys, and descended their high\r\nplateau at the end of Tartary, and then they had the opportunity of\r\nturning south. If they did not avail themselves of this opening, but\r\nwent on still westward, their next southern pass would be the defiles of\r\nthe Caucasus and Circassia, to the west of the Caspian. If they did not\r\nuse this, they would skirt the top of the Black Sea, and so reach\r\nEurope. Thus in the emigration of the Huns from China, you may recollect\r\na tribe of them turned to the South as soon as they could, and settled\r\nthemselves between the high Tartar land and the sea of Aral, while the\r\nmain body went on to the furthest West by the north of the Black Sea.\r\nNow with this last passage into Europe we are not here concerned, for\r\nthe Turks have never introduced themselves to Europe by means of it;[16]\r\nbut with those two southward passages which are Asiatic, viz., that to\r\nthe east of the Aral, and that to the west of the Caspian. The Turkish\r\ntribes have all descended upon the civilized world by one or other of\r\nthese two roads; and I observe, that those which have descended along\r\nthe east of the Aral have changed their social habits and gained\r\npolitical power, while those which descended to the west of the Caspian\r\nremain pretty much what they ever were. The former of these go among us\r\nby the general name of Turks; the latter are the Turcomans or Turkmans.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\nNow, first, I shall briefly mention the Turcomans, and dismiss them,\r\nbecause, when they have once illustrated the original state of their\r\nrace, they have no place in this sketch. I have said, then, that the\r\nancient Turco-Tartar empire, to which the Romans sent their embassy in\r\nthe sixth century, extended to the Caspian and towards the Indus. It was\r\nin the beginning of the next century that the Romans, that is, the\r\nGreco-Romans of Constantinople, found them in the former of these\r\nneighbourhoods; and they made the same use of them in the defence of\r\ntheir territory, to which they had put the Goths before the overthrow of\r\nthe Western Empire. It was a most eventful era at which they addressed\r\nthemselves to these Turks of the Caspian. It was almost the very year of\r\nthe Hegira, which marks the rise of the Mahometan imposture and rule. As\r\nyet, however, the Persians were in power, and formidable enemies to the\r\nRomans, and at this very time in possession of the Holy Cross, which\r\nChosroes, their powerful king, had carried away from Jerusalem twelve\r\nyears before. But the successful Emperor Heraclius was already in the\r\nfull tide of those brilliant victories, which in the course of a few\r\nyears recovered it; and, to recall him from their own soil, the Persians\r\nhad allied themselves with the barbarous tribes of Europe, (the\r\nRussians, Sclavonians, Bulgarians, and others,) which, then as now, were\r\npressing down close upon Constantinople from the north. This alliance\r\nsuggested to Heraclius the counterstroke of allying himself with the\r\nTurkish freebooters, who in like manner, as stationed above the Caspian,\r\nwere impending over Persia. Accordingly the horde of Chozars, as this\r\nTurkish tribe was called, at the Emperor's invitation, transported their\r\ntents from the plains of the Volga through the defiles of the Caucasus\r\ninto Georgia. Heraclius showed them extraordinary attention; he put his\r\nown diadem on the head of the barbarian prince, and distributed gold,\r\njewels, and silk to his officers; and, on the other hand, he obtained\r\nfrom them an immediate succour of 40,000 horse, and the promise of an\r\nirruption of their brethren into Persia from the far East, from the\r\nquarter of the Sea of Aral, which I have pointed out as the first of\r\nthe passages by which the shepherds of Tartary came down upon the South.\r\nSuch were the allies, with which Heraclius succeeded in utterly\r\noverthrowing and breaking up the Persian power; and thus, strange to\r\nsay, the greatest of all the enemies of the Church among the nations of\r\nthe earth, the Turk, began his career in Christian history by\r\ncoöperating with a Christian Emperor in the recovery of the Holy Cross,\r\nof which a pagan, the ally of Russia, had got possession. The religious\r\naspect, however, of this first era of their history, seems to have\r\npassed away without improvement; what they gained was a temporal\r\nadvantage, a settlement in Georgia and its neighbourhood, which they\r\nhave held from that day to this.\r\n\r\nThis horde of Turks, the Chozars, was nomad and pagan; it consisted of\r\nmounted shepherds, surrounded with their flocks, living in tents and\r\nwaggons. In the course of the following centuries, under the shadow of\r\ntheir more civilized brethren, other similar hordes were introduced,\r\nnomad and pagan still; they might indeed happen sometimes to pass down\r\nfrom the east of the Caspian as well as from the west, hastening to the\r\nsouth straight from Turkistan along the coast of the Aral;--either road\r\nwould lead them down to the position which the Chozars were the first to\r\noccupy in Georgia and Armenia,--but still there would be but one step in\r\ntheir journey between their old native sheep-walk and horse-path and the\r\nfair region into which they came. It was a sudden Tartar descent,\r\naccompanied with no national change of habits, and promising no\r\npermanent stability. Nor would they have remained there, I suppose, as\r\nthey did remain, were it not that they have been protected, as they were\r\noriginally introduced, by neighbouring states which have made use of\r\nthem. There, however, in matter of fact, they remain to this day, the\r\nsuccessors of the Chozars, in Armenia, in Syria, in Asia Minor, even as\r\nfar west as the coast of the Archipelago and its maritime cities and\r\nports, being pretty much what they were a thousand years ago, except\r\nthat they have taken up the loose profession of Mahometanism, and have\r\ngiven up some of the extreme peculiarities of their Tartar state, such\r\nas their attachment to horse-flesh and mares' milk. These are the\r\nTurcomans.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\nThe writer in the Universal History divides them into eastern and\r\nwestern. Of the Eastern, with which we are not concerned, he tells us\r\nthat[17] \"they are tall and robust, with square flat faces, as well as\r\nthe western; only they are more swarthy, and have a greater resemblance\r\nto the Tartars. Some of them have betaken themselves to husbandry. They\r\nare all Mohammedans; they are very turbulent, very brave, and good\r\nhorsemen.\" And of the Western, that they once had two dynasties in the\r\nneighbourhood of Armenia, and were for a time very powerful, but that\r\nthey are now subjects of the Turks, who never have been able to subdue\r\ntheir roving habits; that they dwell in tents of thick felt, without\r\nfixed habitation; that they profess Mahomedanism, but perform its duties\r\nno better than their brethren in the East; that they are governed by\r\ntheir own chiefs according to their own laws; that they pay tribute to\r\nthe Ottoman Porte, and are bound to furnish it with horsemen; that they\r\nare great robbers, and are in perpetual warfare with their neighbours\r\nthe Kurds; that they march sometimes two or three hundred families\r\ntogether, and with their droves cover sometimes a space of two leagues,\r\nand that they prefer the use of the bow to that of firearms.\r\n\r\nThis account is drawn up from writers of the sixteenth and seventeenth\r\ncenturies. Precisely the same report of their habits is made by Dr.\r\nChandler in his travels in Asia Minor in the middle of the last century;\r\nhe fell in with them in his journey between Smyrna and Ephesus. \"We were\r\ntold here,\" he says, \"that the road farther on was beset with Turcomans,\r\na people supposed to be descended from the Nomades Scythæ: or Shepherd\r\nScythians; busied, as of old, in breeding and nurturing cattle, and\r\nleading, as then, an unsettled life; not forming villages and towns with\r\nstable habitations, but flitting from place to place, as the season and\r\ntheir convenience directs; choosing their stations, and overspreading\r\nwithout control the vast neglected pastures of this desert empire.... We\r\nset out, and ... soon after came to a wild country covered with\r\nthickets, and with the black booths of the Turcomans, spreading on every\r\nside, innumerable, with flocks and herds and horses and poultry feeding\r\nround them.\"[18]\r\n\r\nI may seem to be making unnecessary extracts, but I have two reasons for\r\nmultiplying them; in order, first, to show the identity in character of\r\nthe various tribes of the Tartar and the Turkish stock, and next, in\r\norder to impress upon your imagination what that character is; for it is\r\nnot easy to admit into the mind the very idea of a people of this kind,\r\ndwelling too, and that for ages, in some of the most celebrated and\r\nbeautiful regions of the world, such as Syria and Asia Minor. With this\r\nview I will read what Volney says of them, as he found them in Syria\r\ntowards the close of the last century. \"The Turkmans,\" he says,[19] \"are\r\nof the number of those Tartar hordes, who, in the great revolutions of\r\nthe Empire of the Caliphs, emigrated from the eastward of the Caspian\r\nSea, and spread themselves over the vast plains of Armenia and Asia\r\nMinor. Their language is the same as that of the Turks, and their mode\r\nof life nearly resembles that of the Bedouin Arabs. Like them, they are\r\nshepherds, and consequently obliged to travel over immense tracts of\r\nland to procure subsistence for their numerous herds.... Their whole\r\noccupation consists in smoking and looking after their flocks.\r\nPerpetually on horseback, with their lances on their shoulders, their\r\ncrooked sabres by their sides, and their pistols in their belts, they\r\nare expert horsemen and indefatigable soldiers.... A great number of\r\nthese tribes pass in the summer into Armenia and Caramania, where they\r\nfind grass in great abundance, and return to their former quarters in\r\nthe winter. The Turkmans are reputed to be Moslem ... but they trouble\r\nthemselves little about religion.\"\r\n\r\nWhile I was collecting these passages, a notice of these tribes appeared\r\nin the columns of the _Times_ newspaper, sent home by its Constantinople\r\ncorrespondent, apropos of the present concentration of troops in that\r\ncapital in expectation of a Russian war. His Statement enables us to\r\ncarry down our specimens of the Tartar type of the Turkish race to the\r\npresent day \"From the coast of the Black Sea,\" he writes home, \"to the\r\nTaurus chain of mountains, a great part of the population is nomad, and\r\nbesides the Turks or Osmanlis,\" that is, the Ottoman or Imperial Turks,\r\n\"consists of two distinct races;--the Turcomans, who possessed\r\nthemselves of the land before the advent of the Osmanlis, and who\r\nwander with their black tents up to the shores of the Bosphorus; and the\r\nCurds.\" With the Curds we are not here concerned. He proceeds: \"The\r\nTurcomans, who are spread over the whole of Asia Minor, are a most\r\nwarlike people. Clans, numbering many thousand, acknowledge the Sultan\r\nas the representative of the Caliphs and the Sovereign Lord of Islam,\r\nfrom whom all the Frank kings receive their crowns; but they are\r\npractically independent of him, and pay no taxes but to their own\r\nchiefs. In the neighbourhood of Cæsarea, Kusan Oghlou, a Turcoman chief,\r\nnumbers 20,000 armed horsemen, rules despotically over a large district,\r\nand has often successfully resisted the Sultan's arms. These people lead\r\na nomad life, are always engaged in petty warfare, are well mounted, and\r\narmed with pistol, scimitar, spear, or gun, and would always be useful\r\nas irregular troops.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\nAnd now I have said enough, and more than enough, of the original state\r\nof the Turkish race, as exhibited in the Chozars and Turcomans:--it is\r\ntime to pursue the history of that more important portion of it with\r\nwhich we are properly engaged, which received some sort of education,\r\nand has proved itself capable of social and political union. I observed\r\njust now, that that education was very different in its mode and\r\ncircumstances from that which has been the lot of the nations with which\r\nwe are best acquainted. Other nations have been civilized in their own\r\nhomes, and, by their social progress, have immortalized a country as\r\nwell as a race. They have been educated by their conquests, or by\r\nsubjugation, or by the intercourse with foreigners which commerce or\r\ncolonization has opened; but in every case they have been true to their\r\nfatherland, and are children of the soil. The Greeks sent out their\r\ncolonies to Asia Minor and Italy, and those colonies reacted upon the\r\nmother country. Magna Græcia and Ionia showed their mother country the\r\nway to her intellectual supremacy. The Romans spread gradually from one\r\ncentral city, and when their conquests reached as far as Greece, \"the\r\ncaptive,\" in the poet's words, \"captivated her wild conqueror, and\r\nintroduced arts into unmannered Latium.\"[20] England was converted by\r\nthe Roman See and conquered by the Normans, and was gradually civilized\r\nby the joint influences of religion and of chivalry. Religion indeed,\r\nthough a depraved religion, has had something to do, as we shall see,\r\nwith the civilization of the Turks; but the circumstances have been\r\naltogether different from those which we trace in the history of\r\nEngland, Rome, or Greece. The Turks present the spectacle of a race\r\npoured out, as it were, upon a foreign material, interpenetrating all\r\nits parts, yet preserving its individuality, and at length making its\r\nway through it, and reappearing, in substance the same as before, but\r\ncharged with the qualities of the material through which it has been\r\npassed, and modified by them. They have been invaded by no conqueror,\r\nthey have brought no captive arts or literature home, they have\r\nundergone no conversion in mass, they have been taught by no commerce,\r\nby no international relationship; but they have in the course of\r\ncenturies slowly soaked or trickled, if I may use the words, through the\r\nSaracenic populations with which they came in contact, and after being\r\nnationally lost to the world, as far as history goes, for long periods\r\nand through different countries, eventually they have come to the face\r\nof day with that degree of civilization which they at present possess,\r\nand at length have usurped a place within the limits of the great\r\nEuropean family. And this is why the path southwards to the east of the\r\nAral was, in matter of fact, the path of civilization, and that by the\r\nCaucasus the path of barbarism; this is why the Turks who took the\r\nformer course could found an empire, and those who took the latter have\r\nremained Tartars or Turcomans, as they were originally; because the way\r\nof the Caucasus was a sheer descent from Turkistan into the country\r\nwhich they occupy, but the way of the Aral was a circuitous course,\r\nleading them through many countries--through Sogdiana, Khorasan,\r\nZabulistan, and Persia,--with many fortunes, under many masters, for\r\nmany hundred years, before they came round to the region to which their\r\nTurcoman brethren attained so easily, but with so little eventual\r\nadvantage. My meaning will be clearer, as I proceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.\r\n\r\n1. First of all, we may say that the very region into which they came,\r\ntended to their civilization. Of course the peculiarities of soil,\r\nclimate, and country are not by themselves sufficient for a social\r\nchange, else the Turcomans would have the best right to civilization;\r\nyet, when other influences are present too, climate and country are far\r\nfrom being unimportant. You may recollect that I have spoken more than\r\nonce of the separation of a portion of the Huns from the main body, when\r\nthey were emigrating from Tartary into Europe, in the time of the\r\nGoths.[21] These turned off sharp to the South immediately on descending\r\nthe high table-land; and, crossing the Jaxartes, found themselves in a\r\nfertile and attractive country, between the Aral and their old country,\r\nwhere they settled. It is a peculiarity of Asia that its regions are\r\neither very hot or very cold. It has the highest mountains in the world,\r\nbleak table-lands, vast spaces of burning desert, tracts stretched out\r\nbeneath the tropical sun. Siberia goes for a proverb for cold: India is\r\na proverb for heat. It is not adequately supplied with rivers, and it\r\nhas little of inland sea. In these respects it stands in singular\r\ncontrast with Europe. If then the tribes which inhabit a cold country\r\nhave, generally speaking, more energy than those which are relaxed by\r\nthe heat, it follows that you will have in Asia two descriptions of\r\npeople brought together in extreme, sometimes in sudden, contrariety\r\nwith each other, the strong and the weak. Here then, as some\r\nphilosophers have argued,[22] you have the secret of the despotisms and\r\nthe vast empires of which Asia has been the seat; for it always\r\npossesses those who are naturally fitted to be tyrants, and those also\r\nwhose nature it is to tremble and obey. But we may take another, perhaps\r\na broader, view of the phenomenon. The sacred writer says: \"Give me\r\nneither riches nor beggary:\" and, as the extremes of abundance and of\r\nwant are prejudicial to our moral well-being, so they seem to be\r\nprejudicial to our intellectual nature also. Mental cultivation is best\r\ncarried on in temperate regions. In the north men are commonly too cold,\r\nin the south too hot, to think, read, write, and act. Science,\r\nliterature, and art refuse to germinate in the frost, and are burnt up\r\nby the sun.\r\n\r\nNow it so happened that the region in which this party of Huns settled\r\nthemselves was one of the fairest and most fruitful in Asia. It is\r\nbounded by deserts, it is in parts encroached on by deserts; but viewed\r\nin its length and breadth, in its produce and its position, it seems a\r\ncountry equal, or superior, to any which that vast continent, as at\r\npresent known, can show. Its lower portion is the extensive territory of\r\nKhorasan, the ancient Bactriana; going northwards across the Oxus, we\r\ncome into a spacious tract, stretching to the Aral and to the Jaxartes,\r\nand measuring a square of 600 miles. It was called in ancient times\r\nSogdiana; in the history of the middle ages Transoxiana, or \"beyond the\r\nOxus;\" by the Eastern writers Maver-ul-nere, or Mawer-al-nahar, which is\r\nsaid to have the same meaning; and it is now known by the name Bukharia.\r\nTo these may be added a third province, at the bottom of the Aral,\r\nbetween the mouth of the Oxus and the Caspian, called Kharasm. These,\r\nthen, were the regions in which the Huns in question took up their\r\nabode.\r\n\r\nThe two large countries I first mentioned are celebrated in all ages for\r\nthose characteristics which render a spot desirable for human\r\nhabitation. As to Sogdiana, or Maver-ul-nere, the region with which we\r\nare specially concerned, the Orientals, especially the Persians, of the\r\nmedieval period do not know how to express in fit terms their admiration\r\nof its climate and soil. They do not scruple to call it the Paradise of\r\nAsia. \"It may be considered,\" says a modern writer,[23] \"as almost the\r\nonly example of the finest temperate climate occurring in that\r\ncontinent, which presents generally an abrupt transition from burning\r\ntropical heat to the extreme cold of the north.\" According to an Arabian\r\nauthor, there are just three spots in the globe which surpass all the\r\nrest in beauty and fertility; one of them is near Damascus, another\r\nseems to be the valley of a river on the Persian Gulf, and the third is\r\nthe plain of Sogdiana. Another writer says: \"I have cast my eyes around\r\nBokhara, and never have I seen a verdure more fresh or of wider extent.\r\nThe green carpet mingles in the horizon with the azure of the sky.\"[24]\r\nAbulfeda in like manner calls it \"the most delightful of all places God\r\nhas created.\" Some recent writer, I think, speaks in disparagement of\r\nit.[25] And I can quite understand, that the deserts which must be\r\npassed to reach it from the south or the north may betray the weary\r\ntraveller into an exaggerated praise, which is the expression both of\r\nhis recruited spirits and of his gratitude. But all things are good only\r\nby comparison; and I do not see why an Asiatic, having experience of the\r\nsands which elsewhere overspread the face of his continent, should for\r\nthat reason be ill qualified to pronounce that Sogdiana affords a\r\ncontrast to them. Moreover, we have the experience of other lands, as\r\nAsia Minor, which have presented a very different aspect in different\r\nages. A river overflows and turns a fruitful plain into a marsh; or it\r\nfails, and turns it into a sandy desert. Sogdiana is watered by a number\r\nof great rivers, which make their way across it from the high land on\r\nits east to the Aral or Caspian. Now we read in history of several\r\ninstances of changes, accidental or artificial, in the direction or the\r\nsupply of these great water-courses. I think I have read somewhere, but\r\ncannot recover my authority, of some emigration of the inhabitants of\r\nthose countries, caused by a failure of the stream on which they\r\ndepended. And we know for certain that the Oxus has been changed in its\r\ncourse, accidentally or artificially, more than once. Disputes have\r\narisen before now between the Russian Government and the Tartars, on the\r\nsubject of one of these diversions of the bed of a river.[26] One\r\nprovince of Khorasan, which once was very fertile, is in consequence now\r\na desert It may be questioned, too, whether the sands of the adjacent\r\ndeserts, which are subject to violent agitation from the action of the\r\nwind, may not have encroached upon Sogdiana. Nor should it be overlooked\r\nthat this rich country has been subjected to the same calamities which\r\nhave been the desolation of Asia Minor; for, as the Turcomans have\r\ndevastated the latter, so, as I have already had occasion to mention,\r\nZingis swept round the sea of Aral, and destroyed the fruits of a long\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nEven after the ravages of that conqueror, however, Timour and the\r\nEmperor Baber, who had a right to judge of the comparative excellence of\r\nthe countries of the East, bear witness to the beauty of Sogdiana.\r\nTimour, who had fixed his imperial seat in Samarcand, boasted he had a\r\ngarden 120 miles in extent. Baber expatiates on the grain and fruit and\r\ngame of its northern parts; of the tulips, violets, and roses of another\r\nportion of it; of the streams and gardens of another. Its plains are\r\nsaid by travellers to abound in wood, its rivers in fish, its valleys in\r\nfruit-trees, in wheat and barley, and in cotton.[27] The quince,\r\npomegranate, fig, apricot, and almond all flourish in it. Its melons are\r\nthe finest in the world. Mulberries abound, and provide for a\r\nconsiderable manufacture of silk. No wine, says Baber, is equal to the\r\nwine of Bokhara. Its atmosphere is so clear and serene, that the stars\r\nare visible even to the verge of the horizon. A recent Russian traveller\r\nsays he came to a country so smiling, well cultivated, and thickly\r\npeopled, with fields, canals, avenues of trees, villages, and gardens,\r\nthat he thought himself in an enchanted country. He speaks in raptures\r\nof its melons, pomegranates, and grapes.[28] Its breed of horses is\r\ncelebrated; so much so that a late British traveller[29] visited the\r\ncountry with the special object of substituting it for the Arab in our\r\nIndian armies. Its mountains abound in useful and precious produce. Coal\r\nis found there; gold is collected from its rivers; silver and iron are\r\nyielded by its hills; we hear too of its mines of turquoise, and of its\r\ncliffs of lapis lazuli,[30] and its mines of rubies, which to this day\r\nare the object of the traveller's curiosity.[31] I might extend my\r\nremarks to the country south of the Oxus and of its mountain range, the\r\nmodern Affghanistan. Though Cabul is 6,000 feet above the level of the\r\nsea, it abounds in pomegranates, mulberries, apples, and fruit of every\r\nkind. Grapes are so plentiful, that for three months of the year they\r\nare given to the cattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.\r\n\r\nThis region, favoured in soil and climate, is favoured also in position.\r\nLying at the mouth of the two great roads of emigration from the far\r\nEast, the valleys of the Jaxartes and the Oxus, it is the natural mart\r\nbetween High Asia and Europe, receiving the merchandize of East and\r\nNorth, and transporting it by its rivers, by the Caspian, the Kur, and\r\nthe Phasis, to the Black Sea. Thus it received in former days the silk\r\nof China, the musk of Thibet, and the furs of Siberia, and shipped them\r\nfor the cities of the Roman Empire. To Samarcand, its metropolis, we owe\r\nthe art of transforming linen into paper, which the Sogdian merchants\r\nare said to have gained from China, and thence diffused by means of\r\ntheir own manufacturers over the western world. A people so\r\ncircumstanced could not be without civilization; but that civilization\r\nwas of a much earlier date. It must not be forgotten that the celebrated\r\nsage, Zoroaster, before the times of history, was a native, and, as some\r\nsay, king of Bactriana. Cyrus had established a city in the same region,\r\nwhich he called after his name. Alexander conquered both Bactriana and\r\nSogdiana, and planted Grecian cities there. There is a long line of\r\nGreco-Bactrian kings; and their coins and pateræ have been brought to\r\nlight within the last few years. Alexander's name is still famous in the\r\ncountry; not only does Marco Polo in the middle ages speak of his\r\ndescendants as still found there, but even within the last fifteen years\r\nSir Alexander Burns found a man professing that descent in the valley of\r\nthe Oxus, and Lieutenant Wood another in the same neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nNor was Greek occupation the only source of the civilization of\r\nSogdiana. Centuries rolled on, and at length the Saracens renewed, on\r\ntheir own peculiar basis, the mental cultivation which Sogdiana had\r\nreceived from Alexander. The cities of Bokhara and Samarcand have been\r\nfamous for science and literature. Bokhara was long celebrated as the\r\nmost eminent seat of Mahometan learning in central Asia; its colleges\r\nwere, and are, numerous, accommodating from 60 to 600 students each. One\r\nof them gained the notice and the pecuniary aid of the Russian Empress\r\nCatharine.[32] Samarcand rivals Bokhara in fame; its university even in\r\nthe last century was frequented by Mahometan youth from foreign\r\ncountries. There were more than 300 colleges for students, and there was\r\nan observatory, celebrated in the middle ages, the ruins of which\r\nremain. Here lies the body of Timour, under a lofty dome, the sides of\r\nwhich are enriched with agate. \"Since the time of the Holy Prophet,\"\r\nthat is, Mahomet, says the Emperor Baber, \"no country has produced so\r\nmany Imaums and eminent divines as Mawar-al-nahar,\" that is, Sogdiana.\r\nIt was celebrated for its populousness. At one time it boasted of being\r\nable to send out 300,000 foot, and as many horse, without missing them.\r\nBridges and caravansaries abounded; the latter, in the single province\r\nattached to its capital, amounted to 2,000. In Bactriana, the very ruins\r\nof Balkh extend for a circuit of 20 miles, and Sir A. Burns wound\r\nthrough three miles of them continuously.\r\n\r\nSuch is the country, seated at present between the British and the\r\nRussian Empires, and such as regards its previous and later state, which\r\nthe savage Huns, in their emigration from Tartary, had necessarily\r\nencountered; and it cannot surprise us that one of their many tribes had\r\nbeen persuaded to settle there, instead of seeking their fortunes\r\nfarther west. The effect upon these settlers in course of time was\r\nmarvellous. Though it was not of course the mere climate of Sogdiana\r\nthat changed them, still we cannot undervalue the influence which is\r\nnecessarily exerted on the mind by the idea of property, when once\r\nrecognised and accepted, by the desire of possession and by the love of\r\nhome, and by the sentiment of patriotism which arises in the mind,\r\nespecially with the occupation of a rich and beautiful country.\r\nMoreover, they became the guests or masters of a people, who, however\r\nrude, at least had far higher claims to be called civilized than they\r\nthemselves, and possessed among them the remains of a more civilized\r\nera. They found a race, too, not Tartar, more capable of civilization,\r\nmore gifted with intellect, and more comely in person. Settling down\r\namong the inhabitants, and intermarrying with them, in the course of\r\ngenerations their Tartar characteristics were sensibly softened. For a\r\nthousand years this restless people remained there, as if chained to the\r\nsoil. They still had the staple of barbarism in them, but so polished\r\nwere they for children of a Tartar stock, that they are called in\r\nhistory the White Huns of Sogdiana. They took to commerce, they took to\r\nliterature; and when, at the end of a few centuries, the Turks, as I\r\nhave already described, spread abroad from the iron works and forges of\r\nMount Altai to Kamtchatka, the Volga, and the Indus, and overran these\r\nWhite Huns in the course of their victories, they could find no parties\r\nmore fitted than them to act as their diplomatists and correspondents in\r\ntheir negotiations with the Romans.\r\n\r\nSuch was the influence of Sogdiana on the Huns; is it wonderful that it\r\nexerted some influence on the Turks, when they in turn got possession of\r\nit? History justifies the anticipation; as the Huns of the second or\r\nthird centuries settled around the Aral, so the Turks in the course of\r\nthe sixth or seventh centuries overran them, and descended down to the\r\nmodern Affghanistan and the Indus; and as the fair region and its\r\ninhabitants, which they crossed and occupied, had begun at the former\r\nera the civilization of the first race of Tartars, so did it at the\r\nlatter era begin the education of the second.\r\n\r\n\r\n7.\r\n\r\n2. But a more direct and effective instrument of social education was\r\naccorded to the Turks on their occupation of Sogdiana. You may recollect\r\nI spoke of their first empire as lasting for only 200 years,[33] about\r\n90 of which measures the period of that occupation. Their power then\r\ncame to an end; what was the consequence of their fall? were they driven\r\nout of Sogdiana again? were they massacred? did they take refuge in the\r\nmountains or deserts? were they reduced to slavery? Thus we are\r\nintroduced to a famous passage of history: the case was as follows:--At\r\nthe very date at which Heraclius called the Turcomans into Georgia, at\r\nthe very date when their Eastern brethren crossed the northern border of\r\nSogdiana, an event of most momentous import had occurred in the South. A\r\nnew religion had arisen in Arabia. The impostor Mahomet, announcing\r\nhimself the Prophet of God, was writing the pages of that book, and\r\nmoulding the faith of that people, which was to subdue half the known\r\nworld. The Turks passed the Jaxartes southward in A.D. 626; just four\r\nyears before Mahomet had assumed the royal dignity, and just six years\r\nafter, on his death, his followers began the conquest of the Persian\r\nEmpire. In the course of 20 years they effected it; Sogdiana was at its\r\nvery extremity, or its borderland; there the last king of Persia took\r\nrefuge from the south, while the Turks were pouring into it from the\r\nnorth. There was little to choose for the unfortunate prince between the\r\nTurk and the Saracen; the Turks were his hereditary foe; they had been\r\nthe giants and monsters of the popular poetry; but he threw himself into\r\ntheir arms. They engaged in his service, betrayed him, murdered him, and\r\nmeasured themselves with the Saracens in his stead. Thus the military\r\nstrength of the north and south of Asia, the Saracenic and the Turkish,\r\ncame into memorable conflict in the regions of which I have said so\r\nmuch. The struggle was a fierce one, and lasted many years; the Turks\r\nstriving to force their way down to the ocean, the Saracens to drive\r\nthem back into their Scythian deserts. They first fought this issue in\r\nBactriana or Khorasan; the Turks got the worst of the fight, and then\r\nit was thrown back upon Sogdiana itself, and there it ended again in\r\nfavour of the Saracens. At the end of 90 years from the time of the\r\nfirst Turkish descent on this fair region, they relinquished it to their\r\nMahometan opponents. The conquerors found it rich, populous, and\r\npowerful; its cities, Carisme, Bokhara, and Samarcand, were surrounded\r\nbeyond their fortifications by a suburb of fields and gardens, which was\r\nin turn protected by exterior works; its plains were well cultivated,\r\nand its commerce extended from China to Europe. Its riches were\r\nproportionally great; the Saracens were able to extort a tribute of two\r\nmillion gold pieces from the inhabitants; we read, moreover, of the\r\ncrown jewels of one of the Turkish princesses; and of the buskin of\r\nanother, which she dropt in her flight from Bokhara, as being worth two\r\nthousand pieces of gold.[34] Such had been the prosperity of the\r\nbarbarian invaders, such was its end; but not _their_ end, for adversity\r\ndid them service, as well as prosperity, as we shall see.\r\n\r\nIt is usual for historians to say, that the triumph of the South threw\r\nthe Turks back again upon their northern solitudes; and this might\r\neasily be the case with some of the many hordes, which were ever passing\r\nthe boundary and flocking down; but it is no just account of the\r\nhistorical fact, viewed as a whole. Not often indeed do the Oriental\r\nnations present us with an example of versatility of character; the\r\nTurks, for instance, of this day are substantially what they were four\r\ncenturies ago. We cannot conceive, were Turkey overrun by the Russians\r\nat the present moment, that the fanatical tribes, which are pouring into\r\nConstantinople from Asia Minor, would submit to the foreign yoke, take\r\nservice under their conquerors, become soldiers, custom-officers,\r\npolice, men of business, attachés, statesmen, working their way up from\r\nthe ranks and from the masses into influence and power; but, whether\r\nfrom skill in the Saracens, or from far-reaching sagacity in the Turks\r\n(and it is difficult to assign it to either cause), so it was, that a\r\nprocess of this nature followed close upon the Mahometan conquest of\r\nSogdiana. It is to be traced in detail to a variety of accidents. Many\r\nof the Turks probably were made slaves, and the service to which they\r\nwere subjected was no matter of choice. Numbers had got attached to the\r\nsoil; and inheriting the blood of Persians, White Huns, or aboriginal\r\ninhabitants for three generations, had simply unlearned the wildness of\r\nthe Tartar shepherd. Others fell victims to the religion of their\r\nconquerors, which ultimately, as we know, exercised a most remarkable\r\ninfluence upon them. Not all at once, but as tribe descended after\r\ntribe, and generation followed generation, they succumbed to the creed\r\nof Mahomet; and they embraced it with the ardour and enthusiasm which\r\nFranks and Saxons so gloriously and meritoriously manifested in their\r\nconversion to Christianity.\r\n\r\n\r\n8.\r\n\r\n3. Here again was a very powerful instrument in modification of their\r\nnational character. Let me illustrate it in one particular. If there is\r\none peculiarity above another, proper to the savage and to the Tartar,\r\nit is that of excitability and impetuosity on ordinary occasions; the\r\nTurks, on the other hand, are nationally remarkable for gravity and\r\nalmost apathy of demeanour. Now there are evidently elements in the\r\nMahometan creed, which would tend to change them from the one\r\ntemperament to the other. Its sternness, its coldness, its doctrine of\r\nfatalism; even the truths which it borrowed from Revelation, when\r\nseparated from the truths it rejected, its monotheism untempered by\r\nmediation, its severe view of the divine attributes, of the law, and of\r\na sure retribution to come, wrought both a gloom and also an improvement\r\nin the barbarian, not very unlike the effect which some forms of\r\nProtestantism produce among ourselves. But whatever was the mode of\r\noperation, certainly it is to their religion that this peculiarity of\r\nthe Turks is ascribed by competent judges. Lieutenant Wood in his\r\njournal gives us a lively account of a peculiarity of theirs, which he\r\nunhesitatingly attributes to Islamism. \"Nowhere,\" he says, \"is the\r\ndifference between European and Mahomedan society more strongly marked\r\nthan in the lower walks of life.... A Kasid, or messenger, for example,\r\nwill come into a public department, deliver his letters in full durbar,\r\nand demean himself throughout the interview with so much composure and\r\nself-possession, that an European can hardly believe that his grade in\r\nsociety is so low. After he has delivered his letters, he takes his seat\r\namong the crowd, and answers, calmly and without hesitation, all the\r\nquestions which may be addressed to him, or communicates the verbal\r\ninstructions with which he has been entrusted by his employer, and which\r\nare often of more importance than the letters themselves. Indeed, all\r\nthe inferior classes possess an innate self-respect, and a natural\r\ngravity of deportment, which differs as far from the suppleness of a\r\nHindustani as from the awkward rusticity of an English clown.\" ... \"Even\r\nchildren,\" he continues, \"in Mahomedan countries have an unusual degree\r\nof gravity in their deportment. The boy, who can but lisp his 'Peace be\r\nwith you,' has imbibed this portion of the national character. In\r\npassing through a village, these little men will place their hands upon\r\ntheir breasts, and give the usual greeting. Frequently have I seen the\r\nchildren of chiefs approach their father's durbar, and stopping short at\r\nthe threshold of the door, utter the shout of 'Salam Ali-Kum,' so as to\r\ndraw all eyes upon them; but nothing daunted, they marched boldly into\r\nthe room, and sliding down upon their knees, folded their arms and took\r\ntheir seat upon the musnad with all the gravity of grown-up persons.\"\r\n\r\nAs Islamism has changed the demeanour of the Turks, so doubtless it has\r\nin other ways materially innovated on their Tartar nature. It has given\r\nan aim to their military efforts, a political principle, and a social\r\nbond. It has laid them under a sense of responsibility, has moulded them\r\ninto consistency, and taught them a course of policy and perseverance in\r\nit. But to treat this part of the subject adequately to its importance\r\nwould require, Gentlemen, a research and a fulness of discussion\r\nunsuitable to the historical sketch which I have undertaken. I have said\r\nenough for my purpose upon this topic; and indeed on the general\r\nquestion of the modification of national character to which the Turks\r\nwere at this period subjected.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[15] Univ.

The Turks came into the pleasant plains and\r\nvalleys of Sogdiana; the Turcomans into the well-wooded mountains and\r\nsunny slopes of Asia Minor. The Turcomans were brought out of their\r\ndreary deserts, yet they retained their old habits, and they remain\r\nbarbarians to this day. But why? it must be borne in mind, they neither\r\nsubjugated the inhabitants of their new country on the one hand, nor\r\nwere subjugated by them on the other. They never had direct or intimate\r\nrelations with it; they were brought into it by the Roman Government at\r\nConstantinople as its auxiliaries, but they never naturalized themselves\r\nthere. They were like gipseys in England, except that they were mounted\r\nfreebooters instead of pilferers and fortune-tellers. It was far\r\notherwise with their brethren in Sogdiana; they were there first as\r\nconquerors, then as conquered. First they held it in possession as their\r\nprize for 90 or 100 years; they came into the usufruct and enjoyment of\r\nit. Next, their political ascendancy over it involved, as in the case of\r\nthe White Huns, some sort of moral surrender of themselves to it. What\r\nwas the first consequence of this? that, like the White Huns, they\r\nintermarried with the races they found there. We know the custom of the\r\nTartars and Turks; under such circumstances they would avail themselves\r\nof their national practice of polygamy to its full extent of licence. In\r\nthe course of twenty years a new generation would arise of a mixed race;\r\nand these in turn would marry into the native population, and at the end\r\nof ninety or a hundred years we should find the great-grandsons or the\r\ngreat-great-grandsons of the wild marauders who first crossed the\r\nJaxartes, so different from their ancestors in features both of mind and\r\nbody, that they hardly would be recognized as deserving the Tartar name.\r\nAt the end of that period their power came to an end, the Saracens\r\nbecame masters of them and of their country, but the process of\r\nemigration southward from the Scythian desert, which had never\r\nintermitted during the years of their domination, continued still,\r\nthough that domination was no more.\r\n\r\nHere it is necessary to have a clear idea of the nature of that\r\nassociation of the Turkish tribes from the Volga to the Eastern Sea, to\r\nwhich I have given the name of Empire:--it was not so much of a\r\npolitical as of a national character; it was the power, not of a system,\r\nbut of a race. They were not one well-organized state, but a number of\r\nindependent tribes, acting generally together, acknowledging one leader\r\nor not, according to circumstances, combining and coöperating from the\r\nidentity of object which acted on them, and often jealous of each other\r\nand quarrelling with each other on account of that very identity. Each\r\ntribe made its way down to the south as it could; one blocked up the way\r\nof the other for a time; there were stoppages and collisions, but there\r\nwas a continual movement and progress. Down they came one after another,\r\nlike wolves after their prey; and as the tribes which came first became\r\npartially civilized, and as a mixed generation arose, these would\r\nnaturally be desirous of keeping back their less polished uncles or\r\ncousins, if they could; and would do so successfully for awhile: but\r\ncupidity is stronger than conservatism; and so, in spite of delay and\r\ndifficulty, down they would keep coming, and down they did come, even\r\nafter and in spite of the overthrow of their Empire; crowding down as to\r\na new world, to get what they could, as adventurers, ready to turn to\r\nthe right or the left, prepared to struggle on anyhow, willing to be\r\nforced forward into countries farther still, careless what might turn\r\nup, so that they did but get down. And this was the process which went\r\non (whatever were their fortunes when they actually got down, prosperous\r\nor adverse) for 400, nay, I will say for 700 years. The storehouse of\r\nthe north was never exhausted; it sustained the never-ending run upon\r\nits resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\nI was just now referring to a change in the Turks, which I have\r\nmentioned before, and which had as important a bearing as any other of\r\ntheir changes upon their subsequent fortunes. It was a change in their\r\nphysiognomy and shape, so striking as to recommend them to their masters\r\nfor the purposes of war or of display. Instead of bearing any longer the\r\nhideous exterior which in the Huns frightened the Romans and Goths, they\r\nwere remarkable, even as early as the ninth century, when they had been\r\namong the natives of Sogdiana only two hundred years, for the beauty of\r\ntheir persons. An important political event was the result: hence the\r\nintroduction of the Turks into the heart of the Saracenic empire. By\r\nthis time the Caliphs had removed from Damascus to Bagdad; Persia was\r\nthe imperial province, and into Persia they were introduced for the\r\nreason I have mentioned, sometimes as slaves, sometimes as captives\r\ntaken in war, sometimes as mercenaries for the Saracenic armies: at\r\nlength they were enrolled as guards to the Caliph, and even appointed to\r\noffices in the palace, to the command of the forces, and to\r\ngovernorships in the provinces. The son of the celebrated Harun al\r\nRaschid had as many as 50,000 of these troops in Bagdad itself. And thus\r\nslowly and silently they made their way to the south, not with the pomp\r\nand pretence of conquest, but by means of that ordinary intercommunion\r\nwhich connected one portion of the empire of the Caliphs with another.\r\nIn this manner they were introduced even into Egypt.\r\n\r\nThis was their history for a hundred and fifty years, and what do we\r\nsuppose would be the result of this importation of barbarians into the\r\nheart of a flourishing empire? Would they be absorbed as slaves or\r\nsettlers in the mass of the population, or would they, like mercenaries\r\nelsewhere, be fatal to the power that introduced them? The answer is not\r\ndifficult, considering that their very introduction argued a want of\r\nenergy and resource in the rulers whom they served. To employ them was a\r\nconfession of weakness; the Saracenic power indeed was not very aged,\r\nbut the Turkish was much younger, and more vigorous;--then too must be\r\nconsidered the difference of national character between the Turks and\r\nthe Saracens. A writer of the beginning of the present century,[35]\r\ncompares the Turks to the Romans; such parallels are generally fanciful\r\nand fallacious; but, if we must accept it in the present instance, we\r\nmay complete the picture by likening the Saracens and Persians to the\r\nGreeks, and we know what was the result of the collision between Greece\r\nand Rome. The Persians were poets, the Saracens were philosophers. The\r\nmathematics, astronomy, and botany were especial subjects of the studies\r\nof the latter. Their observatories were celebrated, and they may be\r\nconsidered to have originated the science of chemistry. The Turks, on\r\nthe other hand, though they are said to have a literature, and though\r\ncertain of their princes have been patrons of letters, have never\r\ndistinguished themselves in exercises of pure intellect; but they have\r\nhad an energy of character, a pertinacity, a perseverance, and a\r\npolitical talent, in a word, they then had the qualities of mind\r\nnecessary for ruling, in far greater measure, than the people they were\r\nserving. The Saracens, like the Greeks, carried their arms over the\r\nsurface of the earth with an unrivalled brilliancy and an unchequered\r\nsuccess; but their dominion, like that of Greece, did not last for more\r\nthan 200 or 300 years. Rome grew slowly through many centuries, and its\r\ninfluence lasts to this day; the Turkish race battled with difficulties\r\nand reverses, and made its way on amid tumult and complication, for a\r\ngood 1,000 years from first to last, till at length it found itself in\r\npossession of Constantinople, and a terror to the whole of Europe. It\r\nhas ended its career upon the throne of Constantine; it began it as the\r\nslave and hireling of the rulers of a great empire, of Persia and\r\nSogdiana.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\nAs to Sogdiana, we have already reviewed one season of power and then in\r\nturn of reverse which there befell the Turks; and next a more remarkable\r\noutbreak and its reaction mark their presence in Persia. I have spoken\r\nof the formidable force, consisting of Turks, which formed the guard of\r\nthe Caliphs immediately after the time of Harun al Raschid:--suddenly\r\nthey rebelled against their master, burst into his apartment at the hour\r\nof supper, murdered him, and cut his body into seven pieces. They got\r\npossession of the symbols of imperial power, the garment and the staff\r\nof Mahomet, and proceeded to make and unmake Caliphs at their pleasure.\r\nIn the course of four years they had elevated, deposed, and murdered as\r\nmany as three. At their wanton caprice, they made these successors of\r\nthe false prophet the sport of their insults and their blows. They\r\ndragged them by the feet, stripped them, and exposed them to the burning\r\nsun, beat them with iron clubs, and left them for days without food. At\r\nlength, however, the people of Bagdad were roused in defence of the\r\nCaliphate, and the Turks for a time were brought under; but they\r\nremained in the country, or rather, by the short-sighted policy of the\r\nmoment, were dispersed throughout it, and thus became in the sequel\r\nready-made elements of revolution for the purposes of other traitors of\r\ntheir own race, who, at a later period, as we shall presently see,\r\ndescended on Persia from Turkistan.\r\n\r\nIndeed, events were opening the way slowly, but surely, to their\r\nascendancy. Throughout the whole of the tenth century, which followed,\r\nthey seem to disappear from history; but a silent revolution was all\r\nalong in progress, leading them forward to their great destiny. The\r\nempire of the Caliphate was already dying in its extremities, and\r\nSogdiana was one of the first countries to be detached from his power.\r\nThe Turks were still there, and, as in Persia, filled the ranks of the\r\narmy and the offices of the government; but the political changes which\r\ntook place were not at first to their visible advantage. What first\r\noccurred was the revolt of the Caliph's viceroy, who made himself a\r\ngreat kingdom or empire out of the provinces around, extending it from\r\nthe Jaxartes, which was the northern boundary of Sogdiana, almost to the\r\nIndian ocean, and from the confines of Georgia to the mountains of\r\nAffghanistan. The dynasty thus established lasted for four generations\r\nand for the space of ninety years. Then the successor happened to be a\r\nboy; and one of his servants, the governor of Khorasan, an able and\r\nexperienced man, was forced by circumstances to rebellion against him.\r\nHe was successful, and the whole power of this great kingdom fell into\r\nhis hands; now he was a Tartar or Turk; and thus at length the Turks\r\nsuddenly appear in history, the acknowledged masters of a southern\r\ndominion.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\nThis is the origin of the celebrated Turkish dynasty of the Gaznevides,\r\nso called after Gazneh, or Ghizni, or Ghuznee, the principal city, and\r\nit lasted for two hundred years. We are not particularly concerned in\r\nit, because it has no direct relations with Europe; but it falls into\r\nour subject, as having been instrumental to the advance of the Turks\r\ntowards the West. Its most distinguished monarch was Mahmood, and he\r\nconquered Hindostan, which became eventually the seat of the empire. In\r\nMahmood the Gaznevide we have a prince of true Oriental splendour. For\r\nhim the title of Sultan or Soldan was invented, which henceforth became\r\nthe special badge of the Turkish monarchs; as Khan is the title of the\r\nsovereign of the Tartars, and Caliph of the sovereign of the Saracens. I\r\nhave already described generally the extent of his dominions: he\r\ninherited Sogdiana, Carisme, Khorasan, and Cabul; but, being a zealous\r\nMussulman, he obtained the title of Gazi, or champion, by his reduction\r\nof Hindostan, and his destruction of its idol temples. There was no\r\nneed, however, of religious enthusiasm to stimulate him to the war: the\r\nriches, which he amassed in the course of it, were a recompense amply\r\nsufficient. His Indian expeditions in all amounted to twelve, and they\r\nabound in battles and sieges of a truly Oriental cast. \"Never,\" says a\r\ncelebrated historian,[36] \"was the Mussulman hero dismayed by the\r\ninclemency of the seasons, the height of the mountains, the breadth of\r\nthe rivers, the barrenness of the desert, the multitudes of the enemy,\"\r\nor their elephants of war. One of the sovereigns of the country brought\r\nagainst him as many as 2,500 elephants; the borderers on the Indus\r\nresisted him with 4,000 war-boats. He was successful in every direction;\r\nhe levelled to the ground many hundreds of pagodas, and carried off\r\ntheir treasures. In one of his campaigns[37] he took prisoner the prince\r\nof Lahore, round whose neck alone were sixteen strings of jewels, valued\r\nat £320,000 of our money. At Mutra he found five great idols of pure\r\ngold, with eyes of rubies; and a hundred idols of silver, which, when\r\nmelted down, loaded a hundred camels with bullion.\r\n\r\nThese stories, which sound like the fables in the Arabian Nights, are\r\nbut a specimen of the wonderful fruits of the victories of this Mahmood.\r\nHis richest prize was the great temple of Sunnat, or Somnaut, on the\r\npromontory of Guzerat, between the Indus and Bombay. It was a place as\r\ndiabolically wicked as it was wealthy, and we may safely regard Mahmood\r\nas the instrument of divine vengeance upon it. But here I am only\r\nconcerned with its wealth, for which grave writers are the vouchers.\r\nWhen this temple was taken, Mahmood entered a great square hall, having\r\nits lofty roof supported with 56 pillars, curiously turned and set with\r\nprecious stones. In the centre stood the idol, made of stone, and five\r\nfeet high. The conqueror began to demolish it. He raised his mace, and\r\nstruck off the idol's nose. The Brahmins interposed, and are said to\r\nhave offered the fabulous sum, as Mill considers it, of ten millions\r\nsterling for its ransom. His officers urged him to accept it, and the\r\nSultan himself was moved; but recovering himself, he observed that it\r\nwas somewhat more honourable to destroy idols than to traffic in them,\r\nand proceeded to repeat his blows at the trunk of the figure. He broke\r\nit open; it was found to be hollow, and at once explained the\r\nprodigality of the offer of the Brahmins. Inside was found an\r\nincalculable treasure of diamonds, rubies, and pearls. Mahmood took away\r\nthe lofty doors of sandal-wood, which belonged to this temple, as a\r\ntrophy for posterity. Till a few years ago, they were the decoration of\r\nhis tomb near Gazneh, which is built of white marble with a cupola, and\r\nwhere Moollas are still maintained to read prayers over his grave.[38]\r\nThere too once hung the ponderous mace, which few but himself could\r\nwield; but the mace has disappeared, and the sandal gates, if genuine,\r\nwere carried off about twelve years since by the British\r\nGovernor-General of India, and restored to their old place, as an\r\nacceptable present to the impure idolaters of Guzerat.[39]\r\n\r\nIt is not wonderful that this great conqueror should have been overcome\r\nby the special infirmity, to which such immense plunder would dispose\r\nhim; he has left behind him a reputation for avarice. He desired to be\r\na patron of literature, and on one occasion he promised a court poet a\r\ngolden coin for every verse of an heroic poem he was writing. Stimulated\r\nby the promise, \"the divine poet,\" to use the words of the Persian\r\nhistorian, \"wrote the unparalleled poem called the Shah Namna,\r\nconsisting of 60,000 couplets.\" This was more than had been bargained\r\nfor by the Sultan, who, repenting of his engagement, wished to\r\ncompromise the matter for 60,000 rupees, about a sixteenth part of the\r\nsum he had promised. The indignant author would accept no remuneration\r\nat all, but wrote a satire upon Mahmood instead; but he was merciful in\r\nhis revenge, for he reached no more than the seven-thousandth couplet.\r\n\r\nThere is a melancholy grandeur about the last days of this victorious\r\nSultan, which seems to show that even then the character of his race was\r\nchanged from the fierce impatience of Hun and Tartar to the grave,\r\npensive, and majestic demeanour of the Turk. Tartar he was in his\r\ncountenance, as he was painfully conscious, but his mind had a\r\nrefinement, to which the Tartar was a stranger. Broken down by an\r\nagonizing complaint, he perceived his life was failing, and his glory\r\ncoming to an end. Two days before his death, he commanded all the untold\r\nriches of his treasury, his sacks of gold and silver, his caskets of\r\nprecious stones, to be brought out and placed before him. Having feasted\r\nhis eyes upon them, he burst into tears; he knew they would not long be\r\nhis, but he had not the heart to give any part of then away. The next\r\nday he caused to be drawn up before his travelling throne, for he\r\nobserved still the Tartar custom, his army of 100,000 foot and 55,000\r\nhorse, his chariots, his camels, and his 1,300 elephants of war; and\r\nagain he wept, and, overcome with grief, retired to his palace. Next\r\nday he died, after a prosperous reign of more than thirty years.\r\n\r\nBut, to return to the general history. It will be recollected that\r\nMahmood's dominions stretched very far to the west, as some say, even\r\nround the Caspian to Georgia; and it is not wonderful that, while he was\r\nadding India to them, he found a difficulty in defending his frontier\r\ntowards Persia. Meantime, as before, his own countrymen kept streaming\r\ndown upon him without intermission from the north, and he thought he\r\ncould not do better than employ these dangerous visitors in garrison\r\nduty against his western enemies. They took service under him, but did\r\nnot fulfil his expectations. Indeed, what followed may be anticipated\r\nfrom the history which I have been giving of the Caliphs: it was an\r\ninstance of workmen emancipating themselves from their employer. The\r\nfierce barbarians who were defending the province of Khorasan so well\r\nfor another, naturally felt that they could take as good care of it for\r\nthemselves; and when Mahmood was approaching the end of his life, he\r\nbecame sensible of the error he had committed in introducing them. He\r\nasked one of their chiefs what force he could lend him: \"If you sent one\r\nof the arrows into our camp,\" was the answer, \"50,000 of us will mount\r\nto do thy bidding.\" \"But what if I want more?\" inquired Mahmood; \"send\r\nthis arrow into the camp of Balik, and you will have another 50,000.\"\r\nThe Sultan asked again: \"But what if I require your whole forces?\" \"Send\r\nround my bow,\" answered the Turk, \"and the summons will be obeyed by\r\n200,000 horse.\"[40] The foreboding, which disclosures such as this\r\ninspired, was fulfilled the year before his death. The Turks came into\r\ncollision with his lieutenants, and defeated one of them in a bloody\r\naction; and though he took full reprisals, and for a while cleared the\r\ncountry of them, yet in the reign of his son they succeeded in wresting\r\nfrom his dynasty one-half of his empire, and Hindostan, the acquisition\r\nof Mahmood, became henceforth its principal possession.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.\r\n\r\nWe have now arrived at what may literally be called the turning-point of\r\nTurkish history. We have seen them gradually descend from the north, and\r\nin a certain degree become acclimated in the countries where they\r\nsettled. They first appear across the Jaxartes in the beginning of the\r\nseventh century; they have now come to the beginning of the eleventh.\r\nFour centuries or thereabout have they been out of their deserts,\r\ngaining experience and educating themselves in such measure as was\r\nnecessary for playing their part in the civilized world. First they came\r\ndown into Sogdiana and Khorasan, and the country below it, as\r\nconquerors; they continued in it as subjects and slaves. They offered\r\ntheir services to the race which had subdued them; they made their way\r\nby means of their new masters down to the west and the south; they laid\r\nthe foundations for their future supremacy in Persia, and gradually rose\r\nupwards through the social fabric to which they had been admitted, till\r\nthey found themselves at length at the head of it. The sovereign power\r\nwhich they had acquired in the line of the Gaznevides, drifted off to\r\nHindostan; but still fresh tribes of their race poured down from the\r\nnorth, and filled up the gap; and while one dynasty of Turks was\r\nestablished in the peninsula, a second dynasty arose in the former seat\r\nof their power.\r\n\r\nNow I call the era at which I have arrived the turning-point of their\r\nfortunes, because, when they had descended down to Khorasan and the\r\ncountries below it, they might have turned to the East or to the West,\r\nas they chose. They were at liberty to turn their forces eastward\r\nagainst their kindred in Hindostan, whom they had driven out of Ghizni\r\nand Affghanistan, or to face towards the west, and make their way\r\nthither through the Saracens of Persia and its neighbouring countries.\r\nIt was an era which determined the history of the world. I recollect\r\nonce hearing a celebrated professor of geology attempt to draw out the\r\nconsequences which would have occurred, had there not been an outlet for\r\nthe Thames, which exists in fact, at a certain point of its course. He\r\nsaid that, had the range of hills been unbroken, it would have streamed\r\noff to the north-east, and have run into the sea at the Wash in\r\nLincolnshire. An utter change in the political events which came after,\r\nanother history of England, and nothing short of it, would have been the\r\nresult. An illustration such as this will at least serve to express what\r\nI would say of the point at which we now stand in the history of the\r\nTurks. Mahmood turned to the east; and had the barbarian tribes which\r\nsuccessively descended done the same, they might have conquered the\r\nGaznevide dynasty, they might have settled themselves, like Timour, at\r\nDelhi, and their descendants might have been found there by the British\r\nin their conquests during the last century; but they would have been\r\nunknown to Europe, they would have been strange to Constantinople, they\r\nwould have had little interest for the Church. They had rebelled against\r\nMahmood, they had driven his family to the East; but they did not pursue\r\nhim thither; he had strength enough to keep them off the rich territory\r\nhe had appropriated; he was the obstacle which turned the stream\r\nwestward; in consequence, they looked towards Persia, where their\r\nbrethren had been so long settled, and they directed their course for\r\ngood and all towards Europe.\r\n\r\nBut this era was a turning-point in their history in another and more\r\nserious respect. In Sogdiana and Khorasan, they had become converts to\r\nthe Mahometan faith. You will not suppose I am going to praise a\r\nreligious imposture, but no Catholic need deny that it is, considered in\r\nitself, a great improvement upon Paganism. Paganism has no rule of right\r\nand wrong, no supreme and immutable judge, no intelligible revelation,\r\nno fixed dogma whatever; on the other hand, the being of one God, the\r\nfact of His revelation, His faithfulness to His promises, the eternity\r\nof the moral law, the certainty of future retribution, were borrowed by\r\nMahomet from the Church, and are steadfastly held by his followers. The\r\nfalse prophet taught much which is materially true and objectively\r\nimportant, whatever be its subjective and formal value and influence in\r\nthe individuals who profess it. He stands in his creed between the\r\nreligion of God and the religion of devils, between Christianity and\r\nidolatry, between the West and the extreme East. And so stood the Turks,\r\non adopting his faith, at the date I am speaking of; they stood between\r\nChrist in the West, and Satan in the East, and they had to make their\r\nchoice; and, alas! they were led by the circumstances of the time to\r\noppose themselves, not to Paganism, but to Christianity. A happier lot\r\nindeed had befallen poor Sultan Mahmood than befell his kindred who\r\nfollowed in his wake. Mahmood, a Mahomedan, went eastward and found a\r\nsuperstition worse than his own, and fought against it, and smote it;\r\nand the sandal doors which he tore away from the idol temple and hung\r\nup at his tomb at Gazneh, almost seemed to plead for him through\r\ncenturies as the soldier and the instrument of Heaven. The tribes which\r\nfollowed him, Moslem also, faced westward, and found, not error but\r\ntruth, and fought against it as zealously, and in doing so, were simply\r\ntools of the Evil One, and preachers of a lie, and enemies, not\r\nwitnesses of God. The one destroyed idol temples, the other Christian\r\nshrines. The one has been saved the woe of persecuting the Bride of the\r\nLamb; the other is of all races the veriest brood of the serpent which\r\nthe Church has encountered since she was set up. For 800 years did the\r\nsandal gates remain at Mahmood's tomb, as a trophy over idolatry; and\r\nfor 800 years have Seljuk and Othman been our foe, singled out as such,\r\nand denounced by successive Vicars of Christ.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.\r\n\r\nThe year 1048 of our era is fixed by chronologists as the date of the\r\nrise of the Turkish power, as far as Christendom is interested in its\r\nhistory.[41] Sixty-three years before this date, a Turk of high rank, of\r\nthe name of Seljuk, had quarrelled with his native prince in Turkistan,\r\ncrossed the Jaxartes with his followers, and planted himself in the\r\nterritory of Sogdiana. His father had been a chief officer in the\r\nprince's court, and was the first of his family to embrace Islamism; but\r\nSeljuk, in spite of his creed, did not obtain permission to advance into\r\nSogdiana from the Saracenic government, which at that time was in\r\npossession of the country. After several successful encounters, however,\r\nhe gained admission into the city of Bokhara, and there he settled. As\r\ntime went on, he fully recompensed the tardy hospitality which the\r\nSaracens had shown him; for his feud with his own countrymen, whom he\r\nhad left, took the shape of a religious enmity, and he fought against\r\nthem as pagans and infidels, with a zeal, which was both an earnest of\r\nthe devotion of his people to the faith of Mahomet, and a training for\r\nthe exercise of it. He died, it is said, in battle against the pagans,\r\nand at the wonderful age of 107. Of his five sons, whom he left behind\r\nhim, one, Michael, was cut off prematurely in battle against the\r\ninfidels also, and has obtained the name of Shadid or the Martyr; for in\r\na religion where the soldier is the missionary, the soldier is the\r\nmartyr also. The other sons became rich and powerful; they had numerous\r\nflocks and fertile pastures in Sogdiana, till at length they attracted\r\nthe notice of the Sultan Mahmood, who, having dispossessed the Saracens\r\nof the country where Seljuk had placed himself, looked about for\r\nmercenary troops to keep his possession of it. It was one of Seljuk's\r\nfamily, who at a later date alarmed Mahmood by telling him he could\r\nbring 200,000 horsemen from the Scythian wilderness, if he sent round\r\nhis bow to summon them; it was Seljuk's horde and retainers that\r\nultimately forced back Mahmood's son into the south and the east, and\r\ngot possession of Sogdiana and Khorasan. Having secured this\r\nacquisition, they next advanced into Persia, and this was the event,\r\nwhich is considered to fix the date of their entrance into\r\necclesiastical history. It was the date of their first steadily looking\r\nwestward; it determined their destiny; they began to be enemies of the\r\nCross in the year 1048, under the leading of Michael the Martyr's son,\r\nTogrul Beg.\r\n\r\nIt is the inconvenience of any mere sketch of historical transactions,\r\nthat a multiplicity of objects successively passes over the field of\r\nview, not less independent in themselves, though not less connected in\r\nthe succession of events, than the pictures of a magic lantern. I am\r\naware of the weariness and the perplexity which are in consequence\r\ninflicted on the attention and the memory of the hearer; but what can I\r\ndo but ask your indulgence, Gentlemen, for a circumstance which is\r\ninherent in any undertaking like the present? I have in the course of an\r\nhour to deal with a series of exploits and fortunes, which begin in the\r\nwilds of Turkistan, and conclude upon the Bosphorus; in which, as I may\r\nsay, time is no measure of events, one while from the obscurity in which\r\nthey lie, at another from their multitude and consequent confusion. For\r\nfour centuries the Turks are little or hardly heard of; then suddenly in\r\nthe course of as many tens of years, and under three Sultans, they make\r\nthe whole world resound with their deeds; and, while they have pushed to\r\nthe East through Hindostan, in the West they have hurried down to the\r\ncoasts of the Mediterranean and the Archipelago, have taken Jerusalem,\r\nand threatened Constantinople. In their long period of silence they had\r\nbeen sowing the seeds of future conquests; in their short period of\r\naction they were gathering the fruit of past labours and sufferings. The\r\nSaracenic empire stood apparently as before; but, as soon as a Turk\r\nshowed himself at the head of a military force within its territory, he\r\nfound himself surrounded by the armies of his kindred which had been so\r\nlong in its pay; he was joined by the tribes of Turcomans, to whom the\r\nRomans in a former age had shown the passes of the Caucasus; and he\r\ncould rely on the reserve of innumerable swarms, ever issuing out of his\r\nnative desert, and following in his track. Such was the state of Western\r\nAsia in the middle of the eleventh century.\r\n\r\n\r\n7.\r\n\r\nI have said there were three great Sultans of the race of Seljuk, by\r\nwhom the conquest of the West of Asia was begun and completed; their\r\nnames are Togrul Beg, Alp Arslan, and Malek Shah. I have not to write\r\ntheir histories, but I may say a few words of their characters and their\r\nactions.\r\n\r\n1. The first, Togrul, was the son and grandson of Mahometan Martyrs, and\r\nhe inherited that fanaticism, which made the old Seljuk and the young\r\nMichael surrender their lives in their missionary warfare against the\r\nenemies of their faith. Each day he repeated the five prayers prescribed\r\nfor the disciples of Islam; each week he gave two days to fasting; in\r\nevery city which he made his own, he built a mosque before he built his\r\npalace. He introduced vast numbers of his wild countrymen into his\r\nprovinces, and suffered their nomadic habits, on the condition of their\r\nbecoming proselytes to his creed. He was the man suited to his time;\r\nmere material power was not adequate to the overthrow of the Saracenic\r\nsovereignty: rebellion after rebellion had been successful against the\r\nCaliph; and at the very time I speak of he was in subjection to a family\r\nof the old Persian race. But then he was spiritual head of the Empire as\r\nwell as temporal; and, though he lay in his palace wallowing in brutal\r\nsensuality, he was still a sort of mock-Pope, even after his armies and\r\nhis territories had been wrested from his hands; but it was the reward\r\nof Togrul's zeal to gain from him this spiritual prerogative, retaining\r\nwhich the Caliph could never have fallen altogether. He gave to Togrul\r\nthe title of Rocnoddîn, or \"the firm pillar of religion;\" and, what was\r\nmore to the purpose, he made him his vicegerent over the whole Moslem\r\nworld. Armed with this religious authority, which was temporal in its\r\noperation, he went to war against the various insurgents who troubled\r\nthe Caliph's repose, and substituted himself for them, a more powerful\r\nand insidious enemy than any or all. But even Mahomet, the Caliph's\r\npredecessor, would not have denied that Togrul was worthy of his hire;\r\nhe turned towards Armenia and Asia Minor, and began that terrible war\r\nagainst the Cross, which was to last 500 years. The prodigious number of\r\n130,000 Christians, in battle or otherwise, is said to be the sacrifice\r\nhe offered up to the false prophet. On his victorious return, he was\r\nagain recognized by his grateful master as his representative. He made\r\nhis public entry into the imperial city on horseback. At the palace gate\r\nhe showed the outward deference to the Caliph's authority which was his\r\npolicy. He dismounted, his nobles laid aside their arms, and thus they\r\nwalked respectfully into the recesses of the palace. According to the\r\nSaracenic ceremonial, the Caliph received them behind his black veil,\r\nthe black garment of his family was cast over his shoulders, and the\r\nstaff of Mahomet was in his hand. Togrul kissed the ground, and waited\r\nmodestly, till he was led to the throne, and was there allowed to seat\r\nhimself, and to hear the commission publicly declaring him invested with\r\nthe authority of the Vicar of the Arch-deceiver. He was then\r\nsuccessively clothed in seven robes of honour, and presented with seven\r\nslaves, the natives of the seven climates of the Saracenic Empire. His\r\nveil was perfumed with musk; two crowns were set upon his head; two\r\nscimitars were girded on his side, in token of his double reign over\r\nEast and West. He twice kissed the Caliph's hand; and his titles were\r\nproclaimed by the voice of heralds and the applause of the Moslem.\r\n\r\nSuch was Togrul Beg, and such was his reward. After these exploits, he\r\nmarched against his brother (for these Turkish tribes were always\r\nquarrelling over their prey), deposed him, strangled him and put to\r\ndeath a number of his adherents, married the Caliph's daughter, and then\r\ndied without children. His power passed to his nephew Alp Arslan.\r\n\r\n2. Alp Arslan, the second Sultan of the line of Seljuk, is said to\r\nsignify in Turkish \"the courageous lion:\" and the Caliph gave its\r\npossessor the Arabic appellation of Azzaddin, or \"Protector of\r\nReligion.\" It was the distinctive work of his short reign to pass from\r\nhumbling the Caliph to attacking the Greek Emperor. Togrul had already\r\ninvaded the Greek provinces of Asia Minor, from Cilicia to Armenia,\r\nalong a line of 600 miles, and here it was that he had achieved his\r\ntremendous massacres of Christians. Alp Arslan renewed the war; he\r\npenetrated to Cæsarea in Cappadocia, attracted by the gold and pearls\r\nwhich encrusted the shrine of the great St. Basil. He then turned his\r\narms against Armenia and Georgia, and conquered the hardy mountaineers\r\nof the Caucasus, who at present give such trouble to the Russians. After\r\nthis he encountered, defeated, and captured the Greek Emperor. He began\r\nthe battle with all the solemnity and pageantry of a hero of romance.\r\nCasting away his bow and arrows, he called for an iron mace and\r\nscimitar; he perfumed his body with musk, as if for his burial, and\r\ndressed himself in white, that he might be slain in his winding-sheet.\r\nAfter his victory, the captive Emperor of New Rome was brought before\r\nhim in a peasant's dress; he made him kiss the ground beneath his feet,\r\nand put his foot upon his neck. Then, raising him up, he struck or\r\npatted him three times with his hand, and gave him his life and, on a\r\nlarge ransom, his liberty. At this time the Sultan was only forty-four\r\nyears of age, and seemed to have a career of glory still before him.\r\nTwelve hundred nobles stood before his throne; two hundred thousand\r\nsoldiers marched under his banner. As if dissatisfied with the South, he\r\nturned his arms against his own paternal wildernesses, with which his\r\nfamily, as I have related, had a feud. New tribes of Turks seem to have\r\npoured down, and were wresting Sogdiana from the race of Seljuk, as the\r\nSeljukians had wrested it from the Gaznevides. Alp had not advanced far\r\ninto the country, when he met his death from the hand of a captive. A\r\nCarismian chief had withstood his progress, and, being taken, was\r\ncondemned to a lingering execution. On hearing the sentence, he rushed\r\nforward upon Alp Arslan; and the Sultan, disdaining to let his generals\r\ninterfere, bent his bow, but, missing his aim, received the dagger of\r\nhis prisoner in his breast. His death, which followed, brings before us\r\nthat grave dignity of the Turkish character, of which we have already\r\nhad an example in Mahmood. Finding his end approaching, he has left on\r\nrecord a sort of dying confession:--\"In my youth,\" he said, \"I was\r\nadvised by a sage to humble myself before God, to distrust my own\r\nstrength, and never to despise the most contemptible foe. I have\r\nneglected these lessons, and my neglect has been deservedly punished.\r\nYesterday, as from an eminence, I beheld the numbers, the discipline,\r\nand the spirit of my armies; the earth seemed to tremble under my feet,\r\nand I said in my heart, Surely thou art the king of the world, the\r\ngreatest and most invincible of warriors. These armies are no longer\r\nmine; and, in the confidence of my personal strength, I now fall by the\r\nhand of an assassin.\" On his tomb was engraven an inscription, conceived\r\nin a similar spirit. \"O ye, who have seen the glory of Alp Arslan\r\nexalted to the heavens, repair to Maru, and you will behold it buried in\r\nthe dust.\"[42] Alp Arslan was adorned with great natural qualities both\r\nof intellect and of soul. He was brave and liberal: just, patient, and\r\nsincere: constant in his prayers, diligent in his alms, and, it is\r\nadded, witty in his conversation;--but his gifts availed him not.\r\n\r\n3. It often happens in the history of states and races, in which there\r\nis found first a rise and then a decline, that the greatest glories take\r\nplace just then when the reverse is beginning or begun. Thus, for\r\ninstance, in the history of the Ottoman Turks, to which I have not yet\r\ncome, Soliman the Magnificent is at once the last and greatest of a\r\nseries of great Sultans. So was it as regards this house of Seljuk.\r\nMalek Shah, the son of Alp Arslan, the third sovereign, in whom its\r\nglories ended, is represented to us in history in colours so bright and\r\nperfect, that it is difficult to believe we are not reading the account\r\nof some mythical personage. He came to the throne at the early age of\r\nseventeen; he was well-shaped, handsome, polished both in manners and in\r\nmind; wise and courageous, pious and sincere. He engaged himself even\r\nmore in the consolidation of his empire than in its extension. He\r\nreformed abuses; he reduced the taxes; he repaired the high roads,\r\nbridges, and canals; he built an imperial mosque at Bagdad; he founded\r\nand nobly endowed a college. He patronised learning and poetry, and he\r\nreformed the calendar. He provided marts for commerce; he upheld the\r\npure administration of justice, and protected the helpless and the\r\ninnocent. He established wells and cisterns in great numbers along the\r\nroad of pilgrimage to Mecca; he fed the pilgrims, and distributed\r\nimmense sums among the poor.\r\n\r\nHe was in every respect a great prince; he extended his conquests across\r\nSogdiana to the very borders of China. He subdued by his lieutenants\r\nSyria and the Holy Land, and took Jerusalem. He is said to have\r\ntravelled round his vast dominions twelve times. So potent was he, that\r\nhe actually gave away kingdoms, and had for feudatories great princes.\r\nHe gave to his cousin his territories in Asia Minor, and planted him\r\nover against Constantinople, as an earnest of future conquests; and he\r\nmay be said to have finally allotted to the Turcomans the fair regions\r\nof Western Asia, over which they roam to this day.\r\n\r\nAll human greatness has its term; the more brilliant was this great\r\nSultan's rise, the more sudden was his extinction; and the earlier he\r\ncame to his power, the earlier did he lose it He had reigned twenty\r\nyears, and was but thirty-seven years old, when he was lifted up with\r\npride and came to his end. He disgraced and abandoned to an assassin his\r\nfaithful vizir, at the age of ninety-three, who for thirty years had\r\nbeen the servant and benefactor of the house of Seljuk. After obtaining\r\nfrom the Caliph the peculiar and almost incommunicable title of \"the\r\ncommander of the faithful,\" unsatisfied still, he wished to fix his own\r\nthrone in Bagdad, and to deprive his impotent superior of his few\r\nremaining honours. He demanded the hand of the daughter of the Greek\r\nEmperor, a Christian, in marriage. A few days, and he was no more; he\r\nhad gone out hunting, and returned indisposed; a vein was opened, and\r\nthe blood would not flow. A burning fever took him off, only eighteen\r\ndays after the murder of his vizir, and less than ten before the day\r\nwhen the Caliph was to have been removed from Bagdad.\r\n\r\n\r\n8.\r\n\r\nSuch is human greatness at the best, even were it ever so innocent; but\r\nas to this poor Sultan, there is another aspect even of his glorious\r\ndeeds. If I have seemed here or elsewhere in these Lectures to speak of\r\nhim or his with interest or admiration, only take me, Gentlemen, as\r\ngiving the external view of the Turkish history, and that as\r\nintroductory to the determination of its true significance. Historians\r\nand poets may celebrate the exploits of Malek; but what were they in the\r\nsight of Him who has said that whoso shall strike against His\r\ncorner-stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, shall be\r\nground to powder? Looking at this Sultan's deeds as mere exhibitions of\r\nhuman power, they were brilliant and marvellous; but there was another\r\njudgment of them formed in the West, and other feelings than admiration\r\nroused by them in the faith and the chivalry of Christendom. Especially\r\nwas there one, the divinely appointed shepherd of the poor of Christ,\r\nthe anxious steward of His Church, who from his high and ancient watch\r\ntower, in the fulness of apostolic charity, surveyed narrowly what was\r\ngoing on at thousands of miles from him, and with prophetic eye looked\r\ninto the future age; and scarcely had that enemy, who was in the event\r\nso heavily to smite the Christian world, shown himself, when he gave\r\nwarning of the danger, and prepared himself with measures for averting\r\nit. Scarcely had the Turk touched the shores of the Mediterranean and\r\nthe Archipelago, when the Pope detected and denounced him before all\r\nEurope. The heroic Pontiff, St. Gregory the Seventh, was then upon the\r\nthrone of the Apostle; and though he was engaged in one of the severest\r\nconflicts which Pope has ever sustained, not only against the secular\r\npower, but against bad bishops and priests, yet at a time when his very\r\nlife was not his own, and present responsibilities so urged him, that\r\none would fancy he had time for no other thought, Gregory was able to\r\nturn his mind to the consideration of a contingent danger in the almost\r\nfabulous East. In a letter written during the reign of Malek Shah, he\r\nsuggested the idea of a crusade against the misbeliever, which later\r\npopes carried out. He assures the Emperor of Germany, whom he was\r\naddressing, that he had 50,000 troops ready for the holy war, whom he\r\nwould fain have led in person. This was in the year 1074.\r\n\r\nIn truth, the most melancholy accounts were brought to Europe of the\r\nstate of things in the Holy Land. A rude Turcoman ruled in Jerusalem;\r\nhis people insulted there the clergy of every profession; they dragged\r\nthe patriarch by the hair along the pavement, and cast him into a\r\ndungeon, in hopes of a ransom; and disturbed from time to time the Latin\r\nMass and office in the Church of the Resurrection. As to the pilgrims,\r\nAsia Minor, the country through which they had to travel in an age when\r\nthe sea was not yet safe to the voyager, was a scene of foreign\r\nincursion and internal distraction. They arrived at Jerusalem exhausted\r\nby their sufferings, and sometimes terminated them by death, before they\r\nwere permitted to kiss the Holy Sepulchre.\r\n\r\n\r\n9.\r\n\r\nOutrages such as these were of frequent occurrence, and one was very\r\nlike another. In concluding, however, this Lecture, I think it worth\r\nwhile to set before you, Gentlemen, the circumstances of one of them in\r\ndetail, that you may be able to form some ideas of the state both of\r\nAsia Minor and of a Christian pilgrimage, under the dominion of the\r\nTurks. You may recollect, then, that Alp Arslan, the second Seljukian\r\nSultan, invaded Asia Minor, and made prisoner the Greek Emperor. This\r\nSultan came to the throne in 1062, and appears to have begun his warlike\r\noperations immediately. The next year, or the next but one, a body of\r\npilgrims, to the number of 7,000, were pursuing their peaceful way to\r\nJerusalem, by a route which at that time lay entirely through countries\r\nprofessing Christianity.[43] The pious company was headed by the\r\nArchbishop of Mentz, the Bishops of Utrecht, Bamberg, and Ratisbon, and,\r\namong others, by a party of Norman soldiers and clerks, belonging to the\r\nhousehold of William Duke of Normandy, who made himself, very soon\r\nafterwards, our William the Conqueror. Among these clerks was the\r\ncelebrated Benedictine Monk Ingulphus, William's secretary, afterwards\r\nAbbot of Croyland in Lincolnshire, being at that time a little more than\r\nthirty years of age. They passed through Germany and Hungary to\r\nConstantinople, and thence by the southern coast of Asia Minor or\r\nAnatolia, to Syria and Palestine. When they got on the confines of Asia\r\nMinor towards Cilicia, they fell in with the savage Turcomans, who were\r\nattracted by the treasure, which these noble persons and wealthy\r\nchurchmen had brought with them for pious purposes and imprudently\r\ndisplayed. Ingulphus's words are few, but so graphic that I require an\r\napology for using them. He says then, they were \"exenterated\" or\r\n\"cleaned out of the immense sums of money they carried with them,\r\ntogether with the loss of many lives.\"\r\n\r\nA contemporary historian gives us fuller particulars of the adventure,\r\nand he too appears to have been a party to the expedition.[44] It seems\r\nthe prelates celebrated the rites of the Church with great\r\nmagnificence, as they went along, and travelled with a pomp which became\r\ngreat dignitaries. The Turcomans in consequence set on them, overwhelmed\r\nthem, stripped them to the skin, and left the Bishop of Utrecht disabled\r\nand half dead upon the field. The poor sufferers effected their retreat\r\nto a village, where they fortified an enclosure and took possession of a\r\nbuilding which stood within it. Here they defended themselves\r\ncourageously for as many as three days, though they are said to have had\r\nnothing to eat. At the end of that time they expressed a wish to\r\nsurrender themselves to the enemy, and admitted eighteen of the\r\nbarbarian leaders into their place of strength, with a view of\r\nnegotiating the terms. The Bishop of Bamberg, who is said to have had a\r\nstriking presence, acted for the Christians, and bargained for nothing\r\nmore than their lives. The savage Turcoman, who was the speaker on the\r\nother side, attracted by his appearance, unrolled his turban, and threw\r\nit round the Bishop's neck, crying out: \"You and all of you are mine.\"\r\nThe Bishop made answer by an interpreter: \"What will you do to me?\" The\r\nsavage shrieked out some unintelligible words, which, being explained to\r\nthe Bishop, ran thus: \"I will suck that blood which is so ruddy in your\r\nthroat, and then I will hang you up like a dog at your gate.\" \"Upon\r\nwhich,\" says the historian, \"the Bishop, who had the modesty of a\r\ngentleman, and was of a grave disposition, not bearing the insult,\r\ndashed his fist into the Turcoman's face with such vigour as to fell him\r\nto the ground, crying out that the profane wretch should rather be the\r\nsufferer, for laying his unclean hands upon a priest.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the signal for an exploit so bold, that it seemed, if I may so\r\nexpress myself, like a particular inspiration. The Christians, unarmed\r\nas they were, started up, and though, as I have observed, they may be\r\nsaid to have scarcely tasted food for three days, rushed upon the\r\neighteen Turcomans, bound their arms behind their backs, and showing\r\nthem in this condition to their own troops who surrounded the house,\r\nprotested that they would instantly put them all to death, unless they\r\nthemselves were let go. It is difficult to see how this complication\r\nwould have ended, in which neither side were in a condition either to\r\nrecede or to advance, had not a third party interfered with a\r\nconsiderable force in the person of the military governor, himself a\r\nPagan,[45] of a neighbouring city; and though, as our historian says,\r\nthe Christians found it difficult to understand how Satan could cast out\r\nSatan, so it was, that they found themselves at liberty and their\r\nenemies marched off to punishment, on the payment of a sum of money to\r\ntheir deliverers. I need not pursue the history of these pilgrims\r\nfurther than to say, that, of 7,000 who set out, only 2,000 returned to\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMuch less am I led to enter into the history of the Crusades which\r\nfollowed. How the Holy See, twenty years after St. Gregory, effected\r\nthat which St. Gregory attempted without result; how, along the very way\r\nwhich the pilgrims I have described journeyed, 100,000 men at length\r\nappeared cased in complete armour and on horseback; how they drove the\r\nTurk from Nicæa over against Constantinople, where he had fixed his\r\nimperial city, to the farther borders of Asia Minor; how, after\r\ndefeating him in a pitched battle at Dorylæum, they went on and took\r\nAntioch, and then at length, after a long pilgrimage of three years,\r\nmade conquest of Jerusalem itself, I need not here relate. To one point\r\nonly is it to our present purpose to direct attention. It is commonly\r\nsaid that the Crusades failed in their object; that they were nothing\r\nelse but a lavish expenditure of men and treasure; and that the\r\npossession of the Holy Places by the Turks to this day is a proof of it.\r\nNow I will not enter here into a very intricate controversy; this only\r\nwill I say, that, if the tribes of the desert, under the leadership of\r\nthe house of Seljuk, turned their faces to the West in the middle of the\r\neleventh century; if in forty years they had advanced from Khorasan to\r\nJerusalem and the neighbourhood of Constantinople; and if in consequence\r\nthey were threatening Europe and Christianity; and if, for that reason,\r\nit was a great object to drive them back or break them to pieces; if it\r\nwere a worthy object of the Crusades to rescue Europe from this peril\r\nand to reassure the anxious minds of Christian multitudes;--then were\r\nthe Crusades no failure in their issue, for this object was fully\r\naccomplished. The Seljukian Turks were hurled back upon the East, and\r\nthen broken up, by the hosts of the Crusaders.[46] The lieutenant of\r\nMalek Shah, who had been established as Sultan of Roum (as Asia Minor\r\nwas called by the Turks), was driven to an obscure town, where his\r\ndynasty lasted, indeed, but gradually dwindled away. A similar fate\r\nattended the house of Seljuk in other parts of the Empire, and internal\r\nquarrels increased and perpetuated its weakness. Sudden as was its rise,\r\nas sudden was its fall; till the terrible Zingis, descending on the\r\nTurkish dynasties, like an avalanche, coöperated effectually with the\r\nCrusaders and finished their work; and if Jerusalem was not protected\r\nfrom other enemies, at least Constantinople was saved, and Europe was\r\nplaced in security, for three hundred years.[47]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[35] Thornton.\r\n\r\n[36] Gibbon.\r\n\r\n[37] Vid.

Also Mr. Francis Newman; \"The\r\nSee of Rome,\" he says, \"had not forgotten, if Europe had, how deadly and\r\ndangerous a war Charles Martel and the Franks had had to wage against\r\nthe Moors from Spain. A new and redoubtable nation, the Seljuk Turks,\r\nhad now appeared on the confines of Europe, as a fresh champion of the\r\nMohammedan Creed; and it is not attributing too much foresight or too\r\nsagacious policy to the Court of Rome, to believe, that they wished to\r\nstop and put down the Turkish power before it should come too near. Be\r\nthis as it may, such was the result. The might of the Seljukians was\r\ncrippled on the plains of Palestine, and did not ultimately reach\r\nEurope.... A large portion of Christendom, which disowned the religious\r\npretensions of Rome, was afterwards subdued by another Turkish tribe,\r\nthe Ottomans or Osmanlis; but Romish Christendom remained untouched:\r\nPoland, Germany, and Hungary, saved her from the later Turks, even\r\nduring the schism of the Reformation, as the Franks had saved her from\r\nthe Moors. On the whole, it would seem that to the Romish Church we have\r\nbeen largely indebted for that union between European nations, without\r\nwhich Mohammedanism might perhaps not have been repelled. I state this\r\nas probable, not at all as certain.\"--_Lectures at Manchester, 1846._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nTHE CONQUESTS OF THE TURKS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE V.\r\n\r\n_The Turk and the Christian._\r\n\r\n\r\nI Said in my last Lecture, that we are bound to judge of persons and\r\nevents in history, not by their outward appearance, but by their inward\r\nsignificancy. In speaking of the Turks, we may for a moment yield to the\r\nromance which attends on their name and their actions, as we may admire\r\nthe beauty of some beast of prey; but, as it would be idle and puerile\r\nto praise its shape or skin, and form no further judgment upon it, so in\r\nlike manner it is unreal and unphilosophical to interest ourselves in\r\nthe mere adventures and successes of the Turks, without going on to view\r\nthem in their moral aspect also. No race casts so broad and dark a\r\nshadow on the page of ecclesiastical history, and leaves so painful an\r\nimpression on the minds of the reader, as the Turkish. The fierce Goths\r\nand Vandals, and then again the Lombards, were converted to Catholicism.\r\nThe Franks yielded to the voice of St. Remigius, and Clovis, their\r\nleader, became the eldest son of the Church. The Anglo-Saxons gave up\r\ntheir idols at the preaching of St. Augustine and his companions. The\r\nGerman tribes acknowledged Christ amid their forests, though they\r\nmartyred St. Boniface and other English and Irish missionaries who came\r\nto them. The Magyars in Hungary were led to faith through loyalty to\r\ntheir temporal monarch, their royal missioner St. Stephen. The heathen\r\nDanes reappear as the chivalrous Normans, the haughty but true sons and\r\nvassals of St. Peter. The Saracens even, who gave birth to an imposture,\r\nwithered away at the end of 300 or 400 years, and had not the power,\r\nthough they had the will, to persevere in their enmity to the Cross. The\r\nTartars had both the will and the power, but they were far off from\r\nChristendom, or they came down in ephemeral outbreaks, which were rather\r\nthose of freebooters than of persecutors, or they directed their fury as\r\noften against the enemies of the Church as against her children. But the\r\nunhappy race, of whom I am speaking, from the first moment they appear\r\nin the history of Christendom, are its unmitigated, its obstinate, its\r\nconsistent foes. They are inexhaustible in numbers, pouring down upon\r\nthe South and West, and taking one and the same terrible mould of\r\nmisbelief, as they successively descend. They have the populousness of\r\nthe North, with the fire of the South; the resources of Tartars, with,\r\nthe fanaticism of Saracens. And when their strength declines, and age\r\nsteals upon them, there is no softening, no misgiving; they die and make\r\nno sign. In the words of the Wise Man, \"Being born, they forthwith\r\nceased to be; and have been able to show no mark of virtue, but are\r\nconsumed in wickedness.\" God's judgments, God's mercies, are\r\ninscrutable; one nation is taken, another is left. It is a mystery; but\r\nthe fact stands; since the year 1048 the Turks have been the great\r\nAntichrist among the races of men.\r\n\r\nI say since this date, because then it was that Togrul Beg finally\r\nopened the gates of the North to those descents, which had taken place\r\nindeed at intervals before, but then became the habit of centuries. In\r\nvain was the power of his dynasty overthrown by the Crusaders; in vain\r\ndo the Seljukians disappear from the annals of the world; in vain is\r\nConstantinople respited; in vain is Europe saved. Christendom in arms\r\nhad not yet finished, it had but begun the work, in which it needed the\r\ngrace to persevere. Down came the savage hordes, as at first, upon\r\nSogdiana and Khorasan, so then upon Syria and its neighbouring\r\ncountries. Sometimes they remain wild Turcomans, sometimes they fall\r\ninto the civilization of the South; but there they are, in Egypt, in the\r\nHoly Land, in Armenia, in Anatolia, forming political bodies of long or\r\nshort duration, breaking up here to form again there, in all cases\r\ntrampling on Christianity, and beating out its sacred impression from\r\nthe breasts of tens of thousands. Nor is this all; scarcely is the race\r\nof Seljuk quite extinct, or rather when it is on its very death-bed,\r\nafter it had languished and shrunk and dwindled and flickered and kept\r\non dying through a tedious two hundred years, when its sole remaining\r\nheir was just in one obscure court, from that very court we discern the\r\nbirth of another empire, as dazzling in its rise, as energetic and\r\nimpetuous in its deeds as that of Togrul, Alp, and Malek, and far more\r\nwide-spreading, far more powerful, far more lasting than the Seljukian.\r\nThis is the empire of the great (if I must measure it by a human\r\nstandard) and glorious race of Othman; this is the dynasty of the\r\nOttomans or Osmanlis; once the admiration, the terror of nations, now,\r\neven in its downfall, an object of curiosity, interest, anxiety, and\r\neven respect; but, whether high or low, in all cases to the Christian\r\nthe inveterate and hateful enemy of the Cross.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\nThere is a certain remarkable parallel and contrast between the fortunes\r\nof these two races, the Seljukian and the Ottoman. In the beginning of\r\nthe twelfth century, the race of Seljuk all but took Constantinople, and\r\noverran the West, and did not; in the beginning of the fifteenth, the\r\nOttoman Turks were all but taking the same city, and then were withheld\r\nfrom taking it, and at length did take it, and have it still. In each\r\ncase a foe came upon them from the north, still more fierce and vigorous\r\nthan they, and humbled them to the dust.\r\n\r\nThese two foes, which came upon the Seljukian Turks and the Ottoman\r\nTurks respectively, are names by this time familiar to us; they are\r\nZingis and Timour. Zingis came down upon the Seljukians, and Timour came\r\ndown upon the Ottomans. Timour pressed the Ottomans even more severely\r\nthan Zingis pressed the Seljukians; yet the Seljukians did not recover\r\nthe blow of Zingis; but the Ottomans survived the blow of Timour, and\r\nrose more formidable after it, and have long outlived the power which\r\ninflicted it.\r\n\r\nZingis and Timour were but the blind instruments of divine vengeance.\r\nThey knew not what they did. The inward impulse of gigantic energy and\r\nbrutal cupidity urged them forward; ambition, love of destruction,\r\nsensual appetite, frenzied them, and made them both more and less than\r\nmen. They pushed eastward, westward, southward; they confronted promptly\r\nand joyfully every peril, every obstacle which lay in their course. They\r\nsmote down all rival pride and greatness of man; and therefore, by the\r\nlaw (as I may call it) of their nature and destiny, not on politic\r\nreason or far-reaching plan, but because they came across him, they\r\nsmote the Turk. These then were one class of his opponents; but there\r\nwas another adversary, stationed against him, of a different order, one\r\nwhose power was not material, but mental and spiritual; one whose enmity\r\nwas not random, or casual, or temporary, but went on steadily from age\r\nto age, and lasts down to this day, except so far as the Turk's\r\ndecrepitude has at length disarmed anxiety and opposition. I have spoken\r\nof him already; of course I mean the Vicar of Christ. I mean the\r\nzealous, the religious enmity to every anti-Christian power, of him who\r\nhas outlasted Zingis and Timour, who has outlasted Seljuk, who is now\r\noutlasting Othman. He incited Christendom against the Seljukians, and\r\nthe Seljukians, assailed also by Zingis, sunk beneath the double blow.\r\nHe tried to rouse Christendom against the Ottomans also, but in vain;\r\nand therefore in vain did Timour discharge his overwhelming, crushing\r\nforce against them. Overwhelmed and crushed they were, but they revived.\r\nThe Seljukians fell, in consequence of the united zeal of the great\r\nChristian commonwealth moving in panoply against them; the Ottomans\r\nsucceeded by reason of its deplorable divisions, and its decay of faith\r\nand heroism.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\nWhether indeed in the long run, and after all his disappointments and\r\nreverses, the Pope was altogether unsuccessful in his warfare against\r\nthe Ottomans, we shall see by-and-by; but certainly, if perseverance\r\nmerited a favourable issue, at least he has had a right to expect it.\r\nWar with the Turks was his uninterrupted cry for seven or eight\r\ncenturies, from the eleventh to the eighteenth; it is a solitary and\r\nsingular event in the history of the Church. Sylvester the Second was\r\nthe originator of the scheme of a union of Christian nations against\r\nthem. St. Gregory the Seventh collected 50,000 men to repel them. Urban\r\nthe Second actually set in motion the long crusade. Honorius the Second\r\ninstituted the order of Knight Templars to protect the pilgrims from\r\ntheir assaults. Eugenius the Third sent St. Bernard to preach the Holy\r\nWar. Innocent the Third advocated it in the august Council of the\r\nLateran. Nicholas the Fourth negotiated an alliance with the Tartars for\r\nits prosecution. Gregory the Tenth was in the Holy Land in the midst of\r\nit, with our Edward the First, when he was elected Pope. Urban the Fifth\r\nreceived and reconciled the Greek Emperor with a view to its renewal.\r\nInnocent the Sixth sent the Blessed Peter Thomas the Carmelite to preach\r\nin its behalf. Boniface the Ninth raised the magnificent army of French,\r\nGermans, and Hungarians, who fought the great battle of Nicopolis.\r\nEugenius the Fourth formed the confederation of Hungarians and Poles who\r\nfought the battle of Varna. Nicholas the Fifth sent round St. John\r\nCapistran to urge the princes of Christendom against the enemy.\r\nCallixtus the Third sent the celebrated Hunniades to fight with them.\r\nPius the Second addressed to their Sultan an apostolic letter of warning\r\nand denunciation. Sixtus the Fourth fitted out a fleet against them.\r\nInnocent the Eighth made them his mark from the beginning of his\r\nPontificate to the end. St. Pius the Fifth added the \"Auxilium\r\nChristianorum\" to our Lady's Litany in thankfulness for his victory over\r\nthem. Gregory the Thirteenth with the same purpose appointed the\r\nFestival of the Rosary. Clement the Ninth died of grief on account of\r\ntheir successes. The venerable Innocent the Eleventh appointed the\r\nFestival of the Holy Name of Mary, for their rout before Vienna.\r\nClement the Eleventh extended the Feast of the Rosary to the whole\r\nChurch for the great victory over them near Belgrade. These are but some\r\nof the many instances which might be given; but they are enough for the\r\npurpose of showing the perseverance of the Popes.\r\n\r\nNor was their sagacity in this matter less remarkable than their\r\npertinacity. The Holy See has the reputation, even with men of the\r\nworld, of seeing instinctively what is favourable, what is unfavourable,\r\nto the interests of religion and of the Catholic Faith. Its undying\r\nopposition to the Turks is not the least striking instance of this\r\ndivinely imparted gift. From the very first it pointed at them as an\r\nobject of alarm for all Christendom, in a way in which it had marked out\r\nneither Tartars nor Saracens. It exposed them to the reprobation of\r\nEurope, as a people, with whom, if charity differ from merciless\r\nferocity, tenderness from hardness of heart, depravity of appetite from\r\nvirtue, and pride from meekness and humility, the faithful never could\r\nhave sympathy, never alliance. It denounced, not merely an odious\r\noutlying deformity, painful simply to the moral sight and scent, but an\r\nenergetic evil, an aggressive, ambitious, ravenous foe, in whom foulness\r\nof life and cruelty of policy were methodized by system, consecrated by\r\nreligion, propagated by the sword. I am not insensible, I wish to do\r\njustice, to the high qualities of the Turkish race. I do not altogether\r\ndeny to its national character the grandeur, the force and originality,\r\nthe valour, the truthfulness and sense of justice, the sobriety and\r\ngentleness, which historians and travellers speak of; but, in spite of\r\nall that has been done for them by nature and by the European world,\r\nTartar still is the staple of their composition, and their gifts and\r\nattainments, whatever they may be, do but make them the more efficient\r\nfoes of faith and civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\nIt was said by a Prophet of old, in the prospect of a fierce invader, \"a\r\nday of clouds and whirlwinds, a numerous and strong people, as the\r\nmorning spread upon the mountains. The like to it hath not been from the\r\nbeginning, nor shall be after it, even to the years of generation and\r\ngeneration. Before the face thereof a devouring fire, and behind it a\r\nburning flame. The land is like a garden of pleasure before it, and\r\nbehind it a desolate wilderness; neither is there any one can escape\r\nit.\" Now I might, in illustration of the character which the Turks bear\r\nin history, suitably accommodate these words to the moral, or the\r\nsocial, or the political, or the religious calamities, of which they\r\nwere the authors to the Christian countries they overran; and so I might\r\nbring home to you the meaning and drift of that opposition with which\r\nthe Holy See has met them in every age. I might allude (if I dare, but I\r\ndare not, nor does any one dare),--else, allusion might be made to those\r\nunutterable deeds which brand the people which allows them, even in the\r\nnatural judgment of men, as the most flagitious, the most detestable of\r\nnations. I might enlarge on the reckless and remorseless cruelty which,\r\nhad they succeeded in Europe, as they succeeded in Asia, would have\r\ndecimated or exterminated her children; I might have reminded you, for\r\ninstance, how it has been almost a canon of their imperial policy for\r\ncenturies, that their Sultan, on mounting the throne, should destroy his\r\nnearest of kin, father, brother, or cousin, who might rival him in his\r\nsovereignty; how he is surrounded, and his subjects according to their\r\nwealth, with slaves carried off from their homes, men and boys, living\r\nmonuments of his barbarity towards the work of God's hands; how he has\r\nat his remorseless will and in the sudden breath of his mouth the life\r\nor death of all his subjects; how he multiplies his despotism by giving\r\nto his lieutenants in every province, a like prerogative; how little\r\nscruple those governors have ever felt in exercising this prerogative to\r\nthe full, in executions on a large scale, and sudden overwhelming\r\nmassacres, shedding blood like water, and playing with the life of man\r\nas though it were the life of a mere beast or reptile. I might call your\r\nattention to particular instances of such atrocities, such as that\r\noutrage perpetrated in the memory of many of us,--how, on the\r\ninsurrection of the Greeks at Scio, their barbarian masters carried fire\r\nand sword throughout the flourishing island till it was left a desert,\r\nhurrying away women and boys to an infamous captivity, and murdering\r\nyouths and grown men, till out of 120,000 souls, in the spring time, not\r\n900 were left there when the crops were ripe for the sickle. If I do not\r\ngo into scenes such as these in detail, it is because I have wearied and\r\ntroubled you more than enough already, in my account of the savage\r\nperpetrations of Zingis and Timour.\r\n\r\nOr I might, in like manner, still more obviously insist on their system\r\nof compulsory conversion, which, from the time of the Seljukian Sultans\r\nto the present day, have raised the indignation and the compassion of\r\nthe Christian world; how, when the lieutenants of Malek Shah got\r\npossession of Asia Minor, they profaned the churches, subjected Bishops\r\nand Clergy to the most revolting outrages, circumcised the youth, and\r\nled off their sisters to their profligate households;--how, when the\r\nOttomans conquered in turn, and added an infantry, I mean the\r\nJanizaries, to their Tartar horse, they formed that body of troops, from\r\nfirst to last, for near five hundred years, of boys, all born Christian,\r\na body of at first 12,000, at last 40,000 strong, torn away year by year\r\nfrom their parents, circumcised, trained to the faith and morals of\r\ntheir masters, and becoming in their turn the instruments of the\r\nterrible policy of which they had themselves been victims; and how, when\r\nat length lately they abolished this work of their hands, they ended it\r\nby the slaughter of 20,000 of the poor renegades whom they had seduced\r\nfrom their God. I might remind you how within the last few years a\r\nProtestant traveller tells us that he found the Nestorian Christians,\r\nwho had survived the massacres of their race, living in holes and pits,\r\ntheir pastures and tillage land forfeited, their sheep and cattle driven\r\naway, their villages burned, and their ministers and people tortured;\r\nand how a Catholic missionary has found in the neighbourhood of Broussa\r\nthe remnant of some twenty Catholic families, who, in consequence of\r\nrepudiating the Turkish faith, had been carried all the way from Servia\r\nand Albania across the sea to Asia Minor; the men killed, the women\r\ndisgraced, the boys sold, till out of a hundred and eighty persons but\r\neighty-seven were left, and they sick, and famished, and dying among\r\ntheir unburied dead. I could of course continue this topic also to any\r\nextent, and draw it out as an illustration of the words of the Prophet\r\nwhich I have quoted. But I prefer to take those words literally, as\r\nexpressive of the desolation spread by an infidel foe over the face of a\r\nflourishing country; and then I shall be viewing the Turkish rule under\r\nan aspect addressed to the senses, not admitting of a question,\r\ncalculated to rouse the sensibilities of Christians of whatever caste of\r\nopinion, and explanatory by itself of the determined front which the\r\nHoly See has ever made against it.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic Church was in the first instance a wanderer on the earth,\r\nand had nothing to attach her to its soil; but no sooner did persecution\r\ncease, and territory was allowed to her, than she began to exert a\r\nbeneficent influence upon the face of the land, and on its cultivators.\r\nShe shed her consolations, and extended her protection, over the serf\r\nand the slave; and, while she gradually relaxed his fetters, she sent\r\nher own dearest children to bear his burden with him, and to aid him in\r\nthe cultivation of the soil. Under the loving assiduity of the\r\nBenedictine Monk, the ravages of war were repaired, the plantation\r\nthrove, the river diffused itself in rills and channels, and hill and\r\ndale and plain rejoiced in corn land and pasture. And when in a later\r\ntime a world was to be created, not restored, when the deep forests of\r\nthe North were to be cleared, and the unwholesome marsh to be drained,\r\nwho but the missionaries from the same great Order were to be the\r\nministers of temporal, as well as spiritual, benefits to the rude tribes\r\nthey were converting? And then again, when history moved on into the era\r\nof the first Turkish outbreak, who but St. Bernard, the very preacher of\r\nthe Crusade, who but he led on his peaceful Cistercians, after the\r\npattern of his master, St. Stephen, to that laborious but cheerful\r\nhusbandry, which they continue in the wild places of the earth even to\r\nthis day? Never has Holy Church forgotten,--abhorrent, as she is, from\r\nthe Pantheistic tendencies which in all ages have surrounded her,--never\r\nhas she forgotten the interests of that mighty mother on whose bosom we\r\nfeed in life, into whose arms we drop in death; never has she forgotten\r\nthat that mother is the special creature of God, and to be honoured, in\r\nleaf and flower, in lofty tree and pleasant stream, for His sake, as\r\nwell as for our own; that while it is our primeval penalty to till the\r\nearth, she lovingly repays us for our toil; that Adam was a gardener\r\neven in Paradise, and that Noe inaugurated his new world by \"beginning\r\nto be a husbandman, and by planting a vineyard.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the genius of the true faith; and it might have been thought,\r\nthat, though not Christians, even of very gratitude, the barbarous race,\r\nwhich owed a part of whatever improvement of mind or manners they had\r\nreceived to the fair plains of Sogdiana, would, on seizing on their rich\r\nand beautiful lands on the north, east, and south of the Mediterranean,\r\nhave felt some sort of reverence for their captive, and, while enjoying\r\nher gifts, would have been merciful to the giver. But the same selfish\r\nsensuality, with which they regard the rational creation of God,\r\npossesses them in their conduct towards physical nature. They have made\r\nthe earth their paramour, and are heartless towards her dishonour and\r\nher misery. We have lately been reminded in this place of the Doge of\r\nVenice[48] making the Adriatic his bride, and claiming her by a ring of\r\nespousal; but the Turk does not deign to legitimatize his possession of\r\nthe soil he has violently seized, or to gain a title to it by any sacred\r\ntie; caring for no better right to it than the pirate has to the\r\njurisdiction of the high seas. Let the Turcoman ride up and down Asia\r\nMinor or Syria for a thousand years, how is the trampling of his\r\nhorse-hoofs a possession of those countries, more than a Scythian raid\r\nor a Tartar gallop across it? The imperial Osmanli sits and smokes long\r\ndays in his pavilion, without any thought at all of his broad domain\r\nexcept to despise and to plunder and impoverish its cultivators; and is\r\nhis title made better thereby than the Turcoman's, to be the heir of\r\nAlexander and Seleucus, of the Ptolemies and Massinissa, of Constantine\r\nand Justinian? What claim does it give him upon Europe, Asia, and\r\nAfrica, upon Greece, Palestine, and Egypt, that he has frustrated the\r\nmunificence of nature and demolished the works of man?\r\n\r\n\r\n5.\r\n\r\nAsia Minor especially, the peninsula which lies between the Black Sea,\r\nthe Archipelago, and the Mediterranean, was by nature one of the most\r\nbeautiful, and had been made by art one of the most fertile of\r\ncountries. It had for generations contained flourishing marts of\r\ncommerce, and it had been studded with magnificent cities, the ruins of\r\nwhich now stand as a sepulchre of the past. No country perhaps has seen\r\nsuch a succession of prosperous states, and had such a host of\r\nhistorical reminiscences, under such distinct eras and such various\r\ndistributions of territory. It is memorable in the beginning of history\r\nfor its barbarian kings and nobles, whose names stand as commonplaces\r\nand proverbs of wealth and luxury. The magnificence of Pelops imparts\r\nlustre even to the brilliant dreams of the mythologist. The name of\r\nCroesus, King of Lydia, whom I have already had occasion to mention,\r\ngoes as a proverb for his enormous riches. Midas, King of Phrygia, had\r\nsuch abundance of the precious metals, that he was said by the poets to\r\nhave the power of turning whatever he touched into gold. The tomb of\r\nMausolus, King of Caria, was one of the seven wonders of the ancient\r\nworld. It was the same with the Greek colonies which were scattered\r\nalong its coasts; they are renowned for opulence, for philosophy, and\r\nfor the liberal and the fine arts. Homer among the poets, Thales among\r\nphilosophers, Herodotus, the father of history, Hippocrates, the oracle\r\nof physicians, Apelles, the prince of painters, were among their\r\ncitizens; and Pythius, who presented one of the Persian Kings with a\r\nplane-tree and a vine of massive gold, was in his day, after those\r\nkings, the richest man in the known world.\r\n\r\nThen come the many splendid cities founded by the successors of\r\nAlexander, through its extent; and the powerful and opulent kingdoms,\r\nGreek or Barbarian, of Pontus, and Bithynia, and Pergamus--Pergamus,\r\nwith its library of 200,000 choice volumes. Later still, the resources\r\nof the country were so well recognised, that it was the favourite prey\r\nof the Roman statesmen, who, after involving themselves in enormous\r\ndebts in the career of ambition, needed by extortion and rapine to set\r\nthemselves right with their creditors. Next it became one of the first\r\nseats of Christianity; St. Luke in the Acts of the Apostles relates to\r\nus the apostolic labours of St. Paul there in town and country; St. John\r\nwrote the Apocalypse to the Churches of seven of its principal cities;\r\nand St. Peter, his first Epistle to Christians scattered through its\r\nprovinces. It was the home of some of the greatest Saints, Martyrs, and\r\nDoctors of the early ages: there first, in Bithynia, the power of\r\nChristianity manifested itself over a heathen population; there St.\r\nPolycarp was martyred, there St. Gregory Thamaturgus converted the\r\ninhabitants of Pontus; there St. Gregory Nazianzen, St. Gregory Nyssen,\r\nSt. Basil, and St. Amphilochius preached and wrote. There were held\r\nthree of the first four Councils of the Church, at Chalcedon, at\r\nEphesus, and at Nicæa, the very city afterwards profaned by the palace\r\nof the Sultan. It abounded in the gifts of nature, for food, utility, or\r\nornament; its rivers ran with gold, its mountains yielded the most\r\ncostly marbles; it had mines of copper, and especially of iron; its\r\nplains were fruitful in all kinds of grain, in broad pastures and\r\nluxuriant woods, while its hills were favourable to the olive and the\r\nvine.\r\n\r\nSuch was that region, once celebrated for its natural advantages, for\r\nits arts, its splendour, as well as for its gifts of grace; and the\r\nmisery and degradation which are at present imprinted on the very face\r\nof the soil are the emblems of that worse ruin which has overtaken the\r\nsouls of its children. I have already referred to the journal of Dr.\r\nChandler, who saw it, even in its western coast, overrun by the hideous\r\ntents of the Turcomans. Another traveller of late years[49] tells us of\r\nthat ancient Bithynia, which runs along the Black Sea, a beautiful and\r\nromantic country, intersected with lofty mountains and fertile valleys,\r\nand abounding in rivers and forests. The luxuriance of the pastures, he\r\nsays, and the richness of the woods, often reminded him of an English\r\ngentleman's park. Such is it as nature has furnished it for the benefit\r\nof man; but he found its forests covered with straggling Turcomans and\r\nnumerous flocks of goats. As he was passing through Phrygia, the\r\ninhabitants smiled, when he asked for ruins, assuring him that the whole\r\ncountry was overspread with them. There too again he found a great part\r\nof its face covered with the roving Turcomans, \"a boisterous and\r\nignorant race, though much more honourable and hospitable,\" he adds,\r\n\"than the inhabitants of the towns.\" Mr. Alison tells us that when the\r\nEnglish fleet, in 1801, was stationed on the southern coast, some\r\nsailors accidentally set fire to a thick wood, and the space thus left\r\nbare was studded all along with the ruins of temples and palaces.\r\n\r\nA still more recent traveller[50] corroborates this testimony. Striking\r\ninland from Smyrna, he found \"the scenery extremely beautiful, and the\r\nland,\" he continues, \"which is always rich, would be valuable, if\r\nsufficiently cultivated, but it is much neglected.\" In another part of\r\nthe country, he \"rode for at least three miles through a ruined city,\r\nwhich was one pile of temples, theatres, and buildings, vying with each\r\nother in splendour.\" Now here, you will observe, I am not finding fault\r\nwith the mere circumstance that the scenes of ancient grandeur should\r\nabound in ruins. Buildings will decay; old buildings will not answer new\r\nuses; there are ruins enough in Europe; but the force of the argument\r\nlies in this, that in these countries there are ruins and nothing else;\r\nthat the old is gone, and has not been replaced by the new. So was it\r\nabout Smyrna; and so too about Sardis: \"Its situation,\" he says, \"is\r\nvery beautiful, but the country over which it looks is now almost\r\ndeserted, and the valley is become a swamp. Its little rivers of clear\r\nwater, after turning a mill or two, serve only to flood, instead of\r\ndraining and beautifying the country.\" His descriptions of the splendour\r\nof the scenery, yet of the desolation of the land, are so frequent that\r\nI should not be able to confine my extracts within bounds, did I attempt\r\nto give them all. He speaks of his route as lying through \"a rich\r\nwilderness\" of ruins. Sometimes the landscape \"so far exceeded the\r\nbeauty of nature, as to seem the work of magic.\" Again, \"the splendid\r\nview passed like a dream; for the continual turns in the road, and the\r\nincreasing richness of the woods and vegetation, soon limited my view to\r\na mere foreground. Nor was this without interest; on each projecting\r\nrock stood an ancient sarcophagus; and the trees half concealed the lids\r\nand broken sculpture of innumerable tombs.\"\r\n\r\nThe gifts of nature remain; he was especially struck with the trees. \"We\r\ntraversed the coast,\" he says, \"through woods of the richest trees, the\r\nplanes being the handsomest to be found in this or perhaps any other\r\npart of the world. I have never seen such stupendous arms to any trees.\"\r\nEverything was running wild; \"the underwood was of myrtle, growing\r\nsometimes twenty feet high, the beautiful daphne laurel, and the\r\narbutus; and they seemed contending for preëminence with the vine,\r\nclematis, and woodbine, which climbed to the very tops, and in many\r\ninstances bore them down into a thicket of vegetation, impervious except\r\nto the squirrels and birds, which, sensible of their security in these\r\nretreats, stand boldly to survey the traveller.\" Elsewhere he found the\r\nground carpeted with the most beautiful flowers. A Protestant\r\nMissionary,[51] in like manner, travelling in a different part of the\r\ncountry, speaks of the hedges of wild roses, the luxuriant gardens and\r\nfruit-trees, principally the cherry, the rich soil, the growth of beech,\r\noak, and maple, the level meadows and swelling hills covered with the\r\nrichest sward, and the rivulets of the purest water. No wonder that, as\r\nhe tells us, \"sitting down under a spreading walnut-tree, by the side of\r\na murmuring mill stream, he was led by the charming woodland scenery\r\naround to reflect upon that mysterious Providence, by which so beautiful\r\na country has been placed under such a blighting government, in the\r\nhands of so ignorant and barbarous a people.\"\r\n\r\nThe state of the population is in keeping with the neglected condition\r\nof the country. It is, down to the present time, wasting away; and that\r\nthere are inhabitants at all seems in the main referable to merely\r\naccidental causes. On the road from Angora to Constantinople there were\r\nold people, twenty years since, who remembered as many as forty or fifty\r\nvillages, where now there are none; and in the middle of the last\r\ncentury two hundred places had become forsaken in the tract lying\r\nbetween those two cities and Smyrna.[52]\r\n\r\nThis desolation is no accident of a declining empire; it dates from the\r\nvery time that a Turk first came into the country, from the era of the\r\nSeljukian Sultans, eight hundred years ago. We have indirect but clear\r\nproof of it in the course of history following their expulsion from the\r\ncountry by the Crusaders. For a while the Greeks recovered their\r\ndominion in its western portion, and fixed their imperial residence at\r\nNicæa, which had been the capital of the Seljukians. A vigorous prince\r\nmounted the throne, and the main object of his exertions and the special\r\nwork of his reign was the recovery of the soil. We are told by an\r\nEnglish historian,[53] that he found the most fertile lands without\r\neither cultivation or inhabitants, and he took them into his own\r\nmanagement. It followed that, in the course of some years, the imperial\r\ndomain became the granary and garden of Asia; and the sovereign made\r\nmoney without impoverishing his people. According to the nature of the\r\nsoil, he sowed it with corn, or planted it with vines, or laid it down\r\nin grass: his pastures abounded with herds and flocks, horses and swine;\r\nand his speculation, as it may be called, in poultry was so happy, that\r\nhe was able to present his empress with a crown of pearls and diamonds\r\nout of his gains. His example encouraged his nobles to imitation; and\r\nthey learned to depend for their incomes on the honourable proceeds of\r\ntheir estates, instead of oppressing their people, and seeking favours\r\nfrom the court. Such was the immediate consequence when man coöperated\r\nwith the bountifulness of nature in this fruitful region; and it brings\r\nout prominently by its contrast the wretchedness of the Turkish\r\ndomination.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.\r\n\r\nThat wretchedness is found, not in Asia Minor only, but wherever Turks\r\nare to be found in power. Throughout the whole extent of their\r\nterritory, if you believe the report of travellers, the peasantry are\r\nindigent, oppressed, and wretched.[54] The great island of Crete or\r\nCandia would maintain four times its present population; once it had a\r\nhundred cities; many of its towns, which were densely populous, are now\r\nobscure villages. Under the Venetians it used to export corn largely;\r\nnow it imports it. As to Cyprus, from holding a million of inhabitants,\r\nit now has only 30,000. Its climate was that of a perpetual spring; now\r\nit is unwholesome and unpleasant; its cities and towns nearly touched\r\none another, now they are simply ruins. Corn, wine, oil, sugar, and the\r\nmetals are among its productions; the soil is still exceedingly rich;\r\nbut now, according to Dr. Clarke, in that \"paradise of the Levant,\r\nagriculture is neglected, inhabitants are oppressed, population is\r\ndestroyed.\" Cross over to the continent, and survey Syria and its\r\nneighbouring cities; at this day the Turks themselves are dying out;\r\nDiarbekr, which numbered 400,000 souls in the middle of last century,\r\nforty years afterwards had dwindled to 50,000. Mosul had lost half its\r\ninhabitants; Bagdad had fallen from 130,000 to 20,000; and Bassora from\r\n100,000 to 8,000.\r\n\r\nIf we pass on to Egypt, the tale is still the same. \"In the fifteenth\r\ncentury,\" says Mr. Alison, \"Egypt, after all the revolutions which it\r\nhad undergone, was comparatively rich and populous; but since the fatal\r\nera of Turkish conquest, the tyranny of the Pashas has expelled\r\nindustry, riches, and the arts.\" Stretch across the width of Africa to\r\nBarbary, wherever there is a Turk, there is desolation. What indeed have\r\nthe shepherds of the desert, in the most ambitious effort of their\r\ncivilization, to do with the cultivation of the soil? \"That fertile\r\nterritory,\" says Robertson, \"which sustained the Roman Empire, still\r\nlies in a great measure uncultivated; and that province, which Victor\r\ncalled _Speciositas totius terræ florentis_, is now the retreat of\r\npirates and banditti.\"\r\n\r\nEnd your survey at length with Europe, and you find the same account is\r\nto be given of its Turkish provinces. In the Morea, Chateaubriand,\r\nwherever he went, beheld villages destroyed by fire and sword, whole\r\nsuburbs deserted, often fifteen leagues without a single habitation. \"I\r\nhave travelled,\" says Mr. Thornton, \"through several provinces of\r\nEuropean Turkey, and cannot convey an idea of the state of desolation in\r\nwhich that beautiful country is left. For the space of seventy miles,\r\nbetween Kirk Kilise and Carnabat, there is not an inhabitant, though the\r\ncountry is an earthly paradise. The extensive and pleasant village of\r\nFaki, with its houses deserted, its gardens overrun with weeds and\r\ngrass, its lands waste and uncultivated, and now the resort of robbers,\r\naffects the traveller with the most painful sensations.\"[55] Even in\r\nWallachia and Moldavia the population has been gradually decreasing,\r\nwhile of that rich country not more than a fortieth part is under\r\ntillage. In a word, the average population in the whole Empire is not a\r\nfifth of what it was in ancient times.\r\n\r\n\r\n7.\r\n\r\nHere I am tempted to exclaim (though the very juxtaposition of two\r\ncountries so different from each other in their condition needs an\r\napology), I cannot help exclaiming, how different is the condition of\r\nthat other peninsula in the centre of which is placed the See of Peter!\r\nI am ashamed of comparing, or even contrasting, Italy with Asia\r\nMinor--the seat of Christian governments with the seat of a barbarian\r\nrule--except that, since I have been speaking of the tenderness which\r\nthe Popes have shown, according to their means, for the earth and its\r\ncultivators, there is a sort of fitness in pointing out that the result\r\nis in their case conformable to our just anticipation. Besides, so much\r\nis uttered among us in disparagement of the governments of that\r\nbeautiful country, that there is a reason for pressing the contrast on\r\nthe attention of those, who in their hearts acknowledge little\r\ndifference between the rulers of Italy and of Turkey. I think it will be\r\ninstructive, then, to dwell upon the account given us of Italy by an\r\nintelligent and popular writer of this day; nor need we, in doing so,\r\nconcern ourselves with questions which he elsewhere discusses, such as\r\nwhether Italy has received the last improvements in agriculture, or in\r\ncivil economy, or in finance, or in politics, or in mechanical\r\ncontrivances; in short, whether the art of life is carried there to its\r\nperfection. Systems and codes are to be tested by their results; let us\r\nput aside theories and disputable points; let us survey a broad,\r\nundeniable, important fact; let us look simply at the state both of the\r\nland and of the population in Italy; let us take it as our gauge and\r\nestimate of political institutions; let us, by way of contrast, put it\r\nside by side of the state of land and population, as reported to us by\r\ntravellers in Turkey.\r\n\r\nMr. Alison, then, in his most diligent and interesting history of\r\nEurope,[56] divides the extent of Italy into three great districts, of\r\nmountain, plain, and marsh. The region of marsh lies between the\r\nApennines and the Mediterranean; and here, I confess, he finds fault\r\nwith the degree of diligence in reclaiming it exerted by its present\r\npossessors. He notices with dissatisfaction that the marshes of Volterra\r\nare still as pestilential as in the days of Hannibal; moreover, that the\r\nCampagna of Rome, once inhabited by numerous tribes, is now an almost\r\nuninhabited desert, and that the Pontine Marshes, formerly the abode of\r\nthirty nations, are now a pestilential swamp. I will not stop to remind\r\nyou that the irruptions of barbarians like the Turks, have been the\r\ncauses of this desolation, that the existing governments had nothing to\r\ndo with it, and that, on the contrary, they have made various efforts to\r\novercome the evil. For argument's sake, I will allow them to be a\r\nreproach to the government, for they will be found to be only exceptions\r\nto the general state of the country. Even as regards this low tract, he\r\nspeaks of one portion of it, the plain of the Clitumnus, as being rich,\r\nas in ancient days, in herds and flocks; and he enlarges upon the\r\nCampagna of Naples as \"still the scene of industry, elegance, and\r\nagricultural riches. There,\" he says, \"still, as in ancient times, an\r\nadmirable cultivation brings to perfection the choicest gifts of\r\nnature. Magnificent crops of wheat and maize cover the rich and level\r\nexpanse; rows of elms or willows shelter their harvests from the too\r\nscorching rays of the sun; and luxuriant vines, clustering to the very\r\ntops of the trees, are trained in festoons from one summit to the other.\r\nOn its hills the orange, the vine, and the fig-tree flourish in\r\nluxuriant beauty; the air is rendered fragrant by their ceaseless\r\nperfume; and the prodigy is here exhibited of the fruit and the flower\r\nappearing at the same time on the same stem.\"\r\n\r\nSo much for that portion of Italy which owes least to the labours of the\r\nhusbandman: the second portion is the plain of Lombardy, which stretches\r\nthree hundred miles in length by one hundred and twenty in breadth, and\r\nwhich, he says, \"beyond question is the richest and the most fertile in\r\nEurope.\" This great plain is so level, that you may travel two hundred\r\nmiles in a straight line, without coming to a natural eminence ten feet\r\nhigh; and it is watered by numerous rivers, the Ticino, the Adda, the\r\nAdige, and others, which fall into the great stream of the Po, the \"king\r\nof rivers,\" as Virgil calls it, which flows majestically through its\r\nlength from west to east till it finds its mouth in the Adriatic. It is\r\nobvious, from the testimony of the various travellers in the East, whom\r\nI have cited, what would be the fate of this noble plain under a Turkish\r\ngovernment; it would become nothing more or less than one great and\r\ndeadly swamp. But Mr. Alison observes: \"It is hard to say, whether the\r\ncultivation of the soil, the riches of nature, or the structures of\r\nhuman industry in this beautiful region, are most to be admired. An\r\nunrivalled system of agriculture, from which every nation in Europe\r\nmight take a lesson, has long been established over its whole surface,\r\nand two, and sometimes three successive crops annually reward the\r\nlabours of the husbandman. Indian corn is produced in abundance, and by\r\nits return, quadruple that of wheat, affords subsistence for a numerous\r\nand dense population. Rice arrives at maturity to a great extent in the\r\nmarshy districts; and an incomparable system of irrigation, diffused\r\nover the whole, conveys the waters of the Alps to every field, and in\r\nsome places to every ridge, in the grass lands. It is in these rich\r\nmeadows, stretching round Lodi, and from thence to Verona, that the\r\ncelebrated Parmesan cheese, known over all Europe for the richness of\r\nits flavour, is made. The vine and the olive thrive in the sunny slopes\r\nwhich ascend from the plain to the ridges of the Alps; and a woody zone\r\nof never-failing beauty lies between the desolation of the mountain and\r\nthe fertility of the plain.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n8.\r\n\r\nSuch is his language concerning the cultivation at present bestowed upon\r\nthe great plain of Italy; but after all it is for the third or\r\nmountainous region of the country, where art has to supply the\r\ndeficiencies of nature, that he reserves his enthusiastic praises. After\r\nspeaking of what nature really does for it in the way of vegetation and\r\nfruits, he continues: \"An admirable terrace-cultivation, where art and\r\nindustry have combined to overcome the obstacles of nature, has\r\neverywhere converted the slopes, naturally sterile and arid, into a\r\nsuccession of gardens, loaded with the choicest vegetable productions. A\r\ndelicious climate there brings the finest fruits to maturity; the grapes\r\nhang in festoons from tree to tree; the song of the nightingale is heard\r\nin every grove; all nature seems to rejoice in the paradise which the\r\nindustry of man has created. To this incomparable system of\r\nhorticulture, which appears to have been unknown to the ancient Romans,\r\nand to have been introduced into Europe by the warriors who returned\r\nfrom the Crusades, the riches and smiling aspect of Tuscany and the\r\nmountain-region of Italy are chiefly to be ascribed; for nothing can be\r\nmore desolate by nature than the waterless declivities, in general\r\nalmost destitute of soil, on which it has been formed. The earth\r\nrequired to be brought in from a distance, retaining walls erected, the\r\nsteep slopes converted into a series of gentle inclinations, the\r\nmountain-torrent diverted or restrained, and the means of artificial\r\nirrigation, to sustain nature during the long droughts of summer,\r\nobtained. By the incessant labour of centuries this prodigy has been\r\ncompleted, and the very stony sterility of nature converted into the\r\nmeans of heightening, by artificial means, the heat of summer.... No\r\nroom is lost in these little but precious freeholds; the vine extends\r\nits tendrils along the terrace walls ... in the corners formed by their\r\nmeeting, a little sheltered nook is found, where fig-trees are planted,\r\nwhich ripen delicious fruit under their protection. The owner takes\r\nadvantage of every vacant space to raise melons and vegetables. Olives\r\nshelter it from the rains; so that, within the compass of a very small\r\ngarden, he obtains olives, figs, grapes, pomegranates, and melons. Such\r\nis the return which nature yields under this admirable system of\r\nmanagement, that half the crop of seven acres is sufficient in general\r\nfor the maintenance of a family of five persons, and the whole produce\r\nsupports them all in rustic affluence. Italy, in this delightful region,\r\nstill realizes the glowing description of her classic historian three\r\nhundred years ago.\"\r\n\r\nThe author I have quoted goes on next to observe that this diligent\r\ncultivation of the rock accounts for what at first sight is\r\ninexplicable, viz., the vast population, which is found, not merely in\r\nthe valleys, but over the greater part of the ridges of the Apennines,\r\nand the endless succession of villages and hamlets which are perched on\r\nthe edge or summit of rocks, often, to appearance, scarcely accessible\r\nto human approach. He adds that the labour never ends, for, if a place\r\ngoes out of repair, the violence of the rain will soon destroy it.\r\n\"Stones and torrents wash down the soil; the terraces are broken\r\nthrough; the heavy rains bring down a shapeless mass of ruins;\r\neverything returns rapidly to its former state.\" Thus it is that parts\r\nof Palestine at present exhibit such desolate features to the traveller,\r\nwho wonders how it ever could have been the rich land described in\r\nScripture; till he finds that it was this sort of cultivation which made\r\nit what it was, that this it was the Crusaders probably saw and imported\r\ninto Europe, and this that the ruthless Turks in great measure laid\r\nwaste.\r\n\r\nLastly, he speaks of the population of Italy; as to the towns, it has\r\ndeclined on account of the new channels of commerce which nautical\r\ndiscovery has opened, to the prejudice of the marts and ports of the\r\nmiddle ages. In spite of this, however, he says, \"that the provinces\r\nhave increased both in riches and inhabitants, and the population of\r\nItaly was never, either in the days of the Emperors, or of the modern\r\nRepublics, so considerable as it is at the present moment. In the days\r\nof Napoleon, it gave 1,237 to the square marine league, a density\r\ngreater than that of either France or England at that period. This\r\npopulousness of Italy,\" he adds, \"is to be explained by the direction of\r\nits capital to agricultural investment, and the increasing industry with\r\nwhich, during a long course of centuries, its inhabitants have overcome\r\nthe sterility of nature.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the contrast between Italy under its present governments and\r\nAsia Minor under the Turks; and can we doubt at all, that, if the Turks\r\nhad conquered Italy, they would have caused the labours of the\r\nagriculturist and the farmer to cease, and have reduced it to the level\r\nof their present dominions?\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[48] Vid. a beautiful passage in Cardinal Wiseman's late lecture at\r\nLiverpool.\r\n\r\n[49] Vid.

We left off with the Crusaders victorious\r\nin the Holy Land, and the Seljukian Sultan, the cousin of Malek Shah,\r\ndriven back from his capital over against Constantinople, to an obscure\r\ntown on the Cilician border of Asia Minor. This is that Sultan Soliman,\r\nwho plays so conspicuous a part in Tasso's celebrated Poem of \"Jerusalem\r\nDelivered,\"--\r\n\r\n  That Solyman, than whom there was not any\r\n    Of all God's foes more rebel an offender;\r\n  Nay, nor a giant such, among the many\r\n    Whom earth once bore, and might again engender;\r\n  The Turkish Prince, who first the Greeks expelling,\r\n  Fixed at Nicæa his imperial dwelling.\r\n\r\n  And then he made his infidel advances\r\n    From Phrygian Sangar to Meander's river;\r\n  Lydia and Mysia, humbled in war's chances,\r\n    Bithynia, Pontus, hymned the Arch-deceiver;\r\n  But when to Asia passed the Christian lances,\r\n    To battle with the Turk and misbeliever,\r\n  He, in two fields, encountered two disasters,\r\n  And so he fled, and the vexed land changed masters.\r\n\r\nTwo centuries of military effort followed, and then the contest seemed\r\nover; the barbarians of the North destroyed, and Europe free. It seemed\r\nas though the Turks had come to their end and were dying out, as the\r\nSaracens had died out before them, when suddenly, when the breath of the\r\nlast Seljukian Sultan was flitting at Iconium, and the Crusaders had\r\nbroken their last lance for the Holy Sepulchre, on the 27th of July,\r\n1301, the rule and dynasty of the Ottomans rose up from his death-bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\nOthman, the founder of the line and people, who take from him the name\r\nof Ottoman or Osmanli, was the grandson of a nomad Turk, or Turcoman,\r\nwho, descending from the North by Sogdiana and the Oxus, took the\r\nprescriptive course (as I may call it) towards social and political\r\nimprovement. His son, Othman's father, came into the service of the last\r\nSultan of the Seljukian line, and governed for fifty-two years a horde\r\nof 400 families. That line of sovereigns had been for a time in alliance\r\nwith the Greek Emperors; but Othman inherited the fanaticism of the\r\ndesert, and, when he succeeded to his father's power, he proclaimed a\r\ngazi, or holy war, against the professors of Christianity. Suddenly,\r\nlike some beast of prey, he managed to leap the mountain heights which\r\nseparated the Greek Province from the Mahomedan conquests, and he\r\npitched himself in Broussa, in Bithynia, which remained from that time\r\nthe Turkish capital, till it was exchanged for Adrianople and\r\nConstantinople. This was the beginning of a long series of\r\nconquests lasting about 270 years, till the Ottomans became one of the\r\nfirst, if not the first power, not only of Asia, but of the world.\r\n\r\nThese conquests were achieved during the reigns of ten great Sultans,\r\nthe average length of whose reigns is as much as twenty-six years, an\r\nunusual period for military sovereigns, and both an evidence of the\r\nstability, and a means of the extension, of their power. Then came the\r\nperiod of their decline, and we are led on through the space of another\r\n270 years, up to our own day, when they seem on the verge of some great\r\nreverse or overthrow. In this second period they have had as many as\r\ntwenty-one Sultans, whose average reigns are only half the length of\r\nthose who preceded them, and afford as cogent an argument of their\r\nnational disorder and demoralization. Of these twenty-one, five have\r\nbeen strangled, three have been deposed, and three have died of excess;\r\nof the remaining ten, four only have attained the age of man, and these\r\ncome together in the course of the last century; two others have died\r\nabout the age of thirty, and three about the age of fifty. The last, the\r\nthirty-first from Othman, is the present Sultan, who came to the throne\r\nas a boy, and is described at that time by an English traveller, as one\r\nof the most \"sickly, pale, inanimate, and unmanly youths he ever\r\nsaw,\"[57] and who has this very year just reached the average length of\r\nthe reign of his twenty predecessors.\r\n\r\nThe names of the Ottoman Sultans are more familiar to us and more easy\r\nto recollect than other Oriental sovereigns, partly from their greater\r\neuphony as Europeans read them, partly from their recurrence again and\r\nagain in the catalogue. There are four Mahomets, four Mustaphas, four\r\nAmuraths or Murads, three Selims, three Achmets, three Othmans, two\r\nMahmoods, two Solimans, and two Bajazets.[58]\r\n\r\nI have already described Othman, the founder of the line, as a soldier\r\nof fortune in the Seljukian service; and, in spite of the civilizing\r\ninfluences of the country, the people, and the religion, to which he had\r\nattached himself, he had not as yet laid aside the habits of his\r\nancestors, but was half shepherd, half freebooter. Nor is it likely that\r\nany of his countrymen would be anything else, as long as they were still\r\nin war and in subordinate posts. Peace must precede the enjoyment, and\r\npower the arts of government; and the very readiness with which his\r\nfollowers left their nomad life, as soon as they had the opportunity,\r\nshows that the means of civilization which they had enjoyed, had not\r\nbeen thrown away on them. The soldiers of Zingis, when laden with booty,\r\nand not till then, cried out to be led back, and would fight no more;\r\nTamerlane, at the end of fifty years, began to be a magnificent king. In\r\nlike manner, Othman observed the life of a Turcoman, till he became a\r\nconqueror; but, as soon as he had crossed Mount Olympus, and found\r\nhimself in the Greek territory as a master, he was both willing and able\r\nto accommodate himself to a pomp and luxury to which a mere Turcoman was\r\nunequal. He bade adieu to his fastnesses in the heights, and he began to\r\nfortify the towns and castles which he had heretofore pillaged. Conquest\r\nand civilization went hand in hand; his successor, Orchan, selected a\r\ncapital, which he ornamented with a mosque, a hospital, a mint, and a\r\ncollege; he introduced professors of the sciences, and, what was as\r\ngreat a departure from Tartar habits, he raised a force of infantry,\r\namong his captives (in anticipation of the Janizaries, formed soon\r\nafter), and he furnished himself with a train of battering engines. More\r\nstrange still, he gained the Greek Emperor's daughter in marriage, a\r\nChristian princess; and lastly, he crossed over into Europe under cover\r\nof friendship to the court of Constantinople, and possessed himself of\r\nGallipoli, the key of the Hellespont. His successors gained first\r\nRoumelia, that is, the country round Constantinople, as far as the\r\nBalkan, with Adrianople for a capital; then they successively swept over\r\nMoldavia, Servia, Bulgaria, Greece, and the Morea. Then they gained a\r\nportion of Hungary; then they took Constantinople, just 400 years ago\r\nthis very year. Meanwhile they had extended their empire into Syria,\r\nEgypt, and along the coast of Africa. And thus at length they more than\r\nhalf encompassed the Mediterranean, from the straits of Gibraltar to the\r\nGulf of Venice, and reigned in three quarters of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\nNow you may ask me, what were Christians doing in Europe all this while?\r\nWhat was the Holy Father about at Rome, if he did not turn his eyes, as\r\nheretofore, on the suffering state of his Asiatic provinces, and oppose\r\nsome rampart to the advance of the enemy upon Constantinople? and how\r\nhas he been the enduring enemy of the Turk, if he acquiesced in the\r\nTurk's long course of victories? Alas! he often looked towards the East,\r\nand often raised the alarm, and often, as I have said, attempted by\r\nmeans of the powers of Christendom, what his mission did not give him\r\narms to do himself. But he was impeded and embarrassed by so many and\r\nsuch various difficulties, that, if I proposed to go through them, I\r\nshould find myself engaged in a history of Europe during those\r\ncenturies. I will suggest some of them, though I can do no more.\r\n\r\n1. First of all, then, I observe generally, that the Pope, in attempting\r\nto save Constantinople and its Empire, was attempting to save a\r\nfanatical people, who had for ages set themselves against the Holy See\r\nand the Latin world, and who had for centuries been under a sentence of\r\nexcommunication. They hated and feared the Catholics, as much as they\r\nhated and feared the Turks, and they contemned them too, for their\r\ncomparative rudeness and ignorance of literature; and this hatred and\r\nfear and contempt were grafted on a cowardly, crafty, insincere, and\r\nfickle character of mind, for which they had been notorious from time\r\nimmemorial. It was impossible to save them without their own cordial\r\ncoöperation; it was impossible to save them in spite of themselves.\r\n\r\nThese odious traits and dispositions had, in the course of the two\r\nhundred years during which the Crusades lasted, borne abundant fruits\r\nand exhibited themselves in results intolerable to the warlike\r\nmultitudes who had come to their assistance. For two hundred years \"each\r\nspring and summer had produced a new emigration of pilgrim warriors for\r\nthe defence of the Holy Land;\"[59] and what had been the effect upon the\r\nGreeks of such prodigality of succour? what satisfaction, what gratitude\r\nhad they shown for an undertaking on the part of the West, which ought\r\nproperly to have been their own, and which the West commenced, because\r\nthe East asked it? When the celebrated Peter the Hermit was in\r\nConstantinople, he would have addressed himself first of all to its\r\nimperial master; and not till the Patriarch of the day showed the\r\nhopelessness of seeking help from a vicious and imbecile court, did he\r\ncry out: \"I will rouse the nations of Europe in your cause.\" The\r\nEmperors sought help themselves instead of lending it. Again and again,\r\nin the course of the Holy Wars, did they selfishly betake themselves to\r\nthe European capitals; and they made their gain of the successes of the\r\nCrusaders, as far as they had opportunity, as the jackal follows the\r\nlion; but from the very first, their pride was wounded, and their\r\ncowardice alarmed, at the sight of their protectors in their city and\r\nprovinces, and they took every means to weaken and annoy the very men\r\nwhom they had invited. In the great council of Placentia, summoned by\r\nUrban the Second, before the Crusades were yet begun, in the presence of\r\n200 Latin Bishops, 4,000 inferior clergy, and 30,000 laity, the\r\nambassadors of the Greek Emperor had been introduced, and they pleaded\r\nthe distress of their sovereign and the danger of their city, which the\r\nmisbelievers already were threatening.[60] They insisted on its being\r\nthe policy of the Latin princes to repel the barbarian in Asia rather\r\nthan when he was in the heart of Europe, and drew such a picture of\r\ntheir own miseries, that the vast assembly burst into tears, and\r\ndismissed them with the assurance of their most zealous coöperation.\r\n\r\nYet what, I say, was the reception which the cowardly suppliants had\r\ngiven to their avengers and protectors? From the very first, they threw\r\ndifficulties in the way of their undertaking. When the heroic Godfrey\r\nand his companions in arms arrived in the neighbourhood of\r\nConstantinople, they found themselves all but betrayed into a dangerous\r\nposition, where they might either have been starved, or been easily\r\nattacked. When at length they had crossed over into Asia, the Crusaders\r\nfound themselves without the means of sustenance. They had bargained for\r\na fair market in the Greek territories; but the Imperial Court allowed\r\nthe cities which they passed by to close their gates upon them, to let\r\ndown to them from the wall an insufficient supply of food, to mix\r\npoisonous ingredients in their bread, to give them base coin, to break\r\ndown the bridges before them, and to fortify the passes, and to mislead\r\nthem by their guides, to give information of their movements to the\r\nTurk, to pillage and murder the stragglers, and to hang up their dead\r\nbodies on gibbets along the highway. The Greek clergy preached against\r\nthem as heretics and schismatics and dogs; the Patriarch and the Bishops\r\nspoke of their extermination as a merit, and their priests washed and\r\npurified the altars where the Latin priests had said mass. Nay, the\r\nEmperors formed a secret alliance with Turks and Saracens against them,\r\nand the price at which they obtained it, was the permission of erecting\r\na mosque in Constantinople.\r\n\r\nAs time went on, they did not stop even here. A number of Latin\r\nmerchants had settled at Constantinople, as our own merchants now are\r\nplanted all over the cities of the Continent. The Greek populace rose\r\nagainst them; and the Emperor did not scruple to send his own troops to\r\naid the rioters. The Latins were slaughtered in their own homes and in\r\nthe streets; their clergy were burned in the churches, their sick in the\r\nhospitals, and their whole quarter reduced to ashes; nay, 4,000 of the\r\nsurvivors were sold into perpetual slavery to the Turks. They cut off\r\nthe head of the Cardinal Legate, and tied it to the tail of a dog, and\r\nthen chanted a _Te Deum_. What could be said to such a people? What\r\ncould be made of them? The Turks might be a more powerful and energetic,\r\nbut could not be a more virulent, a more unscrupulous foe. It did not\r\nseem to matter much to the Latin whether Turk or Greek was lord of\r\nConstantinople; and the Greek justified the indifference of the Latin by\r\ndeclaring that he would rather have the Turban in Constantinople than\r\nthe Tiara.\r\n\r\n2. It is the nature of crime to perpetuate itself, and the atrocities of\r\nthe Greeks brought about a retaliation from the Latins. Twenty years\r\nafter the events I have been relating, the Crusading hosts turned their\r\narms against the Greeks, and besieged and gained possession of\r\nConstantinople; and, though their excesses seem to have been inferior to\r\nthose which provoked them, it is not to be supposed that a city could be\r\ntaken by a rude and angry multitude, without the occurrence of\r\ninnumerable outrages. It was pillaged and disfigured; and the Pope had\r\nto publish an indignant protest against the work of his own adherents\r\nand followers. He might well be alarmed and distressed, not only for the\r\ncrime itself, but for its bearing on the general course of the Crusades;\r\nfor, if it was difficult under any circumstances to keep the Greeks in a\r\nright course, it was doubly difficult, when they had been injured, even\r\nthough they were the original offenders.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\n3. But there were other causes, still less satisfactory than those I\r\nhave mentioned, tending to nullify all the Pope's efforts to make head\r\nagainst the barbarian power. I have said that the period of the Ottoman\r\ngrowth was about 270 years; and this period, viz., the fourteenth and\r\nfifteenth and first half of the sixteenth centuries, was the most\r\ndisastrous and melancholy in the internal history of the Church of any\r\nthat can be named. It was that miserable period, which directly prepared\r\nthe way for Protestantism. The resistance to the Pope's authority, on\r\nthe part of the states of Europe generally, is pretty nearly coincident\r\nwith the rise of the Ottomans. Heresy followed; in the middle of the\r\nfourteenth century, the teaching of Wickliffe gained ground in England;\r\nHuss and others followed on the Continent; and they were succeeded by\r\nLuther. That energy of Popes, those intercessions of holy men, which\r\nhitherto had found matter in the affairs of the East, now found a more\r\nurgent incentive in the troubles which were taking place at home.\r\n\r\n4. The increase of national prosperity and strength, to which the\r\nalienation of kings and states from the Holy See must be ascribed, in\r\nvarious ways indisposed them to the continuance of the war against the\r\nmisbelievers. Rulers and people, who were increasing in wealth, did not\r\nlike to spend their substance on objects both distant and spiritual.\r\nWealth is a present good, and has a tendency to fix the mind on the\r\nvisible and tangible, to the prejudice of both faith and secular policy.\r\nThe rich and happy will not go to war, if they can help it; and trade,\r\nof course, does not care for the religious tenets of those who offer to\r\nenter into relations with it, whether of interchange or of purchase. Nor\r\nwas this all; when nations began to know their own strength, they had a\r\ntendency to be jealous of each other, as well as to be indifferent to\r\nthe interests of religion; and the two most valiant nations of Europe,\r\nFrance and England, gave up the Holy Wars, only to go to war one with\r\nanother. As in the twelfth century, we read of Coeur de Lion in\r\nPalestine, and in the thirteenth, of St. Louis in Egypt, so in the\r\nfourteenth do we read the sad tale of Poitiers and Cressy, and in the\r\nfifteenth of Agincourt. People are apt to ask what good came of the\r\nprowess shown at Ascalon or Damietta; forgetting that they should rather\r\nask themselves what good came of the conquests of our Edwards and\r\nHenries, of which they are so proud. If Richard's prowess ended in his\r\nimprisonment in Germany, and St. Louis died in Africa, yet there is\r\nanother history which ends as ingloriously in the Maid of Orleans, and\r\nthe expulsion of tyrants from a soil they had usurped. In vain did the\r\nPopes attempt to turn the restless destructiveness of the European\r\ncommonwealth into a safer channel. In vain did the Legates of the Holy\r\nSee interpose between Edward of England and the French king; in their\r\nvery presence was a French town delivered over by the English conqueror\r\nto a three days' pillage.[61] In vain did one Pope take a vow of\r\nnever-dying hostility to the Turks; in vain did another, close upon his\r\nend, repair to the fleet, that \"he might, like Moses, raise his hands to\r\nGod during the battle;\"[62] Christian was to war with Christian, not\r\nwith infidel.\r\n\r\nThe suppliant Greek Emperor in one of his begging missions, as they may\r\nbe called, came to England: it was in the reign of Henry the Fourth, but\r\nHenry could do nothing for him. He had usurped the English Crown, and\r\ncould not afford to rescue the Holy Sepulchre, with so precarious a\r\nposition at home. However, he was under some kind of promise to take the\r\nCross, which is signified in the popular story, that he had expected to\r\ndie at Jerusalem, whereas he died in his palace at Westminster instead,\r\nin the Jerusalem chamber. It is said, too, that he was actually\r\nmeditating a Crusade, and had ordered galleys to be prepared, when he\r\ncame to his end.[63] His son, Henry the Fifth, crossed the Channel to\r\nconquer France, just at the very, the only time, when the Ottoman\r\nreverses gave a fair hope of the success of Christendom. When premature\r\ndeath overtook him, and he had but two hours to live,[64] he ordered his\r\nconfessor to recite the Seven Penitential Psalms; and, when the verse\r\nwas read about building the walls of Jerusalem, the word caught his ear;\r\nhe stopped the reader, and observed that he had proposed to conquer\r\nJerusalem, and to have rebuilt it, had God granted him life. Indeed, he\r\nhad already sent a knight to take a survey of the towns and country of\r\nSyria, which is still extant. Alas, that good intentions should only\r\nbecome strong in moments of sickness or of death!\r\n\r\nA like necessary or unnecessary attention, as the case might be, to\r\nnational concerns and private interests, prevailed all over Europe. In\r\nthe same century[65] Charles the Seventh of France forbade the preaching\r\nof a Crusade in his dominions, lest it should lay him open to the\r\nattacks of the English. Alfonso of Portugal promised to join in a Holy\r\nWar, and retracted. Alfonso of Arragon and Sicily took the Cross, and\r\nused the men and money raised for its objects in a war against the\r\nGenoese. The Bohemians would not fight, unless they were paid; and the\r\nGermans affected or felt a fear that the Pope would apply the sums they\r\ncontributed for some other purpose.\r\n\r\n5. Alas! more must be said; it seldom happens that the people go wrong,\r\nwithout the rulers being somewhere in fault, nor is the portion of\r\nhistory to which I am referring an exception. It must be confessed that,\r\nat the very time the Turks were making progress, the Christian world was\r\nin a more melancholy state than it had ever been either before or since.\r\nThe sins of nations were accumulating that heavy judgment which fell\r\nupon them in the Ottoman conquests and the Reformation. There were great\r\nscandals among Bishops and Priests, as well as heresy and\r\ninsubordination. As to the Pontiffs who filled the Holy See during that\r\nperiod, I will say no more than this, that it did not please the good\r\nProvidence of God to raise up for His Church such heroic men as St.\r\nLeo, of the fifth, and St. Gregory, of the eleventh century. For a time\r\nthe Popes removed from Italy to France; then, when they returned to\r\nRome, there was a schism in the Papacy for nearly forty years, during\r\nwhich time the populations of Europe were perplexed to find the real\r\nsuccessor of St. Peter, or even took the pretended Pope for the true\r\none.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.\r\n\r\nSuch was the condition of Christendom, thus destitute of resources, thus\r\nweakened by internal quarrels, thus bribed and retained (so to speak) by\r\nthe temptations of the world, at the very time when the Ottomans were\r\npressing on its outposts. One moment occurred, and just one, in their\r\nhistory, when they might have been resisted with success. You will\r\nrecollect that the Seljukians were broken, not simply by the Crusaders,\r\nbut also, though not so early, by the terrible Zingis. What Zingis was\r\nto the Seljukians, such, and more than such, was Timour to the Ottomans.\r\nIt was in their full career of victory, and when everything seemed in\r\ntheir power, when they had gained the whole province of Roumelia, which\r\nis round about Constantinople, that a terrible reverse befell them. The\r\nSultan then on the throne was Bajazet, surnamed Ilderim, or the\r\nLightning, from the rapidity of his movements. He had extended his\r\nempire, or his sensible influence, from the Carpathians to the\r\nEuphrates; he had destroyed the remains of rival dynasties in Asia\r\nMinor, had carried his arms down to the Morea, and utterly routed an\r\nallied Christian army in Hungary. Elated with these successes, he put no\r\nbounds to his pride and ambition. He vaunted that he would subdue, not\r\nHungary only, but Germany and Italy besides; and that he would feed his\r\nhorse with a bushel of oats on the altar of St. Peter's, at Rome. The\r\nApostle heard the blasphemy; and this mighty conqueror was not suffered\r\nto leave this world for his eternal habitation without Divine infliction\r\nin evidence that He who made him, could unmake him at His will. The\r\nDisposer of all things sent against him the fierce Timour, of whom I\r\nhave already said so much. One would have thought the two conquerors\r\ncould not possibly have come into collision--Timour, the Lord of Persia,\r\nKhorasan, Sogdiana, and Hindostan, and Bajazet, the Sultan of Syria,\r\nAsia Minor, and Greece. They were both Mahomedans; they might have\r\nturned their backs on each other, if they were jealous of each other,\r\nand might have divided the world between them. Bajazet might have gone\r\nforward towards Germany and Italy, and Timour might have stretched his\r\nconquests into China.\r\n\r\nBut ambition is a spirit of envy as well as of covetousness; neither of\r\nthem could brook a rival greatness. Timour was on the Ganges, and\r\nBajazet was besieging Constantinople, when they interchanged the words\r\nof hatred and defiance. Timour called Bajazet a pismire, whom he would\r\ncrush with his elephants; and Bajazet retaliated with a worse insult on\r\nTimour, by promising that he would capture his retinue of wives. The\r\nfoes met at Angora in Asia Minor; Bajazet was defeated and captured in\r\nthe battle, and Timour secured him in an iron-barred apartment or cage,\r\nwhich, according to Tartar custom, was on wheels, and he carried him\r\nabout, as some wild beast, on his march through Asia. Can imagination\r\ninvent a more intolerable punishment upon pride? is it not wonderful\r\nthat the victim of it was able to live as many as nine months under such\r\na visitation?\r\n\r\nThis was at the beginning of the fifteenth century, shortly before young\r\nHarry of Monmouth, the idol of English poetry and loyalty, crossed the\r\nsea to kill the French at Agincourt; and an opportunity was offered to\r\nChristendom to destroy an enemy, who never before or since has been in\r\nsuch extremity of peril. For fourteen years a state of interregnum, or\r\ncivil war, lasted in the Ottoman empire; and the capture of\r\nConstantinople, which was imminent at the time of Bajazet's downfall,\r\nwas anyhow delayed for full fifty years. Had a crusade been attempted\r\nwith the matured experience and subdued enthusiasm, which the trials of\r\nthree hundred years had given to the European nations, the Ottomans,\r\naccording to all human probability, would have perished, as the\r\nSeljukians before them. But, in the inscrutable decree of Heaven, no\r\nsuch attempt was made; one attempt indeed was made too soon, and a\r\nsecond attempt was made too late, but none at the time.\r\n\r\n1. The first of these two was set on foot when Bajazet was in the full\r\ntide of his victories; and he was able, not only to defeat it, but, by\r\ndefeating, to damp the hopes, and by anticipation, to stifle the\r\nefforts, which might have been used against him with better effect in\r\nthe day of his reverses. In the year 1394, eight years before Bajazet's\r\nmisfortunes, Pope Boniface the Ninth proclaimed a Crusade, with ample\r\nindulgences for those who engaged in it, to the countries which were\r\nespecially open to the Ottoman attack. In his Bull, he bewails the sins\r\nof Christendom, which had brought upon them that scourge which was the\r\noccasion of his invitation. He speaks of the massacres, the tortures,\r\nand slavery which had been inflicted on multitudes of the faithful. \"The\r\nmind is horrified,\" he says, \"at the very mention of these miseries; but\r\nit crowns our anguish to reflect, that the whole of Christendom, which,\r\nif in concord, might put an end to these and even greater evils, is\r\neither in open war, country with country, or, if in apparent peace, is\r\nsecretly wasted by mutual jealousies and animosities.\"[66]\r\n\r\nThe Pontiff's voice, aided by the imminent peril of Hungary and its\r\nneighbouring kingdoms, was successful. Not only from Germany, but even\r\nfrom France, the bravest knights, each a fortress in himself, or a\r\nman-of-war on land (as he may be called), came forward in answer to his\r\ncall, and boasted that, even were the sky to fall, they would uphold its\r\ncanopy upon the points of their lances. They formed the flower of the\r\narmy of 100,000 men, who rallied round the King of Hungary in the great\r\nbattle of Nicopolis. The Turk was victorious; the greater part of the\r\nChristian army were slain or driven into the Danube; and a part of the\r\nFrench chivalry of the highest rank were made prisoners. Among these\r\nwere the son of the Duke of Burgundy; the Sire de Coucy, who had great\r\npossessions in France and England; the Marshal of France (Boucicault),\r\nwho afterwards fell on the field of Agincourt; and four French princes\r\nof the blood. Bajazet spared twenty-five of his noblest prisoners, whom\r\ntheir wealth and station made it politic to except; then, summoning the\r\nrest before his throne, he offered them the famous choice of the Koran\r\nor the sword. As they came up one by one, they one by one professed\r\ntheir faith in Christ, and were beheaded in the Sultan's presence. His\r\nroyal and noble captives he carried about with him in his march through\r\nEurope and Asia, as he himself was soon to grace the retinue of Timour.\r\nTwo of the most illustrious of them died in prison in Asia. As to the\r\nrest, he exacted a heavy ransom from them; but, before he sent them\r\naway, he gave them a grand entertainment, which displayed both the\r\nbarbarism and the magnificence of the Asiatic. He exhibited before them\r\nhis hunting and hawking equipage, amounting to seven thousand huntsmen\r\nand as many falconers; and, when one of his chamberlains was accused\r\nbefore him of drinking a poor woman's goat's milk, he literally\r\nfulfilled the \"castigat auditque\" of the poet, by having the unhappy man\r\nripped open, in order to find in his inside the evidence of the charge.\r\n\r\nSuch was the disastrous issue of the battle of Nicopolis; nor is it\r\nwonderful that it should damp the zeal of the Christians and weaken the\r\ninfluence of the Pope, for a long time to come; anyhow, it had this\r\neffect till the critical moment of the Turkish misfortunes was over, and\r\nthe race of Othman was recovering itself after the captivity and death\r\nof its Sultan. \"Whereas the Turks might have been expelled from Greece\r\non the loss of their Sultan,\" says Rainaldus, \"Christians, torn to\r\npieces by their quarrels and by schism, lost a fit and sufficient\r\nopportunity. Whence it followed, that the wound inflicted upon the beast\r\nwas not unto death, but he revived more ferocious for the devouring of\r\nthe faithful.\"\r\n\r\n2. However, Christendom made a second attempt still, but when it was too\r\nlate. The grandson of Bajazet was then on the throne, one of the ablest\r\nof the Sultans; and, though the allied Christian army had considerable\r\nsuccess against him at first, in vain was the bravery of Hunniades, and\r\nthe preaching of St. John Capistran: the Turk managed to negotiate with\r\nits leaders, to put them in the wrong, to charge them with perjury, and\r\nthen to beat them in the fatal battle of Varna, in which the King of\r\nHungary and Poland and the Pope's Legate were killed, with 10,000 men.\r\nIn vain after this was any attempt to make head against the enemy; in\r\nvain did Pope after Pope raise his warning voice and point to the\r\njudgment which hung over Christendom; Constantinople fell.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.\r\n\r\nThus things did but go on worse and worse for the interest of\r\nChristendom. Even the taking of Constantinople was not the limit of the\r\nOttoman successes. Mahomet the Conqueror, as he is called, was but the\r\nseventh of the great Sultans, who carried on the fortunes of the\r\nbarbarian empire. An eighth, a ninth followed. The ninth, Selim,\r\nreturned from his Eastern conquests with the last of the Caliphs in his\r\ncompany, and made him resign to himself the prerogatives of Pontiff and\r\nLawgiver, which the Caliph inherited from Mahomet. Then came a tenth,\r\nthe greatest perhaps of all, Soliman the Magnificent, the contemporary\r\nof the Emperor Charles, Francis the First of France, and Henry the\r\nEighth of England. And an eleventh might have been expected, and a\r\ntwelfth, and the power of the enemy would have become greater and\r\ngreater, and would have afflicted the Church more and more heavily; and\r\nwhat was to be the end of these things? What was to be the end? why, not\r\na Christian only, but any philosopher of this world would have known\r\nwhat was to be the end, in spite of existing appearances. All earthly\r\npower has an end; it rises to fall, it grows to die; and the depth of\r\nits humiliation issues out of the pride of its lifting up. This is what\r\neven a philosopher would say; he would not know whether Soliman, the\r\ntenth conqueror, was also to be the last; but if not the tenth, he would\r\nbe bold to say it would be the twelfth, who would close their victories,\r\nor the fifteenth, or the twentieth. But what a philosopher could not\r\nsay, what a Christian knows and enjoys, is this, that one earthly power\r\nthere is which is something more than earthly, and which, while it dies\r\nin the individual, for he is human, is immortal in its succession, for\r\nit is divine.\r\n\r\nIt was a remarkable question addressed by the savage Tartars of Zingis\r\nto the missionaries whom the Pope sent them in the thirteenth century:\r\n\"Who was the Pope?\" they asked; \"was he not an old man, five hundred\r\nyears of age?\"[67] It was their one instinctive notion of the religion\r\nof the West; and the Turks in their own history have often had cause to\r\nlament over its truth. Togrul Beg first looked towards the West, in the\r\nyear 1048; twenty years later, between the years 1068 and 1074,[68] his\r\nsuccessor, Malek Shah, attracted the attention of the great St. Gregory\r\nthe Seventh. Time went on; they were thrown back by the impetuosity of\r\nthe Crusaders; they returned to the attack. Fresh and fresh multitudes\r\npoured down from Turkistan; the furious deluge of the Tartars under\r\nZingis spread itself and disappeared; the Turks sunk in it, but emerged;\r\nthe race seemed indestructible; then Othman began a new career of\r\nvictory, as if there had never been an old one, and founded an empire,\r\nmore stable, more coherent than any Turkish rule before it. Then\r\nfollowed Sultan after Sultan, each greater than his predecessor, while\r\nthe line of Popes had indeed many bright names to show, Pontiffs of\r\nlearning, and of piety, and of genius, and of zeal and energy; but still\r\nwhere was the destined champion of Christendom, the holy, the\r\ninflexible, the lion-hearted, the successor of St. Gregory, who in a\r\nluxurious and a self-willed age, among his other high duties and\r\nachievements, had the mission, by his prayers and by his efforts, of\r\nstopping the enemy in his full career, and of rescuing Catholicism from\r\nthe pollution of the blasphemer? The five hundred years were not yet\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\nBut the five hundred years at length were run out; the long-expected\r\nchampion was at hand. He appeared at the very time when the Ottoman\r\ncrescent had passed its zenith and was beginning to descend the sky. The\r\nTurkish successes began in the middle of the eleventh century; they\r\nended in the middle of the sixteenth; in the middle of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, just five hundred years after St. Gregory and Malek Shah, Selim\r\nthe Sot came to the throne of Othman, and St. Pius the Fifth to the\r\nthrone of the Apostle; Pius became Pope in 1566, and Selim became Sultan\r\nin that very same year.\r\n\r\nO what a strange contrast, Gentlemen, did Rome and Constantinople\r\npresent at that era! Neither was what it had been, but they had changed\r\nin opposite directions. Both had been the seat of Imperial Power; Rome,\r\nwhere heresy never throve, had exchanged its Emperors for the succession\r\nof St. Peter and St. Paul; Constantinople had passed from secular\r\nsupremacy into schism, and thence into a blasphemous apostasy. The\r\nunhappy city, which with its subject provinces had been successively the\r\nseat of Arianism, of Nestorianism, of Photianism, now had become the\r\nmetropolis of the false Prophet; and, while in the West the great\r\nedifice of the Vatican Basilica was rising anew in its wonderful\r\nproportions and its costly materials, the Temple of St. Sophia in the\r\nEast was degraded into a Mosque! O the strange contrast in the state of\r\nthe inhabitants of each place! Here in the city of Constantine a\r\nGod-denying misbelief was accompanied by an impure, man-degrading rule\r\nof life, by the slavery of woman, and the corruption of youth. But\r\nthere, in the city which Apostles had consecrated with their blood, the\r\ngreat and true reformation of the age was in full progress. There the\r\ndeterminations in doctrine and discipline of the great Council of Trent\r\nhad lately been promulgated. There for twenty years past had laboured\r\nour own dear saint, St. Philip, till he earned the title of Apostle of\r\nRome, and yet had still nearly thirty years of life and work in him.\r\nThere, too, the romantic royal-minded saint, Ignatius Loyola, had but\r\nlately died. And there, when the Holy See fell vacant, and a Pope had to\r\nbe appointed in the great need of the Church, a saint was present in the\r\nconclave to find in it a brother saint, and to recommend him for the\r\nChair of St. Peter, to the suffrages of the Fathers and Princes of the\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\n\r\n7.\r\n\r\nSt Carlo Borromeo,[69] the Cardinal Archbishop of Milan, was the nephew\r\nof the Pope who was just dead, and though he was only twenty-five years\r\nof age at the time, nevertheless, by the various influences arising out\r\nof the position which he held, and from the weight attached to his\r\npersonal character, he might be considered to sway the votes of the\r\nCollege of Cardinals, and to determine the election of a new Pontiff. It\r\nis remarkable that Cardinal Alessandrino, as St. Pius was then called,\r\n(from Alexandria, in North Italy, near which he was born,) was not the\r\nfirst object of his choice. His eyes were first turned on Cardinal\r\nMorone, who was in many respects the most illustrious of the Sacred\r\nCollege, and had served the Church on various occasions with great\r\ndevotion, and with distinguished success. From his youth he had been\r\nreared up in public affairs, he had held many public offices, he had\r\ngreat influence with the German Emperor, he had been Apostolical Legate\r\nat the Council of Trent. He had great virtue, judgment, experience, and\r\nsagacity. Such, then, was the choice of St. Carlo, and the votes were\r\ntaken; but it seemed otherwise to the Holy Ghost. He wanted four to\r\nmake up the sufficient number of votes. St. Carlo had to begin again;\r\nand again, strange to say, the Cardinal Alessandrino still was not his\r\nchoice. He chose Cardinal Sirleto, a man most opposite in character and\r\nhistory to Morone. He was not nobly born, he was no man of the world, he\r\nhad ever been urgent with the late Pope not to make him Cardinal. He was\r\na first-rate scholar in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin; versed in the\r\nScriptures, ready as a theologian. Moreover, he was of a character most\r\nunblemished, of most innocent life, and of manners most popular and\r\nwinning. St. Pius as well as St. Carlo advocated the cause of Cardinal\r\nSirleto, and the votes were given a second time; a second time they came\r\nshort. It was like holy Samuel choosing Eliab instead of David. Then\r\nmatters were in confusion; one name and another were mentioned, and no\r\nprogress was made.\r\n\r\nAt length and at last, and not till all others were thought of who could\r\nenter into the minds of the electors, the Cardinal Alessandrino himself\r\nbegan to attract attention. He seems not to have been known to the\r\nFathers of the conclave in general; a Dominican Friar, of humble rank,\r\never taken up in the duties of his rule and his special employments,\r\nliving in his cell, knowing little or nothing of mankind--such a one St.\r\nCarlo, the son of a prince and the nephew of a Pope, had no means of\r\nknowing; and the intimacy, consequent on their coöperation in behalf of\r\nCardinal Sirleto, was the first real introduction which the one Saint\r\nhad to the other. It was just at this moment that our own St. Philip was\r\nin his small room at St. Girolamo, with Marcello Ferro, one of his\r\nspiritual children, when, lifting up his eyes to heaven, and going\r\nalmost into an ecstasy, he said: \"The Pope will be elected on Monday.\"\r\nOn one of the following days, as they were walking together, Marcello\r\nasked him who was to be Pope. Philip answered, \"Come, I will tell you;\r\nthe Pope will be one whom you have never thought of, and whom no one has\r\nspoken of as likely; and that is Cardinal Alessandrino; and he will be\r\nelected on Monday evening without fail.\" The event accomplished the\r\nprediction; the statesman and the man of the world, the accomplished and\r\nexemplary and amiable scholar, were put aside to make way for the Saint.\r\nHe took the name of Pius.\r\n\r\nI am far from denying that St. Pius was stern and severe, as far as a\r\nheart burning within and melting with the fulness of divine love could\r\nbe so; and this was the reason that the conclave was so slow in electing\r\nhim. Yet such energy and vigour as his was necessary for his times. He\r\nwas emphatically a soldier of Christ in a time of insurrection and\r\nrebellion, when, in a spiritual sense, martial law was proclaimed. St.\r\nPhilip, a private priest, might follow his bent, in casting his net for\r\nsouls, as he expressed himself, and enticing them to the truth; but the\r\nVicar of Christ had to right and to steer the vessel, when it was in\r\nrough waters, and among breakers. A Protestant historian on this point\r\ndoes justice to him. \"When Pope,\" he says, \"he lived in all the\r\nausterity of his monastic life, fasted with the utmost rigour and\r\npunctuality, would wear no finer garments than before ... arose at an\r\nextremely early hour in the morning, and took no _siesta_. If we doubted\r\nthe depth of his religious earnestness, we may find a proof of it in his\r\ndeclaration, that the Papacy was unfavourable to his advance in piety;\r\nthat it did not contribute to his salvation and to his attainment of\r\nParadise; and that, but for prayer, the burden had been too heavy for\r\nhim. The happiness of a fervent devotion, which often moved him to\r\ntears, was granted him to the end of his life. The people were excited\r\nto enthusiasm, when they saw him walking in procession, barefooted and\r\nbareheaded, with the expression of unaffected piety in his countenance,\r\nand with his long snow-white beard falling on his breast. They thought\r\nthere had never been so pious a Pope; they told each other how his very\r\nlook had converted heretics. Pius was kind, too, and affable; his\r\nintercourse with his old servants was of the most confidential kind. At\r\na former period, before he was Pope, the Count della Trinità had\r\nthreatened to have him thrown into a well, and he had replied, that it\r\nmust be as God pleased. How beautiful was his greeting to this same\r\nCount, who was now sent as ambassador to his court! 'See,' said he, when\r\nhe recognized him, 'how God preserves the innocent.' This was the only\r\nway in which he made him feel that he recollected his enmity. He had\r\never been most charitable and bounteous; he kept a list of the poor of\r\nRome, whom he regularly assisted according to their station and their\r\nwants.\" The writer, after proceeding to condemn what he considers his\r\nseverity, ends thus: \"It is certain that his deportment and mode of\r\nthinking exercised an incalculable influence on his contemporaries, and\r\non the general development of the Church of which he was the head. After\r\nso many circumstances had concurred to excite and foster a religious\r\nspirit, after so many resolutions and measures had been taken to exalt\r\nit to universal dominion, a Pope like this was needed, not only to\r\nproclaim it to the world, but also to reduce it to practice; his zeal\r\nand his example combined produced the most powerful effect.\"[70]\r\n\r\n\r\n8.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed that a Saint on whom lay the \"solicitude of\r\nall the churches,\" should neglect the tradition, which his predecessors\r\nof so many centuries had bequeathed to him, of zeal and hostility\r\nagainst the Turkish power. He was only six years on the Pontifical\r\nthrone; and the achievement of which I am going to speak was among his\r\nlast; he died the following year. At this time the Ottoman armies were\r\ncontinuing their course of victory; they had just taken Cyprus, with the\r\nactive coöperation of the Greek population of the island, and were\r\nmassacring the Latin nobility and clergy, and mutilating and flaying\r\nalive the Venetian governor. Yet the Saint found it impossible to move\r\nChristendom to its own defence. How, indeed, was that to be done, when\r\nhalf Christendom had become Protestant, and secretly perhaps felt as the\r\nGreeks felt, that the Turk was its friend and ally? In such a quarrel\r\nEngland, France, and Germany were out of the question. At length,\r\nhowever, with great effort, he succeeded in forming a holy league\r\nbetween himself, King Philip of Spain, and the Venetians. Don John, of\r\nAustria, King Philip's half brother, was appointed commander-in-chief of\r\nthe forces, and Colonna admiral. The treaty was signed on the 24th of\r\nMay; but such was the cowardice and jealousy of the parties concerned,\r\nthat the autumn had arrived, and nothing of importance was accomplished.\r\nWith difficulty were the armies united; with difficulty were the\r\ndissensions of the commanders brought to a settlement. Meanwhile, the\r\nOttomans were scouring the Gulf of Venice, blockading the ports, and\r\nterrifying the city itself.\r\n\r\nBut the holy Pope was securing the success of his cause by arms of his\r\nown, which the Turks understood not. He had been appointing a Triduo of\r\nsupplication at Rome, and had taken part in the procession himself. He\r\nhad proclaimed a jubilee to the whole Christian world, for the happy\r\nissue of the war. He had been interesting the Holy Virgin in his cause.\r\nHe presented to his admiral, after High Mass in his chapel, a standard\r\nof red damask, embroidered with a crucifix, and with the figures of St.\r\nPeter and St. Paul, and the legend, \"_In hoc signo vinces_.\" Next,\r\nsending to Messina, where the allied fleet lay, he assured the\r\ngeneral-in-chief and the armament, that \"if, relying on divine, rather\r\nthan on human help, they attacked the enemy, God would not be wanting to\r\nHis own cause. He augured a prosperous and happy issue; not on any light\r\nor random hope, but on a divine guidance, and by the anticipations of\r\nmany holy men.\" Moreover, he enjoined the officers to look to the good\r\nconduct of their troops; to repress swearing, gaming, riot, and plunder,\r\nand thereby to render them more deserving of victory. Accordingly, a\r\nfast of three days was proclaimed for the fleet, beginning with the\r\nNativity of our Lady; all the men went to confession and communion, and\r\nappropriated to themselves the plentiful indulgences which the Pope\r\nattached to the expedition. Then they moved across the foot of Italy to\r\nCorfu, with the intention of presenting themselves at once to the enemy;\r\nbeing disappointed in their expectations, they turned back to the Gulf\r\nof Corinth; and there at length, on the 7th of October, they found the\r\nTurkish fleet, half way between Lepanto and the Echinades on the North,\r\nand Patras, in the Morea, on the South; and, though it was towards\r\nevening, strong in faith and zeal, they at once commenced the\r\nengagement.\r\n\r\nThe night before the battle, and the day itself, aged as he was, and\r\nbroken with a cruel malady, the Saint had passed in the Vatican in\r\nfasting and prayer. All through the Holy City the monasteries and the\r\ncolleges were in prayer too. As the evening advanced, the Pontifical\r\ntreasurer asked an audience of the Sovereign Pontiff on an important\r\nmatter. Pius was in his bedroom, and began to converse with him; when\r\nsuddenly he stopped the conversation, left him, threw open the window,\r\nand gazed up into heaven. Then closing it again, he looked gravely at\r\nhis official, and said, \"This is no time for business; go, return thanks\r\nto the Lord God. In this very hour our fleet has engaged the Turkish,\r\nand is victorious.\" As the treasurer went out, he saw him fall on his\r\nknees before the altar in thankfulness and joy.\r\n\r\nAnd a most memorable victory it was: upwards of 30,000 Turks are said to\r\nhave lost their lives in the engagement, and 3,500 were made prisoners.\r\nAlmost their whole fleet was taken. I quote from Protestant authorities\r\nwhen I say that the Sultan, on the news of the calamity, neither ate,\r\nnor drank, nor showed himself, nor saw any one for three days; that it\r\nwas the greatest blow which the Ottomans had had since Timour's victory\r\nover Bajazet, a century and a half before; nay, that it was the\r\nturning-point in the Turkish history;[71] and that, though the Sultans\r\nhave had isolated successes since, yet from that day they undeniably and\r\nconstantly declined, that they have lost their _prestige_ and their\r\nself-confidence, and that the victories gained over them since are but\r\nthe complements and the reverberations of the overthrow at Lepanto.\r\n\r\nSuch was the catastrophe of this long and anxious drama; the hosts of\r\nTurkistan and Tartary had poured down from their wildernesses through\r\nages, to be withstood, and foiled, and reversed by an old man. It was a\r\nrepetition, though under different circumstances, of the history of Leo\r\nand the Hun. In the contrast between the combatants we see the contrast\r\nof the histories of good and evil. The Enemy, as the Turks in this\r\nbattle, rushing forward with the terrible fury of wild beasts; and the\r\nChurch, ever combating with the energetic perseverance and the heroic\r\nobstinacy of St. Pius.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[57] Formby's Visit to the East.\r\n\r\n[58] The three remaining of the thirty are Orchan, Ibrahim, and Abdoul\r\nAchmet.\r\n\r\n[59] Gibbon.\r\n\r\n[60] Gibbon.\r\n\r\n[61] Hume's History.\r\n\r\n[62] Ranke, vol. i\r\n\r\n[63] Turner's History.\r\n\r\n[64] Ibid.\r\n\r\n[65] Gieseler's Text Book.\r\n\r\n[66] Baronius.\r\n\r\n[67] Bergeron.\r\n\r\n[68] Gibbon says twenty years: Sharon Turner gives 1074.\r\n\r\n[69] Bollandist.

I have not been led to speak of them by any\r\nespecial interest in them for their own sake, but by the circumstances\r\nof the present moment, which bring them often before us, oblige us to\r\nspeak of them, and involve the necessity of entertaining some definite\r\nsentiments about them. With this view I have been considering their\r\nantecedents; whence they came, how they came, where they are, and what\r\ntitle they have to be there at all. When I now say, that I am proceeding\r\nto contemplate their future, do not suppose me to be so rash as to be\r\nhazarding any political prophecy; I do but mean to set down some\r\ncharacteristics in their existing state (if I have any right to fancy,\r\nthat in any true measure we at the distance of some thousand miles know\r\nit), which naturally suggest to us to pursue their prospective history\r\nin one direction, not in another.\r\n\r\nNow it seems safe to say, in the first place, that some time or other\r\nthe Ottomans will come to an end. All human power has its termination\r\nsooner or later; states rise to fall; and, secure as they may be now, so\r\none day they will be in peril and in course of overthrow. Nineveh, Tyre,\r\nBabylon, Persia, Egypt, and Greece, each has had its day; and this was\r\nso clear to mankind 2,000 years ago, that the conqueror of Carthage\r\nwept, as he gazed upon its flames, for he saw in them the conflagration\r\nof her rival, his own Rome. \"_Fuit Ilium._\" The Saracens, the Moguls,\r\nhave had their day; those European states, so great three centuries ago,\r\nSpain and Poland, Venice and Genoa, are now either extinct or in\r\ndecrepitude. What is the lot of all states, is still more strikingly\r\nfulfilled in the case of empires; kingdoms indeed are of slow growth,\r\nbut empires commonly are but sudden manifestations of power, which are\r\nas short-lived as they are sudden. Even the Roman empire, which is an\r\nexception, did not last beyond five hundred years; the Saracenic three\r\nhundred; the Spanish three hundred; the Russian has lasted about a\r\nhundred and fifty, that is, since the Czar Peter; the British not a\r\nhundred; the Ottoman has reached four or five. If there be an empire\r\nwhich does not at all feel the pressure of this natural law, but lasts\r\ncontinuously, repairs its losses, renews its vigour, and with every\r\nsuccessive age emulates its antecedent fame, such a power must be more\r\nthan human, and has no place in our present inquiry. We are concerned,\r\nnot with any supernatural power, to which is promised perpetuity, but\r\nwith the Ottoman empire, famous in history, vigorous in constitution,\r\nbut, after all, human, and nothing more. There is, then, neither risk\r\nnor merit in prophesying the eventual fall of the Osmanlis, as of the\r\nSeljukians, as of the Gaznevides before them; the only wonder is that\r\nthey actually have lasted as much as four hundred years.\r\n\r\nSuch will be the issue and the sum of their whole history; but, certain\r\nas this is, and confidently as it may be pronounced, nothing else can be\r\nprudently asserted about their future. Times and moments are in the\r\ndecrees of the All-wise, and known to Him alone; and so are the\r\noccurrences to which they give birth. The only further point open to\r\nconjecture, as being not quite destitute of data for speculating upon\r\nit, is the particular course of events and quality of circumstances,\r\nwhich will precede the downfall of the Turkish power; for, granting that\r\nthat downfall is to come, it is reasonable to think it will take place\r\nin that particular way, for which in their present state we see an\r\nexisting preparation, if such can be discerned, or in a way which at\r\nleast is not inconsistent with the peculiarities of that present state.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\nHence, in speculating on this question, I shall take this as a\r\nreasonable assumption first of all, that the catastrophe of a state is\r\naccording to its antecedents, and its destiny according to its nature;\r\nand therefore, that we cannot venture on any anticipation of the\r\ninstruments or the conditions of its death, until we know something\r\nabout the principle and the character of its life. Next I lay down,\r\nthat, whereas a state is in its very idea a society, and a society is a\r\ncollection of many individuals made one by their participation in some\r\ncommon possession, and to the extent of that common possession, the\r\npresence of that possession held in common constitutes the life, and the\r\nloss of it constitutes the dissolution, of a state. In like manner,\r\nwhatever avails or tends to withdraw that common possession, is either\r\nfatal or prejudicial to the social union. As regards the Ottoman power,\r\nthen, we have to inquire what its life consists in, and what are the\r\ndangers to which that life, from the nature of its constitution, is\r\nexposed.\r\n\r\nNow, states may be broadly divided into _barbarous_ and _civilized_;\r\ntheir common possession, or life, is some object either of _sense_ or of\r\n_imagination_; and their bane and destruction is either _external_ or\r\n_internal_. And, to speak in general terms, without allowing for\r\nexceptions or limitations (for I am treating the subject scientifically\r\nonly so far as is requisite for my particular inquiry), we may pronounce\r\nthat _barbarous_ states live in a common _imagination_, and are\r\ndestroyed _from without_; whereas _civilized_ states live in some common\r\nobject of _sense_, and are destroyed from _within_.\r\n\r\nBy _external_ enemies I mean foreign wars, foreign influence,\r\ninsurrection of slaves or of subject races, famine, accidental\r\nenormities of individuals in power, and other instruments analogous to\r\nwhat, in the case of an individual, is called a violent death; by\r\n_internal_ I mean civil contention, excessive changes, revolution, decay\r\nof public spirit, which may be considered analogous to natural death.\r\n\r\nAgain, by objects of _imagination_, I mean such as religion, true or\r\nfalse (for there are not only false imaginations but true), divine\r\nmission of a sovereign or of a dynasty, and historical fame; and by\r\nobjects of _sense_, such as secular interests, country, home, protection\r\nof person and property.\r\n\r\nI do not allude to the conservative power of habit when I speak of the\r\nsocial bond, because habit is rather the necessary result of possessing\r\na common object, and protects all states equally, barbarous and\r\ncivilized. Nor do I include moral degeneracy among the instruments of\r\ntheir destruction, because this too attaches to all states, civilized\r\nand barbarous, and is rather a disposition exposing them to the\r\ninfluence of what is their bane, than a direct cause of their ruin in\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\nBut what is meant by the words _barbarous_ and _civilized_, as applied\r\nto political bodies? this is a question which it will take more time to\r\nanswer, even if I succeed in satisfying it at all. By \"barbarism,\" then,\r\nI suppose, in itself is meant a state of nature; and by \"civilization,\"\r\na state of mental cultivation and discipline. In a state of nature man\r\nhas reason, conscience, affections, and passions, and he uses these\r\nseverally, or rather is influenced by them, according to circumstances;\r\nand whereas they do not one and all necessarily move in the same\r\ndirection, he takes no great pains to make them agree together, but lets\r\nthem severally take their course, and, if I may so speak, jostle into a\r\nsort of union, and get on together, as best they can. He does not\r\nimprove his talents; he does not simplify and fix his motives; he does\r\nnot put his impulses under the control of principle, or form his mind\r\nupon a rule. He grows up pretty much what he was when a child;\r\ncapricious, wayward, unstable, idle, irritable, excitable; with not much\r\nmore of habituation than that which experience of living unconsciously\r\nforces even on the brutes. Brutes act upon instinct, not on reason; they\r\nare ferocious when they are hungry; they fiercely indulge their\r\nappetite; they gorge themselves; they fall into torpor and inactivity.\r\nIn a like, but a more human way, the savage is drawn by the object held\r\nup to him, as if he could not help following it; an excitement rushes on\r\nhim, and he yields to it without a struggle; he acts according to the\r\nmoment, without regard to consequences; he is energetic or slothful,\r\ntempestuous or calm, as the winds blow or the sun shines. He is one\r\nbeing to-day, another to-morrow, as if he were simply the sport of\r\ninfluences or circumstances. If he is raised somewhat above this extreme\r\nstate of barbarism, just one idea or feeling occupies the narrow range\r\nof his thoughts, to the exclusion of others.\r\n\r\nMoreover, brutes differ from men in this; that they cannot invent,\r\ncannot progress. They remain in the use of those faculties and methods,\r\nwhich nature gave them at their birth. They are endowed by the law of\r\ntheir being with certain weapons of defence, and they do not improve on\r\nthem. They have food, raiment, and dwelling, ready at their command.\r\nThey need no arrow or noose to catch their prey, nor kitchen to dress\r\nit; no garment to wrap round them, nor roof to shelter them. Their\r\nclaws, their teeth, their viscera, are their butcher and their cook; and\r\ntheir fur is their wardrobe. The cave or the jungle is their home; or if\r\nit is their nature to exercise some architectural craft, they have not\r\nto learn it. But man comes into the world with the capabilities, rather\r\nthan the means and appliances, of life. He begins with a small capital,\r\nbut one which admits of indefinite improvement. He is, in his very idea,\r\na creature of progress. He starts, the inferior of the brute animals,\r\nbut he surpasses them in the long run; he subjects them to himself, and\r\nhe goes forward on a career, which at least hitherto has not found its\r\nlimit.\r\n\r\nEven the savage of course in some measure exemplifies this law of human\r\nnature, and is lord of the brutes; and what he is and man is generally,\r\ncompared with the inferior animals, such is man civilized compared with\r\nthe barbarian. Civilization is that state to which man's nature points\r\nand tends; it is the systematic use, improvement, and combination of\r\nthose faculties which are his characteristic; and, viewed in its idea,\r\nit is the perfection, the happiness of our mortal state. It is the\r\ndevelopment of art out of nature, and of self-government out of passion,\r\nand of certainty out of opinion, and of faith out of reason. It is the\r\ndue disposition of the various powers of the soul, each in its place,\r\nthe subordination or subjection of the inferior, and the union of all\r\ninto one whole. Aims, rules, views, habits, projects; prudence,\r\nforesight, observation, inquiry, invention, resource, resolution,\r\nperseverance, are its characteristics. Justice, benevolence, expedience,\r\npropriety, religion, are its recognized, its motive principles.\r\nSupernatural truth is its sovereign law. Such is it in its true idea,\r\nsynonymous with Christianity; and, not only in idea, but in matter of\r\nfact also, is Christianity ever civilization, as far as its influence\r\nprevails; but, unhappily, in matter of fact, civilization is not\r\nnecessarily Christianity. If we would view things as they really are, we\r\nmust bear in mind that, true as it is, that only a supernatural grace\r\ncan raise man towards the perfection of his nature, yet it is\r\npossible,--without the cultivation of its spiritual part, which\r\ncontemplates objects subtle, distant, delicate of apprehension, and slow\r\nof operation, nay, even with an actual contempt of faith and devotion,\r\nin comparison of objects tangible and present,--possible it is, I say,\r\nto combine in some sort the other faculties of man into one, and to\r\nprogress forward, with the substitution of natural religion for faith,\r\nand a refined expediency or propriety for true morality, just as with\r\npractice a man might manage to run without an arm or without sight, and\r\nas the defect of one organ is sometimes supplied to a certain extent by\r\nthe preternatural action of another.\r\n\r\nAnd this is, in fact, what is commonly understood by civilization, and\r\nit is the sense in which the word must be used here; not that perfection\r\nwhich nature aims at, and requires, and cannot of itself reach; but a\r\nsecond-rate perfection of nature, being what it is, and remaining what\r\nit is, without any supernatural principle, only with its powers of\r\nratiocination, judgment, sagacity, and imagination fully exercised, and\r\nthe affections and passions under sufficient control. Such was it, in\r\nits higher excellences, in heathen Greece and Rome, where the perception\r\nof moral principles, possessed by the cultivated and accomplished\r\nintellect, by the mind of Plato or Isocrates, of Cleanthes, Seneca,\r\nEpictetus, or Antoninus, rivalled in outward pretensions the inspired\r\nteaching of the Apostle of the Gentiles. Such is it at the present day,\r\nnot only in its reception of the elements of religion and morals (when\r\nChristianity is in the midst of it as an inexhaustible storehouse for\r\nnatural reason to borrow from), but especially in a province peculiar to\r\nthese times, viz., in science and art, in physics, in politics, in\r\neconomics, and mechanics. And great as are its attainments at present,\r\nstill, as I have said, we are far from being able to discern, even in\r\nthe distance, the limit of its advancement and of its perfectibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from what has been said, that barbarism is a principle,\r\nnot of society, but of isolation; he who will not submit even to\r\nhimself, is not likely to volunteer a subjection to others; and this is\r\nmore or less the price which, from the nature of the case, the members\r\nof society pay individually for the security of that which they hold in\r\ncommon. It follows, that no polity can be simply barbarous; barbarians\r\nmay indeed combine in small bodies, as they have done in Gaul, Scythia,\r\nand America, from the gregariousness of our nature, from fellowship of\r\nblood, from accidental neighbourhood, or for self-preservation; but such\r\nsocieties are not bodies or polities; they are but the chance result of\r\nan occasion, and are destitute of a common life. Barbarism has no\r\nindividuality, it has no history; quarrels between neighbouring tribes,\r\ngrudges, blood-shedding, exhaustion, raids, success, defeat, the same\r\nthing over and over again, this is not the action of society, nor the\r\nsubject-matter of narrative; it neither interests the curiosity, nor\r\nleaves any impression on the memory. \"_Labitur et labetur_;\" it forms\r\nand breaks again, like the billows of the sea, and is but a mockery of\r\nunity. When I speak of barbarian states, I mean such as consist of\r\nmembers not simply barbarous, but just so far removed from the extreme\r\nof savageness that they admit of having certain principles in common,\r\nand are able to submit themselves individually to the system which rises\r\nout of those principles; that they do recognize the ideas of government,\r\nproperty, and law, however imperfectly; though they still differ from\r\ncivilized polities in those main points, which I have set down as\r\nanalogous to the difference between brutes and the human species.\r\n\r\nAs instinct is perfect after its kind at first, and never advances,\r\nwhereas the range of the intellect is ever growing, so barbarous states\r\nare pretty much the same from first to last, and this is their\r\ncharacteristic; and civilized states, on the other hand, though they\r\nhave had a barbarian era, are ever advancing further and further from\r\nit, and thus their distinguishing badge is progress. So far my line of\r\nthought leads me to concur in the elaborate remarks on the subject put\r\nforth by the celebrated M. Guizot, in his \"Lectures on European\r\nCivilization.\" Civilized states are ever developing into a more perfect\r\norganization, and a more exact and more various operation; they are ever\r\nincreasing their stock of thoughts and of knowledge: ever creating,\r\ncomparing, disposing, and improving. Hence, while bodily strength is the\r\ntoken of barbarian power, mental ability is the honourable badge of\r\ncivilized states. The one is like Ajax, the other like Ulysses;\r\ncivilized nations are constructive, barbarous are destructive.\r\nCivilization spreads by the ways of peace, by moral suasion, by means of\r\nliterature, the arts, commerce, diplomacy, institutions; and, though\r\nmaterial power never can be superseded, it is subordinate to the\r\ninfluence of mind. Barbarians can provide themselves with swift and\r\nhardy horses, can sweep over a country, rush on with a shout, use the\r\nsteel and firebrand, and frighten and overwhelm the weak or cowardly;\r\nbut in the wars of civilized countries, even the implements of carnage\r\nare scientifically constructed, and are calculated to lessen or\r\nsupersede it; and a campaign becomes co-ordinately a tour of _savants_,\r\nor a colonizing expedition, or a political demonstration. When Sesostris\r\nmarched through Asia to the Euxine, he left upon his road monuments of\r\nhimself, which have not utterly disappeared even at this day; and the\r\nmemorials of the rule of the Pharaohs are still engraved on the rocks of\r\nLibya and Arabia. Alexander, again, in a later age, crossed from\r\nMacedonia to Asia with the disciples of Aristotle in his train. His\r\nmarch was the diffusion of the arts and commerce, and the acquisition of\r\nscientific knowledge; the countries he passed through were accurately\r\ndescribed, as he proceeded, and the intervals between halt and halt\r\nregularly measured.[72] His naval armaments explored nearly the whole\r\ndistance from Attock on the Upper Indus to the Isthmus of Suez: his\r\nphilosophers noted down the various productions and beasts of the\r\nunknown East; and his courtiers were the first to report to the western\r\nworld the singular institutions of Hindostan.\r\n\r\nAgain, while Attila boasted that his horse's hoof withered the grass it\r\ntrod on, and Zingis could gallop over the site of the cities he had\r\ndestroyed, Seleucus, or Ptolemy, or Trajan, covered the range of his\r\nconquests with broad capitals, marts of commerce, noble roads, and\r\nspacious harbours. Lucullus collected a magnificent library in the East,\r\nand Cæsar converted his northern expeditions into an antiquarian and\r\nhistorical research.\r\n\r\nNor is this an accident in Roman annals. She was a power pre-eminently\r\nmilitary; yet what is her history but the most remarkable instance of a\r\npolitical development and progress? More than any power, she was able to\r\naccommodate and expand her institutions according to the circumstances\r\nof successive ages, extending her municipal privileges to the conquered\r\ncities, yielding herself to the literature of Greece, and admitting into\r\nher bosom the rites of Egypt and Phrygia. At length, by an effort of\r\nversatility unrivalled in history, she was able to reverse one main\r\narticle of her policy, and, as she had already acknowledged the\r\nintellectual supremacy of Greece, so did she humble herself in a still\r\nmore striking manner before a religion which she had persecuted.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.\r\n\r\nIf these remarks upon the difference between barbarism and civilization\r\nbe in the main correct, they have prepared the way for answering the\r\nquestion which I have raised concerning the principle of life and the\r\nmode of dissolution proper or natural to barbarous and civilized powers\r\nrespectively. Ratiocination and its kindred processes, which are the\r\nnecessary instruments of political progress, are, taking things as we\r\nfind them, hostile to imagination and auxiliary to sense. It is true\r\nthat a St. Thomas can draw out a whole system of theology from\r\nprinciples impalpable and invisible, and fix upon the mind by pure\r\nreason a vast multitude of facts and truths which have no pretence to a\r\nbodily form. But, taking man as he is, we shall commonly find him\r\ndissatisfied with a demonstrative process from an undemonstrated\r\npremiss, and, when he has once begun to reason, he will seek to prove\r\nthe point from which his reasoning starts, as well as that at which it\r\narrives. Thus he will be forced back from immediate first principles to\r\nothers more remote, nor will he be satisfied till he ultimately reaches\r\nthose which are as much within his own handling and mastery as the\r\nreasoning apparatus itself. Hence it is that civilized states ever tend\r\nto substitute objects of sense for objects of imagination, as the basis\r\nof their existence. The Pope's political power was greater when Europe\r\nwas semi-barbarous; and the divine right of the successors of the\r\nEnglish St. Edward received a death-blow in the philosophy of Bacon and\r\nLocke. At present, I suppose, our own political life, as a nation, lies\r\nin the supremacy of the law; and that again is resolvable into the\r\ninternal peace, and protection of life and property, and freedom of the\r\nindividual, which are its result; and these I call objects of sense.\r\n\r\nFor the very same reason, objects of this nature will not constitute the\r\nlife of a barbarian community; prudence, foresight, calculation of\r\nconsequences do not enter into its range of mental operations; it has no\r\ntalent for analysis; it cannot understand expediency; it is impressed\r\nand affected by what is direct and absolute. Religion, superstition,\r\nbelief in persons and families, objects, not proveable, but vivid and\r\nimposing, will be the bond which keeps its members together. I have\r\nalready alluded to the divinity which in the imagination of the Huns\r\nencircled the hideous form of Attila. Zingis claimed for himself or his\r\nancestry a miraculous conception, and received from a prophet, who\r\nascended to heaven, the dominion of the earth. He called himself the son\r\nof God; and when the missionary friars came to his immediate successor\r\nfrom the Pope, that successor made answer to them, that it was the\r\nPope's duty to do him homage, as being earthly lord of all by divine\r\nright. It was a similar pretension, I need hardly say, which was the\r\nlife of the Mahometan conquests, when the wild Saracen first issued from\r\nthe Arabian desert. So, too, in the other hemisphere, the Caziques of\r\naboriginal America were considered to be brothers of the Sun, and\r\nreceived religious homage as his representatives. They spoke as the\r\noracles of the divinity, and claimed the power of regulating the seasons\r\nand the weather at their will. This was especially the case in Peru;\r\n\"the whole system of policy,\" says Robertson, \"was founded on religion.\r\nThe Incas appeared, not only as a legislator, but as the messenger of\r\nheaven.\"[73] Elsewhere, the divine virtue has been considered to rest,\r\nnot on the monarch, but on the code of laws, which accordingly is the\r\nsocial principle of the nation. The Celts ascribed their legislation to\r\nMercury;[74] as Lycurgus and Numa in Sparta and Rome appealed to a\r\ndivine sanction in behalf of their respective institutions.\r\n\r\nThis being the case, imperfect as is the condition of barbarous states,\r\nstill what is there to overthrow them? They have a principle of union\r\ncongenial to the state of their intellect, and they have not the\r\nratiocinative habit to scrutinize and invalidate it. Since they admit of\r\nno mental progress, what serves as a bond to-day will be equally\r\nserviceable to-morrow; so that apparently their dissolution cannot come\r\nfrom themselves. It is true, a barbarous people, possessed of a\r\nbeautiful country, may be relaxed in luxury and effeminacy; but such\r\ndegeneracy has no obvious tendency to weaken their faith in the objects\r\nin which their political unity consists, though it may render them\r\ndefenceless against external attacks. And here indeed lies their real\r\nperil at all times; they are ever vulnerable from without. Thus Sparta,\r\nformed deliberately on a barbarian pattern, remained faithful to it,\r\nwithout change, without decay, while its intellectual rival was the\r\nvictim of successive revolutions. At length its power was broken\r\nexternally by the Theban Epaminondas; and by the restoration of\r\nMessenia, the insurrection of the Laconians, and the emancipation of the\r\nHelots. Agesilaus, at the time of its fall, was as good a Spartan as any\r\nof his predecessors. Again, the ancient Empire of the Huns in Asia is\r\nsaid to have lasted 1,500 years; at length its wanton tyranny was put an\r\nend to by the Chinese King plunging into the Tartar desert, and thus\r\nbreaking their power. Thrace, again, a barbarous country, lasted many\r\ncenturies, with kings of great vigour, with much external prosperity,\r\nand then succumbed, not to internal revolution, but to the permanent\r\nascendancy of Rome. Similar too is the instance of Pontus, and again of\r\nNumidia and Mauritania; they may have had great or accomplished\r\nsovereigns, but they have no history, except in the wars of their\r\nconquerors. Great leaders are necessary for the prosperity, as great\r\nenemies for the destruction, of barbarians; they thrive, as they come to\r\nnought, by means of agents external to themselves. So again Malek Shah\r\ndied, and his empire fell to pieces. Hence, too, the unexpected and\r\nutter catastrophes which befall barbarous people, analogous to a violent\r\ndeath, which I have alluded to in speaking of the sudden rise and fall\r\nof Tartar dynasties; for no one can anticipate results, which, instead\r\nof being the slow evolution of political principles, proceed from the\r\naccident of external quarrels and of the relative condition of rival\r\npowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.\r\n\r\nFar otherwise is the history of those states, in which the intellect,\r\nnot prescription, is recognized as the ultimate authority, and where the\r\ncourse of time is necessarily accompanied by a corresponding course of\r\nchange. Such polities are ever in progress; at first from worse to\r\nbetter, and then from better to worse. In all human things there is a\r\n_maximum_ of advance, and that _maximum_ is not an established state of\r\nthings, but a point in a career. The cultivation of reason and the\r\nspread of knowledge for a time develop and at length dissipate the\r\nelements of political greatness; acting first as the invaluable ally of\r\npublic spirit, and then as its insidious enemy. Barbarian minds remain\r\nin the circle of ideas which sufficed their forefathers; the opinions,\r\nprinciples, and habits which they inherited, they transmit. They have\r\nthe _prestige_ of antiquity and the strength of conservatism; but where\r\nthought is encouraged, too many will think, and will think too much. The\r\nsentiment of sacredness in institutions fades away, and the measure of\r\ntruth or expediency is the private judgment of the individual. An\r\nendless variety of opinion is the certain though slow result; no\r\noverpowering majority of judgments is found to decide what is good and\r\nwhat is bad; political measures become acts of compromise; and at\r\nlength the common bond of unity in the state consists in nothing really\r\ncommon, but simply in the unanimous wish of each member of it to secure\r\nhis own interests. Thus the veterans of Sylla, comfortably settled in\r\ntheir farms, refused to rally round Pompey in his war with Cæsar.[75]\r\nThus the municipal cities in the provinces refused to unite together in\r\na later age for the defence of the Empire, then evidently on the way to\r\ndissolution.[76] Selfishness takes the place of loyalty, patriotism, and\r\nfaith; parties grow and strengthen themselves; classes and ranks\r\nwithdraw from each other more and more; the national energy becomes but\r\na self-consuming fever, and but enables the constituent parts to be\r\ntheir own mutual destruction; and at length such union as is necessary\r\nfor political life is found to be impossible. Meanwhile corruption of\r\nmorals, which is common to all prosperous countries, completes the\r\ninternal ruin, and, whether an external enemy appears or not, the nation\r\ncan hardly be considered any more a state. It is but like some old arch,\r\nwhich, when its supports are crumbled away, stands by the force of\r\ncohesion, no one knows how. It dies a natural death, even though some\r\nAlaric or Genseric happens to be at hand to take possession of the\r\ncorpse. And centuries before the end comes, patriots may see it coming,\r\nthough they cannot tell its hour; and that hour creates surprise, not\r\nbecause it at length is come, but because it has been so long delayed.\r\n\r\nI have been referring to the decline, as I before spoke of the progress,\r\nof the Romans: the career of that people through twelve centuries is a\r\ndrama of sustained interest and equable and majestic evolution; it has\r\ngiven scope for the most ingenious researches into its internal history.\r\nThere one age is the parent of another; the elements and principles of\r\nits political system are brought out into a variety of powers with\r\nmutual relations; external events act and react with domestic affairs;\r\nmanners and views change; excess of prosperity becomes the omen of\r\nmisfortune to come; till in the words of the poet, \"_Suis et ipsa Roma\r\nviribus ruit_.\" For how many philosophical histories has Greece afforded\r\nopportunity! while the constitutional history of England, as far as it\r\nhas hitherto gone, is a recognized subject-matter of scientific and\r\nprofessional teaching. The case is the same with the history of the\r\nmedieval Italian cities, of the medieval Church, and of the Saracenic\r\nempire. As regards the last of these instances, I am not alluding merely\r\nto the civil contentions and wars which took place in it, for such may\r\nequally happen to a barbarian state. Cupidity and ambition are inherent\r\nin the nature of man; the Gauls and British, the tribes of Scythia, the\r\nSeljukian Turks, consisted each of a number of mutually hostile\r\ncommunities or kingdoms. What is relevant to my purpose in the history\r\nof the Saracens is, that their quarrels often had an intellectual basis,\r\nand arose out of their religion. The white, the green, and the black\r\nfactions, who severally reigned at Cordova, Cairo, and Bagdad,\r\nexcommunicated each other, and claimed severally to be the successors of\r\nMahomet. Then came the fanatical innovation of the Carmathians, who\r\npretended to a divine mission to complete the religion of Mahomet, as\r\nMahomet had completed Christianity.[77] They relaxed the duties of\r\nablution, fasting, and pilgrimage; admitted the use of wine, and\r\nprotested against the worldly pomp of the Caliphs. They spread their\r\ntents along the coast of the Persian Gulf, and in no long time were able\r\nto bring an army of 100,000 men into the field. Ultimately they took up\r\ntheir residence on the borders of Assyria, Syria, and Egypt. As time\r\nwent on, and the power of the Caliphs was still further reduced,\r\nreligious contention broke out in Bagdad itself, between the rigid and\r\nthe lax parties, and the followers of the Abbassides and of Ali.\r\n\r\nIf we consult ancient history, the case is the same; the Jews, a people\r\nof progress, were ruined, as appears on the face of Scripture, by\r\ninternal causes; they split into sects, Pharisees, Sadducees, Herodians,\r\nEssenes, as soon as the Divine Hand retired from the direct government\r\nof their polity; and they were fighting together in Jerusalem when the\r\nRomans were beleaguering its walls. Nay, even the disunion, which was a\r\nspecial and divine punishment for their sins, was fulfilled according to\r\nthis natural law which I am illustrating; it was the splendid reign of\r\nSolomon, the era of literature, commerce, opulence, and general\r\nprosperity, which was the antecedent of fatal revolutions. If we turn to\r\ncivilized nations of an even earlier date, the case is the same; we are\r\naccustomed indeed to associate Chinese and Egyptians with ideas of\r\nperpetual untroubled stability; but a philosophical historian, whom I\r\nshall presently cite, speaks far otherwise of those times when the\r\nintellect was prominently active. China was for many centuries the seat\r\nof a number of petty principalities, which were limited, not despotic;\r\nabout 200 years before our era it became one absolute monarchy. Till\r\nthen idolatry was unknown, and the doctrines of Confucius were in\r\nhonour: the first Emperor ordered a general burning of books, burning at\r\nthe same time between 400 and 500 of the followers of Confucius, and\r\npersecuting the men of letters. A rationalist philosophy succeeded, and\r\nthis again gave way to the introduction of the religion of Buddha or Fo,\r\njust about the time of our Lord's Crucifixion. At later periods, in the\r\nfifth and in the thirteenth centuries, the country was divided into two\r\ndistinct kingdoms, north and south; and such was its state when Marco\r\nPolo visited it. It has been several times conquered by the Tartars, and\r\nit is a remarkable proof of its civilization, that it has ever obliged\r\nthem to adopt its manners, laws, and even language. China, then, has a\r\ndistinct and peculiar internal history, and has paid to the full the\r\npenalty which, in the course of centuries, goes along with the blessings\r\nof civilization. \"The whole history of China, from beginning to end,\"\r\nsays Frederic Schlegel, \"displays one continued series of seditions,\r\nusurpations, anarchy, changes of dynasty, and other violent revolutions\r\nand catastrophes.\"[78]\r\n\r\nThe history of Egypt tells the same tale; \"Civil discord,\" he says,\r\n\"existed there under various forms. The country itself was often divided\r\ninto several kingdoms; and, even when united, we observe a great\r\nconflict of interests between the agricultural province of Upper Egypt,\r\nand the commercial and manufacturing province of the Lower: as, indeed,\r\na similar clashing of interests is often to be noticed in modern states.\r\nIn the period immediately preceding the Persian conquest, the caste of\r\nwarriors, or the whole class of nobility, were decidedly opposed to the\r\nmonarchs, because they imagined them to promote too much the power of\r\nthe priesthood;\"--in other words, their national downfall was not owing\r\ndirectly to an external cause, but to an internal collision of parties\r\nand interests;--\"in the same way,\" continues the author I am quoting,\r\n\"as the history of India presents a similar rivalry or political\r\nhostility between the Brahmins and the caste of the Cshatriyas. In the\r\nreign of Psammatichus, the disaffection of the native nobility obliged\r\nthis prince to take Greek soldiers into his pay; and thus at length was\r\nthe defence of Egypt entrusted to an army of foreign mercenaries.\" He\r\nadds, which is apposite to my purpose, for I suppose he is speaking of\r\ncivilized nations, \"In general, states and kingdoms, before they succumb\r\nto a foreign conqueror, are, if not outwardly and visibly, yet secretly\r\nand internally, undermined.\"\r\n\r\nSo much on the connexion between the civilization of a state and its\r\noverthrow from internal causes, or, what may be called, its succumbing\r\nto a natural death. I will only add, that I am but attempting to set\r\ndown general rules, to which there may be exceptions, explicable or not.\r\nFor instance, Venice is one of the most civilized states of the middle\r\nage; but, by a system of jealous and odious tyranny, it continued to\r\nmaintain its ground without revolution, when revolutions were frequent\r\nin the other Italian cities; yet the very necessity of so severe a\r\ndespotism shows us what would have happened there, if natural causes had\r\nbeen left to work unimpeded.\r\n\r\n\r\n7.\r\n\r\nI feel I owe you, Gentlemen, an apology for the time I have consumed in\r\nan abstract discussion; it is drawing to an end, but it still requires\r\nthe notice of two questions, on which, however, I have not much to say,\r\neven if I would. First, can a civilized state become barbarian in course\r\nof years? and secondly, can a barbarian state ever become civilized?\r\n\r\nAs to the former of these questions, considering the human race did\r\nstart with society, and did not start with barbarism, and barbarism\r\nexists, we might be inclined at first sight to answer it in the\r\naffirmative; again, since Christianity implies civilization, and is the\r\nrecovery of the whole race of Adam, we might answer the second in the\r\naffirmative also; but such resolutions of the inquiry are scarcely to\r\nthe point. Doubtless the human race may degenerate, doubtless it may\r\nmake progress; doubtless men, viewed as individuals or as members of\r\nraces or tribes, or as inhabitants of certain countries, may change\r\ntheir state from better to worse, or from worse to better: this,\r\nhowever, is not the question; but whether a given state, which has a\r\ncertain political unity, can change the principle of that unity, and,\r\nwithout breaking up into its component parts, become barbarian instead\r\nof civilized, and civilized instead of barbarian.\r\n\r\n(1.) Now as to the latter of these questions, it still must be answered\r\nin the affirmative under circumstances: that is, all civilized states\r\nhave started with barbarism, and have gradually in the course of ages\r\ndeveloped into civilization, unless there be any political community in\r\nthe world, as China has by some been considered, representative of Noe;\r\nand unless we consider the case of colonies, as Constantinople or\r\nVenice, fairly to form an exception. But the question is very much\r\naltered, when we contemplate a change in one or two generations from\r\nbarbarism to civilization. The substitution of one form of political\r\nlife for another, when it occurs, is the sort of process by which\r\nfossils take the place of animal substances, or strata are formed, or\r\ncarbon is crystallized, or boys grow into men. Christianity itself has\r\nnever, I think, suddenly civilized a race; national habits and opinions\r\ncannot be cast off at will without miracle. Hence the extreme jealousy\r\nand irritation of the members of a state with innovators, who would\r\ntamper with what the Greeks called [Greek: nomima], or constitutional\r\nand vital usages. Hence the fury of Pentheus against the Mænades, and of\r\nthe Scythians against their King Scylas, and the agitation created at\r\nAthens by the destruction of the Mercuries. Hence the obstinacy of the\r\nRoman statesmen of old, and of the British constituency now, against the\r\nCatholic Church; and the feeling is so far justified, that projected\r\ninnovations often turn out, if not simply nugatory, nothing short of\r\ndestructive; and though there is a great notion just now that the\r\nBritish Constitution admits of being fitted upon every people under\r\nheaven, from the Blacks to the Italians, I do not know what has occurred\r\nto give plausibility to the anticipation. England herself once attempted\r\nthe costume of republicanism, but she found that monarchy was part of\r\nher political essence.\r\n\r\n(2.) Still less can the possibility be admitted of a civilized polity\r\nreally relapsing into barbarism; though a state of things may be\r\nsuperinduced, which in many of its features may be thought to resemble\r\nit. In truth, I have not yet traced out the ultimate result of those\r\ninternal revolutions which I have assigned as the incidental but certain\r\nevils, in the long run, attendant on civilization. That result is\r\nvarious: sometimes the over-civilized and degenerate people is swept\r\nfrom the face of the earth, as the Roman populations in Africa by the\r\nVandals; sometimes it is reduced to servitude, as the Egyptians by the\r\nPtolemies, or the Greeks by the Turks; sometimes it is absorbed or\r\nincluded in new political combinations, as the northern Italians by the\r\nLombards and Franks; sometimes it remains unmolested on its own\r\nterritory, and lives by the momentum, or the repute, or the habit, or\r\nthe tradition of its former civilization. This last of course is the\r\nonly case which bears upon the question I am considering; and I grant\r\nthat a state of things does then ensue, which in some of its phenomena\r\nis like barbarism; China is an example in point. No one can deny its\r\ncivilization; its diligent care of the soil, its cultivation of silk and\r\nof the tea-tree, its populousness, its canals, its literature, its court\r\nceremonial, its refinement of manners, its power of persevering so\r\nloyally in its old institutions through so many ages, abundantly\r\nvindicate it from the reproach of barbarism. But at the same time there\r\nare tokens of degeneracy, which are all the stronger for being also\r\ntokens, still more striking than those I have hitherto mentioned, of its\r\nhigh civilization in times past. It has had for ages the knowledge of\r\nthe more recent discoveries and institutions of the West, which have\r\ndone so much for Europe, yet it has been unable to use them, the\r\nmagnetic needle, gunpowder, and printing. The littleness of the national\r\ncharacter, its self-conceit, and its formality, are further instances of\r\nan effete civilization. They remind the observer vividly of the picture\r\nwhich history presents to us of the Byzantine Court before the taking of\r\nConstantinople; or, again, of that _material_ retention of Christian\r\ndoctrine (to use the theological word), of which Protestantism in its\r\nmore orthodox exhibitions, and still more, of which the Greek schism\r\naffords the specimen. Either a state of deadness and mechanical action,\r\nor a restless ebb and flow of opinion and sentiment, is the symptom of\r\nthat intellectual exhaustion and decrepitude, whether in politics or\r\nreligion, which, if old age be a second childhood, may in some sense be\r\ncalled barbarism, and of which, at present, we are respectively reminded\r\nin China on the one hand, and in some southern states of Europe on the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThese are the principles, whatever modifications they may require,\r\nwhich, however rudely adumbrated, I trust will suffice to enable me to\r\ncontemplate the future of the Ottoman Empire.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[72] Murray's Asia.\r\n\r\n[73] Robertson's America, books vi. and vii.\r\n\r\n[74] Univ.

The barbarian lives without\r\nprinciple and without aim; he does but reflect the successive outward\r\ncircumstances in which he finds himself, and he varies with them. He\r\nchanges suddenly, when their change is sudden, and is as unlike what he\r\nwas just before, as one fortune or external condition is unlike another.\r\nHe moves when he is urged by appetite; else, he remains in sloth and\r\ninactivity. He lives, and he dies, and he has done nothing, but leaves\r\nthe world as he found it. And what the individual is, such is his whole\r\ngeneration; and as that generation, such is the generation before and\r\nafter. No generation can say what it has been doing; it has not made the\r\nstate of things better or worse; for retrogression there is hardly room;\r\nfor progress, no sort of material. Now I shall show that these\r\ncharacteristics of the barbarian are rudimental points, as I may call\r\nthem, in the picture of the Turks, as drawn by those who have studied\r\nthem. I shall principally avail myself of the information supplied by\r\nMr. Thornton and M. Volney, men of name and ability, and for various\r\nreasons preferable as authorities to writers of the present day.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\n\"The Turks,\" says Mr. Thornton, who, though not blind to their\r\nshortcomings, is certainly favourable to them, \"the Turks are of a grave\r\nand saturnine cast ... patient of hunger and privations, capable of\r\nenduring the hardships of war, but not much inclined to habits of\r\nindustry.... They prefer apathy and indolence to active enjoyments; but\r\nwhen moved by a powerful stimulus they sometimes indulge in pleasures in\r\nexcess.\" \"The Turk,\" he says elsewhere, \"stretched at his ease on the\r\nbanks of the Bosphorus, glides down the stream of existence without\r\nreflection on the past, and without anxiety for the future. His life is\r\none continued and unvaried reverie. To his imagination the whole\r\nuniverse appears occupied in procuring him pleasures.... Every custom\r\ninvites to repose, and every object inspires an indolent voluptuousness.\r\nTheir delight is to recline on soft verdure under the shade of trees,\r\nand to muse without fixing the attention, lulled by the trickling of a\r\nfountain or the murmuring of a rivulet, and inhaling through their pipe\r\na gently inebriating vapour. Such pleasures, the highest which the rich\r\ncan enjoy, are equally within the reach of the artizan or the peasant.\"\r\n\r\nM. Volney corroborates this account of them:--\"Their behaviour,\" he\r\nsays, \"is serious, austere, and melancholy; they rarely laugh, and the\r\ngaiety of the French appears to them a fit of delirium. When they speak,\r\nit is with deliberation, without gestures and without passion; they\r\nlisten without interrupting you; they are silent for whole days\r\ntogether, and they by no means pique themselves on supporting\r\nconversation. If they walk, it is always leisurely, and on business.\r\nThey have no idea of our troublesome activity, and our walks backwards\r\nand forwards for amusement. Continually seated, they pass whole days\r\nsmoking, with their legs crossed, their pipes in their mouths, and\r\nalmost without changing their attitude.\" Englishmen present as great a\r\ncontrast to the Ottoman as the French; as a late English traveller\r\nbrings before us, apropos of seeing some Turks in quarantine:\r\n\"Certainly,\" he says, \"Englishmen are the least able to wait, and the\r\nTurks the most so, of any people I have ever seen. To impede an\r\nEnglishman's locomotion on a journey, is equivalent to stopping the\r\ncirculation of his blood; to disturb the repose of a Turk on his, is to\r\nre-awaken him to a painful sense of the miseries of life. The one nation\r\nat rest is as much tormented as Prometheus, chained to his rock, with\r\nthe vulture feeding on him; the other in motion is as uncomfortable as\r\nIxion tied to his ever-moving wheel.\"[79]\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\nHowever, the barbarian, when roused to action, is a very different being\r\nfrom the barbarian at rest. \"The Turk,\" says Mr. Thornton, \"is usually\r\nplacid, hypochondriac, and unimpassioned; but, when the customary\r\nsedateness of his temper is ruffled, his passions ... are furious and\r\nuncontrollable. The individual seems possessed with all the ungovernable\r\nfury of a multitude; and all ties, all attachments, all natural and\r\nmoral obligations, are forgotten or despised, till his rage subsides.\" A\r\nsimilar remark is made by a writer of the day: \"The Turk on horseback\r\nhas no resemblance to the Turk reclining on his carpet. He there assumes\r\na vigour, and displays a dexterity, which few Europeans would be\r\ncapable of emulating; no horsemen surpass the Turks; and, with all the\r\nindolence of which they are accused, no people are more fond of the\r\nviolent exercise of riding.\"[80]\r\n\r\nSo was it with their ancestors, the Tartars; now dosing on their horses\r\nor their waggons, now galloping over the plains from morning to night.\r\nHowever, these successive phases of Turkish character, as reported by\r\ntravellers, have seemed to readers as inconsistencies in their reports;\r\nThornton accepts the inconsistency. \"The national character of the\r\nTurks,\" he says, \"is a composition of contradictory qualities. We find\r\nthem brave and pusillanimous; gentle and ferocious; resolute and\r\ninconstant; active and indolent; fastidiously abstemious, and\r\nindiscriminately indulgent. The great are alternately haughty and\r\nhumble, arrogant and cringing, liberal and sordid.\" What is this but to\r\nsay in one word that we find them barbarians?\r\n\r\nAccording to these distinct moods or phases of character, they will\r\nleave very various impressions of themselves on the minds of successive\r\nbeholders. A traveller finds them in their ordinary state in repose and\r\nserenity; he is surprised and startled to find them so different from\r\nwhat he imagined; he admires and extols them, and inveighs against the\r\nprejudice which has slandered them to the European world. He finds them\r\nmild and patient, tender to the brute creation, as becomes the children\r\nof a Tartar shepherd, kind and hospitable, self-possessed and dignified,\r\nthe lowest classes sociable with each other, and the children gamesome.\r\nIt is true; they are as noble as the lion of the desert, and as gentle\r\nand as playful as the fireside cat. Our traveller observes all\r\nthis;[81] and seems to forget that from the humblest to the highest of\r\nthe feline tribe, from the cat to the lion, the most wanton and\r\ntyrannical cruelty alternates with qualities more engaging or more\r\nelevated. Other barbarous tribes also have their innocent aspects--from\r\nthe Scythians in the classical poets and historians down to the Lewchoo\r\nislanders in the pages of Basil Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\n2. But whatever be the natural excellences of the Turks, progressive\r\nthey are not. This Sir Charles Fellows seems to allow: \"My intimacy with\r\nthe character of the Turks,\" he says, \"which has led me to think so\r\nhighly of their moral excellence, has not given me the same favourable\r\nimpression of the development of their mental powers. Their refinement\r\nis of manners and affections; there is little cultivation or activity of\r\nmind among them.\" This admission implies a great deal, and brings us to\r\na fresh consideration. Observe, they were in the eighth century of their\r\npolitical existence when Thornton and Volney lived among them, and these\r\nauthors report of them as follows:--\"Their buildings,\" says Thornton,\r\n\"are heavy in their proportions, bad in detail, both in taste and\r\nexecution, fantastic in decoration, and destitute of genius. Their\r\ncities are not decorated with public monuments, whose object is to\r\nenliven or to embellish.\" Their religion forbids them every sort of\r\npainting, sculpture, or engraving; thus the fine arts cannot exist among\r\nthem. They have no music but vocal; and know of no accompaniment except\r\na bass of one note like that of the bagpipe. Their singing is in a great\r\nmeasure recitative, with little variation of note. They have scarcely\r\nany notion of medicine or surgery; and they do not allow of anatomy. As\r\nto science, the telescope, the microscope, the electric battery, are\r\nunknown, except as playthings. The compass is not universally employed\r\nin their navy, nor are its common purposes thoroughly understood.\r\nNavigation, astronomy, geography, chemistry, are either not known, or\r\npractised only on antiquated and exploded principles. As to their civil\r\nand criminal codes of law, these are unalterably fixed in the Koran.\r\nTheir habits require very little furniture; \"the whole inventory of a\r\nwealthy family,\" says Volney, \"consists in a carpet, mats, cushions,\r\nmattresses, some small cotton clothes, copper and wooden platters for\r\nthe table, a mortar, a portable mill, a little porcelain, and some\r\nplates of copper tinned. All our apparatus of tapestry, wooden\r\nbedsteads, chairs, stools, glasses, desks, bureaus, closets, buffets\r\nwith their plate and table services, all our cabinet and upholstery-work\r\nare unknown.\" They have no clocks, though they have watches. In short,\r\nthey are hardly more than dismounted Tartars still; and, if pressed by\r\nthe Powers of Christendom, would be able, at very short warning, to pack\r\nup and turn their faces northward to their paternal deserts. You find in\r\ntheir cities barbers and mercers; saddlers and gunsmiths; bakers and\r\nconfectioners; sometimes butchers; whitesmiths and ironmongers; these\r\nare pretty nearly all their trades. Their inheritance is their all;\r\ntheir own acquisition is nought. Their stuffs are from the classical\r\nGreeks; their dyes are the old Tyrian; their cement is of the age of the\r\nRomans; and their locks may be traced back to Solomon. They do not\r\ncommonly engage either in agriculture or in commerce; of the cultivators\r\nof the soil I have said quite enough in a foregoing Lecture, and their\r\ncommerce seems to be generally in the hands of Franks, Greeks, or\r\nArmenians, as formerly in the hands of the Jews.[82]\r\n\r\nThe White Huns took to commerce and diplomacy in the course of a century\r\nor two; the Saracens in a shorter time unlearned their barbarism, and\r\nbecame philosophers and experimentalists; what have the Turks to show to\r\nthe human race for their long spell of prosperity and power?\r\n\r\nAs to their warfare, their impracticable and unprogressive temperament\r\nshowed itself even in the era of their military and political\r\nascendancy, and had much to do, as far as human causes are concerned,\r\nwith their defeat at Lepanto. \"The signal for engaging was no sooner\r\ngiven,\" says the writer in the \"Universal History,\" \"than the Turks with\r\na hideous cry fell on six galeasses, which lay at anchor near a mile\r\nahead of the confederate fleet.\" \"With a hideous cry,\"--this was the\r\ntrue barbarian onset; we find it in the Red Indians and the New\r\nZealanders; and it is noticed of the Seljukians, the predecessors of the\r\nOttomans, in their celebrated engagement with the Crusaders at Dorylæum.\r\n\"With horrible howlings,\" says Mr. Turner, \"and loud clangour of drums\r\nand trumpets, the Turks rushed on;\" and you may recollect, the savage\r\nwho would have murdered the Bishop of Bamberg, began with a shriek.\r\nHowever, as you will see directly, such an onset was as ignorant as it\r\nwas savage, for it was made with a haughty and wilful blindness to the\r\nimportance of firearms under their circumstances. The Turks, in the\r\nhey-day of their victories and under their most sagacious leaders, had\r\nscorned and ignored the use of the then newly invented instruments of\r\nwar. In truth, they had shared the prejudice against firearms which had\r\nbeen in the first instance felt by the semi-barbarous chivalry of\r\nEurope. The knight-errant, as Ariosto draws and reflects him, disdained\r\nso dishonourable a means of beating a foe. He looked upon the use of\r\ngunpowder, as Mr. Thornton reminds us, as \"cruel, cowardly, and\r\nmurderous;\" because it gave an unfair and disgraceful advantage to the\r\nfeeble or the unwarlike. Such was the sentiment of the Ottomans even in\r\nthe reign of their great Soliman. Shortly before the battle of Lepanto,\r\na Dalmatian horseman rode express to Constantinople, and reported to the\r\nDivan, that 2,500 Turks had been surprised and routed by 500\r\nmusqueteers. Great was the indignation of the assembly against the\r\nunfortunate troops, of whom the messenger was one. But he was successful\r\nin his defence of himself and his companions. \"Do you not hear,\" he\r\nsaid, \"that we were overcome by guns? We were routed by fire, not by the\r\nenemy. It would have been otherwise, had it been a contest of courage.\r\nThey took fire to their aid; fire is one of the elements; what is man\r\nthat he should resist their shock?\" They did not dream of the apophthegm\r\nthat knowledge is power; and that we become strong by subduing nature to\r\nour will.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, their tactics by sea was a sort of land engagement on deck,\r\nas it was with our ancestors, and with the ancients. First, they charged\r\nthe adverse vessel, with a view of taking it; if that would not do, they\r\nboarded it. They fought hand to hand, and each captain might pretty much\r\nexercise his own judgment which ship to attack, as Homer's heroes chose\r\ntheir combatants on the field of Troy. However, the Christian galeasses\r\nat Lepanto,--for to these we must at length return,--were vessels of\r\nlarger dimensions than the Ottomans had ever built; they were fortified,\r\nlike castles, with heavy ordnance, and were so disposed as to cover the\r\nline of their own galleys. The consequence was, that as the Turks\r\nadvanced in order of battle, these galeasses kept up a heavy and\r\ndestructive fire upon them, and their barbarian energy availed them as\r\nlittle as their howlings. It was the triumph of civilization over brute\r\nforce, as well as of faith over misbelief. \"While discipline and\r\nattention to the military exercises could insure success in war, the\r\nTurks,\" says Thornton, \"were the first of military nations. When the\r\nwhole art of war was changed, and victory or defeat became matter of\r\ncalculation, the rude and illiterate Turkish warriors experienced the\r\nfatal consequences of ignorance without suspecting the cause; accustomed\r\nto employ no other means than force, they sunk into despondency, when\r\nforce could no longer avail.\"\r\n\r\nAnother half century has passed since this was written, and the Turkish\r\npower has now completed its eighth century since Togrul Beg, the first\r\nSeljukian Sultan; and what has been the fruit of so long a duration?\r\nJust about the time of Togrul Beg, flourished William, Duke of Normandy;\r\nhe passed over to take possession of England; compare the England of the\r\nConquest with the England of this day. Again, compare the Rome of Junius\r\nBrutus to the Rome of Constantine, 800 years afterwards. In each of\r\nthese polities there was a continuous progression, and the end was\r\nunlike the beginning; but the Turks, except that they have gained the\r\nfaculty of political union, are pretty much what they were when they\r\ncrossed the Jaxartes and Oxus. Again, at the time of Togrul Beg, the\r\nGreek schism also took place; now from Michael Cerularius, in 1054, to\r\nAnthimus, in 1853, Patriarchs of Constantinople, eight centuries have\r\npassed of religious deadness and insensibility: a longer time has passed\r\nin China of a similar political inertness: yet China has preserved at\r\nleast the civilization, and Greece the ecclesiastical science, with\r\nwhich they respectively passed into their long sleep; but the Turks of\r\nthis day are still in the less than infancy of art, literature,\r\nphilosophy, and general knowledge; and we may fairly conclude that, if\r\nthey have not learned the very alphabet of science in eight hundred\r\nyears, they are not likely to set to work on it in the nine hundredth.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is remarkable that with them, as with the ancient Medes and\r\nPersians, change of law and government is distinctly prohibited. The\r\ngreatest of their Sultans, and the last of the great ten, Soliman, known\r\nin European history as the Magnificent, is called by his compatriots the\r\nRegulator, on account of the irreversible sanction which he gave to the\r\nexisting administration of affairs. \"The magnitude and the splendour of\r\nthe military achievements of Soliman,\" says Mr. Thornton, \"are surpassed\r\nin the judgment of his people by the wisdom of his legislation. He has\r\nacquired the name of Canuni, or institutor of rules ... on account of\r\nthe order and police which he established in his Empire. He caused a\r\ncompilation to be made of all the maxims and regulations of his\r\npredecessors on subjects of political and military economy. He strictly\r\ndefined the duties, the powers, and the privileges of all governors,\r\ncommanders, and public functionaries, He regulated the levies, the\r\nservices, the equipments, and the pay of the military and maritime force\r\nof the Empire. He prescribed the mode of collecting, and of applying,\r\nthe public revenue. He assigned to every officer his rank at court, in\r\nthe city, and in the army; and the observance of his regulations was\r\nenforced on his successors by the sanction of his authority. The work,\r\nwhich his ancestors had begun, and which his care had completed, seemed\r\nto himself and his contemporaries the compendium of human wisdom.\r\nSoliman contemplated it with the fondness of a parent; and, conceiving\r\nit not to be susceptible of further improvement, he endeavoured to\r\nsecure its perpetual duration.\" The author, after pointing out that this\r\nwas done at the very time when a new hemisphere was in course of\r\nexploration, when the telescope was mapping for mankind the heavens,\r\nwhen the Baconian philosophy was about to convert discovery and\r\nexperiment into instruments of science, printing was carrying knowledge\r\nand literature into the heart of society, and the fine arts were\r\nreceiving one of their most remarkable developments, proceeds: \"The\r\ninstitutions of Soliman placed a barrier between his subjects and future\r\nimprovement. He beheld with complacency and exultation the eternal\r\nfabric which his hands had reared; and the curse denounced against pride\r\nhas reduced the nation, which participated in his sentiments, to a state\r\nof inferiority to the present level of civilized men.\" The result is the\r\nsame, though we say that Soliman only recognized and affirmed that\r\nbarbarism was the law of the Ottoman power.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\n3. It is true that in the last quarter of a century efforts have been\r\nmade by the government of Constantinople to innovate on the existing\r\ncondition of its people; and it has addressed itself in the first\r\ninstance to certain details of daily Turkish life. We must take it for\r\ngranted that it began with such changes as were easiest; if so, its\r\nfailure in these small matters suggests how little ground there is for\r\nhope of success in other advances more important and difficult. Every\r\none knows that in the details of dress, carriage, and general manners,\r\nthe Turks are very different from Europeans: so different, and so\r\nconsistently different, that the contrariety would seem to arise from\r\nsome difference of essential principle. \"This dissimilitude,\" says Mr.\r\nThornton, \"which pervades the whole of their habits, is so general, even\r\nin things of apparent insignificance, as almost to indicate design\r\nrather than accident. The whole exterior of the Oriental is different\r\nfrom ours.\" And then he goes on to mention some specimens, to which we\r\nare able to add others from Volney and Bell. For instance:--The European\r\nstands firm and erect; his head drawn back, his chest advanced, his toes\r\nturned out, his knees straight. The attitude of the Turk, in each of\r\nthese particulars, is different, and, to express myself by an\r\nantithesis, is more conformable to nature, and less to reason. The\r\nEuropean wears short and close garments, the Turk long and ample. The\r\none uncovers the head, when he would show reverence; with the other, a\r\nbared head is a sign of folly. The one salutes by an inclination, the\r\nother by raising himself. The one passes his life upright, the other\r\nsitting. The one sits on raised seats, the other on the ground. In\r\ninviting a person to approach, the one draws his hand to him, the other\r\nthrusts it from him. The host in Europe helps himself last; in Turkey,\r\nfirst. The one drinks to his company, or at least to some toast; the\r\nother drinks silently, and his guests congratulate him. The European has\r\na night dress, the Turk lies down in his clothes. The Turkish barber\r\npushes the razor from him; the Turkish carpenter draws the saw to him;\r\nthe Turkish mason sits as he builds; and he begins a house at the top,\r\nand finishes at the bottom, so that the upper rooms are inhabited, when\r\nthe bottom is a framework.\r\n\r\nNow it would seem as if this multitude of little usages hung together,\r\nand were as difficult to break through as the meshes of some complicated\r\nweb. However, the Sultan found it the most favourable subject-matter of\r\nhis incipient reformation; and his consequent attempt and the omens of\r\nits ultimate issue are interestingly recounted in the pages of Sir\r\nCharles Fellows, the panegyrist both of Mahmood and his people. \"The\r\nTurk,\" he says, \"proud of his beard, comes up from the province a\r\ncandidate for, or to receive, the office of governor. The Sultan gives\r\nhim an audience, passes his hand over his own short-trimmed beard; the\r\ncandidate takes the hint, and appears the next day shorn of his honoured\r\nlocks. The Sultan, who is always attired in a plain blue frock coat,\r\nasks of the aspirant for office if he admires it; he, of course, praises\r\nthe costume worn by his patron; whereupon the Sultan suggests that he\r\nwould look well in it, as also in the red unturbaned fez. The following\r\nday the officer again attends to receive or lose his appointment; and,\r\nto promote the progress of his suit, throws off his costly and beautiful\r\ncostume, and appears like the Sultan in the dull unsightly frock.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the triumph of loyalty and self-interest, and such is its limit.\r\n\"A regimental cloak,\" continues our author, \"may sometimes be seen\r\ncovering a fat body inclosed in all the robes of the Turkish costume;\r\nthe whole bundle, including the fur-lined gown, being strapped together\r\nround the waist. Some of the figures are literally as broad as long, and\r\nhave a laughable effect on horseback. The saddles for the upper classes\r\nare now generally made of the European form; but the people, who cannot\r\ngive up their accustomed love of finery for plain leather, have them\r\nmostly of purple or crimson velvet, embroidered with silver or gold, the\r\nholsters ornamented with beautiful patterns.\" After a while, he\r\ncontinues: \"One very unpopular reform which the Sultan tried to effect\r\nin the formation of his troops was that of their wearing braces, a\r\nnecessary accompaniment to the trousers; and why? because these form a\r\ncross, the badge of the infidel, upon the back. Many, indeed, will\r\nsubmit to severe punishment, and even death, for disobedience to\r\nmilitary orders, rather than bear upon their persons this sign hostile\r\nto their religion.\"\r\n\r\nIn another place he continues this subject with an amusing accuracy of\r\nanalysis:--\"The mere substitution of trousers for their loose dress\r\ninterferes seriously with their old habits; they all turn in their toes,\r\nin consequence of the Turkish manner of sitting, and they walk wide, and\r\nwith a swing, from being habituated to the full drapery: this gait has\r\nbecome natural to them, and in their European trousers they walk in the\r\nsame manner. They wear wide-topped loose boots, which push up their\r\ntrousers. Wellington boots would be still more inconvenient, as they\r\nmust slip them off six times a day for prayers. In this new dress they\r\ncannot with comfort sit or kneel on the ground, as is their custom; and\r\nthey will thus be led to use chairs; and with chairs they will want\r\ntables. But, were these to be introduced, their houses would be too low,\r\nfor their heads would almost touch the ceiling. Thus by a little\r\ninnovation might their whole usages be unhinged.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n5.\r\n\r\n4. In these failures, however, should they turn out to be such, the _vis\r\ninertiæ_ of habit is not the whole account of the matter; an\r\nantagonistic principle is at work, characteristic of the barbarian, and\r\nintimately present to the mind of a Turk--national pride. All nations,\r\nindeed, are proud of themselves; but, as being the first and the best,\r\nnot as being the solitary existing perfection, among the inhabitants of\r\nthe earth. Civilized nations allow that foreigners have their specific\r\nexcellences, and such excellences as are a lesson to themselves. They\r\nmay think too well of their own proficiency, and may lose by such\r\nblindness; but they admit enough about others to allow of their own\r\nemulation and advance; whereas the barbarian, in his own estimate, is\r\nperfect already; and what is perfect cannot be improved. Hence he\r\ncherishes in his heart a self-esteem of a very peculiar kind, and a\r\nspecial contempt of others. He views foreigners, either as simply\r\nunworthy of his attention, or as objects of his legitimate dominion.\r\nThus, too, he justifies his sloth, and places his ignorance of all\r\nthings human and divine on a sort of intellectual basis.\r\n\r\nRobertson, in his history of America, enlarges on this peculiarity of\r\nthe savage. \"The Tartar,\" he says, \"accustomed to roam over extensive\r\nplains, and to subsist on the produce of his herds, imprecates upon his\r\nenemy, as the greatest of all curses, that he may be condemned to reside\r\nin one place, and to be nourished with the top of a weed. The rude\r\nAmericans ... far from complaining of their own situation, or viewing\r\nthat of men in a more improved state with admiration or envy, regard\r\nthemselves as the standard of excellence, as beings the best entitled,\r\nas well as the most perfectly qualified, to enjoy real happiness....\r\nVoid of foresight, as well as free from care themselves, and delighted\r\nwith that state of indolent security, they wonder at the anxious\r\nprecautions, the unceasing industry, and complicated arrangements of\r\nEuropeans, in guarding against distant evils, or providing for future\r\nwants; and they often exclaim against their preposterous folly, in thus\r\nmultiplying the troubles, and increasing the labour of life.... The\r\nappellation which the Iroquois give to themselves is, 'The chief of\r\nmen.' Caraibe, the original name of the fierce inhabitants of the\r\nWindward Islands, signifies 'The warlike people.' The Cherokees, from an\r\nidea of their own superiority, call the Europeans 'Nothings,' or 'The\r\naccursed race,' and assume to themselves the name of 'The beloved\r\npeople....' They called them the froth of the sea, men without father or\r\nmother. They suppose that either they have no country of their own, and,\r\ntherefore, invaded that which belonged to others; or that, being\r\ndestitute of the necessaries of life at home, they were obliged to roam\r\nover the ocean, in order to rob such as were more amply provided.\"[83]\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see that an intense self-adoration, such as is here\r\nsuggested, is, in the case of a martial people, to a certain point a\r\nprinciple of strength; it gives a sort of intellectual force to the\r\nimpetuosity and obstinacy of their attacks; while, on the other hand, it\r\nis in the long run a principle of debility, as blinding them to the most\r\nevident and imminent dangers, and, after defeat, burdening and\r\nprecipitating their despair.\r\n\r\nNow, is it possible to trace this attribute of barbarism among the\r\nTurks? If so, what does it do for them, and whence is it supplied? You\r\nwill recollect, I have not been unwilling in a former Lecture to\r\nacknowledge what is salutary in Mahometanism; certainly it embodies in\r\nit some ancient and momentous truths, and is undeniably beneficial so\r\nfar as their proper influence extends. But, after all, looked at as a\r\nreligion, it is as debasing to the populations which receive it as it\r\nis false; and, as it arose among barbarians, it is not wonderful that it\r\nsubserves the reign of barbarism. This it certainly does in the case of\r\nthe Turks; already three great departments of intellectual activity in\r\ncivilized countries have incidentally come before us, which are\r\nforbidden ground to its professors. The first is legislation; for the\r\ncriminal and civil code of the Mahometan is unalterably fixed in the\r\nKoran. The second is the modern system of money transactions and\r\nfinance; for \"in obedience to their religion,\" says an author I have\r\nbeen lately quoting,[84] \"which, like the Jewish law, forbids taking\r\ninterest for money, the Turks abstain from carrying on many lucrative\r\ntrades connected with the lending of money. Hence other nations,\r\ngenerally the Armenians, act as their bankers.\" The third is the\r\ndepartment of the Fine Arts for, it being unlawful to represent the\r\nhuman form, nay, any natural substance whatever, as fruit or flowers,\r\nsculpture loses its solitary object, painting is almost extinguished,\r\nwhile architecture has been obliged to undergo a sort of revolution in\r\nits decorative portions to accommodate it to the restriction. These,\r\nhowever, are matters of detail, though of very high importance; what I\r\nwish rather to point out is the general tendency of Mahometanism, as\r\nsuch, to foster those very faults in the barbarian which keep him from\r\nameliorating his condition. Here something might be said on what seems\r\nto be the acknowledged effect of its doctrine of fatalism, viz., in\r\nencouraging a barbarian recklessness of mind both in special seasons of\r\nprosperity and adversity, and in the ordinary business of life; but this\r\nis a point which it is difficult to speak of without a more intimate\r\nknowledge of its circumstances than can be gained at a distance; I\r\nprefer to show how the Religion is calculated to act upon that\r\nextravagant self-conceit, which Robertson tells us is so congenial to\r\nuncivilized man. While, on the one hand, it closes the possible openings\r\nand occasions of internal energy and self-education, it has no tendency\r\nto compensate for this mischief, on the other, by inculcating any docile\r\nattention to the instruction of foreigners.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.\r\n\r\nTo learn from others, you must entertain a respect for them; no one\r\nlistens to those whom he contemns. Christian nations make progress in\r\nsecular matters, because they are aware they have many things to learn,\r\nand do not mind from whom they learn them, so that he be able to teach.\r\nIt is true that Christianity, as well as Mahometanism, which imitated\r\nit, has its visible polity, and its universal rule, and its especial\r\nprerogatives and powers and lessons, for its disciples. But, with a\r\ndivine wisdom, and contrary to its human copyist, it has carefully\r\nguarded (if I may use the expression) against extending its revelations\r\nto any point which would blunt the keenness of human research or the\r\nactivity of human toil. It has taken those matters for its field in\r\nwhich the human mind, left to itself, could not profitably exercise\r\nitself, or progress, if it would; it has confined its revelations to the\r\nprovince of theology, only indirectly touching on other departments of\r\nknowledge, so far as theological truth accidentally affects them; and it\r\nhas shown an equally remarkable care in preventing the introduction of\r\nthe spirit of caste or race into its constitution or administration.\r\nPure nationalism it abhors; its authoritative documents pointedly ignore\r\nthe distinction of Jew and Gentile, and warn us that the first often\r\nbecomes the last; while its subsequent history has illustrated this\r\ngreat principle, by its awful, and absolute, and inscrutable, and\r\nirreversible passage from country to country, as its territory and its\r\nhome. Such, then, it has been in the divine counsels, and such, too, as\r\nrealized in fact; but man has ways of his own, and, even before its\r\nintroduction into the world, the inspired announcements, which preceded\r\nit, were distorted by the people to whom they were given, to minister to\r\nviews of a very different kind. The secularized Jews, relying on the\r\nsupernatural favours locally and temporally bestowed on themselves, fell\r\ninto the error of supposing that a conquest of the earth was reserved\r\nfor some mighty warrior of their own race, and that, in compensation of\r\nthe reverses which befell them, they were to become an imperial nation.\r\n\r\nWhat a contrast is presented to us by these different ideas of a\r\nuniversal empire! The distinctions of race are indelible; a Jew cannot\r\nbecome a Greek, or a Greek a Jew; birth is an event of past time;\r\naccording to the Judaizers, their nation, as a nation, was ever to be\r\ndominant; and all other nations, as such, were inferior and subject.\r\nWhat was the necessary consequence? There is nothing men more pride\r\nthemselves on than birth, for this very reason, that it is irrevocable;\r\nit can neither be given to those who have it not, nor taken away from\r\nthose who have. The Almighty can do anything which admits of doing; He\r\ncan compensate every evil; but a Greek poet says that there is one thing\r\nimpossible to Him--to undo what is done. Without throwing the thought\r\ninto a shape which borders on the profane, we may see in it the reason\r\nwhy the idea of national power was so dear and so dangerous to the Jew.\r\nIt was his consciousness of inalienable superiority that led him to\r\nregard Roman and Greek, Syrian and Egyptian, with ineffable arrogance\r\nand scorn. Christians, too, are accustomed to think of those who are not\r\nChristians as their inferiors; but the conviction which possesses them,\r\nthat they have what others have not, is obviously not open to the\r\ntemptation which nationalism presents. According to their own faith,\r\nthere is no insuperable gulf between themselves and the rest of mankind;\r\nthere is not a being in the whole world but is invited by their religion\r\nto occupy the same position as themselves, and, did he come, would stand\r\non their very level, as if he had ever been there. Such accessions to\r\ntheir body they continually receive, and they are bound under obligation\r\nof duty to promote them. They never can pronounce of any one, now\r\nexternal to them, that he will not some day be among them; they never\r\ncan pronounce of themselves that, though they are now within, they may\r\nnot some day be found outside, the divine polity. Such are the\r\nsentiments inculcated by Christianity, even in the contemplation of the\r\nvery superiority which it imparts; even there it is a principle, not of\r\nrepulsion between man and man, but of good fellowship; but as to\r\nsubjects of secular knowledge, since here it does not arrogate any\r\nsuperiority at all, it has in fact no tendency whatever to centre its\r\ndisciple's contemplation on himself, or to alienate him from his kind.\r\nHe readily acknowledges and defers to the superiority in art or science\r\nof those, if so be, who are unhappily enemies to Christianity. He admits\r\nthe principle of progress on all matters of knowledge and conduct on\r\nwhich the Creator has not decided the truth already by revealing it; and\r\nhe is at all times ready to learn, in those merely secular matters, from\r\nthose who can teach him best. Thus it is that Christianity, even\r\nnegatively, and without contemplating its positive influences, is the\r\nreligion of civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\n7.\r\n\r\nBut I have here been directing your attention to Christianity with no\r\nother view than to illustrate, by the contrast, the condition of the\r\nMahometan Turks. Their religion is not far from embodying the very dream\r\nof the Judaizing zealots of the Apostolic age. On the one hand, there is\r\nin it the profession of a universal empire, and an empire by conquest;\r\nnay, military success seems to be considered the special note of its\r\ndivine origin. On the other hand, I believe it is a received notion with\r\nthem that their religion is not even intended for the north of the\r\nearth, for some reasons connected with its ceremonial; nor is there in\r\nit any public recognition, as in intercessory prayer, of the duty of\r\nconverting infidels. Certainly, the idea of Mahometan missions and\r\nmissionaries, unless an army in the field may be considered to be such,\r\nis never suggested to us by Eastern historian or traveller, as entering\r\ninto their religious system. Though the Caliphate, then, may be\r\ntransferred from Saracen to Turk, Mahometanism is essentially a\r\nconsecration of the principle of nationalism; and thereby is as\r\ncongenial to the barbarian as Christianity is congenial to man\r\ncivilized. The less a man knows, the more conceited he is of his\r\nproficiency; and, the more barbarous is a nation, the more imposing and\r\nperemptory are its claims. Such was the spirit of the religion of the\r\nTartars, whatever was the nature of its tenets in detail. It deified the\r\nTartar race; Zingis Khan was \"the son of God, mild and venerable;\" and\r\n\"God was great and exalted over all, and immortal, but Zingis Khan was\r\nsole lord upon the earth.\"[85] Such, too, is the strength of the Greek\r\nschism, which there only flourishes where it can fasten on barbarism,\r\nand extol the prerogatives of an elect nation. The Czar is the\r\ndivinely-appointed source of religious power; his country is \"Holy\r\nRussia;\" and the high office committed to him and to it is to extend\r\nwhat it considers the orthodox faith. The Osmanlis are not behind Tartar\r\nor Russ in pretending to a divine mission; the Sultan, in his treaties\r\nwith Christian Powers, calls himself \"Refuge of Sovereigns, Distributor\r\nof Crowns to the Kings of the earth, Master of Europe, Asia, and Africa,\r\nand shadow of God upon earth.\"\r\n\r\nWe might smile at such titles, were they not claimed in good earnest,\r\nand professed in order to be used. It is said to be the popular belief\r\namong the Turks, that the monarchs of Europe are, as this imperial style\r\ndeclares, the feudatories of the Sultan. We should smile, too, at the\r\nvery opposite titles which they apply to Europeans, did they not here,\r\ntoo, mean what they say, and strengthen and propagate their own scorn\r\nand hatred of us by using them. \"The Mussulmans, courteous and humane in\r\ntheir intercourse with each other,\" says Thornton, \"sternly refuse to\r\nunbelievers the salutation of peace.\" Not that they necessarily insult\r\nthe Christian, he adds, by this refusal; nay, he even insists that\r\npolished Turks are able to practise condescension; and then, as an\r\nillustration of their courtesy, he tells us that \"Mr. Eton, pleasantly\r\nand accurately enough, compared the general behaviour of a Turk to a\r\nChristian with that of a German baron to his vassal.\" However, he allows\r\nthat at least \"the common people, more bigoted to their dogmas, express\r\nmore bluntly their sense of superiority over the Christians.\" \"Their\r\nusual salutation addressed to Christians,\" says Volney, \"is 'good\r\nmorning;' but it is well if it be not accompanied with a Djaour, Kafer,\r\nor Kelb, that is, impious, infidel, dog, expressions to which\r\nChristians are familiarized.\" Sir C. Fellows is an earnest witness for\r\ntheir amiableness; but he does not conceal that the children \"hoot after\r\na European, and call him Frank dog, and even strike him;\" and on one\r\noccasion a woman caught up a child and ran off from him, crying out\r\nagainst the Ghiaour; which gives him an opportunity of telling us that\r\nthe word \"Ghiaour\" means a man without a soul, without a God. A writer\r\nin a popular Review, who seems to have been in the East, tells us that\r\n\"their hatred and contempt of the Ghiaour and Frangi is as burning as\r\never; perhaps even more so, because they are forced to implore his aid.\r\nThe Eastern seeks Christian aid in the same spirit and with the same\r\ndisgust as he would eat swine's flesh, were it the only means of\r\nsecuring him from starvation.\"[86] Such conduct is indeed only\r\nconsistent with their faith, and the untenableness of that faith is not\r\nmy present question; here I do but ask, are these barbarians likely to\r\nthink themselves inferior in any respect to men without souls? are they\r\nlikely to receive civilization from the nations of the West, whom,\r\naccording to the well-known story, they definitively divide into the hog\r\nand the dog?\r\n\r\nI have not time for more than an allusion to what is the complement of\r\nthis arrogance, and is a most pregnant subject of thought, whenever the\r\nfortunes of the Ottomans are contemplated; I mean the despair which\r\ntakes its place in their minds, consistently with the barbarian\r\ntemperament, upon the occurrence of any considerable reverses. A passage\r\nfrom Mr. Thornton just now quoted refers to this characteristic. The\r\noverthrow at Lepanto, though they rallied from their consternation for a\r\nwhile, was a far more serious and permanent misfortune in its moral\r\nthan in its material consequences. And, on any such national calamity,\r\nthe fatalism of their creed, to which I have already referred,\r\nconsecrates and fortifies their despair.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have been proving a point, which most persons would grant me, in thus\r\ninsisting on the essential barbarism of the Turks; but I have thought it\r\nworth while to insist on it under the feeling, that to prove it is at\r\nthe same time to describe it, and many persons will vaguely grant that\r\nthey are barbarous without having any clear idea what barbarism means.\r\nWith this view I draw out my formal conclusion:--If civilization be the\r\nascendancy of mind over passion and imagination; if it manifests itself\r\nin consistency of habit and action, and is characterised by a continual\r\nprogress or development of the principles on which it rests; and if, on\r\nthe other hand, the Turks alternate between sloth and energy,\r\nself-confidence and despair,--if they have two contrary characters\r\nwithin them, and pass from one to the other rapidly, and when they are\r\nthe one, are as if they could not be the other;--if they think\r\nthemselves, notwithstanding, to be the first nation upon earth, while at\r\nthe end of many centuries they are just what they were at the\r\nbeginning;--if they are so ignorant as not to know their ignorance, and\r\nso far from making progress that they have not even started, and so far\r\nfrom seeking instruction that they think no one fit to teach\r\nthem;--there is surely not much hazard in concluding, that, apart from\r\nthe consideration of any supernatural intervention, barbarians they have\r\nlived, and barbarians they will die.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[79] Formby's Visit, p. 70.\r\n\r\n[80] Bell's Geography.\r\n\r\n[81] Vid, Sir Charles Fellows' Asia Minor.\r\n\r\n[82] The correspondent of the _Times_ in February, 1854, speaking of the\r\ngreat arsenal of Rustchuk, observes: \"All the heavy smith work was done\r\nby Bulgarians, the light iron work by gipsies, the carpenters were all\r\nTurks, the sawyers Bulgarians, the tinmen all Jews.\"\r\n\r\n[83] Lib. iv. fin.\r\n\r\n[84] Sir C.

Yet, as mixed\r\nmathematics correct, without superseding, the pure science, so I do not\r\nsee why I may not allowably take a sort of pure philosophical view of\r\nthe Turks and their position, though it be but abstract and theoretical,\r\nand require correction when confronted by the event. There is a use in\r\ninvestigating what ought to be, under given suppositions and conditions,\r\neven though speculation and fact do not happen to keep pace together.\r\n\r\nAs to myself, having laid down my premisses, as drawn from historical\r\nconsiderations, I must needs go on, whether I will or no, to the\r\nconjectures to which they lead; and that shall be my business in this\r\nconcluding discussion. My line of argument has been as follows:--First,\r\nI stated some peculiarities of civilized and of barbarian communities; I\r\nsaid that it is a general truth that civilized states are destroyed from\r\nwithin, and barbarian states from without; that the very causes, which\r\nlead to the greatness of civilized communities, at length by continuing\r\nbecome their ruin, whereas the causes of barbarian greatness uphold\r\nthat greatness, as long as they continue, and by ceasing to act, not by\r\ncontinuing, lead the way to its overthrow. Thus the intellect of Athens\r\nfirst was its making and then its unmaking; while the warlike prowess of\r\nthe Spartans maintained their pre-eminence, till it succumbed to the\r\nantagonist prowess of Thebes.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\nI laid down this principle as a general law of human society, open to\r\nexceptions and requiring modifications in particular cases, but true on\r\nthe whole. Next, I went on to show that the Ottoman power was of a\r\nbarbarian character. The conclusion is obvious; viz., that it has risen,\r\nand will fall, not by anything within it, but by agents external to\r\nitself; and this conclusion, I certainly think, is actually confirmed by\r\nTurkish history, as far as it has hitherto gone. The Ottoman state\r\nseems, in matter of fact, to be most singularly constructed, so as to\r\nhave nothing inside of it, and to be moved solely or mainly by\r\ninfluences from without. What a contrast, for instance, to the German\r\nrace! In the earliest history of that people, we discern an element of\r\ncivilization, a vigorous action of the intellect residing in the body,\r\nindependent of individuals, and giving birth to great men, rather than\r\ncreated by them. Again, in the first three centuries of the Church, we\r\nfind martyrs indeed in plenty, as the Turks might have soldiers; but (to\r\nview the matter humanly) perhaps there was not one great mind, after the\r\nApostles, to teach and to mould her children. The highest intellects,\r\nOrigen, Tertullian, and Eusebius, were representatives of a philosophy\r\nnot hers; her greatest bishops, such as St. Gregory, St. Dionysius, and\r\nSt Cyprian, so little exercised a doctor's office, as to incur, however\r\nundeservedly, the imputation of doctrinal inaccuracy. Vigilant as was\r\nthe Holy See then, as in every age, yet there is no Pope, I may say,\r\nduring that period, who has impressed his character upon his generation;\r\nyet how well instructed, how precisely informed, how self-possessed an\r\noracle of truth, nevertheless, do we find the Church to be, when the\r\ngreat internal troubles of the fourth century required it! how\r\nunambiguous, how bold is the Christianity of the great Pontiffs, St.\r\nJulius, St. Damasus, St. Siricius, and St. Innocent; of the great\r\nDoctors, St. Athanasius; St. Basil, St. Ambrose, and St. Augustine! By\r\nwhat channels, then, had the divine philosophy descended down from the\r\nGreat Teacher through three centuries of persecution? First through the\r\nSee and Church of Peter, into which error never intruded (though Popes\r\nmight be little more than victims, to be hunted out and killed, as soon\r\nas made), and to which the faithful from all quarters of the world might\r\nhave recourse when difficulties arose, or when false teachers anywhere\r\nexalted themselves. But intercommunion was difficult, and comparatively\r\nrare in days like those, and of nothing is there less pretence of proof\r\nthan that the Holy See, while persecution raged, imposed a faith upon\r\nthe ecumenical body. Rather, in that earliest age, it was simply the\r\nliving spirit of the myriads of the faithful, none of them known to\r\nfame, who received from the disciples of our Lord, and husbanded so\r\nwell, and circulated so widely, and transmitted so faithfully,\r\ngeneration after generation, the once delivered apostolic faith; who\r\nheld it with such sharpness of outline and explicitness of detail, as\r\nenabled even the unlearned instinctively to discriminate between truth\r\nand error, spontaneously to reject the very shadow of heresy, and to be\r\nproof against the fascination of the most brilliant intellects, when\r\nthey would lead them out of the narrow way. Here, then, is a luminous\r\ninstance of what I mean by an energetic action from within.\r\n\r\nTake again the history of the Saracenic schools and parties, on which I\r\nhave already touched. Mr. Southgate considers the absence of religious\r\ncontroversy among the Turks, contrasted with its frequency of old among\r\nthe Saracens, as a proof of the decay of the spirit of Islam. I should\r\nrather refer the present apathy to the national temperament of the\r\nTurks, and set it down, with other instances I shall mention presently,\r\nas a result of their barbarism. Saracenic Mahometanism, on the contrary,\r\ngives me an apposite illustration of what I mean by an \"interior\"\r\npeople, if I may borrow a devotional word to express a philosophical\r\nidea. A barbarous nation has no \"interior,\" but the Saracens show us\r\nwhat a national \"interior\" is. \"In former ages,\" says the author to whom\r\nI have referred, Mr. Southgate, \"the bosom of Islamism was riven with\r\nnumerous feuds and schisms, some of which have originated from religious\r\ncontroversy, and others from political ambition. During the first\r\ncenturies of its existence, and while Mussulman learning flourished\r\nunder the patronage of the Caliphs, religious questions were discussed\r\nby the learned with all the proverbial virulence of theological hatred.\r\nThe chief of these questions respected the origin of the Koran, the\r\nnature of God, predestination and free will, and the grounds of human\r\nsalvation. The question, whether the Koran was created or eternal, rent\r\nfor a time the whole body of Islamism into twain, and gave rise to the\r\nmost violent persecutions.... Besides these religious contentions, which\r\ndivided the Mussulmans into parties, but seldom gave birth to sects,\r\nthere have sprung up, at different periods, avowed heresies, which\r\nflourished for a time, and for the most part died with their authors.\r\nOthers, stimulated by ambition only, have reared the standard of revolt,\r\nand under cover of some new religious dogma, propounded only to shield a\r\nselfish end, have sought to raise themselves to power. Most of these,\r\nwhether theological disputes, heresies, or civil rebellions, cloaked\r\nunder the name of religion, arose previously to the sixteenth\r\ncentury.\"[87]\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\nSuch is that internal peculiarity, the presence of which constitutes a\r\ncivilized, the absence a barbarous people; which makes a people great,\r\nand small again; and which, just consistently with the notion of their\r\nbeing barbarians, I cannot discern, for strength or for weakness, in the\r\nTurks. On the contrary, almost all the elements of their success, and\r\ninstruments of their downfall, are external to themselves. For instance,\r\ntheir religion, one of their principal bonds, owes nothing to them; it\r\nis, not only in substance, but in concrete shape, just what it was when\r\nit came to them. I cannot find that they have commented upon it; I\r\ncannot find that they are the channels of any of those famous traditions\r\nby which the Koran is interpreted, and which they themselves accept; or\r\nthat they have exercised their minds upon it at all, except so far as\r\nthey have been obliged, in a certain degree, to do so in the\r\nadministration of the law. It is true also that they have been obliged\r\nto choose to be Sunnites and not Shiahs; but, considering the latter\r\nsect arose in Persia, since the date of the Turkish occupation of\r\nConstantinople, it was really no choice at all. They have but remained\r\nas they were. Besides, the Shiahs maintain the hereditary transmission\r\nof the Caliphate, which would exclude the line of Othman from the\r\nsuccession--good reason then the Turks should be Sunnites; and the dates\r\nof the two events so nearly coincide, that one could even fancy that the\r\nShiahs actually arose in consequence of the Sultan Selim's carrying off\r\nthe last of the Abassides from Egypt, and gaining the transference of\r\nthe Caliphate from his captive. Besides, if it is worth while pursuing\r\nthe point, did they not remain Sunnites, they would have to abandon the\r\ntraditional or oral law, and must cease to use the labours of its four\r\ngreat doctors, which would be to bring upon themselves an incalculable\r\nextent of intellectual toil; for without recognized comments on the\r\nKoran, neither the religion nor the civil state could be made to work.\r\n\r\nThe divine right of the line of Othman is another of their special\r\npolitical bonds, and this too is shown by the following extract from a\r\nwell-known historian,[88] if it needs showing, to be simply external to\r\nthemselves: \"The origin of the Sultans,\" he says, \"is obscure; but this\r\nsacred and indefeasible right\" to the throne, \"which no time can erase,\r\nand no violence can infringe, was soon and unalterably implanted in the\r\nminds of their subjects. A weak or vicious Sultan may be deposed and\r\nstrangled, but his inheritance devolves to an infant or an idiot; nor\r\nhas the most daring rebel presumed to ascend the throne of his lawful\r\nsovereign. While the transient dynasties of Asia have been continually\r\nsubverted by a crafty visir in the palace, or a victorious general in\r\nthe camp, the Ottoman succession has been confirmed by the practice of\r\nfive centuries, and is now incorporated with the vital principle of the\r\nTurkish nation.\" Here we have on the one hand the imperial succession\r\ndescribed as an element of the political life of the Osmanlis--on the\r\nother as an appointment over which they have no power; and obviously it\r\nis from its very nature independent of them. It is a form of life\r\nexternal to the community it vivifies.\r\n\r\nProbably it was the wonderful continuity of so many great Sultans in\r\ntheir early ages, which wrought in their minds the idea of a divine\r\nmission as the attribute of the dynasty; and its acquisition of the\r\nCaliphate would fix it indelibly within them. And here again, we have\r\nanother special instrument of their imperial greatness, but still an\r\nexternal one. I have already had occasion to observe, that barbarians\r\nmake conquests by means of great men, in whom they, as it were, live;\r\nten successive monarchs, of extraordinary vigour and talent, carried on\r\nthe Ottomans to empire. Will any one show that those monarchs can be\r\nfairly called specimens of the nation, any more than Zingis was the\r\nspecimen of the Tartars? Have they not rather acted as the _Deus è\r\nmachinâ_, carrying on the drama, which has languished or stopped, since\r\nthe time when they ceased to animate it? Contrast the Ottoman history in\r\nthis respect with the rise of the Anglo-Indian Empire, or with the\r\nmilitary successes of Great Britain under the Regency; or again with the\r\nliterary eminence of England under Charles the Second or even Anne,\r\nwhich owed little to those monarchs. Kings indeed at various periods\r\nhave been most effective patrons of art and science; but the question\r\nis, not whether English or French literature has ever been indebted to\r\nroyal encouragement, but whether the Ottomans can do anything at all, as\r\na nation, without it.\r\n\r\nIndeed, I should like it investigated what internal history the Ottomans\r\nhave at all; what inward development of any kind they have made since\r\nthey crossed Mount Olympus and planted themselves in Broussa; how they\r\nhave changed shape and feature, even in lesser matters, since they were\r\na state, or how they are a year older than when they first came into\r\nbeing. We see among them no representative of Confucius, Chi-hoagti, and\r\nthe sect of Ta-osse; no magi; no Pisistratus and Harmodius; no Socrates\r\nand Alcibiades; no patricians and plebeians; no Cæsar; no invasion or\r\nadoption of foreign mysteries; no mythical impersonation of an Ali; no\r\nSuffeeism; no Guelphs and Gibellines; nothing really on the type of\r\nCatholic religious orders; no Luther; nothing, in short, which, for good\r\nor evil, marks the presence of a life internal to the political\r\ncommunity itself. Some authors indeed maintain they have a literature;\r\nbut I cannot ascertain what the assertion is worth. Rather the tenor of\r\ntheir annals runs thus:--Two Pachas make war against each other, and a\r\nkat-sherif comes from Constantinople for the head of the one or the\r\nother; or a Pacha exceeds in pillaging his province, or acts\r\nrebelliously, and is preferred to a higher government and suddenly\r\nstrangled on his way to it; or he successfully maintains himself, and\r\ngains an hereditary settlement, still subject, however, to the feudal\r\ntenure, which is the principle of the political structure, continuing to\r\nsend his contingent of troops, when the Sultan goes to war, and\r\nremitting the ordinary taxes through his agent at Court. Such is the\r\nstaple of Turkish history, whether amid the hordes of Turkistan, or the\r\nfeudatory Turcomans of Anatolia, or the imperial Osmanlis.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\nThe remark I am making applies to them, not only as a nation, but as a\r\nbody politic. When they descended on horseback upon the rich territories\r\nwhich they occupy, they had need to become agriculturists, and miners,\r\nand civil engineers, and traders; all which they were not; yet I do not\r\nfind that they have attempted any of these functions themselves. Public\r\nworks, bridges, and roads, draining, levelling, building, they seem\r\nalmost entirely to have neglected; where, however, to do something was\r\nimperative, instead of applying themselves to their new position, and\r\nmanifesting native talent for each emergency, they usually have had\r\nrecourse to foreign assistance to execute what was uncongenial or\r\ndishonourable to themselves. The Franks were their merchants, the\r\nArmenians their bankers, the subject races their field labourers, and\r\nthe Greeks their sailors. \"Almost the whole business of the ship,\" says\r\nThornton, \"is performed by the slaves, or by the Greeks who are retained\r\nupon wages.\"\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable instance of this reluctance to develop from\r\nwithin--remarkable, both for the originality, boldness, success, and\r\npermanence of the policy adopted, and for its appositeness to my\r\npurpose--is the institution of the Janizaries, detestable as it was in a\r\nmoral point of view. I enlarge upon it here because it is at the same\r\ntime a palmary instance of the practical ability and wisdom of their\r\ngreat Sultans, exerted in compensation of the resourceless impotence of\r\nthe barbarians whom they governed. The Turks were by nature nothing\r\nbetter than horsemen; infantry they could not be; an infantry their\r\nSultans hardly attempted to form out of them; but since infantry was\r\nindispensable in European warfare, they availed themselves of passages\r\nin their own earlier history, and provided themselves with a perpetual\r\nsupply of foot soldiers from without. Of this procedure they were not,\r\nstrictly speaking, the originators; they took the idea of it from the\r\nSaracens. You may recollect that, when their ancestors were defeated by\r\nthe latter people in Sogdiana, instead of returning to their deserts,\r\nthey suffered themselves to be diffused and widely located through the\r\ngreat empire of the Caliphs. Whether as slaves, or as captives, or as\r\nmercenaries, they were taken into favour by the dominant nation, and\r\nemployed as soldiers or civilians. They were chosen as boys or youths\r\nfor their handsome appearance, turned into Mahometans, and educated for\r\nthe army or other purposes. And thus the strength of the empire which\r\nthey served was always kept fresh and vigorous, by the continual\r\ninfusion into it of new blood to perform its functions; a skilful\r\npolicy, if the servants could be hindered from becoming masters.\r\n\r\nMasters in time they did become, and then they adopted a similar system\r\nthemselves; we find traces of it even in the history of the Gaznevide\r\ndynasty. In the reign of the son of the great Mahmood, we read of an\r\ninsurrection of the slaves; who, conspiring with one of his nobles,\r\nseized his best horses, and rode off to his enemies. \"By slaves,\" says\r\nDow, in translating this history, \"are meant the captives and young\r\nchildren, bought by kings, and educated for the offices of state. They\r\nwere often adopted by the Emperors, and very frequently succeeded to the\r\nEmpire. A whole dynasty of these possessed afterwards the throne in\r\nHindostan.\"\r\n\r\nThe same system appears in Egypt, about or soon after the time of the\r\ncelebrated Saladin. Zingis, in his dreadful expedition from Khorasan to\r\nSyria and Russia, had collected an innumerable multitude of youthful\r\ncaptives, who glutted, as we may say, the markets of Asia. This gave the\r\nconquerors of Egypt an opportunity of forming a mercenary or foreign\r\nforce for their defence, on a more definite idea than seems hitherto to\r\nhave been acted upon. Saladin was a Curd, and, as such, a neighbour of\r\nthe Caucasus; hence the Caucasian tribes became for many centuries the\r\nstore-houses of Egyptian mercenaries. A detestable slave trade has\r\nexisted with this object, especially among the Circassians, since the\r\ntime of the Moguls; and of these for the most part this Egyptian force,\r\nMamlouks, as they are called, has consisted. After a time, these\r\nMamlouks took matters into their own hands, and became a self-elective\r\nbody, or sort of large corporation. They were masters of the country,\r\nand of its nominal ruler, and they recruited their ranks continually,\r\nand perpetuated their power, by means of the natives of the Caucasus,\r\nslaves like themselves, and of their own race.\r\n\r\n\"During the 500 or 600 years,\" says Volney, \"that there have been\r\nMamlouks in Egypt, not one of them has left subsisting issue; there does\r\nnot exist one single family of them in the second generation; all their\r\nchildren perish in the first and second descent. The means therefore by\r\nwhich they are perpetuated and multiplied were of necessity the same by\r\nwhich they were first established.\" These troops have been massacred and\r\ngot rid of in the memory of the last generation; towards the end of last\r\ncentury they formed a body of above 8,500 men. The writer I have just\r\nbeen quoting adds the following remarks:--\"Born for the most part in the\r\nrites of the Greek Church, and circumcised the moment they are bought,\r\nthey are considered by the Turks themselves as renegades, void of faith\r\nand of religion. Strangers to each other, they are not bound by those\r\nnatural ties which unite the rest of mankind. Without parents, without\r\nchildren, the past has nothing to do for them, and they do nothing for\r\nthe future. Ignorant and superstitious from education, they become\r\nferocious from the murders they commit, and corrupted by the most\r\nhorrible debauchery.\" On the other hand, they had every sort of\r\nincentive and teaching to prompt them to rapacity and lawlessness. \"The\r\nyoung peasant, sold in Mingrelia or Georgia, no sooner arrives in Egypt,\r\nthan his ideas undergo a total alteration. A new and extraordinary scene\r\nopens before him, where everything conduces to awaken his audacity and\r\nambition. Though now a slave, he seems destined to become a master, and\r\nalready assumes the spirit of his future condition. No sooner is a slave\r\nenfranchised, than he aspires to the principal employments; and who is\r\nto oppose his pretensions? and he will be no less able than his betters\r\nin the art of governing, which consists only in taking money, and giving\r\nblows with the sabre.\"\r\n\r\nIn describing the Mamlouks I have been in a great measure describing the\r\nJanizaries, and have little to add to the picture. When Amurath, one of\r\nthe ten Sultans, had made himself master of the territory round\r\nConstantinople, as far as the Balkan, he passed northwards, and subdued\r\nthe warlike tribes which possessed Bulgaria, Servia, Bosnia, and the\r\nneighbouring provinces. These countries had neither the precious metals\r\nin their mountains, nor marts of commerce; but their inhabitants were a\r\nbrave and hardy race, who had been for ages the terror of\r\nConstantinople. It was suggested to the Sultan, that, according to the\r\nMahometan law, he was entitled to a fifth part of the captives, and he\r\nmade this privilege the commencement of a new institution. Twelve\r\nthousand of the strongest and handsomest youths were selected as his\r\nshare; he formed them into a military force; he made them abjure\r\nChristianity, he consecrated them with a religious rite, and named them\r\nJanizaries. The discipline to which they were submitted was peculiar,\r\nand in some respects severe. They were in the first instance made over\r\nto the peasantry to assist them in the labours of the field, and thus\r\nwere prepared by penury and hard fare for the privations of a military\r\nlife. After this introduction, they were drafted into the companies of\r\nthe Janizaries, but only in order to commence a second noviciate.\r\nSometimes they were employed in the menial duties of the palace,\r\nsometimes in the public works, sometimes in the dockyards, and sometimes\r\nin the imperial gardens. Meanwhile they were taught their new religion,\r\nand were submitted to the drill. When at length they went on service,\r\nthe road to promotion was opened upon them; nor were military honours\r\nthe only recompense to which they might aspire. There are examples in\r\nhistory, of men from the ranks attaining the highest dignities in the\r\nstate, and at least of one of them marrying the sister of the Sultan.\r\n\r\nThis corps has constituted the main portion of the infantry of the\r\nOttoman armies for a period of nearly five hundred years; till, in our\r\nown day, on account of its repeated turbulence, it was annihilated, as\r\nthe Mamlouks before it, by means of a barbarous massacre. Its end was as\r\nstrange as its constitution; but here it comes under our notice as a\r\nsingular exemplification of the unproductiveness, as I may call it, of\r\nthe Turkish intellect. It was nothing else but an external institution\r\ndevised to supply a need which a civilized state would have supplied\r\nfrom its own resources; and it fell perhaps without any essential\r\nprejudice to the integrity of the power which it had served. That power\r\nis just what it was before the Janizaries were formed. They may still\r\nfall back upon the powerful cavalry, which carried them all the way from\r\nTurkistan; or they may proceed to employ a mercenary force; anyhow their\r\nprimitive social type remains inviolate.\r\n\r\nSuch is the strange phenomenon, or rather portent, presented to us by\r\nthe barbarian power which has been for centuries seated in the very\r\nheart of the old world; which has in its brute clutch the most famous\r\ncountries of classical and religious antiquity, and many of the most\r\nfruitful and beautiful regions of the earth; which stretches along the\r\ncourse of the Danube, the Euphrates, and the Nile; which embraces the\r\nPindus, the Taurus, the Caucasus, Mount Sinai, the Libyan mountains, and\r\nthe Atlas, as far as the Pillars of Hercules; and which, having no\r\nhistory itself, is heir to the historical names of Constantinople and\r\nNicæa, Nicomedia and Cæsarea, Jerusalem and Damascus, Nineveh and\r\nBabylon, Mecca and Bagdad, Antioch and Alexandria, ignorantly holding in\r\npossession one-half of the history of the whole world. There it lies and\r\nwill not die, and has not in itself the elements of death, for it has\r\nthe life of a stone, and, unless pounded and pulverized, is\r\nindestructible. Such is it in the simplicity of its national existence,\r\nwhile that mode of existence remains, while it remains faithful to its\r\nreligion and its imperial line. Should its fidelity to either fail, it\r\nwould not merely degenerate or decay; it would simply cease to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\nBut we have dwelt long enough on the internal peculiarities of the\r\nOttomans; now let us shift the scene, and view them in the presence of\r\ntheir enemies, and in their external relations both above and below\r\nthem; and then at once a very different prospect presents itself for our\r\ncontemplation. However, the first remark I have to make is one which has\r\nreference still to their internal condition, but which does not properly\r\ncome into consideration, till we place them in the presence of rival\r\nand hostile nations and races. Moral degeneracy is not, strictly\r\nspeaking, a cause of political ruin, as I have already said; but its\r\nexistence is of course a point of the gravest importance, when we would\r\ncalculate the chance which a people has of standing the brunt of war and\r\ninsurrection. It is a natural question to ask whether the Osmanlis,\r\nafter centuries of indulgence, have the physical nerve and mental vigour\r\nwhich carried them forward through such a course of fortunes, till it\r\nenthroned them in three quarters of the world. Their numbers are\r\ndiminished and diminishing; their great cities are half emptied; their\r\nvillages have disappeared; I believe that even out of the fraction of\r\nMahometans to be found amid their European population, but a miserable\r\nminority are Osmanlis. Too much stress, however, must not be laid on\r\nthis circumstance. Though the Osmanlis are the conquering race, it\r\nrequires to be shown that they have ever had much to do, as a race, with\r\nthe executive of the Empire. While there are some vigorous minds at the\r\nhead of affairs, while there is a constant introduction of foreigners\r\ninto posts of authority and power, while Curd and Turcoman supply the\r\ncavalry, while Egypt and other Pachalics send their contingents, while\r\nthe government can manage to combine, or to steer between, the\r\nfanaticism of its subjects and the claims of European diplomacy, there\r\nis a certain counterbalance in the State to the depravity and\r\nworthlessness, whatever it be, of those who have the nominal power.\r\n\r\nA far more formidable difficulty, when we survey their external\r\nprospects, is that very peculiarity, which, internally considered, is so\r\nmuch in their favour--the simplicity of their internal unity, and the\r\nindividuality of their political structure. The Turkish races, as being\r\nconquerors, of course are only a portion of the whole population of\r\ntheir empire; for four centuries they have remained distinct from\r\nSlavonians, Greeks, Copts, Armenians, Curds, Arabs, Jews, Druses,\r\nMaronites, Ansarians, Motoualis; and they never can coalesce with them.\r\nLike other Empires, they have kept their sovereign position by the\r\ninsignificance, degeneracy, or mutual animosities of the several\r\ncountries and religions which they rule, and by the ruthless tyranny of\r\ntheir government. Were they to relax that tyranny, were they to\r\nrelinquish their ascendancy, were they to place their Greek subjects,\r\nfor instance, on a civil equality with themselves, how in the nature of\r\nthings could two incommunicable races coexist beside each other in one\r\npolitical community? Yet if, on the other hand, they refuse this\r\nenfranchisement of their subjects, they will have to encounter the\r\ndispleasure of united Christendom.\r\n\r\nNor is it a mere question of political practicability or expedience:\r\nwill the Koran, in its laxest interpretation, admit of that toleration,\r\non which the Frank kingdoms insist? yet what and where are they without\r\nthe Koran?\r\n\r\nNor do we understand the full stress of the dilemma in which they are\r\nplaced, until we have considered what is meant by the demands and the\r\ndispleasure of the European community. Pledged by the very principle of\r\ntheir existence to barbarism, the Turks have to cope with civilized\r\ngovernments all around them, ever advancing in the material and moral\r\nstrength which civilization gives, and ever feeling more and more\r\nvividly that the Turks are simply in the way. They are in the way of the\r\nprogress of the nineteenth century. They are in the way of the Russians,\r\nwho wish to get into the Mediterranean; they are in the way of the\r\nEnglish, who wish to cross to the East; they are in the way of the\r\nFrench, who, from the Crusades to Napoleon, have felt a romantic\r\ninterest in Syria; they are in the way of the Austrians, their\r\nhereditary foes. There they lie, unable to abandon their traditionary\r\nprinciples, without simply ceasing to be a state; unable to retain them,\r\nand retain the sympathy of Christendom;--Mahometans, despots, slave\r\nmerchants, polygamists, holding agriculture in contempt, Europe in\r\nabomination, their own wretched selves in admiration, cut off from the\r\nfamily of nations,[89] existing by ignorance and fanaticism, and\r\ntolerated in existence by the mutual jealousies of Christian powers as\r\nwell as of their own subjects, and by the recurring excitement of\r\nmilitary and political combinations, which cannot last for ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.\r\n\r\nAnd, last of all, as if it were not enough to be unable to procure the\r\ncountenance of any Christian power, except on specific conditions\r\nprejudicial to their existence, still further, as the alternative of\r\ntheir humbling themselves before the haughty nations of the West whom\r\nthey abhor, they have to encounter the direct cupidity, hatred, and\r\noverpowering pressure of the multitudinous North, with its fanaticism\r\nalmost equal, and its numbers superior, to their own; a peril more awful\r\nin imagination, from the circumstance that its descent has been for so\r\nmany centuries foretold and commenced, and of late years so widely\r\nacquiesced in as inevitable. Seven centuries and a half have passed,\r\nsince, at the very beginning of the Crusades, a Greek writer still\r\nextant turns from the then menacing inroads of the Turks in the East,\r\nand the long centuries of their triumph which lay in prospect, to record\r\na prophecy, old in his time, relating to the North, to the effect that\r\nin the last days the Russians should be masters of Constantinople. When\r\nit was uttered no one knows; but it was written on an equestrian statue,\r\nin his day one of the special monuments of the Imperial City, which had\r\none time been brought thither from Antioch. That statue, whether of\r\nChristian or pagan origin is not known, has a name in history, for it\r\nwas one of the works of art destroyed by the Latins in the taking of\r\nConstantinople; and the prediction engraven on it bears at least a\r\nremarkable evidence of the congruity in itself, if I may use the word;\r\nof that descent of the North upon Constantinople, which, though not as\r\nyet accomplished, generation after generation grows more probable.\r\n\r\nIt is now a thousand years since this famous prophecy has been\r\nillustrated by the actual incursions of the Russian hordes. Such was the\r\ndate of their first expedition against Constantinople; their assaults\r\ncontinued through two centuries; and, in the course of that period, they\r\nseemed to be nearer the capture of the city than they have been at any\r\ntime since. They descended the Dnieper in boats, coasted along the East\r\nof the Black Sea, and so came round by Trebizond to the Bosphorus,\r\nplundering the coast as they advanced. At one time their sovereign had\r\ngot possession of Bulgaria, to the south of the Danube. Barbarians of\r\nother races flocked to his standard; he found himself surrounded by the\r\nluxuries of the East and West, and he marched down as far as Adrianople,\r\nand threatened to go further. Ultimately he was defeated; then followed\r\nthe conversion of his people to Christianity, which for a period\r\nrestrained their barbarous rapacity; after this, for two centuries, they\r\nwere under the yoke and bondage of the Tartars; but the prophecy, or\r\nrather the omen, remains, and the whole world has learned to acquiesce\r\nin the probability of its fulfilment. The wonder rather is, that that\r\nfulfilment has been so long delayed. The Russians, whose wishes would\r\ninspire their hopes, are not solitary in their anticipations: the\r\nhistorian from whom I have borrowed this sketch of their past\r\nattempts,[90] writing at the end of last century, records his own\r\nexpectation of the event. \"Perhaps,\" he says, \"the present generation\r\nmay yet behold the accomplishment of a rare prediction, of which the\r\nstyle is unambiguous and the date unquestionable.\" The Turks themselves\r\nhave long been under the shadow of its influence; even as early as the\r\nmiddle of the seventeenth century, when they were powerful, and Austria\r\nand Poland also, and Russia distant and comparatively feeble, a\r\ntraveller tells us that, \"of all the princes of Christendom, there was\r\nnone whom the Turks so much feared as the Czar of Muscovy.\" This\r\napprehension has ever been on the increase; in favour of Russia, they\r\nmade the first formal renunciation of territory which had been\r\nconsecrated to Islam by the solemnities of religion,--a circumstance\r\nwhich has sunk deep into their imaginations; there is an enigmatical\r\ninscription on the tomb of the Great Constantine, to the effect that\r\n\"the yellow-haired race shall overthrow Ismael;\" moreover, ever since\r\ntheir defeats by the Emperor Leopold, they have had a surmise that the\r\ntrue footing of their faith is in Asia; and so strong is the popular\r\nfeeling on the subject, that in consequence their favourite cemetery is\r\nat Scutari on the Asiatic coast.[91]\r\n\r\n\r\n6.\r\n\r\nIt seems likely, then, at no very remote day, to fare ill with the old\r\nenemy of the Cross. However, we must not undervalue what is still the\r\nstrength of his position. First, no well-authenticated tokens come to us\r\nof the decay of the Mahometan faith. It is true that in one or two\r\ncities, in Constantinople, perhaps, or in the marts of commerce, laxity\r\nof opinion and general scepticism may to a certain extent prevail, as\r\nalso in the highest class of all, and in those who have most to do with\r\nEuropeans; but I confess nothing has been brought home to me to show\r\nthat this superstition is not still a living, energetic principle in the\r\nTurkish population, sufficient to bind them together in one, and to lead\r\nto bold and persevering action. It must be recollected that a national\r\nand local faith, like the Mahometan, is most closely connected with the\r\nsentiments of patriotism, family honour, loyalty towards the past, and\r\nparty spirit; and this the more in the case of a religion which has no\r\narticles of faith at all, except those of the Divine Unity and the\r\nmission of Mahomet. To these must be added more general considerations:\r\nthat they have ever prospered under their religion, that they are\r\nhabituated to it, that it suits them, that it is their badge of a\r\nstanding antagonism to nations they abhor, and that it places them, in\r\ntheir own imagination, in a spiritual position relatively to those\r\nnations, which they would simply forfeit if they abandoned it. It would\r\nrequire clear proof of the fact, to credit in their instance the report\r\nof a change of mind, which antecedently is so improbable.\r\n\r\nAnd next it must be borne in mind that, few as may be the Osmanlis, yet\r\nthe raw material of the Turkish nation, represented principally by the\r\nTurcomans, extends over half Asia; and, if it is what it ever has been,\r\nmight under circumstances be combined or concentrated into a formidable\r\nPower. It extends at this day from Asia Minor, in a continuous tract, to\r\nthe Lena, towards Kamtchatka, and from Siberia down to Khorasan, the\r\nHindu Cush, and China. The Nogays on the north-east of the Danube, the\r\ninhabitants of the Crimea, the populations on each side of the Don and\r\nWolga, the wandering Turcomans who are found from the west of Asia,\r\nalong the Euxine, Caspian, and so through Persia into Bukharia, the\r\nKirghies on the Jaxartes, are said to speak one tongue, and to have one\r\nfaith.[92] Religion is a bond of union, and language is a medium of\r\nintercourse; and, what is still more, they are all Sunnites, and\r\nrecognize in the Sultan the successor of Mahomet.\r\n\r\nWithout a head, indeed, to give them a formal unity, they are only one\r\nin name. Nothing is less likely than a resuscitation of the effete\r\nfamily of Othman; still, supposing the Ottomans driven into Asia, and a\r\nSultan of that race to mount the throne, such as Amurath, Mahomet, or\r\nSelim, it is not easy to set bounds to the influence the Sovereign\r\nPontiff of Islam might exert, and to the successes he might attain, in\r\nrallying round him the scattered members of a race, warlike, fanatical,\r\none in faith, in language, in habits, and in adversity. Nay, even\r\nsupposing the Turkish Caliph, like the Saracenic of old, still to\r\nslumber in his seraglio, he might appoint a vicegerent, Emir-ul-Omra, or\r\nMayor of the Palace, such as Togrul Beg, to conquer with his authority\r\nin his stead.\r\n\r\nBut, supposing great men to be wanting to the Turkish race, and the\r\ndespair, natural to barbarians, to rush upon them, and defeat,\r\nhumiliation, and flight to be their lot; supposing the rivalries and\r\ndissensions of Pachas, in themselves arguing no disaffection to their\r\nSultan and Caliph, should practically lead to the success of their too\r\npowerful foes, to the divulsion of their body politic, and the partition\r\nof their territory; should this be the distant event to which the\r\npresent complications tend, then the fiercer spirits, I suppose, would\r\nof their free will return into the desert, as a portion of the Kalmucks\r\nhave done within the last hundred years. Those, however, who remained,\r\nwould lead the easiest life under the protection of Russia. She already\r\nis the sovereign ruler of many barbarian populations, and, among them,\r\nTurks and Mahometans; she lets them pursue their wandering habits\r\nwithout molestation, satisfied with such service on their part as the\r\ninterests of the empire require. The Turcomans would have the same\r\npermission, and would hardly be sensible of the change of masters. It is\r\na more perplexing question how England or France, did they on the other\r\nhand become their masters, would be able to tolerate them in their\r\nreckless desolation of a rich country. Rather, such barbarians, unless\r\nthey could be placed where they would answer some political purpose,\r\nwould eventually share the fate of the aboriginal inhabitants of North\r\nAmerica; they would, in the course of years, be surrounded, pressed\r\nupon, divided, decimated, driven into the desert by the force of\r\ncivilization, and would once more roam in freedom in their old home in\r\nPersia or Khorasan, in the presence of their brethren, who have long\r\nsucceeded them in its possession.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMany things are possible; one thing is inconceivable,--that the Turks\r\nshould, as an existing nation, accept of modern civilization; and, in\r\ndefault of it, that they should be able to stand their ground amid the\r\nencroachments of Russia, the interested and contemptuous patronage of\r\nEurope, and the hatred of their subject populations.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[87] Tour through Armenia, etc.\r\n\r\n[88] Gibbon.\r\n\r\n[89] Since this was written, they have been taken into the European\r\nfamily by the Treaty of 1856, and the Sultan has become a Knight of the\r\nGarter. This strange phenomenon is not for certain to the advantage of\r\ntheir political position.\r\n\r\n[90] Gibbon.\r\n\r\n[91] Thornton, ii. 89; Formby, p. 24; Eclectic Rev., Dec., 1828.\r\n\r\n[92] Pritchard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE ON PAGE 109.\r\n\r\n\r\nCardinal Fisher, in his _Assert.

He was presented to Sultan Abdoul Medjid in February, 1848. He says:\r\n\"On the left hung a gorgeous crimson velvet curtain, embroidered and\r\nfringed with gold\" [the ancient Tartar one was of felt], \"and towards it\r\nthe secretary led the way. His countenance and his manner exhibited more\r\nawe than I had ever seen depicted in the human countenance. He seemed to\r\nhold his breath; and his step was so soft and stealthy, that once or\r\ntwice I stopped, under the impression that I had left him behind, but\r\nfound him ever beside me. There were three of us in close proximity, and\r\nthe stairway was lined with officers and attendants; but such was the\r\ndeath-like stillness that I could distinctly hear my own foot-fall. If\r\nit had been a wild beast slumbering in his lair that we were about to\r\nvisit, there could not have been a silence more deeply hushed.\"\r\n\r\n2. \"I presented him, in the name of the President of the United States,\r\nwith some biographies and prints, illustrative of the character and\r\nhabits of our North American Indians, the work of American artists. He\r\nlooked at some of them ... and said that he considered them as evidences\r\nof the advancement of the United States in _civilization_, and would\r\ntreasure them as a souvenir of the good feeling of its Government\r\ntowards him. At the word 'civilization,' pronounced in French, I\r\nstarted, for it seemed singular, coming from the lips of a Turk, and\r\napplied to our country.\" The author accounts for it by observing that\r\nthe Sultan is but a beginner in French, and probably meant by\r\n\"civilization\" arts and sciences.\r\n\r\n3. He saw the old Tartar throne, which puts one in mind of Attila's\r\nqueen, Zingis's lieutenant, and Timour. \"The old divan, upon which the\r\nSultans formerly reclined when they gave audience, looks like an\r\novergrown four-poster, covered with carbuncles, turquoise, amethysts,\r\ntopaz, emeralds, ruby, and diamond: the couch was covered with Damascus\r\nsilk and Cashmere shawls.\"\r\n\r\n4. \"Anchored in the Bay of Scio. In the afternoon, the weather partially\r\nmoderating, visited the shore. From the ship we had enjoyed a view of\r\nrich orchards and green fields; but on landing we found ourselves amid a\r\nscene of desolation.... We rode into the country.... What a contrast\r\nbetween the luxuriant vegetation, the bounty of nature, and the\r\ndevastation of man! Nearly every house was unroofed and in ruins, not\r\none in ten inhabited, although surrounded with thick groves of\r\norange-trees loaded with the weight of their golden fruit.\"\r\n\r\n\"While weather-bound, we availed ourselves of the opportunity to visit\r\nthe ruins [of Ephesus]. There are no trees and but very few bushes on\r\nthe face of this old country, but the mountain-slopes and the valleys\r\nare enamelled with thousands of beautiful flowers.... Winding round the\r\nprecipitous crest of a mountain, we saw the river Cayster ... flowing\r\nthrough the alluvial plain to the sea, and on its banks the black tents\r\nof herdsmen, with their flocks of goats around them.\" As Chandler had\r\nseen them there ninety years ago.\r\n\r\n5. \"The tomb of Mahmood is a sarcophagus about eight feet high and as\r\nmany long, covered with purple cloth embroidered in gold, and many\r\nvotive shawls of the richest cashmere thrown over it.... At the head is\r\nthe crimson tarbouch which the monarch wore in life, with a lofty plume,\r\nsecured by a large and lustrous aigrette of diamonds. The following\r\nwords are inscribed in letters of gold on the face of the tomb:--'This\r\nis the tomb of the layer of the basis of the civilization of his empire;\r\nof the monarch of exalted place, the Sultan victorious and just, Mahmood\r\nKhan, son of the victorious Abd' al Hamid Khan. May the Almighty make\r\nhis abode in the gardens of Paradise! Born,' etc.\"\r\n\r\n\"From the eager employment of Franks, the introduction of foreign\r\nmachinery, and the adoption of improved modes of cultivating the land,\r\nthe present Sultan gives the strongest assurance of his anxiety to\r\npromote the welfare of his people.\"\r\n\r\nSan Stefano \"possesses two things in its near vicinity, of peculiar\r\ninterest to an American--a model farm and an agricultural school. The\r\nfarm consists of about 2,000 acres of land, especially appropriated to\r\nthe culture of the cotton-plant. Both farm and school are under the\r\nsuperintendence of Dr. Davis of South Carolina.... Besides the principal\r\nculture, he is sedulously engaged in the introduction of seeds, plants,\r\ndomestic animals, and agricultural instruments. The school is held in\r\none of the kiosks of the Sultan, which overlooks the sea.\"\r\n\r\nAt Jaffa, Dr. Kayat, H.B.M. Consul, \"has encouraged the culture of the\r\nvine; has introduced that of the mulberry and of the Irish potato; and\r\nby word and example is endeavouring to prevail on the people in the\r\nadjacent plain to cultivate the sweet potato.... In the court-yard we\r\nobserved an English plough of improved construction.\"\r\n\r\nHe speaks in several places of the remains of the terrace cultivation\r\n(vid. above, p. 128) of Palestine.\r\n\r\n6. \"We visited the barracks, where a large number of Turkish soldiers,\r\nshaved and dressed like Europeans except the moustache and the tarbouch,\r\nreceived us with the Asiatic salute.... The whole caserne was\r\nscrupulously clean, the bread dark coloured, but well baked and sweet.\r\nThe colonel, who politely accompanied us, said that the bastinado had\r\nbeen discontinued, on account of its injuring the culprit's eyes.\"\r\n\r\n... \"Here,\" in the Palace, \"we saw the last of the White Eunuchs; the\r\npresent enlightened Sultan having pensioned off those on hand, and\r\ndiscontinued their attendance for ever.\"\r\n\r\n\"In an extensive, but nearly vacant building, was an abortive attempt at\r\na museum.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is said, but untruly, that the slave market of Constantinople has\r\nbeen abolished. An edict, it is true, was some years since promulgated,\r\nwhich declared the purchase and sale of slaves to be unlawful; the\r\nprohibition, however, is only operative against the Franks, under which\r\nterm the Greeks are included.\"\r\n\r\n7. \"Every coloured person, employed by the Government, receives monthly\r\nwages; and, if a slave, is emancipated at the expiration of seven years,\r\nwhen he becomes eligible to any office beneath the sovereignty. Many of\r\nthe high dignitaries of the empire were originally slaves; the present\r\nGovernor of the Dardanelles is a black, and was, a short time since,\r\nfreed from servitude.\"\r\n\r\n\"The secretary had the most prepossessing countenance of any Turk I had\r\nyet seen, and in conversation evinced a spirit of inquiry and an amount\r\nof intelligence that far surpassed my expectations.... His history is a\r\npleasing one. He was a poor boy, a charity scholar in one of the public\r\nschools. The late Sultan Mahmood requiring a page to fill a vacancy in\r\nhis suite, directed the appointment to be given to the most intelligent\r\npupil. The present secretary was the fortunate one; and by his\r\nabilities, his suavity and discretion, has risen to the highest office\r\nnear the person of majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGICAL TABLES.\r\n\r\n[The dates, as will be seen, are fixed on no scientific principal, but\r\nare taken as they severally occur in approved authors.]\r\n\r\nOUTLINES OF TURKISH CHRONOLOGY.\r\n\r\n                                                                A.D.\r\n\r\n  I.

Dr.\r\nWhately explained to him that the Editor had suddenly been disappointed\r\nin the article on Cicero which was to have appeared in the\r\n_Encyclopædia_, and that in consequence he could not allow more than two\r\nmonths for the composition of the paper which was to take its place;\r\nalso, that it must contain such and such subjects. The Author undertook\r\nand finished it under these conditions.\r\n\r\nIn the present Edition (1872) he has in some places availed himself of\r\nthe excellent translations of its Greek and Latin passages, made by the\r\nReverend Henry Thompson in the Edition of 1852.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCUS TULLIUS CICERO\r\n\r\n                                                               PAGE\r\n\r\n  1.

THE ORATORS OF ROME,  § 13                                 297\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCUS TULLIUS CICERO.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\nMarcus Tullius Cicero was born at Arpinum, the native place of\r\nMarius,[93] in the year of Rome 648 (A.C. 106), the same year which gave\r\nbirth to the Great Pompey. His family was ancient and of Equestrian\r\nrank, but had never taken part in the public affairs of Rome,[94] though\r\nboth his father and grandfather were persons of consideration in the\r\npart of Italy to which they belonged.[95] His father, being a man of\r\ncultivated mind himself, determined to give his two sons the advantage\r\nof a liberal education, and to fit them for the prospect of those public\r\nemployments which a feeble constitution incapacitated himself from\r\nundertaking. Marcus, the elder of the two, soon displayed indications of\r\na superior intellect, and we are told that his schoolfellows carried\r\nhome such accounts of him, that their parents often visited the school\r\nfor the sake of seeing a youth who gave such promise of future\r\neminence.[96] One of his earliest masters was the poet Archias, whom he\r\ndefended afterwards in his Consular year; under his instructions he was\r\nable to compose a poem, though yet a boy, on the fable of Glaucus, which\r\nhad formed the subject of one of the tragedies of Æschylus. Soon after\r\nhe assumed the manly gown he was placed under the care of Scævola, the\r\ncelebrated lawyer, whom he introduces so beautifully into several of his\r\nphilosophical dialogues; and in no long time he gained a thorough\r\nknowledge of the laws and political institutions of his country.[97]\r\n\r\nThis was about the time of the Social war; and, according to the Roman\r\ncustom, which made it a necessary part of education to learn the\r\nmilitary art by personal service, Cicero took the opportunity of serving\r\na campaign under the Consul Pompeius Strabo, father of Pompey the Great.\r\nReturning to pursuits more congenial to his natural taste, he commenced\r\nthe study of Philosophy under Philo the Academic, of whom we shall speak\r\nmore particularly hereafter.[98] But his chief attention was reserved\r\nfor Oratory, to which he applied himself with the assistance of Molo,\r\nthe first rhetorician of the day; while Diodotus the Stoic exercised him\r\nin the argumentative subtleties for which the disciples of Zeno were so\r\ngenerally celebrated. At the same time he declaimed daily in Greek and\r\nLatin with some young noblemen, who were competitors with him in the\r\nsame race of political honours.\r\n\r\nOf the two professions,[99] which, from the contentiousness of human\r\nnature, are involved in the very notion of society, while that of arms,\r\nby its splendour and importance, secures the almost undivided admiration\r\nof a rising and uncivilized people, legal practice, on the other hand,\r\nbecomes the path to honours in later and more civilized ages, by reason\r\nof the oratorical accomplishments to which it usually gives scope. The\r\ndate of Cicero's birth fell precisely during that intermediate state of\r\nthings, in which the glory of military exploits lost its pre-eminence\r\nby means of the very opulence and luxury which were their natural issue;\r\nand he was the first Roman who found his way to the highest dignities of\r\nthe State with no other recommendation than his powers of eloquence and\r\nhis merits as a civil magistrate.[100]\r\n\r\nThe first cause of importance he undertook was his defence of Sextus\r\nRoscius; in which he distinguished himself by his spirited opposition to\r\nSylla, whose favourite Chrysogonus was prosecutor in the action. This\r\nobliging him, according to Plutarch, to leave Rome on prudential\r\nmotives, he employed his time in travelling for two years under pretence\r\nof his health, which, he tells us,[101] was as yet unequal to the\r\nexertion of pleading. At Athens he met with T. Pomponius Atticus, whom\r\nhe had formerly known at school, and there renewed with him a friendship\r\nwhich lasted through life, in spite of the change of interests and\r\nestrangements of affection so common in turbulent times.[102] Here too\r\nhe attended the lectures of Antiochus, who, under the name of Academic,\r\ntaught the dogmatic doctrines of Plato and the Stoics. Though Cicero\r\nfelt at first considerable dislike of his philosophical views,[103] he\r\nseems afterwards to have adopted the sentiments of the Old Academy,\r\nwhich they much resembled; and not till late in life to have relapsed\r\ninto the sceptical tenets of his former instructor Philo.[104] After\r\nvisiting the principal philosophers and rhetoricians of Asia, in his\r\nthirtieth year he returned to Rome, so strengthened and improved both\r\nin bodily and mental powers, that he soon eclipsed in his oratorical\r\nefforts all his competitors for public favour. So popular a talent\r\nspeedily gained him the suffrage of the Commons; and, being sent to\r\nSicily as Quæstor, at a time when the metropolis itself was visited with\r\na scarcity of corn, he acquitted himself in that delicate situation with\r\nsuch address as to supply the clamorous wants of the people without\r\noppressing the province from which the provisions were raised.[105]\r\nReturning thence with greater honours than had ever been before decreed\r\nto a Roman Governor, he ingratiated himself still farther in the esteem\r\nof the Sicilians by undertaking his celebrated prosecution of Verres;\r\nwho, though defended by the influence of the Metelli and the eloquence\r\nof Hortensius, was at length driven in despair into voluntary exile.\r\n\r\nFive years after his Quæstorship, Cicero was elected Ædile, a post of\r\nconsiderable expense from the exhibition of games connected with it. In\r\nthis magistracy he conducted himself with singular propriety;[106] for,\r\nit being customary to court the people by a display of splendour in\r\nthese official shows, he contrived to retain his popularity without\r\nsubmitting to the usual alternative of plundering the provinces or\r\nsacrificing his private fortune. The latter was at this time by no means\r\nample; but, with the good sense and taste which mark his character, he\r\npreserved in his domestic arrangements the dignity of a literary and\r\npublic man, without any of the ostentation of magnificence which often\r\ndistinguished the candidate for popular applause.[107]\r\n\r\nAfter the customary interval of two years, he was returned at the head\r\nof the list as Prætor;[108] and now made his first appearance in the\r\nrostrum in support of the Manilian law. About the same time he defended\r\nCluentius. At the expiration of his Prætorship, he refused to accept a\r\nforeign province, the usual reward of that magistracy;[109] but, having\r\nthe Consulate full in view, and relying on his interest with Cæsar and\r\nPompey, he allowed nothing to divert him from that career of glory for\r\nwhich he now believed himself to be destined.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\nIt may be doubted, indeed, whether any individual ever rose to power by\r\nmore virtuous and truly honourable conduct; the integrity of his public\r\nlife was only equalled by the correctness of his private morals; and it\r\nmay at first sight excite our wonder that a course so splendidly begun\r\nshould afterwards so little fulfil its early promise. Yet it was a\r\nfailure from the period of his Consulate to his Pro-prætorship in\r\nCilicia, and each year is found to diminish his influence in public\r\naffairs, till it expires altogether with the death of Pompey. This\r\nsurprise, however, arises in no small degree from measuring Cicero's\r\npolitical importance by his present reputation, and confounding the\r\nauthority he deservedly possesses as an author with the opinions\r\nentertained of him by his contemporaries as a statesman. From the\r\nconsequence usually attached to passing events, a politician's celebrity\r\nis often at its zenith in his own generation; while the author, who is\r\nin the highest repute with posterity, may perhaps have been little\r\nvalued or courted in his own day. Virtue indeed so conspicuous as that\r\nof Cicero, studies so dignified, and oratorical powers so commanding,\r\nwill always invest their possessor with a large portion of reputation\r\nand authority; and this is nowhere more apparent than in the\r\nenthusiastic welcome with which he was greeted on his return from exile.\r\nBut unless other qualities be added, more peculiarly necessary for a\r\nstatesman, they will hardly of themselves carry that political weight\r\nwhich some writers have attached to Cicero's public life, and which his\r\nown self-love led him to appropriate.\r\n\r\nThe advice of the Oracle,[110] which had directed him to make his own\r\ngenius, not the opinion of the people, his guide to immortality (which\r\nin fact pointed at the above-mentioned distinction between the fame of a\r\nstatesman and of an author), at first made a deep impression on his\r\nmind; and at the present day he owes his reputation principally to those\r\npursuits which, as Plutarch tells us, exposed him to the ridicule and\r\neven to the contempt of his contemporaries as a \"pedant and a\r\nprofessor.\"[111] But his love of popularity overcame his philosophy, and\r\nhe commenced a career which gained him one triumph and ten thousand\r\nmortifications.\r\n\r\nIt is not indeed to be doubted that in his political course he was more\r\nor less influenced by a sense of duty. To many it may even appear that a\r\npublic life was best adapted for the display of his particular talents;\r\nthat, at the termination of the Mithridatic war, Cicero was in fact\r\nmarked out as the very man to adjust the pretensions of the rival\r\nparties in the Commonwealth, to withstand the encroachments of Pompey,\r\nand to baffle the arts of Cæsar. And if the power of swaying and\r\ncontrolling the popular assemblies by his eloquence; if the\r\ncircumstances of his rank, Equestrian as far as family was concerned,\r\nyet almost Patrician from the splendour of his personal honours; if the\r\npopularity derived from his accusation of Verres, and defence of\r\nCornelius, and the favour of the Senate acquired by the brilliant\r\nservices of his Consulate; if the general respect of all parties which\r\nhis learning and virtue commanded; if these were sufficient\r\nqualifications for a mediator between contending factions, Cicero was\r\nindeed called upon by the voice of his country to that most arduous and\r\nhonourable post. And in his Consulate he had seemed sensible of the\r\ncall: \"All through my Consulate,\" he declares in his speech against\r\nPiso, \"I made a point of doing nothing without the advice of the Senate\r\nand the approval of the People. I ever defended the Senate in the\r\nRostrum, in the Senate House the People, and united the populace with\r\nthe leading men, the Equestrian order with the Senate.\"\r\n\r\nYet, after that eventful period, we see him resigning his high station\r\nto Cato, who, with half his abilities, little foresight, and no\r\naddress,[112] possessed that first requisite for a statesman, firmness.\r\nCicero, on the contrary, was irresolute, timid, and inconsistent.[113]\r\nHe talked indeed largely of preserving a middle course,[114] but he was\r\ncontinually vacillating from one to the other extreme; always too\r\nconfident or too dejected; incorrigibly vain of success, yet meanly\r\npanegyrizing the government of an usurper. His foresight, sagacity,\r\npractical good sense, and singular tact, were lost for want of that\r\nstrength of mind which points them steadily to one object. He was never\r\ndecided, never (as has sometimes been observed) took an important step\r\nwithout afterwards repenting of it. Nor can we account for the firmness\r\nand resolution of his Consulate, unless we discriminate between the\r\ncase of resisting and exposing a faction, and that of balancing\r\ncontending interests. Vigour in repression differs widely from\r\nsteadiness in mediation; the latter requiring a coolness of judgment,\r\nwhich a direct attack upon a public foe is so far from implying, that it\r\neven inspires minds naturally timid with unusual ardour.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\nHis Consulate was succeeded by the return of Pompey from the East, and\r\nthe establishment of the First Triumvirate; which, disappointing his\r\nhopes of political power, induced him to resume his forensic and\r\nliterary occupations. From these he was recalled, after an interval of\r\nfour years, by the threatening measures of Clodius, who at length\r\nsucceeded in driving him into exile. This event, which, considering the\r\ncircumstances connected with it, was one of the most glorious of his\r\nlife, filled him with the utmost distress and despondency. He wandered\r\nabout Greece bewailing his miserable fortune, refusing the consolations\r\nwhich his friends attempted to administer, and shunning the public\r\nhonours with which the Greek cities were eager to load him.[115] His\r\nreturn, which took place in the course of the following year, reinstated\r\nhim in the high station he had filled at the termination of his\r\nConsulate, but the circumstances of the times did not allow him to\r\nretain it. We refer to Roman history for an account of his vacillations\r\nbetween the several members of the Triumvirate; his defence of Vatinius\r\nto please Cæsar; and of his bitter political enemy Gabinius, to\r\ningratiate himself with Pompey. His personal history in the meanwhile\r\nfurnishes little worth noticing, except his election into the college of\r\nAugurs, a dignity which had been a particular object of his ambition.\r\nHis appointment to the government of Cilicia, which took place about\r\nfive years after his return from exile, was in consequence of Pompey's\r\nlaw, which obliged those Senators of Consular or Prætorian rank, who had\r\nnever held any foreign command, to divide the vacant provinces among\r\nthem. This office, which we have above seen him decline, he now accepted\r\nwith feelings of extreme reluctance, dreading perhaps the military\r\noccupations which the movements of the Parthians in that quarter\r\nrendered necessary. Yet if we consider the state and splendour with\r\nwhich the Proconsuls were surrounded, and the opportunities afforded\r\nthem for almost legalized plunder and extortion, we must confess that\r\nthis insensibility to the common objects of human cupidity was the token\r\nof no ordinary mind. The singular disinterestedness and integrity of his\r\nadministration, as well as his success against the enemy, also belong to\r\nthe history of his times. The latter he exaggerated from the desire, so\r\noften instanced in eminent men, of appearing to excel in those things\r\nfor which nature has not adapted them.\r\n\r\nHis return to Italy was followed by earnest endeavours to reconcile\r\nPompey with Cæsar, and by very spirited behaviour when Cæsar required\r\nhis presence in the Senate. On this occasion he felt the glow of\r\nself-approbation with which his political conduct seldom repaid him: he\r\nwrites to Atticus,[116] \"I believe I do not please Cæsar, but I am\r\npleased with myself, which has not happened to me for a long while.\"\r\nHowever, this effort at independence was but transient. At no period of\r\nhis public life did he display such miserable vacillation as at the\r\nopening of the civil war.[117] We find him first accepting a commission\r\nfrom the Republic; then courting Cæsar; next, on Pompey's sailing for\r\nGreece, resolving to follow him thither; presently determining to stand\r\nneuter; then bent on retiring to the Pompeians in Sicily; and, when\r\nafter all he had joined their camp in Greece, discovering such timidity\r\nand discontent as to draw from Pompey the bitter reproof, \"I wish Cicero\r\nwould go over to the enemy, that he may learn to fear us.\"[118]\r\n\r\nOn his return to Italy, after the battle of Pharsalia, he had the\r\nmortification of learning that his brother and nephew were making their\r\npeace with Cæsar, by throwing on himself the blame of their opposition\r\nto the conqueror. And here we see one of those elevated points of\r\ncharacter which redeem the weaknesses of his political conduct; for,\r\nhearing that Cæsar had retorted on Quintus Cicero the charge which the\r\nlatter had brought against himself, he wrote a pressing letter in his\r\nfavour, declaring his brother's safety was not less precious to him than\r\nhis own, and representing him not as the leader, but as the companion of\r\nhis voyage.[119]\r\n\r\nNow too the state of his private affairs reduced him to much perplexity;\r\na sum he had advanced to Pompey had impoverished him, and he was forced\r\nto stand indebted to Atticus for present assistance.[120] These\r\ndifficulties led him to take a step which it has been customary to\r\nregard with great severity; the divorce of his wife Terentia, though he\r\nwas then in his sixty-second year, and his marriage with his rich ward\r\nPublilia, who of course was of an age disproportionate to his own.[121]\r\nYet, in reviewing this proceeding, we must not adopt the modern standard\r\nof propriety, forgetful of a condition of society which reconciled\r\nactions even of moral turpitude with a reputation for honour and virtue.\r\nTerentia was a woman of a most imperious and violent temper, and (what\r\nis more to the purpose) had in no slight degree contributed to his\r\npresent embarrassments by her extravagance in the management of his\r\nprivate affairs.[122] By her he had two children, a son, born a year\r\nbefore his Consulate, and a daughter whose loss he was now fated to\r\ndeplore. To Tullia he was tenderly attached, not only from the\r\nexcellence of her disposition, but from her literary tastes; and her\r\ndeath tore from him, as he so pathetically laments to Sulpicius, the\r\nonly comfort which the course of public events had left him.[123] At\r\nfirst he was inconsolable; and, retiring to a little island near his\r\nestate at Antium, he buried himself in the woods, to avoid the sight of\r\nman.[124] His distress was increased by the conduct of his new wife\r\nPublilia; whom he soon divorced for testifying joy at the death of her\r\nstepdaughter. On this occasion he wrote his Treatise on Consolation,\r\nwith a view to alleviate his grief; and, with the same object, he\r\ndetermined on dedicating a temple to his daughter, as a memorial of her\r\nvirtues and his affection. His friends were assiduous in their\r\nattentions; and Cæsar, who had treated him with extreme kindness on his\r\nreturn from Egypt, signified the respect he bore his character by\r\nsending him a letter of condolence from Spain,[125] where the remains of\r\nthe Pompeian party still engaged him. Cæsar, moreover, had shortly\r\nbefore given a still stronger proof of his favour, by replying to a work\r\nwhich Cicero had drawn up in praise of Cato;[126] but no attentions,\r\nhowever considerate, could soften Cicero's vexation at seeing the\r\ncountry he had formerly saved by his exertions now subjected to the\r\ntyranny of one master. His speeches, indeed, for Marcellus and Ligarius,\r\nexhibit traces of inconsistency; but for the most part he retired from\r\npublic business, and gave himself up to the composition of those works\r\nwhich, while they mitigated his political sorrows, have secured his\r\nliterary celebrity.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\nThe murder of Cæsar, which took place in the following year, once more\r\nbrought him on the stage of public affairs; but as our present paper is\r\nbut supplemental to the history of the times, we leave to others to\r\nrelate what more has to be told of him, his unworthy treatment of\r\nBrutus, his coalition with Octavius, his orations against Antonius, his\r\nproscription, and his violent death, at the age of sixty-four. Willingly\r\nwould we pass over his public life altogether; for he was as little of a\r\ngreat statesman as of a great commander. His merits are of another kind\r\nand in a higher order of excellence. Antiquity may be challenged to\r\nproduce a man more virtuous, more perfectly amiable than Cicero. None\r\ninterest more in their life, none excite more painful emotions in their\r\ndeath. Others, it is true, may be found of loftier and more heroic\r\ncharacter, who awe and subdue the mind by the grandeur of their views,\r\nor the intensity of their exertions. But Cicero engages our affections\r\nby the integrity of his public conduct, the correctness of his private\r\nlife, the generosity,[127] placability, and kindness of his heart, the\r\nplayfulness of his wit, the warmth of his domestic attachments. In this\r\nrespect his letters are invaluable. \"Here,\" says Middleton, \"we may see\r\nthe genuine man without disguise or affectation, especially in his\r\nletters to Atticus; to whom he talked with the same frankness as to\r\nhimself, opened the rise and progress of each thought; and never entered\r\ninto any affair without his particular advice.\"[128]\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed, indeed, that this private correspondence discloses\r\nthe defects of his political conduct, and shows that they were partly of\r\na moral character. Want of firmness has been repeatedly mentioned as his\r\nprincipal failing; and insincerity is the natural attendant on a timid\r\nand irresolute mind. On the other hand, it must not be forgotten that\r\nopenness and candour are rare qualities in a statesman at all times, and\r\nwhile the duplicity of weakness is despised, the insincerity of a\r\npowerful but crafty mind, though incomparably more odious, is too\r\ncommonly regarded with feelings of indulgence. Cicero was deficient, not\r\nin honesty, but in moral courage; his disposition, too, was conciliatory\r\nand forgiving; and much which has been referred to inconsistency should\r\nbe attributed to the generous temper which induced him to remember the\r\nservices rather than the neglect of Plancius, and to relieve the exiled\r\nand indigent Verres.[129] Much too may be traced to his professional\r\nhabits as a pleader; which led him to introduce the licence of the\r\nForum into deliberative discussions, and (however inexcusably) even into\r\nhis correspondence with private friends.\r\n\r\nSome writers, as Lyttelton, have considered it an aggravation of\r\nCicero's inconsistencies, that he was so perfectly aware, as his\r\nwritings show, of what was philosophically and morally upright and\r\nhonest. It might be sufficient to reply, that there is a wide difference\r\nbetween calmly deciding on an abstract point, and acting on that\r\ndecision in the hurry of real life; that Cicero in fact was apt to fancy\r\n(as all will fancy when assailed by interest or passion) that the\r\ncircumstances of his case constituted it an exception to the broad\r\nprinciples of duty. Besides, he considered it to be actually the duty of\r\na statesman to accommodate theoretical principle to the exigencies of\r\nexisting circumstances. \"Surely,\" he says in his defence of Plancius,\r\n\"it is no mark of inconsistency in a statesman to determine his judgment\r\nand to steer his course by the state of the political weather. This is\r\nwhat I have been taught, what I have experienced, what I have read; this\r\nis what is recorded in history of the wisest and most eminent men,\r\nwhether at home or abroad; namely, that the same man is not bound always\r\nto maintain the same opinions, but those, whatever they may be, which\r\nthe state of the commonwealth, the direction of the times, and the\r\ninterests of peace may demand.\"[130] Moreover, he claimed for himself\r\nespecially the part of mediator between political rivals; and he\r\nconsidered it to be a mediator's duty alternately to praise and blame\r\nboth parties, even to exaggeration, if by such means it was possible\r\neither to flatter or frighten them into an adoption of temperate\r\nmeasures.[131] \"Cicero,\" says Plutarch, \"used to give them private\r\nadvice, keeping up a correspondence with Cæsar, and urging many things\r\nupon Pompey himself, soothing and persuading each of them.\"[132]\r\n\r\n\r\n5.\r\n\r\nBut such criticism on Cicero as Lyttelton's proceeds on an entire\r\nmisconception of the design and purpose with which the ancients\r\nprosecuted philosophical studies. The motives and principles of morals\r\nwere not so seriously acknowledged as to lead to a practical application\r\nof them to the conduct of life. Even when they proposed them in the form\r\nof precept, they still regarded the perfectly virtuous man as the\r\ncreature of their imagination rather than a model for imitation--a\r\ncharacter whom it was a mental recreation rather than a duty to\r\ncontemplate; and if an individual here or there, as Scipio or Cato,\r\nattempted to conform his life to his philosophical conceptions of\r\nvirtue, he was sure to be ridiculed for singularity and affectation.\r\n\r\nEven among the Athenians, by whom philosophy was, in many cases,\r\ncultivated to the exclusion of every active profession, intellectual\r\namusement, not the discovery of Truth, was the principal object of their\r\ndiscussions. That we must thus account for the ensnaring questions and\r\nsophistical reasonings of which their disputations consisted, has been\r\nnoticed by writers on Logic;[133] and it was their extension of this\r\nsystem to the case of morals which brought upon their Sophists the irony\r\nof Socrates and the sterner rebuke of Aristotle. But if this took place\r\nin a state of society in which the love of speculation pervaded all\r\nranks, much more was it to be expected among the Romans, who, busied as\r\nthey were in political enterprises, and deficient in philosophical\r\nacuteness, had neither time nor inclination for abstruse investigations;\r\nand who considered philosophy simply as one of the many fashions\r\nintroduced from Greece, \"a sort of table furniture,\" as Warburton well\r\nexpresses it, a mere refinement in the arts of social enjoyment.[134]\r\nThis character it bore both among friends and enemies. Hence the\r\npopularity which attended the three Athenian philosophers who had come\r\nto Rome on an embassy from their native city; and hence the inflexible\r\ndetermination with which Cato procured their dismissal, through fear, as\r\nPlutarch tells us,[135] lest their arts of disputation should corrupt\r\nthe Roman youth. And when at length, by the authority of Scipio,[136]\r\nthe literary treasures of Sylla, and the patronage of Lucullus,\r\nphilosophical studies had gradually received the countenance of the\r\nhigher classes of their countrymen, still, in consistency with the\r\nprinciple above laid down, we find them determined in their adoption of\r\nthis or that system, not so much by the harmony of its parts, or by the\r\nplausibility of its reasonings, as by its suitableness to the particular\r\nprofession and political station to which they severally belonged. Thus,\r\nbecause the Stoics were more minute than other sects in inculcating the\r\nmoral and social duties, we find the Roman jurisconsults professing\r\nthemselves followers of Zeno;[137] the orators, on the contrary, adopted\r\nthe disputatious system of the later Academics;[138] while Epicurus was\r\nthe master of the idle and the wealthy. Hence, too, they confined the\r\nprofession of philosophical science to Greek teachers; considering them\r\nthe sole proprietors, as it were, of a foreign and expensive luxury,\r\nwhich the vanquished might suitably have the duty of furnishing, and\r\nwhich the conquerors could well afford to purchase.\r\n\r\nBefore the works of Cicero, no attempts worth considering had been made\r\nfor using the Latin tongue in philosophical subjects. The natural\r\nstubbornness of the language conspired with Roman haughtiness to prevent\r\nthis application.[139] The Epicureans, indeed, had made the experiment,\r\nbut their writings were even affectedly harsh and slovenly,[140] and we\r\nfind Cicero himself, in spite of his inexhaustible flow of rich and\r\nexpressive diction, making continual apologies for his learned\r\noccupations, and extolling philosophy as the parent of everything great,\r\nvirtuous, and amiable.[141]\r\n\r\nYet, with whatever discouragement his design was attended, he ultimately\r\ntriumphed over the pride of an unlettered people, and the difficulties\r\nof a defective language. He was indeed possessed of that first requisite\r\nfor eminence, an enthusiastic attachment to the studies he was\r\nrecommending. But, occupied as he was with the duties of a statesman,\r\nmere love of literature would have availed little, if separated from\r\nthat energy and breadth of intellect by which he was enabled to pursue a\r\nvariety of objects at once, with equally perserving and indefatigable\r\nzeal. \"He suffered no part of his leisure to be idle,\" says Middleton,\r\n\"or the least interval of it to be lost; but what other people gave to\r\nthe public shows, to pleasures, to feasts, nay, even to sleep and the\r\nordinary refreshments of nature, he generally gave to his books, and the\r\nenlargement of his knowledge. On days of business, when he had anything\r\nparticular to compose, he had no other time for meditating but when he\r\nwas taking a few turns in his walks, where he used to dictate his\r\nthoughts to his scribes who attended him. We find many of his letters\r\ndated before daylight, some from the senate, others from his meals, and\r\nthe crowd of his morning levee.\"[142] Thus he found time, without\r\napparent inconvenience, for the business of the State, for the turmoil\r\nof the courts, and for philosophical studies. During his Consulate he\r\ndelivered twelve orations in the Senate, Rostrum, or Forum. His\r\nTreatises _de Oratore_ and _de Republicâ_, the most finished perhaps of\r\nhis compositions, were written at a time when, to use his own words,\r\n\"not a day passed without his taking part in forensic disputes.\"[143]\r\nAnd in the last year of his life he composed at least eight of his\r\nphilosophical works, besides the fourteen orations against Antony, which\r\nare known by the name of Philippics.\r\n\r\nBeing thus ardent in the cause of philosophy, he recommended it to the\r\nnotice of his countrymen, not only for the honour which its introduction\r\nwould reflect upon himself (which of course was a motive with him), but\r\nalso with the fondness of one who esteemed it \"the guide of life, the\r\nparent of virtue, the guardian in difficulty, and the tranquillizer in\r\nmisfortune.\"[144] Nor were his mental endowments less adapted to the\r\naccomplishment of his object than the spirit with which he engaged in\r\nthe work. Gifted with great versatility of talent, with acuteness,\r\nquickness of perception, skill in selection, art in arrangement,\r\nfertility of illustration, warmth of fancy, and extraordinary taste, he\r\nat once seizes upon the most effective parts of his subject, places them\r\nin the most striking point of view, and arrays them in the liveliest and\r\nmost inviting colours. His writings have the singular felicity of\r\ncombining brilliancy of execution with never-failing good sense. It must\r\nbe allowed that he is deficient in depth; that he skims over rather than\r\ndives into the subjects of which he treats; that he had too great\r\ncommand of the plausible to be a patient investigator or a sound\r\nreasoner. Yet if he has less originality of thought than others, if he\r\ndoes not grapple with his subject, if he is unequal to a regular and\r\nlengthened disquisition, if he is frequently inconsistent in his\r\nopinions, we must remember that mere soundness of view, without talent\r\nfor display, has few recommendations for those who have not yet imbibed\r\na taste even for the outward form of knowledge,[145] that system nearly\r\nprecludes freedom, and depth almost implies obscurity. It was this very\r\nabsence of scientific exactness which constituted in Roman eyes a\r\nprincipal charm of Cicero's compositions.[146]\r\n\r\nNor must his profession as a pleader be forgotten in enumerating the\r\ncircumstances which concurred to give his writings their peculiar\r\ncharacter. For, however his design of interesting his countrymen in\r\nGreek literature, however too his particular line of talent, may have\r\nled him to explain rather than to invent; yet he expressly informs us it\r\nwas principally with a view to his own improvement in Oratory that he\r\ndevoted himself to philosophical studies.[147] This induced him to\r\nundertake successively the cause of the Stoic, the Epicurean, or the\r\nPlatonist, as an exercise for his powers of argumentation; while the\r\nwavering and unsettled state of mind, occasioned by such habits of\r\ndisputation, led him in his personal judgment to prefer the sceptical\r\ntenets of the New Academy.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.\r\n\r\nHere then, before enumerating Cicero's philosophical writings, an\r\nopportunity is presented to us of redeeming the pledge we have given\r\nelsewhere in our Encyclopædia,[148] to consider the system of doctrine\r\nwhich the reformers (as they thought themselves) of the Academic school\r\nintroduced about 300 years before the Christian era.\r\n\r\nWe shall not trace here the history of the Old Academy, or speak of the\r\ninnovations on the system of Plato, silently introduced by the austere\r\nPolemo. When Zeno, however, who was his pupil, advocated the same rigid\r\ntenets in a more open and dogmatic form,[149] the Academy at length took\r\nthe alarm, and a reaction ensued. Arcesilas, who had succeeded Polemo\r\nand Crates, determined on reverting to the principles of the elder\r\nschools;[150] but mistaking the profession of ignorance, which Socrates\r\nhad used against the Sophists on physical questions, for an actual\r\nscepticism on points connected with morals, he fell into the opposite\r\nextreme, and declared, first, that nothing could be known, and\r\ntherefore, secondly, nothing should be maintained.[151]\r\n\r\nWhatever were his private sentiments (for some authors affirm his\r\nesoteric doctrines to have been dogmatic[152]), he brought forward these\r\nsceptical tenets in so unguarded a form, that it required all his\r\nargumentative powers, which were confessedly great, to maintain them\r\nagainst the obvious objections which were pressed upon him from all\r\nquarters. On his death, therefore, as might have been anticipated, his\r\nschool was deserted for those of Zeno and Epicurus; and during the lives\r\nof Lacydes, Evander, and Hegesinus, who successively filled the Academic\r\nchair, being no longer recommended by the novelty of its doctrines,[153]\r\nor the talents of its masters, it became of little consideration amid\r\nthe wranglings of more popular philosophies. Carneades,[154] therefore,\r\nwho succeeded Hegesinus, found it necessary to use more cautious and\r\nguarded language; and, by explaining what was paradoxical, by\r\nreservations and exceptions, in short, by all the arts which an acute\r\nand active genius could suggest, he contrived to establish its\r\nauthority, without departing, as far as we have the means of judging,\r\nfrom the principle of universal scepticism which Arcesilas had so\r\npertinaciously advocated.[155]\r\n\r\nThe New Academy,[156] then, taught with Plato, that all things in their\r\nown nature were fixed and determinate; but that, through the\r\nconstitution of the human mind, it was impossible _for us_ to see them\r\nin their simple and eternal forms, to separate appearance from reality,\r\ntruth from falsehood.[157] For the conception we form of any object is\r\naltogether derived from and depends on the sensation, the impression, it\r\nproduces on our own minds ([Greek: pathos energeias, phantasia]). Reason\r\ndoes but deduce from premisses ultimately supplied by sensation. Our\r\nonly communication, then, with actual existences being through the\r\nmedium of our own impressions, we have no means of ascertaining the\r\ncorrespondence of the things themselves with the ideas we entertain of\r\nthem; and therefore can in no case be certain of the truthfulness of our\r\nsenses. Of their fallibility, however, we may easily assure ourselves;\r\nfor in cases in which they are detected contradicting each other, all\r\ncannot be correct reporters of the object with which they profess to\r\nacquaint us. Food, which is the same as far as _sight_ and _touch_ are\r\nconcerned, _tastes_ differently to different individuals; fire, which is\r\nthe same to the _eye_, communicates a sensation of _pain_ at one time,\r\nof _pleasure_ at another; the oar _appears_ crooked in the water, while\r\nthe _touch_ assures us it is as straight as before it was immersed.[158]\r\nAgain, in dreams, in intoxication, in madness, impressions are made upon\r\nthe mind, vivid enough to incite to reflection and action, yet utterly\r\nat variance with those produced by the same objects when we are awake,\r\nor sober, or in possession of our reason.[159]\r\n\r\nIt appears, then, that we cannot prove that our senses are _ever_\r\nfaithful to the things they profess to report about; but we do know they\r\n_often_ produce erroneous impressions of them. Here then is room for\r\nendless doubt; for why may they not deceive us in cases in which we\r\ncannot detect the deception? It is certain they _often_ act irregularly;\r\nis there any consistency _at all_ in their operations, any law to which\r\nthese varieties may be referred?\r\n\r\nIt is undeniable that an object often varies in the impression which it\r\nmakes upon the mind, while, on the other hand, the same impression may\r\narise from different objects. What limit is to be assigned to this\r\ndisorder? is there any sensation strong enough to _assure_ us of the\r\npresence of the object which it seems to intimate, any such as to\r\npreclude the possibility of deception? If, when we look into a mirror,\r\nour minds are impressed with the appearance of trees, fields, and\r\nhouses, which are unreal, how can we ascertain beyond all doubt whether\r\nthe scene we directly look upon has any more substantial existence than\r\nthe former?[160]\r\n\r\nFrom these reasonings the Academics taught that nothing was certain,\r\nnothing was to be known ([Greek: katalêpton]). For the Stoics\r\nthemselves, their most determined opponents, defined the [Greek:\r\nkatalêptikê phantasia] (the phantasy or impression which involved\r\nknowledge[160a]) to be one that was capable of being produced by no object\r\nexcept that to which it really belonged.[161]\r\n\r\nSince then we cannot arrive at knowledge, we must suspend our decision,\r\npronounce absolutely on nothing, nay, according to Arcesilas, never even\r\nform an opinion.[162] In the conduct of life, however, probability[163]\r\nmust determine our choice of action; and this admits of different\r\ndegrees. The lowest kind is that which suggests itself on the first view\r\nof the case ([Greek: phantasia pithanê], or _persuasive phantasy_); but\r\nin all important matters we must correct the evidence of our senses by\r\nconsiderations derived from the nature of the medium, the distance of\r\nthe object, the disposition of the organ, the time, the manner, and\r\nother attendant circumstances. When the impression has been thus\r\nminutely considered, the _phantasy_ becomes [Greek: aperiôdeumenê], or\r\n_approved on circumspection_; and if during this examination no\r\nobjection has arisen to weaken our belief, the highest degree of\r\nprobability is attained, and the phantasy is pronounced _unembarrassed\r\nwith doubt_, or [Greek: aperispastos].[164]\r\n\r\nSextus Empiricus illustrates this as follows:[165] If on entering a dark\r\nroom we discern a coiled rope, our first impression may be that it is a\r\nserpent--this is the _persuasive phantasy_. On a closer inspection,\r\nhowever, after _walking round it_ ([Greek: periodeusantes]), or _on\r\ncircumspection_, we observe it does not move, nor has it the proper\r\ncolour, shape, or proportions; and now we conclude it is not a serpent;\r\nhere we are determined in our belief by the [Greek: periôdeumenê\r\nphantasia], and we assent to the _circumspective phantasy_. For an\r\ninstance of the third and most accurate kind, viz., that with which no\r\ncontrary impression interferes, we may refer to the conduct of Admetus\r\non the return of Alcestis from the infernal regions. He believes he sees\r\nhis wife; everything confirms it; but he cannot simply acquiesce in that\r\nopinion, because his mind is _embarrassed or distracted_ [Greek:\r\nperispatai] from the knowledge he has of her having died; he asks,\r\n\"What! do I see my wife I just now buried?\" (_Alc._ 1148.) Hercules\r\nresolves his difficulty, and his phantasy is in repose, or [Greek:\r\naperispastos].\r\n\r\nThe suspension then of assent ([Greek: epochê]) which the Academics\r\nenjoined, was, at least from the time of Carneades,[166] almost a\r\nspeculative doctrine;[167] and herein lay the chief difference between\r\nthem and the Pyrrhonists; that the latter altogether denied the\r\nexistence of the probable, while the former admitted there was\r\nsufficient to allow of action, provided we pronounced absolutely on\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nLittle more can be said concerning the opinions of a sect whose\r\nfundamental maxim was that nothing could be known, and nothing should be\r\ntaught. It lay midway between the other philosophies; and in the\r\naltercations of the various schools it was at once attacked by all,[168]\r\nyet appealed to by each of the contending parties, if not to\r\ncountenance its own sentiments, at least to condemn those advocated by\r\nits opponents,[169] and thus to perform the office of an umpire.[170]\r\nFrom this necessity, then, of being prepared on all sides for\r\nattack,[171] it became as much a school of rhetoric as of\r\nphilosophy,[172] and was celebrated among the ancients for the eloquence\r\nof its masters.[173] Hence also its reputation was continually varying:\r\nfor, requiring the aid of great abilities to maintain its exalted and\r\narduous post, it alternately rose and fell in estimation, according to\r\nthe talents of the individual who happened to fill the chair.[174] And\r\nhence the frequent alterations which took place in its philosophical\r\ntenets; which, depending rather on the arbitrary determinations of its\r\npresent head, than on the tradition of settled maxims, were accommodated\r\nto the views of each successive master, according as he hoped by\r\nsophistry or concession to overcome the repugnance which the mind ever\r\nwill feel to the doctrines of universal scepticism.\r\n\r\nAnd in these continual changes it is pleasing to observe that the\r\ninterests of virtue and good order were uniformly promoted; interests\r\nto which the Academic doctrines were certainly hostile, if not\r\nnecessarily fatal. Thus, although we find Carneades, in conformity to\r\nthe plan adopted by Arcesilas,[175] opposing the _dogmatic_ principles\r\nof the Stoics concerning moral duty,[176] and studiously concealing his\r\nprivate views even from his friends;[177] yet, by allowing that the\r\nsuspense of judgment was not always a duty, that the wise man might\r\nsometimes _believe_ though he could not _know_;[178] he in some measure\r\nrestored the authority of those great instincts of our nature which his\r\npredecessor appears to have discarded. Clitomachus pursued his steps by\r\ninnovations in the same direction;[179] Philo, who followed next,\r\nattempting to reconcile his tenets with those of the Platonic\r\nschool,[180] has been accounted the founder of a fourth academy--while,\r\nto his successor Antiochus, who embraced the doctrines of the\r\nPorch,[181] and maintained the fidelity of the senses, it has been usual\r\nto assign the establishment of a fifth.\r\n\r\n\r\n7.\r\n\r\nWe have already observed that Cicero in early life inclined to the\r\ndoctrines of Plato and Antiochus, which, at the time he composed the\r\nbulk of his writings, he had abandoned for those of Carneades and\r\nPhilo.[182] Yet he was never so entirely a disciple of the New Academy\r\nas to neglect the claims of morality and the laws. He is loud in his\r\nprotestations that truth is the great object of his search: \"For my own\r\npart, if I have applied myself especially to this philosophy, through\r\nany love of display or pleasure in disputation, I should condemn not\r\nonly my folly, but my moral condition. And, therefore, unless it were\r\nabsurd, in an argument like this, to do what is sometimes done in\r\npolitical discussions, I would swear by Jupiter and the divine Penates\r\nthat I burn with a desire of discovering the truth, and really believe\r\nwhat I am saying.\"[183] And, however inappropriate this boast may\r\nappear, he at least pursues the useful and the magnificent in\r\nphilosophy; and uses his academic character as a pretext rather for a\r\njudicious selection from each system than for an indiscriminate\r\nrejection of all.[184] Thus, in the capacity of a statesman, he calls in\r\nthe assistance of doctrines which, as an orator, he does not scruple to\r\nderide; those of Zeno in particular, who maintained the truth of the\r\npopular theology, and the divine origin of augury, and (as we noticed\r\nabove) was more explicit than the other masters in his views of social\r\nduty. This difference of sentiment between the magistrate and the\r\npleader is strikingly illustrated in the opening of his treatise _de\r\nLegibus_; where, after deriving the principles of law from the nature of\r\nthings, he is obliged to beg quarter of the Academics, whose reasonings\r\nhe feels could at once destroy the foundation on which his argument\r\nrested. \"My treatise throughout,\" he says, \"aims at the strengthening of\r\nstates and the welfare of peoples. I dread therefore to lay down any but\r\nwell considered and carefully examined principles; I do not say\r\nprinciples which are universally received, for none are such, but\r\nprinciples received by those philosophers who consider virtue to be\r\ndesirable for its own sake, and nothing whatever to be good, or at least\r\na great good, which is not in its own nature praiseworthy.\" These\r\nphilosophers are the Stoics; and then, apparently alluding to the\r\narguments of Carneades against justice, which he had put into the mouth\r\nof Philus in the third book of his _de Republicâ_, he proceeds: \"As to\r\nthe Academy, which puts the whole subject into utter confusion, I mean\r\nthe New Academy of Arcesilas and Carneades, let us persuade it to hold\r\nits peace. For, should it make an inroad upon the views which we\r\nconsider we have so skilfully put into shape, it will make an extreme\r\nhavoc of them. The Academy I cannot conciliate, and I dare not\r\nignore.\"[185]\r\n\r\nAnd as, in questions connected with the interests of society, he thus\r\nuniformly advocates the tenets of the Porch, so in discussions of a\r\nphysical character we find him adopting the sublime and glowing\r\nsentiments of Pythagoras and Plato. Here, however, having no object of\r\nexpediency in view to keep him within the bounds of consistency, he\r\nscruples not to introduce whatever is most beautiful in itself, or most\r\nadapted to his present purpose. At one time he describes the Deity as\r\nthe all-pervading Soul of the world, the cause of life and motion;[186]\r\nat another He is the intelligent Preserver and Governor of every\r\nseparate part.[187] At one time the soul of man is in its own nature\r\nnecessarily eternal, without beginning or end of existence;[188] at\r\nanother it is represented as a portion, or the haunt of the one\r\ninfinite Spirit;[189] at another it is to enter the assembly of the\r\nGods, or to be driven into darkness, according to its moral conduct in\r\nthis life;[190] at another, it is only in its best and greatest\r\nspecimens destined for immortality;[191] sometimes that immortality is\r\ndescribed as attended with consciousness and the continuance of earthly\r\nfriendships;[192] sometimes as but an immortality of name and\r\nglory;[193] more frequently however these separate notions are confused\r\ntogether in the same passage.\r\n\r\nThough the works of Aristotle were not given to the world till Sylla's\r\nreturn from Greece, Cicero appears to have been a considerable\r\nproficient in his philosophy,[194] and he has not overlooked the\r\nimportant aid it affords in those departments of science which are alike\r\nremoved from abstract reasoning and fanciful theorizing. To Aristotle he\r\nis indebted for most of the principles laid down in his rhetorical\r\ndiscussions,[195] while in his treatises on morals not a few of his\r\nremarks may be traced to the same acute philosopher.[196]\r\n\r\nThe doctrines of the Garden alone, though some of his most intimate\r\nfriends were of the Epicurean school, he regarded with aversion and\r\ncontempt; feeling no sort of interest in a system which cut at the very\r\nroot of that activity of mind, industry, and patriotism, for which he\r\nhimself both in public and private was so honourably distinguished.[197]\r\n\r\nSuch then was the New Academy, and such the variation of opinion which,\r\nin Cicero's judgment, was not inconsistent with the profession of an\r\nAcademic. And, however his adoption of that philosophy may be in part\r\nreferred to his oratorical habits, or his natural cast of mind, yet,\r\nconsidering the ambition which he felt to inspire his countrymen with a\r\ntaste for literature and science,[198] we must conclude with\r\nWarburton[199] that, in acceding to the system of Philo, he was strongly\r\ninfluenced by the freedom of thought and reasoning which it allowed to\r\nhis literary works, the liberty of illustrating the principles and\r\ndoctrines, the strong and weak parts, of every Grecian school. Bearing\r\nthen in mind his design of recommending the study of philosophy, it is\r\ninteresting to observe the artifices of style and manner which, with\r\nthis end, he adopted in his treatises; and though to enter minutely into\r\nthis subject would be foreign to our present purpose, it may be allowed\r\nus to make some general remarks on the character of works so eminently\r\nsuccessful in accomplishing the object for which they were undertaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n8.\r\n\r\nThe obvious peculiarity of Cicero's philosophical discussions is the\r\nform of dialogue in which most of them are conveyed. Plato, indeed, and\r\nXenophon, had, before his time, been even more strictly dramatic in\r\ntheir compositions; but they professed to be recording the sentiments\r\nof an individual, and the Socratic mode of argument could hardly be\r\ndisplayed in any other shape. Of that interrogative and inductive\r\nconversation, however, Cicero affords but few specimens;[200] the nature\r\nof his dialogue being as different from that of the two Athenians as was\r\nhis object in writing. His aim was to excite interest; and he availed\r\nhimself of this mode of composition for the life and variety, the ease,\r\nperspicuity, and vigour which it gave to his discussions. His dialogue\r\nis of two kinds: according as the subject of it is beyond or under\r\ncontroversy, it assumes the shape of a continued treatise, or a free\r\ndisputation; in the latter case imparting clearness to what is obscure,\r\nin the former relief to what is clear. Thus his practical and systematic\r\ntreatises on rhetoric and moral duty, when not written in his own\r\nperson, are merely divided between several speakers who are the mere\r\norgans of his own sentiments; while in questions of a more speculative\r\ncast, on the nature of the gods, on the human soul, on the greatest\r\ngood, he uses his academic liberty, and brings forward the theories of\r\ncontending schools under the character of their respective advocates.\r\nThe advantages gained in both cases by the form of dialogue are evident.\r\nIn controverted subjects he is not obliged to discover his own views, he\r\ncan detail opposite arguments forcibly and luminously, and he is allowed\r\nthe use of those oratorical powers in which, after all, his great\r\nstrength lay. In those subjects, on the other hand, which are\r\nuninteresting because they are familiar, he may pause or digress before\r\nthe mind is weary and the attention begins to flag; the reader is\r\ncarried on by easy journeys and short stages, and novelty in the speaker\r\nsupplies the want of novelty in the matter. Nor does Cicero discover\r\nless skill in the execution of these dialogues than address in their\r\nmethod. It were idle to enlarge upon the beauty, richness, and taste of\r\ncompositions which have been the admiration of every age and country. In\r\nthe dignity of his speakers, their high tone of mutual courtesy, the\r\nharmony of his groups, and the delicate relief of his contrasts, he is\r\ninimitable. The majesty and splendour of his introductions, which\r\ngenerally address themselves to the passions or the imagination, the\r\neloquence with which both sides of a question are successively\r\ndisplayed, the clearness and terseness of his statements on abstract\r\npoints, the grace of his illustrations, his exquisite allusions to the\r\nscene or time of the supposed conversation, his digressions in praise of\r\nphilosophy or great men, his quotations from Grecian and Roman poetry;\r\nlastly, the melody and fulness of his style, unite to throw a charm\r\nround his writings peculiar to themselves. To the Roman reader they\r\nespecially recommended themselves by their continual and most artful\r\nreferences to the heroes of the old republic, who now appeared but\r\nexemplars, and (as it were) patrons of that eternal philosophy, which he\r\nhad before, perhaps, considered as the short-lived reveries of ingenious\r\nbut inactive men. Nor is there any confusion, want of keeping, or\r\nappearance of effort in the introduction of the various beauties we have\r\nbeen enumerating, which are blended together with so much skill and\r\npropriety, that it is sometimes difficult to point out the particular\r\nsources of the admiration which they inspire.\r\n\r\n\r\n9.\r\n\r\nThe series of his rhetorical works[201] has been preserved nearly\r\ncomplete, and consists of the _De Inventione_, _De Oratore_, _Brutus\r\nsive de claris Oratoribus_, _Orator sive de optimo genere Dicendi_, _De\r\npartitione Oratoriâ_, _Topica_, and _de optimo genere Oratorum_. The\r\nlast-mentioned, which is a fragment, is understood to have been the\r\nproem to his translation (now lost) of the speeches of Demosthenes and\r\nÆschines, _De Coronâ_. These he translated with the view of defending,\r\nby the example of the Greek orators, his own style of eloquence, which,\r\nas we shall afterwards find, the critics of the day censured as too\r\nAsiatic in its character; and hence the proem, which still survives, is\r\non the subject of the Attic style of oratory. This composition and his\r\nabstracts of his own orations[202] are his only rhetorical works not\r\nextant, and probably our loss is not very great. The _Treatise on\r\nRhetoric_, addressed to Herennius, though edited with his works, and\r\nascribed to him by several of the ancients, is now generally attributed\r\nto Cornificius, or some other writer of the day.\r\n\r\nThe works, which we have enumerated, consider the art of rhetoric in\r\ndifferent points of view, and thus receive from each other mutual\r\nsupport and illustration, while they prevent the tediousness which might\r\nelse arise, if they were moulded into one systematic treatise on the\r\ngeneral subject. Three are in the form of dialogue; the rest are written\r\nin his own person. In all, except perhaps the _Orator_, he professes to\r\nhave availed himself of the principles of the Aristotelic and Isocratean\r\nschools, selecting what was best in each of them, and, as occasion might\r\noffer, adding remarks and precepts of his own.[203] The subject of\r\nOratory is considered in three distinct lights;[204] with reference to\r\nthe case, the speaker, and the speech. The case, as respects its\r\nnature, is definite or indefinite; with reference to the hearer, it is\r\njudicial, deliberative, or descriptive; as regards the opponent, the\r\ndivision is fourfold--according as the fact, its nature, its quality, or\r\nits propriety is called in question. The art of the speaker is directed\r\nto five points: the discovery of persuasives (whether ethical,\r\npathetical, or argumentative), arrangement, diction, memory, delivery.\r\nAnd the speech itself consists of six parts: introduction, statement of\r\nthe case, division of the subject, proof, refutation, and conclusion.\r\n\r\nHis treatises _De Inventione_ and _Topica_, the first and nearly the\r\nlast of his compositions, are both on the invention of arguments, which\r\nhe regards, with Aristotle, as the very foundation of the art; though he\r\nelsewhere confines the term eloquence, according to its derivation, to\r\ndenote excellence of diction and delivery, to the exclusion of\r\nargumentative skill.[205] The former of these works was written at the\r\nage of twenty, and seems originally to have consisted of four books, of\r\nwhich but two remain.[206] In the first of these he considers rhetorical\r\ninvention generally, supplies commonplaces for the six parts of an\r\noration promiscuously, and gives a full analysis of the two forms of\r\nargument, syllogism and induction. In the second book he applies these\r\nrules particularly to the three subject-matters of rhetoric, the\r\ndeliberative, the judicial, and the descriptive, dwelling principally on\r\nthe judicial, as affording the most ample field for discussion. This\r\ntreatise seems for the most part compiled from the writings of\r\nAristotle, Isocrates, and Hermagoras;[207] and as such he alludes to it\r\nin the opening of his _De Oratore_ as deficient in the experience and\r\njudgment which nothing but time and practice can impart. Still it is an\r\nentertaining, nay, useful work; remarkable, even among Cicero's\r\nwritings, for its uniform good sense, and less familiar to the scholar\r\nonly because the greater part has been superseded by the compositions of\r\nhis riper years.\r\n\r\nHis _Topica_, or treatise on commonplaces, has less extent and variety\r\nof plan, being little else than a compendium of Aristotle's work on the\r\nsame subject. It was, as he informs us in its proem, drawn up from\r\nmemory on his voyage from Italy to Greece, soon after Cæsar's murder,\r\nand in compliance with the wishes of Trebatius, who had some time before\r\nurged him to undertake the translation.[208]\r\n\r\nCicero seems to have intended his _De Oratore_, _De claris Oratoribus_,\r\nand _Orator_, to form one complete system.[209] Of these three noble\r\nworks the first lays down the principles and rules of the rhetorical\r\nart; the second exemplifies them in the most eminent speakers of Greece\r\nand Rome; and the third shadows out the features of that perfect orator,\r\nwhose superhuman excellences should be the aim of our ambition. The _De\r\nOratore_ was written when the author was fifty-two, two years after his\r\nreturn from exile; and is a dialogue between some of the most\r\nillustrious Romans of the preceding age on the subject of oratory. The\r\nprincipal speakers are the orators Crassus and Antonius, who are\r\nrepresented unfolding the principles of their art to Sulpicius and\r\nCotta, young men just rising in the legal profession. In the first book,\r\nthe conversation turns on the subject-matter of rhetoric, and the\r\nqualifications requisite for the perfect orator. Here Crassus maintains\r\nthe necessity of his being acquainted with the whole circle of the arts,\r\nwhile Antonius confines eloquence to the province of speaking well. The\r\ndispute for the most part seems verbal; for Cicero himself, though he\r\nhere sides with Crassus, yet elsewhere, as we have above noticed,\r\npronounces eloquence, strictly speaking, to consist in beauty of\r\ndiction. Scævola, the celebrated lawyer, takes part in this preliminary\r\ndiscussion; but, in the ensuing meetings, makes way for Catulus and\r\nCæsar, the subject leading to such technical disquisitions as were\r\nhardly suitable to the dignity of the aged Augur.[210] The next morning\r\nAntonius enters upon the subject of invention, which Cæsar completes by\r\nsubjoining some remarks on the use of humour in oratory; and Antonius,\r\nrelieving him, finishes the morning discussion with treating of\r\narrangement and memory. In the afternoon the rules for propriety and\r\nelegance of diction are explained by Crassus, who was celebrated in this\r\ndepartment of the art; and the work concludes with his handling the\r\nsubject of delivery and action. Such is the plan of the _De Oratore_,\r\nthe most finished perhaps of Cicero's compositions. An air of grandeur\r\nand magnificence reigns throughout. The characters of the aged senators\r\nare finely conceived, and the whole company is invested with an almost\r\nreligious majesty, from the allusions interspersed to the melancholy\r\ndestinies for which its members were reserved.\r\n\r\nHis treatise _De claris Oratoribus_ was written after an interval of\r\nnine years, about the time of Cato's death, when he was sixty-one, and\r\nis thrown into the shape of a dialogue between Brutus, Atticus, and\r\nhimself. He begins with Solon, and after briefly mentioning the orators\r\nof Greece, proceeds to those of his own country, so as to take in the\r\nwhole period from the time of Junius Brutus down to himself. About the\r\nsame time he wrote his _Orator_; in which he directs his attention\r\nprincipally to diction and delivery, as in his _De Inventione_ and\r\n_Topica_ he considers the matter of an oration.[211] This treatise is of\r\na less practical nature than the rest.[212] It adopts the principles of\r\nPlato, and delineates the perfect orator according to the abstract\r\nconceptions of the intellect rather than the deductions of observation\r\nand experience. Hence he sets out with a definition of the perfectly\r\neloquent man, whose characteristic it is to express himself with\r\npropriety on all subjects, whether humble, great, or of an intermediate\r\ncharacter;[213] and here he has an opportunity of paying some indirect\r\ncompliments to himself. With this work he was so well satisfied that he\r\ndoes not scruple to declare, in a letter to a friend, that he was ready\r\nto rest on its merits his reputation for judgment in Oratory.[214]\r\n\r\nThe treatise _De partitione Oratoriâ_, or on the three parts of\r\nrhetoric, is a kind of catechism between Cicero and his son, drawn up\r\nfor the use of the latter at the same time with the two preceding. It is\r\nthe most systematic and perspicuous of his rhetorical works, but seems\r\nto be but the rough draught of what he originally intended.[215]\r\n\r\n\r\n10.\r\n\r\nThe connection which we have been able to preserve between the\r\nrhetorical writings of Cicero cannot be attained in his moral,\r\npolitical, and metaphysical treatises; partly from the extent of the\r\nsubject, partly from the losses occasioned by time, partly from the\r\ninconsistency which we have warned the reader to expect in his\r\nsentiments. In our enumeration, therefore, we shall observe no other\r\norder than that which the date of their composition furnishes.\r\n\r\nThe earliest now extant is part of his treatise _De Legibus_, in three\r\nbooks; being a sequel to his work on Politics. Both were written in\r\nimitation of Plato's treatises on the same subjects.[216] The latter of\r\nthese (_De Republicâ_) was composed a year after the _De Oratore_,[217]\r\nand seems to have vied with it in the majesty and interest of the\r\ndialogue. It consisted of a series of discussions in six books on the\r\norigin and principles of government, Scipio being the principal speaker,\r\nbut Lælius, Philus, Manilius, and other personages of like gravity\r\ntaking part in the conversation. Till lately, but a fragment of the\r\nfifth book was understood to be in existence, in which Scipio, under the\r\nfiction of a dream, inculcates the doctrine of the immortality of the\r\nsoul. But in the year 1822, Monsignor Mai, librarian of the Vatican,\r\npublished considerable portions of the first and second books, from a\r\npalimpsest manuscript of St. Austin's _Commentary on the Psalms_. In the\r\npart now recovered, Scipio discourses on the different kinds of\r\nconstitutions and their respective advantages; with a particular\r\nreference to that of Rome. In the third book, the subject of justice was\r\ndiscussed by Lælius and Philus; in the fourth, Scipio treated of morals\r\nand education; while in the fifth and sixth, the duties of a magistrate\r\nwere explained, and the best means of preventing changes and revolutions\r\nin the constitution itself. In the latter part of the treatise, allusion\r\nwas made to the actual posture of affairs in Rome, when the conversation\r\nwas supposed to have occurred, and the commotions excited by the\r\nGracchi.\r\n\r\nIn his treatise _De Legibus_, which was written two years later than the\r\n_De Republicâ_, when he was fifty-five, and shortly after the murder of\r\nClodius, he represents himself as explaining to his brother Quintus and\r\nAtticus, in their walks through the woods of Arpinum, the nature and\r\norigin of the laws and their actual state, both in other countries and\r\nin Rome. The first part only of the subject is contained in the books\r\nnow extant; the introduction to which we have had occasion to notice,\r\nwhen speaking of his Stoical sentiments on questions connected with\r\nState policy. Law he pronounces to be the perfection of reason, the\r\neternal mind, the divine energy, which, while it pervades and unites in\r\none the whole universe, associates gods and men by the more intimate\r\nresemblance of reason and virtue, and still more closely men with men,\r\nby the participation of common faculties, affections, and situations. He\r\nthen proves, at length, that justice is not merely created by civil\r\ninstitutions, from the power of conscience, the imperfections of human\r\nlaw, the moral sense, and the disinterestedness of virtue. He next\r\nproceeds to unfold the principles, first, of religious law, under the\r\nheads of divine worship; the observance of festivals and games; the\r\noffice of priests, augurs, and heralds; the punishment of sacrilege and\r\npurjury; the consecration of land, and the rights of sepulchre; and,\r\nsecondly, of civil law, which gives him an opportunity of noticing the\r\nrespective duties of magistrates and citizens. In these discussions,\r\nthough professedly speaking of the abstract question, he does not\r\nhesitate to anticipate the subject of the lost books, by frequent\r\nallusions to the history and customs of his own country. It must be\r\nadded, that in no part of his writings do worse instances occur, than in\r\nthis treatise, of that vanity which was notoriously his weakness, which\r\nare rendered doubly offensive by their being put into the mouth of his\r\nbrother and Atticus.[218]\r\n\r\nHere a period of seven or eight years intervenes, during which he\r\ncomposed little of importance besides his Orations. He then published\r\nthe _De claris Oratoribus_ and _Orator_; and a year later, when he was\r\nsixty-three, his _Academicæ Quæstiones_, in the retirement from public\r\nbusiness to which he was driven by the dictatorship of Cæsar. This work\r\nhad originally consisted of two dialogues, which he entitled _Catulus_\r\nand _Lucullus_, from the names of the respective speakers in each. These\r\nhe now remodelled and enlarged into four books, dedicating them to\r\nVarro, whom he introduced as advocating, in the presence of Atticus, the\r\ntenets of Antiochus, while he himself defended those of Philo. Of this\r\nmost valuable composition, only the second book (_Lucullus_) of the\r\nfirst edition and part of the first book of the second are now extant.\r\nIn the former of those two, Lucullus argues against, and Cicero for, the\r\nAcademic sect, in the presence of Catulus and Hortensius; in the latter,\r\nVarro pursues the history of philosophy from Socrates to Arcesilas, and\r\nCicero continues it down to the time of Carneades. In the second edition\r\nthe style was corrected, the matter condensed, and the whole polished\r\nwith extraordinary care and diligence.[219]\r\n\r\nThe same year he published his treatise _De Finibus_, or \"On the chief\r\ngood,\" in five books, in which are explained the sentiments of the\r\nEpicureans, Stoics, and Peripatetics on the subject. This is the\r\nearliest of his works in which the dialogue is of a disputatious\r\ncharacter. It is opened with a defence of the Epicurean tenets,\r\nconcerning pleasure, by Torquatus; to which Cicero replies at length.\r\nThe scene then shifts from the Cuman villa to the library of young\r\nLucullus (his father being dead), where the Stoic Cato expatiates on the\r\nsublimity of the system which maintains the existence of one only good,\r\nand is answered by Cicero in the character of a Peripatetic. Lastly,\r\nPiso, in a conversation held at Athens, enters into an explanation of\r\nthe doctrine of Aristotle, that happiness is the greatest good. The\r\ngeneral style of this treatise is elegant and perspicuous; and the last\r\nbook in particular has great variety and splendour of diction.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that Cicero was especially courted by the heads\r\nof the dictator's party, of whom Hirtius and Dolabella went so far as to\r\ndeclaim daily at his house for the benefit of his instructions.[220] A\r\nvisit of this nature to the Tusculan villa, soon after the publication\r\nof the _De Finibus_, gave rise to his work entitled _Tusculanæ\r\nQuæstiones_, which professes to be the substance of five philosophical\r\ndisputes between himself and friends, digested into as many books. He\r\nargues throughout after the manner of an Academic, even with an\r\naffectation of inconsistency; sometimes making use of the Socratic\r\ndialogue, sometimes launching out into the diffuse expositions which\r\ncharacterise his other treatises.[221] He first disputes against the\r\nfear of death; and in so doing he adopts the opinion of the Platonic\r\nschool, as regards the nature of God and the soul. The succeeding\r\ndiscussions on enduring pain, on alleviating grief, on the other\r\nemotions of the mind, and on virtue, are conducted for the most part on\r\nStoical principles.[222] This is a highly ornamental composition, and\r\ncontains more quotations from the poets than any other of Cicero's\r\ntreatises.\r\n\r\nWe have already had occasion to remark upon the singular activity of his\r\nmind, which becomes more and more conspicuous as we approach the period\r\nof his death. During the ensuing year, which is the last of his life,\r\nin the midst of the confusion and anxieties consequent on Cæsar's\r\ndeath, and the party warfare of his Philippics, he found time to write\r\nthe _De Naturâ Deorum_, _De Divinatione_, _De Fato_, _De Senectute_, _De\r\nAmicitiâ_, _De Officiis_, and _Paradoxa_, besides the treatise on\r\nRhetorical Common Places above mentioned.\r\n\r\nOf these, the first three were intended as a full exposition of the\r\nconflicting opinions entertained on their respective subjects; the _De\r\nFato_, however, was not finished according to this plan.[223] His\r\ntreatise _De Naturâ Deorum_, in three books, may be reckoned the most\r\nsplendid of all his works, and shows that neither age nor disappointment\r\nhad done injury to the richness and vigour of his mind. In the first\r\nbook, Velleius, the Epicurean, sets forth the physical tenets of his\r\nsect, and is answered by Cotta, who is of the Academic school. In the\r\nsecond, Balbus, the disciple of the Porch, gives an account of his own\r\nsystem, and is, in turn, refuted by Cotta in the third. The eloquent\r\nextravagance of the Epicurean, the solemn enthusiasm of the Stoic, and\r\nthe brilliant raillery of the Academic, are contrasted with extreme\r\nvivacity and humour;--while the sublimity of the subject itself imparts\r\nto the whole composition a grander and more elevated character, and\r\ndiscovers in the author imaginative powers, which, celebrated as he\r\njustly is for playfulness of fancy, might yet appear more the talent of\r\nthe poet than the orator.\r\n\r\nHis treatise _De Divinatione_ is conveyed in a discussion between his\r\nbrother Quintus and himself, in two books. In the former, Quintus, after\r\ndividing Divination into the heads of natural and artificial, argues\r\nwith the Stoics for its sacred nature, from the evidence of facts, the\r\nagreement of all nations, and the existence of divine intelligences. In\r\nthe latter, Cicero questions its authority, with Carneades, from the\r\nuncertain nature of its rules, the absurdity and uselessness of the art,\r\nand the possibility of accounting from natural causes for the phenomena\r\non which it was founded. This is a curious work, from the numerous cases\r\nadduced from the histories of Greece and Rome to illustrate the subject\r\nin dispute.\r\n\r\nHis treatise _De Fato_ is quite a fragment; it purports to be the\r\nsubstance of a dissertation in which he explained to Hirtius (soon after\r\nConsul) the sentiments of Chrysippus, Diodorus, Epicurus, Carneades, and\r\nothers, upon that abstruse subject. It is supposed to have consisted at\r\nleast of two books, of which we have but the proem of the first, and a\r\nsmall portion of the second.\r\n\r\nIn his beautiful compositions, _De Senectute_ and _De Amicitiâ_, Cato\r\nthe censor and Lælius are respectively introduced, delivering their\r\nsentiments on those subjects. The conclusion of the former, in which\r\nCato discourses on the immortality of the soul, has been always\r\ncelebrated; and the opening of the latter, in which Fannius and Scævola\r\ncome to console Lælius on the death of Scipio, is as exquisite an\r\ninstance of delicacy and taste in composition as can be found in his\r\nworks. In the latter he has borrowed largely from the eighth and ninth\r\nbooks of Aristotle's _Ethics_.\r\n\r\nHis treatise _De Officiis_ was finished about the time he wrote his\r\nsecond Philippic, a circumstance which illustrates the great versatility\r\nof his mental powers. Of a work so extensively celebrated, it is enough\r\nto have mentioned the name. Here he lays aside the less authoritative\r\nform of dialogue, and, with the dignity of the Roman Consul, unfolds, in\r\nhis own person, the principles of morals, according to the views of the\r\nolder schools, particularly of the Stoics. It is written in three\r\nbooks, with great perspicuity and elegance of style; the first book\r\ntreats of the _honestum_, or _virtue_, the second of the _utile_, or\r\n_expedience_, and the third adjusts the claims of the two, when they\r\nhappen to interfere with each other.\r\n\r\nHis _Paradoxa Stoicorum_ might have been more suitably, perhaps,\r\nincluded in his rhetorical works, being six short declamations in\r\nsupport of the positions of Zeno; in which that philosopher's subtleties\r\nare adapted to the comprehension of the vulgar, and the events of the\r\ntimes. The second, fourth, and sixth, are respectively directed against\r\nAntony, Clodius, and Crassus. They seem to have suffered from time.[224]\r\nThe sixth is the most eloquent, but the argument of the third is\r\nstrikingly maintained.\r\n\r\nBesides the works now enumerated, we have a considerable fragment of his\r\ntranslation of Plato's _Timæus_, which he seems to have finished in his\r\nlast year. His remaining philosophical works, viz.: the _Hortensius_,\r\nwhich was a defence of philosophy; _De Gloriâ_; _De Consolatione_,\r\nwritten upon Platonic principles on his daughter's death; _De Jure\r\nCivili_, _De Virtutibus_, _De Auguriis_, _Chorographia_, translations of\r\nPlato's _Protagoras_, and Xenophon's _OEconomics_, works on Natural\r\nHistory, Panegyric on Cato, and some miscellaneous writings, are, except\r\na few fragments, entirely lost.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHis Letters, about one thousand in all, are comprised in thirty-six\r\nbooks, sixteen of which are addressed to Atticus, three to his brother\r\nQuintus, one to Brutus, and sixteen to his different friends; and they\r\nform a history of his life from his fortieth year. Among those addressed\r\nto his friends, some occur from Brutus, Metellus, Plancius, Cælius, and\r\nothers. For the preservation of this most valuable department of\r\nCicero's writings, we are indebted to Tyro, the author's freedman,\r\nthough we possess, at the present day, but a part of those originally\r\npublished. As his correspondence with his friends belongs to his\r\ncharacter as a man and politician, rather than to his literary aspect,\r\nwe have already noticed it in the first part of this memoir.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHis Poetical and Historical works have suffered a heavier fate. The\r\nlatter class, consisting of his commentary on his consulship and his\r\nhistory of his own times, is altogether lost. Of the former, which\r\nconsisted of the heroic poems _Halcyone_, _Limon_, _Marius_, and his\r\nConsulate, the elegy of _Tamelastes_, translations of Homer and Aratus,\r\nepigrams, etc., nothing remains, except some fragments of the\r\n_Phænomena_ and _Diosemeia_ of Aratus. It may, however, be questioned\r\nwhether literature has suffered much by these losses. We are far,\r\nindeed, from speaking contemptuously of the poetical talent of one who\r\npossessed so much fancy, so much taste, and so fine an ear.[225] But his\r\npoems were principally composed in his youth; and afterwards, when his\r\npowers were more mature, his occupations did not allow even to his\r\nactive mind the time necessary for polishing a language still more\r\nrugged in metre than it was in prose. His contemporary history, on the\r\nother hand, can hardly have conveyed more explicit, and certainly would\r\nhave contained less faithful, information than his private\r\ncorrespondence; while, with all the penetration he assuredly possessed,\r\nit may be doubted if his diffuse and graceful style was adapted for the\r\ndeep and condensed thoughts and the grasp of facts and events which are\r\nthe chief excellences of historical composition.\r\n\r\n\r\n11.\r\n\r\nThe Orations which he is known to have composed amount in all to about\r\neighty, of which fifty-nine, either entire or in part, are preserved. Of\r\nthese some are deliberative, others judicial, others descriptive; some\r\ndelivered from the rostrum, or in the senate; others in the forum, or\r\nbefore Cæsar; and, as might be anticipated from the character already\r\ngiven of his talents, he is much more successful in pleading or in\r\npanegyric than in debate or invective. In deliberative oratory, indeed,\r\ngreat part of the effect of the composition depends on its creating in\r\nthe hearer a high opinion of the speaker; and, though Cicero takes\r\nconsiderable pains to interest the audience in his favour, yet his style\r\nis not simple and grave enough, he is too ingenious, too declamatory,\r\ndiscovers too much personal feeling, to elicit that confidence in him,\r\nwithout which argument has little influence. His invectives, again,\r\nhowever grand and imposing, yet, compared with his calmer and more\r\nfamiliar productions, have a forced and unnatural air. Splendid as is\r\nthe eloquence of his Catilinarians and Philippics, it is often the\r\nlanguage of abuse rather than of indignation; and even his attack on\r\nPiso, the most brilliant and imaginative of its kind, becomes wearisome\r\nfrom want of ease and relief. His laudatory orations, on the other hand,\r\nare among his happiest efforts. Nothing can exceed the taste and beauty\r\nof those for the Manilian law, for Marcellus, for Ligarius, for Archias,\r\nand the ninth Philippic, which is principally in praise of Servius\r\nSulpicius. But it is in judicial eloquence, particularly on subjects of\r\na lively cast, as in his speeches for Cælius and Muræna, and against\r\nCæcilius, that his talents are displayed to the best advantage. In both\r\nthese departments of oratory the grace and amiableness of his genius\r\nare manifested in their full lustre, though none of his orations are\r\nwithout tokens of those characteristic excellences. Historical\r\nallusions, philosophical sentiments, descriptions full of life and\r\nnature, and polite raillery, succeed each other in the most agreeable\r\nmanner, without appearance of artifice or effort. Such are his pictures\r\nof the confusion of the Catilinarian conspirators on detection;[226] of\r\nthe death of Metellus;[227] of Sulpicius undertaking the embassy to\r\nAntony;[228] the character he draws of Catiline;[229] and his fine\r\nsketch of old Appius, frowning on his degenerate descendant Clodia.[230]\r\n\r\nThese, however, are but incidental and occasional artifices to divert\r\nand refresh the mind, since his Orations are generally laid out\r\naccording to the plan proposed in rhetorical works; the introduction,\r\ncontaining the ethical proof; the body of the speech, the argument, and\r\nthe peroration addressing itself to the passions of the judges. In\r\nopening his case, he commonly makes a profession of timidity and\r\ndiffidence, with a view to conciliate the favour of his audience; the\r\neloquence, for instance, of Hortensius, is so powerful,[231] or so much\r\nprejudice has been excited against his client,[232] or it is his first\r\nappearance in the rostrum,[233] or he is unused to speak in an armed\r\nassembly,[234] or to plead in a private apartment.[235] He proceeds to\r\nentreat the patience of his judges; drops out some generous or popular\r\nsentiment, or contrives to excite prejudice against his opponent. He\r\nthen states the circumstances of his case, and the intended plan of his\r\noration; and here he is particularly clear. But it is when he comes\r\nactually to prove his point that his oratorical powers begin to have\r\ntheir full play. He accounts for everything so naturally, makes trivial\r\ncircumstances tell so happily, so adroitly converts apparent objections\r\ninto confirmations of his argument, connects independent facts with such\r\nease and plausibility, that it becomes impossible to entertain a\r\nquestion on the truth of his statement. This is particularly observable\r\nin his defence of Cluentius, where prejudices, suspicions, and\r\ndifficulties are encountered with the most triumphant ingenuity; in the\r\nantecedent probabilities of his _Pro Milone_;[236] in his apology for\r\nMuræna's public,[237] and Cælius's private life,[238] and his\r\ndisparagement of Verres's military services in Sicily;[239] it is\r\nobservable too in the address with which the Agrarian law of\r\nRullus,[240] and the accusation of Rabirius,[241] both popular measures,\r\nare represented to be hostile to public liberty; with which Milo's\r\nimpolitic unconcern is made a touching incident;[242] and Cato's attack\r\nupon the crowd of clients which accompanied the candidate for office, a\r\ntyrannical disregard for the feelings of the poor.[243] So great indeed\r\nis his talent, that he even hurts a good cause by an excess of\r\nplausibility.\r\n\r\nBut it is not enough to have barely proved his point; he proceeds,\r\neither immediately, or towards the conclusion of his speech, to heighten\r\nthe effect by amplification.[244] Here he goes (as it were) round and\r\nround his object; surveys it in every light; examines it in all its\r\nparts; retires, and then advances; turns and re-turns it; compares and\r\ncontrasts it; illustrates, confirms, enforces his view of the question,\r\ntill at last the hearer feels ashamed of doubting a position which seems\r\nbuilt on a foundation so strictly argumentative. Of this nature is his\r\njustification of Rabirius in taking up arms against Saturninus;[245] his\r\naccount of the imprisonment of the Roman citizens by Verres, and of the\r\ncrucifixion of Gavius;[246] his comparison of Antony with Tarquin;[247]\r\nand the contrast he draws of Verres with Fabius, Scipio, and\r\nMarius.[248]\r\n\r\nAnd now, having established his case, he opens upon his opponent a\r\ndischarge of raillery, so delicate and good-natured, that it is\r\nimpossible for the latter to maintain his ground against it. Or where\r\nthe subject is too grave to admit this, he colours his exaggeration with\r\nall the bitterness of irony or vehemence of passion. Such are his\r\nfrequent delineations of Gabinius, Piso, Clodius, and Antony;[249]\r\nparticularly his vivid and almost humorous contrast of the two consuls,\r\nwho sanctioned his banishment, in his oration for Sextius.[250] Such the\r\ncelebrated account (already referred to) of the crucifixion of Gavius by\r\nVerres, which it is difficult to read, even at the present day, without\r\nhaving our feelings roused against the merciless Prætor. But the appeal\r\nto the gentler emotions of the soul is reserved (perhaps with somewhat\r\nof sameness) for the close of his oration; as in his defence of\r\nCluentius, Muræna, Cælius, Milo, Sylla, Flaccus, and Rabirius Postumus;\r\nthe most striking instances of which are the poetical burst of feeling\r\nwith which he addresses his client Plancius,[251] and his picture of the\r\ndesolate condition of the Vestal Fonteia, should her brother be\r\ncondemned.[252] At other times, his peroration contains more heroic and\r\nelevated sentiments; as in his invocation of the Alban groves and altars\r\nin the peroration of the _Pro Milone_, the panegyric on patriotism, and\r\nthe love of glory in his defence of Sextius, and that on liberty at the\r\nclose of the third and tenth Philippics.[253]\r\n\r\n\r\n12.\r\n\r\nBut it is by the invention of a style, which adapts itself with singular\r\nfelicity to every class of subjects, whether lofty or familiar,\r\nphilosophical or forensic, that Cicero answers even more exactly to his\r\nown definition of a perfect orator[254] than by his plausibility,\r\npathos, and brilliancy. It is not, however, here intended to enter upon\r\nthe consideration of a subject so ample and so familiar to all scholars\r\nas Cicero's diction, much less to take an extended view of it through\r\nthe range of his philosophical writings and familiar correspondence.\r\nAmong many excellences, the greatest is its suitableness to the genius\r\nof the Latin language; though the diffuseness thence necessarily\r\nresulting has exposed it, both in his own days and since his time, to\r\nthe criticisms of those who have affected to condemn its Asiatic\r\ncharacter, in comparison with the simplicity of Attic writers, and the\r\nstrength of Demosthenes.[255] Greek, however, is celebrated for its\r\ncopiousness in vocabulary, for its perspicuity, and its reproductive\r\npower; and its consequent facility of expressing the most novel or\r\nabstruse ideas with precision and elegance. Hence the Attic style of\r\neloquence was plain and simple, because simplicity and plainness were\r\nnot incompatible with clearness, energy, and harmony. But it was a\r\nsingular want of judgment, an ignorance of the very principles of\r\ncomposition, which induced Brutus, Calvus, Sallust, and others to\r\nimitate this terse and severe beauty in their own defective language,\r\nand even to pronounce the opposite kind of diction deficient in taste\r\nand purity. In Greek, indeed, the words fall, as it were, naturally,\r\ninto a distinct and harmonious order; and, from the exuberant richness\r\nof the materials, less is left to the ingenuity of the artist. But the\r\nLatin language is comparatively weak, scanty, and unmusical; and\r\nrequires considerable skill and management to render it expressive and\r\ngraceful. Simplicity in Latin is scarcely separable from baldness; and\r\njustly as Terence is celebrated for chaste and unadorned diction, yet,\r\neven he, compared with Attic writers, is flat and heavy.[256] Again, the\r\nperfection of strength is clearness united to brevity; but to this\r\ncombination Latin is utterly unequal. From the vagueness and uncertainty\r\nof meaning which characterises its separate words, to be perspicuous it\r\nmust be full. What Livy, and much more Tacitus, have gained in energy,\r\nthey have lost in lucidity and elegance; the correspondence of Brutus\r\nwith Cicero is forcible, indeed, but harsh and abrupt. Latin, in short,\r\nis not a philosophical language, not a language in which a deep thinker\r\nis likely to express himself with purity or neatness. Cicero found it\r\nbarren and dissonant, and as such he had to deal with it. His good sense\r\nenabled him to perceive what could be done, and what it was in vain to\r\nattempt; and happily his talents answered precisely to the purpose\r\nrequired. He may be compared to a clever landscape-gardener, who gives\r\ndepth and richness to narrow and confined premises by ingenuity and\r\nskill in the disposition of his trees and walks. Terence and Lucretius\r\nhad cultivated simplicity; Cotta, Brutus, and Calvus had attempted\r\nstrength; but Cicero rather made a language than a style; yet not so\r\nmuch by the invention as by the combination of words. Some terms,\r\nindeed, his philosophical subjects obliged him to coin;[257] but his\r\ngreat art lies in the application of existing materials, in converting\r\nthe very disadvantages of the language into beauties,[258] in enriching\r\nit with circumlocutions and metaphors, in pruning it of harsh and\r\nuncouth expressions, in systematizing the structure of a sentence.[259]\r\nThis is that _copia dicendi_ which gained Cicero the high testimony of\r\nCæsar to his inventive powers,[260] and which, we may add, constitutes\r\nhim the greatest master of composition that the world has seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n13.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, are the principal characteristics of Cicero's oratory; on a\r\nreview of which we may, with some reason, conclude that Roman eloquence\r\nstands scarcely less indebted to his works than Roman philosophy. For,\r\nthough in his _De claris Oratoribus_ he begins his review from the age\r\nof Junius Brutus, yet, soberly speaking (and as he seems to allow in the\r\nopening of the _De Oratore_), we cannot assign an earlier date to the\r\nrise of eloquence among his countrymen, than that of the same Athenian\r\nembassy which introduced the study of philosophy. To aim, indeed, at\r\npersuasion, by appeals to the reason or passions, is so natural, that no\r\ncountry, whether refined or barbarous, is without its orators. If,\r\nhowever, eloquence be the mere power of persuading, it is but a relative\r\nterm, limited to time and place, connected with a particular audience,\r\nand leaving to posterity no test of its merits but the report of those\r\nwhom it has been successful in influencing; but we are speaking of it as\r\nthe subject-matter of an art.[261]\r\n\r\nThe eloquence of Carneades and his associates had made (to use a\r\nfamiliar term) a great sensation among the Roman orators, who soon split\r\ninto two parties,--the one adhering to the rough unpolished manners of\r\ntheir forefathers, the other favouring the artificial graces which\r\ndistinguished the Grecian rhetoricians. In the former class were Cato\r\nand Lælius,[262] both men of cultivated minds, particularly Cato, whose\r\nopposition to Greek literature was founded solely on political\r\nconsiderations. But, as might have been expected, the Athenian cause had\r\nprevailed; and Carbo and the two Gracchi, who are the principal orators\r\nof the next generation, are praised as masters of an oratory learned,\r\nmajestic, and harmonious in its character.[263] These were succeeded by\r\nAntonius, Crassus, Cotta, Sulpicius, and Hortensius; who, adopting\r\ngreater liveliness and variety of manner, form a middle age in the\r\nhistory of Roman eloquence. But it was in that which immediately\r\nfollowed that the art was adorned by an assemblage of orators, which\r\neven Greece will find it difficult to match. Of these Cæsar, Cicero,\r\nCurio, Brutus, Cælius, Calvus, and Callidius, are the most celebrated.\r\nThe talents, indeed, of Cæsar were not more conspicuous in arms than in\r\nhis style, which was noted for its force and purity.[264] Cælius, whom\r\nCicero brought forward into public life, excelled in natural quickness,\r\nloftiness of sentiment, and politeness in attack;[265] Brutus in\r\nphilosophical gravity, though he sometimes indulged himself in a warmer\r\nand bolder style.[266] Callidius was delicate and harmonious; Curio bold\r\nand flowing; Calvus, from studied opposition to Cicero's peculiarities,\r\ncold, cautious, and accurate.[267] Brutus and Calvus have been before\r\nnoticed as the advocates of the dry sententious mode of speaking, which\r\nthey dignified by the name of Attic; a kind of eloquence which seems to\r\nhave been popular from the comparative facility with which it was\r\nattained.\r\n\r\nIn the Ciceronian age the general character of the oratory was dignified\r\nand graceful. The popular nature of the government gave opportunities\r\nfor effective appeals to the passions; and, Greek literature being as\r\nyet a novelty, philosophical sentiments were introduced with\r\ncorresponding success. The republican orators were long in their\r\nintroductions, diffuse in their statements, ample in their divisions,\r\nfrequent in their digressions, gradual and sedate in their\r\nperorations.[268] Under the Emperors, however, the people were less\r\nconsulted in state affairs; and the judges, instead of possessing an\r\nalmost independent authority, being but delegates of the executive, from\r\ninterested politicians became men of business; literature, too, was now\r\nfamiliar to all classes; and taste began sensibly to decline. The\r\nnational appetite felt a craving for stronger and more stimulating\r\ncompositions. Impatience was manifested at the tedious majesty and\r\nformal graces, the parade of arguments, grave sayings, and shreds of\r\nphilosophy,[269] which characterized their fathers; and a smarter and\r\nmore sparkling kind of oratory succeeded,[270] just as in our own\r\ncountry the minuet of the last century has been supplanted by the\r\nquadrille, and the stately movements of Giardini have given way to\r\nRossini's brisker and more artificial melodies. Corvinus, even before\r\nthe time of Augustus, had shown himself more elaborate and fastidious in\r\nhis choice of expressions.[271] Cassius Severus, the first who openly\r\ndeviated from the old style of oratory, introduced an acrimonious and\r\nvirulent mode of pleading.[272] It now became the fashion to decry\r\nCicero as inflated, languid, tame, and even deficient in ornament;[273]\r\nMecænas and Gallio followed in the career of degeneracy; till flippancy\r\nof attack, prettiness of expression, and glitter of decoration prevailed\r\nover the bold and manly eloquence of free Rome.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[93] De Legg. i. 1, ii. 1.\r\n\r\n[94] Contra Rull. ii. 1.\r\n\r\n[95] De Legg. ii. 1, iii. 16; de Orat. ii. 66.\r\n\r\n[96] Plutarch, in Vitâ.\r\n\r\n[97] Middleton's Life, vol. i. p. 13. 4to; de Clar.

It is curious to observe how he converts the\r\nalleviating circumstances of his case into exaggerations of his\r\nmisfortune: he writes to Atticus: \"As to your many fierce objurgations\r\nof me, for my weakness of mind, I ask you, what aggravation is wanting\r\nto my calamity?

BUT AN IMITATION OF SCRIPTURE MIRACLES                     328\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPOLLONIUS OF TYANA.\r\n\r\n\r\nApollonius, the Pythagorean philosopher, was born at Tyana, in\r\nCappadocia, in the year of Rome 750, four years before the common\r\nChristian era.[274] His reputation rests, not so much on his personal\r\nmerits, as on the attempt made in the early ages of the Church, and\r\nsince revived,[275] to bring him forward as a rival to the Divine Author\r\nof our Religion. A narrative of his life, which is still extant, was\r\nwritten with this object, about a century after his death (A.D. 217), by\r\nPhilostratus of Lemnos, when Ammonius was systematizing the Eclectic\r\ntenets to meet the increasing influence and the spread of Christianity.\r\nPhilostratus engaged in this work at the instance of his patroness Julia\r\nDomna, wife of the Emperor Severus, a princess celebrated for her zeal\r\nin the cause of Heathen Philosophy; who put into his hands a journal of\r\nthe travels of Apollonius rudely written by one Damis, an Assyrian, his\r\ncompanion.[276] This manuscript, an account of his residence at Ægæ,\r\nprior to his acquaintance with Damis, by Maximus of that city, a\r\ncollection of his letters, some private memoranda relative to his\r\nopinions and conduct, and lastly the public records of the cities he\r\nfrequented, were the principal documents from which Philostratus\r\ncompiled his elaborate narrative.[277] It is written with considerable\r\nelegance and command of Greek, but with more attention to ornament than\r\nis consistent with correct taste. Though it is not a professed imitation\r\nof the Gospels, it contains quite enough to show that it was written\r\nwith a view of rivalling the sacred narrative; and accordingly, in the\r\nfollowing age, it was made use of in a direct attack upon Christianity\r\nby Hierocles,[278] Prefect of Bithynia, a disciple of the Eclectic\r\nSchool, to whom a reply was made by Eusebius of Cæsarea. The selection\r\nof a Pythagorean Philosopher for the purpose of a comparison with our\r\nLord was judicious. The attachment of the Pythagorean Sect to the\r\ndiscipline of the established religion, which most other philosophies\r\nneglected, its austerity, its pretended intercourse with heaven, its\r\nprofession of extraordinary power over nature, and the authoritative\r\ntone of teaching which this profession countenanced,[279] were all in\r\nfavour of the proposed object. But with the plans of the Eclectics in\r\ntheir attack upon Christianity we have no immediate concern.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\nPhilostratus begins his work with an account of the prodigies attending\r\nthe philosopher's birth, which, with all circumstances of a like nature,\r\nwe shall for the present pass over, intending to make some observations\r\non them in the sequel. At the age of fourteen he was placed by his\r\nfather under the care of Euthydemus, a distinguished rhetorician of\r\nTarsus; but, being displeased with the dissipation of the place, he\r\nremoved with his master to Ægæ, a neighbouring town, frequented as a\r\nretreat for students in philosophy.[280] Here he made himself master of\r\nthe Platonic, Stoic, Epicurean, and Peripatetic systems; giving,\r\nhowever, an exclusive preference to the Pythagorean, which he studied\r\nwith Euxenus of Heraclea, a man, however, whose life ill accorded with\r\nthe ascetic principles of his Sect. At the early age of sixteen years,\r\naccording to his biographer, he resolved on strictly conforming himself\r\nto the precepts of Pythagoras, and, if possible, rivalling the fame of\r\nhis master. He renounced animal food and wine; restricted himself to the\r\nuse of linen garments and sandals made of the bark of trees; suffered\r\nhis hair to grow; and betook himself to the temple of Æsculapius, who is\r\nsaid to have regarded him with peculiar favour.[281]\r\n\r\nOn the news of his father's death, which took place not long afterwards,\r\nhe left Ægæ for his native place, where he gave up half his inheritance\r\nto his elder brother, whom he is said to have reclaimed from a dissolute\r\ncourse of life, and the greater part of the remainder to his poorer\r\nrelatives.[282]\r\n\r\nPrior to composing any philosophical work, he thought it necessary to\r\nobserve the silence of five years, which was the appointed initiation\r\ninto the esoteric doctrines of his Sect. During this time he exercised\r\nhis mind in storing up materials for future reflection. We are told that\r\non several occasions he hindered insurrections in the cities in which he\r\nresided by the mute eloquence of his look and gestures;[283] but such an\r\nachievement is hardly consistent with the Pythagorean rule, which\r\nforbad its disciples during their silence the intercourse of mixed\r\nsociety.[284]\r\n\r\nThe period of silence being expired, Apollonius passed through the\r\nprincipal cities of Asia Minor, disputing in the temples in imitation of\r\nPythagoras, unfolding the mysteries of his Sect to such as were\r\nobserving their probationary silence, discoursing with the Greek Priests\r\nabout divine rites, and reforming the worship of barbarian cities.[285]\r\nThis must have been his employment for many years; the next incident in\r\nhis life being his Eastern journey, which was not undertaken till he was\r\nbetween forty and fifty years of age.[286]\r\n\r\nHis object in this expedition was to consult the Magi and Brachmans on\r\nphilosophical matters; still following the example of Pythagoras, who is\r\nsaid to have travelled as far as India with the same purpose. At\r\nNineveh, where he arrived with two companions, he was joined by Damis,\r\nalready mentioned as his journalist.[287] Proceeding thence to Babylon,\r\nhe had some interviews with the Magi, who rather disappointed his\r\nexpectations; and was well received by Bardanes the Parthian King, who,\r\nafter detaining him at his Court for the greater part of two years,\r\ndismissed him with marks of peculiar honour.[288] From Babylon he\r\nproceeded, by way of the Caucasus and the Indus, to Taxila, the city of\r\nPhraotes, King of the Indians, who is represented as an adept in the\r\nPythagorean Philosophy;[289] and passing on, at length accomplished the\r\nobject of his expedition by visiting Iarchas, Chief of the Brachmans,\r\nfrom whom he is said to have learned many valuable theurgic\r\nsecrets.[290]\r\n\r\nOn his return to Asia Minor, after an absence of about five years, he\r\nstationed himself for a time in Ionia; where the fame of his travels and\r\nhis austere mode of life gained for him much attention to his\r\nphilosophical harangues. The cities sent embassies to him, decreeing him\r\npublic honours; while the oracles pronounced him more than mortal, and\r\nreferred the sick to him for relief.[291]\r\n\r\nFrom Ionia he passed over to Greece, and made his first tour through its\r\nprincipal cities;[292] visiting the temples and oracles, reforming the\r\ndivine rites, and sometimes exercising his theurgic skill. Except at\r\nSparta, however, he seems to have attracted little attention. At Eleusis\r\nhis application for admittance to the Mysteries was unsuccessful; as was\r\na similar attempt at the Cave of Trophonius at a later date.[293] In\r\nboth places his reputation for magical powers was the cause of his\r\nexclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\nHitherto our memoir has only set before us the life of an ordinary\r\nPythagorean, which may be comprehended in three words, mysticism,\r\ntravel, and disputation. From the date, however, of his journey to Rome,\r\nwhich succeeded his Grecian tour, it is in some degree connected with\r\nthe history of the times; and, though for much of what is told us of him\r\nwe have no better authority than the word of Philostratus himself, still\r\nthere is neither reason nor necessity for supposing the narrative to be\r\nin substance untrue.\r\n\r\nNero had at this time prohibited the study of philosophy, alleging that\r\nit was made the pretence for magical practices;[294]--and the report of\r\nhis tyrannical excesses so alarmed the followers of Apollonius as they\r\napproached Rome, that out of thirty-four who had accompanied him thus\r\nfar, eight only could be prevailed on to proceed. On his arrival, his\r\nreligious pretensions were the occasion of his being brought\r\nsuccessively before the consul Telesinus and Tigellinus the Minister of\r\nNero.[295] Both of them, however, dismissed him after an examination;\r\nthe former from a secret leaning towards philosophy, the latter from\r\nfear (as we are told) of his extraordinary powers. He was in consequence\r\nallowed to go about at his pleasure from temple to temple, haranguing\r\nthe people, and, as in Asia, prosecuting his reforms in the worship paid\r\nto the gods. This, however, can hardly have been the case, supposing the\r\nedict against philosophers was as severe as his biographer represents.\r\nIn that case neither Apollonius, nor Demetrius the Cynic, who joined him\r\nafter his arrival, would have been permitted to remain in Rome;\r\ncertainly not Apollonius, after his acknowledgment of his own magical\r\npowers in the presence of Tigellinus.[296]\r\n\r\nIt is more probable he was sent out of the city; anyhow we soon find him\r\nin Spain, taking part in the conspiracy forming against Nero by Vindex\r\nand others.[297] The political partisans of that day seem to have made\r\nuse of professed jugglers and magicians to gain over the body of the\r\npeople to their interests. To this may be attributed Nero's banishing\r\nsuch men from Rome;[298] and Apollonius had probably been already\r\nserviceable in this way at the Capital, as he was now in Spain, and\r\nimmediately after to Vespasian; and at a later period to Nerva.\r\n\r\nHis next expeditions were to Africa, to Sicily, and so to Greece,[299]\r\nbut they do not supply anything of importance to the elucidation of his\r\ncharacter. At Athens he obtained the initiation in the Mysteries, for\r\nwhich he had on his former visit unsuccessfully applied.\r\n\r\nThe following spring, the seventy-third of his life, according to the\r\ncommon calculation, he proceeded to Alexandria,[300] where he attracted\r\nthe notice of Vespasian, who had just assumed the purple, and who seemed\r\ndesirous of countenancing his proceedings by the sanction of religion.\r\nApollonius might be recommended to him for this purpose by the fame of\r\nhis travels, his reputation for theurgic knowledge, and his late acts in\r\nSpain against Nero. It is satisfactory to be able to detect an\r\nhistorical connexion between two personages, each of whom has in his\r\nturn been made to rival our Lord and His Apostles in pretensions to\r\nmiraculous power. Thus, claims which appeared to be advanced on distinct\r\ngrounds are found to proceed from one centre, and by their coalition to\r\nillustrate and expose one another. The celebrated cures by Vespasian are\r\nconnected with the ordinary theurgy of the Pythagorean School; and\r\nApollonius is found here, as in many other instances, to be the\r\ninstrument of a political party.\r\n\r\nHis biographer's account of his first meeting with the Emperor, which is\r\nperhaps substantially correct, is amusing from the theatrical character\r\nwith which it was invested.[301] The latter, on entering Alexandria, was\r\nmet by the great body of the Magistrates, Prefects, and Philosophers of\r\nthe city; but, not discovering Apollonius in the number, he hastily\r\nasked, \"whether the Tyanean was in Alexandria,\" and when told he was\r\nphilosophizing in the Serapeum, proceeding thither he suppliantly\r\nentreated him to make him Emperor; and, on the Philosopher's answering\r\nhe had already done so in praying for a just and venerable\r\nSovereign,[302] Vespasian avowed his determination of putting himself\r\nentirely into his hands, and of declining the supreme power, unless he\r\ncould obtain his countenance in assuming it.[303] A formal consultation\r\nwas in consequence held, at which, besides Apollonius, Dio and\r\nEuphrates, Stoics in the Emperor's train, were allowed to deliver their\r\nsentiments; when the latter philosopher entered an honest protest\r\nagainst the sanction which Apollonius was giving to the ambition of\r\nVespasian, and advocated the restoration of the Roman State to its\r\nancient republican form.[304] This difference of opinion laid the\r\nfoundation of a lasting quarrel between the rival advisers, to which\r\nPhilostratus makes frequent allusion in the course of his history.\r\nEuphrates is mentioned by the ancients in terms of high commendation; by\r\nPliny especially, who knew him well.[305] He seems to have seen through\r\nhis opponent's religious pretences, as we gather even from\r\nPhilostratus;[306] and when so plain a reason exists for the dislike\r\nwhich Apollonius, in his Letters, and Philostratus, manifest towards\r\nhim, their censure must not be allowed to weigh against the testimony,\r\nwhich unbiassed writers have delivered in his favour.\r\n\r\nAfter parting from Vespasian, Apollonius undertook an expedition into\r\nÆthiopia, where he held discussions with the Gymnosophists, and visited\r\nthe cataracts of the Nile.[307] On his return he received the news of\r\nthe destruction of Jerusalem; and being pleased with the modesty of the\r\nconqueror, wrote to him in commendation of it. Titus is said to have\r\ninvited him to Argos in Cilicia, for the sake of his advice on various\r\nsubjects, and obtained from him a promise that at some future time he\r\nwould visit him at Rome.[308]\r\n\r\nOn the succession of Domitian, he became once more engaged in the\r\npolitical commotions of the day, exerting himself to excite the\r\ncountries of Asia Minor against the Emperor.[309] These proceedings at\r\nlength occasioned an order from the Government to bring him to Rome,\r\nwhich, however, according to his biographer's account, he anticipated by\r\nvoluntarily surrendering himself, under the idea that by his prompt\r\nappearance he might remove the Emperor's jealousy, and save Nerva and\r\nothers whose political interests he had been promoting. On arriving at\r\nRome he was brought before Domitian; and when, very inconsistently with\r\nhis wish to shield his friends from suspicion, he launched out into\r\npraise of Nerva, he was forced away into prison to the company of the\r\nworst criminals, his hair and beard were cut short, and his limbs loaded\r\nwith chains. After some days he was brought to trial; the charges\r\nagainst him being the singularity of his dress and appearance, his being\r\ncalled a god, his foretelling a pestilence at Ephesus, and his\r\nsacrificing a child with Nerva for the purpose of augury.[310]\r\nPhilostratus supplies us with an ample defence, which, it seems, he was\r\nto have delivered,[311] had he not in the course of the proceedings\r\nsuddenly vanished from the Court, and transported himself to Puteoli,\r\nwhither he had before sent on Damis.\r\n\r\nThis is the only miraculous occurrence which forces itself into the\r\nhistory as a component part of the narrative; the rest being of easy\r\nomission without any detriment to its entireness.[312] And strictly\r\nspeaking, even here, it is only his vanishing which is of a miraculous\r\nnature, and his vanishing is not really necessary for the continuity of\r\nevents. His \"liberation\" and \"transportation\" are sufficient for that\r\ncontinuity; and to be set free from prison and sent out of Rome are\r\noccurrences which might happen without a divine interposition. And in\r\nfact they seem very clearly to have taken place in the regular course of\r\nbusiness. Philostratus allows that just before the philosopher's\r\npretended disappearance, Domitian had publicly acquitted him, and that\r\nafter the miracle he proceeded to hear the cause next in order, as if\r\nnothing had happened;[313] and tells us, moreover, that Apollonius on\r\nhis return to Greece gave out that he had pleaded his own cause and so\r\nescaped, no allusion being made to a miraculous preservation.[314]\r\n\r\nAfter spending two years in the latter country in his usual\r\nphilosophical disputations, he passed into Ionia. According to his\r\nbiographer's chronology, he was now approaching the completion of his\r\nhundredth year. We may easily understand, therefore, that when invited\r\nto Rome by Nerva, who had just succeeded to the Empire, he declined the\r\nproposed honour with an intimation that their meeting must be deferred\r\nto another state of being.[315] His death took place shortly after; and\r\nEphesus, Rhodes, and Crete are variously mentioned as the spot at which\r\nit occurred.[316] A temple was dedicated to him at Tyana,[317] which was\r\nin consequence accounted one of the sacred cities, and permitted the\r\nprivilege of electing its own Magistrates.[318]\r\n\r\nHe is said to have written[319] a treatise upon Judicial Astrology, a\r\nwork on Sacrifices, another on Oracles, a Life of Pythagoras, and an\r\naccount of the answers which he received from Trophonius, besides the\r\nmemoranda noticed in the opening of our memoir. A collection of Letters\r\nascribed to him is still extant.[320]\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\nIt may be regretted that so elaborate a history, as that which we have\r\nabridged, should not contain more authentic and valuable matter. Both\r\nthe secular transactions of the times and the history of Christianity\r\nmight have been illustrated by the life of one, who, while he was an\r\ninstrument of the partisans of Vindex, Vespasian, and Nerva, was a\r\ncontemporary and in some respects a rival of the Apostles; and who,\r\nprobably, was with St. Paul at Ephesus and Rome.[321] As far as his\r\npersonal character is concerned, there is nothing to be lamented in\r\nthese omissions. There is nothing very winning, or very commanding,\r\neither in his biographer's picture of him, or in his own letters. His\r\nvirtues, as we have already seen, were temperance and a disregard of\r\nwealth; and that he really had these, and such as these, may be safely\r\nconcluded from the fact of the popularity which he enjoyed. The great\r\nobject of his ambition seems to have been to emulate the fame of his\r\nmaster; and his efforts had their reward in the general admiration he\r\nattracted, the honours paid him by the Oracles, and the attentions shown\r\nhim by men in power.\r\n\r\nWe might have been inclined, indeed, to suspect that his reputation\r\nexisted principally in his biographer's panegyric, were it not attested\r\nby other writers. The celebrity, which he has enjoyed since the writings\r\nof the Eclectics, by itself affords but a faint presumption of his\r\nnotoriety before they appeared. Yet, after all allowances, there remains\r\nenough to show that, however fabulous the details of his history may be,\r\nthere was something extraordinary in his life and character. Some\r\nfoundation there must have been for statements which his eulogists were\r\nable to maintain in the face of those who would have spoken out had they\r\nbeen altogether novel. Pretensions never before advanced must have\r\nexcited the surprise and contempt of the advocates of Christianity.[322]\r\nYet Eusebius styles him a wise man, and seems to admit the correctness\r\nof Philostratus, except in the miraculous parts of the narrative.[323]\r\nLactantius does not deny that a statue was erected to him at\r\nEphesus;[324] and Sidonius Apollinaris, who even wrote his life, speaks\r\nof him as the admiration of the countries he traversed, and the\r\nfavourite of monarchs.[325] One of his works was deposited in the palace\r\nat Antium by the Emperor Hadrian, who also formed a collection of his\r\nletters;[326] statues were erected to him in the temples, divine honours\r\npaid him by Caracalla, Alexander Severus, and Aurelian, and magical\r\nvirtue attributed to his name.[327]\r\n\r\nIt has in consequence been made a subject of dispute, how far his\r\nreputation was built upon that supposed claim to extraordinary power\r\nwhich, as was noticed in the opening of our memoir, has led to his\r\ncomparison with Sacred Names. If it could be shown that he did advance\r\nsuch pretensions, and upon the strength of them was admitted as an\r\nobject of divine honour, a case would be made out, not indeed so strong\r\nas that on which Christianity is founded, yet remarkable enough to\r\ndemand our serious examination. Assuming, then, or overlooking this\r\nnecessary condition, sceptical writers have been forward to urge the\r\nhistory and character of Apollonius as creating a difficulty in the\r\nargument for Christianity derived from miracles; while their opponents\r\nhave sometimes attempted to account for a phenomenon of which they had\r\nnot yet ascertained the existence, and have most gratuitously ascribed\r\nhis supposed power to the influence of the Evil principle.[328] On\r\nexamination, we shall find not a shadow of a reason for supposing that\r\nApollonius worked miracles in any proper sense of the word; or that he\r\nprofessed to work them; or that he rested his authority on extraordinary\r\nworks of any kind; and it is strange indeed that Christians, with\r\nvictory in their hands, should have so mismanaged their cause as to\r\nestablish an objection where none existed, and in their haste to\r\nextricate themselves from an imaginary difficulty, to overturn one of\r\nthe main arguments for Revealed Religion.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\n1. To state these pretended prodigies is in most cases a refutation of\r\ntheir claim upon our notice,[329] and even those which are not in\r\nthemselves exceptionable become so from the circumstances or manner in\r\nwhich they took place. Apollonius is said to have been an incarnation of\r\nthe God Proteus; his birth was announced by the falling of a thunderbolt\r\nand a chorus of swans; his death signalized by a wonderful voice calling\r\nhim up to Heaven; and after death he appeared to a youth to convince him\r\nof the immortality of the soul.[330] He is reported to have known the\r\nlanguage of birds; to have evoked the spirit of Achilles; to have\r\ndislodged a demon from a boy; to have detected an Empusa who was\r\nseducing a youth into marriage; when brought before Tigellinus, to have\r\ncaused the writing of the indictment to vanish from the paper; when\r\nimprisoned by Domitian, to have miraculously released himself from his\r\nfetters; to have discovered the soul of Amasis in the body of a lion; to\r\nhave cured a youth attacked by hydrophobia, whom he pronounced to be\r\nTelephus the Mysian.[331] In declaring men's thoughts and distant\r\nevents, he indulged most liberally; adopting a brevity which seemed\r\nbecoming the dignity of his character, while it secured his prediction\r\nfrom the possibility of an entire failure. For instance: he gave\r\nprevious intimation of Nero's narrow escape from lightning; foretold the\r\nshort reigns of his successors; informed Vespasian at Alexandria of the\r\nburning of the Capitol; predicted the violent death of Titus by a\r\nrelative; discovered a knowledge of the private history of his Egyptian\r\nguide; foresaw the wreck of a ship he had embarked in, and the execution\r\nof a Cilician Proprætor.[332] His prediction of the Proprætor's ruin was\r\nconveyed in the words, \"O that particular day!\" that is, of execution;\r\nof the short reigns of the Emperors in his saying that many Thebans\r\nwould succeed Nero. We must not omit his first predicting and then\r\nremoving a pestilence at Ephesus, the best authenticated of his\r\nprofessed miracles, as being attested by the erecting of a statue to him\r\nin consequence. He is said to have put an end to the malady by\r\ncommanding an aged man to be stoned, whom he pointed out as its author,\r\nand who when the stones were removed was found changed into the shape of\r\na dog.[333]\r\n\r\nThat such marvellous occurrences are wanting either in the gravity, or\r\nin the conclusiveness, proper to true miracles, is very plain; moreover,\r\nthat they gain no recommendation from the mode in which they are\r\nrecorded will be evident, if we extract the accounts given us by\r\nPhilostratus of those two which alone among Apollonius's acts, from\r\ntheir internal character, demand our attention. These are the revival of\r\na young maid at Rome, who was on her way to burial, and the announcement\r\nat Ephesus of Domitian's assassination at the very time of its\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\nAs to the former of these, it will be seen to be an attempt, and an\r\nelaborate, pretentious attempt, to outdo certain narratives in the\r\nGospels. It runs as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"A maiden of marriageable age seemed to have died, and the\r\n     bridegroom was accompanying her bier, uttering wailing cries, as\r\n     was natural on his marriage being thus cut short. And all Rome\r\n     lamented with him, for the maiden belonged to a consular house. But\r\n     Apollonius, coming upon this sad sight, said, 'Set down the bier,\r\n     for I will stop your tears for her.' At the same time, he asked her\r\n     name; and most of those present thought he was going to make a\r\n     speech about her, after the manner of professed mourners. But he,\r\n     doing nothing else than touching her, and saying over her some\r\n     indistinct words, woke her from her seeming death. And the girl\r\n     spoke, and returned to her father's house, as Alcestis, when\r\n     restored to life by Hercules.\"[334]\r\n\r\nAs to his proclaiming at Ephesus the assassination of Domitian at the\r\ntime of its occurrence, of course, if he was at a great distance from\r\nRome and the synchronism of events could be proved, we should be bound\r\nto give it our serious consideration; but synchronisms are difficult to\r\nverify. Moreover, Apollonius is known to have taken part in the politics\r\nof the empire; and his words, if he used them, might be prompted by his\r\nknowledge, or by his furtherance, of some attempt upon Domitian's life.\r\nApollonius was at this time busily engaged in promoting Nerva's\r\ninterests among the Ionians. Dion[335] tells us that his success was\r\nforetold by the astrologers, among whom Tzetzes reckons Apollonius; and\r\nhe mentions a prediction of Domitian's death which had been put into\r\ncirculation in Germany. It is true that Dion confirms Philostratus's\r\nstatement so far as the prediction is concerned, expressing strongly his\r\npersonal belief in it. \"Apollonius,\" he says, \"ascending upon a high\r\nstone at Ephesus or elsewhere, and calling together the people, cried\r\nout, 'Well done, Stephanus!'\" He adds, \"This really took place, though a\r\nman should ever so much disbelieve it.\"[336] But it must be recollected\r\nthat Dion was writing his history when Philostratus wrote; and one of\r\nthem may have taken the account from the other; moreover, he is well\r\nknown to be of a credulous turn of mind, and far from averse from\r\nrecording marvellous stories.\r\n\r\nLet us now turn to the statement of Philostratus; it will be found to\r\nform as strong a contrast to the simplicity and dignity of the Gospel\r\nnarratives, as the dabbling in politics, which is so marked a feature in\r\nApollonius, differs from the conduct of Him who emphatically declared\r\nthat His kingdom was not of this world.\r\n\r\n     \"He was conversing,\" says Philostratus, \"among the groves attached\r\n     to the porticoes, about noon, that is, just at the time when the\r\n     event was occurring in the imperial palace; and first he dropped\r\n     his voice, as if in terror; then, with a faltering unusual to him,\r\n     he described [an action], as if he beheld something external, as\r\n     his words proceeded. Then he was silent, stopping abruptly; and\r\n     looking with agitation on the ground, and advancing up three or\r\n     four of the steps, 'Strike the tyrant, strike!' he cried out, not\r\n     as drawing a mere image of the truth from some mirror, but as\r\n     seeing the thing itself, and seeming to realize what was doing;\r\n     and, to the consternation of all Ephesus, for it was thronging\r\n     around while he was conversing, after an interval of suspense,\r\n     such as happens when spectators are following some undecided action\r\n     up to its issue, he said, 'Courage, my men, for the tyrant is\r\n     slaughtered this day--nay, now, now.'\"[337]\r\n\r\nOnly an eye-witness is warranted to write thus pictorially; Philostratus\r\nwas born 86 years after Apollonius's death.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.\r\n\r\n2. But it is almost superfluous to speak either of the general character\r\nof his extraordinary acts, or of the tone and manner in which they are\r\nnarrated, when, in truth, neither Apollonius nor his biographer had any\r\nnotion or any intention of maintaining that, in our sense of the word\r\n\"miracle,\" these acts were miracles at all, or were to be referred to\r\nthe immediate agency of the Supreme Being. Apollonius neither claimed\r\nfor himself, nor did Philostratus claim for him, any direct mission from\r\non high; nor did he in consequence submit the exercise of his\r\npreternatural powers to such severe tests as may fairly be applied to\r\nthe miracles of Christianity.\r\n\r\nOf works, indeed, which are asserted to proceed from the Author of\r\nnature, sobriety, dignity, and conclusiveness may fairly be required;\r\nbut when a man ascribes his extraordinary power to his knowledge of some\r\nmerely human secret, impropriety does but evidence his own want of\r\ntaste, and ambiguity his want of skill. We have no longer a right to\r\nexpect a great end, worthy means, or a frugal and judicious application\r\nof the miraculous gift. Now, Apollonius claimed nothing beyond a fuller\r\ninsight into nature than others had; a knowledge of the fated and\r\nimmutable laws to which it is conformed, of the hidden springs on which\r\nit moves.[338] He brought a secret from the East and used it; and though\r\nhe professed to be favoured, and in a manner taught, by good\r\nspirits,[339] yet he certainly referred no part of his power to a\r\nSupreme Intelligence. Theurgic virtues, or those which consisted in\r\ncommunion with the Powers and Principles of nature, were high in the\r\nscale of Pythagorean excellence, and to them it was that he ascribed his\r\nextraordinary gift. By temperate living, it was said, the mind was\r\nendued with ampler and more exalted faculties than it otherwise\r\npossessed; partook more fully of the nature of the One Universal Soul,\r\nwas gifted with prophetic inspiration, and a kind of intuitive\r\nperception of secret things.[340] This power, derived from the favour of\r\nthe celestial deities, who were led to distinguish the virtuous and\r\nhigh-minded, was quite distinct from magic, an infamous, uncertain, and\r\ndeceitful art, consisting in a compulsory power over infernal spirits,\r\noperating by means of Astrology, Auguries, and Sacrifices, and directed\r\nto the personal emolument of those who cultivated it.[341] To our\r\npresent question, however, this distinction made by the genuine\r\nPythagorean, is unimportant. To whichever principle the miracles of\r\nApollonius be referred, theurgy or magic, in either case they are\r\nindependent of the First Cause, and not granted with a view to the\r\nparticular purpose to which they are to be applied.[342]\r\n\r\n3. We have also incidentally shown that they did not profess to be\r\nmiracles in the proper meaning of the word, that is, evident innovations\r\non the laws of nature. At the utmost they do but exemplify the aphorism,\r\n\"Knowledge is power.\"[343] Such as are within the range of human\r\nknowledge are no miracles. Those of them, on the contrary, which are\r\nbeyond it, will be found on inspection to be unintelligible, and to\r\nconvey no evidence. The prediction of an earthquake (for instance) is\r\nnot necessarily superhuman. An interpretation of the discourse of birds\r\ncan never be verified. In understanding languages, knowing future\r\nevents, discovering the purposes of others, recognising human souls when\r\nenclosed in new bodies, Apollonius merely professes extreme penetration\r\nand extraordinary acquaintance with nature. The spell by which he evokes\r\nspirits and exorcises demons, implies the mere possession of a\r\nsecret;[344] and so perfectly is his biographer aware of this, as almost\r\nto doubt the resuscitation of the Roman damsel, the only decisive\r\nmiracle of them all, on the ground of its being supernatural,\r\ninsinuating that perhaps she was dead only in appearance.[345]\r\nAccordingly, in the narrative which we have extracted above, he begins\r\nby saying that she \"seemed to have died,\" or \"was to all appearance\r\ndead;\" and again at the end of it he speaks of her \"seeming death.\"\r\nHence, moreover, may be understood the meaning of the charge of magic,\r\nas brought against the early Christians by their heathen adversaries;\r\nthe miracles of the Gospels being strictly interruptions of physical\r\norder, and incompatible with theurgic knowledge.[346]\r\n\r\nWhen our Lord and His Apostles declare themselves to be sent from God,\r\nthis claim to a divine mission illustrates and gives dignity to their\r\nprofession of extraordinary power; whereas the divinity,[347] no less\r\nthan the gift of miracles to which Apollonius laid claim, must be\r\nunderstood in its Pythagorean sense, as referring not to any intimate\r\nconnection with a Supreme Agent, but to his partaking, through his\r\ntheurgic skill, more largely than others in the perfections of the\r\nanimating principle of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.\r\n\r\n4. Yet, whatever is understood by his miraculous gift and his divine\r\nnature, certainly his works were not adduced as vouchers for his\r\ndivinity, nor were they, in fact, the principal cause of his reputation.\r\nWhat we desiderate is a contemporary appeal to them, on the part of\r\nhimself or his friends; as St. Paul speaks of his miracles to the Romans\r\nand Corinthians, even calling them in one place \"the signs of an\r\nApostle;\" or as St. Luke, in the Acts of the Apostles, details the\r\nmiracles of both St. Peter and St. Paul.[348] Far different is it with\r\nApollonius: we meet with no claim to extraordinary power in his Letters;\r\nnor when returning thanks to a city for public honours bestowed on him,\r\nnor when complaining to his brother of the neglect of his townsmen, nor\r\nwhen writing to his opponent Euphrates.[349] To the Milesians, indeed,\r\nhe speaks of earthquakes which he had predicted; but without appealing\r\nto the prediction in proof of his authority.[350] Since, then, he is so\r\nfar from insisting on his pretended extraordinary powers, and himself\r\nconnects the acquisition of them with his Eastern expedition,[351] we\r\nmay conclude that credit for possessing magical secrets was a _part_ of\r\nthe reputation which that expedition conferred. A foreign appearance,\r\nsingularity of manners, a life of travel, and pretences to superior\r\nknowledge, excite the imagination of beholders;[352] and, as in the case\r\nof a wandering people among ourselves, appear to invite the persons who\r\nare thus distinguished, to fraudulent practices. Apollonius is\r\nrepresented as making converts as soon as seen.[353] It was not, then\r\nhis display of marvels, but his Pythagorean dress and mysterious\r\ndeportment, which arrested attention, and made him thought superior to\r\nother men, because he was different from them. Like Lucian's\r\nAlexander[354] (who was all but his disciple), he was skilled in\r\nmedicine, professed to be favoured by Æsculapius, pretended to\r\nforeknowledge, was in collusion with the heathen priests, and was\r\nsupported by the Oracles; and being more strict in conduct than the\r\nPaphlagonian,[355] he established a more lasting celebrity. His\r\nusefulness to political aspirants contributed to his success; perhaps\r\nalso the real and contemporary miracles of the Christian teachers would\r\ndispose many minds easily to acquiesce in any claims of a similar\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n\r\n7.\r\n\r\n5. In the foregoing remarks we have admitted, the general fidelity of\r\nthe history, because ancient authors allow it, and there was no\r\nnecessity to dispute it. Tried however on his own merits, it is quite\r\nunworthy of serious attention. Not only in the miraculous accounts (as\r\nwe have already seen), but in the relation of a multitude of ordinary\r\nfacts, an effort to rival our Saviour's history is distinctly visible.\r\nThe favour in which Apollonius from a child was held by gods and men;\r\nhis conversations when a youth in the Temple of Æsculapius; his\r\ndetermination in spite of danger to go up to Rome;[356] the cowardice\r\nof his disciples in deserting him; the charge brought against him of\r\ndisaffection to Cæsar; the Minister's acknowledging, on his private\r\nexamination, that he was more than man; the ignominious treatment of him\r\nby Domitian on his second appearance at Rome; his imprisonment with\r\ncriminals; his vanishing from Court and sudden reappearance to his\r\nmourning disciples at Puteoli;[357]--these, with other particulars of a\r\nsimilar cast, evidence a history modelled after the narrative of the\r\nEvangelists. Expressions, moreover, and descriptions occur, clearly\r\nimitated from the sacred volume. To this we must add[358] the rhetorical\r\ncolouring of the whole composition, so contrary to the sobriety of\r\ntruth;[359] the fabulous accounts of things and places interspersed\r\nthrough the history;[360] lastly, we must bear in mind the principle,\r\nrecognised by the Pythagorean and Eclectic schools, of permitting\r\nexaggeration and deceit in the cause of philosophy.[361]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter all, it must be remembered, that were the pretended miracles as\r\nunexceptionable as we have shown them to be absurd and useless--were\r\nthey plain interruptions of established laws--were they grave and\r\ndignified in their nature, and important in their object, and were there\r\nnothing to excite suspicion in the design, manner, or character of the\r\nnarrator--still the testimony on which they rest is the bare word of an\r\nauthor writing one hundred years after the death of the person\r\npanegyrized, and far distant from the places in which most of the\r\nmiracles were wrought, and who can give no better account of his\r\ninformation than that he gained it from an unpublished work,[362]\r\nprofessedly indeed composed by a witness of the extraordinary\r\ntransactions, but passing into his hands through two intermediate\r\npossessors. These are circumstances which almost, without positive\r\nobjections, are sufficient by their own negative force to justify a\r\nsummary rejection of the whole account. Unless, indeed, the history had\r\nbeen perverted to a mischievous purpose, we should esteem it impertinent\r\nto direct argument against a mere romance, and to subject a work of\r\nimagination to a grave discussion.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[274] Olear. ad Philostr. i. 12.\r\n\r\n[275] By Lord Herbert and Mr. Blount.\r\n\r\n[276] Philostr. i. 3.\r\n\r\n[277] Philostr. i. 2, 3.\r\n\r\n[278] His work was called [Greek: Logoi Philalêtheis pros Christianous]'\r\non this subject see Mosheim, _Dissertat. de turbatâ per recentiores\r\nPlatonicos Ecclesiâ_, Sec. 25.\r\n\r\n[279] Philostr i. 17, vi. 11.\r\n\r\n[280] Philostr. i. 7.\r\n\r\n[281] Ibid. i. 8.\r\n\r\n[282] Ibid. i. 13.\r\n\r\n[283] Ibid. i. 14, 15.\r\n\r\n[284] Brucker, vol. ii. p. 104.\r\n\r\n[285] Philostr. i. 16.\r\n\r\n[286] See Olear. _præfat. ad vitam._ As he died, U.C. 849, he is usually\r\nconsidered to have lived to a hundred.

AMBROSE SAY ABOUT IT?\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1. _Ambrose and Justina._\r\n\r\nNo considerate person will deny that there is much in the spirit of the\r\ntimes, and in the actual changes which the British Constitution has\r\nlately undergone, which makes it probable, or not improbable, that a\r\nmaterial alteration will soon take place in the relations of the Church\r\ntowards the State, to which it has been hitherto united. I do not say\r\nthat it is out of the question that things may return to their former\r\nquiet and pleasant course, as in the good old time of King George III.;\r\nbut the very chance that they will not makes it a practical concern for\r\nevery churchman to prepare himself for a change, and a practical\r\nquestion for the clergy, by what instruments the authority of Religion\r\nis to be supported, should the protection and patronage of the\r\nGovernment be withdrawn. Truth, indeed, will always support itself in\r\nthe world by its native vigour; it will never die while heaven and earth\r\nlast, but be handed down from saint to saint until the end of all\r\nthings. But this was the case before our Lord came, and is still the\r\ncase, as we may humbly trust, in heathen countries. My question concerns\r\n_the Church_, that peculiar institution which Christ set up as a\r\nvisible home and memorial of Truth; and which, as being in this world,\r\nmust be manifested by means of this world. I know it is common to make\r\nlight of this solicitude about the Church, under the notion that the\r\nGospel may be propagated without it,--or that men are about the same\r\nunder every Dispensation, their hearts being in fault, and not their\r\ncircumstances,--or for other reasons, better or worse as it may be; to\r\nall which I am accustomed to answer (and I do not see how I can be in\r\nerror), that, if Christ had not meant His Church to answer a purpose, He\r\nwould not have set it up, and that our business is not to speculate\r\nabout possible Dispensations of Religion, but to resign and devote\r\nourselves to that in which we are actually placed.\r\n\r\nHitherto the English Church has depended on the State, _i. e._ on the\r\nruling powers in the country--the king and the aristocracy; and this is\r\nso natural and religious a position of things when viewed in the\r\nabstract, and in its actual working has been productive of such\r\nexcellent fruits in the Church, such quietness, such sobriety, such\r\nexternal propriety of conduct, and such freedom from doctrinal excesses,\r\nthat we must ever look back upon the period of ecclesiastical history so\r\ncharacterized with affectionate thoughts; particularly on the reigns of\r\nour blessed martyr St. Charles, and King George the Good. But these\r\nrecollections of the past must not engross our minds, or hinder us from\r\nlooking at things as they are, and as they will be soon, and from\r\ninquiring what is intended by Providence to take the place of the\r\ntime-honoured instrument, which He has broken (if it be yet broken), the\r\nregal and aristocratical power. I shall offend many men when I say, we\r\nmust _look to the people_; but let them give me a hearing.\r\n\r\nWell can I understand their feelings. Who at first sight does not\r\ndislike the thoughts of gentlemen and clergymen depending for their\r\nmaintenance and their reputation on their flocks? of their strength, as\r\na visible power, lying not in their birth, the patronage of the great,\r\nand the endowment of the Church (as hitherto), but in the homage of a\r\nmultitude? I confess I have before now had a great repugnance to the\r\nnotion myself; and if I have overcome it, and turned from the Government\r\nto the People, it has been simply because I was forced to do so. It is\r\nnot we who desert the Government, but the Government that has left us;\r\nwe are forced back upon those below us, because those above us will not\r\nhonour us; there is no help for it, I say. But, in truth, the prospect\r\nis not so bad as it seems at first sight. The chief and obvious\r\nobjection to the clergy being thrown on the People, lies in the probable\r\nlowering of Christian views, and the adulation of the vulgar, which\r\nwould be its consequence; and the state of Dissenters is appealed to as\r\nan evidence of the danger. But let us recollect that we are an\r\napostolical body; we were not made, nor can be unmade by our flocks; and\r\nif our influence is to depend on _them_, yet the Sacraments reside with\r\n_us_. We have that with us, which none but ourselves possess, the mantle\r\nof the Apostles; and this, properly understood and cherished, will ever\r\nkeep us from being the creatures of a populace.\r\n\r\nAnd what may become necessary in time to come, is a more religious state\r\nof things also. It will not be denied that, according to the Scripture\r\nview of the Church, though all are admitted into her pale, and the rich\r\ninclusively, yet, the poor are her members with a peculiar suitableness,\r\nand by a special right. Scripture is ever casting slurs upon wealth, and\r\nmaking much of poverty. \"To the poor the Gospel is preached.\" \"God hath\r\nchosen the poor of this world, rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom.\"\r\n\"If thou wilt be perfect, sell all that thou hast, and give to the\r\npoor.\" To this must be added the undeniable fact that the Church, when\r\npurest and when most powerful, _has_ depended for its influence on its\r\nconsideration with the many. Becket's letters, lately published,[363]\r\nhave struck me not a little; but of course I now refer, not to such dark\r\nages as most Englishmen consider these, but to the primitive Church--the\r\nChurch of St. Athanasius and St. Ambrose. With a view of showing the\r\npower of the Church at that time, and on what it was based, not (as\r\nProtestants imagine) on governments, or on human law, or on endowments,\r\nbut on popular enthusiasm, on dogma, on hierarchical power, and on a\r\nsupernatural Divine Presence, I will now give some account of certain\r\necclesiastical proceedings in the city of Milan in the years 385,\r\n386,--Ambrose being bishop, and Justina and her son, the younger\r\nValentinian, the reigning powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\nAmbrose was eminently a popular bishop, as every one knows who has read\r\never so little of his history. His very promotion to the sacred office\r\nwas owing to an unexpected movement of the populace. Auxentius, his\r\nArian predecessor in the see of Milan, died, A.D. 374, upon which the\r\nbishops of the province wrote to the then Emperor, Valentinian the\r\nFirst, who was in Gaul, requesting him to name the person who was to\r\nsucceed him. This was a prudent step on their part, Arianism having\r\nintroduced such matter for discord and faction among the Milanese, that\r\nit was dangerous to submit the election to the people at large, though\r\nthe majority of them were orthodox. Valentinian, however, declined to\r\navail himself of the permission thus given him; the choice was thrown\r\nupon the voices of the people, and the cathedral, which was the place of\r\nassembling, was soon a scene of disgraceful uproar, as the bishops had\r\nanticipated. Ambrose was at that time civil governor of the province of\r\nwhich Milan was the capital: and, the tumult increasing, he was obliged\r\nto interfere in person, with a view of preventing its ending in open\r\nsedition. He was a man of grave character, and had been in youth brought\r\nup with a sister, who had devoted herself to the service of God in a\r\nsingle life; but as yet was only a catechumen, though he was half way\r\nbetween thirty and forty. Arrived at the scene of tumult, he addressed\r\nthe assembled crowds, exhorting them to peace and order. While he was\r\nspeaking, a child's voice, as is reported, was heard in the midst of the\r\ncrowd to say, \"Ambrose is bishop;\" the populace took up the cry, and\r\nboth parties in the Church, Catholic and Arian, whether influenced by a\r\nsudden enthusiasm, or willing to take a man who was unconnected with\r\nparty, voted unanimously for the election of Ambrose.\r\n\r\nIt is not wonderful that the subject of this sudden decision should have\r\nbeen unwilling to quit his civil office for a station of such high\r\nresponsibility; for many days he fought against the popular voice, and\r\nthat by the most extravagant expedients. He absconded, and was not\r\nrecovered till the Emperor, confirming the act of the people of Milan,\r\npublished an edict against all who should conceal him. Under these\r\nstrange circumstances, Ambrose was at length consecrated bishop. His\r\nordination was canonical only on the supposition that it came under\r\nthose rare exceptions, for which the rules of the Church allow, when\r\nthey speak of election \"by divine grace,\" by the immediate suggestion of\r\nGod; and if ever a bishop's character and works might be appealed to as\r\nevidence of the divine purpose, surely Ambrose was the subject of that\r\nsingular and extraordinary favour. From the time of his call he devoted\r\nhis life and abilities to the service of Christ. He bestowed his\r\npersonal property on the poor: his lands on the Church; making his\r\nsister tenant for life. Next he gave himself up to the peculiar studies\r\nnecessary for the due execution of his high duties, till he gained that\r\ndeep insight into Catholic truth, which is evidenced in his writings,\r\nand in no common measure in relation to Arianism, which had been the\r\ndominant creed in Milan for the twenty years preceding his elevation.\r\nBasil of Cæsarea, in Cappadocia, was at this time the main pillar of\r\nCatholic truth in the East, having succeeded Athanasius of Alexandria,\r\nwho died about the time that both Basil and Ambrose were advanced to\r\ntheir respective sees. He, from his see in the far East, addresses the\r\nnew bishop in these words in an extant Epistle:--\r\n\r\n     \"Proceed in thy work, thou man of God; and since thou hast not\r\n     received the Gospel of Christ of men, neither wast taught it, but\r\n     the Lord himself translated thee from among the world's judges to\r\n     the chair of the Apostles, fight the good fight, set right the\r\n     infirmities of the people, wherever the Arian madness has affected\r\n     them; renew the old foot-prints of the Fathers, and by frequent\r\n     correspondence build up thy love towards us, of which thou hast\r\n     already laid the foundation.\"--_Ep._ 197.\r\n\r\nI just now mentioned St. Thomas Becket. There is at once a similarity\r\nand a contrast between his history and that of Ambrose. Each of the two\r\nwas by education and society what would now be called a gentleman. Each\r\nwas in high civil station when he was raised to a great ecclesiastical\r\nposition; each was in middle age. Each had led an upright, virtuous life\r\nbefore his elevation; and each, on being elevated, changed it for a life\r\nof extraordinary penance and saintly devotion. Each was promoted to his\r\nhigh place by the act, direct or concurrent, of his sovereign; and each\r\nshowed to that sovereign in the most emphatic way that a bishop was the\r\nservant, not of man, but of the Lord of heaven and earth. Each boldly\r\nconfronted his sovereign in a great religious quarrel, and staked his\r\nlife on its issue;--but then comes the contrast, for Becket's earthly\r\nmaster was as resolute in his opposition to the Church as Becket was in\r\nits behalf, and made him a martyr; whereas the Imperial Power of Rome\r\nquailed and gave way before the dauntless bearing and the grave and\r\ngracious presence of the great prelate of Milan. Indeed, the whole\r\nPontificate of Ambrose is a history of successive victories of the\r\nChurch over the State; but I shall limit myself to a bare outline of one\r\nof them.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\nAmbrose had presided in his see about eleven years at the time when the\r\nevents took place which are here to be related. Valentinian was dead, as\r\nwell as his eldest son Gratian. His second son, who bore his own name,\r\nwas Emperor of the West, under the tutelage of Justina, his second wife.\r\n\r\nJustina was an Arian, and brought up her son in her own heretical views.\r\nThis was about the time when the heresy was finally subdued in the\r\nEastern Churches; the Ecumenical Council of Constantinople had lately\r\nbeen held, many Arian bishops had conformed, and laws had been passed by\r\nTheodosius against those who held out. It was natural under such\r\ncircumstances that a number of the latter should flock to the court of\r\nMilan for protection and patronage. The Gothic officers of the palace\r\nwere Arians also, as might be supposed, after the creed of their nation.\r\nAt length they obtained a bishop of their persuasion from the East; and\r\nhaving now the form of an ecclesiastical body, they used the influence\r\nof Valentinian, or rather of his mother, to extort from Ambrose one of\r\nthe churches of Milan for their worship.\r\n\r\nThe bishop was summoned to the palace before the assembled Court, and\r\nwas formally asked to relinquish St. Victor's Church, then called the\r\nPortian Basilica, which was without the walls, for the Arian worship.\r\nHis duty was plain; the churches were the property of Christ; he was the\r\nrepresentative of Christ, and was therefore bound not to cede what was\r\ncommitted to him in trust. This is the account of the matter given by\r\nhimself in the course of the dispute:--\r\n\r\n     \"Do not,\" he says, \"O Emperor, embarrass yourself with the thought\r\n     that you have an Emperor's right over sacred things. Exalt not\r\n     yourself, but, as you would enjoy a continuance of power, be God's\r\n     subject. It is written, God's to God, and Cæsar's to Cæsar. The\r\n     palace is the Emperor's, the churches are the bishop's.\"--_Ep._ 20.\r\n\r\nThis argument, which is true at all times, was much more convincing in\r\nan age like the primitive, before men had begun to deny that Christ had\r\nleft a visible representative of Himself in His Church. If there was a\r\nbody to whom the concerns of religion were intrusted, there could be no\r\ndoubt it was that over which Ambrose presided. It had been there planted\r\never since Milan became Christian, its ministers were descended from the\r\nApostles, and it was the legitimate trustee of the sacred property. But\r\nin our day men have been taught to doubt whether there _is_ one\r\nApostolic Church, though it is mentioned in the Creed: nay, it is\r\ngrievous to say, clergymen have sometimes forgotten, sometimes made\r\nlight of their own privileges. Accordingly, when a question arises now\r\nabout the spoliation of the Church, we are obliged to betake ourselves\r\nto the rules of _national_ law; we appeal to precedents, or we urge the\r\ncivil consequences of the measure, or we use other arguments, which,\r\ngood as they may be, are too refined to be very popular. Ambrose rested\r\nhis resistance on grounds which the people understood at once, and\r\nrecognized as irrefragable. They felt that he was only refusing to\r\nsurrender a trust. They rose in a body, and thronged the palace gates. A\r\ncompany of soldiers was sent to disperse them; and a riot was on the\r\npoint of ensuing, when the ministers of the Court became alarmed, and\r\ndespatched Ambrose to appease the tumult, with the pledge that no\r\nfurther attempt should be made on the possessions of the Church.\r\n\r\nNow some reader will here interrupt the narrative, perhaps, with\r\nsomething of an indignant burst about connecting the cause of religion\r\nwith mobs and outbreaks. To whom I would reply, that the multitude of\r\nmen is always rude and intemperate, and needs restraint,--religion does\r\nnot make them so. But being so, it is better they should be zealous\r\nabout religion, and repressed by religion, as in this case, than flow\r\nand ebb again under the irrational influences of this world. A mob,\r\nindeed, is always wayward and faithless; but it is a good sign when it\r\nis susceptible of the hopes and fears of the world to come. Is it not\r\nprobable that, when religion is thus a popular subject, it may\r\npenetrate, soften, or stimulate hearts which otherwise would know\r\nnothing of its power? However, this is not, properly speaking, my\r\npresent point, which is to show how a Church may be in \"favour with all\r\nthe people\" without any subserviency to them. To return to our history.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\nJustina, failing to intimidate, made various underhand attempts to\r\nremove the champion of orthodoxy. She endeavoured to raise the people\r\nagainst him. Failing in this object, next, by scattering promises of\r\nplace and promotion, she set on foot various projects to seize him in\r\nchurch, and carry him off into banishment. One man went so far as to\r\ntake lodgings near the church, and had a carriage in readiness, in order\r\nto avail himself of any opportunity which offered to convey him away.\r\nBut none of these attempts succeeded.\r\n\r\nThis was in the month of March; as Easter drew on, more vigorous steps\r\nwere taken by the Court. On April 4th, the Friday before Palm Sunday,\r\nthe demand of a church for the Arians was renewed; the pledges which the\r\ngovernment had given, that no further steps should be taken in the\r\nmatter, being perhaps evaded by changing the church which was demanded.\r\nAmbrose was now asked for the New or Roman Basilica, which was within\r\nthe walls, and larger than the Portian. It was dedicated to the\r\nApostles, and (I may add, for the sake of the antiquarian,) was built in\r\nthe form of a cross. When the bishop refused in the same language as\r\nbefore, the imperial minister returned to the demand of the Portian\r\nChurch; but the people interfering, and being clamorous against the\r\nproposal, he was obliged to retire to the palace to report how matters\r\nstood.\r\n\r\nOn Palm Sunday, after the lessons and sermon were over in the Basilica,\r\nin which he officiated, Ambrose was engaged in teaching the creed to\r\nthe candidates for baptism, who, as was customary, had been catechized\r\nduring Lent, and were to be admitted into the Church on the night before\r\nEaster-day. News was brought him that the officers of the Court had\r\ntaken possession of the Portian Church, and were arranging the imperial\r\nhangings in token of its being confiscated to the Emperor; on the other\r\nhand, that the people were flocking thither. Ambrose continued the\r\nservice of the day; but, when he was in the midst of the celebration of\r\nthe Eucharistical rite, a second message came that one of the Arian\r\npriests was in the hands of the populace.\r\n\r\n     \"On this news (he says, writing to his sister,) I could not keep\r\n     from shedding many bitter tears, and, while I made oblation, I\r\n     prayed God's protection that no blood might be shed in the Church's\r\n     quarrel: or if so, that it might be mine, and that not for my\r\n     people only, but for those heretics.\"--_Ep._ 20.\r\n\r\nAt the same time he despatched some of his clergy to the spot, who had\r\ninfluence enough to rescue the unfortunate man from the mob.\r\n\r\nThough Ambrose so far seems to have been supported only by a popular\r\nmovement, yet the proceedings of the following week showed that he had\r\nalso the great mass of respectable citizens on his side. The imprudent\r\nmeasures of the Court, in punishing those whom it considered its\r\nenemies, disclosed to the world their number and importance. The\r\ntradesmen of the city were fined two hundred pounds of gold, and many\r\nwere thrown into prison. All the officers, moreover, and place-men of\r\nthe courts of justice, were ordered to keep in-doors during the\r\ncontinuance of the disorders; and men of higher rank were menaced with\r\nsevere consequences, unless the Basilica were surrendered.\r\n\r\nSuch were the acts by which the Imperial Court solemnized Passion week.\r\nAt length a fresh interview was sought with Ambrose, which shall be\r\ndescribed in his own words:--\r\n\r\n     \"I had a meeting with the counts and tribunes, who urged me to give\r\n     up the Basilica without delay, on the ground that the Emperor was\r\n     but acting on his undoubted rights, as possessing sovereign power\r\n     over all things. I made answer, that if he asked me for what was my\r\n     own--for instance, my estate, my money, or the like--I would make\r\n     no opposition: though, to tell the truth, all that was mine was the\r\n     property of the poor; but that he had no sovereignty over things\r\n     sacred. If my patrimony is demanded, seize upon it; my person, here\r\n     I am. Would you take to prison or to death? I go with pleasure. Far\r\n     be it from me to entrench myself within the circle of a multitude,\r\n     or to clasp the altar in supplication for my life; rather I will be\r\n     a sacrifice for the altar's sake.\r\n\r\n     \"In good truth, when I heard that soldiers were sent to take\r\n     possession of the Basilica, I was horrified at the prospect of\r\n     bloodshed, which might issue in ruin to the whole city. I prayed\r\n     God that I might not survive the destruction, which might ensue, of\r\n     such a place, nay, of Italy itself. I shrank from the odium of\r\n     having occasioned slaughter, and would sooner have given my own\r\n     throat to the knife.... I was ordered to calm the people. I\r\n     replied, that all I could do was not to inflame them; but God alone\r\n     could appease them. For myself, if I appeared to have instigated\r\n     them, it was the duty of the government to proceed against me, or\r\n     to banish me. Upon this they left me.\"\r\n\r\nAmbrose spent the rest of Palm Sunday in the same Basilica in which he\r\nhad been officiating in the morning: at night he went to his own house,\r\nthat the civil power might have the opportunity of arresting him, if it\r\nwas thought advisable.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to gain the Portian seems now to have been dropped; but on\r\nthe Wednesday troops were marched before day-break to take possession\r\nof the New Church, which was within the walls. Ambrose, upon the news of\r\nthis fresh movement, used the weapons of an apostle. He did not seek to\r\ndisturb them in their possession; but, attending service at his own\r\nchurch, he was content with threatening the soldiers with a sentence of\r\nexcommunication. Meanwhile the New Church, where the soldiers were\r\nposted, began to fill with a larger congregation than it ever contained\r\nbefore the persecution. Ambrose was requested to go thither, but,\r\ndesirous of drawing the people away from the scene of imperial tyranny,\r\nlest a riot should ensue, he remained where he was, and began a comment\r\non the lesson of the day, which was from the book of Job. First, he\r\ncommended them for the Christian patience and resignation with which\r\nthey had hitherto borne their trial, which indeed was, on the whole,\r\nsurprising, if we consider the inflammable nature of a multitude. \"We\r\npetition your Majesty,\" they said to the Emperor; \"we use no force, we\r\nfeel no fear, but we petition.\" It is common in the leader of a\r\nmultitude to profess peaceableness, but very unusual for the multitude\r\nitself to persevere in doing so. Ambrose went on to observe, that both\r\nthey and he had in their way been tempted, as Job was, by the powers of\r\nevil. For himself, his peculiar trial had lain in the reflection that\r\nthe extraordinary measures of the government, the movements of the\r\nGothic guards, the fines of the tradesmen, the various sufferings of the\r\nfaithful, all arose from, as it might be called, his obstinacy in not\r\nyielding to what seemed an overwhelming necessity, and giving the\r\nBasilica to the Arians. Yet he felt that to do so would be to peril his\r\nsoul; so that the request was but the voice of the tempter, as he spoke\r\nin Job's wife, to make him \"say a word against God, and die,\" to betray\r\nhis trust, and incur the sentence of spiritual death.\r\n\r\nBefore this time the soldiers who had been sent to the New Church, from\r\ndread of the threat of excommunication, had declared against the\r\nsacrilege, and joined his own congregation; and now the news came that\r\nthe royal hangings had been taken down. Soon after, as he was continuing\r\nhis address to the people, a fresh message came to him from the Court to\r\nask him whether he had an intention of domineering over his sovereign?\r\nAmbrose, in answer, showed the pains he had taken to be obedient to the\r\nEmperor's will, and to hinder disturbance: then he added:--\r\n\r\n     \"Priests have by old right bestowed sovereignty, never assumed it;\r\n     and it is a common saying, that sovereigns have coveted the\r\n     priesthood more than priests the sovereignty. Christ hid Himself,\r\n     lest He should be made a king. Yes! we have a dominion of our own.\r\n     The dominion of the priest lies in his helplessness, as it is said,\r\n     'When I am weak, then am I strong.'\"\r\n\r\nAnd so ended the dispute for a time. On Good Friday the Court gave way;\r\nthe guards were ordered from the Basilica, and the fines were remitted.\r\nI end for the present with the view which Ambrose took of the prospect\r\nbefore him:--\r\n\r\n     \"Thus the matter rests; I wish I could say, has ended: but the\r\n     Emperor's words are of that angry sort which shows that a more\r\n     severe contest is in store. He says I domineer, or worse than\r\n     domineer. He implied this when his ministers were entreating him,\r\n     on the petition of the soldiers, to attend church. 'Should Ambrose\r\n     bid you,' he made answer, 'doubtless you would give me to him in\r\n     chains.' I leave you to judge what these words promise. Persons\r\n     present were all shocked at hearing them; but there are parties who\r\n     exasperate him.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[363] Vid. _British Magazine_, 1832, etc. And Froude's Remains, part II,\r\nvol. ii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2. _Ambrose and Valentinian._\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\nIn the opposition which Ambrose made to the Arians, as already related,\r\nthere is no appearance of his appealing to any law of the Empire in\r\njustification of his refusal to surrender the Basilica to them. He\r\nrested it upon the simple basis of the Divine Law, a commonsense\r\nargument which there was no evading. \"The Basilica has been made over to\r\nChrist; the Church is His trustee; I am its ruler. I dare not alienate\r\nthe Lord's property. He who does so, does it at his peril.\" Indeed, he\r\nelsewhere expressly repudiates the principle of dependence in this\r\nmatter on human law. \"Law,\" he says, \"has not brought the Church\r\ntogether, but the faith of Christ.\" However, Justina determined to have\r\nhuman law on her side. She persuaded her son to make it a capital\r\noffence in any one, either publicly or privately, even by petition, to\r\ninterfere with the assemblies of the Arians; a provision which admitted\r\na fair, and might also bear, and did in fact receive, a most tyrannical\r\ninterpretation. Benevolus, the Secretary of State, from whose office the\r\nedict was to proceed, refused to draw it up, and resigned his place; but\r\nof course others less scrupulous were easily found to succeed him. At\r\nlength it was promulgated on the 21st of January of the next year, A.D.\r\n386, and a fresh attempt soon followed on the part of the Court to get\r\npossession of the Portian Basilica, which was without the walls.\r\n\r\nThe line of conduct which Ambrose had adopted remained equally clear\r\nand straight, whether before or after the promulgation of this edict. It\r\nwas his duty to use all the means which Christ has given the Church to\r\nprevent the profanation of the Basilica. But soon a new question arose\r\nfor his determination. An imperial message was brought to him to retire\r\nfrom the city at once, with any friends who chose to attend him. It is\r\nnot certain whether this was intended as an absolute command, or (as his\r\nwords rather imply) a recommendation on the part of government to save\r\nthemselves the odium, and him the suffering, of public and more severe\r\nproceedings. Even if it were the former, it does not appear that a\r\nChristian bishop, so circumstanced, need obey it; for what was it but in\r\nother words to say, \"Depart from the Basilica, and leave it to us?\"--the\r\nvery order which he had already withstood. The words of Scripture, which\r\nbid Christians, if persecuted in one city, flee to another, are\r\nevidently, from the form of them, a discretionary rule, grounded on the\r\nexpediency of each occasion, as it arises. A mere threat is not a\r\npersecution, nor is a command; and though we are bound to obey our civil\r\nrulers, the welfare of the Church has a prior claim upon our obedience.\r\nOther bishops took the same view of the case with Ambrose; and,\r\naccordingly, he determined to stay in Milan till removed by main force,\r\nor cut off by violence.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\nThe reader shall hear his own words in a sermon which he delivered upon\r\nthe occasion:--\r\n\r\n     \"I see that you are under a sudden and unusual excitement,\" he\r\n     said, \"and are turning your eyes on me. What can be the reason of\r\n     this? Is it that you saw or heard that an imperial message had been\r\n     brought to me by the tribunes desiring me to depart hence whither I\r\n     would, and to take with me all who would follow me? What! did you\r\n     fear that I would desert the Church, and, for fear of my life,\r\n     abandon you? Yet you might have attended to my answer. I said that\r\n     I could not, for an instant, entertain the thought of deserting the\r\n     Church, in that I feared the Lord of all more than the Emperor of\r\n     the day: in truth that, should force hurry me off, it would be my\r\n     body, not my mind, that was got rid of; that, should he act in the\r\n     way of kingly power, I was prepared to suffer after the manner of a\r\n     priest.\r\n\r\n     \"Why, then, are you thus disturbed? I will never leave you of my\r\n     own will; but if compelled, I may not resist. I shall still have\r\n     the power of sorrowing, of weeping, of uttering laments: when\r\n     weapons, soldiers, Goths, too, assail me, tears are my weapons, for\r\n     such are the defences of a priest. In any other way I neither ought\r\n     to resist, nor can; but as to retiring and deserting the Church,\r\n     this is not like me; and for this reason, lest I seem to do so from\r\n     dread of some heavier punishment. Ye yourselves know that it is my\r\n     wont to submit to our rulers, but not to make concessions to them;\r\n     to present myself readily to legal punishment, and not to fear what\r\n     is in preparation.\r\n\r\n     \"A proposal was made to me to deliver up at once the Church plate.\r\n     I made answer, that I was ready to give anything that was my own,\r\n     farm or house, gold or silver; but that I could withdraw no\r\n     property from God's temple, nor surrender what was put into my\r\n     hands, not to surrender, but to keep safely. Besides, that I had a\r\n     care for the Emperor's well-being; since it was as little safe for\r\n     him to receive as for me to surrender: let him bear with the words\r\n     of a free-spoken priest, for his own good, and shrink from doing\r\n     wrong to his Lord.\r\n\r\n     \"You recollect to-day's lesson about holy Naboth and his vineyard.\r\n     The king asked him to make it over to him, as a ground, not for\r\n     vines, but for common pot-herbs. What was his answer? 'God forbid I\r\n     should give to thee the inheritance of my fathers!' The king was\r\n     saddened when another's property was justly denied him; but he was\r\n     beguiled by a woman's counsel. Naboth shed his blood rather than\r\n     give up his vines. Shall he refuse his own vineyard, and we\r\n     surrender the Church of Christ?\r\n\r\n     \"What contumacy, then, was there in my answer? I did but say at the\r\n     interview, 'God forbid I should surrender Christ's heritage!' I\r\n     added, 'the heritage of our fathers;' yes, of our Dionysius, who\r\n     died in exile for the faith's sake, of Eustorgius the Confessor, of\r\n     Myrocles, and of all the other faithful bishops back. I answered\r\n     as a priest: let the Emperor act as an Emperor; he shall rob me of\r\n     my life sooner than of my fidelity.\r\n\r\n     \"In what respect was my answer other than respectful? Does the\r\n     Emperor wish to tax us? I make no opposition. The Church lands pay\r\n     taxes. Does he require our lands? He has power to claim them; we\r\n     will not prevent him. The contributions of the people will suffice\r\n     for the poor. Let not our enemies take offence at our lands; they\r\n     may away with them, if it please the Emperor; not that I give them,\r\n     but I make no opposition. Do they seek my gold? I can truly say,\r\n     silver and gold I seek not. But they take offence at my raising\r\n     contributions. Nor have I any great fear of the charge. I confess I\r\n     have stipendiaries; they are the poor of Christ's flock; a treasure\r\n     which I am well used in amassing. May this at all times be my\r\n     offence, to exact contributions for the poor. And if they accuse me\r\n     of defending myself by means of them, I am far from denying, I\r\n     court the charge. The poor _are_ my defenders, but it is by their\r\n     prayers. Blind though they be, lame, feeble, and aged, yet they\r\n     have a strength greater than that of the stoutest warriors. In a\r\n     word, gifts made to them are a claim upon the Lord; as it is\r\n     written, 'He who giveth to the poor, lendeth to God;' but a\r\n     military guard oftentimes has no title to divine grace.\r\n\r\n     \"They say, too, that the people are misled by the verses of my\r\n     hymns. I frankly confess this also. Truly those hymns have in them\r\n     a high strain above all other influence. For can any strain have\r\n     more of influence than the confession of the Holy Trinity, which is\r\n     proclaimed day by day by the voice of the whole people? Each is\r\n     eager to rival his fellows in confessing, as he well knows how, in\r\n     sacred verses, his faith in Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Thus all\r\n     are made teachers, who else were scarce equal to being scholars.\r\n\r\n     \"No one can deny that in what we say we pay to our sovereign due\r\n     honour. What indeed can do him higher honour than to style him a\r\n     son of the Church? In saying this, we are loyal to him without\r\n     sinning against God. For the Emperor is within the Church, but not\r\n     over the Church; and a religious sovereign seeks, not rejects, the\r\n     Church's aid. This is our doctrine, modestly avowed, but insisted\r\n     on without wavering. Though they threaten fire, or the sword, or\r\n     transportation, we, Christ's poor servants, have learned not to\r\n     fear. And to the fearless nothing is frightful; as Scripture says,\r\n     'Their blows are like the arrows of a child.'\"--_Serm. contr.\r\n     Auxent._\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\nMention is made in this extract of the Psalmody which Ambrose adopted\r\nabout this time. The history of its introduction is curiously connected\r\nwith the subject before us, and interesting, inasmuch as this was the\r\nbeginning of a change in the style of Church music, which spread over\r\nthe West, and continues even among ourselves to this day; it is as\r\nfollows;--\r\n\r\nSoldiers had been sent, as in the former year, to surround his church,\r\nin order to prevent the Catholic service there; but being themselves\r\nChristians, and afraid of excommunication, they went so far as to allow\r\nthe people to enter, but would not let them leave the building. This was\r\nnot so great an inconvenience to them as might appear at first sight:\r\nfor the early Basilicas were not unlike the heathen temples, or our own\r\ncollegiate chapels, that is, part of a range of buildings, which\r\ncontained the lodgings of the ecclesiastics, and formed a fortress in\r\nthemselves, which could easily be fortified from within or blockaded\r\nfrom without. Accordingly, the people remained shut up within the sacred\r\nprecincts for some days, and the bishop with them. There seems to have\r\nbeen a notion, too, that he was to be seized for exile, or put to death;\r\nand they naturally kept about him to \"see the end,\" to suffer with him\r\nor for him, according as their tempers and principles led them. Some\r\nwent so far as to barricade the doors of the Basilica;[364] nor could\r\nAmbrose prevent this proceeding, unnecessary as it was, because of the\r\ngood feelings of the soldiery towards them, and indeed impracticable in\r\nsuch completeness as might be sufficient for security.\r\n\r\nSome persons may think that Ambrose ought to have used his utmost\r\ninfluence against it, whereas in his sermon to the people he merely\r\ninsists on its uselessness, and urges the propriety of looking simply to\r\nGod, and not at all to such expedients, for deliverance. It must be\r\nrecollected, however, that he and his people in no sense drew the sword\r\nfrom its sheath; he confined himself to passive resistance. He had\r\nviolated no law; the Church's property was sought by a tyrant: without\r\nusing any violence, he took possession of that which he was bound to\r\ndefend with his life. He placed himself upon the sacred territory, and\r\nbade them take it and him together, after St. Laurence's pattern, who\r\nsubmitted to be burned rather than deliver up the goods with which he\r\nhad been intrusted for the sake of the poor. However, it was evidently a\r\nvery uncomfortable state of things for a Christian bishop, who might\r\nseem to be responsible for all the consequences, yet was without control\r\nover them. A riot might commence any moment, which it would not be in\r\nhis power to arrest. Under these circumstances, with admirable presence\r\nof mind, he contrived to keep the people quiet, and to direct their\r\nminds to higher objects than those around them, by Psalmody. Sacred\r\nchanting had been one especial way in which the Catholics of Antioch had\r\nkept alive, in Arian times, the spirit of orthodoxy. And from the first\r\na peculiar kind of singing--the antiphonal or responsorial, answering to\r\nour cathedral chanting--had been used in honour of the sacred doctrine\r\nwhich heresy assailed. Ignatius, the disciple of St. Peter, was reported\r\nto have introduced the practice into the Church of Antioch, in the\r\ndoxology to the Trinity. Flavian, afterwards bishop of that see, revived\r\nit during the Arian usurpation, to the great edification and\r\nencouragement of the oppressed Catholics. Chrysostom used it in the\r\nvigils at Constantinople, in opposition to the same heretical party; and\r\nsimilar vigils had been established by Basil in the monasteries of\r\nCappadocia. The assembled multitude, confined day and night within the\r\ngates of the Basilica, were in the situation of a monastic body without\r\nits discipline, and Ambrose rightly considered that the novelty and\r\nsolemnity of the oriental chants, in praise of the Blessed Trinity,\r\nwould both interest and sober them during the dangerous temptation to\r\nwhich they were now exposed. The expedient had even more successful\r\nresults than the bishop anticipated; the soldiers were affected by the\r\nmusic, and took part in it; and, as we hear nothing more of the\r\nblockade, we must suppose that it thus ended, the government being\r\nobliged to overlook what it could not prevent.\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting to the reader to see Augustine's notice of this\r\noccurrence, and the effect of the Psalmody upon himself, at the time of\r\nhis baptism.\r\n\r\n     \"The pious populace (he says in his Confessions) was keeping vigils\r\n     in the church prepared to die, O Lord, with their bishop, Thy\r\n     servant. There was my mother, Thy handmaid, surpassing others in\r\n     anxiety and watching, and making prayers her life.\r\n\r\n     \"I, uninfluenced as yet by the fire of Thy Spirit, was roused\r\n     however by the terror and agitation of the city. Then it was that\r\n     hymns and psalms, after the oriental rite, were introduced, lest\r\n     the spirits of the flock should fail under the wearisome\r\n     delay.\"--_Confess._ ix. 15.\r\n\r\nIn the same passage, speaking of his baptism, he says:--\r\n\r\n     \"How many tears I shed during the performance of Thy hymns and\r\n     chants, keenly affected by the notes of Thy melodious Church! My\r\n     ears drank up those sounds, and they distilled into my heart as\r\n     sacred truths, and overflowed thence again in pious emotion, and\r\n     gushed forth into tears, and I was happy in them.\"--_Ibid._ 14.\r\n\r\nElsewhere he says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Sometimes, from over-jealousy, I would entirely put from me and\r\n     from the Church the melodies of the sweet chants which we use in\r\n     the Psalter, lest our ears seduce us; and the way of Athanasius,\r\n     Bishop of Alexandria, seems the safer, who, as I have often heard,\r\n     made the reader chant with so slight a change of note, that it was\r\n     more like speaking than singing. And yet when I call to mind the\r\n     tears I shed when I heard the chants of Thy Church in the infancy\r\n     of my recovered faith, and reflect that at this time I am affected,\r\n     not by the mere music, but by the subject, brought out, as it is,\r\n     by clear voices and appropriate tune, then, in turn, I confess how\r\n     useful is the practice.\"--_Confess._ x. 50.\r\n\r\nSuch was the influence of the Ambrosian chants when first introduced at\r\nMilan by the great bishop whose name they bear; there they are in use\r\nstill, in all the majestic austerity which gave them their original\r\npower, and a great part of the Western Church uses that modification of\r\nthem which Pope Gregory introduced at Rome in the beginning of the\r\nseventh century.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\nAmbrose implies, in the sermon from which extracts were given above,\r\nthat a persecution, reaching even to the infliction of bodily\r\nsufferings, was at this time exercised upon the bishops of the\r\nExarchate. Certainly he himself was all along in imminent peril of his\r\nlife, or of sudden removal from Milan. However, he made it a point to\r\nfrequent the public places and religious meetings as usual; and indeed\r\nit appears that he was as safe there as at home, for he narrowly escaped\r\nassassination from a hired ruffian of the Empress's, who made his way to\r\nhis bed-chamber for the purpose. Magical arts were also practised\r\nagainst him, as a more secret and certain method of ensuring his\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nI ought to have mentioned, before this, the challenge sent to him by the\r\nArian bishop to dispute publicly with him on the sacred doctrine in\r\ncontroversy; but was unwilling to interrupt the narrative of the contest\r\nabout the Basilica. I will here translate portions of a letter sent by\r\nhim, on the occasion, to the Emperor.\r\n\r\n     \"To the most gracious Emperor and most happy Augustus Valentinian,\r\n     Ambrosius Bishop,--\r\n\r\n     \"Dalmatius, tribune and notary, has come to me, at your Majesty's\r\n     desire, as he assures me, to require me to choose umpires, as\r\n     Auxentius[365] has done on his part. Not that he informed me who\r\n     they were that had already been named; but merely said that the\r\n     dispute was to take place in the consistory, in your Majesty's\r\n     presence, as final arbitrator of it.\r\n\r\n     \"I trust my answer will prove sufficient. No one should call me\r\n     contumacious, if I insist on what your father, of blessed memory,\r\n     not only sanctioned by word of mouth, but even by a law:--That in\r\n     cases of faith, or of ecclesiastics, the judges should be neither\r\n     inferior in function nor separate in jurisdiction--thus the\r\n     rescript runs; in other words, he would have priests decide about\r\n     priests. And this extended even to the case of allegations of wrong\r\n     conduct.\r\n\r\n     \"When was it you ever heard, most gracious Emperor, that in a\r\n     question of faith laymen should be judges of a bishop? What! have\r\n     courtly manners so bent our backs, that we have forgotten the\r\n     rights of the priesthood, that I should of myself put into\r\n     another's hands what God has bestowed upon me? Once grant that a\r\n     layman may set a bishop right, and see what will follow. The layman\r\n     in consequence discusses, while the bishop listens; and the bishop\r\n     is the pupil of the layman. Yet, whether we turn to Scripture or to\r\n     history, who will venture to deny that in a question of faith, in a\r\n     question, I say, of faith, it has ever been the bishop's business\r\n     to judge the Christian Emperor, not the Emperor's to judge the\r\n     bishop?\r\n\r\n     \"When, through God's blessing, you live to be old, then you will\r\n     know what to think of the fidelity of that bishop who places the\r\n     rights of the priesthood at the mercy of laymen. Your father, who\r\n     arrived, through God's blessing, at maturer years, was in the habit\r\n     of saying, 'I have no right to judge between bishops;' but now your\r\n     Majesty says, 'I ought to judge.' He, even though baptized into\r\n     Christ's body, thought himself unequal to the burden of such a\r\n     judgment; your Majesty, who still have to earn a title to the\r\n     sacrament, claims to judge in a matter of faith, though you are a\r\n     stranger to the sacrament to which that faith belongs.\r\n\r\n     \"But Ambrose is not of such value, that he must degrade the\r\n     priesthood for his own well-being. One man's life is not so\r\n     precious as the dignity of all those bishops who have advised me\r\n     thus to write; and who suggested that Auxentius might be choosing\r\n     some heathen perhaps or Jew, whose permission to decide about\r\n     Christ would be a permission to triumph over Him. What would\r\n     pleasure them but blasphemies against Him? What would satisfy them\r\n     but the impious denial of His divinity--agreeing, as they do, full\r\n     well with the Arian, who pronounces Christ to be a creature with\r\n     the ready concurrence of Jews and heathens?\r\n\r\n     \"I would have come to your Majesty's Court, to offer these remarks\r\n     in your presence; but neither my bishops nor my people would let\r\n     me; for they said that, when matters of faith were discussed in the\r\n     Church, this should be in the presence of the people.\r\n\r\n     \"I could have wished your Majesty had not told me to betake myself\r\n     to exile somewhere. I was abroad every day; no one guarded me. I\r\n     was at the mercy of all the world; you should have secured my\r\n     departure to a place of your own choosing. Now the priests say to\r\n     me, 'There is little difference between voluntarily leaving and\r\n     betraying the altar of Christ; for when you leave, you betray it.'\r\n\r\n     \"May it please your Majesty graciously to accept this my declining\r\n     to appear in the Imperial Court. I am not practised in attending\r\n     it, except in your behalf; nor have I the skill to strive for\r\n     victory within the palace, as neither knowing, nor caring to know,\r\n     its secrets.\"--_Ep._ 21.\r\n\r\nThe reader will observe an allusion in the last sentence of this defence\r\nto a service Ambrose had rendered the Emperor and his mother, upon the\r\nmurder of Gratian; when, at the request of Justina, he undertook the\r\ndifficult embassy to the usurper Maximus, and was the means of\r\npreserving the peace of Italy. This Maximus now interfered to defend him\r\nagainst the parties whom he had on a former occasion defended against\r\nMaximus; but other and more remarkable occurrences interposed in his\r\nbehalf, which shall be mentioned in the next section.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[364] Vid. 2 [4] Kings vi. 32.\r\n\r\n[365] The Arian bishop, who had lately come from the East to Milan, had\r\ntaken the name of Auxentius, the heretical predecessor of Ambrose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3. _Ambrose and the Martyrs._\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\nA termination was at length put to the persecution of the Church of\r\nMilan by an occurrence of a very different nature from any which take\r\nplace in these days. And since such events as I am to mention do not\r\noccur now, we are apt to argue, not very logically, that they did not\r\noccur then. I conceive this to be the main objection which will be felt\r\nagainst the following narrative. Miracles never took place then, because\r\nwe do not see reason to believe that they take place now. But it should\r\nbe recollected, that if there are no miracles at present, neither are\r\nthere at present any martyrs. Might we not as cogently argue that no\r\nmartyrdoms took place then, because no martyrdoms take place now? And\r\nmight not St. Ambrose and his brethren have as reasonably disbelieved\r\nthe possible existence of parsonages and pony carriages in the\r\nnineteenth century, as we the existence of martyrs and miracles in the\r\nprimitive age? Perhaps miracles and martyrs go together. Now the account\r\nwhich is to follow does indeed relate to miracles, but then it relates\r\nto martyrs also.\r\n\r\nAnother objection which may be more reasonably urged against the\r\nnarrative is this: that in the fourth century there were many miraculous\r\ntales which even Fathers of the Church believed, but which no one of any\r\nway of thinking believes now. It will be argued, that because some\r\nmiracles are alleged which did not really take place, that therefore\r\nnone which are alleged took place either. But I am disposed to reason\r\njust the contrary way. Pretences to revelation make it probable that\r\nthere is a true Revelation; pretences to miracles make it probable that\r\nthere are real ones; falsehood is the mockery of truth; false Christs\r\nargue a true Christ; a shadow implies a substance. If it be replied that\r\nthe Scripture miracles are these true miracles, and that it is they, and\r\nnone other but they, none after them, which suggested the counterfeit; I\r\nask in turn, if so, what becomes of the original objection, that _no_\r\nmiracles are true, because some are false? If this be so, the Scripture\r\nmiracles are to be believed as little as those after them; and this is\r\nthe very plea which infidels have urged. No; it is not reasonable to\r\nlimit the scope of an argument according to the exigency of our\r\nparticular conclusions; we have no leave to apply the argument _for_\r\nmiracles only to the first century, and that _against_ miracles only to\r\nthe fourth. If forgery in some miracles proves forgery in all, this\r\ntells against the first as well as against the fourth century; if\r\nforgery in some argues truth in others, this avails for the fourth as\r\nwell as for the first.\r\n\r\nAnd I will add, that even credulousness on other occasions does not\r\nnecessarily disqualify a person's evidence for a particular alleged\r\nmiracle; for the sight of one true miracle could not but dispose a man\r\nto believe others readily, nay, too readily, that is, would make him\r\nwhat is called credulous.\r\n\r\nNow let these remarks be kept in mind while I go on to describe the\r\nalleged occurrence which has led to them. I know of no direct objection\r\nto it in particular, viewed in itself; the main objections are such\r\nantecedent considerations as I have been noticing. on\r\noriginal] But if Elisha's bones restored a dead man to life, I know of\r\nno antecedent reason why the relics of Gervasius and Protasius should\r\nnot, as in the instance to be considered, have given sight to the blind.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances were these:--St. Ambrose, at the juncture of affairs\r\nwhich I have described in the foregoing pages, was proceeding to the\r\ndedication of a certain church at Milan, which remains there to this\r\nday, with the name of \"St. Ambrose the Greater;\" and was urged by the\r\npeople to bury relics of martyrs under the altar, as he had lately done\r\nin the case of the Basilica of the Apostles. This was according to the\r\nusage of those times, desirous thereby both of honouring those who had\r\nbraved death for Christ's sake, and of hallowing religious places with\r\nthe mortal instruments of their triumph. Ambrose in consequence gave\r\norders to open the ground in the church of St. Nabor, as a spot likely\r\nto have been the burying-place of martyrs during the heathen\r\npersecutions.\r\n\r\nAugustine, who was in Milan at the time, alleges that Ambrose was\r\ndirected in his search by a dream. Ambrose himself is evidently reserved\r\non the subject in his letter to his sister, though he was accustomed to\r\nmake her his confidant in his ecclesiastical proceedings; he only speaks\r\nof his heart having burnt within him in presage of what was to happen.\r\nThe digging commenced, and in due time two skeletons were discovered, of\r\ngreat size, perfect, and disposed in an orderly way; the head of each,\r\nhowever, separated from the body, and a quantity of blood about. That\r\nthey were the remains of martyrs, none could reasonably doubt; and their\r\nnames were ascertained to be Gervasius and Protasius; how, it does not\r\nappear, but certainly it was not so alleged on any traditionary\r\ninformation or for any popular object, since they proved to be quite new\r\nnames to the Church of the day, though some elderly men at length\r\nrecollected hearing them in former years. Nor is it wonderful that these\r\nsaints should have been forgotten, considering the number of the\r\nApostolic martyrs, among whom Gervasius and Protasius appear to have a\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nIt seems to have been usual in that day to verify the genuineness of\r\nrelics by bringing some of the _energumeni_, or possessed with devils,\r\nto them. Such afflicted persons were present with St. Ambrose during the\r\nsearch; and, before the service for exorcism commenced, one of them gave\r\nthe well-known signs of horror and distress which were customarily\r\nexcited by the presence of what had been the tabernacle of divine grace.\r\n\r\nThe skeletons were raised and transported to the neighbouring church of\r\nSt. Fausta. The next day, June 18th, on which they were to be conveyed\r\nto their destination, a vast concourse of people attended the\r\nprocession. This was the moment chosen by Divine Providence to give, as\r\nit were, signal to His Church, that, though years passed on, He was\r\nstill what He had been from the beginning, a living and a faithful God,\r\nwonder-working as in the lifetime of the Apostles, and true to His word\r\nas spoken by His prophets unto a thousand generations. There was in\r\nMilan a man of middle age, well known in the place, by name Severus,\r\nwho, having become blind, had given up his trade, and was now supported\r\nby charitable persons. Being told the cause of the shoutings in the\r\nstreets, he persuaded his guide to lead him to the sacred relics. He\r\ncame near; he touched the cloth which covered them; and he regained his\r\nsight immediately.\r\n\r\nThis relation deserves our special notice from its distinct\r\nmiraculousness and its circumstantial character; but numerous other\r\nmiracles are stated to have followed. Various diseases were cured and\r\ndemoniacs dispossessed by the touch of the holy bodies or their\r\nenvelopments.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\nNow for the evidence on which the whole matter rests. Our witnesses are\r\nthree: St. Augustine, St. Ambrose, and Paulinus, the secretary of the\r\nlatter, who after his death addressed a short memoir of his life to the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\n1. St. Augustine, in three separate passages in his works, two of which\r\nshall here be quoted, gives his testimony. First, in his City of God, in\r\nan enumeration of miracles which had taken place since the Apostles'\r\ntime. He begins with that which he himself had witnessed in the city of\r\nSt. Ambrose:--\r\n\r\n     \"The miracle,\" he says, \"which occurred at Milan, while I was\r\n     there, when a blind man gained sight, was of a kind to come to the\r\n     knowledge of many, because the city is large, and the Emperor was\r\n     there at the time, and it was wrought with the witness of a vast\r\n     multitude, who had come together to the bodies of the martyrs\r\n     Protasius and Gervasius; which, being at the time concealed and\r\n     altogether unknown, were discovered on the revelation of a dream to\r\n     Ambrose the bishop; upon which that blind man was released from his\r\n     former darkness, and saw the day.\"--xxii. 8.\r\n\r\nAnd next in his sermon upon the feast-day of the two martyrs:--\r\n\r\n     \"We are celebrating, my brethren, the day on which, by Ambrose the\r\n     bishop, that man of God, there was discovered, precious in the\r\n     sight of the Lord, the death of His Saints; of which so great glory\r\n     of the martyrs, then accruing, even I was a witness. I was there, I\r\n     was at Milan, I know the miracles which were done, God attesting to\r\n     the precious death of His Saints; that by those miracles\r\n     henceforth, not in the Lord's sight only, but in the sight of men\r\n     also, that death might be precious. A blind man, perfectly well\r\n     known to the whole city, was restored to sight; he ran, he caused\r\n     himself to be brought near, he returned without a guide. We have\r\n     not yet heard of his death; perhaps he is still alive. In the very\r\n     church where their bodies are, he has vowed his whole life to\r\n     religious service. We rejoiced in his restoration, we left him in\r\n     service.\"--_Serm._ 286. _vid._ also 318.\r\n\r\nThe third passage will be found in the ninth book of St. Augustine's\r\nConfessions, and adds to the foregoing extracts the important fact that\r\nthe miracle was the cause of Justina's relinquishing her persecution of\r\nthe Catholics.\r\n\r\n2. Now let us proceed to the evidence of St Ambrose, as contained in the\r\nsermons which he preached upon the occasion. In the former of the two he\r\nspeaks as follows of the miracles wrought by the relics:--\r\n\r\n     \"Ye know, nay, ye have yourselves seen, many cleansed from evil\r\n     spirits, and numbers loosed from their infirmities, on laying their\r\n     hands on the garment of the saints. Ye see renewed the miracles of\r\n     the old time, when, through the advent of the Lord Jesus, a fuller\r\n     grace poured itself upon the earth; ye see most men healed by the\r\n     very shadow of the sacred bodies. How many are the napkins which\r\n     pass to and fro! what anxiety for garments which are laid upon the\r\n     most holy relics, and made salutary by their very touch! It is an\r\n     object with all to reach even to the extreme border, and he who\r\n     reaches it will be made whole. Thanks be to Thee, Lord Jesus, for\r\n     awakening for us at this time the spirits of the holy martyrs, when\r\n     Thy Church needs greater guardianship. Let all understand the sort\r\n     of champions I ask for--those who may act as champions, not as\r\n     assailants. And such have I gained for you, my religious people,\r\n     such as benefit all, and harm none. Such defenders I solicit, such\r\n     soldiers I possess, not the world's soldiers, but soldiers of\r\n     Christ. I fear not that such will give offence; because the higher\r\n     is their guardianship, the less exceptionable is it also. Nay, for\r\n     them even who grudge me the martyrs, do I desire the martyrs'\r\n     protection. So let them come and see my body-guard; I own I have\r\n     such arms about me. 'These put their trust in chariots and these\r\n     in horses; but we will glory in the name of the Lord our God.'\r\n\r\n     \"Elisæus, as the course of Holy Scripture tells us, when hemmed in\r\n     by the Syrian army, said to his frightened servant, by way of\r\n     calming him, 'There are more that are for us than are against us.'\r\n     And to prove this, he begged that Gehazi's eyes might be opened;\r\n     upon which the latter saw innumerable hosts of Angels present to\r\n     the prophet. We, though we cannot see them, yet are sensible of\r\n     them. Our eyes were held as long as the bodies of the saints lay\r\n     hid in their graves. The Lord has opened our eyes: we have seen\r\n     those aids by which we have often been defended. We had not the\r\n     sight of these, yet we had the possession. And so, as though the\r\n     Lord said to us in our alarm, 'Behold what martyrs I have given\r\n     you!' in like manner our eyes are unclosed, and we see the glory of\r\n     the Lord, manifested, as once in their passion, so now in their\r\n     power. We have got clear, my brethren, of no slight disgrace; we\r\n     had patrons, yet we knew it not. We have found this one thing, in\r\n     which we have the advantage of our forefathers--they lost the\r\n     knowledge of these holy martyrs, and we have obtained it.\r\n\r\n     \"Bring the victorious victims to the spot where is Christ the\r\n     sacrifice. But He upon the altar, who suffered for all; they under\r\n     it, who were redeemed by His passion. I had intended this spot for\r\n     myself, for it is fitting that where the priest had been used to\r\n     offer, there he should repose; but I yield the right side to the\r\n     sacred victims; that spot was due to the martyrs. Therefore let us\r\n     bury the hallowed relics, and introduce them into a fitting home;\r\n     and celebrate the whole day with sincere devotion.\"--_Ep._ 22.\r\n\r\nIn his latter sermon, preached the following day, he pursues the\r\nsubject:--\r\n\r\n     \"This your celebration they are jealous of, who are wont to be;\r\n     and, being jealous of it, they hate the cause of it, and are\r\n     extravagant enough to deny the merits of those martyrs, whose works\r\n     the very devils confess. Nor is it wonderful; it commonly happens\r\n     that unbelievers who deny are less bearable than the devil who\r\n     confesses. For the devil said, 'Jesus, Son of the living Son, why\r\n     hast Thou come to torment us before the time?' And, whereas the\r\n     Jews heard this, yet they were the very men to deny the Son of God.\r\n     And now ye have heard the evil spirits crying out, and confessing\r\n     to the martyrs, that they cannot bear their pains, and saying, 'Why\r\n     are ye come to torment us so heavily?' And the Arians say, 'They\r\n     are not martyrs, nor can they torment the devil, nor dispossess any\r\n     one;' while the torments of the evil spirits are evidenced by their\r\n     own voice, and the benefits of the martyrs by the recovery of the\r\n     healed, and the tokens of the dispossessed.\r\n\r\n     \"The Arians say, 'These are not real torments of evil spirits, but\r\n     they are pretended and counterfeit.' I have heard of many things\r\n     pretended, but no one ever could succeed in feigning himself a\r\n     devil. How is it we see them in such distress when the hand is laid\r\n     on them? What room is here for fraud? what suspicion of imposture?\r\n\r\n     \"They deny that the blind received sight; but he does not deny that\r\n     he was cured. He says, 'I see, who afore saw not.' He says, 'I\r\n     ceased to be blind,' and he evidences it by the fact. They deny the\r\n     benefit, who cannot deny the fact. The man is well known; employed\r\n     as he was, before his affliction, in a public trade, Severus his\r\n     name, a butcher his business: he had given it up when this\r\n     misfortune befell him. He refers to the testimony of men whose\r\n     charities were supporting him; he summons them as evidence of his\r\n     present visitation, who were witnesses and judges of his blindness.\r\n     He cries out that, on his touching the hem of the martyrs' garment,\r\n     which covered the relics, his sight was restored to him. We read in\r\n     the Gospel, that when the Jews saw the cure of the blind man, they\r\n     sought the testimony of the parents. Ask others, if you distrust\r\n     me; ask persons unconnected with him, if you think that his parents\r\n     would take a side. The obstinacy of these Arians is more hateful\r\n     than that of the Jews. When the latter doubted, at least they\r\n     inquired of the parents; these inquire secretly, deny openly, as\r\n     giving credit to the fact, but denying the author.\"--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n3. We may corroborate the evidence of those two Fathers with that of\r\nPaulinus, who was secretary to St. Ambrose, and wrote his life, about\r\nA.D. 411.\r\n\r\n     \"About the same time,\" he says, \"the holy martyrs Protasius and\r\n     Gervasius revealed themselves to God's priest. They lay in the\r\n     Basilica, where, at present, are the bodies of the martyrs Nabor\r\n     and Felix; while, however, the holy martyrs Nabor and Felix had\r\n     crowds to visit them, as well the names as the graves of the\r\n     martyrs Protasius and Gervasius were unknown; so that all who\r\n     wished to come to the rails which protected the graves of the\r\n     martyrs Nabor and Felix, were used to walk on the graves of the\r\n     others. But when the bodies of the holy martyrs were raised and\r\n     placed on litters, thereupon many possessions of the devil were\r\n     detected. Moreover, a blind man, by name Severus, who up to this\r\n     day performs religious service in the Basilica called Ambrosian,\r\n     into which the bodies of the martyrs have been translated, when he\r\n     had touched the garment of the martyrs, forthwith received sight.\r\n     Moreover, bodies possessed by unclean spirits were restored, and\r\n     with all blessedness returned home. And by means of these benefits\r\n     of the martyrs, while the faith of the Catholic Church made\r\n     increase, by so much did Arian misbelief decline.\"--§ 14.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\nNow I want to know what reason is there for stumbling at the above\r\nnarrative, which will not throw uncertainty upon the very fact that\r\nthere was such a Bishop as Ambrose, or such an Empress as Justina, or\r\nsuch a heresy as the Arian, or any Church at all in Milan. Let us\r\nconsider some of the circumstances under which it comes to us.\r\n\r\n1. We have the concordant evidence of three distinct witnesses, of whom\r\nat least two were on the spot when the alleged miracles were wrought,\r\none writing at the time, another some years afterwards in a distant\r\ncountry. And the third, writing after an interval of twenty-six years,\r\nagrees minutely with the evidence of the two former, not adding to the\r\nmiraculous narrative, as is the manner of those who lose their delicate\r\ncare for exactness in their admiration of the things and persons of whom\r\nthey speak.\r\n\r\n2. The miracle was wrought in public, on a person well known, on one who\r\ncontinued to live in the place where it was professedly wrought, and\r\nwho, by devoting himself to the service of the martyrs who were the\r\ninstruments of his cure, was a continual memorial of the mercy which he\r\nprofessed to have received, and challenged inquiry into it, and\r\nrefutation if that were possible.\r\n\r\n3. Ambrose, one of our informants, publicly appealed, at the time when\r\nthe occurrence took place, to the general belief, claimed it for the\r\nmiracle, and that in a sermon which is still extant.\r\n\r\n4. He made his statement in the presence of bitter and most powerful\r\nenemies, who were much concerned, and very able to expose the fraud, if\r\nthere was one; who did, as might be expected, deny the hand of God in\r\nthe matter; but who, for all that appears, did nothing but deny what\r\nthey could not consistently confess, without ceasing to be what they\r\nwere.\r\n\r\n5. A great and practical impression was made upon the popular mind in\r\nconsequence of the alleged miracles: or, in the words of an historian,\r\nwhose very vocation it is to disbelieve them, \"Their effect on the minds\r\nof the people was rapid and irresistible; and the feeble sovereign of\r\nItaly found himself unable to contend with the favourite of\r\nheaven.\"[366]\r\n\r\n6. And so powerfully did all this press upon the Court, that, as the\r\nlast words of this extract intimate, the persecution was given up, and\r\nthe Catholics left in quiet possession of the churches.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, then, are we not in the following dilemma? If the miracle\r\ndid not take place, then St. Ambrose and St. Augustine, men of name,\r\nsaid they had ascertained a fact which they did not ascertain, and said\r\nit in the face of enemies, with an appeal to a whole city, and that\r\ncontinued during a quarter of a century. What instrument of refutation\r\nshall we devise against a case like this, neither so violently _à\r\npriori_ as to supersede the testimony of Evangelists, nor so fastidious\r\nof evidence as to imperil Tacitus or Cæsar? On the other hand, if the\r\nmiracle did take place, a certain measure of authority, more or less,\r\nsurely must thereby attach to St. Ambrose--to his doctrine and his life,\r\nto his ecclesiastical principles and proceedings, to the Church itself\r\nof the fourth century, of which he is one main pillar. The miracle gives\r\na certain sanction to three things at once, to the Catholic doctrine of\r\nthe Trinity, to the Church's resistance of the civil power, and to the\r\ncommemoration of saints and martyrs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDoes it give any sanction to Protestantism and its adherents? shall we\r\naccept it or not? shall we retreat, or shall we advance? shall we\r\nrelapse into scepticism upon all subjects, or sacrifice our deep-rooted\r\nprejudices? shall we give up our knowledge of times past altogether, or\r\nendure to gain a knowledge which we think we have already--the knowledge\r\nof divine truth?\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[366] Gibbon, Hist. ch. 27.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nWHAT SAYS VINCENT OF LERINS?\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\nIt is pretty clear that most persons of this day will be disposed to\r\nwonder at the earnestness shown by the early bishops of the Church in\r\ntheir defence of the Catholic faith. Athanasius, Hilary, Basil, Gregory,\r\nand Ambrose resisted the spread of Arianism at the risk of their lives.\r\nYet their repeated protests and efforts were all about what? The man of\r\nthe world will answer, \"strifes of words, perverse disputings, curious\r\nquestions, which do not tend to advance what ought to be the one end of\r\nall religion, peace and love. This is what comes of insisting on\r\northodoxy; putting the whole world into a fever!\" _Tantum religio\r\npotuit_, etc., as the Epicurean poet says.\r\n\r\nSuch certainly is the phenomenon which we have to contemplate: theirs\r\nwas a state of mind seldom experienced, and little understood, in this\r\nday; however, for that reason, it is at least interesting to the\r\nantiquarian, even were it not a sound and Christian state also. The\r\nhighest end of Church union, to which the mass of educated men now look,\r\nis quiet and unanimity; as if the Church were not built upon faith, and\r\ntruth really the first object of the Christian's efforts, peace but the\r\nsecond. The one idea which statesmen, and lawyers, and journalists, and\r\nmen of letters have of a clergyman is, that he is by profession \"a man\r\nof peace:\" and if he has occasion to denounce, or to resist, or to\r\nprotest, a cry is raised, \"O how disgraceful in a minister of peace!\"\r\nThe Church is thought invaluable as a promoter of good order and\r\nsobriety; but is regarded as nothing more. Far be it from me to seem to\r\ndisparage what is really one of her high functions; but still a part of\r\nher duty will never be tantamount to the whole of it. At present the\r\n_beau ideal_ of a clergyman in the eyes of many is a \"reverend\r\ngentleman,\" who has a large family, and \"administers spiritual\r\nconsolation.\" Now I make bold to say, that confessorship for the\r\nCatholic faith is one part of the duty of Christian ministers, nay, and\r\nChristian laymen too. Yet, in this day, if at any time there is any\r\ndifference in matters of doctrine between Christians, the first and last\r\nwish--the one sovereign object--of so-called judicious men, is to hush\r\nit up. No matter what the difference is about; _that_ is thought so\r\nlittle to the purpose, that your well-judging men will not even take the\r\ntrouble to inquire what it is. It may be, for what they know, a question\r\nof theism or atheism; but they will not admit, whatever it is, that it\r\ncan be more than secondary to the preservation of a good understanding\r\nbetween Christians. They think, whatever it is, it may safely be\r\npostponed for future consideration--that things will right\r\nthemselves--the one pressing object being to present a bold and extended\r\nfront to our external enemies, to prevent the outward fabric of the\r\nChurch from being weakened by dissensions, and insulted by those who\r\nwitness them. Surely the Church exists, in an especial way, for the sake\r\nof the faith committed to her keeping. But our practical men forget\r\nthere may be remedies worse than the disease; that latent heresy may be\r\nworse than a contest of \"party;\" and, in their treatment of the Church,\r\nthey fulfil the satirist's well-known line:--\r\n\r\n     \"Propter vitam vivendi perdere causas.\"\r\n\r\nNo wonder they do so, when they have been so long accustomed to merge\r\nthe Church in the nation, and to talk of \"Protestantism\" in the abstract\r\nas synonymous with true religion; to consider that the characteristic\r\nmerit of our Church is its \"tolerance,\" as they call it, and that its\r\ngreatest misfortune is the exposure to the world of those antagonistic\r\nprinciples and views which are really at work within it. But talking of\r\nexposure, what a scandal it was in St. Peter to exert his apostolical\r\npowers on Ananias; and in St. John, to threaten Diotrephes! What an\r\nexposure in St. Paul to tell the Corinthians he had \"a rod\" for them,\r\nwere they disobedient! One should have thought, indeed, that weapons\r\nwere committed to the Church for use as well as for show; but the\r\npresent age apparently holds otherwise, considering that the Church is\r\nthen most primitive, when it neither cares for the faith itself, nor\r\nuses the divinely ordained means by which it is to be guarded. Now, to\r\npeople who acquiesce in this view, I know well that Ambrose or Augustine\r\nhas not more of authority than an English non-juror; still, to those who\r\ndo not acquiesce in it, it may be some little comfort, some\r\nencouragement, some satisfaction, to see that they themselves are not\r\nthe first persons in the world who have felt and judged of religion in\r\nthat particular way which is now in disrepute.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\nHowever, some persons will allow, perhaps, that doctrinal truth ought to\r\nbe maintained, and that the clergy ought to maintain it; but then they\r\nwill urge that we should not make the path of truth too narrow; that it\r\nis a royal and a broad highway by which we travel heavenward, whereas it\r\nhas been the one object of theologians, in every age, to encroach upon\r\nit, till at length it has become scarcely broad enough for two to walk\r\nabreast in. And moreover, it will be objected, that over-exactness was\r\nthe very fault of the fourth and fifth centuries in particular, which\r\nrefined upon the doctrines of the Holy Trinity and our Lord's\r\nIncarnation, till the way of life became like that razor's edge, which\r\nis said in the Koran to be drawn high over the place of punishment, and\r\nmust be traversed by every one at the end of the world.\r\n\r\nNow I cannot possibly deny, however disadvantageous it may be to their\r\nreputation, that the Fathers do represent the way of faith as narrow,\r\nnay, even as being the more excellent and the more royal for that very\r\nnarrowness. Such is orthodoxy certainly; but here it is obvious to ask\r\nwhether this very characteristic of it may not possibly be rather an\r\nargument for, than against, its divine origin. Certain it is, that such\r\nnicety, as it is called, is not unknown to other religious\r\ndispensations, creeds, and covenants, besides that which the primitive\r\nChurch identified with Christianity. Nor is it a paradox to maintain\r\nthat the whole system of religion, natural as well as revealed, is full\r\nof similar appointments. As to the subject of ethics, even a heathen\r\nphilosopher tells us, that virtue consists in a mean--that is, in a\r\npoint between indefinitely-extending extremes; \"men being in one way\r\ngood, and many ways bad.\" The same principle, again, is seen in the\r\nrevealed system of spiritual communications; the grant of grace and\r\nprivilege depending on positive ordinances, simple and definite--on the\r\nuse of a little water, the utterance of a few words, the imposition of\r\nhands, and the like; which, it will perhaps be granted, are really\r\nessential to the conveyance of spiritual blessings, yet are confessedly\r\nas formal and technical as any creed can be represented to be. In a\r\nword, such technicality is involved in the very idea of a _means_, which\r\nmay even be defined to be a something appointed, at God's inscrutable\r\npleasure, as the necessary condition of something else; and the simple\r\nquestion before us is, merely the _matter of fact_, viz., whether any\r\ndoctrine _is_ set forth by Revelation as necessary to be believed _in\r\norder_ to salvation? Antecedent difficulty in the question there is\r\nnone; or rather, the probability is in favour of there being some\r\nnecessary doctrine, from the analogy of the other parts of religion. The\r\nquestion is simply about the matter of fact.\r\n\r\nThis analogy is perspicuously expressed in one of the sermons of St.\r\nLeo:--\"Not only,\" he says, \"in the exercise of virtue and the observance\r\nof the commandments, but also in the path of faith, strait and difficult\r\nis the way which leads to life; and it requires great pains, and\r\ninvolves great risks, to walk without stumbling along the one footway of\r\nsound doctrine, amid the uncertain opinions and the plausible untruths\r\nof the unskilful, and to escape all peril of mistake when the toils of\r\nerror are on every side.\"--_Serm._ 25.\r\n\r\nSt. Gregory Nazianzen says the same thing:--\"We have bid farewell to\r\ncontentious deviations of doctrine, and compensations on either side,\r\nneither Sabellianizing nor Arianizing. These are the sports of the evil\r\none, who is a bad arbiter of our matters. But we, pacing along the\r\nmiddle and royal way, _in which also the essence of the virtues lies_,\r\nin the judgment of the learned, believe in Father, Son, and Holy\r\nGhost.\"--_Orat._ 32.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, then, I see nothing very strange either in orthodoxy\r\nlying in what at first sight appears like subtle and minute exactness of\r\ndoctrine, or in its being our duty to contend even to confessorship for\r\nsuch exactness. Whether it be thus exact, and whether the exactness of\r\nAmbrose, Leo, or Gregory be the true and revealed exactness, is quite\r\nanother question: all I say is, that it is no great difficulty to\r\nbelieve that it may be what they say it is, both as to its truth and as\r\nto its importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\nBut now supposing the question is asked, are Ambrose, Leo, and Gregory\r\nright? and is our Church right in maintaining with them the Athanasian\r\ndoctrine on those sacred points to which it relates, and condemning\r\nthose who hold otherwise? what answer is to be given? I answer by asking\r\nin turn, supposing any one inquired how we know that Ambrose, Leo, or\r\nGregory was right and our Church right, in receiving St. Paul's\r\nEpistles, what answer we should make? The answer would be, that it is a\r\nmatter of history that the Apostle wrote those letters which are\r\nascribed to him. And what is meant by its being a matter of history?\r\nwhy, that it has ever been so believed, so declared, so recorded, so\r\nacted on, from the first down to this day; that there is no assignable\r\npoint of time when it was not believed, no assignable point at which the\r\nbelief was introduced; that the records of past ages fade away and\r\nvanish _in_ the belief; that in proportion as past ages speak at all,\r\nthey speak in one way, and only fail to bear a witness, when they fail\r\nto have a voice. What stronger testimony can we have of a past fact?\r\n\r\nNow evidence such as this have we for the Catholic doctrines which\r\nAmbrose, Leo, or Gregory maintained; they have never and nowhere _not_\r\nbeen maintained; or in other words, wherever we know anything positive\r\nof ancient times and places, there we are told of these doctrines also.\r\nAs far as the records of history extend, they include these doctrines as\r\navowed always, everywhere, and by all. This is the great canon of the\r\n_Quod semper, quod ubique, quod ab omnibus_, which saves us from the\r\nmisery of having to find out the truth for ourselves from Scripture on\r\nour independent and private judgment. He who gave Scripture, also gave\r\nus the interpretation of Scripture; and He gave the one and the other\r\ngift in the same way, by the testimony of past ages, as matter of\r\nhistorical knowledge, or as it is sometimes called, by Tradition. We\r\nreceive the Catholic doctrines as we receive the canon of Scripture,\r\nbecause, as our Article expresses it, \"_of their authority\" there \"was\r\nnever any doubt in the Church_.\"\r\n\r\nWe receive them on Catholic Tradition, and therefore they are called\r\nCatholic doctrines. And that they are Catholic, is a proof that they are\r\nApostolic; they never could have been universally received in the\r\nChurch, unless they had had their origin in the origin of the Church,\r\nunless they had been made the foundation of the Church by its founders.\r\nAs the separate successions of bishops in various countries have but one\r\ncommon origin, the Apostles, so what has been handed down through these\r\nseparate successions comes from that one origin. The Apostolic College\r\nis the only point in which all the lines converge, and from which they\r\nspring. Private traditions, wandering unconnected traditions, are of no\r\nauthority, but permanent, recognised, public, definite, intelligible,\r\nmultiplied, concordant testimonies to one and the same doctrine, bring\r\nwith them an overwhelming evidence of apostolical origin. We ground the\r\nclaims of orthodoxy on no powers of reasoning, however great, on the\r\ncredit of no names, however imposing, but on an external fact, on an\r\nargument the same as that by which we prove the genuineness and\r\nauthority of the four gospels. The unanimous tradition of all the\r\nchurches to certain articles of faith is surely an irresistible\r\nevidence, more trustworthy far than that of witnesses to certain facts\r\nin a court of law, by how much the testimony of a number is more cogent\r\nthan the testimony of two or three. That this really is the ground on\r\nwhich the narrow line of orthodoxy was maintained in ancient times, is\r\nplain from an inspection of the writings of the very men who maintained\r\nit, Ambrose, Leo, and Gregory, or Athanasius and Hilary, and the rest,\r\nwho set forth its Catholic character in more ways than it is possible\r\nhere to instance or even explain.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\nHowever, in order to give the general reader some idea of the state of\r\nthe case, I will make some copious extracts from the famous tract of\r\nVincent of Lerins on Heresy, written in A.D. 434, immediately after the\r\nthird Ecumenical Council, held against Nestorius. The author was\r\noriginally a layman, and by profession a soldier. In after life he\r\nbecame a monk and took orders. Lerins, the site of his monastery, is one\r\nof the small islands off the south coast of France. He first states what\r\nthe principle is he would maintain, and the circumstances under which he\r\nmaintains it; and if his principle is reasonable and valuable in itself,\r\nso does it come to us with great weight under the circumstances which he\r\ntells us led him to his exposition of it:[367]\r\n\r\n     \"Inquiring often,\" he says, \"with great desire and attention, of\r\n     very many excellent, holy, and learned men, how and by what means I\r\n     might assuredly, and as it were by some general and ordinary way,\r\n     discern the true Catholic faith from false and wicked heresy; to\r\n     this question I had usually this answer from them all, that whether\r\n     I or any other desired to find out the fraud of heretics, daily\r\n     springing up, and to escape their snares, and to continue in a\r\n     sound faith himself safe and sound, that he ought, by two ways, by\r\n     God's assistance, to defend and preserve his faith; that is, first,\r\n     by the authority of the law of God; secondly, by the tradition of\r\n     the Catholic Church.\"--_Ch._ 2.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed he is speaking of the _mode_ in which an\r\n_individual_ is to seek and attain the truth; and it will be observed\r\nalso, as the revered Bishop Jebb has pointed out, that he is\r\nallowing[368] and sanctioning the use of personal inquiry. He\r\nproceeds:--\r\n\r\n     \"Here some man, perhaps, may ask, seeing the canon of the Scripture\r\n     is perfect, and most abundantly of itself sufficient for all\r\n     things, what need we join unto it the authority of the Church's\r\n     understanding and interpretation? The reason is this, because the\r\n     Scripture being of itself so deep and profound, all men do not\r\n     understand it in one and the same sense, but divers men diversely,\r\n     this man and that man, this way and that way, expound and interpret\r\n     the sayings thereof, so that to one's thinking, 'so many men, so\r\n     many opinions' almost may be gathered out of them: for Novatian\r\n     expoundeth it one way, Photinus another; Sabellius after this sort,\r\n     Donatus after that; Arius, Eunomius, Macedonius will have this\r\n     exposition, Apollinaris and Priscilian will have that; Jovinian,\r\n     Pelagius, Celestius, gather this sense, and, to conclude, Nestorius\r\n     findeth out that; and therefore very necessary it is for the\r\n     avoiding of so great windings and turnings, of errors so various,\r\n     that the line of expounding the Prophets and Apostles be directed\r\n     and drawn, according to the rule of the Ecclesiastical and Catholic\r\n     sense.\r\n\r\n    \"Again, within the Catholic Church itself we are greatly to consider\r\n    that we hold that which hath been believed _everywhere_, _always_,\r\n    and _of all men_: for that is truly and properly _Catholic_ (as the\r\n    very force and nature of the word doth declare) which comprehendeth\r\n    all things in general after an universal manner, and that shall we\r\n    do if we follow _universality, antiquity, consent_. Universality\r\n    shall we follow thus, if we profess that one faith to be true which\r\n    the whole Church throughout the world acknowledgeth and confesseth.\r\n    Antiquity shall we follow, if we depart not any whit from those\r\n    senses which it is plain that our holy elders and fathers generally\r\n    held. Consent shall we likewise follow, if in this very Antiquity\r\n    itself we hold the definitions and opinions of all, or at any rate\r\n    almost all, the priests and doctors together.\"--_Ch._ 2, 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes said, that what is called orthodoxy or Catholicism is\r\nonly the opinion of one or two Fathers--- fallible men, however able\r\nthey might be, or persuasive--who created a theology, and imposed it on\r\ntheir generation, and thereby superseded Scriptural truth and the real\r\ngospel. Let us see how Vincent treats such individual teachers, however\r\nhighly gifted. He is speaking in the opening sentence of the Judaizers\r\nof the time of St. Paul:--\r\n\r\n     \"When, therefore, such kind of men, wandering up and down through\r\n     provinces and cities to set their errors to sale, came also unto\r\n     the Galatians, and these, after they had heard them, were delighted\r\n     with the filthy drugs of heretical novelty, loathing the truth, and\r\n     casting up again the heavenly manna of the Apostolic and Catholic\r\n     doctrine: the authority of his Apostolic office so puts itself\r\n     forth as to decree very severely in this sort. 'But although (quoth\r\n     he) we or an Angel from heaven evangelize unto you beside that\r\n     which we have evangelized, be he Anathema.'[369] What meaneth this\r\n     that he saith, 'But although we?' why did he not rather say, 'But\r\n     although I?' that is to say, Although Peter, although Andrew,\r\n     although John, yea, finally, although the whole company of the\r\n     Apostles, evangelize unto you otherwise than we have evangelized,\r\n     be he accursed. A terrible censure, in that for maintaining the\r\n     possession of the first faith, he spared not himself, nor any other\r\n     of the Apostles! But this is a small matter: 'Although an Angel\r\n     from heaven (quoth he) evangelize unto you, beside that which I\r\n     have evangelized, be he Anathema,' he was not contented for keeping\r\n     the faith once delivered to make mention of man's weak nature,\r\n     unless also he included those excellent creatures the Angels....\r\n     But peradventure he uttered those words slightly, and cast them\r\n     forth rather of human affection than decreed them by divine\r\n     direction. God forbid: for it followeth, and that urged with great\r\n     earnestness of repeated inculcation, 'As I have foretold you (quoth\r\n     he), and now again I tell you, If anybody evangelize unto you\r\n     beside that which you have received, be he Anathema.' He said not,\r\n     If any man preach unto you beside that which you have received, let\r\n     him be blessed, let him be commended, let him be received, but let\r\n     him be _Anathema_, that is, separated, thrust out, excluded, lest\r\n     the cruel infection of one sheep with his poisoned company corrupt\r\n     the sound flock of Christ.\"--_Ch._ 12 and 13.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.\r\n\r\nHere, then, is a point of doctrine which must be carefully insisted on.\r\nThe Fathers are primarily to be considered as _witnesses_, not as\r\n_authorities_. They are witnesses of an existing state of things, and\r\ntheir treatises are, as it were, _histories_,--teaching us, in the first\r\ninstance, matters of fact, not of opinion. Whatever they themselves\r\nmight be, whether deeply or poorly taught in Christian faith and love,\r\nthey speak, not their own thoughts, but the received views of their\r\nrespective ages. The especial value of their works lies in their opening\r\nupon us a state of the Church which else we should have no notion of. We\r\nread in their writings a great number of high and glorious principles\r\nand acts, and our first thought thereupon is, \"All this must have had an\r\nexistence somewhere or other in those times. These very men, indeed, may\r\nbe merely speaking by rote, and not understand what they say; but it\r\nmatters not to the profit of their writings what they were themselves.\"\r\nIt matters not to the profit of their writings, nor again to the\r\nauthority resulting from them; for the _times_ in which they wrote of\r\ncourse _are_ of authority, though the Fathers themselves may have none.\r\nTertullian or Eusebius may be nothing more than bare witnesses; yet so\r\nmuch as this they have a claim to be considered.\r\n\r\nThis is even the strict Protestant view. We are not obliged to take the\r\nFathers as _authorities_, only as _witnesses_. Charity, I suppose, and\r\npiety will prompt the Christian student to go further, and to believe\r\nthat men who laboured so unremittingly, and suffered so severely in the\r\ncause of the Gospel, really did possess some little portion of that\r\nearnest love of the truth which they professed, and were enlightened by\r\nthat influence for which they prayed; but I am stating the strict\r\nProtestant doctrine, the great polemical principle ever to be borne in\r\nmind, that the Fathers are to be adduced in controversy merely as\r\ntestimonies to an existing state of things, not as authorities. At the\r\nsame time, no candid Protestant will be loth to admit, that the state of\r\nthings to which they bear witness, _is_, as I have already said, a most\r\ngrave and conclusive authority in guiding us in those particulars of our\r\nduty about which Scripture is silent; succeeding, as it does, so very\r\nclose upon the age of the Apostles.\r\n\r\nThus much I claim of consistent Protestants, and thus much I grant to\r\nthem. Gregory and the rest may have been but nominal Christians.\r\nAthanasius himself may have been very dark in all points of doctrine, in\r\nspite of his twenty years' exile and his innumerable perils by sea and\r\nland; the noble Ambrose, a high and dry churchman; and Basil, a mere\r\nmonk. I do not dispute these points; though I claim \"the right of\r\nprivate judgment,\" so far as to have my own very definite opinion in the\r\nmatter, which I keep to myself.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.\r\n\r\nSuch being the plain teaching of the Fathers, and such the duty of\r\nfollowing it, Vincentius proceeds to speak of the misery of doubting and\r\nchange:--\r\n\r\n     \"Which being so, he is a true and genuine Catholic that loveth the\r\n     truth of God, the Church, the body of Christ; that preferreth\r\n     nothing before the religion of God; nothing before the Catholic\r\n     faith; not any man's authority, not love, not wit, not eloquence,\r\n     not philosophy; but contemning all these things, and in faith\r\n     abiding fixed and stable, whatsoever he knoweth the Catholic Church\r\n     universally in old times to have holden, that only he purposeth\r\n     with himself to hold and believe; but whatsoever doctrine, new and\r\n     not before heard of, such an one shall perceive to be afterwards\r\n     brought in of some one man, beside all or contrary to all the\r\n     saints, let him know that doctrine doth not pertain to religion,\r\n     but rather to temptation, especially being instructed with the\r\n     sayings of the blessed Apostle St. Paul. For this is that which he\r\n     writeth in his first Epistle to the Corinthians: 'There must (quoth\r\n     he) be heresies also, that they which are approved may be made\r\n     manifest among you.' ...\r\n\r\n     \"O the miserable state of [waverers]! with what seas of cares, with\r\n     what storms, are they tossed! for now at one time, as the wind\r\n     driveth them, they are carried away headlong in error; at another\r\n     time, coming again to themselves, they are beaten back like\r\n     contrary waves; sometime with rash presumption they allow such\r\n     things as seem uncertain, at another time of pusillanimity they are\r\n     in fear even about those things which are certain; doubtful which\r\n     way to take, which way to return, what to desire, what to avoid,\r\n     what to hold, what to let go; which misery and affliction of a\r\n     wavering and unsettled heart, were they wise, is as a medicine of\r\n     God's mercy towards them.\r\n\r\n     \"Which being so, oftentimes calling to mind and remembering the\r\n     selfsame thing, I cannot sufficiently marvel at the great madness\r\n     of some men, at so great impiety of their blinded hearts, lastly,\r\n     at so great a licentious desire of error, that they be not content\r\n     with the rule of faith once delivered us, and received from our\r\n     ancestors, but do every day search and seek for new doctrine, ever\r\n     desirous to add to, to change, and to take away something from,\r\n     religion; as though that were not the doctrine of God, which it is\r\n     enough to have once revealed, but rather man's institution, which\r\n     cannot but by continual amendment (or rather correction) be\r\n     perfected.\"--_Ch._ 25, 26.\r\n\r\n\r\n7.\r\n\r\nThen he takes a text, and handles it as a modern preacher might do. His\r\ntext is this:--\r\n\r\n     \"O Timothy, keep the _depositum_, avoiding the profane novelties of\r\n     words, and oppositions of falsely-called knowledge, which certain\r\n     professing have erred about the faith.\"\r\n\r\nHe dwells successively upon _Timothy_, on the _deposit_, on _avoiding_,\r\non _profane_, and on _novelties_.\r\n\r\nFirst, _Timothy_ and the \"_deposit_:\"--\r\n\r\n     \"Who at this day is Timothy, but either generally the whole Church,\r\n     or especially the whole body of prelates, who ought either\r\n     themselves to have a sound knowledge of divine religion, or who\r\n     ought to infuse it into others? What is meant by _keep the\r\n     deposit_? Keep it (quoth he) for fear of thieves, for danger of\r\n     enemies, lest when men be asleep, they oversow cockle among that\r\n     good seed of wheat, which the Son of man hath sowed in His field.\r\n     'Keep (quoth he) the deposit.' What is meant by this deposit? that\r\n     is, that which is committed to thee, not that which is invented of\r\n     thee; that which thou hast received, not that which thou hast\r\n     devised; a thing not of wit, but of learning; not of private\r\n     assumption, but of public tradition; a thing brought to thee, not\r\n     brought forth of thee; wherein thou must not be an author, but a\r\n     keeper; not a beginner, but a follower; not a leader, but an\r\n     observer. Keep the deposit. Preserve the talent of the Catholic\r\n     faith safe and undiminished; that which is committed to thee, let\r\n     that remain with thee, and that deliver. Thou hast received gold,\r\n     render then gold; I will not have one thing for another; do not for\r\n     gold render either impudently lead, or craftily brass; I will, not\r\n     the show, but the very nature of gold itself. O Timothy, O priest,\r\n     O teacher, O doctor, if God's gift hath made thee meet and\r\n     sufficient by thy wit, exercise, and learning, be the Beseleel of\r\n     the spiritual tabernacle, engrave the precious stones of God's\r\n     doctrine, faithfully set them, wisely adorn them, give them\r\n     brightness, give them grace, give them beauty. That which men\r\n     before believed obscurely, let them by thy exposition understand\r\n     more clearly. Let posterity rejoice for coming to the understanding\r\n     of that by thy means, which antiquity without that understanding\r\n     had in veneration. Yet for all this, in such sort deliver the same\r\n     things which thou hast learned, that albeit thou teachest after a\r\n     new manner yet thou never teach new things.\"\r\n\r\nNext, \"_avoiding_:\"--\r\n\r\n     \"'O Timothy (quoth he), keep the deposit, avoid profane novelties\r\n     of words.' Avoid (quoth he) as a viper, as a scorpion, as a\r\n     basilisk, lest they infect thee not only by touching, but also with\r\n     their very eyes and breath. What is meant by _avoid_?[370] that is,\r\n     not so much as to eat with any such. What importeth this _avoid_?\r\n     'If any man (quoth he) come unto you, and bring not this\r\n     doctrine,'[371] what doctrine but the Catholic and universal, and\r\n     that which, with incorrupt tradition of the truth, hath continued\r\n     one and the selfsame, through all successions of times, and that\r\n     which shall continue for ever and ever? What then? 'Receive him not\r\n     (quoth he) into the house, nor say God speed; for he that saith\r\n     unto him God speed, communicateth with his wicked works.\"\r\n\r\nThen, \"_profane_:\"--\r\n\r\n     \"'Profane novelties of words' (quoth he); what is _profane_? Those\r\n     which have no holiness in them, nought of religion, wholly external\r\n     to the sanctuary of the Church, which is the temple of God.\r\n     'Profane novelties of words (quoth he), of words, that is,\r\n     novelties of doctrines, novelties of things, novelties of opinions,\r\n     contrary to old usage, contrary to antiquity, which if we receive,\r\n     of necessity the faith of our blessed ancestors, either all, or a\r\n     great part of it, must be overthrown; the faithful people of all\r\n     ages and times, all holy saints, all the chaste, all the continent,\r\n     all the virgins, all the clergy, the deacons, the priests, so many\r\n     thousands of confessors, so great armies of martyrs, so many famous\r\n     and populous cities and commonwealths, so many islands, provinces,\r\n     kings, tribes, kingdoms, nations; to conclude, almost now the whole\r\n     world, incorporated by the Catholic faith to Christ their Head,\r\n     must needs be said, so many hundreds of years, to have been\r\n     ignorant, to have erred, to have blasphemed, to have believed they\r\n     knew not what.\"\r\n\r\nLastly, \"_novelties_:\"--\r\n\r\n     \"'Avoid (quoth he) profane _novelties_ of words,' to receive and\r\n     follow which was never the custom of Catholics, but always of\r\n     heretics. And, to say truth, what heresy hath ever burst forth, but\r\n     under the name of some certain man, in some certain place, and at\r\n     some certain time? Who ever set up any heresy, but first divided\r\n     himself from the consent of the universality and antiquity of the\r\n     Catholic Church? Which to be true, examples do plainly prove. For\r\n     who ever before that profane Pelagius presumed so much of man's\r\n     free will, that he thought not the grace of God necessary to aid it\r\n     in every particular good act? Who ever before his monstrous\r\n     disciple Celestius denied all mankind to be bound with the guilt of\r\n     Adam's transgression? Who ever before sacrilegious Arius durst rend\r\n     in pieces the Unity of Trinity? Who ever before wicked Sabellius\r\n     durst confound the Trinity of Unity? Who ever before cruel Novatian\r\n     affirmed God to be merciless, in that He had rather the death of a\r\n     sinner than that he should return and live? Who ever before Simon\r\n     Magus, durst affirm that God our Creator was the Author of evil,\r\n     that is, of our wickedness, impieties, and crimes; because God (as\r\n     he said) so with His own hands made man's very nature, that by a\r\n     certain proper motion and impulse of an enforced will, it can do\r\n     nothing else, desire nothing else, but to sin. Such examples are\r\n     infinite, which for brevity-sake I omit, by all which,\r\n     notwithstanding, it appeareth plainly and clearly enough, that it\r\n     is, as it were, a custom and law in all heresies, ever to take\r\n     great pleasure in profane novelties, to loath the decrees of our\r\n     forefathers, and to make shipwreck of faith, by oppositions of\r\n     falsely-called knowledge; contrariwise that this is usually proper\r\n     to all Catholics, to keep those things which the holy Fathers have\r\n     left, and committed to their charge, to condemn profane novelties,\r\n     and, as the Apostle hath said, and again forewarned, 'if any man\r\n     shall preach otherwise than that which is received,' to\r\n     anathematize him.\"--_Ch._ 27-34.\r\n\r\nFrom these extracts, which are but specimens of the whole Tract, I come\r\nto the conclusion that Vincent was a very sorry Protestant.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[367] The Oxford translation of 1837 is used in the following extracts.\r\n\r\n[368] [He allows of it in the _Absence_ at the time of the Church's\r\nauthoritative declaration concerning the particular question in debate.\r\nHe would say, \"There was no need of any Ecumenical Council to condemn\r\nNestorius; he was condemned by Scripture and tradition already.\"--1872.]\r\n\r\n[369] Gal. i. 8.\r\n\r\n[370] 1 Cor. v. 11.\r\n\r\n[371] 2 John 10, 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nWHAT SAYS THE HISTORY OF APOLLINARIS?\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the judgment of the early Church, the path of doctrinal truth is\r\nnarrow; but, in the judgment of the world in all ages, it is so broad as\r\nto be no path at all. This I have said above; also, that the maintenance\r\nof the faith is considered by the world to be a strife of words,\r\nperverse disputings, curious questionings, and unprofitable\r\ntechnicality, though by the Fathers it is considered necessary to\r\nsalvation. What they call heresy, the man of the world thinks just as\r\ntrue as what they call orthodoxy, and only then wrong when\r\npertinaciously insisted on by its advocates, as the early Fathers\r\ninsisted on orthodoxy. Now do, or do not, Protestants here take part\r\nwith the world in disliking, in abjuring doctrinal propositions and\r\narticles, such as the early Church fought for? Certainly they do. Well,\r\nthen, if they thus differ from the Church of the Fathers, how can they\r\nfancy that the early Church was Protestant?\r\n\r\nIn the Treatise I have been quoting, Vincent gives us various instances\r\nof heresiarchs, and tells us what he thinks about them. Among others, he\r\nspeaks of Apollinaris and his fall; nor can we have a better instance\r\nthan that of Apollinaris of the grave distress and deep commiseration\r\nwith which the early Fathers regarded those whom the present Protestant\r\nworld thinks very good kind of men, only fanciful and speculative, with\r\nsome twist or hobby of their own. Apollinaris, better than any one else,\r\nwill make us understand what was thought of the guilt of heresy in times\r\nwhich came next to the Apostolic, because the man was so great, and his\r\ncharacteristic heresy was so small. The charges against Origen have a\r\nmanifest breadth and width to support them; Nestorius, on the other\r\nhand, had no high personal merits to speak for him; but Apollinaris,\r\nafter a life of laborious service in the cause of religion, did but\r\nsuffer himself to teach that the Divine Intelligence in our Lord\r\nsuperseded the necessity of His having any other, any human intellect;\r\nand for this apparently small error, he was condemned. Of course it was\r\nnot small really; for one error leads to another, and did eventually in\r\nhis case; but to all appearance it was small, yet it was promptly and\r\nsternly denounced and branded by East and West; would it be so\r\nruthlessly smitten by Protestants now?\r\n\r\nA brief sketch of his history, and of the conduct of the Church towards\r\nhim, may not be out of place in the experiments I am making with a view\r\nof determining the relation in which modern Protestantism stands towards\r\nprimitive Christianity.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\nHis father, who bore the same name, was a native of Alexandria, by\r\nprofession a grammarian or schoolmaster; who, passing from Berytus to\r\nthe Syrian Laodicea, married and settled there, and eventually rose to\r\nthe presbyterate in the Church of that city. Apollinaris, the son, had\r\nbeen born there in the early part of the fourth century, and was\r\neducated for the profession of rhetoric. After a season of suspense, as\r\nto the ultimate destination of his talents, he resolved on dedicating\r\nthem to the service of the Church; and, after being admitted into\r\nreader's orders, he began to distinguish himself by his opposition to\r\nphilosophical infidelity. His work against Porphyry, the most valuable\r\nand elaborate of his writings, was extended to as many as thirty books.\r\nDuring the reign of Julian, when the Christian schools were shut up, and\r\nthe Christian youth were debarred from the use of the classics, the two\r\nApollinares, father and son, exerted themselves to supply the\r\ninconvenience thence resulting from their own resources. They wrote\r\nheroical pieces, odes, tragedies, and dialogues, after the style of\r\nHomer and Plato, and other standard authors, upon Christian subjects;\r\nand the younger, who is the subject of this Chapter, wrote and dedicated\r\nto Julian a refutation of Paganism, on grounds of reason.\r\n\r\nNor did he confine himself to the mere external defence of the Gospel,\r\nor the preparatory training of its disciples. His expositions on\r\nScripture were the most numerous of his works; he especially excelled in\r\neliciting and illustrating its sacred meaning, and he had sufficient\r\nacquaintance with the Hebrew to enable him to translate or comment on\r\nthe original text. There was scarcely a controversy of the age, prolific\r\nas it was in heresies, into which he did not enter. He wrote against the\r\nArians, Eunomians, Macedonians, and Manichees; against Origen and\r\nMarcellus; and in defence of the Millenarians. Portions of these\r\ndoctrinal writings are still extant, and display a vigour and elegance\r\nof style not inferior to any writer of his day.\r\n\r\nSuch a man seemed to be raised up providentially for the Church's\r\ndefence in an evil day; and for awhile he might be said resolutely and\r\nnobly to fulfil his divinely appointed destiny. The Church of Laodicea,\r\nwith the other cities of Syria, was at the time in Arian possession;\r\nwhen the great Athanasius passed through on his return to Egypt, after\r\nhis second exile (A.D. 348), Apollinaris communicated with him, and was\r\nin consequence put out of the Church by the bishop in possession. On the\r\ndeath of Constantius (A.D. 361), the Catholic cause prevailed; and\r\nApollinaris was consecrated to that see, or to that in Asia Minor which\r\nbears the same name.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\nSuch was the station, such the reputation of Apollinaris, at the date of\r\nthe Council thereupon held at Alexandria, A.D. 362, for settling the\r\ndisorders of the Church; and yet, in the proceedings of this celebrated\r\nassembly, the first intimation occurs of the existence of that doctrinal\r\nerror by which he has been since known in history, though it is not\r\nthere connected with his name. The troubles under Julian succeeded, and\r\ndiverted the minds of all parties to other objects. The infant heresy\r\nslept till about the year 369; when it gives us evidence of its\r\nexistence in the appearance of a number of persons, scattered about\r\nSyria and Greece, who professed it in one form or other, and by the\r\nsolemn meeting of a Council in the former country, in which its\r\ndistinctive tenets were condemned. We find that even at this date it had\r\nrun into those logical consequences which make even a little error a\r\ngreat one; still the name of Apollinaris is not connected with them.\r\n\r\nThe Council, as I have said, was held in Syria, but the heresy which\r\noccasioned it had already, it seems, extended into Greece; for a\r\ncommunication, which the there assembled bishops addressed to Athanasius\r\non the subject, elicited from him a letter, still extant, addressed to\r\nEpictetus, bishop of Corinth, who had also written to him upon it. This\r\nletter, whether from tenderness to Apollinaris, or from difficulty in\r\nbringing the heresy home to him, still does not mention his name.\r\nAnother work written by Athanasius against the heresy, at the very end\r\nof his life, with the keenness and richness of thought which distinguish\r\nhis writings generally, is equally silent; as are two letters to friends\r\nabout the same date, which touch more or less on the theological points\r\nin question. All these treatises seem to be forced from the writer, and\r\nare characterized by considerable energy of expression: as if the\r\nCatholics addressed were really perplexed with the novel statements of\r\ndoctrine, and doubtful how Athanasius would meet them, or at least\r\nrequired his authority before pronouncing upon them; and, on the other\r\nhand, as if Athanasius himself were fearful of conniving at them,\r\nwhatever private reasons he might have for wishing to pass them over.\r\nYet there is nothing in the history or documents of the times to lead\r\none to suppose that more than a general suspicion attached to\r\nApollinaris; and, if we may believe his own statement, Athanasius died\r\nin persuasion of his orthodoxy. A letter is extant, written by\r\nApollinaris on this subject, in which he speaks of the kind intercourse\r\nhe had with the Patriarch of Alexandria, and of their agreement in\r\nfaith, as acknowledged by Athanasius himself. He claims him as his\r\nmaster, and at the same time slightly hints that there had been points\r\nto settle between them, in which he himself had given way. In another,\r\nwritten to an Egyptian bishop, he seems to refer to the very epistle to\r\nEpictetus noticed above, expressing his approbation of it. It is known,\r\nmoreover, that Athanasius gave the usual letters of introduction to\r\nTimotheus, Apollinaris's intimate friend, and afterwards the most\r\nextravagant teacher of his sect, on his going to the Western Bishops,\r\nand that, on the ground of his controversial talents against the Arians.\r\n\r\nAthanasius died in A.D. 371 or 373; and that bereavement of the Church\r\nwas followed, among its calamities, by the open avowal of heresy on the\r\npart of Apollinaris. In a letter already referred to, he claims\r\nAthanasius as agreeing with him, and then proceeds to profess one of the\r\nvery tenets against which Athanasius had written. In saying this, I have\r\nno intention of accusing so considerable a man of that disingenuousness\r\nwhich is almost the characteristic mark of heresy. It was natural that\r\nAthanasius should have exercised an influence over his mind; and it was\r\nas natural that, when his fellow-champion was taken to his rest, he\r\nshould have found himself able to breathe more freely, yet have been\r\nunwilling to own it. While indulging in the speculations of a private\r\njudgment, he might still endeavour to persuade himself that he was not\r\noutstepping the teaching of the Catholic Church. On the other hand, it\r\nappears that the ecclesiastical authorities of the day, even when he\r\nprofessed his heresy, were for awhile incredulous about the fact, from\r\ntheir recollection of his former services and his tried orthodoxy, and\r\nfrom the hope that he was but carried on into verbal extravagances by\r\nhis opposition to Arianism. Thus they were as unwilling to impute to him\r\nheresy, as he to confess it. Nay, even when he had lost shame, attacked\r\nthe Catholics with violence, and formed his disciples into a sect, not\r\neven then was he himself publicly animadverted on, though his creed was\r\nanathematized. His first condemnation was at Rome, several years after\r\nAthanasius's death, in company with Timotheus, his disciple. In the\r\nrecords of the General Council of Constantinople, several years later,\r\nhis sect is mentioned as existing, with directions how to receive back\r\ninto the Church those who applied for reconciliation. He outlived this\r\nCouncil about ten years; his sect lasted only twenty years beyond him;\r\nbut in that short time it had split into three distinct denominations,\r\nof various degrees of heterodoxy, and is said to have fallen more or\r\nless into the errors of Judaism.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\nIf this is a faithful account of the conduct of the Church towards\r\nApollinaris, no one can accuse its rulers of treating him with haste or\r\nharshness; still they accompanied their tenderness towards him\r\npersonally with a conscientious observance of their duties to the\r\nCatholic Faith, to which our Protestants are simply dead. Who now in\r\nEngland, except very high churchmen, would dream of putting a man out of\r\nthe Church for what would be called a mere speculative or metaphysical\r\nopinion? Why could not Apollinaris be a \"spiritual man,\" have \"a\r\njustifying faith,\" \"apprehend\" our Lord's merits, have \"a personal\r\ninterest in redemption,\" be in possession of \"experimental religion,\"\r\nand be able to recount his \"experiences,\" though he had some vagaries of\r\nhis own about the nature of our Lord's soul? But such ideas did not\r\napprove themselves to Christians of the fourth century, who followed up\r\nthe anathemas of Holy Church with their own hearty adhesion to them.\r\nEpiphanius speaks thus mournfully:--\r\n\r\n     \"That aged and venerable man, who was ever so singularly dear to\r\n     us, and to the holy Father, Athanasius, of blessed memory, and to\r\n     all orthodox men, Apollinaris, of Laodicea, he it was who\r\n     originated and propagated this doctrine. And at first, when we were\r\n     assured of it by some of his disciples, we disbelieved that such a\r\n     man could admit such an error into his path, and patiently waited\r\n     in hope, till we might ascertain the state of the case. For we\r\n     argued that his youths, who came to us, not entering into the\r\n     profound views of so learned and clear-minded a master, had\r\n     invented these statements of themselves, not gained them from him.\r\n     For there were many points in which those who came to us were at\r\n     variance with each other: some of them ventured to say that Christ\r\n     had brought down His body from above (and this strange theory,\r\n     admitted into the mind, developed itself into worse notions);\r\n     others of them denied that Christ had taken a soul; and some\r\n     ventured to say that Christ's body was consubstantial with the\r\n     Godhead, and thereby caused great confusion in the East\"--_Hær._\r\n     lxxvii. 2.\r\n\r\nHe proceeds afterwards:--\r\n\r\n     \"Full of distress became our life at that time, that between\r\n     brethren so exemplary as the forementioned, a quarrel should at all\r\n     have arisen, that the enemy of man might work divisions among us.\r\n     And great, my brethren, is the mischief done to the mind from such\r\n     a cause. For were no question ever raised on the subject, the\r\n     matter would be most simple (for what gain has accrued to the world\r\n     from such novel doctrine, or what benefit to the Church? rather has\r\n     it not been an injury, as causing hatred and dissension?): but when\r\n     the question was raised, it became formidable; it did not tend to\r\n     good; for whether a man disallows this particular point, or even\r\n     the slightest, still it is a denial. For we must not, even in a\r\n     trivial matter, turn aside from the path of truth. No one of the\r\n     ancients ever maintained it--prophet, or apostle, or evangelist, or\r\n     commentator--down to these our times, when this so perplexing\r\n     doctrine proceeded from that most learned man aforesaid. His was a\r\n     mind of no common cultivation; first in the preliminaries of\r\n     literature in Greek education, then as a master of dialectics and\r\n     argumentation. Moreover, he was most grave in his whole life, and\r\n     reckoned among the very first of those who ever deserved the love\r\n     of the orthodox, and so continued till his maintenance of this\r\n     doctrine. Nay, he had undergone banishment for not submitting to\r\n     the Arians;--but why enlarge on it? It afflicted us much, and gave\r\n     us a sorrowful time, as is the wont of our enemy.\"--_Ibid._ 24.\r\n\r\nSt. Basil once got into trouble from a supposed intimacy with\r\nApollinaris. He had written one letter to him on an indifferent matter,\r\nin 356, when he himself was as yet a layman, and Apollinaris orthodox\r\nand scarcely in orders. This was magnified by his opponent Eustathius\r\ninto a correspondence and intercommunion between the archbishop and\r\nheresiarch. As in reality Basil knew very little even of his works, the\r\ndescription which the following passages give is valuable, as being, in\r\nfact, a sort of popular opinion about Apollinaris, more than an\r\nindividual judgment. Basil wrote the former of the two in defence of\r\nhimself; in the latter, other errors of Apollinaris are mentioned,\r\nbesides those to which I have had occasion to allude, for, as I have\r\nsaid, errors seldom are found single.\r\n\r\n     \"For myself,\" says Basil, \"I never indeed considered Apollinaris as\r\n     an enemy; nay, there are respects in which I reverence him;\r\n     however, I did not so connect myself with him as to make myself\r\n     answerable for his alleged faults, considering, too, that I have a\r\n     complaint of my own against him, on reading some of his\r\n     compositions. I hear, indeed, that he is become the most copious of\r\n     all writers; yet I have fallen in with but few of his works, for I\r\n     have not leisure to search into such, and besides, I do not easily\r\n     form the acquaintance of recent writers, being hindered by bodily\r\n     health from continuing even the study of inspired Scripture\r\n     laboriously, and as is fitting.\"--_Ep._ 244, § 3.\r\n\r\nThe other passage runs thus:--\r\n\r\n     \"After Eustathius comes Apollinaris; he, too, no slight disturber\r\n     of the Church; for, having a facility in writing and a tongue which\r\n     served him on every subject, he has filled the world with his\r\n     compositions, despising the warning, 'Beware of making many books,'\r\n     because in the many are many faults. For how is it possible, in\r\n     much speaking, to escape sin?\"--_Ep._ 263, § 4.\r\n\r\nAnd then he goes on to mention some of the various gross errors, to\r\nwhich by that time he seemed to be committed.\r\n\r\nLastly, let us hear Vincent of Lerins about him:--\r\n\r\n     \"Great was the heat and great the perplexity which Apollinaris\r\n     created in the minds of his auditory, when the authority of the\r\n     Church drew them one way, and the influence of their teacher drew\r\n     them the other, so that, wavering and hesitating between the two,\r\n     they could not decide which was to be chosen. You will say, he\r\n     ought at once to have been put aside; yes, but he was so great a\r\n     man, that his word carried with it an extraordinary credence. Who\r\n     indeed was his superior in acumen, in long practice, in view of\r\n     doctrine? As to the number of his volumes against heresies, I will\r\n     but mention as a specimen of them that great and noble work of his\r\n     against Porphyry, in not less than thirty books, with its vast\r\n     collection of arguments. He would have been among the\r\n     master-builders of the Church, had not the profane lust of\r\n     heretical curiosity incited him to strike out something new, to\r\n     pollute withal his labours throughout with the taint of leprosy, so\r\n     that his teaching was rather a temptation to the Church than an\r\n     edification.\"--_Ch._ 16.\r\n\r\nIt is a solemn and pregnant fact, that two of the most zealous and\r\nforward of Athanasius's companions in the good fight against Arianism,\r\nMarcellus and Apollinaris, fell away into heresies of their own; nor did\r\nthe Church spare them, for all their past services. \"Let him that\r\nthinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall\"[missing a \".\"?]\r\n\r\n  \"Alas, my brother! round thy tomb,\r\n    In sorrow kneeling, and in fear,\r\n  We read the pastor's doom,\r\n    Who speaks and will not hear.\r\n\r\n  \"The gray-haired saint may fail at last,\r\n    The surest guide a wanderer prove;\r\n  Death only binds us fast\r\n    To the bright shore of love.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nAND WHAT SAY JOVINIAN AND HIS COMPANIONS?\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\nVincentius wrote in the early part of the fifth century, that is, three\r\ngood centuries and more after the death of St. John; accordingly, we\r\nsometimes hear it said that, true though it be, that the Catholic\r\nsystem, as we Anglicans maintain it, existed at that time, nevertheless\r\nit was a system quite foreign to the pure Gospel, though introduced at a\r\nvery early age; a system of Pagan or Jewish origin, which crept in\r\nunawares, and was established on the ruins of the Apostolic faith by the\r\nepiscopal confederation, which mainly depended on it for its own\r\nmaintenance. In other words, it is considered by some persons to be a\r\nsystem of priestcraft, destructive of Christian liberty.\r\n\r\nNow, it is no paradox to say that _this_ would be a sufficient answer to\r\nsuch a speculation, were there no other, viz., that no answer _can_ be\r\nmade to it. I say, supposing it could not be answered at all, that fact\r\nwould be a fair answer. All discussion must have data to go upon;\r\nwithout data, neither one party can dispute nor the other. If I\r\nmaintained there were negroes in the moon, I should like to know how\r\nthese same philosophers would answer me. Of course they would not\r\nattempt it: they would confess they had no grounds for denying it, only\r\nthey would add, that I had no grounds for asserting it. They would not\r\nprove that I was wrong, but call upon me to prove that I was right.\r\nThey would consider such a mode of talking idle and childish, and\r\nunworthy the consideration of a serious man; else, there would be no end\r\nof speculation, no hope of certainty and unanimity in anything. Is a man\r\nto be allowed to say what he will, and bring no reasons for it? Even if\r\nhis hypothesis fitted into the facts of the case, still it would be but\r\nan hypothesis, and might be met, perhaps, in the course of time, by\r\nanother hypothesis, presenting as satisfactory a solution of them. But\r\nif it would not be necessarily true, though it were adequate, much less\r\nis it entitled to consideration before it is proved to be\r\nadequate--before it is actually reconciled with the facts of the case;\r\nand when another hypothesis has, from the beginning, been in the\r\npossession of the field. From the first it has been believed that the\r\nCatholic system is Apostolic; convincing reasons must be brought against\r\nthis belief, and in favour of another, before that other is to be\r\npreferred to it.\r\n\r\nNow the new and gratuitous hypothesis in question does not appear, when\r\nexamined, even to harmonize with the facts of the case. One mode of\r\ndealing with it is this:--Take a large view of the faith of Christians\r\nduring the centuries before Constantine established their religion. Is\r\nthere any family likeness in it to Protestantism? Look at it, as\r\nexisting during that period in different countries, and is it not one\r\nand the same, and a reiteration of itself, as well as singularly unlike\r\nReformed Christianity? Hermas with his visions, Ignatius with his\r\ndogmatism, Irenæus with his praise of tradition and of the Roman See,\r\nClement with his allegory and mysticism, Cyprian with his \"Out of the\r\nChurch is no salvation,\" and Methodius with his praise of Virginity, all\r\nof them writers between the first and fourth centuries, and witnesses\r\nof the faith of Rome, Africa, Gaul, Asia Minor, Syria, and Egypt,\r\ncertainly do not represent the opinions of Luther and Calvin. They\r\nstretch over the whole of Christendom; they are consistent with each\r\nother; they coalesce into one religion; but it is not the religion of\r\nthe Reformation. When we ask, \"Where was your Church before Luther?\"\r\nProtestants answer, \"Where were you this morning before you washed your\r\nface?\" But, if Protestants can clean themselves into the likeness of\r\nCyprian or Irenæus, they must scrub very hard, and have well-nigh\r\nlearned the art of washing the blackamoor white.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\nIf the Church system be not Apostolic, it must, some time or other, have\r\nbeen introduced, and then comes the question, when? We maintain that the\r\nknown circumstances of the previous history are such as to preclude the\r\npossibility of any time being assigned, ever so close upon the Apostles,\r\nat which the Church system did not exist. Not only cannot a time be\r\nshown when the free-and-easy system now in fashion did generally exist,\r\nbut no time can be shown in which it can be colourably maintained that\r\nthe Church system was brought in. It will be said, of course, that the\r\nChurch system was gradually introduced. I do not say there have never\r\nbeen introductions of any kind; but let us see what they amount to here.\r\nSelect for yourself your doctrine, or your ordinance, which you say was\r\nintroduced, and try to give the history of its introduction.\r\nHypothetical that history will be, of course; but we will not scruple at\r\nthat;--we will only ask one thing, that it should cut clean between the\r\nreal facts of the case, though it bring none in its favour; but it will\r\nnot be able to do even this. The rise of the doctrine of the Holy\r\nTrinity, of the usage of baptizing infants, of the eucharistic offering,\r\nof the episcopal prerogatives, do what one will, can hardly be made\r\nshort of Apostolical times. This is not the place to prove all this; but\r\nso fully is it felt to be so, by those who are determined not to admit\r\nthese portions of Catholicism, that in their despair of drawing the line\r\nbetween the first and following centuries, they make up their minds to\r\nintrude into the first, and boldly pursue their supposed error into the\r\nvery presence of some Apostle or Evangelist. Thus St. John is sometimes\r\nmade the voluntary or involuntary originator of some portions of our\r\ncreed. Dr. Priestley, I believe, conjectures that his amanuensis played\r\nhim false, as regards his teaching upon the sacred doctrine which that\r\nphilosopher opposed. Others take exceptions to St. Luke, because he\r\ntells us of the \"handkerchiefs, or aprons,\" which \"were brought from St.\r\nPaul's body\" for the cure of diseases. Others have gone a step further,\r\nand have said, \"Not Paul, but Jesus.\" Infidel, Socinian, and Protestant,\r\nagree in assailing the Apostles, rather than submitting to the Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\nLet our Protestant friends go to what quarter of Christendom they will,\r\nlet them hunt among heretics or schismatics, into Gnosticism outside the\r\nChurch, or Arianism within it, still they will find no hint or vestige\r\nanywhere of that system which they are now pleased to call Scriptural.\r\nGranting that Catholicism be a corruption, is it possible that it should\r\nbe a corruption springing up everywhere at once? Is it conceivable that\r\nat least no opponent should have retained any remnant of the system it\r\nsupplanted?--that no tradition of primitive purity should remain in any\r\npart of Christendom?--that no protest, or controversy, should have been\r\nraised, as a monument against the victorious error? This argument,\r\nconclusive against modern Socinianism, is still more cogent and striking\r\nwhen directed against Puritanism. At least, there _were_ divines in\r\nthose early days who denied the sacred doctrine which Socinianism also\r\ndisowns, though commonly they did not profess to do so on authority of\r\ntradition; but who ever heard of Erastians, Supralapsarians,\r\nIndependents, Sacramentarians, and the like, before the sixteenth and\r\nseventeenth centuries? It would be too bold to go to prove a negative: I\r\ncan only say that I do not know in what quarter to search for the\r\nrepresentatives, in the early Church, of that \"Bible religion,\" as it is\r\ncalled, which is now so much in favour. At first sight, one is tempted\r\nto say that all errors come over and over again; that this and that\r\nnotion now in vogue has been refuted in times past. This is indeed a\r\ngeneral truth--nay, for what I know, these same bold speculatists will\r\nbring it even as an argument for their not being in error, that\r\nAntiquity says nothing at all, good or bad, about their opinions. I\r\ncannot answer for the extent to which they will throw the _onus\r\nprobandi_ on us; but I protest--be it for us, or be it against us--I\r\ncannot find this very religion of theirs in ancient times, whether in\r\nfriend or foe, Jew or Pagan, Montanist or Novatian; though I find surely\r\nenough, and in plenty, the general characteristics, which are\r\nconspicuous in their philosophy, of self-will, eccentricity, and love of\r\nparadox.\r\n\r\nSo far from it, that if we wish to find the rudiments of the Catholic\r\nsystem clearly laid down in writing, those who are accounted least\r\northodox will prove as liberal in their information about it as the\r\nstrictest Churchman. We can endure even the heretics better than our\r\nopponents can endure the Apostles. Tertullian, though a Montanist, gives\r\nno sort of encouragement to the so-called Bible Christians of this day;\r\nrather he would be the object of their decided abhorrence and disgust.\r\nOrigen is not a whit more of a Protestant, though he, if any, ought,\r\nfrom the circumstances of his history, to be a witness against us. It is\r\naverred that the alleged revolution of doctrine and ritual was\r\nintroduced by the influence of the episcopal system; well, here is a\r\nvictim of episcopacy, brought forward by our opponents as such. Here is\r\na man who was persecuted by his bishop, and driven out of his country;\r\nand whose name after his death has been dishonourably mentioned, both by\r\nCouncils and Fathers. He surely was not in the episcopal conspiracy, at\r\nleast; and perchance may give the latitudinarian, the anabaptist, the\r\nErastian, and the utilitarian, some countenance. Far from it; he is as\r\nhigh and as keen, as removed from softness and mawkishness, as ascetic\r\nand as reverential, as any bishop among them. He is as superstitious (as\r\nmen now talk), as fanatical, as formal, as Athanasius or Augustine.\r\nCertainly, there seems something providential in the place which Origen\r\nholds in the early Church, considering the direction which theories\r\nabout it are now taking; and much might be said on that subject.\r\n\r\nTake another instance:--There was, in the fourth century, a party of\r\ndivines who were ecclesiastically opposed to the line of theologians,\r\nwhose principles had been, and were afterwards, dominant in the Church,\r\nsuch as Athanasius, Jerome, and Epiphanius; I mean, for instance,\r\nEusebius, Cyril of Jerusalem, and others who were more or less connected\r\nwith the Semi-Arians. If, then, we see that in all points, as regards\r\nthe sacraments and sacramentals, the Church and its ministers, the form\r\nof worship, and other religious duties of Christians, Eusebius and Cyril\r\nagree entirely with the most orthodox of their contemporaries, with\r\nthose by party and country most separated from them, we have a proof\r\nthat that system, whatever it turns out to be, was received before their\r\ntime--_i.e._ before the establishment of Christianity under Constantine;\r\nin other words, that we must look for the gradual corruption of the\r\nChurch, if it is to be found, not when wealth pampered it, and power and\r\npeace brought its distant portions together, but while it was yet poor,\r\nhumble, and persecuted, in those times which are commonly considered\r\npure and primitive. Again, the genius of Arianism, as a party and a\r\ndoctrine, was to discard antiquity and mystery; that is, to resist and\r\nexpose what is commonly called priestcraft. In proportion, then, as\r\nCyril and Eusebius partook of that spirit, so far would they be in their\r\nown cast of mind indisposed to the Catholic system, both considered in\r\nitself and as being imposed on them.\r\n\r\nNow, have the writers in question any leaning or tenderness for the\r\ntheology of Luther and Calvin? rather they are as unconscious of its\r\nexistence as of modern chemistry or astronomy. That faith is a closing\r\nwith divine mercy, not a submission to a divine announcement, that\r\njustification and sanctification are distinct, that good works do not\r\nbenefit the Christian, that the Church is not Christ's ordinance and\r\ninstrument, and that heresy and dissent are not necessarily and\r\nintrinsically evil: notions such as these they do not oppose, simply\r\nbecause to all appearance they never heard of them. To take a single\r\npassage, which first occurs, in which Eusebius, one of the theologians\r\nin question, gives us his notion of the Catholic Church:--\r\n\r\n     \"These attempts,\" he says, speaking of the arts of the enemy, \"did\r\n     not long avail him, Truth ever consolidating itself, and, as time\r\n     went on, shining into broader day. For while the devices of\r\n     adversaries were extinguished at once, confuted by their very\r\n     activity,--one heresy after another presenting its own novelty, the\r\n     former specimens ever dissolving and wasting variously in manifold\r\n     and multiform shapes,--the brightness of the Catholic and only true\r\n     Church went forward increasing and enlarging, yet ever in the same\r\n     things and in the same way, beaming on the whole race of Greeks and\r\n     barbarians with the awfulness, and simplicity, and nobleness, and\r\n     sobriety, and purity of its divine polity and philosophy. Thus the\r\n     calumny against our whole creed died with its day, and there\r\n     continued alone our discipline, sovereign among all, and\r\n     acknowledged to be pre-eminent in awfulness and sobriety, in its\r\n     divine and philosophical doctrines; so that no one of this day\r\n     dares to cast any base reproach upon our faith, nor any such\r\n     calumny such as it was once customary for our enemies to\r\n     use.\"--_Hist._ iv. 7.\r\n\r\nOr to take a passage on a different subject, which almost comes first to\r\nhand, from St. Cyril, another of this school of divines:--\r\n\r\n     \"Only be of good cheer, only work, only strive cheerfully; for\r\n     nothing is lost. Every prayer of thine, every psalm thou singest is\r\n     recorded; every alms-deed, every fast is recorded; every marriage\r\n     duly observed is recorded; continence kept for God's sake is\r\n     recorded; but the first crowns in record are those of virginity and\r\n     purity; and thou shalt shine as an Angel. But as thou hast gladly\r\n     listened to the good things, listen without shrinking to the\r\n     contrary. Every covetous deed of thine is recorded; every fleshly\r\n     deed, every perjury, every blasphemy, every sorcery, every theft,\r\n     every murder. All these things are henceforth recorded, if thou do\r\n     these after baptism; for thy former deeds are blotted out.\"--_Cat._\r\n     xv. 23.\r\n\r\nCyril and Eusebius, I conceive, do not serve at all better than Origen\r\nto show that faith is a feeling, that it makes a man independent of the\r\nChurch, and is efficacious apart from baptism or works. I do not know\r\nany ancient divines of whom more can be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\nWhere, then, is primitive Protestantism to be found? There is one chance\r\nfor it, not in the second and third centuries, but in the fourth; I mean\r\nin the history of Aerius, Jovinian, and Vigilantius,--men who may be\r\ncalled, by some sort of analogy, the Luther, Calvin, and Zwingle, of the\r\nfourth century. And they have been so considered both by Protestants and\r\nby their opponents, so covetous, after all, of precedent are innovators,\r\nso prepared are Catholics to believe that there is nothing new under the\r\nsun. Let me, then, briefly state the history and tenets of these three\r\nreligionists.\r\n\r\n1. Aerius was an intimate friend of Eustathius, bishop of Sebaste, in\r\nArmenia, whose name has already occurred above. Both had embraced a\r\nmonastic life; and both were Arians in creed. Eustathius, being raised\r\nto the episcopate, ordained his friend presbyter, and set him over the\r\nalmshouse or hospital of the see. A quarrel followed, from whatever\r\ncause; Aerius left his post, and accused Eustathius of covetousness, as\r\nit would appear, unjustly. Next he collected a large number of persons\r\nof both sexes in the open country, where they braved the severe weather\r\nof that climate. A congregation implies a creed, and Aerius founded or\r\nformed his own on the following points: 1. That there was no difference\r\nbetween bishop and presbyter. 2. That it was judaical to observe Easter,\r\nbecause Christ is our Passover. 3. That it was useless, or rather\r\nmischievous, to name the dead in prayer, or to give alms for them. 4.\r\nThat fasting was judaical, and a yoke of bondage. If it be right to\r\nfast, he added, each should choose his own day; for instance, Sunday\r\nrather than Wednesday and Friday: while Passion Week he spent in\r\nfeasting and merriment. And this is pretty nearly all we know of\r\nAerius, who flourished between A.D. 360 and 370.\r\n\r\n2. Jovinian was a Roman monk, and was condemned, first by Siricius at\r\nRome, then by St. Ambrose and other bishops at Milan, about A.D. 390. He\r\ntaught, 1. That eating with thanksgiving was just as good as fasting. 2.\r\nThat, _cæteris paribus_, celibacy, widowhood, and marriage, were on a\r\nlevel in the baptized. 3. That there was no difference of rewards\r\nhereafter for those who had preserved their baptism; and, 4. That those\r\nwho had been baptized with full faith could not fall; if they did, they\r\nhad been baptized, like Simon Magus, only with water. He persuaded\r\npersons of both sexes at Rome, who had for years led a single life, to\r\ndesert it. The Emperor Honorius had him transported to an island on the\r\ncoast of Dalmatia; he died in the beginning of the fifth century.\r\n\r\n3. Vigilantius was a priest of Gaul or Spain, and flourished just at the\r\ntime Jovinian died: he taught, 1. That those who reverenced relics were\r\nidolaters; 2. That continence and celibacy were wrong, as leading to the\r\nworst scandals; 3. That lighting candles in churches during the day, in\r\nhonour of the martyrs, was wrong, as being a heathen rite; 4. That\r\nApostles and Martyrs had no presence at their tombs; 5. That it was\r\nuseless to pray for the dead; 6. That it was better to keep wealth and\r\npractice habitual charity, than to strip one's-self of one's property\r\nonce for all; and 7. That it was wrong to retire into the desert. This\r\nis what we learn of these three (so-called) reformers, from the writings\r\nof Epiphanius and Jerome.\r\n\r\nNow you may say, \"What can we require more than this? Here we have, at\r\nthe time of a great catastrophe, Scriptural truth come down to us in the\r\nburning matter which melted and preserved it, in the persecuting\r\nlanguage of Epiphanius and Jerome. When corruptions began to press\r\nthemselves on the notice of Christians, here you find three witnesses\r\nraising their distinct and solemn protest in different parts of the\r\nChurch, independently of each other, in Gaul, in Italy, and in Asia\r\nMinor, against prayers for the dead, veneration of relics, candles in\r\nthe day-time, the merit of celibacy, the need of fasting, the observance\r\nof days, difference in future rewards, the defectibility of the\r\nregenerate, and the divine origin of episcopacy. Here is pure and\r\nscriptural Protestantism.\" Such is the phenomenon on which a few remarks\r\nare now to be offered.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.\r\n\r\n1. I observe then, first, that this case so presented to us, does not\r\nanswer the purpose required. The doctrine of these three Protestants, if\r\nI am to be forced into calling them so, is, after all, but negative. We\r\nknow what they protested _against_, not what they protested _for_. We do\r\nnot know what the system of doctrine and ritual was which they\r\nsubstituted for the Catholic, or whether they had any such. Though they\r\ndiffered from the ancients, there is no proof that they agreed with the\r\nmoderns. Parties which differ from a common third, do not necessarily\r\nagree with each other; from two negative propositions nothing is\r\ninferred. For instance, the moral temper and doctrinal character of the\r\nsixteenth century is best symbolized by its views about faith and\r\njustification, to which I have already referred, and upon the duty of\r\neach individual man drawing his own creed from the Scriptures. This is\r\nits positive shape, as far as it may be considered positive at all. Now\r\ndoes any one mean to maintain that Aerius, Jovinian, or Vigilantius,\r\nheld justification by faith only in the sense of John Wesley, or of\r\nJohn Newton? Did they consider that baptism was a thing of nought; that\r\nfaith did everything; that faith was trust, and the perfection of faith\r\nassurance; that it consisted in believing that \"I am pardoned;\" and that\r\nworks might be left to themselves, to come as they might, as being\r\n_necessary_ fruits of faith, without our trouble? Did they know anything\r\nof the \"apprehensive\" power of faith, or of man's proneness to consider\r\nhis imperfect services, done in and by grace, as adequate to purchase\r\neternal life? There is no proof they did. Let then these three\r\nprotesters be ever so cogent an argument against the Catholic creed,\r\nthis does not bring them a whit nearer to the Protestant; though in fact\r\nthere is nothing to show that their protest was founded on historical\r\ngrounds, or on any argument deeper than such existing instances of\r\nsuperstition and scandal in detail as are sure to accumulate round\r\nrevelation.\r\n\r\nFurther, even if a modern wished, he would not be able to put up with\r\neven the negative creed of these primitive protesters, whatever his\r\nparticular persuasion might be. Their protest suits no sect whatever of\r\nthis day. It is either too narrow or too liberal. The Episcopalian, as\r\nhe is styled, will not go along with Aerius's notions about bishops; nor\r\nwill the Lutheran subscribe to the final perseverance of the saints; nor\r\nwill the strict Calvinist allow that all fasting is judaical; nor will\r\nthe Baptist admit the efficacy of baptism: one man will wonder why none\r\nof the three protested against the existence of the Church itself;\r\nanother that none of them denied the received doctrine of penance; a\r\nthird that all three let pass the received doctrine of the Eucharist.\r\nTheir protestations are either too much or too little for any one of\r\ntheir present admirers. There is no one of any of the denominations of\r\nthis day but will think them wrong in some points or other; that is all\r\nwe know about them; but if we all think them wrong on some points, is\r\nthat a good reason why we should take them as an authority on others?\r\n\r\nOr, again, do we wish to fix upon what _can_ be detected in their creed\r\nof a positive character, and distinct from their protests? We happen to\r\nbe told what it was in the case of one of them. Aerius was an Arian;\r\ndoes this mend matters? Is there any agreement at all between him and\r\nLuther here? If Aerius is an authority against bishops, or against set\r\nfasts, why is he not an authority against the Creed of St. Athanasius?\r\n\r\n2. What has been last said leads to a further remark. I observe, then,\r\nthat if two or three men in the fourth century are sufficient, against\r\nthe general voice of the Church, to disprove one doctrine, then still\r\nmore are two or three of an earlier century able to disprove another.\r\nWhy should protesters in century four be more entitled to a hearing than\r\nprotesters in century three? Now it so happens, that as Aerius,\r\nJovinian, and Vigilantius in the fourth protested against austerities,\r\nso did Praxeas, Noetus, and Sabellius in the third protest against the\r\nCatholic or Athanasian doctrine of the Holy Trinity. A much stronger\r\ncase surely could be made out in favour of the latter protest than of\r\nthe former. Noetus was of Asia Minor, Praxeas taught in Rome, Sabellius\r\nin Africa. Nay, we read that in the latter country their doctrine\r\nprevailed among the common people, then and at an earlier date, to a\r\nvery great extent, and that the true faith was hardly preached in the\r\nchurches.\r\n\r\n3. Again, the only value of the protest of these three men would be, of\r\ncourse, that they _represented_ others; that they were exponents of a\r\nstate of opinion which prevailed either in their day or before them,\r\nand which was in the way to be overpowered by the popular corruptions.\r\nWhat are Aerius and Jovinian to me as individuals? They are worth\r\nnothing, unless they can be considered as organs and witnesses of an\r\nexpiring cause. Now, it does not appear that they themselves had any\r\nnotion that they were speaking in behalf of any one, living or dead,\r\nbesides themselves. They argued against prayers for the departed from\r\nreason, and against celibacy, hopeless as the case might seem, from\r\nScripture. They ridiculed one usage, and showed the ill consequence of\r\nanother. All this might be very cogent in itself, but it was the conduct\r\nof men who stood by themselves and were conscious of it. If Jovinian had\r\nknown of writers of the second and third centuries holding the same\r\nviews, Jovinian would have been as prompt to quote them as Lutherans are\r\nto quote Jovinian. The protest of these men shows that certain usages\r\nundeniably existed in the fourth century; it does not prove that they\r\ndid not exist also in the first, second, and third. And how does the\r\nfact of their living in the fourth century prove there were Protestants\r\nin the first? What we are looking for is a Church of primitive heretics,\r\nof baptists and independents of the Apostolic age, and we must not be\r\nput off with the dark and fallible protests of the Nicene era.\r\n\r\nFar different is the tone of Epiphanius in his answer to Aerius:--\r\n\r\n     \"If one need refer,\" he says, speaking of fasting, \"to the\r\n     constitution of the Apostles, why did they there determine the\r\n     fourth and sixth day to be ever a fast, except Pentecost? and\r\n     concerning the six days of the Pascha, why do they order us to take\r\n     nothing at all but bread, salt, and water?... Which of these\r\n     parties is the rather correct? this deceived man, who is now among\r\n     us, and is still alive, or they who were witnesses before us,\r\n     possessing before our time the tradition in the Church, and they\r\n     having received it from their fathers, and those very fathers\r\n     again having learned it from those who lived before them?... The\r\n     Church has received it, and it is unanimously confessed in the\r\n     whole world, before Aerius and Aerians were born.\"--_Hær._ 75, §\r\n     6.\r\n\r\n4. Once more, there is this very observable fact in the case of each of\r\nthe three, that their respective protests seem to have arisen from some\r\npersonal motive. Certainly what happens to a man's self often brings a\r\nthing home to his mind more forcibly, makes him contemplate it steadily,\r\nand leads to a successful investigation into its merits. Yet still,\r\nwhere we know personal feelings to exist in the maintenance of any\r\ndoctrine, we look more narrowly at the proof for ourselves; thinking it\r\nnot impossible that the parties may have made up their minds on grounds\r\nshort of reason. It is natural to feel distrust of controversialists,\r\nwho, to all appearance, would not have been earnest against a doctrine\r\nor practice, except that it galled themselves. Now it so happens that\r\neach of these three Reformers lies open to this imputation. Aerius is\r\nexpressly declared by Epiphanius to have been Eustathius's competitor\r\nfor the see of Sebaste, and to have been disgusted at failing. _He_ is\r\nthe preacher against bishops. Jovinian was bound by a monastic vow, and\r\n_he_ protests against fasting and coarse raiment. Vigilantius was a\r\npriest; and, therefore, _he_ disapproves the celibacy of the clergy. No\r\nopinion at all is here ventured in favour of clerical celibacy; still it\r\nis remarkable that in the latter, as in the two former cases, private\r\nfeeling and public protest should have gone together.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.\r\n\r\nThese distinct considerations are surely quite sufficient to take away\r\nour interest in these three Reformers. These men are not an historical\r\nclue to a lost primitive creed, more than Origen or Tertullian; and much\r\nless do they afford any support to the creed of those moderns who would\r\nfain shelter themselves behind them. That there were abuses in the\r\nChurch then, as at all times, no one, I suppose, will deny. There may\r\nhave been extreme opinions and extreme acts, pride and pomp in certain\r\nbishops, over-honour paid to saints, fraud in the production of relics,\r\nextravagance in praising celibacy, formality in fasting; and such errors\r\nwould justify a protest, which the Catholic Fathers themselves are not\r\nslow to make; but they would not justify that utter reprobation of\r\nrelics, of celibacy, and of fasting, of episcopacy, of prayers for the\r\ndead, and of the doctrine of defectibility, which these men\r\navowed--avowed without the warrant of the first ages--on grounds of\r\nprivate reason, under the influence of personal feeling, and with the\r\naccompaniment of but a suspicious orthodoxy. It does certainly look as\r\nif our search after Protestantism in Antiquity would turn out a simple\r\nfailure;--whatever Primitive Christianity was or was not, it was not the\r\nreligion of Luther. I shall think so, until I find Ignatius and Aerius,\r\nin spite of their differences about bishops, agreeing in his doctrine of\r\njustification; until Irenæus and Jovinian, though at daggers drawn about\r\nbaptism, shall yet declare Scripture to be the sole rule of faith; until\r\nCyprian and Vigilantius, however at variance about the merit of\r\nvirginity, uphold in common the sacred right and duty of private\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nAND WHAT DO THE APOSTOLICAL CANONS SAY?\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, is the testimony borne in various ways by Origen, Eusebius,\r\nand Cyril, by Aerius, Jovinian, and Vigilantius, to the immemorial\r\nreception among Christians of those doctrines and practices which the\r\nprivate judgment of this age considers to be unscriptural. I have been\r\ngoing about from one page to another of the records of those early\r\ntimes, prying and extravagating beyond the beaten paths of orthodoxy,\r\nfor the chance of detecting some sort of testimony in favour of our\r\nopponents. With this object I have fallen upon the writers aforesaid;\r\nand, since they have been more or less accused of heterodoxy, I thought\r\nthere was at least a chance of their subserving the cause of\r\nProtestantism, which the Catholic Fathers certainly do not subserve; but\r\nthey, though differing from each other most materially, and some of them\r\ndiffering from the Church, do not any one of them approximate to the\r\ntone or language of the movement of 1517. Every additional instance of\r\nthis kind does but go indirectly to corroborate the testimony of the\r\nCatholic Church.\r\n\r\nIt is natural and becoming in all of us to make a brave struggle for\r\nlife; but I do not think it will avail the Protestant who attempts it in\r\nthe medium of ecclesiastical history. He will find himself in an element\r\nin which he cannot breathe. The problem before him is to draw a line\r\nbetween the periods of purity and alleged corruption, such, as to have\r\nall the Apostles on one side, and all the Fathers on the other; which\r\nmay insinuate and meander through the dove-tailings and inosculations of\r\nhistorical facts, and cut clean between St. John and St Ignatius, St.\r\nPaul and St. Clement; to take up a position within the shelter of the\r\nbook of Acts, yet safe from the range of all other extant documents\r\nbesides, And at any rate, whether he succeeds or not, so much he must\r\ngrant, that if such a system of doctrine as he would now introduce ever\r\nexisted in early times, it has been clean swept away as if by a deluge,\r\nsuddenly, silently, and without memorial; by a deluge coming in a night,\r\nand utterly soaking, rotting, heaving up, and hurrying off every vestige\r\nof what it found in the Church, before cock-crowing; so that \"when they\r\nrose in the morning\" her true seed \"were all dead corpses\"--nay, dead\r\nand buried--and without grave-stone. \"The waters went over them; there\r\nwas not one of them left; they sunk like lead in the mighty waters.\"\r\nStrange antitype, indeed, to the early fortunes of Israel!--then the\r\nenemy was drowned, and \"Israel saw them dead upon the sea-shore.\" But\r\nnow, it would seem, water proceeded as a flood \"out of the serpent's\r\nmouth,\" and covered all the witnesses, so that not even their dead\r\nbodies \"lay in the streets of the great city.\" Let him take which of his\r\ndoctrines he will,--his peculiar view of self-righteousness, of\r\nformality, of superstition; his notion of faith, or of spirituality in\r\nreligious worship; his denial of the virtue of the sacraments, or of the\r\nministerial commission, or of the visible Church; or his doctrine of the\r\ndivine efficacy of the Scriptures as the one appointed instrument of\r\nreligious teaching; and let him consider how far Antiquity, as it has\r\ncome down to us, will countenance him in it. No; he must allow that the\r\nalleged deluge has done its work; yes, and has in turn disappeared\r\nitself; it has been swallowed up in the earth, mercilessly as itself was\r\nmerciless.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\nRepresentations such as these have been met by saying that the extant\r\nrecords of Primitive Christianity are scanty, and that, _for what we\r\nknow_, what is not extant, had it survived, would have told a different\r\ntale. But the hypothesis that history _might_ contain facts which it\r\ndoes _not_ contain, is no positive evidence for the truth of those\r\nfacts; and this is the present question; what is the _positive_ evidence\r\nthat the Church ever believed or taught a Gospel substantially different\r\nfrom that which her extant documents contain? All the evidence that is\r\nextant, be it much or be it little, is on our side: Protestants have\r\nnone. Is none better than some? Scarcity of records--granting for\r\nargument's sake there is scarcity--may be taken to account for\r\nProtestants having no evidence; it will not account for our having some,\r\nfor our having all that is to be had; it cannot become a positive\r\nevidence in their behalf. That records are few, does not show that they\r\nare of none account.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, Protestants had better let alone facts; they are wisest\r\nwhen they maintain that the Apostolic system of the Church was certainly\r\nlost;--lost, when they know not, how they know not, without assignable\r\ninstruments, but by a great revolution lost--of _that_ there can be no\r\ndoubt; and then challenge us to prove it was not so. \"Prove,\" they seem\r\nto say, \"if you can, that the real and very truth is not so entirely hid\r\nin primitive history as to leave not a particle of evidence betraying\r\nit. This is the very thing which misleads you, that all the arguments\r\nare in your favour. Is it not possible that an error has got the place\r\nof the truth, and has destroyed all the evidence but what witnesses on\r\nits side? Is it not possible that all the Churches should everywhere\r\nhave given up and stifled the scheme of doctrine they received from the\r\nApostles, and have substituted another for it? Of course it is; it is\r\nplain to common sense it may be so. Well, we say, what _may be_, _is_;\r\nthis is our great principle: we say that the Apostles considered\r\nepiscopacy an indifferent matter, though Ignatius says it is essential.\r\nWe say that the table is not an altar, though Ignatius says it is. We\r\nsay there is no priest's office under the Gospel, though Clement affirms\r\nit. We say that baptism is not an enlightening, though Justin takes it\r\nfor granted. We say that heresy is scarcely a misfortune, though\r\nIgnatius accounts it a deadly sin; and all this, because it is our\r\nright, and our duty, to interpret Scripture in our own way. We uphold\r\nthe pure unmutilated Scripture; the Bible, and the Bible only, is the\r\nreligion of Protestants; the Bible and our own sense of the Bible. We\r\nclaim a sort of parliamentary privilege to interpret laws in our own\r\nway, and not to suffer an appeal to any court beyond ourselves. We know,\r\nand we view it with consternation, that all Antiquity runs counter to\r\nour interpretation; and therefore, alas, the Church was corrupt from\r\n_very_ early times indeed. But mind, we hold all this in a truly\r\nCatholic spirit, not in bigotry. We allow in others the right of private\r\njudgment, and confess that we, as others, are fallible men. We confess\r\nfacts are against us; we do but claim the liberty of theorizing in spite\r\nof them. Far be it from us to say that we are certainly right; we only\r\nsay that the whole early Church was certainly wrong. We do not impose\r\nour belief on any one; we only say that those who take the contrary\r\nside are Papists, firebrands, persecutors, madmen, zealots, bigots, and\r\nan insult to the nineteenth century.\"\r\n\r\nTo such an argument, I am aware, it avails little to oppose historical\r\nevidence, of whatever kind. It sets out by protesting against all\r\nevidence, however early and consistent, as the testimony of fallible\r\nmen; yet at least, the imagination is affected by an array of facts; and\r\nI am not unwilling to appeal to the imagination of those who refuse to\r\nlet me address their reason. With this view I have been inquiring into\r\ncertain early works, which, or the authors of which, were held in\r\nsuspicion, or even condemned by the ruling authorities of the day, to\r\nsee if any vestige of an hypothetical Protestantism could be discovered\r\nin them; and, since they make no sign, I will now interrogate a very\r\ndifferent class of witnesses. The consent of Fathers is one kind of\r\ntestimony to Apostolical Truth; the protest of heretics is another; now\r\nI will come, thirdly, to received usage. To give an instance of the last\r\nmentioned argument, I shall appeal to the Apostolical Canons, though a\r\nreference to them will involve me in an inquiry, interesting indeed to\r\nthe student, but somewhat dry to the general reader.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\nThese Canons, well known to Antiquity, were at one time supposed to be,\r\nstrictly speaking, Apostolical, and published before A.D. 50. On the\r\nother hand, it has been contended that they are later than A.D. 450, and\r\nthe work of some heretics. Our own divines take a middle course,\r\nconsidering them as published before A.D. 325, having been digested by\r\nCatholic authorities in the course of the two preceding centuries, or at\r\nthe end of the second, and received and used in most parts of\r\nChristendom. This judgment has since been acquiesced in by the\r\ntheological world, so far as this--to suppose the matter and the\r\nenactments of the Canons to be of the highest antiquity, even though the\r\nedition which we possess was not published so early as Bishop Beveridge,\r\nfor instance, supposes. At the same time it is acknowledged by all\r\nparties, that they, as well as some other early documents, have suffered\r\nfrom interpolation, and perhaps by an heretical hand.\r\n\r\nThey are in number eighty-five,[372] of which the first fifty are\r\nconsidered of superior authority to the remaining thirty-five. What has\r\nbeen conjectured to be their origin will explain the distinction. It was\r\nthe custom of the early Church, as is well known, to settle in Council\r\nsuch points in her discipline, ordinances, and worship, as the Apostles\r\nhad not prescribed in Scripture, as the occasion arose, after the\r\npattern of their own proceedings in the fifteenth chapter of the Acts;\r\nand this, as far as might be, after their unwritten directions, or after\r\ntheir practice, or at least, after their mind, or as it is called in\r\nScripture, their \"minding\" or \"spirit.\" Thus she decided upon the\r\nquestion of Easter, upon that of heretical baptism, and the like. And,\r\nafter that same precedent in the Acts, she recorded her decisions in\r\nformal decrees, and \"delivered them for to keep\" through the cities in\r\nwhich her members were found. The Canons in question are supposed to be\r\nsome of these decrees, of which, first and nearest to the Apostles'\r\ntimes, or in the time of their immediate successors, were published\r\nfifty; and in the following age, thirty-five more, which had been\r\nenacted in the interval. They claim, then, to be, first, the recorded\r\njudgment of great portions of the Ante-Nicene Church, chiefly in the\r\neastern provinces, upon certain matters in dispute, and to be of\r\nauthority so far as that Church may be considered a representative of\r\nthe mind of the Apostles; next, they profess to embody in themselves\r\npositive decisions and injunctions of the Apostles, though without\r\nclearly discriminating how much is thus directly Apostolical, and how\r\nmuch not. I will here attempt to state some of the considerations which\r\nshow both their antiquity and their authority, and will afterwards use\r\nthem for the purpose which has led me to mention them.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\n1. In the first place, it would seem quite certain that, as, on the one\r\nhand, Councils were held in the primitive Church, so, on the other,\r\nthose Councils enacted certain Canons. When, then, a Collection presents\r\nitself professing to consist of the Ante-Nicene Canons, there is nothing\r\nat all to startle us; it only professes to set before us that which we\r\nknow anyhow must have existed. We may conjecture, if we please, that the\r\nfact that there were Canons may have suggested and encouraged a\r\ncounterfeit. Certainly; but though the fact that there were Canons will\r\naccount for a counterfeit, it will not account for those original Canons\r\nbeing lost; on the contrary, what is known to have once existed as a\r\nrule of conduct, is likely to continue in existence, except under\r\nparticular circumstances. Which of the two this existing Collection is,\r\nthe genuine or the counterfeit, must depend on other considerations; but\r\nif these considerations be in favour of its genuineness, then this\r\nantecedent probability will be an important confirmation.\r\n\r\nCanons, I say, must have existed, whether these be the real ones or no;\r\nand the circumstance that there were real ones existing must have tended\r\nto make it difficult to substitute others. It would be no easy thing in\r\nour own Church to pass off another set of Articles for the Thirty-nine,\r\nand to obliterate the genuine. Canons are public property, and have to\r\nbe acted upon by large bodies. Accordingly, as might be expected, the\r\nNicene Council, when enacting Canons of its own, refers to certain\r\nCanons as already existing, and speaks of them in that familiar and\r\nindirect way which would be natural under the circumstances, just as we\r\nspeak of our Rubrics or Articles. The Fathers of that Council mention\r\ncertain descriptions of persons whom \"_the Canon_ admits into holy\r\norders;\" they determine that a certain rule shall be in force,\r\n\"according to the Canon which says so and so;\" they speak of a\r\ntransgression of the Canon, and proceed to explain and enforce it. Nor\r\nis the Nicene the only Council which recognizes the existence of certain\r\nCanons, or rules, by which the Church was at that time bound. The\r\nCouncils of Antioch, Gangra, Constantinople, and Carthage, in the same\r\ncentury, do so likewise; so do individual Fathers, Alexander,\r\nAthanasius, Basil, Julius, and others.\r\n\r\nNow here we have lighted upon an important circumstance, whatever\r\nbecomes of the particular Collection of Canons before us. It seems that\r\nat the Nicene Council, only two centuries and a quarter after St. John's\r\ndeath, about the distance of time at which we live from the Hampton\r\nCourt Conference, all Christendom confessed that from time immemorial it\r\nhad been guided by certain ecclesiastical rules, which it considered of\r\nauthority, which it did not ascribe to any particular persons or synods\r\n(a sign of great antiquity), and which writers of the day assigned to\r\nthe Apostles. I suppose we know pretty well, at this day, what the\r\ncustoms of our Church have been since James the First's time, or since\r\nthe Reformation; and if respectable writers at present were to state\r\nsome of them,--for instance, that it is and has been the rule of our\r\nChurch that the king should name the bishops, that Convocation should\r\nnot sit without his leave, or that Easter should be kept according to\r\nthe Roman rule,--we should think foreigners very unreasonable who\r\ndoubted their word. Now, in the case before us, we find the Church\r\nCatholic, the first time it had ever met together since the Apostles'\r\ndays, speaking as a matter of course of the rules to which it had ever\r\nbeen accustomed to defer.\r\n\r\nIf we knew no more than this, and did not know what the rules were; or\r\nif, knowing what they were, we yet decided, as we well might, that the\r\nparticular rules are not of continual obligation; still, the very\r\ncircumstance that there _were_ rules from time immemorial would be a\r\ngreat fact in the history of Christianity. But we do know, from the\r\nworks of the Fathers, the _subjects_ of these Canons, and that to the\r\nnumber of thirty or forty of them; so that we might form a code, as far\r\nas it goes, of primitive discipline, quite independent of the particular\r\nCollection which is under discussion. However, it is remarkable that all\r\nof these thirty or forty are found in this Collection, being altogether\r\nnearly half the whole number, so that the only question is, whether the\r\nrest are of that value which we know belongs to a great proportion of\r\nthem. It is worth noticing, that _no_ Ecclesiastical Canon is mentioned\r\nin the historical documents of the primitive era which is not found in\r\nthis Collection, for it shows that, whoever compiled it, the work was\r\ndone with considerable care. The opponents to its genuineness bring,\r\nindeed, several exceptions, as they wish to consider them; but these\r\nadmit of so satisfactory an explanation as to illustrate the proverb,\r\nthat _exceptio probat regulam_.\r\n\r\nBefore going on to consider the whole Collection, let us see in what\r\nterms the ancient writers speak of those particular Canons to which they\r\nactually refer.\r\n\r\n(1.) Athanasius speaks as follows:--\"Canons and forms,\" he says, when\r\ndescribing the extraordinary violences of the Arians, \"were not given to\r\nthe Churches in this day, but were _handed down_ from our fathers well\r\nand securely. Nor, again, has the faith had its beginning in this day,\r\nbut has passed on even to us from the Lord through His disciples. Rouse\r\nyourselves, then, my brethren, to prevent that from perishing unawares\r\nin the present day _which has been observed in the Churches from ancient\r\ntimes down to us_, and ourselves from incurring a responsibility in what\r\nhas been intrusted to us.\"--_Ep. Encycl._ 1. It is remarkable, in this\r\nextract, that St. Athanasius accurately distinguishes between the Faith\r\nwhich came from Christ, and the Canons received from the Fathers of old\r\ntime: which is just the distinction which our divines are accustomed to\r\nmake.\r\n\r\n(2) Again: the Arians, by simoniacal dealings with the civil power, had\r\nplaced Gregory in the see of Alexandria. Athanasius observes upon\r\nthis:--\"Such conduct is both _a violation of the Ecclesiastical Canons_,\r\nand forces the heathen to blaspheme, as if appointments were made, not\r\nby Divine ordinance, but by merchandise and secular influence.\"--_Ibid._\r\n2.\r\n\r\n(3) Arsenius, bishop of Hypsela, who had been involved in the\r\nMeletian[373] schism, and had acted in a hostile way towards Athanasius,\r\nat length reconciled himself to the Church. In his letter to Athanasius\r\nhe promises \"to be obedient to _the Ecclesiastical Canon_, according to\r\nancient usage, and never to put forth any regulation, whether about\r\nbishops or any other public ecclesiastical matter, without the sanction\r\nof his metropolitan, but to _submit to all the established\r\nCanons_.\"--_Apol. contr. Arian._ 69.\r\n\r\n(4) In like manner, St. Basil, after speaking of certain crimes for\r\nwhich a deacon should be reduced to lay communion, proceeds, \"_for it is\r\nan ancient Canon_, that they who lose their degree should be subjected\r\nto this kind of punishment only.\"--_Ep._ 188. Again: \"_The Canon_\r\naltogether excludes from the ministry those who have been twice\r\nmarried.\"\r\n\r\n(5) When Arius and his abettors were excommunicated by Alexander of\r\nAlexandria, they betook themselves to Palestine, and were re-admitted\r\ninto the Church by the bishops of that country. On this, Alexander\r\nobserves as follows:--\"A very heavy imputation, doubtless, lies upon\r\nsuch of my brethren as have ventured on this act, in that it is _a\r\nviolation of the Apostolical Canon_.\"--_Theod. Hist._ i. 4.\r\n\r\n(6) When Eusebius declined being translated from the see of Cæsarea to\r\nAntioch, Constantine complimented him on his \"observance of the\r\ncommandments of God, _the Apostolical Canon_, and the rule of the\r\nChurch,\"--_Vit. Constant._ iii. 61,--which last seems to mean the\r\nregulation passed at Nicæa.\r\n\r\n(7) In like manner, Julius, bishop of Rome, speaks of a violation of\r\n\"_the Apostles' Canons_;\" and a Council held at Constantinople, A.D.\r\n394, which was attended by Gregory Nyssen, Amphilochius, and Flavian, of\r\na determination of \"_the Apostolical Canons_.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that in some of these instances the Canons are\r\nspoken of in the plural, when the particular infraction which occasions\r\ntheir mention relates only to one of them. This shows they were\r\ncollected into a code, if, indeed, that need be proved; for, in truth,\r\nthat various Canons should exist, and be in force, and yet not be put\r\ntogether, is just as unlikely as that no collection should be made of\r\nthe statutes passed in a session of Parliament.\r\n\r\nWith this historical information about the existence, authority, and\r\nsubject-matter of certain Canons in the Church from time immemorial, we\r\nshould come to many anti-Protestant conclusions, even if the particular\r\ncode we possess turned out to have no intrinsic authority. And now let\r\nus see how the matter stands on this point as regards this code of\r\neighty-five Canons.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.\r\n\r\n2. If this Collection existed _as_ a Collection in the time of the above\r\nwriters and Councils, then, considering they allude to nearly half its\r\nCanons, and that no Canons are anywhere producible which are not in it,\r\nand that they do seem to allude to a Collection, and that no other\r\nCollection is producible, we certainly could not avoid the conclusion\r\nthat they referred to _it_, and that, therefore, in quoting parts of it\r\nthey sanction the whole. If no book is to be accounted genuine except\r\nsuch parts of it as happen to be expressly cited by other writers,--if\r\nit may not be regarded as a whole, and what is actually cited made to\r\nbear up and carry with it what is not cited,--no ancient book extant can\r\nbe proved to be genuine. We believe Virgil's Æneid to be Virgil's,\r\nbecause we know he wrote an Æneid, and because particular passages which\r\nwe find in it, and in no other book, are contained, under the name of\r\nVirgil, in subsequent writers or in criticisms, or in accounts of it. We\r\ndo not divide it into rhapsodies, _because_ it only exists in fragments\r\nin the testimony of later literature. For the same reason, if the\r\nCanons before us can be shown to have existed as one book in\r\nAthanasius's time, it is natural to conceive that they are the very book\r\nto which he and others refer. All depends on this. If the Collection was\r\nmade after his time, of course he referred to some other; but if it\r\nexisted in his time, it is more natural to suppose that there was one\r\nCollection than two distinct ones, so similar, especially since history\r\nis silent about there being two.\r\n\r\nHowever, I conceive it is not worth while to insist upon so early a\r\nformation of the existing Collection. Whether it existed in Athanasius's\r\ntime, or was formed afterwards, and formed by friend or foe, heretic or\r\nCatholic, seems to me immaterial, as I shall by-and-by show. First,\r\nhowever, I will state, as candidly as I can, the arguments for and\r\nagainst its antiquity _as_ a Collection.\r\n\r\nNow there can be no doubt that the early Canons were formed into one\r\nbody; moreover, certain early writers speak of them under the name of\r\n\"the Apostles' Canons,\" and \"Apostolical Canons.\" So far I have already\r\nsaid. Now, certain collectors of Canons, of A.D. (more or less) 550, and\r\nthey no common authorities, also speak of \"the Apostolical Canons,\" and\r\nincorporate them into their own larger collections; and these which they\r\nspeak of are the very body of Canons which we now possess under the\r\nname. We know it, for the digest of these collectors is preserved. No\r\nreason can be assigned why they should not be speaking of the _same_\r\nCollection which Gregory Nyssen and Amphilochius speak of, who lived a\r\ncentury and a half before them; no reason, again, why Nyssen and\r\nAmphilochius should not mean the same as Athanasius and Julius, who\r\nlived fifty to seventy years earlier than themselves. The writers of\r\nA.D. 550 might be just as certain that they and St. Athanasius quoted\r\nthe same work, as we, at this day, that our copy of it is the same as\r\nBeveridge's, Pearson's, or Ussher's.\r\n\r\nThe authorities at the specified date (A.D. 550) are three--Dionysius\r\nExiguus, John of Antioch, patriarch of Constantinople, and the Emperor\r\nJustinian. The learning of Justinian is well known, not to mention that\r\nhe speaks the opinion of the ecclesiastical lawyers of his age. As to\r\nJohn of Antioch and Dionysius, since their names are not so familiar to\r\nmost of us, it may be advisable to say thus much--that John had been a\r\nlawyer, and was well versed both in civil and ecclesiastical\r\nmatters,--hence he has the title of Scholasticus; while Dionysius is the\r\nframer of the Christian era, as we still reckon it. They both made\r\nCollections of the Canons of the Church, the latter in Latin, and they\r\nboth include the Apostolical Canons, as we have them, in their editions;\r\nwith this difference, however (which does not at present concern us),\r\nthat Dionysius published but the first fifty, while John of Antioch\r\nenumerates the whole eighty-five.\r\n\r\nSuch is the main argument for the existence of our Collection at the end\r\nof the third century; viz., that, whereas _a_ Collection of Apostolic\r\nCanons is acknowledged at that date, _this_ Collection is acknowledged\r\nby competent authorities to be that Apostolic record at the end of the\r\nfifth. However, when we inspect the language which Dionysius uses\r\nconcerning them, in his prefatory epistle, we shall find something which\r\nrequires explanation. His words are these, addressed to Stephen, bishop\r\nof Salona:--\"We have, in the first place, translated from the Greek what\r\nare called the Canons of the Apostles; _which, as we wish to apprise\r\nyour holiness, have not gained an easy credit from very many persons_.\r\nAt the same time, some of the decrees of the [Roman] pontiffs, at a\r\nlater date, seem to be taken from these very Canons.\" Here Dionysius\r\nmust only mean, that they were not received as Apostolic; for that they\r\nwere received, or at least nearly half of them, is, as I have said, an\r\nhistorical fact, whatever becomes of the Collection as a Collection. He\r\nmust mean that a claim had been advanced that they were to be received\r\nas part of the apostolic _depositum_; and he must be denying that they\r\nhad more than _ecclesiastical_ authority. The distinction between divine\r\nand ecclesiastical injunctions requires little explanation: the latter\r\nare imposed by the Church for the sake of decency and order, as a matter\r\nof expedience, safety, propriety, or piety. Such is the rule among\r\nourselves, that dissenting teachers conforming must remain silent three\r\nyears before they can be ordained; or that a certain form of prayer\r\nshould be prescribed for universal use in public service. On the other\r\nhand, the appointment of the Sacraments is apostolic and divine. So,\r\nagain, that no one can be a bishop unless consecrated by a bishop, is\r\napostolic; that three bishops are necessary in consecration, is\r\necclesiastical; and, though ordinarily an imperative rule, yet, under\r\ncircumstances, admits of dispensation. Or again, it has, for instance,\r\nin this day been debated whether the sanctification of the Lord's-day is\r\na divine or an ecclesiastical appointment. Dionysius, then, in the above\r\nextract, means nothing more than to deny that the Apostles enacted these\r\nCanons; or, again, that they enacted them _as_ Apostles; and he goes on\r\nto say that the Popes had acknowledged the _ecclesiastical_ authority of\r\nsome of them by embodying them in their decrees. At the same time, his\r\nlanguage certainly seems to show as much as this, and it is confirmed by\r\nthat of other writers, that the Latin Church, though using them\r\nseparately as authority, did not receive them as a Collection with the\r\nimplicit deference which they met with in the East; indeed, the last\r\nthirty-five, though two of them were cited at Nicæa, and one at\r\nConstantinople, A.D. 394, seem to have been in inferior account. The\r\nCanons of the General Councils took their place, and the Decrees of the\r\nPopes.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.\r\n\r\nThis, then, seems to be the state of the case as regards the Collection\r\nor Edition of Canons, whether fifty or eighty-five, which is under\r\nconsideration. Speaking, not of the Canons themselves, but of this\r\nparticular edition of them, I thus conclude about it--that, whether it\r\nwas made at the end of the third century, or later, there is no\r\nsufficient proof that it was strictly of authority; but that it is not\r\nvery material that it should be proved to be of authority, nay, or even\r\nto have been made in early times. Give us the Canons themselves, and we\r\nshall be able to prove the point for which I am adducing them, even\r\nthough they were not at first formed into a collection. They are, one by\r\none, witnesses to us of a state of things.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it must be confessed, that probability is against this\r\nCollection having ever been regarded as an authority by the ancient\r\nChurch. It was an _anonymous_ Collection; and, as being anonymous,\r\nseemed to have no claim upon Christians. They would consider that a\r\ncollection or body of Canons could only be imposed by a _Council_; and\r\nsince the Council could not be produced which imposed this in\r\nparticular, they had no reason to admit it. They might have been in the\r\npractice of acting upon this Canon, and that, and the third, and so on\r\nto the eighty-fifth, from time immemorial, and that as Canons, not as\r\nmere customs, and might confess the obligation of each: and yet might\r\nsay, \"We never looked upon them as a _code_,\" which should be something\r\ncomplete and limited to itself. The true sanction of each was the\r\nimmemorial observance of each, not its place in the Collection, which\r\nimplied a competent framer. Moreover, in proportion as General Councils\r\nwere held, and enacted Canons, so did the vague title of mere usage,\r\nwithout definite sanction, become less influential, and the ancient\r\nCanons fell into disregard. And what made this still more natural was\r\nthe circumstance that the Nicene Council did re-enact a considerable\r\nnumber of those which it found existing. It substituted then a definite\r\nauthority, which, in after ages, would be much more intelligible than\r\nwhat would have by that time become a mere matter of obscure antiquity.\r\nNor did it tend to restore their authority, when their advocates,\r\nfeeling the difficulty of their case, referred the Collection to the\r\nApostles themselves: first, because this assertion could not be\r\nmaintained; next, because, if it could, it would have seemingly deprived\r\nthe Church of the privilege of making Canons. It would have made those\r\nusages divine which had ever been accounted only ecclesiastical. It\r\nwould have raised the question whether, under such circumstances, the\r\nChurch had more right to add to the code of really Apostolic Canons than\r\nto Scripture; discipline, as well as doctrine, would have been given by\r\ndirect revelation, and have been included in the fundamentals of\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nIf, however, all this be so, it follows that we are not at liberty to\r\nargue, from one part of this Collection having been received, that\r\ntherefore every other was also; as if it were one authoritative work. No\r\nnumber of individual Canons being proved to be of the first age will\r\ntend to prove that the remainder are of the same. It is true; and I do\r\nnot think it worth while to contest the point. For argument-sake I will\r\ngrant that the bond, which ties them into one, is not of the most\r\ntrustworthy and authoritative description, and will proceed to show that\r\neven those Canons which are not formally quoted by early writers ought\r\nto be received as the rules of the Ante-Nicene Church, independently of\r\ntheir being found in one compilation.\r\n\r\n\r\n7.\r\n\r\n3. I have already said that nearly half of the Canons, as they stand in\r\nthe Collection, are quoted as Canons by early writers, and thus placed\r\nbeyond all question, as remains of the Ante-Nicene period: the following\r\narguments may be offered in behalf of the rest:--\r\n\r\n(1) They are otherwise known to express _usages_ or _opinions_ of the\r\nAnte-Nicene centuries. The simple question is, whether they had been\r\nreflected on, recognized, converted into principles, enacted, obeyed;\r\nwhether they were the unconscious and unanimous result of the one\r\nChristian spirit[374] in every place, or were formal determinations from\r\nauthority claiming obedience. This being the case, there is very little\r\nworth disputing about; for (whether we regard them as being religious\r\npractices or as religious antiquities) if uniform custom was in favour\r\nof them, it does not matter whether they were enacted or not. If they\r\nwere not, their universal observance is a still greater evidence of\r\ntheir extreme antiquity, which, in that case, can be hardly short of the\r\nApostolic age; and we shall refer to them in the existing Collection,\r\nmerely for the sake of convenience, as being brought together in a short\r\ncompass.\r\n\r\nNay, a still more serious conclusion will follow, from supposing them\r\nnot to be enactments--much more serious than any I am disposed to draw.\r\nIf it be maintained that these observances, though such, did not arise\r\nfrom injunctions on the part of the Church, then, it might be argued,\r\nthe Church has no power over them. As not having imposed, she cannot\r\nabrogate, suspend, or modify them. They must be referred to a higher\r\nsource, even to the inspired Apostles; and their authority is not\r\necclesiastical, but divine. We are almost forced, then, to consider them\r\nas enactments, even when they are not recognized by ancient writers as\r\nsuch, lest we should increase the authority of some of them more than\r\nseems consistent with their subject-matter.\r\n\r\nAgain, if such Canons as are not appealed to by ancient writers are\r\nnevertheless allowed to have been really enacted, on the ground of our\r\nfinding historically that usage corresponds to them; it may so be that\r\nothers, about which the usage is not so clearly known, are real Canons\r\nalso. There is a _chance_ of their being genuine; for why, in drawing\r\nthe line, should we decide by the mere accident of the usage admitting\r\nor not admitting of clear historical proof?\r\n\r\n(2) Again, all these Canons, or at least the first fifty, are composed\r\nin uniform style; there is no reason, as far as the internal evidence\r\ngoes, why one should be more primitive than another, and many, we know,\r\nwere certainly in force as Canons from the earliest times.\r\n\r\n(3) This argument becomes much more cogent when we consider _what_ that\r\nstyle is. It carries with it evident marks of primitive simplicity, some\r\nof which I shall instance. The first remark which would be made on\r\nreading them relates to their brevity, the breadth of the rules which\r\nthey lay down, and their plain and unartificial mode of stating them. An\r\ninstance of this, among others which might be taken, is supplied by a\r\ncomparison of the 7th of them with one of a number of Canons passed at\r\nAntioch by a Council held A. D. 341, and apparently using the\r\nApostolical Canons as a basis for its own. The following, read with the\r\nwords in brackets, agrees, with but slight exceptions, with the\r\nAntiochene Canon, and, without them, with the Apostolical:--\r\n\r\n\"All who come [to church] and hear the [holy] Scriptures read, but do\r\nnot remain to prayer [with the people,] and [refuse] the holy communion\r\n[of the Eucharist, these] must be put out of the Church, as disorderly,\r\n[until, by confession, and by showing fruits of penitence, and by\r\nentreaty, they are able to gain forgiveness.\"]\r\n\r\n(4) Now this contrast, if pursued, will serve to illustrate the\r\nantiquity of the Apostolical Canons in several ways, besides the\r\nevidence deducible from the simplicity of their structure. Thus the word\r\n\"metropolitan\" is introduced into the thirty-fifth Canon of Antioch; no\r\nsuch word occurs in the Apostolical Canon from which it is apparently\r\nformed. There it is simply said, \"the principal bishop;\" or, literally,\r\nthe primus. This accords with the historical fact, that the word\r\nmetropolitan was not introduced till the fourth century. The same remark\r\nmight be made on the word \"province,\" which occurs in the Canon of\r\nAntioch, not in the other. This contrast is strikingly brought out in\r\ntwo other Canons, which correspond in the two Collections. Both treat of\r\nthe possessions of the Church; but the Apostolical Canon says simply,\r\n\"the interests of the Church,\" \"the goods of the Church;\" but the\r\nAntiochene, composed after Christianity had been acknowledged by the\r\ncivil power, speaks of \"the revenue of the Church,\" and \"the produce of\r\nthe land.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, when attempts have been made to show that certain words are\r\ncontained in the Canons before us which were not in use in the\r\nAnte-Nicene times, they have in every case failed in the result, which\r\nsurely may be considered as a positive evidence in favour of their\r\ngenuineness. For instance, the word \"clergy,\" for the ministerial body,\r\nwhich is found in the Apostolical Canons, is also used by Origen,\r\nTertullian, and Cyprian. The word \"reader,\" for an inferior order in the\r\nclergy, is used by Cornelius, bishop of Rome; nay, by Justin Martyr.\r\n\"Altar,\" which is used in the Canons, is the only word used for the\r\nLord's table by St. Cyprian, and, before him, by Tertullian and\r\nIgnatius. \"Sacrifice\" and \"oblation,\" for the consecrated elements,\r\nfound in the Canons, are also found in Clement of Rome, Justin Irenæus,\r\nand Tertullian.\r\n\r\nThis negative evidence of genuineness extends to other points, and\r\nsurely is of no inconsiderable weight. We know how difficult it is so to\r\nword a forgery as to avoid all detection from incongruities of time,\r\nplace, and the like. A forgery, indeed, it is hardly possible to suppose\r\nthis Collection to be, both because great part of it is known to be\r\ngenuine, and because no assignable object would be answered by it; but\r\nlet us imagine the compiler hastily took up with erroneous traditions,\r\nor recent enactments, and joined them to the rest. Is it possible to\r\nconceive, under such circumstances, that there would be no anachronisms\r\nor other means of detection? And if there are none such, and much more\r\nif the compiler, who lived perhaps as early as the fourth century, found\r\nnone such (supposing we may assume him willing and qualified to judge of\r\nthem), nay, if Dionysius Exiguus found none such, what reasons have we\r\nfor denying that they are the produce of those early times to which they\r\nclaim to belong? Yet so it is; neither rite, nor heresy, nor observance,\r\nnor phrase, is found in them which is foreign to the Ante-Nicene\r\nperiod. Indeed, the only reason one or two persons have thrown suspicion\r\non them has been an unwillingness on their part to admit episcopacy,\r\nwhich the Canons assert; a necessity which led the same parties to deny\r\nthe genuineness of St. Ignatius' epistles.[375]\r\n\r\n(5) I will make one more remark:--First, these Canons come to us, not\r\nfrom Rome, but from the East, and were in a great measure neglected, or\r\nat least superseded in the Church, after Constantine's day, especially\r\nin the West, where Rome had sway; these do not embody what are called\r\n\"Romish corruptions.\" Next, there is ground for suspecting that the\r\nCollection or Edition which we have was made by heretics, probably\r\nArians, though they have not meddled with the main contents of them.\r\nThus, while the neglect of them in later times separates them from\r\nRomanism, the assent of the Arians is a second witness, in addition to\r\ntheir recognition by the first centuries, in evidence of their\r\nApostolical origin. Those first centuries observe them; contemporary\r\nheretics respect them; only later and corrupt times pass them by. May\r\nthey not be taken as a fair portrait, as far as they go, of the\r\ndoctrines and customs of Primitive Christianity?\r\n\r\n\r\n8.\r\n\r\nI do wish out-and-out Protestants would seriously lay to heart where\r\nthey stand when they would write a history of Christianity. Are there\r\nany traces of Luther before Luther? Is there anything to show that what\r\nthey call the religion of the Bible was ever professed by any persons,\r\nChristians, Jews, or heathen? Again, are there any traces in history of\r\na process of change in Christian belief and practice, so serious, or so\r\nviolent, as to answer to the notion of a great corruption or perversion\r\nof the Primitive Religion? Was there ever a time, what was the time,\r\nwhen Christianity was not that which Protestants protest against, as if\r\nformal, unspiritual, self-righteous, superstitious, and unevangelic? If\r\nthat time cannot be pointed out, is not \"the Religion of Protestants\" a\r\nmatter, not of past historical fact, but of modern private judgment?\r\nHave they anything to say in defence of their idea of the Christianity\r\nof the first centuries, except that that view of it is necessary to\r\ntheir being Protestants. \"Christians,\" they seem to say, \"_must_ have\r\nbeen in those early times different from what the record of those times\r\nshows them to have been, and they must, as time went on, have fallen\r\nfrom that faith and that worship which they had at first, though history\r\nis quite silent on the subject, _or else_ Protestantism, which is the\r\napple of our eye, is not true. We are driven to hypothetical facts, or\r\nelse we cannot reconcile with each other phenomena so discordant as\r\nthose which are presented by ancient times and our own. We claim to\r\nsubstitute _à priori_ reasoning for historical investigation, by the\r\nright of self-defence and the duty of self-preservation.\"\r\n\r\nI have urged this point in various ways, and now I am showing the light\r\nwhich the Canons of the Apostles throw upon it. There is no reasonable\r\ndoubt that they represent to us, on the whole, and as far as they go,\r\nthe outward face of Christianity in the first centuries;--now will the\r\nProtestant venture to say that he recognizes in it any likeness of his\r\nown Religion? First, let him consider what is conveyed in the very idea\r\nof Ecclesiastical Canons? This: that Christians could not worship\r\naccording to their fancy, but must think and pray by rule, by a set of\r\nrules issuing from a body of men, the Bishops, over whom the laity had\r\nno power whatever. If any men at any time have been priest-ridden, such\r\nwas the condition of those early Christians. And then again, what\r\nbecomes of the Protestant's watchword, \"the Bible, the whole Bible, and\r\nnothing but the Bible,\" if a set of Canons might lawfully be placed upon\r\ntheir shoulders, as if a second rule of faith, to the utter exclusion of\r\nall free-and-easy religion? and what room was there for private\r\njudgment, if they had to obey the bidding of certain fallible men? and\r\nwhat is to be done with the great principle, \"Unity, not Uniformity,\" if\r\nCanons are to be recognized, which command uniformity as well as unity?\r\n\r\nSo much at first sight; but when we go on to examine what these Canons\r\nactually contain, their incompatibility with the fundamental principles\r\nof Protestantism becomes still more patent. I will set down some\r\ninstances in proof of this. Thus, we gather from the Canons the\r\nfollowing facts about Primitive Christianity:--viz., that,\r\n\r\n1. There was a hierarchy of ordained ministers, consisting of the three\r\norders of Bishops, Priests, and Deacons.\r\n\r\n2. Their names were entered on a formal roll or catalogue.\r\n\r\n3. There were inferior orders, such as readers and chanters.\r\n\r\n4. Those who had entered into the sacred orders might not afterwards\r\nmarry.\r\n\r\n5. There were local dioceses, each ruled by a Bishop.\r\n\r\n6. To him and him only was committed the care of souls in his diocese.\r\n\r\n7. Each Bishop confined himself to his own diocese.\r\n\r\n8. No secular influence was allowed to interfere with the appointment of\r\nBishops.\r\n\r\n9. The Bishops formed one legislative body, and met in Council twice a\r\nyear, for the consideration of dogmatic questions and points in\r\ncontroversy.\r\n\r\n10. One of them had the precedence over the rest, and took the lead;\r\nand, as the priests and people in each diocese obeyed their Bishop, so\r\nin more general matters the Bishops deferred to their Primus.\r\n\r\n11. Easter and Pentecost were great feasts, and certain other days\r\nfeasts also. There was a Lent Fast; also a Fast on Easter Eve; and on\r\nWednesdays and Fridays.\r\n\r\n12. The state of celibacy was recognized.\r\n\r\n13. Places of worship were holy.\r\n\r\n14. There was in their churches an altar, and an altar service.\r\n\r\n15. There was a sacrifice in their worship, of which the materials were\r\nbread and wine.\r\n\r\n16. There were oblations also of fruits of the earth, in connection with\r\nthe sacrifice.\r\n\r\n17. There were gold and silver vessels in the rite, and these were\r\nconsecrated.\r\n\r\n18. There were sacred lamps, fed with olive oil, and incense during the\r\nholy rite.\r\n\r\n19. Baptism was administered in the name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.\r\n\r\n20. Excommunication was inflicted on Christians who disgraced their\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\n21. No one might pray, even in private, with excommunicated persons,\r\nexcept at the cost of being excommunicated himself.\r\n\r\n22. No one might pray with heretics, or enter their churches, or\r\nacknowledge their baptism, or priesthood.\r\n\r\n\r\n9.\r\n\r\nThese rules furnish us with large portions, and the more important, of\r\nthe outline of the religion of their times; and are not only definitive\r\nin themselves, but give us the means of completing those parts of it\r\nwhich are not found in them. Considered, then, as a living body, the\r\nprimitive Christian community was distinguished by its high sacerdotal,\r\nceremonial, mystical character. Which among modern religious bodies was\r\nit like? Was it like the Wesleyans? was it like the Society of Friends?\r\nwas it like the Scotch Kirk? was it like any Protestant denomination at\r\nall? Fancy any model Protestant of this day in a state of things so\r\ndifferent from his own! With his religious societies for the Church,\r\nwith his committees, boards, and platforms instead of Bishops, his\r\n_Record_ and _Patriot_ newspapers instead of Councils, his concerts for\r\nprayer instead of anathemas on heresy and schism, his spoutings at\r\npublic meetings for exorcisms, his fourths of October for festivals of\r\nthe Martyrs, his glorious memories for commemorations of the dead, his\r\nniggard vestry allowances for gold and silver vessels, his gas and\r\nstoves for wax and oil, his denunciations of self-righteousness for\r\nfasting and celibacy, and his exercise of private judgment for\r\nsubmission to authority--would he have a chance of finding himself at\r\nhome in a Christianity such as this? is it his own Christianity?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI end, then, as I began:--If Protestantism is another name for\r\nChristianity, then the Martyrs and Bishops of the early Church, the men\r\nwho taught the nations, the men who converted the Roman Empire, had\r\nthemselves to be taught, themselves to be converted. Shall we side with\r\nthe first age of Christianity, or with the last?\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[372] This account is for the most part taken from Bishops Beveridge and\r\nPearson.\r\n\r\n[373] The Egyptian Meletius, from which this schism has its name, must\r\nnot be confounded with Meletius of Antioch.\r\n\r\n[374] The [Greek: ekklêsiastikon phronêma].\r\n\r\n[375] Vid. the parallel case of the Ignatian Epistles in the Author's\r\nEssays, vol. i, p. 266.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE ON P. 366.\r\n\r\n\r\nLately the relics of St. Ambrose have been discovered in his Church at\r\nMilan, as were the relics of St. Gervasius and St. Protasius several\r\nyears since. On this subject I received a month since a letter from a\r\nfriend, who passed through Milan, and saw the sacred remains. I will\r\nquote a portion of his letter to me:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"_Sept. 17, 1872._\r\n\r\n     \"I am amazed at the favour which was shown me yesterday at the\r\n     Church of St. Ambrogio. I was accidentally allowed to be present at\r\n     a private exposition of the relics of St. Ambrose and the Saints\r\n     Gervasius and Protasius. I have seen complete every bone in St.\r\n     Ambrose's body. There were present a great many of the clergy,\r\n     three _medici_, and Father Secchi, who was there on account of his\r\n     great knowledge of the Catacombs, to testify to the age, etc., of\r\n     the remains. It was not quite in chance, for I wanted to go to\r\n     Milan, solely to venerate St. Ambrose once more, and to thank him\r\n     for all the blessings I have had as a Catholic and a Priest, since\r\n     the day that I said Mass over his body. The churches were shut when\r\n     I arrived; so I got up early next morning and went off to the\r\n     Ambrosian. I knelt down before the high altar, and thought of all\r\n     that had happened since you and I were there, twenty-six years ago.\r\n     As I was kneeling, a cleric came out; so I asked him to let me into\r\n     the _scurolo_, which was boarded up all round for repairs. He took\r\n     me there, but he said: 'St. Ambrose is not here; he is above; do\r\n     you wish to see him?' He took me round through the corretti into a\r\n     large room, where, on a large table, surrounded by ecclesiastics\r\n     and medical men, were three skeletons. The two were of immense\r\n     size, and very much alike, and bore the marks of a violent death;\r\n     their age was determined to be about twenty-six years. When I\r\n     entered the room, Father Secchi was examining the marks of\r\n     martyrdom on them. Their throats had been cut with great violence,\r\n     and the neck vertebræ were injured on the inside. The _pomum\r\n     Adami_ had been broken, or was not there; I forget which. This bone\r\n     was quite perfect in St. Ambrose; his body was wholly uninjured;\r\n     the lower jaw (which was broken in one of the two martyrs) was\r\n     wholly uninjured in him, beautifully formed, and every tooth, but\r\n     one molar in the lower jaw, quite perfect and white and regular.\r\n     His face had been long, thin, and oval, with a high arched\r\n     forehead. His bones were nearly white; those of the other two were\r\n     very dark. His fingers long and very delicate; his bones were a\r\n     marked contrast to those of the two martyrs.\r\n\r\n     \"The finding, I was told, was thus:--In the ninth century the\r\n     Bishop of Milan translated the relics of St. Ambrose, which till\r\n     then had laid side by side with the martyrs in one great stone\r\n     coffin of two compartments, St. Gervase being, according to the\r\n     account, nearest to St. Ambrose. He removed St. Ambrose from this\r\n     coffin into the great porphyry urn which we both saw in the\r\n     _scurolo_; leaving the martyrs where they were. In 1864 the\r\n     martyrs' coffin was opened, and one compartment was found empty,\r\n     except a single bone, the right-ankle bone, which lay by itself in\r\n     that empty compartment. This was sent to the Pope as all that\r\n     remained of St. Ambrose; in the other compartment were the two\r\n     skeletons complete. St. Ambrose's urn was not opened till the other\r\n     day, when it was removed from its place for the alterations. The\r\n     bones were found perfect all but the ankle bone. They then sent for\r\n     it to Rome, and the President of the Seminary showed me how it\r\n     fitted exactly in its place, having been separated from it for nine\r\n     centuries.\r\n\r\n     \"The Government seems very desirous to make a handsome restoration\r\n     of the whole chapel, and the new shrine will be completed by May\r\n     next.\"\r\n\r\nThus far my friend's letter.\r\n\r\nI have not been able in such historical works as are at my command to\r\nfind notice of Archbishop Angelbert's transferring St. Ambrose's body\r\nfrom the large coffin of the martyrs to the porphyry urn which has been\r\ntraditionally pointed out as the receptacle of the Saint, and in which\r\nhe was recently found. That the body, however, recently disinterred\r\nactually was once in the coffin of the martyrs is evidenced by its\r\nright-ankle bone being found there. Another curious confirmation arises\r\nfrom my friend's remark about the missing tooth, when compared with the\r\nfollowing passage from Ughelli, Ital. Sacr. t. iv. col. 82:--\r\n\r\n\"Archbishop Angelbert was most devout to the Church of St. Ambrose, and\r\nerected a golden altar in it, at the cost of 30,000 gold pieces. The\r\noccasion of this gift is told us by Galvaneus, among others, in his\r\nCatalogue, when he is speaking of Angelbert. His words are\r\nthese:--'Angelbert was Archbishop for thirty-five years, from A.D. 826,\r\nand out of devotion he extracted a tooth from the mouth of St. Ambrose,\r\nand placed it in his [episcopal] ring. One day the tooth fell out from\r\nthe ring; and, on the Archbishop causing a thorough search to be made\r\nfor it, an old woman appeared to him, saying, \"You will find the tooth\r\nin the place from which you took it.\" On hearing this, the Archbishop\r\nbetook himself to the body of St. Ambrose, and found it in the mouth of\r\nthe blessed Ambrose. Then, to make it impossible for anything in future\r\n[or anything else, de cætero] to be taken from his body, he hid it under\r\nground, and caused to be made the golden altar of St. Ambrose, etc.\r\n\r\nCastellionæus in his Antiquities of Milan (apud Burman. Antiqu. Ital. t.\r\n3, part 1. col. 487) tells us that the Archbishop lost his relic \"as he\r\nwas going in his pontifical vestments to the Church of St. Lawrence on\r\nPalm Sunday. He found he had lost it in the way thither, for, on taking\r\noff his gloves, he saw it was gone.\"\r\n\r\nIt would seem from my friend's letter that either the Archbishop took\r\naway the tooth a second time, or the miracle of its restoration did not\r\ntake place.\r\n\r\nIt should be added that the place in which Angelbert hid the sacred\r\nrelics was so well known, that in the twelfth century Cardinal Bernard,\r\nBishop of Parma, was allowed to see and venerate them,--Vid. Puricelli's\r\nAmbros. Basil. Descriptio. c. 58 and c. 352, ap. Burman. Thesaur.\r\nAntiqu. Ital. t. 4, part 1.\r\n\r\nThat St. Ambrose was buried in his own church, called even from the time\r\nof his death the \"Ambrosian,\" and the church where he had placed the\r\nbones of the two martyrs, Gervasius and Protasius, by the side of whom\r\nhe proposed to have his own body placed, is plain from his own words and\r\nthose of Paulinus his Secretary.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor the controversy on the subject vid.
