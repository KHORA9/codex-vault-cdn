While serving in his first position in the\r\nLibrary, as a personal assistant to the Librarian, Ainsworth R.\r\nSpofford, Mr. Murray undertook the systematic study of \"the origin and\r\nhistorical growth of the colored race throughout the civilized world,\"\r\nwhich he hoped would result in an encyclopedic history of his race.\r\nAlmost 30 years later, he was chosen by Herbert Putnam, then just\r\nbeginning his career as Librarian, to respond to a request from\r\nFerdinand W. Peck, Commissioner General of the United States to the\r\nParis exposition of 1900, that a collection of books and pamphlets by\r\nAfro-American authors be made a feature of the American exhibit at the\r\nexposition. Within a period of 2 weeks, Mr. Murray prepared a\r\npreliminary list of 223 works written by 152 Negro authors. The purpose\r\nof this list was to aid in securing a copy of \"every book and pamphlet\r\nin existence, by a Negro Author, the same to be used in connection with\r\nthe exhibit of Negro Authorship in the Paris Exposition of 1900, and\r\nlater placed in the Library of Congress.\"\r\n\r\nIt was soon discovered that, owing to Dr. Spofford's foresight, the\r\nLibrary of Congress was \"uncommonly rich in such books and pamphlets,\"\r\nbut \"no little difficulty was encountered then and subsequently in\r\nidentifying them.\" By the time the world exposition at Paris opened in\r\nMay 1900, however, Mr. Murray had located 1,100 titles written by Negro\r\nauthors, of which about 500 were forwarded to the exposition. Thomas J.\r\nCalloway, special agent for the U.S. Commission at the exposition, wrote\r\nthat \"the most creditable showing in the exhibit is by Negro authors\r\ncollected by Mr. Daniel Murray of the library of Congress.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the close of the Paris exposition, Mr. Murray continued to collect\r\nworks by Afro-American, Afro-European, and West Indian authors and to\r\namass a varied collection of Afro-Americana. At his death in 1925, the\r\nlibrary of Congress received by provision of his will a unique\r\ncollection of some \"1,448 volumes and pamphlets, 14 broadsides, and 1\r\nmap, with the idea that it should form part of the material especially\r\nselected by him for exhibit purposes.\" The books that had been sent to\r\nthe Paris exposition were kept together upon their return to the\r\nLibrary. This small collection, along with Mr. Murray's bequest and a\r\nfew volumes presented to the library by Mrs. Anna Murray after her\r\nhusband's death, became the \"Colored Author Collection.\" Many of the\r\ntitles have since been cataloged and added to the general collections.\r\n\r\n_The Preliminary List of Books and Pamphlets by Negro Authors, for Paris\r\nExposition and Library of Congress_ (1900), compiled by Daniel Murray,\r\nappears to have been the first effort on the part of the Library to draw\r\nattention to works by and about Negroes.\r\n\r\nIn 1906 Appleton Prentiss Clark Griffin, chief of the Division of\r\nBibliography, directed the compilation of a _Select List of References\r\non the Negro Question_, published by the library. It contained entries\r\nfor 232 books and 286 periodical articles published during the period\r\n1879-1906. The library also published in the same year a _List of\r\nDiscussions of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments_, which comprised\r\n103 entries. Both bibliographies included titles relating primarily to\r\nNegro suffrage and the Negro in the South and were compiled to \"meet\r\nrequests by letter upon topics of current interest.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1940, for the 75th anniversary of the proclamation of the 13th\r\namendment to the Constitution of the United States, which abolished\r\nslavery, the Library prepared and issued a bibliography of its special\r\nmaterials on the Negro. In connection with this anniversary, the Library\r\nalso mounted an exhibition of books, manuscripts, and works of art and\r\narranged a series of concerts. The festival of music and the exhibits\r\nthat opened on December 18, 1940, vividly presented the contribution of\r\nthe American Negro to American culture.\r\n\r\nWithout question both scholars and the general public are aware that the\r\nLibrary of Congress has extensive holdings on the Negro, not only\r\nprinted books and periodicals but also manuscripts, music, prints,\r\nphotographs, motion pictures, and sound recordings. This awareness is\r\nreflected in the steady flow of requests for bibliographies and other\r\nguides to Negro studies that the Library receives. The factors that\r\nstimulate such requests are rooted in the national--indeed, the\r\nworldwide--interest in the American Negro which recent social and\r\ncultural events in this country have intensified. For many years the\r\nLibrary has responded to this interest by issuing from time to time\r\ntyped lists relating to various aspects of Negro life.\r\n\r\nThe mounting interest in Negro history and culture, manifested\r\nparticularly by the introduction of courses in these subjects in high\r\nschool, college, and university curricula, has given rise to a demand\r\nfor lists of books that can be used to support such studies. The present\r\nbibliography is designed to meet the current needs of students,\r\nteachers, librarians, researchers, and the general public for\r\nintroductory guidance to the study of the Negro in the United States.\r\n\r\nThis bibliography is selective rather than exhaustive. Among the topics\r\ncovered are the urban Negro, relations between the races, discriminatory\r\npractices in all areas, and efforts to obtain political and economic\r\nfreedom, as well as the education and cultural history of the Negro, his\r\nreligious life, the social conditions under which he lives, and his\r\nhistorical past. Included are works depicting the lives of outstanding\r\nNegroes--abolitionists, fugitive slaves, educators, civil rights\r\nleaders, scientists, journalists, religious leaders, artists, athletes,\r\nand literary figures.\r\n\r\nThe selection of many of the titles, especially in the fields of\r\nliterature and history, was based on the frequency of requests for\r\nparticular works in large library collections on the Negro and on their\r\ninclusion in the numerous bibliographies and reading lists now being\r\ncompiled for use in junior colleges, colleges, and universities. In\r\naddition, bibliographic lists and essays appended to such works as _From\r\nSlavery to Freedom_, by John Hope Franklin; _North of Slavery_, by Leon\r\nF. Litwack; _The Burden of Race: a Documentary History of Negro-White\r\nRelations in America_, by Gilbert Osofsky; _The Negro in the Civil War_,\r\nby Benjamin Quarles; _The Black Power Revolt_, edited by Floyd B.\r\nBarbour; and _The Negro in the United States_, by E. Franklin Frazier,\r\nwere consulted. Use was also made of previously published bibliographies\r\nsuch as Monroe Work's _Bibliography of the Negro in Africa and America_\r\nand Erwin A. Salk's _A Layman's Guide to Negro History_.\r\n\r\nWhile some books written especially for children and young people are\r\nincluded, and some of the other publications cited are well adapted to\r\ntheir use, no systematic effort was made to represent material of this\r\ntype. Lists such as Miles M. Jackson's _Bibliography of Negro History &\r\nCulture for Young Readers_ may be used as guides in this field.\r\n\r\nIdentification of writers by race has not been attempted except in the\r\nsection on fiction, which lists only novels and short stories written by\r\nrepresentative Negro authors. While the writings of white novelists are\r\nnot cited, the importance of the treatment of Negro characters and the\r\neducational, moral, and artistic value of works by such authors as\r\nHoward Fast, William Faulkner, Harper Lee, Du Bose Heyward, Julia\r\nPeterkin, Lillian Smith, Harriet Beecher Stowe, T. S. Stribling, and\r\nMark Twain are undisputed. Apart from fiction, the publications of both\r\nwhite and Negro writers are included throughout the bibliography.\r\n\r\nThe compiler gratefully acknowledges the invaluable editorial assistance\r\nof Mary Jane Gibson, assistant head of the Bibliography and Reference\r\nCorrespondence Section, General Reference and Bibliography Division,\r\nLibrary of Congress. Miss Gibson also prepared the index. The compiler\r\nwishes to express her appreciation as well to Ruth S. Freitag, head of\r\nthe Bibliography and Reference Correspondence Section, for helpful\r\nsuggestions and for assistance in indexing and proofreading, and to\r\nRobert H. Land, chief of the General Reference and Bibliography\r\nDivision, for emphasizing the need for the bibliography and offering\r\nencouragement while the work was in progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       Dorothy B.

An index of names and subjects is\r\nprovided.\r\n\r\n_Annotations._ Entries have been given brief annotations where\r\nclarification seemed necessary. Because of the increasing importance for\r\nthe building of library collections of scholarly reprints of long\r\nunavailable classics in Negro literature and history, indication of\r\nreprint editions has been made where possible.\r\n\r\n_Call numbers and location symbols._ Location of items is indicated\r\neither by a Library of Congress call number or location symbol, or, for\r\nmaterial in another library, by the National Union Catalog symbol for\r\nthat library.
