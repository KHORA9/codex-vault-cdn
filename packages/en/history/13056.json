Professor of the History of\r\nGerman Culture, Harvard University.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo man since Luther has been a more complete embodiment of German\r\nnationality than Otto von Bismarck. None has been closer to the German\r\nheart. None has stood more conspicuously for racial aspirations,\r\npassions, ideals.\r\n\r\nIt is the purpose of the present sketch to bring out a few of these\r\naffinities between Bismarck and the German people.\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most obviously Teutonic trait in Bismarck's character is\r\nits martial quality. It would be preposterous, surely, to claim\r\nwarlike distinction as a prerogative of the German race. Russians,\r\nFrenchmen, Englishmen, Americans, undoubtedly, make as good fighters\r\nas Germans. But it is not an exaggeration to say that there is no\r\ncountry in the world where the army is as enlightened or as popular an\r\ninstitution as it is in Germany.\r\n\r\nThe German army is not composed of hirelings of professional fighters\r\nwhose business it is to pick quarrels, no matter with whom. It is, in\r\nthe strictest sense of the word, the people in arms. Among its\r\nofficers there is a large percentage of the intellectual élite of the\r\ncountry; its rank and file embrace every occupation and every class of\r\nsociety, from the scion of royal blood down to the son of the\r\nseamstress. Although it is based upon the unconditional\r\nacceptance of the monarchical creed, nothing is farther removed from\r\nit than the spirit of servility. On the contrary, one of the very\r\nfirst teachings which are inculcated upon the German recruit is that,\r\nin wearing the \"king's coat,\" he is performing a public duty, and that\r\nby performing this duty he is honoring himself. Nor can it be said\r\nthat it is the aim of German military drill to reduce the soldier to a\r\nmere machine, at will to be set in motion or be brought to a\r\nstandstill by his superior. The aim of this drill is rather to give\r\neach soldier increased self-control, mentally no less than bodily; to\r\ndevelop his self-respect; to enlarge his sense of responsibility, as\r\nwell as to teach him the absolute necessity of the subordination of\r\nthe individual to the needs of the whole. The German army, then, is by\r\nno means a lifeless tool that might be used by an unscrupulous and\r\nadventurous despot to gratify his own whims or to wreak his private\r\nvengeance. The German army is, in principle at least, a national\r\nschool of manly virtues, of discipline, of comradeship, of\r\nself-sacrifice, of promptness of action, of tenacity of purpose.\r\nAlthough, probably, the most powerful armament which the world has\r\never seen, it makes for peace rather than for war. Although called\r\nupon to defend the standard of the most imperious dynasty of western\r\nEurope, it contains more of the spirit of true democracy than many a\r\ncity government on this side of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nAll this has to be borne in mind if we wish to judge correctly of\r\nBismarck's military propensities. He has never concealed the fact that\r\nhe felt himself, above all, a soldier. One of his earliest public\r\nutterances was a defense of the Prussian army against the sympathizers\r\nwith the revolution of 1848. His first great political achievement was\r\nthe carrying through, in the early sixties, of King William's army\r\nreform in the face of the most stubborn and virulent opposition of a\r\nparliamentary majority. Never, in the years following the formation of\r\nthe Empire, did his speech in the German Parliament rise to a higher\r\npathos than when he was asserting the military supremacy of the\r\nEmperor, or calling upon the parties to forget their dissensions in\r\nmaintaining the defensive strength of the nation, or showering\r\ncontempt upon liberal deputies who seemed to think that questions of\r\nnational existence could be solved by effusions of academic oratory.\r\nOver and over, during the last decade of his official career, did he\r\ndeclare that the only thing which kept him from throwing aside the\r\nworry and vexation of governmental duties and retiring to the much\r\ncoveted leisure of home and hearth, was the oath of vassal loyalty\r\nconstraining him to stand at his post until his imperial master\r\nreleased him of his own accord. And at the very height of his\r\npolitical triumphs he wrote to his sovereign: \"I have always regretted\r\nthat my talents did not allow me to testify my attachment to the royal\r\nhouse and my enthusiasm for the greatness and glory of the Fatherland\r\nin the front rank of a regiment rather than behind a writing-desk. And\r\neven now, after having been raised by your Majesty to the highest\r\nhonors of a statesman, I cannot altogether repress a feeling of regret\r\nat not having been similarly able to carve out a career for myself as\r\na soldier. Perhaps I should have made a poor general, but if I had\r\nbeen free to follow the bent of my own inclination I would rather have\r\nwon battles for your Majesty than diplomatic campaigns.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems clear that both the defects and the greatness of Bismarck's\r\ncharacter are intimately associated with these military leanings of\r\nhis. He certainly was overbearing; he could tolerate no opposition; he\r\nwas revengeful and unforgiving; he took pleasure in the appeal to\r\nviolence; he easily resorted to measures of repression; he requited\r\ninsults with counter-insults; he had something of that blind _furor\r\nTeutonicus_ which was the terror of the Italian republics in the\r\nMiddle Ages. These are defects of temper which will probably prevent\r\nhis name from ever shining with that serene lustre of international\r\nveneration that has surrounded the memory of a Joseph II. or a\r\nWashington with a kind of impersonal immaculateness. But his\r\ncountrymen, at least, have every reason to condone these defects; for\r\nthey are concomitant results of the military bent of German character,\r\nand they are offset by such transcendent military virtues that we\r\nwould almost welcome them as bringing this colossal figure within the\r\nreach of our own frailties and shortcomings.\r\n\r\nThree of the military qualities that made Bismarck great seem to me to\r\nstand out with particular distinctness: his readiness to take the most\r\ntremendous responsibilities, if he could justify his action by the\r\nworth of the cause for which he made himself responsible; his\r\nmoderation after success was assured; his unflinching submission to\r\nthe dictates of monarchical discipline.\r\n\r\nMoritz Busch has recorded an occurrence, belonging to the autumn of\r\n1877, which most impressively brings before us the tragic grandeur and\r\nthe portentous issues of Bismarck's career. It was twilight at Varzin,\r\nand the Chancellor, as was his wont after dinner, was sitting by the\r\nstove in the large back drawing-room. After having sat silent for a\r\nwhile, gazing straight before him, and feeding the fire now and anon\r\nwith fir-cones, he suddenly began to complain that his political\r\nactivity had brought him but little satisfaction and few friends.\r\nNobody loved him for what he had done. He had never made anybody happy\r\nthereby, he said, not himself, nor his family, nor any one else. Some\r\nof those present would not admit this, and suggested \"that he had made\r\na great nation happy.\" \"But,\" he retorted, \"how many have I made\r\nunhappy! But for me three great wars would not have been fought;\r\neighty thousand men would not have perished; parents, brothers,\r\nsisters, and wives would not have been bereaved and plunged into\r\nmourning.... That matter, however, I have settled with God.\" \"Settled\r\nwith God!\"--an amazing statement, a statement which would seem the\r\nheight of blasphemy if it were not an expression of noblest manliness,\r\nif it did not reveal the soul of a warrior dauntlessly fighting for a\r\ngreat cause, risking for it the existence of a whole country as well\r\nas his own happiness, peace, and salvation, and being ready to submit\r\nthe consequences, whatever they might be, to the tribunal of eternity.\r\nTo say that a man who is willing to take such responsibilities as\r\nthese makes himself thereby an offender against morality appears to me\r\ntantamount to condemning the Alps as obstructions to traffic. A\r\npeople, at any rate, that glories in the achievements of a Luther has\r\nno right to cast a slur upon the motives of a Bismarck.\r\n\r\nWhatever one may think of the worth of the cause for which Bismarck\r\nbattled all his life--the unity and greatness of Germany--it is\r\nimpossible not to admire the policy of moderation and self-restraint\r\npursued by him after every one of his most decisive victories. And\r\nhere again we note in him the peculiarly German military temper.\r\nGerman war-songs do not glorify foreign conquest and brilliant\r\nadventure; they glorify dogged resistance and bitter fight for house\r\nand home, for kith and kin. The German army, composed as it is of\r\nmillions of peaceful citizens, is essentially a weapon of defense. And\r\nit can truly be said that Bismarck, with all his natural\r\naggressiveness and ferocity, was in the main a defender, not a\r\nconqueror. He defended Prussia against the intolerable arrogance and\r\nun-German policy of Austria; he defended Germany against French\r\ninterference in the work of national consolidation; he defended the\r\nprinciple of State sovereignty against the encroachments of the\r\nPapacy; he defended the monarchy against the republicanism of the\r\nLiberals and Socialists; and the supreme aim of his foreign policy\r\nafter the establishment of the German Empire was to guard the peace of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThe third predominant trait of Bismarck's character that stamps him as\r\na soldier--his unquestioning obedience to monarchical discipline--is\r\nso closely bound up with the peculiarly German conceptions of the\r\nfunctions and the Purpose of the State, that it will be better to\r\napproach this Part of his nature from the political instead of the\r\nmilitary side.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nIn no other of the leading countries of the world has the _laissez\r\nfaire_ doctrine had as little influence in political matters as in\r\nGermany. Luther, the fearless champion of religious individualism,\r\nwas, in questions of government, the most pronounced advocate of\r\npaternalism. Kant, the cool dissector of the human intellect, was at\r\nthe same time the most rigid upholder of corporate morality. It was\r\nFichte, the ecstatic proclaimer of the glory of the individual will,\r\nwho wrote this dithyramb on the necessity of the constant surrender of\r\nprivate interests to the common welfare: \"Nothing can live by itself\r\nor for itself; everything lives in the whole; and the whole\r\ncontinually sacrifices itself to itself in order to live anew. This is\r\nthe law of life. Whatever has come to the consciousness of existence\r\nmust fall a victim to the progress of all existence. Only there is a\r\ndifference whether you are dragged to the shambles like a beast with\r\nbandaged eyes, or whether, in full and joyous presentiment of the life\r\nwhich will spring forth from your sacrifice, you offer yourself freely\r\non the altar of eternity.\"\r\n\r\nNot even Plato and Aristotle went so far in the deification of the\r\nState as Hegel. And if Hegel declared that the real office of the\r\nState is not to further individual interests, to protect private\r\nproperty, but to be an embodiment of the organic unity of public life;\r\nif he saw the highest task and the real freedom of the individual in\r\nmaking himself a part of this organic unity of public life, he voiced\r\na sentiment which was fully shared by the leading classes of the\r\nPrussia of his time, and which has since become a part of the\r\npolitical creed of the Socialist masses all over Germany.\r\n\r\nHere we have the moral background of Bismarck's internal policy. His\r\nmonarchism rested not only on his personal allegiance to the\r\nhereditary dynasty, although no medieval knight could have been more\r\nsteadfast in his loyalty to his liege lord than Bismarck was in his\r\nunswerving devotion to the Hohenzollern house. His monarchism\r\nrested above all on the conviction that, under the present\r\nconditions of German political life, no other form of government would\r\ninsure equally well the fulfilment of the moral obligations of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRINCE BISMARCK _From the Painting by Franz von\r\nLenbach_ COURTESY OF MR. HUGO RESINGER NEW YORK]\r\n\r\nHe was by no means blind to the value of parliamentary institutions.\r\nMore than once has he described the English Constitution as the\r\nnecessary outcome and the fit expression of the vital forces of\r\nEnglish society. More than once has he eulogized the sterling\r\npolitical qualities of English landlordism, its respect for the law,\r\nits common sense, its noble devotion to national interests. More than\r\nonce has he deplored the absence in Germany of \"the class which in\r\nEngland is the main support of the State--the class of wealthy and\r\ntherefore conservative gentlemen, independent of material interests,\r\nwhose whole education is directed with a view to their becoming\r\nstatesmen, and whose only aim in life is to take part in public\r\naffairs\"; and the absence of \"a Parliament, like the English,\r\ncontaining two sharply defined parties whereof one forms a sure and\r\nunswerving majority which subjects itself with iron discipline to its\r\nministerial leaders.\" We may regret that Bismarck himself did not do\r\nmore to develop parliamentary discipline; that, indeed, he did\r\neverything in his power to arrest the healthy growth of German party\r\nlife. But it is at least perfectly clear that his reasons for refusing\r\nto allow the German parties a controlling influence in shaping the\r\npolicy of the government were not the result of mere despotic caprice,\r\nbut were founded upon thoroughly German traditions, and upon a\r\nthoroughly sober, though one-sided, view of the present state of\r\nGerman public affairs.\r\n\r\nTo him party government appeared as much of an impossibility as it had\r\nappeared to Hegel. The attempt to establish it would, in his opinion,\r\nhave led to nothing less than chaos. The German parties, as he viewed\r\nthem, represented, not the State, not the nation, but an infinite\r\nvariety of private and class interests--the interests of landholders,\r\ntraders, manufacturers, laborers, politicians, priests, and so on;\r\neach particular set of interests desiring the particular consideration\r\nof the public treasury, and refusing the same amount of consideration\r\nto every other. It seemed highly desirable to him, as it did to Hegel,\r\nthat all these interests should be heard; that they should be\r\nrepresented in a Parliament based upon as wide and liberal a suffrage\r\nas possible. But to intrust any one of these interests with the\r\nfunctions of government would, in his opinion, have been treason to\r\nthe State; it would have been class tyranny of the worst kind.\r\n\r\nThe logical outcome of all this was his conviction of the absolute\r\nnecessity, for Germany, of a strong non-partisan government: a\r\ngovernment which should hold all the conflicting class interests in\r\ncheck and force them into continual compromises with one another; a\r\ngovernment which should be unrestricted by any class prejudices,\r\npledges, or theories, and have no other guiding star than the welfare\r\nof the whole nation. And the only basis for such a government he found\r\nin the Prussian monarchy, with its glorious tradition of military\r\ndiscipline, of benevolent paternalism, and of self-sacrificing\r\ndevotion to national greatness; with its patriotic gentry, its\r\nincorruptible courts, its religious freedom, its enlightened\r\neducational system, its efficient and highly trained civil service. To\r\nbow before such a monarchy, to serve such a State, was indeed\r\nsomething different from submitting to the chance vote of a\r\nparliamentary majority; in this bondage even a Bismarck could find his\r\nhighest freedom.\r\n\r\nFor nearly forty years he bore this bondage; for twenty-eight he stood\r\nin the place nearest to the monarch himself; and not even his enemies\r\ndared to assert that his political conduct was guided by other motives\r\nthan the consideration of public welfare. Indeed, if there is any\r\nphrase for which he, the apparent cynic, the sworn despiser of\r\nphrases, seems to have had a certain weakness, it is the word _salus\r\npublica_. To it he sacrificed his days and his nights; for it he more\r\nthan once risked his life; for it he incurred more hatred and slander\r\nthan perhaps any man of his time; for it he alienated his best\r\nfriends; for it he turned not once or twice, but one might almost say\r\nhabitually, against his own cherished prejudices and convictions. The\r\ncareer of few men shows so many apparent inconsistencies and\r\ncontrasts. One of his earliest speeches in the Prussian Landtag was a\r\nfervent protest against the introduction of civil marriage; yet the\r\ncivil marriage clause in the German constitution is his work. He was\r\nby birth and tradition a believer in the divine right of kings; yet\r\nthe King of Hanover could tell something of the manner in which\r\nBismarck dealt with the divine right of kings if it stood in the way\r\nof German unity. He took pride in belonging to the most feudal\r\naristocracy of western Europe, the Prussian Junkerdom; yet he did more\r\nto uproot feudal privileges than any other German statesman since\r\n1848. He gloried in defying public opinion, and was wont to say that\r\nhe felt doubtful about himself whenever he met with popular applause;\r\nyet he is the founder of the German Parliament, and he founded it on\r\ndirect and universal suffrage. He was the sworn enemy of the Socialist\r\nparty--he attempted to destroy it, root and branch; yet through the\r\nnationalization of railways and the obligatory insurance of workmen he\r\ninfused more Socialism into German legislation than any other\r\nstatesman before him.\r\n\r\nTruly, a man who could thus sacrifice his own wishes and instincts to\r\nthe common good; who could so completely sink his own personality in\r\nthe cause of the nation; who with such matchless courage defended this\r\ncause against attacks from whatever quarter--against court intrigue no\r\nless than against demagogues--such a man had a right to stand above\r\nparties; and he spoke the truth when, some years before leaving\r\noffice, in a moment of gloom and disappointment he wrote under his\r\nportrait, _Patrice inserviendo consumor_.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThere is a strange, but after all perfectly natural, antithesis in\r\nGerman national character. The same people that instinctively believes\r\nin political paternalism, that willingly submits to restrictions of\r\npersonal liberty in matters of State such as no Englishman would ever\r\ntolerate, is more jealous of its independence than perhaps any other\r\nnation in matters pertaining to the intellectual, social, and\r\nreligious life of the individual. It seems as if the very pressure\r\nfrom without had helped to strengthen and enrich the life within.\r\n\r\nNot only all the great men of German thought, from Luther down to the\r\nGrimms and the Humboldts, have been conspicuous for their freedom from\r\nartificial conventions and for the originality and homeliness of their\r\nhuman intercourse; but even the average German official--wedded as he\r\nmay be to his rank or his title, anxious as he may be to preserve an\r\noutward decorum in exact keeping with the precise shade of his public\r\nstatus--is often the most delightfully unconventional, good-natured,\r\nunsophisticated, and even erratic being in the world, as soon as he\r\nhas left the cares of his office behind him. Germany is the classic\r\nland of queer people. It is the land of Quintus Fixlein, Onkel Bräsig,\r\nLeberecht Hühnchen, and the host of _Fliegende Blatter_ worthies; it\r\nis the land of the beer-garden and the Kaffeekranzchen, of the\r\nChristmas-tree and the Whitsuntide merry-making; it is the land of\r\ncountry inns and of student pranks. What more need be said to bring\r\nbefore one's mind the wealth of hearty joyfulness, jolly\r\ngood-fellowship, boisterous frolic, sturdy humor, simple directness,\r\nand genuinely democratic feeling that characterizes social life in\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nAnd still less reason is there for dwelling on the intellectual and\r\nreligious independence of German character. Absence of constraint in\r\nscientific inquiry and religious conduct is indeed the very palladium\r\nof German freedom. Nowhere is higher education so entirely removed\r\nfrom class distinction as in the country where the imperial princes\r\nare sent to the same school with the sons of tradesmen and artisans.\r\nNowhere is there so little religious formalism, coupled with such deep\r\nreligious feeling, as in the country where sermons are preached to\r\nempty benches, while _Tannhauser_ and _Lohengrin, Wallenstein_ and\r\n_Faust_, are listened to with the hush of awe and bated breath by\r\nthousands upon thousands.\r\n\r\nIn all these respects--socially, intellectually, religiously--Bismarck\r\nwas the very incarnation of German character. Although an aristocrat\r\nby birth and bearing, and although, especially during the years of\r\nearly manhood, passionately given over to the aristocratic habits of\r\ndueling, hunting, swaggering and carousing, he was essentially a man\r\nof the people. Nothing was so utterly foreign to him as any form of\r\nlibertinism; even his eccentricities were of the hardy, homespun sort.\r\nHe was absolutely free from social vanity; he detested court\r\nfestivities; he set no store by orders or decorations; the only two\r\namong the innumerable ones conferred upon him which he is said to have\r\nhighly valued were the Prussian order of the Iron Cross, bestowed for\r\npersonal bravery on the battlefield, and the medal for \"rescuing from\r\ndanger\" which he earned in 1842 for having saved his groom from\r\ndrowning by plunging into the water after him.\r\n\r\nAll his instincts were bound up with the soil from which he had\r\nsprung. He passionately loved the North German plain, with its gloomy\r\nmoorlands, its purple heather, its endless wheatfields, its kingly\r\nforests, its gentle lakes, and its superb sweep of sky and clouds.\r\nWriting to his friends when abroad--he traveled very little abroad--he\r\nwas in the habit of describing foreign scenery by comparing it to\r\nfamiliar views and places on his own estates. During sleepless nights\r\nin the Chancellery at Berlin there would often rise before him a\r\nsudden vision of Varzin, his Pomeranian country-seat, \"perfectly\r\ndistinct in the minutest particulars, like a great picture with all\r\nits colors fresh--the green trees, the sunshine on the stems, the blue\r\nsky above. I saw every individual tree.\" Never was he more happy than\r\nwhen alone with nature. \"Saturday,\" he writes to his wife from\r\nFrankfort, \"I drove to Rüdesheim. There I took a boat, rowed out on\r\nthe Rhine, and swam in the moonlight, with nothing but nose and eyes\r\nout of water, as far as the Mäuseturm near Bingen, where the bad\r\nbishop came to his end. It gives one a peculiar dreamy sensation to\r\nfloat thus on a quiet warm night in the water, gently carried down by\r\nthe current, looking above on the heavens studded with moon and stars,\r\nand on each side the banks and wooded hilltops and the battlements of\r\nthe old castles bathed in the moonlight, whilst nothing falls on one's\r\near but the gentle splashing of one's movements. I should like to swim\r\nlike this every evening.\" And what poet has more deeply felt than he\r\nthat vague musical longing which seizes one when far away from human\r\nsounds, by the brook-side or the hill-slope? \"I feel as if I were\r\nlooking out on the mellowing foliage of a fine September day,\" he\r\nwrites again to his wife, \"health and spirits good, but with a soft\r\ntouch of melancholy, a little homesickness, a longing for deep woods\r\nand lakes, for a desert, for yourself and the children, and all this\r\nmixed up with a sunset and Beethoven.\"\r\n\r\nHis domestic affections were by no means limited to those united to\r\nhim by ties of blood; he cherished strong patriarchal feelings for\r\nevery member of his household, past or present. He possessed in a high\r\ndegree the German tenderness for little things. He never forgot a\r\nservice rendered to him, however small. In the midst of the most\r\nengrossing public activity he kept himself informed about the minutest\r\ndetails of the management of his estates, so that his wife could once\r\nlaughingly say that a turnip from his own fields interested him vastly\r\nmore than all the problems of international politics.\r\n\r\nHis humor, also, was entirely of the German stamp. It was boisterous,\r\nrollicking, aggressive, unsparing--of himself as little as of\r\nothers--cynic, immoderate, but never without a touch of good-nature.\r\nHis satire was often crushing, never venomous. His wit was racy and\r\nexuberant never equivocal. Whether he describes his _vis-à-vis_ at a\r\nhotel table, his Excellency So-and-So, as \"one of those figures which\r\nappear to one when he has the nightmare--a fat frog without legs, who\r\nopens his mouth as wide as his shoulders, like a carpet-bag, for each\r\nbit, so that I am obliged to hold tight on by the table from\r\ngiddiness\"; whether he characterizes his colleagues at the Frankfort\r\nBundestag as \"mere caricatures of periwig diplomatists, who at once\r\nput on their official visage if I merely beg of them a light to my\r\ncigar, and who study their words and looks with Regensburg care when\r\nthey ask for the key of the lavatory\"; whether he sums up his\r\nimpression of the excited, emotional manner in which Jules Favre\r\npleaded with him for the peace terms in the words, \"He evidently took\r\nme for a public meeting\"; whether he declined to look at the statue\r\nerected to him at Cologne, because he \"didn't care to see himself\r\nfossilized\"; whether he spoke of the unprecedented popular ovations\r\ngiven to him at his final departure from Berlin as a \"first-class\r\nfuneral\"--there are always the same childlike directness, the same\r\nnaïve impulsiveness, the same bantering earnestness, the same sublime\r\ncontempt for sham and hypocrisy.\r\n\r\nAnd what man has been more truthful in intellectual and religious\r\nmatters? He, the man of iron will, of ferocious temper, was at the\r\nsame time the coolest reasoner, the most unbiased thinker. He\r\nwillingly submitted to the judgment of experts, he cheerfully\r\nacknowledged intellectual talent in others, he took a pride in having\r\nremained a learner all his life, but he hated arrogant amateurishness.\r\nHe was not a church-goer; he declined to be drawn into the circle of\r\nreligious schemers and reactionary fanatics; he would occasionally\r\nspeak in contemptuous terms of \"the creed of court chaplains\"; but,\r\nwriting to his wife of that historic meeting with Napoleon in the\r\nlonely cottage near the battlefield of Sedan, he said: \"A powerful\r\ncontrast with our last meeting in the Tuileries in '67. Our\r\nconversation was a difficult thing, if I wanted to avoid touching on\r\ntopics which could not but affect painfully the man whom God's mighty\r\nhand had cast down.\" And more than once has he given vent to\r\nreflections like these: \"For him who does not believe--as I do from\r\nthe bottom of my heart--that death is a transition from one existence\r\nto another, and that we are justified in holding out to the worst of\r\ncriminals in his dying hour the comforting assurance, _mors janua\r\nvitae_--I say that for him who does not share that conviction the joys\r\nof this life must possess so high a value that I could almost envy him\r\nthe sensations they must procure him.\" Or these: \"Twenty years hence,\r\nor at most thirty, we shall be past the troubles of this life, whilst\r\nour children will have reached our present standpoint, and will\r\ndiscover with astonishment that their existence, but now so brightly\r\nbegun, has turned the corner and is going down hill. Were that to be\r\nthe end of it all, life would not be worth the trouble of dressing and\r\nundressing every day.\"\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nWe have considered a few traits of Bismarck's mental and moral make-up\r\nwhich seem to be closely allied with German national character and\r\ntraditions. But, after all, the personality of a man like Bismarck is\r\nnot exhausted by the qualities which he has in common with his people,\r\nhowever sublimated these qualities may be in him. His innermost life\r\nbelongs to himself alone, or is shared, at most, by the few men of the\r\nworld's history who, like him, tower in splendid solitude above the\r\nwaste of the ages. In the Middle High German _Alexanderlied_ there is\r\nan episode which most impressively brings out the impelling motive of\r\nsuch titanic lives. On one of his expeditions Alexander penetrates\r\ninto the land of Scythian barbarians. These child-like people are so\r\ncontented with their simple, primitive existence that they beseech\r\nAlexander to give them immortality. He answers that this is not in his\r\npower. Surprised, they ask why, then, if he is only a mortal, he is\r\nmaking such a stir in the world. Thereupon he answers: \"The Supreme\r\nPower has ordained us to carry out what is in us. The sea is given\r\nover to the whirlwind to plough it up. As long as life lasts and I am\r\nmaster of my senses, I must bring forth what is in me. What would life\r\nbe if all men in the world were like you?\" These words might have been\r\nspoken by Bismarck. Every word, every act of his public career, gives\r\nus the impression of a man irresistibly driven on by some\r\noverwhelming, mysterious power. He was not an ambitious schemer, like\r\nBeaconsfield or Napoleon; he was not a moral enthusiast like Gladstone\r\nor Cavour. If he had consulted his private tastes and inclinations, he\r\nwould never have wielded the destinies of an empire. Indeed, he often\r\nrebelled against his task; again and again he tried to shake it off;\r\nand the only thing which again and again brought him back to it was\r\nthe feeling, \"I must; I cannot do otherwise.\" If ever there was a man\r\nin whom Fate revealed its moral sovereignty, that man was Bismarck.\r\n\r\nWhither has he gone now? Has he joined his compeers? Is he conversing\r\nin ethereal regions with Alexander, Caesar, Frederick? Is he sweeping\r\nover land and sea in the whirlwind and the thunder-cloud? Or may we\r\nhope that he is still working out the task which, in spite of all the\r\nimperiousness of his nature, was the essence of his earthly life--the\r\ntask of making the Germans a nation of true freemen?\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: From _Glimpses of Modern German Culture_.

LEWIS\r\n\r\n\r\nHôtel de Prusse, Stettin, (Not dated: Written about the end of\r\nDecember, 1846.)\r\n\r\nTO HERR VON PUTTKAMER:\r\n\r\n_Most Honored Sir_.--I begin this communication by indicating its\r\ncontent in the first sentence--it is a request for the highest thing\r\nyou can dispose of in this world, the hand of your daughter. I do not\r\nconceal from myself the fact that I appear presumptuous when I, whom\r\nyou have come to know only recently and through a few meetings, claim\r\nthe strongest proof of confidence which you can give to any man. I\r\nknow, however, that even irrespective of all obstacles in space and\r\ntime which can increase your difficulty in forming an opinion of me,\r\nthrough my own efforts I can never be in a position to give you such\r\nguaranties for the future that they would, from your point of view,\r\njustify intrusting me with an object so precious, unless you\r\nsupplement by trust in God that which trust in human beings cannot\r\nsupply. All that I can do is to give you information about myself with\r\nabsolute candor, so far as I have come to understand myself. It will\r\nbe easy for you to get reports from others in regard to my public\r\nconduct; I content myself, therefore, with an account of what underlay\r\nthat--my inner life, and especially my relations to Christianity. To\r\ndo that I must take a start far back.\r\n\r\nIn earliest childhood I was estranged from my parents' house, and at\r\nno time became entirely at home there again; and my education from the\r\nbeginning was conducted on the assumption that everything is\r\nsubordinate to the cultivation of the intelligence and the early\r\nacquisition of positive sciences.\r\n\r\nAfter a course of religious teaching, irregularly attended and not\r\ncomprehended, I had at the time of my confirmation by Schleiermacher,\r\non my sixteenth birthday no belief other than a bare deism, which was\r\nnot long free from pantheistic elements. It was at about this time\r\nthat I, not through indifference, but after mature consideration,\r\nceased to pray every evening, as I had been in the habit of doing\r\nsince childhood; because prayer seemed inconsistent with my view of\r\nGod's nature; saying to myself: either God himself, being omnipresent,\r\nis the cause of everything--even of every thought and volition of\r\nmine--and so in a sense offers prayers to himself through me, or, if\r\nmy will is independent of God's will, it implies arrogance and a doubt\r\nas to the inflexibility as well as the perfection of the divine\r\ndetermination to believe that it can be influenced by human appeals.\r\nWhen not quite seventeen years old I went to Göttingen University.\r\nDuring the next eight years I seldom saw the home of my parents; my\r\nfather indulgently refrained from interference; my mother censured me\r\nfrom far away when I neglected my studies and professional work,\r\nprobably in the conviction that she must leave the rest to guidance\r\nfrom above: with this exception I was literally cut off from the\r\ncounsel and instruction of others. In this period, when studies which\r\nambition at times led me to prosecute zealously--or emptiness and\r\nsatiety, the inevitable companions of my way of living--brought me\r\nnearer to the real meaning of life and eternity, it was in old-world\r\nphilosophies, uncomprehended writings of Hegel, and particularly in\r\nSpinoza's seeming mathematical clearness, that I sought for peace of\r\nmind in that which the human understanding cannot comprehend. But it\r\nwas loneliness that first led me to reflect on these things\r\npersistently, when I went to Kniephof, after my mother's death, five\r\nor six years ago. Though at first my views did not materially change\r\nat Kniephof, yet conscience began to be more audible in the solitude,\r\nand to represent that many a thing was wrong which I had before\r\nregarded as permissible. Yet my struggle for insight was still\r\nconfined to the circle of the understanding, and led me, while reading\r\nsuch writings as those of Strauss, Feuerbach, and Bruno Bauer, only\r\ndeeper into the blind alley of doubt.\r\n\r\nI was firmly convinced that God has denied to man the possibility of\r\ntrue knowledge; that it is presumption to claim to understand the will\r\nand plans of the Lord of the World; that the individual must await in\r\nsubmission the judgment that his Creator will pass upon him in death,\r\nand that the will of God becomes known to us on earth solely through\r\nconscience, which He has given us as a special organ for feeling our\r\nway through the gloom of the world. That I found no peace in these\r\nviews I need not say. Many an hour have I spent in disconsolate\r\ndepression, thinking that my existence and that of others is\r\npurposeless and unprofitable--perchance only a casual product of\r\ncreation, coming and going like dust from rolling wheels.\r\n\r\nAbout four years ago I came into close companionship, for the first\r\ntime since my school-days, with Moritz Blankenburg, and found in him,\r\nwhat I had never had till then in my life, a friend; but the warm zeal\r\nof his love strove in vain to give me by persuasion and discussion\r\nwhat I lacked--faith. But through Moritz I made acquaintance with the\r\nTriglaf family and the social circle around it, and found in it people\r\nwho made me ashamed that, with the scanty light of my understanding, I\r\nhad undertaken to investigate things which such superior intellects\r\naccepted as true and holy with childlike trust. I saw that the members\r\nof this circle were, in their outward life, almost perfect models of\r\nwhat I wished to be. That confidence and peace dwelt in them did not\r\nsurprise me, for I had never doubted that these were companions of\r\nbelief; but belief cannot be had for the asking, and I thought I must\r\nwait submissively to see whether it would come to me. I soon felt at\r\nhome in that circle, and was conscious of a satisfaction that I had\r\nnot before experienced--a family life that included me, almost a home.\r\n\r\nI was meanwhile brought into contact with certain events in which I\r\nwas not an active participant, and which, as other people's secrets, I\r\ncannot communicate to you, but which stirred me deeply. Their\r\npractical result was that the consciousness of the shallowness and\r\nworthlessness of my aim in life became more vivid than ever. Through\r\nthe advice of others, and through my own impulse, I was brought to the\r\npoint of reading the Scriptures more consecutively and with resolute\r\nrestraint, sometimes, of my own judgment. That which stirred within me\r\ncame to life when the news of the fatal illness of our late friend in\r\nCardemin tore the first ardent prayer from my heart, without subtle\r\nquestionings as to its reasonableness. God did not grant my prayer on\r\nthat occasion; neither did He utterly reject it, for I have never\r\nagain lost the capacity to bring my requests to Him, and I feel within\r\nme, if not peace, at least confidence and courage such as I never knew\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nI do not know what value you will attach to this emotion, which my\r\nheart has felt for only two months; I only hope that it may not be\r\nlost, whatever your decision in regard to me may be--a hope of which I\r\ncould give you no better assurance than by undeviating frankness and\r\nloyalty in that which I have now disclosed to you, and to no one else\r\nhitherto, with the conviction that God favors the sincere.\r\n\r\nI refrain from any assurance of my feelings and purposes with\r\nreference to your daughter, for the step I am taking speaks of them\r\nlouder and more eloquently than words can. So, too, no promises for\r\nthe future would be of service to you, since you know the\r\nuntrustworthiness of the human heart better than I, and the only\r\nsecurity I offer for the welfare of your daughter lies in my prayer\r\nfor God's blessing. As a matter of history I would only observe that,\r\nafter I had seen fräulein Johanna repeatedly in Cardemin, after the\r\ntrip we made together this summer, I have only been in doubt as to\r\nwhether the attainment of my desires would be reconcilable with the\r\nhappiness and peace of your daughter, and whether my self-confidence\r\nwas not greater than my ability when I believed that she could find in\r\nme what she would have a right to look for in her husband. Very\r\nrecently, however, together with my reliance on God's grace, the\r\nresolution which I now carry out has also become fixed in me, and I\r\nkept silent when I saw you in Zimmerhausen only because I had more to\r\nsay than I could express in conversation. In view of the importance of\r\nthe matter and the great sacrifice which it will involve for you and\r\nyour wife in separation from your daughter, I can scarcely hope that\r\nyou will give a favorable decision at once, and only beg that you will\r\nnot refuse me an opportunity for explanation upon any considerations\r\nwhich might dispose you to reject my suit, before you utter a positive\r\nrefusal.\r\n\r\nThere is doubtless a great deal that I have not said, or not said\r\nfully enough, in this letter, and I am, of course, ready to give you\r\nexact and faithful information as to everything you may desire to\r\nknow; I think I have told what is most important.\r\n\r\nI beg you to convey to your wife my respectful compliments, and to\r\naccept kindly the assurance of my love and esteem.\r\n\r\nBISMARCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nSchönhausen, February 1, '47.\r\n\r\nI had only waited for daylight to write you, my dear heart, and with\r\nthe light came your little green spirit-lamp to make my lukewarm water\r\nseethe--though this time it found it ready to boil over. Your pity for\r\nmy restless nights at present is premature, but I shall give you\r\ncredit for it. The Elbe still lies turbid and growling in her\r\nice-bonds: the spring's summons to burst them is not yet loud enough\r\nfor her. I say to the weather: \"If you would only be cold or warm! But\r\nyou stay continually at freezing-point, and at this rate the matter\r\nmay long drag on.\" For the present my activity is limited to sending\r\nout, far and wide, from the warm seat at the writing-table, diverse\r\nconjurations, whose magic starts quantities of fascines, boards,\r\nwheelbarrows, etc., from inland towards the Elbe, perchance to serve\r\nas a prosaic dam in restraint of the poetical foaming of the flood.\r\nAfter I had spent the morning in this useful rather than agreeable\r\ncorrespondence, my resolve was to chat away comfortably through the\r\nevening with you, beloved one, as though we were sitting on the sofa\r\nin the red drawing-room; and with sympathetic attention to my desire\r\nthe mail kept for my enjoyment precisely at this gossiping hour your\r\nletter, which I should have received by good rights day before\r\nyesterday. You know, if you were able to decipher my inexcusably\r\nscrawled note [3] from Schlawe, how I struck a half-drunken crowd of\r\nhussar officers there, who disturbed me in my writing. In the train\r\nI had, with my usual bad luck, a lady _vis-à-vis,_ and beside me two\r\nvery stout, heavily fur-clad passengers, the nearer of whom was a\r\ndirect descendant of Abraham into the bargain, and put me in a bitter\r\nhumor against all his race by a disagreeable movement of his left\r\nelbow.\r\n\r\nI found my brother in his dressing-gown, and he employed the five\r\nminutes of our interview very completely, according to his habit, in\r\nemptying a woolsack full of vexatious news about Kniephof before me:\r\ndisorderly inspectors, a lot of damaged sheep, distillers drunk every\r\nday, thoroughbred colts (the prettiest, of course) come to grief, and\r\nrotten potatoes, fell in a rolling torrent from his obligingly opened\r\nmouth upon my somewhat travel-worn self. On my brother's account I\r\nmust affect and utter some exclamations of terror and complaint, for\r\nmy indifferent manner on receiving news of misfortune vexes him, and\r\nas long as I do not express surprise he has ever new and still worse\r\nnews in stock. This time he attained his object, at least in my inner\r\nman, and when I took my seat next to the Jewish elbow in green fur I\r\nwas in a right bad humor; especially the colt distressed me--an animal\r\nas pretty as a picture and three years old.\r\n\r\nNot before getting out of doors did I become conscious of the\r\ningratitude of my heart, and the thought of the unmerited happiness\r\nthat had become mine a fortnight earlier again won the mastery in me.\r\nIn Stettin I found drinking, gambling friends. William Ramin took\r\noccasion to say, _apropos_ of a remark about reading the Bible, \"Tut!\r\nIn Reinfeld I'd speak like that, too, if I were in your place, but to\r\nbelieve you can impose on your oldest acquaintances is amusing.\" I\r\nfound my sister very well and full of joy about you and me. She wrote\r\nto you, I think, before she received your letter. Arnim is full of\r\nanxiety lest I become \"pious.\" He kept looking at me all the time\r\nearnestly and thoughtfully, with sympathetic concern, as one looks at\r\na dear friend whom one would like to save and yet almost gives up for\r\nlost. I have seldom seen him so tender. Very clever people have a\r\ncurious manner of viewing the world. In the evening (I hope you did\r\nnot write so late) I drank your health in the foaming grape-juice of\r\nSillery, in company with half a dozen Silesian counts, Schaffgotsch\r\nand others, at the Hôtel de Rome, and convinced myself Friday morning\r\nthat the ice on the Elbe was still strong enough to bear my horse's\r\nweight, and that, so far as the freshet was concerned, I might today\r\nbe still at your blue or black side[4] if other current official\r\nengagements had not also claimed my presence. Snow has fallen very\r\nindustriously all day long, and the country is white once more,\r\nwithout severe cold. When I arrived it was all free from snow on this\r\nside of Brandenburg; the air was warm and the people were ploughing;\r\nit was as though I had traveled out of winter into opening spring, and\r\nyet within me the short springtime had changed to winter, for the\r\nnearer I came to Schönhausen the more oppressive I found the thought\r\nof entering upon the old loneliness once more, for who knows how long.\r\nPictures of a wasted past arose in me as though they would banish me\r\nfrom you. I was on the verge of tears, as when, after a school\r\nvacation, I caught sight of Berlin's towers from the train.\r\n\r\nThe comparison of my situation with that in which I was on the 10th,\r\nwhen I traveled the same line in the opposite direction; the\r\nconviction that my solitude was, strictly speaking, voluntary, and\r\nthat I could at any time, albeit through a resolve smacking of\r\ninsubordination and a forty hours' journey, put an end to it, made me\r\nsee once more that my heart is ungrateful, dismayed, and resentful;\r\nfor soon I said to myself, in the comfortable fashion of the accepted\r\nlover, that even here I am no longer lonely, and I was happy in the\r\nconsciousness of being loved by you, my angel, and, in return for the\r\ngift of your love, of belonging to you, not merely in vassalage, but\r\nwith my inmost heart. On reaching the village I felt more distinctly\r\nthan ever before what a beautiful thing it is to have a home--a home\r\nwith which one is identified by birth, memory, and love. The sun shone\r\nbright on the stately houses of the villagers, and their portly\r\ninmates in long coats and the gayly dressed women in short skirts gave\r\nme a much more friendly greeting than usual; on every face there\r\nseemed to be a wish for my happiness, which I invariably converted\r\ninto thanks to you. Gray-haired Bellin's[5] fat face wore a broad\r\nsmile, and the trusty old soul shed tears as he patted me paternally\r\non the back and expressed his satisfaction; his wife, of course, wept\r\nmost violently; even Odin was more demonstrative than usual, and his\r\npaw on my coat-collar proved incontestably that it was muddy weather.\r\nHalf an hour later Miss Breeze was galloping with me on the Elbe,\r\nmanifestly proud to carry your affianced, for never before did she so\r\nscornfully smite the earth with her hoof. Fortunately you cannot\r\njudge, my heart, in what a mood of dreary dulness I used to reenter my\r\nhouse after a journey; what depression overmastered me when the door\r\nof my room yawned at me and the mute furniture in the silent\r\napartments confronted me, bored like myself. The emptiness of my\r\nexistence was never clearer to me than in such moments, until I seized\r\na book--though none of them was sad enough for me--or mechanically\r\nengaged in any routine work.\r\n\r\nMy preference was to come home at night, so that I could go to sleep\r\nimmediately.[6] Ach, Gott!--and now? What a different view I take of\r\neverything--not merely that which concerns you as well, and because it\r\nconcerns you, or will concern you also (although I have been bothering\r\nmyself for two days with the question where your writing-desk will\r\nstand), but my whole view of life is a new one, and I am cheerful and\r\ninterested even in my work on the dike and police matters. This\r\nchange, this new life, I owe, next to God, to you, _ma très chère, mon\r\nadorée Jeanneton_--to you who do not heat me occasionally, like an\r\nalcohol flame, but work in my heart like warming fire. Some one is\r\nknocking.\r\n\r\nVisit from the co-director, who complains of the people who will not\r\npay their school taxes. The man asks me whether my _fiancée_ is tall.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes; rather.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, an acquaintance of mine saw you last summer with several ladies\r\nin the Harz Mountains, and you preferred to converse with the tallest,\r\nthat must have been your _fiancée_.\"\r\n\r\nThe tallest woman in your party was, I fancy, Frau von Mittelstädt.\r\n* * * The Harz! The Harz!\r\n\r\nAfter a thorough consultation with Frau Bellin, I have decided to make\r\nno special changes here for the present, but to wait until we can hear\r\nthe wishes of the lady of the house in the matter, so that we may have\r\nnothing to be sorry for. In six months I hope we shall know what we\r\nhave to do.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible as yet to say anything definite about our next meeting.\r\nJust now it is raining; if that continues the Elbe may be played out in\r\na week or two, and then. * * * Still no news whatever about the Landtag.\r\nMost cordial greetings and assurances of my love to your parents, and\r\nthe former--the latter, too, if you like--to all your cousins, women\r\nfriends, etc. What have you done with Aennchen?[7] My forgetting the\r\nVersin letters disturbs me; I did not mean to make such a bad job of it.\r\nHave they been found Farewell, my treasure, my heart, consolation of my\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nYour faithful BISMARCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother picture, a description of a storm in the Alps, which catches\r\nmy eye as I turn over the pages of the book, and pleases me much:\r\n\r\n  \"The sky is changed, and such a change! O night,\r\n  And storm, and darkness, ye are wondrous strong,\r\n  Yet lovely in your strength, as is the light\r\n  Of a dark eye in woman! Far along\r\n  From peak to peak, the rattling crags among,\r\n  Leaps the live thunder; not from one lone cloud,\r\n  But every mountain now has found a tongue,\r\n  And Jura answers through her misty shroud--\r\n  Back to the joyous Alps, who call to her aloud.\r\n\r\n  And this is in the night:--most glorious night!\r\n  Thou wert not sent for slumber! let me be\r\n  A sharer in thy fierce and fair delight--\r\n  A portion of the tempest and of thee!\r\n  How the lit lake shines, a phosphoric sea,\r\n  And the big rain comes dancing to the earth!\r\n  And now again 'tis black, and now the glee\r\n  Of the loud hills shakes with its mountain-mirth,\r\n  As if they did rejoice o'er a young earthquake's birth.\"\r\n\r\nOn such a night the suggestion comes uncommonly near to me that I wish\r\nto be _a sharer in the delight, a portion of tempest, of night_;[8]\r\nmounted on a runaway horse, to dash down the cliffs into the falls of\r\nthe Rhine, or something similar. A pleasure of that kind,\r\nunfortunately, one can enjoy but once in this life. There is something\r\nintoxicating in nocturnal storms. Your nights, dearest, I hope you\r\nregard, however, as _sent for slumber, not for writing_.[9] I see with\r\nregret that I write English still more illegibly than German. Once\r\nmore, farewell, my heart. Tomorrow noon I am invited to be the guest\r\nof Frau Brauchitsch, presumably so that I may be duly and thoroughly\r\nquestioned about you and yours. I'll tell them as much as I please.\r\n_Je t'embrasse mille fois._\r\n\r\nYour own\r\n\r\nB.\r\n\r\n\r\nSchönhausen, February 7, '47.\r\n\r\n_My Heart_,--Just returned through a wild, drifting snow-storm from an\r\nappointment (which unfortunately was occasioned by the burning out of a\r\npoor family). I have warmed myself at your dear letter; in the twilight,\r\neven, I recognized your \"Right honorable.\" All my limbs are twitching\r\nwith eagerness to be off to Berlin again today, and to characterize the\r\ndikes and floods in terms of the unutterable Poberow[10] dialect. The\r\ninexorable thermometer stands at 2 below freezing-point, accompanied\r\nwith howling wind and large flakes, as though it would soon rain. What\r\nis duty! Compare Falstaff's expressions touching honor. At any rate, I\r\nshall write you straightway, even if I ruin myself in postage, and no\r\nsensible thoughts find their way through the débris of the fire that\r\nstill has possession of my imagination. After reading your last remark I\r\nhave just lit my cigar and stirred the ink. First, like a business-man,\r\nto answer your letter. I begin with a request smacking of the official\r\ndesk--namely, that when you write you will, if you please, expressly\r\nstate what letters you have received from me, giving their dates;\r\notherwise one is uncertain as to the regular forwarding of them, as I am\r\nin doubt whether you have received my first letter, which I wrote the\r\nday of my arrival here, while on a business trip, in Jerichow, if I\r\nmistake not, on very bad paper, Friday, the 29th of January. I am very\r\nthankful that you do not write in the evening, my love, even if I am\r\nmyself to suffer thereby. Every future glance into your gray-blue-black\r\neye with its large pupil will compensate me for possibly delayed or\r\nshortened letters.\r\n\r\nIf I could only dream of you when you do of me! But recently I do not\r\ndream at all--shockingly healthy and prosaic; or does my soul fly to\r\nReinfeld in the night and associate with yours? In that case it can\r\ncertainly not dream here; but it ought to tell about its journey in\r\nthe morning, whereas the wayward thing is as silent about its\r\nnocturnal employments as though it, too, slept like a badger.\r\n\r\nYour reminder of the bore, Fritz, with the letter-pouch transports me\r\nto Reinfeld and makes me long still more eagerly for the time when I\r\ncan once again hug my black Jeannette for my good-morning at the desk.\r\nAbout the letter with the strange address, _evidently_ in a woman's\r\nhand, I should like to tell you a romantic story, but I must destroy\r\nevery illusion with the explanation that it comes from a man who used\r\nto be a friend of mine, who, if I do not mistake, once in Kniephof\r\ntook a copy of an Italian address that I received. Again a curtain\r\nbehind which one fancies there is all the poetry in the world, and\r\nfinds the flattest prose. (I once saw in Aix-la-Chapelle, while\r\nstrolling about the stage, the Princess of Eboli, after I had just\r\nspent my sympathy upon her as she lay overwhelmed and fainting at the\r\nqueen's feet in one of the scenes, eating bread and butter and\r\ncracking bad jokes behind the scenes.) That cousin Woedtke is fond of\r\nme, and that the Versin sausage and letter affair is all right, I am\r\nglad to learn.\r\n\r\nI need not assure you that I have the most heartfelt sympathy for the\r\nsufferings of your good mother; I hope rest and summer will affect her\r\nhealth favorably, and that she will recover after a while, with the\r\njoy of seeing her children happy. When she is here she shall not have\r\nany steps to go up to reach you, and shall live directly next to you.\r\n\r\nWhy do you wear mournful black in dress and heart, my angel?\r\nCultivate the green of hope that today made right joyous revelry in me\r\nat sight of its external image, when the gardener placed the first\r\nmessengers of spring, hyacinths and crocus, on my window-ledge. _Et\r\ndis-moi donc, pourquoi es-tu paresseuse? Pourquoi ne fais-tu pas de\r\nmusique?_ I fancied you playing _c-dur_ when the hollow, melting wind\r\nhowls through the dry twigs of the lindens, and _d-moll_ when the\r\nsnow-flakes chase in fantastic whirls around the corners of the old\r\ntower, and, after their desperation is spent, cover the graves with\r\ntheir winding-sheet. Oh, were I but Keudell, I'd play now all day\r\nlong, and the tones would bear me over the Oder, Rega, Persante,\r\nWipper--I know not whither. _A propos de paresse_, I am going to\r\npermit myself to make one more request of you, but with a preface.\r\nWhen I ask you for anything I add (do not take it for blasphemy or\r\nmockery) thy will be done--_your_ will, I mean; and I do not love you\r\nless, nor am I vexed with you for a second if you do not fulfil my\r\nrequest. I love you as you are, and as you choose to be. After I have,\r\nby way of preface, said so much with inmost, unadorned truth, without\r\nhypocrisy or flattery, I beg you to pay some attention to French--not\r\nmuch, but somewhat--by reading French things that interest you, and,\r\nwhat is not clear to you, make it clear with the dictionary. If it\r\nbores you, stop it; but, lest it bore you, try it with books that\r\ninterest you, whatever they may be--romances or anything else. I do\r\nnot know your mother's views on such reading, but in my opinion there\r\nis nothing that you cannot read to yourself. I do not ask this for my\r\nown sake, for we will understand each other in our mother tongue, but\r\nin your intercourse with the world you will not seldom find occasions\r\nwhen it will be disagreeable or even mortifying if you are unfamiliar\r\nwith French. I do not know, indeed, to what degree this is true of\r\nyou, but reading is in any case a way to keep what you have and to\r\nacquire more. If it pleases you, we shall find a way for you to become\r\nmore fluent in talking, than, as you say, you are now. If you do not\r\nlike it, rely with entire confidence on the preface to my request.\r\n\r\nI wrote to poor Moritz yesterday, and, after reading your description\r\nof his sadness, my letter lies like a stone on my conscience, for,\r\nlike a heartless egotist, I mocked his pain by describing my\r\nhappiness, and in five pages did not refer to his mourning by even a\r\nsyllable, speaking of myself again and again, and using him as\r\nfather-confessor. He is an awkward comforter who does not himself feel\r\npain sympathetically, or not vividly enough. My first grief was the\r\npassionate, selfish one at the loss I had sustained; for Marie,[11] so\r\nfar as she is concerned, I do not feel it, because I know that she is\r\nwell provided for, but that my sympathy with the suffering of my\r\nwarmest friend, to whom I owe eternal thanks, is not strong enough to\r\nproduce a word of comfort, of strong consolation from overflowing\r\nfeeling, that burdens me sorely. Weep not, my angel; let your sympathy\r\nbe strong and full of confidence in God; give him real consolation\r\nwith encouragement, not with tears, and, if you can, doubly, for\r\nyourself and for your thankless friend whose heart is just now filled\r\nwith you and has room for nothing else. Are you a withered leaf, a\r\nfaded garment? I will see whether my love can foster the verdure once\r\nmore, can brighten up the colors. You must put forth fresh leaves, and\r\nthe old ones I shall lay between the pages of the book of my heart so\r\nthat we may find them when we read there, as tokens of fond\r\nrecollection. You have fanned to life again the coal that under ashes\r\nand débris still glowed in me; it shall envelop you in life-giving\r\nflames.\r\n\r\n_Le souper est servi_, the evening is gone, and I have done nothing\r\nbut chat with you and smoke: is that not becoming employment for the\r\ndike-captain? Why not?\r\n\r\nA mysterious letter from ---- lies before me. He writes in a tone new\r\nfor him; admits that he perceives that he did many a wrong to his first\r\nwife; did not always rightly guide and bear with her weakness; was no\r\nprop to the \"child,\" and believes himself absolved by this severe\r\ncastigation. _Qu'est-ce qu'il me chante_? Has the letter undergone\r\ntransformation in the Christian climate of Reinfeld, or did it leave the\r\nhand of this once shallow buffoon in its present form? He asserts,\r\nmoreover, that he lives in a never dreamed of happiness with his present\r\nwife, whose acquaintance he made a week before the engagement, and whom\r\nhe married six weeks after the same event: a happiness which his first\r\nmarriage has taught him rightly to prize. Do you know the story of the\r\nFrench tiler who falls from the roof, and, in passing the second story,\r\ncries out, \"_Ça va bien, pourvu que ça dure_?\" Think, only, if we had\r\nbeen betrothed on the 12th of October '44, and, on November 23d, had\r\nmarried: What anxiety for mamma!\r\n\r\nThe English poems of mortal misery trouble me no more now; that was of\r\nold, when I looked out into nothing--cold and stiff, snow-drifts in my\r\nheart. Now a black cat plays with it in the sunshine, as though with a\r\nrolling skein, and I like to see its rolling. I will give you, at the\r\nend of this letter, a few more verses belonging to that period, of\r\nwhich fragmentary copies are still preserved, as I see, in my\r\nportfolio. You may allow me to read them still; they harm me no more.\r\n_Thine eyes have still (and will always have) a charm for me_.[12]\r\nPlease write me in your next letter about the uncertain\r\nmarriage-plans. I believe, _by Jove!_[12] that the matter is becoming\r\nserious. Until the day is fixed, it still seems to me as though we had\r\nbeen dreaming; or have I really passed a fortnight in Reinfeld, and\r\nheld you in these arms of mine? Has Finette been found again? Do you\r\nremember our conversation when we went out with her in leash--when\r\nyou, little rogue, said you would have \"given me the mitten\" had not\r\nGod taken pity on me and permitted me at least a peep through the\r\nkeyhole of His door of mercy! That came into my mind when I was\r\nreading I Cor. vii. 13 and 14 yesterday.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRINCE BISMARCK FRANZ VON LENBACH]\r\n\r\nA commentator says of the passage that, in all relations of life,\r\nChrist regards the kingdom of God as the more powerful, victorious,\r\nfinally overcoming all opposition, and the kingdom of darkness as\r\npowerless, falling in ruins ever more and more. Yet, how do most\r\nof you have so little confidence in your faith, and wrap it carefully\r\nin the cotton of isolation, lest it take cold from any draught of\r\nthe world; while others are vexed with you, and proclaim that you\r\nare people who esteem yourselves too holy to come into contact\r\nwith publicans, etc. If every one should think so who believes he\r\nhas found truth--and many serious, upright, humble seekers do believe\r\nthey find it elsewhere, or in another form--what a Pennsylvania\r\nsolitary-confinement prison would God's beautiful earth become,\r\ndivided up into thousands and thousands of exclusive coteries by\r\ninsuperable partitions! Compare, also, Rom. xiv. 22 and xv. 2; also,\r\nparticularly, I Cor. iv. 5; viii. 2; ix. 20; also xii. 4 and the\r\nfollowing; further, xiii. 2; all in the First Ep. to the Cor., which\r\nseems to me to apply to the subject. We talked, during that walk, or\r\nanother one, a great deal about \"the sanctity of doing good works.\" I\r\nwill not inundate you with Scripture passages in this connection, but\r\nonly tell you how splendid I find the Epistle of James. (Matt. xxv. 34\r\nand following; Rom. ii. 6; II Cor. v. 10; Rom. ii. 13; I Epistle of\r\nJohn iii. 7, and countless others.) It is, indeed, unprofitable to\r\nbase arguments upon separate passages of Scripture apart from their\r\nconnection; but there are many who are honestly striving, and who\r\nattach more importance to passages like James ii. 14 than to Mark xvi.\r\n16, and for the latter passage offer expositions, holding them to be\r\ncorrect, which do not literally agree with yours. To what\r\ninterpretation does the word \"faith\" not lend itself, both when taken\r\nalone and in connection with that which the Scriptures command us \"to\r\nbelieve,\" in every single instance where they employ the word! Against\r\nmy will, I fall into spiritual discussion and controversies. Among\r\nCatholics the Bible is read not at all, or with great precaution, by\r\nthe laity; it is expounded only by the priests, who have concerned\r\nthemselves all their lives with the study of the original sources. In\r\nthe end, all depends upon the interpretation. Concert in Bütow amuses\r\nme: the idea of Bütow is, to my mind, the opposite of all music.\r\n\r\nI have been quite garrulous, have I not? Now I must disturb some\r\ndocument-dust, and sharpen my pen afresh to the police-official style,\r\nfor the president of the provincial court and the government. Could I\r\nbut enclose myself herewith, or go along in a salmon-basket as\r\nmail-matter! Till we meet again, _dearest black one_.[13] I love you,\r\n_c'est tout dire_.\r\n\r\nBISMARCK.\r\n\r\n(I am forgetting the English verses):\r\n\r\n  \"Sad dreams, as when the spirit of our youth\r\n  Returns in sleep, sparkling with all the truth\r\n  And innocence, once ours, and leads us back\r\n  In mournful mockery over the shining track\r\n  Of our young life, and points out every ray\r\n  Of hope and peace we've lost upon the way!\"\r\n\r\nBy Moore, I think; perhaps Byron.\r\n\r\n  \"Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow\r\n  Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,\r\n  To the last syllable of recorded time;\r\n  And all our yesterdays have lighted fools\r\n  The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!\r\n  Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player\r\n  That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,\r\n  And then is heard no more: it is a tale\r\n  Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,\r\n  Signifying nothing.\"\r\n\r\nCordial remembrances to your parents and the Reddentin folk.\r\n\r\n\r\nSchönhausen, February 23, '47.\r\n\r\n_My Angel!_--I shall not send this letter on its way tomorrow, it's\r\ntrue, but I do want to make use of the few unoccupied minutes left me\r\nto satisfy the need I am conscious of every hour, to communicate with\r\nyou, and forthwith to compose a \"Sunday letter\" to you once more.\r\nToday I have been \"on the move\" all day long. \"The Moorish king rode\r\nup and down,\" unfortunately not \"through Granada's royal town,\" but\r\nbetween Havelberg and Jerichow, on foot, in a carriage, and on\r\nhorseback, and got mighty cold doing so--because, after the warm\r\nweather of the last few days, I had not made the slightest preparation\r\nto encounter five degrees below freezing, with a cutting north wind,\r\nand was too much in haste or too lazy to mount the stairs again when I\r\nnoticed the fresh air. During the night it had been quite endurable\r\nand superb moonlight. A beautiful spectacle it was, too, when the\r\ngreat fields of ice first set themselves massively in motion, with\r\nexplosions like cannon-shots, shattering themselves against one\r\nanother; they rear, shoving over and under each other; they pile up\r\nhouse-high, and sometimes build dams obliquely across the Elbe, in\r\nfront of which the pent stream rises until it breaks through them with\r\nrage. Now are they all broken to pieces in the battle--the giants--and\r\nthe water very thickly covered with ice-cakes, the largest of which\r\nmeasure several square rods, which it bears out to the free sea like\r\nshattered chains, with grumbling, clashing noises. This will go on so\r\nfor about three days more, until the ice that comes from Bohemia,\r\nwhich passed the bridge at Dresden several days ago, has gone by. (The\r\ndanger is that the ice-cakes by jamming together may make a dam, and\r\nthe stream rise in front of this--often ten to fifteen feet in a few\r\nhours.) Then comes the freshet from the mountains which floods the bed\r\nof the Elbe, often a mile in width, and is dangerous in itself, owing\r\nto its volume. How long that is to last we cannot tell beforehand. The\r\nprevailing cold weather, combined with the contrary sea wind, will\r\ncertainly retard it. It may easily last so long that it will not be\r\nworth while to go to Reinfeld before the 20th. If only eight days\r\nshould be left me, would you have me undertake it, nevertheless?--or\r\nwill you wait to have me without interruption after the 20th, or\r\nperhaps 18th? It is true that _fiancé_ and dike-captain are almost\r\nincompatible; but were I not the latter, I have not the slightest idea\r\nwho would be. The revenues of the office are small, and the duties\r\nsometimes laborious; the gentlemen of the neighborhood, however, are\r\ndeeply concerned, and yet without public spirit. And even if one\r\nshould be discovered who would undertake it for the sake of the title,\r\nwhich is, strange to say, much desired in these parts, yet there is no\r\none here (may God forgive me the offence) who would not be either\r\nunfit for the business or faint-hearted. A fine opinion, you will\r\nthink, I have of myself, that I only am none of this; but I assert\r\nwith all of my native modesty that I have all these faults in less\r\ndegree than the others in this part of the country--which is, in fact,\r\nnot saying much.\r\n\r\nI have not yet been able to write to Moritz, and yet I must send\r\nsomething to which he can reply, inasmuch as my former letter has not\r\nas yet brought a sign of life. Or have you crowded me out of his\r\nheart, and do you fill it alone? The little pale-faced child is not in\r\ndanger, I hope. That is a possibility in view of which I am terrified\r\nwhenever I think of it--that as a crowning misfortune of our most\r\nafflicted friend, this thread of connection with Marie might be\r\nsevered. But she will soon be a year and a half old, you know; she has\r\npassed the most dangerous period for children. Will you mope and talk\r\nof warm hands and cold love if I pay a visit to Moritz on my next\r\njourney, instead of flying to Reinfeld without a pause as is required\r\nof a loving youth?\r\n\r\nThat you are getting pale, my heart, distresses me. Do you feel well\r\notherwise, physically, and of good courage? Give me a bulletin of your\r\ncondition, your appetite, your sleep. I am surprised also that Hedwig\r\nDewitz has written to you--such a heterogeneous nature, that can have\r\nso little in common with you. She was educated with my sister for\r\nseveral years in Kniephof, although she was four or five years the\r\nelder of the two. Either she loves you--which I should find quite easy\r\nto explain--or has other prosaic intentions. I fancy that she, as is\r\nquite natural, does not feel at home in her father's house; she has,\r\ntherefore, always made her home with others for long periods and with\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nIn your letter which lies before me I come upon \"self-control\" again.\r\nThat is a fine acquisition for one who may profit by it, but surely to\r\nbe distinguished from compulsion. It is praiseworthy and amiable to\r\nwean one's self from tasteless or provoking outbursts of feeling, or\r\nto give to them a more ingratiating form; but I call it\r\nself-constraint--which makes one sick at heart--when one stifles his\r\nown feelings in himself. In social intercourse one may practise it,\r\nbut not we two between ourselves. If there be tares in the field of\r\nour heart, we will mutually exert ourselves so to dispose of them that\r\ntheir seed cannot spring up; but, if it does, we will openly pull it\r\nup, but not cover it artificially with straw and hide it--that harms\r\nthe wheat and does not injure the tares. Your thought was, I take it,\r\nto pull them up unaided, without paining me by the sight of them; but\r\nlet us be in this also one heart and one flesh, even if your little\r\nthistles sometimes prick my fingers. Do not turn your back on them nor\r\nconceal them from me. You will not always take pleasure in my big\r\nthorns, either--so big that I cannot hide them; and we must pull at\r\nthem both together, even though our hands bleed. Moreover, thorns\r\nsometimes bear very lovely flowers, and if yours bear roses we may\r\nperhaps let them alone sometimes. \"The best is foe to the good\"--in\r\ngeneral, a very true saying; so do not have too many misgivings about\r\nall your tares, which I have not yet discovered, and leave at least a\r\nsample of them for me. With this exhortation, so full of unction, I\r\nwill go to sleep, although it has just struck ten, for last night\r\nthere was little of it; the unaccustomed physical exercise has used me\r\nup a bit, and tomorrow I am to be in the saddle again before daylight.\r\nVery, very tired am I, like a child.\r\n\r\n\r\nSchönhausen, March 14, 1847.\r\n\r\n_Jeanne la Méchante!_--What is the meaning of this? A whole week has\r\npassed since I heard a syllable from you, and today I seized the\r\nconfused mass of letters with genuine impatience--seven official\r\ncommunications, a bill, two invitations, one of which is for a theatre\r\nand ball at Greifenberg, but not a trace of Zuckers (the Reinfeld\r\npost-office) and \"Hochwohlgeboren.\" [14] I could not believe my eyes, and\r\nhad to look through the letters twice; then I set my hat quite on my\r\nright ear and took a two hours' walk on the highway in the rain, without\r\na cigar, assailed by the most conflicting sentiments--\"a prey to violent\r\nemotions,\" as we are accustomed to say in romances. I have got used to\r\nreceiving my two letters from you regularly every week, and when once we\r\nhave acquired the habit of a thing we look upon that as our well-won\r\nright, an injury to which enrages us. If I only knew against whom I\r\nshould direct my wrath--against Böge, against the post-office, or\r\nagainst you, _la chatte la plus noire_, inside and out. And why don't\r\nyou write? Are you so exhausted with the effort you made in sending two\r\nletters at a time on Friday of last week? Ten days have gone by since\r\nthen--time enough to rest yourself. Or do you want to let me writhe,\r\nwhile you feast your eyes on my anxiety, tigress! after speaking to me\r\nin your last letters about scarlet and nervous fevers, and after I had\r\nlaid such stress on my maxim of never believing in anything bad before\r\nit forces itself upon me as incontestable? We adhere firmly to our\r\nmaxims only so long as they are not put to the test; when that happens\r\nwe throw them away, as the peasant did his slippers, and run off on the\r\nlegs that nature gave us. If you have the disposition to try the virtue\r\nof my maxims, then I shall never again give utterance to any of them,\r\nlest I be caught lying; for the fact is that I do really feel somewhat\r\nanxious. With fevers in Reddis, to let ten days pass without writing is\r\nvery horrible of you, if you are well. Or can it be that you did not\r\nreceive on Thursday, as usual, my letter that I mailed on Tuesday in\r\nMagdeburg, and, in your indignation at this, resolved not to write to me\r\nfor another week? If _that_ is the state of affairs, I can't yet make up\r\nmy mind whether to scold or laugh at you. The worst of it now is that,\r\nunless some lucky chance brings a letter from you directly to Stolp, I\r\nshall not have any before Thursday, for, as I remember it, there is no\r\nmail leaving you Saturday and Sunday, and I should have received\r\nFriday's today. If you have not sworn off writing altogether and wish to\r\nreply to this letter, address me at Naugard. * * *\r\n\r\nHad another visitor, and he stayed to supper and well into the\r\nnight--my neighbor, the town-counsellor Gärtner. People think they\r\nmust call on each other Sunday evening, and can have nothing else to\r\ndo. Now that all is quiet in the night, I am really quite disturbed\r\nabout you and your silence, and my imagination, or, if not that, then\r\nthe being whom you do not like to have me name, shows me with scornful\r\nzeal pictures of everything that _could_ happen. Johanna, if you were\r\nto fall sick now, it would be terrible beyond description. At the\r\nthought of it, I fully realize how deeply I love you, and how deeply\r\nthe bond that unites us has grown into me. I understand what you call\r\nloving much. When I think of the possibility of separation--and\r\npossible it is still--I should never have been so lonely in all my\r\ndreary, lonely life.\r\n\r\nWhat would Moritz's situation be, compared with that?--for he has a\r\nchild, a father, a sister, dear and intimate friends in the\r\nneighborhood. I have no one within forty miles with whom I should be\r\ntempted to talk more than that which politeness demands; only a\r\nsister--but a happily married one with children is really one no\r\nlonger, at least for a brother who is single. For the first time I am\r\nlooking the possibility straight in the eyes that you might be taken\r\naway from me, that I might be condemned to inhabit these empty rooms\r\nwithout a prospect of your sharing them with me, with not a soul in\r\nall the surrounding region who would not be as indifferent to me as\r\nthough I had never seen him. I should, indeed, not be so devoid to\r\ncomfort in myself as of old, but I should also have lost something\r\nthat I used not to know--a loving and beloved heart, and at the same\r\ntime be separated from all that which used to make life easy in\r\nPomerania through habit and friendship. A very egotistical line of\r\nthought and way of looking at things this discloses, you will say.\r\nCertainly, but Pain and Fear are egotists, and, in cases like that\r\nreferred to, I never think the deceased, but only the survivors, are\r\nto be pitied. But who speaks of dying? All this because you have not\r\nwritten for a week; and then I have the assurance to lecture you for\r\ngloomy forebodings, etc.! If you had only not spoken of the deadly\r\nfevers in your last letter. In the evening I am always excited, in the\r\nloneliness, when I am not tired. Tomorrow, in bright daylight, in the\r\nrailway carriage, I shall perhaps grasp your possible situation with\r\ngreater confidence.\r\n\r\nBe rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation, continuing instant in\r\nprayer. All the angels will guard you, my beloved heart, so that we\r\nshall soon meet again with joy. Farewell, and salute your parents. I\r\nwrote your father this morning. Your faithful BISMARCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nBerlin, Friday, May 15, '47.\r\n\r\n_Dear Heart_,--Your father gave me your letter this morning at the\r\nsession, and in consequence I hardly know what subject was discussed,\r\nor, at least, lacked energy to form a clear, conscious conception of\r\nit. My thoughts were in Reinfeld and my heart full to overflowing of\r\ncare. I am submissive in all that may happen, but I cannot say that I\r\nshould be submissive with gladness. The chords of my soul become\r\nrelaxed and toneless when I think of all possibilities. I am not,\r\nindeed, of that self-afflicting sort that carefully and artfully\r\ndestroys its own hope and constructs fear, and I do not believe that\r\nit is God's will to separate us now--for every reason I cannot believe\r\nit; but I know that you are suffering, and I am not with you, and yet\r\nif I were there, I could perhaps contribute something to your\r\ntranquillity, to your serenity, were it only that I should ride with\r\nyou--for you have no one else for that. It is so contrary to all my\r\nviews of gallantry, not to speak of my sentiments for you, that any\r\npower whatever should keep me here when I know that you are suffering\r\nand I could help and relieve you; and I am still at war with myself to\r\ndetermine what my duty is before God and man. If I am not sooner\r\nthere, then it is fairly certain that I shall arrive in Reinfeld with\r\nyour father at Whitsuntide, probably a week from tomorrow. The cause\r\nof your illness may lie deeper, or perhaps it is only that the odious\r\nSpanish flies have affected you too powerfully. Who is this second\r\ndoctor you have called in? The frequent changing of doctors, and, on\r\none's own authority, using between-times all sorts of household\r\nremedies, or remedies prescribed for others, I consider very bad and\r\nwrong. Choose one of the local doctors in whom you have the most\r\nconfidence, but keep to him, too; do what he prescribes and nothing\r\nelse, nothing arbitrary; and, if you have not confidence in any of the\r\nlocal men, we will both try to carry through the plan of bringing you\r\nhere, so that you may have thorough treatment under the direction of\r\nBreiers, or some one else. The conduct of your parents in regard to\r\nmedical assistance, the obstinate refusal of your father, and, allied\r\nto that, your mother's arbitrary changing and fixed prejudices, in\r\nmatters which neither of them understand, seem to me, between\r\nourselves, indefensible. He to whom God has intrusted a child, and an\r\nonly child at that, must employ for her preservation all the means\r\nthat God has made available, and not become careless of them through\r\nfatalism or self-sufficiency. If writing tires you, ask your mother to\r\nsend us news. Moreover, it would seem to me very desirable if one of\r\nyour friends could be prevailed upon to go to you until you are\r\nbetter. Whether a doctor can help you or not--forgive me, but you\r\ncannot judge of that by your feelings. God's help is certainly\r\ndecisive, but it is just He who has given us medicine and physician\r\nthat, through them, His aid may reach us; and to decline it in this\r\nform is to tempt Him, as though the sailor at sea should deprive\r\nhimself of a helmsman, with the idea that God alone can and will give\r\naid. If He does _not_ help us through the means He has placed within\r\nour reach, then there is nothing left to do but to bow in silence\r\nunder His hand. If you should be able to come to Zimmerhausen after\r\nWhitsuntide, please write to that effect beforehand if possible. If\r\nyour illness should become more serious, I shall certainly leave the\r\nLandtag, and even if you are confined to your bed I shall be with you.\r\nAt such a moment I shall not let myself be restrained by such\r\nquestions of etiquette--that is my fixed resolve. You may be sure of\r\nthis, that I have long been helping you pray that the Lord may free\r\nyou from useless despondency and bestow upon you a heart cheerful and\r\nsubmissive to God--and upon me, also; and I have the firm confidence\r\nthat He will grant our requests and guide us both in the paths that\r\nlead to Him. Even though yours may often go to the left around the\r\nmountain, and mine to the right, yet they will meet beyond.\r\n\r\nThe salt water has already gone from here. If you are too weak for\r\nriding, then take a drive every day. When you are writing to me, and\r\nbegin to feel badly in the least, stop immediately; give me only a\r\nshort bulletin of your health, even if it is but three lines, for,\r\nthank Heaven, words can be dispensed with between us--they cannot add\r\nor take away anything, since our hearts look into each other, eye to\r\neye, to the very bottom, and though here and there, behind a fold,\r\nsome new thing is discovered, a strange thing it is not. Dear heart,\r\nwhat stuff you talk (excuse my rudeness) when you say I must not come\r\nif I would rather stop in Zimmerhausen or Angermünde at Whitsuntide!\r\nHow can I take pleasure anywhere while I know that you are suffering,\r\nand moreover, am uncertain in what degree? With us two it is a\r\nquestion, not of amusing and entertaining, but only of loving and\r\nbeing together, spiritually, and, if possible, corporeally; and if you\r\nshould lie speechless for four weeks--sleep, or something else--I\r\nwould be nowhere else, provided nothing but my wish were to decide. If\r\nI could only \"come to your door,\" I would still rather be there than\r\nwith my dear sister; and the sadder and sicker you are, so much the\r\nmore. But the door will not separate me from you, however ill you may\r\nbe. That is a situation in which the slave mutinies against his\r\nmistress. * * *\r\n\r\nYour faithful B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBerlin, Tuesday Morning, May 18, '47.\r\n\r\n_Dearest_,--The last letters from Reinfeld permit me to hope that your\r\nillness is not so threatening at the moment as I feared from the first\r\nnews, although I am continually beset by all possible fears about you,\r\nand thus am in a condition of rather complicated restlessness. * * *\r\nMy letter in which I told you of my election you have understood\r\nsomewhat, and your dear mother altogether, from a point of view\r\ndiffering from that which was intended. I only wanted to make my\r\nposition exactly clear to you, and the apologies which to you seemed\r\nperhaps forced, as I infer from your mother's letter, you may regard\r\nas an entirely natural outflow of politeness. That I did not stand in\r\nneed of justification with you I very well know; but also that it must\r\naffect us both painfully to see our fine plans cancelled. It was my\r\nardent wish to be a member of the Landtag; but that the Landtag and\r\nyou are fifty miles apart distressed me in spite of the fulfilment of\r\nmy wish. You women are, and always will be, unaccountable, and it is\r\nbetter to deal with you by word of mouth than by writing. * * * I have\r\nventured once or twice on the speaker's platform with a few words, and\r\nyesterday raised an unheard-of storm of displeasure, in that, by a\r\nremark which was not explained clearly enough touching the character\r\nof the popular uprising of 1813, I wounded the mistaken vanity of many\r\nof my own party, and naturally had all the halloo of the opposition\r\nagainst me. The resentment was great, perhaps for the very reason that\r\nI told the truth in applying to 1813 the sentence that any one (the\r\nPrussian people) who has been thrashed by another (the French) until\r\nhe defends himself can make no claim of service towards a third person\r\n(our King) for so doing. I was reproached with my youth and all sorts\r\nof other things. Now I must go over before today's session to see\r\nwhether, in printing my words, they have not turned them into\r\nnonsense. * * *\r\n\r\nYours forever, B.\r\n\r\n\r\nBerlin, Friday, May 21, '47.\r\n\r\n_Très chère Jeanneton_,--When you receive this letter you will know\r\nthat I am not to visit you in the holidays. I shall not offer\r\n\"apologies,\" but reasons why it is not to be. I should miss certainly\r\nfour, and probably five, meetings of the estates, and, according to\r\nthe announcement we have received, the most important proceedings are\r\nto be expected at the coming meetings. There it may depend upon one\r\nvote, and it would be a bad thing if that were the vote of an\r\nabsentee; moreover, I have succeeded in acquiring some influence with\r\na great number, or, at least, with some delegates of the so-called\r\ncourt party and the other ultra-conservatives from several provinces,\r\nwhich I employ in restraining them so far as possible from bolting and\r\nawkward shying, which I can do in the most unsuspected fashion when\r\nonce I have plainly expressed my inclination. Then, too, I have some\r\nmoney affairs to arrange, for which I must make use of one of the\r\nholidays. The Landtag will either be brought to a close on the 7th of\r\nJune--and in that case I should stay here until that date--or it will\r\ncontinue in session until all the matters have been arranged, in which\r\nevent I should stay till after the decision of the important political\r\nquestions which are now imminent and shall be less conscientious about\r\nall the insignificant petitions that follow after, and await their\r\ndiscussion in Reinfeld. It will, besides, be pleasanter for you and\r\nthe mother not to have us both--the father and me--there at one time,\r\nbut relieving each other, so that you may be lonely for a shorter\r\ntime. * * * Your father will tell you how I stirred up the\r\nhornet's-nest of the volunteers here lately, and the angry hornets\r\ncame buzzing to attack me; on the other hand, I had as compensation\r\nthat many of the older and more intelligent people drew near to\r\nme--people I did not know at all--and assured me that I had said\r\nnothing but the truth, and that was the very thing that had so\r\nincensed the people. But I must take the field now; it is ten o'clock.\r\nPlease ask your father to write immediately about your health. I\r\nshould so much like to hear the opinion of another person besides your\r\nmother. I am all right--only much excited. Farewell, and God guard\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nYours altogether and forever, B.\r\n\r\n\r\nBerlin, May 26, '47.\r\n\r\n_Dearest_,-- * * * If I were only through with the Landtag and the\r\ndelivery of Kniephof, could embrace you in health, and retire with you\r\nto a hunting-lodge in the heart of green forest and the mountains,\r\nwhere I should see no human face but yours! That is my hourly dream;\r\nthe rattling wheel-work of political life is more obnoxious to my ears\r\nevery day.--Whether it is your absence, sickness, or my laziness, I\r\nwant to be alone with you in contemplative enthusiasm for nature. It\r\nmay be the spirit of contradiction, which always makes me long for\r\nwhat I have not. And yet, I have you, you know, though not quite at\r\nhand; and still I long for you. I proposed to your father that I\r\nshould go with him; we would immediately have our banns published and\r\nbe married, and both come here. An apartment for married people is\r\nempty in this house, and here you could have had sensible physicians\r\nand every mortal help. It seemed to him too unbecoming. To you, too?\r\nIt seems to me still the most sensible thing of all, if you are only\r\nstrong enough for the trip. If the Landtag should continue longer than\r\nto the 6th of June--which I still hope it will not--let us look at the\r\nplan more carefully. * * *\r\n\r\nYour faithful B.\r\n\r\n\r\nSchönhausen, Friday, May 28, '47.\r\n\r\n_My Poor Sick Kitten_,--  * * * In regard to your illness, your father's\r\nletter has calmed my anxiety somewhat as to the danger, but yours was\r\nso gloomy and depressed that it affected me decidedly. My dear heart,\r\nsuch sadness as finds expression there is almost more than submission\r\nto God's will: the latter cannot, in my opinion, be the cause of your\r\ngiving up the hope, I might say the wish, that you may be better,\r\nphysically, and experience God's blessing here on earth as long as may\r\nbe in accordance with His dispensation. You do not really mean it,\r\neither--do you, now?--when, in a fit of melancholy, you say that\r\nnothing whatever interests you genuinely, and you neither grieve nor\r\nrejoice. That smacks of Byron, rather than of Christianity. You have\r\nbeen sick so often in your life, and have recovered--have experienced\r\nglad and sad hours afterwards; and the old God still lives who helped\r\nyou then. Your letter stirred in me more actively than ever the\r\nlonging to be at your side, to fondle you and talk with you. * * *\r\n\r\nI do not agree with you in your opinion about July, and I would urge\r\nyou strongly, too, on this point to side with me against your parents.\r\nWhen a wife, you are as likely to be sick as when a _fiancée_--and\r\nwill be often enough, later; so why not at the beginning, likewise? I\r\nshall be with you as often as I am free from pressing engagements, so\r\nwhether we are together here or in Reinfeld makes no difference in the\r\nmatter. We do not mean to marry for bright days only: your ill-health\r\nseems to me an utterly frivolous impediment. The provisional situation\r\nwe are now in is the worst possible for me. I scarcely know any longer\r\nwhether I am living in Schönhausen, in Reinfeld, in Berlin, or on the\r\ntrain. If you fall sick, I shall be a sluggard in Reinfeld all the\r\nautumn, or however long our marriage would be postponed, and cannot\r\neven associate with you quite unconstrainedly before the ceremony.\r\nThis matter of a betrothed couple seventy miles apart is not\r\ndefensible; and, especially when I know you are ailing, I shall take\r\nthe journey to see you, of course, as often as my public and private\r\naffairs permit. It seems to me quite necessary to have the ceremony at\r\nthe time already appointed; otherwise I should be much distressed, and\r\nI see no reason for it. Don't sell Brunette just now; you will ride\r\nher again soon. I must be in Berlin at noon for a consultation about\r\nplans for tomorrow. Farewell. God strengthen you for joy and hope.\r\n\r\nYour most faithful B.\r\n\r\n_Tomorrow I'll send you a hat_.[15]\r\n\r\n\r\nBerlin, Sunday, May 30, '47.\r\n\r\n_Très Chère Jeanneton_,--Your letter of day before yesterday, which I\r\nhave just received, has given me profound pleasure and poured into me a\r\nrefreshing and more joyous essence: your happier love of life is shared\r\nby me immediately. I shall begin by reassuring you about your gloomy\r\nforebodings of Thursday evening. At the very time when you were\r\nafflicted by them I was rejoicing in the happiness I had long missed, of\r\nliving once more in a comfortable Schönhaus bed, after I had suffered\r\nfor weeks from the furnished-apartments couch in Berlin. I slept very\r\nsoundly, although with bad dreams--nightmares--which I ascribed to a\r\nlate and heavy dinner, inasmuch as the peaceful occupations of the\r\nprevious day--consisting in viewing many promising crops and well-fed\r\nsheep, together with catching up with all sorts of police arrangements\r\nrelating to dike, fire, and roads--could not have occasioned them. You\r\nsee how little you can depend upon the maternal inheritance of\r\nforebodings. Also in regard to the injurious effects of the Landtag\r\nexcitement upon my health, I can completely reassure you. I have\r\ndiscovered what I needed--physical exercise--to offset mental\r\nexcitement and irregular diet. Yesterday I spent in Potsdam, to be\r\npresent at the water carnival--a lively picture. The great blue basins\r\nof the Havel, with the splendid surroundings of castles, bridges,\r\nchurches, enlivened with several hundred gayly decorated boats, whose\r\noccupants, elegantly dressed gentlemen and ladies, bombard one another\r\nlavishly with bouquets when they can reach each other in passing or\r\ndrawing up alongside. The royal pair, the whole court, Potsdam's\r\nfashionable people, and half of Berlin whirled in the skein of boats\r\nmerrily, pell-mell; royalists and liberals all threw dry or wet flowers\r\nat the neighbor within reach. Three steamboats at anchor, with musical\r\nchoruses, constituted the centre of the ever-changing groups. I had the\r\nopportunity to salute, hurriedly and with surprise, and throw flowers\r\nat, many acquaintances whom I had not seen for a long time. My friend\r\nSchaffgotsch is passionately fond of walking, and he was responsible for\r\nour returning to the railway station on foot--a distance of almost three\r\nmiles--at such a pace as I had not kept up in a long while. After that I\r\nslept splendidly until nine, and am in a state of physical equilibrium\r\ntoday such as I have not enjoyed for some time. As the rather dusty\r\npromenades in the Thiergarten do not give me enough of a shaking-up in\r\nthe time that I have available for that purpose, Mousquetaire will\r\narrive here tomorrow, so that he, with his lively gallop, may play the\r\ncounterpart to the tune that politics is dancing in my head. My plan\r\nabout Berlin and the wedding immediately, etc., was certainly somewhat\r\nadventurous when you look at it in cold blood, but I hope there will be\r\nno change from July. If I am to be tormented, as you say, with an\r\n\"unendurable, dispirited, nervous being,\" it is all the same in the end\r\nwhether this torment will be imposed upon me by my _fiancée_ or--forgive\r\nthe expression--by my wife. In either case I shall try to bear the\r\nmisfortune with philosophical steadfastness; for it is to be hoped that\r\nit will not be so bad that I must dig deeper and seek Christian\r\nconsolation for it.\r\n\r\nYour very faithful B.\r\n\r\n\r\nBerlin, July 4, '47.\r\n\r\n_Juaninina_,--Happily, I have left Schönhausen behind me, and do not\r\nexpect to enter it again without you, _mon ange._ Only some business\r\nmatters detain me here, which I cannot attend to today because it is\r\nSunday; but I confidently anticipate starting for Angermünde tomorrow\r\nat four, and accordingly, unless the very improbable event occurs that\r\nI am detained outrageously in Kniephof, shall arrive in Schlawe on\r\nThursday. * * * Farewell, my heart. This is probably the last\r\npost-marked paper that you will receive from your _Bräutigam_[16] (I\r\nhate the expression). Our banns were cried today for the first time in\r\nSchönhausen. Does that not seem strange to you But I had learned your\r\ngiven names so badly that I could mention only Johanna Eleonore: the\r\nother six you must teach me better. Farewell, my heart. Many\r\nsalutations to the parents.\r\n\r\nYour very faithful B.\r\n\r\n_My Dear_,--I believe I can now reassure you most completely as to the\r\nsafety of the members of the Landtag. The Landtag was opened today,\r\n_minus_ King and _minus_ cheers, with quite calm discussion. In a\r\nfew words I uttered my protest against the thanks and exultation that\r\nwere voted to the King, without hostilities becoming overt. Ten\r\nthousand men of the city militia were posted for our protection, but\r\nnot even a slight disturbance occurred at the palace. I could be with\r\nyou tomorrow, as there is no session, if I had ordered a carriage\r\nto meet me at Genthin this evening. But as the whole affair apparently\r\nwill come to an end this week, perhaps as early as Thursday, I was\r\ntoo stingy to hire a carriage. Brauchitsch was taken violently ill\r\nagain last evening. * * * Give cordial remembrances to your mother, and\r\nbe of good courage. I am much calmer than I was: with Vincke one heart\r\nand one soul.\r\n\r\nYour faithful B.\r\n\r\nApril 2, '48, Sunday Evening.\r\n\r\nI fear, my dear heart, the letter I wrote you last evening reached the\r\npost-office so late, through an oversight, that you will not receive\r\nit today, and not before tomorrow with this; and it pains me to think\r\nthat you were disappointed in your hope when the mail was delivered,\r\nand now (9 o'clock in the evening) are perhaps troubled with\r\ndisquietude of all sorts about me. I have spent a tiresome day,\r\ntramping the pavement, smoking and intriguing. Do not judge of the few\r\nwords I spoke yesterday from the report in the Berlin _Times_. I shall\r\nmanage to bring you a copy of the speech, which has no significance\r\nexcept as showing that I did not wish to be included in the category\r\nof certain venal bureaucrats who turned their coat with contemptible\r\nshamelessness to suit the wind. The impression it made was piteous,\r\nwhile even my most zealous opponents shook my hand with greater warmth\r\nafter my declaration. I have just come from a great citizens' meeting,\r\nof perhaps a thousand people, in the Milenz Hall, where the Polish\r\nquestion was debated very decorously, very good speeches were made,\r\nand on the whole the sentiment seemed to turn against the Poles,\r\nespecially after a disconsolate Jew had arrived, straight from Samter,\r\nwho told terrible stories about the lawless excesses of the Poles\r\nagainst the Germans; he himself had been soundly beaten. * * *\r\n\r\nJust for my sake do not alarm yourself if each mail does not bring you\r\na letter from me. There is not the slightest probability that a hair\r\nof our heads will be touched, and my friends of all kinds overrun\r\nme, to share their political wisdom with me, so that I began a letter\r\nof one-quarter sheet to Malle this morning at 9, and could not finish\r\nbefore 3. I am living in comfort and economy with Werdeck, only rather\r\nfar away, in consequence of which I already feel the pavement through\r\nmy soles. Cordial remembrances to the mother and the Bellins. I am\r\nwriting on the _table d'hôte_ table of the Hôtel des Princes, and a\r\nsmall salad has just been brought for my supper.\r\n\r\nYour very faithful B. April 3, '48.\r\n\r\n\r\nSchönhausen, August 21, '48. 8.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nTo HERR VON PUTTKAMER, AT REINFELD, NEAR ZUCKERS, POMERANIA.\r\n\r\n_Dear Father_,--You have just become, with God's gracious help, the\r\ngrandfather of a healthy, well-formed girl that Johanna has presented\r\nme with after hard but short pains. At the moment mother and child are\r\ndoing as well as one could wish. Johanna lies still and tired, yet\r\ncheerful and composed, behind the curtain; the little creature, in the\r\nmeantime, under coverlets on the sofa, and squalls off and on. I am\r\nquite glad that the first is a daughter, but if it had been a cat I\r\nshould have thanked God on my knees the moment Johanna was rid of it:\r\nit is really a desperately hard business. I came from Berlin last\r\nnight, and this morning we had no premonition of what was to come. At\r\nten in the morning Johanna was seized with severe pains after eating a\r\ngrape, and the accompanying symptoms led me to put her at once to bed,\r\nand to send in haste to Tangermünde, whence, in spite of the Elbe, Dr.\r\nFricke arrived soon after 12. At 8 my daughter was audible, with\r\nsonorous voice. This afternoon I sent Hildebrand off to fetch nurse\r\nBoldt from Berlin in a great hurry. I hope you will not postpone your\r\njourney now; but earnestly beg dear mother not to make the trip in an\r\nexhausting manner. I know, of course, that she has little regard for\r\nher own health, but just for Johanna's sake you must take care of\r\nyourself, dear mother, so that she may not be anxious on your account.\r\nFricke pleases us very much--experienced and careful. I do not admit\r\nvisits: Bellin's wife, the doctor, and I attend to everything. Fricke\r\nestimates the little one at about nine pounds in weight. Up to the\r\npresent time, then, everything has gone according to rule, and for\r\nthat praise and thanks be to the Lord. If you could bring Aennchen\r\nwith you that would make Johanna very happy.\r\n\r\n22. _Morning_.--It is all going very well, only the cradle is still\r\nlacking, and the little miss must camp meanwhile on a forage-crib. May\r\nGod have you and us in his keeping, dear parents.\r\n\r\nUntil we meet again, presently. B.\r\n\r\nHave the kindness to attend to the announcements, save in Berlin and\r\nReddentin, in your neighborhood: Seehof, Satz, and so forth. Johanna\r\nsends cordial greetings. She laments her daughter's large nose. I\r\nthink it no larger than it has a right to be.\r\n\r\nBerlin, Saturday, 11 p. m. September 23, '48.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo FRAU VON BISMARCK, SCHÖNHAUSEN, NEAR JERICHOW.\r\n\r\n_My Pet!_--Today at last I have news of your condition, and am very\r\ngrateful to mother for the letter. * * * I am beginning to be really\r\nhomesick for you, my heart, and mother's letter today threw me into a\r\nmood utterly sad and crippling: a husband's heart, and a father's--at\r\nany rate, mine in the present circumstances--does not fit in with the\r\nwhirl of politics and intrigue. On Monday, probably, the die will be\r\ncast here. Either the ministry will be shown to be weak, like its\r\npredecessors, and sink out--and against this I shall still\r\nstruggle--or it will do its duty, and then I do not for a moment doubt\r\nthat blood will flow on Monday evening or on Tuesday. I should not\r\nhave believed that the democrats would be confident enough to take up\r\nthe gage of battle, but all their behavior indicates that they are\r\nbent on it. Poles, Frankfort men, loafers, volunteers--all sorts of\r\nriffraff are again at hand. They count on the defection of the troops,\r\napparently misled by the talk of individual discontented gabblers\r\namong the soldiers; but I think they will make a great mistake. I\r\npersonally have no occasion to await the thing here, and so to tempt\r\nGod by asking him to protect me in perils that I have no call to seek.\r\nAccordingly, I shall betake my person to a place of safety not later\r\nthan tomorrow. If nothing important occurs on Monday, on Tuesday I\r\nshall reach you; but, if the trouble begins, I should still like to\r\nstay near the King. But there you may (in an aside I say\r\n\"unfortunately\") assume with confidence that there will be no danger.\r\nYou received no letter from me today, because I sent a report about\r\nthe society to Gärtner, and you will learn from him that I am all\r\nright. You will receive this tomorrow, and I shall write again on\r\nMonday. Send horses for me on Tuesday. God bless and guard you, my\r\nsweetheart.\r\n\r\nYour faithful B.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Postmark, Berlin, November 9, '48.)\r\n\r\n_My Dearest_,--Although I am confident that I shall be with you in\r\nperson a few hours after this letter, I want to inform you immediately\r\nthat everything is quiet till now. I go to Potsdam at nine, but must\r\npost the letter here now, as otherwise it will not reach you today.\r\nOur friends have been steadfast till now, but I cannot take courage\r\nyet to believe in anything energetic. I still fear, fear, and the\r\nweather is unfavorable, too. Above all, you must not be afraid of\r\nanything, if I should stay away today by any chance. The K. may send\r\nfor me, or some one else in Potsdam earnestly wish that I should stay\r\nthere to advise upon further measures, the trains may be delayed\r\nbecause the carriages are required for soldiers, and other things of\r\nthe sort. Then, courage and patience, my heart, in any event. The God\r\nwho makes worlds go round can also cover me with his wings. And in P.\r\nthere is no danger anyhow. So expect me in the evening; if I happen\r\nnot to come, I shall be all right nevertheless. Cordial remembrances\r\nto our cross little mother.\r\n\r\nYour most faithful B.\r\n\r\n\r\nPotsdam, November 10, '48.\r\n\r\n_My Angel_,--Please, please do not scold me for not coming today\r\neither; I must try to put through some more matters in relation to the\r\nimmediate future. At two this afternoon all Wrangel's troops will\r\nreach Berlin, disarm the flying corps, maybe, take the disaffected\r\ndeputies from the _Concertsaal,_ and make the city again a royal\r\nPrussian one. It is doubtful whether they will come to blows in the\r\nprocess. Contrary to our expectations, everything remained quiet\r\nyesterday; the democrats seem to be much discouraged. * * *\r\n\r\nYour v.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nPotsdam, November 14, '48.\r\n\r\n_My Dear Pet_,--Long sleep can certainly become a vice. Senfft has\r\njust waked me at nine o'clock, and I cannot yet get the sand out of my\r\neyes. It is quiet here. Yesterday it was said to be the intention to\r\nserenade the Queen (on her birthday) with mock music; one company\r\nposted there sufficed to make the audacious people withdraw in\r\nsilence. Berlin is in a state of siege, but as yet not a shot fired.\r\nThe disarming of the city militia goes on forcibly and very gradually.\r\nThe meeting in the Schützenhaus was dispersed by soldiers yesterday;\r\nsix men who were unwilling to go were thrown out. Martial law will be\r\nproclaimed over there today. My friend Schramm has been arrested. That\r\nRob. Blum, Fröbel, Messenhauser, have been shot in Vienna, you already\r\nknow from the newspapers. Good-by, you angel; I must close. Many\r\nremembrances to all. The peasants of the neighborhood have declared to\r\nthe King that if he has need of them he should just call them: that\r\nthey would come with weapons and supplies to aid his troops, from the\r\nZauch-Belzig-Teltow, the Havelland, and other districts. Mention that\r\nin Schönhausen, please, so that it may go the rounds.\r\n\r\nYour v.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nPotsdam, Thursday Morning, November 16, '48.\r\n\r\n_Dear Nanne!_--I did not get your very dear, nice letter of Tuesday\r\nmorning until yesterday afternoon, but none the less did I right\r\nfervently rejoice and take comfort in it, because you are well, at\r\nleast in your way, and are fond of me. There is no news from here\r\nexcept that Potsdam and Berlin are as quiet as under the former King,\r\nand the surrender of arms in B. continues without interruption, with\r\nsearching of houses, etc. It is possible that there may be scenes of\r\nviolence incidentally--the troops secretly long for them--but on the\r\nwhole the \"passive resistance\" of the democrats seems to me only a\r\nseasonable expression for what is usually called fear. Yesterday I\r\ndined with the King. The Queen was amiable in the English fashion. The\r\nenclosed twig of erica I picked from her sewing-table, and send it to\r\nkeep you from being jealous. * * *\r\n\r\nIf a letter from the Stettin bank has arrived, send it to me\r\nimmediately, please, marked, \"To be delivered promptly.\" If I do not\r\nreceive it before day after tomorrow, I shall return home, but must\r\nthen go to Stettin at the beginning of next week. So let horses be\r\nsent for me on Saturday afternoon; this evening I unfortunately cannot\r\ngo to Genthin, because I expect Manteuffel here. * * *\r\n\r\nThe democrats are working all their schemes in order to represent the\r\nopinion of the \"people\" as hostile to the King; hundreds of feigned\r\nsignatures. Please ask the town-councillor whether there are not some\r\nsensible people in Magdeburg, who care more for their neck, with quiet\r\nand good order, than for this outcry of street politicians, and who\r\nwill send the King a counter-address from Magdeburg. I must close.\r\nGive my best regards to mamma, and kiss the little one for me on the\r\nleft eye. Day after tomorrow, then, if I do not get the Stettin letter\r\nsooner. Good-by, my sweet angel. Yours forever, v.B. Schönhausen,\r\nJuly 18, '49.\r\n\r\n_My Pet_,--  * * * I wanted to write you in the evening, but the air was\r\nso heavenly that I sat for two hours or so on the bench in front of\r\nthe garden-house, smoked and looked at the bats flying, just as with\r\nyou two years ago, my darling, before we started on our trip. The\r\ntrees stood so still and high near me, the air fragrant with linden\r\nblossoms; in the garden a quail whistled and partridges allured, and\r\nover beyond Arneburg lay the last pink border of the sunset. I was\r\ntruly filled with gratitude to God, and there arose before my soul the\r\nquiet happiness of a family life filled with love, a peaceful haven,\r\ninto which a gust of wind perchance forces its way from the storms of\r\nthe world-ocean and ruffles the surface, but its warm depths remain\r\nclear and still so long as the cross of the Lord is reflected in them.\r\nThough the reflected image be often faint and distorted, God knows his\r\nsign still. Do you give thanks to Him, too, my angel; think of the\r\nmany blessings He has conferred upon us, and the many dangers against\r\nwhich He has protected us, and, with firm reliance on His strong hand,\r\nconfront the evil spirits with that when they try to affright your\r\nsick fancy with all sorts of images of fear. * * *\r\n\r\nYour most faithful\r\nv.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrandenburg, July 23, '49.\r\n\r\n_My Beloved Nanne!_--I have just received your short letter of Friday,\r\nwhich reassures me somewhat, as I infer from it that our little one\r\nhas not the croup, but the whooping-cough, which is, indeed, bad, but\r\nnot so dangerous as the other. You, poor dear, must have worried\r\nyourself sick. It is very fortunate that you have such good assistance\r\nfrom our people and the preacher, yet are you all somewhat lacking in\r\nconfidence, and increase each other's anxiety instead of comforting\r\none another. Barschall has just told me that all of his children have\r\nhad this croupy cough--that it was endemic in Posen in his time; his\r\nown and other children were attacked by it repeatedly in the course of\r\na few days; that every family had an emetic of a certain kind on hand\r\nin the house, and by that means overcame the enemy easily every time,\r\nand without permanent consequences for the child. Be comforted, then,\r\nand trust in the Lord God; He does, indeed, show us the rod that He\r\nhas ready for us, but I have the firm belief that He will put it back\r\nbehind the mirror. As a child I, too, suffered from whooping-cough to\r\nthe extent of inflammation of the lungs, and yet entirely outgrew it.\r\nI have the greatest longing to be with you, my angel, and think day\r\nand night about you and your distress, and about the little creature,\r\nduring all the wild turmoil of the elections. * * *\r\n\r\nHere in Brandenburg the party of the centre is decidedly stronger than\r\nours; in the country districts I hope it is the other way, yet the\r\nfact cannot be overlooked. It is incredible what cock-and-bull stories\r\nthe democrats tell the peasants about me; in fact, one from the\r\nSchönhausen district, three miles from us, confided to me yesterday\r\nthat, when my name is mentioned among them, a regular shudder goes\r\nthrough them from head to foot, as though they should get a couple of\r\n\"old-Prussian broadsword strokes\" laid across their shoulders. As an\r\nopponent said recently, at a meeting, \"Do you mean to elect Bismarck\r\nSchönhausen, the man 'who, in the countryman's evening prayer, stands\r\nhard by the devil'?\" (From Grillparzer's _Ahnfrau_.) And yet I am the\r\nmost soft-hearted person in the world towards the common people. On\r\nthe whole, my election here in these circumstances seems very doubtful\r\nto me; and as I do not believe I shall be elected in the other place\r\neither, when I am not there personally, we may live together quietly\r\nthe rest of the summer, if it be God's will, and I will pet you into\r\nrecovery from your fright about the child, my darling. Have no anxiety\r\nwhatever about my personal safety; one hears nothing of the cholera\r\nhere except in a letter from Reinfeld. The first rule to observe, if\r\nit should come nearer to you, is to speak of it as little as possible;\r\nby speaking, one always augments the fear of others, and fear of it\r\nis the easiest bridge on which it can enter the human body. * * *\r\n\r\nGod guard you and your child, and all our house.\r\n\r\nYour most faithful\r\n\r\nv.B.\r\n\r\nIt is better not to leave the doors all open constantly, for the child\r\noften gets shock from the draught, when one is opened, before you can\r\nprevent it.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Postmark, Berlin, August 8, '49.)\r\n\r\n_My Love_,--I sent you a letter this morning, and have just received\r\nyours, in reply to which I will add a few more words touching the\r\nwet-nurse. If any one besides you and father and mother already knows\r\nabout the matter, in the house or outside, then tell her the truth\r\nunhesitatingly, for in that case it will not stay hidden. If the\r\nmatter is still known to yourselves alone, let it continue so, but\r\nthen keep watch on the mail-bag, lest she learn of it unexpectedly.\r\nThe wet-nurse's sister here is unwilling to have it told to her. I\r\nshall look her up today and speak with her. But if you do not wish to\r\nkeep it secret any longer, when once the child is rid of her cough,\r\nyou should at any rate look about you for a wet-nurse or woman who, in\r\ncase of necessity, can take Friederike's place immediately, if the\r\neffect is such that the child cannot stay with her. I shall get the\r\nsister to give me a letter to her, in which the story will be told\r\nexactly and soothingly; this I shall send to you, so that you may make\r\nuse of it in case of need; that, I think, is the best way she can\r\nlearn of it. To tell her first that her child is sick, and so forth, I\r\ndo not consider a good plan, for anxiety has a worse effect than the\r\ntruth. God will graciously bring us out of this trouble. He holds us\r\nwith a short rein lest we should become self-confident, but He will\r\nnot let us fall. Good-by, my best-of-all; pray and keep your head up.\r\n\r\nYour very faithful\r\n\r\nv.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nBerlin, August 11, '49.\r\n\r\n_Mon Ange_,--I went to see the wet-nurse's kinsfolk, and there learned\r\nthat the _fiancé_ had written to her last Wednesday and revealed all\r\nto her; so the matter will go as God directs. If you chanced to\r\nintercept the letter, and on receipt of this have not yet delivered\r\nit, please delay it until my next arrives. I could not find the\r\n_fiancé_ himself, and directed him to come to me this evening, and\r\nshall write you what I learn from him. If Friederike knows everything\r\nalready, my wishes will reach you too late; otherwise I should like,\r\nif in accordance with medical opinion, not to have the wet-nurse sent\r\naway altogether, but only relieved from service for a few hours or\r\ndays; if, however, there are scruples on that point, it can't be done,\r\nof course. From my many doubts, you will see that I cannot decide the\r\nmatter very well at this distance. Act quite in accordance with the\r\nadvice of your mother and the other experienced friends. I give my\r\nviews, merely, not commands. * * * Be content with these lines for\r\ntoday; be courageous and submissive to God's will, my darling; all\r\nwill surely go well. Cordial remembrances to the parents.\r\n\r\nYour most faithful\r\n\r\nv.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nBerlin, Friday. (Postmark, August 17, '49.)\r\n\r\n_Dearest Nanne_,-- * * * Your last letter, in which you inform me of\r\nthe happy solution of the wet-nurse difficulty, took a real load off\r\nmy heart; I thanked God for His mercy, and could almost have got drunk\r\nfrom pure gayety. May His protection extend henceforward, too, over\r\nyou and the little darling. I am living with Hans here at the corner\r\nof Taubenstrasse, three rooms and one alcove, quite elegant, but\r\nnarrow little holes; Hans' bed full of bugs, but mine not as yet--I\r\nseem not to be to their taste. We pay twenty-five rix-dollars a month,\r\ntogether. If there were one additional small room, and not two flights\r\nof stairs, I could live with you here, and Hans could get another\r\napartment below in this house. But, as it is, it would be too cramped\r\nfor us. I have talked with the _fiancé_ of the wet-nurse, a\r\nmodest-looking person. He spoke of her with love, and declared in\r\nreply to my question that he certainly is willing to marry her. What\r\nhe wrote about the \"white pestilence\" is nonsense; no such sickness\r\nexists, least of all in Berlin. The cholera is fast disappearing. I\r\nhave not heard a word more about it since I came here; one sees it\r\nonly in newspaper reports. Isn't our mammy jealous because, according\r\nto the paper, I have been in company with \"strikingly handsome\"\r\nEnglishwomen? Lady Jersey was really something uncommon, such as is\r\nusually seen only in _keepsakes_. I would have paid a rix-dollar\r\nadmission if she had been exhibited for money. She is now in Vienna.\r\nFor the rest, I have not had a letter from you this long time; my last\r\nnews comes from Bernhard, who left you a week ago today. God has\r\nupheld you meantime, I trust, my angel. It is possible that a letter\r\nfrom you is here. The delivery is always rather irregular: sometimes\r\nthe letter-carrier brings them, sometimes they are delivered at the\r\nChamber postal station. I will go immediately and inquire if anything\r\nis there; then I will take a bath, and return at least ten calls that\r\nhave been paid me. It is a misery that now the people always receive\r\none--one loses a terrible amount of time at it.... Hans is still\r\ninclined to treat me tyrannically, but I resist, and have been so far\r\nsuccessful that I sleep as long as I please, whereat the coffee grows\r\ncold, however, as he is obstinately bent on not breakfasting alone.\r\nSo, too, he will not go to bed if I do not go at the same time, but\r\nsleeps, just like my little Nanne, on the sofa.... Now, good-by my\r\nmuch-beloved heart. I am very anxious on your account, and often am\r\nquite tearful about it. Best regards to the parents.\r\n\r\nYour most faithful v.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nBerlin, Monday. (Postmark, August 28, '49.)\r\n\r\n_My Darling_,--I sit here in my corner room, two flights up, and\r\nsurvey the sky, full of nothing but little sunset-tinted lambs, as it\r\nappears, along the Taubenstrasse and over the tree-tops of Prinz\r\nCarl's garden, while along Friedrichstrasse it is all golden and\r\ncloudless; the air damp and mild, too. I thought of you and of Venice,\r\nand this only I wanted to write to you. News has come today that\r\nVenice has surrendered at discretion; so we can go there again, and\r\nagain see the tall white grenadiers. * * * I dined with Manteuffel\r\ntoday, yesterday with Prince Albert, of course, day before yesterday\r\nwith Arnim, and then I took a ride with him of fourteen miles at a\r\ngallop--which suited me well, save for some muscular pains. In the\r\nChamber we keep on doing nothing whatever; in the Upper House the\r\nGerman question, happily, has been brought forward again in very good\r\nspeeches by Gerlach, Bethmann, and Stahl, and yet today the Camphausen\r\nproposition was adopted with all the votes against nineteen. With us,\r\ntoo, it is beginning to excite men's tempers. The proposition is bad\r\nin its tendency, but its result insignificant even if it goes through\r\nwith us, as is to be expected. _Tant de bruit pour une omelette_. The\r\nreal decision will not be reached in our Chambers, but in diplomacy\r\nand on the battlefield, and all that we prate and resolve about it has\r\nno more value than the moonshine observations of a sentimental youth\r\nwho builds air-castles and thinks that some unexpected event will make\r\nhim a great man. _Je m'en moque!_--and the farce often bores me nearly\r\nto death, because I see no sensible object in this straw-threshing.\r\nMother's little letter gave me great pleasure, because, in the first\r\nplace, I see that you are well, and then because she has her old joke\r\nwith me, which is much pleasanter at a distance, as it does not lead\r\nto strife; and yet how I should like to quarrel with mammy once more!\r\nI am genuinely homesick to be quietly with you all in Schönhausen.\r\nHave you received the ribbon for Aennchen?\r\n\r\n_Tuesday_.--Hans is just breakfasting, and eating up, from sheer\r\nstinginess, a quarter pound of butter that he bought three days ago,\r\nbecause it begins to get old. Now he screams that my tea is there,\r\ntoo. I close for today, as I have something to do afterwards. My love\r\nto FatherMotherAnnaAdelheidMarie and all the rest. God's blessing be\r\nwith you and keep you well and merry.\r\n\r\nYour most faithful v.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nBerlin, September 11, '49. (Postmarked September 10.)\r\n\r\nI wrote yesterday, my Nannie, but as it costs me nothing, not even for\r\npaper, for this is the Chamber's, I do want to improve a wearisome\r\nmoment, during which I must listen to the reading of a confused report\r\non normal prices, to send you another little greeting; but again\r\nwithout the ribbon, for I am going to buy that later on. This morning\r\nI attended the cavalry manoeuvres, on a very pleasant horse of\r\nFritz's; rode sharply, swallowed much dust, but, nevertheless, had a\r\ngood time; it is really pretty, these brilliant, rapidly moving masses\r\ninterspersed with the clanking of iron and the bugle signals. The\r\nQueen, my old flame, greeted me so cordially. Having driven past\r\nwithout noticing me, she rose and turned backward over the bar of the\r\ncarriage, to nod to me thrice; that lady appreciates a Prussian heart.\r\nTomorrow I shall take a look at the grand parade, in which the\r\ninfantry also participates. I believe I have written you that the King\r\nand Leopold Gerlach visited the Emperor of Austria at Teplitz, where\r\nthere was also a Russian plenipotentiary. The proletariats of the\r\nChamber are now gradually coming to see that on that occasion\r\nsomething may have been concocted which will cast mildew on their\r\nGerman hot-house flowers, and the fact that his Majesty has conversed\r\nwith the ruler of all the Croatians frightens them somewhat. _Qui\r\nvivra verra_. These Frankfort cabbage-heads are incorrigible; they\r\nand their phrases are like the old liars who in the end honestly\r\nbelieve their own stories; and the impression produced on our Chamber\r\nby such ridiculous things as they say, without any regard for the\r\nmatter in hand, or for common-sense, will be sure at last to convince\r\npeople generally that peasants and provincials are not fit to make\r\nlaws and conduct European politics. Now I must listen. Farewell, my\r\nmuch-beloved heart. Love to my daughter and your parents.\r\n\r\nYour most faithful v.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nBerlin, Friday.\r\n\r\n(Postmarked September 21, '49.)\r\n\r\nI am well, my darling Nan, but I am cold, for in the morning the rooms\r\nare already so chilly that I long very much for the Schönhausen\r\nfireplaces, and matters in the Chamber are so tedious that I often\r\nhave serious thoughts of resigning my commission. In the ministry\r\nthere is again a shameful measure preparing; they now want to submit a\r\nreal property tax bill, according to which those estates which are not\r\nmanors are to be indemnified, while manors must suffer, as the number\r\nof nobles is not dangerous. Only if encumbered for more than\r\ntwo-thirds of their value, they are to be assisted by loans. What good\r\nwill a loan do a bankrupt, who has it to repay! It is a mixture of\r\ncowardice and shameless injustice such as I could not have expected.\r\nYesterday we had soft, warm autumn weather, and I took a long walk in\r\nthe Thiergarten, by the same solitary paths which we used to traverse\r\ntogether; I sat, too, on our bench near the swan-pond; the young swans\r\nwhich were then still in their eggs on the little island were now\r\nswimming vivaciously about, fat, gray, and _blasé_, among the dirty\r\nducks, and the old ones sleepily laid their heads on their backs. The\r\nhandsome large maple standing near the bridge has already leaves of a\r\ndark-red color; I wished to send you one of them, but in my pocket it\r\nhas become so hard that it crumbles away; the gold-fish pond is\r\nalmost dried up; the lindens, the black alders, and other delicate\r\nthings bestrew the paths with their yellow, rustling foliage, and the\r\nround chestnut-burrs exhibit a medley of all shades of sombre and\r\nattractive fall coloring. The promenade, with its morning fogs among\r\nthe trees, reminded me vividly of Kniephof, the woodcock-hunt, the\r\nline of springes, and how everything was so green and fresh when I\r\nused to walk there with you, my darling. * * * On the 1st of October I\r\nshall probably have to attend the celebration of the nine-hundredth\r\nanniversary of the founding of the cathedral there, to which the King\r\nis coming. For the 2d and the following days I have been invited to go\r\non a royal hunt to the Falkenstein. I should be very glad to shoot a\r\ndeer in those woods which we and Mary saw illuminated by the moon on\r\nthat evening; but even if matters in the Chamber should not prevent, I\r\nam at a loss how to reconcile that with our journey, and I feel as\r\nthough I should steal my days from you by going. * * * I am now going\r\nout to buy a waist, to call on Rauch, and then again to the\r\nThiergarten. All love to father and mother, and may God preserve you\r\nin the future as hitherto, my dearest.\r\n\r\nYour most faithful v.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nBerlin, Friday.\r\n\r\n(Postmarked September 28, '49.)\r\n\r\n_My Dear,--_I have taken the apartment in the Behrenstrasse; that on\r\nthe Thiergarten is too uncomfortable for you in going in and out in\r\nwet winter weather. * * * It is better that I should procure and\r\narrange everything for you in advance; then you need only alight here\r\nand sink into my open arms and on a ready sofa; that would be so\r\npretty; only come soon, my beloved angel; today the weather is already\r\nbitter cold, and write me exactly when I can come for you to Z. Do not\r\nbe offended, either, at my note of yesterday, and do not think that\r\nyou have offended me, but please come quickly. I am not going to the\r\nHarz. Much love. In great haste.\r\n\r\nYour most faithful v.B.\r\n\r\n  Over the blue mountain,\r\n  Over the white sea-foam,\r\n  Come, thou beloved one,\r\n  Come to thy lonely home.\r\n\r\n                    --_Old Song_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSchönhausen, October 2, '49.\r\n\r\n_My Beloved Nan,--I am sitting in our quiet old Schönhausen, where I\r\nam quite comfortable, after the Berlin hubbub, and I should like to\r\nstay here a week, if the old Chamber allowed. This morning Odin\r\nawakened me, and then retreated as usual between the beds; then the\r\nBellins groaned very much about the bad qualities of the tenant, with\r\nwhom they lead a cat-and-dog life, and I discussed with her, pro and\r\ncon, all that is to be sent to Berlin. The garden is still quite green\r\nfor the fall season, but the paths are overgrown with grass, and our\r\nlittle island is so dwarfed and wet that I could not get on to it; it\r\nrains without let-up. The little alderman, of course, sat with me all\r\nthe afternoon, otherwise I should have written you sooner and more at\r\nlength. I want to leave again tomorrow morning, and I have still\r\nseveral business letters to write. Yesterday, with the King, I\r\ncelebrated the nine-hundredth anniversary of the Brandenburg\r\nCathedral, after it had been thoroughly exorcised and the bad national\r\nspirits driven out. The entire royal family was there, except the\r\nPrincess of Babelsberg, who is at Weimar; also Brandenburg,\r\nManteuffel, Wrangel, Voss, and many high dignitaries, among them\r\nmyself, quite courageously at the front in church, next to the\r\nprincesses. At dinner his Majesty said many pretty things about his\r\nelectoral and capital city of Brandenburg, and was also very friendly\r\nto me. I introduced to the Queen a number of village mayors, who had\r\nbeen of particular service in my election; they were so much moved by\r\nit that afterwards they embraced me with tears in their eyes. Finally,\r\nthe King became very angry at Patow, who had made his appearance as\r\nPresident-in-chief, and to whom he had not spoken till then. \"Sir,\"\r\nsaid he, in a very loud and angry voice, \"if you belong to the Right,\r\nthen vote with the Right; if you belong to the Left, vote, in the----\r\nname with the Left; but I require of my servants that they stand by\r\nme, do you understand?\" Breathless silence, and P---- looked like a\r\nduck in a thunder-storm. * * * It is right good that I did not take\r\nthe apartment on the Thiergarten; aside from the wet feet which my\r\nangel would get in dirty and damp weather, the house has been broken\r\ninto seven times during the couple of years of its existence, a fact\r\nof which sympathizing souls would surely have informed you; and, if on\r\nsome long winter evening I were not at home, you and the two girls and\r\nbaby would have shuddered mightily over it. The little old clock is\r\njust clearing its throat to strike seven; I must to my work. Farewell,\r\ndearest; and, above all things, come-mmmm quickly--in a hurry,\r\nswiftly, instantly--to your dear little husbandkin. Most hearty\r\ngreetings to our parents.\r\n\r\nYour most faithful v.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nErfurt, April 19, '50.\r\n\r\n_My Beloved Nan_,--It is bad to live in such a small town, with three\r\nhundred acquaintances. One is never sure of his life a single moment,\r\nfor calls. An hour ago I got rid of the last bores; then, during\r\nsupper, I walked up and down in my room, and annihilated almost the\r\nwhole fat sausage, which is very delicious, drank a stone mug of beer\r\nfrom the Erfurt \"Felsenkeller,\" and now, while writing, I am eating\r\nthe second little box of Marchpane, which was, perhaps, intended for\r\nHans, who has not got any of the sausage even; in its place I will\r\nleave him the little ham. During the last few days we have been\r\nvaliantly quarrelling in Parliament; but neither at the beginning nor\r\nlater could I obtain the floor for my principal speech; but I relieved\r\nmyself of some gall in minor skirmishes. * * * I am sick and tired of\r\nlife here; attending the sitting early in the morning, thence directly\r\nto a screaming and chattering _table d'hôte,_ then for coffee to the\r\nSteiger, a most charming little mountain, a mile from the city, where\r\none can walk about through the pleasantest hours of the day with a\r\npretty view of Erfurt and the Thuringian woods; under magnificent\r\noaks, among the little light-green leaves of prickles and horn-beam;\r\nfrom there to the abominable party caucus, which has never yet made me\r\nany the wiser, so that one does not get home all day. If I do not\r\nattend the caucus meetings, they all rail at me, for each one grudges\r\nthe others any escape from the tedium. * * * Good-by, my heart. May\r\nGod's hand be over you, and the children, and protect you from\r\nsickness and worry, but particularly you, the apple of my eye, whom\r\nRöder envies me daily in the promenade, when the sunset makes him\r\nsentimental, and he wishes he had such a \"good, dear, devout wife.\"\r\nFor the rest, my allowance suffices for my needs here, and I shall\r\nstill bring treasures home. Good-night, my darling. Many thanks for\r\nyour faithful letter, and write me again at once; I am always anxious\r\nfor news. Hans has just come in, and sends you sleepy greetings, after\r\nsitting on the lounge for hardly ten seconds. Once more, good-night,\r\nmy Nan.\r\n\r\nYour most faithful v.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nErfurt, April 23, '50.\r\n\r\n_My Darling_,-- * * * We shall probably be released a week from today,\r\nand then we have before us a quiet Schönhausen summer, as the cry of\r\nwar is also dying. It is really going to be summer again, and on a\r\nvery long walk, from which I am returning home dead tired, I took much\r\npleasure in the small green leaves of the hazel and white beech, and\r\nheard the cuckoo, who told me that we shall live together for eleven\r\nyears more; let us hope longer still. My hunt was extraordinary;\r\ncharming wild pine-woods on the ride out, sky-high, as in the\r\nErzgebirge; then, on the other side, steep valleys, like the Selke,\r\nonly the hills were much higher, with beeches and oaks. The night\r\nbefore starting I had slept but four hours; then went to bed at nine\r\no'clock in Schleusingen on the south side of the Thuringian wood;\r\narose at midnight; that evening I had eaten freely of the trout and\r\nhad drunk weak beer with them; at one o'clock we rode to a forge in\r\nthe mountains, where ghostlike people poked the fire; then we climbed,\r\nwithout stopping, until three o 'clock, in pouring rain, I wearing a\r\nheavy overcoat; so steep that I had to help myself with my hands; so\r\ndark in the fir thickets that I could touch the huntsman ahead of me\r\nwith my hand, but could not see him. Then, too, we were told there is\r\na precipice on the right, and the torrent sent up its roar from the\r\npurple depths below; or that there is a pool on the left, and the path\r\nwas slippery. I had to halt three times; repeatedly I almost fainted\r\nfrom weakness, lay down on the dripping heath, and let the rain pour\r\non me. But I was firmly resolved to see the grouse; and I did see\r\nseveral, but could not shoot them, for reasons which one must be a\r\nhuntsman to understand. My companion shot one, and, if I had been\r\nwell, I might have shot two; I was too exhausted. After three it\r\ncleared and became wonderfully fine, the horn-owl gave place to the\r\nthrush, and at sunrise the bird-chorus became deafening; the\r\nwood-pigeons singing bass, withal. At five I was down again, and, as\r\nit began to pour once more, I abandoned further attempts, returned\r\nhither, ate very heartily, after a twenty-four hours' fast, and drank\r\ntwo glasses of champagne, then slept for fourteen hours, until\r\nyesterday at one o'clock, noon, and now I am feeling much better than\r\nbefore the excursion, and am glad of the good constitution which God\r\nhas given me, to get through it all. * * * I send you lots of love, my\r\nheart, and will piously celebrate fast-day tomorrow at the Wermel\r\nchurch. God preserve you. Love to mother and Melissa. Excuse my haste.\r\nI had really left myself an hour of leisure, but that little old Mass\r\nhas his fourteenth child, just born. The only son of our poor\r\nEglofstein, of Arklitten, twenty-three-year-old lieutenant of\r\ncuirassiers, has shot himself in hypochondria; I pity the father\r\nextremely, a devout, honorable man.\r\n\r\nYour most faithful\r\n\r\nv.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nSchönhausen, Sunday Evening.\r\n\r\n(Postmarked Jerichow, September 30, '50.)\r\n\r\n_My Beloved Nan_,-- * * * I regained possession of my things in Berlin\r\nat some cost, after twenty-four hours had elapsed; when I left, the\r\nunfortunate Jew had not yet claimed his. Partly on my account and\r\npartly on Hans', we had to stay in Berlin two days, but this time the\r\nbill was more reasonable. * * * May the devil take politics! Here I\r\nfound everything as we left it, only the leaves show the rosiness of\r\nautumn; flowers are almost more plentiful than in summer; Kahle has a\r\nparticular fondness for them, and on the terrace fabulous pumpkins are\r\nsuspended by their vines from the trees. The pretty plums are gone;\r\nonly a few blue ones still remain; of the vine, only the common green\r\nvariety is ripe; next week I shall send you some grapes. I have\r\ndevoured so many figs today that I was obliged to drink rum, but they\r\nwere the last. I am sorry you cannot see the Indian corn; it stands\r\nclosely packed, three feet higher than I can reach with my hand; the\r\ncolts' pasture looks from a distance like a fifteen-year-old pine\r\npreserve. I am sitting here at your desk, a crackling fire behind me,\r\nand Odin, rolled into a knot, by my side. * * * Mamsell received me in\r\npink, with a black dancing-jacket; the children in the village\r\nridicule her swaggering about her noble and rich relations. She has\r\ncooked well again today, but, as to the feeding of the cattle, Bellin\r\nlaments bitterly that she understands nothing about it, and pays no\r\nattention to it, and she is also said to be uncleanly; the Bellin\r\nwoman does not eat a mouthful prepared by her. Her father is a common\r\ncottager and laborer; I can easily understand that she is out of place\r\nthere, with her grand airs and pink dresses. Up to this time the\r\ngarden, outside of Kahle's keep, has cost one hundred and three\r\nrix-dollars this year, and between now and Christmas forty to fifty\r\nwill probably be added for digging and harvesting, besides the fuel.\r\nThe contents of the greenhouse I shall try to have care of in the\r\nneighborhood; that is really the most difficult point, and still one\r\ncannot continue keeping the place for the sake of the few oranges. I\r\nam giving out that you will spend the winter in Berlin, that in the\r\nsummer-time we intend going to a watering-place again, and that,\r\ntherefore, we are giving up housekeeping for a year. * * * Hearty love\r\nto our parents. I shall celebrate father's birthday with you, like a\r\nConservative, in the old style. May the merciful God, for His Son's\r\nsake, preserve you and the children. Farewell, my dear Nan.\r\n\r\nYour v.B.\r\n\r\nSince leaving Reinfeld I no longer have heartburn; perhaps it is in my\r\nheart, and my heart has remained with Nan.\r\n\r\n\r\nSchönhausen, October 1, '50.\r\n\r\n_My Angel_,--I am so anxious that I can hardly endure being here; I\r\nhave the most decided inclination to inform the government at once of\r\nmy resignation, let the dike go, and proceed to Reinfeld. I expected\r\nto have a letter from you today, but nothing except stupid police\r\nmatters. Do write very, very often, even if it takes one hundred\r\nrix-dollars postage. I am always afraid that you are sick, and today I\r\nam in such a mood that I should like to foot it to Pomerania. I long\r\nfor the children, for mammy and dad, and, most of all, for you, my\r\ndarling, so that I have no peace at all. Without you here, what is\r\nSchönhausen to me? The dreary bedroom, the empty cradles with the\r\nlittle beds in them, all the absolute silence, like an autumn fog,\r\ninterrupted only by the ticking of the clock and the periodic falling\r\nof the chestnuts--it is as though you all were dead. I always imagine\r\nyour next letter will bring bad news, and if I knew it was in Genthin\r\nby this time I would send Hildebrand there in the night. Berlin is\r\nendurable when one is alone; there one is busy, and can chatter all\r\nday; but here it is enough to drive one mad; I must formerly have been\r\nan entirely different mortal, to bear it as I did. * * * The girl\r\nreceived the notice to leave very lightly and good-naturedly, as\r\nquite a matter of course; Kahle, on the other hand, was beside\r\nhimself, and almost cried; said he could not find a place at\r\nChristmas-time, and would go to the dogs, as he expressed it. I\r\nconsoled him by promising to pay his wages for another quarter if he\r\nfailed to find a place by New Year's. The girl is quite useless except\r\nin cooking, of which more orally. I cannot enumerate all the little\r\ntrifles, and certainly Kahle does not belong to the better half of\r\ngardeners. * * * I feel so vividly as if I were with you while writing\r\nthis that I am becoming quite gay, until I again recollect the three\r\nhundred and fifty miles, including one hundred and seventy-five\r\nwithout a railroad. Pomerania is terribly long, after all. Have you my\r\nKülz letter, too? Bernhard has probably kept it in his pocket. Do not\r\nprepay your letters, or they will be stolen. Innumerable books have\r\narrived from the binder; he claims one section of Scott's _Pirate_ is\r\nmissing; I know nothing about it. The tailor says that he has been\r\nable to make only five pair of drawers from the stuff; presumably he\r\nis wearing the sixth himself. Farewell, my sweetheart. Write as often\r\nas you can, and give love and kisses to every one from me, large and\r\nsmall. May God's mercy be with you.\r\n\r\nYour most faithful v.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nSchönhausen, October 10, '50.\r\n\r\n_My Darling_,--In a sullen rage I swoop down upon my inkstand after\r\njust lighting the Town Councillor downstairs with the kindliest\r\ncountenance in the world. He sat here for two and a half hours by the\r\nclock, moaning and groaning, without the least regard for my wry face;\r\nI was just about to read the paper when he came. From ten to two I\r\ncrawled about the Elbe's banks, in a boat and on foot, with many\r\nstupid people, attending to breakwaters, protective banks, and all\r\nsorts of nonsense. This is, in general, a day of vexations; this\r\nmorning I dreamed so charmingly that I stood with you on the seashore;\r\nit was just like the new strand, only the mud was rocks, the beeches\r\nwere thick-foliaged laurel, the sea was as green as the Lake of Traun,\r\nand opposite us lay Genoa, which we shall probably never see, and it\r\nwas delightfully warm; then I was awakened by Hildebrand, accompanied\r\nby a summoner, who brought me an order to serve as a juror at\r\nMagdeburg from October 20th to November 16th, under penalty of from\r\none hundred to two hundred rix-dollars for each day of absence. I am\r\ngoing there by the first train tomorrow, and hope to extricate myself;\r\nfor God so to punish my deep and restless longing for what is dearest\r\nto me in this world, so that we shall not have the fleeting pleasure\r\nof a couple of weeks together, would, indeed, be incredibly severe. I\r\nam all excitement; that is our share in the newly achieved\r\nliberty--that I am to be forced to spend my few days of freedom\r\nsitting in judgment over thievish tramps of Jews, like a prisoner in a\r\nfortress. I hope Gerlach can free me; otherwise I shall never speak to\r\nhim again. Tomorrow I shall at once drop you a line from Magdeburg, to\r\ntell you how I succeed. * * * The people have abandoned the\r\ndike-captain conspiracy against me; the Town Councillor says he will\r\nnot press it at all. He chattered to me for hours about his land-tax\r\ncommission, in which his anxiety drove him to rage against his own\r\nflesh, and also, unfortunately, against ours. Our chief misfortune is\r\nthe cowardly servility towards those above and the chasing after\r\npopularity below, which characterize our provincial councillor;\r\nconsequently public business, the chase, land-tax, etc., are all\r\ndeleteriously affected. It is due principally to the fact that he is\r\ngrossly ignorant and bungling in affairs, and is, therefore, for\r\nbetter, for worse, in the hands of his democratic circuit secretary,\r\nto whom he never dares to show his teeth; and, despite all that, the\r\nfellow wears trousers, has been a soldier, and is a nobleman. La-Croix\r\nis district-attorney at Madgeburg, withal, and he, too, must help me\r\nto sneak out of it. It is still impossible for me to acquiesce in the\r\nnotion that we are to be separated all winter, and I am sick at heart\r\nwhenever I think of it; only now do I truly feel how very, very much\r\nyou and the _babies_ are part of myself, and how you fill my being.\r\nThat probably explains why it is that I appear cold to all except you,\r\neven to mother; if God should impose on me the terrible affliction of\r\nlosing you, I feel, so far as my feelings can at this moment grasp and\r\nrealize such a wilderness of desolation, that I would then cling so to\r\nyour parents that mother would have to complain of being persecuted\r\nwith love. But away with all imaginary misery; there is enough in\r\nreality. Let us now earnestly thank the Lord that we are all together,\r\neven though separated by three hundred and fifty miles, and let us\r\nexperience the sweetness of knowing that we love each other very much,\r\nand can tell each other so. To me it is always like ingratitude to God\r\nthat we choose to live apart so long, and are not together while He\r\nmakes it possible for us; but He will show us His will; all may turn\r\nout differently; the Chambers may be dissolved, possibly very quickly,\r\nas the majority is probably opposed to the Ministry. Manteuffel was\r\nresolved upon it in that event, and it seems that Radowitz, since he\r\nis Minister, has approached him, and, in general, wants to change his\r\npolitics again. Best love to all. Farewell. God keep you.\r\n\r\nYour most faithful v.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nBerlin, April 28, '51.\r\n\r\n_My Dear Sweetheart_,--Mother's premonition that I would remain long\r\naway has, unfortunately, proved correct this time. * * * The King was\r\nthe first to propose my nomination, and that at once, as a real\r\ndelegate to the Diet; his plan has, of course, encountered much\r\nopposition, and has finally been so modified that Rochow will, it is\r\ntrue, remain Minister at Petersburg, whither he is to return in two\r\nmonths, but meanwhile, provisionally, he is commissioned to Frankfort,\r\nand I am to accompany him, with the assurance that, on his leaving for\r\nPetersburg, I shall be his successor. But this last is between\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nNow I want to go, first of all, to Frankfort, and take a\r\nlook at the situation, and hear how I shall stand pecuniarily pending\r\nmy definite appointment, of which I know nothing at all as yet. Then I\r\nshall see whether I can leave again shortly after the start, and\r\nwhether I am to count on staying any longer; for, although I have,\r\nindeed, accepted, still I am not yet sufficiently familiar with the\r\nground to be able to say definitely whether I shall stay there or\r\nshortly get out again. As soon as that is decided, we shall probably,\r\nafter all, have to consider for you, too, the prospect of exchanging\r\nyour quiet Reinfeld existence for the noise of the Diet's diplomacy.\r\nYou folks have often complained that nothing was made of me by those\r\nabove me; now this is, beyond my expectations and wishes, a sudden\r\nappointment to what is at this moment the most important post in our\r\ndiplomatic service; I have not sought it; I must assume that the Lord\r\nwished it, and I cannot withdraw, although I foresee that it will be\r\nan unfruitful and a thorny office, in which, with the best intentions,\r\nI shall forfeit the good opinion of many people. But it would be\r\ncowardly to decline. I cannot give you today further particulars as to\r\nour plans, how we shall meet, what will be done about your going to\r\nthe seashore; only I shall try to make leisure, if possible, to see\r\nyou before. I feel almost like crying when I think of this sudden\r\nupsetting of our innocent plans, as well as of the uncertainty when I\r\nshall see you again, my beloved heart, and the babies; and I earnestly\r\npray God to arrange it all without detriment to our earthly welfare\r\nand without harm to my soul. God be with you, my dear, and bring us\r\ntogether again soon. With heartfelt love.\r\n\r\nYour most faithful v.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrankfort, May 14, '51.\r\n\r\n_My Little Dear,_--* * * It seems to be getting constantly more\r\ncertain that I shall take Rochow's position in the summer. In that\r\nevent, if the rating remains as it was, I shall have a salary of\r\ntwenty-one thousand rix-dollars, but I shall have to keep a large\r\ntrain and household establishment and you, my poor child, must sit\r\nstiff and sedate in the drawing-room, be called Excellency, and be\r\nclever and wise with Excellencies. * * * The city is not so bad as you\r\nsuppose; there are a great many charming villas before the gates,\r\nsimilar to those in the Thiergarten, only more sunny. As Councillor of\r\nLegation, it will be difficult for us to live there, owing to distance\r\nand expense; but as Ambassador, quite as charming as is possible in a\r\nforeign land. By letters of introduction I have quickly become\r\nacquainted with the charming world hereabouts. Yesterday I dined with\r\nthe English Ambassador, Lord Cowley, nephew of the Duke of Wellington;\r\nvery kind, agreeable people; she is an elegant woman of about forty,\r\nvery worldly, but benevolent and easy to get acquainted with; I have\r\nimmediately put myself on a friendly footing with her, so that when\r\nyou step into the cold bath of diplomatic society she may be a\r\npowerful support for you. Previously I called on a Frau von Stallupin\r\n(pronounce Stolipine), a young woman without children, kindly, like\r\nall Russian women, but terribly rich, and settled in a little\r\ncastle-like villa, so that one hardly dares to take a step or to sit\r\ndown; a Scharteuck interior is a rude barn compared with it. Day\r\nbefore yesterday evening I called on Frau von Vrintz, a sister of\r\nMeyendorf's wife; the diplomatic folks assemble every evening in her\r\ndrawing-room. Countess Thun was there, a very handsome young woman, in\r\nthe style of Malvinia; also the Marquis de Tallenay, French\r\nAmbassador, a polite fifty-year-old; Count Szechenyi, a gay young\r\nMagyar, full of pranks, and divers other foreign personages. They\r\ngamble there every evening, the lady of the house, too, and not for\r\nvery low stakes; I was scolded for declaring it boresome, and told\r\nthem it would be my rôle to laugh at those who lost. Society probably\r\ndoes not appeal to you very strongly, my beloved heart, and it seems\r\nto me as though I were harming you by bringing you into it, but how\r\nshall I avoid that? I have one favor to ask of you, but keep it to\r\nyourself, and do not let mother suspect that I have written you one\r\nword about it, otherwise she will worry needlessly over it: occupy\r\nyourself with French as much as you can in the meantime, but let it be\r\nthought that you yourself have discovered that it is useful. Read\r\nFrench, but, if you love me, do not do so by artificial light, or if\r\nyour eyes pain you; in that case you had better ask mother to read to\r\nyou, for it is almost harder to understand than to speak. If you know\r\nof any agreeable piece of baggage you can get in a hurry to chatter\r\nFrench to you, then engage one; I will gladly pay the bill. You will\r\nenter here an atmosphere of French spirit and talk, anyway; so you\r\ncannot avoid familiarizing yourself with it as far as possible. If you\r\nknow of no person whom you like and who is available, let it go; and,\r\nat any rate, I beg you sincerely not to consider this advice as a\r\nhardship, or otherwise than if I asked you to buy yourself a green or\r\na blue dress; it is not a matter of life and death; you are _my_ wife,\r\nand not the diplomats', and they can just as well learn German as you\r\ncan learn French. Only if you have leisure, or wish to read anyway,\r\ntake a French novel; but if you have no desire to do so, consider this\r\nas not written, for I married you in order to love you in God and\r\naccording to the need of my heart, and in order to have in the midst\r\nof the strange world a place for my heart, which all the world's bleak\r\nwinds cannot chill, and where I may find the warmth of the home-fire,\r\nto which I eagerly betake myself when it is stormy and cold without;\r\nbut not to have a society woman for others, and I shall cherish and\r\nnurse your little fireplace, put wood on it and blow, and protect it\r\nagainst all that is evil and strange, for, next to God's mercy, there\r\nis nothing which is dearer and more necessary to me than your love,\r\nand the homelike hearth which stands between us everywhere, even in a\r\nstrange land, when we are together. Do not be too much depressed and\r\nsad over the change of our life; my heart is not attached, or, at\r\nleast, not strongly attached, to earthly honor; I shall easily\r\ndispense with it if it should ever endanger our peace with God or our\r\ncontentment. * * * Farewell, my dearly beloved heart. Kiss the\r\nchildren for me, and give your parents my love.\r\n\r\nYour most faithful v.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrankfort, May 16, '51.\r\n\r\n_Dear Mother_,--* * * So far as I am at present acquainted with the\r\n_highest_ circles of society, there is only one house which seems to\r\nme to promise company for Johanna--that of the English Ambassador. As\r\nthis letter will probably be opened by the Austrian (Frankfort)\r\npost-office authorities, I shall refrain from explaining on this\r\noccasion the reasons therefor. Even those letters which, like my last\r\nones, I took occasion to send by a courier, are not secure from\r\nindiscretions at _Berlin_; those to me as well as those from me; but\r\nthose which go by the regular mail are always opened, except when\r\nthere is no time for it, as the gentleman who will read this could\r\nprobably testify. But all that, for better, for worse, forms part of\r\nthe petty ills of my new position.\r\n\r\nIn my thoughts I must always ask you and our dad to forgive me for\r\ndepriving you of the pleasure and the happiness of your old days,\r\ninasmuch as I transplant to such a distance the bright child-life,\r\nwith all its dear cares, and take Johanna away a second time from her\r\nfather's house; but I see no other way out of it, which would not be\r\nunnatural, or even wrong, and the strong arm which separated us when\r\nwe hoped to be united can also unite us when we least expect it. You\r\nshall at least have the conviction, so far as human purpose can give\r\nit, that I shall wander, together with Johanna, with the strong staff\r\nof the Word of God, trough this dead and wicked activity of the world,\r\nwhose nakedness will become more apparent to us in our new position\r\nthan before, and that to the end of our joint pilgrimage my hand shall\r\nstrive, in faithful love, to smooth Johanna's paths, and to be a warm\r\ncovering to her against the breath of the great world.\r\n\r\nYour faithful son, v.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrankfort, May 18, '51.\r\n\r\n_My Darling_,--Frankfort is terribly tiresome; I am so spoiled by so\r\nmuch affection and so much business that I am only just beginning to\r\nsuspect how ungrateful I always was to some people in Berlin, to say\r\nnothing of you and yours; but even the cooler measure of fellowship\r\nand party affiliation which came to me in Berlin may be called an\r\nintimate relationship compared with intercourse here, which is, in\r\nfact, nothing more than mutual mistrust and espionage, if there only\r\nwere anything to spy out or to conceal! The people toil and fret over\r\nnothing but mere trifles, and these diplomats, with their\r\nconsequential hair-splitting, already seem to me more ridiculous than\r\nthe Member of the Second Chamber in the consciousness of his dignity.\r\nIf foreign events do not take place, and those we over-smart Diet\r\npeople can neither direct nor prognosticate, I know quite definitely\r\nnow what we shall have accomplished in one, two, or five years, and am\r\nwilling to effect it in twenty-four hours if the others will but be\r\ntruthful and sensible for a single day. I have never doubted that they\r\nall use water for cooking; but such an insipid, silly water-broth, in\r\nwhich not a single bubble of mutton-suet is visible, surprises me.\r\nSend me Filöhr, the village-mayor, Stephen Lotke, and Herr von\r\nDombrowsky, of the turnpike-house, as soon as they are washed and\r\ncombed, and I shall cut a dash with them in diplomatic circles. I am\r\nmaking headlong progress in the art of saying nothing by using, many\r\nwords; I write reports of many pages, which read nice and smooth as\r\neditorials; and if Manteuffel, after he has read them, can tell what\r\nthey contain, he can do more than I. Each of us makes believe that he\r\nthinks the other is full of ideas and plans, if he would but speak\r\nout, and yet we none of us know a jot better than the man in the moon\r\ndoes what is to become of Germany. No mortal, not even the most\r\nmalevolently skeptical Democrat, will believe what a vast amount of\r\ncharlatanism and consequential pomposity there is in this diplomacy.\r\nBut now I have done enough scolding, and want to tell you that I am\r\nwell, and that I was very glad and gave thanks to the Lord that,\r\naccording to your last letter, all was well with you, and that I love\r\nyou very much, and look at every pretty villa, thinking that perhaps\r\nour _babies_ will be running about in it in summer. Do see that you\r\nget the girls to come along, or if they absolutely refuse, bring\r\nothers from there with whom we are already somewhat acquainted. I\r\ndon't care to have a Frankfort snip in the room, or with the children;\r\nor we must take a Hessian girl, with short petticoats and ridiculous\r\nhead-gear; they are half-way rural and honest. For the present I shall\r\nrent a furnished room for myself in the city; the inn here is too\r\nexpensive. Lodgings, 5 guilders per day; two cups of tea, without\r\nanything else, 36 kreutzers (35 are 10 silbergroschen), and, served as\r\nthe style is here, it is insulting. Day before yesterday I was at\r\nMayence; it is a charming region, indeed. The rye is already standing\r\nin full ears, although the weather is infamously cold every night and\r\nmorning. The excursions by rail are the best things here. To\r\nHeidelberg, Baden-Baden, Odenwald, Hamburg, Soden, Wiesbaden, Bingen,\r\nRüdesheim, Niederwald, is a leisurely day's journey; one can stay\r\nthere for five or six hours and be here again in the evening; hitherto\r\nI have not yet availed myself of it, but shall do so, so that I may\r\nescort you when you are here. Rochow left for Warsaw at nine o'clock\r\nlast night; he will arrive there day after tomorrow at noon, and will\r\nmost likely be here again a week from today. About politics and\r\nindividuals cannot write you much, because most letters are opened,\r\nWhen once they are familiar with your address on my letters and with\r\nyour handwriting on yours, they will probably get over it, because\r\nthey have no time to read family letters. Do not be afraid of the\r\nlocal aristocracy; as to money, Rothschild is the most aristocratic,\r\nbut deprive them _all_ of their money and salaries, and it would be\r\nseen how little each one is aristocratic in himself; money doesn't do\r\nit, and otherwise--may the Lord keep me in humility, but here the\r\ntemptation is strong to be content with one's self.\r\n\r\nCountess Pückler, sister of the Countess Stolberg, resides at\r\nWeistritz, near Schweidnitz. Now, farewell; I must go out. God's\r\nblessing be with you. Give F. and M. much love. Your most faithful v.\r\nB.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrankfort, May 27, '51.\r\n\r\n_My Darling_,--* * * On Friday there was a ball at Lady Cowley's,\r\nwhich lasted until five in the morning; they all dance here as if\r\npossessed; the oldest delegates of fifty, with white hair, danced to\r\nthe end of the cotillion, in the sweat of their brows. At midnight\r\n\"God Save the Queen\" was solemnly played, because her birthday was\r\ndawning, and it was all a transparency of English coats-of-arms and\r\ncolors from top to bottom, and very many odd, stiff ladies, who \"lisp\r\nEnglish when they lie,\" as I read once upon a time the translation of\r\nthat passage in _Faust_; that is to say, they all have a passion for\r\ntalking bad French, and I am altogether forgetting my English, as I\r\nhave discovered to my dismay. * * * Oftentimes I feel terribly\r\nhomesick, and that is to me an agreeable sadness, for otherwise I seem\r\nto myself so aged, so dryly resigned and documentary, as if I were\r\nonly pasted on a piece of card-board. * * * Give your dear parents my\r\nheartfelt love, and kiss Annie's pretty hand for me, because she stays\r\nwith you so sweetly-Now, I shall not write another word until I have a\r\nletter from you in hand. Yesterday I attended the Lutheran church\r\nhere; a not very gifted, but devout, minister; the audience consisted,\r\napart from myself, of just twenty two women, and my appearance was\r\nvisibly an event. God bless and keep you and the children.\r\n\r\nYour most faithful v.B.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRINCESS BISMARCK]\r\n\r\n\r\nFrankfort, Ascension Day--Evening.\r\n\r\n(Postmarked Berlin, June 1, '51.)\r\n\r\n_My Heart_,--How good it is of you all that, directly after I had\r\nmailed my complaint of lack of news, there arrives such a shower of\r\nletters. A thousand thanks to your dear parents, and I shall answer\r\ndad tomorrow, when I am less hurried than today, for on this dear\r\nholiday, after a big dinner, I must still write some long despatches.\r\nI was at the French church today, where at least there was more\r\ncongregation and devotion, and the minister was passable, too, but I\r\ncannot talk French with my dear, faithful Lord and Saviour; it seems\r\nto me ungrateful. For the rest, they sang pretty hymns, these insipid\r\nCalvinists, almost in the sweet Catholic tune which you always\r\nplay. * * *\r\n\r\nYour most faithful v.B.\r\n\r\nYour letter had been opened again.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrankfort, June 4, '51.\r\n\r\n_My Darling_,--Were you not going to write to me any more? I was\r\nresolved even yesterday not to put pen to paper until I should have a\r\nletter from you, but, anyway, I will be good, and tell you that I am\r\nwell and love you, even if you let your little inkstand dry up. I long\r\nexceedingly for you and the children, and for quiet, comfortable\r\ndomesticity at Schönhausen or Reinfeld. As soon as I have finished my\r\nhitherto rather unimportant occupations, my empty lodgings, and the\r\nwhole dreary world behind, face me, and I know not where to set my\r\nfoot, for there is nothing which particularly attracts me. Day before\r\nyesterday I ate at Biberich, with the Duke of Nassau, the first fresh\r\nherrings and the first strawberries and raspberries of the season. It\r\nis certainly a delightful piece of earth along the Rhine, and I looked\r\npensively from the castle windows over to the red cathedral of\r\nMayence, which, almost four years ago, we both went to see very early\r\nin the morning, in times for which we were not then sufficiently\r\ngrateful to God; I remembered how, on board the steamer, the blue\r\nhills before us, we passed by the Duke's handsome castle, without\r\ndreaming how and why I should stand there at the window this year, an\r\nold wig of a Minister before me, who unravelled his views on national\r\npolities, while I was thinking, with an occasional absent-minded\r\n\"Quite so,\" of our trip of '47, and sought with my eyes the spot on\r\nthe Mayence bridge whence you, in your little Geneva coat, embarked on\r\nthe steamer; and then I thought of Geneva. * * * Countess Thun\r\nunfortunately left on Sunday for Tetschen, to spend three months with\r\nher father-in-law. She is a kindly lady, womanly and devout (Catholic,\r\nvery), attributes which do not grace the women here in general; her\r\nhusband gambles and flirts, I believe, more so than is agreeable to\r\nher. I hardly believe that you will like her, but she is one of the\r\nbetter specimens of women of the great world, even though that just\r\nproves to me that a woman of that world would not have been suitable\r\nfor me; I like her to associate with, but not to marry. Perhaps, by\r\ncomparing her with the others of her sort, you will learn to\r\nappreciate her. The gentlemen are unendurable. The moment I accost one\r\nhe assumes a diplomatic countenance, and thinks of what he can answer\r\nwithout saying too much, and what he can write home concerning my\r\nutterances. Those who are not so I find still less congenial; they\r\ntalk equivocally to the ladies, and the latter encourage them\r\nshamefully. It makes a less morbid impression on me if a woman falls\r\nthoroughly for once, but preserves a sense of shame at heart, than if\r\nshe takes pleasure in such chatter; and I value the Countess Thun,\r\nbecause, despite the general fashion prevailing here, she knows how to\r\nkeep decidedly clear of all that sort of thing. * * * Your most\r\nfaithful v.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrankfort, June 26, '51.\r\n\r\n_My Darling_,--Today I have been suffering all day long from\r\nhomesickness. I received your letter of Sunday early, and then I sat\r\nin the window and smelled the summer fragrance of roses and all sorts\r\nof shrubs in the little garden, and while so doing I heard one of your\r\ndear Beethoven pieces, played by an unknown hand on the piano, wafted\r\nover from some window opposite, distantly and in snatches, and to me\r\nit sounded prettier than any concert. I kept wondering why I must,\r\nafter all, be so far away, for a long time, from you and the children,\r\nwhile so many people who do not love each other at all see one another\r\nfrom morning till night. It is now seven months since I received at\r\nReinfeld the order to join the regiment; since then we have twice paid\r\neach other a hasty visit, and it will be eight or nine months before\r\nwe shall be again united. It must, indeed, be the Lord's will, for I\r\nhave not sought it, and when I am sorrowful it is a consolation to me\r\nthat I did not speak a syllable in order to come here, and that\r\nambition for outward pomp was not what led me to this separation. We\r\nare not in this world to be happy and to enjoy, but to do our duty;\r\nand the less my condition is a self-made one, the more do I realize\r\nthat I am to perform the duties of the office in which I am placed.\r\nAnd I certainly do not wish to be ungrateful, for I am, nevertheless,\r\nhappy in the knowledge of possessing so much that is dear, even if far\r\naway from here, and in the hope of a happy reunion. On the arrival of\r\nevery letter from Reinfeld my first feeling is one of hearty gratitude\r\nfor the unmerited happiness that I still have you in this world, and\r\nwith every death of wife or child which I see in the newspaper the\r\nconsciousness of what I have to lose comes forcibly home to me, and of\r\nwhat the merciful God has granted and thus far preserved to me. Would\r\nthat gratitude therefor might so dispose my obstinate and worldly\r\nheart to receive the mercy of the Lord that it shall not be necessary\r\nfor Him to chastise me in what I love, for I have greater fear of that\r\nthan of any other evil. * * * In a few weeks it must be decided\r\nwhether I shall be made Envoy here or stay at Reinfeld. The Austrians\r\nat Berlin are agitating against my appointment, because my\r\nblack-and-white is not sufficiently yellow for them; but I hardly\r\nbelieve they will succeed, and you, my poor dear, will probably have\r\nto jump into the cold water of diplomacy; and the boy, unlucky wight\r\nthat he is, will have a South-German accent added to his Berlin\r\nnativity. * * * As far as can now be foreseen, I shall not be able to\r\nget away from this galley for two or three weeks, for, including\r\nSilesia, that amount of time would probably be necessary for it. But\r\nmuch water will flow down the Main before then, and I am not worrying\r\nbefore the time comes. How I should like to turn suddenly around the\r\nbushy corner of the lawn and surprise all of you in the hall! I see\r\nyou so plainly, attending to the children, covering up Midget, with\r\nsensible speeches, and father sitting at his desk smoking, the mayor\r\nbeside him, and mammy bolt-upright on her sofa, by wretched light, one\r\nhand lying on the arm-rest, or holding _Musée Français_ close before\r\nher eyes. God grant that at this moment everything at Reinfeld is\r\ngoing as smoothly as this. I have at last received a letter from Hans,\r\none that is very charming, and, contrary to his custom, mysterious, in\r\nview of the post-office spies. You may imagine how Senfft writes to me\r\nunder these circumstances. I received an unsigned letter from him the\r\nother day, out of which the most quick-witted letter-bandit would have\r\nbeen at a loss to decipher what he was driving at. If you occasionally\r\ncome across some unintelligible notices at the tail end of the\r\n_Observer_, they will thus seem to you more puzzling still, and to the\r\nblockhead who breaks open this letter they will remain unintelligible,\r\neven if I tell you that they are a part of my correspondence. Only\r\ngive me frequent tidings, my beloved heart, even if short ones, so\r\nthat I may have the assurance that you are alive and well. A have\r\npicked the enclosed leaves for you in the garden of old Amschel\r\nRothschild, whom I like, because he is simply a haggling Jew, and does\r\nnot pretend to be anything else, and, at the same time, a strictly\r\northodox Jew, who touches nothing at his dinners, and eats only\r\n\"undefiled\" food. \"Johann dage vid you some bread for de deers,\" he\r\nsaid his servant as he came out to show me his garden, in which there\r\nwere some tame fallow deer. \"Baron, dat blant costs me two thousand\r\nguilders, honor bride, two thousand guilders gash; I vill let you have\r\nit for one thousand or, if you vant it for nuddings, he shall bring id\r\nto your house. God knows I abbrejiate you highly, Baron; you are a\r\nnize man, a brave man.\" With that he is a little, thin gray imp of a\r\nman, the patriarch of his tribe, but a poor man in his palace,\r\nchildless, a widower, cheated by his servants, and ill-treated by\r\naristocratically Frenchified and Anglicized nephews and nieces who\r\nwill inherit his treasures without gratitude and without love.\r\nGood-night, my angel. The clock is striking twelve; I want to go to\r\nbed and read chap. ii. of the Second Epistle of St. Peter. I am now\r\ndoing that in a systematic way, and, when I have finished St. Peter,\r\nat your recommendation I shall read the He-brews, which I do not know\r\nat all as yet. May God's protection and blessing be with you all.\r\n\r\nYour most faithful v.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrankfort, July 3, 1851.\r\n\r\n_My Pet_,--Day before yesterday I very thankfully received your letter\r\nand the tidings that you are all well. But do not forget when you\r\nwrite to me that the letters are opened not by me alone, but by all\r\nsorts of postal spies, and don't berate particular persons so much in\r\nthem, for all that is immediately reported and debited to my account;\r\nbesides, you do people injustice. Concerning my appointment or\r\nnon-appointment I know nothing as yet, except what was told me when I\r\nleft; everything else is possibilities and surmises. The only\r\ncrookedness about the matter us far has been the government's silence\r\ntowards me, for it would have been only fair to let me know by this,\r\nand officially at that, whether during next month I to live here or in\r\nPomerania with wife and child. Be careful in your remarks to every one\r\nthere, without exception, not to Massow alone; particularly in your\r\ncriticisms of individuals, for you have no idea what one experiences\r\nin this respect after once becoming an object of surveillance; be\r\nprepared to see warmed up with sauce, here or at Sans Souci, what you\r\nmay perhaps whisper to Charlotte[17] or Annie in the boscages or the\r\nbathing-house. Forgive me for being so admonitory, but after your last\r\nletter I have to take the diplomatic pruning-knife in hand a bit. Do\r\nnot write me anything that the police may not read and communicate to\r\nKing, ministers, or Rochow. If the Austrians and many other folks can\r\nsucceed in sowing distrust in our camp, they will thereby attain one\r\nof the principal objects of their letter-pilfering. Day before\r\nyesterday I took dinner at Wiesbaden, with Dewitz, and, with a mixture\r\nof sadness and knowing wisdom, I inspected the scenes of past\r\nfoolishness. Would that it might please God to fill with His clear and\r\nstrong wine this vessel, in which at that time the champagne of\r\ntwenty-two-year-old youth sparkled uselessly away, leaving stale dregs\r\nbehind. Where and how may Isabella Loraine and Miss Russel be living\r\nnow? How many of those with whom I then flirted, tippled, and played\r\ndice are now dead and buried! How many transformations has my view of\r\nthe world undergone in the fourteen years which have since elapsed,\r\nwhile I always considered the existing one as alone correct! and how\r\nmuch is now small to me which then appeared great, how much now\r\ndeserving of respect which I then ridiculed! How many a green bud\r\nwithin us may still come to mature blossom and wither worthlessly away\r\nbefore another period of fourteen years is over, in 1865, if we are\r\nthen still alive! I cannot realize how a person who is thoughtful and,\r\nnevertheless, knows nothing or wishes to know nothing of God, can\r\nendure giving a despised and tedious life, a life which is fleeting as\r\na stream, as a sleep, even as a blade of grass that soon withers; we\r\nspend our years as in a babble of talk.\r\n\r\nI do not know how I endured it in the past; if I should live now as I\r\ndid then, without God, without you, without children, I should, in\r\nfact, be at a loss to know why I should not cast off this life like a\r\nsoiled shirt; and yet most of my acquaintances are thus, and they\r\nlive. If in the case of some one individual I ask myself what reason\r\nhe can have, in his own mind, for continuing to live, to toil, to\r\nfret, to intrigue, and to spy--verily I do not know. Do not conclude\r\nfrom this scribbling that I happen to be in a particularly black mood;\r\non the contrary, I feel as when, on a beautiful September day, one\r\ncontemplates the yellowing foliage; healthy and gay, but a little\r\nsadness, a little homesickness, a longing for woods, lake, meadow, you\r\nand the children, all mingled with the sunset and a Beethoven\r\nsymphony. Instead of that I must now call upon tiresome serene\r\nHighnesses and read endless figures about German sloops of war and\r\ncannon-yawls which are rotting at Bremerhaven and devouring\r\ncash. * * * Farewell, my beloved heart. Much love to our parents, and\r\nGod keep you all.\r\n\r\nYour most faithful v.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrankfort, July 8, 1851.\r\n\r\n_My Darling_,--Yesterday and today I wished very much to write to you,\r\nbut owing to a hurly burly of business I have not been able to do so\r\ntill now, late in the evening, after returning from a walk during\r\nwhich, in the charming summer-night's air, with moonlight and the\r\nrustling of poplar-leaves, I have brushed off the dust of the day's\r\ndocuments. On Saturday, in the afternoon, I went with Rochow and Lynar\r\nto Rüdesheim, hired a boat there, rowed out on the Rhine, and swam in\r\nthe moonlight, nothing but nose and eyes over the tepid water, as far\r\nas the Mouse Tower near Bingen, where the wicked bishop met his death.\r\nThere is something strangely dreamlike in thus lying in the water on a\r\nquiet, warm night, carried gently along by the tide, seeing only the\r\nsky with moon and stars, and, alongside, the wooded hill-tops and the\r\ncastle battlements in the moonlight, hearing nothing but the gentle\r\npurling of one's own motion. I should like to swim thus every evening.\r\nThen I drank some very nice wine, and sat for a long time smoking,\r\nwith Lynar, on the balcony, the Rhine beneath us. My little Testament\r\nand the starry firmament caused our conversation to turn on Christian\r\ntopics, and I hammered for a long time at the Rousseau-like chastity\r\nof his soul, with no other effect than to cause him to remain silent.\r\nHe was ill-treated while a child by nurses and private tutors, without\r\nhaving really learned to know his parents, and by reason of a similar\r\nbringing-up he has retained from his youthful days opinions similar to\r\nmy own, but has always been more satisfied with them than I ever was.\r\nNext morning we went by steamer to Coblentz, breakfasted there for an\r\nhour, and returned by the same route to Frankfort, where we arrived in\r\nthe evening. I really undertook the expedition with the object of\r\nvisiting old Metternich at Johannisberg; he had invited me, but the\r\nRhine pleased me so much that I preferred to take a pleasure ride to\r\nCoblentz, and postponed the call. You and I saw him that time on our\r\ntrip directly after the Alps, and in bad weather; on this summer\r\nmorning, and after the dusty tedium of Frankfort, he again rose high\r\nin my esteem. I promise myself much relish from spending a few days\r\nwith you at Rüdesheim, the place is so quiet and country-like, good\r\npeople and low-priced, and then we shall hire a little rowboat, ride\r\nleisurely down, climb the Niederwald, and this and that castle, and\r\nreturn by the steamer. One can leave here early in the morning, remain\r\nfor eight hours at Rüdesheim, Bingen, Rheinstein, etc., and be here\r\nagain at night. My appointment at this place does not appear to be\r\ncertain, and Hans is going to Coblentz as Lord-Lieutenant; will live\r\nthere in a stately palace, with the finest view in all Prussia. By\r\nleaving here early, one reaches Coblentz by half past ten, and is back\r\nin the evening; that is easier than from Reinfeld to Reddentin, and a\r\nprettier road. You see we are not forsaken here; but who would have\r\nthought, when we went to the wedding in Kiekow, that both of us should\r\nbe removed from our innocent Pomeranian solitude and hurled to the\r\nsummits of life, speaking in worldly fashion, to political outposts on\r\nthe Rhine? The ways of the Lord are passing strange. May He likewise\r\ntake our souls out of their darkness and lift them to the bright\r\nsummits of His grace. _That_ position would be more secure. But He has\r\ncertainly taken us visibly into His hand, and will not let me fall,\r\neven though I sometimes make myself a heavy weight. The interview with\r\nLynar the other day has truly enabled me to cast a grateful (but not\r\npharisaical) glance over the distance which lies between me and my\r\nprevious unbelief; may it increase continually, until it has attained\r\nthe proper measure. * * * I am already beginning to look about here\r\nfor a house, preferably outside of the city, with a garden; there my\r\ndarling will have to play a very stiff, self-contained part, see much\r\ntedious society, give dinners and balls, and assume terribly\r\naristocratic airs. What do you say to having dancing at your house\r\nuntil far into the night? Probably it cannot be avoided, my beloved\r\nheart--that is part of the \"service.\" I can see mother's blue eyes\r\ngrow big with wonder at the thought. I am going to bed, to read\r\nCorinthians i., 3, and pray God to preserve you all to me, and grant\r\nyou a quiet night and health and peace. Dearest love to your parents.\r\n\r\nYour most faithful\r\n\r\nv.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrankfort, April 4, '52.\r\n\r\n_Dear Mother_,--I wished to write you today at length, but I do not\r\nknow how far I shall progress in it after having given myself up for\r\nso long to enjoyment of Sunday leisure, by taking a long, loitering\r\nwalk in the woods, that hardly an hour remains before the closing of\r\nthe mail. I found such pretty, solitary paths, quite narrow, between\r\nthe greening hazel and thorn-bushes, where only the thrush and the\r\nglede-kite were heard, and quite far off the bell of the church to\r\nwhich I was playing truant, that I could not find my way home again.\r\nJohanna is somewhat exhausted, in connection with her condition, or I\r\nshould have had her in the woods, too, and perhaps we should still be\r\nthere. * * * She has presented me with an exquisite anchor watch, of\r\nwhich I was much in need, because I always wore her small one. In the\r\nVincke matter I cannot, with you, sufficiently praise God's mercy that\r\nno misfortune has occurred from any side. I believe that for me it was\r\ninwardly very salutary to have felt myself so near unto death, and\r\nprepared myself for it; I know that you do not share my conception of\r\nsuch matters, but I have never felt so firm in believing trust, and so\r\nresigned to God's will, as I did in the moment when the matter was in\r\nprogress. We can discuss it orally some time; now I only want to tell\r\nyou how it happened. I had repeatedly been disgusted by V.'s rudeness\r\nto the government and ourselves, and was prepared resolutely to oppose\r\nhim at the next opportunity that offered. He accused me of want of\r\ndiplomatic discretion, and said that hitherto the \"burning cigar\" was\r\nmy only known achievement. He alluded to an occurrence at the Palace\r\nof the Diet, of which I had previously told him confidentially, at his\r\nparticular request, as of something quite unimportant, but comical. I\r\nthen retorted from the platform that his remark overstepped not only\r\nthe bounds of diplomatic but also of ordinary discretion, which one\r\nhad a right to demand from every man of education. Next day he\r\nchallenged me, through Herr von Sauken-Julienfelde, for four\r\npistol-shots; I accepted it after Oscar Arnim's proposal, that we\r\nshould fight with swords, had been declined by Sauken. Vincke wished\r\nto defer the matter for forty-eight hours, which I granted. On the\r\n25th, at 8 A.M., we rode to Tegel; to a charming spot in the woods by\r\nthe seashore; it was beautiful weather, and the birds sang so gayly in\r\nthe sunshine that, as soon as we entered the wood, all sad thoughts\r\nleft me; only the thought of Johanna I had to drive from me by force,\r\nso as not to be affected by it. With me as witnesses were Arnim and\r\nEberhard Stolberg, and my brother as very dejected spectator. With V.\r\nwere Sauken, and Major Vincke of the First Chamber, as well as a\r\nBodelschwingh (nephew of the Minister and of Vincke), as impartial\r\nwitness. The latter declared before the matter began that the\r\nchallenge seemed to him to be, under the circumstances, too stringent,\r\nand proposed that it should be modified to one shot apiece. Sauken, in\r\nV.'s name, was agreeable to this, and had word brought to me that the\r\nwhole thing should be called off if I declared I was sorry for my\r\nremark. As I could not truthfully do this, we took our positions,\r\nfired at Bodelschwingh's command, and both missed. God forgive the\r\ngrave sin that I did not at once recognize His mercy, but I cannot\r\ndeny it: when I looked through the smoke and saw my adversary standing\r\nerect, a feeling of disappointment prevented me from participating in\r\nthe general rejoicing, which caused Bodelschwingh to shed tears; the\r\nmodification of the challenge annoyed me, and I would gladly have\r\ncontinued the combat. But, as I was not the insulted party, I could\r\nsay nothing; it was over, and all shook hands. We rode home and I ate\r\nwith my sister alone. All the world was dissatisfied with the outcome,\r\nbut the Lord must know what He still intends to make of V. In cool\r\nblood, I am certainly very grateful that it happened so. What probably\r\ncontributed much to it was the fact that a couple of very good\r\npistols, which were originally intended to be used, were so loaded\r\nthat for the moment they were quite useless, and we had to take those\r\nintended for the seconds, with which it was difficult to hit. An\r\nofficial disturbance has interrupted me, and now I must close--time is\r\nup. Only I still want to say that I had consulted beforehand, about\r\nthe duel, with old Stolberg, General Gerlach, Minister Uhden and Hans;\r\nthey were all of opinion that it must be; Büchsel, too, saw no\r\nalternative, although he admonished me to desist. I spent an hour in\r\nprayer, with him and Stolberg, the evening before. I never doubted\r\nthat I should have to appear, but I did doubt whether I should shoot\r\nat V. I did it without anger, and missed. Now farewell, my dearly\r\nbeloved mother. Give love to father and every one from\r\n\r\nYour faithful son, v.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nVienna, June 14, '52.\r\n\r\n_My Beloved Heart_,--At this hour I ought to sit down and write\r\na long report to his Majesty concerning a lengthy and fruitless\r\nnegotiation which I had today with Count Buol, and concerning an\r\naudience with the Archduchess Empress-Dowager. But I have just taken\r\na promenade on the high ramparts all round the inner city, and from\r\nthem seen a charming sunset behind the Leopoldsberg, and now I am much\r\nmore inclined to think of you than of business. I stood for a long\r\ntime on the red Thor Tower, which commands a view of the Jägerzeil\r\nand of our old-time domicile, the Lamb, with the café before it; at\r\nthe Archduchess' I was in a room which opens on the homelike little\r\ngarden into which we once secretly and thoughtlessly found our way;\r\nyesterday I heard _Lucia_--Italian, very good; all this so stirs\r\nmy longing for you that I am quite sad and incapable. For it is terrible\r\nto be thus alone in the world, when one is no longer accustomed to it; I\r\nam in quite a Lynaric mood. Nothing but calls, and coming to know\r\nstrangers, with whom I am always having the same talk. Every one knows\r\nthat I have not yet been here very long, but whether I was ever here\r\nbefore; that is the great question which I have answered two hundred\r\ntimes in these days, and happy that that topic still remains. For folk\r\nbent on pleasure this may be a very pretty place, for it offers whatever\r\nis capable of affording outward diversion to people. But I am longing\r\nfor Frankfort as if it were Kniephof, and do not wish to come here by\r\nany means. F. must lie just where the sun went down, over the\r\nMannhartsberg yonder; and, while it was sinking here, it still continued\r\nshining with you for over half an hour. It is terribly far. How\r\ndifferent it was with you here my heart, and with Salzburg and Meran in\r\nprospect; I have grown terribly old since then. * * * It is very cruel\r\nthat we must spend such a long period of our brief life apart; that time\r\nis lost, then, and cannot be brought back. God alone knows why He allows\r\nothers to remain together who are quite at their ease when apart; like\r\nan aged friend of mine, who travelled with me as far as Dresden had to\r\nsit in the same compartment with his wife all the time, and could not\r\nsmoke; and we must always correspond at a great distance. We shall make\r\nup for it all, and love each other a great deal more when we are again\r\ntogether; if only we keep well! Then I shall not murmur. Today I had the\r\ngreat pleasure of receiving, _via_ Berlin, your letter of last Thursday;\r\nthat is the second one since I left Frankfort; surely none is lost? I\r\nwas very happy and thankful that all of you are well. * * * As soon as I\r\nfind myself once more on the old, tiresome Thuringian railroad I shall\r\nbe out of myself, and still more so when I catch a glimpse of our light\r\nfrom Bockenheim; I must travel about nine hundred miles thither, not\r\nincluding two hundred and fifty miles from Pesth back to this place. How\r\ngladly I shall undertake them, once I am seated in the train! I shall\r\nprobably abandon my trip by way of Munich; from this place to M. is a\r\npost-trip of fifty hours; by water still longer; and I shall have to\r\nrender a verbal report in Berlin, anyway. About politics I can,\r\nfortunately, write nothing; for, even if the English courier who takes\r\nthis to Berlin is a safeguard against our post-office, the Taxis\r\nscoundrels will, nevertheless, get hold of it.\r\n\r\nBe sure to write me detailed information as to your personal\r\ncondition. Greet mother, our relations, if they are still there,\r\nLeontine, the children, Stolberg, Wentzel, and all the rest. Farewell\r\nmy angel. God preserve you.\r\n\r\nYour most faithful v.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nOfen, June 23, '52.\r\n\r\n_My Darling_,--I have just left the steamer, and do not know how\r\nbetter to utilize the moment at my disposal until Hildebrand follows\r\nwith my things than by sending you a love-token from this far-easterly\r\nbut pretty spot. The Emperor has graciously assigned me quarters in\r\nhis palace, and I am sitting here in a large vaulted chamber at the\r\nopen window, into which the evening bells of Pesth are pealing. The\r\nview outward is charming. The castle stands high; immediately below me\r\nthe Danube, spanned by the suspension-bridge; behind it Pesth, which\r\nwould remind you of Dantzig, and farther away the endless plain\r\nextending far beyond Pesth, disappearing in the bluish-red dusk of\r\nevening. To the left of Pesth I look up the Danube, far, very far,\r\naway; to my left, _i.e._, on the right-hand shore, it is fringed first\r\nby the city of Ofen, behind it hills like the Berici near Venetia blue\r\nand bluer, then bluish-red in the evening sky, which glows behind. In\r\nthe midst of both cities is the large sheet of water as at Linz,\r\nintersected by the suspension-bridge and a wooded island. It is really\r\nsplendid; only you, my angel, are lacking for me to enjoy this\r\nprospect _with you_; then it would be _quite_ nice. Then, too, the\r\nroad hither, at least from Gran to Pesth, would have pleased you.\r\nImagine Odenwald and Taunus moved close together, the waters of the\r\nDanube filling the interval; and occasionally, particularly near\r\nWisserad, a little Dürrenstein-Agstein. The shady side of the trip was\r\nthe sunny side; it burned as if they wanted tokay to grow on the\r\nsteamer, and the crowd of travelers was large; but, just imagine, not\r\none Englishman; it must be that they have not yet discovered Hungary.\r\nFor the rest, there were queer fellows enough, dirty and washed, of\r\nall Oriental and Occidental nations. * * * By this time I am becoming\r\nimpatient as to Hildebrand's whereabouts; I am lying in the window,\r\nhalf musing in the moonlight, half waiting for him as for a mistress,\r\nfor I long for a clean shirt. * * * If you were here for only a\r\nmoment, and could contemplate now the dull, silvery Danube, the dark\r\nhills on a pale-red background, and the lights which are shining up\r\nfrom Pesth below, Vienna would lose much in your estimation compared\r\nto Buda-Pescht, as the Hungarian calls it. You see I am not only a\r\nlover, but also an enthusiast, for nature. Now I shall soothe my\r\nexcited blood with a cup of tea, after Hildebrand has actually put in\r\nan appearance, and shall then go to bed and dream of you, my love.\r\nLast night I had only four hours of sleep, and the court here is\r\nterribly matutinal; the young gentleman himself rises as early as five\r\no 'clock, so that I should be a bad courtier if I were to sleep much\r\nlonger. Therefore I bid you good-night from afar, with a side-glance\r\nat a gigantic teapot and an enticing plate of cold jellied cuts,\r\ntongue, as I see, among the rest. Where did I get that song that\r\noccurs to me continually today--\"_Over the blue mountain, over the\r\nwhite sea-foam, come, thou beloved one, come to thy lonely home_\"? I\r\ndon't know who must have sung that to me, some time in _auld lang\r\nsyne_. May God's angels keep you today as hitherto.\r\n\r\nYour most faithful v.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 24th.\r\n\r\nAfter having slept very well, although on a wedge-shaped pillow, I bid\r\nyou good-morning, my heart. The whole panorama before me is bathed in\r\nsuch a bright, burning sun that I cannot look out at all without being\r\nblinded. Until I begin my calls I am sitting here breakfasting and\r\nsmoking all alone in a very spacious apartment--four rooms, all\r\nthickly vaulted, two something like our dining-room in size, thick\r\nwalls as at Schönhausen, gigantic nut-wood closets, blue silk\r\nfurnishings, a profusion of large spots on the floor, an ell in size,\r\nwhich a more excited fancy than mine might take for blood, but which I\r\ndecidedly declare to be ink; an unconscionably awkward scribe must\r\nhave lodged here, or another Luther repeatedly hurled big inkstands\r\nat his opponents. * * * Exceedingly strange figures, brown, with broad\r\nhats and wide trousers, are floating about on long wooden rafts in the\r\nDanube below. I regret I am not an artist; I should like to let you\r\nsee these wild faces, mustached, long-haired with excited black eyes,\r\nand the ragged, picturesque drapery which hangs about them, as they\r\nappeared to me all day yesterday. * * * Farewell, my heart. God bless\r\nyou and our present and future children.\r\n\r\nYour most faithful v.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvening.\r\n\r\nI have not yet found an opportunity to send this. Again the lights are\r\nshining up from Pesth, lightning appears on the horizon in the\r\ndirection of the Theiss, and there is starlight above us. I have been\r\nin uniform most of the day, handed my credentials to the young ruler\r\nof this country at a solemn audience, and received a very pleasing\r\nimpression of him--twenty-year-old vivacity, coupled with studied\r\ncomposure. He _can_ be very winning, I have seen that; whether he\r\nalways will, I do not know, and he need not, for that matter. At any\r\nrate, he is for this country exactly what it needs, and more than that\r\nfor the peace of its neighbors, if God does not give him a\r\npeace-loving heart. After dinner all the court went on an excursion\r\ninto the mountains, to a romantic spot called the Pretty Shepherdess,\r\nwho has long been dead, King Matthias Corvinus having loved her many\r\nhundred years ago. Thence the view is over woody hills, like those on\r\nthe Neckar banks to Ofen, its castle, and the plain. A popular\r\nfestival had brought thousands up to it, and the Emperor, who mingled\r\nwith them, was surrounded with noisy cheers; Czardas danced, waltzed,\r\nsang, played, climbed into the trees, and crowded the court-yard. On a\r\ngrassy slope was a supper-table of about twenty persons, sitting along\r\none side only, leaving the other free for a view of wood, hill, city,\r\nand country, high beeches over us, with Hungarians climbing among the\r\nbranches; behind us a densely crowded and crowding mass of people near\r\nby, and, beyond, alternate horn-music and singing, wild gipsy\r\nmelodies. Illumination, moonlight, and evening glow, interspersed with\r\ntorches through the wood; the whole might have been served, unaltered,\r\nas a great scenic effect in a romantic opera. Beside me sat the\r\nwhitebearded Archbishop of Gran, primate of Hungary, in a black silk\r\ntalar, with a red cape; on the other side a very amiable and elegant\r\ngeneral of cavalry, Prince Liechtenstein. You see, the painting was\r\nrich in contrasts. Then we rode home by moonlight, escorted by\r\ntorches; and while I smoke my evening cigar I am writing to my\r\ndarling, and leaving the documents until tomorrow. * * * I have\r\nlistened today to the story of how this castle was stormed by the\r\ninsurgents three years ago, when the brave General Hentzi and the\r\nentire garrison were cut down after a wonderfully heroic defence. The\r\nblack spots on my floor are in part burns, and where I am now writing\r\nto you the shells then danced about, and the combat finally raged on\r\ntop of smoking _débris_. It was only put in order again a few weeks\r\nago, against the Emperor's arrival. Now it is very quiet and cozy up\r\nhere; I hear only the ticking of a clock and distant rolling of wheels\r\nfrom below. For the second time from this place I bid you good-night\r\nin the distance. May angels watch over you--a grenadier with a\r\nbear-skin cap does that for me here; I see his bayonet two arm-lengths\r\naway from me, projecting six inches above the windowsill, and\r\nreflecting my light. He is standing on the terrace over the Danube,\r\nand is, perhaps, thinking of his Nan, too.\r\n\r\n\r\nTomsjönäs, August 16, '57.\r\n\r\n_My Dearest,_--I make use again of the Sunday quiet to give you a sign\r\nof life, though I do not know what day there will be a chance to send\r\nit out of this wilderness to the mail. I rode about seventy miles\r\nwithout break, through the desolate forest, in order to reach here,\r\nand before me lie more than a hundred miles more before one gets to\r\nprovinces of arable land. Not a city, not a village, far and wide;\r\nonly single settlers in wide huts, with a little barley and potatoes,\r\nwho find rods of land to till, here and there between dead trees,\r\npieces of rock, and bushes. Picture to yourself about five hundred\r\nsquare miles of such desolate country as that around Viartlum, high\r\nheather, alternating with short grass and bog, and with birches,\r\njunipers pines, beeches, oaks, alders, here impenetrably thick, there\r\nthin and barren of foliage, the whole strewn with innumerable stones\r\nof all sizes up to that of a house, smelling of wild rosemary and\r\nrosin, at intervals wonderfully shaped lakes surrounded by woods and\r\nhills of the heath, then you have the land of Smaa, where I am just\r\nnow. Really, the land of my dreams, inaccessible to despatches,\r\ncolleagues, and Reitzenstein, but unfortunately, to you as well. I\r\nshould like ever so much to have a hunting-castle on one of these\r\nquiet lakes and inhabit it for some months with all the dear ones whom\r\nI think of now as assembled in Reinfeld. In winter, to be sure, it\r\nwould not be endurable here, especially in the mud that all the rain\r\nwould make. Yesterday we turned out at about five, hunted, in burning\r\nheat, up-hill and down, through bush and fen, until eleven, and found\r\nabsolutely nothing; walking in bogs and impenetrable juniper thickets,\r\non large stones and timbers, is very fatiguing. Then we slept in a\r\nhay-shed until two o'clock, drank lots of milk, and hunted again until\r\nsunset, bringing down twenty-five grouse and two mountain-hens. I shot\r\nfour of the former; Engel, to his great delight, one of the latter.\r\nThen we dined in the hunting-lodge, a remarkable wooden building on a\r\npeninsula in the lake. My sleeping-room and its three chairs, two\r\ntables, and bedstead are of no other color than that of the natural\r\npine-boards, like the whole house, whose walls are made of these. A\r\nsofa does not exist; bed very hard; but after such hardships as ours\r\none does not need to be rocked to sleep. From my window I see a\r\nblooming hill rise from the heath, on it birches rocking in the wind,\r\nand between them I see, in the lake mirror, pine-woods on the other\r\nside. Near the house a camp has been put up for hunters, drivers,\r\nservants, and peasants, then the barricade of wagons, a little city of\r\ndogs, eighteen or twenty huts on both sides of a lane which they form;\r\nfrom each a throng looks out tired from yesterday's hunt. * * *\r\n\r\n\r\nPetersburg, April 4, '59.\r\n\r\n_My Dear Heart_,--Now that the rush of today noon is past, I sit down\r\nin the evening to write you a few more lines in peace. When I closed\r\nmy letter today I did it with the intention of writing to you next a\r\nbirthday letter, and thought I had plenty of time for it; it is only\r\nthe 23d of March here. I have thought it over, and find that a letter\r\nmust go out today exactly to reach Frankfort on the 11th; it is hard\r\nto get used to the seven days' interval which the post needs. So I\r\nhurry my congratulations. May God grant you His rich blessing in soul\r\nand body, for all your love and truth, and give you resignation and\r\ncontentment in regard to the various new conditions of life, contrary\r\nto your inclinations, which you will meet here. We cannot get rid of\r\nthe sixtieth degree of latitude, and we have not chosen our own lot.\r\nMany live happily here, although the ice is still solid as rock, and\r\nmore snow fell in the night, and there are no garden and no Taunus\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nI could get along very well indeed here if I only knew the same of\r\nyou, and, above all, if I had you with me. All official matters--and\r\nin them rests really the calling which in this world has fallen to my\r\nlot, and which you, through your significant \"Yes\" in the Kolziglow\r\nchurch, are bound to help bear in joy and sorrow--all official matters\r\nare, in comparison with Frankfort, changed from thorns to roses;\r\nwhether they will ever blossom is, indeed, uncertain. The aggravations\r\nof the Diet and the palace venom look from here like childishness. If\r\nwe do not wantonly make ourselves disagreeable, we are welcome here.\r\nWhenever the carriages are called here, and \"_Prusku passlanika\"_\r\n(\"Prussian carriage\") is cried out among those waiting, then all the\r\nRussians look about with pleasant smiles, as though they had just\r\npopped down a ninety-degree glass of schnapps. There is some social\r\naffair every evening, and the people are different from those in\r\nFrankfort. Your aversion to court life will weaken. You cannot fail to\r\nlike the Czar; you have seen him already--have you not! He is\r\nextremely gracious to me, as well as the Czarina--the young Czarina, I\r\nmean. And it is easy to get along with the mother, in spite of her\r\nimposing presence. I dined with her today with the Meiendorfs and\r\nLoen,[18] and it was just like that dinner at our house with Prince\r\nCarl and the Princess Anna, when we enjoyed ourselves so much. In\r\nshort, only take courage, and things will come out all right. So far I\r\nhave only agreeable impressions; the only thing that provokes me is\r\nthat smoking is not allowed on the street. One can have no idea in\r\nwhat disfavor the Austrians are over here; a mangy dog will not take a\r\npiece of meat from them. I am sorry for poor Szechenyi; I do not\r\ndislike him. They will either drive things to a war from here, or let\r\nit come, and then they will stick the bayonet into the Austrians'\r\nbacks; however peacefully people talk, and however I try to soften\r\nthings down, as my duty demands, the hatred is unlimited, and goes\r\nbeyond all my expectations. Since coming here I begin to believe in\r\nwar. There seems to be no room in Russian politics for any other\r\nthought than how to strike at Austria. Even the quiet, mild Czar falls\r\ninto rage and fire whenever he talks about it, as does the Czarina,\r\nalthough a Darmstadt Princess; and it is touching when the Dowager\r\nCzarina talks of her husband's broken heart, and of Francis Joseph,\r\nwhom he loved as a son, really without anger, but as if speaking of\r\none who is exposed to God's vengeance. Now I have still much to write\r\nfor the carrier tomorrow, and this you will not receive, I suppose,\r\nuntil two days after your dear birthday, just when I am celebrating\r\nmine by the calendar here. Farewell, my dear, and give each child a\r\nsweet orange from me. Love to all.\r\n\r\nYour most faithful v.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nPetersburg, June 4, '59.\r\n\r\n_My Dear Heart_,--At last, day before yesterday, came the\r\nlong-yearned-for news from you, with the reassuring post-mark, Stolp.\r\nI could not go to sleep at all in the evening, because of anxious\r\npictures of my imagination, whose scenes were all the stopping-places\r\nbetween Berlin and Reinfeld. * * * Yesterday I dined at the Czarina's,\r\nin Zarske, where I found the Grand Princess Marie, who could tell me\r\nat least that she had seen you in Berlin, and that you were all right.\r\nOn the way back the Czar met me at the station, and took me into his\r\ncoupé--very conspicuous here for a civilian with such an old hat as I\r\ngenerally wear. In the evening I was, of course, on the islands, on a\r\nlively dark-brown horse, and drank tea there with a nice, old,\r\nwhite-haired Countess Stroganoff. The lilac, I must tell you, has\r\nflowered here as beautifully as in Frankfort, and the laburnum, too;\r\nand the nightingales warble so happily that it is hard to find a spot\r\non the islands where one does not hear them. In the city, during these\r\ndays, we had such unremitting heat as we almost never have at home.\r\nThe captain of the _Eagle_ told me that the temperature in southern\r\nPomerania was actually refreshing in comparison; with such short\r\nnights, too, the morning brings no real coolness, and I could ride or\r\ndrive about for hours in the mysterious gloaming which hovers at\r\nmidnight over the surface of the water, if the increasing brightness\r\ndid not give warning that another day is waiting with its work and\r\ncare, and that sleep demands its rights beforehand. Since I have had\r\nthe drosky, in which there is too little room for an interpreter, I am\r\nmaking, to the smirking delight of Dmitri, the coachman, progress in\r\nRussian, since there is nothing left for me to do but to speak it\r\n_tant bien que mal_. I am sorry that you have not been able to watch\r\nwith me the sudden awakening of spring here; as if it had suddenly\r\noccurred to her that she had overslept her time, she is putting on, in\r\ntwenty-four hours, her entire green dress, from head to foot. * * *\r\nThis whole preparation for war is somewhat premature, and is causing\r\nus unnecessary expense. I hope we shall come to our senses finally\r\nbefore setting all Europe on fire, for the sake of obliging some\r\nlittle princes, and, at our own cost, helping Austria in glory out of\r\nher embarrassment. We cannot allow Austria either to be annihilated\r\nor, through brilliant victory, to be strengthened in her feeling of\r\nself-confidence and to make us the footstool of her greatness. But\r\nthere is plenty of time for either case before we take the plunge, and\r\nmany a piece of Lombard water can be dyed red, for things will not go\r\nforward so easily as hitherto when the Austrians have once placed\r\nthemselves in their line of forts, as they should have done at the\r\nfirst. * * *\r\n\r\nIt is a misfortune that I always write to you in a steaming hurry; now\r\nthe foxy face of the chancery servant, who is in the police pay,\r\nbesides, is before me again already, and is hurrying me up, and\r\neverything I wanted to say is shrivelling before the fellow, who is\r\nuseful, however. I was just thinking of much more that I wanted to\r\nwrite, and now I do not know anything except that I should like to\r\nbeat him. * * * In the greatest love,\r\n\r\nYour most faithful v.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nMoscow, June 6, '59.\r\n\r\nA sign of life, at least, I want to send you from here, my dear, while\r\nI am waiting for the samovar, and a young Russian in a red shirt is\r\nstruggling, with vain attempts, to light a fire; he blows and sighs,\r\nbut it will not burn. After complaining so much before about the\r\nscorching heat I waked up today between Twer and here, and thought I\r\nwas dreaming when I saw the land and its fresh green covered far and\r\nwide with snow. Nothing surprises me any more so when I could no\r\nlonger be in doubt about the fact I turned quietly on my other side to\r\ncontinue sleeping and rolling on, although the play of the\r\ngreen-and-white colors in the morning red was not without charm. I do\r\nnot know whether the snow still lies about Twer; here it is all\r\nmelted, and a cool, gray rain is drizzling down on the sheet of roofs.\r\nRussia certainly has a perfect right to claim green as her color. Of\r\nthe four hundred and fifty miles hither I slept away one hundred and\r\neighty, but of the other two hundred and seventy every hand's-breadth\r\nwas green, of all shades. Cities and villages, especially houses, with\r\nthe exception of the stations, I did not notice; bushy forests,\r\nchiefly birches, cover swamps and hills, fine growth of grass under\r\nthem, long meadows between. So it goes for fifty, one hundred, one\r\nhundred and fifty miles. I don't remember to have noticed any fields,\r\nor any heather or sand; lonely grazing cows or horses waken in one now\r\nand then the conjecture that there are people, too, in the\r\nneighborhood. Moscow looks from above like a corn-field, the soldiers\r\ngreen, the furniture green, and I have no doubt that the eggs lying\r\nbefore me were laid by green hens. You will want to know how I happen\r\nto be here; I have asked myself the same question, and presently\r\nreceived the answer that variety is the spice of life. The truth of\r\nthis profound observation is especially obvious when one has been\r\nliving for ten weeks in a sunny hotel-room, looking out upon stone\r\npavements. Besides, one's senses become somewhat blunted to the joys\r\nof moving, if repeated often in a short time, so I determined to\r\nforego these same pleasures, handed over all papers to Klüber, gave\r\nEngel my keys, explained that I should take up my lodgings in the\r\nStenbock house in a week, and rode to the Moscow station. That was\r\nyesterday, twelve noon, and today early, at eight, I alighted here at\r\nthe Hôtel de France. * * * It lies in the nature of this people to\r\nharness slowly and drive fast. I ordered my carriage two hours ago,\r\nand to all inquiries which I have been making about every ten minutes\r\nduring the last hour and a half they say (Russian), \"_Ssitschàss_,\"\r\n(\"immediately\"), with unshaken and amiable calm, but there the matter\r\nends. You know my exemplary patience in waiting, but everything has\r\nits limits; hunting comes later, and horses and carriages are broken\r\nin the bad roads, so that one finally takes to walking. While writing\r\nI have drunk three glasses of tea and made way with a number of eggs;\r\nthe attempts at heating up have also been so entirely successful that\r\nI feel the need of getting some fresh air. I should shave myself for\r\nvery impatience if I had a mirror, in default of which, however, I\r\nshall send a greeting to my dear Tata, with yesterday's stubble beard.\r\nIt is very virtuous really that my first thought is always of you\r\nwhenever I have a moment free, and you should make an example of that\r\nfact. Very rambling is this city, and especially foreign-looking, with\r\nits churches and green roofs and countless cupolas, quite different\r\nfrom Amsterdam, but the two are the most original cities that I know.\r\nNot a single German conductor has any idea of the luggage that can be\r\nslipped into one of these coupés; not a Russian without two real,\r\ncovered head-cushions, children in baskets, and masses of provisions\r\nof every sort, although they eat five big meals at the stations on the\r\nway, breakfast at two, dinner five, tea seven, supper ten; it's only\r\nfour, to be sure, but enough for the short time. I was complimented by\r\nan invitation into a sleeping-coupé, where I was worse off than in my\r\neasy-chair; it is a wonder to me that so much fuss is made over one\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\r\nMoscow, June 8th.\r\n\r\nThis city is really, for a city, the most beautiful and original that\r\nthere is; the environs are pleasant, not pretty, not unsightly; but\r\nthe view from above out of the Kremlin, over this circle of houses\r\nwith green roofs, gardens, churches, towers of the most extraordinary\r\nshape and color, most of them green or red or light blue, generally\r\ncrowned on top by a colossal golden bulb, usually five or more on\r\none church, and surely one thousand towers! Anything more strangely\r\nbeautiful than all this, lighted by slanting sunset rays, cannot be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CORONATION OF KING WILLIAM I AT KÖNIGSBERG. From the\r\nPainting by Adolph von Menzel.]\r\n\r\nThe weather is clear again, and I should stay here some days longer if\r\nrumors of a big battle in Italy were not going about, which may result\r\nin lots of diplomatic work, so that I must get back to my post. The\r\nhouse in which I am writing is wonderful enough, really; one of the\r\nfew that have outlived 1812--old, thick walls, as in Schönhausen,\r\nOriental architecture, Moorish, large rooms, almost entirely occupied\r\nby the chancery officers, who administer, or maladminister, Jussupow's\r\nestates. He, his wife, and I have the one livable wing in the midst of\r\nthem. Lots of love.\r\n\r\nYour most faithful v.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nPetersburg, July 2, '59.\r\n\r\n_My Dear Heart_,--I received your letter of the 25th yesterday, and\r\nyou will probably get tomorrow the one that I sent to Stettin on\r\nWednesday with the Dowager Czarina. My homesick heart follows its\r\ncourse with yearning thoughts; it was such charming clear weather and\r\nfresh winds when we escorted her Highness on board in Peterhof that I\r\nshould have liked to leap on the ship, in uniform and without baggage,\r\nand go along with her. Since then the heat has grown worse, about the\r\ntemperature of a freely watered palm-house, and my lack of summer\r\nmaterials is making itself decidedly felt. I go about in the rooms in\r\nmy shirt alone, as the dear blue dressing-gown is too narrow, even now\r\nat six o'clock in the morning. A courier wakened me half an hour ago,\r\nwith his war and peace, and I cannot sleep any more now, although I\r\ndid not get to bed until towards two. Our politics are drifting more\r\nand more into the Austrian wake, and as soon as we have fired a shot\r\non the Rhine then it's all over with the war between Italy and\r\nAustria, and, instead of that, a war between France and Prussia will\r\ntake the stage, in which Austria, after we have taken the burden from\r\nher shoulders, will stand by us or will not stand by us, just as her\r\nown interests dictate. She will certainly not suffer us to play a\r\ngloriously victorious rôle. It is quite remarkable that in such crises\r\nCatholic ministers always hold the reins of our destiny--Radowitz once\r\nbefore, now Hohenzollern, who just now has the predominant influence,\r\nand is in favor of war. I look very darkly into the future; our troops\r\nare not better than the Austrian, because they only serve half as\r\nlong; and the German troops, on whose support we reckon, are for the\r\nmost part quite wretched, and, if things go ill with us, their leaders\r\nwill fall away from us like dry leaves in the wind. But God, who can\r\nhold up and throw down Prussia, and the world, knows why these things\r\nmust be, and we will not embitter ourselves against the land in which\r\nwe were born, and against the authorities for whose enlightenment we\r\npray. After thirty years, perhaps much sooner, it will be a small\r\nmatter to us how things stand with Prussia and Austria, if only the\r\nmercy of God and the deserving of Christ remain to our souls. I opened\r\nthe Scriptures last evening, at random, so as to rid my anxious heart\r\nof politics, and my eye lighted immediately on the 5th verse of the\r\n110th Psalm. As God wills--it is all, to be sure, only a question of\r\ntime, nations and people, folly and wisdom, war and peace; they come\r\nand go like waves of water, and the sea remains. What are our states\r\nand their power and honor before God, except as ant-hills and\r\nbee-hives which the hoof of an ox tramples down, or fate, in the form\r\nof a honey-farmer, overtakes? * * * Farewell, my sweetheart, and learn\r\nto experience life's folly in sadness; there is nothing in this world\r\nbut hypocrisy and jugglery, and whether fever or grape-shot shall bear\r\naway this mass of flesh, fall it must, sooner or later, and then such\r\na resemblance will appear between a Prussian and an Austrian, if they\r\nare of the same size, like Schrech and Rechberg, for example, that it\r\nwill be difficult to distinguish between them; the stupid and the\r\nclever, too, properly reduced to the skeleton state, look a good deal\r\nlike each other. Patriotism for a particular country is destroyed by\r\nthis reflection, but we should have to despair in any case, even now,\r\nwere it linked with our salvation. Farewell once more, with love to\r\nparents and children. How impatient I am to see them! As soon as\r\n_Vriendschap_--so our vessel is called--is in sight, I shall\r\ntelegraph. With love, as always,\r\n\r\nYour most faithful VON B.\r\n\r\n\r\nParis, May 31, '62.\r\n\r\n_My Dear Heart_,--Only a few lines in the press of business to tell\r\nyou I am well, but very lonely, with a view out over the green, in\r\nthis dull, rainy weather, while the bumble-bees hum and the sparrows\r\ntwitter. Grand audience tomorrow. It's vexatious that I have to buy\r\nlinen, towels, table-cloths, and sheets. * * * Farewell. Hearty love,\r\nand write! Your most faithful v.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nParis, June 1, '62.\r\n\r\n_My Dear Heart_,--The Emperor received me today, and I handed over my\r\ncredentials; he received me kindly, is looking well, has grown\r\nsomewhat stouter, but by no means fat and aged, as he generally is in\r\ncaricatures. The Empress is still one of the most beautiful women I\r\nknow, in spite of Petersburg; she has, if anything, grown more\r\nbeautiful in the past five years. The whole affair was official,\r\nceremonial; I was taken back in court-carriage with master of\r\nceremonies, etc. Next time I shall probably have a private audience. I\r\nlong for business, for I don't know what to do with myself. Today I\r\ndined alone, the young gentlemen were out; the entire evening rain;\r\nand at home alone. To whom should I go? In the midst of big Paris I am\r\nlonelier than you are at Reinfeld, and sit here like a rat in a\r\ndeserted house. The only pleasure I have had was sending the cook away\r\nbecause of overcharges. You know my indulgence in this matter, but\r\nRembours was a child in comparison. I am dining for the present in a\r\ncafé. How long that will last, God knows. I shall probably receive a\r\nsummons, by telegram, to Berlin, in eight or ten days, and then\r\ngood-by to this song-and-dance. If my opponents only knew what a boon\r\ntheir victory would be to me, and how heartily I desire it! Then\r\nRechberg would, perhaps, out of malice, do his best to have me called\r\nto Berlin. You can't have any more aversion to Wilhelmstrasse than\r\nmyself, and if I am not persuaded that it must be, then I will not go.\r\nI consider it cowardice and disloyalty to leave the King in the lurch,\r\nunder pretence of illness. If it is not to be, then God will permit\r\nthose who search to find another _princillon_ who will offer himself\r\nas cover for the pot. If it is to be, then \"_s'Bogom\"_ (\"with God\"),\r\nas our Russian drivers used to say, when they took up the reins. * * *\r\n\r\nYour v.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nBordeaux, July 27, '62.\r\n\r\n_My Dear Heart_,--You cannot refuse to testify that I am a good\r\ncorrespondent; I wrote this morning from Chenonceaux to your\r\nbirthday-child, and now this evening, from the city of red wine, to\r\nyou. But these lines will arrive a day later than those, as the mail\r\ndoes not leave until tomorrow afternoon. I left Paris only day before\r\nyesterday noon, but it seems to me a week. I have seen very beautiful\r\ncastles--Chambord, of which the enclosure (torn out of a book) gives\r\nonly an imperfect idea, corresponds, in its desolation, to the fate of\r\nits owner (I hope you know it belongs to the Duke of Bordeaux). In the\r\nwide halls and magnificent rooms, where so many kings kept their\r\ncourt, with their mistresses and their hunting, the Duke's only\r\nfurniture consists now of the children's toys. My guide took me for a\r\nFrench Legitimist, and squeezed out a tear as she showed me the little\r\ncannon. I paid for the tear-drop, tariff-wise, with an extra franc,\r\nalthough it is not my vocation to subsidize Carlism. The castle\r\ncourt-yards lay in the sun as quiet as deserted churches; there is a\r\ndistant view round about from the towers, but on all sides silent\r\nwoods and heather to the farthest horizon; not a city, not a village,\r\nnot a farm-house, either near the castle or in the region round it.\r\nThe enclosed sprigs, specimens of heather, will no longer show you how\r\npurple this plant I love so much blooms here, the only flower in the\r\nroyal garden, and swallows the only living creatures in the castle; it\r\nis too solitary for sparrows. The situation of the old castle of\r\nAmboise is glorious; from the top you can look up and down the Loire\r\nfor about thirty miles. Coming from there to this place one passes\r\ngradually into the south; wheat disappears, giving way to maize;\r\nbetween, twining vines and chestnut woods, castles and country-seats,\r\nwith many towers, chimneys, and gables, all white, with high-pointed\r\nslate roofs. It was boiling hot, and I was very glad to have a\r\nhalf-coupé to myself. In the evening glorious lightning in the whole\r\neastern sky, and now an agreeable coolness, which I should find sultry\r\nat home. The sun set at 7.35; in Petersburg one can see now, without a\r\nlight, at eleven o'clock. As yet there is no letter for me here;\r\nperhaps I shall find one in Bayonne. I shall stay here probably two\r\ndays, to see where our wines grow. Now, good-night, my angel. Dearest\r\nlove. Your most faithful v.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nSan Sebastian, August 1, '62.\r\n\r\n_My Dear Heart_,--I could not have believed last year that I should\r\ncelebrate Bill's birthday this time in Spain. I shall not fail to\r\ndrink his health in dark red wine, and pray God earnestly to take and\r\nkeep all of you under His protection; it is now half past three, and I\r\nimagine you have just got up from table and are sitting in the front\r\nhall at your coffee, if the sun permits. The sun is probably not so\r\nscalding there as it is here, but it doesn't do me any harm, and I am\r\nfeeling splendidly well. The route from Bayonne here is glorious; on\r\nthe left the Pyrenees, something like the Dent du Midi and Moléson,\r\nwhich, however, are here called \"Pie\" and \"Port,\" in shifting\r\nAlpine panorama, on the right the shores of the sea, like those at\r\nGenoa. The change in entering Spain is surprising; at Behobie, the\r\nlast place in France, one could easily believe one's self still on the\r\nLoire; in Fuentarabia a steep street twelve feet wide, every window\r\nwith balcony and curtain, every balcony with black eyes and mantillas,\r\nbeauty and dirt; at the market-place drums and fifes, and some\r\nhundreds of women, old and young, dancing a fandango, while the men in\r\ntheir drapery looked on, smoking. Thus far the country is\r\nexceptionally beautiful--green valleys and wooded slopes, with\r\nfantastic lines of fortifications above them, row after row; inlets of\r\nthe sea, with very narrow entrances, which cut deep into the land,\r\nlike Salzburg lakes in mountain basins. I look down on such a one from\r\nmy window, separated from the sea by an island of rocks, set in a\r\nsteep frame of mountains with woods and houses, below to the left city\r\nand harbor. My old friend Galen, who is taking the baths here, with\r\nwife and son, received me most warmly; I bathed with him at ten, and\r\nafter breakfast we walked, or, rather, crawled, through the heat up to\r\nthe citadel, and sat for a long time on a bench there, the sea a\r\nhundred feet below us, near us a heavy fortress-battery, with a\r\nsinging sentry. This hill or rock would be an island did not a low\r\ntongue of land connect it with the mainland. This tongue of land\r\nseparates two inlets from each other, so you get towards the north a\r\ndistant view of the sea from the citadel, towards the east and west a\r\nview of both inlets, like two Swiss lakes, and towards the south of\r\nthe tongue of land, with the town on it, and behind it, landward,\r\nmountains as high as the heavens. I wish I could paint you a picture\r\nof it, and if we both were fifteen years younger then we would take a\r\ntrip here together. Tomorrow, or day after, I go back to Bayonne. * * * I\r\nam very much sunburned, and should have liked best to float on the\r\nocean for an hour today; the water bears me up like a piece of wood.\r\nIt is still just cool enough to be pleasant. By the time one gets to\r\nthe dressing-room one is almost dry, and I put on my hat, only, and\r\ntake a walk in my peignoir. The ladies bathe fifty paces away--custom\r\nof the country. * * * I do not like the Spaniards so well as I like\r\ntheir country; they are not polite, talk too loud, and the conditions\r\nare in many ways behind those in Russia. Custom-houses and passport\r\nannoyances without end, an incredible number of turnpike tolls, four\r\nfrancs for one hour's drive, or else I should stay here still longer,\r\ninstead of bathing in Biarritz, where a bathing-suit is necessary.\r\nLove to our dear parents and children. Farewell, my angel.\r\n\r\nYour v.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nBiarritz, August 4, '62.\r\n\r\n* * * I am sitting in a corner room of the Hôtel de l'Europe, with a\r\ncharming lookout over the blue sea, which drives its white foam\r\nbetween wonderful cliffs and against the light-house. I have a bad\r\nconscience, seeing so many beautiful things without you. If one could\r\nonly bring you hither through the air, I would go right back again to\r\nSan Sebastian. Imagine the Siebengebirge with the Drachenfels placed\r\nby the sea; next to it Ehrenbreitstein, and between the two an arm of\r\nthe sea, somewhat wider than the Rhine, forcing its way into the land,\r\nand forming a round bay behind the mountains. In this you bathe in\r\nwater transparently clear, and so heavy and salty that you can lie\r\neasily right on top of it and can look through the wide gate of rocks\r\nto the sea, or landward, where the mountain chains tower up one after\r\nanother ever higher and ever bluer. The women of the middle and lower\r\nclasses are strikingly pretty, sometimes beautiful; the men surly and\r\nimpolite, and the comforts of life to which we are accustomed in\r\ncivilized lands are entirely lacking. In this respect I find Russia\r\npleasanter to travel in than Spain. What actually drove me out of the\r\ncountry was the swinishness in certain indispensable arrangements, and\r\nthen the cheating in the hotels, and the tolls. The heat there is no\r\nworse than here, and doesn't bother me; on the contrary, I am very\r\nwell, thank Heaven. Day before yesterday there was a storm whose like\r\nI have never seen. I had to make three attempts before I succeeded in\r\nclimbing the flight of four steps at the head of the pier. Pieces of\r\nstone and of trees flew through the air; so I unfortunately gave up my\r\nplace in a sailing-vessel for Bayonne, as I didn't believe it possible\r\nthat all would be quiet and cheerful again in four hours' time; so I\r\nmissed a charming sail along the coast, stayed one day longer in San\r\nSebastian, and left yesterday by the diligence, rather uncomfortably\r\npacked in between attractive little Spanish women, to whom I could not\r\nspeak a single word. Still, they understood Italian enough for me to\r\nmake clear to them my satisfaction with their exterior. Gr. Gallen and\r\nwife were very kind to me. As I was looking for a fan, they presented\r\nme with theirs for you; it is simple, but painted in style\r\ncharacteristic of the country. You would like the wife very much; he,\r\ntoo, is a good fellow, but she amounts to more intellectually. I got\r\nBernhard's long-expected letter today. He looks very black over\r\npolitics, is expecting another child, and is building barns and\r\nstables. I long for news from you and the children. * * * Dearest love\r\nto all.\r\n\r\nYour most faithful v.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nBiarritz, August 10, '62.\r\n\r\n_My Beloved Heart,-- * * * I am living about as at Stolpemünde, only\r\nwithout champagne; I drank some with Orloff today, for the first time\r\nsince I left Paris. In the afternoon I wander about among the cliffs,\r\nheaths, and fields, see orchards with aloe, figs, almonds, and borders\r\nof tamarinds, then I do some target-shooting, take my bath, sit on the\r\nrocks smoking, gazing at the sea, and thinking of you all. Politics I\r\nhave entirely forgotten; don't read any papers. The 15th has some\r\nclaims upon me; for propriety's sake I ought to go to Paris, too,\r\nsince I am in France, so as to congratulate the Emperor, hear his\r\nspeech, and attend the dinner. But I shall hardly bring myself to the\r\npoint of traveling over five hundred miles and interrupting the\r\nair-and-water cure, which is doing me so much good that I actually\r\nhate the thought of the dusty, close air of the royal residence. The\r\nEmperor is too reasonable a gentleman to take my absence amiss, and\r\nfrom Berlin I have an honest leave of absence. * * * Farewell, my\r\nangel, with dearest love.\r\n\r\nYour most faithful v.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nHohenmauth, Monday, September 7, '66.\r\n\r\nDo you remember, sweetheart, how we passed through here nineteen years\r\nago, on the way from Prague to Vienna? No mirror showed the future\r\nthen, nor in 1852, when I went over this railway with good Lynar. How\r\nstrangely romantic are God's ways! We are doing well, in spite of\r\nNapoleon; if we are not unmeasured in our claims and do not imagine we\r\nhave conquered the world, we shall achieve a peace that is worth the\r\ntrouble. But we are as easily intoxicated as disheartened, and it is\r\nmy thankless part to pour water into the foaming wine, and to insist\r\nthat we do not live alone in Europe, but with three other powers which\r\nhate and envy us. The Austrians hold position in Moravia, and we are\r\nbold enough to announce our headquarters for tomorrow at the point\r\nwhere they are now. Prisoners still keep passing in, and cannon, one\r\nhundred and eighty from the 3d to today. If they bring up their\r\nsouthern army, we shall, with God's gracious help, defeat it too;\r\nconfidence is universal. Our people are ready to embrace one another,\r\nevery man so deadly in earnest, calm, obedient, orderly, with empty\r\nstomach, soaked clothes, wet camp, little sleep, shoe-soles dropping\r\noff, kindly to all, no sacking or burning, paying what they can and\r\neating mouldy bread. There must surely be a solid basis of fear of God\r\nin the common soldier of our army, or all this could not be. News of\r\nour friends is hard to get; we lie miles apart from one another, none\r\nknowing where the other is, and nobody to send--that is, men might be\r\nhad, but no horses. For four days I have had search made for\r\nPhilip,[19] who was slightly wounded by a lance-thrust in the head, as\r\nGerhard[20] wrote me, but I can't find out where he is, and we have now\r\ncome thirty-seven miles farther. The King exposed himself greatly on\r\nthe 3d and it was well I was present, for all the warnings of others\r\nhad no effect, and no one would have dared to talk so sharply to him\r\nas I allowed myself to do on the last occasion, which gave support to\r\nmy words, when a knot of ten cuirassiers and fifteen horses of the\r\nSixth Cuirassier Regiment rushed confusedly by us, all in blood, and\r\nthe shells whizzed around most disagreeably close to the King. He\r\ncannot yet forgive me for having blocked for him the pleasure of being\r\nhit. \"At the spot where I was forced by order of the supreme authority\r\nto run away,\" were his words only yesterday, pointing his finger\r\nangrily at me. But I like it better so than if he were excessively\r\ncautious. He was full of enthusiasm over his troops, and justly so\r\nrapt that he seemed to take no notice of the din and fighting close to\r\nhim, calm and composed as at the Kreuzberg, and constantly meeting\r\nbattalions that he must thank with \"Good-evening, grenadiers,\" till we\r\nwere actually by this trifling brought under fire again. But he has\r\nhad to hear so much of this that he will stop it for the future, and\r\nyou may feel quite easy; indeed, I hardly believe there will be\r\nanother real battle.\r\n\r\nWhen you have of anybody _no_ word whatever, you may assume with\r\nconfidence that he is alive and well; for if acquaintances are wounded\r\nit is always known at latest in twenty-four hours. We have not come\r\nacross Herwarth and Steinmetz at all, nor has the King. Schreck, too,\r\nI have not seen, but I know they are well. Gerhard keeps quietly at\r\nthe head of his squadron, with his arm in a sling. Farewell--I must to\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nYour faithfullest v.B.\r\n\r\n\r\n Zwittau, Moravia, July 11, '66.\r\n\r\n_Dear Heart_,--I have no inkstand, all of them being in use; but for\r\nthe rest I get on well, after a good sleep on camp bed with air\r\nmattress; roused at eight by a letter from you. I went to bed at\r\neleven. At Königgrätz I rode the big sandy thirteen hours in the\r\nsaddle without feeding him He bore it very well, did not shy at shots\r\nnor at corpses, cropped standing grain and plum-leaves with zest at\r\nthe most trying moments, and kept up an easy gait to the last, when I\r\nwas more tired than the horse. My first bivouac for the night was on\r\nthe street pavement of Horic, with no straw, but helped by a carriage\r\ncushion. It was full of wounded; the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg found\r\nme and shared his chamber with me, Reuss, and two adjutants, and the\r\nrain made this very welcome to me. About the King and the shells I\r\nhave written you already. All the generals had a superstition that\r\nthey, as soldiers, must not speak to the King of danger, and always\r\nsent me off to him, though I am a major, too. They did not venture to\r\nspeak to his reckless Majesty in the serious tone which at last was\r\neffectual. Now at last he is grateful to me for it, and his sharp\r\nwords, \"How you drove me off the first time,\" etc., are an\r\nacknowledgment that I was right. Nobody knew the region, the King had\r\nno guide, but rode right on at random, till I obtruded myself to show\r\nthe way. * * * Farewell, my heart. I must go to the King.\r\n\r\nYour most faithful v.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nVendresse, September 3, 1870.\r\n\r\nTo MRS. VON BISMARCK:\r\n\r\n_My Dear Heart_,--Day before yesterday I left my quarters here before\r\ndawn, but came back today, and have meanwhile been through the great\r\nbattle of Sedan on the 1st, in which we took some thirty thousand\r\nprisoners, and shut the remainder of the French army, which we had\r\nchased ever since Bar-le-Duc, into the fortress, where they had to\r\nsurrender, with the Emperor, as prisoners of war. At five yesterday\r\nmorning, after I had discussed the terms of capitulation with Moltke\r\nand the French generals till one o'clock, General Reille, whom I know,\r\ncalled me up to say that Napoleon wished to speak with me. Without\r\nwashing or breakfast, I rode towards Sedan, found the Emperor in an\r\nopen carriage with three adjutants, and three more at hand in the\r\nsaddle, on the main road before Sedan. I dismounted, saluted him as\r\npolitely as in the Tuileries, and asked his commands. He desired to\r\nsee the King. I told him, as was true, that his Majesty's quarters\r\nwere fourteen miles away, at the place where I am writing now. Upon\r\nhis question, whither he should betake himself, I offered him, since I\r\nwas unfamiliar with the region, my quarters in Donchery, a village on\r\nthe Maas close to Sedan; he accepted them, and drove, escorted by his\r\nsix Frenchmen, by me; and by Carl, who meanwhile had ridden after me,\r\nthrough the lovely morning, towards our lines. He was distressed\r\nbefore reaching the place because of the possible crowds, and asked me\r\nif he might not stop at a lonely workman's house on the road. I had it\r\nexamined by Carl, who reported that it was wretched and dirty.\r\n\"_N'importe,_\" said Napoleon, and I mounted with him a narrow, rickety\r\nstairway. In a room ten feet square, with a fig-wood table and two\r\nrush-bottomed chairs, we sat an hour, the others staying below. A\r\nmighty contrast to our last interview, in '67, at the Tuileries. Our\r\nconversation was difficult, if I would avoid touching on things which\r\nmust be painful to those whom God's mighty hand had overthrown.\r\nThrough Carl, I had officers brought from the city, and Moltke\r\nrequested to come. We then sent out one of the first to reconnoitre,\r\nand discovered, a couple of miles off, at Fresnoi's, a little château\r\nwith a park. Thither I conducted him, with an escort of the Cuirassier\r\nbody-guards, which was meanwhile brought up, and there we concluded\r\nthe capitulation with Wimpfen, the French general-in-chief. By its\r\nterms, from forty to sixty thousand French--I do not yet know the\r\nnumber more exactly--became our prisoners, with everything they\r\nhave. The two receding days cost France one hundred thousand men and\r\nan emperor. He started early this morning, with all his court, horses,\r\nand wagons, for Wilhelmshöhe, at Cassel.\r\n\r\nIt is an event in universal history, a triumph for which we will thank\r\nGod the Lord in humility, and which is decisive of the war, even\r\nthough we must continue to prosecute it against headless France.\r\n\r\nI must close. With heartfelt joy I have learned today, from your\r\nletter and Marie's, of Herbert's reaching you. I met Bill yesterday,\r\nas I telegraphed you, and took him to my arms from his horse before\r\nthe King's face, while he stood with his limbs rigid. He is entirely\r\nwell and in high spirits. Hans and Fritz Carl and both the Billows I\r\nsaw with the Second Dragoon guards, well and cheerful.\r\n\r\nFarewell, my heart. Kiss the children.\r\n\r\nYour v.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nGastein, August 30, '71.\r\n\r\nHappy the man to whom God has given a virtuous wife, who writes him\r\nevery day. I am delighted that you are well, and that you have come to\r\nbe three, to whom I hope to add myself as fourth on the 7th or\r\n8th. * * * You see I have enough mental leisure here to devote myself to\r\nthe unaccustomed work of making plans; but all on the presupposition\r\nthat the excited Gauls do not worry my little friend Thiers to death, for\r\nthen I should have to stay with his Majesty and watch which way the\r\nhare runs. I do not think that likely, but with such a stupid nation\r\nas they are anything is possible. Hearty love to both fat children.\r\n\r\nYour most faithful v.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: From _The Love Letters of Bismarck_.

FORD\r\n\r\n\r\nBISMARCK TO KING WILLIAM\r\n\r\n\r\nBerlin, December 8, '63.\r\n\r\nYOUR MAJESTY:--\r\n\r\nI have the honor most respectfully to submit a Police report, the\r\nprinted compilation of the documents relating to the London treaty as\r\ncommanded, and the telegrams received up to the present. In my most\r\nhumble opinion it seems expedient to maintain our attitude toward\r\nIrminger[22] also outwardly in conformity with that of Austria. It is\r\nawkward that Sydow is charged with the report of the committee in the\r\nBundestag, for we shall thus always have to make our declaration\r\nfirst, and before Austria; if your Majesty does not command otherwise\r\nI will leave him without instructions on this point, and await\r\ntomorrow's committee issues, as the next measure, the letter to\r\nCopenhagen, will not be thereby delayed.\r\n\r\nThe final sentence of the Vienna telegram, that Christian IX. rules also\r\nin Copenhagen only by virtue of the London treaty, is not quite right;\r\nhe rules there because the legitimate heir, Prince Friedrich of Hesse,\r\nhas resigned in his favor. This legal title, which is in itself\r\nsufficient, has only been _confirmed_ by the London treaty, and then\r\nextended to the Duchies.\r\n\r\nv. BISMARCK.\r\n\r\nMarginal note by the King:\r\n\r\nPrince Friedrich resigned merely in order that the London treaty in\r\nfavor of Christian IX. might be effectuated.\r\n\r\nW.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKING WILLIAM I. TO BISMARCK\r\n\r\nBerlin, February 12, '67.\r\n\r\nWhen looking back to the decisive turning point reached by the\r\ndestinies of Prussia through the glorious fights of the past year, the\r\nmost distant generations will never forget that the elevation of the\r\nFatherland to new power, and to imperishable honors, that the opening\r\nup of an epoch of a rich and, with God's help, a blessing-bringing\r\ndevelopment are essentially due to your penetration, your energy, and\r\nthe skilful manner in which you conducted the affairs entrusted to\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nI have decided to show a renewed appreciation of these your most\r\ndistinguished merits, by the bestowal of a gift of four hundred\r\nthousand Thalers.[23] The Minister for Finance has been directed to\r\nplace this sum at your disposal.\r\n\r\nIt would be in accordance with my wishes if you devoted this gift, the\r\nbestowal of which is to manifest my and the Fatherland's thanks, to\r\nthe purchase of landed property, and entailed the same, so that with\r\nthe glory of your name it also may remain permanently in your family.\r\n\r\nYour grateful and faithfully devoted King,\r\n\r\nWILHELM.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBISMARCK TO KING WILLIAM I.\r\n\r\nDonchery, September 2, '70.\r\n\r\nAfter I came here yesterday evening, by your Royal Majesty's command, to\r\ntake part in the negotiations on the capitulation, these were\r\ninterrupted until 1 o'clock in the night, by time for consideration,\r\nwhich General Wimpffen solicited, being granted, after General von\r\nMoltke had definitely stated that no other terms will be granted than\r\nthe laying down of arms, and that the bombardment would recommence at 9\r\no'clock in the morning if the capitulation were not concluded by that\r\ntime. At about 6 o'clock this morning General Reille was announced, who\r\ninformed me that the Emperor wished to see me, and was already on his\r\nway here from Sedan. The General returned at once to report to his\r\nMajesty that I was following, and shortly afterwards I met the Emperor\r\nnear Fresnois, about half way between this place and Sedan. His Majesty\r\nwas driving in an open carriage with three officers of high rank, and\r\nwas escorted by three others on horseback. Of these officers I knew\r\npersonally Generals Castelnau, Reille, Moskowa, who seemed to be wounded\r\nin the foot, and Vaubert. As soon as I reached the carriage I\r\ndismounted, walked to the Emperor's side at the carriage door, and asked\r\nfor his Majesty's orders. The Emperor at first expressed the wish to see\r\nyour Imperial Majesty, evidently in the belief that your Majesty was\r\nalso at Donchery. When I replied that at present your Majesty's\r\nheadquarters were at Vendresse, thirteen miles away, the Emperor\r\nenquired whether your Majesty had decided where he should go, and what\r\nmy opinion on the subject was. I replied that, as it was quite dark when\r\nI arrived here, I knew nothing of the district, and offered to place at\r\nhis disposal at once the house in which I was staying at Donchery. The\r\nEmperor accepted this offer, and drove off at a walking pace in the\r\ndirection of Donchery; about a hundred yards from the Maas bridge, which\r\nleads into the town, he stopped in front of a lonely, workman's cottage,\r\nand asked me if he could not stay there. I had the house examined by\r\nCouncillor of Legation Count Bismarck-Bohlen, who in the meantime had\r\nfollowed me; when it was reported that the interior arrangements were\r\nvery poor and inadequate, but that there were no wounded men in the\r\nhouse, the Emperor alighted and invited me to accompany him inside.\r\nHere, in a very small room containing a table and two chairs, I had\r\nabout an hour's conversation with the Emperor. His Majesty emphasized\r\nespecially the wish to obtain more favorable conditions of capitulation\r\nfor the army. I declined from the outset to treat this question with his\r\nMajesty, as this was a purely military question, to be settled between\r\nGeneral von Moltke and General von Wimpffen. On the other hand, I asked\r\nif his Majesty were inclined to peace negotiations. The Emperor replied\r\nthat, as a prisoner, he was not now in a position to do so, and to my\r\nfurther enquiry by whom, in his opinion, the executive power was at\r\npresent represented in France, his Majesty referred me to the Government\r\nin Paris. When this point, which was indistinct in the Emperor's letter\r\nto your Majesty yesterday, was cleared up, I recognized, and did not\r\nconceal the fact from the Emperor, that the situation today, as\r\nyesterday, was still a purely military one, and emphasized the necessity\r\narising from it for us to obtain by the capitulation of Sedan above all\r\nthings a material pledge for the security of the military results we had\r\nattained. I had already weighed from all sides with General von Moltke\r\nyesterday evening, the question whether it would be possible, without\r\ndetriment to the German interests, to offer to the military feelings of\r\nhonor of an army which had fought well more favorable terms than those\r\nalready laid down. After due and careful consideration we both came to\r\nthe conclusion that this could not be done. When, therefore, General von\r\nMoltke, who in the meantime had arrived from the town, went to your\r\nMajesty to submit the Emperor's wishes, he did not do so, as your\r\nMajesty is well aware, with the intention of advocating them.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor then went out into the open air, and invited me to sit\r\nbeside him just outside the door of the cottage. His Majesty asked\r\nwhether it would not be practicable to allow the French army to cross\r\ninto Belgium, to be disarmed and detained there. I had discussed also\r\nthis eventuality with General v. Moltke on the previous evening and\r\nadduced the motive already given for not entering into the question of\r\nthis course of procedure. With respect to the political situation, I\r\nmyself took no initiative, and the Emperor went no further than to\r\ndeplore the ill-fortune of the war, stating that he himself had not\r\nwished the war, but was driven into it by the pressure of public\r\nopinion in France. I did not regard it as my office to point out at\r\nthat moment that what the Emperor characterized as public opinion was\r\nonly the artificial product of certain ambitious coteries of the\r\nFrench press, with a very narrow political horizon. I merely replied\r\nthat nobody in Germany wished for the war, especially not your\r\nMajesty, and that no German Government would have considered the\r\nSpanish question of so much interest as to be worth a war. I continued\r\nthat your Majesty's attitude toward the Spanish succession question\r\nwas finally determined by the misgiving whether it was right, for\r\npersonal and dynastic considerations, to mar the endeavor of the\r\nSpanish nation to reestablish, by this selection of a King, their\r\ninternal organization on a permanent basis; that your Majesty, in view\r\nof the good relations existing for so many years between the Princes\r\nof the Hohenzollern House and the Emperor, had never entertained any\r\ndoubt but that the Hereditary Prince would succeed in arriving at a\r\nsatisfactory understanding with his Majesty the Emperor respecting the\r\nacceptance of the Spanish election, that, however, your Majesty had\r\nregarded this, not as a German or a Prussian, but as a Spanish affair.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, between 9 and 10 o'clock, enquiries in the town, and\r\nespecially reconnaissances on the part of the officers of the general\r\nstaff, had revealed the fact that the castle of Bellevue, near\r\nFresnois, was suited for the accommodation of the Emperor, and was not\r\nyet occupied by the wounded. I reported this to his Majesty by\r\ndesignating Fresnois as the place I should propose to your\r\nMajesty for the meeting, and therefore referred it to the Emperor\r\nwhether his Majesty would proceed there at once, as a longer stay in\r\nthe little workman's cottage would be uncomfortable, and the Emperor\r\nwould perhaps need some rest. His Majesty readily assented, and I\r\naccompanied the Emperor, who was preceded by an escort of honor from\r\nyour Majesty's Own Cuirassier Regiment, to the Castle of Bellevue,\r\nwhere in the meantime the rest of the Emperor's suite and his\r\ncarriages, whose coming had, it appears, been considered doubtful, had\r\narrived from Sedan. General Wimpffen had also arrived, and with him,\r\nin anticipation of the return of General von Moltke, the discussion of\r\nthe capitulation negotiations, which were broken off yesterday, was\r\nresumed by General v. Podbielski in the presence of Lieut. Col. von\r\nVerdy and the chief of General v. Wimpffen's staff, these two officers\r\nacting as secretaries. I took part only in the commencement of the\r\nsame by setting forth the political and judicial situation in\r\naccordance with the information furnished me by the Emperor himself,\r\nas it was thereupon reported to me by Major Count von Nostitz, by\r\ndirection of General von Moltke, that your Majesty wished to see the\r\nEmperor only after the capitulation of the army had been concluded--on\r\nthe receipt of which announcement the hope cherished by the opposite\r\nparty of securing other terms than those decided on was given up. I\r\nthen rode off in the direction of Chehery with the intention of\r\nreporting the situation to your Majesty, met General v. Moltke on the\r\nway, bringing the text of the capitulation approved by your Majesty,\r\nand this, when we arrived with it at Fresnois, was accepted and signed\r\nwithout opposition. The demeanor of General v. Wimpffen, as also that\r\nof the other French generals, during the previous night was very\r\ndignified, and this brave officer could not forbear expressing to me\r\nhow deeply he was pained that he should have been called upon,\r\nforty-eight hours after his arrival from Africa, and half a day after\r\nhe had assumed command, to set his name to a capitulation so fatal to\r\nthe French arms, that, however, lack of provisions and ammunition, and\r\nthe absolute impossibility of any further defence imposed upon him, as\r\na general the duty of suppressing his personal feelings, as further\r\nbloodshed could in no way alter the situation. The permission for the\r\nofficers to be released on parole was received with great\r\nthankfulness, as an expression of your Majesty's intention not to hurt\r\nthe feelings of an army, which had fought bravely, beyond the point\r\ndemanded by the necessity of our political interests. General v.\r\nWimpffen also subsequently gave expression to this feeling in a letter\r\nin which he thanks General v. Moltke for the consideration he showed\r\nin conducting the negotiations.\r\n\r\nv. BISMARCK.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEMPEROR WILLIAM I. TO BISMARCK\r\n\r\nBerlin, March 21, '71.\r\n\r\nWith today's opening of the first German Reichstag after the\r\nreëstablishment of a German Empire, the first public activity of the\r\nsame begins. Prussia's history and destiny have for a long time\r\npointed to an event which is now accomplished by its being summoned to\r\nthe head of the newly founded Empire. Prussia owes this less to her\r\nextent of territory and her power, though both have equally increased,\r\nthan to her intellectual development and the organization of her army.\r\nThe brilliant position now occupied by my country has been attained\r\nthrough an unexpectedly rapid sequence of great events during the past\r\nsix years. The work to which I called you ten years ago falls within\r\nthis time. How you have justified the confidence with which I then\r\nsummoned you lies open to the world. It is to your counsel, your\r\ncircumspection, your unwearying activity that Prussia and Germany owe\r\nthe world-historical occurrence which is embodied in my capital today.\r\n\r\nAlthough the reward for such deeds is felt within you, I am\r\nnevertheless urged and bound to express to you publicly and\r\npermanently the thanks of the Fatherland and mine. I elevate you,\r\ntherefore, to the rank of a Prussian Prince (Fürst), which is to be\r\ninherited always by the eldest male member of your family.\r\n\r\nMay you see in this distinction the undying gratitude of Your Emperor\r\nand King\r\n\r\nWILHELM.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEMPEROR WILLIAM I. TO BISMARCK\r\n\r\nCoblenz, July 26, '72.\r\n\r\nYou will celebrate, on the 28th, a delightful family festival[24]\r\nwhich the Almighty in His mercy has accorded you. I, therefore, may\r\nand can not remain behind with my sympathy on this occasion, so will\r\nyou, and the Princess, your wife, accept my most cordial and warmest\r\ncongratulations on this great occasion. That both of you always gave\r\nthe first place, among the blessings showered on you by Providence, to\r\ndomestic happiness is something for which your prayers of thanksgiving\r\nshould ascend to heaven. Our and my prayers of thanksgiving, however,\r\ngo further, as they include thanks to God for having placed you at my\r\nside at a decisive moment, and thus opened up a career for my\r\nGovernment far exceeding thought and comprehension. You also will send\r\nup your feelings of thankfulness that God graciously permitted you to\r\naccomplish such great things. Both in and after all your labors you\r\nalways found comfort and peace in your home, and that gives you\r\nstrength in your difficult vocation. To preserve and strengthen you\r\nfor this is my constant solicitude, and I am glad to learn from your\r\nletter through Count Lehndorff and also from the latter himself that\r\nyou will now think more of yourself than of the documents.\r\n\r\nIn remembrance of your silver wedding a vase will be handed you which\r\nrepresents a grateful Borussia and which, fragile though the material\r\nof which it is composed may be, shall one day express even in every\r\nfragment what Prussia owes to you in its elevation to the height on\r\nwhich it now stands.\r\n\r\nYour truly devoted grateful King\r\n\r\nWILHELM.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBISMARCK TO EMPEROR WILLIAM I.\r\n\r\nVarzin, August I, '72.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty greatly gladdened my wife and me by graciously evincing\r\nsympathy in our family festival, and will, we trust, be graciously\r\npleased to accept our respectful thanks.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty justly emphasizes happiness in the home as being among\r\nthe chief blessings for which I have to thank God, but part of the\r\nhappiness in my house, for my wife as well as for myself, comes from\r\nthe consciousness of your Majesty's satisfaction, and the exceedingly\r\ngracious and kindly words of appreciation which your Majesty's letter\r\ncontains are more beneficial to afflicted nerves than is all medical\r\nassistance. In looking back over my life I have such inexhaustible\r\ncause to thank God for His unmerited mercy, that I often fear\r\neverything will not go so well with me until the end. I recognize it\r\nas an especially happy dispensation that God has called me on earth to\r\nthe service of a master whom I serve joyfully and with love, as the\r\ninnate fidelity of the subject never has to fear, under your Majesty's\r\nleadership, coming into conflict with a warm feeling for the honor and\r\nthe welfare of the Fatherland. May God further give me strength to\r\ncarry out the will so to serve your Majesty that I obtain the\r\nsovereign satisfaction, of which such a gracious testimony lies before\r\nme today in the form of the autograph letter of the 26th. The vase,\r\nwhich arrived in good time, is a truly monumental expression of Royal\r\nfavor, and at the same time so substantial that I may hope not the\r\n\"fragments\" but the whole will be evidence to my descendants of the\r\ngracious sympathy evinced by your majesty on the occasion of our\r\nsilver wedding.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the fifty-fourth regiment showed a kindly spirit of\r\ncomradeship by sending their band from Colberg. Otherwise, as is\r\nusually the case in the country, we were confined to our family\r\ncircle; only Motley, the former American Ambassador in London, a\r\nfriend of my early youth, happened to be here on a visit. Besides her\r\nMajesty the Queen, his Majesty the King of Bavaria, and their Royal\r\nHighnesses Prince Carl and Friedrich Carl, and his Imperial Highness\r\nthe Crown Prince, honored me with telegraphic congratulations.\r\n\r\nIn health I am becoming slowly better; I have, it is true, done no\r\nwork whatever; but I hope to be able to report myself on duty in time\r\nfor the Imperial visits.\r\n\r\nv. BISMARCK.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEMPEROR WILLIAM I. TO BISMARCK\r\n\r\nBerlin, December 18, '81.\r\n\r\nI must tell you of an extraordinary dream I had last night, which was\r\nas clear as I now relate it.\r\n\r\nThe Reichstag met for the first time after the present recess. On\r\nCount Eulenburg's entrance the discussion abruptly ceased; after a\r\nlong interval the President called on the last speaker to continue the\r\ndebate. Silence! The President thereupon declared the sitting\r\nadjourned. This was the signal for great tumult and clamor. No order,\r\nit was urged, should be bestowed on any member during the session of\r\nthe Reichstag; the Monarch may not be mentioned during the session.\r\nThe House adjourns till tomorrow. Eulenburg's appearance in the\r\nChamber is again greeted with hisses and commotion--and then I awoke\r\nin such a state of nervous excitement that it was long before I\r\nrecovered, and I could not sleep from half-past four to half-past\r\nsix. All this happened in the House in my presence, as clearly as I\r\nhave written it down.\r\n\r\nI will not hope that the dream will be realized, but it is certainly\r\npeculiar. I dreamt it after six hours of quiet sleep, so it could not\r\nhave been directly produced by our conversation.\r\n\r\n_Enfin_, I could not but tell you of this curious occurrence.\r\n\r\nYour\r\n\r\nWILHELM.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBISMARCK TO EMPEROR WILLIAM I.\r\n\r\nBerlin, December 18, '81.\r\n\r\nI thank your Majesty most respectfully for the gracious letter. I\r\nquite believe that the dream owed its origin, not exactly to my\r\nreport, but to the general impression obtained during the last few\r\ndays from Puttkamer's[25] oral report, the newspaper articles, and my\r\nreport. The pictures we have in our minds when awake do not reappear\r\nin the mirror of our dreams until our mental faculties have been well\r\nrested by sleep. Your Majesty's communication encourages me to relate\r\na dream I had in the troublous days of the spring of 1863. I dreamt,\r\nand I told my dream at once to my wife and to others the next morning,\r\nthat I was riding along a narrow Alpine path, to the right an abyss,\r\nand to the left rocks; the path became narrower and narrower, until at\r\nlast my horse refused to take another step, and there was no room\r\neither to turn or to dismount. I then struck the smooth rocky wall\r\nwith my riding whip in my left hand, and invoked God; the whip became\r\ninterminably long, and the wall of rock collapsed like a scene in the\r\ntheatre, opening up a wide pathway, with a view over hills and forests\r\nsuch as one sees in Bohemia. I also caught sight of Prussian troops,\r\nwith their banners, and, still in my dreams, wondered how I could best\r\nreport this Quickly to your Majesty. This dream was realized, and I\r\nawoke from it glad and strengthened.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRANZ VON LENBACH EMPEROR WILLIAM I]\r\n\r\nThe bad dream from which your Majesty awoke nervous and agitated can\r\nbe realized only in so far that we shall still have many stormy and\r\nnoisy parliamentary debates, which must unfortunately undermine the\r\nprestige of the Parliaments and seriously interfere with State\r\nbusiness. Your Majesty's presence at these debates is an\r\nimpossibility; and I regard such scenes as we have lately witnessed in\r\nthe Reichstag regrettable enough as a standard of our morals and our\r\npolitical education, perhaps also our political qualifications, but\r\nnot as a misfortune in themselves: _l'excès du mal en devient le\r\nremède_.\r\n\r\nWill your Majesty pardon, with your accustomed graciousness, these\r\nholiday reflections, which were suggested by your Majesty's letter;\r\nfor from yesterday till January 9th we have holidays and rest.\r\nBISMARCK.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEMPEROR WILLIAM I. TO BISMARCK\r\n\r\nBerlin, September 23, '87.\r\n\r\nYou celebrate on September 23, my dear Prince, the day on which,\r\ntwenty-five years ago, I called you into my Ministry of State, and\r\nshortly afterwards gave the Premiership into your hands. The\r\ndistinguished services you had previously rendered to the Fatherland\r\nin the most varied and important positions justified me in conferring\r\non you this highest post. The history of the last quarter of a century\r\nproves that I did not err in my choice!\r\n\r\nA shining example of true patriotism, of untiring activity often to\r\nthe utter disregard of your health, you have been indefatigable in\r\nkeeping a close watch on what were frequently overwhelming\r\ndifficulties in peace and war, and have used them to lead Prussia in\r\nhonor and glory to a Position in the world's history which had never\r\nbeen dreamed of! Such achievements have been performed that the\r\ntwenty-fifth anniversary of September 23 must be celebrated with\r\nthanks to God for placing you at my side in order to execute His will\r\non earth!\r\n\r\nAnd I now once more impress these thanks on you, as I have so\r\nfrequently expressed and manifested them hitherto!\r\n\r\nFrom a heart filled with thankfulness I congratulate you on the\r\ncelebration of such a day, and hope from my heart that your strength\r\nmay long be preserved unimpaired, to be a blessing to the Crown and to\r\nthe Fatherland! Your eternally grateful King and friend\r\n\r\nWILHELM.\r\n\r\nP.S.--In memory of the past twenty-five years I am sending you a view\r\nof the building in which we have discussed and taken such weighty\r\nresolutions which it is to be hoped will redound to the honor and\r\nwelfare of Prussia and of Germany.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBISMARCK. TO EMPEROR WILLIAM I.\r\n\r\nFriedrichsruh, September 26, '87.\r\n\r\nI thank your Majesty in deep respect for the gracious letter of the\r\n23d inst., and for the gracious present of the picture of the palace\r\nin which for so many years I have had the honor to make my reports to\r\nyour Majesty, and to take your Majesty's orders. The day received\r\nespecial consecration for me through the greeting in your Majesty's\r\nname with which their royal Highnesses Prince William and Prince Henry\r\nhonored me. Even without this fresh proof of favor, the feeling with\r\nwhich I greeted the twenty-fifth anniversary of my appointment as a\r\nMinister was one of most cordial and respectful gratitude to your\r\nMajesty. Every sovereign appoints ministers, but it is a rare\r\noccurrence in modern times for a monarch to retain a Prime Minister\r\nand to uphold him for twenty-five years, in troublous times when\r\neverything does not succeed, against all animosity and intrigues.\r\nDuring this period I have seen many a former friend become an\r\nopponent, but your Majesty's favor and confidence have remained\r\nunwaveringly with me. The thought of this is a rich reward to me for\r\nall my work, and a consolation in illness and solitude. I love my\r\nFatherland, the German as well as the Prussian, but I should not have\r\nserved it with gladness if it had not been granted to me to serve to\r\nthe satisfaction of my King. The high position which I owe to your\r\nMajesty's favor is based on, and has as its indestructible core, your\r\nMajesty's Brandenburg liegeman and Prussian officer, and therefore I\r\nam rendered happy by your Majesty's satisfaction, without which every\r\npopularity would be valueless to me. * * * Besides many telegrams and\r\naddresses from home and abroad, I received very gracious greetings and\r\ncongratulations on the twenty-third from their Majesties of Saxony and\r\nWurtemburg, from his Royal Highness the Regent of Bavaria, the\r\nGrand-Dukes of Weimar, Baden, and Mecklenburg, and other rulers, and\r\nfrom his Majesty the King of Italy and Minister Crispi. The two latter\r\ntouched politics, and were difficult to answer; as the text of their\r\nletters may perhaps interest your Majesty, I have instructed the\r\nForeign Office to forward them.\r\n\r\nI pray God that He may still longer grant me the pleasure of serving\r\nyour Majesty to your Majesty's satisfaction.\r\n\r\nVOL.

BUTLER\r\n\r\nLate Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTO THE FIRST UNITED DIET\r\n\r\nLeft school at Easter, 1832, a normal product of our state system of\r\neducation; a Pantheist, and, if not a Republican, at least with the\r\npersuasion that the Republic was the most rational form of government;\r\nreflecting too upon the causes which could decide millions of men\r\npermanently to obey _one man_, when all the while I was hearing from\r\ngrown up people much bitter or contemptuous criticism of their rulers.\r\nMoreover, I had brought away with me \"German-National\" impressions\r\nfrom Plamann's preparatory school, conducted on Jahn's drill-system,\r\nin which I lived from my sixth to my twelfth year. These impressions\r\nremained in the stage of theoretical reflections, and were not strong\r\nenough to extirpate my innate Prussian monarchical sentiments. My\r\nhistorical sympathies remained on the side of authority. To my\r\nchildish ideas of justice Harmodius and Aristogeiton, as well as\r\nBrutus, were criminals, and Tell a rebel and murderer. Every German\r\nprince who resisted the Emperor before the Thirty Years' war roused my\r\nire; but from the Great Elector onwards I was partisan enough to take\r\nan anti-imperial view, and to find it natural that things should have\r\nbeen in readiness for the Seven Years' war. Yet the German-National\r\nfeeling remained so strong in me that, at the beginning of my\r\nuniversity life, I at once entered into relations with the\r\n_Burschenschaft_, or group of students which made the promotion of a\r\nnational sentiment its aim. But, after personal intimacy with its\r\nmembers, I disliked their refusal to \"give satisfaction,\" as well as\r\ntheir want of breeding in externals and of acquaintance with the forms\r\nand manners of good society; and a still closer acquaintance bred an\r\naversion to the extravagance of their political views, based upon a\r\nlack of either culture or knowledge of the conditions of life which\r\nhistorical causes had brought into existence, and which I, with my\r\nseventeen years, had had more opportunities of observing than most of\r\nthese students, for the most part older than myself. Their ideas gave\r\nme the impression of an association between Utopian theories and\r\ndefective breeding. Nevertheless, I retained my own private National\r\nsentiments, and my belief that in the near future events would lead to\r\nGerman unity; in fact, I made a bet with my American friend Coffin\r\nthat this aim would be attained in twenty years.\r\n\r\nIn my first half-year at Göttingen occurred the Hambach festival[27]\r\n(May 27, 1832), the \"festal ode\" of which still remains in my memory; in\r\nmy third the Frankfort outbreak[28](April 3, 1833). These manifestations\r\nrevolted me. Mob interference with political authority conflicted with\r\nmy Prussian schooling, and I returned to Berlin with less liberal\r\nopinions than when I quitted it; but this reaction was again somewhat\r\nmitigated when I was brought into immediate connection with the workings\r\nof the political machine. Upon foreign politics, with which the public\r\nat that time occupied itself but little, my views, as regards the War of\r\nLiberation, were taken from the standpoint of a Prussian officer. On\r\nlooking at the map, the Possession of Strasburg by France exasperated\r\nme, and a visit to Heidelberg, Spires, and the Palatinate made me feel\r\nrevengeful and militant. In the period before 1848 succeed in laying a\r\ncoat of European varnish over the specifically Prussian bureaucrat. How\r\nthese observations acted in practice is clearly shown when we go through\r\nthe list of our diplomatists of those days: one is astonished to find so\r\nfew native Prussians among them. The fact of being the son of a foreign\r\nambassador accredited to Berlin was of itself ground for preference. The\r\ndiplomatists who had grown up in small courts and had been taken into\r\nthe Prussian service had not infrequently the advantage over natives of\r\ngreater assurance in Court circles and a greater absence of shyness. An\r\nespecial example of this tendency was Herr von Schleinitz. In the list\r\nwe find also members of noble houses in whom descent supplied the place\r\nof talent. I scarcely remember from the period when I was appointed to\r\nFrankfort anyone of Prussian descent being appointed chief of an\r\nimportant mission, except myself, Baron Carl von Werther, Canitz, and\r\nCount Max Hatzfeldt (who had a French wife). Foreign names were at a\r\npremium: Brassier, Perponcher, Savigny, Oriola. It was presumed that\r\nthey had greater fluency in French, and they were more out of the\r\ncommon. Another feature was the disinclination to accept personal\r\nresponsibility when not covered by unmistakable instructions, just as\r\nwas the case in the military service in 1806 in the old school of the\r\nFrederickian period. Even in those days we were breeding stuff for\r\nofficers, even as high as the rank of regimental commander, to a pitch\r\nof perfection attained by no other state; but beyond that rank the\r\nnative Prussian blood was no longer fertile in talents, as in the time\r\nof Frederick the Great. Our most successful commanders, Blücher,\r\nGneisenau, Moltke, Goeben, were not original Prussian products, any more\r\nthan Stein, Hardenberg, Motz, and Grolmann in the Civil Service. It is\r\nas though our statesmen, like the trees in nurseries, needed\r\ntransplanting in order that their roots might find full development.\r\n\r\nAncillon advised me first of all to pass my examination as\r\n_Regierungs-Assessor,_ and then, by the circuitous route of\r\nemployment in the Zollverein to seek admittance into the _German_\r\ndiplomacy of Prussia; he did not, it would seem, anticipate in a scion\r\nof the native squirearchy a vocation for European diplomacy. I took\r\nhis hint to heart, and resolved first of all to go up for my\r\nexamination as _Regierungs-Assessor_.\r\n\r\nThe persons and institutions of our judicial system with which I was\r\nin the first instance concerned gave my youthful conceptions more\r\nmaterial for criticism than for respect. The practical education of\r\nthe _Auscultator_ began with keeping the minutes of the Criminal\r\nCourts, and to this post I was promoted out of my proper turn by the\r\n_Rath_, Herr von Brauchitsch, under whom I worked, because in those\r\ndays I wrote a more than usually quick and legible hand. On the\r\nexaminations, as criminal proceedings in the inquisitorial method of\r\nthat day were called, the one that has made the most lasting\r\nimpression upon me related to a widely ramifying association in Berlin\r\nfor the purpose of unnatural vice. The club arrangements of the\r\naccomplices, the agenda books, the levelling effect through all\r\nclasses of a common pursuit of the forbidden--all this, even in 1835,\r\npointed to a demoralization in no whit less than that evidenced by the\r\nproceedings against the Heinzes, husband and wife, in October, 1891.\r\nThe ramifications of this society extended even into the highest\r\ncircles. It was ascribed to the influence of Prince Wittgenstein that\r\nthe reports of the case were demanded from the Ministry of Justice,\r\nand were never returned--at least, during the time I served on the\r\ntribunal.\r\n\r\nAfter I had been keeping the records for four months, I was\r\ntransferred to the City Court, before which civil causes are tried,\r\nand was suddenly promoted from the mechanical occupation of writing\r\nfrom dictation to an independent post, which, having regard to my\r\ninexperience and my sentiments, made my position difficult. The\r\nfirst stage in which the legal novice was called to a more independent\r\nsphere of activity was in connection with divorce proceedings.\r\nObviously regarded as the least important, they were entrusted to\r\nthe most incapable _Rath_, Prätorius by name, and under him were\r\nleft to the tender mercies of unfledged _Auscultators_, who had to\r\nmake upon this _corpus vile_ their first experiments in the\r\npart of judges--of course, under the nominal responsibility of Herr\r\nPrätorius, who nevertheless took no part in their proceedings. By way\r\nof indicating this gentleman's character, it was told to us young\r\npeople that when, in the course of a sitting, he was roused from a\r\nlight slumber to give his vote, he used to say, \"I vote with my colleague\r\nTempelhof\"--whereupon it was sometimes necessary to point out to him\r\nthat Herr Tempelhof was not present.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion I represented to him my embarrassment at having,\r\nthough only a few months more than twenty years old, to undertake the\r\nattempt at a reconciliation between an agitated couple: a matter\r\ncrowned, according to my view, with a certain ecclesiastical and moral\r\n\"nimbus,\" with which in my state of mind I did not feel able to cope.\r\nI found Prätorius in the irritable mood of an old man awakened at an\r\nuntimely moment, who had besides all the aversion of an old bureaucrat\r\nto a young man of birth. He said, with a contemptuous smile, \"It is\r\nvery annoying, Herr _Referendarius_, when a man can do nothing for\r\nhimself; I will show you how to do it.\" I returned with him into the\r\njudge's room. The case was one in which the husband wanted a divorce\r\nand the wife not. The husband accused her of adultery; the wife,\r\ntearful and declamatory, asserted her innocence; and, despite all\r\nmanner of ill-treatment from the man, wanted to remain with him.\r\nPrätorius, with his peculiar clicking lisp, thus addressed the woman:\r\n\"But, my good woman, don't be so stupid. What good will it do you?\r\nWhen you get home, your husband will give you a jacketing until you\r\ncan stand no more. Come now, simply say 'yes,' and then you will be\r\nquit of the sot.\" To which the wife, crying hysterically, replied: \"I\r\nam an honest woman! I will not have that indignity put upon me! I\r\ndon't want to be divorced!\" After manifold retorts and rejoinders in\r\nthis tone, Prätorius turned to me with the words: \"As she will not\r\nlisten to reason, write as follows, Herr _Referendarius_,\" and\r\ndictated to me some words which, owing to the deep impression they\r\nmade upon me, I remember to this day. \"Inasmuch as the attempt at\r\nreconciliation has been made, and arguments drawn from the sphere of\r\nreligion and morality have proved fruitless, further proceedings were\r\ntaken as follows.\" My chief then rose and said, \"Now, you see how it\r\nis done, and in future leave me in peace about such things.\" I\r\naccompanied him to the door, and went on with the case. The Divorce\r\nCourt stage of my career lasted, so far as I can remember, from four\r\nto six weeks; a reconciliation case never came before me again. There\r\nwas a certain necessity for the ordinance respecting proceedings in\r\ndivorce cases, to which Frederick William IV. was obliged to confine\r\nhimself after his attempts to introduce a _law_ for the substantial\r\nalteration of the Marriage Law had foundered upon the opposition of\r\nthe Council of State. With regard to this matter it may be mentioned\r\nthat, as a result of this ordinance, the Attorney-General was first\r\nintroduced into those provinces in which the old Prussian common law\r\nprevailed as _defensor matrimonii_, and to prevent collusion between\r\nthe parties.\r\n\r\nMore inviting was the subsequent stage of petty cases, where the\r\nuntrained young jurist at least acquired practice in listening to\r\npleadings and examining witnesses, but where more use was made of him\r\nas a drudge than was met by the resulting benefit to his instruction.\r\nThe locality and the procedure partook somewhat of the restless bustle\r\nof a railway manager's work. The space in which the leading _Rath_ and\r\nthe three or four _Auscultators_ sat with their backs to the public\r\nwas surrounded by a wooden screen, and round about the four-cornered\r\nrecess formed thereby surged an ever-changing and more or less noisy\r\nmob of parties to the suits.\r\n\r\nMy impression of institutions and persons was not essentially modified\r\nwhen I had been transferred to the Administration. In order to\r\nabbreviate the détour to diplomacy, I applied to a Rhenish government,\r\nthat of Aachen, where the course could be gone through in two years,\r\nwhereas in the \"old\" provinces at least three years were required.[29]\r\n\r\nI can well imagine that in making the appointments to the Rhenish\r\nGoverning Board in 1816 the same procedure was adopted as at the\r\norganization of Elsass-Lothringen in 1871. The authorities who had to\r\ncontribute a portion of their staff would not be likely to respond to\r\nthe call of state requirements by putting their best foot foremost to\r\naccomplish the difficult task of assimilating a newly acquired\r\npopulation, but would have chosen those members of their offices whose\r\ndeparture was desired by their superiors or wished by themselves; in\r\nthe board were to be found former secretaries of prefectures and other\r\nrelics of the French administration. The _personnel_ did not all\r\ncorrespond to the ideal which floated unwarrantably enough before my\r\neyes at twenty-one, and still less was this the case with the details\r\nof the current business. I recollect that, what with the many\r\ndifferences of opinion between officials and governed, or with\r\ninternal differences of opinion among each of these two categories,\r\nwhose polemics for many years considerably swelled the bulk of the\r\nrecords, my habitual impression was, \"Well, yes, that is _one_ way of\r\ndoing it\"; and that questions, the decision of which one way or the\r\nother was not worth the paper wasted upon them, created a mass of\r\nbusiness which a single prefect could have disposed of with the fourth\r\npart of the energy bestowed upon them. Nevertheless, except for the\r\nsubordinate officials, the day's work was slight; as regards heads of\r\ndepartments especially, a mere sinecure.\r\n\r\nI quitted Aachen with a very poor opinion of our bureaucracy, in\r\ndetail and collectively, with the exception of the gifted President,\r\nCount Arnim-Boitzenburg. My opinion of the detail became more\r\nfavorable owing to my next subsequent experience in the government at\r\nPotsdam, to which I got transferred in the year 1837; because there,\r\nunlike the arrangement in other provinces, the indirect taxes were at\r\nthe disposal of the government, and it was just these that were\r\nimportant to me if I wanted to make customs-policy the basis of my\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nThe members of the board made a better impression upon me than those\r\nat Aachen; but yet, taking them as a whole, it was an impression of\r\npigtail and periwig, in which category my youthful presumption also\r\nplaced the paternal dignified President-in-Chief, von Bassewitz; while\r\nthe President of the Aachen Government, Count Arnim, wore the generic\r\nwig of the state service, it is true, but no intellectual pigtail.\r\nWhen therefore I quitted the service of the State for a country life,\r\nI imported into the relations which as a landed proprietor I had with\r\nthe officials an opinion, which I now see to have been too mean, of\r\nthe value of our bureaucracy, and perhaps too great an inclination to\r\ncriticize them. I remember that as substitute provincial president I\r\nhad to give my verdict on a plan for abolishing the election of those\r\nofficials; I expressed myself to the effect that the bureaucracy, as\r\nit ascended from the provincial president, sank in the general esteem;\r\nit had preserved it only in the person of the provincial president,\r\nwho wore a Janus head, one face turned towards the bureaucracy, the\r\nother towards the country.\r\n\r\nThe tendency to interference in the most various relations of life\r\nwas, under the paternal government of those days, perhaps greater than\r\nnow; but the instruments of such interference were less numerous, and,\r\nas regards culture and breeding, stood much higher than do some of\r\nthose of today. The officials of the right worshipful royal Prussian\r\ngovernment were honest, well-read and well-bred officials; but their\r\nbenevolent activity did not always meet with recognition, because from\r\nwant of local experience they went to pieces on matters of detail, in\r\nregard to which the views of the learned citizen at the green table\r\nwere not always superior to the healthy common-sense criticism of the\r\npeasant intelligence. The members of the Governing Boards had in those\r\ndays _multa_, not _multum_, to do; and the lack of higher duties\r\nresulted in their not finding a sufficient quantity of important\r\nbusiness, and led them in their zeal for duty to go beyond the needs\r\nof the governed, into a tendency to over-regulation--in a word, into\r\nwhat the Swiss calls _Befehlerle_.[30] To glance at a comparison with\r\npresent conditions, it had been hoped that the state authorities would\r\nhave been relieved of business and of officials by the introduction of\r\nthe local self-government of today; but, on the contrary, the number\r\nof the officials and their load of business have been very\r\nconsiderably increased by correspondence, and friction with the\r\nmachinery of self-government, from the provincial councillor down to\r\nthe rural parish administration. Sooner or later the flaw must be\r\nreached, and we shall be crushed by the burden of clerkdom, especially\r\nin the subordinate bureaucracy.\r\n\r\nMoreover, bureaucratic pressure upon private life is intensified by the\r\nmode in which self-government works in practice and encroaches more\r\nsharply than before on the rural parishes. Formerly the provincial\r\npresident, who stood in as close relations with the people as with the\r\nState, formed the lowest step in the State bureaucracy. Below him were\r\nlocal authorities, who were no doubt subject to control, but not in the\r\nsame measure as nowadays to the disciplinary powers of the district, or\r\nthe ministerial, bureaucracy. The rural population enjoys today, by\r\nvirtue of the measure of self-government conceded to it, an autonomy,\r\nnot perhaps similar to that which the towns had long ago; but it has\r\nreceived, in the shape of the official commissioner, a chief who is kept\r\nin disciplinary check by superior instructions proceeding from the\r\nprovincial resident, under the threat of penalties, and compelled to\r\nburden his fellow-citizens in his district with lists, notifications,\r\nand inquisitions as the political hierarchy thinks good. The governed\r\n_contribuens plebs_ no longer possess, in the court of the provincial\r\npresident, that guarantee against blundering encroachment which, at an\r\nearlier period was to be found in the circumstance that people resident\r\nin the district who became provincial presidents as a rule resolved to\r\nremain so in their own districts all their life long, and sympathized\r\nwith the joys and sorrows of the district. Today the post of provincial\r\npresident is the lowest step in the ladder of the higher administration,\r\nsought after by young \"assessors\" who have a justifiable ambition to\r\nmake a career. To obtain it they have more need of ministerial favor\r\nthan of the goodwill of the local population, and they attempt to win\r\nthis favor by conspicuous zeal, and by \"taking it out of\" the official\r\ncommissioners of the so-called local administration, or by carrying out\r\nvalueless bureaucratic experiments. Therein lies for the most part the\r\ninducement to overburden their subordinates in the local self-government\r\nsystem. Thus self-government means the aggravation of bureaucracy,\r\nincrease in the number of officials, and of their powers and interference\r\nin private life.\r\n\r\nIt is only human nature to be more keenly sensitive to the thorns than\r\nto the roses of every institution, and that the thorns should irritate\r\none against the existing state of things. The old government\r\nofficials, when they came into direct contact with the governed\r\npopulation, showed themselves to be pedantic, and estranged from the\r\npractical working of life by their occupation at the green table; but\r\nthey left behind them the impression of toiling honesty and\r\nconscientiously for justice. The same thing cannot be assumed in all\r\ntheir degrees of the wheels in the machine of the self-government of\r\ntoday in those country districts where the parties stand in acute\r\nopposition to each other; goodwill towards political friends, frame\r\nof mind as regards opponents, readily become a hindrance to the\r\nimpartial maintenance of institutions. According to my experiences in\r\nearlier and more recent times, I should, for the rest, not like to\r\nallow impartiality, when comparing judicial and administrative\r\ndecisions, to the former alone, not at least in every instance. On the\r\ncontrary, I have preserved an impression that judges of small local\r\ncourts succumb more easily to strong party influences than do\r\nadministrative officials; nor need we invent any psychological reason\r\nfor the fact that, given equal culture, the latter should _a priori_\r\nbe considered less just and conscientious in their official decisions\r\nthan the former. But I certainly do assume that official decisions do\r\nnot gain in honesty and moderation by being arrived at collectively;\r\nfor apart from the fact that, in the case of voting by majority,\r\narithmetic and chance take the place of logical reasoning, that\r\nfeeling of personal responsibility, in which lies the essential\r\nguarantee for the conscientiousness of the decision, is lost directly\r\nit comes about by means of anonymous majorities.\r\n\r\nThe course of business in the two boards of Potsdam and Aachen was not\r\nvery encouraging for my ambition. I found the business assigned to\r\nme petty and tedious, and my labors in the department of suits\r\narising from the grist tax and from the compulsory contribution to\r\nthe building of the embankment at Rotzis, near Wusterhausen, have\r\nleft behind in me no sentimental regrets for my sphere of work in\r\nthose days. Renouncing the ambition for an official career, I\r\nreadily complied with the wishes of my parents by taking up the\r\nhumdrum management of our Pomeranian estates. I had made up my\r\nmind to live and die in the country, after attaining successes in\r\nagriculture--perhaps in war also, if war should come. So far as my\r\ncountry life left me any ambition at all, it was that of a lieutenant\r\nin the Landwehr.\r\n\r\nThe impressions that I had received in my childhood were little\r\nadapted to make a squire of me. In Plamann's educational\r\nestablishment, conducted on the systems of Pestalozzi and Jahn, the\r\n\"von\" before my name was a disadvantage, so far as my childish comfort\r\nwas concerned, in my intercourse with my fellow-pupils and my\r\nteachers. Even at the high school at the Grey Friars I had to suffer,\r\nas regards individual teachers, from that hatred of nobility which had\r\nclung to the greater part of the educated _bourgeoisie_ as a\r\nreminiscence of the days before 1806. But even the aggressive tendency\r\nwhich occasionally appeared in _bourgeois_ circles never gave me any\r\ninducement to advance in the opposite direction. My father was free\r\nfrom aristocratic prejudices, and his inward sense of equality had\r\nbeen modified, if at all, by his youthful impressions as an officer,\r\nbut in no way by any over-estimate of inherited rank. My mother was\r\nthe daughter of Mencken, Privy Councillor to Frederick the Great,\r\nFrederick William II., and Frederick William III., who sprang from a\r\nfamily of Leipzig professors, and was accounted in those days a\r\nLiberal. The later generations of the Menckens--those immediately\r\npreceding me--had found their way to Prussia in the Foreign Office and\r\nabout the Court. Baron von Stein has quoted my grandfather Mencken as\r\nan honest, strongly Liberal official. Under these circumstances, the\r\nviews which I imbibed with my mother's milk were Liberal rather than\r\nreactionary; and, if my mother had lived to see my ministerial\r\nactivity, she would scarcely have been in accord with its direction,\r\neven though she would have experienced great joy in the external\r\nresults of my official career. She had grown up in bureaucratic and\r\ncourt circles; Frederick William IV. spoke of her as \"Mienchen,\" in\r\nmemory of childish games. I can therefore declare it an unjust\r\nestimate of my views in my younger years, when \"the prejudices of my\r\nrank\" are thrown in my teeth and it is maintained that a recollection\r\nof the privileges of the nobility has been the starting-point of my\r\ndomestic policy.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the unlimited authority of the old Prussian monarchy was\r\nnot, and is not, the final word of my convictions. As to that, to be\r\nsure, this authority of the monarch constitutionally existed in the\r\nfirst United Diet, but accompanied by the wish and anticipation that\r\nthe unlimited power of the King, without being overturned, might fix\r\nthe measure of its own limitation. Absolutism primarily demands\r\nimpartiality, honesty, devotion to duty, energy, and inward humility\r\nin the ruler. These may be present, and yet male and female favorites\r\n(in the best case the lawful wife), the monarch's own vanity and\r\nsusceptibility to flattery, will nevertheless diminish the fruits of\r\nhis good intentions, inasmuch as the monarch is not omniscient and\r\ncannot have an equal understanding of all branches of his office. As\r\nearly as 1847 I was in favor of an effort to secure the possibility of\r\npublic criticism of the government in parliament and in the press, in\r\norder to shelter the monarch from the danger of having blinkers put on\r\nhim by women, courtiers, sycophants, and visionaries, hindering him\r\nfrom taking a broad view of his duties as monarch, or from avoiding\r\nand correcting his mistakes. This conviction of mine became all the\r\nmore deeply impressed upon me in proportion as I became better\r\nacquainted with Court circles, and had to defend the interest of the\r\nState from their influences and also from the opposition of a\r\ndepartmental patriotism. The interests of the State alone have guided\r\nme, and it has been a calumny when publicists, even well-meaning, have\r\naccused me of having ever advocated an aristocratic system. I have\r\nnever regarded birth as a substitute for want of ability; whenever I\r\nhave come forward on behalf of landed property, it has not been in the\r\ninterests of proprietors of my own class, but because I see in the\r\ndecline of agriculture one of the greatest dangers to our permanence\r\nas a State. The ideal that has always floated before me has been a\r\nmonarchy which should be so far controlled by an independent national\r\nrepresentation--according to my notion, representing classes or\r\ncallings--that monarch or parliament would not be able to alter\r\nthe existing statutory position before the law _separately_ but only\r\n_communi consensus_ with publicity, and public criticism, by press and\r\nDiet, of all political proceedings.\r\n\r\nWhoever has the conviction that uncontrolled Absolutism, as it was\r\nfirst brought upon the stage by Louis XIV., was the most fitting form\r\nof government for German subjects, must lose it after making a special\r\nstudy in the history of Courts, and such critical observations as I\r\nwas enabled to institute at the court of Frederick William IV. (whom\r\npersonally I loved and revered) in Manteuffel's days. The King was a\r\nreligious absolutist with a divine vocation, and the ministers after\r\nBrandenburg were content as a rule if they were covered by the royal\r\nsignature even when they could not have personally answered for the\r\ncontents of what was signed. I remember that on one occasion a high\r\nCourt official of absolutist opinions, on hearing of the news of the\r\nroyalist rising at Neuchâtel, observed, with some confusion, in the\r\npresence of myself and several of his colleagues: \"That is a royalism\r\nof which nowadays one has to go very far from Court to get\r\nexperience.\" Yet, as a rule, sarcasm was not a habit of this old\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\nObservations which I made in the country as to the venality and\r\nchicanery of the \"district sergeants\" and other subordinate officials,\r\nand petty conflicts which I had with the government in Stettin as\r\ndeputy of the \"Circle\" and deputy for the provincial president,\r\nincreased my aversion to the rule of the bureaucracy. I may mention\r\none of these conflicts. While I was representing the President, then\r\non leave, I received an order from the government to compel the patron\r\nof Külz, that was myself, to undertake certain burdens. I put the\r\norder aside, meaning to give it to the president on his return, was\r\nrepeatedly worried about it, and fined a thaler, to be forwarded\r\nthrough the post. I now drew up a statement, in which I figured as\r\nhaving appeared, first of all as representative of the _Landrath_,\r\nand secondly as patron of Külz. The party cited made the prescribed\r\nrepresentations to himself in his capacity as No. 1, and then\r\nproceeded in his capacity of No. 2 to set forth the ground on which he\r\nhad to decline the application; after which the statement was approved\r\nand subscribed by him in his double capacity. The government\r\nunderstood a joke, and ordered the fine to be refunded. In other\r\ncases, things resulted in less pleasant heckling. I had a critical\r\ndisposition, and was consequently liberal, in the sense in which the\r\nword was then used among landed proprietors to imply discontent with\r\nthe bureaucracy, the majority of whom on their side were men more\r\nliberal than myself, though in another sense.\r\n\r\nI again slipped off the rails of my parliamentary liberal tendencies,\r\nwith regard to which I found little understanding or sympathy\r\nin Pomerania, but which in Schönhausen met with the acquiescence\r\nof men in my own district, like Count Wartensleben of Karow,\r\nSchierstädt-Dahlen, and others (the same men of whom some were among\r\nthe party of Church patrons in the New Era subsequently condemned).\r\nThis was the result of the style, to me unsympathetic, in which the\r\nopposition was conducted in the first United Diet, to which I was\r\nsummoned, only for the last six weeks of the session, as substitute\r\nfor Deputy von Brauchitsch, who was laid up with illness. The speeches\r\nof the East Prussians, Saucken-Tarputschen and Alfred Auerswald, the\r\nsentimentality of Beckerath, the Gallo-Rhenish liberalism of Heydt and\r\nMevissen, and the boisterous violence of Vincke's speeches, disgusted\r\nme; and even at this date when I read the proceedings they give me the\r\nimpression of imported phrases made to pattern. I felt that the King\r\nwas on the right track, and could claim to be allowed time, and not be\r\nhurried in his development.\r\n\r\nI came into conflict with the Opposition the first time I made a\r\nlonger speech than usual, on May 17, 1847, when I combatted the legend\r\nthat the Prussians had gone to war in 1813 to get a constitution, and\r\ngave free expression to my natural indignation at the idea that\r\nforeign domination was in itself no adequate reason for fighting.[31]\r\nIt appeared to me undignified that the nation, as a set-off to its\r\nhaving freed itself, should hand in to the King an account payable in\r\nthe paragraphs of a constitution. My performance produced a storm. I\r\nremained in the tribune turning over the leaves of a newspaper which\r\nlay there, and then, when the commotion had subsided, I finished my\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\nAt the Court festivities, which took place during the session of the\r\nUnited Diet, I was avoided in a marked manner both by the King and the\r\nPrincess of Prussia, though for different reasons: by the latter\r\nbecause I was neither Liberal nor popular; by the former for a reason\r\nwhich only became clear to me later. When, on the reception of the\r\ndeputies, he avoided speaking to me--when, in the Court circle, after\r\nspeaking to every one in turn, he broke off immediately he came to me,\r\nturned his back, or strolled away across the room--I considered myself\r\njustified in supposing that my attitude as a Royalist Hotspur had\r\nexceeded the limits which the King had fixed for himself. Only some\r\nmonths later, when I reached Venice on my honeymoon, did I discover\r\nthat this explanation was incorrect. The King, who had recognized me\r\nin the theatre, commanded me on the following day to an audience and\r\nto dinner; and so unexpected was this to me that my light travelling\r\nluggage and the incapacity of the local tailor did not admit of my\r\nappearing in correct costume. My reception was so kindly, and the\r\nconversation, even on political subjects, of such a nature as to\r\nenable me to infer that my attitude in the Diet met with his\r\nencouraging approval. The King commanded me to call upon him in the\r\ncourse of the winter, and I did so. Both on this occasion at smaller\r\ndinners at the palace I became persuaded that I stood high in the\r\nfavor of both the King and the Queen, and that the former, in avoiding\r\nspeaking to me in public, at the time of the session of the Diet, did\r\nnot mean to criticize my political conduct, but at the time did not want\r\nto let others see his approval of me.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nVISIT TO PARIS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1855 Count Hatzfeldt, our ambassador in Paris,\r\ninvited me to visit the Industrial Exhibition;[32] he still shared the\r\nbelief then existent in diplomatic circles that I was very soon to be\r\nManteuffel's successor at the Foreign Office. Although the King had\r\nentertained such an idea on and off, it was already then known in the\r\ninnermost Court circles that a change had taken place. Count William\r\nRedern, whom I met in Paris, told me that the ambassadors continued to\r\nbelieve I was destined to be made a minister and that he himself had\r\nalso believed this; but that the King had changed his mind--of further\r\ndetails he was ignorant. Doubtless since Rügen.\r\n\r\nAugust 15, Napoleon's day, was celebrated among other ways by a\r\nprocession of Russian prisoners through the streets. On the 19th the\r\nQueen of England made her entry, and on August 25 a State ball was\r\ngiven in her honor at Versailles at which I was presented to her and\r\nto Prince Albert.\r\n\r\nThe Prince, handsome and cool in his black uniform, conversed with\r\nme courteously, but in his manner there was a kind of malevolent\r\ncuriosity from which I concluded that my anti-occidental influence\r\nupon the King was not unknown to him. In accordance with the mode\r\nof thought peculiar to him, he sought for the motives of my conduct not\r\nwhere they really lay, that is, in the anxiety to keep my country\r\nindependent of foreign influences--influences which found a fertile soil\r\nin our narrow-minded reverence for England and fear of France--and in\r\nthe desire to hold ourselves aloof from a war which we should not have\r\ncarried on in our own interests but in dependence upon Austrian and\r\nEnglish policy.\r\n\r\nIn the eyes of the Prince--though I of course did not gather this from\r\nthe momentary impression made during my presentation, but from\r\nulterior acquaintance with facts and documents--I was a reactionary\r\nparty man who took up sides for Russia in order to further an\r\nAbsolutist and \"Junker\" policy. It was not to be wondered at that this\r\nview of the Prince's and of the then partisans of the Duke of Coburg\r\nhad descended to the Prince's daughter, who shortly after became our\r\nCrown Princess.\r\n\r\nEven soon after her arrival in Germany, in February, 1858, I became\r\nconvinced, through members of the royal house and from my own\r\nobservations, that the Princess was prejudiced against me personally.\r\nThe fact itself did not surprise me so much as the form in which her\r\nprejudice against me had been expressed in the narrow family\r\ncircle--\"she did not trust me.\" I was prepared for antipathy on\r\naccount of my alleged anti-English feelings and by reason of my\r\nrefusal to obey English influences; but from a conversation which I\r\nhad with the Princess after the war of 1866 while sitting next to her\r\nat table I was obliged to conclude that she had subsequently allowed\r\nherself to be influenced in her judgment of my character by\r\nfurther-reaching calumnies. I was ambitious, she said, in a\r\nhalf-jesting tone, to be a king or at least president of a republic. I\r\nreplied in the same semi-jocular tone that I was personally spoilt for\r\na republican; that I had grown up in the royalist traditions of the\r\nfamily and had need of a monarchical institution for my earthly\r\nwell-being: I thanked God, however, I was not destined to live like a\r\nking, constantly on show, but to be until death the king's faithful\r\nsubject. I added that no guarantee could, however, be given that this\r\nconviction of mine would be universally inherited, and this not\r\nbecause royalists would give out, but because perhaps kings might.\r\n_Pour faire un civet, il faut un lièvre, et pour faire une monarchie\r\nil faut un roi_. I could not answer for it that for want of such the\r\nnext generation might not be republican. I further remarked that in\r\nthus expressing myself I was not free from anxiety at the idea of a\r\nchange in the occupancy of the throne without a transference of the\r\nmonarchical traditions to the successor. But the Princess avoided\r\nevery serious turn and kept up the jocular tone as amiable and\r\nentertaining as ever; she rather gave me the impression that she\r\nwished to tease a political opponent.\r\n\r\nDuring the first years of my ministry I frequently remarked in the\r\ncourse of similar conversation that the Princess took pleasure in\r\nprovoking my patriotic susceptibility by playful criticism of persons\r\nand matters.\r\n\r\nAt that ball at Versailles Queen Victoria spoke to me in German. She\r\ngave me the impression of beholding in me a noteworthy but\r\nunsympathetic personality, but still her tone of voice was without\r\nthat touch of ironical superiority that I thought I detected in Prince\r\nAlbert's. She continued to be amiable and courteous like one unwilling\r\nto treat an eccentric fellow in an unfriendly way.\r\n\r\nIn comparison with Berlin it seemed a curious arrangement to me that\r\nat supper the company ate in three classes, with gradations in the\r\nmenu, and that such guests as were to sup at all were assured of this\r\nby having a ticket bearing a number handed to them as they entered.\r\nThe tickets of the first class also bore the name of the lady\r\npresiding at the table to which they referred. These tables were\r\narranged to accommodate fifteen or twenty. On entering I received one\r\nof these tickets for Countess Walewska's table and later on in the\r\nball-room two more from two other lady patronesses of diplomacy and of\r\nthe Court. No exact plan for placing the guests had therefore been\r\nmade out. I chose the table of Countess Walewska, to whose department\r\nI belonged as a foreign diplomatist. On the way to the room in\r\nquestion I came across a Prussian officer in the uniform of an\r\ninfantry regiment of the guard, accompanied by a French lady; he was\r\nengaged in an animated dispute with one of the imperial household\r\nstewards who would not allow either of them to pass, not being\r\nprovided with tickets. After the officer, in answer to my inquiries,\r\nhad explained the matter and indicated the lady as a duchess bearing\r\nan Italian title of the First Empire, I told the court official that I\r\nhad the gentleman's ticket, and gave him one of mine. Now, however,\r\nthe official would not allow the lady to pass and I therefore gave the\r\nofficer my second ticket for his duchess. The official then said\r\nsignificantly to me: \"_Mais vous ne passerez pas sans carte_.\" On my\r\nshowing him the third, he made a face of astonishment and allowed all\r\nthree of us to pass. I recommended my two _protégés_ not to sit down\r\nat the tables indicated on the tickets, but to try and find seats\r\nelsewhere; nor did any complaints concerning my distribution of\r\ntickets ever come to my ears. The want of organization was so great\r\nthat our table was not fully occupied, a fact due to the absence of\r\nany understanding among the _dames patronesses_. Old Prince Pückler\r\nhad either received no ticket or had been unable to find his table;\r\nafter he had turned to me, whom he knew by sight, he was invited by\r\nCountess Walewska to take one of the seats that had remained empty.\r\nThe supper, in spite of the triple division, was neither materially\r\nnor as regards its preparation upon a level with what is done in\r\nBerlin at similar crowded festivities; the waiting only was efficient\r\nand prompt.\r\n\r\nWhat struck me most was the difference in the regulations for the free\r\ncirculation of the throng. In this respect the palace of Versailles\r\noffers much greater facilities than that of Berlin on account of the\r\nlarger number and, if we except the White Hall, the greater\r\nspaciousness of the apartments. Here those who had supped in class 1\r\nwere ordered to make their exit by the same way as the hungry ones of\r\nclass 2 entered, their impetuous charge betraying certainly less\r\nacquaintance with the customs of Court society. Personal collisions\r\noccurred among the belaced and beribboned gentlemen and superelegant\r\nladies, giving rise to scuffles and abusive language, such as would\r\nbe impossible in our palace. I retired with the satisfactory\r\nimpression that in spite of all the splendor of the imperial Court the\r\nCourt service, the breeding and manners of Court society were on a\r\nhigher level with us, as well as in St. Petersburg and Vienna, than in\r\nParis, and that the times were past when one could go to France and to\r\nthe Court of Paris to receive a schooling in courtesy and good\r\nmanners. Even the etiquette of small German Courts, antiquated as it\r\nwas, especially in comparison with St. Petersburg, was more dignified\r\nthan the practice of the imperial Court. It is true that I had already\r\nreceived this impression in Louis Philippe's time, during whose reign\r\nit became quite the fashion in France to distinguish oneself in the\r\ndirection of excessively free and easy manners, and of abstention from\r\ncourtesy, especially towards ladies. Although it had become better in\r\nthis respect during the Second Empire, the tone in official and Court\r\nsociety and the demeanor of the Court itself still remained below the\r\nstandard of the three great eastern Courts. Only in the Legitimist\r\ncircles aloof from the official world were things different both in\r\nthe time of Louis Philippe and in that of Louis Napoleon; there the\r\ntone was faultless, courteous, and hospitable, with occasional\r\nexceptions of the younger gentlemen spoilt by their contact with\r\nParis, who borrowed their habits not from the family but from the\r\nclub.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor, whom I saw for the first time during this visit to Paris,\r\ngave me to understand in several interviews, but at that time only in\r\ngeneral phrases, his desire and intentions respecting a\r\nFranco-Prussian alliance. His words were to the effect that these two\r\nneighboring States, which by reason of their culture and their\r\ninstitutions stood at the head of civilization, were naturally thrown\r\nupon each other's assistance. Any inclination to express before me\r\nsuch grievance as might arise from our refusal to join the Western\r\nPowers was kept out of the foreground. I had the feeling that the\r\npressure which England and Austria exercised in Berlin and Frankfort\r\nto compel us to render assistance in the western camp was much\r\nstronger, one might say more passionate and rude, than the desires and\r\npromises expressed to me in an amicable form, with which the Emperor\r\nsupported his plea for our understanding with France in particular. He\r\nwas much more indulgent than England and Austria respecting our sins\r\nagainst occidental policy. He never spoke German to me, either then or\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nThat my visit to Paris had caused displeasure at the court at home,\r\nand had intensified, especially in the case of Queen Elizabeth, the\r\nill-feelings already entertained towards me, I was able to perceive at\r\nthe end of September of the same year. While the King was proceeding\r\ndown the Rhine to Cologne to attend the cathedral building festival, I\r\nreported myself at Coblentz and was, with my wife, invited by his\r\nMajesty to perform the journey to Cologne on the steamer; my wife,\r\nhowever, was ignored by the Queen on board and at Remagen.[33] The\r\nPrince of Prussia, who had observed this, gave my wife his arm and led\r\nher to table. At the conclusion of the meal I begged for permission to\r\nreturn to Frankfort, which was granted me.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the following winter, during which the King had again\r\napproached me, that he asked me once at dinner, straight across the\r\ntable, my opinion concerning Louis Napoleon; his tone was ironical. I\r\nreplied: \"It is my impression that the Emperor Napoleon is a discreet\r\nand amiable man, but that he is not so clever as the world esteems\r\nhim. The world places to his account everything that happens, and if\r\nit rains in eastern Asia at an unseasonable moment chooses to\r\nattribute it to some malevolent machination of the Emperor. Here\r\nespecially we have become accustomed to regard him as a kind of _génie\r\ndu mal_ who is forever only meditating how to do mischief in the\r\nworld.[34] I believe he is happy when he is able to enjoy anything\r\ngood at his ease; his understanding is overrated at the expense of his\r\nheart; he is at bottom good-natured and has an unusual measure of\r\ngratitude for every service rendered him.\"\r\n\r\nThe King laughed at this in a manner that vexed me and led me to ask\r\nwhether I might be permitted to guess his Majesty's present thoughts.\r\nThe King consented, and I said: \"General von Canitz used to lecture to\r\nthe young officers in the military school on the campaigns of\r\nNapoleon. An assiduous listener asked him how Napoleon could have\r\nomitted to make this or that movement. Canitz replied: 'Well, you see\r\njust what this Napoleon was--a real goodhearted fellow, but so\r\nstupid!' which naturally excited great mirth among the military\r\nscholars. I fear that your Majesty is thinking of me much as General\r\nvon Canitz thought of his pupils.\"\r\n\r\nThe King laughed and said: \"You may be right; but I am not\r\nsufficiently acquainted with the present Napoleon to be able to impugn\r\nyour impression that his heart is better than his head.\" That the\r\nQueen was dissatisfied with my view I was enabled to gather from the\r\nexternal trifles by which impressions are made known at court.\r\n\r\nThe displeasure felt at my intercourse with Napoleon sprang from the\r\nidea of \"Legitimacy,\" or, more strictly speaking, from the word\r\nitself, which was stamped with its modern sense by Talleyrand, and\r\nused in 1814 and 1815 with great success and to the advantage of the\r\nBourbons as a deluding spell.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE EMS TELEGRAM\r\n\r\n\r\nOn July 2, 1870, the Spanish ministry decided in favor of the accession\r\nto that throne of Leopold, Hereditary Prince of Hohenzollern. This gave\r\nthe first stimulus in the field of international law to the subsequent\r\nmilitary question, but still only in the form of a specifically Spanish\r\nmatter. It was hard to find in the law of nations a pretext for France\r\nto interfere with the freedom of Spain to choose a King; after people in\r\nParis had made up their minds to war with Prussia, this was sought for\r\nartificially in the name Hohenzollern, which in itself had nothing more\r\nmenacing to France than any other German name. On the contrary, it might\r\nhave been assumed, in Spain as well as in Germany, that Prince\r\nHohenzollern, on account of his personal and family connections in\r\nParis, would be a _persona grata_ beyond many another German Prince. I\r\nremember that on the night after the battle of Sedan I was riding along\r\nthe road to Donchéry in thick darkness, with a number of our officers,\r\nfollowing the King in his journey round Sedan. In reply to a question\r\nfrom some one in the company I talked about the preliminaries to the\r\nwar, and mentioned at the same time that I had thought Prince Leopold\r\nwould be no unwelcome neighbor in Spain to the Emperor Napoleon, and\r\nwould travel to Madrid _via_ Paris, in order to get into touch with the\r\nimperial French policy, forming as it did a part of the conditions under\r\nwhich he would have had to govern Spain. I said: \"We should have been\r\nmuch more justified in dreading a close understanding between the\r\nSpanish and French crowns than in hoping for the restoration of a\r\nSpanish-German anti-French constellation after the analogy of Charles\r\nV.; a king of Spain can only carry out Spanish policy, and the Prince by\r\nassuming the crown of the country would become a Spaniard.\" To my\r\nsurprise there came from the darkness behind me a vigorous rejoinder\r\nfrom the Prince of Hohenzollern, of whose presence I had not the least\r\nidea; he protested strongly against the possibility of presuming any\r\nFrench sympathies in him. This protest in the midst of the battlefield\r\nof Sedan was natural for a German officer and a Hohenzollern Prince, and\r\nI could only answer that the Prince, as King of Spain, could have\r\nallowed himself to be guided by Spanish interests only, and prominent\r\namong these, in view of strengthening his new kingdom, would have been a\r\nsoothing treatment of his powerful neighbor on the Pyrenees. I made my\r\napology to the Prince for the expression I had uttered while unaware of\r\nhis presence.\r\n\r\nThis episode, introduced before its time, affords evidence as to the\r\nconception I had formed of the whole question. I regarded it as a\r\nSpanish and not as a German one, even though I was delighted at seeing\r\nthe German name of Hohenzollern active in representing monarchy in\r\nSpain, and did not fail to calculate all the possible consequences\r\nfrom the point of view of our interests--a duty which is incumbent on\r\na foreign minister when anything of similar importance occurs in\r\nanother State. My immediate thought was more of the economic than of\r\nthe political relations in which a Spanish King of German extraction\r\ncould be serviceable. For Spain I anticipated from the personal\r\ncharacter of the Prince, and from his family relations, tranquillizing\r\nand consolidating results, which I had no reason to grudge the\r\nSpaniards. Spain is among the few countries which, by their\r\ngeographical position and political necessities, have no reason to\r\npursue an anti-German policy; besides which, she is well adapted, by\r\nthe economic relations of supply and demand, for an extensive trade\r\nwith Germany. An element friendly to us in the Spanish government\r\nwould have been an advantage which in the course of German policy\r\nthere appeared no reason to reject _a limine_, unless the apprehension\r\nthat France might be dissatisfied was to be allowed to rank as one. If\r\nSpain had developed again more vigorously than hitherto has been the\r\ncase, the fact that Spanish diplomacy was friendly toward us might\r\nhave been useful to us in time of peace; but it did not seem to me\r\nprobable that the King of Spain, on the outbreak of the war between\r\nGermany and France, which was evidently coming sooner or later, would,\r\nwith the best will in the world, be in a position to prove his\r\nsympathy with Germany by an attack on France or a demonstration\r\nagainst her; and the conduct of Spain after the outbreak of the war\r\nwhich we had drawn upon us by the complaisance of German princes\r\nshowed the accuracy of my doubt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ADOLPH VON MENZEL KING WILLIAM'S DEPARTURE FOR THE\r\nFRONT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FRANCO-GERMAN WAR.]\r\n\r\nThe chivalrous Cid would have called France to account for\r\ninterference in Spain's free choice of a king, and not have left the\r\nvindication of Spanish independence to foreigners. The nation,\r\nformerly so powerful by land and sea, cannot at the present day hold\r\nthe cognate population of Cuba in check; and how could one expect her\r\nto attack a Power like France from affection towards us? No Spanish\r\ngovernment, and least of all an alien king, would possess power enough\r\nin the country to send even a regiment to the Pyrenees out of\r\naffection toward Germany. Politically I was tolerably indifferent to\r\nthe entire question. Prince Anthony was more inclined than myself to\r\ncarry it peacefully to the desired goal. The memoirs of his Majesty\r\nthe King of Roumania are not accurately informed as regards details of\r\nthe ministerial coöperation in the question. The ministerial council\r\nin the palace which he mentions did not take place. Prince Anthony was\r\nliving as the King's guest in the palace, and had invited him and some\r\nof the ministers to dinner. I scarcely think that the Spanish question\r\nwas discussed at table. If the Duke of Gramont[35] labors to adduce\r\nproof that I did not stand aloof from and averse to the Spanish\r\nproposal, I find no reason to contradict him. I can no longer recall\r\nthe text of my letter to Marshal Prim, which the Duke has heard\r\nmentioned; if I drew it up myself, about which I am equally uncertain,\r\nI should hardly have called the Hohenzollern candidature \"_une\r\nexcellente chose_\": the expression is not natural to me. That I\r\nregarded it as \"opportune,\" not \"_à un moment donné_,\" but in\r\nprinciple and in time of peace is correct. I had not the slightest\r\ndoubt in the matter that the grandson of the Murats, a favorite at\r\nthe French Court, would secure the goodwill of France towards his\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe intervention of France at its beginning concerned Spanish and not\r\nPrussian affairs; the garbling of the matter in the Napoleonic policy,\r\nby virtue of which the question was to become a Prussian one, was\r\ninternationally unjustifiable and exasperating, and proved to me that\r\nthe moment had arrived when France sought a quarrel against us and was\r\nready to seize any pretext that seemed available. I regarded the\r\nFrench intervention in the first instance as an injury, and\r\nconsequently as an insult to Spain, and expected that the Spanish\r\nsense of honor would resist this encroachment. Later on, when the turn\r\nof affairs showed that, by her encroachment on Spanish independence,\r\nFrance intended to threaten us with war, I waited for some days\r\nexpecting that the Spanish declaration of war against France would\r\nfollow that of the French against us. I was not prepared to see a\r\nself-assertive nation like Spain stand quiet behind the Pyrenees with\r\nordered arms, while the Germans were engaged in a deadly struggle\r\nagainst France on behalf of Spain's independence and freedom to choose\r\nher king. The Spanish sense of honor which proved so sensitive in the\r\nCarlist question simply left us in the lurch in 1870. Probably in both\r\ncases the sympathies and international ties of the Republican parties\r\nwere decisive.\r\n\r\nThe first demands of France respecting the candidature for the Spanish\r\nthrone, and they were unjustifiable, had been presented on July 4, and\r\nanswered by our Foreign Office evasively, though in accordance with\r\ntruth, that the _ministry_ knew nothing about the matter. This was\r\ncorrect so far, that the question of Prince Leopold's acceptance of\r\nhis election had been treated by his Majesty simply as a family\r\nmatter, which in no way concerned either Prussia or the North German\r\nConfederation, and which affected solely the personal relations\r\nbetween the Commander-in-Chief and a German officer, and those between\r\nthe head of the family and, not the royal family of Prussia,\r\nbut the entire family of Hohenzollern, or all the bearers of that\r\nname.\r\n\r\nIn France, however, a _casus belli_ was being sought against Prussia\r\nwhich should be as free as possible from German national coloring; and\r\nit was thought one had been discovered in the dynastic sphere by the\r\naccession to the Spanish throne of a candidate bearing the name of\r\nHohenzollern. In this the overrating of the military superiority of\r\nFrance and the underrating of the national feeling in Germany was\r\nclearly the chief reason why the tenability of this pretext was not\r\nexamined either with honesty or judgment. The German national outburst\r\nwhich followed the French declaration, and resembled a stream bursting\r\nits sluices, was a surprise to French politicians. They lived,\r\ncalculated, and acted on recollections of the Confederation of the\r\nRhine, supported by the attitude of certain West German ministers;\r\nalso by Ultramontane influences, in the hope that the conquests of\r\nFrance, \"_gesta Dei per Francos_,\" would make it easier in Germany to\r\ndraw further consequences from the Vatican council, with the support\r\nof an alliance with Catholic Austria. The Ultramontane tendencies of\r\nFrench policy were favorable to it in Germany and disadvantageous in\r\nItaly; the alliance with the latter being finally wrecked by the\r\nrefusal of France to evacuate Rome. In the belief that the French army\r\nwas superior the pretext for war was lugged out, as one may say, by\r\nthe hair; and, instead of making Spain responsible for its reputed\r\nanti-French election of a king, they attacked the German Prince who\r\nhad not refused to relieve the need of the Spaniards, in the way they\r\nthemselves wished, by the appointment of a useful king, and one who\r\nwould presumably be regarded as _persona grata_ in Paris; and the King\r\nof Prussia, whom nothing beyond his family name and his position as a\r\nGerman fellow-countryman had brought into connection with this Spanish\r\naffair. In the very fact that the French cabinet ventured to call\r\nPrussian policy to account respecting the acceptance of the election,\r\nand to do so in a form which, in the interpretation put upon it by the\r\nFrench papers, became a public threat, lay a piece of international\r\nimpudence which, in my opinion, rendered it impossible for us to draw\r\nback one single inch. The insulting character of the French demand was\r\nenhanced, not only by the threatening challenges of the French press,\r\nbut also by the discussions in parliament and the attitude taken by the\r\nministry of Gramont and Ollivier upon these manifestations. The utterance\r\nof Gramont in the session of the \"Corps Législatif\" of July 6:\r\n\r\n\"We do not believe that respect for the rights of a neighboring\r\npeople binds us to suffer a foreign Power to set one of its Princes\r\non the throne of Charles V. * * * This event will not come to pass,\r\nof that we are quite certain. * * * Should it prove otherwise we\r\nshall know how to fulfil our duty without shrinking and without\r\nweakness\"--this utterance was itself an official international threat,\r\nwith the hand on the sword hilt. The phrase, _La Prusse cane_ (Prussia\r\nclimbs down), served in the press to illustrate the range of the\r\nparliamentary proceedings of July 6 and 7; which, in my feeling,\r\nrendered all compliance incompatible with our sense of national honor.\r\n\r\nOn July 12 I decided to hurry off from Varzin to Ems to discuss with\r\nhis Majesty about summoning the Reichstag for the purpose of the\r\nmobilization. As I passed through Wussow my friend Mulert, the old\r\nclergyman, stood before the parsonage door and warmly greeted me; my\r\nanswer from the open carriage was a thrust in carte and tierce in the\r\nair, and he clearly understood that I believed I was going to war. As\r\nI entered the courtyard of my house at Berlin, and before leaving the\r\ncarriage, I received telegrams from which it appeared that the King\r\nwas continuing to treat with Benedetti, even after the French threats\r\nand outrages in parliament and in the press, and not referring him\r\nwith calm reserve to his ministers. During dinner, at which Moltke and\r\nRoon were present, the announcement arrived from the embassy in Paris\r\nthat the Prince of Hohenzollern had renounced his candidature in order\r\nto prevent the war with which France threatened us. My first idea was\r\nto retire from the service, because, after all the insolent challenges\r\nwhich had gone before, I perceived in this extorted submission a\r\nhumiliation of Germany for which I did not desire to be responsible.\r\nThis impression of a wound to our sense of national honor by the\r\ncompulsory withdrawal so dominated me that I had already decided to\r\nannounce my retirement at Ems. I considered this humiliation before\r\nFrance and her swaggering demonstrations as worse than that of Olmütz,\r\nfor which the previous history on both sides, and our want of\r\npreparation for war at the time, will always be a valid excuse. I took\r\nit for granted that France would lay the Prince's renunciation to her\r\naccount as a satisfactory success, with the feeling that a threat of\r\nwar, even though it had taken the form of international insult and\r\nmockery, and though the pretext for war against Prussia had been\r\ndragged in by the head and shoulders, was enough to compel her to draw\r\nback, even in a just cause; and that even the North German\r\nConfederation did not feel strong enough to protect the national honor\r\nand independence against French arrogance. I was very much depressed,\r\nfor I saw no means of repairing the corroding injury I dreaded to our\r\nnational position from a timorous policy, unless by picking quarrels\r\nclumsily and seeking them artificially. I saw by that time that war\r\nwas a necessity, which we could no longer avoid with honor. I\r\ntelegraphed to my people at Varzin not to pack up or start, for I\r\nshould be back again in a few days. I now believed in peace; but, as I\r\nwould not represent the attitude by which this peace had been\r\npurchased, I gave up the journey to Ems and asked Count Eulenburg to\r\ngo thither and represent my opinion to his Majesty. In the same sense\r\nI conversed with the Minister of War, von Roon: we had got our slap in\r\nthe face from France, and had been reduced, by our complaisance, to\r\nlook like seekers of a quarrel if we entered upon war, the only way in\r\nwhich we could wipe away the stain. My position was now untenable,\r\nsolely because, during his course at the baths, the King, under\r\npressure of threats, had given audience to the French ambassador for\r\nfour consecutive days, and had exposed his royal person to insolent\r\ntreatment from this foreign agent without ministerial assistance.\r\nThrough this inclination to take state business upon himself in person\r\nand alone, the King had been forced into a position which I could not\r\ndefend; in my judgment his Majesty while at Ems ought to have refused\r\nevery business communication from the French negotiator, who was not\r\non the same footing with him, and to have referred him to the\r\ndepartment in Berlin. The department would then have had to obtain his\r\nMajesty's decision by a representation at Ems, or, if dilatory\r\ntreatment were considered useful, by a report in writing. But his\r\nMajesty, however careful in his usual respect for departmental\r\nrelations, was too fond not indeed of deciding important questions\r\npersonally, but, at all events, of discussing them, to make a proper\r\nuse of the shelter with which the Sovereign is purposely surrounded\r\nagainst importunities and inconvenient questionings and demands. That\r\nthe King, considering the consciousness of his supreme dignity which\r\nhe possessed in so high a degree, did not withdraw at the very\r\nbeginning from Benedetti's importunity was to be attributed for the\r\nmost part to the influence exercised upon him by the Queen, who was at\r\nCoblenz close by. He was seventy-three years old, a lover of peace,\r\nand disinclined to risk the laurels of 1866 in a fresh struggle; but\r\nwhen he was free from the feminine influence, the sense of honor of\r\nthe heir of Frederick the Great and of a Prussian officer always\r\nremained paramount. Against the opposition of his consort, due to her\r\nnatural feminine timidity and lack of national feeling, the King's\r\npower of resistance was weakened by his knightly regard for the lady\r\nand his kingly consideration for a Queen, and especially for his own\r\nQueen. I have been told that Queen Augusta implored her husband with\r\ntears, before his departure from Ems to Berlin, to bear in mind Jena\r\nand Tilsit and avert war. I consider the statement authentic, even to\r\nthe tears.\r\n\r\nHaving decided to resign, in spite of the remonstrances which Roon\r\nmade against it, I invited him and Moltke to dine with me alone on the\r\n13th, and communicated to them at table my views and projects for\r\ndoing so. Both were greatly depressed, and reproached me indirectly\r\nwith selfishly availing myself of my greater facility for withdrawing\r\nfrom service. I maintained the position that I could not offer up my\r\nsense of honor to politics, that both of them, being professional\r\nsoldiers and consequently without freedom of choice, need not take the\r\nsame point of view as a responsible Foreign Minister. During our\r\nconversation I was informed that a telegram from Ems, in cipher, if I\r\nrecollect rightly, of about 200 \"groups,\" was being deciphered. When\r\nthe copy was handed to me it showed that Abeken had drawn up and\r\nsigned the telegram at his Majesty's command, and I read it out to my\r\nguests,[36] whose dejection was so great that they turned away from\r\nfood and drink. On a repeated examination of the document I lingered\r\nupon the authorization of his Majesty, which included a command,\r\nimmediately to communicate Benedetti's fresh demand and its rejection\r\nboth to our ambassadors and to the press. I put a few questions to\r\nMoltke as to the extent of his confidence in the state of our\r\npreparations, especially as to the time they would still require in\r\norder to meet this sudden risk of war. He answered that if there was\r\nto be war he expected no advantage to us by deferring its outbreak;\r\nand even if we should not be strong enough at first to protect all the\r\nterritories on the left bank of the Rhine against French invasion, our\r\npreparations would nevertheless soon overtake those of the French,\r\nwhile at a later period this advantage would be diminished; he\r\nregarded a rapid outbreak as, on the whole, more favorable to us than\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\nIn view of the attitude of France, our national sense of honor\r\ncompelled us, in my opinion, to go to war; and if we did not act\r\naccording to the demands of this feeling, we should lose, when on the\r\nway to its completion, the entire impetus towards our national\r\ndevelopment won in 1866 while the German national feeling south of the\r\nMain, aroused by our military successes in 1866, and shown by the\r\nreadiness of the southern states to enter the alliances, would have to\r\ngrow cold again. The German feeling, which in the southern states\r\nlived long with the individual and dynastic state feeling, had, up to\r\n1866, silenced its political conscience to a certain degree with the\r\nfiction of a collective Germany under the leadership of Austria,\r\npartly from South German preference for the old imperial State, partly\r\nin the belief of her military superiority to Prussia. After events had\r\nshown the incorrectness of that calculation, the very helplessness in\r\nwhich the South German states had been left by Austria at the\r\nconclusion of peace was a motive for the political Damascus that lay\r\nbetween Varnbüler's \"_Væ victis_\" and the willing conclusion of the\r\noffensive and defensive alliance with Prussia. It was confidence in\r\nthe Germanic power developed by means of Prussia, and the attraction\r\nwhich is inherent in a brave and resolute policy if it is successful,\r\nand then proceeds within reasonable and honorable limits. This nimbus\r\nhad been won by Prussia; it would have been lost irrevocably, or at\r\nall events for a long time, if in a question of national honor the\r\nopinion gained ground among the people that the French insult, _La\r\nPrusse cane_, had a foundation in fact.\r\n\r\nIn the same psychological train of thought in which during the Danish\r\nwar in 1864 I desired, for political reasons, that precedence should\r\nbe given not to the old Prussian, but to the Westphalian battalions,\r\nwho so far had had no opportunity of proving their courage under\r\nPrussian leadership, and regretted that Prince Frederick Charles had\r\nacted contrary to my wish, did I feel convinced that the gulf, which\r\ndiverse dynastic and family influences and different habits of life\r\nhad in the course of history created between the south and north of\r\nthe Fatherland, could not be more effectually bridged over than by a\r\njoint national war against the neighbor who had been aggressive for\r\nmany centuries. I remembered that even in the short period from 1813\r\nto 1815, from Leipzig and Hanau to Belle-Alliance, the joint\r\nvictorious struggle against France had rendered it possible to put an\r\nend to the opposition between a yielding Rhine-Confederation policy\r\nand the German national impetus of the days between the Vienna\r\ncongress and the Mainz commission of inquiry, days marked by the names\r\nof Stein, Görres, Jahn, Wartburg, up to the crime of Sand. The blood\r\nshed in common from the day when the Saxons came over at Leipzig down\r\nto their participation at Belle-Alliance under English command had\r\nfostered a consciousness before which the recollections of the\r\nRhine-Confederation were blotted out. The historical development in\r\nthis direction was interrupted by the anxiety aroused by the\r\nover-haste of the national craving for the stability of state\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nThis retrospect strengthened me in my conviction, and the political\r\nconsiderations in respect to the South German states proved applicable\r\nlikewise, _mutatis mutandis_, to our relations with the populations of\r\nHanover, Hesse, and Schleswig-Holstein. That this view was correct is\r\nshown by the satisfaction with which, at the present day, after a\r\nlapse of twenty years, not only the Holsteiners, but likewise the\r\npeople of the Hanse towns, remember the heroic deeds of their sons in\r\n1870. All these considerations, conscious and unconscious,\r\nstrengthened my opinion that war could be avoided only at the cost of\r\nthe honor of Prussia and of the national confidence in it. Under this\r\nconviction I made use of the royal authorization communicated to me\r\nthrough Abeken, to publish the contents of the telegram; and in the\r\npresence of my two guests I reduced the telegram by striking out\r\nwords, but without adding or altering, to the following form: \"After\r\nthe news of the renunciation of the hereditary Prince of Hohenzollern\r\nhad been officially communicated to the imperial government of France\r\nby the royal government of Spain, the French ambassador at Ems further\r\ndemanded of his Majesty the King that he would authorize him to\r\ntelegraph to Paris that his Majesty the King bound himself for all\r\nfuture time never again to give his consent if the Hohenzollerns\r\nshould renew their candidature. His Majesty the King thereupon decided\r\nnot to receive the French ambassador again, and sent to tell him\r\nthrough the aide-de-camp on duty that his Majesty had nothing further\r\nto communicate to the ambassador.\" The difference in the effect of the\r\nabbreviated text of the Ems telegram as compared with that produced by\r\nthe original was not the result of stronger words but of the form,\r\nwhich made this announcement appear decisive, while Abeken's version\r\nwould only have been regarded as a fragment of a negotiation still\r\npending, and to be continued at Berlin.\r\n\r\nAfter I had read out the concentrated edition to my two guests, Moltke\r\nremarked: \"Now it has a different ring; it sounded before like a\r\nparley; now it is like a flourish in answer to a challenge.\" I went on\r\nto explain: \"If in execution of his Majesty's order I at once\r\ncommunicate this text, which contains no alteration in or addition to\r\nthe telegram, not only to the newspapers, but also by telegraph to all\r\nour embassies, it will be known in Paris before midnight, and not only\r\non account of its contents, but also on account of the manner of its\r\ndistribution, will have the effect of a red rag upon the Gallic bull.\r\nFight we must if we do not want to act the part of the vanquished\r\nwithout a battle. Success, however, essentially depends upon the\r\nimpression which the origination of the war makes upon us and others;\r\nit is important that we should be the party attacked, and this Gallic\r\noverweening and touchiness will make us if we announce in the face of\r\nEurope, so far as we can without the speaking-tube of the Reichstag,\r\nthat we fearlessly meet the public threats of France.\"\r\n\r\nThis explanation brought about in the two generals a revulsion to a\r\nmore joyous mood, the liveliness of which surprised me. They had\r\nsuddenly recovered their pleasure in eating and drinking and spoke in\r\na more cheerful vein. Roon said: \"Our God of old lives still and will\r\nnot let us perish in disgrace.\" Moltke so far relinquished his passive\r\nequanimity that, glancing up joyously towards the ceiling and\r\nabandoning his usual punctiliousness of speech, he smote his hand upon\r\nhis breast and said: \"If I may but live to lead our armies in such a\r\nwar, then the devil may come directly afterwards and fetch away the\r\n'old carcass.'\" He was less robust at that time than afterwards, and\r\ndoubted whether he would survive the hardships of the campaign.\r\n\r\nHow keenly he wanted to put in practice his military and strategic\r\ntastes and ability I observed not only on this occasion, but also in the\r\ndays before the outbreak of the Bohemian war. In both cases I found my\r\nmilitary colleague in the King's service changed from his usual dry and\r\nsilent habit; he became cheerful, lively, even merry. In the June night\r\nof 1866, when I had invited him for the purpose of ascertaining whether\r\nthe march of the army could not be begun twenty-four hours sooner, he\r\nanswered in the affirmative and was pleasantly excited by the hastening\r\nof the struggle. As he left my wife's drawing-room with elastic step, he\r\nturned round at the door and asked me in a serious tone: \"Do you know\r\nthat the Saxons have _blown up_[37] the bridge at Dresden?\" Upon my\r\nexpression of amazement and regret he replied: \"Yes, with water, for the\r\ndust.\" An inclination to innocent jokes very seldom, in official\r\nrelations like ours, broke through his reserve. In both cases his love\r\nof combat and delight in battles were a great support to me in carrying\r\nout the policy I regarded as necessary, in opposition to the\r\nintelligible and justifiable aversion in a most influential quarter. It\r\nproved inconvenient to me in 1867, in the Luxemburg question, and in\r\n1875 and afterwards on the question whether it was desirable, as regards\r\na war which we should probably have to face sooner or later, to bring it\r\non _antici-pando_ before the adversary could improve his preparations. I\r\nhave always opposed the theory which says \"Yes\"; not only at the\r\nLuxemburg period, but likewise subsequently for twenty years, in the\r\nconviction that even victorious wars cannot be justified unless they are\r\nforced upon one, and that one cannot see the cards of Providence far\r\nenough ahead to anticipate historical development according to one's own\r\ncalculation. It is natural that in the staff of the army not only\r\nyounger officers, but likewise experienced strategists, should feel the\r\nneed of turning to account the efficiency of the troops led by them, and\r\ntheir own capacity to lead, and of making them prominent in history. It\r\nwould be a matter of regret if this effect of the military spirit did\r\nnot exist in the army; the task of keeping its results within such\r\nlimits as the nations' need of peace can justly claim is the duty of the\r\npolitical, not the military, heads of the State. That at the time of the\r\nLuxemburg question, during the crisis of 1875, invented by Gortchakoff\r\nand France, and even down to the most recent times, the staff and its\r\nleaders have allowed themselves to be led astray and to endanger peace,\r\nlies in the very spirit of the institution, which I would not forego. It\r\nonly becomes dangerous under a monarch whose policy lacks sense of\r\nproportion and power to resist one-sided and constitutionally\r\nunjustifiable influences.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: From _Bismarck: The Man and the Statesman._ Permission\r\nHarper & Brothers, New York.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: a gathering of, it is said, 30,000 at the Castle of\r\nHambach in the Palatinate; where speeches were made in favor of\r\nGermany, unity, and the Republic.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: An attempt made by a handful of students and peasants to\r\nblow up the Federal Diet in revenge for some Press regulations passed\r\nby it.

His Majesty, having told Count Benedetti that\r\nhe was awaiting news from the Prince, has decided, with reference to\r\nthe above demand, upon the representation of Count Eulenburg and\r\nmyself, not to receive Count Benedetti again, but only to let him be\r\ninformed through an aide-de-camp: That his Majesty had now received\r\nfrom the Prince confirmation of the news which Benedetti had already\r\nreceived from Paris, and had nothing further to say to the ambassador.\r\nHis Majesty leaves it to your Excellency whether Benedetti's fresh\r\ndemand and its rejection should not be at once communicated both to\r\nour ambassadors and to the press.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: Play on the word _gesprengt_.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBISMARCK AS AN ORATOR\r\n\r\nBy EDMUND VON MACH, PH.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nBismarck was not an orator in the ordinary sense of the word, nor did\r\nhe wish to be one. On the contrary, he looked with mistrust on\r\nsilver-tongued orators. \"You know,\" he said in the Diet on February 3,\r\n1866, \"I am not an orator.... I cannot appeal to your emotions with a\r\nclever play of words intended to obscure the subject-matter. My speech\r\nis simple and clear.\" And a few years later he said: \"Eloquence has\r\nspoiled many things in the world's parliaments. Too much time is\r\nwasted, because everybody who thinks he knows anything wishes to\r\nspeak, even if he has nothing new to say. More breath is wasted on the\r\nair than thought is bestowed on the questions under discussion.\r\nEverything has been settled in party caucuses, and in the House the\r\nrepresentatives talk for no other purpose than to show the people how\r\nclever they are, or to please the newspapers, which are expected to be\r\nlavish with their praise in return. If things go on like this, the\r\ntime will come when eloquence will be considered a common nuisance,\r\nand a man will be punished if he has spoken too long.\"\r\n\r\nBismarck's most famous words against mere eloquence were uttered in\r\nthe Reichstag on April 29, 1881: \"You must be something of a poet if\r\nyou wish to be a good orator, and you must possess the gift of\r\nimprovisation. When I was younger there were public entertainments in\r\nwhich music alternated with oratorical improvisations. The\r\nimprovisator was given a theme of which he knew nothing, and on which\r\nhe discoursed, often brilliantly. It even happened that he was\r\naltogether convincing until we remembered where we were. I am\r\nmerely saying this to show that we should not entrust the direction of\r\nbig affairs to the mere masters of eloquence any more than to the\r\nimprovisators. Least of all should these people be placed in charge of\r\nbureaus, or be given a minister's portfolio. I only wish to prove that\r\neloquence is a gift which exerts today an influence out of proportion\r\nto its worth. It is overestimated. A good orator must be something of\r\na poet, which means that he cannot be a stickler for truth and\r\nmathematical accuracy. He must be inspiring, quick, and excitable,\r\nable himself to kindle the enthusiasm of others. But a good orator I\r\nfear will rarely play a good game of whist or of chess, and will be\r\neven less satisfactory as a statesman. The emotional element and not\r\ncool reason must predominate in his make-up. Physiologically, I\r\nbelieve, the same man cannot be a good orator and a calm judge. I am\r\nreminded of the list of qualities enumerated by Mephisto in Goethe's\r\n_Faust_: 'The lion's strength, the deer's celerity.' Such things are\r\nnever found united in one human body. And thus we often find eloquence\r\novertopping and dangerously controlling reason, to the complete\r\nsatisfaction of thoughtless multitudes. But a man of discretion, cool\r\nand accurate in his deliberations, to whom we are glad to entrust the\r\ndirection of big and weighty matters, can scarcely ever be a perfect\r\norator.\"\r\n\r\nIn this last sentence Bismarck apparently wished to draw a line of\r\ndistinction between himself and some of his parliamentary opponents\r\nwhom he admired as fluent orators, but whose leadership he deemed to\r\nbe unsafe. If he considered himself a poor public speaker he was\r\ngreatly mistaken. His contemporaries held different views, and several\r\nof them fortunately were so deeply impressed by his power that they\r\nanalyzed the means with which he won his great parliamentary\r\nvictories. His bitter political opponent, Ludwig Bamberger, for\r\ninstance, said:\r\n\r\n\"Bismarck controls his audience by the noticeable force and the\r\nexhaustiveness of his mental labor. He has improved with\r\npractice, and the description of him given in 1866 is no longer quite\r\nfair--'No charm of voice, no sonorous phrases, nothing to captivate an\r\naudience. His voice while clear and distinct, is dry and\r\nunsympathetic. He speaks monotonously, with many pauses, at times he\r\nalmost stutters, as if an obstinate tongue refused to obey orders, and\r\nas if he had to wrestle for the adequate expression of his thoughts.\r\nHe rocks to and fro, somewhat restlessly, and in no relation to what\r\nhe is saying. But the longer he speaks the more he overcomes all\r\ndifficulties, he succeeds in adapting his words, without the least\r\nwaste, to his thoughts, and generally reaches a powerfully effective\r\nend.' It is still true that his words advance at first slowly, then\r\nwith a rush, and again haltingly. But for all those who do not\r\nconsider the even and melodious flow of an address to be its greatest\r\nperfection Bismarck's way of speaking is not without some charm. It\r\nenables the hearer to follow the mental exertions of the speaker, and\r\nthus rivets attention better than many a smooth and sonorous diction\r\nwhich glides along nicely because it has no inner difficulties to\r\novercome. Often Bismarck succeeds in taking hold of his subject with\r\ntrenchant wit, and in illustrating it with arguments which he boldly\r\ntakes from every day life.... We must confess that his speeches, if\r\nart-less, are yet full of imagery. His cool and clear mind does not\r\ndespise the charm of warm color, just as his robust constitution is\r\nnot void of nervous irritability. His ingenuous appearance, with which\r\nhe is apt to surprise an audience, should not win our ready\r\nconfidence, for all who have had to do with him know that his\r\nastonishingly intimate remarks are calculated to mislead by their\r\nexcessive frankness, or their excessive lack of it. If he dissembles,\r\nhe often misses his mark by exaggeration, and one can truly say that\r\nhe has deceived his opponents more frequently by speaking the truth\r\nthan by making false pretenses. Behind his blustering behavior you can\r\noften spy the merry wag. To his opponents he can be provoking,\r\nmalicious, even spiteful, but he is never false! He does not belong\r\nto that class of public men who believe that the world can be governed\r\nwith sentimental phrases, or that evil conditions are alleviated when\r\nthe discussion is interspersed with pompous generalities. On the\r\ncontrary, he loves to turn his phrases so that everything will appear\r\nin a strong and glaring light.\"\r\n\r\nAnother observer, quoted by Hans Kraemer in his \"Speeches of Prince\r\nBismarck,\" sums up his impressions as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Bismarck has before him a narrow strip of paper on which, in\r\npreparation, he has jotted down a few words with his inspired\r\nquill-pen. Occasionally he looks at his notes, while he is speaking,\r\nrocking himself very slowly to and fro, and twisting his thumbs. He\r\noften hesitates, almost stutters, and sometimes even makes a slip of\r\nthe tongue. He seems to be wrestling with his thoughts, while his\r\nwords seem to ascend against their wish, for he makes a very brief\r\npause after every two or three words.... He speaks without gestures,\r\npathos or intonation, and without emphasizing any of his words. Is\r\nthis the man who as early as 1847 was the leader of the nobility in\r\nthe old Diet and their quickest man at repartee; who, in 1849 and 1850\r\nas a member of the Second House and the United Parliament of Erfurt,\r\nwhipped the liberal majority to a frenzy of fury with his bitter and\r\npoignant speeches; who as the President of the Ministry since 1862 has\r\nfaced, almost alone, the solid phalanx of the Liberals, replying to\r\ntheir ebullitions of pride and confidence in their own strain, and\r\nanswering on the spot and with brilliant presence of mind their\r\nsarcastic and malicious attacks, yes even challenging them with witty\r\nimpromptus, and hurting his opponents to the core? Yes, he is the same\r\nman, and occasionally he can be as witty and bitter as he used to be.\r\nBut since his great victories he has shown the more serious demeanor\r\nof a statesman. He is calmly objective and conciliatory, as befits his\r\ngreatness, which is today universally recognized. The longer he\r\nspeaks the more the peculiar attractions of his way of speaking become\r\nmanifest. His expression is original and fresh, pithy and robust,\r\nhonest and straightforward.\"\r\n\r\nBismarck did not write out his speeches, and the published accounts of\r\nwhat he said are copied from the official stenographic reports.\r\nLogically Bismarck never left a sentence incomplete, but grammatically\r\nhe often did so when the wealth of ideas qualifying his main thought\r\nhad grown to greater proportions than he had anticipated. His diction\r\nwas at all times precise, which led to a multiplicity of\r\nqualifications--adjectives, appositions, adverbs, parentheses, and the\r\nlike. Desirous of convincing his hearers, he often felt the need of\r\nrepeating the same thought in various ways until he at last hammered\r\nit in, as it were, with one big blow--with one phrase easily\r\nremembered and readily quoted. It is these phrases which have given\r\nthe names to many of his speeches, namely: \"The Honest Broker,\"\r\n\"Practical Christianity,\" or \"We shall never go to Canossa.\"\r\n\r\nHe himself readily quoted from the sayings and writings of other great\r\nmen; and was in this respect wholly admirable both for the catholicity\r\nof his taste and the singular appropriateness of his citations. He was\r\napparently as familiar with the great authors of antiquity as with the\r\nmodern German, French and English writers. Nor was he afraid of using\r\na foreign tongue when no German phrase occurred to him to match the\r\nexact meaning of his thought.\r\n\r\nThe reader will realize, even more than the hearer, that it was not\r\nthe form of Bismarck's speeches which swept his audiences off their\r\nfeet, and often changed a hostile Reichstag or Diet into an assembly\r\nof men eager to do his bidding, but that it was his firm grasp on the\r\nrealities of life and his supreme command of everything which makes\r\nfor true statesmanship. His policies were not based on snap judgments,\r\nthey were the result of serious thought. All this showed in his\r\nspeeches, and made him one of the most powerfully effective speakers\r\nof all times.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_SPEECHES OF PRINCE BISMARCK_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPROFESSORIAL POLITICS\r\n\r\nDecember 21, 1863\r\n\r\nTRANSLATED BY EDMUND VON HACK, PH.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n[In the Prussian Diet the representative, Johann Ludwig Tellkampf,\r\nprofessor of economics and political science in the University of\r\nBreslau, had attacked the policy of Bismarck in regard to\r\nSchleswig-Holstein. Bismarck replied as follows:]\r\n\r\nThe conception which the previous speaker has of the politics of\r\nEurope reminds me of a man from the plains who is on his first journey\r\nto the mountains. When he sees a huge elevation loom up before him,\r\nnothing seems easier than to climb it. He does not even think that he\r\nwill need a guide, for the mountain is in plain sight, and the road to\r\nit apparently without obstacles. But when he starts, he soon comes\r\nupon ravines and crevasses which not even the best of speeches will\r\nhelp him to cross. The gentleman comforted us concerning similar\r\nobstacles in the path of politics by saying things like these: \"It is\r\nwell known that Russia can do nothing at present; it does not appear\r\nthat Austria will take a contrary step; England knows very well that\r\nher interests are counselling peace; and finally, France will not act\r\nagainst her national principles.\" If we should believe these\r\nassurances, and think more highly of the estimate which the gentleman\r\nhas made of the politics of Europe than of our own official judgment,\r\nand should thereby drive Prussia to an isolated and humiliating\r\nposition, could we then excuse ourselves by saying, \"We could see the\r\ndanger coming, but we trusted the speaker, thinking he knew probably\r\nmore than we?\" If this is impossible how can we attach to the remarks\r\nof the speaker the weight which he wishes us to attach to them!\r\n\r\nFor all official positions, those of the judges for instance and even\r\nthose of the subalterns in the army, we require examinations and a\r\npractical knowledge--difficult examinations. But high politics--oh,\r\nany one can practise them who feels himself called upon to do so.\r\nNothing is easier than to make endless assertions in this field of\r\nconjectures and to cast caution to the winds. You know that one must\r\nwrite a whole book to controvert one erroneous thought, and he who\r\nvoiced the error remains unconvinced. It is a dangerous and far-spread\r\nmistake which assumes that a naïve intuition will reveal to the\r\npolitical dilettante what remains hidden from the wisdom of the\r\nexpert.\r\n\r\n[Professor Tellkampf replied, in great excitement: \"My whole life as a\r\nprofessor of political science has been devoted to the study of\r\npolitics, and I should like to ask the president of the ministry,\r\nwhether he knew more of political science, when he began his political\r\ncareer as a dike-master, than a professor of this science knows?\" To\r\nwhich Bismarck replied:]\r\n\r\nI do not at all deny the familiarity of the previous speaker with\r\npolitical theories. But he has wandered from the field of theory into\r\nthat of practice. He has announced with complete assurance to me and\r\nto this assembly what each European cabinet will probably do in this\r\nconcrete case. These are the very things which, I believe, I must know\r\nbetter than he. This belief I have expressed. The previous speaker has\r\nreferred to his activity in theoretical politics as a professor\r\nthrough many years. If the gentleman had served even one year in\r\npractical politics, possibly as a bureau chief in the ministry of\r\nforeign affairs, he would not have said what he said today from the\r\nspeaker's desk. And his advice, after this one year of practical\r\ntraining, would be of greater value to me than if he had been active,\r\neven more years than he says, as a professor on the lecture platform.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH FROM THE THRONE\r\n\r\nWritten by Bismarck and delivered by William I., July 19, 1870\r\n\r\nTRANSLATED BY EDMUND VON MACH, PH.D.\r\n\r\n[Disturbed by the increasing bonds of union between the northern and\r\nthe southern German states, in which France saw a lessening of her own\r\nprestige across the Rhine, the ministers of Napoleon III. had decided\r\non war against Prussia. They found a pretext in the candidacy of a\r\nHohenzollern prince for the throne of Spain. Contrary to diplomatic\r\nusage, they requested the King of Prussia to force the withdrawal of\r\nthe prince, and even when the father of the prince announced the\r\nwithdrawal of his son, they were not satisfied, but instructed\r\nBenedetti, the French ambassador, to secure from the King of Prussia a\r\nhumiliating promise for the future. The King indignantly refused, and\r\nBismarck published the occurrence in the famous \"Despatch of Ems,\"\r\nJuly 13, 1870. Thereupon the French cabinet declared war, on July 15,\r\n1870. The formal notice was served on Bismarck, July 19, and on the\r\nsame day the King of Prussia opened a special session of the Reichstag\r\nwith the following address, which had been prepared by Bismarck.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN OF THE REICHSTAG OF THE NORTH GERMAN FEDERATION:\r\n\r\nWhen I welcomed you here at your last assembly, it was with joy and\r\ngratitude because God had crowned my efforts with success. I could\r\nannounce to you that every disturbance of peace had been avoided, in\r\nresponse to the wishes of the people and the demands of civilization.\r\n\r\nIf now the allied governments have been compelled by treats of war and\r\nits danger to summon you to a special session, you will feel not less\r\nconvinced than we that it was the wish of the North German Federation\r\nto develop the forces of the German people as a support of universal\r\npeace, and not as a possible source of danger to it. If we call upon\r\nthese forces today for the protection of our independence, we are\r\ndoing nothing but what honor and duty demand.\r\n\r\nThe candidacy of a German prince for the Spanish throne, with which\r\nthe allied governments had nothing to do--neither when it was pressed\r\nnor when it was withdrawn--and which interested the North German\r\nFederation only in so far as the government of a friendly nation\r\nseemed to expect of it the assurance of a peaceful and orderly\r\ngovernment for its much harassed land--this candidacy offered to the\r\nemperor of France the pretense of seeing in it a cause for war,\r\ncontrary to the long established custom of diplomacy. When the\r\npretense no longer existed, he kept to his views in utter disregard of\r\nthe rights which our people have to the blessings of peace--views\r\nwhich find their analogy in the history of former rulers of France.\r\n\r\nWhen in earlier centuries Germany suffered in silence such attacks on\r\nher rights and her honor, she did so because she was divided and did\r\nnot know her strength. Today when the bonds of the spiritual and\r\npolitical union, which began with the War of Liberation, are knitting\r\nthe German races more closely together as time advances, and when our\r\narmor no longer offers an opening to the enemy, Germany carries in her\r\nbosom the will and the strength to defend herself against renewed\r\nFrench violence.\r\n\r\nIt is not presumption which dictates these words. The allied\r\ngovernments and I myself--we are fully conscious of the fact that\r\nvictory and defeat rest with the Lord of battles. We have measured\r\nwith clear vision the responsibility which attaches, before God and\r\nmen, to him who drives two peace-loving peoples in the heart of Europe\r\nto war. The German and the French people, enjoying in equal measure\r\nthe blessings of Christian morals and o growing prosperity, are meant\r\nfor a more wholesome contest than the bloody contest of war.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRINCE BISMARCK FRANZ VON LENBACH]\r\n\r\nThe rulers of France, however, have known how to exploit by calculated\r\ndeception, the just, although excitable, pride of the great French\r\nnation in furtherance of their own interests and for the gratification\r\nof their own passions.\r\n\r\nThe more conscious the allied governments are of having done\r\neverything permitted by their honor and their dignity to preserve for\r\nEurope the blessings of peace, and the more apparent it is to\r\neverybody that the sword has been forced upon us, the greater is the\r\nconfidence with which we rely on the unanimous decision of the German\r\ngovernments of the South as well as of the North, and appeal to the\r\npatriotism and self-sacrifice of the German people, calling them to\r\nthe defense of their honor and their independence.\r\n\r\nWe shall fight, as our fathers did, against the violence of foreign\r\nconquerors, and for our freedom and our right. And in this fight, in\r\nwhich we have no other aim than that of securing for Europe lasting\r\npeace, God will be with us as He was with our fathers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALSACE-LORRAINE A GLACIS AGAINST FRANCE\r\n\r\nMay 2,1871\r\n\r\nTRANSLATED BY EDMUND VON MACH, PH.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n[After the war France had been obliged to return to Germany the two\r\nprovinces, Alsace and Lorraine, which she had attached to herself in\r\nthe times of Germany's weakness. It might have been better to unite\r\nthese provinces with one of the German states, but it was feared that\r\nso valuable an increase in territory of one of the twenty-five states\r\nthat had just been federated in the empire, might lead to renewed\r\ndissension. The suggestion, therefore, was made to administer the two\r\nprovinces, for the present, as common property, and to leave the final\r\narrangements to the future. A bill concerning the immediate\r\ndisposition of Alsace and Lorraine was submitted to the Reichstag on\r\nMay 2, 1871; when Prince Bismarck opened the discussion with the\r\nfollowing speech.]\r\n\r\nIn introducing the pending bill I shall have to say only a few words,\r\nfor the debate will offer me the opportunity of elucidating the\r\nvarious details. The underlying principles are, I believe, not subject\r\nto a difference of opinion; I mean the question whether Alsace and\r\nLorraine should be incorporated in the German empire. The form in\r\nwhich this should be done, and especially what steps should first be\r\ntaken, will be the subject of your deliberations. You will, moreover,\r\nfind the allied governments ready to weigh carefully all suggestions\r\ndifferent from our own which may be made in this connection.\r\n\r\nI believe that there will be no difference of opinion concerning the\r\nprinciple itself, because there was none a year ago, nor has any\r\nappeared during this year of the war. If we imagine ourselves back one\r\nyear--or more accurately ten months--we can say to ourselves that all\r\nGermany was agreed in her love of peace. There was not a German who\r\ndid not wish to be at peace with France, as long as this was honorably\r\npossible. Those morbid exceptions which possibly desired war in the\r\nhope of seeing their own country defeated--they are not worthy of\r\ntheir name, I do not count them among the Germans!\r\n\r\nI insist, the Germans were unanimous in their desire for peace. But\r\nwhen war was forced upon them, and they were compelled to take to\r\narms, then the Germans were fully as unanimous in their determination\r\nto look for assurances against the likelihood of another similar war,\r\nprovided God were to give them the victory in this one which they were\r\nresolved to wage manfully. If, however, another such war should occur\r\nin the future, they intended to see to it now, that our defence then\r\nwould be easier. Everyone remembered that there probably had not been\r\na generation of our fathers, for three hundred years, which had not\r\nbeen forced to draw the sword against France, and everybody knew the\r\nreason why Germany had previously missed the opportunity of securing\r\nfor herself a better protection against an attack from the west, even\r\nat those times when she had happened to be among the conquerors of\r\nFrance. It was because the victories had been won in company with\r\nallies whose interests were not ours. Everybody therefore was\r\ndetermined that if we should conquer this time, independently and\r\nsolely by our own might and right, we should strive to make the future\r\nmore secure for our children.\r\n\r\nIn the course of centuries the wars against France had resulted almost\r\nalways to our disadvantage, because Germany had been divided. This had\r\ncreated a geographical and strategic frontier which was full of\r\ntemptations for France and of menace for Germany. I cannot describe\r\nour condition before the last war, and especially that of South\r\nGermany, more strikingly than with the words of a thoughtful South\r\nGerman sovereign. When Germany was urged to take the part of the\r\nwestern powers in the oriental war, although her governments were not\r\nconvinced that this was in their interest, this sovereign--there is\r\nno reason why I should not name him, it was the late King William of\r\nWürtemberg--said to me: \"I share your view, that we have no call to\r\nmix in this war, and that no German interests are at stake of\r\nsufficient worth to spill a drop of German blood for them. But what\r\nwill happen if we should quarrel with the western powers on this\r\naccount? You may count on my vote in the Bundestag until war is at\r\nhand. Then conditions will be altered. I am as ready as the next man\r\nto fulfil my obligations. But take care lest you judge people\r\ndifferently from what they are. Give us Strassburg, and we shall be\r\nwith you at all hazards. As long as Strassburg is a sally-port for an\r\never armed force, I must fear that my country will be inundated by\r\nforeign troops before the North German Alliance can come to my\r\nassistance. Personally I shall not hesitate a moment to eat the hard\r\nbread of exile in your camp, but my people, weighed down by\r\ncontributions, will write to me urging a change of policy upon me. I\r\ndo not know what I shall do, nor whether all will remain sufficiently\r\nfirm. The crux of the situation is Strassburg, for as long as it is\r\nnot German, it will prevent South Germany from giving herself\r\nunreservedly to German unity and to a national German policy. As long\r\nas Strassburg is a sally-port for an ever ready army of from 100,000\r\nto 150,000 men, Germany will find herself unable to appear on the\r\nupper Rhine with an equally large army on time--the French will always\r\nbe here first.\"\r\n\r\nI believe this instance taken from an actual occurrence says\r\neverything. I need not add one word.\r\n\r\nThe wedge which Alsace pushed into Germany near Weissenburg separated\r\nSouth Germany from North Germany more effectively than the political\r\nline of the Main. It needed a high degree of determination, national\r\nenthusiasm, and devotion for our South German allies not to hesitate\r\none moment but to identify the danger of North Germany with their own\r\nand to advance boldly in our company, in spite of that other danger in\r\ntheir own immediate proximity to which a clever conduct of the war on\r\nthe part of France would have exposed them. That France in her\r\nsuperior position had been ready to yield to the temptation, which\r\nthis advanced outpost of Strassburg offered her against Germany,\r\nwhenever her internal affairs made an excursion into foreign lands\r\ndesirable, we had seen for many decades. It is well known that the\r\nFrench ambassador entered my office as late as August 6, 1866, with\r\nthe briefly worded ultimatum: \"Either cede to France the city of\r\nMayence, or expect an immediate declaration of war.\" I was, of course,\r\nnot one moment in doubt about my reply. I said to him: \"Well, then, it\r\nis war.\" He proceeded with this reply to Paris. There they changed\r\ntheir mind after a few days, and I was given to understand that this\r\ninstruction had been wrung from Emperor Napoleon during an attack of\r\nillness. The further attempts on Luxembourg and the consequent issues\r\nare known to you. I will not revert to them, nor do I believe that it\r\nis necessary to prove that France did not always show a sufficiently\r\nstrong character to resist the temptations which the possession of\r\nAlsace brought with it.\r\n\r\nThe question was, how to secure a guarantee against this. It had to be\r\nof a territorial nature, because the guarantees of foreign powers were\r\nnot of much use to us, such guarantees having at times been subject to\r\nsupplementary and attenuating declarations. One might have thought\r\nthat all Europe would have felt the need of preventing the ever\r\nrecurring wars of two great and civilized peoples in the heart of\r\nEurope, and that it would have been natural to assume that the\r\nsimplest way to do this was to strengthen the defences of that one of\r\nthe two participants who doubtless was the more pacific. I cannot,\r\nhowever, say that at first this idea appeared convincing everywhere.\r\nOther expedients were looked for, and the suggestion was often made\r\nthat we should be satisfied with an indemnity and the razing of the\r\nFrench fortresses in Alsace and Lorraine. This I always opposed,\r\nbecause I considered it an impracticable means of maintaining peace.\r\nThe establishment of an easement on foreign territory is very\r\noppressive and disagreeable to the sense of sovereignty and\r\nindependence of those who are affected by it. The cession of a\r\nfortress is felt scarcely more bitterly than the injunction by\r\nforeigners not to build on the territory which is under one's own\r\nsovereignty. French passions have probably been excited more\r\nfrequently and more successfully by a reference to the razing of that\r\nunimportant place of Hüningen than by the loss of any conquered\r\nterritory which France had to suffer in 1815. I placed, therefore, no\r\nconfidence in this means, especially since the geographical\r\nconfiguration of this advanced outpost--as I took the liberty of\r\ncalling it--would have put the starting place for the French troops\r\njust as near to Stuttgart and Munich as it had always been. It was\r\nimportant to put it farther back.\r\n\r\nMetz, moreover, is a place of such a topographical configuration, that\r\nvery little art is needed to transform it into a strong fortress. If\r\nanyone should destroy these additions to nature--which would be a very\r\nexpensive undertaking--they could be quickly restored. Consequently I\r\nlooked also upon this suggestion as insufficient.\r\n\r\nThere might have been one other means--and one which the inhabitants\r\nof Alsace and Lorraine favored--of founding there a neutral territory\r\nsimilar to Belgium and Switzerland. There would then have been a chain\r\nof neutral states from the North Sea to the Swiss Alps, which would\r\nhave made it impossible for us to attack France by land, because we\r\nare accustomed to respect treaties and neutrality, and because we\r\nshould have been separated from France by this strip of land between\r\nus. France would have received a protecting armor against us, but\r\nnothing would have prevented her from occasionally sending her fleet\r\nwith troops to our coast--a plan she had under consideration during\r\nthe last war, although she did not execute it--or from landing her\r\narmies with her allies, and entering Germany from there. France would\r\nhave received a protecting armor against us, but we should have been\r\nwithout protection by sea, as long as our navy did not equal the\r\nFrench. This was one objection, although one of only secondary\r\nimportance. The chief reason was that neutrality can only be\r\nmaintained when the inhabitants are determined to preserve an\r\nindependent and neutral position, and to defend it by force of arms,\r\nif need be. That is what both Belgium and Switzerland have done. As\r\nfar as we were concerned in the last war no action on their part would\r\nhave been necessary, but it is a fact that both these countries\r\nmaintained their neutrality. Both are determined to remain neutral\r\ncommonwealths. This supposition would not have been true, in the\r\nimmediate future, for the neutrality newly to be established in Alsace\r\nand Lorraine. On the contrary, it is to be expected that the strong\r\nFrench elements, which are going to survive in the country for a long\r\nwhile, and whose interests, sympathies, and memories are connected\r\nwith France, would have induced the people to unite with France in the\r\ncase of another Franco-German war, no matter who their sovereign might\r\nbe. The neutrality of Alsace-Lorraine, therefore, would have been\r\nmerely a sham, harmful to us and helpful to France. Nothing was left,\r\ntherefore, but to bring both these countries with their strong\r\nfortresses completely under German control. It was our purpose to\r\nestablish them as a powerful glacis in Germany's defence against\r\nFrance, and to move the starting point of a possible French attack\r\nseveral days' marches farther back, if France, having regained her\r\nstrength or won allies, should again throw down the gauntlet to us.\r\n\r\nThe chief obstacle to the realization of this idea, which was to\r\nsatisfy the incontestable demands of our safety, was found in the\r\nopposition of the inhabitants themselves, who did not wish to be\r\nseparated from France. It is not my duty here to inquire into the\r\ncauses which made it possible for a thoroughly German community to\r\nbecome so deeply attached to a country speaking a different tongue and\r\npossessing a government which was not always kind and considerate. To\r\na great extent this may have been due to the fact that all those\r\nqualities which distinguish the Germans from the French are found to\r\nsuch a high degree in Alsace-Lorraine, that the inhabitants of this\r\ncountry formed--I may say it without fear of seeming presumption--an\r\naristocracy in France as regards proficiency and exactness. They were\r\nbetter qualified for service, and more reliable in office. The\r\nsubstitutes in the army, the gendarmes, and the civil officers were\r\nfrom Alsace-Lorraine in numbers entirely out of proportion to the\r\npopulation of these provinces. There were one and one half million\r\nGermans who knew how to make use of these virtues among a people who\r\nhave other virtues but who are lacking in these particular ones.\r\nThanks to their excellence they enjoyed a favored position, which made\r\nthem unmindful of many legal iniquities. It is, moreover,\r\ncharacteristic of the Germans that every tribe lays claim to some kind\r\nof superiority, especially over its immediate neighbors. As long as\r\nthe people of Alsace and Lorraine were French, Paris with its splendor\r\nand the grandeur of a united France stood behind them; they could meet\r\ntheir fellow Germans with the consciousness that Paris was theirs, and\r\nthus find a reason for their sense of exclusive superiority. I do not\r\nwish to discuss further the reasons why everyone attaches himself more\r\nreadily to a big political system which gives scope to his abilities,\r\nthan to a divided, albeit related, nation, such as existed formerly on\r\nthis side of the Rhine, in so far as the Alsatians were concerned. The\r\nfact is that such disinclination existed, and that it is our duty to\r\novercome it by patience. We have, it seems to me, many means at our\r\ndisposal. We Germans are accustomed to govern more benevolently,\r\nsometimes more awkwardly--but in the long tun really more benevolently\r\nand humanely, than the French statesmen. This is a merit of the German\r\ncharacter which will soon appeal to the Alsatian heart and become\r\nmanifest. We are, moreover, able to grant the inhabitants a far\r\ngreater degree of communal and individual freedom than the French\r\ninstitutions and traditions ever permitted.\r\n\r\nIf we watch the present movement in Paris (the Commune), we shall\r\nfind, what is true of every movement possessing the least endurance,\r\nthat it contains at bottom a grain of sense in spite of all the\r\nunreasonable motives which attach to it, influencing its individual\r\npartisans. Without this no movement can attain even that degree of\r\nforce which the Commune exercises at present. This grain of sense--I\r\ndo not know how many people believe in it, but surely the most\r\nintelligent and best who at present are fighting against their\r\ncountrymen do believe in it--is, to put it briefly, the German\r\nmunicipal government. If the Commune possessed this, then the better\r\nelement of its supporters--I do not say all--would be satisfied. We\r\nmust differentiate according to the facts. The militia of the usurpers\r\nconsists largely of people who have nothing to lose. There are in a\r\ncity of two million inhabitants many so-called \"_repris de justice_,\"\r\nor as we should say \"people under police supervision,\" who are\r\nspending in Paris the interval between two terms in prison. They are\r\ncongregating in the city in considerable numbers and are ready to\r\nserve disorder and pillage wherever it may be. It is these people who\r\ngave to the movement, before we had scrutinized its theoretical aims,\r\nthe occasionally prominent character which seemed to threaten\r\ncivilization, and which, in the interest of humanity, I now hope has\r\nbeen overcome. It is, of course, quite possible that it may recur.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this flotsam, which is found in large masses in every\r\nbig city, the militia which I mentioned consists of many adherents of\r\nan international European republic. I have been told the figures with\r\nwhich the foreign nations are there represented, but I remember only\r\nthat almost eight thousand Englishmen are said to be in Paris for the\r\nsake of seeing the realization of their plans. I assume that these\r\nso-called Englishmen are largely Irish Fenians. And then there are\r\nmany Belgians, Poles, adherents of Garibaldi, and Italians. They\r\nare people who really do not care much for the \"Commune\" and French\r\nliberty. They expect something else, and they were, of course, not\r\nmeant, when I said that there is a grain of sense in every movement.\r\n\r\nThe needs and wishes of the large French communities are thoroughly\r\njustified, considering not only their own political past, which grants\r\nthem a very moderate amount of freedom, but also the tradition of the\r\nFrench statesmen who are offering to the cities their very best\r\npossible compromise with municipal freedom. The inhabitants of Alsace\r\nand Lorraine have felt these needs most forcefully owing to their\r\nGerman character, which is stronger than the French character in its\r\ndemands for individual and municipal independence. Personally I am\r\nconvinced that we can grant the people of Alsace and Lorraine, at the\r\nvery start, a freer scope in self government without endangering the\r\nempire as a whole. Gradually this will be broadened until it\r\napproaches the ideal, when every individual and every community\r\npossesses as much freedom as is at all compatible with the order of\r\nthe State as a whole. I consider it the duty of reasonable\r\nstatesmanship to try to reach this goal or to come as near to it as\r\npossible. And this is much easier, with our present German\r\ninstitutions, than it will ever be in France with the French character\r\nand the French centralized system of government. I believe, therefore,\r\nthat, with German patience and benevolence, we shall succeed in\r\nwinning the men of Alsace and Lorraine--perhaps in a briefer space of\r\ntime than people today expect.\r\n\r\nBut there will always be some residuary elements, rooted with every\r\npersonal memory in France and too old to be transplanted, or\r\nnecessarily connected with France by material interests. For them\r\nthere will be no compensation for the broken French bonds, or at least\r\nnone for some time to come. We must, therefore, not permit ourselves\r\nto believe that the goal is in sight, and that Alsace will soon be as\r\nintensely German in feeling as Thuringia. On the other hand, we need\r\nnot give up the hope of living to see the realization of our plans\r\nprovided we fulfill the time generally allotted to man.\r\n\r\nThe problem of how to approach this task, gentlemen, will now\r\nprimarily concern you. What should be the form of our immediate\r\nprocedure? for it should surely not bind us irrevocably for all the\r\nfuture. I would ask you not to deliberate as if you were to create\r\nsomething that will hold good for eternity. Do not endeavor to form a\r\ndefinite idea of the future as you may think it should be after the\r\nlapse of several decades. No man's foresight, I hold, can reach as far\r\nas that. The conditions are abnormal; they had to be so--our entire\r\ntask was so--not only as regards the mode of taking possession of\r\nAlsace, but also as regards the present owners. An alliance of\r\nsovereign princes and free cities making a conquest which it is\r\ncompelled to keep for its own protection, and which is, therefore,\r\nheld in joint possession, is very rare in history. It is in fact, I\r\nbelieve, unique, if we disregard a few ventures by some Swiss cantons,\r\nwhich after all did not intend to assimilate the countries which they\r\nhad jointly conquered, but rather to manage them as common provinces\r\nin the interest of the conquerors. Considering, therefore, the\r\nabnormal conditions and our abnormal task, we are most especially\r\ncalled upon to guard against overestimating the perspicacity in human\r\naffairs of even the most far sighted politicians. I for one do not\r\nfeel capable of foretelling with certainty what the conditions in\r\nAlsace-Lorraine will be three years hence. To do this one would need\r\nan eye capable of piercing the future. Everything depends on factors\r\nwhose development, conduct, and good will are beyond our power of\r\nregulation. What we are proposing to you is merely an attempt to find\r\nthe right beginning of a road, the end of which we shall know only\r\nwhen we have been taught the necessary lessons by actual experience\r\nwith the conditions of the future. Let me ask you, therefore, to\r\nfollow at first the same empirical road which the governments have\r\nfollowed, and to take conditions as they are, and not as we may wish\r\nthey should be. If one has nothing better to put in the place of\r\nsomething that one does not entirely like, one had better, I believe,\r\nlet matters take their own course, and rest satisfied at first with\r\nconditions as they are. As a matter of fact the allied governments\r\nhave jointly taken these countries, while their common possession and\r\ncommon administration, although constituting an established premise,\r\nmay be modified in future by our own necessities and the needs of the\r\npeople of Alsace and Lorraine. As regards the definite form which the\r\nproposition may take some day, I sincerely urge you to follow the lead\r\nof the governments and to defer your judgment. If you are bolder than\r\nwe are in prejudging what will happen, we shall gladly meet your\r\nwishes, since we must work together. The caution with which I have\r\nannounced to you the convictions of the allied governments, and with\r\nwhich these governments have formed their convictions, is an\r\nindication to you of our willingness to be set right, if you should\r\noffer us a better plan, especially if experience--even a short\r\nexperience--should have proved it to be a better plan.\r\n\r\nWhen I announce to you our willingness to work hand in hand with you,\r\nyou are, I am sure, equally ready to join us in exercising German\r\npatience and German love toward all, and especially toward our new\r\ncountrymen, and in endeavoring to discover, and finally to reach, the\r\nright goal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWE SHALL NEVER GO TO CANOSSA!\r\n\r\nMay 14, 1872\r\n\r\nTRANSLATED BY EDMUND VON MACH, PH.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Early in 1872 the German government tried to bring about a peaceful\r\nunderstanding with the ultramontane (i. e., Catholic) party by\r\ncourteous advances made to the pope. The cardinal prince\r\nHohenlohe-Schillings-fürst was designated as ambassador to His\r\nHoliness the Pope who was asked whether the prince would be\r\nacceptable. The pope replied in the negative, and thereby deeply hurt\r\nthe emperor. When the expenses of this post in the budget were under\r\ndiscussion in the Reichstag, Mr. von Bennigsen expressed the hope that\r\nthey would be struck from the budget in future, to which Bismarck\r\nreplied as follows:]\r\n\r\nI can readily understand how the idea may arise that the expenses for\r\nthis embassy have become unnecessary, because there is no longer a\r\nquestion here of protecting German subjects in those parts. I am,\r\nnevertheless, glad that no motion has been made to abolish this\r\nposition, for it would have been unwelcome to the government.\r\n\r\nThe duties of an embassy are in part, it is true, the protection of\r\nits countrymen, but in part also the mediation of the political\r\nrelations which the government of the empire happens to maintain with\r\nthe court where the ambassador is accredited. There is no foreign\r\nsovereign authorized by the present state of our legislation to\r\nexercise as extensive rights within the German empire as the pope.\r\nWhile these rights are almost those of a sovereign, they are not\r\nguarded by any constitutional responsibility. Considerable importance,\r\ntherefore, attaches to the kind of diplomatic relations which the\r\nGerman empire is able to maintain with the head of the Roman Church,\r\nwho exerts such a remarkably strong and, for a foreign sovereign,\r\nunusual influence among us. Considering the prevailing tendencies of\r\nthe Catholic Church at the present time, I scarcely believe that any\r\nambassador of the German empire would succeed in inducing His Holiness\r\nthe Pope, by the most skilful diplomacy and by persuasion, to modify\r\nthe position which he has taken, on principle, in all secular affairs.\r\nThere can, of course, be no question here of forceful actions, such as\r\nmay occur between two secular powers. In view of the recently\r\npromulgated doctrines of the Catholic Church, I deem it impossible for\r\nany secular power to reach a concordat without effacing itself to a\r\ndegree and in a way which, to the German empire at least, is\r\nunacceptable. You need not be afraid, we shall never go to Canossa,\r\neither actually or in spirit.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I cannot deny that the position of the empire as regards\r\nits religious peace is somewhat shaken. It is not my duty here to\r\ninvestigate motives, or to ask which one of the two parties is at\r\nfault, but to defend an item of the budget. The united governments of\r\nthe German empire are searching eagerly and, in justice to their\r\nCatholic and their Evangelical subjects, diligently for means which\r\nwill secure a more agreeable state of affairs than the present, and\r\nwhich will do so as peacefully as possible, and without unnecessarily\r\ndisturbing the religious relations of the empire. I doubt whether this\r\ncan be done except by legislation--I mean general and national\r\nlegislation, for which the governments will have to ask for the\r\nassistance of the Reichstag.\r\n\r\nBut you will agree with me that this legislation should proceed with\r\ngreat moderation and delicacy, and with due regard for every one's\r\nfreedom of conscience. The governments must be careful to avoid\r\nanything which will render their task more difficult, such as errors\r\nof information or ignorance of the proper forms, and must strive to\r\nreadjust their internal peace with tender regard for religious\r\nsensibilities, even those which are not shared by all. In this\r\nconnection it is, of course, necessary that the Holy See should be at\r\nall times well informed of the intentions of the German governments,\r\ncertainly more so than has been the case heretofore. One of the chief\r\ncauses of the present disturbance in religious matters is, I believe,\r\nthe misinformation which has reached His Holiness the Pope concerning\r\nthe conditions in Germany and the intentions of the German\r\ngovernments, and which has been due either to excitement or to the\r\nwrong color given it by evil motives.\r\n\r\nI had hoped that the choice of an ambassador, who possessed the full\r\nconfidence of both parties, would be welcome in Rome, of a man who\r\nloves truth and deserves confidence, and whose character and bearing\r\nare conciliatory; in short, of a man like the well known prince of the\r\nChurch whom His Majesty the Emperor had appointed to this post. I had\r\nhoped that this choice would be regarded as a pledge of our peaceful\r\nattitude and willingness to make advances, and would serve as a bridge\r\nto a mutual understanding. I had hoped that it would give the\r\nassurance that we should never ask anything of His Holiness the Pope\r\nbut what a prince of the Church, allied to him by the most intimate\r\nties, could present and convey to him, and that the forms would always\r\nbe in keeping with those which characterize the intercourse of one\r\nprince of the Church with another. This would have avoided all\r\nunnecessary friction in a case which is difficult enough.\r\n\r\nMany fears were expressed both by the Protestants and the liberals\r\nconcerning this appointment, based, I believe, on an erroneous\r\ninterpretation of the position of an envoy or an ambassador. An\r\nambassador really is a vessel which reaches its full value only when\r\nit is filled with the instructions of its master. In such delicate\r\nmatters as these, however, it is desirable that the vessel should be\r\nagreeable and acceptable, and that it should be incapable of\r\ncontaining poisons or potions without immediately revealing them, as\r\npeople used to say of ancient crystals. Unfortunately, and for\r\nreasons which have not yet been given, these intentions of the\r\nImperial Government could not be carried out because they met with a\r\ncurt refusal on the part of the Holy See. I can truly say that such a\r\ncase does not often happen. When a sovereign has made his choice of an\r\nambassador, it is customary for him to inquire, from courtesy, whether\r\nthe ambassador will be _persona grata_ with the sovereign to whom he\r\nwill be accredited, but the receipt of a negative reply is most\r\nunusual, for it necessitates the repeal of an appointment already\r\nmade. What the emperor can do toward the appointment he does before\r\nasking the question. In other words he has made the appointment before\r\nhe asks the question. The negative reply, therefore, is a demand that\r\na step once taken shall be repealed, a declaration which says: \"You\r\nhave made a wrong choice!\"\r\n\r\nI have been foreign minister for about ten years, and have been\r\nengaged in questions of higher diplomacy for twenty-one years, and I\r\nam not mistaken, I believe, when I say that this is the first and only\r\ncase in my experience where such a question has been answered in the\r\nnegative. I have known more than once of doubts expressed concerning\r\nambassadors who had served for some time, and of courts confidentially\r\nconveying their wish that a change be made in the person accredited to\r\nthem. In every case, however, the court had had the experience of\r\ndiplomatic relations with the particular person through several years,\r\nand was convinced that he was not qualified to safeguard the good\r\nrelations which it wished to maintain with us. It explained,\r\ntherefore, in a most confidential and delicate way, generally by means\r\nof an autograph letter from one sovereign to the other, why it had\r\ntaken this step. Such requests are rarely, if ever, made\r\nunconditionally. In recent times, as you know, a few cases have\r\noccurred, one of which at least was a very flagrant one, when the\r\nrecall of an ambassador was demanded; but as I have said, I do not\r\nremember another instance where an ambassador was refused when he was\r\nto be newly appointed. My regrets at this refusal are exceedingly\r\nkeen, but I am not justified in translating these regrets into a\r\nfeeling of vexation, for in justice to our Catholic fellow-citizens\r\nthe Government should not relax its exertions in trying to find ways\r\nand means of regulating the dividing line between the spiritual and\r\nthe secular powers. Such a division is absolutely necessary in the\r\ninterest of our internal peace, and it should be brought about in the\r\nmost delicate manner, and in a way which will give least offence to\r\neither confession. I shall, therefore, not be discouraged by what has\r\nhappened, but shall continue to use my influence with his Majesty the\r\nEmperor to the end that a representative of the empire may be found\r\nfor Rome who enjoys the confidence of both powers, if not in equal\r\nmeasure, at least in measure sufficient for his duties. I cannot, of\r\ncourse, deny that our task has been rendered decidedly more difficult\r\nby what has happened.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBISMARCK AS THE \"HONEST BROKER\"\r\n\r\nFebruary 19, 1878\r\n\r\nTRANSLATED BY EDMUND VON MACH, PH.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The complete victory which Russia had won in the Turkish war had\r\ngreatly disturbed the European powers, and in Germany much\r\napprehension was felt for the safety of Austria. England, too, was\r\nmuch concerned, for she had been displeased at Bismarck's refusal to\r\nintervene in the war. German public opinion was aroused, and the\r\nrepresentative von Bennigsen joined with four colleagues in the\r\nfollowing interpellation, which they made in the Reichstag on February\r\n8: \"Is the Chancellor willing to inform the Reichstag of the political\r\nsituation in the Orient, and of the position which the German empire\r\nhas taken or intends to take in regard to it?\" The interpellation was\r\nput on the calendar of February 19, and while Bismarck regarded it as\r\nill timed he was ready to reply, lest his silence be misunderstood.]\r\n\r\nI first ask the indulgence of the Reichstag if I should not be able to\r\nstand while I say everything I have to say. I am not so well as I\r\nlook.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the question, I cannot deny that I was in doubt, when I\r\nfirst saw the interpellation, not whether I would answer it--for its\r\nform gives me the right to answer it with a \"No\"--but whether I should\r\nnot have to say \"No.\" Do not assume, gentlemen, as one generally does\r\nin such cases, that the reason was because I had to suppress a good\r\ndeal which would compromise our policy or restrict it in an\r\nundesirable manner. On the contrary, I have hardly enough to say in\r\naddition to what is already generally known to induce me, of my own\r\ninitiative, to make a statement to the representatives of the empire.\r\n\r\nThe discussions in the English parliament have almost exhaustively\r\nanswered one part of the question \"What is the political\r\nsituation in the Orient at the present time?\" If, in spite of the\r\npaucity of the information with which I am addressing you, I do not\r\nsay \"No\" it is because I fear the inference that I have much to\r\nsuppress, and because such an inference is always disquieting,\r\nespecially when it is coupled with the desire to make capital out of\r\nmy silence. I am the more pleased to address you with complete\r\nfrankness, because the interpellation and the way it was introduced\r\nhave given me the impression that if the German policy wishes to\r\ncorrespond to the majority opinion of the Reichstag--in so far as I\r\nmay consider the recent comments an expression of this opinion--it has\r\nonly to continue along the path which it has thus far followed.\r\n\r\nRegarding the present situation, I suspect that you already know\r\neverything I can say about it. You know from the press and the English\r\nparliamentary debates that at present one can say in the Orient, \"The\r\narms are idle, and the storms of war are hushed\"--God grant, for a\r\nlong while! The armistice which has been concluded grants the Russian\r\narmy an unbroken position from the Danube to the sea of Marmora, with\r\na base which it lacked formerly. I mean the fortresses near the\r\nDanube. This fact, which is nowhere denied, seems to me to be the most\r\nimportant of the whole armistice. There is excluded from the Russian\r\noccupation, if I begin in the north, a quadrangular piece, with Varna\r\nand Shumla, extending along the shore of the Black Sea to Battshila in\r\nthe north, and not quite to the Bay of Burgas in the south, thence\r\ninland to about Rasgrad--a pretty exact quadrangle. Constantinople and\r\nthe peninsula of Gallipoli are also excluded, the very two points on\r\nwhose independence of Russia several interested powers are laying much\r\nstress.\r\n\r\nCertain peace preliminaries preceded the armistice, which at the risk\r\nof telling you things you already know I shall nevertheless review\r\nbecause they will answer the question whether German interests are at\r\nstake in any one of them. There is, in the first place, the\r\nestablishment of Bulgaria \"within the limits determined by the\r\nmajority of the Bulgarian population, and not smaller than indicated\r\nby the conference of Constantinople.\"\r\n\r\nThe difference between these two designations is not of sufficient\r\nimportance, I believe, to constitute a reasonable danger to the peace\r\nof Europe. The ethnographical information which we possess is, it is\r\ntrue, not authentic nor without gaps, and the best we know has been\r\nsupplied by Germans in the maps by Kiepert. According to this the\r\nnational frontier--the frontier of the Bulgarian nationality--runs\r\ndown in the west just beyond Salonica, along a line where the races\r\nare rather unmixed, and in the east with an increased admixture of\r\nTurkish elements in the direction of the Black Sea. The frontier of\r\nthe conference, on the other hand, so far as it is possible to trace\r\nit, runs--beginning at the sea--considerably farther north than the\r\nnational frontier, and two separate Bulgarian provinces are\r\ncontemplated. In the west it reaches somewhat farther than the\r\nnational frontier into the districts which have an admixture of\r\nAlbanian races. The constitution of Bulgaria according to the\r\npreliminaries would be similar to that of Servia before the evacuation\r\nof Belgrade and other strongholds; for this first paragraph of the\r\npreliminaries closes with these words, \"The Ottoman army will not\r\nremain there,\" and, in parenthesis, \"barring a few places subject to\r\nmutual agreement.\"\r\n\r\nIt will, therefore, devolve upon the powers who signed the Paris\r\ntreaty of 1856 to discuss and define those sentences which were left\r\nopen and indefinite there, and to come to an agreement with Russia, if\r\nthis is possible, as I hope it may be.\r\n\r\nThen there follow \"The Independence of Montenegro * * * also of\r\nRoumania and Servia;\" and directions concerning Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, whose reforms \"should be analogous.\"\r\n\r\nNone of these things, I am convinced, touches the interests of Germany\r\nto such an extent that we should be justified in jeopardizing for\r\nits sake our relations with our neighbors--our friends. We may accept\r\none or the other definition without loss in our spheres of interest.\r\n\r\nThen there follows, under paragraph five, a stipulation concerning the\r\nindemnity of war, which leaves the question open, whether \"it should\r\nbe pecuniary or territorial.\" This is a matter which concerns the\r\nbelligerents in so far as it may be pecuniary, and the signers of the\r\nParis treaty of peace in so far as it may be territorial, and will\r\nhave to be settled by their consent.\r\n\r\nThen there follows the provision concerning the Dardanelles. This, I\r\nbelieve, has given cause for much more anxiety in the world than is\r\njustified by the actual possibilities of any probable outcome. \"His\r\nMajesty the Sultan declares his willingness to come to an agreement\r\nwith His Majesty the Emperor of Russia with a view of safeguarding the\r\nrights and interests of Russia in the straits of the Bosphorus and the\r\nDardanelles.\"\r\n\r\nThe question of the Dardanelles is freighted with importance when it\r\nmeans placing the control there--the key of the Bosphorus--in other\r\nhands than heretofore, and deciding whether Russia shall be able to\r\nclose and to open the Dardanelles at will. All other stipulations can\r\nhave reference only to times of peace, for in the more important times\r\nof war the question will always hinge on whether the possessor of the\r\nkey to the Dardanelles is in alliance with or dependent on those\r\nliving outside or inside the Dardanelles, on Russia or on the\r\nopponents of Russia. In case of war, I believe no stipulation which\r\nmay be made will have the importance which people fear, provided the\r\nDardanelles are in times of peace in the possession of people who are\r\nfully independent of Russia. It may be of interest for the people on\r\nthe shores of the Mediterranean to know whether the Russian Black Sea\r\nfleet shall be permitted in times of peace to sail through the\r\nDardanelles and to show itself on their shores. If, however, it shows\r\nitself there, I should infer Peace, like good weather from the\r\nbarometer; when it withdraws and carefully secludes itself, then it\r\nis time to suspect that clouds are gathering. The question, therefore,\r\nwhether men-of-war shall be permitted to pass the Dardanelles in times\r\nof peace, although by no means unimportant, is to my way of thinking\r\nnot sufficiently important to inflame Europe.\r\n\r\nThe question whether the possession of the Dardanelles shall be\r\nshifted to other owners is entirely different. It constitutes,\r\nhowever, a conjectural eventuality which the present situation does\r\nnot contemplate, I believe, and on which I shall, therefore, express\r\nno opinion. My only concern at present is to give an approximate\r\ndefinition, as best I can, of those weighty interests which may lead\r\nto another war after the Russian-Turkish war has been actually\r\nconcluded. For this reason I deem it important to affirm that the\r\nstipulations of peace concerning the Dardanelles mean less for the\r\nmen-of-war than for the merchant marine. The preëminent German\r\ninterest in the Orient demands that the waterways, the straits as well\r\nas the Danube from the Black Sea upward, shall continue as free and\r\nopen to us as they have been until now. I rather infer that we shall\r\nsurely obtain this, for as a matter of fact it has never even been\r\nquestioned. An official communication on this point which I have\r\nreceived from St. Petersburg simply refers to the existing\r\nstipulations of the treaty of Paris. Nothing is jeopardized; our\r\nposition can be no worse and no better than it has been.\r\n\r\nThe interest which we have in a better government of a Christian\r\nnation and in the safeguards against those acts of violence which have\r\noccurred at times, under Turkish rule, is taken care of by the\r\nagreements mentioned above. And this is the second interest which\r\nGermany has in this whole affair. It is less direct, but is dictated\r\nby humanity.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the preliminary stipulations consists--I will not say of\r\nphrases, for it is an official paper--but it has no bearing on our\r\npresent discussion.\r\n\r\nWith these explanations I have answered to the best of my ability the\r\nfirst part of the interpellation concerning the present state of\r\naffairs in the Orient, and I fear, gentlemen, that I have said nothing\r\nnew to any one of you.\r\n\r\nThe other parts of the question refer to the position which Germany\r\nhas taken or intends to take in view of the now existing conditions\r\nand innovations.\r\n\r\nAs to the position which we have already taken I cannot now give you\r\nany information, for officially we have been in possession of the\r\npapers to which I have referred only a very short while, I may say\r\nliterally only since this very morning. What we knew beforehand was in\r\ngeneral agreement with these papers, but not of a nature to make\r\nofficial steps possible. It consisted of private communications for\r\nwhich we were indebted to the courtesy of other governments.\r\n\r\nOfficial steps, therefore, have not yet been taken, and would be\r\npremature in view of the conference, which I hope is at hand. All this\r\ninformation will then be available and we shall be in a position to\r\nexchange opinions concerning these matters. Any alterations,\r\ntherefore, of the stipulations of 1856 will have to be sanctioned. If\r\nthey should not be, the result would not necessarily be another war,\r\nbut a condition of affairs which all the powers of Europe, I think,\r\nhave good cause to avoid. I am almost tempted to call it making a\r\nmorass of matters. Let us assume that no agreement about what has to\r\nbe done can be reached in the conference, and that the powers who have\r\na chief interest in opposing the Russian stipulations should say: \"At\r\nthe present moment it does not suit us to go to war about these\r\nquestions, but we are not in accord with your agreements, and we\r\nreserve our decision\"--would not that establish a condition of affairs\r\nwhich cannot be agreeable even to Russia? The Russian policy rightly\r\nsays, \"We are not desirous of exposing ourselves to the necessity of a\r\nTurkish campaign every ten or twenty years, for it is exhausting,\r\nstrenuous, and expensive.\" But the Russian policy, on the other\r\nhand, cannot wish to substitute for this Turkish danger an\r\nEnglish-Austrian entanglement recurring every ten or twenty years. It\r\nis, therefore, my opinion that Russia is equally interested with the\r\nother powers in reaching an agreement now, and in not deferring it to\r\nsome future and perhaps less convenient time.\r\n\r\nThat Russia could possibly wish to force the other powers by war to\r\nsanction the changes which she deems necessary I consider to be beyond\r\nthe realm of probability. If she could not obtain the sanction of the\r\nother signers of the clauses of 1856, she would, I suppose, be\r\nsatisfied with the thought \"_Beati possidentes_\" (happy are the\r\npossessors). Then the question would arise whether those who are\r\ndissatisfied with the Russian agreements and have real and material\r\ninterests at stake, would be ready to wage war in order to force\r\nRussia to diminish her demands or to give up some of them. If they\r\nshould be successful in forcing Russia to give up more than she could\r\nbear, they would do so at the risk of leaving in Russia, when the\r\ntroops come home, a feeling similar to that in Prussia after the\r\ntreaties of 1815, a lingering feeling that matters really are not\r\nsettled, and that another attempt will have to be made.\r\n\r\nIf this could be achieved by a war, one would have to regard, as the\r\naim of this war, the expulsion of Russia from the Bulgarian\r\nstrongholds which she is at present occupying, and from her position\r\nwhich no doubt is threatening Constantinople--although she has given\r\nno indication of a wish to occupy this city. Those who would have\r\naccomplished this by a victorious war, would then have to shoulder the\r\nresponsibility of deciding what should be done with these countries of\r\nEuropean Turkey. That they should be willing simply to reinstate the\r\nTurkish rule in its entirety after everything said and determined in\r\nthe conference, is, I believe, very improbable. They would, therefore,\r\nbe obliged to make some kind of a disposition, which could not differ\r\nvery much in principle from what is being proposed now. It might\r\ndiffer in geographical extent and in the degree of independence, but I\r\ndo not believe that Austria-Hungary, for instance, the nearest\r\nneighbor, would be ready to accept the entire heritage of the present\r\nRussian conquest, and be responsible for the future of these Slavic\r\ncountries, either by incorporating them in the state of Hungary or\r\nestablishing them as dependencies. I do not believe that this is an\r\nend which Austria can much desire in view of her own Slavic subjects.\r\nShe cannot wish to be the editor of the future in the Balkan\r\npeninsula, as she would have to be if she won a victory.\r\n\r\nI mention all these eventualities, in which I place no faith, for the\r\nsake of proving how slight the reasonable probability of a European\r\nwar appears to be. It is not reasonably probable that the greater or\r\nlesser extent of a tributary State--unless conditions were altogether\r\nunbearable--should induce two neighboring and friendly powers to start\r\na destructive European war in cold blood! The blood will be cooler, I\r\nassure you, when we have at last come together in a conference.\r\n\r\nIt was to meet these eventualities that the idea of a conference was\r\nfirst proposed by the government of Austria-Hungary. We were from the\r\nstart ready to accept it, and we were almost the first to do so.\r\nConcerning the selection of a place where the conference should be\r\nheld, difficulties arose which I consider out of proportion to the\r\nsignificance of the whole matter. But even in this direction we have\r\nraised no objections and declared ourselves satisfied with the places\r\nwhich have been mentioned. They were Vienna, Brussels, Baden-Baden,\r\nWiesbaden, Wildbad, a place in Switzerland--I should, however, say\r\nWildbad was mentioned by no one but itself. Stuttgart was also\r\nmentioned. Any of these places would have been agreeable to us. It now\r\nseems--if I am correctly informed, and the decision must be made in a\r\nfew days--that the choice will fall on Baden-Baden. Our interest,\r\nwhich is shared by those powers with whom we have corresponded, is the\r\ndespatch of the conference irrespective of the choice of a place,\r\nwhich is for us of little consequence. As regards places in Germany I\r\nhave expressed no opinion beyond this, that on German soil the\r\npresidency would have to be German. This view has nowhere been\r\nopposed. After the general acceptance of this principle it will depend\r\non the men sent to attend this conference whether for reasons of\r\nexpediency it must be adhered to. Personally I believe the conference\r\nis assured, and I expect that it will take place in the first half of\r\nnext March. It would be desirable that the conference should take\r\nplace sooner--and the uncertainty concerning it be ended. But before\r\nthe powers join in a conference, they naturally desire an exchange of\r\nopinion the one with the other; and the connections with the seat of\r\nwar are really very slow. The delay of the communications which\r\nreached us was, and still is, explained by the delay with which news\r\ncomes from the seat of war. The suspicion which has for some time been\r\nfelt in the press that this delay was intentional becomes unfounded\r\nwhen one realizes that the advance of the Russian army following\r\nJanuary 30 was in consequence of the stipulations of the armistice,\r\nand did not constitute an advantage taken of an opportune moment. The\r\nboundaries within which the Russian army is stationed today are the\r\nlines of demarcation expressly mentioned in the armistice. I do not\r\nbelieve in any intentional delay from anywhere; on the contrary, I\r\nhave confidence in the good intentions everywhere to send\r\nrepresentatives to the conference speedily. We certainly shall do our\r\npart to the best of our ability.\r\n\r\nI now come to the most difficult part--excuse me if I continue for the\r\npresent seated--I come to the most difficult part of the task set me,\r\nan explanation, so far as this is possible, of the position which\r\nGermany is to take in the conference. In this connection you will not\r\nexpect from me anything but general indications of our policy. Its\r\nprogramme Mr. von Bennigsen has developed before you clearly and\r\ncomprehensively, almost more so than nay strength at the present\r\nmoment permits me to do.\r\n\r\nWhen from many quarters the demand has been made upon us--to be sure\r\nfrom no government, but only from voices in the press and other well\r\nmeaning advisers--that e should define our policy from the start and\r\nforce it on the other governments in some form, I must say that this\r\nseems to me to be newspaper diplomacy rather than the diplomacy of a\r\nstatesman.\r\n\r\nLet me explain to you at once the difficulty and impossibility of such\r\na course. If we did express a definite programme, which we should be\r\nobliged to follow when we had announced it officially and openly not\r\nonly before you, but also before the whole of Europe, should we not\r\nthen place a premium on the contentiousness of all those who\r\nconsidered our programme to be not favorable to themselves!\r\n\r\nWe should also render the part of mediation in the conference, which I\r\ndeem very important, almost impossible for ourselves, because\r\neverybody with the _menu_ of the German policy in his hand could say\r\nto us: \"German mediation can go just so far; it can do this, and this\r\nit cannot do.\" It is quite possible that the free hand which Germany\r\nhas preserved, and the uncertainty of Germany's decisions have not\r\nbeen without influence on the preservation of peace thus far. If you\r\nplay the German card, laying it on the table, everybody knows how to\r\nadapt himself to it or how to avoid it. Such a course is impracticable\r\nif you wish to preserve peace. The adjustment of peace does not, I\r\nbelieve, consist in our playing the arbiter, saying: \"It must be thus,\r\nand the weight of the German empire stands behind it.\" Peace is\r\nbrought about, I think, more modestly. Without straining the simile\r\nwhich I am quoting from our everyday life, it partakes more of the\r\nbehavior of the honest broker, who really wishes to bring about a\r\nbargain.\r\n\r\nAs long as we follow this policy we are in the position to save a\r\npower which has secret wishes from the embarrassment of meeting with a\r\nrefusal or an unpleasant reply from its--let me say, congressional\r\nopponent. If we are equally friendly with both, we can first sound one\r\nand then say to the other: \"Do not do that, try to arrange matters in\r\nthis way.\" These are helps in business which should be highly\r\nesteemed. I have an experience of many years in such matters, and it\r\nhas been brought home to me often, that when two are alone the thread\r\ndrops more frequently and is not picked up because of false shame. The\r\nmoment when it could be picked up passes, people separate in silence,\r\nand are annoyed. If, however, a third person is present, he can pick\r\nup the thread without much ado, and bring the two together again when\r\nthey have parted. This is the function of which I am thinking and\r\nwhich corresponds to the amicable relations in which we are living\r\nwith our friendly neighbors along our extensive borders. It is\r\nmoreover in keeping with the union among the three imperial courts\r\nwhich has existed for five years, and the intimacy which we enjoy with\r\nEngland, another one of the powers chiefly concerned in this matter.\r\nAs regards England we are in the fortunate position of not having any\r\nconflicting interests, except perhaps some trade rivalries or passing\r\nannoyances. These latter cannot be avoided, but there is absolutely\r\nnothing which could drive two industrious and peace-loving nations to\r\nwar. I happily believe, therefore, that we may be the mediator between\r\nEngland and Russia, just as I know we are between Austria and Russia,\r\nif they should not be able to agree of their own accord.\r\n\r\nThe three-emperor-pact, if one wishes to call it such, while it is\r\ngenerally called a treaty, is not based on any written obligations,\r\nand no one of the three emperors can be voted down by the other two.\r\nIt is based on the personal sympathy among the three rulers, on the\r\npersonal confidence which they have in one another, and on the\r\npersonal relations which for many years have existed among the leading\r\nministers of all three empires.\r\n\r\nWe have always avoided forming a majority of two against one when\r\nthere was a difference of opinion between Austria and Russia, and we\r\nhave never definitely taken the part of one of them, even if our own\r\ndesires drew us more strongly in that direction. We have refrained\r\nfrom this for fear that the tie might not be sufficiently strong\r\nafter all. It surely cannot be so strong that it could induce one of\r\nthese great powers to disregard its own incontestably national\r\ninterests for the sake of being obliging. That is a sacrifice which no\r\ngreat power makes _pour les beaux yeux_ of another. Such a sacrifice\r\nit makes only when arguments are replaced by hints of strength. Then\r\nit may happen that the great power will say: \"I hate to make this\r\nconcession, but I hate even worse to go to war with so strong a power\r\nas Germany. Still I will remember this and make a note of it.\" That is\r\nabout the way in which such things are received. And this leads me to\r\nthe necessity of vigorously opposing all exaggerated demands made on\r\nGermany's mediation. Let me declare that they are out of the question\r\nso long as I have the honor of being the adviser of His Majesty.\r\n\r\nI know that in saying this I am disappointing a great many\r\nexpectations raised in connection with today's disclosures, but I am\r\nnot of the opinion that we should go the road of Napoleon and try to\r\nbe, if not the arbiter, at least the schoolmaster of Europe.\r\n\r\nI have here a clipping given me today from the _Allgemeine Zeitung,_\r\nwhich contains a noteworthy article entitled \"The Policy of Germany in\r\nthe Decisive Hour.\" This article demands as necessary the admission of\r\na third power to the alliance of England and Austria. That means, we\r\nshall take part with England and Austria and deprive Russia of the\r\ncredit of voluntarily making the concessions which she may be willing\r\nto grant in the interest of European peace. I do not doubt that Russia\r\nwill sacrifice for the sake of peace in Europe whatever her sense of\r\nnationality and her own interests and those of eighty million Russians\r\npermit. It is really superfluous to say this. And now please assume\r\nthat we took the advice of the gentlemen who think that we should play\r\nthe part of an arbiter--I have here another article from a Berlin\r\npaper, called \"Germany's Part as Arbiter\"--and that we declared to\r\nRussia in some polite and amicable way: \"We have been friends, it is\r\ntrue, for hundreds of years, Russia has ever been true-blue to us when\r\nwe were in difficulties, but now things are different. In the\r\ninterest of Europe, as the policemen of Europe, as a kind of a justice\r\nof the peace, we must do as we are requested, we can no longer resist\r\nthe demands of Europe ...,\" what would be the result?\r\n\r\nThere are considerable numbers of Russians who do not love Germany,\r\nand who fortunately are not at the helm now, but who would not be\r\nunhappy if they were called there. What would they say to their\r\ncompatriots, they and perhaps other statesmen who at present are not\r\nyet avowedly hostile to us? They would say: \"With what sacrifices of\r\nblood and men and money have we not won the position which for\r\ncenturies has been the ideal of Russian ambition! We could have\r\nmaintained it against those opponents who may have a real interest in\r\ncombating it. It was not Austria, with whom we have lived on\r\nmoderately intimate terms for some time, it was not England, who\r\npossesses openly acknowledged counter-interests to ours--no, it was\r\nour intimate friend Germany who drew, behind our back, not her sword\r\nbut a dagger, although we might have expected from her services in\r\nreturn for services rendered, and although she has _no_ interests in\r\nthe Orient.\"\r\n\r\nThose approximately would be the phrases, and this the theme which we\r\nshould hear in Russia. This picture which I have drawn in exaggerated\r\nlines--but the Russian orators also exaggerate--corresponds with the\r\ntruth. We, however, shall never assume the responsibility of\r\nsacrificing the certain friendship of a great nation, tested through\r\ngenerations, to the momentary temptation of playing the judge in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nTo jeopardize the friendship which fortunately binds us to most\r\nEuropean states and at the present moment to all,--for the parties to\r\nwhom it is an eyesore are not in power,--to jeopardize, I say, this\r\nfriendship with one friend in order to oblige another, when we as\r\nGermans have no direct interests, and to buy the peace of others at\r\nthe cost of our own, or, to speak with college boys, to substitute at\r\na duel--such things one may do when one risks only one's own life, but\r\nI cannot do them when I have to counsel His Majesty the Emperor as\r\nregards the policy of a great State of forty million people in the\r\nheart of Europe. From this tribune I therefore take the liberty of\r\nsaying a very definite \"No\" to all such imputations and suggestions. I\r\nshall under no condition do anything of the kind; and no government,\r\nnone of those primarily interested, has made any such demands.\r\nGermany, as the last speaker remarked, has grown to new\r\nresponsibilities as it has grown stronger. But even if we are able to\r\nthrow a large armed force into the scales of European policies, I do\r\nnot consider anybody justified in advising the emperor and the princes\r\n(who would have to discuss the matter in the Bundesrat if we wished to\r\nwage an offensive war) to make an appeal to the proven readiness of\r\nthe nation to offer blood and money for a war. The only war which I am\r\nready to counsel to the emperor is one to protect our independence\r\nabroad and our union at home, or to defend those of our interests\r\nwhich are so clear that we are supported, if we insist on them, not\r\nonly by the unanimous vote of the Bundesrat, which is necessary, but\r\nalso by the undivided enthusiasm of the whole German nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSALUS PUBLICA--BISMARCK'S ONLY LODE-STAR\r\n\r\nFebruary 24, 1881\r\n\r\nTRANSLATED BY EDMUND VON MACH, PH.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n[On February 24, 1881, the budget of the empire for the ensuing year\r\nwas under discussion. The representative, Mr. Richter, made use of\r\nthis opportunity to attack the home-politics of the chancellor in\r\ntheir entirety. He felt great concern about the growing power of the\r\nchancellor, and called upon his liberal colleagues to stem the tide,\r\nand to curb the power of the chancellor. \"Only if this is done will\r\nthe great gifts which distinguish the chancellor continue to be\r\nfruitful for Germany. If this is not possible, and if we go on as we\r\nhave been going, the chancellor will ruin himself, and he will ruin\r\nthe country.\" Prince Bismarck replied:]\r\n\r\nThe remarks of the previous speaker have hardly touched on the subject\r\nunder discussion, the budget, since I have been here. Consequently I\r\nam excused, I suppose, from adding anything to what the secretary of\r\nthe treasury has said. The previous speaker has mainly concerned\r\nhimself with a critique of my personality. The number of times the\r\nword \"chancellor\" appears in his speech in proportion to the total\r\nnumber of words sufficiently justifies my assertion. Well, I do not\r\nknow what is the use of this critique, if not to instruct me and to\r\neducate me. But I am in my sixty-sixth year and in the twentieth of my\r\ntenure of office--there will not be much in me to improve. You will\r\nhave to use me up as I am or push me aside. I, on my part, have never\r\nmade the attempt to educate the Honorable Mr. Richter--I do not think\r\nI am called upon to do it; nor have I endeavored to force him from his\r\nsphere of activity--I should not have the means of doing this, nor do\r\nI wish it. But I believe he in his turn will lack the means of forcing\r\nme from my position. Whether he will be able to compress me and\r\ncircumscribe me, as toward the end of his speech he said was\r\ndesirable, I do not know. I am, however, truly grateful to him for the\r\nconcern he expressed about my health. Unfortunately, if I wish to do\r\nmy duty, I cannot take such care of myself as Mr. Richter deems\r\ndesirable--I shall have to risk my health.\r\n\r\nWhen he said that every evil troubling us, even the rate of interest\r\nand I know not what else, was based on the uncertainty of our\r\nconditions, and when he quoted the word of a colleague of a \"hopeless\r\nconfusion\"--well, gentlemen, then I must repeat what I have said\r\nelsewhere and in the hearing of the Honorable Mr. Richter: Make a\r\ncomparison and look about you in other countries! If our conditions\r\nwith their ordered activities and their assured future at home and\r\nabroad constitute a \"hopeless confusion,\" how shall we characterize\r\nthe conditions of many another country? I can see in no European\r\ncountry a condition of safety and an assured outlook into the future\r\nsimilar to that prevailing in the German empire. I have already said\r\non the former occasion that my position as minister of foreign affairs\r\nmade it impossible for me to be specific. But everyone who will follow\r\nmy remarks with a map in his hand, and a knowledge of history during\r\nthe past twenty years, will have to say that I am right. I do not know\r\nwhat is the use of these exaggerations of a \"hopeless confusion\" and\r\n\"a lack of assurance and uncertainty of the future.\" Nobody in the\r\ncountry believes it; and isn't that the chief thing? The people in the\r\ncountry know perfectly well how they are off, and all who do not fare\r\nas they wish are pleased to blame the government for it. When a\r\ncandidate comes up for election, and says to them: \"The government--or\r\nto quote the previous speaker--the chancellor is to blame for all\r\nthis,\" he may find many credulous people, but in the majority he will\r\nfind people who will say: \"The chancellor surely has his faults and\r\ndrawbacks\"--but most people will not be convinced that I am to blame\r\nfor everything. I am faring in this respect like Emperor Napoleon\r\ntwelve years and more ago, who was accused, not in his own country\r\nbut in Europe, as the cause of all evils, from Tartary to Spain, and\r\nhe was not nearly so bad a creature as he was said to be--may I not\r\nalso claim the benefit of this doubt with Mr. Richter? I, too, am not\r\nso bad as I am painted. His attack upon me, moreover, if he will stop\r\nto reflect, is largely directed not against me personally, or against\r\nthat part of my activities in which I possess freedom of action,\r\nno--it is directed primarily against the constitution of the German\r\nempire. The constitution of the German empire knows no other\r\nresponsible officer but the chancellor. I might assert that my\r\nconstitutional responsibility does not go nearly so far as the one\r\nactually placed upon me; and I might take things a little easier and\r\nsay: \"I have nothing to do with the home policies of the empire, for I\r\nam only the emperor's executive officer.\" But I will not do this. From\r\nthe beginning I have assumed the responsibility, and also the\r\nobligation, of defending the decisions of the Bundesrat, provided I\r\ncan reconcile them with my responsibility, even if I find myself there\r\nin the minority. This responsibility I will take as public opinion\r\nunderstands it. Nobody, however, can be held responsible for acts and\r\nresolves not his own. No responsibility can be foisted on anybody--nor\r\ndid the imperial constitution intend to do this--for acts which do not\r\ndepend on his own free will, and into which he can be forced. The\r\nresponsible person, therefore, must enjoy complete independence and\r\nfreedom within the sphere of his responsibility. If he does not, all\r\nresponsibility ceases; and _I_ do not know on whose shoulders it will\r\nrest--so far as the empire is concerned it has disappeared completely.\r\n\r\nAs long, therefore, as Mr. Richter does not change the constitution,\r\nyou yourselves must insist on having a chancellor who is absolutely\r\nfree and independent in his decisions, for no man can hold him\r\nresponsible for those things which he is unable to decide for himself,\r\nfreely and independently. Mr. Richter has expressed the wish of\r\nlimiting in several directions this constitutional independence of the\r\nchancellor. In the first place, in one direction where it is already\r\nlimited and where he wishes to have it disappear entirely. This\r\nconcerns his responsibility for those acts in our political life which\r\nthe constitution assigns to the emperor in connection with the\r\ndecisions of the Bundesrat and the Reichstag. There can be no doubt\r\nthat these acts include also those which have to be performed, as the\r\nconstitution says, in the name of the emperor; the submission, for\r\ninstance, to the Reichstag of a resolve of the Bundesrat. Mr. Richter\r\nhas correctly quoted an incident, mentioned in the _North German\r\nGazette_, concerning the resolves on some collected cases of\r\naccidents, which I considered it incompatible with my responsibility\r\nto submit to you in the name of the emperor. I, therefore, did not do\r\nit. One may well ask: What has the constitutional law to say on this\r\npoint? Was I justified in not acting? Was the emperor justified in not\r\nacting! Or was His Majesty the Emperor bound by the constitution to\r\nsubmit to you the resolve of the Bundesrat?\r\n\r\nAt the time when the constitution was being drawn I once discussed\r\nthis point with an astute jurist, who had long been and still is with\r\nus in an important position--Mr. Pape. He said to me: \"The emperor has\r\nno veto.\" I replied, \"Constitutionally he has not, but suppose a\r\nmeasure is expected of him which he thinks he should not take, and\r\nagainst which his then chancellor warns him, saying: I cannot advocate\r\nit, and I shall not countersign it. Well, in this case is the emperor\r\nobliged to look for another chancellor, and to dismiss him who opposes\r\nthe measure? Is he obliged to accept anyone as chancellor, suggested\r\nperhaps by the other party? Will he look for a second or third\r\nchancellor, both of whom may say: We cannot assume the responsibility\r\nfor this bill by submitting it to the Reichstag?\" Hereupon Mr. Pape\r\nreplied: \"You are right, the emperor possesses an indirect but actual\r\nveto.\"\r\n\r\nI do not even go so far, for none of these cases are pressed to their\r\nlogical conclusion. Let us, however, take a concrete case, which will\r\nmake these matters perfectly clear. Suppose the majority of the\r\nBundesrat had passed a bill with the approval of Prussia, but Prussia\r\nhad made the mistake of not calling upon the Prussian minister\r\ndesignated to instruct the Prussian delegation in the Bundesrat; or\r\neven--Prussia had consented and the minister had been present, and had\r\nbeen in the minority also in the Prussian cabinet, and the emperor had\r\ndirected him to submit the resolves of the Bundesrat to the Reichstag,\r\nto which the chancellor had replied: \"I do not believe that I can\r\nanswer for this, or that my responsibility permits me to do it.\" Then\r\nthere results the possibility of the emperor's saying: \"If that is so,\r\nI must look for another chancellor.\" This did not happen; another\r\nthing happened, namely--the resolve was not submitted. The ensuing\r\nsituation is this, that the persons entitled to complain--if there are\r\nany--constitute the majority of the governments who passed this\r\nresolve in the Bundesrat.\r\n\r\nThis points the proper way, and I believe in weighty questions it\r\nwould be taken to the end. In the present case if one were to make a\r\ntest of what is really right, the majority of the Bundesrat would have\r\nto represent to His Majesty as follows: \"We have passed a resolve, and\r\nour constitutional right demands that the emperor submit it to the\r\nReichstag. We demand that this be done.\" The emperor might reply: \"I\r\nwill not investigate the law of the case to see whether I am obliged\r\nto act. I will assume that I am, and I do not refuse to act, but for\r\nthe present I have no chancellor willing to countersign the order.\" In\r\nsuch a case can the chancellor be ordered to sign, because he shall\r\nand must do so? Can he be threatened with imprisonment as is done with\r\nrecalcitrant witnesses? What would then become of his responsibility!\r\nIf the chancellor continues to refuse, the majority of the Bundesrat\r\nmay say to the emperor: \"You must dismiss this chancellor and get\r\nanother. We insist that our resolve be laid before the Reichstag. If\r\nthis is not done, the constitution will be broken.\" Well, gentlemen,\r\nwhy not wait and see whether this will happen, and whether those\r\nentitled to complain will take this course, and if they do, whether\r\nHis Majesty the Emperor will not be ready to say after all: \"All\r\nright, I shall try to find a chancellor who is willing to submit the\r\nresolve.\"\r\n\r\nI shall, of course, not enter here upon a discussion of the reasons\r\nwhich determined me in this concrete case. They were reasons not found\r\nin shut-in offices, but in God's open country, and they induced me to\r\ndeem the enactment of this law undesirable. I did not possess the\r\ncertainty that a majority of this house would have seen the\r\nimpossibility of carrying out the law, but I did not wish to expose\r\nthe country to the danger--it was a danger according to my way of\r\nthinking--of getting this law. The only moment when I could guard\r\nagainst this danger was when the law was to be submitted in the name\r\nof the emperor. The constitutional remedy against such a use of an\r\nopportunity is a change of chancellors. I can see no other remedy.\r\n\r\nMentioning the Reichstag brings me to my coöperation with it. Mr.\r\nRichter's ideal is, it seems to me, a bashful, cautious chancellor who\r\nthrows out careful feelers whether he may offend here, if he does\r\nthis, or offend there--one who does not wait for a final vote of the\r\nReichstag, but rushes home excitedly, as I have often seen my\r\ncolleagues do, exclaiming: \"Oh God, the law is lost, this man and that\r\nman are opposed to it\"--and three weeks later the law has Passed in\r\nspite of them. I cannot enter upon such a policy of conjecture and\r\nproof by inference of what may be determined in the Reichstag when the\r\ntendency of those who talk the loudest, but who are not always the\r\nmost influential, happens to be against a bill; and if Mr. Richter\r\nshould succeed in procuring such a timid chancellor anxiously listening\r\nfor every hint, my advice to you, gentlemen, is to tolerate him in\r\nthis position as briefly as possible. For if a leading minister--and\r\nsuch he is in the empire--has no opinion his own, and must hear from\r\nothers what he should believe and do, then you do not need him at\r\nall. What Mr. Richter proposes is the government of the State by the\r\nReichstag, the government of the State by itself, as it has been\r\ncalled in France, by its own chosen representatives. A chancellor, a\r\nminister who does not dare to submit a bill of the ultimate success of\r\nwhich he is not absolutely sure is no minister. He might as well move\r\namong you with the white sign (of a page) inquiring whether you will\r\npermit him to submit this or that. For such a part I am not made!\r\n\r\nTo what extent I am ready to submit to the Bundesrat I have already\r\ntried to explain, and I have closed with these words \"_sub judice lis\r\nest_\" (the case is still in court). I need not say now whether my\r\nconstitutional conviction would make me yield to the majority of the\r\nBundesrat, if they should demand it. This question has not yet arisen;\r\nthe majority has not demanded it. Whether I shall maintain my\r\nopposition, if the demand is pressed, to this question I reply: _non\r\nliquet_ (it is a moot-point); we shall see what happens. Such things\r\nare eventually decided by the old law which the Romans were astonished\r\nto find with the Germans, and of which they said, \"They call it\r\nusage.\" Such a usage has not yet developed in connection with the\r\ninterpretation of our constitution.\r\n\r\nFinally, Mr. Richter has found in me too much independence in a third\r\ndirection. He has been pleased to believe--if I understood him\r\ncorrectly--that the law concerning ministerial deputies would give me\r\nthe welcome opportunity of withdrawing to a more ornamental position,\r\nto use his own expression, and to leave the duties and activities to\r\nthose who are deputed to represent me, establishing thus also in the\r\nimperial government the famous arcanum of decisions by majorities. But\r\nhere, too, I must say that Mr. Richter will have to change the\r\nconstitution before I shall be able to subordinate myself to the\r\nhighest officials of the empire. How can I appear before you saying:\r\n\"Well, gentlemen, I am very doubtful whether I can advocate this\r\nmeasure, but the secretary in whose bureau it was worked out thinks\r\nso, and following Mr. Richter's advice I have yielded to his\r\nauthority. If you do not adopt this measure you will gratify me, but\r\nnot the secretary?\" This, too, would be an altogether impossible\r\nposition, although Mr. Richter is expecting it of me.\r\n\r\nThe chiefs of the bureaus are not responsible for me, except in so far\r\nas the law of deputies substitutes them for me but I am responsible\r\nfor their actions. I have to guarantee that they are statesmen in\r\ngeneral accord with the policy of the empire which I am willing to\r\nadvocate. If I miss this accord in one of them, not once but\r\ncontinually and on principle, then it is my duty to tell him: \"We\r\ncannot remain in office, both of us.\" This, too, is a task which I\r\nhave never shirked when it has presented itself. It is simply my duty.\r\nI have never had need of such artful machinations and pyrotechnics as\r\npeople claimed I instituted very wilfully last week. You need not\r\nthink that ministers stick to their posts like many other high\r\nofficials, whom not even the broadest hints can convince that their\r\ntime has come. I have not yet found a minister in these days who had\r\nnot to be persuaded every now and then to continue a little longer in\r\noffice, and not to be discouraged by his hard and exhausting labor,\r\ndue to the simultaneous friction with three parliamentary bodies--a\r\nHouse of Representatives, a House of Lords, and a Reichstag--where one\r\nrelieves another, or two, without waiting to be relieved, are in\r\nsession at the same time. And when the fight is over and the\r\nrepresentatives have returned home well satisfied, then a bureau chief\r\ncomes to the minister on the day after, saying: \"It is time now to get\r\nthe recommendations for the next session into shape.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole business, moreover, while very honorable, is scarcely\r\npleasurable. Is any one obliged to submit to such public, sharp and\r\nimpolite criticisms as a German minister? Is it true of anyone but him\r\nthat the behavior customary among people of culture does not prevail\r\nwhen he addressed? Without the least scruple one says things to him\r\npublicly which one would be ashamed to say to him privately, if one\r\nwere to meet him in a drawing-room, for instance. I should not say\r\nthis here if the Reichstag did not hold an exceptional position in\r\nGermany in these matters as well as in everything else. Here I have\r\nnever had to hear, so far as I remember, as sharp remarks as in other\r\nassemblies. At any rate I have a conciliatory memory. But on the whole\r\nyou will agree with me that the tone of our public debates is less\r\nelevated than that of our social gatherings, especially when our\r\nministers are addressed, but at times even among fellow members,\r\nalthough of this I am no competent critic. I do not even criticize the\r\nbehavior toward the ministers, for I am hardened by an experience of\r\nmany years and can stand it. I am merely describing the reasons why no\r\nminister clings to his post, and why you do me an injustice if you\r\nbelieve that it takes an artful effort to make a minister yield his\r\nplace. Not many of them have been accustomed to see a totally ignorant\r\ncorrespondent tear an experienced minister to pieces in the press as\r\nif he were a stupid schoolboy. We see this in every newspaper every\r\nday, but we can stand it. We do not complain. But can anyone say that\r\nthe members of the government--the bureau chiefs frequently fare even\r\nworse--meet in the parliamentary debates with that urbaneness of\r\ndemeanor which characterizes our best society? I do not say \"no,\"\r\nleaving it to you to answer this question. I only say that the\r\nbusiness of being a minister is very arduous and cheerless, subject to\r\nvexations and decidedly exhausting. This brings it about that the\r\nministers are habitually in a mood which makes them readily give up\r\ntheir places as soon as they have found another excuse than the\r\nsimple: I have had enough, I do not care for more, I am tired of it.\r\n\r\nThe changes of ministers, however, have not been so many nor so quick\r\nwith us as they are in other countries, and this I may mention to Mr.\r\nRichter as a proof of my amiability as a colleague. Count, if you\r\nwill, the number of ministers who have crossed the public stage since\r\nI entered office in 1862, and sum up the resignations due to other\r\nthan parliamentary reasons, and you will find a result exceedingly\r\nfavorable to the accommodating spirit of the German minister when it\r\nis compared with that of any other country. I consider, therefore, the\r\ninsinuating references to my quarrelsome disposition and fickleness\r\ndistinctly wide of the mark.\r\n\r\nIn this connection I shall take the liberty of referring with one more\r\nword to the reproaches, often occurring in the press and also in the\r\nReichstag, that I had frequently and abruptly changed my views. Well,\r\nI am not one of those who at any time of their life have believed, or\r\nbelieve today, that they can learn no more. If a man says to me:\r\n\"Twenty years ago you held the same opinion as I; I still hold it, but\r\nyou have changed your views,\" I reply: \"You see, I was as clever\r\ntwenty years ago as you are today. Today I know more, I have learned\r\nthings in these twenty years.\" But, gentlemen, I will not even rely on\r\nthe justice of the remark that the man who does not learn also fails\r\nto progress and cannot keep abreast of his time. People are falling\r\nbehind when they remain rooted in the position they occupied years\r\nago. However, I do not at all intend to excuse myself with such\r\nobservations, for _I have always had one compass only, one lode-star\r\nby which I have steered: Salus Publica, the welfare of the State_.\r\nPossibly I have often acted rashly and hastily since I first began my\r\ncareer, but whenever I had time to think I have always acted according\r\nto the question, \"What is useful, advantageous, and right for my\r\nfatherland, and--as long as this was only Prussia--for my dynasty, and\r\ntoday--for the German nation?\" I have never been a theorist. The\r\nsystems which bin and separate parties are for me of secondary\r\nimportance. The nation comes first, its position in the world and its\r\nindependence, and above all our organization along lines inch will\r\nmake it possible for us to draw the free breath of a great nation.\r\n\r\nEverything else, a liberal, reactionary, or conservative\r\nconstitution--gentlemen, I freely confess, all this I consider in\r\nsecond place. It is the luxury of furnishing the house, when the house\r\nis firmly established. In the interest of the country I can parley now\r\nwith one person, now with another in purely party questions. Theories\r\nI barter away cheaply. First let us build a structure secure on the\r\noutside and firmly knit on the inside, and protected by the ties of a\r\nnational union. After that, when you ask my advice about furnishing\r\nthe house with more or less liberal constitutional fittings, you may\r\nperhaps hear me say, \"Ah well, I have no preconceived ideas. Make your\r\nsuggestions, and, when the sovereign whom I serve agrees, you will\r\nfind no objections on principle on my part.\" It can be done thus, and\r\nagain thus. There are many roads leading to Rome. There are times\r\nwhen one should govern liberally, and times when one should govern\r\nautocratically. Everything changes. Nothing is eternal in these\r\nmatters. But of the structure of the German empire and the union of\r\nthe German nation I demand that they be free and unassailable, with\r\nnot only a passing field fortification on one side. I have given to\r\nits creation and growth my entire strength from the very beginning.\r\nAnd if you point to a single moment when I have not steered by this\r\ndirection of the compass-needle, you may perhaps prove that I have\r\nerred, but you cannot prove that I have for one moment lost sight of\r\nthe national goal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRINCE BISMARCK FRANZ VON LENBACH]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL CHRISTIANITY\r\n\r\nApril 2, 1881\r\n\r\nTRANSLATED BY EDMUND VON MACH, PH.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Prince Bismarck was trying to fight the revolutionary parties, not\r\nonly with such restrictive laws as had been passed against the\r\nSocialists, but also with constructive measures like the one which had\r\nbeen submitted to the Reichstag on March 8, 1881. It proposed the\r\ninsurance of the workingman against accidents, and the founding of a\r\ngovernmental insurance company. The bill was severely criticized,\r\nnotably by Eugen Richter, who did not miss the opportunity of\r\nattacking also the chancellor personally. Prince Bismarck's reply made\r\na deep impression in the country at large. The bill itself, however,\r\nwas so badly amended in the Reichstag, that Bismarck urged the\r\nBundesrat to reject it, which it did. Several changes, thereupon, were\r\nmade in the bill, and, after having been delayed in committee, it was\r\nagain brought up for discussion in 1884, when another exhaustive\r\nspeech by the chancellor, on March 15, brought about its acceptance.]\r\n\r\nBefore turning to the subject in hand, I wish to reply to some remarks\r\nof the previous speaker, lest I forget them--they are of so little\r\nweight. He finished by saying that my prestige was waning. If he were\r\nright, I should feel like saying \"Thank God,\" for prestige is a very\r\nburdensome affair. One suffers under its weight, and quickly gets\r\ntired of it. I do not care a farthing for it. When I was very much\r\nyounger, about as old as the previous speaker is now, and when I was\r\npossibly still more ambitious than he, I lived for years without\r\nprestige, and was actually disliked, if not hated, by the majority of\r\nmy fellow-citizens. At that time I felt better and more contented, and\r\nwas healthier than during the years when I was most popular.\r\n\r\nSuch things do not mean much to me. I am doing my duty, let come what\r\nmay.\r\n\r\nAs proof of his assertion the previous speaker claimed that the\r\nworkingmen are refusing the help which the Imperial Government is\r\ntrying to offer them. This he cannot possibly know. He has no idea of\r\nwhat the great mass of the workingmen are thinking. Probably he has\r\nsome accurate information of what the eloquent place-hunters are\r\nthinking of the bill, people who are at the head of the labor\r\nmovements, and the professional publicists, who need a following of\r\nworkingmen--dissatisfied workingmen. But as to the workingman in\r\ngeneral, we had better wait and see what he is thinking. I do not know\r\nwhether the full meaning of this question has even yet sufficiently\r\npenetrated into his circles to make it a subject of discussion, except\r\nin the learned clubs of laborers, and among the leading place-hunters\r\nand speakers. In the next election we shall be able to tell whether\r\nthe workingmen have formed their opinion of the bill by then, not to\r\nspeak of now.\r\n\r\nThe legislation on which we are entering with this bill has to do with\r\na question which will probably stay on your calendar for a long while.\r\nThe previous speaker has correctly said that \"it opens up a very deep\r\nperspective,\" and it is not at all impossible that it may also make\r\nthe moderate Socialists judge more kindly of the government. We have\r\nbeen talking of a social question for fifty years; and, since the\r\npassage of the law against the Socialists, I have been constantly\r\nreminded, officially, from high quarters, and by the people, that we\r\ngave a promise at that time. Something positive should be done to\r\nremove the causes for Socialism, in so far as they are legitimate. _I_\r\nhave received such reminders daily. Nor do I believe that this social\r\nquestion, which has been before us for fifty years now, will be\r\ndefinitely settled even by our children and children's children. No\r\npolitical question ever reaches so complete a mathematical solution\r\nthat the books can be balanced. Such questions arise, abide a while\r\nand finally give way to other historical problems. This is the way of\r\norganic developments.\r\n\r\nI deem it my duty to take up this question quietly and without party\r\nvehemence, because I do not know who else could do this successfully\r\nif not the Imperial Government. It is a pity that party questions\r\nshould be mixed up in it. The previous speaker has referred to a\r\nsupposedly active exchange of telegrams between \"certain parties\" and\r\n\"an high official,\" which in this case, I must believe, means me. I am\r\nmentioning this, in passing, because he said the same thing a few days\r\nago in another speech. Gentlemen, this is a very simple matter. I\r\nreceive thousands of telegrams; and, being a polite man, I should\r\nprobably reply also to a telegram from Mr. Richter, if he were to\r\nhonor me with a friendly despatch. When I am cordially addressed in a\r\nmessage, I have to reply in cordial terms. I cannot possibly have the\r\npolice ascertain to what party the senders belong. Nor am I so\r\ndiffident in my views that I should wish to catechize the senders as\r\nto their political affiliations. If anybody takes pleasure in making\r\nme appear to be a member of anti-semitic societies, let him do so. I\r\nhave kept away from all undesirable movements, as my position demands,\r\nand I could wish that also you gentlemen would refrain more than\r\nheretofore from inciting the classes against each other, and from\r\noratorical phrases which fan class-hatred. This refers especially to\r\nthose gentlemen who have bestowed their kind attention upon the\r\nGovernment and upon me personally. When we heard the representative,\r\nMr. Lasker, say the other day that the policy of the government was\r\naristocratic, this term was bound to render the whole aristocracy and\r\nwhat belongs to it suspected of selfishness in the eyes of the poor\r\nmen, at whose expense the aristocracy seemingly exists. When such\r\nexpressions fall on anti-semitic ground, how is it possible to avoid\r\nreprisals? The anti-semites will coin their own word with which to\r\ndesignate--as they think appropriately--the policies opposed to ours.\r\nThe resulting epithet I do not care to mention; every one will think\r\nof it himself. When afterwards a newspaper like the _Tribune_, which\r\nis said to be owned by Mr. Bamberger, makes itself the mouthpiece of\r\nMr. Lasker's expression, claiming it to be correct, and hailing the\r\ninvention of this word as a discovery worthy of Columbus, and when the\r\n_Tribune_ finally asserts that \"care for the poor\" and \"aristocracy\"\r\ncannot exist in the same train of thought, can you not imagine what\r\nwill happen when all this is turned around, and altered by an\r\nanti-semite? Are you in doubt what he will substitute for\r\n\"aristocracy,\" and do you not know that he will repeat every twist and\r\nturn of speech with which Mr. Bamberger's sheet imputes selfish\r\ninjustice to the aristocracy?\r\n\r\nThe representative Mr. Richter has called attention to the\r\nresponsibility of the State for everything it does in the field on\r\nwhich it is entering today. Well, gentlemen, I feel that the State may\r\nbecome responsible also for the things it does _not_ do. I do not\r\nbelieve that the \"_laissez faire, laissez aller_, theory,\" and the\r\nunadulterated political theories of Manchester, such as \"let each one\r\ndo what he chooses, and fare as he will,\" or \"who is not strong enough\r\nto stand, let him be crushed,\" or \"he who has will receive more, and\r\nhe who has not from him let us take,\" can be practised in any State,\r\nleast of all in a monarchical State, governed by the father of his\r\ncountry. On the contrary, I believe that those who shudder at the\r\nState exerting its influence for the protection of the weaker\r\nbrethren, themselves intend to capitalize their strength--be it\r\nfinancial, rhetorical, or what not--that they may gain a following, or\r\noppress the rest, or smooth their own way to party control. They\r\nbecome angry, of course, as soon as their plans are spoiled by the\r\nrising influence of the State.\r\n\r\nThe representative Mr. Richter says this legislation does not go far\r\nenough. If he will have patience, we may perhaps be able to satisfy\r\nhim a little later--one should not be hasty or try to do everything at\r\nonce! Such laws are not made arbitrarily out of theories and as the\r\nresult of asking \"what kind of law would it be wise to make now?\"\r\nThey are the gradual outgrowth of earlier events. The reason why we\r\ncome to you today only with an accident-insurance law is because this\r\nbranch of the care of the poor and the weak was especially vigorous\r\neven before I seriously concerned myself with such matters. Bequests,\r\nsuggestions, and notes for such a bill were on file when I assumed\r\noffice. According to the records this bill was needed more than any\r\nother. When I began to study it, I must confess that it did not seem\r\nto me to go far enough in theory, and that I was tempted to change the\r\nwords which occur, I believe in the first paragraph, \"every workingman\r\nwho\" and \"shall be reimbursed in such and such a way,\" to read, \"every\r\nGerman.\" There is something ideal in this change. If one thinks of it\r\nmore seriously, however, and especially if one plans to include also\r\nthe independent workmen, who meet with an accident at no one's behest\r\nbut their own, the question of insurance is even more difficult. No\r\ntwo hours' speech of any representative can give us so much concern as\r\nthis problem has given us: \"How far is it possible to extend this law\r\nwithout creating at the very start an unfavorable condition, or\r\nreaching out too far and thus overreaching ourselves?\" As a farmer I\r\nwas tempted to ask, whether it would be possible to extend the\r\ninsurance, for instance, also to the farmhands, who constitute the\r\nmajority of the workingmen in our eastern provinces. I shall not give\r\nup hope that this may be possible, but there are difficulties, which\r\nfor the time being have prevented us from doing this; and concerning\r\nthese I wish to say a few words.\r\n\r\nThe farming industry, in so far as it has to do with machinery and\r\nelemental forces, is, of course, not excluded from the law. But the\r\nremaining great majority of the country population also comes in\r\nfrequent contact with machines, although these are set in motion not\r\nby elemental forces, but by horses or fellow-laborers. Such\r\noccupations are often dangerous and unwholesome, but it is\r\nexceedingly difficult to gather statistics and percentages, and to\r\ndefine the necessary amount of contributions to an insurance fund.\r\nThe representative Mr. Richter knows, apparently from experience, the\r\nproper percentage in every branch of human occupation, for he has\r\nquoted his figures with much assurance. I should be grateful to him if\r\nhe would mention also the source of his valuable information. We have\r\ndone the best we could. The preliminary drafts of the bill were based\r\non carefully selected facts--notice please, selected facts, and not\r\narbitrary statistics based on conjecture. If we had discovered those\r\nfigures, which the quicker eye of the honorable Mr. Richter seems to\r\nhave detected at a glance, and if we had believed them to be accurate,\r\nwe should have gone further in this bill.\r\n\r\nWhen I say that I do not give up hope that the farming industry may\r\nyet be included, I am thinking of an organization which cannot be\r\ncreated at one session of the Reichstag. Like the child which must be\r\nsmall if it is to be born at all, and which gradually assumes its\r\nproper proportions by growth, so also this organization will have to\r\ndevelop gradually. Eventually the various branches of industry which\r\nhave insured their laborers should be formed into incorporated\r\nassociations, and each association should raise among its own members\r\nthe premiums needed for the proper insurance of its laborers. It\r\nshould at the same time exercise supervision over its members to the\r\nextent that the dues should be as low as possible. Or, to put it\r\ndifferently, the personal interest of the contributing members should\r\nsee to it that adequate means for the prevention of accidents are\r\nadopted. If this can be accomplished by a gradual advance based on\r\nexperience, we may also hope to find, by experience, the proper\r\npercentage as regards that branch of farming which does not employ\r\nelemental forces.\r\n\r\nOur lack of experience in these matters has also induced us to be very\r\ncareful about the assessment of the necessary contributions. I\r\ncertainly should not have the courage to press this bill if the\r\nexpenses which it entails were to be borne exclusively by the various\r\nindustries. If the assistance which the State would render--either by\r\nprovincial or county associations, or directly--were to be entirely\r\nomitted, I should not dare to answer to our industries for the\r\nconsequences of this law. Perhaps this can be done, and after a few\r\nyears of experience we may be able to judge whether it is possible.\r\nThe State contribution, therefore, may be limited at first to three\r\nyears, or to whatever period you wish. But without any actual\r\nexperience, without any practical test of what we are to expect, I do\r\nnot dare to burden our industries with all the expenses of this\r\ngovernment-institution, and to add to their taxes. I do not dare to\r\nplace upon them the whole burden of caring for the injured factory or\r\nmill hands. The county associations used to do this, and in the future\r\nit will be done more fully and in a more dignified way by the insurers\r\nand the State.\r\n\r\nNo entirely new charges are here contemplated; the charges are merely\r\ntransferred from the county associations to the State. I do not deny\r\nthat the tax of him who pays and the advantages which accrue to the\r\nlaborer will be increased. The increase, however, does not equal the\r\nfull third which the State is to bear, but only the difference between\r\nwhat at present the county associations are obliged to do for the\r\ninjured workingmen, and what these men will receive in future. You\r\nsee, it is purely a question of improving the lot of the laboring man.\r\nThis difference, therefore, is the only new charge on the State, with\r\nwhich you have to reckon. And you will have to ask yourselves: \"Is the\r\nadvantage gained worth this difference,--when we aim to procure for\r\nthe laborer who has been injured a better and more adequate support,\r\nand relieve him of the necessity of having to fight for his right in\r\ncourt, and when he will receive without delay the moderate stipend\r\nwhich the State decrees?\" I feel like answering the question with a\r\nstrong affirmative.\r\n\r\nOur present poor laws keep the injured laboring man from starvation.\r\nAccording to law, at least, nobody need starve. Whether in reality\r\nthis never happens I do not know. But this is not enough in order to\r\nlet the men look contentedly into the future and to their own old age.\r\nThe present bill intends to keep the sense of human dignity alive\r\nwhich even the poorest German should enjoy, if I have my way. He\r\nshould feel that he is no mere eleemosynary, but that he possesses a\r\nfund which is his very own. No one shall have the right to dispose of\r\nit, or to take it from him, however poor he may be. This fund will\r\nopen for him many a door, which otherwise will remain closed to him\r\nand it will secure for him better treatment in the house where he has\r\nbeen received, because when he leaves he can take away with him\r\nwhatever contributions he has been making to the household expenses.\r\n\r\nIf you have ever personally investigated the conditions of the poor in\r\nour large cities, or of the village paupers in the country, you have\r\nbeen able to observe the wretched treatment which the poor\r\noccasionally receive even in the best managed communities, especially\r\nif they are physically weak or crippled. This happens in the houses of\r\ntheir stepmothers, or relatives of any kind, yes also in those of\r\ntheir nearest of kin. Knowing this, are you not obliged to confess\r\nthat every healthy laboring man, who sees such things, must say to\r\nhimself: \"Is it not terrible that a man is thus degraded in the house\r\nwhich he used to inhabit as master and that his neighbor's dog is not\r\nworse off than he?\" Such things do happen. What protection is there\r\nfor a poor cripple, who is pushed into a corner, and is not given\r\nenough to eat? There is none. But if he has as little as 100 or 200\r\nmarks of his own, the people will think twice before they oppress him.\r\nWe have been in a position to observe this in the case of the military\r\ninvalids. Although only five or six dollars are paid every month, this\r\nactual cash amounts to something in the household where the poor are\r\nboarded, and the thrifty housewife is careful not to offend or to lose\r\nthe boarder who pays cash.\r\n\r\nI, therefore, assure you that we felt the need of insisting by this\r\nlaw on a treatment of the poor which should be worthy of humanity.\r\nNext year I shall be able fully to satisfy Mr. Richter in regard to\r\nthe amount and the extent of attention which the State will give to a\r\nbetter and more adequate care of all the unemployed. This will come as\r\na natural consequence, whether or no the present bill is passed. Today\r\nthis bill is a test, as it were. We are sounding to see how deep the\r\nwaters are, financially, into which we are asking the State and the\r\ncountry to enter. You cannot guard yourselves against such problems by\r\ndelivering elegant and sonorous speeches, in which you recommend the\r\nimprovement of our laws of liability, without in the least indicating\r\nhow this can be done. In this way you cannot settle these questions,\r\nfor you are acting like the ostrich, who hides his head lest he see\r\nhis danger. The Government has seen its duty and is facing, calmly and\r\nwithout fear, the dangers which we heard described here a few days ago\r\nmost eloquently and of which we were given convincing proofs.\r\n\r\nWe should, however, also remove, as much as possible, the causes which\r\nare used to excite the people, and which alone render them susceptible\r\nto criminal doctrines. It is immaterial to me whether or no you will\r\ncall this Socialism. If you call it Socialism, you must have the\r\nremarkable wish of placing the Imperial Government, in so far as this\r\nbill of the allied governments is concerned, in the range of the very\r\ncritique which Mr. von Puttkamer passed here on the endeavors of the\r\nSocialists. It would then almost seem that with this bill only a very\r\nsmall distance separated us from the murderous band of Hasselmann, the\r\nincendiary writings of Most, and the revolutionary conspiracies of the\r\nCongress of Wyden; and that even this distance would soon disappear.\r\nWell, gentlemen, this is, of course, the very opposite of true. Those\r\nwho fight with such oratorical and meaningless niceties are counting\r\non the many meanings of the word \"socialism.\" As a result of the kind\r\nof programs which the Socialists have issued, this term is, in our\r\npublic opinion today, almost synonymous with \"criminal.\" If the\r\ngovernment endeavors to treat the injured workingmen better in the\r\nfuture, and especially more becomingly, and not to offer to their as\r\nyet vigorous brethren the spectacle, as it were, of an old man on the\r\ndump heap slowly starving to death, this cannot be called socialistic\r\nin the sense in which that murderous band was painted to us the other\r\nday. People are playing a cheap game with the shadow on the wall when\r\nthey call our endeavors socialistic.\r\n\r\nIf the representative Mr. Bamberger, who took no offense at the word\r\n\"Christian,\" wishes to give a name to our endeavors which I could\r\ncheerfully accept, let it be: \"Practical Christianity,\" but _sans\r\nphrase_, for we shall not pay the people with words and speeches, but\r\nwith actual improvements. Yet, death alone is had for the asking. If\r\nyou refuse to reach into your pocketbook, or that of the State, you\r\nwill not accomplish anything. If you should place the whole burden on\r\nthe industries, I do not know whether they could bear it. Some might\r\nbe able to do it, but not all. Those who could do it are the\r\nindustries where the wages are but a small fraction of the total cost\r\nof production. Among such I mention the chemical factories, and the\r\nmills which with twenty mill hands can do an annual business of\r\nseveral million marks. The great mass of laborers, however, does not\r\nwork in such establishments, which I am tempted to call\r\naristocratic--without wishing to excite any class-hatred. They are in\r\nindustries where the wages amount to 80 or 90 per cent, of the cost of\r\nproduction. Whether the latter can bear the additional burden I do not\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nIt is, moreover, perfectly immaterial whether the assessment is made\r\non the employer or on the employee. In either case the industry will\r\nhave to bear it, for the contribution of the laborer will\r\neventually, and of necessity, be added to the expenses of the\r\nindustry. There is a general complaint that the average wages of the\r\nlaborers make the saving of a surplus impossible. If you wish,\r\ntherefore, to add a burden to the laborers whose present wages are no\r\nmore than sufficient, the employers will have to increase the wages,\r\nor the laborers will leave them for other occupations.\r\n\r\nThe previous speaker called the bill defective, because the principle\r\nof relieving the laborer from all contributions had not been\r\nconsistently followed; and he spoke as if this principle had not been\r\nat all followed. Laborers, receiving more than 750 marks in three\r\nhundred working days, are, it is true, not affected by it; and this is\r\ndue to the origin of the bill. The first draft read that one-third of\r\nthe contributions should be made by those county associations which\r\nwould have to support the injured man in conformity with the poor-laws\r\nof the State. We did not wish merely to make a gift to these\r\nassociations, which at present are responsible for 80 per cent. of all\r\ninjured working-men, that is for those who do not come under the law\r\nof liability. We, therefore, accepted as just the proposition that\r\nthese associations should pay one-third toward the insurance of those\r\nmen who formerly would have become their charges. Laborers, however,\r\nwhose pay is large enough to keep them from becoming public charges,\r\nwhen they meet with an accident, hold an exceptional position. I am,\r\nnevertheless, perfectly willing to drop this exception in the bill, as\r\nI have said repeatedly. But since the Reichstag in its entirety has\r\nthus far placed itself on record as opposed to any contribution from\r\nthe State, I should not gain thereby any votes for the bill. I wish to\r\ndeclare, however, that this limit of 750 marks is of no consequence\r\ncompared with the theory on which the bill is based. It arose from a\r\nsense of justice toward the county associations, which were not to be\r\nburdened with higher taxes than would equal their savings under this\r\nbill. Later it was discovered from many actual examples that the\r\ninsurance according to the existing county associations was\r\nimpossible, because the State, which really is responsible for the\r\ncare of the poor, had distributed it in an arbitrary and unjust way on\r\nthe various county associations. Small and weak country communities\r\nare often overburdened with the care of poor people, while large and\r\nwealthy communities may have practically no charges, since the\r\ngeographical position alone has determined the membership in the\r\nvarious county associations. The result, therefore, of levying the\r\nnecessary contributions on these associations would have been a very\r\nuneven distribution of the assessments. Being convinced of this, I\r\nsuggested the substitution of \"provincial association\" for \"county\r\nassociation\"; and thus the bill read for several weeks, until we\r\nyielded to the wishes of the allied states and of the Economic\r\nCouncil, and left to each state the question whether it wished to take\r\nthe place of these various associations or preferred to call upon them\r\nin any way it chose. These are the steps by which we reached the 750\r\nmark exemption, and the unconditional share which is to be paid by the\r\nState. This share is nothing but a hint to the legislature how to\r\ndistribute the care of the poor to the various county--and other\r\nassociations. Whatever is done, you will agree with me that we need a\r\nrevision of our poor-laws. Just how this will eventually be\r\naccomplished is immaterial to me.\r\n\r\nI am not astonished that the most divergent views are held on this new\r\nsubject, which touches our lives very intimately, and which no\r\nexperience has as yet illuminated. Because of this divergence of\r\nopinion I am also aware that we may be unable to pass an acceptable\r\nlaw at this session. My own interest in this entire work would be very\r\nmuch lessened if I were to notice that the principle of a State\r\ncontribution were to be definitely rejected, and that the legislative\r\nassembly of the country were to vote against State-contributions. This\r\nwould transfer the whole matter to the sphere of open commerce, if I\r\nmay say so, and in that case it might be better to leave the\r\ninsurance to private enterprise rather than to establish a\r\nState-institution without any compulsion. I should certainly not have\r\nthe courage to exercise compulsion, if the State did not at the same\r\ntime make a contribution.\r\n\r\nIf compulsion is exercised, it is necessary for the law to establish a\r\ndepartment of insurance. This is cheaper and safer than any company.\r\nYou cannot expose the savings of the poor to possible insolvency, nor\r\ncan you allow any part of the contributions to be used for the payment\r\nof dividends or interest on stocks and bonds. The representative Mr.\r\nBamberger based his opposition to the bill--you remember his strong\r\nwords--largely on his sorrow at the impending ruin of the insurance\r\ncompanies. He said they would be crushed and annihilated, and he\r\nadded, that they were soliciting the gratitude of their\r\nfellow-citizens. I always thought they were soliciting the money of\r\ntheir fellow-citizens. If in addition they can get their gratitude,\r\nthey are turning a very clever trick. That they should be willing,\r\nlike good souls, to sacrifice themselves in the interest of the\r\nworkingmen, and establish their institutions of insurance without\r\nissuing any shares, I have never believed, and it would be difficult\r\nto convince me of it. According to my feeling of right and wrong, we\r\ncannot force anybody to join private insurance companies which may\r\nbecome bankrupt even under good management, owing to fluctuations in\r\nthe market, or to panics, and which have to arrange their premiums so\r\nthat dividends are realized for those who are investing their capital,\r\nor at least interest on the invested money and the hope of dividends.\r\nTo this I cannot lend my assistance. If the State is going to exercise\r\ncompulsion, it must, I believe, undertake the insurance itself. It may\r\nbe the empire for all, or the individual State--but, without this, no\r\ncompulsion!\r\n\r\nNor have I the courage, as I have already said, to exercise any\r\ncompulsion if I cannot offer something in return. This contribution of\r\na third is, as I said before, much smaller than it looks, because\r\nthe associations will be greatly relieved of the old burdens which the\r\nState had imposed on them. If this is communism, as the last speaker\r\ncalled it, and not socialism, I do not care one iota. I shall call it\r\nagain and again \"practical Christianity legally demonstrated.\" If,\r\nhowever, it is communism, then communism has been extensively\r\npractised in the districts for a long while, and actually under State\r\ncompulsion.\r\n\r\nThe previous speaker said that by our method the lower classes would\r\nbe oppressed with indirect taxes in order to collect the funds for the\r\ncare of the poor. But I ask you, gentlemen, what is being done in the\r\nlarge cities, in Berlin for instance, which the speaker thinks is\r\nsplendidly governed by the liberal ring? Here the poor man is taken\r\ncare of with the proceeds of the tax on rents, which is exacted of his\r\nslightly less poor brother; and to-morrow he may have this brother as\r\nhis companion in misery, when a warrant is executed against the latter\r\nfor the non-payment of this tax. That is more cruel than if the\r\npayment were made from the tax on tobacco or on alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe previous speaker said that I had spoken against the tax on\r\nalcohol. I really do not remember this, and I should be grateful if he\r\nwould prove this by quoting one word. I have always mentioned tobacco\r\nand alcohol as commodities on which larger taxes should be levied, but\r\nI have expressed a doubt whether it is right to tax the alcohol in\r\nfactories while it is being made. Many States, as for instance France,\r\ndo not levy any tax on alcohol, or assess it at a different time. The\r\nrepresentative, therefore, has made a mistake--no doubt\r\nunintentionally. When, however, this mistake will be printed, without\r\nrefutation, in many papers, which are under his influence, it will, I\r\nam sure, make no mean impression.\r\n\r\nI will not dilate on the defects of the law of liability, which will\r\nbe discussed by experienced men, who have had more to do with it than\r\nI. These defects, however, added their weight to the promise we made\r\nwhen the law against the Socialists was promulgated--you undoubtedly\r\nremember it and I have been reminded of it often enough--and were my\r\nchief reasons for submitting to you the present bill. Our present law\r\nof liability has shown surprisingly bad results. I have convinced\r\nmyself, by actual occurrences, that the suits arising under this law\r\noften terminate unexpectedly and unfairly, if they are successful. And\r\nif they are unsuccessful, they are frequently equally unfair. I have\r\nbeen assured by many creditable people that this law does not improve\r\nthe relations between the employer and the employees. On the contrary,\r\nthe bitter feeling between them is increased, wherever there are many\r\nsuch suits, especially where there are shyster-lawyers who like to sow\r\ndiscord with an eye to the elections. This is in strong contrast to\r\nthe good intentions of the law. The workingmen, however, consider\r\nthemselves injured by it, because not even a decree of the court will\r\nconvince them that they are wrong, especially if they have lawyers who\r\ntell them they are right, and that they should appeal their cases to\r\nfour or five higher courts, if there were as many.\r\n\r\nThese observations made me wish to introduce a system which would work\r\nsmoothly, and in which there would be no question of suits-at-law, or\r\ninvestigations into anyone's culpability. The latter is quite\r\nimmaterial for him who has been injured. He remains unfortunate,\r\ncrippled, and unable to earn a living, if this has been his lot, or,\r\nif he has been killed, his family is left without its bread-winner,\r\nwhether the accident was due to criminal neglect, carelessness, or\r\nunavoidable circumstances. These are not questions of corrective or\r\ndistributive justice, but of protection. Without a proper law a great\r\npart of our population is helpless before the hardships of life, or\r\nthe consequences of an accident. Without any capital of their own\r\nthese people have no redress against the cruelties which are the lot\r\nof the pauper who has become a public charge.\r\n\r\nI will not reply at length to the reproach that this is communism, but\r\nI should like to ask you not to discuss everything from the point\r\nof view of party-strategy, or faction-strategy, or from the feeling\r\n\"away with Bismarck.\" We have to do here with matters where not one of\r\nus can see his way clearly, and where we must search for the right\r\nroad with sticks and sounding-rods. I should like to see another man\r\nin my place as speedily as possible, if he would continue my work. I\r\nshould gladly say to him, \"Son, take up your father's spear,\" even if\r\nhe were not my own son. This undesirable way of discussing matters\r\nshowed itself the other day, when the gentlemen fought for \"the poor\r\nman,\" as if they had to do with the body of Patroclus. Mr. Lasker took\r\nhold of him at one end, and I tried to snatch him away from Mr. Lasker\r\nas best I could. But where do imputed motives, and class-hatred, and\r\nthe excitement of misery and suffering lead us? Such behavior comes\r\ntoo near being socialism in the sense in which Mr. von Puttkamer\r\nexposed it the other day.\r\n\r\nAlms constitute the first step of Christian charity, such as must\r\nexist in France, for instance, to a great extent. There are no\r\npoor-laws in France, and every poor man has the right to starve to\r\ndeath if charitable people do not prevent him from doing so. Charity\r\nis the first duty, and the second is, the assistance given by\r\ndistricts and according to law. A State, however, which is composed\r\nvery largely of Christians--even if you are horrified at hearing it\r\ncalled a Christian State,--should let itself be permeated with the\r\nprinciples which it confesses, and especially with those which have to\r\ndo with the help of our neighbors, and the sympathy one feels for the\r\nlot which threatens the old and the sick.\r\n\r\nThe extensive discussions, which I have partly heard, and partly read\r\nin the Parliamentary extracts of yesterday, compel me to make some\r\nfurther observations. The representative Mr. Richter has said that the\r\nwhole bill amounted to a subsidy of the big industries. Well, here\r\nagain, you have an instance of class-hatred, which would receive new\r\nfuel if his words were true. I do not know why you assume that the\r\nGovernment cherishes a blind and special love for the big industries.\r\nThe big manufacturers are, it is true, children of fortune, and this\r\ncreates no good will toward them among the rest of the people. But to\r\nweaken or to confine their existence would be a very foolish\r\nexperiment. If we dropped our big industries, making it impossible for\r\nthem to compete with those of other countries, and if we placed\r\nburdens on them which they have not yet been proved able to bear, we\r\nmight meet with the approval of all who are vexed at seeing anybody\r\nricher than other people, most especially than themselves. But, if we\r\nruin the big industries, what shall we do with the laborers? In such a\r\ncase we should be facing the problem, to which the representative Mr.\r\nRichter referred with much concern, of the organization of labor. If a\r\nbusiness, employing twenty thousand laborers and more, goes to pieces,\r\nand if the big industries go to pieces, because they have been\r\ndenounced to public opinion and to the legislature as dangerous and\r\nliable to heavier taxes, we could not let twenty thousand, and\r\nhundreds of thousands of laborers starve to death. In such a case we\r\nshould have to organize a genuine State-socialism, and find work for\r\nthese laborers, similar to what we have been doing during every panic.\r\n\r\nIf the objections of the representative Mr. Richter, who claimed that\r\nwe must guard ourselves against State-socialism as against some\r\ndisease, were well taken, how does it happen that we are providing\r\nwork whenever a calamity has afflicted one or another of the\r\nprovinces? Such work would not be provided, if the workingmen could\r\nfind other remunerative occupations. In such cases we build railways\r\nof doubtful productivity, and make improvements, which under ordinary\r\ncircumstances are left to the individual citizens to make. If this is\r\ncommunism, I am by no means opposed to it. But the use of such\r\ncatch-words does not advance the solution of any problem.\r\n\r\nI have already commented on Mr. Bamberger's defence of the private\r\ninsurance companies. I am, however, convinced that we are not\r\ncalled upon to espouse their cause of all others when we are\r\nconfronted by tremendous economic needs. He has also referred to the\r\n\"four weeks\" which have to elapse before the insurance takes effect.\r\nThis was done in the hope that the unions and societies would wish to\r\ndo something themselves. We are always told that the laborers deem\r\ninsurance to be contrary to their honor, unless they contribute\r\nsomething toward it. For this reason we have left the first four weeks\r\nuninsured. I am not certain on this point, but if another solution\r\nseems better, I believe that the law should cover also this hiatus.\r\nThere is no fundamental objection to this.\r\n\r\nOne single fact will throw much light on the considerable burdens of\r\nwhich the county communities will be relieved when the care of their\r\npoor will pass, according to this bill, to the community of the State.\r\nI have been unable to ascertain the number of persons to whom\r\nassistance is given in the empire or in the kingdom of Prussia, and\r\neven less to discover the amount of money spent for this purpose. In\r\nthe country, and elsewhere, private charity and public help are so\r\nintermingled that it is impossible to separate them, or to keep\r\naccurate accounts. The one hundred and seventy cities, however, which\r\nhave more than ten thousand inhabitants expend on the average four\r\nmarks per capita for the care of their poor. This item varies between\r\n0.63 mark and 12.84 marks--a great variation as you see. The most\r\nremarkable results are found where the majority of laborers are banded\r\ntogether in unions or similar associations. It would be natural to\r\nthink that places like Oberneunkirchen and Duttweiler with large\r\nfactory populations would have a very large budget for the poor; and\r\nthat Berlin, which is only in part an industrial centre, would be an\r\naverage locality, for our purposes, if its finances were well managed.\r\nAs a matter of fact it pays far more than the average for the care of\r\nits poor without doing this exceptionally well. Anyone who is\r\ninterested in private charities, and cares to visit the poor of\r\nBerlin, will be convinced of their pitiful condition.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Berlin budget for the poor amounts to 5,000,000\r\nmarks--these are the latest figures--and for the care of the sick poor\r\nto 1,900,000 marks. Why these two items should be separated I do not\r\nknow. Together, therefore, they amount to about 7,000,000 marks, or 7\r\nmarks per capita, while the average of the large cities is 4 marks. If\r\nsuch a poor-tax of 7 marks per capita were extended to the whole\r\nempire, it would yield 300,000,000 marks; and if the direct taxes of\r\nBerlin, amounting to 23 marks per capita, were levied on the empire,\r\nwe should receive more than one milliard marks in direct taxes,\r\nincluding those on rents and incomes. Fortunately not all the people\r\nof the empire are living under a liberal ring, and least of all the\r\ninhabitants of cities where the majority of the workingmen have joined\r\nunions or similar associations. We have discovered the remarkable fact\r\nthat Oberneunkirchen with its large factory population pays only 0.58\r\nmark, and Duttweiler 0.72 mark per capita for the care of their poor.\r\n\r\nThese are instances which throw light on the relief of the communities\r\nif a system similar to that of the unions would be introduced. I do\r\nnot at all intend to make so expensive a proposition to you, and I\r\nhave already said that we shall have to work on this legislation for\r\nat least a generation. But look at the glaring examples of Duttweiler\r\nand Oberneunkirchen. Without their unions their budgets for the poor\r\nwould perhaps not rise to the Berlin figure, but they would easily\r\namount to 5 marks per capita. Actually, however, they are less than 1\r\nmark, and almost as low as 1/2 mark. What a tremendous burden will be\r\ntaken from the charity departments of a city of ten thousand\r\ninhabitants by a law like the one under discussion! Why, then, should\r\nthey not be asked to make some kind of a contribution to the insurance\r\nfund? But the contributions should not be made by the districts, but\r\nby larger units, and, since the State is the largest, I insist that\r\nthe contributions should be made by the State. If you do not yield in\r\nthis point to the allied governments, I shall look placidly, and\r\nwithout being offended, toward further discussions and another session\r\nof the Reichstag. This I consider to be the all-important part of the\r\nlaw, and without it the bill would no longer appear to me to be as\r\nvaluable as I have thought it was, and would seem to lack the chief\r\ncharacteristic which induced me to become its sponsor.\r\n\r\nThe previous speaker and the Honorable Mr. Bamberger have looked\r\naskance at the Economic Council. This, gentlemen, was perfectly\r\nnatural, for competition in eloquence is as much disliked as in\r\nbusiness; and there are in this Council not only men of exceptionally\r\ngreat practical knowledge, but also some very good speakers. When the\r\nCouncil has been more firmly established these men will perhaps\r\ndeliver as long and expert speeches as those representatives are doing\r\nwho pass themselves off as the expert spokesmen of labor. I really do\r\nnot consider it to be polite, or politically advantageous, to refer to\r\nthe councillors who have come here, at the call of their king, to\r\nvoice their honest opinions with as much contempt as the\r\nrepresentatives whom I have mentioned have done. Most woods return the\r\necho of what we call into them; and why should the representative Mr.\r\nRichter unnecessarily make for himself even more enemies than he has?\r\nHe is like me, in that the number of his opponents is growing, and is\r\nno longer small. His ear, however, is not so keen as mine to detect\r\nthe existence of an opponent, and I am satisfied to wait and see which\r\none of us in the long run will appear to have been right. Possibly,\r\nthis may not be decided in our lifetime. That also will be agreeable\r\nto me.\r\n\r\nThe representative Mr. Bamberger has expressed his astonishment, in\r\ndiscussing matters with the Council, that the delegates of the\r\nsea-coast cities had been granted the right to decide about questions\r\nrelating to gunpowder and playing-cards. Well, gentlemen, the\r\ndelegates from the inland districts are far more numerous than those\r\nfrom the seacoast, and we have not made this division arbitrarily.\r\nSince we look upon the free-trade theory as an epidemic, which is\r\nafflicting us like the Colorado Beetle, or similar evils, you cannot\r\npossibly expect that we should ask the free traders to represent the\r\nwhole country in matters where we happen to have the choice. Generally\r\nspeaking, the free traders represent the interests of maritime\r\ncommerce, of merchants, and of a very few other people. Opposed to\r\nthem is the much greater weight of all the inland districts. The more,\r\ntherefore, the Economic Council will be perfected, the more the\r\npropriety and reasonableness of the present arrangement will be\r\nappreciated. The Council has, to my great delight, excellent chances\r\nof extending its usefulness over the whole empire. These remarks will\r\nscarcely win me, I believe, the good graces of Messrs. Richter and\r\nBamberger. If they did, it would be for me an _argumentum e\r\ncontrario_. I am always of the opinion that the very opposite of their\r\nviews is serviceable for the State and the interests of the\r\nfatherland, as I understand them.\r\n\r\nI have already replied to the reproach of home-socialism. One of the\r\nprevious speakers, however, goes so far as to identify me with\r\nforeigners, because I am glad to assume the responsibility for this\r\nlaw and its intellectual origin. These foreigners are, no doubt,\r\nexcellent men, but they have nothing to do with our affairs. They are\r\nmen like Nadaud, Clemenceau, Spuller, Lockroy, and others. I believe\r\nthis was intended to be a complicated reproach of both socialism and\r\ncommunism. You see, it is always the same tune. Then he mentioned the\r\n\"intrepidity,\" which I translate for myself to mean the \"frivolous\r\nlevity,\" of the government in suggesting such matters. The considerate\r\npoliteness of the speaker induced him to call it \"intrepidity.\"\r\nGentlemen, our intrepidity springs from our good conscience. We are\r\nconvinced that what we are proposing is the result of dutiful and\r\ncareful consideration, and is not in the least tinged with\r\nparty-politics. In this we are superior to our opponents, who will\r\nnever be able to free themselves from the soil of party-warfare which\r\nclings to their boots.\r\n\r\nThe previous speaker compared us also with the Romans. You see he made\r\nhis historical excursions not only into France, but also into the\r\npast. The difference between Mr. Bamberger's and our point of\r\nview--which Mr. Lasker may call aristocratic, if he chooses--appears\r\nin his very choice of words. Mr. Bamberger spoke of theatres which we\r\nwere erecting for the \"sweet rabble.\" Whether there is anything sweet\r\nin the rabble for Mr. Bamberger I do not know. But we are filled with\r\nsatisfaction at the thought that we may be able to do something in the\r\nlegislature for the less fortunate classes--whom he designates as\r\nrabble--and to wrest them, if you will grant the money, from the evil\r\ninfluences of place-hunters whose eloquence is too much for their\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\nThe expression \"rabble\" did not fall from our lips, and if the\r\nrepresentative spoke of the \"rabble\" first, and afterwards of \"those\r\nwho cut off coupons,\" I deny having used also this word. \"To cut off\r\ncoupons\" is linguistically not familiar to me. I believe I said \"those\r\nwho cut coupons.\" The meaning, of course, remains the same. But let me\r\nremark that I consider this class of people to be highly estimable,\r\nand from a minister's point of view exceedingly desirable, because\r\nthey combine wealth with that degree of diffidence which keeps them\r\nfrom all tainted or dangerous enterprises. The man who pays a large\r\ntax and loves peace is from the ministerial point of view the most\r\nagreeable of citizens. He must, of course, not try to escape the\r\nburdens which his easily collected income should bear in comparison\r\nwith others. And you will see that he really does not do it. He is an\r\nhonest man, and when we shall at last have outgrown the\r\nfinance-ministerial mistrust of olden times--which my present\r\ncolleagues no longer share--we shall see that not everybody is willing\r\nto lie for his own financial benefit, and that even the man who cuts\r\ncoupons will declare his wealth honestly, and pay his taxes\r\naccordingly. The Honorable Mr. Bamberger also asked: \"Where will you\r\nfind the necessary money?\" This law really implies few new expenses,\r\nas I have already said, because all the government asks is to be\r\npermitted to substitute the State for the communities, which at\r\npresent are taking care of the poor, and to make a very modest\r\nallowance to those who cannot earn their living. This allowance should\r\nbe entirely at the disposal of the recipient and be inalienable from\r\nhim. It will thus secure for him independence even when he is an\r\ninvalid. The increase over the present cost of caring for the poor is\r\nslight. I do not know whether it should be estimated at half of\r\none-third--one sixth--or even at less.\r\n\r\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that a State which is at war with the\r\ninfernal elements recently described to you here in detail, and which\r\npossesses among its citizens an overwhelming majority of sincere\r\nadherents of the Christian religion, should do for the poor, the weak,\r\nand the old much more than this bill demands--as much as I hope to be\r\nable to ask of you next year. And such a State, especially when it\r\nwishes to demonstrate its practical Christianity, should not refuse\r\nour demands, for its own sake and for the sake of the poor!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWE GERMANS FEAR GOD, AND NOUGHT ELSE IN THE WORLD\r\n\r\nFebruary 6, 1888\r\n\r\nTRANSLATED BY EDMUND VON MACH, PH.D.\r\n\r\n[In view of the constantly increasing armaments in France, the\r\ngovernment had secured from the Reichstag of 1887 an increase also of\r\nthe German army. Danger, however, was threatening from Russia as well\r\nas from France, and it became necessary to arrange matters in a way\r\nwhich would place the full strength of the German people at the\r\ndisposal of the government. A bill to this effect was introduced in\r\nthe Reichstag on December 9, 1887, and another bill, which was to\r\nprocure the money for this increase in armaments, was introduced on\r\nJanuary 31, 1888. Both bills were on the calendar of February 6.\r\nPrince Bismarck opened the discussion with the following speech, the\r\neffect of which was electric, and resulted in the Reichstag passing\r\nboth bills by a unanimous vote.]\r\n\r\nIn addressing you today I do not intend to recommend to you the\r\nacceptance of the bill which your president has just mentioned. I have\r\nno fear concerning its acceptance, nor do I believe that I can do\r\nanything to increase the majority with which it will be passed,\r\nalthough this is, of course, of great importance both at home and\r\nabroad. The representatives of the various parties have, no doubt,\r\ndecided how they will vote, and I am confident that the German\r\nReichstag will grant us again an increase in our armed force and thus\r\nreëstablish the standard which we gradually gave up between 1867 and\r\n1882, and will do so, not on account of the position in which we\r\nhappen to find ourselves, nor of any fears which may be swaying the\r\nstock exchange and public opinion, but because of an anticipatory\r\nestimate of the general conditions of Europe. In addressing you,\r\ntherefore, I shall have to say more about these conditions than about\r\nthe bill.\r\n\r\nI do not like to do this, for in these matters one unskilful word can\r\ndo great harm, and many words can do small good beyond making people\r\nunderstand the situation at home and abroad, which they will do in due\r\ntime anyhow. I do not like to speak, but if I should keep silence the\r\nnervous excitement of public opinion at home and abroad will be\r\nincreased rather than decreased, I fear, in view of the expectations\r\nwhich have been based on today's debate. People would believe the\r\nsituation to be so difficult and critical that a minister of foreign\r\naffairs did not even dare to touch upon it. For these reasons I am\r\naddressing you, but I must say that I am doing it reluctantly.\r\n\r\nI might be satisfied with a reference to what I said here just about a\r\nyear ago, for matters are but slightly changed. A newspaper clipping\r\nhas been handed to me containing a summary in the _Liberal News_, an\r\norgan which has closer relations, I believe, with my political friend,\r\nthe Honorable Mr. Richter, than with myself. This clipping might offer\r\nme a starting point from which to develop the situation as a whole,\r\nbut I can refer to it, and the chief points made there, only with the\r\ngeneral declaration that the situation has been improved rather than\r\notherwise, if it has been changed at all.\r\n\r\nA year ago we were largely concerned with the possible cause of war\r\nemanating from France. Since then a peace-loving president has dropped\r\nthe reins of government, and another peace-loving president has\r\nsucceeded him. It is a favorable sign that the French government did\r\nnot dip into Pandora's box in calling to office another chief\r\nmagistrate, and that we may be assured of the continuance under\r\nPresident Carnot of the peaceful policy which President Grévy was\r\nknown to represent. Changes in the French cabinet are even more\r\nreassuring than the change in the presidency, where a great many\r\ndifferent reasons had to be considered. The ministers who might have\r\nbeen ready to subordinate the peace of their own country and of\r\nEurope to their personal plans have resigned, and others have taken\r\ntheir places of whom we need not fear this. I believe, therefore that\r\nI may state that our outlook toward France is more peaceful and less\r\nexplosive today than it was a year ago and I am glad to do this,\r\nbecause I wish to quiet, not to excite, public opinion.\r\n\r\nThe fears which have sprung up during the last twelve months have had\r\nto do more with Russia than with France, or I may say with the\r\nexchange of mutual excitement, threats, insults, and challenges in the\r\nFrench and Russian papers during the past summer.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I believe that our relations with Russia have not\r\nchanged from what they were last year. The _Liberal News_ has stated,\r\nin especially heavy type, that I said a year ago: \"Our friendship with\r\nRussia has suffered no interruption during our wars, and is today\r\nbeyond a doubt. We expect of Russia neither an attack nor a hostile\r\npolicy.\" The reason why this was printed in heavy type may have been\r\neither to give me an easy starting point, or because the writer hoped\r\nthat I had changed my mind since I said these things, and was at\r\npresent convinced that I had erred in my confidence in the Russian\r\npolicy a year ago. This is not the case. The only events which could\r\nhave occasioned a change of opinion are the attitude of the Russian\r\npress and the allocation of the Russian troops.\r\n\r\nAs regards the press, I cannot assign any importance to it _per se_.\r\nPeople say that it is of greater consequence in Russia than in France.\r\nI believe the very opposite to be true. In France the press is a power\r\ninfluencing the decisions of the government. In Russia it is not, nor\r\ncan it be. In both cases, however, the press is, so far as I am\r\nconcerned, mere printer's ink on paper, against which we do not wage\r\nwar. It cannot contain a challenge for us. Back of each article in the\r\npress there stands after all only the single man who guided the pen\r\nwhich launched this particular article into the world. Even in a\r\nRussian sheet--suppose it to be an independent Russian sheet,\r\none which maintains relations with the French secret funds, it is of\r\nno consequence. The pen which there indites an anti-German article is\r\nbacked by no one but him who is guiding it, the solitary man who is\r\nconcocting the sad stuff in his office, and the protector which every\r\nRussian sheet is accustomed to have. He is some kind of a higher\r\nofficial, run wild in party politics, who happens to bestow his\r\nprotection on this particular paper. Both weigh like feathers in the\r\nscale against the authority of His Majesty the Emperor of Russia.\r\n\r\nIn Russia the press has not the same influence on public opinion as in\r\nFrance. At best its declarations are the barometer by which to gauge\r\nhow much can be printed according to the Russian press-laws, but they\r\ndo not obligate the Russian government or His Majesty the Emperor of\r\nRussia in any way. In contrast with the voices of the Russian press I\r\nhave the immediate testimony of Emperor Alexander himself, when a few\r\nmonths ago I had again the honor of being received by him in audience\r\nafter the lapse of several years. I was then able to convince myself\r\nafresh that the emperor of Russia harbors no hostile feelings against\r\nus and does not intend to attack us, or to wage any aggressive wars at\r\nall. What the Russian press says, I do not believe, what Emperor\r\nAlexander says, I believe; I have absolute confidence in it. When both\r\nare in the scales, the testimony of the Russian press, with its hatred\r\nof Germany, rises light as a feather, and the personal testimony of\r\nEmperor Alexander has the only effective weight, so far as I am\r\nconcerned. I repeat, therefore, the press does not induce me to\r\nconsider our relations with Russia to be worse today than they were a\r\nyear ago.\r\n\r\nI now come to the other point, the allocation of the troops. It used\r\nto take place on a big scale, but only since 1879, when the Turkish\r\nwar was concluded, has it assumed the proportions which today seem\r\nthreatening. It may easily appear as if this accumulation of Russian\r\ntroops near the German and Austrian frontiers--where their support\r\nis more difficult and more expensive than farther inland--could only\r\nbe dictated by the intention of surprising and attacking one of the\r\nneighbors unprepared, _sans dire gare!_ (I cannot for the moment think\r\nof the German expression.) Well, I do not believe this. In the first\r\nplace, it would be contrary to the character of the sovereign and his\r\nown words, and secondly its object could not easily be understood.\r\nRussia cannot intend to conquer any Prussian provinces, nor, I\r\nbelieve, any Austrian provinces. Russia has, I believe, as many Polish\r\nsubjects as it cares to have, and has no desire to increase their\r\nnumbers. To annex anything but Polish districts from Austria would be\r\neven more difficult. No reason exists, no pretense which could induce\r\na European monarch suddenly to assail his neighbors. I even go so far\r\nin my confidence as to be convinced that a Russian war would not ensue\r\nif we should become involved in a French war because of some explosive\r\nhappenings in France, which no one can foresee and which surely are\r\nnot intended by the present French government. A French war, on the\r\nother hand, would be an absolute certainty if we should be involved in\r\na Russian war, for no French government would be so strong that it\r\ncould prevent it, even if it was inclined to do so. But as regards\r\nRussia I still declare that I am not looking for an attack; and I take\r\nback nothing from what I said last year.\r\n\r\nYou will ask: \"If that is so, what is the use of this expensive\r\nallocation of the Russian troops?\" That is one of the questions for\r\nwhich one hardly can expect an answer from a ministry of foreign\r\naffairs, itself vitally interested. If we should begin to ask for\r\nexplanations, we might receive forced replies, and our surrejoinders\r\nwould also have to be forced. That is a dangerous path which I do not\r\nlike to tread. Allocations of troops are things for which one does not\r\ntake the other country to task, asking for categorical explanations,\r\nbut against which one takes counter precautions with equal reserve and\r\ncircumspection. I cannot, therefore, give an authentic declaration\r\nconcerning the motives of this Russian allocation, but, having been\r\nfamiliar through a generation with foreign politics and the policy of\r\nRussia, I can form my own ideas concerning them. These ideas lead me\r\nto assume that the Russian cabinet is convinced, probably with good\r\nreason, that the weight of the Russian voice in the diplomatic\r\nAreopagos of Europe will be the weightier in the next European crisis,\r\nthe stronger Russia is on the European frontier and the farther west\r\nthe Russian armies stand. Russia is the more quickly at hand, either\r\nas an ally or as a foe, the nearer her main army, or at least a large\r\narmy, is to her western frontier.\r\n\r\nThis policy has directed the Russian allocation of troops for a long\r\nwhile. You will remember that the army assembled in the Polish kingdom\r\nduring the Crimean War was so large that this war might have ended\r\ndifferently if the army had started on time. If you think farther\r\nback, you will see that the events of 1830 found Russia unprepared and\r\nnot ready to take a hand, because she had an insufficient number of\r\ntroops in the western part of her empire. I need not, therefore, draw\r\nthe conclusion from the accumulation of Russian troops in the western\r\nprovinces (_sapadnii Gubernii_, as the Russians say), that our\r\nneighbors mean to attack us. I assume they are waiting, possibly for\r\nanother Oriental crisis, intending then to be in the position of\r\npressing home the Russian wishes by means of an army situated not\r\nexactly in Kasan, but farther west.\r\n\r\nWhen may such an Oriental crisis take place, you ask. Forsooth, we\r\nhave no certainty. During this century we have had, I think, four\r\ncrises, if I do not include the smaller ones and those which did not\r\nculminate. One was in 1809 and ended with the treaty which gave Russia\r\nthe Pruth-frontier, and another in 1828. Then there was the Crimean\r\nWar of 1854, and the war of 1877. They have happened, therefore, at\r\nintervals of about twenty years and over. Why, then, should the next\r\ncrisis take place sooner than after a similar interval, or at about\r\n1899, twenty years after the last one? I for one should like to\r\nreckon with the possibility of its being postponed and not occurring\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nThen there are other European events which are wont to take place at\r\neven intervals, the Polish uprisings, for instance. Formerly we had to\r\nexpect one every eighteen or twenty years. Possibly this is one reason\r\nwhy Russia wishes to be so strong in Poland that she may prevent them.\r\nThen there are the changes of government in France which also used to\r\nhappen every eighteen or twenty years; and no one can deny that a\r\nchange of government in France may bring about such a crisis that\r\nevery interested nation may wish to be able to intervene with her full\r\nmight--I mean only diplomatically, but with a diplomacy which is\r\nbacked by an efficient army close at hand.\r\n\r\nI assume on the strength of my purely technical-diplomatic judgment,\r\nwhich is based on my experience, that these are the intentions of\r\nRussia and that she has no wish to comply with the somewhat uncouth\r\nthreats and boastings of the newspapers. And, if this is so, then\r\nthere is surely no reason why we should look more gloomily into the\r\nfuture now than we have done at any time during the past forty years.\r\nThe Oriental crisis is undoubtedly the most likely to occur, and in\r\nthis our interests are only secondary. When it happens, we are in a\r\nposition to watch whether the powers, who are primarily interested in\r\nthe Mediterranean and the Levante, will make their decisions and come\r\nto terms, if they choose, or go to war with Russia about them. We are\r\nnot immediately called upon to do either. Every great power which is\r\ntrying to influence or to restrain the policies of other countries in\r\nmatters which are beyond the sphere of its interests is playing\r\npolitics beyond the bounds which God has assigned to it. Its policy is\r\none of force and not of vital interests. It is working for prestige.\r\nWe shall not do this. If Oriental crises happen, we shall wait before\r\ntaking our position until the powers who have greater interests at\r\nstake than we have declared themselves. There is, therefore, no\r\nreason, gentlemen, why you should look upon our present situation with\r\nunusual gravity, assuming this to be the cause of our asking for the\r\nmighty increase of our armaments which the military bill contemplates.\r\nI should like to separate the question of reëstablishing the\r\n_Landwehr_ of the second grade, in short the big military bill and the\r\nfinancial bill, from the question of our present situation. It has to\r\ndo, not with a temporary and transient arrangement, but with the\r\npermanent invigoration of the German empire.\r\n\r\nThat no temporary arrangement is contemplated will be perfectly clear,\r\nI believe, when I ask you to survey with me the dangers of war which\r\nwe have met in the past forty years without having become nervously\r\nexcited at any one time.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1848, when many dikes and flood gates were broken, which\r\nuntil then had directed the peaceful flow of countless waters, we had\r\nto dispose of two questions freighted with the danger of war. They\r\nconcerned Poland and Schleswig-Holstein. The first shouts after the\r\nMartial days were: war with Russia for the rehabilitation of Poland!\r\nSoon thereafter the danger was perilously near of being involved in a\r\ngreat European war on account of Schleswig-Holstein. I need not\r\nemphasize how the agreement of Olmütz, in 1850, prevented a great\r\nconflagration--a war on a gigantic scale. Then there followed two\r\nyears of greater quiet out of general ill feeling, at the time when I\r\nfirst was ambassador in Frankfort. In 1853 the earliest symptoms of\r\nthe Crimean War made themselves felt. This war lasted from 1853 to\r\n1856, and during this whole time we were near the edge of the cliff, I\r\nwill not say the abyss, whence it was intended to draw us into the\r\nwar. I remember that I was obliged at that time, from 1853 to 1855 to\r\nalternate like a pendulum, so to speak, between Frankfort and Berlin\r\nbecause the late king, thanks to the confidence he had in me, used me\r\nas the real advocate of his independent policy whenever the\r\ninsistence of the western powers that we too should declare war on\r\nRussia grew too strong, and the opposition of his cabinet too flabby\r\nfor his liking. Then the play was staged--I do not know how\r\noften--when I was called back here and ordered to write for His\r\nMajesty a more pro-Russian dispatch, and Mr. von Manteuffel resigned,\r\nand I requested to be instructed by His Majesty to follow Mr. von\r\nManteuffel, after the dispatch was gone, into the country or anywhere\r\nelse, and to induce him to resume his office. Yet each time Prussia,\r\nas it was then constituted, was hovering on the brink of a great war.\r\nIt was exposed to the hostility of the whole of Europe, except Russia,\r\nif it refused to join in the policies of the west European powers,\r\nand, if it did, it was forced to break with Russia, possibly for a\r\nvery long while, because the defection of Prussia would probably have\r\nbeen felt very painfully in Russia.\r\n\r\nDuring the Crimean War, therefore, we were in constant danger of war.\r\nThe war lasted till 1856, when it was at last concluded by the treaty\r\nof Paris, and we found, in the Congress of Paris a sort of Canossa\r\nprepared for us, for which I should not have assumed the\r\nresponsibility, and against which I vainly counseled at the time. We\r\nwere not at all obliged to play the part of a greater power than we\r\nwere, and to sign the treaties made there. But we were dancing\r\nattendance with the view of being permitted to sign the treaty. This\r\nwill not again happen to us.\r\n\r\nThat was in 1856, and as early as in 1857 the problem of Neuchâtel was\r\nagain threatening us with war. This did not become generally known. In\r\nthe spring of that year I was sent to Paris by the late king to\r\nnegotiate with Emperor Napoleon concerning the passage of Prussian\r\ntroops in an attack upon Switzerland. Everyone who hears this from me\r\nwill know what this would have meant in case of an understanding, and\r\nthat it could have become a far-reaching danger of war, and might have\r\ninvolved us with France as well as with other powers. Emperor Napoleon\r\n was not unwilling to agree. My negotiations in Paris, however, were\r\nterminated because his majesty the king in the meanwhile had come to\r\nan amicable understanding in the matter with Austria and Switzerland.\r\nBut the danger of war, we must agree, was present also during that\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nWhile I was on this mission in Paris, the Italian War hung in the air.\r\nIt broke out a little more than a year later and came very near\r\ndrawing us into a big general war of Europe. We went so far as to\r\nmobilize, and we should undoubtedly have taken the field, if the peace\r\nof Villafranca had not been concluded, somewhat prematurely for\r\nAustria, but just in time for ourselves, for we should have been\r\nobliged to wage this war under unfavorable circumstances. We should\r\nhave turned this war, which was an Italian affair, into a\r\nFranco-Prussian war, and its cessation, outcome, and treaty of peace\r\nwould no longer have depended on us, but on the friends and enemies\r\nwho stood behind us.\r\n\r\nThus we came into the sixties without the clouds of war having cleared\r\nfrom the horizon for even one single year.\r\n\r\nAlready in 1863 another war threatened hardly less ominously, of which\r\nthe people at large knew little, and which will only be appreciated\r\nwhen the secret archives of the cabinets will be made public. You may\r\nremember the Polish uprising of 1863, and I shall never forget the\r\nmorning calls which I used to receive at that time from Sir Andrew\r\nBuchanan, the English ambassador, and Talleyrand, the French\r\nrepresentative, who tried to frighten me out of my wits by attacking\r\nthe Prussian policy for its inexcusable adherence to Russia, and who\r\nused rather a threatening language with me. At noon of the same days I\r\nthen used to have the pleasure of listening in the Prussian diet to\r\nsomewhat the same arguments and attacks which the foreign ambassadors\r\nhad made upon me in the morning. I suffered it quietly, but Emperor\r\nAlexander lost his patience, and wished to draw his sword against the\r\nplotting of the western powers. You will remember that the\r\nFrench forces were then engaged with American projects and in Mexico,\r\nwhich prevented France from taking a vigorous stand. The Emperor of\r\nRussia was no longer willing to stand the Polish intrigues of the\r\nother powers, and was ready to face events in our company and to go to\r\nwar. You will remember that Prussia was struggling at that time with\r\ndifficult interior problems, and that in Germany the leaven had begun\r\nto work in the minds of the people, and the council of the princes in\r\nFrankfort was under contemplation. It may be readily granted,\r\ntherefore, that the temptation for my gracious master was very strong\r\nto cut, and thus to heal, his difficult position at home by agreeing\r\nto a military undertaking on a colossal scale.\r\n\r\nAt that time war of Prussia and Russia together against those who were\r\nprotecting the Polish insurrection against us would undoubtedly have\r\ntaken place if his majesty had not recoiled from the thought of\r\nsolving home difficulties, Prussian as well as German, with foreign\r\nhelp. We declined in silence, and without revealing to the other\r\nGerman powers who had hostile projects against us the reasons which\r\nhad determined our course. The subsequent death of the King of Denmark\r\nchanged the trend of thought of everybody interested. But all that was\r\nneeded to bring about the great coalition war in 1863 was a \"Yes\"\r\ninstead of a \"No\" from His Majesty the King in Gastein. Anybody but a\r\nGerman minister would perhaps have counseled affirmatively, from\r\nreasons of utility and opportunism in order to solve thereby our home\r\ndifficulties. You see neither our own people nor foreigners really\r\nhave a proper appreciation of the amount of national loyalty and high\r\nprinciples which guides both the sovereign and his ministers in the\r\ngovernment of German states.\r\n\r\nThe year 1864--we just spoke of 1863--brought a new pressing danger of\r\nwar. From the moment when our troops crossed the Eider, I was ready\r\nevery week to see the European Council of Elders interfere in this\r\nDanish affair, and you will agree with me that this was highly\r\nprobable. But in those days we could observe that it is not so very\r\neasy for Europe to attack Austria and Prussia when they are united;\r\nand remember that the German federation which supported these two\r\nstates at that time had not nearly the same military importance which\r\nthe identical countries possess today. The difficulty of an attack on\r\nAustria and Prussia showed itself even then, but the danger of a war\r\nremained the same.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 it faced about, and the preparations for the war of 1866 were\r\nbeginning. I only remember a meeting of the Prussian cabinet which\r\ntook place in Regensburg in 1865 with a view to procuring the\r\nnecessary money, but which was rendered futile by the agreement of\r\nGastein. In 1866, however, the war broke out in full force, as you\r\nknow. A circumspect use of events alone enabled us to ward off the\r\nexisting danger of turning this duel between Prussia and Austria into\r\na fierce European war of coalition, when our very existence, our life\r\nand all we had, would have been at stake.\r\n\r\nThis was in 1866, and in 1867 the Luxembourg problem arose, when only\r\na somewhat firmer reply was needed to bring about the great French war\r\nin that year,--and we might have given it, if we had been so strong\r\nthat we could have counted on sure success. From then on, during 1868,\r\n1869, and up to 1870 we were living in constant apprehension of war,\r\nand of the agreements which in the time of Mr. von Beust were being\r\nmade in Salzburg and other places between France, Italy, and Austria,\r\nand which, we feared, were directed against us. The apprehension of\r\nwar was so great at that time that I received calls--I was the\r\nPresident of the cabinet--from merchants and manufacturers, who said:\r\n\"The uncertainty is unbearable. Why don't you strike the first blow?\r\nWar is preferable to this continued damper on all business!\" We waited\r\nquietly until we were struck, and I believe we did well to arrange\r\nmatters so that we were the nation which was assailed and were not\r\nourselves the assailants.\r\n\r\nNow, since the great war of 1870 was waged, has there been a year, I\r\nask you, without the danger of war? In the first years of the\r\nseventies--the very moment we came home, the question arose: \"When\r\nwill be the next war? When will revenge be given? Within five years at\r\nthe latest, no doubt?\" We were told: \"The question whether we shall\r\nhave to fight and with what success surely rests with Russia\r\nnow-a-days. Russia alone holds the hilt.\" It was a representative of\r\nthe Catholic party who thus remonstrated with me in the Reichstag. I\r\nmay possibly revert to this subject later. In the meanwhile I wish to\r\ncomplete the picture of the forty years by saying that in 1876 the\r\nclouds of war again began to gather in the south. In 1877 the Balkan\r\nWar was waged, which would have led to a conflagration of the whole of\r\nEurope, if this had not been prevented by the Congress gathered in\r\nBerlin. After the Congress an entirely new eastern picture presented\r\nitself to us, for Russia was offended by our attitude in the Congress.\r\nI may revert to this later, if my strength permits.\r\n\r\nThen there followed a period when we felt the results of the intimate\r\nrelations of the three emperors, which for some time permitted us to\r\nface the future with greater placidity. But at the first symptoms of\r\nany instability in the relations of the three emperors or of the\r\ntermination of the agreements which they had made with one another,\r\npublic opinion was possessed by the same nervous and, I believe,\r\nexaggerated excitement with which we have had to contend these last\r\nyears, and which I consider especially uncalled for today.\r\n\r\nFrom my belief that this excitement is uncalled for I am far from\r\ndrawing the conclusion that we do not need an increase in our\r\narmaments. The very opposite is my view, and this may explain the\r\ntableau of forty years which I have just exhibited before you,\r\npossibly not for your enjoyment, and I ask your pardon.\r\n[Illustration: THE BISMARCK MONUMENT AT HAMBURG LEDERER]\r\n\r\nBut if I had omitted even one of those years, which you yourselves\r\nhave lived through with trembling, you would not have received the\r\nimpression that the state of apprehension of great wars is permanent\r\nwith us. Great complications and all kinds of coalitions, which no one\r\ncan foresee, are constantly possible and we must be prepared for them.\r\nWe must be so strong, irrespective of momentary conditions, that we\r\ncan face any coalition with the assurance of a great nation which is\r\nstrong enough under circumstances to take her fate into her own hands.\r\nWe must be able to face our fate placidly with that self reliance and\r\nconfidence in God which are ours when we are strong and our cause is\r\njust. And the Government will see to it that the German cause will be\r\njust always.\r\n\r\nWe must, to put it briefly, be as strong in these times as we possibly\r\ncan be, and we can be stronger than any other nation of equal numbers\r\nin the world. I shall revert to this later--but it would be criminal\r\nif we were not to make use of our opportunity. If we do not need our\r\nfull armed strength, we need not summon it. The only problem is the\r\nnot very weighty one of money--not very weighty I say in passing,\r\nbecause I have no wish to enter upon a discussion of the financial and\r\nmilitary figures, and of the fact that France has spent three\r\nmilliards for the improvement of her armaments these last years, while\r\nwe have spent scarcely one and one half milliards, including what we\r\nare asking of you at this time. But I leave the elucidation of this to\r\nthe minister of war and the representatives of the treasury\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\nWhen I say that it is our duty to endeavor to be ready at all times\r\nand for all emergencies, I imply that we must make greater exertions\r\nthan other people for the same purpose, because of our geographical\r\nposition. We are situated in the heart of Europe, and have at least\r\nthree fronts open to an attack. France has only her eastern, and\r\nRussia only her western frontier where they may be attacked. We are\r\nalso more exposed to the dangers of a coalition than any other nation,\r\nas is proved by the whole development of history, by our geographical\r\nposition, and the lesser degree of cohesiveness, which until now has\r\ncharacterized the German nation in comparison with others. God has\r\nplaced us where we are prevented, thanks to our neighbors from growing\r\nlazy and dull. He has placed by our side the most warlike and restless\r\nof all nations, the French, and He has permitted warlike inclinations\r\nto grow strong in Russia, where formerly they existed to a lesser\r\ndegree. Thus we are given the spur, so to speak, from both sides, and\r\nare compelled to exertions which we should perhaps not be making\r\notherwise. The pikes in the European carp-pond are keeping us from\r\nbeing carps by making us feel their teeth on both sides. They also are\r\nforcing us to an exertion which without them we might not make, and to\r\na union among us Germans, which is abhorrent to us at heart. By nature\r\nwe are rather tending away, the one from the other. But the\r\nFranco-Russian press within which we are squeezed compels us to hold\r\ntogether, and by pressure our cohesive force is greatly increased.\r\nThis will bring us to that state of being inseparable which all other\r\nnations possess, while we do not yet enjoy it. But we must respond to\r\nthe intentions of Providence by making ourselves so strong that the\r\npikes can do nothing but encourage us.\r\n\r\nFormerly in the years of the Holy Alliance--I am just thinking of an\r\nAmerican song which I learned of my late friend Motley: \"In good old\r\ncolonial times, when we lived under a King\"--well those were the good\r\nold patriarchal times when we had many posts to guide us, and many\r\ndikes to protect us from the wild floods of Europe. There were the\r\nGerman Union, and the real support and consummation of the German\r\nUnion, the Holy Alliance. We had support in Russia and in Austria,\r\nand, above all, the guaranty of our diffidence that we should never\r\nexpress an opinion before the others had spoken.\r\n\r\nAll this we have lost; we must help ourselves. The Holy Alliance was\r\nwrecked in the Crimean War--not through our fault. The German Union\r\nhas been destroyed by us, because the existence which we were granted\r\nwithin it was unbearable in the long run for ourselves and the German\r\npeople as well. After the dissolution of the German Union and the war\r\nof 1866, Prussia, as it was then, or North Germany, would have become\r\nisolated, if we had been obliged to count with the fact that nobody\r\nwould be willing to pardon our new successes--the great successes\r\nwhich we had won. No great power looks with favor on the successes of\r\nits neighbors.\r\n\r\nOur relations with Russia, however, were not disturbed by the\r\nexperience of 1866. In that year the memory of Count Buol's policy and\r\nof the policy of Austria during the Crimean War was too fresh in\r\nRussia to permit the rise of the thought that Russia could assist the\r\nAustrian monarchy against the Prussian attack, or could renew the\r\ncampaign, which Emperor Nicholas had fought for Austria in 1849--ask\r\nyour pardon, if I sit down for a moment. I cannot stand so long.\r\n\r\nOur most natural support, therefore, still remained with Russia, due\r\nvery properly to the policy of Emperor Alexander I. in this\r\ncentury--not to speak of the last century at all. In 1813 he might\r\nwell have turned back at the Polish frontier, and have made peace, and\r\nlater he might have dropped Prussia. We certainly owed our\r\nreëstablishment on the old basis at that time to the benevolence of\r\nEmperor Alexander I.--or, if you wish to be sceptical, you may say to\r\nthe Russian policy, which was such as Prussia needed. Gratitude for\r\nthis dominated the reign of Frederick William III. The credit,\r\nhowever, which Russia had in the Prussian accounts was used up by the\r\nfriendship, I may even say servility, of Prussia during the entire\r\nreign of Emperor Nicholas, and was, I own, wiped out at Olmütz. There\r\nEmperor Nicholas did not take the part of Prussia, nor did he keep us\r\nfrom evil experiences or certain humiliations, for Emperor Nicholas\r\nreally preferred Austria to Prussia. The idea that we owed\r\nRussia any thanks during his reign is a historical myth.\r\n\r\nWe did, nevertheless, not break our traditional relations with Russia\r\nwhile he lived; and in the Crimean War we remained true, as I said\r\nbefore, to our Russian duty, in spite of many threats and great\r\ndangers. His Majesty, the late King, had no desire to play a decisive\r\npart in the war by a great levy of troops, as I believe we could have\r\ndone. We had made certain treaties requiring us to put in the field\r\n100,000 men after the lapse of a stated time; and I proposed to His\r\nMajesty to levy not 100,000 but 200,000 men, and mounted at that, whom\r\nwe could use as well toward the right as toward the left, in which\r\ncase, I said, Your Majesty will be the arbiter of the Crimean War. But\r\nthe late King did not cherish warlike enterprises, and the people\r\nought to be grateful to him. I was younger then, and less experienced\r\nthan I am today. At any rate we harbored no resentment for Olmütz\r\nduring the Crimean War. We came out of this war as the friends of\r\nRussia, and I was enabled to enjoy the fruit of this friendship, when\r\nas ambassador I was most kindly received in St. Petersburg, both at\r\ncourt and in society at large. Even our espousing the cause of Austria\r\nin the Italian War, while not to the liking of the Russian cabinet,\r\nshowed no harmful effects. Our war of 1866 was regarded in Russia with\r\na certain amount of satisfaction, for the Russians were glad to see\r\nAustria suffer. In our French war of 1870 we were fortunate enough to\r\nbe able to serve the Russian interests in the Black Sea at the same\r\ntime that we were successful in defending and guarding our own. The\r\ncontracting parties probably would not have removed their restrictions\r\nfrom the Black Sea, if the victorious German troops had not been\r\nstanding near Paris. If we had been beaten, the London agreement in\r\nthe interest of Russia would not have been made so easily, I believe.\r\nThus also the war of 1870 carried in its train no disagreement between\r\nus and Russia. I mention these matters in order to explain to you\r\nthe origin of our treaty with Austria, which was published a few days\r\nago, and to defend the policy of His Majesty against the reproach of\r\nhaving enlarged the possibilities of war for the German empire, by\r\nadding to them the chances which may befall Austria without any fault\r\nof her own. I am, therefore, going to describe to you how it happened\r\nthat our traditional relations with Russia, which I had always and\r\nvery gladly fostered, became so altered that we were induced to\r\nconclude the treaty published day before yesterday.\r\n\r\nThe first years after the French war passed in the best of friendship.\r\nIn 1875 there suddenly appeared the inclination of my Russian\r\ncolleague, Prince Gortschakoff, to work for popularity with France\r\nrather than with us, and to make the world believe, by means of\r\ncertain artificially created events and an interpolated telegram, that\r\nwe had harbored the idea, however remote, of invading France, and that\r\nhis intercession alone had saved France from this danger. This\r\noccasioned the first estrangement between us, and led to a serious\r\ndiscussion between me and my former friend and later colleague. All\r\nthis time and subsequently we were still clinging to the task of\r\nmaintaining peace among the three emperors, and of continuing the\r\nrelationship begun by the visits of the emperors of Russia and Austria\r\nhere in Berlin in 1872, and the subsequent return visits. We were\r\nsucceeding in this, when in 1876, before the Turkish War, pressure was\r\nbrought to bear upon us to choose between Russia and Austria. This we\r\nrefused to do. I do not deem it advantageous to discuss the details.\r\nThey will be known some time. The result of our refusal was that\r\nRussia turned to Vienna directly, and entered into an agreement with\r\nAustria--I believe it was in January, 1877--concerning the\r\npossibilities of an Oriental crisis, granting her, if The crisis\r\nshould take place, the occupation of Bosnia, etc. Then the war took\r\nplace, and we were very glad that the storm raged further south than\r\nit had threatened at first. The war was definitely concluded here in\r\nBerlin by the Congress, after the preliminaries had been settled by\r\nthe peace of San Stefano. The peace of San Stefano, I am convinced,\r\nwas not more risky for the anti-Russian powers nor much more favorable\r\nfor Russia than the subsequent congressional treaty. The stipulations\r\nof San Stefano were realized, one may say, of their own accord later\r\non, when the little state of East Rumelia, with only 800,000 souls I\r\nbelieve, joined Bulgaria and thereby reestablished on its own\r\nresponsibility the old San Stefano frontier, although not quite\r\nexactly. The damage, therefore, which the Congress inflicted on the\r\nagreements of San Stefano was not very considerable. Whether these\r\nagreements were masterpieces of diplomacy I leave undecided. We had\r\nthen very little desire to mix in Oriental affairs, just as we have\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\nI was seriously ill in Friedrichsruh when I was officially notified of\r\nthe Russian wish to call a Congress of the great powers in Berlin for\r\nthe definite settlement of the war. I was at first not favorably\r\ninclined, because I was physically incapacitated, and because I did\r\nnot wish to involve ourselves in these matters to the extent which the\r\npresidency of a Congress necessitates. My final compliance was partly\r\ndue to the German sense of duty, which does anything in the interest\r\nof peace, and partly to the grateful memory of the favors of Alexander\r\nI., which I have always remembered, and which induced me to grant also\r\nthis request. I declared my willingness, provided we could secure the\r\nacceptance of England and Austria. Russia undertook to secure the\r\nconsent of England, and I agreed to recommend the plan in Vienna. We\r\nwere successful, and the Congress took place.\r\n\r\nDuring the Congress, I may well say, I played my part--without hurting\r\nthe interests of my country or of our friends--just as if I had been\r\nthe fourth Russian plenipotentiary--I may almost say the third, for I\r\ncan hardly accept Prince Gortschakoff as a representative of the\r\nthen Russian policy, which was more truly represented by Count\r\nSchuwaloff.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole course of the congressional deliberations I heard of\r\nno Russian wish which I did not recommend and push through. Thanks to\r\nthe confidence which Lord Beaconsfield--unfortunately dead\r\nnow--reposed in me, I called at his sickbed in the middle of the night\r\nduring the most difficult and critical moments of the Congress, when\r\ndisruption seemed near, and obtained his consent. In short my behavior\r\nin the Congress was such that I said to myself when it was over: \"If\r\nthe highest Russian decoration set in diamonds had not been bestowed\r\nupon me long ago, I should surely receive it now.\" I had the feeling\r\nof having done something for a foreign power which is rarely\r\nvouchsafed to a foreign minister to do.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, were my surprise and natural disappointment, when\r\ngradually a sort of newspaper campaign began in St. Petersburg,\r\nattacking the German policy, and casting suspicion on my personal\r\nintentions. These attacks increased in the following year to the\r\nstrong request, in 1879, for pressure to be exerted by us on Austria\r\nin matters where we could not attack the Austrian rights as such. I\r\ncould not consent, for, if we should have been estranged from Austria,\r\nwe should necessarily have fallen into a dependence on Russia, unless\r\nwe were satisfied with standing entirely alone in Europe. Would such a\r\ndependence have been bearable? Formerly I had believed it might be,\r\nwhen I had said to myself: \"We have no conflicting interests at all.\r\nThere is no reason why Russia should ever cancel our friendship.\" At\r\nleast I had never contradicted my Russian colleagues when they\r\nexpounded such theories to me. The Russian behavior concerning the\r\nCongress disappointed me and told me that we were not protected from\r\nbeing drawn into a conflict with Russia against our wishes, even if we\r\nplaced our policy (for a time) completely at her disposal. The\r\ndisagreement concerning instructions which we had given or had not\r\ngiven to our representatives in the south grew, until threats\r\nresulted, threats of war from the most authoritative quarter.\r\n\r\nThis is the origin of our Austrian Treaty. By these threats we were\r\ncompelled to choose between our two former friends, a decision which I\r\nhad avoided through several decades. At that time I negotiated in\r\nGastein and in Vienna the treaty which was published day before\r\nyesterday and which is in force between us today.\r\n\r\nThe publication has been partly misunderstood in the newspapers, as I\r\nread yesterday and the day before. People have wanted to see in it an\r\nultimatum, a warning, and a threat. A threat could not possibly be\r\ncontained in it, since the text of the treaty has been known to Russia\r\nfor a long while, and not only since November of last year. We\r\nconsidered it due to the sincerity of so loyal a monarch as the\r\nEmperor of Russia not to leave a doubt concerning the actual state of\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nPersonally I see no chance for us _not_ to have concluded this treaty.\r\nIf we had not done it, we should have to do it _now_. It possesses the\r\nfinest quality of an international treaty, in that it is the\r\nexpression of the lasting interests of both parties, Austria as well\r\nas ourselves. No great power can for any length of time cling to the\r\nwording of a treaty against the interests of its own people; it will\r\nat last be forced to declare openly: \"Times have changed; we can no\r\nlonger do this;\" and will have to defend its action as best it can\r\nbefore its own people and the other contracting party. But no power\r\nwill approve a course which leads its own people to destruction, for\r\nthe sake of the letter of a treaty signed under different conditions.\r\nNothing of this kind, however, is contained in these treaties. The\r\ntreaty concluded with Austria, as well as other similar ones existing\r\nbetween us and other powers, notably some agreements into which we\r\nhave entered with Italy, are the expression of common interests in\r\nmutual aspirations and dangers. Italy, like ourselves, has been\r\nobliged to fight against Austria for her right to establish her\r\nnational union. At present both of us are living in peace with\r\nAustria, sharing with her the wish to ward off the dangers which are\r\nthreatening all alike. Together we wish to preserve the peace, which\r\nis as dear to the one as to the other, and to protect our\r\nhome--developments to which all of us are determined to devote\r\nourselves. It is these aims and the mutual confidence that the\r\ntreaties will be kept, and that no one will grow more dependent by\r\nthem than their own interests permit, which make these treaties firm,\r\ndurable and permanent!\r\n\r\nThe extent to which our treaty with Austria is the expression of our\r\nmutual interests was shown at Nikolsburg, and in 1870. Already during\r\nthe negotiations of Nikolsburg we were of the opinion that we could\r\nnot do for any length of time without Austria in Europe--a strong and\r\nvigorous Austria. In 1870, when the war between ourselves and France\r\nbroke out, many sensitive Austrians whom we had hurt were naturally\r\ntempted to make use of this opportunity and to take revenge for 1866.\r\nThe thoughtful and far seeing diplomats, however, of the Austrian\r\ncabinet had to ask themselves: \"What will be the result? What will be\r\nour position, if today we assist the French, and help them to beat\r\nPrussia, or even Germany?\" What would have been the result if France\r\nwith the help of Austria had been victorious over us? If Austria had\r\nfollowed such a policy, she could have had no other aim than to resume\r\nher former position in Germany: for this was really the only thing she\r\nhad given up in 1866. There had been no other important conditions,\r\nand the pecuniary ones had been insignificant. Well then, what would\r\nhave been the position of Austria as the presiding power in the German\r\nUnion, if she had to confess that in alliance with France she had\r\ntaken from Germany the left bank of the Rhine, that she had reduced\r\nthe south German states to a renewed dependence on France in the shape\r\nof a Rhenish Federation, and had condemned Prussia to an irrevocable\r\ndependence on Russia, subject in future to Russian policies?\r\nSuch a position was unacceptable to all Austrian statesmen not\r\ncompletely blinded by wrath and vengeance. The same is also true with\r\nus in Germany. Imagine Austria struck from the map of Europe. Then we\r\nand Italy would be isolated on the continent, hemmed in between Russia\r\nand France, the two strongest military powers next to Germany, either\r\ncontinually one against two--and this would be most probable--or\r\nalternately dependent on one or the other. But this will not be the\r\ncase. It is impossible to imagine Austria away, for a State like\r\nAustria does not disappear. It is estranged if it is jilted, as was\r\nproposed in the Villafranca negotiations, and will be inclined to\r\noffer the hand to him who, on his part, has been the opponent of an\r\nunreliable friend.\r\n\r\nIn short, if we wish to avoid being isolated, which is especially\r\ndangerous for Germany in our assailable position, we must have a\r\nreliable friend. Thanks to the similarities of our interests, and this\r\ntreaty before you, we have two such friends. It is not love which\r\nmakes them reliable, for nations may make war one upon the other\r\nbecause they hate, but it has never yet happened that one nation has\r\nsacrificed itself for the other for mere love. Nor do they always\r\nfight when they hate each other, for, if this were the case, France\r\nwould have to be fighting incessantly, not only with us, but also with\r\nEngland and Italy. She hates all her neighbors. I also believe that\r\nthe Russian hatred of us, which has been artificially fanned, will not\r\nlast. We are united with our allies in love of peace, not only by\r\ninclination and friendship, but also by the most cogent interests of a\r\nEuropean equilibrium and of our own future.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons I believe you will approve the Emperor's policy that\r\nhas concluded the published treaty, although it increases the\r\npossibility of war.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the passage of the pending bill will add\r\nmuch weight to the alliance which we have joined, and that the member\r\nwhich is represented by the German empire will be immeasurably\r\nstrengthened. The bill gives us an increase of trained troops, a\r\npossible increase of troops, which we need not summon, if we do not\r\nneed them. We can leave the men at home. But, having them in reserve,\r\nwe shall also have the arms for them, and this is the all-important\r\nthing. I remember the old blunderbuses furnished in 1813 for our\r\n_Landwehr_ by England, with which I was drilled in the _chasseurs_.\r\nThey were no weapons for war--such we cannot furnish at a moment's\r\nnotice. But, when once we have the proper weapons, this new bill means\r\nan increase of the guarantees of peace, and as strong an increase of\r\nthe league of peace as if a fourth great power had joined it with\r\n700,000 men, which as you know used to be the maximum figure of a\r\nnational army. This tremendous increase will also have a quieting\r\neffect, I believe, on our own people, and will somewhat alleviate the\r\nnervousness of our public opinion and of our bankers and editors. I\r\nhope you will be relieved when you realize that after this increase,\r\nand from the very moment this bill is signed and published, the men\r\nwill be ready. A scanty supply of arms for them might even now be at\r\nhand, but we must secure better ones, for if we form an army of\r\ntriarians, of the best human material which we have among our people,\r\nmen over thirty years of age and fathers of families, then we must\r\nhave for them also the best arms that can be secured. We should not\r\nsend them into battle with arms which we do not deem good enough for\r\nour regular troops. These staunch men, fathers of families, and\r\ngigantic figures, as we remember them from the time when they held the\r\nbridge of Versailles, should carry on their shoulders the best of\r\nguns, and have the most complete armor and necessary clothing to ward\r\noff the hardships of the weather and other ills. In such matters we\r\nmust not be saving.\r\n\r\nAfter listening to the survey of forty years which I have just given\r\nit is natural that our fellow-citizens should realize the ever-present\r\ndanger of a coalition against us and the possibility of a double\r\nattack, in which I, to be sure, do not believe. The thought,\r\nhowever, that in such a case we can have one million good soldiers for\r\nour defense on either frontier will be most reassuring to them. In\r\naddition, we can keep at home reserves of half a million and more, or\r\neven a million, sending them to the front as they may be needed. I\r\nhave been told: \"The result will be that the others will also increase\r\ntheir strength.\" This they cannot do, for they long ago reached their\r\nhighest figure. We decreased our figures in 1867, because we believed\r\nthat we could take things easy, with the North German Alliance at our\r\ndisposal, and could release from service all men over thirty-two years\r\nof age. Our neighbors subsequently adopted a longer period of service,\r\nmany one as long as twenty years. The minister of war will be able to\r\nexplain this to you more in detail, if he will address you. In figures\r\nthe others are as strong as we, but in quality they cannot equal us.\r\nCourage is the same with all civilized nations, the Russian or the\r\nFrenchman fights as bravely as the German; but our people, our 700,000\r\nmen, are experienced, _rompus au métier,_ trained soldiers who have\r\nnot forgotten anything.\r\n\r\nIn addition, no nation in the world can equal us in our material of\r\nofficers and subalterns to direct such a huge army. This means the\r\nremarkable degree to which popular education has spread in Germany,\r\nand which appears in no other country. The degree of education which\r\nis needed to qualify an officer and a subaltern to command according\r\nto what the soldiers expect of them, is found with us far more\r\nextensively than elsewhere. We have more of the material out of which\r\nofficers, and more out of which subalterns are made, than any other\r\ncountry, and we have a body of officers which no country in the world\r\ncan equal.\r\n\r\nThis, and the excellence of our subalterns, who are the pupils of our\r\nofficers, constitute our superiority. The other nations cannot equal\r\nus in the amount of education which qualifies an officer to fulfil the\r\nsevere requirements of his station, and of good comradeship to bear\r\nall the necessary privations, and at the same time to satisfy the\r\nexceedingly difficult social demands which must be met, if the\r\nfeeling of good fellowship between officers and men, which thank God\r\nexists in our army to a high and often stirring degree, is to be\r\nestablished without detracting from the authority of the officers. The\r\nrelations existing, especially in war time, between our officers and\r\nmen are inimitable,--with few evil exceptions which only prove the\r\nrule, for on the whole we may say: No German officer forsakes his men\r\nunder fire; he saves them at the risk of his life, and they do the\r\nsame; no German soldier forsakes his officer--we have experienced\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nIf other nations are obliged to furnish with officers and subalterns\r\nequally large troops as we are intending to create by this bill, they\r\nmay be forced by circumstances to appoint officers who will not\r\nsucceed in guiding a company through a narrow gate, and even less in\r\nmeeting the heavy obligations of the officer who is to retain the\r\nesteem and love of his men. The amount of education which is needed\r\nfor this, and the amount of _camaraderie_ and sense of honor which we\r\nfind among our officers, can be elicited from no other body of\r\nofficers anywhere in the world, either by rules or injunctions. In\r\nthis we are superior to everybody, and that is why they cannot imitate\r\nus. I am, therefore, not at all afraid of it.\r\n\r\nThen there is another advantage if this bill is passed. The very\r\nstrength at which we are aiming necessarily renders us pacific. This\r\nsounds like a paradox, but it is not.\r\n\r\nWith the powerful engine into which we are transforming the German\r\narmy one does not make an attack. If I were to come before you today,\r\non the assumption that conditions were different from what I believe\r\nthey are, and said, \"We are considerably menaced by France and Russia;\r\nit is to be expected that we shall be attacked, and as a diplomat,\r\nbelieving my military information in these matters to be correct, I am\r\nconvinced that it is better for us to have our defense consist of a\r\nbold attack, and to strike the first blow now;\" and if I added: \"We\r\ncan more easily wage an aggressive war, and I, therefore, am asking\r\nthe Reichstag for an appropriation of a milliard, or half a milliard,\r\nmarks to engage in a war against our two neighbors,\"--then I do not\r\nknow, gentlemen, whether you would have enough confidence in me to\r\ngrant my request, but I hope you would not have it.\r\n\r\nBut, if you had, it would not satisfy me. If we Germans wish to wage a\r\nwar with the full effect of our national strength, it must be a war\r\nwhich satisfies all who take part in it, all who sacrifice anything\r\nfor it, in short the whole nation. It must be a national war, a war\r\ncarried on with the enthusiasm of 1870, when we were foully attacked.\r\nI still remember the ear splitting, joyful shouts in the station at\r\nKöln. It was the same all the way from Berlin to Köln, in Berlin\r\nitself. The waves of popular approval bore us into the war, whether or\r\nno we wished it. That is the way it must be, if a popular force like\r\nours is to show what it can do. It will, however, be very difficult to\r\nprove to the provinces and the imperial states and their inhabitants\r\nthat the war is unavoidable, and has to be. People will ask: \"Are you\r\nso sure? Who can tell?\" In short, when we make an attack, the whole\r\nweight of all imponderables, which weigh far heavier than material\r\nweights, will be on the side of our opponents whom we have attacked.\r\nFrance will be bristling with arms way down to the Pyrenees. The same\r\nwill take place everywhere. A war into which we are not borne by the\r\nwill of the people will be waged, to be sure, if it has been declared\r\nby the constituted authorities who deemed it necessary; it will even\r\nbe waged pluckily, and possibly victoriously, after we have once\r\nsmelled fire and tasted blood, but it will lack from the beginning the\r\nnerve and enthusiasm of a war in which we are attacked. In such a one\r\nthe whole of Germany from Memel to the Alpine Lakes will flare up like\r\na powder mine; it will be bristling with guns, and no enemy will dare\r\nto engage this _furor teutonicus_ which develops when we are attacked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANTON VON WERNER WILLIAM I ON HIS DEATHBED]\r\n\r\nWe cannot afford to lose this factor of preëminence even if many\r\nmilitary men--not only ours but others as well--believe that today we\r\nare superior to our future opponents. Our own officers believe this to\r\na man, naturally. Every soldier believes this. He would almost cease\r\nto be a useful soldier if he did not wish for war, and did not believe\r\nthat we would be victorious in it. If our opponents by any chance are\r\nthinking that we are pacific because we are afraid of how the war may\r\nend, they are mightily mistaken. We believe as firmly in our victory\r\nin a just cause as any foreign lieutenant in his garrison, after his\r\nthird glass of champagne, can believe in his, and we probably do so\r\nwith greater certainty. It is not fear, therefore, which makes us\r\npacific, but the consciousness of our strength. We are strong enough\r\nto protect ourselves, even if we should be attacked at a less\r\nfavorable moment, and we are in a position to let divine providence\r\ndetermine whether a war in the meanwhile may not become unnecessary\r\nafter all.\r\n\r\nI am, therefore, not in favor of any kind of an aggressive war, and if\r\nwar could result only from our attack--somebody must kindle a fire, we\r\nshall not kindle it. Neither the consciousness of our strength, which\r\nI have described, nor our confidence in our treaties, will prevent us\r\nfrom continuing our former endeavors to preserve peace. In this we do\r\nnot permit ourselves to be influenced by annoyances or dislikes. The\r\nthreats and insults, and the challenges, which have been made have, no\r\ndoubt, excited also with us a feeling of irritation, which does not\r\neasily happen with Germans, for they are less prone to national hatred\r\nthan any other nation. We are, however, trying to calm our countrymen,\r\nand we shall work for peace with our neighbors, especially with\r\nRussia, in the future as well as in the past. When I say especially\r\nwith Russia, I express the opinion that France is offering us no\r\nassurances of success in our endeavors. I will, however, not say that\r\nthese endeavors are of no use. We shall never pick a quarrel, nor ever\r\nattack France; and in the many little incidents which the liking of\r\nour neighbors for spying and bribing has occasioned we have always\r\nbrought about a very courteous and amicable settlement. I should\r\nconsider it criminal if we were to enflame a great national war for\r\nsuch bagatelles. These are instances when one should say: \"The\r\ncleverer of the two will yield.\"\r\n\r\nI am referring, therefore, especially to Russia, and here I have the\r\nsame confidence of success which I expressed a year ago, and which\r\nthis liberal sheet printed in such large type, without any \"running\r\nafter,\" or as a German paper very vulgarly called it, \"Kow-towing\" to\r\nRussia. That time has passed. We no longer sue for love, either in\r\nFrance or in Russia! The Russian press and the Russian public opinion\r\nhave shown the door to an old powerful and reliable friend, which we\r\nwere. We do not force ourselves on anybody. We have tried to\r\nreestablish the old intimate relations, but we are running after\r\nnobody. This does not prevent us, however, from observing the\r\ntreaty-rights which Russia has with us; on the contrary, it is an\r\nincentive to us to do so.\r\n\r\nThese treaty rights comprise some which not all our friends recognize\r\nas such. I mean the rights concerning Bulgaria which we won for Russia\r\nin the Congress of Berlin, and which were not contested until 1885.\r\nThere is no question for me, who was instrumental in preparing the\r\ncongressional decisions, and who joined in signing them, that all of\r\nus were of the opinion at that time that Russia should have a\r\npredominating influence in Bulgaria, after the latter had renounced\r\nEast Roumelia, and she herself had given the modest satisfaction of\r\nreducing by 800,000 souls the extent of the territory under her\r\ninfluence until it included only about three million people.\r\n\r\nFollowing this interpretation of the Congress, Russia until 1885\r\nappointed the prince, a close relative of the imperial house, of whom\r\nat that time nobody believed, or could believe, that he would wish to\r\nbe anything but a faithful adherent of the Russian policy. Russia\r\nnominated the minister of war and a great many officers; in short it\r\nwas governing in Bulgaria. There was no doubt of this. The Bulgarians,\r\nor some of them, or the prince--I do not know which--were not\r\nsatisfied with it. A _coup d'état_ took place--a defection from\r\nRussia. Thus an actual condition has ensued which we are not called\r\nupon to remedy by a recourse to arms, but which cannot in theory alter\r\nthe rights which Russia took home from the Congress of Berlin. Whether\r\nthere will be difficulties, if Russia should wish to procure her\r\nrights by force, I do not know. We shall neither support nor counsel\r\nviolent means, nor do I believe that they are being contemplated--I am\r\nquite sure they are not. If, however, Russia should try her luck along\r\ndiplomatic lines, possibly by suggesting the intercession of the\r\nSultan, the suzerain of Bulgaria, I deem it the duty of a loyal German\r\npolicy to cling to the decisions of the Congress of Berlin, and to\r\ninterpret them as all of us, without an exception, interpreted them at\r\nthat time. The public feeling of the Bulgarians can alter nothing in\r\nthis, so far as I am concerned. Bulgaria, the tiny little country\r\nbetween the Danube and the Balkans is not an object of sufficient\r\nsize, I assure you, to attach to it any importance, or to push Europe\r\nfor its sake into a war, from Moscow to the Pyrenees, from the North\r\nSea to Palermo, when no one can foresee its end. After the war we\r\nwould conceivably not even know for what we had been fighting.\r\n\r\nI may, therefore, declare that the hostility against us shown in the\r\nRussian public opinion, and especially in the Russian press, will not\r\ndeter us from supporting, at Russia's request, any diplomatic steps\r\nshe may take to regain her influence in Bulgaria. I intentionally say,\r\nat her request. Formerly we have, at times, endeavored to fulfil her\r\nwishes when they had been only confidentially suggested, but we have\r\nseen that some Russian papers immediately tried to prove that these\r\nvery steps of the German diplomacy had been the most inimical to\r\nRussia. They actually attacked us for having fulfilled the wishes of\r\nRussia even before they had been expressed. We did this also in\r\nthe Congress of Berlin; but it will not happen again. If Russia will\r\nofficially request us to support with the Sultan, as suzerain of\r\nBulgaria, the steps which she may take in her desire to reëstablish in\r\nBulgaria conditions according to the decisions of the Congress, I\r\nshall not hesitate to advise His Majesty the Emperor to do so. Our\r\nsense of loyalty to our neighbor demands this, for we should cherish\r\nneighborly relations with him, let the present feelings be what they\r\nmay. Together we should protect the monarchical institutions which are\r\ncommon to both of us, and set our faces, in the interest of order,\r\nagainst all the opponents of it in Europe. Russia's monarch, moreover,\r\nfully understands that these are the duties of the allied monarchs. If\r\nthe Emperor of Russia should find that the interests of his great\r\nempire of one hundred million people demand war, he will wage it, I do\r\nnot doubt. But I do not believe that these interests can possibly\r\ndemand a war against us, nor do I believe that these interests demand\r\nwar at the present time at all.\r\n\r\nTo sum up: I do not believe in an immediate interruption of peace, and\r\nI ask you to discuss this bill independently of such a thought or\r\napprehension, looking upon it as a means of making the great strength\r\nwhich God has placed in the German nation fully available. If we do\r\nnot need all the troops, it is not necessary to summon them. We are\r\ntrying to avoid the contingency when we shall need them.\r\n\r\nThis attempt is as yet made rather difficult for us by the threatening\r\nnewspaper articles in the foreign press, and I should like to admonish\r\nthese foreign editors to discontinue such threats. They do not lead\r\nanywhere. The threats which we see made--not by the governments, but\r\nby the press--are really incredibly stupid, when we stop to reflect\r\nthat the people making them imagine they could frighten the proud and\r\npowerful German empire by certain intimidating figures made by\r\nprinter's ink and shallow words. People should not do this. It would\r\nthen be easier for us to be more obliging to our two neighbors. Every\r\ncountry after all is sooner or later responsible for the windows which\r\nits press has smashed. The bill will be rendered some day, and will\r\nconsist of the ill-feeling of the other country. We are easily\r\ninfluenced--perhaps too easily--by love and kindness, but quite surely\r\nnever by threats! We Germans fear God, and naught else in the world!\r\nIt is this fear of God which makes us love and cherish peace. If in\r\nspite of this anybody breaks the peace, he will discover that the\r\nardent patriotism of 1813, which called to the standards the entire\r\npopulation of Prussia--weak, small, and drained to the marrow as it\r\nthen was--has today become the common property of the whole German\r\nnation. Attack the German nation anywhere, and you will find it armed\r\nto a man, and every man with the firm belief in his heart: God will be\r\nwith us.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOUNT THE GUARDS AT THE WARTHE AND THE VISTULA!\r\n\r\nSeptember 16, 1894\r\n\r\nTRANSLATED BY EDMUND VON MACH, PH.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n[On September 16, 1894, when Bismarck was no longer chancellor, 2,200\r\nGermans from the province of Posen appeared in Varzin to thank him for\r\nhis devoted work in the service of the national idea, and to gather\r\ncourage from him in their fight against the Polish propaganda which\r\nhad gained strength under the new régime at court. The aged\r\nfarm-manager, Mr. Kennemann, was the leader and spokesman of the\r\nvisitors.]\r\n\r\nGentleman! First I must ask your indulgence, since for two days I have\r\nbeen upset by an unpolitical enemy called lumbago, an old acquaintance\r\nof mine for sixty years. I hope to get the better of him soon, and\r\nthen to be able to stand again fully erect. At present, I must\r\nconfess, I am hampered by him.\r\n\r\nI begin by replying to the words of the previous speaker with thanks\r\nfor the honor done me, addressing myself first of all to him, but then\r\nalso to you. The previous speaker is as old as I. We were both born in\r\n1815, and different walks of life have brought us together again here\r\nin Varzin after almost eighty years. The meeting gives me great\r\npleasure, although I have not run my course as safe and sound as Mr.\r\nKennemann. When I claim to be an invalid of hard work, he may perhaps\r\nclaim the same. But his work was possibly healthier than mine, this\r\nbeing the difference between the farmer and the diplomat. The mode of\r\nlife of the latter is less healthy and more nerve-racking. To begin\r\nwith, then, I am grateful to you, gentlemen, and I should be even\r\nmore grateful, if we were all to put on our hats. I have lost in the\r\ncourse of years nature's own protection, but I cannot well cover my\r\nhead if you do not do the same.\r\n\r\nI thank you that you have spared no exertion to show your national\r\nsentiments in this way. The exertion was considerable, a night in the\r\ntrain, a second night on the way back, insufficient meals, and\r\ninconveniently crowded cars. The fact that you have stood all this and\r\nwere not deterred by it attests the strength of your national feeling,\r\nwhich impelled you to bear witness to it here. That you did it here\r\ngreatly honors me, and I recognize in it your appreciation of my part\r\nin the work of establishing the conditions which we are enjoying in\r\nGermany today, after years of disunion. These conditions may be\r\nimperfect, but \"the best is the enemy of the good.\" At the time when\r\nwe shaped these conditions we never asked: \"What may we wish?\" but\r\n\"What must we have!\" This moderation in our demands for union was one\r\nof the most important preliminaries of success. By following this path\r\nwe have reached the results which have strengthened the pledge that\r\nyour home will remain united with the German empire and the kingdom of\r\nPrussia. The proportion, in the meanwhile, of Germans in the\r\nfoundation of our structure to the less reliable--I will not say\r\nloose--Polish element has become decidedly more favorable for the\r\nGermans. Our national figures are forty-eight million Germans and two\r\nmillion Poles; and in such a community the wishes of the two million\r\ncannot be decisive for the forty-eight million, as must be apparent,\r\nespecially in an age when political decisions are dependent on a\r\nmajority vote as a last resort. The forces which guarantee the union\r\nof these territories are strong enough both in the parliament and in\r\nthe army to assure it, and no one can doubt that the proper\r\nauthorities are ready to use these forces at the right time. No one\r\nmistakes the meaning, when the announcement is made from the highest\r\nquarters: \"Ere we shall yield again Alsace, our army will have to be\r\nannihilated\" (and words to this effect have been spoken). The same\r\nthing is true, to an even stronger degree, of our eastern frontier. We\r\ncan spare neither, Posen even less than Alsace, and we shall fight, as\r\nthe Emperor has said, to the last man, before we renounce Alsace, this\r\nprotection of our Southern states. Yet Munich and Stuttgart are not\r\nmore endangered by a hostile position in Strassburg and Alsace than\r\nBerlin would be endangered by a hostile position near the Oder. It\r\nmay, therefore, be readily assumed that we shall remain firm in our\r\ndetermination and sacrifice, if it should become necessary, our last\r\nman and the last coin in our pockets for the defense of the German\r\neastern frontier as it has existed for eighty years. And this\r\ndetermination will suffice to render the union between your province\r\nand the empire as positively assured as things can be in this world.\r\n\r\nWe confined our demands to what was necessary for our existence and\r\nwhat enabled the big European nation which we are to draw a free\r\nbreath. We did not include territories where German used to be spoken,\r\nwhen this had been largely due to a propaganda of the German courts.\r\nMore German used to be spoken in the East, North-east, and elsewhere\r\nthan today. Remember our ally, Austria, and how familiar German was\r\nthere in the days of Joseph II. and of the Empress Maria Theresa, when\r\nGerman was a greater force in parts of Hungary than it is or can be\r\ntoday. But, for everything we gave up in the shape of a linguistic and\r\noutward union, we have found rich compensation in the intensity of a\r\ncloser union. If the older gentlemen will think back to the time\r\nbefore Emperor William I., they will realize that the lack of love\r\namong the various German tribes was much greater at that time than it\r\nis today. We have made notable progress in this direction, and, when\r\nwe compare the unequivocal expressions of opinion from Bavaria and\r\nSaxony today with the familiar sentiments of earlier times, we must\r\nsay that Germany, which for the past one hundred years had lagged\r\nbehind the other people of Europe in national development, has rapidly\r\ncaught up with them. Forty years ago we were far behind all other\r\nnations in national feeling and love of one another. Today we are no\r\nlonger behind them.\r\n\r\nOur fellow-countrymen from the Rhine, from the Alpine lake and the\r\nSaxon Elbe are attached to one another in affectionate sympathy, not\r\nonly when they meet abroad, but also at home. A united people has been\r\ncreated in a remarkably short time. This proves that the medical cure\r\nwhich we employed, although it was of blood and iron, lanced only a\r\nsore, which had come to a head long ago, and that it gave us speedy\r\ncomfort and good health. God grant that the cure will be lasting and\r\nsubject to no change. How far reaching it is has been proved by the\r\ntestimonials which I have received since I gave up my office. They\r\nhave come from all people,--from Baden, Bavaria, Saxony, Suabia,\r\nHessen, and from all the districts of Prussia outside the provinces of\r\nFrederick the Great. These entirely voluntary manifestations, which\r\nwere arranged by no one, and which not infrequently came to me at\r\nrather inconvenient and inopportune times, have impressed me with the\r\nexistence of national harmony. Every one of them has given pleasure to\r\nmy patriotic heart, and has borne witness to a common feeling existing\r\nin all German races--this much I wished to say concerning the\r\nstability of the political and national union of your province today.\r\n\r\nWe often sing \"Firm is the stand of the faithful guards on the Rhine,\"\r\nbut they are standing equally firm at the Warthe and the Vistula. We\r\ncannot spare an acre of land in either direction, for the sake of\r\nprinciple if for nothing else. The previous speaker referred to the\r\nattempts which had been made, as a result of the movement of 1848, to\r\nshake loose the union in which we were then living in Prussia and\r\nGermany, and to disregard our boundary lines. These attempts of\r\nsatisfying the wishes of our Polish neighbors ended with the action\r\nof the Prussian general von Colomb, who closed the gates of Posen\r\nto the Polish troops which, in response to promises made in Berlin,\r\nhad been raised under the Prussian General von Willisen. We were\r\nobliged to conquer with Prussian troops, and in a bloody war, the\r\narmy of the insurgents who fought bravely and honorably. I wish to\r\nadd that even that war was not fought with the Polish people as such,\r\nbut with the Polish nobility and their following. I remember speaking\r\nto some Polish soldiers of the 19th regiment, I believe, in Erfurt\r\nat that time, that is in 1850, who called the opponents only\r\n\"_Komorniks\"_--the Polish word for \"contract-laborers.\" We should,\r\nthen, not deceive ourselves into believing that even today the number\r\nof those who are opposed to the two races in Posen and in West Prussia\r\nliving together peacefully is as large as statistics may claim.\r\n\r\nThis brings me to the second point touched upon by the previous\r\nspeaker, the two races living together peacefully. I believe that many\r\nof you have in your employ laborers and servants who speak Polish, and\r\nthat you are of the opinion that no danger comes from this lower\r\nsocial stratum of the population. Living together with them is\r\npossible, and no disturbance of the peace starts with them. They do\r\nnot promote any movements hostile to us. I do not even mention the\r\nfact that they are possibly of another race than the nobility, whose\r\nimmigration into the Slavic districts is lost in the obscure past. The\r\nstatistical numbers, therefore, of those opposed to a peaceful\r\ncommunion of both races must be lessened by the large number of\r\nlaborers and farmers. The lower classes are, in the bulk, satisfied\r\nwith the Prussian government, which may not be perfect always, but\r\nwhich treats them with greater justice than they were accustomed to in\r\nthe times of the Polish republic of nobles. They are satisfied with\r\nthis. It was not part of my programme that the commission on\r\ncolonization should pay special attention to small holdings of\r\nGerman-speaking settlers. The Polish peasants are not dangerous, nor\r\ndoes it make any difference whether the laborers are Polish or\r\nGerman. The chief thing was to create crown-lands among the big\r\nestates, and to rent them to men whom the State could permanently\r\ninfluence. The desire for quick sales and colonization emanated from\r\nother competent quarters than myself. It was impossible for me to\r\nsupervise these measures after I had instigated them.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties which I met in the forty years of my Polish diplomacy\r\ndid not start with the masses of Polish laborers and peasants, but\r\nwere, I believe, occasioned largely, if not exclusively, by the Polish\r\nnobility with the assistance of the Polish clergy. Perhaps this latter\r\nterm is too narrow, for I know of instances when German priests\r\nassisted in the Polish propaganda for the sake of peace. This is a\r\npeculiarity of our race--and I do not exactly wish to condemn it--that\r\nwe often place our religion above our nationality. The very opposite\r\nis true of our opponents, the Poles and the French people, who regard\r\ntheir nationality more highly than their religion. We are suffering\r\nfrom this habit. We possess, however, a certain material\r\ncounter-weight, provided the State government unreservedly supports\r\nthe German element. The religious element has great weight in the\r\nfamily circle and among women, especially the Polish women, whom I\r\nhave always greatly admired. The minister has a freer access to them\r\nthan the local governor or the judge. There will, however, always be a\r\npowerful weight in the scales, when the Prussian government exercises\r\nits influence with firm determination and so clearly that doubts for\r\nthe future are impossible. _Vestigia terrent!_ we may say, when with\r\n1848, no--not 1848, I mean 1831-32--the attention paid to the Polish\r\nnation became almost more pronounced in Germany than that given to the\r\nGerman element. Since then we have surely been able to register\r\nprogress in our politics. Now I must ask your indulgence for a moment\r\non account of my lumbago. (Voices: Sit down, Your Highness.) Sitting\r\ndown does not help me. I know this visitor from years of experience. I\r\nwas speaking of the possibility of having the two races living\r\npeacefully side by side. This is not impossible, for in Switzerland we\r\nsee three different nationalities--the German, Italian, and French\r\nSwiss--deliberate quietly and without bitterness on matters of joint\r\ninterest. In Belgium we see the Germanic Flemish form a united State\r\nwith the Gallic Walloons, and we perceive that it is possible under\r\ncircumstances to live peacefully together even with the Poles, when we\r\nremember East Prussia, where the Polish Masures, the Lithuanians, and\r\nthe Germans work together harmoniously. Because nobody has incited the\r\npeople there, no national ill feeling has appeared among them. It is\r\ntrue, to be sure, that the Catholic priest, with his peculiar\r\ninterests, is unknown there. But look at your neighbors in Upper\r\nSilesia. Have the two races not lived there in peaceful communion for\r\ncenturies, although the religious differences exist there also? What\r\nis it, then, that Silesia has not, and that has made it possible for\r\nus to live there, through centuries, in religious harmony? I am sorry\r\nto have to say it, it is the Polish nobility and the clergy of the\r\nPolish propaganda. The Polish nobles are, no doubt, very\r\ninfluential--more so with the Poles than the Germans--but the\r\nstatistical figures are much larger than the actual number of our\r\naggressive Polish opponents with whom we have to count.\r\n\r\nThe nobles are thinking of the time when they were all-powerful, and\r\nthey cannot give up the memory of conditions when they ruled the king\r\nas well as the peasants. The Polish nobles, however, are surely too\r\nhighly educated to believe that the conditions of the old Polish\r\nrepublic of nobles could ever return, and I should be astonished if\r\nthe Polish peasants knew the history of Poland so badly that they did\r\nnot recoil from the possibility of a return to the old state of\r\naffairs. The peasants must say to themselves that a \"wet year,\" as the\r\nfarmers put it, would be their lot if the nobles regained their power.\r\nAmong the national-Polish representatives that are elected, you\r\ngenerally meet only noblemen. At least I cannot remember having seen\r\na Polish farmer as a representative in the Reichstag or in the diet.\r\nCompare this with the election results in German districts. I do not\r\neven know whether there are Polish burghers in our sense of the word.\r\nThe middle classes in the Polish cities are poorly developed.\r\nConsequently, when we reduce our opponents to their proper size, we\r\ngrow more courageous in our own determination; and I should be very\r\nglad if I could encourage those who on their part are adding to the\r\nencouragement of the Polish nobles. I feel, gentlemen, that I am of\r\none mind with you, who have traveled the hard road hither. I have no\r\ninfluence with other elements, but we shall not give up hope in spite\r\nof all vicissitudes.\r\n\r\nThe address of the previous speaker also referred to vicissitudes and\r\nchanges. These changes have characterized our entire Polish policy,\r\nfrom 1815 till today. They took place whenever high Polish families\r\ngained influence at court. You all know the Radziwill family and its\r\ninfluence at the court of Frederick William IV. If we could make a\r\nmental test of the popular feeling of 1831 and of today, we should\r\nfind that the conviction has greatly increased that we have German\r\nfellow-countrymen in the Grand duchy of Posen. The former and, I am\r\ntempted to say, childish cult of the Poles as I knew it in my\r\nchildhood is no longer possible. Then we were taught Polish songs in\r\nour music lessons together with the Marseillaise, to be sure. The\r\nPolish nobleman, therefore, than whom God never created anything more\r\nreactionary, was here thrown into one pot with the French revolution,\r\nand liberalism was coupled with the cause of the Poles, because we\r\nwere lacking in political perspicacity. Such feelings were ingrained\r\nin our citizens at that time. I am thinking especially of the citizens\r\nof Berlin. If today you ask the opinion of your forty-eight million\r\nfellow-countrymen, and compare their views and those of the bulk of\r\nthe German army with the bugbear which had found lodging in German\r\nhearts at the time of Platen's Polish songs, you surely cannot\r\ndespair of further development. We may, you must agree, register\r\nprogress, although it is slow and there are lapses. It is like\r\nclimbing a sandy hill or walking in the lava of Mount Vesuvius. One\r\noften glides back, but on the whole one is advancing. Your position\r\nwill grow the stronger the more vigorously developed our sense of\r\nnationality will become. I ask of you, do not despair if there are\r\nclouds in the sky, especially in this rainy year which has saddened\r\nthe farmers. They will disappear, and the union of the Warthe and the\r\nVistula with Germany is irrefragable.\r\n\r\nFor centuries we have existed without Alsace-Lorraine, but no one yet\r\nhas dared to think of what our existence would be if today a new\r\nkingdom of _Poland_ were founded. Formerly it was a passive power.\r\nToday it would be an active enemy supported by the rest of Europe. As\r\nlong as it would not have gained possession of Danzig, Thorn, and West\r\nPrussia, and I know not what else the excitable Polish mind might\r\ncrave, it would always be the ally of our enemies. It indicates,\r\ntherefore, insufficient political skill or political ignorance if we\r\nrely in any way on the Polish nobles for the safety of our eastern\r\nfrontier, or if we think that we can win them to fight anywhere for\r\nGerman possessions, sword in hand. This is an Utopian idea. The only\r\nthing which we and you, gentlemen, can do under present conditions,\r\nand which we can learn from the Poles, is to cling to one another. The\r\nPoles, too, have parties, and used to show this even more\r\nunfortunately than we, but all their parties disappear as soon as a\r\nnational question is broached. I wish the same would come to be true\r\nof us, and that in national questions we would belong primarily, not\r\nto a party, but to the nation. Let us be of as divergent opinions as\r\nwe choose, but when in our eastern provinces the question arises:\r\n\"German or Polish,\" then let the party feuds be laid aside until, as\r\nthe Berliners say, \"After nine o'clock.\" Now is the time to fight and\r\nto stand together. This is just as it is in military matters--and I\r\nam glad to see among you many who have experience in such things.\r\nBefore joining an attack in war we do not ask: Shall we follow our\r\nprogressive or our reactionary neighbor? We advance when the drum\r\nbeats the signal, and so we should in national affairs forget all\r\nparty differences, and form a solid phalanx hurling all our spears,\r\nreactionary, progressive, and despotic alike, against the enemy.\r\n\r\nIf we agree on this--and the dangers of the future are compelling us\r\nto do so--we shall win our women and children for the same strict\r\nsense of nationality. And if our women are with us, and our youths, we\r\nare saved for all time. This is one of our present tasks, to give a\r\nnational education to our children. I am confident that the German\r\nwomen possess all the necessary qualifications for this task. I shall\r\nask you, therefore, to join me in a toast: The German Women in the\r\nGrandduchy of Posen! And may the German idea take an ever firmer hold\r\nin your country!\r\n\r\n\r\nLONG LIVE THE EMPEROR AND THE EMPIRE!\r\n\r\nApril 1,1895\r\n\r\nTRANSLATED BY EDMUND VON MACH, PH.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The eightieth birthday of Prince Bismarck was celebrated as a\r\nnational holiday everywhere in Germany. Not less than 5,250 youths\r\nfrom the universities and academies visited Friedrichsruh on April 1\r\nto bear witness, before the \"old man\" of Germany, to their love for\r\nthe emperor and the empire. After receiving a delegation from the\r\nfaculties of all the universities, Bismarck addressed the students as\r\nfollows:]\r\n\r\nGentlemen! I have just heard from the lips of your teachers, the\r\nleaders of higher education, an appreciation of my past, which means\r\nmuch to me. From your greeting, I infer a promise for the future, and\r\nthis means even more for a man of my years than his love of\r\napprobation. You will be able, at least many of you, to live according\r\nto the sentiments which your presence here today reveals, and to do so\r\nto the middle of the next century, while I have long been condemned to\r\ninactivity and belong to the days that are past. I find consolation in\r\nthis observation, for the German is not so constituted that he could\r\nentirely dismiss in his old age what in his youth inspired him. Forty\r\nand sixty years hence you will not hold exactly the same views as\r\ntoday, but the seed planted in your young hearts by the reign of\r\nEmperor William I. will bear fruit, and, even when you grow old, your\r\nattitude will ever be German-national because it is so today--whatever\r\nform our institutions may have taken in the meanwhile. We do not\r\nwilfully dismiss from our hearts the love of national sentiments; we\r\ndo not lose them when we emigrate. I know instances of hundreds of\r\nthousands of Germans from America, South Africa, and Australia who are\r\ntoday bound to the fatherland with the same enthusiasm which carried\r\nmany of them to the war.\r\n\r\nWe had to win our national independence in difficult wars. The\r\npreparation, the prologue, was the Holstein war. We had to fight with\r\nAustria for a settlement; no court of law could have given us a decree\r\nof separation; we had to fight. That we were facing a French war after\r\nour victory at Sadowa could not remain in doubt for anyone who knew\r\nthe conditions of Europe. It was, however, desirable not to wage this\r\nwar too soon nor before we had garnered to some extent the fruits of\r\nour North-German union. After the war had been waged everybody here\r\nwas saying that within five years we should have to wage the next war.\r\nThis was to be feared, it is true, but I have ever since considered it\r\nto be my duty to prevent it. We Germans had no longer any reason for\r\nwar. We had what we needed. To fight for more, from a lust of conquest\r\nand for the annexation of countries which were not necessary for us,\r\nalways appeared to me like an atrocity; I am tempted to say like a\r\nBonapartistic and foreign atrocity, alien to the Germanic sense of\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nConsequently since we rebuilt and enlarged our house according to our\r\nneeds, I have always been a man of peace, nor have I shrunk from small\r\nsacrifices. The strong man can afford to yield at times. Neither the\r\nCaroline Islands nor Samoa were worth a war, however much stress I\r\nhave always laid on our colonial development. We did not stand in need\r\nof glory won in battles, nor of prestige. This indeed is the\r\nsuperiority of the German character over all others, that it is\r\nsatisfied when it can acknowledge its own worth, and has no need of\r\nrecognition, authority, or privilege. It is self-sufficient. This is\r\nthe course I have steered, and in politics it is much easier to say\r\nwhat one should avoid than to say what one should do. Certain\r\nprinciples of honesty and courage forbid one to do certain things,\r\njust as the access to certain fields is interdicted in the army\r\nmaneuvers. But the decision as to what has to be done is a very\r\ndifferent matter, and no one can be sure of it beforehand, for\r\npolitics are a task which can be compared only to the navigation of\r\nunknown waters. One does not know what the weather will be or how the\r\ncurrents will flow, nor what storms will be raging. There is in\r\npolitics this additional factor of uncertainty that one is largely\r\ndependent on the decisions of others on whom one has counted and who\r\nhave failed. One never can act with complete independence. And, when\r\nour friends whose assistance we need, although we cannot guarantee it,\r\nchange their minds, our whole plan has failed. Positive enterprises\r\nare, therefore, very difficult in politics, and when they succeed you\r\nshould be grateful to God who has given His blessing, and not find\r\nfault with details which one or the other may regret, but accept the\r\nsituation as God has made it. For man cannot create or direct the\r\nstream of time. He can sail on it and steer his craft with more or\r\nless skill, be stranded and shipwrecked, or make a favorable port.\r\n\r\nSince we now have made a favorable port, as I conclude from the\r\npredominant although not unanimous opinion of my countrymen, whose\r\napproval is all we have worked for, let us be satisfied, and let us\r\nkeep and cherish what we have won in an Emperor and an empire as it\r\nis, and not as some individuals may wish it should be, with other\r\ninstitutions, and a little bit more of this or that religious or\r\nsocial detail that they may have at heart. Let us be careful to keep\r\nwhat we have, lest we lose it because we do not know how to appreciate\r\nit. Germany once was a powerful empire under the Carolingians, the\r\nSaxons, and the Hohenstaufens, and when she lost her place, five, yes\r\nsix hundred years passed before she regained the use of her legs--if I\r\nmay say so. Political and geological developments are equally slow.\r\nLayers are deposited one on the other, forming new banks and new\r\nmountains. But I should like to ask especially the young gentlemen:\r\nDo not yield too much to the German love of criticism! Accept what God\r\nhas given us, and what we have toiled to garner, while the rest of\r\nEurope--I cannot say attacked us, but ominously stood at attention. It\r\nwas not easy. If we had been cited before the European Council of\r\nElders before our French affairs were settled, we should not have\r\nfared nearly so well; and it was my task to avoid this if I possibly\r\ncould. It is natural that not everything which everybody wished could\r\nbe obtained under these conditions, and I mention this only to claim\r\nthe indulgence of those who are perfectly justified in expecting more,\r\nand possibly in striving for more. But, above everything, do not be\r\npremature, and do not act in haste. Let us cling for the present to\r\nwhat we have.\r\n\r\nThe men who made the biggest sacrifices that the empire might be born\r\nwere undoubtedly the German princes, not excluding the King of\r\nPrussia. My old master hesitated long before he voluntarily yielded\r\nhis independence to the empire. Let us then be thankful to the\r\nreigning houses who made sacrifices for the empire which after the\r\nfull thousand years of German history must have been hard for them to\r\nmake; and let us be thankful to science, and those who cultivate her,\r\nfor having kept alive on their hearths the fire of German unity to the\r\ntime when new fuel was added and it flamed up and provided us with\r\nsatisfying light and warmth.\r\n\r\nI would then--and you will say I am an old, conservative man--compress\r\nwhat I have to say into these words: Let us keep above everything the\r\nthings we have, before we look for new things, nor be afraid of those\r\npeople who begrudge them to us. In Germany struggles have existed\r\nalways, and the party schisms of today are naught but the echoes of\r\nthe old German struggle between the noble families and the trade\r\nunions in the cities, and between those who had and those who had not\r\nin the peasant wars, in the religious wars, and in the thirty years'\r\nwar. None of these far reaching fissures, which I am tempted to call\r\ngeological, can disappear at once. And should we not be indulgent with\r\nour opponents, if we ourselves do not desist from fighting? Life is a\r\nstruggle everywhere in nature, and without inner struggles we end by\r\nbeing like the Chinese, and become petrified. No struggle, no life!\r\nOnly, in every fight where the national question arises, there must be\r\na rallying point. For us this is the empire, not as it may seem to be\r\ndesirable, but as it is, the empire and the Emperor, who represents\r\nit. That is why I ask you to join me in wishing well to the Emperor\r\nand the empire. I hope that in 1950 all of you who are still living\r\nwill again respond with contented hearts to the toast\r\n\r\nLONG LIVE THE EMPEROR AND THE EMPIRE!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE OF MOLTKE\r\n\r\nBY KARL DETLEV JESSEN, PH.D.\r\n\r\nProfessor of German Literature, Bryn Mawr College\r\n\r\n\r\nTo relate, in detail, the story of the life of General-Fieldmarshal\r\nGraf Helmuth von Moltke--or, as we shall briefly call him,\r\nMoltke--means to give an account of that memorable phase of modern\r\nhistory, perhaps, so far as Europe is concerned, the most important of\r\nthe nineteenth century. This was the ascendency of Prussia, of her\r\nking and of her people, culminating in the unification and the\r\nconsolidation of most of the German states into one great empire, with\r\nall its realization of military and political power, of social,\r\neconomic, and, in a wide sense, of cultural eminence and efficiency.\r\nThe barest outlines, however, must suffice for the present purpose.\r\n\r\nMoltke was born at the threshold of the century the history of which\r\nhe so prominently helped to shape, on October 26, 1800, at Parchim in\r\nthe duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. On his father's side he descended\r\nfrom a family of the North German gentry which had come to various\r\ndegrees of prominence in some German as well as Scandinavian states.\r\nNo doubt he inherited the military instinct from this race of\r\nwarriors, statesmen, and landholders; a race the characteristic traits\r\nof which indicated the line along which he was bound to develop, the\r\nfield in which he was to manifest his greatest achievements. But there\r\nis just as little doubt that all the elements of character which\r\nexalted his military gifts and instincts into an almost antique\r\nnobility, simplicity, and grandeur--his dignity, purity, dutifulness,\r\nhis profound religious devotion, and sense of humor--came to him from\r\nhis mother, who was descended from an ancient patrician family of the\r\nlittle republican commonwealth, the once famous Hansatown of\r\nLübeck. How far the Huguenot strain may have influenced him, through\r\nhis paternal grandmother, is hard to tell, since we know but little of\r\nCharlotte d'Olivet.\r\n\r\nAfter the family had moved to Holstein, where his father failed to\r\nmake a success of an agricultural undertaking for which he seems to\r\nhave lacked fitness, young Moltke entered the Royal Danish Military\r\nAcademy as a cadet, and there passed his lieutenant's examination with\r\ndistinction; but he sought and found a commission under the Prussian\r\neagle. He entered the eighth grenadiers at Frankfort-on-the-Oder. A\r\nyear later, in 1823, he was sent to what is now called the War Academy\r\nin Berlin. Only by the closest economy and by some outside work,\r\npartly literary, as we shall see, he managed to get along with his\r\nexceedingly small officer's pay. He distinguished himself however so\r\nmuch that he became, successively, a teacher at the Division School\r\nand an active military geological surveyor, and finally was taken into\r\nthe General Staff of the Army. Becoming a first lieutenant in 1832, a\r\ncaptain in 1835, ahead of many of his comrades, he served exclusively\r\nin strategical positions. During the four years, 1835-39, he, with\r\nsome comrades, was in the Turkish dominions for the purpose of\r\norganizing and drilling the Turkish Army. He witnessed, as an active\r\nparticipant, the Turkish defeat by the insurgent Egyptians at Nisib on\r\nthe Euphrates, which was brought about by the indolent obstinacy of\r\nthe Turkish commander-in-chief. Like Xenophon, Moltke retreated toward\r\nand reached the Black Sea. At Constantinople he obtained honorable\r\ndismissal from the Sultan. After his return to Prussia he became chief\r\nof the General Staff of the Fourth Army Corps. In 1841 he married Mary\r\nBurt, a young relative who was partly of English extraction. The union\r\ndeveloped into an unusually happy married life, in spite of, or partly\r\nbecause of, their great difference in age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOLTKE ANTON VON WERNER]\r\n\r\nHis wife, by whom he had no issue, lived to see the beginning of his\r\ngreat achievements and fame, but died in 1868, before his proudest\r\ntriumph. Various commands led him to Italy, Spain, England, and Russia\r\nas adjutant of Prussian princes. In 1858 he was appointed chief of the\r\nGeneral Staff of the Prussian Army--the institution which he shaped\r\ninto that great strategical instrument through which were made\r\npossible, from a military point of view, the glorious successes of the\r\nthree wars--1864, 1866, 1870-71--and which has become the model of all\r\nsimilar organizations the world over.\r\n\r\nSide by side with the overtowering political achievement of Bismarck\r\nand the more congenial life work of Roon, the minister of war,\r\nMoltke's service to his country and his king stands unchallenged in\r\nhistorical significance. He has indelibly inscribed his name on the\r\ntablets of history as one of the world's greatest strategists. But he\r\ndid not lay down his work until extreme old age; in 1888, as he so\r\nsimply put it in his request for relief from duty, he resigned his\r\noffice, because he \"could no more mount a horse.\" He, however, still\r\nremained president of the Commission of National Defense and his last\r\nspeech in the German Reichstag, of which he had been a continuous\r\nmember since its establishment, he delivered on May 14, 1890. He died\r\non April 24, 1891. The nation felt that one of its great heroes had\r\npassed away.\r\n\r\nIn two congratulatory documents on the occasion of Moltke's ninetieth\r\nbirthday, Theodor Mommsen, the historian, has summed up the results of\r\nthe great soldier's life-work--in the address presented by the Royal\r\nPrussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin, and in the honorary tablet of\r\nthe German cities. These inscriptions may be found in Mommsen's _Reden\r\nund Aufsaetze_. Shortly after Moltke's death, in a commemorative\r\naddress at the same Academy, the historian and Hellenist Ernst Curtius\r\nreviewed Moltke's relations to historical science and his achievements\r\nin military science and in history. The Academy had appointed the\r\nFieldmarshal an honorary member in 1860 for his great achievements in\r\nthe military, geographical, and historical sciences. Professor\r\nCurtius in the address draws the outlines of Moltke's character as a\r\nstudent, and explains how he is indebted to the teachings of Karl\r\nRitter, the founder of scientific geography, how he clearly develops\r\nunder the influence of Niebuhr, Alexander von Humboldt, Leopold von\r\nBuch, and Erman, the physicist. He points out how Moltke, as historian\r\nand as an expert cartographer, introduces scientific spirit and work\r\ninto his great creation, the German General Staff. As a strategist,\r\nhowever, it remains to be said that he follows in the footsteps, puts\r\ninto practice and develops the methods of General von Clausewitz, the\r\nfirst mind who put war on an empirical and scientific basis. Moltke\r\nwas intimately acquainted with Gibbon through a nearly completed\r\nrendering into German of _The History of the Decline and Fall of the\r\nRoman Empire_, a translation which, unfortunately, never was printed\r\nand seems to be lost even in manuscript. As his favorite books and\r\nwriters Moltke mentions, among others, Littrow's _Astronomy,_ Liebig's\r\n_Agricultural Chemistry_, Clausewitz's _On War,_ Ranke, Treitschke,\r\nCarlyle. It appears, then, that his scientific equipment was of the\r\nmost solid sort, enabling him to make the most valuable contributions\r\nto knowledge.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to imagine to oneself Moltke breaking into tears,\r\neither of wrath or of despair, in great crises of his life, such as we\r\nknow to have been the case with Bismarck. There is a contrast between\r\nthese two men in their very makeup. There is tragedy in Bismarck's\r\nsoul, in its volcanic eruptiveness and its conflicts. He is nervously\r\nhigh-strung in the extreme, the very embodiment, in Karl Lamprecht's\r\nterminology, of the type of \"Reizsamkeit.\" He likes to listen to\r\nBeethoven's music and his sense of nature reveals him to be\r\nimpressionable, sensitive. His gamut of emotions and feelings, and\r\ntheir expression, is extraordinary. Moltke, on the other hand, appears\r\nto be always in harmony with himself, he is far less impulsive than\r\nhis great contemporary and friend. His feeling, always awake for\r\nnature, has no element of morbid and pathetic sentiment; in the\r\nearlier stages of its manifestation we see it slightly tinged by\r\nRomanticism. But he is at peace with nature, his great comforting\r\nmother. There is no sudden and surprising break in his mental or\r\nspiritual development. The ideal of the strategist, as antiquity saw\r\nit, appears to be consummated in his person. William James, himself an\r\nardent pacificist, well observed that in the modern soldier there is a\r\nmatter-of-factness far removed from the bluff and make-believe of\r\nmodern life in general. He might have chosen Moltke as the best type\r\nof this sort of warrior. But there was much more than this scientific\r\nand dutiful soldier; there was at bottom of Moltke's nature a fine\r\nsense of proportion, an artistic vein, and, not the least element, a\r\nChristian philosophy of life just as far removed from mere perfunctory\r\nindifferentism as from cocksure dogmatic bigotry and self-sufficiency.\r\nWe have striking evidence of this in the _Trostgedanken_, the\r\n_Consolatory Thoughts on the Earthly Life and a Future Existence_,\r\nwhich he laid down as the last literary utterance of his full and\r\neventful career. But this is not all; for most astonishing of all in\r\nthe richness of this well-rounded harmony of over ninety years of life\r\nis a lively source of humor, due more to endowment and inheritance\r\nfrom his mother than to her influence, as his letters to her bear\r\nwitness. When war is declared in 1870 he remarks that a new vitality\r\nhas entered his carcass, and, on the very eve of his demise, when in\r\nthe morning he had attended a session of the Upper House of the\r\nPrussian Diet, loyal to his work and task to the very last moment, he\r\nclosed the last and winning game of whist he played with the quotation\r\nof that grim bit of humor characteristic of Frederick the Great and\r\nhis soldiery: \"_Wat seggt hei nu to sine ollen Suepers_?\"\r\n\r\nIn Moltke, if in any one, the character of the man reveals the\r\ncharacter and style of his writing. Mommsen, in his address mentioned\r\nabove, characterizes him as \"the man who knew how to describe, as well\r\nas how to win, battles, the master of style in his rare speeches, the\r\nclever and sympathetic investigator of and writer on manifold ethnic\r\nlife, the scientific explorer of the regions on the rivers Tigris and\r\nEuphrates.\" It is obvious, though, that this mastery of style, this\r\nsuperb union of form and content, was not attained miraculously and\r\nfrom the start. Still, his first production, published in 1827, a tale\r\n(_Novelle_) in the style of Tieck and his followers, shows distinctive\r\ntalent, and a tendency toward brevity as well as adequacy of\r\nexpression, not to mention a sustained sense of harmony and\r\nproportion. The young lieutenant also published, anonymously, some\r\npoetry, and showed a clever hand in translating from foreign poets. It\r\nis a pity that most of these attempts are buried in inaccessible\r\nperiodicals and have never been republished. But he left the field of\r\npoetry and fiction, so far as we know, forever with his next work, the\r\nfirst published under his name and in pamphlet form, a work which,\r\nthough of genuine political interest and love, was at the same time\r\nintended to increase his income to the level of a living wage:\r\n_Holland and Belgium in their mutual relations; from their separation\r\nunder Philip II., till their re-union under William I_. He read more\r\nthan five thousand pages of sources for the preparation of this small\r\npamphlet. It was published in 1831, and followed within a year by\r\nanother one: _An account of the internal state of affairs and of the\r\nsocial condition of Poland_. Both writings, as in fact everything else\r\nfrom his pen since about 1830, had a more or less direct bearing on\r\nhis military vocation; since war, according to Clausewitz, is nothing\r\nbut the continuation of politics by other than diplomatic means.\r\n\r\nBut the height of his literary mastery is reached in 1841 by the\r\npublication of the _Letters on the condition and events in Turkey from\r\nthe years_ 1835 _till_ 1839, the matured fruit of those eventful and\r\nadventurous but, at the same time, constructive years in the Orient.\r\nThey have been likened to Goethe's _Italian Journey_. The comparison\r\nis justified by striking resemblances. Both works have resulted from\r\ndiaries and letters actually kept, Moltke's work, however, more\r\nfaithfully retaining and professing its formal nature. But the\r\nresemblance is much closer, arising, in the so-called inner form, from\r\na similarity of attitude, the same wide extent of interests which may\r\nbe briefly called \"kulturgeschichtlich,\" and, above all, the\r\nscientific concern in the country and its inhabitants, to which both\r\nbrought the most solid and methodical qualifications. It is true, the\r\nwealth of Italy, both of antiquity and of the Renaissance, in matters\r\nliterary and artistic, so exuberantly mirrored in Goethe's book of\r\ntravel, is not to be found in Moltke's work. But this lack is\r\ncounterbalanced by those portions dealing with historical events which\r\nMoltke actually experienced and even influenced; events, though then\r\nunsuccessful, as far as his intentions were concerned, yet important\r\nand significant for our own time, as the recent developments on the\r\nBalkan peninsula bear ample evidence. Both, Goethe as well as Moltke,\r\nare clever and artistic in handling pencil and brush as well as their\r\ndescriptive pen.\r\n\r\nAnd now the style, in the narrower sense. It is natural, limpid, free\r\nfrom all rhetorical flourishes and wordiness, placing the right word\r\nin the right place. Xenophon, Caesar, Goethe, come to mind in reading\r\nMoltke's descriptions, historical expositions, reflections. Bookish\r\nterms and unvisual metaphors, which occur in the preceding pamphlets,\r\nthough rarely enough, are entirely absent. The tendency toward\r\nmilitary brevity and precision is everywhere obvious. The omission of\r\nthe cumbersome auxiliary, wherever permissible, already\r\ncharacteristically employed in his tale, is conspicuous, as in all his\r\nwritings and letters. The words are arranged in rhythmical groups\r\nwithout falling into a monotonous sing song. Participial\r\nconstructions, tending toward brevity, are more in evidence than in\r\nordinary German prose. Sparingly, but with good reason and excellent\r\nhandling, periodic structure is employed. Still another point is\r\nsignificant, showing the writer to be of born artistic instinct. In a\r\nletter to his brother Ludwig, who was to take from Moltke's\r\noverburdened shoulders part of his laborious task of translating\r\nGibbon, he cleverly remarks on the exuberant use of adjectives by the\r\nhistorian as being sometimes more obscuring than elucidating, and he\r\nsimply advises the omitting of some. It is a pity that the translation\r\nseems to be lost, and with it an insight into Moltke's elaboration of\r\nhis style, which a translation would reveal better than original\r\ncomposition. In one respect these letters about Turkey were never\r\nequalled by Moltke. Henceforth, he turned absolutely matter-of-fact, a\r\nmilitary writer _par excellence_. Even in his letters those nice bits\r\nof humor and incidental manifestations of a subtle and fine nature\r\nsense grow scarcer and scarcer. There are two essays--_The Western\r\nBoundary_, and _Considerations in the Choice of Railway Routes_--both\r\npublished in the _Deutsche Vierteljahrsschrift_, in 1841, and 1843\r\nrespectively, that demonstrate this tendency toward specialization.\r\nThe bulk of his writings from then on falls into that technical series\r\nreserved for, and interesting chiefly to, the military man. Even his\r\nspeeches in the Reichstag, few and far between, considering the extent\r\nof years over which they are spread, with all their excellent\r\n\"Sachlichkeit,\" their directness and clearness, concern matters and\r\nproblems that affect, more or less directly, his comprehensive duties\r\nas chief intellect of the military organization of his country. So,\r\nquite naturally, we see him very reluctantly yield to a gentle but\r\npersistent pressure to use his great literary talent for setting down\r\nsome reminiscences from his life. He declined to publish personal\r\nmemoirs, however, saying: \"All that I have written about actual and\r\nreal things ('Sachliches') which is worth preserving is kept in the\r\narchives of the General Staff. My personal reminiscences are better\r\nburied with me.\" He had turned objective in the highest possible\r\ndegree, leaving behind all vanities and petty subjective points of\r\nview. But after his retirement he wrote, in 1887, on the basis of the\r\ngreat work on that subject by the General Staff and partly managed by\r\nhimself, that short _History of the Franco-German War of_ 1870-71,\r\nwhich his nation cherishes as a precious inheritance. It is \"sachlich\"\r\nthroughout. Starting with a brief reflection on the origin of modern\r\nwars he relates the events from the point of view of the directing\r\nchief of staff of the army, closing the whole by one impressive\r\nsentence: \"Strassburg and Metz, estranged from our country in times of\r\nweakness, had been regained, and the German Empire had come to a\r\nrenewed existence.\" The work is a consummation, in literary form, of\r\nhis motto \"Erst waegen, dann wagen!\" From the very threshold of his\r\ndeath we possess as the sum total of his philosophy of life those\r\nalready mentioned _Consolatory Thoughts on the Earthly Life and a\r\nFuture Existence_. From the point of composition and style these are\r\nhighly interesting because of the fact that, beside the final version,\r\nthree extant parallel versions show the gradual working out of form\r\nand thought.\r\n\r\nSomething remains to be said about Moltke the correspondent. The\r\nletters preserved or published fully justify his being ranked among\r\nthe best letter writers in German literature. Here, more than\r\nelsewhere, the subtle and finer characteristics of the man, the son,\r\nthe brother, the friend, the gentle and always kindly responsive\r\nnature of a thoroughly human and Christian soul are revealed. Above\r\nall, however, and side by side with Bismarck's noble letters to his\r\nfiancée and wife, stand Moltke's charming and devoted letters to Mary\r\nBurt von Moltke. I shall not venture to describe their wealth of\r\nsentiment, of charm, of love, of interest in matters big and small.\r\nOne of the long series, however, stands conspicuous among them; it is\r\naddressed to his fiancée, dated Berlin, February 13, 1842. Charming in\r\nits combination of a protective, paternal, and instructive attitude\r\nwith that of the lover and prospective husband, it is unique also\r\nbecause of the advice given about the gentle art of writing letters,\r\nan art in which the great modern strategist excelled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_LETTERS AND HISTORICAL WRITINGS OF MOLTKE_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE POLITICAL AND MILITARY CONDITIONS OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE IN 1836\r\n\r\nTRANSLATED BY EDMUND VON MACH, PH.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Moltke spent four years, from 1836 to 1839, in Turkey, and, as was\r\nhis habit, sent detailed accounts of his experiences to his family.\r\nAfter his return to Prussia, he collected his material, revised it,\r\nomitted all intimate family references, and published it under the\r\ntitle _Letters Concerning Conditions and Events in Turkey_. The book\r\ncontained sixty-seven letters. The following is the tenth letter,\r\ndated from Pera, April 7, 1836.]\r\n\r\nFor a long time it was the task of the armies of western Europe to set\r\nbounds to the Turkish sway. Today the powers of Europe seem anxious to\r\nkeep the Turkish state in existence. Not so very long ago serious\r\nconcern was felt lest Islam gain the upper hand in a great part of the\r\nWest, as it had done in the Orient. The adherents of the prophet had\r\nconquered countries where Christianity had been rooted for centuries.\r\nThe classic soil of the apostles, Corinth and Ephesus, Nicea (the city\r\nof synods and churches), also Antioch, Nicomedia, and Alexandria had\r\nyielded to their strength. Even the cradle of Christianity and the\r\ngrave of the Saviour, Palestine and Jerusalem, did homage to the\r\nInfidels, who held their possessions against the united armies of the\r\nwestern knights.\r\n\r\nIt was left to the Infidels to put an end to the long existence of the\r\nRoman Empire, and to dedicate St. Sophia, where Christ and the saints\r\nhad been worshipped for almost one thousand years, to Allah and\r\nhis prophet. At the very time when people were wrangling about\r\nreligious dogmas in Constance, when the reconciliation between the\r\nGreek and the Catholic churches had failed, and the defection of forty\r\nmillion people from the rule of the Pope was threatening, the Moslems\r\nadvanced victoriously to Steiermark and Salzburg. The noblest prince\r\nof Europe at that time, the Roman King, fled from his capital before\r\nthem; and St. Stephen in Vienna came near being turned into a mosque,\r\nlike St. Sophia in Byzantium.\r\n\r\nAt that time the countries from the African desert to the Caspian Sea,\r\nand from the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic, obeyed the orders of the\r\nPadisha. Venice and the German Emperors were registered among the\r\ntributaries of the Porte. From it three quarters of the coastlands of\r\nthe Mediterranean took their orders. The Nile, the Euphrates, and\r\nalmost the Danube had become Turkish rivers, as the archipelago and\r\nthe Black Sea were Turkish inland waters. And after barely two hundred\r\nyears this same mighty empire reveals to us a picture of dissolution\r\nwhich promises an early end.\r\n\r\nIn the two old capitals of the world, Rome and Constantinople, the\r\nsame means have been employed to the same ends, the unity of the dogma\r\nto obtain unrestricted power. The vicar of St. Peter and the heir of\r\nthe calif have fallen thereby into identical impotency.\r\n\r\nSince Greece has declared her independence, and the principalities of\r\nMoldavia, Wallachia, and Servia are offering only a formal recognition\r\nto the Porte, the Turks are as if banished from these, their own\r\nprovinces. Egypt is a hostile power rather than a subject country;\r\nSyria with her wealth, Adana (the province of Cilicia), and Crete,\r\nconquered at the cost of fifty-five attacks and the lives of seventy\r\nthousand Mussulmans, have been lost without one sword-thrust, the\r\nbooty of a rebellious pasha. The control in Tripolis, hardly\r\nrecovered, is in danger of being lost again. The other African states\r\nof the Mediterranean have today no real connection with the Porte;\r\nand France in her hesitation whether she should keep the most\r\nbeautiful of them as her own is looking to the cabinet of St. James\r\nrather than to the Divan at Constantinople. In Arabia finally, and in\r\nthe holy cities themselves, the Sultan has had no actual authority for\r\na long time.\r\n\r\nEven in those countries which are left to the Porte the supreme power\r\nof the Sultan is often restricted. The people on the banks of the\r\nEuphrates and the Tigris show little fidelity; the _Agas_ on the Black\r\nSea and in Bosnia obey the dictates of their personal interests rather\r\nthan the orders of the Padisha; and the larger cities at a distance\r\nfrom Constantinople are enjoying oligarchical municipal institutions,\r\nwhich render them almost independent.\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman monarchy, therefore, consists today of an aggregation of\r\nkingdoms, principalities, and republics which are kept together only\r\nby habit and the communion of the Koran. And if a despot is a ruler\r\nwhose words are law, then the Sultan in Constantinople is very far\r\nfrom being a despot.\r\n\r\nThe diplomacy of Europe has long engaged the Porte in wars which are\r\nnot in its interest, or has forced it to make treaties of peace in\r\nwhich it has lost some of its provinces. During all this time,\r\nhowever, the Ottoman Empire had to deal with an enemy at home who\r\nseemed more terrible than all the foreign armies and navies. Selim\r\nIII. was not the first Sultan to lose his throne and his life in his\r\nstruggle against the Janizaries, and his successor preferred the\r\ndangers of a reformation to the necessity of trusting himself to this\r\nsociety. Through streams of blood he reached his end. The Turkish\r\nSultan gloried in the destruction of the Turkish army, but he had to\r\ncrave the help of an all-too-powerful vassal in order to suppress the\r\ninsurrection on the Greek peninsula. At this juncture three Christian\r\npowers forgot their ancient feuds. France and England sacrificed their\r\nships and men to destroy the Sultan's fleet, and thus laid open to\r\nRussia the way to the heart of Turkey, and brought about what they\r\nhad most wished to avoid.\r\n\r\nThe country had not yet recovered from these many wounds, when the\r\nPasha of Egypt advanced through Syria, threatening destruction to the\r\nlast descendant of Osman. A newly levied army was sent against the\r\ninsurgents, but the generals fresh from the harem led it to\r\ndestruction. The Porte applied to England and France, who were calling\r\nthemselves its oldest and most natural allies, but received from them\r\nonly promises. At this juncture Sultan Mahommed invoked the help of\r\nRussia, and his enemy sent him ships, money, and an army.\r\n\r\nThen the world saw the remarkable spectacle of fifteen thousand\r\nRussians encamped on the Asiatic hills overlooking Constantinople,\r\nready to protect the Sultan in his seraglio against the Egyptians.\r\nAmong the Turks dissatisfaction was rampant. The Ulemas saw their\r\ninfluence wane; the innovations had hurt countless interests, and the\r\nnew taxes incommoded all classes. Thousands of Janizaries, who were no\r\nlonger permitted to call themselves such, and the relatives and\r\nfriends of thousands of others who had been throttled, drowned, or\r\nshot down, were scattered through the country and the capital. The\r\nArmenians could not forget the persecution which they had recently\r\nsuffered, and the Greek Christians, who constituted half of the\r\npopulace of the original Turkish empire, looked upon their rulers as\r\ntheir enemies, and upon the Russians as fellow-believers in the same\r\nreligion. Turkey at that time could not raise another army.\r\n\r\nAnd just then France was laboring with her great event, England was\r\ncarrying a load in her public debts, while Prussia and Austria had\r\nattached themselves more intimately than ever before to Russia,\r\ncompelled to do so by the conditions of Western Europe.\r\n\r\nForeign armies had brought the empire to the brink of destruction; a\r\nforeign army had saved it. For this reason the Turks wished above\r\neverything else to possess an army of their own of seventy thousand\r\nregular troops. The inadequacy of this force for the protection of the\r\nextensive possessions of the Porte is apparent after one glance at the\r\nmap. The very dimensions preclude the concentration of the troops,\r\nscattered through so many places, when one particular spot is in\r\ndanger. The soldiers in Bagdad are 1,600 miles distant from those at\r\nUshkodra in Albania.\r\n\r\nThis shows the great importance of establishing in the Ottoman Empire\r\na well arranged system of militia. It presupposes, of course, that the\r\ninterests of those who rule and those who are ruled are not at\r\nvariance.\r\n\r\nThe present Turkish army is a new structure on an old and battered\r\nfoundation. At present the Porte would have to look for its safety to\r\nits treaties rather than to its army; and the battles which will\r\ndecide the survival of this State may as well be fought in the\r\nArdennes or in the Waldai Mountains as in the Balkans.\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman monarchy needs above everything else a well ordered\r\nadministration, for under present conditions it will scarcely be able\r\nto support even this weak army of seventy thousand men.\r\n\r\nThe impoverished condition of the country shows only too clearly in\r\nthe lessened income of the State. In vain a number of indirect taxes\r\nhave been introduced. A kind of tax on meat and meal is levied in a\r\nvery primitive way on the street corners of the capital. The fishermen\r\npay 20 per cent, of the catch in their nets. Weights and measures must\r\nbe stamped anew every year; and all products of industry, from\r\nsilverware and shawls to shoes and shirts, are stamped with the\r\nimperial seal. But the proceeds from these taxes are enriching only\r\nthose who collect them. The riches melt before the avaricious eye of\r\nthe administration, and the ruler of the most beautiful lands in three\r\ncontinents is drawing water with the leaky pots of the daughters of\r\nDanaus.\r\n\r\nFor the payment of its necessities the government must rely on the\r\nconfiscation of property, as it passes to new heirs or outright, on\r\nthe sale of offices, and finally on presents and the miserable means\r\nof adulterating the currency.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the confiscation of money inherited by State officials,\r\nthe present Sultan has declared that he will do without it. This\r\nedict, however, instead of abolishing the practice, acknowledges the\r\ncorrectness of the principle. Formerly the edicts of confiscation were\r\naccompanied by the death warrants of those who were to be robbed.\r\nToday there are gentler means in use for relieving people of the\r\nsurplus of their wealth.\r\n\r\nThe sale of offices continues to be the chief source of income of the\r\nState. The candidates borrow the money at a high rate of interest from\r\nsome Armenian business house, while the government permits these\r\n\"lease-holders\" to recoup themselves by the exploitation of their\r\nprovinces to whatever extent they wish. Withal, they must fear either\r\na higher bidder, who leaves them no time to get rich, or the State, if\r\nthey happen to have grown rich. The provinces know beforehand that the\r\nnew pasha has come to rob them. They, therefore, prepare themselves.\r\nInterviews are held, and if no agreement is reached, war is waged, or\r\nif an agreement is broken a revolution takes place. As soon as the\r\npasha has settled with the _Agas_, he stands in fear of the Porte. He,\r\ntherefore, combines with other pashas for mutual protection, and the\r\nSultan must negotiate with the future neighbors of a new pasha before\r\nhe can appoint him. In a very few _pashaliks_, to be sure, the\r\nbeginning of a better order of things has been made, the\r\nadministrative and military powers have been separated, and the\r\ntaxpayers themselves have agreed to higher taxes, provided they are\r\npermitted to pay them directly into the State treasury.\r\n\r\nPresents are as customary here as everywhere in the Orient. Without a\r\npresent the man of lower station is not permitted to approach his\r\nsuperior. If you ask justice of a judge you must take him a gift.\r\nOfficials and officers in the army are given tips, but the man who\r\nreceives most presents is the Sultan himself. The expedient of\r\nadulterating the currency has been used to the point of exhaustion.\r\nTwelve years ago the Spanish dollar was worth seven piasters; today it\r\nis bought for twenty-one. The man who then possessed one hundred\r\nthousand dollars has discovered that today he has only thirty-three\r\nthousand. This calamity has hit Turkey worse than it would have\r\naffected any other country, because very little money is here invested\r\nin land, and most fortunes consist of cash capital. In the civilized\r\ncountries of Europe a fortune is the result of having created\r\nsomething of real worth. The man who wins his wealth in this way is\r\nincreasing at the same time the wealth of his State. His money merely\r\nrepresents the abundance of goods at his disposal. In Turkey the coin\r\nitself is the thing of value, and wealth is nothing but the accidental\r\naccumulation of money within the possession of an individual. The very\r\nhigh rate of interest, which is here legally 20 per cent, is far from\r\nindicating any great activity of capital. It only indicates the great\r\ndanger of letting money out of one's immediate possession. The\r\ncriterion of wealth is the ease of its removal. The _Rajah_ will\r\nprobably buy jewelry for one hundred thousand piasters in preference\r\nto investing his money in a factory, a mill, or a farm. Nowhere is\r\njewelry better liked than here, and the jewels which, in rich\r\nfamilies, even children of tender years are wearing are a glaring\r\nproof of the poverty of the country.\r\n\r\nIf it is one of the first duties of every government to create\r\nconfidence, the Turkish administration leaves this task entirely\r\nunperformed. Its treatment of the Greeks, its unjust and cruel\r\npersecution of the Armenians, those faithful and rich subjects of the\r\nPorte, and other violent measures, are so fresh in everyone's memory\r\nthat no one is willing to invest his money where it will pay interest\r\nonly after many years. In a country where industry is without the\r\nelement on which it thrives, commerce also must largely consist of the\r\nexchange of foreign merchandise for raw home products. The Turk\r\nactually gives ten _occas_ of his raw silk for one _occa_ of\r\nfabricated silk, the material for which is produced on his own soil.\r\n\r\nAgriculture is even in a worse state. One often hears the complaint\r\nthat the cost of all the necessities of life has increased in\r\nConstantinople fourfold since the annihilation of the Janizaries, as\r\nif heaven had decreed this punishment on those who exterminated the\r\n\"soldiers of Islam.\" The fact, while true, should probably be\r\nexplained differently, for, since the events referred to, the great\r\ngranaries of the capital, Moldavia, Wallachia, and Egypt, which\r\nformerly had to send half of their harvests to the Bosphorus, have\r\nbeen closed. In the interior nobody will undertake the growing of\r\ngrain on a large scale, because the government makes its purchases\r\naccording to prices of its own choosing. The forced purchases by the\r\ngovernment are a greater evil for Turkey than her losses by fire and\r\nthe plague combined. They not only undermine prosperity, but they also\r\ncause its springs to dry up. As a result the government must buy its\r\ngrain in Odessa, while endless stretches of fertile land, under a most\r\nbenignant sky and at only an hour's distance from a city of eight\r\nhundred thousand people, lie untilled.\r\n\r\nThe outer members of this once powerful political body have died, and\r\nthe heart alone has life. A riot in the streets of the capital may be\r\nthe funeral procession of the Ottoman Empire. The future will show\r\nwhether it is possible for a State to pause in the middle of its fall\r\nand to reorganize itself, or whether fate has decreed that the\r\nMohammedan-Byzantine Empire shall die, like the Christian-Byzantine\r\nEmpire, of its fiscal administration. The peace of Europe, however, is\r\napparently less menaced by the danger of a foreign conquest of Turkey\r\nthan by the extreme weakness of this empire, and its threatened\r\ncollapse within itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TRIP TO BRUSSA\r\n\r\nTRANSLATED BY EDMUND VON MACH, PH.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n[This is the fourteenth of the Letters Concerning Conditions and\r\nEvents in Turkey. It is dated from Pera, June 16, 1836.]\r\n\r\nYesterday I returned from a short excursion to Asia, which I really\r\nshould describe for you in poetry, because I ascended Mount Olympus.\r\nBut since I did not reach the summit, and did not climb farther than\r\nthe foot, or more properly speaking the toe, of the giant you will get\r\noff with prose.\r\n\r\nI embarked on the eleventh, in the afternoon, in a small Turkish\r\nvessel, and a fresh north wind carried us in four hours to the rocky\r\npromontory of Posidonium (today Bosburun, the point of ice), a\r\ndistance of eight miles. Here the sea was running very high, and our\r\n_reis_, or helmsman, who was squatting on the high and delicately\r\ncarved stern of the ship, was beginning to chant his _Allah\r\nekber_--God is merciful--when the wind died down so completely toward\r\ndusk that we did not reach Mudania before eight o'clock next morning.\r\n\r\nThe horses were soon ready, and up to Brussa I passed through a\r\ncountry that was doubly charming after the lonesomeness of Roumelia,\r\nwhich had been all I had seen for six months. Everything is under\r\ncultivation, planted less with corn than with vines and mulberry\r\ntrees. The latter, which serve as food for the silkworms, are trimmed\r\nlow like bushes, with the crowns cut off, as we do with willows. Their\r\nlarge bright green leaves cover the fields far and wide. The olive\r\ntrees grow here in groves of no mean size, but they have to be\r\nplanted. The whole richly cultivated country reminds one of Lombardy,\r\nespecially of the hilly landscape near Verona The distant view is as\r\nmagnificent as the foreground is lovely. On one side you see the Sea\r\nof Marmora and the Princess Islands, and on the other the glorious\r\nMount Olympus, whose snow-clad peak rises above a broad girdle of\r\nclouds. The flowering vineyards filled the air with rich scent,\r\nassisted by caprifolium blossoms in luxuriant growth, and a yellow\r\nflower the name of which I do not know.\r\n\r\nWhen we had crossed a ridge of low hills, we saw Brussa stretched out\r\nbefore us in a green plain at the foot of Mt. Olympus. It is indeed\r\ndifficult to decide which one of the two capitals of the Ottoman\r\nrulers is more beautifully situated, the oldest or the newest, Brussa\r\nor Constantinople. Here the sea and there the land bewitches you. One\r\nlandscape is executed in blue, the other in green. Relieved against\r\nthe steep and wooded slopes of Mt. Olympus, you see more than one\r\nhundred white minarets and vaulted domes.\r\n\r\nThe mountain rises to the regions of almost perpetual snow, and\r\nsupplies the inhabitants of Brussa with wood to warm themselves in\r\nwinter and with ice for their sherbet in summer. A river, called\r\nLotos, winds its course through rich meadows and fields of mulberry\r\ntrees, where giant nut trees with dark foliage and light green planes,\r\nwhite minarets and dark cypress trees rise to the sky. Vines climb up\r\nthe mighty trunks and attach themselves to the branches, whence they\r\ndroop again to earth, while Caprifolium plants and thriving creepers\r\nsuperimpose themselves on the vines. Nowhere have I seen such a wide\r\nand thoroughly green landscape, except from the tower of Lübbenau,\r\noverlooking the woods along the Spree. But here you have in addition\r\nthe richer vegetation and the glorious mountains which surround the\r\nplain. The abundance of water is surprising; everywhere brooks are\r\nrushing along and springs are gushing from the rocks, ice cold and\r\nboiling hot, side by side. In every part of the city, even in the\r\nmosques, water is bubbling from countless fountains.\r\n\r\nAs is the case with all Turkish cities, the beautiful picture vanishes\r\nthe moment you enter Brussa. The smallest German town surpasses\r\nConstantinople, Adrianople, or Brussa in the charm of its buildings\r\nand still more in comfort. Only the mosques and the _Hanns_, or\r\ncaravansaries, the fountains and public baths are magnificent. In the\r\nearlier times of the Ottoman monarchy no ruler was permitted to build\r\na mosque before he had won a battle against the infidels. The mosques\r\nin Brussa are smaller and less beautiful than those which were built\r\nlater, but they possess the added interest of historical memories.\r\nThere you find such names as Orchan, Suliman, Murad, in short, all the\r\nheroes of the victorious period of Islam.\r\n\r\nThe mosque of Bajasid attracted me most because of its excellent\r\narchitecture. Bajasid is the man whom the Turks call Ilderim, or the\r\nLightning. The monument of the mighty conqueror, who himself was\r\nconquered and died in a cage according to the legend, stands alone in\r\nthe shadow of mighty cypress trees. The largest of the mosques used to\r\nbe a Christian cathedral. It is lighted from above, the middle vault\r\nhaving been left open. The beautiful Asiatic starry sky itself has\r\nbecome its vault. The opening is covered with a wire screen, and below\r\nit in a wide basin a fountain is playing.\r\n\r\nI will not say that even the largest mosques, the Sultan Selim, for\r\ninstance, in Adrianople, or Sulamanich in Constantinople, make the\r\nsame impression or inspire the same reverence as St. Stephan's in\r\nVienna, or the cathedrals of Freiburg and Strassburg. But every\r\nmosque, even the smallest, is beautiful. There is nothing more\r\npicturesque than the semi-circular, lead-covered domes and the\r\nslender, white minarets rising above the mighty planes and cypresses.\r\nWhen the Ottomans conquered the provinces of the Eastern Roman Empire\r\nthey preserved the Greek Church architecture, but they added the\r\nminarets, which are of Arabian origin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COUNT MOLTKE]\r\n\r\nThe _Hanns_ are the only stone dwelling-houses to be found. They are\r\nbuilt in the shape of rectangles with an open court. Here, at least in\r\nthe larger ones, you will find a mosque, a fountain, a small kiosk for\r\nnoble travelers, and a few mulberry trees or plane trees. All about\r\nthe court there is a colonnade with pointed arches; and, beyond that,\r\nrows of cells, each one with its individual vault. A mattress of straw\r\nis the only furniture for the traveler, who finds neither service nor\r\nfood in these _Hanns_.\r\n\r\nWe dined in thoroughly Turkish fashion at the _Kiebabtshi_. After our\r\nhands had been washed we sat down, not at but on the table, where my\r\nlegs were terribly in the way. Then the _Kiebab_, or small piece of\r\nmutton, broiled on the spit and rolled in dough, was served on a\r\nwooden platter. It is very good and tasty. It was followed by salted\r\nolives, which are wonderful, by the _helva_, i. e., the favorite sweet\r\ndish, and by a bowl of sherbet. This consists of water poured over\r\ngrapes and thoroughly iced. The whole dinner for two hearty eaters\r\ncost one hundred and twenty paras, or five shillings.\r\n\r\nThe comforts of the Turkish baths I have described to you in an\r\nearlier letter. The baths of Brussa are distinguished, because they\r\nare not artificially but naturally heated, and so much so that you\r\nwould not think it possible, at first, to enter the great basin of\r\nclear water without being parboiled before you could leave it again.\r\nFrom the terrace of our bath we had a beautiful view, and it was so\r\ncomfortable there that we hated to leave.\r\n\r\nOn the thirteenth we rode to Kemlik, at the end of the Bay of Mudania,\r\nwhere there is a dockyard. This is the most beautiful spot I have\r\nseen. The clear surface of the sea is lost here between the high and\r\nsteep mountains, which leave just enough space for the little town and\r\nthe olive woods. Twilight is very brief in this country, and night had\r\ncome when we reached the town gate, but what a night! Although the\r\nmoon happened to be new, objects were distinguishable at a\r\nconsiderable distance, while the evening star shines here so brightly\r\nthat shadows are cast by its light.\r\n\r\nAt three o'clock in the morning we were again in the saddle, riding\r\ntoward the East through a valley and between high mountains, along the\r\nsame road which Walther von Habenichts once followed with his twelve\r\nthousand crusaders. The hills were covered with olive trees and\r\nflowering bushes filled with nightingales. At sunset we reached the\r\nextensive lake of Isnik. The gigantic walls and towers on the opposite\r\nshore used to protect a powerful city, for which the crusaders often\r\nfought. Today they surround the few miserable huts and rubbish heaps\r\nwhich centuries ago were Nicea. It was here that an assembly of one\r\nhundred learned bishops expounded the mystery of the Trinity, and\r\ndecided to burn all who held a different view. What would these proud\r\nprelates have said if a man had prophesied to them that the time would\r\ncome when their rich and mighty city would be a rubbish heap, and\r\ntheir cathedral the ruins of a Turkish mosque; when the empire of the\r\nGreek emperors would be destroyed, and their own exegesis, yes, even\r\ntheir entire religion, would have disappeared from these parts, and\r\nwhen for hundreds of miles and through hundreds of years the name of\r\nthe camel-driver of Medina would be the only one in the mouths of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe Moslems, who abhor all pictures, have covered with whitewash the\r\npaintings in the Greek churches. In the Cathedral of Nicea, where the\r\nfamous council was held, there glistens even today through the white\r\ncoating of the wall, where the high altar used to be, the proud\r\npromise, I.H.S. (_in hoc signo_, i. e., under this sign, the cross,\r\nyou will win). But directly over it is written the first dogma of\r\nIslam, \"There is no God but God.\" There is a lesson of tolerance in\r\nthese faded inscriptions, and it seems as if Heaven itself wished to\r\nlisten as well to the _Credo_ as to the _Allah il allah_. One of the\r\nchief pursuits of the honest Turks is what they call _Kief etmek_,\r\nliterally \"creating a mood.\" It consists of drinking coffee in a\r\ncomfortable place and smoking. Such a place _par excellence_ I found\r\nin the village where we made a stop. Imagine a plane which extends its\r\ncolossal branches horizontally for almost one hundred feet, burying in\r\nits deep shadow the nearest houses. The trunk of the tree is\r\nsurrounded by a small terrace of stone, below which water is gushing\r\nfrom twenty-seven pipes in streams as thick as your arm, and rushing\r\noff as a lively brook. Here, with their legs crossed, the Turks sit,\r\npractising--silence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA JOURNEY TO MOSSUL\r\n\r\nTRANSLATED BY EDMUND VON MACH, PH.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n[This is the forty-third letter of Moltke's Letters from Turkey, and\r\nis dated from Dshesireh on the Tigris, May 1, 1838.]\r\n\r\nI told you in my last letter that we should be going on an expedition\r\nagainst the Arabs. This did not materialize. Nevertheless, I had the\r\nopportunity of making the acquaintance of a very interesting part of\r\nthe country. On April 15, von Mühlbach, I, and two fully armed _agas_\r\nof the pasha, together with our servants and dragomans, embarked on a\r\nvessel built in a style well known even in the times of Cyrus, a raft\r\nsupported by inflated sheep-skins. The Turks look upon hunting as a\r\nsin, they despise venison and beef, but eat an enormous quantity of\r\nsheep and goats. The skins of these animals are cut in front as little\r\nas possible and removed from the carcass with great care. Then they\r\nare sewed up and the extremities tied up. When the skin is inflated\r\n(which is done quickly and without touching the skin to the mouth) it\r\nis exceedingly buoyant and can hardly be made to sink. From forty to\r\nsixty such bags are tied together in four or five rows under a light\r\nframework of branches. There generally are eight skins in front and\r\neighteen in the back. The whole is covered with a litter of leaves\r\nover which rugs and carpets are spread. Taking your seat on these you\r\nglide downstream with utmost comfort. Because the current is swift,\r\noars are not needed for progress, but only for steering the raft,\r\nkeeping it in the middle of the course, and avoiding the dangerous\r\nrapids. On account of these rapids we had to tie up every night\r\nuntil the moon was up, but in spite of this we covered the distance,\r\nwhich by land would have taken us eighty-eight hours, in three and\r\none-half days. The river, therefore, must flow with an average\r\nvelocity of almost four miles per hour. In places it is much swifter,\r\nand in others decidedly slower.\r\n\r\nThe Tigris leaves the mountains near Argana-Maaden, and flows past the\r\nwalls of Diarbekir, where it is apt to cause slight inundations in\r\nsummer time. It then receives the Battman river flowing in a southerly\r\ndirection from the high Karsann-Mountains and carrying more water into\r\nthe Tigris than this river contained before. Immediately after the\r\nunion of these two rivers the Tigris enters another mountainous\r\nterritory formed of sandstone. The gentle curves of the broad and\r\nshallow river are transformed into the sharp criss-cross angles of a\r\nravine. The banks are abrupt, often vertical on both sides; and on top\r\nof some steep, rocky slopes your eye may discover groves of dark-green\r\npalms, and in their shadows the settlements of tribes of Kurds, who in\r\nthis region are mostly cave-dwellers.\r\n\r\nThe town of Hassn-Kejfa (Hossu-Keifa), situated on a high rock whence\r\na narrow staircase descends to the river, offers a most unusual\r\naspect. The old city below has been destroyed, and only a few minarets\r\nstill pointing to the sky indicate that mosques and houses once stood\r\nhere. The inhabitants were obliged to retreat to the top of the cliff,\r\nwhere they built a wall of defence on the only accessible side. In the\r\nnarrow ravine I discovered huge blocks which had rolled down from\r\nabove. People have hollowed them and are using them as dwelling\r\nplaces. These \"huts\" today make up a small, very irregular town,\r\nwhich, however, possesses even a bazaar. By far the most noteworthy\r\nremains are the ruins of a bridge which used to cross the Tigris.\r\nThere was one gigantic arch with a span of between eighty and one\r\nhundred feet. I do not know whether the credit for such a daring\r\nstructure should be given to the Armenian kings or the Greek\r\nemperors, or perhaps even to the califs.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to travel more comfortably than we did. Stretched out\r\non downy pillows, and provided with victuals wine, tea, and a charcoal\r\nbasin, we moved down the stream with the rapidity of an express coach\r\nand without the least exertion. But the element which propelled us\r\npersecuted us in another form. Rain poured from the sky incessantly\r\nafter our departure from Diarbekir. Our umbrellas no longer protected\r\nus, and our cloaks, garments and carpets were soaked. On Easter day,\r\njust as we were leaving Dshesireh, the sun broke through the clouds,\r\nwarming our stiffened limbs. About two miles below the city the ruins\r\nof another bridge across the Tigris are still in existence, and one of\r\nits piers creates a fierce whirlpool whenever the water is high. The\r\nexertions of the men at the oars were of no avail, and irresistibly\r\nour small ark was attracted by this charybdis. With the speed of an\r\narrow we were sucked down below the surface, and a big comber broke\r\nover our heads. The water was icy cold, and when in the next moment\r\nour raft, which had not capsized, continued its way downstream as\r\ninnocently as if nothing had happened we could not help laughing at\r\none another, for we were a sad looking sight, everyone of us. The\r\ncharcoal basins had gone overboard, a boot swam alongside, while each\r\none of us hastened to fish out some little object. We made a landing\r\non a small island, and since our bags were as thoroughly soaked as we\r\nwere ourselves, we had to disrobe and spread our entire toilet in the\r\nsun to dry as well as possible. At some distance a flock of pelicans\r\nwere taking their rest on a sandbank and sunning their white plumage\r\nas if in derision of our plight. Suddenly we saw that our raft had got\r\nloose and was floating off. One of the _agas_ immediately jumped after\r\nit and fortunately reached it. If he had failed we should have been\r\nleft on a desert island in nothing but nature's own garb.\r\n\r\nWhen we were tolerably dry we continued our journey, but renewed\r\ndownpours spoiled the moderate results of our previous efforts. The\r\nnight was so dark that we had to tie up, for fear of being drawn into\r\nother whirlpools. In spite of the biting cold, and although we were\r\nwet to the skin, we did not dare to light a fire which might have\r\nattracted the Arabs. We silently pulled our raft into the shelter of a\r\nwillow tree and waited longingly for the sun to appear from behind the\r\nPersian frontier mountains and to give us warmth.\r\n\r\nNot far from Dshesireh the Tigris enters another plain and leaves\r\nbehind the high and magnificent Dshudid mountains on whose bright and\r\nsnow-clad peaks Noah and his mixed company are said to have\r\ndisembarked. From here on the scenery is very monotonous; you rarely\r\nsee a village, and most of those you see are uninhabited and in ruins.\r\nIt is apparent that you have entered the country of the Arabs. There\r\nare no trees, and where a small bush has survived it is a _siareth_ or\r\nsanctuary, and is covered with countless small rags. The sick people\r\nhere, you must know, believe they will recover when they sacrifice to\r\nthe saint a small part of their garments.\r\n\r\nOn the top of an isolated mountain of considerable height we could see\r\nat a great distance the ruins of an old city. When we approached it we\r\nactually passed along three sides of this mountain, on the north, east\r\nand south. The city was, I suppose, the ancient Bezabde of which the\r\nrecords say that it was situated in the desert and surrounded on three\r\nsides by the Tigris. Sapor laid siege to it after he had taken Amida\r\nand, when he had captured its three legions, gave it a Persian\r\ngarrison.\r\n\r\nGliding past the ruins of the so-called old Mossul we discovered\r\ntoward evening the minarets of Mossul. This is the most easterly point\r\nwhich I have visited, and my Turkish companions had to face west when\r\nthey offered their evening prayer, while in Constantinople the moslems\r\nare looking for the _Kibla_ in the southeast.\r\n\r\nMossul is the important half-way station for the caravans from Bagdad\r\nto Aleppo. Being situated in an oasis of the desert the city must at\r\nall times be on the lookout against the Arabs. The walls which\r\ncompletely surround the city are weak but high, and offer sufficient\r\nprotection against the irregular bands of mounted Bedouins. The\r\nBab-el-amadi gate, mentioned in the time of the crusaders, is still\r\nstanding, although it has been walled up. Most of the dwellings are\r\nbuilt of sun-dried bricks and a kind of mortar which hardens within a\r\nfew seconds. Following an Oriental custom great weight is attached to\r\nbeautiful and large entrance doors (_Bab_). You can see arched portals\r\nof marble (which is quarried immediately outside the city gates) in\r\nfront of houses and mudhuts the roofs of which scarcely reach to the\r\npoints of the arches. The roofs are flat, made of stamped earth\r\n(_Dam_), and are surrounded by low walls and parapets. In most of the\r\nlarger houses you can see traces of their having been hit by bullets,\r\nand the fortress-like aspect of these dwellings reminds you of the\r\npalaces of Florence, except that here everything is smaller, humbler\r\nand less perfect.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Mossul are a remarkable mixture of the original\r\nChaldean populace and the Arabs, Kurds, Persians and Turks who\r\nsuccessively have ruled over them. The common speech is Arabic.\r\n\r\nIndshe-Bairaktar, the governor, received us with great courtesy and\r\nhad us quartered with the Armenian Patriarch. The Nestorian and\r\nJacobite Christians of Mossul have the most beautiful churches I have\r\nseen in Turkey, but they are living in discord and hatred. One of\r\nthese churches happened to belong, I do not know why, to two\r\ncongregations, and since everything which the one did in these sacred\r\nhalls was an abomination in the eyes of the other, the beautiful vault\r\nhad been divided by a brick wall directly in the centre.\r\n\r\nOur Jacobite Patriarch was greatly troubled about having to house\r\nheretics, but he much preferred us to Nestorians or Greeks. Since no\r\nChristians, moreover, had ever been received with so much honor by\r\nthe Pasha, and the most important Mussulmans came to pay us their\r\nrespects, he treated us well, and even sold me a Bible in Arabic and\r\nSyrian (Chaldean).\r\n\r\nIn the northwesterly corner of the city the plateau falls off abruptly\r\ntoward the river. Here the water of the Tigris is raised by a\r\ncontrivance, which makes use of a high kind of derrick, leathern hose,\r\nand a rope which is pulled by a horse. The long nozzle of the hose\r\nempties into huge brick basins whence the water is distributed over\r\nfields and gardens. But only the empty areas within the walls and the\r\nfields adjacent to the city are cultivated. If only a fraction of all\r\nthe water rushing past Mossul could be used for irrigation purposes\r\nthis whole country would be one of the most fertile of the world. This\r\nidea undoubtedly induced the people ages ago to build the powerful\r\nstone dikes which hem in the course of the river a few hours above the\r\ncity. Surely, it would not be difficult to irrigate all the fields\r\nfrom there, but the Arabs hovering about the city make the harvesting\r\nof the crops too uncertain.\r\n\r\nThere is a bazaar especially for the Arabs immediately outside the\r\nwalls of Mossul, built there for the purpose of keeping these\r\nsuspicious characters from entering the city proper. Over the\r\nconfusion of many small mud-huts some slender palm trees rise to\r\nmajestic heights, the last ones of the desert. These palms are like\r\nreeds grown to the proportions of trees. They are typical of the\r\nsouth, and give confidence to the Arabs who seem to feel that they are\r\nway up north and yet still in the land of the myrrh and the incense.\r\nHere the children of the desert congregate and, pushing their\r\nbamboo-spears into the sand--point down, squat on the ground to admire\r\nthe glory of a city--even though it be a city which affects the\r\nEuropean with the very opposite of glory, but which for hundreds of\r\nmiles has no equal.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no people have preserved their character, customs, morals, and\r\nspeech as unchanged through centuries as the Arabs, and have done so\r\nin spite of the most manifold changes in the world at large. They were\r\nnomads, shepherds and hunters roving over little-known deserts, while\r\nEgypt and Assyria, Greece and Persia, Rome and Byzantium rose and\r\nfell. And then, inspired by one idea, these same nomads suddenly rose\r\nin their turn and for a long time became the masters of the most\r\nbeautiful valley of the old world, and were the bearers of the then\r\ncivilization and science. One hundred years after the death of the\r\nProphet, his first followers, the Sarazenes, ruled from the Himalayas\r\nto the Pyrenees, and from the Indies to the Atlantic Ocean. But\r\nChristianity and its higher spiritual and material perfection, yes\r\neven its intolerance, which its high morality should have made\r\nimpossible, drove the Arabs back again from Europe. The rude force of\r\nthe Turks undermined their rule in the Orient, and for the second time\r\nthe children of Ishmael saw themselves driven out into the desert.\r\n\r\nThose Arabs who had reached a higher state of culture, and had settled\r\ndown to the pursuit of agriculture, commerce, or industry, had to sink\r\nthe lower before the oppression of a rule of iron. The artificial\r\ndealings of a government trying to imitate European methods, and the\r\nassistance of the Franks, the introduction of the census and of taxes,\r\nof duties and monopolies, standing armies and conscriptions, the\r\nbarter of offices and the leasing of custom houses, slavery and the\r\nvices of the east, together with the energy, indomitable will and\r\nmarvelous luck of Mehmet Ali, all combined in one grand achievement--I\r\nmean the monumental tyranny, never yet equalled, under which the\r\nfellahs today are groaning in Egypt and the Arabs in Syria, and under\r\nwhich a whole country has been transformed into a private domain, and\r\na whole people into personal slaves.\r\n\r\nBy far the greater part of the Arabic nation, however, had remained\r\ntrue to its old customs, and no despotism could get hold of them. The\r\nextent of the Asiatic and African deserts, their fiery sky and parched\r\nsoil, and the poverty of the inhabitants have ever been the\r\nprotection of the Arabs. The rule of the Persians, the Romans, and the\r\nGreeks was never more than partial, and often existed only in name.\r\nThe Bedouin today, like his fathers of old, is still living the life\r\nof want, care, and independence, roving through the same steppes as\r\nthey, and watering his herds from the same wells as they did in the\r\ntime of Moses or of Mahomet.\r\n\r\nThe oldest descriptions of the Arabs fit the Bedouins of our day.\r\nUnquenchable feuds are still dividing the several tribes, the\r\npossession of a pasturing place or of a well still determines the\r\nwelfare of many families, and blood-feuds and hospitality still are\r\nthe vices and virtues of this people of nature. Wherever along their\r\nfrontiers the Arabs come in contact with foreign nations war is the\r\nresult. The children of Abraham divided among themselves the rich and\r\nfertile countries, while Ishmael and his tribe were cast out into the\r\ndesert. Shut off from all the other people the Arabs consider\r\nforeigners and foes to be identical and, unable to procure for\r\nthemselves the products of industry, they believe they are justified\r\nin appropriating them wherever they find them.\r\n\r\nThe pashas of the frontier provinces repay these constant depredations\r\nwith repressive measures on a big scale and are not concerned about\r\nthe individuals who are made to suffer. When they saunter forth with a\r\nfew regiments of regular cavalry and a field gun they are sure to\r\nscatter even the biggest _ashiret_ or encampment. The Arab does not\r\nlike to stand his ground against gun-fire and never resists an\r\nartillery-attack which he cannot of course return. He does not fear so\r\nmuch for his own life, as for that of his horse, for a full blooded\r\nmare often makes up the whole wealth of three or four families. Woe to\r\nthe horse which with us is owned by three or four masters. With the\r\nArabs it has as many friends to take care of it.\r\n\r\nWhen the Turks succeed in surprising an _ashiret_ they take away the\r\nherds of sheep and goats, a few camels, and possibly some hostages\r\nwhom they keep in miserable bondage. In a small hut or stable of the\r\nserail of Orfa I found nine old men. A heavy chain attached to rings\r\naround their necks fastened the one to the other, and twice daily they\r\nwere driven to the watering trough just like cattle. The Turks had\r\ndemanded of their tribe the exorbitant ransom of 150,000 piasters, of\r\nwhich one third had actually been offered. When I saw the old men,\r\nthere was little chance of their ever being ransomed at all. The\r\npasha, however, promised me that he would set them free. I do not know\r\nwhether he kept his word.\r\n\r\nSuch examples do not deter the Arabs, and, as far as their horses are\r\nable to go, no settlement can endure. The entire southern slope of the\r\nTaurus, the ancient Oszoene, is dotted with indications of their\r\ndevastation. Here wonderful brooks are flowing from the mountains, and\r\na superabundant supply of water, a hot and ever bright sky, and a most\r\nfertile soil have combined in creating a paradise, if only men would\r\nnot always destroy it. Snow is unknown here, and olive-trees, vines,\r\nmulberry trees, palms and pomegranate trees spring up wherever you\r\nguide a stream of water, however small, while the yield of grain,\r\nrice, and cotton is phenomenal. But of Karrat, now Harran, the seat of\r\nAbraham, only a mound of earth and a few crumbled walls remain. Dara,\r\nthe magnificent creation of Justinian, lies in ruins, and on the site\r\nof Nisibin, which had been completely destroyed, Hafiss-Pasha has\r\nbuilt only recently some new cavalry barracks, under whose protection\r\nthe city and the surrounding villages have taken a new lease of life.\r\nOrfa and Mossul finally, the only large cities, appear like outposts\r\nof Mesopotamia.\r\n\r\nIn their robber-expeditions the Arabs have the hope of booty before\r\nthem and behind them the assurance of a safe retreat. They alone know\r\nthe pasturing grounds and the hidden wells of the desert, they alone\r\ncan live in these regions, and do so by the help of the camel. This\r\nanimal, which can carry a load of from five hundred to six hundred\r\npounds, takes all their property, their wives, children, and old men,\r\ntheir tents, provisions and water from one place to another. It can\r\nmake six, eight, even ten days' marches without drinking, and a fifth\r\nstomach keeps a final draft in reserve in case of greatest need. Its\r\nhair is made into garments and cloth for the tents; its urine yields\r\nsalt, its droppings are used for fuel and, in caves, are transformed\r\ninto saltpeter from which the Arabs make their own gunpowder. The milk\r\nof the camel serves as food not only for the children, but also for\r\nthe colts, which grow thin but strong like our horses when they are in\r\ntraining. Camel meat is tasty and wholesome, and even the skin and the\r\nbones of a camel are good for something. The most wretched feed, dry\r\ngrass, thistles and brambles, satisfies this patient, strong, helpless\r\nand most useful of all animals. Next to the camels, which even the\r\npoorest Arab owns in almost incredible numbers, the horses represent\r\nthe chief wealth of these children of the desert. It is well known\r\nthat these animals grow up in the tents together with the children of\r\nthe family with whom they share food, deprivations and hardships, and\r\nthat the birth of a colt of fine lineage marks a day of joy in the\r\nwhole _ashiret_.\r\n\r\nIn Europe the Arabian horses are classified according to an erroneous\r\nand incomplete system. I am thinking especially of their division into\r\n_Kohilans_ and _Nedshdis_. This latter name designates the numerous\r\ntribe of Arabs inhabiting the high plateau of the interior of Arabia,\r\nand breeding, it is true, excellent horses. But just as little as\r\nevery Arabian horse is full blooded, just as little every _Nedshdi_ is\r\na _Kohilan_. This is the whole matter: _Kohilan_ was the favorite\r\nhorse of Hasaret-Suleiman-Peigamber (His Highness Solomon the\r\nProphet). It is, moreover, true and no legend that the better horses\r\nreceive at birth their family-tree, in which their parents, and often\r\ntheir grandfathers, are mentioned, and which they carry through life,\r\ngenerally in a triangular capsule, by a string around their neck. In\r\nthe course of centuries several of Kohilan's descendants have so\r\ngreatly distinguished themselves that they have become sires of note\r\nin their own name. Among the most notable descendants of Kohilan I\r\nheard mentioned the colts of Meneghi, and next of Terafi, Djelevi,\r\nSakali, and many more. Mahomet himself rode a Kohilan of the family of\r\nMeneghi on his flight from Medina. You understand, therefore, that not\r\nevery Nedshdi has to be full-blooded, and that a Kohilan may be as\r\nwell an Aenesi or Shamarly as a Nedshdi.\r\n\r\nThe Arabs of the race of Shamarr who camp in the country between\r\nthe two rivers, and who can muster ten thousand mounted men, had\r\nrecently been guilty of many robberies, and had refused to\r\nrecognize the new sheikh whom the Porte had appointed over them.\r\nHafiss-Pasha, therefore, decided to give them a most thorough\r\nchastisement. The pashas of Orfa and of Mardin were to march\r\nagainst them, and he wanted to have the pasha of Mossul, who is\r\nnot under his jurisdiction, do the same. If this had been done,\r\nthe Arabs would have been forced back against the Euphrates,\r\nbeyond which the Aenesi Arabs live who are hostile to them. But\r\nIndshe-Bairaktar did not fancy an expedition which was expensive\r\nand promised little booty. When finally definite orders came from\r\nthe Bagdad-Valesi, the other pashas had already scared away the\r\nenemy, who had disappeared into unknown regions.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief and interesting sojourn, therefore, we decided to return\r\nthrough the desert with a caravan which was on the point of starting.\r\nSince the Arabs had been greatly incensed by the recent attacks, the\r\nexpedition was increased by forty horsemen. We joined it toward\r\nevening in its encampment, about two hours from Mossul, near the\r\nTigris where everybody wished to have one more last good fill of\r\nwater. The _Kyerwan-Bashi,_ or leader of the caravan, whom the pasha\r\nhad notified of our arrival, at once made his appearance and had his\r\ntent made ready for us. He also presented us with a goat for supper.\r\n\r\nFor five days we traversed the _Tsull,_ or desert of northern\r\nMesopotamia, without seeing any human habitations. You must not think\r\nof this desert as a sea of sand, but as an interminable green plain\r\nwith only occasional, very slight undulations. The Arabs call it\r\n_Bahr,_ the sea, and the caravans proceed in an absolutely straight\r\nline, taking their direction from artificial mounts which rise above\r\nthe plain like prehistoric graves. They indicate that once upon a time\r\na village existed here, and that, therefore, a well or a spring must\r\nbe nearby. But the mounts often are six, ten or even twelve hours\r\ndistant the one from the other. The villages have disappeared, the\r\nwells have gone dry, and the rivulets are bitterly salt. A few weeks\r\nlater this green plain which now is nourished by copious daily dews\r\nwill be a wild waste parched by the sun. The luxuriant growth of grass\r\nwhich today reaches to our stirrups will be withered and every\r\nwater-course run dry. Then it will be necessary to follow the Tigris\r\nin a wide détour, and none but the ships of the desert, the camels,\r\nwill be able to traverse this plain, and they only by night.\r\n\r\nOur caravan consists of six hundred camels and four hundred mules. The\r\nbig bags carried by the former contain almost exclusively palm-nuts\r\nfor the dye houses of Aleppo, and cotton. The more valuable part of\r\nthe freight, silk from Bagdad and shawls from Persia, pearls from\r\nBassora, and good silver money which in Constantinople will be\r\nrecoined into bad piasters, is small in proportion to the bulk\r\ncarried.\r\n\r\nThe camels go in strings of from ten to twenty, one behind the other.\r\nThe owner rides ahead on a small donkey, and although his stirrups are\r\nshort his feet almost touch the ground. He is continually shoving his\r\npointed slippers into the flanks of his poor beast and placidly\r\nsmoking his pipe. His servants are on foot. Unless the donkey leads,\r\nthe camels refuse to stir. With long thoughtful strides they move\r\nalong, reaching the while with their thin restless necks for thistles\r\nor thorns by the roadside. The mules are walking at a brisk pace.\r\nThey are decorated with little bells and beautiful halters gaily set\r\nwith shells.\r\n\r\nWhen the caravan has come to the place where the night is to be spent,\r\nthe _Kjerwan-Bashi_ canters ahead and designates the exact spot for\r\nthe camp. The beasts of burden are unloaded as they arrive, and the\r\nhuge bags are placed together as a kind of fortification in the shape\r\nof a quadrangle, within which each one prepares himself a place of\r\nrest. Our tent, which was the only one in the caravan, stood outside\r\nand was given a special guard of _Bashi-Bazouks_. The camels and mules\r\nwere turned loose in the high grass where they were expected to look\r\nalso for all the water they needed.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it grows dark the camels, which have roved often at half an\r\nhour's distance, are collected. The leaders call to them, and since\r\neach one knows his master's poah! poah! they obediently come home.\r\nThey are arranged in rows within the quadrangle. The smallest boy can\r\ncontrol these big, strong, yet harmless and helpless animals. He\r\ncalls: Krr! krr! and the huge beasts patiently sink to their knees.\r\nThen they fold their hind legs, and after a series of strange,\r\nundulating movements all are lying in regular rows, moving their long\r\nnecks in every direction and looking about. I have always noticed the\r\nresemblance of a camel's neck with that of an ostrich, and the Turks\r\ncall these birds _deve-kush_, the camel-birds. A thin cord is then\r\ntied around one bent knee of each camel. If it should rise it would\r\nhave to stand on three legs, and would be unable to move.\r\n\r\nOn this evening we were visited by several friendly Arabs, short and\r\nthin, but strong and sinewy people. Their complexion was\r\nyellowish-brown, their eyes were small and vivacious. An assumed\r\ndignity barely disguised their native vivacity, and their guttural\r\nspeech reminded us very strongly of the Jews. Their dress consisted of\r\na rough cotton shirt, a white woolen cloak and a red and yellow\r\nkerchief, half-silk, which each man had fastened about his head\r\nwith a string, just as you see it on the Egyptian statues.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOLTKE AT SEDAN ANTON VON WERNER]\r\n\r\nHunting-in the _Tshull_ is highly successful. There are countless\r\ngazelles, pheasants and partridges hiding in the tall grass. On the\r\nthird day we were just on the point of following some bustards, which\r\nclumsily rise on their wings and after some time descend again to the\r\nground, when a general alarm arose in the caravan. \"The Arabs are\r\ncoming!\" was shouted everywhere. A throng had been noticed in the\r\ndistance approaching very rapidly. The head of our column stopped, but\r\nsince our whole caravan was stretched out to the length of\r\napproximately four miles, there was little hope of protecting it with\r\na guard of some sixty armed men. The horsemen galloped ahead to an\r\nartificial mount, where the Arabs were pointed out to me. There were\r\nindeed numerous black spots moving rapidly through the plain, but\r\nsince I had a small telescope with me I could quickly convince my\r\ncompanions that what we saw before us was nothing but a huge herd of\r\nwild boars bearing down upon us. Soon the beasts could be recognized\r\nwith the naked eye.\r\n\r\nTonight the _Kjerwan-Bashi_ told me a characteristic story of an Arab\r\nwhich I had heard before in Orfa.\r\n\r\nA Turkish general of cavalry, Dano-Pasha at Mardin, had been\r\nnegotiating for some time with an Arab tribe concerning the purchase\r\nof a full-blooded mare of the Meneghi breed. Finally a price of sixty\r\nbags or almost fifteen hundred dollars was agreed upon. At the\r\nappointed hour the sheikh of the tribe arrives with his mare in the\r\ncourtyard of the pasha. The latter is still trying to bargain, when\r\nthe sheikh proudly replies that he will not take one _para_ less. The\r\nTurk sulkily throws him the money saying that thirty thousand piasters\r\nare an unheard of price for a horse. The Arab looks at him in silence,\r\nand ties the money very complacently in his cloak. Then he descends to\r\nthe courtyard to take leave of his mare. He mutters some Arabic words\r\nin her ear, strokes her eyes and forehead, examines her hoofs, and\r\nwalks all around her, carefully studying the attentive horse. Suddenly\r\nhe jumps on her bare back, and, in the same instant, off she shoots\r\nlike a dart out of the courtyard.\r\n\r\nIn this country the horses generally stand ready with their _palans_\r\nor felt saddles on, day and night. Every distinguished man has at\r\nleast one or two horses in his stable ready to be mounted as soon as\r\nthey have been bridled. The Arabs, however, ride without bridles. The\r\nhalter serves to check the horse, and a gentle tap with the open hand\r\non the neck makes it go to the right or the left. Not more than a few\r\nseconds, therefore, elapsed before the _agas_ of the pasha were\r\nmounted and in hot pursuit of the fugitive.\r\n\r\nThe unshod hoofs of the Arabian mare had never yet trodden cobble\r\nstones, and very carefully she picked her way while she hastened down\r\nthe steep, uneven road leading from the castle. The Turks, on the\r\nother hand, galloped over the steep descent with its loose pebbles\r\njust as we often gallop up a sandy slope. Thin, circular shoes, forged\r\ncold, kept all harm from the feet of their horses, which were\r\naccustomed to such trips and made no false steps.\r\n\r\nWhere the village ends the _agas_ have almost caught up with the\r\nsheikh, but now they are in the plain, the Arabian mare is in her\r\nelement, off she darts, straight ahead, for here there are neither\r\nditches nor fences, neither rivers nor mountains to delay her course.\r\nLike a clever jockey who leads a race, the Arab wishes to ride as\r\nslowly and not as quickly as possible. Constantly looking back at his\r\npursuers, he keeps out of gunshot. When they approach he pushes on;\r\nwhen they fall behind, he slows the pace of his horse; when they stop,\r\nhe walks his mare. Thus the chase continues till the fiery orb of the\r\nsun verges toward the horizon. Then for the first time the Arab\r\ndemands of his horse every ounce of her strength. Crouching over her\r\nneck he drives his heels into her flanks, and with a loud \"Jellah!\" is\r\ngone. The sod resounds under powerful hoof-beats, and soon only a\r\ncloud of dust indicates to his pursuers the course he has taken.\r\n\r\nHere where the sun descends to the horizon almost in a vertical line\r\nthe twilight is exceedingly brief and soon dark night had swallowed up\r\nevery trace of the fugitive. The Turks, without provision for\r\nthemselves or water for their horses, realized that they were some\r\ntwelve or fifteen hours away from home and in an unknown locality.\r\nWhat could they do but return and bring to their irate master the\r\nunwelcome news that both the horse and the rider with the money were\r\ngone? Not until the third evening did they reach Mardin, half dead of\r\nexhaustion and with horses hardly able to put one foot ahead of the\r\nother. Their only consolation was that here there was another instance\r\nof Arabian perfidy for them to revile. The traitor's horse, to be\r\nsure, they were obliged to praise, and they had to confess that such\r\nan animal could hardly be paid for too dearly.\r\n\r\nNext day, just when the _Imam_ is calling to morning prayer, the pasha\r\nhears hoofbeats under his window, and into the courtyard the sheikh is\r\nriding entirely unabashed. \"Sidi,\" he calls up, \"Sir, do you want your\r\nmoney or my horse?\"\r\n\r\nSomewhat less quickly than the Arab had ridden we reached on the fifth\r\nday the foot of the mountain and near a clear rivulet the large\r\nvillage of Tillaja (Tshilaga), doubtless the ancient Tilsaphata, where\r\nthe starving army of Jovian on its retreat from Persia to Nisibin\r\nfound its first provisions. There I learned that on that very morning\r\nMehmet-Pasha had started with an army on an expedition against the\r\nKurds in the north. I at once decided to join him and, leaving the\r\ncaravan, arrived at his camp that same evening. There I was told that\r\nHafiss-Pasha had sent a guard of fifty horsemen to meet us, whom we\r\nhad missed, because they had looked for us in the direction of\r\nSindjar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA BULLFIGHT IN SPAIN\r\n\r\nTRANSLATED BY EDMUND VON MACH, PH.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n[From a letter written by Moltke to his brother Fritz and dated\r\nOctober 28, 1846.]\r\n\r\nMy most interesting experience was a bullfight. At three in the\r\nafternoon my Frenchman and I betook ourselves to the circular arena\r\nwhere twelve thousand people were assembled to watch the _Corrida de\r\nToros_. There are about twenty stone steps on which the people take\r\ntheir places, just as in the ancient amphitheatres, and on top there\r\nare two tiers of boxes, of which the one in the centre is reserved for\r\nthe queen. The arena proper where the fight is to take place is\r\nperfectly empty, and is separated from the spectators by a barrier of\r\nbeams and planks seven feet in height. A small platform makes it\r\npossible for those who fight on foot to vault safely from the arena\r\nwhen they can avoid the bull in no other way.\r\n\r\nAfter some delay the gates opened and the _alguazil_, some kind of a\r\nhigher official clad in old-fashioned garb, rode in and announced that\r\nthe game was about to begin. He was everywhere greeted with hoots,\r\nridicule and disrespectful whistling; I do not know why. But he seemed\r\nto know what to expect, for he apparently did not mind his reception\r\nin the least. The Romans in the circus made sport of their consuls and\r\nemperors, and the Spaniards at a bullfight are permitted an equal\r\nlatitude of behavior.\r\n\r\nThen the _chulos_ entered--on foot, with gay hangings draped over\r\ntheir right arms. They were followed by six _picadores_ on horseback,\r\ndressed in leather jerkins and breeches, protected on the right side\r\nwith bands of iron. They wore Spanish hats and carried each a heavy\r\nspear on which there was an iron point only half an inch long. Their\r\nsaddles were of the high cowboy type, and they sat their horses well.\r\nUnder the accompaniment of deafening applause the _matador_\r\n(literally, the murderer) took his place at their head. His name was\r\nCuchiera, and he was a famous and celebrated hero of the arena. Thus\r\nthis phalanx advanced toward the royal box, where Queen Christine,\r\nwife of Muñoz, Duke of Rianzares, was seated, and dropped to their\r\nknees to offer her the royal salute; whereupon twelve thousand people\r\nhissed.\r\n\r\nAt last the chief actor entered, a powerful black bull with sharp\r\nhorns and fiercely glistening eyes. He had been in a room with holes\r\nin the ceiling through which he had been poked with pointed sticks. He\r\nwas, therefore, tolerably ill-humored before he entered the arena. As\r\nsoon as the doors of his prison were opened he shot forward to the\r\ncentre of the field, looked fiercely about him, greatly astonished,\r\npawed the sand with his feet, and then hurled himself upon the nearest\r\n_picador_. This man held his ground, and permitted the maddened bull\r\nto rush against his pointed spear. The horse had his right eye\r\nbandaged lest he see the bull and bolt. The attack, however, was so\r\nfierce, and the rider so firmly seated in his saddle, that both he and\r\nhis horse were lifted up and thrown over backwards. At the same moment\r\nthe sharp horns of the bull were fastened in the horse's belly. A\r\nstream of blood, thick as your finger, spurted out directly from the\r\nhorse's heart. The _picador_ was lying under his charger, and was\r\nprevented by his costume from freeing himself. His certain end was at\r\nhand if the _chulos_ had not come to his assistance with their gay\r\ndraperies. The bull immediately let go his prey and hurled himself\r\nupon the men on foot, or rather upon their gaudy cloaks. He chased one\r\nthe entire length of the arena and, when his foe had escaped him by\r\njumping the barrier, he made the stout fence tremble under his\r\nhammering horns. At the disappearance of his enemy the bull stood\r\nstock still, as if dumfounded, until a second _picador_ met his\r\nglance. This horseman had the same experience as his predecessor, but\r\nbefore the _chulos_ could bring help the bull buried his horns a\r\nsecond time in the belly of the convulsed horse and carried it high up\r\nin the air through half the length of the arena. The third horse was\r\nripped open in a trice. The wretched animal actually caught his feet\r\nin his own entrails and dragged them from his body bit by bit. In this\r\ncondition he was beaten and given the spurs and was forced to await a\r\nsecond attack by the infuriated bull.\r\n\r\nSince the bull each time had received a terrific thrust on his left\r\nshoulder from the spear, he finally refused to charge another one of\r\nthe _picadores_. Their places, therefore, had to be taken by the\r\n_banderilleros_. These gay-looking people are men on foot with arrows\r\ntwo feet long, each with a hooked point. On the other end these arrows\r\nare decorated with little flags, brass foil, tinsel, and even bird\r\ncages whence gaily decked birds are permitted to escape. With these\r\narrows the _banderilleros_ walk right up to the bull, and, when he is\r\nready to charge, jump to one side and thrust their weapons deep into\r\nhis neck, halfway between his ears and his horns. Then the beast grows\r\naltogether mad and furious, and often chases a whole band of _chulos_\r\nin wild flight over the barrier, which calls for noisy shouts of\r\nridicule from the crowd. Once the bull straddled the fence, and there\r\nhave been times when he has succeeded in scaling it. One of the\r\n_chulos_ was so bold as to put his gaudy cloak over his shoulders, so\r\nthat the bull charged straight at him. But as the beast lowered his\r\nhead and threw himself forward with closed eyes, the man jumped over\r\nhim and stood by his side.\r\n\r\nWhen finally the rage of the bull is at its height, but his strength\r\nis waning, the _matador_ faces him, all alone. At once a hush falls\r\nover the spectators, who sit in rapt attention, for the _matador's_\r\nwork is by far the most dangerous.\r\n\r\nHe is a fine-looking man, in shoes and white stockings. His silk coat\r\nand breeches are sky blue; his hair is tied in a net, in his left hand\r\nhe carries a small scarlet cloak, and in his right a diamond-shaped\r\nblade of sharp Toledo steel, four feet in length. It is necessary to\r\ndrive this into the neck of the bull at a very definite point, for if\r\nit hits him elsewhere he can shake it off and break it into splinters.\r\nIn order to hit the right spot the man must let the bull pass him at a\r\ndistance of only two or at best three inches. Everything is based on\r\nthe assumption that the bull will attack the red cloth rather than the\r\nman, and will continue his course in an absolutely straight line.\r\nThere are exceptions, and then the _matador_ is lost.\r\n\r\nVery deliberately the _caballero_ walked up to his black antagonist\r\nand shook his red cloth at him. Twice he let him pass under his arm.\r\nAt the third attempt he thrust his blade up to the hilt into the neck\r\nof the beast. For another minute perhaps the bull rages, then he\r\nbegins to bleed from his mouth, he totters and then collapses.\r\nImmediately a kind of hangman's assistant sneaks up from behind and\r\nplunges a dagger into the neck of the bull, who expires on the spot.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture five mules decorated with ribbons and tinkling bells\r\ncame trotting into the arena; they were hitched up to the horses and\r\nthen to the bull, and at a fast clip carried the corpses away. Some\r\nsand was then sprinkled on the puddles of blood, and a new bull\r\nbrought out. In this way eight bulls were driven to death. Twenty\r\nhorses fell dead, while several more were led away mortally wounded. A\r\nsingle bull killed eight horses. No men were seriously hurt.\r\n\r\nThe horses, it is true, are of such a quality that, if they are not\r\nkilled today, they will be taken to the horse-butcher tomorrow. Good\r\nhorses would not only be too expensive, but they would also refuse to\r\nawait the attack of the bull without shying or offering resistance,\r\neven if their right eyes were bandaged. The more horses the bull has\r\nkilled and the more dangerous to the men he has become, the louder is\r\nthe applause. One bull persistently refused to attack the _picadores_.\r\nHe ran up and down the arena, trembling with fear, while the crowd\r\nshrieked curses and imprecations. At last they yelled: _Los perros_!\r\n(the dogs!) When the dogs arrived in the arena they could hardly be\r\nrestrained. Madly they rushed upon the bull, who at once gored one of\r\nthem and tossed him high in the air. The others, however, fastened on\r\nhim, one of them seizing his tongue so firmly that he was swung high\r\nup in the air and down again. You could have torn him to pieces before\r\nhe would have let go. Finally four dogs had the bull in a position\r\nwhere he could not free himself, and the matador struck him down.\r\n\r\nWhile this butchery was at its height, the young queen with the\r\nInfanta entered, accompanied by Don Francesco, her husband, and the\r\nDuke of Montpensier. Aumale had arrived earlier. The queen looked very\r\nhappy and is by no means so ugly as the papers say. She is blonde,\r\nrather stout, and not at all plain. The Infanta is small, extremely\r\ndark and thin. The queen was greeted by the _matador_ just as her\r\nmother had been, but by the spectators with much enthusiasm. When the\r\neighth bull was killed, it began to grow dark, but all the people\r\nyelled \"_un otro toro_,\" and the ninth bull was hunted down almost in\r\ndarkness--which is very dangerous for the _matador_.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the spectacle which the Spaniards love better than\r\nanything else, which is watched by the tenderest of women, and which\r\nbrought a smile to the face of the Infanta, a recent bride. So far as\r\nI am concerned, one bullfight was quite enough for me, and its\r\ndescription, I fancy, will be enough for you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF MOSCOW[38] (1856)\r\n\r\nTRANSLATED BY GRACE BIGELOW\r\n\r\n\r\nThursday, August 28th\r\n\r\nThe City of Moscow takes it for granted that the Emperor has not yet\r\narrived. A few assert that he has been since yesterday at the Castle\r\nPetrofskoy, an hour's ride from here, where he is holding court and\r\nreviewing a hundred thousand Guards; but that is his incognito;\r\nofficially, he is not yet here.\r\n\r\nThe Holy City is preparing for the reception that is to take place\r\ntomorrow. They are hammering and pounding in all the streets and on\r\nall the squares. Most of the houses here stand alone, in the centre of\r\na garden or court. Large tribunes for spectators have been erected in\r\nthese spaces. In several of these I counted three thousand numbered\r\nseats. Before the houses themselves, moreover, small platforms with\r\nchairs have been erected, protected by linen awnings, decorated with\r\ntapestries, carpets and flowers. There must be at least several\r\nhundred thousand seats, so that there can be no crowd. Only those who\r\ncannot pay the few kopecks,[39] the Tschornoi Narod, or \"the black\r\nbrood of the people,\" will form the movable mass, and the police will\r\nhave to restrain them.\r\n\r\nAll palaces and churches have laths nailed on their architectonic\r\nlines, upon which the lamps for the festive illuminations are to be\r\nfastened. The Giant Ivan, which will speak from the mouths of\r\ntwenty-five large bells, bears upon its golden dome a crown formed of\r\nlamps, surmounted by the great glittering cross, which the French\r\npulled down with immense toil and danger, and which the Russians\r\nvictoriously reinstated. As an atonement for the offense, they laid\r\none thousand guns of the godless enemy at the feet of Ivan, where\r\nCount Morny can see them to this day.\r\n\r\nHalf of the population of the city are in the streets, looking about,\r\nand they are allowed to go everywhere, even in the Kremlin.\r\n\r\nEvery day six-and eight-horse teams, mostly dark gray and black, which\r\nare going to convey the state coaches of the Empress and the\r\nGrand-Duchesses, are going to and fro from the Kremlin to Petrofskoy.\r\nStrangely enough, the outriders sit on the right front horses. An\r\nequerry of the Guards walks by each horse and leads it by the bridle.\r\nYesterday their Excellencies carried a fearfully heavy canopy,\r\nsupported by thick gold posts, through the salons and over the stairs\r\nof the palace. The aides-de-camp walk by the side of it, and balance\r\nit by golden cords.\r\n\r\nThe state coaches, most wonderful products of former centuries, have\r\nbeen drawn out of their semi-obscurity in the Arsenal, where they have\r\nrested twenty-eight years. The oldest are entirely without springs,\r\nare suspended by leather straps six feet long over a tongue twenty\r\nfeet long and correspondingly thick, which is so bent that the coach\r\nalmost reaches the ground. Those of the Empresses are ornamented with\r\ndiamonds and jewels. It will hardly be possible to use the oldest.\r\nThere is, further, a kind of house on wheels, made of gold, velvet,\r\nand crystal, which Peter the Great received as a present from England,\r\nand compared to which a thirty-six pounder is but a child's toy. In\r\nshort, everything is life and activity here, in expectation of the\r\nvolleys of cannon which will announce tomorrow from the old gate\r\ntowers of the Kremlin the solemn entrance of the Czar.\r\n\r\nYesterday the Emperor wished to ride through the camp of the Guards,\r\nwhom he has not seen since he ascended the throne, because, in\r\nconsequence of the war, they had been removed to Lithuania and Poland,\r\nand are now encamped at an hour's distance on a vast plain. A solemn\r\nmass, at which the Empress was also present, preceded this. We drove\r\nout in complete gala dress through thick clouds of dust. The Emperor\r\nrode with his suite. He looked very well on horseback. At this moment\r\nit began to rain, and poured uninterruptedly. Fortunately we found\r\nshelter under the open tent in which the altar was, and in which the\r\nmass was said, or, rather, sung. All further inspection was\r\ncountermanded, and we returned home.\r\n\r\nIn the evening I drove to Petrofskoy. It lies in the midst of a wood,\r\nand has a very odd appearance. The castle proper is a three-storied\r\nquadrangle with a green cupola. The entrances are supported by the\r\nmost singular bottle-shaped bulging columns, and the whole is\r\nsurrounded by a turreted wall, with battlements and loopholes. This\r\nred-and white-painted fortress, the light of which radiates from the\r\nhigh windows through the dark forest, recalls a fable of the _Arabian\r\nNights_. All monasteries and castles here are fortified. They were the\r\nonly points capable of holding out when the Golden Tribe rushed upon\r\nthem with twenty or thirty thousand horses, and devastated all that\r\nflat country. Long after their yoke was broken, the Khans of Tartary\r\nin the Crimea were formidable enemies. The watchmen from the highest\r\nbattlements of the Kremlin were continually observing the wide expanse\r\ntoward the south; and when the dust-clouds rose thence, and the great\r\nbell (kolokol) of Ivan Welicki rang the alarm, every one fled behind\r\nthe walls of the Czar's palace or to the monasteries, upon whose walls\r\nthe infuriated horsemen struck and dashed in vain. The Christianity,\r\nscience, and culture of the Russian nation sought shelter in the\r\ncloisters, and from them started afterward Russia's deliverance from\r\nthe domination of the Mongolians and Poles.\r\n\r\nToday there was again mass in the open air, and five battalions\r\nreceived new flags, which in addition were blessed by the priests;\r\nthen the Metropolitan Archbishop walked the length of the front and\r\nsprinkled the troops thoroughly with holy water; some of the men were\r\npractically soaked to the skin. The Emperor and both Empresses not\r\nonly kissed the cross, but the archbishop's hand. Then the Emperor\r\npassed the front of every battalion, and, with a true military\r\nattitude, spoke a few words to the men, which were received with\r\nendless applause. He was an excellent rider, and rode a well-trained\r\nhorse. Then he inspected the front of the whole camp--one and a half\r\nGerman miles. There were seventy-four battalions, with eight hundred\r\nmen apiece--about sixty thousand men in all. They stood unarmed and in\r\ncaps, all of them old, bearded, and dark-faced.\r\n\r\nI care nothing for the deafening hurrahs that lasted two hours; but\r\nthese old, mustached men show how glad they are to see their Czar.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor spoke to some of them. They answered their Batuschka\r\n(little father) without embarrassment. In Russia the family is the\r\nmicrocosm of the State. All power rests with the father. All theories\r\nof representative government in Russia are pure nonsense. \"How can\r\nhuman statutes circumscribe the divine right of a father?\" asks the\r\nRussian. So that the unlimited power in the hands of the Emperor is\r\nnecessary and beneficial in a land where nothing is done that is not\r\nordered from above.\r\n\r\nWhoever should gaze, as I have done, on a warm, sunny day, upon the\r\ncity of Moscow for the first time from the height of the Kremlin would\r\ncertainly not think that he was in the same latitude in which the\r\nreindeer graze in Siberia, and the dogs drag the sleighs over the ice\r\nin Kamtchatka. Moscow reminds one of the South, but of something\r\nstrange never seen before. One seems to be transported to Ispahan,\r\nBagdad, or some other place--to the scene of the story of the\r\nSultaness Scheherezade.\r\n\r\nAlthough Moscow does not count more than three hundred thousand\r\ninhabitants, it covers two square miles with its houses, gardens,\r\nchurches, and monasteries. In this flat region one can hardly see\r\nbeyond the extreme suburbs, and houses and trees extend to the\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\nNo city in the world, with the exception of Rome, has so many\r\nchurches as the holy Stolitza of Russia. It is affirmed that Moscow\r\nboasts of forty times forty churches. Each one has at least five, and\r\nseveral even sixteen, cupolas that are brilliantly painted, and\r\ncovered with colored glazed bricks, or richly silvered and gilded,\r\nglittering in the blue atmosphere like the sun when it is half above\r\nthe horizon. Even the graceful towers, rising sometimes to\r\nconsiderable heights from the immense mass of houses and gardens, are\r\nsimilarly ornamented, and neither do the larger ones among the palaces\r\nlack the addition of a cupola.\r\n\r\nThe dwelling houses are almost always in gardens, and are distinctly\r\noutlined against the dark background of trees by their white walls and\r\nflat iron roofs painted light green or red. The oldest part alone,\r\nclose to the Kremlin--the Kitai-Gorod, or the Chinese quarter--forms a\r\ncity according to our notions, where the houses touch each other, and\r\nare carefully enclosed by a beautiful turreted wall, here, of course,\r\npainted white. All the rest seems to be a large collection of country\r\nhouses, between which the Moskwa winds its way.\r\n\r\nThe Kremlin contains (besides the palaces of the Czars and the\r\nPatriarchs) the Arsenal and the treasures of the church. Here are\r\nconcentrated the highest civil and religious powers. The cloisters,\r\nmostly at the extremities of the city, are fortresses in themselves.\r\n\r\nIt was in the Kitai-Gorod that the commercial guild established\r\nitself, needing for its wares, imported from China, Bucharia,\r\nByzantium, and Novgorod, the protection of walls. The rest, and by far\r\nthe larger part of Moscow, was built by the nobility for themselves;\r\nand long after the first Emperor had raised a new capital upon the\r\nenemy's ground it was looked upon with contempt by the grandees of the\r\nEmpire, still faithfully clinging to the customs of their fathers.\r\n\r\nThe venerable city of Moscow, with its ancient, sacred relics and\r\nhistorical reminiscences, still remains an object of veneration and\r\nlove to every Russian; and, often coming from a distance of hundreds\r\nof miles, when getting a glimpse of the golden cross on the Church of\r\nIvan Welicki, he falls on his knees in reverence and patriotic\r\nfervor. St. Petersburg is his pride, but Moscow is nearer to his\r\nheart. And, in truth, Moscow has no resemblance to St. Petersburg.\r\nThere is no Neva here, no sea, no steamers; nowhere a straight street,\r\na large square, or a wooded island. But Moscow has as little\r\nresemblance to any other city. The cupolas, the flat roofs and the\r\ntrees remind one of the East; but there the cupolas are more curved,\r\ncovered with gray lead, and surmounted by delicate minarets; the\r\nhouses show no windows toward the street; and the gardens are enclosed\r\nby high, dead, monotonous walls. Moscow has a character of its own;\r\nand if one wishes to compare it with anything, it must be called\r\nByzantine-Moresque. Russia received her Christianity and first\r\ncivilization from Byzantium. Until of late years she remained\r\ncompletely shut off from the East, and what culture she once adopted\r\nbecame rapidly nationalized. The heavy scourge of the Mongolian and\r\nTartar domination, which burdened this country for nearly three\r\ncenturies, prevented for a long time any further progress. All culture\r\nwas confined to the monasteries, and to these they afterward owed\r\ntheir deliverance. The Khans of Tartary never required their\r\nsubmission to Islam; they satisfied themselves with the tribute. In\r\norder to raise this, they had recourse to native authority. They\r\nsupported the power of the Grand Dukes and of the priesthood; and the\r\ndespotism of the Golden Tribe, much as it circumscribed further\r\nimprovement, strengthened the oppressed in their faith in their\r\nreligion, fidelity to their rulers, and love to their mutual\r\nfatherland.\r\n\r\nThese are still the characteristics of the people; and when\r\none reflects that the embryo of this nation, the Great\r\nRussians--thirty-six million people of one root, one faith, and one\r\nlanguage--forms the greatest homogeneous mass of people in the world,\r\nno one will doubt that Russia has a great future before her.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that with an increase of population this boundless\r\nempire must fall to pieces. But no part of it can exist without the\r\nother--the woody North without the fertile South, the industrial\r\ncentre without both, the interior without the coast, nor without the\r\ncommon joint stream, navigable for four hundred miles--the Volga. But,\r\nmore than all this, the national spirit unites the most distant\r\nportions.\r\n\r\nMoscow is now the national centre not only of the European Empire, but\r\nof the ancient and holy kingdom of the Czars, from which the\r\nhistorical reminiscences of the people spring, which, perhaps, is big\r\nwith the destinies of the future empire in spite of a deviation of two\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nThe foreign civilization which was forced upon them has never\r\npenetrated the mass of the people. The national peculiarity has\r\nremained complete in language, manners, and customs, in a highly\r\nremarkable municipal constitution, the freest and most independent\r\nexisting anywhere; and, finally, in their architecture. The last can,\r\nof course, only be applied to the churches. In Russia nearly\r\neverything is new. What is older than a hundred years is looked upon\r\nas an antiquity. The Russian dwelling-house is of wood, and therefore\r\nnever reaches that age, unless, like the one of Peter the Great, it be\r\nencased by a stone one. Even the palaces of the Emperor are new, and\r\nonly here in Moscow can be found a ruin of the old Dworez of the\r\nCzars. There are churches in existence of the fourteenth and fifteenth\r\ncenturies (a great age for Russia), and the strictly conservative\r\nspirit of the priesthood has been instrumental in retaining the same\r\nstyle of architecture in the later buildings.\r\n\r\nThe St. Sophia, in Constantinople, is the model upon which all Russian\r\nchurches are built. It was imitated everywhere, but never equalled,\r\nnot even by St. Mark's in Venice. There was lack both of material and\r\nskill to build an arch with a span of one hundred and twenty-six feet.\r\nWhat could not be accomplished in width was attempted in height. The\r\ndomes became narrow and tall, like towers. The rough stone, handled\r\nwithout art, rendered clumsy pillars and thick walls necessary, in\r\nwhich the windows, like embrasures, are cut narrow and deep. The\r\nbrightest light falls through the windows in the thinner wall which\r\nsupports the cupolas. Nearly all churches are higher than they are\r\nlong and wide. The clumsy tetragonal pillars contract the already\r\nnarrow space. One has nowhere a free view, and a mystic twilight\r\nreigns everywhere. The most famous Russian churches can only\r\naccommodate as many hundreds as a Gothic cathedral can thousands. It\r\nis true most of them were built by Italian masters; but the latter\r\nwere obliged to conform to the rules and forms already in use.\r\n\r\nSince the architectonic conditions were unfavorable to the creation of\r\na magnificent whole, an attempt was made to ornament the individual\r\nparts with brilliancy and magnificence. Not contented to gild the\r\nchurches inside and out, the floors were paved with half-precious\r\nstones, and the pictures (of no artistic value) were covered with\r\njewels, diamonds, and pearls. Only the faces and hands are painted;\r\nthe garments, crown, and all else are plated with silver, gold, and\r\njewels.\r\n\r\nSculpture is entirely prohibited, as far as representing the human\r\nform is concerned; but they do not hesitate to represent God himself\r\non canvas. The gilt background is of itself disadvantageous for the\r\ncarnation of the pictures, and added to this are the long-drawn\r\noutlines of the Byzantine and old German schools, without the genuine\r\nfeeling of the latter. Gigantic scarecrows gaze down from the cupolas,\r\nmeant to represent the Virgin Mary, Christ, St. John, or God the\r\nFather. A Russian buys no holy picture that is not quite black or\r\nfaded out. A lovely Madonna of Raphael, or a fine Sebastian of\r\nCorreggio, does not seem to him expressive. His creed needs the\r\nobscurity of his church--the clouds of incense which at every mass\r\nveil the mysterious movements of the priests.\r\n\r\nThe Byzantine element in the Russian architecture is then historically\r\neasy to explain. The Moresque originated with the necessity of\r\ndecorating the individual parts, and relates only to these.\r\n\r\nThe railings of the Ikonostase are interlaced with vines, garlands,\r\nand animal forms. The flat walls, principally where they are not gilt,\r\nare decorated with leafwork, rosettes, and twining vines. Where\r\nthis could not be cut in stone it was painted, and the deficiency in\r\ndrawing was supplied by a variety of the most glaring colors. Of\r\ncourse, they remained far behind the tasteful, artistic arabesques of\r\nthe Alhambra and the Alcazar.\r\n\r\nThe craziest thing in the way of architecture is the Church of Ivan\r\nBlajennoj, on the Red Square before the Kremlin. It cannot be\r\ndescribed. This building stands on uneven ground, although the fine\r\nlevel Place is before it. It crouches on the edge of the hill, and\r\nleaves one leg hanging down. There is no trace of any symmetry. It has\r\nno central point, and no one part is like another. One cupola looks\r\nlike an onion, another like a pineapple, an artichoke, a melon, or a\r\nTurkish turban. It contains nine different churches, each having its\r\nown altar, Ikonostase, and sanctuary. You enter several of these on\r\nthe ground floor. To reach others, you ascend a few steps. Between\r\nthese is a labyrinth of passages so narrow that two people can with\r\ndifficulty pass each other. Of course, all these churches are very\r\nnarrow. The one in the main tower can scarcely contain more than\r\ntwenty or thirty persons, and yet its vaulted roof reaches into the\r\ntower at a height of over a hundred feet. This church is painted with\r\nall the colors of the rainbow, inside and out, and plated with silver\r\nand gold. The cupolas shine with red, green, and blue glazed bricks,\r\nand even the masonry has been colored by the artist.\r\n\r\nThis monstrosity emanated from the brain of Ivan Hrosnoj, \"the\r\nTerrible John.\" When he saw the architect's work complete he was\r\ndelighted, loaded him with praise, embraced him, and then ordered his\r\neyes to be put out, that no such second masterpiece should be\r\nattributed to him.\r\n\r\nBut, with all its singularity, this church does not produce a\r\ndisagreeable impression. It cannot be denied that it is at least\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\nEverything, on the contrary, left from the old Dworez (palace) is\r\nreally beautiful. There is a strange four-story building narrowing\r\ntoward the top. There is a balcony formed by each receding story,\r\nfrom which there is a fine view. The second story contains, besides\r\nthe rich but small chapel, a banquet-hall, like the Kanter's,[40] in\r\nMarienburg, only that there the entire vaulted roof is borne by a\r\nslender column, and here by a thick pillar. The entrance is in one\r\ncorner; the throne stands diagonally opposite in the other. At\r\npresent, the walls are covered with splendid tapestries, and the great\r\nthrone draped with _drap d'or,_ lined with real ermine. This drapery\r\ncost forty thousand rubles. The small but exquisite rooms in the third\r\nstory are charming. The fourth story is only one large room. It was\r\nthe Terima, or dwelling of the women--the room in which Peter I. grew\r\nup.\r\n\r\nAt the parole delivery all the regiments were represented, the cavalry\r\nmounted. It was beautiful to see specimens of all these dazzling\r\nuniforms: the Cuirassiers, with the Byzantine double eagle upon their\r\nhelmets, something like our Garde du Corps, but with lances; the\r\nUhlans, almost exactly like ours; the Hussars, in white dolmans with\r\ngolden cords; the line Cossacks, with fur caps and red caftans; the\r\nTschernamorskish Cossacks, in dark blue coats with red jackets over\r\nthem; and the Ural ones with light blue--all with lances, on little\r\nhorses and high saddles. The Tartars are nearly all heathen or Moslem.\r\nThe Circassians appeared in scaly coats of mail and helmets. They\r\nshowed off their equestrian accomplishments, fired from the horse with\r\ntheir long guns, shielded themselves from their pursuers by their\r\nkantschu,[41] concealed themselves by throwing their bodies on one\r\nside so that they touched the ground with their hands; others stood\r\nupright in the saddle--all done at full gallop and amidst fearful\r\nnoise.\r\n\r\nA regiment of Drushins,[42] an Imperial militia levied on the\r\nImperial apanage estates, pleased me well. They wore a cap with\r\nthe cross of St. Andrew, bare neck; the native caftan, only\r\nshorter and without a button; very wide trousers, the shirt over\r\nthem (as with all common Russians), and the end of their trousers\r\ntucked into their high boots. Such is the uniformed Mujik\r\n(peasant). This dress is national, becoming and useful. The men\r\ncan wear their furs (which are here indispensable) underneath;\r\nand I will venture to say that the entire Russian infantry will\r\nadopt a similar costume. \"_Les proverbes sont l'esprit des\r\npeuples_,\" and the national dress is the result of the experience\r\nof centuries in regard to what is becoming and appropriate.\r\n\r\nThe Austrian uniform is white in Moravia and brown in the Banat,\r\nbecause the sheep there are of that color. The Spaniard wears the\r\ntabarra, as he receives the material from the goat. The Arabian is\r\nwhite from head to foot, because the heat of his climate requires it;\r\nand the Mujik does not wear his caftan from caprice, but because it\r\nsuits him best.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor's cortège is truly imposing--about five hundred horses.\r\n\r\nIf I only had a better memory for persons and names! I have made the\r\nacquaintance of a number of interesting men; that is, I have been\r\npresented to them: Prince Gortschakoff, Lueders, Berg, and\r\nOsten-Sacken, who commanded in the last war; Orloff, Mentschikoff,\r\nAlderberg, Liewen, the Governor of Siberia, and the commandant of the\r\nCaucasus; then a lot of aides-de-camp, the foreign princes, and their\r\nsuites.\r\n\r\nOne can be truly thankful if one rides a strange horse without causing\r\nor experiencing some disaster. A bad rider comes up from behind; a\r\nhorse sets himself in your way; here a mare kicks up behind; there a\r\nstallion kicks up in front. It is but a small affair to ride alone,\r\nbut in the confusion of such a train, in a short trot on a lively\r\nbeast, one must keep one's eyes open. Suddenly the Emperor stops, and\r\nthere is a general halt; or he turns to one side, and then there is\r\ngreat confusion; he gallops forward, and all plunge after him, while\r\nthe head of the column has again taken a short movement. With all\r\nthis the flags are flying, the trumpets are blowing, the drums are\r\nbeating, and there are endless hurrahs. But one must also see\r\nsomething. I rode a little black horse that I would like to possess;\r\nhe goes like an East Prussian, but is very spirited, and I constantly\r\nfound myself in the front among the grand dukes. But I shall get on\r\nwell with him when we know each other better. He needs a quiet rider\r\nwith a firm seat, and a light hand on the reins.\r\n\r\nThis evening at sunset, I again ascended the Kremlin. _\"Diem perdidi\"_\r\nI should say of the day of my sojourn there in which I did not visit\r\nthis wonderful structure.\r\n\r\nI descended to the Moskwa, and, from under the fine quay, examined the\r\nmassive white walls, the towers and the gate forts which surround the\r\nCzar's palace, and a whole town of churches of the strangest\r\nstructure. Tonight the city gives a grand entertainment, from which I\r\nshall absent myself to write. One receives so many impressions that it\r\nis impossible to digest them all and collect one's thoughts.\r\n\r\nI am trying to understand this architecture. In Culm, in West Prussia,\r\nI saw last year in the marketplace such a curious City Hall that I\r\ncould not reconcile it in my mind; now I understand that it is\r\nMoscovite architecture. The Knights of the Sword of Liefland were in\r\nintimate connection with the German Knights in Prussia, and one of\r\ntheir architects may have repeated on the Vistula what he had seen on\r\nthe Moskwa.\r\n\r\nThe fountains here remind one of the East; little, round covered\r\nhouses on the principal squares, which are constantly surrounded by\r\nmen and beasts supplying themselves with water. At first they seem\r\nrude and awkward when compared with the fine style, the rich\r\nsculpture, the golden railings, and the perforated marble walls of the\r\nTschesmas of Constantinople. There are here, as in the mosques, swarms\r\nof doves that are so bold that they scarcely leave room for carriages\r\nand foot-passengers. They are often chased out of the shops like a\r\nbrood of chickens, and they go everywhere for food. No one does them\r\nany harm, and the Russians think it a sin to eat them. The Gostinoy\r\nDwor (the merchants' court) is especially a repetition of the Oriental\r\nTschurchi. One booth is next to the other, and the narrow passages\r\nthat separate them are covered; therefore the same dim light and the\r\nsame smell of leather and spices exist as at the Missir, or Egyptian\r\nmarket, in Constantinople. The wares here, however, are mostly\r\nEuropean, and cheaper at home, so that we are not much tempted to buy.\r\n\r\nIf I had my choice, I would rather live in Moscow than in St.\r\nPetersburg.\r\n\r\nPeter the Great found an island without any seacoast. He could look\r\nupon the Black Sea or the Baltic as a communication with the civilized\r\nworld; but one or the other must first be conquered. The hot-headed\r\nKing of Sweden pressed him to a Northern war, and, besides, the\r\nSouthern Sea was inhabited by barbarians. His original intention, it\r\nis said, was to build his new capital on the Pontus, and that he even\r\nhad selected the spot. The one coast, indeed, is not much farther from\r\nthe centre of the empire than the other.\r\n\r\nHow would it have been had he built his St. Petersburg on the\r\nbeautiful harbor of Sebastopol, close to the paradisiac heights of the\r\nTschadyr Dagh, where the grape grows wild and everything flourishes in\r\nthe open air that is forced through a greenhouse on the Neva; where no\r\nfloods threaten destruction; where the navy is not frozen fast during\r\nseven months of the year; and where steam power makes an easier\r\ncommunication with the most beautiful countries of Europe than the\r\nGulf of Finland does?\r\n\r\nWhat a city would St. Petersburg have been, did her wide streets\r\nextend to Balaklava and did the Winter Palace face the deep blue\r\nmirror of the Black Sea; if the Isaac Church stood at the height of\r\nMalakoff; if Aluschta and Orianda were the Peterhof and Gatschina[43]\r\nof the Imperial family!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PEACE MOVEMENT\r\n\r\nTRANSLATED BY EDMUND VON MACH, PH.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Professor Bluntschli had sent the manual of the Institute of\r\nInternational Law to Count Moltke, and expressed the hope, in a letter\r\ndated November 19, 1880, that it would meet with his approval. Count\r\nMoltke replied as follows:]\r\n\r\nMy dear Professor:\r\n\r\nYou have been good enough to send me the manual published by the\r\nInstitute of International Law, and you ask for my approval. In the\r\nfirst place, I fully recognize your humane endeavors to lessen the\r\nsufferings which war brings in its train.\r\n\r\nEternal peace, however, is a dream, and not even a beautiful dream,\r\nfor war is part of God's scheme of the world. In war the noblest\r\nvirtues of man develop courage and renunciation, the sense of duty and\r\nabnegation, and all at the risk of his life. Without war the world\r\nwould be swallowed up in the morass of materialism.\r\n\r\nWith the principle stated in the preface, that the gradual advance of\r\ncivilization should be reflected in the conduct of war, I fully agree;\r\nbut I go further, and believe that civilization alone, and no codified\r\nlaws of warfare, can have the desired result.\r\n\r\nEvery law necessitates an authority to watch over it and to direct its\r\nexecution, but there is no power which can enforce obedience to\r\ninternational agreements. Which third state will take up arms because\r\none--or both--of two powers at war with each other have broken the\r\n_loi de la guerre?_ The human judge is lacking. In these matters we\r\ncan hope for success only from the religious and moral education of\r\nthe individuals, and the honor and sense of right of the leaders, who\r\nmake their own laws and act according to them, at least to the extent\r\nto which the abnormal conditions of war permit it.\r\n\r\nNobody, I think, can deny that the general softening of men's manners\r\nhas been followed by a more humane way of waging war.\r\n\r\nCompare, if you will, the coarseness of the Thirty Years' War with the\r\nbattles of recent dates.\r\n\r\nThe introduction in our generation of universal service in the army\r\nhas marked a long step in the direction of the desired aim, for it has\r\nbrought also the educated classes into the army. Some rough and\r\nviolent elements have survived, it is true, but the army no longer\r\nconsists of them exclusively.\r\n\r\nThe governments, moreover, have two means at hand to prevent the worst\r\nexcesses. A strong discipline, practiced and perfected in times of\r\npeace, and a commissariat equipped to provide for the troops in the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nWithout careful provision, discipline itself can be only moderately\r\nwell enforced. The soldier who suffers pain and hunger, fatigue and\r\ndanger, cannot take merely _en proportion avec les ressources du\r\npays,_ but he must take whatever he needs. You must not ask of him\r\nsuperhuman things.\r\n\r\nThe greatest blessing in war is its speedy termination, and to this\r\nend all means must be permitted which are not downright criminal. I\r\ncannot at all give my approval to the _Déclaration de St.\r\nPetersbourg_, that \"the weakening of the hostile army\" is the only\r\njustifiable procedure in war. On the contrary, all resources of the\r\nhostile government must be attacked--its finances, railways,\r\nprovisions, and even its prestige.\r\n\r\nThe last war against France was waged in this way, and yet with\r\ngreater moderation than any earlier war. The campaign was decided\r\nafter two months; and fierceness became characteristic of the fighting\r\nonly when a revolutionary government continued the war through four\r\nmore months, to the detriment of the country.\r\n\r\nI am glad to acknowledge that your manual, with its clear and short\r\nsentences, does greater justice than former attempts to what is needed\r\nin war. But even the acceptance of your regulations by the governments\r\nwould not ensure their observance. It has long been a universally\r\naccepted rule of warfare that no messenger of peace should be shot at.\r\nBut in the last campaign we frequently saw this done.\r\n\r\nNo paragraph learned by heart will convince the soldier that the\r\nunorganized natives who _spontanément_ (that is, of their own free\r\nwill) take up arms and threaten his life every moment of the day and\r\nnight should be recognized as lawful opponents.\r\n\r\nCertain requests of the manual, I fear, cannot be put in force. The\r\nidentification, for instance, of the dead after a big battle. Others\r\nare subject to doubt, unless you insert _\"lorsque les circonstances le\r\npermettent, s'il se peut, si possible, s'il-y-a nécessité,\"_ or the\r\nlike. This will give them that elasticity without which the bitter\r\nseverity of actual warfare will break through all restrictions.\r\n\r\nIn war, where everything must be treated individually, only those\r\nregulations will work well which are primarily addressed to the\r\nleaders. This includes everything that your manual has to say\r\nconcerning the wounded and the sick, the physicians and their\r\nmedicines. The general recognition of these principles, and also of\r\nthose which have to do with the prisoners of war, would mark a notable\r\nstep in advance and bring us nearer the end which the Institute of\r\nInternational Law is pursuing with such admirable perseverance.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully,\r\n\r\nCOUNT MOLTKE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: From _Count Moltke's Letters from Russia_, permission\r\nHarper & Brothers, New York.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: Kopecks are equal to about one cent each.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: A part of the castle in Marienburg, Prussia, containing\r\nthe hall where the knights of the German order, \"Deutsche Ritter,\"\r\nheld their conclaves; also the hall itself, one of the showplaces of\r\nEastern Prussia.--TRANSLATOR.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: A whip with short handle and long thong.--TRANSLATOR.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: Militia of the Emperor, but differently constituted from\r\nthe American militia or Prussian Landwehr.--TRANSLATOR.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: One of the summer palaces of the Emperor.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIGHTING ON THE FRONTIER[44]\r\n\r\nTRANSLATED BY CLARA BELL AND HENRY W. FISCHER\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARATIONS FOR WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe days are gone by when, for dynastical ends, small armies of\r\nprofessional soldiers went to war to conquer a city, or a province,\r\nand then sought winter quarters or made peace. The wars of the present\r\nday call whole nations to arms, there is scarcely a family that does\r\nnot suffer by them. The entire financial resources of the State are\r\nappropriated to the purpose, and the different seasons of the year\r\nhave no bearing on the unceasing progress of hostilities. As long as\r\nnations continue independent of each other there will be disagreements\r\nthat can only be settled by force of arms; but, in the interest of\r\nhumanity, it is to be hoped that wars will become less frequent, as\r\nthey have become more terrible.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, it is no longer the ambition of monarchs which\r\nendangers peace; the passions of the people, its dissatisfaction with\r\ninterior conditions and affairs, the strife of parties, and the\r\nintrigues of their leaders are the causes. A declaration of war, so\r\nserious in its consequences, is more easily carried by a large\r\nassembly, of which none of the members bears the sole responsibility,\r\nthan by a single man, however high his position; and a peace-loving\r\nsovereign is less rare than a parliament composed of wise men. The\r\ngreat wars of the present day have been declared against the wish and will\r\nof the reigning powers. Now-a-days the Bourse has assumed such influence\r\nthat it has the power to call armies into the field merely to protect its\r\ninterests. Mexico and Egypt have been swamped with European armies simply\r\nto satisfy the demands of the _haute finance_. Today the question, \"Is a\r\nnation strong enough to make war?\" is of less importance than that, \"Is\r\nits Government powerful enough to prevent war?\" Thus, united Germany has,\r\nup to now, used her strength only to maintain European peace; a weak\r\nGovernment at the head of our neighboring State must, on the other\r\nhand, be regarded in the light of a standing menace to peace.\r\n\r\nThe war of 1870-71 arose from just such relations. A Napoleon on the\r\nthrone of France was bound to establish his rights by political and\r\nmilitary success. Only for a time did the victories won by French arms\r\nin distant countries give general satisfaction; the triumphs of the\r\nPrussian armies excited jealousy, they were regarded as arrogant, as a\r\nchallenge; and the French demanded revenge for Sadowa. The liberal\r\nspirit of the epoch was opposed to the autocratic Government of the\r\nEmperor; he was forced to make concessions, his civil authority was\r\nweakened, and one fine day the nation was informed by its\r\nrepresentatives that it desired war with Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARATIONS FOR THE WAR\r\n\r\nThe wars carried on by France on the other side of the ocean, simply\r\nfor financial ends, had consumed immense sums and had undermined the\r\ndiscipline of the army. The French were by no means _archiprêts_ for a\r\ngreat war, but the Spanish succession to the throne, nevertheless, had\r\nto serve as a pretext to declare it. The French Reserves were called\r\nto arms July 15th, and only four days later the French declaration of\r\nwar was handed in at Berlin, as though this were an opportunity not to\r\nbe lost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KING WILLIAM AT THE MAUSOLEUM OF HIS PARENTS ON THE DAY\r\nOF THE FRENCH DECLARATION OF WAR ANTON VON WERNER]\r\n\r\nOne Division was ordered to the Spanish frontier as a corps of\r\nobservation; only such troops as were absolutely necessary were left\r\nin Algiers and in Civita Vecchia; Paris and Lyons were sufficiently\r\ngarrisoned. The entire remainder of the army: 332 battalions, 220\r\nsquadrons, 924 cannon, in all about 300,000 men, formed the army of\r\nthe Rhine. This was divided into eight Corps, which, at any rate in\r\nthe first instance, were to be directed by one central head, without\r\nany kind of intervention. The _Imperator_ himself was the only person\r\nto assume this difficult task; Marshal Bazaine was to command the army\r\nas it assembled, until the Emperor's arrival.\r\n\r\nIt is very probable that the French were counting on the old\r\ndissensions of the German races. True, they dared not look upon the\r\nSouth Germans as allies, but they hoped to reduce them to inactivity\r\nby an early victory, or even to win them over to their side. Prussia\r\nwas a powerful antagonist even when isolated, and her army more\r\nnumerous than that of the French, but this advantage might be\r\ncounterbalanced by rapidity of action.\r\n\r\nThe French plan of campaign was indeed based on the delivery of\r\nunforeseen attacks. The strong fleets of war and transport ships were\r\nto be utilized to land a considerable force in Northern Prussia, and\r\nthere engage a part of the Prussian troops, while the main body of the\r\narmy, it was supposed, would await the French attack behind the\r\nfortresses on the Rhine. The French intended to cross the Rhine at\r\nonce, at and below Strassburg, thus avoiding the great fortresses; and\r\nalso, at the start, preventing the South-German army, which was\r\ndestined to defend the Black Forest, from uniting with the\r\nNorth-Germans. To execute this plan it would have been imperative to\r\nassemble the main forces of the French army in Alsace. Railway\r\naccommodation, however, was so inadequate that in the first instance\r\nit was only possible to carry 100,000 men to Strassburg; 150,000 had\r\nto leave the railways near Metz, and remain there till they could be\r\nmoved up. Fifty thousand men were encamped at Châlons as reserves,\r\n115 battalions were ready to march as soon as the National Guard had\r\ntaken their places in the interior. The various corps were distributed\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nImperial Guard, General Bourbaki--Nancy.\r\n\r\nIst Corps, Marshal MacMahon--Strassburg.\r\n\r\nIId Corps, General Frossard--St. Avold.\r\n\r\nIIId Corps, Marshal Bazaine--Metz.\r\n\r\nIVth Corps, General Ladmirault--Diedenhofen.\r\n\r\nVth Corps, General Failly--Bitsch.\r\n\r\nVIth Corps, Marshal Canrobert--Châlons.\r\n\r\nVIIth Corps, General Félix Douay--Belfort.\r\n\r\nThus there were only two Corps in Alsace, and five on the Moselle;\r\nand, on the day of the declaration of war, one of these, the IId\r\nCorps, was pushed forward close to the German frontier, near St. Avold\r\nand Forbach. This IId Corps, however, received instructions not to\r\nengage in any serious conflict.\r\n\r\nThe regiments had marched out of quarters incomplete as to numbers,\r\nand insufficiently equipped. Meanwhile the reserves called out to fill\r\ntheir place had choked the railway traffic; they crowded the depôts,\r\nand filled the railway stations.\r\n\r\nThe progress to their destination was delayed, for it was often\r\nunknown at the railway stations where the regiments to which the\r\nreserves were to be sent were at the time encamped. When they at last\r\njoined they were without the most necessary articles of equipment. The\r\nCorps and Divisions had no artillery or baggage, no ambulances, and\r\nonly a very insufficient number of officers. No magazines had been\r\nestablished beforehand, and the troops were to depend on the\r\nfortresses. These were but ill-supplied, for in the assured\r\nexpectation that the armies would be almost immediately sent on into\r\nthe enemy's country they had been neglected.\r\n\r\nIn the same way the Staff-officers had been provided with maps of\r\nGermany, but not of their own provinces. The Ministry of War in Paris\r\nwas inundated with claims, protestations, and expostulations, and\r\nfinally it was left to the troops to help themselves as best they\r\ncould. _On se débrouillera_ was the hope of the authorities.\r\n\r\nWhen the Emperor arrived at Metz, a week after the declaration of war,\r\nthe regiments were not yet complete, and it was not even exactly known\r\nwhere whole Divisions were at that time encamped. The Emperor ordered\r\nthe troops to advance, but his Marshals declared that the condition of\r\nthe troops made this impossible for the time being.\r\n\r\nIt was gradually dawning upon them that, instead of attacking the\r\nenemy in his country, they would have to defend their own. Rumor had\r\nit, that a strong army of the enemy had assembled between Mayence and\r\nCoblentz; instead of sending reinforcements from Metz to Strassburg,\r\nthey were ordered to proceed from the Rhine to the Saar. The\r\ndetermination to invade South Germany was already abandoned; the fleet\r\nhad sailed round, but without any troops to land.\r\n\r\nGermany had been surprised by the declaration of war, but she was not\r\nunprepared. The possibility of such an event had been foreseen.\r\n\r\nWhen Austria had separated her interests from those of the other\r\nGerman states, Prussia undertook the sole leadership, and paved the\r\nway to more intimate relations with the South-German states. The idea\r\nof national unification had been revived, and found an echo in the\r\npatriotic sentiments of the entire people.\r\n\r\nThe means of mobilizing the North-German army had been reviewed year\r\nby year, in view of any changes in the military or political\r\nsituation, by the Staff, in conjunction with the Ministry of War.\r\nEvery branch of the administration throughout the country had been\r\nkept informed of all it ought to know of these matters. The Berlin\r\nauthorities had likewise come to a confidential understanding with the\r\narmy chiefs of the South-German states on all important points. It\r\nhad been conceded that Prussia was not to be reckoned on for the\r\ndefence of any particular point, as the Black Forest, for instance;\r\nand it was decided that the best way of protecting South Germany would\r\nbe by an incursion into Alsace across the central part of the Rhine;\r\nwhich could be backed up by the main force assembled at that point.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the Governments of Bavaria, Würtemberg, Baden, and\r\nHesse, denuding their own countries as it were, were ready to place\r\ntheir contingents under the command of King William proves their\r\nentire confidence in the Prussian generals.\r\n\r\nAs soon as this understanding was arrived at the other preparations\r\ncould be made. The orders for marching, and traveling by rail or boat,\r\nwere worked out for each division of the army, together with the most\r\nminute directions as to their different starting points, the day and\r\nhour of departure, the duration of the journey, the refreshment\r\nstations, and place of destination. At the meeting-point cantonments\r\nwere assigned to each Corps and Division, stores and magazines were\r\nestablished; and thus, when war was declared, it needed only the Royal\r\nsignature to set the entire apparatus in motion with undisturbed\r\nprecision. There was nothing to be changed in the directions\r\noriginally given; it sufficed to carry out the plans prearranged and\r\nprepared.\r\n\r\nThe mobilized forces were divided into three independent armies on a\r\nbasis worked out by the general of the Prussian staff.\r\n\r\nThe First Army, under the command of General von Steinmetz, consisted\r\nof the VIIth and VIIIth Corps, and one division of cavalry; 60,000 men\r\nall told. It was ordered to encamp at Wittlich and form the right\r\nwing.\r\n\r\nThe Second Army, under the command of Prince Frederick Charles, was\r\n131,000 strong, and constituted the central army. It consisted of the\r\nIIId, IVth, and Xth Corps of Guards, and two divisions of cavalry. Its\r\nmeeting-point was in the vicinity of Homburg and Neunkirchen. The\r\nThird Army, under the command of the Crown Prince of Prussia, was to\r\nform the left wing, near Landau and Rastat, a strength of about\r\n130,000 men. It consisted of the Vth and XIth Prussian, and the Ist\r\nand IId Bavarian Corps, the Würtemberg and the Baden Field Divisions,\r\nand one division of cavalry.\r\n\r\nThe IXth Corps, consisting of the 18th and the Hesse divisions, was\r\nunited with the XIIth Royal Saxon Corps to form a reserve of 60,000\r\nmen, and was encamped before Mayence, to reinforce the Second Army,\r\nwhich was thus brought up to the strength of 194,000 men.\r\n\r\nThe three armies combined numbered 384,000 men.\r\n\r\nThere were still the Ist, IId, and IVth Corps, 100,000 men; but they\r\nwere not at first included, as the means of railway transport were\r\nengaged for twenty-one days.\r\n\r\nThe 17th Division and the Landwehr troops were told off to defend the\r\ncoast. During the night of July 16th the Royal order for the\r\nmobilization of the army was issued, and when His Majesty arrived in\r\nMayence, a fortnight later, he found 300,000 men assembled on and in\r\nfront of the Rhine.\r\n\r\nIn his plan of war, submitted by the Chief of the General Staff, and\r\naccepted by the King, that officer had his eye fixed, from the first,\r\nupon the capture of the enemy's capital, the possession of which is of\r\nmore importance in France than in other countries. On the way thither\r\nthe hostile forces were to be driven as persistently as possible back\r\nfrom the fertile southern states into the narrower tract on the north.\r\n\r\nBut above all the plan of war was based on the resolve to attack the\r\nenemy at once, wherever found, and keep the German forces so compact\r\nthat a superior force could always be brought into the field. By\r\nwhatever special means these plans were to be accomplished was left to\r\nthe decision of the hour; the advance to the frontiers alone was\r\npreordained in every detail.\r\n\r\nIt is a delusion to believe that a plan of war may be laid for a\r\nprolonged period and carried out in every point. The first collision\r\nwith the enemy changes the situation entirely, according to the\r\nresult. Some things decided upon will be impracticable; others, which\r\noriginally seemed impossible, become feasible. All that the leader of\r\nan army can do is to get a clear view of the circumstances, to decide\r\nfor the best for an unknown period, and carry out his purpose\r\nunflinchingly.\r\n\r\nThe departure of the French troops to the frontier, before they were\r\nthoroughly prepared for service in the field, which is a very serious\r\nstep to take, was evidently ordered for the purpose of surprising the\r\nGerman army, with the forces immediately at command, and thus\r\ninterfering with the formation of their advance. But, in spite of\r\nthis, the German commanders did not deviate from their purpose of\r\nmassing their armies on the Rhine and crossing that river. The railway\r\ntransport of the troops of the IId and IIId Corps, however, was to end\r\nat the Rhine; thence they were to march on foot into the cantonments\r\nprepared on the left bank of the river. They moved in echelon,\r\nadvancing only so many at a time as would make room for the Division\r\nbehind them, as far as the line marked by the towns of Bingen,\r\nDürkheim, and Landau.\r\n\r\nThe final advance towards the frontier was not to be undertaken until\r\nthe Divisions and Corps were all collected, and provided with the\r\nall-necessary baggage train; and then proceed in a state of readiness\r\nto confront the enemy at any moment.\r\n\r\nThe assembling of the First Army appeared to be less threatened, as\r\nits route lay through neutral territory, and was protected by the\r\ngarrisons of Trèves, Saarlouis, and Saarbrücken, the German outposts\r\non the Saar.\r\n\r\nThe First Army, 50,000 strong, was concentrated at Wadern, in the\r\nfirst days of August. The Second Army, which meanwhile had been\r\nincreased to a strength of 194,000 men, had pushed forward its\r\ncantonments to Alsenz-Günnstadt, at the termination of the Haardt\r\nMountains, a position which had been thoroughly reconnoitered by an\r\nofficer of the Staff, and where the troops might boldly await an\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nThe 5th and 6th Cavalry Divisions were reconnoitering the country in\r\nfront. The regiments and squadrons of the Third Army were still\r\ngathering on both banks of the Rhine.\r\n\r\nThe French so far had made no serious attempt at Saarbrücken;\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Pestel was able to successfully withstand their\r\npetty attacks with one battalion and three squadrons of cavalry.\r\n\r\nIt had meanwhile been observed that the French were moving further to\r\nthe right, toward Forbach and Bitsch, which seemed to indicate that\r\nthe two French Corps, known to be drawn up at Belfort and Strassburg,\r\nmight purpose crossing the Rhine and marching on the Black Forest. It\r\nwas therefore of very great importance to set the Third Army moving at\r\nthe earliest opportunity, first to protect the right bank of the Upper\r\nRhine by an advance on the left; secondly to cover the progress of the\r\nSecond Army towards that point.\r\n\r\nA telegraphic order to that effect was dispatched on the evening of\r\nJuly 30th, but the General in command of the Third Army Corps desired\r\nto wait for the arrival of the Fourth and its baggage train. In spite\r\nof this hesitancy the Second Army was ordered to proceed towards the\r\nSaar, where the French were showing much uneasiness.\r\n\r\nThe time had gone by when they might have taken advantage of their\r\nover-hasty mobilization; the condition of the men had prohibited any\r\naction. France was waiting for news of a victory; something had to be\r\ndone to appease public impatience, so, in order to do something, the\r\nenemy resolved (as is usual under such circumstances) on a hostile\r\nreconnoissance, and, it may be added, with the usual result.\r\n\r\nOn August 2d three entire Divisions were sent forward against three\r\nbattalions, four squadrons, and one battery in Saarbrücken. The\r\nEmperor himself and the Prince Imperial watched the operations. The\r\nIIId Corps advanced on Völklingen, the Vth on Saargemünd, the IId on\r\nSaarbrücken.\r\n\r\nThe Germans evacuated Saarbrücken after a gallant defence and repeated\r\nsorties, but the French did not cross the Saar. They may have\r\nconvinced themselves that they had wasted their strength by hitting in\r\nthe air, and had gained no information as to the resources and\r\nposition of the enemy.\r\n\r\nAfter this the French generals hesitated for a long while between\r\ncontrary resolutions. Orders were given and recalled on the strength\r\nof mere rumors. The left wing was reinforced on account of a current\r\nstory that 40,000 Prussians had marched through Trèves, the Guards\r\nreceived contradictory orders, and, when a small German force showed\r\nitself at Lörrach in the Black Forest, it was at once decreed that the\r\nVIIth Corps must remain in Alsace. Thus the French forces were spread\r\nover the wide area between the Nied and the Upper Rhine, while the\r\nGermans were advancing in compact masses on the Saar.\r\n\r\nThis scattered state of the army finally induced the French leaders to\r\ndivide their forces into two distinct armies. Marshal MacMahon took\r\nprovisional command of the Ist, VIIth, and Vth Corps, the latter being\r\nwithdrawn from Bitsch. The other Divisions were placed under Marshal\r\nBazaine, with the exception of the Guards, the command of which the\r\nEmperor reserved to himself.\r\n\r\nIt had now become a pressing necessity to protect the left wing of the\r\nadvancing Second German Army against the French forces in Alsace; the\r\nThird Army was therefore ordered to cross the frontier on August 4th,\r\nwithout waiting any longer for the batteries to come up. The First\r\nArmy, forming the right wing, was already encamped near Wadern and\r\nLosheim, three or four days' march nearer to the Saar than the Second\r\nArmy in the centre. They were ordered to concentrate in the\r\nneighborhood of Tholey and there await further orders. In the first\r\nplace this, the weakest of the two Divisions, was not to be exposed\r\nsingle-handed to an attack of the enemy's main force; and, secondly,\r\nit was to be used for a flank-movement in case the Second Army should\r\nmeet the enemy on emerging from the forests of the Palatinate.\r\n\r\nTo execute this order, the First Army had to extend its cantonments in\r\na southerly direction as far as the line of march of the Second Army,\r\nand evacuate its quarters near Ottweiler. This was a difficult matter\r\nto accomplish, as all the towns and villages to the north were\r\nbilleted, and quarters had also to be found for the Ist Corps, now\r\nadvancing by the Birkenfeld route. General von Steinmetz therefore\r\ndecided to march his entire forces in the direction of Saarlouis and\r\nSaarbrücken. The Second Army had assembled, and was ready for action\r\non August 4th, and received orders to take the field on the farther\r\nside of the wooded zone of Kaiserslautern.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: From _The Franco-German War of 1870-71._ Permission\r\nHarper & Brothers, New York and London.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF GRAVELOTTE--ST. PRIVAT[45]\r\n\r\nAugust 18th\r\n\r\nTRANSLATED BY CLARA BELL AND HENRY W. FISCHER\r\n\r\n\r\nMarshal Bazaine had not thought it advisable to proceed to Verdun now\r\nthat the Germans were so close on the flank of such a movement. He\r\npreferred to assemble his forces at Metz, in a position which he\r\nrightly supposed to be almost impregnable.\r\n\r\nSuch a position was afforded by the range of hills, bordering on the\r\nwest of the valley of Chatel. That side facing the enemy sloped away\r\nlike a _glacis_, while the short and steep decline behind offered\r\nprotection for the reserves. The IId, IIId, IVth and VIth Corps were\r\nplaced on the ridge of the hills between Roncourt and Rozereuilles, a\r\ndistance of one mile and a half (German); thus there were eight or ten\r\nmen to every yard of ground.\r\n\r\nA brigade of the Vth Corps stood at Ste.-Ruffine in the valley of the\r\nMoselle, the cavalry in the rear of the two wings.\r\n\r\nThe positions of the IId and IIId Corps were hastily entrenched,\r\nbatteries and covered ways were established, and the farmhouses in\r\nfront prepared for defense. To approach this left wing from the west\r\nit was necessary to cross the deep valley of the Mance. The VIth Corps\r\non the other hand had no engineering tools; and it is indicative of\r\nthe general ill-equipment of the French that, merely to convey the\r\nwounded to the rear, in spite of the enormous baggage-train, provision\r\nwagons had to be unloaded and their contents burnt. This Corps was\r\ntherefore unable to construct such defenses on the side overlooking\r\nthe forest of Jaumont as were necessary to strengthen the right wing.\r\nThis would undoubtedly have been the place for the Guards, but in his\r\nfear of an attack from the south, Marshal Bazaine kept them in reserve\r\nat Plappeville.\r\n\r\nThe King again arrived at Flavigny at six o'clock on the morning of\r\nthe 18th. All officers in command were ordered to report directly to\r\nheadquarters, and Staff-officers of Army Headquarters were despatched\r\nin all directions to watch the progress of the engagement.\r\n\r\nThe VIIth army Corps, forming the pivot upon which the intended wheel\r\nto the right was to be effected, occupied the Bois de Vaux and Bois\r\ndes Ognons; the 8th, under the personal command of the King, halted at\r\nRezonville, ready to proceed to the north or east, as might be\r\nrequired. The IXth Corps, on its left, advanced toward the Marcel,\r\nwhile the IIId and Xth formed the second line. The Guards and XIIth\r\nCorps moved in a northerly direction.\r\n\r\nA serious delay occurred when the XIIth Corps of the Second Army,\r\nwhich was stationed on the right, was commanded to form the left wing,\r\nby the crossing of the two on the march. The Saxon troops did not get\r\nthrough Mars-la-Tour until nine o'clock, and till then the Guards\r\ncould not follow.\r\n\r\nThe advanced guard of the XIIth Corps had meanwhile reached Jarny, and\r\nproceeded as far as Briey without encountering the enemy.\r\n\r\nBefore this could be known, the authorities at headquarters had been\r\nconvinced that at least the main forces of the enemy were still at\r\nMetz; misapprehension, however, prevailed as to the extension of their\r\nlines, and it was thought the French front did not reach beyond\r\nMontigny. The general in command of the Second Army was therefore\r\ninstructed not to proceed further northward, but to join the IXth\r\nCorps in attacking the enemy's right wing, and move in the direction\r\nof Batilly with the Guards and the XIIth Corps. The First Army was\r\nnot to attack in the front until the Second was ready to strike.\r\n\r\nIn obedience to this, Prince Frederick Charles ordered the IXth Corps\r\nto march on to Verneville, and, in case the French right wing should\r\nbe found there, to open battle by bringing a large force of artillery\r\ninto action. The Guards were to continue their advance _via_ Doncourt\r\nto reinforce the IXth as soon as possible. The XIIth was to remain at\r\nJarny for the present.\r\n\r\nA little later fresh reports came in which indicated that the IXth\r\nCorps, if proceeding in the manner ordered, would come upon the French\r\ncentre, instead of their right wing. The Prince therefore determined\r\nthat the Corps should postpone the attack till the Guards had done so\r\nat Amanvillers. At the same time the XIIth Corps was pushed on to\r\nSte.-Marie-aux-Chênes.\r\n\r\nBut, while these orders were being given, the first heavy firing was\r\nheard at Verneville. This was at twelve o 'clock.\r\n\r\nThe two Corps on the left had, of their own accord, taken an easterly\r\ndirection without waiting for orders, and the IId Corps moved up\r\nbehind the IXth at the farm of Caulre.\r\n\r\nGeneral von Manstein, in command of the IXth, had observed from near\r\nVerneville a French encampment at Amanvillers, apparently in a state\r\nof quietude. From that point of view the great masses of troops on\r\ntheir immediate left at St.-Privat were not visible. Mistaking this\r\ncamp for the right wing, he determined to act on his first orders and\r\ntake the foe by surprise. Eight of his batteries at once opened fire.\r\n\r\nBut it did not take the French troops long to move into the position\r\nassigned to them. The independent action of a single Corps naturally\r\nexposed it not only to the fire of the troops opposite, but to an\r\nattack in flank.\r\n\r\nTo obtain some shelter on the field, the Prussian batteries had taken\r\nup a position on the shoulder of the hill below Amanvillers facing the\r\nsoutheast, where they were exposed from the north, on the flank, and\r\neven in the rear to the fire of French artillery, as well as to the\r\nconcentrated fire of their infantry.\r\n\r\nTo meet this, the battalions nearest at hand were ordered forward.\r\nThey took possession of the eastern point of the Bois de la Cusse on\r\nthe left, and on the right seized the farmhouses of L'Envie and\r\nChantrenne, forcing their way into the Bois des Genivaux. Thus the\r\nline of battle of the 18th Division gained a front of 4,000 paces.\r\n\r\nIts losses were very great, for the French with their long-range\r\nChassepôt rifles could afford to keep out of range of the needle-gun;\r\nthe artillery especially suffered severely. One of the batteries had\r\nalready lost forty-five gunners when it was attacked by French\r\nsharpshooters. There was no infantry at hand to retaliate, and two\r\nguns were lost. By two o'clock all the batteries were almost\r\n_hors-de-combat_, and no relief arrived till the Hessian Division\r\nreached Habonville, and brought up five batteries on either side of\r\nthe railway, thus diverting on themselves the concentrated fire of the\r\nenemy. The batteries of the 18th Division, which had suffered most,\r\ncould now be withdrawn in succession, but even in their retreat they\r\nhad to defend themselves against their pursuers by grapeshot.\r\n\r\nThe artillery of the IIId Corps and the Guards were likewise sent to\r\nthe assistance of the IXth, and those of the damaged guns which were\r\nstill fit for service were at once brought into line. Thus a front of\r\n130 guns was drawn up before Verneville as far as St.-Ail, and its\r\nfire soon told upon the enemy. Now, when the IIId Corps was\r\napproaching Verneville and the 3d Brigade of Guards had reached\r\nHabonville, there was no fear that the French would break through the\r\nline.\r\n\r\nThe main force of the Guards had arrived at St.-Ail as early as two\r\no'clock. General von Pape at once saw that by wheeling to the east he\r\nwould not encounter the right wing of the French, which was to be\r\nout-flanked, but would expose his own left wing to the forces\r\noccupying Ste.-Marie-aux-Chênes. The first thing to be done was to\r\ngain possession of this village--almost a town. It was strongly\r\noccupied and well flanked by the main position of the French army;\r\nbut, in obedience to superior orders, he must await the arrival of a\r\ncoöperative Saxon contingent.\r\n\r\nThe advance guard of this Corps had already reached the vicinity of\r\nBatilly, but was yet half a mile distant from Ste.-Marie, so its\r\nbatteries could not be placed in position west of the town until three\r\no'clock. But, as the Guards had sent most of their own artillery to\r\nthe support of the IXth Corps, this was substantial aid.\r\n\r\nTen batteries now opened fire upon Ste.-Marie, and by the time it was\r\nbeginning to tell the 47th Brigade of the XIIth Corps came up. At\r\nhalf-past three the Prussian and Saxon battalions stormed the town\r\nfrom the south and west and north, amid vociferous cheers, and without\r\nfurther returning the fire of the enemy. The French were driven from\r\nthe place, and a few hundred were taken prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe Saxons tried to follow them up, and a lively infantry engagement\r\nensued, north of Ste.-Marie, which masked the artillery. As soon as\r\nthe brigade had been ordered to retire, the batteries reopened fire,\r\nand the repeated efforts of the French to regain the lost position\r\nwere frustrated.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards the IXth Corps succeeded in taking and holding the\r\nfarm of Champenois, but all further attempts, by isolated battalions\r\nor companies, to force their way on against the broad and compact\r\ncentre of the French were, on the face of it, futile. Thus, by about\r\nfive o'clock, the infantry ceased fire, and the artillery only fired\r\nan occasional shot. Fatigue on both sides caused an almost total\r\nsuspension of hostilities in this part of the field.\r\n\r\nThe Commander-in-Chief decided that the First Army should not engage\r\nin serious assault until the Second stood close to the enemy; but when\r\nthe day was half-spent and brisk firing was heard about noon from\r\nVionville, it was to be supposed that the time for action had arrived;\r\nstill, for the present permission was only given to send forward the\r\nartillery in preparation for the fight. Sixteen batteries of the\r\nVIIth and VIIIth Corps accordingly drew up to right and left of the\r\nhighway running through Gravelotte. Their fire was ineffective, as\r\nthey were too far from the enemy; besides they were suffering from the\r\nfire of the French tirailleurs, who had established themselves in the\r\nopposite woods. It became necessary to drive them out, so here again\r\nthere was a sharp skirmish. The French had to abandon the eastern\r\nportion of the Mance valley, and the artillery, now increased to\r\ntwenty batteries, was able to advance to the western ridge and direct\r\nits fire against the main position of the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe battalions of the 29th Brigade followed up this advantage. They\r\npressed forward into the southern part of the Bois des Genivaux on the\r\nleft, but were unable to effect a connection with the IXth Corps,\r\noccupying the north of the forest, as the French could not be driven\r\nfrom the intervening ground. On the right, various detachments took\r\npossession of the quarries and gravel-pits near St.-Hubert.\r\n\r\nThe artillery meanwhile had got the better of the French guns; several\r\nof their batteries were silenced, others prevented from getting into\r\nposition. The French fire was in part directed on the farm of\r\nSt.-Hubert, on which the 30th Brigade were gradually encroaching. This\r\nwell-defended structure was stormed at three o'clock, close under the\r\nface of the enemy's main position, and in spite of a tremendous fire.\r\nThe 31st Brigade had also got across the valley, but an attempt to\r\nreach the farms of Moscow and Leipzig, over the open plain enclosed by\r\nthe enemy on three sides, proved a failure and resulted in great loss.\r\nThe 26th Brigade had taken possession of Jussy, on the extreme right,\r\nthus maintaining the connection with Metz, but found it impossible to\r\ncross the deep valley of Rozerieulles.\r\n\r\nThe advanced detachments of the French had been repulsed on all sides,\r\nthe farms in their front were burning, their artillery appeared to be\r\nsilenced, and, viewing the situation from Gravelotte, there remained\r\nnothing but pursuit. General von Steinmetz, therefore, at four\r\no'clock, ordered fresh forces to the front for a renewed attack.\r\n\r\nWhile the VIIth Corps occupied the border of the wood, four batteries,\r\nbacked by the 1st Cavalry Division, made their way through the narrow\r\nravine extending for about 1,500 paces east of Gravelotte. But as soon\r\nas the advanced guard of the long column came in sight, the French\r\nredoubled their rifle and artillery fire, which had till now been kept\r\nunder. One battery had soon lost the men serving four of its guns, and\r\nwas hardly able to return into the wood; a second never even got into\r\nposition. The batteries under Hesse and Gnügge, on the other hand,\r\nheld their own at St.-Hubert in spite of the loss of seventy-five\r\nhorses and of the firing from the quarries in their rear.\r\n\r\nThe foremost regiment of cavalry wheeled to the right after leaving\r\nthe hollow way, and galloped toward Point-du-Jour, but the enemy,\r\nbeing completely under cover, offered no opportunity for an attack.\r\nEvidently this was no field for utilizing the cavalry, so the\r\nregiments retired through the Mance valley under a heavy fire from all\r\nsides.\r\n\r\nThis ill-success of the Germans encouraged the French to advance from\r\nPoint-du-Jour with swarms of tirailleurs, who succeeded in driving the\r\nPrussians back from the open ground as far as the skirts of the wood.\r\nThe bullets of the Chassepots even reached the hill where the\r\nCommander-in-Chief was watching the battle, and Prince Adalbert's\r\nhorse was shot under him.\r\n\r\nFresh forces were now at hand and drove the enemy back to his main\r\nposition. St.-Hubert had remained in the hands of the Germans; and\r\nthough the survivors there were only sufficient to serve one gun,\r\nstill every attempt to cross the exposed plateau proved a failure.\r\nThus hostilities ceased at this point also, at about five o'clock in\r\nthe afternoon, allowing the weary troops on both sides to take breath\r\nand reorganize.\r\n\r\nKing William and his staff rode over to the hill on the south of\r\nMalmaison at about the same hour, but could see nothing of the\r\nsituation of the left wing, which was more than a mile away. The\r\nFrench artillery had ceased firing along the centre, from La Folie to\r\nPoint-du-Jour; but to the northward the thunder of artillery was\r\nlouder than ever. It was six o'clock, the day was nearly at an end,\r\nand decided action must at once be taken. The King therefore ordered\r\nthe First Army to advance once more, and for that purpose placed the\r\nIId Corps, just arrived after a long march, under the command of\r\nGeneral von Steinmetz.\r\n\r\nThose battalions of VII Corps which could still do good service,\r\nexcept five, which were kept in reserve, were again sent up the Mance\r\nvalley, and the battalions from the Bois de Vaux came to their support\r\ntoward Point-du-Jour and the quarries. The IId Corps of the French\r\nArmy thus attacked was now reinforced by Guard Voltigeur Division. All\r\nthe reserves were brought to the front. The artillery was more rapidly\r\nserved, and a destructive musketry fire was directed on the advancing\r\nenemy. Then the French on their side made an attack. A strong body of\r\nriflemen dispersed the smaller parties which were lying in the open,\r\ndestitute of commanders, and drove them back to the wood. There,\r\nhowever, their advance was checked, and there was still another Army\r\nCorps ready for action.\r\n\r\nThe IId Corps, the last to come up by rail to the seat of war, had up\r\nto this time followed in the wake of the army by forced marches, but\r\nhad not yet fought in any engagement. It had started from\r\nPoint-à-Mousson at 2 p.m. and, taking the road by Buxières and\r\nRezonville, arrived south of Gravelotte in the evening. The\r\nPomeranians were eager to get at the enemy without delay.\r\n\r\nIt would have been better if the Chief of the Staff, who was\r\npersonally on the field at the time, had not allowed this movement at\r\nso late an hour. A body of troops, still completely intact, might have\r\nbeen of great value the next day; it was not likely this evening to\r\naffect the issue.\r\n\r\nRushing out of Gravelotte, the foremost battalions of the IId Corps\r\npushed forward to the quarries, and up to within a few hundred paces\r\nof Point-du-Jour; but those following were soon entangled in the\r\nturmoil of the troops under fire south of St.-Hubert, and any further\r\nadvance toward Moscow was arrested. Darkness was falling, and friend\r\nbecame indistinguishable from foe. So the firing was stopped; but not\r\nuntil ten o'clock did it entirely cease.\r\n\r\nThe advance of the IId Corps resulted in some good, however, for these\r\nfresh troops could occupy the fighting-line for the night, while the\r\nmixed companies of the VIIth and VIIIth Corps were enabled to re-form\r\nin their rear.\r\n\r\nThe whole course of the engagement had conclusively proved that the\r\nposition of the French left wing, made almost impregnable by nature\r\nand art, could not be shaken even by the most devoted bravery and the\r\ngreatest sacrifices. Both parties were now facing each other in\r\nthreatening proximity, and both fully able to reopen battle next\r\nmorning. The success of the day must depend on events at the other end\r\nof the French line.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wurtemburg, standing at Ail, believed that the hour had\r\ncome for an attack on the French right at about a quarter-past five;\r\nbut that wing extended much further north than the line of his Guards,\r\nfurther, indeed, than the French Commander-in-Chief himself was aware\r\nof. Though the Saxons had participated in the capture of\r\nSte.-Marie-aux-Chênes, the Crown Prince deemed it necessary to\r\nassemble his Corps at the Bois d'Auboue, to attack the enemy in flank.\r\nOne of the brigades had to come from Jarny, and one from Ste.-Marie;\r\nso, as the Corps was late in getting away from Mars-la-Tour, it was\r\nnot expected to be on the field for some hours yet.\r\n\r\nThe 4th Brigade of Foot Guards, in obedience to orders, proceeded in\r\nthe direction of Jerusalem, immediately south of St.-Privat. As soon\r\nas General von Manstein, in command of the IXth Corps, observed this,\r\nhe ordered the 3d Brigade of Guards, which had been placed at his\r\norders, to advance from Habonville toward Amanvillers.\r\n\r\nBetween these two brigades marched the Hessians, but it was not till\r\nhalf an hour later that the First Division of Guards joined from\r\nSte.-Marie, marching on St.-Privat, on the left of the Second. This\r\nattack was directed against the broad front of the French IVth and\r\nVIth Corps. Their fortified positions at St.-Privat and Amanvillers\r\nhad as yet hardly felt the fire of the German batteries, which had\r\nfound sufficient employment in replying to the enemy's artillery\r\noutside the villages.\r\n\r\nSeveral ranks of riflemen, one above the other, were placed in front\r\nof the French main position, on the hedges and fences in a slope up\r\nthe ridge. At their back towered St.-Privat, castle-like, with its\r\nmassive buildings, which were crowded by soldiers to the very roof.\r\nThe open plain in front was thus exposed to an overwhelming shower of\r\nprojectiles.\r\n\r\nThe losses of the attacking Guards were, in fact, enormous. In the\r\ncourse of half an hour five battalions lost all, the others the\r\ngreater part of their officers, especially those of the higher grades.\r\nThousands of dead and wounded marked the track of the troops, who, in\r\nspite of their losses, pressed forward. The ranks, as fast as they\r\nwere thinned, closed up again, and their compact formation was not\r\nbroken even under the leadership of young lieutenants and ensigns. As\r\nthey got nearer to the enemy the needle-gun did good service. The\r\nFrench were driven from all their foremost positions, where, for the\r\nmost part, they did not await the final struggle. By a quarter-past\r\nsix the battalions had advanced to within 600 to 800 paces of\r\nAmanvillers and St.-Privat. The troops, weary from long combat, halted\r\nunder the steeper slopes offering some, though small, protection, and\r\nin the trenches just abandoned by the enemy. Only four battalions now\r\nremained in reserve at Ste.-Marie, behind the German line, which now\r\nextended to a length of 4,000 paces. Every charge of the French\r\ncavalry and of Cissy's Division had been persistently repelled with\r\nthe aid of twelve batteries of the Guards which had now put in an\r\nappearance; but the German troops, reduced, as they were, by untold\r\nlosses, had to face two French Corps for thirty minutes longer before\r\nreinforcements came to their aid.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly seven o'clock when, to the left of the Guards, two\r\nbrigades of the Saxon infantry arrived on the field; the other two\r\nwere still assembling in the forest of Auboue; their artillery,\r\nhowever, had for some time kept up a lively fire on Roncourt.\r\n\r\nWhen Bazaine, at three o'clock, received word that the Germans were\r\nextending the line to enclose his right wing, he ordered Picard's\r\nDivision of the Grenadier Guards, posted at Plappeville, to advance to\r\nthe scene of action. Though the distance was no more than a mile\r\nthrough the wooded valley on the right of the highway, his\r\nall-important reinforcement had not yet arrived at seven o'clock, and\r\nMarshal Canrobert, who was hardly able, by the most strenuous efforts,\r\nto check the advance of the Prussians, decided to rally his troops\r\ncloser to the fortified town of St.-Privat. The retreat from Roncourt\r\nwas to be covered by a small rearguard, as the border of the Bois de\r\nJaumont was to be held.\r\n\r\nThus it happened that the Saxons found less resistance at Roncourt\r\nthan they expected, and entered the town after a short struggle,\r\ntogether with the companies of the extreme left of the Guards; part of\r\nthem had previously been diverted from the road to Roncourt to assist\r\nthe Guards, and marched direct on St.-Privat. There terrible havoc was\r\nworked by the twenty-four batteries of the two German Corps. Many\r\nhouses were in flames, or falling in ruins under the shower of shell.\r\nBut the French were determined to defend this point, where the fate of\r\nthe day was to be decided, to the last. The batteries belonging to\r\ntheir right wing were placed between St.-Privat and the Bois de\r\nJaumont, that is, on the flank of the advancing Saxons. Others faced\r\nthe Prussians from the south, and as the German columns came on side\r\nby side they were received by a shower of bullets from the French\r\nrifles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CAPITULATION OF SEDAN ANTON VON WERNER]\r\n\r\nAll these obstacles were defied in the onward rush, though again under\r\nheavy losses, some stopping here and there to fire a volley, others\r\nagain never firing a shot. By sundown they stood within 300 paces of\r\nSt.-Privat. Some detachments of the Xth Corps, who were on the road to\r\nSt.-Ail, now joined them, and the final onset was made from every side\r\nat once. The French still defended the burning houses and the church\r\nwith great obstinacy, till, finding themselves completely surrounded,\r\nthey surrendered at about eight o'clock. More than 2,000 men were\r\ntaken prisoners, and the wounded were rescued from the burning houses.\r\n\r\nThe defeated remnant of the IVth French Corps retired towards the\r\nvalley of the Moselle, their retreat being covered by the brigade\r\noccupying the Bois de Jaumont and by the cavalry.\r\n\r\nOnly at that period did the Grenadier Guards put in an appearance,\r\ndrawing up the artillery reserves east of Amanvillers. The German\r\nbatteries at once took up the fight, which lasted till late in the\r\nnight, and Amanvillers also was left burning.\r\n\r\nHere the retirement of the IVth French Corps had already commenced,\r\nscreened by repeated severe onslaughts; the right wing of the Guards\r\nand the left of the IXth Corps had a lively hand-to-hand encounter\r\nwith the enemy. Still the town remained in the hands of the French for\r\nthe night. Their IIId Corps maintained their position at Moscow until\r\nthree o'clock, and the IId until five o'clock in the morning, though\r\nengaged in constant frays with the outposts of the Pomeranian\r\nDivision, who eventually took possession of the plateaus of Moscow and\r\nPoint-du-Jour.\r\n\r\nThis success of the 18th of August had only been made possible by the\r\npreceding battles of the 14th and 16th.\r\n\r\nThe French estimate their losses at 13,000 men. In October, 173,000\r\nwere still in Metz, which proves that more than 180,000 French engaged\r\nin the battle of the 18th. The seven German Corps facing them were\r\nexactly 178,818 strong. Thus the French had been driven out of a\r\nposition of almost unrivalled natural advantages by a numerically\r\ninferior force. It is self-evident that the loss of the aggressors\r\nmust have been much greater than that of the defence; it amounted to\r\n20,584 men, among them 899 officers.\r\n\r\nThough the war-establishment provides one officer to every forty men,\r\nin this battle one officer had been killed to every twenty-three; a\r\nsplendid testimony to the example set by the officers to their brave\r\nmen, but a loss which could not be made good during the course of the\r\nwar. During the first fortnight of August, in six battles the Germans\r\nhad lost 50,000 men. It was impossible at once to find substitutes,\r\nbut new companies were formed of time-expired soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to be done that same evening was to move on the\r\nforemost baggage train, and the ambulance corps from the right bank of\r\nthe Moselle; ammunition was also served out all round. In Rezonville,\r\nwhich was crowded with the wounded, a little garret for the King and\r\nquarters for the Staff had with much difficulty been secured. The\r\nofficers were engaged throughout the night in studying the\r\nrequirements which the new situation created by the victory\r\nperemptorily demanded. All these orders were placed before His Majesty\r\nfor approval by the morning of the 19th.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: From _The Franco-German War of 1870-71_.

So lofty is this aim\r\nthat it alone entitles these confessions to a serious and respectful\r\nconsideration. But how much must our admiration and our sense of the\r\nvalue of this work be increased when we perceive with what earnestness\r\nof effort, and with what depth of feeling, the Fieldmarshal had\r\nrevolved these thoughts in his mind till he brought them to maturity.\r\nAnd more than that. It was his wish to bequeath these consolatory\r\nthoughts to his family, as a sincere confession of his private\r\nconvictions. This is the light in which he wished posterity to regard\r\nthis manuscript, which he wrote out in the last year of his life, in\r\nwonderfully firm characters, which attest the worth of the matter\r\ncontained in it.\r\n\r\nHe wrote down these thoughts at Creisau, and left the copy on his\r\ndesk. Whenever he visited his country-seat he revised and corrected\r\nwhat he had written. No less than four drafts of the introduction to\r\nthis work have been preserved.\r\n\r\nThe succession of thoughts is the same in all four versions, but on\r\nthe one hand renewed and deepened meditations enabled him to express\r\nhis ideas with greater force and precision, and on the other sometimes\r\ndeveloped them further, so as to present them more exhaustively and\r\nconvincingly.\r\n\r\nThese pages contain the last efforts of a noble life. In them Moltke\r\nappears as he was when we knew him and took him for our pattern,\r\nreconciled with the anomalies and the contradictions of life, with a\r\npious grasp of principles which he had thought out for himself, and in\r\nthe assurance of which he found peace. We learn here how it was\r\npossible for him to rise superior to the world, and preserve a\r\ncontented mind in all the vicissitudes of life.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: From _Moltke: His Life and Character_. Permission Harper\r\n& Brothers, New York and London.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. TORCHE-MITTLER.\r\n\r\n\r\nMan feels that he is a complete being, different from other creatures,\r\nand outwardly distinguished from them by his body, which here on earth\r\nis the habitation of the soul.\r\n\r\nYet in this complete whole I believe I can distinguish different\r\nfunctions, which, though closely connected with the soul, and ruled by\r\nit, have an independent existence.\r\n\r\nIn the mysterious beginnings of life physical development takes the\r\nfirst place. Nature is busily at work in the child's body as it grows,\r\nand is already preparing it to be the dwelling-place of higher\r\nfunctions. The body reaches the acme of its perfection before its\r\ncareer is half over, and out of the surplus of its energy calls new\r\nlife into being. Thenceforward its lot is decay and painful struggling\r\nto preserve its own existence.\r\n\r\nDuring something like a third of our existence, that is, while we are\r\nasleep, the body receives no commands from its ruler, and yet the\r\nheart beats without interruption, the tissues are wasted and repaired,\r\nand the process of respiration is continued, all independently of our\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nThe servant may even rebel against the master, as when our muscles are\r\npainfully contracted by cramp. But pain is the summons for help which\r\nis sent by the living organism when it has lost control over the dead\r\nmatter, which loss we feel as the illness of our vassal.\r\n\r\nOn the whole we must regard our body as a real part of our being,\r\nwhich is still, in a sense, external to our inmost selves.\r\n\r\nIs, then, the soul at least the true ego, a single and indivisible\r\nwhole?\r\n\r\nThe intellect advances, by slow development, to greater and greater\r\nperfection till old age is reached, if the body does not leave it in\r\nthe lurch. The critical faculty grows as experience accumulates, but\r\nmemory, reason's handmaid, disappears at an earlier stage, or at least\r\nloses the power of receiving new impressions. Wonderful enough is this\r\nfaculty which enables us to store up all the valuable lessons and\r\nexperiences of earliest youth in a thousand drawers, which open in a\r\nmoment in answer to the requirements of the mind.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be disputed that the old often appear dull-witted, but I\r\ncannot believe in a real darkening of the reason, which is a bright\r\nspark of the Divine, and even in madness the negation of reason is\r\nonly external and apparent. A deaf man playing on an instrument out of\r\ntune may strike the right notes, and be inwardly persuaded that his\r\nexecution is faultless, while all around him hear nothing but the\r\nwildest discords.\r\n\r\nThe sovereignty of reason is absolute; she recognizes no superior\r\nauthority. No power, not even that of our own wills, can compel her to\r\nregard as false what she has already recognized as true.\r\n\r\n_E pur si muove_!\r\n\r\nThought ranges through the infinite realms of starry space, and\r\nfathoms the inscrutable depths of the minutest life, finding nowhere\r\nany _limit_, but everywhere _law_, which is the immediate expression\r\nof the divine thought.\r\n\r\nThe stone falls on Sirius by the same law of gravitation as on the\r\nearth; the distances of the planets, the combinations of chemical\r\nelements are based on arithmetical ratios, and everywhere the same\r\ncauses produce the same effects. Nowhere in nature is there anything\r\narbitrary, but everywhere law. True, reason cannot comprehend the\r\norigin of things, but neither is she anywhere in conflict with the\r\nlaws that govern all things. Reason and the universe are in harmony;\r\nthey must therefore have the same origin.\r\n\r\nEven when, through the imperfection of all created things, reason\r\nenters on paths which lead to error, truth is still the one object of\r\nher search.\r\n\r\nReason may thus be brought into conflict with many an honored\r\ntradition. She rejects miracle, \"faith's dearest child,\" and refuses\r\nto admit that Omnipotence can ever find it necessary for the\r\nattainment of its purposes to suspend, in isolated cases, the\r\noperation of those laws by which the universe is eternally governed.\r\nBut these doubts are not directed against religion, but against the\r\nform in which religion is presented to us.\r\n\r\nChristianity has raised the world from barbarism to civilization. Its\r\ninfluence has, in the course of centuries, abolished slavery, ennobled\r\nwork, emancipated women, and revealed eternity. But was it dogma that\r\nbrought these blessings? It is possible to avoid misunderstandings\r\nwith regard to all subjects except those which transcend human\r\nconception, and these are the very subjects over which men have fought\r\nand desolated the world for the last eighteen hundred years, from the\r\nextermination of the Arians, on through the Thirty Years' War, to the\r\nscaffold of the Inquisition, and what is the result of all this\r\nfighting? The same differences of opinion as ever.\r\n\r\nWe may accept the doctrines of religion, as we accept the assurance of\r\na trusty friend, without examination, but the kernel of all religions\r\nis the morality they teach, of which the Christian is the purest and\r\nmost far-reaching.\r\n\r\nAnd yet men speak slightingly of a barren morality, and place the form\r\nin which religion is presented before everything else. I fear it is\r\nthe pulpit zealot, who tries to persuade where he cannot convince,\r\nthat empties the church with his sermons.\r\n\r\nAfter all, why should not every pious prayer, whether addressed to\r\nBuddha, to Allah, or to Jehovah, be heard by the same God, beside whom\r\nthere is none other? Does not the mother hear her child's petition in\r\nwhatever language it lisps her name?\r\n\r\nReason is nowhere in conflict with morality, for the good is always\r\nfinally identical with the rational; but whether our actions shall or\r\nshall not correspond with the good, reason cannot decide. Here the\r\nruling part of the soul is supreme, the soul which feels, acts, and\r\nwills. To her alone, not to her two vassals, has God entrusted the\r\ntwo-edged sword of freewill, that gift which, as Scripture tells us,\r\nmay be our salvation or our perdition.\r\n\r\nBut, more than this, a trusty councillor has been assigned us, who is\r\nindependent of our wills, and bears credentials from God Himself.\r\nConscience is an incorruptible and infallible judge, whom, if we will,\r\nwe may hear pronounce sentence every moment, and whose voice at last\r\nreaches even those who most obstinately refuse to listen.\r\n\r\nThe laws which human society has imposed upon itself can take account\r\nof actions only in their tribunals, and not of thoughts and feelings.\r\nEven the various religions make different demands among the different\r\npeoples. Here they require the Sunday to be kept holy, here the\r\nSaturday or Friday. One allows pleasures which another forbids. Even\r\napart from these differences there is always a wide neutral ground\r\nbetween what is allowed and what is forbidden; and it is here that\r\nconscience, with her subtler discrimination, raises her voice. She\r\ntells us that _every_ day should be kept sacred to the Lord, that even\r\npermitted interest becomes unjust when exacted from the needy; in a\r\nword, she preaches morality in the bosom of Christian and Jew, of\r\nheathen and savage. For even among uncivilized races which have not\r\nthe light of Christianity there is an agreement as to the fundamental\r\nconceptions of good and evil. They, too, recognize the breaking of\r\npromises, lying, treachery, and ingratitude as evil; they, too, hold\r\nas sacred the bond between parents, children, and kinsmen. It is\r\nhard to believe in the universal corruption of mankind, for, however\r\nobscured by savagery and superstition, there lies dormant in every\r\nhuman breast that feeling for the noble and the beautiful which is the\r\nseed of virtue, and a conscience which points out the right path. Can\r\nthere be a more convincing proof of God's existence than this\r\nuniversal sense of right and wrong, this unanimous recognition of one\r\nlaw, alike in the physical and in the moral world, except that nature\r\nobeys this law with a full and absolute obedience, while man, who is\r\nfree, has the power of violating it?\r\n\r\nThe body and the reason serve the ruling part of the soul, but they\r\nput forward claims of their own, they have their own share of power,\r\nand thus man's life is a perpetual conflict with self. If in this\r\nconflict the soul, hard-pressed from within and without, does not\r\nalways end by obeying the voice of conscience, let us hope that He who\r\ncreated us imperfect will not require perfection from us.\r\n\r\nFor consider to what violent storms man is exposed in the voyage of\r\nlife, what variety there is in his natural endowments, what\r\nincongruity between education and position in life. It is easy for the\r\nfavorite of fortune to keep in the right path; temptation, at any rate\r\nto crime, hardly reaches him; how hard, on the other hand, is it for\r\nthe hungry, the uneducated, the passionate man to refrain from evil.\r\nTo all this due weight will be given in the last judgment, when guilt\r\nand innocence are put in the balance, and thus mercy will become\r\njustice, two conceptions which generally exclude one another.\r\n\r\nIt is harder to think of nothing than of something; when the something\r\nis once given, harder to imagine cessation than continuance. This\r\nearthly life cannot possibly be an end in itself. We did not ask for\r\nit; it was given to us, imposed upon us. We must be destined to\r\nsomething higher than a perpetual repetition of the sad experiences of\r\nthis life. Shall those enigmas which surround us on all sides, and for\r\na solution of which the best of mankind have sought their whole life\r\nlong, never be made plain? What purpose is served by the thousand ties\r\nof love and friendship which bind past and present together, if there\r\nis no future, if death ends all?\r\n\r\nBut what can we take with us into the future?\r\n\r\nThe functions of our earthly garment, the body, have ceased; the\r\nmatter composing it, which even during life was ever being changed,\r\nhas entered into new chemical combinations, and the earth enters into\r\npossession of all that is her due. Not an atom is lost. Scripture\r\npromises us the resurrection of a glorified body, and indeed a\r\nseparate existence without limitation in space is unthinkable; yet it\r\nmay be that this promise implies nothing more than the continued\r\nexistence of the individual, as opposed to pantheism.\r\n\r\nWe may be allowed to hope that our reason, and with it all the\r\nknowledge that we have painfully acquired, will pass with us into\r\neternity; perhaps, too, the remembrance of our earthly life. Whether\r\nthat is really to be wished is another question. How if our whole life\r\nall our thoughts and actions should some day be spread out before us\r\nand we became our own judges, incorruptible and pitiless?\r\n\r\nBut, above all, the emotions must be retained by the soul, if it is to\r\nbe immortal. Friendship does indeed rest on reciprocity, and is partly\r\nan affair of the reason; but love can exist though unreturned. Love is\r\nthe purest, the most divine spark of our being.\r\n\r\nScripture bids us before all things love God, an invisible,\r\nincomprehensible Being, who sends us joy and happiness, but also\r\nprivation and pain. How else can we love Him than by obeying His\r\ncommandments, and loving our fellow-men, whom we see and understand?\r\n\r\nWhen, as the Apostle Paul writes, faith is lost in knowledge, and hope\r\nin sight, and only love remains, then we hope, not without reason, to\r\nbe assured of the love of our merciful Judge.

HOLCOMBE, Ph.D.\r\n\r\nAssistant Professor of Government, Harvard University\r\n\r\n\r\nFerdinand Lassalle was born on April 11, 1825, at Breslau, of Jewish\r\nparents. The father, Hyman Lassal, was a prosperous business man,\r\nambitious for his son, able to give him the best education the times\r\nafforded, and willing to let him choose his own career. The life of\r\nthe Lassal family seems to have been like that of any well-to-do\r\nJewish family in the kingdom of Prussia during the early nineteenth\r\ncentury. Of a quiet and peaceable behavior, they were devoted mainly\r\nto money-making and their domestic affairs.\r\n\r\nThe young Lassalle gave early indications of his unusual character.\r\nWhile still a boy in the local grammar school, his proud and\r\nindependent disposition won him the displeasure of his teachers.\r\nEspecially the oppression of his own race filled his soul with wrath.\r\n\"O could I only give myself up to my boyish day-dreams,\" he wrote in\r\nhis note-book at this time, \"how I would put myself at the head of the\r\nJews, weapons in hand, and make them independent!\" Eventually he\r\nabandoned in disgust the attempt to gain a classical education in the\r\nschools of his native city and entered the commercial high school in\r\nLeipzig. Here again his fiery temperament could not brook the\r\nrestraints imposed upon him and he presently returned to his father's\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nThe problem of a career was not easy to solve. The father's success\r\nenabled the son to choose his course in life without regard to\r\nfinancial considerations. Business and mere money-making were in fact\r\ndistasteful to him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FERDINAND LASSALLE]\r\n\r\nThe learned professions were more to his liking. The father\r\nrecommended medicine or the law, but the son aspired to some less\r\nhackneyed career. Jews were not then admitted to the service of the\r\nstate in Prussia and the absence of popular institutions of government\r\nrendered an independent political career for the time being out of the\r\nquestion. The son chose, therefore, to make his mark as a man of\r\nlearning. He would be a great philosopher or scientist. Doubtless he\r\nkept in mind the possibility of engaging in journalism, should the\r\ntimes change, and becoming a tribune of the people. Such bold ideas\r\nare the birthright of all boys of spirit.\r\n\r\nFerdinand Lassale finished his education with his destiny consciously\r\nbefore him. He studied philology and philosophy at the universities of\r\nBreslau and Berlin and in the winter of 1845-46 made his first visit\r\nto Paris as a traveling scholar. Here he first adorned his family name\r\nwith the final _le_, and here, also, he met the chief of the heroes of\r\nhis youth, Heinrich Heine. Heine has given us a vivid pen-picture of\r\nLassalle, as he saw him in those student days. \"My friend, Mr.\r\nLassalle ... is a most highly gifted young man, uniting the widest\r\nknowledge with the greatest astuteness. I have been astounded at his\r\nenergy of will, vigor of intellect, and promptness of action....\r\nLassalle is a true child of modern times, wishing to know nothing of\r\nthe humility and renunciation which have characterized our own lives.\r\nThis new race means to enjoy, to assert itself.... We were, however,\r\nperhaps happier in our idealism than these stern gladiators who go\r\nforth so proudly to mortal combats.\"\r\n\r\nReturning to Berlin in the spring of 1846, Lassalle signalized the\r\nattainment of his majority by espousing the cause of the Countess von\r\nHatzfeld, then in the midst of her suits for divorce and for an\r\naccounting of her property. It was a characteristic act. The Countess'\r\ntroubles arose through no fault of his. He had little to gain by\r\nengaging in the affair and much to lose--not only time and money,\r\nbut friends, reputation, and his very career. Yet he plunged into the\r\nthick of the fray and made the cause of the unhappy lady his own. For\r\neight long years he fought her enemies from law-court to law-court,\r\nthrough thirty-six of them in all, to final victory. From it all he\r\ngained a good working knowledge of the law, a splendid training in\r\nforensic address, and a taste of the joys of combat against bitter\r\nodds. These things were later to stand him in good stead. But he had\r\ntouched smut and was himself besmirched.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the famous year, 1848, had come and gone. Men like Lassalle\r\nare made for just such years. His friends all played their parts, each\r\nin his own way, in the struggle for German liberty and union. Lassalle\r\nalone was absent from the field. He was defending himself against a\r\ncharge of criminal conspiracy to commit larceny, an incident in the\r\ncase of the Countess von Hatzfeld. He disposed of this charge in\r\nseason to join the editors of the _Neue Rheinische Zeitung_, and in\r\nthe spring of 1849 he completed his apprenticeship as a revolutionist\r\nwith a term in jail. At the expiration of his sentence he returned to\r\nthe cause of the Countess, but he was required by the Prussian\r\ngovernment to keep away from Berlin. Not until 1857, through the\r\nintervention of A. von Humboldt, did he receive permission to resume\r\nhis residence in the capital. Then, with his friend, the Countess, he\r\nsettled down once more to the realization of his youthful dreams, and\r\nthe long-deferred career was taken up in earnest.\r\n\r\nLassalle's career as a scholar and man of learning was short, but\r\nproductive. It was opened in 1857 with the publication of his work,\r\nthe _Philosophy of Heraclitus,_ projected more than ten years before,\r\nand it was concluded in 1861, as the event proved, by the publication\r\nof his _System of the Acquired Rights_. Midway between the two\r\nappeared a dramatic composition, _Franz von Sickingen,_ which served\r\nboth as an intellectual diversion from the more serious studies in\r\nphilosophy and law and as a personal confession of faith on the part\r\nof the author. None of these works can be pronounced an unqualified\r\nsuccess. The philosophy of Heraclitus was too obscure to exert any\r\ngreat influence upon contemporary thought, even when expounded by a\r\nLassalle, and the philosophy of Lassalle himself was too closely\r\nmodeled upon that of his master, Hegel, to obtain much notice on its\r\nown account. The treatise on the acquired rights of man was too\r\ntechnical to attract popular attention and too unorthodox to receive\r\nthe general approval of professional students of the law. The _Franz\r\nvon Sickingen_ was too deficient in dramatic action to be presented on\r\nthe stage and too artificial in literary form to be read in the\r\nlibrary. The three productions secured for Lassalle a position among\r\nscholars but brought him no general recognition.\r\n\r\nThe three productions, however, pour a flood of light upon\r\nLassalle's own powerful personality. In the _Philosophy of\r\nHeraclitus_ he grappled with the most formidable philosophical\r\nproblems and showed himself a master of the Hegelian dialectic.\r\nIn the _System of the Acquired Rights_ he attacked the very foundations\r\nof the current theories of law and justice with the same concentration\r\nof energy and purpose as had been displayed in the more practical\r\nproblems of law and justice involved in the case of the Countess\r\nvon Hatzfeld. But it is in _Franz von Sickingen_ that Lassalle\r\nexpressed his own nature most clearly and most completely.\r\nHere indeed he speaks directly for himself through the lips of\r\nUlrich von Hutten. Passage after passage springs from the soul of\r\nthe living Lassalle, the same Lassalle that in his boyhood dreams\r\nwould emancipate the Jews by force of arms, that in his early manhood\r\nso deeply impressed Heine, and that so shortly afterwards\r\nwas ready to defy all the powers of the kingdom in defence\r\nof a friendless woman. The following speech of the legendary\r\nvon Hutten is characteristic of the real Lassalle:\r\n\r\n  \"O worthy Sir! Think better of the sword!\r\n  A sword, when swung in freedom's sacred cause,\r\n  Becomes the Holy Word, of which you preach,\r\n  The God, incarnate in reality.\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n  And all great things, which e'er will come to pass\r\n  Will owe their final being to the sword.\"\r\n\r\nIn short, Lassalle was not by nature a man of the study. He was a man\r\nof the battlefield.\r\n\r\nThe hour for battle was fast approaching. In 1859 the alliance of\r\nNapoleon the Third and Cavour against the Austrians was consummated\r\nand the war for the liberation and unification of Italy began. The\r\nhopes of all true Germans for the unification of the Fatherland took\r\nnew life. Especially the survivors of '48 felt their pulses quicken.\r\nIn 1859 Lassalle revealed his own interest in contemporary politics by\r\nthe publication of his pamphlet on _The Italian War and the Duty of\r\nPrussia_, and in the following year by his address on _Fichte's\r\nPolitical Legacy and Our Own Times_. He also planned to establish a\r\npopular newspaper in Berlin, but the scheme was abandoned in 1861, on\r\naccount of the refusal of the Prussian government to sanction the\r\nnaturalization of the man whom Lassalle desired for his associate in\r\nthe enterprise, Karl Marx. With the Prince of Prussia's accession to\r\nthe throne and the brilliant successes of the Progressive party in the\r\nPrussian elections, men instinctively felt that the times were big\r\nwith portentous events.\r\n\r\nLassalle's political ideas were already well developed. He was born a\r\ndemocrat. In early nineteenth-century England the young Disraeli could\r\nhopefully plan a different course, but Lassalle in Prussia could look\r\nfor no public career as an aristocrat. Under the circumstances to be a\r\ndemocrat meant also to be a republican, and, if need be, a\r\nrevolutionist. As a youth he drank deep from the idealistic springs\r\nthat inspired the republican party throughout Germany. He admired\r\nSchiller and Fichte and, above all, Heine and Börne. Lassalle indeed\r\nhad drunk deeper than most of the revolutionists of '48. He was not\r\nonly a democrat and a republican; he was also a socialist. Even before\r\nhis first visit to Paris he had become acquainted with the writings of\r\nSt. Simon, Fourier, and the utopian socialists in general. His mind\r\nwas ripe for the doctrines of the _Communist Manifesto_, when that\r\nepoch-making document appeared, but he does not seem to have become\r\npersonally acquainted with Marx until his connection with the _Neue\r\nRheinische Zeitung_ in the fall of 1848. From that time on till the\r\nfoundation of the _Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein_ Lassalle\r\nstood closer to Marx than to any other one man.\r\n\r\nLassalle's opportunity to turn definitely from scholarship to politics\r\ncame in 1862 with the outbreak of the struggle over the Prussian\r\nconstitution. In a series of vigorous addresses (April, 1862, to\r\nFebruary, 1863) he first criticised, then condemned, the Progressive\r\nparty for its--as it seemed to him--pusillanimous policy. But Lassalle\r\nwas not content merely to criticise and condemn. His restless energy\r\nfound no adequate expression short of the creation of a new party of\r\nhis own. His repudiation of the Progressives, however, was not\r\ndictated by differences over tactics alone. He rejected the\r\nfundamental principles of the liberal movement in German politics. He\r\nsaw around him the evidences of deep and widespread poverty. The great\r\nproblem of the day to his mind was not the political problem of a\r\nproper constitution of government, but the social problem of a proper\r\ndistribution of wealth. The need, as he saw it, was not for\r\nparchment-guarantees of individual liberty. It was for practical\r\npromotion of social welfare. Hence, at the same time that he opened\r\nfire upon the tactics of the Progressives, he unfolded his plans for\r\nthe constructive treatment of the social, as distinct from the\r\npolitical, problem.\r\n\r\nThe nature of Lassalle's social ideal and the character of the means\r\nby which he sought to justify it are for the first time\r\nsystematically set forth in his address (April 12, 1862) \"upon the\r\nspecial connection between modern times and the idea of a laboring\r\nclass,\" subsequently published under the title, _The Workingmen's\r\nProgramme_. This address was the point of departure for the socialist\r\nmovement in Germany, as the _Communist Manifesto_ of Marx and Engels\r\nwas that of international socialism. It was indeed largely inspired by\r\nthe spirit of that revolutionary document. During the two and a half\r\nyears which followed the publication of this address, Lassalle often\r\nset forth his fundamental social philosophy with extraordinary\r\nclearness and force, but he never surpassed his opening salutation to\r\nthe workingmen of Germany. It has been read by hundreds of thousands.\r\nIt was his masterpiece.\r\n\r\n_The Workingmen's Programme_ attracted the immediate attention of the\r\nPrussian government. The police took offence at the tone of the\r\naddress and brought against its author a charge of criminal incitement\r\nof the poor to hatred and contempt of the rich. On January 16, 1863,\r\nLassalle appeared in court and defended himself against this charge in\r\nan almost equally celebrated address, published under the title,\r\n_Science and the Workingmen_. Here Lassalle speaks in a different but\r\nno less brilliant vein. From that time forth Lassalle's appearances\r\nbefore audiences of workingmen quite generally led to corresponding\r\nappearances before audiences of judges. If one court set him free, he\r\nwas liable to be haled before another court for defamation of the\r\nprosecuting attorney in the court of first resort. But the prisoner's\r\ndock served as well as the orator's platform for the purposes of his\r\nagitation.\r\n\r\n_The Workingmen's Programme_ attracted less immediate attention from\r\nthe workingmen themselves. But among the few whose attention was\r\nattracted was a group of Leipzig labor leaders who invited Lassalle to\r\nadvise them more fully concerning his plans for the formation of an\r\nindependent labor party. Lassalle's reply to this invitation was the\r\n_Open Letter to the Committee for the Calling_ _of a General\r\nConvention of German Workingmen at Leipzig_, dated March 1, 1863. This\r\nletter sets forth the platform upon which Lassalle proposed to make\r\nhis appeal for the support of the working classes. The two main planks\r\nof the platform were the demands for manhood suffrage and for the\r\nestablishment of coöperative factories and workshops with the aid of\r\nsubventions from the State. Through manhood suffrage Lassalle expected\r\nthat the working classes would immediately become the dominant power\r\nin the State, and through State-aided producers' associations he\r\nexpected that the coöperative commonwealth would eventually come into\r\nbeing. Manhood suffrage was thus the fundamental political condition\r\nof Social Democracy. State-aided producers' associations were but a\r\ntemporary economic expedient. Upon this basis, May 23, 1863, the\r\nGeneral Association of German Workingmen (_Allgemeiner Deutscher\r\nArbeiterverein_) was founded.\r\n\r\nThe immediate results of the foundation of the General Association of\r\nGerman Workingmen were much less than Lassalle had anticipated. He had\r\nhoped that it would quickly surpass the Liberal National Association,\r\nfounded by the leaders of the Progressive party in 1859, which at this\r\ntime counted about 25,000 members. In fact, during Lassalle's life the\r\nWorkingmen's Association never reached one-fifth of that number. The\r\nworkingmen generally were slow to recognize either the character of\r\nLassalle's purposes or the character of the man himself. Despite the\r\npower and brilliancy of the speech-making campaign upon which Lassalle\r\npromptly entered he made little headway. The progress of the movement\r\namong the rank and file, however, was more satisfactory than in any\r\nother quarter. Marx had been lost to the movement before it was\r\ninaugurated and the rigid Marxians among the German socialists\r\ncontinued to hold aloof. Lassalle's close personal friend, Lothar\r\nBucher, could see no prospect of early success and withdrew while\r\nthere was still time. The independent socialist, Rodbertus, to whom\r\nLassalle next turned for assistance, had little faith in manhood\r\nsuffrage and none at all in State-aided producers' associations. To\r\nconfirm his unbelief in manhood suffrage he pointed to the ease with\r\nwhich a popular plebiscite could be manipulated by a Louis Napoleon.\r\nState-aided producers' associations, he declared to be incompatible\r\nwith scientific socialism, a dangerous compromise between the national\r\nworkshops advocated by the utopian socialist, Louis Blanc, and the\r\ncoöperative corporations, advocated by the anarchist, Prudhomme. So\r\nLassalle found himself alone at the head of his new independent labor\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nIt was not the workingmen but the middle-class Progressive party that\r\nwas most aroused by Lassalle's _Open Letter._ He was regarded as a\r\ntraitor to the cause of the constitution and a practical ally of the\r\nforces of reaction--in short, as either a fool or a knave. Lassalle\r\nsaw clearly enough that he could not succeed without making clear to\r\nhis prospective followers the irreconcilability of liberalism and\r\nsocialism, and directed his most powerful efforts against the position\r\nof the Progressive party. His _Workingmen's Reader_ (May, 1863) and\r\n_Bastiat-Schulze von Delitzsch_ (January, 1864) are conspicuous\r\nmemorials of his campaign against liberalism. The liberal position was\r\nsubstantially that the workingmen, though without effective\r\nvoting-power, were honorary members of the Progressive party, and\r\nhence needed no independent party of their own, and that, for the\r\nrest, they could best promote their special economic interests by\r\n\"self-help,\" that is, through voluntary and unassisted coöperation.\r\nLiberal leaders, especially Schulze-Delitzsch, labored strenuously to\r\nimprove the well-being of the working-classes along these lines, and\r\ntheir efforts were not in vain. The Progressive watchword, \"right\r\nmakes might,\" sophistical as it seemed to Lassalle, appealed to the\r\nidealism of the German people, and the party was in the heyday of its\r\nsuccess. More and more Lassalle found himself forced by the\r\nnecessities of his struggle with the Progressives into compromising\r\nrelations with the government of Bismarck. His last great speech\r\ndelivered at Ronsdorf on the first anniversary of the foundation of\r\nthe Workingmen's Association betrays the dilemma into which he had\r\nfallen. Under the conditions of the time there was not enough room\r\nbetween the contending forces of progress and reaction for the great\r\nindependent labor party which Lassalle had hoped to create. There was\r\nroom for a humble beginning, but that was all.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to dwell on the details of Lassalle's last twelve\r\nmonths and tragic end. The story is brief: a year of exhausting toil\r\nand small result, then a short vacation, an unfortunate love-affair, a\r\nfoolish challenge to a duel, a single pistol-shot, and three days\r\nlater, August 31, 1864, the end. Thus he died, and on his tomb in\r\nBreslau was written: \"Here lies what was mortal of Ferdinand Lassalle,\r\nthe Thinker and Fighter.\"\r\n\r\nThe name of Lassalle is most frequently connected with that of Marx.\r\nCertainly the two had much in common. They worked together in 1848 and\r\nwould have done so again in 1862 if Lassalle had had his way. For\r\nfourteen years they were personal friends. Though they ultimately\r\ndrifted apart, they never became enemies. Lassalle was seven years\r\nyounger than Marx and was unquestionably strongly influenced by the\r\nideas of the founder of scientific socialism. At the same time he was\r\na man who did his own thinking, and his speeches and writings, even\r\nthose dealing most particularly with the philosophy of socialism, are\r\nby no means mere paraphrases of Marx. His ideas betray resemblances to\r\nthose of various contemporary writers on socialism and the socialist\r\nmovement, notably Lorenz von Stein, the author of the _History of the\r\nSocial Movements in France from 1789_. The economic interpretation of\r\nhistory, set forth in the _Workingmen's Programme_, however, is in\r\nmany respects but an amplification of the economic interpretation of\r\nhistory originally and more briefly set forth in the _Communist\r\nManifesto_. The theory of economics in general and of wages in\r\nparticular, contained in the _Bastiat-Schulze von Delitzsch_, is\r\nsubstantially the same as that contained in Marx's _Critique of\r\nPolitical Economy,_ published in 1859. Regarded solely as a\r\ntheoretical socialist, Lassalle is rightly classed among the Marxians.\r\n\r\nYet Lassalle's position with regard to some important theoretical\r\nquestions was distasteful to Marx. In philosophy, for example,\r\nLassalle was a pure Hegelian and never abandoned the idealistic\r\nstandpoint of his master. Marx, as is well known, was a materialistic\r\nHegelian. The differences between them in this regard were revealed\r\nmost clearly in the _System of the Acquired Rights_. Lassalle traced\r\nthe development of the German laws of inheritance from the Roman\r\nconcept of the immortality of the legal personality. Marx would have\r\nderived them from the conditions of life among the Germans themselves.\r\nIn Franz von Sickingen and his cause Lassalle thought he saw a glimpse\r\nof the revolutionary spirit of modern times. Marx saw only a belated\r\nand futile struggle on the part of a member of the decadent medieval\r\norder of petty barons against the rising order of territorial princes.\r\nHad Lassalle linked up the cause of the petty barons with the revolt\r\nof the peasants, Marx would have thought better of his performance,\r\nbut this Lassalle had neglected to do. In the _Philosophy of\r\nHeraclitus_ Marx took little interest.\r\n\r\nThe most important differences between Marx and Lassalle arose with\r\nrespect to the exigencies of practical politics. Marx, like Lassalle,\r\nwas a democrat. Lassalle, however, consistently placed the demand for\r\nmanhood suffrage in the forefront of his immediate political demands,\r\nwhilst Marx believed that manhood suffrage under the then-existing\r\nconditions on the Continent of Europe would prove more useful to those\r\nwho controlled the electoral machinery than to the workingmen\r\nthemselves. Marx, like Lassalle, believed in the republican form of\r\ngovernment. Lassalle, however, could recognize the temporary value of\r\nmonarchical institutions in the struggle against the capitalistic\r\nsystem, whilst Marx would have had the workingmen depend upon\r\nthemselves alone. Marx, like Lassalle, believed in the inevitableness\r\nof the fall of capitalism. Lassalle, however, could appreciate the\r\ndesirability of realizing some portion of the promised future in the\r\nimmediate present, whilst Marx preferred not to risk the prolongation\r\nof the life of the capitalistic system by attempting to discount the\r\nday when the wage-earning classes should come wholly into their own.\r\nMarx, like Lassalle, was a revolutionist. Lassalle, however, was\r\ninterested primarily in bringing about the social revolution on German\r\nsoil, whilst Marx was an internationalist, a veritable man without a\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe two were bound to clash as soon as Lassalle began the development\r\nof his practical political programme. Marx was not only sceptical of\r\nthe wisdom of Lassalle's campaign for manhood suffrage, but he was\r\neven strongly opposed to the campaign for the establishment of\r\nproducers' associations with the aid of subventions from the Prussian\r\nmonarchy. That programme represented all that was odious to Marx:\r\norganization of the wage-earners on purely national instead of\r\ninternational lines, conversion of private ownership of capital into\r\ncorporate instead of public ownership, establishment of a social\r\nmonarchy instead of a coöperative commonwealth. Obviously Marx could\r\nnot endorse Lassalle's proposals to make the socialist movement a\r\nfactor in contemporary German politics, nor did Lassalle endorse the\r\nMarxian policy presently embodied in the \"International.\"\r\n\r\nIn the matter of programme and tactics neither Marx nor Lassalle has\r\nbeen altogether justified by the verdict of history. In the beginning\r\nthe followers of Lassalle and the followers of Marx pursued their\r\ncommon ends by independent roads. Brought together by the logic of\r\nevents, they composed their differences, taking what seemed best to\r\nserve their purpose from the ideas of each. It is known that Marx was\r\nharshly critical of the programme adopted at Gotha in 1875. It may be\r\nguessed that Lassalle, had he lived, would not altogether have\r\napproved of the tactics pursued by those in charge of the united\r\nparty's affairs. Today, the Social Democratic party, having grown\r\nstrong and great, can recognize its obligations to both Marx and\r\nLassalle.\r\n\r\nLassalle and Marx had entirely different functions to perform in the\r\nsocialist movement. Marx's part was to be the prophet of socialism,\r\nnot a prophet in the vulgar sense of a mere prognosticator, but in the\r\nold Hebrew sense of an inspired voice crying in a wilderness of\r\nunbelief. Lassalle was no prophet. His function was to reduce\r\nprinciples to action, to engage the forces of the times in the spirit\r\nof the times, and by combat with such weapons as lay to hand to urge\r\nthe cause forward. The word \"agitator\" might have been invented for\r\nhim. He was the first great warrior of socialism. It is no reflection\r\nupon Marx to indicate that the present need of the Social Democracy is\r\nfor warriors rather than for prophets.\r\n\r\nLassalle was one of the great figures of modern German history.\r\nBismarck's judgment of men was of the keenest and his opinion of\r\nLassalle, expressed in a speech before the Reichstag (September 16,\r\n1878) is well known: \"In private life Lassalle possessed an\r\nextraordinary attraction for me, being one of the most brilliant and\r\nmost agreeable men I have ever met, and ambitious in the biggest sense\r\nof the term.\" The eminent classical historian, Boeckh, who knew\r\nLassalle well, compared him to Alcibiades. Heine, in a letter\r\nintroducing Lassalle to a friend, wrote: \"I present to you a new\r\nMirabeau.\" There is much that is striking in either of these\r\nparallels.\r\n\r\nThoughts of what might have been, had Lassalle's career in politics\r\nnot been brought to so melancholy an end, are likely to be idle. Helen\r\nvon Racowitza, the pathetic instrument of his fate, not unnaturally\r\nindulged her fancy in such thoughts. Writing in her old age she\r\nqueries: \"Would he, ... with his incomparable ambition and will, ever\r\nhave been able to adapt himself to the compact edifice of the German\r\nempire? Assuredly it must always have seemed to him like a prison!\" To\r\na woman wracked by remorse it may have been comforting to believe that\r\nwhen the catastrophe occurred the work of the man she once had loved\r\nwas really completed. Doubtless indeed Lassalle himself had begun to\r\nrealize, short as was the period from the foundation of the\r\nWorkingmen's Association to the fatal duel with the Rumanian Yanko,\r\nthat he could not bring his enterprise to a head as quickly as he had\r\nhoped. Doubtless he already saw that the establishment of an\r\nindependent labor party was not a matter of a single hard-fought\r\ncampaign, to be waged and won by the genius of any one great leader,\r\nbut a task requiring long and patient toil and the indefinite\r\npostponement of the sweet joys of victory. Certainly in his last\r\nmonths Lassalle showed an unwise readiness seriously to compromise his\r\nposition for the sake of more immediate success. Had he lived, he\r\nwould soon have discovered that he must retrace those latest steps, or\r\nBismarck, and not he, would have been the actual leader of the first\r\nGerman independent labor party. There was nothing in Lassalle's life\r\nto warrant the assumption that he would deliberately sell his party\r\nfor a mess of pottage. Lassalle had put his hand to the plow and it\r\nwas not in his nature to leave the furrow unturned.\r\n\r\nYet Lassalle's title to greatness must lie less in what he himself\r\nachieved than in the achievements of others in his name. He founded a\r\npolitical party; others have made that party great. But the most\r\nsignal service is the service of the founder, for to found a party is\r\nto generate a living organism which will, in the fullness of time,\r\nexpress the purposes and unite the energies of millions. So it has\r\nbeen with the party of Lassalle. Like the husbandman who casts his\r\nseed on good ground, he implanted the germs of the Social-Democracy in\r\nthe hearts of his country's workingmen when the time was ripe for the\r\nsowing. It is enough to secure his fame that he had the vision to see\r\nthat the time was ripe and the strength to break the ground.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_FERDINAND LASSALLE_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WORKINGMEN'S PROGRAMME (1862)\r\n\r\nTRANSLATED BY E.H. BABBITT, A.B.\r\n\r\nAssistant Professor of German, Tufts College\r\n\r\n\r\nGentlemen: Requested to deliver an address before you, I have thought\r\nit best to choose, and to treat in a strictly scientific way, a\r\nsubject, which, from its nature, must be particularly interesting to\r\nyou, namely, the special relation of the character of the historical\r\nperiod in which we are living to the idea of a working class.\r\n\r\nI have said that my treatment of the subject will be purely\r\nscientific.\r\n\r\nA true scientific attitude, however, is nothing more than perfect\r\nclearness, and therefore the complete separation of our thinking from\r\nany preconceived notion. For the sake of this complete absence of\r\npreconceived notions with which we must approach the subject, it will\r\neven be necessary, in the course of the discussion, to form a clear\r\nconception of what we really mean by the term \"workingmen\" or \"working\r\nclass.\" For even on this point we must not admit any preconceived\r\nnotion, as if these terms were something perfectly well\r\nunderstood--which is by no means the case. The language of common life\r\nvery frequently attaches at different times different conceptions to\r\nthe words \"workingman\" or \"working class,\" and we must therefore, in\r\ndue time, get a clear conception as to what meaning we will attach to\r\nthese designations.\r\n\r\nWith this problem, however, we are not concerned at the present\r\nmoment. We must rather begin this presentation with a different\r\nquestion: The working class is only one class among several which\r\ntogether form the body politic, and there have been workingmen at\r\nevery historical period. How, then, is it possible, and what does the\r\nstatement mean, that a particular connection exists between the idea\r\nof this special definite class and the principle of the particular\r\nhistorical period in which we are living?\r\n\r\nTo understand this it is desirable to take a glance into history--into\r\nthe past, which properly interpreted, here, as everywhere, gives us\r\nthe key to the present and points out to us an outline of the future.\r\nIn this retrospect we must be as brief as possible, or we shall be in\r\ndanger (in the short time which is before us) of not reaching at all\r\nthe essential subject of the discussion. But even at this risk we\r\nshall at least be obliged to cast such a glance into the past, even if\r\nit is limited to the most general considerations, in order to\r\nunderstand the import of our question and of our subject.\r\n\r\nIf, then, we go back to the Middle Ages, we shall find, in general,\r\nthat the same classes and divisions of the population which today\r\ncompose the body politic were already in existence, although by no\r\nmeans so fully developed; but we find, furthermore, that at that time\r\none class, one element, is predominate--the landholding element. It is\r\nland proprietorship which in the Middle Ages is the controlling\r\ninfluence in every particular, which has put its own special stamp\r\nupon all the institutions and upon the whole life of the time: it must\r\nbe pronounced the ruling principle of that period.\r\n\r\nThe reason why land ownership is the ruling principle of that time is\r\na very simple one. It lies--at least this reason is quite sufficient\r\nfor our present purposes--in the economic conditions of the Middle\r\nAges and in the state of development of production. Commerce was then\r\nvery slightly developed, manufactures still less. The chief wealth of\r\nevery community consisted, in greatest measure, in the products of\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\nPersonal property at that time, in comparison with the ownership of\r\nreal estate, came only slightly into consideration; how far this was\r\nthe case is shown very plainly by property law, which always gives a\r\nvery clear criterion for the economic relations of the period in which\r\nit arises. Medieval property law, for instance, with the object of\r\nholding the property of families from generation to generation and\r\nprotecting it from dissipation, declared family property or \"estate\"\r\ninalienable without the consent of the heirs; but by this family\r\nproperty or \"estate\" was expressly understood only real estate.\r\nPersonal or portable property, on the other hand, could be disposed of\r\nwithout the consent of the heirs; and in general all personal property\r\nwas treated by the old German law not as an independent\r\nself-perpetuating basis of property (capital), but always as the fruit\r\nof the soil--in the same way, for instance, as the annual crop from\r\nthe soil--and was subject to the same legal conditions as the latter.\r\nNothing but real estate was then regularly treated as an independent\r\nself-perpetuating basis of property. It is therefore entirely in\r\nkeeping with this condition of things, and a simple consequence of it,\r\nthat landed property and those who had it in their hands almost\r\nexclusively--the nobility and clergy--formed the ruling factor, from\r\nevery point of view, in the society of that period.\r\n\r\nWhatever institution of the Middle Ages you may consider, you meet\r\nthis phenomenon at every point. It will suffice us to glance at a few\r\nof the most essential of these institutions in which landholding\r\nappears as a ruling principle.\r\n\r\nFirst: The organization of the public power given by it, or the Feudal\r\nSystem. The essential point of this was that kings, princes and lords\r\nceded to other lords and knights land for their use, in return for\r\nwhich the recipient had to promise military vassalage--that is, he had\r\nto support the feudal lord in his wards or feuds, both in person and\r\nwith retainers.\r\n\r\nSecond: The organization of public law, or the constitution of\r\nthe empire. In the German parliaments the princes and the large\r\nlandholdings of the counts, the empire, and of the clergy were\r\nrepresented. The cities had the right to a seat or a vote only if they\r\nhad succeeded in acquiring the privileges of an imperial free city.\r\n\r\nThird: The exemption from taxation of the large landholdings. It is a\r\ncharacteristic and constantly recurring phenomenon that every ruling\r\nprivileged class tries constantly to throw the burden of the\r\nmaintenance of the State, in open or disguised manner, in direct or\r\nindirect form, on the propertyless classes. When Richelieu, in 1641,\r\ndemanded six million francs from the clergy as an extraordinary\r\nrevenue, the latter gave, through the archbishop of Sens, the\r\ncharacteristic answer: \"L'usage ancien de l'église pendant sa vigeur\r\nétait que le peuple contribuait ses biens, la noblesse son sang, le\r\nclergé ses prières aux necessités de l'État.\" (The ancient custom of\r\nthe church in her prosperity was that the people contributed to the\r\nneeds of the State their property, the nobility their blood, the\r\nclergy their prayers.)\r\n\r\nFourth: The social stigma that rested upon all work other than\r\noccupation of the soil. To conduct manufacturing enterprises, to\r\nacquire money by commerce and manual trades, was considered\r\ndisgraceful and dishonorable for the two privileged ruling classes,\r\nthe nobility and the clergy, for whom it was regarded as honorable to\r\nobtain their revenue from landownership only.\r\n\r\nThese four great and determining motives which established the basic\r\ncharacter of the period are entirely sufficient, for our purpose, to\r\nshow how it was that landed property put its stamp upon that epoch and\r\nformed its ruling principle.\r\n\r\nThis was so far the case that even the movement of the Peasant War,\r\nwhich apparently was completely revolutionary--the one which broke out\r\nin Germany in 1524 and involved all Swabia, Franconia, Alsace,\r\nWestphalia, and other parts of Germany--depended absolutely upon\r\nthis same principle, and was therefore in fact a reactionary movement\r\nin spite of its revolutionary attitude. The peasants at that time\r\nburned down the castles of the nobles, killed the nobles themselves,\r\nand made them run the gauntlet according to the custom of the times;\r\nbut, nevertheless, in spite of this externally revolutionary\r\nappearance, the movement was essentially thoroughly reactionary. For\r\nthe new birth of State relations--the German freedom which the\r\npeasants desired to establish--was to consist, according to their\r\nideas, in the abolition of the special and intermediary position which\r\nthe princes occupied between the emperor and the empire, and, in its\r\nstead, the representation in the German parliament of nothing but free\r\nand independent landed property, including that of the peasants and\r\nknights (these two classes up to this time not having been\r\nrepresented), as well as the individual independent estates of the\r\nnobles of every degree--knights, counts, and princes, without regard\r\nto former differences; and, on the other hand, of the landed property\r\nof the nobles as well as of the peasants.\r\n\r\nIt is clear at once, then, that this plan, in the last instance,\r\nresults in nothing more than still more logical, clear, and equitable\r\ncarrying-out of the principle which had formed the basis of the\r\nhistorical period which was even then approaching its end; that is,\r\nlandownership was to be the ruling element and the only condition\r\nwhich entitled anybody to participation in the government of the\r\nState: that anybody should demand such participation just because he\r\nwas a man, because he was a reasonable being, even without owning any\r\nland--this did not occur to the peasants in the remotest degree! For\r\nthis the conditions of the time were not sufficiently developed, the\r\nmethod of thought of the time was not revolutionary enough.\r\n\r\nSo then this peasant uprising, which came forward externally with such\r\nrevolutionary determination, was in its essence completely\r\nreactionary; that is to say, instead of standing upon a new\r\nrevolutionary principle, it stood unconsciously on the old,\r\nexisting principle of the period which was then just closing; and just\r\nbecause it was reactionary, while it thought itself revolutionary, did\r\nthe peasant uprising fail.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, in comparison with the uprising of the peasants as well\r\nas that of the nobles under Franz von Sickingen--both of which had the\r\nprinciple in common of basing participation in the government, more\r\ndefinitely than had before been the case, upon landholding--the rising\r\nmonarchical idea was relatively a justifiable and revolutionary\r\nfactor, since it was based upon the idea of a state sovereignty\r\nindependent of landholding, representing the national idea independent\r\nof private property relations; and it was just this which gave it the\r\npower for a victorious development and for the suppression of the\r\nuprising of the peasants and the nobles.\r\n\r\nI have gone into this point somewhat explicitly, in the first place to\r\nshow the reasonableness and the progress of liberty in the development\r\nof history, even by an example in which this is not at all evident on\r\nsuperficial observation; in the second place, because historians are\r\nstill far from recognizing this reactionary character of the peasant\r\nuprising and the reason for its failure, which lay chiefly in this\r\naspect; but, rather deceived by external appearances, they have\r\nconsidered the Peasant War a truly revolutionary movement.\r\n\r\nFinally, in the third place, because at all ages this phenomenon is\r\nfrequently repeated--that men who do not think clearly (among whom are\r\noften found those apparently most highly educated, even professors)\r\nhave fallen into the tremendous mistake of taking for a new\r\nrevolutionary principle what is only a more logical and clear\r\nexpression of the thought of a period and of institutions which are\r\njust passing away.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, let me warn you against such men, who are revolutionists\r\nonly in their own imaginations, and such tendencies, because we shall\r\nhave them in the future as we have had them in the past. We can also\r\nderive consolation from the fact that the numerous movements which,\r\nafter momentary success, have immediately, or in a short time, come to\r\nnaught again, which we find in history and which may cloud the\r\nsuperficial vision of many a patriot with gloomy forebodings, have\r\nnever been revolutionary movements except in imagination. A true\r\nrevolutionary movement, one which rests upon a really new idea, as the\r\nmore thoughtful man can prove from history to his consolation, has\r\nnever yet failed, at least not permanently.\r\n\r\nI return to my main subject. If the Peasant Wars are revolutionary\r\nonly in imagination, what was really and truly revolutionary at that\r\ntime was the advance in manufacturing--the production of the middle\r\nclass, the constantly developing division of labor, and the resulting\r\nwealth in capital, which accumulated exclusively in the hands of the\r\nmiddle class because it was just this class that devoted itself to\r\nproduction and reaped its profits.\r\n\r\nIt is usual to date the end of the Middle Ages and the beginning of\r\nmodern history from the Reformation--accordingly, from the year 1517.\r\nThis is correct in the sense that, in the two centuries immediately\r\nfollowing the Reformation, a slow, gradual, and unnoticed change took\r\nplace, which completely transformed the aspect of society and\r\naccomplished within it a revolution that later, in 1789, was merely\r\nproclaimed, not actually produced, by the French Revolution.\r\n\r\nDo you ask in what this transformation consisted?\r\n\r\nIn the legal position of the nobility there had been no change.\r\nLegally the nobility and the clergy had remained the two ruling\r\nclasses, and the middle class the class universally kept down and\r\noppressed. But although there had legally been no change, yet actually\r\nthe reversal of conditions had been all the more tremendous.\r\n\r\nBy the production and accumulation of capital and of personal\r\nproperty, in contrast to real estate, in the hands of the\r\nmiddle class, the nobility had dwindled into complete\r\ninsignificance--even into actual dependence upon the enriched middle\r\nclass. If the nobles wished to maintain their place beside the middle\r\nclass, they must renounce all class traditions and begin to adopt the\r\nsame methods of industrial acquisition to which the middle class owed\r\ntheir wealth and in consequence their _de facto_ power. The comedies\r\nof Molière, who lived at the time of Louis XIV., show us, as an\r\nextremely interesting phenomenon, the nobles of the times despising\r\nthe rich middle class and at the same time playing the parasite at its\r\ntables. Louis XIV. himself, this proudest of monarchs, takes off his\r\nhat in his palace at Versailles and humbles himself before the Jew,\r\nSamuel Bernard, the Rothschild of the times, in order to influence him\r\nin favor of a loan.\r\n\r\nWhen Law, the famous Scotch financier, at the beginning of the\r\neighteenth century, formed in France his trading companies--a stock\r\ncorporation which was formed for the exploitation of the Mississippi\r\nregion, the East Indies, etc., the Regent of France himself was on its\r\ndirectorate--a member of a merchant company! The Regent found himself\r\nin fact compelled in August, 1717, to issue edicts in virtue of which\r\nthe nobles might, without loss of dignity, enter into the naval and\r\nmilitary service of these trading companies! To that point, then, the\r\nwarlike and proud feudal aristocracy of France had fallen--to be the\r\narmed employees of the industrial and commercial enterprises of the\r\nmiddle class, whose relations extended through all continents.\r\n\r\nCorresponding to this radical change, there had already developed a\r\nmaterialism and an eager, grasping struggle for money and property\r\nwhich could overcome all moral ideas and (what I regret to say was\r\ngenerally still more significant for the privileged classes) even all\r\nprivileges of rank. Under this same Regent of France, Count Horn, one\r\nof the highest of the aristocracy and connected with the first\r\nfamilies of France, even with the Regent himself, was broken on the\r\nwheel as a common robber and murderer; and the Duchess of Orleans, a\r\nGerman princess, writes in a letter of November 29, 1719, that six\r\nladies of the highest rank waylaid in the court of a building the\r\nabove-mentioned Law, who was at that time the most courted and the\r\nbusiest man in France and therefore very hard to interview, in order\r\nto induce him to dispose of some of the shares founded by him, for\r\nwhich at that time all France was competing and which brought on the\r\nExchange six and eight times the nominal price at which Law had issued\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIf you ask me again what the causes were which made possible this\r\ndevelopment of manufacturing and the consequent wealth of the middle\r\nclass, I should have to exceed, if I tried to give them thorough\r\ntreatment, the time at my disposal. I can only enumerate for you the\r\nmost essential ones: The discovery of America and its tremendous\r\ninfluence on production; the route to the East Indies around the Cape\r\nof Good Hope, taking the place of the former land route by way of Suez\r\nfor all trade with the East Indies; the discovery of the magnetic\r\nneedle and the invention of the mariner's compass, and in consequence\r\ngreater safety and speed and lower insurance rates for all ocean\r\ntraffic; the waterways established in the interior of the countries,\r\nthe canals, also the good roads which made possible for the first time\r\na more remote market through the lessening of the transportation costs\r\nof various commodities which formerly could not carry the raise in\r\nprice thus caused; greater security of property; well-established\r\ncourts of law; the invention of powder, and, in consequence of this\r\ninvention, the breaking down by the monarchy of the feudal military\r\npower of the nobility; the dismissal of the mercenaries and mounted\r\nretainers of the nobles on account of the destruction of their castles\r\nand of their independent military power. For these retainers there was\r\nnow nothing left but to find work in the medieval workshops. All these\r\nevents gave impetus to the triumphal chariot of the middle class. All\r\nthese events, and many more which might be enumerated, combined to\r\nproduce this one effect. By the opening of wider markets and the\r\naccompanying reduction of the costs of production and transportation,\r\nthere comes production for the world-market, and consequently the\r\nnecessity for cheap production which, in its turn, can be met only by\r\na constantly extending division of labor, i.e., by the more perfectly\r\ndeveloped division of the work into its simplest mechanical processes;\r\nthis in turn brings about a constantly increasing output.\r\n\r\nWe are on the ground here of action and reaction. Each of these\r\ncircumstances is a cause for the other, and the latter then reacts\r\nupon the former, and extends it and increases its scope.\r\n\r\nIt must be clear that the production of an article in enormous\r\nquantities--its production for the world-market--is, in general,\r\npossible only if the costs of production of the article are low and if\r\nalso its transportation is cheap enough not to raise its price\r\nessentially. Production in enormous quantities demands a wholesale\r\nmarket, and a wholesale market for any commodity can be obtained only\r\nby its low price, which makes it available for a very large number of\r\nconsumers; thus the low cost of production and transportation of any\r\ncommodity brings about its production on a huge scale in enormous\r\nquantities. It must also be clear, on the other hand, that the\r\nproduction of a commodity in enormous quantities causes and increases\r\nits cheapness. A manufacturer, for instance, who turns out 200,000\r\npieces of cotton goods in a year, is able, because he procures his raw\r\nmaterial more cheaply on a large scale and because the profit on his\r\ncapital and the interest on his plant is distributed over so large a\r\nnumber of pieces, to market each piece, within certain limits, at a\r\nfar lower price than the manufacturer who produces yearly only 5,000\r\nsuch pieces. Greater cheapness of production leads accordingly to\r\nproduction on a large scale. This results, in turn, in greater\r\ncheapness; this in its own turn brings about production in still\r\ngreater quantities, and this still greater cheapness, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe relations are also quite similar in the matter of division of\r\nlabor, which is another necessary condition for production in large\r\nquantities and for cheapness, for without it neither cheapness of\r\nproduction nor large quantities would be possible.\r\n\r\nThe division of labor which splits up the production of an article\r\ninto a great number of very simple and often purely mechanical\r\noperations requiring no thought on the part of the operative, and sets\r\nat each one of these single operations a single workman, would be\r\nentirely impossible without extensive production of this article. It\r\nis therefore established and extended only through such production. On\r\nthe other hand, this division of the work into simple operations leads\r\n(1), to a constantly increasing cheapness; (2), to production in\r\nenormous and constantly increasing quantities--a production calculated\r\nnot only for this or that neighboring market, but for the entire\r\nworld-market; and (3), through this and through new divisions which\r\ncan for this reason be applied to single operations, to still farther\r\nadvances in the division of labor itself.\r\n\r\nBy this series of actions and reactions there had accordingly appeared\r\na complete transformation in the manufacturing institutions of the\r\ncommunity and hence in all its relations of life. The best way to\r\nstate this briefly is to reduce it to the following contrast:\r\n\r\nIn the early Middle Ages, since only a small number of very valuable\r\nproducts could stand the expense of transportation, production was\r\ncalculated for the need of the immediate locality and a very limited\r\nneighboring market whose demand was, just for this reason, a\r\nwell-known, steady, and unchanging one. The need or the demand\r\npreceded production and formed a well-known criterion for it; in other\r\nwords, the production of the community had been chiefly artisan\r\nproduction. Now, in distinction from factory or wholesale production,\r\nthe character of small or artisan production is this: Either the need\r\nis awaited before production--as, for example, a tailor waits for my\r\norder before he makes me a coat, a locksmith before he makes me a\r\nlock; or even if some goods are manufactured to be sold ready-made, on\r\nthe whole this ready-made business is limited to a minimum of what is\r\ndefinitely known from experience to be the needs of the immediate\r\nlocality and its nearest neighborhood--as, for instance, a tinsmith\r\nmakes up a certain number of lamps, knowing that the local demand will\r\nsoon dispose of them.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of a community producing chiefly in this manner\r\nare poverty, or at least only a moderate prosperity, but, to offset\r\nthis, a certain definiteness and steadiness of all relations.\r\n\r\nNow, on the other hand, through the incessant and complete action and\r\nreaction which I have been describing to you, there had appeared in\r\nthe community a totally different kind of work, and therefore of all\r\nrelations of life. There had already appeared the germ of the same\r\ncharacteristic which today marks, in a differently developed but\r\nenormously extended manner, the production of the community. In the\r\ntremendous development which it has today this characteristic, in\r\ncontrast to that previously described, can be indicated as follows:\r\nWhereas, formerly, need preceded production, made it a consequence of\r\nitself, determined it, and formed a criterion and well-known standard\r\nfor it--production and supply now go in advance of the demand and try\r\nto develop it. Production is no longer for the locality, no longer for\r\nthe well-known need of neighboring markets, but for the world-market.\r\nProduction goes on for remote regions and for a general market, for\r\nall continents, for an actually unknown and not definitely calculated\r\nneed; and in order that the product may arouse need a weapon is\r\nsupplied it--cheapness. Cheapness is the weapon of a product, with\r\nwhich, on the one hand, it obtains customers, and, on the other,\r\ndrives from the field other goods of the same nature, which are likewise\r\nurged upon the consumers; so that under the system of free\r\ncompetition any producer may hope, no matter what enormous quantities\r\nhe may produce, to find a market for them all if he only succeeds, by\r\nmaking his goods exceedingly cheap, in keeping out of the market the\r\ngoods of his competitors. The predominant character of such a society\r\nis vast and boundless wealth, but, on the other hand, a great\r\ninstability of all relations, an almost continual, anxious insecurity\r\nin the position of each individual, together with a very unequal\r\nsharing of the returns of production among those taking part in it.\r\n\r\nThus great had been the changes brought about, unnoticed in the heart\r\nof society, by the revolutionary and all-pervading activity of\r\nindustrialism, even before the end of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nThough the men of the Peasant Wars had not ventured any other\r\nconception than that of founding the State upon land ownership, though\r\nthey had not, even in thought, been able to free themselves from the\r\nview that land ownership is necessarily the element which holds\r\nsovereignty over the State and that participation in that ownership is\r\nthe condition for participation in that sovereignty, yet the quiet,\r\nimperceptible, revolutionary progress of industrialism had brought\r\nabout the condition that, long before the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, land ownership had become an element stripped entirely of its\r\nformer importance, and had fallen to a subordinate position, in the\r\nface of the development of new methods of production, of the wealth\r\nwhich this development bore in its bosom and increased from day to\r\nday, and of the influence which it clearly had on all the people and\r\ntheir affairs--even upon the largely impoverished nobility.\r\n\r\nThe revolution was therefore an accomplished fact in the actual\r\nrelations of society long before it broke out in France; and it was\r\nonly necessary to bring this reversal of conditions to outward\r\nrecognition to give it legal sanction. This is always the case in\r\nall revolutions. You can never make a revolution. You can only give\r\nexternal legal recognition and logical embodiment in practice to a\r\nrevolution which has already become an actuality in the essential\r\nrelations of society. Trying to make a revolution is the folly of\r\nimmature men who have no conception of the laws of history.\r\n\r\nPrecisely for this reason it is just as immature and childish to\r\nsuppress a revolution already fully formed in the womb of society and\r\nto oppose its legal recognition, or to reproach those who assist at\r\nits birth with being revolutionary. If the revolution is at hand in\r\nthe actual conditions of society, nothing can prevent its appearing\r\nand passing into legislation.\r\n\r\nHow these things were related, and how far they had already gone in\r\nthis direction in the period of which I speak, you will best see from\r\nanother matter which I will mention.\r\n\r\nI have already spoken about the division of labor, the development of\r\nwhich consists of separating all production into a series of entirely\r\nsimple mechanical operations requiring no thought on the part of the\r\noperator. As this separation progresses farther and farther, the\r\ndiscovery is finally made that these single operations, because they\r\nare quite simple and call for no thought, can be accomplished just as\r\nwell, and even better, by unthinking agents; and so in 1775, fourteen\r\nyears before the French Revolution, Arkwright invented the first\r\nmachine, his famous spinning-jenny.\r\n\r\nWe can see that the machine in itself was not the cause of the\r\nrevolution. Too little time intervened between this invention, which\r\nfurthermore was not immediately introduced into France, and the\r\nrevolution; but it embodied in itself the actually incipient and fully\r\nripe revolution. This machine, however innocent it seemed, was in fact\r\nthe revolution personified. The reasons for this are simple. You, of\r\ncourse, have heard of the guild system, by which production in the\r\nMiddle Ages was directed. The guild system of the Middle Ages was\r\ninseparably connected with other institutions. The guilds lasted\r\nthrough the whole medieval period up to the French Revolution; but as\r\nearly as 1672 the matter of their abolition was considered in the\r\nGerman parliament, though without result. Even in 1614, in the French\r\n_États Généraux_, the abolition of the guilds was demanded by the\r\nmiddle class, whose production the guilds everywhere restricted; but\r\nalso without result. Indeed thirteen years before the Revolution, in\r\n1776, a minister of the Reformed party in France, the famous Turgot,\r\nabolished the guilds, but the privileged world of medieval feudalism\r\nconsidered itself, and with perfect justice, in mortal danger if its\r\nvital principle of privilege did not extend to all classes of society;\r\nand so, six months after the abolition of the guilds, the king was\r\nempowered to revoke this edict and to reestablish the guilds. Nothing\r\nbut the Revolution could overthrow (and it did overthrow in one day,\r\nby the capture of the Bastille) that which in Germany had been vainly\r\nassailed since 1672 and in France since 1614--for almost two\r\ncenturies--by legal means.\r\n\r\nYou see from this, Gentlemen, that however great the advantages of\r\nreformation by legal means are, such means have nevertheless in all\r\nthe more important points one great disadvantage--that of being\r\nabsolutely powerless for whole centuries; and, furthermore, that the\r\nrevolutionary means, undeniable as its disadvantages are, has as a\r\ncompensation the advantage of attaining quickly and effectively a\r\npractical result.\r\n\r\nIf you will now keep in mind that the guilds were connected in an\r\ninseparable manner with the whole social arrangement of the Middle\r\nAges, you will see at once how the first machine, Arkwright's\r\nspinning-jenny, embodied a complete revolution in those social\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nFor how could machine production be possible under the guild system,\r\nin which the number of journeymen and apprentices a master workman\r\ncould employ was determined by law in each locality; or how, under\r\nthe guild system, in which the different trades were distinguished by\r\nlaw from one another in the most exact manner, and each master could\r\ncarry on only one of them--so that, for instance, the tailors and the\r\nnail-makers of Paris for centuries had lawsuits with the menders of\r\nclothes and the locksmiths, in order to draw lines between their\r\nrespective trades--how, under such a guild system, could production be\r\npossible with a system of machines which requires the union of the\r\nmost varied departments of work under the control of one and the same\r\nmanagement?\r\n\r\nIt had come to the point, then, that production itself had called into\r\nbeing, by its constant and gradual development, instruments of\r\nproduction which must necessarily destroy the existing condition of\r\nthings--instruments and methods of production which, under the guild\r\nsystem, could no longer find place and opportunity for development.\r\n\r\nThus considered, I call the first machine in itself a revolution; for\r\nit bore in its wheels and cogs, little as this could be seen on\r\nexternal observation, the germ of the new condition of things, based\r\nupon free competition, which must necessarily develop from this germ\r\nwith the power and irresistibility of life itself.\r\n\r\nAnd so, if I am not greatly mistaken, it may be true today that there\r\nexist various phenomena which imply a new condition that must\r\ninevitably develop from them--phenomena which, at this time also,\r\ncannot be understood from external conditions; so that the authorities\r\nthemselves, while persecuting insignificant agitators, not only\r\noverlook these phenomena, but even let them stand as necessary\r\naccompaniments of our civilization, hail them as the climax of\r\nprosperity, and, on occasion, make appreciative and approving speeches\r\nin their honor.\r\n\r\nAfter all these discussions you will now understand the true meaning\r\nof the famous pamphlet published by Abbé Sieyes in 1788--and so before\r\nthe French Revolution--which was summed up in these words: _\"Qu'est-ce\r\nque c'est que le tiers état? rien! qu' est qu'il doit être? Tout!\"\r\nTiers état_, or third class, is what the middle class in France was\r\ncalled, because they formed, in contrast to the two privileged\r\nclasses, the nobility and the clergy, a third class, which meant all\r\nthe people without privilege. This pamphlet brings together the two\r\nquestions raised by Sieyes, and their answers: \"What is the third\r\nclass? Nothing! What ought it to be? Everything.\" This is how Sieyes\r\nformulates these two questions and answers. But from all that has been\r\nsaid, the true meaning of these questions and answers would be more\r\nclearly and correctly expressed as follows: \"What is the third class\r\n_de facto_--in reality? Everything! But what is it _de jure_--legally?\r\nNothing!\"\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done, then, was to bring the legal position of the\r\nthird class into harmony with its actual meaning; to clothe its\r\nimportance, already existing in fact, with legal sanction and\r\nrecognition; and just this is the achievement and significance of the\r\nvictorious revolution which broke out in France in 1789 and exerted\r\nits transforming influence on the other countries of Europe.\r\n\r\nThis question arises here: What was this third class, or\r\n_bourgeoisie_, that through the French Revolution obtained victory\r\nover the privileged classes and gained control of the State? Since\r\nthis third class stood in contrast to the privileged classes of\r\nsociety with legal vested rights, it considered itself at that time as\r\nequivalent to the whole people, and its cause as the cause of all\r\nhumanity. This explains the exalting and mighty enthusiasm which was\r\ngeneral in that period. The rights of man were proclaimed; and it\r\nseemed as if, with the liberation and sovereignty of this third class,\r\nall legal privileges in society were ended, and as if every legally\r\nprivileged distinction had been replaced by its principle of the\r\nuniversal liberty of man.\r\n\r\nAt that time, however, in the very beginning of the movement, in\r\nApril, 1789, on the occasion of the elections to a parliament which\r\nwas summoned by the king under the condition that the third class\r\nshould this time send as many representatives as the nobility and\r\nclergy together, a newspaper of a character anything but revolutionary\r\nwrites as follows: \"Who can tell us whether a despotism of the\r\nbourgeoisie will not follow the so-called aristocracy of the nobles?\"\r\n\r\nBut such cries at that time were drowned in the general enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nNevertheless we must come back to that question, we must put the\r\nquestion definitely: Was the cause of the third class really the cause\r\nof all humanity; or did this third class, the _bourgeoisie_, bear\r\nwithin it a fourth class, from which it wished to distinguish itself\r\nclearly, and subject it to its sovereignty?\r\n\r\nI must now, if I do not wish to run the risk of subjecting my\r\npresentation to great misunderstandings, explain my own conception of\r\nthe word _bourgeoisie_, or upper _bourgeoisie_, as a term for a\r\npolitical party. The word _bourgeoisie_ may be translated into German\r\nby _Bürgertum_ (body of citizens). In my opinion this is not what it\r\nmeans. We are all _Bürger_ (citizens)--the working man, the\r\n_Kleinbürger_ (lower middle class), _Grossbürger_ (upper middle\r\nclass), etc. But in the course of history the word _bourgeoisie_ has\r\nacquired the significance of a definite political tendency, which I\r\nwill now explain.[47]\r\n\r\nThe whole class of commoners outside the nobility was divided, when the\r\nFrench Revolution began, and is still divided in general, into two\r\nsubordinate classes--first, those who get their living chiefly or\r\nentirely from their labor, and are supported in this by very little\r\ncapital, or none at all, which might give them the possibility of\r\nactively engaging in production for the support of themselves and their\r\nfamilies; to this class, accordingly, belong the laborers, the lower\r\nmiddle class, the artisans, and, in general, the peasants; second, those\r\nwho control a large amount of property and capital, and on that basis\r\nengage in production or receive an income from it. These can be called\r\nthe capitalists; but no capitalist is a _bourgeois_ merely because of\r\nhis wealth.\r\n\r\nNo commoner has any objection to a nobleman's rejoicing privately over\r\nhis ancestry and his landed estates. But if the nobleman tries to make\r\nthese ancestors or these landed estates the condition of special\r\ninfluence and privilege in the government, of control over public\r\npolicy, then the anger of the commoner rises against the nobleman and\r\nhe calls him a feudalist.\r\n\r\nConditions are the same with reference to the actual difference of\r\nproperty within the class of commoners. If the capitalist rejoices in\r\nprivate over the great convenience and advantage which a large estate\r\nimplies for the holder, nothing is more simple, more moral, and more\r\nlawful.\r\n\r\nTo whatever extent the laborer and the poorer citizen--in a word, all\r\nclasses outside the capitalists--are entitled to demand from the State\r\nthat its whole thought and effort be directed toward improving the\r\nlamentable and poverty-stricken material condition of the working\r\nclasses and toward assuring to them, through whose hands all the\r\nwealth is produced of which our civilization boasts, to whose hands\r\nall products owe their being, without whom society as a whole could\r\nnot exist another day, a more abundant and less uncertain revenue, and\r\nthus the possibility of intellectual culture, and, in time, an\r\nexistence really worthy of a human being--however much, I say, the\r\nworking classes are entitled to demand this from the State and to\r\nestablish this as its true object, the workingmen must and will never\r\nforget that all property once lawfully acquired is completely\r\ninviolable and legitimate.\r\n\r\nBut if the capitalist, not satisfied with the actual advantages of\r\nlarge property, tries to establish the possession of capital as a\r\ncondition for participation in the control of the State and in the\r\ndetermination of public policy, then the capitalist becomes a\r\n_bourgeois_, then he makes the fact of possession the legal condition\r\nof political control, then he characterizes himself as a new\r\nprivileged class which attempts to put the controlling stamp of its\r\nprivileges upon all social institutions in as full a degree as the\r\nnobility in the Middle Ages did with the privilege of landholding.\r\n\r\nThe question therefore which we must raise with reference to the\r\nFrench Revolution and the period of history inaugurated by it, is the\r\nfollowing: Has the third class, which came into control through the\r\nFrench Revolution, looked upon itself as a _bourgeoisie_ in this\r\nsense, and has it attempted successfully to subject the people to its\r\nprivileged political control?\r\n\r\nThe answer is given by the great facts of history, and this answer is\r\ndefinitely in the affirmative. In the very first constitution which\r\nfollowed the French Revolution--the one of September 3, 1791--the\r\ndifference between _citoyen actif_ and _citoyen passif_--the \"active\"\r\nand \"passive\" citizen--is set forth. Only the active citizens received\r\nthe franchise, and the active citizen, according to this constitution,\r\nis no other than one who pays a direct tax of a definitely stated\r\namount.\r\n\r\nThis tax was at that time very moderate. It was only the value of\r\nthree days' work: but what was more important was that all those were\r\ndeclared passive citizens who were _serviteurs à gages_ (wage\r\nearners), a definition by which the working class was expressly\r\nexcluded from the franchise. After all, in such questions the\r\nessential point is not the extent, but the principle.\r\n\r\nThis meant the introduction of a property qualification, the\r\nestablishment of a definite amount of property as the condition of the\r\nfranchise--this first and most important of all political rights--and\r\nin the determination of public policy.\r\n\r\nAll those who paid no direct tax at all, or less than this fixed\r\namount, and those who were wage earners, were excluded from control of\r\nthe State and were made a subject body. The ownership of capital had\r\nbecome the condition for control over the State, as was nobility, or\r\nownership of land, in the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nThis principle of property qualification remains (with the exception\r\nof a very short period during the French Republic of 1793, which\r\nperished from its own indefiniteness and from the whole state of\r\nsociety at the time, which I cannot here discuss further) the leading\r\nprinciple of all constitutions which originated in the French\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nIn fact, with the consistency which all principles have, this one was\r\nsoon forced to develop into a different quantitative scope. In the\r\nconstitution of 1814, according to the classified list promulgated by\r\nLouis XVIII., a direct tax of three hundred francs (eighty thalers)\r\nwas established, in place of the value of three days' work, as a\r\ncondition of the franchise. The July Revolution of 1830 broke out, and\r\nnevertheless, by the law of April 19, 1831, a direct tax of two\r\nhundred francs (about fifty-three thalers) was required as a condition\r\nof the franchise.\r\n\r\nWhat under Louis Philippe and Guizot was called the _pays légal_--that\r\nis, the country as a legal entity--consisted of 200,000 men; for there\r\nwere not more than 200,000 electors in France who could meet the\r\nproperty requirement, and these exercised sovereignty over more than\r\n30,000,000 inhabitants. It is here to be noted that it makes no\r\ndifference whether the principle of property qualification, the\r\nexclusion of those without property from the franchise, appears, as in\r\nthe constitutions referred to, in direct and open form, or in a form\r\nin one way or another disguised. The effect is always the same.\r\n\r\nSo the second French Republic in 1850 could not possibly revoke the\r\ngeneral direct franchise, once proclaimed, which we shall later\r\nconsider, but adopted the expedient of granting the franchise (law of\r\nMay 31,1850) only to such citizens as had been domiciled in a place\r\nwithout interruption for at least three years. For, because workingmen\r\nin France are frequently compelled by conditions to change their\r\ndomicile and to look for work in another commune, it was hoped, and\r\nwith good reason, that extremely large numbers of workingmen, who\r\ncould not bring proof of three years uninterrupted residence in the\r\nsame place, would be excluded from the franchise.\r\n\r\nHere you have a property qualification in disguised form. It is still\r\nworse in our country, since the promulgation of the three-class\r\nelection law, under which, with variations according to locality,\r\nthree, ten, thirty, or more voters without property, of the third\r\nclass of electors, have only the same franchise as one single\r\ncapitalist who belongs to the first class; so that, in fact, if the\r\nproportion were only one to ten, nine men out of every ten who had the\r\nfranchise in 1848 have lost it through the three-class election law of\r\n1849, and exercise it only in appearance.[48]\r\n\r\nBut this is only the average situation. In reality, conditions vary\r\ngreatly in different localities, and they are often still more\r\nunfavorable, most unfavorable in fact where the inequality of property\r\nis most developed; thus for instance, in Düsseldorf twenty-six voters\r\nof the third class have no more power than one rich man.\r\n\r\nIf we return from this discussion to our main thought, we have shown,\r\nand shall continue to show, in what manner, since the time when, through\r\nthe French Revolution, the capitalist element obtained sovereignty, its\r\nprinciple, the possession of capital, has now become the controlling\r\nprinciple of all social institutions; how the capitalist class,\r\nproceeding in just the same manner as the nobility in the Middle Ages\r\nwith land ownership, impresses now the controlling and exclusive stamp\r\nof its particular principle, the possession of capital, upon all\r\ninstitutions of society. The parallel between the nobility and the\r\ncapitalist class is, in this respect, complete. We have already seen\r\nthis with regard to the most important fundamental point, the\r\nconstitution of the Empire. As in the Middle Ages landholding was the\r\nprevailing principle of representation in the German parliaments, so\r\nnow, by a direct or disguised property qualification, the amount of tax,\r\nand therefore, since this is determined by the capital of an individual,\r\nthe holding of capital, is what, in the last instance, determines the\r\nright of election to legislative bodies and therefore of participation\r\nin the control of the State.\r\n\r\nJust so in reference to all other institutions in which I have\r\ndemonstrated to you that land ownership was the controlling principle\r\nin the Middle Ages. I called your attention then to the exemption from\r\ntaxation of the noble landholders of the Middle Ages, and told you\r\nthat every privileged ruling class tries to throw the burden for the\r\nmaintenance of public welfare upon the oppressed propertyless class.\r\nJust so the capitalists. To be sure they cannot declare publicly that\r\nthey wish to be exempt from taxation. Their expressed principle is\r\nrather the rule that everybody shall be taxed in proportion to income;\r\nbut, on the other hand, they attain, at least fairly well, the same\r\nresult in disguised form by the distinction between direct and\r\nindirect taxes.\r\n\r\nDirect taxes are those which, like the classified income tax, are\r\ncollected, and therefore are determined, according to the amount of\r\nincome and capital. Indirect taxes, however, are those which are laid\r\nupon any necessity--for instance, salt, grain, beer, meat, fuel; or on\r\nthe necessity for legal protection--law costs, stamp taxes, etc., and\r\nwhich the individual very frequently pays in the price of the\r\ncommodity without knowing or perceiving that he is being taxed, that\r\nthe tax increases the price.\r\n\r\nNow no man, of course, who is twenty, fifty, or a hundred times as\r\nrich as another eats by any means twenty, fifty or a hundred times as\r\nmuch salt, or bread, or meat; or drinks fifty or a hundred times as\r\nmuch beer or wine; or has fifty or a hundred times as much need for\r\nheat, and therefore for fuel, as the workingman or the relatively poor\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThe result of this is that all indirect taxes, instead of falling\r\nupon individuals according to the proportion of their capital and\r\nincome, are paid in the main by the propertyless classes, the poorer\r\nclasses of the nation. It is true that the capitalists did not invent\r\nindirect taxes--they were already in existence--but they were the\r\nfirst to develop them into a monstrous system and to throw upon them\r\nnearly the whole cost of government. To make this clear to you, I will\r\nsimply allude to the Prussian financial administration of 1855. (Shows\r\nby official statistics that out of a budget of 109,000,000 thalers all\r\nbut 12,800,000 were derived from indirect taxes.)\r\n\r\nIndirect taxation is therefore the institution through which the\r\ncapitalistic class obtains the privilege of exemption for its capital\r\nand lays the cost of the government upon the poorer classes of\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nObserve, at the same time, Gentlemen, the peculiar contradiction and\r\nthe strange kind of justice of the procedure of laying the whole\r\nexpense upon indirect taxation, and therefore upon the poor people,\r\nand of setting up as a test and a condition of the franchise, and\r\ntherefore of political control, the direct taxes, which contribute for\r\nthe total need of the State only the insignificant sum of twelve\r\nmillion out of one hundred and eight million.\r\n\r\nI said further with reference to the nobility of the Middle Ages, that\r\nthey held in contempt all activity and industry of the commoners. The\r\nsituation is the same today. All kinds of work, to be sure, are\r\nequally esteemed today, and if anybody became a millionaire by\r\nrag-picking he would be sure of obtaining a highly esteemed position\r\nin society.\r\n\r\nBut what social contempt falls upon those who, no matter at what they\r\nlabor or how hard they toil, have no capital to back them--that is a\r\nmatter which you, Gentlemen, do not need to be told by me, but can\r\nfind often enough, unfortunately, in your daily life. Indeed, in many\r\nrespects, the capitalist class asserts the supremacy of its special\r\nprivilege with even stricter consistency than the nobility of the\r\nMiddle Ages did with its land ownership. The instruction of the\r\npeople--I mean here of the adult people--was in the Middle Ages the\r\nwork of the clergy. Since then the newspapers have assumed this\r\nfunction; but through the securities a newspaper must give, and still\r\nmore through the stamp tax which is laid in our country, as in France\r\nand elsewhere, on newspapers, a daily newspaper has become a very\r\nexpensive institution, which cannot be established without very\r\nconsiderable capital, with the result that, for this very reason, even\r\nthe opportunity to mold public opinion, instruct it, and guide it has\r\nbecome the privilege of the capitalist class.\r\n\r\nWere this not the case, you would have much different and very much\r\nbetter papers. It is interesting to see how early this attempt of the\r\n_bourgeoisie_ to make the press a privilege of capital appears, and in\r\nwhat frank and undisguised form. On July 24, 1789, a few days after\r\nthe capture of the Bastille, during the first days after the middle\r\nclass obtained political supremacy, the representatives of the city of\r\nParis passed a resolution by which they declared printers responsible\r\nif they published pamphlets or sheets by writers _sans existence\r\nconnue_ (without visible means of support). The newly won freedom of\r\nthe press, then, was to exist only for writers who had visible means\r\nof support. Property thus appears as the condition of the freedom\r\nof the press, indeed of the morality of the writer. The\r\nstraightforwardness of the first days of citizen sovereignty only\r\nexpresses in a childishly frank manner what is today artfully obtained\r\nby bonding and stamp taxes. With these main characteristic facts\r\ncorresponding to our consideration of the Middle Ages we shall have to\r\nbe satisfied here.\r\n\r\nWhat we have seen so far are two historical periods, each of which\r\nstands for the controlling idea of a distinct class, which impresses\r\nits own principle upon all institutions of the time.\r\n\r\nFirst, the idea of the nobility, or land ownership, which forms the\r\ncontrolling principle of the Middle Ages, and permeates all the\r\ninstitutions of that time.\r\n\r\nThis period closed with the French Revolution; though, of course,\r\nespecially in Germany, where this revolution came about, not through\r\nthe people, but in much slower and more complete reforms introduced by\r\nthe governments, numerous and important survivals of that first\r\nhistorical period still exist, preventing to a large extent, even\r\ntoday, complete control by the capitalist class.\r\n\r\nWe observed, second, the period beginning with the French Revolution\r\nat the end of the last century, which has capitalism as its principle\r\nand establishes this as the privilege which permeates all social\r\ninstitutions and determines participation in the public policy. This\r\nperiod is also, little as external appearances indicate, essentially\r\nat an end.\r\n\r\nOn February 24, 1848, the first dawn of a new historical period became\r\nvisible, for on that day in France--that land in whose mighty internal\r\nstruggles the victories as well as the defeats of liberty indicate\r\nvictories and defeats for all mankind--a revolution broke out which\r\nplaced a workingman at the head of the provisional government, which\r\ndeclared the principle of the State to be the improvement of the lot\r\nof the working classes, and proclaimed the universal and direct\r\nfranchise, through which every citizen who had attained his\r\ntwenty-first year, without regard to property, should receive an equal\r\nshare in the control of the State and the determination of public\r\npolicy. You see, Gentlemen, if the Revolution of 1789 was the\r\nrevolution of the _tiers état_ (the third class), this time it is the\r\nfourth class--which in 1789 was still undistinguished from the third\r\nclass and seemed to coincide with it--that now attempts to establish\r\nits own principle as the controlling one of society and to make it\r\npervade all institutions.\r\n\r\nBut here, in the case of the supremacy of the fourth class, we find\r\nthe tremendous distinction that this class is the final and\r\nall-inclusive disinherited class of humanity, which can set up no\r\nfurther exclusive condition, either of legal or actual kind, neither\r\nnobility, land ownership, nor capital, which it might establish as a\r\nnew privilege and carry through the institutions of society.\r\nWorkingmen we all are, so far as we have the desire to make ourselves\r\nuseful to human society in any way whatsoever.\r\n\r\nThis fourth class, in whose bosom therefore no possible germ of a new\r\norder of privilege is concealed, is for that very reason synonymous\r\nwith the whole human race. Its class is, in truth, the class of all\r\nhumanity, its liberty is the liberty of humanity itself, its\r\nsovereignty is the sovereignty of all. Whoever hails the principle of\r\nthe working class, in the sense in which I have developed it, as a\r\ncontrolling principle of society, utters no cry which separates and\r\nmakes hostile to another the classes of society. He utters, rather, a\r\ncry of reconciliation, a cry which includes all society, a cry for the\r\nleveling of all hostilities among the social strata, a cry of accord,\r\nin which all should join who do not wish privilege and the oppression\r\nof the people by privileged classes, a cry of love, which, ever since\r\nit spoke for the first time from the heart of the people, will always\r\nremain the true voice of the people, and, on account of its meaning,\r\nwill still be a cry of love, even if it sounds the battle-cry of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the working class as a controlling principle of\r\nsociety we have still to consider from three points of view--first, as\r\nto the formal means of its realization; second, as to its moral\r\nsignificance; third, as to its political conception of public policy.\r\n\r\nThe formal means for carrying out this principle is the universal and\r\ndirect franchise already discussed--I say the universal and direct\r\nfranchise, not merely the general franchise such as we had in 1848.\r\nThe introduction in elections of two steps--of voters and of\r\nelectors--is nothing but an artful means introduced purposely with the\r\nintention of thwarting, so far as possible, the will of the people in\r\nthe elections. To be sure, the universal and direct franchise will\r\nbe no magic wand, Gentlemen, which can protect you from temporary\r\nmistakes. We have seen in France, in the years 1848 and 1849, two\r\nunfavorable elections in succession, but the universal and direct\r\nfranchise is the only means which automatically corrects, in course of\r\ntime, the mistakes and temporary wrong to which this may lead. It is\r\nthat legendary lance which itself heals the wounds it makes. In the\r\ncourse of time it is impossible, with universal and direct franchise,\r\nfor chosen representatives not to be a completely faithful reflection\r\nof the people who have elected them. The people, therefore, at every\r\ntime will consider universal and direct franchise as an indispensable\r\npolitical weapon, and as the most fundamental and important of their\r\ndemands.\r\n\r\nLet us now glance at the moral bearing of this social principle which\r\nwe are considering.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the idea of the lowest classes of society as the controlling\r\nprinciple of society and of the State may appear very dangerous and\r\nimmoral, one which threatens to expose morality and culture to the\r\ndanger of being overrun by a \"modern barbarism.\"\r\n\r\nAnd it would be no wonder if this thought should appear so at present.\r\nFor even public opinion--I have already indicated by what means,\r\nnamely, through the newspapers--receives today its imprint from the\r\ncoining-die of capital and from the hands of the privileged capitalist\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nNevertheless this fear is only a prejudice; and it can be proved, on\r\nthe contrary, that this thought would represent the highest moral\r\nprogress and triumph which the world's history has shown. That view is\r\na prejudice, I say, and it is the prejudice of the present time, which\r\nis still controlled by privilege.\r\n\r\nAt another time--at the time of the first French Republic of 1793,\r\nwhich was necessarily forced to fail from its own lack of\r\nclearness--the opposite prejudice prevailed. At that time it was held\r\nas a dogma that all the upper classes were immoral and only the\r\ncommon people were good and moral. This view is due to Rousseau. In\r\nthe new Declaration of Human Rights which the French Convention, that\r\npowerful constitutional assembly, published, it is even set forth in a\r\nspecial article--Article 19--which reads \"_Toute institution, qui ne\r\nsuppose le peuple bon et le magistrat corruptible, est vicieuse_.\"\r\n(Every institution which does not assume that the people is good and\r\nthe magistracy corruptible is faulty.) You see that is exactly the\r\nopposite of the confidence which is called for today, according to\r\nwhich there is no greater crime than to doubt the good-will and the\r\nvirtue of the magistrates, while the people are considered on\r\nprinciple a sort of dangerous beast and centre of corruption.\r\n\r\nAt that time the opposite dogma even went so far that almost anybody\r\nwhose coat was in good repair appeared for that very reason corrupt\r\nand suspicious, and virtue and purity and patriotic morality were\r\nbelieved to be found only in those who had no good coat. It was the\r\nperiod of _sans-culottism._\r\n\r\nThis point of view had really a foundation of truth, which, however,\r\nappears in a false and perverted form. Now there is nothing more\r\ndangerous than a principle which appears in false and perverted form;\r\nfor, whatever attitude you take toward it, you are sure to fare badly.\r\nIf you adopt this truth in its false, perverted form, then, at certain\r\ntimes, this will produce the most terrible devastation, as was the\r\ncase in the period of _sans-culottism._ If, on account of the false\r\nform, you reject the whole proposition as false, you fare still worse,\r\nfor you have rejected a truth, and, in the case which we are\r\nconsidering, a truth without whose recognition no wholesome progress\r\nis possible in modern political affairs.\r\n\r\nThere is therefore no other procedure possible than to overcome the\r\nfalse and perverted form of that proposition, and to try to establish\r\nclearly its true meaning.\r\n\r\nCurrent public opinion is, as I said, disposed to stamp the whole\r\nproposition as entirely false and as a declamation of the French\r\nRevolution and of Rousseau. However, if this unreceptive attitude\r\ntoward Rousseau and the French Revolution were still possible, it\r\nwould be entirely impossible with reference to one of the greatest\r\nGerman philosophers (Fichte), the one hundredth anniversary of whose\r\nbirth this State will celebrate next month, one of the most powerful\r\nthinkers of all nations and all times.\r\n\r\nFichte also declares expressly and literally that, with the rising\r\nsocial scale, a constantly increasing moral deterioration is found,\r\nand that \"inferiority of character increases in proportion to the\r\nhigher social class.\"\r\n\r\nThe final reason of these propositions Fichte has nevertheless not\r\ndeveloped. He gives as the reason of this corruption the selfishness\r\nof the upper classes; but then the question must immediately arise\r\nwhether selfishness is not also to be found in the lower classes, or\r\nwhy less in these classes. Now it must immediately appear as a strong\r\ncontradiction that less selfishness should prevail in the lower\r\nclasses than in the upper, who have in large measure the advantage of\r\nthem in the well-recognized moral elements, culture and education.\r\n\r\nThe real reason, and the explanation of this contradiction, which\r\nappears at first so strong, is the following:\r\n\r\nFor a long time, as we have seen, the development of nations, the\r\ntendency of history, has been toward a constantly extending abolition\r\nof the privileges which guarantee to the higher classes their position\r\nas higher and ruling classes. The wish for perpetuation of these, or\r\npersonal interest, brings therefore every member of the upper classes\r\nwho has not once for all, by a wide outlook upon his whole personal\r\nexistence, raised himself above such considerations (and you will\r\nunderstand, Gentlemen, that these can form only very unusual\r\nexceptions) into a position which is from principle hostile to the\r\nprogress of the people, to the extension of education and science, to\r\nthe advance of culture, to all tendencies and victories of historical\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThis opposition of the personal interest of the upper classes to the\r\nprogress of culture in the nation produces the great and inevitable\r\nimmorality of the upper classes. It is a life whose daily requirements\r\nyou only need picture to yourselves in order to feel the deep decline\r\nof character to which it must lead. To be obliged daily to take an\r\nattitude of opposition to everything great and good, to bewail its\r\nsuccess, to rejoice at its failures, to check its further progress, to\r\nmake futile or to curse the progress which has already been made, is\r\nlike a continual existence in the enemy's country; and this enemy is\r\nthe moral fellowship of the whole country in which you live, for which\r\nall true morality urges support. It is a continual existence, I say,\r\nin an enemy's country. This enemy is your own people, who must be\r\nlooked upon and treated as an enemy, and this hostility must, at least\r\nin the long run, be craftily concealed and more or less artfully\r\nveiled.\r\n\r\nFrom this arises the necessity either of doing what is against the\r\nvoice of your own conscience, or of stifling this voice from the force\r\nof custom in order not to be annoyed by it, or, finally, of never\r\nknowing this voice, never knowing anything better or having anything\r\nbetter than the religion of your own advantage.\r\n\r\nThis life, Gentlemen, therefore leads necessarily to a complete lack\r\nof appreciation and a contempt for all ideal efforts, to a pitying\r\nsmile when the great word \"ideal\" is even mentioned; to a deep lack of\r\nappreciation and of sympathy for everything beautiful and great; to a\r\ncomplete transformation of all moral elements in us into the one\r\npassion of selfish opportunism and the pursuit of pleasure.\r\n\r\nThis conflict between personal interest and the cultural development\r\nof the nation is, fortunately, not to be found in the lower classes of\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nIn the lower classes, to be sure, there is, unfortunately, selfishness\r\nenough, much more than there should be; but this selfishness, if it\r\nexists, is the fault of individuals and not the inevitable fault of\r\nthe class.\r\n\r\nEven a very slight instinct tells the members of the lower classes\r\nthat, so far as each one of them depends merely upon himself and\r\nmerely thinks of himself, he can hope for no considerable improvement\r\nof his situation; but so far as the lower classes of society aim at\r\nthe improvement of their condition as a class, so far does this\r\npersonal interest, instead of opposing the course of history and\r\ntherefore of being condemned to the aforesaid immorality, coincide in\r\nits tendency completely with the development of the people as a whole,\r\nwith the victory of the ideal, with the progress of culture, with the\r\nvital principle of history itself--which is nothing else than the\r\ndevelopment of liberty. Or, as we have already seen, their cause is\r\nthe cause of all humanity.\r\n\r\nYou are therefore in the fortunate position, Gentlemen, instead of\r\nbeing compelled to be dead to the idea, of being destined rather,\r\nthrough your own personal interests, to a greater receptiveness for\r\nit. You are in the fortunate position that that which forms your own\r\ntrue personal interest coincides with the throbbing heart-beat of\r\nhistory--with the active, vital principle of moral development. You\r\ncan therefore devote yourself to historical development with personal\r\npassion and be sure that the more fervent and consuming this passion\r\nis, the more moral is your position, in the true sense which I have\r\nexplained to you.\r\n\r\nThese are the reasons why the control of the fourth class over the\r\nState must produce a fullness of morality and culture and knowledge\r\nsuch as never yet existed in history.\r\n\r\nBut still another reason points in the same direction, which again is\r\nmost intimately connected with all the considerations which we have\r\nstated and forms their keystone.\r\n\r\nThe fourth class has not only a different formal political principle\r\nfrom the capitalist class--namely, the universal direct franchise in\r\nplace of the property qualification of the capitalist class; it has,\r\nfurther, not only through its social position a different relation to\r\nmoral forces than the upper classes, but also, and partly in\r\nconsequence of this, a conception of the moral purpose of the State\r\nentirely different from that of the capitalist class. The moral idea\r\nof the capitalist is this--that nothing whatsoever is to be guaranteed\r\nto any individual but the unimpeded exercise of his faculties.\r\n\r\nIf we were all equally strong, equally wise, equally educated, and\r\nequally rich, this idea might be regarded as a sufficient and a moral\r\none; but since we are not so, and cannot be so, this thought is not\r\nsufficient, and therefore, in its consequences, leads necessarily to a\r\nserious immorality; for its result is that the stronger, abler, richer\r\nman exploits the weaker and becomes his master.\r\n\r\nThe moral idea of the working class, on the other hand, is that the\r\nunimpeded and free exercise of individual faculties by the individual\r\nis not sufficient, but that in a morally adjusted community there must\r\nbe added to it solidarity of interests, mutual consideration, and\r\nmutual helpfulness in development.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to such a condition the capitalist class has this\r\nconception of the moral purposes of the State--that it consists\r\nexclusively and entirely in protecting the personal liberty of the\r\nindividual and his property.\r\n\r\nThis is a policeman's idea, Gentlemen--a policeman's idea because the\r\nState can think of itself only in the guise of a policeman whose whole\r\noffice consists in preventing robbery and burglary. Unfortunately this\r\nconception is to be found, in consequence of imperfect thinking, not\r\nonly among acknowledged liberals, but, often enough, even among many\r\nsupposed to be democrats. If the capitalist class were to carry their\r\nthought to its logical extreme they would have to admit that,\r\naccording to their idea, if there were no thieves or robbers the State\r\nwould be entirely unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe fourth class conceives of the purpose of the State in a quite\r\ndifferent manner, and its conception of it is the true one.\r\n\r\nHistory is a struggle with nature--that is, with misery, with\r\nignorance, with poverty, with weakness, and, accordingly, with\r\nrestrictions of all kinds to which we were subject when the human race\r\nappeared in the beginning of history. A constantly advancing victory\r\nover this weakness--that is the development of liberty which history\r\nportrays.\r\n\r\nIn this struggle we should never have taken a step forward, nor should\r\nwe ever take another, if we had carried it on, or tried to carry it\r\non, as individuals, each for himself alone.\r\n\r\nIt is the State which has the office of perfecting this development of\r\nfreedom, and of the human race to freedom. The State is this unity of\r\nindividuals in a moral composite--a unity which increases a\r\nmillionfold the powers of all individuals who are included in this\r\nunion, which multiplies a millionfold the powers which are at the\r\ncommand of them all as individuals.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the State, then, is not to protect merely the personal\r\nliberty of the individual and the property which, according to the\r\nidea of the capitalist, he must have before he can participate in the\r\nState; the purpose of the State is, rather, through this union to put\r\nindividuals in a position to attain objects, to reach a condition of\r\nexistence which they could never reach as individuals, to empower them\r\nto attain a standard of education, power, and liberty which would be\r\nutterly impossible for them, one and all, merely as individuals. The\r\nobject of the State is, accordingly, to bring the human being to\r\npositive and progressive development--in a word, to shape human\r\ndestiny, i.e., the culture of which mankind is capable, into actual\r\nexistence. It is the training and development of the human race for\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nSuch is the real moral nature of the State--its true and higher task.\r\nThis is so truly the case that for all time it has been carried out\r\nthrough the force of circumstances, by the State, even without its\r\nwill, even without its knowledge, even against the will of its\r\nleaders.\r\n\r\nBut the working class, the lower classes of society in general, have,\r\non account of the helpless position in which their members find\r\nthemselves as individuals, the sure instinct that just this must be\r\nthe function of the State--the aiding of the individual, by the union\r\nof all, to such a development as would be unobtainable by him merely\r\nas an individual.\r\n\r\nThe State then, brought under the control of the idea of the working\r\nclass, would no longer be driven on, as all states have been up to\r\nthis time, unconsciously and often reluctantly, by the nature of\r\nthings and the force of circumstances; but it would make this moral\r\nnature of the State its task, with the greatest clearness and complete\r\nconsciousness. It would accomplish with ready willingness and the most\r\ncomplete consistency that which, up to this time, has been forced only\r\nin the dimmest outlines from the opposing will, and just for this\r\nreason it would necessarily promote a nourishing of intellect, a\r\ndevelopment of happiness, education, prosperity, and liberty, such as\r\nwould stand without example in the world's history, in comparison with\r\nwhich the most lauded conditions in earlier times would drop into a\r\npale shadow.\r\n\r\nIt is this which must be called the political idea of the working\r\nclass, its conception of the purpose of the State, which, as you see,\r\nis just as different, and in a perfectly corresponding manner, from\r\nthe conception of the purpose of the State in the capitalist class as\r\nthe principle of the working class--a share of all in the\r\ndetermination of public policy, or universal suffrage--is from the\r\ncorresponding principle of the capitalist class--the property\r\nqualification.\r\n\r\nThe line of thought here developed is therefore what must be\r\npronounced the idea of the working class. It is that which I had in\r\nview when, at the beginning, I spoke of the connection between the\r\nparticular period of history in which we live and the idea of the\r\nworking class. It is this period, beginning with February, 1848, which\r\nhas the task of bringing such a political idea to realization, and we\r\nmay congratulate ourselves that we have been born in a time which is\r\ndestined to see the accomplishment of this most glorious work of\r\nhistory, and in which we have the privilege of lending a helping hand.\r\n\r\nBut for all who belong to the working class there follows from what I\r\nhave said the duty of an entirely new attitude. Nothing is more\r\neffective in impressing upon a class a dignified and deeply moral\r\nstamp than the consciousness that it is destined to be the ruling\r\nclass; that it is called upon to elevate the principle of its class to\r\nthe principle of the whole historical period; to make its idea the\r\nleading truth of the whole of society, and so, in turn, to shape\r\nsociety into a reflection of its own character. The lofty historical\r\nhonor of this destiny must lay hold upon all your thoughts. It is no\r\nlonger becoming to you to indulge in the vices of the oppressed, or\r\nthe idle distractions of the thoughtless, or even the harmless\r\nfrivolity of the insignificant. You are the rock upon which the church\r\nof the present is to be built.\r\n\r\nThe lofty moral earnestness of this thought should entirely fill your\r\nmind, should fill your hearts and shape your whole life to be worthy\r\nof it and conformable to it. The moral earnestness of this thought,\r\nwithout ever leaving you, must stand for better thoughts in your shop\r\nduring your work, in your leisure hours, your walks, your meetings;\r\nand, even when you lie down to rest on your hard couch, it is this\r\nthought which must fill and occupy your soul until it passes into the\r\nrealm of dreams. The more exclusively you fill your minds with this\r\nmoral earnestness, the more undividedly you are influenced by its\r\nwarmth--of this you may be assured--the more you will hasten the time\r\nin which our present historical period has to accomplish its task, the\r\nsooner you will bring about the fulfilment of this work.\r\n\r\nIf, among those who listen to me today, there were even two or three\r\nin whom I have succeeded in kindling the moral warmth of this thought,\r\nwith that fullness which I mean and which I have described to you, I\r\nshould consider even that a great gain, and account myself richly\r\nrewarded for my presentation.\r\n\r\nAbove all, your soul must be free from discouragement and doubt, to\r\nwhich an insufficiently valid consideration of historical efforts\r\nmight easily lead. So, for instance, it is absolutely false that in\r\nFrance the Republic was overthrown by the _coup d'état_ of December,\r\n1851.\r\n\r\nWhat could not maintain itself in France, what really was destroyed at\r\nthat time, was not _the_ Republic but _that_ republic, which, as I\r\nhave already shown you, abolished, by the law of May 30, 1850, the\r\nuniversal franchise, and introduced a disguised property qualification\r\nfor the exclusion of the workingman. It was the capitalist republic\r\nwhich wished to put the stamp of the _bourgeoisie_--the domination of\r\ncapital--upon the republican forms of the State; it was this which\r\ngave the French usurper the possibility, under an apparent restoration\r\nof the universal franchise, to overthrow the Republic, which otherwise\r\nwould have found an invincible bulwark in the breast of the French\r\nworkingman. So what in France could not maintain itself, and was\r\noverthrown, was not the Republic, but the _bourgeois_ republic; and,\r\non really correct consideration, the fact is confirmed, even by this\r\nexample, that the historical period which began with February, 1848,\r\nwill no longer tolerate any State which, whether in monarchical or in\r\nrepublican form, tries to impress upon it, or maintain within it, the\r\ncontrolling political stamp of the third class of society.\r\n\r\nFrom the lofty mountain tops of science the dawn of a new day is seen\r\nearlier than below in the turmoil of daily life.\r\n\r\nHave you ever beheld a sunrise from the top of a high mountain? A\r\npurple line colors blood-red the farthest horizon, announcing the new\r\nlight. Clouds and mists collect and oppose the morning red, veiling\r\nits beams for a moment; but no power on earth can prevail against the\r\nslow and majestic rising of the sun which, an hour later, visible to\r\nall the world, radiating light and warmth, stands bright in the\r\nfirmament. What an hour is, in the natural phenomena of every day, a\r\ndecade or two is in the still more impressive spectacle of a sunrise\r\nin the world's history.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: The word _bourgeoisie_ is henceforth used throughout the\r\ndiscussion to designate the political party now defined.--TRANSLATOR.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: Here the speaker quotes statistics showing that, on the\r\naverage, throughout Prussia, a vote by a man of the first class has as\r\nmuch weight as seventeen votes by men of the third class.--TRANSLATOR.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCIENCE AND THE WORKINGMEN (1863)\r\n\r\n[A speech delivered by Lassalle in his own defense before the Criminal\r\nCourt of Berlin on the charge of having incited to class hatred.]\r\n\r\nTRANSLATED BY THORSTEIN B. VEBLEN, PH.D. Lecturer in Economics,\r\nUniversity of Missouri\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. President and Gentlemen of the Court:\r\n\r\nI shall have to make my beginning with an appeal to your indulgence.\r\nMy defense will go somewhat into detail. It will, on that account,\r\nnecessarily be somewhat long. But I consider myself justified in\r\npursuing this course, first, by the magnitude of the penalty with\r\nwhich I am threatened under Section 100 of the Criminal Code--the full\r\nextent of this penalty amounting to no less than two years'\r\nimprisonment. In the second place, and more particularly, I consider\r\nmy course justified by the fact that this trial by no means centres\r\nabout a man and the imposition of a penalty.\r\n\r\nYou will, therefore, permit me, without further preliminary, to carry\r\nthe discussion from the region of ordinary court-room routine to that\r\nhigher level on which it properly belongs.\r\n\r\nThe indictment brought against me is an evil and deplorable sign of\r\nthe times. It not only offends the common law, but it is a notable\r\nviolation of the Constitution. This is the first count in the defense\r\nwhich I have to offer.\r\n\r\nI. Article 20 of the Constitution reads: \"Science and its teaching is\r\nfree.\"\r\n\r\nWhat may be the meaning of this phrase in the Constitution, \"is free,\"\r\nunless it means that science and its teaching are not subject to the\r\nordinary provisions of the Criminal Code? Is this expression, \"Science\r\nand its teaching is free,\" perhaps to be taken as meaning \"free within\r\nthe limits of the general provisions of the criminal code?\" But\r\nwithin these limits every expression of opinion is absolutely\r\nfree--not only science and its teaching. So long as they live within\r\nthe general specifications of the criminal code, every newspaper\r\nwriter and every market woman is quite free to write and say whatever\r\nthey choose. This liberty, which is conceded to all expressions of\r\nopinion, need not and could not be proclaimed by a special article of\r\nthe Constitution as a peculiar concession to \"science and its\r\nteaching.\"\r\n\r\nTo put such a construction upon this article of the Constitution\r\namounts to reading it out of the Constitution, to so interpreting it\r\nthat it has nothing to say,--which is in our time by no means a\r\nneglected method of quietly putting the Constitution out of the way.\r\n\r\nNow, the first principle of legal interpretation is that a provision\r\nof law must not be so interpreted as to make it superfluous or absurd,\r\nor to virtually expunge it. This, of course, applies with peculiar\r\nforce to an article of the Constitution. There can accordingly be no\r\ndoubt, Gentlemen, that precisely this was the intention of this\r\nprovision of the Constitution; namely, that the prerogative was to be\r\nconceded to science that it should not lie under the limitations which\r\nthe general criminal code imposes upon every-day, trivial expressions\r\nof opinion.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand that the legislature of any country will seek\r\nto protect the institutions of the country. In the nature of the case,\r\nthe laws forbid inciting the citizens of a country to disorderly\r\noutbreak against the constituted authority.\r\n\r\nIndeed, if we accept certain current views of law and order we have no\r\ndifficulty in understanding that the law may consistently forbid all\r\nsuch appeal to the passions as is designed to foster contempt and\r\ndisregard of existing conventions, or to stir up sentiments of hatred\r\nand distrust in their populace through a direct appeal to the unstable\r\nemotions.\r\n\r\nBut what is in the eternal nature of things free, on which no limits\r\nmust be imposed, the importance of which to the State itself is\r\ngreater than that of any single provision of law, to the free exercise\r\nof which no provision of law can set bounds--that is the impulse to\r\nscientific investigation.\r\n\r\nNo situation and no institution is perfect. Such a thing may happen as\r\nthat an institution which we are accustomed to consider the most\r\nunimpeachable and indispensable, may, in fact, be vicious in the\r\nhighest degree, and be most seriously in need of reform.\r\n\r\nWill any one deny this whose view comprehends the changes which\r\nhistory records since the days of the Hindus or the Egyptians? Or even\r\nif he looks no further than the narrow space of the past one hundred\r\nyears?\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian fellah warms the hearth of his squalid mud hut with the\r\nmummies of the Pharaohs of Egypt, the all-powerful builders of the\r\neverlasting pyramids. Customs, conventions, codes, dynasties, states,\r\nnations come and go in incontinent succession. But, stronger than\r\nthese, never disappearing, forever growing, from the earliest\r\nbeginnings of the Ionic philosophy, unfolding in an ever-increasing\r\namplitude, outleaping all else, spreading from one nation and from one\r\npeople to another, and handed down, with devout reverence, from age to\r\nage, there remains the stately growth of scientific knowledge.\r\n\r\nAnd what is the source of all that unremitting progress, of all that\r\nuninterruptedly, but insensibly, broadening amelioration which we see\r\npeacefully accomplishing itself in the course of history, if it is not\r\nthis same scientific knowledge? And, this being so, science must have\r\nits way without restraint; for science there is nothing fixed and\r\ndefinite, to which its process of chemical analysis may not be\r\napplied, nothing sacred, no _noli me tangere_. Without free scientific\r\ninquiry, therefore, there is no outcome but stagnation, decline and\r\nbarbarism. And, while free scientific inquiry is the perennial\r\nfountain-head of all progress in human affairs, this inquiry and its\r\ngradually extending sway over men's convictions, is at the same time\r\nthe only guarantee of a peaceable advance. Whoever stops up this\r\nfountain, whoever attempts to prevent its flowing at any point, or to\r\nrestrain its bearing upon any given situation, is not only guilty of\r\ncutting off the sources of progress, but he is guilty of a breach of\r\nthe public peace and of endangering the stability of the State. It is\r\nthrough the means of such scientific inquiry and its work of\r\npainstaking elaboration that the exigencies of a progressively\r\nchanging situation are enabled gradually, and without harm, to have\r\ntheir effect upon men's thinking and upon human relations, and so to\r\npass into the life of society. Whoever obstructs scientific inquiry\r\nclamps down the safety valve of public opinion, and puts the State in\r\ntrain for an explosion. He prohibits science from finding out the\r\nmalady and its remedy, and he thereby substitutes the resulting\r\nconvulsions of the death struggle for a diagnosis and a judicious\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nUnrestrained freedom of scientific teaching is, accordingly, not only\r\nan inalienable right of the individual, but, what is more to the\r\npoint, it is, primarily and most particularly, a necessity of life to\r\nthe community; it involves the life of the State itself.\r\n\r\nTherefore has society formulated the provision that \"Science and its\r\nteaching is free,\" without qualification, without condition, without\r\nlimits; and this proviso is incorporated into the Constitution, in\r\norder to make it plain that it must remain inviolate even at the hands\r\nof the law-giver himself, that even he must not for a moment overlook\r\nor disregard it. And so it serves as pledge of the continual peaceable\r\ndevelopment of social life down to the remotest generations.\r\n\r\nDoes a question present itself at this point, Gentlemen? Am I setting\r\nup a new and unheard-of theory on this head?\r\n\r\nAm I, possibly, misconstruing the wording of the Constitution in order\r\nto extricate myself from an embarrassing criminal process?\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, nothing is easier than to prove to you from the\r\nevidences of history that this provision of the Constitution has never\r\nbeen taken in any other sense; that for long centuries before the days\r\nof the Constitution this theory has been current among us in usage\r\nand practice; that it is by ancient tradition a characteristic feature\r\nof the culture of all Germanic peoples.\r\n\r\nIn the days of Socrates, it was still possible to be indicted for\r\nhaving taught new gods (Greek: katnos theous), and Socrates drank\r\nthe hemlock under such an indictment.\r\n\r\nIn antiquity all this was natural enough. The genius of antiquity was\r\nso utterly identified with the conditions of its political life, and\r\nreligion was so integral an element in the foundations of the ancient\r\nState, that the ancient mind was quite incapable of divesting itself\r\nof these convictions, and so getting out of its integument. The spirit\r\nof antiquity must stand or fall with its particular political\r\nconventions, and, in the event, it fell with them.\r\n\r\nSuch being the spirit of those times, it follows that any scientific\r\ndoctrine which carried a denial of any element of the foundations of\r\nthe State was in effect an attack upon the nation's life and must\r\nnecessarily be dealt with as such.\r\n\r\nAll this changes when the ancient world passes away and the Germanic\r\npeoples come upon the scene. These latter are peoples gifted with a\r\ncapacity to change their integument. By virtue of that faculty for\r\ndevelopment that belongs to the guiding principle of their life, viz.:\r\nthe principle of the subjective spirit,--by virtue of this, these\r\nlatter are possessed of a flexibility which enables them to live\r\nthrough the most widely varied metamorphoses. These peoples have\r\npassed through many and extreme transformations, and, instead of\r\nmeeting their death and dissolution in the process, they have by force\r\nof it ever emerged on a higher plane of development and into a richer\r\nunfolding of life.[49]\r\n\r\nThe means by which these peoples are able to prepare the way for and\r\nto achieve these transmutations through which they constantly emerge\r\nto that fuller life, the rudiments of which are inborn in them, is the\r\nprinciple of an unrestrained freedom of scientific research and\r\nteaching.\r\n\r\nHence it comes that this instinct of free thought among these peoples\r\nreaches expression very early, much earlier than the modern learned\r\nworld commonly suspects. \"We are mistakenly in the habit of thinking\r\nof free scientific inquiry as a fruitage of modern times. But among\r\nthese peoples that instinct is an ancient one which asserts that free\r\ninquiry must be bound neither by the authority of a person nor by a\r\nhuman ordinance; that, on the contrary, it is a power in itself,\r\nresting immediately upon its own divine right, superior to and\r\nantedating all human institutions whatever.\r\n\r\n\"_Quasi lignum vitae_,\" says Pope Alexander IV. in a constitution\r\naddressed to the University of Paris in 1256, \"_Quasi lignum vitae in\r\nParadiso Dei, et quasi lucerna fulgoris in Domo Domini, est in Sancta\r\nEcclesia Parisiensis Studii disciplina_.\" \"As the tree of life in God's\r\nParadise and the lamp of glory in the house of God, such in the Holy\r\nChurch is the place of the Parisian corporation of learning.\" To\r\nappreciate the import of these words of the holy father, it should be\r\nborne in mind that in the Middle Ages all things whatever lived only by\r\nvirtue of a corporate existence, so that learning existed only as\r\nincorporated in a university.\r\n\r\nIt would be a serious mistake to believe that the universities of the\r\nMiddle Ages rested that prerogative of scientific censure--_censura\r\ndoctrinatis_--to which they laid claim in such a comprehensive way,\r\nupon these and other like papal or imperial and royal decrees of\r\nestablishment. Petrus Alliacensis, a man whom the University of Paris\r\nelected as its _magnus magister_ in 1381, and who afterward wore the\r\narchiepiscopal and also the cardinal's hat, tells us that not _ex jure\r\nhumano_, not from human legislation, but _ex jure divino_, from divine\r\nlaw, does science derive its competence to exercise the _censura_; and\r\nthe privileges and charters granted by popes, emperors and kings are\r\nnothing more than the acts of recognition of this prerogative of\r\nscience that comes to it _ex jure divino_, or, as an alternative\r\nexpression has it, _ex jure naturali_, by the law of nature. And in\r\nthis, Petrus Alliacensis is substantially borne out by all the later\r\nscholastics.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, we are in the habit of giving ourselves airs and of looking\r\ndown on the Middle Ages as a time of darkness and barbarism. But in so\r\ndoing we are frequently in the wrong, and in no respect are we more\r\nthoroughly in the wrong than in passing such an opinion upon the\r\nposition of science in the Middle Ages. Frequent and most solemn are\r\nthe cases in which recognition is made of the right of science to\r\nraise her voice without all regard to king and pope, and even against\r\nking and pope.\r\n\r\nWe have recently witnessed a conflict between the government and the\r\nhouse of deputies as to the meeting of expenditures not granted by the\r\nhouse. An impression has been diligently spread abroad through the\r\ncountry that this is an unheard of piece of boldness and a subversive\r\nassumption of power on the part of the house of deputies, and indeed\r\nthere have not been wanting deputies who have been astonished at\r\ntheir own daring, and have taken some pride in it.\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, Gentlemen, in February, 1412, the University\r\nof Paris, which was in no way intrusted with an oversight or a control\r\nof this country's fiscal affairs, took occasion to address a memorial\r\nto the King of France, Charles VI., as it said: \"_pour la chose\r\npublique du votre royaume_\"--on the public concerns of the realm. And\r\nin this memorial the university subjects the fiscal administration of\r\nthe country, together with other branches of the administration, to a\r\ndrastic criticism, and passes a verdict of unqualified condemnation\r\nupon it. This _rémonstrance_ of the University of Paris rises to a\r\ndegree of boldness, both in its demands and in its tone, that is quite\r\nforeign to anything which our house of deputies has done or might be\r\nexpected to do. It points out that the revenues have not been expended\r\nfor the purposes for which they were levied--\"_on appert clairement,\r\nque les dictes finances ne sont point employées à choses dessus\r\ndictes_,\" etc.--and it closes this its review with the peremptory\r\ndemand: \"_Item, et il fault savoir, où est cette finance,\"--\"Now, we\r\nhave a right to know what has become of these funds.\" It describes the\r\nking's fiscal administration, including the highest officials, the\r\nfinance ministers, gouverneurs and treasurers, as a gang of lawless\r\nmiscreants, a band of rogues conspiring together for the ruin of the\r\ncountry. It upbraids the king himself with having packed the\r\nparliament of Paris, and so having corrupted the administration of\r\njustice. It points out to him that his predecessors carried on the\r\ngovernment by means of much smaller revenues: \"_au quel temps estoit\r\nle royaume bien gouverné, autrement que maintenant_\"--\"when the\r\ncountry was well governed, as is not the case today.\" The\r\n_rémonstrance_ goes on to picture the burdens which rest upon the\r\npoor, and to demand that these burdens be lightened by means of a\r\nforced loan levied upon the rich. And the _rémonstrance_ closes with\r\nthe declaration that all this, which it has set forth is, in spite of\r\nits length, but a very adequate presentation of the matter, in so\r\nmuch that it would require several days to describe all the\r\nmisgovernment the country suffered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE IRON FOUNDRY _From the Painting by Adolph von\r\nMenzel_]\r\n\r\nThe university rests its right to make such a _rémonstrance_ upon this\r\nground alone,--that it is the spokesman of science, of which all men\r\nknow that it is without selfish interest, that there are neither\r\npublic offices nor emoluments in its keeping, and that it is not\r\nconcerned with these matters in any connection but that of their\r\ninvestigation; but precisely for this reason, it is incumbent upon\r\nscience to speak out openly when the case demands it.\r\n\r\nAnd the conclusion to which it comes is of no less serious import than\r\nthis: It is the king's duty, without all delay (_sans quelque\r\ndilacion_) to dismiss all comptrollers (_gouverneurs)_ of finance from\r\noffice, without exception (_sans nul excepter_), to apprehend their\r\npersons and provisionally to sequestrate their goods, and, under\r\npenalty of death and confiscation of property, to forbid all\r\ncommunication between the lower officials of the fisc and these\r\ncomptrollers.\r\n\r\nIf you will read this voluminous _rémonstrance_, Gentlemen--you may\r\nfind it in the annals of that time by Enguerrand de Monstrelet (liv.\r\nI. c. 99, Tom. II. p. 307 _et seq_., ed. Douët d'Aroy)--you cannot\r\navoid seeing that, had this memorial been promulgated in our time,\r\ne.g., by the University of Berlin, there is scarce an offense\r\nenumerated in the code but would have been found in it by the public\r\nprosecutor. Defamation and insult of officials in the execution of\r\ntheir office, contempt and abuse of the government's regulations and\r\nthe disposition taken by the officials, lèse majesté, incitement of\r\nthe subjects of the State to hatred and disrespect--and, indeed, I\r\nknow not what all would be the offenses which our prosecutors would\r\nhave discovered in the document. It is less than a year since,\r\naccording to the newspapers, a disciplinary inquiry was instituted\r\nwith respect to a memorial of a very different tenor, wherein one of\r\nour universities declined the mandatory suggestions addressed to the\r\nuniversity by the ministers in regard to a given appointment. But,\r\nat that earlier day, in the dark ages, such was not the custom. On the\r\nother hand, in compliance with the university's demands, the treasurer\r\nof the crown, Audry Griffart, together with many others of the high\r\nofficers of finance, was taken into custody, while others avoided a\r\nlike fate only by escaping into a church vested with the right of\r\nasylum.\r\n\r\nThat was in 1412. But already eighty years before that date there\r\noccurred another, and perhaps even more significant case, which I may\r\ntouch upon more briefly. Pope John XXII. promulgated a new\r\nconstruction of the dogma of _visio beatifica_ and had it preached in\r\nthe churches. The University of Paris,--_nec pontificis reverentia\r\nprohibuit_, says the report, _quominus veritati insistereat_,--\"reverence\r\nof the holy father prevented not the university from declaring the\r\ntruth\"--, although the matter then in question was an article of the\r\nfaith and lay within a field within which the competence of the pope\r\ncould not be doubted, still the university, on the 22d of January, 1332,\r\nput forth a decree in which this construction of the dogma was classed\r\nto be erroneous.\r\n\r\nPhilip VI. served this decree upon the pope, then resident at Avignon,\r\nwith the declaration that, unless he recanted as the decree required,\r\nhe would have him burned as a heretic. And the pope, in fact,\r\nrecanted, although he was then on his deathbed. All of which you may\r\nfind set forth in Bulas, _Historia Universitatis Parisiensis_. (Paris,\r\n1668, fol. Tom. IV. p. 375 _et seq_.)\r\n\r\nThese instances, which might be multiplied at will, may suffice to\r\nshow how unqualified was the freedom of science even in early days,\r\nconstrained by no punitive limitation at the hands of pope or king;\r\nfor, be it remembered, in the Middle Ages, science had, as I have\r\nbefore remarked, only a corporate existence in its bearers, the\r\nuniversities. So that the view for which I speak has practically been\r\naccepted as much as five hundred years back, even in Catholic times\r\nand among Latin peoples.\r\n\r\nBut now comes Protestantism and creates its political structure,\r\nwhich it erects on precisely this broad principle of free thought and\r\nfree research. This principle has since that epoch been the foundation\r\nupon which our entire political life has rested. A protestant State\r\nhas no other claim to existence than precisely this--cannot possibly\r\nexist on other ground. When has there, since that time, been talk of a\r\npenal prosecution in Prussia on account of a scientific doctrine?\r\n\r\nChristian Wolf, at Halle, popularized the Leibnizian philosophy, and\r\nit was then brought to the notice of the soldier-king, Frederick\r\nWilliam I., that, according to Wolf's teaching of preëstablished\r\nharmony, deserting soldiers did not desert by their own free will but\r\nby force of this peculiar divine arrangement of a preëstablished\r\nharmony;[50] wherefore this doctrine, being spread abroad among the\r\nmilitary, could not but be very detrimental to the maintenance of\r\nmilitary discipline. It is true, this soldier-king, whose regiments\r\nwere his State, was incensed at all this in the highest degree, and\r\nthat he forthwith, in November, 1723, issued an order-in-council\r\nagainst Wolf, ordering him on penalty of the halter, to leave Prussian\r\nground within twice twenty-four hours--and Wolf was obliged to flee.\r\nBut, inasmuch as the king's _lettres de cachet_ in that time permitted\r\nno appeal, they are also passed over in history as being devoid of\r\ninterest or historic significance. It may be added that the\r\nsoldier-king had simply perpetrated a gratuitous outrage, and had not\r\nset the claims of law and right aside. He threatened to hang Wolf, and\r\nthis threat he could have carried out with the help of his soldiers.\r\nEven brute force is not devoid of dignity when it acts openly and\r\nabove-board. He did not insult his courts by asking them to condemn\r\nscientific teaching. It did not occur to him to disguise his act of\r\nviolence under the forms of law.\r\n\r\nMoreover, no sooner had Frederick the Great ascended the throne, 31st\r\nof May, 1740, than he, six days later, 6th of June, 1740, sent a note\r\nto the Councillor of the Consistory, Reinbeck, directing the recall of\r\nWolf. Even Frederick William I. had repented of his violence against\r\nWolf and had in vain, in the most honorable terms, addressed letters\r\nof recall to him. But Frederick the Great, while he too had use for\r\nsoldiers, was no soldier-king, but a statesman. The note to Reinbeck\r\nruns: \"You are requested to use your best endeavor with respect to\r\nthis Wolf, who is a person that seeks and loves the truth, who is to\r\nbe held in high honor among all men, and I believe you will have\r\nachieved a veritable conquest in the realm of truth if you persuade\r\nWolf to return to us.\"\r\n\r\nSo it appears, then, that also this conflict serves only to add force\r\nto the ancient principle that scientific research and the presentation\r\nof scientific truth is not to be bound by any limitations or by any\r\nconsiderations of expediency, and must find its sole and all\r\nsufficient justification in itself alone. This principle hereby\r\nachieved a new lustre and gained the full authentication of the crown.\r\n\r\nEven the existence of God was not shielded from the discussion of\r\nscience. Science was allowed, as it is still allowed, to put forth its\r\nproofs against his existence. The provisions of the new penal code\r\nbear only upon blasphemous utterances, such revilings of God as may\r\noffend those who believe otherwise, not upon the denial of his\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nFor many decades before the days of the Constitution the\r\nunquestioned liberty of science on Prussian ground had served the\r\nantagonists of Prussia as their supreme recourse, their chief\r\nboast and proudest ornament. You will remember the extraordinary\r\nsensation created by the case of Bruno Bauer, the Privat Docent\r\non the theological faculty at Bonn, whom it was attempted to\r\ndeprive of his _licentia docendi_[51] at the ominous instance of\r\nthe absolutist-pietistical Eichhorn ministry, because of his\r\npeculiar doctrine concerning the gospel. This was the first case\r\nduring the present century in which an assault has been attempted\r\nupon the freedom of scientific teaching, and even this was an\r\ninfinitely less heinous one than the present. The faculties of\r\nthe university were deeply stirred, and for months together\r\nofficial pronunciamentos swarmed about the town; men of the\r\nhighest standing, such as Marheinecke and others, declared that\r\nprotestantism and enlightenment were threatened in their very\r\nfoundations in case such usurpation, hitherto unheard of in\r\nPrussia, were allowed to take its course. And even such\r\nexpressions of opinion as reached a conclusion subservient to the\r\nministerial view based their conclusion on the ground that\r\nthe case in question concerned a _licentia docendi_ in the\r\ntheological faculty, with the fundamental principles of which\r\nBauer's doctrines were incompatible. They took care expressly to\r\ndeclare that had the question concerned a _licentia docendi_ in\r\nany one of the nontheological faculties, in a philosophical\r\nfaculty, e.g., the decision must necessarily have been reversed.\r\nNo one, not even Eichhorn himself, harbored the conceit that this\r\ndoctrine and its teaching was to be dealt with by the criminal\r\ncourt. A teacher who spread abroad scientific teachings\r\nsubversive of theological doctrines was deprived of the\r\nopportunity to proclaim his teaching from a theological chair;\r\nbut to call in the jailer to suppress him--to that depth of\r\nsubservience to absolutism had no one at that time descended.\r\nAlas, that Eichhorn, the much berated, could not have lived to\r\nsee this day! With what admiration and with what gratification\r\nwould he have looked upon his \"constitutional\" successors!\r\n\r\nEven in the days of Eichhorn's pietistical absolutism, with its\r\n_ecclesia militans_ of obscurantism, there survived so much of a sense\r\nof decency regarding the ancient traditions as to exempt the liberty\r\nof scientific teaching from the indignity of that preventive censure\r\nwhich in those days rendered repressive legislation superfluous. In\r\ntheir search for some tenable and tangible criterion of the scientific\r\n character of any publication, the men of that time, it is true, hit\r\nupon a somewhat absurd one in making the test a test of bulk--books of\r\nmore than twenty forms were exempt from censure. But however awkward\r\nthe outcome, the aim of the provision is not to be denied.\r\n\r\nThese ancient traditions, with more than five hundred years of\r\nprescriptive standing; this principle which prevailed by usage and\r\nacceptance among all modern peoples long before it was embodied in\r\nlegal form; this primordial deliverance of the spiritual life of the\r\nGermanic nations is the substantial fact which our modern society has\r\nnow finally embodied in Article 20 of the Constitution and so has\r\nconstituted a norm for the guidance of all later law-givers, in other\r\nwords: \"Science and its teaching is free.\"\r\n\r\nIt is free without qualification, without limits, without bolts and\r\nbars. Under established law everything has its limitations,--every\r\npower, every function, every vested authority. The only thing which\r\nremains without bounds or constituted limitation, whose privilege it\r\nis to over-spread and to overlie all established facts, in such\r\nboundless and unhindered freedom as the sun and the air, is the\r\nirradiating force of theoretical research.\r\n\r\nScientific theory must be free even to the length of license.\r\nFor, even if we could speak of a license in science and its\r\nteaching,--which, by the way, is most seriously to be\r\nquestioned,--this is by all means a point at which an attempt to guard\r\nagainst abuse in one case would be liable in a million instances to\r\nput a check upon the blessings of rightful use. If any given measures\r\nof state, or any given class institutions, were shielded from\r\nscientific discussion, so that science might not teach that the\r\narrangements in question are inadequate or detrimental, iniquitous or\r\ndestructive,--under these circumstances, what genius could there be of\r\nsuch comprehensive reach, so far overtopping the spiritual level of\r\nall his contemporaries and all succeeding generations, as even to\r\nsurmise the total extent of the loss which would thereby be sustained?\r\nWhat fruitful discoveries and developments, what growth of spiritual\r\npower and insight would be stifled in the germ by one such rigid\r\ninterdict upon abuse; and what violent convulsions and what decay\r\nmight not come upon the State in consequence of it?\r\n\r\nThe question is also fairly to be asked: what is legitimate use and\r\nwhat is abuse of science? Where lies the line between them, and who\r\ndetermines it? This discretion would have to lie, not with a court of\r\nlaw, but with a court made up of the flower of scientific talent of\r\nthe time, in all departments and branches of science.\r\n\r\nHowever enlightened your honorable body may be--and indeed the more\r\nenlightened the more unavoidably--this proposition must appeal to you\r\nas beyond question. What am I saying? The flower of the scientific\r\ntalent of the time? No; that would not answer. The scientific genius\r\nof all subsequent time would have to be included; for how often does\r\nhistory show us the pioneers of science in sheer contradiction with\r\nthe accepted body of scientific knowledge of their own time! It may\r\ntake fifty, and it may often take a hundred years of discussion in\r\nscientific matters to settle the question as to what is true and\r\nlegitimate and what is abuse.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, there has hitherto been not an attempt, since the\r\nadoption of the constitution, to bring an indictment against any given\r\nscientific teaching.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, since 1848--since 1830--we have here in Prussia had many a\r\nsore and heavy burden to bear, and our shoulders are lame and tired\r\nwith the bearing of them. But even under the Manteuffel-Westphalen\r\nadministration, and until today, we have been spared this one\r\nindignity, of being called upon to see a scientific doctrine cited\r\nbefore the court.\r\n\r\nThe keenest attacks, attacks which, taken by themselves, might easily\r\nhave been subject to criminal prosecution, have suffered no\r\nprosecution in any case where they have been embodied in a scientific\r\nwork and when promulgated in the form of a scientific doctrine.\r\n\r\nI am myself in a position to testify on this point. It is not quite\r\ntwo years since I published a work in which, I believe, I have\r\nsucceeded in contributing something to the advancement of your own\r\nscience, Gentlemen,--the science on which the administration of\r\njustice is based. The work of which I speak is my \"System of Acquired\r\nRights.\" _(System der erworbenen Rechte.)_ In this work I take\r\noccasion to say (Vol. I., p. 238): \"Science, whose first duty is the\r\nmost searching inquiry and concise thinking, can on this account in no\r\nway deprive itself of the right to formulate its conceptions with all\r\nthe definiteness and concision which the clearness of these\r\nconceptions itself requires.\" And proceeding on this ground I go on,\r\nin the further discussion, to show that the agrarian legislation of\r\nPrussia subsequent to 1850 is nothing else--to quote my own words\r\nliterally--than a robbery of the poor for the benefit of the wealthy\r\nlanded aristocracy, illegal and perpetrated in violation of the\r\nperpetrators' own sense of equity.\r\n\r\nHow easy would it not have been, if the expressions had occurred\r\nelsewhere than in a scientific treatise, to find that they embodied\r\novert contempt of the institutions of the State, and incitement to\r\nhatred and disregard of the regulations of the government. But they\r\noccurred in a scientific treatise--they were the outcome of a\r\npainstaking scientific inquiry,--therefore they passed without\r\nindictment.\r\n\r\nBut that was two years ago.\r\n\r\nIn return for the accusation which has been brought against me, I, in\r\nmy turn, retort with the accusation that my accusers have this day\r\nbrought upon Prussia the disgrace that now for the first time since\r\nthe State came into existence scientific teaching is prosecuted before\r\na criminal court. For what can the public prosecutor say to my\r\naccusation, since he concedes the substance of my claims, since he is\r\ncompelled to acknowledge that science and its teaching is free, and\r\ntherefore free from all penal restraint? Will he contend, perhaps,\r\nthat I do not represent science? Or will he, possibly, deny that the\r\nwork with which this indictment is concerned is a scientific work?\r\nThe prosecutor seems to feel himself hampered by the fact that he has\r\nhere to do with a scientific production, for he begins his indictment\r\nwith the sentence: \"While the accused has assumed an appearance of\r\nscientific inquiry, his discussion at all points is of a practical\r\nbearing.\" The appearance of scientific inquiry? And why is it the\r\nappearance only? I call upon the prosecutor to show why only the\r\nappearance of scientific inquiry is to be imputed to this scientific\r\npublication. I believe that in a question as to what is scientific and\r\nwhat not, I am more competent to speak than the public prosecutor.\r\n\r\nIn various and difficult fields of science I have published voluminous\r\nworks; I have spared no pains and no midnight vigils in the endeavor\r\nto widen the scope of science itself, and, I believe, I can in this\r\nmatter say with Horace: _Militavi non sine gloria_.[52] But I declare\r\nto you: Never, not in the most voluminous of my works, have I written\r\na line that was more carefully thought out in strict conformity to\r\nscientific truth than this production is from its first page to its\r\nlast. And I assert further that not only is this brochure a scientific\r\nwork, as so many another may be that presents in combination results\r\nalready known, but that it is in many respects a scientific\r\nachievement, a development of new scientific conceptions.\r\n\r\nWhat is the criterion by which the scientific standing of a book is to\r\nbe judged? None else, of course, than its contents.\r\n\r\nI beg you, therefore, to take a look at the contents of this pamphlet.\r\nIts content is nothing else than a philosophy of history, condensed in\r\nthe compass of forty-four pages, beginning with the Middle Ages and\r\ncoming down to the present. It is a development of that objective\r\nunfolding of rational thought which has lain at the root of European\r\nhistory for more than a thousand years past; it is an exposition of that\r\ninner soul of things resident in the process of history that manifests\r\nitself in the apparently opaque, empirical sequence of events and which\r\nhas produced this historical sequence out of its own moving, creative\r\nforce. It is, in spite of the brief compass of the pamphlet, the\r\nstrictly developed proof that history is nothing else than the\r\nself-accomplishing, by inner necessity increasingly progressive\r\nunfolding of reason and of freedom, achieving itself under the mask of\r\napparently mere external and material relations.\r\n\r\nIn the brief compass of this pamphlet, I pass three great periods of\r\nthe world's history in review before the reader; and for each one I\r\npoint out that it proceeds on a single comprehensive idea, which\r\ncontrols all the various, apparently unrelated, fields of development\r\nand all the different and widely-scattered phenomena that fall within\r\nthe period in question; and I show that each of these periods is but\r\nthe necessary forerunner and preparation for the succeeding period,\r\nand that each succeeding period is the peculiar and imminently\r\nnecessary continuation, the consequence and unavoidable consummation\r\nof the preceding period, and that these together, consequently,\r\nconstitute a comprehensive and logically inseparable whole.\r\n\r\nFirst comes the period of feudalism. I here show that feudalism, in\r\nall its variations, rests on the one principle of control of landed\r\nproperty, and I also show how at that time, owing to the fact that\r\nsociety's productive work to a preponderating extent consisted in\r\nagriculture, landed property necessarily was the controlling factor,\r\nthat is to say, the feature conditioning all political and social\r\npower and standing.\r\n\r\nAnd I beg you, Gentlemen, to take note with what a strict scientific\r\nobjectivity of treatment, how free from all propagandist bias, I\r\nproceed with the discussion. If there is any one datum which lends\r\nitself to the purposes of that propagandist bias which the public\r\nprosecutor claims to find in this pamphlet--namely the incitement of\r\nthe indigent classes to hatred of the wealthy--it is the peasant wars.\r\nIf there is any one fact which has hitherto been accepted, in\r\nscientific and in popular opinion alike, and more particularly among\r\nthe unpropertied classes, with, the fondest remembrance, as a national\r\nmovement iniquitously put down by the strong hand of violence, it is\r\nthe peasant wars.\r\n\r\nNow, unmoved by this predilection and this shimmer of sentiment, with\r\nwhich the science and the popular sense have united in investing the\r\npeasant wars, I go on to divest these wars of this deceptive\r\nappearance and show them up in their true light,--that they were at\r\nbottom a reactionary movement, which, fortunately for the cause of\r\nliberty, was of necessity doomed to failure.\r\n\r\nFurther: If there exists in Germany an institution which, as a\r\nquestion of our own times, I abominate with all my heart as the source\r\nof our national decay, our shame and our impotence, it is the\r\ninstitution of the territorial State.\r\n\r\nNow, the pamphlet in question is so strictly scientific and objective\r\nin its method, so far removed from all personal bias, that I therein\r\ngo on to show that the institution of the territorial State was, in\r\nits time, historically a legitimate and revolutionary feature; that it\r\nwas an ideal advance, in that it embodied and developed the concept of\r\na State independent of relations of ownership; whereas the peasant\r\nwars sought to place the State, and all political power and standing,\r\non the basis of property.\r\n\r\nI then, further, go on to show how the period of feudalism is\r\nsucceeded by a second world-historic period. I show how, while the\r\npeasant wars were revolutionary only in their own delusion, there\r\nbegins almost simultaneously with them a real revolution, namely, that\r\naccumulation of capitalistic wealth which arose through the\r\ndevelopment of industry. This wrought a thoroughgoing change in the\r\nwhole situation,--a change which reached its final act, achieved its\r\nlegal acceptance, in the French Revolution of 1789, but which had in\r\npoint of fact for three hundred years been imperceptibly advancing\r\ntoward its consummation.\r\n\r\nI show in detail, which I need not here expound or recapitulate, what\r\nare the economic factors that were destined to push landed property\r\ninto the remotest back-ground and leave it relatively powerless,\r\nby making the new industrial activity the great lever and the bearer\r\nof modern social wealth. All this took place by force of the new\r\nindustrial activity the great lever and the bearer of methods which\r\nthey brought in.\r\n\r\nI show how this capitalized wealth, which has come forward as an\r\noutcome of this industrial development and has grown to be the\r\ndominant factor in this second period, must in its turn attain the\r\nposition of prerogative as the recognized qualification of political\r\ncompetence, as the condition of a voice in the councils and policy of\r\nthe State; just as was at an earlier time the case with landed\r\nproperty in relation to the public law of feudalism. I show how,\r\ndirectly and indirectly in the control of opinion, in the requirement\r\nof bonds and stamp duties, in the public press, in the growth of\r\nindividual taxation, etc., capitalized wealth, as a basis of\r\nparticipation in public affairs, must work out its inherent tendency\r\nwith the same thoroughness and the same historical necessity as landed\r\nproperty had done in its time.\r\n\r\nAnd this second period, which has completed its three hundred and\r\nfifty years, as I further go on to show, is now essentially concluded.\r\nWith the French Revolution of 1848 comes the dawning of a new, a third\r\nhistorical period. By its proclamation of universal and equal\r\nsuffrage, regardless of property qualifications, this third period\r\nassigns to each and every one an equal share in the sovereignty, in\r\nthe guidance of public affairs and public policy. And so it installs\r\nfree labor as the dominating principle of social life, conditioned by\r\nneither the possession of land nor of capital.\r\n\r\nI then develop the difference in point of ethical principles between\r\nthe _bourgeoisie_ and the laboring class, as well as the resulting\r\ndifference in the political ideals of the two classes. The\r\naristocratic principle assigned the individual his status on the basis\r\nof descent and social rank, whereas the principal for which the\r\n_bourgeoisie_ stands contends that all such legal restriction is\r\niniquitous, and that the individual must be counted simply as such,\r\nwith no prerogative beyond guaranteeing him the unhindered\r\nopportunity to make the most of his capacities as an individual. Now,\r\nI claim, if we all were by native gift equally wealthy, equally\r\ncapable, equally well educated, then this principle of equal\r\nopportunity would be adequate to the purpose. But since such equality\r\ndoes not prevail, and indeed cannot come to pass, and since we do not\r\ncome into the world simply as undifferentiated individuals, but\r\nendowed in varying degree with wealth and capacities, which in turn\r\nresult in differences of education; therefore, this principle is not\r\nan adequate principle. For, if under these actual circumstances,\r\nnothing were guaranteed beyond the unhindered opportunity of the\r\nindividual to make the most of himself, the consequence must be an\r\nexploitation of the weaker by the stronger. The principle for which\r\nthe working classes stand is this, that free opportunity alone will\r\nnot suffice, but that to this, for the purposes of any morally\r\ndefensible organization of society, there must be added the further\r\nprinciple of a solidarity of interests, a community and mutuality in\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nFrom this difference between the two classes, in point of ethical\r\nprinciple, follows, as a matter of course, the difference in political\r\nideals.\r\n\r\nThe _bourgeoisie_ has elaborated the principle that the end of the\r\nState is to protect the personal liberty of the individual and his\r\nproperty. This is the doctrine put forth by the scientific spokesmen\r\nof the _bourgeoisie_. This is the doctrine of its political leaders,\r\nof liberalism. But this theory is in a high degree inadequate,\r\nunscientific, and at variance with the essential nature of the State.\r\n\r\nThe course of history is a struggle against nature, against need,\r\nignorance and impotence, and, therefore, against bondage of every kind\r\nin which we were held under the state of nature at the beginning of\r\nhistory. The progressive overcoming of this impotence,--this is the\r\nevolution of liberty, whereof history is an account. In this struggle\r\nwe should never have made one step in advance, and we should never\r\ntake a further step, if we had gone into the struggle singly, each for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nNow the State is precisely this contemplated unity and coöperation of\r\nindividuals in a moral whole, whose function it is to carry on this\r\nstruggle, a combination which multiplies a million fold the force of\r\nall the individuals comprised in it, which heightens a million fold\r\nthe powers which each individual singly would be able to exert.\r\n\r\nThe end of the State, therefore, is not simply to secure to each\r\nindividual that personal freedom and that property with which the\r\nbourgeois principle assumes that the individual enters the state\r\norganization at the outset, but which in point of fact are first\r\nafforded him in and by the State. On the contrary, the end of the\r\nState can be no other than to accomplish that which, in the nature of\r\nthings, is and always has been the function of the State,--in set\r\nterms: by combining individuals into a state organization to enable\r\nthem to achieve such ends and to attain such a level of existence as\r\nthey could not achieve as isolated individuals.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate and intrinsic end of the State, therefore, is to further\r\nthe positive unfolding, the progressive development of human life. In\r\nother words, its function is to work out in actual achievement the\r\ntrue end of man; that is to say, the full degree of culture of which\r\nhuman nature is capable. It is the education and evolution of mankind\r\ninto freedom.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, even the older culture, which has become the\r\ninestimable foundation of the Germanic genius, makes for such a\r\nconception of the State. I may cite the words of the great leader of\r\nour science, August Böckh: \"The concept of the State must,\" according\r\nto him, \"necessarily be so broadened as to make the State the\r\ncontrivance whereby all human virtue is to be realized to the full.\"\r\n\r\nBut this fully developed conception of the State is, above all and\r\nessentially, a conception that is in a peculiar sense to be ascribed\r\nto the working classes. Others may conceive this conception of the\r\nState by force of insight and education, but to the working\r\nclasses it is, by virtue of the helpless condition of their numbers,\r\ngiven as a matter of instinct; it is forced home upon them by material\r\nand economic facts.\r\n\r\nTheir economic situation necessarily breeds in these classes an\r\ninstinctive sense that the function of the State is and must be that\r\nof helping the individual, through the combined efforts of all, to\r\nreach a development such as the individual in isolation is incapable\r\nof attaining.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, however, this ethical conception of the State does\r\nnot set up any concept that has not already previously been the real\r\nmotor principle in the State. On the contrary, it is plain from what\r\nhas already been said, that this, in an unconscious way, has been the\r\nessential nature of the State from the beginning. This essential\r\ncharacter of the State has always in some measure asserted itself\r\nthrough the logical constraint of the course of events, even when such\r\nan aim has been absent from the conscious purposes of the State, even\r\nwhen opposed to the will of those in whose hands the power of control\r\nhad rested.\r\n\r\nIn setting up this conception of the working classes as the dominant\r\nconcept of the State, therefore, we do nothing more than articularly\r\nformulate what has all along, but obscurely, been the organic nature\r\nof the State, and bring it into the foreground as the consciously\r\navowed end of society.\r\n\r\nHerein lies the comprehensive unity and continuity of all human\r\ndevelopment, that nothing drops into the course of development from\r\nthe outside. It is only that that is brought clearly into\r\nconsciousness, and worked out on the ground of free choice, which has\r\nin substance all along constituted the obscurely and unconsciously\r\neffective organic nature of things.\r\n\r\nWith the French Revolution of 1848 this clearer consciousness has made\r\nits entry upon the scene and has been proclaimed. In the first place,\r\nthis outcome was symbolically represented in that a workman was made a\r\nmember of the provisional government; and, further, there was\r\nproclaimed universal, equal and direct suffrage, which is in point of\r\nmethod the means whereby this conception of the State is to be\r\nrealized. February, 1848, therefore, marks the dawning of the\r\nhistorical period in which the ethical principle of the working\r\nclasses is consciously accepted as the guiding principle of society.\r\n\r\nWe have reason to congratulate ourselves upon living in an epoch\r\nconsecrated to the achievement of this exalted end. But, above all, it\r\nis to be said, since it is the destined course of this historical\r\nperiod to make their conception the guiding principle of society, it\r\nbehooves the working classes to conduct themselves with all moral\r\nearnestness, sobriety and studious deliberation.\r\n\r\nSuch, expressed in the briefest terms, is the content and the course\r\nof argument of the disquisition in question.\r\n\r\nWhat I have sought to accomplish in that argument is nothing else than\r\nto explain to my auditors the intrinsic philosophical content of the\r\nhistorical development, to initiate them into this most difficult of\r\nall the sciences, to bring home to them the fact that history is a\r\nlogical whole which unfolds step by step under the guidance of\r\ninexorable laws.\r\n\r\nOne who gives himself up to work of this kind is entitled to address\r\nyour public prosecutor in the words of Archimedes, when, at the\r\nsacking of Syracuse, he was set upon, sword in hand, by the savage\r\nsoldiery while drawing and studying his mathematical figures in the\r\nsand: \"_Noli turbare circulos meos_.\"[53]\r\n\r\nTo enable me to write this pamphlet, five different sciences, and more\r\nthan that, have had to be brought into coöperation and had to be\r\nmastered: History in the narrower sense of the term, Jurisprudence and\r\nthe History of Law, Political Economy, Statistics, Finance, and, last\r\nand most difficult of the sciences, the science of thought, or\r\nPhilosophy.\r\n\r\nWhat a paragon of scientific erudition must the public prosecutor be,\r\nin whose eyes all this is not sufficient to lend a publication the\r\nattribute of scientific quality.\r\n\r\nBut the indictment itself, when it is more closely examined, is seen\r\nto assign the ground on which this work is held to lack the requisite\r\nscientific character. The indictment says: \"While the defendant,\r\nLassalle, has been at pains to give himself the appearance of\r\nscientific method in this address, still the address is after all of a\r\nthoroughly practical bearing.\"\r\n\r\nSo it appears, then, that, according to the public prosecutor, the\r\naddress is not scientific because it is claimed to have a practical\r\nbearing. The test of scientific adequacy, according to the public\r\nprosecutor, is the absence of practical bearing. I may fairly be\r\npermitted to ask the public prosecutor--and it is a Schelling whose\r\nsignature this indictment bears--where he has learned all this. From\r\nhis father? Assuredly not. Schelling the elder assigns philosophy no\r\nless serious a task than that of transforming the entire cultural\r\nepoch. \"It is conceived to be too much,\" says he in formulating an\r\nanticipated objection, \"to expect that philosophy shall rehabilitate\r\nthe times.\" To this his answer is: \"But when _I_ claim to see in\r\nphilosophy a means whereby to remedy the confusion of the times, I\r\nhave, of course, in mind not an impotent philosophy, not simply a\r\nproduct of workman-like dexterity, but a forceful philosophy which can\r\nface the facts of life, philosophy which, far from feeling itself\r\nimpotent before the stupendous realities of life, far from confining\r\nitself to the dreary business of simple negation and destruction,\r\ndraws its force from reality and, therefore, reaches effective and\r\nenduring results.\"\r\n\r\nThe public prosecutor, with his brand-new and highly extraordinary\r\ndiscovery, will scarcely find much comfort with the other men of the\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nIn his Address to the German People, Fichte tells us: \"What, then, is\r\nthe bearing of our endeavors even in the most recondite of the\r\nsciences? Grant that the proximate end of these endeavors is that of\r\npropagating these sciences from generation to generation, and so\r\nconserving them; but why are they to be conserved? Manifestly only in\r\norder that they in the fulness of time shall serve to shape human life\r\nand the entire scheme of human institutions. This is the ulterior end.\r\nRemotely, therefore, even though it may be in distant ages, every\r\nendeavor of science serves to advance the ends of the State.\"\r\n\r\nNow, Your Honor and Gentlemen of the Court, if I were to spend further\r\nspeech in the refutation of this discovery of the public\r\nprosecutor--that impracticability is the test of science--I should be\r\ninsulting your intelligence.\r\n\r\nIn the pamphlet in question my aim was the thoroughly practical one of\r\nbringing my readers to a comprehension of the times in which they\r\nlive, and thereby permanently to affect their conduct throughout the\r\ncourse of their life and in whatever direction their activity may lie.\r\n\r\nNow, then, what characteristic of scientific work is it which the\r\npublic prosecutor finds wanting in all this? Is it, perhaps, that it\r\nfalls short in respect of bulk? Is it the circumstance that this work\r\nis only a pamphlet of less than fifty pages, instead of comprising\r\nthree folio volumes? But when was it decided that the bulk of a work,\r\ninstead of its contents, is to be accepted as a test of its scientific\r\ncharacter? Is the public prosecutor prepared, for instance, to deny\r\nthat the papers presented by the members of the Royal Academy at their\r\nsessions are scientific productions? But nearly all of these are\r\nshorter than this of mine.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year, as speaker for the Philosophical Society at the\r\ncelebration of Fichte's birthday, it was my fortune to present an\r\naddress in which I dealt intimately with the history of German\r\nmetaphysics. That address fills only thirty-five pages as against the\r\nforty-four pages of the present pamphlet. Is the public prosecutor\r\nprepared to deny the character of science to that address because of\r\nits brevity?\r\n\r\nWho will not, on the contrary, appreciate that the very brevity\r\nimposed by circumstances makes the scientific inquiry contained in\r\nthis work all the more difficult and the more considerable? I was\r\ncompelled to condense my exposition within the compass of a two-hours'\r\naddress, a pamphlet of forty-four pages, at the same time that I was\r\nobliged to conform my presentation of the matter to an audience on\r\nwhose part I could assume no acquaintance with scientific methods and\r\nresults. To overcome obstacles of this kind and, at the same time, not\r\nto fall short in point of profound scientific analysis, as was the\r\ncase in the present instance, requires a degree of precision, close\r\napplication and clarity of thought far in excess of what is demanded\r\nin these respects in the common run of more voluminous scientific\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nI return, therefore, again to the question: What is the requirement of\r\nscience with respect to which this address falls short? Is it,\r\nperhaps, that it offends the canons of science in respect of the place\r\nin which it was held?\r\n\r\nThis, in fact, touches the substantial core of this indictment, and,\r\nat the same time, the sorest spot of the whole. This address might\r\nwell--so runs the prosecutor's reflection--have been delivered\r\nwherever you like--from the professor's chair or from the rostrum of\r\nthe singing school, before the so-called élite of the educated people;\r\nbut that it was actually delivered before the actual people, that it\r\nwas held before workingmen and addressed to workingmen, that fact\r\ndeprives it of all standing as a scientific work and makes it a\r\ncriminal offense,--_crimen novum atque inauditum_.[54]\r\n\r\nI might, of course, content myself with the answer that the substance\r\nof an address, and therefore its scientific character, is in no way\r\naffected by the place in which it happens to have been delivered,\r\nwhether it is in the Academy of Science, before the cream of the\r\nlearned world, or in a hall in the suburbs before an audience of\r\nmachinists.\r\n\r\nBut I owe you, Gentlemen, a somewhat fuller answer. To begin with, let\r\nme express my amazement at the fact that here in Berlin, in the city\r\nwhere Fichte delivered his immortal popular lectures on philosophy, his\r\nspeeches on the fundamental features of the modern epoch and his\r\nspeeches on the German nation before the general public, that in this\r\nplace and day it should occur to any one to fancy that the place in\r\nwhich an address is delivered has anything whatever to do with its\r\nscientific character.\r\n\r\nThe great destiny of our age is precisely this--which the dark ages\r\nhad been unable to conceive, much less to achieve--the dissemination\r\nof scientific knowledge among the body of the people. The difficulties\r\nof this task may be serious enough, and we may magnify them as we\r\nlike,--still, our endeavors are ready to wrestle with them and our\r\nnightly vigils will be given to overcoming them.\r\n\r\nIn the general decay which, as all those who know the profounder\r\nrealities of history appreciate, has overtaken European history in all\r\nits bearings, there are but two things that have retained their vigor\r\nand their propagating force in the midst of all that shriveling blight\r\nof self-seeking that pervades European life. These two things are\r\nscience and the people, science and the workingman. And the union of\r\nthese two is alone capable of invigorating European culture with a new\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe union of these two polar opposites of modern society, science and\r\nthe workingman,--when these two join forces they will crush all\r\nobstacles to cultural advance with an iron hand, and it is to this\r\nunion that I have resolved to devote my life so long as there is\r\nbreath in my body.\r\n\r\nBut, Gentlemen, is this view something new and entirely unheard-of in\r\nthe realm of science? Let us see what Fichte himself, in his Addresses\r\nto the German People, has to say to the cultured classes, to whom he\r\naddresses these words: \"It is particularly to the cultured classes of\r\nGermany that I wish to direct my remarks in the present address, for\r\nit is to these classes I hope in the first place to make myself\r\nintelligible. And I implore these classes, then, as the first step to\r\nbe taken, to take the initiative in the work of reconstruction, and\r\nso, on the one hand, atone for their past deeds, and, on the other\r\nhand, earn the right to continued life in the future.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLAX BARN IN LAREN _From the Painting by Max\r\nLiebermann_]\r\n\r\nIt will appear in the course of this address that hitherto all the\r\nadvance in the German nation has originated with the common\r\npeople, and that hitherto all the great national interests have, in\r\nthe first instance, been the affair of the people, have been taken in\r\nhand and pushed forward by the body of the people; so that today for\r\nthe first time does it happen that the initiative in the cultural\r\nadvance of the nation is committed to the hands of the cultured\r\nclasses, and if they will but accept the commission it will be the\r\nfirst time when such has been the case. It will presently appear that\r\nit is quite impossible for these classes to determine how long the\r\nmatter will yet rest in their discretion, how long the choice will yet\r\nbe open to them whether to take the initiative in this matter or not,\r\nfor the whole matter is nearly ripe to be taken in hand by the people,\r\nand it will be carried out by men sprung from the body of the people,\r\nwho will presently be able to help themselves without assistance from\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\nFichte, then, knew and proclaimed this fact, that the realization of\r\nall the great national interests in the past has been the work of the\r\ncommon people and has never been carried out at the hands of the\r\ncultured classes. That, in spite of this knowledge, he turned to the\r\ncultured classes is due, as he himself says, to the hope he had of\r\nfirst and most readily making himself understood by them. It is\r\nbecause, in his apprehension, for the presentment of the matter to the\r\npeople, the whole was, so he says, \"only approaching readiness and\r\nmaturity,\" but not yet ready and mature.\r\n\r\nThat it is possible today to do what in Fichte's time was recognized\r\nas the only fruitful thing to do, but, at the same time, as not then\r\nready to be done, and therefore too serious to be undertaken,--this\r\nexpresses the whole short step in advance that has been accomplished\r\nin Germany during the past fifty years; for you will seek in vain for\r\nthe slightest progress on the part of the German government.\r\n\r\nFichte himself, in the passage cited, says that this advance is coming\r\nin the near future. This \"near future\" proves to have been fifty years\r\nremoved, and I trust, Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Court, that\r\nyou will all consider a fifty-years' interval long enough to satisfy\r\nthe requirements of the \"near future.\"\r\n\r\nBut the men who, undeterred by all the difficulties of the task, put\r\nall their energies into this stupendous undertaking of carrying\r\nscientific knowledge and scientific habits of thought among the body\r\nof the people,--are they fairly open to the accusation of having\r\nsought to incite the indigent classes to hatred of the well-to-do? Do\r\nthey not thereby really deserve the thanks and the affection of the\r\npropertied classes, and of the bourgeoisie above all?\r\n\r\nWhence arises the bourgeoisie's dread of the people in political\r\nmatters?\r\n\r\nLook back, in memory, to the months of March, April, and May, 1848.\r\nHave you forgotten how things looked here at that time? The power of\r\nthe police was broken; the people filled all the streets and public\r\nplaces. And all streets, all public places and all the people in the\r\nhands of Karbe, Lindenmüller, and other reckless agitators like\r\nthem,--men without knowledge, without intelligence, without culture,\r\nthrown into prominence by the storm which stirred our political life\r\nto its depths. The _bourgeoisie_, scared and faint hearted, hiding in\r\ntheir cellars, trembling every instant for fear of their property and\r\ntheir lives, which lay in the hands of these coarse agitators, and\r\nsaved only by the fact that these agitators were too good-natured to\r\nmake such use of their power as the bourgeoisie feared they would. The\r\n_bourgeoisie_, secretly praying for the reëstablishment of the police\r\npower and quaking with a fright which they have not yet forgotten, the\r\nrecollection of which still leaves them incapable of taking up the\r\npolitical struggle.\r\n\r\nHow came it that in a city which proudly calls itself the metropolis\r\nof intelligence, in so great a city, in the home of the most brilliant\r\nintellects,--how came it that the people here for months together\r\ncould be at the disposal of Karbe and Lindenmüller and could tremble\r\nbefore them in fear for their life and property. Where was the\r\nintelligence of Berlin? Where were the men of science and of insight?\r\nWhere were you, Gentlemen?\r\n\r\nA whole city is never cowardly.\r\n\r\nBut these men reflected and told one another: The people do not\r\nunderstand our ways of thinking; they do not even understand our\r\nspeech. There is a great gulf between our scientific views and the\r\nways of the multitude, between the speech of scientific discussion and\r\nthe habits of thought of the people. They would not understand us.\r\nTherefore the floor belongs to the coarsest.\r\n\r\nSo they reflected and held their peace. Now, Gentlemen, are you quite\r\nsure that a political upheaval will never recur? Are you ready to\r\nswear that you have reached the end of historical development? Or are\r\nyou willing to see your lives and property again at the mercy of a\r\nKarbe and a Lindenmüller?\r\n\r\nIf not, then your thanks are due to the men who have devoted\r\nthemselves to the work of filling up that gulf which separates\r\nscientific thought and scientific speech from the people, and so to\r\nraze the barriers that divide the bourgeoisie and the people. Your\r\nthanks are due these men, who, at the expense of their utmost\r\nintellectual efforts, have undertaken a work whose results will\r\nredound to the profit of each and all of you. These men you should\r\nentertain at the prytaneum, not put under indictment.\r\n\r\nThe place in which this address was held, therefore, can also not\r\nafford ground for exception as to its scientific character.\r\n\r\nI have now shown you conclusively that the production is a scientific\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nBut if, contrary to all expectation, this should still be questioned,\r\nalthough I do not for a moment consider it possible that it should be\r\nquestioned by men as enlightened as you are, Mr. President and\r\nGentlemen of the Court; now, in such a case, I seek refuge in the\r\nprivilege which is accorded every cobbler and which you can all the\r\nless deny me, viz., to submit a question of workmanship in my trade to\r\nthe award of men expert in the trade.\r\n\r\nIn the last resort, the question as to the scientific character of a\r\ngiven work is a question for the men of the trade, and therefore a\r\nquestion which may not be decided on a basis of common education and\r\ncommon culture alone, and therefore also not by a court of law. The\r\nquestion at issue does not concern jurisprudence, with which you are\r\nnecessarily familiar, but it concerns other sciences with which you\r\nmay well be unfamiliar, although, as a matter of chance, you may, in\r\nyour private capacity, not your capacity as jurists, also be\r\nacquainted with these matters.\r\n\r\nIt is true, you may answer this question in the affirmative, your\r\ncompetence extends that far. For in very many cases is the scientific\r\ncharacter of a given work manifest, even to the commonly instructed\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\nBut to pass a negative opinion in the face of the expert testimony to\r\nwhich I provisionally appeal as a subsidiary recourse;[55] to that\r\nyour competence does not extend, for the nicer question, whether in a\r\ngiven case the most profound researches of science may not, with a\r\nview to their readier apprehension, be presented in a facile and\r\npopular form, whether this fact of a facile presentation may not\r\nitself mark a peculiarly high achievement of scientific endeavor, in\r\nwhich all traces of the struggle, all difficulties and all the\r\nrefractoriness of the materials handled have been successfully\r\neliminated and the whole has in the outcome been reduced to the\r\nsimplest and clearest terms; where the result presented is a\r\nscientific work of art, which, in the words of Schiller, has risen\r\nabove the limitations of human infirmity and moves with such ease and\r\nfreedom as to give the impression that it offers but the free play of\r\nthe auditor's own unfolding thought; to decide with confidence whether\r\nyou have to deal with a scientific work of this class, and to decide\r\nit with that certainty and security that is required in order to pass\r\na sentence, that is something of which none but men trained in the\r\nscience are capable.\r\n\r\nThis question, therefore, I beg that the following gentlemen: Privy\r\nCouncillor August Böckh, Efficient Privy Councillor Johannes Schultze,\r\nformerly Director of the Ministry of Public Worship, Professor Adolf\r\nTrendelenburg, Privy Councillor and Chief Librarian Dr. Pertz, Professor\r\nLeopold Ranke, Professor Theodor Mommsen, Privy Councillor Professor\r\nHanssen, all members of the Royal Academy of Science, and as specialists\r\ncapable of judging in the matter, be constituted a subsidiary tribunal\r\nto pass on the question, whether the address in question is not in the\r\nstrict sense a scientific production.\r\n\r\nBut, if such is found to be the case, then, as I have already\r\nexplained, it has nothing to do with the penal code.\r\n\r\nI have permitted myself to go exhaustively into an exposition of this,\r\nmy first ground of defense, because, for the sake of the country\r\nitself and the dignity and liberty of science, and for the sake of\r\nestablishing once for all a precedent which shall bar out all similar\r\nendeavors of the public prosecutor in the future, it is incumbent on\r\nme to adjure you to acquit me under Article 20 of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nBut it is not that recourse to this article is necessary to protect my\r\nperson from the penalty of the law.\r\n\r\nFor, even were it held that the present case comes within the\r\ncompetence of the penal code, the law appealed to has in no wise been\r\nviolated, and the paragraph cited by the public prosecutor has no\r\napplication.\r\n\r\nEven this one exception, alone would suffice to set the indictment\r\naside; viz., that no objection is taken to any given passage in which\r\nthe specified offense is alleged to occur; so that the prosecution\r\nproceeds wholely on an allegation of bias, and in the baldest manner.\r\nThe indictment runs against a bias; that is all. But a bias is not\r\nactionable.\r\n\r\nBut I am not to be permitted to dispose of my defense in so easy a\r\nmanner. The accusation of having endeavored to incite the poor to\r\nhatred of the rich is an accusation of such a kind that, apart from\r\nall question of punishment, it is likely to injure any citizen's name\r\nand fame. This accusation is of such character that, even if it is\r\nformally disproven on legal ground, it may still leave the accused an\r\nobject of suspicion. You will, accordingly, Mr. President and\r\nGentlemen of the Court, take it simply as evidence of the respect I\r\nbear you when I now go on to clear my honor in your sight, with the\r\nsame solicitude as that with which I have defended my freedom. To this\r\nend it is necessary for me to present the grounds of fact, as\r\npainstakingly as I have presented the grounds of law, on which this\r\naccusation is to be quashed, and you will, therefore, I am sure, hear\r\nme with the same forbearance if this second part of my defense turns\r\nout to be but little briefer than the first.\r\n\r\nI am accused of having violated Section 100 of the penal code. This\r\nsection reads as follows: \"Any person who endangers or jeopardizes the\r\npublic peace by publicly inciting the subjects of the State to hatred\r\nor to contempt of one another, is liable to punishment by a fine of\r\nnot less than 20 and not more than 200 thalers, or by imprisonment of\r\nnot less than one month and not more than two years.\"\r\n\r\nThis section of the law specifies three different conditions, which\r\nmust be found to concur if it is to be applicable.\r\n\r\nI. There must be incitement to hatred or to contempt;\r\n\r\nII. This incitement must be directed to the detriment of given classes\r\nof the subjects of the State, and I am accordingly accused by the\r\npublic prosecutor of having incited the class of the unpropertied\r\nagainst the class of the propertied;\r\n\r\nIII. This incitement must be of such a nature as to endanger the\r\npublic peace.\r\n\r\nThese three conditions must concur, must combine, if the section of\r\nthe law is to apply,--and not one of these conditions occurs.\r\n\r\nAs to I. There must be incitement to hatred and contempt; there can in\r\nthe case before you be no question of this point, and for several\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\n1. The offense specified in Section 100 cannot be committed except\r\nthere be an intention to incite to hatred and contempt. A contingent\r\nincitement to hatred and contempt, an incitement by inadvertence, is\r\nin this case not conceivable. If such a contingent incitement, an\r\nunintended incitement to hatred and contempt, were conceivable, what\r\nwould not the consequences be? We have, all of us, for instance,\r\nrecently read certain speeches delivered in the upper house, which\r\nhave, we will say, filled me,--and not me alone, Gentlemen, but along\r\nwith me a very large part of the nation--with hatred and contempt to\r\nthe point of distraction. Does it follow that the public prosecutor\r\ncould take action against the speakers in question? He is not\r\ncompetent to do so, even aside from the political prerogative of the\r\nspeakers, for, although such has been the effect of these speeches,\r\nthe purpose of these gentlemen was assuredly not to stir up hatred and\r\ncontempt. But it is equally true that no one can deny that the purpose\r\nof my address was to impart knowledge. The most that the public\r\nprosecutor can allege is that it was a matter of indifference to me if\r\nthe knowledge imparted stirred up hatred and contempt,--an allegation\r\nwithout significance, since there is no such thing as an incitement to\r\nhatred and contempt by inadvertence.\r\n\r\nBut, in point of fact, a deliberate incitement of this kind is in the\r\npresent case absolutely excluded for another reason, which at the same\r\ntime establishes that the address in question could not even have had\r\nthe effect of stirring up hatred and contempt. I, therefore, in order\r\nto prevent repetition, beg to present this reason in connection with\r\nthe second, viz.: that my address could not have the effect of causing\r\nhatred and contempt.\r\n\r\nI have, therefore, to say, as the second count under this head, that\r\nthis address cannot possibly have had the effect of stirring up hatred\r\nand contempt, and _a fortiori_ cannot have had that intention.\r\n\r\nOn what grounds alone can hatred and contempt be deserved?\r\n\r\nOn the ground of viciousness, which in turn is an attribute of\r\nvoluntary human actions alone. But in this address of mine, I show\r\nthat the dominance of this principle of the bourgeoisie, against which\r\nI am by the public prosecutor accused of inciting to hatred and\r\ncontempt, is but a stage of economic and ethical development, which is\r\nthe outcome of historical necessity, and that its nonexistence is an\r\nutter impossibility and that it therefore has all the character of\r\nnatural necessity that belongs to the developmental progress of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nDo we hate Nature because we have to struggle with her? Because we\r\nhave to strive to guide her processes and improve her products?\r\n\r\nBut there is the further question: How has the public prosecutor\r\nunderstood my pamphlet?\r\n\r\nThe fundamental idea of my address is that the dominance of the\r\nbourgeoisie has in no wise been produced, consciously and by their own\r\nmotion, intentionally and in a responsible manner, by the propertied\r\nclass as persons or individuals. On the contrary, the bourgeois are\r\nbut the unconscious, choiceless, and therefore irresponsible products,\r\nnot the producers of the situation as it stands and as it has\r\ndeveloped under the guidance of quite other laws than the direction of\r\npersonal choice. Even their reluctance to surrender this their mastery\r\nI refer back to the laws of human nature, whose character it is to\r\nhold fast to whatever is and to account it necessary. But a doctrine\r\nwhich goes the length of denying the propertied class all\r\nresponsibility for the existing state of things, which makes them a\r\nproduct instead of the producers of this state of things--this\r\ndoctrine the public prosecutor construes to have incited to hatred and\r\ncontempt of these persons.\r\n\r\nFor, be it noted, we have here to do with persons and classes of\r\npersons, under section 100, not with institutions established by the\r\nState, as under section 101.\r\n\r\nNo workingman has got so faulty an understanding of my address as the\r\npublic prosecutor, and I leave it to him to say whether this is due to\r\nhis lack of understanding or to his lack of will to understand.\r\n\r\nBut, more than all this, I go on to show that the dominance of the\r\nidea of the bourgeoisie is a great historic move in the liberation of\r\nhumanity; that it was a most potent moral cultural advance; that in\r\nfact it was the historically indispensable prerequisite and\r\ntransitional stage through development out of which the idea of the\r\nworking class was to emerge.\r\n\r\nI therefore must be said to reconcile the working class to the\r\ndominance of the bourgeoisie as an historical fact by showing the\r\nlogical necessity of this dominance. I reconcile them to it, for a\r\ncomprehension of the rationality of what restricts us is the fullest\r\npossible reconciliation to it.\r\n\r\nAnd if I proceed, further, to show that the idea of the bourgeoisie is\r\nnot the highest stage of the historical development, not the perfect\r\nflower of advancing improvement, but that beyond it lies yet a higher\r\nmanifestation of the human spirit, and that this ulterior phase rests\r\non the former as its base--does this mean that I incite to hatred and\r\ncontempt of the former?\r\n\r\nThe working class might as well hate and despise themselves and all\r\nhuman nature, whether in their own or in their neighbors' persons,\r\nbecause it is the law of human nature to unfold step by step and to\r\nproceed to each succeeding stage of development from the indispensable\r\nvantage ground of the phase preceding.\r\n\r\nIf I had any predilection for homiletical discourse, Gentlemen, I\r\nshould be quite justified in saying that I have exhorted the working\r\nclasses to a filial piety toward the bourgeoisie, in that I have shown\r\nthat the dominance of the bourgeoisie was the indispensable\r\nprerequisite and condition by transition out of which alone the idea\r\nof the working class could come forth. For even if the son, by grace\r\nof a freer and fuller education and a larger endowment of personal\r\nforce, strives to place himself above the level on which his father\r\nstood, still he never forgets the source of his own blood and the\r\nauthor of his own being. How deep in the mud is it the intention to\r\nthrust the noblest of all the sciences in bringing this charge of\r\ncriminal instigation against the doctrine that history is an unfolding\r\nevolution of reason and human liberty?\r\n\r\nIt was for long incomprehensible to me how the public prosecutor could\r\nuse such words as instigation to hatred and contempt in this\r\nconnection. In the end I have been able to explain this fact to myself\r\nonly on this one supposition. The public prosecutor must have\r\nendeavored in reading this address, to put himself in the place of a\r\nworking man and has then come to feel that he would in such a case be\r\nmoved to hatred.\r\n\r\nThe public prosecutor, then, is sensible that he would hate.\r\n\r\nNow, Gentlemen, I might say that this would be attributable to the\r\npeculiarity of his temperament, and that he had no call to generalize\r\nand go beyond that. But I will lend a hand to the public prosecutor in\r\nthis perplexity. I will bring the charge against myself in a more\r\ntelling form than he has been able to do. I will formulate it as the\r\nfacts of the case require that it must be formulated if it is to be\r\npreferred at all. And in so doing, the more pointedly I may be able to\r\nbring to light the essential nature of the charge, the more utterly\r\nshall I annihilate it.\r\n\r\nThis is what the public prosecutor should have said:\r\n\r\nIt is true this address held by Lassalle appeals to the intellect of\r\nthe auditors, not to their practical impulses or their emotions. It is\r\naccordingly true also that this address does not come within the\r\nsphere of competence of the penal code.\r\n\r\nBut in a person endowed with the normal complement of human\r\nsensibility, cognition, will and emotion are not so many insulated\r\npigeonholes which stand in no relation to one another. Whenever the\r\none compartment is full it flows over into the next. Will and emotion\r\nare servants of the intellect and are controlled by it.\r\n\r\nLassalle, it is true, has not a word to say of hatred and contempt; he\r\nis simply occupied with a theoretical exposition of how certain\r\narrangements, for instance, the three-class suffrage, is pernicious. I\r\nam unable to confute this teaching. But I have this to say with\r\nrespect to the organic unity of human nature, that if the doctrine is\r\ntrue then it follows that every normally constituted working man must\r\ncome to hate and distrust not only these arrangements and institutions\r\nbut also those who profit by them.\r\n\r\nSuch is the logical framework on which this indictment must proceed.\r\nThis is the line of argument which avowedly or not, by logical\r\nnecessity comes to expression in this indictment.\r\n\r\nIt is not I, but the public prosecutor speaking from the eminence of\r\nhis curule chair, who proclaims to the working classes the awful\r\ndoctrine: You must hate and distrust.\r\n\r\nIt is not for me, it is for the public prosecutor to square himself\r\nwith the bourgeoisie.\r\n\r\nBut what is my answer to the public prosecutor and his indictment\r\nwhich charges me with his own offense?\r\n\r\nMy answer is a four-fold one:\r\n\r\nIn the first place a full recognition of the inadequacy or the\r\nviciousness of a given institution must arouse in any person of normal\r\nsensibility an enduring purpose to change such an institution, if\r\npossible, and the arousing of such an undying purpose in my hearers\r\nhas necessarily been the aim of my scientific investigation, as it\r\nnecessarily is the end of all scientific work. But such a purpose, so\r\nlong as it does not utter itself in an illegal manner, is absolutely\r\nunconstrained by law. The like is true of all effort to arouse such a\r\npurpose, so long as it does not resort to illegal means. But such a\r\npurpose to amend the shortcomings of any established arrangement, is\r\nby no means the same thing as hatred and contempt of the arrangement\r\nin question; since these shortcomings are a matter of historical\r\ngrowth, of historical necessity; since, indeed, they may even be, in\r\neffect, a factor in the work of liberation, and a factor of the\r\ngravest consequence and of the most beneficial effect for cultural\r\ngrowth. Further reasons to the like effect have already been recited\r\nand I will not take up your time with their repetition and further\r\ndevelopment. Here, then, is the first hiatus in the public\r\nprosecutor's argument.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, if it actually follows in any given case that\r\nhatred and contempt is, for a normally constituted human being, the\r\nnecessary consequence of a scientific knowledge of the facts, such\r\nhatred and contempt could by no means be laid under penalties by the\r\nlegislator.\r\n\r\nWhatever institution is so vicious that knowledge of it necessarily\r\nexcites hatred and contempt, that institution should be hated and\r\ndespised.\r\n\r\nThe legislator lays penalties upon such hatred and contempt as are but\r\nthe effects produced by blind emotions and passions. But he has not\r\nimposed penalties upon human reason and the moral constitution of man.\r\nHe consequently does not impose penalties upon hatred and contempt\r\nwhich are the necessary outcome of these two features of human nature.\r\nThe public prosecutor construes section 100 to the effect that the\r\nlegislator has therein intended to prohibit the use of reason and\r\nproscribe the moral nature of man. But such a purpose has not entered\r\nthe thoughts of the law-giver. No court will put such a construction\r\nupon the law as to make the legislator the avowed enemy of\r\nintelligence and science,--and here come into bearing again all the\r\narguments of my defense directed to Article 20 of the Constitution.\r\nThe only meaning of these arguments in this connection is that even if\r\nscience and its teaching were not by Article 20 of the Constitution\r\nexempt from the application of the criminal code, still section 100,\r\nexcept it be construed to intend the utter destruction of human\r\nnature, cannot be leveled against such hatred and contempt as is the\r\nnecessary outcome of scientific knowledge.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, hatred and contempt of a given institutional\r\narrangement or expedient is by no means the same thing as hatred and\r\ncontempt of those persons who profit by the arrangement in question;\r\nwhereas section 100 deals only with hatred of persons,--so that we\r\nhave here the third break in the public prosecutor's argument, and it\r\nis a veritable _saltomortale_.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth place I have to present an argument of fact. The\r\nprosecutor's argument presents the most remarkable _quid pro quo_[56]\r\nthat has ever come to light in a legal discussion. The point which I\r\nhere touch upon constitutes the transition to the second part of my\r\nargument, showing that all proof touching the second condition to be\r\nfulfilled by the indictment is wanting; viz.: that even if there were\r\nground for speaking of hatred and contempt in this connection, it is\r\nstill quite plain that there has been no instigation to hatred or\r\ncontempt of those against whom I am charged with having incited to\r\nhatred and contempt.\r\n\r\nAs to this second part of the indictment: I am accused of instigating\r\nthe unpropertied classes to hatred and contempt of the propertied\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\n\"By this presentation,\" says the indictment, \"working men will plainly\r\nbe incited to hatred and contempt of the bourgeoisie, that is to say,\r\nthe unpropertied classes will be inflamed against the propertied\r\nclasses.\" And after having in this way, quietly and by subreption,\r\nintroduced this its definition of the term \"_bourgeoisie_,\" the\r\nindictment goes on to formulate its final charge as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"It is accordingly charged that the above named citizen, F.L., (1),\r\n  by his lecture etc., and (2) by publishing the pamphlet containing\r\n  this same lecture, has publicly instigated the unpropertied classes\r\n  of the State's subjects to hatred and contempt of the propertied\r\n  classes.\"\r\n\r\nIt is true, in my address I speak of the \"_bourgeoisie_.\" But what is\r\nmy definition of this term? It will be sufficient to cite a single\r\npassage which contains the definition of \"_bourgeoisie_\" as used by me\r\nin this pamphlet. This will show what an incomprehensible, unheard-of,\r\nuncharacterisable _quid pro quo_ the public prosecutor has attempted\r\nto impute to me in charging me with instigating the unpropertied\r\nclasses to hatred and contempt of the propertied classes.\r\n\r\nOn page 20 of this pamphlet is the following passage, quoted\r\nliterally:\r\n\r\n  \"I have now reached the point, Gentlemen, where it becomes necessary\r\n  that, in order to avoid a possible gross misapprehension of what I\r\n  have to say, I explain what I mean by the term 'bourgeoisie' or 'great\r\n  bourgeoisie,' as the designation of a political party--that I define\r\n  what the word 'bourgeoisie' means in my use of it.\r\n\r\n  \"The word 'bourgeoisie' might be translated into German by the term\r\n  _Bürgertum_ (citizenship, or the body of citizens). But that is not the\r\n  meaning actually attached to the word. We are all citizens--workingmen,\r\n  petty burghers, commercial aristocracy and all the rest alike. On the\r\n  other hand the word 'bourgeoisie' has, in the course of historical\r\n  development, come to designate a particular political bias and\r\n  movement which I will now go on to characterize.\r\n\r\n  \"At the time of the French Revolution, and, indeed, even yet, that entire\r\n  body of subjects which is not of noble birth, was roughly divided into\r\n  two sub-classes: First the class comprising those persons who, wholly or\r\n  chiefly, get their income from their own labor and are without capital,\r\n  or are, at the most, possessed of but a moderate capital which affords\r\n  them the means of carrying on some employment from which they and their\r\n  families derive their subsistence. This class comprises the\r\n  workingmen, the lower middle classes (_Kleinbürger_), the citizen\r\n  class and also the body of the peasants. The second class is made up\r\n  of those persons who have the disposal of a large property, of a large\r\n  capital, and who are producers or receivers of income on the basis of\r\n  their possession of capital. These latter might be called the great\r\n  burghers or commoners, or the capitalist gentry. But such a great\r\n  burgher or capitalist gentleman, is not by reason of that fact a\r\n  bourgeois. No commoner has any objection to raise because a nobleman\r\n  in the bosom of his family finds comfort in his pedigree and in his\r\n  lands. But when, on the other hand, this nobleman insists on making\r\n  such pedigree or such landed property the basis of a peculiar\r\n  importance and prerogative in the State, when he insists on making\r\n  them a ground for controlling public policy, then the commoner takes\r\n  offense at the nobleman and calls him a feudalist.\r\n\r\n  \"The case is entirely similar as regards the distinctions in respect\r\n  of property within the body of commoners.\r\n\r\n  \"That the capitalist gentleman in his chamber takes pleasure in the high\r\n  degree of comfort and the great advantage which large wealth confers\r\n  upon its possessor,--nothing can be more natural, simpler or more\r\n  legitimate than that he should do so.\"\r\n\r\nIncidentally, then, Gentlemen, so far am I in this pamphlet from\r\ninstigating the unpropertied classes to hatred and contempt of the\r\nwealthy, that, on the contrary, I expressly declare myself for the\r\nlegitimacy of such property. I explicitly declare that the\r\nsatisfaction taken in the advantages and amenities which flow from\r\nsuch wealth are the most natural and legitimate things in the world.\r\n\r\nLet me now go on with the definition referred to:\r\n\r\n  \"The workingmen and the lower middle class, that is to say the class\r\n  without capital, may be wholly justified in demanding that those by whose\r\n  hands all that wealth which is the pride of our civilization is produced,\r\n  whose hands have brought forth all these products without which society\r\n  could not live for a single day--it may well be demanded that these should\r\n  be secured an ample and unfailing income, and thereby be given an\r\n  opportunity for some intellectual development, and that they be by this\r\n  means put in the way of a truly human manner of life. But, while I\r\n  am free to say that the working classes are fairly within their rights in\r\n  making these demands of the State, and to stand out stiffly for their\r\n  demands as being the essential purpose for which the State exists, yet\r\n  the workingman must never allow himself to forget that all property\r\n  that has once been acquired and is legally held must be considered lawful\r\n  and inviolable.\"\r\n\r\nSuch, then, is the manner and degree of my instigation of the\r\nunpropertied class to hatred and distrust that I incontinently preach\r\nto them the inviolability and sacredness of all property acquired by\r\nthe wealthy classes, and exhort them to respect it.\r\n\r\nBut I go on to say:\r\n\r\n  \"In case the man of means is not content with the material amenities\r\n  of large wealth, but insists that possession of wealth, of capital, be\r\n  made the basis of a control to be exercised over the State, a condition\r\n  of participation in the direction of public policy and of the direction\r\n  of public affairs, then and only then does the man of means become a\r\n  bourgeois; then does he make the fact of property a legal ground of\r\n  political power; then does he stand forth as representative of a\r\n  privileged class aiming to put the imprint of its prerogative upon all\r\n  social features and institutions, just as truly as the nobility of the\r\n  Middle Ages did with respect to the basis of their privilege, landed\r\n  property.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly, in my use of the term, as I have explicitly and\r\npainstakingly defined it, the man of means, the man of the\r\nupper-middle class, is a _bourgeois_ in case he proceeds to set up the\r\nessentially harmless and inoffensive fact of his large property as a\r\nlegal condition of participation in the direction of public affairs;\r\nin short, when he proceeds to set up the ownership of capital as a\r\nlegal and political prerogative, and so abolishes the equality of the\r\npropertied and the unpropertied classes before the law, and thereby\r\ninfringes upon the liberty and further growth of the people, in the\r\ninterest of accumulated wealth and continued upper-class mastery. Only\r\nunder these circumstances, as I particularly point out, does the\r\n_bourgeoisie_ become a privileged class, which it otherwise, in spite\r\nof all inequality of wealth, is not.\r\n\r\nIn my pamphlet I point out how all this has its effect through the\r\ncensus rating whereby admission to a share in the direction of public\r\npolicy, through eligibility to any legislative body, is so limited by\r\nproperty qualifications as to make the possession of capital a\r\nprerequisite. I point out further that this effect follows equally\r\nwhether the property qualification is open and above-board or\r\nunder-hand, and finally that the existing three-class system of\r\nelections, dating back to 1849, amounts to such an under-hand,\r\ndisguised property rating.\r\n\r\nThe point at which the pamphlet strikes, therefore, albeit in a purely\r\ntheoretical way, is the three-class system of elections. It makes no\r\nattack upon the propertied classes, whose accumulated wealth, on the\r\ncontrary, I am repeatedly at pains to define as wholly incontestable,\r\ninoffensive, inviolable and perfectly lawful.\r\n\r\nThis three-class system of elections is one of our political\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nNow, this being the case, why has not the public prosecutor indicted\r\nme under section 101 of the criminal code, \"for having exposed the\r\nmeasures of the State to hatred and to contempt?\" To be sure, if the\r\nprosecutor had chosen to make this charge, I should have known how to\r\nanswer him. To go into this matter today would be superfluous,\r\nfor I am not accused of this offense, and my defense would be drawn\r\nout endlessly if I were to defend myself against charges that have\r\nnever been brought against me.\r\n\r\nBut why, among all impossible charges, does the public prosecutor\r\nchoose to bring precisely the most impossible? Why does he make this\r\nsubstitution as to the point of my attack? I point out that the\r\nthree-class system of elections is an injustice because it makes an\r\nessentially innocent difference in wealth a legal qualification for\r\nparticipation in the direction of public affairs; whereupon this\r\nenvenomed accusation is brought against me that I have instigated the\r\nunpropertied classes to hatred and contempt of the propertied.\r\n\r\nIs there, then, no remedy, Gentlemen, against such a public defamation\r\nof one's name and fame?\r\n\r\nCan we say that among us the introduction, of the three-class system\r\nof elections is to be laid at the door of the propertied classes or\r\nthe commonalty? Something of that kind might be said of the French\r\n_bourgeoisie_. In France the property qualification and rating was\r\nintroduced as long ago as the revolutionary _Assemblée Constituante_.\r\nBut the like has not been done by the German.\r\n\r\nWhen the Prussian bourgeoisie came into power through the March\r\nrevolution of 1848 it introduced universal and equal suffrage by the\r\nlaw of the 8th of April, 1848. The German bourgeoisie at St. Paul's\r\nChurch, Frankfort, enacted universal equal suffrage.\r\n\r\nThe three-class system of elections which we now have, was arbitrarily\r\nimposed, imposed by the government.\r\n\r\nNow, why does the public prosecutor shelter the government behind the\r\nbacks of the Prussian _bourgeoisie? A tout seigneur tout honneur_![57]\r\n\r\nIt is the Prussian government, not the propertied classes, that must\r\nfor all time and in the eyes of all people bear the responsibility of\r\nthis arbitrarily imposed three-class system of elections.\r\n\r\nBut, whatever may have been the reasons which decided the public\r\nprosecutor to make this very singular substitution of grievances in\r\nhis indictment--and we may perhaps presently come to find out what his\r\nreasons were--at any rate, this second ground of the indictment also\r\nfails. There has been no incitement against the propertied classes of\r\nthe community; there has been no instigation against those against\r\nwhom I am accused of instigating to hatred and contempt.\r\n\r\nThe third ground on which the indictment is brought, the charge of\r\nhaving endangered the public peace, fails likewise.\r\n\r\nAs to this third count:\r\n\r\n  Section 100 says: \"Any person who endangers the public peace by\r\n  publicly inciting the subjects of the State to hatred or to contempt\r\n  of one another is to be punished.\"\r\n\r\nNow, when the State speaks of the public peace it cannot be taken to\r\nmean peace of mind, for the State is not a pietistic overseer\r\nconcerned about the subjects' peace of mind and the general sphere of\r\nspiritual edification. What it looks to is the peace of the streets.\r\nThis is made quite plain by the phrase, \"public peace.\"\r\n\r\nThe like is plain from all principles of law. Subjective states of\r\nmind do not concern the State; it is concerned with overt actions\r\nalone. It has, accordingly, no concern with hatred and contempt or\r\nwith instigation thereto in so far as they are a matter of subjective\r\nsensibility only; but such instigation is subject to penalties only in\r\ncase it is of such a nature as to lead to overt action. This is very\r\npatently indicated by the legislator in making use of the expression,\r\n\"Any person who endangers public peace.\" The legislator says not any\r\none who \"disturbs,\" but any one who \"endangers.\" If, in the\r\ncontemplation of the law, any incitement whatever to hatred and\r\ncontempt were punishable; if, in the contemplation of the law, the\r\npublic peace were to be \"endangered\" through the mere incitement to\r\nsuch subjective sentiments; then the law would necessarily have said:\r\nany person who disturbs the public peace by inciting. If such had been\r\nthe phrasing of the law, then it might perhaps be held that such\r\ndisturbance always follows when instigation to hatred and contempt is\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n\"Endanger\" means to bring about the possibility of a disturbance, and\r\nby his choice of this term, therefore, the legislator has shown us\r\nthat in speaking of the public peace he has not in mind a harmony of\r\nsentiments--which in the case contemplated must already have been\r\ndisturbed, not simply endangered--but the peace of the streets. He has\r\nshown that he does not consider that a disturbance of the public peace\r\nnecessarily has arisen in case of incitement to subjective sentiments\r\nof hatred and contempt. Consequently not every case of such incitement\r\nis held to be punishable, but only those cases in which the peace of\r\nthe streets is in danger of being disturbed. In other words the\r\npenalty follows only when the incitement to hatred and contempt\r\nattains such a pitch as to become dangerous, that is to say, liable to\r\nresult in overt unlawful acts. Section 100 is accordingly not to be\r\ntaken to say that any person who incites to hatred and contempt\r\nendangers the public peace and is therefore subject to punishment.\r\nSuch an interpretation would be wholly fallacious, on juridical as\r\nwell as on grammatical grounds. Its meaning is that any person who\r\nputs the public peace in jeopardy through inciting to hatred and\r\ncontempt--that is to say in case the incitement is of such a nature\r\nthat it necessarily carries danger to the public peace--such a person\r\nis subject to the penalties of this law. In making use of the term\r\n\"endanger,\" therefore, the law defines the crime of incitement to this\r\neffect, that it must be incitement of such a kind that it at least may\r\nlead to overt action--to the endangering of the peace of the\r\nstreets--otherwise it is not punishable.\r\n\r\nTo show how far my action falls short of this third criterion, how\r\nlittle the alleged instigation is of the kind which might, even\r\nconceivably, lead to tangible action in the way of endangering the\r\npolitical peace, the peace of the public highways--to this end let me\r\nsimply point out that in this address I am occupied with a discussion\r\nof periods of historical development of secular duration, and at the\r\nclose I make the explicit statement that in the advance of a\r\nhistorical dawning one or two decades count but as a single hour in\r\nthe revolution of a natural day.\r\n\r\nSo that we have here to do with an indictment which meets the\r\nrequirements of the law at not a single point; whereas in order to an\r\nadequate charge, the several counts should concur, should combine and\r\nbear one another out.\r\n\r\nIt has frequently happened that indictments have been made in which\r\nsome one count has not been well taken. But an indictment of which not\r\neven a single count proves to come within the contemplation of the\r\nlaw,--such an indictment deserves a special, and in every sense of the\r\nword a peculiar, place on honor in the temple of jurisprudence.\r\n\r\nHowever, _audiatur et altera pars_.[58] Let us take one last look at\r\nthe motivation which the indictment offers. In so doing it is possible\r\nthat we shall find that in what I have been saying I have, by some\r\nhighly ingenious artifice of exposition, succeeded in concealing the\r\nlegally offensive features of my action; or on the other hand it may\r\nturn out that the totally nugatory character of this indictment will\r\nby this means be brought out in even more startling fashion than has\r\nyet appeared.\r\n\r\nThere is one sentence in this indictment which serves as underpinning to\r\nthe whole structure. This sentence may, therefore, be expected to be of\r\nselected timber. The preamble of the document says: \"The leading ideas\r\nof this address are as follows:--\" and then, having given an ostensible\r\n_resumé_ of these ideas, it goes on to the following effect: \"By these\r\nexpositions, and by the frequently recurring allusions to an imminent\r\nsocial revolution, the workingmen will manifestly be provoked to hatred\r\nand contempt of the bourgeoisie; that is to say, the unpropertied\r\nclasses will be stirred up against the propertied, whereby the public\r\npeace will be endangered, particularly since the address contains a\r\ndirect appeal to make the mastery of the working class over the other\r\nclasses of society the end of their endeavors, to be pursued with the\r\nmost ardent and consuming passion.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the only passage in the document that is of the nature of a\r\nlegal motivation. Let us look more closely into this sentence. This is\r\na sentence which might give the asthma to a person with weak lungs,\r\nand it is so constructed as to hide its total lack of substance from\r\nany superficial view under a shimmering verbiage and a confusion of\r\nideas. If you will look more closely into this passage, Gentlemen, you\r\nwill be astonished at the quantity of juristic monstrosities,\r\nabsurdities, misstatements and misconstructions of fact which it\r\ncontains.\r\n\r\nNow, whereby, according to this passage, have I accomplished my\r\nalleged incitement to hatred and contempt? \"By these expositions,\"\r\nsays the document. That is to say by a purely theoretical, purely\r\nobjective exposition of historical events; by what the indictment\r\nitself designates as the exposition of my leading ideas; by nothing\r\nelse, therefore, than the scientific doctrine simply. It is by this\r\nmeans that I am alleged to have incited to hatred and contempt. The\r\nindictment may shift and turn as it likes; it cannot escape the avowal\r\nthat its accusation runs against nothing else than purely scientific\r\narguments,--against science and its teaching.\r\n\r\nBut the passage goes on to add an \"and.\" By these expositions _and_ by\r\nthe frequently recurring allusions to an imminent social revolution is\r\nthe instigation alleged to have been effected.\r\n\r\nWhat are these allusions to an imminent social revolution? Where are\r\nthey to be found? Why does not the public prosecutor cite them? I call\r\nupon him to do so. But he cannot cite them. There is no passage in\r\nthis pamphlet which will bear out his insinuations on this point.\r\n\r\nIt is true, throughout this pamphlet I make frequent use of the words\r\n\"revolutionary\" and \"revolution;\" although I do not speak of an\r\n\"imminent social revolution,\" as the public prosecutor alleges. What\r\nI speak of is a social revolution which supervened in February, 1848.\r\nBut with this word, \"revolution,\" the public prosecutor hopes to crush\r\nme. For he, taking the word in its narrower legal sense alone, cannot\r\nread this word, \"revolution,\" without conjuring up before his fancy\r\nthe brandishing of pitchforks. But such is not the meaning of the word\r\nin its scientific use, and the consistent use of the term in my\r\npamphlet might have apprised the public prosecutor of the fact that\r\nthe term is there employed in its alternative, scientific\r\nsignification. So, for instance, I speak of the development of the\r\nterritorial principality as a \"revolutionary\" phenomenon.\r\n\r\nAnd so again, on the other hand, I expressly declare that the peasant\r\nwars, which, assuredly, were sufficiently garnished with violence and\r\nbloodshed,--I declare these wars to have been a movement which was\r\nrevolutionary only in the imagination of those who participated in\r\nthem, whereas they were in reality not a revolutionary, but a\r\nreactionary movement.\r\n\r\nThe progress of industry which took place in the sixteenth century, on\r\nthe contrary, I repeatedly and constantly characterize as a \"really\r\nand veritably revolutionary fact\" (page 7), although no sword was\r\ndrawn on its account. Likewise I characterize (page 7) the invention\r\nof the spinning jenny in 1775 as a radical and effectual revolution.\r\n\r\nIs this an abuse of language, or am I hereby introducing a novel use\r\nof words in making use of the term \"revolution\" in this sense,--in\r\nthat I apply it to peaceful developments and deny it to sanguinary\r\ndisturbances!\r\n\r\nThe elder Schelling says (_Untersuchungen über das Wesen der\r\nmenschlichen Freiheit_, Vol. VII, p. 351): \"The happy thought of\r\nmaking freedom the all in all of Philosophy has not only made the\r\nhuman intellect free as regards its own motives and effected a greater\r\nchange in this science in all directions than any earlier revolution,\"\r\netc. The elder Schelling, at least, does not, like the public\r\nprosecutor's fancy, see pitchforks flashing before his eyes at the\r\nsound of the word \"revolution.\" Applying the word, as he does, to the\r\neffects wrought by a philosophical principle, he takes it, as I do, in\r\na sense which has no relation whatever to physical violence.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is the scientific meaning of this word \"revolution,\" and\r\nhow does revolution differ from reform? Revolution means\r\ntransmutation, and a revolution is, accordingly, accomplished\r\nwhenever, by whatever means, with or without shock or violence, an\r\nentirely new principle is substituted for what is already in effect. A\r\nreform, on the other hand, is effected in case the existing situation\r\nis maintained in point of principle, but with a more humane, more\r\nconsequent or juster working out of this principle. Here, again, it is\r\nnot a question of the means. A reform may be effected by means of\r\ninsurrection and bloodshed, and a revolution may be carried out in\r\npiping times of peace. The peasant wars were an attempt at compelling\r\na reform by force of arms. The development of industry was a\r\nfull-blown revolution, accomplished in the most peaceable manner; for\r\nin this latter case an entirely new and novel principle was put in the\r\nplace of the previously existing state of affairs. Both these ideas\r\nare developed at length and with great pains in the pamphlet under\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nHow comes it that the public prosecutor alone has failed to understand\r\nme? Why is all this unintelligible to him alone, when every workingman\r\nunderstands it?\r\n\r\nNow, even suppose that I had spoken of an \"imminent social\r\nrevolution,\" as in point of fact I did not; would I, therefore,\r\nnecessarily have been talking of pitchforks and bayonets?\r\n\r\nProfessor Huber is a thoroughly conservative man, a strenuous\r\nroyalist, a man who, on the adoption of the constitution of 1850,\r\nvoluntarily resigned the professor's chair which he held in the\r\nUniversity of Berlin, because, if I am rightly informed, he had\r\nscruples about subscribing to it; but at the same time he is a man who\r\nis with the deepest affection devoted to the welfare of the working\r\nclasses, who has given the most painstaking study to their development\r\nand has written most excellent works upon that subject, particularly\r\nupon the history of industrial corporations or labor organizations.\r\nAfter having shown that the labor organizations of England, France,\r\nand Germany already have in hand a capital of fifty million thalers,\r\nProfessor Huber says in this latest work (_Concordia_, p. 24):\r\n\r\n  \"Under these circumstances and under the influences herein at work,\r\n  and in view of the historical facts above indicated in outline, it is\r\n  to be hoped that I need enter no disclaimer against Utopian daydreams\r\n  of a universal millenium when I say that not only is a very substantial\r\n  reform of the existing political conditions of the factory population\r\n  practicable in such a measure as to bring about an elevation of their\r\n  entire social and economic situation, but such a reform is to be looked\r\n  for as in the natural course of things the assured outcome of the\r\n  growth of labor organizations.\"\r\n\r\nHere we have a prediction of a thoroughgoing social transmutation\r\nspoken of as the assured outcome of the labor-organization movement\r\nworking out its effects simply within the lines of the peaceable and\r\nconventional course of things. But how if I, with all the stronger\r\nreason, had spoken of a prospective social change that might be\r\nexpected to result from the combined force of the two factors,\r\norganized labor and universal suffrage?\r\n\r\nBut how can I be held accountable for the public prosecutor's literary\r\nlimitations? for his lack of acquaintance with what is going on all\r\naround us in modern times and what science has already accepted and\r\nmade a matter of record? Am I the scientific whipping-boy of the\r\npublic prosecutor? If that were the case, the punishment which it\r\nwould be for you, Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Court, to mete\r\nout to me would be something stupendous. But all that apart, how can\r\nan allusion to an imminent social revolution, even to a pitchfork\r\nrevolution, constitute an instigation to hatred and contempt of the\r\nbourgeoisie? And this is, after all, what the public prosecutor must\r\nbe held to allege in the passage cited, and this in fact is what he\r\ndoes allege. Hatred and contempt can be aroused against any man only\r\nby his own acts and their publicity. But how can anything done by\r\nPeter excite the hatred and contempt of Paul? If any one were to tell\r\nus: \"The workingmen are going to get up a social revolution,\" how\r\ncould that remark arouse hatred and contempt of the bourgeoisie? The\r\npassage in question, then, shows itself to have been one that makes no\r\nsense, either in point of grammar or in point of logic. It is not only\r\nuntrue with a threefold untruth, but it is contradictory and\r\nmeaningless. At least it is quite unintelligible to me.\r\n\r\nI have as great difficulty in understanding the public prosecutor's\r\nlanguage as he has in understanding mine. The Greeks were in the habit\r\nof calling any one _barbaros_ (a barbarian) who did not understand the\r\ncurrent speech. So the public prosecutor and I are both barbarians,\r\nthe one to the other.\r\n\r\nBut this passage in the indictment which I have been analyzing brings\r\nup a third point at which I am alleged to have been guilty of inciting\r\nto hatred and contempt of the bourgeoisie. This is introduced with the\r\nword \"particularly.\" The exposition and the allusions above spoken of\r\nare alleged to have incited to hatred and contempt, \"particularly\r\nbecause the address contains a direct appeal to make the mastery of\r\nthe working classes over the other classes of society the end of their\r\nendeavors, to be pursued with the most ardent and consuming passion.\"\r\nSuppose that such were the case; an exhortation addressed to a given\r\nclass of society to pursue the vain ambition of a mastery over the\r\nother classes would be worthy of all reprobation, but it would still\r\nbe legally permissible unless it urged to criminal acts. Every class\r\nin society is at liberty to strive for the control of the State, so\r\nlong as it does not seek to realize its end by unlawful means. No\r\npolitical purpose is punishable, the means employed alone are. Now,\r\nthe character of this prosecution, as a prosecution directed against a\r\npolitical bias, appears plainly and should be manifest to every one in\r\nevery line of the indictment, in that it constantly charges incitement\r\nto the seeking of certain ends; it never attempts to show that\r\ncriminal means have been employed, or that I have, in my address,\r\nurged the employment of such means. But even if I had been guilty of\r\nurging the working classes to resort to criminal means for gaining\r\ncontrol over the other classes of society, then I could only have been\r\nindicted under Article 61,[59] or some other article of the criminal\r\ncode, but never under Article 100, or as having offended against that\r\narticle by an instigation of the workingmen to hatred and contempt;\r\nfor such an exhortation addressed to the working classes to make\r\nthemselves masters of the other classes of society must have incited\r\nthe workingmen to political ambition, but by no means to hatred and\r\ncontempt of any third party. This ambition on the part of the\r\nworkingmen could, of course, not have been fathered upon the\r\nbourgeoisie; and since responsibility for it could not have been put\r\nupon them, hatred and contempt of them could not have been aroused by\r\nthe fact of such an ambition. It therefore appears again that this\r\npassage is quite devoid of grammatical and logical content. But upon\r\nwhat ground has the public prosecutor read into my address an\r\nexhortation urging to the pursuit of \"mastery on the part of the\r\nworkingmen over the other classes of society?\"\r\n\r\nAll that I have to say in my pamphlet bearing on this head is that it\r\nis the destiny of the historical epoch beginning with February, 1848,\r\nto install the ethical principle of the working classes as the\r\ndominant principle of society, to make it the guiding principle of the\r\nState; the nature of this principle is expounded in my pamphlet, and I\r\nhave already restated it in outline in the introductory part of my\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\nI repeatedly and explicitly express myself to the same effect. So I\r\nsay (page 31) that, as in 1789 the revolution was a revolution of the\r\nthird estate, so in this later case it was a revolution of the fourth\r\nestate, \"which now seeks to erect its principle into the dominant\r\nprinciple of society and to permeate all institutions with it.\" Or\r\nagain\r\n\r\n(page 32): \"Whoever, therefore, appeals to the principle of the\r\nworking class as the dominant principle of society;\" and, further, on\r\nthe same page: \"We have now to examine, in three several hearings,\r\nthis principle of the working class as the dominant principle of\r\nsociety.\" And (page 33): \"Perhaps the idea of making the principle of\r\nthe lowest class of society the dominant principle of the State and of\r\nsociety may seem to be a dangerous idea.\" I, then, proceed to develop,\r\nfrom page 39 onward, the difference between the ethical and political\r\nprinciple of the bourgeoisie and the ethical and political principle\r\nof the working class, and conclude on page 42 with the words: \"This,\r\nthen, is it, Gentlemen, that is to be characterized as the political\r\nprinciple of the working class,\" etc.\r\n\r\nAnd because I present an exalted ethical principle, the noblest\r\nethical principle which my intelligence is capable of grasping, the\r\nnoblest ethical principle yet achieved by political philosophy,\r\nbecause I proclaim this as destined to become the guiding principle of\r\nthe present period of history; because of this and because I bring\r\nevidence to show that this principle, as being the expression of the\r\nnatural instinct due to the economic situation of the working classes,\r\nis properly to be designated as the principle of the working\r\nclasses,--this is what the public prosecutor has construed into an\r\natrocious crime, and has accused me of urging the working classes to\r\naim at making their own class the masters of the other classes of\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nThe public prosecutor appears to believe that I aspire to see the\r\npropertied classes reduced to servitude under the working classes,\r\nthat I would invert history and make the landed gentry and the\r\nmanufacturers the servants of the workingmen.\r\n\r\nBut however widely we may differ in the use of language, however much\r\nwe may mutually be barbarians to one another, could such a\r\nmisapprehension, or anything approaching it, be at all possible?\r\n\r\nI develop (page 32) my view, explicitly and in detail, to the effect\r\nthat this is precisely the characteristic mark of the fourth estate,\r\nthat its principle contains no ground of discrimination, whether in\r\npoint of fact or in point of law, such as could be erected into a\r\ndomineering prerogative and applied to reconstruct the institutions of\r\nsociety to that end. The words I use are as follows (page 32):\r\n\"Laborers we all are, in so far as we are willing to make ourselves\r\nuseful to human society in any way whatever. This fourth estate, in\r\nthe recesses of whose heart there lies no germ of a new and further\r\ndevelopment of privilege, is therefore a term coincident with the\r\nhuman race. Its concerns are, therefore, in truth the concerns of\r\nmankind as a whole; its freedom is the freedom of mankind itself; its\r\nsovereignty is the sovereignty of all men.\" And I thereupon go on to\r\nsay: \"Therefore, whoever appeals to the principle of the working class\r\nas the dominant principle of society, in the sense in which I have\r\npresented this idea,--his cry is not a cry designed to divide the\r\nclasses of society,\" etc. And while I, with all my heart and soul, am\r\nmaking an appeal for the termination of all class rule and all class\r\nantagonism, the public prosecutor charges me with inciting the\r\nlaborers to establish class rule over the propertied classes. I ask\r\nagain: How is such an astonishing misunderstanding to be explained?\r\nPermit me once again, to quote the father against the son:\r\n\r\n  \"The medium,\" says Schelling (Vol. I, p. 243, _Abhandlungen zur\r\n  Erläuterung des Idealismus der Wissenschaftslehre_)--\"The medium\r\n  whereby intellects understand one another is not the circumambient\r\n  atmosphere, but the joint and common freedom whose movements penetrate\r\n  to the innermost recesses of the soul. A human spirit not consciously\r\n  replete with freedom is excluded from all spiritual communion, not only\r\n  with others but even with himself. No wonder, therefore, that he\r\n  remains incomprehensible to himself as well as to others, and wearies\r\n  himself in his pitiable solitude with empty words which stir no friendly\r\n  response whether in his own or in another's breast. To be unintelligible\r\n  to such an unfortunate is a credit and an honor before God and man.\"\r\n\r\nSo says Schelling, the father.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I have now reached the close of my argument. It were\r\nbootless to ask whether this charge could possibly have any weight\r\nwith you, Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Court. But there was\r\nprobably another design at the root of the prosecution. The political\r\nstruggle between the bourgeoisie and the government has lately shown\r\nsome slight signs of life. It has, not improbably, been thought that\r\nunder these circumstances a prosecution for incitement of the\r\nunpropertied classes to hatred and contempt of the propertied classes\r\nwould create an effective diversion; it was probably hoped that even\r\nif such an accusation were dismissed by you, still--you remember the\r\nancient adage: _calumniare audacter, semper aliquit haeret_[60]--it\r\nwould serve as a wet towel to bind about the slightly-inflamed\r\ncountenance of our bourgeoisie,--and so, with this in view, Gentlemen,\r\nI was selected as the scapegoat to be driven out into the wilderness.\r\nBut even this design, Gentlemen, will fail.\r\n\r\nIt will fail shamefully through the mere reading of my pamphlet, which\r\nI most particularly commend to the bourgeoisie. It will fail before\r\nthe force of my own voice; and precisely with this in view I felt\r\ncalled on to go so extensively into the facts of the case in my\r\ndefense. We are all, bourgeoisie and laborers, members of one people,\r\nand we stand firmly together against our oppressors.\r\n\r\nLet me now close. Upon a man who, as I have presented the matter to\r\nyou, has devoted his life under the motto, \"Science and the\r\nWorkingmen,\" even a sentence which may meet him on the way will make\r\nno other impression beyond that made upon a chemist by the breaking of\r\na retort used by him in his scientific experiments. With a momentary\r\nknitting of the brow and a reflection on the physical properties of\r\nmatter, as soon as the accident is remedied he goes on with his\r\nexperiments and his investigation as before.\r\n\r\nBut I appeal to you that for the sake of the nation and its honor, for\r\nthe sake of science and its dignity, for the sake of the country and\r\nits liberty under the law, for the sake of your own memory as history\r\nshall preserve it, Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Court, acquit\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: The criteria which are here appealed to as working the\r\ndifferences of spiritual constitution between the so-called Germanic\r\npeoples and the peoples of antiquity are today questioned at more than\r\none point. And quite legitimately so. Considered as peoples simply,\r\nthe Greeks or Romans were scarcely less capable of development than\r\nthe Germanic peoples. That their States, their political\r\norganizations, collapsed because of the decay of certain institutional\r\narrangements peculiar to the social life of the times, that is a\r\nfortune in which the states of antiquity quite impartially have shared\r\nwith the various States of the Germanic world. Political structures in\r\ngeneral are capable of but a moderate degree of development. If the\r\ndevelopment proceeds beyond this critical point the result, sooner or\r\nlater, is a historical cataclysm, whereby the old State is supplanted\r\nby a new form of social organization resting on a new foundation. As\r\nelements in this new foundation there may be comprised new religious\r\nor new ethical notions, but, in a general way, it is to be said that,\r\nexcept in the theocratic States, the rôle played by religion is only\r\nof secondary importance even in antiquity.\r\n\r\nSocrates was not the first nor the only one in Greece who had taught\r\n\"new gods.\" That he in particular was called on to drink the hemlock\r\nwas due to reasons of State policy, which had but a very slight and\r\nunessential relation to the acts of sacrilege of which he was accused.\r\nIt may be added that this Greek promulgator of new gods is among the\r\nGerman peoples fairly matched by John Huss and thousands of other\r\nvictims of religious persecution.\r\n\r\nLassalle's mistake lies in this, that he seeks the motor force of\r\ndevelopment in the \"spirit\" of the nations, instead of looking for an\r\nexplanation of their spiritual life in the peculiar circumstances\r\nwhich condition their development. But, in spite of this, it must be\r\nsaid that his conclusions as bearing upon the modern situation are for\r\nthe most part substantially sound.--TRANSLATOR.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: According to this doctrine, the motions of the\r\n\"Monads\"--animistically conceived units of which the entire universe,\r\norganic or inorganic, was held to be constituted--were (by the fiat of\r\nGod at the creation of the world) bound in a preordained sequence, in\r\nsuch a manner that all these motions constitute a comprehensive,\r\nharmonious series.

BABBITT, A.B.\r\n\r\nAssistant Professor of German, Tufts College\r\n\r\n\r\nGentlemen:--You have asked me in your letter to express my opinion,\r\nin any way that seems suitable to me, on the workingmen's movement\r\nand the means which it should use to attain an improvement of the\r\ncondition of the working class in political, material, and intellectual\r\nmatters--especially on the value of associations for the class of\r\npeople who have no property.\r\n\r\nI have no hesitation in following your wishes, and I choose the form\r\nwhich is simplest and most suitable to the nature of the matter--the\r\nform of a public letter of reply to your communication.\r\n\r\nLast October in Berlin, at a time when I was absent from here, during\r\nyour first preliminary discussion concerning the German Workingmen's\r\nCongress--a discussion which I followed in the newspapers with\r\ninterest--two opposing views were brought forward in the meeting.\r\n\r\nOne was to the effect that you have no concern whatever with political\r\nagitation and that it has no interest for you.\r\n\r\nThe other, in distinction from this, was that you were to consider\r\nyourselves an appendix to the Prussian Progressive party, and to\r\nfurnish a sort of characterless chorus or sounding-board for it.\r\n\r\nIf I had attended that meeting, I should have expressed myself against\r\nboth views. It is utterly narrow-minded to believe that political\r\nagitation and political progress do not concern the workingman. On the\r\ncontrary, the workingman can expect the realization of his legitimate\r\nambitions only from political liberty.\r\n\r\nEven the question to what extent you are allowed to meet, discuss your\r\ninterests, form general and local unions for their consideration,\r\netc., is a question which depends upon the political situation and\r\nupon political legislation, and therefore it is not worth the trouble\r\neven to refute such a narrow view by further consideration.\r\n\r\nNo less false and misleading was the other view which was placed\r\nbefore you, namely, to consider yourselves politically a mere annex of\r\nthe Progressive party.\r\n\r\nIt would certainly be unjust not to recognize that the Progressive\r\nparty, in its struggle with the Prussian Government, performed at that\r\ntime a certain service, though a moderate one, in behalf of political\r\nliberty, by its insistence upon the right of granting appropriations\r\nand its opposition to the reorganization of the army in Prussia.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the realization of that suggestion is completely out of\r\nthe question, for the following reasons:\r\n\r\nIn the first place, such a position was in no way fitting for a\r\npowerful independent party with much more important political\r\npurposes, such as the German Workingmen's party should be, with\r\nreference to a party which, like the Prussian Progressive party, has\r\nset up as its standard, in the matter of principle, only the\r\nmaintenance of the Prussian constitution, and, as the basis of its\r\nactivity, only the prevention of the one-sided organization of the\r\narmy--which is not even attempted in other German countries; or the\r\ninsistence upon the right of granting appropriations--which is not\r\neven disputed in other German countries.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, it was in no way certain that the Prussian\r\nProgressive party would carry on its conflict with the Prussian\r\nGovernment with that dignity and energy which alone are appropriate\r\nfor the working class, and which alone can count upon its warm\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, it was also not certain that the Prussian\r\nProgressive party, even if it had won a victory over the Prussian\r\nadministration, would use this victory in the interest of the whole\r\npeople, or merely for the maintenance of the privileged position of\r\nthe _bourgeoisie_; in other words, that it would apply this victory\r\ntoward the establishment of the universal equal and direct franchise,\r\nwhich is demanded by democratic principles and by the legitimate\r\ninterests of the working class. In the latter case it evidently could\r\nnot make the slightest claim to any interest on the part of the German\r\nworking class.\r\n\r\nThat is what I should have said to you at that time with reference to\r\nthat suggestion.\r\n\r\nToday I can add furthermore that in the meantime it has been shown by\r\nfacts--a thing which at that time would not have been very difficult\r\nto foresee--that the Progressive party is completely lacking in the\r\nenergy which would have been required to carry to a conclusion, in a\r\ndignified and victorious manner, even such a limited conflict between\r\nitself and the Prussian administration.\r\n\r\nAnd since it continues, in spite of the denial by the Government of\r\nthe right of granting appropriations, to meet and to carry on\r\nparliamentary affairs with the ministry, which has been declared by\r\nthe party itself criminally liable, it humiliates, by this\r\ncontradiction, itself and the people through a lack of force and\r\ndignity without parallel.\r\n\r\nSince it continues to meet, to debate, and to arrange parliamentary\r\naffairs with the administration itself--in spite of the violation of\r\nthe constitution which it has declared to exist--it is a support to\r\nthe administration and aids it in maintaining the appearance of a\r\nconstitutional situation.\r\n\r\nInstead of declaring the sessions of the Chamber closed until the\r\nadministration has declared that it will no longer continue the\r\nexpenditures refused by the Chamber, instead of thus placing upon the\r\nadministration the unavoidable alternative either of respecting the\r\nconstitutional right of the Chamber or of renouncing every appearance\r\nof a constitutional procedure, of ruling openly and without\r\nprevarication as an absolute government, of taking upon itself the\r\ntremendous responsibility of absolutism, and thus of precipitating the\r\ncrisis which must necessarily come, in time, as the result of open\r\nabsolutism, this party by its own action enables the administration to\r\nunite all the advantages of absolute power with all the advantages of\r\nan apparently constitutional procedure.\r\n\r\nAnd since, instead of forcing the administration into open and\r\nunconcealed absolutism and by that action enlightening the people as\r\nto the non-existence of constitutional procedure, it consents to\r\ncontinue to play its part in this comedy of mock constitutionalism, it\r\nhelps maintain an appearance which, like every system of government\r\nbased on appearances, must have a confusing and debasing effect upon\r\nthe intelligence of the people.\r\n\r\nSuch a party has in this way shown that it is, and always will be,\r\nutterly impotent against a determined administration.\r\n\r\nSuch a party has shown that it is for this very reason entirely\r\nincapable of accomplishing even the slightest genuine development of\r\nthe interests of liberty.\r\n\r\nSuch a party has shown that it has no claim to the sympathies of the\r\ndemocratic classes of the population, and that it has no realization\r\nand no understanding of the feeling of political honor which must\r\npermeate the working class.\r\n\r\nSuch a party has, in a word, shown by its action that it is nothing\r\nelse than the resurrection of the unsavory Gotha idea, decked out with\r\na different name.\r\n\r\nI can add today also the following facts: Today, as at that time, I\r\nshould have been obliged to say to you that a party which compels\r\nitself through its dogma of Prussian leadership to see in the Prussian\r\nadministration the chosen Messiah for the German renaissance--while\r\nthere is not a single German administration (even including Hesse),\r\nwhich is more backward than the Prussian in political development,\r\nand while there is hardly a single German government (and\r\nthis includes Austria) which is not far ahead of Prussia--for this\r\nreason alone loses all claim to representing the German working class;\r\nfor such a party shows by this alone a depth of illusion,\r\nself-conceit, and incompetence drunken with the sound of its own\r\nwords, which must dash all hope of expecting from it a real\r\ndevelopment of the liberty of the German people.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said we can now understand definitely what position\r\nthe working class must take in political matters and what attitude\r\ntoward the Progressive party it must maintain.\r\n\r\nThe working class must establish, itself as an independent political\r\nparty, and must make the universal, equal, and direct franchise the\r\nbanner and watchword of this party. Representation of the working\r\nclass in the legislative bodies of Germany--nothing else can satisfy\r\nits legitimate interests from a political point of view. To begin a\r\npeaceful and law-abiding agitation for this by all lawful means is and\r\nmust be, from a political point of view, the programme of the\r\nworkingmen's party.\r\n\r\nIt is self-evident what attitude this workingmen's party is to take\r\ntoward the German Progressive party.\r\n\r\nIt must feel and organize itself everywhere as an independent party\r\ncompletely separate from the latter, although the Progressive party is\r\nto be supported on points and questions in which the interest of the\r\ntwo parties is a common one; it must turn its back decidedly upon the\r\nProgressive party and oppose it whenever it departs from that\r\ninterest, and thus force the Progressive party either to develop\r\nprogressively and to rise above its own level or to sink deeper and\r\ndeeper into the mire of insignificance and weakness in which it\r\nalready stands knee deep; these must be the straightforward tactics of\r\nthe German workingmen's party with reference to the Progressive party.\r\n\r\nSo much as to what you must do from a political point of view.\r\n\r\nNow for the social question which you raise, a question which rightly\r\ninterests you to a still greater extent.\r\n\r\nI have read in the papers, not without a sad smile, that part of the\r\nprogram for your Congress consists in debates concerning freedom of\r\nchoosing places of residence and of employment for the workingman.\r\n\r\nWhat, Gentlemen, are you going to debate about the right of choosing\r\nplaces of residence, the right of settling down anywhere without being\r\nspecially taxed!\r\n\r\nI can answer you on this point with nothing better than Schiller's\r\nepigram:\r\n\r\n   Jahre lang schon bedien' ich mich meiner Nase zum Riechen: Aber\r\n  hab' ich an sie auch ein erweisliches Recht?\r\n\r\n  (Year after year I have used the nose God gave me to smell with:\r\n  But can I legally prove any such right to its use?)\r\n\r\nAnd is not the situation the same as to freedom of employment?\r\n\r\nAll these debates have at least one mistake--they come more than fifty\r\nyears too late. Freedom of moving about and freedom of employment are\r\nthings which nowadays are decreed in a legislative body in silence,\r\nbut no longer debated.\r\n\r\nShould the German working class repeat again the spectacle of\r\nassemblies whose enjoyment consists in giving themselves over to long\r\npurposeless speeches and applauding them? The seriousness and the\r\nenergy of the German working class will know how to protect it from\r\nsuch a pitiable spectacle.\r\n\r\nBut you propose to establish institutions for savings, funds for\r\nretiring pensions, insurance against accidents and sickness? I am\r\nwilling to recognize the relative usefulness of these institutions,\r\nalthough it is a subordinate one and hardly worth notice.\r\n\r\nBut let us make a complete distinction between two questions which\r\nhave absolutely nothing to do with each other.\r\n\r\nIs it your object to make the misery of individual workingmen more\r\nendurable; to counteract the effects of thoughtlessness, sickness, old\r\nage, accidents of all kinds, through which by chance or necessity\r\nindividual workingmen are forced even below the normal condition of\r\nthe working class? For such objects all these institutions are\r\nentirely appropriate means. Only it would not be worth while in that\r\ncase to begin a movement for such a purpose throughout all Germany, to\r\nstir up a general agitation in the whole working class of the nation.\r\nYou must not bring mountains into labor in order that a ridiculous\r\nmouse appear. This so extremely limited and subordinate purpose can\r\nbetter be left to local unions and local organizations, which can\r\nalways handle it far better.\r\n\r\nOr is this your object: To improve the normal condition of the whole\r\nworking class and elevate it above its present level? In truth this is\r\nand must be your purpose, but this sharp line of distinction is\r\nnecessary, which I have drawn between these two objects, which must\r\nnot be confused with each other, in order to show you, better than I\r\ncould through a long exposition, how utterly powerless these\r\ninstitutions are to attain this second object, and therefore how\r\nutterly outside the scope of the present workingmen's movement.\r\n\r\nPermit me to adduce the testimony of a single authority--the admission\r\nof a strict conservative, a strict royalist, Professor Huber--a man\r\nwho has likewise devoted his studies to the social question and the\r\ndevelopment of the workingmen's movement.\r\n\r\nI like to call on the testimony of this man (in the course of this\r\nletter I shall do it now and then again) because he is politically\r\nentirely opposed to me, and in regard to economic questions differs\r\nradically from me, and must accordingly be the best person to remove,\r\nthrough his testimony, the suspicion that the slight advantage which I\r\nattach to those institutions is only the consequence of previously\r\nformed political tendencies; furthermore because Professor Huber,\r\nwho stands as far from liberalism as from my political views, has for\r\nthis very reason the necessary impartiality to make in the field of\r\npolitical economy admissions which are in accordance with the truth;\r\nwhereas all adherents of the liberal school of political economy are\r\nforced to deceive the workingmen, or, in order to deceive them better,\r\nfirst to deceive themselves, in order to bring the facts into harmony\r\nwith their tendencies.\r\n\r\n\"Without underestimating,\" says Professor Huber, \"the relative\r\nusefulness of savings banks, accident and sickness insurance, etc., as\r\nfar as it really goes, these good things may nevertheless carry great\r\nnegative disadvantages with them, in that they stand in the way of\r\nimprovement.\"\r\n\r\nAnd surely never would these negative disadvantages persist and stand\r\nin the way of improvement more than if they took up the attention of\r\nthe great German workingmen's movement, or divided its forces.\r\n\r\nIt was stated in various newspapers, and your letter itself states,\r\nthat you have been recommended from almost all sides to take into\r\nconsideration the Schulze-Delitzsch organizations--credit associations,\r\nraw material associations, and consumers' associations--for the\r\nimprovement of the situation of the working class. Allow me to ask you\r\nfor still closer attention.\r\n\r\nSchulze-Delitzsch may be considered from three points of view: First,\r\nfrom the political point of view, he belongs to the Progressive party,\r\nwhich has already been discussed. Second, he claims to be a political\r\neconomist. In this respect--as a theoretical economist--he stands\r\nentirely on the ground of the Liberal school: he shares all its\r\nmistakes, fallacies, and self-deceptions. The addresses which he has\r\nmade so far to the Berlin workingmen are a striking proof of\r\nthis--misrepresentations of fact and conclusions which in no way\r\nfollow from his premises. However, it will not help your purpose, and\r\nit is not my intention, to go into a criticism here of the economic\r\nviews and the speeches of Schulze-Delitzsch and to point out these\r\nself-deceptions and fallacies which, in matters of theoretical\r\neconomics, he has in common with the whole Liberal school to which he\r\nbelongs. I shall be compelled later, in any case, to come back to the\r\nessential content of these doctrines.\r\n\r\nBut Schulze-Delitzsch has, in the third place, a practical nature,\r\nwhich is of more importance than his theoretical economic viewpoint.\r\nHe is the only member of his party, the Progressive party--and all the\r\nmore credit is due him just for this reason--who has done anything for\r\nthe people. Through his tireless activity, even though he stands alone\r\nat a most unfavorable time, he has become the father and founder of\r\nthe German associations, and so has given an impulse, of the most\r\nfar-reaching importance, to the cause of associations in general, a\r\nservice for which, however I may be opposed to him in theory, I shake\r\nhis hand warmly in spirit as I write this. Truth and justice even\r\ntoward an adversary (and for the working class above all it is\r\nbefitting to take this deeply to heart)--this is the first duty of\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThat the question whether associations are to be understood according\r\nto his or my interpretation is under discussion today is in large part\r\ndue to him, and that is a real service which cannot be too highly\r\nesteemed.\r\n\r\nBut the warmth with which I recognize this service must not prevent us\r\nfrom stating the question with critical clearness: \"Are the\r\nSchulze-Delitzsch associations for credit and for raw materials, and\r\nare the consumers' leagues able to accomplish the improvement of the\r\nsituation of the working class?\"\r\n\r\nThe answer to this question must be a most decided \"no.\" It will be\r\neasy to show this briefly. As to the credit and raw material\r\nassociations, these both agree in that they exist only for those who\r\nare carrying on business on their own account--that is, only for\r\nartisan production. For the working class in the narrower sense--the\r\nhands employed in factory production, who have no business of their\r\nown for which they can use credit and raw materials--neither kind\r\nof association exists. Their help can therefore reach only the artisan\r\nproducers.\r\n\r\nBut, even in this respect, please notice and impress upon your minds\r\ntwo essential circumstances:\r\n\r\nIn the first place the inevitable tendency of our industrialism is to\r\nput factory production more and more from day to day in place of\r\nartisan production, and, in consequence, to drive the workmen of a\r\nconstantly increasing number of trades into the laboring class proper,\r\nwhich finds work in the factories. England and France, which are ahead\r\nof us in economic development, show this in a still greater degree\r\nthan Germany, which is, however, taking tremendous strides in the same\r\ndirection. Your own experience will confirm this sufficiently.\r\n\r\nIt follows from this that the Schulze-Delitzsch credit and raw\r\nmaterial associations, even if they could help the artisans, could be\r\nof advantage only to a very small number of people, a number which is\r\nconstantly decreasing and tends to disappear, through the inevitable\r\ndevelopment of our manufacturing system--people who through the\r\nprogress of our culture are, in constantly increasing numbers, forced\r\ninto the class of workingmen who are not affected by this aid. That\r\nis, nevertheless, only the first conclusion. A second, of still\r\ngreater importance, is the following: In competition with factory\r\nproduction, which is in constantly increasing scope taking the place\r\nof small artisan production, even the artisans who remain in the\r\nlatter are in no way certain of being protected by the credit and raw\r\nmaterial associations. I will again cite Professor Huber as a witness\r\non this point. \"Unfortunately,\" says he, after speaking in praise, as\r\nI have done, of the Schulze-Delitzsch credit and raw material\r\nassociations, \"unfortunately, however, the assumption that the\r\ncompetition of production on a small scale with factory production\r\nwould be made possible seems by no means sufficiently established.\"\r\nBut, better than any testimony, the easily explained internal reasons\r\nof what I say will convince you.\r\n\r\nHow far can the credit associations accomplish the procuring of cheap\r\nand good raw materials? It can place the artisan without capital in a\r\nposition to compete with the artisan who has sufficient small capital\r\nfor his small artisan production. It can, therefore, at most put the\r\nartisan without capital on an equality and in the same situation with\r\nthe master workman who has sufficient capital of his own for his\r\nproduction. But now the fact is just here--even the master workman\r\nwith sufficient capital of his own cannot stand the competition of\r\nlarge capitalists and of factory production, both on account of the\r\nsmaller cost of production of all kinds made possible by the factory\r\nsystem, and on account of the smaller rate of the profit which in\r\nwholesale production is to be reckoned on each single piece, and,\r\nfinally, on account of other advantages connected with it. Since, now,\r\nthe credit and raw material associations can at most bring the small\r\nproducer without capital into the same general position as the one who\r\nhas sufficient capital for his small production, and since the latter\r\ncannot stand the competition of the wholesale production of the\r\nfactories, this result is still more certain for the small producer\r\nwho carries on his business with the help of these associations.\r\n\r\nThese associations can, therefore, with reference to the artisan, only\r\nprolong the death struggle in which artisan production is destined to\r\nsuccumb and give place to factory production; can only increase\r\nthereby the agony of this death struggle and hold back in vain the\r\ndevelopment of our culture--that is the whole result which they have\r\nwith reference to the artisan class, while they do not touch at all\r\nthe real laboring class occupied, in constantly increasing numbers, in\r\nfactory production.\r\n\r\nThere remain for consideration the consumers' associations. The effect\r\nof these would reach the whole working class. They are, however,\r\nutterly incapable of accomplishing the improvement of the situation of\r\nthe working class. This can be shown by three reasons which\r\nessentially, however, form a single one.\r\n\r\n(1) The disadvantage under which the working class labors affects it,\r\nas the economic law which I shall adduce under the second head shows,\r\nas producer, not as consumer. It is therefore an entirely false kind\r\nof aid to try to help the workingman as a consumer instead of helping\r\nhim in the place where the shoe really pinches him--as producer.\r\n\r\nAs consumers, we are, in general, all on the same footing; as before\r\nthe law, so before the salesman, all men are equal--provided only they\r\npay.\r\n\r\nJust for this reason it is true that for the working class, in\r\nconsequence of its limited ability to pay, a special additional evil\r\nhas developed which has nothing to do with the general cancer which is\r\neating into it--the disadvantage of having to supply needs on the\r\nsmallest scale, and so of being exposed to the extortion of the\r\nretailer. Against this the consumers' associations give protection;\r\nbut, aside from the facts that you will see under No. 3 as to how long\r\nthis help can last and when it must cease, this limited help, which\r\ncan for the time being make the sad condition of the workingman a\r\nlittle more endurable, must by no means be mistaken for a means for\r\nthat improvement in the situation of the working class at which the\r\nworkingmen are aiming.\r\n\r\n(2) The relentless economic law which, under present conditions, fixes\r\nthe wages by the law of demand and supply of labor is this: The\r\naverage wage always remains at the lowest point which will maintain\r\nexistence and propagate the race at the standard of living accepted by\r\nthe people. This is the point about which the actual wage always\r\noscillates like a pendulum, without ever rising above or falling below\r\nit for any length of time. It cannot permanently rise above this\r\naverage, for then, through the easier situation of the workingman, an\r\nincrease of the working population and therefore of the supply of\r\nhands would ensue, which would bring the wage again to a point below\r\nits former scale.\r\n\r\nNeither can the wage fall permanently far below what is necessary to\r\nsupport life, for then arise emigration, celibacy, and avoidance of\r\nchild-bearing, and, finally, a reduction of the number of laborers,\r\nwhich then diminishes still more the supply of hands, and therefore\r\nbrings the wage back to its former position again.\r\n\r\nThe real average wage, therefore, is fixed by a constant movement\r\nabout this point of equilibrium, to which it must constantly return,\r\nsometimes rising a little above it (period of prosperity in some or\r\nall industries), sometimes falling a little below it (period of more\r\nor less general distress and industrial crises).\r\n\r\nThe limitation of the average wage to the amount necessary to exist\r\nand propagate the race under the accepted standard of living in a\r\ncommunity--that, I repeat, is the inexorable and cruel law which\r\ndetermines the wage under present conditions.\r\n\r\nThis law can be denied by no one. I could cite as many authorities for\r\nit as there are great and famous names in economic science, and even\r\nfrom the Liberal school itself, for it is just the Liberal school of\r\npolitical economy which has discovered this law and proved it. This\r\ninexorable and cruel law, Gentlemen, you must above all things fix\r\ndeeply in your minds and base upon it all your thinking.\r\n\r\nIn this connection I can give you and the whole working class an\r\ninfallible means of escaping once for all the many attempts to deceive\r\nand mislead you. To everyone who talks to you about the improvement of\r\nthe situation of the working class, you must first put the question:\r\nDoes he acknowledge the existence of this law, or not? If he does not,\r\nyou must say to yourself at the start that this man is either trying\r\nto deceive you, or has the most pitiable ignorance in the science of\r\npolitical economy; for, as I said, there is not a single economist of\r\nthe Liberal school worthy of mention who denies it--Adam Smith as well\r\nas Say, Ricardo as well as Malthus, Bastiat as well as John Stuart\r\nMill, are unanimous in recognizing it. There is an agreement on this\r\npoint among all men of science. And if he who talks to you about the\r\ncondition of workingmen has recognized this law, then ask further: How\r\ndoes he expect to abolish this law? And, if he can give no answer to\r\nthis, then coolly turn your back upon him. He is an idle prattler, who\r\nis trying to deceive you or himself, or dazzle you with empty talk.\r\n\r\nLet us consider for a moment the effect and the nature of this law. It\r\nis stated in other words as follows: From the product of industry\r\nthere is first withdrawn and divided among the workingmen the amount\r\nwhich is required to maintain their existence (wage). The whole\r\nremainder of the product (profit) goes to the employer. It is\r\ntherefore a consequence of this inexorable and cruel law that you (and\r\nfor this reason in my pamphlet on the working class to which you refer\r\nin your letter I have called you the class of the disinherited) are\r\nforever necessarily excluded from the productiveness which increases\r\nin amount through the progress of civilization, i.e., from the\r\nincreased product of industry, from the increased earning power of\r\nyour own work! For you there remain forever the bare necessities of\r\nlife, for the employer everything produced by labor beyond this\r\namount.\r\n\r\nWhen, because of this great advance of productive power (yield of\r\nlabor), many manufactured products become extremely cheap, it may\r\nhappen that through this cheapness you have a certain indirect\r\nadvantage from the increased productiveness of labor--but as\r\nconsumers, not as producers. This advantage in no way affects,\r\nhowever, your activity as producers. It does not affect nor change the\r\nportion of the yield which falls to your share; it affects only your\r\nsituation as consumer and also improves the situation as consumer of\r\nthe employer, and of all men, whether they take part in the work or\r\nnot, and in a much more considerable degree than yours. And this\r\nadvantage, which affects you merely as human beings and not as\r\nworkingmen, again disappears in consequence of this inexorable and\r\ncruel law, which always forces wages in the long run down to the point\r\nof consumption necessary to maintain life.\r\n\r\nNow, however, it may happen that if such an increased yield from labor\r\n(and the extreme cheapness of many products caused thereby), comes\r\nabout very suddenly; if, moreover, it coincides with a prolonged\r\nperiod of increased demand for labor, then these products, which have\r\nbecome disproportionately cheaper, are taken into the body of products\r\nthat are regularly considered in a community as necessities of life.\r\n\r\nThe fact, then, that workingmen and wages are always dancing on the\r\nextreme verge of what suffices, according to the social standard of\r\neach age, for the maintenance of life, sometimes standing a little\r\nabove and sometimes a little below this limit--this never changes. But\r\nthis extreme limit itself may at different ages have changed through\r\nthe coincidence of the above circumstances, and it may therefore\r\nhappen that, if you compare different periods with one another, the\r\nsituation of the working class in the later century or generation\r\n(seeing that now the minimum of necessities of life demanded by custom\r\nis somewhat increased) has improved somewhat in comparison with the\r\nsituation of the working class in the previous century or generation.\r\n\r\nI was obliged to make this slight digression, Gentlemen, even if it is\r\nsomewhat remote from my essential purpose, because this slight\r\nimprovement in the course of centuries and generations is always the\r\npoint to which those go back, who, after Bastiat's example, wish to\r\nthrow dust in your eyes by declamation that is as easy as it is\r\nmeaningless.\r\n\r\nConsider exactly my words, Gentlemen. I say it may, for the above\r\nreasons, occur that the minimum of the necessities of life has risen,\r\nand accordingly the situation of the working class when compared with\r\nthat of former generations is somewhat improved. Whether this is\r\nreally so, whether the whole situation of the working class has\r\nconstantly improved in different centuries is a very difficult and\r\ninvolved problem--a problem for scholars that cannot be treated at all\r\nby those who incessantly fill your ears with statements of how\r\nexpensive cotton was in the last century and how much cotton clothing\r\nis used now, and similar commonplaces which anybody may copy from any\r\nreference book.\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose to enter upon a consideration of this problem\r\nhere. For at this time I must confine myself to giving you not only\r\nwhat is absolutely accepted, but what is also easy to prove. Let us\r\nassume, then, that such an improvement of the minimum of the\r\nnecessities of life, and therefore of the situation of the working\r\nclass, goes on constantly in different generations and different\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nBut I must show you, Gentlemen, that with these commonplaces the real\r\nquestion is taken out of your hands and perverted into a totally\r\ndifferent question.\r\n\r\nIf you speak of the situation of the workingman and its improvement,\r\nyou mean your situation compared with that of your fellow\r\ncitizens--that is, compared with contemporary standards of living.\r\n\r\nAnd they amuse you with alleged comparisons of your condition with the\r\ncondition of workingmen in previous centuries! But what value has the\r\nquestion for you, and what satisfaction can it give you, if, in case\r\nthe minimum of the accepted standard has risen, you are better off\r\ntoday than the workingmen of eighty, two hundred, three hundred years\r\nago? No more than the fully proved fact that you are better off today\r\nthan Hottentots and cannibals.\r\n\r\nEvery satisfaction of human needs depends merely on the relation of\r\nthe means of satisfaction to the necessities of life demanded by the\r\nstandard of living of the time, or, what amounts to the same thing,\r\nupon the surplus of the means over the minimum amount of such\r\nnecessities. An increased minimum of the absolute necessities of life\r\nbrings also sufferings and deprivations which former times never\r\nknew. What deprivation is it to the Hottentot that he cannot buy soap?\r\nWhat deprivation is it to the cannibal if he cannot wear a decent\r\ncoat? What deprivation was it to the workingman, if before the\r\ndiscovery of America, he had no tobacco to smoke, or if, before the\r\ninvention of printing, he could not get a useful book? All human\r\nsuffering and deprivation depend only on the proportion of the means\r\nof satisfaction to the needs and customs of living at a given time.\r\nAll human suffering and deprivation, and all human satisfactions,\r\naccordingly every human condition, is, therefore, to be measured only\r\nby comparison with the situation of other men of the same period and\r\ntheir customary necessities of life. The condition of any class is,\r\ntherefore, to be measured only by its relation to the condition of\r\nother classes at the same period.\r\n\r\nIf it were ever so well established, then, that the standard of the\r\nnecessaries of life has risen through different periods, that\r\nsatisfactions previously unknown have become daily necessities, and\r\nfor this reason deprivations and sufferings not before known have\r\nappeared, your social situation has remained at these different\r\nperiods always the same, always this--that you are standing on the\r\nverge of the usual minimum necessities of life, sometimes a little\r\nabove it, sometimes a little below. Your social position, therefore,\r\nhas remained the same, for this social position is reckoned not by its\r\nrelation to the position of the beast in primeval forests, or negroes\r\nin Africa, or of the serf in the Middle Ages, or the workingmen of\r\neighty years ago, but only by the relation of this position to the\r\nposition of your fellowmen--to the position of other classes in the\r\nsame time.\r\n\r\nAnd instead of taking account of this, instead of considering how this\r\nposition can be improved, and how this cruel law, which constantly\r\nkeeps you at the lowest verge of the necessities of life, can be\r\nchanged, these people amuse themselves by changing the question under\r\nyour nose without your perceiving it, and by entertaining you with\r\nvery dubious historical retrospects as to the situation of the working\r\nclass in previous periods--retrospects which are all the more\r\nquestionable because manufactured products, becoming constantly\r\ncheaper, are far less consumed by the working class than the food\r\nproducts which are their chief articles of consumption, and are in no\r\nway subject to any similar tendency of constantly increasing\r\ncheapness! These are retrospects, finally, which could have value only\r\nif they undertook investigations from every point of view into the\r\ngeneral position of workingmen at different ages--investigations of\r\nthe most difficult nature and to be carried on only with the utmost\r\ncircumspection, investigations for which those who talk to you about\r\nthem have not even the material at hand, and which they, therefore,\r\nshould all the more leave to special scholars.\r\n\r\n(3) Let us now come back from this necessary digression to the\r\nquestion: What influence can the consumers' leagues have upon the\r\nsituation of the working class according to the law of wages discussed\r\nunder No. 2? The answer will be a very easy one.\r\n\r\nAs long as only particular groups of workingmen unite in consumers'\r\nleagues, general wages will not be affected thereby, and the\r\nconsumers' leagues will accordingly furnish, through lower prices, to\r\nthe workingmen who belong to them--as long as this condition\r\nlasts--that minor relief for the oppressed condition discussed and\r\nadmitted under No. 1; but as soon as the consumers' leagues begin to\r\ntake in more and more the whole working class, then, in consequence of\r\nthe above-considered law, the inevitable result will follow that the\r\nwage, because sustenance has become cheaper through the consumers'\r\nleagues, will drop to just that extent.\r\n\r\nThe consumers' leagues can never, even in the slightest degree, help\r\nthe whole working class, and they can furnish to the single groups of\r\nworkingmen who compose them the above-considered aid only as long as\r\nthe example of these workingmen has not been generally followed.\r\nEvery day that the consumers' leagues extend and take in larger\r\nnumbers of the working class, even this slight relief is lost more and\r\nmore even for the workingmen who belong to them, until it drops to\r\nzero at the time when the consumers' leagues have been joined by the\r\nmajority of the whole working class. Can anybody talk seriously of the\r\nworking class turning its attention to a means which gives it no aid\r\nwhatever as a class, and furnishes its individual members this\r\ninconsequential relief only until the time when the class as such has\r\ncompletely, or to a large extent, made use of it? If the German\r\nworking class is willing to enter upon such a treadmill round, the\r\ntime before the real improvement of its position will be long indeed.\r\n\r\nI have now analyzed all the Schulze-Delitzsch organizations and shown\r\nthat they do not and can not help you.\r\n\r\nWhat then? Can not the principle of free individual associations of\r\nworkingmen effect the improvement of the position of the workingmen?\r\n\r\nCertainly it can, but only by its application and extension to the\r\nfield of factory production. To make the working class their own\r\nemployers--that is the means, the only means, by which, as you can see\r\nfor yourself, this inexorable and cruel law which determines wages can\r\nbe abolished. When the working class is its own employer, the\r\ndistinction between wages and profits will disappear, and the total\r\nyield of the industry will take the place, as the reward of labor, of\r\nthe bare living wage.\r\n\r\nThe abolition by this only possible means of that law which under\r\npresent conditions assigns to the workingman his wages--that part of\r\nthe product which is necessary for bare existence--and the whole\r\nremainder to the employer--this is the only real, non-visionary, just\r\nimprovement in the position of the working class.\r\n\r\nBut how? Look at the railroads, machine shops, ship yards, cotton and\r\nwoolen mills, etc., etc., and the millions required for these\r\nestablishments; then look into your own empty pockets and ask\r\nyourself where you will ever get the enormous capital necessary for\r\nthese establishments, and how therefore you can ever make possible the\r\ncarrying on of wholesale production on your own account!\r\n\r\nAnd surely there is no fact more true, more thoroughly established,\r\nthan that you would never accomplish this if you were reduced\r\nexclusively and essentially to your own isolated efforts as\r\nindividuals alone.\r\n\r\nJust for this reason it is the business and the duty of the State to\r\nmake it possible for you to take in hand the great cause of the free,\r\nindividual association of the working class in such a way as to help\r\nits development, and make it its solemn duty to offer you the means\r\nand the opportunity for this association.\r\n\r\nNow, do not allow yourselves to be deceived and misled by the cry of\r\nthose who will tell you that any such intervention by the State\r\ndestroys social incentive. It is not true that I hinder anybody from\r\nclimbing a tower by his own strength if I hand him a ladder or a rope.\r\nIt is not true that the State prevents children from educating\r\nthemselves by their own powers if it provides them with teachers,\r\nschools and libraries. It is not true that I hinder anybody from\r\nplowing a field by his own strength if I give him a plow. It is not\r\ntrue that I hinder anyone from defeating a hostile enemy by his own\r\nstrength if I put a weapon into his hand for the purpose.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is true that now and then someone may have climbed a tower\r\nwithout a rope or a ladder; that individuals have acquired an\r\neducation without teachers, schools, or public libraries; that the\r\npeasants in the Vendée in the wars of the Revolution now and then\r\ndefeated an enemy even without weapons; yet all these exceptions do\r\nnot vitiate the rule--they only prove it; and therefore, although it\r\nis true that under certain special conditions single groups of\r\nworkingmen in England have been able to improve their condition, to a\r\ncertain limited extent, in certain minor branches of wholesale\r\nproduction, by an association based chiefly upon their own\r\nexertions, nevertheless the law stands that the real improvement of\r\nthe situation of the workingman, which he has a just right to demand,\r\nand to demand for the whole working class as such, can be accomplished\r\nonly by this aid of the State. No more should you allow yourselves to\r\nbe misled and deceived by the cry of those who talk about Socialism or\r\nCommunism and try to oppose this demand of yours by such cheap\r\nphrases; but be firmly convinced regarding such people that they are\r\nonly trying to deceive you, or else they themselves do not know what\r\nthey are talking about. Nothing is further from so-called Socialism\r\nand Communism than this demand according to which, if realized, the\r\nworking classes, just as they do today, would maintain their\r\nindividual liberty, individual manner of living, and individual\r\ncompensation for work, and would stand in no different relation to the\r\nState, except that the necessary capital, or credit, for their\r\nassociation would be provided for them by it. But that is exactly the\r\noffice and the destiny of the State--to make easy and provide means\r\nfor the great cultural progress of humanity. This is its ultimate\r\npurpose. For this it exists. It has always served this purpose and\r\nalways must.\r\n\r\nI will give you a single example among hundreds--the canals, highways,\r\npostoffices, steamboat lines, telegraph lines, banking institutions,\r\nagricultural improvements, the introduction of new branches of\r\nindustry, etc., in all of which the intervention of the State was\r\nnecessary--a single example, but one which is worth a hundred others,\r\nand one which is especially near at hand. When railroads were to be\r\nbuilt, in all German as well as in all foreign states except in some\r\nfew isolated lines, the State had to intervene in one way or\r\nanother--chiefly by undertaking to guarantee at least the dividends on\r\nthe stock, in many countries going much further than this.\r\n\r\nThe guarantee of dividends constitutes a one-sided contract of the\r\nrich stockholder with the State--namely, if the new enterprises are\r\nunprofitable, then the loss falls upon the State, and consequently\r\nupon all taxpayers, and, consequently again, especially upon you,\r\nGentlemen, upon the great class of the propertyless. If, on the other\r\nhand, the new enterprises are profitable, then the profit, the large\r\ndividends, come to us, the rich stockholders, and this is not obviated\r\nby the fact that in many countries--for instance in Prussia--certain\r\nvery uncertain advantages for the State in a very distant future are\r\nstipulated, advantages which would result much sooner and much more\r\nabundantly from an association of the working class.\r\n\r\nWithout this intervention of the State, of which, as I have said, the\r\nguarantee of dividends was the weakest form, we should perhaps have no\r\nrailroads on the whole continent today.\r\n\r\nThe fact is also unquestionable that the State was obliged to take\r\nthis step; that the guarantee of dividends was a most pronounced\r\nintervention of the State, that, furthermore, this intervention took\r\nplace in favor of the rich and well-to-do class, which also controls\r\nall capital and all credit, and which therefore could dispense with\r\nthe intervention of the State far more easily than you; and that this\r\nintervention was called for by the whole capitalist class.\r\n\r\nWhy then did not a cry arise at that time against the guarantee of\r\ndividends as an inadmissible intervention of the State? Why was it not\r\nthen discovered that by this guarantee the social incentive of the\r\nrich managers of those stock companies was threatened? Why was this\r\nguarantee of the State not decried as Socialism and Communism?\r\n\r\nBut forsooth, this intervention of the State was in the interests of\r\nthe rich and well-to-do classes of society, and in that case it is\r\nentirely admissible and always has been! It is only when there is any\r\nquestion of intervention in favor of the poverty-stricken classes, in\r\nfavor of the infinite majority, then it is \"pure Socialism and\r\nCommunism.\"\r\n\r\nGive this answer, therefore, to those who wish to raise a howl about\r\nthe inadmissibility of State intervention and the social\r\nindependence endangered by it, and the Socialism and Communism\r\nconcealed in a demand which does not give the slightest occasion for\r\nsuch a howl; and add that since we have, after all, been living in a\r\nstate of Socialism and Communism, as those guarantees of dividends on\r\nrailroads and all the other above-mentioned examples show, we will\r\ncontinue right on in that state.\r\n\r\nA further consideration is that, however great was the advance in\r\ncivilization accomplished by the railroads, it drops to the vanishing\r\npoint in contrast with that mighty advance which would be accomplished\r\nby the association of the working class. Of what avail are all the\r\nhoarded wealth and all the fruits of civilization if they exist for\r\nonly a few, and if the majority of the human race always remains the\r\nTantalus who reaches in vain for these fruits! Worse than\r\nTantalus--for he at least had not produced the fruits for which his\r\nparched lips were condemned to pant in vain! This, the mightiest\r\nadvance of culture which history could know, would justify the helpful\r\nintervention of the State if anything would. The State furthermore can\r\nfurnish this possibility in the easiest manner through the banking\r\ninstitutions (a matter into which I cannot go at length here) without\r\nassuming any greater responsibility than it did by the guarantee of\r\ndividends to the railroads.\r\n\r\nFinally, Gentlemen, what, after all, is the State? (Quotes statistics\r\nwhich may be summed up as follows: In 1851 the percentage of the\r\npopulation of Prussia having more than 1,000 thalers ($750) annual\r\nincome for each family of five persons was less than 1/2 of 1 per cent.;\r\nof those having less than 100 thalers ($75) for such a family was 72-1/4\r\nper cent; those having 100 to 200 thalers, 16-1/4 per cent.; and 200 to\r\n400, 7-1/4 per cent.) The two lowest classes form, therefore, 89 per\r\ncent, of the population; and if you take also the 7% per cent, of the\r\nthird class, who must still be considered in oppressive poverty, you\r\nhave 96-1/4 per cent, of the population in a most needy, unfortunate\r\nsituation. The State, therefore, belongs to you, Gentlemen, to the\r\nsuffering classes--not to us, the upper classes; for it is you who\r\ncompose it. \"What is the State?\" I ask; and you see now from a few\r\nfigures, more vividly than from heavy volumes, the answer. The great\r\nassociation of the poorer classes--yourselves--that is the State.\r\n\r\nAnd why should not your great association have a helpful and fruitful\r\neffect upon your smaller associated groups? This question you may also\r\nput to those who talk to you about the inadmissibility of State\r\nintervention and about Socialism and Communism in the demand for it.\r\n\r\nIf, finally, you desire a special instance of the impossibility of\r\nproducing an improvement in the condition of the working class in any\r\nother way than by free association through this helpful intervention\r\nof the State, you may look to England, that country which is most\r\nfrequently called in evidence to prove the possibility for an\r\nassociation of individual workingmen established purely and\r\nexclusively through their unassisted powers, to improve the condition\r\nof the whole class--England, which in fact must appear best suited,\r\nfor various reasons based on its particular national conditions, to\r\ncarry out this experiment, without, nevertheless, demonstrating\r\nthereby a similar possibility for other countries.\r\n\r\nAnd this special instance comes directly from those English\r\nworkingmen's associations which up to this time have usually been\r\nreferred to as triumphant proof of such an assertion. I speak of the\r\nPioneers of Rochdale. This coöperative society, organized in 1844,\r\nestablished in 1858 a spinning and weaving establishment with a\r\ncapital of £5,500 sterling. According to the statutes of this\r\nassociation, the workmen employed in the factory, whether they were\r\nstockholders in the association or not, drew a profit, in addition to\r\nthe usual wages, equal to that distributed as dividends to the\r\nstockholders--the arrangement having been made that the annual\r\ndividends should be reckoned and distributed both on wages and on\r\ncapital stock. Now the number of stockholders of this factory is one\r\nthousand six hundred, while only five hundred workmen are employed\r\nthere. Accordingly, there exists a large number of stockholders who\r\nare not also workmen in the factory; on the other hand, all the\r\nworkmen are not at the same time stockholders. In consequence of this\r\nan agitation broke out in 1861 among the workingmen stockholders who\r\ndid not work in the factory, and also among those who were both\r\nemployees and stockholders, against the workmen who were not\r\nstockholders receiving a share of the profits. On the part of the\r\nworkingmen stockholders the principle was laid down simply and frankly\r\nthat, according to the usual custom in the whole industrial world, the\r\nclaims of labor were satisfied with the wages and that wages were\r\ndetermined by supply and demand (we have seen above by what law).\r\n\"This fact,\" relates Professor Huber in his report of this affair,\r\n\"was considered valid without further question, as the natural\r\ncondition, needing no further justification, in opposition to a quite\r\nexceptional, arbitrary innovation, even though it were according to\r\nthe statutes.\" Bravely, but only with very dimly understood emotional\r\nreasons, this proposition for the changing of the statutes was opposed\r\nby the original founders and managers of the association. In fact, a\r\nmajority of five-eighths of the workingmen stockholders voted for the\r\nchange of the statutes, taking exactly the same position as the\r\ncapitalist employers, and the change was defeated for the time being\r\nonly because, according to the statutes, a majority of three-fourths\r\nof the votes was required. \"But nobody,\" states Professor Huber, \"is\r\nunaware that the matter is not thereby settled; it is more likely that\r\nstill further serious internal dissensions are to be looked for by\r\nthis association, the outcome of which, perhaps even next year, may\r\nwell be a successful repetition of this attempt--all the more so since\r\nthe opposition is determined to make its influence felt in the\r\nelection of the officials of the association, an election at which the\r\nmajority elects, and through which the controlling offices of the\r\nmanagement may soon be in their hands.\"\r\n\r\nHuber reports further in this matter that most of the associations\r\nproducing on a factory scale have fallen in at the outset with the\r\ngeneral custom, evidently without any further consideration or any\r\nconsciousness of a principle. Only a few have adopted the coöperative\r\nprinciple in favor of labor, and Huber must further admit, although\r\nvery unwillingly and with a heavy heart, for he is a partisan of\r\ncoöperation depending upon individual workingmen alone: \"There is no\r\ndoubt that this question will very soon come to discussion and\r\ndecision in all the producing associations where the opposition of\r\ncapital and labor exists, and that the competition of the industrial\r\nmacrocosm (i.e., the world's industry as a whole) is reproduced in the\r\ncoöperative microcosm (the individual world represented by the\r\nworkingmen's associations).\"\r\n\r\nYou see, Gentlemen, if you reflect about these facts that great\r\nquestions can be solved only in a large way, never in a small way. As\r\nlong as the universal wage is determined by the above-considered law,\r\nthe small associations will not be able to escape the prevailing\r\ninfluence of it; and what does the working class as a whole gain, or\r\nthe workingman as such, whether he works for workingmen employers or\r\nfor capitalist employers? Nothing! You have only scattered the\r\nemployers to whose profit the result of your labor falls. But labor\r\nand the working class are not set free. What does it gain by this! It\r\ngains only depravation, only corruption, which now takes hold of it\r\nand sets workingman as an exploiting employer against workingman. The\r\nemployers have changed in person; but labor, the only source of\r\nproduction, remains, as before, dependent upon the so-called\r\nwage--that is, the maintenance of existence. Under the influence of\r\nthis law the perversion of conceptions is so great that, in our\r\ninstance, even those workingmen stockholders not employed in the\r\nfactory, instead of recognizing that they owe their dividends to the\r\nlabor of the workmen who are employed, and accordingly that it is\r\nthey who draw the profit from the labor of the latter, will, in\r\ndefiance of this, not allow the latter even a share in the product of\r\ntheir own work, not even a share of what labor has a just claim to.\r\nWorkingmen with workingmen's means and employers' hearts--that is the\r\nrepulsive caricature into which those workingmen have been changed.\r\n\r\nAnd now finally one more clear and decisive proof based on these\r\nfacts. You have seen that in that factory of the Pioneers five hundred\r\nworkmen were employed and sixteen hundred workingmen held the stock.\r\nThis much must also be clear to you--that, unless we are willing to\r\nimagine the workmen as rich people (in which case all questions are\r\nsolved--in imagination), the capital necessary for the establishment\r\nof a factory can never be raised from the pockets of the workmen\r\nemployed in it. They will be obliged to take in a much greater number\r\nof other workingmen stockholders, who are not employed in their\r\nfactory. In this respect the proportion in the case of that factory of\r\nthe Pioneers--sixteen hundred stockholders to five hundred workingmen\r\nin the factory (say a proportion of only about three to one)--may be\r\ncalled astonishingly favorable and unusual--as small as is in any way\r\npossible, and to be accounted for partly by the especially fortunate\r\nsituation of the Pioneers, who represent a great exception in the\r\nworking class, partly by the fact that this branch of manufacturing is\r\nfar from being one of those which require the heaviest capitalization,\r\nand partly because this factory is not large enough to count among the\r\nreally large enterprises, for in these the proportion, even in this\r\nbranch of industry, would be a very different one. And, finally, it\r\nmay be added that through the development of industrialism itself, and\r\nthrough the progress of civilization, this proportion must increase\r\ndaily. For the progress of civilization consists in the very fact that\r\nfrom day to day more natural mechanical power--more machinery--takes\r\nthe place of human labor, and that accordingly the proportion of the\r\namount of invested capital to the amount of human labor becomes\r\nlarger; so then, if in that factory of the Pioneers sixteen hundred\r\nstockholders were necessary to raise the capital to employ five\r\nhundred workmen, a proportion of one to three, the proportion among\r\nother workmen in other branches and in larger establishments--and also\r\nin consideration of the daily advance of civilization--will be one to\r\nfour, one to five, six, eight, ten, twenty, etc. However, let us keep\r\nthis proportion of one to three. To establish a factory in which five\r\nhundred workmen find employment, I need sixteen hundred workingmen\r\nstockholders in order to have the necessary capital. Very well: as\r\nlong as I try to establish one, two, three, etc., factories, there is\r\nno difficulty in theory (always in theory, Gentlemen--in imagination),\r\nI call to aid (always in theory) the three, four, etc., times the\r\nnumber of workingmen stockholders. But if I extend this association to\r\nthe whole working class--and their cause, not that of individuals who\r\nwish to improve their position, is in question here--if in course of\r\ntime I wish to establish factories enough to occupy the whole working\r\nclass, where shall I get the three, five, ten, twenty-fold number of\r\nthe whole working class who, as workingmen stockholders, must stand\r\nbehind the workmen occupied in the factories in order to establish\r\nthese factories?\r\n\r\nYou see then that it is a mathematical impossibility to free the\r\nworking class in this way--by the exertions of its members as merely\r\nsingle individuals; that only very confused, uncritical imaginations\r\ncan lend themselves to these illusions, and that the only way to this\r\nend, the only way for the abolition of that cruel law of wages to\r\nwhich the working class is bound as to a martyr's stake, is the\r\nencouragement and development of free, individual, coöperative\r\nassociations of workingmen through the helping hand of the State. The\r\nmovement for workingmen's associations founded upon the purely\r\natomistic, isolated power of individual workingmen had only the\r\nvalue--and this, to be sure, is an enormous one--of showing\r\ndefinitely the practical way in which this liberation can take place,\r\nof giving brilliant, practical proofs for overcoming all real or\r\nassumed doubt of its practical feasibility, and, in just that way, of\r\nmaking it the urgent duty of the State to lend its supporting hand to\r\nthose highest cultural interests of humanity. At the same time I have\r\nalready proved that the State is essentially nothing else than the\r\ngreat association of the working class, and that therefore the help\r\nand fostering care through which the State made possible those smaller\r\nassociations would be nothing else than the legitimate social\r\ninitiative, absolutely natural and lawful, which the working classes\r\nput forth for themselves as a great association, for their members as\r\nsingle individuals. Once more then: free individual association of the\r\nworkingmen, but such association made possible by the supporting and\r\nfostering hand of the State--that is the workingmen's only way out of\r\nthe wilderness.\r\n\r\nBut how shall the State be enabled to make this intervention? The\r\nanswer must be immediately evident to you all: it will be possible\r\nonly through universal and direct suffrage. When the legislative\r\nbodies of Germany are based on universal and direct suffrage, then,\r\nand only then, will you be able to prevail upon the State to undertake\r\nthis duty.\r\n\r\nThen this demand will be brought forward in the legislative bodies;\r\nthen the limits and the forms and the means of this intervention will\r\nbe discussed by reason and science; and then--be assured of\r\nthis!--those men who understand your situation and are devoted to your\r\ncause, armed with the glittering steel of science, will stand at your\r\nside and protect your interests; then you, the propertyless class of\r\nsociety, will have only yourselves and your own unwise choices to\r\nblame if the representatives of your class remain in a minority.\r\n\r\nThe universal and direct franchise is, as now appears, not merely your\r\npolitical principle--it is your social principle, the fundamental\r\nprinciple of all social advancement. It is the only means for\r\nimproving the material condition of the working class. But how can\r\nthey accomplish the introduction of the universal and direct\r\nfranchise? For an answer, look to England! The great agitation of the\r\nEnglish people against the corn laws lasted for more than five years,\r\nbut then they had to go--abolished by the Tory ministry itself.\r\n\r\nOrganize yourselves as a general workingmen's union for the purpose\r\nof a lawful and peaceable, but untiring, unceasing agitation for the\r\nintroduction of universal and direct suffrage in all German states.\r\nFrom the moment when this union includes even one hundred thousand\r\nGerman workingmen, it will be a force with which everybody must\r\nreckon. Send abroad this call into every workshop, every village,\r\nevery cottage. Let the city workingmen pass on their higher standard\r\nof judgment and education to the country workers. Debate, discuss,\r\neverywhere, daily, untiringly, incessantly, as was done in that great\r\nEnglish agitation against the corn laws, in peaceable public assemblies\r\nas well as in private meetings, the necessity of the universal and\r\ndirect franchise. The more the echo of your voice resounds in the ears\r\nof millions, the more irresistible its force will be.\r\n\r\nEstablish financial committees, to which every member of the German\r\nworkingmen's union must contribute, and to which your plans for\r\norganization can be submitted.\r\n\r\nWith these contributions establish funds which, in spite of the\r\nsmallness of the individual amounts, would form a tremendous financial\r\npower for the purpose of agitation. A weekly contribution of only one\r\nsilver groschen each from one hundred thousand members of the union\r\nwould produce over one hundred and sixty thousand thalers yearly.\r\nEstablish newspapers which would daily bring forward this demand and\r\nprove that it is founded upon social conditions; send out by the same\r\nmeans pamphlets for the same purpose; employ with the resources of\r\nthis union agents to carry this same view into every corner of the\r\nland, to arouse with the same call the heart of every workingman, of\r\nevery cotter and plowman; indemnify from the resources of this union\r\nall those workingmen who suffer injury and persecution on account of\r\ntheir activity in this cause.\r\n\r\nRepeat daily, unceasingly, this same call. The more it is repeated,\r\nthe more it will spread and the mightier will become its power. The\r\nwhole art of practical success consists in concentrating all efforts\r\nat all times upon one point, and that the most important one, looking\r\nneither to the right nor to the left. Look you neither to the right\r\nnor to the left; be deaf to everything which does not mean universal\r\nand direct suffrage, to everything which is not connected with it, or\r\nable to lead to it.\r\n\r\nIf you have really spread this call, as you can do within a few years,\r\nthrough the 89 to 96 per cent. of the total population which, as I\r\nhave shown you, constitutes the poor and propertyless classes of\r\nsociety, then your will can no longer be resisted--depend upon that!\r\nQuarrels and feuds may exist about political rights between the\r\ngovernment and the capitalist. You may even be denied political powers\r\nand therefore universal suffrage, because of the luke-warmness with\r\nwhich political rights are regarded; but universal suffrage, which 89\r\nto 96 per cent. of the population regard as a life question, and\r\ntherefore spread with the warmth of life through the whole national\r\nbody--depend upon it, Gentlemen, there is no power which can resist\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThis is the banner which you must raise. This is the standard under\r\nwhich you will conquer. There is no other for you.",
