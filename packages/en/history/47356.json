PROLEGOMENA.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. 1.--_On the State of the Homeric question._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are told that, in an ancient city, he who had a new law to propose\r\nmade his appearance, when about to discharge that duty, with a halter\r\nround his neck. It might be somewhat rigid to re-introduce this\r\npractice in the case of those who write new books on subjects, with\r\nwhich the ears at least of the world are familiar. But it is not\r\nunreasonable to demand of them some such reason for their boldness as\r\nshall be at any rate presumably related to public utility. Complying\r\nwith this demand by anticipation, I will place in the foreground an\r\nexplicit statement of the objects which I have in view.\r\n\r\nThese objects are twofold: firstly, to promote and extend the fruitful\r\nstudy of the immortal poems of Homer; and secondly, to vindicate for\r\nthem, in an age of discussion, their just degree both of absolute and,\r\nmore especially, of relative critical value. My desire is to indicate\r\nat least, if I cannot hope to establish, their proper place, both\r\nin the discipline of classical education, and among the materials of\r\nhistorical inquiry. When the world has been hearing and reading Homer,\r\nand talking and writing about him, for nearly three thousand years,\r\nit may seem strange thus to imply that he is still an ‘inheritor of\r\nunfulfilled renown,’[2] and not yet in full possession of his lawful\r\nthrone. He who seems to impeach the knowledge and judgment of all\r\nformer ages, himself runs but an evil chance, and is likely to be found\r\nguilty of ignorance and folly. Such, however, is not my design. There\r\nis no reason to doubt that Greece\r\n\r\n    Dum fortuna fuit\r\n\r\nknew right well her own noble child, and paid him all the homage that\r\neven he could justly claim. But in later times, and in most of the\r\nlands where he is a foreigner, I know not if he has ever yet enjoyed\r\nhis full honour from the educated world. He is, I trust, coming to it;\r\nand my desire is to accelerate, if ever so little, the movement in that\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nAs respects the first portion of the design which has been described,\r\nI would offer the following considerations. The controversy _de vitâ\r\net sanguine_, concerning the personality of the poet, and the unity\r\nand antiquity of the works, has been carried on with vigour for near a\r\ncentury. In default of extraneous testimony, the materials of warfare\r\nhave been sedulously sought in the rich mine which was offered by the\r\npoems themselves. There has resulted from this cause a closer study of\r\nthe text, and a fuller development of much that it contains, than could\r\nhave been expected in times when the student of Homer had only to enjoy\r\nhis banquet, and not to fight for it before he could sit down. It is\r\nnot merely, however, in warmth of feeling that he may have profited;\r\nthe Iliad and the Odyssey have been, from the absolute necessity of the\r\ncase, put into the witness-box themselves, examined and cross-examined\r\nin every variety of temper, and thus, in some degree at least, made\r\nto tell their own story. The result has been upon the whole greatly\r\nin their favour. The more they are searched and tested, the more does\r\nit appear they have to say, and the better does their testimony hang\r\ntogether. The more plain does it become, that the arguments used on the\r\nside of scepticism and annihilation are generally of a technical and\r\nexternal character, and the greater is the mass of moral and internal\r\nevidence continually accumulated against them. In consequence, there\r\nhas set in a strong reaction among scholars, even in Germany (in\r\nEngland the destructive theories never greatly throve), on behalf of\r\nthe affirmative side of all, or nearly all, the main questions which\r\nhad been raised. Mure,[3] the last and perhaps most distinguished of\r\nBritish writers on this subject, has left the debate in such a state\r\nthat those who follow him may be excused, and may excuse their readers,\r\nfrom systematic preliminary discussion; and may proceed upon the\r\nassumption that the Iliad and Odyssey are in their substance the true\r\noffspring of the heroic age itself, and are genuine gifts not only of a\r\nremote antiquity but of a designing mind; as well as that he, to whom\r\nthat mind belonged, has been justly declared by the verdict of all ages\r\nto be the patriarch of poets. These controversies have been ‘bolted to\r\nthe bran;’ for us at least they are all but dead, and to me it seems\r\nlittle better than lost time to revive them.\r\n\r\nHaving then at the present day the title to the estate in some degree\r\nsecured from litigation, we may enter upon the fruition of it, and with\r\nall the truer zest on account of the conflict, which has been long and\r\nkeenly fought, and in the general opinion fairly won. It now becomes\r\nall those, who love Homer, to prosecute the sure method of inquiry\r\nand appreciation by close, continued, comprehensive study of the\r\ntext; a study of which it would be easy to prove the need, by showing\r\nhow inaccurately the poems are often cited in quarters, to which the\r\ngeneral reader justifiably looks for trustworthy information. To this\r\nwe have been exhorted by the writer already named:[4] and we have\r\nonly to make his practice our model. That something has already been\r\nattained, we may judge by comparison. Let us take a single instance.\r\nIn the year 1735 was published ‘Blackwell’s Inquiry into the Life and\r\nWritings of Homer.’ Bentley, as it would appear from Bishop Monk’s\r\nLife[5] of that extraordinary scholar, was not to be taken in by a\r\nbook of this kind: but such men as Bentley are not samples of their\r\ntime, they are living symbols and predictions of what it will require\r\nyears or generations to accomplish. We may rather judge of the common\r\nimpression made by this book, from the Notes to Pope’s Preface to the\r\nIliad, where Warton[6] extols it as ‘a work that abounds in curious\r\nresearches and observations, and places Homer in a new light.’ But no\r\nreader of Homer, in our own time, would really, I apprehend, be the\r\npoorer, if every copy of it could be burned.\r\n\r\nSince the time of Blackwell’s work, important aids have been gained\r\ntowards the study of Homer, by the researches of travellers, fruitful\r\nin circumstantial evidence, and by the discovery of the Venetian\r\nScholia, as well as by the persevering labours of modern critics.\r\nWe have been gradually coming to understand that these precious\r\nworks, which may have formed the delight of our boyhood, have also\r\nbeen designed to instruct our maturer years. I do not here refer\r\nto their poetic power and splendour only. It is now time that we\r\nshould recognise the truth, that they constitute a vast depository of\r\nknowledge upon subjects of deep interest, and of boundless variety;\r\nand that this is a knowledge, too, which can be had from them alone.\r\nIt was the Greek mind transferred, without doubt, in some part through\r\nItaly, but yet only transferred, and still Greek both in origin and\r\nin much of its essence, in which was shaped and tempered the original\r\nmould of the modern European civilization. I speak now of civilization\r\nas a thing distinct from religion, but destined to combine and coalesce\r\nwith it. The power derived from this source was to stand in subordinate\r\nconjunction with the Gospel, and to contribute its own share towards\r\nthe training of mankind. From hence were to be derived the forms and\r\nmaterials of thought, of imaginative culture, of the whole education\r\nof the intellectual soul, which, when pervaded with an higher life from\r\nthe Divine fountain, was thus to be secured from corruption, and both\r\nplaced and kept in harmony with the world of spirits.\r\n\r\nThis Greek mind, which thus became one of the main factors of the\r\ncivilized life of Christendom, cannot be fully comprehended without the\r\nstudy of Homer, and is nowhere so vividly or so sincerely exhibited as\r\nin his works. He has a world of his own, into which, upon his strong\r\nwing, he carries us. There we find ourselves amidst a system of ideas,\r\nfeelings, and actions, different from what are to be found anywhere\r\nelse; and forming a new and distinct standard of humanity. Many among\r\nthem seem as if they were then shortly about to be buried under a mass\r\nof ruins, in order that they might subsequently reappear, bright and\r\nfresh for application, among later generations of men. Others of them\r\nalmost carry us back to the early morning of our race, the hours of its\r\ngreater simplicity and purity, and more free intercourse with God. In\r\nmuch that this Homeric world exhibits, we see the taint of sin at work,\r\nbut far, as yet, from its perfect work and its ripeness; it stands\r\nbetween Paradise and the vices of later heathenism, far from both,\r\nfrom the latter as well as from the former; and if among all earthly\r\nknowledge, the knowledge of man be that which we should chiefly court,\r\nand if to be genuine it should be founded upon experience, how is it\r\npossible to over-value this primitive representation of the human race\r\nin a form complete, distinct, and separate, with its own religion,\r\nethics, policy, history, arts, manners, fresh and true to the standard\r\nof its nature, like the form of an infant from the hand of the Creator,\r\nyet mature, full, and finished, in its own sense, after its own laws,\r\nlike some masterpiece of the sculptor’s art.\r\n\r\nThe poems of Homer never can be put in competition with the Sacred\r\nWritings of the Old Testament, as regards the one invaluable code\r\nof Truth and Hope that was contained in them. But while the Jewish\r\nrecords exhibit to us the link between man and the other world in the\r\nearliest times, the poems of Homer show us the being, of whom God was\r\npleased to be thus mindful, in the free unsuspecting play of his actual\r\nnature. The patriarchal and Jewish dispensations created, and sustained\r\nthrough Divine interposition, a state of things essentially special\r\nand exceptional: but here first we see our kind set to work out for\r\nitself, under the lights which common life and experience supplied, the\r\ndeep problem of his destiny. Nor is there, perhaps, any more solemn and\r\nmelancholy lesson, than that which is to be learned from its continual\r\ndownward course. If these words amount to a begging of the question,\r\nat least, it is most important for us to know whether the course was\r\ncontinually downwards; whether, as man enlarged his powers and his\r\nresources, he came nearer to, or went farther from his happiness and\r\nhis perfection. Now, this inquiry cannot, for Europe and Christendom at\r\nleast, be satisfactorily conducted, except in commencing from the basis\r\nwhich the Homeric poems supply. As regards the great Roman people,\r\nwe know nothing of them, which is at once archaic and veracious. As\r\nregards the Greeks, it is Homer that furnishes the point of origin\r\nfrom which all distances are to be measured. When the historic period\r\nbegan, Greece was already near its intellectual middle-age. Little can\r\nbe learned of the relative movements of our moral and our mental nature\r\nseverally, from matching one portion of that period with another, in\r\ncomparison with what we may gather from bringing into neighbourhood and\r\ncontrast the pristine and youthful Greece of Homer on the one hand,\r\nand, on the other, the developed and finished Greece of the age of the\r\ntragedians or the orators.\r\n\r\nThe Mosaic books, and the other historical books of the Old Testament,\r\nare not intended to present, and do not present, a picture of human\r\nsociety, or of our nature drawn at large. Their aim is to exhibit it\r\nin one master-relation, and to do this with effect, they do it, to a\r\ngreat extent, exclusively. The Homeric materials for exhibiting that\r\nrelation are different in kind as well as in degree: but as they paint,\r\nand paint to the very life, the whole range of our nature, and the\r\nentire circle of human action and experience, at an epoch much more\r\nnearly analogous to the patriarchal time than to any later age, the\r\npoems of Homer may be viewed, in the philosophy of human nature, as the\r\ncomplement of the earliest portion of the Sacred Records.\r\n\r\nAlthough the close and systematic study of the Homeric text has begun\r\nat a date comparatively recent, yet the marked development of riches\r\nfrom within which it has produced, has already been a real, permanent,\r\nand vast addition to the mental wealth of mankind. We can now better\r\nunderstand than formerly much that relates to the fame and authority\r\nof this great poet in early times, and that we may formerly have\r\ncontemplated as fanciful, exaggerated, or unreal. It was, we can now\r\nsee, with no idle wonder that, while Greek philosophers took texts\r\nfrom him so largely in their schools, the Greek public listened to his\r\nstrains in places of thronged resort, and in their solemn assemblages,\r\nand Greek warriors and statesmen kept him in their cabinets and under\r\ntheir pillows; and, for the first and last time in the history of the\r\nworld, made the preservation of a poet’s compositions an object of\r\npermanent public policy.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Revised and enlarged from the ‘Essay on the place of Homer in\r\nClassical education and in Historical inquiry,’ which was contained in\r\nthe ‘Oxford Essays’ for 1857, published by Mr. J. W. Parker.\r\n\r\n[2] Shelley’s Adonais.\r\n\r\n[3] While speaking of this eminent labourer in the field of Homeric\r\ninquiry, I must not pass by the sympathising spirit and imagination\r\nof Mr. H. Nelson Coleridge, the admirably turned Homeric tone of the\r\nballads of Dr. Maginn, or the valuable analysis contained in the\r\nuncompleted ‘Homerus’ of Archdeacon Williams. But of all the criticisms\r\non Homer which I have ever had the good fortune to read, in our own or\r\nany language, the most vivid and entirely genial are those found in\r\nthe ‘Essays Critical and Imaginative’ of the late Professor Wilson.\r\nIn that most useful, and I presume I may add standard, work, Smith’s\r\n‘Dictionary of Classical Biography and Mythology,’ I am sorry to find\r\nthat the important article Homerus, by Dr. Ihne, though it has the\r\nmerit of presenting the question in a clear light, yet is neither\r\nuniformly accurate in its references to the text of Homer, nor at all\r\nin conformity with the prevailing state at least of English opinion\r\nupon the controversy.\r\n\r\n[4] Mure’s History of Grecian Literature, vol. i. p. 10.\r\n\r\n[5] 4to ed. p. 622, n.\r\n\r\n[6] Warton’s Pope, vol. iv. p. 371, n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. 2.--_The Place of Homer in Classical Education._\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, from these considerations may arise the important question, Does\r\nHomer hold in our English education the place which is his due, and\r\nwhich it would be for our advantage to give him? An immense price is\r\npaid by the youth of this country for classical acquirement. It is the\r\nmain effort of the first spring-tide of their intellectual life. It is\r\nto be hoped that this price will continue to be paid by all those, who\r\nare qualified to profit by the acquisition; and that though of other\r\nknowledge much more will hereafter be gained than heretofore, yet of\r\nthis there shall on no account be less. Still, viewing the greatness\r\nof the cost, which consists in the chief energies of so many precious\r\nyears, it highly concerns us to see that what we get in return is good\r\nboth in measure and in quality. What, then, are the facts with respect\r\nto the study of Homer in England at the present day?\r\n\r\nI must here begin with the apology due from one who feels himself to\r\nbe far from perfectly informed on the case of which it is necessary to\r\ngive an outline. But even if I understate both the amount of Homeric\r\nstudy, and its efficiency, there will, I am confident, remain, after\r\nevery due allowance shall have been made for error, ample room for\r\nthe application of the general propositions that I seek to enforce.\r\nThey are these: that the study of Homer in our Universities is as yet\r\nbelow the point to which it is desirable that it should be carried, and\r\nthat the same study, carried on at our public Schools, neither is,\r\nnor can be made, a fitting substitute for what is thus wanting at the\r\nUniversities.\r\n\r\nIn my own day, at Oxford, now a full quarter of a century ago, the\r\npoems of Homer were read chiefly by way of exception, and in obedience\r\nto the impulse of individual tastes. They entered rather materially\r\ninto those examinations by which scholarship was principally to be\r\ntested, but they scarcely formed a substantive or recognised part\r\nof the main studies of the place, which were directed to the final\r\nexamination in the Schools for the Bachelor’s degree. I do not\r\nrecollect to have ever heard at that time of their being used as the\r\nsubject matter of the ordinary tutorial lectures; and if they were so,\r\nthe case was certainly a rare one. Although the late Dr. Gaisford, in\r\nthe estimation of many the first scholar of his age, during his long\r\ntenure of the Deanery of Christ Church, gave the whole weight of his\r\nauthority to the recommendation of Homeric study, it did not avail\r\nto bring about any material change. The basis of the Greek classical\r\ninstruction lay chiefly in the philosophers, historians, and later\r\npoets; and when Homer was, in the academical phrase, ‘taken up,’ he was\r\nemployed ornamentally, and therefore superficially, and was subjected\r\nto no such searching and laborious methods of study as, to the great\r\nhonour and advantage of Oxford, were certainly applied to the authors\r\nwho held the first rank in her practical system. I am led to believe\r\nthat the case at Cambridge was not essentially different, although,\r\nfrom the greater relative space occupied there by examinations in pure\r\nscholarship, it is probable that Homer may, under that aspect at least,\r\nhave attracted a greater share of attention.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, the University of Oxford brought to maturity, in the\r\nyear 1850, a new Statute of examinations, efforts were made to promote\r\nan extended study of Homer. Those efforts, it happily appears, have\r\nproduced a considerable effect. Provision was made by that statute for\r\ndividing the study of the poets from the philosophical and historical\r\nstudies, and for including the former in the intermediate, or, as it is\r\ntermed, ‘first public’ examination, while both the latter were reserved\r\nfor the final trial, with which the period of undergraduateship is\r\nusually wound up. All candidates for honours in this intermediate\r\nexamination are now required to present not less than twelve Books\r\nof Homer on the list of works in which they are to be examined. And\r\nI understand that he has also taken his place among the regular\r\nsubjects of the tutorial lectures. This is a great sign of progress;\r\nand it may confidently be hoped that, under these circumstances, Homer\r\nwill henceforward hold a much more forward position in the studies\r\nof Oxford. There remains something to desire, and that something, I\r\nshould hope, any further development of the Examination Statute of the\r\nUniversity will supply.\r\n\r\nIt is clear, that the study of this great master should not be confined\r\nto preparation for examinations which deal principally with language,\r\nor which cannot enter upon either primitive history, or philosophy, or\r\npolicy, or religion, except by way of secondary illustration. Better\r\nfar that he should be studied simply among the poets, than that he\r\nshould not be studied at all. But as long as he is read only among the\r\npoets, he cannot, I believe, be read effectively for the higher and\r\nmore varied purposes of which Homeric study is so largely susceptible.\r\n\r\nThe grammar, metre, and diction, the tastes, the whole poetic handling\r\nand qualities of Homer, do, indeed, offer an assemblage of objects for\r\nour consideration at once and alike singular, attractive, extended,\r\nand profitable. The extraneous controversies with which his name has\r\nso long been associated as to his personality and date, and as to the\r\nunity and transmission of his works, although they are for us, I trust,\r\nin substance nearly decided, yet are not likely to lose their literary\r\ninterest, were it only on account of the peculiarly convenient and\r\nseductive manner in which they open up many questions of primitive\r\nresearch; presenting these questions to us, as they do, not in the\r\ndull garb pieced out of antiquarian scraps, but alive, and in the full\r\nmovement of vigorous debate. All this is fit for delightful exercise;\r\nbut much more lies behind.\r\n\r\nThere is an inner Homeric world, of which his verse is the tabernacle\r\nand his poetic genius the exponent, but which offers in itself a\r\nspectacle of the most profound interest, quite apart from him who\r\nintroduces us to it, and from the means by which we are so introduced.\r\nThis world of religion and ethics, of civil policy, of history and\r\nethnology, of manners and arts, so widely severed from all following\r\nexperience, that we may properly call them palæozoic, can hardly be\r\nexamined and understood by those, who are taught to approach Homer as a\r\npoet only.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the transcendency of his poetical distinctions has tended to\r\novershadow his other claims and uses. As settlers in the very richest\r\nsoils, saturated with the fruits which they almost spontaneously yield,\r\nrarely turn their whole powers to account, so they, that are taught\r\nsimply to repair to Homer for his poetry, find in him, so considered,\r\nsuch ample resources for enjoyment, that, unless summoned onwards by a\r\ndistinct and separate call, they are little likely to travel further.\r\nIt was thus that Lord Bacon’s brilliant fame as a philosopher diverted\r\npublic attention from his merits as a political historian.[7] It was\r\nthus, to take a nearer instance, that most readers of Dante, while\r\nsubmitting their imaginations to his powerful sway, have been almost\r\nwholly unconscious that they were in the hands of one of the most\r\nacute and exact of metaphysicians, one of the most tender, earnest,\r\nand profound among spiritual writers. Here, indeed, the process has\r\nbeen simpler in form; for the majority, at least, of readers, have\r\nstopped with the striking, and, so to speak, incorporated imagery of\r\nthe ‘Inferno,’ and have not so much as read the following, which are\r\nalso the loftier and more ethereal, portions of the ‘Divina Commedia.’\r\nIt may be enough for Homer’s fame, that the consent of mankind has\r\nirrevocably assigned to him a supremacy among poets, without real\r\ncompetitors or partners, except Dante and Shakspeare; and that,\r\nperhaps, if we take into view his date, the unpreparedness of the\r\nworld for works so extraordinary as his, the comparative paucity of\r\nthe traditional resources and training he could have inherited, he\r\nthen becomes the most extraordinary, as he is also the most ancient,\r\nphenomenon in the whole history of purely human culture. In particular\r\npoints he appears to me, if it be not presumptuous to say so much, to\r\nremain to this day unquestionably without an equal in the management of\r\nthe poetic art. If Shakspeare be supreme in the intuitive knowledge of\r\nhuman nature and in the rapid and fertile vigour of his imagination, if\r\nDante have the largest grasp of the ‘height and depth’ of all things\r\ncreated, if he stand first in the power of exhibiting and producing\r\necstasy, and in the compressed and concentrated energy[8] of thought\r\nand feeling, Homer, too, has his own peculiar prerogatives. Among them\r\nmight perhaps be placed the faculty of high oratory; the art of turning\r\nto account epithets and distinctive phrases; the production of indirect\r\nor negative effects; and the power of creating and sustaining dramatic\r\ninterest without the large use of wicked agents, in whom later poets\r\nhave found their most indispensable auxiliaries. But all this is not\r\nenough for us who read him. If the works of Homer are, to letters and\r\nto human learning, what the early books of Scripture are to the entire\r\nBible and to the spiritual life of man; if in them lie the beginnings\r\nof the intellectual life of the world, then we must still recollect\r\nthat that life, to be rightly understood, should be studied in its\r\nbeginnings. There we may see in simple forms what afterwards grew\r\ncomplex, and in clear light what afterwards became obscure; and there\r\nwe obtain starting-points, from which to measure progress and decay\r\nalong all the lines upon which our nature moves.\r\n\r\nOver and above the general plea here offered for the study of Homer\r\nunder other aspects than such as are merely poetical, there is\r\nsomething to be said upon his claims in competition with other, and\r\nespecially with other Greek poets. The case of the Latin poets, nearer\r\nto us historically, more accessible in tongue, more easily retained in\r\nthe mind under the pressure of after-life, more readily available for\r\nliterary and social purposes, must stand upon its own grounds.\r\n\r\nIn considering what is the place due to Homer in education, we cannot\r\naltogether exclude from view the question of comparative value, as\r\nbetween him and his now successful and overbearing rivals, the Greek\r\ntragedians. For we are not to expect that of the total studies, at\r\nleast of Oxford and Cambridge, any larger share, speaking generally,\r\ncan hereafter be given to Greek poetry, as a whole, than has heretofore\r\nbeen so bestowed. It is rather a question whether there should be some\r\nshifting, or less uniformity, in the present distribution of time and\r\nlabour, as among the different claimants within that attractive field.\r\n\r\nI do not dispute the merits of the tragedians as masters in their noble\r\nart. As long as letters are cultivated among mankind, for so long\r\ntheir honours are secure. I do not question the advantage of studying\r\nthe Greek language in its most fixed and most exact forms, which they\r\npresent in perfection; nor their equal, at least, if not greater value\r\nthan Homer, as practical helps and models in Greek composition. But,\r\nafter all allowances on these, or on any other score, they cannot,\r\neven in respect of purely poetic titles, make good a claim to that\r\npreference over Homer, which they have, nevertheless, extensively\r\nenjoyed. I refer far less to Æschylus than to the others, because\r\nhe seems more to resemble Homer not only in majesty, but in nature,\r\nreality, and historical veracity: and far less again to Sophocles, than\r\nto Euripides. But it may be said of them, generally, though in greatly\r\ndiffering degrees, that while with Homer everything is pre-eminently\r\nfresh and genuine, with them, on the contrary, this freshness and\r\ngenuineness, this life-likeness, are for the most part wanting. We\r\nare reminded, by the matter itself, of the masks in which the actors\r\nappeared, of the mechanical appliances with the aid of which they\r\nspoke. The very existence of the word, ἐκτραγῳδεῖν,[9] and other[10]\r\nlike compounds, shows us that, in the Greek tragedy, human nature and\r\nhuman life were not represented at large; they were got up; they were\r\nplaced in the light of certain peculiar ideas, with a view to peculiar\r\neffects. The dramas were magnificent and also instructive pictures, but\r\nthey taught, as it were, certain set lessons only: they were pictures\r\n_sui generis_, pictures marked with a certain mannerism, pictures\r\nin which the artist follows a standard which is neither original,\r\nnor general, nor truly normal. Let us try the test of an expression\r\nsomewhat kindred in etymology: such a word as ἐξομηροῦν would carry\r\nupon its face a damning solecism. Again, let us mark the difference\r\nwhich was observed by the sagacity of Aristotle.[11] With the speeches\r\nin the Iliad, he compares the speeches in the tragedians; those most\r\nremarkable and telling compositions, which we have occasion so often to\r\nadmire in Euripides. But, as he says, the Characters of the ancients,\r\ndoubtless meaning Homer, speak πολιτικῶς, those of the moderns,\r\nῥητορικῶς. I know no reason why the speeches of Achilles should not be\r\ncompared with the finest passages of Demosthenes: but no one could make\r\nsuch a comparison between Demosthenes and the speeches, though they are\r\nmost powerful and effective harangues, which we find in the Troades,\r\nor the Iphigenia in Aulide. This contrast of the earnest and practical\r\nwith the artificial, runs, more or less, along the whole line which\r\ndivides Homer from the tragedians, particularly from Euripides.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the case in another point of view, and estimate these\r\npoets with reference to what they tell, and not to the mere manner of\r\ntheir telling it, the argument for assigning to Homer a greater share\r\nof the attention of our youth, becomes yet stronger. For it must be\r\nadmitted that the tragedians, especially the two later of the three,\r\nteach us but very little of the Greek religion, history, manners,\r\narts, or institutions. At the period when they wrote, the religion of\r\nthe country had become political or else histrionic in its spirit,\r\nand the figures it presented were not only multiplied, but were also\r\nhopelessly confused: while morals had sunk into very gross corruption,\r\nof which, as we have it upon explicit evidence, two at least of them\r\nlargely partook. The characters and incidents of their own time, and\r\nof the generations which immediately preceded it, were found to be\r\ngrowing less suitable for the stage. They were led, from this and other\r\ncauses, to fetch their themes, in general, from the remote period of\r\nthe heroic or pre-historic ages. But of the traditions of those ages\r\nthey were no adequate expositors; hence the representations of them\r\nare, for the most part, couched in altered and degenerate forms. This\r\nwill be most clearly seen upon examining the Homeric personages, as\r\nthey appear in the plays of Euripides. Here they seem often to retain\r\nno sign of identity except the name. The ‘form and pressure,’ and also\r\nthe machinery or physical circumstances of the Greek drama, were such\r\nas to keep the tragedians, so to speak, upon stilts, while its limited\r\nscope of necessity excluded much that was comprised in the wide circle\r\nof the epic action; so that they open to us little, in comparison with\r\nHomer, of the Greek mind and life: of that cradle wherein lie, we are\r\nto remember, the original form and elements, in so far as they are\r\nsecular, of European civilization.\r\n\r\nIf I may judge in any degree of the minds of others by my own\r\nexperience, nothing is more astonishing in Homer, than the mass of\r\nhis matter. Especially is this true of the Iliad, which most men\r\nsuppose to be little more than a gigantic battle-piece. But that poem,\r\nbattle-piece as it is, where we might expect to find only the glitter\r\nand the clash of arms, is rich in every kind of knowledge, perhaps\r\nrichest of all in the political and historical departments. It is\r\nhardly too much to say, in general, that besides his claims as a poet,\r\nHomer has, for himself, all the claims that all the other classes\r\nof ancient writers can advance for themselves, each in his separate\r\ndepartment. And, excepting the works of Aristotle and Plato, on either\r\nof which may be grafted the investigation of the whole philosophy of\r\nthe world, I know of no author, among those who are commonly studied\r\nat Oxford, offering a field of labour and inquiry either so wide or so\r\ndiversified, as that which Homer offers.\r\n\r\nBut, if Homer is not fully studied in our universities, there is no\r\nadequate consolation to be found in the fact, that he is so much read\r\nin our public schools.\r\n\r\nI am very far indeed from lamenting that he is thus read. His free and\r\ngenial temperament gives him a hold on the sympathies of the young.\r\nThe simple and direct construction of almost all his sentences allows\r\nthem easy access to his meaning; the examination of the sense of single\r\nwords, so often requisite, is within their reach; while it may readily\r\nbe believed that the large and varied inflexions of the Greek tongue,\r\nin his hands at once so accurate and so elastic, make him peculiarly\r\nfit for the indispensable and invaluable work of parsing. It may be,\r\nthat for boyhood Homer finds ample employment in his exterior and\r\nmore obvious aspects. But neither boyhood nor manhood can read Homer\r\neffectively for all purposes at once, if my estimate of those purposes\r\nbe correct. The question therefore is, how best to divide the work\r\nbetween the periods of life severally best suited to the different\r\nparts of it.\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, somewhat difficult, as a general rule, beneficially and\r\neffectively to use the same book at the same time as an instrument for\r\nteaching both the language in which it is written, and the subject\r\nof which it treats. What is given honestly to the one purpose, will\r\nordinarily be so much taken or withheld from the other. For the one\r\nobject, the mind must be directed upon the thought of the author; for\r\nthe other, upon the material organ through which it is conveyed; or,\r\nin other words, for the former of these two aims his language must be\r\nregarded on its material, for the latter on its intellectual, side.\r\nThe difficulty of combining these views, taken of necessity from\r\nopposite quarters, increases in proportion as the student is young,\r\nthe language subtle, copious, and elaborate, the subject diversified\r\nand extended. In some cases it may be slight, or, at least, easily\r\nsurmountable; but it is raised nearly to its maximum in the instance\r\nof Homer. There are few among us who can say that we learned much of\r\nthe inward parts of Homer in our boyhood; while perhaps we do not\r\nfeel that our labours upon him were below the average, such as it may\r\nhave been, of our general exertions; and though other generations\r\nmay greatly improve upon us, they cannot, I fear, master the higher\r\nproperties of their author at that early period of life. Homer, if\r\nread at our public schools, is, and probably must be, read only, or in\r\nthe main, for his diction and poetry (as commonly understood), even\r\nby the most advanced; while to those less forward he is little more\r\nthan a mechanical instrument for acquiring the beginnings of real\r\nfamiliarity with the Greek tongue and its inflexions. If, therefore,\r\nhe is to be read for his theology, history, ethics, politics, for his\r\nskill in the higher and more delicate parts of the poetic calling, for\r\nhis never-ending lessons upon manners, arts, and society, if we are to\r\nstudy in him the great map of that humanity which he so wonderfully\r\nunfolds to our gaze,--he must be read at the universities, and read\r\nwith reference to his deeper treasures. He is second to none of the\r\npoets of Greece as the poet of boys; but he is far advanced before them\r\nall, even before Æschylus and Aristophanes, as the poet of men.\r\n\r\nBut no discussion upon the general as well as poetical elevation\r\nof Homer, can be complete or satisfactory without a more definite\r\nconsideration of the question--What is the historical value of his\r\ntestimony? This is not settled by our showing either his existence, or\r\nhis excellence in his art. No man doubts Ariosto’s, or Boiardo’s, or\r\nVirgil’s personality, or their high rank as poets; but neither would\r\nany man quote them as authorities on a point of history. To arrive at\r\na right view of this further question, we must be reasonably assured\r\nalike of the nature of Homer’s original intention, of his opportunities\r\nof information, and of the soundness of his text. To these subjects\r\nI shall now proceed; in the meantime, enough may have been said to\r\nexplain the aim of these pages so far as regards the more fruitful\r\nstudy of the works of Homer, the contemplation of them on the positive\r\nside in all their bearings, and the clearing of a due space for them in\r\nthe most fitting stages of the education of the youth of England.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] The remark is, I think, Mr. Hallam’s.\r\n\r\n[8] This is the σφοδρότης, which Longinus (c. ix.) commends in the\r\nIliad, but which was perhaps excelled in the Divina Commedia.\r\n\r\n[9] Used by Longinus xv.

But when\r\nwe come to seek for high beauty and for approaches to perfection, of\r\nhow infinite a diversity, of what countless degrees, does form appear\r\nto be susceptible! How difficult it is to find these, except in mere\r\nfragments; and how dangerous does it prove, in dealing with objects, to\r\ntreat the whole as a normal specimen, simply because parts are fine,\r\nor even superlative. When, again, we pass onward, and with the body\r\nregard also the mind of man, still greater is the range of differences,\r\nand still more rare is either the development of parts in a degree\r\nso high as to bring their single excellence near the ideal standard,\r\nor the accurate adjustment of their relations to one another, or the\r\ncompleteness of the aggregate which they form.\r\n\r\nNow, it appears to me, that in the case of Homer, together with the\r\nbreadth and elevation of the highest genius, we have before us,\r\nand in a yet more remarkable degree, an even more rare fulness and\r\nconsistency of the various instruments and organs which make up the\r\napparatus of the human being--constituted as he is, in mind and body,\r\nand holding, as he does, on the one side of the Deity, and on the\r\nother, of the dust. Among all the qualities of the poems, there is\r\nnone more extraordinary than the general accuracy and perfection of\r\ntheir minute detail, when considered with reference to the standards\r\nat which from time to time they aim. Where other poets sketch, Homer\r\ndraws; and where they draw, he carves. He alone, of all the now famous\r\nepic writers, moves (in the Iliad especially) subject to the stricter\r\nlaws of time and place; he alone, while producing an unsurpassed work\r\nof the imagination, is also the greatest chronicler that ever lived,\r\nand presents to us, from his own single hand, a representation of\r\nlife, manners, history, of morals, theology, and politics, so vivid\r\nand comprehensive, that it may be hard to say whether any of the more\r\nrefined ages of Greece or Rome, with their clouds of authors and their\r\nmultiplied forms of historical record, are either more faithfully or\r\nmore completely conveyed to us. He alone presents to us a mind and an\r\norganization working with such precision that, setting aside for the\r\nmoment any question as to the genuineness of his text, we may reason\r\nin general from his minutest indications with the confidence that they\r\nbelong to some consistent and intelligible whole.\r\n\r\nIt may be right, however, to consider more circumstantially the\r\nquestion of the historical authority of Homer. It has been justly\r\nobserved by Wachsmuth[12], that even the dissolution of his\r\nindividuality does not get rid of his authority. For if the works\r\nreputed to be his had proceeded from many minds, yet still, according\r\nto their unity of colour, and their correspondence in ethical and\r\nintellectual tone with the events of the age they purport to describe,\r\nthere would arise an argument, founded on internal evidence, for\r\nthe admissibility of the whole band into the class of trustworthy\r\nhistorical witnesses.\r\n\r\nBut, first of all, may we not ask, from whence comes the presumption\r\nagainst Homer as an historical authority? Not from the fact that\r\nhe mixes marvels with common events; for this, to quote no other\r\ninstance, would destroy along with him Herodotus. Does it not arise\r\nfrom this--that his compositions are poetical--that history has long\r\nceased to adopt the poetical form--that an old association has thus\r\nbeen dissolved--that a new and adverse association has taken its place,\r\nwhich connects poetry with fiction--and that we illogically reflect\r\nthis modern association upon early times, to which it is utterly\r\ninapplicable?\r\n\r\nIf so, there is no burden of proof incumbent upon those, who regard\r\nHomer as an historical authority. The presumptions are all in favour of\r\ntheir so regarding him. The question will, of course, remain--In what\r\nproportions has he mixed history with imaginative embellishment? And\r\nhe has furnished us with some aids towards the consideration of this\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nThe immense mass of matter contained in the Iliad, which is beyond what\r\nthe action of the poem requires, and yet is in its nature properly\r\nhistorical, of itself supplies the strongest proof of the historic\r\naims of the poet. Whether, in the introduction of all this matter, he\r\nfollowed a set and conscious purpose of his own mind, or whether he\r\nonly fed the appetite of his hearers with what he found to be agreeable\r\nto them, is little material to the question. The great fact stands,\r\nthat there was either a design to fulfil, or, at least, an appetite to\r\nfeed--an intense desire to create bonds and relations with the past--to\r\ngrasp its events, and fasten them in forms which might become, and\r\nmight make them become, the property of the present and the future.\r\nWithout this great sign of nobleness in their nature, Greeks never\r\ncould have been Greeks.\r\n\r\nI have particularly in view the great multitude of genealogies;\r\ntheir extraordinary consistency one with another, and with the other\r\nhistorical indications of the poems; their extension to a very large\r\nnumber, especially in the Catalogue, of secondary persons; I take\r\nagain the Catalogue itself, that most remarkable production, as a\r\nwhole; the accuracy with which the names of the various races are\r\nhandled and bestowed throughout the poems; the particularity of the\r\ndemands regularly made upon strangers for information concerning\r\nthemselves, and especially the constant inquiry who were their parents,\r\nwhat was, for each person as he appears, _his_ relation to the past?\r\nand further, the numerous legends or narratives of prior occurrences\r\nwith which the poems, and particularly the more historic Iliad, is so\r\nthickly studded. Even the national use of patronymics as titles of\r\nhonour is in itself highly significant of the historic turn. Nay, much\r\nthat touches the general structure of the poem may be traced in part\r\nto this source; for all the intermediate Books between the Wrath and\r\nthe Return of Achilles, while they are so contrived as to heighten the\r\nmilitary grandeur of the hero, are so many tributes to the special and\r\nlocal desires in each state or district for commemoration of their\r\nparticular chiefs, which Homer would, of course, have to meet, as he\r\nitinerated through the various parts of Greece.\r\n\r\nNow, this appetite for commemoration does not fix itself upon what\r\nis imaginary; it may tolerate fiction by way of accessory and\r\nembellishment, but in the main it must, from its nature, rely upon\r\nwhat it takes to be solid food. The actions of great men in all times,\r\nbut especially in early times, afford it suitable material; and there\r\nis nothing irrational in believing that the race which in its infancy\r\nproduced so marvellous a poet as Homer, should also in its infancy\r\nhave produced great warriors and great statesmen. Composing, with such\r\npowers as his, about his own country, and for his own countrymen,\r\nhe could scarcely fail, even independently of conscious purpose,\r\nto convey to us a great mass of such matter as is in reality of the\r\nvery highest historic truth and value. If, indeed, we advance so far\r\nas to the conviction that his hearers believed him to be reciting\r\nhistorically, the main question may speedily be decided. For each\r\ngeneration of men, possessed of the mental culture necessary in order\r\nto appreciate Homer, knows too much of the generations immediately\r\npreceding to admit of utter and wholesale imposition. But it is a fair\r\ninference from the Odyssey, that the Trojan War was thus sung to the\r\nmen and the children of the men who waged it. Four lays of bards[13]\r\nare mentioned in that poem; one of Phemius, three of Demodocus; and out\r\nof the four, three relate to the War, which appears to show clearly\r\nthat its celebrity must have been both instantaneous and overpowering;\r\nthe more so, as the only remaining one has reference not to any human\r\ntransaction, but to a scene in Olympus. And I shall shortly advert\r\nto the question, whether the Homeric poems themselves were in all\r\nprobability composed not later than within two generations of the War\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nIt may be true that, with respect to some parts of his historical\r\nnotices, the poet, adapting himself to the wishes and tastes of his\r\nhearers, might take liberties without fear of detection, most of all\r\nwhere he has filled in accessories, in order to complete a picture;\r\nbut I think we should be wrong in supposing that in the interest of\r\nhis art he would have occasion to make this a general practice, or\r\nto carry it in historical subjects beyond matters of detail. Nor can\r\nI wholly disregard the analogy between his history and his equally\r\ncopious and everywhere intermixed geographical notices: such of them,\r\nI mean, as lay within the sphere of Greek experience. These indeed, he\r\ncould not, under the eyes of the men who heard him, cast into the mould\r\nof fiction; yet there could be no call of popular necessity for his\r\nunequalled and most minute precision, and it can only be accounted for\r\nby the belief that accurate record was a great purpose of his poems. If\r\nhe was thus careful to record both classes of particulars alike, and\r\nif, as to the one, we absolutely know that he has recorded them with\r\nexemplary fidelity, that fact raises a corresponding presumption of\r\nsome weight as to the other.\r\n\r\nBut there is, I think, another argument to the same effect, of the\r\nhighest degree of strength which the nature of the case admits. It\r\nis to be found in the fact that Homer has not scrupled to make some\r\nsacrifices of poetical beauty and propriety to these historic aims. For\r\nif any judicious critic were called upon to specify the chief poetical\r\nblemish of the Iliad, would he not reply by pointing to the multitude\r\nof stories from the past, having no connexion, or at best a very\r\nfeeble one, with the War, which are found in it? Such brief and minor\r\nlegends as occur in the course of the Catalogue, may have a poetical\r\npurpose; it appears not improbable that they may be introduced by way\r\nof relief to the dryness of topographical and local enumeration. But in\r\ngeneral the narratives of prior occurrences are (so to speak) rather\r\nfoisted in, and we must therefore suppose for them a purpose over and\r\nabove that, which as a mere poet Homer would have in view. It is hard\r\nto conceive that he would have indulged in them, if he had not been\r\nable to minister to this especial aim by its means. Thus, again, the\r\ncurious and important genealogy of the Dardanian House[14] is given by\r\nÆneas, in answer to Achilles, who had just shown by his taunt that\r\nhe, at least, did not want the information, but knew very well[15]\r\nthe claims and pretensions of his antagonist. Again, the long story\r\ntold by Agamemnon, in the assembly held for the Reconciliation, when\r\ndespatch was of all things requisite, may best be accounted for by the\r\ndesire to relate the circumstances attending the birth of the great\r\nnational hero, Hercules. It certainly impedes the action of the poem,\r\nwhich seems to be confessed in the rebuke insinuated by the reply of\r\nAchilles:--\r\n\r\n                        νῦν δὲ μνησώμεθα χάρμης\r\n    αἶψα μάλ’· οὐ γὰρ χρὴ κλοτοπεύειν ἐνθάδ’ ἐόντας\r\n    οὐδὲ διατρίβειν· ἔτι γὰρ μέγα ἔργον ἄρεκτον.[16]\r\n\r\nStill more is this the case when Patroclus, sent in a hurry for news\r\nby a man of the most fiery impatience, is (to use the modern phrase)\r\nbutton-held by Nestor, in the eleventh Book, and, though he has ‘no\r\ntime to sit down,’ yet is obliged to endure a speech of a hundred and\r\nfifty-two lines, ninety-three of which, containing the account of the\r\nEpean contest with Pylos, are absolutely and entirely irrelevant.\r\nIt may be said, that these effusions are naturally referable to the\r\ngarrulous age of Nestor, and to false shame and want of ingenuousness\r\nin Agamemnon. In part, too, we may compare them with the modern\r\nfashion among Orientals of introducing parables in common discourse.\r\nBut many of these have no parabolic force whatever: and from all of\r\nthem poetical beauty suffers. On the other hand, the historic matter\r\nintroduced is highly curious and interesting for the Greek races:\r\nwhy, then, should we force upon Homer the charge of neglect, folly,\r\nor drowsiness,[17] when an important purpose for these interpolations\r\nappears to lie upon the very face of them?\r\n\r\nIt will be observed, that if this reasoning in reference to the\r\ninterlocutory legends be sound, it supplies an historical character to\r\nthe poem just in the places where the general argument for it would\r\nhave been weakest; inasmuch as these legends generally relate to\r\ntimes one or two generations earlier than the Troica, and are farther\r\nremoved, by so much of additional interval, from the knowledge and\r\nexperience of his hearers.\r\n\r\nBut, over and above the episodes, which seem to owe their place in the\r\npoem to the historic aim, there are a multitude of minor shadings which\r\nrun through it, and which, as Homer could have derived no advantage\r\nfrom feigning them, we are compelled to suppose real. They are part\r\nof the graceful finish of a true story, but they have not the showy\r\ncharacter of what has been invented for effect. Why, for instance,\r\nshould Homer say of Clytæmnestra, that till corrupted by Ægisthus she\r\nwas good?[18] Why should it be worth his while to pretend that the iron\r\nball offered by Achilles for a prize was the one formerly pitched by\r\nEetion?[19] Why should he spend eight lines in describing the dry trunk\r\nround which the chariots were to drive?[20] Why should he tell us that\r\nTydeus was of small stature?[21] Why does Menelaus drive a mare?[22]\r\nWhy has Penelope a sister Iphthime, ‘who was wedded to Eumelus,’ wanted\r\nfor no other purpose than as a _persona_ for Minerva in a dream?[23]\r\nThese questions, every one will admit, might be indefinitely multiplied.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, there can be no point more important for the decision\r\nof this question, than the general tone of Homer himself. Is he, for\r\nethical and intellectual purposes, the child of that heroic age which\r\nhe describes? Does he exhibit its form and pressure? Does he chant in\r\nits key? Are there a set of ideas of the writer which are evidently\r\nnot those of his heroes, or of his heroes which are not those of\r\nthe writer, or does he sing, in the main, as Phemius and Demodocus\r\nmight themselves have sung? Wachsmuth says well, that Homer must be\r\nregarded as still within the larger boundaries of the heroic age.\r\nThere are, perhaps, signs, particularly in the Odyssey, of a first\r\nstage of transition from it; but the poet is throughout identified\r\nwith it in heart, soul, speech, and understanding. I would presume to\r\nargue thus; that Homer never would have ventured to dispense with mere\r\ndescription, and to adopt action as his sole resource--to dramatise\r\nhis poem as he has dramatised it--unless he had been strong in the\r\nconsciousness of this identity. It is no answer to say that later\r\nwriters--namely, the tragedians--dramatised the subject still more,\r\nand presented their characters on the stage without even those slender\r\naids from interjected narrative towards the comprehension of them,\r\nwhich Homer has here and there, at any rate, permitted himself to\r\nuse. For the consequence has been in their case, that they entirely\r\nfail to represent the semblance of a picture of the heroic age, or\r\nindeed of any age at all. They produce remote occurrences or fables\r\nin a dress of feelings, language, and manners suited to their own\r\ntime, as far as it is suited to any. Besides, as dramatists, they had\r\nimmense aids and advantages of other kinds; not to mention their grand\r\nnarrative auxiliary, the Chorus. But Homer enjoyed little aid from\r\naccessories, and has notwithstanding painted the very life. And yet,\r\nseeking to paint from the life, he commits it to his characters to\r\npaint themselves and one another. Surely he never could have confined\r\nhimself to this indirect process, unless he had been emboldened by the\r\nconsciousness of his own essential unity with them all. He would have\r\ndone as most other epic poets have done, whose personages we feel that\r\nwe know, not from themselves, but from what the poet in the character\r\nof intelligencer has been kind enough to tell us; whereas we learn\r\nAchilles by means of Achilles, Ulysses by means of Ulysses, and so with\r\nthe rest. Next to their own light, is the light they reflect on one\r\nanother; but we never see the poet, so to speak, holding the candle.\r\nStill, in urging all this, I feel that more remains and must remain\r\nunspoken. The question, whether Homer speaks and paints essentially\r\nin the spirit of his own age, or whether he fetches from a distance\r\nboth his facts and a manner so remarkably harmonizing with them, must\r\nafter all our discussions continue one to be settled in the last resort\r\nnot by arguments, which can only play a subsidiary part, but first\r\nby the most thorough searching and sifting of the text; then by the\r\napplication of that inward sense and feeling, to which the critics of\r\nthe destructive schools, with their ἀναποδεικταὶ φάσεις, make such\r\ncopious appeals.\r\n\r\nBut the assumption by an effort of mind of the manners and tone of\r\na remote age, joined with the consistent support of this character\r\nthroughout prolonged works, is of very rare occurrence. In Greek\r\nliterature there is nothing, to my knowledge, which at all approaches\r\nit; and this I think may fairly be urged as of itself almost conclusive\r\nagainst ascribing it to Homer. The later tragedians, in whose\r\ncompositions we should look for it, do not apparently so much as think\r\nof it; and it is most difficult to suppose a poet so national as Homer\r\nto be in this cardinal respect entirely different from all others of\r\nhis race. Indeed the supposition is radically at variance with the\r\nidea of his poetical character; of which the very groundwork lies in a\r\nchildlike unconsciousness, and in the unity of Art with Nature[24].\r\n\r\nMay we not, however, go a good deal further, and say boldly that the\r\nfaculty of assuming in literary compositions an archaic costume, voice,\r\nand manner, does not belong at all either to an age like that of Homer,\r\nor to any age of which the literary conditions at all resemble it?\r\n\r\nIn the first place, an inventor, working like Homer for the general\r\npublic, must, by departing altogether from the modes of thought,\r\nexpression, and action current in his own day, _pro tanto_ lose his\r\nhold upon those on whose approval he depends. It seems to follow that\r\nthis will not be seriously attempted, except in an age which has\r\nceased to afford a liberal supply of the materials of romance. Is not\r\nthis presumption made good by experience? The Greek tragedians, it is\r\nindisputable, did not find it necessary to aim, and did not aim, at\r\nreproducing the whole contemporary apparatus, which was in strictness\r\nappropriate and due to their characters. Virgil made no such attempt in\r\nthe Æneid, of which, notwithstanding the manners abound in anachronisms\r\nof detail. The romance poets of Italy idealize their subject, not,\r\nhowever, by the revival of antique manners with their proper apparatus\r\nof incidents, but by means of an abundant preternatural machinery.\r\nEven in Shakespeare’s King John, Henry IV, or Henry VIII, how little\r\ndifference can be detected from the Elizabethan age, or (in this point)\r\nfrom one another[25]. Again, in Macbeth or Lear, enough is done\r\nto prevent our utterly confounding their ages with the common life\r\nof the hearers; but there is nothing that approaches to a complete\r\ncharacteristic representation of the respective times to which the\r\npersonages are supposed to belong. So, again, in Coriolanus, Julius\r\nCæsar, or Antony and Cleopatra, there is a sort of Roman _toga_ thrown\r\nloosely over the figures; but we do not feel ourselves amidst Roman\r\nlife when we read them. And, in truth, what is done at all in these\r\ncases is not done so much by reproducing as by generalizing, in the\r\nsame sense as a painter generalizes his draperies. A great instance\r\nof the genuine process of reproduction is to be found in Sir Walter\r\nScott. He, however, besides being a man of powerful genius, cast not\r\nin the mould of his own age, but in one essentially belonging to the\r\npast, was a master of antiquarian knowledge. And this leads me to\r\nname what seems to be the second condition of serious and successful\r\nattempts (I need not here speak of burlesques, of which all the touches\r\nmust be broad ones) at disinterring and reviving bygone ages in the\r\nwhole circle and scheme of their life. The first, as has been already\r\nsaid, is to live in an age itself socially old, so as not to abound in\r\nproper materials for high invention. The second is, to live in an age\r\npossessed of such abundant documents and records of a former time as to\r\nmake it practicable to explore it in all points by historical _data_.\r\nThis condition was wanting to Virgil, even supposing him to have had\r\nthe necessary tastes and qualifications. It was not wanting to Scott,\r\nwith reference especially to the period of the Stuarts, who, besides\r\na vast abundance of oral and written traditions, had laws, usages,\r\narchitecture, arms, coins, utensils, every imaginable form of relic\r\nand of testimony at his command, so that he could himself first live\r\nin the age of his works, and then, when himself acclimatised, invent\r\naccording to it.\r\n\r\nIn all this it is not forgotten that a certain amount of archaism is\r\nindispensable in all works purporting to draw their subject from a\r\nlong-past age. But this _minimum_ need only be slight and general,\r\nas in the Æneid; and it consists rather in the exclusion of modern\r\naccessories, than in the revival of the original tone. And again,\r\nthe very choice of subject, as it is grave and severe or light and\r\ngay, will to some extent influence the manners: the former will\r\nspontaneously lean towards the past, the latter, depending on the zest\r\nof novelty, will be more disposed to clothe itself in the forms of the\r\npresent. Thus we have a more antique tone in Henry the Fifth, than in\r\nthe Merry Wives of Windsor. But archaic colouring within limits such as\r\nthese is broadly different from such systematic representation of the\r\nantique as Homer must have practised, if he had practised it at all.\r\n\r\nAs in romance and poetry, so in the progress of the drama, this\r\nmethod appears to be the business of a late age. The strength of\r\ndramatic imagination is always when the drama itself is young. It\r\nthen confidently relies upon its essential elements for the necessary\r\nillusion; it knows little, and cares less, about sustaining it by\r\nelaborate attention to minor emblems and incidents. But when it has\r\nlived into the old age of civilized society, when the critical faculty\r\nhas become strong and the imagination weak, then it strengthens\r\nitself by minute accuracy in scenery and costume,--in fact, by exact\r\nreproduction. This is indeed the novel gift of our own time: and by\r\nmeans of it theatrical revivals are now understood and practised among\r\nourselves in a manner which former generations could not emulate, but\r\ndid not require.\r\n\r\nNor must we forget the importance, with reference to this discussion,\r\nof Homer’s minuteness, precision, and multitude of details. Every one\r\nof these, be it remembered, if we suppose him not to be painting from\r\nthe life, affords an additional chance of detection, by the discrepancy\r\nbetween the life habitually present to the poet’s experience, and that\r\nwhich he is representing by effort. But the voice of the Homeric poems\r\nis in this respect, after all, unisonous, like that of the Greeks,\r\nand not multiform, like that of the Trojan army[26]. We are driven,\r\ntherefore, to suppose that Homer practised this art of reproduction on\r\na scale, as well as with a success, since unheard of, and this at a\r\nperiod when, according to all likelihood and all other experience, it\r\ncould only in a very limited sense be possible to practice it at all.\r\nThe extravagance of these suppositions tells powerfully against them,\r\nand once more throws us back on the belief that the objects which he\r\npainted were, in the main, those which his own age placed beneath his\r\nview.\r\n\r\nThis view of the historical character of Homer, I believe,\r\nsubstantially agrees with that taken by the Greeks in general. If I\r\nrefer to Strabo, in his remarkable Prolegomena[27], it is because he\r\nhad occasion to consider the point particularly. Eratosthenes had\r\ntreated the great sire of poets as a fabulist. Strabo confutes him.\r\nEratosthenes had himself noticed the precision of the geographical\r\ndetails: Thisbe, with its doves; Haliartus and its meadows; Anthedon,\r\nthe boundary; Lilæa by the sources of Cephissus; and Strabo retorts\r\nupon him with force--πότερον οὖν ὁ ποιῶν ταῦτα ψυχαγωγοῦντι ἔοικεν ἢ\r\nδιδάσκοντι; his general conclusion is, that Homer used fiction, as his\r\nsmith in the Odyssey used gold for plating silver:--\r\n\r\n    ὡς δ’ ὅτε τις χρυσὸν περιχεύεται ἀργύρῳ ἀνὴρ,\r\n\r\nthat so Homer adjoined mythical ornaments to true events. But history\r\nwas the basis:--ἔλαβεν οὖν παρὰ τῆς ἱστορίας τὰς ἀρχάς[28]. And, in\r\nadopting the belief that Homer is to be taken generally for a most\r\ntrustworthy witness to facts, I am far from saying that there are no\r\ncases of exception, where he may reasonably be suspected of showing\r\nless than his usual fidelity. The doctrine must be accepted with\r\nlatitude: the question is not whether it is absolutely safe, but\r\nwhether it is the least unsafe. We may most reasonably, perhaps, view\r\nhis statements and representations with a special jealousy, when they\r\nare such as appear systematically contrived to enhance the distinctive\r\nexcellencies of his nation. Thus, for instance, both in the causes\r\nand incidents of the war, and in the relative qualities and merits of\r\nGreeks and Trojans, we may do well to check the too rapid action of\r\nour judgments, and to allow some scope to the supposition, that the\r\nhistorical duties of the bard might here naturally become subordinate\r\nto his patriotic purpose in glorifying the sires of his hearers, that\r\nimmortal group who became through him the fountain head to Greece, both\r\nof national unity and of national fame.\r\n\r\nIndeed, while I contend keenly for the historic aim and character of\r\nHomer, I understand the terms in a sense much higher than that of mere\r\nprecision in the leading narration. We may, as I am disposed to think,\r\neven if we should disbelieve the existence of Helen, of Agamemnon, or\r\nof Troy, yet hold, in all that is most essential, by the historical\r\ncharacter of Homer. For myself, I ask to be permitted to believe in\r\nthese, and in much besides these; yet I also plead that the main\r\nquestion is not whether he has correctly recorded a certain series\r\nof transactions, but whether he has truly and faithfully represented\r\nmanners and characters, feelings and tastes, races and countries,\r\nprinciples and institutions. Here lies the pith of history; these it\r\nhas for its soul, and fact for its body. It does not appear to me\r\nreasonable to presume that Homer idealized his narration with anything\r\nlike the license which was permitted to the Carlovingian romance; yet\r\neven that romance did not fail to retain in many of the most essential\r\nparticulars a true historic character; and it conveys to us, partly by\r\nfact and partly through a vast parable, the inward life of a period\r\npregnant with forces that were to operate powerfully upon our own\r\ncharacters and condition. Even those who would regard the cases as\r\nparallel should, therefore, remember that they too must read Homer\r\notherwise than as a poet in the vulgar and more prevailing sense, which\r\ndivests poetry of its relation to reality. The more they read him in\r\nthat spirit the higher, I believe, they will raise their estimate of\r\nhis still unknown and unappreciated treasures.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12] Historical Antiquities of the Greeks, vol i.

I prefer to dwell upon the\r\nproposition that he is an original witness to manners, characters, and\r\nideas such as those of his poems. It is not necessary, to make good\r\nthis proposition, that we should determine a given number of years\r\nas the maximum that could have passed between the Trojan war and the\r\ncomposition of the Iliad or Odyssey. But the internal evidence seems to\r\nme very strongly to support the belief, that he lived before the Dorian\r\nconquest of the Peloponnesus. That he was not an eye-witness of the\r\nwar, we absolutely know from the Invocation before the Catalogue[29].\r\nIt also appears[30] that he must have seen the grandchildren of Æneas\r\nreigning over the land of Priam. It is no extravagant supposition that\r\nforty or fifty years after the siege, perhaps even less, might have\r\nbrought this to pass.\r\n\r\nThe single idea or form of expression in the poems, which at first\r\nsight tends to suggest a very long interval, is that quoted by Velleius\r\nPaterculus[31], the οἷοι νῦν βροτοί εἰσι[32]. But the question arises,\r\nwhether this is an historical land-mark, or a poetical embellishment?\r\nIn the former sense, as implying a great physical degeneracy of\r\nmankind, it would require us to suppose nothing less than a lapse\r\nof centuries between the Troica and the epoch of the poet. This\r\nhypothesis, though Heyne speaks of the eighth or ninth generation[33],\r\ngeneral opinion has rejected. If it be dismissed, and if we adopt\r\nthe view of this formula as an ornament, it loses all definite\r\nchronological significance. Thus it is lost in the phrase, common in\r\nour own time with respect to the intellectual characters of men now\r\nno more, but yet not removed from us, perhaps, by more than from a\r\nquarter to half a century--‘there were giants in those days.’ Nay,\r\nthe observation of Paterculus, especially as he was an enthusiastic\r\nadmirer, itself exemplifies the little care with which these questions\r\nhave been treated. For the Iliad itself supplies a complete answer in\r\nthe speech of Nestor, who draws the very same contrast between the\r\nheroes of the Troica and those of his own earlier days:\r\n\r\n                          κείνοισι δ’ ἂν οὔτις\r\n    τῶν οἱ νῦν βροτοί εἰσιν ἐπιχθονίων μαχέοιτο[34].\r\n\r\nAnd it is curious that we have in these words a measure, supplied by\r\nHomer himself, of the real force of the phrase, which seems to fix it\r\nat something under half a century, and thus makes it harmonise with\r\nthe indication afforded by the passage relating to the descendants of\r\nÆneas. The argument of Mitford[35] on the age of Homer appears to me\r\nto be of great value: and, while it is rejected, it is not answered\r\nby Heyne[36]. Nor is it easy to conceive the answer to those who urge\r\nthat, so far as the poet’s testimony goes, the years from Pirithous\r\nto the siege are as many as from the siege to his own day[37]. But\r\nPirithous was the father of Polypætes, who led a Thessalian division in\r\nthe war.[38]\r\n\r\nIf this view of Homer’s meaning in the particular case be correct,\r\nwe can the better understand why it is that the poet, who uses this\r\nform of enhancement four times in the Iliad, does not employ it in the\r\nOdyssey, though it is the later poem, and though he had opportunities\r\nenough; such as the athletic exploits of Ulysses in Phæacia, and\r\nespecially the handling of the Bow in Ithaca. For in the Iliad a more\r\nantique tone of colouring prevails, as it is demanded by the loftier\r\nstrain of the action.\r\n\r\nThere is one passage, and one only, which is just capable of being\r\nconstrued as an allusion to the great Dorian conquest: it is that in\r\nthe Fourth Book of the Iliad, where Juno tells Jupiter that she well\r\nknows he can destroy in spite of her, whensoever he may choose, her\r\nthree dearest cities, Argos, Sparta, and Mycenæ[39]. It is probable\r\nthat the passage refers to sacking such as had been practised by\r\nHercules[40], and such as is pathetically described by Phœnix[41].\r\nBut, in the first place, we do not know that these cities were in any\r\nsense destroyed by the Dorian conquest, more than they had been by\r\nprevious dynastic and territorial changes. If, on the other hand, it\r\nbe contended, that we need not construe the passage as implying more\r\nthan revolution independent of material destruction, then we need\r\nnot introduce the idea of the Dorian conquest at all to sustain the\r\npropriety of the passage, for Homer already knew by tradition how those\r\ncities, and the territory to which they belonged, had changed hands\r\nfrom Danaïds to Perseids, and from Perseids to Pelopids.\r\n\r\nBut indications even far less equivocal from an isolated passage\r\nwould be many times outweighed, in a case like that of Homer, by any\r\nconclusion justly drawn from features, whether positive or negative,\r\nthat are rooted in the general body of the poems. Now such a conclusion\r\narises from the admitted and total absence of any allusion in Homer\r\nto the general incidents of the great Dorian conquest, and to the\r\nconsequent reconstruction of the old or European Greece, or to the\r\nmigrations eastward, or to the very existence of the new Asiatic Greece\r\nwhich it is supposed to have called into being. Respecting the conquest\r\nitself, he might by a sustained effort of deliberate intention have\r\nkept silence: but is it possible that he could have avoided betraying\r\nby reference to results, on a thousand occasions, his knowledge of a\r\nchange which had drawn anew the whole surface of society in Greece? It\r\nwould be more rational, were we driven to it (which is not the case),\r\neven to suppose that the passage in question had been tampered with,\r\nthan to imagine that the poet could have forborne through twenty-eight\r\nthousand lines, to make any other reference to, or further betray his\r\nknowledge of, events which must on this supposition have occupied for\r\nhim so large a part of the whole horizon of life and experience.\r\n\r\nAgain, the allusions to the trumpet and the riding-horse found in\r\nillustrative passages, but not as used in the war, are by far too\r\nslight and doubtful, to sustain the theory that Homer saw around him a\r\nsystem of warfare different from that which he recorded; and require\r\nus to adopt no supposition for the explanation of them, beyond the\r\nvery natural one that the heroic poet, without essentially changing\r\nmanners, yet, within certain limits, insensibly projects himself and\r\nhis subject from the foreground of every-day life into the mellowness\r\nof distance; and, therefore, that he may advisedly have excluded from\r\nhis poem certain objects or practices, which notwithstanding he knew\r\nto have been more or less in use. Again, what are we to say to the\r\nminute knowledge of Greece proper and the Peloponnesus, which Homer has\r\ndisplayed? Why does he (apparently) know it so much better than he knew\r\nAsia Minor? How among the rude Dorians, just emerged from comparative\r\nbarbarism, could he learn it at all? How strange, that Lycurgus\r\nshould have acquired the fame of having first introduced the poems to\r\nthe Peloponnesus, unless a great revolution and a substitution of one\r\ndominant race for another had come between, to obliterate or greatly\r\nweaken the recollection of them in the very country, which beyond all\r\nothers they covered with a blaze of glory.\r\n\r\nOf the very small number of passages in the poems which contain a\r\nreference to events later than the action, there are two, both relating\r\nto the same subject, for which at first sight it appears difficult\r\nto account. Why does Neptune obtrude upon the Olympian Court his\r\ninsignificant and rather absurd jealousy, lest the work of defence,\r\nhastily thrown up by the Achæan army, should eclipse the wall built\r\naround Troy by Apollo and himself? Evidently in order to obtain from\r\nJupiter the suggestion, that he should subsequently himself efface all\r\ntraces of it. But why does Homer show this anxiety to account for its\r\nnon-appearance? Why does he return subsequently to the subject, and\r\nmost carefully relate how Jupiter by raining, and Apollo by turning the\r\nmouths of eight rivers, and Neptune with his trident, all cooperated to\r\ndestroy the work, and make the shore smooth and even again? Had Homer\r\nlived many generations after the Trojan war, these passages would have\r\nbeen entirely without purpose, for he need not then have given reasons\r\nto show, why ages had left no trace still visible of the labour of\r\na day. But if he lived near the period of the war, the case is very\r\ndifferent. He might then be challenged by his maritime hearers, who,\r\nif they frequented the passage into the Sea of Marmora, would have had\r\nclear views of the camp of Agamemnon, and who would naturally require\r\nhim to assign a cause for the disappearance even of such a work as\r\na day’s labour of the army could produce, and as the Trojan soldiery\r\ncould make practicable for their chariots to drive over[42].\r\n\r\nThese particular indications appear to be worth considering: but the\r\ngreat reasons for placing the date of Homer very near to that of the\r\nWar are, his visible identity with the age, the altering but not yet\r\nvanished age, of which he sings, and the broad interval in tone and\r\nfeeling between himself, and the very nearest of all that follows him.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[29] Il. ii. 486.\r\n\r\n[30] Il. xx. 308.\r\n\r\n[31] Hist. i. 5.\r\n\r\n[32] Il. v. 304; xii. 383, 449; xx. 287.\r\n\r\n[33] Exc. iii. ad Il. xxiv., vol. viii. p. 828.\r\n\r\n[34] Il. i. 262-272.\r\n\r\n[35] Hist.

In order fairly to raise the issue, the two following\r\npropositions may be stated as fitting canons of Homeric study:--\r\n\r\n1. That we should adopt the text itself as the basis of all Homeric\r\ninquiry, and not any preconceived theory, nor any arbitrary standard of\r\ncriticism, referable to particular periods, schools, or persons.\r\n\r\n2. That as we proceed in any work of construction by evidence drawn\r\nfrom the text, we should avoid the temptation to solve difficulties\r\nfound to lie in our way, by denouncing particular portions of it as\r\ncorrupt or interpolated: should never set it aside except upon the\r\nclosest examination of the particular passage questioned; should use\r\nsparingly the liberty even of arraying presumptions against it; and\r\nshould always let the reader understand both when and why it is\r\nquestioned.\r\n\r\nNow, let us consider these rules, and the method which it is proposed\r\nby means of them to apply,\r\n\r\n_a._ With reference to the failure of other methods.\r\n\r\n_b._ With reference to the antecedent probabilities for or against the\r\ngeneral soundness of the text.\r\n\r\n_c._ With reference to the internal evidence of soundness or\r\nunsoundness afforded by the text itself.\r\n\r\nThe first of the two rules has been brought more and more into\r\noperation by the believers in Homer as the Poet of the Iliad and the\r\nOdyssey, in self-defence against the sceptical theories: and it has\r\nbeen both announced and acted upon by Mure with such breadth and\r\ncompleteness, as to leave to those, who adopt it, simply the duty of\r\ntreading in his footsteps.\r\n\r\nAgain, as to the second, it may now be hoped that by the force of\r\ncircumstances it is gradually coming into vogue, though perhaps less,\r\nas yet, by a distinct conviction of its reasonableness, than through\r\nthe utter failure and abortiveness of all other methods. First to\r\ntheorise rashly (with or without consciousness), and then rudely\r\nto excise from the Homeric text whatever clashes with our crude\r\nconceptions, is, after all, an essentially superficial and vulgar\r\nmethod of proceeding: and if it was excusable before the evidence\r\ntouching the Poet and the text had been so greatly confirmed, as it\r\nhas recently been, by closer scrutiny, it can hardly be forgiven now.\r\nThe text of Homer cannot be faultless: but, in the first place, it is\r\nplain, as far as general consent can make it so, that the poems, as\r\nthey stand, afford a far better and surer foundation than any other\r\nform of them which has been proposed, whether curtailed in their\r\nprincipal members, as by the destructive school, or only amended\r\nby free handling in detail. All the recasting processes which have\r\nyet been tried, have begotten ten solecisms, or another solecism of\r\ntenfold magnitude, for every one that they did away. In fact, the end\r\nof schemes, such as that of Lachmann[44], has been not to achieve any\r\nthing like real progress in a continuous work, but simply to launch so\r\nmany distinct speculations, isolated, conflicting, each resting on its\r\nauthor’s own hearty approval, and each drawing from the rest of the\r\nworld no other sign than the shrug or the smile, which seems to be the\r\nproper reward of perverted ingenuity.\r\n\r\nIt would be presumptuous and unjust to treat the remarkable performance\r\nof Mr. Payne Knight as one of what may be called--to borrow a phrase\r\nfrom the commercial world--the Homeric bubble-schemes. It was\r\nanticipated with eagerness by Heyne. It was hailed by the calm judgment\r\nand refined taste of Lord Aberdeen. Yet this was not enough.\r\n\r\n    ἁμέραι δ’ ἐπίλοιποι\r\n    μάρτυρες σοφώτατοι[45].\r\n\r\nThe ordeal of time has not destroyed the value of Mr. Payne Knight’s\r\nProlegomena, but it has been decidedly unfavourable to his text as a\r\npractical attempt at reconstruction. With the old text in the right\r\nhand, and Mr. Knight’s in the left, who would doubt in which to look\r\nfor the nearest likeness to Homer? Or who will ever again venture to\r\npublish an abridged or re-modelled Iliad?\r\n\r\nApart, however, from the unsatisfactoriness of the results of\r\nattempts at reconstruction, have we reason to believe that the text\r\nof Homer has, as a whole, been seriously vitiated by interpolation\r\nor corruption? The difficulties attending its transmission from the\r\ntime of the poet are not to be denied. But I think we have scarcely\r\nenough considered the amount of means which were available, and which\r\nwere actually employed, in order to neutralize those difficulties,\r\nand achieve the task. Although writing of some description appears to\r\nhave existed at the epoch of the Poems, it can be probably proved,\r\nand may at any rate be fully admitted, that Homer did not write, but\r\nrecited only. This is the first step: now for the second. I pass by\r\nthe argument with those, who deny that poems of this length could be\r\ntransmitted orally at all, as one already disposed of by the general\r\nverdict of the world. So, likewise, I leave behind me, at the point\r\nwhere Mure has placed them, all the reasonings of the _piecers_, who\r\nsay that there were originally a number of Iliadic and Odyssean songs,\r\nafterwards made up into the poems such as we now have them: of the\r\n_amplifiers_, who look upon them as expanded respectively by gradual\r\ninterpolations and additions from an original of small dimensions; of\r\nthe _separators_, who will have just two Homers and no more, one for\r\nthe Iliad, and one for the Odyssey. I assume for the present purpose\r\nthe contrary of all these three propositions: and simply invite those\r\nwho disbelieve them, but who also conceive that the text is generally\r\nunsafe and untrustworthy in its detail, to some consideration of that\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to weigh retrospectively the probable fortunes of the\r\nHomeric text, I presume that we may establish as our point of departure\r\nthe judgment delivered by Heyne[46], that the manuscripts of Homer are\r\nsatisfactory: that we possess all, or nearly all, that the Alexandrian\r\ncritics possessed; and that by the advance of the critical art, we\r\nhave now probably, on the whole, a better and truer Homer than that of\r\nAristarchus, which is the basis of the modern text. The imperfect state\r\nof notation when writing first began to be used, and the changes in\r\npronunciation, have not, we may also suppose with Heyne[47], done more\r\nthan trifling or secondary damage to the copies.\r\n\r\nThe first serious question is this; how far was Homer mutilated, first,\r\nby the rhapsodists, or reciters, before he was put into writing, and\r\nsecondly, by those who, in order to bring the lays of the Iliad into\r\none body, must, it is assumed, have added and altered much, even if\r\nthey had no whims of their own, and only sought to do what was needful\r\n_nexûs et juncturæ causâ_. It is, of course, admitted that these lays,\r\neven though ideally one as they came from their framer, were in many\r\ncases actually separated. And Heyne quotes the Scholiast of Pindar[48],\r\ncomplaining by report that Cinæthus and his school had interpolated\r\nlargely, as well as the passage in which Josephus[49] (so he states)\r\ngives it as his opinion that the Iliad, from having been pieced\r\ntogether long after it was composed, presented many discrepancies.\r\nNow, even if this were the opinion of Josephus, it would have no more\r\npretension to historical authority, than if it had been delivered\r\nyesterday. But the fact is, that Josephus mentions it simply as a\r\ncurrent notion; φασὶν οὐδὲ τοῦτον ... ἀλλὰ διαμνημονευομένην ... καὶ\r\nδιὰ τοῦτο πολλὰς ἐν αὐτῇ σχεῖν τὰς διαφωνίας. Indeed, it cannot be too\r\ncarefully borne in mind, that if the positive notices of Homer in early\r\ntimes are slight, so as to throw us back very much upon the poems for\r\ntheir own vindication, yet, on the other hand, all the authorities\r\ncited on the sceptical side, are chronologically so remote from the\r\nquestion in debate, that they are but opinions and not proofs, and that\r\nwe may canvass and question them without the smallest scruple, or fear\r\nthat we are pitting mere theory against legitimate evidence.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be denied that the condition of the Homeric poems,\r\nbefore they were committed to writing, was one of great danger. But\r\nthe question may well be asked, how came poems of such length to\r\nbe preserved at all by mere oral transmission through a period of\r\nundefined, and possibly of very great, length? It is plain that nothing\r\nbut an extraordinary celebrity, and a passionate attachment on the part\r\nof the people, could have kept them alive. Now, if we suppose this\r\ncelebrity and this attachment, let us inquire further, whether they\r\nmay not have supplied the means of neutralizing and counteracting, in\r\nthe main, the dangers to which the poems were exposed; and whether\r\nit is unreasonable to say, That which _could_ have preserved them in\r\ntheir unity at all, _must_, in all likelihood, have preserved them\r\nin a tolerably genuine state. Fully admitting that the evidence in\r\nthe case is imperfect, and can only lead to disputable conclusions, I\r\nnevertheless ask, What is the most probable supposition respecting the\r\ncondition of the Homeric poems in the pre-historic times of Greece?\r\nIs it not this--that, with due allowance for a different state of\r\ncircumstances, they were then, what they were in later times; the\r\nbroad basis of mental culture; the great monument of the glory of the\r\nnation, and of each particular State or race; the prime entertainment\r\nof those prolonged festive gatherings which were so characteristic of\r\nearly Greece; that they were not only the special charge and pride\r\nof particular poetical schools, but distinct objects of the care of\r\nlegislators and statesmen; that in this manner they were recognised as\r\namong the institutions of the country, and that they had thus to depend\r\nfor their transmission, not only on the fire of national and poetic\r\nfeeling, but upon a jealous custody much resembling that which even a\r\ncomparatively rude people gives to its laws?\r\n\r\nI shall attempt a summary of the arguments and testimonies which appear\r\nto me to recommend, if they do not compel, the adoption of these\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\n1. Heraclides Ponticus, a pupil of Plato, in a fragment περὶ πολιτειῶν,\r\ndeclares that Lycurgus was the first to bring the poetry of Homer\r\ninto Peloponnesus: τὴν Ὁμήρου ποίησιν, παρὰ τῶν ἀπογόνων Κρεοφύλου\r\nλαβὼν, πρῶτος διεκόμισεν εἰς Πελοπόννησον. This testimony is late\r\nwith reference to the fact it reports, but not late in the history\r\nof Greek literature. Of the source from which it was derived by the\r\nauthor who gives it us, we know nothing. No light is thrown upon it by\r\nÆlian,[50] who adds the epithet ἀθρόαν to ποίησιν. Plutarch enlarges\r\nthe expression of the tradition, but seems to add little to its matter,\r\nexcept that some portions of Homer were known before Lycurgus brought\r\nthe whole from Crete.[51] It is stated in the Republic of Plato,[52]\r\nthat Creophylus was a companion of Homer. Strabo[53] informs us that\r\nhe was a Samian; and Hermodamas, the master of Pythagoras, is said\r\nby Diogenes Laertius[54] to have been his descendant. Now, we cannot\r\ncall any part of these statements history; but they exhibit a body\r\nof tradition, of which the members, drawn from scattered quarters,\r\nagree with one another, and agree also with the general probability\r\nthat arises out of a fact so astonishing as is in itself the actual\r\npreservation of the poems of Homer. It is in truth this fact that\r\nlays the best ground for traditions such as the one in question. If\r\nthey came before us artificially complete and embellished, that might\r\nbe made a ground of suspicion. But appearing, as this one does, with\r\nan evident absence of design, there is every presumption of its truth.\r\nBefore considering the full force which attaches to it if it be true,\r\nwe will draw out the kindred traditions.\r\n\r\n2. Of these, the next, and a most important one, is the statement of\r\nHerodotus respecting Clisthenes, the ruler of Sicyon, who, when he\r\nhad been at war with Argos, ῥαψῳδοὺς ἔπαυσε ἐν Σικυῶνι ἀγωνίζεσθαι,\r\nτῶν Ὁμηρείων ἐπέων εἵνεκα, ὅτι Ἀργεῖοί τε καὶ Ἄργος τὰ πολλὰ πάντα\r\nὑμνέαται[55]. He proceeds to say, that Clisthenes sought to banish the\r\nmemory of Adrastus, as being an Argive hero, from Sicyon. It is not\r\nnecessary to inquire what these Homeric poems may have included; but\r\nthe conclusion of Grote, that they were ‘the Thebais and the Epigoni,\r\nnot the Iliad[56],’ seems to me incredible. Nor is it correct that\r\nthe Iliad fails to supply matter to which the statement may refer. In\r\nthe Iliad, the name of Argos, though meaning it is true the country\r\nrather than a city, is nearly associated with the chief seat of power,\r\nand becomes representative of the whole Hellenic race in its heroic\r\ninfancy. This is surely honour infinitely higher, than any local fame\r\nit could derive from the civil feud with Thebes. The Iliad, too, marks\r\nmost clearly the connexion of Adrastus with Argos--for it names Diomed\r\nas the husband of his daughter or granddaughter, Ægialea[57]; it also\r\nmarks the subordinate position of Sicyon,\r\n\r\n    ὅθ’ ἄρ’ Ἄδρηστος πρῶτ’ ἐμβασίλευεν[58],\r\n\r\nby making it a mere town in the dominions of Agamemnon, while Argos\r\nfigures as a sovereign and powerful city. There may therefore perhaps\r\nbe room to doubt whether Herodotus meant even to include the Thebais or\r\nEpigoni in the phrase ‘Homeric poems.’\r\n\r\nBut the importance of the passage is not wholly dependent on these\r\nconsiderations. It shows,\r\n\r\n_a._ That there were, at Sicyon, State-recitations of Homer six\r\ncenturies before the Christian era, attended with rewards for the\r\nsuccessful performers.\r\n\r\n_b._ That these recitations were in conformity with common use; for\r\nthey are named as something ordinary and established, which was then\r\nset aside, not as a custom peculiar to Sicyon.\r\n\r\n_c._ That the recitations depended upon the Homeric poems, since they\r\nwere entirely stopped on account of exceptionable matter which the\r\nHomeric poems were deemed to contain.\r\n\r\n_d._ That these recitations were in the nature of competitive contests\r\namong the rhapsodists, when the best and most approved, of course,\r\nwould obtain prizes. This implies that the recitations were not single,\r\nas if by poet laureates, but that many shared in them.\r\n\r\n3. Next to this tradition, and nearly coeval with it, but reported by\r\nlater authority, is that respecting Solon and Athens. Dieuchidas of\r\nMegara, an author of uncertain age, placed by Heyne[59] later than\r\nAlexander, is quoted in Diogenes Laertius[60] as testifying to the\r\nfollowing effect concerning Solon: τά τε Ὁμήρου ἐξ ὑποβολῆς γέγραφε\r\nῥαψῳδεῖσθαι. οἷον ὅπου ὁ πρῶτος ἔληξεν, ἐκεῖθεν ἄρχεσθαι τὸν ἐχόμενον.\r\nμᾶλλον οὖν Σόλων Ὅμηρον ἐφώτισεν, ἢ Πεισίστρατος. But we have also a\r\nbetter witness, I think, in Lycurgus the orator, contemporary with\r\nDemosthenes,[61] who gives a most striking account of the political\r\nand martial use of the Homeric songs. He says, οὕτω γὰρ ὑπέλαβον ὑμῶν\r\nοἱ πατέρες σπουδαῖον εἶναι ποιήτην, ὥστε νόμον ἔθεντο καθ’ ἑκάστην\r\nπενταετηρίδα τῶν Παναθηναίων μόνου τῶν ἄλλων ποιήτων ῥαψωδεῖσθαι τὰ\r\nἔπη. ‘It was with these songs in their ears,’ he proceeds, ‘that your\r\nfathers fought at Marathon; and so valiant were they _then_, that from\r\namong them their brave rivals, the Lacedæmonians, sought a general,\r\nTyrtæus.’\r\n\r\n_a._ Now, these words appear to carry the traditional origin of this\r\nlaw, as far as the authority of Lycurgus will avail, back to the early\r\npart of the seventh century, when Tyrtæus lived.[62]\r\n\r\n_b._ Thus, at the period when Athens is just beginning to rise towards\r\neminence, she enacts a law that the poems of Homer shall be recited at\r\nher greatest festival.\r\n\r\n_c._ This honour she accords to Homer (whatever that name may have\r\nimported) alone among poets.\r\n\r\n_d._ This appears, from the connexion with Tyrtæus, to be a tradition\r\nof a matter older still than the one mentioned by Dieuchidas. But\r\nthe two are in thorough accordance. For Dieuchidas does not say that\r\nSolon introduced the recitations of Homer, nor does he refer simply\r\nto the Panathenaica. He pretty clearly implies, that Solon did not\r\nbegin the recitations, but that he reformed--(by bringing them into\r\nregular succession, which implies a fixed order of the songs)--what had\r\nbeen introduced already; while Lycurgus seems to supply the notice of\r\nthe original introduction as having occurred before the time even of\r\nTyrtæus.\r\n\r\n4. The argument from the sculptures on the chest of Cypselus,\r\nrepresenting subjects taken out of the Iliad, refers to a period nearly\r\ncorresponding with that of Tyrtæus, as Cypselus was probably born about\r\nB. C. 700: and tends to show that the Iliad was famous in Corinth at\r\nthat date.[63]\r\n\r\n5. The next of the specific traditions is that relating to Pisistratus.\r\nTo his agency it has been the fashion of late years to assign an\r\nexaggerated, or even an exclusive, importance. But whereas the\r\ntestimonies respecting Lycurgus, Clisthenes, and Solon, (as well as the\r\nAthenian legislators before him,) are derived from authors probably,\r\nor certainly, of the fourth and fifth centuries B. C., we have none at\r\nall respecting Pisistratus earlier than the Augustan age.[64] Cicero\r\nsays he first disposed the Homeric books in their present order;\r\nPausanias,[65] that he collected them, διεσπασμένα τε καὶ ἀλλαχοῦ\r\nμνημονευόμενα; Josephus,[66] who, as we have seen, merely refers to the\r\nreport that the Iliad was not committed to writing until after Homer’s\r\ntime, is wrongly quoted[67] as a witness to the labours of Pisistratus.\r\nAn ancient Scholion, recently discovered,[68] names four poets who\r\nworked under that prince. And it may be admitted, that the traditions\r\nrespecting Pisistratus have this distinctive mark--that they seem to\r\nindicate the first accomplishment of a critical and literary task upon\r\nHomer’s text under the direct care and responsibility of the sovereign\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nThus, the testimony concerning Pisistratus is of an order decidedly\r\ninferior to that which supports the earlier traditions, and cannot with\r\npropriety be put into the scale against them where they are in conflict\r\nwith it; but there is no reason to reject the report that he fixed the\r\nparticular order of the poems, which the law of Solon may have left\r\nopen in some degree to the judgment of the reciters, although they were\r\nrequired by it to recite in order.\r\n\r\n6. The dialogue, doubtfully ascribed to Plato under the name of\r\nHipparchus, states that that sovereign--\r\n\r\nτὰ Ὁμήρου πρῶτος ἐκόμισεν ἐς τὴν γῆν ταυτηνὶ, καὶ ἠνάγκασε τοὺς\r\nῥαψῳδοὺς Παναθηναίοις ἐξ ὑπολήψεως ἐφεξῆς αὐτὰ διιέναι, ὥσπερ νῦν ἔτι\r\nοἵδε ποιοῦσι[69].\r\n\r\nAs regards the matter of original introduction, this passage\r\ncontradicts all the foregoing ones. From the uncertainty who is its\r\nauthor, it must yield to them as of less authority. But this is not\r\nall. It is on the very face of it incredible: for it asserts, not that\r\nhis poetry was first arranged or adjusted, but first brought into\r\nthe country by Hipparchus. This is in itself absurd: and it is also\r\ndirectly in the teeth of the statement, which can hardly be a pure\r\nfiction, that Solon by law required the poems of Homer to be recited\r\nat the Panathenæa. As regards the succession in reciting, it is quite\r\npossible that he may have put the last hand to the work of his father.\r\n\r\nHowever, the passage may deserve notice as a sign of the general belief\r\nthat the care of the poems of Homer, and provision for their orderly\r\npublication in the only mode then possible, was a fit and usual part of\r\nthe care of States and their rulers.\r\n\r\nThe whole mass of the passages which have been cited may be thought to\r\nbear primarily on the controversies which I have waived. But they have\r\na most important, even if secondary, bearing upon the question, whether\r\nthe received text is generally sound in its structure. The dangers\r\nwhich menaced that text of course were referable to two sources: the\r\none, want of due care; and the other, falsification for a purpose: and\r\nit is necessary to bring into one view the whole positive evidence\r\nwith respect to the preservation and publication of the Homeric poems,\r\nin order to estimate the amount both of these dangers and of the\r\nsafeguards against them. I resume the prosecution of this task.\r\n\r\nFrom the word ἀγωνίζεσθαι, applied by Herodotus to the recitations at\r\nSicyon, it is plain that they were matches among the rhapsodists. And\r\nas the match did not in the main depend upon the original compositions\r\nof the candidates, but on the repetition of what Homer was reputed to\r\nhave composed, the question arises, on what grounds could the prize be\r\nadjudged? Partly, perhaps, for the voice and manner of the rhapsodist;\r\nbut partly also, nay, we must assume principally, for his comparative\r\nfidelity to the supposed standard of his original. And, when we\r\nconsider the length of the poems, we may the more easily understand\r\nhow the retentiveness of memory required to give an adequate command\r\nof them, might well deserve and receive reward. True, the vanity of\r\na particular rhapsodist might readily induce him to suppose that he\r\ncould improve upon Homer. But surely such an one would be subject to\r\nno inconsiderable check from the vigilance, and the impartial, or\r\nmore probably the jealous, judgment of his contemporaries and rivals.\r\nThe aberrations, too, or interpolations, of each one inventor, would\r\nbe immediately crossed by those of every other; and the intrinsic\r\nsuperiority of the great poet himself, and the extraordinary reverence\r\npaid to his name, would thus derive powerful aid from the natural play\r\nof human passions. I look upon the circumstance that these recitations\r\nwere competitive, and probably open to all comers, as one of the utmost\r\nimportance. Freedom, in such a case, would be far more conservative\r\nthan restriction.\r\n\r\nThe force of such considerations is abated indeed, but it is not\r\ndestroyed, by the fact that poems not composed by Homer were esteemed\r\nto be Homeric. We have no means of knowing whether this false\r\nestimation reached in general beyond the character of mere vulgar\r\nrumour. We find, indeed, that Callinus ascribed the Thebais to Homer,\r\nThucydides the Pythian Hymn, and Aristotle the Margites. But, of these\r\nthree, the last judgment, for all we know, may have been a true one.\r\nThe Thebais was judged by Pausanias to be the best of the epics, after\r\nthe Iliad and Odyssey. It does not therefore follow, that because a\r\npoet might assign this to him, he would also have assigned others. Few\r\nauthors show more slender marks of critical acumen than Herodotus;\r\nbut even he treats the notions that the Cyprian epic or the Epigoni\r\nbelonged to Homer in terms such as to show, that they were at most mere\r\nspeculations, and not established public judgments.[70]\r\n\r\nNow, even in a critical age, it seems to be inevitable, that authors\r\nof conspicuous popularity shall be followed on their path, not only\r\nby imitators, but, where there is the least hope of even temporary\r\nsuccess, by forgers. We see, in the present day, attempts to vent\r\nnew novels under the name of Walter Scott. I have myself a volume,\r\npurchased in Italy, of spurious verses, printed under the name of\r\nher great, though not yet famous, modern poet, Giacomo Leopardi. In\r\nperiods far less critical, impostors would be bolder, and dupes more\r\nnumerous. But it cannot be shown that a number of other epics, or even\r\nthat any single one, had been generally ascribed to Homer with the same\r\nconfidence as the Iliad and Odyssey; nor that the same care, public or\r\nprivate, was taken in any other case for the keeping and restoration of\r\nthe text.\r\n\r\nAgain, though the Spartan and Athenian traditions take no specific\r\nnotice of competition, yet we are justified in supposing that it\r\nexisted, because the practice can be traced to an antiquity more remote\r\nthan any of them. It is true that in Homer we have no example of\r\ncompetition among bards actually exhibited; but neither do the poems\r\nfurnish us with an occasion when it might have been looked for. The\r\nordinary place of the bard was as a member of a king’s or chieftain’s\r\nhousehold. At the great assemblages of tribes, or of the Greek race, to\r\nwhich the chiefs repaired in numbers, more bards than one would also\r\nprobably appear. Some light is thrown upon this subject by the passage\r\nrelating to Thamyris in the second Book of the Iliad.[71] He met his\r\ncalamity at Dorion, when on a journey; and it caught him Οἰχαλίηθεν\r\nἰόντα παρ’ Εὐρύτου Οἰχαλιῆος. Homer’s usual precision justifies our\r\narguing that, when he says he came, not simply from a place, but also\r\nfrom, or from beside, the lord of a place, the meaning is, that he was\r\nattached to that lord as the bard of his court or household. Again,\r\nhe was on a journey. Whither bound, except evidently to one of these\r\ncontests? This is fully shown by the lines that follow, for they\r\ncontemplate a match as then about to take place forthwith. For the\r\nform of his boast was not simply that he could beat the Muses, but (to\r\nspeak in our phraseology) he vauntingly vowed that he would win, even\r\nthough the Muses themselves should be his rivals.\r\n\r\n    στεῦτο γὰρ εὐχόμενος νικήσεμεν, εἴπερ ἂν αὐταὶ\r\n    Μοῦσαι ἀείδοιεν.\r\n\r\nInstitutions which embrace competition have, from the character of\r\nman’s nature, a great self-sustaining power; and there is no reason to\r\nsuppose that between the time of Thamyris and that of the Sicyonian\r\nrhapsodists this method of recitation had at any time fallen into\r\nabeyance. In a fragment of Hesiod[72], quoted by the Scholiast on\r\nPindar, we find the phrase ῥάπτειν ἀοιδήν; but on account of its\r\nmention of Homer as a contemporary, this fragment is untrustworthy.\r\nIn other places, however, he distinctly witnesses to the matches and\r\nprizes of the bards, and says that at the match held by Amphidamas\r\nin Aulis, he himself won a tripod[73]. Again, Thucydides finds an\r\nunequivocal proof of the competition of bards in the beautiful passage\r\nwhich he quotes from the very ancient _Hymn_ to Apollo[74].\r\n\r\nI do not think it needful to dwell in detail upon the means privately\r\ntaken for the transmission of the Homeric songs. Cinæthus of Chios\r\n(according to the Scholiast on Pindar[75], quoting Hippostratus, a\r\nSicilian author of uncertain date), ἐῤῥαψῴδησε τὰ Ὁμήρου ἔπη (about 500\r\nB.C.), for the first time at Syracuse. It may be observed that this\r\npassage may probably imply the foundation of public recitations there.\r\nEustathius[76], quoting, as Heyne[77] observes, inaccurately, charges\r\nCinæthus with having corrupted the Homeric poems; but the words of the\r\nScholiast need not mean more than that he composed certain poems and\r\nthrew them into the mass of those which were more or less taken to be\r\nHomeric. We need not enlarge upon Creophylus[78], or upon the Homeridæ\r\nmentioned by Pindar, and, according to Strabo, claimed as her own by\r\nChios[79]. That name appears to be used freely by Plato[80], without\r\nexplanation, as if in his own time they formed a well-known school.\r\nAccording to Athenæus[81], quoting Aristocles, a writer of uncertain\r\ndate, the name Ὁμηρισταὶ was given to the rhapsodists generally.\r\n\r\nThe Iliad and the Odyssey were known to Herodotus under their present\r\ntitles, as we find from his references to them. But it is justly argued\r\nby Heyne, that there must have been known poems of their scope and\r\nsubject at the time when the other Cyclic poems were written, which\r\nfill up the interval between them, and complete the Troic story[82];\r\nthat is to say, not long after the commencement of the Olympiads.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is needless to do more than simply touch upon the relation\r\nof Homer to Greek letters and culture in general. He was the source\r\nof tragedy, the first text-book of philosophers, and the basis of\r\nliberal education; so much so, that Alcibiades is said to have struck\r\nhis schoolmaster for having no MS. rhapsody of the Iliad[83], while\r\nXenophon quotes Niceratus as saying that his father made him learn\r\nthe Iliad and Odyssey, and that he could repeat the whole of them by\r\nheart[84]. Cassander, king of Macedon, according to Athenæus, could do\r\nnearly as much. He had by heart τῶν ἐπῶν τὰ πολλά.[85]\r\n\r\nPassing on from this evidence of general estimation, I come to what is\r\nmore important with respect to the question of the text--that is, the\r\nstate of the poems at the time of the Alexandrian recensions, as it is\r\nexhibited by Villoison, from the Venetian Scholia on the Iliad which he\r\ndiscovered. From this source appears to me to proceed our best warrant\r\nfor believing in the general soundness of the text.\r\n\r\nThe first tendencies of the Alexandrian school, as they are represented\r\nby Zenodotus, appear to have been towards very free excision and\r\nemendation. Aristarchus, its highest authority, is considered to\r\nrepresent a reaction towards more sober handling. The plan of\r\nexpressing suspicion by _obeli_ was a good one--it raised the question\r\nof genuineness without foreclosing it. The passages which he excluded\r\nstand in the text, and many among them are not much damaged by the\r\ncondemnation. One particularly, in the speech of Phœnix,[86] appears\r\nto me alike beautiful and characteristic. After all, the _obelos_ is\r\ngenerally attached to lines of amplification and poetic ornament;\r\nwhich could be dispensed with, and yet leave the sense not vitally\r\nmutilated. But we may quote Aristarchus as a witness, on the whole,\r\nto the substantial soundness of the text. For it is plain that the\r\naffirmation of all his doubts would still leave us with the substance\r\nof the Iliad as it is; while it seems that the judgment of mankind,\r\nor rather its feeling, which in such a matter is worth more than its\r\njudgment, has refused to go as far as he did, for his doubts or adverse\r\nverdicts are recorded, but the lines and passages remain, are still\r\nread and taught as Homer, and are not pretended to be distinguishable\r\nby any broad mark of intrinsic inferiority. It is not meant that the\r\nsoundness of each line has been considered and affirmed to be free\r\nfrom doubt, but that it has been felt that, while clear discrimination\r\nin detail was impracticable, retention was, on the whole, safer than\r\nexclusion. Nor is this because a principle of blind credulity has\r\nprevailed. On the contrary, the same judgment, feeling, or instinct, be\r\nit what it may, of civilised man, which has found it safest to adhere\r\nto the traditional text of Homer, has likewise thought it safest to\r\nrule the case of authorship adversely as to the Hymns. Under all the\r\ncircumstances, I find no difficulty in understanding such accounts as\r\nthat which tells us that the inquiry, which is the best edition of\r\nHomer? was met with the answer, ‘the oldest;’--or such a passage as\r\nthat of Lucian,[87] who introduces Homer in the Shades, declaring that\r\nthe ἀθετούμεναι στίχες, the suspected and rejected verses, were all\r\nhis; whereupon, says Lucian, I recognised the abundant frigidity of the\r\nschool of Zenodotus and Aristarchus. This is in an ironical work; but\r\nironical works are often used as the vehicles of real opinions.\r\n\r\nThe Venetian Scholiast is full of familiar references to the different\r\neditions of the text of the Iliad, as being standards perfectly well\r\nknown; and he thus exhibits to us, in a considerable degree, the\r\nmaterials which the Alexandrian critics found existing, and with which\r\nthey went to work upon that poem.\r\n\r\nThe multitude of editions (ἐκδόσεις) which they had before them,\r\nwere partly state editions (αἱ πολιτικαὶ, αἱ κατὰ πόλεις, αἱ διὰ τῶν\r\nπόλεων, αἱ ἀπὸ τῶν πόλεων), and partly those due to private care\r\n(οἱ κατ’ ἄνδρα). These latter seem to have obtained the name in two\r\nways. The first was, when it was taken from particular editors who\r\nhad revised the text, such as Antimachus (contemporary with Plato),\r\nCallimachus, and, above all, Aristotle, who prepared for Alexander the\r\nGreat the copy ἐκ νάρθηκος, and, again, the edition of Zenodotus, that\r\nof Aristophanes, and the two separate editions of Aristarchus, all of\r\nthe Alexandrian school; or else they were named from the persons who\r\npossessed them, and for whom they had been prepared by the care of\r\nlearned men. Among such possessors was Cassander, king of Macedonia.\r\n\r\nThe existence of these State editions is a fact full of meaning.\r\nIt appears to show nothing less than this, that the text was under\r\nthe charge of the public authorities in the several States. We have\r\nparticular names for six of these editions through the Venetian\r\nScholiast--those of Marseilles, Chios, Cyprus, Crete, Sinope, Argos. On\r\nbeholding this list, we are immediately struck by the fact that while\r\nit contains names from the far East, like Sinope, and far West, like\r\nMarseilles, it does not contain one name of a city in Greece Proper,\r\nexcept Argos, and that a city having perhaps less communion than almost\r\nany other considerable place with Greek literature in general. We ask\r\nwhy do not Athens, Sparta, Thebes, Corinth, why do not Syracuse and\r\nthe great Greek towns of Sicily and Italy, appear with their several\r\nHomeric texts? The most likely answer appears to be, not that these\r\nsix enumerated cities were more distinguished than others by the\r\ncarefulness of their provisions for the safety of the Homeric text, but\r\nthat for some reason, possibly from their lying less within the circle\r\nof Greek letters at large, they still retained each their particular\r\ntext, whereas an approximation had been made to a common text,--of\r\nwhich the cities most properly Greek in general availed themselves. For\r\nsometimes there are certain signs supplied in the Scholia of a common\r\ntext prevailing in the State or national, and another in the private\r\neditions, and this without reference to the six cities above mentioned.\r\nIn the supposition of such a tendency to divaricate, there is nothing\r\nbeyond likelihood; for private editors would be more free to follow\r\ntheir own judgments or conjectures, whereas the public curators would\r\nalmost, as a matter of course, be more rigidly conservative. At any\r\nrate, there are traceable indications before us to this effect; for the\r\nScholiast cites for particular readings--\r\n\r\n    αἱ ἐκ τῶν πόλεων, xxi. 351.\r\n    αἱ ἀπὸ πόλεων, xxii. 51.\r\n    αἱ ἀπὸ τῶν πόλεων, xix. 386.\r\n\r\nand on the other hand--\r\n\r\n    αἱ κατ’ ἄνδρα, xxii. 103.\r\n\r\nas well as in other places, τινὲς τῶν πολιτικῶν (e. g. xxiv. 30), and\r\nαἱ πλείους τῶν κατ’ ἄνδρα (xxiii. 88). It is therefore likely that\r\nthere was a national text, approximating to uniformity, and used in\r\ncommon by those cities, the principal ones of Greece, which are not\r\nquoted as having had texts of their own; for there is no reason, that\r\nI am aware of, to suppose that the phrases αἱ πολιτικαὶ, and the rest\r\nof those equivalent to it, are confined to the six editions. Now, while\r\nthe six State editions indicate a care probably dating from very early\r\ntimes for the soundness of the text, the common State recension, if,\r\nas appears probable, there was one, indicates a gradual convergence of\r\ncritical labours and of the public judgment in the generality of those\r\nStates, of which the people had the oldest, strongest, and most direct\r\ninterest in the Homeric poems.\r\n\r\nThere is a third form of common text, less perfect than either of the\r\nothers, of which abundant traces are found. We find mention of the\r\neditions or copies called αἱ κοιναὶ, αἱ δημοτικαὶ, αἱ δημώδεις, and\r\nthey are sometimes described collectively, as on Iliad ii. 53, ἐν δὲ\r\nταῖς κοιναῖς ἐγέγραπτο καὶ τῇ Ζηνοδοτείῳ, βουλήν. Sometimes the greater\r\npart of these κοιναὶ or δημώδεις have a particular reading. They all,\r\nof all classes, varied more or less, and are distinguished according\r\nto their merits, as φαυλαὶ, εἰκαιότεραι, μέτριαι, χαριέσταται. These\r\nordinary or public (not national) editions, prepared for sale in\r\nthe open book-market, were probably founded, in the main, on the\r\nnational text, but being intended for general sale, and not prepared\r\nby responsible editors, they were ordinarily inferior. This Venetian\r\nScholiast was himself a critic, and wrote when the Æolic and Ionic\r\ndialects were still in use, as appears from his references to them.[88]\r\n\r\nThe Scholia to the Odyssey supply the names of some editions besides\r\nthose which have been mentioned. One of these is the Αἰολὶς, or\r\nΑἰολική;[89] another is ἡ ἐκ Μουσείου,[90] which is explained to\r\nrefer to the depository near the School at Alexandria; and a third ἡ\r\nΚυκλικὴ,[91] which is interpreted to mean an edition in which the poems\r\nof Homer were placed in a series with those of the Cyclical authors.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, then, it may be readily admitted that the Homeric\r\npoems were exposed, before they were reduced to writing, to the\r\npowerful and various action of disintegrating causes. Among these we\r\nmay name neglect, inability to cope with the real difficulties of their\r\ntransmission, the personal vanity of the rhapsodists, and the local\r\nvanity of communities. But I think we have also disclosed to us, both\r\nby the fragmentary notices of the history of the poems if taken in\r\ntheir collective effect, and by the state of things in and upon which\r\nthe Alexandrian critics laboured, the operation of an immense amount\r\nof restorative counter-agency. All chance of our arriving at a sober\r\njudgment must depend upon our duly weighing these two sets of forces\r\nin their relation to one another. There were indeed tendencies, which\r\nmay well be called irresistible, to aberrations from the traditional\r\nstandard; but there were barriers also insurmountable, which seem to\r\nhave confined those aberrations within certain limits. They could not\r\nproceed beyond a given point without awakening the consciousness,\r\nthat Homer, the priceless treasure of Greece, and perhaps the first\r\nsource of its keener consciousness of nationality, was in danger of\r\nbeing disfigured, and deformed, and so lost; and that sense, when once\r\nawakened, without doubt generated such reactions as we find exemplified\r\nin the proceedings of Pisistratus.\r\n\r\nWe may indeed derive directly, from the force of the destroying\r\nelement, when viewed in detail, the strongest proof that there must\r\nhave been an original standard, by recurrence to which its ravages\r\ncould from time to time be repaired. For if that element had worked\r\nwithout such means of correction, I do not see how we could now have\r\nbeen in possession of an Iliad and an Odyssey. As with regard to\r\nreligions after they are parted from their source, the tendency would\r\nhave been to continually-increasing divergence. The dissimilarities\r\narising from omission, alteration, and interpolation, would have grown,\r\nso as to embrace larger and larger portions of the poems, and at this\r\nday, instead of merely questioning this or that line in a few places,\r\nand comparing this with that reading, we should have been deliberating\r\namong a dozen Iliads and a dozen Odysseys, to discover which were the\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\nIf, then, it be said that the proceedings of Pisistratus or of Solon,\r\nbear testimony not to the soundness but to the incessant corruption\r\nof the text, my answer is, they bear witness to its corruption, just\r\nas the records of the repairs of Westminster Abbey might be said,\r\nand truly said, to bear testimony to its disrepair. That partial and\r\nlocal faults, and dislocations, would creep in, is as certain as that\r\nwind and weather act upon the stoutest fabric: but when we read of\r\nthe repairs of a building, we infer that pains were taken to make it\r\nhabitable; and when we read of the restorations of Homer, we perceive\r\nthat it was an object of public solicitude to keep the poems in a\r\nstate of soundness. As, indeed, the building most used will _cæteris\r\nparibus_ require the most frequent repairs, so the elementary causes of\r\ncorruption, by carelessness, might operate most powerfully in a case\r\nwhere the poet might be recited by every strolling minstrel at a local\r\nfestivity: but it is also clear that in these very cases there would\r\nbe the greatest anxiety to detect and to eliminate the destructive\r\nelements, when once they were seen to be making head. But, in truth,\r\nthe analogy of a building does not represent the case. Edifices are\r\nsometimes disfigured by the parsimony of after-times: but there was no\r\ntime, so far as we know, when Greece did not rate the value of Homer\r\nmore highly than the cost of taking care of him. Again, the architects\r\nof degenerate ages think, as Bernini did of Michael Angelo, that they\r\ncan improve upon their designs: but the name of no Greek has been\r\nrecorded who thought he could improve upon Homer, and the vanity of the\r\nnameless was likely to be checked by their companions and competitors.\r\n\r\nWe have principally had in view the question, whether Homer was, in a\r\npeculiar degree, guarded against any profound and radical corruption\r\nwhich might grow out of unchecked carelessness; but the result will\r\nbe not more unfavourable, if we ask how did he stand in regard to\r\nthe other great fountain-head of evil, namely, falsification with a\r\npurpose? Now, the fact, that in any given case provision is made for\r\njealous custody against any attack from without, affords no proof, or\r\neven presumption, against the subsistence of destroying causes within.\r\nBut the Greeks, as a nation, had no motive to corrupt, and had every\r\nmotive to preserve the text of Homer. His national office and position\r\nhave been admirably expressed by Statius, in verses on the Trojan\r\nexpedition:--\r\n\r\n                          Tum primùm Græcia vires\r\n    Contemplata suas: tum sparsa ac dissona moles,\r\n    In corpus vultumque coït[92].\r\n\r\nHis works were the very cradle of the nation; there it first visibly\r\nlived and breathed. They were the most perfect expression of every\r\nGreek feeling and desire: in the rivalry between the Hellenic race and\r\nthe (afterwards so called) βάρβαροι of Asia, they gave, in forms the\r\nmost effective and the most artful, everything worth having to the\r\nformer, and left the later Greek nothing to add. What void to be filled\r\ncould even vanity discover, when so many Greek chieftains, inferior,\r\nin a degree never measured, to Achilles, were, nevertheless, each of\r\nthem, too strong for the prince of Trojan warriors?\r\n\r\nBut it may perhaps be replied that, even supposing that collective\r\nGreece could gain nothing by corrupting Homer, yet the relative\r\ndistribution of honour among the principal States might be affected to\r\nthe profit of one and the prejudice of another. Now it is plain that,\r\nin this delicate and vital point, the sectional jealousies of the\r\nGreeks would afford the best possible security to the general contents\r\nof the text: something of the same security that the hatred of the Jews\r\nand the Samaritans supplied, when they became rival guardians of the\r\nbooks of the Old Testament. Argos, deeply interested for Diomed, and\r\nLacedæmon for Menelaus, and both for Agamemnon, were watchmen alike\r\npowerful and keen against Athens, if she had attempted to obtain for\r\nherself in the Iliad a place at all proportioned to her after-fame.\r\nThere were numerous parts of Homer’s Greece, both great and small,\r\nthat fell into subsequent insignificance, such as Pylos, Ithaca,\r\nSalamis, Locris: the relative positions of Thessaly and Southern Greece\r\nwere fundamentally changed in the historic times. But all, whether\r\nthey exulted in the longlived honours of their States, or whether\r\nthey fondly brooded on the recollections of former fame, were alike\r\ninterested in resisting interlopers who might seek to trespass for\r\ntheir own advantage, as well as in the general object of preserving\r\nthe priceless national monument from decay. Nor is there any room to\r\nsuppose, that these questions of primeval honour were indifferent to\r\nthe later Greeks. The citation from the Catalogue by the Athenian\r\nenvoys before Gelon in Herodotus (to take a single instance), affords\r\nconclusive proof to the contrary: and, even so late as in the day\r\nof Pausanias, he tells us that Argolis and Arcadia were the States,\r\nwhich even then were still keenly disputing with Athens the palm of\r\nautochthonism.\r\n\r\nIt, therefore, appears to me that the presumptions of the case are on\r\nthe whole favourable, and not adverse, to the general soundness of the\r\nHomeric text.\r\n\r\nI confess myself to be very greatly confirmed in this view of the\r\npresumptions, by the scarcely measurable amount of internal evidence\r\nwhich the text supplies to substantiate its own integrity. Almost the\r\nwhole of the copious materials which recent writers have accumulated to\r\nprove the unity and personality of the author, is available to show the\r\nsoundness of the text. The appeal need not be only to the undisturbed\r\nstate of the main _strata_ of the poems, the consistent structure\r\nand relations of the facts; the general _corpus_ of the poems might\r\nhave been sound, and yet a bad text would, when subjected to a very\r\nsearching ordeal on the minutest points, have revealed a multitude of\r\nsolecisms and errors: but, instead of this, the rigid application of\r\nthe microscope has only shown more clearly a great perfection in the\r\nworkmanship. The innumerable forms of refined and delicate coincidence\r\nin names and facts, in the use of epithets, the notes of character,\r\nthe turn of speeches and phrases, and the like, are so many rills of\r\nevidence, which combine into a stream of resistless force, in favour of\r\nthat text which has been found so admirably, as a mirror, to reflect\r\nthe image and the mind of Homer, and which, like a mirror, could not\r\nhave reflected it truly unless it had itself been true.\r\n\r\nIndeed, I must proceed a step further; and admit that the arguments\r\n_ab extra_, which I have here put forward respecting the historic aims\r\nof the poet, his proximity in time to his subject, and the probable\r\nsoundness of the text, are rather answers to objections, than the\r\nadequate materials of affirmative conviction.\r\n\r\nAfter having myself tested the text as to its self-consistency and\r\notherwise, in several thousand places, I find scarcely one or two\r\nplaces in each thousand, where it seems to invite expurgation in order\r\nto establish the consistency of its contents. The evidence on which\r\nI really place reliance is experimental evidence: and that I find in\r\nthe poems, accumulated to a degree which no other human work within my\r\nknowledge approaches. I do not presume to hope more than that the more\r\nremote and general arguments, which have now been used, may assist in\r\nremoving preliminary barriers to the consideration of the one cardinal\r\nand paramount argument, the text itself and its contents.\r\n\r\nAnd here a brief reference must be made to the scepticism in miniature\r\nwhich has replaced the more sweeping incredulity of Wolf and his\r\nschool. Editors of great weight, refusing to accompany even the\r\nChorizontes in separating the authorship of the poems, nevertheless\r\nfreely condemn particular passages. I do not deny that there are\r\nvarious passages, of which the genuineness is fair matter for\r\ndiscussion. But I confess that I find such grounds of excision, as\r\nthose commonly alleged by critics recommending it, very indeterminate,\r\nand of a nature to leave it doubtful where their operation is to stop.\r\nThey generally involve arbitrary assumptions either of construction\r\nor of history, or the application of a more rigid and literal rule\r\nof consistency than poetry either requires or can endure, or else\r\nthe capital error, as I cannot but consider it, of bringing Homer\r\nto be tried at the bar of later and inferior traditions. And there\r\nis a want of common principles, a general insecurity of standing\r\nground, and an appearance of reforming Homer not according to any\r\nacknowledged laws of criticism, but according to the humour of each\r\naccomplished and ingenious man: which, in a matter of this weight,\r\nis no sufficient guarantee. I therefore follow in the line of those,\r\nwhose recommendation is to draw every thing we can out of the present\r\ntext; and to see how far its contents may constitute a substantive and\r\nconsistent whole, in the various branches of information to which they\r\nrefer. When we have carried this process as far as it will bear, we may\r\nfind, first that many or some of the seeming discordancies are really\r\nembraced within a comprehensive general harmony, and secondly that\r\nwith a fuller knowledge of the laws of that harmony we may ourselves\r\nbe in a condition at least of less incapacity to pronounce what is\r\nHomeric and what is not. I will only say that were I to venture into\r\nthis field of criticism, I should be governed less than is usual by\r\ndiscrepancies of fact often very hastily assumed; and much more than is\r\nusual by any violence done to the finer analogies of which Homer is so\r\nfull, and by departures from his regular modes of thought, feeling, and\r\nrepresentation.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[42] Il. vi. 445-64; xii. 10-33; xv. 384.\r\n\r\n[43] Heyne, Exc. ii. ad Il.

I mean, that it is an error\r\nto regard and accept all ancient traditions, relating to the periods\r\nthat precede regular historic annals, as of equal value, or not to\r\ndiscriminate their several values with adequate care. Above all, I\r\nstrongly contend that we should assign to the Homeric evidence a\r\nprimary rank upon all the subjects which it touches, and that we should\r\nmake it a rule to reduce all other literary testimony, because of later\r\norigin, to a subordinate and subsidiary position.\r\n\r\nMere rumours or stories of the pre-historic times are not, as such,\r\nentitled to be called traditions. A story of this kind, say in\r\nApollodorus, may indeed by bare possibility be older than any thing in\r\nHomer; but if it comes to us without the proper and visible criteria\r\nof age, it has no claim upon our assent as a truthful record of the\r\ntime to which it purports to refer. Traditions of this class only grow\r\nto be such, as a general rule, for us, at the time when they take a\r\npositive form in the work of some author, who thus becomes, as far as\r\nhis time and circumstances permit, a witness to them. It is only from\r\nthenceforward, that their faithful derivation and transmission can be\r\nrelied on as in any degree probable.\r\n\r\nAgain, I cast aside statements with respect to which the poet, being\r\ncarried beyond the sphere of his ordinary experience, must, on that\r\naccount, not be presumed to speak historically; yet even here, if he is\r\nspeaking of matters which were in general belief, he is a witness of\r\nthe first class with respect to that belief, which is itself in another\r\nsense a matter of history; and here also those, who have followed him\r\nat a remote date, are witnesses of a lower order.\r\n\r\nOr there may be cases, as, for instance, in the stubborn facts of\r\ngeography, where the laws of evidence compel us rudely to thrust aside\r\nthe declaration of the bard; or cases where his mode of handling his\r\nmaterials affords in itself a proof that he did not mean to speak\r\nhistorically, but, in the phrase of Aristotle, ἐκπληκτικῶς, or for\r\npoetic effect.\r\n\r\nOr again, it is conceivable, though I do not know whether it has\r\nhappened, that Homeric testimony might come into conflict, not with\r\nmere counter-assertion, but with those forms of circumstantial evidence\r\nwhich are sometimes conclusively elicited by reasoning from positive\r\n_data_ of architecture, language, and ethnology. I claim for Homer no\r\nexemption from the more cogent authority which may attach to reasoning\r\nof this kind.\r\n\r\nClearing the question of these incumbrances, I wish to submit to\r\nthe suffrages of those, who may be more competent than myself to\r\nestimate both the proposition and the proof, the following thesis:\r\nthat, in regard to the religion, history, ethnology, polity, and life\r\nat large of the Greeks of the heroic times, the authority of the\r\nHomeric poems, standing far above that of the whole mass of the later\r\nliterary traditions in any of their forms, ought never to be treated\r\nas homogeneous with them, but should usually, in the first instance,\r\nbe handled by itself, and the testimony of later writers should, in\r\ngeneral, be handled in subordination to it, and should be tried by it,\r\nas by a touchstone, on all the subjects which it embraces.\r\n\r\nIt is generally admitted that Homer is older by some generations than\r\nHesiod, by many than the authors of the Cyclical Poems; and older\r\nby many centuries than the general mass of our authorities on Greek\r\nantiquity, beginning with Æschylus and Herodotus, and coming down to\r\nDionysius of Halicarnassus, Diodorus Siculus, Strabo, Ælian, Pausanias,\r\nDiogenes Laertius. Nor is it by time alone, that his superior proximity\r\nand weight are to be measured. Of all the ages that have passed since\r\nHomer, it may be truly said that not one has produced a more acute,\r\naccurate, and comprehensive observer. But, above all, writing of the\r\nheroic time, he, and he alone, writes like one who, as from internal\r\nevidence we may confidently assert, stood within its precinct, and was\r\nimbued from head to foot with its spirit and its associations.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, quite possible, that in one particular or another,\r\nHomer may be in error, and the later tradition, it is also just\r\npossible, may be correct. But so, also, the evidence of an eye-witness\r\nin a court of justice may be erroneous, while by chance the merest\r\nhearsay may be true. This does not divert men from a careful\r\nclassification of evidence according to its presumptive value, where\r\nthey have purposes of utility, according to the common and limited\r\nsense of the term, in their view. In regard to the early Greek history,\r\nthe practice has often been otherwise; partly in the works of scholars,\r\nand yet more, as we might expect, in the more popular forms of tuition.\r\nIt has been to lump together the heterogeneous mass of traditions\r\nembodied in the literature of a thousand years. All that the sport of\r\nfancy and imagination had conceived--all that national, or local, or\r\npersonal vanity had suggested--all that motives of policy had forged in\r\nhistory or religion--or so much of this aggregate as time has spared\r\nto us, has been treated without any systematic recognition of the\r\ndifferent value of different orders of tradition. I admit that it is\r\ntowards the close of the Greek literature that we find the principal\r\nprofessed inquirers into antiquity; and their aim and method may have\r\nredressed, in great part, any inequality between themselves and writers\r\nof the time of Thucydides or Plato. But nothing can cancel, nothing, it\r\nmight almost be said, can narrow, the enormous interval, in point of\r\nauthority, between Homer, who sang in the heroic age, and those who not\r\nonly collected their materials, but formed their thoughts, after it was\r\nclosed, and after its floating reminiscences had become subject to the\r\nincessant action of falsifying processes.\r\n\r\nFor a length of time the temper of our ancient histories was one of\r\nunquestioning reception. But where much was self-contradictory, all\r\ncould not be believed. Under these circumstances, it was not unnatural\r\nthat those writers who were full and systematic, should be preferred,\r\nrather than that the labour should be undergone of gathering gold in\r\ngrains from the pages of Homer, of carefully collecting facts and\r\npresumptions singly from the text, and then again estimating the amount\r\nand effect of their bearings upon one another. Hence the Catalogues\r\nof Apollodorus, or the downright assertions of Scholiasts, have\r\nbeen allowed to give form to our early histories of Greece; and the\r\nauthentic, but usually slighter notices of Homer, have received little\r\nattention, except where, in some detail or other, they might suit\r\nthe argument which each particular writer happened to have in hand.\r\nAgain, because Herodotus was by profession an historian and nothing\r\nelse (at least, I can discern no better reason), more importance\r\nseems to be attached to his notices of prior ages than to the less\r\nformally presented notices of Homer, who, according to the statement of\r\nHerodotus himself, preceded him by four hundred years. I do not mean\r\nby this remark to imply that Herodotus and Homer are particularly at\r\nvariance with one another, but only to illustrate what seems to me a\r\nprevailing source of error.\r\n\r\nIn general, where the traditions reported by the later writers are\r\npreferred to those of Homer, it is perhaps because, although they may\r\nconflict with probability as well as with one another in an infinity\r\nof points, yet they are in themselves more systematic and complete.\r\nThey represent to us for the most part _pasticcios_ arbitrarily made up\r\nof materials of unequal value, but yet made up into wholes; whereas,\r\nthe evidence which he supplies is original though it is fragmentary.\r\nHad he been followed by a continuous succession of authors, we should,\r\nno doubt, do wisely in consenting to view the subjects of fact, with\r\nwhich he dealt, mainly as they were viewed by those who trod in his\r\nsteps. But, on the contrary, they were separated from him by a gulf\r\nboth wide and deep; over which his compositions floated, in despite\r\nof difficulties so great that many have deemed them positively\r\ninsurmountable, only by their extraordinary buoyancy.\r\n\r\nIt is in the Cyclic poems that we should naturally seek for materials\r\nto enlarge, expound, or correct Homer. But there is not a line or a\r\nnotice remaining of any one of them, which would justify our assigning\r\nto them any historical authority sufficient to qualify them for such a\r\npurpose. Their reputed authors, from Arctinus downwards, all belong to\r\nperiods within the dates of the Olympiads[93]. They all bear marks of\r\nhaving been written to fill the gaps which Homer had left unoccupied,\r\nand so to enter into a partnership, if not with his fame, yet with his\r\npopularity; with the popularity, of which his works, as we can well\r\njudge from more recent experience, would be sure to shed some portion\r\nupon all compositions ostensibly allied with them, and which then, as\r\nnow, presented the most cogent inducements to imitators who had their\r\nlivelihood to seek by means of their Muse.\r\n\r\nHomer, without doubt, gave an immense addition of celebrity and vogue\r\nto the subject of the Trojan war, much as Boiardo and Ariosto did to\r\nthe whole circle of the romances of which Orlando is the centre. One\r\nof these poems, the Ἰλίου Πέρσις, is a simple expansion, as Mure has\r\nobserved[94], of the third lay of Demodocus in the Eighth Odyssey[95].\r\nThey seem to bear the mark of being, not composed first-hand from\r\nactions of men, but from a stock of compositions in which heroic\r\nactions had already been enshrined; so little do they appear to have\r\nbeen stamped with the individuality which denotes original design. And\r\naccordingly the usual manner of quoting them is not as the certain\r\nworks of a given person, but the form of citation is (ὁ γράψας τὴν\r\nμικρὰν Ἰλιάδα, ὁ ποιήσας τὰ Κύπρια ἔπη), the writer of the little\r\nIliad, the composer of the Cyprian Songs, and the like. Heyne[96] holds\r\neven the commencement of the Cyclic poems to have been at least a\r\ncentury after the date of the Iliad and Odyssey.\r\n\r\nMr. Fynes Clinton, whose name can never be mentioned without a grateful\r\nrecognition of his merits and services, supplies, in the early part\r\nof his Fasti Hellenici, many valuable suggestions for the sifting of\r\nearly Greek history. But he nowhere acknowledges, or approaches (I\r\nbelieve) to the acknowledgment of the rule, that for the heroic age\r\nthe authority of Homer stands alone in kind. In the Fasti Hellenici\r\nmany statements, dating long after Homer, are delivered as if of\r\nequal authority with his in regard to the history of that age; and\r\nMr. Clinton seems to have been led into a snare, to which his duty\r\nas a chronologer probably exposed him, in assuming that history\r\nand chronology may be expected to begin together; an assumption, I\r\napprehend, not supported by probability. Mr. Mitford has admirably\r\npointed out the importance of veracity to Homer’s function, and to his\r\nfame as a poet, at a time when a poet could be the only historian[97],\r\nthe probability and singular consistency of his scattered anecdotes,\r\nand the remarkable contrast between the clearness of his history, and\r\nthe darkness and uncertainty which follow after him, and continue until\r\nthe historic age begins; nor does he scruple to declare that ‘for these\r\nearly ages Homer is our best guide[98].’ But even this is still short\r\nof my desire, which is not merely to recognise him as _primus inter\r\npares_, but to treat his testimony as paramount, and as constituting a\r\nclass by itself, with which no other literary testimony can compete.\r\nAnd so once more Bishop Marsh, in his able work on the Pelasgi, assigns\r\nno special office, I might perhaps say no peculiar weight, to the\r\nHomeric testimony.\r\n\r\nBut I am glad to shelter myself under the authority afforded me by the\r\npractice of Buttmann, who, in the Preface to his admirable Lexilogus,\r\ndeclares his rule of philological investigation in Homer to be this:\r\nto take, first, the evidence of the text itself in its several parts;\r\nsecondly, that of the succeeding epic poetry, and along with this\r\nthe testimony of the prime after-ages of Greek literature; thirdly,\r\ngrammatical tradition.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the extensive contrariety between the old and the new is\r\nadmitted. ‘The Iliad and the Odyssey,’ says Mr. Grote[99], ‘and the\r\nremaining Hesiodic fragments, exhibit but too frequently a hopeless\r\ndiversity, when confronted with the narratives of the logographers.’\r\nAnd the author of the Minos[100] cleared away the fabulous and defaming\r\naccounts of that sovereign, to return to the representations of Homer\r\nand of Hesiod; καίτοι γε πιθανώτεροί εἰσιν ἢ σύμπαντες οἱ τραῳδοποιοὶ,\r\nὧν συ ἀκούων ταῦτα λέγεις. The great ancient writers, indeed, seem\r\nnever to have questioned the authority of Homer as a witness; nor\r\ncould any one wish to see him enthroned at a greater elevation than\r\nthat assigned to him as late as in the pages of Strabo. Virgil\r\nsystematically made light of him, but he was in a manner compelled by\r\nhis subject to make light of historical veracity altogether.\r\n\r\nHistorical scepticism, which has come of late years into possession of\r\nthe ground, has not redressed, as affecting Homer, the wrong that had\r\nbeen done by historical credulity. We once exalted into history the\r\ngeneral mass of traditions relating to the ages which next preceded\r\nthose of continuous historic records; we now again decline the labour\r\nof discrimination, and reduce them all alike into legend. The name of\r\nMr. Grote must carry great weight in any question of Greek research:\r\nbut it may be doubted whether the force and aptitude of his powerful\r\nmind have been as successfully applied to the Homeric as to the later\r\nperiods. He presents us, indeed, with even more goodly and copious\r\ncatalogues than historians are wont of Æolids, of Pelopids, of ruling\r\nfamilies in every corner of Greece, and from the earliest times; but\r\nhe, too, fixes a chronological point for the commencement of history,\r\nnamely, the first recorded Olympiad[101]. He seems to think that the\r\ntrustworthy chronology of Greece begins before its real history. He\r\ndeclines to take his start from disinterred Pelasgi[102]; he conceives\r\nthat we have no other authority for the existence of Troy than we have\r\nfor the theogonic revolutions[103]; the immense array of early names\r\nthat he presents are offered as names purely legendary. He will not\r\nattempt to determine how much or how little of history these legends\r\nmay contain; he will not exhibit a picture from behind the curtain,\r\nbecause, as he forcibly says, the curtain is the picture, and cannot by\r\nany ingenuity be withdrawn[104]. He deals in the main alike with Homer,\r\nHesiod, the tragedians and minor Greek poets, the scattered notices\r\nof the historians, of the antiquarian writers near the Christian era,\r\nand of the Scholiasts. Of course, therefore, he cannot be expected\r\nto rectify the fault, if such there has been, in regard to the\r\nappreciation of the poems of Homer.\r\n\r\nI may, however, observe that in this, as in other cases, extremes\r\nappear to meet. Attempts to winnow the legendary lore, and to separate\r\nthe historic or primitive kernel from the husk, were clearing the\r\nstage of a multitude of mythical personages unknown to the earliest\r\ntradition; all of whom now are ushered in once more; they are, indeed,\r\nlabelled as unhistorical; but they are again mixed up wholesale with\r\nthose, from whose company critical observation had expelled them. In\r\nthus reimparting a promiscuous character to the first scenes of Grecian\r\nhistory, we seem to effect a retrogressive and not a progressive\r\noperation. At any rate it should be understood that the issue raised\r\nembraces the question, whether the personality of Achilles and\r\nAgamemnon has no better root in history than that of Pelasgus, of\r\nPrometheus, or of Hellen. And again, whether all these, being equal\r\nto one another, are likewise equal, and no more than equal, in credit\r\nto Ceres, Bacchus, or Apollo. As to all alike, what proportion of\r\ntruth there may be in the legend, or whether any, ‘it is impossible\r\nto ascertain, and useless to inquire[105];’ all alike belong to a\r\nregion, essentially mythical, neither approachable by the critic, nor\r\nmeasurable by the chronologer.\r\n\r\nIf the opinions which have been here expressed are in any degree\r\ncorrect, we must endeavour to recover as substantial personages, and\r\nto bring within the grasp of flesh and blood some of those pictures,\r\nand even of those persons, whom Mr. Grote has dismissed to the land of\r\nShadow and of Dream.\r\n\r\nIn this view, the earliest Greek history should be founded on the text\r\nof Homer, and not merely on its surface, but on its depths. Not only\r\nits more broad and obvious statements should be registered, but we\r\nshould search and ransack all those slighter indications, suggestions,\r\nand sources of inference, in which it is so extraordinarily rich;\r\nand compel it, as it were, to yield up its treasures. We cannot,\r\nindeed, like the zoologist, say the very words, Give me the bone, and\r\nI will disinter the animal; yet so accurately was the mind of Homer\r\nconstructed, that we may come nearer to this certainty in dealing\r\nwith him, than with any other child of man. The later and inferior\r\nevidence should be differently handled, and should not be viewed as\r\nintrinsically authoritative. But that portion of it, which fills up the\r\ngaps or confirms the suggestions of Homer, becomes thereby entitled\r\nto something of historic rank. Again, widely extended and uniformly\r\ncontinued traditions may amount to proof of notoriety, and may, not\r\nby their individual credit, but by their concurrence, supply us with\r\nstanding ground of tolerable firmness. Beyond all this we may proceed,\r\nand may present to view, where for any cause it seems desirable, even\r\nill-supported legends, but always as such, with fair notice of any\r\ncircumstances which may tend to fix their credit or discredit, and\r\nwith a line sufficiently marked between these and the recitals which\r\nrest upon Homeric authority. Thus, the general rule would be to begin\r\nwith Homer: _a Jove principium_. We should plant his statements each\r\nin their place, as so many foundation stones. While he leads us by the\r\nhand, we should tread with comparative confidence; when we quit his\r\nguidance, we should proceed with caution, with mistrust, with a tone no\r\nhigher than that of speculation and avowed conjecture.\r\n\r\nIn many instances, the application of these principles will require\r\nthe rudiments of early Greek history to be recast. In illustration of\r\nthis statement, I will refer to a legend, which has heretofore been\r\npopularly assumed as in a great degree the ethnological starting point\r\nof Greek history.\r\n\r\nThe current ideas respecting the distribution of the Greek races are\r\nfounded upon the supposition that there was a certain Hellen, and that\r\nhe had three sons, Dorus, Æolus, and Xuthus, the last of whom died and\r\nleft behind him two sons, Ion and Achæus. This Hellen was (so runs the\r\nstory) the son of Deucalion, and Deucalion was the son of Prometheus,\r\nand the husband of Pyrrha, who again was the daughter of Epimetheus\r\nand of Pandora, the first-made woman. From the agency of Deucalion and\r\nPyrrha, the human race took a new commencement after the Deluge. The\r\nnation at large were called Hellenes, after Hellen; and from his two\r\nsurviving sons, and his grandsons Ion and Achæus, were named the four\r\ngreat branches of the common stem. Such is the legend as it stands in\r\nApollodorus[106]; and that part of it which describes Hellen and his\r\nthree sons, but no more, is found in a fragment of Hesiod, quoted by\r\nTzetzes on Lycophron[107].\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that any one, setting about the invention of a story with\r\nthe compound purpose, first, of uniting the Greeks in a common bond of\r\nrace; secondly, of referring them to a common country as their cradle;\r\nand, thirdly, of carrying up their origin to an extreme antiquity,\r\ncould hardly have done better than invent this tale. And that, which\r\nmight have been done at a stroke by an individual mind, was done no\r\nless effectually by the common thought and wish of the Greek people\r\nmoulding itself by degrees into tradition. The tale has a symmetry\r\nabout it, most suggestive of design and invention. How clearly it\r\nconnects all the celebrated families or groups of the Greek nation;\r\nwith what accuracy it fixes their relation to the common stem; and with\r\nhow much impartial consideration for the self-love of every one among\r\nthem, and for their several shares of fame.\r\n\r\nNot only in general, but even in detail, we may watch the gradual\r\nformation of this tradition adapting itself to the state of Greece.\r\nIn Homer we find no Hellenes greatly distinguished, except Æolids\r\nand Achæans. This is the first stage. But when the Dorians attain\r\nto power[108], they claim a share in the past answerable to their\r\npredominance in the present: and they receive accordingly the first\r\nplace in the genealogy as it stands in Hesiod, where Dorus is the\r\nfirst-named among the three sons of Hellen. The Achæans, now in\r\ndepression, do not appear as Hellenes at all. But with the lapse of\r\ntime the Ionians of Athens, becoming powerful, desire to be also\r\nfamous: therefore room must be made for them: and the Achæans too\r\nby their local intermixture with the same race, and their political\r\nsympathy with Athens, once more come to be entitled to notice: Xuthus\r\naccordingly, in the final form of the tradition is provided with two\r\nsons. Ion and Achæus, and now all the four branches have each their\r\nrespective place.\r\n\r\nThis tradition, however, is neither in whole nor in part sustained by\r\nHomer, and can by no effort be made to fit into Homer; to say nothing\r\nof its containing within itself much incongruity. If we exclude Xuthus,\r\nas a mere mute, it gives us five persons as the eponymists of five\r\nraces, the four last included in the first. But of the five persons\r\nthus placed upon the stage, Homer gives us but one; that one, Æolus,\r\nhas no race or tribe, but only two or three lines of descendants\r\nnamed after him. Again, the two or three children of Æolus in Homer\r\nbecome five in Hesiod, twelve in Apollodorus, and by additions from\r\nother writers reach a respectable total of seventeen[109]. Thus as\r\nto persons, Homer has indeed an Æolus, but he has no Hellen, no\r\nDorus, no Ion, no Achæus. Now as to races. He mentions, without doubt,\r\nHellenes, Achæans, Dorians, Ionians; but affords hardly any means of\r\nidentifying Dorians with Hellenes, and as to Ionians, supplies pretty\r\nstrong presumptions that they were not Hellenic[110]. Nor does he\r\nestablish any relation whatever between any of the four races and any\r\ncommon ancestor or eponymist. Again, the Deucalion of this legend is\r\ntwo generations before its Æolus; but the Deucalion of Homer, who may\r\nbe reckoned as three generations before the fall of Troy, is also three\r\ngenerations later than his Æolus. In fact, this legend of Hellen and\r\nhis family is like an ugly and flimsy, but formal, modern house, built\r\nby the sacrilegious collection of the fragments of a noble ruin.\r\n\r\nIt may be thought dangerous, however, in setting up the authority\r\nof Homer, to pull down that of Hesiod, who comes nearest to him.\r\nBut, firstly, Hesiod is only responsible for so much of the legend\r\nas connects two persons named Æolus and Dorus with Hellen as their\r\nsource; which is at any rate no more than a poetical dress given to an\r\nhypothesis substantially not in conflict with the Homeric traditions.\r\nSecondly, as respects literal truth, the name Hellen at once bears\r\nthe strongest evidence against its own pretensions to an historical\r\ncharacter such as that assigned to it, because its etymology refers it\r\nto the territorial name Ἑλλὰς, and through this to the national name\r\nἝλλοι[111]. Lastly, the essential difference in point of authority lies\r\nbetween Homer and Hesiod, not between Homer together with Hesiod on\r\nthe one side, and those who came after Hesiod on the other. Homer was\r\nfully within the sphere and spirit of the heroic age; Hesiod was as\r\nplainly outside it. He is apparently separated from the mighty master\r\nby a considerable term, even as measured in years. That term it would\r\nbe difficult to define by any given number; but it is easy to see that\r\neven when defined it would convey an utterly inadequate idea of the\r\ninterval of poetic and personal difference, and of moral and social\r\nchange, between Hesiod and Homer. It is not to be found in this or that\r\nvariation, for it belongs to the whole order of ideas; all the elements\r\nof thought, the whole tone of the picture, the atmosphere in which\r\npersons and objects are seen, are essentially modified.\r\n\r\nI venture one remark, however, upon Hesiod’s very beautiful account of\r\nthe Ages. None can fail to be struck by the order in which he places\r\nthem. Beginning with the Golden, he comes next to the Silver age, and\r\nthen to Brass. But, instead of descending forthwith the fourth and last\r\nstep to the Iron age, he very singularly retraces his steps, and breaks\r\nthe downward chain by an age of heroes, of whom he says that it was\r\n\r\n                  δικαιότερον καὶ ἄρειον,\r\n    ἀνδρῶν ἡρώων θεῖον γένος, οἱ καλέονται\r\n    ἡμίθεοι προτέρῃ γενεᾷ κατ’ ἀπείρονα γαῖαν[112].\r\n\r\nThese, he goes on to explain, were the men, partly slain in the Theban\r\nand Trojan wars, partly translated by Jupiter to the ends of the earth,\r\nthe islands of the blest. After this, the scale drops, at once, to the\r\nlowest point, the Iron age, the age without either Νέμεσις or Αἰδὼς,\r\nthe age of sheer wickedness and corruption.\r\n\r\nThis very curious turn in the arrangement of the Hesiodic Ages, and\r\nespecially the insertion, in a regular figurative series taken from the\r\nmetals, of a completely heterogeneous passage, calls for explanation;\r\nand I venture to suggest that this passage should be construed as\r\ndisclosing to us that brilliant halo, which the Homeric poems had cast\r\nover an age still recent, so as not only to hold it above the one that\r\nfollowed, but also to raise it even above that which had preceded it;\r\nabove the age of Bellerophon, of Tantalus, of Sisyphus, of Minos, and\r\neven of Hercules. The splendour of the fame of heroes really depended\r\non the Bard. The great Bard of Greece had lifted Achilles and Ulysses\r\nto a height surpassing that of the older Heroes, who remained unsung\r\nby him; and he had promised Menelaus, in the Fourth Odyssey[113],\r\nthat very seat in the regions of the blest, to which allusion is here\r\nmade by Hesiod. While the apparent poetic solecism of this passage is\r\nthus accounted for, it becomes, at once, both an emphatic testimony\r\nto the immense power exercised by the verse of Homer, and a distinct\r\ndeclaration by Hesiod of the wide social interval, by which he was\r\nhimself separated from the heroic period; a declaration entirely\r\naccordant with the internal evidence of the poems of Hesiod generally,\r\nand amounting by implication to the double statement from this poet,\r\nthat Homer belonged to the heroic age, and that he himself did not\r\nbelong to it.\r\n\r\nThe tradition of Hellen and his sons, then, exhibits one of the cases\r\nin which we must take our choice between the testimony of Homer, and\r\nwhat are apparently the inventions of the later Greeks.\r\n\r\nAnother of these cases, which will be my second and last illustration,\r\nrelates to Helen of Troy.\r\n\r\nIt has been much disputed whether this celebrated character is to be\r\nregarded as historical or fictitious. A writer of no less judgment\r\nand authority than the Bishop of St. David’s, adopts the latter\r\nalternative, upon various grounds. The strongest among them all, in\r\nhis view, is, that ‘in the abduction of Helen, Paris only repeats an\r\nexploit, also attributed to Theseus[114].’ This exploit, the Bishop\r\nthinks, was known to Homer, as he introduces Æthra, the mother of\r\nTheseus, in the company of Helen at Troy. And other writers have\r\nfurther developed these ideas, by finding absurdity in the Homeric tale\r\nof Helen, on the ground that she must have been eighty years old when\r\nthe supposed abduction by Paris took place.\r\n\r\nNow, the basis of these statements entirely depends upon the assumption\r\nthat the later traditions are entitled to be treated either as upon\r\na par, or, at any rate, as homogeneous with those of Homer. The\r\ntradition which assigns a rape of Helen to Theseus, is only available\r\nto discredit the tale of Homer, on the supposition that it rests upon\r\nauthority like that of Homer. But if it was a late invention, then it\r\nis more probably to be regarded as a witness to the fame of the Homeric\r\npersonages, and the anxiety of Attica to give her hero the advantage\r\nof similar embellishments, than as an original tradition which Homer\r\ncopied, or as a twin report with that which he has handed down.\r\n\r\nThe tradition of the rape of Helen by Theseus is mentioned by\r\nHerodotus[115] as a tale current among the Athenians. He testifies\r\napparently to the fact, that the Deceleans of Attica enjoyed certain\r\nimmunities in Sparta, and were spared by the Lacedæmonian forces when\r\nthey invaded Attica; which was ascribed by the Athenians to their\r\nhaving assisted in the recovery of Helen from Theseus, by pointing out\r\nto the Tyndaridæ the place of her concealment. Herodotus, however,\r\ndoes not affirm the cause stated by the Athenians, nor the abduction\r\nby Theseus, which afterwards became, or had even then become, an\r\nestablished tradition. Isocrates[116] handles it without misgiving, and\r\nit is methodized in Plutarch, with a multitude of other particulars,\r\nour acceptance of which absolutely requires the rejection of Homer’s\r\nhistorical authority.\r\n\r\nAnd so again with regard to Æthra, the daughter of Pittheus, whom the\r\nlater ages have connected with Theseus. We have no right to treat her\r\nintroduction in the company of Helen[117], as a proof that Homer knew\r\nof a story connecting Helen with Theseus, unless we knew, which we do\r\nnot, from Homer, or from authority entitled to compete with Homer, that\r\nthere was a relation between Æthra and Theseus.\r\n\r\nNow, the story of Homer respecting Helen, is perfectly self-consistent:\r\nand so is his story respecting Theseus: but the two are separated by\r\nan interval of little less than two generations, or say fifty years.\r\nFor Theseus[118] fought in the wars against the Φῆρες, in which Nestor\r\ntook part: and he wooed and wedded Ariadne, the aunt of Idomeneus, who\r\nwas himself nearly or quite one generation older than the Greek kings\r\nin general. On the other hand, Homer shows the age of Helen to have\r\nbeen in just proportion to that of Menelaus: for she had a daughter,\r\nHermione, before the abduction, and might, so far as age was concerned,\r\nhave borne children after their conjugal union was resumed[119].\r\nWhy, then, if Homer be the paramount authority, should we, upon\r\ntestimony inferior to his, introduce conflict and absurdity into two\r\ntraditions, which he gives us wide apart from one another and each\r\nself-consistent, by forging a connexion between them?\r\n\r\nI have stated these two cases, not by way of begging the question as to\r\nthe superiority in kind of Homer’s testimony, but to show how important\r\nthat question is; and in how many instances the history of the heroic\r\nage must be rewritten, if we adopt the principle, that Homer ought to\r\nbe received as an original witness, contemporary with the manners, nay,\r\nperhaps, even with some of the persons he describes, and subject only\r\nto such deductions as other original witnesses are liable to suffer:\r\nwhereas the later traditions rest only upon hearsay; so much so, that\r\nthey can hardly be called evidence, and should never be opposed, on\r\ntheir own credit, to the testimony of Homer.\r\n\r\nIn bringing this discussion to a close, I will quote a passage\r\nrespecting Homer, from the Earl of Aberdeen’s _Inquiry into the\r\nPrinciples of Beauty in Grecian Architecture_, which, I think,\r\nexpresses with great truth and simplicity the ground of Homer’s general\r\nclaim to authority, subject, of course, to any question respecting the\r\ngenuineness of the received text:\r\n\r\n  In treating of an age far removed from the approach of regular\r\n  history, it is fortunate that we are furnished with a guide so\r\n  unerring as Homer, whose general accuracy of observation, and\r\n  minuteness of description, are such as to afford a copious source of\r\n  information respecting almost everything connected with the times in\r\n  which he composed his work: and who, being nearly contemporary with\r\n  the events which he relates, and, indeed, with the earliest matter\r\n  for record in Greece, cannot fall into mistakes and anachronisms in\r\n  arts, or manners, or government, as he might have done had he lived\r\n  at a more advanced and refined period[120].\r\n\r\nIt was said of a certain Dorotheus, that he spent his whole life in\r\nendeavours to elucidate the meaning of the Homeric word κλισίη. Such a\r\ndisproportion between labour and its aim is somewhat startling; yet it\r\nis hardly too much to say, that no exertion spent upon any of the great\r\nclassics of the world, and attended with any amount of real result, is\r\nreally thrown away. It is better to write one word upon the rock, than\r\na thousand on the water or the sand: better to remove a single stray\r\nstone out of the path that mounts the hill of true culture, than to\r\nhew out miles of devious tracks, which mislead and bewilder us when we\r\ntravel them, and make us more than content if we are fortunate enough\r\nto find, when we emerge out of their windings, that we have simply\r\nreturned to the point in our age, from which, in sanguine youth, we set\r\nout.\r\n\r\nAs rules of the kind above propounded can only be fully understood when\r\napplied, the application of them has accordingly been attempted, in the\r\nwork to which these pages form an Introduction. In this view, it may be\r\nregarded as their necessary sequel. I commit it to the press with no\r\ninconsiderable apprehension, and with due deference to the judgments\r\nof the learned: for I do not feel myself to have possessed either\r\nthe fresh recollection and ready command of the treasures of ancient\r\nGreece, or the extended and systematic knowledge of the modern Homeric\r\nliterature, which are among the essential requisites of qualification\r\nto deal in a satisfactory manner with the subject. I should further\r\nsay, that the poems of Homer, to be rightly and thoroughly sounded,\r\ndemand undoubtedly a disengaged mind, perhaps would repay even the\r\nstudy of a life. One plea only I can advance with confidence. The work,\r\nwhatever else it be, is one which has been founded in good faith on\r\nthe text of Homer. Whether in statement or in speculation, I have\r\ndesired and endeavoured that it should lead me by the hand: and even my\r\nanticipations of what we might in any case expect it to contain have\r\nbeen formed by a reflex process from the suggestions it had itself\r\nsupplied:\r\n\r\n      Oh degli altri poeti onore e lume!\r\n    Vagliami il lungo studio, e il grande amore\r\n    Che m’ ha fatto cercar lo tuo volume;\r\n      Tu sei lo mio maestro, e il mio autore[121].\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFinally, though sharing the dissatisfaction of others at the\r\nestablished preference given among us to the Latin names of deities\r\noriginally Greek, and at some part of our orthography for Greek names,\r\nI have thought it best to adhere in general to the common custom, and\r\nonly to deviate from it where a special object was in view. I fear\r\nthat diversity, and even confusion, are more likely to arise than any\r\nbenefit, from efforts at reform, made by individuals, and without\r\nthe advantage either of authority or of a clear principle, as a\r\ngroundwork for general consent. I am here disposed to say, ‘οὐκ ἀγαθὸν\r\nπολυκοιρανίη;’ and again with Wordsworth,\r\n\r\n    ‘Me this unchartered freedom tires.’\r\n\r\nYet I should gladly see the day when, under the authority of Scholars,\r\nand especially of those who bear rule in places of education,\r\nimprovement might be effected, not only in the points above mentioned,\r\nbut in our solitary and barbarous method of pronouncing both the Greek\r\nand the Latin language. In this one respect the European world may\r\nstill with justice describe the English at least as the _penitus toto\r\ndivisos orbe Britannos_.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[93] Mure, ii. 282.\r\n\r\n[94] Mure, ii. 286.\r\n\r\n[95] Od. viii. 499.\r\n\r\n[96] Exc. i. ad Æn. ii.\r\n\r\n[97] Hist. of Greece, chap. i. sect. iv. p. 62. 4to.\r\n\r\n[98] Ibid. sect. iii. p. 47.\r\n\r\n[99] History of Greece, vol. i. p. 146; chap. vi.

I.\r\n\r\n_Scope of the Inquiry._\r\n\r\n\r\nI now proceed to attempt, in a series of inquiries, the practical\r\napplication of the principles which have been stated in the preliminary\r\nEssay. The first of these inquiries might on some grounds be deemed\r\nthe most hazardous. It is an inquiry into the Early Ethnology and\r\nEthnography of Greece: or the Composition of the Greek nation, and\r\nthe succession and Distribution of its races, according to the text\r\nof Homer. The religion, the politics, the manners, the contemporary\r\nhistory, of the Iliad and Odyssey, may justly be considered to form\r\nessential parts of the plan of the Poet, and to have been distinctly\r\ncontemplated by his intention. But into anterior legends he only dips\r\nat times: and of the subject of the succession and distribution of\r\nraces it probably formed no part of his purpose to treat at all; so\r\nthat in the endeavour to investigate it we are entirely dependent, so\r\nfar as he is concerned, upon scattered and incidental notices.\r\n\r\nBut here it is, that the extraordinary sureness and precision of the\r\nmind of Homer stands us in such admirable stead. Wherever, amidst the\r\ncloud and chaos of pre-Homeric antiquity, he enables us to discern a\r\nluminous point, that point is a beacon, and indicates ground on which\r\nwe may tread with confidence. The materials, which at a first glance\r\nappear upon the face of the poems to be available for our purpose,\r\nmay indeed be but slender. But the careful gathering together of many\r\ndispersed indications, and the strict observation of their relative\r\nbearings has this effect, that each fragment added to the stock may\r\nboth receive illustration from what is already known, and may give\r\nit in return, by helping to explain and establish relations hitherto\r\ndoubtful or obscure. And as the total or gross accumulation grows, the\r\nnett result increases in a more rapid ratio: as a single known point\r\nupon a plane tells us of nothing besides itself, but two enable us\r\nto draw a line, and three a triangle, and each further one as it is\r\nadded to construct a multitude of figures: or as in the map-puzzles,\r\nconstructed to provoke the ingenuity of children, when once a very few\r\ncountries have been laid in their right places, they serve as keys to\r\nthe rest, and we can lay out with confidence the general order. Even so\r\nI am not without hope that, as to some parts at least of this ethnical\r\nexamination, the Homeric indications may, when brought together,\r\nwarrant our applying to them words used by Cicero for another purpose:\r\n_est enim admirabilis continuatio seriesque rerum, ut aliæ ex aliis\r\nnexæ, et omnes inter se aptæ conligatæque videantur_[122].\r\n\r\nI must not, however, step over the threshold of the investigation\r\nwithout giving warning, that we have to meet at the outset an opinion\r\nbroadly pronounced, and proceeding from a person of such high authority\r\nas Mr. Grote, our most recent historian of Greece, to the effect that\r\nthese inquiries are futile. This intimation is so important that it\r\nshall stand in his own words. “In going through historical Greece,”\r\nsays Mr. Grote, “we are compelled to accept the Hellenic aggregate\r\nwith its constituent elements as a primary fact to start from,\r\nbecause the state of our information does not enable us to ascend any\r\nhigher. By what circumstances, or out of what pre-existing elements,\r\nthis aggregate was brought together and modified, we find no evidence\r\nentitled to credit[123].” And then, in condemnation particularly of\r\nPelasgic inquiries, he resumes: “if any man is inclined to call the\r\nunknown ante-Hellenic period of Greece by the name of Pelasgic, it is\r\nopen to him to do so: but this is a name carrying with it no assured\r\npredicates, no way enlarging our insight into real history, nor\r\nenabling us to explain--what would be the real historical problem--how\r\nor from whom the Hellens acquired that stock of dispositions,\r\naptitudes, arts, &c. with which they began their career.... No\r\nattested facts are now present to us--none were present to Herodotus\r\nand Thucydides even in their age, on which to build trustworthy\r\naffirmations respecting the ante-Hellenic Pelasgians.”\r\n\r\nIn answer to these passages, which raise the question no less broadly\r\nthan fairly, it may first be observed, that at least Herodotus and\r\nThucydides did not think what we are thus invited to think for them,\r\nand that of the judgment of the latter, as an inquirer into matters of\r\nfact, Mr. Grote has himself justly expressed the highest opinion[124].\r\nMr. Grote, placing in one category all that relates to the legendary\r\nage, finds it as a whole intractable and unhistorical, with a\r\npredominance of sentimental attributes quite unlike the practical\r\nturn and powers of the Greek mind in later times[125]. But has not\r\nthis disturbance of equilibrium happened chiefly because the genuine\r\nthough slender historic materials of the heroic age, supplied by the\r\npoems of Homer, have been overborne and flooded by the accumulations\r\nmade by imagination, vanity, resentment, or patriotism, during a\r\nthousand years? Even of the unsifted mass of legend, to which the\r\ndistinguished historian refers, it may be doubted, whether it is not,\r\nwhen viewed as a whole, bewildering, formless, and inconsistent, rather\r\nthan sentimental. It has been everywhere darkened by cross purposes,\r\nand by the unauthorized meddling of generations, which had ceased to\r\nsympathize with the heroic age. At any rate, I crave permission to try\r\nwhat we can make of that age in the matter of history, by dealing first\r\nand foremost with him who handled it for the purposes of history, apart\r\nfrom those, I mean the after poets, tragedians, and logographers, to\r\nwhom it was little more than a romance.\r\n\r\nI trust that the recent examples of men so learned and able as Bishop\r\nThirlwall and K. O. Müller, neither of whom have thought subjects\r\nof this kind too uninviting to reward inquiry, may avail both to\r\nprevent the interposition of a preliminary bar to the discussion, and\r\nto protect it against an adverse prejudgment. By anticipation I can\r\nreasonably make no other answer to a condemnatory sentence, than that\r\nwhich is conveyed in the words ‘let us try.’ But at any rate, _est\r\noperæ pretium_: the stake is worth the venture. He would be indeed a\r\nworthless biographer who did not, so far as his materials carried him,\r\npursue the life of a hero back to the nursery or even the cradle: and\r\nthe same faithful and well-grounded instincts invest with a surpassing\r\ninterest all real elucidation of the facts and ideas, that make up the\r\nimage of the Greek nation either in its infancy or even in its embryo.\r\n\r\nThere are three and only three names of ordinary use in the Iliad,\r\nby which the poet designates the people that had been banded together\r\nagainst Troy. This same people afterwards became famous in history,\r\nperhaps beyond all others, first by the name of Hellenes, which was\r\nself-applied; and secondly by the name of Greeks, which they acquired\r\nfrom their Italian conquerors and captives. Greece is now again become\r\nHellas.\r\n\r\nThese names, prominent far beyond all others, are,\r\n\r\n1. Δαναοὶ, Danaans.\r\n\r\n2. Ἀργεῖοι, Argeians or Argives.\r\n\r\n3. Ἀχαιοὶ, Achæans.\r\n\r\nThey are commonly treated as synonymous. It appears at least to have\r\nbeen assumed that they are incapable of yielding any practical results\r\nto an attempt at historic analysis and distribution. To try this\r\nquestion fully, is a main part of my present purpose. Thus much at\r\nleast is clear: that they seem to be the equivalents, for the Troic\r\nperiod, of the Hellenic name in later times.\r\n\r\nBut there are other names, of various classes, which on account of\r\ntheir relations to the foregoing ones it is material to bring into view.\r\n\r\nFirst, there are found in Homer two other designations, which purport\r\nto have the same effect as the three already quoted. They are\r\n\r\n1. Παναχαιοὶ, Panachæans.\r\n\r\n2. Πανέλληνες, Panhellenes.\r\n\r\nNext come three names of races, whose relations to the foregoing\r\nappellations will demand scrutiny. These are\r\n\r\n1. Πελασγοὶ, Pelasgians.\r\n\r\n2. Ἕλληνες, Hellenes.\r\n\r\n3. Θρῇκες, Thracians, or rather Thraces.\r\n\r\nLastly, there are a more numerous class of names, which are local in\r\nthis sense, that Homer only mentions them in connection with particular\r\nparts of Greece, but which being clearly tribal and not territorial,\r\nstand clearly distinguished from the names which owed, or may have\r\nowed, their origin to the different cities or districts of the country,\r\nsuch as Phocian (Il. ii. 517), Rhodian (654), Elian (Il. xi. 670), or\r\nIthacan (Odyssey _passim_): and likewise from the names which already\r\nwere, or afterwards came to be, in established connection with those\r\nof districts, though they have no appearance of having been originally\r\nterritorial: such as Arcadian (Il. ii. 603, 611), Bœotian (Il. ii.\r\n494), Athenian (Il. ii. 546, 551).\r\n\r\nOf the class now before us there are some which are of importance in\r\nvarious degrees with regard to the views of primitive history to be\r\ngathered from the Homeric poems. As such I rank\r\n\r\n1. Καδμεῖοι, Cadmeans, in Thebes, Il. iv. 388 and elsewhere: and with\r\nthis, as an equivalent, Καδμείωνες, Il. iv. 385 and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n2. Ἰάονες, Ionians, in Athens, Il. xiii. 685.\r\n\r\n3. Δωριέες, Dorians, in Crete, Od. xix. 177. A town Dorion is also\r\nmentioned in the Catalogue as within the territories of Nestor, Il. ii.\r\n594.\r\n\r\n4. Κεφάλληνες, Cephallenes, in the islands under Ulysses, Il. ii. 631.\r\n\r\n5. Ἐφυροὶ, Ephyri, in Thessaly, Il. xiii. 301.\r\n\r\n6. Σελλοὶ or Ἑλλοὶ, Helli, in northern Thessaly, Il. xvi. 234.\r\n\r\n7. Καύκωνες, Caucones, in southern Greece, Od. iii. 366: (and among the\r\nTrojan allies, Il. x. 429, xx. 329.)\r\n\r\n8. Ἐπεῖοι, Epeans, in Elis, Il. ii. 619, and on the opposite or\r\nnorthern coast and islands of the Corinthian Gulf: compare Il. ii. 627,\r\nand xiii. 691.\r\n\r\n9. Ἄβαντες, Abantes, in Eubœa, Il. ii. 536.\r\n\r\n10. Μυρμίδονες, Myrmidones, in Phthia, Il. ii. 684.\r\n\r\n11. Κουρῆτες, Curetes, in Ætolia, Il. ix. 529.\r\n\r\n12. Φλεγύαι, Phlegyæ, in Thessaly, Il. xiii. 301.\r\n\r\n13. Φῆρες, in Thessaly, Il. i. 267, 8, ii. 733, 4.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly it may be mentioned that in the single word Γραῖα, used (Il.\r\nii. 498) to designate one of the numerous Bœotian towns, we have an\r\nisolated indication of the existence in the heroic times of the germ of\r\nthe names _Greece_ and _Greek_, which afterwards ascended to, and still\r\nretain, such extraordinary fame.\r\n\r\nThe Homeric text will afford us means of investigation, more or less,\r\nfor the greater part of these names, but the main thread of the inquiry\r\nruns with these five; Pelasgians, Hellenes, Danaans, Argeians, Achæans.\r\n\r\nIn conjunction with the present subject, I shall consider what light\r\nis thrown by Homer on the relations of the Greeks with other races not\r\nproperly Greek: the Lycians, the Phœnicians, the Sicels, the Egyptians,\r\nthe people of Cyprus, and finally the Persians. The name of the Leleges\r\nwill be considered in conjunction with that of the Caucones.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[122] Cic. de Nat.

Are the Pelasgians essentially Greek?\r\n\r\n2. If so, what is their relation to the Hellenes, and to the integral\r\nGreek nation?\r\n\r\n3. What elements did they contribute to the formation of the composite\r\nbody thus called?\r\n\r\n4. What was their language?\r\n\r\n5. What was the derivation of their name?\r\n\r\n6. By what route did they come into Greece?\r\n\r\nThe direct evidence of the Homeric poems with respect to the Pelasgians\r\nis scattered and faint. It derives however material aid from various\r\nbranches of tradition, partly conveyed in the Homeric poems, and partly\r\nextraneous to them, particularly religion, language, and pursuits.\r\nEvidence legitimately drawn from these latter sources, wherever it is\r\nin the nature of circumstantial proof, is far superior in authority to\r\nsuch literary traditions as are surrounded, at their visible source,\r\nwith circumstances of uncertainty.\r\n\r\n_The Pelasgians._\r\n\r\nI. The first passage, with which we have to deal, is that portion of\r\nthe Catalogue of the Greek armament, where Homer introduces us to the\r\ncontingent of Achilles in the following lines:\r\n\r\n    Νῦν αὖ τοὺς ὅσσοι τὸ Πελασγικὸν Ἄργος ἔναιον,\r\n    Οἵ τ’ Ἄλον οἵ τ’ Ἀλόπην οἵ τε Τρηχῖν’ ἐνέμοντο,\r\n    Οἵ τ’ εἶχον Φθίην ἠδ’ Ἑλλάδα καλλιγύναικα,\r\n    Μυρμιδόνες δὲ καλεῦντο καὶ Ἕλληνες καὶ Ἀχαιοὶ,\r\n    Τῶν αὖ πεντήκοντα νεῶν ἦν ἀρχὸς Ἀχιλλεύς[126].\r\n\r\nAll evidence goes to show, that Thessaly stood in a most important\r\nrelation to the infant life of the Greek races; whether we consider it\r\nas the seat of many most ancient legends; as dignified by the presence\r\nof Dodona, the highest seat of religious tradition and authority to\r\nthe Greeks; as connected with the two ancient names of Helli and\r\nPelasgi: or lastly in regard to the prominence it retained even down\r\nto and during the historic age in the constitution of the Amphictyonic\r\nCouncil[127]. All these indications are in harmony with the course of\r\nGreek ethnological tradition.\r\n\r\nNow the Catalogue of the Greek armament is divided into three great\r\nsections.\r\n\r\nThe first comprises Continental Greece, with the islands immediately\r\nadjacent to the coast, and lying south of Thessaly. The second consists\r\nof the Greek islands of the Ægean. The third is wholly Thessalian: and\r\nit begins with the lines which have been quoted.\r\n\r\n_The Pelasgians: Pelasgic Argos._\r\n\r\nWhat then does Homer mean us to understand by the phrase τὸ Πελασγικὸν\r\nἌργος in this passage? Is it\r\n\r\n1. A mere town, or town and district, like Alos, Alope, and others\r\nwhich follow; or is it\r\n\r\n2. A country comprising several or many such?\r\n\r\nAnd if the latter, does it describe\r\n\r\n1. That country only over which Peleus reigned, and which supplied the\r\nMyrmidon division; or\r\n\r\n2. A more extended country?\r\n\r\nFirst let us remark the use of the article. It is not the manner of\r\nHomer to employ the article with the proper names of places. We may\r\nbe sure that it carries with it a distinctive force: as in the Trojan\r\nCatalogue he employs it to indicate a particular race or body of\r\nPelasgians[128] apart from others. Now the distinctive force of the\r\narticle here may have either or both of two bearings.\r\n\r\n1. It may mark off the Argos of the Pelasgians from one or more other\r\ncountries or places bearing the name of Argos.\r\n\r\n2. Even independently of the epithet, the article may be rightly\r\nemployed, if Argos itself be not strictly a proper name, but rather a\r\ndescriptive word indicating the physical character of a given region.\r\nThus ‘Scotland’ is strictly a proper name, ‘Lowlands’ a descriptive\r\nword of this nature: and the latter takes the article where the former\r\ndoes not require or even admit it. And now let us proceed to make our\r\nselection between the various alternatives before us.\r\n\r\nWhichever of the two bearings we give to the article, it seems\r\nof itself to preclude the supposition that a mere town or single\r\nsettlement can be here intended: for nowhere does Homer give the\r\narticle to a name of that class.\r\n\r\nSecondly, in almost every place where Homer speaks of an Argos, he\r\nmakes it plain that he does not mean a mere town or single settlement,\r\nbut a country including towns or settlements within it. The exceptions\r\nto this rule are rare. In Il. iv. 52 we have one of them, where he\r\ncombines Argos with Sparta and Mycenæ, and calls all three by the name\r\nof cities. The line Il. ii. 559 probably supplies another. But in a\r\nlater Section[129] the general rule will be fully illustrated.\r\n\r\nIt will also clearly appear, that the name Argos is in fact a\r\ndescriptive word, not a proper name, and is nearly equivalent to our\r\n‘Lowlands’ or to the Italian ‘campagna.’\r\n\r\nThirdly: in many other places of the Catalogue, Homer begins by placing\r\nin the front, as it were, the comprehensive name which overrides and\r\nincludes the particular names that are to follow; and then, without any\r\nother distinctive mark than the use of the faint enclitic copulative\r\nτε, proceeds to enumerate parts included within the whole which he has\r\npreviously named. Thus for instance\r\n\r\n        οἱ δ’ Εὔβοιαν ἔχον ...\r\n    Χαλκίδα τ’ Εἰρετρίαν τε κ.τ.λ.\r\n\r\n    v. 535, 6.\r\n\r\n‘Those who held Eubœa, both Chalcis and Eretria’.... Or in the English\r\nidiom we may perhaps write more correctly, ‘Those who held Eubœa, that\r\nis to say Chalcis, and Eretria’ ... and the rest.\r\n\r\nAgain,\r\n\r\n    οἱ δ’ εἶχον κοιλὴν Λακεδαίμονα κητώεσσαν\r\n    Φᾶρίν τε Σπάρτην τε ...\r\n\r\n    v. 581, 2.\r\n\r\n‘Those who held channelled Laconia, abounding in wild beasts, namely,\r\nthe several settlements of Pharis and Sparta,’ and the rest.\r\n\r\nSo with Arcadia, v. 603, and Ithaca, v. 631.\r\n\r\nWe may therefore consider the verse 681,\r\n\r\n    Νῦν αὖ τοὺς, ὅσσοι τὸ Πελασγικὸν Ἄργος ἔναιον·\r\n\r\nas prefatory, and I print it, accordingly, so as to mark a pause.\r\n\r\nBut, again, is it prefatory only to the division of Achilles, and\r\nis it simply the integer expressing the whole territory from which\r\nhis contingent was drawn, or is it prefatory to the whole remainder\r\nof the Catalogue, ending at v. 759, and does it include all the nine\r\nterritorial divisions described therein? There is no grammatical or\r\nother reason for the former alternative, while various considerations\r\nrecommend the latter.\r\n\r\nThere is no sign in the poems of any connection between Achilles with\r\nhis Myrmidons, or between the kingdom of his father Peleus, and any\r\nparticular part of Thessaly under the name of Argos, or Pelasgic Argos.\r\nAlthough the division of Achilles did not embrace the whole of the\r\nPhthians[130], yet Phthia appears to be the proper description of his\r\nterritory, so far as it has a collective name: and there are signs,\r\nwhich will be hereafter considered, that the name of Phthia itself was\r\nembraced and included within the wider range of another name.\r\n\r\nAgain, the Pelasgic name, as will be further observed, is not in Homer\r\nspecially connected with the South of Thessaly, where the realm of\r\nPeleus lay, but rather with the North, the towns and settlements of\r\nwhich are enumerated, not in the first, but in the later paragraphs of\r\nthis portion of the Catalogue.\r\n\r\nIn the invocation of the Sixteenth Book, to which reference will\r\nshortly be made, Achilles at once addresses Jupiter as Pelasgic, and as\r\ndwelling afar (τηλόθι ναίων): therefore, the special Thessalian seat of\r\nthe god could not be in the dominions of Peleus.\r\n\r\nWe have observed, again, in the earlier parts of the catalogue various\r\ncollective names, afterwards explained distributively, for the various\r\ncontingents: but there is not one of this class of names employed\r\nfor any of the Eight Divisions which follow that of Achilles. They\r\nall seem to bear the form of particular distributive enumerations,\r\nbelonging to the comprehensive head of Pelasgic Argos or Thessaly.\r\n\r\nThere is also something in the obvious break in the Catalogue,\r\nsignified by the words\r\n\r\n    νῦν αὖ τοὺς ὅσσοι ...\r\n\r\nwhich indicate, as it were, a completely new starting point. There\r\nis nothing else resembling them. They form the introduction to a new\r\nchapter of the lists, after a geographical transition from the islands:\r\nand there is no reason for these marked words, if Pelasgic Argos was\r\neither a mere town district, or a local sovereignty, but a very good\r\nreason, if Pelasgic Argos meant that great integral portion of the\r\nGreek territory, the vale of Thessaly, the particular parts of which\r\nthe Poet was about to set forth in so much detail.\r\n\r\nIt may therefore be inferred, that the epithet Πελασγικὸν is applied\r\nby Homer to the Thessalian vale collectively, as it is contained\r\nbetween the mountains of Pindus to the west, Œta and Olympus to the\r\nnorth, Othrys to the south, and Ossa or the sea to the east. We might,\r\nwithout geographical error, translate the phrase τὸ Πελασγικὸν Ἄργος\r\nof the second Iliad by that name of Thessaly[131], which the country\r\nafterwards acquired: but the idea which it properly indicates to us,\r\nis, _that Argos which had been settled by the Pelasgians_.\r\n\r\nIt is the only geographical epithet which, applied to the name Argos,\r\nbelongs to the north of Greece: and it is so applied by way of\r\ndistinction and opposition to other uses of the name Argos in other\r\nparts of the poems, which we shall hereafter have to examine, namely,\r\nthe Achaic and the Iasian Argos.\r\n\r\n_The Pelasgians: Dodona._\r\n\r\nII. Perhaps the most solemn invocation of Jupiter as the great deity of\r\nthe Greeks in the whole of the Poems is where Achilles, sending forth\r\nPatroclus to battle, prays that glory may be given him. It runs thus\r\n(Il. xvi. 233-5):\r\n\r\n    Ζεῦ ἄνα, Δωδωναῖε, Πελασγικὲ, τηλόθι ναίων,\r\n    Δωδώνης μεδέων δυσχειμέρου· ἀμφὶ δέ σ’ Ἕλλοι\r\n    σοὶ ναίουσ’ ὑποφῆται ἀνιπτόποδες χαμαιεῦναι.\r\n\r\nIt seems not too much to say upon this remarkable passage, that it\r\nshows us, as it were, the nation pitching its first altar upon its\r\nfirst arrival in the country. It bears witness that those who brought\r\nthe worship of Dodonæan Jupiter were Pelasgians, as well as that the\r\nspot, which they chose for the principal seat of their worship, was\r\nDodona. For the appeal of Achilles on this occasion is evidently the\r\nmost forcible that he has it in his power to make, and is addressed to\r\nthe highest source of Divine power that he knew.\r\n\r\nIt has been debated, but apparently without any conclusive result, what\r\nwas the site of the Dodona so famous in the after-times of Greece[132].\r\nIt seems clear, however, that it was a Dodona to the westward of\r\nPindus, and belonging to Thesprotia or Molossia. But this plainly was\r\nnot the position of the Dodona we have now before us. For in a passage\r\nof the Catalogue Homer distinctly places this Dodona in Thessaly,\r\ngiving it the same epithet, δυσχείμερος, as Achilles applies to it in\r\nIl. xvi. Gouneus, he says, was followed by the Enienes and Perrhæbi,\r\n\r\n    οἱ περὶ Δωδώνην δυσχείμερον οἴκι’ ἔθεντο,\r\n    οἵ τ’ ἀμφ’ ἱμερτὸν Τιταρήσιον ἔργ’ ἐνέμοντο[133].\r\n\r\nBoth the name of the Perrhæbi and that of the river Titaresius fix the\r\nDodona of Homer in the north of Thessaly. And the character assigned\r\nto this Titaresius, so near Dodona, as a branch of Styx, ‘the mighty\r\nadjuration of the gods,’ well illustrates the close connection between\r\nthat river, by which the other deities were to swear, and Jupiter,\r\nwho was their chief, and was in a certain sense the administrator of\r\njustice among them. In the Odyssey, indeed, Ulysses, in his fictitious\r\nnarrations to Eumæus and Penelope, represents himself as having\r\ntravelled from Thesprotia to consult the oracle of Jupiter, that was\r\ndelivered from a lofty oak[134]. But no presumption of nearness can be\r\nfounded on this passage such as to justify our assuming the existence\r\nof a separate Dodona westward of the mountains in the Homeric age:\r\nand there was no reason why Ulysses should not represent himself as\r\ntravelling through the passes of Mount Pindus[135] from the Ambracian\r\ngulf into Thessaly to learn his fate. Nor upon the other hand is there\r\nany vast difficulty in adopting the supposition which the evidence in\r\nthe case suggests, that the oracle of Dodonæan Jupiter may have changed\r\nits seat before the historic age. The evidence of Homer places it in\r\nThessaly, and Homer is, as we shall see, corroborated by Hesiod. After\r\nthem, we hear nothing of a Dodona having its seat in Thessaly, but\r\nmuch of one on the western side of the peninsula. As in later times we\r\nfind Perrhæbi and Dolopes to the westward of Pindus, whom Homer shows\r\nus only on the east, even so in the course of time the oracle may have\r\ntravelled in the same direction[136]. It is highly improbable, from\r\nthe manner in which the name is used, that there should have been two\r\nGreek Dodonas in the Homeric age.\r\n\r\nHowever, the very passage before us indicates, that revolution\r\nhad already laid its hand on this ancient seat of Greek religion.\r\nFor though the Dodona of Homer was Pelasgic by its origin, its\r\nneighbourhood was now inhabited by a different race, the Selli or\r\nHelli, and these Helli were also the ὑποφῆται or ministers of the\r\ndeity. While their rude and filthy habits of life mark them as probably\r\na people of recent arrival, who had not themselves yet emerged from\r\ntheir highland home, and from the struggle with want and difficulty,\r\ninto civilized life, still they had begun to encroach upon the\r\nPelasgians with their inviting possessions and more settled habits, and\r\nhad acquired by force or otherwise the control of the temple, though\r\nwithout obliterating the tradition of its Pelasgic origin. The very\r\nfact, that the Helli were at the time the ministers of Jupiter, tends\r\nto confirm the belief that the Pelasgians were those who originally\r\nestablished it; for how otherwise could the name of the Pelasgian race\r\nhave found its way into an Hellenic invocation?\r\n\r\nThus, as before we found that what we term Thessaly is to Homer ‘the\r\nArgos of the Pelasgians,’ so we now find that people associated with\r\nthe original and central worship of the Greek Jupiter, as having\r\nprobably been the race to whom it owed its establishment.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, though the Pelasgians were not politically predominant in\r\nThessaly at the epoch of the _Troica_, yet Thessaly is Pelasgian Argos:\r\nthough they were not possessed of the Dodonæan oracle, yet Jupiter of\r\nDodona is Pelasgian Jupiter: two branches of testimony, the first of\r\nwhich exhibits them as the earliest known colonisers of the country,\r\nand the second as the reputed founders of the prime article of its\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nWe must not quit this subject without referring to the evidence of\r\nHesiod, which, though second in importance to that of Homer, is before\r\nany other literary testimony. He refers twice to Dodona. Neither time\r\ndoes he appear to carry it to the westward. In one passage he connects\r\nit immediately with the Pelasgians;\r\n\r\n    Δωδώνην, φῆγόν τε, Πελασγῶν ἕδρανον, ἧκεν[137].\r\n\r\nIn the other passage, he associates it with the Hellic name through the\r\nmedium of the territorial designation Hellopia:\r\n\r\n    ἐστί τις Ἑλλοπίη πολυλήϊος ἠδ’ εὐλείμων,\r\n    ἔνθα τε Δωδώνη τις ἐπ’ ἐσχατίῃ πεπόλισται[138].\r\n\r\nThus, in exact accordance with Homer, he associates Dodona with two\r\nand only two names of race, the same two as those with which it is\r\nassociated in the invocation of Achilles.\r\n\r\n_Thessaly and the Southern Islands._\r\n\r\nIII. Next, we find in Homer a widely spread connection between Thessaly\r\nand the islands which form as it were the base of the Ægean sea.\r\n\r\nFrom these islands he enumerates four contingents furnished to the\r\nGreek army:\r\n\r\n1. From Crete, under Idomeneus (Il. ii. 645).\r\n\r\n2. From Rhodes, under Tlepolemus (653).\r\n\r\n3. From Syme, under Nireus (671).\r\n\r\n4. From Nisyrus, the Calydnæ, and other minor islands, under Pheidippus\r\nand Antiphus (676).\r\n\r\n1. As to Crete. Universal tradition connects the name of Deucalion with\r\nThessaly. But he was the son, according to Homer, of Minos, who was the\r\nruler or warden of Crete (Κρήτῃ ἐπίουρος, Il. xiii. 450): and he was\r\nalso the father of Idomeneus, leader of the Cretans before Troy (Il.\r\nxiii. 452), and ruler over many of them (ibid.), but not, so far as\r\nappears, over the whole island.\r\n\r\nNow Minos was not only king of all Crete, but son of Jupiter (ibid.,\r\nand Od. xi. 568) by a Phœnician damsel of great note (Il. xiv. 321); we\r\nmust therefore regard him, or his mother, as having come from Phœnicia\r\ninto Crete. The inference would be, that Deucalion came from Crete to\r\nThessaly, and that he, or Idomeneus his son, re-migrated to Crete.\r\nHomer does not indeed state that Deucalion was ever in Thessaly: but\r\nhe indirectly supports the tradition both by placing Idomeneus in a\r\ndifferent position in Crete from that of his grandfather Minos, and\r\notherwise[139]. This supposition would at once reconcile the later\r\ntradition with Homer, and explain to us why the grandson of Minos only\r\nfilled an inferior position.\r\n\r\nAgain, as we see that Thessaly is Pelasgic, and that the Thessalian\r\nMyrmidons are called Achæans, so likewise we find among the five\r\nnations of Crete both Pelasgians and Achæans[140]. Here, according to\r\nStrabo, Staphylus described these two races as inhabiting the plains,\r\nand Andron reported them, as also the Dorians, to have come from\r\nThessaly: erroneously, says Strabo (x. 4., p. 476), making the mother\r\ncity of the Dorians a mere colony from the Thessalians. And the ancient\r\ntradition which places the infant Jupiter in Crete (‘Jovis incunabula\r\nCreten’), concurs with the idea which the above-named facts would\r\nsuggest, that the Pelasgians may have come, at least in part, from the\r\nsouthern islands of the Ægean.\r\n\r\n2. As to Rhodes. Tlepolemus, its chieftain, is the son of Hercules, and\r\nof Astyochea, whom, in the course of his raids, he took from Ephyra by\r\nthe river Selleeis. It is questioned which Ephyra, and which Selleeis,\r\nfor of both there were several, these may have been. If they were in\r\nThessaly[141], we have thus a line of connection established between\r\nThessaly and Rhodes.\r\n\r\n3. As to the contingent from Nisyrus, the Calydnæ, and Cos. Firstly, it\r\nwas commanded by Pheidippus and Antiphus (678), sons of Thessalus, the\r\nson of Hercules. The connection between Hercules and Thessaly, which\r\nis agreeable to the general course of tradition, also harmonises with\r\nthe most natural construction which can be put upon this passage of\r\nHomer: namely, that this Thessalus was the person who afterwards became\r\nthe eponymist of Thessaly, that he was a native or inhabitant of the\r\ncountry, and that either he, or more probably his sons, were emigrants\r\nfrom it to the islands.\r\n\r\nHis name, latent for a time, may afterwards have attained to its\r\nelevation, as a means of connecting Thessaly with Hercules, when the\r\ndescendants of that hero had become predominant in the South. Perhaps\r\nthe appearance of the post-Homeric name ‘Doris’ may be explained in the\r\nsame manner.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Cos is described as the city of Eurypylus. This may mean a\r\ncity which he had founded; or a city which was then actually under his\r\ndominion. Beyond all doubt, it indicates a very special connection\r\nof some kind between Cos and Eurypylus. Now, his name is mentioned\r\nwithout adjunct. Had he been a deceased founder of the city, he would\r\nprobably have been called θεῖος like Thoas (Il. xiv. 230). If he was\r\nliving, who was he? We have in the Iliad one very famous Eurypylus,\r\nwho appears among the nine foremost of the Greek heroes (Il. vii.\r\n167), and whose rank entitled him (xi. 818) to be called Διοτρεφής; an\r\nepithet confined, as is probable, to Kings[142]. Now although Homer\r\nallows himself, when he is dealing with secondary persons, to apply\r\nthe same name to more than one individual, without always caring to\r\ndiscriminate between them, there is no instance in which he does this\r\nfor a person of the class of Eurypylus. This probably, therefore, is\r\nthe same Eurypylus, as meets us in other parts of the poem, the son of\r\nEuæmon. But from the Catalogue[143], it appears that he commanded the\r\ncontingent from Ormenium in Thessaly. If then, the same person, who\r\nfounded or had some special relation to Cos, was also the commander\r\nof a Thessalian force, here we have a new track of connection between\r\nThessaly and the islands to the southward.\r\n\r\n4. Nireus, named by Homer for his beauty alone, with his three ships\r\nfrom Syme, can scarcely be said to make an unit in the Greek catalogue.\r\n\r\nWith this one inconsiderable exception, we find in all the cases of\r\nisland contingents a connection subsisting between them and Thessaly,\r\nand this connection not appearing to be mediate, along the line of\r\nmainland which reaches from Thessaly to within a short distance from\r\nCrete, but apparently maintained directly by the maritime route: a fact\r\nof importance in considering the probable extension and movement of the\r\nPelasgic race, which we find existing in both regions. We know from\r\nHomer[144] that the southern islands were a common route connecting\r\nGreece with the East. There are also abundant traces of migration by\r\nthe northern coast of the Ægean. Thus it is at both those gates of\r\nGreece, that we find the Pelasgian name subsisting in the time of\r\nHomer, when in the nearer vicinity of the centre of Achæan power it was\r\nalready extinct.\r\n\r\n_The Pelasgians._\r\n\r\nIV. Again, I think we may trace the near connection between the\r\nPelasgians and the Greek nation in the laudatory epithets with which\r\nthe former are mentioned by Homer. We must here keep in mind on the one\r\nhand the extraordinary skill and care with which the Poet employed his\r\nepithets, and on the other hand, his never failing solicitude to exalt\r\nand adorn every thing Greek.\r\n\r\nHomer names the Pelasgians only thrice, and each time with a laudatory\r\nepithet.\r\n\r\nIn Il. x. 429, where they form part of the Trojan camp, and again in\r\nOd. xix. 177, where they are stated to be found in Crete, they are\r\nδῖοι. Homer never applies this word except to what is preeminent in its\r\nkind: in particular, he never attaches it to any national name besides\r\nthe Pelasgi, except Ἀχαιοὶ, which of itself amounts to a presumption\r\nthat he regarded his countrymen as in some way standing in the same\r\nclass with the Pelasgians.\r\n\r\nIn the remaining passage where he names the Pelasgians, that in the\r\nTrojan Catalogue (Il. ii. 340), he calls them ἐγχεσίμωροι. He uses this\r\nepithet in only three other places. Of itself it is laudatory, because\r\nit is connected with the proper work of heroes, the σταδίη ὑσμίνη.\r\nIn one of the three places he applies it individually to two royal\r\nwarriors, one Munes the husband of Briseis, and the other Epistrophus\r\n(Il. ii. 693), a warrior associated with Munes. In the second (Il. vii.\r\n134), he gives it to the Arcadians; whom in the Catalogue (ii. 611), he\r\nhas already commended as ἐπιστάμενοι πολεμίζειν. In the third passage\r\n(Od. iii. 188), he applies the epithet to the Myrmidons themselves.\r\nFrom each of these uses, the last especially, we may draw fresh\r\npresumptions of his high estimate of the Pelasgian name.\r\n\r\nV. Again. In the case of a race, unless when it can be traced to\r\nan Eponymus or name-giver, the plural name precedes the singular\r\nin common use. There must be Celts before there can be a Celt, and\r\nPelasgians before there can be a Pelasgian. The use therefore of the\r\nsingular, in the names of nations, is a proof of what is established\r\nand long familiar.\r\n\r\nFor example, Homer never calls a single Greek Δαναός, nor Ἀργεῖος\r\n(though in the particular cases of Juno and of Helen he uses the\r\nsingular feminine, of which more hereafter), but only Ἀχαιός; and we\r\nshall find, that this fact is not without its meaning. It is therefore\r\nworthy of note, that he uses the term Πελασγὸς in the singular. The\r\nchiefs of the Pelasgian ἐπίκουροι at Troy were Hippothous and Pulæus,\r\n(Il. ii. 843,) who were\r\n\r\n    υἷε δύω Λήθοιο Πελασγοῦ Τευταμίδαο.\r\n\r\nAnd again, (xvii. 288),\r\n\r\n    Λήθοιο Πελασγοῦ φαίδιμος υἷος.\r\n\r\n‘The illustrious son of Lethus the Pelasgian.’ It seems uncertain, from\r\ntheir place in the Trojan Catalogue, whether these Pelasgians were\r\nEuropean or Asiatic; nor is it material to which region they belonged.\r\n\r\n_The Pelasgians and Larissa._\r\n\r\nVI. It is further observable, that Homer implies distinctly the\r\nexistence of various tribes of Pelasgi under that same name in various\r\nand widely separated places. He says,\r\n\r\n    Ἱππόθοος δ’ ἄγε φῦλα Πελασγῶν ἐγχεσιμώρων\r\n    τῶν, οἱ Λαρίσσην ἐριβώλακα ναιετάουσιν.\r\n\r\nStrabo justly observes upon the use of the plural φῦλα in this passage\r\nas implying considerable numbers. And the words τῶν οἱ in the\r\nfollowing line, signifying “namely those Pelasgi, who,” show that the\r\npoet found it necessary to use a distinctive mark in order that these\r\nPelasgi might not be confounded with other Pelasgi. Again, as this is\r\nin the Trojan Catalogue, where as a matter of course no Greeks would\r\nbe found, he could hardly need to distinguish them from any Pelasgi\r\nconnected with the Greeks, and we may assume it as most probable that\r\nhe meant thus to distinguish them from other Pelasgi out of Greece\r\nrather than in Greece. At the same time, he may have had regard to\r\nother Pelasgians of Pelasgic Argos. In that country, as we may conclude\r\nwith confidence from the appellation itself, they were known to form\r\nthe bulk of the population, and as we hear of no such Pelasgian mass\r\nelsewhere in Homer, he may possibly have had them particularly in his\r\nmind, when he described the Trojan Pelasgians as Pelasgians of Larissa.\r\n\r\nSome light is also thrown upon the character and habits of nations\r\nby the epithets attached to their places of abode. Homer mentions\r\nLarissa but twice: once here, and once where he relates the death of\r\nHippothous, τῆλ’ ἀπὸ Λαρίσσης ἐριβώλακος (Il. xvii. 301). The fertility\r\nof Larissa tends, as far as it goes, to mark the Pelasgi as a people of\r\ncultivators, having settled habits of life.\r\n\r\nThere is some difficulty, however, connected with the particular sign\r\nwhich Homer has employed to distinguish these Pelasgians. ‘Hippothous\r\nled the Pelasgi, those Pelasgi, I mean, who inhabit productive\r\nLarissa.’ From this it would appear that in the days of Homer, though\r\nthere were many Pelasgi in various places, there was but one Larissa.\r\nAnd, accordingly, the name never appears within the Greece of Homer,\r\neither in the Catalogue, or elsewhere. Yet tradition hands down to us\r\nmany Larissas, both in Greece and beyond it: and critics hold it to be\r\nreasonably presumed, wherever we find a Larissa, that there Pelasgi had\r\nbeen settled. But this name of Larissa apparently was not, and probably\r\ncould not have been, thus largely employed in Homer’s time; for if it\r\nhad been so, the poet’s use of the term Larissa would not have been\r\nin this case what he meant it to be, namely, distinctive. Yet the\r\nPelasgians were even at that time apparently falling, or even fallen,\r\ninto decay. How then could they have built many new cities in the\r\nsubsequent ages? And, except in that way, how could the name Larissa\r\nhave revived, and acquired its peculiar significance?\r\n\r\nIn six places of the Iliad we hear of a particular part of the city of\r\nTroy which was built upon a height, and in which the temple of Apollo\r\nwas situated (v. 446). This affords us an example of a separate name,\r\nΠέργαμος, affixed to a separate part of a city, that part apparently\r\nbeing the citadel. In like manner the citadel of Argos (which stood\r\nupon an eminence) had, at a later date, a distinct name, which was\r\nLarissa[145], and was said to have been derived from a daughter of\r\nPelasgus so called[146]. Now it may have been the general rule to\r\ncall the citadels of the Pelasgian towns Larissa. If so, then we can\r\nreadily understand that so long as the towns themselves, or rather, it\r\nmight be, the scattered hamlets, remained, the name of the citadels\r\nwould be rarely heard: but when the former fell into decay, the solid\r\nmasonry which the Pelasgi used for walls and for public buildings,\r\nbut which did not extend to private dwellings, would remain. Thus the\r\ncitadels would naturally retain their own old name, which had been\r\noriginally attached to them with reference to their fortifications.\r\nThis hypothesis will fully account for the absorption of the particular\r\nand separate names of towns in the original and common name of their\r\ncitadels.\r\n\r\nWhere an agricultural settlement was made upon ground, some particular\r\nspot of which afforded easy means of fortification, convenience would\r\nprobably dictate the erection of a citadel for occasional retreat in\r\ntime of danger, without any attempt to gather closely into one place\r\nand surround with walls the residences of the settlers: a measure\r\nwhich, as entailing many disadvantages, was only likely to take place\r\nunder the pressure of strong necessity. Such I have presumed to have\r\nbeen the ordinary history of the Pelasgian Larissas. That which, while\r\nit flourished as a Pelasgian settlement, might be an Argos[147], would,\r\nperhaps, after a conquest, and the changes consequent upon it, become\r\nat last a Larissa.\r\n\r\nBut cases might arise in which the most fertile lands, lying entirely\r\nopen and level, would, on the one hand, offer peculiar temptations\r\nto the spoiler, and, on the other, offer no scarped or elevated spot\r\nsuitable for a separate fortification. In such a case the name ἐριβώλαξ\r\nwould be best deserved, and in such a case too the probable result\r\nwould be, to build a walled town including all the habitations of the\r\ncolonists. This walled town would, for the very same reason as the\r\ncitadels elsewhere, be itself a Larissa: and thus this Pelasgian name\r\nmight be a distinctive one in the time of Homer, and yet might become a\r\ncommon one afterwards.\r\n\r\nAll this corresponds with the general belief on the two points, (1)\r\nthat the Pelasgians dwelt, as in Attica, κωμηδὸν, and (2) that the\r\nLarissas are Pelasgian.\r\n\r\nBut moreover it is supported by particular instances. Troy, for\r\nexample, had its Pergama on a lofty part of the site where it stood:\r\nand from the epithets αἰπείνη, ὀφρυόεσσα, ἠνεμόεσσα, applied to the\r\nname Ἴλιος but never to Τροίη (of course I mean when this latter word\r\nis used for the city, the only class of cases in point), it may justly\r\nbe inferred that Ilus[148] built the Pergama when he migrated into the\r\nplain. But the wall surrounding the entire city was only built in the\r\nnext generation, under King Laomedon, who employed Neptune and Apollo\r\nfor the purpose.\r\n\r\nAnother, and perhaps more marked instance, is to be found in the case\r\nof Thebes. We know from Thucydides[149] that Bœotia was, from its\r\nopenness and fertility, more liable to revolutions from successive\r\noccupancy than other parts of Greece. With this statement a passage\r\nof the Odyssey[150] is in remarkable accordance. Homer tells us that\r\nAmphion and Zethus, probably among the very earliest Hellic immigrants\r\ninto Middle Greece, first settled on the site of Thebes; and, he adds\r\nspecially, that they fortified it. But apparently it could not have\r\nbeen the usual practice of the time to surround entire cities, at\r\nleast, with fortifications, because he goes on to assign the special\r\nreason for its being done in this case, namely, that, even powerful as\r\nthey were, they could not hold that country, so open (εὐρύχορος, Od.\r\nxi. 265) and rich, except with the aid of walls. This would appear to\r\nbe a case like the Λαρίσση ἐριβώλαξ of the seventeenth Iliad, and both\r\nalike were probably exceptions to the general rule.\r\n\r\nI have now done with the direct notices of the Pelasgi in Homer. But\r\nwe have still a considerable harvest of indirect notices to gather.\r\nParticularly, in discussing the meaning of the name Ionians, we shall\r\nhereafter find reason to suppose that Homer’s Athenians were Pelasgic:\r\nand I propose here to refer to some similar indications with respect to\r\nthe Arcadians.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Arcadians in Homer._\r\n\r\nLike the Pelasgians, the Arcadians are, as we have seen, happy in never\r\nbeing mentioned without Homer’s commendation. In Il. ii. 611 they are\r\nἐπιστάμενοι πολεμίζειν. In Il. vii. 134 they are ἐγχεσίμωροι.\r\n\r\n_The Arcadians Pelasgian._\r\n\r\nIn the Catalogue he also throws some light upon the habits of the\r\nArcadians: first, by describing them as heavy armed, ἀγχιμάχηται:\r\nsecondly, by stating that they had no care for maritime pursuits.\r\nIn both respects their relation to the Trojans is remarkable. With\r\nthe exception of the Arcadians, the epithet ἀγχιμάχηται is nowhere\r\nused except for the substantive Δάρδανοι, and the position of the\r\nDardanians in Troas very much corresponded with that of the Arcadians\r\nin Greece. Again, the Trojans, as we know, were so entirely destitute\r\nof ships, that Paris had to build them by way of special undertaking.\r\nThese resemblances tend to suggest a further likeness. As the Trojans\r\nappear to have been peculiarly given to the pursuits of peace, it is\r\nreasonable to suppose the poet had the same idea of the Arcadians. The\r\nἀγχιμάχηται is connected with the habits of settled cultivators. A\r\npeasantry furnishes heavy infantry, while light troops are best formed\r\nfrom a population of less settled habits and ruder manners. And as the\r\nuse of ships had much less to do with regular commerce than with piracy\r\nand war,[151] so the absence of maritime habits tends, for the heroic\r\nage, to imply a pacific character. In those days the principal purpose\r\nof easy locomotion was booty: and there was no easy locomotion for\r\nbodies of men, except by ships. Though inclosed by hills, Arcadia was a\r\nhorse feeding[152], therefore relatively not a poor country. In later\r\ntimes it was, next to Laconia[153], the most populous province of the\r\nPeloponnesus; and even in Homer, although its political position was\r\nevidently secondary, it supplied no less than sixty ships with large\r\ncrews to each[154]. All this is favourable to the tradition which gives\r\nit a Pelasgian character.\r\n\r\nAgain, the Arcadians were commanded by Agapenor the son of Ancæus[155].\r\nHe would appear not to have been an indigenous sovereign. For we\r\nlearn from a speech of Nestor in the twenty-third Book[156], that\r\ngames were celebrated at the burial of Amarynceus by the Epeans, in\r\nwhich he himself overcame in wrestling Ancæus the Pleuronian. Ancæus\r\ntherefore was not an Arcadian but an Ætolian: and his son Agapenor was\r\nprobably either the first Arcadian of his race, or else a stranger\r\nappointed by Agamemnon to command the Arcadians in the Trojan war.\r\nTheir having ships from Agamemnon, and a chief either foreign or of\r\nnon-Arcadian extraction, are facts which tend to mark the Arcadians as\r\npolitically dependent, and therefore _pro tanto_ as Pelasgian: for it\r\ncannot be doubted that whatever in Greece was Pelasgian at the epoch\r\nof the _Troica_, was also subordinate to some race of higher and more\r\neffective energies.\r\n\r\nAgain. It will hereafter (I think) be found that the institution of\r\nall gymnastic and martial games was Hellenic and not Pelasgic[157].\r\nIn the passage last quoted there is a very remarkable statement, that\r\nthere were present at the games Epeans, Pylians, and Ætolians: that is\r\nto say, all the neighbouring tribes, except the Arcadians. Thus we have\r\na strong presumption established that these games were not congenial\r\nto Arcadian habits: and if the same can be shown from other sources\r\nwith respect to the Pelasgians, there is a strong presumption that the\r\nArcadians were themselves Pelasgian.\r\n\r\nOnce more. In the sixth book Nestor relates, that in his youth the\r\nPylians and Arcadians fought near the town of Pheiæ and the river\r\nIardanos. The Arcadians were commanded by Ereuthalion, who wore the\r\narmour of Areithous. Areithous had met his death by stratagem from\r\nLycoorgos, who appropriated the armour, and bequeathed it to his\r\nθεραπών, or companion in arms, Ereuthalion. Nestor, on the part of the\r\nPylians, encountered Ereuthalion, and by the aid of Minerva defeated\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nFrom this tale it would appear, first, that Lycoorgus was king of\r\nArcadia. His name savours of Pelasgian origin, from its relation to\r\nΛυκαών of the later tradition respecting Arcadia, and to Lycaon son\r\nof Priam, descended by the mother’s side from the Leleges; again, to\r\nLycaon the father of Pandarus; possibly also to the inhabitants of\r\nLycia. The allusion to his having succeeded by stratagem only, is very\r\npointed (148),\r\n\r\n    τὸν Λυκόοργος ἔπεφνε δόλῳ, οὔτι κράτεΐ γε,\r\n\r\nand the terms employed appear to indicate a military inferiority: which\r\naccords with the probable relation of the Arcadians, as Pelasgi, to\r\ntheir Hellenic neighbours. And this again corresponds with the close\r\nof the story; in which Nestor, fighting on the part of the Pylians who\r\nwere Achæan, and therefore Hellenic, conquers the Arcadian chieftain\r\nEreuthalion (Il. vi. 132-56).\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked once for all, that this military inferiority is not\r\nto be understood as if the Pelasgi were cowards, but simply as implying\r\nthat they gave way before tribes of more marked military genius or\r\nhabits than themselves; as at Hastings the Saxons did before the\r\nNormans; or as the Russians did in the late war of 1854-6 before the\r\nWestern armies.\r\n\r\nLastly, the δῖος applied to Ereuthalion (Il. v. 319), accords with the\r\nuse of that epithet for the Pelasgi elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThus a number of indications from Homer, slight when taken separately,\r\nbut more considerable when combined, and drawn from _all_ the passages\r\nin which Homer refers to Arcadia, converge upon the supposition that\r\nthe Arcadians were a Pelasgian people.\r\n\r\nThey are supported by the whole stream of later tradition; which placed\r\nLycaon, son of Pelasgus, in Arcadia, which uniformly represented the\r\nArcadians as autochthonic[158], and which made them competitors with\r\nthe Argives for the honour of having given to the Pelasgians their\r\noriginal seat in the Peloponnesus.\r\n\r\nHere too philology steps in, and lends us some small aid. The name\r\nof Προσέληνοι, which the Arcadians took to themselves, and which is\r\nassumed to mean older than the moon, appears, when so understood, to\r\nexpress a very forced idea: it is difficult indeed to conceive how\r\nsuch a name could even creep into use. But if we refer its origin to\r\nπρὸ and Σελλοὶ or Σέλληνες, it then becomes the simple indication of\r\nthe historical fact we are looking for, namely, that they, a Pelasgic\r\npopulation, occupied Arcadia before any of the Hellic or Sellic races\r\nhad come into the Peloponnesus.\r\n\r\nFrom its rich pastures, Arcadia was originally well adapted for\r\nPelasgian inhabitants. Defended by mountains, it offered, as Attica\r\ndid through the poverty of its soil, an asylum to the refugees of that\r\nrace, when dispossessed from other still more fertile, and perhaps also\r\nmore accessible tracts of the Peloponnesus[159]. Hence it is easy to\r\naccount both for its original Pelasgian character, and for the long\r\nretention of it.\r\n\r\nWe seem then to find the Arcadians of Homer (first) politically\r\ndependent, and (secondly) commanded by a foreigner, but yet (thirdly)\r\nvaliant in war. It would thus appear that what they wanted was not\r\nanimal or even moral courage, but the political and governing element,\r\nwhich is the main element in high martial talent. All this we shall\r\nfind, as we already have in some degree found, to be a Pelasgian\r\nportraiture. And if it should seem to have been drawn with the aid of\r\nconjecture, let it at any rate be observed that it is supported by\r\nthe Arcadian character in the historic ages. They appear from various\r\nindications to have been for many generations the Swiss of Greece:\r\nnot producing great commanders, and obscure enough, until a very late\r\ndate, in the political annals of the country, but abounding in the\r\nmaterials of a hardy soldiery, and taking service with this or that\r\nsection of the Greeks as chance might dictate. For in Xenophon they\r\nboast that when any of the Greeks wanted auxiliaries (ἐπίκουροι) they\r\ncame to Arcadia to obtain them: that the Lacedæmonians took them into\r\ncompany when they invaded Attica, and that the Thebans did the very\r\nsame when they invaded Lacedæmon[160]. And Thucydides tells us that,\r\nin the Sicilian war, the Mantineans, with a portion of their brother\r\nArcadians, fought for hire with the Athenians on one side, while\r\nanother contingent from the very same State assisted the Corinthians,\r\nwho had come in force to aid in the defence of Syracuse against\r\nthem[161].\r\n\r\n_The Graians: the Pelasgians and Ceres._\r\n\r\nTwo other circumstances, slight in themselves, still remain for notice.\r\n\r\n1. It was through the authority and practice of the Romans that the\r\nname of Greeks or Graians came ultimately to supplant that of Hellenes.\r\nOut of this fact, which is the most important piece of evidence in our\r\npossession, arises the presumption, that as it was the Pelasgians who\r\nmay be said to have supplied the main link between Greece and Italy,\r\nand between the Hellenic and the Roman language, the Graians could not\r\nbut have been a branch or portion of that people. Now we know that the\r\nPelasgians were cultivators of the plains. Bœotia is, as we have seen,\r\nindicated by Thucydides[162] as the richest plain[163] of Greece, and\r\non that account among the parts most liable to the displacement of\r\ntheir inhabitants. It was therefore probably a plain where the Pelasgi\r\nwould have settled early and in numbers: and it deserves notice, that\r\nthe Catalogue[164] placing the town of Graia in Bœotia, places it where\r\nwe naturally assume a large, though now, as in Thessaly, subordinate\r\nPelasgian population to have existed.\r\n\r\nNor is the passage in which Aristotle notices the Γραικοὶ adverse\r\nto the belief that they were a Pelasgian race. He states that the\r\ndeluge of Deucalion was in the ancient Hellas: which is the country\r\nreaching from Dodona to the Achelous (αὕτη δ’ ἐστὶν ἡ περὶ τὴν Δωδώνην\r\nκαὶ τὸν Ἀχελῷον). This may include either great part, or the whole,\r\nof Thessaly: whether we understand it of the little and Thessalian\r\nAchelous, near Lamia, which was within thirty _stadia_ of the\r\nSpercheus[165]: or of the great Achelous, which skirted the western\r\nborder of that country, and whose line of tributaries was fed from the\r\nslopes of Pindus. If we understand the Dodona of Epirus, this will give\r\na considerable range of country, all of it outside Thessaly. Aristotle\r\nproceeds to say, that there dwelt the Selli, and those then called\r\nΓραικοὶ but now Hellenes (καὶ οἱ καλούμενοι τότε μὲν Γραικοὶ νῦν δὲ\r\nἝλληνες). Thus he describes as Γραικοὶ those who, together with the\r\nSelli, were the inhabitants of the country that Homer calls Pelasgic\r\nArgos: so that according to him the Γραικοὶ were not Sellic: and the\r\ntime, when they were thus neighbours of the Selli, was the pre-Hellenic\r\ntime. This is nearly equivalent to an assertion by Aristotle that the\r\nGraians were Pelasgic, for we know of no other pre-Hellenic race in\r\nThessaly[166].\r\n\r\n2. In vv. 695, 6 we find that (Πύρασος) Pyrasus in Thessaly (probably\r\nderiving its name from πυρὸς wheat, grain), is described as Δήμητρος\r\nτέμενος: and it is the only ground consecrated to Ceres that Homer\r\nmentions. It is material that this should be in Thessaly, the\r\nespecially Pelasgic country: for both slight notices in Homer, and\r\nmuch of later tradition, connect the Pelasgi in a peculiar manner with\r\nthe worship of that deity. For example, Pausanias mentions a temple of\r\nΔημήτηρ Πελασγὶς[167] at Corinth even in his own time. This connection\r\nin its turn serves to confirm the character of the Pelasgi as a rural\r\nand agricultural people.\r\n\r\nSo far as this part of the evidence of Homer is concerned, it goes to\r\nthis only, that with the aid of Hesiod it serves to exhibit Ceres in\r\ndirect relations with two countries; both with Thessaly, and, as will\r\nnow be shown, with Crete; in which also, as we know from Homer (brought\r\ndown by Hesiod to a later date), the Pelasgian name still remained when\r\nit had apparently been submerged elsewhere in Greece; and in which\r\ntherefore it may be inferred that the Pelasgian element was more than\r\nusually strong and durable.\r\n\r\nIn the fifth Odyssey[168] we are told that Ceres fell in love with a\r\nson of Iasus (Iasion, in Hesiod Iasios), whom she met νειῷ ἐνὶ τριπόλῳ;\r\nin what country Homer does not say, but Hesiod, repeating the story,\r\nadds it was in Crete, Κρήτης ἐν πίονι δήμῳ[169]. Thus the double\r\nconnection is made good.\r\n\r\nOver and above this, the name Iasus goes of itself to establish a\r\nPelasgian origin.\r\n\r\n1. Because Ἴασον Ἄργος is an old name for the Peloponnesus, or else\r\na large portion of it; whereas the Hellenic name was, as we know,\r\nἈχαικὸν Ἄργος. And the Ἰασίδαι reigned in Orchomenus[170] two or three\r\ngenerations before the Neleids. This probably touches a period when\r\nno Hellic tribes had, as far as we know, found their way into the\r\nPeloponnesus[171], and when the dynasties even of the middle and north\r\nwere, as is probable, chiefly Pelasgian.\r\n\r\n2. Because Ἴασος[172] was the name of one of the Athenian leaders, and\r\nthe Athenians were, as we shall find, manifestly Pelasgian. His father\r\nSphelus is also the son of Boucolus, a name which will be shown to be\r\nof Pelasgic and not Hellenic character[173].\r\n\r\n3. Because Dmetor the son of Iasus was the ruler of Cyprus at the\r\nepoch of the Troica, and that island seems to have stood in an\r\nanomalous relation of half-dependence to Agamemnon, which is best\r\ncapable of explanation if we suppose it to have been inhabited by a\r\npopulation still retaining its Pelasgian character. To this question I\r\nshall shortly have occasion to return in a more full consideration of\r\nthe case of Cyprus.\r\n\r\nOf later tradition, there is abundance to connect Ceres with the\r\nPelasgians: their character as tillers of the soil, and hers as the\r\ngiver of grain: the worship of her at Eleusis, dating from time\r\nimmemorial, and purporting to be founded upon rites different from\r\nthose in vogue at a later epoch: this too taken in connection with the\r\nPelasgian origin of Athens, and its long retention of that character.\r\nIn the ancient hymn to Ceres, estranged from Jupiter and the other\r\ngods, she comes to Eleusis, and there herself founds the worship; and\r\nshe announces in her tale that she was come from Crete:\r\n\r\n    νῦν αὖτε Κρήτηθεν, ἐπ’ εὐρέα νῶτα θαλάσσης,\r\n    ἤλυθον, οὐκ ἐθέλουσα[174].\r\n\r\nI even venture to suggest it as possible that the existence of a\r\nτέμενος (or land devoted to the service of any deity) at all, affords\r\na presumption of a Pelasgic population and institutions. For we find\r\nonly three other cases of such endowments: all in places strongly\r\nmarked with a Pelasgic character. One is that of the river Sperchius\r\nin Thessaly: a second that of Venus in Cyprus; and the third that of\r\nJupiter in Gargarus[175].\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Ionians._\r\n\r\nThe notices of the Ionians contained in Homer are faint and few: but\r\nthey are in entire contradiction with the prevailing tradition.\r\n\r\nThe word Ἰάονες occurs only once in the poems, where we find the five\r\ncontingents of Bœotians, Ionians, Locrians, Phthians, and Epeans,\r\nunited in resisting, but ineffectually, Hector’s attack upon the\r\nships. They are here termed ἑλκεχίτωνες[176], an epithet which is\r\nunfortunately nowhere else employed by the poet. The order in which\r\nthey are named is,\r\n\r\n  1. Bœotians,\r\n  2. Ionians,\r\n  3. Locrians,\r\n  4. Phthians,\r\n  5. Epeans.\r\n\r\nA description thus commences in three parts, of which the first is\r\n(689-91),\r\n\r\n    οἱ μὲν Ἀθηναίων προλελεγμένοι· ἐν δ’ ἄρα τοῖσιν\r\n    ἦρχ’ υἷος Πετεῶο, Μενεσθεύς· οἱ δ’ ἅμ’ ἕποντο\r\n    Φείδας τε Στιχίος τε, Βίας τ’ ἐΰς·\r\n\r\nThe second describes the leaders of the Epeans: the third of the\r\nPhthians, and these, it says, meaning apparently the Phthian force,\r\nfought in conjunction with the Bœotians, μετὰ Βοιωτῶν ἐμάχοντο\r\n(700). No Bœotian leaders are named: the absence of Oilean Ajax, who\r\nofficially led the Locrians, is immediately accounted for by saying\r\nthat he was with his inseparable friend, the Telamonian chief.\r\n\r\nThese Ἰάονες ἑλκεχίτωνες then were the προλελεγμένοι, a chosen band\r\nof the Athenian force; or else they were the force composed of men\r\npicked among the Athenians. But no distinguished quality or act of\r\nwar is recounted of the Athenians, either here or elsewhere in the\r\nIliad. They are simply called μηστῶρες ἀüτῆς,[177] but this is a mere\r\ngeneral epithet, has no reference to any particular conduct, and is not\r\nsustained by any relation of their feats in arms. The five divisions\r\nabove named fight in order to be beaten by the Trojans: and we may be\r\nsure that Homer does not produce the flower of the Greeks for such a\r\npurpose. Nor has the Athenian chief Menestheus any distinction whatever\r\naccorded to him, even in the much questioned passage of the Catalogue,\r\nexcept that of being excellent at marshalling forces.\r\n\r\n_The Athenians in the Catalogue._\r\n\r\nThe passage Il. ii. 546-56, describing the Athenians in the Catalogue,\r\nis of so much historical interest through the various points it\r\ninvolves, as to deserve a particular consideration, which it may\r\nbest receive in this place. Upon it depends some part of the Homeric\r\nevidence relating to the signs of a Pelasgian origin.\r\n\r\nThree lines of it must in any case be allowed to remain, in order to\r\ndescribe the Athenian contingent and its commander.\r\n\r\n    οἱ δ’ ἄρ’ Ἀθήνας εἶχον, ἐϋκτίμενον πτολίεθρον ... (v. 546.)\r\n\r\n    τῶν αὖθ’ ἡγεμόνευ’ υἷος Πετεῶο Μενεσθεύς. (552.)\r\n\r\n    τῷ δ’ ἅμα πεντήκοντα μέλαιναι νῆες ἕποντο. (556.)\r\n\r\nTo the supposition that this jejune _minimum_ represents the passage\r\nin its original form, it is certainly an objection, that in no other\r\nplace of the whole Catalogue has Homer dispatched quite so drily and\r\nsummarily any important division of the force.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the passage falls into three portions, of which the\r\nfirst is separable from the two others, and the first with the second\r\nis also separable from the third. They are as follows:\r\n\r\n(1)--vv. 546-9.\r\n\r\n    οἱ δ’ ἄρ’ Ἀθήνας εἶχον, ἐϋκτίμενον πτολίεθρον,\r\n    δῆμον Ἐρεχθῆος μεγαλήτορος, ὅν ποτ’ Ἀθήνη\r\n    θρέψε Διὸς θυγάτηρ, τέκε δὲ ζείδωρος Ἄρουρα,\r\n    κὰδ δ’ ἐν Ἀθήνῃσ’ εἷσεν, ἑῷ ἐνὶ πίονι νηῷ.\r\n\r\nThere is a reading of Ἀθήνης for Ἀθηνῃσ’: it is disputed whether τέκε\r\napplies to δῆμον or to Erechtheus; whether ἑῷ is to be understood of\r\nErechtheus or of Minerva; and again, what is the meaning of πίονι as\r\napplied to νηῷ? The variety of lection is not material: the application\r\nof τέκε is clearly to Erechtheus, as seems also that of ἑῷ to\r\nMinerva[178]. Again, the application of the epithet πίονι to the temple\r\nis perhaps sufficiently supported by Od. xii. 346, πίονα νηὸν, and Il.\r\nv. 512, μάλα πίονος ἐξ ἀδύτοιο.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that these lines, or the two which follow, were\r\nrejected by the Alexandrian critics, but the Pseudo-Herodotus, in the\r\nLife of Homer, c. 28, states that they were interpolated.\r\n\r\nThe objections from internal evidence are stated by Payne Knight[179].\r\n\r\n1. That the Greeks had no temples at the time of the _Troica_.\r\n\r\n2. That as Ἄρουρα is _superficies non orbis Terræ_, so it was not a\r\nknown personification at the time of Homer.\r\n\r\nAs to the first of these, we hear of Trojan temples in the Iliad;\r\nprobably also of the Greek temple of Apollo in Il. ix. 404; and of\r\nGreek temples in the Odyssey, beyond all reasonable doubt. We hear\r\nof Ætolian priests in Il. ix. 575; while it is not likely that there\r\nshould have been priests without temples.\r\n\r\nAgain, the circumstances of the Greeks in the Iliad were not such as to\r\nlead to the mention of temples usually or frequently. Therefore this is\r\nnot a ground of suspicion against the passage.\r\n\r\nAs to the second objection, it should be borne in mind that the\r\nEarth, Γαῖα, as well as Ἄρουρα, was apparently to Homer, not less\r\nthan to the other ancients, a surface, not a solid (κυκλοτερὴς ὡς ἀπὸ\r\nτόρνου, Herod. iv. 36.) The objection really is, that Ἄρουρα means a\r\nparticular class of ground, namely, arable or cultivable land; and that\r\nto personify this class of land by itself is artificial, far-fetched,\r\nand not in the manner of Homer.\r\n\r\nTo me it appears clear that it would be unnatural for us, but very\r\ndoubtful whether it was so for Homer. We could not in poetry well\r\ntreat Corn-field or Garden as a person: but the corn-bearing Earth\r\n(ζείδωρος Ἄρουρα) had for the Greeks in their early days a vividness of\r\nmeaning, which it has not for us. To us, to the modern European mind,\r\nthe gifts of Ceres are but one item in an interminable list of things\r\nenjoyable and enjoyed: to man when yet youthful, while in his first\r\nruder contact with his mother Earth and the elements, while possessed\r\nof few instruments and no resources, this idea was as determinate, as\r\nit was likewise suggestive and poetical. The Latins have no word by\r\nwhich to render the word Ἄρουρα in its full meaning, though _arvum_\r\nmust have been taken from it, or from the same root with it. It nearly\r\ncorresponds with the English ‘glebe’ in its proper use[180]. It\r\nsignifies not only corn land, but all productive land, for instance,\r\nvine land, in Il. iii. 246. But to them, so pregnant was the idea,\r\nthat besides a crop of epithets such as πολύφορβος and τραφέρη, it\r\nthrew off its own inverted image in the epithet, habitual with Homer,\r\nof ἀτρύγετος for θάλασσα, the un-cornbearing sea. Now when the idea\r\nof corn land had been thus vividly conceived, the next step, that of\r\nviewing Ἄρουρα as Γαῖα, was one not very hard to take. The objection\r\nseems to arise out of our unconsciously reading Homer in the false\r\nlight of our own familiar associations.\r\n\r\nHis text affords evidence in support of these views. May it not be\r\nsaid that the phrase πάτρις Ἄρουρα[181] for _patria_ shows us a great\r\nstep towards personification? In the Νεκυία (Od. xi. 489), ἐπάρουρος\r\nis equivalent to ‘alive;’ compare Il. xvii. 447. Again, Ulysses,\r\nthe moment he escapes from the river mouth to the shore, kisses the\r\nζείδωρος Ἄρουρα[182] among the reeds: which seems to show an use of the\r\nterm nearly synonymous with Γαῖα or earth. And again, praying for the\r\nglory of Alcinous[183], he says,\r\n\r\n              τοῦ μέν κεν ἐπὶ ζείδωρον ἄρουραν\r\n    ἄσβεστον κλέος εἴη.\r\n\r\nThe fame of Alcinous could not be confined to fields. So the setting\r\nsun casts shadows on the ἐρίβωλος Ἄρουρα[184]. In both cases the\r\nterm so approximates to the meaning of Earth, doubtless by metonymy,\r\nas to be indistinguishable from it. Again Il. iv. 174, σέο δ’ ὄστεα\r\nπύσει Ἄρουρα. Surely the meaning here is Earth, for we are not to\r\nsuppose Homer meant to say the bodies of his warriors would lie on\r\nthe cultivable land only. But another passage brings us up to actual\r\npersonification, that respecting Otus and Ephialtes\r\n\r\n    οὓς δὴ μηκίστους θρέψε ζείδωρος Ἄρουρα[185].\r\n\r\nThis objection to Ἄρουρα therefore will not hold good: and the passage\r\ncannot be condemned upon internal evidence. It is referred to by Plato,\r\nin the first Alcibiades[186].\r\n\r\n(2)--Vss. 550, 1.\r\n\r\n    ἐνθάδε μιν ταύροισι καὶ ἀρνείοις ἱλάονται\r\n    κοῦροι Ἀθηναίων, περιτελλομένων ἐνιαυτῶν.\r\n\r\nSome refer μιν to Minerva, and construe the passage with reference to\r\nthe Panathenaic celebration. When so interpreted, as it is contended,\r\nthe words betray a palpable anachronism.\r\n\r\nAgain it is alleged, (1) Homer does not in the Catalogue introduce\r\ngeneral descriptions of the religious rites of Greece, and it is\r\nscarcely likely he should mention here a celebration, which he does not\r\nreport to have had anything peculiar in its character. (2) From xi.\r\n729 it appears that cows were sacrificed to Minerva, not bulls: (3)\r\nthe tenour of the sentence directs us to Erechtheus, and it involves\r\nworship offered to a local hero.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Panathenaica, a difficulty would undoubtedly\r\narise, if we were obliged to suppose that it contained a reference to\r\ngymnastic games, which we have every reason to treat as having borne in\r\nthe age of Homer a marked Hellenic character[187]. But the words imply\r\nno such reference. They speak, at the most, of no more than periodical\r\nsacrifices. This implies an established festival, and nothing beyond\r\nit. Now such a signification raises no presumption whatever against\r\nthe genuineness of the passage: because we have one distinct and\r\nunquestionable case in Homer of an established festival of a deity,\r\nthat namely of Apollo in the Odyssey. The day of the vengeance of\r\nUlysses was the ἑορτὴ τοῖο Θεοῖο ἁγνή[188].\r\n\r\nSo considering the passage, let us next examine the objection taken\r\nto it, that it involves hero-worship[189], which was not known in the\r\nHomeric age.\r\n\r\nNow we have in the Odyssey, as well as here in the Iliad, cases of\r\nmortals translated to heaven and to the company of immortals.\r\n\r\nIn the Odyssey we have, for example, the case of Castor and Pollux,\r\nwho enjoyed a peculiar privilege of life after death, and revisited\r\nearth in some mysterious manner on alternate days[190]. And this, too,\r\nalthough they were buried[191].\r\n\r\nTheir τίμη πρὸς Ζηνὸς was such that, as the passage in Od. xi. proceeds\r\nto state, they vied with deities;\r\n\r\n    τίμην δὲ λελόγχασ’ ἶσα θεοῖσιν.\r\n\r\nThis τίμη must have included honour paid on earth: to be in heaven,\r\nunless in connection with earth and its inhabitants, was not of\r\nitself a τίμη, much less was it the τίμη of the gods. The subject\r\nof hero-worship will be further examined in a later portion of this\r\nwork: but for the present it appears sufficiently, that this comes\r\nnear to hero-worship. The passage about Erechtheus is no more than a\r\ndevelopment of the expression relating to the Tyndarid brothers; and,\r\nthough by some steps in advance of it, can hardly be rejected on this\r\nground alone as spurious. All passages cannot be expected to express\r\nwith precisely the same degree of fulness the essential ideas on which\r\nthey are founded; and we are not entitled to cut off, on that ground\r\nalone, the one which happens to be most in advance.\r\n\r\nBut although the application to Erechtheus might not convict the\r\npassage, I very much question whether we ought so to apply it. It is\r\nquite against the general bearing of the passage, which would much\r\nmore naturally refer it to Minerva. The reason for it is that cows or\r\nheifers were offered to her, and not rams or bulls. No doubt, in the\r\nparticular cases mentioned to us, (Il. vi. 94, x. 292, xi. 729, and Od.\r\niii. 382,) cows or heifers only are spoken of. But in Od. iii. 145 we\r\nare told that ἑκατομβαὶ were to be offered to her, which we can hardly\r\nlimit so rigidly: and considering that the cases of cows mentioned by\r\nHomer are all special, while this passage speaks of what was ordinary\r\nand periodical, I think we should pause before admitting that the\r\napplication of the lines to Minerva is on this ground indefensible.\r\n\r\nThe word περιτελλομένων[192] is taken to mean not annual revolutions,\r\nbut the revolutions of periods of years. I question the grounds of this\r\ninterpretation: but, if it could be established, it would certainly\r\nrather weaken the passage; for Homer nowhere else mentions periodical\r\ncelebrations of any kind divided by any number of years, and I doubt\r\nwhether such an idea does not involve greater familiarity with\r\nnumerical combinations than the Poet seems to have possessed.\r\n\r\nLeaving these two lines subject to some doubt, but by no means fully\r\nconvicted, let us proceed to the third and last of the contested\r\nportions of the passage.\r\n\r\n(3)--Vss. 553-5.\r\n\r\n    τῷ δ’ οὔπω τις ὁμοῖος ἐπιχθόνιος γένετ’ ἄνηρ\r\n    κοσμήσαι ἵππους τε καὶ ἀνέρας ἀσπιδιώτας·\r\n    Νέστωρ οἶος ἔριζεν· ὁ γὰρ προγενέστερος ἦεν.\r\n\r\nThese lines were condemned by Zenodotus[193] upon the ground that we\r\nhave no other mention of these gifts of Menestheus, and no example of\r\nhis putting them in exercise. Mr. Payne Knight[194] also urges that\r\nMenestheus, here so commended with respect to chariots as well as\r\ninfantry, does not even appear as a competitor in the chariot-race\r\nat the funeral games of Patroclus, although, in order to enlarge the\r\ncompetition, even the slow horses of Nestor are put in requisition.\r\n\r\nThe Scholiast answers, with regard to the first objection, and\r\nHeyne[195] accepts the defence as sufficient, that other persons are\r\npraised in the gross, of whom no details are given anywhere: as Machaon\r\nis called ἀριστεύων in Il. xi. 506. But a mere general epithet is very\r\ndifferent from a set passage of three lines expressing extraordinary\r\npreeminence in particular accomplishments.\r\n\r\nAgain, the word applied to Machaon is by no means one of abstract\r\npanegyric, but is itself a description of the activity in the field by\r\nwhich he was at the moment baffling the energies of Hector, and would,\r\nsays the Poet, have continued to baffle them, had not Paris wounded\r\nhim. Thus the word is not a vague epithet: the words παῦσεν ἀριστεύοντα\r\nΜαχάονα simply mean, that the manful exertions of Machaon were arrested.\r\n\r\nThere is another objection to the passage in the rather inflated\r\ncharacter of its compliment to an undistinguished man. Even\r\nNestor[196], it says, did not beat him, but only (ἔριζεν) vied with\r\nhim: and this not as an abler, but only as an older, man.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some of the Scholiasts ingeniously suggest that\r\nthese verses are given to Menestheus by way of compensation; τοῦτο\r\nχαρίζεται αὐτῷ, ἐπεὶ μὴ εὐδοκιμήσει ἐν ταῖς μάχαις[197]. But Homer\r\ndoes not usually deal out compensation, among the Greeks, by abstract\r\npraises, for the want of the honour earned by deeds: and all the other\r\nmartial eulogies on chiefs in the Catalogue are well borne out in the\r\npoem.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, Mr. Payne Knight’s objection, and the judgment of the\r\nAlexandrine Critics, seem to leave this part of the passage in a state\r\nso questionable, that nothing ought to be rested on it. The best\r\npoint in its favour is, that the Athenian Legates before Gelon are\r\nrepresented by Herodotus as confidently relying on it, when there would\r\nhave been an interest on his part in demurring to its authority, for\r\nit was a question of military precedence that was at issue: τῶν καὶ\r\nὍμηρος ὁ ἐποποιὸς ἄνδρα ἄριστον ἔφησε εἰς Ἴλιον ἀπικέσθαι, τάξαι τε καὶ\r\nδιακοσμῆσαι στράτον[198].\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it may be observed with justice that the compliment\r\nhere paid to Menestheus is the very best of which the case admitted;\r\nperhaps the only one that an interpolator would have been safe in\r\nselecting. For he would have known that any panegyric relating to\r\nstrength or prowess in action would be conclusively belied by the rest\r\nof the poem in its entire tenour.\r\n\r\nBut while we cannot confidently rely upon these three lines, there\r\nappears to be no reason why we should not use the evidence supplied\r\nby the rest of the passage as most probably good historic matter. It\r\nundoubtedly represents a strong course of old local tradition[199]:\r\nfor there was in Athens a most ancient temple dedicated to Minerva and\r\nErechtheus in conjunction.\r\n\r\n_Review of the Homeric evidence._\r\n\r\nThe Homeric evidence then up to this point stands as follows with\r\nreference to Athens and the Athenian contingent, or the principal and\r\npicked men of it, whichever be the best term for the passage. They were\r\n\r\n1. Ionians, Il. xiii. 685.\r\n\r\n2. ἑλκεχίτωνες, ibid.\r\n\r\n3. Autochthonous, Il. ii. 547.\r\n\r\n4. Undistinguished in the war.\r\n\r\n5. Under the special patronage of Pallas or Minerva, Il. ii. 546, and\r\nOd. xi. 323, where the epithet ἱεράων, given to Athens, indicates a\r\nspecial relation to a deity.\r\n\r\nThe epithet ἑλκεχίτωνες suggests unwarlike habits, and, though\r\nmore faintly, it also betokens textile industry. It stands in\r\nmarked contrast with the ἀμιτροχίτωνες[200] of the valiant Lycians,\r\nwhose short and spare tunic required no cincture to confine it. It\r\ncorroborates the negative evidence afforded by the Iliad of some want\r\nof martial genius in the primitive Athens. It coincides with the\r\ntutelage of Pallas, for the Minerva of Homer has no more indisputable\r\nfunction than as the goddess of skilled industry[201]. All this tends\r\nto betoken that the inhabitants of the Homeric Attica were Pelasgian.\r\n\r\nAgain, the autochthonic origin, ascribed to the Athenians in the person\r\nof Erechtheus, amounts to an assertion that they were the first known\r\ninhabitants of the country: in other words, that they were Pelasgian.\r\n\r\nThe negative evidence is also important. There is nothing in Homer that\r\ntends to associate Athens with the Hellenic stem. The want of military\r\ndistinction deserves a fuller notice.\r\n\r\nIt can hardly be without meaning, that of all the chiefs, considerable\r\nin the Iliad by their positions and commands, there are but two who are\r\nnever named as in actual fight, or with any other mark of distinction,\r\nand these two are the heads of the two (as we suppose) emphatically\r\nPelasgian contingents, from Athens and Arcadia respectively. Agapenor,\r\nwho (being however of Ætolian extraction) leads the Arcadians, is named\r\nnowhere but in the Catalogue: Menestheus is repeatedly named, but never\r\nwith reference to fighting. In the only part of the action of the poem\r\nwhere he is put forward, he shudders[202], and shows an anxiety for his\r\npersonal safety, much more like a Trojan leader than a Greek one. Yet\r\nthey were sole commanders, the first of no less than sixty ships, the\r\nsecond of fifty. There are no similar cases. The nearest to them are\r\nthose (1) of Prothous[203], who commands 40 ships of the Magnesians,\r\nand Gourieus[204], who leads 22 of the Enienes and Perrhæbi: both of\r\nthese are remote, Thessalian, and very probably Pelasgian tribes: (2)\r\nof Podarkes, who commands 40 ships, but only as deputy for his deceased\r\nbrother Protesilaus, who is said to have been not only the elder, but\r\nthe more valiant[205].\r\n\r\nAgapenor, indeed, was evidently dependent in a peculiar sense on\r\nAgamemnon, in whose ships he sailed: but this could not affect his\r\nposition as to personal prowess. The case of Menestheus is the more\r\nremarkable from this circumstance, that he is the only independent\r\nand single commander in charge of so many as fifty ships, who is not\r\ninvested with the supreme rank of Βασιλεὺς or King. His father Peteos\r\nis however called Διοτρεφὴς Βασιλεὺς (Il. iv. 338), which marks him as\r\nhaving probably been a person of greater importance.\r\n\r\nAnd what is true of the commanders is true also of the troops.\r\nAthens, and with her Arcadia, may justly be regarded as the only two\r\nundistinguished in Homer among those states of Greece which afterwards\r\nattained to distinction. For among the States which acquired fame in\r\nthe historic ages, Argolis, Achaia, and Laconia hold through their\r\nchiefs very high places in the poem: Elis and Bœotia are conspicuous\r\nin the anterior traditions which it enshrines. Only Attica and Arcadia\r\nfail in exhibiting to us signs of early pre-eminence in the arts of\r\nwar: which in a marked manner confirms the suppositions we have already\r\nobtained, as to the Pelasgian character of their inhabitants.\r\n\r\nA sign, though a more uncertain one, that points in the same\r\ndirection, is afforded by the choice of Athens, on the part of\r\nOrestes[206], as his place of habitation during the tyranny of\r\nÆgisthus in Mycenæ. The displaced, if they do not fly to the strong\r\nfor protection, go among those who are weaker, and where they may most\r\neasily hold their ground, or even acquire power afresh. In other words,\r\nin the case before us, an Hellenic exile would very naturally betake\r\nhimself among a Pelasgian people.\r\n\r\nWhile however the indications of a predominating Pelasgian character\r\namong the Athenians at the epoch of the _Troica_ appear to be varied\r\nand powerful, I must admit that they are crossed by one indication,\r\nwhich is at first sight of an opposite character, I mean that which is\r\nafforded by their name. Even though we were to surrender the entire\r\npassages in the Catalogue respecting them, it would still be difficult\r\nto contend that the name of Athens and of Athenians is forged in six\r\nother places of the poems where one or the other of them is found,\r\nbesides that there is a second allusion to Erechtheus in the Odyssey.\r\nHere we have then, attached to a people whom we suppose Pelasgian, a\r\nname connecting them immediately with a deity commonly reputed to be\r\nof strong Hellic propensities: connecting them, indeed, in a manner\r\nso special as to be exclusive, because no other city or population in\r\nHomer takes its name from a deity at all. This indicates a relation of\r\nthe closest description: and it is quite independent of the suspected\r\npassage, which represents Minerva as the nurse or foster-mother of\r\nErechtheus.\r\n\r\n_Athenian relations with Minerva._\r\n\r\nNow it will be found, upon close examination, that Minerva plays a\r\nvery different part in the Iliad from Juno, the great protectress\r\nof the Greeks, and from Neptune, their actual comrade in fight. The\r\ndifference even at first sight is this, that theirs appears to be\r\na national, hers more a personal and moral sentiment. In Juno, it\r\nis sympathy with the Greeks as Greeks; in Neptune, antipathy to the\r\nTrojans as Trojans: but both cases are plainly distinguishable from the\r\ntemper and attitude of Minerva.\r\n\r\nHer protection of Ulysses, whose character is the human counterpart\r\nof her own, is the basis of the whole theurgy of the Odyssey, and is\r\nalso strongly marked in the Δολώνεια. Again, she comes, in the first\r\nbook[207], at the instance of Juno, to restrain and guide Achilles:\r\nfor Juno, it is stated, loved both Agamemnon and Achilles alike; which\r\nmay imply, that this was not the exact case with Minerva. So again,\r\nshe inspires Diomed[208] for the work of his ἀριστεῖα, with a view to\r\nhis personal distinction[209]. On each of the two occasions when the\r\ntwo goddesses come down together from heaven, it is Juno that makes\r\nthe proposal. When Minerva prompts Pandarus to treachery, it is by\r\nthe injunction of Jupiter, issued on the suggestion of Juno[210]. In\r\nthe seventh book, however, she descends of herself on seeing that the\r\nGreeks lose ground, tells Apollo that she was come, as he was, with\r\nthe intention to stay the battle[211], and the result of their counsel\r\nis one of the single fights (that between Hector and Ajax), which were\r\nsure to issue in glory to the Greek heroes. Still she has not the rabid\r\nvirulence against Troy which distinguishes Juno, which makes her exact\r\nthe decision for its destruction in the Olympian assembly, and which\r\nleads Jupiter to say to her sarcastically, that if she could but\r\neat Priam and his children and subjects raw, then her anger would be\r\nsatiated.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Juno has all the marks of a deity entirely Hellic: both in the\r\npassionate character of her attachment, and in the absence of all signs\r\nwhatever of any practical relation between her and the Trojan people.\r\n\r\nIt is not so with Pallas. Pitilessly opposed to the Trojans in the\r\nwar, she is nowhere so identified with the Greeks as to exhibit her\r\nin the light of one of those deities, whose influence or sympathies\r\nwere confined to any one place or nation. Her enmity to Troy is\r\nmythologically founded on the Judgment of Paris[212]: but it has a more\r\nsubstantive ethical ground in the nature of the quarrel between the two\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nUnlike Juno and Neptune, she was regularly worshipped at Troy, where\r\nshe had a priestess of high rank, and a temple placed, like that of\r\nApollo, on the height of Pergamus.\r\n\r\nDistinct proof, however, that Minerva was neither originally at war\r\nwith the Trojans, nor unknown to them by her beneficial influences, is\r\nafforded by the case of Phereclus son of Harmonides, the carpenter;\r\nthis Phereclus was the builder of the ships of Paris, and was a highly\r\nskilled workman[213] by her favour,\r\n\r\n    ἐξόχα γάρ μιν ἐφίλατο Πάλλας Ἀθήνη.\r\n\r\nThe name of Harmonides may be fictitious; but the relation to Pallas\r\ndeserves remark, if we assume Troy to have been fundamentally\r\nPelasgian; and it affords a strong presumption, that there was nothing\r\nin the character of Minerva to prevent her being propitious to a\r\nPelasgian country. Her attributes as the goddess of industry, or more\r\nstrictly, in our phrase, of manufacture, were indeed in no special\r\nharmony with the character of the Pelasgians, as she had nothing to do\r\nwith works of agriculture: but neither was there any antagonism between\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThere is also something that deserves notice in the speech in which\r\nMinerva expresses to Juno her resentment at the restraint put upon\r\nher by Jupiter. She accuses him of forgetting the services she had\r\nso often rendered to Hercules when he was oppressed by the labours\r\nthat Eurystheus had laid upon him, and declares that it was she who\r\neffected his escape from Hades[214]. Now this has all the appearance of\r\nbeing the fabulous dress of the old tradition, which reports that the\r\nchildren of Hercules had taken refuge in Attica, and had been harboured\r\nthere; that Eurystheus invaded the country in consequence of the\r\nprotection thus given, and that he was slain while upon the expedition.\r\nIt seems therefore possible, that this reception of the Heraclids may\r\nhave had something to do with the special relation, at the epoch of\r\nthe _Troica_, between Athens and Minerva as its tutelary goddess? In\r\nconnection with Hercules personally, the Iliad affords us another mark\r\nthat friendly relations might subsist between Troy and Pallas. She, in\r\nconjunction with them,\r\n\r\n    Τρῶες καὶ Πάλλας Ἀθήνη[215],\r\n\r\nerected the rampart in which Hercules took refuge from the pursuing\r\nmonster.\r\n\r\nBut the full answer to the objection is of a wider scope, and is to\r\nbe found in the general character of this deity, which did not, like\r\ninferior conceptions, admit of being circumscribed by the limits of a\r\nparticular district or people.\r\n\r\nIt will hereafter be shewn, that, like Latona and Apollo in\r\nparticular, Minerva in Pagan fiction represents a disguised and\r\nsolitary fragment of the true primeval tradition[216]. All such\r\ndeities we may expect to find, and we do find, transmitted from the\r\nold Pelasgians into the mythologies both of Greece and Rome, or those\r\ncommon to Pelasgian and Hellene. We expect to find, and we do find,\r\nthem worshipped both among the Greeks and among the Trojans as gods,\r\nnot of this or that nation, but of the great human family. In theory,\r\nexclusive regard to the one side or the other comports far better with\r\nthe idea of such deities as represent unruly passions or propensities\r\nof our nature like Mars and Venus, or Mercury; or chief physical forces\r\nlike Neptune; or such as, like Juno, are the sheer product of human\r\nimagination reflected upon the world above, and have no relation to any\r\nelement or part of a true theology. But the Homeric Jupiter, in so far\r\nas he is a representative of supreme power and unity, and the Pallas\r\nand Apollo of the poems by a certain moral elevation, and by various\r\nincidents of their birth or attributes, show a nobler parentage[217].\r\n\r\nIn the capacity of a traditive deity, Minerva is with perfect\r\nconsistency worshipped alike among Trojans and Greeks, Hellenic and\r\nPelasgian tribes. There is nothing strange, then, in our finding her\r\nthe patroness of a Pelasgian people. The only strangeness is her being\r\n(if so she was) more specially their patroness than of any other\r\npeople. The very fact that, for the purposes of the war, Homer gives\r\nher to the Greeks, might perhaps have prepared us to expect that we\r\nshould find her special domicile among the Hellic portions of that\r\nnation: but it supplies no absolute and conclusive reason for such\r\na domicile. But I close the discussion with these observations. In\r\nthe first place, the Pelasgian character of the Athenians in early\r\ntimes is established by evidence too strong to be countervailed by\r\nany such inference as we should be warranted in drawing to a contrary\r\neffect from the special connection with Minerva. Again, it may be that\r\nthe connection of both with Hercules may contain a solution of the\r\ndifficulty. But lastly, if, as we shall find reason to believe, the\r\ntraditive deities were the principal gods of ancient Greece, and if the\r\nentrance of the Hellic tribes brought in many new claimants upon the\r\ndivine honours, it may after all seem not unreasonable that we should\r\nfind, in one of the most purely Pelasgian States, the worship of this\r\ngreat traditive deity less obscured than elsewhere by competition with\r\nthat of the invaders, and consequently in more peculiar and conspicuous\r\nhonour.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the etymology of certain names in Homer will\r\nhereafter, I trust, confirm these reasonings on the Athens of\r\nthe heroic age: with this exception, we may now bid adieu to the\r\ninvestigation of the Homeric evidence of Pelasgianism in Attica.\r\n\r\n_Post-Homeric evidence._\r\n\r\nThat evidence certainly receives much confirmation, positive and\r\nnegative, from without. In the first place, though Hesiod supplies us\r\nwith an Hellen, and with a Dorus and Æolus among his sons, he says not\r\na word of an Ion; and the tradition connecting Ion with Hellen through\r\nXuthus is of later date: probably later than Euripides, who makes\r\nIon only the adopted son of Xuthus an Achæan[218], and the real son\r\nof Creusa, an Erectheid; with Apollo, a Hellic, but also a Pelasgian\r\ndeity, for his father. Again, in the legendary times we do not hear of\r\nthe Athenians as invaders and conquerors, which was the character of\r\nthe Hellic tribes, but usually as themselves invaded; for example, by\r\nEurystheus from the Peloponnesus.\r\n\r\nIn ancient tradition generally, the Athenians appear on the defensive\r\nagainst Bœotians[219], Cretans, or others. And the reputed Pylian and\r\nNeleid descent of the Pisistratid family is a curious illustration of\r\nthe manner in which Attica was reported to have imported from abroad\r\nthe most energetic elements of her own population[220], and also of the\r\n(so to speak) natural predominance of Hellic over Pelasgic blood.\r\n\r\nThucydides[221] informs us, that the Athenians were first among the\r\nGreeks to lay aside the custom of bearing arms, and to cultivate ease\r\nand luxury. Of this we have perhaps already had an indication in the\r\nwords ἑλκεχίτωνες.\r\n\r\nHe also states that, on account of the indifferent soil[222], which\r\noffered no temptation comparable to those supplied by the more fertile\r\nportions of Greece, there was no ejection of the inhabitants from\r\nAttica by stronger claimants. Τὴν γοῦν Ἀττικὴν, ἐκ τοῦ ἐπὶ πλεῖστον διὰ\r\nτὸ λεπτογέων ἀστασίαστον οὖσαν, ἄνθρωποι ᾤκουν οἱ αὐτοὶ ἀεί. This is\r\nsimply stating in another form what was usually expressed by declaring\r\nthem autochthons. It is part of their Pelasgian title.\r\n\r\nA remarkable passage in Herodotus covers the whole breadth of the\r\nground that has here been taken; and it is important, because no doubt\r\nit expresses what that author considered to be the best of the current\r\ntraditions, founded in notoriety, and what Crœsus likewise learned\r\nupon a formal inquiry, undertaken with a view to alliances in Greece,\r\nrespecting the origin of the Athenians. Herodotus, like Homer, makes\r\nthe Athenians Ionian; and in conformity with the construction here\r\nput upon Homer, he declares the Ionians not to be Hellenic, but to be\r\nPelasgian[223]. The Attic people, he goes on to say, having once been\r\nPelasgian became Hellenic[224]. According to some opinions[225], this\r\nchange occurred when the Ionians came into Attica: but the evidence\r\nof Homer, I think, makes Athens Ionian at the same epoch when it\r\nis Pelasgian. I therefore construe the statement of Herodotus as\r\nsignifying that the Athenians, in the course of time, received among\r\nthemselves Hellenic immigrants from the more disturbed and changeful\r\nparts of Greece, and these immigrants impressed on Attica, as they had\r\ndone on other states[226], the Hellenic character and name; only with\r\nthe difference that, instead of a conflict, and the subjugation of\r\nthe original inhabitants, there came a process of more harmonious and\r\ngenial absorption, and in consequence, a development of Greek character\r\neven more remarkable for its fulness than in any other Grecian race.\r\nEven in the case of Attica, however, the Hellenic character was not\r\nfinally assumed without a collision, though perhaps a local and partial\r\none only, which ended in the ejectment of the Pelasgians. This conflict\r\nis reported to us by Herodotus from Hecatæus[227], and if we find that\r\nin it, according to the Athenian version of the story, the Pelasgians\r\nwere the wrong-doers, it is probably upon the ground that the winner\r\nis always in the right: and the Athenians had the more need of a case,\r\nbecause their policy demanded a justification, when, under Miltiades,\r\nthey followed the Pelasgians to Lemnos, and again subdued them there.\r\nEach version of the Attican quarrel contains indications of being\r\nrelated to the truth of the case: for the Pelasgians are made to\r\ndeclare, that the Athenians drove them out from the soil of which they\r\nwere the prior occupants, and which they cultivated so carefully as to\r\narouse their envy, while the Athenians alleged that when, before the\r\ndays of slavery, their children went to draw water at the Nine-Springs\r\n(Ἐννεάκρουνοι), the Pelasgians of the district insulted them. What more\r\nlikely than that, when the Hellenic part of the population was coercing\r\nthe other portion of it into servitude, their resentment should\r\noccasionally find vent in rustic insolence to boys and maidens?\r\n\r\nThe doctrine thus propagated by Herodotus concerning Attica is even\r\nmore strongly represented in Strabo as respects its Ionian character.\r\nΤὴν μὲν Ἰάδα τῇ παλαίᾳ Ἀτθίδι τὴν αὐτὴν φαμέν· καὶ γὰρ Ἴωνες ἐκαλοῦντο\r\nοἱ τότε Ἀττικοὶ, καὶ ἐκεῖθεν εἰσιν οἱ τὴν Ἀσίαν ἐποικήσαντες Ἴωνες,\r\nκαὶ χρησάμενοι τῇ νῦν λεγομένῃ γλώττῃ Ἰάδι[228]. The poverty of their\r\nsoil kept them, he adds, apart as of a different race (ἔθνος), and of a\r\ndifferent speech (γλώττη).\r\n\r\nAnd thus again Herodotus reports that the same letter which the Dorians\r\ncalled San, the Ionians called Sigma. Is not this more than a dialectic\r\ndifference, and does it not indicate a deeper distinction of race?[229]\r\n\r\nThe connection of the Pelasgians with ancient Attica will receive\r\nfurther illustration from our inquiry hereafter into the general\r\nevidence of the later tradition respecting that race.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Egypt._\r\n\r\n_Egypt and the Pelasgians._\r\n\r\nIf we are to venture yet one step further back, and ask to what\r\nextraneous race and country do the Pelasgic ages of Greece appear\r\nparticularly to refer us as their type, the answer, as it would seem,\r\nthough it can only be given with reserve, must be, that Egypt and its\r\npeople appear most nearly to supply the pattern. A variety of notes,\r\nindicative of affinity, are traceable at a variety of points where we\r\nfind reason to suspect a Pelasgian character: particularly in Troy,\r\nand in the early Roman history, more or less in Hesiod and his school,\r\nand in certain parts of Greece. Many of these notes, and likewise the\r\ngeneral character that they indicate, appear to belong to Egypt also.\r\n\r\nThe direct signs of connection between Egypt and Greece are far less\r\npalpable in Homer, than between Greece and Phœnicia. We have no account\r\nfrom him of Egyptians settled among the Greeks, or of Greeks among\r\nthe Egyptians. The evidence of a trading intercourse between the two\r\ncountries is confined to the case of the pseudo-Ulysses, who ventures\r\nthither from Crete under circumstances[230] which seem to show that\r\nit was hardly within the ordinary circle of Greek communications.\r\nHe arrives indeed in five days, by the aid of a steady north-west\r\nwind: but a voyage of five days[231] across the open sea, which\r\nmight be indefinitely prolonged by variation or want of wind, was\r\nhighly formidable to a people whose only safety during their maritime\r\nenterprises lay in the power of hauling up their vessels whenever\r\nneedful upon a beach. It was near twice the length of the voyage\r\nto Troy[232]. Hence we find that Menelaus was carried to Egypt not\r\nvoluntarily, but by stress of weather: and Nestor speaks with horror of\r\nhis crossing such an expanse, a passage that even the birds make but\r\nonce a year[233]. If this be deemed inconsistent with the five days’\r\npassage, yet even inconsistency on this point in Homer would be a proof\r\nthat the voyage to Egypt was in his time rare, strange, and mysterious\r\nto his countrymen, and so was dealt with freely by him as lying beyond\r\nexperience and measurement.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in Homer absolutely to contradict the opinion that\r\nDanaus was Egyptian; but neither is there anything which suffices\r\nconclusively to establish it. And if he considered the Egyptians to\r\napproach to the Pelasgian type, this may cast some slight doubt on\r\nthe Egyptian origin of Danaus. The Poet certainly would not choose a\r\nPelasgian name, unless fully naturalized, for one of the characteristic\r\nnational designations of the Achæans. But he is too good a Greek to\r\ngive us particular information about any foreign eminence within his\r\nfatherland. It seems, however, possible that in the name ἀπίη, given\r\nto Peloponnesus, there may lie a relation to the Egyptian Apis. Apis\r\nwas the first of the four divine bulls of Egypt[234]; and the ox was\r\nthe symbol of agriculture which, according to the tradition conveyed by\r\nÆschylus[235], Danaus introduced into the Peloponnesus.\r\n\r\nThe paucity of intercourse however between Greece and Egypt in the time\r\nof Homer does not put a negative on the supposition that there may have\r\nbeen early migration from the latter country to the former.\r\n\r\nIt has been questioned how far the ancient Egyptians were conversant\r\nwith the art of navigation. The affirmative is fully argued by Mr.\r\nM’Culloch[236] in his commentaries on Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations.\r\nBut it is plain that the Egyptians were not known to Homer as a\r\nnautical people. Not only do we never on any occasion hear of them\r\nin connection with the use of ships, but we hear of the plunder of\r\ntheir coast by pirates, when they confined themselves to resistance by\r\nland. This want of nautical genius agrees with all that we learn of\r\nthem in Holy Scripture. And it places them in marked resemblance to\r\nthe Pelasgian races generally: to the Arcadians[237]; to the Trojans;\r\nto the early Romans, who paid no serious attention to the creation of\r\na fleet until the second Samnite War B.C. 311, or, as Niebuhr thinks,\r\nthen only first had a fleet at all[238]: and again, to the landsmanlike\r\nspirit of Hesiod, who calls himself\r\n\r\n    οὔτε τι ναυτιλίης σεσοφισμένος, οὔτε τι νηῶν,\r\n\r\nlimits it entirely to a certain season, never was at sea except\r\ncrossing from Aulis to Eubœa, and considers the whole business of going\r\nto sea one that had better be avoided[239].\r\n\r\nThat with Homer the fabulous element enters into his view of the\r\nEgyptians seems plain, from his calling them the race of Paieon, in the\r\nsame way as he calls the Phæacians the race of Neptune: and in some\r\ndegree also from the place which he gives them in the wanderings of\r\nMenelaus, since they lay, like those of Ulysses, in the exterior and\r\nunascertained sphere of geography.\r\n\r\nProteus is called Αἰγύπτιος, but in all probability the meaning\r\nis Proteus of the Nile, which is the proper Αἴγυπτος in the\r\nmasculine gender; while the country, derivatively called from it\r\nas the γῆ Αἴγυπτος, takes the feminine. We shall hereafter see how\r\nProteus belongs to the circle of nautical and therefore Phœnician\r\ntradition[240]. That deity has upon him all the marks of the outer\r\nand non-Grecian world. He is no less an admirable type of the πρωκτής,\r\nthan a regular servant of Neptune, Ποσειδάωνος ὑποδμώς (Od. iv. 386).\r\nThis connection with Neptune by no means makes him Greek: Neptune was\r\nthe god of the θάλασσα, which extended beyond the circle of Greek\r\nexperience, even to the borders of Ocean. We see set upon the whole of\r\nthis adventure the same singular religious token as upon the remote\r\nadventures of Ulysses, namely this, that Menelaus passes beyond the\r\nordinary charge of the Hellenic deities. The means of deliverance\r\nare pointed out to him, not by Minerva, but by Eidothea, daughter of\r\nProteus himself, whose name, function, and relationship alike remind\r\nus that it was Ino Leucothea, daughter of the Phœnician Cadmus,\r\nwho appeared to Ulysses for his deliverance, in a nearly similar\r\nborder-zone of the marine territory lying between the world of fable\r\nand the world of experience; for the position of Egypt was in this\r\nrespect like that of Phæacia. It would seem, then, as if Homer himself\r\nknew Egypt mainly through a Phœnician medium.\r\n\r\nOf the Phœnician intercourse with that country we may safely rest\r\nassured, from their proximity, from their resort thither mentioned in\r\nHomer[241], and from the traces they left in Egypt itself.\r\n\r\nIt seems a probable conjecture that they had from a very early date a\r\ncolony or factory in Egypt, by which they carried on their commerce\r\nwith it. In the time of Herodotus, there was at Memphis a large and\r\nwell-cared-for τέμενος or demesne of Proteus, whom the priests reported\r\nto be the successor of Sesostris on the Egyptian throne. This demesne\r\nwas surrounded by the habitations of the ‘Tyrian Phœnices,’ and the\r\nwhole plain in which it stood was called the Τυρίων στρατόπεδον.\r\nThere is another tradition in Herodotus, according to which the\r\nPhœnicians furnished Egypt with the fleet, which in the time of Necho\r\ncircumnavigated Africa[242].\r\n\r\nHomer affords us little or no direct evidence of a connection between\r\nthe religion of Greece and an Egyptian origin, to which Herodotus\r\nconceived it to be referable; but yet it may very well be the case,\r\nthat Egypt was the fountain-head of many traditions which were carried\r\nby the Phœnicians into Greece. In Homer, for example, we find marks\r\nthat seem to connect Dionysus with Phœnicia: but the Phœnicians\r\nmay have become acquainted with him in Egypt, where Diodorus[243]\r\nreports that Osiris was held to be his original. There are two marks,\r\nhowever, of Egyptian influence, which seem to be more deeply traced.\r\nOne is the extraordinary sacredness attached to the oxen of the Sun.\r\nThe other, the apparent relation between the Egyptian Neith and the\r\nAthene of Attica, taken in conjunction with the Pelasgian character\r\nof the district[244]. But certainly our positive information from\r\nHomer respecting the Egyptians may be summed up in very brief compass.\r\nThey would appear to have been peaceful, rich, and prosperous: highly\r\nskilled in agriculture, and also in medicine, if we are not rather\r\nto understand by this that they knew the use of opium, which might\r\nreadily draw fervid eulogiums from a race not instructed in its\r\nproperties. But the testimony to their agricultural excellence cannot\r\nbe mistaken. Twice their fields are mentioned, and both times as\r\nπερικάλλεες ἀγροί: in exact correspondence with the tradition which we\r\nfind subsisting in Attica respecting those fields which were tilled by\r\nthe Pelasgians[245]. And this case of the Egyptians is the only one\r\nthroughout the Poems in which Homer bestows commendation upon tillage.\r\nAgain, they fought bravely when attacked[246]. We find also the name\r\nÆgyptius naturalized in Ithaca. Lastly, they appear to have been\r\nhospitable to strangers, and placable to enemies[247]. This is a faint\r\noutline: but all its features appear to be in harmony with those of the\r\nPelasgian race.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark, that the Lotophagi visited by Ulysses\r\ncorrespond very much with the Egyptians, such as Homer conceived them.\r\nLocally, they belonged to the Egyptian quarter of the globe: they\r\nreceived the companions of Ulysses with kindness[248]; and they gave\r\nthem to eat of the lotus, which appears in its essential and remarkable\r\nproperties exactly to correspond with the νήπενθες[249] that Helen\r\nhad obtained from Egypt. As every figure of the Phœnician traditions,\r\nexcept perhaps Æolus, is essentially either hard, or cruel, or\r\ndeceitful, even so, whether on account of neighbourhood or otherwise,\r\nit seems to have been the poet’s intention to impress the less\r\nenergetic but more kindly character of the Egyptians on this particular\r\npeople, which perhaps he conceived to be allied to them.\r\n\r\nThere is indeed one suggestive passage of the Odyssey from which it is\r\nopen to us to conjecture that there was more of substantive relation\r\nbetween Greece and Egypt than Homer’s purpose as a national poet led\r\nhim fully to disclose. Menelaus, when he returns to Egypt after hearing\r\nfrom Proteus of the death of Agamemnon, raises in Egypt a mound in\r\nhonour of his brother[250], ἵν’ ἄσβεστον κλέος εἴη. But this mound\r\ncould not contribute to the glory of the slain king, unless Greece and\r\nits inhabitants were tolerably well known in Egypt.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, the evidence of the Homeric poems does not correspond\r\nwith those later traditions which refer principally to Egypt as the\r\norigin of what is Greek. In considering this subject, we ought indeed\r\nto bear in mind Homer’s systematic silence as to the channels by\r\nwhich foreign influences found their way into Greece. For it throws\r\nus entirely upon such indirect evidence as he may (so to speak)\r\ninvoluntarily afford. And we must also recollect firstly that the\r\nEgyptian influence, whatever it may have been, may perhaps have\r\noperated more in the Pelasgian period, than in that Achæan age to which\r\nthe representations of Homer belong. Secondly, that much may have\r\nreached Greece, as to religion or otherwise, in a Phœnician dress,\r\nwhich the Phœnicians themselves may have derived from Egypt.\r\n\r\nThere are other features, well known from all history to be Egyptian,\r\nthough not traced for them by the hand of Homer, which tend strongly\r\nto confirm their relationship to the Pelasgian race, partly as it is\r\ndelineated in the Homeric outlines, and partly as it is known from\r\nlater tradition. One of these points is the comparatively hard and\r\nunimaginative character of its mythology, conforming to that of the\r\nrace. It is interesting to notice how the Greeks, with their fine sense\r\nof beauty, got rid at once, in whatever they derived from Egypt, of the\r\nmythological deformities of gods incarnate in beasts, and threw them\r\ninto the shapes of more graceful fable.\r\n\r\nA second point of Pelasgian resemblance is the strong ritual and\r\nsacerdotal development of religion. A third is the want of the\r\npolitical energies which build and maintain extensive Empire. With\r\nall its wealth, and its early civilization, this opulent state could\r\nnever make acquisitions beyond its own border, and has usually been\r\nin subordination to some more masculine Power. A fourth is, the early\r\nuse of solid masonry in public edifices. The remains in Greece and\r\nItaly which are referred to the Pelasgians are indeed of much smaller\r\ndimensions than those of Egypt: but the Pelasgians of these countries,\r\nso far as we know, had not time to attain any higher political\r\norganization than that of small communities, with comparatively\r\ncontracted means of commanding labour. A fifth is their wealth itself,\r\nwhich causes Egyptian Thebes to be celebrated both in the Iliad and in\r\nthe Odyssey, perhaps the only case in which the poet has thus repeated\r\nhimself, Il. ix. 381, and Od. iv. 126.\r\n\r\nLastly, the reputed derivation of the oracle at Dodona from Egypt\r\nharmonises with the Pelasgian character assigned to that seat\r\nof worship by Homer. The tradition to this effect reported by\r\nHerodotus[251] was Greek, and not Egyptian: it was obtained by him on\r\nthe spot: and if Homer’s countrymen partook of the poet’s reserve,\r\nand his dislike of assigning a foreign source to anything established\r\nin Greece, a presumption arises that this particular statement would\r\nnot have been made, had it not rested on a respectable course of\r\ntraditionary authority.\r\n\r\n_Silence of the Iliad._\r\n\r\nIt may however be asked, if the Pelasgians are to be regarded as\r\nGreeks, and as the base of the Greek nation, and if Homer was familiar\r\nwith their name and position in that character, how happens it that he\r\nnever calls the Greeks Pelasgians, as he calls them Danaans, Argeians,\r\nand Achæans, and never even gives us in the Iliad a Pelasgian race or\r\ntribe by name as numbered among the Greeks?\r\n\r\nNow it is not a sufficient answer to say, that the Pelasgian race and\r\nname were falling under eclipse in the age of Homer; for we shall\r\nsee reason hereafter to suppose that the appellations of Danaan and\r\nArgeian were likewise (so to speak) preterite, though not yet obsolete,\r\nappellations; still Homer employs them freely.\r\n\r\nTheir case is essentially different, however, as we shall find, from\r\nthat of the Pelasgians, since those two names do not imply either any\r\nblood different from that of the Achæan or properly Greek body, or any\r\nparticular race which had supplied an element in its composition: one\r\nof these the Pelasgian name certainly does imply. Those names too,\r\nwithout doubt, would not be used, unless they shed glory on the Greeks:\r\nthe Pelasgian name could have no such treasure to dispense.\r\n\r\nIt should, however, here be observed, that an examination presently\r\nto be made of the force of the Argeian name will help us to account\r\nfor the disappearance from Greece of the Pelasgian name, which it may\r\nperhaps have supplanted.\r\n\r\nLet me observe, that if the Pelasgians did, in point of fact, supply\r\nan element to the Greek nationality, which had, while still remaining\r\nperceptibly distinct, become politically subordinate in Homer’s time,\r\nthat is precisely the case in which he would be sure not to apply the\r\nname to the Greeks at large, nor to any Greek state, as its application\r\ncould not under such circumstances be popular. His non-employment of\r\nit, therefore, for Greeks is _pro tanto_ a confirmation to the general\r\nargument of these pages.\r\n\r\nIf, again, there were a distinct people of Pelasgians among the Trojan\r\nauxiliaries, and on the Greek side a large but subordinate Pelasgic\r\nelement, this would be ample reason both for his naming the Pelasgic\r\nallies of the Trojans, with a view to the truth of his recital, and for\r\nhis not using the Pelasgic name in connection with the Greeks; for in\r\nno instance has he placed branches of the same race or tribe on both\r\nsides in the struggle. Glaucus and Sarpedon, the transplanted Æolids,\r\ncannot be considered as exceptions, first, from the old date of their\r\nGreek extraction: and secondly, because they are individuals, whereas\r\nwe now speak of tribes and races. The name, too, was more suited to the\r\nunmixed Pelasgians of the Trojan alliance, than to a people, among whom\r\nit had grown pale beneath the greater splendour of famous dynasties and\r\nof more energetic tribes.\r\n\r\nThe application of this reasoning to the Pelasgi is fortified by its\r\nbeing applicable to other Homeric names.\r\n\r\n_Thraces and Threicii._\r\n\r\nIt can hardly be doubted that the name Θρῇξ is akin to Τραχὶν and\r\nτρῆχυς[252], that it means a highlander, or inhabitant of a rough\r\nand mountainous country, and that it included the inhabitants of\r\nterritories clearly Greek. This extended signification of the term\r\nexplains the assertion of Herodotus[253], that the Thracians were the\r\nmost numerous of all nations, after the Indians.\r\n\r\nNow Homer makes Thamyris the Bard a Thracian; yet it is clear from his\r\nhaving to do with the Muses, and from the geographical points with\r\nwhich Homer connects his name, that he must be a Greek[254]. They\r\nare, Δώριον in the dominions of Pylos, where he met his calamity, and\r\nthe Œchalia of Eurytus in Thessaly, from whence he was making his\r\njourney[255]. Strabo tells us that Pieria and Olympus were anciently\r\nThracian[256], and moreover, that the Thracians of Bœotia consecrated\r\nHelicon to the Muses. Orpheus, Musæus, Eumolpus, were held to be\r\nThracians by tradition, yet it also made them write in Greek. I think\r\nwe may trace this descriptive character of the name Θρῇκες, and its not\r\nyet having acquired fully the force of a proper name with Homer, in his\r\nemployment of it as an adjective, and not a substantive. It is very\r\nfrequently joined in the poems with the affix ἄνδρες, which he does\r\nnot employ with such proper names as are in familiar and established\r\nuse, such as Danaan, Argive, or Achæan. He says Achæan or Danaan\r\nheroes, but never joins the names to the simple predicate ‘men.’ When\r\nhe says Ἀχαιὸς ἄνηρ, it is with a different force; it is in pointing\r\nout an individual among a multitude. Indeed in Homer it is not Θρῇξ but\r\nΘρηίκιος which means Thracian, of or belonging to the country called\r\nThrace, Θρῄκη. There is then sufficient evidence that Greeks of the\r\nhighlands might be Thraces; and there may very probably have been whole\r\ntribes so called among the Greeks. Yet we never have Thracians named\r\nby Homer on the Greek side, while on the Trojan side they appear as\r\nsupplying no less than two contingents of allies: one in the Catalogue,\r\nand another which had just arrived at the period of the Δολώνεια[257].\r\n\r\nThese two appear to be entirely distinct tribes: because no connection\r\nis mentioned between them; because the first contingent is described\r\nas being composed not of all the Thracians, but of all the Thracians\r\nwithin the Hellespont: and lastly, because the new comers have their\r\nown βασιλεὺς with them, as the first contingent had its leaders,\r\nAcamas and Peirous. The Hellespont meant here seems to be the strait,\r\nbecause it is ἀγαρρόος. And it is therefore possible, that while the\r\nfirst contingent was supplied by the nearer tribes, the second may have\r\nbeen composed of those Thracians who lay nearer the Greek border.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that Mars, who is so inseparably associated with\r\nThrace, fights on the Trojan side, we have no evidence from Homer which\r\nwould warrant the assumption that he intended to connect the Thracians\r\nmore intimately with the Pelasgians than with the Hellenes. It may be\r\nthat the poet’s ethnical knowledge failed him. The wavering of Mars\r\nseems to indicate a corresponding uncertainty in his own mind. Perhaps\r\nwith both the Thracian and Pelasgian names it was the breadth of their\r\nrange that constituted the difficulty. Some part of Thrace is with him\r\nἐριβώλαξ[258]; it is the part from which the first contingent came, as\r\nthe son of Peirous belonged to it. And that part is less mountainous\r\nthan the quarter which I have presumed may have supplied the contingent\r\nof Rhesus. The epithet is the very same as is applied to the Pelasgian\r\nLarissa[259]: and the Larissan Pelasgians are placed next to the first\r\nThracian contingent in the Trojan Catalogue.\r\n\r\nThe most probable supposition for Thracians as well as Pelasgians\r\nis, that they had affinities in both directions; that they existed\r\namong the Greeks diffusively, and were absorbed in names of greater\r\nsplendour: but that on the Trojan side they still had distinct national\r\nexistence, and therefore they are named on that side, while to avoid\r\nconfusion silence is studiously maintained about them on the other.\r\nThe whole race, says Grote, present a character more Asiatic than\r\nEuropean[260].\r\n\r\n_Caucones and Leleges._\r\n\r\nMany other races have been recorded in the later traditions as having\r\nin pre-historic times inhabited various parts of Greece. Such are\r\nTemnices, Aones, Hyantes, Teleboi. Of these Homer makes no mention.\r\nBut there are two other races whom he names, the Leleges and Caucones,\r\nand with respect to whom Strabo[261] has affirmed, that they were\r\nextensively diffused over Greece as well as over Asia Minor.\r\n\r\nHomer has proceeded, with respect to the Caucones, exactly in the same\r\nway as with respect to the Pelasgi. In the Iliad he names them[262]\r\namong the Trojan allies, and is wholly silent about them in dealing\r\nwith the Greek races. But in the Odyssey, where he had no national\r\ndistinctions to keep in view, he names them as a people apparently\r\nGreek, and dwelling on the western side of Greece. The pseudo-Mentor is\r\ngoing among them on business, to obtain payment of a debt[263]: and the\r\nmanner in which they are mentioned, without explanation, shows that the\r\nname must have been familiar to Nestor and the other persons addressed.\r\nProbably therefore they were a neighbouring tribe: certainly a Greek\r\ntribe, for we do not find proof that the Homeric Greeks carried on\r\ncommerce except with their own race.\r\n\r\nThe poet names them with a laudatory epithet: they are the Καύκωνες\r\nμεγάθυμοι. This may remind us of his bounty in the same kind to the\r\nPelasgians: and it seems as though he had had a reverence for the\r\nremains of the ancient possessors of the country.\r\n\r\nWe have abundant signs of the Leleges on the Trojan side in the war.\r\nIn the Tenth Book they appear as a contingent: but besides this,\r\nPriam had for one of his wives Laothee, daughter of Altes, king of\r\nthe Lelegians, who are here called φιλοπτόλεμοι[264]. What is more\r\nimportant, we find the expressions Λέλεγες καὶ Τρῶες[265] used together\r\nin such a way, as implies the wide extension of the former as a race.\r\nIn the Twentieth Iliad, Æneas in speaking of Achilles refers to his\r\nformer escape from the great warrior. He fought, says Æneas, under\r\nthe auspices of Minerva: who shed light before him, and bid him slay\r\nLelegians and Trojans,\r\n\r\n                                ἠδ’ ἐκέλευεν\r\n    ἔγχεï χαλκείῳ Λέλεγας καὶ Τρῶας ἐναίρειν.\r\n\r\nThe Trojan force was in two main portions, each with many subdivisions:\r\nfirst, the army of Priam, with those of his kindred or subordinate\r\nprinces: and, secondly, the allies, with their numerous and widely\r\ndispersed races. In the passage just quoted, the word _Leleges_ must\r\neither mean the great body of allies, or else it must, conjointly with\r\n_Troes_, signify the whole mass of what we may call the indigenous\r\ntroops. Now the former is highly improbable. Such differences as are\r\nimplied in the combination of Thracians, Lycians, and Pelasgians, could\r\nnot well be, and nowhere else are comprehended by Homer under a single\r\nname as one race or nation, though the Lycians, on account of their\r\nexcellence, are sometimes[266] taken to represent the whole body of\r\nthe allies. And again, if the Leleges meant the whole body of allies,\r\nthe Pelasgians would appear as a branch of them, which is contrary to\r\nall evidence and likelihood. If then the two words together represent\r\nthose indigenous troops, as contradistinguished from the allies, who\r\nwere arrayed in the five divisions that are enumerated in vv. 816-39 of\r\nthe Second book, the question is, how is the sense to be distributed\r\nbetween them. And here there is not much room for doubt. The name Τρῶες\r\nhad been assumed four generations before the war from King Tros, and\r\nwas therefore a political or dynastic name, not a name of race. It most\r\nprobably therefore indicates either the inhabitants of Priam’s own\r\ncity and immediate dominions, or else the ruling race, who held power\r\nhere, as elsewhere, among a subject population. In either case we must\r\nconclude that the word Leleges is meant to indicate the blood, and also\r\nthe blood-name (so to speak) of the bulk of the population through a\r\nconsiderable tract of country: and it will be observed that in the\r\nfourth and fifth of the divisions[267] in the Trojan Catalogue Homer\r\nspecifies no blood-name or name of race whatever.\r\n\r\nThis being so, we find an important light cast upon the meaning of\r\nthe word Leleges. As we proceed with these inquiries, we shall find\r\naccumulating evidence of the Pelasgianism of the mass of the population\r\non the Trojan side: and thus when it appears that that mass or a very\r\ngreat part of it was Lelegian, it also appears probable that the\r\nLeleges were at least akin to the Pelasgians, though some have taken\r\nthem to be distinct[268].\r\n\r\nIn answer therefore to the question, who were these Caucones and these\r\nLeleges, while we are deficient in the means of detailed and particular\r\nreply, we may, I think, fall back with tolerable security upon the\r\nwords used by Bishop Thirlwall in closing an ethnological survey:\r\n\r\n“The review we have just taken of the Pelasgian settlements in Greece\r\nappears inevitably to lead to the conclusion that the name Pelasgians\r\nwas a general one, like that of Saxons, Franks, or Alemanni: but that\r\neach of the Pelasgian tribes had also one peculiar to itself[269].”\r\n\r\nUpon our finding, as we find, the Pelasgian name in certain apparent\r\nrelations with others, such as Leleges and Caucones, it appears more\r\nreasonable to presume a relationship between them, than the reverse:\r\nfor nothing can be more improbable than the simultaneous presence at\r\nthat early period of a multitude of races, radically distinct from each\r\nother, and yet diffused intermixedly over the same country upon equal\r\nterms, and if there was a relationship, it would most probably be that\r\nof subdivision, under which Leleges and Caucones might be branches of\r\nthe widely spread Pelasgian family.\r\n\r\nThis opinion is supported, not only by presumptions, but by much\r\nindirect evidence. It is indisputable that various names were applied,\r\nby the custom of the Homeric age, to the same people, and at the\r\nsame period. The poet calls the inhabitants of Elis both Elians and\r\nEpeans. The people of Ithaca are Ithacesians (Ἰθακήσιοι), but there\r\nare also Ἀχαιοί[270], and in the Catalogue they are included under\r\nthe Cephallenians[271]. The Dolopians in the speech of Phœnix[272]\r\nare included under the Phthians; and are also within the scope of the\r\nother names applied by the Catalogue to the followers of Achilles, who\r\nwere called by the name of Myrmidons, or of Hellens, or of Achæans. Of\r\nthese the first seems to be the denomination, which the ruling race\r\nof that particular district had brought with it into the country. The\r\nthird probably belongs to the Myrmidons, as members of that tribe, of\r\nHellic origin, which at the time predominated in Greece generally.\r\nThe second, as we shall find, was the common name for all Greek tribes\r\nof that origin, and was the name which ultimately gained a complete\r\nascendancy in the country. Of the five nations of Crete in the\r\nSeventeenth Odyssey[273], either all or several are probably included\r\nin the Κρῆτες of the Second Iliad[274]. Nay, we may now declare it\r\nto be at least highly probable[275], that the Ionian name was a\r\nsub-designation of the Pelasgians. Thus we have abundant instances of\r\nplurality in the designations of tribes. On the whole, we shall do best\r\nto assume that the names in question of Leleges and Caucones indicated\r\nPelasgian subdivision. The inquiry is, however, one of ethnical\r\nantiquarianism only; these names are historically insignificant, for,\r\napart from the Pelasgian, they carry no distinctive character or\r\nspecial function in reference to Greece.\r\n\r\n  _Erratum._--I have inadvertently, in p. 103, rendered κητώεσσαν ‘full\r\n  of wild beasts.’ It ought to have been translated ‘deep-sunken.’ See\r\n  Buttmann’s Lexilogus, _in voc._\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[126] Il. ii. 681-5.\r\n\r\n[127] Hermann Gr.

III.\r\n\r\n_Pelasgians continued: and certain States naturalised or akin to\r\nGreece._\r\n\r\n_a._ Crete. _b._ Lycia. _c._ Cyprus.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Crete and the traditions of Minos._\r\n\r\nThis appears to be the place for a more full consideration of the\r\ntestimony of Homer with respect to, probably, the greatest character\r\nof early Greek history, and one who cannot be omitted in any inquiry\r\nconcerning the early Pelasgians of Greece: in as much as they stand in\r\na direct Homeric relation to Crete, of which he was the king.\r\n\r\nIn the poems of Homer, Minos appears to stand forth as the first great\r\nand fixed point of Greek nationality and civilization. He is not indeed\r\nso remote from the period of Homer himself as others, even as other\r\nEuropeans, whom the poet mentions, and whom he connects by genealogy\r\nwith the Trojan period, particularly the Æolids. But the peculiarities\r\nmeeting in his case, as compared with most of them, are these:\r\n\r\n1. That he is expressly traced upwards as well as downwards.\r\n\r\n2. That he is connected with a fixed place as its sovereign.\r\n\r\n3. That so much is either recounted or suggested of his character and\r\nacts.\r\n\r\n4. That the Homeric traditions as to Minos are so remarkably supported\r\nfrom without.\r\n\r\nMinos is mentioned, and somewhat largely, in no less than six different\r\npassages of the Iliad and Odyssey. Homer has given us a much fuller\r\nidea of him, than of the more popular hero Hercules, although he is not\r\nnamed in nearly so many passages; and it is singular, that the more\r\nancient of the two personages is also by much the more historical.\r\nAgain, the poet has told us more about Minos, although he is of foreign\r\nextraction, than he has said about all the rest of the older Greek\r\nheroes put together. Of Theseus, Pirithous, Castor, Pollux, Meleager,\r\nPerseus, Jason, and the rest, his notices are very few and meagre.\r\nIn dealing with Homer, I should quote even this fact of the greater\r\namount of his references, which in the case of most other poets would\r\nbe immaterial, as a strong presumption of the superior historical\r\nimportance of the person concerned.\r\n\r\nMinos, according to Homer, had Jupiter for his father, a Phœnician\r\ndamsel for his mother, and Rhadamanthus for his younger brother.\r\nThe name[276] of his mother is not recorded, but Jupiter calls her\r\nfar-famed. This fame, if due to her beauty, would probably have kept\r\nher name alive; but as it has not been preserved, it is more probably a\r\nreflection from the subsequent greatness of her son.\r\n\r\nThe story thus far appears probably to indicate that Minos was a\r\nPhœnician by birth, but without a known ancestry, and raised into\r\ncelebrity by his own energies and achievements.\r\n\r\nThe mode, by which he rose to fame, was by the government of men and\r\nthe foundation of civil institutions. At nine years old he received,\r\nsuch is the legend, revelations from Jupiter,[277] and reigned, in\r\nthe great or mighty city (μεγάλη πόλις) of Cnossus, over Crete: such\r\nwas the form, copied by the politic legislator of Rome, in which a\r\ntitle to veneration was secured for his laws. No other city, besides\r\nthis capital, is described in Homer by the epithet μεγάλη, or by any\r\nequivalent word.\r\n\r\nA further vivid mark of his political greatness is afforded us by that\r\npassage in the Odyssey, which exhibits him not simply as exercising\r\nin the world beneath[278] the mere office of a judge, but rather as\r\ndischarging there a judicial function in virtue of his sovereignty.\r\nSuch is the force of the word θεμιστεύειν,[279] which signifies rather\r\nto give law than to administer it: or, at least, to exercise the\r\nfunction of a king rather than of a judge[280] (ἵστωρ). He is described\r\nas still the illustrious son of Jupiter, Διὸς ἀγλαὸς υἱός. Even there\r\nhe appears not as one of the suffering or bewildered inhabitants of\r\nthat lower world, but in the exercise of power as an actual ruler among\r\nthe spirits of the departed;\r\n\r\n    οἱ δέ μιν ἀμφὶ δίκας εἴροντο ἄνακτα.\r\n\r\nHe only is invested with any character of this kind. Every other\r\napparition below is either in actual suffering, or gloomy and depressed.\r\n\r\nThe epithet ὀλοόφρων, applied to Minos in an earlier passage of the\r\nΝεκυία, might perhaps convey the same idea as Virgil has rendered by\r\nhis _durissima_ regna,[281] in the description of Rhadamanthus: and we\r\nmay also compare the address of Menelaus in the Third Iliad to Jupiter,\r\n\r\n    Ζεῦ πάτερ οὔτις σεῖο θεῶν ὀλοώτερος ἄλλος.[282]\r\n\r\nA reasonable construction would refer the word to the commercial\r\ncharacter of the Phœnician people, at once cunning and daring[283]; and\r\nthere is much probability in the opinion of Höck, who interprets the\r\nword as meaning ‘exactor of tribute,’ or as alluding to the exaction by\r\nMinos of a tribute from Attica[284]. On this we shall shortly have to\r\nenlarge.\r\n\r\n_Power of Crete._\r\n\r\nAs to the family and kingdom of Minos, we should gather in the first\r\nplace from Homer, that Crete had under him been preeminent in power. He\r\nwas king of the island (Κρήτῃ ἐπίουρος)[285], and he reigned, at the\r\nage of nine years only (ἐννέωρος βασίλευε), in Cnossus over the five\r\nnations. The island had ninety, or in the rounder numbers, an hundred\r\ncities. Two generations had passed since Minos; Idomeneus his grandson\r\ndid not apparently reign, like Minos himself, over the whole of it:\r\nfor if this had been the case, it is very improbable, presuming that\r\nwe may judge by the analogies which the order of the army in general\r\nsupplies, that Meriones would have been made his associate, which\r\nin some manner he is, in the command; and again, the feigned story\r\nof Ulysses in the Odyssey, though it introduces Idomeneus, does not\r\nrepresent him as king of the whole island, but rather implies that his\r\npretended brother, Æthon, also exercised a sovereignty there[286]. But\r\neven then the Cretan contingent, although the towns named as supplying\r\nit do not extend over the whole island[287], amounted to eighty ships,\r\nand thus exceeded any other, except those of Agamemnon and of Nestor.\r\nAnd then, when Minos had so long been dead, it was still the marked and\r\nspecial distinction of the country, that it was the seat of his race.\r\nSo Eumæus, describing the disguised stranger to Penelope, says[288],\r\n\r\n    φησὶ δ’ Ὀδυσσῆος ξεῖνος πατρώïος εἶναι,\r\n    Κρήτῃ ναιετάων, ὅθι Μίνωος γένος ἐστίν.\r\n\r\nA passage which perhaps testifies that the family of Minos had been\r\nξεῖνοι to the predecessors of Ulysses.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps there is no country in Greece which Homer so rarely\r\nmentions without a laudatory epithet. Though (περίρρυτος) sea-girt,\r\nit is not with him an island: it is Κρήτη γαῖα, Κρήτη εὐρεῖα, Κρήτη\r\nἑκατόμπολις[289], and in the principal description, Homer exalts it\r\nmore highly, I think, than any other territory,\r\n\r\n    Κρήτη τις γαῖ’ ἐστὶ, μέσῳ ἐνὶ οἴνοπι πόντῳ\r\n    καλὴ καὶ πίειρα, περίρρυτος· ἐν δ’ ἄνθρωποι\r\n    πολλοὶ, ἀπειέσιοι, καὶ ἐννήκοντα πόληες[290].\r\n\r\nIf it should be thought that the evidence to the character of Minos as\r\na lawgiver is slight, we must call to mind that even the word _law_\r\nis not found in Homer. The term afterwards used by the Greeks to\r\nexpress what we mean by a law, νόμος, only occurs with Homer in a sense\r\nquite different. He tells us of nothing more determinate than δίκαι\r\nand θέμιστες. But relatively to his pictures of other governors, the\r\nlegislatorial character of Minos is as strongly marked as that of Numa\r\nis in Livy, relatively to other kings of Rome.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, as to the region of Crete, it was inhabited by five\r\nraces: namely,\r\n\r\n  1. Ἀχαιοί.\r\n  2. Ἐτεοκρῆτες.\r\n  3. Κυδῶνες.\r\n  4. Δωριέες.\r\n  5. Πελάσγοι.\r\n\r\n_Pelasgianism in Crete._\r\n\r\nOf these the Achæans and Dorians are evidently Greek. We are now\r\nexamining at large the title of the Pelasgi to the same character. With\r\nrespect to the Cydones, we may draw an inference from the facts, that\r\nthey lived (Od. iii. 292), on a Cretan river Iardanus, and that this\r\nwas also the name of a river of Peloponnesus (Il. vii. 133). I should\r\neven hold that this stream, which is not identified, was most probably\r\nin Arcadia: first, because in the contest with the Hellic tribes of\r\nPylos, the Arcadians as Pelasgians would be on the defensive, and would\r\ntherefore fight on their own ground: secondly, because the battle was\r\non the ὠκύροος Κελάδων. These words are most suitable to some mountain\r\nfeeder of the Iardanus, with its precipitate descent, rather than to\r\nthe usually more peaceful course of a river near the sea, especially\r\nnear the sea coast of sandy Pylus, which reached to the Alpheus[291].\r\nThis supposition respecting the Celadon will also best account for\r\nwhat otherwise seems singular; namely, that the battle was at once on\r\nthe Celadon, and also about the Iardanus (Ἰαρδάνου ἀμφὶ ῥεέθρα[292]).\r\nAgain, the battle was between Arcadians and Pylians, and therefore,\r\nfrom the relative situation of the territories, was probably on some\r\nArcadian feeder of the Alpheus, lying far inland. Now if Iardanus was\r\nan Arcadian river, and if the Arcadians were Pelasgi, it leads to a\r\npresumption that the Cydonians of Crete, who dwelt upon an Iardanus,\r\nwere Pelasgian also.\r\n\r\nThere remain the Ἐτεοκρῆτες, apparently so called, to distinguish them\r\nas indigenous from all the other four nations, who were ἐπήλυδες, or\r\nimmigrant. This is curious, because it refers us elsewhere for the\r\norigin of the Pelasgi. It is the only case in which we hear of any\r\nthing anterior to them, upon the soils which they occupied. Lastly,\r\nCrete lay between Greece and Cyprus, and Cyprus is clearly indicated\r\nin the Odyssey as on the route to Egypt[293].\r\n\r\nBut we hear also of Rhadamanthus as the brother of Minos, of Deucalion\r\nas his son, and of Ariadne as his daughter[294]. And the notices of\r\nthese personages in Homer all tend to magnify our conception of his\r\npower and his connections.\r\n\r\nTheseus, who is glorified by Nestor as a first rate hero[295], and\r\ndescribed as a most famous child of the gods[296], whom both Homer,\r\nand also the later legends connect with Attica, marries Ariadne, who\r\ndies on her way to Athens[297]. The marriages of Homer were generally\r\ncontracted among much nearer neighbours. This more distant connection\r\ncannot, I think, but be taken as indicating the extended relations\r\nconnected with the sovereignty of Minos and his exalted position.\r\n\r\n_Traditions of Deucalion._\r\n\r\nThe genealogy of Idomeneus runs thus[298]; ‘Jupiter begot Minos, ruler\r\nof Crete. Minos begot a distinguished son, Deucalion. Deucalion begot\r\nme, a ruler over numerous subjects in broad Crete.’\r\n\r\nHere it is to be remarked,\r\n\r\n1. That while Minos and Idomeneus, the first and third generations,\r\nare described as ruling in Crete, Deucalion of the second is not so\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n2. That Idomeneus is nowhere described as having succeeded to the\r\nthrone of his grandfather Minos, but only as being a ruler in Crete:\r\nand that, as we have seen, from the qualified conjunction of Meriones\r\nwith him in the command, perhaps also from the limited range of the\r\nCretan towns in the Catalogue, there arises a positive presumption that\r\nhe had succeeded only to a portion of the ancient preeminence and\r\npower of his ancestor.\r\n\r\nNow there is no direct evidence in Homer connecting Deucalion with\r\nThessaly. The later tradition, however, places him there: and this\r\ntradition may probably claim an authority as old as that of Hesiod. A\r\nfragment of that poet[299], with the text partially corrupt, speaks of\r\nLocrus, leader of the Leleges, as among those whom Jupiter raised from\r\nthe earth for Deucalion. This reference to Locrus immediately suggests\r\nthe name of the Locrian race, and so carries us into the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of Thessaly; and the general purport of the words is to\r\nexpress something a little like the later tradition about Deucalion,\r\nwhich had that country for its scene. Combining this with the negative\r\nevidence afforded by the Homeric text, we thus find established a\r\ncommunication seemingly direct between Crete under Minos, and Thessaly,\r\nto which country we have already found it probable that Deucalion\r\nimmigrated, and where he may have reigned.\r\n\r\nThe usual statement is, that the name Deucalion was common to two\r\ndifferent persons, one the son of Minos, and the other the king of\r\nThessaly. But we must be upon our guard against the device of the later\r\nGreek writers, who at once unravelled the accumulated intricacies\r\nthat had gradually gathered about their traditions, and enlarged the\r\nstock of material for pampering vanity, and exciting the imagination,\r\nby multiplying the personages of the early legends. As regards the\r\ncase now before us; the tradition, which makes Hellen son of the\r\nlatter of these Deucalions, would certainly make him considerably\r\nolder than he could be if a son of Minos. It must be admitted, that\r\nHomer repeats the name of Deucalion, for a Trojan so called is slain\r\nby Achilles in Il. xx. 478. It has pleased the fancy of the poet\r\nthere to use the names of a number of dead heroes to distinguish the\r\nwarriors who fell like sheep under the sword of the terrible Achilles:\r\nwe find among them a Dardanus, a Tros, and a Moulius; and it is so\r\nlittle Homer’s practice to use names without a peculiar meaning, that\r\nwe may conjecture he has done it, in preference to letting Achilles\r\nslaughter a crowd of ignoble persons, in order that in every thing his\r\nProtagonist might be distinguished from other men. But the poet seems\r\nto take particular care to prevent any confusion as to his great Greek,\r\nand indeed as to all his great living, personages. I am not aware of\r\nmore than one single passage in the Iliad[300], among the multitude\r\nin which one or other of the Ajaxes is named, where there can be a\r\ndoubt which of the two is meant. It is exceedingly unlikely that if a\r\nseparate Deucalion of Thessaly had been known to Homer, he should not\r\nhave distinguished him from the Deucalion of Crete. This unlikelihood\r\nmounts to incredibility, when we remember (1) that this other Deucalion\r\nof Thessaly is nothing less than the asserted root of the whole\r\nHellenic stock, and (2) that the poet repeatedly uses the patronymic\r\nDeucalides as an individual appellation for Idomeneus, whereas the\r\nadverse supposition would make all the Achæans alike Δευκαλίδαι. We may\r\ntherefore safely conclude at least, that Homer knew of no Deucalion\r\nother than the son of Minos.\r\n\r\n_Of Rhadamanthus and the Phæacians._\r\n\r\nWe come now to Rhadamanthus, who is thrice mentioned by Homer.\r\nOnce[301], as born of the same parents with Minos[302]. Once, as\r\nenjoying like him honours from Jupiter beyond the term of our\r\nordinary human life: for he is placed amidst the calm and comforts\r\nof the Elysian plain. The third passage is remarkable. It is where\r\nAlcinous[303] promises Ulysses conveyance to his home, even should\r\nit be farther than Eubœa, which the Phæacian mariners consider to be\r\ntheir farthest known point of distance, and whither they had conveyed\r\nRhadamanthus,\r\n\r\n    ἐποψόμενον Τίτυον, Γαιήιον υἱόν·\r\n\r\non his way to visit, or inspect, or look after, Tityus. This Tityus we\r\nfind in the νεκυία suffering torture for having attempted violence upon\r\nLatona[304], as she was proceeding towards Pytho, through Panopeus.\r\nPanopeus was a place in Phocis, on the borders of Bœotia, and on the\r\nline of any one journeying between Delos and Delphi.\r\n\r\nThere is in this legend the geographical indistinctness, and even\r\nconfusion, which we commonly find where Homer dealt with places lying\r\nin the least beyond the range of his own experience or that of his\r\nhearers, as was the case with Phæacia. If Tityus was in Panopeus, the\r\nproper way to carry Rhadamanthus was by the Corinthian gulf. But from\r\nvarious points in the geography of the Odyssey, it may, in my opinion,\r\nbe gathered, that Homer had an idea, quite vague and indeterminate as\r\nto distance, of a connection by sea between the north of the Adriatic,\r\nand the north of the Ægean, either directly, or from the sea of\r\nMarmora: and it suited his representation of the Phæacians, and best\r\nmaintained their as it were aerial character, to give them an unknown\r\nrather than a known route. However that might be, if we look into\r\nthe legend in order to conjecture its historic basis, it appears to\r\nsuggest the inferences which follow:\r\n\r\n1. That according to tradition, the empire or supremacy of Minos, which\r\nmay in some points have resembled that afterwards held by Agamemnon,\r\nembraced both Corcyra and likewise middle Greece, where Panopeus and\r\nPytho or Delphi lay.\r\n\r\nWe must, however, presume the empire of Minos to have been in great\r\npart insular. There were contemporary kingdoms on the mainland, which\r\ngive no sign of dependence upon it.\r\n\r\n2. That the Phæacians acted as subjects of Minos in carrying\r\nRhadamanthus by sea from one part of the dominions of that king to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n3. That Rhadamanthus went to punish Tityus as an offender within the\r\nrealm of Minos, and did this on the part and in lieu of Minos himself.\r\n\r\n4. That though he was not Greek by birth, his person, and family, and\r\nempire were all Greek in the view of Homer.\r\n\r\nThis conjectural interpretation of the legend derives support from many\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\nIt is in thorough harmony, as to the extended rule of Minos, with the\r\nEleventh Odyssey, which represents Minos as acting in the capacity of\r\na sovereign in the shades below; which also exhibits, as suffering\r\njudicially the punishments that he awarded, offenders connected with\r\nvarious portions of Greek territory, and among them this very Tityus.\r\n\r\n_Minos: post-Homeric tradition._\r\n\r\nIt is now time to look to the post-Homeric traditions.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the sway of Minos is supported by the tradition of\r\nPelasgus, in the Supplices of Æschylus[305], which represents the\r\nwhole country from (probably) Macedonia to the extreme south of the\r\npeninsula, as having been formerly under one and the same sway. The\r\nempire of Minos may have been magnified into this tradition.\r\n\r\nThe authority of Thucydides is available for the following\r\npoints[306]:--\r\n\r\n1. That Minos was the earliest known possessor of maritime power:\r\nthus harmonising with the hypothesis that the Phæacians, whose great\r\ndistinction was in their nautical character, were acting as his\r\nsubjects when they carried Rhadamanthus.\r\n\r\n2. That his power extended over the Grecian sea, or Ægean (Ἑλληνικὴ\r\nθάλασσα) generally (ἐπὶ πλεῖστον); thus indicating a great extent of\r\nsway.\r\n\r\n3. That he appointed his children to govern his dominions on his behalf\r\n(τοὺς ἑαυτοῦ παῖδας ἡγεμόνας ἐγκαταστήσας): which supports the idea\r\nthat his brother Rhadamanthus may have acted for him at a distance.\r\n\r\n4. That he drove the Carians out of the islands of the Ægean. This\r\nstatement receives remarkable confirmation from Homer, who makes the\r\nislands up to the very coast of Caria contributors to the force of the\r\nGreek army: while Lesbos and others, situated farther north, and more\r\ndistant from Crete, appear to have been, like Caria itself, in the\r\nTrojan interest.\r\n\r\nIn the Minos ascribed to Plato[307] we find the tradition of his direct\r\nrelations with Attica, which were well known to the theatre. This\r\nsupports the notice in Homer of the marriage contracted between Theseus\r\nand his daughter Ariadne.\r\n\r\nAristotle[308], like Thucydides, asserts the maritime power of Minos\r\nand his sovereignty over the islands, and adds, that he lost or ended\r\nhis life in the course of an expedition to conquer Sicily[309].\r\n\r\nHerodotus[310], like Thucydides, treats Minos as the first known\r\nsovereign who had been powerful by sea. He states, that Minos expelled\r\nhis brother Sarpedon from Crete, and that Sarpedon with his adherents\r\ncolonised Lycia, which was governed, down to the time of the historian\r\nhimself, by laws partly Cretan[311]: and he also delivers the tradition\r\nthat Minos was slain in an expedition against Sicily at Camicus,\r\nafterwards Agrigentum. A town bearing his name remained long after in\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\nEuripides laid the scene of his Rhadamanthus in Bœotia: and a Cretan\r\ncolony is said to have established the Tilphosian temple there[312].\r\nHöck finds traces of a marked connection between Crete and that\r\ndistrict[313].\r\n\r\n_Minos: Laconian and Cretan laws._\r\n\r\nMore important, however, than any isolated facts are the resemblances\r\nof the Lacedæmonian and Cretan politics, noticed by Aristotle[314],\r\nin combination with the admission always made by the Lacedæmonians,\r\nthat their lawgiver Lycurgus initiated the Cretan institutions[315],\r\nand with the universal Greek tradition that in Crete, first of all\r\nparts of Greece, laws and a regular polity had been established by\r\nMinos. Again, in the Dialogue printed among the works of Plato, the\r\nauthor of it seeks to establish the fundamental idea of law: puts aside\r\nthe injurious statements of the tragedians who represented Minos as\r\na tyrant, declares his laws to have been the oldest and the best in\r\nGreece, and the models from which the prime parts of the Laconian\r\nlegislation had been borrowed[316].\r\n\r\nAmong the resemblances known to us appear to be\r\n\r\n1. The division between the military and the agricultural part of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n2. The περίοικοι of Crete, holding the same relation to the Cretans, as\r\nthe Helots to the Spartans, and like them cultivating the land.\r\n\r\n3. The institution of συσσίτια in both countries.\r\n\r\n4. The organism of the government: the five ephors corresponding with\r\nthe ten κοσμοὶ of Crete, and the βουλὴ being alike in both.\r\n\r\nThere also still remain etymological indications that Minos was the\r\nperson who raised some tribe or class to preeminence in Crete, and\r\ndepressed some other tribes or classes below the level of the free\r\ncommunity. In Hesychius we read,\r\n\r\n  μνοῖα, οἰκετεία.\r\n\r\n  μνῆτοι, δοῦλοι.\r\n\r\n  μνῶα, δουλεία.\r\n\r\nAnd Athenæus quotes from the Cretica of Sosicrates, τὴν μὲν κοινὴν\r\nδουλείαν οἱ Κρῆτες καλοῦσι μνοίαν· τὴν δὲ ἰδίαν ἀφαμιώτας· τοὺς δὲ\r\nπεριοίκους, ὑπηκόους[317]. He also says, that, according to Ephorus,\r\nthe general name for slave in Crete was κλαρώτης, and that it was\r\nderived from the custom of apportioning the slaves by lot. This\r\nremarkably fixes the character of Cretan slavery as owing its rise\r\nto some institutions public in the highest sense, for merely private\r\nslavery could not, it would appear, have had an origin such as to\r\naccount for the name. It thus indirectly supports the idea implied in\r\nμνοία and μνῆτοι, that it was derived from Minos. Athenæus[318] again,\r\nquoting the _Creticæ glossæ_ of Hermon, gives us the words μνώτας,\r\nτοὺς εὐγενεῖς (otherwise read ἐγγενεῖς) οἰκέτας, and thus pointing to\r\nthe reduction to servitude of some of the previously free population of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that it was the Pelasgic part of the\r\npopulation which thus succumbed before the more active elements of\r\nCretan society, and which continued in the manual occupation of\r\nhusbandry, while war, policy, and maritime pursuits became the lot of\r\ntheir more fortunate competitors. For is it difficult to divine which\r\nwere those more active elements, since Homer points out for us among\r\nthe inhabitants of Crete at least two tribes, the Achæans and the\r\nDorians, of Hellic origin. Bishop Thirlwall points also to a Phœnician\r\nelement in Crete, and to Homer as indicating the Phœnician origin of\r\nMinos. This is suggested not only by his birth, and by his maritime\r\npreeminence, but by Homer’s placing Dædalus in Crete[319]. For that\r\nname directly establishes a connection with the arts that made Sidon\r\nand Phœnicia so famous. The later tradition, indeed, places Dædalus\r\npersonally in relations with Minos, as having been pursued by him after\r\nhe had fled to Sicily[320].\r\n\r\nElsewhere I have shown reason for supposing that a second of the\r\nfive Cretan nations, namely, the Κύδωνες, was Pelasgian: and there\r\nis a curious tradition, which supports this hypothesis. According to\r\nEphorus[321], there were solemn festivals of the slave population,\r\nduring which freemen were not permitted to enter within the walls,\r\nwhile the slaves were supreme, and had the right of flogging the free;\r\nand these festivals were held in Cydonia, the city of these Κύδωνες.\r\n\r\nOur belief in a Cretan empire of Minos, founded on the evidence of\r\nthe Poems, and sustained by the statement of Thucydides, need not\r\nbe impaired by the fact that we find little post-Homeric evidence\r\ndirectly available for its support. In early times the recollection of\r\ndynasties very much depended on the interest which their successors\r\nhad in keeping it alive. Now the Minoan empire was already reduced to\r\nfragments at the time of the _Troica_. The supremacy over Greece was\r\nthen in the hands of a family that held the throne of the Perseids and\r\nthe Danaids, a throne older than that of Minos himself, though in his\r\ntime probably less distinguished: a throne whose lustre would have\r\nbeen diminished by a lively tradition of his power and greatness. And\r\nit was from the Pelopids that the Dorian sovereigns of Sparta claimed\r\nto inherit. Therefore the great Greek sovereignty, from the _Troica_\r\nonwards, had no interest in cherishing the recollection of this ancient\r\npart of history; on the contrary, their interest lay in depressing\r\nit; and under these circumstances we need not wonder that, until the\r\ninquiring age of Greek literature and philosophy, when Athens gained\r\nthe predominance, the traces of it should have remained but faint. But\r\nthe traces of Cretans have been found extensively dispersed both over\r\nthe islands, and on the coasts of the Ægean[322].\r\n\r\n_The Lycians._\r\n\r\nTo complete the statement of this part of the case, it is necessary to\r\nturn to another country, holding, with its inhabitants, a very peculiar\r\nposition in the Iliad. The attentive reader of the poem must often\r\ninquire, with curiosity and wonder, why it is that Homer everywhere\r\nfollows the Lycian name with favour so marked, that it may almost be\r\ncalled favouritism. At every turn, which brings that people into view,\r\nwe are met by the clearest indications of it: and few of Homer’s\r\nindications, none of his marked indications, are without a cause and an\r\naim.\r\n\r\nSarpedon, the Lycian commander in chief, performs the greatest\r\nmilitary exploit on the Trojan side that is to be found throughout\r\nthe poems[323]. That he does not obscure the eminence of Hector is\r\nonly owing to the fact, that his share in the action of the poem is\r\nsmaller, not to its being less distinguished. Everywhere he plays his\r\npart with a faultless valour, a valour set off by his modesty, and by\r\nhis keen sense of public duty according to the strictest meaning of the\r\nterm[324]; Jupiter, his father, sheds tears of blood for his coming\r\ndeath; and he is in truth the most perfect as well as the bravest man\r\non the Trojan side. Glaucus, his second in command, is inferior to no\r\nTrojan warrior save Hector, though in the exchange of the arms with\r\nDiomed Homer has, as usual, reserved the superiority to the Grecian\r\nintellect.\r\n\r\nThe distinctions awarded to the Lycian people are in full proportion\r\nto those of their king Sarpedon. They formed one only among the eleven\r\ndivisions of the auxiliary force, but the Lycian[325] name, and theirs\r\nonly[326], evidently on account of their eminence, is often used to\r\nsignify the entire body. In the great assault on the Greek trench and\r\nrampart, Sarpedon their leader commands all the allies, and chooses as\r\nhis lieutenants Glaucus, and Asteropæus a Pæonian, but not the Pæonian\r\ngeneral[327]. They are never mentioned with any epithet except of\r\nhonour: and to them is applied the term ἀντίθεοι[328], which is given\r\nto no other tribe or nation in the Iliad, and in the Odyssey only to\r\nthe Phæacians[329]; to these last it appertains doubtless on account\r\nof their relationship to the immortals. The Lycian attack in the\r\nTwelfth Book is the one really formidable to the Greeks[330], and in\r\nthe rout of the Sixteenth Book we are told, that ‘not even the stalwart\r\n(ἴφθιμοι) Lycians’ held their ground after the death of Sarpedon[331].\r\nThey alone are appealed to in the name of that peculiar and sacred\r\nsentiment of military honour called αἰδὼς, which, with this single\r\nexception, seems to be the exclusive property of the Greeks[332].\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to account for this glowing representation, so\r\nconsistently carried through the poem, except upon the supposition,\r\nthat Homer regarded the Lycians as having some peculiar affinity or\r\nother relation with the Greeks; and that he on this account raised\r\nthem out of what would otherwise more naturally have been a secondary\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nThere are many signs of a specific kind, that this was actually his\r\nview of them.\r\n\r\n1. To make Sarpedon the son of Jupiter was at once to establish some\r\nrelationship with the Greek races.\r\n\r\n2. The legend of Bellerophon, delivered on the field of battle, was\r\nnot required, nor is it introduced, merely to fill up the time during\r\nwhich Hector goes from the camp to the city. It required no filling\r\nup: but Homer turns the interval to account by using it to give us\r\nthis interesting chapter of archaic history, doubtless in order to\r\nillustrate, as all his other legends do, the beginnings and early\r\nrelations of the Hellenic races. Accordingly we find that Antea, wife\r\nof Prœtus the Argive king, was a Lycian: that a familiar intercourse\r\nsubsisted between the two courts, such as probably and strongly implies\r\nthat the nations had other ties: and lastly that an Æolid line of\r\nsovereigns, descended through Sisyphus, were the actual governors of\r\nLycia at the period of the _Troica_.\r\n\r\n3. The very same ideas of kingship and its offices, which prevailed\r\nin Greece, are expressed by Sarpedon in his speech to Glaucus[333],\r\nand there is an indication of free institutions which enlarges the\r\nresemblance. The force of this circumstance will be more fully\r\nappreciated, when we shall have examined the Asiatic tinge which is\r\nperceptible in the institutions of Troy itself.\r\n\r\n4. Besides the Æolid sovereignty, the etymology of the names of Lycian\r\nwarriors connects itself not only with the Greek race, but with the\r\nHellic element in that race[334].\r\n\r\n5. On the other hand Apollo, whom we shall hereafter find to be the\r\ngreat Pelasgian, though also universal, god, is even, according to\r\nHomer, in close and peculiar connection with Lycia, although he is\r\nnot localized there by Homer as he is in the later tradition. First\r\nas being λυκηγενής. Secondly as the great bowman: while Lycia was so\r\neminent in this art, that Æneas, addressing Pandarus with a compliment\r\non his skill, says no man before Troy can match him, and perhaps even\r\nin Lycia there may not be a better archer[335]. Thirdly, this Pandarus\r\nthe archer, and son of Lycaon, received the gift of his bow from Apollo\r\nhimself[336]: and says, that Apollo prompted or instructed him, as\r\nhe came from Lycia[337]. It may, however, be reasonably questioned,\r\nwhether we are here to understand the Lycia of the South, or the\r\ndistrict of kindred name in Troas. In any case, Apollo in Lycia would\r\nbe no more than the counterpart of Minerva in Pelasgian Athens.\r\n\r\n6. The prevalence of that Lycian name in other quarters, such as\r\nArcadia, of a marked Pelasgian character, further supports the\r\nsupposition that Lycia had probably a Pelasgian race for the bulk of\r\nits population, holding the same subordinate relation to another race\r\nas we find in corresponding cases. In Arcadia[338] Pausanias reports a\r\nLycaon son of Pelasgus; a Lycosura, the city he founded; Lyceon, the\r\nhill where it stood; and Lycea, the games he established.\r\n\r\nAll this evidence combines to show some correspondence between Lycia\r\nand Greece, as to the constituent elements of the population. The\r\nagreement could not have been perfect: for the records of the Lycian\r\nlanguage, I believe, show a prevalence of other elements than the\r\nGreek. But we have thus a reason to suppose, that the community of\r\narchitecture and other arts which has been found to subsist between the\r\ntwo countries, was not merely dependent on later colonisation, but was\r\nowing to an affinity of races and similarity of manners which dates\r\nfrom the heroic age.\r\n\r\nLastly, the fragments of Homeric evidence respecting the Lycians are\r\ncombined by a later tradition, which links them to Crete, the main\r\nsubject of our recent inquiry. According to this tradition, there was a\r\nSarpedon earlier than the Sarpedon of the _Troica_, who, besides being\r\nson of Jupiter, was brother to Minos. He is said to have been expelled,\r\nwith his adherents, by that sovereign from Crete; to have repaired to\r\nLycia, and to have colonised that country, or a part of it. In the\r\ntime of Herodotus, as we have seen, it retained laws of Cretan, that\r\nis to say of Greek, origin. And at two later periods of its history,\r\nfar remote from Homer and from one another, its inhabitants signalised\r\nthemselves by the most desperate valour in defence of Xanthus, its\r\ncapital[339].\r\n\r\nFor the origin of the group of names, having Λύκος or some similar\r\nword for their root, it seems most natural to infer its identity with\r\nthe Latin _lucus_, essentially the same with _lupus_, and to presume\r\nthat it had a Pelasgic source, but that the word corresponding with\r\nit, probably Λύκος, meaning a wood or grove, had become obsolete in\r\nthe later Hellenic tongue. There is every reason for a supposition of\r\nthis kind, as these words, etymologically connected, evidently hang\r\nround some common centre, which centre has reference to primitive and\r\nto Pelasgic life, as well as to the somewhat specially Pelasgic deity\r\nApollo. Nor is it strange that the root of a name associated with the\r\nPelasgi should have been lost to the Greek tongue, while the name\r\nitself remains: we have another example in Larissa.\r\n\r\nBut if there was such a word, with such a meaning, the link, which\r\nmay perhaps connect it with Pelasgic life, is evident. For the first\r\nagricultural settlers must often be, as such, in a greater or less\r\ndegree, dwellers in woods. It may be said that in the United States,\r\nat the present day, the proper name for an agricultural settler is\r\n‘backwoodsman.’ In British colonies of Australia, they, who pass beyond\r\nthe limits of existing settlement, in order to extend it, are said to\r\ngo into the bush. Thus the idea at the root of the Lycian name is in\r\nall probability twin, or rather elder brother, to that which properly\r\nwould indicate the agricultural settler.\r\n\r\nIt is however plain, that we cannot look to any thing simply Pelasgian\r\nin the Lycian population, as supplying the motive which has induced\r\nHomer to give the Lycians a marked preference over other populations,\r\nthemselves of a Pelasgian character. This preference must be due to\r\nthe other element, which associates them especially with the Hellenic\r\nrace. And we may not irrationally suppose it to be founded on any one\r\nof such causes as these: the special connection in the royal line\r\nbetween the two countries: a larger infusion of the more lordly blood\r\ninto a subordinate Lelegian or Pelasgian body in Lycia, just as in\r\nGreece, than in Troas and Asia Minor generally: or lastly, a more\r\npalpable and near connection between the dominant caste in Lycia and\r\nthose Persian highlanders, from among whom may have proceeded[340]\r\nthe forefathers of the Hellenic tribes. Everywhere we see this race\r\nbranching forth, and, by an intrinsic superiority, acquiring a\r\npredominance over the races in prior occupation. Whether the stock came\r\nto Lycia by land, or from the eastern coast of the Mediterranean, it\r\nmay be hard even to conjecture: but there is one particular note of\r\nrelationship to Persia, which Lycia retains more clearly than Greece,\r\nand that is the high estimation in which, to judge from the connection\r\nwith Apollo and from Il. v. 172, the use of the bow was held in that\r\ncountry. The case was the same in Persia. According to Herodotus, one\r\nof the three essential articles of education in Persia was the use of\r\nthe bow[341]; and he is not contradicted by Ctesias, who calls him in\r\nmost things a liar and a fabulist[342]. We must not, indeed, rely too\r\nstrongly upon a circumstance like this. Cyaxares the Median had the\r\nart taught to his sons by Nomad Scythians[343]. We may however observe\r\nthat alike on the Trojan and the Grecian side we never hear of the\r\nbow except in the hands of highborn persons, such as Paris, Pandarus,\r\nTeucer: and, in the games, Meriones[344].\r\n\r\nIn passing, it may deserve remark, that the Lycians alone, of all\r\ntribes or nations on either side, appear not under two leaders merely,\r\nbut two kings, in the strict sense. I do not however believe that this\r\nindicates a political peculiarity. The origin of it may probably be\r\nfound in the legend of Bellerophon, to whom, after his high exploits\r\nand great services, the reigning sovereign gave half his kingdom[345].\r\nNow that king is nowhere stated to have had a son: and if we suppose a\r\nfailure of issue in his own direct line, and the succession of one of\r\nthe two descendants of his daughter to each moiety of the realm, it at\r\nonce accounts for the exceptional position of Sarpedon and Glaucus.\r\n\r\nThe suppositions then towards which we are led are, that Minos was of\r\nPhœnician origin, that he came to Crete and acquired the sovereignty,\r\nthat he ruled over a mixed population of Cretans, Pelasgians, and\r\nHellic tribes, that he organised the country and established an\r\nextended supremacy, especially maritime and insular, beyond its\r\nlimits; which however we must not consider as involving the consistent\r\nmaintenance of sovereignty according to modern ideas, and which is\r\nin no degree inconsistent with the rule of Danaids or Perseids in\r\nPeloponnesus. Lastly, that in giving form to his social institutions,\r\nhe depressed the Pelasgian element of Cretan society, and laid, in\r\npolitical depression, the foundations of their subsequent servitude.\r\n\r\n_Cyprus._\r\n\r\nIf this be so, it is worth while further to observe, that there are\r\ntraces of a somewhat analogous history in Cyprus, another acknowledged\r\nstepping-stone, according to Homer[346], between Greece and the East.\r\n\r\nIn the Seventeenth Book of the Odyssey[347], Ulysses, in one of his\r\nfictitious narrations, states to the Suitors, that the Egyptians, who\r\nhad taken him prisoner and reduced him to slavery, then made a present\r\nof him to their ξεῖνος Dmetor, a descendant of Iasus, who ruled ‘with\r\nmight,’ that is, with considerable power over Cyprus (ὃς Κύπρου ἶφι\r\nἄνασσεν); the same expression as he uses in the Eleventh Book with\r\nrespect to Amphion, the Iasid, in Orchomenus. From all we know of the\r\nIasian name[348], it may be inferred that this was a Pelasgian dynasty,\r\nand if so, then without doubt that it ruled over a Pelasgian people.\r\n\r\nUlysses does not mention the time of this transaction; and it must be\r\nremembered, that he spoke in the character of an aged person, so that\r\nthe scene might be laid (so to speak) thirty or forty years back, and\r\ntherefore long before the expedition to Troy.\r\n\r\nBut in the Eleventh Book of the Iliad[349], we find Agamemnon putting\r\non a breastplate, which was evidently a marvel of workmanship, with\r\nits plates on plates of different metals, and its six dragons flashing\r\nforth the colours of the rainbow. Now we must observe, first, that this\r\nwas evidently meant to be understood as a Sidonian or Phœnician work:\r\nsecondly, that it was presented to Agamemnon by Cinyres of Cyprus, to\r\nconciliate his favour (--χαριζόμενος βασιλῆï, perhaps we might render\r\nit, to win the favour of _his_ king--) upon the occasion of his hearing\r\nthat the king was collecting an armament against Troy. That is to\r\nsay, it was to compound with him for not appearing in person to join\r\nthe Greek forces. Here then we must infer that there was some vague\r\nallegiance, which was due, or which at least might be claimed, from\r\nCyprus to Agamemnon, under the πολλῇσιν νήσοισι[350].\r\n\r\nNow we know nothing of the Pelopids before the _Troica_ as conquerors:\r\nand especially, it would be difficult to apply the supposition that\r\nthey were such in relation to a place so distant. Therefore the\r\npolitical connection, whatever it may have been, could probably rest\r\nupon an ethnical affinity alone; and, as we know nothing of any Hellic\r\nelement in this quarter, that affinity seems to presume the Pelasgian\r\ncharacter of the population. The inference, which may thus be drawn,\r\ncoincides with that already suggested by the name of Iasus.\r\n\r\nWe may however justly be curious to learn what conditions they were\r\nwhich gave to Cinyres, and so far as we know to Cinyres alone, among\r\nprinces, this very peculiar attitude at a critical juncture. It is\r\nobvious, that in proportion as his situation was remote from the Greek\r\nrendezvous, and from the scene of action, the service became more\r\nburdensome: but on the other hand, in proportion as he was distant\r\nfrom the centre of Achæan power, he was little likely to be coerced.\r\nHow comes it then that Agamemnon had over Cinyres an influence which\r\nhe does not seem to have possessed over the tribes of Macedonia and\r\nThrace, though these lay nearer both to him, and to the way between him\r\nand the Troad, which he had to traverse by sea?\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis, that the population of Cyprus was purely or generally\r\nPelasgian, appears to square remarkably with the facts. For then, upon\r\nthe one hand, they would naturally be disinclined to interfere on\r\nbehalf of the Greeks in a war where all purely Pelasgian sympathies\r\nwould (as we must for the present take for granted) incline them\r\ntowards Troy.\r\n\r\nBut further, we find among other notes of the Pelasgians this, that\r\nthey were characterised by a want of nautical genius, while the more\r\nenterprising character of the Hellenes at once made them, and has kept\r\nthem down to this very day, an eminently maritime people; and Homer\r\nhimself, with his whole soul, evidently gloried and delighted in the\r\nsea. If then the population of Cyprus was Pelasgian, we can readily\r\nunderstand how, notwithstanding its sympathies and its remoteness,\r\nit might be worth the while of its ruler to propitiate Agamemnon\r\nby a valuable gift in order to avert a visit which his ships might\r\notherwise be expected to pay; and how the Pelopid power over Cyprus,\r\nas an island, might be greater than over nearer tribes, which were\r\ncontinental.\r\n\r\nIt may aid us to comprehend the relation between Cyprus and Agamemnon,\r\nif we call to recollection the insular empire which Athens afterwards\r\nacquired.\r\n\r\nThere is another sign, which strongly tends to connect Cyprus with\r\nthe Pelasgian races, especially those which belong to Asia. It is the\r\nworship of Venus, who had in that island her especial sanctuary, and\r\nwho, upon her detection in the Odyssey[351], takes refuge there. In\r\nthe war, she is keenly interested on the Trojan side: and the Trojan\r\nhistory is too plainly marked with the influence of the idea, that\r\nexalted her to Olympian rank. That Venus was known mythologically among\r\nthe Hellenic tribes, we see from the lay of Demodocus. That she was\r\nworshipped among them, seems to be rendered extremely improbable by the\r\nfact, that Diomed wounds her in his ἀριστεῖα[352]. We must consider\r\nher as a peculiarly, and perhaps in Homer’s time almost exclusively\r\nPelasgian deity; and her local abode at Paphos may be taken as a marked\r\nsign, accordingly, of the Pelasgianism of Cyprus.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen Agapenor, a stranger, placed by Agamemnon in\r\ncommand of the Pelasgian forces of Arcadia; and Minos, a stranger,\r\nacquire dominion over the partially, and perhaps mainly, Pelasgian\r\npopulation of Crete. It seems probable, that Cyprus in this too\r\naffords us a parallel. We have the following considerations to guide\r\nus in the question. First, the Pelasgians, not being a maritime, were\r\nconsequently not a mercantile people. Secondly, from the description\r\nof the gift sent by Cinyres, we must understand it, on account of\r\nthe preciousness of its materials and its ornaments, to have been\r\na first rate example of the skill of the workers in metal of the\r\nperiod. Such things were not produced by Pelasgians; and we must, to\r\nbe consistent with all the other Homeric indications, suppose this\r\nbreastplate to have been of Sidonian or Phœnician workmanship. This\r\nsupposition connects Cinyres himself with Phœnicia, while his people\r\nwere Pelasgian. Again, on examining his name we find in it no Pelasgian\r\ncharacteristics; but it appears to be Asiatic, and to signify a musical\r\ninstrument with strings, which was used in Asia[353]. All this makes it\r\nlikely, upon Homeric presumptions, that he was a Phœnician, or a person\r\nof Phœnician connections, and that into his hands the old Pelasgic\r\nsovereignty of Minos had passed over from the Iasid family, which had\r\nreigned there shortly before the _Troica_.\r\n\r\nThe Homeric tradition with respect to Cinyres is supported to some\r\nextent from without[354]. Apollodorus so far agrees with it as to\r\nreport, that Cinyres migrated from the neighbouring Asiatic continent\r\ninto Cyprus with a body of followers, founded Paphos, and married the\r\ndaughter of the king of the island. Apollodorus, Pindar, and Ovid, all\r\ntreat Cinyres in a way which especially connects him with the worship\r\nof Venus, as though he had introduced it into the island; and it is\r\nobservable, that the points at which we find this deity in contact with\r\nthe race are all in Asia, or on the way from it, that is to say, Troas,\r\nCyprus, and lastly, Cythera: as if it were not original to the Greeks,\r\nbut engrafted, and gradually taking its hold. Sandacus was, according\r\nto Apollodorus, the father of Cinyres, and had come from Syria into\r\nCilicia.\r\n\r\nThe process which we thus seem to see going forward in the Pelasgian\r\ncountries, and which was probably further exemplified in the Greek\r\nmigrations to the coast of Asia Minor, was grounded in the natural,\r\nif we mean by the natural the ordinary, course of things. In the last\r\ncentury, John Wesley said, that the religious and orderly habits of\r\nhis followers would make them wealthy, and that then their wealth\r\nwould destroy their religion. So in all likelihood it was the peaceful\r\nhabits of the Pelasgians that made their settlements attractive to the\r\nspoiler. They thus invited aggression, which their political genius and\r\norganization were not strong enough to repel; and the power of their\r\nancient but feeble sovereignties passed over into the hands of families\r\nor tribes more capable of permanently retaining it, and of wielding it\r\nwith vigour and effect.\r\n\r\n_Negative argument from Homer._\r\n\r\nI must not, however, pass from the subject of Homeric testimony\r\nrespecting the Pelasgi, without adverting to one important negative\r\npart of it.\r\n\r\nIt must be observed, that, as anterior to the three appellatives which\r\nhe ordinarily applies to the Greeks of the Trojan war collectively,\r\nHomer uses no name whatever other than the Pelasgic, which is not of\r\nlimited and local application. Neither Ἀχαιοὶ, Ἀργεῖοι, nor Δαναοὶ,\r\nbear any one sign of being the proper designation of the original\r\nsettlers and inhabitants of all Greece: and if the name for them be\r\nnot Πελασγοὶ, there certainly is no other name whatever which can\r\ncompete for the honour, none which has the same marks at once of great\r\nantiquity, and of covering a wide range of the country. And if, as I\r\ntrust, it shall hereafter be shown, that all these came from abroad\r\nas strangers into a country already occupied, there then will be a\r\npresumption of no mean force arising even out of this negative, to the\r\neffect that the Pelasgians were the original base of the Greek nation,\r\nwhile we are also entitled to affirm, upon the evidence of Homer, that\r\ntheir race extended beyond the limits of Greece.\r\n\r\nSuch is the supposition upon which we already begin to find that\r\nthe testimony of the poems as a whole appears to converge. It is, I\r\ngrant, indirect, and fragmentary, and much of it conjectural; we may\r\ngreatly enlarge its quantity from sources not yet opened: but I wish to\r\ndirect particular attention to its unity and harmony, to the multitude\r\nof indications which, though separate and individually slight, all\r\ncoincide with the theory that the Pelasgi supplied the _substratum_ of\r\nthe Greek population subsisting under dominant Hellic influences; and\r\nto the fact, I would almost venture to add, that they can coincide with\r\nnothing else.\r\n\r\n_The Pelasgians; post-Homeric evidence._\r\n\r\nWe must proceed, however, to consider that portion of the evidence in\r\nthe case, which is external to the Homeric Poems.\r\n\r\nBesides what has been up to this point incidentally touched, there is\r\na great mass of extra-Homeric testimony, which tends, when read in the\r\nlight of Homer, to corroborate the views which have here been taken of\r\nthe Pelasgi, as one of the main coefficients of the Greek nation.\r\n\r\nIn the first chapter of the able work of Bishop Marsh, entitled, _Horæ\r\nPelasgicæ_[355], will be found an ample collection of passages from\r\nGreek writers, which, though many of them are in themselves slight,\r\nand any one if taken singly could be of little weight for the purpose\r\nof proof, yet collectively indicate that the possession of the entire\r\ncountry at the remotest period by the Pelasgi was little less than an\r\nuniversal and invariable tradition. I will here collect some portion of\r\nthe evidence which may be cited to this effect.\r\n\r\nComing next to Homer in time and in authority, Hesiod supports him, as\r\nwe have seen above[356], in associating Dodona both with the Pelasgic\r\nand with the Hellic races; placing it, just as Homer does, in the midst\r\nof the latter, and more distinctly than Homer indicating its foundation\r\nby the former. It may be observed that, in a Fragment, he questionably\r\npersonifies Pelasgus[357].\r\n\r\nNext we find the very ancient poet Asius, according to the quotation of\r\nPausanias[358], assigning the very highest antiquity to the Pelasgian\r\nrace, by making Pelasgus the father of men;\r\n\r\n    ἀντίθεον δὲ Πελασγὸν ἐν ὑψικόμοισιν ὄρεσσι\r\n    γαῖα μέλαιν’ ἀνέδωκεν, ἵνα θνητῶν γένος εἴη.\r\n\r\nAmong the Greek writers, not being historians themselves, of the\r\nhistoric period, there is none whose testimony bears, to my perception,\r\nso much of the true archaic stamp, as Æschylus. It seems as if we could\r\ntrace in him a greater piety towards Homer, and we certainly find a\r\nmore careful regard both to his characters and his facts, than were\r\nafterwards commonly paid to them. Nay he excels in this respect the\r\nCyclic poets. They were much nearer in date to the great master, but\r\nhe, as it were, outran them, by a deeper and nobler sympathy. In him,\r\ntoo, the drama had not yet acquired the character, which effaces or\r\nimpairs its claims to historical authority: which earned for it the\r\nἐκτραγῳδεῖν of Aristotle[359] and Polybius[360], and on which was\r\nfounded the declaration of Socrates in the Minos, Ἀττικὸν λέγεις μῦθον\r\nκαὶ τραγικόν[361]. Even where he speaks allegorically, he seems to\r\nrepresent the first form of allegory, in which it is traceably moulded\r\nupon history, and serves for its key. It is not therefore unreasonable\r\nto attach importance to his rendering of the public tradition\r\nrespecting the Pelasgi, which we find in a remarkable passage of the\r\nSupplices;\r\n\r\n    τοῦ γηγενοῦς γάρ εἰμ’ ἐγὼ Παλαίχθονος\r\n    ἶνις Πελασγὸς, τῆσδε γῆς ἀρχηγέτης.\r\n    ἐμοῦ δ’ ἄνακτος εὐλόγως ἐπώνυμον\r\n    γένος Πελασγῶν τήνδε καρποῦται χθόνα[362].\r\n\r\nPelasgus, himself the speaker, then describes his dominions as reaching\r\nfrom Peloponnesus (χώρη Ἀπίη) in the south to the river Strymon in\r\nthe north (πρὸς δύνοντος ἡλίου), and declares how Apis, coming from\r\nAcarnania, had fitted the country for the abode of man by clearing it\r\nof wild beasts. Acarnania marks the line of country, which formed the\r\nordinary route from Thessaly to Peloponnesus. Taken literally, Pelasgus\r\nis the son of the Earthborn, and the name-giver of the Pelasgian race.\r\nWhat the passage signifies evidently is, that by ancient tradition\r\nthe Pelasgians were the first occupants of the country, and that they\r\nreached from the north to the south of Greece. It is in the reign of\r\nthis mythical Pelasgus, that Danaus reaches the Peloponnesus.\r\n\r\nOf such an _eponymus_ Thessaly, Argos, and Arcadia had each their\r\nseparate tradition in its appropriate dress. Pausanias reports the\r\nArcadian one very fully: and according to its tenour Pelasgus taught\r\nthe use of dwellings and clothes, and to eat chestnuts instead of\r\nroots, grass, and leaves[363]. The tomb of Pelasgus was pretended to be\r\nshown at Argos.\r\n\r\nHerodotus states that the Hellas of his day was formerly called\r\nΠελασγία[364]: gives to the Peloponnesian women of the era of Danaus\r\nthe name of Πελασγιωτίδες γυναῖκες[365]: he denominates the Arcadians\r\nΠελασγοὶ Ἀρκάδες[366], the people of what was afterwards Achaia\r\nΠελασγοὶ Αἰγιαλέες[367], the Athenians Πελασγοὶ Κραναοὶ[368], whom also\r\nhe describes as autochthonic[369]: and he shows, that recollections\r\nof the Pelasgian worship were preserved in his day at Dodona[370].\r\nHe furthermore mentions the Πελασγικὸν τεῖχος[371] at Athens; and he\r\nplaces the Pelasgian race in Samothrace, and Lemnos, and mentions their\r\nsettlements upon the Hellespont, named Placia and Scylace.\r\n\r\nThucydides describes the spot or building called Πελασγικὸν under\r\nthe Acropolis at Athens, the very situation, in which the original\r\ntown would in all likelihood be placed for safety. This historian\r\nalso sustains, with the weight of his judgment, the opinion that\r\nin pre-Hellenic times the prevailing race and name in Greece were\r\nPelasgic; κατὰ ἔθνη δὲ ἄλλα τε καὶ τὸ Πελασγικὸν ἐπὶ πλεῖστον[372].\r\n\r\nIt is true, that in another passage[373], among the races of the\r\nβάρβαροι, he enumerates the Pelasgi: but the epithet itself, which\r\nwas wholly inapplicable to the heroic age, shows that he spoke with\r\nreference to the demarcation established in his own time, which made\r\nevery thing barbarous that was not Greek, either geographically or\r\nby known derivation. Barbarian with him and his contemporaries meant\r\nsimply foreign, with the addition of a strong dash of depreciation.\r\nThe full-grown Hellenic character no longer owned kindred with the\r\nparticular races, which nevertheless might have contributed, each in\r\nits own time and place, to the formation of that remarkable product.\r\nThe relationship is, however, established by Thucydides himself; for he\r\nsays these Pelasgi were of the same Tyrseni, who occupied Athens at an\r\nearlier period.\r\n\r\nTheocritus, who flourished early in the third century B. C., has a\r\npassage where he distinguishes chronologically between different\r\npersons and races. He begins with the heroes of the Troica, and then\r\ngoes back to the ἔτι πρότεροι, in which capacity he names the Lapithæ,\r\nthe Deucalidæ, the Pelopids, and lastly the Ἄργεος ἄκρα Πελασγοί[374].\r\nThe word ἄκρα might mean either (1) the flower of Greece, or (2)\r\nthe very oldest and earliest inhabitants of Greece[375]. Now as the\r\nPelasgians were by no means the flower of Greece, we can only choose\r\nthe latter meaning for this particular passage. The word Ἄργος is\r\nperhaps taken here in its largest sense[376].\r\n\r\nApollonius Rhodius, nearly a century later, adheres to part at\r\nleast of the same tradition, and calls Thessaly the πολυλήïος αἶα\r\nΠελασγῶν[377]. The Scholiast on this passage adds an older testimony,\r\nstating that Sophocles, in the Inachus, declared that the Πελασγοὶ and\r\nἈργεῖοι were the same.\r\n\r\nAccording to Strabo, the Pelasgi were the most ancient race which\r\nhad held power in Greece: τῶν περὶ τὴν Ἑλλάδα δυναστευσάντων\r\nἀρχαιότατοι[378]. In the same place he calls the oracle of Dodona\r\nΠελασγῶν ἵδρυμα, a Pelasgian foundation. He expressly supports the\r\nconstruction which has been given above to the Πελασγικὸν Ἄργος of\r\nHomer[379], in the words τὸ Πελασγικὸν Ἄργος ἡ Θετταλία λέγεται, and he\r\ndefines the country by the Peneus, Pindus, and Thermopylæ. He traces\r\nthe Pelasgi in a multitude of particular places, and, on the authority\r\nof Ephorus, mentions Πελασγία as a name of Peloponnesus. He also gives\r\nus that fragment of Euripides, which states, in harmony with the\r\ntestimony of Æschylus, that Danaus came to Greece, founded the city of\r\nInachus, and changed the name of the inhabitants from Pelasgiotes to\r\nDanaans.\r\n\r\n    Πελασγιώτας δ’ ὠνομασμένους τὸ πρὶν\r\n    Δαναοὺς καλεῖσθαι νόμον ἔθηκ’ ἀν’ Ἑλλάδα.\r\n\r\nAnd Strabo considers that both the Pelasgiote and the Danaan name,\r\ntogether with that of the Hellenes, were covered by the Argive or\r\nArgeian name on account of the fame, to which the city of Argos\r\nrose[380].\r\n\r\nThe writings of Dionysius of Halicarnassus probably represent all, that\r\na sound judgment could gather from the records and traditions extant in\r\nhis time[381]. He pronounces confidently, that the Pelasgian race was\r\nHellenic; which I take to mean, that it was one of the component parts\r\nof the body afterwards called Hellenic, not that the early Pelasgi were\r\nincluded among the early Hellenes. He considers that the race came from\r\nPeloponnesus, where many believed it to be autochthonic, into Thessaly,\r\nunder Achæus, Phthius, and Pelasgus. It was unfortunate, as in other\r\nrespects, so in being driven to frequent migrations. This idea of the\r\nfrequent displacement of the Pelasgians was probably the product in the\r\nmain of the two facts, first, that traces of them were found at many\r\nwidely separated points, and secondly, that, according to tradition,\r\nthey had sunk into a position of inferiority.\r\n\r\nK. O. Müller, proceeding chiefly on the post-Homeric tradition, has\r\nstrongly summed up the evidence as to the Pelasgi, to the following\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nThey were the original inhabitants of the plains and flat bottoms of\r\nthe valleys, any one of which the ancients called by the name Ἄργος, as\r\nwe see by the plains of the Peneus, and of the Inachus. If, as Strabo\r\nholds, this use of the word was in his time modern, and Macedonian or\r\nThessalian, it may still have been a revival of a primitive usage,\r\neven as the very old word Γραικὸς had come back into use with the\r\nAlexandrian poets, through the old common tongue of Macedonia.\r\n\r\nTheir oldest towns were the Larissæ[382], and the number of these\r\npoints out the Pelasgians as a city-founding people, expert in raising\r\nconsiderable and durable structures. These Larissæ were upon alluvial\r\nsoils by rivers, and the Pelasgians were early diggers of canals[383].\r\nTheir pursuits were agricultural; hence they occupy the richest soils:\r\nhence Pelasgus is the host of Ceres, and the inventor of bread: hence\r\nTyrrhenian Pelasgi convert the stony ground by Hymettus into fruitful\r\nfields. The shepherd life of the Pelasgians is an Arcadian tradition,\r\nbut Arcadia was not their only original seat, and, when displaced by\r\nAchæans and Dorians, they may have been driven to the hills. Such seats\r\nwe find in Argos, Achaia, Peloponnesus generally, Thessalia, Epirus,\r\nand Attica, where they may be traced in the division of the tribes.\r\n\r\nTreating as an error the tradition of their vagrant character, he\r\nconceives them to be generally and above all autochthonic. He quotes\r\nfrom Asius in Pausanias the lines which have already been quoted.\r\n\r\nThere is no record, he says, of their coming into Greece by\r\ncolonization. They are a people distinct, he thinks, from Lelegians\r\nand Carians, as well as from the northern immigrants, Achæans, and\r\nThessalians: and they are the basis and groundwork of the Greek\r\nnation[384].\r\n\r\nIn Niebuhr[385] will be found a comprehensive outline of the wide range\r\nof Pelasgian occupancy in Italy: and Cramer supplies a similar sketch\r\nfor Asia Minor and for Greece[386].\r\n\r\nI forbear to quote Latin authorities as to the Pelasgi of Greece. The\r\nstrong Pelasgian character of Magna Græcia will of itself naturally\r\naccount for the free use of the name by Romans to designate the Greek\r\nnation, and cannot therefore greatly serve to show even the later\r\ntradition concerning the ancient position of the Pelasgians in Greece,\r\nand their relations to its other inhabitants.\r\n\r\nMarsh appears to assert too much, when he says that we may set down as\r\npeculiarly Pelasgian those places which retained the Pelasgian name in\r\nthe historic ages. It does not follow from this retention, that Placia\r\nand Scylace were more genuinely Pelasgian than Thessaly, any more than\r\nwe are entitled to say from Homer, that Thessaly was originally more\r\nPelasgian than Attica or Peloponnesus, though it retained the name\r\nlonger. The reason may have been, that no such powerful pressure from a\r\nsuperior race was brought to bear in the one class of cases, as in the\r\nother[387].\r\n\r\nIn holding that the Pelasgians were the base, so to speak, of the\r\nGreek nation, I mean to indicate it as a probable opinion, that they\r\ncontinued to form the mass of the inhabitants throughout all the\r\nchanges of name which succeeded the period of their rule. But it would\r\nappear, that a succession of other more vigorous influences from the\r\nHellic stock must have contributed far more powerfully in all respects,\r\nexcepting as to numbers, to compose and shape the nationality of the\r\npeople. The chief part of the Pelasgians of Attica may perhaps have\r\nlain among the 400,000 slaves, who formed the unheeded herd of its\r\npopulation; much as in Italy the serfs of the Greek colonists bore the\r\nPelasgian name[388]. So large a body could scarcely have been formed\r\nin that limited territory, except out of the original inhabitants of\r\nthe country. In early stages of society the bulk of society takes its\r\nimpress from one, or from a few, of superior force: and the ruling\r\nfamilies and tribes of a smaller, but more energetic and warlike race,\r\nfinding for themselves a natural place at the head of societies already\r\nconstituted, assume the undisputed direction of their fortunes, and\r\nbecome, by a spontaneous law, their sole representatives in the face of\r\nthe world, and in the annals of its history.\r\n\r\n_Language of the Pelasgians._\r\n\r\nWe may, however, find no inconsiderable proof of the presence of a\r\nstrong Pelasgian element in the Greek nation, in that portion of the\r\nevidence upon the case which is supplied by language. Those numerous\r\nand important words in the Latin tongue, which correspond with the\r\nwords belonging to the same ideas in Greek, could only have come from\r\nthe Pelasgian ancestry common to both countries; and, if coming from\r\nthem, must demonstrate in the one case, as in the other, the strong\r\nPelasgian tincture of the nation.\r\n\r\nAnd as the language of a country cannot be extensively impregnated\r\nin this manner, except either by numbers, or by political and social\r\nascendancy (as was the case of the French tongue with the English), or\r\nby literary influence (as is now the case with us in respect to the\r\nGreek and Latin tongues), we must ask to which of these causes it was\r\nowing, that the Pelasgians so deeply marked the Greek language with the\r\ntraces of their own tongue. It was not literary influence, for we may\r\nbe sure that there existed none. It was not political ascendancy, for\r\nthey were either enslaved, or at the least subordinate. It could only\r\nbe the influence of their numbers, through which their manner of speech\r\ncould in any measure hold its ground; and thus we arrive again at the\r\nconclusion, that they must have supplied the substratum of the nation.\r\n\r\nIt is true that Herodotus, as well as Thucydides, spoke of the\r\nPelasgians as using a foreign tongue. So a German writer would\r\nnaturally describe the English, and yet the English language, by\r\none of its main ingredients, bears conclusive testimony to the Saxon\r\nelement of the English nation, and also illustrates the relative\r\npositions, which the Saxon and Norman races are known in history to\r\nhave occupied. The tongue of the Pelasgians had been subject within\r\nGreece to influence and admixture from the language of the Hellic\r\ntribes: beyond Greece it had received impressions from different\r\nsources; and naturally, after the consequences of this severance had\r\nworked for centuries, the speech of the Pelasgians would be barbarous\r\nin the eyes of the Greeks. Again, Marsh[389] observes that, in the very\r\nchapter where he distinguishes Pelasgic from Hellenic, Herodotus (i.\r\n56) declares the Ionians to belong to one of these stocks, the Dorians\r\nto the other: both of which populations were in his time undoubtedly\r\nGreek. And the historian gives another strong proof that the Pelasgians\r\nwere Greek, where he assigns to this parentage (ii. 52) the Greek name\r\nof the gods: θεοὺς δὲ προσωνόμασάν σφεας ἀπὸ τοῦ τοιούτου, ὅτι κόσμῳ\r\nθέντες τὰ πάντα πρήγματα κ.τ.λ.\r\n\r\nEven if we suppose, as may have been the case, that the Pelasgi\r\nmentioned by Herodotus, and by Thucydides, spoke a tongue as far from\r\nthe Greek actually known to either of them, as is German from the\r\nEnglish language at the present day, yet by its affinities that tongue\r\nmight still remain a conclusive proof, that the ancestors of those who\r\nspoke it must have formed an essential ingredient in the composition\r\nof the nation. The evidence, which we know to be good in the one case,\r\nmight be equally valid in the other.\r\n\r\nThere is abundance of testimony among authors, both Greek and Roman,\r\nto establish the relation of the Pelasgi to the old forms of the\r\nlanguage of both countries. It is enough for the present to refer to\r\nthe Second Chapter of Bishop Marsh’s Horæ Pelasgicæ for a very able\r\nand satisfactory discussion of the question. I shall presently have to\r\nconsider the particular complexion of the words which the Greek nation\r\nappear to have derived from Pelasgic sources, and the inferences which\r\nthat complexion suggests. But this will best be done, when we have\r\nexamined into the Homeric import of the Hellenic and Pelasgian proper\r\nnames.\r\n\r\n_Pelasgian route into Greece._\r\n\r\nWe have next to examine the question,\r\n\r\nBy what route is it most probable that this Pelasgian nation came into\r\nGreece?\r\n\r\nOn this subject there can hardly be any other than one of two\r\nsuppositions: the first, that by Thrace, or by the islands of the\r\nnorth, they reached Thessaly: the other, that they crossed from Asia,\r\nto the south of the Ægean, by the islands which divide the spaces of\r\nthat sea.\r\n\r\nIt is observed by Cramer[390], that the prevailing opinion among those\r\nancient writers, who have discussed the subject, places the Pelasgians\r\nfirst in the Peloponnesus: this being maintained by Pherecydes,\r\nEphorus, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, and Pausanias, without any\r\ndissentients to oppose them. This tradition evidently favours the\r\nopinion of a passage by the south.\r\n\r\nDionysius, who may be regarded as summing up the general results of\r\nGreek tradition, says[391] it placed the Pelasgians first in the\r\nPeloponnesus as autochthons; and represented them as having migrated\r\nto Thessaly in the sixth generation. In six generations more, they\r\nwere, he conceives, expelled by the Ætolians and Locrians, then\r\ncalled Curetes and Leleges, and were dispersed into various quarters:\r\nindeed, here the tradition seems to become wholly vague or mythical,\r\nand to have gathered into one mass most of the places in which there\r\nappeared signs of Pelasgic occupancy: it includes the report of a great\r\nmigration to Italy.\r\n\r\nMarsh[392] considers Thrace as the original seat in Europe of the\r\nPelasgi; but the _data_ on which he proceeds are too narrow; they\r\nhave reference only to the islands of Lemnus, Imbrus, and Samothrace.\r\nThere is no evidence of Pelasgians on the Continent to the north of\r\nthe Ægean except what places them at a distance from Troy (τῆλε Hom.\r\nIl. xvii. 301), and if so, at a point which they may have reached from\r\nthose islands, more probably, than by the continental route. It is on\r\nthe whole more likely, however, that Pelasgians may have found their\r\nway into Greece both by the north (and if so, probably through the\r\nislands), and also by the south.\r\n\r\nHomer affords no materials for conclusively determining the question.\r\nHe gives us the Pelasgic name established in Thessaly, which favours\r\nour supposing the one passage, and likewise in Crete, which favours\r\nthe other. He gives us the Pelasgic Jove of Dodona (a very weighty\r\npiece of testimony), and the τέμενος of Ceres in Thessaly, telling\r\nrather for the first; and he likewise gives us a perceptible connection\r\nbetween Ceres and Crete, and between Jupiter and king Minos, verging\r\nto the latter. But it is to be observed that, with the exception of\r\nAttica, the chief Homeric tokens of Pelasgianism lie in Northern and in\r\nSouthern, but not in Middle, Greece: which favours the opinion, that\r\nthere may have been a double line of entry.\r\n\r\nThe extra-Homeric tradition is on the whole most favourable to the\r\nsupposition of a southern route. Hesiod makes Dodona in Thessaly\r\nPelasgian, but distinctly associates Ceres with Crete: and the Theogony\r\n(479, 80) sends Jupiter as an infant to be reared in Crete. The Hymn\r\nto Ceres, as we have seen, brings her from thence to Eleusis; and\r\nthe popular mythology in general treats that island as the cradle\r\nof Jupiter, therefore manifestly as the place from which the Greeks\r\nderived his worship. More than this; the tradition makes Peloponnesus\r\nthe seat and centre of Pelasgic power, as we see from Æschylus, who\r\nmakes Pelasgus reside in Peloponnesus, but rule as far as Macedonia.\r\nSo likewise the names both of Ἀπίη γαῖα and of Ἰασὸν Ἄργος connect\r\nthemselves originally with this part of Greece: especially when we\r\nconsider that Apis in Egypt is the sacred bull, and that agriculture,\r\nthe characteristic pursuit of the Pelasgians, was also the business of\r\noxen. Again, Herodotus[393] reports that the local tradition of Dodona\r\nassigned to that oracle an Egyptian origin; and as Dodona was Pelasgic,\r\nthis tradition somewhat favours the hypothesis of entry by the south.\r\n\r\nThere are several allusions in Homer to Crete, to Cyprus, or to both,\r\nas marking the route between Greece and Asia. Menelaus, after quitting\r\nTroy, and nearing Crete (Od. iii. 285-92), sailed afar\r\n\r\n    Κύπρον Φοινίκην τε καὶ Αἰγυπτίους ἐπαληθεῖς[394].\r\n\r\nThe pseudo-Ulysses sails from Crete to Egypt[395], and returns\r\nthence to Phœnicia, in one tale, and afterwards starts for Libya by\r\nCrete; in another legend, he is given over from Egypt to Cyprus; and\r\nAntinous[396], in the Seventeenth Odyssey, replying to the supposed\r\nbeggar-man, says, Get out of the way,\r\n\r\n    μὴ τάχα πικρὴν Αἴγυπτον καὶ Κύπρον ἵκηαι.\r\n\r\nWe already know the connection of Crete with Greece from the Iliad: and\r\nthus it appears as on the high road from Greece to Phœnicia, and by\r\nPhœnicia to Egypt. The unexampled populousness of that island would,\r\nas a matter of course, beget migration; and, of all the tracts lying\r\nto the west of the Ægean, the Thessalian plain would, from its extent,\r\noffer perhaps the greatest encouragement to agricultural settlers.\r\nThe traditions reported by Herodotus from Dodona connect that place\r\nclosely with Egypt and the East, and the route now supposed by Crete\r\nestablishes that connection in what is probably the simplest and most\r\nobvious line.\r\n\r\nThe continental country from Thessaly to the north and east was held\r\nas it would appear to a great extent by a martial and highland race\r\nΘρῇκες and Θρηίκιοι. It is not likely that the Pelasgians had much\r\nin common with that people, or could make their way to Greece either\r\nwith or in despite of them. Perhaps the coast where we find Cicones\r\nand Pæones apart from the Thracians, may have afforded a route, and we\r\nmust remember the traditional traces of them both on the coast of the\r\nHellespont and in the islands[397].\r\n\r\nThis may be the place most convenient for observing, that there can\r\nbe little hesitation in regarding the northern route as that by which\r\nthe Hellic tribes came into Greece. They, a highland people, came\r\nalong a mountain country. They left their name upon the Hellespont,\r\nthe sea of Helle, which means not the mere strait so called in later\r\ntimes, but the whole northern Ægean[398]; and upon the river Selleeis,\r\nwhich discharges itself into the sea of Marmora. We first hear of them\r\nin Homer at the extreme north of Thessaly: then we find them giving\r\ntheir name, Hellas, to that country, or to some part of it. The people\r\nof Hellas, when their connection with their sires of the mountain had\r\nbecome faint in comparison with their relation to the territory they\r\noccupied, called themselves Hellenes, from the region they inhabited;\r\nand lost sight, as it were, of the ruder parent tribe. In the meantime,\r\nthey had struck out offshoots through Greece, and the name Hellas had,\r\nas will be seen[399], probably come, even in the time of Homer, to be\r\napplied in a secondary and comprehensive sense to the whole northern\r\nand central parts of it.\r\n\r\n_Peloponnesus the seat of power._\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable and undeniable, with reference both to Pelasgic and\r\nto Hellenic times, that in whatever part of the country ruling tribes\r\nor families might first make their appearance, the permanent seat of\r\npower for Greece was uniformly in the Peloponnesus. Every movement\r\nof political importance appears to direct itself thither, and there\r\nto rest in equilibrium. The old tradition of Pelasgus, the dynasties\r\nof Danaids, Perseids, and Pelopids, the great Heraclid and Doric\r\ninvasion, evidently aiming at laying hold on the centre of dominion,\r\nand yet more, that Spartan primacy (ἡγεμονία), which endured for so\r\nmany centuries, all tell the same tale; finally the train of evidence\r\nis crowned by the strong local sympathies of Juno. It was only in\r\nthe fifth century before the Christian era that Athens acquired the\r\nlead: nor did she keep it long. Her sway, after an interval, was\r\nfollowed by another shortlived ascendancy, that of Thebes, in the\r\nfourth century. But Greece ended as she had begun: and the last\r\nsplendours of her national sentiment and military courage were flung\r\nfrom its pristine seats in Peloponnesus: from Lacedæmon, and Achaia.\r\nThe old Amphictyonic Union alone remained, throughout the historic\r\ntimes of Greece, to bear witness to the fact that it was in the north\r\nof the Isthmus, and above all in Thessaly, that the Hellic tribes\r\nfirst organised themselves as distinct political integers, united\r\nin substance, if not in form, in respect of their common religious\r\nworship, and their common blood.\r\n\r\nIt was probably greater security, which gave this advantage, in\r\nearly times, to Southern over Northern and Midland Greece. Only one\r\nnarrow neck of land led into the Peloponnesus, and that passage was\r\nso circuitous, or dangerous, or both, that it was not the highway of\r\nimmigrant tribes, who seem usually to have crossed the Corinthian gulf\r\ninto Elis. This tract of land had not indeed the whole, but it had\r\nmuch, of the advantage enjoyed by England. It was not quite, but it was\r\nalmost,\r\n\r\n    A precious stone, set in the silver sea,\r\n    Which serves it in the office of a wall,\r\n    Or as a moat defensive to a house[400].\r\n\r\nWhen reached, it was the highway to nothing. The fat lands of Bœotia\r\nwere a road onwards for all who came from Thessaly: there was here a\r\nchoice between barrenness and poverty, on the one hand, like those of\r\nAttica in early times, and insecurity of tenure in the rich soils,\r\nwhich were the object of desire to each tribe as it went upon its\r\nmarch. The Peloponnesus was richer than the one, far more secure than\r\nthe other: it throve accordingly; and in the Trojan war this small\r\nterritory supplied four hundred and thirty ships, probably including\r\nthe greatest number of large vessels, while the other two divisions of\r\ncontinental Greece together gave no more than five hundred and thirty.\r\nAnd it seems to have had altogether a more vigorous and concentrated\r\npolitical organisation; for while the five hundred and thirty were in\r\nfifteen divisions, under twenty-six leaders, the Peloponnesian force\r\nwas in six divisions, under nine leaders only, and of the six three at\r\nleast, namely, those of Mycenæ, Lacedæmon, and Arcadia, were virtually\r\nunder the direct command of Agamemnon.\r\n\r\n_Derivation of the Pelasgian name._\r\n\r\nVarious derivations have been suggested for the name of the Pelasgi.\r\nSome will have it to come from Peleg, mentioned in the tenth chapter\r\nof Genesis, whose name, said to mean division, is taken to allude to\r\nthe partition of the earth’s surface among the various tribes of the\r\nhuman race. Marsh well observes, that this amounts to no more than\r\npossibility: that the meaning of the word will not serve to attach\r\nit to the Pelasgi in particular, as in the early ages of the world\r\nmigration, with partition and repartition, was a continuous process:\r\nand that, even if true, it tells us nothing of them antecedent to their\r\nEuropean settlement[401]: nothing, that is to say, of a material kind,\r\nexcept what we know independently of it, viz. their being, in common\r\nwith all other races, of eastern origin. Clinton gives other reasons\r\nfor rejecting this etymology[402], while he sees force in the reference\r\nof the names of Iapetus and Ion to Japheth and Javan respectively.\r\nIt seems plain that we could not safely build upon even a complete\r\nsimilarity of name, in a case where the interval of time that separates\r\nPeleg and Pelasgi, the terms we are to compare, is so vast and so\r\nobscure.\r\n\r\nSo also the name πελαργοὶ, meaning storks, has been taken to be the\r\nfoundation of Πελασγοί; and the explanation has been given, that the\r\nstork is a migratory bird, and that the Pelasgi were called after it\r\non account of their wanderings.\r\n\r\nThis explanation, which seems worse than the former, rests in part\r\nupon a statement of Herodotus misconstrued. He calls the Dorians ἔθνος\r\nπουλυπλάνητον κάρτα[403], and this has been erroneously applied to the\r\nPelasgians, of whom, on the contrary, he says, οὐδαμῆ κω ἐξεχώρησε.\r\nThis statement from a writer of the age of Herodotus, fully neutralises\r\nthe statement of Dionysius, who describes them as itinerant, and never\r\nsecurely settled[404]. He may, indeed, mean no more than Thucydides\r\nmeans, when he says (i. 2), that the occupants of good soils were\r\nthe most liable to dispossession. But does this idea of itinerancy\r\ncorrespond with the migrations of the stork, which seem to have\r\nreference to the steady periodical variations of climate, and to be as\r\nfar as possible from the idea implied in ‘much-roving?’\r\n\r\nIt appears to have been the understood characteristic of that bird,\r\nto draw to and dwell about the settled habitations of men. It seems\r\nhighly improbable, and without precedent, that a widely spread nation\r\nshould take its name from a bird: but may not the bird have taken its\r\nname from the nation? If it were a nation emphatically of settlers,\r\nas opposed to pirates, robbers, nomads, and rovers of all kinds,\r\ndwelling with comfort in fixed abodes, as opposed to the ἀνιπτόποδες\r\nχαμαίευναι[405], might not birds, which seemed to share these\r\nsettlements, be reasonably named after the people?\r\n\r\nIt by no means appears as if Aristophanes, in the passage where\r\nhe uses the term, intended a mere pun. It is in the comedy of the\r\nBirds[406], and is an allusion to that law of the Athenians, evidently\r\nhere signified under the name of storks, which required children to\r\nprovide for their parents[407]. The passage is clearly a testimony to\r\nthe Pelasgic origin of the Athenians: and it may be based upon the\r\nbelief, that the storks took their name from the Pelasgi, and that\r\nthe similarity lay in their habit of settling on the roofs of houses\r\nand the like, almost as if inhabitants, in the villages of which the\r\nPelasgi were the first Greek founders. It also gives room for the\r\nconjecture that Πελαργοὶ may have been the old form of the name.\r\nThe stork, it may be remembered, was one of the sacred birds of the\r\nEgyptians.\r\n\r\nAgain, the word πέλαγος has been suggested as supplying the true\r\nderivation of the Pelasgian name. Marsh[408] rejects it, because he\r\nconceives it is founded upon the hypothesis that the Pelasgi came\r\nacross the Ægean, which he thinks improbable. But the evidence appears\r\nto be in favour of their having come principally by the islands, if\r\nnot at once across the Ægean. It may also be questioned, whether the\r\netymology must rest on this hypothesis exclusively. For, in the first\r\nplace, the more natural construction would be, not that they came by\r\nsea, but that they came _from beyond sea_, an idea which might very\r\nwell attach to any people of Asiatic origin. So it was that the too\r\nfamous Pelagius, who is known to have been a Welshman, came by his\r\nclassical name; a name bearing that very signification[409]. But\r\nis it not also possible, that πέλαγος may at one time have had the\r\nmeaning of a plain? It properly signifies a wide open level surface,\r\ncorresponding with the Latin _æquor_, and with our _main_. Hence Homer\r\nnever attaches to the word πέλαγος any of his usual epithets for\r\nthe sea, such as οἴνοψ, ἠχηεὶς, μεγακήτης, ἀτρύγετος, πολύφλοισβος;\r\nbut only μέγα, great: and he uses the phrase ἅλος ἐν πελάγεσσι[410],\r\nwhich would be mere tautology, if πέλαγος properly and directly meant\r\nthe sea. So Pindar has πόντιον πέλαγος, Æschylus ἃλς πελαγία, and\r\nApollonius Rhodius πέλαγος θαλάσσης[411]. There were in Macedonia, as\r\nwe learn from Strabo, a people called Pelagones[412], and in Homer\r\nwe find the names Πελάγων and Πηλέγων. Again, we have in Hesychius,\r\namong the meanings of πελαγίζειν, ψεύδεσθαι μεγάλα, and for πέλαγος he\r\ngives μέγεθος, πλῆθος, βύθος; as well as πλάτος θαλάσσης. It seems not\r\nimpossible that the Pelasgi may owe their name to the word πέλαγος, in\r\nits primary sense of plain and open surface: as the word Θρῇξ, in this\r\nview its exact counterpart, was derived from τρῆχυς, and at one time\r\nmeant simply the inhabitant of a rough and rocky place, a mountaineer\r\nor highlander.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, another mode in which Πελασγοὶ may bear the sense of\r\ninhabitants of the plain, or rather (for it is in this that the word\r\nwill most comprehensively apply to them, and most closely keep to its\r\nproper meaning), of the cultivable country, which would include valleys\r\nas well as plains properly so called: and indeed this derivation,\r\nsuggested by K. O. Müller, is the simplest possible, if only we can\r\nclear the first step, which _assumes_ the identity of Πελασγοὶ and\r\nΠελαργοί. He says it is compounded of πέλω and ἄργος. The first meaning\r\nof πέλω seems to imply motion with repetition or custom. Afterwards it\r\nis _to be_, and especially _to be wont to be_. Thus it will, while yet\r\nvery near its fountain, have the sense, _to frequent_ or _inhabit_.\r\nTo the same origin he refers πόλις, πολέω; and also the πελώρια, the\r\nharvest feast of Thessaly, taken as the feast of inhabitation[413] or\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nThe subject of this name will again come into view, when the later\r\nname of Ἀργεῖοι is examined. In the mean time, let it be observed,\r\nthat if the Pelasgi were thus called from being, or if only they in\r\nfact were, inhabitants of the plains, we find in this some further\r\nexplanation of the tradition, which can hardly have been an unmixed\r\nerror, of their vagrant character. For the plains contained the most\r\nfertile soils: and, especially as they were of limited extent, their\r\ninhabitants could not but rapidly increase, so as to require more space\r\nfor the support of their population. Further, these rich tracts offered\r\na prize to all the tribes who were in want of settlements; according\r\nto the just observation of Thucydides[414], already quoted, that the\r\nmost fertile parts of Greece, namely, Bœotia, Thessaly, and much of\r\nPeloponnesus, most frequently changed hands. This would be more and\r\nmore applicable to a given people, in proportion as it might be more\r\naddicted to peaceful pursuits. Manifestly, it is as inhabitants of the\r\nplains, or the cultivable country, that Homer especially marks the\r\nPelasgi: both by calling the great plain of Thessaly Pelasgic, and by\r\nthe epithet ἐριβώλαξ which he applies (Il. ii. 841, and xvii. 301), to\r\ntheir Larissa, on the only two occasions when he mentions it. And the\r\netymological inquiry seems, upon the whole, to direct us, although the\r\nparticular path be somewhat uncertain, towards a similar conclusion.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[276] Il. xiv. 321.\r\n\r\n[277] Od. xix. 178.\r\n\r\n[278] Od. xi. 568-71.\r\n\r\n[279] Cf.

IV.\r\n\r\n_On the Phœnicians, and the Outer Geography of the Odyssey._\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Phœnicians._\r\n\r\nThe text of Homer appears to afford presumptions, if not of close\r\naffinity between the Phœnician and Hellenic races, yet of close\r\ncongeniality, and of great capacity for amalgamation; although the\r\nformer were of Semitic origin.\r\n\r\nThe Phœnician name, as may be seen from Strabo, was widely spread\r\nthrough Greece: even in Homer we find the word Φοίνιξ already used, (1)\r\nfor a Phœnician, (2) for a Greek proper name, (3) for purple, and (4)\r\nfor the palm tree (Od. v. 163).\r\n\r\nWe find the ancient family of Cadmus established as a dynasty in\r\nBœotia, about the same time, according to the common opinion, with\r\nthe earliest appearances of the Hellenic race in the Greek peninsula.\r\nWe have no reason to suppose that they were themselves of Hellic\r\nextraction: but we find them invested with the same marks of political\r\nsuperiority as the Hellenic families, and figuring among the Greek\r\nsovereigns in successive generations. They must have ejected previous\r\noccupants: for Amphion and Zethus first settled and fortified Thebes,\r\nand they were the sons of Jupiter and Antiope[415].\r\n\r\nIno Leucothee, the daughter of Cadmus, was already a deity in the time\r\nof Homer. She appears in that capacity to Ulysses, when he is tossed\r\nupon the waters between Ogygia and Phæacia; that is to say, when he\r\nwas still beyond the limits of the Greek or Homeric world, and within\r\nthe circle of those traditions, lying in the unknown distance, which\r\nthe Greeks could only derive from the most experienced and daring\r\nnavigators of the time; namely, the Phœnicians. This appears to mark\r\nIno herself, and therefore her father Cadmus, as of Phœnician birth.\r\nAnd accordingly we may set down the position of this family in Greece,\r\nas the earliest token of relations between Phœnicia and Greece.\r\n\r\nIt is followed by one more significant still, and more clearly attested\r\nin Homer. Minos, a Phœnician, appears in Crete and founds an empire:\r\nhe marries his daughter Ariadne to the Athenian hero Theseus; and so\r\nquickly does this empire assume the national character, that in the\r\ntime of the _Troica_, Hellenic races are established in the island, the\r\nCretan troops are numbered without distinction among the followers of\r\nAgamemnon; and Idomeneus, only the grandson of Minos, appears to be as\r\nGrecian as any of the other chiefs of the army. The grandfather himself\r\nis appointed to act as judge over the shades of Greeks in the nether\r\nworld[416]: and his brother Rhadamanthus has a post of great dignity,\r\nif of inferior responsibility, in being intrusted with the police of\r\nElysium[417].\r\n\r\nNowhere is Homer’s precision more remarkable, than in the numerous\r\npassages where he appears before us as a real geographer or\r\ntopographer. Indeed, by virtue of this accuracy, he enables us to\r\ndefine with considerable confidence the sphere of his knowledge and\r\nexperience; by which I mean not only the countries and places he had\r\nvisited, but those with respect to which he had habitual information\r\nfrom his countrymen, and unrestricted opportunities of correcting\r\nerror. In the direction of the west, it seems plain that he knew\r\nnothing except the coast of Greece and the coastward islands. Phæacia\r\nhangs doubtfully upon his horizon, and it is probable that he had only\r\na very general and vague idea of its position. Towards the north, there\r\nis nothing to imply, that his experimental knowledge reached beyond the\r\nThracian coast and, at the farthest, the Sea of Marmora. He speaks of\r\nIda, as if its roots and spurs comprised the whole district, of which\r\nin that quarter he could speak with confidence[418]. To the east, he\r\nprobably knew no region beyond Lycia on the coast of Asia Minor, and to\r\nthe south Crete was probably his boundary: though he was aware, by name\r\nat least, of the leading geographical points of a maritime passage, not\r\nwholly unfrequented, to the almost unknown regions of Cyprus, Phœnicia,\r\nand Egypt. The apparent inconsistency however of his statements[419]\r\nrespecting the voyage to Egypt, affords proof that it lay beyond the\r\ngeographical circle, within which we are to consider that his familiar\r\nknowledge and that of his nation lay.\r\n\r\nWhile he is within that circle, he is studious alike of the distances\r\nbetween places, the forms of country, and the physical character of\r\ndifferent districts: but, when he passes beyond it, he emancipates\r\nhimself from the laws of space. The points touched in the voyage\r\nof Ulysses are wholly irreconcilable with actual geography, though\r\nnational partialities have endeavoured to identify them with a view to\r\nparticular appropriation. Some of them, indeed, we may conceive that he\r\nmentally associated with places that had been described to him: nay, he\r\nmay have intended it in all: but the dislocated knowledge, which alone\r\neven the navigators of the age would possess, has suffered, by intent\r\nor accident, such further derangement in its transfer to the mind of\r\nHomer, that it is hopeless to adjust his geography otherwise than by a\r\nfree and large infusion of fictitious drawing. This outer sphere is,\r\nhowever, peopled with imagery of deep interest. For the purposes of\r\nthe poem, the whole wanderings both of Menelaus and Ulysses lie within\r\nit, and beyond the limits of ordinary Greek experience. And throughout\r\nthese wanderings the language of Homer is that of a poet who, as to\r\nfacts, was at the mercy of unsifted information; of information which\r\nhe must either receive from a source not liable to check or scrutiny,\r\nor else not receive at all: and who wisely availed himself of that\r\ncharacter of the marvellous with which the whole was overspread, to\r\nwork it up into pictures of the imagination, which were to fill both\r\nhis contemporaries and all succeeding generations with emotions of\r\ninterest and wonder.\r\n\r\n_Limits of Greek navigation._\r\n\r\nIn Homer we find that Greek navigation already extends, yet it is very\r\nslightly, beyond the limits of Greek settlement. The Pseudo-Ulysses of\r\nthe Fourteenth Odyssey made nine voyages[420], ἀνδρὰς ἐς ἀλλοδάπους;\r\nand at length, inspired as he says by a wild impulse from on high,\r\nhe planned and executed a voyage to Egypt. But he is represented\r\nas a Cretan, and the early fame of Crete in navigation is probably\r\ndue to its connection through Minos with Phœnicia. Here too the\r\nrepresentation is, that he is a Cretan of the highest class, the\r\ncolleague of Idomeneus in his command[421], and thus, according to the\r\nlaw of poetical likelihood, to be understood as probably of a family\r\nbelonging to the Phœnician train of Minos. The Thesprotian ship of the\r\nFourteenth Odyssey trades for corn to Dulichium only. The Taphians,\r\nindeed, who from the xenial relation of their lord, Mentes[422], to\r\nUlysses, must in all likelihood have lived in the neighbourhood of\r\nIthaca, are represented as making voyages not only to an unknown\r\nTemese, which was in foreign parts (ἐπ’ ἀλλοθρόους ἀνθρώπους[423]), but\r\nlikewise to Phœnicia; the latter voyage, however, is only mentioned in\r\nconnection with the purpose of piracy[424]. But these Taphians appear\r\nto have formed an insignificant exception to the general rule: we do\r\nnot hear any thing of them in the great armament of the Iliad. Speaking\r\ngenerally, we may say that the Achæans had no foreign navigation: it\r\nwas in the hands of the Phœnicians.\r\n\r\n_The Outer Geography Phœnician._\r\n\r\nIt is to that people that we must look as the established merchants,\r\nhardiest navigators, and furthest explorers, of those days. To them\r\nalone as a body, in the whole Homeric world of flesh and blood, does\r\nHomer give the distinctive epithet of ναυσικλυτοὶ ἄνδρες[425]. He\r\naccords it indeed to the airy Phæacians, but in all probability that\r\nelement of their character is borrowed from the Phœnicians[426], and\r\nif so, the reason of the derivation can only be, that the Phœnicians\r\nwere for that age the type of a nautical people. To them only does he\r\nassign the epithets, which belong to the knavery of trade, namely,\r\nπολυπαίπαλοι and τρωκταί. When we hear of their ships in Egypt or\r\nin Greece, the circumstance is mentioned as if their coming was in\r\nthe usual course of their commercial operations. Some force also, in\r\nrespect to national history, may be assigned to the general tradition,\r\nwhich almost makes the Mediterranean of the heroic age ‘a Phœnician\r\nlake:’ to their settlements in Spain, and the strong hold they took\r\nupon that country; and to the indirect Homeric testimony, as well as\r\nthe judgment of Thucydides, respecting the maritime character of the\r\nMinoan empire.\r\n\r\nAgain, Homer knew of a class of merchants whom he calls πρηκτῆρες\r\nin the Eighth Odyssey (v. 152). But where Eumæus enumerates the\r\nδημιόεργοι, or ‘trades and professions’ of a Greek community, there are\r\nno πρηκτῆρες among them[427]. Again, as the poet knew of the existence\r\nof this class on earth, so he introduced them into his Olympian heaven,\r\nwhere gain and increase had their representative in Mercury. From\r\nwhence could the prototype have been derived, except from intercourse\r\nwith the Phœnicians?\r\n\r\nBut the imaginative geography of the Odyssey goes far beyond the\r\npoints, with which Homer has so much at least of substantive\r\nacquaintance, as to associate them historically with the commerce or\r\npolitics of the age. The habitations of the Cyclops, the Læstrygones,\r\nthe Lotophagi, of Æolus, the Sirens, Calypso, and Circe, may have\r\nhad no ‘whereabout,’ no actual site, outside the fancy of Homer;\r\nstill they must have been imagined as repositories in which to lodge\r\ntraditions which had reached him, and which, however fabulously\r\ngiven, purported to be local. Again, with respect to the tradition\r\nof Atlas, it is scarcely possible to refuse to it a local character.\r\nHe knows the depths of every sea, and he holds or keeps the pillars\r\nthat hold heaven and earth apart. This must not be confounded with the\r\nlater representations of Atlas carrying the globe, or with his more\r\npurely geographical character, as representing the mountain ranges of\r\nNorthern Africa. Here he appears[428] as the keeper of the great gate\r\nof the outer waters, namely, of the Straits of Gibraltar: that great\r\ngate being probably the point of connection with the ocean, and that\r\nouter sea being frequented exclusively by the Phœnicians, who in all\r\nlikelihood obtained from Cornwall the tin used in making the Shield of\r\nAgamemnon, or in any of the metal manufactures of the period. Rocks\r\nrising on each side of a channel at the extreme point of the world, as\r\nit was known to Greek experience, or painted in maritime narrative,\r\ncould not be represented more naturally than as the pillars which hold\r\nup the sky. This figure follows the analogy of the pillars and walls\r\nof a house, supporting the roof, and placed at the extremities of the\r\ninterior of its great apartment[429]. With equal propriety, those who\r\nare believed alone to have reached this remote quarter, and to frequent\r\nit, would be said to hold those pillars[430].\r\n\r\nEven in a less imaginative age than that of Homer, the love of the\r\nmarvellous, both by the givers and by the receivers of information,\r\nwould act powerfully in colouring all narratives, of which the scene\r\nwas laid in tracts unknown except to the narrator. But a more powerful\r\nmotive might be found in that spirit of monopoly, which is so highly\r\ncharacteristic of the earlier stages, in particular, of the development\r\nof commerce[431]. To clothe their relations in mystery and awe, by the\r\naid both of natural and supernatural wonders, would be, for a people\r\npossessed of an exclusive navigation, a powerful means of deterring\r\ncompetitors, and of maintaining secure hold upon profits either\r\nlegitimate or piratical.\r\n\r\nWe have before us these facts in evidence: on the one hand, a people\r\nwho in maritime enterprise had far surpassed all others, and had a\r\nvirtual monopoly of the knowledge of the waters and countries lying\r\nbeyond a certain narrow circle. Then, on the other hand, we have\r\na multitude of adventures laid by Homer in this outer sphere, and\r\nassociated wholly with the persons and places that belong to it. Upon\r\nthese grounds it seems hardly possible to avoid the conclusion, that\r\nthe Phœnicians must have been the people from whom Homer drew, whether\r\ndirectly or mediately, his information respecting the outer circle of\r\nthe geography of the Odyssey. Such is the judgment of Strabo. He says\r\nτοὺς δὲ Φοίνικας λέγω μηνυτάς; he considers that even before the time\r\nof Homer they were masters of the choice parts of Spain and Africa: and\r\nit appears that the traces of their colonization remained until his\r\nday[432].\r\n\r\n_Traditions of the Outer Geography._\r\n\r\nBut further; the traditions themselves bear other unequivocal marks,\r\nbesides their lying in parts known to Phœnicians only, of a Phœnician\r\ncharacter; and whether these marks were attached by Homer, or came\r\nready made into his hands, has no bearing upon the present argument.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the tradition of Atlas; and of the likelihood that\r\nthe Phœnicians would cast a veil over the regions of which they knew\r\nthe profitable secrets. In conformity with these ideas, the island of\r\nOgygia is the island of Calypso, the Concealer: and this Calypso is the\r\ndaughter of Atlas.\r\n\r\nPhæacia is, in the Odyssey, the geographical middle term between the\r\ndiscovered and the undiscovered world; Ogygia is the stage beyond\r\nit, and the stage on this side of it is Ithaca. I do not understand\r\nthe Phæacians to be a portrait of the Phœnicians[433]: but the very\r\nresemblance of name is enough to show that Homer had this people in\r\nhis eye when he endowed his ethereal islanders with the double gift,\r\nfirst, of unrivalled nautical excellence, and, secondly, of forming the\r\nmedium of communication between the interior space bounded by the Greek\r\nhorizon, and the parts which lay beyond it.\r\n\r\n_Minos the ὀλοόφρων._\r\n\r\nBut in many instances we find Homer’s peculiar and characteristic use\r\nof epithets the surest guide to his meaning. Now in Minos we have,\r\naccording to Homer, a firmly grounded point of contact with Phœnicia.\r\nOf Minos, as the friend of Jupiter, and the Judge of the defunct, we\r\nmust from the poems form a favourable impression. Yet is Ariadne Μίνωος\r\nθυγάτηρ ὀλοόφρονος. What is the meaning of the word ὀλοόφρων? I think\r\nan examination of the use of kindred words will show, that in the mind\r\nof Homer it does not mean anything actually wicked or criminal, but\r\nhard, rigid, inexorable; or astute, formidable to cope with, one who\r\ntakes merciless advantage, who holds those with whom he deals to the\r\nletter of the bond; and, in consequence, often entails on them heavy\r\ndetriment.\r\n\r\nIn this view, it would be an epithet natural and appropriate for a\r\npeople, who represented commerce at a time when it so frequently\r\npartook of the characters of unscrupulous adventure, war, and plunder;\r\nand an epithet which might pass to Minos as one of the great figures\r\nin their history, or as a conqueror. Again, it is worth while to\r\nreview Homer’s use of the adjective ὀλοός. This epithet is applied by\r\nhim to the lion, the boar, and the water-snake[434]. Achilles, when\r\ncomplaining of Apollo for having drawn him away from the Trojan wall,\r\ncalls him θεῶν ὀλοώτατε πάντων[435]. Menelaus, combating with Paris,\r\nwhen his sword breaks in his hand, complains of Jupiter that no god\r\nis ὀλοώτερος[436]. Philætius, in the Twentieth Odyssey, astonished\r\nthat Jupiter does not take better care of good men, uses the same\r\nwords[437]. And Menelaus applies the same epithet to Antilochus, who\r\nhas stolen an advantage over him in the chariot-race[438]. In the\r\npositive degree, it is applied to old age, fire, fate, night, battle,\r\nto Charybdis (Od. xii. 113), and even to the hostile intentions of a\r\ngod, such as the ὀλοὰ φρονέων of Apollo (Il. xvi. 701), and in θεῶν\r\nὀλοὰς διὰ βουλὰς (Od. xi. 275).\r\n\r\nBut the characteristic force of the epithet applied to Minos becomes\r\nmost clear, and its effect in stamping a Phœnician character upon\r\ncertain traditions undeniable, when we examine the remaining instances\r\nof its use; and likewise that of the cognate, indeed nearly synonymous,\r\nphrase ὀλοφώïα εἰδώς.\r\n\r\nOnly two persons besides Minos receive in Homer the epithet\r\nὀλοόφρων[439]. One of them is Atlas, the father of Calypso: the other\r\nis Æetes, the brother of Circe. Again, the phrase ὀλοφώïα εἰδὼς\r\nis applied to Proteus[440]; and it is used nowhere else except by\r\nMelanthius, where he means to describe Eumæus as a person dangerous\r\nand to be suspected[441]. Again, the ὀλοφώïα of Proteus are his\r\ntricks[442]: and moreover we have the ὀλοφώïα δήνεα of Circe[443].\r\nThus it would appear that Homer virtually confines these epithets\r\nwithin one particular circle of traditions; for Proteus, Æetes, Circe,\r\nAtlas, all belong to the Outer Geography of the Odyssey[444]: and the\r\nuse of one of them for Minos, with his already presumable Phœnician\r\nextraction[445], leads us, in concurrence with many other signs, to\r\nconclude that the epithet is strictly characteristic, and the circle\r\nof traditions Phœnician. One of the slightest, is also perhaps one of\r\nthe most curious and satisfactory signs of the Phœnicianism of the\r\nwhole scheme. Tiresias is employed in the Eleventh Odyssey to predict\r\nto Ulysses his coming fortunes: and in doing it he uses many of the\r\nvery lines, which are afterwards prophetically spoken by Circe. Now\r\nwhy is Tiresias made the informant of Ulysses? He is nowhere else\r\nmentioned in the poems; yet he is introduced here, in possession of\r\nthe only gift of prophecy permitted in the nether world. Why have we\r\nnot rather Amphiaraus, or Polupheides, those Seers at the top of all\r\nmortal renown[446]? Surely there can be but one reason; namely, that\r\nTiresias was a Theban, a native of the only Greek State, except Crete,\r\nwhere he could have been the subject of a Phœnician dynasty[447]. It\r\nwas doubtless this Phœnician connection, which qualified him to speak\r\nof regions, of which a Greek Seer would, in right of his nation, have\r\npossessed no knowledge.\r\n\r\nNor is it only upon the epithets that we may rely; but upon the\r\ncharacters, too, of those to whom they are appropriated. They are full\r\nof the elements of cunning and deception. Proteus, Circe, Calypso,\r\nthe Sirens, the Læstrygones, the Cyclopes, all partake of this\r\nelement, while in some it is joined with violence, and in others\r\nwith refinement or sensuality. In all of these we recognise so many\r\nvariations of the one Phœnician type.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed, that Virgil seems to recognise Proteus as an\r\neastern counterpart of Atlas, in the lines\r\n\r\n  Atrides Protei Menelaus ad usque columnas, &c.\r\n\r\nThis is a recognition by Virgil of the Phœnician character of the\r\ntradition: but I see no evidence that Homer meant to place Proteus and\r\nAtlas in relations to one another as representing the East and West of\r\nthe Mediterranean, though this theory is adopted by Nägelsbach[448] and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe office of the god Mercury, and his relationship to Calypso, will be\r\nfound to confirm these conclusions[449].\r\n\r\n_Commercial aptitude of modern Greeks._\r\n\r\nThe moral signs of the Greek character, though not identical with\r\nthose of the Phœnician, yet establish a resemblance between them; in\r\nso far that both possessed vigour, hardihood, and daring, and that\r\nthe intelligence, which directed and sustained these great qualities,\r\nwas susceptible of alliance with craft. In the censure upon the\r\nπρηκτῆρες, which Homer has conveyed through the mouth of Euryalus,\r\nwe may read a genuine effusion of his own nature: but the gifts of\r\nMercury to Autolycus appear to show, that the Phœnician character\r\neasily amalgamated with the Greek by its cunning, as well as by its\r\nstrength. And certainly we may well marvel at the tenacity of tissue,\r\nwith which these characters were formed, when we find that still, after\r\nthe lapse of three thousand years, one race is distinguished beyond\r\nall others for aptitude and energy in prosecuting the pursuits of\r\nhonourable commerce; that in England, now the centre of the trade of\r\nthe whole world, the Greeks of the present day alike excel all other\r\nforeigners who frequent her great emporia, and the children of her own\r\nenergetic and persevering people; themselves perhaps the offspring of\r\nthe Thesprotians, who went for corn to Dulichium; of the Taphians, who\r\ncarried swarthy iron to Temese; of the Cretans, who made much money in\r\nEgypt; and of the Lemnians, who obtained metals, hides, captives, and\r\neven oxen, in return for their wine, from the jovial Greeks of the army\r\nbefore Troy.\r\n\r\nThe more we attempt an examination of the geography of the Odyssey, the\r\nmore we find that, impossible as it is to reconcile with the actual\r\ndistribution of earth and sea, it has marks of being derived from the\r\nnation, who navigated in the remote waters where its scenes are laid.\r\nThe fundamental article of the whole is the circumscription of the\r\nknown seas by the great river Ocean, which, alike in the Iliad and\r\nthe Odyssey, flows round and round the earth, returning upon itself,\r\nἀψόρροος[450], like what is called an endless rope. And the two keys,\r\nas I believe, to the comprehension of it are to be found in the double\r\nhypothesis,\r\n\r\n(1) That Homer placed to the northward of Thrace, Epirus, and the\r\nItalian peninsula, an expanse, not of land, but of sea, communicating\r\nwith the Euxine. Or, to express myself in other words, that he greatly\r\nextended the Euxine westwards, perhaps also shortening it towards\r\nthe east; and that he made it communicate, by the Gulfs of Genoa and\r\nVenice, with the southern Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n(2) That he compounded into one two sets of Phœnician traditions\r\nrespecting the Ocean-mouth, and fixed the site of them in the North\r\nEast.\r\n\r\nIt would carry us too far from the line of ethnological inquiry, were\r\nI now to examine the extensive question with which these propositions\r\nare connected. I will only observe in this place, that all the features\r\nof this outer geography, when viewed at large, are of such a nature\r\nas to favour, or perhaps rather to compel, the supposition, that it\r\nwas founded on foreign, that is to say, on Phœnician information. Its\r\nextended range, its reach, by the routes of Menelaus on the one side,\r\nand of Ulysses on the other, over all the points of the compass, its\r\nvague, indeterminate, and ungeographical character as to distances and\r\ndirections, and yet its frequent, though inconsistent and confused,\r\nresemblances at almost every point to some actual prototype, of which\r\nthe poet may have had possibly or probably a vision in his eye;--all\r\nthis agrees with the belief, that it represents a highly manufactured\r\nwork, made up from Phœnician materials, and can scarcely agree with any\r\nthing else.\r\n\r\nReserving this much agitated subject for a fuller separate discussion,\r\nI will here only proceed to consider that limited portion of it which\r\nbears upon ethnology; I mean the evidence afforded us by Homer in the\r\nOdyssey, and particularly in connection with the Wanderings, as to\r\nthe site and character (1) of the Siceli and of Sicania: (2) of the\r\nThesprotians and Epirus: and (3) with respect to the family of Cadmus,\r\nwhich general tradition connects immediately with Phœnicia in the\r\nperson of its founder, and which Homer, by indirect testimony, I think,\r\njustifies us in considering as derived from that source.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Siceli and Sicania._\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding his use of the name Thrinacie, the poet appears to\r\nhave had no geographical knowledge of Sicily, at least beyond its\r\nshape; for I think it may be shown that he places the site of the\r\nisland in the immediate neighbourhood of the Bosphorus. But he might\r\nstill have heard of the eastern coast of Italy immediately adjoining,\r\nafterwards the country of the Bruttii, which forms the sole of the foot\r\nrudely described by the configuration of southern Italy. For this coast\r\nis much nearer to Greece; it probably would be taken by mariners on\r\ntheir way from Greece to Sicily, and might be visited by them before\r\nthey had pushed their explorations to the more distant point. The\r\nAthenian fleet in the Peloponnesian war touched first at the Iapygian\r\npromontory, and then coasted all the way[451]. This possibility grows\r\nnearly into a certainty, when we find that Homer speaks of a race,\r\nevidently as transmarine, which from history would appear probably to\r\nhave inhabited that region at some early period.\r\n\r\nI venture to argue that this Bruttian coast, the sole of the Italian\r\nfoot, reaching from the gulf of Tarentum down to Rhegium, is the\r\ncountry which appears to us in the Odyssey under the name of Sicania.\r\n\r\nIn the fabulous account which Ulysses gives of himself to his father\r\nLaertes before the Recognition, he speaks as follows:\r\n\r\n    εἶμι μὲν ἐξ Ἀλύβαντος, ὅθι κλυτὰ δώματα ναίω,\r\n    υἷος Ἀφείδαντος Πολυπημονίδαο ἄνακτος·\r\n    αὐτὰρ ἐμοί γ’ ὄνομ’ ἐστὶν Ἐπήριτος· ἀλλά με δαίμων\r\n    πλάγξ’ ἀπὸ Σικανίης δεῦρ’ ἐλθέμεν οὐκ ἐθέλοντα·\r\n    νηὺς δέ μοι ἥδ’ ἕστηκεν ἐπ’ ἀγροῦ νόσφι πόληος[452].\r\n\r\nIn this passage Ulysses represents himself as a mariner, driven by\r\nsome cross wind out of his course into Ithaca. Now this implies that\r\nhis point of departure should be one from which by a single change of\r\nwind he could easily be driven upon Ithaca. Again, Sicania must have\r\nbeen a region known to the Ithacans, or else, instead of merely naming\r\nit, he would have described it to Laertes, as he describes Crete to\r\nPenelope[453].\r\n\r\nNow, to fulfil these conditions, no other country than the one I have\r\nnamed is available. It has only an open sea between it and Greece, and\r\na passage of some two hundred or two hundred and fifty miles, so that\r\na wind driving him from his course might readily carry him across. And\r\nthere is no other tract on the western side of the Adriatic, which is\r\nso likely to have been intended by Homer. Iapygia, beyond the Tarentine\r\ngulf, lies northward even of Scheria; and, like Scheria, so Iapygia\r\nwas, we may be assured, in the Outer or unknown sphere of geography for\r\nHomer.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Bruttian coast might well be known in Greece,\r\nthough by dim rumour, yet better than Sicily: first, because it was\r\nnearer; and secondly, inasmuch as it did not in the same manner\r\npresent the appearance of an island, its bearings would be more easily\r\ndetermined, and therefore its site was less likely to be mistaken.\r\nLastly, history assures us that the Sicanian name prevailed in Italy,\r\nbefore it passed over into Sicily. Therefore the country of the Bruttii\r\nis in all likelihood the Homeric Sicania.\r\n\r\nBut again, we hear in Homer of Σικελοὶ, though not of a Σικελία. The\r\nSuitors advise Telemachus to send his guests to the Σικελοὶ[454] for\r\nsale: adding that a good price, a renumerating price (ἄξιον), would\r\nthus be obtained for them. On the other hand, a Sicelian female slave\r\nis the wife of Dolios, and looks after Laertes in his old age[455].\r\n\r\nFrom these passages we may infer,\r\n\r\n1. That the country of the Σικελοὶ was within the remoter knowledge of\r\nIthacan seamen.\r\n\r\n2. That they were a rich people; since they were able to pay a good\r\nprice for slaves.\r\n\r\nThe first point, as we have seen, would make the Σικελοὶ suitable\r\ninhabitants of Sicania.\r\n\r\nBut likewise as to the second, Homer has given us some indications of\r\ntheir wealth: (_a_) in the name Ἀφείδας (the open-handed) ascribed by\r\nUlysses to his father; (_b_) in that of Ἐπήριτος (object of contention)\r\nassumed for himself; (_c_) perhaps also in the name Ἀλύβας, akin to\r\nthat of Ἀλύβη[456], where there was silver, and to that of Ἀρύβας a\r\nrich Sidonian[457]. This name probably indicates the possession of\r\nmetallic mines, which for that period we may consider as a special sign\r\nof advancement and opulence.\r\n\r\nThen if we turn for a moment to the historic period, it is in this very\r\ncountry that we find planted the great and luxurious cities of Sybaris\r\nand Crotona[458].\r\n\r\nNow as the people called Siceli, and the country called Sicania, are\r\nthus placed in relations of proximity by Homer, so they continue\r\nthroughout all antiquity. The reports collected by Thucydides represent\r\nthe Sicanians as giving their name to Sicily, and displacing the former\r\nname Trinacria, which is identical with the Homeric Thrinacie. At a\r\nlater time, the Sicilians passed from Italy into Sicily, and, as was\r\nsaid, upon rafts; that is to say, across the strait, and consequently\r\nfrom the country which, as I contend, is the Homeric Sicania. These\r\nSiceli were rumoured to have overcome the Sicani, and to have again\r\nchanged the name of the island to Sicily. It is yet more material to\r\nnote, that Thucydides says there were still Siceli in Italy when he\r\nhimself lived: and he adds the tradition that Italus, a king of theirs,\r\ngave his name to the Peninsula[459].\r\n\r\nTo these reports, which form a part of the account given by Thucydides,\r\nwe may add the statement of Dionysius, that the Σικελοὶ were the oldest\r\ninhabitants of Latium, and were displaced by the Pelasgi[460]. This\r\nimplies their movement southward, and makes it probable that we should\r\nmeet them in Bruttium, on their way to Sicily, perhaps pressing, in\r\nthat region, upon the Sicani.\r\n\r\nSuch an hypothesis would be in entire agreement with Homer, who\r\nevidently represents the Sicanian as older than the Sicelian name: for\r\nthe first had become territorial, when the latter was only tribal or\r\nnational. And all this is in agreement with Thucydides in the essential\r\npoint, that he makes the Sicanians precede the Siceli: while, though\r\nthe tradition he reports brings the Sicani from Spain under pressure\r\nfrom the Ligures[461], he need not mean to exclude the supposition,\r\nthat they may have come by land down the Italian peninsula. Though it\r\nis probably wrong to confound the Siceli with the Sicani[462], it would\r\nthus on all hands appear, that they were but successive waves of the\r\ntide of immigration advancing southward.\r\n\r\nThere is a further evidence that Homer meant to place Sicania within\r\nthe Greek maritime world, and not beyond it. It is this. In his\r\nfabulous narrative to Laertes, Ulysses apprises the old man, that he\r\nhad seen his son five years before in Sicania, hopeful of reaching his\r\nhome[463]. Now this is a proof that the place was in the Inner or\r\nknown sphere of geography: for in the outer circle, as for instance at\r\nÆolia, he never has any knowledge or reckoning of his own as to the\r\npower of reaching home: it was Æolus who gave him the Zephyr to take\r\nhim home, not he who knew that if he got a Zephyr he would reach home.\r\nAnd in like manner he is supplied with express directions by Calypso:\r\nwhile Menelaus, not being absolutely beyond the known world, has no\r\ninstructions for his voyage from Proteus, who plays for him the part of\r\ndivine informant.\r\n\r\nThus then it appears, that Homer knew something of that part of the\r\nItalian continent, which we may term the sole of the foot. Again,\r\nif we look onward to the heel, Iapygia or Apulia, and observe its\r\nproximity to Corcyra or Scheria, we shall perceive that mariners in\r\nthe time of Homer might take the route, which was afterwards pursued\r\nby the Athenian fleet under Nicias and his colleagues. But this is\r\nconjectural; and as Scheria was so faintly known, we must suppose\r\nApulia to have been still more faintly conceived. Beyond Apulia Homer\r\ngives no sign of any acquaintance whatever with Italy. It therefore\r\nat once appears possible that he had no idea of the junction by land\r\nbetween the Greek and Italian peninsulas, and that he had imaged to\r\nthe northward only an expanse of sea. I postpone, however, the further\r\ndiscussion of this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Epirus and the Thesproti._\r\n\r\n_Epirus in Homer._\r\n\r\nThe Ithacan Suitors threaten to send Irus (Od. xviii. 84, 115), and\r\nagain Ulysses (Od. xxi. 307), to a certain lawless and cruel king\r\nnamed Echetus; and in the two first passages we have the additional\r\nindication ἤπειρόνδε. This expression used in Ithaca can refer to no\r\nother mainland than that of the Greek Peninsula: of which even the\r\nnearer parts[464] pass by that name.\r\n\r\nAs on the one hand Echetus is savage, and evidently foreign (for we\r\nnever find a Greek sold by Greeks as a slave to a Greek), he must be\r\nbeyond the Greek limit: doubtless beyond the Thesproti, who were allies\r\n(ἄρθμιοι, Od. xvi. 427) of Ithaca. On the other hand, he could not\r\nbe remote, or the Suitors would not have spoken so glibly of sending\r\npersons there. Hence we can hardly doubt, that this Echetus was a\r\nsovereign in the region of Epirus, between Scheria and the Thesproti:\r\nand the territorial name Ἤπειρος may thus be at least as ancient as the\r\nPoet.\r\n\r\nIn like manner we find in the Sixth Odyssey a female slave named\r\nEurymedusa, in the household of Alcinous, the old nurse of Nausicaa.\r\nShe was brought by sea Ἀπείρηθεν, and is described as γρηῢς\r\nἈπειραίη[465]. This is probably meant to indicate some part of the same\r\nregion.\r\n\r\nThus Epirus would appear to form, along with Scheria and Sicania,\r\nHomer’s line of vanishing points, or extreme limits of actual\r\ngeography, towards the north-west and west of Greece. To trace these\r\nvanishing points all round the circuit of his horizon, whenever it\r\ncan be done, is most useful towards establishing the fundamental\r\ndistinction between his Inner and Outer, his practical and poetical\r\ngeography. In order to mark that distinction more forcibly, I would, if\r\nI might venture it, even call the former of these alone Geography, and\r\nthe latter his territorial Skiagraphy.\r\n\r\nMore nearly within the circle of every day intercourse with Greece than\r\nthe barbarous Echetus and his Epirus, and yet hovering near the verge\r\nof it, are the Thesprotians of the Odyssey.\r\n\r\nUlysses, in the Fourteenth Book, in the course of his fabulous\r\nnarrative to Eumæus, relates that, when he was on his way from Crete\r\nto Libya, the ship in which he was sailing foundered, but that, by the\r\nfavour of Jupiter, he floated on the mast for nine days, and, on the\r\ntenth, reached the land of the Thesprotians.\r\n\r\n_Thesproti in Homer._\r\n\r\nThis statement suffices to fix that people to the north of the gulf\r\nof Ambracia (Arta). For had they lain to the south of that gulf, this\r\nwould not have been the first land for him to make, as it would have\r\nbeen covered by the islands.\r\n\r\nThe narrative which follows is very curious. The Thesprotian king\r\nPheidon, according to the tale of Ulysses, took good care of him\r\nwithout making him a slave (ἐκομίσσατο ἀπριάτην); which, as he was cast\r\nhelpless on the shore, common usage would apparently have justified,\r\nand even suggested. The king’s son, who found him in his destitute\r\ncondition, had his share in this great kindness; for he took him home,\r\nlike Nausicaa, and clothed him. Here, says the tale, he heard news\r\nof Ulysses, who had proceeded from thence to Dodona to inquire about\r\nhis fate, and had left much valuable property in trust with these\r\nhospitable and worthy people. But he goes on to relate, still in the\r\nassumed character, that, instead of keeping him to wait for Ulysses,\r\nthe Thesprotian king took advantage of the opportunity afforded by a\r\nThesprotian ship about to sail to Dulichium for corn, and dispatched\r\nhim by it as a passenger to his home. The crew, however, infected with\r\nthe kidnapping propensities of navigators, maltreated and bound him,\r\nwith the intention of selling him for a slave: but, when they landed on\r\nthe Ithacan beach to make a meal, he took advantage of the opportunity,\r\nand made his escape[466].\r\n\r\nThis ingenious fable is referred to, and in part repeated in subsequent\r\npassages of the poem[467], with no material addition, except that the\r\ncountry is called (πίων δῆμος xix. 271) a rich one.\r\n\r\nBut another passage[468], quite independent of all the former, adds\r\na highly characteristic incident. Antinous, the insolent leader of\r\nthe Suitors, is sharply rebuked by Penelope, and is reminded that\r\nhis father Eupeithes had come to the palace as a fugitive from the\r\nIthacan people, dependent on Ulysses for deliverance from their wrath.\r\nThe reason of their exasperation was, that Eupeithes had joined\r\nthe buccaneering Taphians in a piratical expedition against the\r\nThesprotians, who were allies of Ithaca.\r\n\r\nWe have here a very remarkable assemblage of characteristics, which all\r\ntend to prove, and I think very sufficiently prove, the Pelasgianism\r\nof the Thesprotians. The humane and genial reception of the stranded\r\nsea-farer is in exact accordance with the behaviour of the Egyptian\r\nking[469], and his people to him on a previous occasion. The fact that\r\nhe was not enslaved, suggests it as most probable, that there were no\r\nslaves in the Thesprotian country: which would entirely accord with\r\nthe position of the Pelasgians, as themselves not the conquerors of a\r\nrace that had preceded them, but the first inhabitants of the spots\r\nthey occupied in the Greek peninsula. The richness of their country\r\nis further in harmony with the account of Egypt, and with their\r\naddiction to agricultural pursuits. The feigned deposit by Ulysses of\r\nhis metallic stores with them proves, that they were not a predatory,\r\nand therefore proves, for that period, that they were not a poor\r\npeople. The name Pheidon, or thrifty, given to the king, agrees with\r\nthe character which, as we shall elsewhere find, attaches in a marked\r\nmanner to Pelasgian proper names. And lastly, they were the subject of\r\nattack by Taphian buccaneers; which tends to show their unoffending and\r\nunaggressive character.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, we find them trading by sea to Dulichium: and we\r\nfind the crew of the trader attempting to kidnap Ulysses. But as the\r\nPelasgians were not in general navigators, it may very well have\r\nhappened that the trade of the country had fallen into the hands of\r\nsome distinct, possibly some Lelegian, or even some Hellenic race,\r\nwhich may have settled there for the purpose of carrying on a congenial\r\nemployment, and which, like other traders of the time, would be ready\r\nupon occasion to do a turn in the way of piracy. It is to be remembered\r\nthat there was a Thesprotian[470] Ephyre; which proves, as I believe,\r\nan early infusion of some race connected with the Hellenic stem.\r\n\r\nI conclude, therefore, from Homer, that the Thesprotians were\r\nPelasgian. And this conclusion is strongly sustained by the\r\nextra-Homeric tradition. Herodotus states, that they were the parent\r\nstock from whence descended the Thessalians[471], a report which I only\r\nfollow to the extent of its signifying an affinity between the early\r\nsettlers on the two sides of Mount Pindus. And Dionysius[472] appears\r\nto imply the opinion, that they were Thesprotian Pelasgians who settled\r\nin Italy.\r\n\r\nI have already stated, that I can hardly think Homer points out to\r\nus more than one Dodona in the Iliad and Odyssey respectively. At\r\nthe same time, if the supposition of two Dodonas be admissible, the\r\ncircumstances suggested by him would help to account for it. For the\r\nDodona of the Iliad is described as Pelasgic and also Hellic: that\r\nis, as we must I think suppose, having been Pelasgic, it had become\r\nHellic. The Dodona of the Odyssey (on this supposition) is Thesprotian,\r\nthat is to say Pelasgic, only. The solution would then be, that the\r\nPelasgians of the original Dodona, when displaced, claimed to have\r\ncarried their oracle along with them, while the Hellic intruders in\r\nlike manner set up a counter-claim to have retained it in its original\r\nseat. The history of Christendom supplies us with cases bearing no\r\nremote analogy to this, in connection with the removal of a great seat\r\nof ecclesiastical power.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cadmeans._\r\n\r\n_Cadmeans in Homer._\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the name of Ino Leucothee is sufficiently identified\r\nwith a circle of Phœnician and outer-world traditions. And, as her\r\nname and position give us directly, or by suggestion, the principal\r\ntestimony borne by Homer to Cadmus her father, this will be the most\r\nconvenient place for considering his connection with Greece.\r\n\r\nWe are justified, I think, in at once assuming, first, from his\r\nrelation to Ino, that he was Phœnician; secondly, from the deification\r\nof his daughter, that he was a ruler or prince. And thirdly, Ino\r\nappears to Ulysses in his distress as a protecting deity. Now as, when\r\nmortal, she had been Phœnician by extraction, and as she thus shows her\r\nsympathies with the Hellenic race, we must assume a link between these\r\ntwo facts. They would be associated in an appropriate manner, if the\r\nfamily of Cadmus her father had become naturalized in the possession of\r\na Greek sovereignty.\r\n\r\nDiodorus Siculus has handed down a tradition respecting Cadmus[473],\r\nwhich is important from its combination with circumstantial evidence;\r\nand which is in harmony with Homer, as it appears to represent the\r\nPhœnician immigrant at a well known and natural resting-place on his\r\nway towards Greece. It is to the effect, that Cadmus put into Rhodes,\r\nbuilt there a temple of Neptune (and here we should remember the\r\nworship, and, as some think, the temple of Neptune[474] in Scheria),\r\nestablished a line of hereditary priests, and deposited offerings to\r\nMinerva of Lindos. Among these, there remained in after-times a finely\r\nwrought kettle or caldron, executed in an antique style of art, and\r\nbearing an inscription in the Phœnician character.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the name of Cadmus, we have the Homeric designations\r\nof Καδμεῖοι and Καδμείωνες. They appear to be synonymous: but the\r\npatronymical form of the latter corroborates the opinion that there\r\nwas an individual Cadmus from whom the names proceeded, that they were\r\nproperly dynastic, and not names taken from a nation or extended race.\r\n\r\nWe have next to inquire as to the period within which this race of\r\nCadmeans held sway in Bœotia, the district where alone we hear of them.\r\nWhen did they begin, and when did they close?\r\n\r\nThe extra-Homeric tradition would throw Cadmus back to one of the very\r\nearliest periods, which would appear to be included within Homer’s\r\nknowledge upwards. The generations are arranged as follows:\r\n\r\n  1. Cadmus.\r\n  2. Polydorus.\r\n  3. Labdacus.\r\n  4. Laius.\r\n  5. Œdipus.\r\n  6. Eteocles and Polynices.\r\n\r\nThe last-named brothers are contemporaries of Tydeus. It follows that\r\nCadmus is placed seven generations before the Trojan war; he is made\r\ncontemporary with Dardanus, and he appears in Greece about three and a\r\nhalf generations before Minos came to Crete.\r\n\r\nNow this is not the presumption, to which the Homeric text would\r\ngive rise. For it does not seem likely that, if a family of an\r\nactive race like the Phœnicians made their way into Greece, and\r\nmanaged to establish a sovereignty within it seven generations before\r\nthe _Troica_, upwards of a century should elapse before any other\r\nadventurer was found to repeat so advantageous a process.\r\n\r\nFurther, the Cadmeans were in Thebes. But Cadmus was not its founder.\r\nIt was founded, as we are told in the Eleventh Odyssey[475], by Zethus\r\nand Amphion, sons of Jupiter and of Antiope, daughter of Asopus: two\r\npersons who have thus, on both sides of their parentage, the signs\r\nof being the first known of their own race in the country. From the\r\nappearance of Antiope in the Νεκυΐα, where none but Hellenic and\r\nnaturalized Shades are admitted, we may infer that Amphion and Zethus\r\nwere not Pelasgian but Hellene. Again, as they _first_ founded and\r\nfortified Thebes, they must have preceded Cadmus there. What then was\r\ntheir probable date?\r\n\r\nIn the Νεκυΐα, so far as regards the women, Homer gives some appearance\r\nof meaning to introduce the persons and groups in chronological order.\r\n\r\nThe first of them all is Tyro[476], who seems to have been of the\r\nfamily of Æolus, and to have lived about four generations before the\r\n_Troica_.\r\n\r\nThe next is Antiope, mother of Amphion and Zethus.\r\n\r\nAfter her come (1) Alcmene, mother of Hercules,\r\n\r\n(2) Epicaste, mother of Œdipus, and\r\n\r\n(3) Chloris, mother of Nestor.\r\n\r\nAll of whom belong to a period three generations before the war.\r\n\r\nAfter these follow Leda and Ariadne, with others whose epoch the text\r\nof Homer does not enable us to fix. But Ariadne, the bride of Theseus,\r\nand aunt of Idomeneus (the μεσαιπόλιος), stands at about one generation\r\nand a half before the war: and Leda, as the mother of Castor and Pollux\r\nwho were dead, and of Helen whose marriageable age dated from so many\r\nyears before the action of the Iliad, as well as of Clytemnestra,\r\nbelongs to about the same date.\r\n\r\nOn the whole therefore it would appear, from the signs of chronological\r\norder, that Antiope can hardly have been older than Tyro, and therefore\r\ncan only have been about four, and her sons about three generations\r\nbefore the War. We have no vestiges of their race in Homeric history,\r\nexcept that, in the Nineteenth Odyssey[477], there is recorded the\r\ndeath of Itylus, the son of Zethus, in his boyhood. The Amphion Iasides\r\nof Od. xi. 283, must be another person. But, if this reasoning be\r\nsound, Cadmus, who succeeds to them in Thebes, was probably much more\r\nrecent than the later tradition makes him, and may have come into\r\nGreece only a short time before Minos.\r\n\r\nHis name appears to have been given as a dynastic name to his subjects,\r\nor the ruling class of them, and to have continued such under his\r\ndescendants. For not only does it appear to have begun with him, but\r\nwith the fall of the family it at once disappears.\r\n\r\nIn five different places of the poems, Homer has occasion to refer to\r\noccurrences, which took place at Thebes under the Cadmean dynasty,\r\nin the time of Œdipus and of his sons: and in these five passages he\r\nemploys the names Καδμεῖοι and Καδμείωνες no less than eight times for\r\nthe people, while he never calls them by any other name[478].\r\n\r\nBut when we come down to the time of the war, this dynasty has\r\ndisappeared with Eteocles and Polynices: the country of Bœotia, which\r\nit had once governed, seems to have lost its cohesion, and its troops\r\nare led by a body of no less than five chiefs. And now, whenever Homer\r\nhas occasion to refer to the inhabitants of the country, they are never\r\nΚαδμεῖοι or Καδμείωνες, but they are Βοιωτοί. The words Βοιωτὸς and\r\nΒοιώτιος are found nine times in the Iliad.\r\n\r\nNations called by a name which is derived from a national source, are\r\nlikely to retain it longer than those which are designated dynastically\r\nfrom the head of a ruling family: as they must change their dynasties\r\nmore frequently than they can receive new infusions of race and blood,\r\npowerful enough to acquire a predominance over the old.\r\n\r\nStrabo indeed says[479], that Homer calls the Cadmeans of the Troic\r\nwar by the name of Minyæ. But no Minyæ are named in Homer at all,\r\nalthough he speaks of the Ὀρχόμενος Μινυήïος, and of the ποταμὸς\r\nΜινυήïος in Peloponnesus, and though there was perhaps there also a\r\nMinyan Orchomenos. Even if Minyæ were named in Homer as a race, it\r\nwould be strange that Homer should without a reason alter, for the\r\nperiod of the war, that use of the Cadmean name, to which he adheres\r\nelsewhere so strictly, as to show that he is acting on a rule. Whereas\r\nthe transition to Βοιωτοὶ is not only intelligible, but politically\r\ndescriptive.\r\n\r\nUpon the foregoing facts we may found several observations:\r\n\r\n1. The Cadmean name would seem to be strictly dynastic: as it makes its\r\nfirst appearance on the spot where Cadmus has reigned, and disappears\r\nat the same point, along with the extinction of his family.\r\n\r\n2. The use of the Cadmean name by Homer, compared with his departure\r\nfrom it, each having appropriate reference to the circumstances of\r\ndifferent epochs, appears to be a marked example of a careful and\r\nhistoric manner of handling local names with reference to the exact\r\ncircumstances of place, time, and persons, and not in the loose manner\r\nof later poetry.\r\n\r\n3. Our whole view of Cadmus and the Cadmeans from Homer has been\r\nattained by circuitous inference: and, presuming it to be a just\r\none, we have here a very singular example of the poet’s reticence\r\nwith respect to all infusion of foreign blood and influence into his\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[415] Od. xi. 260.\r\n\r\n[416] Od. xi. 568.\r\n\r\n[417] Od. iv. 564.\r\n\r\n[418] Il. ii. 824; and xii. 19.\r\n\r\n[419] Od. iii. 320-2; and xiv. 257.\r\n\r\n[420] Od. xiv. 231, 243-8.\r\n\r\n[421] Od. xiv. 237; Il. xiv. 321.\r\n\r\n[422] Od. i. 105; ii. 180.\r\n\r\n[423] Od. i. 183.\r\n\r\n[424] Od. xv. 425.\r\n\r\n[425] Od. xv. 415.\r\n\r\n[426] See Wood on Homer, p. 48.\r\n\r\n[427] Od. xvii. 383.\r\n\r\n[428] Nägelsbach, Homerische Theologie 80-3.\r\n\r\n[429] There were columns outside the doors, for example, of the palace\r\nof Ulysses in Ithaca.

V.\r\n\r\n_On the Catalogue._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Catalogue in the Second Book belongs more properly to the\r\nGeography, than to the Ethnology of the poems. But I advert to it here\r\non account both of the historic matter it contains, and of the manner\r\nin which it illustrates the general historic designs of the Poet.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps, in its own way, nearly as characteristic and remarkable\r\na performance, as any among the loftier parts of the poem. Considered\r\nas a portion of the Iliad, it would be more justly termed the Array\r\nthan the Catalogue; for it is a review, and not a mere enumeration.\r\nConsidered with respect to history, its value can scarcely be\r\noverrated: it contains the highest title-deeds of whatever ancient\r\nhonour the several States might claim, and is in truth the Doomsday\r\nBook of Greece.\r\n\r\nWe may consider the Greek Catalogue in three parts:\r\n\r\n  First, the Invocation or Preface.\r\n\r\n  Secondly, the Catalogue Proper.\r\n\r\n  Thirdly, the Postscript, so to call it, 761-779.\r\n\r\nBefore and after, he has graced the work with splendid similes. When\r\nall is concluded and, as it were, marked off, he proceeds to append to\r\nit the Trojan Catalogue; a work of less extent and difficulty, as also\r\nof less penetrating interest to his hearers, but yet constructed with\r\nmuch of care, and with various descriptive embellishments.\r\n\r\nThe Preface contains the most formal invocation of the Muses among the\r\nfew which are to be found in the poems. The others are,\r\n\r\n  Il. i. 1. Introduction to the Iliad: addressed to Θεά.\r\n\r\n  Il. ii. 761. In the Postscript to the Catalogue.\r\n\r\n  Il. xi. 218. Before the recital of the persons who were slain by\r\n  Agamemnon.\r\n\r\n  Il. xiv. 508. Before the recital of the Greek chiefs, who, on the\r\n  turn of the battle, slew various Trojans.\r\n\r\n  Il. xvi. 112. Before proceeding to relate, how the Trojans hurled the\r\n  firebrands at the Grecian ships.\r\n\r\n  Od. i. 1. Introduction to the Odyssey: addressed to Μοῦσα.\r\n\r\nIn the cases of the Eleventh and Fourteenth Books, the invocation of\r\nthe Muse stands in connection with a particular effort of memory; for\r\nthe recitals prefaced by it consist of names not connected by any\r\nnatural tie one with the other. But it is here that the Poet’s appeal\r\nto the Muse most deserves attention.\r\n\r\nIf Homer was composing a written poem, the invocation is ill-timed and\r\nunmeaning. He has already, by a series of fine similes, elevated the\r\nsubject to a proper level. Considered as a mere written Catalogue, it\r\ndoes not deserve or account for the prayer for aid: in this point of\r\nview, it was of necessity among the _sermoni propiora_, and was one of\r\nthe easiest parts of the poem to compose. But if we consider the poem\r\nas a recitation, then the Catalogue was very difficult; because of the\r\ngreat multitude of details which are included in it, and which are not\r\nin themselves connected together by any natural or obvious link.\r\n\r\nIt is true that he begs the Muses to inform him, because they were\r\nomnipresent and omniscient, whereas he is dependent on report only\r\n(κλέος) for information. Now this was equally true of the whole\r\nmaterial of the poem: but the reason why he introduces the statement of\r\nthis truth in so marked a manner, must be from the arduous nature of\r\nthe task he was beginning; nor could it be arduous in any other way,\r\nthan as an effort of memory.\r\n\r\nThe invocation contains another proof that the poems were composed for\r\nrecitation in the words (vv. 489, 90)\r\n\r\n    οὐδ’ εἴ μοι δέκα μὲν γλῶσσαι, δέκα δὲ στόματ’ εἶεν\r\n    φωνὴ δ’ ἄρρηκτος, χαλκέον δέ μοι ἦτορ ἐνείη.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more proper than to refer to the insufficient ability\r\nof the bodily organs of recitation, if he were about to recite: but\r\nnothing less proper, if he were engaged on a written poem. It has been\r\na fashion however with poets to copy Homer in this passage, although\r\nthe reason and circumstances on which it is founded had become wholly\r\ninapplicable: and their abusive imitation has blinded us to the\r\nsignificance of the passage as it stands in the Iliad.\r\n\r\nNow as regards the list itself.\r\n\r\n_The Greek Array._\r\n\r\nIn this Catalogue, he had to go through the different States of Greece,\r\nfurnishing twenty-nine contingents of various strengths, all indicated\r\nby the number of ships, to the army. These contingents are under\r\nforty-five leaders, many of them with genealogies, and coming from one\r\nhundred and seventy-one Greek towns. The proper names of the Greek\r\nCatalogue, strictly so called, are three hundred and ninety-six, and\r\nthose of the Trojan one hundred and five, making in all five hundred\r\nand one. These must have been a selection from a larger number, for\r\nthere were Greek towns (for example Φηραὶ of the Peloponnesus, Od. iii.\r\n488, and the various towns named Ἐφύρη) not named in the Catalogue;\r\nand this again increased the difficulty of keeping by memory to the\r\nlist throughout. Again, it was difficult to adopt any arrangement\r\nthat should not be wholly arbitrary, in displaying to us the parts of\r\nan army which comprised so many divisions, and which was drawn from\r\nsources so numerous, and dispersed over a territory of such extremely\r\nirregular formation.\r\n\r\n_The principle of arrangement._\r\n\r\nHomer has however with great ingenuity adopted a geographical\r\narrangement in the Greek Catalogue, which, so far as the various\r\ndivisions were concerned, has enabled him to combine them into a kind\r\nof whole.\r\n\r\nThe territory, which supplied the army, consisted partly of continent,\r\nand partly of islands: and the islands again were partly such as, lying\r\nabout the coast of the mainland, might be most conveniently remembered\r\nin conjunction with it, partly such as formed a group of themselves.\r\n\r\nIf we take the continent and islands together, we shall find that they\r\nform part of a curvilinear figure, not indeed circular, but elliptical,\r\nand more nearly approaching a circle than that group of islands in\r\nthe Ægean, which afterwards obtained the name of Cyclades. This name,\r\ntaken from the rude approximation to a geometrical figure, may possibly\r\nhave been at first suggested to the Greeks by Homer’s geometrical\r\narrangement in the Catalogue. I speak of Homer’s arrangement as\r\ngeometrical, because the principle he has adopted is that of mental\r\nfigure drawing: it is of course of the rudest kind, and he perhaps did\r\nnot even know the correct mode of constructing a circle.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of the figure formed by the mainland and islands is\r\nabout two-thirds of a complete circumference: the ends of the curve\r\nbeing Thessaly to the north, and Calydnæ, with the other small\r\nislands, in the south-east.\r\n\r\nLet us now proceed to notice, firstly, the primary division of the\r\nCatalogue into principal parts, and secondly, the subdivision in each\r\nof those parts.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while to remark, that the Poet has not adopted the mode\r\nof enumeration which might have been thought most obvious: namely, to\r\nbegin at one of the extremities of this semicircle (so to call it), and\r\nthen proceed towards the other. If the territorial subdivisions had\r\nbeen regular, this would have been convenient: but from their utter\r\nirregularity it would in this case have been wholly useless.\r\n\r\nAgain, he might have begun with Agamemnon, his immediate forces and\r\ndominion; and might then proceed through the States according to the\r\npolitical importance of their respective contingents. But to this\r\ncourse there were two objections. First, their order could not on this\r\nprinciple have been easily decided, especially after passing a few\r\nof the most considerable. But, secondly, he appears to have avoided,\r\nwith a fixed purpose and with an extraordinary skill, both here and\r\nelsewhere, whatever could have excited feelings of jealousy as between\r\nthe several States of Greece. Of course I do not refer to the admitted\r\nsupremacy of Agamemnon: but if he had attempted to place the forces\r\nof Nestor, Diomed, Menelaus, of the Athenians, the Arcadians, the\r\nPhthians, in an order thus regulated, it would have been at variance\r\nwith obvious prudence, and with his uniform rule of action. Perhaps,\r\nhowever, we may rightly consider, that if Homer had been writing his\r\npoems, he could not have failed to give Agamemnon the first place\r\nin this description. He has not then followed the general form of\r\nthe territory, nor has he begun with the chief political member of\r\nthe armament. Nor, lastly, has he even treated the Peloponnesus as a\r\nseparate division of Greece: but he has introduced it, though it was\r\nthe most important part of the country, between the eastern parts\r\n(Bœotia, with six other States) and the western parts (Ætolia, with two\r\nother States) of Middle Greece.\r\n\r\nThere are therefore various modes of arrangement, which either\r\npolitically or geographically might be termed obvious, but which the\r\nPoet has passed by. Why has he passed them by? and why has he begun the\r\nCatalogue with the Bœotians? who were neither powerful, nor ancient,\r\nnor distinguished in a remarkable degree; nor did they lie at any one\r\nof the geographical extremities of the country.\r\n\r\nAgain, it might be asked, why has he not either divided all the\r\nislands from Continental Greece, or none? Instead of that, he reckons\r\nEubœa, Cephallenia, Zacynthus, and Ithaca, in the same division with\r\nContinental Greece, but begins a new division with Crete.\r\n\r\nLet us now carefully note what he has done, and see whether it does not\r\nsuggest the reasons.\r\n\r\nThe three principal divisions of the Catalogue would appear to lie as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nI. Continental Greece south of mount Œta, including the Middle and the\r\nSouthern division, with the islands immediately adjacent. This section\r\nfurnishes sixteen contingents. (Il. ii. 494-644.)\r\n\r\nII. Insular Greece, from Crete to Calydnæ: these islands furnish four\r\ncontingents. (645-680.)\r\n\r\nIII. Thessalian Greece, from Œta and Othrys in the south, to Olympus in\r\nthe north: which furnishes nine contingents. (681-759.)\r\n\r\nThese three divisions completely sever the line of the semicircular\r\ncurve. It follows that in recitation he would be able to dispose of\r\neach part severally, as each forms a compact figure of itself: and this\r\nhe could not have done, had he followed the seemingly more natural\r\ndivision into continent and islands. At the interval between the first\r\nand the second, he makes a spring from Ætolia to Crete: and another\r\nbetween the second and the third, from the Calydnæ to Thessaly.\r\n\r\nThe _desideratum_ obviously was, to assist memory by such a\r\ngeographical disposition, that the different parts might be made by\r\nassociation each to suggest that which was immediately to follow. So\r\ndistributed, they would supply a kind of _memoria technica_.\r\n\r\nWe see how he prepares for this operation by his distribution in chief,\r\nwhich gives him the three sections of Greece, as they succeed one\r\nanother on the line of the (completed) figure.\r\n\r\nAnd, though we may not yet have in view a reason for his beginning\r\nwith the Bœotians, we seem now at least to have a reason before us for\r\nhis beginning with the middle section instead of one of the extremes;\r\nnamely, that it was the principal one, as it not only supplied the\r\nlargest number of ships and men, and nearly all the greater commanders,\r\nbut also as it contains the seat of sovereignty, and supplied the\r\nforces of the Chief of the army.\r\n\r\nHaving the three sections before us, let us now observe the manner in\r\nwhich he manages the sub-distribution, so as to make each district of\r\nterritory lead him on to the next.\r\n\r\nAnd here he seems evidently to proceed upon these two rules: first,\r\nnever to pass over an intervening territory, though he may cross a\r\nstrait or gulf.\r\n\r\nAnd secondly, to throw the several States into rude circles or other\r\nfigures, round the arc or along the line of which his recollection\r\nmoves from point to point.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n\r\nMAP I.\r\n\r\n_FOR THE CATALOGUE._\r\n\r\nThe Sections are the main divisions.\r\n\r\n_The Figures are the Sub-divisions._\r\n\r\n_The islands I, II, III, IV, make up the\r\nSecond Section and the Third Figure._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n\r\nMAP II.\r\n\r\n_THE CATALOGUE._\r\n\r\nFIGURE I.\r\n\r\n   I.

Crete.\r\n\r\n2. Rhodes.\r\n\r\n3. Syme.\r\n\r\n4. Cos and other islands. Carpathus is included, which lay between\r\nCrete and Rhodes; being apparently in political union with Cos and\r\nthe Calydnæ, and contributing to the same contingent, it could not\r\nbut stand with them. Strabo observes that this principle of political\r\ndivision, according to what he terms δυνάστειαι[483], has been adopted\r\nby the Poet in his account of the Thessalian contingents.\r\n\r\nBy reference to the rude maps annexed, which mark the several\r\ncontingents by figures, the nature of this contrivance will be clearly\r\nseen.\r\n\r\n_The order for Thessaly._\r\n\r\nIt is more difficult to trace Homer’s method of proceeding with respect\r\nto Thessaly.\r\n\r\nThis country furnishes nine contingents, which may best be described\r\nby the names of their leaders. There is no difficulty as to the first\r\nfour, except that some of the boundaries are indeterminate. They form,\r\nlike the last or insular group, an incomplete circle[484]. The leaders\r\nare;\r\n\r\nI. Achilles (681-94).\r\n\r\nII. Protesilaus (695-710).\r\n\r\nIII. Eumelus (711-15).\r\n\r\nIV. Philoctetes (716-28).\r\n\r\nThere is more difficulty in describing the arrangement of the\r\nremainder. Strabo, who has followed the Catalogue in Thessaly with\r\ngreat minuteness, seems to have noticed the circular arrangement:\r\nat least he speaks of the κύκλος τῆς Θετταλίας, and the περιόδεια\r\nτῆς χώρας[485]. But when he comes to the sixth division, that of\r\nEurypylus, he appears to find it impossible to fix with any confidence\r\nthe site of Ormenium: and says, καὶ ἄλλα δ’ ἐστὶν ἃ λέγοι τις ἂν,\r\nἀλλ’ οὖν ὀκνῶ διατρίβειν ἐπὶ πλέον[486]. And further on he observes,\r\nthat the displacements and changes of cities, and mixtures of races,\r\nhave confounded the names and tribes[487], so as to make them in part\r\nunintelligible to men of his day: where we are anew reminded of the\r\npassage of Thucydides, in which he tells us, that the most fertile\r\ntracts underwent the most frequent changes of population[488].\r\n\r\nThe δυναστεία of Eurypylus is in our maps commonly placed on the sea\r\ncoast, but as it appears, with little authority of any kind: while,\r\nafter all the proof we have seen of continuous arrangement, it seems\r\nincredible that, in this instance alone, Homer could have followed an\r\norder such that the δυναστεία should not march either with that which\r\nprecedes, or that which follows, but should be severed from them by a\r\nline of territories intervening, which he has already disposed of.\r\n\r\nTo judge from analogy with the otherwise uniform rule of the Catalogue,\r\nthe dominions of Eurypylus must have been somewhere conterminous both\r\nwith those of the Asclepiads, and with those of Polypœtes. Waiving\r\nhowever any effort to fix positively their site, we find the other four\r\nremaining contingents connected by a zigzag line[489], like that which\r\nwas used in southern Greece. The leaders are as follows:\r\n\r\nI. Podaleirius and Machaon (729-33). (Eurypylus 734-7, omitted.)\r\n\r\nII. Polypœtes (738-47).\r\n\r\nIII. Gouneus (Enienes, Perrhæbi, and Dodona, 748-55).\r\n\r\nIV. Prothous (the Magnesians, 756-9).\r\n\r\nIn this view Homer appears to subdivide Thessaly into two figures,\r\nas he had done Southern Greece: and in both cases one of them is\r\ncurvilinear, in which the eastern parts are arranged: the other a\r\nzigzag, which includes the western portions.\r\n\r\nI have described this geometrical arrangement, as of great interest\r\nin connection with the question, whether the poems were written or\r\nrecited; and also as it seems to be in itself highly ingenious.\r\n\r\nIt seems to distribute in rude but real symmetry before the eye of the\r\nmind, an assemblage of objects between which it would at first sight\r\nappear almost impossible to frame any link of connection.\r\n\r\nBut in Homer, though there is much that is ingenious, there is nothing\r\nthat is far-fetched: and the order he has followed might well, as to\r\nmany parts at least of Greece, have been that of his own itinerancy as\r\na minstrel. And, though complex in other respects, yet if it reduces\r\na complex physical arrangement to the form, in which it becomes\r\npractically more manageable than in any other way for his purposes, it\r\nis evidently the one which may best be justified on the principles of\r\ncommon sense.\r\n\r\n_Fresh proofs of historical intention._\r\n\r\nThe Greek Catalogue is also full of proofs of the historical intention\r\nof Homer.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, such proof is afforded by the immense amount of its\r\ndetails, which are _prima facie_ a load upon his verse, and which Homer\r\nseems to have so regarded, from the care he has taken to relieve the\r\nsubject by the cluster of similes at the beginning. He must have had a\r\npurpose in facing this disadvantage. It is quite at variance with his\r\nown spirit, and the spirit of his age, to suppose that this purpose was\r\nmerely to flatter the vanity of hearers by wholesale fiction.\r\n\r\nThe use of supernatural machinery is agreeable to the genius of\r\nthe poet and his age, but not so the vulgar falsification of plain\r\nterrestrial facts. If the supposition of wholesale fiction cannot be\r\nmaintained, there is no other alternative but that of an historical\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nViewed at large, the Catalogue is an answer to that normal question,\r\nwhich expresses the anxiety of every Greek to make the acquaintance\r\nof a man first of all through what are colloquially termed his\r\n‘belongings.’\r\n\r\n    Τίς; πόθεν εἶς ἀνδρῶν; πόθι τοι πόλις; ἠδὲ τοκῆες[490];\r\n\r\nThe chief indication of departure from this purpose is in the case of\r\nNireus[491]. This paltry leader is almost the only person of legitimate\r\nbirth, both of whose parents are named: and while he is evidently\r\nintroduced for his beauty only, it is most suspicious that his father\r\nshould be named Χάροψ, and likewise his mother Ἀγλαΐη. This savours of\r\nthe names Δημόδοκος and Τερπιάδης, which Homer has given to his Bards\r\nin the Odyssey. And again of his Phronius, son of Noemon, whom he\r\nintroduces to play the part of a considerate and serviceable Ithacan\r\ncitizen[492]. With the insignificant island of Syme Homer might, for\r\na special object, well take this liberty. And we may observe here, as\r\nelsewhere, that what is probably a departure from literal truth, may\r\nalso be in a higher view historical: for doubtless his object is to\r\ncommemorate impressively the wonderful beauty of Nireus, and this he\r\ndoes by inventing appropriate accessories.\r\n\r\nAgain, though an accurate geography would not of itself have proved\r\nthe personal parts of the narrative to be historical, it is scarcely\r\nconceivable that he would have adopted one so minute and elaborate, as\r\nwell as exact, if he had meant to combine with it a string of merely\r\nfictitious personalities.\r\n\r\n_Genealogies of the Catalogue._\r\n\r\nThirdly, besides many simple patronymics, there are found thirteen\r\nminor genealogies in the Catalogue, ten of them Greek, and three\r\nforeign. They are of three generations only in every case, with the\r\nsingle exception of the Orchomenian leaders, who have four: and in\r\nevery case they attach to secondary heroes, who are thus treated in a\r\nmass, while provision is made in other parts of the poem for making\r\nknown to us the descent (with the exception of Ajax) of all the greater\r\nheroes, as occasion serves to state it for each of them singly. Now\r\nit is inconceivable, even on general grounds, that the poet should\r\nhave invented this mass of names; for they could surely have excited\r\nno sort of interest among his hearers, except upon one ground. They\r\nmust have been true genealogical records of persons, who had played a\r\npart in the great national drama; one not perhaps of high importance,\r\nyet sufficient to be the basis of such traditions, as are justly\r\ndeemed worthy of local record among a people eminently strong in their\r\nmunicipal, as well as their general patriotism. Over and above this,\r\nmany points of these minor genealogies coincide with, and illustrate\r\nother historical notices in other parts of the poem.\r\n\r\nAgain, there are in all eight cases in the Catalogue, where the name of\r\na mother is mentioned. These are,\r\n\r\n1. Astyoche, mother of Ascalaphus and Ialmenus, Mars being the father,\r\nv. 513.\r\n\r\n2. Aroura mother of Erechtheus, no father being mentioned, v. 548.\r\n\r\n3. Astyochea mother of Tlepolemus, Hercules being the father, v. 658.\r\n\r\n4. Aglaie mother of Nireus, Charops the father, v. 672.\r\n\r\n5. Alcestis mother of Eumelus, Admetus the father, v. 715.\r\n\r\n6. Rhene mother of Medon, Oileus the father, v. 728.\r\n\r\n7. Hippodamia mother of Polypœtes, Pirithous the father, v. 742.\r\n\r\n8. Venus is mentioned as the mother of Æneas, Anchises being the\r\nfather, v. 820.\r\n\r\nThe second of these cases, if we are to regard the passage containing\r\nit as Homeric, must not be considered as an account of parentage, but\r\nsimply as a mode of asserting autochthonism. Again, the parents of\r\nNireus, whether true persons or not, are evidently named with reference\r\nto the consideration of beauty only, which is the key to the whole\r\npassage.\r\n\r\nAnd the parentage of Æneas may also perhaps be named for the sole\r\npurpose of embellishment.\r\n\r\nDescribed by the words θεὰ βροτῷ εὐνηθεῖσα, it does not appear to stand\r\nin the same class, or to be susceptible of the same explanations, as\r\nthose Greek cases where Greek chieftains born out of wedlock have\r\ngods for their fathers; nor is there any case, among the Greeks, of\r\nillegitimate birth from a goddess. Of the five other cases three (1,\r\n3, and 6), are obviously illegitimate births, one at least of them\r\nwith a fabulous father. This raises the presumption that the name of\r\nthe mother was mentioned as the only remaining means of recording the\r\ndescent: inasmuch as the persons would otherwise have been οὐτίδανοι.\r\nIt may reasonably be conjectured, that all these births were out of\r\nwedlock.\r\n\r\nThe epithets of the Catalogue are so accurately descriptive of the\r\ncountry, that they have always been used as tests of the traditions\r\nrespecting the situations of the places to which they refer. They are\r\nnot less exactly in harmony with the descriptions in other parts of\r\nthe poem, and this in minor cases, where purposed fiction can hardly\r\nbe supposed, not less than in the greater ones. For instance, the\r\nArcadians of Il. vii. 134, are ἐγχεσίμωροι: those of the Catalogue\r\nare ἀγχιμάχηται (604), and ἐπιστάμενοι πολεμίζειν (611). The Pelasgi\r\nof Il. x. 429 are δῖοι, those of the Catalogue (840) are ἐγχεσίμωροι.\r\nThe Cephallenians of the Catalogue are μεγάθυμοι (631), those of Il.\r\niv. 330 are στίχες οὐκ ἀλαπαδναί. The Crete of the Odyssey (xix.\r\n174) has ἐννήκοντα πόληες, the Crete of the Catalogue (v. 649) is\r\nἑκατόμπολις[493].\r\n\r\nSingle commands are in every instance assigned to those who in the\r\nrest of the poem appear as chiefs of the first order. In the case of\r\nIdomeneus alone is this in any way obscured; as the passage (645-51)\r\nruns: ‘Idomeneus led the Cretans.... Idomeneus led them, with\r\nMeriones.’ But it is very remarkable that Meriones holds just this sort\r\nof ambiguous relation to Idomeneus in the poem at large: sometimes he\r\nis called his θεράπων (xxiii. 113 _et alibi_), and his ὀπάων (x. 58 _et\r\nalibi_), while he stands among the nine first warriors of the army, who\r\n(vii. 161), volunteer for single combat with Hector; and when Idomeneus\r\nleads the van, he manages the rear (iv. 251-4). Again, though the\r\nopportunities afforded by the Catalogue are of necessity narrow, yet\r\nHomer has contrived within its limits to mark distinctly the character\r\nand position of nearly every great chieftain: certainly of Agamemnon,\r\nAchilles, Menelaus, Telamonian Ajax (v. 668), and Ulysses.\r\n\r\n_The Epilogue._\r\n\r\nThe third portion, or epilogue, appears to be ascribable chiefly to\r\nthe genial love of Homer for the horse. His arrangement of the army\r\naccording to the number of ships, which conveyed each division, had\r\nshut out the mention of the chariots and the coursers who drew them,\r\nand he appears to have devised this closing invocation for the purpose\r\nof supplying the defect. It was certainly not necessary in order to\r\nfix the position of Achilles in the army, which the First Book had\r\ncompletely developed; and the passage is chiefly occupied with the\r\nhorses of Eumelus, together with those of Achilles and his force.\r\n\r\nIt contains, however, two remarkable notes of historical veracity. The\r\nhorses of Eumelus, a Thessalian, are proclaimed to have been by far the\r\nbest (μέγ’ ἄρισται): and the Myrmidons, again a Thessalian contingent,\r\nare here spoken of as having a number of separate chariots and horses;\r\nwe are told (773), ‘the soldiers played at games.... The horses stood\r\nfeeding, each near his own chariot, and the chariots were in their\r\nsheds.’ This is never said of any other contingent in the army. In\r\nstrict harmony with this picture, Thessaly was conspicuous throughout\r\nthe historic times of Greece, for the excellence of its breeds of\r\nhorses, and the high character of its cavalry.\r\n\r\nIf all this be so, we cannot wonder at the high estimation in which the\r\nCatalogue of Homer was held by the Greeks of after-ages, as the great\r\nand only systematic record of the national claims of the respective\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nThis was not merely literary or private estimation: the Catalogue had\r\nthe place of an authoritative public document. Under the laws of Solon,\r\nfor example, it received the honour of public recitation on solemn\r\noccasions. It was also quoted for the decision of controversies. In the\r\ncritical moment, which preceded the first Persian war, the Athenian and\r\nSpartan envoys apply on the part of Greece to Gelon for his aid. He\r\nclaims the command. In resisting this claim and urging their own right\r\nto lead the fleet, unless that post be claimed by the Lacedæmonians,\r\nthe Athenians found their pretensions on the magnitude of their fleet,\r\ntheir autochthonism, and, finally, the testimony of Homer to the merits\r\nof Menestheus[494].\r\n\r\n_The Trojan Catalogue._\r\n\r\nThe Trojan Catalogue has less of organic connection than the Greek with\r\nthe structure of the poem at large.\r\n\r\nIn proceeding to this portion of his work, the poet does not renew his\r\nornamental similes, or his invocation to the Muse. He evidently meant\r\nto lower the tone of his strain: and moreover he was not about to tax\r\nmemory as he had done in the former operation, the proper names being\r\nonly about one fourth in number of those used for the Greeks, and none\r\nof them being arranged in long strings like the towns of Bœotia.\r\n\r\nHe now begins in what may be called a natural order: taking first that\r\nsection of the army, which was supplied by the Troic sovereignties,\r\nprincipal and subordinate; and among these giving the first place to\r\nthe troops of Ilion itself, as the most considerable, and as those\r\nchiefly concerned. The next is given to the Dardan forces, which were\r\nconnected with the original seat of the race, and the following ones to\r\nthe contingents supplied by the subordinate sovereigns of the rest of\r\nTroas.\r\n\r\nHis pursuit of this order reminds us, that the geographical\r\ndistribution was in the case of the Trojan list simple, and did not\r\nrequire the aid of mental geometry, as he had only to follow, almost\r\nthroughout, a single line of States along the European and Asiatic\r\ncoasts. It also strengthens the presumption that, when Homer chose an\r\norder so different, and so much less natural and obvious, in the case\r\nof the Greeks, he must have been governed by some peculiar reason.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that, of the eleven divisions of the Allies, the\r\ntwo first are the Pelasgians and the Thracians. As the blood of these\r\ntwo races flowed likewise in the veins of the Greeks, the precedence\r\ngiven to them may have been founded on this relationship. But this\r\npresumption is qualified by our finding that, doubtless on the ground\r\nof geographical order, the Lycian contingent, which had, at any rate,\r\nstrong Greek affinities, comes last of all.\r\n\r\nFor a reason given elsewhere, we must consider the numbers assigned\r\nto the Greek contingents as approximate representations of their\r\nrespective force: but the omission to particularize numbers at all in\r\nthe Trojan Catalogue is itself an evidence of its historical character.\r\nThe Trojan army was of a miscellaneous character: we also know that\r\nthe allied contingents went and came, and that their absence from\r\nhome, not prompted by the same powerful motives as that of the Greeks,\r\nwas shortened by reliefs. Thus we find Rhesus with his Thracians just\r\narrived in the Tenth Book[495]: Memnon comes to Troy after the death\r\nof Hector[496]: and we are told of the sons of Hippotion (Il. xiii.\r\n792), who ἦλθον ἀμοιβοί, had come as reliefs, on the preceding day. An\r\narmy thus collected piecemeal, and thus fluctuating in its composition,\r\ncould not leave behind it the same accessible traditions. Again, the\r\ndestruction of Troy itself obliterated what alone could have been their\r\ndepository; nor had Homer, as a Greek bard, either the same motives\r\nor the same means for gathering detailed information, as he would\r\nnaturally possess with reference to his own countrymen.\r\n\r\nHence, as the Trojan Catalogue is shorter, so also its scope is more\r\nlimited. It contains no specification of forces: no anecdotes going\r\nfarther back than the existing generation: scarcely any of what may\r\nbe called specialties of character or position as to the chiefs. It\r\nshows a good deal of knowledge of the geography and products of the\r\ncountries, but this knowledge is of a much more general and vague\r\ncharacter, than that which he has displayed in almost every portion\r\nof the Greek Array. He gives here very few lists of towns at all, and\r\nnever uses epithets requiring us to believe that he had a personal\r\nknowledge of their site and character. Only Ariste is δῖα, and Larissa\r\nis ἐριβώλαξ. In two or three cases he speaks of commercial products;\r\na characteristic which it is obvious that he might have learned\r\nwithout any personal experience of the countries. He does not use\r\nthis particular kind of sign at all in the descriptions of the Greek\r\nCatalogue: and we may perhaps correctly interpret it, where it appears,\r\nas a token of his want of vivid and experimental knowledge.\r\n\r\nHe also occasionally names a mountain or a river. But there is a\r\ngeneral avoidance of particular and characteristic epithets, such\r\nas, (to refer to the Bœotian list alone,) πετρήεσσα given to Aulis,\r\nπολύκνημος to Eteonos, εὐρύχορος to Mycalesos, ἐϋκτίμενον to Medeon and\r\nHypothebæ, πολυτρήρων to Thisbe, ποιήεις to Haliartos, πολυστάφυλος to\r\nArne, ἐσχατόωσα to Anthedon, with perhaps one or two other cases.\r\n\r\nAnother material inference is suggested by the very different texture\r\nof the Trojan Catalogue.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, this vagueness of description cannot, I think, but be\r\nregarded as much in conflict with the belief that Homer was a Greek of\r\nAsia Minor, if at least his comparative knowledge of the two countries\r\non the opposite sides of the Ægean is to be taken as a sign, either\r\npositive or negative, of his nativity.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[480] Fig. i. in Map.\r\n\r\n[481] Fig. ii. in Map.\r\n\r\n[482] Fig. iii. in Map.\r\n\r\n[483] ix. 5. p. 430.\r\n\r\n[484] Fig. iv. in Map.\r\n\r\n[485] Strabo ix. p. 435.\r\n\r\n[486] Ibid. p. 439.\r\n\r\n[487] Ibid. p. 442.\r\n\r\n[488] Thuc. i. 2.\r\n\r\n[489] Fig. v. in Map.\r\n\r\n[490] Od. i. 170, _et alibi_.\r\n\r\n[491] I am not prepared to contend that the numbers of the ships are to\r\nbe taken as literally correct: but this subject will be discussed in\r\nconjunction with his general mode of using number, in the ‘Studies on\r\nPoetry,’ sect. iii.\r\n\r\n[492] Od. ii. 386.\r\n\r\n[493] The reasons for treating this as a coincidence will be found in a\r\npaper on Homer’s use of number.

VI.\r\n\r\n_On the Hellenes of Homer; and with them_,\r\n\r\nHellas; Panhellenes; Cephallenes; Helli or Selli.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Hellas of Homer._\r\n\r\nWe have next to inquire into the force of the Hellenic name in the\r\npoems of Homer.\r\n\r\nIt meets us not, like the Pelasgic, in a single form, but in a group of\r\nwords; among which, the principal are as follows:\r\n\r\n  1. Ἕλληνες, Il. ii. 684.  }\r\n  2. Πανέλληνες, ibid. 530. } National or tribal names.\r\n  3. Σελλοὶ, Il. xvi. 234.  }\r\n\r\nAnd, lastly, the territorial name of\r\n\r\n  4. Ἕλλας.\r\n\r\nObserving the order of derivation as it has been pointed out by\r\nMure[497], we shall naturally look to the word Ἕλλας as a guide to\r\nthe meaning of its derivatives, Ἕλληνες and Πανέλληνες. It is itself\r\ndrawn from Ἑλλοὶ or Σελλοί: but as that name is only once used in the\r\nPoems, and as by far the largest body of evidence tells upon the word\r\nἝλλας, the decision upon the whole group of words will turn mainly upon\r\nthe inquiry we shall have to make into the use of that word by Homer.\r\nWith it therefore we shall commence. Is there, we have to ask, clear\r\nproof, that it went beyond the dominions of Peleus? If it went beyond\r\nthem, how far did it go? and did it include that division of Greece, in\r\nwhich Locris lay, whose inhabitants a particular line of the Catalogue\r\nclasses with the Panhellenes? For no suspicion of spuriousness can\r\njustly arise out of the fact (if it be one), that Homer calls by the\r\nname of Hellenes the inhabitants of any country, which was itself\r\nwithin the scope of the territorial name Hellas: inasmuch as this is\r\nlittle more than, the word Yorkshire being given, to make use also of\r\nthe word Yorkshiremen.\r\n\r\nAt the outset, however, it is essential to observe, that a certain\r\nelasticity in the use of geographical as well as political names could\r\nnot but belong to the age, in which Homer lived: first, because of the\r\nsuccessive movements of tribes, like wave on wave, so that the use of\r\nany such name would ordinarily be either growing or declining, but\r\nnot stationary: secondly, because of the indeterminate forms which\r\npolitical authority assumed, as resting on a mixture, in unknown\r\nproportions, of the various elements of custom, compact, reverence, and\r\nforce: and, thirdly, because of the want of well-defined geographical\r\nboundaries.\r\n\r\nWe are not entitled to assume that the territory, which we call Greece,\r\nwas, in Homer’s time, subdivided with precision between a given number\r\nof territorial names. We hear of Phthia, Ægialus, Elis, Arcadia:\r\nbut these seem to be the exceptions rather than the rule. For many\r\nparts of it there are no local names whatever; and we must not look\r\nfor any thing resembling the manner in which England is made up of\r\nits counties, France of its departments, or the later Greece of its\r\nindividual states.\r\n\r\nThe passages in which the word Hellas is used by Homer stand as follows\r\nin the order of the Poems:\r\n\r\n1. A verse in the Catalogue, Il. ii. 683:\r\n\r\n    οἵ τ’ εἶχον Φθίην ἠδ’ Ἑλλάδα καλλιγυναῖκα.\r\n\r\n2. (Achilles _loquitur_), ix. 395:\r\n\r\n    πολλαὶ Ἀχαΐιδές εἰσιν ἀν’ Ἑλλάδα τε Φθίην τε.\r\n\r\n3. (Phœnix _loq._), ibid. 447:\r\n\r\n    οἷον ὅτε πρῶτον λίπον Ἑλλάδα καλλιγυναῖκα.\r\n\r\n4. (Phœnix _loq._), ibid. 478:\r\n\r\n    φεῦγον ἔπειτ’ ἀπάνευθε δι’ Ἑλλάδος εὐρυχόροιο,\r\n    Φθίην δ’ ἐξικόμην ἐριβώλακα.\r\n\r\n5. (In the narrative), Il. xvi. 595:\r\n\r\n    Χάλκωνος φίλον υἱὸν, ὃς Ἑλλάδι οἴκια ναίων\r\n    ὄλβῳ τε πλούτῳ τε μετέπρεπε Μυρμιδόνεσσιν.\r\n\r\n6. (Penelope _loq._), Od. i. 344:\r\n\r\n                                      μεμνημένη αἰεὶ\r\n    ἀνδρὸς, τοῦ κλέος εὐρὺ καθ’ Ἑλλάδα καὶ μέσον Ἄργος.\r\n\r\n7. (Penelope _loq._), Od. iv. 724:\r\n\r\n    ἣ πρὶν μὲν πόσιν ἐσθλὸν ἀπώλεσα θυμολέοντα,\r\n    παντοίῃς ἀρέτῃσι κεκασμένον ἐν Δαναοῖσι,\r\n    ἐσθλὸν, τοῦ κλέος εὐρὺ καθ’ Ἑλλάδα καὶ μέσον Ἄργος.\r\n\r\n8. Penelope repeats the same lines, Od. iv. 814-16.\r\n\r\n9. (Achilles _loq._), Od. xi. 494:\r\n\r\n    εἶπε δέ μοι, Πηλῆος ἀμύμονος εἴ τι πέπυσσαι·\r\n    ἢ ἐτ’ ἔχει τιμὴν πολέσιν μετὰ Μυρμιδόνεσσιν\r\n    ἤ μιν ἀτιμάζουσιν ἀν’ Ἑλλάδα τε Φθίην τε.\r\n\r\n10. (Menelaus _loq._), to Telemachus, Od. xv. 80:\r\n\r\n    εἰ δ’ ἐθέλεις τραφθῆναι ἀν’ Ἑλλάδα καὶ μέσον Ἄργος,\r\n    ὄφρα τοι αὐτὸς ἕπωμαι, ὑποζεύξω δέ τοι ἵππους,\r\n    ἄστεα δ’ ἀνθρώπων ἡγήσομαι.\r\n\r\nOf these passages, there are some which admit for the word Hellas\r\nthe contracted sense of the dominions of Peleus, or even of a simple\r\nportion of them. Namely the following:\r\n\r\nIn (1) we are reading part of the description of the country, from\r\nwhich the force of Achilles was drawn. Beginning from the line which\r\nprecedes it, we may translate thus: ‘the inhabitants of Alos, and of\r\nAlope, and of Trachin, and those who occupied Phthia, and the Hellas\r\nof fair women.’ It is clear, on the face of the passage, that, whatever\r\nit may mean, the sense does not require it to mean more in this place\r\nthan a particular district, forming part of the dominions of Peleus.\r\n\r\nIn (2), where Achilles says, there are many Achæan maids through Hellas\r\nand Phthia, any one of whom he can have for a wife.\r\n\r\nIn (5), where we are told that Bathycles, son of Chalcon, dwelt in\r\nHellas, preeminent among the Myrmidons in prosperity and wealth.\r\n\r\nAnd in (9), where the shade of Achilles asks whether his father Peleus\r\nis still in the enjoyment of kingly power in the populous country of\r\nthe Myrmidons, or whether he is deprived and despised through the range\r\nof Hellas and Phthia.\r\n\r\nBut among these four passages there is a distinction. In (1), (5), and\r\n(9) Hellas is combined with Phthia. Now we have seen, that there were\r\nPhthians beyond the dominions of Peleus: if the territorial name Phthia\r\nwas similarly extended, then the presumption would arise that Hellas\r\nalso might mean something more than lay within those dominions. But\r\nthere are many passages where Phthia is used without Hellas; and in\r\nthem all it is used to express the district where Peleus reigned. It\r\nis not unlikely therefore, at first sight, that Hellas has the limited\r\nsense of a part of the kingdom in these passages. And in the passage\r\nrelating to Bathycles, the son of Chalcon, the limited sense is yet\r\nmore strongly suggested; yet, as we may hereafter see more clearly, it\r\nis by no means positively required either in that or in any of these\r\nfour places.\r\n\r\nAnd it is abundantly clear, from the remainder of the passages, that\r\nthe name Hellas had already, in Homer’s time, begun to bear a more\r\nextended sense.\r\n\r\nIn proof of this, let us take, firstly, the two passages in which it\r\nstands alone. In Il. ix. 444-8, Phœnix tells us that nothing would\r\ninduce him to quit Achilles; no, not even if the gods, brushing off\r\nhis old age, were to make him young and vigorous again, such as he was\r\nwhen first he left Hellas, the land of fair women, flying from his\r\nfeud with his father Amyntor. Now this passage absolutely proves that\r\nthe word Hellas was used by Homer, at least occasionally, for some\r\nlimited district, and not (as in after times) for the entire country;\r\ninasmuch as Phœnix could not otherwise have said he _left_ Hellas on\r\nthis occasion. But on the other hand it demonstrates, that the limits\r\nof Hellas were not so narrow, as the passages heretofore considered\r\nmight permit us to suppose. For Phœnix goes on to describe the cause\r\nof quarrel; and (478-80) says he took his course _through_ broad\r\nopen Hellas, and came _into_ fertile Phthia, to Peleus the king. The\r\nsupposition most consistent with the wording of these passages is, that\r\nPhthia comprised the principal district of the dominions of Peleus,\r\nwhile a portion of them may have fallen (as we elsewhere see was\r\nperhaps the case) under the name of Hellas: but they absolutely place\r\nthe abode of Amyntor outside the realm of Peleus; and therefore, in\r\nsaying that Phœnix left Hellas, and that he fled from his home through\r\nHellas, they imply necessarily that Hellas, the region from which he\r\nfled, was, in part at least, outside of that realm to which he fled.\r\n\r\nBut these passages will harmonise perfectly with each other, and with\r\nthose formerly examined, if we suppose that Hellas meant the whole of\r\nNorthern Greece generally, but that a particular portion of it had been\r\nmore definitely stamped with the name of Phthia, as the chief seat of\r\nPeleus and the Myrmidons. For then the original abode of Phœnix might\r\nbe in Hellas, as he says (in ix. 447) that it was: and yet he would\r\npursue his way through Hellas, as he says (ibid. 478) that he did: and\r\nhe would also leave Hellas, namely by coming into Phthia: and moreover\r\nthe dominions of Peleus might go beyond what was commonly known by the\r\nparticular designation of Phthia, and might include some portion of\r\nHellas, as, from Il. ii. 683, they evidently did.\r\n\r\nThis supposition is recommended to us, not only by its conforming to\r\nall the requisite conditions, and furnishing a convenient construction\r\nfor all the passages we have examined, but by the fact that Phthia, and\r\nPhthia alone, is commonly mentioned in the poem as the home of Achilles\r\nand the Myrmidons: which shows that they had a more special relation to\r\nthe territory known by that name, than to Hellas.\r\n\r\nIf any thing be still wanting, the proof is brought to completeness by\r\ntwo other passages: the one (Il. x. 261-7), which tells us that this\r\nAmyntor, son of Ormenus, dwelt in Eleon; dwelt there permanently, since\r\nAutolycus stole from him an helmet, by breaking into his substantial\r\nwell-built house,\r\n\r\n    πύκινον δόμον ἀντιτορήσας[498]:\r\n\r\nand the other the verse of the Catalogue[499], which places Eleon in\r\nBœotia. These passages therefore clearly appear to carry the name\r\nHellas as far as Bœotia, and to make it reach continuously from thence\r\nto Phthia. And if Hellas comes down to Bœotia, then it includes\r\nLocris; and the various tribes of these regions may be included in\r\nthe general name of Hellenes, though to all appearance they were not\r\nas yet familiarly and ordinarily so called. And if Locris and Bœotia,\r\nwith part of Southern Thessaly (the dominions of Peleus), are included\r\nwithin the range of the name Hellas, we can have no difficulty in\r\nsupposing that it included Northern Thessaly also, which must have been\r\nthe pathway of the Helli to the South.\r\n\r\nBut we find Ἕλλας in another combination besides that with Phthia,\r\nin the four passages of the Odyssey, (one of them being a simple\r\nrepetition of another,) which we have still to examine.\r\n\r\nNow the line Od. iv. 726, repeated 816, is under suspicion, of which it\r\nis not worth while to scrutinise the justice: as the idea and force of\r\nit is just the same with that of Od. i. 344,\r\n\r\n    Ἀνδρὸς, τοῦ κλέος εὐρὺ καθ’ Ἑλλάδα καὶ μέσον Ἄργος.\r\n\r\nThis passage describes the fame of Ulysses as spread through the\r\nbreadth of Hellas and mid-Argos; (or, from the heart of Argos to its\r\nextremities, right through or _all over_ Argos.) And again in Od.\r\nxv. 80, when Telemachus has proposed to return home forthwith from\r\nthe court of Menelaus, his host gently dissuades him from haste, and\r\ncounsels a more extended tour, καθ’ Ἑλλάδα καὶ μέσον Ἄργος; offering\r\nto take charge of his horses, and to shew him ‘the cities,’ or secured\r\ndwellings, ‘of men.’\r\n\r\nThe signification of the word Ἄργος will be considered hereafter: for\r\nthe present purpose it is enough to observe that the word μέσον, as\r\nused by Menelaus, in combination with Hellas, of itself prevents our\r\napplying it simply to the narrow corner of the Peloponnesus in which\r\nthe city of Argos was placed; and therefore that it can scarcely mean\r\nless than Peloponnesus. And it is not less plain, that whatever may\r\nbe the force of the words when taken singly, their effect when taken\r\ntogether can hardly be less than this: Menelaus must mean to point to\r\nGreece at large, as the scene of the proposed excursion. For there is\r\nno assignable portion of Greece to which, consistently with the words\r\nand the sense, he can be held to confine his meaning. If we could\r\nsuppose him to mean Peloponnesus only by the two names Hellas and\r\nArgos, which he employs in this place, we should but enlarge thereby\r\nthe Homeric capacity of the word Hellas; for we have already brought it\r\ndown from the north to Bœotia; and we should, in the way now proposed,\r\ncarry it through the isthmus, and over Peloponnesus, or, at the least,\r\nover some part of it. But even if Menelaus means Peloponnesus only,\r\nwhich is most improbable, it is plainly incredible that such should be\r\nthe meaning of Penelope in Od. i. 344. As a Greek, she _cannot_ mean to\r\nlimit the renown of her husband to any sphere less wide than Greece.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen, that Hellas sometimes includes certainly the\r\nterritory from Southern Thessaly to Bœotia, and probably Thessaly at\r\nlarge: and it is quite plain that, if it comes to Bœotia, it does not\r\nstop there, but applies to the whole of Middle Greece, the region\r\nbetween Thessaly and the isthmus: for the application of the term\r\nHellas could not stop except at some great natural division of the\r\ncountry, and the isthmus is here the only one possible.\r\n\r\nNow the name Argos is related to Thessaly[500], but much more specially\r\nrelated to the Peloponnesus, as we shall see from a number of passages.\r\nIt has no relation at all in Homer to that division of the country in\r\nparticular which we call Middle Greece.\r\n\r\nAssuming it, then, to mean Peloponnesus, in that case Hellas means\r\nMiddle with Northern Greece: and the two names of Hellas and Argos,\r\ntaken together, completely and conveniently express the whole country.\r\nThe only alterations are such as would assign to Hellas a larger sense;\r\nin no case can it, as to this passage, admit of a more restricted one.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing argument is supported to a certain extent by the fact,\r\nthat while territorial names are frequent for the Peloponnesian part of\r\nGreece, (we have Achaic Argos, Iasian Argos, Elis, Arcadia, Lacedæmon,)\r\nthe continent to the north of the isthmus is generally without\r\nterritorial names: Phthia and Pelasgic Argos are, I think, the only\r\nexceptions. There is thus before us a gap, which the name Hellas, as it\r\nhas been here construed, seems conveniently to fill.\r\n\r\nThis construction of certain passages, in which the word Hellas is\r\ncontained, is not one which should be adopted by the reader unawares.\r\nBut if, like myself, after examining into it strictly he assents to\r\nits justice and necessity, then he will find that it is of the utmost\r\nimportance to the elucidation of Homeric history; for it supplies a key\r\nto other much contested uses of the Hellenic name.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, I submit that if we now review the ten passages\r\nin which Homer speaks of Hellas, and bear in mind that in some among\r\nthem it cannot be construed as meaning less than, with a certain amount\r\nof indeterminateness as to boundaries, Northern and Middle Greece\r\ngenerally, we shall also find, that there is not one of all those\r\npassages, in which it will not at least admit of the same sense. I\r\ndo not deny that it is open to us to hold that the Hellas, in which\r\nChalcon dwelt, was a mere district of Thessaly, and that Homer attaches\r\nin different places different senses to the word. But if there is a\r\nsense, substantially one, which will suit the word in every place\r\nwhere it is used, it seems most reasonable to adhere generally to\r\nthat sense. Such a meaning we have, I think, found for Hellas, in\r\nconcluding that it is used to signify Northern and Middle Greece. In\r\nthis sense it overrides and includes Phthia, as France overrides Alsace\r\nor Burgundy. But as there was a time when Alsace and Burgundy might,\r\nbefore the present state of incorporation, have been either said to be\r\nin France or not in France, without an outrageous license of speech\r\neither way, so perhaps the land of Phthia was for Homer either a part\r\nof Hellas, or a province carved out of Hellas by the special occupation\r\nof the Myrmidons, as occasion might chance to demand. Not that he\r\ndid not conform to the facts, but that the facts were themselves\r\nindeterminate. To our habits, under which every inch of ground belongs\r\nto somebody, this indefiniteness is wholly strange; but in times\r\nwhen only spots here and there were appropriated, and there was no\r\nuniversal occupation, it was thoroughly natural, and the thing really\r\nstrange would be the absence of it. Accordingly, when Phœnix says he\r\nleft Hellas, he gives to Phthia, the name of the place he reached,\r\nits exclusive force. When he says Chalcon dwelt in Hellas among the\r\nMyrmidons, he probably means in Phthia, but now regards Phthia as\r\ncovered by the larger designation. When Homer tells us the soldiers\r\nof Achilles were those who inhabited Alos, and Alope, and Trachin,\r\nand who occupied Phthia and Hellas, we understand by the three first,\r\nparticular spots which the Myrmidons had settled, by Phthia a larger\r\ndistrict which they had so far dotted with their occupancy as to make\r\nit peculiarly theirs, and by Hellas the surrounding country, into which\r\nthey had more or less ramified.\r\n\r\nAssuming then the sense of the word Hellas to be now sufficiently\r\nascertained, the next question is, how came this country, which has\r\nbeen described, to bear the name of Hellas? And the question admits of\r\nbut one answer. It could only be called Hellas because tribes of Helli\r\nhad become its masters, its governing race, the depositaries, through\r\nits various regions, of political and military power.\r\n\r\nWe must therefore understand that, according to Homer, tribes reputed\r\nto be of Hellic origin were so far distributed over this country, as to\r\nhave begun at least to affix their name to it: though without having\r\nabsolutely effaced every older name, like Πελασγικὸν Ἄργος and though\r\nnot precluding the introduction of names perhaps more recent, certainly\r\nmore specific, such as Phthia.\r\n\r\n_The Hellenes of Homer._\r\n\r\nWe may now proceed to consider the force, according to Homer’s use, of\r\nthe names derived from Hellas. These are, as commonly understood,\r\n\r\n1. Ἕλληνες,\r\n\r\n2. Πανέλληνες,\r\n\r\nand to these I shall presume to add,\r\n\r\n3. Κεφάλληνες.\r\n\r\nThe first of these is found only in Il. ii. 684. Here, after the\r\ndescription of the places from which the forces of Achilles came, the\r\npoet proceeds to give them their designation:\r\n\r\n    Μυρμίδονες δὲ καλεῦντο καὶ Ἕλληνες καὶ Ἀχαιοί.\r\n\r\nWe find an exclusive use[501] of the word Myrmidons for the force\r\nof Achilles throughout the Iliad, except in this one place;\r\nnotwithstanding that Phœnix, who was lord of the Dolopes, commanded one\r\nof the five divisions[502], and that we may therefore presume a certain\r\npart of the force to have been Dolopian. From this exclusive use, we\r\ncannot doubt that the name of Myrmidons was that which appertained to\r\nthem in particular, as the ruling tribe among the subjects of Peleus.\r\n\r\nHad we found reason to construe the word Ἕλλας in the preceding line as\r\nmeaning only a district of his dominions, it would have followed, that\r\nἝλληνες meant the inhabitants of that district; and that a part of the\r\nsoldiers of Achilles were Hellenes rather than Myrmidons, in virtue of\r\na local name. But it follows from what we have already concluded about\r\nHellas, that the name of Hellenes was applicable to all the Myrmidons\r\nas being themselves inhabitants of Hellas, that is, of Phthia, which\r\nbelonged to Hellas.\r\n\r\nAnd in passing it should be noticed that, although the Myrmidons\r\ninhabited Phthia, they are never called Phthians; nor do we ever hear\r\nof Phthians at all in Homer, except only in that passage where they\r\nare described as engaged with Locrians and others in repelling the\r\nTrojan assault[503]. They are there described as under the command of\r\nMedon and Podarces. But in the Catalogue Podarces and Medon[504], as\r\nsubstitutes for Protesilaus and Philoctetes respectively, command the\r\nsecond and fourth Thessalian contingents, which came from districts\r\nlying near the kingdom of Peleus. Either therefore the Phthian name\r\nextended beyond the limits of Phthia, or the Phthians were those\r\nwhom the Myrmidons had recently driven out, and whose lands they had\r\noccupied.\r\n\r\nWe cannot conclusively settle the sense of the word Ἀχαιοὶ in this\r\npassage, except by anticipating the results of an examination, on which\r\nwe have not yet entered. But it may be observed even at this point,\r\nthat the bearings of the passage are somewhat adverse to a merely\r\nlocal construction for it. If Myrmidon was the strictly proper name,\r\nthen Achæan must have been a designation which was not proper to the\r\nMyrmidons only, but which they enjoyed in common with others. And yet,\r\non the other hand, not in common with all the Greeks, but in some\r\nsense more restricted than that, in which it is habitually applied to\r\nthe whole army. For in that large and general sense every contingent\r\nof the army was Achæan, and Homer would certainly therefore not have\r\nmentioned the Achæan name with respect to one in particular. It can\r\nhardly escape observation that, studying great clearness and precision\r\nin the Catalogue, he systematically avoids the introduction of his\r\ngeneral names for the army. We never read of Danaans or Argeians in\r\nit at all, and of Achæans only twice[505]. So far then as the passage\r\nitself guides us, it points to the supposition that those who were\r\ncalled Myrmidons properly, to distinguish them from all others, and\r\nHellenes because they were (in common with others) inhabitants of\r\nHellas, belonged likewise to a particular class or race of Greeks, to\r\nwhom the name of Ἀχαιοὶ was applicable in some distinctive sense. The\r\nthree appellations, accordingly, are not so many synonyms; but each has\r\nprobably its own proper scope.\r\n\r\nThucydides[506] speaks with his usual accuracy, when he says that Homer\r\nhas given the name of Hellenes to no portion of the army except the\r\ntroops of Achilles from Phthiotis. He does not however go beyond the\r\nassertion that this word had not yet grown into an appellation for the\r\nGreeks universally, an assertion which, as far as Homer’s evidence\r\ngoes, is undeniable. But it does not require us also to deny that the\r\nHellas of Homer extends beyond Phthia, and that the name of Hellenes\r\nmay even then have been beginning to attach to the inhabitants of other\r\nparts of Hellas, though perhaps less fixedly, as yet, than to the\r\nMyrmidons.\r\n\r\n_The Panhellenes of Homer._\r\n\r\nWith these facts in view, I am wholly unable to follow those who have\r\ncondemned, upon internal evidence, that verse of the Catalogue in which\r\nwe find mention of the Panhellenes.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Oilean Ajax, commander of the Locrians, the poet says (Il.\r\nii. 530),\r\n\r\n    ἐγχείῃ δ’ ἐκέκαστο Πανέλληνας καὶ Ἀχαιούς.\r\n\r\nIt is not grammatically necessary that we should make these two words\r\ncoextensive; and I do not believe that either of them separately,\r\nas here used, conveys the whole force of the two, though perhaps\r\nconjointly they may carry the assertion that he was the best spearman\r\nin the army.\r\n\r\nIf there was a Hellas in the time of Homer, which was inhabited by a\r\nvariety of tribes, then, as these tribes dispersedly might be called\r\nwith propriety Hellenes, even apart from the authority of constant\r\nuse, so they might with equal propriety be combined into the term\r\nPanhellenes, which would mean all the tribes, including the Locrians,\r\nthat inhabited Hellas, or Northern and Mid-Greece. Thus, as the\r\nAchæan name was at this time more prominent and distinguished in the\r\nPeloponnesus[507] than in any other part of the country, the poet may\r\nin this place by Ἀχαιοὶ mean the Southern or Peloponnesian Greece; so\r\nas, by the two epithets conjointly, to signify the whole army. Or he\r\nmay mean all those who, in Hellas or beyond it, were of the pure Achæan\r\nrace (assuming, for the moment, that such a race existed); and thus may\r\nhere assert, that Ajax excelled all Hellas, and even all Achæans in or\r\nout of Hellas, using the last of the two words by way of climax. I do\r\nnot deny that he may also be construed to mean the whole host in the\r\ngross by Ἀχαιοὶ, agreeably to the common use of it; but this is less\r\nlikely; as the name, so understood, would not be distinctive.\r\n\r\nNor do I see any reason to hesitate about treating the Homeric name\r\nΚεφάλληνες as one of his Hellenic group of names. As in the case of\r\nΠελασγοὶ, so here we have a name formed by a combination of different\r\nwords. The word _head_ seems to have been represented by a root of\r\nflexible structure. In Sanscrit it is _kapâla_[508], in Greek κεφάλη,\r\nin Latin _caput_: but it also appears in the German _kopf_, and in the\r\nGreek κόπτειν, ‘to butt,’ and in κύβη, κυβιστάω, κυβερνάω. The word\r\nΚεφάλληνες seems, then, to be formed in the most direct manner from the\r\nroot κεφ, signifying ‘head,’ and Ἕλληνες: and thus it both attaches\r\nUlysses, with at least the dominant race among his subjects, to the\r\nHellic stock, and indicates the tendency of the Hellenic name, even in\r\nHomer’s time, to reproduce itself and to spread abroad.\r\n\r\nAgain, we observe in his rare use of Κεφάλληνες the same signs as in\r\nἝλληνες and Πανέλληνες, that the power of the name was only growing up\r\nfrom its infancy. For the word is used but twice in the Iliad, and no\r\nmore than four times in the Odyssey, where there is constant occasion\r\nfor addressing, or for speaking of, the subjects of Ulysses. We find in\r\nthat poem Ἰθακήσιοι eleven times, and Ἀχαιοὶ constantly.\r\n\r\nHaving dealt with the Homeric derivations of Hellas[509], let us now\r\nascend to the word, from which it is itself derived; Hellas being\r\nevidently, in the Greek tongue, the country which had been occupied by\r\nthe Helli.\r\n\r\nOf the people who are so termed, either under the form beginning with\r\nthe aspirate, or else under that of Σελλοὶ, we find obvious Homeric\r\nvestiges in the Hellespont, Ἑλλήσποντος; in various rivers termed\r\nΣελληείς; and in the invocation of Achilles to Jupiter, which places\r\nthe Selli in the north of Thessaly, about wintry Dodona, and seems to\r\nstamp them as then still remaining a people of the rudest habits in\r\ntheir mountain home[510];\r\n\r\n    Δωδώνης μεδέων δυσχειμέρου· ἀμφὶ δὲ Σελλοὶ\r\n    σοὶ ναίουσ’ ὑποφῆται ἀνιπτόποδες, χαμαιεῦναι.\r\n\r\n_The Σελλοὶ of Homer._\r\n\r\nThe word Ἕλλοι would appear to be not the most probable reading of\r\nthe text of this invocation; for it presumes an inconvenient loading\r\nof the sentence with the double pronoun σε and σοι. But there can be\r\nno doubt whatever as to its identity with Σελλοί. Independently of\r\nphilological argument, there is the strongest presumption that in this\r\nplace Achilles intends to name his own national ancestry, as being the\r\nministers of the god; who give him, as it were, the right to invoke\r\nthe aid of the Pelasgic indeed, but therefore genuine and original,\r\nJupiter of Dodona. But no circumstance seems to be better established\r\nby philological research, than that in many cases of Greek words,\r\nwhich now begin with the aspirate, there was one (or more than one)\r\ninitial letter, and that frequently that letter was the _sigma_. Much\r\nobscurity has hung about this subject, from the fact that discovery has\r\nproceeded piecemeal, and that for a length of time the word _digamma_\r\nwas used to signify what had originally filled the void now existing\r\nin so many places of the Homeric versification. What this _digamma_\r\nmight have been was disputed; but it was, almost insensibly perhaps,\r\nassumed to be some one letter or sound only. But as inquiry has made\r\nfurther advances, many forms of a lost letter or letters have been\r\ndiscovered: and it has also been made clear that the gaps ought to be\r\nfilled up variously, and not by any one uniform expedient. To take\r\nvery simple examples, there can be no doubt about the identity of\r\nἓξ, ἕπτα, ὓς, with _sex_, _septem_, _sus_: nor any doubt about the\r\nessential identity of ὕδωρ and _sudor_, ἡδὺς and _suavis_, ἑκυρὸς and\r\n_socer_: none therefore that the σ ought to be supplied, and not _f_,\r\n_w_, or _v_, in the passage φίλε ἑκυρέ[511]. While indeed a presumption\r\narises[512] from the German words _schwieger_ and _schwäger_, that a\r\ndouble or even treble loss may have occurred, and that the passage may\r\nhave run φίλε σϝεκυρέ. Under these circumstances, in the case before\r\nus, where we have both forms represented, there can be no hesitation as\r\nto the identity of Ἑλλοὶ and Σελλοί: the first represented in Ἕλλας,\r\nἝλληνες, Ἑλλήσποντος, and the Ἑλλοπία of Hesiod: the other and older\r\none supported by Σελληείς.\r\n\r\nThere is another curious and instructive case, in which we have\r\nthe older form of the word Σελλοὶ still remaining: besides that of\r\nΠροσέληνοι, to which allusion has already been made in considering\r\nthe case of the Pelasgian Arcadians. In the Birds of Aristophanes,\r\nthe dramatist satirizes Athens and the Sicilian Expedition, under the\r\nname of a city in the clouds, called Νεφελοκοκκυγία; the object being\r\nto expose the arrogance of great pretensions, without adequate means\r\nto support them. There, he says, lie most of the goods of Theagenes,\r\nand all those of Æschines. This Theagenes was called κάπνος, smoke,\r\nbecause he promised much, and did nothing. Æschines was a pauper,\r\nwho pretended to wealth. The Scholiast adds, ἦν δὲ Αἰσχίνης Σελλοῦ.\r\nἜλεγον δὲ ἐκ μεταφορᾶς τοιούτους Σελλούς· καὶ τὸ ἀλαζονεύεσθαι δὲ,\r\nσελλίζειν[513]. Cary thinks the term σελλίζειν came from a Sellus, the\r\nfather of this Æschines. But in the first place, it seems difficult\r\nto rely on the Scholiast for knowing, still less for recording with\r\naccuracy, the name of the father of an obscure person, who had lived\r\nin the age of Aristophanes. In the second place, if Æschines was an\r\nobscure fellow, it is most improbable that his father’s name should\r\nhave become the root of a Greek word descriptive of a particular\r\nhabit or propensity. Such words (for example) as hectoring and\r\nrhodomontading presuppose a great celebrity in the person on whose\r\nname they are based. Lastly, the derivation from the ancient Σελλοὶ\r\nseems a perfectly natural one, and also adequate to the case. It is\r\nin some degree characteristic of those who in reduced circumstances\r\ntrace back their lineage to a very ancient stock, instead of relying\r\nsimply on the substantial honour of their descent, still to affect the\r\npossession of the wealth which has passed away from them: to play for\r\nthemselves the part, which Caleb Balderstone desires to play, on behalf\r\nnot of himself, but of the Master of Ravenswood, in Scott’s ‘Bride\r\nof Lammermoor’; and altogether to be sensitive, or what is called\r\ntouchy on the subject, and to lean on the whole towards a certain\r\nboastfulness, in common with the νεοπλοῦτοι at the other extremity of\r\nthe scale. There is a broad distinction between treating the Scholiast\r\nas a witness to the existence and force of a current phrase, and the\r\ntaking his word for the parentage of a nobody, like this Æschines,\r\nwho had lived long before him. It may, however, not be necessary to\r\nconstrue σελλίζειν solely, or even specially, with reference to a pride\r\nin wealth which had passed away. If we shall hereafter show for the\r\nSelli[514] a Persian ancestry, then, even without any regard to change\r\nof circumstances, the phrase at once leads us back to the description\r\ngiven by Herodotus of the Persians their forefathers. Πέρσαι, φύσιν\r\nἐόντες ὑβρισταὶ, εἰσὶν ἀχρήματοι[515].\r\n\r\nI shall also have occasion to notice hereafter one or two other words\r\napparently akin to Σελλοί.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[497] Lit.

VII.\r\n\r\n_On the respective contributions of the Pelasgian and Hellenic factors\r\nto the compound of the Greek nation._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Contributions to the mythology._\r\n\r\nIn this attempt at an ethnological survey, we have now come down to the\r\npoint, at which the Greek Peninsula passes over from its old Pelasgian\r\ncharacter, and becomes subject to predominating Hellenic influences.\r\n\r\nNow therefore, and before we examine the relations and succession of\r\nthe great Homeric appellations for the Hellenes, appears to be the\r\ntime for considering how the account stands between these tribes and\r\nthe Pelasgians, and what were, so far as by probable evidence we can\r\nascertain it, the respective contributions from the two sources to the\r\nintegral character of the Greeks and of their institutions.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Greece, as it is known to us in history, we have the\r\nmost remarkable disproportion between moral and physical power, and\r\nbetween the green and the full grown product, which is offered to\r\nview in the whole range of human experience. A circumscribed country,\r\nwith a small population, throws forth, without loss of vital power,\r\nto the East and to the West, colonies greatly transcending itself, as\r\nwould appear, in wealth and population; continues for many centuries\r\nto exercise a primary influence in the world; at one time resists and\r\nrepels, at another invades and terrifies, at a third overthrows and\r\ncrushes to atoms the great colossus of Eastern empire, and continues\r\nto exercise, through the medium of mind, a singular mastery, enduring\r\ndown to our own time, and likely still to endure, over civilized man.\r\nAnd even the miniature organization of Greece presents to us, within\r\nits own limits, diversities of character almost enough for a quarter of\r\nthe globe.\r\n\r\nMany of these diversities connect themselves with the ethnological\r\nformation of the different communities. In the course of that process,\r\nso far as can be discerned, certain admixtures of foreign influence\r\nwere supplied direct from Phœnicia, Egypt, or elsewhere: but the grand\r\ncomponent parts or factors in this composite product are two, the\r\nHellenic and the Pelasgic. To this dual combination, perhaps the double\r\ninvocation of Achilles (Il. xvi. 233, 4) is a witness.\r\n\r\nThe development of the national character is the most large and varied\r\nin Attica, where the population, from successive immigrations of\r\nbodies of refugees, and from the free general resort and reception of\r\nstrangers, presented also the largest and most varied ethnical compound.\r\n\r\nIn analysing that national character which thus resulted from the\r\namalgamation of ingredients chiefly Hellic and Pelasgic, we have now to\r\nask how far its different elements are referable to the Pelasgic or to\r\nthe Hellic root respectively? We have traced in some degree the course\r\nand local circumscription of the races: can we affiliate upon them any\r\nof the contributions which they severally made to the varied manners\r\nand to the institutions of Greece?\r\n\r\nThe proof, as far as it is specific, can be only that which probable\r\nand conjectural evidence afford: but that evidence is supported by the\r\nfact, that it tends, as a whole, to an orderly result.\r\n\r\nWhile they proceed from different sources, and present visible and\r\neven permanent distinctions of character, there is no violent disparity\r\nbetween the Hellic and the Pelasgic races: they afford a good material\r\nfor coalescence. We are not to suppose that whatever the one had,\r\nthe other had not. Of what belongs historically to the Pelasgi, much\r\nmay stand as theirs only through their priority of entrance into the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nI propose to inquire what evidence can be drawn, either from\r\nphilological sources, or from the text of Homer, to throw light on the\r\nseveral pursuits and tendencies of these races, under the heads of\r\nReligion, Policy, War, the Games, Poetry, the Chase, and Navigation.\r\n\r\nUnder some of these heads, however, we must in a measure anticipate\r\nresults which will be only obtained in full from later inquiries.\r\n\r\nThe Poems afford us no complete and decisive test for discriminating\r\nbetween the Hellene and the Pelasgian contributions respectively to the\r\nGreek religion.\r\n\r\nWe shall, however, hereafter find many details of evidence bearing upon\r\nthis subject.\r\n\r\nFor the present I must confine myself to two very general propositions,\r\nwhich are founded on the relations of the Greek religion with those of\r\nTroy and of Italy.\r\n\r\nFirst, there seems to be a presumption, which may weigh with us to\r\na certain extent in the absence of counter-evidence, that those\r\nparts of the Greek religion which were common to the Greeks with the\r\nTrojans were Pelasgian, and that those which were not common, were not\r\nPelasgian. But of the parts which were common, and therefore Pelasgian,\r\nmany may have been originally Hellene too.\r\n\r\nAgain, a relationship subsists between Greece and Italy, as to the\r\ncomponent parts of their respective populations, which, without being\r\nunduly strained, will throw considerable light upon the question of\r\nHellic and Pelasgic attributes.\r\n\r\nThe Greek or the Italian of the classic times could not be expected\r\nto own relationship with what lay to the northward, on each of those\r\ntwo peninsulas. The Roman, therefore, whose investigations led him\r\nto suppose there were Pelasgians in Italy, would only derive them\r\nfrom Greece. For us the case stands far otherwise; and we must simply\r\nconsider the Pelasgians of Greece, and the Pelasgians of Italy, as two\r\namong a variety of branches, which struck out at different times from\r\nthe main trunk of an extended race, probably diffusing itself over\r\nmany parts of Asia and Europe. In Greece and Italy respectively these\r\nPelasgic tribes entered into new combinations, probably not wholly\r\ndifferent, nor, on the other hand, by any means in exact correspondence.\r\n\r\nWe may perhaps be found not to go beyond the limits of the modesty\r\nwhich the case requires, when we simply lay down this rule: that\r\ncorrespondences in religion or in language between Greece and ancient\r\nItaly raise a presumption, that those features of each country, in\r\nwhich the correspondence is observed, are of Pelasgic origin.\r\n\r\nSomething of such correspondence we may perceive in regard to religion.\r\nThe religion of Homeric Greece differs from that of Rome, not only\r\nas to minor deities, but in the names given to many of the greater\r\ndeities, and especially in the far more imaginative character of its\r\ntraditions.\r\n\r\nThose parts of the religion of Greece and Rome which were common to\r\nboth were probably Pelasgian.\r\n\r\nLet us take first the names which correspond, and then those which are\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\n(I.) Names of deities that correspond in the Greek and Latin tongues:\r\n\r\n  1. Ζεύς            Deus.\r\n  2. Ζεὺς-πάτηρ      Jupiter.\r\n  3. Ἀπόλλων         Apollo.\r\n  4. Ἱστιή           Vesta.\r\n  5. Λήτω            Latona.\r\n  6. Περσεφόνη       Proserpina.\r\n  7. Ἄρης            Mars or Mavors.\r\n\r\n(II.) Names of deities which do not in any manner correspond in the\r\nGreek and Latin tongues:\r\n\r\n  1. Ἥρη         Juno.\r\n  2. Ποσειδὼν    Neptune.\r\n  3. Ἀιδώνευς    Pluto.\r\n  4. Ἀθήνη       Minerva.\r\n  5. Ἥφαιστος    Vulcan.\r\n  6. Ἑρμῆς       Mercury.\r\n  7. Ἀφροδίτη    Venus.\r\n  8. Ἄρτεμις     Diana.\r\n  9. Δημήτηρ     Ceres.\r\n  10. Διόνυσος   Bacchus.\r\n\r\nTwo remarks may be made on the deities of the first list.\r\n\r\nFirst, that it comprehends generally the gods whom we shall find to\r\nbear marks of being the most ancient among the Greek deities; with the\r\nmarked exception, however, of Minerva[516].\r\n\r\nSecondly, that in it we find no deity who takes part on the Greek,\r\nthat is, the Pelasgian side, in the war of Troy. The only two names\r\nwhich do not appear on the Trojan side, are Vesta, who with Homer is\r\nnot personified at all: and Proserpine, who from the seat of her dark\r\ndominion could not share in the wars waged upon earth.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when we turn to the second list of exclusively Greek\r\nnames, we find that it contains all the deities who took part against\r\nTroy: and only two very secondary names of deities friendly to it.\r\n\r\nMars and Venus, both engaged on the Trojan side, and one standing in\r\nthe first list, are the deities after whom, according to Ovid[517], the\r\ntwo first months of the Roman year were named in the first age of the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nIt would not, however, be safe to depend implicitly upon the apparent\r\nreappearance of certain names in the Latin language, without a fuller\r\nknowledge of the laws of discrimination between the early mythology\r\nof the Romans, and the form which their religious system assumed at\r\nthe period when they came into free communication with Greece and its\r\ncolonies, from which, as they certainly borrowed some names of deities,\r\nsuch as Pallas and Phœbus, so they may have assumed others too. We have\r\nno proof, for example, that Apollo was prominent, or even that he was\r\nknown, in the earliest Roman worship. Cicero[518] says, _Jam Apollinis\r\nnomen est Græcum_. Still, a temple was raised to him in Rome[519] as\r\nearly as 430 B. C.; and the Trojan sympathies of most of the deities\r\nin the first list tend in some degree to show both that they were well\r\nknown in the Pelasgian religion, and that many of the older portions\r\nof the mythology were common to the Trojans, the early Romans, and the\r\nPelasgians of Greece.\r\n\r\n_Pelasgian Religion less imaginative._\r\n\r\nWe may more boldly rely upon a general indication, which is offered to\r\nus by the religious systems both of Rome and of Troy, in comparison\r\nwith that of Greece.\r\n\r\nThe large account of Roman deities furnished by Saint Augustine, in\r\nhis ‘De Civitate Dei,’ constitutes for us the principal representation\r\nof the great work of Varro, now lost, on the ‘Antiquitates Rerum\r\nDivinarum.’ Notwithstanding the multitudinous development of the\r\ntheurgic system, the ‘_De Civitate_’ tends to support the belief that\r\nit was not vivified, like the system of the Greeks, by the intense\r\npervading power of a vigorous and prolific imagination. The ‘Fasti’ of\r\nOvid may perhaps be referred to as sustaining the same opinion. And\r\nHeyne in his commentary on Virgil has observed upon the comparative\r\ndulness and dryness of the early mythology of Rome: _Italici mythi\r\nlonge a Græcæ fabulæ suavitate absunt; nec varietas grata inest_[520].\r\n\r\nIn a later portion of this work[521] I shall endeavour to show, that\r\na similar character apparently attaches to the religious system of\r\nTroy: not so much a purity or simplicity, as a comparative poverty\r\nand hardness; and an indisposition in the inventions to assume those\r\ngraceful forms, of which the Grecian Theo-mythology, as exhibited in\r\nHomer, is so full.\r\n\r\nAnd again, when we pass from Homer to Hesiod, we find a great mass\r\nof religious fable, either added by the later poet, or grown up in\r\nthe interval between the two. Hesiod’s depositories are much more\r\nnumerously peopled: but we have passed at once from the poetry of a\r\ntheogony to its merest prose, when we compare his manner of touch or\r\nhandling, and his ideas on these subjects, with those of Homer. And, as\r\non other grounds we may consider Hesiod to represent the Pelasgian side\r\nof the Greek mind, we seem justified in referring the distinctive tone\r\nof his mythology in some degree to his Pelasgian characteristics.\r\n\r\nBut independently of confirmation from the case of Troy, and from\r\nthe tone of Hesiod, the character of the old Italian mythology, so\r\ndevoid of imagination, force, and grace, leads us to ascribe these\r\nproperties, when we find them abound in the Greek supernaturalism, to\r\nits non-Pelasgian, that is, to its Hellenic source.\r\n\r\n_Its ritual development fuller._\r\n\r\nWhen, however, we turn to another form of development in religious\r\nsystems, we find the case entirely different: I mean the development\r\nin positive observances of all kinds, and in fixed institutions of\r\nproperty and class. Here the religion of Rome was large and copious.\r\nPolybius has left upon record, in a most remarkable passage, his\r\nadmiration of the Roman system of δεισιδαιμονία, which had, he says,\r\nbeen so got up, and carried to such a point, that it could not be\r\nexceeded. It was all done, in his opinion, on account of the multitude.\r\nWere States composed of the wise, the case would have been different:\r\nbut as the people are full of levity and passion, λείπεται τοῖς ἀδήλοις\r\nφόβοις καὶ τῇ τοιαύτῃ τραγωδίᾳ τὰ πλήθη συνέχειν[522].\r\n\r\nNot less remarkable is the testimony of Dionysius; who, while he\r\npraises Romulus for the severe simplicity of what he caused to be\r\ntaught and held concerning religion, and for the expulsion of immoral\r\nfables and practices, says that he arranged for his people all that\r\nconcerned the temples of the gods, their consecrated lands, their\r\naltars, their images, their forms, their _insignia_, their prerogatives\r\nand their gifts to man, the sacrifices in which they delight, the\r\nfeasts and assemblies to be celebrated, and the remissions of labour\r\nto be granted in their honour. In no other newly founded city could be\r\nshown such a multitude of priests and ministers of the gods[523], who\r\nwere chosen, too, from the most distinguished families[524].\r\n\r\nThe Fasti of Ovid give an idea of the manner in which the Roman\r\nCalendar brought the ceremonial of religion to bear upon the course\r\nof life. For some centuries an acquaintance with the Calendar was the\r\nexclusive property of the sacred order[525]; and the priesthood turned\r\nto its own power and profit the knowledge, which afterwards filled the\r\npages of that characteristic work.\r\n\r\nAgain, we shall have occasion, when considering the distinctive\r\ncharacter of Troy, to notice that the political and ritual forms of\r\nreligion appear to have been much more advanced there, than with the\r\nGreeks. This difference will naturally connect itself with the stronger\r\nPelasgian infusion in the former case. We shall then find that of the\r\ntwo great kinds of sacred office, one only, that of the μάντις, and not\r\nthat of the priest, seems at the time of Homer to have appertained to\r\nthe Hellenic races.\r\n\r\nAnd it is not a little curious to observe that, when Saint Paul\r\narrives among the Athenians, the point which he selects for notice\r\nin their character and usages, after all the intermixtures they had\r\nundergone, is still this, that they are δεισιδαιμονέστεροι[526],\r\npeculiarly disposed to religious observances; and that, not contented\r\nwith the gods whom they suppose themselves to know, they have likewise\r\na supernumerary altar for ‘the Unknown God.’ Nor are we the less\r\nwarranted to connect this peculiarity with the original and long\r\npreserved Pelasgian character of Athens, because that city had, for\r\ncenturies before, become a peculiarly apt representative of the full\r\nGreek compound: for a system of ritual observance has a fixity,\r\nwhich does not belong to mere opinion; and, when once rooted in a\r\ncountry, has powerful tendencies to assume such a solidity as survives\r\nvicissitude: perhaps in some degree on account of its neutral and\r\npacific character, and of the power it leaves to men of separating\r\nbetween outward observance and inward act.\r\n\r\nAlthough the opinion has been entertained, that from the earliest ages\r\nit was the exclusive privilege of the first-born to offer sacrifice,\r\nit appears most probable that the separate function of priesthood was,\r\nlike other offices and professions, one of gradual formation. Whether\r\nthe primitive institution of sacrifice was spontaneous or commanded,\r\nevery man, that is to say, every head of a family, was, I shall assume,\r\nat first his own offerer or priest[527]. Then, as the household\r\ndeveloped into the community, the priestly office, in the first stages\r\nof political society, as a matter of course appertained to the chief.\r\n\r\nHe, by the necessity of natural order, originally united in his own\r\nperson the great functions of\r\n\r\n  1. Father.\r\n  2. Teacher.\r\n  3. Priest.\r\n  4. King.\r\n  5. Proprietor.\r\n  6. Commander.\r\n\r\nThe severance of these offices successively would arrive sooner or\r\nlater, according as the progress made in numbers and wealth was rapid\r\nor slow. Concentration of employments in a single hand marks the\r\nprimitive condition or retarded movement of society, while the division\r\nof labour is the sign of more speedy and more advanced development.\r\nEven the annals of the people of Israel furnish instances in which\r\nwe trace, at periods when these offices had undergone division under\r\ndivine authority, vestiges of their former union. It appears that,\r\nbesides Moses, who consecrated Aaron and his sons by divine command,\r\nJoshua, Samuel, and Saul[528] on certain occasions offered sacrifice.\r\nThe exclusive character of priesthood has been impressed upon it,\r\nunder Divine Revelation, by positive ordinance, and for a special\r\npurpose[529].\r\n\r\n_Order of Priests not Hellenic._\r\n\r\nThe Hellenes in Homer appear to exhibit it in its earlier state\r\nof union with the office of civil government; and the Pelasgians\r\nto display it as a function which has indeed become special and\r\nprofessional, but only on that self-acting principle which, in the\r\nprogress of society, leads to division of labour.\r\n\r\nIf we suppose the case of two races, one of them inhabiting a rude and\r\nbarren country in a state of perpetual poverty and warfare, and then\r\nrecently, by a descent upon more fertile soils, brought into contact\r\nwith civilised life: the other of them addicted from a much earlier\r\nperiod to pursuits of peace and industry, inhabiting plains, and\r\naccustomed to form agricultural settlements; there will be no cause\r\nfor wonder upon our also finding that the latter of these races has\r\na professional priesthood, while the former has none; but that the\r\nsacrificial office remains in the private dwelling with the father\r\nof the family, and on public occasions with the head of the civil\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThis appears to have been the state of facts as between the Trojans\r\nof Homer who had a priesthood, and the Hellenes who had none: and the\r\ndifference may be principally referable to the different condition\r\nand history of the Pelasgian and the Hellic races: while other\r\ncauses, belonging to the respective characters of the races, may have\r\ncontributed their share towards the production of this curious result.\r\nPartly the greater personal energy and self-reliance of the Hellic\r\ntribes, but partly also the earlier and older ease, wealth, and fixity\r\nof the Pelasgians, are the probable reasons why, at the point of time\r\nexhibited in the writings of Homer, we find priesthood properly a\r\nPelasgian, but not yet properly an Hellenic, and only to a limited\r\nextent an adoptive, institution.\r\n\r\nThus far, then, we have a presumption, to be greatly strengthened\r\nas I trust hereafter, that the Greek religion owed to the Hellenes\r\nits imaginative, and to the Pelasgians its sacerdotal and ceremonial\r\ndevelopment. And this presumption is, I think, in entire accordance\r\nwith what we should reasonably anticipate, from relations otherwise\r\nknown to have subsisted between the two races. I now pass on to the\r\nsubject of language.\r\n\r\n_Contributions to language._\r\n\r\nIn attempting to illustrate the relations of Pelasgians to Hellenes\r\nthrough the medium of the affinities and contrasts between the Greek\r\nand Latin languages, I am aware that I venture upon ground which\r\nrequires to be trodden with great circumspection. For the Latin nation\r\nmay possibly have contained within itself some ethnical element not\r\ndissimilar to the Hellenic, as well as one substantially corresponding\r\nwith the Pelasgian, factor of the Greek people. And again, there is a\r\nvery extended relation of the two languages to a common root in the\r\nSanscrit. The number of words traceable to such a root has recently\r\nbeen stated at 339 in the Greek, and 319 in the Latin tongues[530]. We\r\nmust not then, it will justly be observed, infer from the simple fact\r\nof resemblance between a Greek and a Latin word, that the one has been\r\nborrowed or directly modified from the other.\r\n\r\nLet us begin by considering the just effect of these remarks, and\r\ninquiring whether they do not still leave space enough for an useful\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nI begin from the assumption, that there was a deep and broad Pelasgian\r\n_substratum_ both in the Greek and the Roman nations. It is thought,\r\nand it may perhaps be justly thought, that a dominant tribe of Oscans,\r\nwho were a nation of warriors and hunters, came among the Pelasgi of\r\nItaly, as the Hellenes came among the Pelasgi of Greece. But while we\r\nmay properly assume the identity of the Pelasgian factor in the two\r\ncases respectively, it is quite plain that the compounds or aggregate\r\ncharacters are broadly distinguished, and represent an assemblage and\r\nadmixture either of different qualities, or else of the same qualities\r\nin very different proportions. Therefore we are justified in laying\r\nit down as a general rule, that whatever is found in the language of\r\nthe two countries alike was most probably Pelasgian: since, if that\r\nportion of the aggregate language had been supplied from those elements\r\nin which the nations differed, it is likely that a corresponding\r\ndifference would have been found to prevail between their modes of\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\nAgain, I think we must distinguish between the simple fact of\r\nderivation from an original source in common, and those degrees or\r\ndescriptions of resemblance which show that any given words not only\r\nhad one source at first, but that they continued together up to a\r\ncertain point in the formative process, so as to be capable, from their\r\nshape, of derivation, not only from that root, but also one from the\r\nother. For instance, the Greek ἐγὼ and the Latin _ego_ are both stated\r\nto be derived from the Sanscrit _aham_. But here it is quite plain that\r\nthey have not only set out from the same point, but travelled along\r\nthe same road to their journey’s end, as the Greek and Latin words are\r\nidentical. On the other hand, if we take the Greek τέσσαρες, and the\r\nLatin _quatuor_, both are referred to the same Sanscrit root, _chatur_:\r\nbut neither of them can well have been derived from the other, and each\r\nis more nearly related to the root than it is to the other. Or if we\r\ntake the Latin _anser_, the Greek χὴν, and the English ‘goose,’ these\r\nwords scarcely appear to have a connecting link: but it is found, and\r\na remote or mediate connection established, by means of the German\r\n_gans_. Instances might easily be multiplied.\r\n\r\nIn single cases, where the relationship of words is only of the kind\r\nlast exemplified, it would not be safe to draw inferences to the\r\neffect of their being respectively due to this or that element in the\r\ncomposition of the nation.\r\n\r\nBut where there is such a similarity as to show either that the word\r\nhas advanced nearly to its mature state before the Greek and Latin\r\nforms began to divaricate, or that the Latin form may have been derived\r\nfrom the Greek in an early stage of the history of the language, or\r\n_vice versâ_, then it seems just to refer the resemblance of terms to\r\nthe existence of a powerful common element in the two peoples.\r\n\r\nAnd further, if we shall find that the words standing in close kindred\r\nare capable of classification with reference to their sense, then, when\r\nwe have once constituted a class of such words, it may be justifiable\r\nto add fresh words to it on the strength of a more remote affinity,\r\nin virtue of the presumption already created. For instance, if the\r\nnames of the commonest objects and operations of inanimate nature are\r\ngenerally in close correspondence, we may infer a relation between\r\nother words which are in the same class as to meaning, though they may\r\nbe not so nearly alike, with more confidence than if the reasoning\r\nas to this latter section were not supported by the former. On this\r\nprinciple I proceed in the collections of words given below.\r\n\r\nOf course the utmost care must be taken to exclude those words which\r\nhave been copied from Greek into Latin, after the literary ages of Rome\r\nhad begun, and according to the practice which Horace has described and\r\nrecommended[531].\r\n\r\n_Niebuhr’s propositions._\r\n\r\nNiebuhr was, I believe, the first person to draw from philological\r\nsources a conclusion as to the character and habits of the Pelasgians.\r\nHe proceeded upon the threefold assertion, (1) that the words common\r\nto the two tongues are presumably Pelasgian, (2) that they for the\r\nmost part refer to tillage and the gentler ways of life, and (3) that\r\nwe may hence conclude that the Pelasgians were a people given to peace\r\nand husbandry. And conversely, that the words which widely differ in\r\nthe two tongues are not Pelasgian, and that the pursuits which they\r\nindicate must have been more peculiarly characteristic of some other\r\nrace, that contributed to make up the composition of the Roman nation.\r\nThe principles thus assumed by Niebuhr[532] appear, when placed under\r\ndue limitation, to be sound; and the only question is, whether they are\r\nsupported by the facts of the case. If in a given language we find the\r\nwords indicative of a certain turn of life to have been derived from a\r\nparticular race, which forms part of the nation speaking that language,\r\nwhile other words, referable to other habits and pursuits, have been\r\nsupplied by other races also numbered among its constituent parts, it\r\nis just to read the characters of those races respectively through the\r\ncharacter of the words that they contribute to the common tongue. For\r\nthe question is really one of forces which may have been adjusted with\r\nas much accuracy, as if they had been purely mechanical. The ordinary\r\nreason why a word of Pelasgian origin prevails over a word of Hellenic\r\norigin with the same signification, or the reverse, is that it is in\r\nmore or in less common use: and the commonness of use is likely to be\r\ndetermined by the degree in which the employment or state of life, with\r\nwhich the word is connected, may belong to the one race or the other.\r\n\r\nThe survey taken by Niebuhr appears to have been rapid; and the list\r\nof words supplied by him is very meagre. Bishop Marsh[533] and other\r\nauthors have, with a variety of views, supplied further materials. The\r\nmost comprehensive list, to which my attention has been directed, is\r\nin the ‘Lateinische Synonyme und Etymologieen’ of Döderlein[534]. The\r\nsubject is essentially one which hardly admits of a fixed criterion or\r\nauthoritative rule, or of a full assurance that its limits have been\r\nreached. Mindful of the reserve which these considerations recommend, I\r\nshould not wish to lay down inflexible propositions. But I venture to\r\nstate generally, that those words of the Latin and Greek tongues, which\r\nare in the closest relationship, are connected\r\n\r\n1. With the elementary structure of language, such as pronouns,\r\nprepositions, numerals.\r\n\r\n2. With the earliest state of society.\r\n\r\n3. With the pursuits of peaceful and rural industry, not of highly\r\nskilled labour.\r\n\r\n_Classes of words which agree._\r\n\r\nExamples, numerous enough to show a most extensive agreement, will\r\nreadily suggest themselves under the first head. To illustrate the\r\nother propositions, though it can only be done imperfectly, I will\r\nfollow both the positive and the negative methods. The first, by\r\ncomparing words which denote elementary objects, both of animate\r\nand inanimate nature, or the simplest products of human labour for\r\nthe supply of human wants, or the members of the human body, or the\r\nrudiments of social order. The second, by contrasting the words which\r\nrelate (1) to intelligence and mental operations, (2) to war, and (3)\r\nto the metals, the extended use of which denotes a certain degree of\r\nsocial advancement. It will I hope be borne in mind, on the one hand,\r\nthat these lists are given by way of instance, and have no pretension\r\nto be exhaustive: and, on the other hand, that exceptions, discovered\r\nhere and there, to the rule they seem to indicate, would in no way\r\ndisprove its existence, but should themselves, if purely exceptions, be\r\ntreated, provisionally at least, as accidental.\r\n\r\n\r\nClass I.--_Elementary objects of inanimate Nature._\r\n\r\n  ἔρα, terra\r\n  ἀήρ, aer\r\n  αἴθηρ, æther\r\n  αὖρα, aura\r\n  ἀστήρ    {astrum\r\n  ἀστέρος  {stella\r\n           {sterula\r\n  κοίλον, cælum\r\n  ἥλιος, sol\r\n  σε-λήνη, luna\r\n  νὺξ, nox\r\n  (Ζεὺς) Διὸς, dies\r\n  πόντος, pontus\r\n  ἃλς       } sal\r\n  θάλασσα   } salum\r\n  πόλος, polus\r\n  λυκὴ in λυκάβας,   } lux\r\n  λεύσσειν           }\r\n  χείμων, hyems\r\n  ἔαρ, ver\r\n  ὥρη, hora\r\n  ἑσπέρα, vesper\r\n  νέφος             {nubes\r\n                    {nebula\r\n  (νιψ) νιφος, nix, nivis\r\n  δρόσος, ros\r\n  ὕετος             {fluvius\r\n                    {pluvia\r\n  ῥῖγος, frigus\r\n  χάμαι, humus\r\n  πευκὴ, pix\r\n  κῆπος    } sepes\r\n  σῆκος    }\r\n  λακκὸς    } (_a pit_), lacus\r\n  λάχυς     }\r\n  ἄμπελος, pampinus\r\n  ὕλη, sylva\r\n  φύλλον, folium\r\n  ῥόδον, rosa\r\n  λαὰς, lapis\r\n  ἄγρος, ager\r\n  ἄρουρα, arvum\r\n  ἄντρον, antrum\r\n  φῦκος, fucus\r\n  σπέος      } spelunca\r\n  σπήλαιον   }\r\n  ἴον, viola\r\n  σκόπελος, scopulus\r\n  ὕδωρ, sudor.\r\n\r\n\r\nClass II.--_Elementary objects of animated Nature._\r\n\r\n  θὴρ, fera\r\n  λύκος, lupus\r\n  καπρὸς, aper\r\n  λέων, leo\r\n  ἔγχελυς, anguilla\r\n  ἴχθυς, piscis\r\n  ὠκύπτερος, accipiter\r\n  κύων, κύνος, canis\r\n  ὄϊς, ovis\r\n  βοὺς, bos\r\n  ταῦρος, taurus\r\n  ὓς, sus\r\n  ἵππος, equus\r\n  πῶλος, pullus\r\n  οὖθαρ, uber\r\n  ἄμνος, agnus\r\n  κριὸς, aries\r\n  ἀλώπηξ, vulpes.\r\n\r\n\r\nClass III.--_Articles immediately related to elementary wants and to\r\nlabour._\r\n\r\n1.

They might nearly form the primitive\r\nvocabulary of a rustic and pacific people. Two exceptions may be named,\r\nwhich may deserve remark. It will be observed, that the senses are\r\ninadequately represented, only two of them, smell and taste, being\r\nincluded. The other three are also connected in the two languages as\r\nfollows: touch, by the relation of θιγγάνω and _tango_: sight, by εἴδω\r\nand _video_: hearing, by the evident connection of the Latin _audire_\r\nwith the Greek αὔδη, the proper name in Homer for the voice.\r\n\r\nThe other marked exception is that of religion. With slender\r\nexceptions, such as θεὸς = _deus_, the connection of _rex_ with ῥέζω,\r\nof _numen_ with νεύω, of λοιβὴ with _libo_, and that of ἀράομαι,\r\nἀρητὴρ with _orare_, _orator_, _ara_, there is a considerable want of\r\ncorrespondence in the leading words, such as ἱερὸς, ἅγιος, θύω, βῶμος,\r\nνῆον, ἄγαλμα, σέβω, μάντις, of the one tongue, and _sacer_, _sanctus_,\r\n_pius_, _templum_, _vates_, _macto_, _mola_, of the other. The greater\r\npart of the Pelasgian vocabulary must have been displaced on the one\r\nside or on the other: and as it is in Greece that we have much fuller\r\nand clearer evidence of the advent of a superior race, which gave its\r\nown impress to life and the mind in the higher departments of thought,\r\nwe must conclude that this substitution probably took place in Greece,\r\nand was of Hellenic for Pelasgian words.\r\n\r\nThe proposition of Niebuhr with respect to terms of war, appears to me\r\nto be in the main well sustained by the facts. Let us take for example\r\nthe following list: which appears to show that, in this department,\r\nwith the exception of a pretty close relation between βέλος and\r\n_telum_, and a more remote one between πόλεμος and _bellum_, possibly\r\nalso between _lorica_ and θώρηξ, there is hardly in any case the\r\nfaintest sign of relationship between the customary terms employed in\r\nthe two languages for the respective objects.\r\n\r\n  telum              βέλος\r\n\r\n  ensis     }       {ξίφος\r\n  gladius   }       {φάσγανον\r\n\r\n  cuspis    }\r\n  mucro     }        αἰχμή\r\n  acies     }\r\n\r\n  galea              κυνέη\r\n\r\n  hasta             {δόρυ\r\n                    {ἔγχος\r\n\r\n  scutum[541] }     {ἄσπις\r\n  clypeus     }     {σάκος\r\n\r\n  lorica             θώρηξ\r\n\r\n  ocrea              κνημίς\r\n\r\n  vagina             κολεός\r\n\r\n  bellum            {Ἄρης\r\n                    {πόλεμος\r\n\r\n  prælium   }       {ὑσμίνη\r\n  pugna     }       {μάχη\r\n\r\n  currus    }       {δίφρος\r\n  rheda     }       {ἅρμα\r\n\r\n  rota               κυκλός (Hom.)\r\n\r\n  terno              ῥυμὸς\r\n\r\n  tuba      }        σάλπιγξ\r\n  classicum }\r\n\r\n  castra             κλισίαι\r\n\r\n  tabernaculum[542]  κλισίη\r\n\r\n  arcus             {βιὸς\r\n                    {τόξον\r\n\r\n  sagitta           {ἰὸν\r\n                    {ὀϊστός.\r\n\r\nIt can hardly, I think, be questioned, that this class of words\r\npresents on the whole a very marked contrast to those which were before\r\nexhibited. And as we see the highest martial energies of Greece\r\nmanifestly represented in the Hellenes, we may the more confidently\r\nadopt that inference as to the habits of Hellenes and Pelasgians\r\nrespectively, which the contrast between the two languages of itself\r\nvividly suggests.\r\n\r\nBefore quitting this head of the subject, let us notice the wide\r\ndifference in the channels by which the two languages arrive at the\r\nwords intended to represent the highest excellence. For ‘better’ the\r\nGreeks have βέλτερος, from βέλος, ‘a dart,’ and for ‘best,’ ἄριστος,\r\nfrom ἄρης, ‘war;’ while the Latins are contented with _optimus_, formed\r\nfrom a common root with _opes_, ‘wealth.’\r\n\r\nThere is almost as remarkable a want of correspondence between the two\r\nlanguages in respect to the higher ideas, both intellectual and moral,\r\nas in regard to war.\r\n\r\nIn three words indeed we may trace a clear etymological relationship,\r\nbut in two of the cases with a total, and in the third with an\r\nimportant change in the meaning.\r\n\r\n1. The μένος of the Greeks becomes the Latin _mens_; so that a\r\nparticular quality, and that one belonging to the πάθη rather than the\r\nἤθη of man, comes to stand for the entire mind.\r\n\r\n2. The Greek ἄνεμος is evidently the Latin _animus_: or, that word\r\nwhich remains the symbol of a sensible object in Greek becomes\r\nthe representative of mind in Latin. The adjective ἀνεμώλιος is\r\nindeed capable of a metaphysical application: but it means ‘of no\r\naccount[543].’\r\n\r\n3. The θυμὸς of the Greeks is the _fumus_ of the Latins: and the case\r\nlast described is exactly reversed.\r\n\r\nThe three great words in the early Greek for the unseen or spiritual\r\npowers of man’s nature are νόος, φρὴν, and ψυχή. They perhaps\r\ncorrespond most nearly with the three Latin words _mens_, _indoles_,\r\nand _vita_[544]. There is not the slightest sign of conformity\r\nor common origin in any of the cases; although νόος is akin to\r\n_nosco_[545].\r\n\r\nIn two other very important words we find perhaps derivation from a\r\ncommon root, but nothing like a near or direct relationship. The Greek\r\nἀρετὴ may proceed from the same stock with the Latin _virtus_, and in\r\nlike manner ἄτη may have the same source as _vitium_.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole we may conclude, that in this important class of words\r\nthe resemblances are scanty and remote. It will be seen that under\r\nthe head of general ideas there is not included any clear case of\r\ncorrespondence in a mental quality; and all the resemblances appear to\r\nrest, mediately or immediately, upon sensible objects and phenomena.\r\n\r\nAs respects the terms employed in navigation, it will have been\r\nobserved, that they are all connected with its rudest form, that of\r\nrowing; and that they do not include the words for mast, yard, or sail,\r\nin all of which the two tongues appear to be entirely separated.\r\n\r\nAgain, it may be stated generally, that society in its very earliest\r\nstages has little to do with the use of metals. This rule will be\r\nof various application, according to their abundance or scarcity in\r\nvarious countries, and according to the facility with which they are\r\nconvertible to the uses of man. As the objects of enjoyment multiply\r\nwith the continuance and growth of industry, the precious metals become\r\nmore desirable with a view to exchange. But the principal metal for\r\ndirect utility is iron: and of that, the quantity known and used by the\r\nGreeks would appear, even in the time of Homer, to have been extremely\r\nsmall. The use of metal for works of art, and probably also for\r\ncommercial exchange, would seem to have been derived from Phœnician,\r\nnot Pelasgian sources; and we have no proof that when Homer lived they\r\nhad acquired the art in any high degree for themselves.\r\n\r\nThe absence of any great progress in the use of metals may thus be set\r\ndown as a sign of Pelasgianism. And now let us compare the Greek and\r\nRoman names for the metals respectively:\r\n\r\n  1. χρυσὸς, aurum.\r\n\r\n  2. ἄργυρος, argentum.\r\n\r\n  3. χαλκὸς, æs.\r\n\r\n  4. σίδηρος, ferrum.\r\n\r\n  5. μόλιβος, plumbus: in later Greek μόλυβδος, the form nearest to the\r\n  Latin.\r\n\r\n  6. κασσίτερος, stannum.\r\n\r\nHere also there is a great want of correspondence. Only in iron and\r\nlead, and possibly in silver, are there signs of relationship: but in\r\nall it is remote. In the other metals it is entirely wanting; and in\r\nthose which are nearest, it amounts only to presumptive derivation from\r\na common root. The want of community in this class of terms seems to\r\nshow, that the race which was the common factor of the two nations,\r\nwas probably not advanced in the use of metals beyond their elementary\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nI will only further observe, that while so many names indicative of\r\nsocial and domestic relations are akin, nothing can be more clearly\r\nseparate than the Greek δοῦλος and the Latin _servus_. From this fact\r\nit would be no improbable inference, that slavery was unknown to the\r\nPelasgians: and their ignorance of it would, on the other hand, be\r\nin the closest harmony with their slight concern in warlike and in\r\nmaritime pursuits; since captivity in the one, and kidnapping through\r\nthe other, were the two great feeders of the institution. It is also\r\nin close correspondence with the further hypothesis, which represents\r\nthe Pelasgians as probably the race that first occupied the Greek soil,\r\nand found no predecessors upon it over whom to establish political or\r\nproprietary dominion[546].\r\n\r\nIt may, I think, deserve notice in confirmation of the general\r\nargument, that almost all those Greek words, which are in close\r\naffinity with the Latin, are found in Homer. For there can be little\r\ndoubt that, after his time, the Greek tongue became more and more\r\nHellenic: and the fact that a word is Homeric supplies the most\r\nprobable token of a link with a Pelasgian origin.\r\n\r\nAnd now let us sum up under this head of discussion.\r\n\r\nIt may be said with very general truth, that the words which have\r\nbeen quoted, and the classes to which they belong, have reference to\r\nthe primary experience and to the elementary wants and productions of\r\nlife: but that they do not touch the range of subjects belonging to\r\ncivilization and the highest powers of man, such as war, art, policy,\r\nand song.\r\n\r\nBut if the evidence goes to show, that the Pelasgian tongue supplied\r\nboth the Latin and the Greek nations with most of the principal\r\nelementary words, and with those which express the main ideas connected\r\nwith rural industry, the inference strongly arises, 1. That they\r\nconstituted the base of the Greek nation; and, 2. that, originally\r\ncultivators of the soil for themselves, there came upon them a time\r\nwhen other tribes acquired the mastery among them, so that thenceforth\r\nthey had to cultivate it under the government of others. The case of\r\nthe Pelasgian vocabulary in the Latin and in the Greek languages would\r\nthus appear to resemble the Saxon contribution to the English tongue:\r\nand it is likely that something like the general position, which we\r\nknow to be denoted in the one case, is also similarly to be inferred in\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n_Evidence from names of persons._\r\n\r\nNo inconsiderable light may, I think, be thrown upon the character and\r\npursuits of the Pelasgian and Hellenic races respectively, from an\r\nexamination of the etymology of the names of persons contained in the\r\nHomeric poems. For the names of men, in the early stages of society,\r\nare so frequently drawn direct from their pursuits and habits, that the\r\nideas, on which they are founded, may serve to guide us to a knowledge\r\nof the character and occupations of a people.\r\n\r\nBy way of summary proof that a connection prevailed (whether the names\r\nbe fictitious or not, I care not, for this purpose, to inquire,)\r\nbetween the Homeric names, and the pursuits and habits of those who\r\nbear them, I may refer to the names of Phæacians and Ithacans. Of the\r\nlatter, which are numerous, not one is derived from the horse; and we\r\nknow[547] that no horses were used in Ithaca. The former are chiefly\r\ncomposed of words connected with the sea: in conformity with the fact\r\nthat the pursuits of the people are represented by Homer as thoroughly\r\nmaritime.\r\n\r\nThe names of persons in Homer are extremely numerous, amounting to many\r\nhundreds. It would be hazardous, as a general rule, to assume for them\r\nan historical character, except in the cases of such individuals as,\r\nfrom general eminence or local connection, or from some particular\r\ngift or circumstance, were likely to be held in remembrance. In some\r\ncases, as we have already seen[548], they bear the marks of invention\r\nupon them. But this question is little material for the present\r\npurpose: and indeed the probability that we ought, as a general rule,\r\nto regard the less distinguished names as fabricated for the purposes\r\nof the poem, makes it the more reasonable that we should turn to them\r\nto see how far they connect themselves with distinctions of pursuit,\r\ncharacter, and race, and what properties and characteristics, when so\r\nconnected, they appear to indicate as having been assigned by Homer to\r\none race or to another.\r\n\r\nWe must not expect to arrive at anything better than general and\r\napproximate conclusions; for particular circumstances, unknown to us,\r\nmay have varied the course of etymological nomenclature, and it may\r\nalso happen, that in a great number of cases we cannot securely trace\r\netymology at all.\r\n\r\nSubject to these cautions, I would observe, first, that the evidence\r\nfrom other sources generally tends to show,\r\n\r\n1. That the Trojans, except as to the royal house[549], and perhaps a\r\nfew other distinguished families, were Pelasgian.\r\n\r\n2. That the base of the Greek army and nation were Pelasgian: with\r\nan infusion of Hellenic tribes, not families merely, who held the\r\ngoverning power and probably formed the upper, that is, the proprietary\r\nand military, class of the community, in most parts of Greece.\r\n\r\n3. That some parts of the Greek peninsula present little or no mark of\r\nHellenic influences; particularly Attica and Arcadia.\r\n\r\n4. That the Lycians appear to approximate more than the other races\r\non the Trojan side to the high Greek type, and to present either the\r\nHellenic element, or some element akin to it, in a marked form.\r\n\r\nThe investigation of individual names occurring singly would be\r\nendless, and often equivocal: but Homer frequently unites many names\r\nin a group under circumstances, which authorize us to assume a common\r\norigin and character for the persons designated: and others, though he\r\nmay not collect them together in the same passage, are yet associated\r\nin virtue of palpable relations between them.\r\n\r\nAn examination of Homeric names, in the groups thus gathered, has\r\nbrought me to the following results:\r\n\r\n1. Where we have reason to presume an Hellenic extraction, a large\r\nproportion of those names, of which the etymology can be traced,\r\nappear to express ideas connected with glory, political power, mental\r\nfortitude, energy and ability, martial courage and strength, or\r\nmilitary operations.\r\n\r\n2. But where we may more reasonably suppose, in part or in whole, a\r\nPelasgic stock, ideas of this kind are more rarely expressed, and\r\nanother vein of etymology appears, founded on rural habits, abodes,\r\nand pursuits, or the creation and care of worldly goods, or on other\r\nproperties or occupations less akin to political and martial pursuits,\r\nor to high birth and station.\r\n\r\nIt is at the same time worth remark that, among the slaves of the\r\nOdyssey, we find names of a more high-born cast than those most\r\ncurrent among the Pelasgians. Such as Eumæus (μάω, to desire eagerly\r\nand strive after), Euryclea, (who moreover is daughter of Ops the son\r\nof Peisenor,) Eurymedusa (in Scheria), and Alcippe (at Sparta[550]).\r\nThere were two causes, to which this might be referable: first, that\r\nhigh-born slaves were often obtained both by kidnapping and by war;\r\nEumæus, as we know, was of this class. And secondly, that the names\r\nof their lords may then, as now, have been occasionally given them.\r\nSo that the high significations connected with servile names do not\r\nconstitute an objection to the rules which have been stated.\r\n\r\nThere is another class of names, which requires especial notice. They\r\nare those which have reference to the horse. The rearing and care of\r\nthe horse are in Homer more connected with the Trojans, than with the\r\nGreeks: and his standing epithet, ἱπποδάμος, is more largely employed\r\non the Trojan side[551]. The horse was not exclusively, perhaps not\r\nprincipally, employed in war and games. He was used in travelling also:\r\nhe may have been employed as a beast of burden: he certainly drew the\r\nplough, though Homer informs us that in this occupation the mule was\r\npreferable.\r\n\r\nThe points at which we may expect to find names chiefly Pelasgian,\r\nbesides those which are expressly given us as such, will be these three:\r\n\r\n1. In connection with some particular parts of Greece, especially\r\nAttica or Arcadia.\r\n\r\n2. Among the masses of the common Greek soldiery.\r\n\r\n3. Still more unequivocally among the masses of the Trojan force, and\r\nof the auxiliaries generally; except the Lycians, whom we have seen\r\nreason to presume to have been less Pelasgian, and more allied, or at\r\nleast more similar, to the Hellic races.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand we may presume Hellic blood, or what in Homer’s\r\nestimation was akin to it, among the Lycians, and likewise wherever\r\nwe find, especially on the Greek side, any considerable collection of\r\nnames appertaining to the higher class or aristocracy of the army, or\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\n_Names of the Pelasgian Class._\r\n\r\nThe Homeric names, which are given us as expressly Pelasgian, are four\r\nonly; and they belong to the Pelasgian force on the Trojan side.\r\n\r\n  1. Hippothous.\r\n  2. Pulæus.\r\n  3. Lethus.\r\n  4. Teutamus[552].\r\n\r\nThe etymology of the three first names seems obvious enough: and,\r\nthough the persons are all rulers among their people, not one of them\r\nunequivocally presents the characteristics which we should regard as\r\nappropriate in Hellic names: although, from their being of the highest\r\nrank, we should be less surprised if the case were otherwise.\r\n\r\nAs regards the first of the four, upon examining the class of names\r\nrelating to the horse in the poems, we find, as far as I have observed,\r\nonly Hipponous[553] among the Greeks. This rank does not clearly\r\nappear: but νόος, the second factor of the word, supplies the higher\r\nelement.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, in addition to Hippolochus, a name meaning\r\nhorse-ambush, who was both Lycian and royal, we have Hippasus,\r\nHippodamas, Hippodamus, Hippocoon, Hippomachus, and Hippotion. We have\r\nlikewise,\r\n\r\n  Melanippus, (Il. xvi. 695.)\r\n  Echepolus, (Il. xvi. 417.)\r\n  Euippus, (Il. xvi. 417.)\r\n\r\nTake again Pulæus, from πύλη. This name may mean porter or gate-keeper:\r\nit is scarcely susceptible of a high sense. In connection with the\r\ncharacter of the Pelasgians as masons and builders of walled places, it\r\nis appropriate to them. Homer has three other names, and no more, which\r\nappear to be founded simply upon the term gate: Πύλων, Πυλάρτης, and\r\nΠυλαιμένης. They are all on the Trojan side.\r\n\r\nNext, we have a larger class of names, where a strong infusion of the\r\nPelasgic character may be expected: namely, those connected with Attica.\r\n\r\nAmong these, three belong to its royal house, and in them we find no\r\ncertain features of the Pelasgian kind. They are,\r\n\r\n  1. Erechtheus,   }\r\n  2. Peteos,       } From Il. ii. 547-52.\r\n  3. Menestheus,   }\r\n\r\nThe last of the three, however, seems, if derived from μένος, to belong\r\nto the higher class of names.\r\n\r\nBesides these three there are,\r\n\r\n  4. Pheidas,   }\r\n  5. Stichius,  } Il. xiii. 690, 1.\r\n  6. Bias,      }\r\n\r\n  7. Iasus,     }\r\n  8. Sphelus,   } Il. xv. 332, 7, 8.\r\n  9. Boucolus.  }\r\n\r\nNow the whole of these are commanders or officers; and yet four of\r\nthem, Pheidas (φείδω), Stichius (στείχω), Sphelus (σφάλλω), and\r\nBoucolus (βούκολος), are in a marked manner of the Pelasgian class:\r\nBias (βίη), may perhaps belong to it, as meaning mere physical force:\r\nand on the etymology of the ancient name Iasus I do not venture to\r\nspeculate. Boucolus, like Boucolion, which we shall meet presently,\r\ndeserves particular attention: we find nothing at all resembling it\r\namong the names which are (on other grounds) presumably Hellic.\r\n\r\nOther names in the poems, which there may be some reason, from their\r\nlocal connection, to presume Pelasgian, are,\r\n\r\n  1. Lycoorgus,   } From Il. vii. 136, 149, where\r\n  2. Ereuthalion, } they are described as Arcadians.\r\n  3. Dmetor, Lord of Cyprus, from Od. xvii. 443.\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps we may add,\r\n\r\n  4. An Ion or Ian, as head of the Ἰάονες.\r\n  5. An Apis, the early eponymist of the Peloponnesus, or a part of\r\n     it[554].\r\n\r\nNow, though these are all rulers and great personages, the name Dmetor\r\nis the only one among them which seems in any degree to present\r\nHellenic ideas: nor need that mean a subduer of men; it may as well\r\nmean simply a breaker of horses. Apis, we have every reason to suppose,\r\nmeans the ox. Lycoorgus, from Λυκὸς and ἔργον or its root, has all the\r\nappearance of being characteristically Pelasgian.\r\n\r\nLet us now inquire if the rules laid down will bear the test of being\r\napplied to the lower order of the Greek soldiery.\r\n\r\nIn the Fifth Iliad Hector and Mars slay a batch of apparently\r\nundistinguished persons[555]. They are,\r\n\r\n  1. Teuthras.\r\n  2. Orestes.\r\n  3. Trechus.\r\n  4. Œnomaus.\r\n  5. Helenus (son of Œnops).\r\n  6. Orestius.\r\n\r\nAnd again in the Eleventh Iliad Hector slays nine more;\r\n\r\n  1. Asæus.\r\n  2. Autonous.\r\n  3. Opites.\r\n  4. Dolops (son of Clytus).\r\n  5. Opheltius.\r\n  6. Agelaus.\r\n  7. Æsymnus.\r\n  8. Orus.\r\n  9. Hipponous.\r\n\r\nNow out of the seventeen names here assembled,\r\n\r\nFour, namely, Autonous, Clytus, Agelaus, and Æsymnus (from its\r\nconnection with the word αἰσυμνητὴς, ruler), belong to what I term the\r\nHellic class.\r\n\r\nThree, namely, Teuthras, Asæus, and Helenus, do not immediately suggest\r\na particular derivation.\r\n\r\nOf Hipponous I have already spoken. The other nine appear to conform to\r\nthe Pelasgian type. Œnomaus corresponds with the Latin Bibulus.\r\n\r\nAgain; the names of ordinary Trojans appear to belong generally to the\r\nsame type.\r\n\r\nWhen Patroclus commences his exploits in the Sixteenth book, he slays\r\nin succession,\r\n\r\n  1. Pronous.\r\n  2. Thestor, son of\r\n  3. Enops.\r\n  4. Erualus.\r\n  5. Erumas.\r\n  6. Amphoteros.\r\n  7. Epaltes.\r\n  8. Tlepolemus, son of\r\n  9. Damastor.\r\n  10. Echios.\r\n  11. Puris.\r\n  12. Ipheus.\r\n  13. Euippus, and\r\n  14. Polumelus, son of\r\n  15. Argeas.\r\n\r\nOf these only Tlepolemus and Pronous can with certainty be assigned\r\nto the higher class. Damastor is doubtful, like Dmetor; but perhaps\r\nfrom its connection with Tlepolemus, we ought to place it in the same\r\ncategory. Still it must be observed that Homer takes care to bring into\r\naction against Patroclus and the Myrmidons his favourites the Lycians,\r\nas well as the Trojans[556]: and that therefore we are to presume in\r\nthis list an intermixture of Lycian names.\r\n\r\nThe names of ordinary Trojans are for the most part of the same colour.\r\nBut we must bear in mind that we cannot so easily trace the Trojan as\r\nthe Greek commonalty. Homer rarely allows a Greek of high station or\r\ndistinction to be slain: whereas the Greeks continually destroy Trojans\r\nof eminence. We may therefore be prepared to find names of the higher\r\ntype somewhat more freely sprinkled among the Trojan than among the\r\nGreek slain.\r\n\r\nIn the Sixth Iliad[557] a number of the Greek heroes dispatch\r\nconsecutively a list of Trojans, which supplies the following names:\r\n\r\n  1. Dresus.\r\n  2. Opheltius.\r\n                 { These two were sons of Boucolion,\r\n                 { an illegitimate son of Laomedon,\r\n  3. Æsepus      { who apparently never was acknowledged,\r\n                 { but was brought up in the\r\n  4. Pedasus     { lower class by his mother Abarbaree.\r\n                 { I add these names to the list:\r\n  5. Boucolion.\r\n  6. Abarbaree (mother of Boucolion).\r\n  7. Astualus.\r\n  8. Pidutes.\r\n  9. Aretaon.\r\n  10. Ableros.\r\n  11. Elatus.\r\n  12. Phylacus.\r\n  13. Melanthius.\r\n  14. Adrestus.\r\n\r\nAmong all these names there is not one which we can with confidence\r\nplace in the higher category except Aretaon. Dresus (compare δρήστηρ,\r\na domestic servant), Opheltius, Boucolion, Melanthius (from its use in\r\nthe Odyssey, supported by Melantho, and both belonging to servants),\r\nare unequivocally of the Pelasgian class: probably Elatus (which\r\nhowever is found among the Ithacan suitors), Phylacus, Adrestus, should\r\nbe similarly interpreted. Astualos (ἄστυ, ἃλς) has no contrary force:\r\nand of the rest the derivation is not obvious.\r\n\r\nIf we take the second batch of Trojans slain by Patroclus, it gives a\r\nsomewhat different result. They are[558],\r\n\r\n  1. Adrestus.\r\n  2. Autonous.\r\n  3. Echeclus.\r\n  4. Perimus, son of Megas.\r\n  5. Epistor.\r\n  6. Melanippus.\r\n  7. Elasus.\r\n  8. Moulius.\r\n  9. Pulartes.\r\n\r\nOf these Autonous and Epistor would seem clearly to belong to the\r\nhigher class; to which we may add Echeclus, if it is derived (like\r\nEchecles, a Myrmidon chieftain) from ἔχω and κλέος: but even this is\r\nnot a large proportion.\r\n\r\nNow when we turn to the Lycians[559] slain consecutively by Ulysses, we\r\nfind a material change. These are,\r\n\r\n  1. Koiranos.\r\n  2. Alastor.\r\n  3. Chromius.\r\n  4. Alcandros.\r\n  5. Halios.\r\n  6. Noemon.\r\n  7. Prutanis.\r\n\r\n_Of the higher or Hellenic Class._\r\n\r\nAll of these seven visibly belong to the higher or Hellenic order of\r\nnames, except Χρόμιος, which I presume may be akin to χρῶμα, and Ἅλιος,\r\n‘mariner.’ But this last named designation is also somewhat Hellic: I\r\ndoubt if we find among Pelasgian names any taken from maritime ideas or\r\npursuits.\r\n\r\nAgain, when Achilles comes forth, there is provided for him a list of\r\nvictims bearing distinguished names[560], though practically unknown as\r\ncharacters in the poem. At the end of the Twentieth book he slays,\r\n\r\n  1. Druops.\r\n  2. Demouchus, son of\r\n  3. Philetor.\r\n  4. Laogonus, and\r\n  5. Dardanus, sons of\r\n  6. Bias.\r\n  7. Tros, son of\r\n  8. Alastor.\r\n  9. Moulius.\r\n  10. Echeclus, son of\r\n  11. Agenor.\r\n  12. Deucalion.\r\n  13. Rigmos, son of\r\n  14. Peiroos, one of the Thracian leaders.\r\n  15. Areithous.\r\n\r\nNow of these fifteen names none, if judged by the rules which we have\r\nlaid down, would clearly fall into the Pelasgian, or more plebeian,\r\nclass, except Dryops, perhaps Laogonus, and Bias: three only. Peiroos\r\nand Rigmos (probably akin to ῥῖγος) are Thracian, and may be put aside.\r\nSix, viz., Demuchus, Philetor, Alastor (contrast with this Lethus),\r\nEcheclus, Agenor, and Areithous, are of the Hellic class. The others,\r\nDardanus, Tros, Moulius (Il. xi. 739), and Deucalion are repeated from\r\neminent historical personages.\r\n\r\nIn this set of names we observe, in conjunction with a new instance\r\nof Homer’s ever wakeful care in doing supreme honour to Achilles,\r\nunequivocal evidence, as I think, that the poet did distribute his\r\nnames with some special meaning among his minor, and, (so we must\r\nsuppose,) generally or frequently, non-historical personages.\r\n\r\nAnd the further inference may perhaps be drawn of a probable affinity\r\nof race between the highest Trojans and the Hellic tribes.\r\n\r\nThis inference may be supported by another example. The numerous sons\r\nof Antenor, whose names are collected from different parts of the poem,\r\nare as follows:\r\n\r\n  1. Agenor, Il. xi. 59.\r\n  2. Acamas, ii. 823. xi. 60. xii. 100, _et alibi_.\r\n  3. Archelochus, ii. 823. xiv. 464.\r\n  4. Coon, xi. 248.\r\n  5. Demoleon, xx. 395.\r\n  6. Echeclus, xx. 474.\r\n  7. Helicaon, iii. 123.\r\n  8. Iphidamas, xi. 221.\r\n  9. Laodamas, xv. 516.\r\n  10. Laodocus, iv. 87. and\r\n  11. Pedæus (νόθος), v. 70.\r\n\r\nI apprehend Laodocus should be construed, after the manner of\r\nDemodocus, to signify having fame or repute among the λαός. If so, then\r\nof the ten legitimate sons, eight have names with an etymology that\r\ndirectly connects them with the higher signification. The name of the\r\nBastard only is more doubtful.\r\n\r\nAmong the Suitors in Ithaca, who are the princes and chief men of the\r\nisland, with their connections, and others of the same class, we have\r\nthe following list of names of the high class:\r\n\r\n  Mentor.\r\n  Elatus. (cf. Il. xi. 701.)\r\n  Euryades.\r\n  Eurydamas.\r\n  Eurymachus.\r\n  Eurynomus.\r\n  Amphinomus.\r\n  Peisander.\r\n  Eupeithes.\r\n  Antinous.\r\n  Leiocritus.\r\n  Leiodes.\r\n  Agelaus.\r\n  Damastor.\r\n  Demoptolemus.\r\n  Euryades.\r\n  Mastor.\r\n  Euenor.\r\n  Phronius.\r\n  Noemon.\r\n\r\nNor are the names which have not been placed in this list of an\r\nopposite character. They are chiefly such as have not an obvious\r\netymology. Two of them, Ægyptius and Polybus, were, as we know, great\r\nnames in Egypt, and they probably indicate a Pelasgian or an Egyptian\r\nextraction. Others are, Halitherses, Melaneus, Ctesippus, Nisus,\r\nAntiphus, Peiræus. Of these, the two, or even the three, first may\r\nperhaps be regarded as properly Hellic.\r\n\r\nTake again the six sons of Nestor:\r\n\r\n  1. Antilochus.\r\n  2. Stratius.\r\n  3. Thrasymedes.\r\n  4. Echephron.\r\n  5. Perseus.\r\n  6. Aretus (akin to ἀρέσκω, ἀρετή, and the Arete of Scheria).\r\n\r\nOf these only Perseus would not at once fall within the class; and this\r\nis evidently a most noble name, taken from a great Greek hero. Indeed\r\nit must itself stand as a conspicuous example of the rule, if we shall\r\nhereafter be able to show[561] a relationship between the Hellic races\r\nand Persia as their fountain-head.\r\n\r\nLastly, let us take the Myrmidon leaders and commanders. These were,\r\n\r\n  1. Patroclus; { and after him the heads of the five\r\n       son of   { divisions.\r\n  2. Menœtius.\r\n  3. Menesthius.\r\n  4. Eudorus.\r\n  5. Peisander, son of\r\n  6. Maimalus, from μαιμάω.\r\n  7. Phœnix. This name may represent, (1) Phœnician\r\n  extraction or connection; (2) The palm\r\n  tree; (3) The colour of red or purple, akin to\r\n  φόνος, and to blood, which the colour φοίνιξ is\r\n  supposed to betoken. In any of these three\r\n  aspects, it will fall into the Hellic class.\r\n  8. Alcimedon, son of Laerces.\r\n  9. Automedon.\r\n\r\nAll these names belong to the higher categories. It is therefore the\r\ngeneral result of our inquiry, that wherever we have reason on other\r\ngrounds to presume a Pelasgian origin, we find in the proper names of\r\npersons, unless they chance to be merely descriptive of the country\r\nthey inhabited, a decided tendency to represent peaceful, profitable,\r\nand laborious pursuits, or the lower qualities and conditions of\r\nmankind. But wherever from other causes we are entitled to presume an\r\nHellic relationship, there, so far as a simple etymology will carry\r\nus, the personal appellatives appear to run upon ideas derived from\r\nintellect, power, command, policy, fame, the great qualities and\r\nachievements of war; in short, apart from religion, which does not\r\nappear to enter into the composition of nomenclature at all, all the\r\nideas that appeal most strongly to those masculine faculties of our\r\nrace, in which its perfection was so vividly conceived by the Greeks to\r\nreside.\r\n\r\n_Evidence from political and martial ideas._\r\n\r\nOne among the most remarkable features of the Homeric Poems is, their\r\nhighly forward development of political ideas in a very early stage\r\nof society[562]. It seems hardly necessary to argue that these were\r\nof Hellic origin; because the fact is before us, that they make their\r\nappearance in Homer simultaneously with the universal ascendancy of the\r\nHellic over the Pelasgian tribes wherever they were in contact; and\r\nbecause, in comparing the two nations together, we shall have occasion\r\nto note the greater backwardness, and indocility, so to speak, of the\r\nTrojans[563] in this respect. I assume, therefore, without detailed\r\nargument, the peculiar relation between the Hellic stock and the\r\npolitical institutions of Greece.\r\n\r\nFor similar reasons I shall touch very briefly the relation of the\r\nHellic tribes to the martial character of Greece.\r\n\r\nWe may consider the whole Iliad, which represents a conflict between\r\nless Pelasgic and more Pelasgic races, and which gives a clear\r\nsuperiority to the former, as a general but decisive testimony to this\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nWe find another such testimony, with a well established historical\r\ncharacter, in the comparison between the secondary military position\r\nof Athens in the Iliad, and its splendid distinctions in later\r\ntimes. It is true indeed, that the Athenian troops are mentioned\r\nspecifically in the attack upon the ships, together with the Bœotians,\r\nLocrians, Phthians, and Epeans[564]. Of these the two latter are\r\ncalled respectively μεγάθυμοι and φαιδιμόεντες; the Athenians are the\r\nἸάονες ἑλκεχίτωνες, an epithet of most doubtful character as applied\r\nto soldiers. It seems to me plain that Homer by no means meant the\r\nparticular notice of these five divisions for a mark of honour: they\r\nfought to be defeated, and he does not use his prime Greeks in that\r\nmanner. No Peloponnesian forces are named as having been engaged on\r\nthis occasion. Those probably were the flower of the army; and it\r\nis mentioned in the Catalogue that the troops of Agamemnon were the\r\nbest[565]. Again, it will be seen, on reference to the Catalogue,\r\nthat the whole force of Middle Greece is here in battle except the\r\nÆtolians, the contingent of Ulysses, and the Abantes (for whom see\r\n542-4). These three are all distinguished races, whom he seems\r\npurposely to have excluded from a contest, where honour was not to be\r\ngained. The military contrast, then, between the earlier and the later\r\nAthens, may be taken to be established: and with it coincides that\r\nvery marked, though normal and pacific, transition of Attica from the\r\nexclusively Pelasgic to the fullest development of the composite Greek\r\ncharacter[566].\r\n\r\nThe passage of the seventh Iliad, which describes the war of the\r\nPylians with the Arcadians, suggests a like conclusion.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, however, the _de facto_ Hellic ascendancy in Greece at\r\nthe time is, with reference to war and the strong hand even more than\r\nto policy, a full presumption of their title to be regarded as having\r\ngiven birth to the splendid military genius of Greece.\r\n\r\nWhen, for the business of the Trojan war, Homer divides the two great\r\ntraditive deities[567], and assigns to the Greeks Pallas, the more\r\npolitical, energetic, and intellectual of the two, to the Trojans\r\nApollo, we may take this as of itself involving an assertion, that the\r\nhigh arts of policy and war were peculiarly Hellenic.\r\n\r\n_Evidence from Games._\r\n\r\nWe come now to the principle of what may be called corporal education,\r\nwhich found a development among the Greeks more fully than among any\r\nother nation; first, in gymnastic exercises, generally pursued, and,\r\nsecondly, in the great national institution of the Games.\r\n\r\n“There were,” says Grote[568], “two great holding points in common for\r\nevery section of Greeks. One was the Amphictyonic Assembly, which met\r\nhalf yearly, alternately at Delphi and at Thermopylae; originally and\r\nchiefly for common religious purposes, but indirectly and occasionally\r\nembracing political and social objects along with them. The other\r\nwas, the public festivals or games, of which the Olympic came first\r\nin importance; next, the Pythian, Nemean, and Isthmian: institutions,\r\nwhich combined religious solemnities with recreative effusion and\r\nhearty sympathies, in a manner so imposing and so unparalleled.\r\nAmphictyon represents the first of these institutions, and Aethlius the\r\nsecond.”\r\n\r\nThis passage places in an extremely clear light the relative position\r\nof the Games and the Amphictyonic Assembly. The Council represented\r\na religious institution, partaking also of a political character. The\r\nGames, on the other hand, were a gymnastic celebration, made available\r\nfor national gatherings: placed, as a matter of prime public moment,\r\nunder the guardianship of high religious solemnities, and referred for\r\ngreater effect, in the later tradition, to some person of the highest\r\nrank and extraction, as their nominal founder. As the objects of the\r\nGames and the Council were distinct, so were their origin and history\r\ndifferent; and this difference mounted up into the very earliest\r\nages. This is clearly proved by the extra-historic and mythical names\r\nassigned to their founders, whose faint personality does not even\r\nserve to repress the suggestion of fiction, conveyed with irresistible\r\nforce by etymological considerations. But the legend, though a legend\r\nonly, conformed to the laws of probability, by assigning to Amphictyon\r\na Thessalian birth, and by vindicating at the same time to Aethlius\r\nthe higher honour of the immediate paternity of Jupiter; while, by\r\nplacing him in Elis it secures his function as the institutor of the\r\noldest, namely, the Olympic Games. In this legend, too, we see Hellenic\r\nimagination providing for its own ancestral honours in competition,\r\nas it were, with those of the sister institution, which may have been\r\nPelasgian.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of Games _in genere_ appears to be traceable, with\r\nsufficient clearness and upon Homeric evidence, to the Hellic tribes.\r\n\r\nThe lengthened detail of the Twenty-third Iliad is of itself enough\r\nto prove their importance, as an institution founded in the national\r\nhabits and manners. We must not, however, rely upon the absence of any\r\nsimilar celebrations, or even allusions to them, among the Trojans;\r\nsince their condition, in the circumstances of the war, will of itself\r\naccount for it. But we may observe how closely it belonged to the\r\ncharacter of the greatest heroes to excel in every feat of gymnastic\r\nstrength, as well as in the exercises of actual warfare. The kings\r\nand leading chiefs all act in the Games, with the qualified exception\r\nof Agamemnon, whose dignity could not allow him to be actually judged\r\nby his inferiors, but yet who appears as a nominal candidate, and\r\nreceives the compliment of a prize, though spared the contest for it;\r\nand with the exception also of Achilles, who could not contend for his\r\nown prizes. Again, it is a piece of evidence in favour of the Hellic\r\ncharacter of public Games, that, though there were three Athenian\r\nleaders alive during the action of the Twenty-third Book, none of them\r\ntook any part. They were Menestheus, Pheidas, and Bias. Again, the\r\nspeech of Ulysses to Euryalus, the saucy Phæacian[569], with the acts\r\nwhich followed it, strengthen the general testimony of the Iliad upon\r\nthe point. So does the prosecution of these exercises, to the best of\r\ntheir power, even by the Phæacians, the kindred of the gods.\r\n\r\nSo much for the general idea of Games in Homer; but, to draw the\r\ndistinction with any force between what is Hellic and what is Pelasgic,\r\nwe must refer to those passages which afford glimpses of the earlier\r\nstate of Greece, and see what light they afford us.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Homeric text, Elis and Corinth were the portions of\r\nthe Peloponnesus, where the early notes of the presence of the Hellenic\r\nraces are most evident. Now of these Elis had the greatest and oldest\r\nGreek Games, while the Isthmian festival at Corinth was held to stand\r\nnext to them.\r\n\r\nThe invention of these gymnastic exercises was ascribed in the later\r\nmythology to Mercury, who is in Homer a Hellenic, as opposed to\r\nPelasgian, deity.\r\n\r\n    Mercurî, facunde nepos Atlantis,\r\n    Qui feros mores hominum recentum\r\n    Voce formasti catus, et decoræ\r\n          More palæstræ[570].\r\n\r\nIt has been observed, that the Hermes of Homer bears no trace of this\r\nfunction: but we have no proof in Homer of the formal institution of\r\nGames at all, although we have clear signs of them as a known and\r\nfamiliar practice; and the Mercury of the poems is even yet more\r\nPhœnician than he is Hellenic. Aristophanes[571] produces the Ἑρμῆς\r\nἘναγώνιος, and supplies a fresh link of connection by referring to\r\nἀγῶνες in music, as well as in feats of corporal strength and skill. So\r\ndoes Pindar[572].\r\n\r\nIn truth, these Games were the exercise and pleasure of the highest\r\norders only. For we see that, in Homer’s Twenty-third Book, not a\r\nsingle person takes a part in any of the eight matches that is not\r\nactually named among the ἡγεμόνες and κοίρανοι of the Catalogue, with\r\nthree such exceptions as really confirm the rule. They are Antilochus,\r\nthe heir apparent of Pylos, Teucer the brother of Ajax, and Epeus,\r\n(only however in the boxing match,) who appears from the Odyssey[573]\r\nto have been a person of importance, as he contrived the stratagem of\r\nthe horse. Even the σόλος αὐτοχόωνος, the iron lump, part of the booty\r\nof Achilles, had formerly been used for the sport only of a king[574].\r\n\r\n    ὃν πρὶν μὲν ῥίπτασκε μέγα σθένος Ἠετίωνος.\r\n\r\nThe Greek Games presuppose leisure, and therefore the accumulation of\r\nproperty, or the concentrated possession of lands: but this comports\r\nmuch more with Hellenic than with what we know of Pelasgic society, in\r\nwhich we do not find the same signs as in the former, of an aristocracy\r\noccupying the middle place between the people at large, and the royal\r\nhouse. Let us now examine another part of the Homeric evidence.\r\n\r\nIn the Eleventh Iliad, Nestor’s legend acquaints us that, at the time\r\nof the war between Pylians and Elians, Neleus the king appropriated a\r\npart of the Pylian spoil, in respect of a ‘debt’ owed him in Elis, the\r\nnature of which he explains[575]:\r\n\r\n    τέσσαρες ἀθλοφόροι ἵπποι αὐτοῖσιν ὄχεσφιν,\r\n    ἐλθόντες μετ’ ἄεθλα· περὶ τρίποδος γὰρ ἔμελλον\r\n    θεύσεσθαι· τοὺς δ’ αὖθι ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν Αὐγείας\r\n    κάσχεθε, τὸν δ’ ἐλατῆρ’ ἀφίει, ἀκαχήμενον ἵππων.\r\n\r\nThere were then, it is plain, chariot races regularly established\r\n(for the Games are here spoken of without explanation, as a matter\r\nfamiliarly known) in Olympia: and this was during the boyhood of\r\nNestor, or about two generations before the Trojan war. The tribes,\r\nwhich we here see concerned in these Games, are first, the Pylians,\r\nand next the Elians, of whom Augeas was king. It will be seen in a\r\nsubsequent part of this inquiry[576], that both of these tribes were\r\nHellic, and not Pelasgian. Yet certainly there is nothing here to show\r\ndirectly the non-participation of Pelasgians in the games.\r\n\r\nThere is however another passage of our useful friend Nestor in the\r\nTwenty-third Book, which supplies in some degree even this form of\r\nevidence. ‘Would,’ says he in his usual phrase, ‘would I were young and\r\nstrong[577],’\r\n\r\n    ὡς ὅποτε κρείοντ’ Ἀμαρυγκέα θάπτον Ἐπειοὶ\r\n    Βουπρασίῳ, παῖδες δ’ ἔθεσαν βασιλῆος ἄεθλα·\r\n\r\nHere is a distinct testimony to the custom of funeral Games in Elis,\r\nnearly two generations before the _Troica_. They embraced, as we find\r\nfurther down in the record, 1. Chariot races, with the best prize; 2.\r\nBoxing; 3. Wrestling; 4. Running; and 5. Hurling the spear. But we have\r\na further most valuable passage. There was no person present, says\r\nNestor, equal to myself; and then he adds an exhaustive enumeration of\r\nthe races that furnished the company:\r\n\r\n            οὔτ’ ἄρ’ Ἐπεῶν,\r\n    οὔτ’ αὐτῶν Πυλίων, οὔτ’ Αἰτώλων μεγαθύμων.\r\n\r\nFor the Epeans (or Elians) and Pylians, I repeat the reference already\r\nmade. Nor can I doubt that the Ætolians, the subjects of Œneus and\r\nhis illustrious family, belonged to the same stock. I do not inquire\r\nwhether, as they were always in later times held to belong to the\r\nÆolian branch of the Greeks, so their name may have been radically akin\r\nto, or identical with, the name of Æolus, which is often with Homer\r\nΑἴωλος. But we find Meleager (independently of the reference to him,\r\nevidently as a great national hero, in the Catalogue[578],) selected\r\nby Phœnix for the subject of an episode of great length, and held out\r\nas a warning and example to Achilles[579]. It may safely be assumed\r\nhe would have chosen no character for this purpose, except that of an\r\nhero of pure Hellic origin. And the description of Tydeus, the father\r\nof Diomed, by the epithet Αἰτώλιος[580], again serves to identify the\r\nÆtolian name with the Hellic races.\r\n\r\nThe tribes present, then, at the Games were all Hellic, and they were\r\nall conterminous: the Epean inhabitants, the Pylians, neighbours on the\r\nSouth, the Ætolians from the other side of the narrow strait, which\r\nwas the most frequented passage into Peloponnesus. In fact, it was\r\nevidently an assemblage of the neighbouring tribes; but with a most\r\nremarkable exception, that of the eastern neighbours of Elis, those\r\nsame Arcadians, whom by many signs we are enabled to conclude to have\r\nbeen Pelasgian.\r\n\r\nA third instance in which Homer notices gymnastic exercises, is in\r\nIl. iv. 389. Here Tydeus, having gone to Thebes, finds a solemn\r\nbanquet proceeding in the palace of Eteocles. Alone among many, and on\r\nquestionable terms with his hosts, he nevertheless at once challenges\r\nthem to gymnastic games, and beats them all.\r\n\r\n    ἀλλ’ ὅγ’ ἀεθλεύειν προκαλίζετο, πάντα δ’ ἐνίκα\r\n    ῥηιδίως· τοίη οἱ ἐπιρρόθος ἦεν Ἀθήνη.\r\n\r\nAchæan, that is Hellene, himself, he is, if not among Hellenes, yet\r\namong the members and adherents of that Phœnician dynasty which had\r\nestablished itself, to all appearance, in Bœotia, at a somewhat early\r\ndate: even as, at a period slightly later[581], Minos established from\r\nPhœnicia a Throne in Crete, which soon became wholly Greek in character.\r\n\r\nAnd again, in Il. xxiii. 678-80, we are told, that Mecisteus, on the\r\ndeath of Œdipus, went to Thebes to the even then customary funeral\r\nGames, and there was victor over all the Καδμείωνες who opposed him, by\r\nthe aid of Minerva. Euryalus, the son of Mecisteus, was an Argive, and\r\nwas the colleague of Diomed and Sthenelus. The same observations are\r\napplicable here, as in the last case.\r\n\r\nThere is therefore nothing in any one of these cases to connect the\r\ngymnastic celebrations with the Pelasgian, but every thing to associate\r\nthem with the Hellic races.\r\n\r\nOf the Greek Games, the Pythian are those which, as being under\r\nApollo, might most be suspected of Pelasgic origin. But these did\r\nnot apparently begin as a national gymnastic festival until about 586\r\nB. C.[582] The Olympic contests had then been regularly recorded for\r\nnearly two hundred years, since 776 B. C. And in the laws of Solon\r\nthere was a reward of 500 drachms for every Athenian who should gain\r\nan Olympic prize, of 100 only for an Isthmian: while of the Nemean and\r\nPythian Games, as being merely local, they take no notice. So these\r\nGames, besides being secondary, belonged to times much later, and also\r\npurely Hellenic.\r\n\r\nThe Panathenaic Games are apparently of similar date. And with this\r\nevidence from the earlier historic times before us, no importance can\r\nattach to a tradition so late as that of Pausanias, who makes Theseus\r\nfound the Panathenaica, and Lycaon, son of Pelasgus, the Λύκαια[583].\r\nBut it is well worthy of remark, that in reporting this tradition he\r\nadds, that the Olympic Games were much older, that they mounted to\r\nthe very highest antiquity of the human race, and that Κρόνος and\r\nJupiter were said to have contended at them for prizes. Again, great\r\nfame attached to the Games said to have been celebrated by Acastus on\r\nthe death of his father Pelias. Stesichorus, who lived in the seventh\r\ncentury, wrote a poem upon them; but Pelias, the brother of Neleus, and\r\nson of Tyro, (having Neptune for his father,) was of undoubted Hellic\r\norigin[584].\r\n\r\nMinor instances of the addiction of the Hellic races to Games may be\r\nfound in the constant practice of the Ithacan Suitors, and in the\r\nresort of the Myrmidons before Troy, during the seclusion of Achilles,\r\nto this method of beguiling their time[585].\r\n\r\nThe case stands only a little less distinctly as to song. There is an\r\nἀοιδὸς in the palace of Priam, as well as in that of Ulysses; one in\r\nthat of Agamemnon, and one in that of Alcinous. The Muses are Olympian\r\nMuses. Olympus geographically was quite as much Hellic as Pelasgian,\r\nand in every other sense, as I believe, far more. We may perhaps most\r\nfairly estimate its national character, by contrasting the Jupiter\r\nof Olympus with the Jupiter of Dodona, and the home of the large and\r\nvaried group of Grecian gods with the solitary grandeur which affords a\r\ntrace of the old Pelasgian worship. In this view Olympus and the Muses\r\nwill be clearly Hellic. Further[586], Thamyris in his boast supposes\r\nthe Muses to be contending against him at the public matches. If I have\r\nbeen correct in tracing such matches to an Hellic source, Thamyris must\r\nhave regarded the Muses as Hellic when he made this supposition. Again,\r\nThamyris himself is a Θρὴξ, that is to say, a highlander: this connects\r\nhim with the Helli of the hills, not with the Pelasgians of the more\r\nopen country. The place, too, where the punishment is inflicted upon\r\nThamyris, is in the dominions of Pylus: which, at any rate for a term\r\nequal to three generations before the _Troica_, had been Achæan, that\r\nis, Hellic[587].\r\n\r\nApollo was doubtless an object of Pelasgian worship: the Apollo of\r\nHomer however is not confined to the Pelasgians, but is by many signs,\r\nscattered throughout the poems, placed in close as well as friendly\r\nrelations with the whole Greek nation. Among these may be reckoned his\r\nacceptance of the propitiation and prayer offered by Calchas. In truth,\r\nthough it is his business, as the organ of Jupiter, to assist the\r\nTrojans, he no where shows any of that hostility to their opponents,\r\nwhich Neptune and Juno show to them.\r\n\r\n_As to poetry and music._\r\n\r\nIn later times, the traditions of Orpheus, Musæus, and Eumolpus, always\r\nΘρῇκες, supported the tradition which derives Greek song from the\r\nmountain tribes.\r\n\r\nWhy has Arcadia a muse of her own, but because the Pelasgian poetry is\r\nnot the Hellic? and does not the reputed character of that muse oblige\r\nus to assign a Hellic origin to the higher national poetry?\r\n\r\nHesiod, as author of the Works and Days, is so enormously different\r\nfrom Homer in his frame of mind, as well as his diction, that it is\r\nhard to trace, even in the most general form, a complete national\r\naffinity between them. The Theogony, by its subject, brought him nearer\r\nto Homer, but it is quite destitute of the heroic power and fire: a\r\ncalm and low-toned beauty, as in the legend of the Ages, is all to\r\nwhich Hesiod ever rises. To my conjecture, he seems to personify the\r\none-stringed instrument which might suffice for Pelasgian song: while\r\nthe Diapason of Homer, embracing with its immeasurable sweep things\r\nsmall and things great, things sublime and things homely, all objects\r\nthat human experience had suggested, and all thoughts that the soul of\r\nman had imagined or received, presents to us that Greek mind, full,\r\nvaried, energetic, lively, profound, exact, which was destined to give\r\nform for so many ages to the genius of the world.\r\n\r\nI cannot however part from this subject, and leave the Hellenic races\r\nin possession of the honour of having principally contributed to\r\nmould the powerful imagination of the Greeks, without noticing the\r\nopposite conclusion of Mr. Fergusson, in his admirable ‘Handbook of\r\nArchitecture.’\r\n\r\nHe treats the Greek nation as made up chiefly of two ingredients, the\r\nDorian and the Pelasgian. He takes the Greeks of the Trojan Epoch to\r\nhave been Pelasgian, and so to have continued until the return of the\r\nHeraclidæ. Then, according to him, began the Hellenic, which he treats\r\nas synonymous with the Doric, preponderance; and, having Sparta before\r\nhim as the one great Hellic type, he observes that the race was far\r\nbetter adapted “for the arts of war and self-government, than for the\r\nsofter arts of poetry and peace[588].”\r\n\r\nBut the supposition of a Pelasgic supremacy in Homeric Greece, is\r\ncontrary to all the evidence afforded by the text of Homer, and, I\r\nthink we may add, to the belief alike of ancient and of modern times.\r\nEven the limited part of the Homeric evidence which is connected with\r\nthe names Ἕλλας and Ἕλληνες, seems large enough to overthrow any such\r\nhypothesis. Though the Dorian race was Hellenic, it was apparently\r\na late outgrowth from the stock, and has no pretension whatever to\r\nbe considered as the universal type of its products. In Sparta, the\r\nexcessive development of policy was doubtless unfavourable to human\r\nexcellence in other forms; among others, to poetry and art. Still,\r\nneither verse, music, nor architecture are disconnected from the Dorian\r\nname and race. It seems quite impossible to refer the war-poetry of\r\nthe Iliad, the grandest in the world, for its origin to a people so\r\nunwarlike, in reference especially to the changeful, romantic, and\r\npoetic side of war, as the Pelasgi.\r\n\r\nThe adventurous tone and tenour of the Odyssey, and its wide range over\r\nthe world, and over the sea, are as little in keeping with what we can\r\nsee of Pelasgic habits in the heroic age. Above all, that largeness and\r\nunimpaired universality of type, which belongs to human character as\r\ndrawn by Homer, and especially to Achilles and Ulysses, demonstrate (I\r\ncannot use a weaker word) that all the materials of Grecian greatness\r\nwere in his time fully ripened.\r\n\r\n_Pelasgian sense of beauty._\r\n\r\nAt the same time it is not necessary to deny, that the Pelasgians\r\nmay have been endowed with a high sense of beauty. Not that Homer\r\nappears to have had a vivid conception of beauty in connection with\r\narchitecture, their great reputed accomplishment; for he seems, on the\r\ncontrary, to have had little idea of ornament in buildings, beyond\r\nthe blaze of plates of polished metal: far different here from what\r\nhe shows himself to be in dealing with dress, or armour, or the forms\r\nof men and horses. But we have before us the fact that through Athens\r\nitself preeminently, and likewise through its colonies to the east, the\r\nGreek race earned in after-times the very highest honours in poetry\r\nand the fine arts. On the one hand, however, a large share of these\r\nhonours, especially in early times, fell to the share of the race\r\ncalled Æolian, which was clearly Hellic, and a principal part of the\r\nHellic family. On the other hand, Arcadia, which remained more purely\r\nPelasgian, while Athens received all sorts of mixtures, never attained\r\nto high distinction in art, nor rose above a modest and tranquil strain\r\nof verse. The great tragedians and the great artists were of a race\r\nthe most composite in all Greece. The natural inference would seem to\r\nbe, that whatever the Pelasgians may have contributed to the general\r\nresult, however they may have afforded for poetry and art (as also they\r\ndid for war) a good raw material, it was only when in combination with\r\nother elements from other sources, that they could attain to great\r\npractical excellence. A lively sense of beauty is, doubtless, not only\r\na condition, but even a foundation: yet a great organising power is as\r\nnecessary for the production of the great works of imagination, as\r\nit was to Lycurgus for the Spartan constitution, or to Aristotle for\r\nphilosophical analysis and construction; and this was the commanding\r\nand sovereign faculty in a mind such as that of Homer.\r\n\r\nThe connection between the Homeric Greeks and the traditions of\r\nhuntsmen is, I think, sufficiently evident from Homer. His hunting\r\nlegends, and the multitude of his hunting similes, are so many signs of\r\nit; and many indications, I think, concur towards forming a belief that\r\nthe Greeks owed their fondness for the chace to their Hellic, not to\r\ntheir Pelasgic habits and blood.\r\n\r\nI take first the relation between Achilles and his instructors.\r\nChiron was the teacher of Achilles in the surgical art, while Phœnix\r\nhad charge of his higher education. Surgery and war would obviously\r\ngo together. But Chiron too gave his father the ashen spear from\r\nPelion, which none but Achilles could wield: he was the most civilized\r\n(δικαιότατος) of the Centaurs, the one to whom the ideas of right, on\r\nwhich society is founded, were most congenial. But he seems to dwell\r\non Mount Pelion, not like Phœnix, in the court of Peleus; he is,\r\ntherefore, without doubt, a huntsman, and is in fact a link between the\r\nold and rude, and the new and more civilized life of the Hellic tribes.\r\n\r\nAgain. Of the Hellic legends of Homer, which are not in all very\r\nnumerous, two have hunting for their subject: as,\r\n\r\n1. That of the Calydonian Boar in Il. ix.\r\n\r\n2. That of the visit of Ulysses to the court of Autolycus, in Od. xix.\r\n\r\nNow these two legends are the only ones in the poems, that do not\r\nrelate to war. Though the Trojans dwelt by Ida, we never hear of their\r\nhunts: but their princes feed sheep upon its slopes, or tend horses in\r\nthe plain below.\r\n\r\n_Evidence as to hunting._\r\n\r\nEven apart from particular evidence, we might presume that, if the\r\nnation derived its warlike turn from a Hellic source, so it must\r\nlikewise have been with hunting, which was next of kin to war.\r\n\r\nLastly, if this supposition be correct, it helps to account for what\r\nis otherwise an anomaly in the poems. Diana fights on the Trojan side:\r\nyet we find no evidence that she was worshipped among the Trojans, or\r\neven known to them in the character, in which she has the greatest\r\nmythical celebrity. She is mentioned but once, I think, among them; it\r\nis by Andromache, and that is as having put a period to her mother’s\r\nlife[589], nowhere in her character as a huntress. But among the Greeks\r\nshe constantly appears otherwise than as in connection with death. Her\r\nepithets, ἀγροτέρη, κελαδεινὴ, ἰοχέαιρα, are far more suitable to the\r\nhuntress, than to the more solemn function of the ministry of Death\r\namong human beings. Again, Helen is compared to her in appearance.\r\nThe calamities of the Kalydonians came upon them in consequence of\r\ntheir neglect as to her worship on a particular occasion[590]; and the\r\nparticular punishment inflicted is the sending a wild boar upon them.\r\nNausicaa[591] is elaborately compared to her, and in this simile she is\r\ndescribed as hunting in Taygetus and Erymanthus. Thus while among the\r\nmore Pelasgic Trojans, she appears only in virtue of the relation to\r\ndeath which (we shall find) she holds from a traditive source[592]; it\r\nis the Hellic influence, which superadds the mythical and imaginative\r\nattributes of the beautiful huntress: and which, in so doing, supplies\r\na marked proof of the addiction of the Hellic tribes to that pursuit.\r\n\r\n_Evidence as to navigation._\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to judge whether the turn of the Greeks for navigation\r\nought to be referred in any degree to a Pelasgian source. Plainly, if\r\nthere was such a source, it was not the main one. We have seen that\r\nonly the most elementary words connected with propulsion by rowing,\r\nappear to bear any sign on them of proceeding from that stock. We\r\ncannot argue from the maritime excellence of the Athenians at a much\r\nlater date to their nautical character in the time of Homer, on account\r\nof the important ethnical changes, which in the mean time they had\r\ngradually, but most thoroughly, undergone. On the other hand, our\r\nfinding the pure Pelasgian population of Arcadia resorting to the\r\ninland country, and wholly destitute of ships, affords a negative\r\nindication. A stronger, and indeed very remarkable one, is supplied by\r\nthe total want of ships among the Trojans, notwithstanding that their\r\nsituation was one highly favourable to the acquisition of maritime\r\npower. Yet Paris needed to have ships built for him in order to effect\r\nhis tour[593], and the building of them appears in the Iliad as\r\nhaving been an event of much note in Troy. On the other hand, Homer\r\nis full of indications of the locomotive tendencies of the Hellic\r\nraces. Among these may be mentioned, the wide circle embraced in\r\nthe adventures of Hercules: the offer of Menelaus[594] to accompany\r\nTelemachus on a journey about Greece: the sojourn of Neoptolemus[595]\r\nin Scyros: the frequent visits of Idomeneus[596] to Sparta before\r\nthe war: the marriage of Theseus[597] to a daughter of the king of\r\nCrete: the journey of Nestor[598] into Thessaly: the pleasure visits\r\nof Autolycus to Ithaca, and of the young Ulysses[599] to Autolycus:\r\nthe evident familiarity of the Poet with the idea of travelling to\r\nrecover debts[600]: the existence of places of wide resort for Games\r\nand Oracles[601]: the custom of assembling from a group of districts\r\nat the funerals of great men[602]: nay, the very choice of the voyages\r\nof Ulysses for the subject of so great a part of the Odyssey, and the\r\nlengthened tour of Menelaus. And while the Pelasgians appear to be akin\r\nto the land-loving Egyptians, we have found the Hellenes to be strongly\r\nsympathetic in character with the Phœnicians, the great masters of\r\nnavigation in the heroic age.\r\n\r\nFrom the speech of the Pseudo-Ulysses in the Fourteenth Odyssey, we\r\nhave the strongest evidence that navigation and agricultural pursuits,\r\nwhich were those of the Pelasgians, stood in sharp opposition to one\r\nanother. He could not bear tillage, but loved ships and war[603].\r\n\r\n                ἔργον δέ μοι οὐ φίλον ἦεν,\r\n    οὐδ’ οἰκωφελίη, ἥτε τρέφει ἀγλαὰ τέκνα·\r\n    ἀλλά μοι αἰεὶ νῆες ἐπήρετμοι φίλοι ἦσαν\r\n    καὶ πόλεμοι καὶ ἄκοντες ἐΰξεστοι καὶ ὀïστοί.\r\n\r\nIt is also plain, from two circumstances at least, that Homer regarded\r\ntravelling as one great means of mental and practical culture. One is,\r\nthat he describes this benefit as attained in the case of his great\r\nhero Ulysses;\r\n\r\n                      ὃς μάλα πολλὰ\r\n    πλάγχθη ...\r\n    πολλῶν δ’ ἀνθρώπων ἴδεν ἄστεα, καὶ νόον ἔγνω[604].\r\n\r\nThe other is that, in the very remarkable simile of the Thought, he\r\ntreats travelling as the great stimulus to the growth of the mind of\r\nman:\r\n\r\n    ὡς δ’ ὅτ’ ἂν ἀΐξῃ νόος ἀνέρος, ὅς τ’ ἐπὶ πολλήν\r\n    γαῖαν ἐληλουθὼς φρεσὶ πευκαλίμῃσι νοήσῃ·\r\n    ἔνθ’ εἴην, ἢ ἔνθα· μενοινήῃσί τε πολλά[605].\r\n\r\nBoth as to navigation then, and as to locomotion, which stand nearly\r\nrelated to each other, it would seem that we ought probably to regard\r\nthe Hellic stock as the parent of the Greek accomplishment.\r\n\r\n_Summary of the case._\r\n\r\nAfter this laborious and microscopic investigation, we may now be\r\njustified in taking a survey more at ease of the ground which we have\r\ntraversed so slowly, and in endeavouring to embody our general results\r\nin a rude sketch of the succession, places, and functions of the two\r\ngreat races of early Greece.\r\n\r\nRelying, therefore, upon what has been produced in the way of proof,\r\nI will proceed to fill up its interstices with such conjectures as\r\nprobable reasoning will supply.\r\n\r\nThe Greek nation was originally formed of two great coefficients, the\r\nHellic and Pelasgic races respectively: and there is no evidence, that\r\nany other race entered largely into its composition, or modified it\r\nsensibly: although individual foreigners or companies of emigrants,\r\nwhich left little impression on the names of districts or races, may\r\nnotwithstanding have exercised a powerful influence from time to time.\r\nWe may consider the Leleges, Caucones, and other pre-Hellenic tribes as\r\nbranches of the Pelasgian family, or as akin to it rather than to the\r\nHellic stem.\r\n\r\nThere is Homeric and post-Homeric evidence, which seems to shew us the\r\nPelasgians established through Greece from Macedonia in the north,\r\nto Crete in the south: as well as in Italy, and elsewhere beyond the\r\nborders of Greece.\r\n\r\nIt is on the whole most probable, that the Pelasgians principally\r\nentered Greece from the south by Crete; but they may have entered\r\nit in both directions. In either case, there is no other people\r\nto dispute with them in continental Greece the title of its first\r\nregular settlers. They chose their habitations in the plains, and\r\nwere essentially a lowland people. It is even likely that they derive\r\ntheir name from this characteristic, and that it marks them at once as\r\nagriculturists.\r\n\r\nAs respects the religion of Greece, its most essential features were\r\nprobably common to the two races: a principle illustrated by the fact\r\nthat the Helli, by a kind of natural succession, become the wardens and\r\ninterpreters of the great Pelasgian shrine of Jupiter at Dodona.\r\n\r\nThe first form of the religion of Greece was probably due to\r\nthe Pelasgians; and moreover it would appear to be from them\r\nthat it received, in the main, its ritual and hierarchical, as\r\ncontradistinguished from its imaginative, development. They appear to\r\nhave incorporated it in visible institutions, and to have given social\r\norder to the country; probably in that form in which men live sparsely,\r\nand not in the large aggregations of considerable cities. But social\r\norder in any form implies some means of defence against the lawless:\r\nand we must view the Pelasgians as having introduced the construction\r\nof works of this class, which were then of prime necessity to the\r\nexistence of communities. Their standing pursuit was evidently that of\r\nagriculture: the only link of connection established by Homer between\r\nthem and the beautiful in art, is the doubtful one of the epithets\r\nπερικαλλέα and καλὰ[606] applied to the architecture of the palaces of\r\nPriam and Paris respectively.\r\n\r\nIn general, the Pelasgian race, though without the vivid temperament of\r\nthe Hellic tribes, yet would appear to have been both brave and solid\r\nin character.\r\n\r\nThe stream of Pelasgic immigration, flowing chiefly northward, is met\r\nby the counter-stream of Hellic tribes, proceeding from the highland\r\nnation of the Helli, which had taken its seat in the mountains to the\r\nnorth of Thessaly.\r\n\r\nThey in their southward course overspread the same countries which the\r\nPelasgi had already occupied; successive tribes of immigrants going\r\nforth from the parent stock at different times, as the pressure of\r\npopulation on the means of subsistence required it, and under different\r\nnames, taken in all likelihood from their leaders.\r\n\r\nIn the nest of mountaineers, barbarism, or at least rudeness,\r\ncontinues: but as the young broods go forth, and make their way into\r\nmore favourable conditions of physical and social life, their great\r\ncapacities for development find scope, and they rapidly assume a new\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nBy their greater energy and activity, they became everywhere the\r\ndominant race. Policy and war fell into their hands: they supplied the\r\nmore vigorous, intellectual, and imaginative element in the wonderful\r\ncomposition of the Greek mind. Of the Pelasgian imagination it is\r\ndifficult to speak in a definite manner: but it probably had not that\r\nmasculine tone, and energetic movement, when alone, which marks the\r\nmind of Greece.\r\n\r\nFar more expansive than their Pelasgian antecessors, the Hellic tribes\r\navailed themselves of the great advantages which the country offers\r\nfor extended navigation, which was so essential as a means both of\r\ncommunication, and of attracting the elements of civilization from\r\nabroad. They were apt pupils under apt instructors, the Phœnician\r\nmariners. They developed the Pelasgic religion into their more enlarged\r\nand diversified mythology: they idealized the visible world together\r\nwith human nature, and established those peculiar and pervasively\r\npoetical relations between the seen and the unseen spheres of\r\nexistence, which are the basis of the Greek mythology. Their keen sense\r\nof the beautiful led them to adorn both the body and the mind of man\r\nwith the attributes of deity, while their imaginative power continually\r\nprompted them both to clothe celestial objects in shapes borrowed from\r\nthe visible world, and to equip the gods with sentiments and passions\r\ndrawn from the sphere of every day experience.\r\n\r\nThey likewise brought with them the gymnastic element of the Greek\r\nsystem, the education of the body; and they made provision for this\r\neducation, in conjunction with a powerful means of national union, in\r\nthe Games which became so famous through so many ages.\r\n\r\nThe same qualities which found employment in fashioning the relations\r\nof earth to heaven, were likewise busy in uniting the past with the\r\npresent, by the agency of history in the form of song.\r\n\r\nOf this race were the Achæans, who by their power and extension through\r\nGreece, gave to it and to its people their first famous designation,\r\nthat which they bore in the Homeric times. From the same source\r\nproceeded all the Hellenes, derivatively so called, and the Myrmidons.\r\nUnder the great Achæan name, understood in its special sense, are\r\nprobably included with the Pelopids, the Pylians, Cephallenians,\r\nEpeans, Myrmidons, Loerians. Nor can we be certain that it did not also\r\ninclude those Æolid families whose power and extension subsequently\r\nimpressed large portions of Greece with the Æolian name.\r\n\r\nWhile imperial cares and aims, and the refinements and enjoyments,\r\ntogether with the stir, movement, and solicitude of life, fell to the\r\nHellic portion of the Greek societies, and took its form from them,\r\nthe Pelasgian element, though depressed below the surface, continued\r\nto live and act with vigour; it predominated in the classes which form\r\nthe solid _substratum_ of society, those on which rural industry, if\r\nnot those on which mechanical pursuits depended, and from which the\r\nupper surface, when exhausted by the prolonged performance of its\r\nfunctions, may draw in every society successive stocks of new materials\r\nto renovate its vital forces.\r\n\r\nWhile Homer himself seems to represent the unbounded wealth and\r\nfulness, and the manifold and versatile power, of the composite Greek\r\nmind, we appear to have, in the rural strains of Hesiod, if not in the\r\nunenlivened theogonic traditions ascribed to him, the just and natural\r\nexemplification of all that we might expect in a Pelasgic poet.\r\n\r\n_States especially Hellic or Pelasgic._\r\n\r\nIn later, as well as in Homeric times, the Arcadians seem in the most\r\nmarked manner to have exhibited the Pelasgic aspect of the Greek mind\r\nand life: and they show it much in the same relation to the Hellic\r\nraces, as that of the Saxons to the Norman chivalry. Like the Saxons,\r\nit was not in bravery that they failed: they were ἐγχεσίμωροι and\r\nἐπιστάμενοι πολεμίζειν: but in energy and passion, and likewise in\r\ngoverning and organizing powers, they were beneath the competing race,\r\nand therefore they gave way: while, from their enduring and solid\r\nqualities, they were well qualified in after generations to supply the\r\ngreater waste caused by a more vivid temperament and keener action in\r\nthe soil above them.\r\n\r\nAmong the Spartans we find developed, in a very peculiar degree, two\r\nof the imperial elements of the Greek character. The first is that\r\npolitical faculty of the Hellic races, by which, as Strabo says, they\r\npreserved their ἡγεμονία from the time of Lycurgus, down to the fifth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nAnd the second is, the idea of the education of the body, as an\r\nessential and main part of human training: a sentiment which to us may\r\nseem narrow, but we must remember that the Greeks kept fully in their\r\nview what we have dropped from our theories, though it may be hoped,\r\nnot wholly from our practice, namely, the influence of bodily exercise\r\nand discipline in forming mental qualities and habits.\r\n\r\nIt was to Attica, however, that was reserved the offices of exhibiting\r\nin the fullest degree the manysidedness of the Greek character: and\r\nthe efficient cause, by which she was fitted to fulfil this function,\r\nprobably may have been that constant infusion of new blood by the\r\nsuccessive immigrations of the different Greek races, without the\r\nabsolute displacement of any of them on a large scale, which, as we\r\nhave seen, Thucydides remarks to have been her special characteristic.\r\nHence she always exhibited both the ancient and the fresh; both, too,\r\nin the highest degree; urging, like Arcadia, the autochthonic origin of\r\nher population, which must refer to its Pelasgic element; contending\r\nwith that state, and with Argos[607], for the honour of the traditions\r\ntouching Pelasgus and the worship of Ceres; but richer at the same time\r\nthan any other Greek State, in the varied aggregate of the qualities,\r\nwhich the composite or entire Greek mind appears to have owed to\r\nHellic infusion. Hence the breadth of the transition which, according\r\nto Herodotus[608], she had made from the Pelasgic to the Hellenic\r\ncharacter: and yet she had made it without any visible breach in the\r\ncontinuity of her social and political traditions.\r\n\r\nThough Thessaly was the country in which, to all appearance, the Hellic\r\ntribes, coming down from the poverty and rudeness of their highland\r\nlife, first began to develope their amazing powers, and to acquire\r\ncivilization, yet it was rather, so to speak, their caravansera or\r\nhalting house, than their abode.\r\n\r\nThe Helli, thus travelling through Hellas, give it a name, and receive\r\nfrom it one in return; so that when they pass on to the southward,\r\nthey are no longer Helli but Hellenes, and have only a secondary\r\nand derivative relation to their original home and stock. It is\r\nintelligible, that they should not wish to claim too close a kindred\r\nwith the ἀνιπτόποδες χαμαίευναι of Homer[609], although most ready to\r\nown the relationship in solemn appeals to the ancient seat of Jupiter.\r\nEven in Homer’s time, they had advanced very far ahead of the habits\r\nthus ascribed to them: for when the Greek chiefs return from the\r\nDoloneia, they first wash in the sea, then pass into the bath, and\r\nthirdly are anointed, before they begin their well-earned meal[610].\r\n\r\nThe rapidity of their growth in numbers, and of their propagation\r\nsouthwards, might be due to their having settled on a fertile plain;\r\nwhile necessities, arising from the vicissitudes of climate, would\r\nbe the probable and less copious cause of migration from the hills.\r\nBut in any case, whether from the rapidity of their passage through\r\nThessaly, or from their having actually occupied no more than a small\r\nportion of it, they left it in the Homeric, and apparently also in\r\nthe Hesiodic period, still partly impressed, as they must have found\r\nit, with the Pelasgic name[611]. The prolonged existence of this\r\nappellation indicates in part perhaps the predominance of the Pelasgic\r\nelement in this country, in part the fugacious character of the Hellic\r\nsettlement, of which only the Achæan portion lived through the historic\r\ntimes in such a degree of force as to maintain its visible identity:\r\nthis, too, according to post-Homeric tradition, was peopled by the\r\nMyrmidons from the south, and not directly from the region of the Helli.\r\n\r\nThessaly, then, was the nursery or cradle of the Hellic or Hellenic\r\nraces, but it was no more. Consequently with the lapse of time, as it\r\nwanted the true mixture of ingredients, Thessaly became less and less\r\nGreek in its essential habits and sympathies: while from its preserving\r\na federal constitution, under a federal head, the τάγος, we may also\r\nrefer to its more Pelasgian character the apparent fact, that it was\r\nnot so liable to political change, or νεωτέρισις, as were the less\r\nPelasgian parts of Greece. When, after centuries of vicissitude, the\r\noutward notes of its original blood were almost gone, Pelasgian feeling\r\nstill survived: for Thucydides relates that, when Brasidas entered\r\nThessaly at the head of the Lacedæmonian army, he found the mass of the\r\npeople attached by affection to the Athenian cause, and had to rely on\r\naristocratic influence to furnish him with guides[612].\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[516] See Studies on the Theo-mythology of Homer.\r\n\r\n[517] Fasti, i. 39.\r\n\r\n[518] De Nat.

VIII.\r\n\r\n_On the three greater Homeric appellatives._\r\n\r\n_a._ Danaans. _b._ Argives. _c._ Achæans.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now come to the great Homeric appellatives, Danaan, Argive, and\r\nAchæan. As Thucydides has said (i. 3), Δαναοὺς δὲ ἐν τοῖς ἔπεσι, καὶ\r\nἈργείους, καὶ Ἀχαιοὺς ἀνακαλεῖ. Why has the great historian arranged\r\nthe three names in this order? It cannot be with reference to the\r\ncomparative frequency of their use: for the first is employed the\r\nsmallest number of times, and the third is by far the most frequent.\r\nFor the present let us postpone seeking after the cause; and simply\r\nnote it as probable, even if no more than probable, that there _is_ a\r\ncause.\r\n\r\n_Modes of formation for Names of Peoples._\r\n\r\nLet me, by way of preface to the examination of these names, consider\r\nthe various ways in which, so far as we have the means of tracing them\r\n(which is but to a limited extent), the names attached by Homer to the\r\ninhabitants of particular countries are derived.\r\n\r\nThey appear to come either\r\n\r\n1. From an eponymist directly, who is also an original founder, as\r\nΔαρδανοὶ, Τρῶες, from Dardanus, and Tros, in relation to Dardania and\r\nTroja respectively.\r\n\r\n2. From the land they live in: and thus from an eponymist, if there has\r\noriginally been one for the territory.\r\n\r\nFor example, we find Ἰθακήσιοι from an island Ἰθακὴ, which again was\r\nderived from Ἰθακός. In a case like this, when the appellation of\r\nthe people comes not directly, but mediately from the name-giver, a\r\nterritorial designation intervening, we can draw no inference as to\r\nthe oneness of race between them and him. Thus in the case before us,\r\nἸθακήσιοι, though connected with Ἰθακὴ, has not as of necessity, any\r\nconnection whatever with Ἰθακὸς personally.\r\n\r\n3. From the land they live in, as described by its most prominent\r\nphysical characteristic.\r\n\r\nFor example, the Thracians (Θρῇκες), must evidently be so called from\r\nthe roughness of the country, as a cognate word to τρῆχυς, which is\r\nthus applied to Ithaca,\r\n\r\n    τρηχεῖ’, ἀλλ’ ἀγαθὴ κουρότροφος. Odyss. ix. 27.\r\n\r\nAgain, from Αἰγίαλος, the district afterwards called Achæa, we have,\r\nin later Greek[613], the name Αἰγιαλεῖς for the inhabitants. This does\r\nnot occur in Homer, but we have what is equivalent to it in the name of\r\nΑἰγιάλεια, who was wife of Diomed, and daughter of Adrastus, the former\r\nking of Sicyon in Ægialus. This is an instance of the application of\r\nthe principle, not to the inhabitants at large, but to an individual\r\ninhabitant.\r\n\r\n4. The name of a population may be derived secondarily from that of\r\nanother population. Thus while we must derive Ἕλληνες from Ἕλλας, this\r\nin its turn can only be drawn from the Ἕλλοι.\r\n\r\n5. In the single case of the Athenians, we find the name of a\r\npopulation derived from that of a deity.\r\n\r\n6. It is presumable, though not certain, that entire populations took\r\ntheir name from ruling individuals or races. It seems hardly possible\r\nto explain, for example, the name Καδμεῖοι, which nowhere connects\r\nitself with any of the foregoing sources of eponymism, otherwise than\r\nby reference to an individual Cadmus, whom Homer mentions in Od. v. 333.\r\n\r\nThe idea prevails extensively, at least by sufferance, that these three\r\ngreat names are in Homer mere synonyms, and have no reference to any\r\nactual and historical differences, either existing when Homer wrote, or\r\nknown by him to have existed at a previous period.\r\n\r\nThis question it is proposed now to examine. I commence by making a\r\nbroad admission. It is this.\r\n\r\nUpon the face of the poems, and on almost all ordinary occasions,\r\nHomer seems at first sight to use, and he very frequently does use,\r\nas equivalent and interchangeable, those three principal designations\r\nwhich he applies to the Greeks in common.\r\n\r\n_Homer’s use of them distinctive._\r\n\r\nIt is a very important question, however, whether Homer knew of and\r\nobserved any distinctions between these names. For if he did, then\r\nthese mere commonplace words, as they are taken to be, may involve in\r\nthem the germ of much early history.\r\n\r\nIn this investigation, we have the advantage of dealing in great\r\npart, not with mere traditional assertion, but with facts. The use of\r\nparticular names, at particular epochs, for particular tribes, affords\r\n(if the text can be trusted for genuineness) a class of evidence\r\nanalogous to that supplied by coins and inscriptions for history, or\r\nthat afforded by geological phænomena with respect to the formation of\r\nthe globe.\r\n\r\nThe poems of Homer, particularly the Iliad, abound in passages relating\r\nto prior occurrences. These passages are not in general of a high\r\norder of poetical beauty, as compared with the rest of the poem; they\r\noften cause the action to hang rather heavily; many of them make\r\nup the speeches of old men, whose natural leaning to loquacity it\r\nappears that the Poet has, with his usual skill, made to minister\r\nto the accomplishment of his own marked historic aims. But they are\r\nrepositories stored, we may almost say packed, with the most curious\r\nand suggestive information.\r\n\r\nSome of them may be without date: but the time is generally fixed\r\nwithin limits sufficiently close, either by genealogies, or by the\r\nperiod in the lives of the narrators, to which the tales belong. The\r\nwar of the Elians and Pylians in the Eleventh Book took place in the\r\nboyhood of Nestor: probably from fifty to sixty years before the war\r\nof Troy. The birth of Eurystheus, related in the Nineteenth Book, was\r\nprobably earlier still by ten or twenty years. The other legends fall\r\ninto the interval between these events and the _Troica_. Now if we can\r\ntrace a difference in the application by Homer of his appellatives,\r\neither as to the times or the places, he may hereby conclusively,\r\nthough unconsciously, tell us a good deal about his view of the\r\nsuccession, and the local distribution, of ruling races in Greece.\r\n\r\nSuch a rule of difference is easy to be traced.\r\n\r\nFor example. In the Catalogue[614] and elsewhere, if in the course of\r\nthe action he refers to the soldiers who proceeded from the country\r\nafterwards called Bœotia, he calls them Βοιωτοί. But where Agamemnon\r\nhas, or rather makes, occasion to tell a story of the same people\r\nacting in prior history, he calls them, not Βοιωτοὶ, but once Καδμεῖοι,\r\nand once by the equivalent name Καδμειῶνες[615]. The tale is an account\r\nof the mission of Tydeus from Thebes to Mycenæ, in company with\r\nPolynices, which had occurred under the Pelopid dynasty.\r\n\r\nIn this story it appears, that Tydeus and Polynices, first obtained\r\na promise of the help they wanted; but that, after they had departed,\r\nthere was a change of resolution. Hence messengers were sent to\r\nacquaint Tydeus, and apparently to recall the force. The expression is\r\n(Il. iv. 384),\r\n\r\n    ἔνθ’ αὖτ’ ἀγγελίην ἐπὶ Τύῃ στεῖλαν Ἀχαιοί.\r\n\r\nAn allusion to this occurrence is again put into the mouth of Minerva\r\nin Il. v. 800-7. The resemblance in the names used is so precise as\r\nto be almost _precisian_. Again, the Mycenians are named once, and\r\nnamed as Ἀχαιοί. Again, the Thebans are named twice, and once it is as\r\nΚαδμεῖοι, once as Καδμείωνες.\r\n\r\n_Proofs of the distinctive use._\r\n\r\nThese two instances fortify one another to such a degree by their\r\nconcurrence, that, as I would submit, they would, even if they stood\r\nalone, amount to a demonstration that Homer had regard to the times\r\nand circumstances under which the several races prevailed, in those\r\npassages of his work which refer to particular incidents of prior\r\nhistory, personal and local. But there is no lack of other evidence.\r\n\r\nFirst, we have other pieces of prior history, which affect the same\r\nportion of Greece. The first of these probably preceded the _Troica_\r\nby only two, or, at the utmost, two and a half generations. It is the\r\naccount of the birth of Eurystheus, given by Agamemnon himself in the\r\nNineteenth Book. The scene of it is described as Ἄργος Ἀχαιïκόν. He\r\ncalls it indeed by the name, which it still bore at the time when he\r\nspoke, and which was understood by the hearers, for it remained the\r\nsame country as it had been in former times. But the same people, who\r\nin the time of Tydeus, living under the Pelopids, were Ἀχαιοὶ, in\r\nthe time of Eurystheus, and therefore before the predominance of the\r\nPelopids, are described as Ἀργεῖοι. In Il. xix. 122, Juno thus speaks\r\nof the birth of Eurystheus\r\n\r\n    ἤδη ἀνὴρ γέγον’ ἐσθλὸς, ὃς Ἀργείοισιν ἀνάξει.\r\n\r\nAnd again, v. 124, the same term is used.\r\n\r\nAgain, it appears from the Sixth Iliad that Prœtus, who expelled\r\nBellerophon about the same time, was king of the Ἀργεῖοι (Il. vi. 158);\r\n\r\n    ὅς ῥ’ ἐκ δήμου ἔλασσεν, ἐπεὶ πολὺ φέρτερος ἦεν\r\n    Ἀργείων.\r\n\r\nAccording to extra-Homeric tradition, Prœtus was the brother of\r\nEurystheus. According to Homer, his power extends over Ephyre, and over\r\nthe Argives: and as Æolid dynasties were then ruling in the west, it\r\nis the country afterwards called the Argos of the Achæans, within some\r\npart of which he must have ruled. But in telling both the story of\r\nPrœtus, and the story of Eurystheus, with reference to the same side of\r\nPeloponnesus, and entirely out of connection with one another, the text\r\nof Homer, true to itself, calls the subjects of each at that period,\r\nonly by the name Ἀργεῖοι, never Δαναοὶ or Ἀχαιοί.\r\n\r\nThus, one generation before the _Troica_ he calls people Achæans, and\r\ncalls them by that name only, whom one or two generations earlier he\r\ndescribes, and repeatedly and uniformly describes, as having been\r\nArgives. There can hardly be stronger circumstantial evidence of the\r\nfact, that to each term he attached its own special meaning.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it is not simply that Homer has made the Argive the more\r\nancient, and the Achæan the more recent, name. On the contrary, he uses\r\nboth the one and the other with marked respect to place as well as to\r\ntime. For at the great Argive epoch he has Achæans: and at the great\r\nAchæan epoch, that of the poems, he has Argive associations, and a\r\nlocal Argive designation, still remaining.\r\n\r\nIn the Eleventh Book, Nestor detains Patroclus with a speech of\r\ngreat length. In the beginning of this harangue, he refers to the\r\ncircumstances of the moment, and, having ended his preface, he travels\r\nback to his own early youth, indeed almost his childhood, to give the\r\nstory of a war, or foray, between the Epeans and the Pylians. When\r\nhe has ended this tale, he returns to the actual position of affairs\r\nbefore Troy.\r\n\r\nIn the narrative of this raid[616], he commonly terms the one side\r\nEpeans, and the other Pylians. But he once calls the Epeans, who were\r\ninhabitants of Elis, Elians. This is natural enough: for as the Elian\r\nname afterwards (and so soon as in the time of Homer) prevailed in\r\nthat race and country, it might very well have been already beginning\r\nto come into use. But he also calls the Pylians Achæans; and he uses\r\nthe name distinctively, for it is where he is speaking of them as the\r\nconquering party[617]. For this there is clearly no corresponding\r\nreason. It is equally clear that Homer does not call the Pylians\r\nἈχαιοὶ, simply in the sense of being Greeks, for then the name would\r\nnot have been distinctive: the enemy too would have been included with\r\nthem, which would turn the passage into nonsense. Homer, then, (there\r\nis no other alternative) means to say that the Pylians were, in some\r\nparticular sense, of the Achæan race.\r\n\r\nThis is the more worthy of remark, when we look to the preamble and\r\nperoration of the speech. For in both of these, which refer to the\r\nwhole body of the Greeks and to the Trojan epoch, he employs his usual\r\nnames, and calls them both Danaans (Δαναῶν οὐ κήδεται, v. 665, also\r\nvid. 797), and Argives (Ἀργείων ἀέκητι, v. 667): finally Achæans (υἷες\r\nἈχαιῶν, 800).\r\n\r\nThus then he calls the Pylians Achæans at the time of the Argive\r\npredominance: for this local war could hardly have been more than ten\r\nor twenty years after the birth of Eurystheus, and must therefore have\r\nbeen before, or else during his reign; that is to say, at a time when\r\nhis own subjects are called Ἀργεῖοι.\r\n\r\nAgain. Homer uses the word Ἀργεῖος in the feminine singular fifteen\r\ntimes. Twice it is with reference to Juno. Of course this application\r\nof the term is figurative. But though it be figurative, the figure\r\nis evidently founded on her close and intimate relation, not to the\r\nGreeks at large only, but to the Argive name; and to the persons, but\r\nmore particularly to the place, that was so specially associated with\r\nit[618].\r\n\r\nIn all the other thirteen places, the epithet is joined with the name\r\nof Helen. Does it for her mean simply Greek, or something special and\r\nbeyond this? Now if it meant simply Greek, it would be strange that\r\nshe is never called, I will not say Δαναὴ, because the Danaan name has\r\nno singular use in Homer, but certainly Ἀχαιὴ or Ἀχαίïς. Especially as\r\nthe word Ἀχαιὸς is used as an epithet, be it remembered, many times\r\noftener, than is Ἀργεῖος: and it alone is used to describe the women of\r\nGreece generally.\r\n\r\nAgain, if the epithet Argive, as applied to Helen, meant simply Greek,\r\nit might be suitable enough in the mouth of a Trojan speaking among\r\nTrojans, but it would have been weak and unmeaning, and therefore most\r\nunlike Homer, in the mouth of a Greek or a friend of Greeks; or when,\r\nas in the Odyssey[619], Helen is no longer among strangers, but at\r\nhome. Yet it is used in the following passages among others, (1) by\r\nJuno to Minerva, Il. ii. 161, (2) by Minerva to Ulysses, Il. ii. 177;\r\nand here in a near juxtaposition with the Achæan appellative, which\r\ngoes far to prove of itself that Ἀργείη has a meaning more specific\r\nthan merely Greek. The passage is,\r\n\r\n    Ἀργείην Ἑλένην, ἧς εἵνεκα πολλοὶ Ἀχαιῶν\r\n    ἐν Τροίῃ ἀπόλοντο.\r\n\r\nI doubt whether Homer ever places in such proximity the two epithets\r\nwith the same meaning for each[620]. The tautology would be gross, if\r\nAchæan and Argeian each meant neither more nor less than Greek: but if\r\nἈργείη have the local sense, nothing awkward remains. (3) It is used by\r\nAgamemnon, Il. iii. 458, in addressing the Trojans; (4) Il. iv. 174, in\r\naddressing Menelaus; (5) Il. ix. 140, in addressing the Greek Council.\r\nIt seems quite clear, from even this enumeration, that Ἀργείη, as\r\napplied to Helen, must mean something different from the mere fact that\r\nshe belonged to the Greek nation at large.\r\n\r\nNor is it difficult to find a meaning. Homer indeed leaves us but\r\nnarrow information as to the extraction of Helen. He calls her\r\nsometimes εὐπατέρεια[621], and many times Διὸς ἐκγεγαυῖα[622]. In the\r\nThird Iliad he shows her to be the sister of Castor and Pollux, and\r\nin the Eleventh Odyssey he shows them to be the children of Tyndareus\r\nand Leda[623]. Who Tyndareus was we do not know from him. But the\r\ncommon tradition, which makes him a sovereign in Eastern Peloponnesus,\r\nis thoroughly accordant with the slight notices in Homer. For, as\r\nwe see from the cases of Eurystheus and Prœtus, it was in Eastern\r\nPeloponnesus that the Argive power and name prevailed; and Helen, the\r\ndaughter of Tyndareus is, as we have also seen, characteristically\r\nwith him the Argive Helen. Thus then it may now be lawful to say, we\r\nare supplied with a meaning for the name which makes it especially\r\nappropriate in the mouth of Agamemnon, the head of the Pelopids. For\r\nthey were the race who, coming in at the head of the Achæans, had from\r\nthe West overpowered and superseded the Argive power of the East,\r\nwhile they also held as heirs to it by marriage: and if a royal Argive\r\nhouse at the epoch of the war survived only in Helen and her sister\r\nClytemnestra, she in part at least represented its title, and, as a\r\nlawful wife of Menelaus, added to his throne whatever authority the\r\nname and rights of her race were capable of conferring.\r\n\r\nHaving, I trust, seen enough to justify the belief that some at least\r\nof these names in the mind of Homer had a definite as well as a more\r\ngeneral meaning, let us now, taking them in succession, proceed to\r\nexamine what that meaning is.\r\n\r\n_The Danaans of Homer._\r\n\r\nAmong the three great Homeric appellatives, let us direct our attention\r\nfirst to the one, which is presumably the oldest. The word Δαναοὶ, from\r\nthe comparative paucity of the signs and indications connected with it,\r\nevidently answers to this description.\r\n\r\nWe will take first the Homeric, and then the later, evidence respecting\r\nit. Of the former, the greater number of particulars are negative.\r\nIndeed we have but two positive notes to dwell upon; both of these,\r\nhowever, are of great importance.\r\n\r\n1. The Danaan name is with Homer a standing appellation of the Greeks.\r\nI think, however, it can be shown that it never means the Greek nation,\r\nbut always the Greek armament or soldiery.\r\n\r\nIt is used in the Iliad one hundred and forty-seven times. The name\r\nἈργεῖοι is employed oftener, namely, one hundred and seventy-seven\r\ntimes in the plural, besides eleven times in the singular as a personal\r\nepithet: and Ἀχαιοὶ much more frequently still.\r\n\r\n_His epithets for the three designations._\r\n\r\nIf we observe the shadings, attached to these words respectively by\r\nmeans of the epithets which Homer annexes to them, we shall find they\r\nestablish perceptible distinctions.\r\n\r\nThe epithets of Δαναοὶ are exclusively military epithets:\r\n\r\n  1. ἥρωες.\r\n  2. θεράποντες Ἄρηος.\r\n  3. φιλοπτόλεμοι.\r\n  4. αἰχμηταί.\r\n  5. ἀσπισταί.\r\n  6. ἴφθιμοι.\r\n  7. ταχύπωλοι.\r\n\r\nThe epithets of Ἀργεῖοι are as follows:\r\n\r\n  1. ἰόμωροι, Il. iv. 242. xiv. 479.\r\n  2. ἀπειλάων ἀκόρητοι, Il. xiv. 479.\r\n  3. θωρηκτοί, Il. xxi. 429.\r\n  4. φιλοπτόλεμοι, Il. xix. 269.\r\n  5. ἐλεγχέες, Il. iv. 242.\r\n\r\nUpon these we may observe, first, that they are few in number;\r\nsecondly, that they are used with extreme rarity; being only applied\r\nin four passages altogether, whereas the word Δαναοὶ has epithets in\r\ntwenty-two. Thirdly, this word only twice in the whole of the poems\r\nhas a military epithet attached to it. For I must follow those, who do\r\nnot translate ἰόμωροι as corresponding with ἐγχεσίμωροι: (1) because\r\nthe Greeks were not archers, (2) because the derivation from ἴα,\r\n‘the voice,’ giving the sense of braggart, harmonises exactly with\r\nthe accompanying phrase ἀπειλάων ἀκόρητοι: as well as (3) for the\r\npresumptive, but in Homer by no means conclusive, reason, that ἴον in\r\ncomposition is long.\r\n\r\nThe epithets of Ἀχαιοὶ are numerous, highly varied, and of very\r\nfrequent use. They are these:\r\n\r\n  1. ἀπειλητῆρες.\r\n  2. μάχης ἀκόρητοι.\r\n  3. ἀνάλκιδες.\r\n  4. δῖοι.\r\n  5. ἑλικῶπες.\r\n  6. εὐκνήμιδες.\r\n  7. ἥρωες.\r\n  8. καρηκομόωντες.\r\n  9. μεγάθυμοι.\r\n  10. μένεα πνείοντες.\r\n  11. χαλκοκνήμιδες.\r\n  12. χαλκοχίτωνες.\r\n  13. ὑπερκύδαντες.\r\n  14. ἀρηίφιλοι.\r\n  15. φιλοπτόλεμοι.\r\n\r\nThese epithets are used in nearly one hundred and thirty passages, and\r\nthey may be classified as comprising,\r\n\r\n  (1) One or two words of sarcastic reproach, very rarely used.\r\n\r\n  (2) Words descriptive of courage and spirit: such are μεγάθυμοι,\r\n  μένεα πνείοντες.\r\n\r\n  (3) Words indicating that disposition to brag, which is more or less\r\n  traceable in the military conduct of the Greeks, as well as glaringly\r\n  palpable among the Trojans.\r\n\r\n  (4) Words descriptive of personal beauty: ἑλικῶπες and καρηκομόωντες.\r\n\r\n  (5) The word δῖοι, which signifies generally the possession of some\r\n  kind of excellence.\r\n\r\n  (6) Words relating to well made and well finished armour: εὐκνήμιδες,\r\n  χαλκοκνήμιδες, χαλκοχίτωνες.\r\n\r\nAnd of the epithets of the three appellatives respectively we may say,\r\n\r\n  (1) Those of Ἀχαιοὶ are highly diversified, extended, and elevated in\r\n  meaning: and are not suitable for soldiers exclusively.\r\n\r\n  (2) Those of Ἀργεῖοι are so slight and rare that they may be passed\r\n  over.\r\n\r\n  (3) Those of Δαναοὶ are most properly neither those of chiefs, nor of\r\n  a nation at large, but of a soldiery.\r\n\r\nIn the Odyssey the Danaan name is used thirteen times: but it never\r\nsignifies either the Greeks contemporary with the action of that\r\npoem, or the Greek nation in its prior history: it is employed always\r\nretrospectively, and always of the soldiery in the Trojan war.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed by readers of the poems, that Homer often brings\r\ntwo of the three great appellatives, or even all the three, into\r\njuxtaposition so near, as would be inconvenient upon the supposition\r\nthat they are purely synonymous. For instance, in Il. i. 71, we have\r\nἈργεῖοι and Ἀχαιοὶ in the same line, and in Il. i. 90, 91, Δαναοὶ and\r\nἈχαιοὶ in two successive lines. It is, I think, obvious, that this\r\ninconvenience will be mitigated or removed, if it can be shown that\r\neach of these three names, though they were most commonly applied\r\nto mean the same body of persons, nevertheless had its own shade\r\nof meaning. And we shall presently have to examine cases, where a\r\ndetermination of this kind appears to be required by the sense[624].\r\n\r\nAll the rest of the Homeric evidence connected with the name Δαναοὶ is\r\nof a negative character.\r\n\r\nIt is never used in the singular number, either as an adjective, or as\r\na substantive. Nor is it ever applied to women: a point not immaterial,\r\nin connection with the question, whether with Homer it does not mean\r\nthe Greeks of the army exclusively. There is, again, nothing in his use\r\nof it which associates it with a particular class of the army, either\r\nthe lower or the higher; but it appears to be essentially general,\r\ncomprehensive, and, I may add, likewise invariable in its meaning.\r\n\r\nStill less should we expect to find it, nor do we find it, connected\r\nwith the inhabitants of any particular part of the country: it has\r\nnot, like the Cadmean or Cephallenian name, a local habitation within\r\nGreece. Nor has it in itself any root, or any derivative, which would\r\nassociate it with any territory, as Αἰγιαλεῖς refers us to Αἰγίαλος, or\r\neven as Ἄρκαδες is related to Ἀρκαδίη.\r\n\r\nIts use in the Iliad is in exact harmony with that in the Odyssey: it\r\nis never associated with the history of the Greeks or any part of them:\r\nin short, there is no clear evidence of its existence or application\r\nbeyond the limits of the camp.\r\n\r\nNeither has it any thing related to the physical character of the\r\ncountry, or to any of the races known to have inhabited it, or to any\r\nemployment or habit of life, or to any deity. It floats before us like\r\nDelos on the Ægean, without any visible or discoverable root. And the\r\nonly question is, whether the slight positive evidence at our command\r\nis not so limited, and so hemmed in on all sides by negatives, as to\r\ndetermine the hypothesis that may be drawn from it to one particular\r\nform, by forbidding us to move, except in one particular direction.\r\n\r\nIt is quite plain that the Danaan name must have had some root, lying\r\nvery deep in the history or legends of Greece: since it would not have\r\nbeen possible for Homer, as a poet of the people, handling a subject\r\nthe most profoundly national, to describe the Greek army under any\r\nname, except one associated with some of the most splendid, or the most\r\nvenerable, traditions of the country.\r\n\r\n_Danaan name dynastic._\r\n\r\nIn one way alone could this name fulfil the required condition. If\r\nits root was not territorial, nor tribal, nor religious, it could\r\nonly be personal. Was there, then, a Danaus known to the early\r\nhistory of Greece, who founded a dynasty in its centre of power, at\r\na period anterior to the Hellenic history of the country, so as not\r\nto be in competition with the honours of that race? If so, then it\r\nis intelligible that the Greeks might be called Δαναοὶ by Homer. If\r\nthat dynasty had passed away, we can well understand why Δαναοὶ should\r\nnot be a name of contemporary Greeks as such: just as Καδμεῖοι was\r\nnot an admissible designation for contemporary Bœotians. Further, if\r\nit had never been an historical appellative at all, but was the mere\r\nreflection cast by the figure of a great primitive personage, and\r\nincorporated, for the Poet’s purpose, in a designation made national\r\nby him, then we can see how natural it was, that he should limit the\r\nword altogether to an heroic and martial sense; just as Cambrian\r\nfor Welshman, or Caledonian for Scotchman, or Gael for Highlander,\r\nor son of Albion for Englishman, would be an appellation naturally\r\nappropriated to romance, or war, or any strain impregnated with a\r\nstrong vein of imagery or passion, but yet would not be suitable for\r\nthe purposes of pure history.\r\n\r\nIn this inquiry concerning the Danaan name, we must, I think, carry\r\nalong with us, as a cardinal element in the case, that which we know\r\nfrom other sources respecting the manner in which Homer was wont to\r\nveil all traces of the entry from elsewhere of races, persons, or\r\ninfluences into Greece. It must never be forgotten, that, throughout\r\nthe whole of the poems, there is apparently not one single statement,\r\nmade to us with the intention of conveying information respecting\r\nthe colonization of Greece from abroad. It seems to be the Poet’s\r\nintention that we should assume all Greek manners, institutions, and\r\nraces, to have sprung out of the very soil: and it is only accidentally\r\nthat he imparts to us any information or suggestion on this subject,\r\nwhen he is in quest of some other purpose, and unawares lets fall a\r\ngleam of light upon some foreign settlement or immigration.\r\n\r\nAll this is conformable to the course of natural feeling. Shakespeare\r\nfound it worth his while to sing of Lear, but not of Hengist and Horsa;\r\nof the English in France, not of the Normans in England. And though\r\nDanish invasions have not robbed our great Alfred of his fame, yet for\r\na long time, in order to guard its brilliancy, it may have been that we\r\ncoloured in our own favour the military history of the period. Arrivals\r\nfrom abroad, in the early periods of the life of a nation, are usually\r\nthe conquests, in one form or another, of foreigners over natives: of\r\nwhat is strange to the soil over what is associated with it. It can\r\nhardly be, that such narratives should be popular. An abnormal instance\r\nto the contrary may be found in the fable, which deduced the Julian\r\nline in Rome from Æneas: but this was for poetry composed a thousand\r\nyears after the date of its narrative; composed when the line of\r\nnational continuity with those, whom Æneas was taken to have conquered,\r\nhad been completely broken; and composed for the ears of a court, when\r\nthe pulse of national life had become almost insensible. Even the\r\nprocess, by which Hellenes mastered Pelasgians, is nowhere professedly\r\nrelated by Homer; whose purpose it was to unite more closely the\r\nelements of the nation, and not to record that they had once been\r\nseparate.\r\n\r\n_Compared with the Cadmean._\r\n\r\nExcept in the one point, that the name Καδμεῖοι had had a clear and\r\nundeniable place in prior history, there is a marked analogy between\r\nthe modes in which Homer treats the Cadmean and the Danaan stories.\r\nIn each of the two cases, general tradition tells us of a foreigner,\r\nwho enters Greece and founds a dynasty. This dynasty, after acting\r\npowerfully on the destinies of the country for some generations, in\r\nthe course of time disappears, the name dying with it. All this,\r\nin the first of the two instances, we have seen to be sufficiently\r\nsupported by inference and suggestion from Homer. Yet Homer never\r\nmentions Cadmus, except as it were by chance, in the act of giving the\r\nextraction of Leucothee[625]; nor states that he came from abroad;\r\nnor that he founded a dynasty at all. He gives us Cadmus, father of\r\nLeucothee, and Cadmeans, and lets us make of them what we can. So here\r\nhe gives us Danaans, and not indeed a Danaus, but a Danae, who is\r\npresumably related to Danaus.\r\n\r\n2. In Iliad xiv., Jupiter renders an account of his passion for various\r\nwomen, all of them persons in the very highest positions; and among\r\nthese for Danae[626].\r\n\r\n            Δανάης καλλισφύρου Ἀκρισιώνης,\r\n    ἣ τέκε Περσῆα, πάντων ἀριδείκετον ἀνδρῶν.\r\n\r\n_The line of Danae._\r\n\r\nIn this passage we have Danae exhibited as the head of a line of\r\nsovereigns through Perseus, who occupied the most ancient and\r\nmost distinguished seat of power in Greece, that of the Eastern\r\nPeloponnesus. From her, indeed, the derivation of sovereignty is\r\nlocally continuous down to the time of Homer. Perseus is the father\r\nof Sthenelus[627], and Sthenelus of Eurystheus. Next to him, we find\r\nPelops in possession of the throne, with a new sceptre, betokening\r\na new sovereignty. That is to say, he was no longer a merely local\r\nsovereign, whose highest honour it was to be first in that class,\r\n_primus inter pares_; but he had also acquired an extensive supremacy,\r\nreaching beyond his own borders, or those of the Achaic Argos, and\r\nembracing all Greece, with a multitude of islands[628].\r\n\r\nSuch is the line of Danae downwards: beginning with a son, whose\r\npaternal extraction we shall consider hereafter[629]. And her epoch,\r\nas we shall see, is six generations before the Trojan war. For tracing\r\nher upwards, we have no means from Homer, except such as are afforded\r\nby the word Ἀκρισιώνη. The use of a patronymic which describes Danae\r\nas the daughter (most probably) of Acrisius, in some degree makes it\r\nlikely that Acrisius either was the brother of Danaus, or otherwise\r\ncollaterally related, rather than directly descended from him. For,\r\nhad Danae herself been descended from Danaus, it seems improbable\r\nthat she would have drawn her patronymic from the less distinguished\r\nAcrisius, unless Danaus was a very remote ancestor. But this is very\r\nimprobable: for seven generations before Troy form the utmost limit\r\nof Homer’s historical knowledge; and where all besides falls within\r\nthat line, it is improbable that there should be a single exception\r\nreaching greatly beyond it. And again, from the course of migration, it\r\nis likely that we should find his oldest traditions in Asia, and not\r\nin Europe. On the other hand, that Homer should stop short in tracing\r\nthe lineage onwards, just before he came to the foreign immigrant,\r\nis in exact conformity with what he has done in omitting to connect\r\nŒdipus and Epicaste[630] with Cadmus, or Pelops with Tantalus. In the\r\nformer of these two cases, the omission all the more cogently suggests\r\ndesign, because Epicaste is the only woman introduced in the Νεκυΐα\r\nwithout mention of her husband, among all those, eight in number, of\r\nwhose cases he gives us the detail. It is most probable, therefore,\r\nthat Homer meant the genealogy to stand as follows: and at the least,\r\nit must not be thought that the text of Homer gives countenance either\r\ndirectly or indirectly to those later fables, which throw back the\r\nfirst Greek dynasties into a very remote antiquity.\r\n\r\n  1. Danaus = Acrisius\r\n                 |\r\n            2. Danae\r\n            3. Perseus\r\n            4. Sthenelus\r\n            5. Eurystheus (= Hercules) = Pelops\r\n                           6. Atreus = Thyestes\r\n                           7. Agamemnon = Ægisthus.\r\n\r\n_Epoch of the dynasty._\r\n\r\nAccording to these presumptions, Danaus is contemporary with\r\nDardanus[631]: and also is just such a person as Homer’s poetic use of\r\nthe name Δαναοὶ would lead us to expect; one who came from abroad, and\r\nis on that account kept in majestic shadow; one who founded a throne,\r\nbut did not introduce a race: one who may have given his people the\r\nname of Δαναοὶ, as Cadmus gave that of Καδμεῖοι, for the time while\r\nhis dynasty was in power, but whose name disappeared, together with\r\nits sway. We have, it will be remembered in Homer, no Homeric legends\r\nof the period of the Danaids, so that we do not know whether the name\r\nΔαναοὶ was then in any degree national or not.\r\n\r\nAccording to the post-Homeric tradition, Danaus was an Egyptian[632],\r\nbrother of Ægyptus. He migrated into Greece, and became king of Argos.\r\nAcrisius and Prœtus were reputed to be his great-grandsons.\r\n\r\nIn Homer, too, we have an Acrisius and a Prœtus: but Prœtus is\r\ncontemporary with Bellerophon, two generations before the _Troica_, so\r\nthat he is later by four generations than Acrisius, and later by at\r\nleast four than Danaus.\r\n\r\nThe more recent tradition, contradicting Homer positively in this, as\r\nin so many instances, carries Prœtus back to the time of Acrisius, and\r\nthen, paying some respect to the interval between Prœtus and Danaus,\r\ngives compensation by thrusting Danaus himself three generations\r\nfurther back.\r\n\r\nOf the posterity of the Homeric Prœtus we hear nothing, and with him\r\nthe Danaid line, prolonged in a junior branch, may have expired.\r\nTradition places him on the throne of Tiryns. His holding a separate\r\nsovereignty in Argolis is not of itself in conflict with the Homeric\r\naccount of the Perseids, who reigned at Mycenæ; because we find in\r\nArgos itself a separate sovereignty under Diomed at the epoch of the\r\n_Troica_. But the terms used are peculiar. Prœtus ruled over Ἀργεῖοι;\r\n\r\n                   πολὺ φέρτερος ἦεν\r\n    Ἀργείων· Ζεὺς γάρ οἱ ὑπὸ σκηπτρῷ ἐδάμασσεν[633].\r\n\r\nThe account of Eurystheus in the Nineteenth Book may, however, imply\r\nthat he was king of all the Ἀργεῖοι: and at first sight there is some\r\nconflict here, because both Eurystheus and Prœtus may be said to\r\ndate two generations before the _Troica_. The solution is probably\r\nas follows. The passion of Antea, wife of Prœtus, for Bellerophon,\r\nsuggests that her husband was more advanced in life than Bellerophon,\r\nwhom, as the grandfather of Glaucus, we may take as justly representing\r\nin time the second generation before the war. On the other hand, as\r\nEurystheus was the contemporary of Hercules, and Hercules had a son,\r\nas well as grandsons in the war, we may assume Eurystheus to have been\r\njunior to the generation, as Prœtus was its senior; so that they need\r\nnot have been contemporary princes.\r\n\r\nThe historic place assigned to Danaus, either as we might fix it from\r\nHomer, or as the later tradition would determine it, keeps him clear\r\nof the earliest Hellic traditions in southern Greece. None of these\r\ncan well be carried back beyond Sisyphus; and Sisyphus stands at five\r\ngenerations before the war, while Danaus cannot be less than seven. Had\r\nHomer made Danaus synchronise with the earlier Hellic sovereignties, it\r\nwould have been, in my view, a presumption against his Egyptian origin,\r\nor his existence altogether. For an Egyptian stranger was little likely\r\nto attain to power, where Hellenes were already in the field: the more\r\nenergetic genius would subdue the less vigorous. The expulsion of the\r\nHellenic Bellerophon, and the plot against his life, may really have\r\nbeen connected with the political jealousies of the Danaids towards\r\nthe formidable new-comers of the Æolid stem: nor do I read the fable\r\nof Jupiter with Danae otherwise than as a veil, used to give dignity\r\nto the commencement of an Hellic sovereignty, which, in the person of\r\nPerseus, partly succeeded, partly supplanted, the Danaid throne.\r\n\r\nDanaus has been mentioned by Hesiod, the first among the later\r\nauthorities. This poet states, that he relieved Argos from drought: an\r\noperation which harmonises well with the tradition that brings him from\r\na country dependent on the irrigation of the Nile, as the conditions of\r\ncultivation there could not but lead at an early date to care in the\r\nmanagement of water. He likewise calls Perseus by the name of Δαναίδης,\r\nand also terms him the son of Danae[634].\r\n\r\nThe only point of connection between the Danaids and the Argive or\r\nArgeian name is, that Prœtus, the last of the Danaids, reigns over\r\nArgeians. But this is at a period when the Perseid house, which was\r\nevidently Hellenic, has already become the first in rank among the\r\nGreek thrones, and has given, as is probable, the Argeian name to the\r\npeople of Eastern Peloponnesus. The whole evidence, therefore, throws\r\nthe Danaan name, with all its incidents, back to a period anterior to\r\nthat of Argeians and of Achæans.\r\n\r\nBut if the Danai were thus before the Ἀργεῖοι and before the Ἀχαιοὶ,\r\nwhom did they follow?\r\n\r\n_Post-Homeric tradition._\r\n\r\nThe evidence of Æschylus in the Supplices supports the tradition\r\nwhich makes them immediately follow the Pelasgi[635], or which, more\r\nstrictly, represents their name as the first of those borne by the\r\nGreek nation after it had ceased to be simply Pelasgic.\r\n\r\nBy Euripides was conveyed a kindred tradition, that Danaus, having come\r\nto Argos, colonized the city of Inachus; and that the Peloponnesians,\r\npreviously called Pelasgiotes, were thereafter called Danai[636].\r\n\r\n    Πελασγιῶτας δ’ ὠνομασμένους, τὸ πρὶν\r\n    Δαναοὺς καλεῖσθαι νόμον ἔθηκ’ ἀν’ Ἑλλάδα.\r\n\r\nThese traditions, received through the tragedians, coincide with the\r\nevidence of the Homeric text. For this text, in the first place,\r\nclearly throws the Danaan line farther back than that of any of the\r\nHellic tribes. Secondly, by negative evidence, no where employing the\r\nDanaan name in the pre-Troic legends, he leaves us to infer that it\r\nmust have been the oldest, and the most remote from common use, of his\r\nthree great appellations. Thirdly, Homer supplies us with no other name\r\nwhich there is the smallest ground for inserting between the Danaans\r\nand the ancient Pelasgi, of whom we have found traces, direct and\r\nindirect, in so many places of the poems.\r\n\r\nThus, then, although we can plead little but conjecture from Homer with\r\nrespect to the person Danaus, we seem to be justified in concluding\r\nfrom his testimony, that the appellation was dynastic, that the dynasty\r\nwas pre-Hellenic, and that it stands in chronological order next to the\r\nPelasgic time.\r\n\r\nThe name Ἀργεῖοι is the next with which we have to deal: and this\r\nname, applicable to persons, is so evidently founded on the name\r\nἌργος, applicable to territory, that with this latter word we must of\r\nnecessity begin the investigation; just as in order to arrive at the\r\nmeaning of the term Hellenes, we were obliged to begin with Hellas.\r\n\r\n_Applications of the name Argos._\r\n\r\nAnd the word Ἄργος is so important, and as it were central, in the\r\ngeography of Homer, that we had better first consider what are the\r\nvarious forms of expression which Homer uses when he wants to express\r\nin words the entire territory of the Greek nation:\r\n\r\n1. We have already seen that he appears to use for this purpose the\r\ncombined force of the names Hellas and Argos;\r\n\r\n    ἀνδρὸς, τοῦ κλέος εὐρὺ καθ’ Ἑλλάδα καὶ μέσον Ἄργος[637].\r\n\r\n2. He employs other combinations for the like purpose. The first\r\nis that of Ἄργος, extended by the epithet πᾶν, and joined with the\r\nislands. These words taken together embrace the whole Empire of\r\nAgamemnon:\r\n\r\n    πολλῇσιν νήσοισι, καὶ Ἄργει παντὶ ἀνάσσειν[638].\r\n\r\n3. And again, with the proper name Ἀχαïὶς,\r\n\r\n    Ἄργος ἐς ἱππόβοτον, καὶ Ἀχαïίδα καλλιγύναικα[639].\r\n\r\nThis is spoken by the Trojan herald of the possible adjustment of the\r\nquarrel, upon which, he says, we shall dwell quietly in Troy, and\r\n_they_ will return to Argos and Achæis. By “they” he means all the\r\nGreeks, therefore the country to which they return means all Greece.\r\n\r\n4. It may be a question whether Ἄργος, in combination with μέσος,\r\nincludes the whole of Greece, as in the speech of Diomed to Glaucus:\r\n\r\n    τῷ νῦν σοι μὲν ἐγὼ ξεῖνος φίλος Ἄργεï μέσσῳ\r\n    εἰμὶ, σὺ δ’ ἐν Λυκίῃ[640].\r\n\r\n5. It is also a question, what is the geographical force of Argos, even\r\nwhen standing alone. It is manifestly wide in certain passages. Thus\r\nParis mentions the κτήματα,\r\n\r\n    ὅσσ’ ἀγόμην ἐξ Ἄργεος ἡμέτερον δῶ[641]:\r\n\r\nand Polydamas, speaking of the possible destruction of the Greek army,\r\n\r\n    νωνύμνους ἀπολέσθαι ἀπ’ Ἄργεος ἐνθάδ’ Ἀχαιούς[642].\r\n\r\na line repeated elsewhere. On the other hand, the word in some places\r\nhas undoubtedly a limited meaning only.\r\n\r\n6. Again, we find the word Ἀχαίïς γαῖα, used apparently with the\r\nintention of signifying the whole Greek country; as in the first Iliad\r\nby Nestor;\r\n\r\n    ὦ πόποι, ἢ μέγα πένθος Ἀχαίïδα γαῖα ἱκάνει[643].\r\n\r\n7. And we have the same word Ἀχαίïς without γαῖα, both in the Iliad and\r\nthe Odyssey.\r\n\r\nFor instance, when Nestor and Ulysses were collecting the Greek forces,\r\nthey were\r\n\r\n    λαὸν ἀγείροντες κατ’ Ἀχαίïδα πουλυβότειραν[644].\r\n\r\nAnd Ulysses, addressing his mother in the Shades beneath, says,\r\n\r\n    οὐ γάρ πω σχέδον ἦλθον Ἀχαίïδος, οὐδέ πω ἀμῆς\r\n    γῆς ἐπέβην[645].\r\n\r\nTo proceed first with what is most clear, I think it may be taken\r\nfor certain that Ἀχαίïς, with or without the affix γαῖα or αἶα[646],\r\nmeans nothing less than the whole of Greece in the passages where\r\nHomer uses this appellative alone. One passage, indeed, taken alone,\r\naffords decisive proof for itself that even the islands are included.\r\nTelemachus[647] thus describes his mother as unrivalled in Greece:\r\n\r\n    οἵη νῦν οὐκ ἔστι γύνη κατ’ Ἀχαίïδα γαῖαν\r\n    οὔτε Πύλου ἱερῆς, οὔτ’ Ἄργεος, οὔτε Μυκήνης,\r\n    οὔτ’ αὐτῆς Ἰθάκης, οὔτ’ ἠπείροιο μελαίνης.\r\n\r\nFor here are clearly enumerated as among the parts of Ἀχαίïς, several\r\nPeloponnesian states, the island of Ithaca, and the continent,\r\nevidently meaning that to the North of the Corinthian gulf.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it may remain true that, though commonly meaning Greece at\r\nlarge, Ἀχαίïς may still have a more special connection with the South,\r\nas the whole of this island is called Britain, whereas the name has\r\nbeen derived especially from its southern inhabitants.\r\n\r\nBut in the passages numbered (1) and (3) we find the whole of Greece\r\ndesignated by the use, not of one, but of two expressions: in the first\r\ncase they are,\r\n\r\n  1. Ἕλλας.\r\n  2. μέσον Ἄργος.\r\n\r\nIn the second they are,\r\n\r\n  1. Ἄργος.\r\n  2. Ἀχαίïς.\r\n\r\nAnd with these we may compare the expression, evidently meant to cover\r\nall the Greeks, in Il. ii. 530, under the names\r\n\r\n  1. Πανέλληνες.\r\n  2. Ἀχαιοί.\r\n\r\nNow there are here three ways in which the words may be used so as to\r\nconvey their joint sense, which I assume to be that of Greece _entire_:\r\nviz.\r\n\r\n1. That each word should cover a part, the two parts together making up\r\nthe whole, _i.e._ that the words should be used distributively.\r\n\r\n2. That each should cover the whole, and that the words should be used\r\ncumulatively.\r\n\r\n3. That one of the words should apply to a part of Greece only, and\r\nshould be overlapped as it were by the other, that other meaning the\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nNow as Ἀχαίïς uniformly means all Greece in eight passages where it\r\nstands alone, this will naturally govern its sense in the two passages,\r\nwhere it is joined copulatively with Ἄργος. We shall also hereafter\r\nsee the local use of the Ἀχαιοὶ so diffused, that it would hardly be\r\npossible to suppose any other meaning. Thus, then, we have one point\r\nfixed, from which to operate upon others.\r\n\r\nBut what does the Ἄργος ἱππόβοτον mean?\r\n\r\nIt is demonstrable that in Homer the word Ἄργος has several meanings.\r\n\r\n1. It is a city, as in Il. iv. 51,\r\n\r\n    ἤτοι ἐμοὶ τρεῖς μὲν πολὺ φίλταται εἰσὶ πόληες\r\n    Ἄργος τε, Σπάρτη τε, καὶ εὐρυάγυια Μυκήνη.\r\n    τὰς διαπέρσαι κ.τ.λ.\r\n\r\n2. It is a limited territory, probably such as was afterwards the State\r\nof Argolis. For when Telemachus is quitting Sparta, Theoclymenus joins\r\nhim[648], φεύγων ἐξ Ἄργεος. And again, when Melampus quitted Pylos, he\r\ncame to Argos:\r\n\r\n                    ὁ δ’ ἄλλων ἵκετο δῆμον\r\n    Ἄργος ἐς ἱππόβοτον[649].\r\n\r\nThe first proves that Sparta was not included in the geographical name\r\nἌργος: the second proves the same of Pylos: and this too is the Ἄργος\r\nἱππόβοτον.\r\n\r\nThe same phrase is used in Od. iii. 263, of Ægisthus, who endeavours to\r\ncorrupt Clytemnestra,\r\n\r\n    μυχῷ Ἄργεος ἱπποβότοιο.\r\n\r\nHere Mycenæ is plainly meant by the μυχὸς, and the Ἄργος ἱππόβοτον is\r\nArgolis, or something like it.\r\n\r\nThis district, including Mycenæ, was the head quarter of the Greek\r\npower. Now we find that the whole dominion of Priam was named Τροίη,\r\nwhile including many cities and much territory, and the name Τροίη\r\nwas also sometimes applied to the capital, of which the proper name\r\nwas Ilion. So Venezia at the present day means both a city and a\r\nterritory, even though the city is outside the territory; the only\r\ndistinction lying in the use or non-use of the article. Therefore it\r\nwas sufficiently natural, that the Trojan herald should name the whole\r\nfrom the most excellent part, and so identify them: and on the other\r\nhand, it would not be otherwise than natural, were he to name the\r\nmost excellent part, and likewise to name the whole, without verbally\r\ndistinguishing them.\r\n\r\nSo that in Il. iii. 75, 258, the phrase Ἄργος ἐς ἱππόβοτον, according\r\nto what has preceded, may either mean,\r\n\r\n1. The part of the Peloponnesus containing Argos and Mycenæ as its\r\nhead quarter, (and then the line must be interpreted in the third of\r\nthe modes above pointed out; as we might now say, ‘we visited Rome and\r\nItaly.’)\r\n\r\n2. Or it may mean the whole of Greece, by transfer from its capital\r\npart, and then the line must be interpreted in the second mode, as\r\nmight now be said, ‘to our Green Erin, our Ireland mother of the brave.’\r\n\r\nThe English ‘and’ would indeed mar the sense: but the Greek καὶ is much\r\nmore elastic, and may be equivalent to the Italian _ossia_, or to the\r\nsign =.\r\n\r\nI doubt if there be any passage in Homer where the word Argos stands\r\nalone, or with a characteristic epithet such as ἱππόβοτον, and where\r\nit requires any other sense than one of the three just given--the\r\ncity--the north east of Peloponnesus--and (by metonymy) all Greece.\r\n\r\nWhen Nestor (Il. ii. 348) denounces those Greeks who should think of\r\nreturning home before the mind of Jupiter is known, and calls returning\r\nἌργοσδε ἰέναι, it seems indisputable that we must construe Ἄργος Greece.\r\n\r\nWhen Paris says he brought the κτήματα from Argos, the most natural\r\nconstruction is, as the place was Sparta, and therefore not Argos in\r\nthe narrow sense, from which he took them, that he means by Argos to\r\nsignify Greece.\r\n\r\nWhen Sisyphus dwells at Ephyre, μυχῷ Ἄργεος ἱπποβότοιο, the word means\r\nthe north eastern district Peloponnesus[650].\r\n\r\nThe word Ἄργος in the Catalogue (ii. 559) most probably means the city\r\nonly.\r\n\r\nAs it is plain that in some passages it cannot mean the Peloponnesus,\r\nand as that meaning does not appear to be supported by superior\r\nprobability in any place, such a meaning ought not to be admitted.\r\n\r\n_Achaic and Iasian Argos._\r\n\r\nIt is another question how we ought to construe the phrases μέσον\r\nἌργος--Ἀχαιïκὸν Ἄργος, used four times--and Ἴασον Ἄργος.\r\n\r\nThe two latter are evidently analogous to Πελασγικὸν Ἄργος, which we\r\nhave already found to mean Thessaly.\r\n\r\nOf the four passages where we read the phrase Ἀχαιïκὸν Ἄργος, the\r\ntwo first[651] relate to the return of Agamemnon and the Greeks, and\r\nappear to admit therefore either of the limited sense of a portion of\r\nPeloponnesus as the most eminent part, or of the extended one of all\r\nGreece, better than of the intermediate one of Peloponnesus itself,\r\nwith which neither Agamemnon, nor the whole body of the Greeks, had\r\nany separate and defined relation, as they had with the dominions of\r\nAgamemnon in the capacity of their supreme Chief, and perhaps with\r\nthose of the Pelopid family jointly, so as to include Menelaus.\r\n\r\nIn the third case it is used of Juno, as she goes to hasten the birth\r\nof Eurystheus[652],\r\n\r\n    καρπαλίμως δ’ ἵκετ’ Ἄργος Ἀχαιïκὸν, ἔνθ’ ἄρα ᾔδη\r\n    ἰφθίμην ἄλοχον Σθενέλου Περσηïάδαο.\r\n\r\nThis passage evidently admits the sense of the city, or a limited\r\ndistrict, better than that of the Peloponnesus at large. Indeed, as\r\nthe seat of the Perseid dominion is evidently intended, and as that\r\ndominion did not reach over all Peloponnesus, we may say that this\r\ncould not be the meaning of the words.\r\n\r\nBut the fourth passage requires a larger signification for this phrase.\r\nIt is the question of Telemachus, asking where Menelaus had been during\r\nall the time that Ægisthus was about his crime[653];\r\n\r\n    ποῦ Μενέλαος ἔην;\r\n    ἢ οὐκ Ἄργεος ἦεν Ἀχαιïκοῦ, ἀλλὰ πῇ ἄλλῃ\r\n    πλάζετ’ ἐπ’ ἀνθρώπους;\r\n\r\nThis seems clearly to include Sparta in Achaic Argos; and, this\r\nbeing so, no meaning is so suitable to it in this place as Eastern\r\nPeloponnesus. This construction is also eminently suitable to the\r\nrelation between Eastern Peloponnesus and the Achæan power, which had\r\nits central seat there.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly Strabo treats Ἀχαιïκὸν Ἄργος as meaning the whole of\r\nPeloponnesus (viii. 5. p. 365, ibid. 6. p. 369), but the argument from\r\nHomer’s text seems to be against him: and even he admits from Od. iii.\r\n249, that the term applied also to Laconia in particular: ἀλλὰ καὶ\r\nἰδίως τὴν Λακωνικὴν οὕτω προσαγορευθῆναι[654].\r\n\r\nAs then it appears that the sense of Eastern Peloponnesus will suit the\r\nphrase Ἄργος Ἀχαιïκὸν in all the four passages where it is employed,\r\nwhile the more extended meaning of the whole Peloponnesus is required\r\nby none, and could only be even admissible in one (Od. iii. 249), we\r\nmay conclude that Eastern Peloponnesus is the proper meaning of the\r\nphrase.\r\n\r\n_Iasian Argos._\r\n\r\nWe now come to Ἴασον Ἄργος.\r\n\r\nIn Od. xviii. 245, Eurymachus the Suitor, in paying a compliment to the\r\nbeauty of Penelope, says to her, you would have more suitors than you\r\nhave,\r\n\r\n    εἰ παντές σε ἴδοιεν ἀν’ Ἴασον Ἄργος Ἀχαιοί.\r\n\r\nNow it must first be admitted, that this does not refer to any country\r\nout of the Peloponnesus. For in the first place, that was the most\r\ndistinguished part of the country, and the chief Achæan seat; so that\r\nthe intention of this speech therefore most naturally bears upon it.\r\nBut also we have nothing in Homer to connect any local use of the word\r\nἌργος with Middle Greece.\r\n\r\nBut if Eurymachus means nothing to the North of Peloponnesus, it is\r\nagain most probable that he refers to that part of Peloponnesus with\r\nwhich Ithaca had most intercourse, where lay its relations of business,\r\nand of hospitality. Now this part was Western Peloponnesus, as we see\r\nfrom the journey of Ulysses to Ephyre (Od. i. 260); from the journey\r\nof Telemachus which, as it were, spontaneously takes that direction;\r\nfrom the course of public transactions implied in his speech (Od. iii.\r\n82, cf. 72); from the χρεῖος, which Ulysses went to recover in Messene\r\n(Od. xxi. 15); from Nestor’s being the person to visit Ithaca in the\r\nmatter of the great Trojan quarrel; and from the apprehension felt by\r\nthe party of the Suitors, that Ulysses would forthwith repair to Elis,\r\nor to Pylos for aid. (Od. xxiv. 431.)\r\n\r\nJust so the relations of Crete were with Eastern Peloponnesus; and\r\ntherefore Helen at Troy recognises Idomeneus, because she has often\r\nseen him in Sparta. And this, I may observe in passing, is probably\r\nthe reason why Ulysses, in the fictitious accounts which he gives\r\nof himself in Ithaca, is so fond of making himself a Cretan, namely\r\nthat he may avoid any risk of detection, by placing his own proper\r\nwhereabout at a distance beyond the ordinary range of intercourse.\r\n\r\nNor are we wholly without information from Homer on the subject of\r\nthe original Iasus himself, from whom the name appears to be derived;\r\nand whose name we find still subsisting in Attica at the time of the\r\n_Troica_[655].\r\n\r\nFor a passage in the Eleventh Odyssey informs us that Amphion, son\r\nof Iasus[656], was a powerful prince in Minyeian Orchomenus: that\r\nhis youngest daughter, the beautiful Chloris, was queen of Pylos: and\r\nthat Neleus, marrying her, founded there the dynasty of the Neleids.\r\nThus through Pylos we connect a powerful Iasid family with Western\r\nPeloponnesus, possibly five generations before the Trojan war, and at a\r\ntime when we find from Homer that the Danaids or Perseus must have been\r\nreigning in Eastern Peloponnesus. This seems enough to justify putting\r\nthe sense of Western Peloponnesus upon the phrase Ἴασον Ἄργος in the\r\nspeech of Eurymachus.\r\n\r\nWe may justly inquire whether it is so certain, as seems to be taken\r\nfor granted, that the Minyeian Orchomenus, where Amphion reigned, was\r\nthe Orchomenus of Bœotia. For his daughter Chloris was sovereign of\r\nPylos, and we must suppose that sovereignty to have been not acquired\r\nby herself, but inherited from her father. Now it is very improbable\r\nthat Amphion could have been sovereign at the same time of Pylos and\r\nof the northern Orchomenos: between which intervened an Æolid family\r\nsettled at the Isthmus, another race of Hellenic chiefs, the line\r\nof Portheus, in Ætolia, and perhaps also the dynasty of Cadmus in\r\nBœotia. We have no instance in Homer of the possession by the same\r\nprince of territories not continuous. Now there was there a river\r\nMinyeius, between Pylos and Elis; in Arcadia as well as in Bœotia there\r\nwas an Orchomenos at the period of Homer; it seems then probable,\r\nthat the name of that town should be combined with the Minyeian name\r\nin Peloponnesus as well as in Bœotia. If it were so, the political\r\nconnection with Pylos is natural, and the application of the Iasian\r\nname to Western Peloponnesus becomes still more easy of explication.\r\nBut even though the Orchomenos here named be Bœotian, the case remains\r\nsufficiently clear. For it was once, or formerly (τότε) that Amphion\r\nreigned in Orchomenus; and the meaning may well be, that having in\r\nearlier life reigned there, he had afterwards accompanied the southward\r\nmovement of the time, perhaps being expelled from his fat soil; and\r\nthat he established, or re-established the connection between Western\r\nPeloponnesus and the Iasian name.\r\n\r\nLastly, the place μέσον Ἄργος seems to be equivalent to the English\r\nexpression, ‘through the breadth of Argos,’ or _all over_ Argos;\r\nand though we may think that Ἄργος alone means one side of the\r\nPeloponnesus, μέσον Ἄργος may very well mean the whole. In the speech\r\nof Diomed[657] to Glaucus, it cannot mean less than this: on the other\r\nhand, from its being the counterpart of Lycia, it may perhaps not\r\nless probably signify the whole of settled Greece, and thus be the\r\nequivalent of πᾶν Ἄργος in Il. ii. 108. But the more convenient sense\r\nfor Od. xv. 80 is plainly the Peloponnesus, because then it squares\r\nprecisely with Hellas in the same passage, and the two together make\r\nup the whole of Greece. But without disturbing the signification of\r\nthe word Hellas, as meaning Northern and Middle Greece, we might still\r\ngive to μέσον Argos the force of ‘all Greece.’ The words of Menelaus\r\nwould then stand as if an inhabitant of London said to his friend a\r\nforeigner, ‘I will take you through Scotland and all Britain.’ It is\r\ndifficult, however, to decide absolutely between these two senses of\r\nμέσον Ἄργος. What we see plainly is, that the word Ἄργος had taken\r\nthe deepest root, and a very wide range, in connection with Greek\r\nsettlements, and with such settlements only.\r\n\r\nAnd now with respect to the line so much criticised,\r\n\r\n    ἐγχείῃ δ’ ἐκέκαστο Πανέλληνας καὶ Ἀχαιούς[658].\r\n\r\nThe word Πανέλληνες may, we have seen, either mean the tribes of Greece\r\nbeyond the Isthmus, or those of all Greece: in which latter and more\r\nlikely sense it is coextensive with Ἀχαιοί. I here finally touch upon\r\nthis verse along with those properly geographical, on account of the\r\nimportant combination which it involves.\r\n\r\n_The Apian land._\r\n\r\nWe find in Il. i. 270, iii. 49, and in Od. vii. 25, xvi. 18, the\r\nexpression ἀπίη γαίη, which some of the grammarians, and the common\r\nopinion mentioned by Strabo[659], have explained to mean the\r\nPeloponnesus, while modern scholars render it simply distant[660]. In\r\nthe two passages of the Iliad, the former construction is certainly\r\nmore suitable: and the combination with τηλόθεν in Il. i. 270, is\r\ntautological, flat, and un-Homeric, if ἀπίη mean merely distant. In\r\nOd. xvi. 18 either sense will serve the passage. In Od. vii. 25 (when\r\nwe again have τηλόθεν) Ulysses states himself to have come ἐξ ἀπίης\r\nγαίης. As he had not come from Peloponnesus, it is assumed that this\r\nis not the meaning. I question the reasoning. Ulysses everywhere,\r\nwhen questioned, shows an immense fertility in fiction about himself:\r\nin every case, however, carefully reporting himself to be come from\r\na distant spot. I see no reason therefore why we should not construe\r\nἈπίη γαῖα to mean the Peloponnesus; in conformity with the tradition\r\nwhich Æschylus[661] reports concerning Apis, and with the undoubted\r\nusage of the tragedians. As I interpret the Outer or Romance-geography\r\nof the Odyssey, the Peloponnesus would be understood by the Phæacians\r\nof Homer to be extremely remote from their country. The difference of\r\nquantity is no sufficient reason against this construction. Plainly\r\nἈπίη γαίη, if it be a proper name at all, means the whole Peloponnesus,\r\nand not a part of it, for Nestor in Il. i. 270 uses it so as to include\r\nthe Western side, and Hector, Il. iii. 49, so as to include the Eastern.\r\n\r\n_Geographical definitions._\r\n\r\nI will now sum up the conclusions to which this inquiry has brought\r\nus, either by certain or by probable evidence, with respect to Homer’s\r\ngeographical nomenclature for Greece at large, and for its principal\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\n  1. Ἀχαïὶς       }\r\n     Ἀχαïὶς γαῖα  }  invariably mean the whole of Greece.\r\n     Ἀχαιῒς αἶα   }\r\n\r\n2. Ἄργος either alone, or with epithets other than those which concern\r\ngeographical extension, means\r\n\r\n  (1) The city only, as in Il. iv. 52, and probably in Il. ii. 559.\r\n\r\n  (2) The immediate dominions of Agamemnon in the north and north-east\r\n  of Peloponnesus, as in Od. iii. 263.\r\n\r\n  But it is possible, though by no means certain, that Ἄργος in this\r\n  sense should be held to include the whole Pelopid dominions, which\r\n  were looked upon as having a certain political unity, and thus to be\r\n  the equivalent of Ἄργος Ἀχαιïκόν.\r\n\r\n  (3) By metonymy from this supreme and metropolitan quarter of Greece,\r\n  it means the whole country.\r\n\r\n3. The phrase πᾶν Ἄργος in Il. ii. 108 means the whole of Continental\r\nGreece.\r\n\r\n4. The phrase μέσον Ἄργος means most probably the whole of Greece, or\r\nGreece at large; possibly the Peloponnesus only.\r\n\r\n5. Πελασγικὸν Ἄργος is Thessaly, from Macedonia to Œta.\r\n\r\n6. Ἀχαιïκὸν Ἄργος means the Pelopid dominions of the Troic time, or in\r\ngeneral words, Eastern Peloponnesus.\r\n\r\n7. Ἴασον Ἄργος means Western Peloponnesus.\r\n\r\n8. The word Ἕλλας means\r\n\r\n  (1) probably a portion of the dominions of Achilles, as in Il. ii.\r\n  683, ix. 395;\r\n\r\n  (2) certainly the country outside them to the southward of Phthia,\r\n  down to the Isthmus of Corinth, and probably reaching northward\r\n  through the rest of Thessaly: Il. ix. 447 and elsewhere;\r\n\r\n  (3) it is possible that Ἕλλας may mean all Greece in Od. i. 344, and\r\n  xv. 80; but more likely that the sense is the same as in (2).\r\n\r\n9. The phrase Ἀπίη γαίη most probably, though not certainly, means the\r\nentire Peloponnesus.\r\n\r\nWhat then was this name Ἄργος, which Homer uses so much more\r\nfrequently, and with so much more elasticity and diversity of sense,\r\nthan any other territorial name whatever?\r\n\r\nIn the first place let us remark how rarely it is used for a city; in\r\nthe strict sense of the word, we cannot be said to find it more than\r\nonce. Its proper meaning is evidently a tract of country.\r\n\r\nFrom this it is limited to the city to which the tract of country\r\nbelonged: or it is extended to the country at large, of which the\r\nparticular tract was the capital or governing part. Both these\r\nsignifications are what are termed improper: the latter is also\r\npolitical, and has no relation to race, or to an eponymist, or to any\r\nphysical features of soil or scenery, whether the word Ἄργος may have\r\nhad such reference or not, when used in its original, proper, and usual\r\napplication, to mean a district.\r\n\r\nAs previously with populations, let us now set out the various\r\ndescriptions of source, to which the Homeric names of countries and\r\nplaces owe their origin.\r\n\r\nThey appear to be derived either\r\n\r\n1. From an individual eponymist, as Ithaca from Ithacus, Od. xvii. 207;\r\nDardania from Dardanus, Il. xx. 216; Ascanie from Ascanius, Il. ii.\r\n863; while we see the intermediate stage of the process in the name\r\nἈπίη, joined with γαῖα, supposed to indicate the Peloponnesus, and to\r\nbe derived from Apis.\r\n\r\n2. From a race in occupation: as in the case of Ἀχαïὶς γαῖα and Ἀχαïὶς\r\nsimply, from the Achæans; Ἕλλας from the Ἕλλοι; Κρήτη or Κρηταὶ (Od.\r\nxiv. 199) from the Κρῆτες.\r\n\r\n3. From its physical features or circumstances directly, such as\r\nΑἰγίαλος from being a narrow strip along the shore of the Corinthian\r\ngulf, between the mountains and the sea: there is also a town Αἰγίαλος\r\nof the Paphlagonians, Il. ii. 855. Probably we may add Εὔβοια, Eubœa,\r\nfrom the adaptation of that fertile island to tillage, which afterwards\r\nmade it the granary of Athens.\r\n\r\n4. From some race occupying it: and in the cases where that race has\r\nbeen named from any feature of the country, then, not directly but\r\nderivatively, from the country itself.\r\n\r\nFor instance, Θρῄκη from Θρῇκες, Thracians, which word again must come\r\nfrom a common root with τρᾶχυς. The name Τρηχῖν has obviously a similar\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nSo again in the later Greek we find the old Αἰγίαλος named Αἰγιάλεια\r\nfrom the intermediate formation Αἰγιαλεῖς: and perhaps Ἄργολις from\r\nthe Ἀργεῖοι, who inhabited it, and took their name from Ἄργος.\r\n\r\nAnd so in Homer we have Φθίη; from that apparently comes Φθῖοι, and\r\nfrom this again, in the later Greek, Phthiotis.\r\n\r\nSuch then are the ordinary sources, as far as we know, of the\r\nterritorial names of Homer.\r\n\r\nThe three aids which we have for judging of the meaning of the name\r\nἌργος are, the Homeric text, etymology, and the later tradition.\r\n\r\n_Etymology of the word Argos._\r\n\r\nNone of these in any manner connect the name Ἄργος either with\r\nan eponymist, or with a race of inhabitants, either mediately or\r\nimmediately, as its root. We can only therefore look for its origin\r\nin something related to the physical features of the country, or\r\ncountries, to which it was applied.\r\n\r\nThe word ἄργος itself is frequently found in Homer otherwise than as a\r\nproper name. It is used as an adjective in the following combinations:\r\n\r\n1. κύνες ἀργοὶ Il. i. 50.\r\n\r\n2. βόες ἀργοὶ Il. xxiii. 30.\r\n\r\n3. ἀργὴν χῆνα Od. xv. 161.\r\n\r\nSo also we have the compounds ἀργὴς (κέραυνος) ἀργικέραυνος, ἀργεστὴς\r\n(Νότος), ἀργενναὶ (ὀΐες, ὀθόναι), ἀργινόεις (Κάμειρος), ἀργιόδοντες\r\n(ὕες), ἀργιπόδες (κύνες), Ποδάργης (horse of Achilles).\r\n\r\nAnd it is usual to give to the word ἀργὸς[662] in these several forms\r\nthe several senses of\r\n\r\n1. Swift, as in swift dogs, swift thunderbolt.\r\n\r\n2. White, as in white goose, white (chalky) Cameirus.\r\n\r\n3. Sleek, shining, as in sleek oxen, with glistening coats.\r\n\r\nIt is said truly, that what is swift in motion gives an appearance\r\nof shining: and what shines is in some degree akin to whiteness.\r\nBut it is neither easy to say, in this view of the matter, which is\r\nthe primary, and which the secondary, meaning of the word, nor what\r\nis its etymology. Nor does it show the slightest resemblance to the\r\nlocal name Ἄργος, which, from the variety of its applications, apart\r\nfrom any question of race or political connection, must have had some\r\netymological signification.\r\n\r\nNor, as regards the βόες ἀργοὶ in particular, is it very easy to\r\nbelieve in the sleekness of the oxen in Homer’s time, (this seems to\r\nbe rather an idea borrowed from the processes and experience of modern\r\ntimes,) or of the camp oxen of any time. Nor is the matter mended by\r\ntwo forced attempts, one to construe βόες ἀργοὶ as oxen having white\r\nfat within them, or again, as slow oxen. From these sources, then, we\r\ncan at present obtain no light.\r\n\r\nNow I submit that the just signification of the proper name Ἄργος is\r\nto be found by considering it as akin to the word ἔργον, which plainly\r\nappears in Homer to have agricultural labours for its primary object.\r\nAnd it seems pretty clear, that by the transposition of letters which\r\nso commonly occurs in popular speech, especially during the infant\r\nstate of languages, the word ἄγρος, ‘a field,’ is no more than a form\r\nof Ἄργος.\r\n\r\nK. O. Müller, as we have seen, considers that Ἄργος with the ancients\r\nmeans a plain[663]: I would add a plain, not as being a flat surface,\r\nbut as being formed of cultivable ground, or else it means a\r\nsettlement formed upon such ground.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the word _plain_ as applied to Greece, we use it\r\nrelatively, not as it would be employed in reference to Russia or\r\nHungary, but as meaning the broader levels between the hills, and\r\ncommonly towards the sea: such as those valleys of Scotland which are\r\ncalled _carses_, or those called _straths_.\r\n\r\nNow in the first place I know no other meaning of the word Ἄργος which\r\nwill suit its various uses in Homer as Pelasgic Argos, Achaic Argos,\r\nIasian Argos. What is the one common physical feature of the several\r\nregions that accounts for the common factor in these three compound\r\nexpressions, if it be not that of plain, that is to say, cultivable,\r\nand cultivated, or settled country?\r\n\r\nAgain, look at the relation of Ἄργος to Ἀργεῖοι. What except a physical\r\nand geographical meaning, still adhering to the word, and holding\r\nit somewhat short of the mature and familiar use of a proper name,\r\ncan account for the fact that we have in the history and geography\r\nof Greece so many cases of an Argos, without Argives, that is local\r\nor provincial Argives, belonging to it? Achaic Argos indeed has\r\nἈργεῖοι belonging to it, but Pelasgic and Iasian Argos have none.\r\nJust so we might speak of the Highlands of Saxony, or of the Lowlands\r\nof Switzerland; but the inhabitants of the first are not known as\r\nHighlanders, nor those of the latter as Lowlanders[664].\r\n\r\nI believe there are no phrases, which more nearly translate the words\r\nἌργος and Ἀργεῖοι, than Lowlands and Lowlanders respectively. For\r\nthe word Lowlands means land not only lying low, but both lying low,\r\nand also being favourable for cultivation: and these ideas more truly\r\nrepresent the land fitted for the sort of settlement called Ἄργος, than\r\nthe mere idea of level plains.\r\n\r\nIf this be the idea of the word Argos, we see the propriety of its\r\napplication to the city of Argos and its district. For this city stood,\r\nas a city of the town and more open country, in a certain opposition to\r\nMycenæ, which nestled among the hills; and which bore geographically\r\nmuch the same relation to Argos, as Dardania to Ilion. It afterwards\r\nfell also into the same political analogy.\r\n\r\nIn the phrase Ἀχαιïκὸν Ἄργος, Homer deals with a case where, as it is\r\nsometimes applied without an epithet, Ἄργος may justly be called a\r\nproper name, like the European _Pays-bas_; but there is no evidence of\r\nthis in his ‘Pelasgic Argos,’ and ‘Iasian Argos,’ and it seems likely\r\nthat he rather intends in those phrases to employ the term Argos as a\r\nword simply descriptive, and to speak of the Pelasgian Lowlands, and\r\nthe Iasian Lowlands. The difference of sense is just that which we\r\nshould indicate in English by the absence of the capital letter.\r\n\r\nThere is evidence that the name had not exhausted its elasticity even\r\nafter Homer’s time. In later ages we find an Argos of Orestis in\r\nMacedonia; an Argos of Amphilochia in Western Greece; an Argos near\r\nLarissa in Thessaly[665], and other cases more remote. Nothing but a\r\ngeographical force still adhering to the word will account for this\r\nextension.\r\n\r\nThe same is the inference to be drawn from the epithets and\r\nquasi-epithets, or descriptive phrases, applied to it by Homer.\r\nWith the exception of one passage, where he gives it the political\r\nepithet[666] κλυτὸν, they are all physical; being ἱππόβοτον,\r\nπολυδίψιον, πολύπυρον, and οὖθαρ ἀρούρης. Of these four epithets, the\r\nfirst is in Homer peculiarly connected with the specific form and\r\ncharacter of the country: accordingly, while it is the standing epithet\r\nof Argos, being used with it eleven times out of only fifteen in which\r\nthe word has any epithet or quasi-epithet attached to it, it is never\r\nfound with Achæis, or with Hellas. And the proof of its physically\r\ndescriptive character lies in the passage where Telemachus gives to\r\nMenelaus an account of Ithaca;\r\n\r\n    ἐν δ’ Ἰθάκῃ οὔτ’ ἀρ’ δρόμοι εὔρεες, οὔτε τι λείμων·\r\n    αἰγίβοτος, καὶ μᾶλλον ἐπήρατος ἱπποβότοιο[667].\r\n\r\nThe ἱππόβοτος of Homer, again, does not point merely to fertility, but\r\nalso to labour and its results; not merely to pasture, but also to\r\ngrain, for the horses of Homer are fed on this as well as on herbage,\r\n\r\n    κρῖ λευκὸν ἐρεπτόμενοι καὶ ὀλεύρας[668].\r\n\r\nNow, in referring the word Ἄργος to a common root and significancy with\r\nἔργον, we are not bound to hold that it attains its initial vowel by\r\njunction with the particle ἀ used in its intensive sense. For we have\r\nthe word, and also its derivatives, in this form, coming down to us\r\nfrom the old Greek. Among the four tribes of Attica which subsisted\r\nuntil the time of Cleisthenes[669], one was that of the Ἄργαδες or\r\nhusbandmen: and in the Elian inscription supposed to date about the\r\nFortieth Olympiad[670], or more than 600 years B. C., we have the very\r\nword ἔργον in the form ἄργον, with the digamma, in a passage which I\r\ncopy,\r\n\r\n  ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ\r\n\r\nThis inscription, says the Article in the _Museum Criticum_, is of\r\nolder date than any other which has either been brought in copy from\r\nGreece, or is to be found on the marbles. The matter of it is a public\r\ntreaty, between the Elians and some of their neighbours, concluded for\r\nan hundred years.\r\n\r\nAnother good example of the interchange of the vowels α and ε is in\r\nthe word ἀρόω, which it is obvious to derive from ἔρα, the earth. In\r\nthe Latin we see both forms preserved, the one in _aro_ to plough, the\r\nother in _sero_ to sow. And this latter suggests the derivation of the\r\nGreek σπείρω from a similar source.\r\n\r\nIf then the meaning of Ἄργος be an agricultural settlement, and its\r\nroot the same with that of ἔργον, we need not now discuss at large\r\nwhether that root be the old word ἔρα or terra, which however appears\r\nto be probable, and which accounts both for the especial reference\r\nof the word ἔργον in Homer to tillage, the oldest industry, and for\r\nthe subsequent extension of its meaning to labour and its results in\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\n_The etymology tested by kindred words._\r\n\r\nNow, having this view of the words Ἄργος and ἔργον, we shall find, in\r\nthe fundamental idea of labour itself, a meaning which will furnish\r\na basis for the Homeric adjective, and for all its compounds in all\r\ntheir varied applications. That idea is always in relation with what is\r\nearnest, and (so to speak) strengthful; sometimes this takes the form\r\nof keenness, and then comes in the idea of swiftness in conjunction\r\nwith labour: sometimes, again, it takes the form of patience, and then\r\nlabour suggests slowness. The labour of a dog is swift, that of an ox\r\nis patient: hence the κύνες ἄργοι are laborious dogs, therefore swift;\r\nand hence too the βόες ἄργοι are laborious oxen, therefore slow; the\r\noffice of the one being to cover space, and of the other to overcome\r\nresistance. We may bring the two senses near without any loss in either\r\ncase, by calling the oxen sturdy or sedulous, and the dogs strenuous or\r\nkeen.\r\n\r\nThe third sense of whiteness legitimately attaches to the effect of\r\nrapid motion upon the eye.\r\n\r\nThe sense of sleekness does not appear to be required in Homer: but it\r\nmay be a derivative from that of whiteness.\r\n\r\nBy one or more of the three first senses, or by the original sense of\r\nlabour in its (so to speak) integral idea, all the Homeric words may be\r\njustly rendered. Some of them will bear either the sense of swift, or\r\nthat of white: for instance, ἀργὴς with κεραυνός. In Aristotle[671],\r\nde Mundo, c. 4, we have τῶν κεραυνῶν ... οἱ ταχέως διάττοντες, ἀργῆτες\r\nλέγονται. And again, ἀργεστὴς with Νότος. This may mean the fleet\r\nNotus: it may also mean white, as carrying the light white cloud from\r\nover the sea, in the sense taken by Horace, who appears to have been an\r\naccurate and careful observer of Homeric epithets; and who says,\r\n\r\n    Albus ut obscuro deterget nubila cœlo\r\n      Sæpe Notus[672].\r\n\r\nThis sense of the word Argos will suit other uses of it which have not\r\nbeen yet named.\r\n\r\nFor instance, it will suit the ship Argo, which we may consider as\r\nswift, or, and perhaps preferably, as stout, strong, doing battle\r\nwith the waves: as we now say, a good ship, or a gallant ship. Again,\r\nit suits the noble dog Argus of the Odyssey, whose character would\r\nbe but inadequately represented by either patient, swift, or white.\r\nConsidering this word as the adjective of the word which describes what\r\nhas been well called by a writer of the present day, “noble, fruitful\r\nlabour,” we at once see him before us, swift as he had been, and\r\npatient as he was, but also brave, faithful, trustful, and trustworthy.\r\nArgus the spy, named in the Ἀργειφόντης of Homer, represents one\r\nside of the early meaning of the word[673]. The adjective ἀργαλέος,\r\nexaggerating as well as isolating that element of difficulty which the\r\nroot comprises, represents another: and the later word ἀργοῦντες[674],\r\nthe idle, catching the idea of slowness at the point where it passes\r\ninto inertness, similarly represents yet another.\r\n\r\nSuch being the case in regard to the name Ἄργος, we shall now have an\r\neasy task in dealing with Ἀργεῖοι.\r\n\r\nHomer employs this word in four places (to speak in round numbers) for\r\nthree in which he uses Δαναοί.\r\n\r\nHe employs it as an epithet, sometimes with the name of Juno, and\r\nfrequently with the name of Helen.\r\n\r\n_The Danaan Argives of Od. viii. 578._\r\n\r\nIn the Odyssey[675] we have this singular and rare juxtaposition of the\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n    Ἀργείων Δαναῶν ἠδ’ Ἰλίου οἶτον ἀκούων.\r\n\r\nNitzsch[676] observes, that we might almost suppose the word Ἀργείων\r\nto be an epithet, and this observation is quoted by G. Crusius.\r\nEustathius, the Scholiast, Barnes, Payne Knight, do not notice it.\r\nIt seems to me more agreeable to Homeric laws to treat Ἀργείων as the\r\nsubstantive, and Δαναῶν as the adjective. For as Homer knows of an\r\nAchaic, an Iasian, a Pelasgic Argos, so he may consistently speak of\r\nDanaan Argives, with the latent idea that there might be, and were,\r\nother Lowlanders out of Greece. But there were not, so far as we know,\r\nany other Danaans than a single Greek dynasty.\r\n\r\nHomer also in other places uses Δαναοὶ[677] as an adjective, with\r\nthe substantives ἥρωες and αἰχμηταί. He has no corresponding use of\r\nἈργεῖοι: thus the old idea of a _colonus_ or farming settler seems\r\nstill to colour the word, and lingers in it, even after it has grown to\r\nbe in common use a proper name.\r\n\r\nIn the application of the word Ἀργείη as an epithet to Juno and Helen,\r\nhe appears not to mean simply Greek but Argive Juno, Argive Helen, so\r\nthat the word here is not properly the singular of Ἀργεῖοι the national\r\nname, but simply the adjective formed from Ἄργος, in the sense of that\r\npart of Peloponnesus which formed the Pelopid dominions. To these Helen\r\nbelonged: and for that family, as previously for the Perseid race, Juno\r\nfelt her chief anxiety, evidently because they were the political heads\r\nof Greece.\r\n\r\nThus the use of Argeian as an adjective seems to be quite clearly\r\nlimited to a local sense of the word: and this being the case, it seems\r\nremarkable that the attention of the commentators before Nitzsch should\r\nnot have been directed to the line in the Eighth Odyssey, and that\r\nNitzsch, with ἥρωες Δαναοὶ and αἰχμηταὶ Δαναοὶ to guide him, should\r\nsuggest the sense of Argive Danaans, instead of Danaan Argives.\r\n\r\nThe local use, however, of the Argeian name must not be dismissed\r\nwithout a more full investigation. Let us first dispose of its use for\r\nJuno and Helen.\r\n\r\nThe proof that Helen is meant to be described as not merely Greek, but\r\nas connected with Achaic Argos or Eastern Peloponnesus, has already\r\nbeen sufficiently[678] set forth.\r\n\r\nAs respects Juno, we shall find that her affections always centre in\r\nthe house that was paramount in the chief seat of Hellenic power, the\r\nEastern Peloponnesus. Her tenacious attachments are constantly directed\r\nto the nation, and they survive dynastic changes. Hence her keen and\r\nventuresome feeling for Eurystheus; her never dying, never sleeping\r\nhatred to his rival Hercules; her esteem for Agamemnon equally with\r\nAchilles[679], though they were so unequal in fame and valour: perhaps\r\nsuggesting that Achilles was regarded by her either because he was\r\nnecessary for the purposes of Agamemnon, or because he was closely\r\nallied to the chief Achæan stock[680]. Hence it is that, when he has\r\nassumed his arms[681], she thunders in his honour: and hence her\r\nespecial love for the three cities, which were the symbols of Greek\r\npower, Argos, Sparta, and Mycenæ[682]. So intense is her attachment,\r\nthat she could wish to be the actual mother of the Greeks, even as she\r\nwould readily devour the Trojans upon occasion[683]. Hence, once more,\r\neven in the Odyssey, where she is almost a mute, it is mentioned, that\r\nAgamemnon[684] came safe across the sea, for Juno protected him. This\r\nis quite enough to fix the sense of Ἀργείη, when it is applied to Juno,\r\nas a local sense.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Homer’s use of this word with a restrained and local sense is\r\nnot only clear, but most carefully defined, both as to time and as to\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nWhile in the army before Troy he freely interchanges Danaan, Argive,\r\nand Achæan, as they are near enough to identity for his purpose, he\r\nnever applies Danaan at all to the Greeks at home, and employs the\r\nother two names with the most accurate discrimination.\r\n\r\n_Transition from Argeians to Achæans._\r\n\r\nThe Argeian name is confined in place to the Eastern Peloponnesus, and\r\nin time to the Perseid epoch. Upon the transfer of the sovereignty\r\nto the Pelopid house, the Argeian name ceases to be applied to their\r\nimmediate subjects. Let us now examine passages which may illustrate\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\n1. Two or nearly three generations before the _Troica_, in the time\r\nwhen Bellerophon was young, Prœtus ruled over the Ἀργεῖοι,\r\n\r\n                          πολὺ φέρτερος ἦεν\r\n    Ἀργείων· Ζεὺς γὰρ οἱ ὑπὸ σκηπτρῷ ἐδάμασσεν[685].\r\n\r\nNow Prœtus was certainly not lord of Greece. There was no lord\r\nparamount of Greece before the Pelopids: and near the time of Prœtus we\r\nhave Eurystheus, Œneus and his line, Cadmus and his line, Neleus and\r\nhis line, Minos and his line, as well as probably other thrones, each\r\nin its own place. But Prœtus falls within the period of the Perseids,\r\nand within the local circumscription of the Eastern Peloponnesus where\r\nthey reigned.\r\n\r\n2. But neither is Eurystheus spoken of by Homer as sovereign of Greece;\r\nthough he is king of the Argives[686],\r\n\r\n    ὃς Ἀργείοισιν ἀνάξει.\r\n\r\nFor when Juno fraudulently asks and obtains from Jupiter the promise\r\nthat the person to be born that day shall enjoy a certain sovereignty,\r\nit is not over the Argives, but over the περικτίονες:\r\n\r\n    ἦ μὲν τὸν πάντεσσι περικτιόνεσσιν ἀνάξειν\r\n    ὅς κεν ἐπ’ ἤματι τῷδε πέσῃ μετὰ ποσσὶ γυναικός.\r\n\r\nThus the promise is the babe shall reign over περικτίονες, a word\r\nclearly inapplicable to the whole of that straggling territory, which\r\nwas occupied irregularly by the Greeks. But when the fulfilment is\r\nclaimed, it is that he shall reign over Ἀργεῖοι. Therefore the two\r\nnames are coextensive, and accordingly Ἀργεῖοι does not mean all\r\nGreeks; for example, it does not include the line of Cadmus then ruling\r\nin Bœotia.\r\n\r\n3. But we come down to the time of Tydeus, who was lord of Argos during\r\nthe epoch of the Pelopid sovereigns. And now we find that his subjects\r\ncease to be called Ἀργεῖοι (see Il. v. 803. iv. 384) in the legends,\r\nwhere Homer observes a peculiar nicety in the application of these\r\nimportant words.\r\n\r\n_Local sense of the former name retained._\r\n\r\n4. Still the Argeian name continues to preserve its local application\r\nto the inhabitants of Argos and its district, or of Achaic Argos.\r\n\r\nAt the games on the death of Patroclus, Idomeneus thinks he discerns\r\nDiomed coming in as the winner, and he describes him thus:\r\n\r\n                  δοκέει δέ μοι ἔμμεναι ἀνὴρ\r\n    Αἴτωλος γενέην, μετὰ δ’ Ἀργείοισιν ἀνάσσει[687].\r\n\r\nIt is plain that here Idomeneus means among Argives, and not among\r\nGreeks.\r\n\r\n1. Because not Diomed was lord among the Greeks, but Agamemnon.\r\n\r\n2. Because Diomed was lord over a part of the Argives.\r\n\r\n3. Because the word is used in evident contradistinction to, and\r\ncorrespondence with, the foregoing word Αἴτωλος, which is undoubtedly\r\nlocal.\r\n\r\nAgain, when we are told that Orestes made a funeral feast for the\r\nἈργεῖοι[688], we may probably presume that we have here again the local\r\nsense.\r\n\r\nThus we see plainly enough the history of the rise of the Argive name.\r\nBelonging to the subjects of the ruling part of Greece, it grows so as\r\nto be applicable to all Greeks, in cases where no confusion can arise\r\nfrom its being thus employed. Thus the Roman name became applicable\r\nto Campanians or Calabrians as subjects of Rome, in contradistinction\r\nto Germans, Dacians, or Parthians; but if the subject in hand were\r\ndomestic and Italian, the domestic distinction would naturally revive.\r\nEven so Homer’s Greeks are all Argeians in the _Troica_: but at home\r\nthey have their local meaning, like Cadmeans, Ætolians, Pylians,\r\nElians, Epeans, Arcadians, Locrians, and also, as we shall find,\r\nAchæans.\r\n\r\nIt is at the very period of the local prevalence of the Argive name,\r\nthat we find also from Homer unequivocal appearances of a Cretan\r\nempire, circumscribing it by sea, and possibly more or less by\r\nland, though perhaps the Minoan power and dynasty may not at once\r\nhave acquired its Grecian character. If then, with respect to the\r\nword Ἀργεῖοι, we see that it was originally of limited and local\r\napplication; we have no reason whatever to suppose that the Danaan name\r\ncould ever have been of wider scope. Two questions then arise.\r\n\r\nFirst, why does Homer use the Danaan and Argive names as national, when\r\nthey were only local?\r\n\r\nSecondly, the priority of the Danaan name being clear, as we see\r\nthat the Danaan dynasty preceded that one whose subjects were called\r\nArgives, why did the Argive name supplant or succeed the Danaan?\r\n\r\nThe first question will be resumed hereafter, but I will now touch upon\r\nthe second.\r\n\r\nThe name Danaan, in all likelihood, was that of a dynasty originating\r\nbeyond seas; and if so, it could not well, until softened by the mellow\r\nhaze of distance, be more popular with the Greeks, when they had\r\nawakened under Hellic influence to a full consciousness of national\r\nlife, than it would have been with the English in the last century to\r\nbe called Hanoverians or Brunswickers.\r\n\r\nThe Danaid line ceased, when Perseus came to the throne, as he was\r\ndescended on the father’s side from another source.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more natural, than that with this change of dynasty\r\nan old and merely dynastic name should disappear. But why should it be\r\nsucceeded by the name Ἀργεῖοι?\r\n\r\n_Relation of Argeian and Pelasgian names._\r\n\r\nI hope it will not be thought too bold, if, founding myself on the\r\nprobable, perhaps I might say, plain resemblance of meaning between\r\nΠελασγοὶ and Ἀργεῖοι, I conjecture that on the disappearance from use\r\nof the name Δαναοὶ, instead of falling back upon the old agricultural\r\nname Πελασγοὶ, which had by a Danaan conquest become that of a\r\nsubordinate, if not servile class, the people may have come to bear the\r\nname Ἀργεῖοι; borrowed, like the other, from the region they inhabited,\r\nand from their habits of life in it, and of equal force, but without\r\nthe taint which attached to the designation of a depressed race.\r\n\r\nIn this view, the name Ἀργεῖοι may be defined to be the Hellic\r\nequivalent of the old Pelasgic appellation of the people of the\r\ncountry: and it naturally takes root upon the passing away of the\r\nDanaan power, within the dominions of those to whom that power had been\r\ntransferred.\r\n\r\nI shall hereafter have occasion to consider further, what was the first\r\nhistoric use of the Argeian name.\r\n\r\nThere are signs in the later Greek of the affinity, which I have\r\nhere supposed, between the Pelasgian and Argeian names, and of the\r\nassumption of the functions of the former by the latter. I do not enter\r\non the question of etymological identity, but I refer to similarity of\r\napplication alone.\r\n\r\n_Illustrations of the Etymology._\r\n\r\nIn Suidas we find the proverb Ἀργείους ὁρᾷς, with this explanation;\r\nπαροιμία ἐπὶ τῶν ἀτενῶς καὶ καταπληκτικῶς ὁρώντων. Now we know nothing\r\nof the Argives, that is, the inhabitants of Argolis, which would\r\nwarrant the supposition that they were of particularly savage and\r\nwild appearance. But if Ἀργεῖοι, as has been shown, originally meant\r\nsettlers in an agricultural district, and if in process of time the\r\npopulation gathered into towns, in lieu of their old manner of living\r\nκωμηδὸν, then, in consequence of the change, Ἀργεῖοι would come to mean\r\nrustics, as opposed to townspeople, and from this the transition would\r\nbe slight and easy to the sense of a wild and savage aspect, as in the\r\nproverb.\r\n\r\nLet us compare with it the Latin word _agrestis_. This I take to be\r\nprecisely similar, indeed identical, etymologically, with Ἀργεῖος.\r\nThe point of divergence is when Ἄργος by transposition becomes ἀγρὸς,\r\nwhence are _ager_ and _agrestis_. Materially this Latin word is in\r\nstill closer correspondence with ἀργηστὴς, a Greek derivative of ἄργος.\r\nIdeally, it passes through the very same process as has been shown in\r\nthe case of Ἀργεῖος, and here it is strongly supported by the common\r\nHomeric word ἄγριος, rude or savage, which comes from ἄγρος, made ready\r\nby transposition to yield such a derivative.\r\n\r\nThis name we find not only as an adjective, but likewise as a proper\r\nname. It is applied to a brother of Œneus and Melas, a son of\r\nPortheus[689]: and in these names we appear to see described the first\r\nrude Hellic invaders of Ætolia, at an epoch three generations before\r\nthe _Troica_. The _agrestis_, or agricultural settler, next comes to\r\nmean the class of country folk, as opposed to the inhabitants of towns\r\nor _urbani_; and then, while _urbanus_, with its Greek correlative\r\nἀστεῖος, passes on to acquire the meaning of cultivated and polished,\r\n_agrestis_, on the other hand, following a parallel movement with\r\nἈργεῖος, and in the opposite direction, comes to mean uneducated,\r\ncoarse, wild, barbarous. Thus Ovid says of the river Achelous, when he\r\nhad been mutilated by the loss of his horn in the combat with Hercules,\r\n\r\n            Vultus Achelous agrestes\r\n    Et lacerum cornu mediis caput abdidit undis[690].\r\n\r\nThus Cicero, in the Tusculans, after a description of the battles of\r\nthe Spartan youths, carried on not only with fists and feet, but with\r\nnails and teeth, asks, _Quæ barbaria India (~al.~ barbaries Indica)\r\nvastior atque agrestior?_\r\n\r\nWe also find in Suidas the phrase Ἀργεῖοι φῶρες, and this explanation:\r\nἘπὶ τῶν προδήλως πονηρῶν· οἱ γὰρ Ἀργεῖοι ἐπὶ κλοπῇ κωμῳδοῦνται.\r\nἈριστοφάνης Ἀναγύρῳ.\r\n\r\nNo part of this play remains, so that we are left to general reasoning:\r\nbut it seems a most natural explanation of this proverb or phrase,\r\nthat the word Ἀργεῖος, meaning wild and savage, should be applied to\r\nbanditti: theft in the early stages of society, always frequenting\r\nsolitary places, as in the later ones, it rather draws to the most\r\ncrowded haunts of men.\r\n\r\nAgain, Æschines, in the Περὶ Παραπρεσβείας, brings the grossest\r\npersonal charges against Demosthenes, for offences, which he says\r\nhad brought upon him various nicknames. Among these, he thus accuses\r\nhim: Ἐκ παιδῶν δὲ ἀπαλλαττόμενος, καὶ δεκαταλάντους δίκας ἑκαστῷ τῶν\r\nἐπιτρόπων λαγχάνων, Ἄργας ἐκλήθη. This passage is noticed by both\r\nSuidas and Hesychius under Ἀργὰς, and it is explained ὄνομα ὀφέως. A\r\nserpent, either generally or of some particular kind, had, it seems,\r\nthe name of Ἀργὰς, which we can easily derive from ἄργος, taken in the\r\nsame sense as that in which it became the name of Argus the spy. ‘Now\r\nthe serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field[691].’ But\r\nthis does not seem to satisfy the intention of the highly vituperative\r\npassage in Æschines. This imputation of extreme cleverness or craft\r\nwould not have been perhaps a very effective one in Greece. I think he\r\nmore probably means to call Demosthenes a swindler or plunderer, _homo\r\ntrium literarum_, from whom his guardians were trying to recover, and\r\nwho was likely to be exposed, not like the serpent, to get off: and\r\nin this sense the word Ἀργὰς at once attaches itself to the reported\r\npassage in Aristophanes, and through that to the old meaning of\r\n_agrestis_ or Ἀργεῖος. Nor is Ἀργεῖος, a thief, more remote in sense\r\nfrom Ἀργεῖος, a rural settler, than is _paganus_, an idolater, from\r\n_paganus_, a villager.\r\n\r\nI will take yet one more illustration, Hesychius under Ἀργεῖοι gives\r\nthis explanation; ἐκ τῶν Εἱλώτων οἱ πιστευόμενοι οὕτως ἐλέγοντο, ἢ\r\nλαμπροί. Now the sense of λαμπροὶ might easily be derived from the\r\nprimitive sense, in the same way as that of whiteness. But it is quite\r\ndistinct from the explanation respecting that select and trusted\r\nclass of Helots, who were called Ἀργεῖοι. This usage both serves to\r\nexplain history, and is explained by it. Ἀργεῖοι was the name of the\r\nGreek citizen in Eastern Peloponnesus under the Perseids; it appears\r\nin part to have retained its local force throughout the period of the\r\nPelopids; for though in the legend of Tydeus the inhabitants of Argolis\r\nwe at least find the name Ἀχαιοὶ among them, yet in the Twenty-third\r\nIliad, and in the Third Odyssey, they are called Ἀργεῖοι. In the local\r\nusage, then, the Helot meaning a serf, the emancipated Helot would be\r\na citizen, an Ἀργεῖος. But neither serfship nor citizenship were in\r\nthose days rigidly defined, and the one ran into the other. What could\r\nunder such circumstances be more natural, than that any Helot who was\r\nseparated from his brethren, by being taken into the confidence of his\r\nmaster, and living on easy terms with him, should acquire the name of\r\nἈργεῖος, and, that the class who had thus obtained it in a somewhat\r\npeculiar sense, that is to say, the sense of a free rural settler, or\r\n(so to speak) freeholder, should continue to bear it as descriptive of\r\ntheir own position, even when it had ceased to be generally applicable\r\nto the free Greeks of that particular district? which of course it\r\ncould no longer be when the family and dynastic tie between Argolis and\r\nLacedæmon came to be dissolved.\r\n\r\nAnd if I am right in supposing that even in Homer[692] the name Ἀργεῖοι\r\nevidently leans towards the masses, and that of Ἀχαιοὶ towards the\r\nselect few or chiefs, such a distinction is in marked harmony with the\r\nwhole of this inquiry respecting the force of the former phrase.\r\n\r\n_Different extent of Ἀργεῖοι and Ἄργος._\r\n\r\nAccording to the view which has been here given, we must carefully\r\ndistinguish between the sense of Ἀργεῖοι, as a national name in Homer,\r\nand that of Ἄργος, in this respect. The name Ἀργεῖοι was raised to\r\nthe distinction of a national name apparently in consequence of\r\nthe political ascendancy of a house that reigned over territories\r\nspecially named Ἄργος, and over subjects named from the region Ἀργεῖοι.\r\nI say this without undertaking to determine whether there actually\r\nwas a period in which the Greeks were as a nation called Ἀργεῖοι, a\r\nsupposition which seems to me improbable: or whether it was a name\r\nwhich Homer applied to them poetically, like the name Δαναοὶ, because\r\nit had once been the proper designation of those who held the seat\r\nof Greek supremacy. In either view, however, the case of the name\r\nἌργος is different. That name had not its root in political power,\r\nactual or remembered: it kept its place, as being founded in a good\r\nphysical description, so far as it went, of the general character of\r\nthe principal habitable parts of the peninsula which the Hellic tribes,\r\nswarming downwards from their hills, successively and gradually\r\noccupied. Hence the substantive was, as we see, capable of spreading\r\nbeyond the adjective in space, since, while we have an Iasian and a\r\nPelasgian Ἄργος, we have no Iasian or Pelasgian Ἀργεῖοι. Thus they were\r\ndetached one from the other. In Homer the epithet has a larger range\r\nof clear signification than the substantive. But apart from Homer the\r\nsubstantive appears from etymology to have been the older, and from\r\nhistory either to have reached points at which the adjective never\r\narrived, or to have long survived its desuetude.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Achæans._\r\n\r\n_Particulars of the use of the Achæan name._\r\n\r\nThe lights, which we have already obtained in considering the Danaan\r\nand Argive names, will assist the inquiry with respect to the Achæans.\r\nAt the same time, the fullest view of that name and race cannot be\r\nattained, until we shall have succeeded in fixing what we are to\r\nunderstand by the Homeric ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν.\r\n\r\nI now proceed, however, to show from the text of the poems,\r\n\r\n1. That of the three great appellatives of the nation, the name Ἀχαιοὶ\r\nis the most familiar.\r\n\r\n2. That the manner of its national use indicates the political\r\npredominance of an Achæan race, in the Homeric age, over other races,\r\nranged by its side in the Troic enterprise, and composing along with it\r\nthe nation, which owned Agamemnon for its head.\r\n\r\n3. That, besides its national use, the name Ἀχαιοὶ has also an\r\nimportant local and particular use for a race which had spread through\r\nGreece, and which exercised sway among its population.\r\n\r\n4. That the manner of its local and particular use points out to\r\nus, with considerable clearness, the epoch at which it acquired\r\npreponderance, namely that when Pelops and his family acquired\r\nascendancy in Greece.\r\n\r\nAs respects the first of these propositions, the numerical test,\r\nalthough a rude one, yet appears to be conclusive. We find that Homer\r\nuses the name Ἀργεῖοι in the plural two hundred and five times, of\r\nwhich twenty-eight are in the Odyssey; besides fifteen passages in\r\nwhich the singular is used. And the name Δαναοὶ about one hundred and\r\nsixty times, of which thirteen are in the Odyssey. But we find the name\r\nἈχαιοὶ, employed from seven to eight hundred times: that is to say,\r\nfive hundred and ninety-seven times in the Iliad, and one hundred and\r\nseventeen times in the Odyssey; all these in the plural number, besides\r\nthirty-two places of the poems in which it is used in the singular, or\r\nin its derivatives Ἀχαίïς or Ἀχαιïκός.\r\n\r\nThe particulars next to be stated will bear at once upon the first and\r\nupon the second proposition.\r\n\r\nHomer very rarely attaches any epithet to the name Ἀργεῖοι, more\r\nfrequently by much to Δαναοὶ, and still oftener to Ἀχαιοί. To the first\r\nonly six times in all: to the second twenty-four: and to the third near\r\none hundred and forty times. It is not likely that metrical convenience\r\nis the cause of this diversity. We have already seen that Ἀργεῖοι is\r\nsusceptible of a substantive force, which will carry one at least of\r\nthe other names by way of epithet, as if it indicated an employment,\r\nand not properly the name of a race. A like inference may be drawn from\r\nthe greater susceptibility of carrying descriptive epithets, which we\r\nnow find the Danaan and Achæan names evince. For example, the name of\r\nthe Scotts, Douglasses, or Grahams, four centuries ago, would have\r\nafforded larger scope for characteristic epithets than such a name as\r\nFarmers or Colonists, when used to point out a particular people, or\r\nthan such a name as Lowlanders, while it still retained its descriptive\r\ncharacter, and had not yet become purely titular or proper. We must\r\nprobably look, then, to political significance for the basis of the use\r\nmade by Homer of the Achæan name.\r\n\r\nWhen we examine the character of the epithets, this presumption is\r\ngreatly corroborated. Homer uses with the word Ἀχαιοὶ, and with this\r\nword only, epithets indicating, firstly, high spirit, secondly,\r\npersonal beauty, and thirdly, finished armour[693]. I take these to be\r\nof themselves sufficient signs, even were others wanting, to point to\r\nthe Achæans as being properly the ruling class, or aristocracy, of the\r\nheroic age.\r\n\r\nThe Achæan name, again, attains with Homer to a greater variety of use\r\nand inflexion than the Danaan or Argeian names.\r\n\r\nHe has worked it into the female forms Ἀχαιΐδες, Ἀχαιïάδες, Ἀχαιαὶ, as\r\non the other side he has done with the names Τρῶες into Τρωὲς, Τρωάδες,\r\nand Τρωαὶ, and Δάρδανοι into Δαρδανίδες: but he has not made any such\r\nuse of the names Ἀργεῖοι and Δαναοί. The female use of the former\r\nappears indeed in the singular with the names of Juno and of Helen,\r\nbut never as applicable to Greek women in general, or to a Greek woman\r\nsimply as such.\r\n\r\nHe uses it in the singular to describe ‘a Greek’ Ἀχαιὸς ἄνηρ, Il. iii.\r\n167, 226: which he never does for the two other names. In the same\r\nmanner he uses Δάρδανος ἄνηρ, Il. ii. 701. This form seems to indicate\r\nthe full and familiar establishment of a name; and the Dardanians had,\r\nwe know, been Dardanians for seven generations before the _Troica_ (Il.\r\nxx. 215-40).\r\n\r\nIn the opening passage of the First Iliad, not less than in that\r\nof the Odyssey, Homer has, as it is generally observed by critics,\r\nintentionally given us a summary or ‘Argument’ of his poem. But I doubt\r\nwhether sufficient notice has been taken of the very effective manner\r\nin which he has given force to his purpose, by taking care in that\r\npassage to use the most characteristic words. Achilles is there the son\r\nof Peleus, for his extraction, as on both sides divine, but especially\r\nas on the father’s side from Jupiter, is the groundwork of his high\r\nposition in the poem. Agamemnon is likewise here introduced under the\r\ntitle which establishes the same origin for him, and more than any\r\nthing else enhances the dignity of his supremacy before men[694]. And\r\nthe Greeks too, if I am correct, are not without significancy here\r\nintroduced to us, as is right, under their highest and also their best\r\nestablished designation, that of Achæans. Nor is it until they have\r\nbeen five times called Achæans[695] that he introduces the Danaan\r\nname[696] at all. The Argive name, as if the weakest, when it is first\r\nemployed, is placed in an awkward nearness to the title of Achæans,\r\nperhaps by way of explanation:\r\n\r\n                      ὃς μέγα πάντων\r\n    Ἀργείων κρατέει, καὶ οἱ πείθονται Ἀχαιοί[697].\r\n\r\nAgain the paramount force of the Achæan name may justly be inferred\r\nfrom its being the only territorial name which had clearly grasped the\r\nwhole of Greece at the epoch of the _Troica_[698].\r\n\r\nTurning now entirely to what indicates more or less of peculiar\r\ncharacter in the Achæans, I would observe, that the adjective δῖοι\r\nappears to be the highest of all the national epithets employed by\r\nHomer; and this he couples, as has been observed by Mure[699], (who\r\nrecognises a peculiar force in the term,) with the Achæan designation\r\nalone among the three. He also applies it to the Pelasgi; for whom, as\r\nwe have found, he means it to be a highly honourable epithet. Probably\r\nthe Achæans are δῖοι because of preeminence, the Pelasgians because\r\nof antiquity. To no other nation or tribe whatever does he apply this\r\nepithet. His very chary use of it in the plural is a sign of its\r\npossessing in his eyes some peculiar virtue.\r\n\r\n_Signs of its leaning to the aristocracy._\r\n\r\nOf its feminine forms one has been selected to convey the most biting\r\nform of reproach to the army, in the speech of Thersites. Now it is\r\nremarkable that in that speech, of which an inflated presumption is\r\nthe great mark, the Achæan name is used five times within nine lines,\r\nand neither of the other names is used at all. I do not doubt that\r\nthe upstart and braggart uses this name only because it was the most\r\ndistinguished or aristocratic name, as an ill-bred person always takes\r\npeculiar care to call himself a gentleman. And doubtless it is for the\r\nsame reason that he takes the feminine of Ἀχαιὸς, instead of using\r\nΔανααὶ or Ἀργειαὶ for his interpretative epithet, when he wants to\r\nsting the soldiery as ‘Greekesses and not Greeks.’\r\n\r\nSomewhat similar evidence is supplied by the Homeric phrase υἷες\r\nἈχαιῶν, which has nothing corresponding to it under the Danaan or\r\nArgive names. This is an Homeric formula, and the form υἷες seems to\r\nbelong exclusively to the Achæan name. To the Greeks who always asked\r\nthe stranger who were his parents, this phrase would carry a peculiar\r\nsignificance. What addressed them as the sons of honoured parents\r\nwould be to them the sharpest touchstone of honour or disgrace. And\r\nwhat the patronymic was to the individual, this form of speech was to\r\nthe nation, an incentive under the form of an embellishment. It is a\r\nprinciple that runs throughout Homer; it is every where μηδὲ γένος\r\nπατέρων αἰσχύνεμεν. The poet could not say sons of Danaans, for their\r\nforefathers were not Danaan: nor sons of Argeians, for this would\r\nrecall the ploughshare and not the sword: though the army are addressed\r\nfrom time to time as ἥρωες Δαναοὶ, and ἥρωες Ἀχαιοὶ, they are never\r\nἥρωες Ἀργεῖοι. But to be sons of the Achæans was the great glory of the\r\nrace, even as to degenerate from being Achæan warriors into effeminacy\r\nwould have been its deepest reproach: and the fact that he calls a\r\nmixed race sons of the Achæans is conversely a proof that the Achæan\r\nelement was the highest and most famous element in the compound of\r\ntheir ancestry.\r\n\r\nBut, unless I am mistaken, we have many passages in Homer where the use\r\nof the simple term Ἀχαιοὶ is shown from the context to have a special\r\nand peculiar, sometimes perhaps even an exclusive reference to the\r\nchiefs and leaders of the army. I think it may be shown that the word\r\nhas in fact three meanings:\r\n\r\n1. That of a particular Greek race, which extended itself from point to\r\npoint, acquiring power everywhere as it spread, by inherent superiority.\r\n\r\n2. That of the aristocracy of the country, which it naturally became by\r\nvirtue of such extension and assumption.\r\n\r\n3. That of the whole nation, which takes the name from its prime part.\r\n\r\nWe have now to examine some passages in support of the second meaning:\r\nand I know not why, but certainly these passages appear in the Iliad to\r\nbe most abundant near the opening of the poem.\r\n\r\nChryses solicits ‘all the Achæans and most the two Atridæ[700].’ All\r\nthe Achæans assent, except Agamemnon. Now the priest could not solicit\r\nthe army generally except in an assembly: and there is no mention of\r\none, indeed the reply of Agamemnon[701] is hardly such as would have\r\nbeen given in one. It is likely, then, that those whom he addressed\r\nwere Agamemnon’s habitual and ordinary associates; in other words, the\r\nchiefs.\r\n\r\nWhen Calchas proceeds to invoke the vengeance of Apollo, which is to\r\nfall upon the army at large, it is no longer the Ἀχαιοὶ of whom he\r\nspeaks, but his prayer is,\r\n\r\n    τισείαν Δαναοὶ ἐμὰ δάκρυα σοῖσι βέλεσσιν[702].\r\n\r\nAlthough I do not concur with those, who find no element of real\r\nfreedom in the condition of the Greek masses, whether at home or in the\r\ncamp, yet it seems plain enough, from the nature of the case, that the\r\nquestions relating to the division of booty, as being necessarily an\r\nexecutive affair, must have been decided by the chiefs. Now whenever\r\nquestions of this class are handled, we generally find such an office\r\nascribed to Ἀχαιοί. Agamemnon says[703], ‘Do not let me alone of\r\nthe Argeians go without a prize;’ and in conformity with this we\r\nfind Nestor stimulating the host at large with the expectation of\r\nbooty[704]. But Achilles replies to Agamemnon, ‘that the _Achæans_ have\r\nit not in their power to compensate him there and then, for they have\r\nno common stock:’ but ‘when Troy is taken, then we the Achæans will\r\nrepay you three and four fold[705].’ The same subject is again touched\r\nin i. 135, 162, 392. ii. 227: and both times with reference to the\r\nἈχαιοὶ as the distributors of the spoil. In Il. ii. 255 it is allotted\r\nby the ἥρωες Δαναοί.\r\n\r\nIn the same way we find a decided leaning to the use of the word\r\nἈχαιοὶ, when reference is made to other governing duties.\r\n\r\nFor instance, in the adjuration of Achilles by the staff or sceptre.\r\n‘It has been stripped of leaf and bark, and now the υἷες Ἀχαιῶν,\r\nwho are intrusted by Jupiter with sovereign functions, bear it in\r\nhand[706].’ It is hardly possible here to construe the phrase without\r\nlimiting it to the chiefs.\r\n\r\nI have referred to the passage where Homer introduces the word Ἀργεῖοι\r\nfor the first time, under the shadow, as it were, of Ἀχαιοί. Now, if we\r\nexamine that passage, we shall perceive that unless there be some shade\r\nwhatever of difference in the meaning, the words are tautological, an\r\nimputation which Homer never merits. But if we admit in the Achæan\r\nname a certain bias towards the nobles of the army, then the sense and\r\nexpressions are alike appropriate. ‘I fear the resentment of him, who\r\nmightily lords it over (all) the Greeks, and to whom even the Achæans\r\n(or chiefs) submit themselves[707].’\r\n\r\nAgain the phrase Ἀχαιὸς ἄνηρ[708], twice used by Homer, and both times\r\nin the mouth of Priam from the Trojan wall, both times also refers\r\nto noble and chieftainlike figures, which his eye, keen for beauty,\r\ndiscerns among the crowd. The second case is particularly worthy of\r\nnotice:\r\n\r\n    τίς τ’ ἄρ’ ὅδ’ ἄλλος Ἀχαιὸς ἀνὴρ ἤυς τε μέγας τε,\r\n    ἔξοχος Ἀργείων κεφάλην ἠδ’ εὔρεας ὤμους;\r\n\r\nOf which the effect seems to be expressed in these words:\r\n\r\n    Who is th’ Achæan Chieftain\r\n      So beautiful and tall?\r\n    His shoulders broad surmount the crowd,\r\n      His head outtops them all.\r\n\r\nHere again, if Achæan and Argeian be synonymous, the use of the latter\r\nword is in the highest degree insipid, but if the reference be to\r\nthe chief, excelling in height the mass of the soldiery, a perfect\r\npropriety is maintained.\r\n\r\nI need not extend these illustrations to other passages, such as Il.\r\nii. 80, 346. ix. 670. And, on the other hand, it is easy to point to\r\npassages where the force of the Achæan and Argeian names is obviously\r\nidentical, such as Il. ix. 521: or again where Achæan and Danaan must\r\nagree, as in Il. ix. 641, 2. The most frequent use of the Achæan name\r\nis, I believe, for the nation, and not the race or class: yet a number\r\nof passages remain to show the native bias and primitive meaning of the\r\nword.\r\n\r\nI will however point out two more places, one in each poem, where\r\nthat shading of the sense, for which I contend, will either greatly\r\nfacilitate the rendering of the text, or even may be called requisite\r\nin order to attain a tolerable construction.\r\n\r\n1. It deserves particular notice, that Homer sometimes places the words\r\nin very close proximity, as in the following passage;\r\n\r\n                νηῶν ἐπ’ ἀρίστερα δηιόωντο\r\n    λαοὶ ὑπ’ Ἀργείων· τάχα δ’ ἂν καὶ κῦδος Ἀχαιῶν\r\n    ἔπλετο· τοῖος γὰρ Γαιήοχος Ἐννοσίγαιος\r\n    ὤτρυν’ Ἀργείους·\r\n\r\nThis is in Il. xiii. 676-8, and Δαναῶν follows in 680. The nearness of\r\nthe words, and the place of Ἀχαιοὶ, between the twice used Ἀργεῖοι, is\r\nhighly insipid and un-Homeric, if they are pure equivalents. But now it\r\nseems by no means impossible, that the Poet may in this passage have in\r\nview a distinction between the leaders and the mass. He may have meant\r\nto say, ‘Hector had not yet learned that his men were suffering havock\r\non the left from the Greek troops. But so it was; and the chiefs might\r\nnow perhaps have won fame, such was the might with which Neptune urged\r\non their forces,’ but that, &c.\r\n\r\n2. It is difficult, except upon the supposition of a different shade of\r\nmeaning in these appellatives, to construe at all such a passage as\r\n\r\n                ἐξερέεινεν ἕκαστα,\r\n    Ἴλιον, Ἀργείων τε νέας, καὶ νόστον Ἀχαιῶν[709].\r\n\r\nHere the juxtaposition of the words, if they are synonymous, becomes\r\nabsolutely intolerable. But the sense runs easily and naturally, if we\r\nrender it ‘he inquired (of me) all about (the fall of) Troy, and the\r\nfleet (or armament) of the Greeks, and the adventures of the chiefs\r\nwhile on their way home.’\r\n\r\nThe Odyssey, however, appears to offer a larger contribution towards\r\nour means of comprehending the Homeric use of Ἀχαιοὶ, than can be\r\nsupplied by the mere citation of particular passages.\r\n\r\n_Its application within Ithaca._\r\n\r\nThere is considerable evidence of a division of races in Ithaca: and\r\nalso of the application of the Achæan name to the aristocracy of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe length of time during which Ulysses had been absent, will account\r\nfor much disorganization in his dominions: and their lying chiefly in\r\nseparate insular possessions would tend to aggravate the evil. Still\r\nnot only Nestor, Idomeneus[710], Philoctetes, Neoptolemus, but also\r\nMenelaus, who was absent almost as long as Ulysses himself, appear\r\nto have resumed their respective thrones without difficulty; so that\r\nwe are led to suppose there must have been much peculiarity in the\r\ncase of Ithaca. Part of this we may find in the fact, that the family\r\nof Ulysses may but recently have attained to power, and that the\r\nconsolidation of races was imperfect. Besides his force of character,\r\nhe had accumulated[711] great wealth, following in the footsteps of his\r\nfather Laertes, who was both a conqueror and an economist[712]. His\r\npower, thus depending on what was personal to himself, could not but be\r\nshaken to its very base by his departure, and by his long detention in\r\nforeign parts.\r\n\r\nSo far as we can learn from the text of Homer, the family of Ulysses\r\nhad come, like the other Hellic families, from the north: and it had\r\nonly reigned in Ithaca at most for two generations. His extraction is\r\nnot stated further back than his paternal grandfather Arceisius[713].\r\nBut his connections all appear to be in the north. His maternal\r\ngrandfather, Autolycus[714], lived by Parnesus, or Parnassus, in\r\nPhocis, near to Delphi. And his wife’s father, Icarius, had a daughter\r\nIphthime, who was married to Eumelus[715], heir-apparent of Pheræ in\r\nthe south of Thessaly: a circumstance which affords a presumption of\r\nproximity in their dominions. Thus it is probable that Laertes may have\r\nmarried in Thessaly; and, as we have no mention of the sovereignty of\r\nArceisius, it is highly probable that Laertes was the first, either to\r\nacquire the Ithacan throne, or at least to hold it for any length of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe fountain near the city, which supplied it with water, and which\r\nprobably marks its foundation, was constructed, as we are told, by\r\nIthacus, Neritus, and Polyctor[716].\r\n\r\nThe first must have been the Eponymist of the island: the second of its\r\nprincipal mountain[717].\r\n\r\nPeisander, called ἄναξ and Πολυκτορίδης[718], is one of four principal\r\nSuitors, whose gifts to Penelope are specifically mentioned in the\r\nEighteenth Odyssey. Thus he would appear to have been most probably\r\nnephew to the Eponymist of the island. Sometimes indeed the patronymic\r\nis derived from a grandfather, or even, as in the case of Priam\r\n(Δαρδανίδης, Il. xxiv. 629, 631), from a remote ancestor; but then he\r\nmust apparently be a founder, or one of the highest fame. But Peisander\r\nat the least may have been the son of Polyctor; and he was probably\r\nthe representative of the family, which had been displaced from the\r\nSovereignty by the house of Laertes. He afterwards appears among the\r\nleaders in the struggle of the Suitors with Ulysses[719].\r\n\r\nThe names applied to the subjects of Ulysses in the Odyssey are three:\r\nΚεφαλλῆνες, Ἰθακήσιοι, and Ἀχαιοί. In accordance with its use in the\r\nIliad, the first of these, which is but four times[720] used, appears\r\nto be a name of the whole people of the state; and, judging from what\r\nwe have seen of the force of the word, it implies that the Hellenic\r\nelement was dominant. The difference in the use of the other two is\r\nvery marked.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the Suitors are commonly called Ἀχαιοὶ[721], never\r\nἸθακήσιοι, nor ever Δαναοὶ or Ἀργεῖοι. Either, being the aristocracy,\r\nthey were an Achæan race; or else, without all being of Achæan race,\r\nthey were called Achæan, because they were the aristocracy. Of that\r\nclass they are stated to have constituted the whole[722].\r\n\r\nThe more probable of these two suppositions is, that they were by no\r\nmeans exclusively of Achæan blood, but took the name from their birth\r\nand station. It is most natural to suppose that the displaced family\r\nof Peisander, and probably others, were not Achæan, but belonged to an\r\nolder stock. This stock may have been Hellenic; for, as we know, there\r\nwere Hellenic, and in particular Æolid, families in Greece long before\r\nwe hear of the Achæans there.\r\n\r\nThe house of Ulysses still indeed had friends in the island, like\r\nMentor, like Noemon, son of Phronius, (or the class represented by\r\nthese names, if they be typical only,) or like Peiræus, who took charge\r\nof Theoclymenus at the request of Telemachus[723]. But the bulk of\r\nthe people were neutral, or else unfriendly. The best that Telemachus\r\ncan say is, that the _whole_ people is not hostile[724]. And in the\r\nlast Book, whilst more than one half the Assembly take up arms against\r\nUlysses the rest simply[725] remain neutral: so that he has no one to\r\nrely upon but his father, his son, and a mere handful of dependents.\r\n\r\nWhile the Achæan name is thus exclusively applied to the Suitors, and\r\napparently to them because they formed the aristocracy, the people,\r\nwhen assembled, are invariably addressed as Ἰθακήσιοι. It is said\r\nindeed, that the Achæans[726] were summoned by the heralds to the\r\nAssembly of the Second Book: but it seems to have been customary\r\nto send a special summons only to principal persons, as we find in\r\nScheria[727]; though all classes were expected to attend, and did\r\nattend.\r\n\r\nI do not, however, venture to treat it as certain, that the word Ἀχαιοὶ\r\nis not applied to the population of Ithaca generally. When Euripides\r\naddresses the Assembly, and incites the people to revenge the death of\r\nthe Suitors, we are told that οἶκτος δ’ ἕλε πάντας Ἀχαιούς. This may\r\nmean the aristocratic party in the Assembly, as we know that there were\r\ntwo sections very differently minded. At any rate, if the whole people\r\nbe meant, it is by the rarest possible exception. The name is applied,\r\nas we should expect, to the soldiers who sailed with Ulysses to Troy:\r\nbut within Ithaca it seems clear that the name properly denotes the\r\nnobles. And upon the whole it seems most probable, that these Ἀχαιοὶ,\r\nin the Twenty-third Book, are the party of the Suitors, with reference\r\nrather to their position in society than their extraction: while the\r\nminority, who do not join in the movement against Ulysses, are probably\r\nthe old population of the island, who have no cause of quarrel to make\r\nthem take up arms against him, and yet no such tie with him, either\r\nof race or of ancient subordination, as to induce them to move in his\r\nfavour.\r\n\r\nIthaca was ill fitted for tillage, or for feeding anything but sheep\r\nand goats. And Ithacus, its eponymist, being a very modern personage,\r\nit seems highly probable that, whether Achæan or not, he and his race\r\nwere Hellenic, and gave to the population that peculiar name of\r\nCephallenes, under which Laertes describes them as his subjects. But\r\nthere were probably anterior inhabitants of the old Pelasgian stock,\r\nsubmerged beneath two Hellenic immigrations, caring little which of\r\ntheir lords was uppermost, and forming the supine minority of the final\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\nThe use of the Achæan name in Ithaca, in broad separation from the\r\nIthacesian, must then prove either its connection with a race, or its\r\nbias towards a class, and may prove both. But quitting the latter as\r\nsufficiently demonstrated, I now proceed to trace the local use of the\r\nAchæan name.\r\n\r\nAnd, first of all, we find it locally used in the North; in that\r\nThessaly, where the name of Hellas came into being, and from whence it\r\nextended itself to the Southward; therefore in the closest connection\r\nwith the Hellic stem.\r\n\r\nWe are told in the Catalogue, with respect to the division under\r\nAchilles, after the names of the districts and places from which they\r\ncame,\r\n\r\n    Μυρμίδονες δὲ καλεῦντο, καὶ Ἕλληνες, καὶ Ἀχαιοί[728].\r\n\r\nNow we find throughout the Iliad, that the local or divisional name\r\nof this body is unchanging: the troops of Achilles are uniformly\r\ndenominated Myrmidons. Therefore Homer does not mean that one part were\r\nMyrmidons, another Hellenes, another Achæans, but that the three names\r\nattached to the whole body, of course in different respects. They were\r\nthen Myrmidons, whatever the source of that name may have been, by\r\ncommon designation. They were Hellenes, because inhabitants of Hellas,\r\nof the territory from whence the influence and range of that name\r\nhad already begun to radiate, more properly and eminently therefore\r\nHellenes, than others who had not so positively acquired the name,\r\nthough they may have been included in the Πανέλληνες. And manifestly\r\nthey could only be called Ἀχαιοὶ, because known to be under leaders of\r\nthe pure Achæan stock, who were entitled to carry the name in their own\r\nright, instead of bearing it only in a derivative sense, and because\r\nit had spread all over Greece. Of this peculiar and eminent Achæanism\r\nin the Peleid stock, we have, I think, two other signs from the poems:\r\none in the possible meaning of the love of Juno, which we have seen\r\nextended to Achilles in an equal degree with Agamemnon; the other\r\nin the marriage of Hermione to Neoptolemus, which was founded upon\r\na promise given by Menelaus her father while before Troy. Doubtless\r\nthe eminent services of Neoptolemus might be the sole ground of this\r\npromise: but it may also have had to do with kin, as some special\r\nrelation, of neighbourhood or otherwise, appears commonly to accompany\r\nthese matrimonial connections. In conformity with this passage, the\r\nname Ἀχαίιδες is applied by Achilles in the Ninth Book to the women of\r\nHellas and Phthia.\r\n\r\n_Local uses of the Achæan name._\r\n\r\nIt is wonderfully illustrative of the perspicacity and accuracy of\r\nHomer, to find that in this very spot, which he has so especially\r\nmarked with the Achæan name, it continued to subsist as a local\r\nappellation, and to subsist here almost exclusively, all through the\r\nhistoric ages of Greece. On this subject we shall have further occasion\r\nto touch.\r\n\r\n2. Of the five races who inhabited Crete at the time of the _Troica_,\r\none was Achæan[729]:\r\n\r\n                ἐν μὲν Ἀχαιοὶ\r\n    ἐν δ’ Ἐτεοκρῆτες μεγαλήτορες, ἐν δὲ Κύδωνες,\r\n    Δωριέες τε τριχάïκες, δῖοί τε Πελασγοί.\r\n\r\nThe presence of an Achæan tribe in Crete may have been due to its\r\nconstant intercourse with Eastern Peloponnesus[730], where the Achæans\r\nhad for some time been dominant: or to those relations with Thessaly,\r\nto which the name of Deucalion in Homer bears probable witness. In any\r\ncase, the passage clearly establishes the local virtue of the name.\r\nIt also exhibits to us Achæans as distinct from Dorians, and shows us\r\nthat there were a variety of branches, known to Homer, of the Hellenic\r\ntree. And the enumeration of the Achæan and Pelasgian races with others\r\nin this place, compared with the uniform description in the Iliad of\r\nthe whole force of Idomeneus as Cretan, shows us how careful Homer was\r\nto avoid such confusion as the juxtaposition of Achæans and Pelasgians\r\nwould have caused with reference to the main ethnical division in the\r\nIliad.\r\n\r\n3. In the Pylian raid of the Eleventh Book, Nestor carefully\r\ndistinguishes between the parties, as Epeans, also called Elians, on\r\nthe one side, and Pylians, also called Achæans, on the other[731]. This\r\nraid took place in his early youth, perhaps forty or fifty years before\r\nthe _Troica_, and within the Achæan epoch. And as he withholds the\r\nAchæan name from the other party, they plainly were not Achæan in the\r\nlimited sense. And yet they were Hellenic: for, among other Hellenic\r\nsigns, Augeas, the king of the Epeans, was an ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν. Thus again\r\nwe have Achæan fixed as a subdivision, though probably the principal\r\nsubdivision, of the Hellenic race.\r\n\r\n4. A fourth case, in which the Achæan name appears clearly to have a\r\nlimited signification, is in a second passage of the Greek Catalogue,\r\nwhere a part of the forces of Diomed are described as those,\r\n\r\n    οἵ τ’ ἔχον Αἰγίνην, Μάσητά τε, κοῦροι Ἀχαιῶν[732].\r\n\r\nAlthough Mases has been taken to be a town, yet its junction here\r\nwith Ægina perhaps rather points to it as an island. It appears to be\r\nadmitted that its site is unknown. And an extra-Homeric tradition[733]\r\nreports, that the small islands off the Trœzenian coast were called\r\nafter Pelops. It is impossible not to observe the correspondence\r\nbetween this tradition, and the indirect traditions afforded us by\r\nHomer’s language in this verse. For in the Catalogue he seems carefully\r\nto avoid repeating the general Greek appellatives in connection with\r\nthe inhabitants of particular places, and to give them local and\r\nspecial names only. It follows irresistibly, that therefore he must\r\nbe understood here to speak of the distinct race and local name of\r\nAchæans: to which race and name would naturally belong any settlers\r\nbrought by Pelops into Southern Greece.\r\n\r\nAnd, as Homer does not discontinue altogether the application of the\r\nArgeian name to the inhabitants of Argolis, he probably in this place\r\nmeans to distinguish Achæans not only from other Greek races, but even\r\nfrom other subjects of Tydeus and of Diomed, who would most properly be\r\ncalled Argeians.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears, that twice in the Catalogue Homer has occasion to use\r\nthe Achæan name locally, and in its original or, so to speak, gentile\r\nsense. And accordingly he has been careful not to risk confusion by\r\nemploying it in its wider signification either at the commencement of\r\nthe Catalogue or at the close. In both cases he uses the word Δαναοί;\r\nthe only one of his great appellatives which nowhere takes a local or\r\notherwise varied meaning. When he begins he invites the Muse to tell\r\nhim, v. 487,\r\n\r\n    οἵτινες ἡγεμόνες Δαναῶν καὶ κοίρανοι ἦσαν.\r\n\r\nSo also at the close, v. 760, he sums up in these words,\r\n\r\n    οὗτοι ἀρ’ ἡγεμόνες Δαναῶν καὶ κοίρανοι ἦσαν.\r\n\r\n5. As Nestor applies the Achæan name to the inhabitants of Pylos, so\r\nfrom the time of the Pelopid sway it becomes applicable to those of\r\nEastern Peloponnesus generally, in a sense wider than that of Il. ii.\r\n562, but yet narrower than the national one. In Il. iv. 384, and Il.\r\nv. 803, those, from among whom Tydeus set out for Thebes, are called\r\nἈχαιοί. So also in the colloquy with Glaucus, Diomed calls the comrades\r\nof his father on that occasion by the same name (Il. vi. 223). He\r\nrepeats the name in his prayer to Minerva, Il. x. 286, 7; and here he\r\nis careful to distinguish them from the Thebans of that epoch, who are\r\nΚαδμεῖοι (288).\r\n\r\n_The name Παναχαιοι._\r\n\r\n6. In further prosecution of the same subject, we have yet to consider\r\nthe force of the kindred Homeric word Παναχαιοί.\r\n\r\nThis is undoubtedly a term that challenges particular notice. No writer\r\nis so little wont as Homer to vary his expressions without a reason for\r\nit. But since the word Ἀχαιοὶ is used many hundred times as the simple\r\nequipollent of Greek, it cannot require the prefix παν to enable it\r\nto convey this sense effectually. Therefore to suppose that Παναχαιοὶ\r\nmeans Greeks and nothing more, would render the prefix unmeaning, and\r\nI conclude that such cannot be an adequate explanation of its purpose.\r\nBut if we construe the word as having a specific reference not only to\r\nthe aggregate, but to the parts of which it is made up, then the prefix\r\nπαν becomes abundantly charged with meaning. The word Παναχαιοὶ will in\r\nthis view mean what we should call ‘all classes of the Greeks,’ ‘the\r\nGreeks from the highest to the lowest.’\r\n\r\nIt is used, in all, eleven times. Of these eleven passages, seven times\r\nit appears in the expression ἀριστῆες Παναχαιῶν. Here the preceding\r\nword ἀριστῆες at once directs the mind to this notice of the different\r\nclasses, and receives much force from the distinctive particle παν: as\r\nwe may judge from the fact that Homer never but once (ἀριστῆες Δαναῶν,\r\nIl. xvii. 225) appends the appellative in its simple form to ἀριστῆες.\r\nThe prefix παν seems to strip the idea of conventionality, and to make\r\nit real: the chiefs are the pick and flower of the whole Greek array.\r\n\r\nOnly in one other passage of the Iliad do we find Παναχαιοί; it is in\r\nthe peroration of the speech of Ulysses to Achilles[734]:\r\n\r\n    εἰ δέ τοι Ἀτρείδης μὲν ἀπήχθετο κηρόθι μᾶλλον,\r\n    αὐτὸς καὶ τοῦ δῶρα, σὺ δ’ ἄλλους περ Παναχαιοὺς\r\n    τειρομένους ἐλέαιρε κατὰ στρατόν.\r\n\r\n‘Still, if you detest (the king) Atrides from your heart ever so\r\nmuch, him and his gifts, yet pity the Greeks throughout the army, now\r\nsuffering from the highest to the lowest.’ The force of the Παναχαιοὶ\r\nκατὰ στρατὸν is here very marked.\r\n\r\nLastly, in the Odyssey we find the line thrice repeated,\r\n\r\n    τῷ κέν οἱ τυμβὸν μὲν ἐποίησαν Παναχαιοί,\r\n\r\nand always in the same connection with the death of some select and\r\nbeloved hero of the army. Its obvious sense is, ‘all classes of the\r\nGreeks would have joined to do him honour, by lending a hand to raise\r\nhis funeral mound.’\r\n\r\nIn every one of these cases therefore the word Παναχαιοὶ seems to\r\nexpress the combination of all classes, and thus to point distinctly\r\nto the word Ἀχαιοὶ as capable of signifying something less than all\r\nclasses, namely, one, that is, the ruling class.\r\n\r\nThe construction thus put upon Παναχαιοὶ is in conformity with Homer’s\r\nusual mode of employing such words as the adjective πᾶς and the\r\npreposition σὺν in composition. We have previously seen the intensive\r\nforce of πᾶς in πᾶν Ἄργος and Πανέλληνες. And πᾶς itself receives\r\nadditional power from σύν. As in Il. i., where Achilles, having just\r\nbefore reminded Calchas of his office as Seer to the Δαναοὶ, proceeds\r\nto assure him that no one of the Greeks shall hurt him for doing his\r\nduty, it is now no one, not of the Δαναοὶ merely, but of the σύμπαντες\r\nΔαναοί; no, not even if he name Agamemnon himself as the guilty\r\nperson[735].\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to point out how accurately all this coincides\r\nwith the general results to which we have been already led. According\r\nto these, the bulk of the Greeks were a Pelasgian population, under the\r\nsway of ruling tribes and families, belonging to another race; among\r\nwhich the most powerful were those belonging to the Achæan stock; and\r\nwhose Argeian name was etymologically, and perhaps practically, a sort\r\nof substitute for the older Pelasgian one.\r\n\r\nNor is there difficulty in conceiving how, if the Achæans became the\r\ndominant race in the most important parts of Greece, they might,\r\nwithout constituting a numerical majority, give their name to the mass\r\nof the people, and to the country itself, as Britain and Britons became\r\nEngland and English from the Angles, or as Lombardy took its name from\r\nthe Lombards, and, unhappily, European Turkey, once the civil head of\r\nChristendom, from the Turks.\r\n\r\n_The Æolid and Æolian names._\r\n\r\nIt has been customary to speak of the question whether Homer was\r\nan Æolian Greek: to give the Æolian name to the forms of the Greek\r\nlanguage prevailing in his time: and to describe the Achæans as a\r\nbranch of the Æolians. With certain exceptions, says Strabo[736], the\r\nÆolian name still prevails outside the Isthmus; and it also covered\r\nthe Peloponnesus, till a mixture took place. The Ionians from Attica\r\nhad occupied Ægialus; and when the Heraclids, with the Dorians, became\r\nmasters of many Peloponnesian cities, the Ionians were expelled in\r\ntheir turn ὑπὸ Ἀχαιῶν, Αἰολικοῦ ἔθνους, after which two ἔθνη only\r\nremained in Peloponnesus, the Æolian and the Dorian.\r\n\r\nAgain, as respects the _digamma_, Heyne[737] most justly observes\r\nthat it may much more justly be called Pelasgic than Æolic; since the\r\nÆolians, as far as we know, only retained it, after having found it\r\nin use with the Pelasgi. But in general, to those who ground their\r\njudgments on the Homeric text, the whole view of the relation of\r\nAchæans and Æolians, as it is commonly given, will appear a false\r\none. In the first place the Æolians as a nation or tribe are wholly\r\npost-Homeric: unless we are bold enough to find some modification of\r\ntheir name in the Αἴτωλοι. The Æolid families, indeed, of Homer have\r\nevidently a great position, which we shall further discuss[738]: but\r\nthey simply fall for the time under the general name of Achæans, as\r\nmuch as any other families, and more than families like the Æacidæ,\r\nwho were in close political relations with a race bearing a designation\r\nof its own, namely, the Myrmidons. This nowhere appears to have been\r\nthe case with the Æolians. On the contrary, the Neleids, though they\r\nwere of illegitimate birth, may perhaps be considered as belonging\r\nto the Æolidæ; but their subjects actually bore the name of Achæans,\r\nbesides their territorial name of Pylians[739]. With respect to the\r\nepoch of the _Troica_, instead of calling the Achæans an Æolic race, it\r\nwould be more reasonable to call the Æolids (as there was nothing more\r\nextensive than a patronymic connected with that name) Achæan houses. I\r\ndo not however mean that they were properly such: for the Æolid name\r\nappears in Southern Greece before the Achæan, and was probably an older\r\nbranch from the same trunk.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent prevalence of the Æolian as compared with the Achæan\r\nname, (the Hellenic, however, overlying and soon absorbing both,)\r\nappears to point to one of two suppositions. Either there was an\r\noriginal Æolian tribe, which has escaped notice altogether in Homer,\r\nas the Dorians have all but escaped it: or else, and more probably,\r\nit may have happened that part at least of these Æolian houses held\r\ntheir ground in Greece, while the Achæan name, which had been elevated\r\nby the political predominance of the Pelopid sovereigns, collapsed\r\nupon the loss of that predominance. It was to be expected that the\r\nname should share in the downfall of the race, when the Heraclid and\r\nDorian invasion expelled the bearers of it from the seat of their\r\npower, and reduced them first to be fugitives, and then to settle in\r\na mere strip of the Peloponnesus; a single region of narrow scope,\r\nand, as is remarked by Polybius[740] after many centuries, of small\r\nweight and influence, which from them was called Achæa. The fact that\r\nthe Dorian name is all but unknown to Homer, while the Achæan one is\r\nat its zenith, not only heroically, as in the Iliad, but in the every\r\nday familiar use of Ithaca throughout the Odyssey, is to me one of\r\nseveral strong presumptions, not countervailed by any evidence of equal\r\nstrength, that Homer could not have lived to see that great revolution,\r\nwhich so completely effaced the ethnical landmarks, and altered the\r\ncondition, of Southern Greece.\r\n\r\n_The Heraclids in Homer._\r\n\r\nThere is certainly a striking analogy between the relation of the Æolid\r\nhouses named in Homer to the afterwards prevalent and powerful Æolian\r\nrace, and that of the Heraclid families, also named by him, to the\r\nDorian race, which in like manner grew from obscurity in the Homeric\r\nperiod to such great after-celebrity. Hercules himself appears before\r\nus in the ancient legend as the great Dorian hero, ‘everywhere paving\r\nthe road for his people and their worship, and protecting them from\r\nother races[741].’ The only Heraclids mentioned nominally by Homer are\r\nTlepolemus, Pheidippus, Antiphus; and there are others without names\r\nspecified[742]; none of these, or of the Greeks of the expedition, are\r\ncalled Dorians, while, again, none of the Heraclids of Homer are called\r\nby the Achæan or Æolid names. They may have been Dorian houses, like\r\nthe Æolid houses; and the name may have become tribal afterwards, when\r\nthey rose to power. The tradition of the reception of certain Heraclids\r\nin Attica appears to have been recognised by the Lacedæmonians in\r\nthe historic ages[743], and in the supposition of a friendship thus\r\nestablished, we may perhaps find the true explanation of the Decelean\r\nprivilege mentioned by Herodotus[744].\r\n\r\nIn arranging chronologically the Danaan, Argeian, and Achæan names of\r\nHomer, we give the first place to Danaan, and the next to Argeian, so\r\nas to bring the Danaans nearest to the Pelasgi. But the real meaning of\r\nthis is simply that the three names were suggested to Homer by three\r\nperiods of Greek history, which stand in the order given to the names.\r\nIf, however, instead of tracing the purpose of the Poet, we are to look\r\nfor ethnical history, then we must state that the Danaan name does not\r\ndenote a change of race, but it is a mere foreign affix to the closing\r\nportion of the Pelasgian period. Nor does the Argeian name, if we\r\nsuppose it to have been a sort of translation or reconstruction of the\r\nPelasgian, directly indicate the Hellenic infusion; but the mere fact\r\nof its substitution for a preceding appellation appears to presuppose a\r\ncause. Homer, indeed, gives us no Greek stories of the Danaid period,\r\nso that we do not certainly know that he might not have described the\r\nGreeks of that period also as Argeian. All we can say positively is,\r\nthat his use of the Argeian name _de facto_ begins with the epoch of\r\nthe first Hellenic throne in Greece, that of the Perseids. I hope to\r\nshow that the Achæan name and that of Perseus belong in truth to the\r\nsame stock and origin[745]: but it is with the Pelopids only that the\r\nAchæan name appears, and it denotes the second stage of the Hellenic\r\npreponderance, as the Argeian name marks the first, and the Dorian the\r\nthird. The first, or Argeian, stage belongs partly, as I believe, to\r\nthe house of Perseus, but partly, as is clear from the Homeric text,\r\nto the houses descended from Æolus.\r\n\r\n_Descent of the Æolids._\r\n\r\nÆolus himself is nowhere mentioned in Homer. The oldest Αἰολίδαι given\r\nto us as such are Sisyphus and Cretheus. The patronymic does not of\r\nitself enable us to determine whether these were sons of Æolus, or were\r\nmore remotely descended from him. But indirectly we may perhaps be\r\nenabled to fix his date, as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Bellerophon the grandson of Sisyphus[746], is called by the\r\ncontemporary Lycian king, the offspring of the deity, that is, of\r\nJupiter:\r\n\r\n    γίγνωσκε θεοῦ γόνον ἠῢν ἐόντα[747].\r\n\r\nThe meaning of this can only be that the person, whom Homer has\r\nindicated as the founder of the race, namely Æolus, was a reputed son\r\nof Jupiter.\r\n\r\n2. In the Νεκυΐα of the Eleventh Odyssey we are introduced to Tyro, the\r\ndaughter of Salmoneus, and the wife of Cretheus[748]. She is decorated\r\nwith the epithet εὐπατέρεια, never given elsewhere by Homer except to\r\nHelen, and apparently an equivalent with him for Διὸς ἐκγεγαυῖα.\r\n\r\nIt is by no means unlikely, I would venture to suggest, that a similar\r\nforce may lie in the epithet Salmoneus, who is here called ἀμύμων.\r\nThat epithet is indeed sometimes applied on the ground of personal\r\ncharacter. But Homer also gives it to the villain Ægisthus, which\r\nappears quite inexplicable except on the ground of the divine descent\r\nof the Pelopids[749]. The later tradition has loaded Salmoneus with\r\nthe crime of audacious profanity: and it has also, beginning with\r\nHesiod[750], made him a son of Æolus. The word ἀμύμων, combined with\r\nthe εὐπατέρεια of Tyro, leaves little room for doubt that perhaps both,\r\nand certainly the latter of these representations are agreeable to the\r\nsense of Homer. If so, then Tyro was a granddaughter of Æolus; and we\r\ncan at once fix his date from Homer, as follows:\r\n\r\n  1. Æolus.\r\n  2. Salmoneus, Od. xi. 235-7.\r\n  3. Tyro = Cretheus, ibid.\r\n  4. Pheres, Od. xi. 259.\r\n  5. Admetus, Il. ii. 711-15, 763.\r\n  6. Eumelus, ibid. and Od. iv. 798.\r\n\r\nFrom which last cited passage I set down Eumelus as the contemporary\r\nof his brother-in-law Ulysses, and half a generation senior to the\r\nstandard age of the war.\r\n\r\nWe have also the collateral line of Sisyphus from Æolus as follows: 1.\r\nSisyphus; 2. Glaucus (1); 3. Bellerophon; 4. Hippolochus; 5. Glaucus\r\n(2), contemporary with the war[751]. According to this table Sisyphus\r\nmight be either the son or the grandson of Æolus.\r\n\r\nAnd again, Cretheus, who like Sisyphus is Αἰολίδης, may have been\r\neither the uncle or the cousin of his wife Tyro. The Fragment of Hesiod\r\nwould make both him and Sisyphus sons of Æolus, and therefore uncles to\r\nTyro.\r\n\r\nThese genealogies are in perfect keeping with what Homer tells us of\r\nthe Neleid line. Tyro, he says, fell in love with Enipeus. In the\r\nlikeness of that river, Neptune had access to her, and she bore to\r\nhim two sons, Pelias and Neleus. Neleus is the father of Nestor: and\r\nNestor stands one generation senior to Eumelus; for he was in his third\r\ntri-decadal period[752], if the expression may be allowed, during the\r\naction of the Iliad. Thus we have (as before), 3. Tyro; 4. Neleus; 5.\r\nNestor; 6. Nestor. The maternal genealogy of Eumelus brings us exactly\r\nto the same point: for Alcestis, the daughter of Pelias, was married to\r\nhis father Admetus[753].\r\n\r\nThus the Æolid genealogies are laid down by Homer with great clearness,\r\nexcept as to the first interval, and with a singular self-consistency.\r\nPerseus[754], as we have seen, belongs to the fifth generation before\r\nthe war. This is nearly the same with Sisyphus, and with Cretheus: and\r\nwe are thus enabled to determine with tolerable certainty the epoch of\r\nthe first Hellenic infusion into Greece. It precedes the arrival of\r\nPortheus in Ætolia by one generation, and that of Pelops by two.\r\n\r\nOf Sisyphus we know from Homer, that he lived at an Ephyre on or near\r\nthe Isthmus of Corinth. It is not so clear whether Cretheus ever came\r\ninto the Peloponnesus. There is an Enipeus of Elis: but there is also\r\none[755] of Thessaly, which was doubtless its original. The name,\r\nhowever, of the Thessalian stream appears to have been written Eniseus.\r\nNitzsch[756] determines, on insufficient grounds as far as I can judge,\r\nthat the passage of Od. xi. cannot mean the Enipeus of Pisatis. I can\r\nfind no conclusive evidence either way: but Sisyphus was certainly in\r\nSouthern Greece at or before this time, so that we need not wonder\r\nif Cretheus, another Æolid, was there also. His reputed son Neleus\r\nfounded, without doubt, the kingdom of Pylos. Post-Homeric tradition\r\nplaces even Salmoneus, the father of Tyro, in Elis.\r\n\r\n_Earliest Hellenic thrones in Greece._\r\n\r\nWe have now before us an outline of the first entrance of Hellic\r\nelements into Greece, south of Thessaly. It seems to have been effected\r\nby five families;\r\n\r\n1. The house of Perseus.\r\n\r\n2. That of Sisyphus.\r\n\r\n3. The illegitimate line of Cretheus, or the Neleids.\r\n\r\n4. Probably the legitimate line of Salmoneus, represented in Augeas.\r\n\r\n5. Next to these will come Portheus, the head of the Œneidæ in Ætolia:\r\nand only then follows the great house of the Pelopids, not alone, but\r\nin conjunction with a race, to whose history we now must turn.\r\n\r\nOf the Danaid and Perseid princes we have no reason to suppose, that\r\nthey enjoyed the extended power which was wielded by Agamemnon. Not\r\nonly would they appear to have been circumscribed, latterly at least,\r\nby the Minoan empire founded in Crete, but Homer gives us no intimation\r\nthat their dominion at any time included the possession of a supremacy\r\nover a number of subordinate princes beyond their own immediate\r\nborders, or reached beyond the territory which may be generally\r\ndescribed as the Eastern Peloponnesus.\r\n\r\nA direct inference bearing on this subject may be obtained from the\r\npassage concerning the sceptre of Agamemnon[757]: for the Pelopids do\r\nnot succeed to that of Eurystheus and the Perseids, but they hold from\r\nJupiter: which seems to imply that they acquired much more, than had\r\nbeen under the sway of their predecessors. Probably therefore we shall\r\ndo well to conclude that Eurystheus, for example, had a limited realm,\r\nand that by land only: Agamemnon, a certain supremacy by land and sea,\r\nwithin the range of which the old Minoan empire had now fallen. Still\r\nthe kingdom of Eurystheus was probably in its own day the greatest, and\r\nwas also probably the oldest, of all properly Hellenic kingdoms.\r\n\r\nIf, then, neither of the prior dynasties of Danaus and Perseus reigned\r\nover all Greece, it is unlikely that either of them could give a name\r\nto the whole nation: though they might give a name to the part of\r\nthe country which, having in their time been particularly famous and\r\npowerful, became under the Pelopids a metropolis, supreme throughout\r\nthe rest of the country; and whose people then not only took the name\r\nof Ἀχαιοὶ for itself, but extended it over the whole of Greece.\r\n\r\n_Use of the Danaan and Argeian names poetical._\r\n\r\nIt is thus more than probable that the scope of the name Danai, (if\r\nwe are to assume that it was then a name in actual use,) under the\r\nDanaids, and of the name Ἀργεῖοι under the Perseids, was local, and\r\nconfined in the main to Eastern Peloponnesus, where those princes\r\nruled; with the addition of any other parts of the country, over which\r\nthey might for the time have extended their power. And if so, then\r\nwe have to suppose that Homer, having received the traditions of the\r\nDanaan and Argeian princes as having been at the head in their own time\r\nof Greek history or legend, gave to the nation by way of a poetical\r\nname, but of a poetical name only, the appellation which their subjects\r\nrespectively had borne, and which had never before been, and never\r\nbecame by any other title than his poetical authority, applicable to\r\nall the Greeks.\r\n\r\nThe Achæan name, on the other hand, differs from these, first, in\r\ndenoting the extension of a particular race, though not over the whole\r\ncountry, yet through very many of its parts, and secondly, in the\r\nfact that the ruling house of those who bore the name enjoyed a real\r\npolitical supremacy over both the continent and the islands. So that it\r\nbecame the most legitimate exponent of Greek nationality, until it had\r\nlost both its extension and its power; the one by compression of its\r\nprincipal tribes into a narrow space: the other by the transfer of its\r\npolitical prerogatives to the great Dorian family of the Spartan kings,\r\nafter the conquest of the Heraclidæ.\r\n\r\nWhen the Achæans had ceased to predominate, there could be no reason\r\nwhy their name should remain stamped upon their brethren, who boasted\r\nof the same descent, and who had attained to greater force.\r\n\r\nAs in the Homeric times, while the Achæans were the leaders of Greece,\r\nthey might claim to represent the whole Hellenic stock, so, when the\r\nDorians had dethroned them and occupied the seat of power, when the\r\nÆolian name was widely diffused, and, again, when Athens with its mixed\r\nrace became great, and claimed, along with its vaunts of antiquity and\r\ncontinuity, to pass over, as Herodotus says, to the Hellenic class,\r\nbut without an Achæan descent, then the Achæan name could no longer\r\nadequately represent the title to nationality, and the various races\r\nnaturally fell back on the designation which gave no exclusive right\r\nor preeminence to any of them, and which they were all entitled to\r\nenjoy in common. They apparently however chose to be connected with the\r\nrich plains of Thessaly, where they first learned civilization, and\r\norganized their collective or national life, rather than with the rude\r\nand coarse manners of their more remote ancestors in the hills. They\r\nwere therefore not Helli, but Hellenes.\r\n\r\nThis may be considered as the _rationale_ of the common and palpably\r\nmanufactured tradition respecting Hellen and his family, of which we\r\nhave the earliest form in Hesiod.\r\n\r\n_Summary of the Evidence._\r\n\r\nOur conclusions respecting the names by which Homer describes the\r\ninhabitants of Greece may now be summed up as follows:\r\n\r\n1. We set out from the point at which Greece is, probably for the first\r\ntime, settled by a race given to tillage and pacific habits, under\r\nthe general name of Pelasgians, with subdivision under minor names of\r\nparticular tribes, or partially and locally intermixed with fragments\r\nof other races.\r\n\r\n2. A dynasty of foreign origin, in a portion of Greece which then\r\nbecame, and ever after continued to be most famous, leads the march of\r\nevents; and, apparently without displacing the Pelasgians themselves,\r\nyet seems to have displaced, in a certain quarter, the Pelasgic by\r\nthe Danaan name; at any rate, it attains to such celebrity, that its\r\nhistory, in the eye of Homer, fills the whole breadth of its own epoch,\r\nand its name stands in after time, poetically at least, for a national\r\ntitle.\r\n\r\n3. An Hellenic dynasty of Perseids, belonging to the Greek Peninsula,\r\nfollows this dynasty; and, effacing the trace of foreign rule, governs\r\nits subjects under the Argeian or Argive name; which, without reviving\r\nthe title of the Pelasgi, a word now becoming or become subordinate,\r\nyet like that title is founded on the physical character of the regions\r\nin which the population was settled, and upon the employments suited\r\nthereto.\r\n\r\n4. Next appears upon the scene the Achæan name, which bears no mark of\r\nrelationship to the soil, or to any particular employment, or to any\r\nparticular eponymist, but appears to be the designation of a race, not\r\nindeed foreign, yet new to the Peloponnesus.\r\n\r\n5. A warlike and highly gifted race gradually pervade different parts\r\nof Greece under this name: the Pelopids, its ruling family, possessing\r\nthemselves of the throne of the Perseids, attain, perhaps through the\r\nextended sympathy of Achæan blood, to a national supremacy. The Achæans\r\nare, in fact, become the Greeks of the Troic age. They include Æolids\r\nand Æacids, Argives, Bœotians, Ætolians, Epeans, Abantes, Dorians,\r\nArcadians, Ionians, and all the other local tribes, as well as the mass\r\nof old Pelasgians, who constitute the working population (so to speak)\r\nof the country; some of them by virtue of blood, and the rest by that\r\npolitical union, in which the Achæans had an undisputed ascendancy.\r\n\r\n6. All the characteristics of this race, social and religious, and its\r\nclose geographical proximity to, if not indeed its identity with, the\r\nfirst-named or Myrmidon Hellenes of Homer, appear to derive it from the\r\nNorth, to dissociate it from the Pelasgic, and to unite it with the\r\nHellic stock.\r\n\r\n7. Time passes on; we lose the guiding hand of Homer; but universal\r\ntradition assures us that the Dorians, emerging, like those who had\r\npreceded them, from the cradle of the nation, lead another and the last\r\ngreat Hellenic migration southward; the Pelopids are driven from the\r\nthrone of that which may be termed the metropolitan region of Greece;\r\nthey migrate to an inferior seat, with their followers, and become the\r\nobscure heads of a secondary State: and the name of Hellenes, belonging\r\nto all the great Greek tribes in common, whether of Achæan, Æolid, or\r\nDorian blood or connection, becomes the grand historical designation of\r\nthe nation at large.\r\n\r\n8. After perhaps eight hundred years of fame and freedom for Hellas,\r\nthe iron hand of Roman power descends upon her at a time when the old\r\nAchæan name has revived by means of a democratic confederacy, and has\r\nonce more overspread[758] the Peloponnesus. From this time, Hellas\r\ntakes her place in history only as a minor portion of the Roman empire,\r\neven while, by an inward process, she is asserting her intellectual\r\nsupremacy[759], and moulding the literature and philosophy of her\r\nconquerors. But to them politically she is no more than an appendage of\r\nthe _Magna Græcia_, whose glory it is to be a part of imperial Italy,\r\nand whose name the land of Homer’s song must now assume in virtue of a\r\ndouble relationship; the first, that of their common social base, the\r\nold Pelasgi, of whom the Greeks (Γραïκοὶ) were probably a part; and the\r\nsecond, that of a more recent colonization. Thus the Graic or Greek\r\nname, having existed, but never having emerged to what may be called\r\nvisibility in Hellas, travels round to it again by the route of Italy,\r\nand finally becomes predominant in this its earliest seat.\r\n\r\nOf this intermixture and succession of names dependent on the fusion of\r\nraces, and on political supremacy, we have sufficient example in our\r\nown island. It has been inhabited by Britons, Romans, Angles, Saxons,\r\nJutes, Danes, and Normans. All came more or less as conquerors, one\r\nfollowing upon the other. But two names only have left their mark,\r\nBritons and Angles: all the others, including the last or Norman\r\nconquerors, are submerged. So it has been with the succession of\r\nPelasgians, Achæans, Hellenes, Greeks. Each of these names historically\r\nsuperseded the one before it. Apart from them, by the high privilege\r\nof Poetry, stand their names in another combination: the Iliad\r\nand Odyssey shew us Danaans, Argeians, and Achæans, as in the main\r\nsynonymous before Troy: yet each with its own leaning, which makes\r\nΔαναοὶ most properly and by preference ‘the soldiery,’ Ἀργεῖοι, ‘the\r\nmasses,’ and Ἀχαιοὶ, ‘the chiefs.’\r\n\r\nIt still remains to observe the immediately subsequent literary history\r\nof these three great appellatives, which the _fiat_ of Homer made so\r\nfamous.\r\n\r\nHesiod and the minor Greek poets afford us the only satisfactory\r\nillustration of actual usage, because the tragedians may probably have\r\nsought, in treating heroic subjects, to employ the nomenclature of the\r\nheroic age. The other poets spoke, of course, according to their own\r\nrespective ages.\r\n\r\nIn Hesiod we do not find Δαναοὶ at all: Ἀργεῖος only in the singular\r\nfor Juno: Ἀχαιοὶ is once used for the Greeks collectively, in a\r\nretrospective passage referring to the assembly at Aulis[760]. He uses\r\nΠανέλληνες[761] in the same poem with the same sense. An important\r\npassage of Strabo[762] testifies, that both Hesiod and Archilochus were\r\nacquainted with the use of the names Ἕλληνες and Πανέλληνες for the\r\nGreeks at large; and refers to works of theirs, now lost, by way of\r\nexample as to the latter term. Both Ἕλλας and Ἕλληνες are freely used\r\nin Simonides, who also has Ἀργεῖοι for the Argives only. And generally\r\nthese old writers, coming next after Hesiod, knew nothing of the use of\r\nἈργεῖοι, or even of Ἀχαιοὶ, for the whole nation, while the word Δαναοὶ\r\nis not found in them at all.\r\n\r\nThis is strongly confirmatory, as it appears to me, of the propositions\r\nI have endeavoured to establish.\r\n\r\nAmong the tragedians the name Ἀχαιὸς, with its derivatives, used to\r\nsome extent by Æschylus, progressively declines: the Danaan name holds\r\nits ground rather better, and Ἀργεῖος better still; though all are\r\neclipsed by the great historical name of Hellenes, which probably had\r\nenjoyed an undisputed prevalence from the time of the Dorian conquest.\r\nThus, for poetical use, dealing with the events and characters of the\r\nheroic age, they properly fall back upon the names which Homer employed.\r\n\r\n_Its value as primitive history._\r\n\r\nFrom these successions of name, whether the particular appellation be\r\nfounded upon lineage or upon physical incidents, it is not unreasonable\r\nto hold that we may draw the outlines of a primitive history, at least\r\nwith more confidence and satisfaction than by efforts to compound and\r\npiece together the miscellaneous and promiscuous traditions of many\r\nages and places, set wide apart from one another; in respect to which,\r\neven where we have not to lament the gnawing power of Time, we, at\r\nleast, know that the faculties both of exaggeration and of invention,\r\nstimulated by vanity, rivalry, and self-interest in many other forms,\r\nhave been at work. It is better to deal with slighter relics, of which\r\nwe know the _bona fides_, than with an abundance of such as have been\r\nfalsified. Besides, when we have effectually exhausted the power of\r\nthe first, we may much more profitably use the subsidiary lights which\r\nthe second will afford us. And the tendency of an attempt to invest\r\nthe Homeric text with an unequivocal supremacy, is to substitute for\r\ncomplete and symmetrical systems, in which the hewn stone and the trash\r\nare not distinguishable one from another, very slight and partial\r\nindeed, but yet authoritative fragments and outlines, all the intervals\r\nof which are filled up by avowed conjecture. This conjecture is\r\nwithout a pretence to authority properly so called, but it is, at any\r\nrate, both kept visibly apart from what is authoritative, and likewise\r\nfounded upon the suggestions which even fragmentary testimony, when\r\ngenuine and near the source, is well qualified to make.\r\n\r\nAnd the succession of names is in effect of itself almost a political\r\nhistory. For the names of nations are not arbitrarily changed, though\r\nsuch things have been done to particular cities within the dominion of\r\nparticular states. The names of races, especially of races disposed,\r\nlike the Greeks, to knit themselves closely with the past, are\r\ncherished as a material portion of their patrimony. When they alter,\r\nit is for some great and commanding political reason. Such as, for\r\nexample, if some tribe or family, previously not advanced beyond its\r\nfellows, in some great national exigency becomes invested with the\r\nresponsibility of acting for the whole body, and thus grows to be as\r\nwell its representative and organ in all external relations, as also\r\nthe representative of its inward life: or when some conquering dynasty\r\nand host have by the strong hand entered in upon prior occupants of\r\nthe soil, and, reducing them to dependence or to servitude more or\r\nless qualified, or narrowing the circle of their possessions, have\r\ntaken into their own custody, together with the best lands of the\r\ncountry, the whole range of public affairs, and have imposed laws\r\nupon the vanquished, and imparted to them manners. In this case, the\r\ndifferent elements are welded into a political unity, by a power\r\nproceeding from that race which among them has possessed the greater\r\nphysical and martial force. But unless there be more than the merely\r\nconvulsive effort of conquest, unless deep roots be struck into the\r\nsoil, and sharper furrows drawn upon it than the spear alone can\r\ncarve, or than the wave of a mere deluge traces, unless, in a word,\r\nthere be a predominant organizing faculty, the effect will not be\r\npermanent; and the crude mass of mere strength will sink down amid the\r\nsurrounding milder, but more enduring and more prevailing impulses.\r\nIn some instances it has been so: the body, which has been stronger\r\nin the hand, has proved weaker in the intellectual and moral, that\r\nis to say, the enduring, elements of power. The undying yet daily\r\ninfluences and sympathies of peace wear down the convulsive vibrations,\r\nwhich the shock of war and conquest have communicated to the social\r\nfabric. Victory must end in possession, like toil in sleep. Possession\r\nimplies the dispersion of the conquerors, and, in such cases as these,\r\ntheir free intermixture with the vanquished. Ties of neighbourhood,\r\nof commerce, of marriage, ties belonging to all the transactions of\r\nlife, are gradually multiplied between the new comers and the old;\r\nand by a gentle process, experience and opinion gradually decide, not\r\nimperiously in the spirit of party, but insensibly for the benefit of\r\nall, what laws, what manners, what language[763], what religion shall\r\npredominate. The fate of the name follows that of the institutions and\r\nhabits with which it was connected; and the old designation prevails\r\nultimately over the new, or the new over the old, in proportion as the\r\nolder inhabitants have contributed a larger or a smaller share towards\r\nthe common national life resulting from the combination; in proportion\r\nas the newly arrived receive more of impression than they impart, or\r\nimpart more than they receive.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[613] Strabo, pp. 372, 383.\r\n\r\n[614] Il. ii. 494. xiii. 685. vid. sup. p. 243.\r\n\r\n[615] Il. iv. 385. 191.\r\n\r\n[616] Il. xi. 670-761.\r\n\r\n[617] v. 759.\r\n\r\n[618] Inf. p. 392.\r\n\r\n[619] Od. iv. 184, 296.\r\n\r\n[620] See inf. sect. ix.\r\n\r\n[621] Il. vi. 292.

IX.\r\n\r\n_On the Homeric title ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Difference between Epithets and Titles._\r\n\r\nBoth in modern society, and in the forms of modern language, the\r\ndistinction is a familiar one, which separates between descriptive\r\naffixes or epithets, and titles properly so called.\r\n\r\nA descriptive affix, be it substantive, like Δαναοὶ αἰχμηταὶ, or\r\nadjective, like Δαναοὶ φιλοπτόλεμοι, describes a quality, and\r\nchallenges from the reader, like any other phrase conveying an idea,\r\nassent to the justice of its description. These descriptive affixes\r\nhave a tendency, from repeated use, to grow into _formulæ_, and then at\r\nlength they approximate to the nature of titles.\r\n\r\nBut a title is quite a different thing from a descriptive affix. A\r\ntitle is the current coin of language, which is intended to pass from\r\nmouth to mouth without examination. It is like a pronoun, having for\r\nits office simply to indicate, or to stand for, a particular person. It\r\nis the index of a rank or office, a thing determinate in its nature,\r\nlike an unit of number: and it has no relation, when once fixed as a\r\ntitle, to personal character, though in its origin it may have been\r\nfounded on the real or presumed existence of personal qualities. Like a\r\ndescriptive affix, a title may be either adjective, as ‘most noble,’ or\r\nsubstantive, as ‘marquis.’\r\n\r\nTitles evidently presume a certain progress in the organization of\r\npolitical society; while descriptive epithets must be used, in order to\r\nmeet the purposes of human speech, even in its first stages.\r\n\r\nThis degree of progress must have been attained in the time of Homer;\r\nfor the use of titles in the poems, as well as of descriptive\r\nepithets, can be clearly made out.\r\n\r\nAmong the descriptive epithets of Homer we find, of substantives,\r\nἡγεμόνες, ἀριστῆες, and also βασιλεῖς, ἀοιδοί. Of adjectives, applied\r\nto classes, σκηπτοῦχοι (βασιλῆες), ὑπερμενέες (βασιλῆες), θεῖοι\r\n(ἀοιδοί): and applied to persons, ἐχεφρὼν Πηνελόπεια, Τηλέμαχος\r\nπεπνυμένος, πολύμητις Ὀδύσσευς: and many more.\r\n\r\nIn modern phraseology, duke, earl, baron, knight, esquire, are titles:\r\nnobles, clergy, freeholders, burgesses, are descriptive phrases. Of a\r\ndescriptive epithet or affix which has grown to be a title, we may find\r\ninstances among those just cited; knight (_knecht_) meant originally\r\na servant, then a person performing particular service to the king;\r\nand esquire (_scudiero_, _écuyer_) meant a person who bore the arms\r\nof a knight, particularly his shield. In process of time these became\r\ntitles. Again, words may hang doubtfully upon the confine between title\r\nand epithet; as the much criticised expressions of the English Common\r\nPrayer Book, ‘(our) most religious and gracious (king).’\r\n\r\nWe find in Homer that the word βασιλεὺς, a king, had already begun to\r\npass from the function of a mere descriptive word towards that of a\r\ntitle; for, though rarely, he attaches it to the names of individuals,\r\nbesides freely using it without them; and it is an usual note of\r\ntitles properly so called, that they can, even if substantives, either\r\nbe combined with the name of the person, or, in addressing them,\r\nsubstituted for it. In the Iliad we find Ἀλεξάνδρῳ βασιλῆι, and in the\r\nOdyssey Ἔχετον βασιλῆα. Again, we find βασίλεια used in the Odyssey in\r\nthe vocative[764], which in like manner marks it as a title.\r\n\r\nThe word ἄναξ, again, in Homer, which must on no account be confounded\r\nwith βασιλεὺς[765], is commonly a descriptive epithet, nearly\r\nequivalent to our word _lord_, and, like it, having an extraordinary\r\nelasticity of sense; for as a person may now be lord, so he might then\r\nbe ἄναξ, of a kingdom, a people, a field, a mine, a slave, a horse,\r\nor a dog. Instances are countless. Sometimes the meaning is lord, or\r\nmaster, relatively to a particular object, as of the horses of Nestor,\r\n\r\n    οἱ δὲ ἄνακτος ὑποδδείσαντες ὁμοκλὴν....[766]\r\n\r\nSometimes it means in the abstract a class of persons,\r\n\r\n    οἷοί τε ἀνάκτων παῖδες ἔασιν.[767]\r\n\r\nwhere the ἀνάκτων παῖδες nearly corresponds with our ‘children of the\r\nhigher orders,’ i.e. the masters of slaves.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in reference to the immortals, ἄναξ is sometimes a\r\ntitle: as in Il. xvi. 233,\r\n\r\n    Ζεῦ ἄνα, Δωδώναιε, Πελασγικέ.\r\n\r\n_Examples of titles._\r\n\r\nThere are, however, in Homer various words which are undoubtedly and\r\nuniformly titular. Such are in particular the adjectives Διοτρεφὴς\r\nand Διογενὴς, which are very nearly equivalent in power to the phrase\r\n‘Royal Highness’ of the present day. They commonly accompany the name\r\nof the individual, or of the class, to which they belong: and they are\r\nconfined, with one single exception, in the Iliad, to persons of the\r\nhighest known rank, that of βασιλεὺς or king. The exception is Phœnix,\r\nwho is in one place addressed by Achilles as γέραιε Διοτρεφές. But\r\nAchilles says this χαριζόμενος, when petting and coaxing the old man,\r\nand therefore the instance does not destroy the force of the general\r\nrule.\r\n\r\nIn one place we have ὁ Διογενὴς[768] used for Achilles in the third\r\nperson without his name: which still more strikingly marks the word\r\nas a title. Also Διοτρεφὴς is not unfrequently used in the vocative,\r\nwithout, as well as with, the name of the person to whom it is\r\naddressed. It may possibly be worth notice, that these words, Διοτρεφὴς\r\nand Διογενὴς, are never applied to Agamemnon, as if they had, again\r\nlike the phrase ‘Royal Highness,’ a limit upwards as well as downwards,\r\nand were not applicable to the supreme head of the nation. There is\r\nindeed one passage where Agamemnon is addressed as Διοτρεφὴς, but it is\r\nin the universally suspected[769] νεκυΐα of the Twenty-fourth Odyssey.\r\nPlainly this fact cannot be referred to metrical considerations, even\r\nas to Διοτρεφὴς, because either in the genitive, or in the vocative,\r\nit would easily have been made available: especially in the latter\r\ninflexion, for Agamemnon is addressed vocatively some five and twenty\r\ntimes in the poems. I admit that Ulysses may allude to him in the line,\r\n\r\n    θυμὸς δὲ μέγας ἐστὶ Διοτρεφέος βασιλῆος[770].\r\n\r\nBut the phrase here is more abstract than personal: it is perhaps as we\r\nshould say, ‘our royal master.’\r\n\r\nThe word βασιλεὺς may have borne originally a merely descriptive\r\ncharacter. But it has only partial traces of that character still\r\nadhering to it, as it is used in the Iliad. The chief note of such a\r\nsense, that I can find, is, that it is used in the comparative and\r\nsuperlative to distinguish the Pelopid house from the other kings.\r\nAgamemnon is βασιλεύτατος, Il. ix. 69, and Menelaus is evidently\r\nintended in the βασιλεύτερος of Il. x. 239; where Diomed is bidden to\r\nchoose the best man, irrespectively of rank, and not to tie himself to\r\nthe βασιλεύτερος.\r\n\r\nAs the Odyssey represents a period of political disorganization,\r\nbrought about by the long absence of the chiefs, it is not surprising\r\nthat we find the word βασιλεὺς, and its proper epithet Διοτρεφὴς, used\r\nin this poem with greater laxity. The βασιλῆες and the Διοτρεφεῖς[771],\r\nare here not the kings but the aristocracy of Scheria, and of the\r\ndominions of Ulysses: and it is a compliment paid to Telemachus by\r\nTheoclymenus, when he says[772],\r\n\r\n    ὑμετέρου δ’ οὐκ ἔστι γένος βασιλεύτερον ἄλλο\r\n    ἐν δημῷ Ἰθάκης.\r\n\r\nYet even here the special and official sense of βασιλεὺς remains: no\r\none is ever called individually a βασιλεὺς unless he is on the throne,\r\nthough Antinous is said to resemble one of the king-class,\r\n\r\n    βασιλῆι γὰρ ἀνδρὶ ἔοικας[773].\r\n\r\nAnd the same Antinous sarcastically expresses his hope, that Jupiter\r\nwill not make Telemachus βασιλεὺς in Ithaca, notwithstanding his right\r\nof succession by birth[774]. If βασιλεὺς only indicated a certain\r\nstation, Telemachus without doubt was βασιλεὺς already.\r\n\r\nThe sense proper to it in Homer is that in which, for some thousands of\r\nyears, it appears to have maintained a world-wide celebrity.\r\n\r\n_Common interpretations of ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν._\r\n\r\nAnd now as respects the constructions which have been put upon the\r\nphrase ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν. It is not noticed by Heyne or by Crusius. Of the\r\ntranslators I have already spoken. As regards the Lexicographers,\r\nScott and Liddell say ‘Agamemnon _as general-in-chief_ is specially\r\nἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, while Orsilochos is called ἄναξ ἄνδρεσσιν in Il. v.\r\n546;’ but the phrase is πολέεσσ’ ἄνδρεσσιν ἄνακτα, which I take to be\r\nsimply equivalent to ἀνάσσοντα, and to have no relation to a phrase or\r\n_formula_.\r\n\r\nDamm[775] says it indicates supreme dignity united with military\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nAgain; Mure[776] remarks, that in common with ποιμὴν λαῶν and κρείων,\r\n‘it denotes the office of any king or chieftain, but more particularly\r\nthat of a supreme ruler or commander.’\r\n\r\nThat these explanations are entirely beside the mark, I am convinced\r\nafter a somewhat minute consideration.\r\n\r\nIn answer to Damm, I would observe that the phrase was applied to\r\nÆneas, who was a commander, but not a sovereign: it was applied to\r\nAnchises, who was a sovereign, but not a commander; it was applied to\r\nEumelus, who was neither a sovereign, nor a warrior of any note, and\r\nwho commanded no more than eleven ships.\r\n\r\nIt does not then depend upon the highest degree either of military or\r\nof civil elevation.\r\n\r\nNor does it in all cases attach to divine descent, even though that\r\ndescent be from Jupiter; nor even if it be immediate or next to\r\nimmediate: as among the living, Sarpedon the son of Jupiter has it not,\r\nneither has Polypœtes his grandson (Il. ii. 740). So, among the dead,\r\nit is not given either to Hercules or to Rhadamanthus[777], sons of\r\nJupiter. If, as is probable, reputed extraction from Jupiter in all\r\ncases attached to it, it was a remote and not a near extraction, and\r\nthus the title was the ornament of an antique lineage; certainly divine\r\ndescent was not the immediate qualification for the particular dignity.\r\n\r\nI do not dispute, that an idea of divine descent attaches generally and\r\nimmediately to sovereigns as such, at least in the Iliad. But this is\r\nrepresented by the words Διοτρεφὴς and Διογενὴς, as they bear witness\r\nby their etymology, and not by ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν. Indeed we seem to find the\r\nword Διοτρεφὴς used for heaven-born, without reference to political\r\npower, in that line of the Odyssey (v. 378), where Neptune applies it\r\nto the Phæacians:\r\n\r\n    εἰσόκεν ἀνθρώποισι Διοτρεφέεσσι μιγείης.\r\n\r\nBut of those Homeric titles which are specifically Greek, by far the\r\nmost remarkable is the title of ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν.\r\n\r\n_Particulars of its use._\r\n\r\nIt is used by the Poet fifty-two times: fifty times in the Iliad, twice\r\nonly in the Odyssey.\r\n\r\nIt is applied forty-six times to Agamemnon, and six times to five other\r\npersons, once for each in four cases, and twice in one. The persons are,\r\n\r\n  Eumelus, a living Greek.\r\n\r\n  Augeias,  }\r\n            } dead Greeks.\r\n  Euphetes, }\r\n\r\n  Anchises, }\r\n            } living Trojans.\r\n  Æneas,    }\r\n\r\nIt appears and perishes with Homer, not being found in the writings of\r\nany other Greek author.\r\n\r\nIt is never used in any of the cases, except the nominative: never\r\nseparated from the proper name of the person to whom it is applied,\r\nexcept once (Il. i. 7), and then only by the particle τε: it always\r\nprecedes the name except in that single passage: it always ends with\r\nthe first half of the fifth foot of the verse, except in that same\r\npassage: and again, the word ἄναξ is never separated from the word\r\nἀνδρῶν, except once in the Odyssey by the word δέ.\r\n\r\nIt is applied to no person whose name does not begin with a vowel,\r\nand to no person whose name is not of the metrical value necessary\r\nto enable it to form the last foot and a half of the hexameter: as,\r\nAgamemnon, of two short syllables and two long ones; Euphetes, three\r\nlong ones; Eumelus, two long and one short. Circumstances, these last,\r\nwhich, if they stood alone, would raise a presumption that the use of\r\nit was determined by metrical considerations only.\r\n\r\nThat metrical considerations had some degree of influence on the use of\r\nphrases in Homer, we may sufficiently judge, by observing that while\r\nHomer uses the name of Achæans four times for that of Argeians once, he\r\nuses the forms Ἀχαίοισι and Ἀχαίοισιν but twelve times, whereas he uses\r\nἈργείοισι and Ἀργείοισιν more than sixty times.\r\n\r\nBut we may observe that no metrical considerations could have prevented\r\nHomer from applying the phrase to Diomedes, Polypœtes, or others, whose\r\nnames differ from that of Agamemnon only in having a consonant at the\r\nbeginning of them: and yet he has not done this: the names of all his\r\nsix ἄνακτες ἀνδρῶν begin with a vowel. Thus as he restrains himself\r\nbeyond what metre requires, he may have had some reason other than\r\nmetre to govern his use of the title.\r\n\r\nThe question is, whether there are, evidently or probably, other\r\nconditions of substance, which, besides these of sound, meet in the\r\npersons designated by the title, and which enable us to trace and fix\r\nits purport?\r\n\r\nWith reference to Mure’s explanation I observe, that it does not\r\nappear to take account of the difference between descriptive words in\r\ngeneral, and titles, as applicable to Homer; but rather to assume that\r\nthe Homeric phrases are simply of the former class.\r\n\r\nIt is plain that the word κρείων is a term of that class only: which,\r\n_pro tanto_, is indicated by its relationship to the established and\r\nordinary epithet of comparison κρείσσων. It clearly describes the class\r\nof those, who bore single-handed rule, in the address to Jupiter, ὕπατε\r\nκρειόντων[778]; and it answers to the epithet princely in Il. xxiv. 538.\r\n\r\n                          ὅττι οἱ οὔτι\r\n    Παίδων ἐν μεγάροισι γονὴ γένετο κρειόντων.\r\n\r\n    ‘For he had not as yet a princely offspring in his home.’\r\n\r\nLower than Βασιλεὺς, which corresponds to the rank implied by our term\r\n‘majesty,’ and less wide in sense than ἄναξ, which corresponds very\r\nnearly with ‘lord,’ it is generally the equivalent as to rank of prince\r\nor princely, according to the English sense of the terms; but it is in\r\nHomer always a descriptive word only, and never a title. Accordingly it\r\nis found in the later Greek writers, when both ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, and even\r\nποιμὴν λαῶν have disappeared.\r\n\r\n_The ποιμὴν λαῶν of Homer._\r\n\r\nThe phrase ποιμὴν λαῶν is more largely used than κρείων, and with\r\nmore appearance of approximation to that substantive character, and\r\nsusceptibility of individual application, which belongs to a title.\r\nThus in\r\n\r\n    Οἱ δ’ ἐπανέστησαν, πείθοντό τε ποιμένι λαῶν,\r\n    σκηπτοῦχοι βασιλῆες[779],\r\n\r\nthe βασιλῆες are the members of the Greek βουλὴ, and ποιμὴν λαῶν means\r\nAgamemnon. Like κρείων, it was applicable to those who held secondary\r\nsovereignties, the feudatories, so to speak, of the principal chiefs:\r\nas for instance, we find among the secondary commanders of the Pylian\r\ndivision,\r\n\r\n    Αἵμονά τε κρείοντα, Βίαντά τε, ποιμένα λαῶν[780].\r\n\r\nIt reaches down to persons, of whom we know and can infer nothing,\r\nbut that they may probably have held small fiefs (so to call them)\r\nwith derivative sovereignty of some kind, such as were, among the\r\nTrojans[781], Bienor, Hypeiron, Apisaon, Hypsenor: and it is also\r\napplied to the sons of the greater chiefs, for example, Thrasymedes and\r\nAgenor[782], as well as to the chiefs themselves, including Agamemnon.\r\nIt is likewise given to Ægisthus, when he was, _de facto_, in\r\npossession of the throne of Agamemnon[783]. It is therefore applicable\r\nto the idea of political rule in the very widest sense, differing\r\nhowever from ἄναξ in so far that, while it is assigned to personages of\r\nsmaller note politically, it is confined to the expression of that kind\r\nof superiority, and has nothing whatever to do with property.\r\n\r\nI find it, on the whole, impossible to detect in this phrase any thing\r\nof a definite character, except that it expresses political rule at\r\nlarge, and expresses it under the form of a figure adapted to the early\r\nand patriarchal state of society. I hesitate then to call it with\r\nconfidence a title, because the class to which it applies is somewhat\r\nindeterminate, and therefore it is wanting in specific meaning: yet it\r\nmay partake somewhat of that character. We must, however, distinguish\r\nbroadly between the element of subordination to Agamemnon, such as we\r\nsee it in Nestor and Diomed, and that of the class to which the lower\r\nποιμένες λαῶν belonged. These were as widely separated as the great\r\nfeudatories of mediæval France, from the petty lords who so much\r\nabounded in this island.\r\n\r\nIn its form, the phrase bears an external, rather than a real\r\nresemblance to ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν. For ποίμην figuratively used expresses\r\nno more than the office of a ruler in his political relation to his\r\nsubjects; while ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν is much more peculiar in character, since\r\nἄναξ exhibits the idea of master as well as ruler, and he is not\r\nmerely ἄναξ of a people, but ἄναξ of individual men, in respect to\r\nsomething appertaining to man as such, of which he is the possessor or\r\nusufructuary. The ποιμὴν λαῶν expresses a relation, which implies that\r\npolitical society is already formed, for λαὸς means a body united in\r\nthat form.\r\n\r\nAgain, we are scarcely entitled to presume that ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν denotes\r\nthe office of ‘any king or chieftain,’ when, though it is used in some\r\nfifty passages, it is only applied to six persons: nor is it less\r\nhazardous to say that it means especially the office of a supreme ruler\r\nor commander, when out of these six persons only one at all answers to\r\nthat description, and when at least three are persons of insignificant\r\npower, as well as individually obscure.\r\n\r\nOnce more, it is the manner of Homer, where he applies an epithet or\r\nphrase characteristically to one of his greater personages, to give\r\nthem the exclusive use of it, such as the ποδωκὴς δῖος for Achilles,\r\nκορυθαίολος for Hector, πολύμητις and πολυτλὰς δῖος for Ulysses. For\r\nexample, κορυθαίολος is used thirty-eight times for Hector, never for\r\nany other hero: though it is used once for Mars, in Il. xx. 38. It\r\nwould be strange if he departed from this usage in the case before\r\nus. But if ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν be a mere phrase of description, as Mure\r\nsupposes, he does depart from it in the strangest manner; for while\r\nhe applies it forty-six times to Agamemnon, he likewise gives it to\r\nthe very insignificant Eumelus. If it be a phrase simply serving the\r\npurpose, as an epithet would, of denoting the great political position\r\nof Agamemnon, how can its force be more utterly shattered than by\r\nbestowing it not only upon Eumelus, who does nothing except drive a\r\nchariot, but upon Euphetes, who is mentioned but once in the poems of\r\nHomer, without any epithet or circumstance whatever except this to\r\ndistinguish him, and who is named nowhere else at all? If it describes\r\na ruler as supreme among rulers, why is it thus debasingly, as well as\r\nloosely, applied? But if it describes a ruler generally, then why is\r\nit employed so restrictedly? The actual mode and conditions of its use\r\nrequire us to examine whether it does not in fact cover some specific\r\nidea, derived from a form of society which, even in the days of Homer,\r\nhad become, or, at the least, was becoming obsolete; perhaps already\r\nin some part a monument of the past, and cutting across, rather than\r\nfitting into, the arrangements and usages of his time.\r\n\r\n_Ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν has a specific meaning._\r\n\r\nThe peculiar formula ‘lord of men’ appears well adapted to mark the\r\nperiod of transition from the patriarchal to the political construction\r\nof society; in the family, sovereignty and the possession of property\r\nare united, and the βασιλεὺς naturally follows after and grows out of\r\nthe ἄναξ. Authority is here clothed in a form more extended than that\r\nof a mere family connection, yet the idea of it remains indeterminate:\r\nthere is no distinct formation of _class_; superiors are not yet viewed\r\nunder the formal political notion of kings, nor (as in λαὸς) have _men_\r\nyet come to conceive of themselves as subjects. There are human beings\r\nwith a superior: but there is no society with a head. In that state of\r\nthings, power, if less secure and rooted, was more absolute: witness\r\nthe projected sacrifice by Abraham of his son Isaac.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, however, what we have said upon the other phrases, it\r\nappears that we have in Homer four words commonly used to express the\r\nruling office, from the highest form of that office downwards: they are,\r\n\r\n1. βασιλεὺς, the most limited: confined in the Iliad to those who\r\nboth were practically supreme, and ruled over considerable territory,\r\nor else were of primary importance from personal prowess or other\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\n2. κρείων, the next; embracing the very highest, but descending to\r\nsecondary princes, though commonly confined to the more considerable.\r\n\r\n3. ποιμὴν λαῶν, which, also capable of application to the highest,\r\nyet, as expressing political dominion in the widest form, embraces the\r\nsubordinate, derivative, and petty principalities even of persons who\r\ndo not appear to have been in any sense independent sovereigns.\r\n\r\n4. More varied in its application than any of these, perhaps older, and\r\nrelated to the time when the only known form of sovereignty implied\r\nindeterminate, and so far absolute powers of disposal, the word ἄναξ\r\ninvolves the double idea of political authority and of ownership; it\r\naccompanies them both, like our word _lord_, when they separate, and it\r\nadheres to each of them in all its forms.\r\n\r\nI admit that the construction which it is now proposed to put upon\r\nἄναξ ἀνδρῶν has not, so far as I am aware, been heretofore propounded;\r\nand that this is, _pro tanto_, a presumption against it. But in lieu\r\nof _pro tanto_, I would in this case crave to write _pro tantillo_;\r\nfor it seems to be the fact, that, as only of late has Ethnology been\r\nsystematically studied, so only of late have the text and diction of\r\nHomer been subjected to minute investigation; and it is reasonable to\r\nexpect, that the further application of critical attention to it may\r\nyet disclose to our view much, which has heretofore been unsuspected.\r\nIt is the more allowable to proceed upon this view in the case of ἄναξ\r\nἀνδρῶν, because so few readers of Homer appear even to have observed\r\nthat it is ever applied to any person besides Agamemnon, and therefore\r\nthe common opinion rests upon an inaccurate impression as to the\r\nelementary facts. My purpose, accordingly, may more justly be described\r\nas an attempt to open a new question, than as an attack upon a critical\r\nverdict regularly delivered.\r\n\r\nLet us now proceed to examine what the facts really are respecting the\r\nuse of the phrase ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν in Homer.\r\n\r\n_Persons to whom it is applied._\r\n\r\nIt is applied to Agamemnon in the following passages:\r\n\r\n  Il. i. 7, 172, 442, 506.\r\n      ii. 402, 434, 441, 612.\r\n      iii. 81, 267, 455.\r\n      iv. 148, 255, 336.\r\n      v. 38.\r\n      vi. 33.\r\n      vii. 162, 314.\r\n      viii. 278.\r\n      ix. 96, 114, 163, 672, 677, 697.\r\n      x. 64, 86, 103, 119, 233.\r\n      xi. 99, 254.\r\n      xiv. 64, 103, 134.\r\n      xviii. 111.\r\n      xix. 51, 76, 146, 172, 184, 199.\r\n      xxiii. 161, 895.\r\n\r\n  Od. viii. 77.\r\n      xi. 396.\r\n\r\nIt is also applied to\r\n\r\n  Anchises, Il. v. 268.\r\n  Æneas, Il. v. 311.\r\n  Augeias, Il. xi. 701, 739.\r\n  Euphetes, Il. xv. 532.\r\n  Eumelus, Il. xxiii. 288.\r\n\r\nNow although, as we have seen, the term is in fact employed only with\r\nnames nearly akin to one another in point of metrical value, yet the\r\nPoet has given us the most distinct evidence that the employment of\r\nit was not a mere metrical expedient to assist him in the use of names\r\notherwise unmanageable. This we learn in the two following forms:\r\n\r\n1. The name Eumelus is one of those to which he applies the phrase:\r\nbut the metrical conjunction of it with this name is by no means\r\nparticularly convenient, for out of five places in which Homer mentions\r\nEumelus in the nominative case, he only once gives him his title of\r\nἄναξ ἀνδρῶν. Again, it is evident that he has no preference for the\r\nend of the verse as a place for the name of Eumelus; for he places it\r\nelsewhere, at the beginning, and in τὴν Εὔμηλος ὄπυιε (Il. ii. 714. Od.\r\niv. 798), on the only two occasions when he uses the nominative without\r\na title annexed. He only puts it at the end of the verse in order to\r\ncouple it with ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, and with κρείων (Il. xxiii. 288, 354). So\r\nfar then from being a metrical convenience, this phrase rather forces\r\nhim out of his way in order to introduce it. So it is with Æneas. Homer\r\nuses his name very many times, but never once places it at the end of a\r\nverse, except in the single case in which he attaches it to the title\r\nἄναξ ἀνδρῶν. Again, then, the phrase compels him to adopt a position\r\nwhich he is uniformly careful to avoid elsewhere for Æneas, and this in\r\nlittle short of forty instances.\r\n\r\n_Persons to whom it might have been applied._\r\n\r\n2. Besides the names to which Homer applies the phrase, he employs\r\na great number of names, of persons having high or the very highest\r\nrank, which possess exactly the same metrical value as one or another\r\nof the six names above quoted; but yet to none of these does he at any\r\ntime give the title of ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν. Of such names I have observed the\r\nfollowing: and I exclude from the list the merely local characters of\r\nthe Odyssey, and all persons in inferior station.\r\n\r\n  (1) Of the same metrical value with Eumelus:\r\n\r\n  Patroclus.\r\n  Pheidippus.\r\n  Euneus.\r\n  Eudorus.\r\n  Euphemus.\r\n  Ægisthus.\r\n  Admetus.\r\n  Amphius.\r\n  Euphorbus.\r\n\r\n  And of the dead,\r\n\r\n  Isandros.\r\n  Adrestus.\r\n\r\n  (2) Of the same metrical value with Augeias, Euphetes, Æneas,\r\n  Anchises:\r\n\r\n  Antenor.\r\n  Sarpedon.\r\n  Pyræchmes.\r\n  Hercules (Heracles).\r\n  Eurystheus.\r\n\r\n  (3) Of the same metrical value with Agamemnon:\r\n\r\n  Diomedes.\r\n  Polypœtes.\r\n  Megapenthes.\r\n  Thrasymedes.\r\n  Eteoneus.\r\n  Agapenor.\r\n  Euphenor.\r\n  Prothoenor.\r\n  Hyperenor.\r\n\r\n  (4) Of the same metrical value with Agamemnon, except having the last\r\n  syllable short:\r\n\r\n  Menelaus.\r\n  Echepolus.\r\n  Melanippus.\r\n  Polydorus.\r\n\r\n  And of the dead,\r\n\r\n  Rhadamanthus.\r\n  Meleagros.\r\n\r\nHere are thirty-five names as susceptible of conjunction with the\r\nphrase ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν as the six to which he attaches it. How comes it to\r\nbe attached, significant as it is _primâ facie_, to the six, and never\r\nto the thirty-five? Did it come and go by accident, or had Homer a\r\nmeaning in it?\r\n\r\nMoreover, I would by no means be understood to admit, that metrical\r\nobstacles would have sufficed to prevent Homer from applying almost any\r\ntitle to almost any name: such were the resources of his genius and his\r\near, and such the freedom that the youthful elasticity of the language\r\nsecured to him.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered too that he has given us an instance (in Il.\r\ni. 7) of a second site, so to speak, for ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν in the Greek\r\nhexameter, which would have enabled him at once to combine it with all\r\nsuch proper names as come within the compass of a dactyl and trochee,\r\nor a spondee and trochee. Such as Πουλυδάμας γὰρ ... Καὶ Πρίαμος μὲν\r\n... Καὶ γὰρ Τευκρὸς ... Θησεὺς αὐτὸς ... Δάρδανος αὐτὸς .... And even\r\nwithout altering its usual position in the verse, by a break of it, or\r\na _cæsura_, which is not unfrequent with him, he might have given us\r\n(for example) ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν γὰρ Ἐρεχθεύς. Or he might by _tmesis_, more\r\nliberally used, have further widened the field for its employment.\r\n\r\nOr again, he would have been free, by the rules of his own usage, to\r\nhave said in the vocative, ἀνδρῶν ἄνα.\r\n\r\n_Homer’s reverence for this title._\r\n\r\nHis abstinence from inflexion absolutely, and from _tmesis_ almost\r\nentirely, in the use of ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, I think deserves remark. We might\r\nbe struck, even in another author, by finding a word fifty-six times\r\nin the nominative singular, and never in any other form: but in Homer\r\nthese slight circumstances have a value and significance, which in\r\nordinary cases it would be more dangerous to assign to them. It seems\r\nto me possible, that this restraint in the use of the name, which\r\nalways assigns to it the most commanding place in the sentence, was\r\nnot unconnected with a sense of reverence towards it. I think that if\r\nwe were to examine the correspondence, for example, between British\r\nMinisters and their Sovereign, we might find that the phrase ‘Your\r\nMajesty’ was placed, under a sort of natural and unconscious bias,\r\nby the writers, in the nominative case, in a proportional number of\r\ninstances far exceeding that which the pronoun ‘you’ would supply in an\r\nordinary letter.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to define this delicate and subtle sentiment: but it\r\nmay perhaps be illustrated by the feeling on which is founded the\r\nprevailing usage of addressing among ourselves the very highest ranks,\r\nand in some languages all persons of consideration, in the third\r\nrather than the second person. And again, it is the same description\r\nof sentiment, which, when carried into the sphere of religion, has led\r\nDante invariably to forbear, when he introduces the name ‘Cristo’ at\r\nthe close of a verse, from placing any other word in rhyme with it, so\r\nthat he makes it its own echo (so to speak), and repeats it thrice, in\r\nno less than four passages, to meet the full demand of his metre[784].\r\n\r\nOr again, as Homer appears to have possessed a fineness of ear which\r\nis not only wonderful, but by us in some part inappreciable, it may be\r\nthat he attached an importance, which we cannot measure, to preserving\r\na perfect uniformity in this dignified and sonorous title, as a means\r\nof producing popular impression, not less than of satisfying his own\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\nOther instances might be given from Homer, bearing upon the case.\r\n\r\nἘνοσίχθων is used forty times, and only once out of the nominative,\r\nthough metrical reasons could not hamper the poet with respect to any\r\nof the cases of this noun. Διογενὴς is used in the nominative and\r\nvocative only. Κύδιστος is used sixteen times, and in the vocative\r\nalone. The feminine form however is found in the nominative, but only\r\nin two passages (one of them with a rival reading) applied to Minerva.\r\nΕὐρυκρείων is found twelve times, and only in the nominative.\r\n\r\nPerhaps again the rarity and slightness of his use of _tmesis_ may be\r\naccounted for, not by euphony alone, but by the circumstance that these\r\ntwo words had grown by titular use almost into one.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the phrase ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν should have disappeared with\r\nHomer himself, while his heroes were incessantly sung by later poets,\r\nof itself raises a presumption that it belonged to a state of things\r\nwhich, when after a wide interval the race of his successors began, had\r\nwholly ceased to exist.\r\n\r\nThat stage of society, in the closing stages of which Homer lived,\r\nand which we know through him alone of classical authors, was the\r\npatriarchal stage in its last phasis. By the patriarchal stage of\r\nsociety, I mean the stage in which rights on the one hand, and powers\r\nand duties on the other, were still indeterminate, and were gradually\r\npassing from the state of _nebula_ into that of body. Now, if the\r\nphrase ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν belonged to it, without doubt it must at the outset\r\nhave exhibited its unvarying characteristic, the union of sovereign\r\npolitical power not only with hereditary descent, but with a reference\r\nto some original stock as an object of deep veneration, if not to a\r\nrelationship of blood more or less remote between the royal family and\r\ntheir subjects, or to the dominant race among them.\r\n\r\n_Its relation to Patriarchal Chieftaincy._\r\n\r\nThe chieftaincies of the Celtic tribes in our own island, such as\r\nthey existed until within only one century back, afford us a partial\r\nanalogy. The primary idea is that of the headship of an extended\r\nfamily, sometimes approximating to the character of a nation;\r\nsometimes more limited, so that many of such families or tribes may be\r\nregarded as belonging to the same nation. One marked characteristic\r\nof these chieftaincies is that the preeminence and power, which\r\nthey attached to birth, is separable from, though capable of union\r\nwith, sovereignty strictly so called, that is, an absolute political\r\nsupremacy, and subsists in its main particulars even after the\r\ndivision; neither does it become ambiguous or indefinite, where the\r\nfield for its exercise is a narrow one. The splendour of the name\r\nincreases with the range of dominion, but its integrity subsists even\r\nin the most contracted sphere, so long as the organization on which it\r\nis dependent remains.\r\n\r\nIt is at least conceivable, that the Greek and the Celtic chieftaincies\r\nthus far agree. They differ in this, that the Hellenes, whenever we\r\nhear of them, appear more or less clearly as the subjugators of some\r\nrace in prior occupancy of the soil, and as the masters of slaves: so\r\nthat, while the relation of the Highland Chief to his clan was elevated\r\nand softened by union in blood, a Greek chieftaincy rather affected the\r\nrelation between the head of the tribe and, not the whole, but only a\r\nprivileged part, of the community.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental idea of this chieftainship would lie in the\r\npossession of the powers of government, patriarchally organized, by\r\nlineal descent, and traced up to the point which was the recognised\r\nfountain-head of the traditions of the race.\r\n\r\nWhere the idea of succession by primogeniture was well defined, there\r\nprobably would be but one line in existence at a time that could hold\r\nthe title for any one race. But there might be cases where the rule of\r\nprimogeniture was unknown, or not consistently applied, or where the\r\nfact of elder descent was contested, or where common descent from some\r\none acknowledged race and period might confer the title on a variety of\r\nfamilies, situated at remote points from one another, in each of which\r\nit might afterwards be confined to the lineal heir. In such cases there\r\nwould be a plurality of lines, all running up into the stem of a common\r\nancestor, and all bearing in their own separate successions the title\r\nof chieftainships.\r\n\r\nAgain, among these chieftains one might be politically supreme over the\r\nrest within a given country. Such were the Macdonalds, Lords of the\r\nIsles, in Scotland, who claimed to be kings as well as chieftains: and\r\nsuch in Ireland were the Kevanaghs, O’Ruarcs, and O’Briens.\r\n\r\nIf therefore I am right in interpreting the phrase ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν to\r\nmean properly (together with something more) _Chieftain_, in a sense\r\nincluding the main elements of Celtic chieftaincy, or _Patriarch_, (but\r\nthe latter phrase is less applicable from its conventional connection\r\nwith advanced age), then it need excite no surprise if we find an ἄναξ\r\nἀνδρῶν on each side, and not in the supreme command. At the same time,\r\nthough there are vast differences in power between one Homeric ἄναξ\r\nἀνδρῶν and another, they are all, so far as we see, strictly in the\r\nposition of princes ordinarily independent within their dominions,\r\nthough owning, it might be, the prerogatives of a qualified political\r\nsupremacy lodged in other hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Case of Agamemnon._\r\n\r\n_Mode of its use for Agamemnon._\r\n\r\nIt is very worthy of remark, that Homer scarcely ever describes\r\nAgamemnon by personal epithets. In a few passages (I see seven noticed)\r\nhe uses the word δῖος in connection with the name: but this is one of\r\nthe least specific among the Homeric epithets for individuals, and is\r\nemployed not only for Achilles, Hector, Ulysses, Nestor, and others,\r\nbut for a crowd of inferior personages, so that, as a word of the most\r\ngeneral purport, it has little or no defining or individualizing power.\r\nIt means preeminence in some particular kind, among a class, and it\r\nis applicable to any class; to Agamemnon greatest among sovereigns,\r\nand to Eumæus worthiest among swineherds. A few times Homer calls\r\nhim ἥρως, a word which he also applies to the entire Greek army (Il.\r\nii. 110). In all other places, (I omit, of course, the invectives of\r\nAchilles,) he is characterised only by words taken from his position or\r\ndescent. The principal of these are Ἀτρείδης, which he enjoys in common\r\nwith Menelaus: κρείων, applied to him and to various other chiefs:\r\nποιμὴν λαῶν, yet more largely and loosely used: εὐρυκρείων, which is\r\nexclusively his own among men, and which is the epithet used by Homer\r\nas properly descriptive of his wide-reaching sway. It is also applied\r\nto Neptune among the immortals, because vastness was with Homer a\r\nprincipal feature of the θάλασσα, his domain. Lastly, Agamemnon is ἄναξ\r\nἀνδρῶν, which, as I hold, describes his position by birth as the head\r\nor chieftain of the Achæans properly so called.\r\n\r\nThere are two remarkable passages, which are evidently intended to\r\nsupply the key-note, as it were, for our conception of the material\r\npower of Agamemnon: the first, Il. ii. 108, respecting the sceptre:\r\nthe second, in the Catalogue, Il. ii. 576-80: in both of these he is\r\ncalled κρείων, in neither ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν. This fact entirely accords with\r\nthe supposition that neither a determinate form of political power, nor\r\nmilitary command, is the vital idea of the phrase.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, although the Poet does not seem to connect this\r\nphrase with imperial power, yet that he intended to use it as one\r\nhighly characteristic, we may at once deem probable from his having\r\nemployed it in that remarkable passage[785] with which the poem begins,\r\nand which so succinctly, yet so broadly opens the subject of it.\r\nFor here he has taken the phrase ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν out of its usual, and\r\nelsewhere its only place in the verse, and has subjoined it, contrary\r\nin this likewise to his uniform practice elsewhere, to the name of the\r\nperson described by it. The line is\r\n\r\n    Ἀτρείδης τε, ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, καὶ δῖος Ἀχιλλεύς.\r\n\r\nEvidently this is done for greater emphasis: as ‘great Alexander’\r\nis less emphatic than ‘Alexander the Great,’ and ‘king Darius’ than\r\n‘Darius the king.’ It may be admitted that the epithet δῖος, used in\r\nthis place for Achilles, is not one of the most characteristic: but\r\nAchilles had already been described (in v. i.) by that distinguished\r\npatronymic which formed his chief glory[786], as it connected him,\r\nthrough his father and his grandfather, with Jupiter.\r\n\r\nAll these presumptions drawn from the case of Agamemnon converge upon\r\na point: they tend to show, that ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν means preeminence indeed,\r\nbut yet a particular kind of preeminence; and one distinct from, and\r\nmore specific than, the general idea of sovereignty.\r\n\r\n_Extraction and station of Agamemnon._\r\n\r\nThe so-called genealogy of Agamemnon differs from every other one given\r\nby Homer in this, that it does not describe the descent in a right\r\nline. For as Thyestes, one of his three predecessors on the Pelopid\r\nthrone was the father of Ægisthus, who was the contemporary, but yet\r\nnot the brother of Agamemnon, he must without doubt have been brother\r\nto Atreus, Agamemnon’s father. It is in fact not a genealogy simply,\r\nbut rather a succession in dignities. The dignity of ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν may\r\nhave combined with that of the political supremacy to lead Homer into\r\nthis unusual course. If, as I suppose, ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν required the double\r\nderivation both of lineage and of sovereignty, this was the way, and\r\nthe only way, in which Homer could attain his end. And his having\r\npursued this method seems to imply that such _was_ his end.\r\n\r\nI cannot therefore under the conditions of the definition given above,\r\nexplain the application of the phrase to Agamemnon by mere reference\r\nto his political supremacy. It will be necessary to prove, either by\r\ndirect or by presumptive evidence, his lineal connection with the\r\nprimitive Grecian or Hellenic stock, the trunk of the tree from which\r\nother Achæan families were branches and offshoots only.\r\n\r\nI propose to do this by showing,\r\n\r\nFirst, that no appreciable value is to be attached to the notions which\r\nrepresent him as the grandson of an Asiatic immigrant; while even if\r\nthis descent could be made good, we should not on that account be\r\njustified in at once proceeding to deny that the Pelopids were of pure\r\nHellenic blood.\r\n\r\nSecondly, that he was not merely at the moment the political head of\r\nGreece, but that he was also the hereditary chief of the Achæans, then\r\nthe ruling tribe of the country.\r\n\r\nThirdly, that this Achæan tribe was in all likelihood derived from\r\nThessaly, where it was especially rooted and distinguished: as Thessaly\r\nwas itself fed from the Helli of the mountains, and constituted\r\nthe secondary and immediate source from whence the Hellenic races\r\nsuccessively issued, and spread themselves over the peninsula.\r\n\r\nI do not pretend to carry the proof of a patriarchal position or lineal\r\nchieftaincy in the case of Agamemnon further. We do not know what was\r\nthe strictly original royal stock of the Hellenic tribes. The current\r\ntradition of Hellen and his sons would be very convenient, but it is\r\ntoo obviously accommodated to after-times, and too flatly at variance\r\nwith the earliest, that is to say with the Homeric accounts, to be in\r\nthe slightest degree trustworthy as an historic basis. We may take\r\nthe Hesiodic tradition as affording evidence of the belief that there\r\nwas a primitive royal stock, and that the ruling families had been\r\nderived from it, since within these limits it does not contradict\r\nHomer; but we can justly build upon it nothing further. Undoubtedly\r\nthe very employment of the phrase ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, if the proposed\r\nconstruction of it can be made good, will greatly fortify this belief.\r\nBut this can only be made good in a presumptive manner: as by showing\r\nthat the phrase was only given in ruling families: and only in the\r\nrepresentative lines of ruling families: and only in families which\r\nruled over tribes of the dominant race; and which had so ruled from\r\ntime immemorial--that is to say, they must be families of which it\r\ncannot be shown that at any time they had acquired their position in\r\ntheir own tribe. If a first ancestor, apparently the channel of the\r\ntitle, is indicated, he must be one from whom history begins: there\r\nmust be nothing before him, nothing to show that he or his line had\r\never been less than what he came to be. Lastly, the tribes, over which\r\nthe ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν rules, must be in visible or presumable connection\r\nlocally with the original seat or cradle of the nation; and it will\r\nbe a further confirmation of the argument if, as we ascend the\r\nlineal lines, we find in them a tendency to converge towards an unity\r\nof origin, which we shall find poetically expressed as the divine\r\nparentage of Jupiter, and thus covered with the golden clouds of a\r\nremote antiquity, that not even the sun can pierce[787]. Perhaps we may\r\neven find reason to suppose it likely that descent from Jupiter was an\r\nessential qualification for the title of ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν.\r\n\r\n_Arguments against his Hellenic descent._\r\n\r\nFirst, then, let us deal with the negative or adverse presumptions,\r\nwhich would go to prove that Agamemnon was not Hellenic at all.\r\n\r\nIt may be urged,\r\n\r\n1. That we see, even from Homer, that Pelops was a recent hero, only\r\ntwo generations before the _Troica_, so that Agamemnon has no antiquity\r\nto boast of.\r\n\r\n2. That, according to extraneous tradition, there is no connection\r\nbetween Agamemnon and the Hellic stock: as Pelops is reputed to be the\r\nson of Tantalus, and Tantalus the king of Phrygia.\r\n\r\nTo the first I answer, that the list of names in Il. ii. 101-8, is not\r\nsimply a genealogy, for it includes Thyestes, who is not in the right\r\nline; but it is a succession of kings on a common throne, and can only\r\ntherefore begin with Pelops, as the first who sat upon that throne.\r\n\r\nBut, further, even if it were a genealogy, yet Homer seems usually to\r\nbegin his genealogies not with the first known ancestor of a person,\r\nbut with the first ancestor of his who settled in the place where he\r\nexercises power. Thus Nestor, though we acquire indirectly a knowledge\r\nof his earlier descent through the Νεκυΐα, has no genealogy beyond\r\nNeleus his father, because he was the ancestor that migrated into\r\nPeloponnesus, or, at least, that first acquired the Pylian throne, by\r\nmarriage into a prior, and perhaps a Pelasgian house[788]. Ulysses\r\nhas none beyond Arceisius; and it is plain, from the records of the\r\nearlier dynasty in Ithaca, that there could have been no king of that\r\nhouse before him. Dardanus and Minos, heads of genealogies, were also\r\nthe founders of sovereignties. Again, Portheus is given us as the head\r\nof the Œneid line in Ætolia: and we have found it probable that he was\r\nthe first of his race[789] who migrated into that country. The same\r\nconsiderations, in all likelihood, hold good with regard to Pelops.\r\n\r\nNow with respect to the second objection.\r\n\r\nWe are to remember that Homer has nowhere asserted the connection\r\nbetween Pelops and Tantalus, or between Tantalus and Phrygia.\r\n\r\nBut not even the latter connection, and far less the former, would\r\ndisprove the title of Agamemnon to represent lineally the character of\r\nἄναξ ἀνδρῶν. For, as we have seen, that title subsisted in the line of\r\nDardanus, and the causes which planted it there might also have planted\r\nit in Phrygia; which is not irrationally supposed to have been the line\r\nof march for the Hellic race in its original movement westwards[790].\r\nMoreover, Phrygia is not a name confined to Asia.\r\n\r\n_Connection of Tantalus with the Greeks._\r\n\r\nThere are, however, many indirect Homeric indications, as well as\r\nmuch extra-Homeric tradition, which tend to connect Pelops both with\r\nTantalus and with Greece.\r\n\r\nFirst, even if Tantalus were known to Homer as the father of Pelops, he\r\ncould not have been named in the tradition of Il. ii. 101-8, unless he\r\nhad occupied, like Pelops, the throne to which Agamemnon succeeded.\r\n\r\nFrom the appearance of Tantalus in the Νεκυΐα, it is probable that\r\nHomer regarded him as Greek, either by birth or by what we may call\r\nnaturalization. This he might be in the Poet’s view, if the traditions\r\nconcerning him, without assigning to him Greek birth or even residence,\r\nmade him the father of one who became a great Greek sovereign. If,\r\nfor instance, we take the name of Æolus; it is the source of some of\r\nthe most famous Greek houses, yet Homer never mentions it, except in\r\nthe patronymic, and gives us no means of absolutely attaching it to\r\nany part of Greece. Æolus may have been known only as the father of\r\nGreeks. So Minos was not of Greek birth; but was naturalized, and\r\ntherefore appears in the Νεκυΐα as the judge of the nether world. All\r\nthe other personages, without exception, who are introduced there, are\r\napparently Greek: Sisyphus, Hercules, Tityus, Theseus, Pirithous, from\r\nclear marks of residence: even Orion, since he is made the hero of a\r\nscene in Delos[791], appears, whatever his origin, to have been already\r\nHellenized by tradition. Nor is it easy to avoid the same assumption\r\nwith respect to Tantalus.\r\n\r\nAgain, we may be quite sure, that Tantalus was a person of the highest\r\nrank and position. None others seem to have been distinguished by an\r\nexpress notice of their fate after death. Orion was the object of the\r\npassion of Aurora (Od. v. 121). Tityus was an offender so lofty, that\r\nhe became the occasion of a voyage of Rhadamanthus himself to deal with\r\nhis crime[792]. Sisyphus was, as we have found reason to believe[793],\r\nof the most exalted stock.\r\n\r\nThe punishment of Tantalus in the nether world is probably, as in\r\nother cases, the reflection of a previous catastrophe, certainly of\r\na previous character, upon earth. The nature of his punishment is a\r\nperpetual temptation, of irresistible force, presented to the appetites\r\nof hunger and thirst, while the gratification of it is wholly and\r\nperpetually denied. This shews that his offence on earth must have been\r\nsome form of πλεονεξία, of greediness, presumption, or ambition. It is\r\ntherefore not unlikely that by restless attempts at acquisition, he may\r\nhave convulsed his dominions, and caused his son to migrate.\r\n\r\nNow this supposed vein of character in Tantalus would thoroughly accord\r\nwith that of the Pelopid line. He is punished for covetousness or\r\nacquisitiveness. His son gains a kingdom through Mercury, who is the\r\ngod of increase by fair means or foul. His grandson Thyestes gathers\r\nwealth (πολύαρς, Il. ii. 106): his great-grandson Agamemnon is deeply\r\nmarked by the avarice everywhere glanced at in the Iliad: and finally\r\nwe have the reckless and guilty cravings of the ambition of Ægisthus.\r\n\r\nWe are by no means without reasons from the poems for placing Tantalus,\r\nas the later tradition places him, among the heroes of the stock\r\nof Jupiter. One ground is afforded us by the text of the Eleventh\r\nOdyssey for supposing that he was, I do not say a son, but at least a\r\ndescendant of Jupiter. It is this; that apparently all the heroes, to\r\nwhom we are thus introduced, were at least of divine extraction. They\r\nare, besides Tantalus, as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. Minos, who was a son of Jupiter. (Od. xi. 568.)\r\n\r\n2. Orion: he was of divine extraction according to the later tradition.\r\nIn Homer he has no parentage, but he had at least attained to divine\r\nhonours, inasmuch as he was translated into a star. (Od. v. 274 et\r\nalibi.)\r\n\r\n3. Tityus, son of Γαῖα. (Od. xi. 596, and vii. 324.)\r\n\r\n4. Sisyphus, son of Æolus; therefore descended from Jupiter.\r\n\r\n5. Hercules, son of Jupiter (ibid. 620.)\r\n\r\nBut I rely specially upon the passages towards the end, where these\r\nare all called ἄνδρες ἥρωες, and where Ulysses says he might have seen\r\nothers, namely, Θήσεα Πειρίθοόν τε, θεῶν ἐρικύδεα τέκνα, illustrious\r\nchildren of the gods: as if to be a child of the gods were a condition\r\nof appearing in this august, though mournful, company.\r\n\r\nHereas, a Megarian author of uncertain age, is quoted by Plutarch[794]\r\nas having declared that the last cited verse was among the\r\ninterpolations of Pisistratus. But Hereas was as likely to be wrong\r\nin this statement, through Megarian antipathy, as Pisistratus to have\r\ninterpolated the verse in favour of Athenian vanity. The internal\r\nevidence is, I think, in its favour. For the phrase θεῶν ἐρικύδεα τέκνα\r\nis, according to the view here given, really characteristic. It is,\r\nat the same time, characteristic through the medium of an idea which,\r\nthough it can be deduced fairly from the text, is not obvious upon\r\nits surface; namely the idea that all the heroes of the Νεκυΐα were\r\ndivine. The verse is therefore supported by something in the nature of\r\na spontaneous or undesigned coincidence.\r\n\r\nThe post-Homeric tradition makes Niobe the daughter of Tantalus;\r\nand, if this be so, then we may derive from her very high position a\r\nfurther support to the presumption that Tantalus was of the race of\r\nJupiter, as also to the hypothesis of his personal connection with\r\nGreece. For that the tradition of Niobe is Greek we see, from its being\r\ncited by Achilles; and that she was a sovereign is clearly implied\r\nby the combined effect of various circumstances. The first is her\r\nbeing compared by Achilles with Priam. The second, that the vaunt\r\nof an inferior person would hardly have been noticed by the direct\r\nintervention of the gods. The third is the singular extent and dignity\r\nof that intervention: Apollo slays the sons, Diana the daughters;\r\nJupiter converts the people to stone; the Immortals at large bury the\r\ndead. The fourth is the use of the term λαοὺς, which means plainly the\r\nsubjects of the kingdom where Niobe was queen.\r\n\r\nWe cannot now carry farther the presumptions that Tantalus was\r\nthe descendant of Jupiter, and Agamemnon of Tantalus: but if, in\r\nconsidering the cases of the other members of his class, we shall\r\nsufficiently shew that they were all descended in common repute from\r\nJupiter, we shall then perhaps be warranted in relying more decidedly\r\nupon the connection, which is suggested by the text in the case of\r\nAgamemnon through his presumed ancestor Tantalus.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to find more than slight traces of the seat of the\r\npower of Tantalus from Homer.\r\n\r\nHe mentions a mountain called Sipylus[795], near the Achelous, and\r\nthus near the principal passage from Northern and Middle into Southern\r\nGreece. Here it is that he places the mourning Niobe. But Pausanias\r\nplaces the tomb of Pelops on the summit of Mount Sipylus, meaning,\r\napparently, the hill of that name in Lydia[796]. Again, the Phryges,\r\nover whom the later tradition reports him to have reigned, are also\r\nmade known to us as a Thracian people[797]: a designation quite capable\r\nof embracing any of the hill tribes in the neighbourhood of Thessaly.\r\nWe have another sign of the extension of this name in the Phrygians of\r\nAttica, mentioned by Thucydides (ii. 22): and the Phrygian alphabet is\r\nclosely akin to that of Greece.\r\n\r\nStrabo, however, observes, that the state of these traditions is\r\nso greatly confused, so as to make them scarcely tractable for the\r\npurposes of history[798].\r\n\r\n_Place of Pelops in Greek history._\r\n\r\nThe connection of Pelops with Southern Greece is well supported by\r\nthe ancient name of Peloponnesus. No notice of this name is found in\r\nHomer; but we need not be surprised, if Pelops was the first of his\r\nrace in that part of the country, at finding him sparely recognised by\r\nthe Poet: it is the uniform manner of the poet with strangers or _novi\r\nhomines_.\r\n\r\nThe Homeric notices of Pelops are not more liberal than of Tantalus. 1.\r\nWe find him called πλήξιππος[799] in such a way as shows that something\r\nconnected with the driving of a chariot must have been attached either\r\nto the known habits, or to some great crisis of his life, or to both.\r\nIn either mode, it agrees with the common tradition, according to\r\nwhich, by success in the chariot race, he won the hand of Hippodameia,\r\ndaughter of king Œnomaus, and therewith the throne of Pisa. We have\r\nanother fact from Homer which tends to support this tradition, namely,\r\nthat in the earliest youth of Nestor there were, as we have seen,\r\npublic games, which included chariot-races, in Elis.\r\n\r\n2. The common tradition is also further supported by the passage in the\r\nSecond Iliad, which gives us the line of Pelopid sovereigns. For we are\r\nthere told that Vulcan wrought the Pelopid sceptre for Jupiter: that\r\nJupiter gave it to Mercury, and Mercury to Pelops the horse-driver, who\r\nhanded it on to Atreus and the rest. From this statement two things\r\nclearly appear. First, that the throne of Pelops was gained either by\r\ncraft, or at least by enterprise, of his own. Secondly, that it was a\r\nnew power which he erected, and that he was not merely the transferee\r\nof the power of the Perseid line.\r\n\r\nNor is it difficult to discern wherein the novelty consisted. This\r\nsceptre carried the right of paramount lordship over all Greece--\r\n\r\n    πολλῇσιν νήσοισι καὶ Ἄργεϊ παντὶ ἀνάσσειν[800]--\r\n\r\nwhereas the Perseids had been local sovereigns, though probably the\r\nfirst in rank and power among their contemporaries of Continental\r\nGreece.\r\n\r\nNow this sovereignty, thus extended, was plainly an Achæan sovereignty.\r\nFor we have seen that, contemporaneously with its erection, Homer drops\r\nthe marked and exclusive use of the word Ἀργεῖοι for the inhabitants\r\nof that quarter, and calls them by preference Ἀχαιοὶ, the older name\r\nfalling into the shade. Thus, then, the Achæans rose with the house of\r\nPelops: and this being the case, we can the better understand why it\r\nwas that that house rose to so great an elevation. It was because the\r\nAchæan race had now acquired extension in the North and in the South\r\nof Greece, in Eastern and Western Peloponnesus, and because it usually\r\npredominated wheresoever it went. Thus the house of Pelops had an\r\nopportunity of gaining influence and power, which had not been enjoyed\r\nby the preceding dynasties, though they ruled from the same sovereign\r\nseat. They were families only: the Pelopids were chiefs of a race.\r\n\r\nWhat we have thus seen from Homer, with respect to the high position\r\nattained by Pelops, is confirmed by the later tradition.\r\n\r\nPausanias notices the local traces of Tantalus, as well as of Pelops,\r\nin Elis. A harbour there bore the name of Tantalus[801]: and Pelops was\r\nworshipped in a sanctuary hard by the temple of Jupiter Olympius. It\r\nwas on the right hand, in front of that temple, a very marked situation\r\nin all likelihood: and Pausanias says, that the Elians reverenced\r\nPelops among heroes, like Jupiter among gods. It was probably on this\r\naccount, and as a memorial of the worship from high places, that the\r\nθρόνος, or seat of Pelops, was, as he says, not only in Sipylus, but on\r\nthe summit of the mountain.\r\n\r\nAnother tradition makes Pelops the original king of Pisa, the rival\r\ntown to Elis, which at length succumbed to it. And a further tradition\r\nreports, that he became the son-in-law of Œnomaus, king of Pisa, by\r\nconquering him in the chariot-race: and together with this, that he\r\nrestored the Olympian Games. Another tradition reports him to have come\r\nfrom Olenos in Achaia: and as the Dorians, with the Heraclids, came\r\ninto Peloponnesus by that route, probably as the easiest, so, and for\r\nthe same reason, may Pelops probably have done. Lastly, while Homer\r\nplaces Achæans in Ægina and in Mases, (of which the site is unknown,)\r\nPausanias (b. ii. c. 34) states that nine islands (νησίδες) off the\r\ncoast of Methana, which lies directly opposite Ægina, were in his time\r\ncalled the Islands of Pelops.\r\n\r\nBefore quitting the subject of Pelops, I would observe, that his\r\nworship in Olympia with such peculiar honours is connected with a\r\ntradition, that he raised the Olympian Games to a distinction which\r\nthey had never before attained. Now if we view him as the principal\r\nchief who brought the Achæans into Peloponnesus, this tradition tends\r\nto support the view which has been taken in a former section of the\r\nrelation between the Hellic race and the institution of public Games.\r\nNor is there any thing more intrinsically probable, than that a chief\r\nfrom the great breeding region of Thessaly should have either founded\r\nthe chariot or horse-races of Olympia, or should have raised them to\r\nan unprecedented celebrity, and secured for them the truly national\r\nposition that they for so long a time maintained.\r\n\r\nWe have seen thus far,\r\n\r\n1. That the title of ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν is employed by Homer as the chief\r\ndistinction of Agamemnon.\r\n\r\n2. That most probably Agamemnon was descended from Tantalus, as well\r\nas from Pelops, that the line was a line of sovereigns all along, and\r\nTantalus in all likelihood a reputed descendant of Jupiter himself.\r\n\r\n3. That the Achæans emerge in company with the Pelopids, from the\r\ncavern of pre-historic night, and that the Pelopids are therefore to\r\nbe taken as in all likelihood the chief and senior house of the Achæan\r\ntribe.\r\n\r\nBut we have still to ask, whence came the Achæans themselves? and how\r\nare we to prove their connection with the Hellenic name and stock?\r\n\r\nAnd first, as to Homeric evidence.\r\n\r\n_Achæans from Thessaly._\r\n\r\nWe have already seen, in considering Homer’s account of the contingent\r\nof Achilles, and also from Il. ix. 395, that the Achæan race appears\r\nto have been the dominant one in the proper and original Hellas of\r\nThessaly: which appears to place it beyond doubt, that the Achæans were\r\nthey who first carried with them extensively into Greece the Hellenic\r\nname, a name always following in the wake of the Achæan one, and in\r\nHomer extending to all Greece, unless we except that part which was the\r\nsovereign seat of Achæan power.\r\n\r\nThe first form of the name is with the Helli of Northern Thessaly:\r\nthe second is developed into the Hellas proper of Southern Thessaly;\r\nwe find the third in the more large and less determinate use of the\r\nword for Greece to the northward of the Isthmus. The name gains this\r\nextension apparently just during the period while the Achæans are\r\nmoving southward, as the house of Ulysses to Ithaca, the house of\r\nNeleus, perhaps with an Achæan train, to Pylos, the Pelopids to Mycenæ\r\nand Sparta, Tydeus from Ætolia to Argos.\r\n\r\nAnd again, we must observe this distinction. We see the Achæans come\r\ninto the Peloponnesus, and we can, from the text of Homer, point out\r\nthe time when they were not there. But we do not see them come into\r\nThessaly from among the Helli of the mountains. We simply find their\r\nname prominent there; from which we must conclude, that Homer meant to\r\npoint them out as the first representatives on an adequate scale of\r\nHellas in that country.\r\n\r\nAll this is strongly confirmed by the later tradition as to the\r\nconnection of Pelops with the Achæans of Thessaly, and by the clear\r\nhistorical proofs in our possession of the profound root which the\r\nAchæan name had taken there.\r\n\r\nStrabo, in a passage where he chooses a particular tradition from among\r\nmany, as peculiarly worthy of record, says[802],\r\n\r\nἈχαιοὺς γὰρ τοὺς Φθιώτας φασὶ συγκατελθόντας Πέλοπι εἰς τὴν\r\nΠελοπόννησον, οἰκῆσαι τὴν Λακωνικὴν· τοσοῦτον δ’ ἀρετῇ διενεγκεῖν, ὥστε\r\nτὴν Πελοπόννησον, ἐκ πολλῶν ἤδη χρόνων Ἄργος λεγομένην, τότε Ἀχαϊκὸν\r\nἌργος λεχθῆναι.\r\n\r\nThus he at once asserts the connection of Pelops with the Achæans, and\r\nof the Achæans with Thessaly. He proceeds to say, that Laconia was\r\nconsidered to have a peculiar title to the name of Achaic Argos[803];\r\nthat some construed Od. iii. 251 as supporting it, and that the\r\nAchæans, driven by the Dorians out of Laconia, in their turn displaced\r\nan Ionian race from Achaia, and took possession of the district.\r\n\r\nHerodotus[804], in treating of the Peloponnesus, describes the\r\nArcadians and Cynurians as αὐτόχθονες, who had never changed their\r\nhabitation; four other races, including the Dorians, as ἐπήλυδες, and\r\nthe Achæans as having migrated about the Peloponnesus, but never left\r\nit. He does not explicitly place the Achæans in either class; and this\r\ntradition does not throw much light on the origin of the Achæans, which\r\nwould seem not to have been within his knowledge, but only deals with\r\nmatter subsequent to their entry into Peloponnesus.\r\n\r\nPausanias[805], again, would seem rather to draw the Thessalian Achæans\r\nfrom Peloponnesus than _vice versa_. He tells us that, after the death\r\nof Xuthus, Achæus went with an army from Ægialus, and established\r\nhimself in Thessaly. But with Homer before us, we may boldly say,\r\nthat there was no such person as either the Xuthus or the Achæus of\r\nthe later tradition, and that there were, on the other hand, Achæans\r\nin Thessaly long before the time assigned to this Achæus, namely, the\r\nepoch when the race took refuge in Ægialus. This tradition, then, is\r\nlate and worthless, and, even if it directly contradicted that of\r\nStrabo, which it does not, could not be put in competition with it.\r\n\r\nThe tradition which made Phthiotis in Southern Thessaly the cradle of\r\nthe Achæan race, where it first grew into conscious life, seems to have\r\nbeen an undying one.\r\n\r\n_Duration of the name in Thessaly._\r\n\r\nHere again history comes in to our aid. Throughout the historic\r\ntimes of Greece, and down to the era of Polybius, there were Achæans\r\nof Phthiotis. When, 205 years before Christ, Quintius, the Roman\r\ngeneral, examined into the origin of the Greek cities, and made a\r\nclassification of them[806], the Achæans of Phthiotis were declared to\r\nbe Thessalians: and he appears to use the name for all Phthians, since\r\nhe calls Phaxidas[807] an Achæan, seemingly for no other reason than\r\nthat he was an inhabitant of Melitea, a city of Phthiotis.\r\n\r\nI take it then to be sufficiently proved, that Agamemnon and his\r\nhouse were the proper heads of the Achæan race, which rose with them.\r\nThe proof is doubled by the fact that they fell with it: for in the\r\npost-Homeric literature, all of which follows the Dorian conquest, the\r\nAchæan name has ceased to be a living name for the nation of the Greeks.\r\n\r\nAnd as the Pelopids were the leaders of the Achæans, so I now assume it\r\nto be sufficiently shown from Homer, that the Achæans were in his time\r\nat the head of all the Hellenic families and tribes; of the Dorians,\r\nthe Æolids, the Cephallenes, and whatever others came from the same\r\nstock, and were in fact, for their age, the proper type of Hellenism\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThat most remarkable supremacy of Agamemnon over the Greek nation,\r\nwhich is so strongly marked on the page of Homer, and to the force of\r\nwhich Thucydides ascribes the wonderful movement of the Trojan war,\r\nleft behind it a tradition which it was thought worth while by the\r\nruling race of Dorians to appropriate, even after the shipwreck of the\r\nold political system.\r\n\r\nOrestes came to the throne of Agamemnon, and Tisamenus to that of\r\nOrestes. He was cast out by the Heraclids with the Dorians, and they\r\nmade Sparta the chief seat of their power. Thus established in the\r\nprimacy of Greece, they held it, under the name of Ἡγεμονία, contested\r\nsometimes, but only after the lapse of several ages, by Athens:\r\nnever absolutely taken away, until it passed, as Polybius says,\r\nunexpectedly, into the hands of the Thebans, in the fourth century\r\nbefore the Christian era.\r\n\r\nTisamenus and his Achæans went into Ægialus, and gave it their own\r\nname. But the imperial Spartans found it for their interest to put\r\nin their claim to the old Agamemnonian title. So, as Pausanias[808]\r\ninforms us, even down to his day, the Tomb of Tisamenus was shown in\r\nSparta, and hard by it the Lycurgian feast of Pheiditia was kept; with\r\na tradition that their fathers, admonished by an oracle, had fetched\r\nthe remains of the last Pelopid sovereign from Helice in Achæa. On\r\nthe other hand, the Achæans, who in the time of Polybius[809] had not\r\nyet ceased to keep the image of their legendary ancestor Achæus, and\r\nwhose claim to that image was recognised by the Roman general, likewise\r\ncherished a tradition that the family of Tisamenus had been continued,\r\nand had reigned among them down to the time of Ogygus[810], when their\r\nLeague was formed upon the basis of democratic institutions.\r\n\r\n_Dorians appropriate the Pelopid succession._\r\n\r\nNow it is no more than we might expect, that the Achæans should, in\r\ntheir depressed fortunes, fondly cherish the recollections of their\r\nglory, by preserving and honouring the memory of the last of that race,\r\nwho, through being their sovereigns, were also the heads of the Greek\r\nnation. But why did the Dorians exhibit an anxiety of a kind in their\r\nposition so remarkable? Such a feeling could hardly have existed, had\r\nthere not been a special character attaching to the Pelopid race, as\r\npossessed not only of an actual supremacy, but of some peculiar title\r\nby descent, to which it was worth the while of the Dorian sovereigns to\r\nlay claim, as a kind of heirs by adoption. We do not find that when the\r\nPelopids came in with their Achæans, they had shown any corresponding\r\nsolicitude to connect themselves with the memory of Danaids or of\r\nPerseids: on the contrary, Homer expressly disconnects the dynasties,\r\nby assigning to the Pelopids a new sceptre, fresh by the hands of\r\nMercury from Jupiter. It seems to follow, that in all likelihood the\r\nPelopids had something which neither Danaids nor Perseids possessed\r\nbefore them, and which the Dorians too did not hold at all, or did not\r\nhold by so clear a title: the honour, namely, not of Hellenic blood\r\nalone, but of being ruled by a family which represented an original and\r\nprimitive sovereignty over the Hellenic nation, through its foremost,\r\nor Achæan tribe.\r\n\r\nThis is the more remarkable, because the Dorian sovereigns of Sparta\r\nclaimed Hercules, and through him Jupiter, for their progenitor. But\r\nthe patriarchal chieftaincy, though not more directly connected with a\r\ndivine stock, had superadded to it that accumulation of dignity, which\r\ndepends upon the unbroken transmission of power from the most remote\r\nhistoric origin: and Hercules was modern in comparison with those to\r\nwhom some of the Hellenic families were able (as we have seen) to trace\r\ntheir ancestry.\r\n\r\nWere we to give credit to the common tradition respecting Hellen and\r\nhis sons, I admit that it would raise a new difficulty in the way\r\nof the construction, which I propose to attach to the ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν.\r\nInstead of seeing Agamemnon invested with it because he is head of the\r\nAchæans, and highly favoured by a special, nay by an almost exclusive\r\nappropriation of it, because they are the foremost Hellenic tribe,\r\nwe should have to own in them the youngest of all the branches from\r\nthat stem, with Dorians, Æolians, and Ionians too, taking precedence\r\nof them: and we should have to look, and look in vain, for any trace\r\nor presumption whatever of his descent from that Achæus, whom the\r\ntradition feigns to have existed.\r\n\r\nBut with the acknowledgment of Homer’s historical authority, the credit\r\nof that tradition falls; as indeed it is etymologically self-convicted\r\nby the formation of its cardinal name Hellen.\r\n\r\nThe Achæan prominence in Homer rests on grounds sufficiently clear:\r\nover the Ionians, who appear to be not even an Hellenic race; over\r\nthe Dorians, latent in the Pylian town of Dorion, or among the sister\r\nraces of Crete, where they are as yet wholly undistinguished: over the\r\nÆolids, (for there are no Æolians,) because these are single shoots\r\nonly, while the Achæans are a branch, a principal section of the\r\nHellenic race; and also, as I think may be shown[811], because of all\r\nHellenes they appear really to have had the most normal connection with\r\nthe true fountain-head of their race.\r\n\r\nNowhere among the Dorians, and (of course, if the Ionians are\r\nPelasgian,) nowhere among the Ionians, have we any trace of the name\r\nἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, or of the thing indicated by it. May not this be the\r\nreason that the Dorian kings of Sparta sought (so to speak) to serve\r\nthemselves heirs to the house of Agamemnon?\r\n\r\nI may observe in passing, as to the Ionians, that it has recently been\r\nheld that they are not only Hellenic, but the oldest Hellenes: that\r\nthey parted from the rest of the race in Asia, came into Greece by\r\nthe islands, and were its great sea-faring race. This theory, ably as\r\nit has been supported, is but doubtfully agreeable to the positive or\r\nnegative evidence of Homer: still it is not less fatal to the current\r\ntradition of Hellen and his family, than that which views the Ionians\r\nas more nearly connected with the Pelasgians[812].\r\n\r\nOnly among Achæans, Æolids, and Dardanians, do we find the patriarchal\r\ntitle of ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν. The Dardan house fell with the Trojan war. The\r\nthrone of Augeias had given way even before that great crisis. It is\r\nprobable that the line of Euphetes was then no longer in existence;\r\nelse we must have heard of it in the Catalogue, or during the action.\r\nThe realm of Eumelus was remote and small, and if it had been wrecked\r\nin the convulsions of the period, it would leave nothing upon which the\r\nDorians could lay hold as a point of junction with the past. But they\r\nhad come into the very dominions of the family of Pelops, though with\r\na transfer of the metropolis from Mycenæ to Sparta. Here was the true\r\nGreek Patriarchate, of which for purposes of policy they might well\r\ndesire to become the ostensible representatives.\r\n\r\n_Spurious Tradition of the Hellenidæ._\r\n\r\nThe legend of the Hellenidæ might probably be meant to cooperate\r\ntowards the same end. Its determinate form I have ventured to discard:\r\nbut its spirit and intention have their importance in connection\r\nwith the subject of the extraction of the Greeks. It affords early\r\nwitness to the general belief in the derivation of the Greek races\r\nfrom Thessaly: and though it does not suffice of itself to prove that\r\na Dorus or an Ion came from thence, yet it is of great importance as a\r\ntestimony to their general connection with Thessaly, and it powerfully\r\ncorroborates evidence such as Homer affords to that effect in the\r\ncase of the Achæans. Nor are we entirely without Homeric evidence of\r\na connection between the Dorians and the Achæans, and thus between\r\nthe Dorians and Thessaly. For the Dorians are found in Crete together\r\nwith the Achæans (Od. xix.), and in the dominions of Nestor peopled by\r\nAchæans we find the town called Δώριον, Il. ii. 594. As, however, the\r\ngreat Dorian mass came into Peloponnesus not under a family of Dorian\r\nrulers, but under Heraclids, their connection with the old Hellas was\r\nnot maintained by any regal tradition, and hence perhaps the need of\r\nthe legend of Hellen to revive the memory of it.\r\n\r\nLet us now endeavour to gather together the threads of the argument.\r\n\r\nIt is plain that Agamemnon was not called ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν on account of\r\nhis great monarchy; because other great monarchs want the title, and,\r\nagain, other insignificant lords hold it.\r\n\r\nNor did he possess it on the ground of autochthonism: for the Achæans\r\nwere immigrants into the Peloponnesus, and not autochthons, and they\r\nhad been preceded by other races.\r\n\r\nNeither was it borne by him on the ground of a divine descent more\r\ndirect or more illustrious than that of others: for his divine descent\r\nwould in that case at least have been specifically stated, instead of\r\nbeing left to remote and hazardous inference. Nor is the title borne\r\nby Achilles, who was the great grandson of Jupiter, or by Hercules or\r\nMinos, who were his sons.\r\n\r\nIf sovereignty and antiquity be connected with the title, they are\r\nnot of themselves sufficient to confer it: and if divine descent be a\r\ncondition of it, this must be joined with other conditions.\r\n\r\nThese negatives, established in the case of Agamemnon, leave room, I\r\nbelieve, for but one supposition; namely, that the ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν must\r\nindicate chieftaincy, or in other words, the lineal headship, passing\r\nby seniority, of one among the ruling or royal houses, who represent\r\nthe stem of a particular race, in his case the Achæan branch of the\r\nHellenic family; and who govern, and have continuously governed, those\r\nof their own name or branch. Of these royal houses there might be\r\nmany, allied together by common derivation, at the same or different\r\nepochs, from a common stem.\r\n\r\n_Summary of the Evidence._\r\n\r\nIn sum, the Homeric picture appears to be as follows.\r\n\r\nFirst we have the remote and wintry Dodona of Thessaly, the most\r\nancient and most awful seat of the religious worship of the Greeks; in\r\nconnection with which Achilles invokes Jupiter for the success and safe\r\nreturn of Patroclus.\r\n\r\nAround Dodona dwell the Selli or Helli. The special veneration paid to\r\nthe place points it out as the oldest site of the national worship;\r\nand the possession of this oldest site again points out the tribe as\r\nthe mother-tribe of that wonderful Greek race, whose fame is graven\r\nineffaceably upon the rock with a pen of iron.\r\n\r\nFrom among the Helli of the mountains, who nowhere appear among the\r\ncontingents of the Greek army, must have proceeded the migratory bands\r\nwho gave to the Thessalian plain the name of Hellas. Their descendants\r\nfix themselves as settlers there. Beguiled into civilization, they\r\nbecome Hellenes; they spread, by their inborn elastic energies, towards\r\nthe south, and carry with them, only a little in their rear, the very\r\ntitle of their Hellenic origin, as well as their own peculiar name.\r\n\r\nThe ruling families of their septs or clans give each to its actual\r\nhead, if not to its heir, the dignity of ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, and this title\r\nthey carry forth with them to the southern provinces in which they\r\nplant themselves.\r\n\r\nOne of these ruling families, the head of the great sept of the\r\nAchæans, carries the right to this title in the case of Agamemnon: and\r\ninasmuch as it betokens what is both oldest and highest in descent and\r\nin civil authority in the whole group of the Hellenic tribes, it forms\r\nan appropriate and characteristic designation for their chief ruler and\r\nleader.\r\n\r\nHaving thus considered the case of Agamemnon, the great Achæan\r\nchieftain, in this view, we may proceed to the other cases of Anchises\r\nand Æneas, of Augeias, Euphetes, and Eumelus.\r\n\r\nIn none of these cases, however, have we the same right to assume\r\n_in limine_ the character of chieftainship by known lineage from an\r\nHellenic family, as in the case of the Achæans. The cases of Anchises\r\nand Æneas may indeed be treated on grounds of their own. In the other\r\ninstances, we must inquire what ground Homer furnishes for especially\r\nconnecting these persons with the headship of ruling families, and with\r\nHellas or Thessaly.\r\n\r\nThis I shall do, subject to the general rule, that if in any particular\r\ncase there can be found a special mark of connection with Thessaly\r\nor Hellas in or about a particular spot, it is thereupon to be\r\ninferred that in that particular place the connection was known and\r\ncommemorated. If, for example, we find at a given point an ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν,\r\nreason binds us to presume that, as the local name might show the\r\nderivation from the first seat of the race, so by this title the lineal\r\ndescent from a ruling family there was meant to be commemorated and\r\nmarked.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cases of Anchises and Æneas._\r\n\r\nBut first for Anchises and Æneas.\r\n\r\nHomer is the historian as well as the poet of Greece: but he is neither\r\nthe poet nor the historian of Troy, further than as it was necessary\r\nfor him to describe generally to the Greeks the race with whom they had\r\nbeen engaged in a death-struggle.\r\n\r\nThe strong resemblance between the two nations, and especially their\r\npartaking, to a certain extent, of a common lineage, seems to have\r\nconstituted a difficulty in his way. Already in his time the sentiment\r\nof Greek nationality was strong. Whether he chiefly found or made it\r\nso, is nothing to the present purpose. This sentiment of nationality\r\nrequired to be circumscribed by a clear line, marking the extent of\r\nthe Greek political organisation; and if it was unfavourable to the\r\nacknowledgment of relationship to any race beyond that line, especially\r\nwas it so in the case of a race that the Greeks had conquered. Probably\r\ntherefore the purpose of Homer required that he should instinctively as\r\nit were keep in special obscurity the notes of kindred between the two\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the Greeks, Homer has intelligibly pointed out the\r\norigin of the race among the hills of Northern Thessaly round the\r\nancient Dodona, and near Olympus, its poetical counterpart, and the\r\nresidence of Jupiter with his gorgeous train. Yet more clearly has\r\nhe in the case of the Trojans enabled us to trace them to their\r\nfountain-head, again in the mountains, and beside the roots, of Ida,\r\nwhere they worshipped the Idæan Jove[813]. We have here the race\r\nwithout predecessors, residing in the very spot where they were planted\r\nby their divine progenitor, and coming down by a clear line of seven\r\ngenerations to the cousins Hector and Æneas.\r\n\r\nBut although the conditions of chieftaincy are thus obviously fulfilled\r\nin the race of Dardanus, yet difficulty presents itself in a new form.\r\nWhy is the term ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν applied to Anchises and to his son Æneas,\r\nbut never to Priam, or to his son Hector, or to any of his family?\r\n\r\nThe answer to this question opens a curious chapter of Homeric history\r\nand speculation. In going through it I shall endeavour carefully to\r\nseparate between positive statement, and interpretation or conjecture.\r\n\r\nThese facts then are on the face of the poem.\r\n\r\n1. Anchises nowhere personally appears in it. And yet there was at\r\nTroy an assembly of δημογέροντες (Il. iii. 146-8). Of the persons\r\nthere mentioned, Lampus, Clytius, and Hiketaon were brothers of Priam;\r\nothers, for example, Panthus and Antenor, were in the exercise of at\r\nthe very least a subaltern sovereignty. They were present at Troy,\r\nwhile their sons fought in the Trojan ranks. The reason, therefore, of\r\nthe absence of Anchises is not to be sought in his being represented\r\nby Æneas. Nor in the immunity of his dominions, through their being\r\nplaced among the mountains, from war: for Æneas himself, before he\r\ncame to Troy, had only been rescued by divine interposition from the\r\nhands of Achilles[814]. Why then does Anchises never appear? Either\r\nsurely because of the high rank of his sovereignty, or because of some\r\nunexplained rivalry between the families.\r\n\r\n_Evidence as to Æneas._\r\n\r\n2. It does not appear that Æneas took any part in the councils of\r\nthe Trojans. But still he is always represented as a personage of\r\nthe greatest importance. It is said of him, as of Hector, θεὸς δ’ ὡς\r\nτίετο δήμῳ[815]. Yet his character would seem to be wholly unmarked\r\nby any great or striking quality, such as we find in Sarpedon and in\r\nPolydamas. Something peculiar then in his birth and position must have\r\nbeen the cause of the importance attached to him, as it is not to be\r\nfound in his personal qualities.\r\n\r\n3. Accordingly, there are clear indications of a jealousy between\r\nÆneas himself and the Trojan royal family. In the great battle of B. x.\r\n118, Deiphobus, wanting aid, goes to seek Æneas (459-61).\r\n\r\n                      τὸν δ’ ὕστατον εὗρεν ὁμίλου\r\n    ἐστάοτ’· αἰεὶ γὰρ Πριάμῳ ἐπεμήνιε δίῳ\r\n    οὕνεκ’ ἀρ’, ἔσθλον ἔοντα μετ’ ἀνδράσιν, οὔτι τίεσκεν.\r\n\r\nNow this aversion is wholly foreign to the character of Priam, which\r\nwas genial and kindly: nor can it be accounted for by any thing in the\r\nvery neutral character of Æneas. There is an opinion of some critics,\r\nthat he and Anchises had given offence by advising the restoration of\r\nHelen. This, however, seems (B. iii. 159) to have been the general\r\nwish of the δημογέροντες, to whom it is expressly ascribed; and it is\r\nAntenor, who proposes it in the Assembly; why then should it not, if\r\nit existed, be mentioned by Homer in the case of Æneas and Anchises?\r\nYet there is not the faintest reference to it. It would still,\r\nhowever, appear insufficient to account for the feeling imputed to\r\nPriam. Coupling it with the high position of Æneas, and the absence of\r\nAnchises, I cannot but think there is most probably a reference here\r\nto the headship of the family, which is designated by the term ἄναξ\r\nἀνδρῶν. Nothing could be more natural than this jealousy between the\r\nrecent and wealthy city of the plain on the one hand, and the ancient\r\nbut comparatively poor city of the hills on the other, if the ruling\r\nfamily of Dardania claimed by seniority the chieftaincy of the race.\r\n\r\n4. Another remarkable indication of the peculiar position of Æneas is\r\nafforded by the taunt of Achilles (Il. xx. 179-83),\r\n\r\n      ἦ σέ γε θυμὸς ἐμοὶ μαχέσασθαι ἀνώγει\r\n    ἐλπόμενον Τρώεσσιν ἀνάξειν ἱπποδάμοισιν\r\n    τιμῆς τῆς Πριάμου;\r\n\r\n‘But you will not get it,’ he proceeds, ‘for Priam has children of his\r\nown, and is no fool.’\r\n\r\nTo this taunt Æneas makes no reply, except by stating his genealogy,\r\nfor which Achilles had not asked. Is not this very like justifying his\r\nexpectation of the throne? or what other connecting link can be pointed\r\nout between the taunt of Achilles, and the genealogy given in answer to\r\nthe challenge it conveyed?\r\n\r\n5. While Ilion, the city of Priam, was later by several generations,\r\nprobably having been founded in the reign of Ilus, Anchises reigned in\r\nDardania, the original seat (Il. xx. 216) of the race. The fact of his\r\nsovereignty there seems to be indicated by our finding Æneas in command\r\nof the Dardanians, with two sons of Antenor, who probably served as\r\nhis lieutenants (ii. 819-23): by the connection which that passage\r\nestablishes between Anchises and the hill country, inhabited (Il. xx.\r\n216) by the Dardanians; by the division of the royal line at the point\r\nwhere the Ilian name first appears (Il. xx. 231); and by a number of\r\nplaces showing the high position in the army which Æneas held, as head\r\nof the Dardanian force.\r\n\r\n6. The rank of Æneas was without any rival or parallel in the Trojan\r\narmy, except Hector. Though strictly speaking Dardanian, he is\r\naddressed as\r\n\r\n    Αἰνεία, Τρώων βουλήφορε·\r\n\r\nHis name is often combined with that of Hector, and when so combined\r\nfrequently precedes it. Thus we have (vi. 75),\r\n\r\n    εἰ μὴ ἄρ’ Αἰνείᾳ τε καὶ Ἕκτορι εἶπε κ.τ.λ.\r\n\r\nTo this are subjoined, by Helenus, words which assign to Æneas a parity\r\nof command with Hector:\r\n\r\n    Αἰνεία τε καὶ Ἕκτορ, ἐπεὶ πόνος ὔμμι μάλιστα\r\n    Τρώων καὶ Λυκίων ἐγκέκλιται[816].\r\n\r\nIf it be thought that metrical considerations had to do with putting\r\nÆneas in these places as well as in xx. 240, before Hector, so they\r\nmight have to do with placing Ilus before Assaracus in the genealogy.\r\n\r\nIt is asserted of him by Mars in the person of Acamas, Il. v. 467,\r\n\r\n    κεῖται ἀνὴρ ὅντ’ ἶσον ἐτίομεν Ἕκτορι δίῳ,\r\n    Αἰνείας, υἱὸς μεγαλήτορος Ἀγχίσαο.\r\n\r\nLastly, we have the prophecy of Neptune that the sceptre of Dardanus\r\nshould continue in the line of Anchises (Il. xx. 302-8).\r\n\r\nAnd, as regards the application to Æneas of the title which properly\r\nbelonged to Anchises, this seems to connect itself with the practice\r\nof the heroic age as to a devolution of sovereignty, either partial or\r\ntotal, by aged men upon their heirs. We seem to find another example\r\nof this in the case of Eumelus; and the instances of Achilles, and\r\nespecially of Ulysses, are also in point.\r\n\r\n7. As the character of Æneas does not account for the jealousy felt\r\ntowards him, so neither does his conduct. He nowhere thwarts Hector by\r\nopposition, or tries him by advice that he is not inclined to take. Of\r\nthis course of proceeding we have an instance; but it is in Polydamas.\r\nIf, then, neither the character nor the conduct of Æneas supply the\r\nexplanation, we must look for it in some claims that he was entitled\r\nto make in virtue of lineage, and that consequently attracted jealousy\r\ntowards him.\r\n\r\n8. Although it has been assumed that Priam was the head of the Trojan\r\nrace and federation, this is not stated by Homer. In Il. xxiv. 544\r\nit is only said that he excelled the other princes of that region,\r\n(1) in his wealth, and (2) in the number, or possibly it may mean the\r\nexcellence of his sons. On the contrary, it is doubtful, by the mere\r\nwords of the poem, whether Priam represented the senior or the junior\r\nline, and when we compare and draw inferences from the text, we may\r\narrive at the conclusion that it was the junior line, quite as easily\r\nas at an opposite one; especially if we shall find, that the rights of\r\nseniority itself were less determinate in Troas, than in Greece.\r\n\r\nIn the genealogy of the Twentieth Book, we find no assistance towards\r\nelucidating this question, except in the precedence given to names. The\r\nthree sons of Tros stand in the following order:\r\n\r\n  1. Ilus.\r\n  2. Assaracus.\r\n  3. Ganymedes.\r\n\r\nThen (1) the fate of Ganymedes is described;\r\n\r\n(2) the line of Ilus is traced down to Priam;\r\n\r\n(3) that of Assaracus is traced to Anchises.\r\n\r\nHere the line of Priam has precedence: but on the other hand, lastly,\r\nÆneas proceeds to state his own birth from Anchises, before that of\r\nHector from Priam,\r\n\r\n    αὐτὰρ ἔμ’ Ἀγχίσης, Πρίαμος δ’ ἔτεχ’ Ἕκτορα δῖον[817].\r\n\r\n9. In the Fifth Iliad we learn, that Jupiter presented some horses\r\nof a particular breed to Tros, as a compensation for the loss of his\r\nson Ganymedes. Anchises brought his mares to them in the time of\r\nLaomedon without leave, and thus got possession of the breed. And it\r\nis in this place that Homer calls him ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν[818]. It may also\r\nbe observed that this was the act of a young man; for Laomedon, on\r\nwhom he played this trick, was one generation higher in the family\r\ntree. It is here shown undoubtedly that the horses of Tros, the common\r\nancestor, descended to the line of Priam; which was the more wealthy\r\nand powerful, and occupied the plain country, where the horses fed in\r\ngreat numbers (xx. 221); but again, does it not seem as if this very\r\nproceeding of Anchises may have had reference to a rivalry between the\r\ntwo houses, and a claim on his part to the headship of the family?\r\nespecially from the use in this very narrative of the phrase ἄναξ\r\nἀνδρῶν for Anchises (v. 268), and shortly after for his heir Æneas (v.\r\n311).\r\n\r\n_Summary of the Evidence._\r\n\r\nTo sum up the evidence. We find the phrase ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν applied to\r\ntwo persons only among the Trojans. Those two are a father advanced\r\nin years, and his heir apparent. The father is plainly enough the\r\nsovereign of Dardania, as well as descended from Dardanus; and\r\nDardania, though secondary in power, was the original seat of the race.\r\nWe cannot say positively whether Anchises represented the elder or the\r\nyounger branch of the family: for precedence of name is sometimes given\r\nto one, and sometimes to the other line. But as Troy was powerful, and\r\nDardania poor, we can understand the precedence of the Trojan line,\r\neven although it be supposed junior: whereas it seems difficult to\r\naccount for the fact that the precedence is sometimes given to Æneas,\r\nor for the jealousy felt both towards him, and by him, except on the\r\nsupposition that his family in its humbler circumstances either were\r\nthe rightful representatives of Dardanus, whose sceptre, after the\r\nfall of Troy, Æneas and his sons were undoubtedly to transmit[819]; or\r\nat least were in a condition, whether by primogeniture in Assaracus,\r\nor whether by holding the original seat of the race, to make fair and\r\nplausible pretensions to the distinction.\r\n\r\nIt is important to bear in mind, that we have not the same clear\r\nassertion of the right of the elder branch to succeed to power in Asia,\r\nwhich the cases of Agamemnon, Protesilaus, Thrasymedes, and perhaps\r\nothers, supply in Greece. On the contrary, we shall find Sarpedon\r\nfirst leader of the Lycians, though of a junior branch to Glaucus, and\r\nlikewise representing only the female line. We shall also find great\r\nreason to question whether Hector, even if he was the heir expectant\r\nof the succession, was not, nevertheless, junior to Paris. This want\r\nof definiteness in the rule of succession is exactly what would bring\r\nit into dispute, and perhaps into prolonged dispute. And if the right\r\nof seniority was not fully acknowledged in Asia, this would at once\r\nexplain, why Homer did not observe an uniform order in the genealogy:\r\nperhaps it might also explain his not being historically aware what\r\nthat order was.\r\n\r\nIf this be so, the apparent anomaly of the application, on the Trojan\r\nside, to secondary persons only of the title so constantly given to the\r\nhighest Greek, disappears, and becomes the consistent application of a\r\nrule. And Anchises with Æneas may then offer the most perfect model of\r\nthe ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, as uniting with continued sovereignty not only known\r\nlineal descent from the first ancestor, and from Jupiter, but also the\r\ncontinued possession of the original seat.\r\n\r\nIt may however be asked, why, even if we allow that ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν\r\nis among the Greeks a title of patriarchal chieftaincy, should we\r\ntherefore assume that it had the same defined meaning among a people of\r\ndifferent blood and institutions?\r\n\r\nLet me briefly answer this question.\r\n\r\nIt is to the Helli that we have looked back as the most probable\r\nsource of those ideas and institutions of clanship, which gave rise\r\nto the title of ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν. But the Helli were a mountain people,\r\n(for they were around the wintry Dodona,) and so were the Dardanians:\r\nand the institutions of highlanders in different parts, even at wide\r\nintervals of space and time, often present strong mutual resemblances.\r\nThe limited means and pursuits of man in such a physical position check\r\ndevelopment, and tend to maintain uniformity.\r\n\r\nThe Dardan highlanders worshipped Jupiter on Ida, as the Helli\r\nworshipped him at Dodona. That it was the same Jupiter, we may infer\r\nwith the greatest confidence, from the fact that Homer makes one\r\nformula of invocation common to his Trojans and his Greeks[820].\r\n\r\n    ὧδε δέ τις εἴπεσκεν Ἀχαιῶν τε Τρώων τε·\r\n    Ζεῦ πάτερ, Ἴδηθεν μεδέων, κύδιστε, μέγιστε, κ.τ.λ.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the religion was nearly the same on both sides, as far as\r\nthe principal deities were concerned.\r\n\r\n_Signs of kin between Trojans and Greeks._\r\n\r\nAs the first among the proofs of affinity in blood, I should be\r\ninclined to cite that very visit of Paris to Menelaus, which gave\r\noccasion to the war. We have no other instance recorded in Homer\r\nof a foreign prince, received as such in domestic hospitality by a\r\nGreek chieftain. Nor can we, inversely, find that Greek chieftains\r\nwere similarly entertained by foreigners. We have indeed an account\r\nof gifts received by Menelaus in Egypt[821]; and we have the kindly\r\nreception by the Egyptian king and his people of the Pseudo-Ulysses as\r\na suppliant[822]; and the similar entertainment of Ulysses, again as a\r\nsuppliant, in Scheria. But these cases fall greatly short of the case\r\nof Paris. Again, Homer calls the Egyptians ἀλλόθροοι ἄνθρωποι[823]: and\r\nthat phrase is an usual one with him, evidently representing a familiar\r\nidea. But he never calls the Trojans ἀλλόθροοι, nor speaks of them as\r\nhaving different manners or religion from the Greeks. The strongest\r\nword applied to them is ἀλλοδάπος[824]. But this word seems to mean\r\nsimply ‘from another place,’ and does not convey the proper and full\r\nidea of a foreigner. For not only the Lycian Sarpedon is an ἀλλοδάπος\r\nto the Trojans, but Greek pirates are usually said to attack ἀλλοδάποι,\r\nwhereas they evidently were wont to plunder those of their own nation,\r\neven down to the time of Thucydides: and above all Eumæus, disgusted\r\nand worn out with the profligate misdeeds of the Suitors, thinks of\r\nmoving off ἄνδρας ἐς ἀλλοδάπους, together with his oxen (ἰόντ’ αὐτῇσι\r\nβόεσσιν), by which he could not have meant more than a short passage to\r\nthe Greek continent[825]. On the whole, I think that all this permits\r\nthe supposition that the Trojans were admitted to be a kindred, though\r\nthey were not a Greek people.\r\n\r\nBut further, the poems are full of testimony to the affinities between\r\nthe Trojans and the Greeks. It is true they also bear witness to\r\nconsiderable differences: but both nations had been settled in the\r\nplain country for several generations before the Trojan War; and, with\r\nthe growth of agriculture and trade, arts and wealth, they might well\r\nhave diverged from the close parallelism of a ruder age.\r\n\r\nAt this point, however, we must call to mind some matters, which have\r\nbeen more largely discussed already.\r\n\r\nAmong these resemblances of a general character it may be observed,\r\nthat there evidently are Pelasgi on both sides of the great quarrel.\r\nThe Πελασγοὶ of the Trojans are among the ἐπίκουροι (Il. ii. 840): the\r\nΠελασγοὶ of the Greeks appear as one of the Cretan races, distinct from\r\nthe Dorians and Achæans, and probably as the first founders of those\r\nlowland settlements in Thessaly (ii. 681), over which the Hellenic and\r\nAchæan names seem principally to have prevailed. Thus the Pelasgian\r\nname forms a decided bond of union between the two races: though, from\r\nthe Poet’s mentioning it on the Trojan, and suppressing it on the Greek\r\nside, we at once infer that the Pelasgian element was stronger and more\r\npalpable among the Trojans.\r\n\r\n_Signs connected with the Helli._\r\n\r\nNext, it may be recollected that, according both to antecedent\r\nprobability and to tradition, those Helli who colonized the tract\r\nabout Dodona must have come from, that is, come by way of, Dardania.\r\nThere is thus every likelihood of a similarity, either of race or of\r\nmanners, between those who passed onwards, and those who dropped off\r\nthe movement, and remained behind.\r\n\r\nNor are there wanting some indications, small in amount, but\r\ntrustworthy in their nature, of primitive identity between the Dardans,\r\nor some portion of them, and the Helli.\r\n\r\nThe Trojan Catalogue divides itself into two principal parts. The\r\nlatter of these (840-877) recites the names of the allied nations.\r\nThe former (816-39) mentions no names of races but the Trojan and\r\nDardanian; which were really one, and were even in name sometimes\r\ntreated as identical: for Æneas is addressed, though commander of the\r\nDardans[826], as\r\n\r\n    Αἰνεία, Τρώων βουλήφορε.\r\n\r\nThis division of the Catalogue is clearly indicated by the verse which\r\nintroduces it,\r\n\r\n    ἔνθα τότε Τρῶές τε διέκριθεν ἠδ’ ἐπίκουροι·\r\n\r\nwhere the word Τρῶες evidently includes the Dardanians.\r\n\r\nAnd that every thing is Trojan, or Dardan, which lies within the\r\ndivision, vv. 816-839, may further be inferred from Dolon’s description\r\nof the bivouac of the ἐπίκουροι in Il. x. 428-31. He enumerates\r\nnine nations, some of whom appear among the eleven described in Il.\r\nii. 840-77, but not one among those portions of the force which are\r\ndescribed 816-839. I therefore gather, that every thing in this part of\r\nthe Catalogue is strictly Trojan or Dardan. But here we have\r\n\r\n    Ἄσιος Ὑρτακίδης, ὃν Ἀρίσβηθεν φέρον ἵπποι\r\n    αἴθωνες μεγάλοι, ποταμοῦ ἀπὸ Σελλήεντος.\r\n\r\nThe mention of this river is repeated in Il. xii. 96, 7.\r\n\r\nNow the name of a river Selleeis at once suggests a connection with the\r\ntribe of Selli or Helli: and further on we shall find, that Ephyre is a\r\nsign of the Helli, as Larissa is of the Pelasgi, and that one at least\r\nof the Ephyres of Greece, probably one situated in Thessaly, was by a\r\nriver Selleeis. In later times Sicyon[827], and in Homer Elis, if not\r\nThessaly, show each their Ephyre with a river Selleeis.\r\n\r\nIt has been already noticed, that in the Games of the Twenty-third\r\nIliad, Homer tells us that the σόλος, or ball of iron given by Achilles\r\nas a prize, had previously been hurled by the strong arm of king\r\nEetion. And as all the traces of gymnastic exercises in Homer lead us\r\nto refer them to Hellic families, we may perhaps be justified in taking\r\nthis as an indication that Eetion, the father of Andromache, belonged\r\nto this stock.\r\n\r\n_The Hellespont of Homer._\r\n\r\nAnother trace of the name of the Helli is found in the grammatical\r\nstructure of the ancient Homeric word Hellespont. Its composition\r\ndeclares it to be the sea of Helle. Helle would be the descriptive\r\nname of a woman of the tribe of Helli. Nor could any thing be more\r\nnatural, than that the Strait and neighbouring water should take its\r\nappellation from the tribe of Helli, or even from a person of that\r\ntribe, when we have every reason to believe they made the passage in\r\nthe course of their migration westward.\r\n\r\nIn later times, the name Hellespont has been restricted to the narrow\r\nstrait between the Sea of Marmora and the Archipelago. In Homer it bore\r\nthis sense, at least occasionally or inclusively, because he calls it\r\nἀγάῤῥοος[828]. At other times he calls it πλατὺς, and the commentators\r\nhave been much puzzled to show how a narrow strait could be a broad\r\none, while the interpretation _salt_ has also been suggested for the\r\nepithet. It is just possible, that this adjective might apply to what\r\nwas afterwards known as the Hellespont, and might describe it as broad,\r\nin comparison with the bay in which lay the Greek ships: but it is much\r\nmore natural to construe it more freely, and to understand by it the\r\nbroad Hellespont, in opposition to the narrow Hellespont; that is, the\r\nopen sea, in opposition to the ἀγάῤῥοος, which signifies the Strait.\r\nThe expression πλατὺς Ἑλλήσποντος is used but thrice; once[829] for\r\nthe water near the part of the camp occupied by Achilles, which we\r\nknow was by the open sea[830], and twice[831] with reference to the\r\nsepulchral mounds which were to be erected there, and for which the\r\nmost conspicuous spot would of course be chosen. What πλατὺς suggests,\r\nanother epithet, ἀπείρων[832], surely requires: for it is incredible\r\nthat this word should be applied to the mere Strait. And in truth,\r\nindependently of epithets, it is demonstrable that the word in Homer\r\nsometimes means, not the strait, but the Archipelago. For Achilles,\r\nannouncing his intention to sail home, says he will be seen passing\r\nἙλλήσποντον ἐπ’ ἰχθυόεντα[833], _over_ the Hellespont, which, having\r\nhis vessels already at the mouth of it, he clearly could not do if it\r\nmeant the strait only. And, in truth, the etymology of the word speaks\r\nfor itself: the Greeks never would have given the name πόντος at all\r\nto a narrow strip of water. The connection, which was thus established\r\nbetween this quarter and Greece through the medium of the name Helle,\r\nwas recognised by the later Greeks: but they naturally altered its\r\nform, by keeping to their own country the honours of the fountain-head,\r\nwhile they made the eastward traces of the name to be secondary and\r\nderivative. In Apollonius, Phryxus and Helle are the children of\r\nAthamas, and grandchildren of Æolus: and they are carried from Thessaly\r\non the back of a ram to the Troic sea, where she is dropped, and\r\ngives her name to it. This tradition is summed up in the argument to\r\nthe Argonautica, and exhibits the belief of the Greeks in the early\r\nrelationship of the countries.\r\n\r\nAll this marks the Helli not only as a people who had crossed the\r\nstraits, but as one which had left its name associated with the\r\nnorthern coast of the Ægean, and moreover upon the country in the\r\nneighbourhood of the straits, up to the river Selleeis; a stream which\r\nwe see must have been at a considerable distance beyond Troy, because\r\nall the rivers that descended from Mount Ida were employed in clearing\r\naway the Greek earthworks, and this one is not among them[834].\r\n\r\n_The gift of Echepolus._\r\n\r\nWe find an insulated yet remarkable note of kin between the Dardan\r\nhouse and the Greeks in the case of Echepolus. He was a son of\r\nAnchises, and he resided in Sicyon. He was possessed of great wealth,\r\nand apparently he had also the fine breed of horses which was in his\r\nfamily: for he presented Agamemnon with the mare Αἴθη[835], as a\r\nconsideration for not being required to follow him against Troy.\r\n\r\nNow there was evidently at this time no commercial class formed in\r\nGreece. Echepolus must therefore have had a territorial fortune. To\r\nfind a wealthy member of the Dardan house domesticated in Greece, and\r\npeacefully remaining there during the expedition, must excite some\r\nsurprise. It seems to supply a new and strong presumption of the Hellic\r\norigin of the royal families of Troas. The name too, and the gift\r\nof a horse, are in remarkable conformity with the horse-rearing and\r\nhorse-breaking pursuits of the highest Trojans.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen stray signs of the Pelasgic affinities between\r\nthe two contending parties: but it would now appear, that there were\r\naffinities in the Hellic line also: and if so, then this institution of\r\nchieftaincy, standing above merely political supremacy, and indicated\r\nby the phrase ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, may probably have subsisted among Trojans as\r\nwell as Greeks.\r\n\r\nThe less warlike character of the Trojans, their more oriental\r\nmanners, and their less multiform and imaginative religion, all point\r\nto considerable differences in the composition of the people. The\r\nPelasgic ingredient was probably stronger in Troy: it appears to have\r\nhad more influence over religion, manners, and institutions. But the\r\ncircumstances mentioned above are tokens of an infusion of Hellic\r\nblood in the populations that inhabited Troas. Now this was nowhere so\r\nlikely to be found as in the royal family; for we see the governing\r\nfaculty everywhere accompanying the Hellic tribes through Greece, and\r\nasserting itself both by the acquisition of political power, and by the\r\nenergetic use of it. Everywhere it rises, by a natural buoyancy, to the\r\nsummit of society; and gives their first vent, in miniature, to those\r\nenergies, which were afterwards to defy, or even to subdue the world.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, though it is in connection with the Hellic families\r\nalone that we find the ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν among the Greeks, we need not\r\nproceed so far as to deny the possibility that it might also have been\r\na Pelasgic institution, and that its non-appearance, in connection with\r\ntheir name, might be sufficiently accounted for simply by their loss\r\nof political power. We have no reason to suppose the Pelasgi and Helli\r\nto have been families of mankind whose characters were in radical and\r\nabsolute opposition to one another: the completeness of their fusion\r\nafter a short period seems to prove, that, though with a different\r\ndistribution of capacities and tendencies, they must have had many and\r\nimportant points of contact.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. _Case of Augeias._\r\n\r\nLet us take next the case of Augeias.\r\n\r\nHe appears in three passages of the Iliad.\r\n\r\n1. The Epeans, who inhabited Elis, with Bouprasium and other towns\r\nenumerated in the Catalogue, and lying in the north-western corner\r\nof the Peloponnesus, sent to the Trojan war forty ships, in four\r\ndivisions, under four separate leaders, and without any head over\r\nthe whole contingent. The fourth named of these is Polyxeinus, son of\r\nAgasthenes, himself a lord (ἄναξ), and the son of Augeias.\r\n\r\n2. In the Eleventh Book, Nestor gives the curious history of the war of\r\nhis boyhood or earliest youth, between the Elians (v. 671), called also\r\nEpeans (688), and the Pylians.\r\n\r\nNeleus had sent to Elis a chariot with four horses to contend in the\r\ngames, of which a tripod was the prize. The horses were detained by\r\nAugeias (v. 701).\r\n\r\n            τοὺς δ’ αὖθι ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν Αὐγείας\r\n    κάσχεθε.\r\n\r\nNestor and the Pylians invaded Elis in return, and brought off an\r\nimmense booty. The Elians then took arms and besieged Thryoessa (in\r\nthe Catalogue Thryon), the border city of Pylos, at the ford of the\r\nAlpheus. Minerva brought the tidings to Pylos. The Pylian forces spent\r\none night on the boundary river Minyeius, and marched to the Alpheus,\r\nbeside which they spent a second night.\r\n\r\n3. In the morning the battle was fought: the Epeans were defeated,\r\nand driven all the way to Bouprasium and the Olenian rock, upon the\r\nsea shore, in the western part of what was afterwards Achæa. There\r\nPallas turned them back. The Pylians, who returned home, are called\r\nAchæans[836].\r\n\r\nNestor in the first fight had slain a warrior named Μούλιος. He was the\r\nson-in-law of Augeias, married to his eldest daughter Agamede, who was\r\nprofoundly skilled in drugs (v. 741);\r\n\r\n    ἣ τόσα φάρμακα ᾔδη, ὅσα τρέφει εὐρεῖα χθών.\r\n\r\nK. O. Müller (Orchomenus, p. 355) infers from the Catalogue, that\r\nAugeias was lord only of a fourth part of Elis. But this assumption\r\nseems quite gratuitous in connection with the passage in the Catalogue,\r\nand utterly in contradiction to the tenour of the history of the Pylian\r\nraid in B. xi. On the contrary, I infer with considerable confidence,\r\nfrom the acephalous state of the Elian division of the army, in which\r\nit differs from the other divisions, that there had been a revolution\r\nin that state since the time of Augeias; and if so, then indirectly the\r\nCatalogue confirms the Elian monarchy described in the Eleventh Book.\r\n\r\nThus then we find this ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, Augeias, lord of Elis two\r\ngenerations before the Trojan war. He is neighbour to Achæans, whom\r\nwe have already traced in Hellas: and he appears to have belonged to\r\nthe same national origin with them, because they sent their chariots\r\nto run races at his games. Again, the fact of his holding these games\r\nat all, and at a place which subsequently contended for and obtained\r\nthe superintendence of the great national assemblages celebrated at\r\nOlympia, testifies to his known connection with the cradle of the\r\nrace whose custom it was to celebrate them; because these festivities\r\nhad a religious and national character, and as such could not but\r\nhave depended very greatly upon traditionary title. This race we have\r\npreviously found to be the Hellenic race.\r\n\r\n_Notes of connection between Elis and the North._\r\n\r\nWe may however find other indications of the descent of Augeias\r\nfrom a ruling Hellenic family, in local and personal notices which\r\nconnect Elis, his own territory, with the north, and with Thessaly in\r\nparticular.\r\n\r\nFor example: it was at the Alpheus in Elis that Thamyris suffered his\r\ncalamity: and he was coming at the time from Œchalia[837], in the\r\nvalley of the Upper Peneus, a part of the Homeric Thessaly or Hellas\r\nproper. (Il. ii. 730.)\r\n\r\nThe name Θρῂξ, too, which is applied to him, never seems to have spread\r\nfarther southwards than the hills about Thessaly.\r\n\r\nFurther, he was coming from Eurytus of Œchalia, who is again named as\r\nthe lord, apparently, of that city, in ii. 730. But the name Eurytus\r\nwas one current among the descendants of Actor[838], for a descendant\r\nof Actor who bore it is named in the Catalogue a little below: and this\r\nlatter Eurytus was an Epean chief: and the descendants of Actor are\r\nfound in the Epean or Elian army of the Eleventh Book. (xi. 709, 739.)\r\n\r\nAgain, they are found in Thessaly or Phthiotis, for when Mercury had\r\ndeflowered Polymele, the daughter of Phylas a Thessalian, Echecles,\r\na descendant of Actor, married her; and yet again, they are found\r\nnear Aspledon[839] and the Minyeian Orchomenos, between Bœotia and\r\nPhocis[840].\r\n\r\nAgain, the Pylian army halted, at a day’s march from the Alpheus, on\r\nthe Minyeius, a river evidently named from the Minyæ of Peloponnesus.\r\nBut there was a Minya also in Thessaly[841], of which the site was not\r\nprecisely known in historic times: and the northern Orchomenos was\r\ncalled Minyeius[842].\r\n\r\nThere is no part of Middle or of Southern Greece which so abounds in\r\nthe local and personal notes of connection with Thessaly and the North\r\nas Elis and its neighbourhood. Some indications of it have already been\r\ngiven, and many more might be added. As for example, there was an\r\nEnipeus[843], a river of Elis, so there was of Pieria and of Phthiotis.\r\nDoris, beneath Œta, is reflected or prefigured in the Homeric Dorium\r\nof the Pylian territories: the Thessalian Larissa in a Larissa, and a\r\nriver Larissus, of Elis. The Thessalian name Œchalia is repeated in the\r\ndistrict, over which Nestor ruled at the epoch of the _Troica_; and\r\nthere is an Arcadian Orchomenos as well as a northern one. Cyparissus\r\nin Elis corresponds, again, with a Cyparissus in Phocis. Some other\r\nmore doubtful indications may close the list. The Parrhasie of Arcadia\r\nmay be from the same root with the Πύρασος[844] of the dominions of\r\nProtesilaus. Perhaps the Thessalian Helos and Pteleos may be akin to\r\nAlos in the country of Peleus[845]. The resemblance of names is not\r\nconfined to the extremities of the line, but is scattered along the\r\npath of migration from north to south. It extends also to Laconia.\r\n\r\nNestor in his youth is summoned all the way from Pylos (τηλόθεν), to\r\nfight with Pirithous and others in Thessaly; (from whence Polypœtes,\r\nthe son of Pirithous, led a division of the Greek army,) against the\r\nΦῆρες.\r\n\r\nThus far we find some presumptions as to the descent of Augeias, as to\r\nhis connection with the Hellic institution of the games, and as to the\r\nrelation between Elis, over which he reigned, and the line northwards\r\ninto Thessaly; all tending, together with the evidently Hellic\r\ncharacter of the Epeans, to shew that he was the representative of one\r\nof their ruling tribes.\r\n\r\nBut he also bears a distinct local mark, the nature of which I shall\r\nnow endeavour to investigate.\r\n\r\nThe chieftainship of Agamemnon has been traced and identified by\r\nmeans of his Achæan connection, without any assistance from local or\r\nterritorial names connected with the abode of his family.\r\n\r\nIn such a case as his, we could not look for aid of that description:\r\nfor his house had only been possessed for two generations of their\r\ndominions: we have no precise knowledge before that time of the place\r\nof their sojourn: and when they rose to power, it was in a territory,\r\nand in cities, which appear to have been already of historic fame. It\r\nwas not therefore likely that their abodes should bear names such as,\r\nif they had come in the characters of founders and not of inheritors,\r\nthey would probably have affixed to them.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the Dardan house, we have found, among other indications\r\nof their Hellic affinities, the two evidently Hellic names of the\r\nHellespont and the River Selleeis.\r\n\r\n_The name of Ephyre._\r\n\r\nThere is another local name in Homer of paramount importance as a key\r\nto the question respecting the ruling Hellic tribes, the name of Ephyre\r\n(Ἐφύρη).\r\n\r\nLet us endeavour to collect the scattered lights which either the\r\netymology, or the use and associations of the term in Homer, may supply.\r\n\r\n_Its cognate names._\r\n\r\nAnd, first, we may notice in Homer a large cluster of names which are\r\nfound running over Greece, and which are evidently in etymological\r\nassociation with one another: I will bring these together, before\r\nendeavouring to estimate their relation to the name Ephyre.\r\n\r\n1. Φᾶρις, Il. ii. 582. In Lacedæmon.\r\n\r\n2. Φεραὶ, Il. ii. 711. In Thessaly.\r\n\r\n3. Φήρη, Il. v. 543. Between Pylus and Sparta.\r\n\r\n4. Φήραι, Il. ix. 151, 293. Od. iii. 488. The same.\r\n\r\n5. Φεαὶ, Od. xv. 296[846]. Otherwise read Φεραὶ, and, according to the\r\nScholiast, the same with Φῆραι. The site is on the sea, between Pylus\r\nand Sparta.\r\n\r\n6. Φεῖα, Il. vii. 135. On the Iardanus: and probably also on\r\nthe Arcadian frontier towards Pylus: but, in the opinion of the\r\nScholiast[847], the same with Φεαί.\r\n\r\nBesides these names of places, we have also,\r\n\r\n1. Φηρητιάδης, Il. ii. 763. xxiii. 376, the name of Eumelus; who was\r\nthe son of Admetus, the lord of Φεραὶ in Il. ii. 711.\r\n\r\n2. Φέρης, one of the sons of Cretheus, a Thessalian king, Od. xi. 259.\r\n\r\n3. The Φῆρες, termed ὀρέσκῳοι in Il. i. 268, and λαχνηέντες in Il. ii.\r\n743; the shaggy mountaineers, on whom Pirithous made war, when he was\r\nattended by Nestor.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the six local names, and the two first of the three\r\npersonal names, there can be little doubt of their identity in root.\r\nIt is directly probable from the text, that Φήρη and Φηραὶ were the\r\nsame place. The name of Eumelus, who lives at Φεραὶ, and who is the\r\ngrandson of Φέρης, yet is called Φηρητιάδης, clearly establishes the\r\netymological relationship. Thus there is, again, no difficulty whatever\r\nin recognising between Φεραὶ and Φεαὶ, or again between Φεαὶ and Φείαι;\r\nand it is in the manner of Homer to give the name of the same country\r\nboth in the singular and in the plural, as Μυκήνη, Il. iv. 52, and\r\nΜυκηναὶ, Il. ii. 569. Φᾶρις, the only remaining name, gives us the\r\nDoric or Æolic α for η, and an altered form of declension. This however\r\nis not at all incompatible with the manner of Homer, who not only uses\r\nΠηνελόπη and Πηνελόπεια, Ἀστυόχη and Ἀστυόχεια, Πηρείη (according\r\nto one reading), Il. ii. 766, and Πιερίη, Od. v. 50, but Ἑρμῆς and\r\nἙρμείας, Πατροκλέης and Πατρόκλος; and for towns, the Θρύον of Il. ii.\r\n591 appears again as Θρυόεσσα in Il. xi. 711.\r\n\r\nIn general it is to be remembered that the instrument of language, at\r\nthe time when Homer lived was as yet in a highly elastic state: it was\r\nin the state as it were of gristle; it had not yet hardened into bone,\r\nnor assumed the strict conventional forms which a formed literature\r\nrequires. And for the same reasons that it has presented variations as\r\nbetween one time and another, it could not but do the like as between\r\none place and another.\r\n\r\nThe very same causes which made change a law of language would give to\r\nthat course of change in one place a greater, and in another a less\r\nvelocity, older forms succumbing at a given time in one place, and yet\r\nsurviving in another. Such a state of facts around him would give great\r\nliberty to a poet, independently of the exigencies of his verse; which\r\nappear indeed to have caused to such a man, and with such a language,\r\nlittle difficulty.\r\n\r\nBut we hardly require the benefit of these general considerations to\r\ncover the case of a varying declension for the name of a town. The true\r\nexplanation probably is the very simple one, that in one declension it\r\nhas been used substantively, and in the other adjectively. And this\r\nwill be the more plain if we consider that the name of the town would\r\nusually be the representative of an idea, either in conjunction with a\r\nperson, or directly. Thus θρύον is _a rush_, and θρυοεὶς _rushy_. The\r\ntown Θρύον in the Catalogue is at the ford of the Alpheus, and in Il.\r\nxi. 711 it is τις Θρυόεσσα πόλις, αἰπεῖα κολώνη, which exhibits to us\r\nthe adjective use in an actual example. So again by analogy we might\r\nhave Φῆρις from Φήρα or Φήρη, as πάτρις from πάτρα, ἀναλκὶς from ἄλκη.\r\n\r\nWe have a curious extra-Homeric remnant of geographical evidence with\r\nrespect to this Pharis. Pausanias[848] relates to us, that the place\r\nwhere it was reported to have stood was in his time called Alesiæ, and\r\nthat near it there was a river bearing the peculiar name of Phellias;\r\nwhich it seems most natural to regard as a corrupted form of the\r\nHomeric name Σελληείς. This connection of Pharis with Selleeis becomes\r\nin its turn an argument for relationship between Pharis and Ephyre,\r\nwith which Selleeis is associated in the places where Homer mentions it\r\nas the name of a Greek river.\r\n\r\nNor are we without other traces, in this region, of that name which so\r\noften attends upon Ephyre: for Laconia had for its key on the north the\r\ntown of Sellasia[849]. The Προέληνοι of Arcadia should also here be\r\nborne in mind.\r\n\r\nThus then we appear to find the name of Ephyre according to one or\r\nother of its forms in Laconia, in Pylus, and in that part of Thessaly\r\nwhich was ruled by Admetus. The ruling race in the two former was\r\nAchæan, and therefore Hellic. Admetus was himself an ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, and\r\nhis Hellic origin will be shown presently. So far, therefore, we have a\r\npresumption established that the name of Ephyre signifies some peculiar\r\nconnection with the Helli.\r\n\r\nEtymologically it is obvious to connect these words with ἔρα as their\r\nroot, and to suppose that they retain the prefix, which it had lost in\r\nthe common Greek usage even before the days of Homer, as he employs\r\nἔραζε without the digamma: and which prefix we find reproduced in the\r\nLatin _terra_.\r\n\r\n_The Φῆρες._\r\n\r\nLet us now pass on to the Φῆρες.\r\n\r\nThe Φῆρες of Homer are, like the Ἕλλοι, a mountain people, Il. i. 268,\r\nrude in manners (ii. 743), and aggressive upon the inhabitants of the\r\nplains; for the war in which Nestor engaged was evidently retributive,\r\nas the expression used is ἐτίσατο[850], Pirithous ‘_paid them off_;’\r\nand he was sovereign of a part of the plain country, called Pelasgic\r\nArgos. Nor does any adverse presumption arise from our finding a Hellic\r\ntribe (if such they were) of the mountains, making war on tribes of\r\nsimilar origin in the plain: any more than we are surprised at war\r\nbetween the Pylians and the Epeans, both apparently Hellic, though\r\nprobably not both Achæan.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to remember, that the Dardans of Homer are often\r\nincluded in Trojans; as well as often separately designated: and that\r\nthe Cephallenians are also apparently included among his Ἀχαιοί.\r\nNeither of these pairs of names are territorial: while in each pair one\r\nprobably indicates a subdivision of the other.\r\n\r\nThe Φῆρες thus resembling the Ἕλλοι, we are led by their designation\r\nto another link between the name of Φῆραι with its cognates and the\r\nHellic race. It seems thus far as if Φηραὶ were the appropriate name of\r\na settlement formed by Φῆρες.\r\n\r\nHaving proceeded thus far, we may now observe the relation of the word\r\nΦὴρ,\r\n\r\n1. To the Greek ἔρα, which evidently, from its passing into the Latin\r\n_terra_, had at one time a Greek prefix. With this we may probably\r\nassociate the Greek ἔαρ, and the Latin _ver_.\r\n\r\n2. To the Greek θὴρ, a wild beast.\r\n\r\n3. To the Latin _fera_, with the same meaning.\r\n\r\n4. To the Latin _terra_, meaning the earth.\r\n\r\n5. To the Italian _terra_, the old classical name, in that beautiful\r\ntongue, not for a district, but for an inclosed, walled, or fortified\r\nplace. This word seems in Italian to be rarely, if at all, used for a\r\ndistrict, but so generally for a town, that it is difficult to suppose\r\nthe signification was derived in the same manner as Argos in Greek,\r\nfrom the tract of country in which it was situated. In Italian _terra_\r\nseems often to mean _tellus_, often _humus_, very rarely _ager_,\r\nconstantly _oppidum_ or _castrum_. Thus in Dante (Inferno, C., v. 97),\r\n‘_Siede_ la terra, dove nata fui.’\r\n\r\nThis being so, it is natural to suppose that, while the correlative\r\nof the Greek ἔρα became in Latin _terra_, so as directly to signify\r\n_tellus_ or _humus_, that of the Greek Φηρὰ became in Italian _terra_,\r\nso as to signify a walled place; or, in other words, that the original\r\nword, whatever it was, of the common mother language, which became Φηρὰ\r\nin Greek, in Italy became _terra_ for this latter purpose. The exchange\r\nof θ for _t_ we see in ἐσθὴς becoming _vestis_: and of _t_ for _f_ (=\r\nφ) in τρυγάω compared with _fruges_.\r\n\r\nThis sense of _terra_ seems to have dropped altogether out of the\r\nLatin, and especially Pelasgian, branch of the old Italian tongue.\r\n\r\nThe relation between Φὴρ and θὴρ, the one applicable to men, and the\r\nother to wild beasts, appears evidently to throw us back upon that\r\nwhich the mountain tribes of men had in common with animals, namely, a\r\nwild and savage life, and the free possession of the earth. Thus the\r\ntwo stand in a common and near relation to the word ἔρα, the earth, and\r\nthey seem to have ἐρ or ἠρ for their common root.\r\n\r\nBefore passing on to Ἐφύρη, I would remark that in this instance again\r\nwe seem to derive light from Homer’s unequalled point and precision\r\nin the use of epithets. His Φῆρες appear to be in fact the rude and\r\nuncombed mountaineers, who also have the name of Ἕλλοι in the same or\r\nother tribes. These Φῆρες are λαχνηέντες, shaggy. They come down to\r\nthe plains, and acquire settled and civilised habits: from Φῆρες they\r\nare become Ἀχαιοὶ, but their long hair has not left them, and from\r\nλαχνηέντες they are now καρηκομόωντες.\r\n\r\nNow we find the word Ἐφύρη used many times in Homer: and once we have\r\nthe name Ἔφυροι, applied to a people apparently Thessalian, on whom\r\nMars[851], with his son Φόβος, makes war from out of Thrace.\r\n\r\n_Etymology of Ἐφύρη._\r\n\r\nCan we then presume an etymological connection between the word Ἐφύρη,\r\nand that group of words which we have been discussing, and which we\r\nhave found to show marks of connection with the Helli?\r\n\r\nFor if so, then we shall be supported by various other reasons, which,\r\nas we shall find, connect the word Ephyre with the Hellic races in a\r\nvery remarkable manner.\r\n\r\nWhat we have here to consider is,\r\n\r\n1. The prefix ε.\r\n\r\n2. The change of ε or η for υ.\r\n\r\nDr. Donaldson[852] has given a list of Greek words which have, as\r\nprefixes unconnected with the root, sometimes the letter α, sometimes\r\nε, sometimes ο.\r\n\r\nSuch in the second class are\r\n\r\n  ἐ-ρέφω, whence roof.\r\n  ἐ-λεύθερος, whence liber.\r\n  ἐ-ρυθρὸς, whence ruber, rufus.\r\n  ἐ-ρετμὸς, whence remus.\r\n\r\nThis point being disposed of, how are we to account for finding φυρη,\r\ninstead of φερη or φηρη?\r\n\r\nCan it be because, in cases of Greek syllabic augment, there is a\r\ntendency to avoid reduplication, as in ἀτιτάλλω for ἀτατάλλω? In but\r\na small proportion of the cases given in Dr. Donaldson’s table is the\r\nvowel prefix the same with the vowel following.\r\n\r\nCan it be from that tendency of what we call comprehensively the\r\ndigamma to lapse into the υ, which Heyne has observed[853]?\r\n\r\nOr, shall we found it on the principles laid down by Bopp[854], in his\r\nComparative Grammar, that the α has a tendency to weaken itself into υ,\r\nand that liquids having a preference for that latter vowel, influence\r\nthe generation of it? the conditions of interchange between α and υ\r\nresting, as he says, upon the laws of gravity or vocal equilibrium.\r\n\r\nIt must be observed that the original vowel of the root may, in this\r\ncase, have been the α which we find in φᾶρις.\r\n\r\nIt is not only α that we may find supplanted by υ. The ε suffers the\r\nsame fate in the Italian _Siculus_, which appears as the representative\r\nof the Greek Σίκελος. Again we have, in the Latin, the kindred words\r\n_furo_ and _fera_. Perhaps I am wrong in dealing thus scrupulously\r\nwith the variation from ε to υ, as if capable of affecting vitally the\r\nquestion of identity in the root. For in examining another root (that\r\nof κεφάλη), we have seen that its derivatives appear to include the\r\nwhole, or nearly the whole range of the vowels of the alphabet.\r\n\r\n_Its probable signification._\r\n\r\nUpon the whole it appears not unsafe, without pretending to any\r\nauthoritative solution of a question fitted for philological scholars,\r\namong whom I cannot pretend to rank, to suppose that Ἐφύρη and Φηραὶ\r\nmay be drawn etymologically from the same root. If so, that root will\r\nbe probably the same with that of ἔρα, and of φῆρ of which we have\r\nascertained that it is related to the Hellic races: and upon these\r\nsuppositions we may already be prepared, I do not say to conclude, but\r\nto suspect that Ἐφύρη and Φεραὶ may properly denote, and may be the\r\noriginal and proper Hellic name for the _terre_ (Ital.), or walled\r\nplaces, founded by the Hellic races; as Ἄργος signifies the open\r\ndistricts in which the Pelasgians were given to settling κωμηδὸν, for\r\nagricultural purposes.\r\n\r\nI do not mean by this that the Pelasgian settlements contained no\r\naggregations of houses, or that the Hellic were not connected with the\r\ncultivation of the soil. On the contrary, as the Pelasgians apparently\r\nbuilt their Larissas for defence, so we seem to have indications\r\nconnecting the name Ephyre with a fertile soil. When Homer represents\r\nthe Ἔφυροι as objects of invasion by Mars from Thrace, he probably\r\nmeans by the name the inhabitants of a settled country in the plains,\r\non whom predatory incursions were made by the Thracian highlanders.\r\nSo that if we shall succeed in shewing a special connection between\r\nthe local name Ephyre and the Hellic tribes, we may, by the reflected\r\nlight of that conclusion, even venture to understand the word Ephyri\r\nas meaning Helli, who had come down into the low country, made\r\nsettlements, and acquired something at least of the habits of civilized\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nNor are we without further Homeric evidence to the effect that,\r\nwherever an Ephyre is found, there is usually an abundance of rich\r\npasture and cultivable land, so that the name is well adapted to mark\r\nthose spots which a conquering race would be apt to choose for its\r\nabodes.\r\n\r\nFor example, Elis has its Ephyre: and from the fact that Elis was the\r\nscene of the national chariot-races, we might at once conclude that it\r\nwas famous for its horses, and if so, that it abounded in good soil\r\nand pasture, and in open country. Wherever in Homer we find the horse\r\nconspicuous, we find also good lands and opulence, whether it be in\r\nTroas, in the Thrace called ἐριβώλαξ[855], in Thessaly, or in Elis.\r\nFor Homer gives us, as to the last, direct evidence of the fact, by\r\nhis epithets εὐρύχορος, open, and ἱππόβοτος, horse-pasturing[856].\r\nElis, in fact, was most probably for Peloponnesus what Bœotia was for\r\nMiddle Greece: the first halting place, from its fertile soil, of those\r\nwho entered the region; the scene, accordingly, of rapid successions,\r\nand therefore frequent revolutions, but also the place bearing the\r\nstrongest marks, through nomenclature, of the country from which the\r\nnew-comers had proceeded.\r\n\r\nAgain, the Ephyre of the Odyssey is expressly called (Od. ii. 328),\r\nπίειραν ἄρουραν. And when Hercules took Astyoche from Ephyre (Il. ii.\r\n659), after despoiling that with many other cities, we may clearly\r\ninfer, that they were rich, and not poor places which he plundered,\r\ntherefore that this Ephyre also was rich, and if so, rich in its soil,\r\nthe only wealth, for regions, then known to Greece. Again, the Ephyre\r\nof Sisyphus (Il. vi. 152) became Corinth, and Corinth was even in\r\nHomer’s time called ἄφνειος. This epithet is referred by some to its\r\nfavourable position for commerce. But such an explanation is wholly\r\nunsuited to the age of Homer. For the commercial prominence of Corinth\r\nbelongs to a later period; and we have nothing to support the idea,\r\nthat commercial opulence existed in Greece at this period at all. The\r\nnatural explanation seems to be, the fertility of the soil of the plain\r\nbetween the rock of Corinth and Sicyon. This seems to have become, in\r\nafter-time, the subject of a proverb. Hence the χρησμόλογος in the Aves\r\nof Aristophanes says (Av. 968),\r\n\r\n    ἀλλ’ ὅταν οἰκήσωσι λύκοι πολιαί τε κορώναι\r\n    ἐν ταυτῷ τὸ μεταξὺ Κορίνθου καὶ Σικυῶνος.\r\n\r\nIn the same sense as where Shakespeare says,\r\n\r\n    When Birnam wood shall move to Dunsinane.\r\n\r\nThe Scholiast gives two explanations, of which the best is εὔφορος γὰρ\r\nαὕτη ἡ χώρα.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is certainly confirmatory of the supposition that Ἐφύρη\r\nwas the name of the primitive Hellic, as Ἄργος was of the Pelasgic\r\nsettlement, when we find that the first, though clearly meaning\r\na settled place, has etymologically no reference to agricultural\r\nlabour, while the second is entirely based upon that idea; since\r\nthese significations of the word chosen to denote settlement, in the\r\ntwo cases agree, in their reciprocal difference, with the different\r\nspecific character of the Hellic and Pelasgic tribes, the former\r\nemerging from the mountains, predatory and poor, ardent, bold, and\r\nenterprising; the latter peaceful in their habits, and looking to\r\nnothing beyond the cultivation of the soil.\r\n\r\nSo much for the root of Ephyre and Pheræ, and for the relation between\r\nthe two.\r\n\r\n_Places bearing the name in Homer._\r\n\r\nNow the Homeric testimony to the prevalence of these names is exactly\r\nsuch as most effectually establishes the connection between them on the\r\none hand, and Thessaly with the Hellic races on the other.\r\n\r\nFirst as to Ephyre.\r\n\r\n1. Five generations before the Trojan war, Sisyphus, a son or\r\ndescendant of Æolus, was settled, apparently as a subordinate prince\r\nor lord, in an Ephyre, which was near the territory of Prœtus, and\r\nwas situated μύχῳ Ἄργεος ἱπποβότοιο. Bellerophon, the grandson of\r\nSisyphus, was driven out by Prœtus, king of the Argives; and was a\r\nξεῖνος of Œneus, the ancestor of Diomed. These circumstances, combined\r\nwith the tradition that attached the name of Ephyre to the site of\r\nCorinth, leave no doubt that Homer means to place Sisyphus in what was\r\nafterwards Corinth[857]. There was no other known Ephyre in a nook of\r\nἌργος, or what may be termed within reach of Prœtus and Œneus: whereas\r\nthis Ephyre lay upon the pass that communicated with the North from\r\nthat part of the Peloponnesus.\r\n\r\nBut the line of Sisyphus had been displaced in the person of\r\nBellerophon, two generations before the Trojan war. Together with this\r\nline the old name of Ephyre had disappeared: we hear of it in the Iliad\r\nonly as Corinth, and as part of the Mycenian dominions. Now tradition\r\nconnects the Æolid title particularly with Thessaly, the Æolids always\r\nhaving been recognised as one of the great primitive Greek races. And\r\nHomer gives us Æolids in Thessaly, as well as in Peloponnesus. In the\r\ntime of Sisyphus then we see this Æolid name, which is Eteo-Hellenic,\r\nconjoined with the local name Ephyre: at the epoch of the Trojan war,\r\nboth have disappeared from the spot.\r\n\r\nThe traditional name Ephyre remained, indeed, in many parts of Greece\r\ndown to later times. Strabo (p. 338) reckons one in Elis, one in\r\nThesprotia, and one in Thessaly, besides Corinth: and also five κωμαὶ\r\nof the name. But even in Homer’s time, either these settlements had\r\ndecayed, or else, which is more likely, the particular form Ἐφύρη had\r\nnever acquired the precise force of a proper name, but remained rather\r\nin the category of a descriptive word: for otherwise it could hardly\r\nhave happened, but that one or other of the Ephyres must have been\r\nnamed in the Catalogue of Homer. If a descriptive word, it was in all\r\nlikelihood simply descriptive of primitive settlement for the Hellic\r\nrace. Probably these Ἐφύραι were rude and small; and were, properly\r\nspeaking, collections of a few buildings, rather than cities regularly\r\nformed.\r\n\r\n2. That passage of the Thirteenth Iliad has already been mentioned,\r\nwhich places this name in the North. The Poet says, speaking of Mars\r\nand his son Φόβος,\r\n\r\n    τὼ μὲν ἄρ’ ἐκ Θρῄκης Ἐφύρους μέτα θωρήσσεσθον,\r\n    ἠὲ μετὰ Φλέγυας μεγαλήτορας[858].\r\n\r\nTwo circumstances warrant our placing these Ἔφυροι in Thessaly: the\r\nfirst, that the name of Thrace does not extend farther southward: and\r\nthe second, that here is the only known seat of the Phlegyæ.\r\n\r\n3. It may be convenient next to take the Ephyre, which is mentioned\r\ntwice in the Odyssey.\r\n\r\nIn the first of these passages Pallas, in the character of Mentes, Lord\r\nof the Taphians, remembers Ulysses in the days when he undertook other\r\njourneys before his Trojan one: remembers him,\r\n\r\n    ἐξ Ἐφύρης ἀνίοντα παρ’ Ἴλου Μερμερίδαο.\r\n    ᾤχετο γὰρ καὶ κεῖσε θοῆς ἐπὶ νηὸς Ὀδυσσεὺς\r\n    φάρμακον ἀνδροφόνον διζήμενος[859].\r\n\r\nAnd again, when the Suitors apprehend that Telemachus meditates\r\nmischief, they ask whether he will bring allies from Pylus, or even\r\nfrom Sparta (which was more remote).\r\n\r\n    ἤ τινας ἐκ Πύλου ἄξει ἀμύντορας ἠμαθόεντος\r\n    ἢ ὅγε καὶ Σπάρτηθεν, ἐπεί νύ περ ἵεται αἰνῶς·\r\n    ἠὲ καὶ εἰς Ἐφύρην ἐθέλει, πίειραν ἄρουραν·\r\n    ἐλθεῖν, ὄφρ’ ἔνθεν θυμοφθόρα φάρμακ’ ἐνείκῃ[860].\r\n\r\nFor several reasons it appears probable that the Ephyre here meant was\r\nin Elis, and was therefore the Ephyre of Augeias.\r\n\r\n1. Geographically it would appear likely to be in the Peloponnesus.\r\nTelemachus was little likely to make any more extended voyage. The\r\nintercourse of his family was generally with the Iasian Argos, or\r\nWestern Peloponnesus. Hence it is said of Penelope[861], ‘Could all\r\nthe Achæans of Iasian Argos see thee.’ And hence, in the Twenty-fourth\r\nOdyssey[862], the enemies of Ulysses anticipate that, unless prevented\r\nby them, he will resort either to Pylus or to Elis, where are the\r\nEpeans, for assistance. Hence, again, it is that, in the Second\r\nOdyssey, we find Ephyre joined with Pylus and Sparta (which last is\r\nmentioned as an extreme point, ἢ ὅγε καὶ Σπάρτηθεν,) as the quarters\r\nto which he might repair for aid. The names of Elis and the Epeans do\r\nnot appear: and this of itself amounts nearly to a demonstration that\r\nEphyre not only lay in, but actually stands in lieu of, Elis in this\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nWe may however note one or two secondary points.\r\n\r\n2. Corinth had now lost the name of Ephyre, that is to say, a new name\r\nhad overshadowed the old one. But this Ephyre, if not Corinth, could\r\nonly be the Elian Ephyre.\r\n\r\n3. Post-Homeric tradition places an Ephyre in Elis.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that Augeias was lord of Elis, that he ruled over\r\nan Hellenic race, that he is an ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν: was this Ephyre the seat\r\nof his empire?\r\n\r\nEven from the bare fact of being in Elis, it stands in significant\r\nconnection with Augeias: but more especially, it seems impossible not\r\nto connect the peculiar knowledge of drugs, preserved at the Ephyre to\r\nwhich Ulysses repaired, with the former fame of Agamede, the daughter\r\nof Augeias (Il. xi. 740), from whom it had, in all probability, been\r\nhanded down to the next following generation.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, what place had Ilus, the son of Mermerus[863], in\r\nan Ephyre, where Augeias had been king or lord? We can give at least\r\nthis negative answer: the Catalogue shews that Elis, in the time of\r\nthe Trojan war, was no longer patriarchally ruled; for the Epeans had\r\nfour coordinate leaders; of whom the grandson of Augeias was but one.\r\nTherefore an Ilus may have been in the time of Ulysses possessed of\r\nthe place, which belonged to Augeias in Nestor’s boyhood: and we may\r\nobserve, that no Epean or Elian chief, contemporary with the _Troica_,\r\nappears in Homer under the title of ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν.\r\n\r\nUpon combining all these circumstances, we appear to have the strongest\r\nwarrant for believing that Augeias was lord of Ephyre; that he was the\r\nhead of one of the ruling families which derived themselves by a known\r\nand recorded lineage from Hellas and a Hellic tribe; and consequently\r\nthat the archaic title of ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν was applied to him, not casually,\r\nbut with a definite meaning, and in conformity to an established rule.\r\n\r\n_Summary of the evidence for Augeias._\r\n\r\nThe following brief synopsis will, after what has been said, serve to\r\nindicate the chief presumptive grounds of the title of Augeias to ἄναξ\r\nἀνδρῶν.\r\n\r\n1. Augeias is connected with the φάρμακα, Il. xi. 739-41.\r\n\r\n2. The φάρμακα with Ephyre, Od. i. 259.\r\n\r\n3. Ephyre with Sisyphus, Il. vi. 152, 3.\r\n\r\n4. Sisyphus is the son of Æolus, Il. vi. 154.\r\n\r\n5. Æolus is Eteo-Hellenic, as the common ancestor of several of the\r\ngreat Greek houses, and the lineal ancestor of at least one ἄναξ\r\nἀνδρῶν[864].\r\n\r\n6. Æolus is also of divine descent, for his descendant Bellerophon is\r\nθεοῦ γόνος, Il. vi. 191.\r\n\r\n7. That is to say, he is a son of Jupiter; for θεὸς commonly means\r\nJupiter, when there is no particular reference to any other deity in\r\nthe context, and when a personal act or attribute is described.\r\n\r\nThe extra-Homeric tradition entirely supports this belief, for it makes\r\nAugeias the son of Salmoneus, and Salmoneus the son of Æolus.\r\n\r\nAnd now, after we have considered so fully the term Ἐφύρη and its\r\nkindred words, we shall do well to notice that at least the dominions\r\nof Agamemnon are not void of some relation to this family of names;\r\ninasmuch as Φᾶρις, in the Catalogue, is one of the towns that provide\r\nhis forces, and Φῆραι, in the Ninth Iliad, is one of the towns of which\r\nhe promises to make Achilles lord. Of Phellias and Sellasia we have\r\nalready treated.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. _Case of Euphetes._\r\n\r\nI proceed to the case of Euphetes.\r\n\r\nHe is mentioned only once in the Homeric Poems. It is when, in the\r\nFifteenth Iliad, Dolops strikes at Meges, son of Phyleus, who is saved\r\nby his stout breastplate: by that breastplate,\r\n\r\n                τόν ποτε Φύλευς\r\n    ἤγαγεν ἐξ Ἐφύρης, ποταμοῦ ἀπὸ Σελλήεντος.\r\n    ξεῖνος γάρ οἱ ἔδωκεν ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν Εὐφήτης[865].\r\n\r\nThis case, as it stands, is very simple. Euphetes is manifestly the\r\nking of Ephyre: the name of the place supplies the connection with the\r\ncradle of the Hellenes; the link is doubled by the name of the river\r\nΣελληείς, and his rank presumably stamps him as of a ruling race in the\r\ncountry; for he is a ξεῖνος to a sovereign, and the xenial relation\r\nappears to have been always one between persons equal, or nearly so.\r\n\r\nThe passage, however, affords us no aid towards determining where this\r\nEphyre lay; for it does not tell us where to look for the residence of\r\nPhyleus.\r\n\r\nWas it the Ephyre of Elis, or was it another Ephyre, mentioned in a\r\npassage that we have not yet examined? To this passage let us now turn.\r\n\r\nIn the Greek Catalogue, Tlepolemus, the son of Hercules, commands nine\r\nships from Rhodes, whither he had migrated, on account of having slain\r\nhis grand uncle Licymnius. His birth is described as follows,--\r\n\r\n    ὃν τέκεν Ἀστυόχεια βίῃ Ἡρακληείῃ·\r\n    τὴν ἄγετ’ ἐξ Ἐφύρης, ποταμοῦ ἀπὸ Σελληέντος,\r\n    πέρσας ἄστεα πολλὰ Διοτρεφέων αἰζηῶν[866].\r\n\r\nHercules then led off Astyocheia from Ephyre beside Selleeis, after\r\nhaving devastated many cities. The opinion may perhaps be sustained\r\nfrom this passage, that the Ephyre mentioned in it is not the Ephyre of\r\nElis, for the following reasons.\r\n\r\n1. Tlepolemus[867] emigrates to Rhodes in consequence of homicide. He\r\nis more likely to have done this from Thessaly than Elis, for we see no\r\nsigns of communication between western Peloponnesus and the islands of\r\nAsia Minor near the base of the Ægean.\r\n\r\n2. If Astyocheia, the mother of Tlepolemus, was also the Astyoche who\r\nbore to Mars Ascalaphus and Ialmenus (Il. ii. 513), then he was more\r\nlikely to be Thessalian than Elian; for Mars, dwelling in Thrace,\r\nbordered upon Thessaly, but is not heard of in Southern Greece; and\r\nthese princes ruled over the Minyeian Orchomenus, which is far from the\r\nPeloponnesus, but near Southern Thessaly.\r\n\r\n3. Again, Nestor, in the Eleventh Book[868], where he sets forth the\r\ndepression into which the Pylians had fallen, through the depredations\r\nof their neighbours the Elians, states that they had been unable\r\nto defend themselves against those ravages, because Hercules had\r\ndevastated their country and slain their princes. Now he would hardly\r\nhave said this, if the Elian Ephyre and its neighbourhood had likewise\r\nbeen devastated by Hercules, since his account would then have failed\r\nto explain the relative inferiority of the Pylians. But if it was\r\nnot the Elian Ephyre, and since the situation of the Isthmus and its\r\nstate make the passage inapplicable to the Corinthian Ephyre, then,\r\nstill looking for some country known in connection with the exploits\r\nof Hercules, we must naturally take it to be the Ephyre of Thessaly,\r\nwhere the name Selleeis, as that of a neighbouring stream, would most\r\nnaturally of all be looked for.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the geographers give us no record of a river Selleeis\r\nnear the Thessalian Ephyre. But the fugitive character of the name\r\nEphyre is manifest from the fact that, though there were several\r\nEphyres in Homer’s time, none of them was of sufficient importance to\r\nfurnish a military contingent worth naming. If by Ephyre was meant\r\nthe first site of a new colony, that name might naturally disappear,\r\nnot only with a removal to a more secure or convenient spot, but\r\neven perhaps on the growth of a mere group of inclosed buildings\r\ninto a walled town. It is therefore no wonder if the site of many of\r\nthese towns has been forgotten, or if the neighbouring streams in\r\nconsequence cannot be identified.\r\n\r\n_The site of his Ephyre._\r\n\r\nThere is a tradition, external to Homer, but not at variance with him,\r\nthat the Astyocheia whom Hercules carried off was the daughter of\r\nPhylas; and if so, Phylas was of course lord of the Ephyre, from which\r\nshe was carried off. If we assume the veracity of this tradition, we\r\ncan determine the seat of the Ephyre of Astyocheia to have been in\r\nThessaly. For the five commanders under Achilles were of course all\r\ndrawn from that country. But among them is Eudorus, the son of Polymele\r\nand grandson of Phylas[869].\r\n\r\nIt may here be asked, by the way, why is not this Eudorus an ἄναξ\r\nἀνδρῶν? even his name is of the form to which the phrase is so well\r\nsuited. The answer is that, though he was the son of Polymele, and the\r\ngrandson of Phylas on the female side, his reputed father was Mercury,\r\nand he was therefore not descended in the male line from, and could not\r\nbe called, the chieftain of a tribe.\r\n\r\nIf then Phylas was lord of the Thessalian Ephyre, and Euphetes was also\r\nlord of the Thessalian Ephyre, in what relation to one another are we\r\nto presume them to have stood as to time? There is here no appearance\r\nof discrepancy. Phyleus, as the father of Meges, was the ξεῖνος of\r\nEuphetes one generation before the Trojan war. Tlepolemus, contemporary\r\nof Meges, was by our supposition the grandson of Phylas. Phylas, lord\r\nof Ephyre, was therefore probably one generation earlier than Euphetes,\r\nand may have been his father.\r\n\r\nNor is it an objection to this reasoning, that Meges, son of Phyleus,\r\nwas lord of Dulichium, and that we cannot suppose Phyleus to have been\r\nthe ξεῖνος of one dwelling so far off as the Thessalian Ephyre. For\r\nfirst, Nestor the Pylian had fought in Thessaly. And next, Meges had\r\nbeen a fugitive from his father’s dwelling on account of a feud with\r\nhim: which makes it even probable that he would remove to a distance,\r\nas we see that Tlepolemus went on a similar account from Thessaly, or\r\nat least from some part of Greece, to Rhodes.\r\n\r\nIf then Euphetes, who was an ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, governed an Ephyre, and\r\nparticularly if it was in Thessaly, the special seat of the Helli, we\r\ncan have little difficulty in concluding that he bore the title as a\r\npatriarchal one, in right of his descent.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Ephyre of Tlepolemus is certainly in the\r\ngeneral opinion presumed to be the Ephyre of Elis. If this opinion be\r\ncorrect, it is still more easy to connect him with the title of ἄναξ\r\nἀνδρῶν. Augeias lives two generations before the Trojan war, rules in\r\nEphyre, and is ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν. Euphetes is contemporary with the father of\r\nMeges, who fights in the war; and he is therefore one generation after\r\nAugeias, while he rules in the same place, and bears the same title. If\r\nthen the Ephyre of Euphetes was Elian, it seems impossible to escape\r\nthe presumption that Euphetes was the son of Augeias.\r\n\r\nThis view as to the Ephyre of Euphetes on the whole will more\r\ncompletely satisfy the Homeric text. For we find Meges in the\r\nThirteenth Book fighting at the head of Epean troops[870]. But the\r\ntroops he led to Troy were from Dulichium and the Echinades[871]. So we\r\ncan only conclude one of two things. Either Meges commanded the Epeans\r\nof Elis in virtue of the connection of his family with that country;\r\nor he commanded Epeans, whom his father Phyleus had taken with him from\r\nElis across the Corinthian gulf. Either way a relation between Elis and\r\nthe family of Meges is made good, which tends to place Euphetes, as the\r\nfriend of that family, in the Ephyre of Elis.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another supposition open. Homer has told us that Phyleus\r\nwas Διὶ φίλος,--a distinction he very rarely confers,--and that he\r\nmigrated, as he implies rather than asserts, from Elis, on account of a\r\nquarrel with his father:\r\n\r\n    ὃς πότε Δουλίχιόν δ’ ἀπενάσσατο πατρὶ χολωθείς.\r\n\r\nHe does not mention the cause; but this abrupt allusion to the father\r\nof Phyleus implies that he was a person of note. Strabo[872] may\r\ntherefore only be filling up a void in Homer, when he tells us, of\r\ncourse from some tradition, that Augeias was the father of Phyleus.\r\n\r\nIf this were so, we have to ask, why is not Phyleus an ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν? and\r\nwho, upon this supposition, could Euphetes be?\r\n\r\nAs we must infer from the Catalogue that the Elian kingdom of Augeias\r\nwas broken up at the epoch of the _Troica_, and as in consequence we do\r\nnot find Polyxeinus, his grandson, called by the title in question, so\r\nneither need we expect it of Phyleus.\r\n\r\nIf Phyleus was the son of Augeias, Euphetes cannot have been sovereign\r\nof the Elian Ephyre, for they would in this case not have been ξεῖνοι,\r\nbut brothers.\r\n\r\nBut he might still have been sovereign either of the Ephyre mentioned\r\nby Homer, μυχῷ Ἄργεος, which appears as Corinth in the Catalogue: or\r\npossibly of the Thesprotian Ephyre with which we become acquainted in\r\nStrabo.\r\n\r\nIf Euphetes represented, with the title of ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, one of the old\r\nHellic chieftaincies at either of those places, nothing could be more\r\nnatural than that the tie of hostship should subsist between him and\r\nPhyleus, the son of another Hellic chieftain of the same class.\r\n\r\nIn any case, though the Homeric evidence is palpably incomplete, yet\r\nby connecting the title of ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν with the highly characteristic\r\nlocal title of Ephyre, and the name of the river Selleeis, it\r\nunequivocally supports the interpretation of that title as one\r\nindicating an original and purely Hellic chieftaincy.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. _Case of Eumelus._\r\n\r\nIt now only remains to consider the case of Eumelus, the last of the\r\nsix persons to whom Homer gives the peculiar title of ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν.\r\n\r\nHe is introduced to us in the Catalogue as the φίλος παῖς[873] (φίλος\r\nmeaning probably either the eldest or only son) of Admetus, who is\r\nnever mentioned except in the oblique cases, and to whom therefore,\r\nconsistently with his usage, Homer never applies the title ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν.\r\nHe is in command of his father’s forces; and, as Pheræ is the city\r\nfirst named in this list, we may infer that this was his principal city.\r\n\r\nIn the first place I would remark, that we have for this Pheræ a sign\r\nof wealth, which has been already noticed, the excellence, namely, of\r\nits breed of horses. There is also abundant evidence of the wealth and\r\nimportance of Pheræ in the historic times[874]. This mark then accords\r\nwith the hypothesis, that it was probably one of the primitive lowland\r\nsettlements made by the Hellic race in Thessaly. In fact, Pheræ stands\r\nrelatively to Admetus, as Ephyre does relatively to Augeias, Euphetes,\r\nand the older Æolid, Sisyphus.\r\n\r\nThrough the medium of the name Pheræ we connect this family with Ἐφύρη,\r\nas its cognate name, and as the name which we have found, in the cases\r\nof Euphetes and Augeias, to be eminently characteristic of settlements\r\nunder an ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν.\r\n\r\nNext it appears, that the father or ancestor of Admetus took his name\r\nfrom the place which he inhabited, and was called Pheres, for says the\r\npoet,\r\n\r\n    Ἵπποι μὲν μέγ’ ἄρισται ἔσαν Φηρητιάδαο,\r\n    τὰς Εὔμηλος ἔλαυνε[875].\r\n\r\nThe union between the names of the place and the person affords another\r\nsign of primitive settlement. Pheres was probably the founder of the\r\ntown Φηραί.\r\n\r\nNext, a passage in the Odyssey gives us an account of this Pheres[876].\r\nHe was the son of Cretheus, by Tyro:\r\n\r\n    τοὺς δ’ ἑτέρους Κρηθῆϊ τέκεν βασίλεια γυναικῶν,\r\n    Αἴσονά τ’ ἠδὲ Φέρητ’ Ἀμυθάονα τ’ ἱππιοχάρμην.\r\n\r\nNow Cretheus was a son or descendant of Æolus:\r\n\r\n    Φῆ δὲ Κρηθῆος γυνὴ ἔμμεναι Αἰολίδαο[877].\r\n\r\nAnd we have already seen the Æolids of Homer directly connected with\r\nthe characteristic name of Ephyre in the person of Sisyphus (Il. vi.\r\n152, 211). Outside the Homeric text, all tradition ascribes to the\r\nÆolians, not less than the Achæans, an Eteo-Hellenic origin. Again, we\r\nmay observe, that among the Greek genealogies of Homer, the longest are\r\nthose of the Æolids. From Æolus to Glaucus II, in the Sixth Iliad, are\r\nsix generations: and here in like manner from Cretheus to Eumelus are\r\nfour, which number will be increased to five or to six, according as\r\nwe take Cretheus to be the son or the grandson of Æolus, or estimate\r\nthe age of Eumelus. According to the Homeric force of the patronymic,\r\nhe may be either. Eumelus, however, himself was, as we have seen,\r\npresumably not young at the time of the _Troica_; since he was wedded\r\nto Iphthime, the sister of Penelope, who must be taken to stand, with\r\nher husband Ulysses (Il. xxiii. 791), as above the average age of the\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nTo sum up; it thus far appears,\r\n\r\n1. That Eumelus was heir to Admetus, a reigning prince of Thessaly or\r\nHellas.\r\n\r\n2. That the capital of this prince bore testimony by its name to its\r\nprimitive or Eteo-Hellenic character.\r\n\r\n3. That Eumelus was a descendant in the male line from Æolus, of\r\nwhose lineage several, according to Homer, seem to have possessed the\r\ncharacter and borne the title of the ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν.\r\n\r\n4. In virtue of his descent from Æolus, he is sprung from Jupiter.\r\n\r\nTo estimate fully the force of the evidence, it may be well to observe,\r\nthat a great many Thessalian princes and leaders are noticed in the\r\nCatalogue besides Eumelus; to the last alone, however, the title of\r\nἄναξ ἀνδρῶν is applied. But no one of the others bears any mark,\r\npersonal or local, of the peculiar descent and social position to which\r\nthis title appears to belong: although among them are found Podaleirius\r\nand Machaon, the sons of Asclepius; Polypœtes, the son of Pirithous,\r\nand grandson of Jupiter; Eurypylus, the distinguished warrior;\r\nProtesilaus and Philoctetes, each the subject of distinct historical\r\nnotices.\r\n\r\nAgain, I would, from the case of Eumelus, illustrate the phrase ἄναξ\r\nἀνδρῶν in another point of view.\r\n\r\nHe was descended by his mother Alcestis from Neptune. She was the\r\ndaughter of Pelias, the son whom Tyro bore to the fabled ruler of the\r\nseas. This descent on the mother’s side is mentioned in the Catalogue,\r\nwhere a total silence is observed as to his paternal lineage from Æolus\r\nand Cretheus.\r\n\r\n    Εὔμηλος, τὸν ὑπ’ Ἀδμήτῳ τέκε δῖα γυναικῶν,\r\n    Ἄλκηστις, Πελίαο θυγατρῶν εἶδος ἀρίστη.\r\n\r\nBut it is plain that his descent from Jupiter by the father’s side was\r\nmore worthy of notice than his descent from Neptune through the bastard\r\nPelias. Yet Homer has nowhere taken notice of the descent from Jupiter,\r\nin the case of Eumelus, unless it is implied in the meaning of the term\r\nἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, though we know the descent as a fact: surely a strong\r\nproof that it is part of the meaning of the phrase ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, and is\r\na thing not only inseparable from it, but conveyed by it.\r\n\r\n_The ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν descended from Jupiter._\r\n\r\nWith regard to the divine descent of the Homeric chieftains bearing\r\nthis title, our direct evidence from the Poet stands as follows:\r\n\r\n1. That the Dardan line springs originally from Jupiter.\r\n\r\n2. That Tyro, being called εὐπατέρεια in common with Helen only, is\r\nevidently meant to be described as sprung from that deity.\r\n\r\n3. That Bellerophon, also an Æolid, is also θεοῦ γόνος, therefore\r\nhimself a descendant of Jupiter.\r\n\r\n4. And if so, then Eumelus, who was Æolid too, falls within the same\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n5. Augeias in like manner attains to the same honour by the Homeric\r\npresumptions which make him an Æolid, as well as by all extra-Homeric\r\ntradition.\r\n\r\n6. With regard to Euphetes and Agamemnon, we have no direct evidence.\r\nBut we have seen strong reason to suppose, that Euphetes was himself an\r\nÆolid: and no inconsiderable presumption that Tantalus was according to\r\nHomer what the later tradition makes him, a son of Jupiter, and that\r\nAgamemnon was descended from Tantalus.\r\n\r\nPerhaps also, without venturing to attach any conclusive weight to\r\nsuch a sign, we may interpret the annexation of Διοτρεφὴς and Διογενὴς\r\nto Hellic kingship, as a sign that the earliest Hellic kingship,\r\nbeing also that which conveyed the title of ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, was always\r\nassociated with divine descent.\r\n\r\nAmong those who bear the title of ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, we find no case of a\r\ndescent from Jupiter reputed to be recent. The two lines in which the\r\ntitle is most clearly transmitted, those of Æolus and of Dardanus, are\r\namong the oldest genealogies in Homer. That of Agamemnon, apparently\r\nthe shortest, interposes at the least four generations between Jupiter\r\nand him.\r\n\r\nThe line of Dardanus is apparently by one generation longer than any\r\nof the others belonging to an ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν. But nothing can be more\r\nnatural: for any settlement, made by the Helli on the Hellespont during\r\ntheir eastward movement, would naturally precede by some time their\r\ndescent from Olympus and the Thracian hills into Thessaly; so that the\r\nearlier date of the primary ancestor is a witness for, rather than\r\nagainst the relationship.\r\n\r\nIt cannot, however, be too carefully borne in mind, that the divine\r\ndescent of the ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν from Jupiter is widely different from that\r\nof the more recent heroes, like Sarpedon or Hercules. We may suppose\r\nthat in such cases as these the divine parent either screens the\r\nresult of unlawful love, or perhaps indicates the sudden rise into\r\neminence of a family previously obscure: with the ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν the case\r\nis quite distinct. The poetical meaning here is, that backward there\r\nlay nothing of family history beyond the ancestor from whom he claimed\r\ndescent, whether it were Dardanus, or Æolus, or Tantalus: as if aiming\r\nat the effect legitimately produced by those words in the Gospel of\r\nSt. Luke, with which the upward line of the genealogy given by him\r\ncloses; ‘which was the son of Adam, which was the son of God[878].’\r\nAnd the historic basis of the allegory may probably be this, that the\r\nperson indicated was one of some ruling house, who, with his followers\r\nor kindred, separated from the migratory race of Helli as it swept\r\nwestward along the hills, and founded a stable settlement, and a\r\nsociety more or less organized in orders and employments, in which his\r\nname became the symbol at once of sovereign rank, of the national point\r\nof origin, and of affinity in blood with a ruling race.\r\n\r\n_Four notes of the ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν._\r\n\r\nTo conclude then: the notes of the ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν in Homer, probable or\r\ndemonstrative, are these:\r\n\r\n1. He must be born of Jupiter _ab antiquo_.\r\n\r\n2. He must hold a sovereignty, either paramount or secondary, and\r\neither in whole, or, like Æneas, by devolution in part, over some given\r\nplace or tribe.\r\n\r\n3. His family must have held this sovereignty continuously from the\r\ntime of the primary ancestor.\r\n\r\n4. He must be the head of a ruling tribe or house of the original\r\nHellenic stock: and must be connected with marks of the presence of\r\nHellenic settlement. These marks may, as in the case of Agamemnon, be\r\nsupplied by a race or tribe: or they may be territorial, such as those\r\nafforded by the name of the river Selleeis, and more especially by the\r\nname Ephyre, and the family of cognate words.\r\n\r\nNow each of the six persons, to whom alone Homer gives the title ἄναξ\r\nἀνδρῶν, partakes, by evidence either demonstrative or probable, of\r\nevery one of these notes.\r\n\r\n_Negative proofs._\r\n\r\nAmong negative evidences that the title ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν conveys a peculiar\r\nsense, we may place the following:\r\n\r\n1. The position of Priam in Troas, where he was the greatest man of\r\nNorth-western Asia, Il. xxiv. 543-6, and of Hector, or else Paris, as\r\nhis heir, were such as called for the highest epithets of dignity. He\r\nhad even a regular court of γέροντες, of whom it seems plain, that some\r\nat least, such as Antenor, were invested with some kind of sovereignty.\r\nYet none of the Ilian family are called by the name of ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν.\r\n\r\n2. Alcinous in the Odyssey affords another example of a lord over\r\nlords, who does not belong to the historical Greek stem, and who\r\ntherefore is not called ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν. The example may appear weak,\r\nbecause of the divine descent of the Phæacians. But if this phrase\r\nhad, like κρείων, been one of merely general ornament, why should it\r\nnot have been applied to him as κρείων is, or to his brother Rhexenor,\r\nor his father Nausithous? If the divine descent of the Phæacians from\r\nNeptune renders the phrase inapplicable to them, this is of itself a\r\nproof of its very specific nature.\r\n\r\n3. Again; it may be asked why Glaucus was not an ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, as he\r\nwas descended from an Æolid sovereign. The answer is, he was no longer\r\nthe chieftain of any Hellenic clan. His grandfather Bellerophon had\r\nmigrated simply as an individual fugitive into a South-Asian country,\r\nof which the people had no immediate ties of race with him; and, while\r\napart from his original tribe, he could not inherit a title as its head.\r\n\r\n4. Sarpedon was under the same disqualification as Glaucus his brother\r\nking. Besides this, he was not descended in the male line from Æolus,\r\nbut only through his mother Hippodamia.\r\n\r\n5. Again, among the Greeks. Why, it may be asked, was not Peleus, or\r\nwhy was not Achilles an ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν? Here was a throne above thrones:\r\nfor Patroclus was not only an ἄναξ, but was called Διογενὴς, which\r\nimplies sovereignty; therefore Menœtius his father was the same: but\r\nMenœtius was in attendance at the court of Peleus. Phœnix again was\r\ntutor to that chief, though he ruled over the Dolopians by the gift of\r\nPeleus, as he tells us,\r\n\r\n    καί μ’ ἀφνειὸν ἔθηκε, πολὺν δέ μοι ὤπασε λαὸν,\r\n    ναῖον δ’ ἐσχατίην Φθίης, Δολόπεσσιν ἀνάσσων[879].\r\n\r\nBesides that he occupied a great position, and was of the highest\r\ndescent, I think it is clear from the Catalogue that the Myrmidons,\r\nover whom Peleus reigned, were Achæans, and therefore a strictly Hellic\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nAnd again, the character of Achilles makes it quite clear that his\r\nfamily were from the Hellic stock. For it is in him that Homer has\r\nchosen to exhibit the prime and foremost pattern of the whole Greek\r\nnation: and he could surely never have chosen for such a purpose any\r\nfamily of foreign, or of doubtful blood.\r\n\r\nIt is not however in every Hellic race or family, but only among the\r\nknown representatives by descent of the principal or senior branches,\r\nthat we are justified in expecting to find the patriarchal title. And\r\nstill less do we know whether the Myrmidons, even though Hellic and\r\nAchæan, were a principal tribe of that stock.\r\n\r\nThe evidence as to the descent of Achilles may throw further light upon\r\nthis part of the subject.\r\n\r\nIn those cases where a long line of ancestry purported to begin with\r\nJupiter, as, for instance, the Trojan genealogy, it is doubtless\r\nnatural to treat this as a sort of necessary introduction to a period,\r\nbeyond which the memory of man, unaided as it was, did not run.\r\n\r\nBut when we find the paternity of a person contemporary with the Trojan\r\nwar, or of some near ancestor of his, referred to Jupiter, the most\r\nproper interpretation of this legendary statement seems to be, that\r\nthey were, so to speak, _novi homines_, who having come suddenly into\r\nthe blaze of celebrity, and living among a nation accustomed to ask\r\nof every passing stranger who were his parents, yet having no parents\r\nto quote, or none worth quoting, gilded their origin by claiming some\r\ngreat deity for their father. I do not speak now of the distinct\r\nand yet cognate case, where a similar pretext was used to shield\r\nillegitimacy: as for example, not to travel from the line before us, in\r\nthe instance of the son of Polydora[880], sister to Achilles himself.\r\nBut the same principle applies to both: divine progenitorship was used\r\nto keep from view something that it was desirable to hide, whether this\r\nwere the shame of a noble maiden, or the undistinguished ancestry of a\r\ngreat house or hero. Such a hero perhaps, according to this rule, was\r\nHercules: such a house more clearly was that of the Æacids; for Æacus,\r\ngrandfather of Achilles, was son of Jupiter[881]. He did not therefore\r\nrepresent a patriarchal family, and could not bear the title.\r\n\r\nAccording to extra-Homeric tradition, the Myrmidons fled from Ægina to\r\nThessaly under Peleus[882].\r\n\r\n6. Further examples may be taken from the Pelopid family. The Menelaus\r\nof the Iliad belongs to the highest order: he is more kingly than the\r\nother kings[883]. In the Odyssey he desires to transplant Ulysses to a\r\nportion of his dominions (Od. iv. 174). And Ægisthus actually occupies\r\nfor years, during the exile of Orestes, the Pelopid throne: the name of\r\neither Menelaus or Ægisthus is of the metrical value most convenient\r\nfor union with the ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν: but neither the one nor the other was\r\nthe representative of the great Achæan house of Pelops, and accordingly\r\nneither the one nor the other receives the title.\r\n\r\n7. Diomed is a Greek of the very highest descent: of him alone, among\r\nthe kings before Troy, we may confidently say, that he was himself a\r\nhero, had a hero for his father, a hero for his uncle, and a hero for\r\nhis grandfather. Œneus, Tydeus, Meleager, are three names not easily\r\nto be matched in early Greek story. They were likewise near the stock,\r\nas we may probably infer from the name of the founder of the race,\r\nPortheus, the Destroyer. He was father of Œneus and also of Ἄγριος the\r\nRude, and Μέλας the Swarthy, all names indicating that the first stage\r\nof arrival within the precinct of civilization had not yet been passed.\r\nHe commanded, too, one of the largest contingents: yet neither he nor\r\nhis uncle Meleager, the Achilles of his day, is ever called ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν.\r\n\r\nThe reason doubtless is that, in the case of the Œneid family, there is\r\nno connection with a leading Greek ancestry. They are neither Æolid nor\r\nPelopid; and they stand in no relation to the characteristic names of\r\nEphyre and the Selleeis.\r\n\r\n8. Let me notice, lastly, the case of Nestor. He had been a warrior\r\nof the first class. His rich dominions supplied a contingent of ninety\r\nships to the war; larger even than that of Diomed, or of any chief\r\nwhatever, except Agamemnon, who had one hundred. His father, Neleus,\r\nwas of great fame. He had actually more influence in council than any\r\nother chief, and always took the lead there. He was descended from\r\nNeptune, who indeed was but his grandfather: while his grandmother,\r\nTyro, was probably, as we have found, a granddaughter of Æolus.\r\n\r\nBut he could not be ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, because not in lineal male descent\r\nfrom the primary ancestor Æolus: nor was he the tribal head of the\r\nHellenic race among which he ruled, which was an Achæan one (Il. xi.\r\n759), since the Achæans owned the Pelopids for their chiefs. Also his\r\nfather Neleus, apparently the younger twin, had migrated from the\r\nNorth, leaving Pelias the elder, as is probable, in possession. Thus\r\nNestor presents none of the four notes of the ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν. Yet this\r\ntitle attached to an insignificant relative, Eumelus, his first cousin\r\nonce removed, doubtless because he possessed them.\r\n\r\n_Persons with the notes yet without the title._\r\n\r\nIt is certainly true that there are a few cases where Homer has _not_\r\napplied the title of ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν to particular persons, to whom he\r\nmight have given it consistently with the suppositions, as to its\r\nmeaning, of which I have attempted to show the truth. They are, in one\r\nword, the ancestors of the persons to whom he has actually given the\r\ntitle. But all of these, such as Pelops and his line, Dardanus with his\r\nline as far as Tros, and the earlier descendants of Æolus, are persons\r\nmentioned in the poems for the most part but once, and rarely more than\r\ntwice or thrice. Now, as Homer mentions frequently without the prefix,\r\nἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, those to whom on other occasions he gives it, we are not\r\nentitled to require its application to all persons capable of bearing\r\nit, whom he mentions but once.\r\n\r\nAnd again, if I am right in holding that this was strictly a title\r\nattaching to lineage, then it was wholly needless, when he had\r\ndesignated a particular person, as an ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, to grace his\r\npredecessors also with the title, because, as a matter of course,\r\ninasmuch as they were his predecessors, it attached to them. No\r\nhistoric aim then was involved, and no purpose would have been gained\r\nif Admetus, for example, had been mentioned with this title as well as\r\nhis son Eumelus.\r\n\r\nBut, I confess, it appears to me to afford no small confirmation to the\r\narguments and the conclusions of these pages, when we remember that\r\nnot only do the four rules for the sense of the phrase suit, as far as\r\nwe can tell, all the six persons to whom it is applied, but that there\r\nis absolutely no other living person named in the poems, whom they\r\nwould not effectually exclude, with the insignificant exceptions, first\r\nof Admetus, who has just been mentioned, and next of Orestes. In the\r\nIliad, Orestes is only named in one single passage (twice repeated), of\r\nthe Ninth Book[884]. In the Odyssey he is named several times, but the\r\ntitle of ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν is less suitable to the political state of Greece\r\nas it appears in this poem, and also to the subject. It never appears,\r\nexcept retrospectively.\r\n\r\nA few words may perhaps be due to the case of Polyxeinus, grandson of\r\nAugeias, who, it is just possible, though unlikely, may have retained\r\nthe position of his grandfather. It is just possible, because we are\r\nnot assured of the contrary; but most unlikely, because Augeias appears\r\nas lord of the Epeans, Polyxeinus only as commanding a division of\r\nthem. Again, Polyxeinus is only once mentioned. It is also evident that\r\nthe loss of his grandfather’s throne, by a revolution in Elis, might\r\nnaturally put an end to the application of the title in his particular\r\ncase, by a process exactly the same with that to which its general and\r\nfinal extinction, now so speedily to arrive, was due.\r\n\r\nIt might indeed be of some interest to inquire why it is that, when\r\nHomer makes no practical or effective use of the phrase for any one\r\nexcept Agamemnon, he has notwithstanding been careful to register,\r\nas it were, a title to it on behalf of five other persons? Nor can I\r\ndoubt that the just answer would be, that he did this because, with his\r\nhistoric aims, he may have deemed it a matter of national interest to\r\nrecord a title of such peculiar and primitive significance.\r\n\r\n_Its disappearance with Homer._\r\n\r\nBut of all the negative arguments that tend to show ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν not to\r\nhave been a merely vague title, there is none on which I dwell with\r\nmore confidence than its total disappearance with the Homeric age.\r\nFor it was not so with the other less peculiar forms, βασιλεὺς, ἄναξ,\r\nand κρείων. Although they were supplanted in actual use by the term\r\nτυραννὸς, which became for the Greeks the type of supreme power in\r\nthe hands of a single person, yet the idea of them was traditionally\r\nretained. Accordingly, even the name βασιλεὺς was applied by Greek\r\nwriters to contemporary kings out of Greece, and to the old bygone\r\nGreek monarchies: and Thucydides has given it to them as a class, where\r\nhe describes the πατρικαὶ βασιλεῖαι[885]. But the phrase ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν,\r\nthe most specific of them all, disappears even from retrospective\r\nuse: and the inference is, that its proper meaning had ceased to be\r\nrepresented in the institutions either of Greece or of the known world\r\nbeyond the Greek borders; that it had passed away with the archaic\r\nsystem, of which it was the peculiar token.\r\n\r\nEven independently of direct testimony, we might be assured that\r\nthe patriarchal and highland constitution of society could not very\r\nlong survive the multiplication of settlements in the plains. For\r\nthe wealth, which these settlements created through the increased\r\nefficiency of labour, the greater bounty of the earth, and the\r\naugmented means of communication and exchange, could not but bring with\r\nit at once new temptations, and new sources of disturbance; whereas the\r\nart of controlling these evils was but painfully and slowly, and most\r\nincompletely learned. Among highland tribes, there might be war and\r\npillage with a view to immediate wants: but stored wealth could not be\r\nstolen, where, except in its simplest forms, it did not exist: and men\r\ndo not overturn hereditary power, or drag society into revolutions,\r\nwithout an object.\r\n\r\nBut the Catalogue, as well as other parts of the Homeric poems, show\r\nus how the causes thus indicated had already worked. Of the Greek\r\nStates comprised in that invaluable enumeration, some were, as is\r\nplainly asserted or implied, monarchically governed: for example, the\r\nMycenians, the Spartans, the Pylians, the Myrmidons, the Arcadians,\r\nthe Eubœans[886], and the Ætolians. We may reasonably infer the same\r\nwith regard to the followers of those great chiefs, who are treated as\r\nΒασιλεῖς in the body of the poems: the Salaminians and Locrians, each\r\nunder their Ajax, the Cephallenians under Ulysses, the Cretans, or else\r\na portion of them, under Idomeneus, the Argives under Diomed. In each\r\nof these cases, either there is but a single leader, or, as in the two\r\nlast, the text makes it obvious that the chief first named is supreme\r\nin rank. We may probably infer that monarchy prevailed in all the\r\ninstances, including the Athenians, when only a single general appears.\r\nThe expression δῆμος, applied to Athens, is perfectly compatible with\r\nkingship in Homer. But there remain six cases, where there are a\r\nplurality of leaders, apparently on an equal footing. These are the\r\ncases of\r\n\r\n1. The Bœotians.\r\n\r\n2. The people of Aspledon and the Minyeian Orchomenus; who are in fact\r\na second Bœotian contingent.\r\n\r\n3. The Phocians.\r\n\r\n4. The Elians or Epeans: who differ from the others in being formally\r\ndistributed into four divisions, under four leaders, and who are\r\ntherefore strictly acephalous.\r\n\r\n5. The Nisurians, &c.\r\n\r\n6. The people of Tricce, Ithome, and Œchalia, under the sons of\r\nAsclepius.\r\n\r\nIt is observable with respect to the four first of these, that\r\nthey were all in the comparatively open, and rich country; liable,\r\ntherefore, to the influences which, as Thucydides observes[887],\r\nmade Bœotia, Thessaly, and most of Peloponnesus peculiarly liable to\r\nrevolutions; and whence doubtless it is, that Homer has been led to\r\ntell us that Amphion and Zethus built walls for Thebes, because they\r\ncould not hold it without them.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Nisurians, in stating that they were under\r\nPheidippus and Antiphus, Homer adds that these were (Il. ii. 679)\r\n\r\n    Θεσσαλοῦ υἷε δύω Ἡρακλείδαο ἄνακτος.\r\n\r\nOn which we may observe\r\n\r\n1. That the power divided between them had apparently been monarchical\r\nin the preceding generation.\r\n\r\n2. That the name of their father points to his having been born\r\nin Thessaly[888], which from its richness was peculiarly open to\r\nrevolutions.\r\n\r\n3. That he was the son of Hercules, with whose name disturbance and\r\nconvulsion are so much associated.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the sons of Asclepius, there is the same presumption\r\nthat they divided a power which had been monarchical: and although the\r\nepithet κλωμακόεσσα given to Ithome, the site of which is unknown[889],\r\nmay suggest rough and broken ground, yet the territory is within the\r\nlimits of Thessaly[890], and on the river Peneus. Tricce was known\r\nin the historic times; and it is mentioned in Homer with the epithet\r\nἱππόβοτος, indicating fertility.\r\n\r\n_Signs of political disorganisation._\r\n\r\nHere, then, and particularly in the Bœotian and Elian cases, we have\r\nconsiderable signs of the weakening and gradual breaking up of the\r\nold highland institutions: I distinguish between those two and the\r\nrest, because where the division is only between two brothers, it may\r\nhave implied little deviation from the monarchical form. Still that\r\nlittle might be the first stage of a deviation which was soon to grow\r\nindefinitely large.\r\n\r\nThere are other signs to the same effect, both in the Iliad, and to a\r\ngreater extent in the Odyssey.\r\n\r\nFor example: the dynasty of the Œneids had disappeared among the\r\nÆtolians[891]: the dynasty of the Æolids, and the name Ephyre, from\r\nCorinth[892]: Polyxeinus, the grandson of Augeias, an ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, is\r\nnot described as an ἄναξ, or lord, at all: Hercules had laid waste the\r\ncities about Ephyre, and the cities about Pylos[893]: Tlepolemus, at\r\nwar with his Heraclid relations, had been driven to emigrate to Rhodes:\r\nand all this since the family of the Perseids had disappeared before\r\nthe Pelopids.\r\n\r\nThe changes observable in the Odyssey are such as connect themselves\r\nwith a species of deluge, which had apparently overspread the face of\r\nthe political society of Greece. They would merit a full examination,\r\nin connection with a view of the relation of that poem to the Iliad.\r\nHere it need only be observed, that the ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν appears nowhere\r\nin the action of the Odyssey: the phrase is used but twice, and then\r\nonly with reference to the dead Agamemnon: and that the partial\r\ndisappearance of the word from the later work of Homer evidently\r\naccompanies a great approach towards disorganisation of the old order\r\nof things and ideas in the political state of Greece.\r\n\r\n_Summary of the whole._\r\n\r\nI may now collect the results, as far as they are related to the\r\npresent subject, of our whole ethnological inquiry.\r\n\r\n1. From the Homeric text, the phrase ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν appears not to have\r\nbelonged to political preeminence or power, or to personal heroism,\r\nor to the distinction of wealth, or to divine descent as such; but to\r\nthe archaic form of sovereignty which united it continuously with the\r\nheadship in blood of a ruling family or clan, inhabiting the country\r\nwhich was the reputed cradle of the nation, or able to trace lineally\r\nits derivation from that country. A tradition of original descent from\r\nJupiter attached in all cases essentially to the possession of the\r\ntitle.\r\n\r\n2. In each of the six instances where Homer employs it, he appears to\r\ndo so in strict conformity with the rules thus indicated.\r\n\r\n3. The immediate cradle of those Greek races, which possessed this\r\nprimitive title and descent, was Thessaly; and of Thessaly Hellas was\r\neither a synonym, or a part.\r\n\r\n4. The origin of the races thus ruling Hellas is to be sought among the\r\nHelli, who dwelt in the mountains around Dodona, apparently with those\r\ninstitutions which have ever been characteristic of mountaineers; and\r\nwho represent, more faithfully than the inhabitants of lowlands, the\r\nearliest type of human society, cast at a time when its relationship to\r\nthe family was still palpable and near.\r\n\r\n5. The resemblances of the Helli and the Dardans afford, together with\r\nthe probabilities of the case, strong evidence of their having some\r\ncommon affinity to the same branch of the great stem, from which a\r\nlarge part of Europe was peopled with its ruling race.\r\n\r\n6. Finally, we may with reasonable grounds conjecture, that the\r\npatriarchal system denoted by the patriarchal chieftaincies, which had\r\nbeen shaken before the Trojan war, was further and violently disturbed\r\nby it, and by its direct and indirect political consequences; and that\r\nthis system had vanished before the line of the post-Homeric Greek\r\npoets, to be reckoned from Hesiod, had begun. Thus, the basis of the\r\ntitle being removed, the title itself naturally disappeared from\r\nliterature as well as history; and if we find, that in later times\r\nthe key to its meaning had been lost, it is but a new mark of the\r\nabruptness and width of the breach that lies between Homer and his\r\nsuccessors, of the paucity of continuous traditions, and of the limited\r\nmeans possessed by the Greeks of the historic ages for research into\r\nthe earlier periods of their national existence.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[764] Od. iv. 697.\r\n\r\n[765] This caution is not needless, as the error is a common one.\r\nDamm, indeed, most strangely says, ἄναξ _ex multo augustius nomen\r\nquam_ βασιλεὺς (in voc. ἄναξ). The English translators, Chapman, Pope,\r\nCowper, and others, render ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, king of men.

X.\r\n\r\n_On the connection of the Hellenes and Achæans with the East._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have reached the close of this inquiry, so far as it regards the\r\norigin, character, and pursuits of the Pelasgians; the character of\r\nthe Hellenic tribes, and their relations to the Pelasgians; and the\r\nposition of the Achæans among the Hellenes, as the first national\r\nrepresentatives of the Hellenic stock. But who were these Achæans, and\r\nwhence did they come? We have at present been able only to describe\r\nthem by negatives. They were not the descendants of a legendary Achæus:\r\nthey did not take their name from a Greek territory, nor from any\r\npursuit that they followed; and the word has no apparent root in the\r\netymology of the Greek tongue.\r\n\r\nBut we have seen manifest indications that the Hellic name did not\r\nfirst come into being on the western side of the Dardanelles: and if\r\nthe Achæi were the first leaders of the Helli, why should we not trace\r\nthem too beyond the Straits, and thus follow perhaps the Helli also, by\r\ntheir means, and as represented in them, up to a fountain-head?\r\n\r\nAt the same time, if I presume to affiliate the Hellic nation upon any\r\nEastern parentage, and, again, to suggest relationships between that\r\nnation and others, which had also migrated from the first nurseries\r\nof man towards the West, it will, I hope, be understood, that all\r\nsuch propositions are asserted, not only as not demonstrable, but as\r\nlikewise being, even within their own limits, those of merely probable\r\ntruth, subject, by an admission tacitly carried all along, to every\r\nkind of qualification. The succession and intermixture of races, the\r\ncombinations of language, the sympathetic and imitative communication\r\nof ideas and institutions, form a mass of phenomena complex enough, and\r\ndifficult to describe, even by contemporaries; how much more so by the\r\naid only of those faint and scattered rays that we can now find cast\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\nLet us then proceed to consider what aid can be had from other sources\r\nin support of those presumptions, arising out of the text of Homer,\r\nwhich tend to connect the Hellenes of his day, and the Achæans as their\r\nleading tribe, with the East.\r\n\r\nAnd here we may look first, as far as regards the general outlines of\r\nrace and language, to the ethnological evidences afforded by the course\r\nof migration from Central Asia over Europe.\r\n\r\nNext, to the evidence of those among ancient authors, who have taken\r\nnotice of this diffusion in such a manner as in any degree to guide us\r\ntowards the sources of the great factors of the Greek nation.\r\n\r\nAfter that, we will inquire whether the names themselves, which are\r\nemployed in Homer for the contemporary Greeks, can, by comparison with\r\ncognate names elsewhere, afford us any light.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, whether in the quarter to which these lines of information\r\nwould lead us, we can discover any of those resemblances of manners\r\nand character with the Greeks which, if found, would afford the most\r\nsatisfactory corroboration to the argument in favour of the derivation\r\nof one from the other.\r\n\r\nThe labours of ethnologists have associated together in one great\r\nfamily, at first called Indo-Germanic, and then Indo-European, but\r\nthreatening to expand even beyond the scope of that comprehensive name,\r\na mass of leading languages from the Celtic regions in the west to the\r\nplains of India in the east.\r\n\r\n_High German and Low German races._\r\n\r\nThis great family, says Dr. Donaldson[894], divides itself into two\r\ngroups. To these two groups respectively belong the Low German and the\r\nHigh German tongues: the former spoken in the plain countries to the\r\nnorth of Europe, the latter in the more mountainous countries to the\r\nsouth. The Low German languages contain evidence of greater antiquity,\r\nand those who speak them appear to have been driven onward in their\r\nmigrations by the High Germans following them: the latter entering\r\nEurope by Asia Minor, the former to the north of the Euxine.\r\n\r\nThe distinction runs back to the earlier seat of the race in Ariana or\r\nIran, a portion of Asia which may be loosely defined as lying between\r\nthe Caspian and the Indian ocean to the north and south, the Indus\r\nand the Euphrates to the east and west. Within these limits are to be\r\nfound two forms of language, holding the same relation to one another\r\nas that which subsists between the High German and Low German tongues;\r\nthe first, corresponding with the High German, was spoken among the\r\ncountries of the south-west, where lies Persia proper, and the other in\r\nits more northern and eastern portions, of which Media formed a central\r\npart. The population of this great tract issued forth in the direction\r\nof the south-east, over the northern parts of India; and again towards\r\nAsia Minor and Europe, in the direction of the north-west. Those who\r\ncame first proceeded from Media, and supplied the base of what have\r\nbeen called, the Low German nations: Sarmatians, Saxons, Getæ (or\r\nScythians or Goths). The language of these emigrants was that which,\r\nwhen it assumed an organized or classical form, and with due allowance\r\nfor changes which the lapse of time must have introduced, became the\r\ntongue now best represented, at least as a literary language, by the\r\nSanscrit.\r\n\r\nThe whole course of history seems to indicate a struggle of races in\r\nthat quarter of the world, which may be used to illustrate the present\r\ninquiry. To a certain extent the scene of that struggle may be pointed\r\nout on the map. From the Caspian towards the south, and from the\r\nhead of the Persian Gulf towards the north, the land soon rises to a\r\ngreat general elevation, but with marked and also highly diversified\r\ninequalities. Media would appear to have occupied the principal part of\r\nthe great central space, defined by the mountains which form the outer\r\nline of this elevation. It corresponds with what is now the Province\r\nof Irak, and Ispahan is its principal city. Here, says Malcolm[895],\r\nwe find the happiest climate that Persia can boast. To the south,\r\nnear the Gulf, the summer heat is overpowering: as the country rises\r\ntowards Shiraz the climate becomes temperate, and further improves as\r\nwe advance northward, until we approach the hills that divide Irak from\r\nMazenderan on the Caspian, where it deteriorates.\r\n\r\n_The Province of Fars or Persia proper._\r\n\r\nImmediately to the south of Irak, and touching the Persian gulf, a\r\nlittle to the east of the Karoon and Jerokh, which are the eastern\r\ntributaries of the great central rivers, Tigris and Euphrates, is\r\nthe Province of Fars, which ascends the hills to its capital town\r\nShiraz, and then extends in a north-easterly direction towards the\r\nsandy deserts. This is the province[896] where the Persian race is\r\nstill to be found in its greatest purity; and from this tract the name\r\nof Persia, attached by Europeans to the empire of Iran, is supposed\r\nto be derived[897]. From Fars or Pars, for both forms are understood\r\nto exist, is drawn the name Parsee, borne by the fire-worshippers,\r\nwho migrated for safety into India: and the same root appears to be\r\nclearly traceable in the great Persian tribe of Pasargadæ, named by\r\nHerodotus[898] as the leading tribe of the country. But though the\r\nprovince of Fars now embraces a considerable range of country and\r\ndiversity of climate, all that is recorded of the ancient Persians\r\nwould seem to connect them particularly with its ruder and more\r\nmountainous parts: for we have every reason to believe that Herodotus\r\nspoke truly when he described the Persians, properly so called, as\r\npoor, and their country as hard and barren in comparison with the rich\r\nvalleys of Media, which at an early date attracted and repaid the\r\nlabours of agriculture. It was inhabited, as Herodotus[899] says, κατὰ\r\nκώμας, that is, in the Pelasgian fashion, at the time when Dejoces\r\nacquired the throne.\r\n\r\nThe conflict of race between a bold highland people of superior\r\nenergies, and the more advanced, but also more relaxed inhabitants\r\nof the more favoured district, is indicated even amidst the\r\nindistinctness of the earliest efforts of history. Ethnologically the\r\ngeneral character of the movement is that of a pressure, to adopt the\r\nlanguage of Dr. Donaldson[900], of the High upon the Low Iranians; I\r\nwould be understood, however, to signify by the terms High and Low a\r\ndistinction in language and not one in altitude of site. The overthrow\r\nof the Median empire by the Persians, related in different forms by\r\nCtesias and Herodotus, and again in Holy Scripture, whatever be its\r\nchronological epoch, may be taken as a great crisis in the struggle,\r\nat which the High Iranians established themselves in the country of\r\nthe Low, and in permanent political ascendancy among them. The Magian\r\nrevolution, doubtless a great reaction against this ascendancy, was of\r\nshort duration. The invasion of Media by the Scythians, which Herodotus\r\nhas reported as proceeding from beyond the Euxine and the Palus\r\nMæotis, but which was more probably from the east of the Caspian[901],\r\nindicates, it is probable, another form of this reaction. This invasion\r\ntook place under Cyaxares, the grandson of Dejoces: and we may perhaps\r\nconsider Media as having at this time received Persian influences,\r\npossibly by the immigration of groups of Persian families, before the\r\ngeneral ascendancy of that race, just as we see the Æolid houses, and\r\nthe family of Perseus, finding their way into Southern Greece before\r\nthe days of the Achæan race, and of the general Hellenic ascendancy in\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nThe resemblance of the modern Persian to the modern High German\r\nlanguage has been observed[902]: and it has even been thought\r\nprobable, for reasons which will presently be considered, that the\r\nGerman name may have been derived from that quarter. The Hellic\r\ningredient of the Greek tongue is referred to a similar origin. On the\r\nother hand, we are told that a traveller[903], taking a popular rather\r\nthan a scientific view of language, has noticed the strong resemblance\r\nbetween the Latin and the modern Sclavonian forms. Again, the structure\r\nof the Latin language, from its repelling certain more modern\r\ntendencies of the Greek, is taken to indicate an antiquity beyond that\r\nof the Greek: and there is also an opinion that the older Greek forms,\r\nlike the Latin, bear marks of correspondence with the Sclavonic. All\r\nthis would tend to sustain the belief that the Pelasgians, who formed\r\nthe older portion, and the basis, of the population of Italy and\r\nGreece, were offshoots from the old, or Low Iranian tribes: and that\r\nthe more recent element was High Iranian or Persian.\r\n\r\n_Relation of Germans to Celts._\r\n\r\nEthnological affinities, illustrative of what has here been advanced,\r\nhave not escaped the attention of the Greek and Roman writers. What\r\nStrabo has said on this subject is particularly deserving of notice.\r\nHis derivation of the German name from the Latin word _Germanus_ may\r\nindeed be passed by as a notion which cannot be maintained, although it\r\nis supported by the opinion of Tacitus[904], that the name was recent:\r\nsince even Roman inscriptions show, that it existed three hundred years\r\nbefore that historian. It is however very remarkable, that Strabo\r\nasserts the Germans and the Celts to have been nearly associated:\r\nμικρὸν ἐξαλλάττοντες τοῦ Κελτικοῦ φύλου τῷ τε πλεονασμῷ τῆς\r\nἀγριότητος, καὶ τοῦ μεγέθους, καὶ τῆς ξανθότητος, τἄλλα δὲ παραπλήσιοι\r\nκαὶ μορφαῖς, καὶ ἤθεσι, καὶ βίοις ὄντες[905].\r\n\r\n_And to Hellenes._\r\n\r\nNow, the result of all that we have drawn from Homer thus far would\r\nbe to connect the Celts with the Pelasgi, with Media, and with the\r\nLow Iranian countries: the ‘Germans’ with the Helli and with Persia.\r\nObserve, then, how the differences, noted by Strabo between Celts and\r\n‘Germans,’ correspond with the Homeric differences between Helli and\r\nPelasgi. First, as to ἀγριότης: let us call to mind the history of the\r\nname Ἀργεῖος; the use of Ἄγριος as an early Hellic proper name; the\r\nabsence of names of this class among the Pelasgians; the rude manners\r\nof the Helli and the Pheres; the pacific habits, wealth, and advanced\r\nagriculture of the Pelasgian populations. Then as to stature: how this\r\ngift has Diana for its goddess, how it is a standing and essential\r\nelement of beauty for women as well as men, how the Greek Chiefs in the\r\nThird Iliad are distinguished from the crowd by size,\r\n\r\n    ὥς μοι καὶ τόνδ’ ἄνδρα πελώριον ἐξονομήνῃς,\r\n    ὅστις ὅδ’ ἐστὶν Ἀχαιὸς ἀνὴρ ἠΰς τε μέγας τε[906],\r\n\r\nand how Achilles, the bravest and mightiest chief of this army, was the\r\nfirst also in beauty and in size; for Ajax is always recorded as next\r\nto him, and at the same time as before all others[907]; except Nireus,\r\nwho was beautiful, but who as a soldier was mere trash.\r\n\r\nAnd, lastly, as to the auburn hair, which was with Homer in such\r\nesteem. Menelaus is ξανθός (_passim_); so is Meleager (Il. ii. 642);\r\nso is Rhadamanthus (Od. iv. 564); Agamede (Il. xi. 739); Ulysses (Od.\r\nxiii. 399, 431); lastly, Achilles (Il. i. 197). But never once, I\r\nthink, does Homer bestow this epithet upon a Pelasgian name. None of\r\nthe Trojan royal family, so renowned for beauty, are ξανθοί: none of\r\nthe Chiefs, not even Euphorbus[908], of whose flowing hair the Poet has\r\ngiven us so beautiful and even so impassioned a description. Nothing\r\nPelasgian, but Ceres[909] the καλλιπλόκαμος, is admitted to the honour\r\nof the epithet. It could hardly be denied to the goddess of the ruddy\r\nharvest:\r\n\r\n    Excutit et flavas aurea terra comas[910].\r\n\r\nNow Tacitus, describing the Germani, gives them _truces et cærulei\r\noculi, rutilæ comæ, magna corpora_[911]. His treatise supplies many\r\nother points of comparison.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, to compare the names of Scythæ, Getæ, Gothi, Massagetæ,\r\nMœsi, Mysi, as carrying the marks of their own relationship; and the\r\nreader will find in Dr. Donaldson’s New Cratylus[912] the various\r\nindications recorded by ancient writers of the extension of the Medians\r\nover Northern Egypt: namely, from Herodotus (v. 9), Pliny (Hist. Nat.\r\nvi. 7), and Diodorus (ii. 43). The last of these authors recognises\r\nthe similarity of tongue between Greeks and Hyperboreans (ii. 47):\r\nand Clemens Alexandrinus, after reciting a series of inventions which\r\nthe Greeks owed to the barbarians, records among them the saying of\r\nAnacharsis, whom some of the Greeks placed among their ‘seven wise\r\nmen,’ and adds ἐμοὶ δὲ πάντες Ἕλληνες Σκυθίζουσι[913].\r\n\r\nAnd again, Herodotus (i. 125) gives us a list of names belonging to the\r\ndifferent tribes of Persia: the Persia, that is to say, of his own day.\r\nSix of these are settled or agricultural, and four nomad. Of the six,\r\nthe Pasargadæ are the first. Then come the Μαράφιοι and Μάσπιοι. Three\r\nmore follow, of whom one is named Γερμάνιοι. The precise correspondence\r\nof name immediately suggests that the modern Germans derive their\r\nappellation from this Persian tribe. But it is customary to derive that\r\nname from _wehr_ and _man_, or from _heer_ and _man_, thus giving it a\r\nmilitary sense: and it is also observed[914] that, if it had borne this\r\nsense in the time of Herodotus, he would probably have assigned to it a\r\nhigher place in his list. But he does not give us to understand, that\r\nhe means to point out these tribal names as being the descriptive names\r\nof the various classes in one and the same homogeneous community, or\r\nas having, in any degree, the character of caste. To the first three,\r\nindeed, he assigns a political supremacy: for they were the tribes by\r\nwhose means Cyrus effected his designs. But the idea of particular\r\nemployments, and social duties, does not seem to belong even to these,\r\nand there is no sign of it with the others. It may have been that the\r\nΓερμάνιοι meant martial, as Κεφάλληνες seems to have meant Head or\r\nChief Hellenes, and yet that, as the latter were not the chiefs of all\r\nthe Hellenes, so the former were not the soldiery of all Persia. Again,\r\nas the Δωριέες of Homer lay undistinguished in the Hellenic mass,\r\nyet afterwards, and on the very same arena, attained to a long-lived\r\nsupremacy, so, and yet more naturally, may it have happened that a\r\ntribe, secondary in Persia itself, may have taken or acquired the lead\r\nin a northward and westward migration from it, and may have given its\r\nname to the people, which afterwards coagulated (so to speak) around\r\nthat migration.\r\n\r\n_Traces in Homer of the Persian name._\r\n\r\nThere are not wanting either Homeric or post-Homeric traces of a\r\nconnection between early Greece and Persia. In Homer, Perseus, father\r\nof a line of Peloponnesian kings, is the son of Jupiter and Danae[915].\r\nA son of Nestor bears the same name[916]. We have also the name\r\nΠερσεφόνεια, wife of Aidoneus or Pluto, and Perse, daughter of Oceanus,\r\nwho bears Circe and Æetes to Ἠέλιος, the Sun[917].\r\n\r\nWhen Homer makes Perseus the son of Jupiter, he certainly implies of\r\nthis sovereign, as of Minos, that he had no known paternal ancestry,\r\nand perhaps that he falsely claimed a maternal one, in the country\r\nwhere he attained to fame. But further, it very decidedly appears from\r\nthe use of the word Ἀργεῖοι for the subjects of the Perseids, and from\r\nthe intense attachment of the Homeric Juno to that family, that they\r\nwere an Hellenic house, following upon the probably Egyptian dynasty of\r\nthe Danaids. With them appears to begin what Homer esteems to be the\r\nreally national history. Perseus therefore probably may have brought\r\nhis name direct from among the Hellenes of the north. Why should it not\r\nhave come to the Helli from Persia? Let it be recollected that we have\r\ntwo other links with the east supplied: one in Perse, daughter of the\r\nEastern Oceanus, and bride of the Sun, the other in Persephoneia, whose\r\nἄλσεα, as I hope to show in treating of the Outer Geography, are in the\r\nsame quarter.\r\n\r\nIn Herodotus we find a tradition that Perseus visited Cepheus[918],\r\nthe Persian king, at the period when the people were called by the\r\nGreeks Cephenes; that he married his daughter Andromeda, and had\r\na son, Perses, who remained behind him, succeeded Cepheus, and\r\ngave his name to the country. This tale has the appearance of a\r\npalpable fiction, intended to cover what may have been a fact; that\r\nPerseus--who in Homer has himself all the appearance of an immigrant\r\ninto Peloponnesus--was a stranger, and derived his name from that of\r\nthe Persians. Now this was the version current among the Persians;\r\nwho reported that Perseus, born one of themselves, became an Hellene,\r\nbut that his ancestors had not been Hellenes. To this Persian account\r\nHerodotus appears to give his own adhesion: and he states that the\r\nGreeks reckoned Hellenic kings up to Perseus[919], but that before\r\nhim they were Egyptian. This is in entire harmony with what can be\r\ngathered from the indirect, but consistent and converging, notices\r\nsupplied by Homer. And again, the whole mass of the later reports\r\nconcerning Perseus keep him in close relation with that outer circle\r\nof traditions, which I have designated as Phœnician; with the Gorgons\r\nof Hades, with Tartessus on the Ocean, with Æthiopia and Atlas.\r\nLastly; the continuance of the name as a royal name, down to the very\r\nextinction of nationality in Greece--for the last Macedonian king was\r\na Perseus--may probably be connected with a stream of tradition, that\r\ndrew from Persia the oldest of the national monarchs.\r\n\r\n_The Achæan name in Persia._\r\n\r\nAgain, we find that the name Ἀχαιοὶ was the great descriptive name of\r\nthe Hellic races in the Homeric age. Yet it is without any note of\r\nan Hellic or European origin. Let us therefore see, whether in the\r\nEast we can find anything that stands, even though at first sight\r\ndisguisedly, in affinity with it. Now Herodotus tells us, that in the\r\nleading tribe of Pasargadæ there was a family (φρήτρη), from which\r\ncame the Persian kings; the family of the Ἀχαιμενίδαι. Even if it\r\nwere not easy to trace the mode of the relationship, it would seem\r\ninevitable to recognise a connection between the name Ἀχαιμένης, or\r\nwhatever is the proper Persian root of this Greek patronymic, and those\r\nἈχαιοὶ whom we find at the head of the Greek races. This connection\r\nreceives a singular illustration from Strabo, who in describing the\r\nAsiatic country called Aria, which gives a name to the Arian race,\r\nstates that it has three cities called after their founders, Artacaena,\r\nAlexandria, and Achaia. Artacaes was a distinguished Persian, of the\r\narmy of Xerxes. The name of Alexander speaks for itself. With respect\r\nto either of these, Strabo may be understood to speak of what may, from\r\nthe respective dates, have been genuine historical traditions. But he\r\nknew and could know nothing of a Persian Achæus, as the founder of the\r\nthird city. And the Greek Achæus, if he existed at all, belonged to\r\nanother country, and to a pre-historic antiquity. The real force of\r\nthe tradition which reports that these cities bore the names of their\r\nfounders, seems, however, to be pretty obvious. It must surely mean\r\nthis: that they had borne the same names at all times within the memory\r\nof man. Thus we have the Achæan name thrown back, by a local testimony\r\nsubsisting in Strabo’s time, to a remote antiquity: there it finds a\r\nholding-ground in the Achæmenidæ of Herodotus: and both these authors\r\nbecome witnesses, I think, to the derivation of the Ἀχαιοὶ of Homer\r\nfrom Persia[920]. I do not mean that the Achæmenes, who, according to\r\nthe Behistun Inscription, gave his name to the Achæmenidæ, was the\r\nfather of the Achæans of the poems, for he appears to have lived only\r\nfive generations before Darius. But the coincidence of name between\r\nthe ruling family in Persia, and the dominant race in Greece, bears\r\nwitness, in harmony with other testimonies, to a presumptive identity\r\nof origin.\r\n\r\nIt appears, too, that the name thus viewed may well have had its root\r\nin the ancient Arian language, if we judge from its extant forms.\r\nThe word signifying ‘friends,’ according to Sir H. Rawlinson, is in\r\nSanscrit _sakhá_, and in Persian _hakhá_.\r\n\r\n  “The name Achæmenes signifies ‘friendly,’ or ‘possessing friends,’\r\n  being formed of a Persian word _hakhá_, corresponding to the Sanscrit\r\n  _sakhá_, and an attributive affix equivalent to the Sanscrit mat,\r\n  which forms the nominative in _man_. H. R.[921]”\r\n\r\nThe word, then, if we may rely on this high authority, undergoes no\r\nother change, on passing into the Greek tongue, than the loss of the\r\ninitial aspirate, (while the second is retained in χ,) and the addition\r\nof the Greek termination ος or ιος. In this description of a ruling\r\nrace by their common bond as associates, there is something that\r\nresembles the European and feudal name of peers.\r\n\r\nThere is indeed another name still existing in Persia, that of the\r\nEelliats or itinerant tribes, the form of which, and the circumstances\r\nunder which it appears, will shortly be noticed[922].\r\n\r\nWe have now obtained various lights, which point out to us the Persians\r\nas the probable ancestry of the Greeks. It still remains to learn,\r\nwhether from the history of ancient Persia we can raise a presumption\r\nthat there were, through resemblances subsisting there, marked signs of\r\naffinity between the two.\r\n\r\n_The Persians according to Herodotus._\r\n\r\nHerodotus has given us a remarkable, and apparently a careful, account\r\nof the ancient Persians, both as to religion and as to manners, which\r\nupon the whole both exhibits striking points of resemblance to Greece,\r\nand likewise tends to attach that resemblance to the Hellic rather than\r\nthe Pelasgian race.\r\n\r\nIn making the comparison, we must allow specially for two sources of\r\nerror. The Hellic tribes of Homer’s time had been probably for not\r\nless than eight or ten generations (since we trace the Dardanians on\r\ntheir own ground for seven generations, the Perseids and Æolids for\r\nsix) detached from the parent stock, and might well have modified their\r\ncharacter and customs, especially since they had mingled with the\r\nPelasgians in the plains. And again, the account of Herodotus is later\r\nprobably by 500 years or more, than the manners described in Homer. The\r\nPersians of his day had long been mixed with the Medes: and had, as he\r\ntells us[923], adopted their costume: probably much else along with it.\r\n\r\n_The comparison as to religious belief._\r\n\r\nThe Persians, says Herodotus[924], have no temples, altars, nor statues\r\nof the gods. Tacitus[925] gives a like account of the Germans. Of these\r\nHomer only enables us to trace altars with clearness as having been\r\nadopted by the Hellenic races at the period of the _Troica_. But the\r\ntendency to sacerdotal development among the Pelasgi may have had its\r\ncounterpart in ‘the symbolism and complicated ceremonial of Media[926].’\r\n\r\nThey worship Jupiter from high places. So did Hector. We have no reason\r\nto make the same assertion of the Trojans generally: but the place\r\ngiven to Jupiter on Ida, and the whole Olympian fabric, probably also\r\nthe plan of scaling heaven by heaping mountains one on another, all\r\nbelong to the same train of thought.\r\n\r\nThey, if we are to adopt the statement, call the whole circuit of the\r\nheaven by the name of Jupiter. This same is the share of the universe,\r\nwhich, in the Homeric mythology, falls to the lot of Jupiter, and the\r\nname Ζεὺς is said to be identical with the Sanscrit _Dyaus_, meaning\r\n‘the sky[927]:’ a sense which we find in the _sub dio_ and _sub Jove_\r\nof the Latin writers, belonging to the Augustan age. This elemental\r\nconception of him, however, is probably more Median than Persian.\r\n\r\nThey did not originally worship Venus (ἀρχῆθεν); but they learned the\r\nworship of her from others, apparently the Medes or Assyrians. This\r\nremarkably accords with the case of the Hellenes of Homer, who seem\r\nonly to have been drawing towards, rather than to have accepted fully,\r\nthe worship of Venus in his time[928].\r\n\r\nThey considered fire to be a god[929]: differing in this from the\r\nEgyptians, who held it to be an animal.\r\n\r\nSo we find that the worship of Vulcan appears to be Hellic more than\r\nPelasgian, and that the fable of his origin distinctly points to what\r\nwas for Homer the farthest east[930].\r\n\r\nThey paid a particular reverence to rivers[931]. Of this we have the\r\namplest evidence in Homer among the Greeks as to Alpheus, Spercheus,\r\nand the River of Scheria: rivers, too, were honoured by a more distinct\r\npersonification than was attributed to other natural objects. The\r\nScamander is, indeed, similarly treated. But this is an exception\r\nto the general mode of representation: and no other Trojan River is\r\nactively personified[932]. Simois is addressed (Il. xxi. 308) by\r\nScamander; but is himself a mute.\r\n\r\nThese, however, are particular points: let us also consider more at\r\nlarge the general outline which Herodotus has given us of the Persian\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nThey did not, he says, consider as the Greeks did that the gods were\r\n(ἀνθρωποφυέας) anthropophuistic[933]. They called the entire circle\r\nof heaven by the name of Jupiter. They originally worshipped no gods\r\nexcept the sun, the moon, the earth, fire, water, and the winds.\r\nAfterwards they learned from the Assyrians and Arabians to worship\r\nΟὐρανίη under the name of Mitra.\r\n\r\nI shall not attempt in this place to discuss the difficult subject of\r\nthe Persian or Magian religions as they are in themselves; farther than\r\nto observe, that they appear to have been different. Here we have only\r\nto consider the relation, if any, between that system which the sketch\r\nby Herodotus describes, and the religion of heroic Greece.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the religion of the Persians[934], either as anterior\r\nto, or as independent of that of Zoroaster and the Magi, embraced, (1)\r\nthe belief in one Supreme and incorporeal God, and (2) the worship of\r\nthe host of heaven.\r\n\r\nThe sketch of Herodotus appears to be a representation of this\r\nreligion: it contains no evidence of dualism, and fire-worship appears\r\nin it only as a subordinate characteristic. Only it would appear as\r\nif the historian had reflected upon Persia the leading idea of the\r\nGreek mythology, namely, that which invested Jupiter, as the supreme\r\ndeity, especially with the charge of the sky and atmosphere: and that\r\nwhen he says the Persians call the heavens Jupiter, he probably means\r\nthat they consider the Supreme Being not to be circumscribed, but\r\nto pervade all space. The powers of outward Nature were doubtless\r\nworshipped by them, in the first instance, as organs of the Supreme\r\nBeing.\r\n\r\nIn this sketch there is something to remind us of a primitive religion,\r\nor at least to suggest the traditional forms in which that religion was\r\nconveyed: it teaches the unity of God, and then steps only into the\r\nmost natural and proximate form of deviation. It is well called by Dr.\r\nDöllinger ‘a monotheism with polytheistic elements[935].’\r\n\r\nIt is unlike the Homeric religion, inasmuch as it does not contain any\r\nevidences of traditive derivation nearly so abundant or so specific as,\r\nI think, we shall find manifest in the Homeric system[936]. But then we\r\nmust remember that it is junior, by many centuries, to the system of\r\nHomer: and that these evidences had become far less palpable, at the\r\nepoch when Herodotus lived, in the contemporary religion of Greece.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, with respect to its human, inventive, and\r\npolytheistic element, it is evidently akin to the Homeric religion;\r\nunder which Nature is everywhere animated and uplifted, and teems\r\nat every pore with some expression of divinity. The Greek scheme is\r\nindeed still more human, (for it takes everywhere the human dress,)\r\nmore poetical and imaginative, than the Persian one; but the generative\r\nprinciple is one and the same, namely, the impersonation, though not\r\nnecessarily in both cases alike under human conditions, of all powers\r\nobserved and felt in outward nature. The whole group may well remind\r\nus, both in letter and in spirit, of the invocation of Agamemnon,\r\nwhich after Jupiter enumerates the sun, the rivers, and the earth:\r\nthough it also adds the infernal gods[937]. We find from another place\r\nin Herodotus, that he knew the Persians to believe in an infernal\r\ndeity, to whom they offered human sacrifices[938].\r\n\r\nIf we conceive the Persians moving westward, and gathering mental\r\nand imaginative, as well as warlike and political energy, on their\r\nway, we shall see that they are only enlarging the scheme reported in\r\nHerodotus by a consistent application of its principles, and following\r\nthem out in an imaginative and dramatic spirit to their results, when\r\nthey people every meadow, wood, and fountain with deity, and when\r\nthey construct the great Olympian court for heaven, with its several\r\nreflections; in the sea, around the throne of Nereus, and, in the\r\nnether world, under the gloomy sway of Aidoneus and Persephone.\r\n\r\n_As to ritual and other resemblances._\r\n\r\nHerodotus[939] also gives us a sketch of the Persian system as to\r\nritual. Each person sacrificed for himself: without libation, music,\r\ngarlands, or cakes: only in a becoming spot, and having the tiara\r\nwreathed usually with myrtle. When he had performed the essential part\r\nof the function, a _Magus_ recited a religious chant; and no one could\r\nperform sacrifice except in presence of a _Magus_. It is plain that we\r\nsee here, if not, as Mr. Blakesley thinks[940], the confusion, at any\r\nrate the combination, of the genuine Persian with the Median ritual.\r\nThe presence of the Magian was required, or let us suppose that it was\r\nsimply usual: yet he did not offer the sacrifice. This was perhaps\r\nthe compromise between the sacerdotal system of the Pelasgians, and\r\nthe independent or patriarchal principle of the Hellenes, who exhibit\r\nto us first ὑποφῆται, then μάντιες and θυοσκόοι, but who seem to know\r\nnothing, as among themselves, of priests.\r\n\r\nLike the Hellic races, the Persians of old were remarkable for personal\r\nmodesty. They did not practice any unnatural vice, until they learned\r\nit from Greece[941]. They placed an extremely high value on their own\r\nrace, which they esteemed far before all others[942]. Different social\r\nrelations among those who were intimate were marked by differences in\r\nthe kiss[943]. Equals kissed with the mouths, unequals by the mouth\r\nof one on the cheek of the other: while persons greatly inferior fell\r\nprostrate. In the Odyssey, Ulysses kisses his son Telemachus (doubtless\r\non the face) (Od. xvi. 190), and Penelope kisses Telemachus on the head\r\nand eyes (xvii. 39); but Ulysses kisses the king of Egypt, when he is\r\na suppliant (xiv. 279) on the knees, and the slave Dolius on the hands\r\n(xxiv. 398): he kisses Eumæus and Philœtius on the head and hands,\r\nwhile they embrace, but do not kiss him (xxi. 224, 5). Dolius held the\r\nhand, and no more, of Ulysses. But the chief is kissed on the head and\r\neyes by his grandmother (Od. xix. 417.)\r\n\r\nLike the Greeks, the Persians shore the hair in mourning. They held\r\nlying to be the most disgraceful of all things. It was also disgraceful\r\nto be called a woman[944]. Again, the Persians in the time of Crœsus\r\nwere highlanders[945], destitute of all the comforts of life, just\r\nas Achilles describes the Helli round Dodona. Like the καρηκομόωντες\r\nἈχαιοὶ, they wore their hair long[946].\r\n\r\nAll these are points of similarity. Upon the other hand, there are\r\ntwo points of discrepancy, which may be noticed. The Persians had many\r\nwives and concubines: and they did not burn their dead. Upon the first\r\nof these points of discrepancy with the Greeks, the Persians were in\r\nharmony with, at least, the ruling race of Troas; and polygamy must\r\nalways be an affair of ruling races, or of a select few.\r\n\r\nA fragment of the old historian Xanthus[947] would lead us to suppose\r\nthat they derived this habit from the Medes, who, according to that\r\nauthor, had no law of incest, and freely exchanged their wives.\r\n\r\nOn the second point, they differed from Troy: for the Trojans, like the\r\nGreeks, burned their dead.\r\n\r\nIt was also the Persian custom to introduce women to their\r\nbanquets[948]. There is, however, a trace of this last-named practice\r\nat least in the Olympian banquets of Homer. And it is plain that Arete,\r\nthe queen of Alcinous, was at the Phæacian banquet (Od. vii. 49, 50,\r\n147, 8): but this may have been due to the unusual honour in which she\r\nwas held (Od. vii. 67). More ordinarily the Greek women do not appear\r\nat meals with men.\r\n\r\nThus far we seem to be carried by the text of Herodotus standing alone.\r\nAnd it should be borne in mind, that Ctesias, as he is reported in\r\nPhotius[949], though he condemns Herodotus as a teller of untruth, and\r\ncontradicts him in his narrative, does not question his account of\r\nreligion and manners.\r\n\r\n_Evidence of the Behistun Inscription._\r\n\r\nBut the discovery and deciphering by Rawlinson of the Behistun\r\nInscription throws an additional light upon this question, and one\r\nhighly confirmatory of the general conclusions towards which we have\r\ntended. The Magian, called Smerdis[950] by Herodotus, appears in this\r\nInscription under the name of Gomates: and it is now demonstrated,\r\nthat the revolution which he wrought, or of which he took advantage,\r\nand which was reversed by Darius, was religious as well as political.\r\nFor, says the Inscription, ‘when Cambyses had proceeded to Egypt, the\r\nstate became irreligious.’ It is then related that Gomates obtained\r\nthe empire. But, says Darius, ‘I adored Ormuzd. Ormuzd brought me\r\naid.’ ‘Then did I, with faithful men, slay Gomates the Magian.... By\r\nthe grace of Ormuzd I became king. Ormuzd gave me the empire.... The\r\nrites which Gomates the Magian had introduced I prohibited. I restored\r\nthe chants, and the worship, to the State, and to those families,\r\nwhich Gomates the Magian had deprived of them.’ Thus Darius represents\r\nin this great transaction the Persian party and its religion, as\r\nagainst the Medians and the Magi. Hence arises a direct presumption\r\nthat the Magi were properly a Median class, and were adopted into the\r\nPersian system, only in consequence of the connection and political\r\namalgamation of the Persians with the Medes.\r\n\r\nAgain, in a political point of view, we have the Persians clearly\r\nexhibited as standing in the same relation to the Medes, which the\r\nHelli held to the Pelasgi. The needy highlanders[951] come down upon\r\nand overpower the richer and more advanced inhabitants of the central\r\nvalleys: under the Magian upstart, the latter take advantage of\r\nthe absence of the sovereign to rebel, but they are, after a short\r\ninterval, finally put down.\r\n\r\n_The political system of Darius._\r\n\r\nDarius, having obtained the throne, and established the Persian\r\nsupremacy, proceeded to organize the empire; and he appears to have\r\ndisplayed in this great sphere the same thoroughly political mind\r\nas the Hellenic races exhibited in their diminutive, but still\r\nextraordinary polities. He divided the empire by a cadastral system,\r\nunder provincial governors; and he established everywhere fixed rates\r\nof tribute. These were great departures from the old Greek form of\r\nsovereignty: but we are now five centuries later than the heroic age:\r\nand, besides, we must remember that the paternal and everywhere fixed\r\nforms of government, which will suffice for very small states, are\r\nnot always applicable to large ones. Yet, as we learn from Herodotus,\r\nthe innovations of Darius were much resented by the Persians, who\r\nunder Cyrus, and even under Cambyses, knew nothing of fixed rates of\r\ntaxation, but offered benevolences (δῶρα) to the throne[952]; and a\r\nsaying came into vogue, that Cyrus was a father, Cambyses an autocrat\r\n(δεσπότης), and Darius a tradesman (κάπηλος).\r\n\r\n  ‘Landlord of England art thou now, not King[953].’\r\n\r\nWe seem to have here an emphatic testimony to the original identity of\r\nthe Persian and Hellic, or Hellenic ideas of government.\r\n\r\nIt is also worthy of remark, that in the case of Minos, who seems\r\nto have held a large and disjointed empire, we have traditional,\r\nand even Homeric indications of some proceeding not wholly unlike\r\nthis of Darius. For this prince, according to Thucydides, governed\r\nthe islands through his sons, that is, by a provincial organization\r\nunder local officers[954]; in Homer we find Rhadamanthus acting at a\r\ndistance, probably on his behalf; and we may perhaps hence conceive,\r\nthat there was truth in the tradition, afterwards so odious, that he\r\nimposed tribute upon the then Pelasgian Attica. Minos indeed was a\r\nreputed Phœnician: but in Homer the Phœnician and Persian traditions\r\nare closely combined, and the poet appears to have treated Phœnicia as\r\nthe medium, perhaps even the symbol, of much that was Persian. Even\r\ngeographically I believe that he placed the two countries in very close\r\nproximity.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable also, that we may consider the long continued\r\napplication of the term Βασιλεὺς by the Greeks to the Persian kings, as\r\nhaving reference to an original identity of race and manners. It had\r\nbeen their own original name for a monarch. When the ancient monarchies\r\npassed away, so did the name from their usage; and the possessor of\r\nsinglehanded power among the Greeks, having in all cases obtained it by\r\nthe suppression of liberty, came to be called τύραννος; but the word\r\nΒασιλεὺς continued to be used with reference to Persia, where the chain\r\nof traditions had not been broken, and where monarchy had never ceased\r\nto prevail; so that there had been no reason for a change of usage,\r\nor for a deviation from the ancient respect and reverence towards the\r\npossessor of a throne. Again, the traditional throne of Lacedæmon\r\ncontinued to be held by Βασιλεῖς[955].\r\n\r\nFor the word Βασιλεὺς was one of no ordinary force; and down to a very\r\nlate date it must have been surrounded with venerable recollections.\r\nIt was borne by the emperors of Constantinople, and even at times\r\nstickled for by them, as a title distinguishing them from the emperors\r\nof the West. Though essentially Greek, it was also written in the\r\nLatin character. Unlike the word _Rex_, it appears never to have been\r\napplied to any ruler who exercised a merely derivative power. It\r\ntravelled so far westward as to our own island: and King Edgar, in a\r\ncharter, calls himself _Anglorum Basileus, omniumque Regum, Insularum,\r\nOceanique Britanniam circumjacentis, cunctarumque nationum, quæ infra\r\neam includuntur, Imperator et Dominus_[956].\r\n\r\n_Hellenic traits in modern Persia._\r\n\r\nEven now, after so many centuries of vicissitude, the Persian presents\r\nnumerous points of resemblance, perhaps more than we can find in\r\nModern Greece itself, to the primitive and heroic Greek of Homer.\r\nUpon the whole, without doubt, he stands upon a lower level. Lying,\r\ndrunkenness, unnatural vice[957], the degradation of women, are all\r\nnow rife in Persia. But such things were to be expected after so many\r\nages of estrangement from the revealed knowledge of God, of moral\r\ncontamination, and of political depression and misgovernment. But\r\nwith allowance on these accounts, and on the score of the changes to\r\nMagianism and Mahometanism, the old features are still retained, and\r\nthey present to our view abundant presumptions of identity.\r\n\r\nThe Persians[958] are still noted for hospitality and love of display:\r\nfor highly refined manners and great personal beauty. They have still\r\nan intense love of poetry, of song, and also of music, while their\r\npractice of this art is rude and simple: they still associate poetry\r\n(sometimes licentious, as in the Eighth Odyssey) with recitation and\r\nthe banquet; and, when Malcolm wrote, printing was still unknown among\r\nthe useful arts of the country. They are passionately fond of horses,\r\nmuch given to the chase and to the practice of horse-racing[959]. Men\r\nof letters are esteemed, and their society valued, even as in the\r\nOdyssey the Bard is among those whom men are accustomed to invite to\r\ndinner[960]. On the occasion of a marriage they celebrate prolonged\r\nfeasts of three days for the poor, and from that up to thirty or forty\r\ndays for the highest classes. Amidst great depravity, much of filial\r\npiety and of maternal influence remains[961]. It is observed that they\r\ndo not usually allude to women by name[962]. There is an approach to\r\nthis abstinence in the Homeric poems; where names of men, and likewise\r\nof goddesses, in the vocative are frequent, but I am not sure that we\r\nhave any instances of a woman addressed by her proper name throughout\r\nthe Iliad or Odyssey. But certainly one of the most curious notes of\r\nsimilarity is that, together with their high and refined politeness,\r\nthey retain a liability, when under great excitement, to a sort of\r\ncannibal ferocity. A recent writer states[963] the following anecdotes.\r\nA few years ago, the chieftain of a tribe slew in a feud the chieftain\r\nof another. Shortly afterwards he was attacked while on a journey,\r\ntaken after vigorous resistance, and put to death. His heart, if we may\r\nbelieve the recital, was then roasted, and was eaten by the mother of\r\nhis former victim. And again; the husband of a beautiful young woman\r\nhad been slain by a rival chief. The widow, who had been much attached\r\nto the dead warrior, would minutely describe the incidents of the\r\ncatastrophe, and then, lifting up her hands to heaven, would pray to\r\nAli to deliver the murderer into her hands, ‘that having cut out his\r\nheart, I may make it into kibabs, and eat it before I die.’ These are\r\ncertainly most pointed proofs that Homer has proceeded with his usual\r\nveracity, as an observer and chronicler of man, when he shocks us by\r\nmaking Achilles wish he could eat Hector, and Hecuba wish she could\r\neat Achilles; nay, even when he yet further proves that this idea was\r\nfamiliar to his race and age, by making Jupiter tell Juno, she would,\r\nhe believes, be well content to eat Priam and all his sons.\r\n\r\n_The Eelliats: Media and the Pelasgi._\r\n\r\nTo appreciate fully, however, the resemblances of Greek and Persian,\r\nwe must take the latter as he is found in the military tribes of the\r\nprovince of Pars or Fars. The members of these tribes are chiefly\r\nhorsemen, all soldiers, and all brigands. But they abhor the name and\r\ncharacter of thief; plunder is redeemed by violence in their eyes,\r\nand it is evidently accompanied with the practice of a generous and\r\ndelicate hospitality. Elsewhere in Persia many degrading customs\r\nprevail, and women are regarded chiefly with a view to sensual use;\r\nbut among these military tribes they are more highly valued, and are\r\nof remarkable modesty and chastity; yet they have an innocent freedom\r\nin their good offices to strangers[964], which at once recalls the\r\nGreek maidens of the Odyssey. Adultery is capitally punishable.\r\nAlexander the Great endeavoured to bring these tribes to settle, and\r\nto adopt agricultural habits; but they have defied his efforts, and\r\nstill remain like the old Helli of the hills, when they hung over\r\nthe Pelasgians of the valleys. It is to be observed, that they are\r\nparticularly mentioned in the Eteo-Persian province of Fars: and\r\nfurther, that they bear the name Eelleat[965], which at least presents\r\na striking resemblance to that of the Helli. The aspirate would pass\r\ninto the doubled ε, like ἡλιος into ἠελιος, or ἕδνα into ἔεδνα. So\r\nHelli is the equivalent of Eelli.\r\n\r\nIn sum, the ancient Persians, like the Helli, were of Arian race,\r\nof highland character and habits, inhabitants of a rude country:\r\napparently children of Japhet, akin closely to the Hellenes, and less\r\npalpably to the Osci and Umbri.\r\n\r\nThe Medians were _civilly_ in a more advanced stage of social life, and\r\nwere possessed of greater wealth, but endowed with inferior energies.\r\nThey are presumed by many to have been of the race of Ham: to have\r\npeopled Egypt, and to be akin to the ancient Sicani, to the Basques,\r\nthe Esthonians, the Lapps, and the Finns of modern Europe. For the\r\npurposes of this inquiry, they are to be regarded as in all likelihood\r\nthe immediate fountain-head of the wide-spread Pelasgian races.\r\n\r\nWe began under the warning of Mr. Grote: and I fear that we end\r\nunder the implied ban of another very able and recent writer, Dr.\r\nLatham[966]. He considers that we have been put in possession of no\r\nfacts with respect to the Pelasgi more than those three, so slight and\r\nso incapable of effective combination, which are recognised by Mr.\r\nGrote[967]. But the principle he lays down is that, by which I wish\r\nto be tried. He says, the scholar finds a ποῦ στῶ in the _dictum_ of\r\nthis or that author, but the sound ethnologist ‘on the last testified\r\nfact:’ he demands for his basis ‘the existing state of things as either\r\nknown to ourselves, or known to contemporaries capable of learning them\r\nat the period nearest the time under consideration.’ It appears to me\r\nthat the text of Homer, so far as it goes, answers this demand: that\r\nhis accounts of Pelasgian, Hellene, and Achæan, when we can get at\r\nthem, and when we take into view his epoch and means of information,\r\ncome clearly within the meaning of ‘testified facts’ in regard to that\r\nparticular subject matter. I admit that, from their incidental and\r\noften unconscious nature, there is a great liability to error in the\r\nattempt to elicit them: but my assertion is, that the ground under foot\r\nis sound; and that, though we may go astray while travelling it, yet we\r\nare not attempting to tread upon a quicksand. As to the success with\r\nwhich this principle has here been applied, I am not too sanguine; but\r\nI contend earnestly for the principle itself, because I believe that it\r\nwill, when admitted, legitimately work out its own results, and that\r\nthey will make no unimportant addition to the primary facts of that\r\ngreat branch of philosophy, the history, and most of all the early\r\nhistory, of man.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[894] New Cratylus, ch. iv. p. 77.\r\n\r\n[895] Hist. of Persia, ii. 507.\r\n\r\n[896] Quart.

In general confirmation of what has been said above on the\r\nsubject of language, I may refer to the _Römische Geschichte_[968] of\r\nMommsen, which had not come under my eye when the Seventh Section went\r\nto press.\r\n\r\nHis conclusions are;\r\n\r\n1. That the Greek and mid-Italian languages correspond, in what touches\r\nthe rudiments of the material life of man.\r\n\r\n2. That in the higher region of the mind, of religion, and of advanced\r\npolity, this correspondence wholly fails.\r\n\r\n3. That the Græco-Italic agrees with the Sanscrit down to the pastoral\r\nstage of society only, and ceases with the commencement of the\r\nagricultural and settled stage.\r\n\r\n4. That the abstract genius of the Roman religion bears a relation\r\nto the Greek anthropophuism, like that of the full-formed Indian\r\nmythology to the metaphysical scheme of the Zendavesta.\r\n\r\nHe appears to me to cast the balance overmuch on the Roman side: but\r\nhis statement will well repay an attentive consideration.\r\n\r\nHe supplies the following words, which I would add to the lists I have\r\ngiven above. They generally corroborate the conclusions at which I have\r\narrived.\r\n\r\n  χόρτος          hortus.\r\n  κέγχρος         cicer.\r\n  μελίνη          milium.\r\n  πολτὸς          puls.\r\n  μύλη            mola.\r\n  ἄξων   }        axis.\r\n  ἄμ-αξα }\r\n  ποίνη           pœna.\r\n  κρίνω, κρίμα    crimen.\r\n  ταλάω           talio.\r\n  χίτων           tunica.\r\n\r\nAnd, belonging to the higher domain--\r\n\r\n  σκύτος          scutum (with an alteration, or\r\n                  progression of sense).\r\n  λόγχη           lancea.\r\n  τέμενος         templum.\r\n\r\nAmong these, the relationship of τέμενος and templum seems to require\r\nfurther proof.\r\n\r\nI have to add the word κῆλον, which seems to be in nearer\r\ncorrespondence than βέλος is with _telum_. On the other side, I may\r\nnote ἄορ, for _a sword_, and ὄχος, ὄχημα, for _a chariot_, as among the\r\nwords not in correspondence.\r\n\r\nP. 311. Add Φείδιππος. Il. ii. 768.\r\n\r\nP. 313. The statement as to the persons slain by Hector and Mars is\r\ninaccurate. The seven first names are, so far as the text informs us,\r\nundistinguished, except Teuthras, who is called ἀντίθεος; and among\r\nthese seven we have no name, which is clearly of Hellic etymology.\r\nBut the nine others belong to a different part of the action (Il. xi.\r\n301-4), and are expressly called ἡγεμόνες (or officers, Il. ii. 365):\r\nand among these, while we have four names of Hellic complexion, Dolops\r\nand Opheltius are the only two which can be positively assigned to the\r\nPelasgian class.\r\n\r\nP. 380. While I have stated the second sense of the word Ἄργος\r\naccording to what appears to me to be the balance of the evidence, I\r\nadmit it to be a doubtful point whether we ought rather, with Strabo\r\n(p. 365), to understand it preferably as capable of meaning the entire\r\nPeloponnesus.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[968] Leipsic, 1854, vol. i, ch. ii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Note\r\n\r\n\r\nPage headers in the printed book have been converted to headings.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following apparent errors have been corrected:\r\n\r\np. xi \"Campared\" changed to \"Compared\"\r\n\r\np. xii \"Æneas 864\" changed to \"Æneas 486\"\r\n\r\np. 20 \"Aristo’s\" changed to \"Ariosto’s\"\r\n\r\np. 42 \"SECT. 4.\" changed to \"SECT. 5.\"\r\n\r\np. 83 \"xxviii\" changed to \"xxviii.\"\r\n\r\np. 86 \"ἠμίθεοι\" changed to \"ἡμίθεοι\"\r\n\r\np. 92 \"m’ án\" changed to \"m’ ha\"\r\n\r\np. 95 \"349-51.\" changed to \"349-51,\"\r\n\r\np. 98 \"603, 11\" changed to \"603, 611\"\r\n\r\np. 99 \"267, 8.\" changed to \"267, 8,\"\r\n\r\np. 107 \"Ancient Greeee\" changed to \"Ancient Greece\"\r\n\r\np. 114 \"Ἄργειος\" changed to \"Ἀργεῖος\"\r\n\r\np. 147 \"i. 3\" changed to \"i. 3.\"\r\n\r\np. 164 \"itself[269].’\" changed to \"itself[269].”\"\r\n\r\np. 169 \"p. 83.;\" changed to \"p. 83;\"\r\n\r\np. 178 \"by sea,\" changed to \"by sea.\"\r\n\r\np. 178 \"Lacedemonian\" changed to \"Lacedæmonian\"\r\n\r\np. 183 \"wefind\" changed to \"we find\"\r\n\r\np. 195 \"Paus. viii. 1, 2.\" changed to \"Paus. viii. 1. 2.\"\r\n\r\np. 197 \"Paus. viii. 2, 2.\" changed to \"Paus. viii. 2. 2.\"\r\n\r\np. 199 \"ἐθηκ’\" changed to \"ἔθηκ’\"\r\n\r\np. 200 \"city. founding\" changed to \"city-founding\"\r\n\r\np. 203 \"connot\" changed to \"cannot\"\r\n\r\np. 214 \"ἅλς\" changed to \"ἃλς\"\r\n\r\np. 215 \"841.\" changed to \"841,\"\r\n\r\np. 230 \"ἔστηκεν\" changed to \"ἕστηκεν\"\r\n\r\np. 259 \"who in those\" changed to \"those who in\"\r\n\r\np. 259 \"Cretans’....
